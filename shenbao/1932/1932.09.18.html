<p>去年今日日軍大隊進襲瀋陽城情形（車輛盡爲我國之物）</p>
<p>去年今日之夜南滿路日軍。向我瀋陽北大營轟然一砲。打開東北事件之局面。我空前之國難。即於此開始。時輪推進。至於今日。事件之範圍。正在日益擴展。事件之性質。亦在日益嚴重。而我國難週年紀念之日。則匆匆來臨矣。國人於半旗慘拂之下回想過去一年間屈辱悲痛之歷史。遙望前面行將繼續襲來之危機。苟有血氣。當不致渾忘國仇。苟有人心。當不致自抛責職於此國難週年紀念日之來臨。我全國中必有若干之集會紀念。以爲一時之點綴。必有若干人之靜默誌痛。以作例行之舉動。然此於國難之紀念。殊未能發揮其重大之意義。蓋此紀念日之重大意義。乃在促我身處國難中之四萬萬七千萬人之眞正覺悟也。</p>
<p>國人首須覺悟者。今後中日問題之解决。國際法之任何原則。國際規約之任何條文。國際團體之任何决議。皆不足恃。日人自稱其暴行爲「實力發動。」其惟力是視之態度顯然可見。我國今日尙欲以和平方法解决此極大糾紛。其不可能一年來之歷史曾明白報告於吾人。國聯理事會初欲以勸告方式。促日人息手。及去年十月間爲中日爲爭二次集會時。即覺知「遭逢難局。」蓋使日人而果畏國際法原則者。决不致有九一八事變之發動。使日人而果畏國際規約者於國聯引用盟約。美國宣布維持九國公約之日。早已適可而止。其宣言九國公約不適用須修改即巳表示其蔑視此類規約矣。使日人而果畏國際團體之决議者必不致有Ｉ</p>

<p>Ｉ</p>
<p>去年十月間以一票對抗十三票之胆量。亦不致視三月間國聯大會之决議爲具文矣。中國外交當局。對日人承認僞組織事。於前日發表之公文。斥日本違犯國際法規及决議。請九國公約簽字及當事國。注意日人行爲。令顔惠慶報告國聯。此不過外交上應有之手續耳。其爲無效。可不待言。吾人認定今後之中日問題。完全爲力的問題。國際間之法規條約。早成無用之長物矣。　　其次國人應覺悟憑恃外力之危險。東北事件。目前因列强之觀望。國際制裁力未能發揮致使日人肆無顧忌。爲所欲爲。此國人對於國際公理之不張。深爲失望者也。然來日方長。日人之挑釁行爲非不能激動其他强國之反應大則因此引起第二次世界大戰。小則三國强迫還遼之前事。亦未始不可再見惟國際實力發動以後。中國倘無相當之力量。以相周旋。前途危機。亦正可懼。參加大戰所需之力。此姑不談。即作萬分僥倖之觀察。列强能不戰而壓迫日本以東北各地還中國。而中國收復東北後。亦不能免於危險。四十年來。中國於東北之地。亦曾兩失兩得。一八九五年失於日。藉德法俄三國之力而歸還。一九○三年失於俄藉日俄戰爭之結果而收回。此兩失兩得之中。即種下東北問題之病根。以有今日之東北事件。吾人認定。中國對於東北事件。如欲得滿意之解决。必須準備應有之力。不特須藉此力以與日本决勝。並須以此力以求將來之自立。</p>

<p>用其力矣。然全部之力。用於督促政府者幾何。用於國内問題者幾何。而直接用之於應付國難者尙有幾何。用於督促政府之力。一年來之事實。巳證明其爲浪費。國人責政府抵抗。政府以口頭之長期抵抗答之。實際則日軍之威脅行動。巳由東省進展至平津。去年九月間上海市黨部電中。有「」縱云力求退讓。亦必有退讓之限度。縱云願聽宰割。亦宜自擇宰割之方法。」國人於今日讀之。不必傷感。不必失望。吾重述此語。</p>
<p>只以促國人節省其浪費之力。以直接用於應付對日事件耳。非欲使人於前事徒有所慨嘆也。用於國内問題之力。觀於國難會議之使人失望。可以失其爲浪費。初聞國難會議之名。而分用其對日之力量於此方面者。今日莫不嗒然若喪。此亦國人應有之敎訓。蓋重大之外患臨於面前。而猶分其力於國内問題緩急之權衡。殊未免失當也。吾深信集中中國人之力。終不難應付對日之國難。今日所需要者。此力之集中。此力之善用。不使有無益之銷耗無謂之浪費耳。</p>
<p>國人之最善用其力者。一爲東北義勇軍之對日作戰。一爲上海戰爭時十九路軍與東南民衆之合作抗敵。東北義勇軍以中國人民之集合。攻擊佔據中國領土之敵人。再接再厲。不稍示弱。憑恃愛國之血性。以身命之犧牲。爲中華民族表示不甘屈辱。十九路軍與東南民衆。合力以抗日人之武力侵凌。軍隊則冒死奮鬥。民衆則裹糧景從。三十四天之血戰。使日人破膽國際震驚此皆能於國難期中。盡一分之力。得一分之用。以一部分人之奮鬭。收一部分之功效。惟能眞正覺悟自身之力之有用。而又善用之者乃能如此。　　東北義勇軍與十九路軍爲對敵人之侵犯作實戰者。德人磐哈提將軍之戰爭哲學。謂國家被侵。凡屬國民。皆有對敵作戰之義務。惟其作戰。有實戰與虚戰之分。挾軍械以臨前敵者爲實戰。在後方能與敵人以損害者爲虚戰。實戰以攻退敵軍爲目的。其司令爲一軍之將領。虚戰以使敵人得其應有之損害爲目的。其司令爲國民之愛國心。今者國難週年紀念日來臨於吾後方國民之前。吾國民而眞正覺悟者。應速準備其力。培養其力。培養其力迫於必須與敵人作實戰時。則發揮此力。與敵人見於疆塲。不能與敵人作實戰時。則以盤哈提之所謂虚戰。盡吾國民應盡之責任。此國難週年紀念日。已向吾後方國民下總動員之準備令矣。</p>

<p>最後。所可與國人共同紀念者。爲去年瀋變驚耗傳來時。本報警告國人之數語。「………日入此次暴行。實爲我國家之生死關頭。東北半壁山河。今巳淪入日人鐡蹄蹂躪之下。國人愼勿誤認日人之暴行。純爲對美國與蘇俄挑戰。而忘自身處境之危迫。實則日人所爭者我東北也。所蹂躪者我東北也。鐡蹄到處。山河易色。其大陸政策實現之日。即我民族滅亡之時。國難當前。存亡所繫。有血氣之國民。應急起共謀所以自救。「在一年以後重述此數語。雖覺與事件擴大之情形不相稱。而用以共相警策。或尙有相當之意義也。</p>

<p>一八重大之剌激。與此一年中紀不勝紀之創痛。在我民族一若毫無反應。國難之如何挽救。尙原封未動。此則最足令吾人悲痛而莫能自己者也。</p>
<p>黑流嗚咽。白山黯淡。吾人遙望東北破碎之山河。去年九一八之悲慘景象。誠不堪廻溯。然而亦豈能一刻忘乎。吾人今試將此一筆血賬從頭默念。</p>
<p>去年九一八晚。日軍突然實力發動。攻佔我瀋陽空前之慘變。遂於此發端。瀋陽旣佔領。旋即分途襲取沿南滿路各重要都市。長春安東營口等處。一夕之間。遂全落於日人之掌握。二十一日再襲取吉林省城。更西越鄭家屯而至通遼。不及一週。日軍即巳。佔領我遼吉兩省之大半。十月底日軍又進攻齊齊哈爾。雖我馬占山所部奮死抵抗。但至十一月十八日。齊齊哈爾又被攻陷。十二月日軍又大舉西攻錦州。今年一月二日。錦州終以我東北當局之主張不抵抗而陷落。旋又派遣大軍進攻哈爾濱。二月五日哈埠又被佔領。東北半壁山河。至此遂全部淪爲日人所刦持。</p>
<p>日旣佔據東北。遂開始實行其第二步計劃。重演其滅亡韓國之舊劇。去年十二月在日軍指揮之下。瀋陽即已成立所謂新省府。後又在吉林與齊齊哈爾建立與遼寗類似之傀儡政權。所謂地方獨立運動。旣已進行成功。新國建立之呼聲即應時而起。去年十一月天津事變中。日人即乘機挾溥儀走。預定爲傀儡政權之首腦。今年一月十五日。所謂建國會議。公然開幕。在此次會議中。確定僞政權建立之日期。二月十八日新成立之東北行政委員會發表宣言。宣佈滿洲及内蒙之獨立。三月一日所謂滿洲僞國正式宣告成立。九月傀儡溥儀在長春就傀儡職。十一日公佈所謂僞憲法。於是此一幕醜惡之傀儡劇。乃於以大功告成。到本月十五日。日本又進一步悍然不顧一切。正式承認僞國。夫傀儡組織旣爲日人所一手造成。自造之而自承認之。當然爲其勢所必至。</p>
<p>然而日人所加諸吾人之暴行。猶不僅東北之佔領。與傀儡僞國之一手粗成而巳。去冬。福州靑島以及沿海各地。日人亦曾一再搗亂。故意挑蠶。十一月十日。又造成天津事變。旋迫我河北省府主席王樹常。訂立屈辱之條件。至今年一月二十八日之上海禍變。所予吾人之慘痛印象。尤爲深切。上海戰禍亘一月又四日。在日軍飛機大砲轟擊之下。至今閘北吳淞江灣等處。均尙僅餘瓦礫一片。至於我人民之橫遭屠戮。尤不可勝計。此一筆血賬。此重疊鞭痕之種種創痛。而謂吾人能忘之乎。而謂吾人忍忘之乎。</p>
<p>不忘則如何曰。惟有自奮自强。以自力謀自助自救。</p>
<p>我國過去一年最大之失策。即爲不肯以自力抗暴自衛。而徒呼靈於國聯。　　此種政策。直至最近似猶未肯抛棄。此次日承認僞國。仍僅援引九國公約。照例發一次空言無力之抗議。實則國際聯盟與九國公約之毫無能力。極爲明顯。决不能應我緩急。今日就國際情勢觀察。與日衝突有日益尖銳化之勢者爲美。日佔東北。與美所持之門戶開放機會均等之原則適相衝突。實予美以絶大之剌激。故美史汀生兩次發言。均對於日本作明顯之指摘。然而美日衝突之所以尙未立即爆發者。一則以英法戰債之關係。不愜於美國。而日又以退出國聯相要脅。英法不願日本退出國聯。故美在外交上處於孤立地位。而不敦貿然有所舉動。再則以日佔我東北。進攻蘇聯。亦爲其主要作用之一。而此作用。又爲列强所默認。以此二因。故美日矛盾雖日益擴大。而其最後之衝突。則爲時尙早。吾人處於此種國際情勢之下。呼籲國聯旣已失望。呼籲九國公約。又寗能有成。而且我國今後之問題。已不僅爲一簡單之東北問題。而爲在兩種意義下之第二次世界大戰局勢中應付之困難。我國究將何以自處。國際形勢瀕於最後轉變之際。一切悲慘之現象。即將次第展開。我國如不急起準備。發憤自强。則豈僅東北問題永永無法解决。而在未來之世界大戰中。更將何以自存乎。</p>
<p>一年容易。我國内今日之一切。與一年以前旣毫無二式。長此以往。則明年今日。吾人或且欲如今日之徒作消極之紀念而亦不可得。來日大難。我人如不自甘滅亡。則臥薪嘗膽。發憤自雄。請自今日始。</p>

<p>（二）成立之經過　滬戰旣罷、國人於劇痛之餘、乃思爲亡羊補牢之計、旣感我國防空之薄弱、復悉政府能力之未逮、奮起直追、端賴民衆、惟民衆力量、散佈四方、不組織則力量不厚、不團結則收效不偉、故成立機關、以資提倡指導、實爲必要、四月間·朱子橋·熊希齡·許世英·陳廉伯·林康侯·殷芝齡諸先生·曁社會上各界領袖·乃會同飛行家翁照垣旅長、共同發起斯會、一時各界聞風興起、熱烈贊同、遂於六月二十八日在上海八仙橋靑年會開成立大會、到會者有本會發起人及各界代表百餘人、濟濟一堂、共襄大舉、洵稱盛事、斯會始基旣樹、乃設會所於南京路大陸商塲六百十號、並向國民政府交通部呈請備案、即蒙批准、嗣後成績如何、端視吾人努力之程度如何而巳矣、</p>
<p>（三）設立之目標　本會設立之目標如何？曰、亦所以實現「航空救國」之意義面巳、舉凡宣傳航空要義也、訓練航空人材也、發展航空事業也、創辦航空工廠也、皆爲本會所計劃進行悉力以赴者、而均以救國圖强爲最後之目標、今國難顚危、可謂極矣、而國防空虚、實爲啓侮之由、欲談國防、則莫如建設强有力空軍、欲建設空軍、是又必我全國同胞、覺悟奮起、羣獻其人力材力、以爲國用、而底於成、夫建設空軍、輕而易舉、速而易達、其戰鬥力則又駕諸海陸軍之上、自强之策、舍此寗有他道、本會之懸引爲鵠的、良有以也、（四）眼前之槪况　本會自成立以來、對各項工作之進行、不遺餘力、竊維國民雖明瞭航空之重要、而未能痛下實行建設之决心、社會雖注意航空之消息、而未能切感參加學習之興趣、鼓吹喚起、則宣傳尙焉、環顧國内航空界旣乏普通刋物、更鮮系統著作、本會於此、則刋行特刋以事鼓吹、編印叢書、以廣研求、餘則　宣傳會、舉行展覽等等以引興趣、此本會工作之初步也、今日我國航空界最感困難者、爲人材之缺乏、夫製造需材、駕駛亦需材、材不備則物不能致其用、故敎育尙焉、本會於此、則籌備創設航空工程班以培養製造人材、籌備開辦航空學校以訓練飛行人材、（詳見本會初步敎育製造工作計劃草案）規模雖小、成就可期、其餘各項重要工作、亦在次第推行、所望全國同胞、各本救國之誠、來相策勵耳、</p>
<p>（五）歡迎同胞入會　本會旣誕生於國難之中、復標樹救國之的、則凡屬同胞、皆有參加工作之義務、或以身親、或以財助、各盡其能、各竭其有、以助本會之發展、則將來我國成航空之土、我民成航空之族、爲世界光、爲人類福、豈夢想哉、豈夢想哉、</p>

<p>起飛之後、駛駕飛機之助手、卽可首戴耳機、收聽各地消息、以定飛行方針、當天氣淸朗之時、在白晝有陸地種種目標、可以指引航綫、在夜間、則每距十里、必有一航標之燈、以示方向、同時探聽前途各站之氣候、且每隔十餘分鐘、發報一次、藉以報告各站飛行情形、所在地點等等、互通消息、雖人地二隔、猶如促膝談心也、不幸重霧降臨、甚至駛機者、不見其機翼之端、駛機者、早巳探知大霧之將臨而已準備一切、由是而卽可利用無綫電機、聽循各地指問電臺之電音進行、及至目的之地、可得該臺之通知、而安然降落、此無綫電機之有功於飛航、可見一斑矣、茲就美國航空事業而言、全國航綫密佈、猶如蛛網、在一九三一年春之調查、陸地各站、裝有指問之無綫電臺有四十九座、可聽其所發之電音而循其準確之方向航行、且有可供觀察之無綫電指問電臺、二十一座、以應需要、在建築中卜尙有多座也、</p>
<p>適合航空用之無線電機、可分甲乙二種、甲種是裝於飛機上者、乙種乃供機站之用、每種再分爲發報、收報、長波、及短波等、</p>
<p>飛機所用之無線電機、體量皆極輕小、電力約五十瓦特、兼可講話、所發電浪、可自二十米達至五十米達、所製各收報及發報機、皆採用晶體管束其波長之準確、</p>
<p>應用之電源、或給自藉風力發動之發電機、或給自藉蓄電池發動之發電機、一切電線、接合妥善、决無損壞鬆脫諸虞、關於游行之飛機、則採用較長之電浪、自二百米達至四百五十米達、無線電機、裝於飛機上者、皆安置於不碍駛駕之處、而以相當設備、免受震動、而致損壞、且每機備有陸地無線電臺、圖表一紙置於座右、專供飛航通信者以便隨時呼應、設備之完美、運用之便利、大可爲吾國航空建設之參考也、</p>
<p>查歐美諸國、航空事業之發展速率、有一日千里之勢、民衆之信仰、亦日益增高、安全利便、有口皆碑、細察其航行安全之由、雖然機械精良、人才老練、然臻乎此完美之發展情形、無線電機之功用、亦與有功焉、以管見所及、對於航空建設、應極注意於無線電之設備、因航行之安全、及發展之遲速、有重要關係在也、未知讀者諸君、以爲然否、</p>

<p>會銜通告日僑</p>
<p>三日内勿外出</p>
<p>旅滬日僑、原定於今日午後二時、在虹口公園、舉行所謂「侵滿紀念」慶祝大會、惟日軍政當局、鑒於我國民氣激昻、誠恐再度發生擲彈慘案、故曾一再會銜勸告日僑、停止召集、但日僑雖表示接受、然仍擬在其所在各地、分别舉行慶祝、而日海軍司令左近司、及陸戰隊司令杉板、昨均下緊急令、在日僑居住區域施行特别戒嚴、實行檢查行人、同時並力阻日僑外出、茲將各項消息、分誌於後、</p>
<p>施行特别戒嚴　今日爲九一八國難紀念、日駐滬軍政當局、因鑒於我國民氣激昻、於昨日下午三時、緊急通令所屬部隊、施行特别戒嚴、海軍陸戰隊則悉數上陸、在虹口北四川路一帶日僑居住區域、嚴密佈防、巡邏隊人數、則由八人增爲十四人、每半小時出外巡邏一次、同時機槍隊·鐡甲車隊·亦一律奉令出發梭巡、日警團則負保護日商廠號之責、同時對於華人之經過日僑居住區域者、並施行嚴密之檢查、</p>

<p>將完成其滿蒙政策</p>
<p>關外來客談</p>
<p>國聞社云、日帝國主義者、冒天下之大不韙、毁滅世界公認之九國公約、竟於十五日不顧一切、正式宣佈承認其一手造成之滿洲傀儡政府矣、日人以運用亡韓故智、遣派其滅韓統監式之全權特使、甫入東省、即與僞組織簽訂種種亡國條約、此後之東三省、已非我所有、關外之三千萬同胞、則與朝鮮臺灣同爲敵人鐡蹄之亡國奴焉、昨有東省歸來之某君與記者以友誼關係、所談日本承認僞組織後之野心亦甚詳、特錄之藉促國内上下之猛醒也、</p>
<p>完成滿蒙　近數十年來、日本處心積慮、積極進行其滿蒙政策、自東北三省陷入日軍之手後、一面嘛使無恥叛逆漢奸、成立所謂滿洲政府、另一方面則覬觎蒙古甚亟、觀其最近發表荒謬宣言文中、「滿」字下必帶一「蒙」字、故滿蒙政策、現爲日人侵華之唯一工作也、</p>
<p>十月攻熱　日人旣完成其第一步所謂新生命線承認滿洲後、對熱河問題、勢必於最近期内進攻、一則以完成滿蒙、次則可以斷絶關内關外消息、以掩盡天下耳目、據最近形勢觀察、日方定於十月間、舉兵犯熱、以日軍方面度之、定可必得熱河而無問題、</p>
<p>操縱金融　日本自去歲九一八刦奪東北後、操縱金融、不遺餘力、　一方亟將金融事業、如邊業銀行·東三省官銀行·分别復業、另設一僞中央銀行、統一東三省幣制、操縱各行營業、並將三省各行所發紙幣、統由中央銀行收回、另由該行發行紙幣、强制通行三省、以日人計劃、於二年内完全、可將三省金融整理就緖、日人野心操縱東三省之金融亦可見矣、</p>
<p>訓練滿兵　某君謂、日前國内各報載、。</p>
<p>傀儡僞國軍政部整理「滿洲國」軍十三萬人方針、期分三期云云、實有未盡處、蓋現下關外各省各要塞無處非日兵把守、最近有人統計、日軍在滿者八萬以上、而所謂「滿洲國」軍、僅四萬人左右、日前據可靠消息、日决嗾僞軍部招兵三十萬、分二十個師團、所有槍械、除原有整理外、不敷悉由日方供給、訓練期則定二年、此項計劃、可於明春實行、</p>
<p>大舉侵華　二年後、日之在東省金融旣可鞏固、而所謂練就之三十萬滿兵、可作攻我之需矣、其最可爲我人驚駭者、即傀儡溥儀、於此將作進一步之荒唐事業、即宣布其以前遜位之原由與經過、及組織僞國理由、並發表復位言論、此時也、設有任何一方、出而反抗、溥儀乃即舉兵來侵、關内各方、倘無嚴密防範、則中國前途、不堪設想矣云云、</p>

<p>東北失陷，自去年九月十八日，到今年九月十八日，已是一週年了！侵略者人誌慶，被侵略者祗好誌哀：九三相老人對這國恥，是一再有過沉痛的表示！</p>
<p>記得去年全國爲此事變誌哀的前一晚，相老人吩咐我寫一篇敬告國人書：脫稿時，因夜深，相老人囑我立刻送到申報館去。我在夜色蒼茫裏去辦妥了；可是着了凉，得了傷風症；自忖爲國難而患病，是很足以自豪了丨次晨，我仍一早就拿申報特載欄的文字，送給相老人親自閱過：有些認爲很對，有些認爲欠妥。後來他自己提筆寫了幾段文字。我現在抄出來，作爲今年誌哀用。</p>
<p>·······················</p>
<p>「國者，有機體也。國無國防，防無秘密，是無土地也。四民無科學知，（知即知識）生産力，而兵食皆取足於客貨，是無人民。政治不按行政法，（原注Ａdministration）是無政事也。無政事，是無機體，几上肉，非國也。」</p>
<p>「傳曰：修己而不責人，則免於難。又曰“衛國忘亡。衛文公大布之衣，大帛之冠，務材訓農，通商惠工，敬敎勸學，授方任能；元年革車三十乘，季年乃三百乘。國人能法衛文公之道德政治，以一年所吸鴉片紙烟之費，省造兵車，豈但三百乘，雖三萬不難也丨或開兵工廠，以固國防，亦何至年費萬萬金，買外國凶器，以殺同胞，而不之饜耶？」</p>
<p>「嗚呼！舉國昌言無良心無宗敎！乃自徐上海著西法水利，關西王了一著奇器圖說，迄今三百有餘年，政府不能用國貨，造國防，人民不能按科學，造食用所需：至我東鄰五六十年中，凡西鄰所能者，無所不能：宜其忘人道，惟思羿爲愈己！同文同種，聊作笑面虎之說耳，豈可信乎？」</p>
<p>······························</p>
<p>備考：去年相老人發表誌哀文字，我已經編入江蘇國難救濟會印送的馬相伯先生國難言論集中，可函該會索閱。</p>

<p>— 高潛</p>
<p>丨我們將如何默念呢？丨</p>
<p>九月十八到了。血腥的紀念，已滿了一年！國府通令全國黨員與公務人員在上午十一時默念五分鐘誌哀，我們默念的什麽呢！</p>
<p>親愛的讀者，我們在此五分鐘内不要嘆息丨嘆息表示懦弱無能而巳丨我們在此五分鐘内不要流淚，流淚表示屈服而已丨不！我們都不要！我們要在此五分鐘内格外堅强我們的意志！</p>
<p>我們只怪政府不好，有什麽用呢？我們爲什麽不積極的指導政府與政府合作呢？我們這樣自私自利的人民能不能産生理想的政府呢？不要怪人，先從自己來！學生們，工人們，商人們，你們想想如何才能報國呢？怎樣才算對得起國家呢？大家努力吧！從這五分鐘起，大家立定個報國的辦法，努力去做，個人的利害得失，不要計較得太細了，要把國家做前提·國亡了，自私也私不成了政府諸公，我想在此五分鐘也有同心的哀悼！然而徒哀有何益，往事不談，願諸公莫忘此五分鐘，從此大家捐除私人利害以民意國事爲前提，無負於黨，無負於國，同心一德，諸公縱不能立除國難，上亦可對得在天的總理，下亦可對得四萬萬民衆了，</p>
<h3 id="c96">我記着這些話 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 奚鳥</p>
<p>丨深刻在心靈中不滅丨</p>
<p>「九一八」又跳在受了麻醉藥迷的中國民衆之面前，早早就狂呌着的論調：堅决禦侮，矢志復仇……又將絮聒到人們的耳邊。</p>
<p>報紙上一片抵制仇貨的聲浪，看了眞呌敵人膽寒：其實，各商店在全仗大減價過日子的狂風暴雨裏，那一家是眞的能實行呢？</p>
<p>提倡國貨那個高調，現在是聲息全無。大槪國貨的提倡時期，巳經成爲過去的名詞了。諸位！你們買了多少國貨了？</p>
<p>近來看見鈔票上寫着「良心救國不買仇貨」和「將此票付與敵人者男盜女娼」那些文字，我不希望什麽，祗希望那些文字的人，不是祇不過說說寫寫而已的熱血朋友。</p>
<p>曾經聽見「丈夫侍僕」論的得勝朋友說：你們男子祗會空口說白話，事實上一些没有好處，這和我們女子之所以成功，行動上絶對站在相反的地位。」呵丨男士們！記着吧！關於這一切。</p>
<p>小學時代的學生裝束，洋貨可以少見：中學時代的學生裝束，一半兒合奏着中西交戰曲，大學時代的學生裝束，也許洋本書太多讀的緣故，簡實像受了洋裝敎育的全身找不出國貨的片段，誰說救國能力是跟了智識高低而轉移？</p>

<p>— 白石</p>
<p>中國的國恥紀念，正應着王小二過年的那句話，一年勝似一年了。你瞧自古到今有給人注意過的九月十八日，到了今年，忽的又成了一個再新鮮不過的「九一八」國恥紀念了。</p>
<p>「九一八」國恥紀念，是去年今日，日本人藉口南滿路爲人破壞，於是派兵佔據了我遼寗，吉林，黑龍江三省。用偷天換日的手段，牽着浦儀，造成了一個傀儡國，預備將來併呑。</p>
<p>從前的一切國恥紀念，不過是開租界，認賠欵，簽訂辱國條約而已。這一個國恥紀念，却把整塊兒的國土，送給人家做　地，大數兒的人民，送給人家做奴隷。這個恥，眞恥得至矣盡矣。</p>
<p>我希望大家都臥薪嘗膽，誓雪國恥。不要糊糊塗塗的忘了「九一八」。忘了「九一八」只好做「忘八」。</p>

<p>願大家注意着！</p>
<p>「九一八」事件，誠爲吾國民族空前鉅深的國恥！我們對於這一個警心沭目痛澈心脾的悲慘國難，應該怎樣的臥薪嘗胆般困苦自勵的警醒覺悟，發奮爲雄，方能夠上下一心，雪恥救國，洗却睡獅的混號！</p>
<p>今天是「九一八」的悲痛紀念，這一幕驚天動地的慘劇，無論怎樣永遠不能忘却！可是呵，我們今天放眼看看四周的現象，是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>戲院，游戲塲裏，還是急管繁絃穿紅着綠的唱戲。</p>
<p>酒樓·旅社·妓院裏，還是一樣的花天酒地挾妓胡鬧。</p>
<p>跳舞塲裏，還是依舊的樂聲悠揚燈紅酒綠的歌舞。</p>
<p>咖啡店，按摩院，還是樣的嬉戲作樂。</p>
<p>跑狗塲，回力球塲，還是一擲千金的賭博。</p>
<p>總會，俱樂部，公館，商店，還是東西南北中發白的大打麻雀。</p>
<p>公園裏，還是一對一對的挾着愛侶，攝影啦，談情啦，憧憧往來。</p>
<p>這些不知亡國恨的大國民，不知多多少少，要是外寇來時，他們就是亡國先鋒，我們大家注意着吧。</p>

<p>芬若突然地走到窓邊站着，在思想，在考慮，同時眼淚又簌簌地落在襟上，背向着袁團長，兩肩在聳動。</p>
<p>「我應該向你求恕，這十幾年的苦，都是由我给你受的；現在我純潔而且眞誠的靈魂，在推動我的身子，敎我來找你，求你把一切悲傷的心丢開，我們携着手，再走到快樂之門，你不要哭吧！你應該記得我們最後一次分别的時候，我曾向你像挑釁一般地擁抱着你，而且恫嚇一般地向你說：你說着！我一定在某一天，再來擾亂你的心，而且緊緊地擁抱你，使你不能透過氣在你嫁了以後。你是這樣答復我：你以後還是這麽不長進，伴幾個孩子唱些幼穉歌曲，而不會唱大軍進行曲的樣子，我是有力量可以不再給你一些什麽安慰與滿足的。芬若！你這句策勵我的說話，我是始終不曾忘即，在任何一秒鐘的時間，或任何一立方寸的空間，你要是背棄你的前言，我將使我一切的廻憶，撕毁了我光明快樂的希望之幕。」袁團長兩手撫着伊的兩肩，把臉倒向着芬若。</p>
<p>但是芬若還是哭着聳着兩肩，格外的加甚，袁團長似乎也有些詞窮，一時想不出再比眞實而動聽的話了。於是室中靜了三分鐘，袁團長在室中走來走去，兩手不住地抓着頭，在苦悶得没有辦法解决。</p>
<p>這時芬若突然地回過身來，迎上袁團長面前去說：「袁團長，請你恕我，我已再三考慮過了，我以前的舉動是這樣不好，我不能看透了你待我的眞情，我已十分後悔，現在我不能再把不幸的靈魂來侮辱你，這是我的一片苦心，請你明白我的環境；但是你的眞摯熱愛，我已說不出的感激，請你保重的身子，寳貴你的身份與名譽，發皇你將來的事業！我現在發一個願，犧牲我一個人，去找你以前所遺棄的夫人，雖然我不曾見過伊是怎樣的面龐，多高的身材，我料想伊愛你的親愛，還是没有衰退，假使伊是還活在世上，而没有死掉。請你把伊愛着，和愛我一樣；你只要想到自己失戀的痛苦，去代替你的妻子想一想，一定會再可憐伊，愛戀伊。這十幾年裏，我己過慣了單調的生活，至多再度這麽十幾年，也就把我一生的歷史結束了，但是你的事業，還正在開始我們的國家，决不容許一個英雄，再沈溺到女人熱愛的陷阱中去，你如果是眞的愛我，你應該瞭解我這幾句話！我的丈夫，雖然是一個軍人，但是他的思想與體魄，眞實的還不配當一個軍人，雖然他己死了十幾年，但是我還得有批評他的權利，因爲他是不肯聽我的話，抛棄他躭樂的生活。袁團長！我將永遠和你做一個和朋友，永遠不會把你的身影與心神，抛棄在我的腦外，在任何時間。」</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>舉辦民衆圖書館之需要，巳具論如前，茲所言者，是爲具體辦法矣，鄙見：舉辦此種社會事業，不用去仰賴政府當局，因爲事實告訴過我們，凡事到了咱們貴國政府的掌握中，便要弄得糟不堪言，所以這種輕而易舉的事，還不如我們民衆自動來幹，由一二有興趣而又熱心的人發起，醵措一筆欵子，（籌得一百元，便可舉辦一館，）爲着不花開支起見，最好館址便附設在私人家裏，以早晚的空餘時間，輪流管理這樁事，一般受了經濟壓迫以致無法上學而又須忙於生活的民衆，也正可趁此晰夕之暇，來借書閱讀，規則務須嚴明，借書數</p>
<p>證金一元，年終付還，來年再繳，其後每次借書，酌收銅元一枚或二枚，積下的證金利息及經常收入的銅元，專作添購圖書之用，憑着良心，公　　目、以昭信於社會，</p>
<p>關於置備圖書的質的問題，我覺得城市與鄉村，不能盡同，原因是：（一）城市與鄉村的生活方式不同，（二）因此民衆對於圖書的需要與興趣亦各異；但亦不可偏激過甚，宜在適應彼此環境之下，力謀城市與鄉村的生活之匯合，溶洽，程度方面；城市的，可以稍高，以初中一年級程度起碼：鄉村的，應稍降低，其根本條件：文字要深入淺出，理要簡明，使讀者易於索解：故鑑定備置圖書者，不但要學問高深，而且還要悉心考慮，可不要隨便了事，現在我且把圖書類目開列於後。</p>
<p>城市民衆圖書館的：</p>
<p>（一）醫藥衛生書丨城市居民甚多，空氣汚濁，社會複雜，所以這類書籍，非常重要。</p>
<p>（二）工商業叢書丨以備一般店員工友之需要。</p>
<p>（三）民族思想叢書丨輸入民族思想，反抗帝國主義之壓迫。</p>
<p>（四）揭穿當局黑幕一類的書丨使衆皆利害曉然，不去盲從，如只顧内戰，不抵抗帝國主義的侵略。</p>
<p>（五）文藝書籍丨賴以陶養德性，舒</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>精神。</p>
<p>鄉村民衆圖書館的：</p>
<p>（一）破除迷信一類的書丨鄉間迷信盛行，阻碍社會進化，故應多備此類書籍。</p>
<p>（二）農業叢書丨中國農業上的各種方法，都是幾千年以前的，亟應灌輸新法智識。</p>
<p>（三四）（與城市的心。）</p>
<p>（五）初步工業書丨藉使一般手工業改良。</p>
<p>（六）農民文學書丨務須淺顯，富有剌激性者爲佳，使得鄉人也受點智識方面的精神安慰。</p>
<p>此種辦法，祗要有三數人首爲之倡，而又成績佳勝，自不難普遍各地，鄙人年底回鄉，將擬舉辦，蠡見如此，未敢云當，還祈熱心的諸位會員先生共同討論。</p>

<p>— 江天覽</p>
<p>甲　鐡線上鍍金法</p>
<p>鐡線上鍍金鍍銀，旣極美觀，法亦甚易，祇須將鐡線浸在淡硫强水内，再置在濃硝强水中，蝕去鐡線上的銹，但硝强水中須加烟矣少許，俟鐡銹蝕盡後，用石灰水洗過，再濯以淸水，一端繫一塊鉛片，然後浸入銅水，鍍銅一層，即以淸水洗滌，如欲將其鍍金，則納金水中，鍍銀則納銀水中，鍍成後，放在熱木屑裏面，促其速乾，</p>
<p>（一）銅水製法　鈉養三十六分　鉀葡酸三十分　膽礬七分　雨水二百分</p>
<p>（二）金水製法　金綠十分　鉀衰一百五十分　共化於雨水五百分内　另以養鉀三十分　鈉養燐養五五十分溶於雨水五百分内　互相和匀而成</p>
<p>（三）銀水製法　銀養淡養五一百分　鉀衰三百五十分　雨水千分</p>
<p>乙　銅器上鍍金法</p>
<p>不拘黃銅紅銅，用以鍍金，非常淺顯，法以眞金三錢，溶化在合强水中，變成一種金綠，加下蒸溜水二升，鉀養：炭養：一磅，沸煑兩小時，於是將銅製的器皿飾物，洗滌乾凈，浸入液中，至多一分鐘的工夫，即成金色燦爛的物品了　　丙　玻璃上鍍金法</p>
<p>鍍金玻璃，確爲現代裝飾名貴品，其法甚簡，只要用三種液，爲甲液二十分，乙液五十分，丙液五分，互相調和，先用鹼水洗凈玻璃，將液塗敷，少頃金色附着於上，日久不會剝落，</p>
<p>（一）甲液製法　金綠二十分　蒸溜水一百五十分</p>
<p>（二）乙液製法　無水鈉養輕養五十分　蒸溜水二十分</p>
<p>（三）丙液製法　酒精二十分　純阿勒第海特二十分　葡萄糖二分半　蒸溜水三十分</p>

<p>— 陸鳳沼</p>
<p>本市租房，多半是向二房東轉租，二房東爲着生利起見，把房子東改西搭，妨害公衆衛生，且租價又隨意需索，高低不一，應予設法改良，以維平民生活案「理由」上海除去一般資産階級，自已有住宅，或租住整幢的洋房外，其餘的一般普通平民，多半四五家合住着一幢衖堂房子，由一家做二房東的總其成，</p>
<p>二房東是把這一幢房子，整個的租下來，除去自己需要的外，其餘分租給别人家，這原是一種合作性質，法良意美，</p>
<p>但是現在的二房東，（這是指一般的並非上海的二房東個個如此）門檻愈弄愈精，他把一幢房子，東改西搭，不管衛生不衛生，只要間數多，能多租出房錢就是了，所以這般做二房東的，非但白住了房子，還可以賺錢，靠着做二房東維持生活，生財有道，深堪佩服，　　可是因着二房東要賺錢，就做了三房客，拚命的增加房租同是一間房子，有的二房東只要十塊錢，有的確定十五塊錢，三房客爲着自己没有做二房東的能力，就勉强的忍受，碰到了内地有不測的事情，他們就趁火打刦利市三倍，言之痛心，</p>
<p>本會裏的會員，諒來做二房東和三房客的，各有其人，所以本席提出這個問題來，請大家討論，如何辦法，可以制止這般刁蛋的二房東，這是本席唯一的希望，</p>
<p>附意見</p>
<p>（一）鄙意每一條里或坊，應由大房東，依照整幢的租價，加以捕捐費水費電費等並酌留空房錢部份，規定價格，二房東三房客均須遵守，如隨意增加，即取消其做二房東資格，</p>
<p>（二）對於里或坊内之住幢房子，警務當局，應嚴密注意其改搭，以免其有碍衛生，和公衆安寗，</p>
<p>上述兩項是否有當謹請公决</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>前天，我和四個朋友，上飯館去吃飯，朋友中有某甲，因爲喜歡吃「韭菜炒肉絲，」於是飯菜中多點了這一樣丨「韭菜炒肉絲。」</p>
<p>同時，某甲忽發奇問題：「人家說「韭菜」這樣東西，是葷的，什麽道理？」</p>
<p>某乙繼着說道：「還有「葱」和「蒜，」也說是葷的，眞不知道是什麽道理？」</p>
<p>素喜滑稽的某丙笑道：「這也許是耶穌自有道理。」</p>
<p>自問知道的某丁解釋道：「這是臭味的道理，因爲「韭菜」「葱」「蒜，」都有臭味的。」</p>
<p>喜歡吃「韭菜」的某甲，聽了某丁這般解釋，認爲理由不充足，於是不服道：「那麽，「臭豆腐乾，」爲什麽是素的呢？」</p>
<p>素喜滑稽的某丙道：「眞的，如果「韭菜」「葱」「蒜，」說是葷的，那麽，「米」「麥」也可說是葷的了，吃素人豈不要餓死了嗎？」某乙道：「吃素的還不是騙人丨往往有些壞事，偏偏是吃素人做的！」某丁時方吃完了飯，聽了某乙這般說，把碗筷一擱道：「這敎做「若要黑心人，吃素淘裏尋！」」</p>
<p>我見他們你一句，我一句，說的有趣，再加聽了某乙和某丁的感慨話，於是也參加了發言道：</p>
<p>「大槪這些吃素的，原是「黑心人，」「？」因爲吃了素，可以减輕罪孽吧？最奇的我覺得有種「燒香老婆，」一到了廟裏，遇見了她們的同道，談起天來，總是談的是自己媳婦的壞話，每有一面喧着佛號，一面講着自己的媳婦怎樣不好，這眞是豈有此理丨」</p>
<p>我講到了這裏時，大家巳吃完了飯。　　某甲端了一杯茶，剛要和茶杯接吻，聽我道着一般「燒香老太婆」的壞處，於是重把那杯茶，向旧要一放道：「沈君的話，着啊！我們家鄉，有兩句俗話，敎做「進門講媳婦，出門講油豆腐，」意思就是說她們進了廟門，講媳婦的壞話。出了廟門，講這家廟裏的油豆腐，燒的怎樣好吃！」</p>
<p>某甲講罷，滑稽的某丙，繼着吟了一聲「阿彌陀佛！」大家聽了，付之一笑。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Coming of the National Humiliation Memorial Day <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Last year today, the Japanese army brigade invaded and attacked Shenyang City (all vehicles were our country's).</p>
<p>Last year on this night, the Japanese army on the South Manchuria Railway suddenly fired a cannon at the Beida Camp in Shenyang, opening the situation of the Northeast Incident. Our unprecedented national disaster began here. Time has passed, and today, the scope of the incident is expanding day by day, and the nature of the incident is becoming more and more serious. And the anniversary of our national disaster is coming in a hurry. Under the sadly lowered half-mast, the people of the country recall the humiliating and painful history of the past year, and look forward to the crisis that will continue to strike. If they have blood, they should not forget their national hatred. If they have a heart, they should not abandon their responsibilities. With the coming of this national humiliation anniversary, there must be some gatherings and commemorations in our country as a temporary embellishment, and some people will silently express their grief as a routine action. However, this kind of commemoration fails to fully realize its great significance for the commemoration of national disaster. The great significance of this memorial day lies in promoting the true awakening of the 470 million people who are in the midst of national disaster.</p>
<p>What the people of the country must first realize is that in the future, any principles of international law, any clauses of international conventions, and any resolutions of international organizations are not to be relied upon in resolving the Sino-Japanese issue. The Japanese themselves call their atrocities "the launch of force." Their attitude of only valuing power is clearly visible. Our country still wants to resolve this extremely large dispute by peaceful means today. The history of the past year has clearly reported to us that it is impossible. The Council of the League of Nations initially wanted to persuade the Japanese to stop through advice. During the second meeting between China and Japan in October last year, they realized that they were "encountering a difficult situation." If the Japanese were truly afraid of the principles of international law, the September 18th Incident would never have been launched. If the Japanese were truly afraid of international conventions, they would have stopped when the League of Nations cited the Covenant and the United States announced its adherence to the Nine-Power Treaty. Their declaration that the Nine-Power Treaty did not apply and needed to be amended already showed their contempt for such conventions. If the Japanese were truly afraid of the resolutions of international organizations, they would never have had the I</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Army Firing at Our Compatriots on the Streets of the City After Occupying Shenyang <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>They would not have dared to oppose thirteen votes with one vote in October last year, nor would they have regarded the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly in March as a mere formality. The Chinese diplomatic authorities, in the official document issued the day before yesterday regarding the Japanese recognition of the puppet organization, condemned Japan for violating international laws and regulations and resolutions, and requested the signatories and interested parties of the Nine-Power Treaty to pay attention to the Japanese behavior, and ordered Yan Huiqing to report to the League of Nations. This is just a necessary procedure in diplomacy. It goes without saying that it is invalid. We believe that the Sino-Japanese issue in the future is entirely a matter of power. International laws and regulations have long become useless objects. Secondly, the people of the country should be aware of the danger of relying on external forces. Due to the wait-and-see attitude of the powers, the international sanctions force has failed to exert its influence, causing the Japanese to act recklessly and do whatever they want. This is a deep disappointment to the people of the country regarding the failure of international justice. However, there is still a long way to go. The provocative behavior of the Japanese may not be able to stimulate the reaction of other powerful countries, which may lead to a second world war. At the very least, the previous events of the three countries forcing the return of Liaoning may be seen again. However, after the launch of international force, if China does not have corresponding strength to deal with it, the future crisis is also to be feared. The power required to participate in the war will not be discussed for the time being. Even if we observe with all kinds of luck, the powers can force Japan to return the Northeast to China without a war, but China cannot avoid danger after recovering the Northeast. In the past forty years, China has also lost and regained the Northeast twice. It was lost to Japan in 1895 and returned with the help of Germany, France, and Russia. It was lost to Russia in 1903 and recovered as a result of the Russo-Japanese War. In these two losses and gains, the root of the Northeast issue was planted, leading to today's Northeast Incident. We believe that if China wants to achieve a satisfactory resolution to the Northeast Incident, it must prepare the necessary strength, not only to use this strength to defeat Japan, but also to use this strength to seek future independence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the people of the country should be aware of the usefulness of their own strength and not waste it any more. In the past year, the people of the country have also greatly I</p>

<p>They have used their strength. However, how much of the total strength is used to urge the government, how much is used for domestic issues, and how much is directly used to deal with the national disaster? The facts of the past year have proved that the strength used to urge the government is a waste. The people of the country accused the government of resisting, and the government responded with a long-term verbal resistance. In reality, the Japanese army's threatening actions have progressed from the eastern provinces to Pingjin. In September last year, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department sent a telegram saying, "Even if we strive for concession, there must be a limit to concession. Even if we are willing to be slaughtered, we should choose our own method of slaughter." When the people of the country read this today, they should not be sentimental or disappointed. We repeat these words,</p>
<p>Only to urge the people of the country to save their wasted strength and directly use it to deal with the Japanese incident. It is not to make people sigh in vain about the past. Regarding the strength used for domestic issues, it can be lost as a waste by observing the disappointment of the National Crisis Conference. Those who initially heard the name of the National Crisis Conference and diverted their strength against Japan to this aspect are now all lost. This is also a lesson that the people of the country should learn. When a major external trouble is facing us, it is inappropriate to divide our strength into domestic issues and weigh the urgency. We firmly believe that concentrating the strength of the Chinese people will not be difficult to deal with the national disaster against Japan. What is needed today is the concentration of this strength, the good use of this strength, and not to have useless consumption and meaningless waste.</p>
<p>The best use of their strength by the people of the country is the Northeast Volunteer Army's war against Japan and the cooperation between the 19th Route Army and the people of Southeast China in resisting the enemy during the Shanghai War. The Northeast Volunteer Army, as an assembly of the Chinese people, attacked the enemy who occupied Chinese territory, persevered and did not show weakness. Relying on the blood of patriotism and sacrificing their lives, they showed the Chinese nation that they were unwilling to be humiliated. The 19th Route Army and the people of Southeast China joined forces to resist the Japanese military aggression. The army fought to the death, and the people followed with food and supplies. The thirty-four days of bloody battle made the Japanese frightened and the international community shocked. All of these were able to do their part in the national crisis and get a share of their use. Only those who can truly realize the usefulness of their own strength and use it well can do this. The Northeast Volunteer Army and the 19th Route Army are those who actually fought against the enemy's invasion. The German General Panhatti's philosophy of war states that when a country is invaded, all citizens have the obligation to fight against the enemy. However, their battles are divided into actual battles and virtual battles. Those who carry military equipment to the front line are actual battles. Those who can harm the enemy in the rear are virtual battles. The purpose of actual battles is to attack and repel the enemy army. Its commander is the general of an army. The purpose of virtual battles is to make the enemy suffer the damage they deserve. Its commander is the patriotism of the people. Now that the anniversary of the national disaster is coming to the people in our rear, the people who are truly aware should quickly prepare their strength and cultivate their strength. When they are forced to fight an actual battle with the enemy, they will exert this strength and meet the enemy on the battlefield. When they cannot fight an actual battle with the enemy, they will use Panhatti's so-called virtual battle to fulfill the responsibilities that our people should fulfill. This anniversary of the national disaster has issued a general mobilization preparation order to our people in the rear.</p>

<p>Finally, what we can commemorate together with the people of the country is the few words that this newspaper warned the people of the country when the shocking news of the Shenyang Incident came last year. "...The Japanese invasion is indeed a matter of life and death for our country. Half of the Northeast mountains and rivers have now fallen under the iron hooves of the Japanese. The people of the country must not mistakenly believe that the Japanese atrocities are purely a challenge to the United States and Soviet Russia, and forget the danger of their own situation. In fact, what the Japanese are fighting for is our Northeast. What they are trampling on is our Northeast. Wherever the iron hooves go, the mountains and rivers change color. The day when their continental policy is realized is the day when our nation perishes. When the national crisis is at hand and survival is at stake, the people with blood should rise up urgently and jointly plan how to save themselves." Repeating these few words a year later, although it feels disproportionate to the expansion of the incident, it may still have considerable significance for mutual warning.</p>
<h3 id="e7">A Message to the Nation from the Central Executive Committee on September 18th <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>May all countrymen seek a path to survival amidst deadly peril</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang issued a message to the nation on September 18th of the 21st year [of the Republic]: The three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have fallen for a year now. All countrymen are heartbroken and vow to live and die together. Our party, facing this time of national crisis, bears the weight of the nation. We do not wish to be guilty of national destruction, nor abandon the legacy of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, nor forsake the principles of justice and national strength to defend this territory and preserve this sovereignty. Aside from heeding public opinion, concentrating national strength, and engaging in a heart-wrenching struggle with the violent aggressors, there is no other path. A nation can only survive through its own efforts, not by relying on others. To rise up in indignation and use treaty obligations to sanction the treaty-breaking and unreasonable violence of Japan is the duty of the League of Nations, and requires no appeal from China. At a time when the international environment is undergoing drastic changes, to calmly await the resolution and actions of the League of Nations is also the proper course for China. This differs from merely wringing one's hands and crying out in despair. Therefore, in this matter, we will reason if there is reason to be had, and fight if there is no reason to be had. If our strength is exhausted, we would rather be shattered like jade than survive like a broken tile. This is the determination of our party, which we dare to declare to the nation and swear before Heaven. A nation cannot resist external aggression until its internal troubles are eliminated. In the Battle of Shanghai, the central government mobilized troops and issued urgent orders, but in the end, the aid was delayed due to the constraint of the Red bandits. Having learned from this past experience in Jiangxi, we are now even more wary. Therefore, we have decided to launch a major campaign to suppress the bandits. The people can see the government's active suppression of the bandits and deeply understand its determination to resist foreign aggression. Now, we can foresee that the flames of banditry will gradually be extinguished. This news should be understood by those who see the overall picture and should be clear to patriotic compatriots. A nation cannot overcome great difficulties without the government and the people being close, loving each other, helping each other, and defending each other. It is undeniable that the Chinese people today have different political views and diverse political groups. This is like the arms and fingers having different lengths, and like tastes differing between salty and sour. However, even with different lengths, in the face of danger, they will all help each other to seek self-preservation. Even with different tastes, when facing hunger and thirst, they will put aside their preferences and seek survival first. The current state of the nation is like a lone boat on a vast sea, battered by repeated storms. The boatmen have no time to do anything but cooperate to overcome the difficulties together. How can they bear to sacrifice the safety of the whole for their own selfish interests? Therefore, our party is willing to endure everything today in order to seek the survival of the nation, and hopes that our compatriots will give us their full sympathy and cooperation. A nation cannot achieve lasting survival without long-term plans and preparations. The future of events is unpredictable, but it can be said with certainty that they will become more and more serious and involve more countries. It is like a volcano that has shown signs of activity, and its eruption is a natural consequence. The survival of the nation depends on whether our people, in the face of the coming international turmoil, have the spirit and effort to resolutely extricate ourselves and stand tall. As long as we have a breath of life, we must make fundamental preparations for national strength, including revitalizing the national spirit, increasing national defense materials, and training knowledge and skills. "To be put to death and then live, to be placed in a land of destruction and then survive." The wise teachings of our ancestors will not deceive us. Our party is willing to advance with all our compatriots, without arrogance or discouragement, to seek a path to survival amidst deadly peril. Alas, the coming disaster is great, and the events are unpredictable. The responsibility of our party from now on is to do our best, to work hard in reality, and to be sincere in everything we do. The reason why we cannot remain silent is because we bear the weight of the nation and must declare our utmost sincerity in living and dying together with the nation. Our voice and tears are intertwined, and our words and hearts are exhausted. May our dear compatriots understand this together. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Guangdong Authorities Pay Attention to Southwest National Defense</p>
<p>Coastal Defense Projects Have Been Completed</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangzhou authorities, in view of Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" and the possibility of new changes occurring in the north and Shanghai due to heightened public sentiment, are paying close attention to national defense in the southwest. Although there has been no troop mobilization in reality, the deployment has been completed. If Guangdong Province encounters a foreign alarm, it can conscript the entire province's army in a short period of time. All important coastal locations have been defended. The artillery positions near Guangzhou have all been supplemented. Chief of Staff Zhou of the Third Army, along with Commander Li of the Humen Fort, went out to inspect and have now returned. It is said that the defense projects of Shantou and coastal towns in Guangdong Province have all been completed. According to Chief of Staff Zhou, new cannons have been installed at the Hukou Fort, and the Hukou defense forces are sufficient to cope with any eventuality. In order to resist aerial attacks, Guangzhou has set up anti-aircraft guns, and the Army Aviation Corps will soon practice night flying, so that it can defend against enemy air raids at night. The Southwest Political Council, at the suggestion of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, passed a proposal to establish the position of Border Defense Commissioner of Guangxi Province, and appointed Li Bingxian (transliteration), a veteran general of Guangxi Province, as the first Border Defense Commissioner. His headquarters will be located in Longzhou. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Our Country's Note</p>
<p>Delivered to the US State Department</p>
<p>The United States Does Not Recognize the Status Quo in Manchuria</p>
<p>Always Cooperating Closely with the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Washington) The Chinese Legation here today delivered to the US State Department the National Government's document accusing Japan of violating the Nine-Power Treaty. The Japanese Embassy is currently carefully examining the reaction to Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo," but has not yet sent the protocol or its attached declaration to the State Department. Embassy officials apparently regard Geneva as the center of major developments in the future, and expect the Lytton Report to be sent to Geneva in late this month and published around October 10th. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) As a matter of courtesy, the document addressed to the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty by the Chinese Legation must await Secretary of State Stimson's personal review before its full text can be published. It is expected to be published tomorrow morning. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials stated today that although Japan has adopted an open-door policy towards Manchuria and "Manchukuo," the United States' opposition to Japan's position will not be relaxed in the slightest. The State Department has no intention of accepting any petitions from the so-called Puyi's "Manchukuo" government. Judging from various indications, the United States is still planning to continue to cooperate with the League of Nations and oppose Japan's occupied position.

<p>Leaves England for Geneva</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Goes to the United States to Negotiate on the Far East Incident</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo Hopes that the Powers Will Not Remain Watchful</p>
<p>(London) Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the former Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, who represented China in Geneva earlier this year to negotiate with the League of Nations on the Three Northeastern Provinces incident, is now going to the United States, probably with a mission from the Chinese government. Dr. Shi left for the United States yesterday, claiming to be on a private tour, but it is heard that after arriving in the United States, he will contact the American people and important diplomats regarding the Far East incident. Dr. Yan Huiqing, the Chinese ambassador to the United States and the Chinese representative to the Council of the League of Nations, has been in London for a week, discussing everything with the current Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo. Ambassador Guo will also go to Geneva to attend the next session of the League of Nations. Dr. Yan left for Geneva this morning, and Ambassador Guo is scheduled to depart on September 20th. Gu Weijun, the newly appointed Chinese ambassador to France, is also coming to Europe by Italian ship. Ambassador Guo told a Reuters reporter today that he did not want to criticize Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo," but said that Japan's position was like a man who, after kidnapping a woman, had no choice but to help her perform a ridiculous wedding ceremony. Guo mentioned the Lytton Report, saying that he did not know the content of the report, but he guessed that the report would confirm the generally known facts and determine that Japan was an aggressor. If the countries concerned still adopt a wait-and-see policy in Geneva, it will only increase the seriousness of the situation. What is needed now is firm and active action. There is a close relationship between the situation in the Three Northeastern Provinces and the disarmament conference. Without security, how can disarmament be achieved? (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ito Shuji, Deputy Director of the Japanese Delegation to the League of Nations, left Tokyo for Geneva at 6:30 p.m. yesterday. Ito said in the train that the League of Nations General Assembly seemed to be scheduled to open in mid-November, but the regular General Assembly opening on the 26th of this month would also discuss the Manchuria issue. I am scheduled to arrive in Geneva on October 2nd and can attend the General Assembly. Our goal is not to argue in the General Assembly or the Council. Since Japan has recognized "Manchukuo," it is most necessary to have the League of Nations recognize Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" based on this fact. Japan's diplomatic means towards the League of Nations have always been aimed at the major powers. In the future, it is also necessary to thoroughly understand Japan's position in the small countries. (Japan News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>US Senator Reed</p>
<p>Goes to Europe to Persuade Britain and France</p>
<p>Will Exert Pressure on Both China and Japan</p>
<p>To Ensure that the Far East Situation Does Not Expand Further</p>
<p>(Paris) US Senator Reed arrived here from London at 11 p.m. tonight and will consult with Herriot on the situation of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Reed previously represented the United States in negotiations with Japan at the London Naval Conference. He is especially familiar with the affairs of the Pacific region and Japan's attitude towards several important events. Diplomatic circles now believe that Reed will advise France and Britain to put pressure on both China and Japan to avoid all actions and to compel the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to consult before the League of Nations reconvenes to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute.

<p>Maintaining the Legal Status for Our Country</p>
<p>(New York) According to the New York Times Washington correspondent, the US government is now planning to indefinitely retain the US consuls stationed in the Three Eastern Provinces and deal with "Manchukuo" informally when it comes into contact with it. The correspondent also stated that the legal status of the consuls towards China will remain unchanged as usual. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>After Japan Recognizes the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>A Glimpse of International Public Opinion</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Star published an opinion today, saying that the US attitude has been made clear, so the US authorities are now only waiting for all developments to unfold and do not want to hasten their appearance. The Washington Post said that the construction of the puppet government is a farce outside Japan's borders. The New York Evening Post criticized this matter in a mocking tone. The New York World Telegram said that Japan has actually violated the Nine-Power Treaty. The newspaper believes that the European powers have supported Japan's actions, or at least acquiesced to them. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian wrote an article on Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo," regarding Manchukuo as being created single-handedly by Japan. The newspaper explained its dissatisfaction with Japan one by one, and then said that the League of Nations and the powers were standing by and doing nothing about Japan's actions, and that the particularly serious impact was that international organizations did nothing about the Far East issue, which would greatly reduce the authority of the organization. Japan's actions are enough to make us fear the Pacific problem again, not to mention that certain influences are more than this. "Since the Sino-Japanese incident, Europeans have gathered their sights on the League of Nations to see whether it can prevent the aggressor country from attacking China. The ultimate goal is to see what spiritual authority the League of Nations has, and what power it can exercise in Europe to protect weak countries and restrain strong countries." The newspaper concluded that, therefore, before the Lytton Report is published, the League of Nations should take action and express its disapproval of Japan and support the United States' resistance, so that Japan can clearly understand that what it should recognize is not "Manchukuo," but the treaty it signed. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German Vossische Zeitung published an editorial entitled "Manchuria, a Vassal State of Japan," saying that the independence of the Three Eastern Provinces has existed since the Japanese created the new government of "Manchukuo" with their military force. The provinces that have seceded from China have now become a country that can demand all kinds of rights from civilized countries in terms of international concepts. Japan's annexation of the Three Eastern Provinces as its vassal state is based on a superior combat position that is bound to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. It can show its skills without harming itself, because in the future, if there is a war, it can be said to be a Sino-Manchurian war. One day, when the Japanese army invades central China, Geneva and Washington will sigh and realize that the treaty they intended to quell the war has a large gap, that is, "Manchukuo" has never ratified this treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" is still being criticized by newspapers. There are occasional opinions that do not oppose this move, such as the Débats. The newspaper said that the establishment of the new state was indeed created by the Japanese, but the Manchus have not failed to have the idea of restoring an independent country and embracing Manchurian nationalism. Although this idea is hidden and not obvious, it has never been extinguished. Furthermore, there should be a distinction between East and West. China's state is not what we call a state. It is hoped that politicians who consider this issue will take into account the factual situation and the diplomatic customs of the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Italian Far East Naval Commander</p>
<p>Visited Chairman Chiang Yesterday</p>

Chen Xizeng, Chief of the Adjutant's Office of the General Headquarters, Chiang Qiyuan, Adjutant, and Pei Fuheng, secretary, were responsible for the reception. They were led to the reception hall. Chiang and his wife, Soong Mei-ling, came out to greet them. After exchanging greetings and taking their seats, Count Barucci first expressed his admiration for Chiang. After a brief chat, Chiang's wife led them to the dining room to have Chinese tea and snacks, and they had a very pleasant conversation. Zabi said that there are about 500 Italian missionaries in central China. Last year, 17 people were kidnapped by the Communists, seven of whom were killed. This year, only one was kidnapped, which proves that Commander-in-Chief Chiang's supervision of the suppression of bandits has been very effective, and the order in central China is becoming more and more stable, and commerce is gradually flourishing. He would like to express his gratitude to Commander-in-Chief Chiang on behalf of the Italian missionaries and merchants, and wish him every success in his final efforts. Chiang replied that the relationship between China and Italy has always been strong, and he hopes that the two countries will cooperate in the future to promote world peace. At about 6:00 p.m., Count Barucci and others then took their leave. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Anniversary of the September 18th Incident <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Today marks the first anniversary of the tragic September 18th Incident in our Northeast. How should we, as a people, spend this anniversary? Has our domestic situation seen any changes in this year? Today, instead of stamping our feet and wringing our hands, pouring out our hearts and minds in passive commemoration, how about calming our minds and silently reflecting on the events of this past year, making a thorough reckoning, and thereby seeking a path forward for our future efforts?</p>
<p>From September 18th of last year to September 18th of this year, this year is truly the most humiliating and unbearable year for our nation. If we speak of "lying on firewood and tasting gall," then this year should be the time for our nation to lie on firewood and taste gall. If we speak of "wiping out shame and striving for strength," then this year should also be the beginning for our nation to rise with determination. However, after a year, the serious situation in diplomacy has not shown any signs of easing, and the state of disunity within our country seems to have worsened. The great stimulus of the September 18th Incident and the countless wounds in this year seem to have no reaction in our nation. How to save the national crisis remains as it was, untouched. This is what makes us the most grieved and helpless.</p>
<p>The Hei River sobs, the Bai Mountains darken. We look out at the shattered mountains and rivers of the Northeast. The tragic scene of the September 18th Incident last year is truly unbearable to recall, but how can we forget it for a moment? Let us now try to silently review this bloody account from the beginning.</p>
<p>On the night of September 18th last year, the Japanese army suddenly launched a forceful attack, occupying our Shenyang, a tragic incident unprecedented. The occupation of Shenyang became the start. After Shenyang was occupied, they immediately attacked important cities along the South Manchurian Railway, such as Changchun, Andong, and Yingkou. Overnight, all fell into the hands of the Japanese. On the 21st, they attacked Jilin City, further west to Zhengjiatun and Tongliao. In less than a week, the Japanese army had already occupied most of our Liaoning and Jilin provinces. At the end of October, the Japanese army attacked Qiqihar again. Although the troops under Ma Zhanshan resisted fiercely, Qiqihar was captured on November 18th. In December, the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on Jinzhou in the west. On January 2nd of this year, Jinzhou finally fell due to the non-resistance policy of our Northeast authorities. Then they sent a large army to attack Harbin. On February 5th, Harbin was also occupied. Half of the Northeast's territory had been completely seized by the Japanese.</p>
<p>After occupying the Northeast, the Japanese began to implement their second step of the plan, repeating their old drama of destroying Korea. Last December, under the command of the Japanese army, the so-called new provincial government was established in Shenyang. Later, puppet regimes similar to those in Liaoning were established in Jilin and Qiqihar. The so-called local independence movement was successfully carried out. The cry for the establishment of a new state arose in response. During the Tianjin Incident last November, the Japanese took the opportunity to kidnap Puyi, planning to make him the head of the puppet regime. On January 15th of this year, the so-called state-building conference officially opened. At this conference, the date for the establishment of the puppet regime was determined. On February 18th, the newly established Northeast Administrative Committee issued a declaration, announcing the independence of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. On March 1st, the so-called puppet state of Manchuria was officially proclaimed. In September, the puppet Puyi assumed the puppet position in Changchun. On the 11th, the so-called puppet constitution was promulgated. Thus, this ugly puppet show was completed. On the 15th of this month, Japan further blatantly disregarded everything and officially recognized the puppet state. Since the puppet organization was created single-handedly by the Japanese, it was naturally inevitable for them to create it and recognize it themselves.</p>
<p>However, the atrocities inflicted on us by the Japanese were not limited to the occupation of the Northeast and the crude creation of the puppet state. Last winter, the Japanese repeatedly caused trouble in Fuzhou, Qingdao, and other coastal areas, deliberately provoking incidents. On November 10th, they created the Tianjin Incident. Then, they forced Wang Shuchang, the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, to sign humiliating conditions. The painful impression given to us by the Shanghai catastrophe of January 28th this year was particularly deep. The war in Shanghai lasted for one month and four days. Under the bombing of Japanese military aircraft and artillery, only ruins and rubble remain in Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, and other places. As for the massacre of our people, it is innumerable. Can we forget this bloody account, these various wounds of repeated whippings? Can we bear to forget them?</p>
<p>If we cannot forget, what should we do? Only strive for self-improvement and strength, seeking self-help and self-salvation through our own efforts.</p>
<p>Our country's biggest mistake in the past year was not being willing to resist violence and defend ourselves with our own strength, but merely appealing to the League of Nations. This policy still seems unwilling to be abandoned until recently. This time, Japan recognized the puppet state, and still only cited the Nine-Power Treaty, issuing a powerless protest as usual. In fact, the lack of capacity of the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty is very obvious, and they definitely cannot respond to our urgent needs. Today, from the perspective of the international situation, the conflict with Japan is becoming increasingly acute with the United States. Japan's occupation of the Northeast directly conflicts with the principle of equal opportunity and open doors held by the United States, giving the United States great stimulation. Therefore, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson made clear accusations against Japan in two speeches. However, the reason why the conflict between the United States and Japan has not erupted immediately is partly because of the issue of war debts between Britain and France, which is unsatisfactory to the United States, and Japan threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations. Britain and France do not want Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations, so the United States is in an isolated position diplomatically and does not dare to take any action rashly. Furthermore, Japan's occupation of our Northeast to attack the Soviet Union is also one of its main functions, and this function is tacitly acknowledged by the great powers. Because of these two reasons, although the contradictions between the United States and Japan are increasing, the final conflict is still early. Under this kind of international situation, appealing to the League of Nations has been disappointing, and appealing to the Nine-Power Treaty will not succeed. Moreover, the problems facing our country in the future are not only a simple Northeast problem, but the difficulty of coping with the situation in the Second World War in two senses. How will our country deal with itself? As the international situation is on the verge of its final transformation, all the tragic phenomena will unfold in order. If our country does not urgently prepare and strive for self-improvement, how can not only the Northeast problem be permanently unresolved, but also how can we survive in the future world war?</p>
<p>A year passes easily. Everything in our country today is no different from a year ago. If this continues, then on this day next year, we may not even be able to make passive commemorations as we do today. A great disaster is coming. If we do not resign ourselves to destruction, then lying on firewood and tasting gall, striving for self-improvement, please begin today.</p>

<p>(Beiping) It is said that Han Fuju's Fulin troops stationed in Weixian had a misunderstanding with Liu Zhennian's troops in Pingdu. The reason, it is said, is that the central government issues 500,000 yuan in military expenses to Shandong Province every month. Liu repeatedly asked Han for a monthly payment of 200,000 yuan. Han agreed to issue 120,000 yuan per month. Liu then sent a representative to visit Han, proposing a compromise plan, issuing 145,000 yuan per month. The provincial government failed to issue the full amount. Several days ago, there were various rumors in Jiaodong. Representatives from all parties have been very busy recently. Liu sent representative Zhang Hexuan to Beiping to visit Ma Hongkui and Zhao Fuchen, and went to Tianjin to visit Yu Xuezhong, asking them to mediate. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>

The reason is due to mutual antagonism over the issue of security zones. It is said that the militia was secretly ordered by Han Fuju to resolve the Liu Zhennian army, which has been taking a neutral attitude. In Pingdu, there are 20 Japanese residents. Japanese officials have negotiated with Han Fuju's army and the local public security bureau regarding the protection of their lives and property. (Telegram from the 17th, Electric News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chinese here have not heard of the rumor spread by the Japanese that Shandong Chairman Han Fuju and Yantai Liu Zhennian's troops have clashed.

<p>Tokyo Students</p>
<p>Celebrating Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>Reuter's [Teletype] Tokyo, 17th – More than 45,000 male and female students from universities, vocational schools, and middle schools in Tokyo gathered in the large open space in front of the Imperial Palace at 1:00 PM today.

<p>Puppet Regime Advocates for Japan</p>
<p>Exposing the Asian Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th – The puppet regime's representative in Japan, Bao Guancheng, gave a speech at a reception hosted by Japanese and Manchukuo officials and the diplomatic corps in Harbin on the 16th. He said that since the World War, the League of Nations has done its best to maintain peace, but we cannot recognize that the League of Nations has complete authority over various disputes, because its foundation is weak. The League of Nations should first implement partial foundational work. After the completion of the three alliances of Europe, America, and the Far East, a world international alliance can be established. The most important of these is the Asian Alliance, and the establishment of Manchukuo is the first step in forming the Asian Alliance.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Demand Reinforcements in the Northeast</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 17th – Japanese residents in the three eastern provinces believe that the area along the South Manchurian Railway is a safe place for Japanese people. Echoing the sentiments of the military, they loudly proclaim invasionism. Since the volunteer army resolved to attack the South Manchurian Railway in August, there has hardly been a moment of safety along the entire line from Niuzhuang, Dashiqiao, Anshan, Liaoyang, Fushun, Andong, to Huangcheng. Countless South Manchurian Railway employees, who used to advocate high-profile rhetoric, have died at the hands of the volunteer army. Furthermore, because the National Salvation Army announced that they would kill Japanese people upon sight, regardless of whether they were women or children, widespread panic has arisen. Moreover, warlords are manipulating the situation in an attempt to regain the right to station troops and to deploy heavy troops in various parts of eastern provinces, creating an atmosphere to induce the military to have an opportunity to send troops. Today, the South Manchurian Railway employee association has sent two representatives to Shenyang to meet with Muto, requesting the Japanese military to send reinforcements in the name of 30,000 South Manchurian Railway employees.</p>
<p>Citibank Photography Incident</p>
<p>Japan's Reply to US Protest Lacks Sincerity</p>

<p>League of Nations</p>
<p>Secretariat to Be Reorganized</p>
<p>Forming a Situation Dominated by Britain and France</p>
<p>Poland Seeks to Re-elect as Semi-Permanent Councillor</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 17th – According to those who are well informed, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Briton Drummond, will step down after this session of the League of Nations General Assembly. Britain and France have already agreed to appoint the current Deputy Secretary-General, Frenchman Avenol, to succeed him. At that time, the Secretariat will also be reorganized, and the three deputy secretaries from Italy, Germany, and Japan will be removed, leaving only the Secretary-General, the Deputy Secretary-General, and the Accountant. It is said that the Deputy Secretary-General will become a purely nominal position, intended for an Italian, and the Accountant will be a Briton, but his powers will be expanded to counterbalance the power of France and Germany after they have acquired the Secretary-General position. It is expected that this reorganization plan will be submitted to the League of Nations Council at this session. Germany and Italy are expected to protest this attempt to strip the two countries of their power and create a situation in the League of Nations where Britain and France have equal shares. However, the German government has anticipated that this change will be implemented and has already indicated that it intends to appoint League of Nations Deputy Secretary Dufour-Feronce as the minister to Portugal.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 16th – The term of the semi-permanent councillor seat in the League of Nations Administrative Council expires this autumn.

However, Gandhi has so far politely refused the countless people who have pleaded with him to postpone his fast, claiming that there are various gratifying reasons, this is a God-given opportunity to provide the final sacrifice for the trampling we have suffered. I have resolved to fast and cannot delay it. God has commanded me to follow my determination. Currently, all the lower classes are passing various motions, thanking Gandhi and praying for his longevity. Bombay business leaders have decided to implement a local boycott from the 20th until Gandhi stops his fast.</p>

<p>German Written Statement</p>
<p>Not Participating in Disarmament Work</p>
<p>Firmly Refusing to Relinquish Demand for Equality</p>
<p>Determined to Conduct Oral Negotiations with France</p>
<p>Believing that Exchange of Official Documents is of No Practical Help</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 16th – The letter from German Foreign Minister Neurath to Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, on the 14th of this month, has recently been officially released. The letter stated, "Any solutions to the disarmament issue must be applicable to Germany before Germany can be asked to participate in the Disarmament Conference to discuss the various disarmament clauses that should be included in the final convention. As long as the above conditions are not met, Germany cannot be asked to participate in negotiations. The Federal Government is eager to realize the conditions for Germany to cooperate with the Disarmament Conference, so it is conducting negotiations through diplomatic procedures to find a way to achieve equality of armaments. Unexpectedly, Germany's various efforts have not yielded any satisfactory results to date, which the Federal Government deeply regrets. Under these circumstances, the Minister has to inform you that the government cannot attend the meeting of the Disarmament Bureau on the 21st of this month as scheduled. We hope for your understanding. However, our country will continue to pay attention to the work of the Disarmament Conference, and its future attitude will also depend on the situation of the conference."</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 16th – Reuters learned today that the German government does not want to reply to the French government's letter refusing Germany's demand for equality of armaments. Although the German government believes that continuing to exchange official documents will not help solve the problem, it stated that it is willing to conduct oral diplomatic negotiations. It has now informed all relevant countries of this intention.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 16th – British Prime Minister MacDonald departed for Chequers Villa this afternoon, but how the British Cabinet will decide on Germany's demand for equality of armaments has not yet been announced. Therefore, it is impossible to know the status of this issue. However, it is heard that the German Chargé d'Affaires in London, Plessen, visited Foreign Secretary Simon regarding this matter. It is generally believed that MacDonald intends to explain Britain's views when the Disarmament Conference convenes again.</p>

<p>Dispute Comes to an End</p>
<p>Rescheduled for Election on November 6th</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 17th – The date for the Reichstag election has been set for November 6th. The Reichstag was dissolved on September 12th due to a Socialist motion urging the cancellation of all emergency decrees.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 17th – The special show that the German Reichstag and its committees put on for the public has ended. The Federal Government has resumed focusing on dealing with important affairs. It will first address the major issue of revitalizing industry and commerce, and has scheduled a cabinet meeting today to discuss economic and financial matters, including the long-disputed issue of reducing interest rates. Because the discount rate will be reduced from 5% to 4% within the next week, the issue of reducing interest rates has become the most urgent matter at hand. A new draft order will also be discussed at today's cabinet meeting, which will make it easier for banks to grant loans to benefit industry and commerce. Recently, the German Industrial Federation warned the government not to hastily adopt the quota system for imported goods before consulting with export industries and foreign countries, saying that this system violates the government's principle of economic freedom. However, agricultural circles are eager for the realization of this proposal, viewing it as necessary to protect German agricultural products. It is said that Papen will go to Munich at the beginning of next month to discuss this issue with the Bavarian business community.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Commemoration of the September 18th National Crisis <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>A Heartfelt Appeal to the Nation by Ma Zhanshan</p>
<p>The heartbreaking September 18th Incident, without realizing it, has passed for a whole year. In this year, my compatriots in the Northeast have suffered the pain of national subjugation, which has only intensified. My loyal and patriotic soldiers have sacrificed themselves in the Black Mountains and White Waters, striving for national glory, fighting for national dignity, and upholding justice and righteousness for humanity. They have fallen one after another, following closely without interruption. My elders, brothers, sisters, and female cousins at home and abroad have been concerned about the fall of the Northeast territory, have helped the displaced compatriots of the Northeast, and have given material and spiritual encouragement to the front-line soldiers who have risked their lives to kill the enemy. Their benevolence and righteousness have been boundless. Zhanshan, awaiting punishment in the military, has received much favor. However, looking back on the results of the struggle and sacrifice of the past year, not only have we failed to expel the strong enemy and restore our rivers and mountains, but the puppet state has also calmly taken the stage. There is no matter more heartbreaking than this. Today, on the day of the commemoration of the September 18th National Crisis, Zhanshan dares to sincerely appeal to my patriotic compatriots: As long as the lost territory of the Northeast is not recovered for a single day, Zhanshan will not cease fighting for a single day. Even if I have only my last bullet, I will kill one enemy to repay the country. This heart and this will have already been stated in telegrams. Now, I will again respectfully report to the nation the progress of Zhanshan's resistance against Japan over the past ten months, as well as my determination to fight in the future.</p>
<p>Last year's September 18th Incident was by no means accidental. Japan had been planning and plotting to invade and occupy Manchuria and Mongolia long before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. However, due to the obstruction of the powers, they did not have the opportunity. Therefore, they endured for decades until today. Now, all countries in the world are facing a severe economic crisis, and they are all busy dealing with the financial and economic problems of their own countries and related countries, and have no time to care about the Far East. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan has not yet been completed, and it cannot abandon its national construction plan to compete with Japan for foreign markets. Moreover, its national strength is insufficient, and even if it wants to compete with Japan for dominance, it cannot be sure of victory. In addition, our country is plagued by natural disasters and banditry, which are widespread throughout the country, and the national defense of the Northeast is also inadequate. All kinds of reasons are enough to arouse the Japanese people's covetous thoughts. Therefore, they brazenly disregarded everything and carried out the violent occupation of Shenyang on September 18th. First, they disarmed our troops and seized our political power, and then they directed the traitors to organize local maintenance associations and establish autonomous guidance departments, causing Jilin and Heilongjiang to fall. Then, they further encouraged the puppets to establish the so-called Manchuria, in order to achieve their final goal of invading Manchuria and Mongolia. The League of Nations Covenant is not to be feared, the Nine-Power Treaty is not to be counted, and the warnings of the powers and the resistance of the Chinese people are not to be worried about. It is like having gold in front of them, only seeing the gold and not seeing the people. Their greed is hateful and their viciousness is fearful. As for why the Japanese dared to take the risk of injustice to forcibly occupy our three northeastern provinces, there is a reason. Tanaka Giichi's memorial on the positive policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia has already explained it in detail. It said, “If we want to conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia. If we want to conquer the world, we must first conquer China. If China is completely conquered by our country, other foreign nations such as Central and Small Asia, India, and the South Seas will fear and respect us and surrender to us, so that the world will know that East Asia is our East Asia, and will never dare to invade us. This is the legacy of Emperor Meiji, and it is also a necessary thing for the existence of our Japanese Empire.” This is from a political point of view. Japan's ambition is to use the occupation of Manchuria and Mongolia as the first step in conquering the world. As for the economic significance, it said, “If our rights in Manchuria and Mongolia can truly be in our hands, then we can use Manchuria and Mongolia as a base, use the mask of trade to sweep across China's four hundred and odd states, and then use the rights in Manchuria and Mongolia as a command tower to seize China's resources, and use China's resources to conquer India and the South Seas Islands, as well as Central and Small Asia and Europe. The first key to our Yamato nation's desire to set foot on the Asian continent is to grasp the rights and interests of Manchuria and Mongolia. Moreover, the final victor relies on food, the prosperity of industry relies on raw materials, and the fulfillment of national power relies on a vast Chinese territory. If our rights in Manchuria and Mongolia are expanded with a positive policy, we can solve all kinds of major national factors, not to mention that our country's annual surplus of 700,000 people can also be solved at the same time. If we want to implement the Showa Restoration and achieve the permanent prosperity of our empire, we must only focus on the principle of actively pursuing the rights and interests of Manchuria and Mongolia.” This is the truth about the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, which was completely revealed by Tanaka's mouth. Yet they still deceive the world by saying that they have no ambition for territory. Who would believe it? Because of this, if we want to subdue these stubborn bandits and protect our sovereignty, we must fight them with force, and it is not enough to frustrate the enemy's edge and kill the enemy's spirit. This is why Zhanshan had the battle of Jiangqiao to kill the bandits on November 4th of last year. Since then, there has hardly been a day when I have not been in the midst of guns and bullets, advancing and retreating, fighting and resting. It has been more than ten months since I telegraphed my resistance. Fortunately, with the assistance of the people and the dedication of the soldiers, Zhanshan has been able to support the critical situation with an isolated army in the border region. Even the ruthless artillery fire of the stubborn bandits cannot do anything to my brothers with red hearts and righteous courage.</p>
<p>Earlier, after the Japanese bandits occupied Changchun, they used Zhang Hai Peng to advance into Heihe. At that time, Zhanshan was ordered to act as chairman. On October 3rd, the Japanese consul stationed in Jiang province came to visit, saying that the Japanese army would repair the Nenjiang Iron Bridge, which I firmly refused. On the morning of the 4th, a large Japanese army attacked me and was defeated and fled. On the morning of the 5th, the enemy army attacked again, with more intense artillery fire. Our army fought bravely at night, killing three or four hundred bandits, and the morale of the army was greatly boosted. After suffering a setback, the enemy increased its artillery force by more than a thousand men and transferred them from the Siping-Taonan Railway to Jiangqiao Station. Japanese troops from various places gathered and crossed the river at night, and countless of them were sunk by us. On the 6th, the enemy further increased its strength and used armored vehicles to cover its advance. The firepower of airplanes and artillery was the most intense. Our army felt great difficulty and had to retreat to Daxing Station. Then, we joined forces to counterattack and surrounded the enemy, and after a fierce battle all day, we were able to repel the enemy. On the 7th, more enemies arrived, and we also increased our reinforcements and cooperated to attack, killing thousands of enemies, and the bodies were all over the field. The bandit crowd was defeated and fled across the river in a panic. We then restored the first line of defense, so the front line was more solid, and the enemy did not dare to underestimate our army. After the Japanese were defeated, they hurriedly transferred the Hasegawa Brigade and the Amano Brigade from Changchun to fight. In addition, cavalry artillery came to support in turn, and dozens of aircraft bombed in rotation. Our army fought bravely to be the first, and after half an hour of hand-to-hand combat, they finally repelled the stubborn bandits. As a result of the fierce battles on the 6th and 7th, the enemy army suffered a disastrous defeat, and our losses were also not light. It is estimated that the number of enemy troops killed and wounded in this battle was about two thousand. After the enemy army was defeated on the 7th, they retreated to the south of the Nenjiang Bridge to wait for reinforcements before attacking again, so there was nothing peaceful before the 11th. On the 12th, the great battle began again. Zhanshan had sent two telegrams, Yu and Yu, to inform the people of the country of this battle. On the 12th, the enemy army attacked me with a force of seven thousand infantrymen. At the same time, Honjo sent a letter to Zhanshan, demanding (1) Zhanshan to step down, (2) the Heihe army to withdraw from Qiqihar, and (3) a part of the Japanese army to advance to Angangxi, and set a deadline for a reply before 12 o'clock that night. At that time, Zhanshan had received orders from Vice Commander Zhang to resolutely reject them and prepare to resist to the death. On the night of the 12th, the Japanese infantry and artillery attacked our defense line. On the morning of the 13th, they attacked our cavalry position with a small force. On the morning of the 14th, the artillerymen detoured from the west and launched a fierce attack on our cavalry defense line. The Japanese army opened fire on the front to contain our infantry and artillery forces. Our defense line shook. Fortunately, the reinforcements of the Tu Quan Sheng Regiment arrived, and the entire regiment charged into hand-to-hand combat. The sound of killing shook the sky, and the bandit army was greatly frightened and fled in a panic, with countless dead and wounded. Since this defeat, the Japanese knew that our army was good at fighting, so they greatly increased their reinforcements, and airplanes, artillery, tanks, field guns, and various weapons were used together. They also transferred the troops stationed in Korea and joined the front line. From the 15th to the 18th, after four days of great battles, we were unable to support it due to our lack of troops and weak equipment. Therefore, on the 18th, we had to lead our troops to withdraw from Heihe and stationed in Keshan. During the retreat, the Japanese army pursued along the way with 20,000 troops and were ambushed twice, killing countless enemies. Then, because Keshan was too small, they led the majority of the troops to Hailun, where the provincial government headquarters were located, and Keshan and Baiquan were used as the second line of defense. The process of retreating has been reported to the whole country in a clever telegram in November. After Zhanshan arrived in Hailun, he actively replenished his military supplies to make a final resistance. Soon after the battle of Harbin broke out, the Japanese enemy again attacked Lindian, Yi'an, Keshan and other counties with heavy troops, so they sent troops to block and attack on the one hand, and assisted Ding and Li on the other hand. Unexpectedly, the Heihe army had not yet arrived in Harbin, and the troops of Ding and Li had retreated one after another. After the Japanese bandits occupied my Harbin, they learned that my army was divided to assist Ding and Li, so they drove elite troops to take Hailun, in order to eliminate my army's strength. At that time, my army had a strong enemy pressing in front of them, and no important passes to defend behind them. Ammunition was scarce and reinforcements were cut off, and the situation was extremely critical. Since Zhanshan resisted Japan, he had long put life and death out of his mind. However, the strong bandits had not been eliminated, and the national crisis was urgent. The enemy was strong and we were weak, and the bandits were numerous and we were few. If we were to sacrifice the country's strength and steal personal loyalty and national honor, we would be a traitor to the country. Therefore, I resolutely held a secret meeting with Ding, Li and others in the county town of Hulan to discuss countermeasures. They all believed that the crisis of survival was imminent, and there was no time to waste. If we wanted to solve the current difficulties, we could only use a trick to deceive the enemy and slow down their pursuit, and we could save our strength and wait for the troops in Guannei to come out, and then raise the banner of righteousness to act as an internal response to achieve the effect of a pincer attack. And the various conspiracies of the Japanese bandits to invade us could also be detected at any time. After the meeting was decided, they proposed the following surrender conditions to the enemy general Domon's division: 1. Stop all military actions against Jilin and Heilongjiang. 2. Do not kill the people. 3. Replenish ammunition and military pay. The draft of these conditions was carried to Harbin by the traitorous Chinese traitors Zhao Zhongren and Han Yunkai. Domon fully accepted it and asked the two Chinese traitors, Zhao and Han, to return to Hulan to report and urge Zhanshan to personally go to Harbin to meet with Domon. Domon held a banquet at the Hotel Matier, without any suspicion, and urged him to return to the province as soon as possible to preside over the military and civilian affairs. Zhanshan returned to Hulan that night and appointed Zhao and Han as representatives to stay in Harbin to handle affairs. Immediately, he invited Ding and Li to report the results of the contact with Domon and secretly decided to expand his strength and wait for an opportunity to act. He appointed Liang Zhen as the commander-in-chief of the Heilongjiang Province People's Army, stationed in Hailun. Each county was assigned a commander of the headquarters, and three cavalry companies were established in each county, with 160 men in each company. They were actively trained and ordered the guard regiment to move to Hulan to protect the Huhai Railway, and the name of the guard regiment was abolished to cover up the eyes and ears of the Japanese bandits. The ammunition and clothing stored in Hailun were moved to Longmen (about 400 miles north of Hailun). The general office of Heilongjiang Guangxin Company was actually still located in Hailun, but nominally moved back to Jiang Province. All the important documents of the military office were handed over to the commander-in-chief of the People's Army for safekeeping. The talented staff and adjutants of the military office who advocated resistance against Japan were all dismissed, but secretly they were assigned the responsibility of military training in the People's Army, or served as leaders. Furthermore, in the name of clearing debts, Ling Zikui was ordered to go to Heihe first. After the deployment was completed, he went to the province alone (Qiqihar). The Japanese bandits welcomed him warmly. On the one hand, they secretly ordered the various armies under his command to make active preparations and wait for an opportunity to revolt. On the other hand, they secretly contacted Ding and Li to request the Japanese side to replenish ammunition and supply military pay. The Japanese bandits did everything. After the internal affairs were fulfilled, they only waited for the troops in Guannei to come out. When they heard that the League of Nations Investigation Team was about to leave the customs, they thought that the time had come. If they continued to endure, they would miss the opportunity. They decided to take the opportunity to raise the banner of righteousness again, to guide the people's spirit, and to announce all kinds of conspiracies of the Japanese bandits as much as possible in order to seek international sympathy. However, although the Japanese bandits deeply believed that there was nothing else, the surveillance was still strict. Therefore, they secretly made a plan to escape the danger, ignoring military and political affairs, indulging in wine and women. Moreover, every day, they played bamboo warfare with the Japanese enemy, Commander Suzuki, and Japanese dignitaries in the Resident Jiang Manchu Railway Office. The last time, they even fought for three days and three nights without stopping. On the third night, at noon, he suddenly pretended to have severe abdominal pain, saying that he had to return to the office to take medicine, and would be back soon. Suzuki and others were also extremely tired because they had not slept for several nights, so they did not think carefully and fell asleep at their desks. At dawn, he had left Jiang Province and arrived in Baiquan. He pretended to send a telegram to Commander Suzuki, saying that the military's heart was unstable, so he came to instruct him in person, and thanked him for his many caring in Jiang. When Suzuki and others received the telegram, they were greatly shocked and realized that they had been tricked. They deeply regretted not listening to the words of Honjo Shigeru. Honjo Shigeru's talent and knowledge were still considered outstanding among the Japanese bandit generals who invaded the Northeast. He had the reputation of Zhanshan as a famous Chinese general and a national hero, which had already shaken the world. Now, because his ammunition was exhausted and reinforcements were cut off, he came back alone without his family members or his guard troops and military equipment, and he was constantly expanding his army, which must have hidden treachery. He strongly advocated taking the opportunity to buy Chinese people to assassinate him in order to eliminate future troubles. Suzuki and others did not listen, so they have today's regret. The details of this have been telegraphed to the whole country on April 13th, and the original text is as follows (to be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Shandong People Initiate Aviation Salvation Association <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Plan to Raise 500,000 Yuan to Purchase Six Aircraft</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In modern warfare, the air force is the only sharp weapon. All countries in the East and West are actively expanding it and progressing rapidly. However, our country's air force is very weak. Since the outbreak of the Northeast Incident, the national crisis has become increasingly urgent. In order to consolidate national defense and resist foreign aggression, aviation salvation associations have been initiated in various places, with people freely donating funds to purchase aircraft and form salvation aviation troops. Shandong Province connects the north and south, is adjacent to a strong enemy in the east, has many important ports and numerous ports. It is an important area in military terms and is of great importance to national defense. Recently, more than 20 people, including Wang Zhanyuan, Jin Yun'e, Ma Liang, Xin Zhujiu, chairman of the provincial business association, Miao Xingcai, chairman of the Jinan Flour Industry Association, He Dingyuan, president of the Bank of China, Lu Tingzhuan, president of the Bank of Communications, Zhao Xinru, manager of the Shandong Official Pawnshop, and Zhang Shuheng, chairman of the Jinan Chamber of Commerce, initiated and organized the Shandong Salvation Aviation Association. They plan to raise donations to purchase aircraft and hand them over to the provincial government to form the Shandong Salvation Aviation Army, so that they can assist the navy and army in resisting foreign aggression when the country is in trouble. The association has been brewing for many days and is now organized. On the evening of the 13th, the initiators held a banquet for the province's party and government leaders at the Bank of Communications, explaining the purpose of the association and asking for assistance in carrying it out. Zhang Weicun, the province's rectification committee, and others greatly praised it. Immediately, Jin Yun'e, Wang Zhanyuan, Zhao Xinru, Miao Xingcun, Shi Shaoxian, Ma Liang, Xin Zhujiu, Zhang Shuheng, He Dingyuan, Lu Tingzhuan, Guo Zuoting and other 21 people were designated as preparation committee members, responsible for planning and carrying out the project. It was decided to hold the first preparation committee meeting at Daguanyuan at 3 pm on the 16th to discuss the issuance of donation announcements and widely solicit donations so that aircraft can be purchased and the air force can be organized as soon as possible. According to the initiators of the association, it is difficult to predict the results of future fundraising, but in any case, the funds raised must be more than 500,000 yuan, which can buy six aircraft, so that a team of salvation aviation troops can be organized. If more donations are received, all of them will be used to purchase aircraft and will not be used for other purposes (15th).</p>
<h3 id="e14">Chiang Kai-shek's Letter to Six Provincial Governments to Prepare Grain Storage <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Also Encourage Rural Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: In order to prepare grain storage and encourage animal husbandry, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a letter to the chairmen of six provinces, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, on the 15th to instruct them on the methods. The original letter is as follows: "Brothers Mo San, Yong An, Li Qing, Tian Yi, Yun Qiao, and Ling Bing, I have learned that the system of grain storage has been passed down from ancient times to the present, without any change. Even in the late Qing Dynasty, after the great chaos of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, all provinces in the southeast, whether in poor rural areas or remote areas, had public and private granaries with sufficient grain storage. In lean years, they were released on credit, and in years of famine, they were sold at a fixed price, so even in years of drought and flood, the people did not suffer from hunger. Since the past ten years, wars and bandit disasters have continued incessantly, and the private storage systems of various provinces have been largely destroyed. If there is a slight famine, the fields are filled with cries of sorrow. Every time I think about this, I feel pain. It is imperative to repair and restore it as soon as possible. In the past, Confucius said that in politics, sufficient food comes before sufficient soldiers. Guan Zhong said that in governance, the four pillars must be based on the reality of the granaries. In recent times, European and American countries have sufficient preparations and detailed statistics for the national food supply. It is known that the people's food is the source of governance and chaos in a country and is related to the strength or weakness of national power. Therefore, I especially send this letter to my brother, urging him to supervise the counties under his jurisdiction, take advantage of the harvest season to actively prepare grain storage, and take the total population of each county as a ratio, and set aside at least three months' worth of food for storage. The quantity must not be vague, and the deadline must not be delayed. All the old, daily-average warehouses in the counties, townships, and cities that still maintain a good system and have no loopholes should continue to follow the old rules and be carefully maintained. Those that have been destroyed or even completely destroyed should also be strictly reorganized and ordered to be restored. All of these facilities should be completed within three months. Supervise and urge the departments to complete the work and strictly order the counties to report to the provincial government on schedule with accurate statistics as the standard for the provincial grain storage. In addition, rural animal husbandry, such as cattle, sheep, mules, horses, as well as raising chickens and pigs, are also supplementary foods and have a significant relationship with rural cultivation, transportation, and economy. It is also hoped that new scientific methods will be adopted to improve breeding and formulate reward rules to promote animal husbandry in a practical way. For families with a particularly large number of livestock, cattle, and horses, they should be given special awards, so that the people will be inspired and animal husbandry will flourish. Then, the abundance of materials and people will be a profound contribution to increasing the strength of the people. In short, grain storage is enough to prevent changes and stabilize the people, and animal husbandry is enough to enrich the people and provide for their needs. Although the two seem insignificant, they are both the foundation of governance. Please follow the instructions in this letter and implement them seriously. In addition to sending separate letters to the provincial governments of (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei) to supervise and carry out the work at the same time, this letter is specially sent to you for compliance, and I hope that you will report the progress of the work at any time so that I can assess the situation."

<p>Dispute over Standards for Collecting Land Survey Fees: The County Government, acting upon instructions from provincial authorities, has ordered the survey of farmland and the collection of land survey expenses under the land tax, charging one dime per mu. For areas less than one mu, it is calculated as one mu, and the collection will continue for three years, with the funds being saved and used for the purpose. However, businesses in the county claim that the provincial method calculates one fen per mu as two mu, and 0.9 mu is also calculated as two mu, resulting in an uneven distribution of burdens. Farms with fragmented land also have separate calculations for each share and fraction. They should immediately unite all businesses in the county and petition the province to fight for a fair system. It was decided that a meeting would be held at 2 PM today (the 17th) at the First District Office to discuss the matter. Over one hundred people attended, and Zhong Taichi was elected chairman. The discussion points were: (1) Regarding the provincial regulations, a resolution was passed to send representatives to the county to inquire about the matter. Wu Juchi, Xi Qianzeng, Du Jinhou, Zhu Shujian, and Zhong Taichi were appointed as the five representatives to go to the County Government to transcribe the provincial regulations. (2) Regarding the standard for collecting land survey fees, a resolution was passed to collect the fees according to the land value tax method, verifying the amount. A petition will be drafted immediately and submitted to the province with the names and seals of those present, striving for the goal of verified collection, so as to meet the principle of equal burden.</p>

<p>New Trends in Opium Monopoly: Due to opposition from various parties, the opium monopoly issue has undergone changes, transforming into a public transportation and sale of domestic opium, implementing a system of government opium and private sales. The Suzhou contractor is a Mr. Qiu, with 35 sub-distribution directors managed by Du Changlin and others. The Suzhou Anti-Drug Association has learned that the contractors are currently buying public opinion, providing monthly subsidies to newspapers: fifty yuan for broadsheets and thirty yuan for four-page and tri-weekly publications, for a period of three months, with payment due on the 20th. Negotiations for selling domestic opium are taking place at the Guo family's opium warehouse in Shanmen Lane, with the condition that the newspapers refuse to publish news from the Anti-Drug Association. Therefore, the association plans to issue a second declaration, firmly opposing the practice.</p>
<p>High Court Executes Murderer by Hanging: Gu Zengbao, a resident of Zhouzhuang in Wu County, was convicted of murdering Sun Baofeng, the husband of Sun Dan, a fellow villager, on July 8th of the 15th year of the Republic. After being apprehended, he was sentenced to death by the Wu County District Court. The third and final trial upheld the death sentence. With the approval of the Provincial Government obtained through the High Court, the prisoner Gu Zengbao was transferred from the detention center to the execution ground on the morning of the 17th at 8 AM and executed by hanging.</p>

<p>Misfortunes Befall Liu Laofu and Son: Liu Laofu and his son, Liu Rongsheng, residents of Shilangzhong Lane inside the South Gate, are both heavily addicted to opium. On the 28th of last month, they were suddenly arrested by the First Public Security Bureau and sent to the County Court Prosecutor's Office. After questioning by Chief Prosecutor Zhou, they were ordered to each pay fifty yuan in cash as bail. However, the Liu family was destitute and had to remain in jail. After Liu Laofu was imprisoned, only his wife, daughter-in-law, and grandson remained at home. His wife, Mrs. Yang, recently fell ill and was bedridden, moaning in pain. As if misfortunes never come singly, on the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Liu's daughter-in-law saw bedbugs on her mother-in-law's mosquito net and used a kerosene lamp to catch them. By accident, the net caught fire. In an instant, the fire spread, and Mrs. Liu Yang was unable to escape, perishing in the flames. Liu's daughter-in-law also burned her right hand. Nearby neighbors rushed to extinguish the fire, finally putting it out. Afterwards, the Tu Zheng (local head) Wang Yongtai reported the incident to the County Court, requesting the release of either Liu Laofu or his son on bail in order to provide a coffin and bury the body. It is truly a tragic tale.</p>
<p>School Cook Poisons Porridge Pot: The County Girls' Middle School in Xiaolou Lane in the city has been established for many years and is thriving. In June of this year, Principal Gu Gujia, through Zhou Xieqing's recommendation, hired Hua Quan'gen as the food service manager. After three months, during the autumn festival, the school's general affairs officer, Guo Zhengmo, discovered that Quan'gen had embezzled all three hundred yuan of the school's food expenses, and that the rice, oil, vegetables, etc., were all purchased on credit. Furthermore, Quan'gen's cooking was unhygienic, so he was dismissed and replaced by Xu Alin. Resentful of his dismissal, Quan'gen plotted revenge. Yesterday morning, while Xu Alin was cooking porridge, Quan'gen secretly ordered his wife, Hua Jiang, and Zhu Rongchun to put poison in the porridge, causing the white porridge to turn a sauce-yellow color. The entire school, teachers and students alike, were in uproar upon seeing this, but fortunately, none of them had eaten it. Hua Quan'gen, Jiang, Zhu Rongchun, as well as Guo Zhengmo and Xu Alin, were all sent to the First Public Security Bureau. After a preliminary interrogation by Chief Gao, they were all sent to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation, along with the four barrels of poisoned porridge.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Continue to Request Rent Reduction: Due to the decline of the silk market and the failure of various factories, the silk factories in the county, led by Miao Shaoqing and others, jointly petitioned the County Government during this national crisis for a reduction or exemption of factory rent to ease their burdens. After receiving the petition, the County Government, citing the contractual relationship between the factories and the landowners, invited both parties to negotiate, but no concrete solution was reached. Yesterday, Miao Shaoqing and others continued their previous proposal, requesting the County Government to promptly convene the Party Department, the Chamber of Commerce, and factory owners and tenants to discuss and resolve the issue, in order to help Suzhou merchants in their difficulties.</p>

<p>Detective Team Captures Robbers: The Liu Sandajia family in Nanliujia Village, Heliu Township, in the Seventh District of Wu County, was robbed some time ago. Recently, the detective team captured Yin Heer, a robber involved in the case, who confessed to the robbery. Yesterday (the 16th), another accomplice, Yu Xida, was arrested and handed over to the county. After interrogation, Yin Heer confessed that Yu Xida had invited him to participate in the robbery, along with more than ten others, armed with six guns. He also said that the loot was distributed at Yu's house. After the interrogation, they were ordered to be shackled and imprisoned separately.</p>
<p>Carpenters' Guild Strikes: The carpenters' guild in Wu County went on strike on the 16th due to the unresolved issue of the "tie-ba" fee (a type of commission). They have stopped accepting measurements of timber rafts anchored above the Xinzha Dam and have secretly agreed that they will not work until the "tie-ba" fee issue is resolved. Violators will be punished as a warning. The timber merchants have not yet made any statement.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Aviation Construction</p>
<p>Compiled by the China Aviation Construction Association</p>
<h3 id="e20">The Establishment and Current Status of the China Aviation Construction Association <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>By Luo Yinpu</p>
<p>(I) Reasons for its Emergence: The China Aviation Construction Association is a direct product of the Shanghai War and a new expression of the Chinese people's awakening, gathering their practical strength to engage in aviation construction. During the Battle of Shanghai, the enemy, taking advantage of our weak air defenses, was able to maximize the power of their aircraft, causing immense harm to both our military and civilians. After the Shanghai War, the enemy was deeply impressed by the power of their aircraft and thus mobilized the full strength of their government and people to expand their air force. We, the Chinese people, being the victims, have learned a deeper and more profound lesson than the enemy. Therefore, after the war, the call for aviation to save the nation spread throughout the country. Overseas Chinese, in particular, actively promoted this cause, donating large sums of money or purchasing aircraft to assist the government in external self-defense. At this point, the Chinese people deeply realized that national defense is essential for saving the nation, developing aviation is essential for strengthening national defense, and developing aviation requires the combined efforts of the entire nation, assisting the government, and working together. Therefore, the organization of this association is a crystallization of this widespread sentiment.</p>
<p>(II) Process of Establishment: After the Shanghai War, in the wake of the severe pain, the Chinese people began to contemplate remedial measures. Realizing the weakness of our national air defense and understanding the limitations of the government's capabilities, they resolved to catch up, relying on the people. However, the people's strength was dispersed and unorganized, so without organization, the strength would be insufficient, and without unity, the results would be insignificant. Therefore, establishing an organization to promote and guide was essential. In April, Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Mr. Xiong Xiling, Mr. Xu Shiying, Mr. Chen Lianbo, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Yin Zhiling, and other leaders from various sectors of society, together with aviator Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan, jointly initiated this association. Immediately, various sectors responded enthusiastically and agreed. On June 28th, the inaugural meeting was held at the YMCA in Ba Xianqiao, Shanghai. Over a hundred people, including the association's founders and representatives from various sectors, gathered to support this great cause, which was truly a grand event. With the foundation of the association established, the headquarters were set up at No. 610 Continental Mansion on Nanjing Road, and the application for registration was submitted to the Ministry of Transportation of the National Government, which was approved. The future success depends on the extent of our efforts.</p>
<p>(III) Objectives: What are the objectives of this association? In short, it is to realize the meaning of "aviation to save the nation." Everything from promoting the importance of aviation, training aviation personnel, developing the aviation industry, and establishing aviation factories are all activities that the association plans to undertake and strive for, all with the ultimate goal of saving the nation and strengthening the country. Today, the national crisis is at its peak, and the emptiness of our national defense is the reason for the humiliation. If we want to talk about national defense, there is nothing better than building a strong air force. To build an air force, it is essential that our compatriots across the country awaken, rise up, and contribute their human and material resources for national use, and ultimately achieve success. Building an air force is easy and quick, and its combat power surpasses that of the army and navy. What other path is there to self-strengthening? The association's lofty goals are well-founded. (IV) Current Situation: Since its establishment, the association has spared no effort in carrying out various tasks. We believe that although the people understand the importance of aviation, they have not made a firm determination to build it. Although society pays attention to aviation news, they have not deeply felt the interest in participating in learning. To promote and awaken, publicity is still needed. Looking around the country, the aviation community lacks both common publications and systematic works. Therefore, the association publishes special issues to promote aviation and compile series of books to broaden research. In addition, we organize publicity meetings, hold exhibitions, etc., to generate interest. This is the initial stage of the association's work. Today, the most difficult problem in China's aviation community is the lack of talent. Manufacturing requires talent, and piloting requires talent. Without talent, things cannot be put to good use. Therefore, education is still needed. In this regard, the association is preparing to establish aviation engineering classes to cultivate manufacturing talent and preparing to open aviation schools to train piloting talent (see the draft plan for the association's preliminary education and manufacturing work). Although the scale is small, the achievements are promising. Other important tasks are also being implemented in order. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will act with the sincerity of saving the nation and encourage each other.</p>
<p>(V) Welcome Compatriots to Join the Association: The association was born in the midst of national crisis and stands for the goal of saving the nation. Therefore, all compatriots have the obligation to participate in the work, either by participating in person or by providing financial assistance, each contributing their abilities and resources to help the development of the association. Then, in the future, our country will become an aviation country, our people will become an aviation nation, bringing light to the world and happiness to mankind. Is this not a dream? Is this not a dream?</p>
<h3 id="e21">Declaration of the Association for Soliciting Members <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Since the loss of the Northeast, the people have been tormented by激昂and悲愤, and the government has struggled in a state of徬徨and无措. Time has passed, and the first year of that tragic and shameful event has already passed. The lost land remains, and the disasters deepen. Today, we are逼于生死存亡無可假借之機. If our people do not want to be slaves of a self-destroyed country, and do not want to be slaves of world shame, then we must urgently seek self-salvation. It is now 逼于千鈞一髮無可敷衍之候. In the Shanghai War, the defeat was not due to the army, nor to the battleships, but solely to the lack of air defense. The Northeast Volunteer Army, wandering and displaced, was not困于敵兵, nor吓于敵砲, but solely為敵機所摧殘壓迫. After the hard battle, Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan發為"空軍之威力, 施之於無抵抗之對方, 其效為不可思議,"之嘆息. Considering all these, we know that the欺壓摧殘suffered by our country and our people實在于空防之無備. Thinking of this, how can we not感痛. Our association was established after the Shanghai War,奮鬭於國難之中. Fortunately, we have received the enthusiastic support of our compatriots, and experts have worked hard to operate. The development of the association is逐日有增. Since the government approved the registration, the work has been even more active. Our colleagues do not feel菲薄and勉効涓埃. The 区区之望is在于集合全國民眾力量, 協助政府, 建設强大之空軍, 以自立于弱肉强呑之世界. This heart and this ambition, I think, is sympathized by my patriotic compatriots. Now, at the time of the tragic national disaster commemoration, we爰有擴大組織徵求會員之舉. When my compatriots see蒿目时艰and伤心国难, they should be able to群趋救亡之道, join this association, and共求中国航空之发展, and图自强于将来. Sincerely declare,伏维鉴察.</p>

<p>To all newspapers, all sectors, all institutions, all schools, all organizations, and overseas Chinese: Since暴日凭陵, the Northeast has fallen, the Shanghai War of Resistance has occurred, and our territory has finally been stained. Although it is said that the Japanese invaders are狂横and罔顧公理, the reason is that our 武備不修and國防虚弱, 實為啓侮诲禍之由. In the Shanghai War, our 19th Route Army奮力抗戰and屢挫兇頑, but in the end, due to the lack of resistance in the air, the soldiers lost the opportunity to歼敌. This is what Brigade Commander Weng, who guarded Wusong, painfully said. It is truly a浩歎. Today, General Ma Zhanshan is苦戰海倫, and is also facing oppression everywhere by enemy aircraft. There is no way to resist, the soldiers are displaced, which makes people悲憤欲絶. Comparing the past and the present, it is clear that without an air force, there is no way to win, and without an air force, there will be defeat. If one passes through the ruins of Zhabei and Wusong, and imagines the ashes of the cities in the Black provinces, can anyone not痛哭流涕? Since the沈變, almost a year has passed. The lost land has not been recovered, and the disasters are deepening. The bombing of Chaoyang has not stopped, and the enemy troops in Shanghai have increased again. The violence is不可逆覩. However, the way to self-salvation is在于人為. Our association is盱衡时艰and勉圖自效. We believe that saving the nation is 重於國防, and國防 is 首於空軍. The establishment of an air force depends on the共與其成 of our compatriots at home and abroad. Now, on the anniversary of the沈變, there should be a澈底救國建設空軍之議. I therefore offer four suggestions, and hope that you will consider them. (1) Local newspapers, magazines, and various publications should publish materials commemorating the national humiliation on September 18, with the focus on宣傳航空救國. (2) All sectors, all institutions, all schools, all organizations, and overseas Chinese should hold national humiliation commemoration meetings on September 18, with speeches or performances on航空救國 as the focus of commemorating the national humiliation. (3) The expenses for stopping entertainment and banquets on September 18 by all sectors, all institutions, all schools, all organizations, and overseas Chinese should be saved in banks or money shops to充航空建設基金. (4) From September 18, all sectors, all institutions, all schools, all organizations, and overseas Chinese should each pledge to建設航空, join this association, and共同努力 to固國防and紓國難. Alas, the national crisis has reached its peak. The機 of存亡 is繫於一髮. 載胥及溺, 能不凛然. Today, the Chinese people also know救國, and救國 must say aviation. The point is to見諸實行. The above four points, if we can achieve one, I hope that my patriotic compatriots will jointly plan it. I have always admired your熱忱and爱国, and I hope that you will inform your subordinates to implement it together. If you have any inquiries, please send a letter to the China Aviation Construction Association, Continental Mansion, Nanjing Road, Shanghai. The China Aviation Construction Association.</p>

<p>Wang Zhitao</p>
<p>Our country's aviation industry is still in its infancy. In recent years, China National Aviation Corporation's aircraft have been carrying passengers and cargo between Shanghai and Hankou, which is a rudimentary model of the aviation industry. Since the establishment of this company, its business has been developing well, and passengers also find it convenient. It can be seen that our country has a vast territory, and water and land transportation in various places are not yet very convenient. In terms of the needs of modern transportation, developing the aviation industry is currently one of the most important things for our country. That is, in terms of developing other commerce, industry, education, people's intelligence, and eliminating internal troubles and enhancing international status, etc., all of these can be promoted through the development of the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Since the reform in our country, internal strife has been frequent, and we are surrounded by strong neighbors. Recently, since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident in the Northeast and Shanghai, etc., we have received extremely serious and painful lessons. All those with blood and spirit take washing away the shame and strengthening the country as the main goal, and aviation construction is the most important of all. The public is even more enthusiastic about advocating it. Therefore, the China Aviation Construction Association was established in response to the times, and the aviation industry has begun to see a glimmer of light. This is what we should all celebrate. I hope that the people of the whole country will unite and work hard to complete this great undertaking. As the saying goes, "Many a little makes a mickle," and "Unity is strength." Hopefully, foreign aggression and domestic troubles can be eliminated immediately. I hope that my comrades will work hard on this, and there is great hope for the future of aviation. In building the aviation industry, the first priority is cultivating talent, followed by perfecting aircraft and other equipment. From my humble point of view, anyone with aviation knowledge must have considerable wireless communication knowledge. No matter how perfect other equipment is, wireless communication equipment is indispensable. This is what we should pay close attention to. The ability of aircraft to fly to various places, carrying passengers and cargo, is like people having hands and feet to do things and walk. The meaning is the same. However, when an aircraft is flying and suddenly encounters heavy fog, and the direction is not clear, it can safely reach its destination without danger only by relying on wireless communication. This wireless communication device is the eyes of the aircraft. During flight, it reports the weather in various places it passes to various land stations, to serve as a reference for later aircraft, avoiding dangerous areas. This function of wireless communication equipment is the communication center of the aircraft. Being able to listen to all kinds of news from various places in the air at any time also relies solely on wireless communication equipment. This wireless communication equipment is the ears of the aircraft. Now, in Europe and the United States, the aviation industry has become extremely developed and safe. All passenger and cargo aircraft, large and small, are equipped with wireless communication equipment. Therefore, no matter how bad the weather is or how difficult the navigation is, the function of wireless communication can be used to avoid danger and seek good fortune at any time, reduce the degree of danger, and increase safety and efficiency. Therefore, it is said that wireless communication equipment has a close relationship with the aviation industry and is the most important and indispensable equipment.</p>
<p>Recently, I read a wireless communication magazine that had a record about aviation and wireless communication. I will excerpt the main points below for our reference, which I believe those who care about the aviation industry will be happy to hear.</p>
<p>Before passenger and cargo aircraft take off, they have already received reports on the weather conditions at various stations along the route. If there is no great danger, they can proceed without worry. In case of sudden changes in the weather, such as wind and rain, they can detour to avoid it. In case of fog, they can navigate blindly by following the signals emitted by the wireless beacon stations on land and reach their destination.</p>
<p>After takeoff, the pilot's assistant can immediately put on headphones and listen to news from various places to determine the flight direction. When the weather is clear, there are various landmarks on land during the day that can guide the route. At night, there is a beacon light every ten miles to indicate the direction. At the same time, they listen to the weather at various stations along the route and send a report every ten minutes or so to report the flight situation, location, etc., to various stations, communicating information with each other. Although people are separated by land, it is like talking face to face. Unfortunately, when heavy fog descends, so that even the pilot cannot see the end of the aircraft's wings, the pilot has already learned about the impending fog and prepared everything. Therefore, they can immediately use wireless communication equipment to follow the signals from various radio beacon stations and proceed. Upon reaching the destination, they can obtain notification from the station and land safely. The usefulness of wireless communication equipment in aviation can be seen from this. Taking the aviation industry in the United States as an example, the national air routes are densely covered, like a spider web. According to a survey in the spring of 1931, land stations are equipped with 49 wireless communication beacon stations, from which one can listen to the signals and navigate in the correct direction. There are also 21 wireless communication beacon stations available for observation to meet needs, and more are still under construction.</p>
<p>Wireless communication equipment suitable for aviation can be divided into two types, A and B. Type A is installed on aircraft, and type B is used in stations. Each type is further divided into transmitting, receiving, long-wave, and short-wave.</p>
<p>The wireless communication equipment used on aircraft is very light and small, with a power of about 50 watts, and can also be used for speaking. The radio waves emitted can range from 20 meters to 50 meters. All receivers and transmitters are made with crystal tubes to ensure the accuracy of the wavelength.</p>
<p>The power source is either from a wind-powered generator or from a storage battery-powered generator. All wires are properly connected, so there is no danger of damage or loosening. For cruising aircraft, longer radio waves are used, from 200 meters to 450 meters. The wireless communication equipment installed on aircraft is placed in a place that does not interfere with piloting, and with appropriate equipment, it is protected from vibration and damage. Each aircraft is equipped with a land radio station chart placed on the right side of the seat, specifically for aviation communication, so that it can respond at any time. The perfection of the equipment and the convenience of its use can serve as a reference for our country's aviation construction.</p>
<p>It has been found that in European and American countries, the development rate of the aviation industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and the public's confidence is also increasing day by day. Safety and convenience are widely praised. After carefully examining the reasons for the safety of navigation, although the machinery is sophisticated and the talent is experienced, the wireless communication equipment has also contributed to this perfect development. From my humble point of view, in aviation construction, we should pay close attention to wireless communication equipment, because the safety of navigation and the speed of development are closely related to it. I wonder if my readers agree?</p>

<p>Yesterday Held a Propaganda Meeting</p>
<p>Today Holds a Lecture</p>
<p>On the 17th morning, melancholy clouds were deeply locked, followed by autumn rain and autumn winds, shrouding this Shanghai, filled with national crisis grief and indignation. However, amid this bleak wind and bitter rain, patriotic women did not lose heart but still participated in the China Aviation Construction Propaganda Meeting held at the Sichuan Road Youth Association. In its exhibition section, there was a real airplane manufactured by the Naval Department's Aviation Office, as well as its various parts and various small-sized airplanes. There were also hundreds of photographs of airplanes used by various countries, along with various valuable statistical charts. Five to six hundred people visited continuously. Various special issues and regulations were distributed at the exhibition site. At 4:00 PM, the opening ceremony was held. Chairman Yan Zhifang delivered the opening address, followed by Yin Zhiling's report on the association's affairs. Over six hundred guests were present and were received by Huang Jing, Yao Shoukang, Jiang Junyi, Luo Yinguo, and others. Chairman Yan Zhifang began by explaining the reasons for the establishment of the association and the significance of the urgent need for airplanes. Yin Zhiling then spoke about the association's history and the reason why previous aviation organizations had failed to develop</p>
<h3 id="e29">Wang Kai Photo Studio Took Pictures <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>The reason was that they were either biased toward the government or too narrow-minded among experts. The Aviation Construction Association takes the national public as its main body and seeks contributions in an open manner, striving to create things for the public with the power of the public. Huang Shaohong, Minister of Transportation, was originally scheduled to attend the meeting at 4:00 PM to deliver a speech. However, he was unable to attend due to important matters and sent Director Lin as his representative to speak. The general idea was that China lacks airplanes today, and even more lacks the manufacture of airplane engines. He greatly agreed with the association's educational plan. After Director Lin's speech, Wen Tiao, the representative of the Shanghai Garrison Commander, spoke, encouraging the public to work hard and participate in the aviation movement. Li Cishan then spoke, hoping that the use of airplanes in the future would be like the cars on the streets today. He hoped that the government would open up airplanes, allowing the public to have the freedom of airplanes, and then aviation could develop. Furthermore, just as there are too many criminals in cities today, the government only knows to send them to prison, where many people share a room and gain more criminal experience and knowledge. Once they are released from prison, they do even worse. It would be better to send them to remote open spaces by airplane, allowing them to make a living on their own, which would be more appropriate. Feng Shaoshan then spoke, saying that he had been away from Shanghai for a while and that recalling the bombing of Zhabei was deeply painful. In previous years, Zhang Huichang and others flew from Guangzhou to Shanghai, and various organizations warmly welcomed them. If everyone had paid attention and implemented it at that time, Chinese aviation would not still be so immature. He visited Guangxi last month, and Guangxi's national defense is now very tight. It has over a thousand miles of border with neighboring countries. He heard that the Vietnamese side recently manufactured three hundred airplanes. The Japanese used more than two hundred airplanes to deal with Shanghai, and we already felt deeply wounded. What would happen if they used three hundred airplanes against our people now? Everyone should work hard. Mr. Chu Huiseng arrived the latest, stating that we have suffered too much from Japanese airplanes. Today, we can only take the responsibility and work hard. Everyone should donate money to build airplanes so that we can relieve the national crisis. The lecture began at 8:00 PM that evening, with Zhu Lin, a design committee member of the association, giving a general explanation of aviation and showing slides. The audience was very enthusiastic. The association's lecture this afternoon will begin at 3:00 PM. The speakers will be Zeng Yijing, speaking on "The Experience of Manufacturing Airplanes in China," Qian Changzuo, speaking on "The Future Aviation National Defense Plan," and Zhang Wenzu, speaking on "Anti-Aircraft Guns." The tickets were in great demand and were not enough. In order to accommodate more listeners, it has been decided that seating will be on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

<p>Request the Government to Announce Countermeasures</p>
<p>The Shanghai-based Central Committee members telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Nanjing: The Northeast has been lost for a year. The golden bowl has been missing for a long time, and the whole country is indignant. The violent Japanese are acting recklessly, regarding our government as nothing. They brazenly recognized the puppet state and signed an agreement this month, and they intend to continue to sign various secret agreements regarding military affairs, diplomacy, and the suppression of our country's patriotic movement. They have meticulous plans and have taken decisive measures. How can this be tolerated? How can the country stand? Yet the government is still as stagnant as before. In addition to the usual protests and applications to the League of Nations to send notes to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, there are no good strategies for self-help. The so-called long-term resistance has not been seen to have any practical measures. The ambassador to Japan has mistakenly talked about direct negotiations. Summoning insult and hastening death, what shame is greater? Continuing to leave such a plan will deepen the national crisis. What kind of countermeasures will the government take against Japan's recognition of the puppet state? Is there any practical preparation for recovering the lost territory? Please quickly show the whole country with facts to dispel public doubts. The crisis of survival is imminent. We telegraph in grief and await a reply.

<p>Rather Than Sit and Wait for Death</p>
<p>It is Better to Rise Up and Fight with Blood</p>
<p>A Glimpse of National Psychology</p>
<p>The National Salvation Association's Telegram The telegram from the National People's Salvation Organizations Joint Association stated: "To the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Nanjing: The Northeast has been lost, and the mountains and rivers are broken. It began with the mistake of the non-resistance policy and continued with the mistake of trusting the League of Nations. Now it has evolved into the strange drama of the violent Japanese openly recognizing the puppet organization and signing the so-called Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. The League of Nations' investigation team's report has not yet been delivered to the League of Nations, but the violent Japanese have brazenly torn up the Nine-Power Treaty and issued a statement, trampling the League of Nations' prestige to nothing. The content of the puppet protocol includes Rehe within the four northeastern provinces and involves the Mongolian leagues and banners, revealing the plan to annex Manchuria and Mongolia as a whole. The concentration of Japanese warships along the Yangtze River is an even more blatant expression, and they will inevitably take another step to destroy us. The so-called long-term resistance, maintaining composure, and waiting for negotiations are all faults of you gentlemen who harm the country. You should not feel guilty before the gods, nor be ashamed before the Qing Yi. We hereby represent the national will and respectfully request that you quickly make a decision. On the one hand, issue an order to punish the rebels, and on the other hand, resolutely sever diplomatic relations with Japan, gather the national armed forces, and implement resistance. It is better to die quickly with recklessness than to delay and make mistakes again. We have said everything. We only hope that you will examine this carefully. The Preparatory Committee of the National People's Salvation Organizations Joint Association bows."</p>
<p>The Whampoa Anti-Japanese Corps The telegram from the Whampoa Military Academy Alumni Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps stated: "To all newspaper offices, forwarded to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: The violent Japanese, relying on force, occupied our Northeast and established a puppet state. Recently, disregarding everything, they brazenly recognized it. Name and reality are both lost, and there is no denying it. You gentlemen, entrusted with heavy responsibilities by the Party and the country, should have taken overall consideration and raised your spears against Japan. However, for a year, there has been much discussion and no practical results. One mistake after another, what is your intention? If you say that great calamities are unavoidable and there is no way to save the country, then bare your shoulders and lead the sheep, and take care of yourselves. Otherwise, act swiftly, resist the strong enemy from abroad, and punish the rebels at home, so that you can preserve the golden bowl and return our rivers and mountains. If you delay any longer, the violent Japanese will use their clever diplomatic tactics to sow discord and confuse public opinion, and the great powers will also regard us as incompetent and follow suit in recognizing the puppet state. Even if there are wise men, it will be difficult to correct the situation. All members of our corps have been in the military for a long time and have a rough understanding of tactics. We respectfully decline to participate in trivial disputes and cannot refuse to resist foreign aggression and punish rebels. We will do our best to serve. We telegraph urgently and await orders.

<p>The Federation of Labor Unions The Shanghai Federation of Labor Unions declared: "What day is today? It is the day the Northeast Three Provinces Incident occurred. A tragic day that all our compatriots should never forget until the Northeast Three Provinces are recovered. From September 18th of the 20th year to today, September 18th of the 21st year, in one year, the loss of national territory has increased, the trampling of our compatriots in the Northeast has become even worse, and the enemy's arrogance has become even greater. The more we retreat, the more they advance. Therefore, today is the day of iron-blooded battle, the day the nation fights for survival. All our compatriots should take the recovery of the Northeast as the central proposition, and no matter what their circumstances, always be consistent and steadfast in creating a national determination to resist Japan, economize on food and clothing to provide funds for the anti-Japanese war, and request that the central government vow to launch an expedition against the rebels to uphold national law and complete the territory. We hope that people from all walks of life will rise up together to plan for this. We hereby declare."</p>
<p>The Sichuan Association The Sichuan Shanghai Association telegraphed the National Government, stating: "Since the military authorities lost the Northeast Three Provinces due to the non-resistance policy, it has now been more than a year. During this year, our government authorities have often used long-term resistance and the recovery of lost territory to inform the public. However, to this day, the violent Japanese have openly recognized the puppet state and are implementing the annexation of Manchuria and Mongolia, with no regard for our country. The government's consolation to the public is still nothing more than issuing protests and declarations externally and giving speeches internally. What is even worse is that the government's responsible authorities are still fighting for power, scheming, abandoning their departments, blaming others for their mistakes, or watching from the sidelines, waiting for the opportunity for internal strife. The so-called long-term resistance and the recovery of lost territory are not only disregarded, but even forgotten. You gentlemen still have humanity, so you should also know that the revolutionary government should deal with the national crisis in this way. We are now most sadly and shamefully weeping for the government and saying: (1) Please issue a national mobilization order immediately, transfer troops from various provinces, go out of the pass to recover the lost territory, and engage in self-defense. If you think that suppressing bandits is urgent and there are no troops to transfer, for example, there are still 400,000 troops in Sichuan, prepared but unused, why not order them to the front line? (2) Please provide substantial assistance to the Northeast Volunteer Army so that they can serve as an internal response to the national army in order to drive out the Japanese invaders and eliminate the rebels as soon as possible, and allow the people to arm themselves automatically under the premise of saving the country and fighting against foreign aggression. (3) Please seriously inform the League of Nations and hold it responsible for stopping Japan's violent behavior in the Northeast by effective means in the shortest possible time, otherwise withdraw from the League of Nations immediately and freely fight against Japan, not responsible for any international treaty obligations. Some may think that with China's current strength, it is not enough to talk about this, but China is already in a state of war, and it is better to die in war than to die without war. Moreover, with the experience of the January 28th Incident, can war not lead to death? Alas, the rivers and mountains that our ancestors created with difficulty have been lost in one morning. The situation is urgent, and the country will perish soon. To be a national hero or a sinner for all time is up to you to decide. We hereby telegraph respectfully and sincerely. The Sichuan Shanghai Association, kowtow."</p>
<p>Telegram from the Chinese Women's Rights Movement League</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Rights Movement League and others telegraphed the National Government yesterday, stating: "To the National Government in Nanjing: Since the September 18th Incident, the rivers and mountains have changed color, and our hearts are deeply saddened. It began with the mistake of the non-resistance policy, continued with the mistake of begging the League of Nations for help, and then with the mistake of taking things easy. The puppet state was established, and now the violent Japanese ambition is fully revealed. Using the old trick of annexing Korea, they signed the so-called Japan-Manchukuo Protocol with the puppet state. We are extremely shocked to hear the news. We only see our government making written protests, but we have not seen it preparing with real strength to deal with the enemy. The volunteer army outside the pass is fighting with all their might to preserve the nation, shaking the mountains and turning the ditches red. The Japanese invaders are chilled by this. The only concern is the lack of supplies, and we hope that our government will provide full assistance. The League of Nations' investigation team has been in our country for a year, spending a huge amount of national treasury, and the result is just a piece of paper. The report has not yet been announced to the world. If this huge amount of money were transferred to support the volunteer army, we would have recovered our rivers and mountains long ago. In short, it is better to ask for help from ourselves than from others. Looking at the Nineteenth Route Army's resistance against the enemy with a single army, the Japanese invaders'精strong army was terrified. Now the national sentiment is boiling, and all are willing to die for the country. Our government should immediately decide on a plan to resist Japan, order the punishment of the puppet state, drive out the ugly captives, and protect the glory of our great Chinese nation. We telegraph with extreme grief. The China Philanthropic Association, the Chinese Women's Rights Movement League, the Shanghai Municipal Labor Union Joint Office, the Chinese Social Improvement Association, the Shanghai Citizens' Friendship Association, and other fourteen organizations, kowtow."</p>
<h3 id="e33">Jilin Self-Defense Army War Situation <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Published in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The Northeast has fallen for nearly a year. The people of the country share boundless grief and indignation on the anniversary of the September 18th National Humiliation. General Li Du specially instructed his representative, Wang Ziyao, to publish the war records of the Jilin Self-Defense Army's resistance against Japan in Shanghai today. A reporter from the Nichinichi Shimbun met with Mr. Wang at his residence yesterday. He was shown the original manuscript and gave an important speech, saying that the people of the Northeast, feeling the pain of losing their province and country, were sacrificing their homes to relieve the nation's difficulties everywhere. The people's morale is exceptionally high and can be used. The righteous army has fought bloody battles for years, and its loyalty and bravery have shocked China and foreign countries. As long as all parties can provide sufficient financial and material assistance, final success will surely belong to us. However, Russia's recent tacit approval of Japan transporting troops via the Chinese Eastern Railway is unfavorable to our side, which is a matter of great concern. He also said that when the Shanghai war broke out, Japan transferred Northeast troops to Shanghai. After the Shanghai war ended, they were transferred back to the Northeast. If the government had taken the opportunity to send troops to the Northeast during the Shanghai war, it would have been very easy to recover the territory. The opportunity was missed, resulting in a grave error. He couldn't help but feel deeply moved during the conversation. The original text of the war record is transcribed below:</p>
<p>January 8th, the Japanese instigated the traitorous Xi Qia's troops in Shencheng to lead two brigades of traitorous troops to attack Yushu County. Zhang Zuozhou, the brigade commander of the Northeast Infantry 10th Brigade stationed in the county, was extremely indignant that Xi Qia was willing to be a tiger's pawn. He decided to resist with all his strength. On the same day, Xing Zhanqing's brigade departed from Harbin for Yushu to assist Zhang's brigade in resisting the traitorous troops. On the 12th, Zhang and Xing's brigades came into contact with Yu's traitorous troops. Yu's troops were defeated and retreated. On the 16th, as Zhang Zuozhou and Xing Zhanqing's brigades were fiercely fighting with Yu's traitorous troops, Japanese aircraft suddenly bombed Zhang's army positions in Yushu Wuchang. Many nearby villages were destroyed. At the same time, Japanese troops from Jilin successively moved north to support the traitorous troops. On the 23rd, the troops of Feng Zhanhai, commander of the Provisional 1st Brigade, fought fiercely with Yu Shencheng's traitorous troops at Lalin Station, but unfortunately failed. On the 24th, Yu's traitorous vanguard had reached the edge of Acheng, and the main force advanced to Baicheng, 18 li away from Acheng. At that time, no less than tens of thousands of Acheng people fled to Harbin, and representatives were sent to meet with Ding Chao, the commander-in-chief of the Railway Protection Army, to request the dispatch of the Railway Protection Army to the city to maintain order. On the 25th, Li Du, the garrison commander of Yilan and commander of the 24th Brigade, heard that Yu's traitorous troops were heading north and sent troops to support Feng Zhanhai and Xing Zhanqing's troops. At 9:00 a.m. on the 26th, Li Du and Feng Zhanhai led their troops into Harbin. Li Du and Ding Chao immediately issued a joint announcement, declaring Yu Shencheng's crimes of disturbing the peace and unanimously condemning the traitors. In the afternoon, a Japanese plane scattered leaflets in Daowai, disturbing the public. General Li Du, having made up his mind to resist Japan, gathered like-minded people, united as one, and went to the national crisis together. They organized the Self-Defense Army and publicly elected Li as the commander-in-chief. Starting at 9:00 a.m. on the 27th, Feng Zhanhai's troops came into contact with the traitorous troops in the Huoyao Ku (ammunition depot) area. Li Du's army attacked from the left flank. At that time, four Japanese aircraft joined the battle, dropping bombs and firing guns. After Li Du's troops attacked from multiple directions, the traitorous troops were defeated and retreated. After Li Du recovered Harbin, the Japanese side lodged a strong protest and threatened Zhang Jinghui, demanding that the entire city of Harbin fly the Japanese flag by the 29th. Li ordered that anyone who dared to replace the Qing Tian Bai Ri (Blue Sky with a White Sun)</p>
<h2>Page 15</h2>
<p>flag would be dealt with by military law. Therefore, the merchants and residents of Harbin expressed great sympathy for Generals Li Du, Ding Chao, and Feng Zhanhai's troops. On the 28th, the Japanese army occupied the Kuanchengzi Station on the Chinese Eastern Railway, and three trains carrying Japanese soldiers advanced towards Harbin. On the 29th, Ding Chao, the commander-in-chief of the Railway Protection Army on the Chinese Eastern Railway, sent a telegram to domestic and foreign countries, detailing how the Japanese army occupied the station, shot railway workers, detained vehicles, and transported troops, violating the agreements, and that our side had no choice but to take self-defense measures. On the 30th, the Harbin-Changchun line of the Chinese Eastern Railway fell into the hands of the Japanese army. At that time, Li Du had led his troops south, reaching the Laoshaogou Station. He happened to encounter two armored trains fully loaded with Japanese soldiers from Changchun. They were head-on attacked by Li's troops, one armored train was overturned, and more than 600 enemies were annihilated. The morale of northern Manchuria was greatly boosted. Righteous armies from all over responded one after another, willing to listen to Li's command and vowing to save the country. At dawn on the 31st, the Japanese side used land and air forces to advance towards Harbin. Ding Chao's 3,000-strong Railway Protection Army engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army at Shuangchengbao, southwest of Harbin. This was followed by hand-to-hand combat, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. At that time, Xi Qia's traitorous Yu Shencheng's army concentrated in Acheng to support the enemy and contain Ding and Li's troops. Fortunately, Feng Zhanhai's troops seized a regiment of traitorous equipment in Yushulinzi, which made the traitors fearful. Other troops such as Zhao Yi and Song Wenjun had also arrived, joining forces to recapture the station. Ding specially issued a declaration stating that the responsibility for the war lay with the Japanese side. Commander-in-chief Li Du, Commander-in-chief of the Chinese Eastern Railway Protection Army Ding Chao, Frontline Commander-in-chief Wang Zhiyou, Chief of Staff Yang Yaojun, 22nd Brigade Commander Zhao Yi, 25th Brigade Commander Ma Xianzhang, 26th Brigade Commander Song Wenjun, 29th Brigade Commander Wang Ruihua, Provisional 1st Brigade Commander Feng Zhanhai, Cavalry Brigade Commander Gong Changhai, Yao Dianchen, Regiment Commander Chen Decai, and more than 30 others sent a telegram declaring their purpose of defending the country and the people, announcing it to China and foreign countries. On February 1st, after the establishment of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, the Jilin Public Security Maintenance Association was also established in terms of political affairs, with Ding Chao publicly elected as the chairman. Honjo informed Li and Ding that the Soviet Russian government did not object to the Japanese army using the Dongtie (Chinese Eastern Railway) to transport troops. On the 2nd, a large Japanese army arrived in the suburbs of Harbin, preparing for a general offensive. At that time, the troops under Ding and Li's command numbered about 14,000, deployed on both sides of Harbin, making a final stand. On the 4th, at around 8:00 a.m., two Japanese reconnaissance planes came to Harbin to scatter leaflets. At 3:00 p.m., four fighter planes came again, flying low over the governor's office and other places to show their power, and strafed artillery positions with machine guns. At the same time, they attacked Wujia Station with tanks carrying four steel cannons and 2,000 infantrymen. Commander-in-chief Li personally supervised the team's resistance. Gunfire and artillery fire were heard in the city, and stray bullets landed on the freight station. At dusk, the Japanese army retreated to the southwest. At 5:00 p.m., the Japanese Domon Division had arrived in the suburbs of Harbin. On the morning of the 5th, the enemy's land and air forces launched a fierce attack on Ding Chao's troops. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, and they finally broke through Ding's army positions. At 2:30 p.m., their left-wing troops occupied Daowai in Harbin. At 4:00 p.m., they entered Harbin and set up their headquarters on Xinshi Street. Ding and Li led their troops to retreat to the Binxian Bayan area, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. On the 8th, Li, the commander-in-chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, issued a telegram reporting the retreat from Harbin to Binxian and stated that the general headquarters had been set up in Binxian to try to recover the lost territory. On the 19th, the Japanese army sent bomber planes, reconnaissance planes, and fighter planes to bomb Ding's army in Bayan, causing heavy damage. On the 20th, Japanese planes flew to the vicinity of Binxian again and fought with the Self-Defense Army. After being countered by our army, the Japanese planes fled. The Jilin puppet governor's office convened a political meeting, designating representatives from various counties to fabricate public opinion. The Self-Defense Army occupied 12 counties, including Yilan, and issued a telegram stating that they would never recognize the puppet regime. In addition, the Self-Defense Army occupied Wuzhuhe and annihilated the local Xi Qia's traitorous troops. On the 27th, the Self-Defense Army controlled the section from Yimianpo to Suifenhe on the Hasui Line. On March 2nd, the vanguard troops of the Self-Defense Army, led by Gong Changhai, advanced to the Laoshantou area of Harbin. Harbin was in chaos, and the Japanese army urgently dispatched reinforcements. On the 3rd, Xi Qia's traitorous troops attacked Binxian. On the 5th, the Japanese Hamamoto Regiment attacked Yimianpo, and the Amano Brigade set off for Ning'an. Wang Delin's Self-Defense Army fought bravely, but eventually withdrew due to lack of ammunition. The Self-Defense Army in the Binxian area fought fiercely with the traitorous troops for two days and nights. Because the traitorous troops were supported by the Japanese army, they occupied Binxian. Commander-in-chief Li was still in the suburbs, leading troops in a fierce battle with the Japanese army for two hours. Due to being outnumbered, he had to retreat to Fangzheng. On the 6th and 7th, Wang Delin and Liu Wankui's troops attacked the Japanese army in Ning'an and Hailin separately. On the 8th, the Japanese army in Hailin was defeated and suffered countless casualties. The Japanese army retreated to Ning'an City. On the 12th, the Self-Defense Army attacked Yimianpo. The area from Yimianpo to Hengdaohezi fell into the hands of the Self-Defense Army again. On the 16th, the Self-Defense Army advanced to Shitouhezi, 60 li away from Harbin, and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army for two hours. On the 19th, Commander-in-chief Ding led his troops to attack Harbin. On the 20th, Commander-in-chief Ding led his troops back to Fangzheng to concentrate, meeting with Commander-in-chief Li. On the 25th, the Self-Defense Army captured Bincheng twice. On the 27th, Gong Changhai's troops of the Self-Defense Army engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army at Laoshantou. Feng Zhanhai's troops fought fiercely with Xi Qia's traitorous troops and the Japanese army at Gaolimaozi near Binxian. Commander-in-chief Li personally directed the battle in the area. The Japanese troops stationed in Harbin rushed to reinforce separately. Shitouhezi was surrounded by the Self-Defense Army, and Xiachengshui was recovered. On the 28th, the Self-Defense Army recovered Nong'an. The Japanese army dispatched troops to counterattack, and Changchun was under martial law. On the 29th, the traitorous troops under Yu Shencheng, Li Wenbing, Liu Baolin, and Li Yuyi, mixed with Japanese soldiers, advanced to the Huifa Dan area west of Fangzheng and engaged in a fierce battle with the Self-Defense Army's Feng Zhanhai, Gong Changhai, Yao Dianchen, and Yang Zibin's brigades for two days and nights. As a result, Yu, Li, and other troops suffered a disastrous defeat, and most of them surrendered. On the 30th, because the Japanese army lost Nong'an and Yu's traitorous troops suffered a disastrous defeat, they urgently transferred the brigade stationed in Korea back to cooperate with the Amano and Hasebe brigades and various traitorous troops to attack Nong'an. On April 1st, the Japanese army launched a general offensive on Nong'an. Xi Qia and the Jilin Railway Garrison were on the right wing, attacking the east of Nong'an. The Japanese Shimizu and Kuroishi troops and the Fengtian Garrison were on the front, attacking the southeast. Zhang Haipeng was on the left wing, cooperating in attacking the southeast. A certain unit of the traitorous army attacked the north of Nong'an, adopting an encirclement formation. All the Japanese planes were dispatched to participate in the battle. The Self-Defense Army's Li Haiqing's troops concentrated their main force north of Liujianfang, taking a strategic position. The battle began, and the artillery fire was extremely fierce. On the 2nd, there were fierce battles in Dajianfang, Changanbao, Niuluotun, and other areas south of Nong'an. They fought with flesh and blood, and the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties. The traitorous army counterattacked Fangzheng, Yimianpo, and Weishahe, and there were battles in all these areas. On the 3rd, the Self-Defense Army's Li Haiqing and other troops in Nong'an suffered heavy losses due to the threat of Japanese planes and the suppression of artillery fire, and the rear roads were cut off. They had no choice but to retreat to Fuyu. On the 4th, the Japanese army entered Nong'an again, and Yu Shencheng's various traitorous troops counterattacked Fangzheng and fought fiercely at Gaolimaozi. Yu's troops retreated towards Binxian, and Feng Zhanhai's army tracked and pursued them. Most of Yu's troops surrendered. Li Wenbing's traitorous army was defeated by Gong Changhai, and more than half were captured. Wang Delin's troops, in conjunction with the militia, attacked Yanji. At the same time, Wang divided a part of his troops to capture Ning'an. On the 5th, the Japanese army, because Yu's traitorous troops failed to attack Fangzheng, used planes, heavy artillery, and tanks to launch a fierce attack on Fangzheng. The key points were all destroyed, and the Japanese army approached the city. The Self-Defense Army fought back in close combat. Japanese planes dropped hundreds of bombs into the city, and fires broke out in various streets. The Japanese army, together with Yu's traitorous troops, launched a siege from all directions. The Self-Defense Army was attacked on all sides and had no choice but to make a general retreat, with most of them withdrawing to Yilan. On the 6th, the Northeast rebels recognized the land lease rights of foreigners, stipulating a lease term of 30 years. On the 7th, Japanese planes bombed Yilan, and many civilian houses were destroyed, but they were repelled by anti-aircraft guns. Wang Delin's troops occupied the four counties of Yanji, Hunchun, Wangqing, and Helong. The National Crisis Conference held a review meeting and sent a telegram of condolences to Generals Li Du and Ding Chao. On the 11th, the remnants of the Hasui Line were cleared, and the war focused on Yanji and Hunchun. On the 12th, Chairman Ma Zhanshan sent a telegram to Commander-in-chief Li, saying that he had arrived in Heihe to cooperate in the offensive. On the 13th, a Japanese military train derailed in the suburbs of Harbin, killing and wounding more than a hundred people. On the 14th, the Self-Defense Army recovered Weishahe. On the 15th, the Self-Defense Army captured Fangzheng. On the 17th, the area between Yimianpo and Suifenhe came under the control of the Self-Defense Army.

On the 26th, the Japanese Murakami Brigade attacked Shitouhezi and was surrounded by the Self-Defense Army, suffering heavy casualties. On the 27th, three Japanese mixed brigades set off for eastern Jilin. On the 28th, the Japanese army occupied Hailin, and the Self-Defense Army recovered Fuyu. On the 29th, the Self-Defense Army and Ma Zhanshan jointly attacked Harbin. On the 30th, Wang Delin counterattacked from Hailun. The Japanese army could not resist and retreated to the Wuji Mihe River. On May 2nd, the Japanese army at the Wumi River was defeated and retreated to Harbin. On the 3rd, the Self-Defense Army recovered Zhuhe and Binxian. On the 4th, the Japanese army went straight down the Mudanjiang River and attacked Yilan. The Self-Defense Army resisted fiercely. Soon, Yu Shencheng and other traitorous troops also joined the co-attack. The artillery fire was continuous, and the losses were too heavy. They had no choice but to abandon Yilan. On the 7th, the Self-Defense Army divided into two routes to approach Harbin. On the 11th, Japan transferred the 14th Division in Shanghai to the Northeast. A total of one division was transferred.

<h3 id="e34">Japanese Military Authorities <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Implement Special Martial Law</p>
<p>Joint Announcement to Japanese Residents</p>
<p>Do Not Go Out for Three Days</p>
<p>The Japanese residents in Shanghai originally planned to hold a so-called "Invasion of Manchuria Commemoration" celebration at Hongkou Park at 2:00 p.m. today. However, the Japanese military and political authorities, in view of the high morale of our people and fearing the recurrence of a grenade incident, repeatedly jointly advised the Japanese residents to stop the gathering. Although the Japanese residents expressed their acceptance, they still intended to hold celebrations separately in their respective locations. However, Japanese Naval Commander Sakonji and Marine Corps Commander Sugita issued emergency orders yesterday, implementing special martial law in the areas where Japanese residents lived, implementing checks on pedestrians, and also strongly preventing Japanese residents from going out. The various news items are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Implement Special Martial Law Today is the anniversary of the September 18th National Humiliation. The Japanese military and political authorities stationed in Shanghai, in view of the high morale of our people, urgently ordered the subordinate troops to implement special martial law at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. All the naval marines went ashore and were densely deployed in the Japanese residential area along North Sichuan Road in Hongkou, and the number of patrolmen was increased from eight to fourteen, patrolling every half an hour. At the same time, machine gun teams and armored vehicle teams were also ordered to patrol. The Japanese police force was responsible for protecting Japanese merchants and factories, and also implemented strict inspections on Chinese people passing through the Japanese residential area.</p>
<p>Announcement by the Japanese Military Commander The Japanese Naval Commander Sakonji and Marine Corps Commander Sugita jointly issued an urgent announcement to the Japanese residents yesterday, saying, "Regarding the urgent announcement, today is the September 18th Memorial Day. The Chinese people attach great importance to this festival, and the people's morale is extremely high. The commander is responsible for the safety of the Japanese residents and should strengthen the protection of the safety of our people. However, the scope of protection is limited to the areas where our people live. Therefore, we jointly announce that all residents must not go out freely from today until the 21st, or go beyond the scope of protection of this commander. Otherwise, if an accident occurs, they will be responsible for their own actions. This commander will not be responsible. We hereby solemnly announce."</p>
<h3 id="e35">After Japan Recognizes the Puppet Organization <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>It Will Complete Its Manchuria-Mongolia Policy</p>
<p>Talks with Guests from Outside the Pass</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that the Japanese imperialists, defying the world's condemnation and destroying the universally recognized Nine-Power Treaty, officially announced their recognition of the Manchurian puppet government they had created single-handedly on the 15th, regardless of everything. The Japanese, using the old trick of destroying Korea, sent their plenipotentiary envoy, in the style of the resident-general who destroyed Korea, who immediately signed various treasonous treaties with the puppet organization upon entering the eastern province. From then on, the three eastern provinces no longer belong to us, and the 30 million compatriots outside the pass are the slaves of the enemy's iron hooves, just like Korea and Taiwan. Yesterday, a gentleman who returned from the eastern province told the reporter in a friendly manner that Japan's ambition after recognizing the puppet organization was very detailed. I am recording it to promote the awakening of the people at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Complete Manchuria-Mongolia For decades, Japan has been painstakingly planning and actively pursuing its Manchuria-Mongolia policy. After the three northeastern provinces fell into the hands of the Japanese army, they first used shameless rebellious traitors and villains to establish the so-called Manchurian government, and on the other hand, they coveted Mongolia very much. Looking at the recent publication of absurd declarations, the word "Mongolia" must be written under the word "Manchuria." Therefore, the Manchuria-Mongolia policy is now the only task of the Japanese in invading China.</p>
<p>Attack Rehe in October After the Japanese completed the first step of their so-called new lifeline by recognizing Manchuria, they will inevitably attack the Rehe issue in the near future. One is to complete Manchuria-Mongolia, and the other is to cut off the news between inside and outside the pass to cover the world's ears and eyes. According to recent observations of the situation, the Japanese side is scheduled to send troops to attack Rehe in October. From the Japanese army's point of view, it will definitely be able to obtain Rehe without any problems.</p>
<p>Manipulate Finance Since Japan seized the Northeast on September 18 last year, it has spared no effort to manipulate finance. On the one hand, it urgently resumes financial businesses such as the Bianye Bank and the Three Eastern Provinces Official Bank, and establishes another puppet central bank to unify the currency system of the three eastern provinces, manipulate the business of various banks, and collect the banknotes issued by various banks in the three provinces by the central bank. The bank issues banknotes to enforce the passage of the three provinces. According to the Japanese plan, the finances of the three provinces can be completely straightened out in two years. The Japanese ambition to manipulate the finances of the three eastern provinces can also be seen.</p>
<p>Train Manchurian Soldiers Mr. said that the newspapers at home and abroad reported a few days ago.</p>
<p>The puppet military and political department of the puppet "Manchukuo" is sorting out the policy of 130,000 troops of the "Manchukuo" army, which is scheduled to be divided into three phases, but there is something unfinished. Now, no matter where the provincial fortresses are outside the pass, they are guarded by Japanese soldiers. According to recent statistics, there are more than 80,000 Japanese troops in Manchuria, while the so-called "Manchukuo" army is only about 40,000. According to reliable news a few days ago, Japan decided to instigate the puppet military department to recruit 300,000 troops, divided into 20 divisions. In addition to the original reorganization, all guns and equipment are supplied by the Japanese side, and the training period is set at two years. This plan can be implemented next spring.</p>
<p>Launch a Large-Scale Invasion of China Two years later, Japan's finances in the eastern provinces can be consolidated, and the so-called 300,000 Manchurian soldiers trained can be used to attack us. What is most shocking to our people is that the puppet Puyi will carry out a further absurd undertaking at this time, that is, to announce the reasons and process of his abdication, the reasons for organizing the puppet country, and to publish a statement of reinstatement. At this time, if any party comes out to resist, Puyi will immediately send troops to invade. If the various parties inside the pass do not have strict precautions, the future of China will be unimaginable.</p>

<p>At about 12:00 noon yesterday, a young man in a western suit, about twenty years old, suddenly came to the Fu Xiang Ji yarn and thread general store at No. 71 to 73, opposite the big clock on the road of the French Concession. He walked into the store door and immediately claimed to be a member of the Red Blood Assassination Corps. Because he found out that your store was buying and selling Japanese goods, he came here to offer a bomb. He immediately took out a round bomb, as big as a ball, and threw it into the store hall, but it did not explode. However, everyone in the store was pale and had no way to escape. The young man also took the opportunity to leave. The store owner, Fu Yiyan from Ningbo, urgently reported the incident to the police station opposite the big clock and removed the bomb. Afterwards, various newspapers received letters from the Red Blood Assassination Corps, saying that the store sold sock machines and yarn. When they entered the market, they had no brand, and when they left the market, they added the brand at any time to deceive their compatriots, so they were warned.</p>

A telegram has been sent to request the dispatch of personnel for inspection. According to the resolutions of your committee, the post-disaster construction of each section includes 113.2 feet of the main engineering work of two rows of three stones south of the阅兵台 reviewing platform, 130 feet of the cement wall of the 道堂廟 Daotang Temple to the north and south, 80 feet north and south of Yanglinkou, 50 feet east of Xuliujingkou, and the extension of the main engineering work includes 15 feet south of the阅兵台 reviewing platform, 7 feet south of the cement wall of the 道堂廟 Daotang Temple, 5 feet south of Yanglinkou, and 3 feet west of Xuliujingkou, for a total of 403.2 feet, as well as the repair of the stone beach slope of the 道堂廟 Daotang Temple cement wall section, and the addition of 92 feet of subsidiary embankments, and the construction of a total of 12 feet of cast stone walls for the north and south headlands, and the repair of 105 feet of the stone beach slope of the Fangjiayan cement wall section. All military destruction, including the repair of 370 feet of old桩石 pile stones, and the filling of trenches and artillery holes, and other projects, have been actively carried out since the start of construction in June. After careful consideration of the dangerous conditions on the ground and assessing the surplus of materials and labor, adjustments and additions were made to several projects. The additions include extending the main engineering work by 1.9 feet south of the阅兵台 reviewing platform, adding a row of second-layer 丈八桐 zhangbatong tung wood piles 23.5 feet long to the south main engineering work of the 道堂廟 Daotang Temple due to the particularly low beach surface, adding a row of one-row-of-piles-of-stones engineering work 6 feet long at the gap behind the south headland main engineering work of the cement wall, adding 2.5 feet of stone beach slope to the Fangjiayan cement wall section, 10 feet of the old桩石 pile stone second beach slope, and organizing 42.5 feet of the first layer, 48 feet of the outer stone slope of the cement wall section, and adding a row of sparse pile nailed plank engineering work 10 feet long at the west gap of Xuliujingkou, and repairing the old pile stone engineering work, including 8 feet at the Taojia mouth angle, 24 feet at the north pier of the阅兵台 reviewing platform, and using 100 originally stored麻袋 hemp sacks to organize a total of 930 feet of the seawall surface of each section.

<h3 id="e42">An American Woman <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Protests Additional Telephone Charges</p>
<p>Jester's Opinion</p>
<p>Yesterday, an American woman, signing as "An American Woman" (一美人), sent a letter to the North China Daily News, stating that the Shanghai Telephone Company's increase in telephone charges had been approved by the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the French Concession's Board of Directors. There seems to be no way to oppose it publicly. However, in my opinion, it seems resistible that the company is seeking to recover the increased fees retroactively. The company provides telephone service to users based on a certain contract. If users do not want to pay the fees, they can choose not to use the telephone. However, now the company not only wants to increase telephone charges from a certain date but also wants to retroactively collect past telephone charges together. If a user's check does not match the company's bill and includes the increased past telephone charges, it will be returned by the company with a notice stating that it cannot be accepted. The company intends that if the retroactively charged telephone fees are not paid immediately, service will be suspended. I believe that there is more than just me who thinks that this should be taken up with the US Consul General in Shanghai. Therefore, I especially suggest that users can jointly refuse to pay the retroactively increased telephone fees. If the company is determined to suspend service, then they can jointly take legal action, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Explosion of Industrial Raw Materials <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Worker Flies to the Third Floor</p>
<p>Falls Down and Dies Tragically with Brain Matter Splattered</p>
<p>Two Other Workers Severely Injured</p>
<p>丨Police Rigorously Investigate the Cause of the Accident丨</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a tragic explosion of industrial raw materials occurred in the Pu'an Lane of Xin Yong'an Street in the French Concession. Two people were seriously injured, and another was blasted to the third floor, then fell down, dying with brain matter splattered. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials Company: The Hua Feng Industrial Materials Company, located at No. 5, Pu'an Lane, No. 63 Xin Yong'an Street, French Concession, is established by Cantonese merchants. It specializes in various industrial raw materials and has been in business for nearly ten years. The manager is Lin Dafu from Zhejiang, 30 years old. The chairman of the board is Xie Lilin from Guangdong. Another branch is located in Laoximen, in the Chinese area.</p>
<p>Huge Explosion Sound: At around 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a huge explosion suddenly occurred in the company's courtyard, shaking the surrounding area. Not long after, an ambulance from the Haige Road Red Cross Hospital arrived and carried away three people who looked like young workers. They were covered in blood and unbearable to look at. At the same time, the French police, upon hearing the news, dispatched detectives to investigate. They saw that most of the glass windows in the house were shattered. In the courtyard, there were two sturdy empty steel barrels, about four feet high and two feet in diameter. The top of one barrel had been blown open, while the other had not been opened.</p>
<p>Cause of the Steel Barrel Explosion: According to the company's staff, they had purchased two steel barrels from somewhere in Pudong a few days ago, intending to fill them with ammonia raw materials.</p>
<p>Lin (from Shaoxing, 28 years old), Yang Guojun (local, 26 years old), and rickshaw puller Li A'er (from Jiangbei, 30 years old), and two others opened a silver dollar-sized opening in the middle of the barrel. Unexpectedly, the lid was difficult to pry open due to rust. Yang Guojun then used kerosene to burn the lid open and ordered Wang Jinlin to stand on the barrel. As soon as it caught fire, the empty barrel suddenly exploded.</p>
<p>Blasted to the Third Floor: With a loud boom, Yang and Li fell to the ground at the same time. The unfortunate Wang Jinlin was blasted to the third floor, then fell to the ground, shattering his brain. Li A'er suffered severe injuries to his waist, legs, face, and other parts, and his life is feared to be in danger. Only Yang Guojun suffered minor injuries and is not in danger of death, etc. However, according to the results of the police investigation, the stated reasons are not very sufficient. If the barrel did not contain explosives, it would not have exploded for no reason. Therefore, a thorough investigation is still needed.</p>
<p>Sulfur Odor on the Corpse: Wang Jinlin, who was seriously injured, died en route while being transported by ambulance. The Red Cross notified the police, who then instructed the Tongren Fuyuan funeral home to send a hearse to transport the body to the morgue, awaiting examination by the Second Special District Court today. The reporter personally saw Wang's corpse, wearing a white cloth shirt and pants, a black short jacket, a white silk waistband, black socks, and black leather shoes. He was bald, and a bullet had entered from his left eye socket, piercing his occipital bone. He had a pair of glasses and several copper coins in his pocket. A felt hat was left beside him. There was no information about his family. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan morgue, awaiting examination by the Second Special District Court today. The reporter personally saw Wang's corpse. He was wearing a white cloth shirt and pants, with a black short jacket, a white silk waistband, black socks, and black leather shoes. He was bald and barefoot. His face was blasted black, and his facial features were almost unrecognizable. His left thumb was severed. The scene was unbearable to witness, and his body was still full of the smell of sulfur.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Sanyou Factory Workers Again on Hunger Strike Yesterday <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>After the management of the Sanyou Factory in Yinxing Port, Hudong, stopped providing meal allowances, it caused panic among all workers. Yesterday, the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union still sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to collect funds, and sent representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition the Eighth Municipal Congress. The workers staying at the Shanghai Hospital have continued their hunger strike. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meal Allowances Still Not Received: At 10:00 AM yesterday, six representatives from the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union, including Xia Zhongzhao, Qin Haiyan, Qin Changgeng, Bao Boyi, Wu Renfu, and Zhang Tingliang, went to the Social Affairs Bureau to collect meal allowances. They were received by Xu Yefu, Chief of the Third Section of the Bureau, who stated that the authorities would adopt effective measures to resolve the issue of worker meal allowances and were confident that they would be able to collect the funds soon and that there would be no further delays.</p>
<p>Workers Continue Hunger Strike: Hong Jiaben and eighteen others declared a continuation of their hunger strike at the Labor Hospital yesterday morning. They also sent a letter to Dean Fan of the hospital. Upon learning of this, Fan personally comforted and urged them to eat, but the workers were determined and politely refused. The hospital has reported to the Party and government authorities to request instructions. In addition, six workers staying at the Shanghai Hospital, including Li Hongde, Yang Xiutang, Huang Lizhong, You Junqing, Zhu Jinsheng, and Ni A'hai, upon learning of the hunger strike of their fellow workers at the Labor Hospital, also declared a unanimous hunger strike yesterday morning. The situation is very tragic, and the hospital doctors and nurses all sighed.</p>
<p>Worker Commits Suicide and Dies: Cai Xiqing, a sewing department worker at the factory, was 31 years old and from Jiaxing. He had a wife and five children, and their livelihood depended entirely on his work. Since the January 28th Incident, the factory announced a shutdown, and he lost his livelihood. He sent his family back to his hometown and returned to Shanghai. Because the factory still had no intention of resuming work, and he still had to support his family, he had no choice but to ask a friend to introduce him as a temporary worker at the Times Store in Nanshi, hoping that the factory would resume work. However, months passed, and there was still no hope of resuming work. Recently, he received a letter from his family requesting living expenses. Feeling his dire circumstances, he became pessimistic and attempted suicide. On the night of the 15th of this month (the Mid-Autumn Festival), he locked himself in his room and lay down alone. His colleagues in the store did not suspect anything. It was not until the day before yesterday (the 16th) that he was discovered, having taken poison. His brother, Zhiqing, immediately took him to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment, but the poisoning was too severe, and he died yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>Land Dispute on Jiangshun Steamer Reported Separately</p>
<p>No Police Officers Fired Shots, No Japanese Military Interference</p>
<p>Letter: The Water Patrol Headquarters sent a letter to this newspaper, stating, Respectfully, in the local news column of your newspaper on the 17th of this month, there was an article stating that Water Patrol police officers fired shots on the Jiangshun steamer due to confiscating two packages of soil, which led to the Japanese Navy boarding the ship and interfering with the water police. After reading it, I was very surprised. This case occurred at around 9:00 PM on the 13th of this month. Several detectives confiscated nine packages of opium soil (not two packages) on the Jiangshun steamer and sent them to the team for investigation. At that time, no police officers fired shots, and no Japanese Navy came to interfere. The information in your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts. Here is a copy of the original text of the report submitted to the Public Security Bureau regarding this case. Please correct it immediately. Sincerely, the Water Patrol Headquarters of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, September 17. Attached is a copy of the original report submitted by this team to the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Report: The Water Patrol Headquarters reported to the Director of the Bureau, stating that at 9:50 PM on the 13th of this month, detectives Wu Chengxian and Shen Hexun reported that they saw a sampan parked outside the Jiangshun steamer at the Jinliyuan Pier, unloading a burlap sack. The behavior was suspicious. When they were about to confiscate it, people from the steamer suddenly hoisted the unloaded burlap sack back onto the ship. They did not have time to report back to the team and dispatched police officers to assist in the arrest. They chased the people to the ship's boiler room, where twenty or thirty people who looked like boiler room workers closed them in the room, surrounded them, and beat them. Detective Wu Chengxian's head was broken, and his handgun, number 11358, was taken away. Later, they captured Xu Caiyun from among the assailants and brought Xu Caiyun and the remaining small burlap sack of opium soil on the sampan back to the team, reporting for verification and seizure. Patrol Officer Pan Xiutong was dispatched, leading police chief Zhang Kefeng and police officers Bian Chunlin, Liu Jinfu, Xue Jinzhong, Sun Guozhong, Liu Jinshan, Xu Jinfu, and Song Deyun, etc., to the ship. They brought three stokers from the ship's boiler room back to the team for verification. Upon questioning, Xu Caiyun and the stokers Qian Jiting, Qian Genfa, and Zhu A'bao all gave evasive and untruthful answers. The case involves opium smuggling and assaulting public officials. They should be presented together with the witnesses and a medical certificate. Respectfully presented to the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. Attached is a list of those presented: Xu Caiyun, 37 years old, from Ningbo, is the third boss on the Jiangshun steamer. Qian Jiting, 32 years old, Qian Genfa, 28 years old, Zhu A'bao, 38 years old, all from Ningbo, are stokers on the Jiangshun steamer. Evidence: One small burlap sack of opium soil, containing nine packages, weighing a total of 550 taels, and one medical certificate.</p>

Our company, on this occasion of the September 18th National Humiliation Anniversary, is saddened by the loss of our territory and pained by the suffering of the refugees. Therefore, in addition to a one-tenth contribution from the salaries of all employees this month to provide relief, we will also allocate one-tenth of the revenue from our frugal retail sales from September 18th to 22nd to aid the Northeastern refugees. Our company is willing to sacrifice these five days' profits to help the refugees, but the amount raised during these five days, whether large or small, depends on the enthusiasm of our customers. We specially request your esteemed editor to vigorously promote this, and hope that our compatriots in Shanghai, who are well-fed and warmly clothed, will not forget the hunger and cold suffered by our Northeastern compatriots who have been displaced from their homes. We hope they will come and enthusiastically purchase our goods, which will not only alleviate the suffering of the Northeastern refugees but also obtain inexpensive, high-quality domestic products and prevent the outflow of China's interests. This is truly a single act with three benefits. Furthermore, our company is currently striving to increase production of the new 'Big Star' products to resist foreign goods. During this period of great frugality, we are making efforts to promote our products, even at the cost of sacrifice. On this day of the National Humiliation Anniversary, we must do our utmost to support the Northeastern refugees by taking the lead. We sincerely hope that our fellow domestic manufacturers will follow suit and jointly provide relief, so that more funds can be raised. Perhaps, by gathering individual efforts, we can achieve great things, and by accumulating grains of sand, we can build a tower. Our company will kowtow three times and bow nine times to thank our Northeastern compatriots. Sincerely, Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory Co., Ltd."</p>

<p>Registration Slips Should Bear Revenue Stamps</p>
<p>Xu Zhicheng, Director of the Jiangsu Shangbao Revenue Stamp Bureau, sent a letter yesterday to various medical organizations, which begins as follows: "Greetings. Our bureau is now under the provincial bureau's order to urge and supervise tax collection with stricter assessments. All business documents that should bear revenue stamps but have not been stamped should be strictly enforced to increase tax revenue. Most formally licensed medical practitioners in our country are patriotic and enthusiastic individuals. When providing consultations to patients and collecting fees, the registration slips used are a type of monetary receipt. According to Article 2, Category 1, Item 13 of the Revenue Stamp Regulations, stamps should be affixed at the rate of one cent for amounts of one yuan or more but less than ten yuan, and two cents for amounts of ten yuan or more. Amounts less than one yuan are exempt from stamping. This will legalize the business documents and fulfill the obligation to respect national taxes. Your esteemed association is a legal entity in the medical community and understands the overall situation. We hereby inform you and request you to assist in notifying all medical practitioners to affix revenue stamps to registration slips in accordance with monetary receipts starting from the 16th of this month to maintain national taxes. We hope you will vigorously promote this and respond promptly."</p>

<p>Sends Chen Shunyun to Tianjin to Assist in Inspection Administration</p>
<p>The Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau mainly inspects livestock. In order to improve livestock inspection, the bureau has been approved by the Ministry of Industry to transfer Cheng Shaojiong, a technical officer from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, to serve as the Director of the Livestock Inspection Department of the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau. Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Bureau, obeyed the order of the Ministry but considered that Cheng Shaojiong's position in the bureau, overseeing the manufacture of foot-and-mouth disease serum, was important, and his departure might cause a standstill due to a lack of replacement. However, the Tianjin Bureau needed to improve livestock inspection urgently. To balance both sides, it was decided to send Chen Shunyun, Director of the Livestock Production Fermentation Department of the Shanghai Bureau, to Tianjin temporarily for three months to assist, and then return to the Shanghai Bureau after the term. Chen is scheduled to depart for Tianjin on the 20th to assist with all matters.</p>

<p>Sends Special Commissioner to Shanghai to Raise Relief Funds</p>
<p>The Exchange Association Generously Donates 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Qu County, Zhejiang, is located at the border of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. Since the insurgency of Fang and Shao bandits in eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian, refugees from various counties in eastern Jiangxi, such as Guangfeng, Shangrao, Guixi, and Yiyang, have flocked to Qu County, reaching several thousand. Initially, they still had some valuables to pawn, but recently they have been running out of resources. Those with several thousand dan of grain at home have been labeled as landlords by the Red Bandits and have been deprived of everything. Those with several sons who graduated from universities are now hiding in dilapidated temples, supported by their wives, concubines, and daughters begging for food. The wives, concubines, and daughters, accustomed to pampered lives, are ashamed to go out and often spend the entire day without getting a full meal. The county magistrate of Qu County, Wu Bokang, considering the hunger and cold of the refugees to be pitiable and recognizing that a failure to properly resettle them would inevitably lead to disturbances in local security, has specially requested Wang Hantao, the Ninth District County Administration Supervisor, to solicit donations from all parties. It is reported that Wang recently came to Shanghai and invited philanthropists and Jiangxi natives in Shanghai to a vegetarian meal at the Gongdelin Restaurant. Wang Yiting, Mu Ouchu, Zhao Jinqing, Qu Wenliu, Wang Rutang, Wang Xiaolai, Chu Huizeng, Zhang Shenzhi, Tao Xingru, Niu Yuanbo, Xu Hexuan, and others attended. Wang Yiting and Mu Ouchu, representing the Exchange Association, generously donated 1,000 yuan in silver. Zhao Jinqing also donated 100 yuan in silver on behalf of the China Sports Advancement Association, which was paid on the spot. The other philanthropists also promised to do their best to solicit donations, hoping that all sectors of society, mindful of the Red Bandits' ferocity and cruelty and the refugees' displacement, would enthusiastically contribute to save them from the floods.</p>

<p>Neighbors Nearby Frequently Heard Her Crying</p>
<p>Yang Laowu, a native of Tongzhou, and his wife, Yang Tan, who reside at No. 767 Rongshou Lane, Avenue Edouard VII, are very cruel and abuse their eleven-year-old niece, Tan Lindi, all day long, causing her to be covered in wounds and depriving her of sleep, making her sit up all night.

<p>356 Ounces of Opium Seized</p>
<p>Seven Months Imprisonment and 50 Yuan Fine</p>
<p>On September 8th at 10:50 AM, Hu Dewang, a native of Henan, hired rickshaw No. 949 at the Jianghai Customs Wharf on the Bund, Fuzhou Road, to carry 41 brooms to Avenue Foch, French Concession.

Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court interrogated Hu Dewang. Hu Dewang insisted that two men in Zhongshan suits had entrusted him to carry them. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi, based on various circumstances, determined that Hu was the principal offender in the opium trafficking and requested that he be severely punished in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law. After deliberation, Judge Feng sentenced Hu Dewang to seven months of imprisonment and a fine of 50 yuan for assisting others in attempting to sell and possessing opium. The number of days of detention before the final judgment will be used to offset the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The opium and brooms were confiscated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Both Were Rescued</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, two men, coincidentally, boarded ships at the Xinguang Pier one after another and attempted to drown themselves in the river. Both were due to economic hardship. Fortunately, they were rescued and did not drown. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>No Face to Live: Xiao Xinyuan, a native of Hunan, 30 years old, used to run a hotel in Shanghai. Due to poor business, he lost money and closed down. He has been unemployed for several years. This year, he suddenly suffered from pain in both feet. After borrowing more than 20 yuan from his uncle, he finally sought medical treatment and cured his foot pain. The other day, a friend invited him to seek work in Pinghu. Xiao, feeling ashamed to go to Pinghu because his clothes were old and worn, became ashamed and angry. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, he took the No. 11 ferry from Xinguang Pier to the other side of the river. When the ship reached the center of the river, he jumped into the water to end his life. The boatman, Fan Jinlong, immediately took measures to rescue him and sent him to the Customs Water Police Station. He confessed his situation and said that his uncle's name was Deng Youqing and that he worked at the Wanyuan Xiang Embroidery Shop in Huajin Lane, Hankou Road, and that his mother, Deng, also lived there. The police station dispatched Chinese detective Ge Changsheng to summon his mother, Xiao Deng, to the police station to take her son home.</p>
<p>Lacking Funds to Return Home: Shao Qiuzi, a native of Yongjia, Zhejiang, 24 years old, is a tailor. He used to work in a shop in Nanjing, but recently he stopped working due to some reason. On the 12th of this month, he took a train to Shanghai to find friends. After several days, he had not found them. His money ran out, and all his belongings were pawned. Seeing that he was at his wit's end, he wanted to return home, but he did not have a penny. He became weary of the world. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, he also went to the Xinguang Pier and boarded a ferry to the other side of the river. When the ship reached the center of the river, he jumped into the water to end his life. Fortunately, the crew rescued him and sent him to the Water Police Station. Seeing that his situation was pitiful, the police station dispatched Chinese detective Ge Changsheng to send him to the Wenzhou Native Place Association to find a way to send him back home.</p>

<p>Cai Xiqing, 31 years old, a native of Jiangsu residing at No. 25 Yili Street, Penglai Market, Penglai Road, Nanshi, worked for a foreign company. A few days ago (the 16th), he celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival at home, inviting relatives and friends to a feast. He was in high spirits. After three rounds of drinks, Cai, as the host, initiated a drinking game. However, Cai's alcohol tolerance was not high. After drinking a few glasses, he became intoxicated. Before long, he vomited non-stop. His family helped him to the inner room to rest. After the guests finished their meals, they played mahjong. At 4:00 or 5:00 PM, Cai's drunkenness not only did not subside but also became accompanied by groaning and abdominal pain. At first, they suspected that he had cholera and treated him with Huoxiang Zhengqi liquid and other medicines, but it was ineffective. They then took him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was to no avail. He died yesterday. According to the doctor, it was feared that he had mistakenly ingested a poisonous substance.</p>

<p>Judge: Car Owner Should Provide Compensation Quickly</p>
<p>Lv Aqiao, one of the two drivers of a truck owned by the Hulisheng Coal Company on Jiaxing Road, drove truck No. 18361 on the 10th of this month at 8:45 AM on East Seward Road near the No. 7 tram stop near Huaji Road. The driver accidentally knocked down Yi Jishan, 30 years old, a fellow villager who worked for a customs broker and resided at No. 3224 Puan Lane, Zhoujiazui Road. He was sent to Tongren Hospital by Chinese detective Zhao Ruisheng, but he died of his injuries at about 10:00 AM the next morning. Lv Aqiao was taken to the First Special District Court by the Wayside Police Station. Lv claimed that there was a collapsed car obstructing the road at the time, causing him to knock down the deceased. He was detained for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong opened the Criminal Court No. 4 for the trial. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the investigation revealed that the defendant had taken the wrong route at the time, causing the accident. He asked that he be prosecuted. Qin Rongjun, a Korean tram ticket inspector on the No. 7 tram, testified that he saw the defendant's car not following the route. Liu Yao, the wife of the deceased, testified that her husband worked at a customs broker with a monthly salary of more than 20 yuan, leaving behind an eight-year-old son and that she was several months pregnant. At that time, her husband had left home to go to the office and suffered this misfortune. The owner of the coal company, the defendant, had asked someone to mediate and was willing to provide compensation of 1,250 yuan, but it had not been received yet. Chen Xinren, the representative of the coal company, said that the amount had been agreed upon by the deceased's wife and the owner of the coal company, Hu Lisheng, and that it could be paid this afternoon. The court declared to him that the deceased's wife was now widowed and helpless, and that the amount should be enough to support her for the rest of her life. He urged the owner not to break his promise. Chen agreed. Judge Shen ordered the defense to begin the debate and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody. The sentencing date was set.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Having read in today's (16th) newspaper that the village of Wangjiajing in Jiaotong Road sent a representative, Hou Xuanqing, to petition the Railway Bureau, after investigation, this is absolutely not the case. On that day, Mr. Hou visited me with a business card identifying him as a reporter from Datong News Agency. I only received him as a newspaper reporter, and Mr. Hou did not mention representing the villagers to petition, nor did he present a petition. The so-called "representing the villagers to petition" in the newspaper is obviously completely inconsistent with the facts at the time. Fearing that there may be ulterior motives, I am writing to request that you correct the record to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Ding Zhenheng, Secretary's Office, Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways, September 17th.</p>

<h3 id="e80">National Salvation Cannot Be Achieved by Empty Words - Letter from the Minister of Education to Students Across the Country <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Commemorating September 18th</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th - Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua released a letter to students across the country on September 17th for the September 18th commemoration. The writing is elegant, from the pen of an old scholar. It concluded that national salvation cannot be achieved by shouting and jumping around, but only by empty words.</p>
<p>Nanjing - Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua's original text of the letter to students across the country for the September 18th commemoration is as follows: Time flies. It has been a year since the Japanese invaders spied on the border and the Eastern Provinces were lost to foreign lands. The lives of the people are trapped in water and fire, suffering hardships. Those who have died from displacement and from the sword can be counted in the tens of thousands. On the banks of Songhu and in the territory of Nenjiang, the sky is dark and the rain is wet, and the new ghosts are full of resentment. Indeed, it is a strange humiliation for the country, and the hatred is so deep that it makes one gnash one's teeth. The Eastern Provinces, in ancient times, were the territories of You and Qing prefectures. The north was the old land of the Sushen clan. When the Zhou Dynasty had virtue, its tribute of withered arrows was recorded in the past annals and spread as a beautiful tale. Since then, establishments have been established as prefectures and counties, and no inch of land is not our soil, and no one is not our people. In terms of its original expansion, fertile forests, and the abundance of agriculture, planting sorghum and soybeans is superior to China. There are 234 mountains that produce gold, silver, copper, coal, and iron, and the mines are often placed like chess pieces. To describe it ornately, it is truly a land of plenty. But Japan despises historical facts, betrays public agreements, flaunts its military anger, is heedless of its deceitful arguments, and is acting out a play of serving Puyi overtly while covertly threatening treacherous parties to seize our land and slaughter our people. The way of trustworthiness and righteousness has reached its end. In the past, they bravely crossed the sea, revered the holy lamp, and turned toward the wind, changing their old surnames. Now, comparing the past to the present, the traces of rise and fall are tragically profound. A country that is strong can sustain itself over long distances, but a weak country cannot survive. To restore the old ways and reverse the disorder in the world, every person has a responsibility. Students, work hard. Now the national crisis is urgent, and the troubles from the enemy are deepening. The central hub of Jianghan is also the lair of the communist bandits. Coupled with years of disasters, the people and things are withering, and people have no desire to live. The morality of the people is weakening, and the spirit of the people is languishing. They do not strive to uplift themselves, follow old ways, are content with the present, and do not care about the future. Because of their shallowness, they are shameless and increasingly profit-driven, so there are those who smuggle goods for the enemy and serve in the puppet court. The arrival of foreign disasters is like summoning them. It is like a body that is weak and first fears the wind and cold, which then attack and become serious illnesses. The past path has been overturned, and the coming path is just beginning. What will you students do to make things right? Moreover, international affairs change every moment. In short, the idea of military reduction is still empty talk, and the talks of peace are mostly fantasies. A small boat floats on the sea, and if the waves are high and the steering is like a god, it may still fall. How much more so when the boat lacks the skill to navigate and the passengers harbor feelings of competing to cross the river. Speaking of disasters and defeats, one must always be mindful of being on thin ice. Students, observe the national situation externally and examine yourselves internally. The task is heavy, and the road is long. It is disheartening. All wisdom in governing the country depends on learning, and the ability to handle affairs must be based on good health. Those who are weak and have waning spirits are not enough to go far. Those whose learning is sparse and knowledge is limited are not enough to handle affairs. You should devote yourselves to physical education, pay attention to science, store up knowledge, and practice talent to serve the country. How can you remain curled up and remain safe as a broken tile for a long time? Spiritual unity is the teaching of Sun Yat-sen. Traveling together in the same carriage is the command of wise men of the past, which should be regarded as a model to follow without weariness. Being firm and working hard are all ways to cure the bad habits of indolence and weakening spirits. This is the priority for managing affairs. What I have said today are things that you students have often heard, but I am still serious about them, just to prevent forgetting and to provide a warning. Extravagant and overflowing talk, and words that are too high-sounding and impractical are useless and only serve to increase arrogance, which students should not take to heart. There are many ways to save the country. The key is that it cannot be done by shouting, jumping around, stomping one's feet, clapping one's hands, and making empty statements. As I speak, my heart is running to the three islands of Fusang (Japan). Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education (Central News Agency telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>Municipal Education Bureau Issues Circular</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued a circular to all municipal and private schools in the city, stating, "Regarding the telegram received from the Ministry of Education the other day, the telegram received from the Executive Yuan states, in brief, the central government has decided that the following three things should be added regarding the September 18th anniversary: (1) The flag should be flown at half-mast for one day on that day. (2) Although that day is a Sunday holiday, all agencies should still work as usual, all schools should still hold classes as usual, and all factories should still operate as usual. (3) All central government agencies should hold commemorative gatherings on the morning of that day. You are hereby ordered to comply, etc., as ordered. In addition to issuing separate orders, this letter is to notify you to comply," etc. In addition to issuing separate notices, corresponding letters should be issued to comply with the above.</p>
<p>Wang Qizhang's Opinion on Fasting</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Qizhang, a famous doctor in this city, sent a letter to the China Vocational Education Society yesterday, stating that the affairs of the country are in turmoil, and disasters are imminent on all sides. The Northeast has been in hiding for a year, and the blood of heroic men is boiling. They are sharpening their swords and gnashing their teeth, and cannot wait any longer. However, internal affairs are not being handled well, and the walls are not being repaired. External cooperation cannot be achieved any day, which is considered the most painful thing by those in the know. I have recently read the newspapers and deeply admire the great act of the gentlemen who advocate fasting at noon on September 18th to express their grief. They say that the saved money will be used to help the victims in the Northeast to wash away the strange shame. It is truly good and beautiful. However, I humbly suggest that the meaning of this be expanded and that a method be determined so that a certain amount can be obtained quickly without being empty words. According to the household registration of Shanghai, it is roughly assumed to be 3 million. These 3 million citizens naturally need to eat and drink every day. Now that it has been proposed to fast at noon, assume that the most frugal cost of this meal for each person is 5 cents, then 150,000 yuan can be saved from one meal. Using this to help the Northeast will not be without a small contribution. However, in fact, it may not be entirely possible, because the citizens must at least need this amount for each meal, and this meal may not be able to be saved (physiologically speaking, occasionally saving one meal and replacing it with two or three bowls of light salt water will not harm the body, but this is difficult to say for the laboring class). Therefore, it is impossible to force everyone to contribute these 5 cents. However, I also think that the need of a single dish saved by a family with fine clothes and good food can exceed this by several times. Therefore, by shortening the long and replenishing the short, it is possible to take the 3 million citizens of Shanghai as a unit and each do their best to make up the 150,000 yuan, which should not be difficult. For example, my family has a total of five people, and the average share for each citizen is only 25 cents. However, I think that although I am not rich, I still have the ability to pay for 199 citizens who cannot afford it, which is 9 yuan and 95 cents. This shows that among the 3 million citizens, there are 1,000 people who are like me, better than me by several times, hundreds of times, ten thousand times, or even a million times better than me. There are countless more citizens, and I don't know how many citizens they can afford to pay for. I deeply hope that you gentlemen will take this idea a step further and notify all organizations, agencies, schools, families, and the public in this city to do their best to contribute to the number of people they can afford to pay for. Then small streams will become a river, which can be expected to be established immediately. There is even more heart to advise the whole country to steal and hope for great success, etc.</p>
<p>Shanghai University Holds National Crisis Meeting Shanghai Hujiang University teachers and students have been deeply indignant about the national crisis since September 18th. This year, they encountered the Shanghai Incident, and they are even more excited to engage in anti-Japanese and national salvation work after class, vowing to actively seek knowledge and strengthen their strength with the spirit of lying on firewood and tasting gall, and to carry out a sustained and long-term struggle. It is scheduled to hold a "September 18th" National Crisis Commemoration Meeting in the auditorium at 9:00 AM this Sunday, chaired by Dean Fan. Professor Jin will give a lecture, and all new and old students are required to attend. At the same time, it will continue to promote Japanese studies, text propaganda, and national goods introduction. It is said that the National Crisis Commemoration Meeting of the affiliated middle school will be chaired by Director Li and various teachers will be invited to speak.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Alumni of Zhongguo Public School Organize a Reopening Committee <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Zhongguo Public School is an academic institution with a rich history. It has been established for 30 years. The school site is more than a thousand acres and is located near the Wusong coast. It is large in scale and has achieved great results. Unfortunately, it was completely destroyed by the violent Japanese artillery fire in the January 28th Incident. Therefore, the school board of directors recommended Mr. Xiong Kewu as the president of the school to maintain it. Mr. Xiong is also a member of the Central Committee and cannot take care of both, so he strongly declined the position, which resulted in the failure to open classes this semester and a de facto suspension. The alumni of the school could not bear the interruption of studies and the loss of education for the students at the school, so they held a meeting to discuss the reopening issue at Liangyuan a few days ago. Hundreds of people attended the meeting, and a reopening committee was immediately organized. Zeng Bangxi, Chen Chaolun, Lu Congtang, Zhou Jisheng, and Yao Zhaoli were elected to be responsible for the work. It is said that the work has now begun, and the office is temporarily located at the law office of Yao Zhaoli, Zhonghe Bank, Shanxi Road, Nanjing Road. It is also planned to ask the founder of the school, Wang Jingfang, the school board members Cai Yuanpei, Yu Youren, and Wang Yunwu, and the alumni Hu Shi, Yang Xingfo, Zhu Jingnong, and Liu Binglin to find ways to assist in order to achieve the goal of reopening the school.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Game</p>
<p>Queier reported on the plan for this year's Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Game and decided that Hong Kong will come to Shanghai, and Shanghai will go to Hong Kong.

<p>Song Junfu and Liu Changchun Returned North Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The China National Sports Association held a banquet at the International Sports Association on Jing'an Temple Road at 7 PM last night, inviting people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about sports to welcome Mr. Shen Siliang (who is a backbone member of the Sports Association), the representative who attended the World Games this time. Those who were invited included people from political, business, and academic circles who have been directors, executives, and staff members of the association for many years, including Wang Zhengting, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Zheng Hongsheng, Cheng Yize, Guo Bingwen, Cao Yunxiang, Huang Mingdao, Qu Wenliu, Shi Jingcai, Zhang Zhuping, Wang Boqi, Xu Zhendong, Le Xiurong, Zhou Jiaqi, Shi Zhaokang, and Zhao Tianpeng. In addition, there were also several foreign guests, including Tuo Ping, who were invited to attend. Song Junfu and Liu Changchun returned north from Shanghai early yesterday morning. The main purpose of this banquet was to express a welcome to Representative Shen and to report to all sectors on the process and feelings of attending the World Games this time, which proves that the association's investment in attending the World Games this time has had significant gains and meaning. The mission of the delegation has come to an end. From now on, the improvement and development of our country's sports can be expected and awaited. The sports reporters' banquet was cancelled. In addition, when Mr. Shen went abroad, the Shanghai sports reporters held a farewell banquet. When Song Junfu and Liu Changchun set off, they were also bid farewell to boost their morale. This time, when the representatives returned to China, the sports reporters originally planned to give them a welcome dinner again, but since Song and Liu had already returned north, it was cancelled immediately. There are endless apologies to Mr. Shen, Song, and Liu.</p>

<p>Interest Focused on 100m Freestyle</p>
<p>The Chinese swimming team and the Macleans team held a friendly competition at 3 PM yesterday at the Jiaotong University swimming pool in Xujiahui. There were a total of six events. In addition to the relay, each team had two participants in each event, with the top three finishers scoring five, three, and one point, respectively. The relay race was scored 4-0. As a result of the competition, Macleans showed great strength, winning five first places. China only won one championship, with Zhong Langxuan winning the breaststroke.

China's Yin Yanjun and Zhu Jiongde competed for the lead, making the situation very intense. After the turn, Ronald's speed increased, surging ahead to secure the victory. Cole and Yin Yanjun were unable to catch up, with Cole taking second and Yin finishing third. Zhu Jiongde did not place. The time was 30.6 seconds.

<p>(Shen Siliang)</p>
<p>The Olympic Village: The organizing committee specially built the Olympic Village as a residence for athletes from various countries. The village consists of a total of five hundred houses, each with a central room, separated by a shower room and a balcony. The room is equipped with two exquisitely crafted beds, as well as straw mats and cane chairs. It is said that three thousand straw mats and five thousand cane chairs were custom-made in Hong Kong. The village has a theater where various dramas are performed every night for the entertainment of the athletes. Famous male and female movie stars from Hollywood have also performed there. There are post offices, wireless, and telegraph facilities. Each house is equipped with a telephone. The village is located on a hilltop, overlooking the entire city, offering a panoramic view. The grass is green, and the flowers are fresh, showcasing the beautiful scenery of nature. The village offers a variety of food, but some teams also bring their own cooks. It is said that the Japanese team brought their own ingredients. Languages from all over the world can be heard. The residents are very happy, as if they were in a paradise. Athletes can travel in and out of the village on dedicated buses, free of charge. After the closing of the games, the village will also disappear, as all the buildings in the village have been sold and will be used as seaside houses. Therefore, the organizing committee did not spend a penny to provide such a beautiful village for the athletes to live in, which is admirable.</p>
<p>The Assistance of Newspapers: The success of the games owes a great deal to the assistance of American newspapers. However, the organizing committee treats each newspaper equally and imposes strict restrictions. There is no possibility of increasing the number of seats for reporters. The reporters' seats are located in the highest row of the honorary seats, each equipped with a typewriter and a telegraph machine connected to the telegraph office. If reporters do not use a typewriter, they can directly use the telegraph or wireless radio to notify their newspaper. The competition among reporters from various newspapers is very intense. The telegraph office uses the latest equipment to transmit news quickly. Within five minutes after each competition, the newspapers have already received the news. In addition, wireless radio is used to broadcast news to countries around the world at any time. The relationship between the organizing committee and the newspapers is mutually beneficial and excellent, which China can learn from.</p>

Zhong was far in the lead, followed by Duer, with Ling Chongju in last place. Zhong Langxuan had excellent form and a calm demeanor, progressing slowly without showing any signs of fatigue. In the last 25 meters, although Duer vigorously swam with all his might, he ultimately finished second. Zhong secured the only first place. The time was 3 minutes 39 seconds. In this race, China scored six points, and Macleans scored three points.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Sayings of 93-Year-Old Ma Xiangbo: Words of Mourning for the September 18th Incident <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast has been lost for a year, from September 18th last year to September 18th this year! The aggressors celebrate, while the invaded can only mourn. Old Man Xiang, at 93, has repeatedly expressed deep sorrow for this national humiliation!</p>
<p>I remember that on the eve of the national day of mourning for this incident last year, Old Man Xiang instructed me to write a message to the nation. After the draft was completed, because it was late at night, Old Man Xiang told me to send it to the Shenbao newspaper immediately. I took care of it in the dim night; but I caught a cold and got a cold; I thought that getting sick for the sake of the country was very proud. The next morning, I still took the text in the special column of Shenbao and sent it to Old Man Xiang to read in person. Some points were considered very correct, and some were considered inadequate. Later, he wrote a few paragraphs himself. I am now copying it out for use this year.</p>
<p>·······················</p>
<p>"The country is an organism. A country without national defense, and defense without secrets, is a country without land. If the four classes of people lack scientific knowledge (knowledge), and production, and the military and food are all taken from foreign goods, then there are no people. If politics does not follow administrative law (original note: Administration), then there is no government. Without government, there is no organism, and it is meat on the table, not a country."</p>
<p>"It is said: Cultivate yourself and do not blame others, then you will be spared from difficulties. It is also said: 'Defend the country and forget the dead.' Duke Wen of Wei wore clothes of coarse cloth and caps of coarse silk, devoted himself to materials and trained farmers, opened up trade and benefited craftsmen, respected education and encouraged learning, and assigned positions to the capable. In the first year, he had thirty chariots, and in the last year, he had three hundred chariots. If the people of the country can follow the morality and politics of Duke Wen of Wei, and save the money spent on opium and paper cigarettes in one year to build chariots, then it would not be difficult to have even three thousand, let alone three hundred! Or open a military factory to strengthen national defense. Why spend tens of millions of dollars every year to buy foreign weapons to kill compatriots, never being satisfied?"</p>
<p>"Alas! The whole country says that there is no conscience or religion! Since Xu Guangqi introduced Western water conservancy in Shanghai, and Wang Zheng wrote 'Wonderful Devices Explained' in Guanzhong more than three hundred years ago, the government has been unable to use domestic goods to build national defense, and the people have been unable to use science to create what they need for daily life. In the past fifty or sixty years, our eastern neighbor has been able to do everything that the western neighbor can do. It is appropriate for them to forget humanity and only think of Yi shooting for the sake of improving themselves! Being of the same culture and race is merely a saying for smiling tigers. How can it be believed?"</p>
<p>······························</p>
<p>Note: Last year, I included Old Man Xiang's mourning text in the "Collection of Mr. Ma Xiangbo's National Crisis Speeches" printed and distributed by the Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association. You can write to the association to request a copy.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Silent Mourning <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Qian</p>
<p>How Shall We Mourn?</p>
<p>September 18th has arrived. The bloody commemoration has reached its first anniversary! The National Government has ordered all party members and civil servants across the country to observe five minutes of silence at 11:00 AM to express their mourning. What are we mourning?</p>
<p>Dear readers, let us not sigh during these five minutes! Sighing shows weakness and incompetence! Let us not shed tears during these five minutes, tears show surrender! No! We want neither! We must strengthen our resolve during these five minutes!</p>
<p>What is the use of only blaming the government? Why do we not actively guide the government and cooperate with the government? Can selfish people like us produce an ideal government? Do not blame others, start with yourself! Students, workers, businessmen, think about how you can serve the country! How can you be worthy of the country? Let's all work hard! Starting from these five minutes, everyone should establish a way to serve the country, strive to do it, and not be too concerned about personal gains and losses. We must take the country as the premise. If the country is destroyed, we cannot be selfish. Government officials, I think you also have the same grief during these five minutes! But what is the use of mere grief? Let's not talk about the past. May you all not forget these five minutes. From now on, everyone should abandon personal interests and put the interests of the people and the country first, without failing the Party, without failing the country, and with one heart and one mind. Even if you cannot immediately eliminate the national crisis, you can at least be worthy of the Premier in heaven and the 400 million people below.</p>

<p>— Xi Niao</p>
<p>Deeply Engraved in My Heart, Never to Be Erased</p>
<p>"September 18th" jumps again in front of the Chinese people who are anesthetized by drugs. Early on, the calls for resolute resistance against aggression and determination to avenge...will be droning on people's ears again.</p>
<p>The newspapers are full of voices boycotting enemy goods, which truly chills the enemy's heart. In reality, which store can truly implement this in the midst of the storm of relying entirely on large-scale price reductions to survive?</p>
<p>The high-sounding call to promote domestic goods has now disappeared. Perhaps the period of promoting domestic goods has already become a thing of the past. Everyone! How many domestic goods have you bought?</p>
<p>Recently, I saw the words "Conscience Saves the Nation, Do Not Buy Enemy Goods" and "Those Who Give This Bill to the Enemy Are Thieves and Whores" written on banknotes. I don't hope for anything, I only hope that those who write those words are not just passionate friends who are just talking and writing.</p>
<p>I once heard a triumphant friend of the "Husband Serving Servant" theory say: "You men only know how to talk empty words, and there is actually no benefit at all. This is absolutely the opposite of the position that we women take in our actions, which is why we are successful." Ha! Men! Remember this! About all of this.</p>
<p>In elementary school, foreign goods are rarely seen in students' attire. In middle school, students' attire is a blend of Chinese and Western styles. In college, students' attire, perhaps due to reading too many foreign books, is like receiving a foreign education, with no trace of domestic goods to be found. Who says that the ability to save the country is transferred along with the level of knowledge?</p>
<h3 id="e98">September 18th and Bastard <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>China's National Humiliation Day is just like Wang Xiaoer's New Year, getting better and better every year. Look, the September 18th that no one ever paid attention to in the past has suddenly become a "September 18th" National Humiliation Day that is as fresh as can be this year.</p>
<p>The "September 18th" National Humiliation Day is today last year, when the Japanese, using the pretext that the South Manchuria Railway was damaged, sent troops to occupy the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Using underhanded means, they manipulated Pu Yi to create a puppet state, preparing to annex it in the future.</p>
<p>All previous National Humiliation Days were nothing more than opening concessions, recognizing indemnities, and signing humiliating treaties. This National Humiliation Day, however, gave an entire piece of land to others to use as a base, and a large number of people to be slaves. This shame is truly the ultimate shame.</p>
<p>I hope everyone will endure hardship and vow to avenge the national humiliation. Do not forget "September 18th" in a muddle-headed way. Forgetting "September 18th" is just being a "bastard."</p>
<h3 id="e99">Vanguards of National Destruction <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>May everyone pay attention!</p>
<p>The "September 18th" Incident is truly a national humiliation of unprecedented depth for our nation! Regarding this tragic national disaster that has awakened our minds and pierced our hearts, how should we endure hardship and encourage ourselves, be alert and awakened, and strive to be strong, so that we can unite as one, avenge our humiliation and save the country, and wash away the nickname of a sleeping lion!</p>
<p>Today is the painful commemoration of "September 18th." This shocking tragedy, no matter what, can never be forgotten! But alas, what kind of phenomena do we see around us today?</p>
<p>In theaters and playgrounds, there are still operas with urgent pipes and colorful costumes.</p>
<p>In restaurants, hotels, and brothels, it is still the same extravagance and debauchery with prostitutes.</p>
<p>In dance halls, it is still the same melodious music and revelry of lights and wine.</p>
<p>In cafes and massage parlors, it is still the same play and amusement.</p>
<p>In dog racing tracks and jai alai courts, it is still gambling with thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>In general clubs, associations, mansions, and shops, there is still mahjong playing.</p>
<p>In the park, there are still pairs of lovers holding hands, taking photos, talking about love, and coming and going.</p>
<p>How many of these people do not know the hatred of national destruction? If foreign enemies come, they will be the vanguards of national destruction. Let's all pay attention.</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>Fen Ruo suddenly walked to the window and stood there, thinking and considering, while tears fell silently on her lapel. She turned her back to Commander Yuan, her shoulders heaving.</p>
<p>"I should ask for your forgiveness. You have suffered all these hardships for the past ten years because of me. Now my pure and sincere soul is driving my body, teaching me to find you and ask you to discard all the sorrow in your heart. Let us hold hands and walk to the door of happiness again. Don't cry! You should remember the last time we separated. I hugged you like a provocation and said to you in a threatening manner: You said that one day I will come and disturb your heart, and hug you tightly so that you can't breathe after you get married. You replied to me: You are still so unprogressive, singing childish songs with a few children, and you won't sing marching songs. I have the strength to no longer give you any comfort or satisfaction. Fen Ruo! I have never forgotten this sentence that encouraged me. At any moment, or in any cubic inch of space, if you betray your previous words, I will tear up all my memories, tearing the curtain of my bright and happy hopes." Commander Yuan put his hands on her shoulders and turned his face towards Fen Ruo.</p>
<p>But Fen Ruo was still crying and shrugging her shoulders, especially heavily. Commander Yuan seemed to be at a loss for words, unable to think of any more real and touching words. So the room was silent for three minutes. Commander Yuan walked around the room, grabbing his head incessantly, feeling distressed and unable to solve the problem.</p>
<p>At this time, Fen Ruo suddenly turned around and went to Commander Yuan, saying, "Commander Yuan, please forgive me. I have considered it again and again. My previous behavior was so bad. I couldn't see through your true feelings for me. I have regretted it very much. Now I can no longer insult you with an unfortunate soul. This is my sincere intention. Please understand my circumstances. But I am unspeakably grateful for your sincere love. Please take care of your body, cherish your identity and reputation, and develop your future career! I now make a vow to sacrifice myself to find your abandoned wife. Although I have never seen what her face looks like or how tall she is, I imagine that her love for you has not waned. Suppose she is still alive and has not died. Please love her as much as you love me. You only need to think about the pain of your own heartbreak to imagine how your wife feels, and you will surely feel sorry for her and love her again. In these past ten years, I have become accustomed to a monotonous life. At most, I will spend another ten years or so, and then I will end my life's history. But your career is just beginning. Our country will never allow a hero to be mired in the trap of women's love again. If you really love me, you should understand these words of mine! My husband, although a soldier, his thinking and physique are really not worthy of being a soldier, although he has been dead for more than ten years, but I still have the right to criticize him, because he refused to listen to me and abandoned his indulgent life. Commander Yuan! I will always be a friend with you, and I will never throw away your figure and mind outside my brain, at any time."</p>

<p>Domestic British Stable, American Tight</p>
<p>Forward Transactions Gradually Closing In</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Silver Market in England Fell and in the United States Remained Stable. The Market Situation Tended to be Soft, and the Exchange Rate Did Not Change. However, the Market Situation in This Port Tended to Be Good. HSBC's Listed Price Narrowed by Half a Notch After Three Revisions Compared to Yesterday's Post-Market, With Both England and the United States Reduced by 125. Except for the Hong Kong Exchange Rate Which Did Not Change, All Others Were Also Revised Higher. The Bank's Domestic Market Was Slightly Loose in the Morning, but Then Tightened, Because the Gold Price Also Became Strong. Compared to the Previous Evening at Noon Closing, the British Gold Was Flat, and the American Dollar Was Reduced by 0.0625. However, It Was Slightly Different From the Situation of the Gold Auction. Chinese Merchants Were Still Trading Tirelessly, but British Gold Was Rather Indifferent. Only About 500,000 to 600,000 Yuan in US Dollars Were Traded. Various Gold Firms First Blocked and Then Dug In, and Various Banks Such as McCalle Had Inward Transfers. The Post-Market Was Affected by the Weekend.</p>

<p>Silver Dismantling Still Loose</p>
<p>Since the Fall of the Ocean Cent, the Financial Market Has Been Depressed for a Long Time. People's Hearts Are Almost Exhausted, and After Several Months, There Is No Hope of Recovery. After the Mid-Autumn Festival This Time, This Street's Business Is Depressed, and the Settlement of Accounts Is Not as Prosperous as When It Was Living Here. However, the Digestion of Customer Needs Has Slightly Activated. The Firms Have Taken the Opportunity to Buy in Order to Raise the Market Price. The Looseness of the Silver Root Is Entirely Due to the Market's凋零and the懈怠of Needs. I Am Afraid That It Will Be Difficult to Hope for Relief in a Short Time.</p>

As a Result, It Was a Total of 2 Li Better Than the Previous Day's Noon Market. The Transaction Volume Was 135,000 Jiao in the Early Market and 35,000 Jiao in the Noon Market. Copper Coins Were Reduced by 1,500 Wen, Reaching 432,000 Wen. The Transaction Volume Was 50,544 Strings of Wen, Equivalent to 11,700 Taels of Silver.</p>
<p>Silver Ocean In and Out Not Weak (Silver 款) Although the News of Bank Receipts and Settlements Yesterday Was Not as Frequent as the Previous Day, It Was Still Quite Gratifying.

<p>Price Slightly Rises, Turnover Only Over One Million</p>
<p>Yesterday (17th), the Situation of Various Bond Markets in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the Spot Market Only Traded a Total of 9,000 Yuan for 20 Customs, Unified Tax, 96, etc. All Day Long, and There Was No Trading in Other Bonds. The Futures Market Was Even More Deserted, With Very Few Entries and Exits in the Market. It Is Estimated That Each Board in the Front and Back Markets Was Only Over 500,000, Totaling 1,065,000 Yuan. The Central Unified Salt Tax Was Estimated to Be Over 890,000 Yuan, and Other Bonds Were Only Around 100,000 Yuan. There Was No Market for the Entire Sixth Finance. As for the Trend of the Price of Various Bonds, It Is Still Characterized by Very Few Entries and Exits, Extremely Flat Supply and Demand, and Prices Are in a Swirling State With Very Small Fluctuations. There Was Only a Change of One or Two 角In the Front and Back Markets. As a Result, There Was a Slight Scattered Need in the Market, and It Rose by About Two 角Compared to the Previous Day. Looking at the Situation of the Bond Market, It Is Extremely Chaotic, and It Is Still Difficult to Hope for a Turnaround in a Short Time.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report, Friday (15th) New York Stock Market, At First, It Was Still Stabilizing. In the Afternoon, Because It Was Generally Expected That the American Steel Company Would Suffer a Huge Loss and the Next Preferred Stock Dividend Would Be Cancelled, There Were More Sales, and the Price Fell. At the Closing, Another Wave Occurred, and the Price Rebounded. As a Result, It Was Mixed Compared to the Previous Day, With No Significant Change. The Total Number of Transactions on the 16th Was 1.9 Million Shares. Predicting the Trend of the Stock Market, It Seems That Short Sellers Are Gradually Exhausting, and Bulls Are Waiting for the Commercial Report and Are Unwilling to Buy in Large Quantities. Therefore, the Changes in the Stock Market in the Next Few Days Should Be More Subtle. The Dow Jones Index Is Listed on the Left.</p>

However, This Buying Is Not Violent. In the Absence of New Excitement, The Cotton Market in the Nearest Future Seems to Depend on the Size of the Hedging Amount and the Absence of Absorption. According to the Domestic Trade Statistics in August, The Number of Cotton Cloth Orders Not Fulfilled Is Very Large, The Largest Since March 1929, and The Inventory Is Reduced by 255%. This Week's Weather Is Suitable for Picking Cotton, But According to Private Reports, The Fruit Has Increased Greatly, and the Cotton Production in Each Region, Except for the Northern Two-Thirds of the Cotton Belt, Continues to Decrease.

However, The Digestion on This Street Was Still Active. Yesterday, More Than 2,000 Packages of Small Strangling Were Handled, 500 Packages of Saigon, and 200 Packages of Jiangxi Ji Yuan. The Market Saw a Turnaround Again. Small Strangling Rice Was Once Called Higher by Five Fen in the Morning, and Turned Flat in the Afternoon. However, Saigon Rice Had Risen by One Jiao and a Half, Because The Saigon in The Market Stock Was Gradually Decreasing, and The Goods Owners All Had The Intention of Rebounding. Even the Small Strangling Goods Owners With More Stock Were Not Willing to Easily Sell. With Little Saigon Stock, There Was Even The Intention of Not Selling Unless at a High Price, So The Market Can Be Temporarily Stabilized. Saigon Opened for Sale at 9 Yuan 6 Jiao to 9 Yuan 5 Jiao and a Half, Small Strangling at 8 Yuan 5 Jiao and a Half to 8 Yuan 8 Jiao, and Jiangxi Yuan Rice at 13 Yuan 4 Jiao to 13 Yuan 2 Jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Continues to Determine in The Sound</p>
<p>Flour Market Falls Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's Flour Market, After The Opening in The Morning, The Market in Each Month Presented The Phenomenon of Initial Stability and Continued Decline. The Quoted Price of Foreign Wheat, Chicago Imposed Four or Five Points, and Canada Was Still Slightly Two or Three 角Different. In Addition, The Gold Price Rising Trend Has Been Very Strong for Days, and People's Hearts Have Stabilized. However, Because Manufacturers Have Indeed Continued to Determine Foreign Wheat, They Still Have Chips in Hand. Therefore, The Near and Far Periods Have Declined Again and Again. However, The Number of Factory Throws Has Not Been Very Strong, so the Degree of Falling Is Not Much. Until The Opening in The Afternoon, It Was Reported That 3.7 Qian's Third Wheat Had Been Opened Again. The Opening Price for This Month Was First Unstable, and The Opening Price Was 1 Liang 8 Qian 7 Fen. However, Because The Factory Throwing Stopped Later, Each Month Floated, and Advanced Step by Step Again. The Market Was Tired and Rebounded, But The Manufacturers Continued to Determine Foreign Wheat. After This, The Chips Will Inevitably Increase Step by Step, Which Is Unfavorable to The Bulls. As a Result, This Month Fell by One Fen and a Half Compared to The Previous Day, October Fell by One Fen and Two Li and a Half, November Fell by One Fen, December Fell by One Fen and Two or Two and a Half, and January Fell by Seven Li and a Half.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Futures Wheat Market, After The Opening in The Morning, The Market in Each Month Still Presented a Stable Trend. Because The Quoted Price of Foreign Wheat in Chicago Was Slightly Four or Five Points Strong, and Canada Was Slightly Two or Three 角, The Trading Inside and Outside The Industry Was Stable, One or Two Points Better Than The Previous Day. Until The Opening in The Afternoon, This Month's Market Has Been Unstable, Because There Are Spot Market Practitioners, And Continued To Cover Out, And The Manufacturers, Because Foreign Wheat Can Be Set, Had an Attitude of Indifference Towards This Wheat. The Far-End Also Saw Emptiness in People's Hearts Due to The Gradual Setting of Foreign Wheat. Although The Degree of Falling Was Not Much, People's Hearts Were Not as Strong as Before. As a Result, September Was Slightly One Point Less Than The Previous Day, October and November Were One Point Less, December Was Unchanged, January Was Slightly One Point Less, and February Was Unchanged. The Spot Wheat Market Was Still Stable, Opening Yangzhou Wheat at 3 Liang 4 Qian 7 Fen, and Changzhou Wheat at 3 Liang 4 Qian 6 Fen, For a Total of 600 Packages.</p>

<p>Yesterday Only French Bank Supplemented, Futures Price Trend Flat and Tired</p>
<p>Yesterday The Silk Sales of Japanese Local Foreign Banks Still Didn't Improve. The New York Market's Silk Stocks Were Abundant, and Japanese Silk Merchants Were Still Competing to Sell Vigorously, and Prices Became More Tired. The Futures and Spot Silk Telegrams Sent by Qianli and Others at The Beginning of The Week Didn't Transfer Yesterday. Only The French Bank Supplemented Shortages, Calculating 30 Packages of Shanghai White Factory Made Middle Body B Grade 13 to 15 条 Shares Entered by Xinfu, Lianna, Dachang, etc., Shanghai White Factory Through November Futures Price From 635 Taels to 585 Taels.

<h3 id="e116">Stagnant Sales of Zhenmei Tea <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The tea market in this port has been quite calm recently. Though there is still some sales of supporting teas like Zhenmei and Xiumei to France, the existing inventory is already running low. Most of the green tea available on the market consists of Zhenmei and Gongxi varieties. In particular, the Zhenmei teas from northwestern and northern parts of Wuyuan, despite being new, have only sold about one-tenth of their stock since their arrival in Shanghai. While there have been inquiries from Africa about the samples sent in recent weeks, the prices offered are considered too low. There has also been no progress with the teas from Tunxi, Shexian, and eastern Wuyuan regarding the Moroccan market. From the current situation, it seems that the prices of all types of red and green teas are likely to decline uniformly.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated White Sugar Rises Again by Five Cents <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw good momentum due to the stability of the Dutch exchange rate. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's set prices also increased, with No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar priced at 14 taels, 5 mace, 7 fen, and 5 li, up five cents from the previous day. However, sales were limited, and the market expects further price increases. As today is Sunday, transactions are expected to be slow. The original Hong Kong ice flower green sugar was still priced at 12 taels and 2 mace yesterday, but merchants showed little interest, suggesting a possible easing of prices. Jianbing sugar, lacking supply, was not willing to compromise on prices, and sales were slow, resulting in no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e118">North-South Goods: Chicken Heart Red Dates Saw New Arrivals Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of new chicken heart red dates, handled by Shen Hang's agent in Hankou, arrived yesterday. Due to the limited quantity, prices remained firm, selling for 11 taels. The inventory of Tianjin red dates has been dwindling recently, and prices have been stable. Yesterday, first-grade household red dates sold for 12 taels and 5 mace, second-grade household red dates for 10 taels and 5 mace, and third-grade household red dates for 9 taels. There were transactions both within this street and with the inland regions. It will be difficult for prices to ease before the arrival of new goods.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Hardware: Sales Show Activity <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The continuous rain yesterday limited the number of industry peers in the market, and purchasing by out-of-town merchants was limited, resulting in scattered transactions. However, the Fujian merchants seem to be showing progress recently, purchasing more goods than other merchants. The key market conditions are summarized below:</p>
<p>Domestically Produced Small Wire Nails Sell Well Throughout the City: Domestically produced round nails (i.e., nails from local factories) have been widely sold both locally and in other cities, significantly impacting the sales of imported products. The newly released small wire nails, due to their low prices, have been selling quickly. Many local and out-of-town customers are happy to purchase them, resulting in considerable sales. However, recently, there has been a shortage of supply from factories, while demand is high, leading to occasional supply shortages. The prices remain strong, with 3-fen nails at 11 taels and 5 mace and 5 li, 4- and 5-fen nails at 11 taels and 3 mace and 5 li, and 6-fen nails at 10 taels and 9 mace. It is reported that the Fujian merchants have purchased 200-300 barrels in recent days, while the Yangtze River merchants have purchased 70-80 barrels.</p>
<p>10,000 Sheets of Domestically Produced Flat White Iron Sheet Were Ordered: 10,000 sheets of domestically produced flat white iron sheet, managed by the manager of China Steel Products Company, were ordered yesterday. It is reported that these were ordered by local merchants. Few out-of-town merchants have received this news, resulting in little transaction. First-grade products are priced at 8 mace and 8 fen per sheet, second-grade products at 8 mace and 5 fen, while thick patterned sheets had no transaction yesterday.</p>
<p>300-400 Tons of Bamboo Steel Bars Were Ordered: Yesterday, Fujian, Qingdao, and Yangtze River merchants purchased over 200 tons of bamboo steel bars, while local construction merchants purchased over 100 tons. In addition, smaller retailers purchased 70-80 tons. The price per ton is 65 taels, slightly up from the previous prices. It is said that the profit margins are thin, but market confidence is good, and the market anticipates further price increases.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Coal: Shanxi Coal Market Prices Gradually Loosen <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Since the summer, the price of Shanxi white coal has been gradually declining, from 19 taels, 2 mace, and 5 fen per ton to 15 taels. However, despite the price drop, transactions have not improved, and the influx of goods from the mines has led to an oversupply in various warehouses, causing unstable prices. Yesterday, the market openly quoted a price difficult to call 15 taels, but slightly lowering it by 1 or 2 mace would make it possible to buy.</p>

<h3 id="e121">From China's Current Education to Hosting Public Libraries (Continued) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>The need for hosting public libraries has been discussed previously. Now, I will talk about the specific methods. In my opinion, we should not rely on the government for this kind of social undertaking, because facts have told us that anything that falls into the hands of our esteemed government will be messed up terribly. Therefore, for this kind of easy task, it is better for us, the people, to do it ourselves. Start with one or two interested and enthusiastic people to raise some funds (a hundred yuan is enough to start a library). To avoid spending on rent, it is best to set up the library in a private home and take turns managing it in the spare time of the morning and evening. Ordinary people who are under economic pressure and cannot afford to go to school but are busy with life can also take this opportunity to borrow books and read. Rules must be strict. The borrowing fee is one yuan, which is refunded at the end of the year, and paid again the following year. For each subsequent borrowing, a copper coin or two is charged. The interest from the deposit and the regular income from copper coins are used exclusively for purchasing books. With a clear conscience, public accounts should be kept to build trust in society.</p>
<p>Regarding the quality of books to be prepared, I feel that the city and countryside should not be the same. The reasons are: (1) the lifestyles of the city and countryside are different, (2) therefore, the needs and interests of the people in terms of books are also different. However, one should not be too extreme. One should strive to converge and integrate the lives of the city and countryside while adapting to each other's environment. In terms of level, the city should be slightly higher, with at least the level of a first-year junior high school student. The countryside should be slightly lower. The fundamental condition is that the writing should be in simple language, and the reasoning should be clear and concise so that readers can easily understand. Therefore, those who identify and prepare books should not only have deep knowledge but also carefully consider the needs of their community. One should not be perfunctory. Now, I will list the categories of books below.</p>
<p>For the public library in the city:</p>
<p>(1) Medical and health books: there are many urban residents, the air is polluted, and the society is complex, so this type of book is very important.</p>
<p>(2) Industrial and commercial series: to meet the needs of general store employees and workers.</p>
<p>(3) National ideology series: to import national ideology and resist the oppression of imperialism.</p>
<p>(4) Books that expose the dark secrets of the authorities: so that everyone can understand the pros and cons and not blindly follow, such as only focusing on civil war and not resisting imperialist aggression.</p>
<p>(5) Literary books: to cultivate morality and relieve</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>spirit.</p>
<p>For the public library in the countryside:</p>
<p>(1) Books that break superstitions: Superstition is prevalent in the countryside, hindering social evolution, so more of these books should be prepared.</p>
<p>(2) Agricultural series: Various methods in Chinese agriculture are from thousands of years ago, and new knowledge should be imparted.</p>
<p>(34) (Same as the city's)</p>
<p>(5) Introductory industrial books: to improve general handicrafts.</p>
<p>(6) Farmer's literature books: Must be simple and stimulating, so that villagers can also receive some intellectual comfort.</p>
<p>With this method, as long as three or four people take the lead and achieve good results, it will not be difficult to spread to all parts of the country. I plan to host one when I return to my hometown at the end of the year. This is just my humble opinion, and I dare not say it is appropriate. I hope that all enthusiastic members will discuss it together.</p>

<p>Making peace with the barbarians is ultimately shameful. The sinking [court] still shamelessly served the enemy as his father. The barbarians only knew the emperor was important. The treacherous officials did not plan for the country. Iron cavalry roamed three thousand miles. Sixteen prefectures of Lulong were lost. Appeasing the enemy was not just about one Shi Jin. The beacon fires in the northeast have been a source of sorrow for a long time.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Several Kinds of Chemical Gold Plating <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Tianlan</p>
<p>A. Gold Plating on Iron Wire</p>
<p>Gold or silver plating on iron wire is very beautiful and easy to do. Simply soak the iron wire in dilute sulfuric acid, then place it in concentrated nitric acid to etch away the rust on the iron wire. However, a little smoke should be added to the nitric acid. After the iron rust is etched away, wash it with lime water, then rinse with clean water. Tie a piece of lead sheet to one end, then immerse it in copper water to plate a layer of copper. Then wash it with clean water. If you want to gold plate it, put it in gold water. If you want to silver plate it, put it in silver water. After plating, place it in hot sawdust to dry it quickly.</p>
<p>(1) Copper Water Recipe: 36 parts sodium hydroxide, 30 parts potassium tartrate, 7 parts copper sulfate, 200 parts rainwater.</p>
<p>(2) Gold Water Recipe: 10 parts gold chloride, 150 parts potassium cyanide, combine in 500 parts rainwater. Separately, 30 parts potassium hydroxide, 55 parts sodium hydroxide and phosphorus pentoxide, combine in 500 parts rainwater. Mix them together to form.</p>
<p>(3) Silver Water Recipe: 500 parts silver nitrate and dilute nitric acid, 350 parts potassium cyanide, 1000 parts rainwater.</p>
<p>B. Gold Plating on Copper Utensils</p>
<p>Whether it's yellow copper or red copper, gold plating is very simple. Dissolve 3 mace of real gold in aqua regia to make a kind of gold chloride, add 2 liters of distilled water, 1 pound of potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate, and boil for 2 hours. Then wash the copper utensils and ornaments clean and immerse them in the liquid for a minute at most to create a golden and brilliant item.</p>
<p>C. Gold Plating on Glass</p>
<p>Gold-plated glass is indeed a valuable modern decoration. The method is very simple, just use three liquids: 20 parts of liquid A, 50 parts of liquid B, and 5 parts of liquid C, and mix them together. First wash the glass with alkali water, apply the liquid, and after a while the gold color will adhere to it. It will not peel off over time.</p>
<p>(1) Liquid A Recipe: 20 parts gold chloride, 150 parts distilled water.</p>
<p>(2) Liquid B Recipe: 50 parts anhydrous sodium hydroxide and light magnesium hydroxide, 20 parts distilled water.</p>
<p>(3) Liquid C Recipe: 20 parts alcohol, 20 parts pure acetaldehyde, 2.5 parts glucose, 30 parts distilled water.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Discussion on Improving the Rental System <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Fengzhao</p>
<p>In this city, most rentals are sub-rented from second landlords. To make a profit, second landlords modify the houses arbitrarily, harming public health and demanding rents at will, with no uniformity in prices. Measures should be taken to improve this to maintain the livelihood of ordinary people. "Reason" In Shanghai, apart from the general bourgeoisie who own their own houses or rent entire Western-style houses, the rest of the ordinary people mostly live together in a lane house with four or five families, with one family acting as the second landlord in charge.</p>
<p>The second landlord rents the entire house, and apart from their own needs, sub-rents the rest to other families. This was originally a cooperative nature, a good idea,</p>
<p>But the current second landlords (this refers to the general ones, not all second landlords in Shanghai) are becoming more and more sophisticated. They modify the houses arbitrarily, regardless of hygiene, as long as there are more rooms, they can rent out more rent. Therefore, these second landlords not only live in the houses for free, but also make money. They rely on being second landlords to maintain their lives, and they have a way to make money, which is admirable. However, because second landlords want to make money, they become third tenants, desperately increasing rents. For the same room, some second landlords only charge ten dollars, while others charge fifteen dollars. The third tenants, because they do not have the ability to be second landlords, reluctantly endure. When unexpected things happen in the inland, they take advantage of the fire and rob three times the profit, which is painful to say.</p>
<p>Among the members of this association, I assume there are both second landlords and third tenants, so I propose this issue for everyone to discuss. How can we stop these tricky second landlords? This is my only hope.</p>
<p>Attached opinions</p>
<p>(1) In my opinion, each neighborhood or block should have the landlord, based on the rental price of the entire building, plus land tax, water and electricity fees, and a portion reserved for vacant rooms, set a price that both second and third tenants must comply with. If they increase it arbitrarily, their qualifications as second landlords will be revoked.</p>
<p>(2) The police authorities should pay close attention to the modification of houses in the neighborhood or block to avoid affecting hygiene and public safety.</p>
<p>Please decide whether the above two items are appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="e127">From "Leek Stir-Fry with Shredded Pork" to "Incense-Burning Old Lady" <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Hall Owner</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I went to a restaurant with four friends. One of my friends, Mr. A, liked to eat "leek stir-fry with shredded pork," so we ordered that dish.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. A suddenly asked a strange question: "People say that 'leek' is a meat dish, what's the reason?"</p>
<p>Mr. B continued, "Also, 'onion' and 'garlic' are also said to be meat dishes, I really don't know what the reason is?"</p>
<p>Mr. C, who likes to be funny, laughed and said, "Maybe Jesus has his own reasons."</p>
<p>Mr. D, who claimed to know, explained, "This is because of the smell. Because 'leek', 'onion', and 'garlic' all have a smelly taste."</p>
<p>Mr. A, who liked to eat "leek," thought that Mr. D's explanation was not sufficient, so he disagreed and said, "Then, why is 'stinky tofu' a vegetarian dish?"</p>
<p>Mr. C, who likes to be funny, said, "Really, if 'leek', 'onion', and 'garlic' are said to be meat dishes, then 'rice' and 'wheat' can also be said to be meat dishes. Wouldn't vegetarians starve to death?" Mr. B said, "Vegetarians are just deceiving people! Often some bad things are done by vegetarians!" Mr. D had just finished eating, and after hearing what Mr. B said, he put down his bowl and chopsticks and said, "This is called 'If you want to find a black-hearted person, look for them among vegetarians!'"</p>
<p>Seeing them saying one sentence each, I thought it was interesting, and after listening to the sentiments of Mr. B and Mr. D, I also joined the discussion and said:</p>
<p>"Probably these vegetarians are originally 'black-hearted people'? Because eating vegetarian food can reduce their sins, right? The strangest thing I find is this kind of 'incense-burning old lady.' When they go to the temple and meet their comrades, they always talk about the bad things their daughters-in-law do. They are always chanting Buddha's name while talking about how bad their daughters-in-law are. This is really absurd!"</p>
<p>When I got to this point, everyone had finished eating. Mr. A picked up a cup of tea, just about to kiss the cup, when he heard me talking about the evils of "incense-burning old ladies," so he put the cup of tea back and said, "Mr. Shen is right! In my hometown, there are two sayings, one is 'Speak ill of your daughter-in-law when entering the door, speak of oil tofu when leaving the door,' meaning that they speak ill of their daughters-in-law when they enter the temple door, and when they leave the temple door, they talk about how delicious the oil tofu in this temple is!"</p>
<p>After Mr. A finished speaking, the funny Mr. C chanted "Amitabha!" Everyone laughed when they heard it.</p>
