<h3 id="c29">五年計劃的先决問題（下）彬 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>在帝國主義與殘餘的封建勢力兩重桎梏之下。中國除了投入帝國主義的懷抱裏順受其支配而外。斷無發展的可能。農村經濟以地租與高利貸之榨取。及種種捐稅之剝削。與天災人禍之破壞。更加以資本主義先進國經濟勢力之伸入。崩潰過程日益加速。在都市一方面。更不待言。幾乎整個爲帝國主義經濟勢力所操縱支配。由於不平等條約之訂立。帝國主義者列强勢力範圍之劃分關稅率之低落。中國不僅是一個經濟破産生産落後的國家。而且已經淪爲一個先進資本主義國家經濟共管的殖民。地發展民族實業當然是我們不甘長淪於殖民地地位的民族主義者必然的要求。然而這一要求可能實現嗎。</p>
<p>目前一般人的主張。認爲中國現在的病根。在於實業不發達。要發展實業。必須「利用外資。」實業部現在的計劃。也正不出於這一途。所以籌設鋼鐵廠的第一着。便不得不向德國借資本八百萬元。利用外資發展本國實業。我們當然贊成。但是否有把握眞能利用呢。其實。在今日在世凋敝情勢之下。中國這塊還未開發的肥臠。資本主義列强正望着垂涎。即使中國不「借。」她們也極願意投資。從前美人林百克之進行十萬萬盎斯的銀借欵。以及國際聯盟發展中國交通開發中國實業的計劃。便是很顯明的證例。而「經濟復興自中國」的呼聲。對於開發中國的意義。更是露骨說明。所以投資與借債。就令眞能用之於開發實業。但在實質上。不過是更加强了列强經濟共管的意味。甚且由經濟共管進而爲政治共管。使中國走上比朝鮮印度還不如的黑暗之深淵罷了。這實業是中國的實業嗎。</p>
<p>我們認爲要發展民族實業。這裏只有一條路。即是必先用大衆的力量。對内掊覆殘餘封建勢力的根基。澄淸政治。形成一健全靈活而有力的政治組織。對外廢除一切不平等條約。解脫一切經濟的政治。的枷鎖。增高關稅壁壘。防止外貨的流入。使外國商品不能充斥於我市塲。在此種環境之下。再基於社會主義生産的原則。不借外債。但利用外國技術人材。集中國家的財力與人力於一個精確計劃之下。進行實業的發展。同時更須予全國人民以新的希望。鼓舞其生命的活力。使其共向一個偉大的目標前進。必這樣。而後可以發展實業。而後可以使我們落後的國家工業化。并逐漸走向光明的大路。</p>
<p>蘇聯的五年實業計劃。爲目前世界所注目。在整個凋敝世界之中。獨有蘇聯超出凋敝世界之外。而獲得飛躍突進。並不是偶然的。蘇聯經過了一次大的革命。經歷了極端難苦的奮鬥與努力。重新奠定了社會的基石。他們並不借用外資或乞助於别國的政府。以全國收入的一半。用之於五年計劃。他們把全國的經濟·丨丨工業。農業。與商業。生産。消費與分配。都統轄在一個經濟的總機關下。他們要用最少的人力達到人生必需品與娛樂口的最大産額。同時又使一切勞働者獲得健康安全敎育文化上的增進。每一個人都盡其本分。每一個人都刻苦耐勞。每一個人都從事於偉大的犧牲的事業。沒有一個人可以嘗得到玫瑰花的香味。在這種艱苦努力之下。大多數工業。已經超過每年所預期的目的了。有些在一九三三年才可以達到的目。標已經在一九三○年十月裏超過了。國家的收入。已經從一百二十三億元增加到二百四十八億元。即是說增加了百分之一○三這確實足以使我們健羡。然而這收穫。並不是偶然或輕易得來的呀。</p>
<p>我國現在確實需要發展實業。尤其是需要有計劃的發展實業。然而這計劃將怎樣擬成呢。將怎樣進行呢。而且又將能收穫一些什麽呢。我們不僅是懷疑。實在的。還帶着十分的憂慮與恐怖。</p>

<p>民國十七年我用上等宣紙裝訂了一本美麗的大簿子放在辦公棹上以備學生們質疑問難。這本簿子的封面貼了一條泥金的標簽，上面由我自己寫了『人生問題』四個字。簿子旁邊放了一張通告歡迎大家將各人心窩裏的問題寫出來使我可以預先考慮，再行答復。在美的簿上寫心中事是多麽有詩意的一回事啊！不消說得，雞脚字是不好意思寫在上面。我的目的是達到了：同學們每人來寫問題之先，必將問題裏面的一些字練習好多次，纔願下筆。所以我這本簿子不但是網維了如珠似玉的問題川流不息的來到而且寫問題的字無形中也就藝術化了。一天，我把人生問題簿翻開一看，發見了這樣一個問題：</p>
<p>『夫子的兒子敎學做可得而聞乎？』</p>
<p>這問題的涵義是豐富極了，給了一個很深刻的戟刺。從此以後我便時常自己問自己說：『兒子敎學做這門功課該如何去上？』現在把最近上的一課發表出來，以供有兒子的人們參考。</p>

<p>年來我國留學生。得博士頭銜回國炫耀者車載斗量。且一人而兼得二三博士者有之。前夕丁君折簡邀宴南園酒家。座中有朱張劉舊雨。朱亦美國經濟博士。飲次。張君談及砂仁博士。衆以語甚離奇。笑詰其由。張君歷言端末曰。數年前。有某甲者。性好狎邪。父爲顯宦。留德十年。從未赴校聽講。一再降級。舞塲妓館。留連忘返。同學咸誚薄之。不以齒。而某恬不知恥。嘗大言曰。得一博士。如探囊耳。何必孜孜乃爾。人以肆口濫詡能無汗顔難之。某憤然曰。爾儕目光如豆。不識賢豪。余以一月爲期。若不獲。誓不返國。言己拂袖而去。及歸庽。深悔是日出言之孟浪。復恨同學誚謗譏評。悒悒不樂。繞屋默思。罔知所計。忽憶中國街有一懸壺者。觸機而歎曰。噫。是可爲矣。怱怱走訪。乞假本草綱目。摭拾一方迻譯德文。題爲砂仁之效用。將本草中砂仁一物辨别溫辛性味。主治功用等撰成論文。提出研究院。院中學者。閱而奇之。嘖嘖稱絶。給砂仁博士學位。名大噪。張君談鋒甚銳。席中諸君莫不捧腹。張君所言是否可信。予亦不敢贊一詞。顧近年來以大蒜而得藥學博士。金汁而得理學博士者。殆皆若某博士之如法泡製。即本月日文報揭載中國人李某。以提出皮蛋論文。竟得理學博士。尤足以證所言之不謬也。</p>

<p>㈩㈡到濟南</p>
<p>除夕夜我們在徐州辭歲。也就是在江蘇境内最後的一刹那。這時候我的心靈似悲似歡。悲的是國勢日蹙。歡的是殺敵可期。最後我還回憶到慈祥的二親。愛我的姊姊。活潑的弟弟。以及忠誠的娘姨。但是。這般獃想了雖有大半個時辰。而結果終以暴日的可惡。沸騰了我的熱血。於是幻的想像都消滅了。重復了我那大無畏的意志。</p>
<p>元旦日下午。我們從徐州出發。至次日晨始抵濟南。站上有省代表迎接。但我們未曾下車。因爲團長對我們說。「聞這裏有倭賊的奸細。欲謀不利」云。未幾蒙市府賜贈饅頭及稀飯等食品到站。時我們各個的飢腸正如雷鳴。得此一飽。莫不欣感萬分。</p>
<p>寒鴉的哀號。風送到車廂裏來。蒼茫的暮色。漸漸地籠罩窗外的一切。一切都移滅了。但見燈光暉映着銀裝的道旁。不絶地吐露冽烈的寒威。許多同志都睡了。我仍舊獨自一人徬徨。驟然給我聽得一陣暴響聲。我禁不住跳下月台。出了車站一直跑向市街上。猛見得千百成羣的倭獸正在橫衝直撞。殺人的蓮蓬肉隨處亂飛。着了人便倒。着了房舍便火冒。我正欲回身報告團長。忽聽得斜街裏喚救命聲。我循着呼聲到了一家商店的内堂啊。可恨。一位女同胞正裸着下體。像將死的白鴿。因爲透不過氣。把兩翅亂撲一樣。和一個兇殘的暴賊掙扎。牀邊一個靑年冒着血滖在地上。我一時火盛。駡一聲「野獸休得無禮」。話未說完。領後却被拖着了。兩隻手也被繩綁住了。我轉過頭向内看。才認得又是一個獸兵。它一把着我出門。飄飄渺渺到一個所在。門口有一個招牌似乎寫着「濟南······」。這獸兵將我解到裏面。縛在一根柱子上。衹見獸影重重。圍着另一條柱上的同胞。不知所云吆喝了一會。末後一個一個把那同胞送上一拳而去了。一忽兒又來了幾隻橫肉滿面的大蟲。它見了這同胞耳靑目腫。身軟氣弱。却獰笑起來。有一個從腰間抽出槍刺。衹見它在那同胞面上一晃。一陣血湧。鼻子削下來了。我憤極將身一蹤。但聽得有人問道。「幹甚事幹甚事」。我將視線照向四壁。才知身地車廂裏面。我於是明白了五三慘案的恥辱是這般的·</p>

<p>我的滿足幾年來，依賴着許多親愛的觀衆們的讚美，我的地位也有了一個較好的長進；但是我自己却袛得到過一次的滿足，報紙上登滿了我的照片，不是我所滿足的；廣告上比碗口還大的我的名字，不是我所滿足的；一切奬勵我讚許我的紀念物，也不是我所滿足的。那麽，我所滿足的究竟是什麽呢？又何以僅僅袛有一次滿足呢？丨說起來，我不知將感激誰。丨原來在民國二十年的初夏的時候，明星公司中突然接到了許多不相識者的來信，這許多信，全部是寄給張石川和鄭正秋兩位先生的；發信人的地址呢，上海也有，東三省也有，北平也有，南洋也有；信裏面雖然是不同的辭句，但是有相同的意義。丨直到七月底，二三十天之中，一共接到了一百七十多封來信，全是說，「貴公司何不攝啼笑因緣？······以胡蝶飾何麗娜與鳳喜，······」呵！這是多麽使人奇突又使漸愧呢！至少，我有一百七十多個同情者了。這是我自上銀幕以來僅有的一次自己的滿足。</p>
<p>口以後的事攝製啼笑因緣的計劃確定了以後，我們便從事於工作開始的準備。我也偷着閑暇，把啼笑因緣這一部書看了一過。雖然我覺得有一時代的書中的鳳喜，不像是我所能表演的人，但事實是我必需勉力去承受這個繁得的工作了。記得那個時候，我所主演的「歌女紅牡丹」正在新光大戲院開映過，買了七天的滿座，自然我是很愉快的；有許多人都說是我的最美滿的作品，甚而有許多人說我應該把以前的作風變換一下而做一個像梨琳甘煦一樣的　人眼淚的表演者了。但是，爲了啼笑因緣的原故，我不大相信這個意見，我彷彿有些不自量，我也許有些過分的自信，丨要等到啼笑因緣成功了以後；讓親愛的觀衆給我以一個忠實的批評吧！丨丨</p>

<p>愚嘗言之。上海之表面。愈繁榮。而裏面之黑黯亦愈甚。其進展迨同一速度也。念秧爲搆成黑黯上海之一端。施行之術。日新而月異。使人防不勝防。爰述最近發生之一事。爲讀者告。福煦路有華達藥行者。以經理德國瑪爾大藥廠出品獅力牌牛肉汁雞汁爲大宗營業。近年銷路愈廣。遠及南洋恒。有人持現金來滬批購。四日晨。有自稱蘭谿祝裕隆號之代表。名胡福卿者。向該行批購牛肉汁六十打。雞汁一打。計實價九百餘元。胡出莊票一紙。其數爲一千兩。係恒隆出票。由上海安康錢莊照兌。八日期。於是該行與胡約定。八日兌欵。十日取貨。一千兩折洋有一千三百餘元。除去貨價外。尙多四百餘元。乃簽一江蘇銀行之支票。找付餘欵。支票書爲十二日期。以爲未有現金交付。保無他虞也。且該行批發向有九九扣之佣金。酬謝經手人。胡所批購之貨。實價九百餘元。即應給予九元數角之佣金。當時旣找付淸訖。此項佣金。本應付給。該行即以胡未有現金批購。不願以現金給佣。寗吃虧多給數角。亦簽予十二日期十元支票一紙。似此鄭重。念秧者流當無所施其技矣。詎事有出人意外者。胡携支票去後。竟將十二日塗改爲四日。向江蘇銀行兌欵。江蘇銀行不察。亦竟如數兌出四百餘元。迨被察覺。所謂胡福卿者。已杳如黃鶴。不知去向矣。該行姑持票往安康兌欵。則謂根票未到。直至十一日。始廢然不復往兌云。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第三回瑜亮同來竟使筵席易散尹邢相避不知鈿盒誰遺</p>
<p>現放着個花朶兒一般的梁笑雲在自己屋子裏。淺斟低酌。促膝談心。若被伊一脚跑來撞個正着。女性們器量褊狹。妒心又重。必使這兩位勢不相容的紅粧瑜亮。同時都眼内生釘。大不痛快。而夾在中間左右作難的却只是我一人。雖說梁笑雲或者還不便說什麽。那李問霞却是舌如利剪。口似懸河。向來不肯輕饒人的。何况又還被伊抓着一些兒錯。一定會在事後大興問罪之師。把一些古聖先賢的大道理搬出來。侃侃而談。責備我不該在此身遭大故的時候。還招惹些閑花野草瞞着人在屋裏飲酒作樂。將父母的寃仇。喪服中的哀痛。全然置諸腦後。忘了乾凈。試問心肝何在。大義何存。到那時伊是義正詞嚴。儘有說的。却敎我將什麽臉面相見。拿什麽言詞作答。不妙不妙。不能夠乾等着伊來扳我的差錯。招那許多的麻煩。趁現在時間還來得及。應趕快跑回房去藉故托詞。先把梁笑雲騙走。使伊二人永遠作一對避面的尹邢。才能免除一些無謂口舌。維持世界和平。想想事不宜遲。旋即氣急敗壞的跑回到屋子裏。見了端坐在席邊相候的梁笑雲。本待一啓齒就要請伊走的。不知怎樣竟又有些臨陣恇怯。一時問間嚅囁着開不出口。倒反而紫漲了臉。虚喘着氣。仍伏伏帖帖的陪伊坐了下去。梁笑雲一人在此枯坐了許久。本已有些感着寂寞和焦煩。正暗暗猜疑他不知是那一位要緊朋友來電話。竟使他手脚忙亂。怱怱就將伊冷淸淸地一人撇在這兒。連一點禮節都不講。及他跑回來了。細細再將他一端詳。又發見他的精神恍惚。面色倉皇。比先前更爲急劇。不免非常詫異。忍不住就要問道。你怎麽啦。剛才聽見有人來電話。就急忙得那個樣兒。聽完了回來。臉色又更加難看了。這電話究是誰打來的。說了些什麽。莫非你家裏有什麽新的信息來了麽。安玉田正愁不好說謊。被伊這一說。倒恰好替他開了一條路。就將話答話道。不錯的。是家鄕裏又來了一個人了。一會兒還要到這裏來。不過這人是一位老前輩。你在這兒。見了面怕不甚方便。所以我想和你商量。請你先走一步。明天我一定到你那地方去。多多的暢談一番。</p>

<p>走到馬路上，睜開兩眼一看，徧處都是吃的，着的，用的，消遣的，娱樂的，在物質享受方面，一切都爲你設備得很周密，很完備，有珠光寳氣的百貨公司，有窮極奢靡的大酒樓，有洋樓高聳的大旅館，有鑼鼓叮噹的大舞台，有「高尙娱樂」的考而夫球塲，有公開賭博的賽狗塲賽馬塲，有公開拍賣的人肉市塲，有跳舞廳，有俱樂部，有電影院，有茶樓，有烟館，有賭窟，有「天堂地獄」的××世界。總之在吃，着，用，消遣，娱樂方面，在上海，可以說是你要什麽便有什麽，只要你身邊有的是大洋錢。上海整天整晚在將每一個人往墮落的死路上拉，整天整晚在勸人犯罪，勸人作惡，但是當你已經堕落而成爲所謂「　三」或「乞丐」之後，在另一方面便爲你設有拘留所，監獄或「洋」牢。上海社會的設備是何等的周密啊</p>
<p>可是，在這裏，只准你吃，着，消遣，娱樂，却不准你用腦，却不准你求得精神上的食糧，不信偌大的上海，你看除了一所商務印書館附設的東主圖書館而外，你是否還可以找到第二處？</p>
<p>聽說倫敦，巴黎，紐約，東京，以及世界每個大都市都建設有很大的圖書館，藏着豐富的圖書，供全市人民研究閱讀。或者這便是所謂「西方文化」，咱們東方人不應學傻子的傻樣罷。</p>
<p>當我每回走過×世界以及×舞台時，心裏總存着這樣的傻念頭：「這裏，何時可以改爲一所偉大豐富的圖書館，而且閱書的人仍然是這樣的踴躍呢」？</p>

<p>五歳的男孩子，聰明伶俐，很得他的叔叔的歡心，一天到晚和叔叔同玩着。</p>
<p>那天，他喜歡叔叔的一柄小洋刀，他就取了玩着，一不留意割破了手指，滴了幾點血，痛得他哭了半天。</p>
<p>這天，他叔叔和他到一個殺猪作裏看殺猪，他覺得非常的新奇，睜大了眼睛注意着各種動作。</p>
<p>先是一個大力的屠夫，到後面棚子裏將一頭四蹄紮好的肥，猪一手拉鬆一手抓尾的提了出來，那猪只是狂呌着，掙扎着。他將牠在一條闊凳上一放，便有一個副手過來帮着，將牠按住了。他隨手將肉案上尖刀取了過來，用刀背在牠的咽喉上點了兩下，作一個勢，然後刀尖一轉，就此直刺進去。牠更是一陣狂呌，渾身袖搐着，等到他將刀抜出來，血便隨着刀尖向着盛在地下的水桶中直注。······</p>
<p>「哇······」孩子忽地大聲的哭了，回頭向叔叔的膝間亂躱。「痛呀」！喊着說。</p>
<p>叔叔連忙將他抱了起來，問他有什麽痛，他一面哭，一面回過頭來用手指指闊凳上：這時，那肥猪已是聲息全無，一動不動了。叔叔明白了，便安慰他說，「不要怕」，屠夫也笑着說，「這孩子膽子太小了，要是看見殺人，還不知怕到怎樣呢！」</p>
<p>孩子還是哭個不止，而且還喊着「痛呀！」他叔叔只好將他抱了回去。他父母見了他那個樣子，又聽他喊痛，起先不免也吃了一驚，後來知道了原因，才放了心。父親說，「痛什麽！你的手又沒有割破，痛在猪身上呢！」帶着訓斥的口氣。母親說，「乖兒子，不要哭明天去買牠的肉來給你吃，牠是殺來供人吃的」一片慈愛的心腸，溢於言表。</p>
<p>孩子好像什麽話都沒有聽，見始終只是哭着，喊着痛。</p>

<h3 id="c192">電燈泡的構造丁熙 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>大衆們！你們住在這個繁華熱鬧的街市裏，到了每天的晚上就看見街頭的電燈，發出燦爛的火光，比那洋燭和煤油燈要亮得多，你們旣然能夠看見這種好燈光，現在可要知道這個東西是誰發明的呢？是怎樣構造的呢？假使不曉得，請將我這篇短文讀下去，就可以明白了。</p>
<p>西曆１８８２年美國科學大家愛迪生（Ｅｄｉｓｏｎ）用條細白的金絲，封在玻璃泡内，通以電，流那知電流，一通金絲和玻璃泡，統被燒掉。了那時候他的心中，非常煩悶，因爲想不出法子，把電燈泡製造成功。但是，他想『世上無難事，只怕有心人』，無論如何一定要打破這種難關，把電燈泡製造成功。他便苦苦的試騐了好多次，用個喞筒將玻璃泡内的空氣抽出，再裝上白金絲通電，便發出燦爛的火光來，而且能燒得很久，這時候他心中的煩悶才解除，電燈泡總算製成功了。</p>
<p>到後來他又想想白金絲是世界上最貴的金屬，比黃金還要貴幾倍，用來作燈絲，將來不但銷路不廣，且太不經濟。他動手重新改良，用一種竹的纖維，煉成炭絲，來替代白金絲，試騐的結果，非但能耐久，而又價廉，他便利用這種炭絲裝在電燈泡裏。</p>
<p>最後他又想到：炭絲雖是比金絲便宜，而發出的光不十分明亮，且又費電，於是又重行改良，發見一種鎢絲可以用來替代炭絲，發光旣强，價値又不貴。現在這種鎢絲的燈泡，就通行於各國了。</p>
<p>鎢絲的燈泡是用玻璃做成球狀，中間安有一根玻璃棒和盤旋連續不斷極細的鎢絲。鎢絲的兩端是各和較粗的兩根銅絲相連。這兩根銅絲一根是接在燈泡的頂部，又一根是接在燈泡的傍邊，若燃點時，電流便由一根電綫通入燈絲，由另一根電綫出去。鎢絲的電阻力，非常的大，電流通過這電阻力大的傳導體上，便變成熱，熱至極點，就發出光來。</p>
<p>鎢絲旣然有這樣高的熱度，何以不會燒斷呢？這是因爲泡内空氣在製造時用喞筒抽出，裏面沒有養氣助燃燒，所以鎢絲也不會因熱而燒斷，我們若把手觸在電燈泡的外面，衹覺得微熱，這也是因爲泡内衹有稀少的空氣，傳出少量的熱，所以我們手觸燈泡祇覺微熱。</p>

<p>剛剛是括了冷北風的第二天早晨，天氣分外的寒冷。我們乘了一路電車一直到公園靶子塲去赴一位朋友的約會。回來的時候，Ｃ君怱怱忙忙的對我說：「我第一次看見！我第一次看見！你們看見沒有？</p>
<p>我聽了莫名其所以，連忙問他什麽事。他說：「竟有人在北四川路底出賣兒子！」接着，他又斷斷續續的說：我初聽見了，沒有在意，就走過去了。走到了外國學堂那里的時候，隱隱的在暮色蒼茫的冷風中，還可以很淸晰的聽到他悽慘的呌聲。他喊着：『賣孩子啊！有那個要孩子囉？」那種尖銳的呌聲太悽慘了，我不忍聞！我不忍聞！』</p>
<p>這眞太悽慘了，天下還眞有賣孩子的事情。我問他那個賣孩子的人是什麽臉相。他說：「北方人是一個高高的，面龐粗黑的大漢。身上着了藍布大褂他一聲高一聲低的呌賣着。旁邊有一個三十來歳的女，人手廟抱着一個孩子，地上還蹲着三個。」</p>
<p>說完，大家說一聲「苦來兮！」接着就有人說：「這人是個阿木林，只蹲在冷靜無人的北四川路底呌賣，恐怕凍死了也沒有人給他錢。如果在大馬路，他倒可以賺一筆錢！」</p>
<p>過不了幾，天這賣兒子的人突然在黃昏時光到我們寓所附近來呌賣了！這顫慄的，悽慘的呌聲在黑暗中惶惶忽忽的蕩漾着，倒使我吃了驚。Ｃ君連忙說：「就是這個人了，他的呌聲和前次一樣。」於是大家凑了一些錢給他。彼此談論着說：「眞的，這人靠賣兒子倒可以在上海發一筆洋財了，誰個當眞去買他的孩子。」「然而，他賣孩子總是眞的，如果我去買，他可以不賣給我麽？」其中一個說。</p>
<p>「眞的」我心裏也這樣想。第二天的晚上賣孩子的人又來了，他仍然和昨天一樣在街頭悽慘的呌着，但誰也沒有理他。他是利用他的兒子來討錢了。</p>
<p>有一位朋友說：「中國人窮到賣小孩子，還是怨自己的命，苦並不怨恨到誰，也就夠痛心了啊！」</p>

<p>一天我闖進××號的大南貨店裏去買一點東西，我呌的名字，和他們呌的不同，所以那夥計拿出來的東西，也就不是我所要買的東西，『我就對他夥計一說：』「不是這個，請你替我換一換，」可是他對我怎樣說：「你下回來買東西，得先問問淸爽，你說差了，要我去換，要我要費多少手脚······，橫堅一樣的好吃，這不是差不多的麽，」我很堅决地一定要他去換，終於替我換了來，可是他還咕噥着不休呢。</p>
<p>又一次，我走過一家法國人開的麵包店，順便彎進去買幾個麵包，見一個穿短褂子的同胞，先我在那裏購買東西，在他面前的櫃上，放了三大袋的麵包，後來算賬了，他說要這麽貴啊？我不要了，結果二百大錢買了一個麵包，當他臨走的時候，店裏的那個法國人，你可知道怎樣？他還裝着笑容，說了一句很强硬的Ｔｈａｎｋｙｏｕ，</p>
<p>在這時我不禁起了一種劇烈的感想，開店做老闆的，用你們一般夥計站在櫃台裏做甚麽？當然是要替老闆的手脚，替老闆招來生意，那末，光臨的主顧，無論交易多，交易少，都是寳號裏的顧客，須得殷勤招待，未便無端得罪，這就是做生意的經絡。</p>
<p>買差了東西，就換一換，有甚麽難事，費多少手脚，嘮嘮叨叨的說了一大堆的話；這眞是令人氣憤不過，同時外人做生意，見他怎樣地客氣，裝好了三大袋的麵包，聽他說不要了便，一句話都沒有的拿了回去，（並不是不會說中國話，也並不是不會說嘔氣的話）難道他不費手脚的嗎？</p>
<p>夥計們！要招來主顧麽？不應該用這樣的態度對待顧客，不須要主顧的嗎？請問你們的老闆，掛起了招牌，開着了大門，用你們一般夥計到底爲些什麽？我並不是甘心做洋奴，願意說外國人好，這事實確是這樣的。</p>

<p>×泥城之戰</p>
<p>商團成立末久，即與官軍發生衝突。淸廷特派江蘇署按察吉爾杭阿，爲新閘駐軍之統帶，所部有二三萬人，吉爾杭阿爲旗人，又屬文官，本不知兵，以爲統兵數萬當無難事。，新閘營房與租界西端密接少數兵士潛入租界，與外人小有衝突，實意中事，兵士又在租界西練習打靶，流彈間有射入今日跑馬廳西藏路一帶租界内者，於是外人遂藉此爲口實，决與官軍挑釁。開始要求吉爾杭阿將軍營移置城南，吉爾杭阿置之不理。</p>
<p>一八五四年（咸豐四年）四月四日淸晨，英領阿爾苛克即致哀的美頓書於吉爾杭阿，謂新閘之軍營，限於午后四點移開，如不移營，即以武力攻擊。吉爾杭阿覆書謂移營事請從長計議，望勿遽起爭端。外人遂認此種覆書爲拒絶其要求，即於午后三時，召集商團與外兵於英國敎堂之前集合，得三百八十人。據美國樸萊茅斯號艦長開列Ｃａｐｔ·Ｋｅｌｌｙ所紀當時外兵集合情形云：</p>
<p>『我軍於午后三時登陸，有七十五人，英軍登陸者二百人，商團盡係英人，遂與英軍聯合，美僑以野戰砲二尊來歸我指揮，我軍遂增至一百人，英軍又增至二百五十人，又有美國商船水手三十人加入我軍。』</p>
<p>當時英美軍隊及義勇軍共計不過三百八十人，以恩康特爾艦長歐卡拉罕（ＯＣａｌｌａｇｈａｍ）及副艦長杜（Ｄｅｗ）統率英兵·以前充連副之衛德（Ｔ·Ｆ·Ｍａｄｅ即英副領事）統率商團，以開列統率美軍。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke stated that the central government's finances are still difficult. Although the banking sector has agreed to provide 8 million [currency unspecified] per month, it is still far from sufficient. Efforts are still being made. The central government previously issued financial bonds, but the original amount of the bonds was 80 million [currency unspecified]. Because the Ministry of Finance owed the Central Bank a huge 50 million [currency unspecified], it mortgaged the bank. In the future, the government will use other collateral to redeem the bonds for use as collateral for the current loan from the Shanghai Banking Syndicate. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Tiecheng discussed the government's borrowing from the Shanghai banking syndicate. In the initial stage, the government proposed 10 million [currency unspecified] per month, but the syndicate only agreed to undertake 5 million [currency unspecified]. After some mediation, a compromise was reached at 7.5 million to 8 million [currency unspecified], limited to two months. Both sides have reached a good understanding. Minister Huang will directly discuss the procedures for mortgages and repayment. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Under the dual yoke of imperialism and the remaining feudal forces, China has no possibility of development other than submitting to and being dominated by imperialism. The rural economy, with its exploitation through land rent and usury, as well as various taxes and levies, and the destruction caused by natural disasters and man-made calamities, coupled with the encroachment of the economic forces of advanced capitalist countries, is experiencing an increasingly rapid collapse. In urban areas, it goes without saying that almost everything is manipulated and dominated by the economic forces of imperialism. Due to the establishment of unequal treaties, the division of spheres of influence by imperialist powers, and low tariff rates, China is not only an economically bankrupt and backward country but has also been reduced to a colony under the joint economic control of advanced capitalist countries. Naturally, the development of national industries is a necessary demand for nationalists who are unwilling to remain in a colonial state for long. However, is this demand achievable?</p>
<p>Currently, the general opinion is that the root cause of China's problems lies in the underdevelopment of industry. To develop industry, it is necessary to "utilize foreign capital." The current plan of the Ministry of Industry is precisely based on this approach. Therefore, the first step in establishing a steel plant is to borrow 8 million yuan in capital from Germany. We certainly support the utilization of foreign capital to develop domestic industries. But can we be sure that it can truly be utilized? In fact, in today's declining global situation, capitalist powers are eyeing this fertile, undeveloped land of China with great desire. Even if China does not "borrow," they are very willing to invest. The previous attempt by the American businessman Lin Baek to secure a loan of 100 million ounces of silver, as well as the League of Nations' plans to develop China's transportation and industry, are clear examples of this. And the call for "economic revival from China" blatantly illustrates the meaning of developing China. Therefore, even if investment and borrowing can truly be used to develop industries, in essence, it will only strengthen the meaning of joint economic control by the powers, and even lead to political joint control from economic joint control, pushing China into a dark abyss even worse than Korea and India. Is this industry really China's industry?</p>
<p>We believe that to develop national industries, there is only one path: we must first use the power of the masses to internally dismantle the foundation of the remaining feudal forces, purify politics, and form a sound, flexible, and powerful political organization. Externally, we must abolish all unequal treaties, break free from all economic and political shackles, raise tariff barriers, and prevent the influx of foreign goods, ensuring that foreign commodities cannot flood our markets. Under such circumstances, based on the principles of socialist production, without borrowing foreign debt but utilizing foreign technical talent, we should concentrate the country's financial and human resources under a precise plan to develop industries. At the same time, we must give the people of the whole country new hope, inspire their vitality, and make them move forward together towards a great goal. Only in this way can we develop industries, industrialize our backward country, and gradually move towards the bright road.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Five-Year Industrial Plan has attracted global attention. In the midst of a completely declining world, only the Soviet Union stands outside of it, achieving rapid progress. This is not accidental. The Soviet Union underwent a major revolution, experienced extremely difficult struggles and efforts, and re-established the cornerstone of society. They do not borrow foreign capital or beg for help from other countries' governments. Half of their national income is used for the Five-Year Plan. They place the entire national economy, including industry, agriculture, and commerce, production, consumption, and distribution, under a central economic agency. They want to use the least amount of manpower to achieve the maximum output of essential necessities and entertainment, while also providing all workers with health, safety, education, and cultural advancement. Everyone does their duty, everyone is hardworking and enduring, and everyone is engaged in the cause of great sacrifice. No one can taste the fragrance of roses. Under these arduous efforts, most industries have already exceeded their annual targets. Some goals that were to be achieved in 1933 have already been surpassed in October 1930. The country's income has increased from 12.3 billion yuan to 24.8 billion yuan, which is an increase of 103%. This is indeed enough to make us envious. However, this harvest is not accidental or easily obtained.</p>
<p>Our country now truly needs to develop industry, especially planned industrial development. However, how will this plan be formulated? How will it be carried out? And what will it achieve? We are not only skeptical; in reality, we are filled with worry and fear.</p>

He is responding to the inquiry to dispel doubts.

<p>Minseito Party Scorns Government's Autocratic Policy towards China</p>
<p>Proletarian Parties Unite to Prepare for Decisive Battle</p>
<p>Kokumin Tokyo, 22nd - After Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi dissolved the parliament, he is now appealing to the country to support his domestic, financial, and China policies and to elect members of the Seiyukai Party in the general election. The Minseito Party has also issued a statement, criticizing Inukai Tsuyoshi's government for dissolving the parliament, reimposing the gold embargo, and adopting an autocratic attitude towards China. Seiyukai leaders are now preparing to compete with 330 candidates and expect to win 250 of the 466 seats in the House of Representatives. The Seiyukai Party only had 170 seats in the dissolved parliament. The Minseito Party is now having former Minister of Finance Inoue handle the general election with the assistance of ten committee members.</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 22nd - After yesterday's dissolution of parliament, the Minseito Party held a meeting of former Diet members to discuss future countermeasures and issued the following statement: "The Inukai Cabinet, which has destroyed political morality and the national economy, could not withstand the legitimate arguments of the Imperial Diet and has blocked freedom of speech and dissolved the House of Representatives. At the beginning of its formation, the Inukai Cabinet banned the export of gold, allowing some financial cliques to reap windfall profits, destroying the gold standard, and causing prices to rise. Regarding the lèse-majesté incident, Prime Minister Inukai also admitted that he should transcend policy and completely submit, but under the pretext of the Emperor's order, he shamelessly remained in office, trampling on the great righteousness of nation-building, which is resented by the people. Our party must overthrow this shameless Inukai Cabinet and do everything possible to bring about a new opportunity for national regeneration."</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 23rd - The Labor-Farmer Masses Party and the Social Masses Party issued a joint statement after the dissolution of parliament: "Whether the government is in the hands of the Seiyukai or the Minseito, there is no difference in their role as agents of bourgeois politics. There is no doubt that the general election will be interfered with, but we are determined to start a resolute and decisive struggle to uphold the right to life of the proletariat."</p>

<h3 id="e68">Italy's Attitude Towards Disarmament <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Advocating for Limiting the Arms Race</p>
<p>Peng Gu'er Appointed Chairman of the French Delegation</p>
<p>Rome Dispatch, 21st: It is deemed necessary for the Italian delegation to announce at the Geneva Disarmament Conference that it will reduce, or even limit, armaments. Since the global economic panic, Europe's armaments have been severely affected, and countries can no longer afford to compete in armaments. This kind of competition consumes a nation's boundless wealth. The Italian government is willing to spare no expense to avoid it. Recently, Italian Foreign Minister Grandi's visit to the United States was for the success of the Disarmament Conference. Since Austria's decline, Italy's fear has been France, whose wealth and power far exceed Italy's, and which has the support of the alliance countries of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Therefore, Italy cannot but consider these imagined enemies when thinking about its military strength. The Italian government believes that if all countries can reduce armaments at the same time, there is no need for each to maintain military strength to counter each other. The views expressed by Grandi during this visit to the United States also serve as a guarantee for disarmament, which is better than countering each other with military strength, as mutual antagonism easily creates an arms race. The recent plan for a one-year armistice was actually initiated by Grandi. The Italians believe that this move can clarify the atmosphere of the Geneva Conference next month. All countries should taste the benefits of reducing military spending this time, and will definitely trust the disarmament policy more. Furthermore, Grandi recently stated to journalists that disarmament should be reduced to the lowest possible level as much as possible, and even if it cannot reach the lowest level, we should greatly reduce it, so that the conference can have some results. Italy's aspirations can be seen in his words.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, Paris: It was said that the Chief Representative of France to the Disarmament Conference would be assumed by the Minister of War, Taidi'ou, but today's news is that Peng Gu'er has been appointed as the Chief Representative of France. Briand and Laval will not attend in Geneva. Briand claimed that he could not leave Paris due to ill health, and Laval cited the government's busy schedule as the reason for not being able to go to Geneva in person. Reuters, 22nd, Beijing: The Belgian Minister of National Defense, Deng Si, said in a speech in the Senate today that he will go to Geneva to participate in the Disarmament Conference. He sincerely hopes for peace, but must protect the security of Belgium. Due to its geographical relationship, Belgium has to make earnest preparations, so Belgium cannot be a world model for disarmament, he said.</p>

<p>Internal Disagreement Arises</p>
<p>MacDonald Cancels Trip to Paris</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, London: Prime Minister MacDonald declined to meet with French Prime Minister Laval in Paris, Foreign Secretary Sir Simon canceled his trip to Geneva, and all cabinet members cut off all social engagements. The political circles view this as a sign that the cabinet has experienced major disagreements regarding financial policy. It is heard that Viscount Snowden and Home Secretary Samuel both hold free trade beliefs, and are now making great efforts to oppose the adoption of a broad tax procedure. It is heard that the tax rate opinions presented by the cabinet members' committee advocate first levying emergency taxes of 10 to 15 percent, pending the establishment of another committee to formulate higher tax rates for non-essential imports. If there were no opposition from Shi Miao, it could be adopted by the cabinet. Snowden's faction believes that since the domestic situation has greatly changed since the suspension of the gold standard, it still strongly advocates free trade. Because of this, the cabinet meeting held this morning was watched very closely, fearing that it would be one of the biggest challenges since the establishment of the National Government. It is generally believed that the Prime Minister will do his best to use his skills and reconcile the various opinions to achieve success. The telegram continued, the cabinet met for a long time, and after the meeting, according to the official announcement, the cabinet members could not reach a unanimous decision on the opinions of the shareholder committee.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, London: According to the gazette, the cabinet, in view of the importance of maintaining the unity of the country, decided to slightly modify the usual practices of the cabinet, and decided that cabinet members who do not agree with the majority of their colleagues on the import tax issue and similar events may freely express their opinions through speeches and votes. With this change, it is clear that the resignation of the cabinet is no longer an issue. It is heard that the cabinet now agrees on all other matters of policy, so cabinet members all believe that the measures announced in the gazette best represent the aspirations of the whole country.</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, London: Because Prime Minister MacDonald is tied up with government affairs, he cannot go to France. He has now formally invited French Prime Minister Laval to come to London for talks at the end of this week. Reuters learned that the British government had instructed the British ambassador to Germany to suggest to the German government that the current plan to suspend payments related to Europe be extended indefinitely, but the German government has firmly rejected it. According to news from Paris, French Prime Minister Laval urgently needs to meet with the British Prime Minister due to new developments in the reparations issue, and hopes to arrive in London at the end of this week.</p>

<p>Rebel Party Occupies Three Towns in the Northeast Province</p>
<p>Organizes a Communist Republican Government</p>
<p>The Government Proclaims its Ability to Suppress the Chaos</p>
<p>Reuters, 22nd, Madrid: The tide of resistance against the Spanish government is getting worse today, threatening to overthrow the current regime. The most alarming development is the declaration of the establishment of a Communist Republic in three towns including Salente in the northern part of Barcelona Province. In these three towns, the revolutionary party operates freely, all industries are shut down, and all public places are occupied. The rebel party has issued a declaration of the Spanish Communist Republic. A general strike broke out today in Manlese in the northern part of the province, all traffic was cut off. The rebel party occupied the central telephone bureau in Navasuzes, and seized the gunpowder bureau in Salente. In addition to revolutionary strikes in many cities and towns, wherever the Catholic Church has power, it is also very much against the government's plan to deal with the churches in the provinces. The rebel party in Manlese bombarded the civilian military barracks with bombs, killing and injuring many people, and demolished nearby rails, causing the train to derail. The red flag has now been hung in the city hall of Manlese. The Communist Party in Cordoba Province is also thinking of rioting. The governor has dispatched troops and police to guard all important places as a precaution. The city of Barcelona is surrounded by a large number of civilian troops today, preparing for the rebel party to attack. Tonight, Madrid Radio issued a report that a restoration conspiracy had been discovered on the French border. The Congress is still supporting the government. After the Prime Minister reported that severe laws must be adopted to maintain peace, the Congress passed a vote of confidence in the government with a majority of 285 votes to 4 votes. The cabinet held a special meeting this afternoon and decided to actively find ways to restore public order. Prime Minister A Chai Na announced that the revolutionary movement would be cracked down by the strictest methods, and special privileges would be granted to the provincial governors, and all officials who are disloyal to the Republic would be replaced immediately. Today it was learned that the Communist Party, in implementing its revolutionary general strike plan, tried to induce the help of the restorationists, and did not hesitate to forge a notice from the National Federation of Trade Unions. The National Federation of Trade Unions has now warned workers not to fall for it. The government has sent troops to the troubled areas in separate directions. A certain cafe in Barcelona was a gathering place for the rebel party. The police searched and arrested 60 people, and arrested more people in the trade union.</p>
<p>National News Agency, 21st, Madrid: Six towns in Barcelona Province have been occupied by 15,000 revolutionary strikers. These people plundered the military equipment of the village defense teams, demolished railways, and the momentum is increasing day by day. According to Prime Minister A Chai Na's declaration in Congress today, the government has detected that parties in Spain and abroad are trying to launch an uprising on the 25th to overthrow the Republic. The people were terrified when they heard this. News came from Selona that the government forces had defeated the rebels in Baijia. The government is now taking strict plans to defend the Spanish Republic and curb the conspiracies of restoration or communism. Manlisa is the center of the turbulent area, and five battalions of infantry and one battalion of artillery have been sent to suppress it. Troops have also been sent to other turbulent areas. The government is confident of suppressing the chaos. According to the Prime Minister, the national army is now loyal to the government, and there is nothing to worry about, he said. Many rioters have been arrested in recent days and will be tried for treason. According to the latest news, government forces and revolutionary forces are engaged in fierce fighting in the turbulent areas of Barcelona Province.</p>

It was resolved to leave the original regiment and compile it into a Government Guard Regiment and submit it to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Military and Political Department for compliance.</p>

<p>Yu Shenzhen's Troops are Advancing towards Wuchang</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the war broke out in the Yushu area, Zhang Jinghui telegraphed Bin County, the Provincial Government, and the Jilin Puppet Governor's Office, asking for a peaceful resolution and not to meet each other with weapons. Yesterday, Xi Qia sent his secretary Jin Wuxuan to Harbin to see Zhang and listen to Zhang's methods. In addition to sending his advisor Lei Chun to Yushu Shulan two days ago to persuade the two sides to temporarily stop the attack, after Xi Qia's representative arrived, he also telegraphed Cheng Yun, the acting chairman of the Bin County Provincial Government, asking him to send a representative to discuss the matter. Soon, he received a reply telegram from Cheng Yun, saying that he had sent Li Shuzi, the general manager of the Harbin Electric Power Bureau, as a representative to discuss everything. Zhang Jinghui had already discussed with Xi Qia's representative Jin Wuxuan once last night. It is heard that Zhang intends to ask both parties to stop military action first, and then divide the entire province into two parts, which will be respectively governed by the Jilin Puppet Governor's Office and the Provincial Government of Bin County, and the taxes will also be apportioned separately. The two parties will temporarily maintain the status quo, and further consultations will be held after the overall situation has changed. Tonight at 9 pm, Zhang plans to invite Jin Wuxuan and Li Shuzi to Huayuan</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Zhang's private residence to discuss. However, it is heard that if Xi Qia's side terminates military action, the two sides can not invade each other. Otherwise, Ning will move the Provincial Government elsewhere and will never surrender. Cheng Yun had telegraphed Zhang Zuoxiang the day before, asking to move the Provincial Government to Yilan. Zhang has not yet replied. If the Japanese aircraft drop bombs again, the Provincial Government will inevitably move to Yilan or other remote counties for safety reasons. As for the Provincial Political Discussion Meeting, it has been adjourned without being held due to the Japanese aircraft bombing. Representatives from various places have also returned to their respective counties. Xi Qia's puppet Bandit Suppression Commander Yu Shenzhen sent a letter to the Bin County Provincial Government a few days ago, claiming that he would be restricted to withdrawing from Bin County before the 17th, otherwise he would bomb with aircraft and launch a general attack. Now, the Bin County Provincial Government has transferred back two battalions of the Guard Corps of Feng Zhanhai's troops stationed in Acheng to defend. Xi Qia, with insufficient strength compared to the Jilin armies, specially negotiated with the Kwantung Army Department and agreed to borrow six heavy artillery pieces to be distributed to Yu Shenzhen's army for the general attack on Wuchang and Shuangcheng. Ten Japanese aircraft in Changchun were divided into two teams. One team flew to Shulan and one team flew to Yushu on the 13th to help Yu Shenzhen's army attack. Yu Shenzhen's army, about 4,000, has advanced to 70 miles south of Wuchang. Because the 26th Brigade's Yu De Yi Regiment and a part of Feng Zhanhai's Regiment are stationed in Wuchang, and the militia is defending together, they have not yet launched an attack. Another surprise soldier appeared at Sanchahe, south of Shuangcheng County, early in the morning on the 13th. They clashed with the 22nd Brigade's Su Dechen's troops for about an hour and were repelled by Su's Brigade. Yesterday, the sound of guns and artillery was very intense south of Shuangcheng. Residents in the city all fled to Harbin. The rebel army retreated today, and the county town was safe. Three Japanese armored vehicles drove out of Changchun yesterday, saying that they were protecting the International Transportation Agency's carriage transport vehicles. The destination of departure was Sanchahe, seemingly to cover the rebel army's attack again. However, there has been no contact today. Xi Qia's newly compiled 3rd Security Brigade, Ma Xilin's troops, about 1,000, advanced from Shulan towards Yushu. On the night of the 12th, they fought fiercely with the 25th Brigade's Liu Regiment and the 26th Brigade's Song Regiment in Xiushuidianzi, south of Yushu. By 2 am on the 13th, the rebel army was defeated and retreated. Two Japanese aircraft dropped bombs at noon on the 13th. It is heard that the 25th Brigade was heavily bombed and has retreated into Yushu City to defend. Zhang Zuozhou, the commander of the 25th Brigade, because of blocking Ma's army's advance, has detoured from the east of Yushu to attack Ma's army's rear in Shulan. The war broke out in Shulan County in the morning on the 13th. More than a thousand remnants of Ma's army were surrounded. Several Japanese aircraft dropped bombs today to relieve the siege. So far, no definite news has been obtained. It is heard that Ding Chao and Xing Zhanqing have decided to transfer all the troops under their jurisdiction to aid. They can start tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. (January 14)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Sun Lianzhong's Troops Captured Zhu De <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>One Division of Sun's Troops Secretly Escaped into Tingzhou</p>
<p>Zhu De was Lured and Captured Alive</p>
<p>Bandits in the Fujian-Guangdong Border are Still Rampant</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In recent times, the counties in northern Fujian have been attacked by more than 10,000 Red Bandits from the Gan Border, led by Zhu De, along with Luo Binghui, You Tingxuan, Fang Zhimin, and Shao Shiping. They successively captured Changting, Liancheng, Ninghua, and Chong'an counties. The newly compiled 2nd Division, Lu Xingbang's troops, Lu Xinming's Brigade, was defeated in Liancheng and retreated to Yong'an. The bandit army also advanced from Liancheng towards Yong'an. The two sides are currently in a stalemate, and the situation is very tense. In the middle of last month, it was suddenly reported that a division of Sun Lianzhong's troops of the Central Army in southern Jiangxi had rebelled, about 10,000 people, and entered Changting from Huichang Ruijin. The original flags and symbols were all destroyed, and the attitude was extremely secretive. The Red Bandits in Tingzhou were also confused. They retreated to the countryside. After Sun's troops entered Tingzhou City, they declared their willingness to cooperate with the Red Bandits and asked them to return to the city to hold a soldiers' get-together. The Red Bandits thought it was sincere and returned to the city from the countryside, and posted slogans welcoming Sun's troops. Unexpectedly, when the bandit army entered the city and was holding a meeting, they were surrounded by Sun's troops and had half of their guns confiscated. The rest of the bandits fought in melee and fled the city. According to Lu Xingbang's telegram to the Provincial Government yesterday, according to the sentry in Ruijin, Sun's troops in Huichang, under the guise of cooperating with the Red Bandits, asked Zhu De to go to the meeting to discuss the method, and Zhu De was captured on the spot. Zhu's troops collapsed, and a group fled into the Fujian border. Please send troops to intercept them quickly, etc. If true, the Fujian-Jiangxi border will be less of a major disaster. However, since the Sino-Japanese incident, the 49th Division troops in Shanghang, Yongding, Wuping, and Pinghe counties in western Fujian, which are adjacent to the Guangdong border, have been deployed to the coastal Haileng Longxi Zhangpu counties due to the tense situation. Only the militia was left behind, and the local reds took the opportunity to rise again, led by Zhang Dingcheng. They first occupied Yongding, levied able-bodied men, and formed a Red Guard to carry out guerrilla warfare. Now, except for the county towns, Shanghang and Wuping counties have become red areas, and they are in contact with the Red Bandits in Changting, and the situation is very rampant. (January 19)</p>

<p>Requesting the Same Enlistment</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Liu Guitang surrendered, small bandits from all over have responded one after another, vying to send representatives to Dawenkou to contact Liu, willing to surrender to the Provincial Government together. At present, in addition to Liu (Guitang) and Guo (Wensheng), Yin Shigui, Yin Shixi, Bai Fengxing, Song Chaosheng, etc. have arrived in Dawenkou. Those who have not arrived include Zhang Heilian, Li Douyin, Shi Zengfu, Wang Changyou, Gao Wanglun, Yang Guangsheng, etc. There are still more than 8,000 bandits in Gaotang area. Liu has sent Zhai Zhongyu to contact them. Also, the Rizhao Ban bandits Ding Jifang, Shi Yucheng, He Xiangshan, Zeng Futing, etc., also have more than 2,000 people with complete firearms, and have also sent representatives to Wenkou to contact. There are also more than 2,000 troops of Xue Chuanfeng in the Zoucheng Puyang area. The leader Li Yueru also sent representatives to Wenkou to contact Liu Guitang. Near Tai'an, 40 miles away from Bianjia Yuan, there is a small group of about 200 people, and the leader is called Commander Zheng. Liu Guitang has sent Guo Zhisan to recruit them. Liu Guitang and Guo Mafeng, etc., are known as large bandits in Shandong. Once they surrender, other small bandits dare not come out of the mountains, and there is no other way but to join Liu. Now, the various troops gathered in Dawenkou will reach 6,000 people, and it is still unknown how many are coming in continuously. Dawenkou and the surrounding areas inside and outside the Weicheng are mostly full. (January 20)</p>

<p>Anqing Correspondence: Wuyuan, southern Anhui, was previously captured by the Red Bandits who fled from Jiangxi. It has not been long since it was recovered, but recently there has been a sudden urgent news. It is heard that the Cao Men in the southern countryside of the county has been occupied by more than 1,000 Red Bandits, and they are trying to advance north. The Provincial Government received the news and has telegraphed the 55th Division to suppress them nearby. At the same time, in western Anhui, Kuang Jixun, Xu Jixin, etc., led the Red Bandits to attack Liuan and Huoqiu fiercely. It is heard that after Kuang Bandit attacked Huangpi and was repelled by the armies in Hubei, he and Xu Jixin and Xiao Fang split up and fled east. Kuang led more than 10,000 people and went straight northeast from the border of Hubei and Henan. He arrived in Liuan County at the beginning of the month and occupied Mabu and Qingshan on the west bank of the Pi River. On the 16th, he had crossed the Pi River and attacked Liuan County. The various agencies in the county are in a state of emergency, and have urgently telegraphed Chen Tiaoyuan and Li Mingzhong, asking them to send troops to support quickly. After Chen Tiaoyuan received the telegram, he telegraphed Yue Shengxuan, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in western Anhui, and others, urging the 46th Division and the 1st and 2nd Security Brigades stationed in the western Anhui area to suppress them quickly. As for the Huoqiu area, it is currently heard that it is also extremely urgent, because Xu Jixin and others hope to attack Huoqiu and open up the transportation route to Changhuai. The troops stationed in the county have retreated to the northern countryside. (January 20)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Zai Tao Denies Rumor of Going to Shenyang <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Puyi’s Actions Entirely Bewitched by Zheng Xiaoxu and Others</p>
<p>Since Puyi was coerced to Dalian by the Japanese, the clamor for restoration has become increasingly loud. Reports say Puyi has gone from Tanggangzi to Shenyang to prepare for restoration and that Zai Tao, residing in Peiping, has been summoned by telegram to Shenyang to organize a guard army. A reporter from Peiping visited Zai Tao at his residence in Shanlao Hutong yesterday and inquired about this matter. Zai Tao said the following: "Before the abdication of the Qing Dynasty, I was indeed a member of the military. Now, I have long abandoned military affairs and turned to literary pursuits, reading and painting every day, with nothing else to do. As a close relative of the Qing imperial family, I was ordered to stay in Peiping after the abdication of the Emperor, shouldering two major responsibilities: 1. Guarding the Eastern and Western Mausoleums; 2. Serving the two Dowager Consorts Yi and Rong. Both Dowager Consorts are over sixty years old and need someone to serve them, so I cannot leave their side for even a moment. Yesterday's newspaper reported that I would be summoned by telegram to Shenyang to organize a guard army. I do not wish to engage in clever sophistry. I only ask patriotic people from all walks of life to go to the Peiping Telegraph Office to investigate in detail whether there have been any telegrams addressed to me from various parties recently. This is factual proof, requiring no explanation; the truth will naturally be clear. As for Yin Chang, he is nearing the end of his life, senile and incapable of doing anything. This time, Puyi was coerced to the Northeast by the Japanese, who are completely using him as a puppet. Even a mediocre person would know this. However, he has been bewitched by Zheng Xiaoxu and his son and Luo Zhenyu, and coerced by the power of the Japanese, losing his free will. Puyi is more intelligent than people like us; his plans would definitely not lead to this. What a pity that Gao Youtang, the representative from Nanjing, arrived in the north too late and was also deceived by the Zheng family, leading to this great mistake. His actions in Dalian this time are extremely unfree. Except for the faction of Zheng and those colluding with the Japanese, even his confidants have been driven away. For example, Hu Siyuan, a senior scholar with both integrity and learning, used to be consulted by Puyi on matters large and small. For more than ten years, they were inseparable, as close as his own hands. However, this time, he was deceived by the Zheng family regarding the trip to the Northeast. He was not consulted beforehand, and after the fact, he went to Dalian, only to meet Puyi once under the surveillance of the Japanese. After that, he was not allowed to see Puyi again, causing Hu to pound his chest and sigh as he returned to Tianjin. Empress Rong went to Dalian after him, and only after many twists and turns did the couple reunite. This so-called restoration in the Northeast does not include any Manchus or aristocratic elders. Based on this, it is truly not his own will."</p>

<p>Robbery Case Reported to the Bureau, Complicated Inside Story Hu Xianchu, a partner in the Senshengqiao cottonseed oil cake shop outside the north gate, went to Shanghai the day before yesterday to collect 1,950 yuan in oil payments from the Yuanda Oil Shop. He took the night express train back to Wuxi, and after getting off the train, he took a streetcar back to the shop to report his return. Unexpectedly, as soon as Hu entered the shop, he suddenly became flustered, his face pale. He told Manager Wang Shufan that after collecting the payment in Shanghai and returning to Wuxi, he took a streetcar to return to the shop to hand in the payment. Unexpectedly, when passing the Jiyu School along the Dahe Pond, he was suddenly met by three bandits who robbed him of the entire payment, as well as three velvet hats, a pair of shoes, and a cat fur robe.

The town has more than 30 stores, and many residents are wealthy. Unexpectedly, at 7:30 PM on the 17th, six or seven bandit boats suddenly arrived with about 50 bandits. Holding quick-firing guns and wooden-cased guns, and speaking mostly in Henan accent, they swarmed ashore. Other bandits guarded the entrance to the town. The bandits fired more than ten shots and then proceeded to search each store in turn. After an hour, they fired shots and boarded their original boats to leave. It is now known that more than 20 stores were looted, including Hongtai General Merchandise Store, Chen Risheng Tobacco Store, Zhunfeng Grain Store, Fan Futai Beijing Goods Store, and Chen Xiongji Grocery Store, with losses exceeding one thousand yuan in silver dollars.

<p>Zhenning Fishing Boat Confirmed to Have Sunk off Maou Zui The Zhenning fishing boat of the Zhengsheng Fishing Boat Bureau on the north bank of Yongbu River sailed out of Yong to fish on the 19th of last month, but has not been seen since. It has been rumored that the boat sank long ago. The bureau was deeply worried about the boat's long absence and sent someone to investigate the day before yesterday. It is now known that the investigators returned to Yong yesterday. The boat did sink off the coast of Mao Zui at about 11 AM on the 19th of last month due to a strong storm. No one witnessed it.

<p>Sixian Case Urgently Impacts Hefei's Defense Since the red bandits on the west bank of the Liu'an Pihe River were repeatedly attacked by Commander Yue's troops, their strength has been greatly damaged, and they have not dared to invade eastward for several months. Unexpectedly, this time, the red bandits in eastern Hubei were severely attacked by the Hubei provincial army and fled east to Yinghuo, causing the red bandits in the western part of Liu'an to suddenly grow in strength. On the 16th, they shelled Liu City from the west bank of the Pihe River and attacked from the Sujiabu area upstream. Commander Yue sent Wang Ducheng's brigade to engage them head-on. It is heard that they were repelled on the 17th. However, Commander Yue, believing that the number of bandits was very large, telegraphed the province for reinforcements. Commander-in-Chief Chen immediately ordered the 57th Division stationed in the Jiaohu area to rush to suppress them day and night. They will pass through Fei and go to Liu within a few days. County Magistrate Zhu Ting of Hefei, realizing that Heliu is in close proximity, and that absurd leaflets of the red bandits have recently appeared in the city, believes that the city's defense should be cautious. On the 17th, he convened a security meeting and decided to organize a temporary city defense office. He appointed 59 committee members from various public organizations and gentry, as well as military, political, party, and police agencies as ex-officio members. The city's security is being seriously searched by the 46th Division, together with the self-defense corps and police, to inspect the city gates, check household registrations, and inspect inns and hotels to prevent traitors from mixing in. On the afternoon of the 17th, County Magistrate Zhu sent the self-defense corps, public security team, and police team to temporarily inspect pedestrians at storytelling and entertainment venues such as the Wanshou Palace in the prefectural school, and sounded gongs throughout the city, requiring all households to place vats filled with clear water in front of their doors to prevent hidden dangers. He also telegraphed County Magistrate Wang Peishi of Shouxian, requesting that he implement joint defense and send troops to join forces at Wushan Temple in Yuji to suppress the bandits. Early in the morning of the 18th, the 46th Division sent 12 cars loaded with military supplies to Liu for replenishment. Hefei's internal and external defenses are now exceptionally solid.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Chen Jianxiao Takes Over as Director of Jiangxi Education Department <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>After the reorganization of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, former Director of Education Jiang Yi was hired by Chairman Xiong as a provincial government advisor, responsible for handling the affairs of the Department of Civil Affairs. Therefore, he repeatedly sent letters and telegrams urging the newly appointed Director of Education, Chen Jianxiao, to take office. Chen came to Jiangxi from Hankou to take the oath of office. In addition to retaining all the original staff, he also slightly changed the organization of the department. The original four sections of General Affairs, General, Specialized, and Social Affairs were changed to the first, second, third, and fourth sections. This was because the workload of the previous sections was uneven, and this change made things more balanced. Liu Fanguo, the former head of the General Affairs Section, who had been in charge for many years, was transferred to the position of secretary. Chen Yingkun, the former secretary during Chen Lijian's tenure as director, who is currently a secretary of the provincial government, was firmly requested to return to the department and continue to serve as secretary. There were not enough supervisors before, so two more were commissioned to conduct investigations of education in various counties and to supervise progress. The former Public Bulletin Editorial Office was transferred to the Jiangxi Compilation and Examination Office and became the editorial section, with its expenses being paid from the provincial education funds. Also, the address of the Education Department was originally borrowed from the former China-Thailand Bank's private housing. Now that it is being urgently requested back, the department moved to the former Shunzhi Guild Hall in front of the Dusi on the 13th and continues to work as usual.</p>

If it is certain that the game cannot be played today, it will be postponed. Otherwise, the game must be played.</p>

<p>The Group A and Group B of the Shanghai Basketball Association started last night. The first group of artillery teams stopped fighting, and Qingguang won without a fight. The second and third groups belonged to Group B, and the performances were mediocre and far behind the previous years. The fourth group was Group A, Yangshupu vs. Huadong. The two sides were evenly matched and the competition was fierce, but the formation was disorganized and lacked contact, so there was nothing brilliant to say. In the first half, Yangshupu won 20 to 15. The result was a 37 to 37 draw. In overtime, Yangshupu won the final victory with 45 to 39. There are two games in Group A tonight.

<p>Yangshupu vs. Huadong, after contact, Huadong Ling Xianyang scored first, and then Yangshupu's military appearance was quite strong, and the score increased repeatedly. It once led with 20 to 9. Huadong quickly caught up, and Liang Guoquan and Chen Qidong scored successively, ending the first half with 15 to 20. Huadong was 5 points behind. At the beginning of the second half, Lu Zhongen scored first, adding 2 points to Yangshupu. Unexpectedly, Huadong suddenly showed its edge, and the record increased repeatedly. Yangshupu's rear defense was empty and precarious, so it reorganized its formation and worked hard to struggle. The final result was a 37 to 37 draw. In overtime, Yangshupu carefully attacked, and Feng Nianhua, Qian Jingyong, and Lu Zhongen each scored, so they won 45 to 39.</p>

<h3 id="e110">One Lesson on Teaching a Son (Part 1) <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>In 1928, I bound a beautiful book with high-quality Xuan paper and placed it on my desk to prepare for students' questions and difficulties. A gold-painted label was pasted on the cover of this book, with the four characters "Life Problems" written by myself. Next to the book was a notice welcoming everyone to write out the questions in their hearts so that I could consider them in advance and then answer them. How poetic it is to write about things in your heart on a beautiful book! Needless to say, it is embarrassing to write chicken-foot characters on it. My purpose was achieved: before each student came to write a question, they had to practice some of the characters in the question many times before they were willing to write. Therefore, this book not only captured the steady stream of precious questions, but also unconsciously artisticized the characters used to write the questions. One day, I opened the book of life problems and found the following question:</p>
<p>"Can the master's teaching of his son be heard?"</p>
<p>The meaning of this question is extremely rich, giving a very profound stab. Since then, I have often asked myself: "How should this course of teaching a son be taught?" Now I publish the most recent lesson for the reference of people who have sons.</p>

<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>In recent years, many students from our country have returned to the country with doctoral titles to show off. There are even those who have obtained two or three doctorates. The evening before yesterday, Ding Jun invited me to a banquet at Nanyuan Restaurant. Among the guests were Zhu, Zhang, and Liu, old friends. Zhu was also an American doctor of economics. During the drinking session, Zhang Jun talked about the Amomum villosum Doctor. Everyone thought the words were very bizarre and asked him why. Zhang Jun recounted the details, saying: Several years ago, there was a person named Jia who was fond of visiting prostitutes. His father was a prominent official. He stayed in Germany for ten years and never went to school to listen to lectures. He was demoted again and again. He lingered in dance halls and brothels and his classmates despised him. But he was shameless. He once said loudly: It is easy to get a doctorate. Why be diligent? People ridiculed him for being able to talk nonsense. Someone became angry and said: You are short-sighted and do not know the heroes. I will get one within a month. If I don't get it, I swear I will not return to China. After saying that, he flicked his sleeves and left. When he returned to his residence, he deeply regretted the rash words he had said that day. He hated his classmates for their ridicule and criticism. He was unhappy and paced around the room, thinking silently. He did not know what to do. Suddenly he remembered that there was a quack doctor in Chinatown. He sighed with inspiration: Alas, this can be done. He hurriedly visited the doctor and asked to borrow the Compendium of Materia Medica. He picked up a recipe and translated it into German. He called it the effect of Amomum villosum. He wrote a thesis on the Amomum villosum in the Compendium, distinguishing its warm and pungent properties, indications, and effects. He submitted it to the research institute. The scholars in the institute read it and thought it was strange. They praised it and gave him a doctorate in Amomum villosum. His name became famous. I do not dare to agree with Zhang Jun's words. In recent years, those who have obtained a doctorate in pharmacy with garlic and a doctorate in science with gold juice are almost all made in the same way as a certain doctor. Even the Japanese newspaper published this month revealed that a Chinese named Li obtained a doctorate in science by submitting a thesis on preserved duck eggs, which is enough to prove that the words are true.</p>

<p>— A Member of the Youth Support the Military Corps</p>
<p>(10)(2) Arrives in Jinan</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, we bid farewell to the old year in Xuzhou. It was the last moment within Jiangsu province. At this time, my heart was filled with both sorrow and joy. Sorrow for the daily decline of the nation's power, joy for the prospect of killing enemies. Finally, I recalled my kind parents, my loving sister, my lively younger brother, and my loyal nanny. But, after indulging in such reverie for nearly half an hour, in the end, the detestable nature of the brutal invaders inflamed my passion. Thus, all illusory thoughts vanished, reaffirming my fearless will.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of New Year's Day, we departed from Xuzhou and arrived in Jinan the next morning. Representatives from the provincial government were at the station to greet us, but we did not disembark because the commander told us, "It is said that there are spies of the Japanese bandits here, plotting against us." Before long, the municipal government bestowed upon us steamed buns and thin porridge, and other food items at the station. At that time, each of our stomachs was rumbling like thunder. Receiving this nourishment, we were all immensely grateful.</p>
<p>The mournful cries of crows were carried by the wind into the carriages. The vast twilight gradually enveloped everything outside the window. Everything faded away, but I could see the lights illuminating the silver-clad roadside, incessantly exuding a biting cold. Many comrades were asleep, but I was still wandering alone. Suddenly, I heard a burst of loud noise. I couldn't help but jump off the platform, left the station, and ran straight into the city streets. I suddenly saw thousands of Japanese beasts rampaging wildly. Flesh torn by bullets flew everywhere. Anyone hit would fall, and any building hit would burst into flames. I was about to turn back to report to the commander when I suddenly heard cries for help from a side street. I followed the cries to the inner room of a shop. Alas, a female compatriot was lying there, her lower body naked, like a dying white dove frantically flapping its wings because it couldn't breathe, struggling with a ferocious bandit. Beside the bed, a young man lay on the ground, covered in blood. My anger flared up, and I shouted, "You beasts, cease your impudence!" Before I could finish speaking, I was grabbed from behind, and both my hands were bound with rope. I turned my head to look inside and recognized another soldier beast. He grabbed me and dragged me out the door, and I vaguely arrived at a place. At the door, a sign seemed to read "Jinan..." This beast soldier led me inside and tied me to a pillar. I saw layers upon layers of beastly shadows surrounding a compatriot tied to another pillar, shouting incomprehensibly for a while. Finally, one by one, they each punched that compatriot and left. After a while, several burly brutes with faces full of fat came in. They saw that the compatriot had black eyes and swollen ears, a weak body, and a faint breath, but they grinned sinisterly. One of them drew a bayonet from his waist. In a flash, blood gushed forth, and the compatriot's nose was sliced off. I was furious and strained against my bonds, but then I heard someone ask, "What's going on? What's going on?" I turned my gaze towards the four walls and realized that I was in a carriage. Only then did I understand that the humiliation of the May 3rd Massacre was like this...</p>

<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>An Autobiography by Movie Star Hu Die</p>
<p>For the past few years, my satisfaction has depended on the praise of many dear audience members, and my position has also made good progress; however, I myself have only ever obtained satisfaction once. My photos being plastered all over newspapers is not what satisfies me; my name, larger than a bowl, in advertisements is not what satisfies me; all the mementos that reward me and praise me are not what satisfies me. So, what exactly satisfies me? And why have I only been satisfied once? When I talk about it, I don’t know who to thank. It turns out that in the early summer of the twentieth year of the Republic [1931], the Star Film Company suddenly received many letters from strangers. All of these letters were addressed to Mr. Zhang Shichuan and Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu; the addresses of the senders, some were from Shanghai, some from the Northeast, some from Beiping, some from Southeast Asia; although the sentences in the letters were different, they had the same meaning. Until the end of July, within twenty or thirty days, a total of more than one hundred and seventy letters were received, all saying, "Why doesn't your company film [Tixiao Yinyuan] Fate in Tears and Laughter?... With Hu Die playing He Lina and Fengxi..." Ah! How surprising and ashamed it makes one feel! At least, I had more than one hundred and seventy sympathizers. This was the only time since I appeared on the screen that I have felt genuinely satisfied.</p>
<p>Afterwards, after the plan to shoot Fate in Tears and Laughter was confirmed, we began preparations to start work. I also took the time to read through Fate in Tears and Laughter. Although I felt that Fengxi, in the book of that era, was not a person I could portray, the fact was that I had to work hard to take on this heavy task. I remember that at that time, "Sing-song Girl Red Peony," in which I starred, was being shown at the New Light Grand Theatre and was sold out for seven days, so naturally I was very happy; many people said that it was my most satisfactory work, and even many people said that I should change my previous style and become a performer of tears like Pearly Lin Gan-xu. However, for the sake of Fate in Tears and Laughter, I didn't quite believe this opinion. I seemed to be somewhat overconfident; I might even be overconfident. I will wait until Fate in Tears and Laughter is successful, and let the dear audience give me an honest critique!</p>

<p>— Bu Jiasheng</p>
<p>I have often said that the more prosperous the surface of Shanghai becomes, the darker its underside becomes. Their progress proceeds at the same speed. Swindling is one aspect of the dark side of Shanghai. The techniques employed are constantly evolving, making it impossible for people to guard against them. Therefore, I will describe a recent event to inform the readers. There is a Huada Pharmacy on Foch Road, which mainly deals in "Lion Brand" beef and chicken broth products from the German Malta Pharmaceutical Factory. In recent years, sales have continued to grow, extending to Southeast Asia. Some people come to Shanghai with cash to purchase wholesale. On the morning of the fourth day, someone claiming to be Hu Fuqing, a representative from the Zhuyu Long Firm in Lanxi, came to the pharmacy to purchase sixty cases of beef broth and one case of chicken broth, with a total value of over nine hundred yuan. Hu presented a note for one thousand taels issued by Henglong and payable at the Ankang Money Exchange in Shanghai on the eighth day. The pharmacy then agreed with Hu that they would cash the note on the eighth day and pick up the goods on the tenth day. One thousand taels converted to over one thousand three hundred yuan. After deducting the price of the goods, there was still a surplus of more than four hundred yuan. The pharmacy issued a check from the Jiangsu Bank for the remaining amount, dated the twelfth, believing that since there was no cash payment, there was no need to worry. Moreover, the pharmacy has always had a 0.99 commission for wholesale, as a reward for the intermediary. The goods purchased by Hu were actually worth over nine hundred yuan, and a commission of nine yuan and some cents should be given. Since it was already paid at that time, this commission should be paid. The pharmacy did not want to give the commission in cash, since Hu did not purchase with cash, preferring to lose a few more cents. They also issued a check for ten yuan dated the twelfth. With such caution, the swindlers would have no way to use their tricks. Unexpectedly, after Hu took the check, he actually changed the date from the twelfth to the fourth and went to the Jiangsu Bank to cash it. The Jiangsu Bank did not notice and actually paid out over four hundred yuan. When it was discovered, the so-called Hu Fuqing had disappeared without a trace. The pharmacy tentatively took the note to Ankang to cash it, but they said that the original note had not arrived. It was not until the eleventh day that they despondently stopped going to cash it.</p>

<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Two Talents Arrive Together, Scattering the Banquet; Yin and Xing Avoid Each Other, Who Left the Jewel Box?</p>
<p>Here was Liang Xiaoyun, as beautiful as a flower, in my own room, drinking and chatting intimately. If she were to run over and catch us in the act, women's minds are narrow and their jealousy is strong. It would inevitably make these two radiant rivals feel like they had splinters in their eyes at the same time, causing great unhappiness. And the one caught in the middle, facing difficulties on both sides, would only be me. Although Liang Xiaoyun might not say anything, Li Wenxia has a tongue like a sharp sword and a mouth like a torrent, never willing to easily forgive others. Moreover, if she were to catch her with some faults, she would certainly launch a major campaign of accusation afterward, bringing out some great principles of ancient sages and worthies, speaking eloquently and reproaching me for inviting idlers and strangers into the house to drink and make merry behind her back when I had suffered such a great tragedy, putting my parents' grievances and the mourning in my funeral attire completely out of my mind, forgetting them completely. She would ask where my heart was and where my sense of righteousness lay. At that time, she would be righteous and have plenty to say, but how would I face her and what words would I use to answer? Bad, bad, bad. I can't just wait for her to come and catch my mistake and cause so much trouble. While there is still time, I should quickly run back to the room and make an excuse to get Liang Xiaoyun to leave first, so that the two of them will forever be a pair of Yin and Xing avoiding each other, in order to avoid some unnecessary arguments and maintain world peace. Thinking that time was of the essence, I immediately ran back to the room in a panic. Seeing Liang Xiaoyun sitting upright on the edge of the seat, waiting for me, I was about to ask her to leave as soon as I opened my mouth, but I don't know why I was a little cowardly at the last minute. For a moment, I hesitated and couldn't say anything, and instead, my face turned purple and I gasped for breath, and I still obediently sat down with her. Liang Xiaoyun had been sitting here alone for a long time, and she was already feeling lonely and anxious. She was secretly wondering which important friend was calling, causing him to rush around and leave her alone in the cold, without even showing a little courtesy. When he ran back, she took a closer look at him and found that he was distracted and his face was haggard, even more agitated than before. She couldn't help but be very surprised and couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong with you? I just heard someone call and you rushed off like that. When you came back, your face looked even worse. Who was this call from? What did they say? Could it be that there is some new information from your family?" An Yutian was worried about how to lie, but her words happened to open up a path for him. He answered her, "That's right. Another person has come from my hometown. They will be coming here in a while. However, this person is a senior elder. If you are here, it might not be convenient to meet them. So I want to discuss with you and ask you to leave first. Tomorrow I will definitely go to your place and have a long chat."</p>

<h3 id="e117">Gold Standard Money Plummets Sharply <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>A Disastrous Drop of 15 Taels and 8 Mace</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold standard money market experienced even more severe declines, with deteriorating conditions. There was only limited recovery, and the atmosphere was filled with panic and fear. Although there was no specific news from abroad, it was actually caused by large investors selling off in droves. Throughout the day, the high and low points differed by over 19 taels, resulting in an overall sharp drop of about 16 taels. The market opened with a slight decline, and the silver market rose slightly. Afterwards, Yufeng Yong and other firms sold off, and foreign exchange also appeared to be loose and abundant. Various firms made some advances, leading to this sharp downturn and a plunge of more than ten taels. The price suddenly broke through 670 taels. Later, it was heard that cash was being transported from India to England, which further fueled the selling pressure, breaking through 70 taels again. Afterwards, buyers seemed diligent, and exchange rates were still peaceful. However, the situation was very chaotic and difficult to manage. Although there was no trading of swaps, the momentum of many parties was greatly reduced, so the shorts advanced instead, by about one tael or more, etc.</p>
<p>The market opened with a decline. The market opened slightly lower by 1 tael and 8 mace, at 687 taels. Large silver rebounded by 3/16, and the silver price increased by 1/8. There were fluctuations of more than 1 tael afterwards, from 6.5 to 8 taels. The cashiers of various firms differed in their actions, but Tong Taichang and hedging firms sold off more, so the price plummeted by 4 or 5 taels. The initial closing price of US dollars for March and April was 32.6875 yuan. Later, the price for this month's trading was 812.5, so the gold price fell to 83.2 taels. Shunli, Wanxing, and small investors advanced slightly, rebounding by more than 1 tael. The announcement of the British gold price remained unchanged, at 85.34 taels. The internal market was stable. Anda and Mitsui traded British gold for next month at 6875, and also issued US dollars from 6875 to 625. Qian Changxiang and Yifeng and others bought a lot, causing the price to jump by 3 taels, to 88.2 taels at 9:30. After entering, US dollars for March were sold by Mitsui and HSBC, with a price of 625. Hengyu, Hengxing, Daxingyong, Yuhe, Yuanheng Hong Kangyong, and Meifengyong all sold, causing a drop of 7 to 8 taels, to 80.05 taels at 10:10. At this time, Hengxing, Qian Changxiang, Yuan Maoyong, and Tong Taichang bought, and various firms raised the British gold price to 625, so the gold price rebounded by more than 4 taels, to 84.8 taels at 10:50.</p>
<p>The 70-tael mark was breached. However, the major firm Yufeng Yong sold a lot through Yifeng Yong and Hengyu. Chunyuanyong, Daxingyong, Dadecheng, Hengxingyuan, Wanxing, Shunli, and Fuyu all sold off. The US dollar could be closed at 75. Afterwards, various firms only revised their positions, and hedging became even more distant, reaching about 50 taels. Selling to banks was at 33 yuan, and the British gold price for the near term was 875, causing the market sentiment to collapse like a mountain and the sea. The price plummeted by more than 10 taels, finally reaching 69 taels at 11:30. From 11:00 to this time, there were only 1-2 tael of market adjustments. Afterwards, hedging firms advanced, and small and short investors slightly covered their positions, so the price rose by 5-6 taels, to 75 taels at 11:50. The price then fell by 2 taels again, with Hengyu and others selling off. At the noon close, the price was 74 taels, and there were trades at 73-4 taels. The announced price was still 750 taels, with premiums of 64-5 taels to 62-3 taels, and a maximum of 80 taels. The noon close was 75-6 taels, because the market price was erratic.</p>
<p>The situation in the afternoon market was chaotic. The afternoon market opened weakly at 71.5 taels, due to small goods also opening small. The price then increased to 74.8 taels, and small investors bought in. Huabi then absorbed British gold for next month at 825, and Shanghai absorbed US dollars for April at 33 yuan. Afterwards, Huabi released 875, and firms then dumped 33 yuan. It was suddenly heard that cash was being exported from India, and people's hearts suddenly turned uneasy. Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, and Dadecheng all sold off in large quantities, and the market situation fell into deterioration again, triggering a drop of 5-6 taels, reaching 69 taels again after 2:30. In a blink of an eye, Mitsui absorbed US dollars for April at 9375, and British gold was released by Zhejiang at 6875. HSBC released US dollars for February at 875. The buyers inside the market seemed numerous, and Yuan Maoyong, Yifeng, Hong Yong, and Hengxing all advanced, immediately raising the price by 5-6 taels, reaching 75.3 taels at 3:30. Suddenly, Dadecheng, Qian Changxiang, and Tong Taichang sold off, and HSBC released British gold for April at 75, and also released US dollars for next month at 875, reaching 70.5 taels at 3:50. In a moment, the price was raised to 73.2 taels again. At 4:00, Shanghai absorbed US dollars for March at 6875. Then, Huabi was willing to release 6875. Sellers seemed numerous on the surface, and the price fell back to 71-2 taels. In a short while, the price rebounded by more than 1 tael, to 73 taels, but the exchange rate market was not good. US dollars could be bought at 875, but British gold was only at 6875. At 4:20, the price fell to 70.08 taels. At this time, Yifeng and Tong Taichang advanced again, and the price rose by 4.2 taels in a flash. By the 4:30 close, the price was 73 taels, a rebound from the sharp drop of 15.8 taels the previous day. It was then traded at around 74 taels again. The highest price during the day was 88.2 taels, and the lowest price was 69 taels, a difference of 19.2 taels, which can be said to be huge. The morning market price of goods was 87.7 taels, the noon close was 73.5, the afternoon was 71 taels, and the closing price was 73.8 taels. The announced price was estimated to be around 80 taels, with a registration price of 74 taels, a supplementary water price of 74 taels, and an afternoon price of 73 taels. No one inquired about the red bills, so the price was also small, increasing by only 5 qian.</p>
<p>Transactions were excessive in supply. Although there were many transactions on the table, most of them were selling positions. Statistics show that Zhifengyong, Qian Changxiang, Bingxing, Yuan Maoyong, Yifeng, and Yuhe all advanced. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Daxingyong, Yifengyong, Chunyuanyong, Hengxingyuan, Shunli, Wanxing, Taifengcheng, Hong Kangyong, Dakang, Futaiheng, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and Chengfengyong all issued. Yufeng Yong sold a lot. It is estimated that the issued notes were bought and sold by Hengxing, Tong Taichang, and Yuan Tai, and others. In the afternoon, Yuan Maoyong, Shunli, Wanxing, Hong Gengyong, Hengxing, and Yifeng all advanced. Tong Taichang, Yuan Tai, Yuanchun, Hengchangyong, and Futaiheng had frequent receipts and payments. Zhifengyong and Qian Changxiang first issued and then advanced. Dadecheng, Yifengyong, and Yuhe and Dingchang all issued. The Dalian gang issued a total of 700 to 800 notes and advanced 500 to 600 notes. The Guang gang, such as Yifeng, advanced a total of more than 1,600 notes in the morning and afternoon. Hengxing both issued and entered, with an estimated total of 600 to 700 notes. Speculator Mr. Wu and others issued and then advanced, but the amount was not large, etc.</p>

<p>Hedging Becomes More Distant... A Difference of 50 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets both reported slight increases, and the market was firm. However, the exchange rates were the opposite of the previous day. The British rate against the US dollar fell by 0.625, to 3.86 yuan, and the US rate against the British dollar rebounded by a large fraction, to 3.45875 yuan.

However, it was not as severe as the sharp drop in the gold market, where the gold standard money price broke through 670 taels. This was actually due to large investors selling off in large quantities, so the hedging difference was even greater. In the morning market, the difference was 43-4 taels to 50 taels, and in the afternoon market, it was also 50 taels. The gold gang, such as Fuchang, hedged back, and sold notes.

<h3 id="e119">Overseas Silver Prices Rebound <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram from London yesterday, large silver rebounded by 0.1875, with the near-term price being 19 pence 125 and the far-term price being 19 pence 375. The increase was mainly due to slight purchases by China, and the market was flat. After the close, the market was firm in the near term and flat in the far term due to US support. A telegram from New York stated that the US silver price also increased by 0.125, with the spot price being 29.625 cents. The British rate against the US dollar fell by 0.625, to 3.46 yuan, and the US rate against the British dollar increased by 0.5 fen, to 3.45875 yuan.

<h3 id="e120">Foreign Interest Rates Exceeded 2% <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Due to Strong Buying Interest</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rates Also High at 6%</p>
<p>Market Overview. Yesterday's financial market, from a superficial observation, did not have any major news. However, the sudden increase in foreign interest rates, which exceeded 7 qian and 2 fen yesterday afternoon, was noteworthy in the market. Although the current increase in interest rates was unexpected, it was a precedent for the year-end accounting period. In previous years, there were too many repayments at this time, so prices had to fall.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices. The buying interest in "foreign interest" was too strong in the morning, and the supply side became hesitant, so the interest rate rose, increasing by 0.5% compared to the high price of the previous afternoon, to 7 qian, 1.0825 fen. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon market, the early market was unable to buy enough, so prices had to be raised to purchase, resulting in a surge of more than 2%, exceeding 2%, to 7 qian, 2.05%. As a result, the price increased by a total of 3.025% compared to the early market of the previous day. The "silver interest" rate was 1.4% in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 6% compared to the previous day. Banks listed rates at 6% plus 4-5%.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market. The price of Jiangnan small silver was slightly lower due to scarce transactions. The price was 6 qian and 5.08% in both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of 0.02% compared to the previous morning. Transactions were 4,500 yuan in the morning market and 2,000 yuan in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver price was 6 qian and 6.01% in the morning market and 6 qian and 6.025% in the afternoon market, a slight change of 0.0225% compared to the previous day. Transactions were 125,000 yuan in the morning market and 50,000 yuan in the afternoon market. The copper coin price increased slightly by 500 wen, to 368.5 x 1,000 wen. Transactions were 28,089 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Coin Inflow and Outflow. Yesterday, banks collected and disbursed funds, with slightly more settlements. Chinese merchants collected and disbursed 1.89 million in notes, foreign merchants collected and disbursed over 1.7 million in notes, various goods, exchange tax, and miscellaneous funds collected and disbursed over 7 million, settlement funds collected and disbursed over 3 million, special funds over 2 million, warehouse inflow of 1.2 million, money houses and silver companies collected and disbursed over 48 million in single notes, payment funds over 4.1 million, various exchange funds collected and disbursed over 700,000, and cash disbursements over 1 million. "Foreign funds" exchange and payment notes were made at 725,000 in the morning market and 795,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 55,000 in the morning market and 35,000 in the afternoon market. Off-market banknotes were 100,500 in the morning market and 75,000 in the afternoon market. Bank transactions were 700,000 in the morning market and 600,000 in the afternoon market. The inflow and outflow of foreign accounts of various banks were over 1.5 million, and banknote inflow and outflow were over 1.5 million. Money houses and foreign public purchases and disbursements were over 4.5 million. Foreign payment funds collected and disbursed were over 1.7 million. Foreign fund lending was over 1.3 million. Small money house transactions were 400,000 to 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Discussion of Interest Rates During the Year-End Accounting Period <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>As a rule, every year-end accounting period, in order to facilitate the closing of accounts, there is a custom of deciding on the interest rate settlement in advance. Yesterday, the Money Trade Association decided that the interest rate for savings from January 1st to January 20th would be calculated at 3.95%, and the interest rate for savings from January 21st to January 31st would be calculated at 2.95%. Interest on arrears would still be added at the sitting rate of 4.5%.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Securities and Bond Prices Rise First, Then Fall <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The result is a slight decrease of about one dollar.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 22nd), the state of the Chinese securities and bond market was such that there were still many types of spot trading being done. However, there were only sporadic transactions. The futures market was relatively quiet in the morning, becoming slightly more active later, but the market atmosphere remained calm throughout. In the early morning trading, there were a few buyers, and prices mostly rebounded firmly. For example, the "Disbandment Bonds" and "1929 Customs Bonds" each rose by about half a dollar. However, they then suffered a setback, with selling being particularly strong and buying gradually becoming lukewarm. Market sentiment was somewhat weak, and supply exceeded demand, causing prices to gradually fall and become weak. There were no major fluctuations in the special issues. As a result, compared to the previous day, only the "Disbandment Bonds" spot and February futures each increased by 30 cents, the "1929 Customs Bonds" spot rose by $1.40, and the "1931 Customs Bonds" spot increased by 50 cents. The others all decreased by 50-60 cents to several dollars. Furthermore, the February "Customs Bonds" had been inactive for a long time. When trading opened yesterday, it immediately fell by $4.00 and was halted. Looking at the situation of the bond market, it seems unlikely that there will be another huge drop in the short term. However, it is also difficult to expect an immediate turnaround, as although our domestic situation has improved slightly, the diplomatic situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the future is difficult to be optimistic about. The total spot trading volume for the day was $24,000, and the futures trading volume was approximately $3.4 million in the morning and afternoon sessions respectively, totaling $6,825,000. Among them, the "1929 Customs Bonds," "1931 Customs Bonds," "Consolidated Salt Tax," etc., each accounted for approximately $900,000.</p>

<p>The yarn market is flat and tired, with a softening trend. Due to the unstable current situation, financial conditions are difficult to ease, and morale is low. Retail investors tend to sell, resulting in a dispersed situation. However, the bullish parties for this month, Rongxing and Yichang, are holding tight, and actual demand has been relatively good recently.</p>
<p>Weak Buying Interest in Human Bids: At the Exchange, the pre-market opening for human bids saw flat American cotton prices, and buying interest in the market softened. Prices for all months fell by 4-8 cents. The afternoon session was flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 19,000 bales. It was found that Taixing sold 2,050 bales, Minghua 800 bales, and Xincheng 1,400 bales. Buyers included Gongtai 1,800 bales, Yichang 1,450 bales, Ruidai 1,050 bales, and Changfeng 650 bales.

<p>The cotton market is stable, and the situation is still firm. The price of Indian cotton is now higher than that of domestic cotton, so some manufacturers are reversing their decisions on Indian cotton and buying domestic cotton instead to meet their needs. Therefore, the trend for this month is becoming increasingly firm. Although gold prices are weak, market sentiment has not been affected. More people are accepting deliveries, and most are still looking at a price of 33 taels. The situation of American cotton is still weak, but it is currently difficult to fall. We are waiting for changes in Indian cotton, and there may be a possibility of another decline.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Near-Term Slightly Firm: At the Exchange, the pre-market opening for Hankou Standard saw flat American cotton prices. Today's prices were slightly affected, and buying interest in the market was sluggish. Prices for all months fell by 1-2 cents. In the afternoon, prices for all months rebounded by 0.5 cents, and the near-term was slightly firmer. The total transaction volume for the day was 64,500 dan. It was found that Hengyi sold 2,300 dan, Yichang 1,200 dan, Mingde 1,200 dan, Changji 1,800 dan, and Changhe 1,600 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the source of goods from various guilds in Shanghai South gradually recovered, reaching about 50 firms. However, port storage was still thin. Due to the warm weather, stores in urban and rural areas, and the tired Zha Bei market, morale was flat. The price of Thick Xin Geng rice suddenly fell. Discussing market conditions, the sky was covered with dark clouds in the morning, and there was fear of rain, which could change the situation. There was a slight inventory of Thin Early Rice, and although transactions were active on this street, only 10-20 cents were lost. Ocean Reed Tip cargo was rarely sold and presented a firm trend. Sales of Ocean Rice were sluggish, and the trend returned to weakness. Futures of Ocean rice were sold off, and the image was also tired.</p>
<p>The source of goods from Xin Zha was over 4,000 ships. Sales of Changxi White Geng rice were sluggish, down by 1 cent. Kunshan Jiang rice also tended to go downstream. Sales in the entire city were weak. Qingjiao Biao Lian and other thin commodities fell by 10-20 cents, mainly due to weak buying interest. Telegrams from production areas reported fatigue, and Ocean Tip and Metamorphosis Yuan goods were slightly affected on this street. The situation continued to decline.</p>

<p>The daily Ocean Rice market situation still had no customers from other regions inquiring. There was still some demand on this street, and the overall market trend remained flat. However, the arrival of Saigon rice was less, and the appetite on this street was very strong. The market price alone rose by nearly 10 cents. It was said that 300 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were opened, with prices ranging from $11.75 to $11.70. 500 bags of Xiao Jiao were opened, with prices ranging from $10.05 to $9.80. There were 60 tons of returned cargo in futures. New transactions opened for 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice for February, with a price of 5 taels and 2 qian. Another 500 tons for April, with a price of 5 taels and 3 qian, were all sold by Anli.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Flour Market Changes from Stable to Tired <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a stable image for each month after the opening in the morning. Opening prices were similar to the previous day, with very little difference. Until the opening in the afternoon, it was still stable at first. Then, the factories continued to order two ships of Australian wheat, and successively issued documents for the long term. Although the number was not huge, morale was finally affected. According to this situation, the disposals by the factories were all real goods, which was naturally different from general floating speculation. Therefore, the future outcome is not yet time to be optimistic. As a result, this month was down 7.5 li compared to the previous day, February was down 1 cent, March was down 7.5 li, April was down 1.5 cents, May was down 1.75 cents, and June was down 0.25 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Wheat Market Temporarily Stabilizes <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market generally presented a stable image. Although the quoted price of Ocean Wheat slightly decreased by about 10-20 cents, outsiders had the intention of purchasing. There were very few sellers. The factories were said to have the intention of purchasing for this month, so the market atmosphere was relatively stable. Transactions for long-term months were still few. Because this month was stabilizing, it also saw a carryover. However, it was reported that another two ships of wheat were transacted, with a price of 3 taels and 7 qian and 1 fen. If orders continue to be placed, the future situation will likely remain in a state of flux. As a result, this month was up 4 fen compared to the previous day, February was up 2 fen, March was up 1 fen, April remained unchanged, May was up 1 fen, and June was up 2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Sugar Market: Wufu White Ice Uniquely Maintains a Strong Position <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Since last year, the production of Wufu White Ice has been improving day by day. Because of its clear color and fewer ice chips and debris, it is quite popular among all guilds. Therefore, other brands of Jian Bing are all affected by the ice from this factory, and the source of goods has decreased. However, Wufu Ice alone can maintain its original position without much impact. It was found that the sales volume for 1931 reached nearly 6,000 boxes, of which the sub-brand only accounted for about 20%. The highest price for the Wufu brand was 9 taels and 4 qian per block, and the lowest price was the current market price of 8 taels and 7 qian. The highest price for its sub-brand was 8 taels and 5 qian, and the lowest price was 8 taels. Furthermore, the current Shanghai inventory of Wufu Ice is only a few hundred boxes, the sub-brand Yuchun has about 200 boxes, and other miscellaneous brands have a total of only about 1,000 boxes. Therefore, Wufu Ice still maintains a strong position.</p>

Mian He White was 11 taels and 7 qian, Mo Xi Sha White was 9 taels and 8 qian, and No. 8 He Chi was 8 taels and 3 qian to 3 qian and 5 fen. The market situation was stable.

Xin Zhi Chi had already arrived, with a few hundred bags opened yesterday, with a price of 10 taels and 8-9 qian. The market situation was quite stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market remained sluggish. The opening price of silk in New York and Lyon was surprisingly low, with a difference of over 100 taels (per 100 catties) compared to domestic silk from white filatures. All silk merchants focused on Japanese silk. Telegrams from Shanghai to transfer silk sales were unlikely to turn around. Only Lianna and others brought in 14 packages of factory silk, and Xiangji and others brought in 17 packages of yellow filature silk. Prices remained flat and tired.</p>

The top price opened at 155 taels, a sharp increase of 10-20 taels compared to the previous few days. General tea merchants, in view of the market's low inventory, had a firm attitude.

<h3 id="e137">Municipal Government Lodges Protest Against Japanese Riot Case <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Secretary-General Yu Announces the Course of Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>Regarding the Incident of Japanese Rioters Burning Down the Sanyou Industrial Company Factory</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Government filed a serious written protest with the Japanese Consulate, and Secretary-General Yu also made an important statement regarding this case. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Secretary-General Yu's Statement: Yesterday, reporters visited Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and inquired about the recent Sino-Japanese negotiations in the city. He replied as follows: On the 18th of this month, at around 5 o'clock, the Municipal Government received a report that five Japanese monks were beaten by rioters in Yinxiang Township. It immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate the truth as soon as possible. According to a report from the Public Security Bureau to the Municipal Government, five Japanese monks, including Tenzaki Keisho, Mizukami Hideyu, and Buddhist followers Goto Yoshihei, Kurodani Asatsujiro, and Fujimura Kuniyoshi, held a winter practice religious ceremony on the 10th. While passing behind the Sanyou Towel Factory on Mayushan Road, they were attacked by rioters. Tenzaki, Mizukami, and Goto were slower to escape and were seriously injured, lying on the roadside. They were later sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital on Ningguo Road in the Public Concession for treatment by the Fifth District Fourth Office. The remaining Kurodani and Fujimura suffered lighter injuries and reported to the Yangshupu Police Station themselves. They were sent to the hospital by the police car. As for the rioters, they could not be arrested on the spot because the area was remote and there were no posts. The Municipal Government immediately ordered the bureau to arrest the perpetrators within a time limit and bring them to justice. On the morning of the 19th, Japanese Consul-General Murai Kuramatsu visited the Mayor. The Mayor had not yet returned to Shanghai, so he was received by me. The Japanese Consul immediately made an oral protest regarding the case. I informed him that the details of the case were being investigated, but since it had been reported that Japanese people were injured by Chinese people on Chinese territory, it was unfortunate and should be regretted. That afternoon, I visited the Japanese Consul and requested that he restrain the overseas Chinese and wait quietly for a resolution. Unexpectedly, the next day (the 20th), I received a report that the Japanese had set fire to the Sanyou Towel Factory of a Chinese merchant in the early morning and killed a Chinese policeman on duty in the Public Concession and injured two Chinese policemen. I believed that this kind of violent and illegal act by the Japanese was inexcusable and immediately visited the Japanese Consul that day to make an oral protest. The Japanese Consul expressed regret and stated that he would be responsible for arresting the perpetrators and handling the matter seriously. The day before yesterday (the 21st) morning, when the Japanese Consul visited the Mayor at the Municipal Government, he personally expressed his regret to the Mayor and presented a written protest regarding the case of the injured Japanese monks, making four requests: (1) The Mayor must express his apology to the Consul-General; (2) The search, arrest, and punishment of the perpetrators should be carried out quickly and effectively; (3) Medical expenses and compensation should be given to the five victims; (4) Illegal and outrageous actions such as anti-Japanese and insulting Japan should be strictly prohibited, and the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee and various anti-Japanese groups should be dissolved immediately. Mayor Wu immediately gave an oral reply, stating that regarding the third item, Chinese law had explicit provisions for the punishment of injury crimes, and the perpetrators would be arrested and dealt with according to law. As for items one and three, they could also be considered. However, the fourth item concerned the people's movement, and if it was within the scope of the law, he had no right to prohibit it. If there were illegal actions, they would be punished according to law. Mayor Wu had gone to Beijing that evening to ask for instructions. As for the case of the Japanese setting fire to the Sanyou Towel Factory of a Chinese merchant and killing and injuring Chinese policemen, the Municipal Government issued a written protest to the Japanese Consul yesterday. This is the course of the Municipal Government's handling of the recent Sino-Japanese negotiations in the city. The Municipal Government's handling of all cases, whether they are domestic or foreign, will be handled fairly and according to law. For example, regarding the case of obstructing the Japanese monks, the Japanese monks were innocently beaten, and the perpetrators will be strictly arrested and brought to justice. As for the actions of the Japanese forming a team to burn Chinese factories and kill and injure Chinese policemen on duty, serious negotiations should be carried out to achieve the desired goals. At the same time, the local area should be strictly guarded to ensure the safety of the urban area.</p>
<p>Serious Protest by the Municipal Government: At 3:00 PM yesterday, the Municipal Government specifically filed a serious protest with the Japanese Consulate regarding the arson case at the Sanyou Factory. The text reads, "Dear Sir, according to a report from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, at 2:20 AM on the 20th of this month, dozens of young Japanese people sneaked outside the Sanyou Cotton Weaving Factory on Mayushan Road in Yinxiang Port in this city and set fire to four places. At that time, the workers were asleep due to the late hour and did not notice. Later, the factory staff carefully investigated and according to nearby villagers, the Japanese used fire wine, gasoline, sulfur, and other substances to guide the arson. At that time, there were three Chinese policemen on duty at the nearby police booth. Upon hearing the alarm, they immediately called the fire brigade for help. The Japanese surrounded the booth and used knives to injure Chinese policeman No. 3029. Chinese policeman No. 1116 was stabbed and fell to the ground. The telephone was cut and thrown into the nearby river. Another Chinese policeman No. 765 was chased to Linqing Road by the Japanese and killed with sharp blades. The Japanese then fled without a trace. The factory was burned and suffered great losses." Based on this, it was found that the Japanese dared to form a team in the early morning to set fire to and destroy a domestic factory and kill Chinese policemen on duty. Not only is it not tolerated by the law, but at this time of many events, the impact is particularly serious. In addition to immediately sending personnel to file a protest, the following conditions are specifically proposed: (1) The Japanese Consul-General expresses his apology to the Mayor; (2) The arsonists and murderers are quickly arrested and severely punished; (3) Full compensation is paid to the victims, and the amount of compensation is negotiated separately; (4) A firm guarantee is made that similar incidents will not occur in the future. The Mayor sincerely hopes that your Consul will sincerely fulfill the above articles so that this case can be resolved quickly, disputes can be resolved, and friendly relations between the two countries can be maintained. A letter is sent accordingly, please investigate. To Murai Kuramatsu, Consul-General of Japan stationed in Shanghai, Mayor Wu Techeng.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Japanese Memorandum Says <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The City Government Denies Receipt</p>
<p>Japanese Residents' General Meeting Today</p>
<p>Chinese Authorities on Alert</p>
<p>Since the Japanese residents' riot occurred, the situation in this port has reached a critical point. The Japanese side insists that after the Japanese Consul-General Murai submitted a request to Mayor Wu, demanding the immediate dissolution of anti-Japanese groups, the Japanese Navy Commander Shiozawa also submitted an ultimatum to the city government the night before last, preparing to use force as a backing. It is further said that this final warning was also sent to the Public Works Department for reference. The Japanese newspapers have stated this with certainty, and the local English-language "North China Daily News" also recorded this matter. However, neither the city government nor the Public Works Department had received the memorandum as of last night. Last night, our newspaper reporter further inquired about the truth from the Japanese side. It was claimed that what the Japanese Navy Commander had submitted was not an ultimatum, but a statement containing the nature of a final warning. It was also said that the Japanese Navy and consulate authorities have a firm attitude. If Mayor Wu does not give a satisfactory reply to their demands, they will resolutely use force against certain organizations. The Japanese who died in the fight with the Chinese police in the International Settlement at Yinxiang Port are scheduled to be buried today, and the Japanese residents will then hold a general meeting. It is feared that incidents may occur. The Public Works Department stated that they would maintain the peace in the International Settlement, but will act as they see fit.</p>
<p>Foreign Press Reports: According to the "North China Daily News," on Thursday evening,</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Shiozawa, Commander of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, sent an ultimatum to the Mayor of Shanghai, demanding a satisfactory response to the Japanese Consul-General's protest against the anti-Japanese movement and the assault on Japanese residents, and demanding the dissolution of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and other anti-Japanese groups. If these demands are not met, the Japanese naval authorities will take appropriate measures to protect the rights and interests of Japanese people. Commander Shiozawa also sent copies of this ultimatum to the Japanese Consulate, the Public Works Department, and the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Advertisement in Japanese Newspaper: Yesterday, the Headquarters of the First Japanese Fleet stationed in Shanghai published an advertisement in a local Japanese newspaper, stating that if the city government's reply is not satisfactory, the fleet will take stern countermeasures.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun Speaks: Yesterday, a reporter from the "Japan-China News Agency" asked Secretary Yu Hongjun of the city government whether the Japanese fleet commander had submitted an ultimatum. Mr. Yu strongly denied it, saying that since the Japanese atrocities occurred, apart from a protest letter from the Japanese Consul regarding the assault on a monk, the city government had not received a single document from the Japanese side. The reports in the British and American newspapers that the ultimatum was submitted by the commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in Shanghai are untrue. The commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in Shanghai has no right to make any written or oral demands directly to this government. Such rumors are simply absurd.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents' General Meeting: Japanese residents of this city will hold a general meeting at the Peng Road Club at 3:00 PM today. According to inquiries, after the Japanese finish their meeting, they will organize a procession to North Sichuan Road and other places in Hongkou.</p>
<p>Authorities on Alert: The city government yesterday specifically ordered the Public Security Bureau to take appropriate precautions. After receiving the order, the Municipal Public Security Bureau ordered the Sixth Squadron Leader Sun Mou of the Police Brigade to lead more than 130 policemen from his entire squadron to be stationed near the border between the Chinese and International Settlements in North Sichuan Road, and to jointly defend with the police from various districts of the Fifth District. If necessary, the troops from the joint defense office of the army and police of the Zhabei Huzhou Guild Hall can assist nearby. The precautions were already very thorough last night. The authorities of the International Settlement, also for the sake of maintaining public order, have prepared several police vehicles and reserve forces of the Volunteer Corps and Chinese and Western detectives to patrol the Hongkou area closely.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Sun Ke's Telegram to the Six Major Organizations <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Hoping for 10 Million Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>Representatives from all circles in Shanghai, including Li Fuxun, Zhang Gongquan, Qin Runqing, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, etc., previously discussed with Mayor Wu Tiecheng on assisting the central government in its financial difficulties and drafted five principles. Yesterday, President Sun Ke of the Executive Yuan sent a telegram to the six major organizations in this port, providing answers regarding the content of the principles and requesting monthly assistance of ten million yuan to stabilize the overall situation. The original telegram is as follows: Shanghai Jianghai Customs 2.5% Surtax National Treasury Bond Fund Custody Committee, National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Banking Association of Shanghai, Shanghai Money Trade Association, and the Holders Association of Domestic Public Bonds and Treasury Bills of the Republic of China, all respectfully informed. Minister Huang Hanliang of the Ministry of Finance forwarded the telegram from Vice Minister Lin Kanghou, which has been carefully read. The government deeply sympathizes with the consolidation of credit. The Ministry of Finance has been ordered to instruct the Customs and Salt Administration and the Inspectorate General of Customs to handle the matter diligently. The tax supervision provision can be temporarily retained. As for the Central Bank, in accordance with the resolutions of the Peace Conference, it is now separated from politics. The Minister of Finance no longer concurrently serves as the Governor, which is already a fact. Furthermore, Vice Governor Xu is publicly recommended by the financial community, so there are no problems. However, military and political expenses have been repeatedly reduced, and the needs are still great. It is hoped that the people will cooperate with the government and strive to provide ten million yuan per month to stabilize the overall situation. This is earnestly hoped for. Special telegram reply from Sun Ke, President of the Executive Yuan. Ma.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Huang Hanliang Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Negotiating Loans with the Shanghai Financial Community Yesterday</p>
<p>Vice Minister Lin Kanghou Also Officially Assumed Office Yesterday</p>
<p>The Financial Community Has Agreed to a Loan of Eight Million</p>
<p>Complete Negotiations Should Be Completed Within Two or Three Days</p>
<p>Huang Hanliang, the Acting Minister of Finance, resigned in anger previously because someone in the central government proposed a plan to suspend the payment of principal and interest on bonds, and he was unable to prevent it. Vice Minister Lin Kanghou also continued to submit his resignation. Now, the central government's plan to suspend the payment of principal and interest has been canceled, and both Huang and Lin have been strongly urged to remain in their positions by the Executive Yuan. Huang officially assumed his duties in the ministry the day before yesterday and came to Shanghai from Beijing the night before last to negotiate financial issues. He arrived at the Finance Office on the Bund at 10:00 AM yesterday morning and immediately convened the Shanghai banking community to discuss loans. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Morning Talks: After arriving at the office, Huang and Lin immediately convened the heads of the Shanghai banking community for talks, stating that the central government's military and political expenses were urgently needed and should be discussed immediately. Those who attended included Zhang Gongquan, Li Fuxun, Bei Songsun, Chen Guangfu,</p>
<p>Xu Jiyin, and others. Huang stated at the time that the central financial</p>
<p>situation was difficult and that he had repeatedly sought loans from the Shanghai banking community. He said that the Shanghai community deeply understood the central government's financial difficulties and agreed to maintain it, but the amount had not yet been agreed upon. He said that he had reassumed his position as Minister of Finance and that the current difficulty was this matter. He sincerely asked the Shanghai community to do everything possible to maintain national finances. Everyone present expressed their agreement and promised to do their best to mediate with the Shanghai community.</p>
<p>Afternoon Meeting: At 6:00 PM in the afternoon, Huang and Lin reconvened the entire Shanghai banking community, money trade, and exchange representatives. The bank representatives included Bei Songsun from the Bank of China, Hu Mengjia from the Bank of Communications, Xu Xinliu from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Chen Guangfu from the Shanghai Bank, Chen Zheqing from the Salt Bank, Sun Jingxi from the Zhongfu Bank, Yu Huikui from the Juxingcheng Bank, Sun Hengfu from the Siming Bank, Yao Desheng from the China Bank, Wu Yunzhai from the Jin Cheng Bank, Wang Zhixin from the Xinhua Bank, Wu Weiru from the Donghua Bank, Ye Fuxiao from the Dalu Bank, Xu Baoqi from the Yongheng Bank, Liu Huizhi from the China Industrial Bank, Wang Xinguan from the Commercial Bank of China, Hu Bijiang from the Zhongnan Bank, Xu Yeming from the Hefeng Bank, Xu Youming from the Jiangsu Bank, Tang Shoumin from the Guohua Bank, Wang Boyuan from the Kenye Bank, Zhang Rongfu from the Guangdong Bank, Ling Wenli from the Dongya Bank, Wang Tianjia from the Zhongxing Bank, and Qi Yunqing from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. Representatives from the money trade included Pei Yunqing, and representatives from the exchange included Zhang Weiru, among others. Huang presided over the meeting, reporting on the circumstances of his reinstatement and the urgent need for the central government's finances to be maintained by all sectors. The representatives spoke one after another, expressing their willingness to do their best to maintain the loan issue, but requested that the central government be aware of the difficulties of the current situation and find ways to further reduce expenses. The meeting adjourned at around 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Loan Amount: According to a certain representative of the banking community who attended yesterday's meeting, speaking to a reporter from the "East China News Agency," Huang's visit to Shanghai to raise loans was a continuation of the scope of discussions that Wu Tiecheng had with various Shanghai organizations some time ago. The central government still needs a large sum of ten million yuan. The Shanghai community still hopes to strive to reduce it, but according to the results of yesterday's discussion, the Shanghai organizations have agreed to try to raise eight million yuan. Huang is also willing to report to the central government. This loan will be jointly borne by the banking and money trade sectors and the exchange. It should be completed within three to five days, but how the banking, money trade, and exchange sectors will allocate the burden has not yet been agreed upon.</p>
<p>Huang's Statement: A reporter from the "East China News Agency" visited Huang yesterday, asking the following questions: (1) After canceling his resignation this time, what new plans does he have for the future of finance? (2) Has the interception of taxes by various provinces been completely eliminated? (3) Has the Shanghai banking industry agreed to a loan of eight million yuan? (4) How to maintain the sharp decline in public bonds? Huang asked Vice Minister Lin Kanghou to answer on his behalf: (1) After canceling his resignation this time, there are plans to reorganize and maintain financial issues, which will be implemented successively. (2) The central government has issued a unified order to all provinces not to intercept taxes, and most provinces have expressed that they will not intercept taxes. (3) The loan amount from the Shanghai banking community, eight million yuan, is getting closer, but is still under negotiation. (4) There is a complete plan to maintain public bonds, and the Customs Service has been ordered to prepare a security form for the public bond fund to ensure that the people of the country are convinced of the reliability of public bonds.</p>

<p>All Officers and Crew Rescued</p>
<p>Navy Department Decides to Salvage</p>
<p>The Jiangyuan warship of the Second Fleet of the Navy unfortunately ran aground and sank near Xinghua Port in Fujian last year. The Mitsubishi Salvage Company managed to salvage it, tow it to Shanghai, and put it in dry dock for repairs. It took four months and cost more than 100,000 yuan to complete the repairs. It had just been completed the day before yesterday and was heading to Beijing to participate in the exercises. Unexpectedly, the Yuzhang torpedo boat of the torpedo boat fleet ran aground and sank in Lujing Port, Nantong Prefecture, at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Sinking: The ship was originally stationed in Nantong. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, it received an order from the Navy Department to go to Zhenjiang. Unexpectedly, when approaching Lujing Port, it suddenly encountered dense fog and lost its way, running aground on the Qingtian Reef. At that time, the tide was surging and there was no way to rescue it, so it sank.</p>
<p>Crew Rescued: At that time, the Daqing ship of the Dada Company happened to pass by, so it managed to rescue all the officers and crew of the ship to the ship. At the same time, the Yingrui warship, which was stationed in Jiangyin, was the first to receive a radio report from the Daqing ship about the accident and sailed to the scene. At around 7:00 PM, it approached the Daqing ship and transferred the Yuzhang crew from the Daqing to the Yingrui. The headquarters of the First Fleet of the Navy in this port received a radio report from the Yingrui at around 8:00 PM the night before last, reporting the details of the accident.</p>
<p>Salvage Operations Underway: At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Navy Department and Acting Permanent Vice Minister, went to the headquarters of the First Fleet to discuss the aftermath with Vice Minister Chen Jiliang. However, the exact circumstances of the accident and the current state of the ship are not yet known, so it is difficult to determine the responsibility of the personnel in charge of the ship. However, salvage operations have already been actively launched.</p>
<p>Total Number of Crew Members: The ship had a total of 81 officers and crew members, including one captain with the rank of colonel, one executive officer with the rank of lieutenant commander, one chief engineer with the rank of lieutenant commander, one torpedo and electrical officer with the rank of lieutenant, one assistant engineer with the rank of lieutenant, one assistant electrical officer with the rank of lieutenant junior grade, one navigator with the rank of lieutenant, one clerk with the rank of second lieutenant, one assistant electrical officer with the rank of second lieutenant, two warrant officer chief engineers, one warrant officer chief gunner, one warrant officer chief engineer, one warrant officer chief torpedo officer, one warrant officer chief electrician, and 66 sailors. All were rescued.</p>
<p>Ship's Overview: The ship was built in Germany in the second year of the Xuantong reign (1910). There were a total of three ships, including the Jiankang and Jianwei in addition to the Yuzhang. The price was more than 1.4 million taels. The displacement was 390 tons, the length was 208 feet, the width was 21 feet, and the depth was 10 feet. The armament included two 2-inch guns, four 2-pound guns, and eighteen 2-inch torpedoes. During the exercises in Xiangshan Port last year, it lost a torpedo in the sea. It took a week to recover it. The captain, Ren Guanghai, is on sick leave, and all ship affairs are currently being handled by the executive officer, Feng, on an acting basis.</p>

<p>Emergency Meeting of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association: The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association convened an emergency meeting of its executive committee yesterday in response to the riots in Shanghai by the Japanese. Chu Huiseng was elected chairman. The chairman began by reporting the purpose of the meeting. After passionate speeches by various committee members, the following resolutions were passed: (1) issue a declaration; (2) telegraph the central government to sever diplomatic relations with Japan; (3) request the municipal government to reject all unreasonable demands from the Japanese side; (4) notify all sectors to adopt appropriate self-defense measures; (5) appoint Zhu Zifan and Gong Yuting as representatives of the association to express sympathy to the workers of the Sanyou Industrial Company and the citizens of Yinxiang Port. (1) Declaration: The violent Japanese, relying on their military force, have invaded and occupied the territory of our three northeastern provinces and slaughtered countless of our compatriots. All Chinese people are filled with grief and indignation. Even before the bloodstains of Shenyang are dry, the disturbances in Tianjin and Qingdao have risen again. After the party headquarters in Qingdao was burned, the tragedy in Fujian revived. With such violent acts violating international conventions and disrupting world peace, the Japanese have not repented. Now, they dare to carry out their murderous and arsonist behavior in Shanghai, the economic center of the world. This is not only a loss of international courtesy to the people of the Republic of China, but also a fundamental shaking of the security of the Shanghai Public Concession. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Our association, born from all sectors of Shanghai, bears the important mission of resisting Japan and saving the nation. At this critical juncture, we must intensify our work and never succumb to the threats and coercion of the violent Japanese. We dare to solemnly declare that we hope that the citizens of Shanghai will face the crisis of national destruction and family ruin with a determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats. On the one hand, they should seek appropriate self-defense, and on the other hand, they should thoroughly implement economic severance. Our colleagues in the association will be committed to this cause from beginning to end, even unto death. We respectfully submit this declaration for your public consideration. (2) Telegram to the National Government: To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The violent Japanese, relying on their military force, have invaded our territory, harmed our people, disregarded international law, and disrupted world peace. For several months, such brutal acts have been numerous. Even before the bloodstains of Shenyang are dry, the tragedy in Tianjin has followed. We are struggling to resist Japan and save the nation, but the Japanese are intensifying their actions, daring to openly expose their ferocious faces in Shanghai, the center of culture and commerce, committing murder and arson, recklessly disregarding everything, and deploying troops and generals as if facing a major enemy. Such barbarism is not self-aware and has even made unreasonable demands on our country’s authorities. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Our colleagues in the association believe that this kind of action by the violent Japanese is clearly a planned and organized step, not an accidental outbreak. This proves that the violent Japanese have no respect for international etiquette towards our country. We urge the government to make a decisive decision and declare a severance of diplomatic relations with Japan. If we continue to compromise, we fear the country will perish soon. Our colleagues in the association have the determination to resist Japan and save the nation. Even if we are beheaded, we will not retreat. In urgent telegram, we are extremely eager and await orders. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, bowing. (3) Telegram to the Municipal Government: To Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government: The Japanese violence in Shanghai this time is actually a planned and organized step by the Japanese, not an accidental outbreak. This can be proven by the Japanese acts of violence against our country. The Japanese have not repented of their brutal acts, but have dared to make unreasonable demands, even requesting our government to stop the anti-Japanese movement. Our colleagues in the association, witnessing this murderous and arsonist barbarity and unreasonable coercion, are filled with outrage. We believe that the national salvation movement is a legitimate action by the people of any country to protect their country and cannot be subdued by any force. We urge your Excellency to firmly reject the unreasonable demands of the Japanese and not be intimidated by their power in order to protect the spirit of national salvation. Our colleagues in the association are willing to serve as a backing until death. Urgent words may be poorly chosen, but we hope you will understand. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, bowing.</p>

<p>Fei Xindun Expressed that There is No Need to Worry About Security</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, shops along North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road have been actively discussing self-defense measures since the riots in which Japanese people gathered to smash glass windows and beat residents. They convened a joint meeting of members from the 17th and 25th districts at the Qingnianhui the day before yesterday. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The association specially sent representatives to the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon to meet with the President Fei Xindun to make demands. Fei's important statement was satisfactory. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives' Demands: The representatives sent to the Municipal Council yesterday were Wang Jian'e, Chen Jiufeng, and Xing Minyi. The original text of their demands is as follows: "Presenting a case regarding Japanese ruffians relying on violence to injure people and smash stores, requesting serious action. On January 20, five to six hundred Japanese ruffians suddenly appeared on North Sichuan Road, relying on violence to injure people without reason, disrupting public order, burning factories, and resisting arrest. The details have been reported in various newspapers. Our association is concerned and has a responsibility. Therefore, we convened a meeting on the 21st and resolved three points: (1) Please ask your president to be responsible for ordering the Japanese consulate to fulfill its obligations of punishing the perpetrators, paying compensation, and formally apologizing to the stores on this road. (2) If your president cannot maintain security, the militia organized by our association are all store employees, formal merchants, and have the same status as the International Volunteer Corps. We request your president to allow our militia to assist in patrols and allow us to provide our own firearms, and stores can also provide a handgun to prevent unforeseen events. All firearms should be exempt from consultation fees. Our association is willing to take full responsibility for any negligence. (3) If the same incident occurs again in the future, merchants and residents will have no choice but to automatically exempt all donations for the sake of life and property, and keep them for self-defense expenses. The above three points have been resolved by the meeting. In addition to submitting a formal letter, the meeting specially appointed representatives Wang Jian'e, Chen Jiufeng, and Xing Minyi to meet and seek instructions. We sincerely hope to be received and taught. Respectfully addressed to the President of the Municipal Council."</p>
<p>Fei's Statement: At 3:40 pm, a meeting was held with President Fei Xindun on the second floor of the Municipal Council, lasting for half an hour. Fei stated: "The security of the concession has now been agreed upon by the consuls of various countries. The most trained troops will be sent out to maintain order. If necessary, the navy can also land. Therefore, there is no problem with the security of the concession. It is reported that Japanese residents will hold a general meeting in Peng Road tomorrow (i.e., today). The Municipal Council has also made full preparations and has sufficient military force to maintain order. Therefore, we hope that residents will not make a fuss." The representatives reiterated the losses suffered by the stores on North Sichuan Road due to the smashing of glass windows by the Japanese. Fei also agreed to inform the Japanese consul. There was no mention of self-defense and other issues.</p>

<p>And Specifies Regular Holidays and Dismissal Periods</p>
<p>Since the local Qian industry adopted the Gregorian calendar, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has informed them that the end of the general account period is the end of January. The end of this session coincides with the various impacts felt by various industries, and there is great fear that outstanding debts will not be repaid on schedule. Therefore, it was proposed a few days ago to set the general account period to be the end of January, but it was decided to extend it by five days to February 5, as there were still unfinished business after the end of the period. From February 6, 7, and 8, the industry will be closed to deal with internal matters. All dismissal issues for partners will also be carried out during the above three-day holiday.</p>

<p>Warning Telegram to Zhang Jinghui</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday, the Zhejiang National Crisis Relief Association held its third council meeting at the Quan Zhe Gonghui in Lianzhuli, Aiwenyi Road. In addition to passing important agendas such as the Zhejiang National Crisis Relief Association's liaison regulations for county associations and draft national salvation outlines, Councillor Zhu Duomin and others proposed that the Northeast Volunteer Army be transferred to Jinxi to resist the violent Japanese. Their spirit of sacrificing their lives to defend the country is comparable to General Ma Zhanshan. How should our national people provide assistance and remotely cheer them up to encourage their morale? It was decided that the association would first raise 1,000 yuan as a start and then continue to raise funds to continuously provide assistance to avoid the danger of the patriotic volunteers running out of ammunition and supplies.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang National Crisis Relief Association sent a warning telegram to Zhang Jinghui in Harbin: "To Zhang Jinghui, Supervisor of Harbin, The Japanese army is trampling on the Eastern Provinces, which is resented by both humans and gods. You, sir, have received the country's favor and hold an important border post. If you cannot defend the country with weapons, nor can you sacrifice your life in times of danger, you should at least confine yourself and await punishment to apologize to the people of the country. The people of the world and future generations may sympathize with your decline or understand you. Now, letters and telegrams are pouring in, all claiming that you are selling out the country for personal gain and obstructing our righteous army. Being so confused, how can you not feel pain? Being pointed at by thousands of people, you will die without disease. Wealth and honor are fleeting clouds, and public opinion is to be feared. If you do not repent, there will be those who are willing to capture you and be satisfied. What the heart feels is dangerous, I dare not fail to inform you. Leaving behind a good or bad reputation, make your choice quickly. Zhejiang National Crisis Relief Association, Respectfully"</p>

<h3 id="e156">Li Jingcong Talks About His Experience with the Northwest Test Flight <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Xinjiang Province: Although Xinjiang Province is located in a remote border area, its land is vast, its resources are abundant, and its reserves are rich, surpassing any other province in the interior. This is why outsiders covet it. As the saying goes, "Elephants are burned because of their tusks." If the Chinese people continue to ignore the situation in the province and do not seek ways to develop it, I fear that the near future will repeat the fate of the Northeast. If the Northwest, the screen of the country, is lost, then Gansu, Shaanxi, and even the interior provinces will be in danger one by one. I will not hesitate to be detailed and briefly describe the situation in the Northwest as far as I know. (1) Ethnic groups: According to the investigation, the total population of Xinjiang Province is no more than four million. Han people account for about one-fifth, all of whom are immigrants. The rest are Uyghurs, Hui, Mongols, and White Russians who fled in after the European War. All ethnic groups maintain their inherent etiquette, religion, and dialects. Although they are all happy and prosperous and do not infringe on each other, the Hui people do not have a very harmonious relationship with the Han people due to historical reasons, and they also account for the majority of the population. If there is no external aggression, this alone is enough to make Xinjiang Province unstable from time to time. (2) Culture: Although Xinjiang Province is the birthplace of mankind, it is impossible for new cultures from the outside world to enter due to traffic blockades. Also, because the land is vast and the resources are abundant, everyone has enough food and clothing. The old culture cannot be developed. At present, there are only a few primary and secondary schools in the province, and one Tianshan Daily. Higher institutions of learning are as rare as morning stars. When the company's plane arrived in Dihua on December 22, the Shanghai newspapers of December 12 and the Tianjin newspapers of December 19, as well as the China Weekly, were regarded as treasures and marked the beginning of a new culture in Xinjiang Province. As of January 7, when we left Dihua, the news published by Tianshan Daily was still reprinted from the news that we brought on December 20. (3) Transportation: Except for the dozens of cars owned by the provincial government, Xinjiang Province relies on mule carts and horse carts for ordinary long-distance transportation. Therefore, it takes seventeen or eight days to travel from the provincial capital to border counties such as Tacheng and Yili, and two or three months to reach Shufu and Heyu. Even from the interior to Xinjiang Province, it is not possible to travel in less than three months. Russia has built the Turkestan Railway along the border of Xinjiang Province and has set up many airfields. Therefore, Russia does not want to invade Xinjiang Province, but if it wants to invade, hundreds of thousands of people can cross the border in an instant. Even if we want to gather the military force of the province in one place in the shortest possible time and confront them, it is impossible. It is even more hopeless to transport reinforcements from the interior. (4) Production: The climate north of the Tianshan Mountains is cold, and the production of furs, feathers, and hides is extremely abundant. South of the Tianshan Mountains, the climate is warm, and grains and fruits are harvested every year. In addition, gold is mixed in the rivers, oil flows on the ground, and fuel is readily available everywhere. All kinds of metals are found throughout the mountains. In this naturally rich area, except for the Chinese people who are drunk with life and dreaming of death and arguing all day long, they do not know how to go there to develop it, enrich the country and benefit the people, and consolidate the border and defend the outside. Is there any reason not to inspire people's covetousness? (5) Commerce: What Xinjiang Province needs from the interior are silk, tea, ginseng, shark fins, cosmetics, daily necessities, etc. Merchants from the interior who transport goods go to the place of production and engage in exchange. Then, they transport the exchanged goods back to the interior for sale. The currency system in Xinjiang Province is different from that in the interior. Each tael is only equal to two jiao of silver, and the exchange rate is extremely expensive. It is not enough to make a profit unless they do so. However, this kind of exchange is ultimately inconvenient, so the number is very limited. In addition, soldiers and bandits appear and disappear unpredictably along the way, and it is easy to be robbed on the way back and forth, so merchants are increasingly afraid to make isolated bets. Xinjiang Province has no choice but to exchange large-scale cheap goods such as furs and cotton with Russia because it needs foreign goods. In order to realize its five-year plan, Russia does not want the goods of the interior to reach Xinjiang Province. Therefore, in addition to exchange, there are also regulations for cheap sales from time to time. For example, the kerosene sold in Xinjiang Province is better than that refined in the province, and the price is cheaper than that refined in Xinjiang Province. Another example is cigarettes, each box contains fifty cigarettes, which must be sold for four yuan in Russia, but only two jiao and five fen are sold on the Sino-Russian border, and the price is reduced to two jiao when transported to Dihua. If the Chinese people still ignore this and do not seek a way to save it, the commerce between the interior and Xinjiang Province will be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Preparation for Launching the Regular Flight: Although this test flight was successful, there are still many things that need to be prepared for the official launch of the regular flight, and the difficulties are even greater than those of the test flight. In addition to reporting the experience gained from the test flight to the two general managers, we are now preparing a plan based on the experience in order to submit it to the board of directors for approval and start the plan. The outline is roughly as follows: (1) Ground equipment: The test flight results show that the line from Shanghai to Weitangzi, except for the Shanghai-Ping segment, is mostly high mountains and steep ridges, that is, barren wilderness. Especially the section from Langshan to the Tianshan Mountains, except for the weak water river, there are no human settlements, the climate is harsh, no grass or trees grow, and all living things are extinct. It is the most difficult and unsuitable air route for flight safety in the world. On this entire line, in addition to very proper radio equipment, climate measurement equipment, emergency equipment, health equipment, and equipment for parking aircraft and storing gasoline, there should also be traffic equipment, such as driving cars, etc., so that there is a possibility of rescue in case of emergency. Otherwise, it is not complete in terms of safety. However, from Guihua to the Sino-Russian border in Xinjiang Province, there are no trains or cars that can be used. The various ground equipment mentioned above can only be transported by the company's own cars, reluctantly. In the future, they will be left as traffic aids in remote areas. On the one hand, camels should be hired to slowly transport them. If there are no other difficult problems in the middle, it is estimated that it will take more than four months to complete the layout. (2) Selection of parts: According to the results of our investigation in Xinjiang Province, the number of valuable goods that can be transported by plane is very limited. Because there is not much commercial exchange with the interior, there are not many mails. It is decided to select the Junkers W33 No. 33 all-metal fuselage, which is not easily damaged and is suitable for long-distance flights, and the Junkers L5 No. 5 2-300 horsepower engine. With this aircraft, if the maximum distance can be set at one station every 600 kilometers, then in addition to the aircraft itself, the weight of everything is about 1,700 kg, plus about 600 kg for loading gasoline, the driver, and the radio operator, at least 6-700 kg of goods and mail or passengers can be carried. Compared with using a large aircraft, all expenses will have to be increased, but in reality, there are no such goods, mail, and passengers that need to be flown empty, which is not economical. (3) Funding: Whether this line can be officially launched five months after preparation according to our plan depends on the availability of funding. At this time, there is no certainty. The company is jointly organized by the Chinese Ministry of Communications and the German Lufthansa Airlines. According to the contract, the Ministry of Communications should recognize two-thirds of the share capital, and Lufthansa should recognize one-third. However, Lufthansa has been considering the opening because the Northwest route has no profit to be made and has no close relationship with itself. The Ministry of Communications is unable to pay at one time due to financial difficulties, except for relying on the government. This Northwest route, which is attracting worldwide attention, hoped for by the whole country, and related to the survival of the Northwest, although we have successfully test-flown it with the determination to sacrifice, may become a flash in the pan due to economic problems and cannot be launched. In addition, one more thing should be noted by charitable organizations: Since December of last year in Xinjiang Province, as of the day we flew back to the mainland, more than 3,000 young children have died of scarlet fever and diphtheria due to the lack of appropriate medicines for treatment. The new Xinjiang Provincial Government entrusted me to ask the Beijing Epidemic Prevention Office to purchase various medicines for treating and preventing these diseases when flying through Beiping and send them as soon as possible. However, the power of that office is limited and is like a drop in the bucket. It is feared that it will be of no avail. I hope that all charitable organizations will show mercy and quickly purchase medicines suitable for treating and preventing these diseases and send them directly to the "Xinjiang Provincial Government to be transferred to the Xinjiang Provincial Epidemic Prevention Bureau" for application. Is there any limit to the benefit of the elders and younger brothers in Xinjiang Province? Otherwise, it will be even more unimaginable when spring arrives. The best way to send it is to pack every two or three bottles into a small package, as a letter, marked "Via the Siberian route," and deliver it to the post office to be sent to the Xinjiang Provincial Government. It will definitely arrive within a month and a half. Otherwise, it will not arrive in Xinjiang for more than half a year. Also, small packages of letters should not be too heavy or too large, because Russia does not allow packages to be transported through the Siberian Railway to any place.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Italy-China Express Ship Breaks the European Route Record <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Can Reach Italy in Twenty-Four Days</p>
<p>The First Ship Arrives in Shanghai on February 2</p>
<p>This year, the Italian Post Company in this city has opened a special fast class for the China trade, stipulating that it can reach Italy in 24 days, creating a new era in the shipping industry between Central Europe. The following is a detailed report by the reporter after careful investigation. Company development: Since the Italian Post Company cooperated with the Italian C.osulich Line and then joined forces with the Italian Lloyd Sabando, its business strength has become stronger. It has concentrated all its efforts on operating the shipping industry between East India, Bombay, and China, so it has added new ships and launched special express classes.</p>
<p>Increase in Fast Ships: The company's postal ships in China originally had four ships, and the usual journey between China and Italy took 35 days. The company then changed and transferred two high-speed ships to China, one called the Conte Verde and one called the Conte Rosso. The Conte Verde had arrived in Shanghai earlier, and the Conte Rosso, which has a load capacity of 18,000 tons and can travel 20 nautical miles per hour, is scheduled to arrive in China on the first flight on February 10. After the new ship joins, the original postal ship Krakowiak will be withdrawn and will not operate.</p>
<p>Shorten the Sea Route: The first flight of the two express postal ships added this time will arrive in Shanghai on February 2, and the second flight will depart on February 8. The third flight is scheduled for March 11. From then on, the sea route between China and Italy can be shortened by one-third. The schedule of the fast class is now specified as follows: Shanghai to Hong Kong in 2 days, to Singapore in 5+ days, to Colombo in 9+ days, to Mumbai in 12+ days, to Port Said in 20 days, to Brindisi in 23 days, and to Trieste in Italy in 24 days.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Municipal Council Does Not Appeal Against Yan Bing <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yan Bing, an inspector of the Coal Industry Association, was declared innocent by the First Special District Court. Fearing that the police would file an appeal, he was instructed to hand in the guarantees within the appeal period. This has been reported in this newspaper. This morning, Judge Feng Shide visited the Second Criminal Court for the hearing. During the criminal appeal, the police lawyer Yi Yaotang stood up and stated that the Municipal Council had waived the right to appeal against the defendant Yan Bing. Judge Feng then instructed the Municipal Council to declare that it would not appeal against Yan Bing and that the bail should be revoked.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Tragic Eye-Gouging Plot of Brothers <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Because Younger Brother Repeatedly Stole</p>
<p>Older Brother Conspired with Youngest Brother to Use Cruel Hand</p>
<p>Afterward, Younger Brother Returned Home to Tell Father</p>
<p>Older Brother Surrendered Himself to the Police Station</p>
<p>Wang Yunyu from Shandong Province resided in a shed at Number 6, Sanfuli, Sanyang Road, Zhabei, and made a living running a sesame cake shop. He had a total of five brothers. Among them, Wang Yungao, 34 years old, and Wang Yunbiao, 28 years old, were working as road construction laborers. Yesterday, around noon, Wang Yunyu and his brother Yunbiao invited Yungao for lunch, plying him with a large amount of alcohol, causing him to become extremely drunk. Then, the two brothers, Yunyu and Yunbiao, used sharpened bamboo tubes to violently stab Yungao's eyes and gouge out both eyeballs. Yungao, in extreme pain, woke up from his drunken stupor, shouted loudly, and collapsed, losing consciousness. Yunyu, after the incident, surrendered himself to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau substation on Xibao Xing Road, stating that because his brother Wang Yungao had repeatedly committed theft, he gouged out his eyes. He also said that Yunbiao had already traveled back to their hometown in Shandong Province to report the matter to their parents. The substation then transferred Wang to the Fifth District Headquarters for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Heda Foreign Goods Store Found to Have a Large Batch of Japanese Goods <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Inspectors Wrongfully Detained by the Bureau</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Will Severely Punish</p>
<p>The Zhonghua News Agency reports that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's Inspection Department in this city is intensifying its inspection of Japanese goods. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 22nd), when members were dispatched to inspect Japanese goods at the Heda Foreign Goods Store on Hengfeng Road, a dispute arose. Details obtained are recorded below:</p>
<p>It was previously reported that after the Anti-Japanese Association rigorously enforced the inspection of Japanese goods, unscrupulous merchants in the city still used the concessions as protection, recklessly seeking private gain, disregarding national peril, and secretly importing large quantities of Japanese goods. Many cases have been uncovered one after another. Unexpectedly, in recent days, it has been widely rumored in the market that foreign goods stores in the Zhabei Hengfeng Road area in the Chinese territory have been secretly importing Japanese goods and smuggling Japanese cloth at night. The Municipal Anti-Japanese Association has repeatedly received secret reports requesting a strict investigation to deter cunning individuals and thoroughly implement the initial intention of economic severance.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Anti-Japanese Association paid close attention. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, it dispatched special inspection team members Ju Zongyan and two others to foreign goods stores on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei to conduct inspections. When they inspected Heda Foreign Goods Store, located at number 225, run by Liu Jincheng from Zhenjiang, a large quantity of Japanese cloth was found. Unexpectedly, the store's employees lured them upstairs, locked the doors, and beat them severely. They also falsely reported to the police that items had been robbed, resulting in the detention of inspector Ju Zongyan at the Second Branch of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. Another inspector immediately reported to the Anti-Japanese Association for assistance. After receiving the news, the Anti-Japanese Association immediately dispatched a large team to rush to the scene to re-investigate and seize the goods. The Japanese cloth hidden in the building above the Yuanbiao Clothing Store at number 223 next door was found to amount to hundreds of bolts, which were loaded into two trucks and sent to the association's Zhabei storage depot for safekeeping.</p>
<p>The store owner, Liu Jincheng, seeing that the matter had escalated, incited his mother, who was over sixty years old, to go to the Second Branch of the Fourth District to accuse the inspectors, including Ju Zongyan, of stealing gold rings and bracelets. The branch, considering the matter extremely complex, conducted a brief interrogation and decided to send the case to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association believed that the store dared to violently assault inspectors amidst the serious outcry against goods, deliberately sabotaging the patriotic movement, and were truly public enemies of the people. In addition to confiscating all of the store's Japanese goods, they also detained the shop assistants involved in the assault, Liu Xiaochen, Bo Houzai, Yang Xiangyun, and others, and placed them in the association's Zhabei Investigation Office to await punishment. It is also learned that after the case occurred, the Anti-Japanese Association's Executive Committee and the association's staff jointly convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>No Additional Postage Fees</p>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports that, according to an announcement yesterday by the Shanghai Postal Administration, the Chinese and Japanese postal authorities have reached an agreement that all mail sent to various locations in the three northeastern provinces occupied by the Japanese will continue to be charged at normal rates, and no additional postage fees will be added. Restrictions on certain types of mail will also no longer be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Water Level Drops Sharply Below Xiaogushan Mountain <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>All Ships Reduce Load and Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports that yesterday, various shipping companies in this port received telegrams stating that the water level below Xiaogushan Mountain had dropped sharply, with a current depth of only seven feet and eight inches. As a result, the river route between Shanghai and Hankou was suspended yesterday (the 21st). All company ships upstream and downstream of Xiaogushan Mountain were unable to pass through the mountain. After receiving the telegram, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. immediately agreed to use shallow-draft cargo ships to transport goods and passengers, so as to lighten the ships' load and allow them to pass over the mountain and return to this port. Other companies will do the same after finding suitable cargo ships. The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Gonghe ship, which was originally scheduled to sail to Hankou yesterday, has been suspended and docked for repairs. Foreign businessmen are now afraid that river bandits will take advantage of the ships gathering near Xiaogushan Mountain to carry out robberies, so they have requested the commander of the British Navy in Shanghai to send a gunboat to the area for protection.</p>

<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Mr. Finch (transliteration), the British chief of the two-route machinery department, had served the railway bureau for eighteen years. His contract expired, and the bureau did not renew it, so he was dismissed the day before yesterday. It is now known that the bureau has appointed Wang Shengshan to fill the position. He took office yesterday. It is said that Wang is the president of Jiaotong University and has extensive knowledge and experience.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Zhu Qinglan Raises Funds to Aid Fellow Countrymen Who Fled to Beiping <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Wandering and Destitute, They Will Become Starving Corpses</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, a member of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, received a telegram from Beiping yesterday stating that the number of unemployed residents in the area has been increasing recently, crying out in hunger and suffering greatly. In addition, there are a large number of compatriots from the Northeast, who have been affected by the national disaster, who have fled to the old capital. Wandering and destitute, lacking food and clothing, their cries of grief fill the fields, waiting to be fed. If rescue is not urgently arranged, they will inevitably become starving corpses. This year's winter disaster relief porridge factories, due to the severe flooding in the Yangtze and Huai rivers, have had the attention and resources of benefactors shifted and transferred, failing to provide for all. As a result, raising funds is not easy. The disaster relief association's office in Beiping has been working hard to make ends meet, and has only set up five porridge factories. However, one factory in Shucun, a western suburb, has not yet opened. It is now planned to purchase rice and flour to distribute in the suburbs before the end of the old year and to distribute cotton clothing, but the amount is very small. Unless there are another 10,000 sets, they dare not start distributing them. According to statistics, the current need for emergency relief is at least 20,000 yuan. According to the telegram, Zhu has sent a letter to Mr. Wang Yiting, asking him to find ways to provide relief. The original letter said (omitted above): Sir, you are concerned about suffering and uphold virtue. I urge you to provide assistance and discuss with Chu Qing, Xian Qing, Qian Lin, and the three gentlemen, as well as other benefactors, to complete this supreme merit, so that the porridge factory in the western suburbs can be reopened and the cotton clothing in the suburbs can be distributed, so that hundreds of millions of mourners will not end up in ditches. It is said that Wang has proposed today to the sixth executive committee meeting of the water disaster emergency relief associations in various provinces to discuss relief measures.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Case of Embezzlement of Funds to Aid Ma (Zhanshan) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Transferred to the Prosecutor's Office for Investigation</p>
<p>Wu Mengyan, principal of Mingde School in Sande Lane, Zhabei, is being privately prosecuted in the criminal court of the local court by student representatives Xu Hongquan, Tang Shiliang, Xu Dingyi, and others for embezzlement of donations. The statement roughly states that after the Northeast Incident occurred, due to General Ma Zhanshan's courageous resistance, the Shanghai academic community decided to donate funds to provide assistance. This school collected a total of 52 teams of donations, a huge amount, but Wu announced that only 1,782.40 yuan were received. However, this school's seven teams have already exceeded this amount, let alone more than 50 teams. He privately split open bamboo tubes in the school and did not replace them after splitting open the 52 teams of bamboo tubes, revealing a major case of fraud. All the thank you cards were reprinted by him from the Minyi Printing House. Investigation showed that it was evidence of embezzlement. At that time, the party committees of the fourth and sixth districts and the Anti-Japanese Association went to the school to investigate and found that Wu Mengyan had embezzled 2,117.10 yuan. The actual amount was even higher. A report has been submitted to the Municipal Party Department and published in the public report. Therefore, they demanded punishment. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zhen opened the court. The defendant hired a lawyer to defend, saying that there was no embezzlement and that the plaintiffs were expelled students. However, the students claimed that the defendant was slandering them. The judge then instructed that the case was not sufficient for private prosecution and should be transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation before further review. Then, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e167">German Dean Robbed While Walking at Night <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Gold Watch and Eyeglasses Stolen</p>
<p>Total Value Over 300 Yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Lou Najun, a German and dean of academic affairs at the School of Engineering of National Tongji University in Wusong, arrived in Song by train from Shanghai at approximately 8:00 PM on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 21st). After getting off the train, because it was late, there were no rickshaws available, so he had to walk back to school. When he reached the corner of Taixing Road and North Tongji Road, four thugs suddenly appeared. They were wearing gray military uniforms and had symbols. They were holding box cannons and other fierce weapons, warning him not to make a sound. They took a gold watch worth more than 200 yuan, a pair of eyeglasses worth more than 30 yuan, and a gold ring and five or six yuan in cash from his pockets. After the robbery, the group left. After the thieves left, Dean Shi rushed back to the school and used the telephone to report to the Public Security Bureau's Seventh District and the Security Corps. The corps and police officers were dispatched to the scene, but the bandits had already fled far away and could not be pursued. However, this was not the first time that school staff members had been robbed in that area. Since the night of the 13th, when Lu Xixian, director of the school's middle school department, was robbed of more than 90 yuan in cash, other people, such as Dr. Tang, had also encountered similar bandits and were robbed of less than 10 yuan, so they did not report to the authorities. This was the third time that Dean Shi had been robbed. Tang Chengzong, commander of the Wusong Security Corps, in view of the endless robbery cases on Tongji Road, convened an emergency meeting of all the corps leaders and members at the corps headquarters last night to discuss defense measures to prevent future troubles.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Worker Commits Suicide Due to Poverty and Illness <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>New Ghost Under Xinqiao Bridge</p>
<p>Pity for Mother, Wife, and Children</p>
<p>At about 12:00 noon yesterday, a man resembling a worker suddenly jumped into the river under the Xinqiao Bridge in Yuncao Hamlet, Wusong. The men and women rowing sampans in the area saw it and rushed to rescue him. They rescued the man, but he was already at his last breath. Because the weather was cold and he had inhaled too much water, he soon died. A patrolman from the First Public Security Bureau of the Seventh District arrived at the scene. In the deceased's pocket, they found a pass issued by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, a half-body photograph of a worker's pass with the name Le Siliang written on it, and a piece of white paper with the address Number 1390, Xin Tao Yuan Li, opposite the Broadway Theater at the intersection of Huishan Road and Zhoushan Road written on it. The Public Security Bureau then contacted Zhao Maoqing, the head of the thirty-second precinct, and ordered him to go to Shanghai to notify his wife, Mrs. Yang, at the address. After receiving the news, she led her three children and Le's younger brother to Song. Upon seeing the corpse, they were extremely saddened and wept bitterly. According to reports, the reason for Le's suicide was that he was a laborer at the Zhanghuabang Railway Factory, and his wages were very low. He had an elderly mother above him and a wife and children below him, so his livelihood was very difficult. Recently, he had been ill for a long time. Yesterday, he heard the doctor say, "Your illness has been long-standing and will be difficult to cure in a short time. Moreover, the factory rules are now very strict. If you are sick for a long time, you will not receive any wages." Therefore, Le was extremely anxious. In addition, the end of the year was approaching, so he had the idea of committing suicide, resulting in this tragedy. The bridge was recently completed, and the completion ceremony has not yet taken place. It is also regrettable that Le Siliang jumped from this bridge.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Tan Zhiyuan Accused of Breach of Contract and Fraud <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Tan Zhiyuan, an actor at the Star Film Company, was recently accused of fraud by Li Yuanlong, manager of the Dahua Company, and is under investigation in the Second Special District Court. Yesterday, he was summoned for questioning again. Plaintiff Li Yuanlong stated that on December 29 of last year, the merchant signed a contract with the defendant Tan Zhiyuan, inviting him to perform at the Nanjing City Grand World Theater for a term of two years. At that time, the defendant received an advance payment of 300 yuan and borrowed 600 yuan in advance, totaling 900 yuan, for which he issued a receipt. Unexpectedly, after taking the money, the defendant delayed going. Suddenly, on the 15th of this month, it was reported in the newspaper that he had another contract with the Star Company. The merchant was surprised and questioned him, but he avoided meeting. It was not until the 18th that he learned that the defendant was filming at the Star Company, so he reported to the police to arrest him and requested an investigation. The proxy lawyers Dong Chi and Zhang Bingyun supplemented the statement of the case, submitted receipts and other evidence, and requested incidental private prosecution to recover the funds. Under questioning, Tan Zhiyuan stated that he also had a contract with the Star Company for a term of three years, expiring on September 30 of next year. In December of last year, he went to Beiping with all the staff of the Star Company to film "The Teasing Marriage." After returning to Shanghai, he suddenly received stimulation and decided to change his career. This matter was learned by the Dahua Company, which invited him to join Dahua. He immediately stated that his contract with the Star Company had not expired and it would be difficult to agree. He also said that it would be possible to do spoken drama. As a result, they signed a contract with him, but at that time, Wu Chengyu, the perennial legal advisor of the Dahua Company, stated that the contract signed with the Star Company was for filming, and the current contract was for spoken drama, so there was no conflict. Therefore, he was actually deceived into signing it. Later, all the actors of the Star Company learned of this and cried and pleaded with him repeatedly, so he could not bear to separate and continued to work there. At this point, the official ordered the start of arguments, and the police lawyer Fei Xizhen argued that the law states that a contract is a contract. The police felt that the defendant had committed fraud, so they accepted the prosecution. To know whether the fraud took place, it must be proven whether it was intentional before signing the contract. Now, investigation showed that Article 5 of the contract signed by the defendant stated that during the contract period, he could not perform or film movies elsewhere. It was intentional beforehand, and then a breach of contract was implemented, obviously a fraudulent act. He requested that it be dealt with in accordance with Article 363 of the Criminal Law. At the end, under the defense of the two lawyers hired by the defendant, Zhan Jifeng and Yang Zhihao, Judge Zhang Shijie declared the debate over and scheduled a date for sentencing. The defendant was detained in the court's detention center.</p>

<p>The rear advisory office of the Youth Automatic Northeast Aid Ma Anti-Japanese Corps received a telegram from the corps in Beiping yesterday, roughly stating that the corps originally planned to go to Heilongjiang via Rehe. Now, due to the loss of Jinzhou and the courageous resistance of the Northeast Volunteer Army against Japan, the plan has been changed. It has been decided to go directly to the Jinxi front line to assist the Volunteer Army in fighting Japan. Departure is scheduled for the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Jianghai Customs Limits Registration of Customs Brokers <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Deadline February 14</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Tax Department recently issued a notice stating, "For the purpose of notification, all Chinese and foreign commercial firms engaged in customs declaration business must register with the Customs before February 14 of this year. Those who have previously registered must re-register before this date. All application forms can be obtained from the Registration Section of the General Affairs Department of this Customs. The procedures are listed on the left. For domestic commercial firms, Chinese commercial firms should obtain a letter of guarantee, sealed and stamped by two reputable commercial firms, and submit it to the Taxation Division of the General Affairs Department of this Customs as a guarantee. This guarantee must also be signed and sealed by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce or the trade association to which the commercial firm belongs, guaranteeing that the commercial firm is a genuine commercial firm and does not engage in customs declaration business or declare goods for others. The validity period of this guarantee is limited to one year, and the guarantee must be renewed before the deadline, which is to be completed in January each year. The renewal procedure requires the guarantor to stamp the back of the guarantee, stating their willingness to continue the guarantee for one year. After the Customs receives the guarantee, the commercial firm must go to the Registration Office of the General Affairs Department to affix the firm's official letterhead and seal on a specially prepared card for record keeping. They must also submit two copies of the signature specimens of the firm's manager and other customs declaration staff. In addition, the firm must also fill out another form (Jianghai Customs No. 161) for the staff member authorized to sign and collect warehouse receipts, along with a photograph of the staff member, and submit them to the Customs together. The photograph must also bear the staff member's signature specimen. The procedure for domestic customs brokers is the same as for the aforementioned domestic commercial firms, but the guarantee item may not require other guarantees other than the guarantee that customs brokers should pay in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Foreign commercial firms and customs brokers: Foreign commercial firms and customs brokers must submit a registration application to the Registration Office of the General Affairs Department. Commercial firms with consular representatives in Shanghai do not need this procedure. Commercial firms or customs brokers from countries without treaties should submit their application to the Shanghai Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau for certification. The method of authorizing staff to stamp and collect warehouse receipts is the same as for domestic commercial firms.</p>
<p>General rules: All Chinese and foreign commercial firms that have complied with the above regulations will be deemed to have been registered and will be given a registration number. The commercial firm should then indicate the registration number in the upper left corner of the customs declaration form. All registered firms that subsequently change their name or nationality must prepare a registration application again, certified by the competent consul or the Shanghai Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau, and submit it to the Customs for verification. (Omitted below) All merchants are expected to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Yang Zhaoyun Bids Farewell to Court Staff <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yang Zhaoyun, president of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, has been in office for two years and has been engaged in rectifying court affairs. He is being transferred to the Guizhou Higher Court as the chief prosecutor and will formally hand over his responsibilities. He invited all colleagues from the court to a tea party at 4:00 PM on January 20 as a farewell. President Yang delivered a speech, roughly saying, "Brothers have been in office for nearly two years, and I am very grateful for the efforts and assistance of all colleagues in my daily work. I hope that all colleagues will be even more serious. This sentence will be my farewell message. The late Prime Minister often said that the purpose of life is service. In other words, service is no longer for personal food, clothing, and enjoyment, but for the responsibility of establishing oneself in society. However, various agencies often change leaders due to the political relations of our country, and officials often do not patrol their positions, even involving public affairs, thus leading to shelvings and pauses. This is not a good phenomenon. Since we know that the purpose of life is service, we should naturally fulfill our responsibilities for one day while in office. Moreover, the incoming president of this court is Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue, who has a long history with this court and has a considerable understanding of the spirit of employing people and handling affairs. He will definitely have good achievements in the future. My native place is Sichuan. After graduating from Peking University, I studied in France. I have always believed that talent is the main criterion for employing people since taking office. In the current use of personnel in this court, in addition to one or two Peking University classmates, no fellow villagers, classmates, or Sichuan relatives have been employed." Then, Court President Xu rose to speak on behalf of all the staff, saying that he has been working with President Yang for two years, and he has been very admired under President Yang's guidance during these two years. Now that President Yang has been ordered to be transferred to Guizhou, he hopes that President Yang will continue to give guidance in the future and wishes him good health. At the end, after President Yang's reply, all the colleagues in the court happily sent him off outside the court gate.</p>

<h3 id="e174">All Shuang Gong Silk Factories Closed <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Result of Poor European Sales</p>
<p>In the past, there was only one Jinglun silk factory with more than 200 silk reeling machines. Eight out of ten of the Shuang Gong cocoons produced in our country were transported to France, Japan, and other countries. In recent years, due to the sharp increase in the sales price of Shuang Gong silk overseas, silk prices have risen daily. Chinese silk merchants have purchased machinery and added Shuang Gong silk factories. For a time, Fulun, Ruilun, Honglun, Xinlun, Jinlun, Hongshunlun, and others emerged. At its peak, there were seven Shuang Gong silk factories in Shanghai. Since last autumn, Shuang Gong silk has been affected by the cheap sales of Japanese silk, and European sales have gradually become sluggish. The shortage of Shuang Gong cocoons and high prices have caused silk merchants to suffer losses and unable to support themselves. Jinglun, Hongshunlun, Xinlun, Jinlun, and other four factories have successively closed between last autumn and winter. The three factories of Honglun, Ruilun, and Fulun have struggled to work, but because European sales have not improved and the accounting period is approaching, funds are extremely tight. Each factory has no ability to maintain operations and has successively suspended work since the day before yesterday. At this point, all seven Shuang Gong silk factories in Shanghai have closed down.</p>

<p>No New Personnel Will Be Added or Examined This Year</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications has always adopted strict standards for the recruitment of staff and employees. Examinations are held separately in Shanghai, Huha, and Han. More than 20 candidates who were selected were graduates of well-known domestic universities. After a three-month probationary period, they were assigned to work in various branch offices and performed very well. It was originally planned to continue this year, but due to the current situation, the bank should adopt a savings policy. The existing staff is sufficient for application. It is said that the bank authorities have notified their subordinates to stop the examination and, from now on, not to add new staff and employees, in order to be pragmatic.</p>

<p>Since relocating to its new site at the intersection of Avenue Joffre last summer, Xiafei Sanatorium's medical services have flourished. Dr. Wu Tianmin and Dr. Zhu Yizhen have devoted themselves to the endeavor, sparing no effort, and all facilities are now complete and perfect. Recently, a young child named Dong Husheng, only six months old, suddenly developed a swollen abdomen and purplish skin. Doctors diagnosed pneumonia, and after several days of treatment, the child was on the verge of death, with no hope of recovery. Later, Yu Hesun from the Hanyang Arsenal sent the child to Xiafei Sanatorium. After examination by Dr. Wu, it was determined that the child had dysentery. He was immediately given a serum injection and underwent surgery, and recovered within days. The parents were extremely grateful, truly a benevolent art.</p>
<h3 id="e179">National Medicine Industry Opposes the Price Hike of Moutan Bark <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association, upon the suggestion of Executive Committee members Zhang Hongzhao and others, noted that Lexing (樂行) has been unilaterally raising the wholesale price of moutan bark (丹皮), engaging in unbridled monopolization. The closing price this year has soared to a staggering 150 taels of silver per dan, directly harming merchants and indirectly increasing the burden on patients. If this continues without intervention, it will negatively affect both commercial interests and society. With the year-end approaching, medicine shops will inevitably collect debts based on the unilaterally determined wholesale price of moutan bark. However, the National Medicine Industry Association is firmly opposed to the monopolistic behavior of the medicine shops. Therefore, the association, responding to the requests of its members, has scheduled an emergency meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss effective measures to address the monopolistic price of moutan bark by the medicine shops. According to a responsible person from the association, if the medicine shops do not change their monopolistic stance, the association will take further effective measures to counter them.</p>

<p>The Year-End Cooperative Painting Society, composed of famous painters in Shanghai, opened its exhibition yesterday at the New World Hotel. Over two hundred exquisite works are on display. Landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and animals are all rendered with divine skill, appearing lifelike. "Bian Zhuang Assassinating the Tiger," a collaboration between He Tianjian and Zhang Shanzi, is a perfect combination, worthy of being called a twin marvel, and has been purchased by Tang Songting. "Two Civets爭奪 Under the Crape Myrtle," a collaboration between Ma Wanli and Hu Dingcheng, is exquisitely detailed, and has been reserved by Liu Xinfu. Other works, such as "Three Friends of Winter" by Shang Shengbo, Ma Wanli, and Ye Weixin, are truly outstanding. Several monumental lion paintings by Xiong Songquan, with landscapes added by Wang Zhongshan, He Tianjian, Shen Jianzhi, Ye Weixin, and others, were quickly sold out. Those who came later all wanted to commission similar paintings. Fu Tiejun's orchids and bamboos, already famous in the art world, were reserved by Zhang Xinru. The landscapes co-created by Sun Xueni, Qian Shoutie, and Zheng Wuchang, the figure landscapes co-created by Shen Jianzhi and Tianjian, and the landscapes by Xueni, Tianjian, Zhongshan Xiaocun, and Ziyuan, are all exquisite works. Xie Gongzhan, Xiong Songquan, and Ma Wanli's large-scale plum, bamboo, and pine paintings are reasonably priced and exquisitely executed, with four or five people already commissioning similar paintings. Moreover, each painting is inscribed with poems by the poets Xie Yucen and Shen Jianzhi, earning them the reputation of being perfect combinations of poetry and painting, not inferior to Zheng Qian. Furthermore, Tianjian's "Green-Edged Landscape" and the collaborative screens by Shang Shengbo and Ye Weixiao are all difficult to acquire. The walls are adorned with treasures, leaving viewers overwhelmed, as if on a journey through Shanyin.</p>

<p>First, we must encourage all compatriots to not use foreign goods. The reason why our domestic products are not as good as foreign goods lies partly in the government's lack of emphasis on industrial development. However, the public's preference for foreign goods and their avoidance of domestic goods has an even greater impact. Even if domestic goods are not as good as foreign goods, if everyone uses them, manufacturers, in order to meet demand, will naturally strive to improve. Before the outbreak of the national crisis, only one domestic newspaper, produced by Tianzhang, was available. However, due to its poor quality, thick paper, and unclean color, the publishing industry did not use it. Consequently, Tianzhang's business soon failed miserably. After the boycott of Japanese goods last year, the publishing industry had no choice but to use it. As a result, Tianzhang's newspaper became popular again for a time. By the end of December, after only three months, Tianzhang's paper had improved greatly, becoming very thin and clean in color, indistinguishable from Western paper. This is because it received invisible support from customers. Therefore, in our opinion, to improve the manufacturing of domestic goods, we must first find a way to encourage all compatriots to not use foreign goods, thereby expanding the market for domestic goods. At that time, domestic manufacturers, in order to meet demand, will be able to greatly improve, catching up with foreign goods, like Tianzhang's newspaper. (C)</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, your newspaper's local news column published that our association participated in a citizen's assembly. We hereby inform you that our association has not participated in any group or meeting recently. We are submitting this letter specifically to request that you make a correction to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>The Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Binding Industry Union, January 22nd.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We recently read in your newspaper's local news column on the 22nd of this month that our association received an urgent letter from the Hainan Qiongzhou Student Union branch, stating that French warships have arrived at Yulin Port in Yaxian County and are landing troops, forcibly recruiting locals as guides to search the sea, creating a precarious situation. The authorities in Qiong are turning a blind eye. They hoped to appeal to the National Government and publish the original letter in the newspaper to draw the attention of the Chinese people. We have not received any such news. Where did your newspaper obtain this information? Or is someone falsely using our association's name to spread rumors? We hope you will make a correction to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Qiongya Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, January 22nd.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Today's newspaper carried an item titled "The Chunhua Rubber Factory Dispute Resolved," which we found very surprising. The fact is that in the case of the Chunhua factory engineer assaulting an apprentice, our association, out of humanitarian concerns, not only submitted a request to the Party and government authorities for investigation and handling but also hired a lawyer to prepare for legal action. Your newspaper stated that our association member He Penghui contacted Xu Haiquan, the factory's inspector, and proposed two conditions, stating that the factory had fully accepted them out of consideration for the apprentices. This is not true. Furthermore, Xu Haiquan and He Penghui only discussed the coal commission issue for the factory's long-term workers on the 21st, and they did not mention the abuse of apprentices. We are afraid that your newspaper's report is inaccurate. Therefore, we are writing this letter specifically to request that you make a correction to clarify the facts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Yesterday, we read a declaration from the Joint Federation of Trade Unions in your newspaper's news column, which included the name of the Soy Sauce Workers Union. Aside from our association, there are no other soy sauce worker organizations in this city with that name. However, our association did not send anyone to participate in the Joint Federation of Trade Unions beforehand, nor did we receive any notification. We fear that there may be misunderstandings in the outside world. Therefore, we are writing this letter specifically to request that you publish it in the "Letters" column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Walking down the street, opening your eyes to take a look, everywhere you see are things for eating, wearing, using, recreation, and entertainment. In terms of material enjoyment, everything is equipped for you meticulously and perfectly. There are dazzling department stores, extravagantly luxurious restaurants, tall Western-style hotels, bustling stages with gongs and drums, "refined entertainment" golf courses, openly gambling dog racing tracks and horse racing tracks, openly auctioned human flesh markets, dance halls, clubs, cinemas, teahouses, opium dens, gambling dens, and the "heaven and hell" worlds of ××. In short, in terms of eating, wearing, using, recreation, and entertainment, in Shanghai, you can say that you can have anything you want as long as you have a lot of money. Shanghai is pulling everyone down the road to ruin all day and night, constantly urging people to commit crimes and do evil. But when you have already fallen and become a so-called "scum" or "beggar," on the other hand, they have set up detention centers, prisons, or "foreign" jails for you. How meticulously equipped is Shanghai society!</p>
<p>However, here, you are only allowed to eat, wear, enjoy recreation, and entertainment, but you are not allowed to use your brain, you are not allowed to seek spiritual nourishment. If you don't believe me, in the vast Shanghai, you can only find one library attached to the Commercial Press, the Dongzhu Library. Can you find a second one?</p>
<p>I hear that London, Paris, New York, Tokyo, and every major city in the world has built large libraries, housing rich books for the people of the city to research and read. Perhaps this is the so-called "Western culture," and we Orientals should not learn the ways of foolish fools.</p>
<p>Every time I walk past × World and × Stage, I always have such a foolish thought in my heart: "When can this place be changed into a great and abundant library, and the people reading will still be so enthusiastic?"</p>

<p>The five-year-old boy was clever and quick-witted, and was very much loved by his uncle. He played with his uncle all day long.</p>
<p>One day, he liked his uncle's small foreign knife, so he took it to play with. Carelessly, he cut his finger, dripped a few drops of blood, and cried for a long time from the pain.</p>
<p>This day, his uncle took him to a slaughterhouse to watch the pigs being slaughtered. He found it very novel and watched the various actions with wide eyes.</p>
<p>First, a strong butcher went to the back of the shed and pulled out a fat pig whose four hooves were tied up. He grabbed its tail with one hand and loosened it with the other. The pig was just shouting madly and struggling. He put it on a wide bench, and an assistant came over to help and hold it down. He casually took the sharp knife from the meat cutting table and tapped it twice on its throat with the back of the knife, making a gesture. Then, the tip of the knife turned and stabbed straight in. It shouted even more frantically and convulsed all over. When he pulled the knife out, the blood followed the tip of the knife and poured straight into the bucket on the ground.······</p>
<p>"Wah······" the boy suddenly cried loudly and dodged behind his uncle's knees. "It hurts!" he shouted.</p>
<p>His uncle quickly picked him up and asked him what hurt. While crying, he turned around and pointed to the wide bench with his finger. At this time, the fat pig was completely silent and motionless. His uncle understood and comforted him, saying, "Don't be afraid." The butcher also laughed and said, "This child is too timid. If he saw someone being killed, I don't know how scared he would be!"</p>
<p>The boy continued to cry, shouting "It hurts!" His uncle had no choice but to take him back. His parents were startled by his appearance and heard him shouting pain. Later, when they knew the reason, they were relieved. The father said, "What hurts! Your hand is not cut, the pain is on the pig!" His tone was scolding. The mother said, "Good boy, don't cry. Tomorrow we will buy its meat to eat for you. It is killed for people to eat." A piece of loving heart overflowed in words.</p>
<p>The child seemed not to have heard anything. He just kept crying and shouting pain.</p>

<h3 id="e192">The Structure of the Light Bulb Ding Xi <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Fellow citizens! You live in this prosperous and lively city, and every night you see the electric lights on the streets, emitting brilliant light, much brighter than candles and kerosene lamps. Since you can see this good light, now you should know who invented this thing? What is its structure? If you don't know, please read this short article and you will understand.</p>
<p>In 1882, the American scientist Edison sealed a thin, white platinum wire in a glass bulb and applied electricity. When the current flowed, the platinum wire and the glass bulb were burned. At that time, he was very depressed because he could not think of a way to successfully manufacture the light bulb. However, he thought, "Nothing is difficult in the world, as long as you have the will." No matter what, he had to break through this difficulty and successfully manufacture the light bulb. He then experimented many times, using a pump to extract the air from the glass bulb, and then installing the platinum wire and applying electricity. It emitted brilliant light and could burn for a long time. At this time, the depression in his heart was relieved, and the light bulb was finally successfully manufactured.</p>
<p>Later, he thought that platinum wire was the most expensive metal in the world, several times more expensive than gold. Using it as a filament would not only limit sales in the future but also be too uneconomical. He began to re-improve it, using a kind of bamboo fiber, refining it into carbon filament, to replace the platinum wire. The results of the experiment showed that it was not only durable but also cheap. He then used this carbon filament to install in the light bulb.</p>
<p>Finally, he thought that although carbon filament was cheaper than platinum wire, the light emitted was not very bright and consumed a lot of electricity. So he again re-improved it and found that a kind of tungsten filament could be used to replace the carbon filament, which emitted strong light and was not expensive. Now this kind of tungsten filament bulb is popular in various countries.</p>
<p>The tungsten filament bulb is made of glass into a spherical shape, with a glass rod in the middle and a spiral continuous extremely fine tungsten filament. The two ends of the tungsten filament are connected to two thicker copper wires. One of these two copper wires is connected to the top of the bulb, and the other is connected to the side of the bulb. When lit, the current passes from one wire into the filament and out from the other wire. The resistance of tungsten filament is very large. When current passes through this conductor with large resistance, it turns into heat. When the heat reaches the extreme, it emits light.</p>
<p>Since tungsten filament has such a high temperature, why doesn't it burn out? This is because the air inside the bulb is extracted with a pump during manufacturing. There is no oxygen inside to support combustion, so the tungsten filament will not burn out due to heat. If we touch the outside of the light bulb with our hands, we only feel slightly warm. This is also because there is only sparse air inside the bulb, which transmits a small amount of heat, so our hands only feel slightly warm when we touch the bulb.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Selling a Son Bai Hong <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>It was just the morning after a cold north wind had swept through, and the weather was extraordinarily cold. We took a tram all the way to the target range in the park to attend a meeting with a friend. On the way back, Mr. C hurriedly said to me, "I saw it for the first time! I saw it for the first time! Did you guys see it?"</p>
<p>I listened, not knowing what he was talking about, and quickly asked him what was the matter. He said, "Someone is actually selling his son at the end of North Sichuan Road!" Then, he said intermittently: I heard it at first and didn't pay attention, so I walked past. When I got to the foreign school, I could still hear his miserable cries very clearly in the twilight and the cold wind. He was shouting, 'Selling children! Does anyone want children?' That kind of sharp cry was too miserable, I couldn't bear to hear it! I couldn't bear to hear it!"</p>
<p>This is really too miserable, there is actually such a thing as selling children in the world. I asked him what the face of the person selling the child looked like. He said, "He is a tall man from the North with a rough and dark face. He was wearing a blue cloth gown and shouting high and low. There was a woman in her thirties next to him, holding a child in her arms, and three were squatting on the ground."</p>
<p>After saying that, everyone said in unison, "Woe is us!" Then someone said, "This person is a fool, just squatting at the quiet and unmanned end of North Sichuan Road to shout and sell. I am afraid that even if he freezes to death, no one will give him money. If he was on the main street, he could earn a sum of money!"</p>
<p>A few days later, the person selling his son suddenly came to shout and sell near our residence at dusk! The trembling, miserable cries wafted hesitantly in the darkness, startling me. Mr. C quickly said, "It's this person, his cries are the same as last time." So everyone pooled some money and gave it to him. They talked to each other, saying, "Really, this person can make a fortune in Shanghai by selling his son. Who would really go and buy his child?" "However, his selling his child is always real. If I go to buy, can he not sell it to me?" One of them said.</p>
<p>"Really," I thought in my heart too. The next evening, the person selling his son came again. He was still crying miserably on the street as he did yesterday, but no one paid attention to him. He was using his son to beg for money.</p>
<p>A friend said, "Chinese people are so poor that they sell their children, they still blame their own fate. They don't resent anyone for their suffering, which is painful enough!"</p>

<h3 id="e194">Shop Assistants Are Also Embarrassing <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>One day I broke into the ×× general merchandise store to buy something. The name I called was different from the name they called, so the thing that the shop assistant took out was not the thing I wanted to buy. I said to him, "It's not this one, please change it for me," but what did he say to me? "When you come to buy things next time, you must ask clearly first. You said it wrong and you want me to change it. It will cost me so much effort… Anyway, the same thing is delicious, isn't it almost the same?" I was very determined that he had to change it for me, and he finally changed it for me, but he was still grumbling endlessly.</p>
<p>Another time, I walked past a French bakery and casually bent in to buy a few breads. I saw a compatriot wearing a short jacket buying things there before me. On the counter in front of him, there were three big bags of bread. Later, when he calculated the bill, he said it was so expensive? I don't want it anymore. As a result, he bought a bread for two hundred cash. When he was about to leave, what did that Frenchman in the store do, you know? He still put on a smile and said a very strong Thank you.</p>
<p>At this time, I couldn't help but feel a strong feeling. Opening a store and being a boss, what do you use your shop assistants for standing in the counter for? Of course, it is to be the boss's hands and feet, to bring business to the boss. In that case, the patrons who come, no matter how much they trade, are customers of the store and must be warmly received and should not be offended for no reason. This is the business strategy.</p>
<p>It's nothing difficult to change something that was bought wrong, what's the big deal about costing so much effort, and talking a lot of nonsense; this is really infuriating. At the same time, seeing how politely foreigners do business, they filled three big bags of bread, and when they heard him say he didn't want them, they took them back without a word (and they didn't not know how to speak Chinese, nor did they not know how to speak angry words). Doesn't he cost effort?</p>
<p>Shop assistants! Want to attract patrons? You shouldn't treat customers with this attitude. Don't you need patrons? Ask your boss, what did you put up the signboard, open the door, and use your shop assistants for? I am not willing to be a foreign slave and willing to say that foreigners are good, but this is the way things really are.</p>

<p>×The Battle of Mud City</p>
<p>Not long after the establishment of the Merchant Corps, conflict arose with the government troops. The Qing court specially appointed Ji'erhang'a, the Acting Provincial Surveillance Commissioner of Jiangsu, as the commander of the garrison at Xinzha. His command consisted of twenty to thirty thousand men. Ji'erhang'a was a Manchu and a civil official, originally ignorant of military affairs, but thought that commanding tens of thousands of troops would be an easy task. The Xinzha barracks were closely connected to the western end of the concession. A small number of soldiers sneaked into the concession, leading to minor conflicts with foreigners, which was expected. Soldiers also practiced shooting at targets to the west of the concession, with stray bullets occasionally hitting the area of today's racecourse and Xizang Road within the concession. Consequently, foreigners used this as an excuse to provoke the government troops. They initially demanded that General Ji'erhang'a move his camp to the south of the city, but Ji'erhang'a ignored them.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 4th, 1854 (the fourth year of Xianfeng), the British Consul Alcock sent a letter to Ji'erhang'a via Emerton, stating that the military camp at Xinzha must be moved by 4:00 PM. If the camp was not moved, they would attack with force. Ji'erhang'a replied, requesting that the matter of moving the camp be discussed at length and hoped that a dispute would not be hastily initiated. The foreigners then interpreted this reply as a rejection of their demand and, at 3:00 PM, summoned the Merchant Corps and foreign soldiers to gather in front of the British church, totaling 380 men. According to Captain Kelly of the American Plymouth, the circumstances of the foreign troops' assembly were recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Our troops landed at 3:00 PM, totaling seventy-five men. The British troops who landed numbered two hundred. The Merchant Corps was entirely composed of British citizens, so they joined forces with the British troops. The American expatriates brought two field guns under my command, increasing our troops to one hundred men. The British troops then increased to two hundred and fifty men, and thirty sailors from American merchant ships joined our ranks."</p>
<p>At that time, the British and American troops and volunteers numbered no more than three hundred and eighty men, commanded by Captain O'Callaghan of the Encounter and his deputy Dew leading the British troops. Wade (T.F. Made, the British Vice-Consul), previously a Lieutenant-Deputy, commanded the Merchant Corps, and Kelly commanded the American troops.</p>
