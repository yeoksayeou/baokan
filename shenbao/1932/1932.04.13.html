<p>時評</p>
<h3>如何救災彬</h3>
<p>昨論綏靖今請一言（如何救災）。</p>
<p>邇年以來。我國固無歲不災兵匪水旱蟲。疫種種之天災人禍。無不備歷。江南河北。荒凉一片。十八年西北大旱。赤地萬里。今猶未復。去年火災。更爲罕有之鉅刦。大地陸沉。慘絶人寰。二十年來吾人日處於災禍威脅之下。惟有仰首蒼天。聽命運之支配。政府旣不能弭災。抑且日努力於造災。吾人誠未知此次國難會議中所討論之救災。究何所指。意者或其着重於去歲之水災乎。</p>
<p>誠然。去歲之水災。爲我民族致命之鉅刦。就山東。河南。安徽。江蘇。湖北。湖南。江西。浙江八省而計算。總計受災耕地面積爲一四一·七（百萬畝）。受災農户數爲八·五七九（千户）。農産價值損失稻爲七五七·六八（百萬元），。棉爲爲五六·六○（百萬元）。高梁大米爲四二·二一（百萬元）。此猶爲僅就已有報告者而言若。綜合無報告各省區而計算。則數目字當更有驚人之鉅大。洪水所至。萬里汪洋。人畜田廬。同歸於盡。吾人迴想去年正當洪水方漲災黎忍死待命時之慘狀。猶爲之姜然欲淚。然而吾人試一檢救災之成績。則據救濟水災委員會之報告。截至去年二十年十二月底止。財務部共實收國幣七百七十九萬八千零九十二元八角八分。美金四十七萬一千二百六十四元六角七分。槪來自國内外私有以及團體之捐助。政府雖亦曾大聲疾呼。高唱救災。并以發行救濟火災公債八千萬事。引起立法院與財政部之斷斷争辯。然而除借購美麥外。賑欵究撥發若干。所謂第一期發行之三千萬水災公債。其作途如何迄今尚未見明白宣告。是則政府之於救濟水災。始終不過畫一不能充飢之大餅而已。當水災慘重時。政府之救災工作。亦不過畫餅。而謂今日水潦旣退。孑遺已差可挣扎其殘命。政府乃遍然夢醒。急謀救濟。四全大會。一中全會。二中全會。鄭重討論鄭重宣告之不足。復謀之於所謂代表民意之國難會議。似未免過於滑稽。國難會議討論之結果又如何。就吾人之推斷。充其量亦不過議而爲案。紀錄成文。再畫予災民以一不可充飢之大餅耳。旣不能積極弭災。復不能消極救災。徒日皇皇集議。甘言未惠。以欺騙災黎爲事。我人民固復何有於政府耶。</p>
<p>吾人認爲今日而言救災。應分治本治標兩道。治標有如粉飾裂痕。或募集欵項。或發行公債。或舉辦外國糧食。或移民開墾。此殆爲任何有所能言。吾人於水災方發時。亦旣已詳盡言之。至於治本之道。吾人認爲第一仍須澄清政治。蓋政治清明。而後内亂可以止息。兵禍不至復見。而建設始可着手。治運濬河。不至徒具虚名造林築堤。皆能見諸事實。抑且民得甦息。而後可以言提高民智。普及民衆教育。使其有力預防災變。脱捨政治而徒討論救災。是正所謂捨本逐末自欺欺人耳。彼堂堂集會。侃侃討論者。果能收絲毫之實效耶。</p>
<h3>停戰會議停頓後</h3>
<p>昨日僅開小組會議</p>
<p>毫無結果明日續開</p>
<p>停戰會議開會迄今、已達十四次、終因日方態度頑强、意見未能接近、毫無結果、現大會已無期延期、小組會雖連日討論、亦無結果、昨日午後又在英領署開小組會議、雙方僅討論日代表提出之浦東華軍一點、乃作空泛之争執、達二小時許、終未解决、結果、乃定於明晨十時再開、其他問題、均無暇談及、茲將昨日情形分誌于下、</p>
<p>昨日小組會議　昨日午後三時、續開軍事小組會、我方出席者仍爲黄强·郭德華、日方出席者田代·喜多·阿部·梶源·及英美意法各友邦參贊、昨日形勢、甚爲緊張、日方仍提出浦東南市之吾軍防地情形、并訊我軍須攻擊撤退時之日軍否、我國代表、因其言語無稽、不在基本條件内、故而加以辯駁、雙方對於問題、争論達二小餘時之久、卒未决定、復經友邦參贊之調停、於是遂於六時許散會、定於明日上午十時、再開會議、昨日毫無進展、空氣反趨惡劣、三小時之會議、僅增加一次空泛憤激之雄辯而已、</p>
<p>小組會議公報　昨公報云、軍事小組委員會、今日會議繼續討論在日軍撤退前中國軍隊駐紮地點、至六時散會、定星期四（即明日）再開、</p>
<p>吾方將發聲明　昨日下午三時、日當局曾邀日記者談話、對停戰會議、作片面單獨之非正式聲明、抺煞事實、謂停戰會議之停頓、完全爲華方代表意見不一致之故、華東社記者昨詢郭外次據氏談、此項聲明、尚未寓目、如果日方有此抺煞事實之聲明、吾方亦决定發表一聲明、將過去事實、昭示各界云、</p>
<p>日使片面聲明　據日人消息、日公使重光蔡、於昨日下午三時、在日使署招待日記者、報告此次停戰會議原由、其措詞略謂、此次與中國方面開會談判、係依據本年三月四日之國聯大會决議案·及與中國代表在三月十九日　議定之三項原則、自三月二十四日起至四月九日止、共開過大會十四次、其間關於撤兵中之小問題、均已解决、所未决定者、惟撤兵時期問題而已、至於此點、日代表曾於會議度上聲明、日兵來滬、完全爲暫時性質、并謂、中國代表雖明瞭此點、仍堅决欲日方確定最後日期、至日兵來滬目的、爲保護僑民、俟地方情形恢復原狀後、自當撤回本國、大會現雖停頓、然日方則仍準備單獨發表聲明書、希望於六個月内撤退完竣、至大會停頓原因、則爲中國方面之意云云、（國聞社按、三月十九日决定之三項原則、係專談軍事不涉政治、而地方秩序恢復問題、係屬政治問題、已軼出範圍、况日軍一日不撤退、即地方秩序一日不能恢復、至所謂出兵保僑、而事實上、尤足需明其效力、）</p>
<p>郭泰祺訪英使　斡旋中日和平最力主持中日停戰會議之駐華英國公使藍浦森氏、以停戰會議、雖召開十數次、終因無法挽回、以致會議暫告停頓、因鑒於在短期間内、尚不至開會、將定於本月十六日赴平、辦理使館積案、至何日返滬、則未知悉、聞藍使昨曾分函我國外交次長郭泰祺及日使重光蔡知照、郭次長接函後、於昨日下午五時半、赴英國領事館、訪謁英使藍溥森、對藍氏此次斡旋和平、表示感謝、談至六時一刻始返庽、據郭氏談、本日上午、接到英使來函、謂有要事、須赴平一行、本人當以此次停戰會議、藍氏周旋壇坫、煞費苦心、會議幾經破裂、亦賴其盡力調停、如此時恝然赴平、於談判前途、不無影響、吾人素來尊重藍氏之意旨、更盼其能完成調解之全功、故對藍氏茲行、至爲依依、今晚（即昨晚）特往訪謁、一再敦請其暫緩行程、藍氏已允加以考慮、此行之議、可望打銷云</p>
<p>美使謁郭泰祺　昨晨十時、美使詹森、赴勞利育路、謁我外次郭泰祺。詢問我國對於大會前途如何之表示、當經郭氏答云、連日會議、因日方態度之强硬、使我政府無法再行讓步、會議前途、已成僵局、華方實無法打破此難關、現惟有將迭次會議情形、報告國聯、以便由國聯作公平迅速之解决、美使聞言、并未表示意見、稍坐即興辭而去、</p>
<p>郭泰祺氏談話　昨晚日日社記者訪郭泰祺氏於庽次、問答如下、（問）我國對撤兵會議今後之態度如何、（答）停戰撤兵會議、因日方態度異常强硬、對撤兵期限、旣不允明確規定、必要地方情形恢復常態後、始允撤兵、又復要求我方軍隊不得駐紮於浦東、此兩者均涉及我國内政、顯係逾越討論之原則、我方絶難忍受、會談前途、殆成僵局、目前祇有將疊次會議情形、報告國聯、以打破此難關、（問）外傳會議已秘密簽定協定、此種謠傳、自屬無稽、先生亦有所聞否、（答）余辦理此次會議、自問無負於國人、此盡有事實可資覆按、本無庸再事其喋喋、外傳種種、實羣衆極度愛國心所激發、而作此過慮之測度、特本人愛國一念、素不後人、何至棄國家人民於不顧、幸告國人勿以爲慮、（問）日來反對上海設立自由市之説、甚囂塵上、先生以爲何如、（答）此説完全出自少數操縱商塲之外國人、及我國方面與商業經濟有關之一部份敗類相互聯成陣線而造此謠言、亦係彼輩理想之空中樓閣、會議中絶無一人提及此節也、</p>
<p>各團體請休會　各團體救國聯合會、於昨日下午三時、開第十一次理事會、由胡庶華主席、議决、定今日上午九時、推派代表李次山·胡厥文·貝祖翼·王造時·劉士熊·燕金·等六人、備函往謁停戰會議我國首席代表郭泰祺氏、請其正式宣告結束上海停戰會議、</p>
<p>國難救濟會電　中華民國國難救濟會致國際聯合會文電云、日内瓦中國代表顔惠慶博士轉國際聯合會特别委員會公鑒、吾國與日本、繼續協議撤兵、毫無效果、日本全然忽視特别委員會三月四日决議案、日本以狡詐行爲、佔據我軍自行停止敵對行爲以後退去之地、今竟公然拒絶議定撤兵日期、如日本不將其軍隊盡行撤入租界以内、恢復一月二十八夜以前狀態、决不能開會討論政治問題、在日本軍隊威嚇之下開會、必使日本激怒吾國全國國民、對彼之惡感、更爲增盛、英公使提議之調停辦法、吾國亦不能接受、時間過長、易生枝節、吾人熱誠向貴會請求、採取有效手段、以糾正日本藐視行爲、則不僅對吾國爲莫大之盡責、且足以保障國聯尊嚴及世界和平也、中華民國國難救濟會温宗堯等、</p>
<p>外人方面觀察　南京十二日專電云、某美人談、滬停戰會議停頓、華官方雖有交國聯解决之傳、恐事實上緩不濟急、因國聯本届會議事項尚多、中日問題、僅其一端、姑無論中國政府信賴國聯到若何程度、但國聯應付此事、手續繁重、以國聯調查團、須八月方能回日内瓦、故大會不能立即有所解决、勞將發還上海、仍由四國公使再行斡旋、重開會議、期於短期内、回復中日交戰以前狀態、説者謂經此波折、足以使雙方接近、而將停戰協定、先行成立之傾向云、</p>

<h3>閘北非法組織突爲日軍解散</h3>
<p>漢奸恶貫滿盈</p>
<p>日人欲蓋彌彰</p>
<p>漢奸胡立夫·汪度·常玉清·姚子都·李鵬飛·等於本月一日在暴日庇庇護之下、在閘北民立路六十六號組織非法之（上海北市人民地方維持會）以來、連日收集一般無業流氓、積極從事於蹂躪地方工作、詐欺威脅、肆無忌憚、北市人民、慘遭兵燹之餘、復受若輩茶毒、誠所謂禍不單行矣、日來益加横行、一般良民、竟視閘北爲畏途、罪惡滔天、報章騰載、友邦非議、輿論譁然、日人鑒於此種形勢之不佳、爲圖諉卸一切責任計、爲朦蔽國際視聽計、忽於前晚六時許、飭派少數日軍將該會迫令撤銷、並於昨日傳出取銷該會之原因、類多争權奪利之詞、解鈴繫鈴、世人當能洞燭其奸也、茲將當時解散情形、及日人故意傳出消息、詳述於后、尚望世界人士、勿爲日人所欺耳、</p>
<p>突傳解散令　前晚六時許、該漢奸等正在民立路僞會所内晚膳之際、忽來日軍總司令部武裝日軍六名、聲稱奉令前來解散該會、當時大小漢奸等、正在狼呑虎嚥、突聞變化、有如晴开霹靂、紛紛四散奔逃、抱頭鼠竄而出、頃刻之間、前後驕慢與頽喪情狀、大有哭笑不得之槪、若輩旣作鳥獸散、日軍即守立門首、禁止漢奸復入、</p>
<p>日軍掩飾詞　自該會被撤消之消息傳出後、社會揣測紛紜、莫衷一是、眞相究屬若何、局外人末由臆斷、昨日上午有人特往閘北新民路一零三六號日軍司令部第一大隊總部探詢眞相者、據負責某日人聲稱、日軍取消該會之原因、甚爲複雜、並逐一加以述明、然均係掩飾之詞、絶非由衷之論、特逐一照錄於次、</p>
<p>所稱六原因　該日人謂、其一·當日軍欲成立該會之時、係以維持地方、清净道路、勸導開市、及恢復交通等爲宗旨不料成立之後、該會反禁止人民自由出入、至於人民搬運傢具時、祇定有保護捐三厘、但該會不准預定章程、向人民任意敲詐勒索、其二·當該會未成立以前、日軍未允設立警務、而該會成立後、竟擅自設立警務科、委任警務長及偵探長偵緝員等、以及招募警士、以便日後獨主大權、而使地方深受其害、並使日軍毫無直接權利、其三·該會近日派出之各處男檢查員、每途遇美貎之女子、輒以檢查爲由、而乘機倭意調笑、因之日軍間接亦蒙受名譽上之損失、其四、該會成立以來、所有北市之一切公共及私家貨物、不問屬誰、竟擅自變賣、自飽私囊、日軍反分文無着、其五·日軍總司令部所發出之各項通行證、有時竟失其效用、而該會所簽發之通行證、反能通行無阻、關於此點、致使日軍之信譽及威權、完全掃地、其六·該會内容、與當日日軍總司令部所預定之命令、完全不同、且該會所有領袖人物、據事後調查、方悉若輩均係無智識之下流人物及流氓、關於此點日軍已認爲失策云、</p>
<p>市府仍通緝　據可靠方面消息、日人之解散閘北地方維持會、完全爲對外掩飾起見、表示其無領土野心、聞現正着手改組、以另一名義、組織傀儡機關、故漢奸胡立夫·常玉清·等仍在其卵翼下、照常活動、市政府昨據公安局報告後、仍飭屬加緊緝拿閘北漢奸、歸案嚴辦、不因日人此種掩耳盜鈴舉動、稍示寛縱云、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯十一日日内瓦電　瑞士代表馬泰繼吉白生起立發言、謂完全贊同美國提案、但希望將該提案予以擴大、大因吉白生曾聲明渠準備考慮其他提案、故馬泰認美國提案僅爲提案之開端、英代表西門亦贊同吉白生提案、又因美案僅指陸軍之攻擊軍械而言、故謂海軍及空軍之攻擊軍械、可從緩研究、西門並謂所採辦法、如欲發生實效、必使各國一律贊成然後可、旋向吉氏聲明、自現在起英國即完全贊助美國提案、德代表那多尼以主席漢德森之演説爲口實、起立聲明、大會所應進行者除制限軍備而外、尚須加以縮减、故應將吉白生提案與意大利提案合併討論、又稱、美國之見地與德國之意見甚爲適合、但德國所望於軍縮者尚不止此、故認美國提案僅係一種開端耳、法代表泰狄歐欲立即表明法國之觀點、請求發言、伊謂吉白生提案、法國極表同情、但法國之觀察更爲遠大、蓋美國提案僅限於陸戰軍械、而法國提案、並及於巨型鐵甲艦轟擊飛機及潛水艇等、且吉氏提案缺乏兩大要素、即對於違反諾言者之監察方法及制裁是也、所謂違反諾言者、即侵略者之别名、法國提案係就條約範圍立言者也、法國主張廢除巨型軍械而將其交於國聯會、作爲國際之用、法國誠知美國非國聯會會員、故不能越此階段、但美國提案僅及於陸軍之軍備、是使各類軍備互相牽連之學説、爲法國所主張而在軍縮籌備會席上通過者、歸於失敗、法國全國有陸海邊疆、又有本國及殖民之領土、故當主張此種學説也、泰氏最後謂法國代表團主張所有質地上裁减軍備之提案、均請匯交主席團、由該團决定研究之次序、簡言之、即彙集一切提案、視作一種整個提案、俾得按照一種方法而爲人人所先知者、合併討論之、至是主席漢德森答稱、渠之建議與泰狄歐之目的相同、即一切提案、先由主席團研究、而决定其討論之程序、意大利代表加巴勒洛將軍謂意大利以爲美國提案、必有更寛大者、美代表項所提出者不過其中之一部份耳、吉白生贊成將其提案移交主席團、泰狄歐對於此種提議認爲滿意、渠謂軍縮之根本問題、已經開始研究、法國以國聯盟約爲根據、而提出各議案、深爲榮幸、並謂適所提及之程序、應適用於同一目的之各提案云、主席宣稱明日十時再繼續討論、遂於六時五十分散會、</p>
<p>路透十二日日内瓦電　今日軍縮會議開會時、蘇俄久交委員李維諾夫提出軍縮之廓大計畫、李氏詢問與會各國是否準備將軍備大加减縮、雖屬一部分的、並謂如答語復爲（否）字、則軍縮會議已告失敗、或即終止、此固無庸隱諱者、李氏於是提議每。當籌計地理上之形勢、户口之多寡、邊界之長度、及其他各點、制定縮减各種軍隊之成數、渠主張凡有五萬陸軍者、當减百分之五、有十七萬者、當减百分之四十、而以此推類云、法總理泰狄歐復主張編設國際軍隊、歸國聯指揮、又謂今與會各國皆曾簽字於巴黎非戰公約者、皆贊助限制軍備之原則云、</p>

<h3>青雲歷刼記鄭逸梅</h3>
<p>一二八之事變。不佞乃躬歷其刦。蓋敝居在青雲路恒裕里。八字橋在其北。天通庵站及青雲橋在其東。械接肉搏至劇烈之區也。不佞偕荆人等脱險出。固未及携取篋笥什物。寄寓新閘路賡慶里六號友好家。望蘇州河北烽火連天。念及讀書偃息之敝居。中心爲之怔營不已。乃冒硝烟彈火。自後方繞至前線者凡四次。達案興路。輒爲軍士所阻。據云。倭卒密邇以守。見人行動。恐被作目標射擊也。十九路軍旣退。倭卒尚未敢深入。不佞得乘虚蹈隙。如丁令威之化鹤來歸。則門户洞開。已非舊狀。且頽垣碎瓦。在在碍足。登樓四察。晾衣之臺。僅存焦木。猶僵欹而立。西壁爲礮轟。開一巨賣。什物凌亂於地。衣服細軟。被掠一空。則皆地方宵小之所爲。非作戰之戎卒所得而防也。尤可惜者。則爲書籍報册。不佞收羅都數百千種。頗多孤本絶版。以搜索櫉具。散棄踐踏。無復完璧。不佞祇能付諸一軟。倭卒旣作鳩佔。戰事稍戢。不侫遂向工部局領得執證。雇車赴滬北。擬將被掠餘物。載之以出。不料適於其時。左鄰失火。右舍坍墻。不葬身其間。已屬萬幸。且餘物以越隔數日故。鼠竊狗盜。所剩僅十之二三。敗桌破凳。人棄我取。國破家亡。不勝慘痛。承朋儕探詢。爰草此文以告之。</p>
<h3>滬戰與軍器（七）一臧</h3>
<p>高射砲在歐洲大戰後。技術的改良。速度的增加。電力聯動的裝置。測量的準確已達至我們所期望的程度。還有一種極猛烈的砲。是裝載於特别搆造的鐵道砲架上。得以運生於鐵軌的。稱爲列車砲。常用以爲野戰與要塞戰以及移動於國境間的防禦。當一八二五年美。斯帝芬生Ｓtephenson發明蒸汽機關車後第二年。法。孟求利將軍Ｎonjury發明在機關車上裝置砲架。到了一八六○年美國南北大單。利用於戰塲。南美聯邦國政府。藉此砲進攻賓西發尼亞。Ｐennsylvania北軍連戰連敗。惟使用時因碍於軌道。且砲位的旋轉。還有種種不便。不能充分發揮其效力。後來經過了歐洲大戰。德國人傾力改良。竟收奇效。砲口的口徑。大抵爲二十糎至四十糎。可以射達三萬至五萬米突的遠距離。衝鋒陷陣。常常作爲先導的。</p>
<p>一九一六年法國人福奇翁褒伯雷。發明了電砲。超越用火藥以爲發射的效力。完全用電力。而使彈丸達於極遠的距離。因爲從前用火藥欲射達遠距離。應加大初速力。所以不得不使用多量的火藥。使砲腔内的温度與壓力。愈爲高大。因此極受制限。電砲依電塲與電流的相互作用。並利用線路汽車。可以自由得到電源。旣没有什麽制限。而且没有聲音。没有煙氣。增加極大的初速度。砲彈即能迅速射達遠地。今日各國正在鈎心鬥角。研究實用的方法。倘若試騐完成。則兵器界革命的進展。不可思議了。</p>
<h3>疑雲（一）程瞻廬</h3>
<p>京滬路上發生了障礙，卻造就了輪船老板的幸運，每次由蘇到滬的内河輪船，總是擠得不可開交；尤其是散艙中間的乘客，駢肩疊背排得緊緊的，宛如鞋子楦頭一般：排了一個，又是一個；只須有了一些空隙，便有人來鑽謀一席地，要是不依，他便硬把屁股做楦頭，非得排了下去不可，亂離時代的搭輪，不是搭輪，簡直呌做排楦。</p>
<p>幸而蘇滬的水程不遠，一天趕不到，兩天總得趕到的，要是有了十天八天的路程，受了長時期的肌肉壓迫和擠軋，只怕輪船抵岸以後，乘客都做了傷筋動骨的人；非得用帆布牀扛上河干不可，唉！這是誰給你們的痛苦，全船一致的都説，這是東洋赤老給我們的痛苦。</p>
<p>全船的論調，都是　美十九路軍的忠勇：而對於變更戰略，縮短陣線，大槪加以諒解和痛苦，漸漸談到江北人做漢奸，人人都是異常憤慨，駡了東洋赤老，又駡江北赤老，衆人裏面有一個身穿西裝的矮子，任憑衆人談的熱閙，他只默然無語；旣不駡東洋赤老，也不駡江北赤老；老是瞪着兩眼，向着人呆看不休体。</p>
<p>這便滃起衆人的方寸疑雲了，艷家不期然而然的向那矮子注意；見他，膚色的深度，面部的構造，似乎不是國貨而是東洋貨，最可怪的，右頰上面貼着一個膏藥，膏藥的反面，刋着一個小小的硃印，分明是蘇州××藥舖的牌號，在這分上便值得衆人研究；旣然貼着國貨的膏藥，那麽，這個矮子當然是國貨的矮子，不是舶來品的矮子了，然而，劣貨充作國貨，往往都貼着一紙國貨高標以便掩飾劣貨的成分，在這一點上，越是他面上貼着國貨的膏藥，越見得這矮子不是國貨的矮子，而是舶來品的矮子。</p>
<p>於是，船艙裏面，交頭接耳，竊竊思議：</p>
<p>丨這矮子形跡可欵，敢是敵人派來的奸細吧。</p>
<p>丨聽得敵方的奸細，異常活動；我們須得監視他，防範他　　丨是不是奸細，我們須得試騐他一下；但是，怎樣的試騐？可惜這裏没有檢查仇貨的委員！</p>
<p>檢查仇貨是很容易的，相傳的俗語，呌做，開口見喉嘴，提起尾巴見雌雄，我們和他敷衍一下子，賺他開口説幾句話，那麽是國貨，是仇貨，便可立時分明。</p>
<p>便有人向着矮子攀談，矮子老是不開口；一回兒搖頭，一回兒點頭，後來，和他講話的益發多了；他索性閉目養神了，似乎厭煩人家絮絮不休的模樣。</p>

<h3>國難會議的議决案</h3>
<p>— 金</p>
<p>國難會議，我本認定是政府之一幕滑稽而卸責的把戲·根本上原不贊同，後來政府又恐諸位國難會員不識相，討論到其他政治問題，與國家根本大計，便加上（綏靖）（救災）（禦侮）三種狹義的限制，政府的用意與手腕，益更瞭然。</p>
<p>原聘的會員五百餘人，茲到會者僅百餘人，不及三分之一，我想這三分之一的議員，欣欣而去，不知有些什麽高見，有些什麽遠慮鴻猷，我到要息心静氣，洗耳恭聽，乃昨據本報洛陽電訊，謂國難會已議决共同禦侮原則，他們的議决案是如此：</p>
<p>（一）共同禦侮案，議决·（甲）凡侵害國家政治獨立與領土行政完整之敵，政府應兼用武力與外交，抵抗到底，有違上述原則之條約，槪不得簽字·（乙）在政府努力實行上項原則時期内·全國人民，應不分黨派階級，盡其最大之力量，贊助政府，共同禦侮，</p>
<p>我謂政府應用武力與外交抵抗到底，這原是完全政府的職權·就不開國難會議，政府本來説長期抵抗·用不着諸會員再去説這樣官面的話·若説有違上述原則之條約，槪不得簽字·我試問倘然秘密簽字，諸會員有什麽辦法？又在政府實行上項原則時，全國人民應不分黨派階級，應盡最大之力量，贊助政府，共同禦侮云云·這原不僅在國難時期如此，即不在國難時期，亦應如此·但是全國人民，因不滿政府的舉動，分黨派，分階級，與政府爲難·試問諸議員有多大能力與最好方法，去消弭這種分化的局面？</p>
<p>（二）國難其中外交方針案，决議·積極聯絡主張正義，維持國聯盟約，九國公約，非戰公約之各友邦·以期獲得各國之同情，並鞏固太平洋之永久和平。</p>
<p>這一點，自從九一八東北事變發生以來，已有六月之久·這樣的工作，政府還不曾做過？政府還不曾想想到麽？因爲政府根本的不健全，與方法之不周密，事誠有之，若謂中國政府連這些智識多没有，直要到諸會員去指教，眞是還成什麽政府呢？但欲與日本外交上競争，看中國有人才否？有經濟否？有强固的政府爲後盾否？請問諸會員有什麽辦法？</p>
<p>我看了以上兩種的决議案，更認爲空洞而滑稽的一幕表演，完全没有意思，益自信我的觀察並不差誤，諸會員味口眞好，精神眞好，值得跑了數千百里的路程，去幹這樣的會議，議决這樣的原則，唉！</p>

<h3>滬難新樂府</h3>
<p>— 夢苕盦主</p>
<p>賃屋嘆</p>
<p>淞隅旣失江南危、人心搖搖將安歸、大家小户離鄕去、争向申江賃屋住、申江富兒屋作田、一屋歲收銀萬千、貧兒無錢那容處、祗借半樓蔽風雨、不知居停居何心、將屋作巢人比禽、敗屋兩幢十家賃、竈下餘地租多金、亂來屋價高倍昔、人多猶患屋難得、貧兒仰屋愁復愁、朝唶暮嘆租金逼、有錢且住無錢行、居停鐵面無留情、可憐江海淪烽燧、反爲居停致財地、祇知此邦安樂窩、誰料長安居不易、君不見戰區十家九無屋、足繭　江雨中哭、今能賃屋容起眠、日受困迫猶爲福、</p>
<p>埋遺骸</p>
<p>埋遺骸、遺骸狼藉滄江曲、面目如灰泥血攙、犬曁烏啄無完肉、屍林骨山撑亂麻、道旁髑髏生齒牙、日蒸氣發百毒泄、殘魂簸作風與沙、畢竟賊兵仁愛汝、一一和泥埋入土附身雖無衣與棺、猶勝邦人視無覩、戰塲昨過鷹撲入、斑斑戰跡痕猶新、夜來精靈哭江雨天陰月黑吹青燐、此際諸公夢方永、可惜不曾知此境、</p>
<p>近事書憤</p>
<p>斫地哀歌願總違、迴戈無力淚頻揮、九烏猖獗憑誰射、六鷁參差已退飛、豈有片言紛可解、但争一子局全非、諸公只辦秦庭哭、太息中原馬正肥、</p>
<h3>索夫團</h3>
<p>— 柱尊</p>
<p>日宼侵滬，被十九路軍痛擊，死亡甚衆，屍多投於大海，日本婦女爰有索夫團之組織，亦戰史中之一段佳話也，詩以紀之，</p>
<p>孤軍迎敵竟開關。白骨紛紛碧海間。添得蓬山新韵事。索夫團上望夫山。</p>
<h3>讌國聯調查團</h3>
<p>— 柱尊</p>
<p>國聯調查團到南京，某鉅公設宴，備有中國蠟燭七絃琴等，其夫人某女士竭誠招待，國聯調查團甚爲盡歡，各報多載其事，爰賦此詩以紀之，亦以見黨國要人之注意外交云爾，</p>
<p>豔妝紅燭酒頻斟。誰似將軍愛國深。却恐中華無與國。更教織指奏琴心。</p>
<h3>國難會議</h3>
<p>— 柱尊</p>
<p>幾載蕭牆苦弄兵。如何倭冦任横行。吾儕亡國寗今日。上帝無才管衆生。弱肉豈甘强者食。黨權不許小民平。紛來會議嗟何益。籠鳥應難自在鳴。</p>
<h3>漢奸</h3>
<p>— 柱尊</p>
<p>安得漢奸如此衆。爲叢驅雀不勝哀。六年黨。争皇帝。（蔣氏執政時，人號爲黨皇帝，實則黨國要人，人人皆欲作黨皇帝，數年内戰，皆國民黨同志之内戰，無非欲作黨皇帝也）·一百神州盡刦灰。滄海月明珠是淚。吴淞夜哭鬼成堆。從容京洛虚籌策。誰竟開門揖盜來。</p>

<h3>爆發性最强的火藥</h3>
<p>— 儲</p>
<p>爆發性最强的火藥，要算是硝基甘油C3H5(NO3)3了，取一滴硝基甘油在鐵鉆上衝擊一下，立即發生非常的爆鳴，當這個物質分解的時候，能受多量的氣體，而膨脹其容積，一個容積的硝基甘油，化做氣體時，能變做一千二百九十八容積，而這時發生的熱量，更膨大於空氣中，變爲一萬零三百八十四容積，所以硝基甘油比通常火藥有十百倍的猛力，故常用牠做極强盛的爆發藥，製造大量的硝基甘油，是用比重一·四七至一·四九的濃硝酸一容量，潢硫酸二容量，互相混和，把混的液七磅放在陶製的壺内，待冷却後，取比重一·二五的甘油一磅，緩緩的注入壺中，這時壺内的混液要發生温度，入攪拌時須很注意，待混液至華氏表八十度而不上昇時，便停止其攪拌，静止十五分鐘，把混液漸漸注入六咖㖮哈的冷水裏，那時就生成油樣的硝基甘油，而学降於壺底，這時用清水洗滌幾次，最後用鹼性的水洗滌，使去其殘餘的酸性，混入百分之一的養化鎂，就是製成的硝基甘油，可以應用了，</p>
<p>純焠的硝基甘油爲純白色，而通常則爲黄色或褐色的重液，有臭氣，味甘辛，比重爲一·六，有劇烈的爆發性和毒性，</p>
<p>爆發膠（Ｂlasting　Golatine（就是這硝基甘油的製造品，製造的方法，是取火綿一分，溶解於九分的硝基甘油中，這爆發膠可稱是第一種爆發猛烈的無烟火藥，牠的導火，是以爆裂銀十分之九和火綿十分之一混合，再混以少量的樟腦而成，</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>
<h3>一個傷兵的死（續）</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>（朋友！你好好的養吧，你的身體是我們中國的，你的生存對於我們是有重大的意義和呀！）</p>
<p>（不過，）：：他回答我説：（好弟弟，我的身體已不中用了，我一定會死的，：：：請你馬上代我寫封信回去：教我家裏好好的給我撫養小孩，：：大了給我報：：仇！：：）</p>
<p>（：：：：）我只能點首答允，在這時弟妹們不由的哭起來，儼如自已的母親快要死去一樣，</p>
<p>（那末我家的地址是廣東瓊崖北鎭：：）他再指着胸前的符號，（這是我：：的：：名：：字。）他的聲音，到最後簡直喘起來了。</p>
<p>不久，他再狂呌，他的眼睛用力怒視着旋復無力的閉上眼皮，他盲目的用手抓着空氣，瘋狂的，痙攀的。滿屋裏的人都對他注意，我想（啊！他快要死去了！於是我急忙喊着看護，救他趕快教醫生來，當醫生怱忙的來到的時候，他已全身無力轉入暫時的安静。忽然他再睁開眼來，眼淚延着面頰流出，嘴唇有用力的振動，汚穢的牙齒狰獰的露出，面色全染上一層濃重的暗穢·最後他努力喊出·</p>
<p>（復仇！：：殺！殺！）</p>
<p>不久，他的呼吸已微弱到最低限度，慢慢的便入於睡眠狀態，啊！就此死去了！</p>
<p>當我們走出醫院的時修，我已完全陷於量迷的狀態中，但是我的心情非常興奮，我不住的唸着：（他是死了，他已是戰死了，那末我們呢？我們當爲死難者復仇！）</p>
<h3>覺悟的她</h3>
<p>— 秀</p>
<p>滬變以來、閨中伴侣、多半星散，托庇租界的我，雖然僥倖無恙、但是暮雲春樹、眷懷同爲諸姊妹、流離失所、吉凶莫卜、使我愁腸百轉、而尤以情逾手足的瑛爲念、</p>
<p>昨天晚上、瑛忽做了不速之客、我歡喜極了、幾疑是夢、對着好細細的看了一回、使我驚異起來、因爲她從前那樣綺羅裏體的富貴氣象、竟一變而爲荆釵裙布的寒素家風了、我覺得好生奇怪、連忙問她、</p>
<p>（瑛、你家也受了日機之賜、一切的財産、都一掃而光嗎、）她搖頭説、</p>
<p>（不、我家幸於事變發生的前幾天、就離開上海了、）我説、</p>
<p>（那麽你以前許多花花綠綠的舶來品服裝、又到那裏去了呢、）她帶着媿悔的神氣説、</p>
<p>（唉、我自一二八滬變以來、受到極大的剌激的教訓、深深的覺得從前窮奢極侈的服用、不但太不經濟、而且金錢外溢、更是絶大的荒謬：：：）她喝了口茶又憤懣地説、</p>
<p>（區區三島、所以竟敢這樣的猖獗、無非恃其歷年經濟侵略的成績、造了許多猛烈的砲火、但是細想起來、這些猛烈的砲火、豈不是我們一般愛用舶來品的同胞們、間接予以金錢的資助嗎、一誤豈容再誤、所以我發誓不再穿用舶來品、况且在此國難時期、我們更應該臥薪嘗膽、刻苦砥礪的貫澈提倡國貨的主張、一絲一縷、都非國貨不用、纔可以塞漏巵、纔可以救這垂危的祖國、斷不要只靠着口頭的長期抵抗啊、）</p>
<p>我聽了瑛一席話、很欽佩她勇於改過、現在不揣謭陋、特地寫了出來、奉勸許多摩登姊妹們、快快覺悟吧、</p>

<p>上海市中之交通工具。屬於公衆普遍性者。除人力車及小車外。尚有電車及公共汽車兩項。電車創設已久。路線如綱。搭客稱便。故在上海車輛交通中。實佔一重要地位。上海電車公司之行駛電車始於一九零八年。最初與工部局訂立合同。其路線長二十四英里。每日自晨六時起至下午十時爲行車時間。該公司所獲之特許權原止於一九四零年咸以每七年一結。以定斷續與否。但須於六個月前相互知照。一九二四年雙言續訂第二條約。電車公司於行駛有軌電車外。更益以無軌電車。並於全數收入中抽百分之五。納税於工部局。一九三零年時。工部局之歲收中。增益此項税銀一一八·一一六兩。此外無軌電車於一車行英里中付銀二分。作爲整理道路之費。一九三零年此項收入爲三九·九七二兩。去年終上海電車公司所行駛之路線長三十五英里。其中半數爲無軌電車路線。該公司有電車及拖車二百零一輛。無軌電車九十八輛。一九三零年中車行之路程爲九·七零八·九三七英里。共計搭客一二八·五六四·九五五人·所付之車費爲四·○○○·○○○元·全部職工計二·七○○○八其中百分之九十八爲華人。</p>
<p>除上述之電車公司外。一九二四年又有中。公共汽車出現。該公司所納於工部局之税分兩種。一爲軟胎輪之一分半銀。一爲硬胎輪之一分又四分之三銀。均以每一車行英里計算。一九三○年。中國公共汽車公司所納於工部局之税銀計四九·三八九兩。所有車輛原祗二十輛。其後陸續添增至一百二十五輛。尚有定備車二十五輛。隨時可以僱用。目下其行程路線長四十五英里。一九三零年時。共行路程二·五○○·○○○英里。搭客數爲一三○·○○○·○○○人。全公司僱員近千人。</p>
<p>公共租界中現有之車輛。爲數殊可驚</p>
<h3>上圖爲美國别克汽車公司在福煦路亞爾培路口自建新屋之内景。一切規模之大。修理設便之全。堪稱上海最新式之汽車公司云</h3>

        <h1>1932.04.13</h1>
<h3>How to Save the Disasters of Bin</h3>
<p>Yesterday we discussed pacification, today let us discuss disaster relief (How to Save the Disasters).</p>
<p>In recent years, our country has consistently faced disasters every year, including war, bandits, floods, droughts, insect plagues, and epidemics. We have experienced all sorts of natural disasters and man-made calamities. The areas south of the Yangtze River and north of the Yellow River are desolate. The great drought in the Northwest in the eighteenth year left thousands of miles of barren land, which has yet to recover. Last year's fire was an exceptionally great calamity. The land sank, and the suffering was beyond human comprehension. For the past twenty years, we have lived under the threat of disasters, forced to look up to the heavens and submit to the dictates of fate. The government has not only failed to prevent disasters but has also actively contributed to them. We truly do not know what "disaster relief" means in the discussions of this National Crisis Conference. Perhaps it refers to the floods of last year?</p>
<p>Indeed, last year's floods were a devastating blow to our nation. Calculating only for the eight provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, the total area of affected cultivated land was 141.7 million mu, and the number of affected farming households was 8,579,000. The value of lost agricultural production for rice was 757.68 million yuan, cotton was 56.60 million yuan, and sorghum and millet were 42.21 million yuan. And this is only based on reported data. If we include unreported provinces and regions, the figures would be even more alarmingly large. The floods created vast oceans, and people, livestock, fields, and houses were all destroyed. We recall the horrific scenes of last year when the floods were raging and the disaster-stricken people were waiting to die. However, if we examine the achievements of disaster relief, the report from the Flood Relief Committee states that as of the end of December of the twentieth year, the Ministry of Finance had received a total of 7,798,092.88 yuan in national currency and 471,264.67 US dollars, all from private and group donations both domestically and abroad. Although the government has loudly proclaimed and advocated for disaster relief and initiated the issuance of 80 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, leading to heated debates between the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, apart from borrowing to purchase American wheat, how much relief money has actually been allocated? What is the purpose of the so-called first phase of the 30 million yuan in flood relief bonds? To this day, there has been no clear announcement. The government's disaster relief efforts have been nothing more than a painted cake that cannot satisfy hunger. When the flood disasters were severe, the government's disaster relief work was just empty promises. Now that the floods have receded, and the survivors can barely eke out a living, the government suddenly wakes up from its dream and rushes to provide relief. The Fourth Plenary Session, the First Central Committee Meeting, and the Second Central Committee Meeting have solemnly discussed and declared, but this is not enough, so they resort to the so-called National Crisis Conference representing public opinion. This seems overly farcical. What will be the result of the National Crisis Conference's discussions? In our estimation, at best, it will be discussed and recorded in writing, painting yet another cake for the disaster victims that cannot satisfy hunger. It cannot actively prevent disasters, nor can it passively provide relief. It merely assembles in a flurry, making empty promises, and deceiving the disaster-stricken people. What hope can our people have for the government?</p>
<p>We believe that today, when we talk about disaster relief, we should divide it into two approaches: addressing the root cause and addressing the symptoms. Addressing the symptoms is like patching up cracks, or raising funds, or issuing bonds, or importing foreign food, or resettling people to open up new land. Almost anyone can talk about these things. We have already discussed them in detail when the floods were raging. As for addressing the root cause, we believe that the first thing is still to purify politics. Only with clean politics can internal strife be stopped, can the ravages of war cease to be seen, and can construction begin. Dredging rivers and canals will not be mere empty words, and afforestation and building dikes can be realized. Moreover, only when the people can recover can we talk about improving their intelligence and popularizing public education, enabling them to effectively prevent disasters. Discussing disaster relief without addressing politics is truly putting the cart before the horse and deceiving oneself and others. Can these grand assemblies and eloquent discussions achieve even the slightest practical effect?</p>
<h3>After the Suspension of the Ceasefire Conference</h3>
<p>Only a subcommittee meeting was held yesterday</p>
<p>No results, to be continued tomorrow</p>
<p>The ceasefire conference has been held fourteen times to date. Ultimately, due to the stubborn attitude of the Japanese side, opinions could not be reconciled, and no results were achieved. The main conference has now been indefinitely postponed. Although the subcommittee has been discussing for days, there have been no results. Yesterday afternoon, another subcommittee meeting was held at the British Consulate. The two sides only discussed the one point raised by the Japanese representative regarding the Chinese forces in Pudong, engaging in empty arguments for about two hours, without resolving it. As a result, it was decided to reconvene at 10 a.m. tomorrow. There was no time to discuss other issues. The situation yesterday is recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>Subcommittee Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., the military subcommittee meeting continued. The Chinese representatives were still Huang Qiang and Guo Dehua. The Japanese representatives were Tadashi, Kita, Abe, Kajiwara, and consuls from the friendly nations of Britain, the United States, Italy, and France. The situation yesterday was very tense. The Japanese side continued to raise the issue of the defense situation of our army in Pudong and the Nanshi area, and inquired whether our army needed to attack and withdraw the Japanese army. The Chinese representatives, because their language was absurd and not within the basic conditions, refuted them. The two sides argued about the issue for more than two hours, and ultimately no decision was made. After the mediation of the consuls of the friendly nations, the meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m. and was scheduled to reconvene at 10 a.m. tomorrow. There was no progress yesterday, and the atmosphere became worse. The three-hour meeting only added another empty and indignant debate.</p>
<p>Subcommittee Meeting Communiqué</p>
<p>Yesterday's communiqué stated that the Military Subcommittee meeting continued to discuss the locations where Chinese troops would be stationed before the withdrawal of Japanese troops, and adjourned at 6 p.m., to reconvene on Thursday (i.e., tomorrow).</p>
<p>Our Side Will Issue a Statement</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., the Japanese authorities invited Japanese reporters to talk, making a unilateral and informal statement on the ceasefire conference, obliterating the facts, saying that the suspension of the ceasefire conference was entirely due to the inconsistency of opinions of the Chinese representatives. The reporter of the China Eastern News Agency asked Guo Wai about this statement, and he said that he had not yet seen it. If the Japanese side has this statement obliterating the facts, our side has also decided to issue a statement to show the past facts to all sectors.</p>
<p>Unilateral Statement by the Japanese Ambassador</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Cai hosted Japanese reporters at the Japanese Embassy at 3 p.m. yesterday, reporting the reasons for this ceasefire conference. His wording was roughly as follows: The meeting and negotiations with the Chinese side were based on the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on March 4 this year and the three principles agreed upon with the Chinese representatives on March 19. From March 24 to April 9, a total of 14 general meetings were held. In the meantime, the small problems concerning the withdrawal of troops have been resolved. The only unresolved issue is the timing of the withdrawal. As for this point, the Japanese representatives have stated at the meeting that the Japanese troops came to Shanghai entirely on a temporary basis, and said that although the Chinese representatives understood this point, they still insisted that the Japanese side determine the final date. As for the purpose of the Japanese troops coming to Shanghai, it was to protect the overseas Chinese. After the local situation returns to normal, they will naturally withdraw to their own country. Although the conference is currently suspended, the Japanese side is still preparing to issue a statement unilaterally, hoping to complete the withdrawal within six months. As for the reason for the suspension of the conference, it is the intention of the Chinese side. (National News Agency note: The three principles decided on March 19 only talked about military affairs and did not involve politics, and the issue of restoring local order is a political issue, which has exceeded the scope. Moreover, the local order cannot be restored one day if the Japanese troops do not withdraw. As for the so-called dispatch of troops to protect overseas Chinese, in fact, it is still necessary to clarify its effectiveness.)</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi Visits the British Ambassador</p>
<p>Sir Miles Lampson, the British Minister to China who has been most active in mediating peace between China and Japan and presiding over the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference, has decided that, although the ceasefire conference has been convened dozens of times, it has ultimately been impossible to salvage it, resulting in the conference being temporarily suspended. Because he believes that a meeting will not be held in the short term, he is scheduled to go to Ping on the 16th of this month to handle the backlog of cases at the embassy. It is unknown when he will return to Shanghai. It is heard that Ambassador Lampson sent letters to our Deputy Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Cai. After receiving the letter, Deputy Minister Guo went to the British Consulate at 5:30 p.m. yesterday to visit British Ambassador Lampson and expressed his gratitude for Lampson's mediation for peace. The talks ended at 6:15 p.m. According to Guo, he received a letter from the British Ambassador this morning, saying that there was an important matter and he needed to go to Ping. I thought that in this ceasefire conference, Lampson had worked hard to mediate and the conference had been broken many times, and it also relied on his efforts to mediate. If he goes to Ping at this time, it will inevitably affect the future of the negotiations. We have always respected Lampson's intentions, and we hope that he can complete the entire mediation, so we are very reluctant to see Lampson's trip, so we visited him last night (that is, last night) and repeatedly urged him to postpone his trip. Lampson has agreed to consider it, and it is hoped that the proposal for this trip will be cancelled.</p>
<p>The American Ambassador Visits Guo Taiqi</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, American Ambassador Johnson went to Laoli Yu Road to visit our Deputy Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and asked how our country felt about the future of the conference. Guo replied that the conference had been deadlocked because of the Japanese side's tough attitude, which made it impossible for our government to make any more concessions. The Chinese side was really unable to break this deadlock and was now only reporting the situation of the repeated meetings to the League of Nations so that the League of Nations could make a fair and speedy resolution. The American Ambassador did not express his opinion upon hearing this and left after sitting for a while.</p>
<p>Talks by Mr. Guo Taiqi</p>
<p>Last night, a reporter from the Japanese-Japanese News Agency interviewed Mr. Guo Taiqi at his residence. The questions and answers were as follows: (Question) What is our country's attitude towards the future of the troop withdrawal conference? (Answer) The ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference has been deadlocked due to the Japanese side's unusually tough attitude. They have neither been willing to clearly stipulate the deadline for troop withdrawal, nor have they allowed troop withdrawal until the local situation has returned to normal. They have also demanded that our troops not be stationed in Pudong. Both of these involve our country's internal affairs and are obviously beyond the principle of discussion. Our side will never tolerate this. The future of the talks is almost deadlocked. At present, we can only report the situation of the repeated meetings to the League of Nations in order to break this deadlock. (Question) It is rumored that an agreement has been secretly signed at the meeting. This kind of rumor is absurd. Have you heard of it, sir? (Answer) I have handled this meeting and asked myself not to be responsible to the people of the country. This is full of facts that can be reviewed. There is no need to talk about it again. The various rumors are actually aroused by the people's extreme patriotism, and they have made this excessive measure. In particular, my idea of loving the country is not inferior to others, how can I abandon the country and the people? Fortunately, I tell the people of the country not to worry about it. (Question) In recent days, the theory of opposing the establishment of a free city in Shanghai has been rampant. What do you think, sir? (Answer) This theory is completely from a few foreigners who manipulate the business community and a part of the scum related to commercial economy in our country who have formed a line with each other to create this rumor. It is also their ideal castle in the air. No one mentioned this in the meeting.</p>
<p>Various Groups Please Adjourn the Meeting</p>
<p>The National Salvation Joint Association of various groups held its eleventh council meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Hu Shuhua. It was resolved that at 9 a.m. today, representatives Li Cishan, Hu Juewen, Bei Zuyi, Wang Zaoshi, Liu Shixiong, and Yan Jin will be sent to visit Mr. Guo Taiqi, the chief representative of our country at the ceasefire conference, with a letter requesting him to formally announce the end of the Shanghai ceasefire conference.</p>
<p>National Disaster Relief Society Telegram</p>
<p>The National Disaster Relief Society of the Republic of China sent a telegram to the International Federation, saying that Dr. Yan Huijing, the Chinese representative in Geneva, had transferred to the special committee of the International Federation for consideration. Our country and Japan have continued to negotiate troop withdrawal, with no effect. Japan has completely ignored the special committee's resolution of March 4. Japan has occupied the land that our army has retreated from after unilaterally stopping hostilities by fraudulent means, and now publicly refuses to agree on a troop withdrawal date. If Japan does not withdraw all of its troops into the concession and restore the state before the night of January 28, it will not be possible to hold a meeting to discuss political issues. Holding a meeting under the threat of Japanese troops will only make the Japanese infuriate the national people of our country, and the evil feelings towards them will become even more intense. Our country cannot accept the mediation method proposed by the British Minister. The time is too long, and it is easy to cause incidents. We earnestly request your association to take effective measures to correct Japan's contemptuous behavior, which will not only be a great fulfillment of our responsibility to our country, but also be sufficient to safeguard the dignity of the League of Nations and world peace. Wen Zongyao and others of the National Disaster Relief Society of the Republic of China,</p>
<p>Foreigner's Observation</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Nanjing on the 12th stated that an American said that although there was a rumor that the Chinese official had handed over the Shanghai ceasefire meeting to the League of Nations for resolution, I am afraid that it will not help in time, because the League of Nations has many items on the agenda for this meeting, and the Sino-Japanese issue is only one end. Regardless of the degree to which the Chinese government trusts the League of Nations, the League of Nations has cumbersome procedures for dealing with this matter. The League of Nations investigation team will not be able to return to Geneva until August, so the General Assembly cannot immediately resolve it. Lao will return Shanghai, and the four ministers will re-mediate and reopen the meeting, hoping to restore the state before the Sino-Japanese war in the short term. It is said that this twist is enough to bring the two sides closer, and the tendency to form a ceasefire agreement in advance.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Blame Japan for the Suspension of Ceasefire Negotiations</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th, states that the Manchester Guardian published an editorial today on the breakdown of the Sino-Japanese talks in Shanghai, saying that the League of Nations' special committee of nineteen nations cannot easily avoid directly condemning Japan. The Manchester Guardian attributes the breakdown of the talks to Japan, because the strategy implemented by Japan does not conform to the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly, nor does it conform to the reasonable arrangements of the ceasefire.</p>
<h3>Yan Huijing Requests the League of Nations to Convene a Special Meeting</h3>
<p>Hoping to Hold a Meeting Before the End of This Week</p>
<p>Discuss Ways to Deal with the Shanghai and Manchuria Cases</p>
<p>Japan Publicly Praises and Aids the Puppet State</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Geneva, 12th, states that it was announced here this morning that Dr. Yan Huijing, the Chinese representative in Germany, had written to French Prime Minister Simmond, the chairman of the League of Nations General Assembly, requesting that the committee of nineteen nations, closely observing developments in the Far East, established by the League of Nations General Assembly, be convened immediately. According to this move, the Shanghai ceasefire negotiations fell into a deadlock due to the stubbornness of the Japanese side, so it is expected that Simmond will follow China's request and convene the committee meeting before the end of this week. At the same time, it is also learned that the Japanese government has recently sent a document to the League of Nations, reporting the recent developments in Shanghai and Manchuria, vigorously claiming that it is necessary to establish an autonomous government in Manchuria, and publicly declaring that Japan will do its best to assist the puppet state of Manchuria.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 12th, states that the committee of nineteen nations appointed by the League of Nations General Assembly to inspect the Sino-Japanese dispute will meet on Saturday, chaired by Simmond.</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Geneva, 11th, states that today, the Associated Press reporter exclusively obtained an unpublished draft document. This document was sent by the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations Council, explaining the general situation of the Sino-Japanese dispute from the Japanese standpoint, falsely accusing China of continuing to brew disturbances in the three northeastern provinces and advocating anti-Japanese sentiment in the headquarters, claiming that Japan is still stirring up disturbances in the three northeastern provinces, so Japan cannot but station troops in Manchuria at present. In addition, it publicly and clearly declared that the Japanese army will continue to cooperate with the new government (referring to the puppet state of Manchuria), because it is necessary to restore and maintain peace and order. People here attach great importance to this, which is the most extensive declaration of Japan's meaning on the use of troops in Manchuria in Geneva. Reuters, Nanjing, 12th, states that the Romanian Foreign Minister met with press representatives this afternoon to verify the report that the government had reported the Shanghai Sino-Japanese negotiations to the League of Nations, and said that the Special Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly would meet at the end of this week, and the government would carefully pay attention to its discussions. Dr. Gu Weijun has telegraphed the government that Lord Lytton has a firm attitude towards the Manchurian government's refusal to allow Gu to enter Manchuria, and has expressed his opinion that if Gu is indeed refused entry into Manchuria, the entire investigation team intends to return. The Romanian Foreign Minister also verified Reuters' Nanjing telegram of April 7, which stated that the government had shown the original text of the Sino-Japanese treaty of 1905 to the investigation team. The Romanian Foreign Minister also stated that the treaty did not state that China was not allowed to build railways parallel to the South Manchurian Railway, which proves that the Japanese remarks on this matter are all false. Reuters, Geneva, 12th, states that Japan sent a document to the Secretariat of the League of Nations today, stating that the policies set by the League of Nations Executive Council on September 30 and February 30 are completely in line with the policies that the Japanese government intends to implement in Manchuria. The document continued to describe the events after September 18, saying that Manchuria has always been different from the Chinese mainland in terms of history, economy, and politics. The change in the Manchurian government was actually due to the people's opposition to the military dictatorship imposed by Zhang Zuolin and his son, and wanted to see the establishment of a civilian government. The article also stated that the Chinese government has not yet contained the anti-Japanese movement and has a tendency to support it, so this movement is becoming more and more intense. The memorandum is very lengthy, and people in the League of Nations feel that its purpose is to try to save the League of Nations from implementing Article 15 of the Charter on the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>

The Kunshan County Party Headquarters and various mass organizations telegraphed the provincial government and the three civil and financial departments on the 12th, requesting them to send personnel to Kunshan to investigate the disaster situation and ask them to find ways to provide relief. Chongming established a Taicang refugee camp, which already has 2,000 people.

<h3>Britain Sends Notes to China and Japan</h3>
<p>Demanding Compensation for Losses of British Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th, states that External Affairs Undersecretary Eden declared in the Lower House today that notes have been sent to the Chinese and Japanese governments, stating that they must be responsible for compensating the losses suffered by British lives and property due to their troops. The British government will give careful consideration to the issue of providing assistance to compensation claims. Conservative Party member Miller asked whether an international committee would be established in order to negotiate in Shanghai, and Eden replied that he did not think this move was necessary at the moment.</p>
<h3>Taxpaying Chinese Association Issues Important Declaration</h3>
<p>The Responsibility for the Safety of the Concession Should Belong to China</p>
<p>Otherwise, it Will Be Similar to the Balkan Peninsula</p>
<p>The Idea of a Free City is an Illusion of Aggression</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association issued an important declaration based on the resolution of the representative meeting on April 11, as follows: In the past 88 years of the Shanghai Public Concession, those who have been related to it have believed that the destroyer of its safety must be our country's army, so the army of those who have been related to it has been invited to station troops, and the army of our country is not allowed to enter the concession, otherwise it will be disarmed. In fact, this kind of situation has long been considered by thoughtful political scholars to be extremely dangerous in terms of safety. The concession is not a country without sovereignty, but an area of our country's territory where friendly businessmen are allowed to reside. Strictly speaking, the responsibility for protecting safety should belong to our country, but with the prejudices of related countries in mind, and with the neutral state that has been accidentally obtained over the years, it is carved in stone and cannot be changed. In fact, the relationship between the related countries is by no means immutable, so conflicts of interest occur. If one of the related countries relies on its strong military strength, convenient transportation, and large number of overseas Chinese, it actually treats the land regulations of Yangjingbang as waste paper, and uses the so-called method of guaranteeing occupation to occupy all the municipal organs in the border and issue orders. Under these circumstances, the Bureau of Works is even more unable to resist. The defense forces of the related countries are not allowed to resist without the government's orders. If they have orders to act cheaply, the attitude between the related countries with goodwill is not necessarily consistent. Under the artillery fire, the entire territory will be reduced to ashes. Is this not a public concession that is actually similar to the Balkan Peninsula? Looking to the future, we cannot help but shudder. We believe that in order to prevent the prosperity created by Chinese and foreigners in the past 88 years from being destroyed again, and to have the hope of revival and progress, we can only let the sovereign country fulfill its duties as a modern independent country. As for the claim of a free city, it is simply an illusion of aggressors. The opposition of the United States is considered by the people of our country to be a legitimate and reasonable move. This is a special declaration, and those who are related to it are requested to take it into consideration. April 12, 21st year of the Republic of China,</p>
<h3>Sudden Dissolution of Illegal Organization in Zhabei by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>The Heinous Crimes of Traitors Reach Full Measure</p>
<p>The Japanese Attempt to Cover Up the Truth</p>
<p>Under the protection of the violent Japanese, traitors Hu Lifu, Wang Du, Chang Yuqing, Yao Zidu, Li Pengfei, and others organized the illegal (Shanghai Beishi People's Local Maintenance Association) at 66 Minli Road, Zhabei, on the 1st of this month.  For days, they gathered unemployed hooligans and actively engaged in trampling on local affairs, fraud, and threats, acting recklessly and without restraint. The people of Beishi, already suffering from the ravages of war, were further poisoned by these individuals. It was truly a case of misfortunes never coming singly.  Their increasingly rampant behavior has caused decent people to regard Zhabei as a perilous place. Their crimes were outrageous, reported in newspapers, criticized by friendly nations, and caused public uproar.  The Japanese, realizing the unfavorable nature of this situation, and in order to shirk all responsibility and to deceive international public opinion, suddenly ordered a small number of Japanese troops to force the dissolution of the association around 6 p.m. the night before.  Yesterday, they spread the reason for the association's cancellation, mostly using words of power struggles and infighting. He who tied the bell must untie it, and the world should be able to see through their deceit. The circumstances of the dissolution at the time, and the news deliberately spread by the Japanese, are described in detail below.  It is hoped that people around the world will not be deceived by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Sudden Announcement of Dissolution Order  Around 6 p.m. the night before, the traitors were having dinner in the pseudo-association on Minli Road when six armed Japanese soldiers from the Japanese Army Headquarters suddenly arrived, claiming to be under orders to dissolve the association. At that time, the big and small traitors were wolfing down their food when they suddenly heard the news, which was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky. They scattered and fled, scurrying away with their heads in their hands. In an instant, the contrast between their previous arrogance and their current dejected state was both laughable and pitiable.  As the group scattered like birds and beasts, the Japanese soldiers stood guard at the door, preventing the traitors from re-entering.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Covering-Up Explanation  After the news of the association's cancellation spread, society speculated about the matter, with varying opinions and no consensus. The truth of the matter remained unclear to outsiders.  Yesterday morning, someone specifically went to the headquarters of the First Battalion of the Japanese Army Headquarters at 1036 Xinmin Road, Zhabei, to inquire about the truth.  According to a Japanese person in charge, the reasons for the Japanese army's cancellation of the association were very complicated, and he explained them one by one. However, these were all covering-up explanations and not sincere arguments. They are recorded one by one below.</p>
<p>The So-Called Six Reasons  The Japanese person said: Firstly, when the Japanese army wanted to establish the association, it was intended to maintain local order, clean up the roads, encourage the resumption of business, and restore transportation. Unexpectedly, after its establishment, the association prohibited people from entering and leaving freely. As for the protection fee of 3% set for people moving furniture, the association did not follow the predetermined regulations and arbitrarily extorted and blackmailed the people. Secondly, before the association was established, the Japanese army did not allow the establishment of police affairs, but after the association was established, it secretly established a police department, appointed a police chief, detective chief, and detectives, and recruited police officers in order to independently control power in the future, which caused great harm to the local area and deprived the Japanese army of any direct rights. Thirdly, the male inspectors recently dispatched by the association to various places, whenever they encountered beautiful women, would use inspection as an excuse to flirt with them, causing the Japanese army to indirectly suffer a loss of reputation. Fourthly, since the establishment of the association, all public and private goods in Beishi, regardless of who they belonged to, were secretly sold off and used to fill their own pockets, while the Japanese army received not a single cent. Fifthly, the various passes issued by the Japanese Army Headquarters sometimes became ineffective, while the passes issued by the association could pass without hindrance. Regarding this point, the credibility and authority of the Japanese army were completely swept away. Sixthly, the content of the association was completely different from the orders predetermined by the Japanese Army Headquarters on that day. Moreover, after investigation, it was discovered that all the leading figures of the association were ignorant, low-class people and hooligans. The Japanese army has already recognized this point as a misjudgment, he said.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Still Issues Arrest Warrants  According to reliable sources, the Japanese's dissolution of the Zhabei Local Maintenance Association was entirely for external cover, to show that they have no territorial ambitions. It is heard that they are now starting to reorganize it under another name and organize a puppet organization. Therefore, traitors Hu Lifu, Chang Yuqing, etc. are still under their protection and are still active. The Municipal Government, after receiving a report from the Public Security Bureau yesterday, ordered its subordinates to intensify the arrest of Zhabei traitors and bring them to justice for severe punishment, and will not show any leniency because of this ear-covering action by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Japan's Foreign Trade Suffers Another Import Surplus in March</h3>
<p>A 96% Decrease in Central China</p>
<p>A 97% Decrease in Southern China</p>
<p>The Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office in Shanghai received a telegram from Tokyo on the 12th, stating that Japan's export trade in March totaled 100 million yen, and its import trade totaled 165.5 million yen, which was 4% less than the same month last year and 30% more imports. Therefore, the import surplus was 65.5 million yen. From January to March of this year, export trade totaled 258 million yen. Import trade in this quarter exceeded exports by 159 million yen compared to the same quarter last year, with imports increasing by 80 million yen and exports decreasing by 40 million yen. Therefore, the import surplus reached 123 million yen. The increase in the import surplus was due to the decrease in exports, and the decrease in goods exported to China was particularly large. In March of this year, trade with China saw a 6% decrease in imports and a 31% decrease in exports, a decrease of 14 million yen. Therefore, the import surplus was 6 million yen. From January to March of this year, the import surplus in trade with China has increased to 16 million yen. It is found that in March, Japanese goods exported to China decreased by 96% in Central China, 97% in Southern China, and 72% in Hong Kong, while imports to Manchuria increased by 72%.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Enforces Curfew Early Last Night</h3>

<h3>The Issue of Adding Chinese Members to the Land Commission of the Concession</h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association Asks the Municipal Government to Negotiate</p>
<p>And Authorizes the Municipal Council to Negotiate</p>
<p>According to the Yangjingbang Regulations, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has the right to freely acquire land within the concession for the construction of roads and public utilities at a given price. If any owner believes that the price is too low or is dissatisfied, the Land Commission will accept, hear, and decide on the matter. The organization of the commission consists of one person appointed by the Municipal Council, one person elected by the Western Ratepayers' Association, and one person elected by the Western property owners. Now, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, considering that this commission is closely related to the vital interests of our country's landlords, specifically asked the Municipal Government last year to negotiate the addition of two Chinese commissioners. At the same time, they sent a letter to the Municipal Council to negotiate the matter and follow the procedures for joining the board of directors. After consultation with relevant Chinese directors Yuan Ludeng and Xu Xinliu, and Chinese committee member Lin Kanghou, they obtained a suggestion from the Works Committee, and the Board of Directors decided to propose the addition of two Chinese commissioners at this year's Taxpayers' Annual Meeting. As for the election of the two commissioners, one will be from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association and one will be from the Real Estate Association. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association, after a resolution by the Representative Assembly, specially sent letters to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council yesterday. The original letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Government The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday to request further negotiation on the Land Commission matter, stating: We are writing to inform you that our association's Representative Assembly on April 11, following the opinions of the taxpayers, unanimously resolved to (request the Shanghai Municipal Government to negotiate again, and authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to promptly contact the relevant countries to add two Chinese commissioners to the council's Land Commission from this year onwards), etc. In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Council for their consideration, we are sending this letter to your esteemed government, requesting you to promptly negotiate the matter. We sincerely seek your cooperation.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Council The association also sent a letter to the Director-General of the Municipal Council of the Public Concession yesterday, regarding the addition of Land Commissioners, stating: We are writing to inform you that our association's Representative Assembly yesterday, following the opinions of the taxpayers, unanimously resolved to (repeatedly request the Shanghai Municipal Government to negotiate, and authorize the Municipal Council to promptly contact the relevant countries to add two Chinese commissioners to the council's Land Commission from this year onwards), etc. In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Government to negotiate the matter, we are sending this letter for your consideration and immediate action.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters Held a Commemoration Meeting for the Purge of the Party Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the Purge of the Party. The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city specifically convened representatives from all levels of party headquarters and various organizations and groups in this city at 10 a.m. to hold a commemoration meeting. More than 100 representatives from all walks of life attended. Chairman Tong Hangbai and master of ceremonies Xu Yefu performed the rituals. Then, the chairman reported on the history of the Purge of the Party, saying that in the narrow sense, the Purge of the Party seemed to specifically refer to the removal of communist party members. However, in the broad sense, all corrupt elements and those with wavering thoughts should be completely eliminated, so that the party organization can be sound. Next, Chen Kecheng and Zhou Peicheng gave speeches in succession, mostly encouraging comrades to continue the spirit of the Purge of the Party and strive for difficult work. The long speeches are not recorded. Then, they shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>Precautions in the Chinese and Concession Areas Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the Purge of the Party. The authorities in the Chinese and Concession areas of this city strengthened their precautions. The Municipal Public Security Bureau increased the number of double posts at all important road junctions in the early morning, checked suspicious people, and had police brigades, armed vehicles, and patrol teams patrol the streets. The British and French concessions also strengthened their precautions, it is said.</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng's Banquet In the Purge of the Party Movement in 1927, Yang Hu, Chen Qun, Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others were the main figures.

<h3>Various Groups Prepare to Receive Xiao Tuo's Elderly Mother</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce and Industry Will Raise Flags to Welcome Her on the Scheduled Date</p>
<p>The preparatory committee for commemorating Martyr Xiao Tuo, organized by the United Association of National Salvation Groups, held its first meeting at 517 Avenue Edward VII at 8 p.m. on the 11th. More than ten attendees, including Feng Shaoshan, Lu Xirong, and Yin Zhiling, elected Yin Zhiling as chairman and discussed matters related to the preparation for commemorating Xiao Tuo and welcoming Xiao Tuo's mother to Shanghai. The following was immediately resolved: (1) To additionally appoint Liu Zhan'en, Zhang Rongpu, Zhang Zilian, Chen Boquan, and He Yongwen as members of this committee. (2) To send a telegram to the Pacific Taihu Shipping Company expressing welcome to Xiao Tuo's mother. (3) To decide to use the Huaan Apartment on Jing'an Temple Road as the place to receive Xiao Tuo's mother. (4) To send a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Education, informing students and Boy Scouts from municipal schools to go to the New Customs Wharf on the morning of the 19th to welcome Xiao Tuo's mother. The original letter said: We are writing to inform you that American aviation captain Xiao Tuo died for our country in the war of resistance against Japan. All our compatriots should pay deep respect and condolences. We have confirmed that his mother will arrive in Shanghai from the United States on the 19th of this month. In addition to forming a preparatory committee to welcome Xiao's mother to China and to commemorate Xiao's heroic devotion, we are specifically writing to your bureau to notify all municipal school students and Boy Scouts in this city to assemble at 10 a.m. on the morning of that day and proceed to the New Customs Wharf on the Bund to greet her, to show condolences and express respect. We also hope that you will provide a list of the number of students from each school that will attend.

(6) The second preparatory meeting is scheduled to be held at the Central Society at 5 p.m. on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Li Denghui's Telegram to the National Crisis Conference</h3>
<p>Thorough Awareness of Political Transformation</p>
<p>Sincere Unity in Purchasing Aircraft and Warships</p>
<p>To the gentlemen of the National Crisis Conference,</p>
<p>The losses of lives and properties suffered by the people from the invasion of the brutal Japanese are incalculable. The wounds are deep and the scars are everywhere. In this time of national crisis, after careful consideration of the strategies for saving the nation, we realize that the arrival of foreign aggression is self-inflicted. The most important thing is to thoroughly awaken. (Omission) We wish that all people in the government and in the opposition can be awakened to repent and save on expenses, establish aviation schools everywhere to train aviation talents, and at the same time, purchase as many aircraft as possible to strengthen the air force. If each county takes the county as a unit and the county residents automatically purchase an aircraft, then there would be 1,750 aircraft nationwide, and we would have nothing to fear in defending against aggression. (Omission) As for the navy, if each province can take the province as a unit and exhaust the efforts of each province to build a 10,000-ton cruiser, then the country can have dozens of warships in five or six years, which can cooperate with the air force to defend the coast and there must be a guarantee. In addition to military affairs, the areas where political transformation should be carried out include: (1) Sincere unity. It has been more than half a year since the brutal Japanese invaded the eastern provinces, and it is difficult to predict whether the important people in Ning and Yue can truly cooperate. In my opinion, in the future, when there are disputes in the country, they should first resort to the arbitration mechanism of the national representative organization to avoid fighting each other. (2) Clean up officialdom. Selfish and corrupt officials who covet beautiful palaces, the service of wives and concubines, and personal gain often take advantage of opportunities and pass themselves off as revolutionaries, seeking only to enrich themselves. Although they have rich knowledge, they have no integrity. Therefore, to clean up officialdom, we must be cautious in selecting people and strictly audit accounts. When selecting and appointing personnel, it is better to rely on qualifications than on examinations. When auditing income and expenditure, we must hire accounting experts to prevent abuses. (3) Employ experts. What is learned is not what is used is a common problem in our country. Developing industry requires experts, and strengthening military equipment requires experts. The government should encourage scholars who are deeply committed to research, so that they can develop their strengths for national use. Rather than increasing the number of troops, it is better to train scientific military talents to strengthen national defense. In short, in these days when strong neighbors are pressing in and the wounds are deep, if the whole country continues to default on debts, then the country will perish. Denghui is unworthy of being appointed to the National Crisis Conference and humbly offers my humble opinions, hoping that the gentlemen of the country will examine them.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association Writes to the Municipal Council to Exempt the Patrol Tax North of the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>The issue of the Municipal General Tax (i.e., patrol tax) in the Public Concession of this city after the war has attracted much attention from all walks of life. The first representative meeting of the 10th Chinese Taxpayers' Association discussed the matter and specially wrote to the Director-General of the Municipal Council of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: We are writing to inform you that during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, shops and residents suffered heavy losses, and the area north of the Suzhou Creek suffered even more. Our association has written to your council, expressing the hope that the Municipal General Tax would be exempted to provide relief, but we have not seen your council's reply or any announcements, which is a matter of concern. Although business has resumed south of the Suzhou Creek, business is sluggish and unspeakable. It is conceivable that financial turnover is difficult. North of the Suzhou Creek, because the Japanese soldiers have not yet withdrawn, most shops cannot or dare not resume business, and their daily needs and requirements of the residents have been continued to be a problem. How can they pay the tax? Our association specifically submitted the matter to the Taxpayers' General Meeting on April 11 for discussion and detailed study. Everyone believed that the Municipal Council is the Municipal Council of the taxpayers, and all expenses of the council should be borne by the taxpayers. Everyone knows that the lives and properties of the taxpayers have been ravaged by the Japanese soldiers. The Municipal Council, because of its position and authority, has become such ravager, and you cannot not understand. At present, the economic capacity of the taxpayers has been difficult to bear the tax because of the destruction of the Japanese soldiers. The Municipal Council has also indirectly broken the budget because of the increased costs of emergency. Stalemate has been formed. It is impossible to escape the state of bankruptcy without planning from a long-term perspective. Therefore, there is common consensus (the Municipal General Tax north of Suzhou will be temporarily suspended, and the economic capacity of taxpayers should also be taken into account. The final decision and claim for damages shall be handled by the executive committee of this association), etc. We are writing to inform you, hoping you will examine it. If your council has a win-win situation for reference, we hope to do so.</p>
<h3>The Conference of Representatives of Merchants and Residents in the Hongkou District</h3>
<p>Declares That They Dare Not Rashly Resume Business</p>
<p>Forms a Committee to Discuss Rent Reduction</p>
<p>For important issues such as the resumption of business, rent, electricity, and tap water, the Hongkou District branches of the Citizens' United Association specifically held a conference of representatives at Dean Lane, Suzhou Road at 2 p.m. yesterday to discuss the procedures for implementation. Representatives from the Citizens' Association branches on Wuzhou Road, Jiaxing Road, Broadway Road, Hansbury Road, Yinxiang Port, East and West Huade Roads, Yangshupu, Haining Road, Suzhou Road, etc., including Zhang Xianfang, Zhou Fuzhang, Yu Yangsheng, Zhu Zhichun, Lin Yangzhi, Liu Zhongying, Zhu Baoluo, Qiu Jialiang, Wang Rongtang, Zheng Dongshan, and Xing Guxiang, etc., a total of more than 50 people, elected Xing Yuxiang as chairman and Zheng Dongshan as secretary. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, they began to discuss: (1) The issue of resuming business. The Hongkou area is under the influence of the Japanese army. If the Municipal Council does not provide a sufficient guarantee, merchants and residents in general dare not resume business rashly. The entire body agreed that (A) they should petition the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government to provide relief and maintenance measures as soon as possible. (B) They should issue a declaration. (C) They should send separate letters to the Taxpayers' Association and the City United Association to negotiate with the Municipal Council. (D) A letter should be sent to the Municipal Council, which should be responsible for guaranteeing the commercial market in the Hongkou district so that it can become a safe area. (2) The issue of rent reduction and exemption. Due to the special circumstances, separate rent exemption measures should be formulated. It was decided that (A) a rent reduction discussion committee for the Hongkou district should be formed. (B) Committee members should be nominated by the various branches. (C) Rent forms should be printed and distributed to be filled out for reference. (D) Representatives from the 5th, 6th, 7th, 10th, 15th, 19th, 29th, 30th, and 31st branches should be sent to the rent reduction movement. (3) The issue of tap water and electricity exemptions. Since the January 28th incident, telephones have been disconnected, and tap water usage has decreased. This is the case for every household in the Hongkou district, so exemptions should be granted to be fair. It was decided to send a letter to the City United Association to handle the negotiations. (4) The issue of electricity collection. The public concession used to collect electricity fees quarterly, but now they want to change to monthly collection, so the deposit cabinet should be returned for February, and the fees recently collected in the Hongkou area do not match the number of kilowatts used. These malpractices should be corrected to ensure accuracy. It was decided to send a letter to the power company to improve the measures, and to send a letter to the City United Association based on the situation of each branch to properly plan everything. (5) The issue of damage registration. The Hongkou district was ravaged by the Japanese army, and all kinds of damages, such as the loss of life and property of industrial and commercial households, should be universally registered as preparation for future negotiations. The damage committee has previously distributed forms and properly formulated registration measures. It was decided that the branches should urge all members to register and report.</p>
<h3>Land Commissioner Brooke Declines Candidacy</h3>
<p>In this year's annual meeting of foreign taxpayers, one land commissioner should be elected. There are a total of three candidates who have been nominated: Mr. J.W. Brooke, Mr. S.H. Peek, and Mr. H.G.F. Robinson. Recently, Mr. Brooke withdrew his candidacy on his own initiative. Therefore, Mr. Brooke will no longer participate in the election at the annual meeting.</p>

<h3>The Great Northern Telegraph Company Hosts a Banquet for All its Chinese Employees</h3>
<p>During the emergency of the Shanghai battles, the Chinese employees of the Great Northern Telegraph Company worked diligently as usual and carried out their duties perfectly, enabling the company to overcome various difficulties. Now that the company's telegraph services are gradually returning to normal, to reward its employees, a grand banquet was held at the Astor House Hotel last week. About two hundred and seventy Chinese and Western employees attended the banquet. Mr. Pengsen, the company's Far East General Manager, presided over the event. In the midst of the banquet, Mr. Pengsen rose and delivered a lengthy and highly interesting speech, which is translated and recorded below: (Gentlemen, the great and prosperous city of Shanghai has unfortunately suffered a very serious situation. This situation has caused tens of thousands of people to lose their lives, suffer disasters, destroy many families, lose much valuable property, and disrupt commercial finance. The most dangerous period has now passed. What the great international trading city of Shanghai needs is a spirit of friendship and pragmatism. If all parties concerned can show this to the fullest extent, then I believe that Shanghai can be restored to its original state. However, it will take many days to eliminate all traces of this military disaster. In terms of the special business that our company has experienced, the Shanghai-Songjiang cable has been completed, the temporary telegraph office in Wusong has been closed, and the Shanghai telegraph office has been restored to its original state. You are all aware of this. As the work gradually returns to normal, our company is eager to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all employees as soon as possible, because they have all been able to fulfill their duties and serve perfectly during this very difficult situation, enabling the international submarine telegraph communications between China and Shanghai and foreign countries to be maintained smoothly, especially in Shanghai. When the war was going on in February, the land cables between Shanghai and Songjiang were cut off. From a telegraphic point of view, the telegraphic communications between China and foreign countries, as well as the communications between Shanghai and North China, had experienced a serious situation. However, our company was able to overcome the difficulties and finally succeed. I am honored and pleased to report this to you. The success this time is due to the hard work and loyal cooperation of all employees and staff, from the highest to the lowest. When the company knew that the war in the Shanghai-Songjiang area might endanger the cables along the railway, it considered what methods could be used to minimize the hindrance to international submarine telegraph communications in the event that the cables were broken. The result of the consideration was to immediately prepare to set up a complete temporary telegraph office in Wusong, in order to use the submarine cables and jointly set up a temporary Shanghai-Songjiang submarine cable with other submarine cable companies in the Huangpu River, to replace the land cables in case they were blocked. Unexpectedly, the land cables between Wusong and Baoshan were affected by the fierce bombardment in the Wusong Fort area first, not the land cables between Wusong and Shanghai. Although this blockage did not directly hinder the company's submarine cable communications, it made it impossible to use the submarine cables that landed in Baoshan, including the submarine cables owned by the Chinese and Japanese governments. As a result, the huge increase in telegraph services caused by this extraordinary situation was all transferred to the company's lines for transmission. However, if the work in the Shanghai telegraph office could be maintained without interruption, it would only be a matter of increasing the efforts of the senior employees and staff. Two weeks later, the Shanghai-Songjiang land cables were also cut off due to the bombardment of Jiangwan, and we had to take active measures to open the Wusong temporary telegraph office. All parties concerned should receive the greatest credit for dealing with this situation. All the precise preparations for transporting the machines used in the telegraph office from Shanghai to Wusong were personally carried out by me in conjunction with the directors of all relevant departments. Fortunately, thanks to these preparations and the perfect service of all employees, the movement of the telegraph office machines did not encounter any difficulties. The work of placing the tables for the machines and arranging the submarine cables so that they could be implemented was carried out quickly and skillfully in order by the electricians and mechanics. As for the Wusong temporary telegraph office, it was properly organized by the director of the telegraph office and his assistants. As for the Chinese and Western employees of the telegraph office, even in unpleasant circumstances, they conscientiously carried out their machine work and did their best. The company deeply admires the feelings of the Chinese employees who were transferred to Wusong. You must have felt bored about the situation in Shanghai, and most of you must have been worried about the safety of your wives, children, and families in Shanghai. At that time, the fierce fighting was going on very close to Wusong, and the situation may have made you feel a little agitated, because sometimes you were working when the guns were firing outside the telegraph office. The company has done its best to supply accommodation, food, and other necessities from the beginning, but it is inevitable that you will have some discomfort or inconvenience. In the above-mentioned difficult circumstances, you have been able to do your best to carry out your perfect work, which is enough to prove your responsibility and loyalty to the company you serve, which is something that the company appreciates very much. It is also what the company hopes from all employees and staff, from the highest to the lowest. In this extraordinary situation, when the employees needed to increase their work, their responsibility and loyalty have been realized many times, so I am happy to describe it. Fortunately, our company in Wusong has not had any serious accidents, but I may as well tell you that I have considered the safety of the working staff there once or twice before, and ordered the (Si Nadisk) submarine cable ship to go to wait there, in case of emergency, and to send back the staff. The temporary measures taken by the company have cost a huge amount of money and the enthusiastic efforts of all employees. The purpose is to maintain the telegraphic communications between China and foreign countries, which is very important for the situation in China in times of special emergency, because at that time, the whole world was waiting for news about the development of the situation in Shanghai and near Shanghai. The company is very willing to serve the governments and societies of China and other countries. All of Shanghai and foreign countries have always expressed their deep trust in the company's handling of telegraph services. The company is very honored to be able to truly express this this time. I believe that all my colleagues must also see it this way. I have now learned from the representatives of various governments, the press, and other parties that they have expressed their deep appreciation for the company's perfect work in maintaining communications this time and for transmitting the unusually crowded telegraph services. Such many satisfactory expressions are enough to prove that the manpower used by the company in carrying out these temporary measures, as well as the huge amount of expenses incurred, are not in vain. The company then represented the company in expressing its admiration and gratitude to all Chinese and foreign employees, especially to the Chinese employees, and invited the Western employees present to stand up and raise their glasses to wish their Chinese colleagues good health. After the speech, the Western employees of the company raised their glasses to return the toast, and the joy and excitement were at their peak. Afterwards, Mr. Bai Qingyu, the representative of the Chinese employees, gave a brief reply. After the banquet, everyone took a photo to commemorate the event.</p>

The details of the process have been reported in this newspaper. However, the management's attitude is tough and the issue has not been resolved. The union, considering that this concerns the survival of all workers, has decided to do its best to resolve the situation. Here is a summary of yesterday's news:</p>
<p>General Assembly of the Shishi Xinbao Workers: After the news that the management of the Shishi Xinbao was unreasonably oppressing workers reached various newspaper workplaces, the workers of various newspapers were extremely indignant. Yesterday, all the workers of the Shishi Xinbao specially held a general assembly to discuss this matter. More than 300 people attended the meeting, chaired by Wang Wenbing and recorded by Ke Changsen. The proceedings of the meeting are briefly recorded below: (Report on the process) After the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, Zhang Baokang first reported on the situation of the incident, followed by Ding Zhengchang reporting on the negotiations by the executive committee, Wu Shengqing reporting on the negotiations by the special committee, Xie Zengtang representing the workers who were forced to leave the newspaper reporting on their recent plight, and finally Wang Changxing and Li Xiaoti giving impassioned speeches.

The original text is found and recorded below: (Omitted above) The capitalists used illegal suppression to seal off the workplace and arbitrarily arrest workers. Upon hearing the news, our association was extremely indignant. The workers of the newspaper have been helping the capitalists develop their business and working hard during the national crisis. Their hard work and great achievements have been publicly recognized by the society. However, the capitalists not only do not know how to show care, but also increase the amount of work, deliberately oppressing the workers. Their behavior is hateful and their intentions are punishable. Our associations are united like those in the same boat, and how can we stand idly by? Therefore, we respectfully lead all the workers in Pudong to pledge to be the backing. Our association has always been impressed by your efforts to relieve the workers' suffering. We hope that you will lead the workers of the newspaper with an indomitable spirit and work hard to fight. The final victory will belong to us.

<h3>The US Consular Court Opens Trial in the Crowley Opium Smuggling Case</h3>
<p>Testimony of Witness Meek Henry</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Pao [Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury] reports that the American Crowley was accused of smuggling opium privately from China and having the American navy transport ship Gammon carry it to the United States, etc. After being arrested at his home in the French Concession on January 9, the US Consular Court opened the trial this morning (12th). Consul General Pontius personally questioned him. Prosecutor Sales stated that Crowley contacted the American naval officer Meek Henry for some time, and then handed over 55 tins of opium, each tin containing three taels, to be taken to San Francisco. Later, Meek Henry was summoned to testify. Meek Henry was in charge of the transportation of military goods on the Gammon. After the incident, he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment by a military court. He was specially summoned to testify in this case. According to him, after the Gammon arrived in Shanghai in February last year, he first met Crowley at the bar of the Palace Hotel through a friend's introduction, and was later invited to Crowley's home for dinner. When the Gammon was in Shanghai, he met with Crowley about five or six times. On the night before leaving Shanghai, Crowley took out an iron can, according to him, which contained five taels of opium, and asked him to take it to the United States as a sample, and attached a corner of an old newspaper, with the name of the recipient written on it as a verification certificate when picking up the goods in San Francisco, and gave him ten US dollars as a reward. When he arrived in San Francisco, Meek Henry immediately called the recipient to pick up the goods, but he never came. He still brought back Crowley. In August, the ship came to Shanghai again and docked for a week. He met with Crowley six times, and all the conversations were about opium. On the night before the ship left Shanghai, he accompanied Crowley to buy six bottles of whiskey, and then went to Crowley's house to meet Crowley's wife and Mrs. Fang Deng. In the evening, Crowley led him upstairs to the bedroom, showed him a package containing 55 tins of opium, and Crowley smoked two pipes. He also tried one pipe. Late in the evening, Crowley, Crowley's wife, and Mrs. Fang Deng sent him back to the ship. Crowley took the package with him and went to the gangway. Crowley handed the package to him. He then went to the cabin with Mrs. Crowley and Mrs. Fang Deng. A few minutes later, the two ladies left the ship. He then placed the package in the cabin. When the ship arrived at Fort Mason in San Francisco Harbor, he heard that his cabin would be searched and secretly moved it to another officer's cabin. Then he re-packaged it and asked a servant to secretly move it to the ship's cargo hold. At this point in the interrogation, it was noon, and the interrogator announced the adjournment. The trial will resume at 2 PM.</p>

<h3>Japan Decides to Notify the Investigation Team to Guarantee Gu's Safety</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun Meets with Japanese Reporters</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to today's news, Japan cannot ask the puppet state of Manchukuo to retract its resolution to refuse Dr. Gu Weijun, a member of the League of Nations investigation team, entry. However, since Japan has temporarily assumed responsibility for maintaining peace and order in the three eastern provinces, the Japanese government has decided to notify the investigation team that if Dr. Gu accompanies the investigation team to the eastern provinces, Japan is willing to make every effort within its power to guarantee Dr. Gu's safety. A spokesperson for the Japanese government, when announcing this decision, said that for its own interests, Japan wants the investigation team to be able to investigate various situations on the spot. Since neither the League of Nations nor Japan has recognized the new state, Japan's allowing Dr. Gu to enter the three eastern provinces does not raise the issue of disrespecting the sovereignty of the puppet state of Manchukuo. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese representative Yoshida today received instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that regarding the matter of Gu Weijun and others going to the Northeast, efforts should be made to protect them to the fullest extent possible. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 12 noon today, Dr. Gu Weijun, the representative of our country, met with Japanese reporters at the Jiujiao Building. More than a dozen people attended, as well as one American reporter and several Chinese reporters. The questions and answers of Gu's conversation with the Japanese reporters are compiled as follows: (Japanese reporter asked) What is your attitude towards the telegram from Changchun, in which the so-called Manchukuo refuses Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun entry? (Gu replied) China, in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations Council of December 10th last year, appointed a representative to be a member of the investigation team, which is the same as the Japanese government's appointment of a representative to be a member. Both parties' members are part of the League of Nations investigation team. Therefore, Chairman Lord Lytton previously stated that any refusal of any member to go to Manchuria would be regarded as a refusal to the entire investigation team. (Question) Is the fact that the state of Manchukuo exists today known to the investigation team and Representative Gu? (Answer) China has not formally recognized the existence of the so-called Manchukuo. The telegram said to have been sent from Changchun to Nanjing has already been returned to its place of origin. The investigation team also does not recognize this political organization. The purpose of the investigation team is to investigate the entire situation in Manchuria, especially regarding the actions after September 18th of last year. The incidents that have occurred since September 18th, including the so-called Manchukuo, are all within the scope of the investigation. (Question) Representative Gu will resolutely go to Manchuria, regardless of foreseeable dangers? (Answer) Under any circumstances, it is necessary for the representative to accompany the team to Manchuria. Regarding the safety of the entire investigation team, as far as I know, the committee has already reported to the League of Nations. The League of Nations will naturally take appropriate measures regarding the safety of the members it has sent to the East. (Question) Since you do not recognize the existence of Manchukuo, in your opinion, should Japan be responsible for the safety of the investigation team? (Answer) China is not prepared to hold Japan responsible. How to take appropriate measures regarding the safety issue should be decided and implemented by the League of Nations. However, since Manchuria is a part of Chinese territory, if the League of Nations cannot devise appropriate measures, China will inevitably send a close escort when the entire investigation team enters Manchuria. (Question) According to rumors, this time, the Manchukuo's refusal of the Chinese representative is due to Japanese backing. What is your opinion? (Answer) I do not pay attention to the background of this action. Because the relationship between Japan and various activities in Manchuria will be thoroughly investigated by the investigation team. How will the investigation team enter Manchuria? (Answer) The investigation team will enter Manchuria by train. The team has full authority to get off the train and investigate wherever it wishes.

<h3>National Crisis Conference Cables the League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Requests Them to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The original text of the National Crisis Conference's telegram to the League of Nations Investigation Team (titles omitted): Gentlemen, because our country has suffered from the violent aggression of Japan, you have been entrusted with the important task of the League of Nations, uphold the intention of impartiality, make a detailed investigation, and come to China from afar, enduring the hardships of the journey. The people of our conference welcome and admire you immensely. Moreover, when you arrive in our country, it is precisely the time when our conference is gathering to discuss how to defend against foreign aggression. In addition to warmly welcoming you, the people of our conference have even more urgent expectations. For thousands of years, our country has always regarded "the world as a public entity" and "the great harmony of the world" as the highest goals of politics and education. We have strived for amity with all friendly nations. However, since modern times, Japan has disregarded international credibility, disrupted human peace, and infringed upon our country by every means possible. The facts are obvious and are known to you gentlemen and people all over the world. Recently, Japan has groundlessly and forcibly occupied our Northeast. Wherever the violent soldiers go, the villages and neighborhoods are reduced to ruins. Not satisfied with rape, plunder, and looting, they have advanced straight in, trampling on our Shanghai. The sound of artillery fire fills the sky, and blood flows all over the ground. All schools, libraries, printing houses, and all cultural institutions have been destroyed. The various cruelties have already been witnessed by you gentlemen. In order to defend ourselves, our country has no choice but to resist. We had no intention of going to war in the slightest, and we bear no responsibility for instigating conflict in the slightest. You gentlemen are about to personally visit the Northeast. Since the Northeast has suffered from the ravages of Japanese soldiers, a puppet state of Manchukuo, sponsored by the Japanese, has recently been discovered. In the ambition of the Japanese, they simply want to use the name of protecting the puppet government to achieve the reality of invading our country's territory. How can this kind of conspiracy cover the eyes and ears of the world? Our conference has now unanimously resolved to defend against foreign aggression together: (1) For an enemy country that infringes upon the political independence, territory, and administrative integrity of the state, the government should use both force and diplomacy to resist to the end. Treaties that violate the above principles must not be signed. (2) During the period when the government is striving to implement the above principles, the people of the whole country, regardless of party affiliation or class, should do their utmost to support the government and defend against foreign aggression together. The League of Nations is an international organization that upholds justice for the world, and you gentlemen should be messengers of human peace. We earnestly hope that you will base your reports on the facts to make clear the situation of Japanese violence to the world, so that justice and fairness can judge it. This would not only be fortunate for our country but also be a blessing for world peace. The entire membership of the National Crisis Conference respectfully bows.

<h3>Central Nanjing Office Holds Communist Party Purge Memorial</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Nanjing Office held a Communist Party Purge Memorial meeting on the morning of the 12th. Central Committee members Zhang Daofan, Cheng Tianfang, Xiao Zhongzhen, Xie Zuomin, and more than 600 representatives from staff and various agencies attended. Zhang Daofan presided over the meeting, and Xiao Zhongzhen reported, saying that the Communist Party Purge was the key to the later rise of our party. However, there is still an erroneous concept that our party lost its revolutionary power after the Communist Party Purge. It is not known that the Communist Party lacks in-depth research on revolutionary methods and loses faith in the people. The communists in Jiangxi and Fujian are all local unemployed farmers, and the real farmers and workers are unwilling to be deceived by them. Recently, there was also a farmers' self-defense army in Henan opposing the Communist Party. Moreover, the Communist Party's factions are complex, and the fact that they cannot control the military and show disunity and weakness everywhere. From this, it can be seen that if the Communist Party, which lacks theoretical methods and power, was not eliminated at that time, the harm to our party would have been profound. It is hoped that the comrades of our party will have self-confidence and the greatest determination to break through the current difficulties, continue the spirit of the Communist Party Purge, and carry it forward, and so on.

<h3>Disarmament Conference Reopens</h3>
<p>U.S. Representative Proposes Abolition of Cruel War Instruments</p>
<p>Russian Representative Advocates Thorough Reduction of Armaments</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 11th - The Disarmament Conference, which has been on recess for three weeks, reopened today. Chairman Henderson delivered a speech, expressing optimism that there is a firm agreement on the abolition of cruel war instruments and warships over 10,000 tons. Several countries also advocate the abolition of submarines, and the abolition of aerial attacks and germ warfare is also attracting attention. He felt that all parties are willing to reach an agreement on the above points. U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, Gibson, representing the United States, proposed the abolition of tanks, mobile heavy artillery, and poison gas and stated that he was prepared to postpone his proposal to abolish bombers.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 11th - Swiss representative Motta rose to speak after Gibson, saying that he fully agreed with the U.S. proposal but hoped to expand it because Gibson had stated that he was prepared to consider other proposals, so Motta believed that the U.S. proposal was only the beginning of a proposal. British representative Simon also agreed with Gibson's proposal, adding that since the U.S. proposal only referred to the offensive military equipment of the army, the offensive military equipment of the navy and air force could be studied later. Simon also said that if the measures adopted are to be effective, they must be unanimously approved by all countries. He then declared to Gibson that, from now on, Britain would fully support the U.S. proposal. German representative Nadolny, using Chairman Henderson's speech as an excuse, rose to declare that the conference should not only limit armaments but also reduce them. Therefore, the U.S. proposal should be discussed together with the Italian proposal. He also said that the U.S. view was very suitable for the German opinion, but Germany hoped for more from disarmament than just this, so it considered the U.S. proposal only a beginning. French representative Tardieu wanted to immediately express France's views and requested to speak. He said that France deeply sympathized with Gibson's proposal, but France's observation was more far-reaching. The U.S. proposal was limited to land warfare equipment, while the French proposal also included giant battleships, bombing aircraft, and submarines. Moreover, Gibson's proposal lacked two major elements: methods of monitoring and sanctioning those who violated their promises, that is, the alias of the aggressor. The French proposal was based on the scope of the treaty. France advocated abolishing giant military equipment and handing it over to the League of Nations for international use. France sincerely knew that the United States was not a member of the League of Nations, so it could not cross this stage. However, the U.S. proposal only concerned the army's armaments, which made the theory that various types of armaments are mutually implicated, which was advocated by France and passed at the Disarmament Preparatory Committee, failed. France has land and sea borders throughout the country, as well as domestic and colonial territories, so it should advocate this theory. Tardieu finally said that the French delegation advocated that all proposals for substantive arms reductions should be submitted to the presidium, which would decide the order of research. In short, all proposals should be collected and treated as a whole proposal, so that they can be discussed together in a way that is known to everyone in advance. At this point, Chairman Henderson replied that his suggestion was the same as Tardieu's purpose, that is, all proposals should first be studied by the presidium, which would decide the procedure for discussion. Italian representative General Gaberello said that Italy believed that the U.S. proposal must be more generous, and what the U.S. representative put forward was only a part of it. Gibson agreed to submit his proposal to the presidium. Tardieu was satisfied with this proposal. He said that the fundamental issue of disarmament had begun to be studied. France was honored to submit various proposals based on the League of Nations covenant and said that the procedures mentioned above should be applied to the various proposals for the same purpose. The chairman announced that the discussion would continue at 10:00 AM tomorrow and adjourned at 6:50 PM.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 12th - At today's Disarmament Conference, Soviet Russian delegate Litvinov proposed a comprehensive plan for disarmament. Litvinov asked whether the participating countries were prepared to greatly reduce armaments, even partially, and said that if the answer was "no," the Disarmament Conference had failed or would end. There was no need to hide this. Litvinov then proposed to formulate the percentage of reduction of various armies, considering the geographical situation, the number of households, the length of the border, and other points. He advocated that those with 50,000 army should be reduced by 5%, those with 170,000 should be reduced by 40%, and so on. French Prime Minister Tardieu also advocated the establishment of an international army under the command of the League of Nations and said that all the countries participating in the conference had signed the Paris Pact of Peace and supported the principle of limiting armaments.</p>
<h3>Franco-Japanese New Understanding on the Sino-Japanese Incident</h3>
<p>British Policy is the Key to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Paris News, according to French reporter Pandinan's inquiry, the recent meeting between the new Japanese ambassador to France, Nagaoka, and Tardieu was extremely important. Nagaoka explained Japan's attitude towards the League of Nations regarding the Sino-Japanese Incident. Tardieu indicated that France would not cause difficulties for Japan in Geneva. The attitude of the League of Nations in dealing with the Sino-Japanese Incident is difficult to predict, mainly due to British policy. Britain wants to liaise with the United States and is unwilling to separate from France. This attitude of Britain is more evident in the Sino-Japanese conflict than in the Danube Alliance issue. The only diplomatic dispute between Japan and France at present is the commercial treaty between Japan and Vietnam. This case was opened again on the 5th of this month, and an agreement is expected to be reached by the end of the month. (World Society)</p>
<h3>Major Eruption of Volcano in Argentina</h3>
<p>Mara Giant Town Collapses Completely</p>
<p>Earthquake and Thunder in the Capital of Chile</p>
<p>National Society, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 11th - Today, three volcanoes on the high peaks of the Andes Mountains erupted simultaneously. At the time, violent winds wreaked havoc, blowing rock ash across the country, even to Buenos Aires and Montevideo, Uruguay, which were shrouded in gray curtains. The rock ash accumulated in Mara Giant Town on the border has reached a depth of 16 inches, and residents are preparing to evacuate. At the same time, there were earthquakes and thunder in the capital of Chile, and people were extremely panicked.</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 12th - Residents in the volcanic area of ​​Argentina and Chile heard rumbling sounds from the ground all night, and they were terrified and unable to sleep. Mara Giant Town in Mendoza Province, Argentina, collapsed completely due to land collapse, and volcanic ash covered it. It is estimated that the area is as large as England. The smell is suffocating. The latest urgent telegram from Mara asks for bottled oxygen to be transported quickly and to send people to rescue the victims. It is said that there are ash and sulfur gas in the air in several places, so the air cannot be breathed. Argentine astronomer Gill drew people's attention to the simultaneous discovery of sunspots and electromagnetic disturbances and believed that the ash from the ground was ejected to a height of five miles due to internal pressure, so its fall was like a shower.</p>

<h3>Stimson Pays Attention to the Eastern Problem</h3>
<p>The Main Reason for Going to Europe</p>
<p>Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun says, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, who recently departed from the United States for Europe, will exchange views with European politicians on the disputes over the Eastern Problem and persuade them to respect the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact in order to maintain the spirit of the treaty jointly. However, the Eastern Problem is not directly related to the Disarmament Conference. However, in Stimson's letter to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Borah, he said that various treaties concerning the East have a close relationship with the naval problem in the Pacific, so Stimson extremely hopes for the attention of European diplomatic circles. It is said that after going to Europe, Stimson will still have to go to England to make contact.</p>
<h3>Records of the League of Nations Investigation Team's Visit to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Two-Hour Conversation with a Northeast Elder</p>
<p>Inquiries Among the Public Regarding Puyi's Forced Passage</p>
<p>Clearing Streets on Dajing Road in Hebei and in the Japanese Concession</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 9th, receiving a warm welcome from the public. At 10:00 AM, they met with representatives from various sectors at the West Lake Hotel. At noon, they attended a public banquet hosted by the provincial government. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, they boarded a train to Ping (Beiping). Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Preparations for the Welcome: After the Investigation Team arrived in Shanghai, preparations for a welcoming organization were immediately considered. Learning that the team would not disembark was a great relief, as it would avoid a lot of trouble. It was then planned to erect arches and paste slogans at both the East and General Stations to express welcome only. However, the public was greatly dissatisfied. Consequently, Zhang Boling, Bian Baimei, Huang Zongfa, and others sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, forwarding it to the Investigation Team, stating roughly that since the Japanese army occupied the three northeastern provinces, two incidents had occurred in Tianjin, which were related to the Japanese army's occupation of the Northeast. The million people of Tianjin eagerly hoped that the Investigation Team would disembark in Tianjin for inspection. Shortly after, a reply telegram was received, agreeing to a one- or two-day stay in Tianjin. Thereupon, the provincial and municipal governments felt rushed, convening party and government officials and leaders from various sectors to organize a preparatory office for welcoming the League of Nations Investigation Team. During the first preparatory meeting, the opinions of the Party and the government differed greatly. The Party stated that if there was no welcome, so be it, but if a welcome was desired, the scope should be expanded; otherwise, it would not adequately express public sentiment. Therefore, according to the Party's plan, ten thousand members of the public should be gathered, lining the route from the General Station to the southeast corner of the city (the north entrance of Asahi Street in the Japanese Concession), electing a general representative to submit a petition. The public participating in the welcome would be responsible for their respective sectors and groups, with military police and secret agents conducting surveillance in the background, ensuring that order would not be disrupted. The provincial and municipal governments were apprehensive, fearing concerns about public safety, stating that the welcoming representatives must be strictly limited, with the number not exceeding five hundred. Representatives from various sectors were in an uproar upon hearing this, saying that it would be unsightly to have only four or five hundred people welcoming the Investigation Team at such a large city as Tianjin. So it was changed to one thousand people, and during the second preparatory meeting, it was changed to two thousand. Public groups still felt that the number was too small and changed it to four thousand. Moreover, because a telegram was received from Nanjing stating that the Investigation Team had changed its itinerary and would only stay in Tianjin for half a day, it was decided to hold a public banquet at the provincial government at noon on that day, and to receive representatives at the West Lake Hotel once, canceling the tea party. At 3:00 PM on the seventh, the final preparatory meeting was held in the municipal government auditorium, further strictly limiting the number of welcomers and distributing welcome badges: 240 from the labor sector, 200 from the business sector, 200 from the education sector, 30 from the women's sector, 12 from the legal sector, and the number from the press, originally limited to 50, was changed to 80 after much arguing because it was insufficient for distribution; 80 from the autonomous region, and 200 from the party and government sector, totaling 1,042 people, a reduction of two-thirds compared to the original 4,000. One or two general representatives were selected from each sector for liaison upon boarding the train, but in reality, they were not selected by the sectors themselves, but rather assigned by the preparatory office, so the names were not announced in advance. However, there were repercussions. The issue of flags also caused disputes. Originally, the preparatory office decided not to use flags to save expenses, but most people were dissatisfied with this, because the thousand-plus representatives who went to the station to welcome the team included people from all sectors - party, government, military, police, gentry, merchants, and scholars. Without flags for identification, wouldn't it be a disorganized mob? As a result of the debate, the preparatory office went to create white cloth banners with both Chinese and English text to ensure uniformity. In addition, the materials offered to the Investigation Team had already been sent to Beiping. Now only a book of photos of the Tianjin Incident remained. Someone suggested drawing a map of the Tianjin Incident, marking the locations where the plainclothes team was based, where they attacked, and where they retreated, so that the ironclad evidence of the Japanese concession authorities' support for the plainclothes team would leap off the page, leaving no room for escape. Someone also suggested inviting the Investigation Team to inspect the remains of the Japanese army's shelling of Chinese territory, but neither proposal was adopted by the preparatory committee. The only somewhat satisfactory matter was the letter from the All-Circles National Salvation Joint Association to the Investigation Team, which described the parties responsible for the Tianjin Incident in great detail, signed by more than 1,500 well-known figures from all sectors. In addition, public representatives Zhang Boling, Bian Baimei, and others prepared several questions to ask the Investigation Team face-to-face.</p>
<p>Situation After Arrival in Tianjin: Provincial Chairman Wang Shuchang had already sent Huang Zongfa to Jinan on the 7th to meet the special train and ordered all counties and garrisons along the route to protect the train carefully. In addition to sending armored train commander Cao Yaozhang to Dezhou on an armored train to meet the team, the Beiping Pacification Headquarters also sent Gao Jiyi, Shen Zutong, and Ning Xiangnan to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 8th to welcome them. Both the East Station and the General Station were painted and cleaned, each with a colorful archway, several stories high, which was exceptionally beautiful. Lines were drawn on the platform to prevent the representatives from various sectors from becoming disorganized. National flags were hung all over the platform, along with colorful electric lights. A white cloth banner was suspended over the bridge crossing the platform, reading "Welcome the Peace Envoys, the League of Nations Investigation Team." There were also Chinese and English slogans from the Beining Railway Special Party Branch and the Beining Railway Trade Union, reading "The Chinese People Would Rather Die for Justice Than Submit to Coercion; the Chinese People Will Never Accept Conditions That Surrender Our Rights and Humiliate Our Country; the Chinese People Would Rather Be Shattered Jade Than Intact Tile." On the morning of the 9th, starting around 7:00 AM, representatives from various sectors gathered one after another at the General Station. In addition to the police and military police suppressing the ground, there were 300 Boy Scouts maintaining order. Liu Jialuan, Chief of Staff of the Second Army, and Wang Yimin, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, were the general and deputy commanders of the military and political agencies. Shao Hua, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, was the general commander of the public groups. At 8:30 AM, the Investigation Team's special train had passed Yangliuqing, only thirty miles from Tianjin. The Municipal Government then sent section chief Shen Dijia to the West Station to express welcome. At 9:00 AM, the special train entered the station amidst the melodious sound of military music. After the train stopped, Miss Shaofen, daughter of the late President Li Yuanhong, first boarded the train to present flowers on behalf of the entire Tianjin public. Next, Provincial Chairman Wang Shuchang, Mayor Zhou Longguang, and representatives from various sectors such as Zhang Boling, Bian Baimei, and Hu Zhengzhi boarded the train to welcome them, exchanged a few words, then disembarked and left the station, accompanied by receptionists to their cars. They were divided into two groups, one group sending the Investigation Committee to the West Lake Hotel, and the other sending the Chinese representatives and attendants to the Heshunde Hotel. British representative Sir Lytton was hosted by Chinese representative Gu Weijun. German representative Dr. Schnee was hosted by Duan Maolan. French representative General Claudel was hosted by Shen Dijia. Italian representative Count Aldrovandi was hosted by Tao Jian. American representative Major General McCoy was hosted by Zhang Rui. At 10:00 AM, the Investigation Team first met with people from the Northeast Tianjin Fellow Association, including three Northeast elders, who described the situation of the Northeast Incident. The Investigation Committee members attached great importance to this, and the conversation lasted for two hours, facilitated by Huang Zongfa. They then met with the consuls and military attachés of various countries stationed in Tianjin, talking for about ten minutes. After that, they met with public representatives Zhang Boling, Bian Baimei, Hu Zhengzhi, Zhang Pinting, Wang Wendian, and Li Shaofen, presenting their written opinions, after which they talked for about ten minutes. They inquired about Puyi being forced to go to Liaoning and the situation of the Tianjin Incident. By then it was already 12:30 PM. They were unable to meet with the press and went to the provincial government for a public banquet. Wang Shuchang gave a welcoming speech, roughly saying, "The Chinese nation has always loved peace. The League of Nations is an organization for maintaining world peace. Now, because of the Sino-Japanese incident, it has sent representatives from various countries across the oceans to investigate the truth so that fair sanctions can be made and a peaceful solution can be found. Today, the Investigation Team visits Tianjin, representing the 30 million people of Hebei Province, offering our sincerest welcome and wishing for lasting world peace." British representative Lytton replied, roughly saying, "Our team has been commissioned by the League of Nations to come to the Far East to investigate the Sino-Japanese dispute, with the aim of ensuring that justice and peace are permanently guaranteed. Our team has been warmly welcomed in both Japan and China, but I feel that it is not our five members who are being welcomed, but the League of Nations, which maintains world peace. Having come to China from Japan, we have heard and seen a lot and obtained a great deal of material. Soon we will go to our final destination, the Northeast, and once the investigation is complete, we will submit a comprehensive report to the League of Nations. I believe the League of Nations will find a fair and peaceful method to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute." The banquet ended around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and at 3:00 PM, they boarded the train to Ping (Beiping).</p>
<p>Additional News About the Welcome: In addition, several matters are noted below. Namely, the slogans suspended at the East and General Stations on the afternoon of the 8th were completely removed this morning (the 9th). The slogan "Resist Japan, Not Anti-Foreignism" suspended on the Jin'gang Bridge has also disappeared this morning, for reasons unknown. It was originally planned for the Investigation Team to board the train to Ping at the East Station, but it was temporarily changed to the General Station due to concerns that the public groups passing through the Italian concession might be inconvenient. Also, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, Dajing Road in Hebei, East Ma Road, and Asahi Street in the Japanese Concession were completely cleared of pedestrians. Chinese merchants and residents hung flags to express welcome, while the Japanese Concession made no expression. According to a member of the Investigation Team's entourage, the Investigation Team is commissioned by the League of Nations and only recognizes the Chinese government and the Japanese government, knowing nothing else. The task of going to Beiping this time is to contact the former Northeast officials and inquire about the situation in the Northeast. All banquets in Beiping have been declined, except for Zhang Xueliang's banquet on the evening of the 10th. They will stay in Ping for about a week, and it is expected that the special train will leave the customs on the 18th, but the responsibility for protecting the train outside the customs is still under negotiation. After arriving in Shenyang, they plan to divide into small groups and go to Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places to investigate. After the investigation is completed, they will go to Nara, Japan, to compile the report, and after it is compiled, they will exchange opinions with Japan and China before sending the report to the League of Nations Council.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Gethsemane in Geneva</h3>
<p>Sayings of prophecy and taboo are not spoken by those who are accomplished, but their inexplicable accuracy can be revealed by events. At the beginning of the Shanghai unrest, someone asked the Jishang Altar at sea, and the oracle said: "Three three nine nine, Yin Shen Mao You, the sound of Hu horses neighing, the sleeping lion roaring, the sun dark, the stars scarce, heroes vying to run, beauty cannot win, law cannot hold, Germany assists in the middle, drinking yellow dragon wine, intending Austrian aid, eventually taking the lead, swords and spears colliding, light shooting at Dou and Niu." The oracle embeds the names of Japan, England, America, France, Belgium, Italy, and Austria. Could it be that the Second World War is about to begin? There is also a legend that Liu Bowen's Tui Bei Tu commentary says: "Remove the Jinling Pagoda, close the door and kill yourself, the sun rises in the east every day, the moon sets in the west, the Hu children's homeland raises beacon fires, why worry about the soft grass bow, eyes see the mountains and rivers fall into the hands of barbarians, winter ends, and Jiangnan has eternal worries, prosperity suddenly turns into rubble and mounds, turning the tide in one two nine, causing the white sun to form a deep feud, seeing the sun west and rest." The words of the yellow silk young woman mean that the strong and violent can rest. Is it not the so-called League of Nations that bears the mission of world peace? The League of Nations is in Geneva. Geneva means, according to righteousness, that the strong and violent can also rest. The frequent occurrence of assassinations at home, the development of communist thought among university students, and the active left-wing movement of women, with such internal disputes, yet still relying on strength and violence to bully others, not knowing that once disaster strikes within the walls, disintegration is imminent. Alas. It can rest.</p>
<h3>Zheng Yimei's Record of Experiencing the Calamity in Qingyun</h3>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, I personally experienced the calamity. My residence was in Hengyu Lane on Qingyun Road. The Eight Character Bridge was to its north, and the Tiantong'an Station and Qingyun Bridge were to its east, which was the most intense area of engagement and hand-to-hand combat. I and my family escaped, but did not have time to take our belongings. We stayed at a friend's house at No. 6 Gengqing Lane on Xin Zha Road. Looking at the flames of war connecting the sky north of the Suzhou River, I was deeply worried about my humble home where I used to read and rest. I risked smoke and bullets and circled from the rear to the front line four times. Reaching Anxing Road, I was always stopped by soldiers, who said that Japanese soldiers were guarding nearby and that if they saw people moving, they might be targeted and shot. After the 19th Route Army withdrew, the Japanese soldiers still did not dare to go deep. I was able to take advantage of the situation to return, like Ding Lingwei returning as a crane, only to find the doors wide open, no longer the same as before. Moreover, ruined walls and broken tiles hindered my feet everywhere. Climbing the stairs to inspect, the clothes-drying platform only had charred wood left, still standing askew. The west wall was opened by a cannon blast. Belongings were scattered on the ground, and clothes and valuables were all looted, which was all the work of local rascals, not something that the fighting soldiers could prevent. What was most regrettable was the books and magazines. I had collected hundreds of thousands of them, many of which were rare and out of print. Searching the cabinets, they were scattered, discarded, and trampled, with no perfect copies left. I could only give them up. After the Japanese soldiers occupied the area and the war had subsided slightly, I obtained a permit from the Public Works Bureau and hired a car to go north of Shanghai, intending to load and take out the remaining looted items. Unexpectedly, at that time, the neighbor on the left caught fire, and the wall of the house on the right collapsed. It was fortunate that I was not buried in it. Moreover, the remaining items had been stolen by rats and dogs over the past few days, and only two or three out of ten items were left. Broken tables and chairs were picked up by me because people abandoned them. The country was broken, and the family was destroyed, which was unbearable. I wrote this article to inform my friends who inquired.</p>
<h3>Shanghai War and Military Weapons (7) - One Zang</h3>
<p>After the European War, anti-aircraft guns underwent technological improvements, increased speed, electric linkage devices, and improved measurement accuracy to the extent that we expected. There is also an extremely fierce gun, which is mounted on a specially constructed railway gun carriage and can be transported on rails, called a train gun. It is often used for field battles, fortress battles, and defense along national borders. In 1825, the year after American Stephenson invented the steam locomotive, French General Nonjury invented a gun carriage mounted on a locomotive. During the American Civil War in 1860, it was used on the battlefield. The government of the Confederate States of America used this gun to attack Pennsylvania, and the Northern Army was repeatedly defeated. However, its use was limited by the track, and the rotation of the gun position also caused various inconveniences, so it could not fully exert its effectiveness. Later, after the European War, the Germans devoted themselves to improvement and achieved unexpected results. The caliber of the muzzle is generally 20 to 40 centimeters, and it can shoot as far as 30,000 to 50,000 meters. When charging into battle, it is often used as a pioneer.</p>
<p>In 1916, Frenchmen Fauchon and Boberre invented the electric gun, which surpassed the effectiveness of gunpowder for launching. It uses electricity entirely to propel projectiles to extremely long distances. Because in the past, if gunpowder was to be used to shoot over long distances, the initial velocity had to be increased, so a large amount of gunpowder had to be used, which increased the temperature and pressure inside the gun chamber, thus being extremely restricted. Electric guns rely on the interaction of electric fields and currents and can freely obtain power using line cars, so there are no restrictions, and there is no sound or smoke, increasing the initial velocity greatly. The shell can quickly shoot to distant places. Today, countries are competing with each other, studying practical methods. If the experiment is completed, the progress of the revolution in the arms world will be incredible.</p>
<h3>Suspicion (1) - Cheng Zhanlu</h3>
<p>Obstacles on the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line have created opportunities for steamboat owners. Each riverboat traveling from Suzhou to Shanghai is extremely crowded. The passengers in the open cabins are packed tightly together, shoulder to shoulder, like shoes on a shoe tree. As soon as there is some space, someone will try to squeeze in, and if you don't let them, they will force their way in, using their buttocks as a shoe tree. In these chaotic times, taking a boat is not just taking a boat; it's like cramming into a shoe tree.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the water route from Suzhou to Shanghai is not far. If you can't make it in one day, you can make it in two. If it were a journey of ten or eight days, with long-term muscle compression and squeezing, I'm afraid the passengers would be injured and disabled by the time the boat reached the shore, and would have to be carried off the boat on stretchers. Alas! Who is causing you this pain? Everyone on the boat says, "The Eastern Dwarves are causing us this pain!"</p>
<p>The general sentiment on the boat is praise for the Nineteenth Route Army's loyalty and courage. They generally understand and sympathize with the changes in strategy and the shortening of the battle lines. They gradually talk about the people of Jiangbei who are traitors, and everyone is extremely angry. They curse the Eastern Dwarves and then the Jiangbei Dwarves. Among the crowd, there is a short man in a Western suit who remains silent, no matter how heated the discussion gets. He neither curses the Eastern Dwarves nor the Jiangbei Dwarves. He just stares at people with his eyes wide open.</p>
<p>This stirs up suspicion in everyone's minds. Inevitably, people begin to pay attention to the short man. Looking at him, the depth of his skin color and the structure of his face suggest that he is not a domestic product but an Eastern product. Most suspiciously, there is a plaster on his right cheek, and on the back of the plaster, there is a small red seal, clearly the brand of a certain pharmacy in Suzhou. This is worth studying. Since he is wearing a domestic plaster, then this short man is of course a domestic short man, not an imported short man. However, inferior goods are often disguised as domestic goods by sticking a label on them to conceal their true ingredients. So, the more a domestic plaster is stuck on his face, the more it shows that this short man is not a domestic short man, but an imported short man.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the cabin, people are whispering to each other:</p>
<p>"This short man's behavior is suspicious. Could he be a spy sent by the enemy?"</p>
<p>"I've heard that the enemy's spies are extremely active. We must monitor him and guard against him."</p>
<p>"Whether he is a spy or not, we must test him. But how do we test him? It's a pity that there is no committee to check enemy goods here!"</p>
<p>Checking enemy goods is very easy. According to a popular saying, "Open your mouth and see your throat, lift your tail and see your gender." Let's chat with him for a while, and trick him into saying a few words. Then it will be clear immediately whether he is a domestic product or an enemy product.</p>
<p>So, someone starts a conversation with the short man, but the short man refuses to speak. Sometimes he shakes his head, sometimes he nods. Later, more and more people talk to him, and he simply closes his eyes to rest, as if annoyed by people chattering endlessly.</p>
<p>Starting today, short stories responding to current events will be published. [P[L</p>

<p>Representatives must be strictly limited; the number should not exceed 500. Representatives from all sectors were astonished upon hearing this, saying that for a city as large and important as Tianjin, only 400-500 people at the station to welcome the delegation would be unsightly. Thus, it was changed to 1,000 people. At the second preparatory meeting, it was changed to 2,000 people. Public organizations still felt the number was too small and changed it to 4,000 people. Moreover, due to a telegram from Nanjing stating that the investigation team had changed its itinerary and would only stay in Tianjin for half a day, it was decided that a public banquet would be held at the provincial government at noon that day, and representatives would be received at the West Lake Hotel once, while the tea party would be cancelled. At 3 p.m. on the 7th, the final preparatory meeting was held at the city hall, and the number of people allowed to welcome the delegation was strictly limited, with welcome badges distributed. Two hundred and forty people from the industrial sector, 200 from the commercial sector, 200 from the education sector, 30 from the women's sector, 12 from the legal sector, and the number from the press, originally limited to 50, was increased to 80 after much argument. Eighty from the autonomous region, 200 from the party and government sectors, totaling 1,042 people. This was two-thirds less than the originally planned 4,000 people. One or two chief representatives were selected from each sector to facilitate contact upon boarding the train, but in reality, these representatives were not selected by each sector themselves but were designated by the preparatory office. Their names were not announced in advance. However, this also caused a reaction. The issue of flags also caused disputes. Originally, the preparatory office decided not to use flags to save money, but the majority were dissatisfied with this. Since the thousand-plus representatives going to the station to welcome the delegation included people from the party, government, military, police, gentry, business, and academic sectors, wouldn't it become a disorganized mob without flags as identification? As a result of the debate, the preparatory office went to create white cloth banners with inscriptions in both Chinese and English, to be used uniformly. In addition, materials submitted to the investigation team have been sent to Beiping. Now, there is only a photo album of the Tianjin Incident left. Someone proposed drawing a map of the Tianjin Incident, marking where the plainclothes team based themselves, where they attacked, and where they retreated, so that the ironclad case of the Japanese concession authorities' support of the plainclothes team would be clearly displayed on paper, leaving no room for escape. Someone also suggested asking the investigation team to inspect the remains of the Japanese army's bombardment of Chinese territory, but neither suggestion was adopted by the preparatory committee. The only somewhat satisfactory matter was the letter from the National Salvation Association of all sectors to the investigation team, which described in detail those responsible for the Tianjin Incident, with over 1,500 prominent figures from all sectors signing their names. In addition, people's representatives such as Zhang Biling and Bian Baimei prepared several questions to ask the investigation team in person.</p>
<p>The Situation After Arrival in Tianjin: Provincial Chairman Wang Shuchang sent Huang Zongfa to Jinan on the 7th to meet the special train and ordered all counties along the route and the garrison to protect the train properly. In addition to sending Armored Train Commander Cao Yaozhang to Dezhou on an armored train to meet the delegation, the Beiping Pacification Headquarters also sent Gao Jiyi, Shen Zutong, and Ning Xiangnan to Tianjin at noon on the 8th to welcome the delegation. Both the East and Main Railway Stations were freshly painted and cleaned, and each station was decorated with an elaborate arch, several yards high, which was extremely beautiful. Lines were marked on the platforms to prevent the representatives from all sectors from becoming disorderly. National flags were hung all along the platform, decorated with colorful electric lights, and across the footbridge above the platform hung white cloth banners inscribed with "Welcome to the Peace Envoys of the League of Nations Investigation Team." There were also Chinese and English banners from the Northern Railway Special Party Department and the Northern Railway Labor Union, inscribed with "The Chinese People Would Rather Die for Justice Than Submit to Tyranny; The Chinese People Will Never Accept Conditions That Would Lose Sovereignty and Humiliate the Nation; The Chinese People Would Rather Be Shattered Like Jade Than Preserved Like Tile." On the morning of the 9th, from seven o'clock onward, representatives from all sectors gathered one after another at the main station. In addition to the police and soldiers suppressing the ground, there were also 300 Boy Scouts maintaining order. Second Army Chief of Staff Liu Jialuan and Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Yimin served as the chief and deputy commanders of the military and government organs, while Municipal Party Committee Member Shao Hua served as the chief commander of the public organizations. At 8:30, the investigation team's special train had already passed Yangliuqing, only thirty-odd miles from Tianjin. The municipal government sent Section Chief Shen Dijia to the West Railway Station to express welcome. At 9:00, the special train entered the station amidst the melodious sound of military music. After the train stopped, Miss Shaofen, daughter of the late President Li Yuanhong, was the first to board the train and present flowers on behalf of the people of the city. Next, Provincial Chairman Wang Shuchang, Mayor Zhou Longguang, and representatives from all sectors, Zhang Boling, Bian Baimei, and Hu Zhengzhi, boarded the train to welcome the delegation, exchanged a few words, and then got off the train and left the station, accompanied by receptionists to cars. The delegation split into two groups. One group took the investigation committee to the West Lake Hotel, and the other took the Chinese representatives and staff to the Heshunde Hotel. British representative Sir Lytton was received by Chinese representative Gu Weijun. German representative Dr. Schnee was received by Duan Maolan. French representative General Claudel was received by Shen Dijia. Italian representative Count Aldrovandi was received by Tao Jian. American representative General McCoy was received by Zhang Rui. At 10:00, the investigation team first received the people from the Northeast Tianjin Association, including the three elders of the Northeast, who described the circumstances of the Northeast Incident. All the investigating committee members attached great importance to this. The conversation lasted two hours. Huang Zongfa then received the consuls and military attachés of various countries stationed in Tianjin in succession, for about ten minutes each. After that, they received representatives Zhang Boling, Bian Baimei, Hu Zhengzhi, Zhang Pintih, Wang Wendian, and Li Shaofen, who presented written opinions. The conversation lasted about ten minutes, inquiring about Pu Yi being forced to go to Liaoning and the Tianjin Incident. By then, it was already 12:30, and there was no time to meet the press. They then went to the provincial government for a public banquet. Wang Shuchang gave a welcome speech, saying (The Chinese nation has always loved peace. The League of Nations is an organization to maintain world peace. Now, because of the Sino-Japanese Incident, it has sent representatives from various countries to travel across the ocean to investigate the truth, so that fair sanctions and peaceful solutions can be achieved. Today, the investigation team is honored to visit Tianjin, representing the 30 million people of Hebei Province, we extend our sincere welcome and wish for permanent world peace.) British representative Lord Lytton replied, briefly saying (Our delegation is entrusted by the League of Nations to come to the Far East to investigate the Sino-Japanese dispute, so that justice and peace can be permanently guaranteed. Our delegation has been warmly welcomed in both Japan and China, but I feel that it is not welcoming our five-member delegation but welcoming the League of Nations, which maintains world peace. Having arrived in China from Japan, we have heard and seen much and obtained a great deal of material. Soon we will go to the final destination, the Northeast, and after the investigation mission is completed, we will submit a general report to the League of Nations. We believe that the League of Nations will have a fair and peaceful method to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute.) The banquet ended at about 2:00 p.m., and at 3:00 p.m., they boarded the train to Beiping.</p>
<p>Incidental Notes on the Welcome: In addition, there are several matters to be appended below. The banners hung at the East and Main Railway Stations on the afternoon of the 8th were completely removed this morning (the 9th). The banners with the slogan "Resist Japan, Not Exclude Foreigners" on the Jin'gang Bridge have also disappeared this morning, for unknown reasons. The investigation team was originally scheduled to board the train to Beiping at the East Station. However, because public organizations had to pass through the Italian concession, which was feared to be inconvenient, it was changed back to boarding the train at the Main Station. Also, from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Hebei Avenue, East Avenue, and Asahi Street in the Japanese concession were completely cleared of people. Chinese merchants and residents hung flags to express their welcome. The Japanese concession showed no expression. According to a member of the investigation team, the investigation team is entrusted by the League of Nations and only knows the Chinese government and the Japanese government. They know nothing else. The mission to Beiping this time is to contact the former governor of the Northeast and inquire about the situation in the Northeast. All banquets in Beiping have been declined, except for Zhang Xueliang's banquet on the evening of the 10th. The delegation will stay in Beiping for about a week. The special train is expected to leave the customs on the 18th. However, the issue of protection responsibility for trains traveling outside the customs is still under discussion. After arriving in Shenyang, they plan to divide into small groups and go to Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places to investigate. After the investigation is completed, they will go to Nara, Japan, to compile a report, and then exchange views with Japan and China before sending the report to the League of Nations Administrative Council.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Quiescent Lodge, Geneva</h3>
<p>Theories of prophecy and taboo. Those who understand do not speak of them. Yet, there are incredible instances of accuracy, which are truly matters of explanation. When the Shanghai unrest first began, someone consulted the Jisheng Altar by planchette writing on the sea. The planchette writing said: (3399, Yin Shen Mao You, the barbarian horse neighs, the sleeping lion roars, the sun is dark, the stars are dim, heroes compete, beauty is overwhelming, law cannot be maintained, Germany assists in the middle, drinks the yellow dragon wine, Belgium, Italy, Austria support, ultimately lead the way, warfare breaks open, light shines on the constellations.) The planchette writing embeds the names of Japan, England, America, France, Belgium, Italy, and Austria. Is the Second World War about to begin? There is also a legend about Liu Bowen's annotations on the Tui Bei Tu saying: (Tear down the Jinling Pagoda, shut the door and kill yourself. The sun rises in the east every day. The moon sets in the west. Barbarian children rise up in their homeland. Why worry about grass bows? The eyes see the rivers and mountains fall into barbarian hands. Winter ends, the south of the Yangtze River has eternal worries. Prosperity suddenly turns into rubble hills. Returning the Heavens takes one or two periods of sixty years, causing deep hatred with the White Sun. See the sun set in the west and rest.) With the words of the Yellow Silk Young Wife, the powerful and violent can rest. Is the one who bears the mission of world peace not the so-called League of Nations? The League of Nations meets in Geneva. Geneva means, interpreted in the sense of justice, that the powerful and violent can also rest. The repeated incidents of assassination in the country, the development of communist ideas among university students, and the active left-wing movement of women show that internal strife is such, yet we still rely on strength and violence to bully others. I do not know that once a disaster occurs within the walls, the disintegration is imminent. Alas, it can rest.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Qingyun Ordeal by Zheng Yimei</h3>
<p>During the events of January 28th, I personally experienced the ordeal. My residence was in Hengyu Lane on Qingyun Road. The Baziqiao Bridge was to the north, and the Tiantong'an Station and Qingyun Bridge were to the east, making it an area of intense engagement and hand-to-hand combat. I escaped danger with my fellow residents, but I did not have time to take away suitcases or belongings. I stayed at the home of a friend at No. 6 Gengqing Lane, Xinzha Road. Looking at the flames of war connecting the north and south banks of the Suzhou Creek, I could not help but feel disturbed when I thought of my humble abode where I used to read and rest. I braved the smoke and bullets and circled around to the front line four times. Every time I reached Anxing Road, I was stopped by soldiers, who said that Japanese soldiers were closely guarding the area, and if they saw people moving, they would be afraid of being targeted and shot. After the Nineteenth Route Army retreated, the Japanese soldiers still dared not go deep into the area. I was able to take advantage of the situation and slip through like Ding Lingwei returning as a crane. The doors were wide open, and it was no longer the old state. Moreover, the broken walls and shattered tiles hindered my feet everywhere. I climbed the stairs and surveyed the scene. Only charred wood remained of the drying rack, still standing askew. The west wall had been blown open by a cannon, creating a huge opening. The belongings were scattered on the ground, and clothes and valuables had been looted. This was all the work of local petty thieves, which could not be prevented by the soldiers fighting. What was especially regrettable was the books and periodicals. I had collected hundreds of thousands of kinds of them, many of which were rare and out of print. After searching the cabinets, they were scattered, discarded, and trampled, and none were intact. I could only resign myself to it. After the Japanese soldiers occupied the area, the fighting subsided slightly. I went to the Public Works Bureau to obtain a permit and hired a car to go to northern Shanghai to try to carry out the remaining looted items. Unexpectedly, at that time, a fire broke out in the left neighbor's house, and the right neighbor's wall collapsed. It was fortunate that I did not die there. Moreover, because the remaining items had been left there for several days, only 20-30% remained due to petty theft. Broken tables and broken stools, things that others discarded, I picked up. With the country broken and the family destroyed, I could not bear the misery. I have written this article to inform my friends who have inquired about me.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai War and Military Weapons (7) by Yi Zang</h3>
<p>After the European War, anti-aircraft guns underwent technical improvements, increased speed, electric linkage devices, and measuring accuracy to the extent we expected. There is also a very fierce gun that is loaded on specially constructed railway gun carriages and can be transported on railway tracks, called a train gun. It is often used for field and fortress warfare and for defense moving between national borders. The year after Stephenson invented the steam locomotive in 1825, French General Nonjury invented a gun carriage mounted on a locomotive. By 1860, the American Civil War used it on the battlefield. The government of the Confederate States of America used this gun to attack Pennsylvania. The Union Army was repeatedly defeated. However, its effectiveness was limited by the tracks and the rotation of the gun position. Later, after the European War, the Germans devoted their efforts to improving it and achieved surprising results. The caliber of the gun is generally between 20 cm and 40 cm, and it can shoot a distance of 30,000 to 50,000 meters. In the thick of battle, they often serve as pioneers.</p>
<p>In 1916, the Frenchman Fauchon Villeplée invented the electric gun, which surpassed the effectiveness of using gunpowder for launching. It used electricity entirely to make the projectile reach extremely far distances. Because in the past, to shoot long distances with gunpowder, the initial velocity had to be increased, so a large amount of gunpowder had to be used, making the temperature and pressure in the bore higher and higher, which greatly limited it. The electric gun relies on the interaction of the electric field and current and can freely obtain power from line cars. There are no restrictions, and there is no sound or smoke, increasing the initial velocity greatly. The shell can quickly reach distant places. Today, countries are vying with each other to study practical methods. If the experiment is completed, the revolutionary progress of the weapons industry will be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Cloud of Suspicion (1) by Cheng Zhanlu</h3>
<p>Obstacles on the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) railway created opportunities for steamboat owners. Every inland steamboat from Suzhou to Shanghai was packed beyond capacity. Passengers crammed into the steerage, shoulder to shoulder, like shoes packed into a shoe tree. One passenger squeezed in after another, and whoever found a gap would wedge themselves in. If others protested, they would use their buttocks as shoe trees and force their way in. Traveling on a steamboat during these tumultuous times was like "shoe treeing."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the water journey from Suzhou to Shanghai was short. If one day wasn't enough, two days would do. If it were a journey of ten or eight days, passengers would suffer muscle strain and bone injuries from prolonged compression and squeezing. I fear that after the steamboat reached the shore, passengers would have to be carried off on canvas beds. Alas! Who caused you such suffering? The entire ship unanimously said, "The Eastern dwarfs caused us this suffering."</p>
<p>The general consensus on the ship praised the loyalty and bravery of the 19th Route Army. Most people also understood and regretted the change in strategy and the shortening of the battle line. Gradually, the conversation turned to the people north of the Yangtze River who were traitors, and everyone was furious, cursing the Eastern dwarfs and the Jiangbei dwarfs. Among the crowd was a short man in a Western suit who remained silent, no matter how heated the conversation became. He neither cursed the Eastern dwarfs nor the Jiangbei dwarfs. He simply stared at people with wide eyes.</p>
<p>This aroused a cloud of suspicion among the crowd. Everyone involuntarily focused on the short man. The depth of his complexion and the structure of his face suggested that he was not a domestic product but an Eastern one. What was even stranger was that there was a plaster on his right cheek. On the back of the plaster was a small vermilion seal, clearly the logo of a Suzhou pharmacy. This was worth investigating. If he had a domestic plaster, then the short man was certainly a domestic short man and not an imported one. However, inferior goods are often passed off as domestic goods, and a label of domestic goods is often attached to disguise the inferior ingredients. On this point, the more a domestic plaster was pasted on his face, the more it seemed that the short man was not a domestic short man but an imported one.</p>
<p>Thus, there was hushed talk in the cabin:</p>
<p>"This short man's behavior is suspicious. Could he be a spy sent by the enemy?"</p>
<p>"I hear that enemy spies are extremely active. We must monitor him and guard against him."</p>
<p>"Whether he is a spy or not, we must test him. But how do we test him? It's a pity that there is no committee to inspect enemy goods here!"</p>
<p>Inspecting enemy goods is easy. According to a popular saying, "Open your mouth and see your throat, lift your tail and see your sex." We'll chat with him for a while, trick him into saying a few words, and then we can immediately tell whether he is a domestic product or an enemy product.</p>
<p>Someone started chatting with the short man, but the short man refused to speak. He shook his head or nodded. Later, more and more people talked to him, and he simply closed his eyes to rest, as if he was annoyed by people chattering endlessly.</p>
<p>Starting today, we will publish a short story in response to the times, "Record of the Twin Fortresses of War," which will be temporarily suspended for a few days. Please pay attention to readers.</p>

<h3>Gold Speculation Rises Again</h3>
<p>A Certain Bank Acquires Another 175 Taels of Spot Gold</p>
<p>Prices Break Through the 710 Taels Mark: Yesterday, the trend of gold speculation was excellent, with orderly and rapid gains. The morning session experienced slight fluctuations, opening at a stable level. It remained unmoved despite the rise in the silver market. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market improved slightly, and counterparties settled accounts, pushing prices through the 710 taels mark. However, the cash positions of various firms were tight, so prices retreated by 10 taels at noon. The afternoon market was relatively stable. Although exchange rates were loose, market sentiment remained stable, especially since a certain bank continued to acquire spot gold. This allowed prices to maintain support. Ultimately, prices rose again by around 6 taels. A detailed account of the morning and afternoon sessions is provided below:</p>
<p>Morning Session Opens Steadily: The market opened steadily at 5 months with a slight increase of 1 mace, at 703 taels. The large silver bars and Bank of America bonds both rose by a quarter. Fortunately, post-market reports from the trading floor indicated that buyers were content, and there were private telegrams from banks suggesting that silver prices had fallen slightly by one-sixteenth, strengthening market sentiment. Subsequently, buyers became aggressive, with Yuan Maoyong and others continuously entering the market, causing prices to jump by 4 taels to 707.3 taels. There was only a difference of one or two taels, as the foreign exchange rate was stable and gold prices were slightly lower at 706 taels. When HSBC's license remained unchanged and the domestic market also improved, Yuan Maoyong and others entered the market, reaching 709.7 taels at 9:40. When Tong Taichang and others sold, prices immediately fell to 708 taels. Shortly after, Hong Kangyong and speculators came to buy, breaking through the 710 taels mark, reaching 711.5 taels at 9:50. Shortly after, Dalian Gang Ban Yuanheng and others sold, causing a retreat of 3.7-8 mace, reaching 708.3 taels at 10:00. Afterwards, there were ups and downs of two or three taels, fluctuating around 10 taels. At 11:00, the market rebounded to a peak, rising by more than 3 taels, with Hong Kangyong and others competing to buy vigorously, suddenly rising to 12.5 taels. Due to the unloading by Hengyu and others, prices returned to 10 taels. At 11:30, the price was 709.5 taels. Qian Changxiang and others made slight advances, and with British gold seemingly firm, the price increased to 11 taels. At the noon closing, the price was 709.2 mace, with the revealed price remaining at 768 taels, suppressed from 60 taels to 56 taels, and closing at 59 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Session Closes 5.8 Taels Higher: The afternoon session opened at 709 taels, with Zhifengyong leading the way, followed by 10 taels, then selling again, falling to 708.5 taels. Tong Taichang bought in, reaching 709.3 mace. Later, Yifeng and commodities were sold, falling again by one or two mace. At 2:30, the price was 708 taels. Before long, Yifeng sold again, and Zhifengyong commodities also sold, falling by more than one tael, reaching 707.7 mace at 3:00. Until 3:30, it was learned that a certain bank had opened up another 175 taels of cash, with the price at 704 taels. Tong Fengheng sold, and Dalian Gang and small retail investors began to take the plunge, causing the price to suddenly increase by two taels, reaching 709.5 mace at 3:30. Later, because Fuyu Yongde and others came to sell, the price was 707.6 mace at 4:00. Yuantai commodities bought in, increasing to 708.9 mace. Shortly after, the price decreased slightly by six or seven mace, to 708.2 taels, but transactions were limited, so the price only fluctuated slightly. At the 4:30 closing, the price was 708.7 taels, rebounding by 5.8 taels compared to the previous day. The maximum price for the day was 712.5 taels, and the minimum price was 703 taels, with a total fluctuation of 9.5 taels. The disclosed price was suppressed by about 60 taels, with registered prices ranging from 703 taels to 709 taels. Water filling in both the morning and afternoon was 703 taels, and naked gold increased by 4.5 to 5 taels.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Trading by Various Firms: On the trading floor, statistical data showed that Didecheng, Bingxing, Zhifengyong, Yuan Maoyong, Hong Kangyong, Futaiheng, and Richang all bought in. Hengyu and Fuyu bought in and sold out. Shunli, Wanxing, Tong Taichang, Yifengyong, and Yuhe all sold out. Yuantai and Yuan Dayong had balanced entries and exits. In the afternoon, Shunli, Didecheng, Yuantai, and Richang all bought in. Zhifengyong Huixiang commodities had entries and exits at times. Hong Kangyong, Yifengyong, Yifeng, Hengyu, Yuhe, and Fuyu sold out on behalf of Zhongfu, and those who used exchange rate arbitrage sold out.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates in Stabilization</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's license remained unchanged, except for a 0.25 increase in the Indian exchange rate and a 0.25 decrease in the German exchange rate. Although the British and American exchange rates rose, the American and British rates did not change. Therefore, the British and American exchange rates in Shanghai did not change, and the domestic market was stable in the morning and tightened later. As gold prices broke through the 710 taels mark, the afternoon session initially appeared loose but eventually stabilized. British gold was about the same as the previous day, and American gold decreased slightly by 0.0625. As a result, gold speculators settled their accounts and sold gold, making a small profit. Mumbai sold British gold by telegram in the morning, with an estimated total transaction volume of about 45,000 pounds and US$5-600,000.</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Rebounds by 0.25</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from London stated that large silver bars had rebounded by 0.25, with the near-term price at 16 pence and 9375 mils and the forward price at 17 pence. China and the mainland both bought in, but there were few transactions. After the close, the market was quiet, and buyers were content. A telegram from New York stated that the price of American silver also increased by 0.25, with the spot price at 28.5 cents. The London-Shanghai exchange rate rebounded by 0.0625, to 1 shilling, 8 pence, and 3125 mils. Mumbai's spot price increased by 1 anna, to 53 rupees and 11 annas, while the forward price remained at 53 rupees and 12 annas. The British-American exchange rate increased by 0.0625, while the American-British exchange rate remained unchanged, at 3 yuan, 7 jiao, 9 fen, and 875 li.</p>
<h3>Copper Coins Continue to Reach New Low Prices</h3>
<p>Opening at 7 mace, 0 li, and 3.5 hao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the depreciation trend of copper coins continued unabated. As a result, the afternoon market price decreased again by 1.75 li compared to the previous day's low price, reaching 7 mace, 0 li, and 3.5 hao, a new low price never seen before in the Shanghai commercial market. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, there was indeed a period of decline, but it only reached 7 mace, 0 li, and 5 hao. Since then, the price has repeatedly rebounded, never remaining depressed for as long as it has this time. The afternoon market had the potential to continue to decline, so the licensing fee was only 2 li. After someone raised the price, the result was still the same as the early market price, at 7 mace, 0 li, and 3.5 hao, failing to break out above 3.5 hao, showing the precariousness of the situation. The bank's licensing fee was 6 fen, and the drawing fee plus water was 4 mace and 5 fen. The amount of exchange bills made was 350,000 in the early market and 455,000 in the afternoon market. The amount of banknotes was 105,000 in both the early and afternoon markets. The amount of bank transactions was 350,000 in the early market and 500,000 in the afternoon market. The amount of interbank bill transactions was more than 1.2 million, the amount of bank transactions with foreign firms was more than 800,000, the amount of foreign drawing fees was more than 2.1 million, the amount of silver drawing fees was more than 2.5 million, the amount of foreign bank remittances was more than 4.1 million, the amount of exchange mortgages and commodity loans was more than 1.9 million, the amount of Chinese merchant remittances was more than 4.5 million, the amount of mortgages was more than 400,000, the amount of customs duties was more than 500,000, and the amount of commodity loans was 4-500,000. The amount of remittance from the money shop foreign public single was more than 4.9 million, and the amount of remittance from the silver public single was more than 34 million. The amount of small money shop transactions was more than 400,000. The price of small Jiangnan silver coins was 6 mace, 1 fen, and 4 li in the early market and 3 li in the afternoon market. The amount of transactions was 5,500 jiao in both the early and afternoon markets. The price of small Guangdong silver coins was 6 mace, 1 fen, 4 li, and 7 hao in the early market and 8 hao and 7 hu in the afternoon market. The amount of transactions was 125,000 jiao in both the early and afternoon markets. The amount of copper coins was reduced by 500 wen, to 412,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bonds Completed Transactions Yesterday</h3>
<p>Formal Opening Still Pending</p>
<p>Regarding news from last week, it was said that the Chinese Securities Exchange was expected to open soon. This was because the diplomatic situation was relatively peaceful at that time, and the market sentiment was quite good. Brokers had even requested to resume operations. However, observing the recent diplomatic situation, it has fallen into a stalemate. The Japanese side's attitude has hardened, making a resolution difficult for the time being. Moreover, there have been repeated demonstrations of military buildup by land, sea, and air forces, and the future still does not seem optimistic. Therefore, the exchange, considering this situation, has taken a cautious approach and believes that resuming operations is not yet the right time. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance has not issued any instructions to date. Thus, the formal opening of the securities exchange still depends on the overall circumstances, and it is difficult to predict at present. As for various bonds, although there is no formal market, the prices in the gray market continue to be very firm, with only a slight drop compared to the prices when the market was suspended. However, military bonds are down by a relatively large two yuan. As the exchange has not yet opened, brokers have decided to settle old transactions through the gray market and transfer them to the exchange, so as to gradually reduce old transactions and lighten the burden. However, the exchange absolutely prohibits the transfer of new transactions. It is found that the amount settled through the exchange yesterday included 20,000 yuan for the 19 Customs bonds, 10,000 yuan each for the 20 Customs Consolidated Tax bonds, and 5,000 yuan for the 20 bonds, totaling 45,000 yuan. The total amount of forward transactions has now been reduced to over 4.9 million yuan.</p>
<h3>More Trading of Yarn and Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>Sales of spot cotton yarn have increased compared to yesterday, but the market situation remains sluggish and depressed. This is because the overall situation is uncertain, and the ceasefire talks have stalled again, leading to increased public anxiety and making it more difficult for commerce to recover. However, there have been some sporadic transactions in the Sichuan and South China regions, while business from other regions has stagnated. The northern route has long been occupied by Japanese yarn, which sells for ten or more taels less than Chinese yarn. In short, with the current unrest, the future of yarn sales is difficult to revive. Local manufacturers, seeing the unfavorable environment, are extremely flexible in selling yarn, with no intention of raising prices. It is found that a total of 827 bales were purchased by various regions throughout the day, with 400 bales going to Sichuan, 175 bales to Shantou, 90 bales to Guangdong, 25 bales to the northern region, 35 bales to the inland, 5 bales to Fujian, and 97 bales traded among peers. Prices have slightly fallen by 2.5 cents. Shenxin Factory has released 400 bales of 20-count "Human Bell" yarn at a price of 174 taels inclusive of tax.</p>
<h3>Shenxin Continues to Import Large Volumes of Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market situation is becoming more and more calm, but the foreign cotton situation shows signs of stabilization. However, with rising prices, market sentiment is still good. The market's current need for cotton is mainly driven by Shenxin's strong import volume. Other mills are purchasing less due to sluggish yarn sales, but the arrival of goods from various regions is still scarce. The selling prices of spot cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Shandong American cotton 34, 75. Shenxin imported 1,000 bales, goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 31, 75. Another 2,700 bales.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Cotton 34, 75. Another 1,700 bales.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Initially Soft, Eventually Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to the sluggishness of Wall Street and profit-taking by bulls, but later recovered due to short covering. Futures rose 2 to 4 points, and spot prices rose 5 points. English cotton futures fell 1 to 4 points, and spot prices rose 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 10 points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram records are as follows (11th day telegram):</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day Combined Shanghai Standard English Cotton Compared to Previous Day Combined Shanghai Standard</p>
<p>5.616 fell 3.26 26.20 5.449 fell 1.30 30.20</p>

<h3>Grains: The Shanghai Rice Market, Sunny Turning Weak</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, early Northern Non-glutinous rice from the Liliguo area was still scarce. Premium Pujang goods, around number 7 or 8, were quoted with a premium of one dime in the morning. Ordinary fluctuations were limited, as customers reported heavy losses from telegrams. No turnaround in incoming goods was seen. Limited arrivals of Xisu white glutinous rice and Tonglibang rice led to market prices rising by nearly one dime. Changing to negative, prices of two yuan to match rivals. Yang Du Jiao rice was out of stock. Sales to customer regions and the local city became more active, and the market trend hardened.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, rice from various regions, numbers 5 and 6, arrived. The weather cleared in the morning, and buyers were not very enthusiastic. Premium goods from the Northern region were quoted with a premium of two dimes. Slightly over a thousand stones of thin rice and early rice were recently stored. Prices rose three dimes compared to the previous market, changing one yuan. Yang Du Jiao rice saw no change.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales in Hankou Very Active</h3>
<p>Military Demand Continues to be Good</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was very active, with excellent demand from the Hankou region. The overall market saw the purchase of 5,000 bags of small ground rice. Military rice sales were also good, with reports of 5,000 to 6,000 bags being shipped out. However, there are ample stocks, and new arrivals are expected soon. Therefore, prices have not been able to rise along with the active sales. However, with the Hankou region continuing to actively purchase, the market should remain stable. A total of 7,000 bags of small ground rice were sold throughout the day, priced at 9.53 yuan to 9.65 yuan. 300 bags of Saigon No. 1 were sold, priced at 11 yuan to 10.7 yuan. The futures market was also slightly active, with over 1,000 tons traded throughout the day, including No. 1 Saigon for April delivery at 5.15 taels, small ground rice for April delivery passing through the dyke at 4.66 taels, and the Yinghua Company delivering for April at 4.634 taels.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both spot and futures markets for flour showed improvement. Spot goods were inquired about by the Northern region, and the path for stockpiling purchases was reactivated. Furthermore, with reports of high prices for foreign wheat, and active flour sales in Tianjin, market sentiment was unanimously optimistic. Various factories raised their asking prices by nearly a cent, and the market immediately saw a gradual upward trend. Spot "Battleship Lao Che Pai" was up by half a cent, with "Battleship" at 2.075 taels and "Lao Che" at 2.0675 taels. May delivery of green "Battleship" was at 2.085 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar See a Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a decline in prices during the clearing session of the association. Due to sluggish sales, buying interest was very quiet and transactions remained dull. Initially, sellers quoted 13.1 taels for No. 24 Dutch raw white sugar, but there were no inquiries. Subsequently, a certain firm was eager to sell, and the transaction price fell to 11.95 taels for 200 bags. The market remained flat and uninspired. Medium sugar and other types also lacked buyers and the trend was weak. Transactions for Taikoo sugar were also sluggish. "B Mark" was still priced at 16.2 taels, and "HM Mark" at 13.6 taels. The market situation was relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Red Yeast Rice Rebounds Upward</h3>
<p>The sales of red yeast rice are now starting to pick up. Shipments of Chaozhou goods have continued to arrive in recent days. Top-grade was once offered at 28 to 29 taels. Lower-grade sales are more active, priced around 18 taels. Market stocks are quite low, and it is heard that suppliers have already telegraphed to continue purchasing. However, land prices have already risen, so it is not yet known whether the prices will match. It is generally expected that the market will likely rise in the future.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth: Figured Yarn Suddenly Popular</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market situation has shown a trend of transitioning from stable to declining in recent days. Yesterday, the decline in fine cloth was the most severe, falling by about two cents. Racing cloth sold for 8.6 taels, and Evergreen for 9 taels. This is mainly due to the increased supply from Hubei. 12-pound goods saw a slight decrease of 2.5 to 5 cents. Demand from dye factories is still quite strong. Yesterday, the Hankou Datong region purchased fine twill cloth, but in small quantities. Various brands showed significant fluctuations. The Heliao gang continued to search for coarse twill cloth. 12-pound Three Fish was sold for 5.2 taels, Three Rabbit for 5.15 taels, and 11-pound Cat for 5.1 taels.</p>
<p>Western Cloth: The market showed more declines than gains. White striped linen, pearl yarn, striped poplin, and plain poplin all declined. Yesterday, only figured yarn suddenly became popular. The Tianjin and Shandong regions both sent additional orders. The "Zedeji" brand of mixed colors was particularly popular and has been completely sold out. The price was 3.15 cents, a sharp increase of one cent compared to last week. More plain crepe cloth has arrived. In addition to "Kangfuhang" having spot goods, "Anli" has also arrived. The price is 4.75 taels. The customer base for plain Western yarn has gradually become active, and the price is lower than last year.</p>
<h3>Metals: Blue Lead Sales in Tianjin Very Strong</h3>
<p>The blue lead business in Tianjin was very smooth yesterday, with about 600 to 700 dan being sold. The price was 13.75 taels per dan. Although there was no progress compared to before, the trend of vigor was much better than before.</p>
<h3>French Western Nails: Asking Price Increased by 2.5 Cents</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the depletion of French Western nails and good customer sales, the market situation is excellent. The standard price rose by another 2.5 cents yesterday, with each box selling for 8.5 taels. A total of 400 to 500 barrels of goods were sold. The purchasers were the Yangtze River and Qingdao regions. It is said that many of the inland river regions also made small purchases.</p>

<p>Opinion</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the National Crisis Conference</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>The National Crisis Conference, I originally thought, was just a farcical and responsibility-shifting act by the government. I fundamentally did not approve of it. Later, the government, fearing that the National Crisis Conference members would be too insensitive and discuss other political issues and fundamental national policies, added three narrow restrictions (appeasement), (disaster relief), and (resisting aggression). The government's intentions and tactics became even clearer.</p>
<p>Of the originally appointed 500+ members, only 100+ attended, less than one-third. I thought these one-third of the members went with joy, wondering what brilliant ideas and far-sighted plans they had. I was going to calm down, quiet my mind, and listen carefully. However, according to the Luoyang dispatch in today's newspaper, the National Crisis Conference has resolved the principle of jointly resisting aggression. Their resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Jointly Resisting Aggression Proposal, resolved: (A) For any enemy that infringes upon the nation's political independence and territorial administrative integrity, the government should use both military force and diplomacy to resist to the end. Any treaty that violates the above principles must not be signed. (B) During the period when the government is striving to implement the above principles, all the people of the country, regardless of party or class, should do their utmost to support the government and jointly resist aggression.</p>
<p>I say that the government should use military force and diplomacy to resist to the end. This is entirely the government's prerogative. Even without holding the National Crisis Conference, the government has already said that it will resist for a long time. There is no need for the members to say such official words again. If they say that any treaty that violates the above principles must not be signed, I ask, what can the members do if it is signed secretly? Also, during the period when the government is implementing the above principles, all the people of the country should, regardless of party or class, do their utmost to support the government and jointly resist aggression. This is not only the case during the National Crisis period, but also should be the case even when there is no National Crisis. However, the people of the country, dissatisfied with the government's actions, divide into parties and classes and make things difficult for the government. I ask, how much ability and what best methods do the members have to eliminate this divisive situation?</p>
<p>(2) The diplomatic policy proposal of the National Crisis was resolved: Actively contact friendly countries that advocate justice, maintain the League of Nations covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, in order to obtain the sympathy of various countries and consolidate the permanent peace of the Pacific.</p>
<p>This point has been happening for six months since the September 18th Northeast Incident. Has the government not done this kind of work? Has the government not even thought about it? Because the government is fundamentally unsound and the methods are not thorough, this is true. If you say that the Chinese government does not even have this knowledge and needs the members to instruct them, then what kind of government is it really? But to compete with Japan diplomatically, see if China has talent? Does it have the economy? Does it have a strong government as its backing? May I ask, what solutions do the members have?</p>
<p>After reading the above two resolutions, I believe even more that it is an empty and farcical performance, completely meaningless. I am even more convinced that my observations are not wrong. The members have really good tastes and really good spirits, worth running thousands of miles to do such a conference and resolve such principles, alas!</p>

<h3>New Ballads of the Shanghai Disaster</h3>
<p>— Dream Cottage Master</p>
<p>Sighing at Renting a House</p>
<p>Since Songyu has been lost, the south of the Yangtze is in danger. People's hearts are wavering, where will they go? Large and small households leave their hometowns, competing to rent houses in Shanghai. Shanghai's rich people use houses as fields, with a house bringing in thousands of taels of silver a year. Poor children have no money, how can they find a place? They can only borrow half a floor to shelter from the wind and rain. I don't know what the landlords are thinking, treating houses as nests and people as birds. Ten families rent two dilapidated houses, and even a small space under the stove costs a lot of money. The price of houses is many times higher than in the past because of the chaos, and there are so many people that it is difficult to find a house. Poor children look up at the house and sigh with worry, lamenting the rent is pressing them. If you have money, you can live, if you have no money, you have to leave. The landlords are heartless and show no sympathy. It's a pity that the Jianghai region has fallen into war, but it has become a source of wealth for the landlords. They only know that this place is a safe haven, but who knows that it is not easy to live in Chang'an? Don't you see that in the war zone, nine out of ten families have no houses, and they cry in the rain of Jiangnan with calloused feet. To be able to rent a house to sleep in is a blessing, even if you are trapped and oppressed every day.</p>
<p>Burying the Remains</p>
<p>Burying the remains, the remains are scattered on the winding riverbank. The faces are like ash, mixed with mud and blood. Dogs and crows peck at the flesh, leaving nothing intact. Corpses and bone mountains support the chaotic hemp. Skulls with teeth grow by the roadside. The sun steams, releasing hundreds of poisons. The remaining souls are tossed about by the wind and sand. After all, the invading soldiers are benevolent to you, burying you one by one in the mud. Although you have no clothes or coffin, it is still better than being ignored by your fellow countrymen. The battlefield just passed, and eagles pounced in. Fresh traces of battle are still visible. Tonight, spirits cry in the Jiang River rain, the sky is dark, the moon is black, and green phosphorus is blown. At this time, the gentlemen's dreams are long. It's a pity they never knew this situation.</p>
<p>Recent Events, Frustration</p>
<p>Cutting the ground and singing, I wish to violate everything. Turning back my spear, powerless, I frequently wipe away tears. Who can shoot down the rampant nine crows? The six dragons are uneven, already flying away. How can a few words resolve the situation? They only fight over one chess piece, ruining the whole game. The gentlemen only know to cry in Qin's court, lamenting that the Central Plains horses are growing fat.</p>
<h3>Husband-Seeking Corps</h3>
<p>— Pillar Reverence</p>
<p>Japanese bandits invaded Shanghai and were fiercely attacked by the 19th Route Army, resulting in numerous deaths. Many corpses were thrown into the sea. Japanese women then formed a husband-seeking corps. This is another good story in military history, which I commemorate with a poem.</p>
<p>The isolated army opened fire to welcome the enemy. White bones scattered in the blue sea. Adding a new rhyme to Penglai Mountain. The husband-seeking corps climbs Husband-Watching Mountain.</p>
<h3>Banquet for the League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>— Pillar Reverence</p>
<p>When the League of Nations investigation team arrived in Nanjing, a certain dignitary hosted a banquet, providing Chinese candles, a seven-stringed zither, and other items. His wife, a certain lady, sincerely entertained the team, and the League of Nations investigation team was very happy. Many newspapers reported on this matter. Therefore, I compose this poem to commemorate it, and also to show the party and state leaders' attention to diplomacy.</p>
<p>Gorgeous makeup, red candles, wine poured frequently. Who is like the general, deeply patriotic? Afraid that China has no relationship with other countries. Teach your woven fingers to play the zither's heart even more.</p>
<h3>National Crisis Conference</h3>
<p>— Pillar Reverence</p>
<p>How many years of internal strife and warfare have been endured. How did the Japanese pirates run rampant? Our generation will be lost today. God has no talent to manage the masses. How can the weak willingly be eaten by the strong? The party's power does not allow the common people to be equal. What good is it to come to the meeting? Caged birds can hardly sing freely.</p>
<h3>Traitor</h3>
<p>— Pillar Reverence</p>
<p>How did so many traitors appear? It is sad to drive sparrows away in flocks. Six years of party rule. Seizing the emperor. (When Mr. Chiang was in power, people called him the party emperor. In fact, everyone in the party-state wanted to be the party emperor. The civil wars of the past few years were all internal wars between Kuomintang comrades, all wanting to be the party emperor). A hundred Shenzhou lands reduced to ashes. The bright moon over the sea, pearls are tears. Wusong weeps at night, ghosts form piles. Calmly making plans in Jingluo. Who actually opened the door and welcomed the thieves?</p>
<p>Lin Zhong Science</p>
<h3>The Most Explosive Explosive</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>The most explosive explosive is nitroglycerin C3H5(NO3)3. Take a drop of nitroglycerin and strike it on an iron anvil, and it will immediately produce an extraordinary explosion. When this substance decomposes, it can receive a large amount of gas and expand its volume. One volume of nitroglycerin, when converted into gas, can become 1,298 volumes, and the heat generated at this time is even greater than that in the air, becoming 10,384 volumes. Therefore, nitroglycerin has a hundred times more power than ordinary gunpowder, so it is often used as an extremely strong explosive. To manufacture a large amount of nitroglycerin, use one volume of concentrated nitric acid with a specific gravity of 1.47 to 1.49 and two volumes of sulfuric acid, mixing them together. Place seven pounds of the mixed liquid in a ceramic pot. After cooling, take one pound of glycerin with a specific gravity of 1.25 and slowly pour it into the pot. At this time, the mixed liquid in the pot will generate heat, and you must be very careful when stirring. Stop stirring when the mixed liquid reaches 80 degrees Fahrenheit and does not rise further. Let it stand for 15 minutes, and gradually pour the mixed liquid into six calumn ha of cold water. At that time, an oil-like nitroglycerin will be produced and drop to the bottom of the pot. At this time, wash it several times with clean water, and finally wash it with alkaline water to remove its remaining acidity. Mix in one percent magnesium oxide, and the nitroglycerin is made and can be used.</p>
<p>Pure nitroglycerin is pure white, but usually it is a yellow or brown heavy liquid, with an odor and a sweet and spicy taste. The specific gravity is 1.6, and it has extreme explosiveness and toxicity.</p>
<p>Blasting Gelatine is a product of nitroglycerin manufacturing. The manufacturing method is to take one part of guncotton and dissolve it in nine parts of nitroglycerin. This blasting gelatine can be called the first type of fiercely explosive smokeless gunpowder. Its fuse is made by mixing nine tenths of explosive silver with one tenth of guncotton, and then mixing in a small amount of camphor.</p>

<h3>The Death of a Wounded Soldier (Continued)</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>(Friend! Take good care of yourself, your body belongs to China, your survival is of great significance to us!)</p>
<p>(However,):: he replied to me: (Good brother, my body is already useless, I will definitely die,::: please write a letter for me immediately to take back home: teach my family to take good care of the children for me,:: when they grow up, avenge me!::)</p>
<p>(:::::) I could only nod in agreement. At this time, the younger brothers and sisters couldn't help but cry, as if their own mother was about to die.</p>
<p>(Then my home address is Qiongya Beizhen, Guangdong::) He pointed to the symbol on his chest again, (This is my::name::) His voice, in the end, was simply gasping.</p>
<p>Soon, he shouted wildly again. His eyes glared angrily, then helplessly closed his eyelids. He blindly grabbed at the air with his hands, frantically, spasmodically. Everyone in the room paid attention to him. I thought (Ah! He is about to die!) So I hurriedly called the nurse and asked her to quickly call the doctor. When the doctor hurriedly arrived, he was already powerless and had entered a temporary calm. Suddenly, he opened his eyes again, tears flowed down his cheeks, his lips vibrated forcefully, his dirty teeth showed ferociously, and his face was stained with a thick layer of dark filth. Finally, he tried his best to shout.</p>
<p>(Revenge!::Kill! Kill!)</p>
<p>Soon, his breathing was weakened to the lowest limit, and he slowly fell into a state of sleep. Ah! He died just like that!</p>
<p>When we walked out of the hospital, I was completely in a state of confusion, but my mood was very excited. I kept chanting: (He is dead, he has died in battle, so what about us? We should avenge the dead!)</p>
<h3>The Awakened Her</h3>
<p>— Xiu</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, most of my girlfriends have scattered. Sheltered in the concession, I am fortunate to be unharmed, but with the evening clouds and spring trees, I am concerned about my sisters, displaced, with uncertain fortunes, which makes my heart turn a hundred times, and especially I miss Ying, who is closer than siblings.</p>
<p>Last night, Ying suddenly became an unexpected guest. I was extremely happy, almost thinking it was a dream. I looked at her carefully for a while, which surprised me, because her former rich and luxurious appearance had completely changed into a simple and plain style. I felt very strange, and quickly asked her,</p>
<p>(Ying, has your family also been blessed by the Japanese planes, and all your property has been wiped out?) She shook her head and said,</p>
<p>(No, my family was lucky to leave Shanghai a few days before the incident happened.) I said,</p>
<p>(Then where have all your previous colorful imported clothes gone?) She said with a guilty look,</p>
<p>(Alas, since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, I have received extremely stimulating lessons, and I deeply feel that my previous extravagant consumption was not only too uneconomical, but also a great absurdity because the money flowed out:) She took a sip of tea and said angrily,</p>
<p>(The small three islands, therefore, dare to be so rampant, relying on the achievements of their economic aggression over the years, creating many fierce cannons, but thinking about it carefully, aren't these fierce cannons indirectly funded with money by our compatriots who love to use imported goods? One mistake, how can we allow another? Therefore, I vow not to wear or use imported goods again. Moreover, in this time of national crisis, we should even more lie on firewood and taste gall, diligently and persistently promote the proposition of using domestic goods. Every thread and every strand should be domestic goods, so that we can plug the leaks and save this dying motherland. Don't just rely on verbal long-term resistance!)</p>
<p>After listening to Ying's words, I admired her courage to correct her mistakes. Now, without considering my humble knowledge, I have specially written it out to advise many fashionable sisters to wake up quickly.</p>

<p>Car News Special Commentary</p>
<h3>A Record of the Rise and Fall of Shanghai Vehicles Over the Past Thirty Years (Continued)</h3>
<p>In addition to rickshaws and automobiles, the increase in bicycles is also quite considerable. In 1925, there were only 9,817 bicycles in the Public Concession. By 1930, this number had increased to 21,530. In that year, the Public Works Department issued 730 permits for motorized bicycles. Trucks are an important tool for transportation and have progressed extremely rapidly over the years. Recently, Shanghai's construction industry has become increasingly developed, and the demand for trucks to transport materials has also been very large. In addition, there are two types of vehicles that rely solely on human power for transporting goods: handcarts and pushcarts. The following is a table comparing these three types of vehicles:</p>
<p>Handcarts　Pushcarts　Trucks</p>
<p>1915 6,777 vehicles 1,425 vehicles 2 vehicles</p>
<p>1920 9,136 vehicles 2,407 vehicles 151 vehicles</p>
<p>1925 11,688 vehicles 4,366 vehicles 583 vehicles</p>
<p>1930 10,530 vehicles 9,608 vehicles 1,333 vehicles</p>
<p>Among the means of transportation in Shanghai that are widely used by the public, in addition to rickshaws and handcarts, there are also trams and buses. Trams have been established for a long time, and their routes are like a network, making them convenient for passengers. Therefore, they occupy an important position in Shanghai's vehicular traffic. The Shanghai Electric Construction Company began operating trams in 1908. Initially, it signed a contract with the Public Works Department, with routes totaling 24 miles in length. The operating hours were from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM daily. The company's original concession was valid until 1940, with settlements made every seven years to determine whether to continue or terminate. However, both parties were required to give six months' notice. In 1924, the second treaty was renewed, and the tram company added trolleybuses in addition to operating trams. It also paid 5% of its total revenue as taxes to the Public Works Department. In 1930, the Public Works Department's annual revenue increased by 118,116 taels from this tax. In addition, trolleybuses paid two cents per vehicle-mile as a road maintenance fee. In 1930, this revenue amounted to 39,972 taels. At the end of last year, the Shanghai Electric Construction Company operated routes totaling 35 miles in length, half of which were trolleybus routes. The company had 201 trams and trailers, and 98 trolleybuses. In 1930, the vehicles traveled 9,708,937 miles, carrying a total of 128,564,955 passengers, who paid 4,000,000 yuan in fares. The total number of employees was 27,008, of whom 98% were Chinese.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned tram company, the China General Omnibus Company appeared in 1924. The taxes paid by the company to the Public Works Department were of two types: 1.5 cents of silver per mile for vehicles with pneumatic tires, and 1.75 cents of silver per mile for vehicles with solid tires. In 1930, the China General Omnibus Company paid 49,389 taels in taxes to the Public Works Department. The company originally had only 20 vehicles, but gradually increased this number to 125, with an additional 25 vehicles reserved for hire at any time. Currently, its routes are 45 miles long. In 1930, it traveled a total of 2,500,000 miles, carrying 130,000,000 passengers. The company employed nearly a thousand people.</p>
<p>The number of vehicles currently in the Public Concession is quite staggering.</p>
<h3>The above picture shows the interior of the new building built by the Buick Motor Company of America at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Avenue Albert. The scale and complete repair facilities are said to be the most modern in Shanghai.</h3>
<p>There are 120 buses, 299 trams, 7,000 automobiles, 20,000 rickshaws, 22,000 bicycles, 10,000 pushcarts, and 10,500 handcarts. The number of vehicles traveling on the roads each day is unknown. Therefore, managing traffic on the roads is a very difficult task. In 1930, 7,055 Chinese and 337 foreigners were penalized for traffic violations. There were 11,000 traffic accidents on the roads, resulting in 142 deaths and approximately 4,000 injuries.</p>
<p>To understand the congestion of vehicular traffic on the roads in the Shanghai Public Concession, consider the following example. On a certain Friday in October, between 11:45 AM and 12:15 PM, during the lunch break, there were the most vehicles on the roads. At the intersection of Szechuan Road and Nanking Road, there were 756 motorized vehicles passing through at that time. This includes automobiles, buses, trams, and motorized bicycles. 2,397 rickshaws passed through this intersection. From this, it can be seen that 25 automobiles, etc., and 80 rickshaws passed through the area every minute.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department has very strict procedures for issuing driver's licenses. Applicants, whether Chinese or foreign, must pass eye and ear tests, and then pass the examination at the Gordon Road station. Those who pass are only given a temporary license. This license is only valid for driving in the area north of Range Road, west of Carter Road, and east of Mouhai Road. The temporary license is renewed monthly until a full license is obtained. In 1930, 4,774 people obtained full licenses as car owners and drivers, and 1,642 as chauffeurs.</p>
<p>Anecdotes from Overseas</p>
<h3>Ode to Automotive Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Increased British Automobile Exports　The British automobile manufacturing market has recently seen a frequent increase in the number of automobiles exported to foreign countries. Sales in New Zealand are also better than before, and even American-made automobiles cannot compete with them. In 1931, Great Britain shipped a total of 2,414 automobiles to New Zealand, worth £272,285. The number shipped from the United States was 475, worth £59,975. A comparison of the two shows a vast difference. British automobile sales in Africa and Ceylon are also higher than those of American automobiles. The many local factors in Australia have had a significant impact on the automobile industry. However, British automobile imports increased by 50.7% in the first six months of 1931, compared to only 17% during the same period in 1930. Because of this, British automobile manufacturers are quite optimistic about the export business.</p>
<p>New Invention of Colored Tires　American tire manufacturers, seeing that the colors of existing tires are somewhat monotonous, have created colored tires using a new method, so that they can be coordinated with the color of the car body to enhance the appearance. In addition to the tread of these colored tires still being in natural color, the color of the sidewalls can be infinitely varied, complementing the car body. Moreover, the color is not limited to a single color. Any mottled patterns, stripes, and new-style three-dimensional designs can be created as desired, creating a unique spectacle.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the French Ford Factory　The number of automobiles manufactured by the French Ford factory last year, including passenger cars and trucks, totaled 13,000. In 1930, the factory manufactured 12,900 automobiles. However, the increase in profits last year was limited compared to the previous year. The net profit in 1931 was 36,000,000 francs, compared to 35,200,000 francs in 1920 and 34,536,000 francs in 1929. Therefore, the dividend will remain at 12.5%. The Ford automobiles manufactured in France are mid-range vehicles, priced between 20,000 francs and 30,000 francs. The prices of French-made two-cylinder or four-cylinder automobiles are only 12,000 francs and 18,000 francs, respectively.</p>
<p>Chrysler Builds New Factory　The American Chrysler automobile factory recently surveyed a new factory site of 27 acres in Los Angeles. Construction will begin as soon as the contract is signed. The number of workers needed is about several hundred, and the number of factory workers will increase further after completion. According to the current plan, the factory plans to manufacture 200 car bodies per day. The number of chassis is similar to the number of car bodies. In addition, there will be assembly, transportation, and repair departments, among other facilities.</p>
<p>News of Wood Replacing Gasoline　Germans have invented a bus that uses wood instead of gasoline as fuel. This bus has already been running between Hamburg and Bergedorf-Beramsdorf. It is said that it can save 85% of the cost of gasoline. The bus currently running on the above route has traveled over 7,000 miles and has not encountered any driving difficulties. The wood-burning equipment is installed separately behind the bus. After the wood is burned, it is converted into gas, which then starts the engine and drives forward. It is said that dry wood is better because it can produce a large amount of gas. According to the inventor, this type of bus that uses wood instead of gasoline can also use ordinary motorcycles without any problems, and fuel consumption can be reduced by 50%.</p>
<p>Buick's Old Car Service Does Not Decline　Any automobile that has been used for 25 years must be said to have a very long lifespan. The parts department in the Buick factory in Flint, Michigan, has a large collection of parts for old cars. The collection is very rich and widely used. Several months ago, a coppersmith from Georgia sent a letter to the factory, stating that the timing gear of his Model F Buick car had been damaged and requested a replacement. This car was a 1906 model. The factory eventually fulfilled his request and provided a replacement, which was restored to its original condition. Another person from North Dakota wrote to the factory, asking where his car was manufactured. After the factory staff checked his car number, they learned that his car was also a 1906 model.</p>
<p>Progress of British Motorcycles　The manufacturing of British motorcycles has recently made great progress. Sales have expanded, and there is a tendency to replace American goods. Subsequently, due to exchange rate factors and the excellence of their products, the number of orders for various factories has increased daily. Recently, the two police chiefs of Los Angeles and San Francisco in the United States also inquired about the special features of British motorcycles to prepare for their adoption. They inquired in particular about power and speed. It is said that British factories have manufactured a type of American-style motorcycle to meet this special need.</p>

<h3>Spark Plugs and Engine Appreciation</h3>
<p>Whether or not an engine operates efficiently depends on the quality of the spark plugs installed and whether they are suitable. This is an undeniable fact. If the spark plugs ignite too early or too late, it is impossible for the engine to operate efficiently. Conversely, if the spark plugs installed are well-matched to the engine, the spark plugs will ignite on time no matter what speed or how long the driving takes, so that the engine can obtain full benefit. In recent times, spark plug manufacturers, in view of this, have focused their attention and devoted all their efforts to improving their products. The Bosch spark plug factory is one of the earliest and largest spark plug factories in the world. The Bosch spark plugs produced by it are used in various engines in the land, sea and air, and all have achieved satisfactory results. The following is a brief description of its most prominent features for the reference and research of those who choose spark plugs.</p>
<p>1. Has 30 years of experience. The Bosch factory has been in operation for 30 years. It has used the research and experience in manufacturing and other aspects during these 30 years to work hard to progress. It is appropriate that it has made rapid progress.</p>
<p>2. Strict testing is extremely reliable. Bosch spark plugs equipped with pyranite insulators are individually and rigorously tested before they are completed. Among them, the tests such as 16,000 volts and 25 air pressure have been carried out more than 50 times. Only because the manufacture is cautious, is it absolutely reliable, and the drivers of cars, motorcycles and buses in the world are also absolutely trust it in any situation.</p>
<p>3. Absolutely no air leakage and longer life. No air leakage is another feature of Bosch plugs. Only because of this, the entire combustion pressure is applied to the piston, and each explosion is sufficient for full utilization. Furthermore, it is made of specially selected materials and is finely crafted, so it is durable and extremely economical. According to the itinerary, although it reaches 60,000 to 100,000 miles, the Bosch plugs are still pleasant and competent and do not need to be replaced.</p>
<p>4. Outstanding performance and numerous types. According to the engine of automobiles, flying boats, etc., that have won victory trophies, all are equipped with Bosch brand spark plugs. This is a truly noteworthy and interesting fact. Also, such as the engine of the Zeppelin airship, all are equipped with Bosch plugs to engage in each flight. As for various automobiles, whether they are European or American products, each has its most suitable Bosch plugs. It is because Bosch plugs are available in various styles, whether they are metric or American thread.</p>
<p>5. Easy to choose and available everywhere. If you want to avoid the disadvantages of early ignition of spark plugs, you must choose spark plugs whose thermal resistance is well matched to the engine. Bosch has seen this and made a simple table to indicate the size of its thermal resistance in numbers for easy selection. Car operators all over the world and thousands of Bosch service agencies are always stocked with a large number of products, which can be purchased everywhere, which is extremely convenient.</p>
