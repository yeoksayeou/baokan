<p>特委會休會至一月十六日再開</p>
<p>休會期間如調解基礎不能妥協</p>
<p>小國將請援用十五條第四節</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯大會之十九國委員會今晨十時三十六分開會、比代表胡白主席、旅經决定發一正式公報宣佈討論中日爭執經過後、即於十一時二十分休會、將至一月十六日重開、公報即於休會後發表、內稱、十九國委員會按照國聯大會十二月九日决議案所委任務、曾擬定若干文稿指陳調解兩國爭執之綱要基礎及其進行程序、此項文稿共有决議案草案兩件、與聲明理由書一件、均經由主席及國聯秘書長通知中日代表團、今雙方俱已提出意見、而此後之談話將須經歷若干時日、委員會處此環境之中、認爲必須繼續努力、俾可對於如斯嚴重之問題商得一種同意、故爲便利進行談話計、將會議展延至一月十六日爲最晚之期、</p>
<p>最後又謂委員會决定在與有關係各方面進行談話時　前述文稿暫不發表云云、</p>
<p>現聞倘中日兩國在一月十六日以前不能接受某種適宜之調解基礎、則小國將迫十九國委員會進行盟約第十五條第四節製成報告與建議此項報告與建議、毋須當事國之同意、</p>
<p>今日中代表顧維鈞對於委員會進行此案又需延滯月許、深表遺憾、（二十日國民電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會將休會至一月間、同時日代表與十九特委會主席及國聯秘書長間、將繼續談判、此間人士認爲希望尙未拋棄、當可覓得一種方案、以銷釋日本對於草案與理由說明書中某點之反對、而維持委員會以李頓報告書爲調解手續根據之意見、日內瓦輿情以爲中日兩國皆未表示完全不可退讓之精神、故料原文之稍經修改、當可使現所擬之調解手續開始進行、日本反對邀請美俄參加十九特委員襄助調解工作一節、亦可不成問題、蓋此兩國今皆未表示亟欲與聞此項爭執之頤意也、聞國聯秘書長德魯蒙在過去數日之談判中、甚爲活動、已籌出一方案、並已使日本不反對草案、惟日代表尙未完全接到關於此事之東京訓令、德魯蒙並將於數日内與各大國外交當局商榷此事、（十九日號透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會今已在無法進行之中蓋欲求　適中方案、爲中日雙方所能同時接受者、旣爲不可能、而欲維持國聯之威信尤屬萬難也、以現狀觀之無論十九國委員會或國聯大會均有不得不停止遠東事件討論之趨勢、而如何保留國聯之顏面、則惟有組織一小組委員會、將此無法挽救之局勢加諸其身、而圖卸責耳、若望其能於翌年一月間得一解决方法、亦屬畫餅充飢云、（十九日國民社電）</p>

<p>招致日內瓦不良印象</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據本社獲得之消息、十九國委員會對於當事國在最近所作談話中所表示之强硬態度似有不滿之印象而對於日本代表團之態度爲尤甚、蓋日本代表團對於向彼提出之各項建議、幾無不加以拒斥也、本社星期日所報告之消息、現已經證實、據該項消息、五人起草委員會竟至提議取銷决議案中關於不承認「滿洲國」之一節、以冀不致損及日本驕矜之心理、但十九國委員會對於建議承認「滿洲國」、則堅决拒絕、至目前爲止、談判所以失敗似由此點之爲梗、在此情勢下、十九國委員會中間已產生一種明晰之運動、即除已向當事國代表團一方或他方所提出之讓步以外、决不再行讓步是也、因此今晨委員會會議中、有兩國代表宣佈贊成維持决議草案之基本原則時、其餘各國代表均隱示同意、委員會當命主席以此項表示、通知有關各國、十九國委員會中多數代表均有一種感想、以爲調解工作不能在國聯會盟約第十五條第三節之範圍内獲得結果、即繼續努力、亦未必有濟於事、彼等似深信除非如各方所望、局勢將有突然之轉變、則至一月十六日會議工作重行開始時、十九國委員會當不得不設法採用十五條第四節之規定、依照該節應繕發一報告書、宣佈對於爭執事件之判斷云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 晦</p>
<p>㈠國際聯盟之無能</p>
<p>國際聯盟開會以來。荏苒遷延至於今日。「公道正義」「國際條約」。在日軍鐵手之下盡爲廢紙瀋陽事變。錦州砲擊。嫩江橋畔之血跡。北滿之被蹂躪。與夫淞滬之役二十億圓之財富頓化灰燼。即李頓調查團亦認九月十八日「事實上并未阻碍長春南下列車之準時到達。即就鐵路之損害本身而論。實不足以證明軍事行動之正當···」至於滿洲傀儡之構成。李頓調查團亦「認爲滿洲國之構成。雖有若干助成分子。但其最有力之兩種分子。厥爲日本軍隊之在場及日本文武官吏之活動···。」此種事實上之鐵證。日人竟加以否定。而美其名曰爲東亞和平。不幸國聯中之盟員。亦有陽抑而暗助之者。於是國際上之所謂「公道」。乃盡爲强力者所支配矣。我國民隱忍復隱忍。等待復等待。而隱忍等待之結果。國聯豈特無有實力可以裁制日本之暴行。丨去年九月三十日之决議案。竟自己推翻至於幷說話之勇氣而亦無之。遷就日本之所謂事實。以圖暫時之敷衍。</p>
<p>㈡日本又向東北增兵</p>
<p>敷衍之局其能長久乎。日本軍國主義者。以併吞東北三省而後即滿足乎。護之瀋陽事變之後。錦州未陷落之前。即知此事决非敷衍所能了結。東北三省尤難填滿帝國主義者之狂慾。</p>
<p>猶憶去年十二月十日國聯未派調查團之先。日軍侵佔東北者。僅有南滿路守備隊及仙台第二師團。龍山第二十師團。全數合計不過五萬。迄乎調查團東來而淞滬喋血。對東北三省且又增加弘前第八師團。姬路第十師團。宇都宮第十四師團以及鹿島·名古屋·久留米。東京各師團中之騎砲部隊。總計戰鬭兵員數逾十萬。以與我飢寒交迫爲民族爭最後生存之義勇軍相搏戰。馬·蘇·張·吳·各路義軍憑血肉之誠而與飛機鋼砲相抗。前有强敵後。無援兵。然而此種義憤之師。在一方面啓示後人。使知吾民不肯屈服於暴力。後起者當奮力雪恥。而另一方面則牽制日本使不敢西向。犧牲一片土以保全關內之完整殊不知疲弊之師。豈堪持久。馬蘇敗耗瀕傳。而日本增兵之警訊又至矣。</p>
<p>其名固曰爲替代仙台第二師團之交代兵也。其實彼第二師團僅一部分傷殘及應即退伍之部卒開回日本。其餘仍滯留東北境內。增加之部隊則爲熊本第六師團全部。而其目的地則在錦義及朝陽一帶。</p>
<p>㈢熱邊緊張山海關危急</p>
<p>日本旣對東北增兵。朝陽北票迭告危急。山海關方面又屢次挑衅。雖經和平解决。日人仍繼續造作僞證。借以擾亂灤東。而得閒進窺熱河。</p>
<p>就表面觀察此種推測似有神經過敏之嫌。且日人值此內外交迫之際。預算旣感不數。國聯復加製肘。焉能不顧一切。盲目侵略無如日閣以爲熱河在二十一條件當時即已劃定範圍。故動稱滿蒙。其意即包含東北三省及內蒙一帶。不過內蒙地廣人稀。非有現時十倍之兵力。難敷分配。且瀚海欄杆堅冰十丈。縱使我國當局仍繼續實行不抵抗主義。日本亦不能不顧忌草野民族英雄之突起。然在經濟上觀。熱河礦藏豐富。羊毛出產優良。幾爲我國之冠。此皆日本之所缺而朝夕圖謀攫取者也。况現時中俄已恢復邦交。雖所復者僅爲尋常的外交關係。吾輩固不望有意外之任何助力。而彼日人。則以爲設使中俄携手。日本在東北特權將根本動搖。故到處宣傳謂中國遍處赤化。如無日本從中維持。東亞和平將不能保。故英國聽之。美國惑之。今將更多一造作謠言之口實。且乘此美國舉措不定蘇聯急於自國建設之際乃將肆其野望。作更進一步之侵略。</p>
<p>㈣亟起圖存</p>
<p>東北旣全部淪陷。熱河灤東同時告急。現已忍無可再忍。讓無可再讓。或生或死。或存或亡。在此最後之一舉。自今而後。須實行國民總動員。立即施行徴兵制。實施强制勞動。使一盤散沙之人民。一變而爲有團結力之堅强的組織體。而幼穉之工業。尤不可不施行產業動員。以集體之力。圖謀軍事工業及一般工業之突飛的發展。奮全國人民之力。以爭民族最後之生存。庶乎可以自救。</p>

<p>在海軍方面有東鄕平八郞元帥統率一切、次之則有山本權兵衛齋藤實岡田啓介等左右扶持、尙可維繫其一貫的系統、而陸軍方面、山縣有朋而後、僅有田中毅一、田中死後、論資望當推宇垣一成、無如宇垣資望雖深、學識較差、手腕亦弱、故不能統帥陸軍全部、至陸軍分而爲三派、前陸軍大臣南次郎大將、金谷範三大將、鈴木莊六大將、中將級之中、則有阿部信行（現任台灣軍司令官）寺內壽一（第四師團長駐大阪）杉山元（第十二師團長駐九洲之久留米爲日本陸軍五個特大師團之一）林彌三吉（在鄕中將之領袖）等爲宇垣派之台柱、秦真次（憲兵司令中將）小磯國昭（駐滿關東軍參謀長丨中將）鍵川美次中將等、爲現在參謀次長真崎甚三郎派之健將、荒木（真夫）一派表面上雖似包容真崎、而擁荒木者上有武藤信義大將（現任關東軍司令）、中層將領中有永田鐵山少將、坂垣征四郎少將、石原莞爾大佐、橋本欽五郎中佐等少壯軍官、均欲積極擴大其對華軍事行動、以誇大其功績、於是發動在鄕軍人、慫動右傾團體之組織以爲借此提高民氣、殊不知其結果、適足以擾亂日本社會、致陷於不可救治之境地、日本右傾諸團體約可分爲三大派、第一類爲純粹的國家主義者、第二類爲國家主義而帶有若干近代思想之色彩者、第三類爲社會主義右派化而　、贊成軍國主義侵略、但附以解放勞苦工農羣衆之條件者也、茲將以上三者分述如下、</p>
<p>第一類發源於頭山滿所創始之玄洋社、其結社之始、適當明治維新之時、起初爲一種修養學問磨練身心之機關、旣乃變而爲浪人會、專事侵略中國、國家主義派之巨頭、除頭山滿之外、與其同事者有內田良平、實係該社之一健將、乃以內田爲中心而創設黑龍會、雖亦剽取若干社會政策方案、設立簡易食堂、辦理工人寄宿社、但力倡東西文化混合、闡揚東方文化、痛詆法治主議之偏頗、故主張發揮天皇主義之妙諦、改革現制度、解决勞資問題、振作尙武風氣、充實國防機關、於是柴德次郎有大民俱樂部、森健二有大正赤心團、石井三郎·小川平吉·立花小一郎大將、又創立皇道義會等等、名稱雖異、內容實同、縱橫俱樂部、在早稻田大學區內曾縱橫一時、以對付野佐學·大山郁夫·褚侯津南雄·等左翼學者之爭鬬爲尤甚、而日本大國粹會·關東國粹會·大和民勞會·新日本協會·赤化防止團等等、其第一任務、皆在於防止左傾思想之蔓延、標榜以皇室中心、打倒馬克斯主義、確立國家威權、滿蒙團·秋水會·大統社·大日本正義團、雖云反赤、而侵略東北、則較重於他、浪人會黑龍會直屬下之天行會·獨立靑年社、已由對外爭鬬、轉化成對内陰謀、秘密輸入軍火、計劃暗殺、至於大日本生產黨不過一種烟幕、而恢私會·明倫會·兩軍人社交團體、實爲上述各團體背後之指使者、不過此輩軍人多屬舊派、且地位甚高、與一般民衆相隔甚遠也、</p>
<p>第二類爲急進的國家主義團體、最初創立之團體爲「老壯會」、由大井憲太郎·大川周明·滿川龜太郎·中野正剛·高畠素之·島中雄三·等集結而成、其中有國家主義者、有社會主義者、有自由主義者、有軍人亦有舊黨、大化會之岩田、大行社之淸水、白浪會之辰川與大川固明協議之後、遂創立猶存會、以國民精神爲創造的革命、建設革命的大帝國、大川固明所領導之行地社、其意爲「則天行地」、踏襲猶存社所揭示綱領在於「日本改造法案一對日本現時之苟安、力加反對、於當世財閥深致不滿、故主張積極侵略滿洲、但須以侵略所得歸諸天皇、而由天皇下賜與臣民、自九一八事變之後、該社在東北異常活動、因與軍部聯絡金融資本家之政策衝突、排斥在東北之日本財政資本之發展、大川因此在大連被拘、行地社之活動、亦受打擊、岩田富美夫之大化會、淸水行之助之大行會、辰川靜夫之白浪會、大杉精市之東海聯盟等、皆由猶存社解散後發生、其綱領細則雖各不同，而實質則大體相似、東興聯盟一新會·全日本與國同志會·大邦社·士林莊·國民戰綫社·神武會·等精神雖不一貫、實質雖互異、而其大體上之意識、與行地社如出一轍、神武會且由大川任會長、此派在軍人團體中有小櫻會·櫻會·洋洋會·皆爲中下級軍官之社交團體、與之發生直接關聯、故軍部巨頭亦有往來、而國本社之平召騏一及菊池武夫中將、亦屬於此類、</p>
<p>第三類國家社會黨、爲日本右翼諸黨中之急進派、共領導人物、亦由社會民衆黨方面轉化而來、如赤松克磨爲該派工人實際運動家、近藤榮藏林葵未夫等爲該派之理論家、平野力三則領導農民組織、其理論雜誌有「國家社會主義」、農村運動尙有長野朗爲實際的指導、蓀權成卿作理論的爭鬬、形成時間雖短、羣衆勢力雖薄、而在右傾諸團體中則較爲活動、</p>
<p>上述日本右傾團體情形、誠不免簡略、但大體上已略具備、從此亦可窺知其右翼團體內部之複雜也、設使軍部不從中作祟、其對内爭鬬、將大過對外侵略矣、（十二月十四日寄自東京）</p>

<p>短領振麥仍須續訊</p>
<p>安徽旅滬同鄉會告發皖北放賑舞弊一案、所有第一被告楊樹誠被訴阻運賑麥·以麥變價·將麥化粉·等三欵、業已審查完竣、第二被告全紹武被訴各欵中之第一欵停放五河縣急賑、訉至半途、因須查吊賑票等證據、暫予中止進行、先審第二欵、掯不發放盱眙縣賑麥七十五噸、而亦未審竣、昨日午後、又由第一特區地方法院吳廷琪推事開庭、原告皖同鄉會代表李振亞等·被告楊樹誠·全紹武·王範五·查良釗·證人五河代表陳率真·盱眙代表談紹華·及兩造律師、均租繼到案、惟所傳之見證霍炳珩、因在北平、故未到案、而國府救濟水災委員會以本案甚屬重要、特命該會法律顧問出庭旁聽、吳推事當以賑票旣經吊到、遂宣告仍審究、</p>

<p>於是全紹武之律師卽將賑票四冊呈案、謂此係五月二十九·六月一日·及六月二日·之賑票、上蓋有五河縣商會主席趙蘭階·五河縣黨委劃律初騐訖之圖章、所填日期、亦皆與被告前次提出五月二十九日賑票存根上之圖章日期相同、原告前以該項票根、係屬僞造、任意攻擊、今則足堪證明矣、庭上乃將該賑票擲交陳率真閱看、並詢其復有何說、陳稱圖記雖係真實、但五河縣政府致我之公函、則言·此項圖章、乃六月九日以後始用、何以五月二十九等日之賑票上、蓋有此戳、殊不可解、原告之律師、因亦將該賑票逐面詳閱之下、聲稱票上所填人名與日期之筆跡、頗多粗細不勻、故此種賑票之日期、可斷言係事後填寫、庭上卽</p>
<h3 id="c149">質以何所根據 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>該律師答稱、五河停賑事件、五月二十九日尙在蚌埠調停、而其時查放員霍炳珩復不在五河、且賑票若係出於一人填寫、則筆跡更不致粗細不勻、况票上洞眼頗多、可以測知該票裝釘、已非一次、凡此各點、關係自訴人利益、應請審判長注意、吳推事遂宣稱本院察核賑票與票根、均係真實、不能以其中一二紙偶有筆跡不勻、竟認爲僞造、自訴人倘必以係僞造、自應確切證明若僅一味空言、則近於吹求、且賑票與</p>
<h3 id="c150">票根完全相同 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>猶云不足信、而五河縣事後之公函、更難取信、原告律師李時蕊卽起而鄭重聲稱、貴推事對於安徽正式官廳之官文書、猶不認爲與原告有利益之證據、甚屬遺憾、自訴人自今日起、始發現貴推事審理本案有偏頗之虞、依法請求貴推事廻避、吳推事遂論以聲請迴避、依法當用書狀爲之、在未具狀之前、仍應照常審理、隨傳原告代表李振亞至案、詢之曰、被告提出之賑票上蓋驗訖圖章、核與陳率真提出之圖章、完全相同、並據陳率真供認圖章、確屬同相、而本院詳察亦無異點、是五月二十九日查放急賑一事、就賑票與票根而論、當係事實、爾屢次供稱票根乃係僞、究竟有何根據、李聞諭　稱前次並未肯定言係僞造、但證以五河縣公函、該項圖章、當係六月九日以後方用、吳推事因復諭之日、五河公函、係事後所出、自應以</p>

<p>今就所提出之賑票推斷、不獨五月二十九日曾經查放、而六月一二日亦已有查放工作、此乃事實、不難水落石出、並仍將該項賑票擲與李閱、李遂連稱實在莫明其妙、審至此、庭上諭令續　掯不發放盱眙七十五噸賑麥事件、原告律師先將安徽同鄉會前日（十九）所接盱眙縣政府巧電一通呈案、謂全紹武上次提出該縣前任縣長王聲蘭所出三百噸賑麥之印領、現經該縣電復否認、則</p>

<p>已由此電證明、吳推事旋向盱眙代表談紹華詳詢領麥經過、據談稱衹領到二百二十五噸、其餘七十五噸、係卸在明光、爲汪雨相領去汪乃全所委之人、質之全紹武供、汪領該麥時、由汪與明光商會主席李祝熙出有收據、前已呈案、緣其時盱眙方遭匪患、該縣賑麥、須分南北兩部散放、故此七十五噸、遂卸於明光云云、全之律師並聲明原告旣以盱眙縣所出之三百噸印收、係屬僞造、則請飭令原告提出二百二十五噸之印收、否則彼殊無以圓其說、庭上乃向李振亞訉問有無二百二十五噸之印收、李則無以應、時已薄暮、吳推事宣告退庭、本案展期再訉、</p>

<p>——原函見本月十七日本欄</p>
<p>姜存松君訊：㈠對付公安局的辦法、積極的辦法是同業聯合起來、要求黨部予以援助、務冀達到懲辦該敲詐人民的公安局的目的。消極的辦法是向輿論界呼籲，請加一致援助。㈡謀生問題、可要求當地人士開一會議、討論救濟辦法、如此項請求、不得要領、自然衹有各謀生路；假使正當職業亦找不到、則儘管「明目張膽」的仍操舊業、國家旣不給飯你們吃、還管他什麼法不法？倘因此而被官廳逮捕、則大家一起去坐牢、反正有飯吃的。總之、如果人人不畏縮、齊心一致、沒有不會得到最後勝利的！</p>
<p>陳穎傑君訊：我是一個失學的靑年，從前在中等學校肄業過；後來因爲家庭的頑固，强迫輟學，當時我爲上達好學心驅使、也曾作强有力的反抗，但終因心長力短，俯首就範，從嚴命迫令就商，然於我性情，逈不相同，是以興趣索然，毫無生氣。但是我的求知心，仍不稍減，當在業餘晨昏，伏案攻讀，書報雜誌，尤樂瀏覽。越數年，蒙友人之薦，任職於學界，因認真堅苦之結果，其蒙校方倚重，迄今已四年餘。惟年來因社會失業者日多，人浮於事，卽區區小學飯盌,人有奪不到手之槪，本人在今年，不幸亦在被擯之列。爲此在精神上，物質上，均發生恐慌，毫無辦法，竟流爲一失學失業之可憐人。每託友人覓一工讀機會，均不可得。照現在現象，做事定要講「資格」，而資格又非「金錢」買不到的！那末我旣少金錢，亦缺資格，將來如何立足社會呢？不平的社會，不幸的人生，請先生來給我一個光明的指示！</p>
<p>覆：足下的奮鬬精神，我們是極表同情。「資格」問題，確是現代許多失學靑年所共同感受到的一種痛苦。我們平心而論，資格之限制，乃所以防登進之濫，間接即所以保持辦事效能之齊一，並非只問「資格」，不問「實學」，原意本未可厚非；　不過普通人往往只重資格虛名，不究實際，資格的價值，就根本失掉了。其實，依我們看，目下的資格限制，也得有限。你看有多少沒有資格的人，靠他赤手空拳的奮鬭，也一樣獲得了相當的成功；更有多少旣沒有資格又沒有實學的人，靠他親戚故舊的「提拔」，居然也會身躋「貴顯」。資格的限制在那裏？不過騙騙一班窮小子而已丨我們固然不願學着後一班人去「拍馬鑽營」，前一種人的奮鬭精神，確是值得做我們模範的丨所以，在這裏我們所能貢獻的，就衹有「奮鬭」兩字。社會不平嗎？我們要奮鬭！人生不幸嗎？我們要奮鬭丨「人定可以勝天」，我們要以不斷的努力，去打破目前一切的困難：我不相信目前一切的黑暗，可以至終壓服了我們有勇氣的靑年！光明就在前面，我們往前衝吧！</p>
<p>丁介安君訊：㈠我們生在這種混濁社會中，外界的誘惑和壓迫，如此其厲害，怎麼樣繼能保持我們的人格，不與流俗同化？㈡人生總不免有憂患痛苦的時候，這種境遇輪到頭上，怎樣可以使自己不頹喪？㈢我們要做成一種事業或學問，中間一定要經過許多曲折困難，怎樣纔能不半途退縮？</p>
<p>覆：來函所問，雖分三項，而其原因，則衹有一點，就是個人「意志」問題。一人果有極堅强的意志，無論什麼困難的打擊和罪惡的誘惑，都不會使他屈服；反之，一人果無意志，就一切無從談起，終其身衹有隨波逐流而巳。决不會有什麼成功的！至於意志之養成，當然要靠自己的修養。平日每逢一事到手，都該先加以一番精細的觀察，判斷牠的是非，是非旣定，就當抱定勇氣去進行，無論面前有什麼困難，都置之不管。這種偉大的勇氣，就是「意志」。要有這種勇氣，第一，對於宇宙人生的真際，要認得淸楚，第二，對於利害觀念，要有嚴正的判別；普通說起來，就是要「眼光遠大」。眼光短小的人，决計不會有什麼「意志」的。再歸納起來，意志的解釋，就是「不怕」「不惑」。一人能夠「不怕」「不惑」，也就可以應付一切了。</p>

<p>丨約翰敗在攻者不能守丨</p>
<p>丨東吳勝西靑（乙組）丨</p>
<p>賴其敏捷之身段、出其純熟之球藝、滬江健兒乃得以五十七比三十五之結果、勝約翰籃球隊於昨日西靑甲組賽中、其時一百有餘之滬江男女同學、環坐四周、歡呼喊吶、此唱彼和、其樂殆不可言獎、賽後、繼之乙組東吳對西靑、結果東吳四十二比二十七勝、上半時東吳以十九比十六占先、</p>

<p>約翰滬江、籃球界中、東西對頭、近年約翰健將、相率離校、實力較遜、滬江則反是、兵精糧足、不可一世、劇戰開場、心存燥急、手不從命、非過卽不及、罰球之聲頻聞、壯士爲之膽寒、陳祥龍第一犯規、滬江孫寳慶首中一分、滬江陶祖柟繼之、一犯再犯、錢敬鏞亦獲一分、反手之間、滬江誠景星奇兵出關、斜道射籃、陳祥龍匹馬入陣、俟其下　、單背托入、滬江軍心鎮定、聲勢浩大、扶搖直下、不十分鐘、卽以十一比二領前</p>
<h3 id="c201">得心應手 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>轉戰至此、駕輕車、就熟路、雙方籃中球如流星穿入、不如前之累投不中、蓋燥急之念已去、乃具得心應手之妙、幾乎一分一秒之間、均各有建樹之機、相較之下、約翰如得一球滬江必隨之報復、而有時息上加利、約翰三前鋒均善射籃、加以內衛孫寳慶亦贊助甚力、無形之中、滬江已占上風、上半時告終、滬江二十七、約翰十四、</p>
<h3 id="c202">功成身退 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>上場再戰、約翰大爲出色、全軍打成一片、攻守相應、以前約翰之敗、病在前鋒不能內顧、內衛吳幼良陶祖柟責任加重、往往以二人之力、合拒五虎之活動、吳陶之功、遂爲全隊之冠相戰未久、陶氏首立奇功、中一球罰一球、而侯學敏又繼獲二分五分已得、約翰氣象萬千、勝利可望、正於其時、陶氏以四次見罰出場、在陶氏功成身退、可告無愧、而全隊則銳氣漸衰、挽救乏術、</p>

<p>滬江特殊之點三　盤迅速擲投準確、合作佳　、約翰不及者卽在此、顧有時雖將接近、不　　又漸告離者何地、藝術有高下也、當初十分鐘時、約翰所獲之球數、與較多於滬江、久而久之、滬江憑錢、無往不利連疊上升、分數牌上、乃大相懸殊　結果滬江五十七比三十五勝、裁判員舒鴻李祖祺</p>

<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>「不餓嗎，那麼個男兒漢吃這麼一些。」</p>
<p>「不餓。你怎麼會獨自個兒在這兒的呢？」</p>
<p>「一家子全死完咧」丨她眼皮兒一紅，又想哭啦。我趕忙不做聲，過了回兒，等她好了，我才說道：「怎麼呢？」</p>
<p>「他們打仗，把我們一家子全打完咧。」</p>
<p>「你到　兒去呢？」</p>
<p>「我能到那兒去呢？」</p>
<p>「你打算逃那兒去？」</p>
<p>「我沒打算往那兒逃，帶了幾個饝饝，一跑就跑到這兒來啦。你呢？」</p>
<p>「我連糧食也沒帶，沒呌大兵給打死，還是大運氣，那能打算往那兒跑？跑到那兒算那兒罷咧。」</p>
<p>那時候兒我和她越坐越近了，我手一擺，碰了她的手，我一笑，很不好意思的挪了挪身子。</p>
<p>「你還是坐遠點兒吧？」</p>
<p>我便挪開些，老遠的對坐著說話兒。</p>
<p>時候可真不早了，天上的星密得利害，你擠我，我擠你，想把誰擠下來似的，凉亭外面的草全在露水裏濕着，遠處幾　倒生的樹向月亮伸着枝幹。一陣陣風吹過來，我也覺得有點兒冷。亭子外邊兒一支夜鳥呌了一聲兒，那聲氣夠怪的，像鬼哭，呌人心寒，接着就是　陣風。她把脖子一縮，哆嗦了一下。我瞧了她一眼。</p>
<p>「你還是坐過來些吧？」她說。</p>
<p>「你冷嗎？」</p>
<p>「我害怕。」</p>
<p>我挪過去貼着她坐下了。我剛貼着她的身子，她便一縮道：「你不會丨」瞧着我</p>
<p>我搖了搖頭。</p>
<p>她便靠在我身上道：「我累了」！</p>
<p>就閉上了眼。</p>
<p>我瞧着她，把我的疲乏，把我的寂寞全丟了。我想，我不是獨自個兒活在世上咧，我是和她一同地在這亭子裏丨我們是兩個人。</p>
<p>第二天起來，她有了焦紅的腮帮兒，散了的眉毛，她眼珠子裏的處女味昨兒晚上給賊偷了。她望了望天，望了望太陽，又望了望我，猛的掩着臉哭了起來。我不敢做聲，我知道自家做錯了事。她哭了好一回，才抬起腦袋來，拿手指指着我的鼻子道：「都是你」！</p>
<p>我低下了腦袋。</p>
<p>「你說不會的。」</p>
<p>「我想不到。」</p>
<h3 id="c269">「雅」與「俗」 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 杜衡</p>
<p>近來在文藝作品裏流行着一種多量的使用粗俗語的風氣，好像非此不足以表示平民化似的。這裏所謂粗俗語，當然特別是指那句要穿涉到女子的某一器官上去的罵人話，即上海話的『倷（讀若那）娘』以及各地同　句話的種種支衍。本來，爲傳述口語的神情起見，適當的用上幾句，也不但是可以，而且是應該的；但是用得過量，甚至敘述裏用，描寫裏用，詩歌裏都用，那便無形之中成爲一種提倡。這種提倡，縱然說不了怎樣特別要不得，但至少也像提倡『國粹』一樣的沒有什麼特別要得吧。　　用『倷娘』這一類話來罵人，漸漸的在罵者已經不以爲是一種怎樣重大的侮辱，而被罵者似乎也可以泰然處之。於是罵兒子而實際上等於不罵的也有，罵同胞兄弟而不覺得『亂倫』的也有，更漸漸地這罵也根本不成其爲罵，牠僅僅被當作一種口頭上的驚嘆記號，用來加重語氣。這實在是由於我們的大衆口語字彙缺少一個可以拿作加重語氣用的字眼。一件東西可以壞到『倷娘』的程度，同時也可以好到『倷娘』的程度：這假使還是罵，那簡直是無的放矢了。總之，這已經成爲一個有聲音而沒有意思的字句了。</p>
<p>在大衆口語裏常用這些話的確是普遍，可是我們也覺得倒並不一定句句話裏要挾上一個；即使句句話裏都要夾上一個的人也有，但究竟不是多數。最多用的還得首推我們的作家。其原故，大槪是爲了我們的作家覺得這些話非常觸耳，因此總把牠當作大衆口語裏唯一的特徵而抓住了。</p>
<p>跟『俗』相對的是『雅』，出口最雅我覺得應算是北平人。</p>
<p>這雅，一半也就是禮貌。的確，凡是到過北平菜館子的人，都一定會想像中國是最有禮貌的民族吧。然而這菜館子式的禮貌，也許不是純粹的禮貌，其中還含有『小賬』氣息，不很靠得住。那麼我可以舉一個旁的例。</p>
<p>譬如說，一輛有座客的洋車要趕上一輛沒有座客的洋車去，那麼車夫嘴裏便說『勞駕』丨至於後面的人撞了前面還要罵前面的人『勿生眼睛』那一類的事情，却大槪是沒有的。</p>
<p>『勞駕』是北方一句很普遍的口語，然而很雅。要用不大雅一點的字眼就沒法子說；勉强說，那就是『有勞你的車駕』。駕·從馬，中國古時通行的是馬車，可見這句話由來非一朝。託你辦一件事情，那便得請你坐了你的馬車去辦，多客氣。</p>
<p>洋車夫嘴裏的『勞駕』當然也可以解作『有勞你的車駕』，然而從駕字　馬這一點上看，那麼這句客氣話也就成爲决不下於『倷娘』那樣的侮辱。洋車夫不想到『勞駕』云者，是呌人坐馬車，不是呌人像馬似的『駕』着車那樣　『勞』法。因此，這個雅的字，可以說也跟那個俗的字一樣的被人衹記得聲音而忘記意思了。</p>
<p>我們理想的語文是旣不用『勞駕』來代替『請讓開』，也不用『倷娘』來代替丨代替什麼呢？</p>
<p>代替一切。</p>

<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>鮑喬（Poggis），意大利十四世紀諷刺家，生於一三八○年　所著有諧謔小話一卷，體裁頗似我國之笑林廣記，調侃教士，文人·貴婦·豪商，殊爲簡永。頗有猥談，而不狎褻。文學上自有此種別才，在英則爲司惠夫特（Ww＇it，在法則爲伏爾德（Voltaire),爲拉布萊（Rabelais，在我國則湖上李漁，差可此擬。今抄譯鮑氏小話數則，以餉讀者。</p>
<p>一位貴婦人，她底丈夫是做公使的，出門了好久。一天，一個郵差去問她有沒有信捎給她丈夫，她回答道：「你呌我怎麼能寫信呢，我丈夫把他的筆帶走了，衹　了個空墨水壺在家裏。」</p>
<p>有一個住在莒瓢城裏的人，名字呌做約翰，他很煩悶，因爲想不出一個方法來偵察他的妻子究竟有無外遇。後來，他絞盡腦汁，才想出一條妙計來。他自宮了！這樣以後，如果他妻子再會得生出孩子來，那麼她一定是犯姦了。</p>
<p>在卑爾果拉鄕村裏，有一個山裏人將要和他的一個鄰舍家的姑娘結婚了，但是他仔細考察了一番之後，他推說那位姑娘太嬌弱太年輕，不要了。可是她那呆笨的父親却回說：「她已經長成得教你不相信呢，事實可以證明，她已經替我們教區裏的那個教士生過三個孩子了呢。」</p>
<p>米蘭王子巴那波，極好女色。一天，他正在御花園裏的一個隱僻的地方，和　個他所寵愛着的女子調情。不意來了一個教士，一個聽懺悔詞的教士，因爲他智慧明睿，經驗豐富的緣故，他有自由接近王子的權利。巴那波頓時臉紅起來，覺得十分窘迫。可是他立刻就想出一句險惡的話來問那教士：「倘若你也有這樣一個女士在你床上，你將怎麼樣？」那教士立刻回答道：「我自然很明白我該怎麼樣，可是我不知道我會怎麼樣。」這回話就平息了王子底困惱。</p>
<p>一個弗勞侖斯人，出門在外。年底才回家，他妻子正在分娩。於是他疑心妻子不貞了。他就去詢問一個富有經驗的鄰家老嫗，天下有沒有懷孕十二個月才生產的孩子。那老嫗回答道：「自然有的，倘若尊夫人在受孕的那一日曾經看見過一頭驢子，她便得懷胎十二個月才生產，像驢子一樣。」丈夫聽了此話，居然相信，十分感謝老嫗，解釋了他底疑慮，免得妻子出醜，他終於欣然地做了那孩子的父親。</p>
<p>弗勞侖斯有一少婦，痴獃　絕，分娩時，嬰孩久不出。助產婦秉一燭檠。爲之探視，婦呻吟曰：「那邊也看一看，因爲我丈夫有幾回是在那邊工作的。」</p>

<p>在開幕伊始的轟轟烈烈的救濟東北難民游藝大會對面一座洋樓的一間小房間裏，　　着和平幽靜的空氣。桌子上攤滿了花花綠綠的書本子。壁上貼着醒目動人的標語，掛着五色繽紛的畫片和郵票，都帶着些異國的情調。不錯，它們原是從異國他鄕，海角天涯來的。一種優美悅耳的語聲，不是國語，不是英語，不是東洋話，也不是任何國語言，接連地傳入耳鼓。面上帶着，希望的幾十個靑年熙來攘往地流覽着各種異樣的書報。此外觸於眼簾最堪注意的，便是五角的綠星徽章。</p>
<p>這便是上海，也許是中國，第一次舉行的世界語展覽會！</p>
<p>凡是踏進這間屋子的人，總該感到那裏充溢着一種世界意識，和平氛圍。當那莊嚴的，LaEpero"「希望」歌聲由留聲機裏流露出來的時侯，聽的人　暫時把那擾攘紛爭的世界忘了，而憧憬着一個「天下一家」的烏托邦。</p>
<p>會場中值得注意的是正中壁上掛着的一方鏡框，裏面裝着的盡是些焦黑的碎紙片，幾行隱隱約約的字跡還可以辨得出是世界語文丨原來這是戰神所留給我們的紀念品呀。它們告訴我們：積月累年的我們的Eoperantisioj的努力，跟其他一切，在戰神的淫威之下，遭了同樣的命運。</p>
<p>第二件值得注意的事是：在該會所陳列的世界語書報中，日本和戰後新興國家，如蘇聯·</p>
<p>波蘭·捷克等的出和版物佔了很大的部分，而咱們本國的世界語刊物竟如鳳毛麟角：這或許是他們舉行這次展覽會的動機之一吧。</p>
<p>凡是到場而把各種書報翻看的人，總能見到海外勞動界的活躍吧。返觀國內，便只有嘆息。希望從事世運的同志們以後能分些力量在這方面活動。</p>
<h3 id="c272">四大作家電賀高爾基 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 宜閑</p>
<p>蘇聯最偉大的文學家高爾基於一八九二年開始他的文學生涯，到今年適屆四十週年紀念，蘇聯政府爲表揚他對於革命的偉大的貢獻起見，於本年九月二十五日舉行盛大的慶祝會，各國著名的作家去電致賀者很多，茲選譯蕭伯訥等四大作家的賀電如下。</p>
<p>蕭伯訥</p>
<p>有着越過國境的作品的作家數目很少，但高爾基却是其中的一個。在革命前的十九世紀，俄國作家足以感動英國人的心者，最早是屠格涅甫和托爾斯泰，隨後是杜思托益夫斯基，最後是高爾基和柴霍甫這幾個中間，只有高爾基使革命似乎成爲可能的事了</p>
<p>別的作家產生了對於社會，國家和人物的紛繁的印象，那種社會是壓根兒糟糕的，那種人物不是奢華得比大彼得，和卞撒林第二時代的宮臣們還奢華，便是　例如在柴霍甫的小說和劇本中的）無聊得比起和櫻桃園相類的英美人作品裏可以遇到的什麼人物來還無聊。他們似乎全然不能製造出應當比亞美利加還進步，比柏林巴黎或倫敦還文明的一種革命來。</p>
<p>高爾基的俄國寫照，的確沒有過份：他比其他的作家（他們都可以算是紳士作家）更明白俄國的底層　那寫照雖然黑暗些，可是作爲無產階級的文學作品，牠的真實性却具有紳士作家的小說裏所缺乏的質素，那班紳士作家是只有使周圍的事象羅曼斯化這一種本領的。</p>
<p>絕望這事情因他而消失了。高爾基所描寫的俄國無產階級是齷齪，嗜酒，殘暴，無知的，正同各處極窮的人們一樣；然而他們在本身的事業裏却也是切實的。他們並不無聊，他們有着將「生」握緊的力，而沒有一點令人氣短的無聊，這一種無聊是紳士作家從他們的無聊經驗裏取來，寫進一切事情中間去的。</p>
<p>總而言之，因爲他們有着革命在他們的中間，所以高爾基的書是黎明的書，不是判决日的書。我只有從譯本上領略到高爾基的作品，只有從短促的，但是也很親切的兩回會見上，認識了高爾基本人，我想我所能說的關於他的話就是這樣罷了。</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭</p>
<p>我致親切的祝賀於麥什謨高爾基。我願他再活許多年，中　地引導蘇聯及全世界的無產階級思想。</p>
<p>高爾斯華綏</p>
<p>我有機會來對偉大的作家麥什謨高爾基表示我的景慕，覺得欣幸的很。人類的中間竟有着這樣的名氏，而他的全集在數國也刊行了，我這麼一想，不由得高興起來了。</p>
<p>辛克萊</p>
<p>建造這樣的一個國家罷，這國家裏一切工人都是高爾基模樣的人　祝賀他，祝賀貴國。</p>

<p>「外面呌的？」</p>
<p>「不。少奶奶親手做的。她說你頂喜歡吃這個麵」。</p>
<p>海泉聽見，更覺得對不住她了。因爲今早上自己對她，實在是太過於小孩子脾氣了。</p>
<p>「那個日本佬是怎樣的人，你知道麼？」</p>
<p>他此刻禁不住要問娘姨了。</p>
<p>「誰曉得。那個日本佬喝酒喝得真厲害。日本正宗酒，每天要兩三升丨」</p>
<p>「到底做些什麼事體的，那個日本佬？」</p>
<p>「每天只是喝酒，喝了酒便打瞌睡。有時候一點也不客氣，就歪靠在少奶奶的床上睡下去了。」</p>
<p>海泉聽見，又起了一陣近似妒妬的憤恨。</p>
<p>「······」</p>
<p>但他忍耐著，不便說什麼話了。</p>
<p>「聽說是送那個日本小姑娘來上海找事體做的······」</p>
<p>「在日本沒有事體做，就都趕到上海來麼」？</p>
<p>海泉笑了一笑，把那大碗麵吃完了。</p>
<p>（十一）</p>
<p>鶴子夫人出去了後的曾公館，在海泉，真像冰窖那樣的冷。海泉再坐不住了，便一個人走出來，想到法國公園去走走。他准備搭車了。</p>
<p>立在下橋側，等了有一刻多鐘的時辰，還不見有公共汽車駛來。他又想，不去也算了，還是回家去關起門來睡一覺吧，等到七點多鐘便到北四川路去會卓女士。他正在沉思，不提防有一個人從後面走來，拍他的肩背。</p>
<p>「老林丨」</p>
<p>海泉翻過頭來看，原是一個在C大學教育科肆業的同鄕曹世光。</p>
<p>「啊丨你到那兒去」？</p>
<p>海泉和曹世光握了一回手，問他。</p>
<p>「到聖公會教會去」。</p>
<p>「今天又不是禮拜日，并且下半天了，到教會去做什麼」？</p>
<p>海泉雖然知道曹世光和聖公會教會有些關係，但不明白他在此刻到教會去的理由。</p>
<p>「老哥，老實告訴你吧。丨丨對第二個，我是不會說的。丨丨還不是爲吃飯問題？我當了教會哈巴牧師的秘書了，每天不論上下午，規定要到教會去一趟，替那個老番查看由各地方寄來的中文信，要答覆的替他寫回信。······苦差事，苦差事！」</p>
<p>曹世光說着，苦笑了一陣。</p>
<p>「那還不好？有意外的收入。」</p>
<p>「只是這個數目」。</p>

<h3 id="c274">生意興隆 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>時令一到，冬季大减價又熱鬧很久了。「大賤賣」「買一送一」的旗幟在馬路中心興高采烈的飄揚，摩登男女春風滿面一包一包的從大商店中挾出來，坐上汽車，揚長而去。無一不是生意興隆，無一不是太平景象。而且什麼團什麼團現已絕跡，可見出賣的又無一不是真正老牌國產，更可證明大老闆的愛國之心，確是不敢後人。所以，中國真是有望了。</p>
<p>但是，報紙上却也有一段這樣的消息，我爲了要相信我並不是頭暈目眩，於是我謹恭而敬之照抄如下：</p>
<p>『自十月分起，日貨進口，最爲擁擠。近日聞中俄復交，俄國貨將暢銷來華，邇日更加趕裝來滬。昨日阿蘇丸輪進口，運到劣貨一萬八千六百餘件，其中以疋頭機件紗廠用品瓷器砂糖等爲大宗，比較擁到時猶增加三分之一之儎脚。在本月十九日，二十日，二十四日，二十七日，三十日，尙有三笠丸筑波丸六甲丸摩耶丸等，有劣貨五大批約六七萬件，儘本月底趕到上海。</p>
<p>當然，這是一很有味的消息，尤其是與現在的熱鬧市場兩相對照起來，更爲有趣。而且於此可見中國人民的購買力早已足足有餘，不但本國貨不敷應用，即劣貨亦有供不應求之勢。於是我疑心上海並沒有打仗，而且中國更無所謂「國難」。反之·「國難」一次，便有如次好現象，所以，「國難」一事，正是多多益善，不妨年年國難，一直到全中國都是「大拍賣」「大犧牲」。</p>
<p>最後我要說：「哼丨生意興隆，中國真是有救了。」</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3 id="c275">電鐘 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 夷</p>
<p>要各地的時間統一，要許多時鐘表示同一時刻，這個難題，不是很困難而解决嗎？雖則；大家都是應用彈簧鐘，但是牠的速度，時常或速或遲，所以在以前我國的各大都市，在每日的午刻，鳴砲爲號的，一這就呌午砲丨，使全得市城的居民較準時刻，可是隔了許多之後，各個的鐘錶，往往總有多少參差，因此要解决這個難題，必需要裝置電鐘的必要啊丨</p>
<p>電鍾的搆造，電鐘是利用電流迴轉鐘針的裝置。牠的主要部分，大槪是電磁石和齒輪。牠的搆造，大槪中央是有齒輪，在齒輪的下方則有鈎，在齒輪的上方，那是有電磁石，磁石的一端附近則有一軟鐵片，這軟鐵片是和鈎互相連結的。當電磁石吸引軟鐵片的時候，則鈎動，齒輪也隨之而轉動。鐵片復舊則齒輪被鈎鈎住而不動。齒輪的軸更裝置幾個齒輪和其他的齒輪，互相嚙擦，最初齒輪迴轉的速度和最後齒輪的迴轉速度與鐘的秒針分針時針的迴轉速度，都是一致的。所以牠的速度，沒有參差和遲速的。每隔三十秒向電磁石能電流一次，那麼每個齒輪應之而迴轉。各齒輪的軸上，裝置時針分針和秒針，所以能夠指示時刻和彈簧鐘一樣的。這就是大槪搆造電鐘的情形。</p>
<p>電鐘的用處，因電鐘的時刻，皆是表示一致的，所以能使我們遵守時刻，不致於失約友人。故凡在學校，公園，宮廳，病院，工場，各大商店，各大旅館，以及其他的公共場所，和十字馬路口，都應當要裝置電鐘，這練可以俾得全市城的住民，就能時時知道統一的準確的時刻了。</p>

<p>「爸！母親呢？」六歲的敏，這幾天總這樣底問她父親。但她父親的回答，終只一句話，「出去了。」</p>
<p>母親有時是出去的，但至多不過出去二三天，就回來的。爲怎麼現在一連好幾天，還不見母親回來？這一個疑問，在敏小的心靈裏，終不能解决。</p>
<p>敏雖只是一個六歲的女孩子，但她却很乖巧的，她覺得母親好幾天不回家。一定有緣故的。因爲她見到在她母親沒有出走的時候，一幕流淚的悲劇，這雖然一個六歲的小孩子是不能了解的，但敏也覺得這是不樂的。</p>
<p>「母親出去了，是的，出去了。但爲怎麼好久不回來呢？」敏常常睜大了一雙小眼睛，間她的爸爸，但她爸的回答，終是「出去了。」</p>
<p>一天的晚上，她見爸爸拿着許多東西給人家帶去，怎麼箱子內的衣服都又給人家拿去的。</p>
<p>「爸！這東西拿去給誰」？敏好奇的問。</p>
<p>「給母親」！她的爸回答。爸臉上也有不快活的樣子。</p>
<p>「啊丨給母親丨爲怎麼要給母親呢？母親幾時回來呢？」敏又問她爸。</p>
<p>「我和你母親離婚了」丨父親不經意的吐出了這句話。</p>
<p>離婚二個字，敏真不懂。她又問她父親道：「怎麼？媽到底怎麼時候回來呢？」</p>
<p>「媽不回來了」丨她父親回答。</p>
<p>啊丨媽不回來了丨爲怎麼呢？敏早已知道這次媽的出去，有些特別的。但媽不回來，她仍不大明白。同時在她的小腦裏，又記起媽沒有出去的時候的一幕悲劇了，媽和父親講話，父親很光火，終至打母親了，母親流淚了，她也哭，但她哭哭，被娘姨抱去睡着，明天她就不見了媽。</p>
<p>「媽不回來了！啊！我要媽！我要媽丨」敏呌喊起來。</p>
<p>「孩子！呌怎麼！媽不回來，有怎麼要緊？」她父親呵斥她。</p>
<p>「不成！我一定要媽！一定要去找媽！」敏仍呌着。並且又哭起來了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一件不能自解的事；幷且由此事受了很大的刺激，發生了很多的感想，現在將這件事的經過寫在下面，懇你開導和指示，事情是這樣：××大學的某教員，昨午着傭人到本店來買一瓶瀉丸，到了晚上，那傭人來說：「這丸拆封後，瓶早碎了！丸已變色，請調一瓶。）丨是否原物，不能確斷；想高尙的教員，或不致掉包的。我因經理不在，無人負責，自己又是一個無權的夥計，如何可以答應哩！來說話的那位傭人，殊屬難以理喩，不得已，只好和他同到某先生的公寓去。我的原意，是想懇懇情，等經理回來再說。那知當我將來意說明之後，（我可坦白的說，我當時全無觸怒於人的言辭）。某先生幷無若何表示，而在室的另一位教員，見我人小可欺，如怒非怒很爽氣的說：「你不掉，我打你，你信不信！」說猶未畢，舉起拳頭向我面旁送來，幸我躱閃的快，不曾受着傷：爲着惡勢力的包圍，抱了「好漢不吃眼前虧的主義」，只有走爲上策。</p>
<p>現在我所不解的，是：</p>
<p>㈠一個有智識的大學教員，是否可以這樣的蠻動呢？這件事，對於教育界是否有損體面呢？</p>
<p>㈡我對於此事，應如何才能洗雪了我的恥辱？（投訴之法庭，其時孤身在場，無人爲證，且又無傷痕，勢必敗訴。）</p>
<p>㈢如訴之學校當局，是否能獲滿意的答復？</p>
<p>㈣做教員的對待學生何以謙遜，對別人何以橫蠻？其心理如何？</p>
<p>㈤設以後再有同樣的事件發生，應如何預防？</p>
<p>以上五點：乞先生不要以「大恥丨國恥丨尙且如此，小恥更宜忍受」爲簡單的答復。幸甚！幸甚！</p>
<p>××大學對面××商店兪瑞上</p>
<p>一·有智識的大學教員，是否可以這樣的蠻動？這當然是不應該的事，不過我們也應知道，所謂害羣之馬，是處處都有的，大學教員中，研究有素，學養湛深的固然很多，而憑藉着優越的機會，受到髙等教育，甚而至於留學東西洋，回國後，做了大學教員，而實際上學識並未見得髙明的，自亦所在多有，我們可不必因一二人有野蠻的舉動，就遷涉到傍人，至於此種舉動是否有損教育界的體面問題，我們以爲今日中國教育界之無團結，無紀律，實於整個中國各種問題有同　現象，大家自顧之不遑，尙何體面之可言丨像對你這樣的「蠻動」事，可算教育界損體面的事中，小之又小的事情了。</p>
<p>二·論到訴諸法律一層，編者覺得誠如來函中所說：「旣無人證，又無傷痕」，自可不必多此一舉。倘若你以這件事爲恥辱，我何以爲你以後如能因了這種激剌，努力的從事道德的修養，學術的研究和職務的勤謹，以促進你的事業得以早日成功；在成功的時候，這小小的恥辱便完全洗雪了。這種回答，恐怕你不贊成；但是有兩點，要請你注意的；（甲）大丈夫應以復國仇爲己任，小小的私嫌算得什麼？（乙）中華民族有一個最大的缺陷，就是個人間的分離性太大，而對公共事業奮鬬的意志極薄。我們希望你在遠處大處着想，負起矯正這種風氣的責任來。</p>
<p>㈢若云訴之學校當局，現在的大學當局，多半是要人，名流，他們忙的連批剳公文的時間都沒有，那裏有精神來理會這些漫不相干的閒事呢？望你不必將此事訴之學校當局，因爲訴之當局，非但得不到滿意的答復，或者，會遭受更大的侮辱。</p>
<p>㈣關於教員對學生與對別人的態度一層，大槪是以經濟爲骨幹，爽快點說：就是飯碗問題。因爲有了學生才有了飯碗，不謙遜點恐怕飯碗發生了危險。至「對別人何以蠻橫？」那也不過眼梢下面的人容易遇到這種不幸，在他髙頭的人，阿諛之不遑！還敢蠻橫嗎？這理由是很顯然的：蓋未有遇下驕傲而對上不阿諛者也。我們若更深刻一點說，所謂學識和道德雖有密切的關係，究竟是兩回事，道德髙尙的人未必就一定有淵博的學問，同樣，一個學者他的道德也未必越邁一切。（此點，對於兪君的第一個問題實有聯帶的關係）我們不要以爲大學教員是智識份子，便確定他們具有很高尙的道德。我們對於道德的看法尤不應以形式爲决定的標準。比如：我們在阡陌間遇着和顏悅色刻苦耐勞的老農夫，當然一頓時起了一種不可言喩的欽敬心：而都會裏面，衣冠華麗，揮霍自豪的市儈，反覺得是可鄙視的人。這兩種恰恰相反的心理，完全是由於社會的環境和道德的力量所產出來的；所以，道德的高下問題，不是學識的髙下所能决定的。像兪君這樣，雖然從學識上說是還不及所謂大學教員，但你尙能知道動手打人爲無禮，我們已無疑的承認你的道德在那位大學教員之上了。</p>
<p>㈤這一類的事體，頗難定一個預防的辦法。你以後處世，最好以事的性質爲標準，隨時隨地酌量情形去應付，當然沒有什麼困難。例如：你這次所遇着的事體，我們以爲你的應付很得宜。你因爲經理不在店內，自然不能當時換一瓶給他這一點，在職務上是很對的。並且你馬上和那傭人到某先生的公寓去聲明原委，也　能算爲一個　　的辦法。至於，你的面部有被另外那位教員拳擊的危險，你在當時退讓了，雖說是屈伏，但實際上，於你的人格無恙，於對方的道德大有虧損。你若在出事之後，將情形報告經理，經理就應該負責交涉；若他不去交涉，那是他的責任。你却站在不錯誤的地位，總之，我們對於這種不可理喩的橫暴之來，應在不虧責守，不喪人格的範圍內予以相當忍受，此之謂：「忍辱負重，」此之謂：「士可辱，不可屈，」我們希望兪君從這一點意思中，去領會，去理解。</p>
<p>編者按：這封信原可不必公開發表，但我們因爲有許多店員，年齡較輕，學識有限，大多數脫離家庭，缺乏親切的監護人爲之指導，往往受了很小的剌激，就引以爲奇恥大辱，釀成不幸的事端。如昨日本報第三張所載：閘北橫浜路環球製帽廠學徒安徽人吳潘章，現年十七歲，因與同事口角，遂潛服生烟而死。就是一個眼面前的例子。這種情形，深非社會之福，使我們很感覺不安；所以，特將兪君的信，分條加以解答，希望親愛的學徒們，凡遇有不可理喩的橫暴臨頭時，不要過份受感情的衝動，做出許多意外的舉動來，這是公開信的一個目的。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦歐</p>
<p>「不錯的！你原是當日出名的精靈鬼！我這件事情是給你猜到了！」她簡直和我一般的精靈。「不過，我原也不預備瞞過你：而且我很打算和你商量一番。因爲你知道：這全是他騙了我，我現在决意要和他辦交涉了！」</p>
<p>她後來這一個反跌，倒跌得大大的出乎我所能想到的事實之外了。</p>
<p>「這種男女間的糾紛，要辦交涉，就非請律師不可。······但是，你自己不也是一位不折不扣的法學士嗎？」老實說：我自己和你的糾紛，也想不出何種圓滿的解决方法，以致於實行了出亡的下策，那裏還能替她打算！因此，我一味用滑稽而不着邊際的話，作爲答復。</p>
<p>「跟你說正經話，別打混！倒是請律師這辦法，很合我自己的打算呀！周大經不是在上海當律師嗎？」我真佩服我們這位皇后娘娘的健忘。她把以前和她整天厮守在一起，像晚爺似的儘把錢供給她化的舊情人，丨周大經，竟當一個普通的舊同學一般的不介意地說出口來。</p>
<p>「對的！他在上海很有些小名氣。你們是老同學。你去找他，他準不會敲你的竹杠！」</p>
<p>她捧起玻璃杯來，喝了一口茶，很幽閒地笑着。</p>
<p>「你，······你最近可曾見過他沒有？」我準備用逐步逐步進攻的策略，勾起她和大經的舊事來，痛痛快快地把她指斥一頓。</p>
<p>「沒有。」她還是笑，鎮靜得像以前沒有和周大經說過半句話一樣。</p>
<p>「他還是很想你！想得很厲害！」我又衝進了一步。</p>
<p>「他不是早娶過親了嗎！」她開始抵抗了。</p>
<p>「但是，他並不愛他妻子；他還是愛你！」我極大膽地摜了一顆手溜彈。</p>
<p>「哈哈！······哈哈！······哈哈！·····這一顆手溜彈摜出的結果，却使她來不及的放下了茶杯，露着一種輕視的目光，看着我，像發狂似的大笑起來。</p>
<p>「哈哈！······哈哈！······」一分鐘·兩分鐘，······她繼續不斷地笑着。笑得混身全顚動了。我還沒有明瞭她何以好笑的原因，老是呆呆地怔著，旁座上有幾位正想伏案假寐的先生們，也給她這發狂似的笑聲所驚醒了，含着詫異和質問性的眼光，紛紛望着我和她的中間投來。</p>
<p>「哈哈！······哈哈！······」她簡直不顧命的笑着，我竟被她笑得手足無措了。</p>
<p>「噲！噲！李小姐！停一停再笑，可行嗎？」我不得不由進攻的地位上，退到了請降的地位上來。</p>
<p>「哈哈！······哈哈！······」好容易才結束了她的笑。她自己也笑得眼淚都滾出來了。</p>
<p>「方才這兩句話有什麼好笑，值得你這般用力的笑呢？」我忙着請問她所以笑的原因。</p>
<p>「哈哈！······哈哈！······她险些又笑了。但是，她自己就竭力忍住了笑，很爽快說出兩句驚心怵目的話來，「大經不愛他妻子，你倒愛着他的夫人了。」</p>

<p>十多年以前的西席地米爾或劉別謙，是一位德籍的史都漢姆　Eric　vonStroheim。有一天史都漢姆正是獨自在辦公室裏拍了桌子。大發雷霆。他說「爲什麼我的片子裏。要尋一個確當的女子，都尋不到，我手底下沒有一個好人，都是飯桶」</p>
<p>史都漢姆抬起頭來，看見立在他面前的，係一個瘦弱虛怯的女子。</p>
<p>「你呌什麼名子？」</p>
<p>「我呌散蘇碧慈。」</p>
<p>「笑話笑話！這呌什麼名字？好好的人，呌這種糟透了的名子？」</p>
<p>「先生是不錯的。這是我兩位姑母的名字，我的名字是紀念她們的。」</p>
<p>史都漢笑了，忙說「不要緊，不要緊，我們可以先試試。」</p>
<p>散蘇碧慈那時演的片子呌做「貪心」“Greed”碧慈扮的係一個貪心的狠婦。史都漢一發狠，拍了一百多卷（十餘萬尺）。後來他剪成了八小時的映料。這張片子，恐怕沒有公映過，牠的確是一個失敗，但牠是個經濟的失敗，而非技術上的失敗。現在一切的大片子通過係「貪心」的化身而不能脫離史都漢姆藝術的窼臼的。</p>
<p>當時看過這張「貪心」試映的，衹有六人，他們現在散處各方，還能記憶這張片子的偉大。他們提起了散蘇碧慈，都表無限的敬意。史都漢姆在試映的時候，屢次脫口而出的喊著「散蘇碧慈是一代最偉大的悲劇家！」</p>
<p>但是悲劇家的角色，　是極少的，而一代的悲劇家，亦要吃飯的。她的眼睛是非常有趣的，她手的動作，尤能使人發笑，所以她經過了多少磨練之後，就不得不改行了。光演悲劇的角色，是要餓死的。</p>
<p>真是「居移氣，養移體」，散蘇碧慈改扮了喜劇的角色，她的死僵僵的神氣，亦漸漸的褪了。她對於世界一切的見解，亦改變了，他現在是世界最發血十婦人之一，她非但能使人發笑，并且時常自己取笑自己的尋快樂。</p>
<p>最近她有一段故事。就是當拍「西線無戰事」的時候，導演雷末爾CarlLaemmle。想起了散蘇碧慈在「貪心」片子裏的形狀，就請碧慈擔任飾那可憐的德國婦人。等到片子拍完了，要試映了，大家一看見散蘇碧慈，都笑起來了。這不是可笑的片子，但是散蘇碧慈的臉一露面，觀衆等不到看她的表演就要笑出來。所以「西線無戰事」裏那一段，就是後來換了人重新拍的。</p>
<p>散蘇碧慈的悲劇時代過去了，如流水般的東去而不能復回了。史都漢姆年老眼花的看了她一齣一齣的表演喜劇，引人發笑，他還是握緊了拳頭，恨恨的咒罵著世情的顛倒，天才的淪亡。（完）</p>

<p>— 明</p>
<p>中國第一部有聲是「雨過天靑」是在日本攝制的，九一八事變，華光公司也不能再留連東隣、自己資本又不足于是宣告停業，</p>
<p>緊接着聲勢浩大的就是天乙，牠本來是家小公司，不料攝影場失火以後，邵氏弟兄下了大决心，請了七位技師，買了「西電制」的全付機械一年中成功聲片十部之多，新近據說是把「許果」等外籍職員一併拚棄，不過機器是外國貨，仍不能算純粹的國產，</p>
<p>明星公司的四達通Startone先用臘盤照了「歌女紅牡丹」成績不錯，于是也買了一套美國收音機，但是又那能算國貨呢？</p>
<p>我們看的中國有聲片僅此而已，本來，我們國裏，連無聲攝影機，膠片都沒有，又何必苛求有聲攝影機呢，不過事實非人能憶料的，有聲攝影機，却有人發明國貨了，</p>
<p>研究這有聲機的人，第一個是顏鶴鳴他用了五年苦功，居然成功了，當然並不是百分之百的發明的，多一半他是可以算仿造，但是退一步說，能仿造得成功，甚或靑出於藍那已經是工業落伍的中國可以引爲無上光榮的事了，他命名呌「顏蘇通」第一部片子，是亨生公司出品，「春潮」開拍了半年，快出版了，已拍的成績，據說有駕乎舶來的勢濤，　　第二個是竺淸賢君，他和顏氏，可以算中國影片界並立的大功臣，他造的機器呌「淸賢式有聲影片機」</p>
<p>汪福慶一聆見他成功了，便跑去定了合同，攝一部「春風楊柳」後來竺氏另外還替復旦公司製一部「爲國爭光」這幾天外景已在杭州拍完了，</p>
<p>以上三部影片，表演如何，收音如何，一槪不要問，因爲牠們是純粹中國貨有聲片不過預料都不會懷，無論怎樣，顏竺二氏的確於中國影片界有功勞。</p>

<p>「吾猜想你的生活是不很舒服吧？」菲力潑問她，起初她沒回答，後來才說：</p>
<p>「如果吾的丈夫不發癲病，每件事就都可稱心了，他在發病的時候連四個男人都不能把他撳在床上，平時他也衹昏沉沉的睡，他受勃須和柴別須雇用的時候，一塊鐵落在他的頭上，當然的醫生說這病不是爲一塊鐵而起的，說是他酒喝得太多的緣故，醫生說的或許是不錯的，不久前，吾曾跌倒在街上，醫生說吾缺少營養，唉拿了七十分尼的進欵，一樣要付房租煤氣費，還有什麼可以用呢？」她沙啞而單調的說着。</p>
<p>「好，那末去見一見柴培其先生罷，他對於你的生活或可帮助些」菲力潑鼓勵地說，於是他下意識地下了火車並沒知道現在停的是那一站，特立加而司基在他走了之後輕輕的搖了搖頭。</p>
<p>下面就是她的驚人的影片事業的開始。</p>
<p>她走進了佈置精雅的哈發事務室求見雷納德柴培其柴培其對她很有望熱，她一直立在屋子的中央，她不明白是怎麼一會事情，可是她並不驚慌，她對於每件事都感到漠然，從此她就在這裏工作，她可以得十個馬克一天，她不能相信她的幸運，</p>
<p>這裏已有許多穿得和她一樣襤褸的婦人，她們臉上也都畫着和她一樣的皺紋和黑影，她被她們擠得推前推後，但她從不曾感覺到她也是這羣衆中的一份子，在這羣塗畫的假面具中，她的真是真實得可怕，一種冷漠的神情從內心中自然的流露出來，眼睛受弧光燈强烈的剌激，淚水一直往下流，一點鐘時各演員都進膳堂裏去吃飯，她沒有一同去，她坐在工作室裏很隱蔽的一角從油布袋裏拿了一塊麵包吃着，柴培其幾乎被她撞了一交，</p>
<p>晚上八點半又開始工作，力菲潑立在她前面的一架大梯子上，他們後面有許多人用了放聲器命令着她們前進，他們吩咐過特立加而司基，如其聽到「現在去」的口號，她就得離開羣衆而向樓梯去的，她走得真十分的自然，她離開羣衆，她把手遮住强亮的燈光，她的淚流得很利害使她一些東西都看不見，攝影師在木架上興奮得發極似地轉動他的搖柄，</p>
<p>「不可思議，不可思議」有人在切切的私語着，「明天再來，吾們要拍一張單獨表演的」柴培其後來對她說，她連拍了三天，得到了三十個馬克，</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>
<h3 id="c283">影片譯名的探討 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 嘉南</p>
<p>一張片子的名子，牠籠罩着整個劇本的要旨，觀衆在未覩全片以前，看了片名，對於內容就有了相當的槪念，因此會决定了看不看的問題，所以片名和賣座力有直接的關係，現在的電影院裏，對於舶來片不管內容怎樣，老是譯成香艷肉感，和迎含一般社會心裏的名子，結果常使觀衆感着失望而咀咒，但有時也會有很不差的片子，因譯名的平淡，而造成門庭冷落的慘象，確實，對於源源不絕生產的影片，要用絕不重複而須新穎奇異的名子，實在是一件難事，不過爲營業的關係，電影院譯名的時候，於下面的幾個原則，都不可不注意，</p>
<p>（一）忠實　用新奇的名子做廣告，固屬必要，但譯名和本事，須十分符合，真假决逃不了觀衆的眼光，欺騙也衹有一次，沒命用××艷史，××奇觀來招徠，終有失敗的一天，</p>
<p>（二）雅俗共賞　含有詩意的名子，固屬很雅，但對於一般不甚了解的觀衆·有深奧的古典，未免太不普遍，</p>
<p>（三）可能時避免直譯　因爲東西風俗人情的差異，用他們常用的文字來意譯成本國文，不一定能適合·至於不大見的專門名詞，用譯音法更要不得，</p>
<p>（四）譯名須一律　這條專對開映第二輪片所下的各戲院說的，已映過的片子，用着不同的譯名，原名又不登出，常使觀衆無意再看，</p>

<p>— 星宿</p>
<p>近來從歌舞界而進電影界去的女星很多，卽如王人美，黎莉莉，都已享到了相當的名譽，電影界的注意到歌舞界裡的人才，也就是被她們兩人所引起。梅花歌舞團的龔秋霞，現在也有了入電影界的消息，不過爲了條件的不能同意，所以不能早就使她如願以償。前期本刊裡，關於她的小史，靑霞和銀光兩君所述的，其實都有錯誤，她在未加入梅花歌舞團以前，確實曾加入過葡萄歌舞團，伍佩嫻也是葡萄的團員，她們相識就在這時候。她和伍佩嫻配演的，便是「小情人」伍飾的是男性，兩人的表演，都很天真可愛，至今還是有人稱道的，可惜伍已不幸早殤了。伍確是一個女性，誤認她是男性的，或許就是她在「小情人」中飾男性的緣故。</p>

<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>現在請你再對鏡試一試第八式的表情獨習法。</p>
<p>你的吸呼能夠帮助你把眉頭和眼角皺得活像一個哭臉，淚汁自然而然的流了出來。你再仔細看一看，你臉上有沒有像笑的部分？這當然是不會有的。笑的唇角向上，而哭的唇角向下。這是顯然而見的事。是不是？但是這還不夠。稍一不愼；你的嘴唇略徽嘻開一線，攝進影機裏去，結果還是像笑。有許多有名的明星明明把真淚都哭了出來，但是結果與笑相髣髴，就因爲嘴唇沒有閉緊。</p>
<p>所以，我在這裏特別喚起你的注意。你在日後進攝影場去實習的時候，你要表演哭的鏡頭，千萬不要忽略了你的嘴唇。</p>
<p>第九式的表情獨習法就是破涕爲笑。</p>
<p>仍用默數「一·二·三·四·五·六·七·八」由鼻管中徐徐一進一口氣的方法漸漸做像一個哭臉。保持這哭臉，同時心中默數「一·二·三·四·五·六·七·八」。在徐徐呼出這一口氣的時候，你的臉部筋肉逐漸放鬆，由微笑而成哈哈大笑。同時你要對鏡細察你的眼部筋肉和嘴唇上下的筋肉起了一種甚麼樣的變化。</p>

<p>The Special Committee Adjourns Until January 16th to Reconvene</p>
<p>If a Basis for Mediation Cannot Be Compromised During the Adjournment</p>
<p>Small Countries Will Request the Use of Article 15, Paragraph 4</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations Assembly met at 10:36 this morning. Chairman Hubert of Belgium, after reviewing the process of discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute, decided to issue a formal communique and adjourned at 11:20. It will reconvene on January 16th. The communique was issued after the adjournment, stating that the Committee of Nineteen, in accordance with the task assigned by the League of Nations Assembly's resolution of December 9th, had drafted several documents outlining the basis and procedures for mediating the dispute between the two countries. These documents consisted of two draft resolutions and a statement of reasons. The chair and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations notified the Chinese and Japanese delegations. Both sides have now submitted their opinions, and further talks will require some time. In this environment, the Committee believes that it must continue its efforts to reach an agreement on such a serious issue. Therefore, to facilitate the talks, the meeting will be postponed to January 16th at the latest.</p>
<p>Finally, it stated that the Committee decided not to publish the aforementioned documents while holding talks with all relevant parties.</p>
<p>It is now heard that if China and Japan cannot accept a suitable basis for mediation before January 16th, then small countries will force the Committee of Nineteen to prepare a report and recommendations under Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. This report and recommendations do not require the consent of the parties involved.</p>
<p>Today, Chinese representative Gu Weijun expressed his deep regret that the Committee's handling of this case needed to be delayed for another month or so. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is heard that League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond and the Chairman of the Committee of Nineteen hope to continue their private talks. Although Shi Meng is not currently in Geneva, League of Nations committee member Merlot of Belgium is his representative. (Reuters Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen will adjourn until January. Meanwhile, negotiations will continue between the Japanese representatives and the Chairman of the Committee of Nineteen and the League of Nations Secretary-General. People here believe that hope has not been abandoned and that a plan can be found to eliminate Japan's opposition to certain points in the draft and the statement of reasons, and to maintain the Committee's opinion that the Lytton Report should be the basis for the mediation process. Geneva public opinion believes that neither China nor Japan has expressed a completely unyielding spirit. Therefore, it is expected that the original text, after slight modifications, can allow the proposed mediation process to begin. Japan's opposition to inviting the United States and Russia to participate in the Committee of Nineteen to assist in the mediation may also not be a problem, as neither country has expressed a strong desire to be involved in this dispute. It is heard that League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond has been very active in the negotiations in the past few days, and has devised a plan that has made Japan not oppose the draft. However, the Japanese representatives have not yet fully received instructions from Tokyo on this matter. Drummond will also consult with the diplomatic authorities of major countries on this matter in the next few days. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen is now unable to proceed because it is impossible to find a compromise that can be accepted by both China and Japan at the same time, and it is extremely difficult to maintain the prestige of the League of Nations. Judging from the current situation, both the Committee of Nineteen and the League of Nations Assembly have a tendency to stop discussing the Far East incident. The only way to preserve the face of the League of Nations is to organize a small committee to take on this hopeless situation and attempt to shirk responsibility. Expecting it to find a solution in January of next year is merely drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. (National News Agency Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>No Reconciliation Without Dissolving the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to recent confirmed information, reconciliation is almost hopeless because Japan insists on ㈠ the existence of "Manchukuo," ㈡ not invoking the Nine-Power Treaty, and ㈢ disagreeing with inviting the United States and Russia. Our side believes that to make sincere reconciliation, the puppet organization of Manchukuo must be dissolved first. If reconciliation fails, China will request the League of Nations to continue to issue a report based on Article 15 of the Covenant, stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations deemed fair and appropriate.

<p>Brings About a Bad Impression in Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to information obtained by this agency, the Committee of Nineteen seems to be dissatisfied with the strong attitude expressed by the parties concerned in recent talks, and especially with the attitude of the Japanese delegation, as the Japanese delegation has rejected almost every suggestion made to them. The news reported by this agency on Sunday has now been confirmed. According to the news, the five-member drafting committee even proposed to remove the section on non-recognition of "Manchukuo" from the resolution, in the hope of not damaging Japan's pride. However, the Committee of Nineteen firmly rejected the suggestion to recognize "Manchukuo." So far, the failure of the negotiations seems to be due to this obstacle. In this situation, a clear movement has emerged within the Committee of Nineteen, that is, no further concessions will be made beyond the concessions that have already been made to the delegations of either party. Therefore, when representatives of two countries announced their support for maintaining the basic principles of the draft resolution at the committee meeting this morning, the representatives of other countries all implicitly agreed. The committee ordered the chairman to notify the relevant countries of this expression. The majority of representatives of the Committee of Nineteen have a feeling that if the mediation work cannot be achieved within the scope of Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant, then continuing efforts may not be of any help. They seem to firmly believe that unless there is a sudden change in the situation as everyone hopes, the Committee of Nineteen will have to find a way to adopt the provisions of Article 15, Paragraph 4 when the meeting work resumes on January 16th, and issue a report declaring its judgment on the dispute.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army is actively preparing to invade Rehe, planning to use the 8th Division and the 14th Division to attack Jinxi and the Rehe border, using the puppet troops of Cheng Guorui, Zhang Ziqing, etc., as guides. At the same time, they are transferring aircraft units in the Northeast to Jin County and Yixian. The airfield is now fully prepared, and will first attack Suizhong, Xingcheng, and Yixian. The second step is to invade Rehe from two routes, from the Jin-Chao Road and Tongliao. The 14th Regiment, which was previously withdrawn from Heilongjiang Province, was transferred to Tongliao via the Tao-Ang Road, where they disembarked. There are more than 2,000 Japanese troops. A unit of the 5th Regiment of the 8th Division stationed in Jinzhou, led by Guyi, consisting of 1,200 men, departed on three trains for Yixian to concentrate. Meanwhile, they are using Mongolian bandits and Chinese traitors to disrupt the Rehe border. A Japanese armored train opened fire at Nanling a few days ago. On the 18th, 13 aircraft from Yixian circled Chaoyang County for 30 minutes, firing machine guns downwards for more than ten minutes, causing more than ten casualties among our civilians. The Rehe army's Dong Futing Brigade is guarding the Koubei Yingzi area. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese armored train departed from Chaoyang Temple to Nanling on the morning of the 19th, and then advanced to Sanbaoyingzi, intending to provoke. At the same time, Koubei Yingzi is under pressure. Our army is calmly holding the defense line. The Japanese army failed to achieve its goal, fired a few shots, and retreated to Nanling Station. The righteous army encountered the Japanese army at Qingmen and Qiumuzhuang, and fought fiercely yesterday. The Japanese army bombarded various places with aircraft, which was extremely intense. The Japanese army has sent a division from Shenyang, disembarking at Goubangzi, Jin County, and Suizhong, reportedly preparing to attack Rehe. (Telegram, 20th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After Han Fuju arrives in Beiping on the 23rd, he will stay for about three days before going to Nanjing to pay his respects to Chiang Kai-shek.

The Japanese will supply the pay and weapons. At the same time, they are planning to buy off our government troops.

<h3 id="e20">Heat River Situation Urgent <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>(1) The League of Nations' Inability</p>
<p>Since the League of Nations convened, time has dragged on until today. "Justice" and "international treaties" have become mere scraps of paper under the iron fist of the Japanese army. The Shenyang Incident, the bombardment of Jinzhou, the bloodstains beside the Nenjiang Bridge, the trampling of northern Manchuria, and the destruction of twenty billion yuan of wealth in the Songhu battle have all occurred. Even the Lytton Commission acknowledged that on September 18th, "[the incident] did not in fact prevent the punctual arrival of the southbound train from Changchun. Even in terms of the damage to the railway itself, it is not sufficient to justify military action..." As for the formation of the Manchurian puppet regime, the Lytton Commission also "believed that although there were some contributing factors to the formation of the Manchurian state, the two most powerful factors were the presence of the Japanese army and the activities of Japanese civilian and military officials..." The Japanese have denied such ironclad evidence of reality and instead glorified it as peace in East Asia. Unfortunately, some members of the League of Nations have also secretly supported them while outwardly suppressing them. Thus, the so-called "justice" in the international arena has been entirely dominated by the powerful. Our people have endured and waited repeatedly, but as a result of this endurance and waiting, the League of Nations not only lacks the power to restrain Japan's violence, but also overturned its own resolution of September 30th last year, even lacking the courage to speak out, accommodating Japan's so-called "facts" in an attempt to temporarily muddle through.</p>
<p>(2) Japan Increases Troops in the Northeast Again</p>
<p>Can such a muddle-through situation last long? Will the Japanese militarists be satisfied after annexing the three northeastern provinces? After the Shenyang Incident and before the fall of Jinzhou, it was known that this matter could not be resolved by muddling through. It is even more difficult for the three northeastern provinces to satisfy the狂慾of the imperialists.</p>
<p>It is still remembered that before the League of Nations sent an investigation team last December 10th, the Japanese army occupying the Northeast consisted only of the South Manchurian Railway Guard and the Sendai Second Division, the Longshan Twentieth Division. The total number was no more than 50,000. By the time the investigation team came east and the Songhu battle broke out, the Hirosaki Eighth Division, Himeji Tenth Division, Utsunomiya Fourteenth Division, as well as cavalry and artillery units from the Kashima, Nagoya, Kurume, and Tokyo divisions, were added to the three northeastern provinces. The total number of combat troops exceeded 100,000 to fight against our starving and freezing volunteer army, which was fighting for the last survival of the nation. Ma, Su, Zhang, Wu, and other volunteer armies relied on their sincere hearts and flesh and blood to resist airplanes and steel cannons. They faced a strong enemy in front and had no reinforcements behind. However, this army of righteous indignation, on the one hand, inspired future generations, letting them know that our people would not succumb to violence, and that those who came after should strive to avenge the humiliation. On the other hand, they restrained Japan, preventing it from advancing westward. Sacrificing a piece of land to preserve the integrity of the interior. Little did they know that a weary army could not last long. News of the defeats of Ma and Su was frequently received, and the alarming news of Japan increasing its troops arrived again.</p>
<p>The justification was that it was to replace the Sendai Second Division's relief troops. In reality, only a portion of the Second Division that was wounded or should be discharged returned to Japan, while the rest remained in the Northeast. The added troops were the entire Kumamoto Sixth Division, and their destination was the Jin-Yi and Chaoyang areas.</p>
<p>(3) Tension on the Border of Heat River, Crisis at Shanhaiguan</p>
<p>Since Japan increased its troops in the Northeast, Chaoyang and Beipiao have repeatedly reported emergencies. The Shanhaiguan area has also been repeatedly provoked. Although a peaceful solution was reached, the Japanese continued to fabricate false evidence to disrupt Luandong and take the opportunity to窥探Heat River.</p>
<p>On the surface, this kind of speculation seems to be a case of神经過敏. Moreover, Japan, at this time of internal and external pressure, with a tight budget and under the constraints of the League of Nations, how could it disregard everything and blindly invade? However, the Japanese cabinet believes that Heat River was already within the scope defined in the Twenty-One Demands, so they frequently refer to it as Manchuria and Mongolia, implying that it includes the three northeastern provinces and Inner Mongolia. However, Inner Mongolia is vast and sparsely populated, and it would require ten times the current troop strength to cover it. Even if our authorities continue to implement a policy of non-resistance, Japan cannot help but be wary of the rise of grassroots national heroes. From an economic perspective, Heat River is rich in minerals and produces excellent wool, almost the best in our country. These are all things that Japan lacks and has been scheming to seize day and night. Moreover, China and Russia have now restored diplomatic relations. Although what has been restored is only ordinary diplomatic relations, we do not hope for any unexpected assistance. However, the Japanese believe that if China and Russia join hands, Japan's special rights in the Northeast will be fundamentally shaken. Therefore, they spread rumors everywhere that China is full of red influence and that without Japan's maintenance, peace in East Asia cannot be guaranteed. Thus, England listens to them, and America is confused by them. Now they will have more pretexts to fabricate rumors. Taking advantage of America's indecisiveness and the Soviet Union's eagerness for self-construction, they will unleash their ambitions and take further steps in their invasion.</p>
<p>(4) Arise Quickly to Seek Survival</p>
<p>Since the Northeast has completely fallen and Heat River and Luandong are simultaneously reporting emergencies, it is now impossible to endure any further, and impossible to concede any further. It is a matter of life or death, survival or destruction, in this final act. From now on, we must implement a national mobilization, immediately implement conscription, and implement forced labor, transforming the people, who are like a sheet of loose sand, into a strong organizational body with cohesion. The nascent industry must also implement industrial mobilization to seek a rapid development of military industry and general industry with collective strength. Strive with the strength of the people of the whole country to fight for the last survival of the nation, so that we may save ourselves.</p>

<p>(Hankou) The two Liu armies and Deng's troops and Chen's divisions have continued to fight fiercely in the Ren-Yi-Jia area for days. The provincial army has a total of eighteen brigades, and the Chongqing army has a total of sixteen brigades, accompanied by the air force. The battle of Renshou is especially intense. Liu Xiang has returned to Zigong to command again, and Liu Wenhui is also commanding in Meishan. The Chongqing army attacking Renshou has retreated dozens of miles. The Jing-Jia line remains unchanged. Tian's attack on Liu Wenhui's troops has not yet made contact. Deng and Tian are still stationed in Chengdu. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tian Songyao's office in Beijing received a telegram from Sichuan stating that after a fierce battle between the two armies in the Matajing area between Jingyan and Jiading, Liu Wenhui's troops suffered more than 10,000 casualties, Liu's brigade commander was killed in battle, and the remaining brigade and Wang's regiment were completely wiped out. Liu Xiang's troops also suffered more than 3,000 casualties. Xiang ordered a general offensive again on the 16th, and the main forces are advancing. Even if Liu Wenhui can retreat into Shangnan, he still has no way to defend due to a lack of weapons and ammunition. Therefore, Li, Luo, and Liu's divisions are all advancing, more than ten miles away from Renshou. Yang Sen has arrived at Beidou Town, and Xiang's Wang division is in Renshou, fighting fiercely with Hui's troops. Hui's troops are unable to resist and are retreating towards Meiqing. Our army has joined forces and is advancing towards the Jingyan-Renshou line. Luo's division and Li and Liu's brigades are advancing towards the Xinjin-Shuangliu line.

<h3 id="e62">Hoover Reports to Congress on Adjusting War Debt Plan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Believes War Debt is Closely Related to Disarmament</p>
<p>Does Not Approve of Cancellation, Concessions Must Be Conditional</p>
<p>Advocates Forming a Committee for International Negotiations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 19th – U.S. President Hoover today delivered a special report to Congress on the war debt issue. His tone was extremely resolute, stating that he would swiftly proceed with negotiations to restructure the war debt, regardless of whether Congress approves. He also indirectly declared to the debtor nations in an even more firm tone that the United States should respect the requests for renegotiation from countries that maintain their debt obligations. However, for countries in arrears, negotiations will not begin until after the overdue payments due on December 15th have been made. The President’s report was read to both houses of Congress after the stock market closed to prevent any impact on the market. Its content is essentially a concise plan for a rapid adjustment of war debts, clearly indicating that the current payment schedule should be revised. However, it also clearly states that war debts cannot be canceled, and any concessions must be compensated for in other ways. The wording throughout implies that discussions will only be held with certain countries, not with those in arrears. In addition, he will propose to Congress the appointment of a bipartisan U.S. delegation to attend the World Disarmament Conference and authorize them to negotiate on the war debt issue. The selection of the delegates will require the consent of President-elect Roosevelt before a final decision is made. He stated that the situation is so urgent that we must cooperate nationally for the welfare of the American people and to overcome the forces that threaten the foundation of our culture. According to reports, Hoover’s words refer to the arrears in war debt payments and the failure of various countries to disarm. The report consistently treats war debts and disarmament as a single issue. He continued by stating that it is necessary to establish a suitable mechanism. Ordinary diplomatic channels and facilities are no longer adequate. Only by sending extremely qualified representatives to sit around a table can we expect the best negotiations. These representatives should be selected immediately to prepare for the World Economic Conference and exchange views on war debts with certain countries, as well as advise the government on the course of action to be taken with respect to other countries. (The report likely refers to countries in arrears when mentioning "other countries.") The President also stated that there would be significant benefits to coordinating these issues with the Disarmament Conference and emphasized that the issue of disarmament is the most important aspect of this problem, even more important than the arrears in payments due in December. He also cited statistics comparing European military spending with the amount paid on war debts, stating that, except for one country, the amount needed to repay debts is less than a quarter of their military expenditures. This also reveals where Hoover places the emphasis on the war debt issue. The report also stated that this plan is designed to prevent war debt negotiations from being affected by changes in government and to avoid delays in progress. The report indicates that this plan requires Congressional approval, but the President also stated that he believes the matter is extremely urgent and cannot be delayed any longer, and that he will initiate action himself, regardless of Congress’s actions.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Roosevelt's Opinion <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations Should Proceed Through Ordinary Diplomatic Channels</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 19th – The U.S. government is currently awaiting the reaction in Congress to the President’s war debt report. According to reports, President-elect Roosevelt prefers to conduct negotiations with debtor nations through ordinary diplomatic channels. He still believes that diplomats are well-suited to handle all the necessary negotiations, especially in the initial stages. He believes that the initial task is to investigate what European countries are currently capable of doing and to explore what methods they are willing to propose and accept. Therefore, he does not support the formation of a special committee to handle these negotiations.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th – Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement supporting President Hoover’s message to Congress. Borah also advocated for convening a world conference as soon as possible to address disarmament, currency, and war debt issues.</p>
<h3 id="e65">British Newspapers Unanimously Welcome <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th – London newspapers have widely published editorials welcoming President Hoover’s message to Congress on the war debt issue. Conservative, Labour, and Liberal parties share the same excitement. The Daily Telegraph (Conservative) stated that President Hoover’s message is welcomed in Britain because Britain has paid what it owes and hopes to reconsider the war debt issue on the best terms possible. The Daily Herald (Labour) stated that Britain can at least begin discussions with a genuine hope of achieving results, as the foundation has been laid. The Westminster Gazette (Liberal) stated that President Hoover’s declaration, regardless of any criticism it may receive in the United States, is truly courageous and deserves our gratitude and even our admiration.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Opportunities for U.S.-Soviet Rapprochement Further Advanced <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Economic Reasons Transform into Political Reasons</p>
<p>Objective is to Counter Japanese Advances in Mainland Policy</p>
<p>Slogan: "The Enemy of My Enemy is My Friend"</p>
<p>New York – News of Sino-Soviet rapprochement has greatly excited American political circles and those concerned about the situation in the Far East. Opportunities for the United States to recognize the Soviet Union have therefore advanced further. It is anticipated that pro-recognition sentiment will peak with the inauguration of President Roosevelt. There has been a major shift in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's attitude towards this issue, with nine members now in favor of recognition, five opposed, and seven undecided. President Roosevelt has publicly pledged to study this issue with an open mind, meaning he will favor recognition if it is in the best interests of the United States. Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has submitted a resolution on the recognition of the Soviet Union to the committee, but stated that he will not press for a vote on the resolution until Roosevelt's attitude is more firmly expressed. However, President Hoover remains opposed to recognition and is likely to veto or block any pro-recognition proposals. In addition, patriotic groups and large commodity industries such as coal and lumber, fearing competition from Russian goods, are also vigorously opposing recognition. According to impartial observers, the first step on this issue will likely be to establish a committee to investigate trade relations with Russia and study U.S. demands towards Russia, such as the confiscation of property and denial of loans. Supporters of recognition have primarily based their arguments on the development of commerce, but now a political dimension related to the Far Eastern situation has been added, transforming the arguments. There is now a movement to quickly recognize and assist the Soviet Union to counter Japanese advances in mainland policy. These people believe that America's potential enemies are Japan across the Pacific and Europe across the Atlantic, so they advocate for the recognition of the Soviet Union with the slogan "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." These people believe that there are minimal conflicts of interest between the Soviet Union and the United States geographically, militarily, or commercially. Once the war debt issue among European and American countries is resolved, the United States will shift its attention to the Far East. However, the restoration of U.S.-Soviet relations will depend on various investigations after the new president takes office, and it is too early to say anything concrete at this time.

<p>Wilson's Right-Hand Man</p>
<p>Explains the Stimson Doctrine</p>
<p>New York – Colonel House, former President Wilson’s “right-hand man,” published an essay on several foreign policy issues facing the incoming Roosevelt administration in the latest issue of "Foreign Affairs Quarterly." His perspective as a Democrat on the foreign policy of a Democratic government has attracted the attention of readers. The essay states, "One of the most pressing issues in recent months has been the situation in the Far East. The United States has a dual interest in the Manchurian dispute. The first is to uphold the effectiveness of treaties, because upholding the effectiveness of treaties is part of the overall issue of maintaining international peace. The second is to uphold the traditional U.S. Open Door policy. Regarding this second point, our government's policy should be based on changes in the world and the Far Eastern situation, and should be open to negotiation. Secretary of State Stimson's doctrine, announced last year, focuses on two paths: either a return to the previous status quo through the voluntary actions of the two directly involved parties in the Manchurian dispute, or a resolution of outstanding issues through direct negotiations without further bloodshed."

<h3 id="e68">British-Persian Oil Dispute <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Behind the Scenes, There is Activity by American Capitalists</p>
<p>Attempting to Oust Britain's Monopoly on Persian Trade</p>
<p>Italy Also Unwilling to Relinquish Rights</p>
<p>(League of Nations Decides to Postpone Discussion)</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 19th – The League of Nations Council has now received a letter from the Persian delegation, in which they stated the threatening attitude of the British government towards Persia. The letter declared that the Persian government is willing to submit the matter to the Council, but requested a slight delay in the meeting so that the Persian representatives could return to Tehran to bring necessary documents to Geneva. It was also stated that the Persian government does not want to adopt any plans detrimental to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company before the Council makes a decision, so the matter is not urgent. The Council has now decided to postpone the discussion of this dispute until the next regular session in January. The Acting Chairman of the League of Nations Council, Mr. Loster, has now telegraphed to both the British and Persian governments, asking them not to take any actions that could aggravate the situation or expand the dispute while the Council is studying the matter, and declared that the Council has postponed the issue until the next regular session for further discussion.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 19th – British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell today denied in the House of Commons the claim that the British government had sent warships to Persian territorial waters to protect British interests due to the dispute with Persia.</p>
<p>London – This British-Persian oil dispute is a major international capital war with complex underlying issues. On the Persian side, it is because the company did not comply with the contract to pay 16% of its profits to the Persian government, hence the strong stance. On the British side, it is believed that the original contract did not contain a clause on the abolition of concessions, and that the Persian government's decision to abolish the concessions is completely illegal. The damages suffered by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are the responsibility of the Persian government. In addition, the cause of this dispute is actually the behind-the-scenes activities of American capitalists. American capital groups such as Morgan &amp; Company, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company, and General Motors Corporation have successively sent representatives to Persia to negotiate with the Persian government, seeking to overthrow Britain's monopoly on Persian trade. If American capitalists can obtain this exclusive right, they will organize a U.S.-Persian company with a capital of $2 million, and in addition to taking over all of Persia's imports and exports, they will also establish various factories and develop Persia's domestic industries. In addition, the Italian government has also issued a strong ultimatum to the Persian government, notifying them to suspend all negotiations until the Italian delegation arrives in Persia. The fact that the Persian government secretly sent a military mission to the United States three weeks ago to purchase several million dollars worth of military supplies has also recently been revealed. Therefore, this British-Persian dispute is the beginning of a major international capital war, and should not be taken lightly. (World News Agency)</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 19th – Tonight, Prime Minister MacDonald was giving a radio broadcast appealing to the nation to find a livelihood for the unemployed. The House of Commons was debating a supplementary budget of £19 million to fund unemployment relief when a large group of unemployed people marched to the House of Commons, urging prompt relief for the unemployed and their families. Led by former Communist MP Saklatvala, representatives entered the House of Commons, attempting to meet with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour. They were told to submit a written request, so Saklatvala and the representatives quietly withdrew, but the demonstrators still surrounded the House of Commons. They were later dispersed by the police without incident. When voting on the budget, Labour MPs proposed a formal amendment opposing the government's unemployment policies, which was defeated by a vote of 216 to 31.</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 19th – The new cabinet held its first meeting today. Prime Minister Pongou gave an opening speech, saying, "From the organization of this cabinet, it can be seen that we have sincerity in our approach to governance and in continuing the previous work. Our reason for doing so is not only to honor Herriot's achievements, but also because our country's politics must continue the previous course. We are pursuing a policy of peace and building peace, a policy of democracy and building democracy, and a policy of revitalizing finance. Our appointment of Cheron as Minister of Finance demonstrates the government's desire to be sincere with the people. If the people can truly understand the real situation of the finances, they will certainly support the various necessary measures we take."</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 19th – The new French cabinet formed by Pongou was welcomed by the stock exchange here. Government bonds all rose in price today. Pongou convened his first cabinet meeting today to discuss administrative policies, which will be read in parliament on Thursday. The new government will announce the continuation of Herriot's policies, except for war debts. Herriot advocated paying the installment due this month on the condition that the United States was willing to reconsider the entire war debt issue. However, the new government insists that it will not pay the debt without a new solution. The new government must now propose a method of approving expenditures on a monthly basis to raise funds to get through the end of the year. Some believe that the Pongou government can only last until the New Year.</p>

<h3 id="e74">A Glimpse of Japanese Right-Wing Groups <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Japan has been affected by the global economic panic, although not severely. However, domestic changes are very drastic. The Communist Party, after severe crackdowns, seems to have subsided on the surface. Many leading figures are in prison, and the general labor movement has entered a clandestine state due to market decline. Right-wing groups originally intended to oppose left-leaning ideologies and resist communism. Now that the left wing is engaging in secret activities and the social situation and the lives of the general public are deteriorating, even those who labor all day cannot achieve warmth and sustenance. Therefore, patriotic groups originally aimed at dealing with advanced ideas, except for refraining from infringing upon the Emperor and expressing respect for the powerful military, express active dissatisfaction with the current political parliamentary system and harbor particularly deep resentment towards financial capitalists. This is indeed an inevitable natural trend in Japanese society. However, it greatly deviates from the original intention of Japanese militarists to utilize right-wing ideology and the deep-seated intentions of political figures to cultivate patriotic thought. The most obvious and powerful proof of this is the assassination of Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi of the Minseitō cabinet. Amidst the fierce fighting in Shanghai, Inoue Junnosuke, a financial expert from the Minseitō, and Takuma Dan, a loyal servant of the Mitsui conglomerate, were assassinated one after another. On May 15th, at 5:30 PM, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was shot and killed by active-duty military officers at his official residence. From then on, right-wing groups became even more rampant. If Prime Minister Saitō Makoto did not have the support of the navy, he would probably have followed in Inukai's footsteps. Since his inauguration (cabinet formed on May 28th), which was just over six months ago, there have been as many as four discovered assassination plots. Behind these violent acts, right-wing groups provide the underlying strength, while the instigators are said to have a separate "General Staff Headquarters."</p>
<p>In the navy, Marshal Tōgō Heihachirō leads everything. Next, Yamamoto Gonnohyōe, Saitō Makoto, Okada Keisuke, and others support and maintain its consistent system. However, in the army, after Yamagata Aritomo, there was only Tanaka Giichi. After Tanaka's death, Utsunomiya Katsusaburō should have been the successor based on seniority and prestige. However, although Utsunomiya had deep qualifications, his knowledge was relatively poor, and his skills were weak, so he could not lead the entire army. The army is divided into three factions. The former Minister of the Army, General Minami Jiro, General Kanaya Hanzō, and General Suzuki Sōroku, along with Lieutenant Generals such as Abe Nobuyuki (current commander of the Taiwan Army), Terauchi Hisaichi (commander of the 4th Division stationed in Osaka), Sugiyama Gen (commander of the 12th Division stationed in Kurume, Kyushu, one of the five special large divisions of the Japanese army), and Hayashi Senjūrō (leader of the retired lieutenant generals), are the mainstays of the Utsunomiya faction. Qin Zhenji (Lieutenant General, commander of the Kempeitai), Koiso Kuniaki (Lieutenant General, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army stationed in Manchuria), and Kageyama Yoshitsugu (Lieutenant General), are the leading generals of the current Vice Chief of Staff, Mazaki Jinzaburō's faction. Although the Araki (Sadao) faction seems to encompass Mazaki on the surface, those who support Araki include General Mutō Nobuyoshi (current commander of the Kwantung Army). Mid-level officers include Major General Nagata Tetsuzan, Major General Itagaki Seishirō, Colonel Ishiwara Kanji, and Lieutenant Colonel Hashimoto Kingoro. These young officers all want to actively expand their military operations against China to exaggerate their achievements. Therefore, they mobilize veterans and incite the organization of right-wing groups to raise public morale, not knowing that the result is only to disrupt Japanese society and lead it into an incurable state. Japanese right-wing groups can be roughly divided into three major factions. The first category is purely nationalists. The second category is nationalists with some elements of modern thought. The third category is the right-wing of socialism, who approve of militarism and aggression, but attach conditions for the liberation of toiling workers and peasants. These three are described below.</p>
<p>The first category originated from the Gen'yōsha founded by Toyama Mitsuru. Its formation coincided with the Meiji Restoration. Initially, it was an organization for cultivating learning and training the body and mind. Later, it transformed into a Rōnin association specializing in invading China. In addition to Toyama Mitsuru, the giant of the nationalist faction, his colleague Uchida Ryōhei was a strong general of the society. Uchida was the center in establishing the Kokuryūkai. Although it also plagiarized some social policy proposals, established simple cafeterias, and ran workers' dormitories, it strongly advocated the mixture of Eastern and Western cultures, promoted Eastern culture, and severely criticized the bias of the rule of law. Therefore, it advocated developing the mysteries of Emperor worship, reforming the current system, resolving labor-management issues, revitalizing the martial spirit, and strengthening national defense agencies. Thus, Shiba Shirō had the Daitamin Club, Mori Kenji had the Taisho Sekishin Group, and Ishii Saburō, Ogawa Heikichi, and Lieutenant General Tachibana Koichirō also founded the Kōdōgikai, etc. Although the names are different, the content is the same. The Jūō Club was once rampant in the Waseda University district, and its struggles against left-wing scholars such as Nosaka Sanzō, Ōyama Ikuo, and Chō Kotsunan were particularly fierce. The first task of the Japan Great Nationalist Society, the Kantō Nationalist Society, the Yamato People's Labor Association, the New Japan Association, and the Anti-Reddening Group, etc., is to prevent the spread of left-leaning ideologies, to uphold the imperial family as the center, to overthrow Marxism, and to establish national authority. The Manchuria-Mongolia Group, the Shūsūikai, the Daitōsha, and the Great Japan Justice Group, although claiming to be anti-communist, place more emphasis on the invasion of the Northeast. The Tenkōkai and the Independent Youth Society, directly subordinate to the Rōnin Association and the Kokuryūkai, have transformed from external struggles to internal conspiracies, secretly importing military supplies and planning assassinations. As for the Great Japan Production Party, it is just a smokescreen, while the Kaiseikai and the Meirin Society, two military social groups, are actually the instigators behind the aforementioned groups. However, these soldiers mostly belong to the old school and have very high positions, and are far removed from the general public.</p>
<p>The second category is radical nationalist groups. The first organization established was the "Rōzōkai," formed by Ōi Kentarō, Ōkawa Shūmei, Mitsukawa Kametarō, Nakano Seigō, Takabatake Motoyuki, Shimanaka Yūzō, etc. Among them were nationalists, socialists, liberals, soldiers, and old parties. After Iwata of the Daikakai, Shimizu of the Daikōsha, and Tatsukawa and Ōkawa of the Shiranami-kai discussed, they established the Yūzonsha, using the national spirit as a creative revolution to build a revolutionary empire. Ōkawa Shūmei's Kōchisha, meaning "following heaven and earth," followed the guidelines of the Yūzonsha, which were to strongly oppose Japan's current complacency and to deeply resent contemporary zaibatsu. Therefore, it advocated actively invading Manchuria, but the spoils of invasion should be given to the Emperor, who would then bestow them upon his subjects. After the September 18th Incident, the society was unusually active in the Northeast. Due to conflicts with the military's policy of linking financial capitalists, it rejected the development of Japanese financial capital in the Northeast. As a result, Ōkawa was arrested in Dalian, and the activities of the Kōchisha were also hit. The Daikakai of Iwata Fumio, the Daikōkai of Shimizu Kōnosuke, the Shiranami-kai of Tatsukawa Shizuo, and the Tōkai Alliance of Ōsugi Seishi all arose after the dissolution of the Yūzonsha. Although their outlines and details are different, their essence is largely similar. The spirit of the Tōkō League, the Isshinkai, the All Japan Yōkokudōshikai, the Daihōsha, the Shirinsō, the Kokumin Sensensha, and the Jinbukai are inconsistent and their substance differs, but their general consciousness is the same as that of the Kōchisha. Ōkawa even served as the chairman of the Jinbukai. This faction has direct connections with the Kozakukai, the Sakurakai, and the Yōyōkai, which are social groups for middle and lower-ranking military officers. Therefore, military giants also interact with them, and Heisaka Kiichi of the Kokuhonsha and Lieutenant General Kikuchi Takeo also belong to this category.</p>
<p>The third category, the National Socialist Party, is the radical faction among Japanese right-wing parties. Its leading figures also came from the Social Democratic Party, such as Akamatsu Katsumarō, who was an actual labor activist of the faction, and Kondō Eizō and Hayashi Aokio, who were theorists of the faction. Hirano Rikizō led peasant organizations. Its theoretical magazine is "National Socialism." Nagano Akira is an actual guide in the rural movement, and Son Kwon-seong engages in theoretical struggles. Although its formation time is short and its mass power is weak, it is more active among right-wing groups.</p>
<p>The above is a brief description of the situation of Japanese right-wing groups, which is inevitably simplified, but it is largely complete. From this, one can also see the complexity within its right-wing groups. If the military does not meddle in it, its internal struggles will outweigh its external aggression.

<h3 id="e75">Inspection Record of Suppressing Communists and Recovering Various Areas (III) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Situation in the Jingzhou-Shashi Area</p>
<p>After the reporter accompanied the inspection group to inspect Yuekou Port on the Xiang River, at 9:00 AM on the tenth, they took a car westward from Yuekou to inspect the Jingzhou-Shashi area. At 11:00 AM, they arrived at Zhangjia Port, which is 45 li from Yuekou and located on the north bank of the Xiang River. It is an important route from Yuekou to Jiangling and is crucial in suppressing the communists. After the communists occupied Honghu, they advanced and occupied this area as a stronghold on the north bank of the Xiang River, invading Tianmen to the east, attacking Jingmen to the north, and attacking Jiangling to the west. From 1927, bandits frequently appeared here, demolishing civilian houses and building pontoon bridges on the Xiang River to connect with the bandit areas on the south bank of the Xiang River. The National Army repeatedly attacked and suppressed them, gaining and losing it at times. The communists occupied this place for a total of two years, causing extremely heavy losses. The residents' property was looted, and the houses were almost completely burned down. It was not until June or July of this year that it was completely recovered. Now, the people's livelihood is declining to the extreme. The residents have no way to make a living, and they dismantle and sell the bricks, tiles, and wood of all the remaining broken houses to exchange for grains to prolong their lives. Some even eat grass roots and tree bark every day. The miserable situation is unbearable to witness. Traveling west from Zhangjia Port, they arrived at Shayang at around 12:00 PM. This place is located in the middle reaches of the Xiang River, connecting Jiangling and Shashi to the west, Qianjiang and Honghu to the south, Tianmen to the east, and Zhongxiang to the north. It has always been a commercial center. In July of last year, the New Third Brigade suffered a defeat here and was occupied by the communists, who looted everything. It was not until October of last year that it was recovered by Zhang Zhenhan's 41st Division. Now, commerce is declining, finance is in a panic, and the general merchants and people are in extreme distress. The rural fields are barren, and the scene is even more desolate. The local militia in the city is well-organized, armed with broadswords. There are only a few primary schools for education, and there are not many students. According to Division Commander Zhang Zhenhan, the communists in Hubei were not paid attention to at first, which led to their spread. The stationed troops were busy fighting and were frequently transferred, so they could not concentrate on suppressing the bandits. After 1930, the Tenth Army returned from Henan Pass, but it only suppressed them locally. At that time, the troops stationed in Zoujing were weak, and they were fighting in the east and fleeing in the west, without a whole plan. After Commander Jiang (Jieshi) took office in Wuhan, he transferred a large army to block and suppress them in separate routes. After fighting for several months, he has achieved today's results. The reasons for the spread of the communists are partly due to the decline of the people's livelihood and partly due to the failure of the army to concentrate on suppressing them. The communists originally had only a few hundred guns, but they gradually increased after robbing the guns of the police and security teams in the various counties and towns. Now, although there are militia organizations for suppressing communists in various cities, towns, and villages, they are not enough to prevent bandits unless they are militarized and disciplined. The communists are organized tightly, and all soviets and troops are commanded by the Communist Party. The Party has supreme authority. In their battles, they concentrate all their strength on the front line and threaten the people to organize red guards and guerrillas to create momentum. They train the peasants very strictly, requiring them to hold meetings once a day and hold a large parade once a week, so that the general peasants have a group organization. As for the communists' methods of deceiving the people, they are also extremely clever, advocating resisting rent and taxes, overthrowing rich peasants, killing intellectuals, and improving the lives of workers and peasants. The general ignorant people were deceived at first, but now they have realized their deceit and seen through their treachery. At 6:00 PM on the tenth, they crossed the Yangtze River and arrived at Shashi via Jiangling. Today, they actually inspected Jiangling and Shashi. Jiangling is an ancient important town with many relics of Guan Yu, but they have mostly been submerged. In recent years, the city has been plagued by soldiers and bandits, and is dilapidated and desolate, unlike its former prosperity. The jurisdiction area is 700 li in circumference, and one-third of the county has been ravaged by the communists. The southern villages have suffered quite severely. According to a certain gentleman in the local area, Jiangling is harmed by soldiers and bandits more than by the Red Party. In the past, the village chiefs colluded with bandits, running rampant in the villages, and the official government could do nothing. The people had nowhere to appeal. In addition, Cui Erdan's troops were stationed in the Jingmen area, and the local bullies relied on them as a shield to collude with each other, making the people's lives unbearable. All of these things created opportunities for the communists. Now, the village teams are still the same as before, and the authorities are currently trying to rectify them, intending to confiscate the guns of all the teams and reorganize them to eliminate harm to the people. The political aspects have always been quite dark, and the authorities have recently been rectifying them. As for education, on the surface, many schools have been established, but in reality, few students enroll. In the past, educational funding was lacking, and the school authorities issued salary arrears vouchers indiscriminately. Those who held the vouchers colluded with the stationed troops to extort money from the county government. The county government, threatened by their power, had to pay according to the list, which led to many abuses. This spring, a certain army built an airport, demanding huge sums of money and setting a deadline for completion. The requisitions were sent out in all directions, urgent as a fire. The people's hardship was half caused by the poor discipline of the stationed troops. Now, Jingzhou and Shashi have been taken over by Xu Yuanquan's Tenth Army, and the military authorities are planning to find ways to relieve the people's difficulties and move towards a path of improvement. Although the communists in the Jingzhou-Shashi area have been cleared on the surface, there are still many who are lurking in the dark and plotting to take advantage of opportunities. In order to clear the bandits, the authorities are conducting a household registration survey and implementing the Baojia system. Shashi was originally a large port in the upper Yangtze River, and commerce was extremely prosperous in the past. In recent years, due to the influence of military affairs and the ravages of the communists, the rural villages in the four directions have gone bankrupt, and commerce has been severely hit. The general merchants are unable to maintain their businesses. In short, the area from Jingzhou and Shashi to the east of Hougang has been directly destroyed by the communists. Although the area west of Hougang has not been directly ravaged by the communists, the indirect impact is extremely great. It will not be possible to recover in a day or two.

<h3 id="e76">Recent Situation in the Sichuan War <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing Air News: The main bodies of the Sichuan War are Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui. Others, such as Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, Li Jiayu, and Luo Zezhou, are just guests, only taking advantage of the mutual infighting between the two Lius to gain benefits. There was originally no inevitable momentum for war, but Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui were fighting to the death due to issues of survival. After the wave of cooperation from five divisions in Chengdu, the Sichuan War went from being dormant to active again. Liu Xiang amassed his troops and attacked Liu Wenhui fiercely, hoping to wipe out the 24th Army in one fell swoop. Seeing the situation was not good, Liu Wenhui automatically abandoned Chengdu and used all his strength to deal with the 21st Army. Therefore, there have been unprecedented fierce battles in the areas of Jiading, Renshou, and Jingyan recently, with an intensity never seen before. After Liu Wenhui withdrew from Chengdu, he convened a meeting of all the army generals in Meishan, unanimously deciding to bet on their final fate with the 21st Army. Xia Zhongshi was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the first route, commanding eight brigades including Yu Zhongying, Zhang Zhifang, Li Yushu, Gao Yucong, Peng Chengfu, Chen Xinmin, Liu Wencai, and Chen Mingqian, concentrated in Jiading. Leng Yindong was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the second route, leading five brigades including Zhao Peishan, Wang Yuanliang, Cheng Zimin, and Deng He, concentrated in Jingyan. Zhang Qingping was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the third route, leading six brigades including Xu Tingxiu, Wang Zhiren, Huang Xixuan, and Shi Zezhou, concentrated in the area between Renshou. Liu Wenhui personally led most of his troops, about eight brigades, concentrated in areas such as Meishan, Pengshan, and Jiajiang. On the sixteenth, the 24th Army began a general offensive, sending out three routes to attack the 21st Army fiercely. The 21st Army was caught off guard and suffered a major defeat, with all routes retreating below Xufu, almost to Luzhou. Liu Xiang was shocked to hear the report in Longchang and immediately moved to Zizhong, sending Commander-in-Chief Tang Shizun of the first route to lead four brigades to attack Jingyan fiercely. Wang Zhiyi of the second route led five brigades including Wang Zejun to attack Renshou fiercely. Fan Shaozeng of the third route led five brigades including Zhou Shaoxuan, Fan Nanxuan, and Meng Haoran to attack Jiading. Pan Wenhua led four brigades including Guo Xun and Fan Ziying to support the rear and mobilized ten aircraft and all artillery and machine guns to assist in the fierce counterattack against the 24th Army. On the seventeenth, Tang Shizun, Fan Shaozeng, Pan Wenhua, and Wang Zunxu's four divisions made contact with the 24th Army's Xia Zhongshi, Zhang Qingping, Leng Yindong, etc., and a great war broke out. The soldiers on the front line abandoned their rifles and used submachine guns, machine guns, fast-firing guns, and grenades to engage in fierce battles. Both sides also used daredevil teams in hand-to-hand combat. After a day of fierce fighting, the 24th Army suffered more than 16,000 deaths, Brigadier Li Yushu was seriously injured, Cheng Zimin was almost captured alive, and more than 20 regimental commanders were killed. The losses on the 21st Army side were even greater. Because the counterattack was fierce, the deaths exceeded 20,000. There are rumors that machine gun commander Liu Bingxun was killed in action. As a result, the 24th Army, unable to withstand the pressure of the opponent's air force, retreated to Jingyan, Jiading, Renshou and other places. Recently, Wang Zhiyi's troops of the 21st Army have advanced towards Renshou and have now occupied the Fajiachang and Zhangjiachang areas of Renshou. Pan Wenhua's troops have advanced to the Mataying area between Jingyan and Jiading. Tang Shizun's troops are stationed in the Qianfochang area of Jingyan. Fan Shaozeng is stationed in the Wutongqiao area of Jiading. There is also a regiment led by Liao Haitao attacking the Banqiaoxi area between Qingshen, Jiading, and Jingyan. Cheng Yinzhou's troops crossed Qianwei and advanced to Shibanxi. Liu Xiang himself has advanced to Rongxian, commanding everything, and set the date for a general attack on Jiading, Jingyan, and Renshou on the 20th. Currently, ammunition is being transported from the rear and the team is being supplemented. As for the troops stationed in Zizhong, Yang Sen, Li Qixiang, Luo Zezhou, etc., have also advanced forward. The three divisions have now occupied Guanyin Temple and Wengongchang in Renshou. However, the Chengdu side is silent and has entered a truce. However, there is now a shocking message, that the 21st Army has handed over the defense areas of the western Hubei counties to the Central Government, and Xu Yuanquan of the Central Army has sent troops to take over. Zhang Bangben, Luo Juntong, Tong Xigang, Wu Jintang, Yang Qinan and other troops returning to Sichuan are now scattered in the area of Dazhu, Linshui, Hechuan, Kaijiang, and Kaixian, all commanded by Wang Fangzhou. It is said that they are preventing Liu Cunhou's 20th Army and Yang Lin of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Army from taking advantage of the situation to attack the lower east and realize the conditions for the five-division alliance. In recent days, the Dazhu and Linshui areas have been very tense, with a storm brewing. If this matter is true, the future of the Sichuan situation will enter into a mixed war. (December 18)</p>

<h3 id="e77">Conclusion of the Jinan False Emperor Case <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Li Lechuan Kowtows, Crying Injustice</p>
<p>Madam Song Wang Utters Nonsense</p>
<p>All Four Arrested Individuals Released</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The case of the false emperor Li Lechuan and others, which once caused a sensation, was briefly interrogated by Han in the Provincial Government Hall yesterday morning and then ordered to be transported to the Public Security Bureau. At 8:00 PM tonight (the 18th), the prisoners were brought to the Provincial Government again, and Han personally interrogated them in his office. Those present included Shi Jingzhou, Chief of the Military Law Department, and Yang Jinbiao, Chief of the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau. Li Lechuan and Madam Song Wang kowtowed and refused to rise after entering the room. Han ordered them to sit, but they repeatedly said that commoners dared not sit. They finally sat after a long time. Han first said, "Don't be afraid. Perhaps you have your reasons. These are revolutionary times. Telling the truth doesn't mean anything." Li replied, "I truly dared not have any intention of becoming emperor." Han said, "I don't believe it either. One can't just become emperor so easily. I have two judgements about your case. 1) On the positive side, Buddhism has been prevalent in our country since ancient times, and believing in gods is not unusual. There are still evil cults like the Black Flag Society and Red Flag Society in Shandong. 2) On the negative side, perhaps you want to use a religious sect to gather many people. There have been many such cases throughout history, but promoting superstition is not good. You seem to be educated." Li replied, "My father died when I was seven, and I started studying at nine. In 1917 (民六), Shandong experienced a severe drought, and my mother sold over 100 mu of land..." Han said, "Even if you wanted to become emperor, you definitely couldn't do it in Jinan. It must be a religious sect. Who are your family members?" Li replied, "I have an elder cousin, Li Wenzao, who is acquainted with Zhang Weicun, a member of the Provincial Party Department, and Instructor Yan (of the private school). My family farms 80 to 90 mu of land and has no sons." Han said, "I see that you and the old lady (referring to Madam Song Wang) shouldn't be afraid. Tell the truth." Li said, "The newspapers have reported a great disaster." Han asked, "What are the oxen used for?" Li replied, "Various ceremonial items (i.e., semi-imperial paraphernalia) used in my cousin's (referring to Madam Song Wang) ancestral hall because her family had a prime minister during the Ming Dynasty and a Hanlin scholar during the Qing Dynasty." At this point, Han turned to ask the false empress Madam Song Wang, "How many sons do you have?" Madam Song Wang replied, "One. His father died when he was only one month and three days old. We have 48 mu of land. After my husband died, my relatives bullied me. I filed a lawsuit, and Magistrate Wu Baohe ruled in my favor. If my son reaches adulthood at fifteen, he will return to the Song family. If he doesn't reach adulthood at fifteen, he cannot return home. I had no choice but to take my child away." Han asked, "How do you make a living outside?" Madam Song Wang replied, "By treating illnesses." He asked, "How do you know how to treat illnesses?" She replied, "After coming out, I piously burned incense, offering 5,600 reams of paper and 3,600 sticks of incense. I held the incense while burning it, which damaged my hands and burned oil all over my body. Many women advised me not to burn anymore, so I didn't die, and they used a table to push me back. After the burns healed, I saw through the vanity of the world, didn't want to eat, didn't want property, and ate only one steamed bun every seven days, drinking plain water without salt, and then I started treating illnesses and fortune telling." He asked, "How do you tell fortunes?" She replied, "According to the Eight Trigrams and the Zodiac, I check when the sick child descended to earth, and then I tell them to find a doctor because my hands are burned and I can't use needles." He asked, "Why do you know how to treat illnesses and tell fortunes? Is it because gods or immortals are helping you? Tell the truth, it doesn't matter, I won't harm you." Madam Song Wang then kowtowed and said, "Only then do I dare to speak. After burning my hands, I no longer coveted the secular world. Although I wouldn't say I'm a god, I no longer speak ordinary words. I often tell my fellow believers that the world cannot last long and that Shandong will produce a real person to create a new world. Look at the Eastern Dipper, Western Dipper, and Southern Dipper, they have all succeeded. The Northern Dipper is the main palace. Only by believing in the Northern Dipper can you achieve peace, otherwise you will suffer a great calamity." Her followers grew daily. He asked, "How do you know the world will not last?" She replied, "I knew it after burning my hands. Wherever I go, I only drink plain water because the objects I made (referring to the semi-imperial paraphernalia) were repeatedly seized and interfered with by the authorities. The child of the Fu family was sick, and they asked me to see him. I taught them to do good deeds, ordering Elder Fu (referring to Fu Baoqi) to carry a grand feast. After going to Tai'an, they asked the palace to worship the gods. Because I came to Jinan to build a spirit tower, I settled down in Houyingfang Street, where I have lived for six years. This January, I went home, and in March, we came back together. My younger cousin (referring to Li Lechuan) came in June. When the Japanese devils were firing cannons (referring to the May 3rd Incident), I said Houyingfang Street would be fine, and Shandong would produce a real person to unify the world in peace. If a real person doesn't emerge, I am willing to be dismembered. I have never eaten salt, but after being arrested, my companions ate many beef buns, so I ate salt again. This is the truth. There is no religion. I am truly wronged." She then kowtowed again. He asked, "How do you know a new world will emerge and there will be a calamity?" She replied, "I calculated it according to yin and yang and the timing of heaven." He asked, "Who is the real person who can become emperor?" She replied, "If you approve my plea, you will definitely unify the world." Han laughed loudly at this and said, "I don't dare to become emperor, and how can you guarantee it?" Madam Song Wang suddenly said, "There has been no rain or snow this year." Han said, "If there is no rain or snow, it will be difficult to even eat, so how can you become emperor? Can you make it rain?" She replied, "With heavenly blessings, it can rain." Han said, "You have your reasons, but I don't dare to become emperor." Madam Song Wang replied, "I can guarantee that you will become emperor. If I can't, I am willing to be dismembered." Han then asked, "What is the use of the oxen you made?" Madam Song Wang kowtowed again and said, "The ox is a golden ox, a spring welcoming ox, waiting for the real person to be born. The sedan chair is stored in the Yixian Garden, and there is also a dragon bed, costing 3,600 yuan, made by a hundred princes, waiting for the real person to be born to offer tribute and seek rewards. Regarding the ox, there were negotiations a few days ago. Many carpenters who make oxen didn't know how, so I told them it was for the ancestral hall. After it was finished, I sought a pattern to give them. When making the ox, they put on clothes and fastened two flowers. However, the world is not awakened. The tower is a spirit tower, and I also made semi-imperial paraphernalia. I didn't want the flowers to be unfastened, and now I'm arrested again. Originally, I wanted to wait for the flowers to be fastened before sending them to you..." (As she said this, Madam Song Wang stood in front of Han, using a silk handkerchief in her hand, repeatedly making the shape of a flower, saying, "This is sunlight, this is moonlight, the Three Principles of the People, the blue sky and white sun.")</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, in the courtroom, you didn't kill me. When I returned, I said to my companions, "You are gracious, and you also gave us rations." I originally didn't eat, so I also bought a bowl of porridge to drink, and I bought side dishes for them to eat. Han, seeing that Madam Song Wang was babbling and seemed to have a mental illness, spoke kindly to her, saying, "Old lady, your hardships are not easy. Your husband died twenty years ago. I ask you, how much land do you have now?" Madam Song Wang replied, "I still have 60 mu." Han then turned to Li Lechuan and said, "You have studied and perhaps understand the reasoning. You can persuade her." Li said, "She is a bit confused. This time, we came to Jinan to build a tower. If the tower had been built, we would have left long ago." Han said, "Don't listen to the outside clamoring, but you should also be careful. These are revolutionary times, and parading imperial paraphernalia is too ostentatious." Madam Song Wang replied, "That's what my enemies say." Han said, "Even if you shout in the streets that you want to become emperor, I won't kill you, but you shouldn't act like this. If you are carelessly dealt with, you will be wronged. As chairman, I want to ensure the people's peace. You shouldn't shout and disturb people's hearts. I hope you don't act like this and go home to farm. And after returning home, persuade those who believe in religion in the Linyi area not to be superstitious anymore. As for you, old lady, how can you guarantee that I will become emperor? If you say you have magical powers, the gods cannot protect you. If you are shot, can the gods protect you? They definitely cannot protect you. If they could protect you, the Public Security Bureau wouldn't have been able to arrest you." At this point, the false Emperor Fu Baoqi and carpenter Zhi Huazuo were brought in. The two kowtowed incessantly. Han then asked Li Lechuan and Madam Song Wang, "I just advised you to go home and not to do such things again and to live peacefully. Do you believe what I say?" The four kowtowed together like pounding garlic and said, "We believe you, we dare not do it again." Han said, "If you cause trouble again, the government won't be able to ignore it. Alright, go home tomorrow." The four heard this and felt like they had escaped from death. They kowtowed endlessly. Han ordered them to be released that night and asked if they had travel expenses. When they said they didn't, he said he would give them some. They all said they had some. He then ordered the prisoners to be led out and released, and all the divine oxen, towers, clothes, and semi-imperial paraphernalia were left behind to be destroyed. This case was thus concluded.

<h3 id="e78">Request for Exemption from the Two-Yuan Grain Tax Increase <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>This year's winter grain tax, the Finance Department ordered the county to continue collecting an additional two yuan per stone of grain tax, as in previous years. The various agencies of the Financial Affairs Department, citing the low price of grain harming farmers and the inability of the people to pay, telegraphed the Provincial Government Finance Department to exempt them. Now, local gentry, such as Du Ruozhou, also requested exemption from the grain tax increase, citing the drastic drop in rice prices and seeking to alleviate the people's suffering, submitting separate petitions to the Ministry of Finance, the Provincial Government, and the Finance Department. The documents stated briefly: "Paying grain tax to the national treasury is the responsibility of the people, while the people's livelihood is the essence of the Party's state-building, which is what the government must do. Only by considering both can the country be rich and the people prosperous. The grain tax of five yuan has been the established system since the founding of the country. Two years ago, an additional two yuan per stone was levied for the Northern Expedition expenses, which was only a temporary expedient. Last year, following the previous example, the additional levy placed too heavy a burden on the people. We urge that it be exempted. We were graced with your instructions, stating that the additional two yuan grain tax for this year is to pay for the bandit suppression troops, and there is no way to offset it. It has been approved for one year. We see that you truly limit the alleviation of the people's livelihood. Although the price of rice was high last year, the people's burden was heavy, but they could barely manage to pay. This year, the price of rice has plummeted, and farmers' rental income is less than two-thirds of last year's. The first installment of the land price tax, along with the survey expenses, is already heavier than in previous years, and the second installment of the land price tax continues to levy an additional two yuan grain tax. Although national plans and people's livelihoods are difficult to balance, even if there is a shortage in the national plan, we can still consider making up the shortfall from other sources. As for the farmers, after the disasters of war, their savings are depleted, and it is already difficult to maintain their livelihoods. How can they have any remaining ability to pay the additional grain tax? Moreover, there was a clear order for the additional grain tax last year, how can it be extended again? We have a patriotic heart and the desire to turn stones into gold. Therefore, we request that the previous year's limited precedent be followed and that the continuation be exempted to alleviate the people's suffering."</p>

<p>The district education associations, because the administrative authorities are rectifying teachers, placing excessive emphasis on resumes and neglecting experience, and also because the banquet donations and salary increases are indefinitely delayed and the distribution of educational funds is also delayed, all of which are directly painful to the elementary school teachers. The county education association has yet to come up with effective measures. Therefore, a special meeting of district directors was convened, and it was decided that in addition to sending a letter to the county education association to find ways to negotiate, Tang Pu'an, Zhang Weikang, Zhu Yaoren, Wang Weineng, Ren Gaoben, and other five people were nominated to visit Director Zang of the Education Bureau to petition, personally delivering a presentation, stating the suffering of elementary school teachers, and requesting four points: 1) qualification issues, 2) banquet donation salary increase, 3) delayed educational funds, and 4) notification one month before the replacement of the principal. Director Zang answered each one, and the representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<p>Ma Si Bridge Town, located in the fifth district of this county, is located on the coast, and bandits can easily come and go. In the middle of last month, a kidnapping case occurred in the home of Dong Jieyuan in the town. Two young hostages were rescued from Nantong. On the day before yesterday (the 18th), another bandit alarm occurred in the town. About forty or fifty bandits, traveling on two fast boats, were detected by the local militia police, who immediately opened fire to suppress them. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle for an hour. The bandits eventually succumbed and fled. The situation is described as follows: At about 9:00 PM on the 18th of this month, several residents were returning home from a teahouse and vaguely saw two fast boats in the harbor, and there were shadows of people on the shore. Suspecting something was wrong, they crawled through the fields to observe their movements. Unexpectedly, more and more people were landing, so they ran to report to the Wangjiaqiao Militia Regiment and telegraphed the Fifth District Office to mobilize more than 30 regiment soldiers, armed with rifles and ammunition, and rushed to Ma Si Bridge. At that time, many bandits had already landed, each holding a rifle, about fifty or more people. As soon as the regiment soldiers arrived, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest, and the soldiers returned fire. The two sides exchanged fire for about 30 minutes. At that time, the county police team stationed in Si Yang also heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. The guns on both sides fired as densely as beads, and after about an hour, the bandits could not hold out and retreated. The police and regiment then chased to the riverside, but the bandit boats had already escaped.</p>

<p>Recently, red and white drug pills have been widely sold in the counties north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province. The manufacturing organization seems to be within the territory, but the person in charge has a large network, so it has not been seized. But at dawn on the 19th, the source of this evil drug was finally seized by the provincial police, shocking the whole city. On the 19th, the Jiangsu Provincial Drug Investigation Office, together with the Boxian Police Ship sent by the Civil Affairs Department, landed at Yaogang at 5:00 AM, led by Investigation Captain Li Fengwu, along with informers, and went directly to No. 372, Nanxiangzi, West Gate.

<p>(Equal Protection for Chinese and Foreign People)</p>
<p>(External Correspondence Not Yet Received)</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side has repeatedly crossed boundaries to arrest naturalized Korean residents, naturalized Korean residents in Shanghai are extremely panic-stricken. Yesterday, according to Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu's words to a China East News Agency reporter, the Chinese authorities will provide substantial protection to all Korean residents who have naturalized in China. In addition, all residents, whether Chinese or foreign, are treated equally in all places belonging to the Chinese government, with no discrimination. The previous case of the Japanese side entering the French Concession without permission to arrest Jin Cheol was not only formally protested to the Japanese Consulate by the municipal government, but also seriously negotiated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The report that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied to the municipal government to continue negotiations, the municipal government authorities have not yet received an official document. Regarding the Jin Cheol arrest case, in addition to protesting to the Japanese Consulate after the incident, the municipal government also protested to the French Consulate General, and the French Consulate has not yet responded.</p>

<p>City Party Headquarters Sends Personnel to Mediate</p>
<p>Still Unresolved as of Last Night</p>
<p>Over seventy messengers from the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Telegraph Companies collectively went on strike due to prior demands for improved treatment, leading to a labor dispute. The dispute was temporarily resolved when the General Manager, Peng Sun, avoided the issue by going to Japan, and a temporary across-the-board wage increase of two dollars was given, pending further negotiations upon the General Manager's return to Shanghai. The messengers' union, the Third District Foreign Affairs Telegraph Workers' Union, noted that the General Manager had been back in Shanghai for some time but had not mentioned the matter. Consequently, on November 25th, they again sent representatives to present nine demands to the company. However, the management repeatedly procrastinated and provided no definite response. Unable to endure it any longer, the workers held a meeting the night before last and unanimously decided to strike. The strike went into effect at six o'clock yesterday morning. After the strike, all messengers left the office and gathered at a certain location, petitioning party and government agencies for assistance. The management immediately hired over a dozen Western children to deliver important telegrams for foreign businesses. For the remaining telegrams, customers were notified by telephone and asked to send someone to pick them up. Upon receiving the report, the City Party Headquarters dispatched Dai Yongchan to mediate, contacting both labor and management to discuss reconciliation methods. However, as of last night, there was still no news of work resumption.</p>

<p>Hopes for Resolution by Next Spring</p>
<p>Information from the Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>Regarding the case of road construction by the Public Concession beyond its boundaries, it was heard yesterday that Japanese Consul General Ishii Taro had, on Saturday of the previous week, paid separate visits to the leaders of the Consular Body, Mr. 克银汉, British Consul General Mr. 利南, and Chairman of the Municipal Council Mr. 費信惇, for further substantive talks. The results of these talks have attracted considerable attention from Chinese and foreign residents in the city. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency inquired at the Japanese Consulate about the details. A spokesperson admitted that Ishii had visited the British and American Consuls General and 費信惇 on Saturday but indicated that it was not solely to discuss the extraterritorial road construction case. It was because the commander of a Japanese naval squadron circumnavigating the world was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd, and the meeting was also to arrange a meeting with them. The spokesperson continued by saying that the Japanese side had, in principle, agreed to return the extraterritorial roads to China and was currently discussing the handover procedures to facilitate signing. He believed that there would be no further opportunity for consultation before Christmas this year but was confident that a resolution could be reached early next year. Although his remarks mentioned the issue of deputy police chiefs, the request was still being pursued, but he did not specify the trend. Furthermore, his attitude was not as resolute as before, suggesting that some understanding had been reached between the two sides.</p>

<p>Where is the Japanese Bushido Spirit?</p>
<p>Second Lieutenant Nishio Takes Own Life in Shame</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: Like Major Kuken, Second Lieutenant Nishio, to live up to the spirit of Bushido, committed suicide. It has been a part of the sad history of the Shanghai Incident but has remained unpublished. The embargo on the story was lifted yesterday afternoon. The summary of the event is as follows: Nishio Jinroku, age 28, a reserve infantry second lieutenant from Kawamichi 1790, Daigo Village, Higashi Asai County, Shiga Prefecture, was appointed leader of a platoon in the 19th Regiment upon mobilization of the Kanazawa Ueda Division during the Shanghai Incident. He came to Shanghai to fight. Later, in a fierce battle at Jiangwan, he, like Major Kuken, was seriously wounded and taken prisoner by the Chinese army. After the war, he was returned to the Japanese army, but the second lieutenant deeply considered this the greatest shame to the spirit of Bushido. Overcome by a sense of self-reproach, he fell into extreme neurasthenia. After being sent back to his homeland, he refused visitors and acted cautiously. Suddenly, on the 10th of this month, taking advantage of a moment when his family was not watching, he sat properly in his room and bowed remotely to the Imperial Palace and the Ise Grand Shrine before calmly committing suicide with his family's treasured sword. Before committing suicide, on the 8th, he bid farewell to his mother, saying, "I will follow Major Kuken in committing suicide in the next day or two. I apologize in advance. My soul will permanently protect the country after death." His mother advised him to act as if he were already dead and devote himself to the country. On the 10th, he resolved to commit suicide.</p>

At approximately 10:00 AM, they changed to the special train prepared by the Longhai Railway. Because Zhang Fang, the commander of the 20th Route Army in charge of handling the aftermath of the Special Zone in Southern Henan, needed to consult with Wen Lant亭, Li Zushen, and other gentlemen regarding relief efforts in the disaster area of Southern Henan before proceeding to Beijing, they first went to Kaifeng.

<p>The Yi Luo Project under the 18th District Work Relief Bureau involved repairing 199 li of embankments, protecting over 200 villages and settlements, and over 6,300 qing of land, with an expenditure of over 237,000 yuan. An additional 116 li of canals were built under the urgent relief project, irrigating 848 qing of land, with an expenditure of 23,200 yuan. What was inspected on the 17th was the Six Embankments of the South Pass of Luoyang. They traveled by rickshaw from the station to the bank of the Luo River in front of the West Engineering Camp. When Wu Peifu was in Luoyang, he spent 300,000 yuan to build a Tianjin Bridge that spanned the Luo River. The project was quite solid, but the bridge openings were too small and the bridge deck too low, so it could not discharge water during floods. Therefore, within a year of completion, both ends were washed away by the flood, and only the middle section remains to this day. When the water rises, the flow is blocked in the middle, and the water surges sideways, causing considerable collapse on both banks. What was seen on the south bank was several zhang beyond the old bank, and the north bank was even worse. Therefore, the South Open Stone Embankment, starting near the Tianjin abandoned heap and extending to the Great King Temple, is a total of 2,208 meters long. Two rows of wooden stakes are driven into the embankment foot, and concrete and rammed earth are used to build a height of two meters. The outer slope is built with stone slabs and rammed earth. Three drainage dams, each 130 feet long, are built in the middle of the embankment, costing a total of 115,000 yuan, providing protection for Luoyang. Later, they traveled by automobile to Longmen Street to survey the Yiyang Balitang Embankment and tour the Buddha statues carved on the mountain walls on both sides of the Yique Longmen from the Northern Dynasties, numbering in the thousands, but mostly damaged.</p>

<p>At 10:00 AM on the 18th, they traveled by automobile across the Northern Mang Mountain to Mengjin, passing the place where the Dragon Horse carried the diagram, and arrived at Tiexie Town, a distance of 60 li. They proceeded another li and paid their respects to the tomb of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty. They then went to the riverbank to observe the water situation. There are embankments on the south bank of the Yellow River starting from the Pinghan Railway Bridge. Above the Iron Bridge, the Northern Mang Mountain serves as a natural embankment. However, Mengjin County is located between the Yellow River and the north of the Northern Mang Mountain, and there are no high and thick embankments along the river to prevent flooding. A request has been made to Zhong　to specially build the Han Mausoleum Dam to protect the tomb of Emperor Guangwu. Several years ago, the dam bank was eight feet higher than the riverbank, and the water did not exceed the dam even during high water. Today, however, sediment has accumulated and submerged the dam, and the riverbed is level with the dam bank. The river channel is very small in the winter when the water is low, and the Han Mausoleum Tiexie is completely submerged in the water when the water rises in the spring and summer. Residents are requesting the construction of a stone dam fifteen li long, which would require an expenditure of 100,000 yuan. However, the river body is directly facing the Guangwu Mausoleum from the bend, and the water flow rushes straight down. After passing Tiexie East, the river returns to its original course a li or so away. It is feared that a single thin embankment will not be able to defend against it. At 3:30 PM, they returned to Luoyang from Tiexie. The car traveled in the Northern Mang Mountain, up and down steep slopes, encountering danger three times, but fortunately no disaster occurred. They finally arrived at the West Station at 5:30 PM. The special train traveled east at 7:00 PM and arrived in Xuzhou at noon on the 19th, where they changed to the Jinpu Railway to travel south. After arriving in Bengbu, they transferred to Zhengyangguan to survey the Fei River Embankment and the Wuhe Huai River Embankment. (Xinsheng News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Public Concession Implements New System of Weights and Measures <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Government and Municipal Council Once Discussed Yesterday</p>
<p>The French Concession of this city had already negotiated and reached an agreement last winter regarding the new system of weights and measures, allowing the Municipal Government to send personnel to inspect at any time. However, in the Public Concession, although the Municipal Government had once discussed the matter, no formal solution has been decided. The Municipal Government believed that the failure to implement the new system in the Public Concession was unfair to the residents of the Chinese and French Concessions and would lead to many malpractices. It should be negotiated as soon as possible to resolve the issue. Therefore, at 2:00 PM yesterday, the Municipal Government invited the Public Concession Municipal Council to send personnel to discuss the matter at the Hua'an Building. The Municipal Government was represented by Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Head of the Second Section of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Huanru, and Director of the Weights and Measures Inspection Office Zhou Zanming. The Municipal Council was represented by Mr. Qiwun and Mr. Wente. According to Secretary-General Yu's statement to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Council Chairman was unable to attend in person today (i.e., yesterday), so there was no result. However, Mr. Qiwun and Mr. Wente agreed to accept this intention, and the Municipal Government believed that since the new system has been implemented in the Chinese and French Concessions for a long time, it was inappropriate for the Public Concession to be the only one not implementing it. Therefore, the Municipal Government hoped that this matter could be completely resolved in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>There are various news items from the Volunteer Army Support Association yesterday, the main points of which are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e113">Tang Jiju Sends Telegram to Thank Donors <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The troops of Tang Jiju, fighting fiercely in western Liaoning, have become increasingly strained since the withdrawal of Su Bingwen's army. The Support Association has repeatedly remitted large sums of money to provide assistance. Tang sent a telegram to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association yesterday to thank them, which stated: (Excerpt above) "I have received your telegram from General Zhu, informing me that your association has donated 5,000 yuan to our troops. Due to detailed circumstances, it has not been distributed. Our troops are not only continuing to fight, but also have a unit going to the Rehe border. If you are willing to donate, please deliver it to General Zhu in Beiping to be transferred to our soldiers. We will be extremely grateful. Tang Jiju." Note that when Tang's troops attacked Shenyang, the Northeast Volunteer Army had remitted 10,000 yuan, which was transferred by the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Beiping. Later, during the Japanese army's general offensive against Tang's troops, 5,000 yuan was remitted, which was received and transferred to the front by his adjutant, Wang Xiangshan, in Beiping. Subsequently, the Association remitted another 5,000 yuan, with 2,000 yuan directly assisting Tang and the remaining 3,000 yuan assisting the troops of Li Yiran and Sun Guanying. Due to other issues on the Li and Sun sides, the money remained with the Association and could not be remitted.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Geng Jizhou Sends Telegram to Beg for Assistance <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram yesterday from Geng Jizhou, Commander-in-Chief of the Volunteer Army in western Liaoning, briefly requesting assistance. The original text is recorded below: "To the esteemed enemies: Since the Japanese invaders attacked, the entire nation has been united in hatred. Our army, grieving the loss of our homeland and hating the rampant Japanese, is filled with righteous indignation and vows to kill the enemy to bring glory to our nation and fulfill our national duty. Therefore, we have rallied our comrades and resolved to resist Japan. We have fought bloodily for many years, and the enemy's forces have been repeatedly defeated. However, there is no undefeated army in the world, and weapons have varying degrees of sharpness. When engaging in hand-to-hand combat, the miserable sounds are unbearable to hear, and the scenes of sacrifice are unbearable to witness. Driven by righteousness, how can we bear to silence the drums and cover the flag? Although our anger is suppressed, we must continue to exert ourselves in order to drive the thieves beyond our borders and restore our homeland. Enduring hardship and pain, we vow to deal with them to the end. We first raised the banner of righteousness in Qinmin, and then divided our troops with the Liaoning Army in western Liaoning. Wherever we go, the people welcome us, and our army has been able to successively capture Jin County, Jinxi, Beizhen, Yixian, Panshan, Taian, Xinmin, Zhangwu, Faku, Tieling, Kaiyuan, Kangping, Xingcheng, and Suizhong counties, all thanks to the assistance of the people. However, our troops are numerous, and expenses are also large. We lack both food to fill our bellies and weapons to kill the enemy. Although we have received support from patriotic and righteous people from all walks of life, it is like a drop in the bucket and does not help the situation. At this moment, the weather outside the Great Wall is unusually cold, and the anti-Japanese soldiers are still without adequate clothing. The miserable situation is self-evident. If assistance is not provided quickly, it will be difficult to sustain. According to reports from Yang Yijie, our army's representative who has returned to the unit, the gentlemen of your association are highly respected, possess sincere patriotism, and are particularly concerned about our army. We are deeply grateful for your kindness and friendship. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to you, respectfully requesting your assistance so that our soldiers can fulfill their original intentions. Then the country will be fortunate, and our army will be fortunate. We have presented our urgent words and await your orders. Respectfully, Geng Jizhou, Commander-in-Chief of the Volunteer Army in western Liaoning. To the esteemed Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association."</p>

<p>Meeting to be Held Upon Arrival of Representatives from Nanjing and Anhui in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the opening of highways in five provinces and cities, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai, the issue of public security has been maintained by the authorities of each province and city independently, without a unified approach. After consultations by letter among the five provinces and cities, it was decided that each province and city would send personnel to Shanghai to discuss jointly, so that the public security along the highways could be guaranteed as soon as possible. It has now been decided that the city will send the Directors of the Municipal Public Security and Public Utilities Bureaus, as well as the Chief of the Security Office, to attend. Zhejiang Province has also appointed two people to participate in the discussion. Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, also telegraphed the Municipal Government yesterday, appointing Zhan Weiceng Yu Zhaokun to attend. The meeting will be formally convened for discussion as soon as Nanjing City and Anhui Provincial Government designate personnel to come to Shanghai. Furthermore, the Provisional Regulations for Interoperable Automobiles in Five Provinces and Cities were also promulgated simultaneously by the five provinces and cities on December 15. (Regulations omitted)</p>

<p>In order to increase its naval power for bandit suppression, the Jiangxi Provincial Government entrusted the Shanghai Naval Shipyard to build two shallow-water gunboats this autumn. Yu Weifu, Deputy Director of the Shipbuilding Department of the Shipyard, went to Jiangxi in person to negotiate and sign the contract. After Yu returned to Shanghai, construction began immediately. Most of the project is now complete, and the ships have been named Liming and Fuxing. The Fuxing is nearly complete, and the Liming was launched at the West Fort at 4:30 PM yesterday. In order to save costs, the Shipyard did not invite outsiders to visit. The two ships are each 80 feet long, 13 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and have a displacement of 100 tons. Their speed is 11 nautical miles per hour. It is said that they will be completed in the spring of next year.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city had previously received an official letter from the Municipal Government, requesting the designation of 24 to 48 labor arbitration committee members in accordance with Article 16 of the revised Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law. It is now known that the Municipal Headquarters has designated Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Gu Ruofeng, Ye Xianggao, Li Yongxiang, Li Mengnan, Ye Gonglun, Shi Yitang, Wang Zhuping, Fan Caicong, Lu Keming, and Lu Jiyun.

<h3 id="e119">Silk Cocoon Industry Cables to Request Retention of Jiangsu Industry Department <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon Industry General Association and the Shanghai Silk Mill Industry Association cabled the National Government yesterday, saying: "To the National Government of Nanjing and the Jiangsu Provincial Government: It has been reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to abolish the Jiangsu Industry Department, and all of its affiliated agencies will be closed within a year and reorganized. The matter concerns government orders, and the Provincial Government should have discretion. However, the official system is determined by the Central Government, and industry is at the forefront of public affairs. He Changzhi, governor of Jiangsu, has devoted himself to planning for the industry of this province and is especially concerned with maintaining silk cocoons. In recent years, silk cocoon varieties have been filled with inferior Japanese varieties, resulting in a gradual decline in the quality of cocoons produced. Since the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Seed Breeding Farm, various breeding farms have been happy to purchase its original seed. The establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Cocoon Industry Suppression Office has also seriously suppressed the inferior varieties and made it impossible to sell them, all of which have benefited the industry of Jiangsu. It is clear that suppressing cocoon varieties and improving silk quality is just beginning to take shape, so why should it be suspended and abandon previous efforts? We implore your government to resolutely preside over the matter and withdraw the decision of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to abolish the Industry Department, so as to rectify silk cocoons and maintain the industry. We are extremely grateful for your fairness. The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Cocoon Industry General Association Committee and the Shanghai Silk Mill Industry Association Committee respectfully knock."</p>

A corresponding letter is hereby replied to, hoping that you will check it accordingly." It is thought that the lottery tickets will disappear from the market within days.</p>

<p>The French Concession authorities, in view of the fact that residents within the concession often present large amounts of gifts to the Consul-General, the Board of Directors, and police officers during the New Year, believe that although this is a common human custom, the recipients are public officials, which is clearly contrary to the law. The French authorities believe that this bad habit needs to be actively improved and hereby notify all residents within the concession not to give any more gifts in the future, and also warn all subordinate officials to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Inland Tap Water Company Loans for Installation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Measures after Stopping Retail Delivery</p>
<p>The Shanghai Inland Tap Water Company plans to stop the retail delivery method in separate areas and on a regular basis. The northeastern and southern districts (i.e., the city and the 16th pier) are scheduled to implement this from January of the 22nd year. The company, in view of the fact that the general public may not be able to afford to install water pipes for the time being, fears inconvenience, so it plans to implement a loan installation method to promote its popularity. It is heard that the outline of this method has been approved by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. Those within the company's water supply area where road pipes have arrived but have not yet connected to tap water can refer to the outline at the company and entrust a registered plumbing shop to apply for installation and repay the installation fee in installments to enjoy clean water. This is a good method that is easy to implement.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Asia Company Not Installing Wireless Telephones in Shanghai <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A Nanjing telegram states that American Ambassador Johnson replied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Asia Electric Company has not installed wireless telephones in Shanghai to communicate with Hong Kong and other places. The report is inaccurate. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs forwarded it to the Ministry of Communications for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e128">No. 10 Public Bus to Be Divided into Three Sections <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The China General Omnibus Company, in order to meet the needs of the public, petitioned the Public Works Department to divide the No. 10 public bus route into three sections: (1) The western section runs from Wujiaochang, via Connaught Road, Xinzha Road, Beijing Road, to the Bund. When returning, it takes Suzhou Road, Sichuan Road, and makes a flat circle, then re-enters Beijing Road and returns to Wujiaochang. (2) The middle section runs from the intersection of Beijing Road and Tibet Road to Huishan Road and back. (3) The eastern section runs from the Bund via Seward Road and Ward Road to Linqing Road and back. When turning around on the Bund, it goes via Beijing Road, Sichuan Road, and Suzhou Road to Waibaidu Bridge. The company's intention is that the bus used to run the entire route (from Wujiaochang to Linqing Road), but tickets were sold in three sections. The adjustment of the number of passengers in each section and the increase or decrease in the number of vehicles was inconvenient. Therefore, it is proposed to run in sections to cope with the situation. After consideration by the Chief of the Police Department, it was believed that the proposed eastern section, running from the Bund via Beijing Road, Sichuan Road, and Suzhou Road, required three right turns, which would be very inconvenient during busy hours. It is possible to turn around on the Bund Xin Road (heavy vehicle road), which only requires one right turn at the Jiujiang Road intersection. The company stated that it was willing to follow this method, and the Public Works Department has temporarily approved it. Whether there is insurance or hindrance in turning around at the Jiujiang Road intersection in the eastern section is still under consideration by the Police Department.</p>
<p>New Year's Cards and Invitations</p>
<p>To Ensure Swift Delivery</p>
<p>Must Be Bundled Separately</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Authorities say that with the end of the year approaching, the congestion of mailing New Year's cards, etc., is inevitable. If the sender has invitations, etc., it is best to mail them separately from New Year's cards.

<p>A Fatal Telegram</p>
<p>Shop in Hometown Closed</p>
<p>Wang Yimei, a native of Fujian, over forty years old, who worked in lacquerware, brought a large batch of goods to Shanghai from his hometown on the 4th of this month to sell, lodging at No. 58 Jisheng Inn, Fujian Road, Sima Road. The day before yesterday (the 18th), his wife gave him a telegram, saying that the shop at home had suddenly been ordered to close by the troops stationed there, and asked him to return home quickly. After receiving the telegram, Wang was stunned, panicked, and temporarily lost his mind. He had the idea of dying. Last night, he secretly smoked raw opium to commit suicide. The waiter noticed and immediately sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 10:35 PM. The body was transferred from the hospital to the morgue for examination.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Appeal from Pudong Ferry Operators <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Ferry Terminal Issues</p>
<p>Lu Baokui and others from the Pudong Lannidu Ferry Business Office again submitted a document to the Municipal Government, stating: A re-submission urgently requests clear instructions. [We] respectfully received Directive No. 539 from your office, which stated: We have learned that the cross-river ferry between Dongmen Road and Dongchang Road operated by the city is different from the route of the ferry operators and is not related. The request for relief should not be considered. This reply, etc., respectfully notes that the city ferry and the ferry route are different and not related. It shows that your office is determined to carry out construction and does not lose the purpose of benefiting the people. Baokui and others have personally benefited from this and admire it. However, there is still something that must be clearly stated to your office. That is, the Jiangtian Wharf in Puxi and Dongmen Road are the berths for the ferry and the city ferry and are very close to each other. Although the routes are different, the business is affected. The public wharf in Lannidu is privately owned by the Yu family and must be abolished. Now the Dongchang Wharf has been designated by the Public Utilities Bureau as the city ferry terminal. The Lannidu Wharf has been widened by four zhang to the north and south. As a result of negotiations, once abolished, Baokui and others' ferry and the city ferry will inevitably take the same path. There will be no room for the ferry to stand. It will be abolished without being abolished, which is inevitable. Baokui and the other 37 households and hundreds of boatmen are on the verge of losing their livelihoods, and the public is panicking and cannot live in peace. The different routes and unrelated nature are only a way to seek temporary relief and are contrary to the current facts. It is still not enough to allay public concerns. For this reason, we again urge your office to clearly state the existence or abolition of Lannidu, and how Baokui and others' ferry terminal will be designated for relief after the abolition, in order to answer public doubts and alleviate worries.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Ministry of Industry, ordering the Maritime Fisheries Administration Bureau of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to send warships to strictly suppress pirates. The telegram reads: Respectfully to the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Ministry of Industry, [Name] of the Yin County Fishermen's Association telegraphed, [Name], the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai, have learned that on the 27th of last month, four fishing boats of fishermen Zheng Yexiang, Xin Yecao, Shi Jihua, Xu Aben, etc., from Dong County were robbed in the waters of Shengshan, Jiangsu, for nine days. Fishermen Wang Xingsun, Xi Xiaogen, etc., were also robbed one after another, and both people and boats are missing, with huge losses. There are still many boats that have not returned to the ocean. Investigate and report that the number of ocean fishery administration bureau guardian ocean fees collected this year is not small, but the sending of warships to patrol has not been implemented. It can be imagined that such looting has occurred repeatedly and its handling has been ineffective. In addition to separately telegraphing the Yuan and Ministry to quickly send warships to pursue and strictly punish those who are ineffective in protecting the ocean, a special telegram is sent to request that a solution be sought nearby to give strong support. The fishermen will be fortunate, and the hometown will be fortunate, etc. In view of this, it is urgently telegraphed to request that it be reviewed and that the Administration Bureau be strictly ordered to send warships to pursue and arrest those who are determined to protect the sea and not to deepen public sentiment, etc.</p>

<p>Liu Nianchun, the owner of Dingkang Gold Store on Tianjin Road, lived on North Chengdu Road. At 6:30 PM on September 13th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, Liu was returning to his residence from the store in his own car. When he arrived at the alley entrance and was about to get out of the car, he was suddenly kidnapped by three bandits who drove the driver off. The bandits drove the car and kidnapped Liu to a bandit's hideout at No. 30, Lane [Name], Tang [Name] Lane, South Pier, and monitored him. They then sent a letter to Liu's family, demanding a huge sum of money. Liu was later redeemed with a huge sum of money, and several kidnappers were arrested and executed. However, there was still one kidnapper, Yang Asi, from Tongzhou, who was responsible for guarding the hostage in the bandit's den at the time. He had been on the run for a long time and had not been arrested. Until about 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese detectives Xie Futang and Zhang Yunhong of the General Inspection Office of the General Patrol Room arrested Yang Asi in the Xinglu Lane on Broadway and took him to the patrol room for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Patrol Room lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the details of the case and requested that Yang be detained for investigation. After reviewing the confession, Judge Qian Wenji ordered Yang to be detained for another interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>Using a Car to Abduct Someone for $20</p>
<p>Li Yuzhong, a 46-year-old native of Funing, who lived in a thatched fence at No. 4 Zhongshan Road, west of the Tanziwan police station in the fourth district of Zhabei, was not yet awake at about 5:00 AM yesterday morning when a car arrived with five people on board. One person knocked on the door and entered, showed a pistol and handcuffs, and asked Li if he knew what was going on before putting Li Yuzhong in the car and driving away. Li's wife, Wang (29 years old), did not know what was going on, so she waited until about 1:00 PM before reporting to the Tanziwan police station, saying that her husband had been kidnapped by bandits. After receiving the report, Inspector Ge Weirui immediately reported the situation to the Fourth District. District Chief Liu Shirong and District Member Gou Zhixin were preparing to send detectives Xie Qihua and others to investigate when they received a phone call from the Tanziwan police station reporting that Li Yuzhong had been released. District Member Gou and others, considering that the case was bizarre, immediately ordered Inspector Ge and others to summon Li Yuzhong and Li Yushi to the case for questioning. According to Li Yuzhong, he had previously partnered with Chong Guanting and others in business and still owed Chong and others $20. That morning, Chong Guanting and his brother Chongfu, as well as three people whose names he did not know, brought pistols and handcuffs to abduct him to a small teahouse near the Li Road Bridge in the southern city to demand money. It was then mediated and $10 was paid to settle the matter. He did not know that his wife had reported to the Tanziwan police station in your district. After reviewing the confession, the magistrate ruled that carrying a pistol to extort money was too outrageous. If Wang had falsely reported a kidnapping, she should also be punished. However, the defendant had not been brought to justice and could not be verified. Therefore, it was ruled that he should be sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Discussion on the Questions Raised by Mr. Bao Zhizheng (II) <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>--Original letter see this column on the 17th of this month</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang CunSong's information: ㈠The active way to deal with the Public Security Bureau is to unite with the industry and ask the party headquarters for assistance, in order to achieve the purpose of punishing the Public Security Bureau that extorts the people. The passive way is to appeal to the public opinion and ask for unanimous assistance. ㈡Regarding the issue of making a living, you can ask local people to hold a meeting to discuss relief measures. If this request is not met, you will naturally have to make a living on your own; if you can't find a legitimate job, then "openly and boldly" continue to do your old business. Since the country doesn't feed you, why bother about whether it is legal or illegal? If you are arrested by the government for this reason, then everyone will go to jail together, anyway there is food to eat. In short, if everyone is not timid and united, there is no way not to get the final victory!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Yingjie's information: I am a young man who dropped out of school. I used to study in middle school; later, because of the stubbornness of my family, I was forced to drop out of school. At that time, I was driven by the desire to study and also made strong resistance, but in the end, because my heart was long and my strength was short, I succumbed and obeyed the strict order to go into business, but this is completely different from my temperament, so I have no interest and no vitality. However, my desire for knowledge has not diminished at all. When I am free in the morning and evening, I study hard at my desk, and I especially enjoy browsing books and newspapers. After several years, on the recommendation of a friend, I took a job in the academic world. As a result of my serious and arduous work, I was relied on by the school authorities, and it has been more than four years now. However, in recent years, the number of unemployed people in society has increased, and there are more people than positions. Even the small primary school rice bowl is in danger of being snatched away. Unfortunately, I was also among those who were rejected this year. Because of this, I am panicked in spirit and materially, and I have no solution. I have become a pitiful person who has dropped out of school and is unemployed. Every time I ask a friend to find a work-study opportunity, it is impossible. According to the current phenomenon, doing things must talk about "qualifications," and qualifications cannot be bought without "money"! Then, since I have little money and lack qualifications, how will I stand in society in the future? Unequal society, unfortunate life, please give me a bright indication!</p>
<p>Reply: We express our deepest sympathy for your fighting spirit. The "qualification" problem is indeed a kind of pain felt by many young people who have dropped out of school in modern times. We say fairly, the restriction of qualifications is to prevent the abuse of registration, indirectly to maintain the uniformity of the effectiveness of handling affairs, and not only to ask "qualifications" but not "real learning," the original intention is not too harsh; However, ordinary people often only value the virtual name of qualifications, without investigating the reality, and the value of qualifications is fundamentally lost. In fact, in our opinion, the current qualification restrictions are also limited. You see how many unqualified people rely on their bare-handed struggle and have also achieved considerable success; and how many people who have neither qualifications nor real learning rely on the "promotion" of their relatives and friends, and they will actually be among the "noble and prominent." Where is the restriction of qualifications? It's just fooling a group of poor kids! We certainly don't want to learn from the latter group of people to "flatter and run a camp," the fighting spirit of the former is indeed worthy of being our model! Therefore, what we can contribute here is only the word "struggle." Is society unfair? We must struggle! Is life unfortunate? We must struggle! "Man can definitely overcome nature." We must use continuous efforts to break through all the current difficulties: I don't believe that all the current darkness can ultimately overwhelm our courageous youth! The light is in front of us, let's rush forward!</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Jiean's information: ㈠We are born in this muddy society. The temptations and pressures from the outside world are so severe. How can we continue to maintain our personality and not be assimilated into the vulgar customs? ㈡Life is always inevitable to have times of sorrow and pain. When this situation comes to our heads, how can we prevent ourselves from being decadent? ㈢If we want to accomplish a career or learning, we must go through many twists and turns and difficulties. How can we not shrink back halfway?</p>
<p>Reply: Although the questions in the letter are divided into three items, the reason is only one point, that is, the issue of personal "will." If a person has an extremely strong will, no matter what difficult blows and evil temptations, they will not make him succumb; conversely, if a person has no will, then everything is impossible to talk about, and in the end, they can only go with the flow. There will never be any success! As for the cultivation of will, it must of course rely on one's own cultivation. On weekdays, whenever something comes to hand, we should first conduct a detailed observation, judge its right and wrong, and once right and wrong are determined, we should hold on to the courage to proceed, regardless of any difficulties in front of us. This great courage is "will." To have this courage, first, we must recognize the true nature of the universe and life clearly, and second, we must have a strict distinction between the concepts of profit and harm; generally speaking, it is to have a "broad vision." People with short-sightedness will never have any "will." To sum it up again, the explanation of will is "not afraid" and "not confused." If a person can be "not afraid" and "not confused," they can also deal with everything.</p>

<p>Plans to Take Over Various Affiliated Institutions of the Former Industry Department</p>
<p>Striving to Integrate Production and Education</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, attaches great importance to livelihood education and considers it one of the central tasks of the department. The plan to improve livelihood education is also being carefully studied. Now, because the Jiangsu Industry Department has been abolished, many of its affiliated institutions, such as provincial and county farms and factories, can be used for education. Therefore, in order to increase the efficiency of vocational education in schools and to popularize livelihood education among the general public, it is heard that Director Zhou has obtained the consent of the chairman and plans to take over the affiliated institutions of the former Industry Department that can be used for education and put them under the jurisdiction of the Education Department, so that various vocational schools, social education institutions, and county junior and senior primary schools can make full use of them, striving to integrate production and education and achieve the effect of livelihood education. Currently, the nature, content, location, funding, and other items of various affiliated institutions are being investigated. After the investigation is completed and the proposal is submitted to the provincial government for approval, they will be taken over separately. How to reorganize and how to use them after the takeover is a pioneering initiative in education, and the department is also carefully studying and planning in detail.</p>

<p>About 4,000 Students Participating in the Examination</p>
<p>Four Days Starting from January 16</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province attaches great importance to the joint graduation examination for students. In the first semester of this year, a joint graduation examination for high school students was held once, which yielded great results. Now, it is found that this semester is about to end, and there are more than 3,000 graduates from junior high school and more than 100 graduates from high school, who urgently need to continue to hold the examination. Therefore, the Provincial Government Committee decided to establish a "Hunan Provincial Middle School Student Graduation Joint Examination Committee," and recommended He Jian as the chairman, Zhu Jingnong as the vice chairman, and Luo Dafan, Huang Shiheng, Huang Jiasheng, Wang Taizhong, Xia Kaiquan, Yang Naikang, Duan Bijiang, Luo Chuanju, Xie Zuyou, Jiang Lou, Ouyang Gangzhong, and others as committee members.

<h3 id="e161">News from the Ministry of Education <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Recent Educational News from the Ministry of Education is compiled below: ⑴ After the resignation of Shen Yinmo, the president of Peking University, the Ministry of Education proposed Xu Songming as his successor, which was approved by the Central Government. Xu telegraphed repeated declinations after receiving the official appointment. After sincere attempts to retain him, Xu formally assumed office on the 19th and telegraphed the Ministry of Education for records. ⑵ The Ministry of Education and the National Compilation and Translation Bureau jointly hired Zhu Kezhen as a member of the Astronomical Terminology Committee. ⑶ Several months ago, the Ministry of Education hired Bai Dizhou, a standing committee member of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, as the supervising committee member for the re-production of phonetically notated gramophone records by the National Language Education Promotion Association. At that time, four records were supervised. There were no problems with records one, two, and three, but the fourth record still needed revisions. After several months, it should have been finalized. The Ministry of Education sent a letter to the committee member yesterday asking whether the fourth record had been completely revised and whether it could be approved, and requesting that the review opinions be submitted to the Ministry for review and handling. ⑷ Consult the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the expenses for participating in the Olympic World Games be quickly allocated. ⑸ Jointly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, submitted a report to the Executive Yuan requesting that the Ministry of Finance be ordered to allocate funds to clear the debt of Chinese government-funded students at Columbia University. ⑹ The Ministry of Military Affairs sent an official letter stating that the Military Affairs Committee ordered that national military education should be inspected monthly by senior military officers stationed in the area and reported to the Ministry of Military Affairs for record. A special letter was sent to inquire and provide relief. ⑺ The Executive Yuan issued an instruction stating that the case of disbanding the Taiyuan Student Union, which was handled by the Central Government, has been ordered to be strictly suppressed by the Shanxi Provincial Government. A special order was issued for notification.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Preliminary Plan for Reforming Chinese Education Suggested by the League of Nations Education Inspection Group (Continued) <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>High Quality Improvements Should be Made to Higher Education</p>
<p>Foreign Textbooks Should Disappear from Secondary Schools</p>
<p>(B) Secondary education should not only be a preparation for entering university, because only a small portion of secondary school graduates can go on to higher education. Vocational schools and normal schools actually constitute an indispensable part of secondary education. The strength of normal school graduates can ensure the unity of primary and secondary education. Vocational education must be emphasized and further developed, so that students with talent can rise from lower-level vocational education to the highest level. (C) Higher education should be greatly improved in quality. There are too many universities in various cultural centers. On average, five students require a fully learned teacher to spend all or part of their time, which is unreasonable. If several competing universities in one location cannot be completely unified, then strive for their cooperation to curb wasteful competition. Private universities or specialized schools that do not adhere to this cooperation to support a national, efficient education system should not be allowed to be established.</p>
<p>(IV) Efficient Teaching. (A) All teachers must be proficient in the subjects they teach, not just in their teaching methods. Basic education in history and psychology is valuable, but should not neglect the teaching materials themselves because of such studies. (B) Lectures should be based less on textbooks and more on experiments and practical work (especially in science) and reference books (in history and language). (C) The number of lecture hours in all schools should be reduced, and the number of hours in laboratories and manual work should be increased comparatively. (D) Specialized terminology in science should be standardized. Foreign textbooks should disappear from secondary schools. This is necessary. The study of European languages (such as English) must enable graduates of general courses in secondary schools to use modern scientific texts in universities. Establishing specialized scientific terminology in Chinese is a most urgent task that the Ministry of Education should promote (a special committee should be organized by hiring European experts). (E) The government should ensure that all scientific institutions are fully equipped with instruments manufactured in China. These instruments can be manufactured by private or public factories.</p>
<p>Preliminary Plans in Urgent Need. (I) A special committee should be sent to Europe as soon as possible to study the organization of school administration in European countries. The personnel sent should be experienced people, and they should be expected to be the leaders of the transformation in the future. We believe that Chinese experts who are familiar with the situation and educational administration methods in Europe are more beneficial than inviting European experts to come to Nanjing. However, if the Ministry of Education wants to obtain a competent educational administrator from Europe as an assistant, the League of Nations will be willing to help find a competent expert. This person should not only have been trained in a certain part of educational administration, but must also have broad and thorough practical experience. If such an expert can come to China, he should be at the disposal of the Chinese government at any time to assist in everything, for a period of at least one year. (II) We further suggest that China should send experts to Europe to study teaching materials, curriculum, etc. (III) The investigations that must be carried out locally in the areas selected for the first pilot projects of compulsory education should be prepared in time, and publicity to the public must be carried out to prepare psychologically in order to eliminate illiteracy. (IV) The necessary regulations for various administrative committees should be drafted immediately, and the Ministry of Education should appoint leaders from the academic and other fields to organize a university administrative meeting to discuss plans for reforming university education. (V) The problem of determining specialized scientific terminology should be studied immediately. (End)</p>

<p>| One Loss and One Win in Suzhou |</p>
<p>(Suzhou Correspondence) The Zhejiang University basketball team from Hangzhou came to Suzhou on the 19th to compete with the Soochow University team. Due to the unfamiliar venue and the fatigue of travel, they were miserably defeated by the Soochow University team, who waited for them in good condition. At 5:00 PM on the 20th, they had a friendly match with the Jiangsu Coaches Team at the Soochow University Gymnasium. There were no fewer than 400 spectators. The Jiangsu Coaches Team had two veterans from East China, Feng Jiasheng and Wang Shoufang, plus three strong players from the Soochow University team. Their strength was stronger than Soochow. After the start of the game, Zhejiang University led all the way, sweeping away yesterday's depression. The whole team cooperated well, the passing was agile, and the strange ball of Wang Pusheng, the "ball monster", added a lot of color to Zhejiang University. At the end of the first half, Zhejiang University won 22 to 20.</p>
<p>After the lemon break, the battle continued. The Jiangsu Coaches Team used long-range shooting to increase their score sharply. Zhejiang University changed their tactics and used short passing to attack, which was indeed effective. However, because the ball did not cling to the basket, the ball often rolled out of the basket, which was to no avail. As a result, Zhejiang University won by 37 to 36 by one point.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang University basketball team will take the express train to Shanghai tonight. The order of matches in Shanghai is scheduled as follows:</p>
<p>Date Team Location</p>

<p>Wonderful Performance of West Qing Basketball</p>
<h3 id="e176">Hujiang Defeats St. John's <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>| Result: 57 to 35 |</p>
<p>| St. John's Lost Because Their Attackers Could Not Defend |</p>
<p>| Soochow Wins West Qing (Group B) |</p>
<p>Relying on their agile figures and superb skills, the Hujiang athletes were able to defeat the St. John's basketball team with a score of 57 to 35 in yesterday's West Qing Group A game. At that time, more than 100 Hujiang students, both male and female, sat around, cheering and shouting, singing together, and their joy was almost indescribable. After the game, the Group B Soochow vs. West Qing game followed, and as a result, Soochow won 42 to 27. Soochow led 19 to 16 in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Frequent Whistles <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>St. John's and Hujiang are long-time rivals in the basketball world. In recent years, St. John's players have left the school one after another, and their strength has been weaker. Hujiang is the opposite. With elite troops and sufficient supplies, they are invincible. At the beginning of the fierce battle, they were anxious and their hands did not follow their commands. Either they went too far or they did not reach the goal. The sound of free throws was frequently heard, and the warriors were frightened. Chen Xianglong committed the first foul, and Hujiang's Sun Baoqing scored the first point. Hujiang's Tao Zunan followed, committing a foul again and again, and Qian Jingyong also got a point. In the blink of an eye, Hujiang's Cheng Jingsheng, a surprise soldier, came out of the gate, shooting a basket diagonally. Chen Xianglong charged into the battle alone. After waiting for him to retreat, he was supported from behind. The Hujiang army was calm and powerful, soaring straight down, and in less than ten minutes, they led by 11 to 2.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Handling with Ease <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Turning to this battle, driving a light car and taking a familiar road, the balls of both sides flowed into the basket like shooting stars, unlike the previous failed attempts. The anxiety had disappeared, and they were handling it with ease. Almost every minute and every second, they all had the opportunity to build achievements. In comparison, if St. John's scored a ball, Hujiang would retaliate with a follow-up shot, and sometimes even added interest. St. John's three forwards were good at shooting baskets, and the inner guard Sun Baoqing also strongly supported them. Invisibly, Hujiang had already taken the upper hand. At the end of the first half, Hujiang was 27 and St. John's was 14.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Honorable Retirement <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Starting the second half, St. John's was very brilliant. The whole army fought together, and the attack and defense corresponded to each other. The reason for St. John's previous defeat was that the forwards could not take care of the defense. The inner guards Wu Youliang and Tao Zunan had increased responsibilities, and often used the strength of two people to jointly resist the activities of the five tigers. The contribution of Wu and Tao was the crown of the whole team. Not long after the battle, Tao first made a remarkable contribution, scoring a ball and hitting a free throw, and Hou Xuemin also won two more points. Five points had been obtained, and St. John's had a million appearances, and victory was in sight. At that time, Tao was sent off the field with four penalties. Tao retired honorably and could be said to be without shame, but the team's sharpness gradually declined and it was difficult to recover.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Deserved Reputation <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Three Special Points of Shanghai College: Quick Dribbling, Accurate Throwing, Excellent Teamwork. This is Where St. John's Falls Short. Although St. John's Sometimes Came Close, They Gradually Fell Behind. Artistry Has Its Highs and Lows. In the First Ten Minutes, St. John's Scored More Points Than Shanghai College. However, Over Time, Shanghai College Relied on Their Strengths and Rose Steadily. The Scoreboard Showed a Significant Difference. In the End, Shanghai College Won 57 to 35.

<p>Zi Qiang Team Wins Group A Championship</p>
<p>Nan Xun Team Wins Group B Championship</p>
<p>(Jiujiang Correspondence) Jiujiang's sports scene has long been considered dull, and past results have been extremely poor. Since Long Zexian came to Xun, he has vigorously promoted sports, and the atmosphere has gradually become more enthusiastic. Whenever there is an important competition, the audience always exceeds one thousand people. This time, Long Zexian, the sports director of the Provincial Fourth Middle School, joined forces with Zhu Chuikai and Huang Yi to jointly launch the Jiujiang Winter Basketball Championship. On the one hand, it promotes sports throughout the city, and on the other hand, the ticket proceeds are donated to the Northeastern Volunteer Army. A total of ten teams participated in this competition, divided into Group A and Group B, with five teams in each group. The competition method adopted a knockout system. The winner of the final in Group A was the Si Zhong Zi Qiang team, a perennial winner in the city, and the Qiang Hua team, organized by most of Jiujiang's sports enthusiasts. The winners of the final in Group B were the Jiujiang Railway Bureau Team B and the Lian Xi Vocational School. The finals were held at the Provincial Fourth Middle School basketball court at 3 PM on the 17th. As a result, the championship in Group A was won by the Provincial Fourth Middle School Zi Qiang team, and the championship in Group B was won by the Nanxun Railway Bureau Team B. The results were satisfactory and represent a good phenomenon for inland sports. The details of the competition are as follows:</p>

<p>In the Group B final, the Nanxun B athletes were tall and strong, and fiercely contested for the ball. The Lianxi players were small and thin, and were outmatched. As a result, Nanxun B won. The Group A final followed, with Huang Song as the referee. The atmosphere was exceptionally tense. The Zi Qiang team is known as a perennial winner in Jiujiang, and their passing and shooting are excellent. The Qiang Hua team is made up entirely of sports teachers, and their experience is not inferior to that of Zi Qiang. Unfortunately, their coordination was lacking. The result of the first half was 22 to 8. Although the Qiang Hua forwards were very valiant, the Zi Qiang defenders were tight and impenetrable. As a result, Zi Qiang won 47 to 31. The basketball championship, which caused a sensation in the city, came to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p>Yesterday, from the external observation of financial business, nearing the end of the year, various 款項 urgently need to be summarized. The busyness of the procedures goes without saying.

<p>Actual demand for cotton yarn is increasingly sluggish due to tight financial conditions. Various merchant groups have also turned to stagnation. The yarn market in Guangdong and other places is poor, hence the market is depressed. The initial enthusiasm is gradually dissipating. However, some still have interest in going long due to the rise in raw cotton prices. It is said that Rongxing will close out a large number of long positions this month.</p>

<p>The pre-market opening for marked yarn was sluggish. The raw cotton price fell in the second and third sessions, weakening the situation further. As a result, each month fell by 9 qian to 1.1 taels. News of sluggish actual demand came in the afternoon, and the opening was down by 3 qian. Raw cotton prices suddenly rose in the second and third sessions, driving the yarn market up, but the closing was soft again. Near-month contracts fell 1.24 qian, while far-month contracts were flat.

<p>Manufacturers have confirmed purchasing coarse cotton in producing areas.</p>
<p>The cotton market is fluctuating and uncertain, rising and falling abruptly, leaving people confused. However, general speculators believe that domestic cotton production is insufficient for factory use, and the prices of Indian and American cotton are difficult to come to Shanghai due to the influence of precious metals. Therefore, most are inclined to purchase cotton. However, a certain manufacturer in Tianjin and Shandong production areas has indeed purchased 4,000 bales of coarse-grade cotton, which have already been loaded onto ships and are being transported to Shanghai. Therefore, the market conditions in the near term have shown slight slackness.</p>

<p>丨150,000 to 160,000 Bags Transacted Yesterday丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for all months were slightly weak due to the large amount of foreign wheat purchased by various large and small factories in recent days, which has satisfied their appetite. Foreign merchants are still actively selling. Yesterday, the price of foreign wheat also decreased slightly, and the appetite of Dalian merchants also temporarily stopped. Therefore, market sentiment was downward. However, in the afternoon, Tianjin merchants suddenly came to the market to actively seek recent and spot flour, with a strong appetite. 150,000 to 160,000 bags of spot and near-term flour were transacted on the day, and the market was immediately lifted. Before closing, it triggered short covering by floating long and scattered short positions, and market sentiment was even better. Closing prices: December up 1.15 points, January up 2 points, February up 1.75 points, March up 2 points, April and May up 0.075 points each.</p>

<p>丨Limited Arrival of Red Machine Rice, Half-Angle Premium丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a continued arrival of Hakka Xiang rice, and sales were still mainly to Min merchants.囤户 (speculators) and North merchants also inquired, but Su province rice can be exported within this week, therefore囤户 and North merchants are searching for river bottom (河下) rice, so they are watching the Hakka Xiang rice appetite. Fortunately, Min merchants still have high appetite, and holders are firm in their position, and the market is still firm. Yesterday, 200 bags of Wuhu machine round rice were opened, priced at 9 yuan and 5.5 jiao, and 300 bags of Hunan machine oil rice were opened, priced at 8 yuan and 5.6 jiao. Also, 440 bags of machine red rice were opened, priced at 8 yuan 3 jiao to 0.05 fen. The amount of machine red rice stored in the market is low. Both north and south merchants' appetites are active. Due to demand exceeding supply, the price has risen by half an angle compared to the previous day. There has been no import or export of foreign rice for a long time, and there are still 450,000 bags in stock, all in the hands of foreign merchants. 3,000 bags were transferred last week, and the market is still in a dismissed situation.</p>

<p>This week, the wheat market initially rose due to the strength of Winnipeg wheat, but then fell due to general selling. As a result, it was down 0.375 to 0.625 points compared to the previous day. Also, the volume traded on the 17th was 10 million bushels. The market prices for the 19th are listed on the left:</p>

<p>No. 2 white lead sheet is in short supply of spot goods, and various merchants actively purchase it. Market prices are trending tightly and lively. The standard jumps wildly by two or three taels. For example, small barrel spot goods open at 28.5 taels, and large barrels at 28 taels. It is heard that tea merchants have begun to collect them, and it is feared that 30 taels will soon appear.</p>

<p>US Steel is extremely good, and the demand for delivery is strong, but goods are lacking. The standard is rising sharply. It is estimated to be 4 taels. All fellow merchants are sending telegrams to inquire about overseas products. According to the reply, there are no goods in the near months. It is necessary to wait until April or May of next year to be certain.</p>
<p>Also received overseas metal market, London, 19th telegram, steel, lead, zinc are slightly up, tin is slightly down, copper price increase due to lack of sellers, electrical copper demand is more, and the United States wholesale long-term closed mines, since April to date, inventory is sold out, antimony tungsten unchanged.

<p>Because Chaoqing Jiazha (軋脚) price cannot be too high.</p>
<p>Yesterday the sugar market had bonded falls, but actual sales were active, so the trend of the guild's pricing was still good. No. 24 coarse sand white was priced at 15.5 taels, up 0.025 taels from the previous day. High-grade RA mark was 15.575 taels, up 0.05 taels because of the small amount of goods. No. 18 medium sand white was priced at 14.4 taels, with prices for goods higher than No. 20, up 0.075 taels. Nos. 8, 9, and 10 Dutch red sugars were similar to before. New Chaoqing's situation has stabilized. Continued issues of five or six hundred bales of goods, with the higher price being 8.9 taels, and the next level at 8.5 taels. Jianbang distributors issued dozens of boxes of Lion Ball White Ice Sugar, priced at 10.01 taels per 砠. Five Happiness White Ice Sugar continues to be issued, with the price still at 11 taels. Yesterday, New Zhang Diaotang was imported from Xiamen by the Taiyuan ship, and the first batch of goods has been transported, totaling only 184 pieces, and no samples have been seen yet. It is estimated that the opening price for good goods will probably not exceed 10 taels, because Chaoqing is currently said to be falling quite a bit, and Diaotang cannot solely occupy the advantage.</p>
<p>Also received New York telegram dated the 19th, spot sugar market unchanged, still 0.08125 dollars per pound, futures 1.79, September up a point per pound, remaining months unchanged. Also, London telegram on the same day, December and March up 0.5 pence each, May up 0.025. Also, Java telegram, white sugar unchanged, still 8 shillings 1.5 pence (120 pounds).</p>

<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e221">Hankou Telegram Shows Bai Tong Oil Falling <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Bai Tong Oil's market is fluctuating, and rises and falls have not exceeded 2, which has been the case for months since the new oil was produced. Sometimes it is lively, and sometimes it is weak, but still has no great development. Distributors in other ports handled a batch of Zhejiang road earlier. Recently, settlement has been due, so those transported by train in recent days are purchases of futures settled previously, not the current market transaction. The price seems to be slightly weaker than before, and usually only rises and falls by a few jiao. The future forward price was between 23.24 yuan and 23 yuan per 砠, while recently it has been between 22.56 yuan. According to Zhejiang road oil mills, they are unwilling to reduce prices further due to cost reasons, and the situation seems to be stabilizing. However, according to a telegram from Hankou the day before yesterday, the source of Xiang Tong is strong, and prices have fallen to 13 taels per customer. The Hankou market is cheaper than the Zhejiang market. Compared to the current market, Hankou Tong oil is cheaper than Zhejiang Tong oil. Local distributors in this port have already abandoned Hankou and switched to Zhejiang in recent years. Now that Hankou Tong oil is already calculated, perhaps this can change the line of sight again, abandoning Zhejiang and switching to Hankou is also within expectations. If Zhejiang Tong oil can be affected by Hankou, and prices fall accordingly, then buyers will always choose the cheaper option.</p>

<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>"Not hungry? Such a big man eating so little."</p>
<p>"Not hungry. How come you're here all alone?"</p>
<p>"The whole family is dead." Her eyelids reddened, and she wanted to cry again. I quickly kept silent, and after a while, when she was better, I said, "What happened?"</p>
<p>"They fought, and wiped out my whole family."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Where can I go?"</p>
<p>"Where are you planning to run?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't planning on running anywhere. I took a few pancakes, and ran all the way here. What about you?"</p>
<p>"I didn't even bring food. Not getting killed by the soldiers is already great luck. How can I plan where to run? I'll just go wherever I can."</p>
<p>At that time, she and I sat closer and closer together. I waved my hand and touched her hand. I smiled, and moved my body a little, very embarrassed.</p>
<p>"You should still sit further away?"</p>
<p>So I moved away a bit, sitting far apart talking.</p>
<p>It was really getting late. The stars in the sky were so dense, pushing each other, as if trying to push someone down. The grass outside the pavilion was all wet with dew, and a few upside-down trees in the distance stretched their branches towards the moon. A gust of wind blew, and I felt a little cold. Outside the pavilion, a night bird cried out, its voice strange enough, like a ghost crying, making one's heart cold, followed by a gust of wind. She shrank her neck and shivered. I glanced at her.</p>
<p>"You should still sit closer?" she said.</p>
<p>"Are you cold?"</p>
<p>"I'm scared."</p>
<p>I moved over and sat down next to her. Just as I touched her body, she flinched and said, "You won't..." Looking at me.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>So she leaned on me and said, "I'm tired!"</p>
<p>And closed her eyes.</p>
<p>I looked at her, and all my fatigue and loneliness disappeared. I thought, I am not living in the world alone, I am with her in this pavilion—we are two people.</p>
<p>The next day, she had flushed cheeks and disheveled eyebrows. The virginity in her eyes was stolen by a thief last night. She looked at the sky, looked at the sun, and then looked at me, and suddenly covered her face and cried. I didn't dare to say anything. I knew I had done something wrong. She cried for a long time before raising her head and pointing her finger at my nose and saying, "It's all you!"</p>
<p>I lowered my head.</p>
<p>"You said you wouldn't."</p>
<p>"I didn't expect it."</p>
<h3 id="e246">"Elegance" and "Vulgarity" <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Du Heng</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a trend in literary works of using a large amount of vulgar language, as if it is not enough to show populism without it. The so-called vulgar language here of course specifically refers to that curse that involves a woman's particular organ, namely the Shanghai phrase "Nao Niang" (pronounced like "Na Niang") and the various derivations of the same phrase in other places. Originally, for the sake of conveying the spirit of spoken language, using a few of them appropriately is not only permissible but also necessary; but using them in excessive amounts, even in narratives, in descriptions, and even in poems, then it implicitly becomes a promotion. This kind of promotion, even if it cannot be said to be particularly undesirable, is at least as particularly undesirable as promoting "national essence." Using phrases like "Nao Niang" to curse people, gradually the curser no longer considers it a significant insult, and the cursed person seems to be able to handle it calmly. Thus, there are cases of cursing a son but actually not cursing at all, and cases of cursing siblings without feeling "incestuous," and even more gradually, this cursing simply ceases to be cursing. It is merely regarded as a kind of exclamation mark in speech, used to emphasize tone. This is really because our popular spoken vocabulary lacks a word that can be used to emphasize tone. Something can be bad to the extent of "Nao Niang," and at the same time it can be good to the extent of "Nao Niang": if this is still cursing, then it is simply firing blanks. In short, it has become a phrase with sound but without meaning.</p>
<p>It is indeed common to use these words frequently in popular spoken language, but we also feel that it is not necessary to tack one onto every sentence; even if there are people who tack one onto every sentence, they are ultimately not the majority. Those who use it the most are still our writers. The reason is probably because our writers feel that these words are very striking, so they always grab it as the unique feature of popular spoken language.</p>
<p>Opposite to "vulgar" is "elegant." I think the most elegant spoken language should be that of people from Beiping.</p>
<p>This elegance is also partly politeness. Indeed, anyone who has been to a Beiping restaurant must imagine that China is the most polite nation. However, this restaurant-style politeness may not be purely politeness, and contains a hint of "small change," so it is not very reliable. Then I can cite another example.</p>
<p>For example, if a rickshaw with passengers wants to overtake a rickshaw without passengers, then the rickshaw driver will say "Lao Jia" (excuse me). As for things like the person in the back bumping into the front and then cursing the person in front for "not having eyes," that kind of thing is generally unheard of.</p>
<p>"Lao Jia" is a very common phrase in northern spoken language, yet it is very elegant. There is no way to say it using less elegant words; the forced translation would be "With your chariot's toil." "Jia" is derived from horse, and in ancient China, the most common means of transportation was horse-drawn carriage, so it can be seen that this phrase has been around for a long time. Entrusting you to do something means asking you to sit in your chariot to do it, how courteous.</p>
<p>The "Lao Jia" in the mouth of a rickshaw driver can of course be interpreted as "With your chariot's toil," but from the point of view of the "Jia" character being derived from "horse," then this polite phrase has become no less of an insult than "Nao Niang." The rickshaw drivers do not think of "Lao Jia" as asking people to sit in a horse-drawn carriage, but as asking people to "Jia" the rickshaw like a horse—that kind of "toil." Therefore, this elegant word, it can be said, is just like that vulgar word, people only remember the sound and forget the meaning.</p>
<p>Our ideal language is one that neither uses "Lao Jia" to replace "Please move aside," nor uses "Nao Niang" to replace...replace what?</p>
<p>Replace everything.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Random Jests by Bao Qiao <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>Bao Qiao (Poggis), an Italian satirist of the 14th century, born in 1380, authored a volume of humorous anecdotes, a genre quite similar to our country's "Laughing Grove Wide Records," mocking clerics, literati, noblewomen, and wealthy merchants with concise wit. While some jokes are ribald, they are not obscene. In literature, there is a special talent for this kind of work. In England, it's Swift (Swift), in France, Voltaire, and Rabelais. In our country, Li Yu of the Lake, is a comparable figure. Now, I have transcribed and translated several anecdotes by Bao to entertain the readers.</p>
<p>A noblewoman, whose husband was an ambassador, had been away for a long time. One day, a postman asked her if she had any letters to send to her husband. She replied, "How can you expect me to write letters when my husband took his pen with him, leaving only an empty inkwell at home?"</p>
<p>A man living in the city of Cu Piao, named John, was troubled because he couldn't figure out a way to detect if his wife was having an affair. Later, after racking his brains, he came up with a brilliant plan. He castrated himself! This way, if his wife were to have a child, then she must have committed adultery.</p>
<p>In the village of Biergola, a mountain man was about to marry a girl from his neighbor's house, but after carefully examining her, he claimed that the girl was too delicate and too young, and he refused to marry her. But her dull-witted father retorted, "She has grown up so much that you don't believe it, and the facts can prove it. She has already given birth to three children for the priest in our parish."</p>
<p>Prince Barnabo of Milan was very fond of women. One day, he was flirting with a woman he favored in a secluded spot in the imperial garden. Unexpectedly, a priest, a confessor, came by. Because of his wisdom and experience, he had the privilege to approach the prince. Barnabo blushed instantly and felt very embarrassed. But he immediately came up with a devious question to ask the priest: "If you had such a woman in your bed, what would you do?" The priest immediately replied, "Of course, I know very well what I should do, but I don't know what I would do." This answer eased the prince's predicament.</p>
<p>A Florentine man was away from home. He didn't return home until the end of the year, and his wife was in labor. So he suspected his wife of infidelity. He went to inquire of an experienced old woman in the neighborhood whether there were any children born after twelve months of pregnancy. The old woman replied, "Of course there are. If your wife saw a donkey on the day she conceived, she would have to carry the baby for twelve months like a donkey." The husband, after hearing this, actually believed it, and thanked the old woman very much for dispelling his doubts and saving his wife from embarrassment. He finally gladly became the father of the child.</p>
<p>In Florence, a young woman was exceptionally foolish. During childbirth, the baby would not come out for a long time. The midwife held a candlestick and examined her. The woman moaned, "Look over there too, because my husband has worked over there a few times."</p>
<h3 id="e248">Returning from the Esperanto Exhibition <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>In a small room in a Western-style building across from the grand and lively Northeastern Refugee Relief Carnival at its opening, there was an atmosphere of peace and tranquility. The table was covered with colorful books. Striking and touching slogans were posted on the walls, and colorful pictures and stamps were hung, all with a foreign flavor. Indeed, they came from foreign lands, from the ends of the earth. A beautiful and melodious language, neither Mandarin, nor English, nor Japanese, nor any national language, continuously entered the ears. Dozens of young people with hopeful faces browsed through various strange books and newspapers. Furthermore, the most noteworthy thing that caught the eye was the five-pointed green star badge.</p>
<p>This was the first Esperanto exhibition held in Shanghai, perhaps in China!</p>
<p>Anyone who stepped into this room would feel that it was filled with a sense of world consciousness and a peaceful atmosphere. When that solemn song "La Espero" ("Hope") was played from the gramophone, listeners temporarily forgot the noisy and contentious world and longed for a utopian "One World."</p>
<p>Noteworthy in the venue was a framed mirror hanging on the center wall, filled with charred fragments of paper, with several lines of barely legible words in Esperanto. It turned out that these were souvenirs left to us by the god of war. They tell us that the efforts of our Eoperantisioj over the years, like everything else, have suffered the same fate under the tyranny of the god of war.</p>
<p>The second noteworthy thing was that among the Esperanto books and newspapers displayed at the exhibition, publications from Japan and newly emerging countries after the war, such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, accounted for a large proportion, while Esperanto publications in our own country were as rare as phoenix feathers. This may be one of the motivations for holding this exhibition.</p>
<p>Anyone who attends and browses through the various books and newspapers will always see the activity of the overseas labor movement. Looking back at the country, one can only sigh. It is hoped that comrades engaged in the world movement can devote some effort to activities in this area in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Four Great Writers Send Congratulatory Telegrams to Gorky <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Xian</p>
<p>The greatest Soviet writer, Gorky, began his literary career in 1892, and this year marks the 40th anniversary. In order to commend his great contribution to the revolution, the Soviet government held a grand celebration on September 25 of this year. Many famous writers from various countries sent congratulatory telegrams. The following are selected translations of congratulatory telegrams from four great writers, including Shaw,</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p>There are few writers whose works transcend national borders, but Gorky is one of them. In the pre-revolutionary nineteenth century, the first Russian writers to move the hearts of Englishmen were Turgenev and Tolstoy, followed by Dostoevsky, and finally Gorky and Chekhov. Among these, only Gorky made revolution seem possible.</p>
<p>Other writers produced confusing impressions of society, the state, and people, that society was fundamentally terrible, those people were either more luxurious than Peter the Great and the courtiers of the Second Bian Saling era, or (as in Chekhov's novels and plays) were more boring than any characters one could encounter in English and American works similar to the Cherry Orchard. They seemed completely incapable of creating a revolution that ought to be more advanced than America, and more civilized than Berlin, Paris, or London.</p>
<p>Gorky's depiction of Russia is indeed not excessive. He understood the bottom layer of Russia better than other writers (who can all be regarded as gentlemen writers). Although that depiction is darker, as a proletarian literary work, its authenticity has a quality that is lacking in the novels of gentleman writers, whose only ability is to romanticize the surrounding phenomena.</p>
<p>Despair disappeared because of him. The Russian proletariat described by Gorky is filthy, alcoholic, brutal, and ignorant, just like the poorest people everywhere; however, they are also practical in their own affairs. They are not bored, they have the power to grasp "life" tightly, and there is not a trace of the disheartening boredom that gentleman writers take from their boring experiences and write into everything.</p>
<p>In short, because they have revolution in their midst, Gorky's book is a book of dawn, not a book of doomsday. I have only appreciated Gorky's works from translations, and I have only known Gorky himself from two short but very cordial meetings. I think that's all I can say about him.</p>
<p>Romain Rolland</p>
<p>I send my heartfelt congratulations to Maxim Gorky. I wish him many more years of actively guiding the proletarian thought of the Soviet Union and the world.</p>
<p>John Galsworthy</p>
<p>I am very happy to have the opportunity to express my admiration for the great writer Maxim Gorky. I can't help but be happy to think that there is such a name among human beings, and that his complete works have also been published in several countries.</p>
<p>Upton Sinclair</p>
<p>Build a country like this, a country where all the workers are like Gorky - congratulations to him, congratulations to your country.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Is that someone calling from outside?"</p>
<p>"No. The young mistress made it herself. She said you like to eat this noodle the most."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Haiquan felt even more sorry for her. Because he was really too childish towards her this morning.</p>
<p>"What kind of person is that Japanese guy, do you know?"</p>
<p>He couldn't help but ask the nanny at this moment.</p>
<p>"Who knows. That Japanese guy drinks really heavily. Authentic Japanese sake, two or three liters every day!"</p>
<p>"What exactly does that Japanese guy do?"</p>
<p>"He just drinks every day, and after drinking, he dozes off. Sometimes he's not polite at all, and he leans against the young mistress's bed and falls asleep."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Haiquan felt another burst of almost jealous anger.</p>
<p>"······"</p>
<p>But he endured it, and it was inconvenient for him to say anything.</p>
<p>"I heard that he sent that little Japanese girl to Shanghai to find a job······"</p>
<p>"If there's no job in Japan, they all rush to Shanghai?"</p>
<p>Haiquan smiled and finished the large bowl of noodles.</p>
<p>(Eleven)</p>
<p>After Madam Tsuruko left, the Zeng mansion felt like an ice cellar to Haiquan. Haiquan couldn't sit still anymore, so he walked out alone, thinking of going to the French Park for a walk. He prepared to take a bus.</p>
<p>Standing on the side of the lower bridge, waiting for more than a quarter of an hour, he still didn't see a bus coming. He thought again, let's not go, let's go home and close the door to sleep, and go to North Sichuan Road to meet Ms. Zhuo after seven o'clock. He was pondering when someone came from behind and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Old Lin!"</p>
<p>Haiquan turned his head to look, and it turned out to be Cao Shiguang, a fellow villager studying in the Education Department of C University.</p>
<p>"Ah! Where are you going?"</p>
<p>Haiquan shook hands with Cao Shiguang and asked him.</p>
<p>"Going to the Anglican Church."</p>
<p>"It's not Sunday today, and it's afternoon, what are you doing at the church?"</p>
<p>Although Haiquan knew that Cao Shiguang had some relationship with the Anglican Church, he didn't understand his reason for going to the church at this moment.</p>
<p>"Old brother, to tell you the truth... I wouldn't tell anyone else. ...Isn't it for the sake of eating? I became the secretary of the Anglican Church's foreign pastor. Every day, no matter morning or afternoon, I have to go to the church to check the Chinese letters sent from various places for that old foreigner, and write replies for him if they need to be answered. ...A tough job, a tough job!"</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang said, and smiled bitterly for a while.</p>
<p>"Isn't that good? You have extra income."</p>
<p>"It's just this amount."</p>

<h3 id="e251">Business is Booming <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Once the season arrives, the winter sale is lively again for a long time. The banners of "Big Clearance Sale" and "Buy One Get One Free" are flying cheerfully in the center of the road. Fashionable men and women, with spring breeze on their faces, carry out packages one by one from the department stores, get into cars, and drive away. Everything is booming, everything is a peaceful scene. Moreover, what groups and what groups have now disappeared, which shows that what is being sold is all genuine old-fashioned domestic products, which can further prove that the patriotism of the big bosses is indeed not lagging behind others. Therefore, China is truly promising.</p>
<p>However, there is also such news in the newspaper. In order to believe that I am not dizzy, I respectfully and carefully transcribe it as follows:</p>
<p>"Since October, the import of Japanese goods has been the most crowded. Recently, it was heard that China and Russia have resumed diplomatic relations, and Russian goods will be sold well in China. In recent days, they have been rushing to ship to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Asamaru ship imported more than 18,600 pieces of inferior goods, mainly including textiles, machinery, yarn factory supplies, porcelain, and sugar, which increased the deadweight by one-third compared to when it arrived. On the 19th, 20th, 24th, 27th, and 30th of this month, there are still five large batches of inferior goods, about 60,000 to 70,000 pieces, on the Mikasumaru, Tsukubamaru, Rokkomaru, and Mayamaru, which are rushing to Shanghai by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Of course, this is very interesting news, especially when compared with the current lively market. Moreover, it can be seen that the purchasing power of the Chinese people has long been more than enough. Not only is the domestic product not enough for application, but also the inferior goods have a tendency to exceed supply. Therefore, I suspect that there is no war in Shanghai, and there is no such thing as "national crisis" in China. On the contrary, the word "national crisis" has such a good phenomenon, so the "national crisis" is the more the better, it may as well be a national crisis every year, until the whole of China is a "big sale" and a "big sacrifice."</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say: "Hum! Business is booming, China is really saved."</p>

<h3 id="e252">Electric Clock <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>To unify the time in various places, and to have many clocks show the same time, isn't this problem very difficult to solve? Although everyone is using spring clocks, its speed is often either fast or slow, so in the past, major cities in our country fired cannons at noon every day as a signal, which is called the noon cannon, so that the residents of the whole city could adjust their time accurately. However, after a while, each clock often has some differences, so to solve this problem, it is necessary to install an electric clock!</p>
<p>The structure of the electric clock. The electric clock uses the current to rotate the clock hands. Its main parts are roughly electromagnet and gears. Its structure is roughly that there are gears in the center, a hook below the gears, and an electromagnet above the gears. Near one end of the magnet is a soft iron piece, which is connected to the hook. When the electromagnet attracts the soft iron piece, the hook moves and the gear rotates with it. When the iron piece returns to its original position, the gear is hooked by the hook and does not move. The shaft of the gear is also equipped with several gears and other gears, rubbing against each other. The rotation speed of the initial gear and the rotation speed of the final gear are consistent with the rotation speed of the second hand, minute hand, and hour hand of the clock. Therefore, its speed has no differences and delays. Every thirty seconds, the electromagnet can be energized once, then each gear should rotate accordingly. The hour hand, minute hand, and second hand are installed on the axis of each gear, so it can indicate the time like a spring clock. This is the general situation of constructing an electric clock.</p>
<p>The use of electric clocks. Because the time of electric clocks is consistent, it can enable us to abide by the time and not break appointments with friends. Therefore, electric clocks should be installed in schools, parks, palaces, hospitals, factories, major stores, major hotels, and other public places, and at intersections, so that the residents of the whole city can always know the unified and accurate time.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Mother <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>

<p>"Dad! Where's Mom?" Six-year-old Min has been asking her father this way for the past few days. But her father's answer is always just one sentence, "She's gone out."</p>
<p>Mother sometimes goes out, but at most she comes back in two or three days. Why hasn't Mom come back after so many days? This question cannot be resolved in Min's little mind.</p>
<p>Although Min is only a six-year-old girl, she is very well-behaved. She feels that her mother hasn't come home for several days, there must be a reason. Because she saw a tragic scene of tears when her mother didn't leave, although a six-year-old child can't understand it, Min also feels that this is not happy.</p>
<p>"Mom is gone, yes, she's gone. But why hasn't she come back for so long?" Min often opens her big eyes and asks her dad, but her dad's answer is always "She's gone out."</p>
<p>One evening, she saw Dad taking many things to someone to take away. How come the clothes in the box were also taken away?</p>
<p>"Dad! Who are these things for?" Min asked curiously.</p>
<p>"For Mom!" her dad replied. There was also an unhappy look on Dad's face.</p>
<p>"Ah! For Mom! Why do you want to give it to Mom? When will Mom come back?" Min asked her dad again.</p>
<p>"I divorced your mother!" The father unintentionally spit out this sentence.</p>
<p>Min really doesn't understand the word divorce. She asked her father again, "What? When will Mom come back?"</p>
<p>"Mom won't come back!" her father replied.</p>
<p>Ah! Mom won't come back! Why? Min already knew that this time Mom's departure was a bit special. But she still doesn't quite understand that Mom won't come back. At the same time, in her little brain, she remembered a tragic scene when Mom didn't leave, Mom talked to Dad, Dad was very angry, and eventually beat Mom, Mom shed tears, and she also cried, but she cried and cried, was hugged away by the nanny to sleep, and tomorrow she didn't see Mom.</p>
<p>"Mom won't come back! Ah! I want Mom! I want Mom!" Min shouted.</p>
<p>"Child! What are you shouting! What does it matter if Mom doesn't come back?" her father scolded her.</p>
<p>"No! I must have Mom! I must go find Mom!" Min still shouted. And she cried again.</p>

<p>When a man stalks a young woman, he definitely ignores his own family and doesn't pay attention to his own shortcomings.</p>
<p>If the internal affairs of an agency are as clean and beautiful as the appearance, then corrupt officials and bureaucrats should disappear at the mere mention of them.</p>
<p>If the government implements every resolution and proposal made at meetings, then Chinese politics would have been clarified long ago, and internal wars and foreign insults would not have occurred again.</p>
<p>There may be people with genuine integrity and self-respect in the ranks of prostitutes, but it is the environment that makes them degenerate, and society that makes them fall.</p>
<p>If the advertised sacrifices and discounts of stores are all true, then the boss of the store will at least have to sell his fields and land, and if things don't go well, he will have to put his concubine up for auction.</p>
<p>If the Chinese people had the kind of indomitable spirit of telegram declarations on the anti-Japanese front, the Japanese would at least retreat three houses.</p>
<p>The organizations that sing the tune of maintaining peace are the organizations that help the scourge of war. Just look at the international situation today, and you can understand everything.</p>
<p>Once the children of wealthy families go bankrupt, there is only one way to die, because they are usually pampered and cannot bear the slightest pain.</p>
<p>Lazy clerks are bound to be jealous of diligent clerks, because they are afraid that their own shortcomings will be discovered by the manager.</p>
<p>If the courage of two brothers fighting for inheritance is used on the anti-Japanese front, then the Japanese will at least retreat three houses.</p>

<p>I have something I cannot understand myself; moreover, I have been greatly stimulated by this matter, and many thoughts have arisen. Now, I will write down the process of this matter below, earnestly asking for your guidance and instruction. The matter is as follows: A certain teacher from ×× University sent his servant to our shop yesterday afternoon to buy a bottle of laxative pills. In the evening, the servant came and said: "After opening the bottle, it was already broken! The pills have changed color, please exchange it for a new bottle." Whether it is the original item, I cannot confirm; I think a respectable teacher would not switch the contents. Because the manager was not present, there was no one to take responsibility, and I am just a powerless employee, how could I agree! The servant who came to speak was quite unreasonable, so I had no choice but to go with him to Mr. So-and-so's apartment. My original intention was to plead earnestly and wait for the manager to return before discussing it. Who knew that after I explained my purpose, (I can frankly say that I had no offensive words at the time). Mr. So-and-so did not show any reaction, but another teacher in the room, seeing that I was small and could be bullied, said very briskly, as if angry but not really angry: "If you don't exchange it, I will hit you, do you believe it!" Before he finished speaking, he raised his fist and sent it towards my face. Fortunately, I dodged quickly and was not injured. Surrounded by oppressive forces, embracing the principle of "a wise man does not fight when the odds are against him," I had no choice but to retreat.</p>
<p>Now, what I do not understand is:</p>
<p>㈠ Can an educated university teacher act so barbarically? Does this matter harm the reputation of the education community?</p>
<p>㈡ How can I avenge my shame regarding this matter? (If I file a lawsuit, I was alone at the scene, with no one to testify, and no injuries, so I will inevitably lose.)</p>
<p>㈢ If I appeal to the school authorities, will I receive a satisfactory response?</p>
<p>㈣ Why are teachers humble towards students but tyrannical towards others? What is their psychology?</p>
<p>㈤ How should I prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future?</p>
<p>Regarding the above five points: I beg you not to give a simple answer like "Great shame | National shame | is already like this, small shame should be endured even more." Thank you! Thank you!</p>
<p>Yu Rui from ×× Shop, opposite ×× University</p>
<p>One. Can an educated university teacher act so barbarically? This is certainly not something that should happen. However, we should also know that so-called black sheep exist everywhere. Among university teachers, there are indeed many who are well-studied and deeply knowledgeable. However, there are also many who, relying on advantageous opportunities, received higher education, even studying in the West, and then became university teachers after returning to the country, but whose actual knowledge is not particularly outstanding. We should not involve others just because one or two individuals behave barbarically. As for the question of whether this kind of behavior harms the reputation of the education community, we believe that the lack of unity and discipline in China's education community today is a phenomenon similar to various problems in the entire country. Everyone is too busy taking care of themselves, so what reputation is there to speak of? Such a "barbaric" act towards you can be considered a very minor matter among the things that harm the reputation of the education community.</p>
<p>Two. Speaking of resorting to legal measures, the editor feels that, as you said in your letter, "Since there is no witness and no injury," it is unnecessary to take such action. If you consider this matter a shame, I think that if you can use this stimulus to diligently engage in moral cultivation, academic research, and conscientious work to promote your career to an early success; when you succeed, this small shame will be completely avenged. You probably don't agree with this answer; but there are two points I want you to pay attention to: (A) A true man should take the responsibility of avenging national grievances as his own, what is a small personal grievance? (B) One of the biggest flaws of the Chinese nation is the excessive separation between individuals and the extremely weak will to fight for public causes. We hope that you will think in the long term and on a larger scale, and take on the responsibility of correcting this trend.</p>
<p>Three. If you talk about appealing to the school authorities, most of the current university authorities are important people and celebrities. They are so busy that they don't even have time to approve official documents, so where would they have the energy to deal with these irrelevant trivial matters? I hope you will not appeal this matter to the school authorities, because appealing to the authorities will not only fail to get a satisfactory response, but may also suffer greater humiliation.</p>
<p>Four. Regarding the teacher's attitude towards students and others, it is generally based on economics, to put it bluntly: it is a matter of livelihood. Because there are students, there is a livelihood; if you are not humble, your livelihood may be in danger. As for "why be tyrannical towards others?" It is just that those below their eye level are prone to encounter this misfortune. Towards those above them, they are too busy flattering! How dare they be tyrannical? This reason is very obvious: for there has never been a person who is arrogant to their inferiors and does not flatter their superiors. If we go a little deeper, although knowledge and morality are closely related, they are ultimately two different things. A person with high morals may not necessarily have profound knowledge; similarly, a scholar's morality may not necessarily surpass everything. (This point is related to Mr. Yu's first question.) We should not assume that university teachers have high morals just because they are intellectuals. Our view of morality should not be determined by form. For example: when we meet kind and hardworking old farmers in the fields, we will naturally feel an unspeakable respect at once; while in the city, we feel that the gorgeously dressed and extravagant merchants are despicable. These two diametrically opposed psychologies are entirely produced by the social environment and the power of morality; therefore, the level of morality is not determined by the level of knowledge. Like Mr. Yu, although in terms of knowledge, you may not be as good as the so-called university teachers, but you still know that hitting someone is impolite, so we undoubtedly acknowledge that your morality is above that of the university teacher.</p>
<p>Five. It is difficult to define a preventive measure for this type of matter. In the future, when dealing with the world, it is best to use the nature of the matter as the standard and deal with the situation at any time and in any place, and of course there will be no difficulty. For example: we believe that your response to the matter you encountered this time was very appropriate. Because the manager was not in the store, you naturally could not exchange a bottle for him at that time. This is very correct in terms of duty. And you immediately went to Mr. So-and-so's apartment with the servant to explain the situation, which can also be regarded as a appropriate way. As for the danger of your face being punched by another teacher, your retreat at the time, although it was surrender, in reality, your personality was unharmed, and the other party's morality was greatly damaged. If you report the situation to the manager after the incident, the manager should be responsible for the negotiation; if he does not negotiate, that is his responsibility. But you stand in a correct position. In short, we should give considerable tolerance to this kind of unreasonable tyranny within the scope of not losing our responsibility and not losing our personality. This is called: "Bearing humiliation and bearing heavy responsibilities," this is called: "A scholar can be humiliated, but cannot be subdued." We hope that Mr. Yu will understand and comprehend from this point of meaning.</p>
<p>Editor's note: This letter could have been kept private, but we believe that there are many shop assistants who are younger, have limited knowledge, and most of them are away from their families and lack close guardians to guide them. They often regard very small stimuli as strange shame and great humiliation, leading to unfortunate incidents. As yesterday's news on the third page of this newspaper reported: Wu Panzhang, an apprentice from Anhui Province at the Universal Hat Factory on Yokohama Road, Zhabei, who is seventeen years old, committed suicide by smoking opium after arguing with a colleague. This is an example right before our eyes. This situation is not a blessing to society and makes us feel very uneasy. Therefore, we have answered Mr. Yu's letter point by point, hoping that dear apprentices, whenever you encounter unreasonable tyranny, do not be overly impulsive and do many unexpected things. This is one of the purposes of this open letter.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"That's right! You were a famous clever devil in those days! You guessed this matter of mine!" She was simply as clever as I am. "However, I didn't plan to hide it from you; and I very much intend to discuss it with you. Because you know: he completely deceived me, and I am now determined to negotiate with him!"</p>
<p>Her later reversal greatly exceeded what I could have imagined.</p>
<p>"For this kind of dispute between men and women, you must hire a lawyer to negotiate. ... But, aren't you also a full-fledged Bachelor of Laws?" To be honest: I myself can't think of a satisfactory solution to my dispute with you, so I took the last resort of fleeing. How can I plan for her! Therefore, I replied with humorous and irrelevant words.</p>
<p>"I'm talking to you seriously, don't mess around! Hiring a lawyer is very much in line with my own plan! Isn't Zhou Dajing a lawyer in Shanghai?" I really admire the forgetfulness of our Empress Dowager. She said the name of her old lover, Zhou Dajing, who used to be with her all day long, and spent money on her like a young master, as if he was an ordinary old classmate, without any hesitation.</p>
<p>"That's right! He has quite a reputation in Shanghai. You are old classmates. If you go to him, he will definitely not rip you off!"</p>
<p>She picked up the glass and took a sip of tea, smiling leisurely.</p>
<p>"You, ... have you seen him recently?" I planned to use a step-by-step offensive strategy to bring up the old stories between her and Dajing, and scold her thoroughly.</p>
<p>"No." She was still smiling, as calm as if she had never said half a word to Zhou Dajing before.</p>
<p>"He still misses you very much! He misses you very badly!" I took another step forward.</p>
<p>"Didn't he get married a long time ago!" She began to resist.</p>
<p>"But, he doesn't love his wife; he still loves you!" I boldly threw a hand grenade.</p>
<p>"Haha! ... Haha! ... Haha! ..." The result of throwing this hand grenade was that she couldn't help but put down the teacup, looked at me with a contemptuous look, and laughed wildly.</p>
<p>"Haha! ... Haha! ..." One minute, two minutes, ... she continued to laugh. She laughed so hard that her whole body was shaking. I still haven't understood why she was laughing, and I was always stunned. Several gentlemen on the side who were trying to doze off were also awakened by her crazy laughter, and looked at me and her with surprised and questioning eyes.</p>
<p>"Haha! ... Haha! ..." She was laughing without regard for her life, and I was laughed at so much that I didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>"Hey! Hey! Miss Li! Can you stop laughing for a while?" I had to retreat from the offensive position to the position of surrendering.</p>
<p>"Haha! ... Haha! ..." It was hard to end her laughter. She laughed so hard that tears came out.</p>
<p>"What was so funny about those two sentences just now that you laughed so hard?" I quickly asked her the reason for laughing.</p>
<p>"Haha! ... Haha! ..." She almost laughed again. But, she tried her best to hold back her laughter and said two shocking words very frankly, "Dajing doesn't love his wife, but you love his wife."</p>

<p>Rare News in the Film World</p>
<h3 id="e257">Is Suzanne Bianchetti a Comedian? (Part 2) <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Furen</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, the West Cecil B. DeMille or Lubitsch was an Eric von Stroheim of German origin. One day, Stroheim was alone in his office and slammed the table, flying into a rage. He said, "Why can't I find a suitable woman for my film? I don't have a single good person under me, they are all useless!"</p>
<p>Stroheim looked up and saw a thin and weak woman standing in front of him.</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"My name is Suzanne Bianchetti."</p>
<p>"What a joke! What kind of name is that? Why would a good person have such a terrible name?"</p>
<p>"You're right, sir. These are the names of my two aunts, and my name is in memory of them."</p>
<p>Stroheim smiled and said quickly, "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, we can try it first."</p>
<p>The film that Suzanne Bianchetti was acting in at that time was called "Greed". Bianchetti played a greedy and ruthless woman. Stroheim went all out and shot more than a hundred reels (over ten million feet). Later, he cut it into an eight-hour film. This film probably hasn't been released publicly. It was indeed a failure, but it was an economic failure, not a technical failure. Now all the big films that pass through are the incarnation of "Greed" and cannot break away from the artistic mold of Stroheim.</p>
<p>At that time, only six people had seen the test screening of "Greed". They are now scattered in all directions and can still remember the greatness of this film. They all expressed infinite respect when they mentioned Suzanne Bianchetti. Stroheim repeatedly exclaimed during the test screening, "Suzanne Bianchetti is the greatest tragedian of her generation!"</p>
<p>But the roles of tragedians are very few, and even the greatest tragedian of her generation has to eat. Her eyes are very interesting, and the movements of her hands can make people laugh, so after many trials and tribulations, she had to change her career. Playing only tragic roles would lead to starvation.</p>
<p>It is true that "environment changes temperament, nurture changes the body." Suzanne Bianchetti changed into comedic roles, and her stiff demeanor gradually faded. Her views on everything in the world have also changed. She is now one of the most outspoken women in the world. Not only can she make people laugh, but she often makes fun of herself to find happiness.</p>
<p>Recently, she had a story. When filming "All Quiet on the Western Front," director Carl Laemmle remembered Suzanne Bianchetti's appearance in the film "Greed," so he invited Bianchetti to play the role of the poor German woman. When the film was finished and ready for the test screening, everyone laughed when they saw Suzanne Bianchetti. This was not a funny film, but as soon as Suzanne Bianchetti's face appeared, the audience would laugh without waiting to see her performance. Therefore, that part of "All Quiet on the Western Front" was later reshot with a different person.</p>
<p>Suzanne Bianchetti's tragic era has passed, flowing eastward like water and cannot return. Stroheim, old and with failing eyesight, watched her perform one comedy after another, making people laugh. He still clenched his fists, bitterly cursing the reversal of the world and the demise of genius. (End)</p>
<p>Charles Farrell once won first place in the All-American Beautiful Man election in 1927. His golden age has not completely passed even now. Although he ranked fourth this year, he has consistently been number one among male stars for five years. "Seventh Heaven" was the beginning of his good luck in his life and the goal that people will never forget and admire. In the sound world, his masterpieces include "Four Devils," "Tear Stains," "Butterfly Drunk with Flowers," and the recent "First Year of Marriage." Of course, Janet Gaynor is his old partner.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Two Inventors of Sound Film Machines <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>China's first sound film was "After the Rain Clears", which was produced in Japan. After the September 18th Incident, Huaguang Company could no longer stay in the eastern neighbor, and its own capital was insufficient, so it announced its closure.</p>
<p>Then came the mighty Tianyi, which was originally a small company. Unexpectedly, after the studio caught fire, the Shaw brothers made a big decision, hired seven technicians, and bought a complete set of "Western Electric" machinery. They successfully produced ten sound films in a year. Recently, it is said that they have abandoned foreign employees such as "Xu Guo" altogether, but the machine is foreign-made and still cannot be considered purely domestic.</p>
<p>The Startone of the Mingxing Company first used wax discs to record "Singer Red Peony," which was quite successful, so they also bought a set of American radios, but how can that be considered domestic?</p>
<p>The only Chinese sound films we have seen are these. Originally, we didn't even have silent film cameras or film in our country, so why should we demand sound film cameras? However, facts are beyond people's expectations. Some people have invented domestic sound film cameras.</p>
<p>The first person to research this sound machine was Yan Heming. He spent five years of hard work and actually succeeded. Of course, it is not a 100% invention. Most of it can be considered imitation, but to take a step back, being able to imitate successfully, or even surpass the original, is already a supreme glory for China, a country with backward industry. He named it "Yan Su Tong". The first film was produced by Hengsheng Company, "Spring Tide" started filming for half a year and is about to be published. The results of the filming are said to have the momentum to surpass imported films.</p>
<p>The second is Mr. Zhu Qingxian. He and Mr. Yan can be considered the great heroes of the Chinese film industry. The machine he made is called "Qingxian-style Sound Film Machine."</p>
<p>When Wang Fuqing heard that he had succeeded, he ran to sign a contract to shoot a "Spring Breeze and Willow" film. Later, Mr. Zhu also made a "Winning Glory for the Country" for Fudan Company. These few days, the location shots have been completed in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Don't ask how the performances are, how the sound is, for the above three films, because they are purely Chinese-made sound films. However, it is expected that they will not be bad. In any case, the two Yans and Zhus have indeed contributed to the Chinese film industry.</p>

<h3 id="e259">The Face on the Screen (Middle) <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Dun Ruo</p>
<p>"I guess your life isn't very comfortable, is it?" Philip asked her. At first, she didn't answer, but later she said:</p>
<p>"If my husband didn't have a mental illness, everything would be fine. When he has an episode, even four men can't hold him down on the bed. Usually, he just sleeps in a daze. When he was hired by Boss and Chebes, a piece of iron fell on his head. Of course, the doctor said that the illness wasn't caused by the piece of iron, but because he drank too much alcohol. Maybe the doctor is right. Not long ago, I fell on the street. The doctor said I was malnourished. Alas, after taking the seventy fenni advance, I still have to pay rent and gas. What else can I use?" She said in a hoarse and monotonous voice.</p>
<p>"Well, then go see Mr. Chepeki. He may be able to help with your life," Philip encouraged her. So he unconsciously got off the train without knowing which station he had stopped at. Triga Arski shook his head gently after he left.</p>
<p>The following is the beginning of her amazing film career.</p>
<p>She walked into the elegantly decorated Harvard office to see Leonard Chepeki. Chepeki looked at her with great hope. She stood in the middle of the room, not understanding what was going on, but she wasn't panicked. She felt indifferent to everything. From then on, she worked here, and she could earn ten marks a day. She couldn't believe her luck.</p>
<p>There were already many women here who were dressed as raggedly as she was. Their faces were also painted with wrinkles and shadows like hers. She was pushed back and forth by them, but she never felt that she was also a part of this crowd. In this crowd of painted masks, her truth was terribly real. A kind of indifferent expression flowed out naturally from her heart. Her eyes were strongly stimulated by the arc lights, and tears kept flowing down. At one o'clock, all the actors went to the dining hall to eat, but she didn't go with them. She sat in a hidden corner of the studio and took out a piece of bread from her oilcloth bag and ate it. Chepeki almost bumped into her.</p>
<p>Work started again at half past eight in the evening. Philip stood on a large ladder in front of her. Behind them, many people used megaphones to order them to move forward. They had instructed Triga Arski that if she heard the slogan "Go now," she had to leave the crowd and go to the stairs. She walked very naturally. She left the crowd and shielded her eyes from the bright lights. Her tears were flowing so badly that she couldn't see anything. The photographer on the wooden frame excitedly turned his crank like crazy.</p>
<p>"Unbelievable, unbelievable," someone whispered. "Come again tomorrow. We want to shoot a solo performance," Chepeki said to her later. She filmed for three consecutive days and earned thirty marks.</p>
<p>Random Talk</p>
<h3 id="e260">Discussion on Film Title Translations <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Jianan</p>
<p>The name of a film encompasses the essence of the entire script. Before seeing the entire film, the audience has a considerable concept of the content after reading the title. Therefore, it will determine whether to watch it or not. Therefore, the title is directly related to the box office appeal. In today's cinemas, regardless of the content of imported films, they are always translated into names that are sensual, erotic, and cater to the general social psychology. As a result, audiences often feel disappointed and curse. But sometimes there are very good films that suffer a tragic fate of a deserted theater because the translation is bland. Indeed, for the endless stream of films produced, it is really difficult to use titles that are not repeated and must be novel and unique. However, for business reasons, cinemas must pay attention to the following principles when translating titles:</p>
<p>(1) Faithful It is necessary to use novel names for advertising, but the translation must be fully consistent with the story. The truth cannot escape the audience's eyes, and deception can only happen once. There will eventually be a day of failure if you desperately use ×× Erotic History and ×× Spectacle to attract audiences.</p>
<p>(2) Popular and Elegant A name with poetic meaning is certainly very elegant, but for the general audience who don't understand it well, a profound classic is too uncommon.</p>
<p>(3) Avoid Direct Translation When Possible Because of the differences in customs and human feelings between the East and the West, it is not necessarily suitable to translate their commonly used words into the national language. As for uncommon specialized terms, using transliteration is even more undesirable.</p>
<p>(4) The Translations Must Be Consistent This is a specific instruction for theaters that show second-run films. Using different translations for films that have already been shown, and not posting the original name, often makes audiences unwilling to watch again.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Gong Qiuxia's "Little Lover" <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Xingxiu</p>
<p>Recently, many female stars have entered the film industry from the song and dance world, such as Wang Renmei and Li Lili, who have already enjoyed considerable fame. The film industry's attention to talents in the song and dance world was caused by these two. Gong Qiuxia of the Meihua Song and Dance Troupe also has news of entering the film industry, but because the conditions cannot be agreed upon, she cannot fulfill her wish early. In the previous issues of this journal, Qingxia and Yinguang both made mistakes in their short history of her. Before joining the Meihua Song and Dance Troupe, she did join the Putao Song and Dance Troupe. Wu Peixian was also a member of Putao, and they met at this time. She and Wu Peixian co-starred in "Little Lover," with Wu playing the male role. Both of their performances were innocent and lovely, and they are still praised today. Unfortunately, Wu died early. Wu was indeed a woman. The mistake of thinking she was a man may be because she played a male role in "Little Lover."</p>
<p>Film Treatise</p>
<h3 id="e262">From Tears to Laughter <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Now, please try the eighth expression self-study method in front of the mirror again.</p>
<p>Your breathing can help you wrinkle your brows and the corners of your eyes to resemble a crying face, and tears will naturally flow out. Take a closer look, are there any parts of your face that resemble a smile? Of course, there won't be. The corners of the lips turn upward when smiling, and downward when crying. This is obvious, isn't it? But that's not enough. With a slight carelessness, your lips might open slightly, and when captured by the camera, the result still resembles a smile. Many famous stars have clearly cried real tears, but the result is similar to a smile, simply because their lips were not tightly closed.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am specifically calling your attention here. When you go to the studio for practical training in the future, when you are performing a crying scene, do not neglect your lips.</p>
<p>The ninth expression self-study method is going from tears to laughter.</p>
<p>Continue to use the method of slowly inhaling and exhaling through the nostrils while silently counting "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight" to gradually make a crying face. Maintain this crying face, while silently counting "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight" in your mind. While slowly exhaling, the muscles of your face gradually relax, transforming from a slight smile into hearty laughter. At the same time, you should carefully observe in the mirror what kind of changes have occurred in the muscles around your eyes and the muscles above and below your lips.</p>
