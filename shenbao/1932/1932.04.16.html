<p>時評</p>
<h3>歐迎羅格博士彬</h3>
<p>美國著名教育家羅帮博士Ｄf·Ｈ·Ｒugg於日前抵滬。羅氏原本爲學工程學。繼乃研究教育。現專門於（課程改造）之研究。在美國教育界中爲最進步之人物。對於美國現在之資本主義教育制度。頗致不滿。此來我國。一爲考察東西文化接觸後所發生之影響。一爲考察正處於於動盪與轉變之程途中之中國之文化界一般的現象。吾人對於此爲人類文化而遠道僕僕之來賓謹特表示歡迎之忱。同時更不能無一言。</p>
<p>美國爲近世資本主義發達達於頂點之國家。其國内教育之發達。學校規模與設備之宏偉。自爲世界任何國家所不能望其項背。故美國之教育。殆即可謂爲資本主義教育之最高典型。然而最優良之教育之模型。固不僅偏於物質方面之宏偉設備。其尤重要者。爲另一種活潑的健全的自由的前進的（生命力）而資本主義制度下之教育。對於此種必不可少之（生命力）。則顯然爲十分貧乏。即舉美國爲例。美國今日之教育。顯然爲商業化。教育之重心。完全爲資本階級所操持。狂熱之（競賽）（功利主義）之支配整個教育。教授與學生之關係。完全成爲智識之販賣。以及學校行政之完全爲幾於僅具商業頭腦之實利主義者所支配。都足以證明美國之教育。爲完全爲資本主義作工具。造奴𨽻。而爲社會造自由人。抑且迄至目前仍毫不覺悟。此爲資本主義教育最大而又無法避免之缺憾。以故吾人認爲此種教育。實有根本予以摧毀之必要。</p>
<p>中國爲生産落後。受宰制於帝國主義與封建勢力兩重恶勢力定之國家。今日正處於破落之程途中。正處於極其艱困之境地。由於經濟之落後與政治之不上軌道。其在文化上與教育上之爲凋敝。爲破落爲衰老。自爲無可諱言。羅氏亦自可由正確之觀察。認取正確之事實。然而吾人所必須特爲指陳者。即在今日（黑暗中國）之另一面。尚有多數之（光明追求者）。正在爲創造新的文化新的教育而努力而奮鬥。此種艱苦之奮鬥。吾人并敢必其能得成功。（少年之中國）必可由此種奮鬥而呈獻於世人之眼前。</p>
<p>抑吾人之所以認爲羅氏此來我國。較之杜威克卜屈諸氏之來。尤有特殊怠義者。即羅氏始本爲工程學者。繼乃研究教育。工程師之於建築。其所持之原則。爲破壞陳舊不堪者。保存舊有之優良者。作成嶄新之創造。教育之原則。則亦不離乎是。故羅氏以工程學之學識與經騐。致力於教育之研究。自能獲得偉大之成就。不過吾人認爲工程師有（新）（舊）之分。教育家亦有新舊之别。（舊）工程師徒爲帝造王宫殿。爲特殊階級造亭台樓榭。（新）工程師則爲多數人造房屋。造公共之圖書館公園以及種種適合於大多數人要求之建築物舊教育家徒爲帝王造順民。爲統治者造奴隸。爲舊時代造承繼者。新教育家則爲社會造健全之自由人。爲新時代造具有創造能力之（工人）。羅氏以工程學者兼教育學者。而其思想則又不囿於當前資本主義世界之華貴奥都麗屬。吾人敢斷言其對於教育前途。必能有偉大之貢獻。</p>
<p>羅氏此來我國。吾人已知其一爲考察。一爲搜羅事實。藉以作成（新教育）之圖樣。然而吾人敢爲羅氏言者。即中國今日亦正有多數（新教育家）努力於（新教育）圖樣之研究。作成吾人深盼東方與西方之新教育家携手。共同努力。争取推進時代之巨輪之偉大成功。</p>

<p>中國代表團提送備忘錄</p>
<p>滬案休戰談判移交辦理</p>
<p>日方態度强硬拒絶參加</p>
<p>路透社十五日日内瓦電云、比外相希孟今日與日代表佐藤長岡·中代表顔惠慶·及國聯秘書長德魯蒙、會商明日十九國特委會開會討論中日争案事、日方對於上海休戰談判所表示之態度、殊爲强硬、故一般人士對於明日會議之結果、頗多猜測、衆視事態頗形複雜、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十五日日内瓦電云、中國代表頃以備忘錄送達國聯秘書長、緣十九委員會將於明日開會、中國備忘錄、特將中國爲執行國聯行政院决議案而採取或將採取之各種方法、予以陳述、以備十九委員會之參考、該備忘錄聲明、中國所採之方法、因日本政府之態度、致全歸無效、現在東三省不合常軌之狀態、實由日本不遵照行政院决議案而生、故應由日本負其責任、中國備忘錄又由各種事變之經過、得到下列之論斷、即中日兩國妥協之主要障礙、在於﨎方對鐵路附屬地在以外中國領土地内、（日本人生命財産之安全、如何有效保障）一層、解釋各不相同、依中國政府解釋、所謂安全條件、乃在對日本僑民、確保其生命財産、於日軍撤退以後、不致受報復之害、此種解釋、在十月二十三日及二十四日開會時、曾經行政院會員數人、明白贊同、而當時行政院主席白里安氏、亦即如此主張、此種條件、包含警察問題、屬於行政範圍、亦可包含軍事問題、均易迅速解决者、此中國政府之意見、亦即所謂生命財産安全原則之自然解釋、不幸日本政府、始終將此事視作一種保護計畫、使滿洲成爲政治有經濟上之保護地、而欲於直接談判之時、恃日本軍隊占據之壓迫、强中國政府承認之也、</p>
<p>路透社十五日日内瓦電云、聞國聯大會所組織辦理中日問題十九委員中之日人委員、對於上海休戰會議未成之原因、將提出下述之説明、據謂中國學生恫嚇中國總代表、聲稱如簽訂辱國之休戰條約、則定撲殺之、故總代表託詞有病、避於法租界之某醫院云、此間日方稱、關於顧維約博士往游東三省之困難、依然存在、十九委員會定明日集議、</p>
<p>路透社十五日東京電云、路透社今日從可恃方面探悉、日政府將訓令日内瓦日代表、如十九委員會接受中政府之請求、辦理上海休戰條約之問題、則日代表須拒絶加入、據日方意見、中國此項請求、僅爲中國可避免在滬成立協定之策略、聞日本漢備如屬需要、可向國聯説明上海談判之經過情形、但堅執不允將休戰談判、移交日内瓦辦理、</p>
<p>電通社十五日東京電云、芳澤外相經政府首腦部恊議之結果、對日内瓦日本代表團發出下述之訓電、明日十六日所開之十九國委員會、未經日本承諾、因根據三月十一日之决議所開、故日本難加承認、日本代表實無出席之必要、若該委員會要求説明關於上海停戰會議之事情、則命澤田聯盟事務長説明之、日本因不承認該委員會、故其决議、亦不加承認云云、</p>

<p>蘇州十五日專電云、近來前綫沉静無戰、但日機殊活動、日來偵察我陣地及後方、十五晨八時許、蘇地到一日機、繞城一　而去、至下午三時許又來一架偵察、飛甚低、聲聞全城、蘇英美僑認日此種生動爲挑釁、議電美英使向日勸阻、崑山上午十一時半、到一日機、偵察甚久始去、瀏河汽車站十五敵停有汽車五十餘輛、用意不明、陸渡橋原有日軍五六日、現剩三四面、瀏河有敵千餘、新塘市有百餘、常熟江中、時有敵艦上下行動、安亭平静、</p>
<h3>美全部艦隊擬長駐太平洋</h3>
<p>國民社十四日華盛頓電云、今日美海軍部中人聲稱、該部刻正考慮將美國全部艦隊、無定期留駐太平洋上、惟命令尚未發出、目下該部主腦人物、正在會商頒發此次命令、蓋鑒於遠東緊急形勢、顯然有繼續存在之性質故也、此外又聞美國務院已提議將數星期前開往檀香山及西方海濱會操之巡弋艦隊、長留太平洋、（不必開回大西洋、但詢諸海軍部中人、則不願加以徵實、惟觀察情形、國務院此次意見、顯然爲造成海軍部重行分配艦隊計劃之一份子云、</p>
<p>大美晚報云、據華盛頓電訊、美海軍部鑒於遠東嚴重局勢有延長之象、刻正考慮將全國艦隊於會操完畢後、暫留太平洋、以便緩急時易於開赴東方、此種消息在遠東觀之、誠極有注意之價值、因此目下美國亞洲艦隊之調動諒亦爲閲者所欲知、據本埠美海軍採辦處消息、美艦羅哲斯特號將於五月五日抵滬、飛機母艦郎萊號則尚無確訊、飛機母艦傑森號、刻正在開赴甘姆途中、美陸軍運艦共和號定於六月十七日抵馬尼剌、行將過滬小駐、而往秦皇島、又關於本星期内美艦之調動、則有砲艦保羅瓊士號開往揚子江、代替巴洛特號、又灰浦爾號開往南京、都土勒號及巴羅號兩砲艦現泊漢口、巴雷號方開赴揚子江中游、烏湖號駐宜昌、甘姆號駐重慶、土爾薩號方在上海騐勘艦身、薩克拉門都號則來上海、至華南方面則岷達拿號與希勒拉號兩艦在香港、史密斯湯主號泊厦門、又驅逐艦波利等三艘、正在馬尼剌演習放砲云、</p>

<h3>調查團由京西上情况（五）</h3>
<p>附錄國聯處置中日糾紛經過</p>
<p>乙·行政院第三次集會的經過</p>
<p>（一）十一月十六日會議及會議後的情形那天的公開會議、不過是一種外交形式、除由主席宣佈理由外、並未作何種辯論、所以一切交涉均用秘密會議方法進行、這種會議、差不多每日都在舉行、</p>
<p>我國當時仍持始終一貫的先撤、兵後交涉度、而日本則堅持我國承認其所謂五項基本原則、至於英法態度、則完全觀望、英法以美國爲太平洋國家、在華利益多於英法、又有極强的海軍及雄厚的經濟爲後盾、對日行動應採强硬鮮明的態度、而美國則以爲中日糾紛旣由國聯處理、故國聯應完全負解决的責任、美國祗可從旁襄助而已、英法欲美國先行表示與國聯攻守同盟的態度、而美國則欲看國聯的行動如何、再加考慮期以獨立久交與國聯作相對的合作、</p>
<p>美國代表竇父將軍到巴黎後、仍然保全其副總統的威嚴深居簡出、而主席行政院的法外長白　里安、以身爲主人、不便先行拜客、所以行政院開會數天、不得絲毫的進展而在滿洲北部則日軍已與馬占山將軍劇戰於嫩江兩岸了、</p>
<p>及齊齊哈爾陷落、消息傳來、説者都以爲日本投炸彈於行政院的議席、竇父將軍亦往訪白里安、商量對付方法、一時空氣緊張、美國國務卿向日本駐美大使作嚴格的質問同時行政院十二委員會議又討論第十五六條的應用、然而强有力者</p>
<p>中制裁侵略行動長有效力第十五六條、因此也就不能提出了、</p>
<p>瀋陽吉林及齊齊哈爾、是我國東省的三大都會、現在相繼被佔、而日本統治滿洲的好夢竟圓、日本爲和緩列强、乃變更策略、向行政院宣稱、五項基本原則可以留交後來中日政府直接交涉時討論、目下不必在行政院强求中國承認、至於派員調查、日政府現可接受、</p>
<p>（二）十一月廿一日會議後的情形　該日開會、日代表正式作派員調查的提議、請衆贊成、但謂調查範圍、不限於滿洲、而中國本部的抗日運動亦在調查之列、我國代表以日本政策的狡猾、回答説、現在最要緊之事、莫如令日軍停止軍事行動、及退回南滿線内假使放鬆這點、而做其他的事件爲交換的條件、則中國政府萬不能接納、至於派員調查、乃中國數月前的提議、自然可以贊同、但是調查團的權限、等到日代表正式提出具體辦法時、中國當作相當的考慮、不過中國只管要求定期退兵、而日本已運動得美國反對此種提議、其理由以東省遍地皆匪、實不應要求日軍馬上撤退、以危害外人的生命財産、英法亦從中附和、而我國定期撤兵的主張、乃無形中爲列强所拒絶了、會議到這時候、白里安遂請日代表提出關於組織調查團的具體辦法、爲下次會議討論的根據、并懇切的對日代表聲明説、在調查國工作期間、絶對不得再有軍事行動、白里安言時、流露無竊悲痛的情感、並説在這風雨飄搖的時節、燦爛而正大的國聯之運命、適操於本人之手、所以不敢不敬謹從事、以保其久遠、諸位代表、苟能與本人合作而解决目前困難、則本人的喜幸、奚可勝言、國際的事業愈危、旁聽批評者愈多、而至於剌諷、我們因此愈加努力、而世界各民旅對於國聯的信仰亦愈堅、如不見信、請看主席日來所接地球四方拍來、高積如山的電報、以表示其對吾人的信仰及希望、由此可以證明國聯精神力量的偉大、我們豈能任人毀滅這種力量、以毀滅人類前途的希望、而爲天下後世之罪人嗎、白里安有愛護國聯、如保赤子、而世界政治的複雜、竟令白氏對於中日糾紛、一籌莫展、是很可惜的、（未完）</p>

<p>銀根已趨鬆勢：銅元見新長價</p>
<p>前昨兩日·洋厘形勢稍有回頭、然觀昨午情形仍未能有挺進之勢、如此欲進不進之狀况、則厘市怠風、恐又未能蠲除也、早市爲七錢○三厘七毫半、午市爲二三厘六毫二忽半、結果較前日午市改好六毫二忽半、做出滙劃票欵、早市三十二萬一千、鈔票四萬、午市滙劃票欵六十八兩、鈔票二萬、銀行買進及賣出兩市八十五萬、其中以買進佔多、茶商亦有數十萬銷胃、銀拆早午市仍爲一錢五分、劃頭加水初爲二錢、收盤時祗有七八分、可見銀根已趨鬆勢矣、折票交易兩市二百十餘萬、各銀行洋户往來收解九十餘萬、銀欵收解、計華商收解各欵二百五十餘萬、關税欵收入三十餘萬、外商收解各欵三百十餘萬、滙兑收解八十餘萬、貨欵收解五十餘萬、小錢莊交易四十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收角四百十餘萬、銀公單收解二千九百餘萬補幣市况、江南小洋兩市均無交易故市價如初、均爲六錢一分、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢一分三厘、午市爲二厘六毫二怱半、做出交易、早午市十三萬角、形勢亦鬆、惟銅元以供求相差、大盤特放長四千文、爲四百十七千文、而開從未見開之新長價、交易三萬四千餘串、</p>
<h3>證劵債劵暗盤又漲半元</h3>
<p>昨日華商證劵了結交易仍有、惟僅編遣一萬元、一九善五千元、其他槪無進出、至暗盤價、以時局静定、市上人心尚佳、需要頗活動、故較諸前日、繼續趨堅、比前日復好起半元左右云、</p>
<h3>紗花紗銷起色希望少</h3>
<p>棉紗市情甚疲、跌勢未定、大有每况愈下之慨、以實銷岑淑、時局沉悶、而金融難以流通、故各路商業停滯、致人氣衰弱、市面殊難發展、而各廠有紗日見增多、市價更難立定、因此跌風更織、細紗形　尤軟、總之在此時局遠離不靖中、紗銷起色希望甚少、查全日各帮買去毁計祗三百十包、行情又跌五錢光景、客帮中内地進六十一包、四川一百零五包、汕頭六十五包、北帮二十包、厦門十包、江西五包、同行六十包云、</p>
<h3>申新掉購本棉不絶</h3>
<p>棉花市况依然穩静、因奏棉趨勢轉漲、印棉反動上漲、而金價堅挺、致人心安定、但紗市挫折、紗價逐步下降、廠商均抱觀望態度、惟申新廠將印美兩棉、結價了結不少、頭襯缺乏、故掉購本棉、因之採辦異常熱閙、每日購買不絶、其他各廠甚少舉動、茲將售盤錄左、</p>

<h3>美棉好十二磅音</h3>
<p>昨美棉初因利物浦消息良好而堅、旋因華爾街不振而疲、卒因現銷暢達再昻、計期貨漲十至十二磅音、現貨漲十五磅音、英棉期貨跌六至八點、現貨不動、埃及棉現貨不動、印棉因空户抵補及投機家買進而堅、計平果爾漲五·五羅比、白羅溪漲四·二五羅比、原電錄左、（十四日電）</p>

<h3>糧食浦江米市轉活</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源約三十號左右、本街交易、緣天時睛正、市盤反硬、北粳頂貨又增角許、中關白粳到亦無幾、客帮及本街更活、市價又昂數分、洋蘆尖與客尖到湧銷淡、回落半角、變陰二元酒户不動、形勢下游、</p>
<p>北市　昨日來源不多、城鄕店胃揀頂尚殷、客帮路　無錫崑山米叄硬二角、洋廬尖貨難不多、上棧則有、市呈定局、早稍薄到銷二平、故趨勢喊起五分、北帮變元無榮辱、河下船貨斛開五千石、</p>
<h3>洋米漲風愈熾</h3>
<p>現米突漲三角：期貨跳起一錢二</p>
<p>長江内地去胃更濃：共開二萬包</p>
<p>昨日洋米况、愈形活躍、因有軍需之外、實銷帮胃口激增、長江一路之漢口、自去年水災以後、迄呈缺糧之勢、近日各地市面漸復、需米甚殷、除湘贛辦去若干外、依然不足應銷、故連日在市購買甚頗、、此外如江北一路及鎭江南京各地一致來申採辦、江浙内地各區與本街鄕莊胃口亦濃、而産地歉收、後路不繼、因此人心大佳、囤買過問、市面立呈飛黄騰達之局面矣、昨日開出共有二萬左右、計一號西貢五千包、價十一元三角至二角半、茄粳地三百包、價十一元二角七分、小絞米一萬五千包、價十元○二角至一角半、中次十元至九元九角、較前日漲有二三角、期貨開五月份回籠貨五百噸、價四兩八錢半至七分、比前市較大有一錢二分云、</p>
<h3>北方需胃漸次見增粉價横跳不已</h3>
<p>昨粉市復呈暴騰之象、以各路存底不豐、時當春暮、銷化已活、北方胃口、逐步推進、兼之洋麥報價步佳、匯率又低、對於粉市之高昻昂、已無控制之能力、（前傳俄方辦粉裝至海參威、現在確實調查實係賑災粉、數約五十餘萬包、前昨已經出口）廠家方面、標凖旣經結價、當此轉機之時、自亦樂於喊高、（聞四月底止之廠盤、客帮已有批定、開至二兩一錢五分二厘半、）所以人心奇佳、四月分開價即較前日喊高一分、自後逐喊逐高、而價竟高至二兩一錢二分半净、計漲二分二厘半、五月份因人心之激昂、開價即高二分左右、後則至二兩一錢五分二厘半、計漲三分、至兵船廠盤、昨喊二兩一錢五分扣、照内外銷如是緊俏、後步尚看繼好云、</p>
<h3>三千餘包洋麥傳裝運出口</h3>
<p>小麥市面、久少問訊、昨聞存棧之洋麥、廠方肯吃四兩一錢半、行家則板價四兩二錢、故無成交、惟據出口業之傳述、昨有三千餘包之洋麥、裝運出口、地點尚未詳細、此事如確、後步亦看高貴云、</p>
<h3>南北貨蘭竹枝高貨獨缺</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝近日乏到、市上號存以中次爲多、高貨獨缺、故連日少數開出、市價不上四十兩、良以貨品夾雜、兼有破壳霉蛀等、極難得價、而去胃亦覺呆滯、並聞粤屬産區、花苗尚佳、如經過良好、則本届新貨可望豐收云、</p>
<h3>疋頭藍條漂布復跌</h3>
<p>本廠棉布、連日趨勢甚疲、各帮需胃清淡、軍裝去路亦告停頓故昨日起各價均見跌風、觀察後步、一時間恐難轉機、昨十一磅粗布又見小面、草牛人鏡售四兩六錢半、三兎三貓四兩七錢、九磅布寗波帮辦去貓鷹五十件、價四兩三錢七分半、三雞四兩二錢七分半、團體承銷之雙英五鹤牌布、現貨仍缺、抛與軍裝後、未曾交清之故、湖北粗布尚挺、祿字開八兩三錢、天字八兩一錢半、粗斜較前活動、十四磅人塔六兩一錢半、十二磅三魚五兩二錢半、昨成交四五十件、藍條漂布復跌、書生圖八兩三錢、五福八兩六錢、細布細斜亦較前爲軟云、</p>

<h3>棋局</h3>
<p>— ·王·西·神</p>
<p>不和不戰態紆徐。棋局中心更不如。成竹當胸何俶詭。空花照眼足軒渠。會開圓桌人爲俎。國有方城我是魚。覆瓿三都平子賦。苟全無地覓華胥。</p>
<p>十日輕寒一日晴。小樓忙殺賣花聲。霓裳風亂三千隊。樓閣雲迷十二城。潑眼穢春驕海國。驚心芳序過清明。撩人最是墻東角。蠂使蜂媒無限情。</p>
<h3>日報記者之覺醒語天恨</h3>
<p>一二八之變。日駐滬海軍司令監澤。狃於甲午日清之役。及東北九一八之變。心目中早無中國。故雖獲得多方對於四條件之完全承認。仍不以爲滿足。必欲佔領淞滬而後快。曰。日本軍隊之掃蕩淞滬華軍。但四小時即可畢事矣。孰意自一二八發難後。竟增援十餘次。四易其司令。猶相持一月以上。我軍因無後援。瀏河被襲。始全師而退。日軍人之大陸迷夢。其亦可以已乎。當滬戰旣作。日軍屢敗之際。日報某記者曾有言。謂今日之中國。已非甲午時代之中國。而十九路軍。亦非龍旗辮髮之隊可比。蓋中國人民已經覺醒。非復昔日之不解愛國。觀於滬人充分予十九路軍以物質的精神的援助。即屬覺醒之明證。斯言誠然。且不但滬人能熱烈愛國也。李想容在首都清唱時。</p>
<p>每登台。輒先作簡短演説。勸人愛國。繼復唱自編之抗日京曲一折。激勵座客。（頗慷慨動人惜以篇幅關係曲詞從略）夫想容。一鬻歌之小女子耳。猶能知愛國。可見我全國人民。非復如甲午時之沉沉酣睡矣。</p>
<h3>弄猴者言</h3>
<p>— 碧城</p>
<p>軍作鴿、軍用犬。時見報章。近又有軍用猴之喧傳。謂猴最敏捷。可教之擲炸彈。彼其升高迅疾。攀援便利。又身軀小。易避敵彈。聞我國某軍。方着手訓練軍用猴。他日成功。能超出鴿與犬之上。而别樹一幟。可無欵也。惟俗有青肚皮猢猻一語。借以况笨伯。謂屢教之而終不能學也。某日見有弄猴者。問以猴之能演戲與否。先時有無識别。并間有無所謂青肚皮猢猻者。弄猴者笑曰。青肚皮。却不知。不過我道中人。固有試騐猴子的方法。初時。將若干猴子閉於一室。飼以食。瓦盆各一。教以食畢。須把瓦盆戴於頭上。不爾則撻之。旣諄諄教之。飼猴者乃出門去。反扃其門。窺於門隙。衆猴旣食畢。有如法以瓦盆戴頭一者。亦有不戴者。飼猴者故作門響。如啓門狀。其未戴者。急取盆加於頂。門仍未啓。則又將瓦盆取下。少頃。門再響。則仍急急戴上。飼猴者一一默記之。以狡點有智者爲可教而教之戲。果易教成。其始終戴盆若木偶不稍動移者。不可教。教之亦不易成。倘所謂青肚皮猢猻。非耶。然則今之訓練軍用猴者。愼勿一槪取之。而有青肚皮猢猻濫厠其間也。</p>
<h3>滬戰與軍器（十）</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>柔鼻彈　原名達姆達姆彈。Dum　Dum　Bullet係印度達姆達姆市的的工廠所出。一種尖頭的槍彈。性奇毒。命中這彈。。遍身膨脹。無藥可治憹即觸了彈往。皮膚的要潰爛。一八九九年英國與南阿非利加的波亞戰争時。用這毒彈。慘殺敵軍。海牙和平會議條約。載明禁上使用。後來仍破約秘密使用。至一九一二年。國際和平會議。再行禁止。歐洲大戰爆發。慘無人道之國。又蹂躪條約。大用此彈。大戰告終。一九二二年華盛頓會議。英美法意等國。三訂禁用條約。不料這次滬戰。我軍將士。竟遭這毒彈的重創</p>
<p>毒菌　戰争原爲人類最慘酷的行爲。而使用毒瓦斯毒彈。尤爲人道上所不容。最近又發明了還要厲害的毒物。名呌毒菌。就是用各種猛烈的傳染病菌所造成。裝在放射器内。射入廣大的敵陣。那末不但對於在戰鬥行爲的敵人。予以致命傷。即無辜的平民。也要完全死亡了。惟毒菌的使用方法。容竟如何。還没有宣布。大約將病菌裝在炸彈中。或裝在砲彈中發射。或帶在飛機上撒下。所以未來的戰争。眞不堪設想啊。</p>
<h3>逃（下）</h3>
<p>— 程明祥</p>
<p>伊只在一想到那些，就覺這國難眞在臨自已的頭了。淺蘋更比他的妻担心，凡是逃難時所有的恐怖，麻煩和危險，此刻都榮廻在他意識間而莫能拂拭。早把他以前日軍初犯瀋陽在校中慷慨激昻地就義勇軍司令時的勇氣全部消失了。聽得逃而最高興的是淺蘋的兩個孩子，他們知道明天有帶往鄕下去玩的機會，使很盼望明天早的到來</p>
<p>（少爺，××路汪有電話，）晚上十點鐘，他們差不金已把行李全收拾好了，傭婦進來這樣説。</p>
<p>隔了許久，淺蘋而上帶着這幾天不經見的笑意跑來説：（不要逃了，不心逃了！）</p>
<p>（爲什麽？）妻問：</p>
<p>（少爺，是不是天下已太平了，所以不必逃了嗎？）傭婦也問：</p>
<p>（我們又打了勝仗了，所以不必逃了，並且逃也很危險，今天下鄕去的船，）</p>
<p>被匪全部洗刦，眞可怕！）於是淺蘋便把電話中得來的消息告知妻，説×城已經義勇軍克復，軍事方面很有進展，暫時可以不必逃了。妻聽説可以不逃，好像國難已過了，覺得很爲釋然。小孩子們則彷彿失去了遊伴似的，鼓起着小腮，表示不高興。</p>
<p>一切民忙碌，在現在想來是可笑的了！</p>
<p>吃晚飯時，一家人仍然舒服地在自已精美的房舍裏。妻忽想起了蘋也是義勇軍，便問：</p>
<p>（你們校裏的義勇軍，怎麽不見了？）</p>
<p>（要不是得了捷報，明天我們便要在鄕下用晚餐了！）淺蘋答非所問地説。同時在口角浮上了一個愧漸的笑。心上在想：（待他們反攻過去了以後，我不是仍然要在操塲上耀武揚威的做司令的嗎？）</p>

<p>言</p>
<h3>前閘北</h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>昨接仲𨳐君寄來一文，問曰閘北爲�</p>
<p>誰屬，不佞特爲之整理其辭，并引伸其義，以與讀者諸君一商榷焉，前日翻閲本報，無意中發現一段廣告，原文如左，</p>
<p>（某某兩律師受任前閘北某某當常年法律顧問）</p>
<p>我見以以上這段廣告，殊爲駭異，蓋閘北爲我國固有之領土現在雖被敵人暫時强佔，然而閘北仍爲我國的閘北無疑，因爲我中華民國，旣未將閘北割讓於任何一國，而各，亦未曾否認閘北爲非我國之領土，則該閘北無論如何，仍完全爲我中華民國領土之閘北，其義昭然，何待辭費，此種淺顯之理，即未曾研究過法律的人，亦應共明，　　而該廣告謂，前閘北某某當云云，我不解年謂前者，其意云何，豈前者爲閘北，而今非閘北耶？豈前者爲我國之閘北，而後者非我國之閘北耶？前者對於後者之稱，不知何有月何日以前爲前閘北，何月何日以後爲後閘北耶？粗看其文，殊覺　突，細繹其義，更爲糢糊，　　若謂該當自經閘北戰事以後，業已停止營業，故前之云者，指某某當而言，不知該律師旣受任爲某某當常年法律顧問則前日之某某當、猶是今日之某某當，，其名旣經存在，則其當亦必仍在，非前某某當之外，後更有某某當也，　　若謂前者是營業時之某某當，後者爲停止營業時之某某當，則前字亦應加於某某當之上，不應加在閘北之上，并且該當旣聘請該律師爲常年法律顧問，則該當營業時之法益，固當保障，即停止營業時之法益，該律師亦當保障，若冠以前字，則前日之某某當，該律師爲之保障，而後日之某某當，該律師即可不必保障矣，</p>
<p>總之我國文字，非常含混，在此緊急關頭，須加以以當之注意，否則易使人滋疑也，</p>

<h3>滬難新樂府</h3>
<p>— 夢苕盦主</p>
<p>開和議</p>
<p>今日開和議，明日開和議，似聞閘北將成甌脱地，今日商撤兵，明日商撤兵，太倉城外日夜聞戰聲，折衝果無才，何如議弗開，停戰戰仍烈，何如兵弗撤，嗟致尸位郭彙駝，委佗委佗顔則那，自誇壇坫舌猶在，一籌不展將奈何，反云和議中梗不足慮，何有聯盟可申訴，即云聯盟果足恃，我刃胡爲弗再試，光榮之史血染成，勸君莫尋城下盟，</p>
<h3>勉青年</h3>
<p>— 柱尊</p>

<h3>反動</h3>
<p>— 柱尊</p>
<p>年來何處不危塗，異已人人反動誅，誰恤蕭牆同志血，美傾滅國一家姝，防民有稦衝川終潰，䌧錯從今鐵已無，可惜河山雖信美，漸芽吾土只長吁，</p>

        <h1>1932.04.16</h1>
<h3>Dr. Rugg</h3>
<p>The renowned American educator, Dr. H. Rugg, recently arrived in Shanghai. Dr. Rugg originally studied engineering before turning to education. He now specializes in research on (curriculum reform) and is considered one of the most progressive figures in the American education field. He is quite dissatisfied with the current capitalist education system in the United States. He has come to China to, first, observe the impact of East-West cultural contact, and second, to examine the general phenomena of the cultural sphere in China, which is currently in a state of flux and transformation. We would like to express our sincere welcome to this guest who has traveled so far for the sake of human culture. At the same time, we cannot help but say a word.</p>
<p>The United States is a country where modern capitalism has reached its peak. The development of its domestic education, the scale of its schools, and the grandeur of its facilities are unmatched by any other country in the world. Therefore, American education can almost be said to be the highest archetype of capitalist education. However, the best models of education should not only focus on the grandeur of material aspects. What is even more important is another kind of lively, healthy, free, and progressive (vitality), and education under the capitalist system is clearly very deficient in this essential (vitality). Taking the United States as an example, American education today is clearly commercialized. The focus of education is entirely controlled by the capitalist class. The fanaticism of (competition) and (utilitarianism) dominates the entire education system. The relationship between professors and students has become purely the selling of knowledge, and the school administration is almost entirely dominated by pragmatists with only commercial minds. All of this proves that American education is entirely a tool for capitalism, creating slaves, rather than creating free people for society, and it is still completely unaware of this. This is the biggest and unavoidable flaw of capitalist education. Therefore, we believe that this kind of education needs to be fundamentally destroyed.</p>
<p>China is a country with backward production and is dominated by the dual evil forces of imperialism and feudalism. Today, it is in a state of decline and is in an extremely difficult situation. Due to economic backwardness and political dysfunction, its culture and education are in a state of decline, dilapidation, and aging, which is undeniable. Dr. Rugg will also be able to make correct observations and recognize the correct facts. However, what we must especially point out is that on the other side of today's (dark China), there are still many (seekers of light) who are working hard and striving to create a new culture and a new education. We dare to guarantee that this arduous struggle will succeed. (The young China) will surely be presented to the world through this struggle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reason why we believe that Dr. Rugg's visit to our country has a special significance compared to the visits of Dewey, Kilpatrick, and others is that Dr. Rugg was originally an engineering scholar before turning to education. The principle held by engineers in architecture is to destroy what is outdated and unusable, preserve what is excellent, and create something brand new. The principle of education is also inseparable from this. Therefore, Dr. Rugg's dedication to the study of education with his knowledge and experience in engineering will surely lead to great achievements. However, we believe that there are (new) and (old) engineers, and there are also new and old educators. (Old) engineers only build palaces for emperors and pavilions and mansions for special classes. (New) engineers build houses for the majority of people, build public libraries, parks, and all kinds of buildings that meet the needs of the majority of people. Old educators only create obedient subjects for emperors, slaves for rulers, and successors for the old era. New educators create healthy free people for society and (workers) with creative abilities for the new era. Dr. Rugg is an engineering scholar and an educator, and his thinking is not limited to the splendor and opulence of the current capitalist world. We dare to assert that he will surely make great contributions to the future of education.</p>
<p>We already know that Dr. Rugg has come to our country to, first, observe, and second, collect facts in order to create a (new education) blueprint. However, we dare to say to Dr. Rugg that there are also many (new educators) in China today who are working hard on the research of (new education) blueprints. We sincerely hope that the new educators of the East and the West can work together to strive for the great success of advancing the great wheel of the times.</p>
<h3>Special Committee of the League of Nations to Meet Today</h3>
<p>The Committee of Nineteen to Discuss the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>Chinese Delegation Submits Memorandum</p>
<p>Shanghai Armistice Negotiations Transferred for Handling</p>
<p>Japanese Side's Strong Attitude Refuses to Participate</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th – Foreign Minister Hymans of Belgium today conferred with Japanese representatives Sato and Nagaoka, Chinese representative Yen Hui-ching, and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond regarding the Committee of Nineteen's meeting tomorrow to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Japanese side's attitude towards the Shanghai armistice negotiations is particularly strong, so the general public has many speculations about the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, and the situation appears quite complex.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 15th – The Chinese representative recently submitted a memorandum to the League of Nations Secretary-General. The Committee of Nineteen will meet tomorrow, and the Chinese memorandum specifically states the various methods China has taken or will take to implement the League of Nations Council resolution for the Committee of Nineteen's reference. The memorandum states that the methods adopted by China have been rendered completely ineffective due to the attitude of the Japanese government. The irregular state of the three northeastern provinces is caused by Japan's failure to comply with the Council resolution, so Japan should bear the responsibility. The Chinese memorandum also draws the following conclusion from the course of various events: the main obstacle to a compromise between China and Japan lies in the different interpretations of the term (How to effectively protect the safety of Japanese lives and property) within the extraterritorial railway zone and on Chinese territory outside it. According to the Chinese government's interpretation, the so-called security conditions are to ensure the lives and property of Japanese residents are not subject to retaliation after the Japanese troops withdraw. This interpretation was clearly endorsed by several members of the Council at the meetings on October 23 and 24, and the then Council Chairman Briand also advocated this. This condition, including police issues, belongs to the administrative scope, and may also include military issues, which can be resolved quickly. This is the Chinese government's opinion, which is the natural interpretation of the principle of safety of life and property. Unfortunately, the Japanese government has always regarded this as a kind of protection plan to make Manchuria a political and economic protectorate, and wants to rely on the pressure of the Japanese army's occupation to force the Chinese government to recognize it during direct negotiations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th – It is heard that the Japanese member of the Committee of Nineteen organized by the League of Nations to handle the Sino-Japanese issue will offer the following explanation for the failure of the Shanghai armistice conference: It is said that Chinese students intimidated the Chinese chief representative, claiming that if a humiliating armistice treaty is signed, they will definitely attack and kill him, so the chief representative used illness as an excuse to hide in a hospital in the French Concession. The Japanese side here claims that the difficulties regarding Dr. Wellington Koo's visit to the three northeastern provinces still exist. The Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to meet tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th – Reuters learned from reliable sources today that the Japanese government will instruct the Japanese representatives in Geneva that if the Committee of Nineteen accepts the Chinese government's request to handle the Shanghai armistice treaty, the Japanese representatives must refuse to join. According to the Japanese side, this Chinese request is only a tactic for China to avoid reaching an agreement in Shanghai. It is heard that Japan is prepared to explain the course of the Shanghai negotiations to the League of Nations if necessary, but insists on not transferring the armistice negotiations to Geneva for handling.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – As a result of consultations among government leaders, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa sent the following telegram to the Japanese delegation in Geneva: The Committee of Nineteen, which will be held tomorrow, the 16th, was convened based on the resolution of March 11 without Japan's consent, so it is difficult for Japan to recognize it. The Japanese representative has no need to attend. If the committee requests an explanation regarding the Shanghai ceasefire conference, then the director of the League of Nations affairs, Sawada, will be instructed to explain it. Since Japan does not recognize the committee, it will also not recognize its resolutions.</p>
<h3>Sun Fo and Zhang Huichang Visited Lin Sen Together Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sun's Visit to Nanjing Still Undetermined</p>
<p>National Government Chairman Lin Sen personally visited Sun Fo's residence on Route Mollière at ten o'clock yesterday morning to meet with Sun Fo and urge him to go to Nanjing to jointly overcome the national crisis. After detailed talks for an hour, there were still no concrete results. Lin left at eleven o'clock and returned to his residence on Rue Père Huc for lunch. At a little after one o'clock, Sun Fo, accompanied by Guangdong Air Force Commander Zhang Huichang, went to Lin's residence to meet him. Zhang reported on a detailed plan to expand the air force, which Lin greatly praised. They left at two o'clock. In addition, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Quo Tai-chi and Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Commander Dai Ji visited Lin's residence at ten o'clock yesterday morning, but did not meet him. According to sources close to Lin, Lin's return to Nanjing has not yet been determined. Also, according to sources close to Sun, rumors about Sun are mostly speculation. Sun's opinions have already been expressed, that is, he has no personal problems, but he cannot compromise on political views. Whether to go to Luoyang or not is not a matter of great importance.</p>
<h3>Quo Tai-chi Went to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Flying with Huang Qiang</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Quo Tai-chi went to visit Chairman Lin yesterday and then went to Longhua Airport at two o'clock in the afternoon to take a China National Aviation Corporation plane to Nanjing. Quo's trip was very secretive, and even the Foreign Affairs Office knew little about it. It is said that the only person accompanying Quo was Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army. As for the purpose of his trip, it is to make a detailed report to the government authorities on the situation of the repeated meetings.</p>
<h3>Japan Reportedly Withdrawing Troops Again</h3>
<p>Number Not Specified</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th – The Ministry of the Army announced today that it has issued instructions to withdraw some Japanese troops from Shanghai again. However, the number was not specified.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Japanese Army on the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 15th – Recently, the front lines have been calm with no fighting, but Japanese aircraft are very active, reconnoitering our positions and rear areas daily. At about eight o'clock on the morning of the 15th, a Japanese aircraft arrived in Suzhou, circling the city once before leaving. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, another aircraft came to reconnoiter, flying very low and the sound was heard throughout the city. The British and American expatriates in Suzhou believe that this kind of activity by the Japanese is a provocation and are discussing sending a telegram to the American and British ambassadors to persuade Japan to stop. At Kunshan, a Japanese aircraft arrived at 11:30 in the morning, reconnoitering for a long time before leaving. More than fifty enemy vehicles were parked at the Liuhe train station on the 15th, with unclear intentions. The original five or six hundred Japanese troops at Lutu Bridge now number only three or four hundred. There are over a thousand enemies at Liuhe and over a hundred at Xintangshi. Enemy warships are constantly moving up and down in the Changshu River. Anting is calm.</p>
<h3>U.S. Entire Fleet Plans to Station Permanently in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Washington, 14th – A source in the U.S. Navy Department claimed today that the department is currently considering stationing the entire U.S. fleet in the Pacific indefinitely. However, the order has not yet been issued. Currently, the leading figures in the department are discussing issuing this order, as the emergency situation in the Far East is obviously of a continuing nature. In addition, it is heard that the U.S. Department of State has proposed that the cruiser fleet that sailed to Honolulu and the West Coast for maneuvers a few weeks ago remain in the Pacific (without returning to the Atlantic, but sources in the Navy Department are unwilling to confirm it). However, observing the situation, the State Department's opinion is obviously part of a plan to reorganize the Navy Department's fleet allocation.</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports that, according to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department, in view of the prolonged severe situation in the Far East, is currently considering keeping the entire national fleet temporarily in the Pacific after the maneuvers are completed, so that it can easily be deployed to the East in case of emergency. This news is of great value to observe in the Far East. Therefore, the current movements of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet are also presumably something readers want to know. According to news from the U.S. Naval Purchasing Office in this port, the U.S. ship Rochester will arrive in Shanghai on May 5, while there is no definite news about the aircraft carrier Langley. The aircraft carrier Jason is currently en route to Guam. The U.S. Army transport ship Republic is scheduled to arrive in Manila on June 17 and will make a short stop in Shanghai before heading to Qinhuangdao. Also, regarding the movements of U.S. ships this week, the gunboat Paul Jones will sail to the Yangtze River, replacing the Parrott. The Gufoor is sailing to Nanjing, and the two gunboats Dotoo and Barrow are currently docked in Hankou. The Barey is sailing to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the Wuhu is stationed in Yichang, the Gumm is stationed in Chongqing, and the Tulsa is currently inspecting the hull in Shanghai. The Sacramento is coming to Shanghai. As for South China, the two ships Mindanao and Hillilla are in Hong Kong, and the Smith Thompson is docked in Xiamen. In addition, three destroyers, including the Borie, are practicing shelling in Manila.</p>
<h3>19th Route Army Soldiers Swear Not to Recognize Japanese Proposals</h3>
<p>Exceeding Principles, Infringing on Our Sovereignty</p>
<p>If They Dare to Offend, We Will Fight to the End</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited the person in charge of the 19th Route Army's rear office. According to him, all the soldiers of the 19th Route Army are very indignant about the various proposals of the Japanese side at the ceasefire conference, which are all outside the basic principles and harm our national sovereignty, making it absolutely impossible for us to recognize them. Our Chinese army loves peace, but is absolutely unafraid of the aggression of the violent. If the Japanese army really wants to invade, our army will resist for self-defense. We are now waiting for the League of Nations to explain the method of troop withdrawal. If the Japanese side takes military action without complying with the League of Nations resolution, our army will naturally be adequately prepared. This ceasefire conference was not convened because our side was defeated, but was ordered by the League of Nations to be held. Our army is not afraid of Japan, because we have already experienced the Japanese army's combat record in the past three months. Moreover, since our army took the lead in resisting Japan, the various armies are also sharing the same hatred and are willing to fight the Japanese army to the end.</p>
<h3>The Two Railways Bureau Asks All Parties to Pay Attention to Two Railways Transportation</h3>
<p>Chen Xinghan, the director of the two railways bureau, believes that Woosung is the main depot for repairing vehicles of the entire railways line, North Station is the starting point of Beijing-Shanghai transportation, and Maigen Road Station is the connecting station for Beijing-Hangzhou joint transportation. In case of being included in the Japanese army's temporary stationing range, the two railways transportation will be hindered. He specially requested the Ministry of Railways, and also sent letters to the China British Bank Corporation and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Quo Tai-chi to take care of the railway area. The said letters and documents have been published by the railways bureau as follows.</p>
<p>To the Ministry of Railways (1) Xing humbly reports that the Japanese side is still requesting to designate locations in Woosung, Jiangwan, and Zhabei as stations for the withdrawing troops. North Station is the starting point of Beijing-Shanghai transportation, Maigen Road is the connecting station for Beijing-Hangzhou joint transportation, and Woosung is the location of the entire line's vehicle repair depot. In case of being included in the Japanese army's stationing range, the vital points of this railways will be completely lost, and Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou transportation will be hindered. In addition to having sent a letter to Vice Minister Quo to Beijing, requesting him to take care of the railways area in the troop withdrawal negotiations, I should report and beg your Ministry for verification and grant consultation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (2) Wu is writing to request the matter. According to the report from the machine affairs department of the bureau, the Woosung machine depot of our office has been extremely difficult to repair and assemble locomotives since the Japanese army occupied it. Recently, I read in the newspapers of the 16th of this month that the Japanese side at the Sino-Japanese armistice conference even proposed to require the army to retreat only to the line of Zhenru and Shizilin. It is extremely astonishing. Regarding the Woosung machine depot, the depot manager, Mao Erwei, still travels back and forth from time to time. According to the observation of the depot's situation, the Japanese army is arbitrarily destroying it more and more every day. If this continues, I am afraid that everything will be destroyed together, etc. I humbly think that the Woosung machine depot is an important place for the repair and assembly of locomotives on the two railways. The scale of the Zhabei depot is small, and the repair and assembly of locomotives on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line is already a forced response. Now, for the sake of emergency, a small portion of the work has been ordered to be supplied by that depot, and requests have been made to the Jinpu Bureau to manufacture and to various factories in Changshu and Suzhou and Shanghai to rush to prepare, so as not to delay. However, it has been found that the number of locomotives damaged and waiting for repair on the Beijing-Shanghai line has already accounted for one-third. This kind of ordinary work is difficult to undertake. If we request the Jinpu Railways to repair them, the transportation across the river will be even more difficult. Although this railways has a plan to set up a new depot, even if it is actively carried out, it will not be completed in a short time. Currently, what is hoped is that the Woosung machine depot can be recovered as soon as possible, so that it can be reorganized and applied as soon as possible, and on the other hand, prepare for a new depot, so as to fully supply. Otherwise, the damage to locomotives will increase day by day, and there will be no way to repair them, which will inevitably lead to a risk of suspension. The case concerning railways affairs is not shallow and fresh. Being where my duties lie, I dare not remain silent. Should I ask your Bureau to forward it to the Ministry for handling and to make clear to the diplomatic personnel responsible for the Sino-Japanese armistice conference what to pay attention to, I should submit a document for inspection and implementation, which is for public convenience.</p>

<p>To Vice Minister Quo: The first time I saw Vice Minister's Xunjian, I traced back to the outbreak of the Shanghai incident, the spread of war, and you, sir, with your talent for diplomatic negotiations, went out to respond to the important task of putting an end to the war. Your loyalty, bravery, and planning for the country are admirable. The losses of our railways due to this war are very significant, and we have repeatedly received your concern. Both the public and private sectors feel the same way. However, according to reports, the Japanese side is still requesting to designate locations in Woosung, Jiangwan, and Zhabei as stationing points for the withdrawing troops. Cha Shangbei is the starting point for Beijing-Shanghai transportation, Maigen Road is the connecting station for Beijing-Hangzhou joint transportation, and Woosung is also the location of the entire line's vehicle repair depot. In the event that it is designated as the stationing range for the withdrawing troops of the Japanese side, the vital points of our railways will be lost, and the entire line of traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou route will be hindered. I dare to write to beg you, sir, to take into account the traffic in the railways area in the troop withdrawal negotiations. The future is deeply dependent on it. My heart is in danger and my words are clumsy. I beg you to understand.</p>
<p>To the Bank Corporation: Respectfully, according to reports, the new strategy of the Japanese side at the ceasefire conference is still to request that designated locations in Woosung, Jiangwan, and Zhabei be used as stationing points for the withdrawing troops. Cha Shangbei is the starting point for Beijing-Shanghai transportation, Maigen Road is the connecting station for Beijing-Hangzhou joint transportation, and Woosung is also the location of the entire line's vehicle repair depot. In the event that it is designated as the stationing range for the withdrawing troops of the Japanese side, the vital points of the factory road will be lost, and the two railways transportation will be hindered. The interests of the two railways bondholders represented by your company will also be indirectly affected. I dare to write to ask you to find a way to request the British representative at the council to take into account the interests of our railways in the troop withdrawal negotiations. The future of transportation is deeply dependent on it. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Reply from the Bank Corporation: (1) Respectfully replying, I received your letter, which stated that according to reports, at the ceasefire conference, there is a saying that the Japanese army is still stationing troops in the Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Woosung areas, which greatly hinders the traffic and vehicle repairs of your railways, and asked us to ask the British representative at the council to pay attention, etc. I am extremely eager to realize the return of the North Station and Woosung machine depot to your railways. I have already submitted this proposal to the British Legation for handling. As for the importance of your bureau's recovery of all property management in order to restore the original state and resume normal traffic, I think your bureau has already requested the peace representatives of your country to handle it. (2) Respectfully, I received your letter and a copy of your railways' report on the estimated losses due to the destruction caused by the Japanese army in the Sino-Japanese War, which is very kind. I think your bureau will definitely submit this loss to your country's representative in the future in order to demand compensation. I have received this loss record for reference, and I am deeply grateful. I plan to send a summary copy to our head office in London for verification.</p>

The battalion commander resisted vigorously, and the enemy soldiers were killed and wounded six or seven hundred people. The battalion also suffered heavy losses, and Battalion Commander Luo died on the spot. This is a very glorious page in the history of the Anti-Japanese War. It is specially recorded. The posthumous portrait of Battalion Commander Luo is on the right.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member He Xiangning Encourages Sun Yuanliang, Commander of the 259th Brigade</h3>
<p>Two Poems Gifted to Frontline Soldiers and Beloved Wounded</p>
<p>Sun Yuanliang, commander of the 259th Brigade of the 87th Division of the Army, distinguished himself in the battles of Caojiadu Bridge and Miaohang during this operation. Central Committee member He Xiangning, considering Commander Sun a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy and the fact that Mr. Liao Zhongkai was serving as the party representative of the school at that time, indirectly regarded him as a senior disciple. Yesterday, He Xiangning specially sent a letter to encourage the frontline soldiers of the brigade. The original text is extracted below:</p>
<p>(To Comrade Yuanliang, forward to the frontline soldiers, the Japanese invaders, their ambition has not died. They have already occupied our three northeastern provinces and now occupy our Shanghai territory. Alas, our great rivers and mountains are not what they used to be. Artillery has destroyed many of our cities, brutally massacred many of our compatriots, and raped many of our women. Thinking of you all as courageous soldiers, how can you swallow this anger? And He also gifted the beloved wounded, saying, "You shed blood, I shed tears. The beautiful land is being seized by others, increase your courage and quickly go to the battlefield to recover our lost territory. Good men, not afraid to die for the country, your names will be remembered for ten thousand generations.")</p>
<h3>Negotiating with American Shipping Company to Transport Overseas Chinese from Japan Back Home</h3>
<p>Navigation Bureau Ordered to Contact Dollar Steamship Company</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, all overseas Chinese in Japan have been living in fear. Students and the wealthy have already returned home one after another. Small business owners have also been transported back in batches by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinming vessel. However, there are still some stranded on the Japanese archipelago. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially requested the Ministry of Transportation to instruct Shanghai</p>
<p>The Navigation Bureau and Shipping Association to negotiate with the American Dollar Steamship Company to have the company's ships carry our overseas Chinese home when passing through Yokohama. After receiving the order, the bureau, led by Director Xi Dingmo, personally negotiated with the Shipping Association and Dollar Steamship Company yesterday, and made preparations for everything. It is expected to be implemented soon. It is reported that the overseas Chinese in Japan have been ordered to gather at the port of Yokohama in order to board the ships at that time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Impersonating Chinese Vessels Attempt to Seize Inland Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>Colluding with Traitors to Establish Shipping Bureaus</p>
<p>Raising Chinese Flags to Sail in Xinghua and Quanzhou</p>
<p>Conspiracy Discovered and Request Made to Prohibit Navigation</p>
<p>After the war front shifted westward, Japanese ships on the North and South Seas and the Yangtze River have gradually resumed sailing, carrying Japanese goods. However, in the ports of Xinghua and Quanzhou in Fujian, which are not treaty ports, Japanese ships cannot sail. However, the Japanese are still plotting to seize these rights. Recently, a Japanese shipping merchant colluded with traitors, using the name of Chinese merchants to organize shipping bureaus and obtain the right to sail in the inland areas of Xinghua and Quanzhou in Fujian. This has been discovered by our Chinese navigators, who have publicly requested the Fujian Maritime Customs to prohibit their sailing in order to recover navigation rights and prevent accidents from occurring. Upon hearing the news, the reporter specially investigated and reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Falsely Establish Chinese Shipping Bureaus: A certain Japanese person colluded with a traitor named Li, etc., and specially used the name of Chinese merchants to organize the Yongyuan Shipping Company. Outwardly, it uses Li's name, but the power is controlled by the Japanese. Four Japanese ships were renamed Yongyuan, Shunyuan, Shunli, Chengli, etc., with Chinese names, and raised Chinese flags to obtain the right to sail in inland areas such as Xinghua and Quanzhou in Fujian. After the plan was completed, a management office was established in Shanghai, and a certain shipping bureau on Yong'an Street was entrusted to act as an agent for business.</p>
<p>Crew Members Discover the Conspiracy: Xinghua and Quanzhou are not treaty ports, and there are no consulates. Therefore, foreign crew members are not allowed to go there. The company then entrusted Li to telegraph Shanghai to hire Chinese shipmasters from the Master Mariners' Association. Crew members such as Jin Bingtang were hired on board, initially unaware that they were impersonating Chinese vessels. When Mr. Jin and others went to work on the ship, the truth came out, and they realized that the Yongyuan was purely owned by the Japanese. They were indignant and resigned, and returned to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Telegraph Request to Fujian Province to Stop Transportation: Yesterday, various Chinese shipping organizations in this port heard about this matter. Since traitors are helping the Japanese to impersonate Chinese vessels and navigate inland, it not only damages navigation rights, but also during this time of national crisis, when the country and the people are planning long-term resistance, the traitor's being used by the Japanese is even more obstructive to national affairs. Yesterday, after public discussion, telegrams were sent separately to various inland areas such as Xinghua and Quanzhou in Fujian, announcing that the company was not run by Chinese nationals, but was a fake, ordering all industrial and commercial circles in various ports to follow the example of not allowing foreign merchant ships to sail and not to load goods or take passengers. Also, when ships arrive, do not unload or transship them. A request was also submitted to the Fujian Maritime Customs Superintendent to not clear these fake ships, in order to prohibit them from sailing inland.</p>
<h3>International High-Level Skeet Shooting Competition: China and Portugal Set to Meet Again</h3>
<p>This Month's 27th and 28th</p>
<p>Li Gongying vs. Medina</p>
<p>In the Shanghai International High-Level Skeet Shooting Competition, Chinese Li Gongying defeated Medina in 1930 to win the championship. In the following year, 1931, Portuguese Medina defeated Li Gongying to win the championship. This year's sixteen strong players have gone through natural selection and still stand side by side. Those who look down on each other are again Li Gongying and Medina. It can be said that they are destined rivals, meeting every year. The competition will total two thousand points and will be held at the United China Association on the 27th and 28th of this month. At that time, there will be an unprecedented grand event.</p>
<h3>Supervision Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Officially Begins Operations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Temporarily Setting Up One Office, One Section, and One Committee</p>
<p>Responsible Personnel Have Been Appointed</p>
<p>Since the central government clearly ordered Chen Fumu to concurrently serve as the superintendent of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Chen has been busy with ministerial affairs and has not yet taken office. It is now known that Chen has decided to first establish a Supervision Office, selecting the entire third floor of the company as the office location, temporarily setting up a Secretariat, appointing Zeng Huiwen as director, an Audit Section, concurrently served by Zhu Suixuan, a member of the Yangtze River Regulation Committee of the Ministry of Transportation, and another Design Committee, composed of seven members, designating Gu Faming, counselor of the Ministry of Transportation, as the standing committee member and chairman. The above three departments began operating yesterday. It is reported that Chen will take office within days.</p>
<h3>Joint Telegram from Various Civic Organizations</h3>
<p>Opposing Humiliating Foreign Diplomacy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Various Civic Organizations held its first executive committee meeting yesterday. Representatives from fifteen organizations, including Wang Baozhen, He Jingmin, Zhang Juansheng, Zhang Yongzhi, Li Jie, Deng Cihou, Wang Zhisheng, Shen Zurru, Wang Anfu, Yan Jin, and Song An, attended. Wang Baozhen was elected chairman and Shen Zurru as recorder. In addition to the division of labor, more than ten important cases were passed (omitted). The text of their telegram is recorded below for the public appraisal of the national citizens. Since the violent Japanese occupation of the Northeast, followed by the Shanghai Incident, the country's affairs have deteriorated to the extreme. If we think about the origin of foreign troubles, it is nothing more than those in power vying for power and profit. Internally, there are years of war, and externally, they are willing to submit. However, even though the country's affairs are already like this, our people are still unwilling to make blame after the fact. If we can immediately realize and urgently seek ways to remedy the situation, the Chinese people should be patient and calm, and follow the leadership of the government. Now that the great disaster has already come, the diplomatic policy has not yet been determined, sometimes embracing the non-resistance policy, sometimes waiting quietly for the League of Nations to resolve the situation. The truce negotiations have lasted for a month, admitting the division of Zhabei, Wusong, Yinxiang, Jiangwan, and other key areas as occupied by enemy troops, willingly residing in the position of a defeated country. Recently, the British ambassador proposed three compromise measures, which are tantamount to sending our Shanghai to Japanese imperialism forever. The diplomatic authorities are using the technique of covering their ears to steal the bell, attempting to deceive the public. The so-called ceasefire meeting and transfer to the League of Nations are actually small group meetings that are still ongoing. Examining their intentions, they want to use excuses to shirk responsibility and divert the attention of our people in order to achieve their purpose of currying favor with foreigners and selling out the country. At this time of national survival, our people should be inspired by the duty of all to take responsibility and be afraid of the legacy of no intact eggs under an overturned nest. We vow to oppose this absurd diplomacy of willingly accepting humiliation. The telegram is indignant, and we hope that it will be understood. The Shanghai Federation of Various Civic Organizations bows.</p>
<h3>American Infantry Holds Review Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>Inviting Major General Hines to Review</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that the 31st Infantry Regiment of the US Army held a review ceremony at Zhangchang Racecourse this morning (15th) at 9:00 AM, inviting Major General Hines, former commander of the US Philippines Area, to review. Major General Hines has served in the US Army for 45 years and participated in the European War, with outstanding achievements. He also once served as Chief of Staff. After retiring this time and returning home, he will retire due to old age. Therefore, during his transit through Shanghai, he specially requested to review his old troops to express his farewell. General Hines arrived in Shanghai last night aboard the President Hoover, and this morning, accompanied by important figures from the US military, inspected the battlefield around Zhabei for a week. He then returned to the US on the original ship at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. (Note: General Hines has a reputation in the international community. When the Council of the League of Nations selected members of the Lytton Commission to investigate the Liaoning Incident last year, the American member intended to invite General Hines to serve, but because the general had just completed his term in the Philippines, he did not agree, and General McCoy was invited instead.)</p>

<h3>Huang Bingheng Resigns and Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Huang Bingheng, Director of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, has twice submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Military Affairs. Although he was retained, he was determined to resign, and yesterday he transferred from the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway to the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhang Feng's Antique Losses</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhang Feng, Acting Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Director of the Library of Jinan University, fled from his residence on campus on January 29. For months, he suffered from palpitations whenever he heard a loud noise. Dr. Zhang loves antiques and has accumulated quite a few over the past twenty years. This time, everything in his residence was completely lost to the Japanese invaders. Recently, he tried to go to his residence twice on the 6th and 9th of this month, and found that everything was gone. According to the list of losses, there are more than 120 items in the antique category, totaling more than 4,750 pieces, of considerable value. According to Dr. Zhang, there were the most ancient coins, but none of them were particularly famous. However, stone shovels and axes, etc., had considerable documentary corroboration. The "Duo Xiong Mu" tripod is sufficient to refute the saying of the time that it should be "(Duo Fu Duo Mu)". The "(Zi)" tripod is sufficient to prove that the word Zi is the same as the word (Fu). The Zhuguo Water Injection is already recorded and is said to be a national treasure. More than 50 Egyptian beetle seal , were exhibited at the Mingfu Library last year, and those who saw them praised them. Also, ancient documents and stone carvings from Egypt, Babylon, etc., are rarely seen by domestic collectors. Also, the negative of the Zhang Feng Dictionary and the manuscripts of the Standards for Popular Literacy are all works by him in the past five or six years. After Dr. Zhang lost all of these antiques and works, his spirit was depressed, but he still said, "Antiques are always disappearing, and history is always increasing. This time, the loss of 160,000,000 yuan in Zhabei, bought the resistance history of the Nineteenth Route Army, the people have no complaints, but see great excitement, which is also very commendable.")</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Citizens' National Products Promotion Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association held its 16th meeting of the 12th Executive Supervisory Committee yesterday. Sixteen people, including Xu Jianjun, attended, with Chen Yiting presiding. The following cases were discussed: (1) Reporting on the losses of the Zhabei National Products Exhibition. It was decided to first collect the amount of losses reported by each factory, and after a committee reviews and verifies them, report them to the Bureau of Social Affairs. Chen Binghui, Yiting, Xu Jianruo, Zhang Zhai, Zhang Baoshan, Fang Zege, and Shen Shuyu were publicly appointed as review members. (2) The Shantou Chao-Mei National Products Association held a National Products Exhibition and sent a letter requesting guidance from Shanghai factories to participate. It was decided to first reply to the letter and attach the regulations issued by the Ministry. Once the situation calms down, it will convene each factory to prepare for organization and participate as scheduled to promote sales in the southwest. (3) Assistance to the Wu Mai case. It was decided to send a letter to the Shanghai Local Court, requesting that it impartially and expeditiously try the case to protect human rights, and to publicly appoint Chen Yiting to express condolences and encourage him to continue his efforts. (4) The National Porcelain Enamel Business Office changed its representatives to assume executive duties. It was decided to approve. (5) The Huatong Electric Bulb Factory requested a broad certificate. It was decided to investigate the case and reply in accordance with the regulations. (6) Investigating the actual situation of the destruction of the Zhabei factories of the association's members. It was decided to hand over the investigation to the Investigation Section for a detailed reply in the shortest possible time in order to design relief and assistance measures. (7) Designing opportunities to promote national products. It was decided to hand over the design to the Propaganda Section and send separate letters to national product organizations in various provinces and cities to actively intensify the promotion of national products.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Zhejiang Economic Research Institute Re-examines Economic Situation</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Economic Research Institute of the National Government's Construction Committee is actively conducting an economic survey of Zhejiang Province and has completed more than half of the counties and cities in the province. More than ten volumes have been edited, statistically compiled, and printed into special volumes. As for the economic survey of Hangzhou City, it has long been completed and has already begun to be organized. However, the institute now believes that since the outbreak of the national crisis, the economy of Hangzhou City has plummeted, and the situation is bound to be inconsistent with the previous survey. Prematurely submitting it may be inaccurate. Therefore, recently, more than 20 clerks were dispatched to various districts of Hangzhou City to conduct a re-survey in order to be accurate, so that those outside who want to understand the economic situation of Hangzhou City can have a south needle.</p>
<h3>National Statistics on Exports to the United States</h3>
<p>Published by the US Consulate General</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that, according to the US Consulate General's publication, the total value of Chinese goods exported to the US in February was US$2,719,969. For January and February, the total value was US$5,328,5189. However, this only includes statistics on goods subject to ad valorem taxes according to the US tariff. Goods subject to specific duties are not included because there is no need to fill out a price list. Also, among the exports to the United States in the first two months of this year, gold bars were the most valuable, totaling US$2,045,147, with February alone accounting for US$1,707,883. The second was inedible animal products, totaling US$1,808,140 in two months, with February accounting for US$1,018,723. Textiles and their raw materials, which have always been the champion in exports to the United States, have plummeted, with only US$548,555 in February and only US$1,367,402 in January and February. Other items are even scarcer.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs Orders Workers' Savings to Be Organized</h3>
<p>Provisional Measures Have Been Promulgated by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Detailed Implementation Rules for the City Are Being Drafted</p>
<p>Because the Factory Workers Savings Law has not yet been promulgated in our country and at this time of extreme unemployment panic, it is imperative to organize workers' savings, and the provisions of Article 38 of the Factory Law and Article 15 of the Trade Union Law are too simple.

<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs Announces Extension of Deadline for Companies to Amend Articles of Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs recently received instructions from the Ministry of Industry stating that according to Article 1 of the Company Law, if any company's articles of association conflict with the Company Law, except as otherwise provided in the Implementing Regulations, they should be amended in accordance with the law within six months after the implementation of the Company Law (i.e., from July 20th to December of the same year) and submitted to the competent authority for registration with the Ministry. Now that the legal deadline has expired, but because there are or may be many companies located in remote areas with inconvenient transportation, requiring time for official documents to be submitted and transferred, or delays in convening shareholders' meetings, and various other practical difficulties, they have not been able to report the amendments to their articles of association as scheduled. With the approval of the Ministry of Industry, the Executive Yuan has extended the aforementioned deadline by six months, that is, extended to the end of June of this year. All companies that have not amended their articles of association in accordance with the law should comply with them within the deadline. After receiving the order, the bureau has forwarded this instruction to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify all companies.</p>

<h3>Major General Macnaghten Welcomes Chinese Directors</h3>

<h3>Great Panic Over Food Shortages in Jingjiang</h3>
<p>A guest from Jingjiang recounted the terrible food shortage situation in the county. What follows is a brief summary. Since the floods last year, informed individuals had anticipated a food shortage, but no one expected the current extreme difficulties. Currently, eight or nine out of ten rural residents lack sufficient food, especially in the Gushan area. Some have only one meal a day, others cannot even manage that, and some are even eating grass to survive. The primary cause is the flood, followed by the Japanese invasion. Even middle-class families must pay for "defense contributions" and "security contributions." Businesses and money houses have ceased operations; pawning is only for redemption, not for new loans. The wealthy are already struggling to maintain their lifestyle, while the poor naturally have no access to loans, forcing them to eat grass to stay alive. Recently, a tragic event occurred: a family of five in a certain surname near the town begged for food along the way, unable to fill their stomachs. They conceived a desire to end their lives. First, they bought poison and mixed it into the food, poisoning three children. Then, the husband and wife hanged themselves simultaneously. After several days, neighbors wondered why their door remained closed. Upon opening the door, they found all five family members completely dead from starvation. Alas, how tragic! Jingjiang is located opposite Jiangyin, only a few hundred miles from Nanjing. Do the compassionate officials even know about such a tragedy? The disasters in other areas far from the capital are beyond imagination. May our government authorities and philanthropists quickly find ways to help those left behind so that these dying people may have a glimmer of hope for survival. Otherwise, incidents such as the starving people of Changshu seizing rice will inevitably continue to occur.</p>

In order to maintain the students' studies and her personal dedication, Principal Xu initially planned to find a way to reopen the school at its original location as soon as possible. However, as the Japanese soldiers have not withdrawn and the students are hesitant to travel, it has been decided to temporarily relocate to the concession. They are currently looking for suitable premises, and as soon as a lease is secured, the school will reopen. It is also heard that the summer vacation will be suspended to make up for the delays of this term.</p>

<h3>Liuhe Refugees Displaced</h3>
<p>Landlord Orders Eviction in Four Hours</p>
<p>Great Panic Erupted Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The fifth Red Cross refugee shelter, located at 93 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, in the Public Concession, houses approximately two hundred men, women, and children, mostly from Liuhe in Taicang County. These refugees originally lived in the city building at 177 Avenue Edward VII, corner of Park Road. Recently, because the premises had been leased, they moved to the vacant rooms in Ren'an Lane on Wednesday of this week. Unexpectedly, after only three days, the landlord suddenly came to inspect the premises at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. For some reason, an argument arose between the refugee shelter's staff and the landlord. The language between eachother became discordant, so the landlord immediately ordered the refugees to evacuate the premises within four hours. Upon hearing the order, the refugees panicked, moving their belongings to the alleyway, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, and sitting on the ground. Among them were sick men and women, weeping bitterly, a pitiful sight. After the Red Cross learned of this, they negotiated with the landlord of 177 Avenue Edward VII, and the refugees were allowed to move back to the original location. The tenants who had leased the premises had not yet moved in, so this was possible. However, it was stipulated that they could only stay for four days. It is unknown where these refugees will move after four days. It is hoped that philanthropists will come forward to provide relief. It is heard that 93 Ren'an Lane is a newly built house, and the refugee shelter has already installed electric lights and paid the meter deposit, but the power has not yet been connected.</p>
<h3>Relief Society Continues to Receive Donations and Food Rice</h3>

It is learned that the society yesterday continued to receive 500 yuan in donations raised by Li Jindan on behalf of others, 200 yuan donated by the Shanghai Hotel Industry Association, and 20 shi of food rice donated by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society to assist refugees. On the 13th and 14th, the society registered a total of thirty-two refugees. Apart from sending three people back to Nanjing and one person back to Yangzhou, the rest were sent to the Dinghai Guild Hall, Furun Lane, Pujisi Temple, Yongqingsi Temple and other lodging places.</p>
<h3>Two More Detained Refugees Released</h3>
<p>Pan Jingfang, Yang Genquan</p>
<p>The Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Society previously reported that some refugees were being detained by the Japanese army. The society sent personnel to request their release from the Japanese consulate. Yesterday (the 15th) at noon, the Japanese consulate called the society to inform them that they would release Pan Jingfang and Yang Genquan. The society sent personnel to drive and pick them up, and then sent them home separately.</p>
<h3>Pants Crotch Opium Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiangsheng Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment</p>
<p>Liu Baosheng Six Months, Fined Two Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Zhang Xiangsheng of Nanxiang purchased a large package of opium, weighing dozens of taels, at Guo Yuanmao Shop, 14 Shengping Lane, French Concession, a few days ago and hid it in his crotch. He was visiting friends at Gaodi Lane, Zilaihuo Street, when he was stopped and searched by Detective Wang Maotou of French Concession Police No. 1, who saw Zhang walking unsteadily. A package of opium was found in his pants. When asked where he bought it, Zhang replied that it was from Guo Yuanmao, and the brand printed on the package was the same. Other detectives were immediately led to Guo Yuanmao Shop to search it. A large box containing thirty packages was found upstairs in the shop, matching the packaging paper found on Zhang Xiangsheng. Liu Baosheng, the shop's accountant, was also arrested and taken to the Second Special Court for investigation. Because the defendant's lawyer requested an extension of one week and asked for bail, Liu Baosheng was ordered to post 10,000 yuan in cash as special bail. The case was heard again a few days ago. Presiding Judge Li and Prosecutor Chen attended the hearing. First, the police lawyer stated the case, then the first defendant, Zhang Xiangsheng, was questioned about the circumstances of buying and being searched for the opium. Next, the second defendant, Liu Baosheng, the accountant of Guo Yuanmao, was questioned. Liu was defended by lawyer Wang Shizong, who stated that the defendant had been living in Zhabei and moved to this lane after the Shanghai Incident. When the police came to search the shop the other day, Liu was downstairs, while the opium was found upstairs, which had nothing to do with the defendant. Prosecutor Chen stood up and announced that the second defendant, Liu Baosheng, had committed two offenses in February and March of the 14th year of the Republic and was a habitual offender. Lawyer Wang replied that if Liu had indeed engaged in the same behavior, it had been more than five years according to Article 13 of the Opium Suppression Law. He also argued that the opium found on the first defendant and the opium copied from the shop were of the same style. The lawyer knew that the opium styles in Shanghai were roughly the same and requested the court to pay attention. The debate was immediately declared over, and the verdict was announced yesterday. Judge Li presided over the announcement. The first defendant, Zhang Xiangsheng, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for smuggling opium. The second defendant, Liu Baosheng, was found guilty of selling opium and sentenced to six months of imprisonment, with a fine of 2,000 yuan. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be reduced from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The opium was confiscated.</p>

<h3>Introducing Two Major Anti-Japanese Works</h3>
<p>At the request of the Xiandai Book Company, He Xiya is writing "A Record of Inspections in the Northeast" and "A History of the Anti-Japanese Bloody Battle in Shanghai." (1) The former book records the events on the eve of the Northeast Incident. At that time, the author traveled to the Northeast, conducted on-the-spot investigations, and recorded all his observations and experiences. It covers the complex relations and major issues between China, Japan, Russia, and Korea and can be regarded as the last contribution of the Chinese people to the investigation of the Northeast. (2) The latter book is a record of the recent one month and two-day anti-Japanese battle in Shanghai. The author personally experienced the front lines of the battlefield, witnessed events firsthand, widely sought Chinese and foreign news, and explored the underlying truths to write and compile it, removing falsehoods and preserving the truth. Therefore, it is comprehensive and detailed. Both books are now published, with a detailed map at the beginning of each volume, dozens of photographic images of the original events, and lengthy prefaces of over ten thousand words each by the authors, which is even more rare. As for the fluency of the writing and the faithfulness of the record, they are even more noteworthy. Both books contain credible and valuable historical materials and can be regarded as leaders in anti-Japanese works. He is happy to introduce them.</p>

It publishes a large sheet every day, and its main purpose is to seek the true needs of the people and guide the society in a correct direction.

<h3>Biased Views of Westerners</h3>
<p>Peier Focuses on Road Construction Beyond the Boundary</p>
<p>French Newspaper Echoes MacNaghten's Proposal</p>
<p>The Evening Star reported that at the first meeting of the new Board of Directors of the Public Concession yesterday, after Peier was elected as the Director-General, Peier made a brief statement to the press, saying that no one can see Shanghai degenerate after several months of turmoil, and no one wants to see the return of the bad state gained in the past five years due to political changes. The fruitless and unwholesome confrontation between the two police forces to compete for the management of roads outside the boundary must not be allowed to start again. Efforts should be made to persuade the Chinese authorities to negotiate in a friendly manner on matters that the Board of Directors is pressing for. The new Board of Directors will endeavor to support the recent proposal to demilitarize the Shanghai area. The appearance of large groups of Chinese troops on the edge of a peaceful business area, according to past events, often causes disturbances. All peaceful citizens do not want to see such events again.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that a French newspaper in Shanghai published an editorial yesterday, praising the proposal of MacNaghten, the outgoing Director-General of the Board of Directors, to organize an international court at the taxpayers' annual meeting. Although the public is very concerned about this issue, no personal comments were heard yesterday. The international court is actually one of the first steps in the plan for a free city of Shanghai, which has been advocated by various circles.</p>
<h3>Two Factories Destroyed by the Same Fire</h3>
<p>Jingyi Leather and Baoshan Paper Burned at the Same Time</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Wenlin's Twenty Years of Efforts Turn to Ashes</p>
<p>Shanghai Jingyi Leather Factory and Baoshan Paper Factory were established by industrialist Zhou Wenlin with collected funds. During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the two factories suffered heavy losses. A reporter recently met Mr. Zhou at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association and was told the details of the destruction of the two factories. According to Mr. Zhou, he founded the Jingyi Leather Factory in Gujiawan, Zhabei, in the second year of the Republic, manufacturing various kinds of leather by machinery. At first, due to insufficient capital, it was extremely difficult. Goods could not be sold until the third year of the Republic. At that time, the sole product was foreign goods. The Jingyi Factory paid attention to imitation and invented lake green sole leather, which was highly praised by all walks of life, saying that the products were not inferior to foreign goods, and the business gradually increased year by year. Later, because the location of Gujiawan was small and insufficient for use, a branch factory was established in Baziqiao in the thirteenth year of the Republic, covering more than twenty acres of land. The scale was roughly complete after years of construction. The monthly output could reach more than one hundred thousand pounds. I have been painstakingly running the factory for about twenty years, and only then did I finally feel slightly satisfied with my initial wish. Unexpectedly, the war suddenly broke out, and under the artillery fire, large and small factories in Zhabei were destroyed. My factory was uniquely destroyed after our troops retreated, which is especially heartbreaking. Since the outbreak of the war, until February 28, I personally went to see it several times and there was no loss. On March 1 and 2, I also sent people to inspect it, and it was still safe and sound. Unexpectedly, it was completely destroyed on the night of the 4th. The exact amount of the loss is estimated to be more than 800,000 yuan. In addition, the Baoshan Paper Factory, which is behind the Jingyi Branch Factory, was jointly established with paper engineer Zhang Renshou in the sixteenth year of the Republic. The paper produced was well received in the market. It was also reduced to ashes. The loss was no less than 200,000 yuan. My twenty years of effort were destroyed in one fell swoop. I can feel the pain, but for the sake of national sacrifice, I hope that our people will not forget this kind of brutality, unite as one, and seek resistance. Although I have been harmed, I am willing to do so.</p>
<h3>County Government District Chief Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held its 24th District Chief Meeting at 10 a.m. yesterday.

County Chief Yan Shenyu presided over the meeting, and Hu Gongshou recorded the minutes. The cases were discussed and resolved as follows: (1) The county chief submitted a proposal from the Provincial Defense Committee ordering the election of district defense chiefs in accordance with the law, and they should not be concurrently held by district chiefs. How should this be followed? It was resolved that each district should elect two people and report to the county for verification. (2) The Fifth District Chief proposed that it was difficult to implement the previously decided interest-free loan for relief, and could we continue to conduct price control as before. The decision was made to: A. Continue to carry out price control as before. B. The previous decision to handle interest-free loans for relief was cancelled.</p>
<h3>Henry Tailor Moves to New Location</h3>
<p>Henry Tailor, the first in Shanghai to rent men's and women's wedding dresses, has new styles of formal wear. The high convenience is widely praised by various fields. Due to the current situation, the original location on Xihua Road was inconvenient for business, so it was moved to 276 Jing'an Temple Road, opposite the racetrack, for business as usual.</p>
<h3>Bank Weekly Volume 15 Issue 12 Published</h3>
<p>Bank Weekly has never been missed since its founding in the sixth year of the Republic. During the Shanghai war, the newspaper's printing house happened to be in the war zone, which caused a slight delay. It has now returned to its original state, and the fifteenth volume, number twelve, was published yesterday. In addition to important papers, the main items include international news, domestic news, finance, market conditions, and balance sheets of various banks. The content is extremely substantial.</p>

It has moved into the new location at 514, 5th Floor, Mainland Commercial Plaza, Nanjing Road for business.</p>
<h3>Cruel Case of Daughter-in-Law Biting Mother-in-Law</h3>
<p>Yeh Chang's jealousy over her sister-in-law's three thousand yuan dowry</p>
<p>Old woman has six bite wounds on her lower legs</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Yeh Huang, a local resident, lives in a bungalow at the end of Kang Ji Lane, Kang Ti Road, in the French Concession. She is sixty years old and has two sons and one daughter. The family has ancestral properties worth around thirty to forty thousand yuan. The eldest son, A-Fu, is thirty-two years old and married to Chang (thirty-seven years old this year). The second son, Mao-Qing, is twenty-nine years old and married to Lu (twenty-nine years old this year). Both have children. The youngest daughter, Cui-Bao (nickname A-Liu), is twenty-seven years old this year and not yet engaged, awaiting marriage. However, the eldest daughter-in-law, Chang, is known to be fierce, nicknamed "She-Tiger." Matchmakers and neighbors are aware of her reputation, so the relationship between mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, and sisters-in-law is not harmonious. Mrs. Huang, being elderly, cannot withstand Chang's fierce abuse, so she lives with her second son in the old house. Chang and her husband, A-Fu, live separately nearby at No. 4, Lane 454, Kang Ti Road. The brothers each make a living and do not visit often. Cui-Bao works at the Mayer Silk Weaving Factory. Over the years, she met Chen Qiao, an accountant at the factory, and their friendship developed into love. They have been secretly dating for two years. Recently, the two parties decided to officially marry, with matchmakers and witnesses arranging the marriage. Cui-Bao also asked her mother for autonomy in marriage. With Mrs. Huang's permission, the wedding was set for the 10th of this month (i.e., the 6th day of the third month of the lunar calendar). Mrs. Huang was preparing the dowry, bridal clothes, and utensils, which were estimated to cost around one thousand yuan. Unexpectedly, Chang became jealous when she saw her mother-in-law preparing a large sum to marry off her daughter. On the 7th of this month, she went to the old house to extort a large sum from her mother-in-law, demanding three thousand yuan, saying, "You have money to marry off your daughter, so I also want three thousand yuan from you." Her demands were unreasonable, and Mrs. Huang sternly refused. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law started arguing, and people intervened to break it up. Chang went home resentfully, holding a grudge. That night, around 10 p.m., she sneaked back to the old house. Taking advantage of her mother-in-law and Cui-Bao sleeping soundly, she pried open the door and entered. She got on the bed and straddled Mrs. Huang without asking any questions. She used her mouth to bite her mother-in-law's lower body, both legs, and genitals. Mrs. Huang woke up in pain from her sleep. Being old and unable to resist, she was bitten six times, with skin and flesh torn off. Cui-Bao, fearing Chang's fierceness, got out of bed and hid. Mrs. Huang shouted for help, and her second daughter-in-law, Lu, and neighbors responded. Chang took the opportunity to escape. Later, Lu and Cui-Bao entered the room to check on Mrs. Huang. She was in extreme pain and had fainted. Inspecting the injuries on her lower body, they saw a bloody mess, too gruesome to bear. They immediately found a way to take her to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, Chang was still not satisfied. The next morning (the 8th), she learned that her brother-in-law, Mao-Qing, and his wife, and her sister-in-law, Cui-Bao, were accompanying Mrs. Huang at the hospital. She sneaked into the old house again and burned all forty-eight pieces of Cui-Bao's prepared dowry, including silk and cotton, lined and unlined bridal clothes (worth 486 yuan), in the courtyard. She also took all the gold, silver, and jewelry worth 351 yuan and fled to hide with Ah Gui-jie Yi Zhong. When Cui-Bao returned home and saw the scene, she was terrified by her sister-in-law's cruelty and her obstruction of the wedding. She was also heartbroken that her mother was injured because of her. She told her fiancé, and they went to the Lujiawan Central Police Station to request an investigation. The police chief, seeing Chang's barbarity, deemed it a serious violation of human ethics and sent detectives to arrest her. However, Chang was nowhere to be found and could not be arrested. They photographed the remaining ashes of the clothes and brought them back to the police station in a bamboo basket to report to the police chief. Chang, hiding outside, saw the severity of the situation. On the afternoon of the 14th, she sneaked back home and pretended to commit suicide by swallowing a gold ring. Detective Zhu Caichen learned of this and rushed to arrest her, taking her into custody at the police station. Yesterday afternoon, she was sent to the Second Special District Local Court for investigation. Judge Wang Gangxu, along with clerk Zhu Chengzhu, and prosecutor Wu Xiaoshu, presided over the interrogation in the First Criminal Court. First, police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, accusing her of violating Articles 294, 298, and 382 of the Criminal Code, including harming a senior relative and destroying property. He stated that the police procedures were not yet complete and requested a postponement for further investigation. He also presented the ashes of the clothes as evidence. The victim, Mrs. Yeh Huang, was escorted to the court by her second daughter-in-law, Lu, and daughter, Cui-Bao. Due to the severity of her injuries, she could not stand, so the court allowed her to sit during the hearing. Lawyer Yeh Fu-kang represented her and described the defendant's biting. When questioned, the defendant, Yeh Chang, denied biting her mother-in-law's body, claiming that her sister-in-law, Lu, and sister-in-law, Cui, had bitten her and falsely accused her. She hired a lawyer to defend her and requested bail during the postponement. The court, considering the seriousness of the case, denied the defendant's request for bail and adjourned the hearing.

<h3>Case of Prostitute Dying from Abortion</h3>
<p>Zheng Qingtang and others sentenced separately</p>
<p>Zheng Qingtang, from Hangzhou, and his wife, Zheng Shen, ran a brothel at No. 27 Guangxi Road. In December of last year, they bought a girl from Hangzhou named Shen Xianghong for 400 yuan with the intention of making her a prostitute. However, Shen was pregnant and could not receive guests. They asked Wu Xiubao, a woman from Hangzhou (nicknamed Lao Er), to introduce Wang Laoniang to perform an abortion on Shen. Due to the poor medical skills, Shen died from the abortion. Afterward, they prepared a coffin for Shen and claimed she died of illness, placing her coffin in the Shaoxing Guild Hall in the South City. Later, the Zhabei Police Station discovered this and arrested Zheng and his wife, as well as Wu Xiubao, and brought them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The court sent a letter to the local court to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that Shen died from the abortion. After the interrogation, the sentencing was scheduled for yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi and the defendant's lawyer, Yuan Yang-an, were present in court. Judge Qian Hongye announced the verdict: Zheng Qingtang, intending to profit, enticed a girl under the age of twenty and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The charge of performing an abortion was dismissed. Zheng Shen, intending to profit, enticed a girl under the age of twenty and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Intending to profit from an abortion, which resulted in the death of a woman, she was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and fined 300 yuan. The sentence was four years and six months, and the fine was 300 yuan. If the fine was not paid, it would be converted to one day of imprisonment for every two yuan. Wu Xiubao, intending to profit from an abortion, which resulted in the death of a woman, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The number of days each of the three individuals was detained before the final verdict was reached would be counted as two days of imprisonment for each day of detention.</p>

The other day, he was driving truck No. 16876 on Bai Li Nan Road and turned onto Yi Ding Pan Road. There were two people walking in the middle of the road on the south side of the road. He honked the horn, but they ignored him. As his truck turned, he had no choice but to steer north, which resulted in the accident. Liu Rongda testified that he and Jin Yaoting were sewing clothes in the No. 28 clothing store when the truck suddenly crashed into the store, destroying all the equipment. He was lucky to escape, but Yaoting was injured in the head and hands when the wall collapsed. Sun Jin's wife, Pang Manhe, also testified.

<h3>Liang Chengyu's Case Sent Back for Retrial</h3>
<p>Liang Chengyu, a Chinese detective from the No. 2 Inspectorate of the General Police Department, was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for allegedly robbing Fang Liansheng of morphine worth 50,000 yuan. The initial trial found Liang not guilty. The police department appealed to the High Court, and Liang was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. However, Liang also appealed to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the police department filed another lawsuit with the Special Court, alleging that Liang had kidnapped Chen Shifan, the owner of the Chen Lin Ji Construction Factory, on Pingwang Street on December 19 of the previous year, and Li Huiqing, a property owner, on Hubei Road on February 8 of the previous year. After investigation, Liang was sentenced to death, and the report was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. The Provincial Government considered there were still doubts about Liang's involvement in the kidnapping case, so it sent the case back to the Special Court for retrial. Yesterday afternoon, at 2 p.m., the further hearing was scheduled. The police department brought the accomplices and witnesses, including Fang Liansheng, and escorted Liang to the Second Criminal Court. Judge Wu Tingqi conducted the interrogation. The defendant Liang Chengyu's wife also attended the hearing and hired three lawyers, Zhan Jifeng, Yeh Fukan, and Yuan Yang-an, to defend him. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the court had ordered the police to summon the two kidnapped victims and the tea server from the Yadong Hotel. The police had sent detectives to summon them, but Li Huiqing was not in Shanghai, and Chen Shifan had been summoned but did not appear. The tea server from the Yadong Hotel could not be summoned because the hotel had changed owners and the tea server was no longer employed. Judge Wu stated that the case file was currently at the Supreme Court and had not yet been returned, so the trial could not proceed today. He ordered Liang to be returned to custody for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<h3>Trial Opens in Pudong Inheritance Murder Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang and Zhang Yuxiang, of Huayuan Stone Bridge, Pudong, were shot and killed by Zhang Qingxiang, the son of their stepmother Zhang Zhang, and their maternal uncle, Zhang Quansheng, over an inheritance dispute. Guoxiang was injured but not killed, while Yuxiang died. The Local Court arrested Zhang Zhang, Zhang Qingxiang, and Zhang Quansheng and filed a public prosecution after a thorough investigation.

The first wife, Zhang Qian, and her husband were both dead. She did not know how this tragedy occurred. However, Zhang Quansheng was a frequent visitor. Zhang Qingxiang had been doing business on Quansheng's small steamboat the year before. When asked if Zhang Yuxiang had contact with Zhang Quansheng, she replied that they were not on good terms and did not associate because she had helped Zhang Qian's wife with a lawsuit after her husband's death. Zhang Yunxiang stated that he was Zhang Linsen's youngest son and was studying business at a customs brokerage. He had been at home since the boycott of Japanese goods. On the night of the incident, he was called away by a friend to play football and was away from home all day. Later, he saw the police running around while reading a newspaper in a rice store and learned about the incident. He went to see Guoxiang first, but did not find his sister-in-law. He then went home and told his mother, who already knew. Soon after, Qingxiang returned, and the family was speechless. Zhao Chunfu stated that he was a partner in a shoe store in Huayuan Stone Bridge. He had only recently joined the partnership. He was called to testify today, but his boss asked him to come in his place. He knew nothing about the matter. Zhang Shangzhen stated that he was an employee of the Pudong Bank. It was true that Zhang Guoxiang and Zhang Qingxiang had argued when they mortgaged forms at the bank. Zhang Baoshi, the wife of Zhang Guoxiang and Zhang Yuxiang, hired a lawyer to appear in court and requested an additional private prosecution for over 5,000 yuan. The judge stated that the witnesses were not all present and adjourned the hearing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team Receives Telegram from Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>Circumstances of Feigned Compliance with the Japanese</p>
<p>The Japanese Manipulation of the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, the investigation team received a telegram from Ma Zhanshan,</p>
<p>The text was four to five thousand words long, recounting in detail his retreat to Hailun and subsequent feigned compliance with the Japanese. It also described the various oppressions and manipulations by the Japanese in creating the puppet state. The telegram included a daily diary starting from the day he retreated to Hailun until the present. It began by stating that when he retreated to Hailun, the Japanese military sent officials to implore Ma to return to the province, saying that if he agreed, the Japanese military would definitely not enter Heihe and that all matters would be under Ma's command. Ma resolutely returned to the province, only to find that after arriving, the situation changed drastically. The Japanese constantly monitored and oppressed him in various ways, and he realized he had fallen into their trap. Therefore, he had no choice but to feign cooperation in order to obtain various information. Now, he is reporting all Japanese conspiracies in detail to the investigation team for reference. One section describes how the Japanese military manipulated the puppet state, sending people to instruct Puyi that he must refuse the title of "Chief Executive" of the so-called "Manchukuo" before accepting it, otherwise he would face adverse consequences. He was closely monitored, and his words and actions were not given the slightest freedom. Puyi attempted suicide by poison three times, but each time he was discovered and rescued by the Japanese.

<h3>Soviet Union Denies Ma Zhanshan is in Russian Territory</h3>
<p>(Moscow) TASS has obtained a formal statement from the Soviet government denying the recent reports from various news agencies and press organizations that General Ma Zhanshan has fled to Blagoveshchensk and has had contact with the Soviet Union.

The rumors about General Ma's relationship with Soviet representatives are not only completely unfounded but also contain provocative elements. The official here now believes that the origin of these rumors is the same as the secret transport of munitions from Dalian by the Japanese to supply General Ma five months ago, which was then attributed to Soviet assistance.

<h3>Rumor Has it that Puyi Has Lost All Freedom</h3>
<p>Under Extremely Strict Japanese Surveillance</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Harbin said that Puyi is worse off than a prisoner of war. The power of the puppet "Executive Government" is entirely in the hands of the General Affairs Office, whose director is the Japanese Komai. His authority directly overrides the State Council and the Executive Government. Anyone who wishes to meet with Puyi must first provide their name, resume, and the reason and purpose of their visit in detail. Komai reviews the request, and if it is not approved, it is returned. If approved, a meeting is scheduled. During the meeting, four Japanese individuals stand beside Puyi, providing strict surveillance. If one of them raises a hand, the visitor must leave immediately, regardless of whether the conversation between the host and guest is finished. Otherwise, the guest will be rebuked, and the host will be spat upon. Outside Puyi's residence, there are soldiers all day long. Microphones are installed inside the house, and every move is known to outsiders. Puyi cannot even wash his face with tears. Zheng Chui, the Secretary-General of the puppet State Council, initially indicated that Manchukuo wanted to train a certain number of troops. After experiencing the sharp edge of a gun, he is now like a cicada in winter, unable to utter a word. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Italy Has No Intention of Withdrawing From the League of Nations</h3>
<p>But Hopes the League Will Work Harder</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 14th - Foreign rumors claim that Italy intends to withdraw from the League of Nations. Today, Italian officials firmly denied this, saying that the Italian government has absolutely no such intention at present. This rumor is likely due to a misunderstanding arising from a discussion at the Fascist Party Congress about reconsidering Italy's attitude toward the League of Nations Council in October. Foreign newspapers mistakenly interpreted this as meaning that Italy intended to withdraw from the League. It is not known that the Fascist Party has a resolution advocating that the League of Nations revise the peace treaty. It would be unreasonable to say that Italy would unilaterally demand revision of the peace treaty while preparing to withdraw from the League. In short, Italy believes that the League should be more active, especially because the League of Nations Council has shown very little determination and ability in handling major issues and maintaining its dignity. It hopes that it will have more effective activities in the future.</p>

<h3>Public Riot in New Zealand</h3>
<p>Queen Street Turns Into a Dark World</p>
<p>Shop Windows All Smashed</p>
<p>Naval Force Assists Police in Maintaining Order</p>
<p>Over Two Hundred Civilians Injured</p>
<p>Reuters, Auckland, 15th - Auckland, one of New Zealand's most important cities, experienced a violent riot today, necessitating the deployment of a naval force to assist the police in restoring order. During the riot, hundreds of civilians were injured, and twenty-three police officers were also injured. Property damage is estimated at no less than 100,000 pounds. The incident originated with a demonstration by civil service employees protesting an eleven percent pay cut. A large number of unemployed people also joined the demonstration, marching near the city hall. Police attempted to disperse them, and a conflict ensued. Bricks and other objects became weapons. Almost every shop window on the usually bustling Queen Street was smashed. Jewelry stores, clothing stores, and tobacco shops were particularly targeted by the rioters. Young men and women rushed into jewelry stores, scrambling to grab items. The chaos lasted for two hours. At night, the streets were dark because all the streetlights had been smashed. In the emergency, police drove fire engines out to suppress the rioters, but to no avail. The authorities urgently called for sailors from warships in the harbor to come ashore and temporarily organized a special police force. Many people have volunteered.</p>
<p>Reuters, Auckland, 15th - By midnight, when a large force of reinforcements, sailors, and citizens had gathered, the rioters had already scattered. It is now estimated that about forty people have been arrested, and over two hundred have been injured and admitted to hospitals.

The Royal Naval Reserve has been deployed for defense, and mounted volunteer patrols are patrolling the streets. Insurance premiums for glass windows have increased by fifty percent. Fire insurance premiums are a thousand times higher than usual, so it is impossible to insure.</p>
<h3>Reaction to German Government's Dissolution of Nazi Party Military Forces</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th - President Hindenburg's order to dissolve the military organization of the National Socialist Party has aroused the anger of party members in the Munich area.

Today, they held an election meeting, and the situation was very bad, but the chairman's strong encouragement to remain calm prevented trouble. Opinion in western Germany believes that the government's hostile actions towards the National Socialist Party may instead make people sympathize with Hitler. Although its semi-military organization has been dissolved on the surface, party members will secretly carry out more forceful actions. 克拉格, the Minister of the Interior and Police Chief of Brunswick, although a member of the National Socialist Party, is now complying with government orders and personally carrying out the dissolution of the party's military organization.</p>

Therefore, the 赤松 faction is urgently advancing the establishment of a new party, and the crisis of a split in the Social Democratic Party is imminent.</p>

<h3>Account of the League of Nations Investigation Team Arriving in Peiping</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Stay in Peiping for Seven or Ten Days</p>
<p>Focusing on Collecting Various Materials</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Tientsin on the morning of the 9th and took a special train to Peiping in the afternoon, arriving at the station at 6:10 p.m. On the morning of the 10th, they visited Zhang Xueliang. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangements for Welcome: Upon receiving the news on the 9th that the investigation team would arrive in Peiping that evening, various circles and groups here immediately hung flags to express their welcome. Various important thoroughfares also had pre-hung slogans. For example, the archways of West Chang'an Avenue, Tiananmen, and the entrance of the Beijing Hotel had white cloth banners two zhang long and two zhang wide, with Chinese characters at the top and English in neat font below. At the entrance of the Beijing Hotel, the banner read (Welcome the Impartial and Just League of Nations Investigation Team). The others read (The Chinese People Would Rather Die for Justice Than Submit to the Humiliation of Power), (The Chinese People Will Never Recognize Treaties Imposing National Humiliation Through Power), (The Chinese People Resist Japan to Uphold Justice), etc. The East Railway Station was newly painted, and a flower archway was erected outside the fence, with the word (Welcome) written above and (Welcome) in English below. The white cloth banner outside the station read (Welcome the League of Nations Investigation Team, Messengers of Peace), also in Chinese and English. The train stopped at the northernmost platform. A pine branch archway was erected at the platform gate, and a completely English white cloth welcome banner was hung outside the platform. After the special train stopped, the small electric lights were all lit, and the red and green colors reflected each other, making it bright and dazzling. Around 5:00 p.m., the area around West Chang'an Avenue gradually saw people from all walks of life wearing top hats and formal suits, or round-topped hats and Qing-style jackets with light red circular badges (entry permits) pinned to their lapels, rushing towards the Qianmen area. Small vendors in the Dongdan and Dong'anmen areas covered their tables with clean white foreign cloth, neatly and uniformly, a rare sight in Peiping. After 5:00 p.m., the station gate was closed to all but authorized personnel. There were about four or five hundred military and police officers, and three military bands. The two bands on the easternmost and westernmost sides were both from the Public Security Bureau, while the middle band of about forty people, in blue uniforms, yellow hats, and badges, was a naval band from Qingdao. When the special train entered the station, the band on the eastern end began to play. The welcoming personnel had their designated positions. The academic community was on the easternmost side, followed by civil groups, the press, representatives of various institutions, and then the receptionists and leaders of various institutions. The westernmost side was occupied by various embassies. Generally speaking, the more westward the position, the better, and the more important. Not many representatives from the academic community arrived, as all universities and schools had been on strike since the day before, a desolate scene. Most students and others maintained a silent attitude towards the arrival of the investigation team and did not express much. As a result, the eastern end appeared increasingly deserted, while the western end became more crowded. There were a total of five female representatives, one a tall young Western woman, one a plump Miss Xiong, and the others were unrecognizable. There were not many Westerners. There was one among the press, and four or five Japanese, also standing in the press.</p>
<p>Situation at the Station: At about 5:30 p.m., a train pulled into the eastern side of the south platform, seemingly to block the view from the south. At 5:55 p.m., a pilot train entered, and at 6:01 p.m., the military band played loudly and the special train arrived. The special train was dark green and newly built. The interior furnishings were exquisite, and the curtains were all purple. This train has been extremely rare since the transfer of Sun Yat-sen's remains. After the special train stopped, Zhang Xueliang, the Pacification Commissioner of Peiping, first boarded the train to express his welcome to the five committee members. He got off the train in less than ten minutes. The crowd removed their hats, and the military and police saluted. The investigation team then got off the train together, removing their hats to return the salute to the crowd. At this time, Zhang Xueliang had already returned to Prince Shuncheng's mansion by car. After the investigation team left the station, they also went to the Beijing Hotel by car. Lytton was accompanied by Gu Weijun, Mccoy by Diao Zuqian, Claude by Chen Renxian, Hiny by Wang Yintai, and 马列斯可特 by Tang Xin畲. Along the way, the military and police along the streets of the Public Security Bureau and East Chang'an Avenue saluted with their guns.</p>
<p>Gu Weijun's Remarks: Gu Weijun spoke to reporters at the Beijing Hotel at 7:01 p.m. that evening, saying that the investigation team had left Pukou seven days ago and traveled north, passing through Chuzhou, Mingguang, Bengbu, Xuzhou, and Taian. Representatives from all walks of life welcomed them along the way, and they were very pleased with the safe journey. The members of the investigation team praised the comfortable equipment of the special train of the Beining Railway and highly praised the development of China's transportation industry. Yesterday, they passed through Jinan and attended a banquet hosted by the provincial government, and visited Daming Lake. This morning, they arrived in Tianjin, first receiving the three most active gentlemen, and then receiving representatives from all walks of life: Zhang Boling, Hu Zhengzhi, Bian Baimei, and Wang Wendian. Lord Lytton was quite satisfied because the materials obtained were more detailed than those obtained in the South. Afterwards, he attended Chairman Wang's luncheon and left Tianjin at 3:00 p.m. to come to Peiping. They will stay in Peiping for seven or ten days. He hoped that all circles would reduce banquets and give them time to collect materials. Lord Lytton and others are tired from the journey and plan to rest for a day or two before meeting with people from all walks of life separately. Whether they will go to the Northeast for investigation and compile a report in Beidaihe is still undecided. A simple report will be prepared for the League of Nations General Assembly on May 1. As for the refusal of the puppet state to allow me to enter the pass, I asked Foreign Minister Luo, who said that he had not seen any notification from the puppet state. If such a notification arrives in Peiping, we will definitely not accept it.</p>
<p>Prescribed Intoxication: During the investigation team's stay in Peiping, they must focus on collecting various materials. They have declined invitations to banquets from all walks of life in Peiping, except for the tea party hosted by the third wife of Consultant Zhang and the banquet hosted by Director Zhang. The time for visiting scenic spots will also be determined at any time. The times and locations of the two banquets are as follows: From 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on April 10, the third wife of Director Zhang, the wife of Representative Gu, and the wife of Mayor Zhou will host a tea party at the Yingbin Hotel. At 8:30 p.m. on April 11, Director Zhang, the Pacification Commissioner, will host a banquet at Jurentang.</p>
<p>Visiting Zhang Xueliang: The chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team, Sir Lytton, and members General McCoy, General Claude, Dr. Hiny, and Count Macoti, accompanied by Gu Weijun, Tang Xin畲, Wang Yintai, Diao Zuqian, and others, went to Prince Shuncheng's Mansion to visit the Pacification Commissioner of Peiping, Zhang Xueliang. Lytton and McCoy's cars went first, arriving at Prince Shuncheng's Mansion at 10:01 a.m. Zhang personally came out to welcome them and accompanied them into the main reception hall. After a brief exchange of greetings, Hiny and Macoti also arrived and began the meeting. Only Gu Weijun was present to accompany them. Claude arrived at Prince Shuncheng's Mansion after 10:30 a.m. because he had gone to the French Embassy and joined the conversation. Lytton asked Zhang many questions about the situation in the Northeast, and Zhang answered each one in detail. The conversation lasted for an hour, and Lytton and the other four left the mansion at about 11:00 a.m. and returned to the Beijing Hotel for lunch. Director Zhang also went to the Beijing Hotel by car at 5:00 p.m. to return the visit and met for forty minutes. At 5:45 p.m., Zhang, accompanied by Lytton and the other five committee members and Gu Weijun, went to the Yingbin Hotel by car to attend the tea party hosted by the three wives of Zhang, Gu, and Zhou. Also, Japanese representative Yoshida Isaburo visited Director Zhang at Prince Gu's Mansion at 2:00 p.m. and left at 2:30 p.m. According to Gu Weijun, the team believed that former officials of the Northeast, many of whom are now in Peiping, were necessary for future reference in the investigation of the Northeast, and it was necessary to exchange views with each other. It was decided to hold a longer meeting together, with a larger number of participants, to hold a discussion. However, the date of the meeting will depend on the situation and has been agreed upon within the next two days.</p>
<p>Tea Party Hosted by the Three Wives: Zhang Xueliang's wife, Ms. Yu Fengzhi, Gu Weijun's wife, Ms. Huang Conglan, and Zhou Dawen's wife, Ms. Gao Yuezhu, hosted the League of Nations Investigation Team at the Diplomatic Building from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on the 10th, and invited the wives of important figures from the military, political, and academic circles of Peiping to attend. People arrived one after another after 4:00 p.m., including Xiong Xiling, Yu Xuezhong, Rong Zhen, Chen 𧃆, Wang Zheng黼𣀅, Xia Yiting, Zhang Xueming, Xu Shuxi, Ding Wenjiang, Zeng Guang勷, Luo Jialun, Mei Yiqi, Yuan Tongli, Chen Shiquan, Chen Fangxian, Cao 浤, Chen Renxian, Dai Chunlin, Diao Zuqian, Wang Yintai, Jiang Chaozong, Shen Nengyi, Ning Xiangnan, Shen Zutong, and others. The embassies that were invited to attend included the German Minister Todtmann, the American Counselor Barke, the Belgian Chargé d'affaires Garev, and all the staff of other embassies, totaling over three hundred people. The three wives all wore Chinese-style long robes, Zhang's wife in yellow, Gu's wife in pink, and Zhou's wife in white with black flowers. They were very busy going back and forth to entertain the guests. At 6:00 p.m., Lytton, Claude, McCoy, Hiny, and Macoti, led by Gu Weijun, first went to the main reception hall to be introduced to the three wives. Then Director Zhang also entered the reception hall with Zhu Guangmu, Zhou Dawen, and others to meet with Lytton and others, and they went together to another large hall to hold a tea party. Champagne and various pastries were prepared, and the arrangement was very clean. The guests and hosts talked happily. During the meeting, Zhang also introduced Rong Zhen to talk with Lytton. Rong was in Shenyang at the beginning of the Northeast Incident, so Lytton asked Rong about the details of the incident in great detail, and Rong answered truthfully. Lytton expressed satisfaction. At 6:55 p.m., Lytton and the other four resigned, and the other participants also left one after another (April 11).</p>
<h3>League of Nations Dissatisfied With Japan</h3>
<p>Recognizes Japan's Proposal to Withdraw Troops From Shanghai as a Pretext</p>
<p>Nineteen-Nation Committee Will Have Fierce Debate</p>
<p>Refusal to Let Gu and Manchuria Enter May Worsen Feelings Towards Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, Geneva Dispatch: The League of Nations is about to continue its meeting, and the important events are the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Danube River relief issue, and the international labor issue. Representatives from various countries are now gathering in Geneva one after another. British representative Foreign Secretary Simon arrived here by plane on the 11th. Among them, the most noteworthy Sino-Japanese incident is expected to cause a fierce debate after the opening of the Nineteen-Nation Committee. On the one hand, regarding the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference, the League's intention is that the Japanese army's withdrawal period is vague, and it is believed that new conditions for the protection of the lives and property of the residents in Shanghai and legitimate business are needed. It is recognized as an infinite pretext, so the Chinese representative 顔必will propose a clear date for the withdrawal of troops and put spiritual pressure on it. In order to deal with the meeting, our government has telegraphed Ambassador to France Nagaoka Shunei to attend as a representative. Although the Council is currently discussing European financial issues and has not yet discussed the Shanghai incident, the statement refusing Gu Weijun to enter Manchuria and Lord Lytton is feared that the League Committee's feelings towards Japan will become more and more惡化. Moreover, the atmosphere of various parties' evaluations of Japan's proposal is very unfavorable, Yunqu.</p>
<h3>Investigation Group's Report on the Situation from Beijing to the West (5)</h3>
<p>Appendix: League of Nations' Handling of the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>B. Proceedings of the Third Meeting of the Administrative Council</p>
<p>(1) The Conference on November 16th and the Situation After the Meeting. That day's public meeting was merely a diplomatic formality. Aside from the chairman's explanation of the reasons, no debate took place. Therefore, all negotiations were conducted through secret meetings, which were held almost daily.</p>
<p>At the time, our country still insisted on our consistent stance: withdraw troops first, then negotiate. Japan, on the other hand, insisted that we recognize its so-called Five Basic Principles. As for the attitude of Britain and France, they were completely observing the situation. Britain and France believed that the United States, as a Pacific nation, had more interests in China than they did, and had a very strong navy and solid economy as a backing. They felt the US should adopt a firm and clear attitude toward Japan. However, the United States believed that since the Sino-Japanese dispute was being handled by the League of Nations, the League should bear full responsibility for resolving it. The United States could only assist from the side. Britain and France wanted the United States to first express an attitude of alliance with the League of Nations, while the United States wanted to see how the League acted before considering a long-term, independent cooperation with the League.</p>
<p>After U.S. representative General Dawes arrived in Paris, he still maintained the dignity of a Vice President and remained reserved. French Foreign Minister Briand, as the chairman of the Administrative Council and host, felt it inappropriate to visit first. Therefore, after several days of Administrative Council meetings, no progress was made, while in northern Manchuria, the Japanese army was already engaged in a fierce battle with General Ma Zhanshan on both sides of the Nen River.</p>
<p>When the news of the fall of Qiqihar arrived, it was said that Japan had dropped a bomb on the seats of the Administrative Council. General Dawes also visited Briand to discuss countermeasures. The atmosphere became tense for a time. The U.S. Secretary of State made a strict inquiry to the Japanese ambassador to the U.S. At the same time, the Administrative Council's Twelve Committee discussed the application of Articles 15 and 16. However, the powerful</p>
<p>The effectiveness of Articles 15 and 16 in sanctioning aggressive actions was lengthy, so they could not be put forward.</p>
<p>Shenyang, Jilin, and Qiqihar are the three major cities of our country's Eastern Provinces. Now that they have been successively occupied, Japan's dream of ruling Manchuria has come true. In order to appease the powers, Japan changed its strategy and declared to the Administrative Council that the Five Basic Principles could be left for direct negotiation between the Chinese and Japanese governments later. There was no need to force China to recognize them in the Administrative Council now. As for sending an investigation team, the Japanese government could now accept it.</p>
<p>(2) The Situation After the Conference on November 21st. At the meeting that day, the Japanese representative formally proposed sending an investigation team and asked for everyone's support. However, he stated that the scope of the investigation was not limited to Manchuria, but also included the anti-Japanese movement in mainland China. Our country's representative, seeing through the cunning of Japan's policy, replied that the most important thing now was to order the Japanese army to cease military action and withdraw to within the South Manchurian Railway zone. If this point were relaxed and other matters were used as conditions for exchange, the Chinese government could not accept it. As for sending an investigation team, it was a proposal made by China several months ago and could naturally be supported. However, the authority of the investigation team would be considered when the Japanese representative formally submitted concrete measures. However, China only insisted on a scheduled troop withdrawal, and Japan had managed to get the United States to oppose this proposal. The reason was that there were bandits everywhere in the Eastern Provinces, and it was not appropriate to demand the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops to endanger the lives and property of foreigners. Britain and France also echoed this, and our country's proposal for a scheduled troop withdrawal was implicitly rejected by the powers. At this point in the meeting, Briand asked the Japanese representative to put forward concrete measures regarding the organization of the investigation team as a basis for discussion at the next meeting, and earnestly declared to the Japanese representative that there should be absolutely no further military action during the investigation team's work. When Briand spoke, he revealed a feeling of infinite sorrow, and said that in this turbulent time, the brilliant and upright destiny of the League of Nations was in his hands, so he dared not but act with reverence to preserve it for a long time. He said, "If you representatives can cooperate with me to resolve the current difficulties, then my joy cannot be expressed. The more dangerous the international situation, the more bystanders criticize and even satirize us. Therefore, we will work harder, and the faith of the world's peoples in the League of Nations will be firmer. If you do not believe me, please look at the mountains of telegrams from all over the world that the chairman has received in recent days, expressing their faith and hope in us. This proves the greatness of the spiritual power of the League of Nations. How can we allow people to destroy this power and destroy the hope for the future of mankind, and become sinners for the world?" Briand cherished the League of Nations as if protecting an infant, but the complexity of world politics made Briand unable to find a solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is very regrettable.

<h3>U.S. Plans to Maintain Silver Prices, Marked Gold Falls Sharply by Over Five Taels</h3>
<p>Preparing for swaps, the bearish side posts three to four taels. The gold market situation is quite flat, trending toward sluggishness, fluctuating throughout the day around 720 taels, with a range of only a little over five taels. It initially fell, due to a slight drop in the silver market and the report of the U.S. plan to maintain silver prices. Later, there was news from foreign wires that Germany was buying ten million ounces of silver bars. Moreover, large accounts were selling heavily, likely due to both official and unofficial exchange rates easing. Thus, market sentiment was weak, and prices suddenly broke into the 720 tael range. Then, with more buyers appearing, short positions were slightly covered, and the market suddenly turned calm. Later trading was scattered, with prices slightly lower, ultimately falling by five taels, a reversal after several days of gains. However, brokers had already started swap trades a day earlier, initially at three to four taels, then reduced to 2.56 taels, and then back to four taels, all posted by the bearish side. This was due to the scarcity of spot goods, leading to manipulation by the bullish side. Opening down 3.2 taels.</p>
<p>Opening in the morning, the May contract immediately fell 3.2 taels to 720 taels. Large silver bars also fell by one-eighth, and silver prices followed suit. Reports from the floor indicated that the U.S. intended to maintain silver prices, complicating the market. Private cables showed a rise of one-sixteenth, leading to lower gold prices. Small accounts made slight purchases, adding about five qian. Later, large accounts sold aggressively, such as Zhi Feng, Yong Yi Feng, Yong Yuan Xing, Yong Tong, Tai Chang, and speculator Mr. Wu, immediately causing a drop of over four taels. The British gold initially saw HSBC absorbing spot contracts at 87.75, then recent contracts traded at 93.75, until the foreign exchange rate was announced at 15.8 taels. With both British and American exchange rates rising by 1.25, they continued to rise, as Yu He, Tong Tai Chang, Zhi Feng, and Yong Fu entered the market, and Fu Yu, Fu Chang, and others showed persistent buying interest, gradually increasing by over four taels, reaching 20.05 taels by 10:30 a.m., with only a bit over one tael of range trading. Afterward, it softened slightly, as Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Nei Xing Yi Feng Yong, and others exited. However, the exchange market was still flat, so it fell by over three taels to 16.7 taels by 11:30 a.m., still only fluctuating by a bit over one tael in an hour. Later, Zhi Feng Yong, Wu Pin Yu He, Hong Kang Yong, and others made slight purchases, adding three taels, reaching 19.7 taels at noon. The closing price was 19.5 taels, with the benchmark adjusted to 770 taels, a decrease of 60 taels to 57.8 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon trading turns scattered. In the afternoon market, it opened at 18.8 taels, with Da De Cheng, Yu He, and others making slight purchases. Swap trading had already started on the floor, as the bullish side was unwilling to easily exit, pushing it up to 4.45 taels, causing the market price to rise to 21.2 taels. Later, retail accounts mostly sold out their swaps, reducing it to around 2.5 taels. Hong Kang Yong and others sold, reaching 17.8 taels by 2:30 p.m. Shortly after, it was again pushed up to 4 taels, due to a prevalence of short positions, making it difficult to unwind smoothly. By 3:00 p.m., the market price increased to 20 taels, but market sentiment was weak, especially with the continued easing of exchange rates, with U.S. dollars readily available for purchase and sale at 43.75. Thus, the closing price was 18 taels, a decrease of 5.2 taels compared to the previous day. The total daily range, from the maximum of 21.2 taels to the minimum of 15.8 taels, was 5.4 taels. The benchmark was reduced by 56.7 taels, and ultimately 60 taels. Book entries ranged from 14 to 20 taels, with a makeup of 14 taels in the morning and 12 taels in the afternoon. The red bar increased by 5.25 taels.</p>
<p>Swap trades were not numerous. According to trading statistics on the floor, Fu Chang, Fu Yu, Qian Chang Xiang, Yu He, Fu Tai Heng, and Da De Cheng were all buyers. Zhi Feng Yong sold the most, about 1,000 bars. Shun Li, Yuan Mao Yong, and Mr. Wu were all sellers. Tong Tai Chang, Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Tai, and others sold and then bought. In the afternoon, Da De Cheng, Yuan Kang Xiang, and Yu He were all buyers. Shun Li and Hong Kang Yong were sellers. Other firms had already done swap trades, so there were few buyers and sellers.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Turns Easier</h3>
<p>But no major changes:: Most merchants are divesting</p>
<p>Yesterday, British and American exchange rates both reported declines, causing HSBC to extend its license by half a point, with British gold at 1 shilling 7 pence 6.25, American dollars at 31.0875 yuan, Hong Kong adding 2.5 points to 76 taels, Indian exchange adding half a yuan, German exchange adding 0.75, French francs lengthening by 5 yuan, Dutch guilders adding 2.5 points, Singapore dollars deducting 2 taels. The bank's trading prices are also trending easier, but there are no major changes throughout the day. The gold market nearly broke 720 taels. Compared to the previous day, British gold was slightly longer by 0.0625, American dollars longer by 0.1875. Trading among Chinese merchants was limited, with most divesting. About 45,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and Bombay received electricity for June purchases in the afternoon. Approximately 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of American dollars were traded, with some returning to gold. British Exchange.</p>
<p>Internal trading did not exceed 0.125 rises for several days. Seemed to be squeezing halves, from an early selling price of 1 shilling 7 pence 8.125 to 87.75, a buying price of 1 shilling 7 pence 87.75 to 93.75. HSBC first absorbed the spot price of 1 shilling 7 pence 87.75 (sold by the Dalian gang). Shanghai and Pan Gen entered June at 1 shilling 7 pence 93.75 (sold by Yi Feng Yong). Mitsui entered July at the same price. Hua Bi and Zheng Jin did five months together, and China Bank and Zhejiang did April together. Zheng Jin also sold HSBC in July at 1 shilling 7 pence 93.75.

<p>Internal trading was only 1.25 apart in one day, with April dropping 3.125 from July. The recent term is still tight. From an early selling price of 31.25 yuan in April, 31.3125 yuan in May, 31.4375 yuan in June, 31.5625 yuan in July. The buying price was increased by 1.25. Mitsui entered July at 31.625 yuan.

There was also a listing of one yuan, which equals silver at 3.23881 taels.</p>
<h3>Large Silver Bars Rebound 1.875</h3>
<p>According to a report from the National News Agency in London on the 15th, the London market for large silver bars closed higher today, with the recent term at 16 pence 6.875 and the distant term at 16 pence 7.5, both rising by 1.875 compared to yesterday. Another report: at 2 p.m. today, the London-New York exchange rate opened at 3 dollars and 77 cents.</p>
<h3>Hesitant Situation That Neither Advances Nor Retreats</h3>
<p>Silver supply has been easing: Copper coins see new increased prices.</p>
<p>In the past two days, the form of foreign copper coins has shown slight recovery; however, observing this afternoon's situation, there is still no sign of making a strong advance. With such a state of affairs, one that neither advances nor retreats, the sluggish mood of the copper coin market will likely not be dispelled any time soon. The morning market was at 7 qian 03 li 7 hao and a half, while the afternoon market was at 23 li 6 hao and 2 hu and a half; the end result being that compared to the afternoon market on the previous day, conditions had improved by 6 hao and 2 hu and a half. The amount of funds transferred by drafts in the morning market was 321,000 and in banknotes 40,000, while in the afternoon market it was 68 taels in drafts and 20,000 in banknotes. Banks bought and sold a combined total of 850,000 in the two markets, with the majority being purchases. Tea merchants also had a volume of several hundred thousand taels. The silver call loan rate for the morning and afternoon markets remained at 1 qian 5 fen, while the markup initially began at 2 qian but by the end of the session was only at 7 or 8 fen, which shows that the silver supply has been trending towards easing. The volume of traded discounted bills across the two markets totaled more than 2.1 million, with transactions between various banks and foreign firms totaling more than 900,000. Silver funds deposited included more than 2.5 million from Chinese merchants, more than 300,000 from customs duties revenue, more than 3.1 million in various funds deposited from foreign merchants, more than 800,000 in exchange deposits, more than 500,000 in goods deposits, more than 400,000 in transactions among small money shops, and more than 4.1 million received in silver coin public deposits by money shops, with more than 29 million received in silver public deposits. As for the supplementary coin market situation, there were no transactions in either of the two markets for Jiangnan small foreign coins, so the market price remained as it was at 6 qian 1 fen. For Guangdong small foreign coins, the morning market was at 6 qian 1 fen 3 li, while the afternoon market was at 2 li 6 hao and 2 hu and a half; 130,000 jiao were traded between the morning and afternoon markets, and the state of affairs was also easing. The only exception was copper coins, where due to the difference between supply and demand, the large board boldly increased the price by 4,000 wen to 417,000 wen, creating new increased prices not seen since trading began, with more than 34,000 strings traded.</p>
<h3>Undisclosed Trading in Securities and Bonds Rises by Another Half Yuan</h3>
<p>There were still settlement transactions in Chinese merchant securities yesterday, but only for 10,000 yuan for the compilation and 5,000 yuan for repatriation, and nothing more; as for the undisclosed trading prices, due to the stability of the situation and good market confidence, there was quite a lot of activity, so it continued to strengthen compared to the previous day, improving by approximately half a yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Sales Show Little Sign of Improvement</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is very weak, with the downtrend not yet stabilized, generating feelings of being increasingly hopeless. Due to sluggish actual sales, a depressed situation, and difficulty in circulating finances, commerce has stagnated along all routes, leading to a decline in market confidence and making it very difficult for the market to develop. The amount of yarn held by various factories is steadily increasing, making it even more difficult to stabilize market prices, hence, a more weaving downturn. Fine yarn forms are especially soft. In short, with the current situation far from stability, there is little hope for improvement in yarn sales. Investigations show that all gangs combined bought only 310 bales yesterday, with the market falling by approximately 5 qian. Among the customer gangs, 61 bales went to inland areas, 105 bales to Sichuan, 65 bales to Shantou, 20 bales to the Northern gang, 10 bales to Xiamen, 5 bales to Jiangxi, and 60 bales to fellow merchants.</p>
<h3>Shen Xin Continuously Purchases Local Cotton in Swap Deals</h3>
<p>The cotton market remained stable, as the trend of native cotton turned bullish, Indian cotton reversed and rose, and gold prices remained strong, leading to a sense of market confidence. However, with setbacks in the yarn market and yarn prices gradually decreasing, manufacturers are generally adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Shen Xin factory, however, settled quite a few Indian and American cottons. As headlining was scarce, they purchased native cotton in swap deals, leading to unusually active procurement and continuous daily purchases. The other factories took very little action. The sales board is recorded below:</p>
<p>Tianjin Cotton 34.50, 250 pieces bought by Shen Xin, actual goods sent to the factory.</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 33.50, 1,000 bales bought by Shen Xin, actual goods delivered to the warehouse.</p>
<p>Sub-Lingbao 39.50, 1,000 pieces bought by Shen Xin, actual goods sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>Survey of Cotton Stock in Local Warehouses for the Last Three Months</h3>
<p>Cotton stock in local warehouses has declined month by month since the outbreak of war, as sources from various routes were dwindling; however, recently, as traffic has gradually become smoother, some activity might be seen.

<h3>American Cotton Good at Twelve Pounds Sound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, then weak due to the downturn on Wall Street, and finally rose again due to strong actual sales. Futures rose 10 to 12 pounds sound, and spot goods rose 15 pounds sound. British cotton futures fell 6 to 8 points, and spot goods did not move. Egyptian cotton spot goods did not move. Indian cotton was firm due to short covering and speculative buying. Pingguoer rose 5.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose 4.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram dated 14th):</p>

<h3>Grain: The Rice Market in the Huangpu River Turns Active</h3>
<p>South Huangpu: Yesterday's sources came from approximately 30 firms. Transactions on this street, owing to fine weather, turned firm; top-grade Northern japonica rice increased by another jiao. The arrival of Zhongguan white japonica rice was also scarce. Customer gangs and those on this street became even more active, and the market price increased by several fen. Foreign long-grain rice and customer long-grain rice arrived in a flood and sales were sluggish, falling back by half a jiao. Fermented rice for two yuan alcohol households remained unchanged. Market conditions were downstream.</p>
<p>North Market: Yesterday's sources were not numerous. Retailers and dealers in towns and villages are still keen on selecting the top grades; rice from Wuxi and Kunshan in the customer gang sector has firmed up by 2 jiao. Foreign long-grain rice is scarce, with less availability. Stacking is available, with the market presenting a stabilized situation; an early, slightly lighter stock sold smoothly, so the trend called for an increase of 5 fen. The Northern gang's fermented rice for one yuan did neither well nor poorly. Shipping goods from the Lower River were opening with 5,000 shi.</p>
<h3>The Surge in Foreign Rice Becomes More Intense</h3>
<p>Spot Rice Suddenly Increases by Three Jiao: Futures Jump Up by One Qian Two</p>
<p>Intense Demand for Supply to the Interior of the Yangtze River: Total of 20,000 Bags Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday's conditions for foreign rice became increasingly active. Besides military needs, the demand from real-sales gangs increased sharply. The Han River along the Yangtze River route has been short of grain since last year's floods. Recently, local markets have gradually recovered, with a strong demand for rice. In addition to the amount handled by Hunan and Jiangxi, it is still insufficient for sales; so, there has been a great deal of purchasing in the market in recent days. Besides this, various places along the route north of the river and Zhenjiang Nanjing have all come to Shanghai to purchase. The demand from various regions of Jiangzhe inland and rural villages of this street is also intense. As the production area has a poor harvest and the back route cannot keep up, market confidence is high; hoarding and inquiring has occurred, and the market immediately presents a prosperous scene. Yesterday, approximately 20,000 bags were opened, including 5,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice at a price of 11.3 to 11.25 yuan; 300 bags of Jia japonica rice at 11.27 yuan; 15,000 bags of small twisted rice at a price of 10.02 to 10.15 yuan; and average to second-rate grade rice at 10 to 9.9 yuan, an increase of 2 to 3 jiao compared to the previous day. Futures for the May returned goods were 500 tons, with prices at 4 taels 8 qian 5 fen to 7 fen, a larger increase of 1 qian 2 fen from the previous market.</p>
<h3>Gradual Increase in Northern Demand for Flour Prices Jump Unceasingly</h3>
<p>The flour market presented a scene of further sharp increases yesterday, as the reserves along various routes were not abundant. With spring coming to an end and sales becoming active, Northern demand is gradually increasing. In addition, the quoted prices for foreign wheat are becoming better and the exchange rate is low, removing the ability to control the high prices of flour. (It was previously reported that the Russian side was handling flour shipments to Vladivostok, and current thorough investigations confirm that these shipments were disaster relief flour, approximately 500,000 bags, and had already been exported on the previous and current days). The factories, having already settled standard prices, are naturally happy to call out higher prices during this turnaround. (Reportedly, the factory price for the end of April has already been approved by the customer gangs, opening at 2 taels 1 qian 5 fen 2 li and a half). Therefore, the sentiment is particularly good, with prices for April opening 1 fen higher than the previous day, and then gradually increasing and even reaching a net of 2 taels 1 qian 2 fen and a half, an increase of 2 fen and 2 li and a half. For May, due to the excitement of the market, the opening price was high by approximately 2 fen, and then reached 2 taels 1 qian 5 fen 2 li and a half, an increase of 3 fen. As for the shipyard, yesterday they called out 2 taels 1 qian 5 fen deducting commissions, with both domestic and foreign sales as tight, the following steps are still expected to continue to improve.</p>
<h3>Shipment of Over 3,000 Bags of Foreign Wheat Reported for Export</h3>
<p>There has been little news from the wheat market for a long time. Yesterday, it was heard that the factory was willing to pay 4 taels 1 qian 5 fen for the foreign wheat in storage, while the traders were offering a fixed price of 4 taels 2 qian, so there were no transactions. However, according to reports from the export industry, over 3,000 bags of foreign wheat were loaded for export yesterday, with the location not yet detailed. If this is confirmed, the following steps are also expected to be noble.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Vegetables: Orchid Bamboo Branches High-Quality Goods Are Uniquely Scarce</h3>
<p>Recent deliveries of orchid bamboo branches have been lacking, with most of the stock available on the market being medium to second-rate quality. High-quality goods are uniquely scarce, so only a small amount has been opened in recent days. Market prices are no higher than 40 taels, largely because the goods are mixed and have broken shells, mold, and moth damage, making it extremely difficult to get a good price. Sales are also sluggish. It is also reported that in the Guangdong production areas, the flower seedlings are still good, so if they are properly processed, the new goods for this season can be expected to have a bountiful harvest.</p>
<h3>Shirting, Blue Striped Cloth, and Bleached Cloth Fall Again</h3>
<p>The trends for cotton cloth from our factory have been very weak in recent days, with demand from various gangs light. Military purchases have also come to a halt, so all prices have seen a downturn starting yesterday. Observing the following steps, it will likely be difficult to turn the situation around for a time. Yesterday, 11-pound coarse cloth saw a small face again. Cao Niu and Ren Jing sold for 4 taels 6 qian and a half, San Tu and San Mao for 4 taels 7 qian. 9-pound cloth bought by the Ningbo gang, Cat Eagle, 50 pieces, priced at 4 taels 3 qian 7 fen and a half, San Ji 4 taels 2 qian 7 fen and a half. The Double Ying and Five Crane brand cloth contracted for by the organization is still out of stock. It has not been fully delivered since it was thrown over to military purchases. Hubei coarse cloth is still strong. Lu characters opened at 8 taels 3 qian, and Tian characters at 8 taels 1 qian and a half. Coarse twill is more active than before. 14-pound Ren Ta 6 taels 1 qian and a half, 12-pound San Yu 5 taels 2 qian and a half. 40 to 50 pieces were traded yesterday. Blue striped cloth and bleached cloth fell again. Shusheng Tu 8 taels 3 qian, and Wu Fu 8 taels 6 qian. Fine cloth and fine twill are also softer than before.</p>

<h3>Chess Game</h3>
<p>— ·Wang·Xi·Shen·</p>
<p>Neither peace nor war, a hesitant stance. The center of the chess game is even worse. What is the unpredictable bamboo planned in your chest? Empty flowers reflected in your eyes, enough to be open-minded. The round table meeting opens with people as meat on the chopping block. The country has a square city, and I am a fish. Overturned pottery, the three capitals of Pingzi Fu. If there is nowhere for safety, seek Huaxu.</p>
<p>Ten days of light cold, one day of sunshine. The small building is busy killing the sound of flower vendors. The neon clothes are blown around in three thousand formations. The pavilions and towers are obscured by the clouds of twelve cities. The eyes are filled with the filth of spring, proudly ruling the maritime state. The heart is startled by the fragrant sequence passing Qingming. Most seductive is the corner east of the wall. Butterfly messengers and bee matchmakers have boundless affection.</p>
<h3>A Daily Newspaper Reporter's Awakened Words and Hatred of Heaven</h3>
<p>At the time of the January 28th Incident, Admiral Nomura, the Japanese naval commander stationed in Shanghai, emboldened by the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, held no respect for China in his mind. Therefore, even after obtaining complete acceptance of the Four Conditions from various parties, he was still not satisfied, but was determined to occupy Shanghai and then be happy, saying that the Japanese army could sweep away the Chinese troops in Shanghai in just four hours. Who would have thought that since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, reinforcements had been added more than ten times, and the commander had been changed four times, yet the stalemate continued for more than a month. Our troops had no reinforcements, and Liuhe was attacked, and only then did the entire army retreat. Has the Japanese military's continental dream been realized? When the battle of Shanghai broke out, the Japanese army was repeatedly defeated. A certain reporter for a Japanese newspaper once said that today's China is not the China of the Sino-Japanese War, and the 19th Route Army is not comparable to the dragon flag and braid-wearing troops of the past. The Chinese people have already awakened, and are no longer ignorant of patriotism as they were in the past. The fact that the people of Shanghai fully provided the 19th Route Army with material and spiritual assistance is clear evidence of this awakening. This statement is indeed true, and it is not only the people of Shanghai who can passionately love their country. When Li Xiangrong sings in the capital,</p>
<p>Every time she goes on stage, she first makes a brief speech, urging people to love their country, and then sings an excerpt from an anti-Japanese Peking Opera that she wrote herself, to inspire the audience. (It is quite generous and moving, but the lyrics are omitted due to space constraints.) Xiangrong is just a small woman who sells songs, yet she knows how to love her country. It can be seen that our people across the country are no longer soundly asleep as they were during the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<h3>The Monkey Handler's Words</h3>
<p>— Bicheng</p>
<p>Military pigeons and military dogs are often seen in newspapers. Recently, there has been much talk about military monkeys. It is said that monkeys are very agile and can be taught to throw grenades. They can climb quickly and easily, and their small size makes them easy to avoid enemy bullets. I heard that a certain army in our country is starting to train military monkeys. If successful in the future, they will surpass pigeons and dogs and establish a unique position. There should be no doubt about that. However, there is a common saying, "green-bellied monkey," used to describe a fool, implying that no matter how many times you teach them, they will never learn. One day, I saw a monkey handler and asked him if monkeys could perform and whether they had any innate intelligence. I also asked if there were any so-called "green-bellied monkeys." The monkey handler smiled and said, "Green-bellied? You don't know, but we in this business have our ways of testing monkeys. First, we lock several monkeys in a room and feed them. Each monkey gets a clay pot. We teach them that after eating, they must put the clay pot on their heads, or they will be whipped. After teaching them carefully, the monkey handler leaves and locks the door, peeking through the crack. After the monkeys finish eating, some put the clay pot on their heads as instructed, while others don't. The monkey handler then makes a noise at the door, as if to open it. Those who haven't put on the pot quickly grab it and put it on their heads. When the door doesn't open, they take the pot off again. After a while, the door rattles again, and they quickly put the pot back on. The monkey handler silently notes each monkey. Those who are clever and intelligent are teachable and can be trained to perform. Those who wear the pot like wooden puppets without moving are unteachable and difficult to train. Isn't that what you call a 'green-bellied monkey'? Therefore, those who are now training military monkeys should be careful not to take them all indiscriminately and allow 'green-bellied monkeys' to be mixed in."</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Battle and Military Weapons (10)</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>Soft-Nosed Bullets: Originally called Dum Dum bullets. The name Dum Dum Bullet comes from the factory in Dum Dum, India. It is a type of pointed bullet with a unique poison. Being hit by this bullet will cause the entire body to swell, and there is no cure. Even touching the bullet will cause the skin to ulcerate. In 1899, during the war between Britain and the Boers in South Africa, this poisonous bullet was used to brutally kill enemy soldiers. The Hague Peace Conference Treaty specified that its use was prohibited. However, it was later used secretly in violation of the treaty. In 1912, the International Peace Conference banned it again. When the European War broke out, inhumane countries violated the treaty again and used this bullet extensively. After the war ended, the Washington Conference in 1922 saw Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries re-signed a treaty banning its use. Unexpectedly, in this Shanghai battle, our soldiers suffered severe injuries from this poisonous bullet.</p>
<p>Poisonous Bacteria: War is originally the most brutal act of mankind, and the use of poisonous gas and poisonous bullets is particularly intolerable in terms of humanity. Recently, an even more potent poison has been invented, called poisonous bacteria. It is made from various virulent infectious pathogens, loaded into a projector, and fired into the vast enemy lines. It not only inflicts fatal injuries on the enemy in combat but also causes the complete death of innocent civilians. However, the exact method of using poisonous bacteria has not yet been announced. It is likely that the bacteria will be loaded into bombs or artillery shells and fired, or dropped from airplanes. Therefore, the future of war is truly unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Escape (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Mingxiang</p>
<p>Just thinking about those things made him feel like the national crisis was truly upon him. Qian Ping was even more worried than his wife. All the terrors, troubles, and dangers of fleeing were now swirling in his mind, impossible to dismiss. It had completely erased the courage he had displayed when he volunteered to be the commander of the volunteer army in school when the Japanese first invaded Shenyang. The happiest to hear about the escape were Qian Ping's two children. They knew they would have the chance to go play in the countryside tomorrow, so they eagerly awaited the arrival of morning.</p>
<p>"Young master, there's a phone call from Wang on XX Road," the maid said as they were almost finished packing their luggage at ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p>After a long while, Qian Ping came back with a smile he hadn't shown in days, saying, "We don't need to escape anymore, no need to escape!"</p>
<p>"Why?" his wife asked.</p>
<p>"Young master, is the world at peace now, so we don't need to escape?" the maid also asked.</p>
<p>"We won another battle, so we don't need to escape. Besides, escaping is very dangerous. The boats going to the countryside today were completely looted by bandits, it's really terrifying!" Thus, Qian Ping told his wife the news he had received on the phone, saying that X city had been recovered by the volunteer army and that there had been significant progress in military affairs. For the time being, there was no need to escape. When his wife heard that they didn't need to escape, she felt relieved, as if the national crisis had passed. The children, on the other hand, puffed up their cheeks, looking unhappy, as if they had lost their playmates.</p>
<p>All the previous busyness now seemed laughable!</p>
<p>At dinner, the family was still comfortably in their exquisite home. His wife suddenly remembered that Qian Ping was also in the volunteer army and asked,</p>
<p>"What happened to the volunteer army at your school? I don't see them anymore."</p>
<p>"If it weren't for the good news, we would have been having dinner in the countryside tomorrow!" Qian Ping replied evasively. At the same time, a faint smile of shame appeared at the corner of his mouth. He was thinking, "After they counterattack, won't I still be showing off on the drill field as the commander?"</p>

<h3>Former Zhabei</h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received an article from Mr. Zhong Ji, asking who Zhabei belonged to. I have reorganized and extended its meaning to discuss with readers. The other day, while reading this newspaper, I unintentionally discovered an advertisement. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(So and so lawyers are appointed as the perennial legal advisors for so and so company in former Zhabei.)</p>
<p>I was quite surprised to see this advertisement. Although Zhabei, which is an inherent territory of our country, is currently temporarily occupied by the enemy, it is undoubtedly still Zhabei of our country. Because our Republic of China has not ceded Zhabei to any country, and no country has denied that Zhabei is not our territory, then that Zhabei, no matter what, is still entirely Zhabei of the territory of our Republic of China. The meaning is clear, what is left to say. Such a simple truth should be clear even to people who have not studied law. But the advertisement says, "So and so company in former Zhabei." I don't understand what the "former" means. Does it mean that the former was Zhabei, but now it is not? Does it mean that the former was Zhabei of our country, but the latter is not Zhabei of our country? Compared to the latter, what is the date before which it is "former Zhabei" and after which it is "latter Zhabei"? At first glance, the text is quite abrupt. Upon closer examination, the meaning is even more vague. If it is said that the company has ceased operations since the battle of Zhabei, then the "former" refers to the company. But since the lawyers are hired as perennial legal advisors for the company, then the company of the "former" day is still the company of today. If its name still exists, then its existence must still be ongoing, it is not as if after the previous company, there would be a new company. If it is said that the former is the company when it was in operation, and the latter is the company when it is no longer in operation, then the word "former" should also be added to the company's name, not Zhabei's. Furthermore, since the company hired the lawyers as perennial legal advisors, then the legal benefits of the company when it was operating should certainly be protected, and the legal benefits of the company when it has stopped operating should also be protected by the lawyers. If the word "former" is added, then the lawyers will guarantee the company of the former day, while the lawyers would not guarantee the company of the latter day.</p>
<p>In short, the text of our country is very ambiguous. At this critical moment, we must pay due attention to this matter, otherwise it will easily cause people to have doubts.</p>

<p>Opening Peace Talks</p>
<p>Today we open peace talks, tomorrow we open peace talks, it seems I've heard Zhabei will become a land ceded. Today we discuss troop withdrawal, tomorrow we discuss troop withdrawal, outside the city of Taicang day and night one hears the sounds of war. If the negotiator has no talent, how can one discuss without being open, the truce is still fierce, how can troops not withdraw. Alas, I say to those in high positions like Guo Huiluo, indecisive like Yan Zena, boasting that their tongues still hold the stage, what can one do with no plan. On the contrary, they say that there is not enough to worry about, for alliance can be appealed to, even if alliance is truly dependable, why do we not try again. The history of glory is stained with blood, I advise you not to seek a treaty under the city walls.</p>
