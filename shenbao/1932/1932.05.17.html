<p>前年十一月間日濱口首相遭受狙擊延至去年八月而殞命。今犬養首相復爲軍人所暗殺。繼濱口而殂逝。兩年之間。竟以暗殺死兩内閣。是誠爲日本之大不幸。　　此次血案尤足駭人聽聞。夫以京畿防衛森嚴之地。而一日之間。竟發生炸彈暗殺案多起。除海陸相外。政友會總部。京畿警局宮内大臣私邸東京市長私邸。三井三菱本店。日本銀行及其他重要機關。都遭轟炸。而其槍擊犬養之時。且有一軍官執犬養之肩頭。涙轉其軀。令其直對受彈。五槍齊放。而犬養遂負傷倒地。慘案發生。之後。暴徒猶擬破壞水電廠造成全市大恐怖。至其暗殺計劃。則且擬將財閥政客一網打盡。此種空前之大暴動。竟發生於（有組織）（有秩序）之强國之首都。斯則不僅爲日本之大不幸。實亦即震動世界之一大變局也。　　暴動之發生。爲由於少壯軍人派之仇恨政黨財閥。無以饜其慾。無以逞其志。遂不惜採取最毒辣之手段。以推翻政友會内閣。殆已毫無可疑。緣犬養之組閣。實得力於軍人之提携。犬養旣以拉攏軍人而得組閣。經議會選舉而得穏固。今乃不復聽其指揮。軍人憤爲政客所賣弄。自必傾覆之而後快。今犬養死矣。内閣已總辭職矣。藉軍人之力而興者。亦覆敗於軍人之手。而暮年之老政治家。且不得其死。此一幕政治悲劇。誠足以令吾人惕然憬悟。雖然。日本軍人勢力之張大。法西斯蒂主義之抬頭。亦足以令吾人談虎色變矣。　　犬養内閣旣傾。吾人可斷言日本必組超然内閣。而以軍人爲主幹。蓋邇年以來。彼少壯派之軍人。氣盛志盈。狂燥急進。好大喜功。而又牢囿於忠君愛國之偏激觀念。早已有擁護軍人内閣之决心。當若槻内閣崩潰之際。軍人内閣之呼聲。即曾甚囂塵上。今犬養内閣旣傾覆於軍人之手。而其他政黨。亦斷無由代政友會而興。故超然内閣之組織。當爲必然之事實。而大勢所趨者也。　　證此當前之事實。日本法西斯蒂運動。誠已日益激化。軍人勢力之張大。亦已可謂爲達到最高峯。此瀰漫磅礴之法西斯蒂之狂潮。如有若莫索里尼之統制意大利。則或尚不至使國家立即陷於混亂。然而今日日本之法西斯蒂運動。果有如莫索里尼其人者爲之領袖乎。脱韁之馬。疾馳狂奔。其前途殆至不可測。吾人蓋可斷言。由於法西斯蒂運動之抬頭。其在日本國内。左傾勢力。亦必日益張大。爭鬭更將激化。其在國外。必窮兵黷武。日美之戰爭。殆尤將早日促成其爆發。日本從茲多事。而世界之風雲。或亦將從茲日趨於緊張矣。</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>國際聨盟會中國代表處處長兼駐瑞士公使吳凱聲氏，新自日内瓦返國，當他蒞滬的翌晨，曾與記者晤見，他征塵甫卸，在百忙之中，和我立談十分鐘關於國際聨盟斷片的話，歸後追憶，頗有一紀的價值。他説：奉派駐會，瞬經三年，要是憑三年的經騐，把國聨的前前後後，原原本本，報告出來，斷非一時所能窮其道；且待晋京公畢以後，經這麽三兩月的功夫，寫一本專書，便國人明瞭它的内幕，現在先把日内瓦瑣屑，三言兩語，拉雜説來，以博閲者一粲。　　中日事件，竟引起如此嚴重的糾紛，國聨受理以後，認爲有史以來所不曾遇到的第一樁重大的案件。國聨方面，已是窮智絶慮，歷盡千辛萬苦的了，然事實上能有多大的成效？據我觀察，國聨對中日事件，大致可分作三個時期：（一）當九一八事變之初，國聨方面，不曾得到詳實的報告，不甚明瞭起事的眞相，一直到十月中旬在巴黎會議以前，是在猶豫時期。（二）巴黎會議到一二八上海戰爭以前，日本駐歐的外交代表，齊集巴黎，集中外交力量，一面用種種方法，聨絡巴黎報界，利用宣傳政策，輿論爲之一變；各國代表弄得眼花目眩，如豐五里霧中，結果巴黎會議於日本有利，國聨處於被惑時期。（三）一二八上海戰事爆發，日本大舉海陸空軍，施行武力脅迫幸賴我忠勇的第十九路軍第五軍奮力抵抗，相持一月有餘，雖不幸而退守第二道防線，但雙方敵對行動，依然存在，於是百業停頓，各國在華利益，大受侵害，世界輿論羣起反日，各國議會及有力的民衆團體，紛紛責難，反日空氣，日益濃厚，眞所謂天怒人怨，而日本破壞盟約，侵略土地的野心，大白於天下，國聨遂一變往日的態度，轉入於非難時期。　　國聨會員自最近墨西哥加入以後，共爲五十五國，據事實上的窺測，對華態度，約可分爲三組來説：（一）絶對表同情的，居十分之八；（二）居兩可之間的，約十分之一；（三）不表同情的，居十分之一。不過呢，這十分之八的國家，都是弱小民族，大槪弱小民族，最痛恨帝國主義侵犯人家的主權與土地，而對我富於友誼的同情。在歴次會議席上，各小國代表發言的激昻，可以證明。其他十分之二，却都是强國，勢力非常雄厚，數量上雖然小國來得多，而實際上還是仰人鼻息，雖欲主持正義，其如强國的阻撓，而莫可奈何！日本破壞盟約侵我主權奪我土地，我國始終不得國際公約的維護，便是因爲這種惡勢力作梗的緣故。</p>

<p>昨報載内政部擬建議行政院，俟後各省府廳長人選，應由中央主幹部提出，但已經任命者，亦應補送詳細履歷，交主管部審查，以免濫竽，這一個建議，是否澄清吏治的政策呢？還是一種包辦政策？　　怎樣呌濫竽？怎樣呌不濫竽？自辛亥革命以還，資格二字，早已打消，從前有（朝裏無人莫做官）的金科玉律，現在亦不能例外，祇要後臺有挺硬的老闆，即濫竽亦不濫竽，曾經一度參加革命工作的，即濫竽亦不濫竽，或者後面有幾根槍桿子的，即濫竽亦不濫竽，或者於某一條件上同一主義的，即濫竽亦不濫竽，　　現在各省府廳長人選，須經中央主幹部提出，已任命者，交主管部審查，則以後廳長人選，完全在主幹部的掌握，主幹部認爲濫竽即濫竽，主幹部認爲不濫竽即不濫竽，這原是集權的一種新制度，並不是澄清吏治，澄清吏治决不是這樣辦法，　　這是官樣文章之三</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan's Situation After the Death of Inukai Tsuyoshi <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In November of the year before last, Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi was shot and died last August from his injuries. Now Prime Minister Inukai has also been assassinated by soldiers, following Hamaguchi in death. Two cabinets have been lost to assassination in two years. This is truly a great misfortune for Japan.</p>
<p>This latest bloody incident is especially shocking and appalling. In the well-defended capital region, multiple bombings and assassinations occurred in a single day. Besides the Navy and Army Ministers, the Seiyukai headquarters, the Kyoto police headquarters, the private residences of the Minister of the Imperial Household and the Mayor of Tokyo, the Mitsui and Mitsubishi main offices, the Bank of Japan, and other important institutions were all bombed. When Inukai was shot, a military officer even grabbed Inukai's shoulders, turned him around with tears in his eyes, and made him face the bullets directly. Five shots were fired simultaneously, and Inukai fell to the ground wounded. After the tragic incident, the rioters even planned to destroy water and electricity plants to create city-wide terror. Their assassination plan aimed to eliminate all the zaibatsu and politicians in one fell swoop. Such an unprecedented large-scale riot has occurred in the capital of a (organized) (orderly) powerful nation. This is not only a great misfortune for Japan but also a major upheaval that shakes the world.</p>
<p>The riot occurred because the young military officers resented the political parties and the financial cliques, which could not satisfy their desires or fulfill their ambitions. Therefore, they did not hesitate to take the most vicious measures to overthrow the Seiyukai cabinet, and there is little doubt about this. Inukai's cabinet was established with the help of the military. Having secured the cabinet by winning over the military, and consolidated it through parliamentary elections, Inukai now refused to listen to their commands. The military, angered at being manipulated by politicians, would certainly want to overthrow him. Now that Inukai is dead and the cabinet has resigned en masse, those who rose to power by relying on the military have also been defeated by them. The old statesman of advanced age did not even die a natural death. This political tragedy should serve as a stark warning. However, the growth of the Japanese military's power and the rise of Fascism are also enough to make us turn pale with fear.</p>
<p>Now that the Inukai cabinet has fallen, we can assert that Japan will form a non-partisan cabinet, with the military as its backbone. In recent years, these young military officers have been arrogant, ambitious, restless, eager for advancement, and bound by extreme notions of loyalty to the Emperor and love for the country. They have long been determined to support a military cabinet. When the Wakatsuki cabinet collapsed, calls for a military cabinet were already rampant. Now that the Inukai cabinet has been overthrown by the military, no other political party can replace the Seiyukai. Therefore, the formation of a non-partisan cabinet is inevitable and the general trend.</p>
<p>Considering the current reality, Japan's Fascist movement is indeed becoming increasingly intense. The growth of the military's power can be said to have reached its peak. If this pervasive and powerful tide of Fascism were to have someone like Mussolini to control Italy, it might not immediately lead the country into chaos. However, does Japan's Fascist movement today have a leader like Mussolini? A runaway horse, galloping wildly, its future is almost unpredictable. We can assert that, due to the rise of the Fascist movement, the leftist forces within Japan will also grow stronger, and the conflict will intensify. Internationally, it will inevitably resort to military aggression, and a war between Japan and the United States is likely to be expedited. Japan will be troubled from now on, and the global situation will also become increasingly tense.</p>

<p>Takahashi Korekiyo to Act as Prime Minister / Possibility of a Non-Partisan Cabinet Realizing / Military Faction's Overt Party Movement</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th - After being shot, Inukai Tsuyoshi lingered between life and death for over six hours, remaining conscious throughout. Blood transfusions provided some temporary relief, but he ultimately succumbed to his injuries at 11:35 PM. Inukai Tsuyoshi was 76 years old. After graduating from Keio University, he became a reporter, then the editor of the "Report" newspaper. Later, he founded a magazine and advocated for tariff protection policies. In 1890, he was elected to the House of Representatives. In 1898, during Okuma's cabinet, Inukai served as Minister of Education. In October 1929, he became the chairman of the Kokusai Tsūun Kaigi, and in December of that year, he succeeded Wakatsuki as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 16th - The cabinet announced that Prime Minister Inukai passed away at 2:35 AM on the 16th. The direct cause of death was a gunshot wound to the right forehead, which penetrated the base of the brain and entered the skull, causing blood vessel damage, hemorrhage, brain compression, breathing difficulties, and heart paralysis.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - Today, key figures of the Seiyukai decided that the funeral of the late Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi will be arranged by the Seiyukai and will be held on Thursday.</p>

<p>Cabinet Resigns En Masse, But Urged to Stay</p>
<p>▲ Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - After the news of Inukai's death spread, the cabinet members held an emergency meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence and decided that Minister of Finance Takahashi Korekiyo would temporarily serve as acting Prime Minister. He immediately went to the Imperial Palace for an audience with the Emperor. At 4:00 AM on the 16th, the Emperor held a ceremony to appoint Takahashi as acting Prime Minister. Takahashi, now 86 years old and a respected elder in Japanese financial circles, convened a cabinet meeting at 10:00 AM, where he delivered an inaugural address and gave a detailed report on the assassination of former Prime Minister Inukai. At 11:50 AM, Takahashi, accompanied by all the cabinet members, submitted their resignations to the Emperor, expressing their regret over the six bombing incidents. The Emperor returned the resignations, urged them to continue in their posts, and instructed them to remain in office until the case reached a certain point, after which the cabinet's future would be decided.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - Acting Prime Minister Takahashi entered the Imperial Palace at 11:30 AM this morning and submitted the cabinet's collective resignation. The selection of a successor to the Prime Minister remains uncertain. Some speculate that Privy Council Vice President Hiranuma Kiichirō will form a new cabinet, but it is unlikely that any members of the old government will retain their positions.</p>

<p>Araki Narrowly Escapes Harm</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - Navy Minister Ōsumi and Army Minister Araki have resigned to acknowledge responsibility and asked Takahashi to forward their resignations. The other cabinet members have decided to remain in their posts for the time being. Since the gunmen who assassinated the Prime Minister were all army and navy personnel, the two ministers bear special responsibility. Police Superintendent-General Ono and other senior police officers have also collectively resigned to Interior Minister Suzuki to take responsibility. Takahashi Korekiyo, the acting Prime Minister…</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - At 1:00 PM today, an informal high-level military conference was held at the Army Minister's official residence. Army Minister Araki had already resigned last night to acknowledge responsibility. He stated at today's conference that this was the only course of action he could take. Araki also explained the current situation in Kyoto. Chief Aide-de-Camp Suzuki and the Emperor's Chief Military Aide Nara held a meeting in the Imperial Palace at 2:00 AM this morning, which lasted until 8:30 AM. Minister of the Imperial Household Count Ikimoto also participated in the meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th - The Military Council has decided to appoint Deputy Chief of the General Staff Masaki Jinzaburō as Army Minister to succeed Araki. Regardless of whether the cabinet accepts the resignation of Navy Minister Ōsumi, this decision will be implemented. It is rumored that Araki narrowly escaped harm last night. At midnight, six rioters broke into the Army Minister's residence, threatened his family, and forbade them from making any noise. Araki was fortunate to have been attending a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 16th - Navy Minister Ōsumi has decided to resign. Military Councilor Admiral Okada Keisuke is the most likely candidate to succeed him. As for the successor to the Army Minister, there is talk of appointing either Commander of the Korean Army General Hayashi Senjūrō or Deputy Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Mazaki Jinzaburō.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Elder Statesman Saionji Rushes to Kyoto <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>To Resolve the Issue of the Successor Cabinet</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - Elder Statesman Duke Saionji, recognizing the seriousness of the situation after yesterday's violence, has decided to depart immediately from Okitsu for Tokyo. It is expected that after Saionji arrives in Kyoto, he will convene an emergency meeting with the ministers.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - This afternoon, it was heard that Duke Saionji is very concerned about the situation and has sent his personal secretary, Baron Harada, ahead to Kyoto. Harada is expected to arrive in Kyoto tonight.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - Duke Saionji, concerned about the situation, will arrive in Kyoto in the next day or two. He is likely to hold a meeting of key ministers in Kyoto. It is noteworthy who he will recommend when the Emperor inquires about the successor cabinet. If the president of the Seiyukai is decided at this time, the question remains whether the new Seiyukai cabinet will be able to suppress the nationalist movement. Moreover, the power of the Minseitō is very weak, and a cabinet uniting both parties may be formed. However, the movement to support Hiranuma Kiichirō cannot be ignored. Therefore, the decision on the successor cabinet is likely to be quite complicated.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th - Although members of the Seiyukai hope that Elder Statesman Duke Saionji will advise the Emperor to order Acting Prime Minister Takahashi to form a new Seiyukai cabinet, the current situation suggests that a coalition cabinet or a supra-party cabinet will be formed. There is considerable infighting within the Seiyukai, so there are conflicting opinions on who should succeed Inukai Tsuyoshi as president. If the Seiyukai splits due to the dispute over the election of a president, it will be difficult for it to continue to hold power.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Radical Advancement of the Military Faction Movement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>▲ Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - This incident is entirely a horrific plot of the Japanese Fascist movement. This plot had been secretly planned since the September 18th Manchurian Incident, with the intention of launching an uprising in November, but it was discovered by the government and prevented, averting an immediate crisis. However, the Fascist movement has not ceased for a single day. The assassinations of Inoue Takuma and others two months ago were carried out by the Blood Pledge Corps of that faction. The rapid progress of this faction's movement in this incident is even more evident. The general public anticipates that there may be significant changes in Japan's national structure in the near future, and senior officials are extremely concerned about this. Duke Saionji's arrival in Tokyo in the next few days is seen as a key factor in dealing with this situation.</p>
<p>▲ China United Press, Tokyo, 16th - The Fascist revolutionary movement of Japanese army and navy officers had already occupied key government institutions and assassinated key members of the Minseitō cabinet at 1:00 PM on October 17th of last year. At that time, the planned assassination targets were Wakatsuki, Shidehara, Inoue, and senior officials of the Imperial Household, including Elder Statesman Duke Saionji. However, the plot was discovered by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and over 300 masterminds were investigated. The main figures were young officers of the General Staff headquarters, who were connected to graduates of army officer schools nationwide, forming a strong secret organization. On the civilian side, the current Vice President of the Privy Council, Hiranuma Kiichirō, was also in communication. Hiranuma's Kokuhonsha had many veterans as members. The current Army Minister Araki Sadao was its leader, but after Araki became minister, his policies were often influenced by the cabinet, leading to dissatisfaction among young officers, especially regarding the Shanghai armistice agreement, as it deprived them of opportunities for achievement. The motives of the Japanese military in this incident are therefore based on this. However, what are the policies they advocate?</p>
<p>(1) To occupy Manchuria and Mongolia as Japanese territory; (2) To return industries to the Emperor and have them managed by the military-fascist party; (3) To adopt an absolutely uncooperative stance towards the League of Nations; (4) To immediately wage war against Soviet Russia and the United States to eliminate future threats; (5) To overthrow party politics and capitalists.</p>
<p>In order to occupy Manchuria and Mongolia, they must provoke conflicts with Russia and the United States and be constrained by the League of Nations. Therefore, in diplomacy, they advocate withdrawing from the League of Nations. Regarding the Manchurian and Mongolian policies, if the United States and Russia interfere, they will go to war. According to the Japanese military's divine calculations, they believe that within the next three years, the army will have the power to destroy Russia, and the navy will be able to defeat the American navy. If they miss this opportunity, Japan will never have the hope of dominating Asia. This is the first step in the Japanese military's unilateral decision, and they also want to overthrow the zaibatsu for two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The zaibatsu prioritize money and do not sacrifice their interests for the country, and they are unwilling to contribute large sums for aggressive military expenses, so they must be overthrown. (2) If they raise a large army, most of the soldiers will be the sons of workers and farmers. The current workers and farmers are suffering greatly, and unemployed workers and farmers are spreading throughout the country. If they do not gain the sympathy of the workers and farmers, raising an army will surely fail. Therefore, to attack Russia and America, they must first overthrow the zaibatsu and return the industries to the Emperor, to be managed by the military.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th - While yesterday's turmoil can be seen as a manifestation of the dissatisfaction of the Japanese people with the political, social, and economic situation, it appears that those who carried out these acts of violence did not receive the support or sympathy of responsible parties or the general public. All parts of Japan are now condemning this violence. Although the current situation is often criticized, leading to the rapid spread of movements similar to vigilante groups in recent months, there are few who truly advocate violence and direct action. Apart from the assassination of Inukai Tsuyoshi, the other riots were relatively insignificant and lacked coordination, mostly appearing to be demonstrative in nature. According to reports from various locations, the entire country, including Tokyo, remains calm. On the surface, work and leisure activities continue as before.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Shanghai, 16th - Today, London and New York are rife with rumors of a naval rebellion in Japanese domestic waters. Both locations have telegraphed the Far East, inquiring about the truth and seeking detailed information. The Shanghai Reuters office immediately inquired with the Tokyo Reuters office and subsequently received a midnight (Tokyo time) reply stating that the rumors of a naval rebellion are completely unfounded.</p>

<p>Confessions of Patriotic, Loyal, and Extremist Individuals</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th - It is now known that before the bombings last night, a man dressed in a military officer's uniform shot and seriously wounded reserve junior officer Nishida. Nishida had recently been imprisoned for his involvement with the Blood Pledge Corps. The Blood Pledge Corps was discovered after the assassination of Mitsui president Dan Takuma on March 5th of this year. The individuals the Blood Pledge Corps intended to harm were Inukai Tsuyoshi, Saionji, Tokugawa, Wakatsuki, and Shidehara. The man who shot Nishida, named Kawasaki, is also connected to the Blood Pledge Corps. Police are currently searching for Kawasaki, believing that the shooting of Nishida will prove that yesterday's bombings were a conspiracy by the Blood Pledge Corps.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th - Kawasaki, the assailant who shot reserve junior officer Nishida yesterday, disguised himself as a coolie and hid in the home of a foreman. He was arrested this morning. It is now believed that Kawasaki shot Nishida because he believed Nishida had testified against members of the Blood Pledge Corps for the government.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - A total of eighteen perpetrators were involved in the sudden incident last night. After committing their acts, all of them surrendered themselves. Since the incident occurred, all prosecutors from the Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office, including the Prosecutor General, had been at their offices by 10:00 PM, beginning their investigation into the truth of the incident. The lights in the Prosecutor's Office remained on throughout the night. According to the results of interrogating the perpetrators, it has been determined that this assassination of the Prime Minister is related to the Inoue Nissho's secret society assassination group, the Blood Pledge Corps, which was involved in the previous assassination of former Finance Minister Inoue.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th - Five naval officers, all with the rank of lieutenant, and thirteen army students who had surrendered themselves were all young. They had left the military academy without graduating. This indicates that the criminals are rash youths with extremist ideas of patriotism and loyalty to the Emperor. The leaflets they distributed emphasized the responsibility of subjects to their monarch.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 16th - The Army Ministry has decided to have the perpetrators of the bombings tried by court-martial and severely punished after the preliminary hearing is completed.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - The Army Ministry announced that those involved used extreme measures due to their outrage over the current situation in Japan, causing an unfortunate incident. The members of the army involved are eleven students of the Military Academy. They were taken into custody at the Tokyo Military Police Headquarters after the incident and are currently under investigation. The Navy Ministry announced that the members of the navy involved in this unfortunate incident are six junior officers, including one in the reserves. They surrendered themselves to the military police after the incident and are currently in custody for investigation.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - Regarding the disturbances in Tokyo, Army Minister Araki told someone that being agitated and flustered is of no use. First, it is appropriate to think carefully about the measures to take in the aftermath. Second, we must find a way to prevent this type of incident from happening again. Therefore, we must first seek the root cause of this matter. However, the method cannot be clearly stated at this time.</p>

<p>Three Factions Stand, Infighting is Intense</p>
<p>▲ Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - At 10:00 AM today, the Seiyukai convened a general meeting of Diet members to discuss the issue of the successor president. There were proposals to nominate either Secretary-General Mori or Okazaki as the successor president, but the younger faction strongly opposed this, advocating for the use of a voting method. The meeting was highly contentious and ended without a result. The Seiyukai is likely to experience a serious split due to the issue of President Inukai. The party has historically been divided into the Suzuki, Kuhara, and Tokonami factions, and infighting has been intense. Inukai mediated to prevent a split. In the future, if no respected elder who is trusted by all factions takes office as president, it is unlikely that the three factions will be able to cooperate again. However, the Seiyukai currently has no talent who can be hoped for, so the future of the Seiyukai is very dangerous.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - The Seiyukai plans to recommend the current acting Prime Minister and Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo as the successor president.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - Acting Prime Minister Takahashi, who was recommended as the successor president of the Seiyukai, has firmly declined due to his advanced age and physical condition. As a result, Interior Minister Suzuki and Tokonami Takejiro are now in opposition. Therefore, a public election for president will eventually be held.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu, 16th - The Minseitō attaches great importance to this incident. Last night, they discussed everything at the residence of President Wakatsuki and at party headquarters. Some young Diet members advocated a hardline stance, stating that at this time, they should set aside minor differences and move towards the common goal of party politics, supporting the Seiyukai cabinet and engaging in an anti-fascist movement. However, the senior members mostly advocated self-restraint, stating that it was appropriate to temporarily observe the shifting situation and cautiously decide on their attitude. They scheduled another meeting of the Executive Council this morning to consider this matter.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - At noon today, the Minseitō held an informal meeting of members of both houses of the Diet at the party headquarters. At the meeting, President Wakatsuki gave a speech, stating that Prime Minister Inukai, who worked hard for Japan's constitutional government, met with an unfortunate disaster and passed away, which he deeply regretted and expressed sympathy. He said that parliamentary politics represents the spirit of the Meiji Restoration, but the political situation does not allow for forceful measures. We must, in any case, uphold constitutional politics, so he hoped that the members would not be directed by a third party during the temporary Diet session and urged them to pay close attention.</p>

<p>▲ At 5:30 PM, two stout men wearing brown and black Western-style suits arrived at the front gate of the Bank of Japan in a car with license plate number 5493. They threw a hand grenade. With a loud explosion, the men escaped in the same car. The grenade went over the front gate wall of the bank, landing in the hall and exploding.</p>
<p>▲ At 7:30 PM, someone threw a grenade at the Mitsubishi headquarters in Marunouchi. Because it was a Sunday and also dusk, there were few pedestrians, so no one was injured when it exploded.</p>
<p>▲ At 5:30 PM, a car sped up to the Sakurada Gate in front of the Metropolitan Police Department and stopped. Someone wearing a gray Western-style suit in the car took out a handgun and fired wildly at the Metropolitan Police Department. Many patrol officers and others inside the Metropolitan Police Department heard the gunfire and rushed out of the main gate. The stout man raised his gun and fired again, then sped away in the same car, scattering leaflets along the way titled "An Appeal to the Japanese People." The police chased after him to Otebori in front of the Nijubashi Bridge, but lost track of him. As the stout man was firing wildly, one bullet hit the leg of Yomiuri Shimbun reporter Takahashi, and another hit the lower jaw of a Metropolitan Police Department night watchman, both of whom were seriously injured.</p>
<p>▲ At 5:40 PM, the car that attacked the Metropolitan Police Department arrived at the Seiyukai headquarters in Uchisaiwaichō and threw two hand grenades at the front gate of the Seiyukai headquarters.

<p>▲ At 5:30 PM, someone threw a grenade at the residence of Chief Aide-de-Camp Suzuki in Gobancho, Kojimachi Ward. The details are unclear. (The above is a report from Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>▲ Power Plant - Several grenades were thrown at the Tokyo Electric Power Plant, far away in a neighboring prefecture, also at around 7:00 PM on the 15th. Officials believed that the rioters' actions were clearly intended to extinguish some of the lights in Tokyo, so they could take advantage of the darkness to carry out other acts of violence. (Report from Kokumin News Agency). After the bombing incidents, the police learned that the rioters had a plan to destroy water and power plants to increase the disorder. On the evening of the 15th, three electrical substations were bombed, but there was no major damage. The rioters had other acts of disruption planned, but because the police received advance notice and were strictly on alert throughout the country, the rioters were afraid of being arrested and did not succeed. (Report from Reuters)</p>
<p>▲ Counselor Beaten - At 11:00 PM, Counselor Imai of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was beaten by a soldier in front of the Prime Minister's official residence. Fortunately, the police came to his aid, and Imai was able to escape without being injured. The assailant was subsequently arrested by the military police and confessed to being named Matsu, an active-duty officer in the army, at the Military Police Headquarters. In total, those who committed crimes in yesterday's cases included five naval officers, eleven army cadet officers, and several army officer candidates. That night, the military police and police searched everywhere and arrested countless suspected criminals. Three trucks were filled with prisoners and sent to the Military Police Headquarters. The authorities specially mobilized 150 members of the Imperial Guard and stationed them at the Military Police Headquarters.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th - After the bombings, the situation on the surface remained calm. Apart from newspaper boys occasionally ringing their bells to sell the extras, there were no signs of disturbance.

<p>▲ Reuters, Nanjing, 16th: Last night, upon receiving news of the assassination attempt on Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, the National Government immediately sent a telegram of condolence. Subsequently, upon receiving an official telegram from the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo stating that Inukai Tsuyoshi had succumbed to his injuries, the condolence telegram was changed to a telegram of mourning. This afternoon, three more telegrams were sent, one from the National Government, one from Foreign Minister Luo, and one from President Wang.</p>
<p>▲ Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: After the Japanese Consul in Nanjing notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the passing of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi due to assassination, the Ministry instructed Jiang Huaben, the Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, to express condolences to the Japanese government on behalf of the National Government.</p>
<p>▲ Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Following the death of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi due to his injuries, the ambassadors of more than twenty countries, including Great Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs together at 10:00 AM to express their condolences.

<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 15th: Today, U.S. Under Secretary of State Castle and key officials of the State Department expressed their regret regarding the assassination and bombing in Tokyo. However, they declined to comment further until receiving more detailed information. Nevertheless, an impression has arisen here that Japanese militarists are seeking to further control the government, aiming to establish a political system similar to Italian Fascism.</p>
<p>▲ Far East News Agency, Rome, 16th: Yesterday (15th) afternoon, details of the shooting of the Prime Minister and the bombing of other government officials' private residences and financial institutions in Tokyo reached here at 9:00 AM today, attracting serious attention from all parties. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini made a brief statement on the matter, saying that the Fascist movement originated in Italy and has now spread to various countries. The Japanese Fascist movement has recently begun to emerge and is progressing rapidly, apparently already exerting significant control over politics. The old Japanese political parties have proven incapable of maintaining political order. Therefore, he anticipates that the Japanese Fascist movement may seize control of the Japanese government.</p>
<p>▲ Far East News Agency, Berlin, 16th: News of the assassination of the Japanese Prime Minister reached here this morning, causing great shock among officials. According to opinions expressed by officials, Japan has recently experienced a series of unfortunate events, and now this serious incident has occurred. This matter may not only affect Japanese politics, but the entire world may also be shaken by this act of terror.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 16th: The Daily Telegraph commented today on the assassination of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, saying that this incident, like previous assassinations, almost indicates a determination for more drastic action in Shanghai and Manchuria in Japanese policy.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 16th: The Manchester Guardian commented today on the assassination of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, stating that the future peace of the Far East largely depends on how the struggle between Japanese civil and military factions is resolved. The Liberal Party's News Chronicle stated that it seems unlikely that the situation in Manchuria can be prolonged without an explosion. From the beginning of Japan's troubles in Manchuria, many had foreseen the nature of the explosion. There are now various reasons to believe that the last thing Soviet Russia desires is a Manchurian war. Enlightened Japanese citizens look to the future with trepidation. However, the policy of forcing Japan to send a large army of 100,000 men into Manchuria has a tendency to directly lead to a Russo-Japanese conflict, and it is feared that no government can stop it. The newspaper questioned what the rest of the world will do about this increasingly pressing new war. Will the League of Nations and the powers sit idly by and do nothing as disaster looms, endangering themselves? Ceasefire Agreement</p>
<h3 id="e16">Copy Signed Yesterday <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Japanese language meaning in the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement copy is being modified according to our requirements. The Japanese side only received instructions from Tokyo regarding the modification issue yesterday at noon. Consequently, Okazaki, a third secretary from the Japanese Embassy, accompanied by interpreter Arino, visited Zhang Sixu, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Shanghai at Fenglin Bridge, at 2:20 PM for discussions. The Japanese side initially insisted on not making any modifications. Subsequently, our side repeatedly and thoroughly refuted their misunderstanding of the original English meaning and strongly argued the difference between (當分９間) and (暫時), and the absolute difference between the two words (附近) and (鄰接). After two hours of mutual consultation, a decision was finally made at 4:15 PM. As a result, the Japanese side completely accepted our side's modifications to the two sentences. At that time, it was also agreed that the signing ceremony would be held immediately. Therefore, each side notified their respective representatives by telephone. Our chief representative, Guo Taiqi, invited military representatives Dai Ji and Huang Qiang to Guo's residence on Rue Lory in the French Concession to prepare for the signing. Subsequently, at 4:35 PM, Zhang Sixu, Okazaki, and Arino, carrying the Chinese and Japanese copies, arrived at Guo's residence by car to sign the agreement. Our representatives Guo, Dai, and Huang expressed their condolences and sympathies regarding the assassination of Inukai Tsuyoshi. The signing was completed at 5:00 PM, after which they traveled separately by car to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road and the Shanghai Branch of the Japanese Army Hospital on Pingliang Road, awaiting the signatures of Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu, Japanese military representative Ueda, and Chief of Staff Tashiro. Thus, the meaning of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement copy, after more than ten days of long discussion, was finally resolved. The modifications made in both languages were quite balanced, with two points modified in the Chinese text and two points in the Japanese text. The two points in the Chinese text were: (戰鬥行爲) is now modified to (敵對行爲), (地點) is now modified to (地方). The two points in the Japanese text were: (當分９間) is now modified to (暫時), (附近) is now modified to (鄰接). According to what was published by various newspapers, the Chinese text of the agreement only slightly modifies the wording of Articles 1 and 3.</p>

<p>Bullets Fall on Our Military Headquarters and Police Station　　He Zhuguo Orders His Subordinates to Maintain Calm　　Shanhaiguan, 15th, 11 PM. The Japanese garrison stationed south of Yuguan Station and the Japanese military police stationed north of the station simultaneously conducted exercises within their barracks and headquarters, firing blank cartridges, machine guns, and live ammunition rifles. More than a dozen Type 38 live rounds landed near the sentry post of our army on the corner tower, and many stray bullets landed within the city, lasting for about half an hour before stopping. At 10 PM, "Manchukuo" border surveillance police, in groups of four, all disguised as Japanese, monitored our Nanguan stationed police, preventing them from acting. Our military police maintained calm, and the area remained peaceful. When the shooting began, the Japanese military police informally notified our military inspection office that it was an exercise. They told the liaison office for troops stationed in various countries that they were attacking bandits, their intentions being sinister. This morning, more than 120 "Manchukuo" border police, who had recently arrived in Yu, wandered around the streets inside and outside the city. (16th, Special Dispatch)　　Qinhuangdao. After midnight last night, Japanese soldiers stationed near Shanhaiguan began shooting. According to reliable sources, bullets fell on the Chinese military headquarters, but there was no damage. However, the public was greatly alarmed and flocked to Qinhuangdao this morning. According to a phone call from the Shanhaiguan authorities, in the past two weeks, Japanese soldiers have been conducting night exercises, firing blank rounds and often notifying the Chinese authorities in advance. However, last night around 11 PM, without prior notification, gunfire erupted again, this time firing live rounds, hitting the police headquarters in the southeast corner of the city wall. He Zhuguo is now making every effort to reassure the public and prevent his soldiers from clashing with the Japanese soldiers. (16th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A special Reuters correspondent stationed in Yu specially interviewed Brigade Commander He Zhuguo yesterday to inquire about the true situation of the Sino-Japanese situation. Brigade Commander He said that the Tokyo side recently received a telegram from Shenyang stating that Japanese troops had clashed with Zhang Xueliang's volunteers near Yuguan on the previous Friday, with 120 Chinese soldiers killed. This is simply nonsense and has no factual basis. The situation in Yuguan is superficially peaceful, but the provocative attitude of the Japanese is worrying. Recently, a group of police from (Manchukuo) arrived at Yuguan Station from the Kwantung Leased Territory, including 40 Japanese or Koreans and 20 Chinese. He said that he had guaranteed to the Japanese side that he would prohibit volunteers from entering Manchuria within the area directly under his jurisdiction. He has fulfilled this guarantee, but he has firmly rejected the Japanese side's request to freely arrest (suspects) in Yu. If the Japanese launch an attack, he is determined to resist, but in order to avoid possible misunderstandings, our side has not actively increased defenses. According to neutral observers, the situation in Yuguan is very similar to Tianjin last year, and its potential for danger is undoubtedly high. (Manchukuo) police continue to intrude into Guan, and the Japanese side is vigorously increasing defenses, causing widespread panic. According to the Railway Bureau, there were almost no passengers on the Beining Road in the past three days, but there has been slight improvement today. (15th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Believes This Is a Way to Prove Peaceful Intentions　　Galen Declares That Preparations for War Must Continue　　(Moscow) Today, the Communist Party's organ newspaper, Izvestia, published a commentary on the front page by a well-known Soviet Russian journalist, Leiteke, severely urging Japan that if it wishes to prove its peaceful intentions towards Russia, it must conclude a non-aggression treaty. Although the recent statement by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressing a friendly attitude towards Russia is gratifying, it is still necessary to conclude a formal treaty. The article also questions the Japanese language, asking whether, at a time of tension in the Far East, Japan is willing to jointly shoulder the obligation with Soviet Russia to peacefully resolve all issues. At the same time, the Red Star newspaper, the organ newspaper of the Army Commissariat (i.e., the Ministry of the Army), also published a special issue containing an article by General Bai Luqian (i.e., Galen), Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Red Army, stating that international relations are becoming increasingly complex, and the imperialists' preparations for war against the Soviets are becoming increasingly evident. We must be constantly vigilant, and we must continue to prepare for war. Bai's article was specifically addressed to the Far Eastern Red Army.

<p>Chen Jitang Denies Supporting Ceasefire Proposal (Guangzhou) Xiao Focheng and others, members of the Central Supervisory Committee stationed in Guangdong, sent a telegram stating: "To all newspapers, please note that we, the undersigned, have sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government today, which reads: 'According to reports, the Shanghai ceasefire agreement was signed on the solemn anniversary of our Premier assuming the presidency. We were shocked and astonished upon reading the details. Since the Shanghai Incident occurred, the government has repeatedly declared a long-term resistance, but instead hastily relocated the capital. The 19th Route Army fought bravely, but ultimately retreated due to lack of support. Public sentiment was indignant and unbearable, yet we sympathized with the government's difficulties and tolerated the situation, hoping for the completion of the ceasefire negotiations, so that the Japanese troops could withdraw as soon as possible, and the sovereignty of our country could be preserved. We have also stated our position to the Central Government in our telegrams, advocating that the Shanghai Incident should be resolved simultaneously with the Dongbei (Manchurian) Incident, and that the three principles of troop withdrawal should be upheld. The Central Executive Committee replied that its intention was consistent with that of our comrades. However, this ceasefire negotiation only addresses the Shanghai Incident, while neglecting the Dongbei Incident, which is a grave miscalculation. Even considering the agreement itself, as stipulated in Article 2, it is unclear what constitutes "normalcy" and how the "measures" will be determined, as no clear explanations are attached. If the Japanese use the pretext that the measures have not been decided and normalcy has not been restored, our country will never have the freedom to station troops in the extensive areas listed in Attachment No. 1. Although the Supplementary Rules stipulate that a joint committee can monitor the implementation, its ultimate power is only to urge attention and cannot enforce compliance. Article 4 stipulates that both sides withdraw, treating the aggressor and the aggressed equally. How can our troops withdraw within our own territory? Furthermore, the same article stipulates that the Japanese troops will withdraw and be replaced by Chinese police. The statement attached by our country even declares the willingness to voluntarily establish a special security police force to maintain order, which is tantamount to admitting that this area can only be defended by police in the future, and there is no right to station troops, which is no different from the stipulations of the Boxer Protocol that troops cannot be stationed in areas near Tianjin. In recent months, the people and our colleagues have yearned for the government to take action, but the result has been this. The government has consistently refused to allow us to inquire about the terms of the agreement. Various groups in Shanghai have repeatedly appealed for clarification, but the government has remained silent. Even the statutory legislative body, which must approve diplomatic events, according to newspaper reports, was not given sufficient time for consideration and hastily passed the agreement. What diplomatic action, if not one that forfeits rights and humiliates the nation, would require absolute secrecy and a hasty signing? In the past, Yuan Shikai secretly sold out the country by signing the Twenty-One Demands, which the people still resent to this day. How can the authorities of our revolutionary government follow in his footsteps? This matter concerns the survival of the nation, and it is difficult to remain silent. We earnestly submit this petition, hoping for your consideration.' The telegram is jointly signed by Ze Ru, Zou Lu, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Lin Yunhai, Bai Chongxi, Lin Zhimian, Huang Xuchu, Liu Jiwen, Deng Qingyang, Lin Yizhong, Cheng Tiangu, Xiang Hanping, Qu Fangpu, Chen Yaoyuan, Li Yangjing, Li Qiqian, Miao Peinan, Li Renren, Yu Hanmou, Zhan Jusi, Cui Guangxiu, and Guan Suren."

<p>Decision to Take Concerted Action ▲ National News Agency, Belgrade, 15th: The regular meeting of the foreign affairs authorities of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, the three Little Entente countries, held every six months, closed today. According to a statement issued tonight, the foreign affairs authorities of the three countries thoroughly discussed the current European situation and decided to take concerted action in future negotiations to restore the economic and political balance of Europe. Subsequently, the Czech Foreign Minister Benes told representatives of the press that the result of this meeting was that the three countries had fully agreed on all important issues. The current situation in Europe is extremely critical, but he, as an optimist, still believes that there is no despair and that it can be salvaged. Referring to the Lausanne Conference, he said that the three countries intend to adopt a moderate policy and not make concessions on any key points. The foreign affairs authorities of the three countries not only know that their interests are consistent but also believe that their interests are closely related to those of neighboring countries. The resolution of the problems in Central Europe cannot be achieved by the small countries alone and must rely on the goodwill and cooperation of other countries. U.S. House of Representatives</p>
<h3 id="e74">Report on Silver Issues <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Advocates that the United States convene an international conference to find ways to restore the balance of gold and silver parity. ▲ National News Agency, Washington, 15th: The U.S. House of Representatives' Somers Silver Subcommittee has drafted a report in which a majority of the members agree that the U.S. President should invite countries that emphasize restoring prices to hold an international conference to stabilize finance and restore the balance of gold and silver parity through currency and other methods, thereby restoring prices. The report elaborates on the uneven distribution of gold and the inability of non-gold standard countries to repay debts. It believes that China will not necessarily be able to switch to the gold standard within two or three decades because its people are constrained by customs and are not yet prepared to adopt the gold standard credit standard. It also traces the causes of the world financial panic to the U.S. sale of silver in 1929 and 1920, India's switch to the gold standard, and the destruction of silver coins in 1928 and 1929, which led to international exchange chaos. It also states that after the fall in silver prices in Asia, capital in silver units became gold units. With the disuse of gold, there was a growing shortage, and the central banks of gold standard countries felt their gold reserves were dwindling daily. Therefore, when China continues to use the silver standard, the parity of gold and silver must be balanced to avoid excessive disparity. If an international conference can reverse the current gold reserve method, the Far East does not need to store gold for exchange purposes, and gold worth US$100 billion can be released for other uses.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Hopewell, 16th: Lindbergh's son's ashes will be buried next to his grandfather Morrow's grave. Morrow passed away last year when Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh were in China. Colonel Lindbergh is now leading guards carrying automatic rifles, hoping to find maritime bandits, fearing that the bandits may want to kidnap Colonel Lindbergh in order to escape the law. The bandits who previously demanded a ransom of 50,000 yuan from Colonel Lindbergh now tell shipbuilding tycoon Ketches that they were also deceived and that the ransom has been transferred to others, but they have obtained the person's whereabouts. It is now known that there were formerly ten gangs of bandits who planned to use this kidnapping case to extort money from Colonel Lindbergh.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, San Rafael, California, 16th: Robert Dollar, the old owner of the Dollar Shipping Company, passed away today at the age of eighty-eight. Dollar worked hard throughout his life. Not long ago, he still traveled to the East. After returning to the country, he was bedridden for some time before recovering. Unexpectedly, he fell ill again this time and passed away. Dollar was born in Falkirk, Scotland. He first entered elementary school and left school at the age of eleven. He then went to Canada, and at the age of thirteen, he worked as a hired hand on a timber farm. Later he came to the United States, and it was not until April 1888, at the age of forty-four, that he became a U.S. citizen. He lived in San Francisco and made a profit from foreign trade and the lumber industry, eventually becoming one of the world's great shipping magnates. Years ago, he changed Dollar Shipping to the World Line, and the business flourished. Later, he built two of the largest American merchant ships, the President Hoover and the President Coolidge. Dollar was a great traveler and continued to travel even in his later years. At the age of eighty, he still took air tours. After many years away from his hometown, Dollar once returned to visit. His comrades in Scotland presented him with the freedom of the city of Falkirk. Dollar was also a freeman of New York and Boston.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Athens, 16th: The French company's new large merchant ship Georges Philippar, carrying 600 passengers from the Far East, suddenly encountered disaster a few miles from Cape Gata Fui. It has now been abandoned. It is reported that several passengers were seriously injured in the fire. It is not yet known if there were any fatalities. At 5:45 this morning (local time), the ship sent out a distress signal, and all nearby ships rushed to the rescue, including the Soviet merchant ship "Kenifort," the British merchant ship "Masout," the British Steamship Company's "Kaisereihint," the Eastern Company's "Waterland," and a Japanese merchant ship. The first three ships to arrive used lifeboats and rafts to rescue many passengers. At that time, the captain of the wrecked ship had decided to abandon the ship. The Japanese ship saw an empty lifeboat en route. It is not known whether the people in the boat were killed. Later, we received a telegram stating that the merchant ship "Kontrelektor" rescued 129 people and the "Masout" rescued 134 people and sailed to Athens. The captain of the wrecked ship was also rescued and is on the Soviet merchant ship. That merchant ship and the remaining ships rescued many people, but the details have not yet been received. Another telegram stated that two sailors escaped onto a raft and are feared to have drifted away. (It is reported that the wrecked French ship sailed from Shanghai to Europe on April 23.)</p>

<p>▲ Opinion of the New Chairman of the Council, Madariaga ▲ If Japan Has Objections, Consult The Hague Judicial Tribunal ▲ Nagoya Shimbun says that the League of Nations Council has different interpretations of the interim report of the investigation committee chairman, Lytton, and Japan, and it is feared that disputes will be unavoidable in the future of the meeting. That is, Japan absolutely does not allow the League of Nations to interfere in the Manchuria issue and opposes the League of Nations citing Article 15 of the Covenant, while the Council will transfer Lytton's interim report to the General Assembly for resolution. However, regarding the relationship between the powers of the General Assembly and the Council, there are differences of opinion within the League of Nations. Secretary-General Drummond has communicated his own interpretation in the form of a memorandum to all parties. The content is quite unfavorable to Japan. Therefore, Japanese representative Nagaoka is striving for the League of Nations to carefully consider and implement Japan's claims. ▲ Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun says that the new chairman of the League of Nations Council, Madariaga, transferred the first report of the League of Nations investigation team to the General Assembly for discussion. If Japan raises objections, the Council will consult the International Court of Justice in The Hague for its ruling. The League of Nations believes that this procedure is legal in view of the internal atmosphere of the Hague Court. However, it is generally observed that the investigation team's report has no substantial significance, and Japan will certainly not take any actions that will cause more disputes.

<h3 id="e81">Inspection Record of Shanhaiguan <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>▲The Course of Japanese Provocation ▲Conversation with Brigade Commander He</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping: Since the 7th, Japanese troops have been firing cannons and guns day and night in Shanhaiguan, which has effectively become a very serious situation, as Shanhaiguan is the gateway to Pingjin. Since the signing of the agreement in Shanghai, the Japanese have wanted to shift their forces to the Northeast, so they intend to occupy Shanhaiguan. Regarding this tense situation and its progression, our reporter went to investigate and records the details as follows. The reporter departed from Ping on the BeiNing Railway train at 8:00 p.m. on the 10th. Upon arriving in Tianjin, more than ten Japanese soldiers boarded the train, including four in plainclothes. The armed Japanese soldiers searched the entire train, as if looking for something, causing unease among all the passengers. The next morning at 7:00 a.m., the train arrived in Qinhuangdao. The Japanese flag flew over the south platform, and armed Japanese soldiers showed their fierce faces, staring at the passengers. It is said that four Japanese warships did arrive at the Qinhuangdao seaside pier the day before yesterday, including one aircraft carrier. Its 300 marines landed the day before yesterday and went to Shanhaiguan on foot. Last night, they returned from Shanhaiguan, some stationed on the warship and some in the barracks. Unfortunately, the train only stopped for about ten minutes in Qinhuangdao, so it was not possible to investigate the local situation. Before the train departed, more Japanese soldiers boarded and followed the train to Shanhaiguan. At 8:10 a.m., the train arrived at Shanhaiguan Station. The reporter got off the train to inspect the situation at the station. As soon as I arrived at the station building, I saw the large sign of the pseudo Fengshan Railway station building hanging on the wall. Kan Duo, the head of the pseudo railway bureau, posted a notice with the date "April 12, Datong Year 1" at the end. Looking at the uniforms of the police in the station, although they were no different from (BeiNing), the cap badges had been replaced with pseudo national emblems. Our country's BeiNing Railway station building is in the west. Passengers who want to take the train to buy tickets must ask someone for directions. After passing the overpass, I saw a white cloth banner of more than ten feet hanging next to the waiting room, which read "(Manchukuo Border Surveillance Police Team Branch)." There were policemen dressed as armed Japanese soldiers in the station, with two people stationed at each post, wearing a golden bell on their hats, black riding boots, and holding new-style rifles. Listening to their accents, most of them were Japanese, but there were also a dozen or so Chinese. The pseudo-national police came from Jinzhou and forcibly occupied the BeiNing Railway station building. After negotiations by the general section chief Kou Bin, the pseudo-national police moved to the middle platform. In short, the order of the station is very chaotic, because there are three types of police in the station. In fact, the pseudo Fengshan Railway occupies more than one-third of the station building. Our service personnel are in a state of tyrannical and unreasonable behavior, and can only swallow their anger. The police sent by the pseudo-country are not limited to the station, and sometimes go to the South Gate, so there are many Japanese residents in the section from the station to the South Gate, and there are two hotels, Yamato and Daito, which specialize in accommodating Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese traitors. In the South Gate, there is a Japanese military police team, with barbed wire covering the four walls. Inside the gate are piles of sacks about ten feet high, with machine guns mounted on them. Many Japanese in plain clothes enter and exit, and their actions are suspicious. Japanese soldiers carry pistols and travel in groups of three or five in the streets. When they see Chinese soldiers, they glare at them. There are four soldiers of the Ninth Brigade guarding the South Gate of Shanhaiguan, dressed neatly. He Zhuguo, the commander of the Ninth Brigade, lives in front of the Education Bureau in the city. On the screen wall of the brigade headquarters are four large characters "(Mountains and Rivers Confront)," written by He himself. Each city gate in the city has soldiers of the Ninth Brigade guarding it, and the situation is no different from the past. The local security of Shanhaiguan is the responsibility of He Zhuguo, County Magistrate Li Shufan, and Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Baozhen. The cause of this outrageous action by the Japanese army was Matsushita, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Yushu. Last month, he heard that Brigade Commander He's subordinates had captured a thief. Matsushita said that the thief was a volunteer army and demanded that he be extradited for Japanese punishment. At that time, He Zhuguo happened to be in Beiping. The Japanese forced the extradition, interrogated him, and released him. At the same time, Matsushita used the excuse of the Boxer Protocol to claim that if railways, electric wires, and buildings were damaged within two English miles of the BeiNing Line near Shanhaiguan and Luanxian, the troops stationed in each country could arrest them. Therefore, he wanted to use this to stop the activities of the volunteer army. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, at 4:00 p.m., he took a prepared agreement to the brigade headquarters to see Brigade Commander He, limiting He to sign it immediately. The content stated that the Japanese army and navy had the right to directly arrest and detain in order to prevent the volunteer army from operating in Chinese territory, and made considerable explanations regarding the garrison from Shanhaiguan to Luanzhou. Brigade Commander He saw that this matter was important and sternly refused. Because He refused to sign, Matsushita went to the county government with Staff Officer Miura to see County Magistrate Li Shufan and made the same request. County Magistrate Li also refused, and Matsushita returned angrily. On the 5th, the pseudo Fengshan Railway train suddenly transported more than 200 people from Jinzhou, Korea, and lived in Yamato and Daito, so rumors spread in Yuguan. At 11:00 p.m. on the 7th, a Japanese armored train with more than 80 Japanese soldiers and police officers arrived at a location four or five miles away from Shanhaiguan and suddenly fired live ammunition with pistols for about half an hour, causing great panic among the residents of the city. Brigade Commander He went to the southeast corner of the city to inspect the situation. Before long, the Japanese armored train drove away. The next morning, Brigade Commander He sent someone to question the Japanese side. The Japanese side said it was a night drill. At 4:00 p.m. on the 8th, 70 Japanese police officers threw hand grenades in the southeast of Shanhaiguan City, and there was a constant booming sound. From 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on the 9th, the Japanese army fired live ammunition outside Dongguan again. At 9:30 a.m., they switched to machine guns. At that time, all the people in the city heard the sound of machine guns. At 11:00 p.m. that night, Hirata, the captain of the Japanese military police team outside the South Gate, led his subordinates to fire guns in the barracks, also using live ammunition. Immediately, several Japanese military police officers suddenly rushed out of the barracks with small pistols and rushed to the outside of the South Gate. One of the Japanese military police officers spoke Chinese and wanted to see Brigade Commander He, saying that there was an urgent matter to discuss. Our guarding soldiers were ordered to remain calm, so the Japanese military police rushed to the city without firing a shot, fortunately not causing any incidents. On the 10th, the Japanese military and police were slightly silent, so there was no shelling or shooting. Also, on the 9th, Japanese soldiers appeared in the Lijiabao Mayingzi area outside Jiukoukou and threw hand grenades. Seeing that the disruption plan was unsuccessful, the Japanese asked Brigade Commander He Zhuguo to give up Jiukoukou in Shanhaiguan and let the Japanese army garrison it. At the same time, Japanese troops were stationed near Shimenzhai in Jiukoukou. He politely refused. Early on the 11th, a Japanese train with about 400 soldiers arrived at the former station. After getting off the train, they advanced towards Jiukoukou. The actions have not yet received an accurate report. The Japanese barracks south of the railway have been building trenches and repairing fortresses for days, with barbed wire nets installed around the barracks. There are short cannons in the trenches, with the gun jackets removed, and the muzzles facing the South Gate of Shanhaiguan. The Japanese military strength in Shanhaiguan is about 400 to 500 people. It is found that if our side has to implement self-defense in response to this provocative action by Japan, the entire city will be devastated. The local authorities have also studied countermeasures and formed a special police team with police in the city to maintain the security of the South Gate, because the area is close to the Japanese army and is most prone to misunderstandings. This special police force has been on duty the day before yesterday. He Zhuguo and Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Shishen ordered special protection for Japanese residents to prevent the Japanese from having any excuses. However, the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Shenyang and the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Army Headquarters have sent Japanese military officers to Yuguan secretly for several days. Their actions are very noteworthy. It is said that the purpose of the Japanese side is to make every effort to quell the north of Manchuria, but in order to consolidate the gateway to the rear, Shanhaiguan is essential. If it cannot be occupied, there is a risk that the rear will be constrained. Therefore, the situation in Shanhaiguan is getting tighter every day. After the reporter entered the city, he visited He Zhuguo at his private residence and asked about the situation of defending the territory and his personal aspirations for the future. He said the following: "(Since the September 18th Incident, Shanhaiguan has been in an unusually important position. Matsushita, the captain of the Japanese garrison, previously made unreasonable demands to prevent the activities of the volunteer army, forcing me to sign and intimidating me with harsh words. As a soldier, I only know how to defend the territory, so I refused immediately. The Japanese army then used the trick of using exercises to disturb the local area. I negotiated to stop it on the one hand, and on the other hand, I gave special protection to Japanese residents. Our troops are stationed in the city, and the soldiers guarding the gate are responsible for training with experience. There are about 80 pseudo-national police officers who have arrived in Shanhaiguan. They stated in advance that they were here to maintain the order of the Fengshan Road. Now they have gone beyond the scope, and I have negotiated with the Japanese side based on reason. As for the future, I only know that I have a country and do not consider anything else. Regarding the Japanese army firing guns, because it affects local security, I am negotiating with the Japanese side, and it may be resolved." He has very strict requirements for his subordinates, so he has a very good relationship with the local people. After the reporter said goodbye, he went inside and outside the city to investigate the social situation. It is reported that merchants are leaving because the Japanese army is causing trouble, but business is as usual. South Gate Street is more lively, and most of the shoppers are railway workers. Most of the shops are restaurants, and they usually sell pot stickers. There are vendors selling prawns everywhere, and you can buy six or seven for each corner. According to the shrimp vendors, the prawns are all shipped from Andong Yingkou, and the value is very cheap, so people who buy prawns are also enthusiastic. South Gate Street is slightly inferior to South Gate in terms of commerce, with more transactions in rice and grain. The county government is inside the South Gate, and the houses are dilapidated. The East Gate is (The First Pass Under Heaven). Under the pass is the Tian Family Elementary School, which is slightly larger in scale and run by Tanaka Gyoku. Looking from the city tower, you can see Mount Jue opposite, 30 miles away from the pass, towering into the clouds. Inside the First Pass Under Heaven tower, there is still a large area of square, and the characters are more majestic than those hanging outside. It is said that the one in the house is the true pen, and the outside is Yingding. Following the city road south, Qiufeng Pavilion is next to the city. At the battlements of the city, there are four or five guards. From the city, you can see the pseudo-Manchu flag next to the railway. After getting off the city tower, I went to the Education Bureau. The rural normal school and county middle school run by the bureau are located in the bureau, with a total of four or five hundred students, of which more than one hundred are normal school students, all wearing light brown uniforms, and are energetic. During the Japanese army's artillery exercises, classes were held as usual. Shanhaiguan Station has a Rotary School, and the students are all children of railway employees. Recently, the school authorities have planned to move the school into the city because the order in the station is very chaotic. Because of the current situation, very few students go to school.

<p>▲Red bandits Attempt to Disturb Guangdong's Pingyuan Territory ▲Guangdong Side Uncovers Reddening Three Provinces Plan</p>
<p>A dispatch from Shantou: The main force of the Fujian southern communist bandits has recently moved south from Changting to the area between Longyan and Nanjing, with a tendency to move to the Jiangxi border of Xunwu and overlook Pingyuan. Therefore, after the Guangdong army recovered Yongding and Shanghang, it also focused on the Jiangxi border, and it was not convenient to go deep into western Fujian. Yesterday, the Shantou Third Army Office received a telegram from Huang Zhiwen, the commander of the Pingyuan Eighth Division, stating that the bandits who attacked the Fen Shuiqiu camp yesterday (the 10th) were the entire 36th Division of the Pseudo 12th Army (Deng Zihui) and the Red Guard local communists, totaling about 3,000 people, with machine guns and repeating cannons. After I dispatched Chen Tuanfu and Peng Ying to assist, the bandits were completely repelled at 2:00 p.m. More than 60 bandits were killed, more than 100 were injured, one bandit was captured, and four rifles were seized. According to the captured prisoner, the Red bandits who went to Xunwu on the 2nd included the entire 36th Division of the Pseudo 12th Army, totaling 106, 107, and 108 three battalions, and the First and Second Independent Divisions. Each battalion of the 36th Division has three infantry companies and one machine gun company, with more than 80 people in each company and more than 70 guns, with 150 rounds of ammunition for each gun. The bandit transfer to Xunwu has the intention of invading Pingyuan to disturb the rear of our army entering Fujian. Currently, the entire Qiu Ying company is stationed in Fen Shuiqiu, and one company each of Peng Ying and Zhang Ying, and the rest are stationed in Bao Cheng. Today (the 11th), the bandits will attack again, and the number of people will increase compared to yesterday. The rest will be reported later, etc. Also, Huang Zhiwen's telegram on the 8th stated that he had just received a telephone report from Regiment Commander Ye Shouyao, stating that the bandits who attacked Fen Shuiqiu last night had been in contact from 10:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. this morning, and then retreated to Xunwu County on the Jiangxi border. It was found that the number of bandits who attacked this time was only more than 200, and the purpose was actually to harass. As a result, our side injured one squad leader, captured one bandit, and seized one gun, etc. According to the above observations, the Guangdong army entering Fujian has already been in contact with the bandits on the Jiangxi border. The bandits on the side of the Jiangxi border will not be cleared without going deep into the Fujian border. The Chao and Shantou areas are still defended by the Independent Second Division Zhang Ruigui's troops. Zhang and the division's special service battalion arrived in Shantou on the 8th. According to Zhang's interview with the reporter, although the division headquarters moved to Shantou, a part of the officials still stayed in Chaoyang to handle the aftermath of Nanshan. When the division first entered Nanshan, it found small groups of communist bandits. Once they were suppressed, they would disperse and disappear, suspected of fleeing elsewhere. Unexpectedly, the bandits were cunning and hid deep in the mountains. The officers and soldiers were unfamiliar with the place and were often attacked. Later, they changed their plan, surrounded the entire mountain, cut off their food supply, and blocked their news transmission. Every day, they sent sentries and spies to scout around. As soon as they saw the bandits, they would send teams to suppress them. In the past two months, there have been hundreds of battles, large and small. All the large groups of communist bandits have been scattered and eliminated by seven or eight out of ten. The organ of the Pseudo Dongjiang Military Commission was seized in the mountains, and important documents and plans were found. The content was to prepare for an internal response from the Jiangxi bandits and set the uprising at the end of March (more than ten days after Zhang's division entered the suppression), and first capture Chaoyang, Puning, Huilai, Jieyang, Chaoan, Shantou, and Chenghai. All the organizations were quite sophisticated. That is, the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province invaded Zhangzhou and stationed troops in Changting, and there were also liaison operations. Fortunately, they took the initiative to attack and broke the bandit's nest, so that the bandits could not cause trouble (the 12th).</p>
<h3 id="e84">Zhengyang Plundered by Bandits <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>▲Central Government Sends Troops to Suppress ▲Rumor Says Bandits Have Fled to Bengbu</p>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu: After the bandits on the Anhui border captured Zhengyang, they plundered wantonly. Many firearms were confiscated from the local garrison and Tuan Police, and several merchants and civilians were killed. When the bandits first entered the street, there were only a few hundred people, and the residents who fled were like a tide. Fortunately, Yu Yumen, the head of the town's security group, led the team to cover the retreat, saving many refugees. However, there were too many refugees, and they were in a panic to cross the river. Many people were squeezed into the water and drowned. Yu arrived in Bengbu yesterday, and his troops suffered slight losses. Niu Youchen, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, also escaped safely. Shou Zhen people in Bengbu, in view of the spread of the Red disaster and the suffering of their hometowns, have been telegraphing the central government for days to request troops to assist in the suppression. The Military Commission has ordered the First Division Hu Zongnan, the Fourth Division Xu Tingyao, and the Independent 33rd Brigade Tang Yunshan to rush to suppress the bandits. The advance station soldiers of the Fourth Division arrived in Bengbu yesterday, and most of the troops will continue to arrive from Pukou within days, and will go west along Huaihe. The First Division will go to Anqing and advance from Tongcheng Shucheng to Hefei, turning to Liuan to join the troops of Chen Tiaoyuan Wang Jun, etc. to suppress the bandits. The 33rd Brigade has already started from Henan and is rushing into Anhui. The Bengbu Office of the Independent 40th Brigade of the Army here received a wireless telegraph from Li Ruian, the chief of staff of the brigade, from Huoqiu last night, saying that the advance troops of the 718th Regiment of the brigade were in fierce battle with the Red bandits near Zhengyang. I personally led the 720th Regiment to advance and surround the Red bandits. Huoqiu was guarded by a part of the 718th Regiment, together with the county police preparation camp Sun Peiji's troops, etc. The bandits once approached Thirty Li Pu in Shouxian. Zhu Dexin, the chairman of the Shouxian Chamber of Commerce, telegraphed the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce again last night, begging for troops to assist. It is reported that the bandit suppression army has been in contact with the bandits near Shouxian, and the fighting is fierce. Ni Rongxian, the commander-in-chief of the militia, also ordered the troops from Fuyang to go to Zheng and attack the Red bandits. Ni arrived in Fengtai last night. According to a military agency receiving a telegram from Fengtai, the bandits in Zhengyang have already withdrawn, taking away many hostages when they left. The local losses were very heavy. According to refugees from Zheng to Bengbu, the bandits searched and plundered a lot of silver dollars, rice, and salt, and loaded them on boats, with the intention of taking them away. The copper coins and flour that were searched and plundered were distributed to the poor, etc. Approximately, the bandits saw that the armies and militias from all sides were attacking Zhengyang, and the number of people was small and it was difficult to resist, so they carried out a large-scale looting and left. As for Shouying</p>

<p>Feng Huai and other counties, although they were tense a few days ago, are now all peaceful. The military and police authorities here have stepped up security these days. The city has been under martial law from 10:00 p.m. every night. Pedestrians are not allowed to pass without a password. The ground security responsibility is borne by the troops of Zeng Wanzhong of the 12th Division. Local people, due to the suspension of the Chamber of Commerce and the lack of responsible people, specially organized a joint meeting of all local circles, and 29 people were elected from the business, agriculture, industry, education, and industry sectors to jointly be responsible for maintaining everything (the 14th).

<p>▲Doctor Cheats and Rapes Female Teacher</p>
<p>A female teacher from a certain girls' school behind Puzhao Temple in the city is quite sociable and has been engaged to a certain Song. The two are deeply in love and visit frequently. Unable to restrain themselves, they secretly conceived. The woman, seeing her belly gradually growing, felt it was very inappropriate and sought ways to eliminate it. She met a Hakka western doctor, Wu, somewhere and discussed it with him. Unexpectedly, the doctor had been coveting her for a long time and readily agreed to take on the task. One night, he asked the woman to go for a diagnosis. When she arrived, he pretended that the hospital room was too small and led her to open room number five in a hotel. Under the pretext of diagnosing the uterus, he induced the woman to undress and lie on her back. The doctor then intimidated her to keep silent and carried out his rape. The woman's will was weak and she fell into his trap, feeling extremely frustrated. She returned to school in tears the next morning. This matter was gradually heard by her fiancé, who came to the school to investigate, and the drama of the female teacher being deceived and raped by a doctor was exposed. It is unknown how this case will end in the future.</p>

<p>| and Standards for Expenditure | The Education Department of Jiangsu Province, under orders, believes that in this time of national crisis, all expenses should be reduced as much as possible so that we can overcome difficulties together. Therefore, it has revised the organizational regulations of the education bureaus of various counties, as well as the classification standards and expenditure table, and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for review and record. It is found that the expenditures of provincial schools and social education institutions under the jurisdiction of this department have always been paid from the provincial education expenditure. How the budget should be reduced should be discussed and implemented by the Education Expenditure Committee. The education bureaus of the remaining counties are responsible for managing the educational administration of the entire county. Although their nature belongs to administration, their internal organization and external measures are very different from those of other county bureaus. Therefore, although austerity is an important goal, the methods of austerity cannot be the same as those of other county bureaus. Moreover, education is an important foundation for the country, and it should be vigorously expanded to achieve universal coverage. We must not give up eating for fear of choking, causing criticism of being stuck in the mud. Moreover, the education funds of various counties mostly have special funds, and the independence of education funds has been repeatedly ordered in recent years, which is very different from other administrative expenses that affect the provincial treasury. Therefore, the way to reduce expenses should start with saving administrative expenses. All redundant personnel and wasteful expenses that do not contribute to practical work should be strictly eliminated. Other expenses that are indeed used for business purposes should remain as they are, so as not to hinder future development. With this method, the intention of attaching importance to education can still be implied in the act of complying with official orders. This department has revised the original organizational regulations of the education bureaus of various counties in this province based on this purpose, and revised the classification standards and expenditure table for the expenses that should be paid by the education bureaus of various counties, referring to the actual situation, so as to follow. As for the education bureaus of various counties, except for Gaoyou and other four counties that have been changed to education sections due to flood disasters, the remaining ones are planned to continue to set up bureaus to take special responsibility. The said regulations and standards have been approved by the 489th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. In addition to the case, the reasons for the austerity method, along with a copy of the draft regulations and the classification standards and expenditure table, are submitted with the text, hoping to be reviewed and filed for record. After receiving the submission, the Ministry of Education yesterday consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government to instruct the Education Department, saying that the standard original regulations, etc., are generally not inappropriate and can be filed for record. However, the words (temporary) should be added above the words regulations in the original title, and the words (to be selected by the bureau director and submitted to the county government for transfer to the education department for approval and appointment) should be added above Article 6 and Article 7 (whose regulations are to be determined separately).</p>

<p>Ding Jianzhi, the former director of the Education Bureau of Pei County, has been out of office for a long time. More than 17,000 yuan of the cash that should be handed over during his term of office and more than 6,000 yuan of overspent and inflated accounts have not been handed over or accounted for. The county magistrate and the new director of the county have twice scheduled meetings to calculate and urge the handover, but he has repeatedly avoided and hidden for excuses. Yesterday, the Education Department received successive telegrams from the county magistrate and the director of the Education Bureau presenting the previous situation. At the same time, according to Zhu and others in the education sector of the county, Ding Jianzhi has been hiding in the City Hotel in the provincial capital, requesting that he be detained and escorted back to Pei County for liquidation in order to attach importance to education funds. The Education Department then sent personnel to investigate and found that the former director still had term deposits in Tongchangyi, Qin Yanshoutang, Yilong Company, and Xinpei Bookstore and other stores, totaling nearly 10,000 yuan, which he could not pay immediately. Therefore, the former director was temporarily taken into custody and handed over to Zhenjiang County for escort back to Pei County for liquidation, and the county magistrate of Pei County was ordered by the department to comply.

<p>Report on the situation of yesterday's takeover</p>
<p>Joint committee supervises the handover. Japanese troops leave; our police take over defense. Zhabei, occupied by Japanese forces for over two months, is now being returned following the signing of the ceasefire agreement. The Japanese side has agreed to first withdraw from a portion of Zhabei, south of Suzhou Creek, west of Jinghu Road, and east of Guangzhao Road, encompassing a circumference of approximately seven li. This area comprises the Fourth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, as well as its First and Second Sub-stations. After inspecting the area the day before yesterday, our side arranged for the handover to take place at 8:00 AM on the 16th. Accordingly, yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, Police Captain Huang Ming and Fourth District Chief Wu Shaolin, along with Joint Committee member Yu Hongjun, Police Captain Huang Ming,</p>
<p>led police officers and the Beiping Security Team to take over. Following the takeover, the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Zhabei Office was established, and household registration surveys commenced.

Today, personnel will be dispatched at 1:00 PM to take over Dachang, and Zhenru and Pengpu Towns are scheduled for takeover on the 20th, with the area north of the Jinghu Railway in Zhabei to be taken over on the 21st. Details are recorded separately below.  ▲Departure Situation Our takeover personnel assembled at the Lianshe and departed at 7:30 AM yesterday. Simultaneously, 300 members of the Security Team transferred from Beiping, led by Commander Lu Lu, arrived at the Municipal Public Security Bureau at 6:15 AM. Together with Police Captain Huang Ming and Chief Inspector Gong Xikui of the Public Security Bureau, they departed in five patrol cars from the Bureau and ten trucks from a Chinese moving company, braving the rain. They proceeded via North Zhonghua Road, entering Minguo Road, passing Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, heading west on Edinburgh Road, turning north onto Tongfu Road in the Public Concession, entering Carter Road, and arriving at Hengfeng Road Bridge (i.e., New Sampan Factory Bridge) to meet. At 7:45 AM, they reached the Police Training School on Republican Road and began deploying defenses.  ▲Supervision of Handover Public Security Bureau Chief Inspector Gong Xikui arrived at the headquarters of the 5th Battalion of the Japanese Military Police on Xinmin Road at 7:50 AM. Japanese Secretary Yin Tixin coordinated with the Japanese side, and by 8:00 AM, Director Wen Yingsheng, accompanied by neutral representatives, American Lieutenant Colonel Tranda and Lieutenant Suler, arrived at Zhabei Headquarters in one car. Japanese representatives Major General Uematsu, Colonel Sugisaka, Commander Katsuno, and others were present. Wen, along with two advisors, went out to inspect Guangzhao Road, Xinmin Road, and other areas for a week before returning to headquarters, by which time it was 8:30 AM. Officers Kohara Yu 9 and Odamura from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters handed over the inventory to our representatives for review. The inventory consisted of all items within the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce (now the Japanese Military Police Battalion Headquarters) occupied by Japanese soldiers. After inspection by our representatives, they signed the document. The inventory consisted of two Japanese books. The Japanese version was signed by Katsuno Minoru, Commander of the 5th Battalion of the Japanese Military Police, who wrote four characters (meaning "the items listed on the right are handed over") after the Japanese inventory. Below that, he wrote "May 16, Showa 7, Katsuno Minoru, Commander of the 5th Battalion of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Force." Our side, represented by Police Captain Huang Ming, signed after the Chinese inventory, stating "Received without error, May 16, 21st year of the Republic of China, Huang Ming, Captain of the Police Brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau." After both parties signed and stamped, the handover procedure was completed. Everyone was very pleased and took a commemorative photograph at the Japanese Military Police Battalion Headquarters.  ▲Japanese Address After the handover ceremony was completed, Lieutenant Colonel Tranda congratulated both Chinese and Japanese representatives on the success of the peace. The representatives shook hands in greeting. Subsequently, Japanese Colonel Sugisaka delivered a speech in Japanese to both sides, which was translated by our Yin Tixin. He stated, "The Japanese troops' advance into Zhabei was a necessary measure to protect overseas residents. Now, due to the ceasefire agreement, we are complying with the agreement and returning the occupied area. Japan and China are neighboring countries in East Asia, and we hope to promote goodwill from now on and further increase the prosperity of Zhabei." Everyone applauded and dispersed at 9:05 AM.  ▲Japanese Troops Withdraw At the sound of the military bugle, the Japanese troops formed ranks, turned north on Xinmin Road, and took Datong Road, crossing the railway to depart. The Fourth and Fifth Battalions, except for some units that had already left, numbered three to four hundred who departed yesterday morning. Three Japanese naval armored cars also cleared the way. At 9:30 AM, the Japanese troops completely left the area taken over by our side.  ▲Our Police Enter Zhabei The Beiping Security Team of our side arrived in Zhabei at 7:45 AM, initially with 250 men.

The iron gates at the Xinjiang Road intersection, Menggu Road intersection, New Zhabei Bridge, and Wuzhen Bridge have not yet been opened by the concession authorities, so passage is still not possible. Yesterday, upon hearing the news, people from all sides came to visit one after another, and many residents of Zhabei also went to inspect their homes.

<p>▲Dai Ji's Reply to Wang Xiaolai's Letter Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, because after the signing of the Shanghai ceasefire agreement, Japanese newspapers reported that the agreement included a clause with strict restrictions on the Chinese troop deployments in Pudong and south of Suzhou Creek,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>on the 9th of this month, during a meeting, he met with Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji and inquired about the truth. Dai immediately denied the matter. After Wang returned to the Chamber, he translated the newspaper reports and sent them to Dai, requesting him to provide an explanation. At the time, he also telegraphed the Executive Yuan of the National Government, requesting it to announce whether there were any other secret annexes to the ceasefire agreement besides the published documents, in order to dispel the initial doubts of the public. The next day, he received a reply from Executive Yuan President Wang, stating that there were no other secret documents. The day before yesterday, he received a formal reply letter from Commander Dai, explaining that he had rejected the Japanese side's inquiry during the meeting. The original letters between Wang and Dai are as follows:  ▲Wang Xiaolai's Letter to Dai Ji Commander Xiaokun, I was very pleased with our recent conversation. After returning to the Chamber, I immediately translated the news about the Shanghai troop deployment issue published in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on May 3rd and the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun on May 5th and sent them to you for your review. Outside misunderstandings may have arisen from this, and it seems that the authorities should provide some explanation to dispel public doubts. I hope you will consider this and respond. With best wishes, Wang Xiaolai bows, May 9th, 2:00 PM. (Attached copies) (1) Troop deployment issue published in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on May 3rd: The issue of Chinese troop deployment in Pudong and south of Suzhou Creek, resolved by the Military Expert Committee on the 2nd, has been completely resolved. The gist is as follows: With the consent of the Chinese representatives, it was recorded in the meeting agenda that (Chinese troops around Shanghai are not allowed to take any military action, and neutral military officers are responsible for this). The document was sealed by military officers from various countries. Regarding Pudong in front of the Yangshupu Military Headquarters, the Chinese representatives provided written proof that no troops would be stationed in that area, and that no troops would be stationed in that area until Japan withdrew its troops. The above was recorded in writing and delivered to the Japanese representatives, and the minutes of the meeting were jointly sealed by military officers from various countries. This is the point where the troop deployment issue was resolved. Furthermore, Chinese troops are strictly prohibited from entering or exiting northern Pudong, regardless of the purpose. The same newspaper also reported that regarding the ceasefire agreement, the Chinese side had stated that they would not enter or exit south of Suzhou Creek and Pudong. The Japanese military believed that regarding the opposite bank of the Shanghai Concession in northern Pudong, regardless of the purpose, the Chinese side acknowledged that they would not enter or exit, recording the term (matter of understanding). (2) The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on May 5th, regarding the troop deployment issue after the Shanghai ceasefire, as follows: (Chinese troops are not allowed to enter or exit the area 20 kilometers from Shanghai, so Japanese troops should also withdraw from the designated area. This is a great success for Japanese diplomacy. On the one hand, it will further convene a round table conference in the form of a chart.)  ▲Dai Ji's Reply to Wang Xiaolai's Letter Mr. Xiaolai, I have received and respectfully read your letter and the attached translation of the Japanese newspaper report. I am deeply grateful for your concern. However, the scope of this ceasefire conference was limited to the cessation of acts of war and the procedures for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. All issues of a political nature were not discussed. The government has repeatedly stated and the chief representative has assumed responsibility for this. In principle, I should not provide further explanation. However, I am in a difficult position and appreciate your attention, so I dare to tell you what I know. Regarding the sections cited in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, I can responsibly assert that they are completely untrue. Moreover, Vice Minister Guo has repeatedly stated that the actions of the Chinese army are absolutely not subject to any restrictions under the agreement. As for the statement that no troops are allowed to be stationed in Pudong and south of Suzhou Creek, the Japanese side has never made such a request. However, during the meeting, the Japanese side repeatedly inquired about the positions of our troops in Pudong and the South City. Because it was outside the scope of the meeting, our side refused. There is no such record in the agreement. Some people in the country do not examine the full text of the agreement, leading to misunderstandings. I hope you will use this information to correct the situation. In haste, I respectfully reply, wishing you good health, Dai Ji bows, May 13th.  ▲Wang Xiaolai's Reply to Dai Ji's Letter Commander Xiaokun, I have respectfully received your reply. The Japanese newspaper reports are all fictitious. I am very comforted and admired by your public spirit and loyalty to the country. In addition to publishing the exchange of letters to correct misunderstandings and dispel public doubts, I respectfully reply by letter, hoping for your understanding. With best wishes, Wang Xiaolai bows, May 16th.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Investigation of the Guo Assault Case Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲ Li Cishan and Four Others Appeared in Court　　▲ Released on Bail of 200 Yuan Each</p>
<p>Before the signing of the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, representatives from various organizations in the city rushed to the private residence of Guo Taiqi, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, on May 3rd to inquire about everything. During Guo's meeting with the representatives, a conflict arose, resulting in Guo sustaining a head injury. Subsequently, eleven people, including Li Cishan, were arrested by the French Concession police, and then released one after another, as previously reported. Now, because the government believes it is necessary to investigate this case thoroughly, the Shanghai Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office has notified the defendants to begin the investigation. The first hearing was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. Relevant parties in the case and the defendants' lawyers were present in court to be questioned. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Crowded Waiting Room</p>
<p>The hearing was originally scheduled to start at 9:00 AM yesterday, but due to the weekly memorial service held on Mondays, it was delayed and only commenced around 10:00 AM. Those summoned had already reported to the court by 8:30 AM, including Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Yang Rongwei, Shen Zurong, Ni Shichang, and four others. Xie Chengping was unable to return to Shanghai from Hangzhou in time and sent a telegram to his proxy lawyer, stating that he would return to Shanghai immediately to attend the hearing. However, due to the night train service between Shanghai and Hangzhou not yet being restored, he only arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM, and thus could not attend the hearing. The other five, Wu Gonghan, Jiang Chengda, Fan Xueqin, Jiang Yizhi, and Tian Yuanqi, were not summoned. In addition, three witnesses, the male and female servants of the Guo residence, Xu Aimei, A Ying, and Jin Sheng, also did not appear in court. The defendants' lawyers included Yu Zhongluo, Zhao [blank], and Lu Jizong, hired by the various organizations' National Salvation Joint Association, and Qu Yue, hired by Ni Shichang. Many reporters from various newspapers also attended to observe the proceedings. The lawyers' waiting room was crowded due to the small size of the room. Those who arrived later waited outside the room.</p>
<p>▲ Li Cishan's Testimony</p>
<p>The hearing was commenced by the Prosecutor's Office at 10:10 AM. Prosecutor Wu Xiaoge and Clerk Zhao Yifen presided over the hearing. First, Li Cishan was summoned and questioned about his age, address, and occupation. Then he was questioned about the May 3rd incident. Li stated that he was from Anhui, 46 years old, residing at 7 Da Tong Road, and worked as a lawyer. On that day, he went to visit Vice Minister Guo with Yin Zhiling, Yang Rongwei, and Xie Yongping. They went as representatives of the various organizations' National Salvation Joint Association, and he himself was a representative of the Lawyers' Association participating in the Joint Association. Because they frequently met with Vice Minister Guo, many of Guo's family members recognized them. Therefore, when entering, they did not present name cards. Only Mr. Yin presented a name card and handed it to the doorman, who passed it to a young maid to deliver inside. They followed in, and soon a boy came out and said that Vice Minister Guo was taking a bath in the bathroom. He asked if the guests could wait if they had nothing else to do, otherwise, they could leave. They replied that they came specially to visit and did not mind waiting. After waiting for about 35 to 40 minutes, Vice Minister Guo finally came downstairs. Vice Minister Guo entered the room and apologized for making them wait. Then, he stated his purpose to Guo, saying that he had seen in English and Japanese newspapers that the demands made by the Japanese side were quite serious, such as not stationing troops around Shanghai. Vice Minister Guo emphatically stated that he would never do anything that would betray the country and humiliate the nation. Upon hearing this, they felt relieved. At that time, the doorman again delivered name cards. Guo ordered them to be invited in. There were four people who came, three were representatives of the People's National Salvation Association, and one was a representative of the University Students' Federation. He recognized this person because he had been a representative of the various organizations' National Salvation Joint Association on the first day and had requested to see Vice Minister Guo. At that time, they asked Vice Minister Guo to show them the original Sino-English-Japanese agreement. Guo said yes. At the same time, Commander Dai Ji and Chief of Staff Huang Qiang arrived. Seeing that they were talking to Vice Minister Guo in the living room, they retreated to another living room because they were going to a meeting and needed to change uniforms. Guo then went to the room where Dai and Huang were, exchanged a few words, and then went upstairs to fetch the agreement to show them. The people from the public who came to the room kept arriving. The room was not large, and it became crowded. Not only was there no place to sit, but there was also little room to stand. The people who came later mostly stood in the corridor and courtyard. There were both men and women, but they didn't know how they came. After Guo entered the room, he stood by the mahogany round table and read the articles. The first article said, "(Stop all kinds of military actions around Shanghai)". The public was very angry about the phrase "(No troops stationed in Nanshi and Pudong)". Therefore, upon hearing the four words "(around Shanghai)", they thought that there was a particularly big problem, and suddenly there was a sound of accusation. He and Mr. Yin advised that they should not just focus on the first article "(Stop all kinds of military actions around Shanghai)" but should read the following articles. At that time, some people opposed their words, saying "(Go, go away)". Vice Minister Guo then read the English. Most of the people did not understand English, so no one understood Vice Minister Guo's English agreement. At that time, someone suddenly snatched the draft agreement held by Vice Minister Guo and went away. Then there was a sound of abuse, starting from the corner of the room. In a short while, someone threw a copper coin at his face. He only raised his arms to cover his head, hoping to avoid being affected. Prosecutor Wu asked if he knew the name of the person who first threw the copper coin. He replied that he did not know who it was and did not see who started throwing it, so he did not know the name or appearance of the person. When the fighting started, he tried hard to stop it, but no one responded. Then Guo was injured, and everyone dispersed, not knowing how they left. He asked who threw the teacup. He replied that he did not know. The situation was chaotic at the time, and it was impossible to see clearly. Moreover, he was trying to study the content of the articles and was paying attention to that, not to the other things. It is easy to recognize a few people in a room, but difficult to recognize dozens of people. It is easy to recognize acquaintances in a crowd, but difficult to recognize strangers. These people were all strangers and difficult to identify. He only saw three or four people throwing copper coins. Initially, he did not expect this to happen. He only knew after hearing the sound of the copper coins hitting things. In short, the occurrence of this unfortunate incident was due to Vice Minister Guo's bath. If they had met earlier, and he had read the articles and left, he might have been able to avoid this incident. Initially, Vice Minister Guo stood by the round table. When the draft was snatched away, he knew the situation was not good and retreated to the sofa chair, but he was already injured. He asked whether Guo Taiqi's injury was caused by a copper coin or a teacup. He replied that he did not know and would have to ask the doctor. He asked what they did after Guo Taiqi was injured. He replied that the attackers scattered. They waited in the small courtyard because he and Vice Minister Guo had a deep relationship. Now that he had suffered misfortune, they needed to hear the doctor's diagnosis to know the severity of the injury and increase his regret. Therefore, he had deeply comforted him. In short, he felt uneasy about the occurrence of this incident. Because Guo's residence was heavily guarded on weekdays, it was not easy for outsiders to enter. Because they went often, they were able to move freely. The doorman did not strictly check them because there were people inside, which led to this mess. He asked if there was anyone wearing a Zhongshan suit among the four people who entered Guo's residence. He replied no, only one person was wearing a suit. He asked who went out to call people in. He replied that they all sat in the room, waiting for Vice Minister Guo to bring the articles, and were eager to speak. No one went out. This matter was probably a misunderstanding. Because Guo had been handling Sino-Japanese negotiations and had been very satisfactory to them, he had argued strongly with the other party at the meeting. When the government announced that Vice Minister Guo was to be the ambassador to the UK, they sent a telegram to urge him to stay, fearing that successors would not be familiar with the situation or understand the matter as well as Guo, and earnestly asked him to wait until the Sino-Japanese negotiations were concluded before leaving. Later, when Guo resigned to the government, they also urged him to withdraw his resignation. When he returned from Nanjing, they were all very happy, showing their deep friendship. As for going to the French Concession police station, it was just for them to be witnesses to prove what had happened at that time. And the patrolmen came very late, about thirty minutes after the incident. Later, Vice Minister Guo ordered Secretary Deng and Xia Qifeng to go to the police station to bail him and Yin out.</p>
<p>▲ Yin Zhiling's Testimony</p>
<p>Then Yin Zhiling was questioned. He stated that he was 35 years old, from Jiangsu, residing at 517 Avenue Edward VII, and worked as a professor. His testimony was the same as Li Cishan's, except for the following differences: (1) The child who came out to answer was probably Vice Minister Guo's child, about seven or eight years old. (2) When the crowd argued about the "(around Shanghai)" issue, they had advised that they should not take it out of context and should listen to the whole article. (3) About three to five minutes after the incident, the doctor came and said that there was no major injury, that it had been washed and bandaged. (4) The police patrolmen only arrived thirty minutes later. Several reporters also arrived at that time. They had been talking to Commander Dai and others for a long time. (5) The police wanted them to go to testify about what had happened, so they went frankly. The rest was the same as Mr. Li's response.</p>
<p>▲ Yang Rongwei's Testimony</p>
<p>23 years old, from Hunan, residing at 4 Gas Fei Road, a Japanese student who returned to China after the Sino-Japanese incident. The prosecutor asked, "Did you see who actually hit Guo Taiqi?" He replied, "I don't know." He asked, "Was it one or two teacups that were thrown?" He replied, "I don't know." He asked, "After the hitting, was there one or two teacups on the ground?" He replied, "After the hitting, we all went to the opposite room to talk to Dai and Huang, so I don't know." He asked, "After the hitting, who directed everyone to leave?" He replied, "I don't know."</p>
<p>▲ Shen Zurong's Testimony</p>
<p>20 years old, from Hunan, a law student. On May 3rd, he represented the University Students' Federation to visit Vice Minister Guo. He met three other representatives on the way and went together, but he didn't know their names because they were representatives of two different groups. After they were seated, about twenty minutes later, the crowd rushed in. He did not see any of the other three going out to greet the crowd. During the assault, he quickly hid in a small door next to the living room, so he was not very clear about the situation.</p>
<p>▲ Yu Zhongluo's Statement</p>
<p>Yu Zhongluo, the defendant's representative lawyer, stood up and said, "May I ask the court, what report is this lawsuit based on?" Prosecutor Wu replied, "This case is based on Guo Taiqi's report on May 6th and this prosecutor's inquiry at Guo's residence on May 5th." Lawyer Yu said, "Is it the clerk's record?" Prosecutor Wu said, "Yes." Lawyer Yu then reported that three of the four representatives of the various organizations' National Salvation Joint Association had been summoned. Therefore, Xie Chengping, although he had not received a summons, suspected that he was summoned. Therefore, although Xie Chengping had gone to Hangzhou the day before, he had telegraphed to return to Shanghai to wait for questioning and had received a reply telegram, "(Returning immediately)". He asked the court to verify the telegram.</p>
<p>▲ Ni Shichang's Testimony</p>
<p>30 years old, from Shanghai, residing in the refugee camp at the intersection of Hed Road and Xin Zha Road, as a staff member of the camp. On May 3rd, because the camp needed a large amount of vegetables, he went to the Wang Family's vegetable garden in Fahua Town near Xujiahui to purchase vegetables to provide to the refugees. While walking on Rue Ferguson near Route Loullie, he heard someone shouting to stop. He looked back and saw that armed detectives were already beside him. When asked what was going on, they said to talk at the police station. He was then dragged into a large car and taken to the police station, which was baffling. Prosecutor Wu then summoned Li Cishan and asked, "Do you know this person?" Li said, "I have never seen this person. There was no such gentlemanly person in the crowd." (Note: Ni's clothing, a long gown and mandarin jacket, were both silk). I did not see him at the police station either. Yin Zhiling's testimony was the same as Li's. Li Rongwei said, "I hadn't seen this person before. I only saw Ni Shichang during the interrogation at the police station." Ni said that he was a staff member of the refugee camp of the Shanghai Local Maintenance Association. Pan Futang could testify and came to wait for questioning.</p>
<p>▲ Posting 200 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>After the interrogation, at about 11:30 AM, the prosecutor ordered the clerk to give the transcripts to the defendants to read and see if they were consistent, made slight requests for corrections, and signed their names separately. The prosecutor ordered them to wait for further summons. The defendants then went to post bail. The defense lawyers stood up and said that the defendants had no suspicion of anything and that they had all come to court today as summoned, and there was no risk of escape. They asked that they be exempted from posting bail. The prosecutor thought for a long time and ordered each to post a cash bail of 200 yuan. The defendants complied and posted 200 yuan bail each, obtained receipts, and dispersed. It was 12:30 PM. This case was filed for obstructing official duties, so it was investigated by the prosecutor. The police lawyers did not attend the court.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Two Assassination Cases at the Same Time <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲ Public Security Bureau Inspector Died　　▲ Real Estate Company Employee Suffered Misfortune　　▲ The Two Cases Occurred Very Close in Time　　▲ French Concession Police Paying Attention to the Two Murder Cases</p>
<p>At 1:30 PM yesterday, two major shooting cases occurred simultaneously in Yuan Cheng Li, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. The victims were Cao Qingcheng, the current inspector of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, and Jin Shoupei, an employee of Samsung Real Estate Company. Cao was shot three times in the head and died instantly. Jin was shot once in the back and sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. His life is still unpredictable. The details are described below.</p>
<p>▲ Former Party Department Officer</p>
<p>Cao Qingcheng, also known as Zhijian, was 24 years old, from Yangxin County, Hubei Province. He graduated from Yangxin Municipal Elementary School and had been in Shanghai for 12 years. Two years ago, he served as an officer in the Municipal Party Department and devoted himself to the labor movement. Later, he served as an inspector in the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Cao was diligent and cautious in his work and loyal to his duties, which was appreciated by the previous directors. His parents are both alive and well. His father's name is Yanwen, 70 years old, and his mother's maiden name is Hou, 67 years old. They live separately at 23 Kangti Road, French Concession, where they run a small-scale Hubei-style wonton noodle shop.</p>
<p>▲ One Wife and One Concubine</p>
<p>Cao himself lived in Yuan Cheng Li (formerly Shaoqing Li), 41 Lane 6, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. He had one wife, Jiao, from Hubei, 27 years old, and one concubine, Hu Yueying, a local, 22 years old. Jiao had two daughters, the eldest named Haisheng, 7 years old, and the second named Rongsheng, 4 years old. He also had an adopted daughter-in-law named Taosheng, also 4 years old (Hubei custom: those who are concerned about their health must first adopt a daughter-in-law). He had three siblings: the eldest brother, Maoheng, 45 years old, and the second brother, Maojun, 29 years old, were both in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Died After Being Shot Three Times</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Cao went to the bureau on time to work. After the bureau meeting, he returned to Yuan Cheng Li for lunch. After lunch, he leaned against the window to read the newspaper. At 1:15 PM, he glanced at the clock on the wall and called out to his concubine Hu, saying that it was late. He then actively got up and walked out of the alley. However, just as he reached Yongxing Lane 2, 184 Rue Galla, a young thug in a suit suddenly emerged from behind and shot Cao three times in the head, causing him to fall to the ground immediately and die with his brains splattered everywhere. Cao Qingcheng who was murdered</p>
<p>▲ Another Tragedy Occurred</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, the French Concession police immediately sent Western detectives to arrest the suspect. They also sent Cao's body to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road and then to the morgue of Tongren Fuyuan Branch to examine the body and report to the Second Special District Court for examination. At the same time, Cao's concubine Hu immediately invited Cao's parents and siblings to rush to the morgue to mourn the body, which was extremely tragic. Before long, the Supervision Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau also received the news and sent staff to investigate the truth of the incident. Unexpectedly, one wave subsided, and another rose again. Jin Shoupei, a native of Jiangwan who lived on the second floor of No. 25 in the same lane as Cao, was also shot by thugs at the same time.</p>
<p>▲ The Bullet Flew Just as He Turned Around</p>
<p>Jin was 33 years old and worked as an employee of Samsung Real Estate Company on Zilai Street, French Concession. Yesterday afternoon, after returning home for lunch, a friend named Xia Baosen came to visit around 1:00 PM. The two talked for about half an hour. At 1:15 PM, the friend said goodbye. Jin sent him out. The two walked and talked until they reached the entrance of the alley. They nodded and said goodbye. Unexpectedly, Jin had just turned around and hadn't taken a step when he suddenly heard a gunshot and felt the bullet hit him in the back. He fell to the ground in response. At that time, Jin's relative Wei Maomao happened to be nearby. Seeing this, he shouted loudly to catch the suspect. Guanlong police officer Qi Fengying also assisted in the pursuit. Jin Shoupei who was accidentally injured</p>
<p>▲ Replacing Zheng Instead of Cao</p>
<p>After the incident, the French Concession police received another report and sent detectives to the scene. They rushed Jin to the police station and then to Guangci Hospital. Because the injury was in a vital part of the body, his life was still unpredictable. According to eyewitnesses, the murderer was wearing blue cloth shirt and trousers. After firing the gun, he fled north. According to speculation, Cao was wearing a suit, and Jin was also wearing Western-style clothes. The two looked similar, so they were mistakenly identified by the thugs. However, according to Cao's family, Cao had a colleague named Zheng, who was always with Cao. The two also helped each other in handling official business. Since the thugs wanted to harm Cao, Zheng should also be noticed by those people. Jin was indeed accidentally injured, but in fact, he replaced Zheng instead of Cao.</p>
<p>▲ Police Pay Attention to This Case</p>
<p>Jin Shoupei's elderly mother is still alive. Mother Gu is 57 years old, and his wife Ding is 24 years old. His wife's younger sister also lives with them. Several members of the family depend on him for a living. Since the occurrence of this case, the French Concession authorities have attached great importance to it. In recent times, assassination cases have been constantly discovered in the French Concession, such as the murder of Cao Xiaoniupi on Xinxiao Bridge Street the night before last, and the recent assassination of Wang Bin, an inspector of the Garrison Command, which are enough to cause unrest in the concession. American Shipping Magnate</p>
<h3 id="e124">Da Lai Passed Away Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲ At the Age of 88　　▲ Shipping All Over the World</p>
<p>Robert Dollar, the American shipping magnate, had been engaged in shipping in the Far East for decades. He first opened the Sichuan River shipping line, then established Sino-American cargo ship lines, and also engaged in timber business. The amount of American timber shipped to China each year amounted to tens of millions of dollars. Later, he invested heavily to buy 17 President ships from the US Maritime Commission, operating three major shipping routes: Shanghai-San Francisco, Shanghai-Seattle, and around the world. The official postal ship routes from the United States to the Far East were completely in his hands. In recent years, due to the popularity of fast ships, he invested 32 million US dollars each to build two of the largest and fastest new postal ships in the Pacific, one named Hoover and the other named Coolidge, operating between China and the United States, breaking the new record in the Far East shipping industry. He devoted his life's work to the shipping industry. In any port in the world, he had his branch offices, docks, warehouses, and other industries. In China, he also established schools to benefit the Chinese people. He traveled around the world once a year. This year, he was 88 years old and in good spirits. He still went to the head office in San Francisco to work every day. Recently, he suddenly fell ill and passed away at 1:10 AM yesterday at his residence in San Raefel, California. When the news reached Shanghai, the American expatriates were shocked. The Shanghai head office has telegraphed all branches and ships to fly flags at half-mast in mourning.</p>

<p>When the Shanghai Incident occurred, the Ministry of Finance, under a secret order from the government, established an office in Shanghai. The vice ministers and important directors of the departments and bureaus were mostly stationed in Shanghai to maintain tax revenue, raise military funds, stabilize military morale, and maintain finance. Now that the Shanghai incident has come to an end, all the Shanghai-based personnel of the ministry, led by Vice Minister Li Tiao Sheng, relocated to Nanjing yesterday. Red Cross</p>

<p>Lu Chunhua, Chen Zude, and Pan Jiaji, three rescue workers of the 19th Detachment of the Chinese Red Cross Society (members of the Postal Workers' Union), set off on March 1st to rescue injured soldiers fighting against the Japanese in the Nanxiang area. Because our army was retreating at the time and the team members had not yet learned of it, they were captured by the Japanese army ambushed in the bamboo forest near Jiwang Temple. Their whereabouts were unknown. Recently, the corpses of Lu and others were discovered in a wasteland in Zhao Jia Nong. Their faces were rotten, and their bodies were covered with wounds. However, their clothes could still be identified. The muscles on Lu's arms were cut off with knives, and a hole was pierced through his thigh. There were also knife marks on his buttocks, which was extremely tragic and unbearable to witness. The families mourned the deaths greatly. After coffining and embalming, they were moved to the Xiao Wang Temple.</p>

City Chamber of Commerce Letter to Wine and Vegetable Restaurants and Tobacco Exchange Industries</p>
<h3 id="e129">Encouraging the Use of Domestic Beer and Cigarettes <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲ Purchasing Enemy Goods of a Drop of Wine and a Puff of Smoke　　▲ Is No Different Than Indirectly Drinking the Blood and Sucking the Marrow of Compatriots</p>
<p>Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the wine and vegetable restaurants and tobacco exchange industry associations to encourage the use of domestic beer and cigarettes, stating: We are writing to inform you that after reading the "Talks on Resisting Japanese Goods" published in the Morning Post on the 14th of this month, which lists the reduction of various Japanese imports in the three months from September to November of the 20th year of the Republic of China compared with the same period of the previous year, the smallest reduction was 20% for cement. The second was beer, wine, sulfuric acid, molasses, dyes, etc., which could be excused as industrial products, and other products could not be used to replace them at the time. As for beer and cigarettes, they are purely consumer goods, but even after a vigorous boycott, the reduction was only 20%, which is heartbreaking to say. In recent years, the quality of domestic Yantai beer has been pure and good, and domestic cigarettes have also made daily progress, both of which can meet the needs of society. If the wine and vegetable restaurant industry and the tobacco exchange industry can introduce them to customers when they purchase them, then at this time of common hatred for the enemy, there will be no one who must buy enemy goods. This is because if one drop of wine and one puff of smoke are enemy goods, it is no different than indirectly drinking the blood and sucking the marrow of our compatriots. After reading the report, this chamber of commerce cannot help but feel sentimental. Therefore, we specially send this letter to you, hoping that you will relay it to all members and earnestly pay attention to actively promoting it. We look forward to your attention.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Minutes of the Wing On Textile Company Shareholders' Meeting <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Wing On Textile Company held its 11th Shareholders' Meeting on the third floor of the Great Eastern Hotel on Nanjing Road.

<p>The British-owned National Marine Insurance Company at No. 17 Bund in this city, organized by prominent Chinese and foreign business leaders in Shanghai, is registered with the government with a registered capital of ten million taels of silver and a paid-up capital of three million taels. It specializes in various types of insurance such as life, fire, and automobile insurance. With its headquarters located in Shanghai, it provides prompt service and thorough handling, ushering in a new era in the history of insurance in Shanghai. It is reported that the company convened a shareholders' meeting at 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month. Shareholders representing 122,661 shares were present. Mr. Beale, the current Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was elected as chairman. He reported on the company's operating surplus for 1931 and the company's assets and investments, stating that the assets of the Four Seas Company currently exceed 4.18 million taels. One million taels have been allocated as capital for the life insurance department to directly protect policyholders' investments, and two million taels serve as collateral for the benefits of other types of insurance policies. The remaining one million and one hundred thousand taels are used for the most stable and reliable investments. Therefore, those who insure with the company have not only the guarantee of legal reserves but also the entire assets of the company as a second layer of security. Since the insured currency varies from place to place, the investment of reserves also varies accordingly. Thus, no matter what changes occur in the world economy, the Four Seas Company will not be affected, its foundation is solid, and it is as secure as a rock. All shareholders accepted this without objection. Subsequently, new directors were elected, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Wife Suffers from Mental Illness</p>
<p>▲ Friends Knocked on the Door for a Long Time But Received No Response</p>
<p>▲ Broken Bowls and Plates Found on the Floor</p>
<p>Zhang Fu, a local resident, and his wife, Zhang Wu, lived at No. 392 Chongqing Road, Xinzha. On the night of the 13th, Zhang was seen as usual. Unexpectedly, on the 14th, Zhang's friend Wang Genfu went to Zhang's house to invite Zhang to go shopping in the French Concession but found the door tightly closed. After knocking for a long time without any response, Wang initially thought that Mr. and Mrs. Zhang were still sound asleep, so he did not disturb their good dream and went alone. However, when Wang visited again at 4:30 PM on the same day, the door was still closed, and there was no response to his calls. Suspicions arose, and he rushed to report to the Chinese constable on duty at station No. 2592 nearby, who in turn reported to the Xinzha Police Station. The police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to Zhang's house, who managed to open the door and enter. They first saw Zhang Fu lying on the floor, with multiple injuries all over his body. He had already died. Zhang Wu was lying on the bed, also injured. In addition, broken bowls and plates were scattered all over the floor. The detectives immediately carried the deceased to the forensic station on Fielun Road for examination, while the woman was sent to the hospital. Doctors confirmed that she was suffering from mental illness. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the woman to the First Special District Local Court. According to the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, the deceased was beaten to death, and the defendant is suspected of murder. He requested that further investigation be conducted after the examination. Judge Feng briefly questioned her and ordered the defendant to be detained for further interrogation. After a while, the special court prosecutor went to the forensic station to examine the body and questioned the Chinese and foreign detectives about the circumstances of the incident. He then ordered the deceased's family to sign a guarantee, claim the body, and prepare it for burial.</p>

<p>Aunt Sacrifices Her Life</p>
<p>▲ Claims to Be Mentally Confused and Accidentally Injured Aunt</p>
<p>▲ Mother-in-Law Testifies in Court, Saying Son-in-Law's Conscience Is Very Vicious</p>
<p>Ding Xingzi from Yangzhou, angered by his wife, Mao Guiying from Hubei, having an affair with a certain adjutant, locked the door of the attic at No. 195 Dongyouheng Road at noon on the 3rd of this month while drunk and stabbed Mao Guiying in the forehead and other parts of her body. At the same time, Ding's aunt, Gao Xushi, also known as Xu Huiqing, and his mother-in-law, Mao Gao, tried to mediate and were stabbed. Xu Huiqing, who had been trying to reconcile the situation, suffered eight stab wounds to her abdomen and died despite being sent to the hospital for treatment. Ding Xingzi was detained by Liu Zhaonian, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, and was brought before the First Special District Court for a second interrogation. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over a further hearing in Court No. 1 of the High Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that relatives of Gao Xushi had arrived from Hankou and requested to be questioned. According to Mao Xushi, the deceased was her younger sister, whose husband had passed away. She had only one daughter named Jin Yu, who was also present in court. Jin Yu stated that she was twelve years old, had been living in Hankou, and that the deceased was her mother, who was killed by Ding Xingzi. She demanded justice. When questioned, Ding insisted that he stabbed Mao Guiying because she wanted to abandon him and follow someone else. He was so angry that he used a knife to stab her, but he only intended to scare her. He was mentally confused at the time and accidentally stabbed his aunt, Gao Xushi, to death. This was an impulsive act, not premeditated, and both knives were found in the attic, not brought from elsewhere. He spoke calmly, sometimes closing his eyes and lowering his head, and claimed that he usually did not like alcohol. According to his mother, Ding Wu, she had been living in Hankou for many years, relying on her eldest daughter to make a living. She did not run a brothel, but her daughter died last year. Ding Xingzi brought his nephew, a girl named E'zi, thirteen years old, his grandson, Xiao Mao, four years old, and a nineteen-year-old woman named Lao San, who is now on the run, to Shanghai. She now requests to take her niece and granddaughter back to Hankou. The court asked Ding if he agreed to his mother's request. He replied, "I agree." According to his mother-in-law, Mao Gao, she had spent a lot of money on the defendant, but he had a very vicious conscience and suddenly committed this act. Those who drank with him at the time were her fellow villagers with the surnames Leng and Hu, who had bought a catty of wine together. He only drank one cup and was not that drunk. One of the knives was not from the room, and he deliberately committed this malicious act. The court asked where the Leng and Hu were currently working. She replied that they were working in a fruit shop on Guangdong Street. Judge Shen ordered the case to be rescheduled for further testimony and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Employees of the Bank of China have always been enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods. Now that foreign troubles are urgent, it is especially necessary to have statistical surveys of domestic factories. The Asia-Pacific Electric Factory of China is the most historical and largest-scale domestic factory. Therefore, the general management office of the bank specially invited more than a hundred employees to visit the factory yesterday morning. Mr. Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of the factory, Mr. Feng Jiazheng, the chief engineer, Mr. Sun Xiangpu, the factory director, and other important staff members, received them separately. Starting from the glass department, they visited more than 40 departments, including the bulb department, the smelting room, the bulb-making room, the filament-making room, the vacuum room, and the light inspection room. The factory has more than 400 workers, all of whom have undergone long-term training. The work is very orderly and quiet. Therefore, the ability of Asia-Pacific brand bulbs and fans to become increasingly refined is not without reason. It took several hours to complete the visit. They enjoyed some refreshments and returned happily.</p>

<h3 id="e142">A Discussion of the Recent Situation in Geneva (Part 1) <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Kaisheng, the head of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations and the Minister to Switzerland, recently returned to China from Geneva. On the morning after his arrival in Shanghai, he met with a reporter. Despite having just finished a long journey, he spared ten minutes from his busy schedule to speak with me about fragmented information regarding the League of Nations. After reflecting on it, it seemed to have some value in recording. He said: "I have been stationed there for three years. If I were to rely on these three years of experience to report on the ins and outs of the League of Nations in their entirety, it would not be possible to exhaust the subject in a short time. I plan to write a special book after completing my official duties in Beijing, taking two or three months to allow my fellow countrymen to understand its inner workings. For now, I will first casually mention some trivial matters about Geneva, hoping to amuse the readers." The Sino-Japanese incident actually caused such a serious dispute. After the League of Nations accepted the case, it considered it the first major case of its kind that it had ever encountered. The League of Nations has already exhausted its wisdom and efforts and endured many hardships. But how effective can it be in reality? According to my observations, the League of Nations' handling of the Sino-Japanese incident can be roughly divided into three periods: (1) At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, the League of Nations did not receive detailed reports and did not fully understand the truth of the incident. Until the Paris Conference in mid-October, it was in a period of hesitation. (2) From the Paris Conference to the January 28th Shanghai War, the Japanese diplomatic representatives stationed in Europe gathered in Paris and concentrated their diplomatic power. On the one hand, they used various methods to contact the Paris press and used propaganda policies to change public opinion. The representatives of various countries were dazzled, as if they were in a fog. As a result, the Paris Conference was beneficial to Japan, and the League of Nations was in a period of being deceived. (3) With the outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai War, Japan launched a large-scale army, navy, and air force, implementing military coercion. Fortunately, my loyal 19th Route Army and 5th Army fought valiantly, holding out for more than a month. Although they unfortunately retreated to the second line of defense, the hostile actions of both sides still existed. As a result, all industries were suspended, and the interests of various countries in China were greatly damaged. World public opinion rose up against Japan, and the parliaments and powerful mass organizations of various countries criticized Japan, and the anti-Japanese atmosphere became increasingly intense. It was truly a matter of popular indignation, and Japan's ambition to destroy the covenant, invade territory was exposed to the world. The League of Nations changed its past attitude and turned to a period of condemnation. Since Mexico recently joined the League of Nations, there are a total of 55 member states. Based on factual observation, the attitude towards China can be roughly divided into three groups: (1) Those who express absolute sympathy account for eight-tenths; (2) Those who are ambivalent account for about one-tenth; (3) Those who do not express sympathy account for one-tenth. However, these eight-tenths of the countries are all weak nations. Generally, weak nations hate imperialism's violation of other people's sovereignty and territory, and they are rich in friendly sympathy towards us. The impassioned speeches of the representatives of various small countries in the previous meetings can prove this. The other two-tenths, however, are all powerful countries with very strong power. Although small countries are more numerous in number, they are actually at the mercy of others. Although they want to uphold justice, they cannot do anything about the obstruction of powerful countries! The reason why my country has never been protected by international conventions, despite Japan destroying the covenant, infringing upon our sovereignty, and seizing our territory, is because of these evil forces at work.</p>

<p>— Qu Chang</p>
<p>His given name was Rongxi, his courtesy name was someone. He was from Taishan, Guangdong. He was honest and had a sense of propriety, yet he was approachable. In his youth, he studied in the Eastern Neighbor (Japan) and had a high reputation. He graduated from what is called the Army Military Academy, surpassing his peers. The Japanese cheated us Chinese people and often kept their secrets, but he explored them by all means. The Japanese feared him. After returning to China, he thought about making contributions to the authorities, but they did not listen. Disappointed, he joined a certain unit and then rejected everything, focusing solely on managing the army with his savings. Later, he was transferred to the 78th Division of the 19th Army and promoted to battalion commander. In the autumn of 1931, he was ordered to go to Jiangxi to suppress the Red Bandits and achieved significant military success. In the winter, he came to Shanghai. Enemy ships were continuously coming and going at sea. Knowing that there was going to be a change, he warned his subordinates to prepare for war. In January 1932, the incident occurred. He inflicted heavy damage on the enemy several times. On February 13th, the enemy launched a large fog and secretly crossed the Wenzao浜 with several thousand troops, attacking our Caojiaqiao fortress. He was the first to detect it and ambushed their vanguard, crushing it. Afterwards, more and more enemies came. He fought to the death and shouted: "If we do not defend this, there will be no Wusong! I will not rest in peace and will not let an inch of land fall into the hands of the enemy!" He fought hand-to-hand combat four times before our reinforcements were able to arrive and win a complete victory. However, he died from his severe injuries. More than three hundred people died with him.</p>
<p>Wang Quchang said: "Our country started sending young people to study military affairs in the East and West overseas during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty. For the past sixty years, millions have been spent annually, amounting to thousands of people before and after. But seeking those who can live up to the country, I have found two people. One is Brigade Commander Han Guangdi, and the other is this one. Guangdi died in defeat, while this one died in victory. This one seems to have surpassed Guangdi. He managed the army strictly and shared food, drink, life, and death with the soldiers, having the demeanor of an ancient famous general, but his merits ended here. Alas."</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A Young Strongman</p>
<p>In Birmingham, England, there is a twenty-year-old young man named John Sharpe who can be considered one of the strongest men in the world and deserves the title of (Modern Samson). He is a carpenter's assistant. Whenever he has free time, he practices boxing and kicking for his own amusement, without any intention of pursuing hygiene or physical exercise. He is six feet three inches tall and as strong as an ox. He can lift a horse and a cart. He can carry six grown men on his back. His teeth can lift a very heavy wrought silver box. He can also lift from the ground an iron beam that requires two horses and a large cart to carry. Such divine power is truly amazing. According to him, (I usually like to carry things. I started playing with them at the age of six, learning to be a strong man. At the age of fifteen, I could lift a cloth-rolling machine with one hand. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, I could hold a large fruit bowl from the kitchen high, with my whole family sitting on it.)</p>
<h3 id="e145">Shad from Fuyang <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Cooking fresh delicacies in early summer, shad is an exquisite dish. Shad is flat and long in shape and silvery white in color. However, the meat contains many fine bones. This is why the ancients said that shad has many bones and crabapple has no fragrance, which is considered a regrettable thing. The scales contain a lot of fat, so chefs usually do not remove the scales when preparing shad. They cut pork lard and ham into small pieces, place them on top, and then cover them with net oil. Steamed to perfection, the taste is absolutely delicious. This year, the price of shad is quite expensive, about 2,000 cash per catty. Poor scholars dare not taste the new delicacy. Shad from Fuyang is considered the best, along with bream from the Yi River, carp from Luoyang, and shad from Songjiang, all of which are famous products. It is said that the people of Fuyang say that every year during the season, fishermen catch it with nets. They must first offer it to the local magistrate. This custom has continued to the present day. Becoming an official allows one to enjoy a special culinary privilege, which is truly enviable. Moreover, it is said that shad that pass under the fishing platform of the hermit Yan Gao have a slightly red spot on their lips, resembling a light blush of rouge, which is considered a special sign. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and his wife once boated on the Fuyang River one year and enjoyed drinking wine under the moonlight. The boatman, being perceptive, presented a shad with a red spot to replace the Han Shu to accompany the wine. Mr. Chiang did not dare to eat it immediately. Madam Soong Mei-ling tasted it first and encouraged Mr. Chiang to eat it. They both praised it endlessly. This year, the National Government has moved to Luoyang. I wonder if Mr. Chiang, after cooking carp, will also remember the shad of Fuyang. I admire his leisure and elegance.</p>
<h3 id="e146">A Record of a Returned Jade <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>Someone in Berlin received a package at their home one day. In an instant, the person who delivered it was gone. Upon opening it, it turned out to be a money pouch with the name and address of the recipient on it. It was an item lost eight years ago. At the time of the loss, it contained fifty-five marks (approximately two pounds and fifteen shillings in English currency). Now, it had increased to seventy-five marks (approximately three pounds and fifteen shillings in English currency). A note of thanks was attached, which roughly stated that the person who had picked up the lost pouch had obtained fifty-five marks and had used them to make a profit, receiving many benefits. They were now specially returning an extra pound to fulfill their wish and express their gratitude. In October 1918, a German soldier named Lutz died in battle in France. Later, a British soldier found a diary in his pocket, along with an Iron Cross medal. He carefully preserved them, intending to return them to Lutz's family. However, the diary only contained the name and no address, making it impossible to trace them. One day, while reading a newspaper, he saw that a famous German actress named Lutz Anni was performing in England. This stirred up old memories, so he wrote to her to inquire, attaching a portrait of Lutz from the diary. Although Anni was not a relative of Lutz, she recognized him at first sight and provided the address of Lutz's family. Thus, the diary and the Iron Cross medal were returned to Lutz's family after fourteen years from the date they were found.</p>
<p>Note: Both of these are recent events. Both involve people of good faith and can serve as an example to the world. The latter is especially commendable, as the British soldier had no obligation to return the items but ultimately did so. As for picking up money and returning it with interest, the act is certainly good, but there is still a hint of luck involved. However, the fact that the lost pouch was carefully stored for eight years suggests that the intention to return the money was not a temporary impulse. Being overly critical would be detrimental to the principle of fairness and forgiveness.</p>

<p>— Gan</p>
<p>Yang Yunshi is known in the world as a poet. It seems so, but not entirely. Yunshi's original name was Zhaoqing, later changed to Jianying. After the age of forty, he changed his name to Qi. He was from Changshu, Jiangsu. He was the son of Xinbo, a Censor of the Qing Dynasty (Chongyi). He passed the combined Gengxin examination and served as a Section Chief in the Postal and Telegraph Department. He was appointed Consul-General to Singapore. He loved the beauty of the South Seas and considered establishing a business there for long-term residence. At that time, the islands of Southeast Asia were competing to plant rubber trees. Qi was interested and returned to China, selling property to obtain some capital, but it was not enough. He raised funds and leased 12,000 acres of land to establish a rubber planting company. The mountains and forests were vast, rarely traversed by people since ancient times. Dense trees blocked the sky, and brambles covered the ground. Qi would personally enter the mountains to supervise the work, unafraid of tigers, wolves, snakes, and vipers. Over a year, he planted approximately 3,000 acres of rubber trees, totaling 190,000 saplings, achieved through numerous hardships and dangers. He intended to abandon officialdom for business, hoping to live out his days in prosperity. However, with the outbreak of the European War, rubber prices plummeted. Qi's business remained stagnant for three years, overgrown with weeds, and he lacked the funds to pay the land taxes. The government confiscated the land as per regulations. Qi returned dejectedly and lived in seclusion in his hometown. Chen Xiufeng (Guangyuan), the Military Governor of Jiangxi, heard of his talent and invited him to Nanchang. Upon arriving, Qi did not wish to stay long. Coincidentally, Guangyuan sent troops to attack Zhang Zongchang, fighting in Yuanzhou. Someone cited Qi's poem "Feeling Autumn," with lines such as "White bones like mountains, generals esteemed; gold fills the land, the boatmen worry," suggesting it criticized Guangyuan's warmongering and greed. Guangyuan did not understand, seemingly believing it, seemingly not. Qi left in anger. That year, Wu Ziyu (Peifu) respectfully invited him to join his staff, treating him with great hospitality. Qi once wrote in a reply to Wu's wife, "In three years, I chose a wife and found you; in ten years, I chose a master and found Wu." He successively served as the chief of the confidential department and secretary-general, strategizing behind the scenes, knowing everything and saying everything. During Peifu's resurgence, when the army was stationed in Wuhan, a staff member, Zhang Ziwu (Qihuang), proposed diverting the Yangtze River. Qi strongly opposed it, and the plan was abandoned. The path to Pingdeng and Dengwei almost became deserted. The Seven-Li Shantang was desolate. No one paid respects at the tomb of Zhenniang. Even the Lingering Garden, the West Garden, and the Lion Grove were not as lively as in the past.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Incident had just begun. Shanghai residents flocked to Suzhou and Hangzhou to seek refuge. By March 2nd, after our army changed its strategy, Suzhou became an important rear base and a focal point for the Japanese army. Rumors spread rapidly, and people were in a state of anxiety. Wealthy families relocated one after another. Consequently, those who had fled from Shanghai fled again. Recently, as the situation gradually stabilized, those who had fled from the county returned one after another. The chaotic exodus came to an end.</p>
<p>Due to the large number of refugees, train services were disrupted. The businesses of various shifts in Suzhou were three times more profitable than usual. In this time of national crisis, all industries were in decline except for transportation, which thrived more than ever. One could say it was a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>There are seven theaters in Suzhou. They had temporarily suspended performances due to the tense situation. The Eastern, Great Brightness, Lequn, Park, YMCA, and Nanjing theaters have now resumed operations. However, the Peking opera at the New Stage is still suspended due to the impact of the situation. Even the six theaters that have resumed operations have seen a significant decrease in business compared to the past. All the managers are lamenting endlessly. This is also a gift from the Japanese army.</p>

<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Jinrong and Mr. Cao Youshan, last autumn, sent over nine hundred people to Dr. Fang Shenyu, a gold needle specialist, for diagnosis. All were told they needed no medicine. What day is this? There must be an alarming increase in epidemic diseases. Dr. Fang was deeply worried, and Mr. Huang and Mr. Cao also urged him not to stop helping people and saving lives. Therefore, they joined forces with the renowned doctor, Mr. Wang Shaoda, to establish the Quansheng Medical Society at No. 27 Hele Lane, Xinzha Road. They began providing medical services on May 9th. This is in response to the current needs, so we are happy to report it.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>A certain Minister had a daughter and was very picky about choosing a son-in-law. The son of one of his friends returned from overseas, a handsome young man. The Minister liked him and said, "He could be my worthy son-in-law." A colleague heard this and passed the message to the young man, who wished to meet the daughter. They arranged to meet in a park. On the appointed day, the Minister's second wife, accompanied by his daughter, went richly adorned. The young man saw them and was smitten. He told his friend, "The tall and graceful one is truly my wife." The friend exclaimed, "That is the Minister's wife! The stout one standing beside her is his daughter." The people of the capital heard of this and found it strange, saying, "The son-in-law has fallen for his mother-in-law!" Alas!</p>

<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Seeking audience at the powerful gates often makes generals falter; imprisoned in the prison of love, the jailer can be a husband.</p>
<p>However, Liang Xiaoyun was also very clever. Like a startled swan, she busily ran to the side of the Fifth Madam, sitting down close to her heels. She cleared the left side of the lamp stand. Ye Zuozhang had already walked to the front of the bed, blocked by the Fifth Madam, and was too embarrassed to continue chasing Liang Xiaoyun. He had no choice but to lie down on the bed as well. That day, Ye Zuozhang was wearing a long robe and mandarin jacket. He then shook off his shoes and threw them far away, raising his feet high and resting them on the bed rail, squinting at Liang Xiaoyun and laughing incessantly. Liang Xiaoyun remained calm and tried her best to appear generous and composed. The Fifth Madam spoke for her again, saying, "My eighth sister and I have been talking for a while. The person she married is from the same province where you are the Military Governor. He is a very good young student, but he also trained in the militia back home and is good at military affairs. I think, aren't you in need of people right now? Since I have such a good brother-in-law, why should I let him seek a job elsewhere? One day, please have my eighth sister bring him to meet you, and you can assign him a good position." Ye Zuozhang suddenly kicked his leg and sat up, laughing loudly, "Very good! He is my citizen, willing to come to me for a job. Of course, he doesn't oppose me or curse me. Why wouldn't I welcome him? Besides, considering Old Eighth's face, we're practically relatives. Easy to handle. Tell him to come! There are plenty of titles like Councilor and Advisor. Let him choose whatever he wants. I can even issue an official order today. That's how straightforward I am." Liang Xiaoyun had just stood up and said softly, "Thank you for the Military Governor's cultivation," but unexpectedly, the Fifth Madam reached out and pressed Liang Xiaoyun back down, her cherry lips about to utter words of disdain, "What did you say? Councilor and Advisor? Those are all worthless nominal positions. You can use them to placate irrelevant people, but for me and Eighth Sister? How can you be so dismissive? That won't do. You can't make us lose face like that. It has to be a real position! I heard that my brother-in-law has many militiamen under his command who can fight well. You can reorganize them into a regular army, which will be better than those useless officers of yours when they go to the front lines. You should appoint him as a commander and let him help you properly. You don't have to worry about not winning battles in the future. You have to be clear that most of this is for your own benefit!"</p>

<p>▲ American East Bank Company Fortunately Reports</p>
<p>Last Saturday, although there was no special news in the economic sector, the securities market continued its downward trend. Railway stocks were particularly weak due to news of leading companies in the industry suspending or reducing interest rates, as well as poor railway operations in the first three months of this year. Therefore, their prices fell even more. People must be extremely weak, but although the securities market on Saturday was affected by railway stocks, it was quite sufficient to show that the recent downward trend of the securities market seemed to have stopped. Although industries related to railways were all affected, on average, the decline was still small. Several stocks were still able to rise somewhat at the close. Utility stock prices were very weak, with (American Telegraph and Telephone) falling to $95.25, a record low since 1921. However, the public bond market rose by 1.31 pounds, which cannot be said to be an unsatisfactory matter.</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending soft, with the situation turning downward, presumably because of reports of riots in Japan, with the Prime Minister being attacked. There are deep fears that gold prices may undergo extreme changes tomorrow, leading to further demoralization. At the same time, actual demand is decreasing further. It is found that various firms have already bought a great deal in the past week, so there is naturally a period of quiet. However, the general mentality is that once business stops, the desire to short becomes stronger, and the market is forced to trend downward again, with signs of weakness reappearing. But the inventory of various factories is thinner than before, and the ability to withstand is not as weak as it was the other day. In short, the surrounding environment is not good, and changes can easily occur. And most non-industry players are inclined to short, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ New Short Sellers Discovered in the Auction</p>
<p>The morning market opened softly, due to unfavorable news and flat foreign cotton prices. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and prices for each month fell by five or six cents. In the second and third sessions, prices fell again. As a result, prices for each month fell by six, eight, and nine cents to one or two taels. The afternoon situation was even weaker. It was heard that actual demand was sluggish and there were new short sellers, and prices for each month fell again by one, two, four, and five cents. The total volume of transactions for the day was 6,000 bales. It was found that Gengfeng sold 650 bales, Changfeng 750 bales, Dachangcheng 200 bales, Shenji 700 bales, Tianlong 150 bales, and Yukang 300 bales. Hengyi 150 bales. Buyers: Jifeng 350 bales, Dafeng 250 bales, Yuantai 5 bales, Yichang 500 bales, Xiesheng 250 bales, Mingde 200 bales, Rongxing 150 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>▲ Spot Sales Do Less Business with Fewer Openings</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are less. It was found that various firms bought a total of 520 bales for the day, with prices falling by five to seven and a half cents. Customer firms: Tianjin entered 50 bales, Ningbo 70 bales, Guangdong 100 bales, Jiangxi 15 bales, Fujian 30 bales, inland 130 bales, Wenzhou 50 bales, Wuhu 10 bales, Shantou 20 bales, fellow traders 50 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Cotton Market Still in Slump <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is still sluggish, and the market is softening, because foreign cotton is dull and lifeless, and most people expect drastic changes in the gold market tomorrow, making people more fearful. In addition, the yarn market is showing weakness again. Foreign cotton firms are making great efforts to solicit business in the market, with lower prices. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Shenxin Factory's telegram for buying foreign American cotton has already been transferred today, the price is 28 taels and 5 qian, totaling 5,700 pieces, sold by Fojia Foreign Company, to be delivered in July and August, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Standard Down</p>
<p>The morning market opened with flat foreign cotton, but with bad news, selling sentiment in the market was stronger, and prices for each month fell by one or two cents and a half. In the afternoon, it was heard that although Shenxin had made a large purchase, most people in the market thought that it was not easy to advance to two taels, and some limited purchases to two taels, so the market atmosphere did not move. Recently, the near months fell by 1.5 cents, and the distant months were flat. The total volume of transactions for the day was 11,600 dan. It was found that Gengfeng sold 800 dan, Hengyi 600 dan, Tongfu 200 dan, Mingde 300 dan, Changfeng 1,000 dan, Yicheng 1,000 dan, Yuchang 400 dan, Dachangcheng 300 dan, Yiyu 200 dan, Changhe 300 dan, and buyers Rongxing 600 dan, Mingde 700 dan, Tianlong 300 dan, Ruidi 500 dan, Xiesheng 400 dan, Yuanda 400 dan, Yifeng 300 dan, and Tongxing 200 dan.

<p>The local American An Cotton Company received a telegram from New York on May 12, saying that the cotton market was sluggish, with very few transactions. The number of liquidations was not small, mostly absorbed by fellow traders, and there were not many new speculative transactions.

<p>▲ Bombay: Market conditions remained soft last week due to continued increases in inventory. However, holders were unwilling to sell at this time due to export transactions in the Far East. Japan had some inquiries for Yemula and Gandhi artificial flowers, but the asking prices were very low. In terms of spot goods, demand for yarn and cloth decreased, and yarn factories in Bombay and Ahmedabad reduced working hours. In addition, Bombay yarn factories had already imported a lot of American cotton, so there was no need for Indian cotton for the time being. Therefore, the situation was very soft. The collection of white Luo Creek was flat, and other flowers arrived in abundance.</p>

<p>▲ Liverpool: Spot demand was quiet last week, and futures trading was peaceful. At the beginning of the week, the trend was quite optimistic due to Japanese merchants purchasing Egyptian cotton and lower bank interest rates. Later, due to the slump in American cotton prices, it returned to dim. Egyptian cotton was still stable due to good news from Alexandria</p>

<p>▲ Cocoon prices up to 35 yuan... Farmers dry and reel silk themselves.</p>
<p>In the market towns near Chang'an, only 30-40% of farmers raised silkworms this year compared to previous years. The silkworm ants also suffered damage due to the weather. The new cocoon harvest is only about one-third of a normal year. Only two or three cocoon shops opened for weighing. Purchasing goods is unusually rigorous. The highest price for improved seed cocoons is only 35 yuan, and the ordinary price is 27-28 yuan. Farmers who suffered excessive losses on silkworm costs mostly carry back to dry the cocoons themselves and reel local silk, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market of this port, the new Qimen black tea had a huge amount of over 8,000 boxes of new samples laid out throughout the city. The British firms Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, Xiehe, and Tianxiang, and other large trading houses, were all extremely busy with taste tests. However, because most of the Qimen tea purchased last year did not yield a profit, they mostly held a tight attitude toward pricing. Chinese tea merchants, on the other hand, were unwilling to lower prices to seek sales because the inland production amount was reduced this year and the cost was high. Therefore, the negotiations between the two sides continued all day and were difficult to approach. The new market has not yet opened. For the Zhenmei green tea on both the Luzhuang and Tuzhuang roads, a total of more than 600 boxes were purchased by companies such as Xiehe and Jardine Matheson throughout the city. The sales price for Luzhuang goods was 135 taels, and the sales price for Tuzhuang goods ranged from 82 taels to 115 taels, a further decrease of four or five taels compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Recent Qiwu Tea News <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>▲ Qicha affected by excessive rain and lack of foreign demand</p>
<p>The new teas with the first name from all tea firms in Qimen have already arrived in Qi, and the second and third gangs are in the process of searching for them. Each firm is rushing to produce and transport them to Shanghai to grab market share, and they have all begun to pick and bake them this week. The first name tribute tea can be formed into piles within days, and the first name box tea can also be shipped within ten days. Because Qiupu has convenient transportation, the new tea can arrive in Shanghai earlier. According to Qicha merchants, the second and third name teas in Qifuqiu are not produced well due to the cold and rainy weather, and the quality and taste are lower than the first tea. For the sake of protecting costs, Hao Fang is not very enthusiastic about importing them, and the market is also declining to 30 to 40 yuan per dan compared to the first tea. In addition, the tea warehouses stationed in Qi have tightened their remittances, and the amount of loan funds issued has decreased by more than one million yuan compared with last year. In addition, the current silver in Jingtun is not accessible due to the bandits, and the Hao Fang is hindered by economic difficulties, resulting in its inability to increase the amount as much as possible. Fortunately, the number of tea firms has not decreased this year, and the mountain households have not yet been affected.</p>
<p>▲ Wuyuan tea firms are preparing to leave Zhuang</p>
<p>The new tea in Wuyi has been opened by mountain households for several days. However, due to continuous rain and cold weather, the development of mountain and island tea is uneven, and the harvesting and baking are extremely laborious, resulting in reduced shipments. Each firm is deeply afraid that the Tunxi numbers will rush to order first when the new tea is about to enter the market, and they have been preparing to leave Zhuang. The difficulty they feel is that the finance is unusually tight. As of now, none of the tea warehouses stationed in Wu have released a single ticket. All the numbers currently preparing hold self-funded activities, and Tun and Jing rely solely on a small amount of supply from local shops in this county, which is of no help. It is expected that the pain of the current silver being insufficient will be felt when the new tea opens.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Rice Market Affected by Rain <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ HunSouth Yesterday, the source of the West Road was more than ten shops. Due to the continuous rain, the shops in this street opened early and raised the price by one or two cents each. Changxi Beigeng and early and late rice were opened with 500 stones. If the weather is clear tomorrow, the rice can also be opened.</p>
<p>▲ HunNorth Yesterday, the source of Xiang Road was 13-14 ships from Wuxi, Liyang, Kunshan, Xuanxing, Danyang, Songjiang, Qingpu, etc. The large rain stopped the shipment in the morning. When the weather cleared in the afternoon, several companies such as Tongxing, Xichang, Ruichang, Dachang, and Wansheng opened thin rice, early rice, and Beigeng for about 2,000 dan. The situation was two cents higher than the previous market. The inland letter said that the rough rice market was upward, so it is difficult for the market in this port to fall back low.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Foreign Rice Jumps One Dime <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲ Inland Jiangbei This Street's Various Roads Are Selling Smoothly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market showed a significant improvement. The total market opened with more than 25,000 bags. People's hearts were upward, and prices also jumped more than one dime. As CanRi Du rice is rising, and rose another two dimes yesterday, this street therefore paid attention to foreign rice. The Changxi gang in the interior and Jiangbei in this street were also competing to purchase in the market. The market price and people's hearts were rising. If the road to the present and tomorrow is still prosperous, there is still a possibility for the market to rise higher. The total market opened with 22,000 bags of small twisted rice, priced at 10 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2 fen to 10 yuan and 3 jiao. Old small twisted rice was 10 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 fen to 10 yuan, 1 jiao, and a half. Rough small twisted rice was 1,000 bags, priced at 9 yuan and 6 jiao to 9 yuan and 3 jiao. Saigon No. 1 was 1,000 bags, priced at 11 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen. Mindang rice was 1,000 bags, priced at 11 yuan to 10 yuan, 9 jiao, and 3 fen. Another 2 weeks of delivery was 1,000 bags, priced at 11 yuan. Kaladi rough road goods were 1,000 bags, priced at 9 yuan and 8 jiao, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Flour Market Transactions Very Active in This Street <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed improvement again. Old brands were highly sought after by domestic buyers on this street, and the market immediately tightened. The month opened at 2.04 taels, quickly rising to 2.05 taels. There were orders for 1 million bags of "Warship" brand flour for this month, and the warehouse receipts needed to be collected by the 20th, causing buyers to hesitate. The opening price was 2.035 taels, and the closing price slightly decreased to 2.03 taels. "Fortress" brand was only 2.15 taels. Other brands were rarely available on the market. Returned warehouse receipts were mostly around 2.05 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Raw Granulated White Sugar Tends to Decline Again <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market at the guild was weak, resulting in scattered transactions. Initially, the seller's asking price for No. 24 Dutch sugar (raw granulated white) was 13.35 taels, but there was little interest. Later, the transaction price fell to 13.275 taels, and buying interest remained low. Sellers were still active, and the market was generally quiet, with a downward trend. Medium granulated white sugar was even less in demand. Transactions of Taikoo sugar were also sluggish. Tianjin B-grade goods were still arriving, with an asking price of 16.3 taels, but many were waiting and watching. Spot CW mark was 16 taels, and HM mark was 14 taels. The market was only flat, without surprises, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Black Pepper and Fragrant Mushroom Markets Both Depressed <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>▲ The removal of black pepper by merchants has been exceptionally sluggish recently. According to overseas telegrams, the Dutch market has fallen by 2.25 guilders. Local firms are eager to sell their stock, but merchant sales are not moving and few traders are interested in buying. Therefore, the market is declining. Yesterday's asking prices were lowered, with "Black Large" at 44 taels and "No. 1" at 45 taels, a decrease of more than one tael compared to the previous session, and few buyers were interested.</p>
<p>▲ The output of new fragrant mushrooms has greatly increased this year. According to reports from Jiangxi, Ningguo, Lanxi, Tunxi, Fujian and other places, the harvest is abundant. Recent arrivals have been very abundant. It is currently estimated that there are more than 500 dan (traditional Chinese unit of dry measure) in stock. However, merchant business is sparse, resulting in an oversupply and falling prices. Currently, good quality large pieces are at 180 taels, high-grade mushrooms are at 168 taels, and ordinary mushrooms are at 160 to 155 taels. There is currently little hope of price increases, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Shanghai Price Index for April Investigation <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The National Tariff Commission recently announced the Shanghai price index, saying that since the January 28th Incident, various industries in the city have generally gone on strike, and the wholesale market has almost completely shut down for two months. The Shanghai wholesale, export, and import price indexes compiled by the commission for February and March were both missing. Although the Chamber of Commerce notified on April 1 that it would reluctantly resume business from that day, the Japanese army had not withdrawn, and the Shanghai area was still under military control. Commerce had not yet recovered, and most general prices fell. Comparing the three indexes for April with those for January, exports fell, wholesale prices fell slightly, but imports rose slightly. The following table compares the various indexes for this month with those for January and the same month last year. (1926 = 100)</p>

<h3 id="e169">Official Platitudes, Part 3 <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Ministry of Interior intends to suggest to the Executive Yuan that future candidates for provincial governors and department heads should be nominated by the central leadership. Those already appointed should also submit detailed resumes for review by the responsible ministry to prevent mediocrity. Is this suggestion a policy to clean up officialdom? Or is it a form of control?</p>
<p>What constitutes mediocrity? What constitutes competence? Since the Xinhai Revolution, the concept of qualifications has long been abandoned. The golden rule of the past, "Don't be an official unless you have someone in court," no longer applies. As long as you have a powerful backer, even mediocrity is not mediocrity. Those who participated in the revolution at some point, even mediocrity is not mediocrity. Or those with a few guns behind them, even mediocrity is not mediocrity. Or those who share the same ideology on a certain condition, even mediocrity is not mediocrity.</p>
<p>Now that the candidates for provincial governors and department heads must be nominated by the central leadership and those already appointed must be reviewed by the responsible ministry, the selection of department heads in the future will be entirely in the hands of the central leadership. What the central leadership considers mediocre is mediocre, and what it considers competent is not mediocre. This is essentially a new system of centralization, not a way to clean up officialdom. Cleaning up officialdom is not done this way.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Reviving Dry Cell Batteries <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Gong</p>
<p>The use of electricity and the progress of the world are always directly proportional. The more the world progresses, the more electricity is used. Therefore, in recent decades, the use of electricity has increased day by day. Dry cell batteries are one example. Flashlights, small radios, and other machines that require little electricity all use them. But one thing is a pity: if a dry cell battery is used up in a day, it's useless and you have to buy a new one, which is very uneconomical. Now there is a way to make used dry cell batteries work again. I'll write this method below:</p>
<p>Dissolve ammonium chloride in a bowl of warm water to make a saturated solution (that is, pour ammonium chloride into the water and stir with a stick until it is completely dissolved in the water or completely disappears, then add more ammonium chloride and stir until it can no longer dissolve in the water). Then, take the used dry cell battery with the case intact. Make several holes in its case, then put it in this solution for several hours. Take it out, and it will have electricity again. I have tried this method several times. Although the revived dry cell battery doesn't last as long as a new one, it is much cheaper than buying a new one. Finally, I must state that when putting it in the solution, do not let the carbon rod in the middle touch the solution. If it does, it will be useless.</p>

<p>In classroom two of S University, it was nine o'clock, ten minutes before class. Several college students were talking.</p>
<p>"Old Li, you didn't go to class yesterday afternoon? Did you go to the movies with Miss Chen? That little bird's hips are very developed, she looks too fat," said Ah Huang, the optimist.</p>
<p>Then, Xiao Hei, the radical with the nickname "Little Black," said angrily, "In this time of national crisis, you are still indulging in love? We should rise up and do our best to fight the enemy, sacrificing ourselves for the country!"</p>
<p>Before Xiao Hei finished speaking, Wen Bin, a bookworm of the scholar class, said with a sneer, "You people only shout slogans and don't do anything practical. Have you ever done anything for the benefit of the country or society? Our only responsibility now is to study. We can ignore all national affairs."</p>
<p>"That's a joke! You don't care if the country is destroyed? Where will you go to study? The country is an organization that protects the people, and the people should uphold the dignity of the country," said Zhou, a petty bureaucrat.</p>
<p>"You always talk about the country, what has the country given us? What benefits have we gained?" Xiao Yichen, the pessimist, said indifferently.</p>
<p>Before anyone could say anything else, the bell for class rang, and everyone stopped talking.</p>

<p>"Mom! I want four dimes worth of foreign stamps." Qin Fang had just returned from school and was already finding her mother to act coy.</p>
<p>"Oh? How many letters do you have to send?"</p>
<p>"It's not that. There's a really good lipstick advertised in the newspaper. If you send four dimes, they'll send you a sample box. Lingying, from the Li family, has already written and sent a letter. I want to too."</p>
<p>"Go ask your father for it. It's okay for a young lady to put on a little lipstick."</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>The third day, she was holding the telephone receiver at school.</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. Wang? ... I'm Qin! ... See a movie? See a movie? ... I'm not going this afternoon. ... Why? ... Sorry! ... So, will you go tomorrow? ... Hehehe ... Thank you! ... Goodbye! ... Goodbye!"</p>
<p>She hung up the phone. She was really angry. She thought, "Why hasn't the lipstick been sent yet? Not putting on any lipstick and going to see a movie with a man; what is that? Maybe it will be sent tomorrow. ... I really let him down today!"</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and it was the second third day again.</p>
<p>In the classroom, the teacher was lecturing on the platform, but she was whispering with Lingying.</p>
<p>"Has your lipstick been sent?"</p>
<p>"Not yet. What about yours?"</p>
<p>"It hasn't been sent either."</p>
<p>"So, why?"</p>
<p>"I think it's probably a scam to get stamps. Do you think so?"</p>
<p>"That's right! I think so too. I'm so angry!"</p>
<p>So that's how it was. She really felt sorry for her Mr. Wang a few days ago. As for the forty cents worth of stamps? What a waste!</p>

<p>— Yuxian</p>
<p>What is Shanghai? There is no need to use a lot of words and language to explain it. As long as you study everything you see on the street, you will get a correct answer.</p>
<p>I have seen a loafer carrying a beggar with broken feet on his back in the morning, placing him at a busy street corner, and then carrying him back in the evening. If you want to study their relationship, it must be nothing more than father and son, or brothers.</p>
<p>I have seen a mother and son pretending to be a ship's steward and a passenger, arguing over a piece of luggage behind the Great World entertainment complex. The son said she didn't pay for the boat, and the mother said she couldn't find her relatives, and he was stealing her luggage.</p>
<p>Of course, writing complaints on the ground is also a common occurrence. I saw a five- or six-year-old child writing on the sidewalk with chalk, "Orphaned child XXX, lost parents early..." and other clichéd complaints. Many people were gathered around. Although everyone knew that the child was a cunning character, some people still threw him a few coppers. Because the child's writing was very beautiful, I also threw him a silver dime. The Shanghainese people around me looked at me with strange eyes, as if saying, "What a waste! Is it worth throwing away a silver dime for this!"</p>
<p>Shanghainese people have no sympathy or pity, only black eyeballs and white silver dollars. Is Shanghai really like this? Please go to the streets and search for the answer.</p>

<p>A certain wealthy merchant was hosting a dinner, and the guest of honor was a certain division commander. The wealthy merchant was flattering the commander, praising him effusively.</p>
<p>The commander said with a sigh, "The ways of the world are so fickle these days..."</p>
<p>"Yes," the wealthy merchant interrupted before the commander could finish, "Who these days isn't just a fair-weather friend? Are there any truly loyal people left? Only..."</p>
<p>He paused for a moment and continued, "To be honest, only our XXX flatterer can be considered a loyal person. As long as there's a connection, not to mention anything else, just talking about you, commander..."</p>
<p>"Not to curse the commander, but even if the commander became a beggar and came to my place, I would still treat him the same way I do today," he said.</p>
<p>"Hey! Why are you cursing the commander? Forgive me! Forgive me! I deserve to be slapped!" He said, slapping himself twice. The commander nodded, seemingly paying attention but not really caring.</p>
<p>"XXX is here again. Does the master want to see him?" The doorman came in and said this.</p>
<p>"Hmph! That pauper is here again? You wait, I'll chase him away!" The wealthy merchant replied sternly.</p>
<p>"XXX? Isn't that the former Commander X of the X Division of the X Army? What happened to him after he fell from grace?" The commander asked, reminiscing.</p>
<p>"Him? He's not good himself. How can he have the commander's good fortune? And he often comes here to borrow money. Who has money to lend him? Now he's practically a beg...gar..." He said, his face turning red without realizing it.</p>
<p>"Oh..." The commander smiled silently.</p>

<h3 id="e177">A Maid's Autobiography (Part 1) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Leshan</p>
<p>Last Sunday, at the residence of my old friend Mr. C, I heard the newly hired maid recount the hellish life she lived as a servant in the S residence three years ago. I thought that cases of maid abuse are still heard from time to time these days, so I specifically wrote it out to tell the general advocates of humanitarianism and the emancipation of slaves and servants:</p>
<p>I (the maid's self-description, and so on below) and XX were both unfortunately sold by our parents, who were forced by hunger and cold, to the S residence to work as maids. After being fed by them, although my (body and hair) were (received from my parents), at that time they were (received from the master). They could beat or scold me, making me their slave.</p>
<p>My former employer had a master, mistress, young master, young lady, young master's wife, and the young lady's daughter, a little girl. Although there were only six people, cooking and serving tea was very difficult. It was truly a case of "the master wants wontons, the mistress wants noodles." What suited the master's taste did not suit the mistress's preferences. Therefore, we were often scolded and annoyed, and even beaten.</p>
<p>The master and the young master's wife were both addicted to opium. Lying on the couch, they often wanted us to massage their legs until the middle of the night. We had to keep our sleepy eyes open and massage their legs. I remember once when XX fell asleep while massaging because she was tired, the young mistress stabbed her with the burning opium pipe support, causing her to scream like a slaughtered pig. To this day, the image of her bleeding remains deeply in my mind.</p>
<p>Especially on those cold winter nights when the north wind was blowing fiercely, when the masters gave the order to eat a midnight snack, we had to get up from our warm blankets. Although we trembled with cold, we finally braced ourselves and braved the cold to do it.</p>
<p>The seventeen- or eighteen-year-old young master was the most mischievous and violent. He often condescended to fight us, and when he was happy, he would put his arms around us and kiss us, insulting us at will. When he was unhappy, he would punch and kick us. The most unjust thing was when the masters saw it, they would always whip us without asking why, accusing us of seducing the young master. We really had no way to explain ourselves!</p>
<p>Later, we naturally avoided this harmful young master like snakes and scorpions. However, he became angry out of shame and picked on us. He would either say that the tea was cold or that the water was too hot. I remember one summer morning, XX invited him to wash his face. She invited him three times before he graced us with his presence, but he scolded her for the water being cold. XX added some hot water, but unexpectedly it scalded his precious hand. He suddenly splashed the basin of water on XX, drenching her completely. The thin summer clothes clung tightly to her body. This cruel young master clapped his hands and laughed, shouting, "Look at the model..." She was so ashamed that she wanted to find a hole to hide in.</p>

<h3 id="e178">The Dominance of (Old Sayings) <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Yunzong</p>
<p>Speaking of the situation in our country, everyone knows that it is terribly bad. Although there have been several reforms recently, it's just changing the soup without changing the medicine, with different names but the same reality. Internal and external troubles come one after another, the country is weak and the people are poor, and the future is bleak. As I see it, the reason for this is that a few (old sayings) are dominating the situation. Don't you believe it? Please see:</p>
<p>1.  (Each person sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs.) From then on, everyone is selfish and only knows themselves, harming the public for their own benefit. National affairs are not worth asking about.</p>
<p>2.  (If you are not in the position, do not meddle in its affairs.) From then on, even if those in power act arbitrarily and commit all kinds of evil, everyone still bows their heads and acts as obedient citizens. How can the country have a new atmosphere?</p>
<p>3.  (Moving once is worse than staying still.) From then on, people stick to the old ways and hate reform. Other cultures are progressing rapidly, but we can't catch up. How can we resist them?</p>
<p>4.  (Leave everything to fate, don't force it.) From then on, the rich just celebrate their wealth, and the poor just endure their poverty. Everyone lacks the spirit of brave struggle and upward effort, resulting in a stagnant, backward nation that is subject to being slaughtered by others.</p>
<p>5.  (Of the three unfilial acts, having no descendants is the greatest.) Even those who are so poor that they can barely afford to defecate hope for many sons and grandsons, so that the family line continues. From then on, there are too many people and not enough food, and everyone fights for food, making the situation even more unstable.</p>
<p>Only when no one believes in the old sayings above will China stand out.</p>

<p>After the news of Mr. Chaplin's arrival in Shanghai was announced, the general public has been eagerly awaiting him. However, Mr. Chaplin is still delaying his trip. Recently, he went to Japan from Hong Kong. According to Chaplin's interview with Hong Kong reporters, he said that his three most satisfying works are "The Circus", "City Lights", and "The Big Adventure". The first two films are well known to the people of Shanghai. The third film is a satire of society, which has now been purchased by the Paris Theater in this city for a large sum of money and translated into "Street Hero". It is scheduled to be screened on the 18th (today). Those who admire Chaplin can use this to "draw strength from imaginary plums." Chaplin's art in this film is like the rising sun, shining brightly. Its grand situation should not be less than "City Lights".</p>
