<p>竟誣我排外思想濃厚</p>
<p>圖挑起各國對我惡感</p>
<p>（日内瓦）松岡今（二十三）日在國聯行政院言中國排貨事時、</p>
<p>妄引中美往事　述及前美政府指中國對美之、抵制運動爲不規則不合法之外交方法、爲嚇詐之形式、爲中政府予以同情之仇視行爲、並責令當時中政府取締此運動等文件、松岡並稱、美政府爲實行其意見計、曾諭令太平洋艦隊準備行動、於是對美排貨運動、遂於二十四小時内終止、松岡又言中國屢次對日抵制事、謂此次運動、不能謂爲反對日本侵略而起、而渠頃所述之對美抵制、尤非反對美國海陸軍之侵略、松岡繼言顧博士所稱中國内地外倁絕少發生意外事變一節、謂行政院苟一注視此種意外事變之紀錄、則自可下一判語、日本屢請注意於過去十年來中國各學校、甚至各幼稚園中之排外鼓吹、一九○○年拳匪亂事、可爲前鑒、當時精神、與自前仇外宣傳之幕後精神適同、五十萬兒童之排外敎育、乃國聯所應立即處理之適當事件、如聽其長此不已、則世界將見中國發生一種運動、其劇激當十倍或二十倍於拳亂、爲中國人民自已利益計、中國領袖應覺悟此事之後果、中國人民即無此種敎育、已感不少困難云、松岡演詞翻譯後、松岡又發言、謂行政院某理事對於已故田中首相發嚴重之抨擊、但渠想各理事不能僅因有人控訴、而遽判定一人或一國另有罪也、行政院必須依照「在未證明日本有罪以前日本實爲無罪、」之規則行事、渠願將此語載入紀錄中、</p>
<p>否認破壞條約　松岡繼稱、日政府從未破壞任何條約、如屬必要、渠準備向行政院說明日本之意見、日本從未以堅强統一的中國爲慮、日本向來竭力贊助中國以恢復和平、蓋努力維持遠東和平、乃日本之大政策也、日本從未抛棄此政策、而盡人力所可及、以保全和平、中國常不根據事實、僅以不負責任之責言加諸中國、故意爲之、屢作不休、於是不獨聞者、即傳說者亦信此爲確矣、但此言旣在行政院中提出、則日本願有以證明之、渠須一再聲明者、日本未破壞現有任何條約、且受條約拘束、日本與美國同皆極願贊助中國之現有政體、日本曾保全中華民國、孫中山在生命危險時、固常避居日本也、</p>
<p>中俄防日聯盟　松岡言及中俄之防日條約與聯盟、謂俄國依據此約、得以迅速侵入滿洲、日本除奮鬭外、别無他道、日本雖爲自已生存而奮鬭、然奪還俄國所佔之滿洲部份而奉還中國、日本於此不應得人酬謝以答其戰爭之財政上鉅大擔負乎、苟日本在俄日戰爭結束時、早知有此秘密聯盟之存在、則渠想日政府必已要求割滿洲全部爲日本領土、果爾、則何致生今日之滿洲問題、將來能否不有再立秘密盟約、以危害日本生存之一日、此乃日人所未能確定者、</p>
<p>威嚇國聯勿躁　松岡末言用及顧博士請國聯施行迅速而有效力之辦法一節、謂日政府主張國聯宜有極深切之考慮、而勿遽作輕躁之行動、渠可爲行政院確告者、稍事延緩、不致使滿洲三千萬人民更遭流血等之苦楚、此三千萬人在實際上今已享受更大之福利、甚於遍地盜匪與干戈之中國境内四萬萬人民、中代表在行政院中所稱一再拖延、將增流血等痛苦一說、渠不能不認爲含有威嚇和平機關的國聯之意、渠願一再聲明延遲不致有此惡果云、松岡此次發言、比上次宣讀長文時、較爲激昂、會衆以深切注意聽之、尤以其言乃中國排外運動時爲甚、至於其言果爲衆所接受與否、則爲另一問題、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3 id="c5">顧維鈞嚴辭駁斥 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>田中奏章果係僞造</p>
<p>則定出日本人之手</p>
<p>抵貨而可稱爲戰爭</p>
<p>則甚歡迎日之排華</p>
<p>中國代表顧維鈞與日代表松岡相對而坐、當松岡演說時、顧代表默坐靜聽、面色異常安詳、調查團主任委員李頓爵士、坐於會塲之前排、當松岡演說、李頓欠身靜聽日代表之言論、</p>
<h3 id="c6">田中政策事實俱在當顧代表 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>立起答復時、全塲空氣突現緊張之象、顧代表首謂時間已晚、對於松岡所提出之各點、一時不及一一作答、俟下次會議再行補述、但彼對松岡所提出之數點、欲加說明、顧謂關於田中之奏章、松岡並未提及在該奏章中所述明之各節、確爲日本政府數十年來一貫之政策、田中確爲主張日本積極政策之一人、顧又稱、事實俱在、非空方所能搪塞、若田中之奏章果爲僞造、則亦係日人所僞造、因除日本人外、其他人等絕不能自行發明此項良好之政策、爲年來日本所奉行、其次顧維鈞又提出二十一條問題、顧謂最初日本官塲中尚否認該項條約之存在、認爲係中國方面所僞造、但其後乃自行承認、自此次經騐後、中國對於田中奏章、不能不惴惴於心、</p>
<p>日本排華固所歡迎　至於抵制日貨問題、顧稱、若抵制日貨爲變相戰爭、則中國甚歡迎日本之排華、而不歡迎日本之佔領東三省也、（至此全塲大笑）</p>
<h3 id="c7">援助統果若是乎顧繼謂日 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>本援助中國統一之方法果若是乎、若上海之戰事、砲攻毫無防禦設備之中國城市、及今日日本之攻擊反「對滿洲國」者等等、可謂援助中國統一乎、若眞欲援助中國之統一、當不致令中國最富裕之數省脫離中國、中央政府亦猶之個人方面、將某一家庭之一份子强擄而去、反謂如此係援助該家庭也、其次、顧因時間已晚、保留其未守部份至下次會議繼續述明、顧維鈞之演說、在會議塲中造成一有生氣之印象、因彼答履松岡所提出之各點、旣異常迅速、而彼於演詞中、又雜入詼諧、至彼本人並未一露笑容、</p>
<p>其次、松岡復起立答覆、請顧代表不必對田中奏章繼續爭辯、惟請顧對所聲言各節提出證據、末稱、「余提及此點、俾君於下次開會時可不至忘却、」云云（路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c8">顧代表再駁松岡 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政院今（二十四）日午後開會、顧維鈞博士首先發言、謂昨日日代表松岡所發之言論、内有許多點、渠不欲於目前駁斥之、因其係旁枝末節也、少緩將以書面覆文送交行政院、以免多費時間、渠不欲效松岡之所爲、而將主要問題擱置不提、以言田中奏章、此文之眞確、唯得入日本文書庫者、始能得其眞據、但此文眞確之最好憑證、即爲今日滿洲之時局、顧文至此、乃引證松岡所著「在運動中之滿蒙」一書、内有田中奏章或係日人所僞造等語、顧續稱、現當注重者、爲田中侵略政策之存在、行政院各理事不妨取田中奏章讀之、而與日本今日之政策相較、如是即可判定此文之關係矣、至於松岡所文俄日密約、則須知日本自已所定之密約甚多、有迄今爲人所不知者、其最著者、爲一九○九年一九一○年一九一二年及一九一六年之對俄密約、松岡所稱今日東三省人民較前更爲快樂一說、實非眞相、今年十一月九日與十日日飛機之轟炸村鎭及日步軍之攻擊村民、死者數百、試問何快樂之有、顧博士於是乃轉入正文、謂現有若干問題必須問答者、㈠九一八之事變、究爲日人自衛行爲乎、答語曰「否」、㈡「滿洲國」之成立、究爲當地人民自由志願之行爲乎、答語曰、「否」、㈢日本果已依照其屢次諾言撤退共軍隊乎、答語曰、「否」、㈣爭點果不可和平解决乎、答語曰「然」、以上要點、必須牢記勿忘日本違背九國公約、而與「滿洲國」締結盟約、事實毌須爭辯、事實之報告、即「李頓報告書」今在事人之前、如吾人不承認李頓調查團之斷論、則吾人將無從在共同努力中謀取解决方法、松岡陳訴日本所以不將此問題提交國聯之理由、察其所言、直謂一國之情感、乃國際爭議中判斷是非之唯一仲裁人、何者爲日本之解决希望乎、日本所希望者、乃中國有内訌、及世界各處有經濟難題之時機耳、日本所希望者在此、而此時機果於一九三一年九月中來矣、日本所欲之解决、乃日本須以其自已手腕解决此事耳、而其所謂解决、開端於瀋陽、華人之權利與全世界之和平、必須受日人之支配、試問如此舉動、果與今日世界之精神相適應乎、試問國聯盟約將被視爲廢紙乎、試問九國公約將被視爲不過一種簽名册乎、如吾人果欲用和平方法代替武力解决爭案、則吾人不能置日本之挑戰於不答也、顧博士演說之末段、以熱切之言論籲請會衆擁護國聯盟約、及國際和平公約、其言論甚引起行政院會議室中之極大印象、顧博士演說時、激昂情感之流露、與上次演說時逈不相同、（路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c9">日代表理拙詞窮 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>顧博士言畢就座、松岡即起而發言、首謂中代表在實際上現已承認未有證明田中奏章眞確之憑據、渠現信顧博士對於渠書中所稱此文係不負責任之日人所爲一節、予以同意、渠於是不得不詰問一國之負責代表列席於此行政院者、奈何提出其所不能證實之一種嚴重罪案、渠請行政院注意中代表所發中政府贊助排貨之承認、松岡至此、又請行政院注意李頓報告書之附件、内有政府關於排貨之秘密訓令等、松岡旋稱、顧博士責渠提出旁枝末節、但顧博士自已巧於閃避、似不欲與渠正面交鋒、何能責人、松岡駁斥顧博士對於主要問試話之答語、謂日本始終爲最擁護國聯之一國、有自已的行爲證明之、中國則於見有機會可利用國聯以求其目的時始擁護之、日本忠實擁護國聯、如日本覺其對於國聯之擁獲、不與其國家生存及其保持遠東和平之政策絕對抵觸、則日本希望永爲國聯之忠實擁護者、松岡末稱、渠保留日後提出書面意見書之權云、</p>
<p>於是主席凡勒拉宣稱、渠覺今晚會議如再進行、無益於事、渠希望明日當可進行李頓報告書之討論、但渠不顧不容兩造任何方面有陳述意見之適當機會、（二十四日路透社電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）今（二十三）日行政院會議、中日代表辯論後、主席凡勒拉即請李頓爵士加入行政院之席次、同時謂調查團各委員於聞頃間中日代表所中述之各節後、是否認爲調查團之報告有改正之必要、請調查團各委員迅速開會討論、在最短期間向大會報告、乃日蟘表重復起立、謂國聯調查團現已不復存在、故該團已無發表意見之資格、凡勒拉答稱、國聯調查團事實上仍舊存在、在未取消之前、當然有發表意見之權、松岡對此表示反對、謂彼不能接受此種辦法、主席答稱、此種辦法係屬慣例云云、中國代表顧維鈞對於請調查團發表意見一節、表示贊同、謂予該調查團以發表意見之機會、實屬正當、但主張調查團之集議、應俟彼對日本代表所述之各節完全答覆之後、凡勒拉至此乃表示接受、日代表松岡仍表反對之意、但稱、若日方之解釋果屬錯誤、則日代表願徹回反對之意、惟彼個人仍信日方之解釋爲不悮云、</p>
<p>凡勒拉稱、大會並無令調查團修正報告書之建議、惟調查團委員欲加以修正者、彼等亦可修正云、李頓爵士至此乃起立發言、謂自調查團各委員離華各返本國後、調查團尚未開會一次、據彼所知、大會請調查團各委員開會集議者、並非討論中日代表之意見、乃係令調查委員研究中日兩方代表申述之意見、是否可令彼等修正彼等所起草之報告書、然後再向行政院報告、故彼已决定於明日召集會議、討論是項問題、至此始悉李頓及各調查團委員等皆由凡勒拉約請參加行政院會議、但未坐於會議之席上耳、凡勒拉旋稱、在日本保留之下、行政院對於此項提議表不贊同、希望於最短期間内、該調查團能向行政院提出報告、日代表松岡至此又提出反對之意見、堅主行政院將日本反對之意見予以登記、</p>
<p>行政院其次即按序討論議程中之次列案件、此即爲但澤之幣制問題、</p>
<p>一般之趨勢、似行政院至少將再開會兩次、能决定進一步之辦法、但衆盼行政院之討論東省問題、能在本星期内獲得結果、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c30">如何援助僑胞之困厄 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 誠</p>
<p>今日報刋李馥蓀先生「南洋僑胞之現况與吾人應有之努力」一文。於南洋僑胞與我國内經濟之關係。及其艱難之現况。均有槪括之叙述。其最着目之點。爲呼籲國内經濟界予南洋華僑金融事業以實力之援助。以復興南洋僑胞之經濟力。李先生爲金融界領袖。此次又曾親往南洋作實地之考察。其所持論。自爲警關而切實。然而李先生所言。要僅爲救濟南洋僑胞要圖之一端。吾人則請更就見之所及。而一加申論</p>
<p>凡海波所到之地。無不有華僑之足跡。此語殆已爲世界所公認。而此輩僑胞之活動力。誠有如李先生文中所言「以赤手空拳造成工商業之基礎。」其對於祖國之貢獻。則更不僅如李先生所云「累年以來。貿易鉅數入超。恃華僑匯欵爲挹注。」與夫水旱饑饉。僑胞捐助亦多。一二八之。役踴躍輪將而已。孫中山先生會謂「華僑爲革命之母。」由此又可想見僑胞對於祖國革命貢獻之偉大。</p>
<p>然而近歲以來。僑胞之事業。顯然已日即於衰落。因之其對於祖國之貢獻雖仍極爲踴躍。但已漸感力不能支。據去年度中國銀行營業報告中有云。「自世界市面衰落。南洋各地商業凋敝。失業衆多。於是英荷兩國政府。設法限止華僑入口。···以至華僑移至南洋者日見减少。而回國者日見多。去年華僑匯入之欵。雖不得正確數字。大約不逾二萬萬元之數。較之民國十九年至少減去五千萬元。」不僅此也。由於祖國政治保護力之薄弱。各處僑胞所遭受極無理之待遇。更言之痛心。吾人如認爲僑胞之活動。占我國國民經濟極重要之地位。則目前各地僑胞所遭受之打擊。即不啻爲我國國民經濟遭受之重大則創傷。而僑胞生活之日即於艱難。又不啻爲我民族前途一可怖之陰影。</p>
<p>然而僑胞之所以遭受打擊。固亦絕非偶然。也洶湧澎湃方興未之世界經濟恐慌之狂潮。使各個資本主義國家日感市塲之緊縮。日感失業問題困難之增大。其影響所至。自必然的限制外人入境。限制外人之活動。甚且加以種種無理之壓迫。與凌辱。務使不能安於其生。故華僑經濟困難一問題自其正面視之。固似僅爲由於我國政治保護力薄弱所誘致。但自其實際言之。則與世界經濟恐慌之狂潮實緊相聯緊繫。</p>
<p>吾人今日。旣一時未能使政治臻於健全。以增大僑胞之政治保護力復不能奢望世界經濟恐慌之轉機。使僑胞生活。得以安定。是則吾人今日而言援救僑胞。要亦不過爲盡其力之所能。努力爲之而已。</p>
<p>李先生文中所舉之予華僑金融事業以實力之援助。即力所能者之一端也。此外吾人又請提出兩點。</p>
<p>一曰推進華僑敎育。敎育不僅深關乎僑胞之知識。抑亦深關乎其事業。蓋個人之奮鬥。少團結之活動。皆足以使僑胞活動失敗。則惟有推進其敎育。增進其團結力。此其一也。</p>
<p>二曰予僑胞以投資國内之安穩機會。海外之活動。旣已遭遇困難。則僑胞毌寗返而投資於國内。以扶植國内之工商業。然而目前我國内政冶未臻於健全。又爲僑胞投資最大之顧忌。是則我政府亟應努力於社會秩序之安定。與關於阻礙工商業進步之種種束縛之解除。予僑胞以安穩之投資機會。此其二也。</p>
<p>上述二者。則亦爲力之所能舉者也。就力之所能。踐實進行。促其實現。雖曰末道。僑胞未必遂因而得解脫其困厄。挽回其繁榮。但吾人欲竭盡人力以助僑胞。不當如是乎。</p>

<p>國民社二十三日華盛頓電　美總統胡佛今日於晤商國會議員之後、對於戰債問題、發一聲明書、給予歐洲以修改戰債之一綫希望、顧其修改、須視軍縮問題與世界經濟會議爲轉移、若欲策其救濟債務國財政之效、則亦甚㣲、且對於十二月到期之債務、並未有延長停付期之提議、足㣲依然不肯放棄也、惟主張債務國不妨以本國貨幣還債、可不必用美金一層、或能使債務國稍減苦痛也、</p>
<p>路透社二十四日華盛頓電　國務卿史汀生今日已答覆法英兩國關於戰債問題之牒文工</p>
<p>路途社二十三日紐約電、胡佛總統對戰債之决議、已使鎊價落至今年之新低度、價爲三·二四又八分之七、</p>
<h3 id="c88">戰債與軍縮有關 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>國民社二十三日華盛　頓電胡佛總統之聲明書全文長數千字、其主要建議、主張由國會組織一戰債委員會、與債務國討論全部戰債問題、其委員人選、應即以世界軍縮會議與世界經濟會議美代表充任之、此外又在敘述此項建議以前、聲明現行債務協定、必須維持、（易言之即本届到期之欵必須照付）、</p>
<p>至關於英法等國商請延長停付期或修正協定一層、胡佛總統曾說明其立場謂英法等國、未曾陳述、足以證明十二月到期債務應當延期之事實、彼僅僅提議停付十二月到期欵及兩政府從事討論戰債問題、而乏無力付欵之事實為佐證、在余視之、此種建議、殊無甚力量、余以爲美國人民、不應再請其續有犧牲、余必須重行申明、在美人心理中、戰債問題、與軍縮問題、及因競爭軍備而加於美人及他國人民之重負、俱有密切關係、故吾人必須開發一交相利益之重要大道云云、</p>
<p>胡佛總統聲明書發表後、法大使克勞台即赴國務院索取一份、未有評論、料各債務國代表在數小時內、當可各得一份、此外當選總統羅斯福、在出發赴溫泉休養前、亦由政府送去一份、又民主黨領袖於胡佛宣言書發出後、即羣回五月花旅館、與羅斯福會商此事、</p>
<h3 id="c89">戰債委員會性質 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>按胡佛總統建議、組織戰債委員會、實際不啻重設戰債基金委員會、授以與債務國談判之全權、然後報告談判結果及其建議於國會、委員人選、應以軍縮代表與經濟會議代表充任一節、可以視爲美政府非俟歐洲减縮軍備後、不允修改戰債之表示、又建議經濟問題、亦應一倂列入一層、、則實際上僅爲節省光陰起見</p>
<p>至胡佛總統提出此項建議原因、蓋昨日胡佛與羅斯福兩總統之晤談、既未得要領、今日與國會議員之會商、亦未臻同意、而胡佛又以任期將終、不願再肩負解决戰債問題之艱難工作、故將全部問題非正式移交國會處理、逆科將來國會開幕後、總統於報告一年來政務時、將正式提出此議也、至胡佛總統前本有贊成延長停付期之表示、此次忽改變態度者、則因國會議員、大都反對延長停付期之故、</p>
<p>至今日總統與國會議員會晤時情形、可謂無甚結果、事後共和黨參議員華生語人云、我輩未有同意者、又民主黨領袖雷賫聲稱、吾輩與總統同意者有二端、即戰債不應該再减讓或取銷、及十二月到期欵應當照付是也、又參議員哈禮遜聲稱、國會議員對於戰債委員會建議絕少熱忱</p>
<p>當今日總統見國會議員之後、財兵未爾士復往邀羅斯福再與胡佛總統會議一次、羅斯福託故婉謝、嗣羅氏在五月花旅館、與民主黨議員晤商後、即赴溫泉休養、至民主黨領袖會議情形、未有發表、</p>
<h3 id="c90">羅斯福發表意見 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>嗣羅斯福在火車中對人發表意見、謂美國與歐洲各國間之戰債問題、可由現有外交機關談判、不必改由國會或另組委員會辦理、又謂渠與胡佛總統、對於戰債問題、有許多地方、意見完全相同、但渠與總統會晤時、曾堅主英法等國、商請停付十二月到期欵一節、係現政府事務、又謂兩人完全同意、實在所借之數、必須償還、再債務國必須與美國分别談判、不能開一總會議、使債務國與債權國各站一方、因渠與胡佛總統、俱信此種談判、應視各國經濟情形及付欵能力、分别辦理、又戰債問題必向與德國賠欵問題、完全分離、將來必俟此層有明白聲明之後、美國始能與債務國開始談判云、</p>

<p>國民社二十四日倫敦電　自美拒絕英國停付戰債提議後、今晨英美匯價開盤時、頓由昨夜收盤之三元二角七分三一二五、跌至三元二角四分二五、而黃重價格頓漲至每盎斯一百二十六先令十便士、比昨日漲十一便士半、與去年十二月八日、空前最高價恰相、等</p>
<p>國民社二十四日巴黎電　美政府决定十二月十五日到期戰債、未能停付消息、抵此間後、頓令法人起痛苦印象、但報紙仍力圖減輕此事之重要性、顯恐其對於法國財政地位、與赫禮歐内閣地位、將發生重大影響之故、法國欠美戰債、照一九二六年協定、共六·八五○·○○○·○○○金元、分六十二年償清、其中本金三·八六五·○○○·○○○金元、本會計年度應付本息六○·○○○·○○○金元·本年十二月十五日應付息一九·二六一·四三二·五○金元、明年六月十五日再付利息一九·二六一·四三二·五○金元及本金二一·四七七·一三五金元云、</p>

<p>路透社二十四日倫敦電　英國各報評論、皆謂如美國堅持到期付欵、則無論其他債務國如何對付、英國必須咬緊牙齒、迅速還債、惟前途困難、亦爲衆所公認、十二月十五日到期債欵爲英金二千八百萬鎊、將有追加預算之必要、其數等於所得稅每鎊須增五便士、同時法國或將要求解除洛桑協定、蓋法國財長佛蘭亭在巴黎演說、曾謂或有重行召集洛桑會議之需要也、彙聞報稱、如時局應付不善、則將成歐美間長期之禍源、泰晤士報稱、如英國不履行債務、則全世界各債務國、皆將仿效、即私人欠債者、亦將有所藉口、果爾則後患不堪設想云、有數報主張英國用金還債、以此爲避免匯市大紊亂之唯一辦法、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日倫敦電　財相張伯倫今日在某處聚餐會演說、謂有人以爲英政府前因十二月到期之欠美戰債事致牒美國、今此牒結果毫無把握、此爲英幣匯價疲落之一原因、要知現並無可爲焦慮之理由、英國請求於英美兩政府討論此事時、暫行緩付、此非不合情理之提議、前洛桑議定之賠欵缓付、已使歐洲輿情立即受穩定影響、匯兌轉折之暫停、現爲全世界所必要、而洛桑解决所造成之信任、不應在討論開始時遽被擾亂、渠以爲討論實有益於雙方、英國現已付還短期債欵一萬三千萬鎊、英國貿易平衡、現較本年之初、已增八千六百萬鎊、而英帝國地位、亦逐漸起色、足見英幣價値之暫落、可無庸煩慮云</p>
<p>路透社二十三日倫敦電　胡佛總統戰債之宣言、英國負債方面、認爲尚堪滿意、胡佛總統視英國之請求、非不合情理、惟謂債務國尚未說明付欵應暫停止之事實、衆認美總統言頗中肯、故料英國將再致文美國、詳述此種事實與理由、英人以爲此種事實極多、且甚有力、蓋債欵照付、則匯率變動、經濟必擾亂、資金必流出、而一般信任必皆喪失也、</p>

<h3 id="c117">國聯開會後孫科之觀察談 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>▲國聯最後手段恐仍難免縣宕</p>
<p>▲日本退出國聯决不至成事實</p>
<p>▲我國應付難關惟望朝野一心</p>
<p>此次國聯召集會議、對李頓報告書、尚未經正式之考慮、而會議情形、即已陷入僵局、我方鑒於國聯屢次開會、均無切實辦法、遂宣言援引盟約第十六條、要求對日本加以制裁、而日本則更聲言脫退國聯、以爲恐嚇、同時更有因此而涉及南太洋國聯委託日本代爲管轄之島嶼問題、以致一般視察時局者、或有揣度、以爲日本態度如此强横、東北問題、恐非和平辦法所能解决、萬一國聯實行制裁時、則難免再有世界大戰之發生、然中委孫哲生氏、則不以爲然、茲分錄孫氏最近對國際形勢觀察之談話於後、</p>
<p>對國聯之預測　孫氏合新聲社記者之問、表示歐美各國之利害關係不同、而主張亦均各異、此次東北問題、本可實行制裁、然因英與美不能一致、法又與英不能合作、以致影響於國聯之對日、美國首先反對日本之侵略政策、當美國務卿史汀生氏發表不承認日本在東北之現事爲已成之事實之宣言時、英法等國、竟無何等表示、法國當時且暗中袒日、最近雖因軍縮問題、法已變更其袒日態度、然英法間對此問題、尤未能一致、日本亦利用其不一致以爲應付、此外尚有其他等等之不能一致、均係國聯對日本一時未必即行實行制裁者、依本人之觀察、國聯此次處理東北事件、恐難免仍事遷延、懸案於不了、</p>
<p>日本不致退出　孫氏對日本行將退出國聯說、表示一時不致實現、除非國聯有堅决之辦法、予日本以不利、然國聯旣不能取一致之制裁、則日之退出國聯、自非目前之事實矣、</p>
<p>世界二次戰爭　孫氏對世界二次大戰爭、認爲或係不可避免之事、然至少尚須有三數年之醞釀、戰事之發生、當看美國如何、美國旣未有準備戰爭之情形、曁華府會議時所允許美國之造艦程序、美國亦未有補充、然日本則拚死擴充海軍軍備、英國在東方亦頗示弱於日本、同時英國又因其他多數問題之牽制而無辦法、故外間雖有因國聯盟約第十六條之規定之嚴重、以及國聯方面因日本將欲脫退國聯、而注意及南太平洋國聯委託日本所代管之島嶼、而引起之第二次大戰之謠、實不致成爲事實也、</p>
<p>政府應有决心　孫氏最後謂國聯解决東北案、一時固難免使吾人悲觀、然其唯一之應付辦法、莫若政府負責諸人、齊下决心、與國民一致想出種種方法、如擴充軍備與積極抵抗、務使軍事與經濟、均有澈底的辦法等、方可制敵人於死命也、</p>

<p>中央社云、中日事件、國聯行政院、業已開會討論、日代表松岡·竭力在日内瓦活動、期以卸去日本違反國際公約之責任、以達到其武力侵略慾望、但各國出席代表、均洞悉其陰謀、對於破壞此國際公約之國家、决予以嚴厲之制裁、以維持正義、並保障世界之和平、中央社記者、昨就本埠外僑方面、除英美法意以外、探得其他各國對中日事件之態度如下、</p>
<p>西班牙　記者昨赴西班牙領署探詢、因該國駐滬總領事菲立Ｆerrer因公他出、當由副領事薩拉古基Sarracoechea代見、據談、中西邦交、素極和睦、敢云西班牙爲中國第一之好友、中西商約、自一千八百六十四年簽訂迄茲、兩國僑民、遵守信約、迄未發生若何事端、考查過去之事實、即可證明西政府對中國歷次事端、均有好感之表示、繼謂、西班牙僑民、現居中國境内者、共計七百人以上、在上海者二百八十餘人、商人及天主敎士居其大半、至中西貿易現狀、日臻親密、華貨運出、較勝於西貨輸入、依照民國十九年調查、西貨運華者僅五七·六零四海關兩、而華貨軍西、爲七九零·六四九海關兩、西貨以酒·軟木·橄欖油·魚·等爲大宗、華貨以茶·腸·錫·蛋·繡貨·磁器·古玩爲最、公使茄产杜Ｇarrido常駐北平、日來即將南下云云、</p>
<p>巴西　據巴西駐滬領事署發言人談、巴西人民之僑居於中國境内者、僅百人左右、在滬者約佔八十餘人、兩國間雖無深密之往來、但中巴邦交、始終和睦、中巴商約、自一千八百八十一年簽訂後、現因兩國間關係日密、亟須修改、故公使范路素Ｖelloss即將南下、晤羅外長、修改該項商約、巴西政府對於破壞國際公約之國家、始終表示憤慨云云、</p>
<p>瑞典　記者又赴麥賽而蒂羅路瑞典領署探詢、該總領事律立霍克Lilllehook因病在北蘇州路公濟醫院療治、不得要領、惟悉律氏病已漸痊、下星期三可出醫院、並悉瑞典朝野、對於此次日人之破壞國際公約、均表示憤慨、、而表同情於我國云</p>
<p>瑞士　瑞士駐滬總領事賴台Ｌardy將升任爲駐華代辦、明令雖尚未到滬、中瑞間關係之日密足證、該國僑民在滬約二百八十餘人、均屬商人、國際間各種機關、都設在瑞境、故該國政府及人民、均十分尊重國際間一切公約、總領事賴台、對中日問題、雖無明白表示、但其對華同情之表示、時流露於談話間、</p>
<p>墨西哥　墨西哥駐滬領事亞爾門Ａllman係一法律家、現在滬兼任律師職務、故渠對一切事務、均不欲多加評論云</p>

<p>〓下午練習〓</p>
<p>小作休憇、下午三時、赴跑馬廳球塲練習、小試脚頭、以去三日海行之困苦、攝影記者紛往爲之攝影前鋒五人、動作可觀、有鄭少康·孫錦順·黃美顺三人、加以中鋒霍威、用左冀巴德萊、實力不弱、後衛未見若何表演、不能作斷語也、</p>
<p>〓莫君談話〓</p>
<p>記者與香洪第一次從未過之華人領隊莫應桂君作談話莫君爲香港華人體育恊進進主席、告以港粤足球界之近狀、及港隊此次選擇之經過記之如次</p>
<p>香港隊之實力　港隊實力、前鋒不錯、有孫黃鄭三將、霍巴二人、殊佳美、但後衛不免遜色、華人一人皆未入選、如能加入南華一二將、當較强也</p>
<p>選擇未滿人意　港方對選擇之隊員、表示不滿意之態、第一次埠際意中隊、以三比零失敗於中西聯隊、第二次又以四比二敗於全華隊、合作不佳、最大原因如黃美順爲一中堅人材、而今以之充左内、恐難稱職、後衛人才、南華中華亦有之、但不能人選爲惜、余（莫君自稱）爲唯一之華人選擇委員、故無能爲力也、</p>
<p>港方足球近狀　南華中華在香港聯賽中、成績甚佳、南華僅失二分、故殊有得勝聯賽希望、自去年華人體恊會與港球會分裂而退出、今歲重行妥恊、港會對恊會、開始有相當之認識、</p>
<p>準備奪督憲杯　體恊會與港會、爲謀聯絡計今歲發起督憲杯比賽、恊會隊爲全華隊、港會隊則爲西人隊、三賽二勝、第一賽已定十二月中旬、南華中華正努力練習合作、</p>
<p>廣州情况慘落　廣州自陳策張惠長二君離粤後、情况一落千丈、海空二軍、皆不能成隊、只餕警察而已、故光鼐杯僅四隊參加、而警察隊雖有李天生譚江柏葉比華諸將、竟敗於嶺南大學、提倡體育、有後起無人之嘆、</p>
<p>願一觀中華隊　聞上海中華隊實力殊强、人才濟濟、星期日將與港隊作友誼賽、殊願觀賞、藉知上海足球界之進步</p>
<p>讚美體育評論　記者贈以上海體育記者多人合作出版之體育評論週報多份、及此次發行之埠際比賽特刊莫君贊美不已、謂國内體育出版物寥寥、願諸君竭力提倡、當爲之在港方竭力介紹云、３</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>國聯行政院考量中日爭端的時期臨頭了丨一般睡在繡着「乞助國聯」四字的遊仙枕上的人們，又在那裏做那種種的好夢了丨</p>
<p>日本的外交陷於孤立了丨世界各國除日本外都不承認滿洲國的存在了！法國忆湔除袒日的嫌丨而美國又實行承認蘇俄给予日本一種重大的威脅丨凡此種種，都是睡在遊仙枕上陸續湧現的甜夢。</p>
<p>夢境果能成爲事實麽？不見得吧。姑許其成爲事實，日本果以服從世界的公議麽？不見得吧。姑信其服從公議，淪陷經年的東北在省，果能無條件歸還中國麽？不見得</p>
<p>吧。姑認其無條件歸還中國，而始終倚人的中國獲此乞助國聯的佳果，從此可以一空倚傍蔚成旣富且强的國度麽？不見得吧。</p>
<p>與其乞助國聯，不如乞助聯！什麽呌已聯？便是自已人和自已人實行聯絡起來，收拾起私仇，宿怨，陰謀，暗算，以及其他鬭智，鬭力·爭城，爭地的鬩牆舉動。那麽中日爭端的結果，無論國聯怎樣的處分，而中國總可立於有勝無敗的地步。已聯兩字的權威，遠在國際聯盟的上面，貪做好夢的人們·快把這乞助國聯的枕頭閣置在一旁··而同時對於乞助已聯的工作，羣策羣力的完全鞏固起來丨</p>

<p>丨送林鵬俠女飛行家赴西北考察丨</p>
<p>我國自經九一八及一二八戰役以後，民衆深知中國缺乏空軍之不利於國防，海上爰有中國航空建設協會之組織，藉以喚起民衆，其意良善。我國人口之多，土地之廣，爲世界第一，但事事落後，致爲各國所輕視，曷勝感嘆？即以航空而論，美國一九三一年已有飛機一萬零六百三十五架，飛行員三萬五百零九人，其中女性佔五百地十人，英國大致相仿。東北有飛機二百五十餘架，猶不能保留一二，他處更無論矣。但中國航空人才，並非絕無，蓋人浮於事，航空家反無立錐地耳。政府辦理航空二十餘年，自袁世凱主持南苑航校迄今，除以大批現金，購入舶來飛機外，其他建設工作，一無可取，殊負民衆喁喁之望。茲者中國唯一女飛行家林鵬俠同志將有西北之行，各界歡宴無虚夕，吾人對女士此行，所以表示推崇者，絕非因其性情和藹，才識卓異，良以女士生於大族，養尊處優，大可不必䟦涉山川，深入陜甘新疆靑海諸省。今女士能犠牲物質享受，抱無畏精神，單身赴西北考察，中國女子有此抱負者，曾前見之否？然此猶不足道，當女士在英國習航空時，其飛行成績，能冠絕全英女飛行界，使西人側目，譽爲中國飛將軍，從此不敢輕視華人，則女士對於中華民族人格之貢獻，良足多矣。阿美瓊森造成英斐飛行之紀錄，政府奬勵與民衆宣傳，不遺餘力，我國雖被稱爲次殖民地之國家，亦有堪與阿美瓊森媲美者，然政府之奬勵何在？民衆之官傳何在？林同志雖一弱女子，其愛國觀念，遠勝鬚眉，本欲到滬參加抗日之戰，因和平條約，已經簽定，夙所抱負，未得如願。但東北義軍。仍在苦戰，西康糾紛，愈形惡化，新疆靑海均受影響，乃决定先赴西北，考察政治經濟及人民疾苦，並計劃開發之道，其志可嘉，其功殊偉，吾人惟祝禱其成功，爲國家爲民族爭光華焉。</p>
<p>偶然從杭友的口中，探得了杭州之江日報的王蘇香女士的死訊，於是我從帳惘而悲切的情緒中，想起了伊生前的一切：</p>
<p>王女士是浙江台州人，生得胖胖的身材，濃而闊的眉毛，厚而大的嘴唇，都充份地表現了伊那剛直的性情，勇敢的氣度；當革命軍從廣東發動時，</p>
<h3 id="c214">記一位女記者 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 廬松</p>
<p>伊便加入了革命工作，在一個師部裡充當了政治訓練員，據說是上尉以上的校官階級，在這時候伊便和一個參議項士元同志發生了戀愛，後來他倆同時偃武修文，在杭州市創辦了杭州市報，項先生做了編輯主任，而王女士便做了社長，於是王女士便毅然决然的和本夫離婚，而與項先生宣告婚姻上的正式結合了。</p>
<p>王女士擅口才，善交際，不論任何會場團體，都不不了伊的芳踪，眞是有會必到，每到必講，記得西湖博覽會開幕時期，上海新聞記者聯袂到杭，在杭州市政府招待記者席上，王女士妙語如簧，滔滔不絕，將上海的記者比做大鳥，杭州的記者比做小鳥，一時傳遍了滬杭各報，至今「鳥」之古典，在新聞記者的故事中，仍佔有一頁。</p>
<p>王女士不但是擅長普通的交際，而且是工於特殊的交際；杭州商會主席王竹齋先和理伊的乾爺，杭州前商民恊會主席孟祿久先生也是伊的乾爺，至於伊自已的乾女兒，更是多得不可勝計，像曾經轟動過京滬各報的著枸交際名花周文英女士，便也是伊的乾女兒之一。　　自從杭州申報停版後，伊倆又繼續接辦了之江日報，王女士是自作副社長，每天東奔西走，施其蘇張之舌，爲的是籌經濟，然而卒致精疲力盡，無法维持，遂將社長的名義，讓給了一位徐卓夫先生，而王女士本人，却　其辦報精神，幹那社會工作了。</p>
<p>王女士倒也是一個硬漢，爲了辦報，吃過好幾次官司，有一回，爲了和杭州電廠的糾紛，被該廠連帶控了訴三罪，丨竊盜，誹謗，誣告，丨羈押於浙江第一監獄者數月，當我往監獄中去探望伊時，伊那憔悴析面龐，絲毫不減剛毅之氣，後來卒賴莊崧甫陳果夫王竹齋諸老之力，而安然出獄了。</p>
<p>今年一二八事起，王女士組織了一個杭州婦女救護隊，在閔行的閔園設立了紅十字會分會，數月經營，任勞任怨，事後回杭，有人說伊是弄到了一萬多塊錢；但據伊自已的辯白，是依然未改其窮困的生活。</p>
<p>如今王女士是不幸的死了；社會上的人對伊的蓋棺定論，至少是分着幾種批評，一種是存着嘲笑的譏諷，一種是懷着欽仰而惋惜，前者，是未免刻薄，後者也太嫌遇當，在幾呢？總以爲這一朶社會的交際名花，果竟是死得太悽慘而可憐嫌</p>
<p>咧！</p>
<p>王女士死後，有人在建議着爲伊在杭縣梵村建立一個「　社」，每年舉行例祭，預料此事如果實行，那麽，湖山女俠的佳話，將不讓秋瑾專　於前了。</p>

<p>凡是看過中國近百年史的人·誰都知道那位因循誤國的葉名琛·他由廣東巡撫一躍而做兩廣總督，又拜大學士，名位眞可顯赫一時了，可是他爲人好大言，喜自負，一向不把高鼻頭人種放在眼裏，所以英法聯軍初入廣東時，他却處之泰然，若無其事一樣，雖然他的僚屬時時勸他亟謀抵禦方法，但他聽了只當做「耳邊風」扳謂不久自可平息，及至英軍進駐廣州，他孤掌難鳴·惟有俯首就擒，幸虧他臉皮還厚·不以被俘爲恥，雖然流徙至異邦·丨印度，他也能怡然自樂，有時與人寫字作畫·（署名海上蘇武）藉餬口腹，後來他也就老死在印度，世人爲追念他的偉績（？）都尊他爲六不主義的發明者，他的六不主義就是：㈠不戰，㈡不和，㈢不守，㈣不死，㈤不降，㈥不走，這六不主義自從他死後失傳了四五十年之久，直至去年九一八東北事件發生以後，才由他的信徒們一一重新實現起來，我想葉氏九泉有知，亦當掩面竊笑曰：「吾道不孤」！</p>

<p>「看牛啊！不是吹牛啊！」劉大格格地一陣冷笑。一頓夜飯，就在辯論終結以後，草草的了綫。劉大吸簡旱烟，去睡了。劉婆子繼續在未曾暗凈的天光下，把向日蔡剥</p>
<p>完，也去睡了。照留下阿根，還不睡，他也知道，就是去睡，也睡不着，不如去把一切安排舒齊了，然後去睡，睡得安穩些。等二老都有了鼾聲了，他悄悄地去收拾行囊，這行囊簡單得可笑，因爲棉衣還在蘇州的典當裏，非新米糶了錢，不能去贖。夏衣也不必帶了。只有一件已經補綴的棉背心，和一套衫褲，兩雙從城裏大户人家討來的舊襪，此外沒有了想着「出外要帶小雞錢」的老話，便偷偷地把娘的枕邊毛由包，一箍腦兒倒在袋裡，也只有大洋三兩，銀角四枚，總嫌太少，又在爺的床下一個破　裏，掏了好久，掏着帶有麥粒的鈔票兩張，一張是中國銀行五元票，一張是交通銀行的一元票，他還記得，這是賣掉愛姑去還債，餘剩下來的，是預備送給夏律師的書記而承蒙那書記垂憐原璧奉還的。兩下拚凑起來，十塊錢還缺六角幾十文，已經是」悉索敝賦」了。不知道明天二老發覺了這們的大　逃，要怎樣的登報緝拿咧！但是也顧不得許多，收拾好了，和衣在外間自已的床横下來，依舊不以胺睡，聽那門外瑟瑟索索地響，疑是天下雨了，下了雨，就横生枝節了，他細辨别，不是雨，乃是風吹着門外的榆樹，樹葉樹枝在屋角上擦拂。天亮了麽？不是，月亮的光太亮的原故，因此倒知道這時候是後半夜了老話說：『廿五六，月上四更足。」</p>
<p>劉大起來得早的，所以阿根在天色還未白亮的時候，的了小衣包輕輕地開門出去，加緊了脚步，一口氣去敲姜牛皮的門。姜牛皮起來開門，讓他進來，他的嬸娘睡眼矇朧地替他門燒滾水，泡粥，兩人吃飽了辭别了伊，到湖邊去候航船。</p>
<p>雖是時間不同，地位不同，離開故鄉去，換一種生活，是和當年愛姑在湖邊惘惘地立着，是一模一樣的。阿根想，伊還有我替伊提着小衣包，送伊，問伊「幾時還來「，我呢？···不容你再胡思亂想了丨善於把人搬來搬去，出許多閒是非來的蘇州班航船來了阿根要緊提了小衣包上船，出無暇再廻頭去望望背後的故鄉怎樣，直到離翠㣲村已遠，在迷濛的曉霧中，隱約照見湖邊有兩個人久立不去，不知道是不是爺和娘　？因爲他出曾經這們的久立在湖邊，悵望愛姑的遠逝的。</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>丨依賴與獨立丨</p>
<p>談到東方與西方，有一個顯著的不同點、便是偯賴性與獨立性。這二種根性造成二種不同的民族，丨柔弱與剛强。</p>
<p>在東方,不乏以布施乞丐爲唯一功德的慈善家,而西方的慈善家則反是,曾有一個中國人與一個西友同游杭州,杭州的乞丐甲天下,是三百六十行之外的一種特殊的職業,有不少窮苦的孩子,從小父母就敎以求乞的技能,使他滿街奔走,倘你游玩到杭州,你覺得唯一阻你清興的,那便是滿山滿街的乞丐,　　那時中國人與其西友同游至靈隱，有一個小孩向他們行乞，追隨有半里多路，起初大家不給，後來中國人終究是中國人，因不忍而丢给他一個銅子，那西友就說；『我剛才給他的敎訓，統給你毁了。這是他終身的問題，不是一個銅子的事。你這是害他，養成他的依賴性，不是救他』。言下不勝惋惜，同是一件事，同是爲計那小孩，就可以看出東西民族性的不同，西人重視「獨立」，而東方不免於「依賴」</p>
<p>更看器物方面，西方所發明的代步物是摩托卡，自由車，而東方所發明的代步物是人騎人式的人力車，這還是小事·再從其大者言之，西方對付人家的武器是「飛機」，「戰艦」，「坦克車」，自我主張，至東方所用以禦敵的武器是「絕食」，「通電」，「貼標語」，希望取得人家的哀憐，姑不問是一國的事，或是一個工廠的事，是否用「絕食」「通電」「貼標語」等弱者行爲可以取得勝利，這種事實，居然發現於二十世的政治史上，這不是奴隸性的表現，東方的恥辱嗎？</p>
<p>自去歲九一八東省淪亡以來，國人奔走呼號於列强之間，希望出來援助，猶如家遭盜刦，親人被殺，自已不能驅賊，而求鄰居出來捉盜追贓，世上寗有是理。現國聯調查團報告書已發表，所得的結論是「中國應由列强共管，」本來這一班碧眼紫髯的要人，那有工夫來完全替我國帮忙，所以列强之間要是有事也是爲自已的利益，公理兩字，不是二十世紀字典上所有。故一般依賴的迷夢，該是醒覺的時候了，要收回東北，要挽救國難，非全國上下抛去依賴之心，竭全力以直之不可，語云「天助自助」威邇遜說·「公理要以武力爲後盾」此言足夠我們玩味。</p>
<p>已往的「試騐」（據某要人言）已統告失敗，今後當以實力相週旋，告訴當局，國家已不堪一再「試騐」的了。</p>

<p>— 江學勤</p>
<p>我們平常吃麫饭時候，必須要把果子醬塗在上面，才覺得更有味些。可是市上所賣的果子醬，無論是香蕉的，是玫瑰的，或者其他種種，牠的價錢都是很貴的，就是起碼貨，也得四五角錢如此看來，實在很不經濟，必得自已能製，才可不化多的金錢而得多量的果子醬。這雖屬小藝，但對於我們經濟不無裨益。而且果子醬製法，旣無須高深的學理，又不要精㣲的藝術，少具一點烹飪化學常識的人，都可以着手來製造。在下曾實地製過幾次，成績均甚美滿，閱者若有興趣，依照下面所寫的製法試之·一定可以使你滿意。</p>
<p>製法就是先把買來的蕃枷，（以全紅色爲最好也不要過於太熟）放入一個鐵鍋内，鍋内倒下適量的清水，用火加熱，使牠起化學作用，祇要十多分鐘，牠的内部肉　就漸漸膨脹，外皮就自會製開，這時就用鐵池把牠一個個取出，放到白磁盆裏面，等牠冷後，就用手把牠的名面剥去，然後就將這剥去皮的蕃枷，連同流出，在磁盆裏面的液汁，又一同放入鐵鍋内，仍用火加熱，再過十分鐘後，就放下白糖，（紅糖出可）以可口爲席，同時放入少許桂花露，使其㣲有香氣，這樣一齊放入以後，就要以鐵棒或鐵池不停的攪拌，使其混和均匀，並要使其不至黏到鍋底，等牠成濃液體，變成醬色，把牠取出，封入瓶内或罐内，就可使用。</p>
<p>我們只要用五斤蕃枷，一斤糖，就可製出果子醬五罐，論其價值，所化不到半元，這不是比市上所買的要便宜幾倍嗎？伹是我們要曉得，用白糖加入製成者其色鮮紅，用紅糖加入製成者其色紫紅，加入少許香蕉露，就成爲香蕉果子醬，加入少許攻瑰露，就成爲玫瑰果子醬，這種種不同之點，均與果子醬的本質無關，製者願意那一種，就可以製那一種。</p>
<p>講到蕃枷果子醬的功用，不僅適於口味，因這蕃枷含維牠命最多，我們常常食之，大可滋補身體，並且能治療脚氣病及一切濕氣等症，這是我們是所應該知道的。</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>他再容忍不住了，于是很和婉而又很悶鬱地對伊說：「若妍，你須知道，現在的人，並不如你所意像的那麽可靠呵！若說要我犠牲麽。那到並不成問題，只要他果不差，你果能將來獲得幸福！不過我想，他！克昌，出不過是那麽平庸的一個男子！而肯你也應該想到我倆相愛的歷史喲！···若妍，你靜腦地想想吧！</p>
<p>他沉痛地說後，便提起兩隻笨重的腿，埀着頭，一步步地在室内踱來踱去：若妍似乎毫無感覺的在看他的書，室内是死一般的沉寂，窗前習習的風聲，淅瀝的雨點，都在助漲他的心潮，好似在奏着勝利之曲，也好似失意者的低訴。</p>
<p>他再也耐不住。這死的沉寂了，于是他再衧說一句：「若妍，你靜腦地想想吧！」他並不等候伊。的回答·便挾着大册的稿子出去了。</p>
<p>「這有什麽好想·難道要我跟你　死不成！」他剛剛前脚踏出房門·伊畢竟開口了，這說話顯然是「剌、」不·簡直像利刀似的裂割他的心肝。</p>
<p>誰都知道·而且羨慕·友石與若妍美滿的過去</p>
<p>當他倆同在Ｃ城Ｋ校唸書的時候·他的才學是那麽優勝·伊雖然學問並不怎樣好·可有那段嬝嬝嬌艶的身材·也算是全校屬目的校花·因了幾次遊藝會的接觸·他倆便由同學而進爲朋友·由朋友而進爲愛侶了·當他倆結婚的當兒，誰不是那麽說：「才子佳人·天成眷屬！」就是他倆自已，又何嘗不憧憬着永恒的幸福，尤其是友石。</p>
<p>可是環境却偏偏那樣捉弄人，他在學校裏的時候，雖不敢說將來定有如何的希望，介何曾想到竟沒有飯吃，又何曾想到若妍如此的突變！他離開學校，單憑了他的硬本領，去追求生活，去謀覓職業：可是那裏曉得這種鬼的社會，竟全沒有他插足的餘地，幾次碰壁以後，他深深地感到單憑本領是不行了，于是也想學學人家的鑽營·可是他畢竟是一付硬骨頭，怎樣也學不會·承奉，謟媚，哀求人家麽，那可寗願餓死，于是他更窮措了，于是天妻間便時常掀起鬧窮的波浪。</p>
<p>克昌是他倆的舊同學·他在學校裏，原是有名的耍公子，不但友石看不起他，就是若妍也常說他是雙料紈袴子，自然不在眼下，可是他畢業以後，仗着他哥哥是××府的秘書，他也就毫不費力的跟着做起官來了，那就證明了他畢竟是現社會的勝利者。</p>

<p>那可套了克昌的設計：『借點錢算什麽，拿去好了丨」于是克昌更有機會的常常光臨了，于是友石的家庭也就熟鬧起來了，于是·于是若妍也就儼然是克昌的愛人了，</p>

<p>其後，不知是克昌失了業，沒有了錢：抑是别種原因，若妍竟被陷落到了火坑似的妓寮，友石同位朋友去××路買點東西，是黃昏時節，正在彳亍着邊走邊談，驀地裏對角走來一角女人，倉皇地抓牢友石的衣袖：</p>
<p>「親愛的友石！我是你的妻子·！若妍，請恕我吧！」</p>

<p>— 孫源</p>
<p>本來也不用打鐘了·一起只有三個人，只要說一聲「開會了」就是了，何必打鐘·但學校好像要擺牠的威嚴，非打他一下鐘不可。</p>
<p>校長張慌地從圖書館奔到操塲，從操塲奔到講堂，好像不信只有那麽三個人聽講，還想也許有人在圖書館裏看書看出神沒有聽見鐘聲，成許有人在操塲上玩得沒有鐘聲聽清，所以去兜了一圈。</p>
<p>顯然的，各處都是靜靜的·整個的學校在今天丨星期日像睡着一般。</p>
<p>我們三人坐了三排下，有四個人，還有一個是學校的裏的書記，校長拖來「把塲面」的，我想信，要是我們的阿大丨茶役今日穿件長衫的話，一定也被校長拉來「把塲面」了。</p>
<p>門開了，校長進來了，隨後跟着我們早已在公佈板上見到的他尊姓大名的×博士。</p>
<p>校長介紹了後，曲解地說聽講的人數少，因爲大槪是昨日發生這件不幸事的影響。這顯然的，三歲小孩也不會想信。</p>
<p>其實，老實說平時上課，要是聽得不高興，這輩公子哥兒們趁敎授轉背在黑板上寫字的時候，低了頭，弓了身，</p>
<p>敏捷地輕輕的向門外一溜大吉，那一輩小姐們也提起了穿着高跟鞋的脚尖，讓臀部顫動着趕着也向門外一溜。</p>
<p>何况今天是星期日，星期日就是說「玩」日，誰願意呆板地坐在這裏聽鳥講。學校當局爲增進學生智識起見，在星期日開演講會的企圖，顯然是失敗了。</p>
<p>「可惜這輩同學這樣好的演講沒有聽到，可惜！可惜！」講畢後，校長接連的幾個「可惜」表示替這輩同學非常惋惜。</p>
<p>「最好把演講會改開跳舞會，就有人來了。」我走出了講堂對×君說。</p>
<p>眞的，只有把演講會改開跳舞會才有人來！</p>

<h3 id="c260">觀光陸總統夢後 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 大哉</p>
<p>昨日同一位朋友，跑到光陸，看美國滑稽新片「總統夢」我看的一天係最後一天，所以在我以前，在光陸及蘭心看見這張片子的至少亦有上萬的人。我現在要同觀過這張片子的人們，借申以政治爲背景，用詼諧諷剌的作風，來表示政治腐化的可能性的。</p>
<p>這張片子的本事大槪是這樣的：四個「政治掮客」要想抬一位「閱閥世家」的勃萊爾上台做總統，但勃萊爾沒有「應世之才。」後來華盛頓來了一位賣藥的醫生，大槪是走方郎中之類。而他能說能唱，行動滑稽，而且面貌舉動，與勃萊爾一般無二。於是那四位政治掮客，就想用他作總統選舉運動的「槍手。結果他答應了，而且周游全國，奏凱而歸。勃萊爾因白宫之夢已將實現，就想拿「槍手」除掉，結果因他們二人，面貌一般無二，所以勃萊爾命他的死黨將那「槍手」綁去放到北冰洋荒島的時候，反而將他自已綁了去而那「槍手」因爲事已至此，動了「爲國爲民」的愛國心，就登了總統的大位。</p>
<p>賣藥的醫生作大總統，是沒有什麽希奇的：所謂將相本無種男兒當自强，</p>
<p>您不看中國賣布的，賣魚的，都做過大總统麽？但是用議院房子作布景，又扮演全國政治會議的選舉狀况，做得惟妙惟肖，實在有些侮辱政府的尊嚴。若在我們中國·那作這片子的，實屬「罪所應得，死有餘辜。」况且使革命先烈，如華盛頓，林肯等等，都從油畫裏，說起話來，唱起歌來，尤屬荒謬絕倫，罪不容誅。我不懂這張片子，怎麽會在美國電影檢查委員會通過的。</p>
<p>我少時在學校讀政治學，書中明明寫出各國選舉制度中的弊端，如何用選區的特别支配，以及各種機巧方法，可使一個無道德而有作爲的人，一步一步的進而爲一縣或一州的主腦。但又自圓其說，而謂一國的元首，可不是這樣的，因爲一國的人生，絕對不許這種人，忝居萬民之上的。這句話未免有些矛盾，因爲一州之民，可以容納一位無道德有智謀的人，作他們的州長，爲什麽一國的人民，就不能容納呢？</p>
<p>做大總統，就做大總統，而不定要忸忸怩怩，說怎麽爲國爲民，眞是駡盡了世界上一切的政治運動者。大鼻子的是可人，因爲要在許多高帽子（大禮帽）之中，尋找他那頂可以掀得扁的大禮帽，而將所有的一切掀不扁的禮帽，通通掀扁了，而他掀得扁的高帽，反而高高的戴起來·亦有很深刻的寓意。伸者一曲而不能再伸：曲者倒隨時能曲能伸：並且能打倒了一切讓我來出風頭。妙哉妙哉。</p>
<p>編者附註光陸的「總統夢」已經過去了，這篇文字，亦未免有些「明日黃花；」但因爲他不是片評，而是用政治眼光來觀察影戲片的所得。本來影戲係歡喜下意識娱樂的工具，許多「士大夫」看了電影，回去同兒女講講，誰肯去在報紙發表看電影的意見呢？所以我就以「以少爲貴」的通例，將他發表了出來。不敏</p>

<p>當他走過倫敦街市，好些人對着他大聲喊着，「把你的眼鏡戴上。」羅克報以㣲笑。於是一片的喝采聲籠罩住他倆。實際羅克的一副大眼鏡，只有框緣，而沒有鏡片。但是他們見慣了銀幕上的羅克，一旦見了不曾戴上大眼鏡的羅克，出現在市街上，幾乎倒轉要疑心他是冒牌羅克了。怪不得羅克說：「我時常和剛從電影院裏出來的人們談話，爲了他們都不認識我的緣故，所以他們能夠儘量地把想到的話，對我坦白地說。有時他們說羅克是偉大的，有時他們說羅克不見得如何好。」</p>

<p>丨製片公司訪問記之五</p>
<p>藝聯公司的發起和主持的人，黃漪磋君說：「藝聯云者，就是把全國藝術界聯合起來，去和外國資本主義者對抗···」這是藝聯的立塲。而今後製片的計劃呢？當然也是本着它的立塲，發展出來。因此，藝聯公司一成立，使全體人員浩浩蕩蕩地到廣西去，然望在國產電影史上·留下最偉大的一頁：同時也是給目下的國產片，打出一條新的光明之路。</p>
<p>藝聯公司這次到廣西去拍戲，得到廣西省政府種種物質上的帮助，他們也大胆地預備攝製一些國產片從前所未有的東西。這是最値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>現在據記者調查所得，關於藝聯的製片計劃，在這裏報告出來··</p>
<p>一「猺山艶遇記」，是由廣西省政府指派猺山駙馬黃雲煥作嚮導，深入猺族所居的山中，實地攝製的。二，「空戰艶史」，已得到廣西民航局供給飛機及其他的帮助，將來片成，當開國產片的新紀錄。三，「黑將軍」和「主義」這兩部戲，是帶着濃厚的民族色彩的。四，「禍水」是以「名勝甲天下」的桂林山水，作爲背景而攝製的情片。五，「新廣西」是一部把廣西的名勝，文物，鑛區，林墾，以至國防軍備，建設等作有系統的介紹的帶點新聞性質的影片。</p>
<p>以上幾部片，雖然還在趕製中，成功與否，尚未敢斷定。但，藝聯這種進取和創造的精神，在國產電影史上，確是値得丹書的。而藝聯公司到廣西去的人員，除了黃漪磋，王次龍。楊小仲等影界的舊人物外，其餘如許曼麗，葉靑靑，梅琳，羅慕蘭等均係新進的人物。現在我們在這裏期待着到廣西去的藝聯公司的凱旋丨</p>

<p>練習眼光的最好時間·是在太陽初吐曙光的時候。在空氣最清潔的地方。但是·切不可因噎廢食，因爲你的環境不許你有這樣合適的時間與地點，你就不敢練了。不論怎麽樣不合適的環境都阻擋不住有志無力的人底窮練與苦練，不過有兩件事是不可不注意的。第一空氣過於不潔的地方，不應當練。第二光線過於不足的地方也不應當練。</p>
<p>在初練的時候，最好是用一枝鉛筆，在兩眼之間，鼻樑中心·點上一個小小黑點。你站的地點，必須離開鏡子一尺左右。（不妨稍遠。）站成兵式體操裏的立正姿勢。眼光正對着鼻樑中心的一點。先將胸中濁氣盡量吐出，然後徐徐由鼻管裏吸進一口空氣·吸氣的聲音以不讓自已的耳朶所見爲度。開始吸氣時，心中黩數「一·二·三·四·五·六·七·八。」數到「八」字，恰恰　吸滿一口氣，由「一」數起的時候，你的眼光僅僅看見鼻樑中心的一點·模模糊糊的看不清楚。逐漸數到「八」字，眼光就逐漸的增加數到「八」字的時候，眼光已由模糊·平視·漸進而爲注意了。</p>
<p>將這一口氣和注意的眼光留住。由「一」慢慢地數到「八」。然後徐徐由鼻管呼出這一口氣·出是由「一」數到「八」。數完八個字恰恰呼守一口氣。呼出的時候，你的眼光也是逐漸的减縮·由注意·平視，而漸漸降到模糊看不清的地步。</p>
<p>練完一遍之後，不妨休息一分鐘·然後再練第二次。初學者每一式不得練到三次以上。</p>

<p>Geneva: The members of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry convened at the League of Nations Secretariat at 11:00 this morning to discuss how to respond to criticisms of their report. The meeting adjourned at 12:15, and resumed after a quarter of an hour. During the adjournment, Lord Lytton remained alone in the room, writing diligently, presumably drafting the meeting minutes for consideration and approval by the other members. The general impression is that the Investigation Team is unlikely to revise its report. Judging from recent developments, Lytton will complete the written reply today and submit it to the Executive Yuan. If the arguments presented by the Chinese and Japanese representatives do not necessitate further consideration by the Investigation Team, Lytton will present his opinion to the Executive Yuan this afternoon.</p>
<p>Another telegram: The meeting of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry ended at 1:00 PM. It is now known that Lord Lytton does not intend to submit the written reply to the Executive Yuan before Thursday, so that the Investigation Team can hold another meeting after listening to the arguments of Gu Weijun and Matsuoka. If their arguments do not require the Investigation Team to change its decision, it can be asserted that the Lytton Report will not be revised. It is heard that the members of the Investigation Team believe that their report was the result of months of research and unanimous decision, and that the arguments heard today are insufficient to change their opinion. (Reuters telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The members of the Investigation Team held a closed-door meeting at 10:00 AM on the 24th to discuss the opinions expressed by the Chinese and Japanese representatives at the Council regarding whether there were any points in the report that needed correction. The result was a decision that no modifications were necessary. (Domei News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Gu Weijun Engaged in Two Verbal Battles with Matsuoka.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Japanese Representative Uttered Wild Claims, <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Accusing Us of Strong Xenophobic Sentiments,</p>
<p>Attempting to Incite Other Countries' Animosity Towards Us.</p>
<p>(Geneva) Matsuoka made the following remarks at the League of Nations Executive Council today (23rd) when discussing China's boycott of Japanese goods:</p>
<p>Baselessly Quoting Past Sino-American Affairs: He mentioned that the former American government had pointed out that China's boycott movement against the United States was an irregular and unlawful diplomatic method, a form of intimidation, and an act of hostility to which the Chinese government was sympathetic. He also ordered the then-Chinese government to suppress this movement. Matsuoka further stated that, in order to implement its demands, the American government had ordered the Pacific Fleet to prepare for action, and as a result, the boycott movement against the United States ended within 24 hours. Matsuoka also spoke about China's repeated boycotts against Japan, saying that this movement could not be said to have arisen in opposition to Japanese aggression, and that the boycott against the United States he had just mentioned was even less directed against American military aggression. Matsuoka went on to say that with respect to Dr. Gu's claim that accidental incidents rarely occurred in the Chinese interior, if the Executive Council were to pay attention to the records of such accidental incidents, it could come to a judgment. Japan has repeatedly called attention to the anti-foreign propaganda in Chinese schools, even kindergartens, over the past decade. The Boxer Rebellion of 1900 can serve as a warning. The spirit at that time was identical to the spirit behind the current anti-foreign propaganda. The anti-foreign education of half a million children is a suitable matter for the League of Nations to address immediately. If this is allowed to continue, the world will see a movement in China that is ten or twenty times more extreme than the Boxer Rebellion. For the benefit of the Chinese people themselves, Chinese leaders should realize the consequences of this matter. Even without this education, the Chinese people already feel a great deal of hardship. After the translation of Matsuoka's speech, Matsuoka spoke again, saying that a certain council member of the Executive Council had made a serious attack on the late Prime Minister Tanaka. However, he believed that the council members should not hastily judge a person or a country as guilty merely because someone had accused them. The Executive Council must act in accordance with the rule that "Japan is presumed innocent until proven guilty." He wished to have this statement recorded.</p>
<p>Denying Violation of Treaties: Matsuoka continued, stating that the Japanese government had never violated any treaty. If necessary, he was prepared to explain Japan's views to the Executive Council. Japan has never regarded a strong and unified China as a concern. Japan has always strived to assist China in restoring peace, as striving to maintain peace in the Far East is Japan's grand policy. Japan has never abandoned this policy and has done everything in its power to preserve peace. China often levels irresponsible accusations against China, without basis in fact, and does so deliberately and repeatedly. As a result, not only those who hear it, but even those who hear of it, believe it to be true. However, since this statement has been made in the Executive Council, Japan is willing to prove it. He must reiterate that Japan has not violated any existing treaty and is bound by treaties. Japan and the United States both sincerely desire to assist China's existing political system. Japan preserved the Republic of China. When Sun Yat-sen's life was in danger, he often took refuge in Japan.</p>
<p>Sino-Russian Anti-Japanese Alliance: Matsuoka mentioned the Sino-Russian anti-Japanese treaty and alliance, saying that Russia, based on this treaty, was able to rapidly invade Manchuria. Japan had no choice but to fight. Although Japan was fighting for its own survival, it seized back from Russia the part of Manchuria it had occupied and returned it to China. Should Japan not be rewarded for its enormous financial burden in the war? If Japan had known of the existence of this secret alliance at the end of the Russo-Japanese War, he thought the Japanese government would have demanded the cession of the entire Manchuria as Japanese territory. If that had been the case, how could the Manchurian problem of today have arisen? Whether there will be another secret alliance in the future to endanger Japan's survival is something the Japanese people cannot determine.</p>
<p>Intimidating the League of Nations Not to Be Rash: Matsuoka finally mentioned Dr. Gu's request for the League of Nations to implement swift and effective measures, saying that the Japanese government advocated that the League of Nations should give extremely careful consideration and not take rash actions. He could assure the Executive Council that a slight delay would not cause the 30 million people of Manchuria to suffer further bloodshed. These 30 million people are now enjoying greater welfare than the 400 million people within the borders of China, where there are bandits and warfare everywhere. He could not help but believe that the Chinese representative's statement in the Executive Council that repeated delays would increase the pain of bloodshed contained the intention of intimidating the League of Nations, a peace organization. He wished to reiterate that delay would not have this adverse effect. Matsuoka's speech this time was more impassioned than his previous reading of a lengthy document. The audience listened with great attention, especially when he spoke of the Chinese anti-foreign movement. As to whether his words were accepted by the audience, that is another matter. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Gu Weijun Sternly Refuted, <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>If the Tanaka Memorial Was Indeed a Forgery,</p>
<p>Then it Must Have Been Created by the Japanese.</p>
<p>If a Boycott Can Be Called Warfare,</p>
<p>Then Japan's Anti-Chinese Boycott is Most Welcome.</p>
<p>The Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, sat opposite the Japanese representative, Matsuoka. While Matsuoka was speaking, Representative Gu sat silently and listened attentively, his face unusually calm. Sir Lytton, the chairman of the Investigation Team, sat in the front row of the venue. While Matsuoka was speaking, Lytton leaned forward and listened attentively to the Japanese representative's remarks.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Facts of the Tanaka Policy are All Present. When Representative Gu <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Stood Up to Reply, the Entire Venue Suddenly Became Tense. Representative Gu began by saying that it was late, and he would not be able to answer all the points raised by Matsuoka one by one at this time. He would add to them at the next meeting. However, he wished to clarify several points raised by Matsuoka. Gu said that regarding the Tanaka Memorial, Matsuoka had not mentioned that the points stated in the Memorial were indeed the consistent policy of the Japanese government for decades. Tanaka was indeed a person who advocated a proactive Japanese policy. Gu also said that the facts were all present and could not be brushed aside by empty words. If the Tanaka Memorial was indeed a forgery, then it was also forged by the Japanese, because no one else other than the Japanese could have invented this excellent policy, which Japan has followed in recent years. Secondly, Gu Weijun raised the issue of the Twenty-One Demands. Gu said that initially Japanese officials even denied the existence of the treaty, considering it to be a forgery by the Chinese side, but later they themselves admitted it. After this experience, China could not help but be apprehensive about the Tanaka Memorial.</p>
<p>Japan's Anti-Chinese Boycott is Indeed Welcome: As for the issue of boycotting Japanese goods, Gu said that if boycotting Japanese goods was a disguised form of warfare, then China welcomed Japan's anti-Chinese boycott but did not welcome Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces. (At this point, the whole venue burst into laughter.)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Is This the Kind of Assistance Given to Unity? Gu Continued that Was the <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Japanese method of assisting China's unity like this? Is the bombardment of Chinese cities without defensive equipment during the Shanghai War, and Japan's attacks on those opposing "Manchukuo" today, etc., considered assistance to China's unity? If they truly want to assist China's unity, they should not allow China's wealthiest provinces to secede from China. The central government is like an individual who forcibly takes away a member of a family and then says that this is assistance to that family. Secondly, Gu reserved the remainder of his remarks for the next meeting because it was late. Gu Weijun's speech created a lively impression in the meeting venue, because his answers to the points raised by Matsuoka were both unusually swift and he incorporated humor into his speech, while he himself did not reveal a smile.</p>
<p>Secondly, Matsuoka stood up again to reply, asking Representative Gu not to continue arguing about the Tanaka Memorial, but to provide evidence for the points he had stated, ending by saying, "I mention this point so that you will not forget it at the next meeting," etc. (Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Representative Gu Refutes Matsuoka Again <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council met this afternoon (24th). Dr. Gu Weijun spoke first, saying that there were many points in the remarks made by the Japanese representative Matsuoka yesterday that he did not wish to refute at present, as they were minor details. He would submit a written reply to the Executive Council shortly to save time. He did not wish to follow Matsuoka's example by setting aside the main issues and discussing the Tanaka Memorial. The authenticity of this document could only be verified by those who have access to Japanese archives. However, the best proof of the authenticity of this document is the current situation in Manchuria. Gu then quoted from Matsuoka's book "Manchuria-Mongolia in Motion," which stated that the Tanaka Memorial might have been forged by the Japanese. Gu continued, saying that what should be emphasized now is the existence of Tanaka's policy of aggression. The council members of the Executive Council should read the Tanaka Memorial and compare it with Japan's current policy. In this way, they can judge the relationship of this document. As for Matsuoka's mention of the Russo-Japanese secret treaty, it should be known that Japan itself has concluded many secret treaties, some of which are still unknown to the public. The most prominent of these are the secret treaties with Russia in 1909, 1910, 1912, and 1916. Matsuoka's claim that the people of the three northeastern provinces are happier now than before is not true. The bombing of villages and towns by Japanese aircraft on November 9th and 10th, and the attacks on villagers by Japanese infantry, resulted in hundreds of deaths. Where is the happiness? Dr. Gu then turned to the main text, saying that there were several questions that must be answered: 1. Was the September 18th Incident an act of self-defense by the Japanese? The answer is "No." 2. Was the establishment of "Manchukuo" a free and voluntary act by the local people? The answer is "No." 3. Has Japan withdrawn its troops in accordance with its repeated promises? The answer is "No." 4. Was the dispute not amenable to peaceful resolution? The answer is "Yes." The above points must be firmly remembered and not forgotten. Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty and concluded an alliance with "Manchukuo." There is no need to dispute the facts. The report of the facts, the "Lytton Report," is now before everyone. If we do not acknowledge the conclusions of the Lytton Commission, we will have no way to seek a solution through joint efforts. Matsuoka stated the reasons why Japan did not submit this issue to the League of Nations. Judging from his words, he directly stated that the emotions of a country are the sole arbiter in judging right and wrong in international disputes. What is Japan's hope for a solution? What Japan hopes for is an opportunity for internal strife in China and economic difficulties around the world. Japan hopes for this, and this opportunity came in September 1931. The solution that Japan desires is that Japan must resolve this matter with its own hands. And its so-called solution began in Shenyang. The rights of the Chinese people and the peace of the world must be subject to the control of the Japanese. Is such an action in line with the spirit of today's world? Will the League of Nations Covenant be regarded as waste paper? Will the Nine-Power Treaty be regarded as nothing more than a signature book? If we truly want to use peaceful methods to replace the use of force to resolve disputes, then we cannot leave Japan's challenge unanswered. At the end of his speech, Dr. Gu earnestly appealed to the audience to uphold the League of Nations Covenant and the international peace treaty. His remarks made a great impression in the Executive Council's meeting room. The outpouring of passionate emotion in Dr. Gu's speech was very different from his previous speech.

<p>After Dr. Gu finished speaking and took his seat, Matsuoka stood up and spoke, beginning by saying that the Chinese representative had now effectively admitted that he had no evidence to prove the authenticity of the Tanaka Memorial. He now believed that Dr. Gu agreed with his statement in his book that this document was written by irresponsible Japanese. He then had to question how a responsible representative of a country attending this Executive Council could raise such a serious case that he could not prove. He asked the Executive Council to pay attention to the Chinese representative's admission that the Chinese government supported the boycott. At this point, Matsuoka asked the Executive Council to pay attention to the appendix to the Lytton Report, which contained secret government instructions regarding the boycott. Matsuoka then said that Dr. Gu accused him of raising minor details, but Dr. Gu himself was good at dodging and seemed unwilling to confront him head-on. How could he blame others? Matsuoka refuted Dr. Gu's answers to the main questions, saying that Japan has always been one of the most supportive countries of the League of Nations, as evidenced by its own actions. China only supports the League of Nations when it sees an opportunity to use the League of Nations to achieve its goals. Japan faithfully supports the League of Nations, and hopes to remain a faithful supporter of the League of Nations as long as it feels that its support for the League of Nations does not absolutely conflict with its national survival and its policy of maintaining peace in the Far East. Matsuoka ended by saying that he reserved the right to submit a written opinion later.</p>
<p>Then, Chairman Valera declared that he felt that it would be useless to continue the meeting tonight. He hoped that the discussion of the Lytton Report could proceed tomorrow, but he would not deny either side an appropriate opportunity to present their views. (Reuters telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) At today's (23rd) Executive Council meeting, after the Chinese and Japanese representatives debated, Chairman Valera immediately invited Sir Lytton to join the Executive Council's table, and at the same time asked whether the members of the Investigation Team, after hearing the remarks made by the Chinese and Japanese representatives in a moment, believed that the Investigation Team's report needed to be revised, and asked the members of the Investigation Team to quickly convene a meeting to discuss and report to the General Assembly in the shortest possible time. The Japanese representative repeatedly stood up, saying that the League of Nations Investigation Team no longer existed, so the team no longer had the qualifications to express its opinions. Valera replied that the League of Nations Investigation Team still existed in fact, and of course had the right to express its opinions before it was dissolved. Matsuoka expressed his opposition to this, saying that he could not accept this method. The Chairman replied that this method was customary, etc. The Chinese representative Gu Weijun expressed his support for inviting the Investigation Team to express its opinions, saying that it was proper to give the Investigation Team an opportunity to express its opinions, but he argued that the Investigation Team's meeting should wait until he had fully replied to the points made by the Japanese representative. At this point, Valera indicated that he accepted this, but the Japanese representative Matsuoka still expressed his opposition, but said that if the Japanese interpretation was indeed wrong, then the Japanese representative was willing to withdraw his opposition, but he personally still believed that the Japanese interpretation was not wrong.</p>
<p>Valera said that the General Assembly did not have any suggestions for the Investigation Team to revise its report, but the Investigation Team members could revise it if they wanted to. Sir Lytton then stood up and said that since the members of the Investigation Team left China and returned to their respective countries, the Investigation Team had not held a single meeting. As far as he knew, the General Assembly's request for the members of the Investigation Team to convene a meeting was not to discuss the opinions of the Chinese and Japanese representatives, but to instruct the Investigation Team members to study the opinions expressed by the Chinese and Japanese representatives to see if it could allow them to revise the report they had drafted, and then report to the Executive Council. Therefore, he had decided to convene a meeting tomorrow to discuss this issue. Only then did it become clear that Lytton and the other Investigation Team members had been invited by Valera to attend the Executive Council meeting, but they were not seated at the meeting table. Valera then said that, with Japan's reservation, the Executive Council expressed its disapproval of this proposal and hoped that the Investigation Team could submit its report to the Executive Council in the shortest possible time. The Japanese representative Matsuoka then raised his opposition, firmly insisting that the Executive Council register the Japanese opposition.</p>
<p>The Executive Council then discussed the next item on the agenda in order, which was the issue of the currency system of Danzig.</p>
<p>The general trend seemed to be that the Executive Council would hold at least two more meetings to decide on further measures, but everyone hoped that the Executive Council's discussion of the East Province issue could be concluded within this week. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Transfer to the General Assembly for Discussion Can Definitely Be Realized</p>
<p>Denying That "Manchukuo" is a Satisfactory Solution</p>
<p>The People of the Country Should Prepare to Use Their Own Strength</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations Executive Council meeting has already opened. This reporter visited a certain important person in diplomatic circles on the 24th to inquire about the trend of the League of Nations meeting. According to the conversation, the League of Nations' handling of procedural issues has encountered opposition from the Japanese representative, and it seems to be difficult, but procedural issues are not the fundamental issue of the Sino-Japanese dispute, so it is not difficult to resolve. The Japanese representative's opposition to transferring the issue to the Committee of Nineteen and the League of Nations General Assembly is simply unreasonable and lacks sufficient justification, so transferring the discussion can definitely be realized. After the League of Nations General Assembly convenes in the future, it will definitely formally declare that it does not recognize "Manchukuo." However, declaring that it does not recognize "Manchukuo" is not a satisfactory solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute, so we cannot be optimistic about the situation in the League of Nations, but we cannot be pessimistic either. Originally, our lodging of the Sino-Japanese dispute with the League of Nations was only because the League of Nations is an organization for seeking world peace, hoping to obtain a peaceful and fair solution, not relying on the League of Nations. If the League of Nations cannot guarantee world justice and peace, then we should also use our own strength to protect our own territorial sovereignty. At this time of tense and illusory changes in the international situation, the people of the country should always be prepared to exert their own strength. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>Japan's Opposition is All in Vain</p>

<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has realized that the Committee of Nineteen and the General Assembly are powerless to prevent the meeting from convening. Although it has threatened various countries with withdrawing from the League of Nations, various countries have become accustomed to this kind of intimidation and ignored it. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered Representative Matsuoka by telegram not to withdraw from Geneva because of the Committee of Nineteen, putting Japanese diplomacy in a stalemate, but still participate in the meeting and uphold Japan's position. (Reuters telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This reporter met with the diplomatic authorities on the 24th and talked about the situation of the League of Nations meeting. They praised Representative Gu's calm and unhurried attitude, witty and solemn words, and his thorough refutation of Matsuoka. This reporter asked when the Executive Council could transfer the Lytton Report to the Special Assembly for discussion. They said that although the League of Nations now wants to obtain unanimous agreement on this matter, it will be ineffective if the Japanese side insists on opposing the law. We may be able to hear Representative Yan in early next month, using his experienced and capable tone to thoroughly rebuke Matsuoka. This reporter noted that when the League of Nations Special Assembly convenes, our side will be represented by Yan, Gu, and Guo, with Yan speaking in the capacity of chief representative. Although it must be discussed by the Committee of Nineteen before the Executive Council transfers it to the Special Assembly, diplomats predict that the meeting of the Committee of Nineteen will be extremely short.

<p>Japan's Plan to Ally with Russia Fails</p>
<p>Russia Will Show Its Hand When Necessary</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When Matsuoka went to Europe via Russia, he attempted to use the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty as bait to elevate himself by taking advantage of the Soviet Union. According to reliable information from diplomatic circles, the Soviet Union has completely seen through Matsuoka's cunning plan and has become even more indifferent to Japan, completely ignoring it. Matsuoka's plan has completely failed. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet newspapers are not commenting on the discussion of the Manchurian issue in Geneva. Official spokespersons are also maintaining strict silence. Moscow is now quietly observing the situation, and will show its hand when there are important developments in the Geneva competition. However, the Soviet Union feels that the current situation in the three northeastern provinces is unlikely to change dramatically, and the Soviet Union has often been able to deal with it with relative calm in the past.

<h3 id="e16">Japan's Economic Situation Does Not Allow It to Withdraw from the League of Nations <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Young Radicals are Still Emptyly Singing High-Pitched Tunes</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to general observations, the current economic situation in Japan is extremely depressed. If it is forced to withdraw from the League of Nations, as the end of the year approaches, bankrupt merchants will inevitably follow one after another, and the chaos in Japan's economic circles will be unimaginable. (China United Press telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations Council has become likely to run aground due to the machinations of a group of anti-Japanese elements. The young radicals within the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs say that the reason why the League of Nations does not frankly accept Japan's hope to recognize "Manchukuo" is because Japan has no determination to withdraw from the League of Nations. They predict that if the General Assembly puts pressure on it, Japan will comply. Therefore, Japan should abandon its wait-and-see policy at this time and, in accordance with the wishes of the people, implement its withdrawal from the League of Nations to show Japan's determination. Proponents of this view within the ministry are gradually gaining strength, and their trend is extremely noteworthy. However, this withdrawal theory is not a purely emotional argument. It is based on the following two viewpoints, purely rational and political: 1. The current League of Nations is based on the spirit of Wilson and the balance of power thinking of Clemenceau. Now that the United States and Russia have not participated, it is in fact only a European alliance. Moreover, as evidenced by the words and actions of the League of Nations since last fall, it has completely exposed that the League of Nations has no qualifications to speak on the Far East issue. 2. Japan has its own traditional national policy regarding the Manchurian issue, which does not allow other countries to interfere. It is true that since last fall, it has been troubled by the League of Nations' empty discussions due to being confused by the words "five major powers," "three major powers," or "first-class countries," resulting in unnecessary contact with the League of Nations. 3. The situation regarding the independence of "Manchukuo" has completely changed from last fall. Japan has long had a basis for requesting the League of Nations to withdraw the Manchurian issue. However, if the League of Nations is allowed to review the issue again and submit to its pressure tactics, then Japan's Manchurian policy will often be subject to the League of Nations' restrictions in the future. Now the beginning has already been opened. Therefore, Japan should resolutely withdraw from the League of Nations at this time to show its determination to move forward courageously for peace in the Far East.

<p>Stating that if the League of Nations Cannot Rectify the Current Situation</p>
<p>A Second World War May Ultimately Be Inevitable</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, a pamphlet written by Miller, an advisor to the Chinese government, was published here. It describes the current state of military preparedness and the new system of alliances as being similar to the situation before the European War. If the League of Nations cannot resolve the Manchurian problem and the Far East becomes a pivotal point, the consequences would be dire. Miller stated that if the Washington Conference is deemed worthless and can be disregarded by Japan at will, then treaties made with the United States, or any treaties made by any country with Japan, will be unreliable. If the League of Nations cannot rectify the current situation, the Washington Treaty, along with many matters contained within it, will fall to the ground. If the treaty is torn up due to a lack of support from Britain and France, then America's trust in Britain and France will weaken. If the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Treaty cannot stop Japan's aggression, then China and Japan, the two countries most concerned with curbing this aggression, may be forced to unite to defend themselves if threatened by other hostile blocs of powers. This is essentially a return to the pre-European War state of affairs. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>Qiqihar: Sergeant Iwakami, the only survivor of the Kawase unit of fifty-nine men, which was annihilated by the Volunteer Army near Tai'an earlier this month, is currently in the Cavalry Dormitory of the Southern Camp. He told reporters about the disaster of the Kawase unit, saying that the Kawase unit strayed into a swamp in Dongxintun, west of Tai'an, at 7:00 AM on October 20th. When the entire unit dismounted and walked, they were suddenly surrounded by the Volunteer Army. The entire unit fought back. Soon, Lieutenant Kataoka, Sergeant-Major Shiraishi, and I were appointed as messengers, ordered to report to the troops inside Tai'an city for help. We left the unit at 7:50 AM. At that time, only one person had died in battle. At 8:00 AM, we broke through the hail of bullets, ran along the river, and at around 2:00 PM, we were shot at again by thirty members of the Volunteer Army on a small mountain. Lieutenant Kataoka was shot in the foot and fell to the ground. Sergeant-Major Shiraishi and I picked up Kataoka, but Kataoka shouted loudly, saying that the unit was in danger and that we had a responsibility to report, ordering us to leave him and go. We parted with tears and continued to advance. At about 3:00 PM, we arrived at the Lao Wangjia village. The residents discovered us and shouted loudly. Before long, seventy or eighty residents in plainclothes attacked with pistols and sticks. Sergeant-Major Shiraishi was hit in the shoulder and died in battle. I retreated alone to the riverbank, wandering on the swampy ice, spying on the movements of the villagers, spending the night. By dawn on the 30th, my body had lost consciousness, but I took advantage of the opportunity to run towards Tai'an. On the way, I encountered the Volunteer Army twice. When I was thirty meters away from Tai'an, I was shot at again by the Volunteer Army, but I survived the ordeal and reached the Tai'an Japanese military camp. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie previously went to Shanghai, also to visit the Central Committee members in Shanghai regarding the League of Nations matter, and has now returned to Nanjing.

<p>Yi Peiji Has Not Received Orders</p>
<p>Jiang Han Believes They Cannot Be Moved</p>
<p>(Beiping) A reporter visited Yi Peiji and asked about the matter of moving the National Palace Museum's antiquities to Luoyang. He said that he had only seen it in the newspapers and had not officially received orders, so he did not want to express any opinion. According to Jiang Han, the Chairman of the National Palace Museum, the antiquities cannot be moved for the following reasons: 1) Luoyang has many mountains, inconvenient transportation, and bandits appear frequently, making storage very difficult; 2) After the relocation, the citizens will see the situation and think that a major disaster is coming, causing panic and affecting public security. Zhou Lisheng and Gao Lu have completed their investigation of the National Palace Museum and will leave Beiping within the day. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e30">How to Assist the Hardships of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>Today's newspaper published Mr. Li Fusun's article "The Current Situation of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and the Efforts We Should Make." It contains a general description of the relationship between overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and China's domestic economy, and their current difficult situation. The most striking point is the call for the domestic economic community to provide substantial assistance to the financial undertakings of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia in order to revive the economic strength of overseas Chinese. Mr. Li is a leader in the financial community, and he has also personally gone to Southeast Asia for on-the-spot investigations. His arguments are naturally alarming and practical. However, what Mr. Li said is only one aspect of the overall plan to rescue overseas Chinese. We would like to further elaborate on what we have seen.</p>
<p>Wherever the sea waves reach, there are traces of overseas Chinese. This saying is almost universally recognized in the world. And the dynamism of these overseas Chinese is indeed, as Mr. Li said in his article, "building the foundation of industry and commerce with bare hands." Their contribution to the motherland is not only, as Mr. Li said, "relying on remittances from overseas Chinese to inject large amounts of money to make up for the excess of imports in trade over the years," and the donations from overseas Chinese are also numerous in times of floods, droughts, and famines. The enthusiasm to volunteer during the January 28th Incident can also be seen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution." From this, we can imagine the greatness of the contribution of overseas Chinese to the revolution of the motherland.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the undertakings of overseas Chinese have obviously been declining day by day. As a result, their contribution to the motherland is still extremely enthusiastic, but they have gradually felt unable to support it. According to the annual business report of the Bank of China last year, "Since the world market has declined and commerce in Southeast Asia has declined, there have been many job losses. Therefore, the British and Dutch governments have tried to limit the entry of overseas Chinese... As a result, fewer and fewer overseas Chinese are migrating to Southeast Asia, and more and more are returning to China. Last year, the amount of money remitted by overseas Chinese, although not an accurate figure, was approximately no more than 200 million yuan, which is at least 50 million yuan less than in 1919." Not only that, but the extremely unreasonable treatment suffered by overseas Chinese everywhere due to the weakness of the motherland's political protection is even more heartbreaking. If we believe that the activities of overseas Chinese occupy an extremely important position in our country's national economy, then the blows suffered by overseas Chinese everywhere at present are tantamount to a major trauma suffered by our country's national economy. And the increasingly difficult life of overseas Chinese is no less than a terrible shadow on the future of our nation.</p>
<p>However, the reason why overseas Chinese have suffered blows is certainly not accidental. The surging and unyielding world economic panic has made capitalist countries feel the tightening of the market and the increasing difficulty of the unemployment problem. The impact of this is bound to limit the entry of foreigners, restrict the activities of foreigners, and even impose various unreasonable oppressions and humiliations to make it impossible for them to live in peace. Therefore, the problem of the economic hardship of overseas Chinese, viewed from its positive side, seems to be caused only by the weakness of our country's political protection, but in reality, it is closely related to the world's economic panic.</p>
<p>Today, we cannot make politics sound and increase the political protection of overseas Chinese for a while, nor can we expect the turning point of the world's economic panic to make the life of overseas Chinese stable. Therefore, what we can say today about rescuing overseas Chinese is nothing more than doing our best to do it.</p>
<p>The assistance to the financial undertakings of overseas Chinese mentioned in Mr. Li's article is one of the things we can do. In addition, we would like to put forward two more points.</p>
<p>First, promote overseas Chinese education. Education is not only deeply related to the knowledge of overseas Chinese, but also deeply related to their careers. Because individual struggles and less united activities are enough to make the activities of overseas Chinese fail, the only way is to promote their education and increase their unity. This is one.</p>
<p>Second, give overseas Chinese a stable opportunity to invest in the country. Overseas activities have already encountered difficulties, so why not return and invest in the country to support domestic industry and commerce? However, the current domestic politics in our country is not sound, which is also the biggest concern for overseas Chinese investment. Therefore, our government should work hard to stabilize social order and eliminate various restrictions on the progress of industry and commerce, giving overseas Chinese a stable investment opportunity. This is the second.</p>
<p>The above two are also things that can be done with strength. Proceed practically on what we can do, and promote its realization. Although it is a minor path, overseas Chinese may not be able to get rid of their difficulties and restore their prosperity because of this. But shouldn't we do this if we want to do our best to help overseas Chinese?</p>

<h3 id="e31">Japanese Foreign Ministry Plans to Request Russian Side Again to Allow Japanese Negotiators to Stay in Russian Territory Temporarily <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Believe Russian Side Favors Su Bingwen</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan requested the Japanese Foreign Ministry to withdraw the Japanese negotiator Komatsubara and his party from Russian territory. The Foreign Ministry replied to the Russian side that negotiations between the Japanese army and Su Bingwen were not hopeless and that there would be ample room for negotiations. Please allow the Japanese negotiators to postpone leaving Russian territory temporarily. (Japan United Press, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Russian authorities' request for the Japanese committee to rescue the Japanese captives of General Su Bingwen to leave the Russian territory of Mazufugaya has caused a bad impression here. Today, according to a government spokesman, the Japanese envoy in Moscow telegraphed the Foreign Ministry, saying that Soviet Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan informed the Japanese Embassy that he knew from the beginning that General Su Bingwen would never agree to negotiate with Japan. The Japanese people regard Karakhan's admission as very important. They believe that the uprising of General Su Bingwen was powerfully backed by Soviet Russia, which can be clearly seen from this. The spokesman also said that northwest of the Hinggan Mountains is proof that Soviet Russia is exercising superior power. If Soviet Russia is sincere, it can persuade General Su Bingwen to negotiate with Japan. Now that Soviet Russia does not use its power, it obviously has other intentions. Soviet Russia may want to use the situation to coerce Japan into negotiating a non-aggression treaty. If so, Soviet Russia is pursuing a misguided policy, and its attitude contradicts its past friendship with Japan. The Army Ministry has now decided to apply to the Soviet Russian government through the Foreign Ministry to allow the Japanese committee to stay in Mazufugaya to persuade General Su Bingwen to start negotiations with Japan.

<p>No Important Discussions with Chiang During This Meeting in Hankou</p>
<p>No Proposals for the Third Plenary Session, Attendance Undecided</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang received the press this afternoon at the Shuncheng Wangfu. He said that there were three reasons for his trip south: 1. To report to Chiang on the political situation in North China since the reorganization of the Military Affairs Commission; 2. Chiang originally intended to come north to inspect, but due to the importance of his duties, he hurried to visit him; 3. To meet with Song Ziwen to discuss and seek his opinion on the financial reorganization of North China. He met with Chiang twice in Hankou, but there were no important discussions. He met with Song once, but Song urgently returned to Shanghai due to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company case and arranged to talk again in Hangzhou. Regarding the financial problems in North China, he took advantage of his first trip to Hangzhou to tour and visit the aviation school. After Song returned to Beijing, he returned to Hankou to bid farewell to Chiang and came north. He is a Supervisory Committee member for the Third Plenary Session and has no heavy responsibilities. His attendance is undecided, and he has no proposals. The matter of moving the Palace Museum artifacts to Luoyang is only a matter of press reports, and he does not know the details. He believes that there are quite a few unjust accusations against Feng in the outside world, but Feng is good at speaking and has not forgotten his feelings for the country, so it is easy to attract rumors. Bandit suppression in the three provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui has largely cleared the north of the Yangtze River. Only Xu's remaining 10,000-plus troops and He's 3,000 troops remain, which can be easily resolved. According to Zhang Fang, in their party area, people are killed like flies, extremely cruel and harsh, especially the death of Yue Weijun, which was tragic. Heads of people are hung everywhere in the communist area, and there are even more heads of children, to encourage cruelty with cruelty and to kill each other. Female bandits are everywhere, specializing in killing intellectuals. Within the communist area, there are everything from arsenals and military and political schools to hospitals and factories. There have been no telegrams from Su Bingwen and Ma Zhanshan in the last two days. The border situation in Rehe is extremely complex, and there are no special announcements that can be made recently.

<p>National News Agency Dispatch from Danzig, 24th: Trotsky, accompanied by his wife and secretary, arrived here by car last night. They disembarked from the train ten miles away and switched to a car to avoid attention. As soon as Trotsky set foot on Danzig territory, he was greeted with vehement protests. The police's efforts to stop them were ineffective. About fifty communists gathered near the docks. Upon seeing Trotsky, they shouted "Traitor!" incessantly. Trotsky was escorted off the ship by twelve Danzig police officers and walked to a nearby station, where a specially prepared train took him to Danzig. Trotsky is scheduled to give a speech at the sports club on Saturday. Tickets have been sold out for days. If the authorities raise no objections, he will give another speech next week.</p>
<p>National News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 24th: A local Berlin newspaper carries an unconfirmed Moscow report that the Soviet Russian government has informed the Danish government that if Trotsky is allowed to reside in or permanently reside in Denmark, the Soviet Russian government will not consider it a friendly act.</p>

<p>▲ The name of a place in Northern Siberia is Igarka</p>
<p>▲ Once uninhabited, it is now a small city of over ten thousand people</p>
<p>TASS Dispatch from Moscow: The industrial and cultural influence of the Soviet Union has penetrated its northernmost borders. Areas where explorers once never set foot are now being developed and constructed. In Northern Siberia, near 67.5 degrees north latitude, there is a place called Igarka. Within the Arctic Circle, small steamers can reach it in fourteen to fifteen days during the summer when the rivers thaw. In winter, it takes two to three months by fire and dog sled to reach the area. Most strangely, the area experiences three months of the year when the sun sets and does not rise, and another three months when the sun shines continuously and does not set. During the three months of winter without sunshine, it is perpetually dark, and the temperature drops to minus 60 degrees Celsius. However, even summer is not warm, and the ground is frozen solid two feet below the surface. The area has unlimited natural resources, especially graphite, coal, and non-metallic minerals. Three years ago, the area was uninhabited. Now, after development, it has become a small city of 12,000 people, with several factories and schools. Its population includes more than thirty different ethnic groups. Newly established schools are determined to eliminate adult illiteracy first, and the cultural situation is showing signs of progress.</p>
<p>Hitler Replies to Hindenburg, Rejecting Conditions for Forming a Cabinet</p>
<h3 id="e84">Demands the President Grant Him Dictatorial Powers <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from Berlin, 23rd: Nazi Party leader Hitler today replied to President Hindenburg, rejecting the conditions for accepting the position of Chancellor. Hitler stated that because of these conditions, he could not form a government supported by a majority of the Reichstag. Hitler also suggested forming a presidential cabinet, with himself or another Nazi Party member as Chancellor, and granting him dictatorial powers so that he could dissolve the Reichstag and abolish the constitution when it became unruly. Hitler asked the President to accept his plan, because the motherland is in a state of despair, and only this can resolve the political crisis in the shortest possible time. The Nazi Party is still trying to win the support of the German National People's Party and the Stahlhelm.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from Berlin, 24th: It is reported that President Hindenburg has rejected Hitler's proposal to form a presidential cabinet led by himself.</p>
<p>National News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 23rd: Hitler's reply to Hindenburg today, which is eight pages long, has declined to form a government supported by the Reichstag and stated that he is still willing to be at the President's disposal. The President is currently studying Hitler's reply. Political circles now believe that Hitler will not be able to form a government for the time being, and the President will ask other leaders to form a new government.</p>

<p>Debtor Nations Can Repay Debts in Their Own Currency</p>
<p>Another Committee to Be Formed to Discuss the Entire Issue</p>
<h3 id="e86">Stimson Responds to Britain and France Based on This Principle <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency Dispatch from Washington, 23rd: After meeting with members of Congress today, US President Hoover issued a statement on the war debt issue, giving Europe a glimmer of hope for revising the war debts. However, the revision depends on the issue of arms reduction and the World Economic Conference. If the goal is to effectively relieve the finances of debtor nations, it will be very limited, and there is no suggestion of extending the moratorium period for debts due in December, indicating a continued unwillingness to concede. However, the proposal that debtor nations may repay debts in their own currency, rather than US dollars, may slightly alleviate their suffering.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from Washington, 24th: Secretary of State Stimson today replied to the notes from France and Britain regarding the war debt issue.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from New York, 23rd: President Hoover's decision on war debts has caused the pound to fall to a new low for the year, at $3.24 and 7/8.</p>
<h3 id="e87">War Debts Are Related to Arms Reduction <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency Dispatch from Washington, 23rd: President Hoover's statement is several thousand words long. Its main recommendation is that Congress should form a war debt committee to discuss the entire war debt issue with the debtor nations. The committee members should be the US representatives to the World Disarmament Conference and the World Economic Conference. In addition, before describing this proposal, he declared that the current debt agreements must be maintained (in other words, the payments due this term must be paid as scheduled).</p>
<p>As for the request from Britain, France, and other countries to extend the moratorium period or revise the agreement, President Hoover explained his position, saying that Britain, France, and other countries have not presented sufficient facts to prove that the debts due in December should be postponed. They only proposed suspending the payments due in December and that the two governments engage in discussions on the war debt issue, but lacked evidence of an inability to pay. In my view, this proposal is not very strong. I believe that the American people should not be asked to make further sacrifices. I must reiterate that in the minds of Americans, the war debt issue is closely related to the arms reduction issue and the heavy burden placed on Americans and other people by the competition in armaments. Therefore, we must develop an important avenue for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>After President Hoover's statement was released, French Ambassador Claudel went to the State Department to obtain a copy and made no comment. It is expected that representatives of the debtor nations will each receive a copy within a few hours. In addition, President-elect Roosevelt was also sent a copy by the government before departing for Warm Springs for rest and recuperation. Democratic leaders returned to the Mayflower Hotel after Hoover's declaration and consulted with Roosevelt on the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Nature of the War Debt Committee <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>According to President Hoover's proposal, the formation of a war debt committee is, in effect, a re-establishment of the War Debt Funding Commission, granting it full authority to negotiate with the debtor nations and then report the results of the negotiations and its recommendations to Congress. The suggestion that committee members should be disarmament representatives and economic conference representatives can be seen as an indication that the US government will not agree to revise the war debts until Europe reduces its armaments. The suggestion that economic issues should also be included in the discussion is, in effect, only for the sake of saving time.</p>
<p>As for the reason for President Hoover's proposal, the meeting between Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt yesterday did not yield results, and today's consultation with members of Congress did not reach an agreement. Hoover, with his term coming to an end, did not want to shoulder the difficult task of resolving the war debt issue again, so he informally handed the entire issue over to Congress. It is expected that when Congress convenes in the future, the President will formally propose this in his report on the state of the union. As for President Hoover's previous expression of support for extending the moratorium period and his sudden change of attitude this time, it is because members of Congress largely opposed extending the moratorium period.</p>
<p>The situation during today's meeting between the President and members of Congress can be described as not very fruitful. Afterwards, Republican Senator Watson told people, "None of us agreed." Democratic leader Rayburn stated, "We agreed with the President on two points: that war debts should not be reduced or canceled again, and that the payments due in December should be paid as scheduled." Senator Harrison stated that members of Congress had little enthusiasm for the war debt committee proposal.</p>
<p>After today's meeting between the President and members of Congress, financier Bernard Baruch went to invite Roosevelt to meet with President Hoover again, but Roosevelt politely declined. Afterwards, Roosevelt met with Democratic members of Congress at the Mayflower Hotel and then left for Warm Springs for rest and recuperation. The details of the Democratic leaders' meeting have not been released.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Roosevelt Expresses His Opinion <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Later, Roosevelt expressed his opinion on the train, saying that the war debt issue between the United States and European countries can be negotiated by existing diplomatic agencies and does not need to be handled by Congress or a separate committee. He also said that he and President Hoover had many points of agreement on the war debt issue, but that he firmly insisted during his meeting with the President that the request from Britain, France, and other countries to suspend the payments due in December was a matter for the current government. He also said that the two completely agreed that the actual amount borrowed must be repaid, and that debtor nations must negotiate separately with the United States, not hold a general meeting where debtor nations and creditor nations stand on opposite sides, because he and President Hoover both believe that such negotiations should be handled separately based on each country's economic situation and ability to pay. Also, the war debt issue must be completely separated from the German reparations issue. The United States will only begin negotiations with the debtor nations after this is clearly stated.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Britain and France Experience Painful Reactions <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency Dispatch from London, 24th: After the news that the US government firmly refused to make concessions on war debts reached here, it immediately made a deep impression on the British government and public. Because the news arrived too late last night, the cabinet did not meet, but it was reported that the Chancellor of the Exchequer immediately prepared a new draft note, which will be submitted to the cabinet for discussion today and sent to Washington. News from New York reported that Morgan is willing to lend Britain £20 million to maintain the pound, with an equal amount of gold stored in London as collateral, but British financial circles are not very enthusiastic about this. If Morgan's loan proposal is indeed in the aforementioned manner, it is feared that it may not be accepted by Britain.</p>
<p>National News Agency Dispatch from London, 24th: Since the US rejected Britain's proposal to suspend war debt payments, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar opened this morning, immediately falling from 3.273125 at yesterday's close to 3.2425, and the price of gold immediately rose to 126 shillings and 10 pence per ounce, an increase of 11.5 pence from yesterday, exactly equal to the unprecedented high price of December 8th last year.</p>
<p>National News Agency Dispatch from Paris, 24th: After the news that the US government decided not to suspend the war debts due on December 15th reached here, it immediately caused painful impressions among the French. However, newspapers are still trying to downplay the importance of the matter, apparently fearing that it will have a major impact on France's financial position and the position of the Herriot cabinet. France owes the United States war debts totaling 6,850,000,000 gold dollars under the 1926 agreement, to be repaid in 62 years, including a principal of 3,865,000,000 gold dollars. The principal and interest payable in this fiscal year are 60,000,000 gold dollars. The interest payable on December 15th of this year is 19,261,432.50 gold dollars, and the interest payable on June 15th of next year is 19,261,432.50 gold dollars and the principal is 21,477,135 gold dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Lausanne Conference to Be Reconvened <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency Dispatch from Paris, 23rd: Former Finance Minister Flandin has returned after consulting with the British government on the war debt issue in London. According to his statement to the press, if the United States refuses the application of various countries to revise the method of repaying political war debts, then Europe must reconvene the reparations conference and revise the Lausanne Agreement. If the United States refuses to extend the moratorium period for war debts, then the entire issue will have to be reconsidered, because the Lausanne Agreement clearly stipulates that the United States intends to allow the revision of the existing debt repayment agreement.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from London, 24th: British newspapers commented that if the United States insists on paying the debts when due, then no matter how other debtor nations cope, Britain must grit its teeth and repay the debts quickly. However, the difficulties ahead are also generally recognized. The debts due on December 15th amount to £28 million for the UK, and an additional budget will be necessary, equivalent to an increase of 5 pence per pound on income tax. At the same time, France may demand the lifting of the Lausanne Agreement, as French Finance Minister Flandin said in a speech in Paris that there may be a need to reconvene the Lausanne Conference. The Daily Mail reported that if the situation is not handled properly, it will become a long-term source of trouble between Europe and the United States. The Times stated that if Britain does not fulfill its debt obligations, all debtor nations in the world will follow suit, and even private debtors will have an excuse, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Several newspapers advocated that Britain repay the debts in gold, as the only way to avoid major disruptions in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from London, 23rd: Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said at a dinner party today that some people believe that the British government's previous note to the United States regarding the war debts owed to the United States in December and the uncertain outcome of this note is one of the reasons for the weakness of the pound exchange rate. It should be known that there is no reason to be anxious now. Britain's request for a temporary suspension of payments while the British and American governments discuss this matter is not an unreasonable proposal. The suspension of reparations agreed upon at Lausanne has immediately had a stabilizing effect on European public opinion. A temporary suspension of exchange rate fluctuations is now necessary for the whole world, and the trust created by the Lausanne solution should not be disrupted at the beginning of discussions. He believes that discussions are actually beneficial to both sides. Britain has already repaid £130 million in short-term debts. Britain's trade balance has increased by £86 million compared to the beginning of this year, and the position of the British Empire is also gradually improving, which shows that the temporary fall in the value of the pound need not be a cause for concern.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from London, 23rd: The British side, in debt to the United States, considers President Hoover's war debt declaration to be satisfactory. President Hoover considers Britain's request not to be unreasonable, but says that the debtor nations have not yet explained the facts that payments should be temporarily suspended. It is generally believed that the US President's remarks are quite pertinent, so it is expected that Britain will send another letter to the United States detailing these facts and reasons. The British believe that there are many such facts and that they are very powerful, because if the debts are paid as scheduled, the exchange rate will fluctuate, the economy will be disrupted, capital will flow out, and general trust will be lost.</p>

<p>Reuters Dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: After Korean Governor-General Ugaki and Prime Minister Saitō reached an understanding on the Korean budget plan for next year, Ugaki departed for Seoul this afternoon.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: Governor-General of Korea Ugaki returned to his post on today's express train. In his conversation on the train, he stated the following: "I originally planned to stay in Tokyo in the middle of this month, but I have now changed my schedule to return to my post. It is not that there is any particularly urgent matter in Korea. My tasks in Tokyo have been largely completed. The purpose of coming to Tokyo has been achieved. Although there are various rumors in political circles, I still hope that the current cabinet will continue for the time being. The Korean budget for next year has largely been finalized. Also, regarding the Korean rice issue, I have consulted with Prime Minister Saitō and Colonial Affairs Minister Nagai, who have agreed not to treat it as foreign rice. The border security issue has also been discussed in various ways, and as a result, it is planned to increase the number of police officers by ○○, which is expected to require a budget of about one million yen."</p>

<p>=The Jichang and Jihai Railways Have Been Repeatedly Destroyed, Making Train Traffic Impossible=</p>
<p>=Attacking Changchun, the Puppet Capital, Causing Panic and Inflicting Heavy Losses on Japanese Troops=</p>
<p>丨The Volunteer Army is Devoting Efforts to Recruitment and Liaison丨</p>
<p>丨Therefore, Unity is Growing Stronger and Momentum is Increasing丨</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Tianjin: Chuan Dianchen, Commander of the Independent Seventh Detachment of the Northeastern National Salvation Army, is leading the First, Second, and Third Divisions to operate in the Jichang and Jihai Railway areas. The number of times the traffic on these two railways has been disrupted is unknown. Commander Chuan is extremely familiar with the terrain. His attacks are like sudden storms, and his retreats are as elusive as sunken fish or lost geese, causing the Japanese and puppet armies to exhaust themselves chasing him. The following is an excerpt from the reports of Gao Yunzhang, Political Special Commissioner, and Wang Mengpin, Military Special Commissioner, of the detachment: 1. On September 18, our army occupied the Jihai Railway and inflicted heavy losses on the puppet army, causing significant damage to bridges and rails. To this day, the entire line remains closed to traffic. Liu Jingchun, Commander of our First Division, and Sun Tiemin, Deputy Commander, returned to the headquarters in Koukou Mountain on the Jihai Railway on the morning of October 2. The division's defense area covers approximately 240 li around the Fourth District of Panshi County, including Maling Station, Hulanji, Changzhen, Heixionggou, Heishizhen, Liujiadian, and Shaoguojie in the Third District. Lin Guiyi, Commander of the Second Division, returned to the Koukou River headquarters on the Jihai Railway on the afternoon of the 2nd. The division's defense area covers approximately 185 li around the Sixth District of Yongji County, including Shuanghezhen, Dongzhan, Xinglongjie, Badaogou, Xinglongchuan, Huashuhezi, Weitanggou, and Dahechuan, Nanxiangshihezi, Huangqibao, Jinjiatun, Yilaxi in the Fifth District. Li Ziyang, Commander of the Third Division, led his troops in battles against the Japanese and puppet armies in the Songjiagou and Yaojiagou areas along the Jichang Railway, without a fixed defense area at the moment. Around 5 PM on the evening of the 2nd, Zhao Furui, Brigade Commander of the 25th Brigade of Feng Zhanhai's army, led his troops and 6,712 recruited bandits to Koukou River in Yongji County, requesting to be reorganized into the National Salvation Army and to be under the command and dispatch of Chief Supervisor Zhu Jiqing. This unit had strong men, well-fed horses, and well-equipped weapons and ammunition, including four heavy machine guns, two light machine guns, and 21 boxes of ammunition. (Note: Brigade Commander Zhao's unit was made up of those who defected from the garrison troops at Zhangjiawan, Xiaohaozi, and Mihezi stations along the Hachang Railway.) It was agreed to introduce this unit as the Independent Eighth Detachment of the Northeastern National Salvation Army. On the 4th, the unit marched in formation to Xinanbao and recruited 1,410 members of the local self-defense force, further strengthening its strength. 2. On the 6th, the headquarters of the Seventh Detachment advanced to Koukoukou in the Third District of Panshi County (on the Jihai Railway) and established contact with Song Guorong's army of the Eighth Route of the Fourth Military Region in Liaodong (Song was a defector from the garrison troops in Panshi County). Because Song's army had already recovered Shuangyang County (100 li south of Panshi County), that day, Brigade Commander Xie Zhensheng of the Fourth Military Region in Liaodong came to present six rockets for shooting down Japanese aircraft. On the morning of that day, Ma Junshan, Chief of Staff of our Eighth Detachment, came to Chalukou to report on the recruitment of the Xinanbao Self-Defense Force in the Fourth District of Shuangyang County and requested that our Military Special Commissioner Wang Mengpin go to inspect and reorganize them. However, Wang had already advanced with the headquarters of the Seventh Detachment, so Political Special Commissioner Gao Yunzhang accompanied Chief of Staff Ma to Xinanbao to inspect the First and Second Divisions and the machine gun company. On the evening of the 7th, the Eighth Detachment ordered an advance. On the 8th, Wang Hailou, Commander of the First Division of the detachment, led his troops to Zhujiadatun, 20 li south of Changchun. Zhu Pengjiu, Commander of the Second Division, led the machine gun company to Matoutai, 25 li from Changchun. On the evening of the 9th, they attacked Changchun, causing panic in the puppet capital. The Japanese and puppet armies defended with all their might. In order to preserve their strength, our army changed its target and attacked the Gongzhuling Station and Fanjiatun Station on the South Manchuria Railway. On the evening of the 10th, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese and puppet armies, killing over 100 enemies and injuring many more. At dawn on the 11th, enemy reinforcements arrived and attacked our rear with armored trains. The Eighth Detachment was surrounded and fought fiercely until noon before breaking through a bloody path. Both sides suffered considerable casualties. 3. Temporary maintenance committees were established in the areas recovered by the Seventh and Eighth Detachments to: 1. Maintain local order; 2. Provide military rations. The security responsibilities were assumed by the garrison troops in each area. As for the offices of the political and military special commissioners, they were temporarily not established due to economic reasons and were located within the headquarters. 4. On the 11th, over 1,000 Japanese soldiers departed from Jilin on track-mounted armored vehicles to Shuanghezhen to protect the repair of the railway that had been destroyed by the Seventh Detachment. Our Second Division immediately engaged them. After a stalemate of half a day, our Second Division retreated to Qiaomailing due to strategic considerations. The Japanese army then intensified the repair work and extended it to Heixionggou that night. A trainload of soldiers also arrived from Jilin. Our First and Second Divisions jointly ambushed them. After fierce battles for two days and three nights, the enemy's corpses piled up like pillows. At dawn on the 14th, due to the depletion of ammunition, we ordered a retreat to Sanjiazi, 20 li from Yantongshan. The headquarters returned to Koukou River. In this battle, over 100 enemies were killed, and the number of wounded is unknown. We captured one light machine gun and 61 rifles. Our army lost 27 men and injured 60. The consumption of ammunition was 10,315 rounds. On the afternoon of the 14th, the First and Second Divisions and the machine gun company of our Eighth Detachment retreated to Guanli, Shaoyantun, Guojiatun, Bajiazi, and other places west of Yima River (105 li from Changchun and 35 li from Chalukou) to rest and replenish. 5. On the morning of the 15th, the headquarters of the Seventh Detachment posted proclamations to inform the farmers to quickly harvest their fields, with proper protection provided by the garrison troops in each area, and to provide the farmers with horses to speed up the harvest. On the 20th, the entire Jihai Railway was opened to traffic under the protection of the Japanese army. However, passenger and freight trains were still frequently ambushed by our army, so there were few passengers. On the 27th, the puppet state's rebel army of Zhang Haipeng's Seventeenth Regiment (Huang Regiment), Eighteenth Regiment (Han Regiment), and Fifteenth Regiment (Qin Regiment), as well as the First Brigade of the Jilin Garrison (Brigade Commander Zhang Junzhe is Zhang Haipeng's eldest son), arrived at the key stations on the Jihai Railway, forming a confrontational posture with our Seventh Detachment. On November 1, after the Eighth Detachment had completed its reorganization and replenishment, the headquarters moved to Koukoubao. We believed that since the Eighth Detachment had disregarded sacrifices and repeatedly defeated stubborn enemies since the start of the resistance against Japan, and since the frontier was already cold and the roads were covered with ice and snow, the soldiers were mostly wearing single-layer clothes and shoes. If there were no consolation, they would inevitably feel disheartened. Therefore, we sent Military Liaison Officer Wei Minggao with a letter to Koukoukou at Xinanbao to borrow 2 million strings of Jilin official notes (equivalent to 4,000 silver dollars) to reward the soldiers and encourage them. On the 2nd, the joint office of the political and military special commissioners of the Seventh and Eighth Detachments was established at Koukou River, with three sections: General Affairs, Military Affairs, and Propaganda. The General Affairs Section was divided into four units: Documentation, Dispatch, General Affairs, and Accounting. The Military Affairs Section was divided into two units: Organization and Training. The Propaganda Section was divided into an Editorial Unit and a Propaganda Team. There were also two confidential secretaries. On the 4th, Staff Officer Tian Zixin of the Kou Kou Detachment and Li Zhihe, the leader of the Propaganda Team, were dispatched to contact Luo Mingxing's army (nicknamed "Three Rivers Good") along the Jichang Railway, preparing to take action simultaneously in Jilin and Changchun at an appropriate time. 7. Staff Officer Tian and Team Leader Li returned on the 7th to report that Luo's army was willing to comply with the agreement and hoped to be reorganized into the National Salvation Army to jointly resist Japan. 6. The Seventh Detachment has now expanded to over 47,000 men (including over 14,000 men recruited from Liang's army [nicknamed "Dou Mountain Good"], over 1,500 men recruited from Zhang's army [nicknamed "Golden Mountain Good"], and many other small groups of three to five hundred men). The Eighth Detachment has not expanded since the Battle of Gongzhuling and currently has over 8,400 men. On the morning of the 7th, the Seventh Detachment received a report from Vice-Adjutant Lu Xudong of the First Regiment of the First Division that a regiment of rebel troops stationed in Shuanghezhen on the Jihai Railway was advancing towards Chalukou. After receiving the report, an emergency meeting was immediately convened, and it was decided that: 1. If we encounter troops who had been forced to surrender to the puppet state but are now returning to the fold and willing to cooperate with us sincerely, we should consider it carefully and act according to the situation to prevent a feigned surrender. 2. If we discover that the advancing troops have Japanese soldiers covering their rear, we should immediately attack them head-on, regardless of the circumstances. After the vote, Zhu Pengjiu, Commander of the Second Division of the Eighth Detachment, was ordered to lead his troops to the rear line and occupy positions in the Nanxiangshihezi area of the Fifth District of Yongji County, with the machine gun company providing cover for the left and right flanks. Liu Jingchun, Commander of the First Division, was ordered to take the second line and occupy positions in Erdaogou. The Seventh Detachment was to serve as a reserve force. At 10 AM, over 100 enemy vanguards were led by Adjutant Liu to seek an audience with Commander Zhu, claiming that "our army is ordered to proceed to Shuangyang. We are all Chinese, and we hope to be allowed to pass through." Commander Zhu generously agreed to their passage. However, as the main body of the enemy troops entered our defense area, they suddenly opened fire. Little did they know that our army was well-prepared. Their cunning can be said to have been a self-inflicted wound. Over 500 men were disarmed, and over 200 men from the mortar company were captured. According to the prisoners, they were the Fifteenth Regiment under the command of the rebel Zhang Haipeng, ordered to create disturbances under false pretenses. At dusk, 500 to 600 Japanese soldiers advanced towards our army under the cover of light machine gun squads. Commander Zhu ordered the machine gun company to flank the enemy's rear and sent a detachment of infantry to lure the enemy forward. When the enemy advanced to a position 5 li from Nanxiangshihezi, they fell directly into the machine gun company's position. Commander Zhu immediately ordered the machine guns to open fire. The Japanese soldiers were caught off guard and, due to their unfamiliarity with the terrain, fell into a heavy encirclement. Only two or three out of ten managed to escape. In this battle, our army captured four light machine guns, 15,225 rounds of ammunition, and 406 rifles. Our army suffered no deaths and over ten injuries. At 9 PM, another meeting was convened to: 1. Extend the defense line; 2. Dispatch personnel to establish close contact with friendly forces in the vicinity; 3. Request the general chamber of commerce to allocate weapons and ammunition. On the 11th, Propaganda Officer Wang Zuofei and four others were sent to establish contact with friendly forces.

<p>Visiting Feng in the Northern Frontier</p>
<h3 id="e94">Feng Strongly Advocates Using Force to Recover Lost Territory <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Zhangjiakou: Feng Yuxiang recently published a telegram, expressing his opinions on the current situation, which has attracted nationwide attention. Yesterday, our reporter made a special trip from Ping to Zhang to learn that Feng is residing at the old site of the library on Tuergou South Street, while Feng's entourage is living at Aiwulu on Tuergou North Street. The reporter first visited Feng's Secretary-General Wang Yiyuan at Aiwulu, who then introduced him to Feng on South Street. Feng's residence is in the middle of the street. A copper plate with the inscription "Feng's Residence" hangs on the black door. There is only one gatekeeper. The reception room is inside the gate. A long table in the room is used to serve tea to guests in earthenware teapots. Feng lives in three rooms in the north, with his wife and children. There is also a separate study room. When Feng received the reporter, he was wearing an old Zhongshan suit made of coarse blue cloth, with cloth-covered buttons in the middle, and a short sheepskin coat. His appearance was the same as before, but his hairline was mostly white. The following is a record of the conversation:</p>
<p>(Reporter asked) Will you attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee? (Feng answered) In the past, many resolutions have been proposed at the previous Second Plenary Session, or the titles of the proposals have been read aloud once. In my personal opinion, the resolutions should be implemented once they are passed. As for whether I will go to Nanjing to participate or not, I have not yet decided. (Asked) If you do not attend the Third Plenary Session, do you have any proposals? (Answered) I have several proposals that I am preparing to draft. The first proposal is to recover the lost territory by force, because I have always advocated using force to recover the lost territory. Without using force, there is no way to recover it one day. The Shanghai 19th Route Army's defeat of the Japanese army is an example. Second, I also have proposals on military affairs. (Asked) Since you moved to Zhangyuan, there have been many rumors from the outside world. What are your thoughts on this? (Answered) I received a telegram from Minister Luo earlier and sent a telegram to question him. He replied that it was a telegram from Jiang Zuobin from Japan. When I received Mr. Luo's telegram, I was very surprised, but after a long time, I remembered that people always add a crime to me. If they don't say I am a communist, they say I am a restorationist, so I sent out the Jiang telegram. However, when I opened the newspaper, I saw that many parts were omitted. Now I have opinions, but I am afraid that when I tell you (referring to the reporter), I will see the words "omitted." (Asked) What is your future plan? (Answered) Our ancestors left us a few words, teaching us to endure hardship and constantly think about revenge. Unexpectedly, some disappointing people have no concept of enduring hardship. Instead, they are lying down and taking their salaries. Isn't that infuriating? My future plan is to use force to save the country and endure hardship to do it. (Asked) What are your thoughts on the Northeastern Volunteer Army? (Answered) Recently, I heard that there is a local gentleman in Heishan County named Sun Hongyou, who is already in his eighties. Because of his resentment towards the Japanese invasion, he destroyed his home to help the country and summoned the Volunteer Army to fight against the Japanese army. The Japanese army later used a large force to suppress them. He led the Volunteer Army to Xinlitun and continued to resist. It is truly admirable and respectable for an old man in his eighties to do this. Others, such as Ma Zhanshan and Zhu Jiqing, are all fighting in the snow and ice. I have already sent letters to comfort them. (Asked) What are your criticisms of the League of Nations? (Answered) I have begun to write a report criticizing the investigation team, which will be published before the League of Nations meeting. (Asked) Will you be leaving Chahar recently? (Answered) I have decided not to leave this place for the time being. The rumors of going to Shandong or Guangdong are not true. After the conversation, the reporter said goodbye. It is said that Feng's daily life is mostly spent reading and learning foreign languages, and his mood is still quite relaxed. (20th)</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Attacks Xufu Again</p>
<h3 id="e95">Deng, Tian, and Liu Issue Joint Telegram to Cease Fire <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Hankou: Liu Xiang launched a heavy attack on Luzhou and Fushun. After a bloody battle for ten days, Liu Wenhui's troops resisted stubbornly, making it difficult to capture quickly. When a conflict occurred between Liu Wenhui's and Tian Songyao's armies in Chengdu, Liu Wenhui, to avoid being attacked from both sides, specially withdrew the defending troops from Luzhou and Fushun to the Minjiang River basin to coordinate with both sides. On the 18th, Liu Xiang's army occupied Fushun, Neijiang, Gongjing, and Zigong. On the 21st, it also occupied Luzhou. Liu Xiang had solemnly stated to Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, and others when he launched the second general offensive that he would withdraw his troops immediately after Luzhou and Neijiang were captured and would never prolong the war. This time, after Luzhou and Neijiang were captured, Liu Wenhui's army retreated far away. Liu Xiang suddenly dispatched Pan Wenhua, Tang Shizun, Wang Zhiyi, and other troops to take advantage of the victory and attack Xufu, occupying Jiang'an on the left and Rongwei on the right, advancing towards Xufu, no more than 100 li from Liu Wenhui's rear. It is now heard that Liu Xiang stated that he must capture Xufu before he can cease the war. Liu Wenhui also stated that he can give up Xufu and retreat to Baoding. Therefore, from the surface, Liu Xiang seems to have an absolute victory, while Liu Wenhui seems to be in a defeated position. However, it is heard that Liu Wenhui's army suffered no losses during the retreat, while Liu Xiang's army suffered great sacrifices in attacking the city. Although he obtained the resources of Luzhou and Neijiang, the vitality was damaged after the destruction. Therefore, the victory or defeat cannot yet be judged in reality.</p>
<p>Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao, although they seem to favor different sides on the surface, have consistent interests and the same policies. However, Deng is more composed among the generals. Since the outbreak of the war, in addition to claiming to follow the central government's orders to mediate by force, he has never expressed his true attitude. When Neijiang and Fushun were occupied by Liu Xiang's army on the 18th, he sent a telegram to all parties on the 19th to call for peace. The telegram stated, "To Superintendent Liu of Chongqing and all division and brigade commanders and commanders of the 21st Army, Superintendent Liu of Suiding and all division and brigade commanders and commanders of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Defense Army, Army Commander Yang Zihui of Guang'an and all division and brigade commanders and commanders of the 20th Army, Army Commander Liu Zigan of Chengdu and all division and brigade commanders and commanders of the 24th Army, Army Commander Tian Songyao and all division and brigade commanders and commanders, Division Commander Li Qixiang, and Division Commander Luo Pingzhang, since the outbreak of the Sichuan war, Xihou has repeatedly received telegrams from the central government to mediate and run around to resolve the conflict. His tongue is parched and his lips are dry, but both sides are deadlocked and refuse to yield. As far as Luzhou and Ziyang and as close as the provincial capital, in field battles and street battles, countless people have died. The people have suffered from the swords and spears, and the houses have been turned into ruins. The tragic situation is unbearable to hear. If the purpose is to seek long-term peace and stability in Sichuan, then Division Commander Tang's Outline for Governing Sichuan has been endorsed by all parties. Chairman Liu's Jiang telegram also advocates the same approach. It can be seen that both sides have similar intentions. It is hoped that a meeting can be held to discuss the details and implement the central government's efforts to promote the implementation. Unfortunately, before the cup was opened, the war started. To wage war in order to achieve good governance is to make the people suffer before they can enjoy happiness. Why not first use the law to restrain each other? If the comrades still insist, sanctions will not be too late. At a time when the national crisis is deepening and foreign countries are watching, internal strife is endless, which is a cause for criticism. Moreover, the people of Sichuan are haggard and their vitality has not recovered. Such devastation is unbearable to imagine. Xihou is burdened with a heavy responsibility and the lives of the people are at stake. For the sake of the country and Sichuan, he cannot ignore this. In his earnestness, he appeals for a ceasefire and respectfully asks you to abandon your prejudices and adopt his humble suggestions. On the one hand, order the troops on the front lines to immediately cease military actions. On the other hand, agree on a date for a meeting to discuss the overall plan in detail. The use of force should be the last resort, and negotiation should be the first. The solution should be sought through political means, and war should not be waged in the local area again. The country will be fortunate, and Sichuan will be fortunate. With tears in his eyes, he submits his words and awaits your clear instructions. Your brother, Deng Xihou." But the effectiveness of this telegram is yet to be seen.</p>
<p>In Chengdu, Liu Wenhui's and Tian Songyao's troops fought fiercely for three days and three nights, from the 16th to the 19th. Tian's army suffered slight losses. As a result of Deng Xihou's mediation, Tian's army withdrew from the city. Deng issued a Hao telegram on the one hand and invited Liu and Tian to cooperate on the other. On the 21st, Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, and Tian Songyao issued a joint telegram to cease fire. The generals of the three armies issued telegrams of support at the same time. The armies are like clouds and rain, and it is not known when the chaos in Sichuan will end. (23rd)</p>

<p>People of Fengjing Request Establishment of a Junior High School: The ancestors of Xu Xingtao, a gentleman from Fengjing, donated fields to the public, designating them for the operation of schools. Recently, Xu Xingtao, a descendant, expressed dissatisfaction with the education authorities' poor management, which resulted in a loss of 40,000 yuan in the Songjiang Bank. He submitted a petition to the Education Bureau, stating that his ancestors had donated fields to the Yun Jian Qiu Zhong Jing Xian Three Academies to benefit the scholars and promote culture. Since the reorganization into the Education Bureau, it has been used specifically for education purposes. Now, with an annual rent of about 4,000 yuan, the accumulated funds are quite considerable. If properly preserved and used to establish more schools, the original donors would benefit. However, the authorities deposited the money in the bank, where it was coveted by unscrupulous merchants, who embezzled over 100,000 yuan of education funds. Who is responsible for this disaster? It is heartbreaking to speak of it. At present, Songjiang lacks junior high schools, especially Fengjing. Every time high school graduates are unable to go out, they linger and drop out of school, all because Fengjing does not have a junior high school. Therefore, he requested the Education Bureau to submit a request to the county government to establish a junior high school in Fengjing with the accumulated education funds to prevent the children of Fengjing from being denied access to education.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Anti-Japanese Association Defendant Attempts Suicide: Huang Zixin, <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>a member of the Wu County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, Shi Zhifan, an employee, and Sheng Zhixing, and others were reported by the County Party Department to the court for embezzlement and malpractice. After several investigations by the court, the case was complicated and no public prosecution was filed. Yesterday (20th), the local prosecutor's office summoned Sheng Zhixing and others for another court investigation and ordered them to remain on bail. However, Huang Zixin, an important figure in the case, was an important figure in the Wu County labor community, serving as the labor representative of the County Government Labor Arbitration Committee, as well as the chairman of the woodworking union, and a standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese Association. He felt that he had been falsely accused in this case. Yesterday morning (24th), he secretly swallowed cologne and opium paste to commit suicide. Fortunately, his family discovered it early and urgently summoned doctors Li Guangxun and Zhang Buxiong to save him. He was fortunate to be reborn. After the poisoning, a suicide note was found near him, which has been sent to the local prosecutor's office for filing by his brother.</p>

<p>Ministry of Finance reorganized the anti-smuggling agency into the tax police, Ling Xichao, the chief of the Fourth District, has worked diligently to handle the tax police affairs of the three counties of Suzhou, Wu, Changshu, and Kunshan. In particular, the ports of Hupu, Luyuan, and Fushan in Changshu are the gateway to the Yangtze River and are strategically important. Most of the distribution of smuggled salt passes through these ports. Therefore, he inspected Changshu yesterday and summoned the officers of the patrol boats under his command to instruct them on the direction of their work. After completing his official duties, he returned to Suzhou by boat yesterday. According to recent investigations, the monthly sales in the district have increased by more than 500 shares. The prosperity of official sales is unprecedented. According to those in the salt industry, Chief Ling is very serious in handling official duties, which is why he has been able to achieve such remarkable results.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Suicide by a Traveler Taking Poison at the Ben Niu Inn on East Lake Road <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The First Inn, on the evening of the 21st of this month around 10 PM, received a single traveler. He claimed his name was An Fusheng, 30 years old, from Ben Niu. He came from Shanghai to Wuxi. The tea server attended to him, and he booked room number 32. Since he had no luggage, he paid the room fee of 3 jiao and 2 fen in advance. The next morning, he asked the tea server to bring water to wash his face and lamented his misfortune, muttering to himself. He said he had been a tailor in Shanghai but liked to gamble, causing financial difficulties. He had a younger sister who was a prostitute on Fourth Avenue, so he borrowed money from her. However, his sister not only refused but also incited thugs to beat him severely, leaving him covered in bruises. The tea server didn't pay much attention to this. Soon after, An went out and returned around 10 PM the night before last, booking the same room. He asked the tea server for a writing brush, inkstone, stationery, and envelopes, and locked himself in to write. However, by 10 AM yesterday, the guest hadn't gotten up yet. The tea server became suspicious, knocked on the door, and called out, but there was no response. He then pried open the door and saw the guest with a pale face and saliva flowing from his mouth. He was already dead. His bedding was stained with raw opium liquid. It was then realized that he had committed suicide by taking poison. Beside him was a suicide note. Afterwards, Hua Hegao, the manager of the inn, along with the local warden Xi Zhiliang, reported the matter to the county court and requested an autopsy. Prosecutor Shen led officials to conduct the autopsy, confirming that it was indeed suicide by poisoning. After the autopsy, he instructed the warden to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Although the authorities are diligently tracking down criminals, it's like walking through thorns everywhere, making it impossible to prevent everything. The day before yesterday, two robbery cases occurred one after another. 1) Hu, the wife of Hua Yinqiao, a resident near the City Orphanage, was carrying two children and going home after shopping at Dashiqiao at 10 AM yesterday when she was robbed of a gold ear pick by thugs while passing by Ba'erfang. Hua Hu shouted loudly to catch the thief. People gathered upon hearing the cries and apprehended the thug, handing him over to the police, who took him to the First Precinct. Officer Qin held a preliminary hearing. The thug confessed that his name was Wang Afu, 28 years old, from Dongmen, and sold firewood for a living. He admitted to robbing the gold ornament. After the confession was verified, the documents were prepared and transferred to the central bureau for further investigation. 2) Yesterday afternoon around 7 PM, two female travelers from Shanghai arrived in Wuxi by train, intending to visit relatives in Jiangyinfang outside the North Gate. While walking near the three-way intersection of the Railway Hotel, they hesitated because they didn't know the way. Suddenly, three thugs approached and asked where they were going. The women replied that they wanted to visit relatives in Jiangyinfang. The thugs, seeing an opportunity, falsely directed them to go east. The women, suspecting nothing, walked near the slaughterhouse next to the railway when the thugs drew weapons, silenced them, robbed them of a gold bracelet and more than ten silver dollars, and fled.</p>

<p>The Farmers' Association Petitions the Province to Abolish Surcharges: The County Farmers' Association, according to a petition from Zhang Yiru, a cadre of the Sixth District Farmers' Association, stated that Jiangyin, bordering the Yangtze River, has poor land and impoverished people. The land price is no more than ten yuan per mu. This autumn, the rice price is low, and farmers are in dire straits. However, the Finance Bureau of the County Government has raised land prices and levied excessive taxes, increasing the mu tax, such as the 5-fen temporary mu tax, the 2-fen grain storage mu tax, and the 2-fen household tax. Surcharges even exceed three times the regular tax, which is truly unbearable for farmers. They specifically request that the Provincial Government be petitioned to abolish these taxes in accordance with the law to alleviate the people's suffering in Jiangsu.</p>

<p>Last month, he reported that Qing middle school students Li and Jiang Zuyuan had reactionary connections. After investigation by the county, the evidence was confirmed. They were sent to the Provincial Provisional Military Tribunal for investigation.

<p>The public primary and secondary schools in the county, because the Education Bureau owes wages for eight months, are on the verge of running out of funds and cannot maintain operations. On the 22nd, they held a joint meeting at the Education Bureau to discuss the matter of the overdue payments. It was decided on the spot that at least three months' worth of salaries should be paid first. The schools previously received tax certificates for the first land price tax of the Republic of China's 21st year issued by the Finance Bureau, which were difficult to cash and suffered intangible losses. They requested that the relevant government authorities prohibit issuing such certificates in the future. After the meeting, the Director of the Education Bureau, Wang Ruo, and the principals of various schools, including Jiang Jingbo, went to the County Government Finance Bureau to petition. After repeated consultations, the Director of the Finance Bureau agreed to raise 15,000 yuan to pay one month's salary to maintain operations.</p>

<p>A suspicious Japanese person found in Baitang, who was suspected of engaging in activities inland, had a hunting rifle, 79 bullets, a suitcase, two cameras, and two photographs confiscated by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the county. Judge Chai questioned him. According to the interpreter, his name was Takagi Chiyo Taro, also known as Hattori Takeshi. The boatman's name was Xu Fangyuan, 55 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, and had been a Japanese citizen since childhood. He was a yarn merchant and liked antiques. On the 17th of this month, he came from Shanghai to Kunshan, arriving in Suzhou the next day. On the 19th, he came to Dongtang City in this county, inspecting cotton and rice along the way and hunting for recreation. On the 20th, he was reported to the police by residents in Tangqiao. However, he claimed that they came to Changshu to purchase cotton and travel inland, with no other intentions. Hattori Takeshi claimed to be Japanese and did not understand Chinese, so Takagi answered on his behalf. According to boat owner Xu Fangyuan, he was from Yangzhou and usually sailed in Suzhou. He was hired by Takagi to come to Changshu for six days, with a daily boat fee of two yuan. As a result, it was decided that police would be dispatched on the 23rd to escort him to the Wu County Public Security Bureau and then to the consulate for further action. It was found that Takagi Chiyo Taro had secretly come to Changshu during the Shanghai War this spring, hiding in the Datong Inn in the South Gate. He was arrested by the Public Security Bureau and deported for soliciting prostitutes.</p>

They said that Liu's army was brave and good at fighting and should be sent to the Northeast to strengthen the border, but deploying them in eastern Zhejiang seemed ill-considered. Furthermore, Shaoxing is in the hinterland and relatively peaceful, with the bandit atmosphere in neighboring counties gradually being suppressed. There is no need to station heavy troops. They jointly telegraphed, requesting the withdrawal of the troop deployment order to Zhejiang and also telegraphed the seven county associations in Shanghai, advocating for unanimous opposition.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Sun Ke's Observations After the League of Nations Meeting <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲The League of Nations' Final Measures May Still Involve Sanctions</p>
<p>▲Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations Will Not Become a Reality</p>
<p>▲China Can Only Overcome Difficulties if the Government and People are United</p>
<p>The League of Nations convened a meeting this time, but before formally considering the Lytton Report, the meeting was already deadlocked. Seeing that the League of Nations has repeatedly convened meetings without effective measures, China declared its intention to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant, requesting sanctions against Japan. Japan, in turn, threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations. At the same time, there were also issues related to the islands in the South Pacific that the League of Nations entrusted to Japan for administration. As a result, some observers speculated that Japan's attitude was so strong that the Northeast issue could not be resolved peacefully. If the League of Nations implemented sanctions, another world war would inevitably occur. However, Chinese delegate Sun Zhesheng did not think so. The following is a record of Sun's recent observations on the international situation:</p>
<p>Predictions on the League of Nations: Sun, in response to questions from the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, stated that the interests of European and American countries differed, and their positions also varied. The Northeast issue could have been sanctioned this time, but because Britain and the United States could not agree, and France could not cooperate with Britain, it affected the League of Nations' actions against Japan. The United States first opposed Japan's aggressive policies. When U.S. Secretary of State Stimson issued a declaration that the United States would not recognize the current situation in Northeast China as an accomplished fact, Britain, France, and other countries made no expression. France secretly sided with Japan at the time. Recently, due to the military reduction issue, France has changed its pro-Japanese attitude, but Britain and France still disagree on this issue. Japan also used this disagreement to cope. In addition, there are other disagreements that make it unlikely that the League of Nations will immediately impose sanctions on Japan. According to my observation, the League of Nations' handling of the Northeast issue will likely be delayed and remain unresolved.</p>
<p>Japan Will Not Withdraw: Sun stated that Japan's threatened withdrawal from the League of Nations is unlikely to happen unless the League of Nations takes firm measures that are unfavorable to Japan. Since the League of Nations cannot take unified sanctions, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations is not a current reality.</p>
<p>World War II: Sun believes that a second world war is perhaps inevitable, but it will take at least three to five years of preparation. The outbreak of war depends on the United States. The United States is not prepared for war, and it has not completed the warship construction program allowed by the Washington Conference. However, Japan is desperately expanding its naval armaments. Britain is also showing weakness to Japan in the East. At the same time, Britain is constrained by many other issues and cannot do anything. Therefore, although there are rumors of a second world war due to the seriousness of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant and the League of Nations' attention to the islands in the South Pacific entrusted to Japan for administration because Japan is about to withdraw from the League of Nations, it is unlikely to become a reality.</p>
<p>The Government Must Have Resolve: Sun concluded by saying that the League of Nations' solution to the Northeast issue is, for the moment, bound to make us pessimistic. However, the only way to cope is for those in charge of the government to make up their minds and work with the people to come up with various methods, such as expanding military preparations and actively resisting, so that military and economic measures are thorough. Only then can we defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>Consuls of Various Countries in Shanghai Mostly Express Goodwill Towards China</p>
<h3 id="e117">Many are Outraged by Japan's Violation of International Conventions <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the League of Nations Council has already met to discuss the Sino-Japanese incident. Japanese representative Matsuoka is actively working in Geneva, hoping to shirk Japan's responsibility for violating international conventions in order to achieve its desire for armed aggression. However, the representatives of various countries are well aware of its conspiracy and will severely sanction countries that violate international conventions in order to maintain justice and safeguard world peace. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter learned from foreign nationals in Shanghai, excluding those from Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, about the attitudes of other countries towards the Sino-Japanese incident:</p>
<p>Spain: Yesterday, the reporter went to the Spanish Consulate to inquire. Because the Spanish Consul General in Shanghai, Ferrer, was away on official business, Deputy Consul Sarracoechea received the reporter. According to him, Sino-Spanish relations have always been very harmonious. Spain dares to say that it is China's best friend. Since the signing of the Sino-Spanish Commercial Treaty in 1864, the nationals of both countries have abided by the agreements, and no incidents have occurred. Examining the facts of the past can prove that the Spanish government has always expressed goodwill towards China in past incidents. He continued, saying that there are currently more than 700 Spanish nationals residing in China, with more than 280 in Shanghai, mostly merchants and Catholic missionaries. As for the current state of Sino-Spanish trade, it is becoming increasingly close. The export of Chinese goods is better than the import of Spanish goods. According to a survey in the 19th year of the Republic of China, Spanish goods shipped to China were only 57,604 customs taels, while Chinese goods shipped to Spain were 790,649 customs taels. Spanish goods mainly consist of wine, cork, olive oil, and fish, while Chinese goods mainly consist of tea, silk, tin, eggs, embroidery, porcelain, and antiques. Minister Garrido is stationed in Beiping and will be going south soon.</p>
<p>Brazil: According to a spokesperson from the Brazilian Consulate in Shanghai, there are only about 100 Brazilian people residing in China, with about 80 in Shanghai. Although there is no deep interaction between the two countries, Sino-Brazilian relations have always been harmonious. Since the signing of the Sino-Brazilian Commercial Treaty in 1881, the relationship between the two countries has become increasingly close and urgently needs to be revised. Therefore, Minister Velloso will be going south to meet with Foreign Minister Luo to revise the commercial treaty. The Brazilian government has always expressed outrage at countries that violate international conventions.</p>
<p>Sweden: The reporter went to the Swedish Consulate to inquire, but Consul General Lilllehook was being treated at the Lester Chinese Hospital on North Suzhou Road due to illness, so no details could be obtained. However, it was learned that Lilllehook's illness was gradually improving and he could be discharged from the hospital next Wednesday. It was also learned that the Swedish government and people expressed outrage at the Japanese destruction of international conventions and sympathized with China.</p>
<p>Switzerland: Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Lardy, will be promoted to Charge d'Affaires in China. Although the official announcement has not yet arrived in Shanghai, the increasingly close relationship between China and Switzerland is sufficient proof. There are about 280 Swiss nationals in Shanghai, all of whom are merchants. Various international organizations are located in Switzerland, so the government and people of Switzerland respect all international conventions. Consul General Lardy did not make explicit comments on the Sino-Japanese issue, but his sympathy for China was revealed in his conversations.</p>
<p>Mexico: Mexican Consul in Shanghai Allman is a lawyer and is currently working as a lawyer in Shanghai, so he did not want to comment on everything.</p>
<h3 id="e118">National Lawyers Association Refutes Matsuoka's Sophistry <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲Secret Meeting Minutes Obtained from Japanese Person</p>
<p>▲Hope Friendly Nations' Representatives Will Not Be Deceived</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Association of the Republic of China, in response to Japanese representative Matsuoka's rebuttal of Chinese representative Gu's speech, in which he attacked the secret meeting minutes of the Japanese Colonial Affairs Ministry discovered by the association last year, claiming they were fabricated, sent a telegram refuting the claim and urging all representatives to pay attention to the Japanese diplomatic policy towards China in the record. The telegram is recorded below: "To Dr. Gu Weijun, Chinese Representative to Geneva, for transmittal to representatives of all nations: In his rebuttal, Japanese representative Matsuoka cunningly stated that the Tanaka Memorial was a forgery and later said, 'Some Chinese, seeing the success of deceiving foreigners by forging documents, seem quite excited and have produced another forged document called the Minutes of the Meeting of the Japanese Colonial Affairs Ministry.' In order to avoid confusing international public opinion, this association cannot remain silent. The aforementioned secret meeting minutes of the Japanese Colonial Affairs Ministry were obtained by an employee of this association from a Japanese person in Harbin. This is an undeniable fact. How can it be called a forgery? Moreover, the contents of the meeting minutes, which state that Japan's diplomatic policy before the Washington Conference was to use barbarians to control barbarians, using the name of international coordination to have the great powers act as Japan's plainclothes troops in China, and that after the Washington Conference, it was to use Chinese to control Chinese, using the tactic of sowing discord to achieve its goal of hindering China's unification, further proves that the backbone of Japanese diplomacy is none other than deceiving the great powers and invading China. This is a vile and treacherous policy, and they are still using this approach to operate actively in the Far East and the League of Nations. We hope that the representatives of all friendly nations will pay close attention to this, not be blinded by sweet words, and not be intimidated by threats. Then the Far East will be fortunate, the world will be fortunate. Sincerely, Liu Liumin, Jiang Yong, Yan Yinwu, Dai Tianqiu, and Liu Zhejing, Standing Committee Members of the National Lawyers Association of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3 id="e119">The National People's Salvation Association Closed Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>

As a result, the Shanghai, Fujian, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Southwest Association, Hebei, Tianjin, Beiping, Guangxi, Zhejiang, and Hunan associations were elected as executive members. The Anhui, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Nanjing associations were elected as supervisory members. The chairman delivered the closing remarks.

Since the opening of the meeting, the order has been very good, and the spirit of the representatives has been exceptionally high.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Yu Yuan Heng Foreign Goods Store Suddenly Attacked with Bombs and Guns <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲Three People Entered and Threw a Bomb that Did Not Explode</p>
<p>▲Two Employees Gave Chase and Were Seriously Wounded by Gunfire</p>
<p>▲Anti-Traitor Group Explains the Reason for the Warning</p>
<p>The Yu Yuan Heng Foreign Goods Store, located in Yenkang Lane at the intersection of Shansi Road and Guankou Road, was originally located on Jixiang Street in the French Concession. Recently, it moved to this location due to the renovation of the buildings there. Yesterday afternoon around 3 PM, three young people suddenly came to the store, one wearing short clothes and two wearing long robes. They entered and asked why an order from a certain number had not been delivered. Then, they took out a bomb from their side and threw it into the courtyard of the store. However, it did not explode. Wu Zhuxian, a store clerk, and Huang Yiyong, an old accountant, happened to be in the reception room. Seeing that the bomb had not exploded, they rashly gave chase. One of the young people who had just exited the gate noticed and immediately drew a pistol, shooting at the two men. Both shots hit, and the men fell to the ground. The three young men then calmly escaped. Seeing that the store clerks had been injured, the store urgently reported the incident to the Zhabei Police Station. They dispatched detectives to investigate. The unexploded bomb was taken to the police station for safekeeping, and the two injured men were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Wu Zhuxian, the clerk, is 62 years old, from Jiading. The bullet entered from the front of his left leg and exited through his bladder. Huang Yiyong, the old accountant, is 49 years old, from Ningbo. The bullet hit his abdomen. Both men are in critical condition. Because Wu is over sixty years old, his condition is even more dangerous, with little hope of recovery. It is also reported that the store has repeatedly received warning letters from anti-traitor groups in the past few months, alleging that the store is still continuing to sell inferior goods, which led to this disaster.</p>
<p>After the incident, the China National Soul Anti-Traitor Group sent letters to various newspapers, stating their warning letter to Yu Yuan Heng Store: "The owner of Yu Yuan Heng Store knows that you have been found to be selling enemy goods. After several warnings from this group, the store has been deaf and ignored it. This group is using preliminary means to warn you. After seeing this letter, if you still do not wake up, this group will use the final means to deal with you. China National Soul Anti-Traitor Group."</p>
<p>Levying Increased Import Tariff on Foreign Rice</p>
<h3 id="e121">Song Ziwen Is Seriously Considering <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter had an audience with President Song of the Executive Yuan and inquired about regulating the people's food supply and increasing import tariffs on foreign rice. He provided a detailed explanation of the advantages and disadvantages, which are recorded below. This year, our country has a bumper harvest, and rice prices are extremely low in rice-producing areas. As the saying goes, "cheap grain hurts farmers," so it is urgent to circulate domestically produced rice and increase import tariffs on foreign rice to achieve regulation. I have long been paying attention to this matter. However, if various local taxes and levies on rice transported out of the provinces cannot be uniformly abolished, then regulation will be merely empty talk. What deserves particular attention is that provinces such as Fujian and Guangdong have always been short of rice and rely heavily on imported rice from Annam and Siam to feed their people. If we rashly increase import tariffs on foreign rice, the effect of regulation may not be seen, and a portion of the population will suffer from the impact of restricted sales first. Therefore, the government is carefully considering and planning comprehensively to ensure that surplus rice in rice-producing provinces can be circulated, while rice-deficient provinces are spared from the harm of high rice prices, so as to avoid favoring one side at the expense of the other, etc.</p>

<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the case of the China Merchants Bureau borrowing money from abroad and mortgaging its original wharf properties for 30 million taels has been under judicial review since being nationalized and Li Guojie was dismissed. The details of the case have already been revealed. However, the court's investigation of the contract has found that Chen Fumu, the former supervisor who approved the original contract, is indeed significantly related and must be summoned to appear. However, the summons, after being translated and telegraphed by the China Merchants Bureau, was sent to the Hong Kong branch for delivery but has not been successfully delivered. Yesterday, a reply telegram stated that Chen's whereabouts were unknown and could not be delivered. Therefore, the Bureau has returned the summons to the Nanjing Municipal District Court. Other news is compiled and recorded below:</p>
<p>Cancellation of the Contract: Yesterday, a reporter met with Secretary Xu of the Bureau. According to him, the contract issue is currently being investigated with the China Business Corporation regarding all exchanged documents. Fortunately, only a portion of the payment has been made, so it should not cause a major incident. However, this matter involves the law and cannot be resolved through personal negotiations. Therefore, the Board of Directors has hired lawyers Qin Liankui and Wang Youling to study everything. Whether or not to cancel the contract has not yet been decided, nor has any contact been initiated with the other party.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Debt Committee: In the afternoon, a reporter visited Executive Director Ye Zhuotang at the China Merchants Bureau and inquired about the establishment of a committee to reorganize the Bureau's debts. According to Ye, the list of seven members for the Debt Committee is currently being finalized. Although some names have appeared in the newspapers, the full list will be announced in a day or two. Discussions are currently underway regarding the operation of the committee and the allocation of shares, so it is not possible to release any information at this time.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Righteous Army Arrive in Shanghai Seeking Assistance</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Mission of Zhou Xunyu and Others <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Xunyu, Chief of Staff of the 16th Route of the Liaoning Righteous Army, Zeng Wowo, Chief Counselor, and Liu Shi, Zhang Guowei, and others, carrying official documents from Zhan Taojun, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern National Salvation Allied Army, and the calling card of Shi Lingge, Commander of the 16th Route, arrived in Shanghai to report on the situation to the Northeastern Righteous Army Relief Association and request assistance. The original text reads: "Respectfully submitted: Due to the misfortune of the nation and the fall of the Northeast, after years of bloody battles, half of the territory has been recovered. If we do not continue to resist, it will be difficult to break the ambitions of imperialism. Since our army began the war of resistance, despite all the hardships, our determination to kill the enemy has never wavered. Since swearing an oath, we have led our subordinates, including Ji Handong, Shi Ling, Zhang Wei, Yuan Wu Delin, Wu Zuohua, Zhang Mingwu, Huang Yonghan, and others, a total of more than 43,500 people, in fierce battles against the enemy in the Jinzhou, Chaoyang, Shenyang, and Xinmin areas. We have twice entered and exited the Shenyang Airport for hand-to-hand combat more than ten times, and recently in Liaoxi, Chaoyang Temple, Yixian County, Liulongtai, and other places, we have killed dozens of enemies and seized various types of firearms, horses, and military supplies. However, as autumn turns to winter, the borderlands have already frozen over, and officers and soldiers are clad in thin clothing and broken shoes, suffering from hunger and cold, with no means of support. Moreover, the enemy, taking advantage of the fall of the green screen, relies on its sophisticated equipment and weapons, concentrating its elite troops to attack us from time to time. At this time of internal and external difficulties, it is extremely difficult to cope. Although there are national salvation soldiers and patriotic organizations in the rear, and overseas compatriots are enthusiastically donating, the remote roads make it too slow to provide immediate relief. After repeated consideration, for the sake of national salvation and military convenience, we have specially dispatched Zhou Xunyu, Zeng Wowo, Liu Shi, Zhang Guowei, and others to represent the entire army to enter the pass, present everything in person, and implore you to sympathize with the suffering of our warriors and provide as much assistance as possible, so that our iron-blooded men can have no worries and devote all their efforts to killing the enemy. If the work of national salvation is not abandoned halfway, the recovery of the three northeastern provinces can be expected, and the 30 million people will once again see the blue sky and white sun. We eagerly await your orders."</p>

<p>Li Fuxun Discusses the Financial Industry of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia</p>
<h3 id="e127">Believes It Should Be Rationalized <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Banking leader Li Fuxun recently sent his daughter to England to study and took the opportunity to investigate the situation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, after the January 28th Incident, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia provided significant assistance, and the majority of remittances were entrusted to Li for distribution. As an encouragement, he simultaneously represented the beneficiaries in expressing their gratitude. Upon his return, he wrote this to inform the people of the country. The article recognizes that the rationalization of the financial industry of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia is the key to resolving the economic panic of overseas Chinese, and it is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and the Efforts We Should Make: The activities of overseas Chinese occupy an extremely important position in our country's national economy. For many years, trade has shown a huge deficit, relying on remittances from overseas Chinese to make up the difference. Whenever there are floods, droughts, or famines, overseas Chinese donate generously, and their enthusiastic support during the January 28th Incident, amounting to millions of dollars, is particularly commendable. Therefore, in today's context, to develop the national economy, there is no doubt that we must seek cooperation in capital and talent between the country and overseas Chinese. Southeast Asia is the center of overseas Chinese activity. Overseas Chinese account for more than half of the population of the Straits Settlements, and in Singapore, where its capital is located, overseas Chinese account for two-thirds of the population. In addition, overseas Chinese are scattered throughout the Malay states and the East Indies archipelago, and their numbers are also large. When we travel to various parts of Southeast Asia, there is hardly a place where we do not see Chinese-style buildings. Being in such a place is like being on our own land. In terms of economic power, overseas Chinese own many mines and rubber plantations. Overseas Chinese also occupy the majority of merchants and brokers. Today, Westerners still cannot but give credit to overseas Chinese for the development of Southeast Asia. The reason for this is profound. However, our attention to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia lies not in their large number and great power, but especially in the depth of their relationship with the motherland. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia usually remit tens of millions to 200 million yuan to the motherland, accounting for more than 80% of the total remittances from overseas Chinese. Due to the enthusiastic remittances from overseas Chinese, the Chinese-owned financial industry in Southeast Asia has emerged in response to the times. Furthermore, since the majority of remittances from overseas Chinese are entrusted to Chinese-owned financial institutions, the exchange between Southeast Asia and Hong Kong and various ports in the country is entirely under the control of the Chinese-owned financial industry. We must pay even more attention to the fact that when the powers develop colonies, they often use political and financial power as the vanguard, and industrial and commercial power arises from this. However, our overseas Chinese are able to establish a foundation for industry and commerce with their bare hands and then complete their highest financial power, from a state of no unity and no organization to a systematic economic organization. Under the weak political protection of the motherland, they have established their amazing great achievements. Their spirit of hard work and struggle is truly admirable. In recent years, the world has experienced an unprecedented panic. The main businesses of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, namely tin mines and rubber, have both suffered significant blows due to overproduction and plummeting prices. In addition, with restrictions on immigration in various places, the number of overseas Chinese has been decreasing day by day, and remittances to the country have been sharply reduced as a result. The Chinese-owned financial industry in Southeast Asia has been deeply affected. In order to adapt to the environment by forming alliances, the Chinese Commercial Bank, the Ho Hong Bank, and the Overseas-Chinese Bank merged. These three banks all have strong influence in Southeast Asia. Among the three banks, the Chinese Commercial Bank was established the earliest, the Overseas-Chinese Bank had the largest capital, and the Ho Hong Bank was the most prosperous. The main points are listed below:</p>
<p>Year of Establishment Capital Paid-Up Capital &amp; Reserves Deposits</p>
<p>China Commercial Bank 1922 1,000,000.00 1,172,865.78 4,100,90.24.23</p>
<p>Ho Hong Bank 1917 4,000,000.00 20,746,240,.09</p>
<p>Overseas-Chinese Bank 1920 5,250,000.00 656,425.70 8,381,317.95</p>
<p>The above figures are based on last year's financial statements. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar. Long history, strong capital, and extensive business are all elements for the development of the banking business. Observing the above points, we anticipate that the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, which will be formed after the reorganization, will definitely gather the strengths of the original three banks and eliminate their weaknesses. Therefore, this merger is not only a passive response to the current difficult environment, but also actively sufficient to open a new era for the financial industry of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Its definite and significant benefits are: 1) Monopoly on the exchange between Southeast Asia and Hong Kong and between Southeast Asia and various ports in the country. In the past, due to the same attention to remittances from overseas Chinese to the country, there was considerable competition in business between the three banks. In recent years, due to the reduction in remittances, competition has become increasingly fierce, and business income has decreased. After the merger, remittances will be concentrated, and with the strength of its capital, it will undoubtedly monopolize remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. 2) Saving expenses and increasing net profit. According to last year's financial statements, the expenses of the three banks were 117,000 yuan (Straits Settlements dollars, similarly hereinafter) for the Chinese Commercial Bank, 714,000 yuan for the Ho Hong Bank, and 407,000 yuan for the Overseas-Chinese Bank, totaling 1.24 million yuan. After the merger, at least one-third, about 400,000 yuan, can be saved. Therefore, a single item of expense savings can increase net profit considerably. 3) Developing business and expanding influence. The Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, which will be formed after the merger of the three banks, will have large capital and the history and status of the three banks. As a result, not only will the loyal customers of the three banks have even stronger faith, but the general public will also tend to trade with it. The progress of business is beyond doubt. After appropriately reducing the original branches of the three banks, it can use its remaining strength to set up business organizations in places where its business influence has not yet reached. The prosperity of the business can be expected. Finance is the key to all matters. If we want to revive the economic power of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, we must first make the Chinese-owned financial industry in Southeast Asia stable. In order to consolidate the financial power of Chinese-owned banks in Southeast Asia, in addition to the rationalization of the organization mentioned above, the domestic economic community must provide appropriate assistance. In the financial industry of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, the passive</p>
<p>aspect is that the financial business of Southeast Asia must be entrusted to the newly formed Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, and there is no need to compete with it. Otherwise, the unnecessary competition between the three banks, which was fortunately eliminated by the merger, will be revived by the domestic financial industry, which will suddenly emerge to compete for the financial market in Southeast Asia. If one wave is not yet smooth, another wave rises. The hard-won merger of several months will be in vain. The harm is small. As a result of internal conflict, both sides will be hurt, and foreigners will reap the benefits. The disaster is great. This is the first thing that must be properly planned between the domestic financial industry and the overseas Chinese financial industry. Secondly, if we believe that the financial business of Southeast Asia is promising, then we may as well buy the shares of the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, which is in the process of being organized. The face value of the shares is 40 yuan, but the current market price is only 20 yuan due to the financial downturn in Southeast Asia. Judging from its assets, it should be worth at least 30 yuan or more. In the future, when the market turns around, the property will appreciate, or the business will develop, it will be worth even more. Purchasing shares worth 30 yuan or more at a price of 20 yuan is a more simple and beneficial way to indirectly participate in the financial business of Southeast Asia than to establish a new business and open branches to engage directly. This purchase of shares directly provides assistance to the financial industry of Southeast Asia, indirectly encourages overseas Chinese, and greatly contributes to the revival of the overall economic power of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. This is the second thing that must be properly planned between domestic economic power and foreign economic power. If we can follow this path, the result of domestic and international cooperation will have a great effect on the development of the national economy. Some say that the development of domestic industry depends on foreign investment. Now, advocating investment overseas is not going against the trend? Regarding this point, we must recognize that first, the overseas Chinese economy and the domestic economy cannot be strongly separated. Whenever the Chinese people encounter incidents, they call on overseas Chinese for help, but they discriminate against the current economic panic of overseas Chinese, which is contradictory. Second, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia already have a solid economic foundation. At present, they have occasionally suffered setbacks. If we can give them a helping hand, the service of overseas Chinese to the motherland in the future may far exceed that of the past prosperous days. It is a light and easy task, and the effect is immeasurable. Third, I believe that it would be better to change our perspective and invest in the overseas Chinese business in Southeast Asia in order to achieve the result of internal and external cooperation, rather than making a superfluous effort to buy real estate, build buildings, and purchase foreign securities in domestic cities. I am not trying to abandon the domestic business of the Chinese people. Thinking of this, I suddenly thought of the domestic financial community, which also suffers from the shortcomings of sectarianism and weak capital. As a result of unnecessary competition, the domestic financial community reduces the benefits it deserves, and the external financial community cannot make sufficient contributions and assistance to the society and the country. If it can adapt to the trend and carry out mergers, the progress of the financial industry in the future is unlimited. The significance of this merger from a national economic point of view is far greater than the merger of the Chinese-owned banks in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The National Lawyers Association telegrams various lawyers associations: All national lawyers associations are informed that at the time of the provisional executive committee meeting of this Association held in Shanghai on the 13th of this month, it was generally agreed that the Northeastern Righteous Army is competing with stubborn enemies in the icy fields of the Northeast, with a determination to die in battle and a spirit of sacrifice, which is moving. It is not only the responsibility of the people of the Northeast but also the duty of the people of the whole country. The Central Government has been unable to provide sufficient relief due to various reasons.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Social Affairs Bureau and Others Release Statistics on Losses from the January 28th Incident <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, the losses suffered by our side in northern Shanghai were incalculable. At that time, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Accountants' Association, three organizations, formed the Shanghai War Loss Investigation Office to conduct a post-war loss investigation. Registration by households has now closed, and the office's loss statistics have also been completed. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency who inquired at the office, the number of damaged stores is certainly more than this, as some victims fled to other places or were too busy to register. Among the hundreds of thousands of disaster-stricken households in the war zone, only 26,251 registration forms were received. To better understand these losses, a second estimate is underway, hoping to obtain more detailed results. The loss statistics table for the January 28th Incident released by the office is transcribed below:</p>

<p>Amidst the snow and ice, with severed heads and pierced chests, falling one after another, washing away the shame of retreating without a fight, sustaining the nation's spirit, as fragile as a thread, with loyalty, courage, and unparalleled heroism, rarely seen in the world. Yet, because they are located in remote areas and at the height of severe winter, without warm clothing and with exhausted food supplies, they endure hunger and cold while facing the ugly threat of wolves and tigers, sacrificing blood and flesh to serve as a shield for the nation. Thinking of their extraordinary achievements, our shared hatred increases. Therefore, it was resolved to send a circular telegram to all member associations, first to solicit donations from their members, and then to contact all local groups to organize a support organization, and to attach copies of the Shanghai Bar Association's donation method and the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association's regulations for reference, etc. It is specially recorded and conveyed, hoping that the association will uphold its patriotic aspirations, actively support the volunteer army, and promptly report the details of how it is handled. We eagerly await your response. Respectfully, Liu Liumin, Jiang Yong, Yan Yinwu, Dai Tianqiu, and Liu Zhe, Standing Committee Members of the National Lawyers Association.</p>

<p>The yarn and cloth industry is reportedly being handled by Chairman Zhang Xizhai, who is responsible for soliciting monthly donations from various colleagues in the industry, to be handed over to the collecting bank each month.

<h3 id="e135">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance Requesting That the Export Tax on Northeastern Medicinal Materials Still Be Collected <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, greetings. On the 20th of this month, we received a letter from the Medicinal Materials Industry Association, stating that since the Northeastern customs were blockaded, the government has been levying taxes in other locations. Since the government does not recognize the abandonment of Northeastern territory, it naturally considers the products of that region to be domestic goods. If taxes are to be levied on goods transported from there to Shanghai, it would be fair to only supplement the Northeastern export tax. However, the customs now taxes Northeastern products transported to Shanghai as foreign goods, which is truly inappropriate. Northeastern production of medicinal materials is not small, and we should protest to the customs and request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward this to the Ministry of Finance to facilitate commercial transport.' Based on this, we have investigated that the Northeast is our country's territory, and the people there are naturally our country's people. The products of that region are the source of livelihood for the people there. If taxes are heavily levied, merchants will not be able to profit, and they will inevitably abandon it. How can the people there not worry about their livelihoods? The government values people's livelihood, and it will certainly not abandon the people of the Northeast. For the sake of the people of the Northeast and our country's commerce, we should carefully consider and handle it appropriately so that the people can prosper and the country can become rich. In our opinion, Northeastern products must not be taxed as foreign goods, and medicinal materials, in particular, are needed for people's health and should be subject to low taxes. In addition to protesting to the customs, we are sending this letter to request that your chamber of commerce forward it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting approval to tax Northeastern medicinal materials transported to Shanghai as domestic goods, and to order the customs to comply. Sincerely, etc.' Upon investigation, since the Northeastern customs declared a blockade and levied taxes in other locations, according to the original regulations, only transit taxes were collected on local goods transported from Andong, Niuzhuang, and other places to Shanghai. Only those transported from Dalian to Shanghai were subject to import taxes as foreign goods. Later, a sudden order changed the regulations, and all goods transported from Andong, Niuzhuang, and other places to Shanghai were also subject to import taxes. As a result, soybeans from Dong Province were subject to a tax of 10% ad valorem, sorghum from Niuzhuang was subject to a tax of 80% ad valorem, and cocoon silk from Andong was subject to a tax of 70% ad valorem, which is more than ten times the transit tax, which uses the old Xianfeng tax rates. Based on the request of the industry, the association has repeatedly telegraphed your ministry, requesting that taxes be levied according to the original regulations. More than a month has passed without a reply. The liquor industry, after paying the taxes, has no financial resources, and the increased costs will make it difficult to sell in Shanghai. If they are shelved, the customs will also have to impose fines according to the regulations. As a last resort, they have returned the original goods to Niuzhuang. The situation of other industries is roughly the same. Now, the medicinal materials industry has sent a letter with the same request. We should promptly order the customs to continue collecting transit taxes on local goods transported from Niuzhuang, Andong, and other places to Shanghai according to the original regulations. Otherwise, the lost territory of the Northeast will not be recovered, and the livelihood of the interior will be cut off first. Any planning for the country cannot be done in this way. We earnestly submit this, hoping that your ministry will review it and promptly approve it, which would be for the public good. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Elementary School Student Zhang Hengfu Zhang Hengfu, a grandson of Zhang Yunjii, a resident of No. 359 Gaun Road in the French Concession, is a 52-year-old Ningbo native who started his career in the hardware industry and accumulated considerable wealth, which made him a target for bandits. Zhang has an eight-year-old grandson named Hengfu, who attends a school on Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession. He goes to school every morning and returns after school in the afternoon, always transported by a dedicated rickshaw puller. This has become a daily routine.</p>
<p>Five or Six Bandits Arrive At around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, rickshaw puller Mao Xiaotao went to pick up Hengfu as usual. Unexpectedly, when he reached No. 353 Gaun Road, only a few steps away from home, five or six bandits suddenly rushed out from the roadside. All the bandits were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, and their ages were all around thirty. Two of them pulled out pistols to stop the rickshaw puller from advancing.</p>
<p>Taking the Hostage into the Car At the same time, the remaining bandits swarmed forward and beat rickshaw puller Mao Xiaotao. Three bandits took the opportunity to snatch Hengfu from the rickshaw, dragged him into a car parked by the roadside, and one bandit started the engine and drove the car north at high speed. Mao Xiaotao witnessed his young master being kidnapped and bravely chased and shouted for help. The bandits' car turned into Fuli Road, intending to flee east.</p>
<p>Two Police Intercept the Bandits' Car The area was remote, and Mao Xiaotao's shouts for help alarmed the neighborhood. Two Chinese police officers, No. 367 and No. 392, happened to be stationed on Fuli Road and intercepted the bandits' car head-on. However, due to the disparity in numbers, only two bandits were captured. The remaining bandits escaped. The hostage, Zhang Hengfu, was still sitting in the car, but his face was ashen and he was petrified.</p>
<p>License Plate Numbers Were Forged At the same time, Supervisor Jin Jiulin, Detective Li Yaolong, Zhang Ziying, Detective Qin Youyu, Zhang Daorong, Zhang Chunsheng, and others from the special agency of the French Concession police station also heard the alarm and drove to search. They then assisted the two Chinese police officers, No. 367 and No. 392, in taking the bandits' car to the police station along with the arrested bandits. After inspecting the car, it was found that the license plate number 1459 was forged. The real license plate numbers were No. 1092 in the French Concession and No. 9495 in the British Concession.</p>
<p>Two Bandits Confess to Kidnapping The two bandits arrested on the spot were interrogated by the police chief. One bandit, the driver, confessed his name was Yu Haitao, 25 years old, from Tongzhou, residing at No. 340 Huishan Lane, Huishan Road. The other, Lu Heshang, 27 years old, from Tongzhou, residing in a bungalow on Wuzhen Road in Zhabei, worked as a pushcart operator. They directly admitted to gathering people to carry out the kidnapping. Afterwards, Zhao Lianfu (62 years old, from Tongzhou), the owner of the car, was brought from Huishan Lane, but it was heard that he was not involved in the case. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately, pending referral to the court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Abandoning Textbooks, Yun Huifang Willing to Go Through the Pass</p>
<h3 id="e139">Request to Join the Volunteer Army Rescue Team <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yun Huifang, the young patriot who used a bomb to warn treacherous merchants, recently, in view of the fact that winter is approaching, animals are hibernating, and the Northeastern Volunteer Army is still fighting against Japan to the death in the snowy and icy land, and the rescue work is urgent, she is willing to abandon her textbook life and go to the Guanwai (area beyond the Great Wall) to implement the rescue work. Therefore, at 1:00 PM yesterday, she went to the office of the Northeastern Volunteer Army Rescue Team in Xiaonanmen Sanmei Temple and requested to join. The team's communication officer, Song Guoguang, received her and told her that the Northeast is a battlefield of artillery fire, and rescue work requires considerable experience and knowledge to be competent, and that she is currently studying hard at Junyi Middle School. The review of the third batch of team members has been completed, and the fourth batch has not yet begun. If there is an opportunity, she will be notified. Yun left her contact information and departed.</p>
<p>Rescue Team Selects Supervisors The Northeastern Volunteer Army Rescue Team yesterday selected Hong Ludong, Lu Jingshi, and Zhu Xuefei as supervisors, Pan Yunchao, Jiang Bocheng, Qi Xuezheng, Ouyang Huizhen, Ge Zhaoji, Liu Youzhong, Sun Kejin, Hong Xiheng, Zhou Lianze, Xu Huiyi, Yang Peiwen, and Yu Yaoqiu as design committee members, and Wu Kaisheng, Wu Youyuan, Yuan Yangan, Pan Zhe, Chen Yufei, Fan Mingnong, Gu Changyuan, Gu Nanqun, and Jin Yanyuan as consultants. Notices have been sent to each, requesting them to take office on a specific date.</p>
<p>Reception Center Donates Woolen Blankets The Jing'an Temple War Zone Disaster Relief Center, considering that the Northeast is bitterly cold and the volunteer army's clothing is thin, yet they are bravely fighting the enemy in the icy and snowy land, their loyalty and courage are commendable and their situation is dire, sent 140 surplus unused woolen blankets donated by various sectors during the January 28th Incident to the Volunteer Army Support Association for forwarding to the front lines.</p>
<h3 id="e140">From the Juelu Hotel to the Yipinxiang <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>▲ A Thief in the Military World, Quite Skilled</p>
<p>▲ Dancer's Coat Not Yet in Hand</p>
<p>▲ Rickshaw Puller and Doorman All Shouted Loudly</p>
<p>▲ Chen Yi Cleverly Arrested in the End</p>
<p>Chen Yi, from Changsha, Hunan, used to work in the military but is now unemployed. Due to economic pressure, he took the risk of engaging in petty theft. Chen usually dresses fashionably and stays in rooms at major hotels, paying attention to the comings and goings of guests. When the opportunity arises, he steals clothing and other items from the rooms of guests who are out. Because of his quick actions, he has never been caught. A few days ago, Chen went to the Juelu Hotel on Xizang Road and opened room number 66. The balcony of that room was connected to room number 17 of the neighboring Yipinxiang Hotel, separated only by an iron railing. One morning at one o'clock, Wang Suzhen (17 years old), a local woman who was a dancer at the Da Hu Dance Hall, and a dance partner Guan Shi were staying in room number 17 of the Yipinxiang Hotel. At five o'clock in the morning, they went out together, leaving a coat in the room. Chen saw this and climbed over the iron railing, entered room number 17, stole the coat, and climbed back over the railing, preparing to return to his room. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw puller Zhang and the doorman of the Yipinxiang Hotel saw him and shouted loudly. Chen panicked and threw the coat into room number 64, trying to evade responsibility. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the Laoza police station, which ordered detective Chen Yonggui to come and arrest Chen. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the first criminal court of the First Special District Court. Police station lawyer Ru Baoqi requested a postponement because the defendant had committed multiple offenses, which had not yet been clarified. Presiding Judge Feng questioned Wang Suzhen and Chen Yi and ordered Chen to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<p>The Banking Industry's Statement on the Shipment of Silver Dollars to the Northeast</p>
<h3 id="e141">Entirely for Commercial Relations <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a large amount of silver dollars has been shipped from Shanghai to the Northeast, totaling more than 8 million yuan in two weeks. This has attracted social attention. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed a leader in the banking industry yesterday to inquire about his opinion on this matter. According to him, the shipment of silver dollars to the Northeast is entirely for commercial relations. From the perspective of the banking industry, various banks in the city have branches in the Northeast. The people of the Northeast usually trust the exchange notes issued by the banks. Since the establishment of the puppet state, the Japanese have implemented an aggressive policy, hoping to monopolize the economy and force the people of the Northeast to use Japanese banknotes. However, the people still prefer to use Chinese banknotes. However, the banks must have sufficient reserves for redemption to prevent emergencies. In addition, now is the time when soybeans in the Northeast are being exported, and cash is also needed. In addition, there are many other telegraphic transfers to the Northeast, so it is necessary to ship silver dollars for adjustment. In short, the financial community firmly believes that the shipment of silver dollars has absolutely no other relations.</p>
<p>Songjiang Natives in Shanghai Appeal for the Songjiang Newspaper</p>
<h3 id="e142">Telegram from Song Bao Seeking Assistance <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Songjiang Song Bao newspaper, due to publishing news about the Anti-Japanese Association's inspection of goods, was deemed by the Party Headquarters to have violated Party orders and was ordered to cease publication. Songjiang natives residing in Shanghai yesterday sent a joint telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Political Affairs Office, requesting rectification to uphold public opinion. The original telegram is recorded below: "On the 20th of this month, the Songjiang Anti-Japanese Association inspected enemy goods and distributed leaflets, creating a commotion that led to conflict. Yuanda &amp; Co. closed its business on the same day, and the citizens were in a state of unrest. The news spread to Songjiang and Shanghai, and the facts are clear. However, the Songjiang County Party Headquarters, because the Song Bao published news about the Anti-Japanese Association's inspection of goods on the 21st of this month, deemed it a violation of central secret orders and sent a letter to the county government ordering it to cease publication. This is deeply shocking. We have always lacked sound public opinion in Songjiang. Since its publication, the newspaper has maintained a position that is barely satisfactory. However, it has been envied by powerful figures because it advocates fairness. This time, the publication of the above news was based on facts. Even if there were errors, according to the regulations for inspecting propaganda, it should be corrected or reprimanded. However, the Party Headquarters does not interfere with the Anti-Japanese Association's distribution of leaflets, but considers the newspaper's reporting a violation of Party orders and orders it to cease publication. This cannot help but be suspected of stifling public opinion. In order to protect public opinion, the central government has clear stipulations. As leaders of the people, Party Headquarters should not abuse their power or act impulsively. Fellow Songjiang natives residing in Shanghai feel a deep connection to their hometown and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we respectfully request that your departments and offices quickly rectify this situation in order to uphold public opinion. This is for the public good." Respectfully, Zhou Bingjun, Qu Guannan, Yu Wenwu, Zhu Mengwei, Gao Xiaohong, Zhou Yuwen, Luo Shizhen, Wang Cengzhi, Li Xingcheng, and others from the Songjiang Public Association in Shanghai kowtow.</p>
<p>The Song Bao telegram states: "To all newspaper offices and news agencies nationwide, please be advised that since our newspaper began publication last year, we have earned the false praise of society and incurred the jealousy of those in power due to our independent stance and impartial commentary. We have been slandered and harmed numerous times. This time, the Songjiang County Party Headquarters, using the excuse of Party orders, ordered our newspaper to cease publication on the 22nd of this month. Under such oppressive power, where is there justice? Our newspaper is now sending a telegram to the province requesting relief. We hereby send this telegram to all fellow countrymen, hoping for your assistance. It would be fortunate for our newspaper and fortunate for the world of public opinion. All members of the Songjiang Song Bao kowtow."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Cai Wuji, Director of the Product Collection Office for the Chicago Exposition Preparatory Committee, Returns to Shanghai <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and concurrently Director of the Product Collection Office for the Chicago Exposition, went north on October 26 for matters related to product collection. He stayed in Tianjin for three days, discussing product selection with the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau and other organizations. It was decided that coarse and fine furs, dried and fresh fruits, and specialty products from Hebei Province would be collected by the Tianjin Inspection Bureau and other agencies. On the 2nd, he traveled from Tianjin to Beiping, where he held discussions with Mayor Zhou Da-wen, Director Wang Shen of the Public Works Bureau, Director Cai Yuan of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Leng Jiaji of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce, and others regarding the purpose of the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition, the significance of China's decision to participate, the progress of preparations, the situation of product collection, and his hopes for this trip to the north. Mayor Zhou and others immediately expressed their enthusiasm and support. The next day, at the Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Leng invited representatives from forty industries, including carpets, cloisonné, and lacquer carving, to discuss the matter of Beiping products participating in the exposition. Fearing that the merchants were stuck in their old ways of thinking and did not understand the truth, Cai repeatedly stated that the association would be responsible for compensating for any damage or loss of products. The representatives agreed to select their best products and concentrate them at the Chamber of Commerce in mid-December for shipment to Shanghai. Cai also believed that this Chicago Exposition valued drama, so he made a special trip to Daren Hutong to visit Mei Lanfang. They talked for a long time about the participation of dramatic performances in the exposition. Mei was also very interested in being invited to North America again. At noon on the 14th, at the invitation of Mayor Zhou, he again consulted with Mei Lanfang, Qi Rushan, and others, and they felt that there were economic difficulties. Finally, Mei agreed to further plan for funding when he came to Shanghai at the beginning of next month. The preliminary work for industrial, artistic, dramatic, and scientific products from various places in Beiping and Tianjin has been completed, and Cai has returned to Shanghai in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Labor Dispute at China General Edison Company Yesterday <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>▲Both Parties Willing to Resolve the Issue Themselves Outside</p>
<p>▲If There is No Result, Mediation Will Be Held Again on the 28th</p>
<p>After the workers of China General Edison Company resumed work, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated the dispute at 10:00 AM yesterday. The company requested a postponement because Chairman Wang Yiting was in Luoyang. After persuasion, the mediation was officially held at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Labor representatives Fu Chongde and Hu Yida, capital representatives Zhang Xiaoliang and Gu Qingyi, Zhou Lianze, the Chief of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Jin Zhongjian, a staff member of the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau, attended, and Wang Gang, a staff member of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided over the meeting. Jiang Baofu was the recorder. Zhu Xuefan and Li Yongxiang from the General Labor Union, Lu Bohong, the manager of the company, and Tan Honglin and Zhang Zhendong from the labor union were also present. First, the chairman reported on the handling of the case. Then, the labor representatives stated the reasons for their four standard demands (see previous report for details): (1) Why are workers not given wage increases when employees are given wage increases? (2) Employees have better treatment and higher wages than workers. (3) The company has had profits in previous years, so increasing wages would not have an impact. (4) If business suffers losses and employees' salaries are reduced, the workers are also willing to reduce their wages. Then, the capital representatives stated that there are 218 workers with wages above 40 yuan and 538 workers with wages below 40 yuan. If the workers' proposed standards are followed, the company's expenses would increase by more than 100,000 yuan per year, which is impossible to accept. The reasons are: (1) across-the-board wage increases are a bad precedent; (2) the demands are extravagant; (3) the reasons are insufficient; (4) the net profit has already been distributed; (5) prices are falling. After repeated persuasion by the chairman, two methods of increasing wages were proposed: (1) for those with a monthly wage above 40 yuan, and (2) for those with a monthly wage below 40 yuan. The labor representatives made a concession, proposing an across-the-board increase of 8 yuan for workers with wages below 40 yuan and 7 yuan for those with wages above 40 yuan. The capital representatives stated that the time for this mediation was limited and that they did not have time to hold a board meeting. A decision could only be made after the board of directors discussed the matter. As a result, for the sake of cooperation, both labor and capital voluntarily agreed to try to resolve the issue themselves outside. The chairman approved the self-resolution and scheduled another mediation for the 28th. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Extension of Railway Coal Transportation Price Increase Continues for Three Months <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Regarding railway transportation prices for coal and coke, the National Mining Federation has repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Railways to reduce prices to lower costs and prevent the dumping of foreign coal. The Ministry of Railways believes that the high cost of domestic coal is due to other reasons, and the level of transportation fees has little impact. Furthermore, the cost of railways is also crucial, and no further reductions can be allowed. However, in order to promote production and sales, the case of suspending the price increase has been extended repeatedly. Now, the third extension is due to expire on the 20th of this month. The Shanghai Coal Industry Association has specifically petitioned the Ministry of Railways to continue reducing the railway transportation price of domestic coal by 20% in order to prevent dumping and provide relief. Yesterday, a reply was received from the Ministry of Railways, extending the period by another three months. The original approval stated: "We have received your report. In order to consider the difficulties of merchants and encourage the production and sales of domestic coal, this Ministry has issued a notice to all railways to extend the suspension of the price increase for coal and coke transportation by another three months. In addition to separate orders, this approval is hereby issued for your information."</p>
<h3 id="e146">Citizens on Nanjing Road Refute Shanghai Municipal Council's Telephone Price Increase <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, believing that the residents within the concession are misunderstanding the telephone price increase, published an article in various newspapers on November 18 to defend the company. Now, it is learned that the Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Citizens' Association have published an article yesterday to refute it. The original text states: "Having read the section on the telephone price increase published by the Municipal Council in the newspaper on the 18th of this month, much of it represents what the telephone company has said or wants to say. This one-sided view is difficult to convince. We hereby refute it as follows: (1) The statements 'the company has not paid dividends since its establishment,' 'although prices have been increased, it is still losing money,' and 'various losses' all belong to the company's own policy of improving services to society and developing its foundation, which users are not responsible for. If one insists on quickly making a profit and recouping investment within 'a period of 26 months' to make a profit, it is not something a public transportation telephone company can dream of. Spring planting and autumn harvest are natural. To sow in the spring and want to harvest in the summer is to blame the sower for being too anxious, not to blame the land for being infertile. The meaning of the fourth paragraph is roughly: 'From August 5, 1930, when the company was established, to the end of September of this year, a total loss of 218,432 taels was incurred over a period of 26 months.' Even in terms of the 26 months of losses, it is natural that the Shanghai Telephone Company has suffered losses due to its efforts to expand its lines to more than four times their original size. This cannot be used as a sufficient reason for a large price increase and retroactive compensation for the new price. Now, the company wants to recover huge sums of money in a short period of time and wants the current 30,000 users to bear the burden of the equipment for 100,000 users in the future (the company also admits this in its reply). This is truly a manifestation of the company owner's excessive greed and is illogical. (2) Regarding the price increase in the 1929 Anthon report, according to his statement, he admitted his mistake, so it has lost its basis. If Anthon were to come to Shanghai again to investigate the recent situation, he would probably also think that such a large increase should not be made suddenly. The above two points are only the most important ones. In short, the Municipal Council is the municipal organ of the Public Concession and should clarify its position and take fair measures. It must not use the arguments of a commercial telephone company as its own words as a municipal authority. This association, as a group of citizens and merchants who pay huge taxes within the concession, has the responsibility to convey public opinion. We hereby offer our advice again, hoping that the municipal authorities within the concession will eliminate prejudices and resolve the opposition to the telephone price increase well to avoid the worsening of social disputes," and so on.</p>
<p>The City's Financial Situation This Year</p>
<h3 id="e147">Deficit Exceeds 500,000 Yuan <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Since the war, Shanghai's financial revenue has decreased, and expenditures have increased sharply due to post-war expenses. The difficult situation has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, reliable information from the Finance Bureau stated that at the end of last year, the city treasury had already incurred a deficit of more than 1.1 million yuan. The deficit is even more severe today. From July to October of the 21st year, the total revenue was about 2.7 million yuan, and the total expenditure for various expenses was about 3.2 million yuan. The difference results in a deficit of more than 500,000 yuan. As a result, various methods are being tried to raise funds, and the officials are busy coping with the situation all day long. Even if the future reconstruction public bond is successful, it is all designated for reconstruction in the disaster areas and cannot be diverted. The only plan for now is to live within our means and strive for austerity. It is estimated that even with efforts to collect taxes, the actual revenue in the tax collection area will average about 600,000 yuan per month. It is already difficult to cover the monthly recurring expenses (such as the recurring expenses of various agencies, various coordination fees, and the municipal bond fund), which are all essential expenditures. Therefore, the only way to cope is to implement the principle of using current revenue to cover current expenses in order to barely maintain the current situation. The city treasury deficit will have to be made up after the central government approves the implementation of land tax collection.</p>

<p>Since Director Jiang took office, the Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau has spared no effort in rectifying affairs. Regarding the tax payments due from its subordinate bureaus each month, notices and telegrams have been sent back and forth, and staff have been repeatedly dispatched to collect them. Many bureaus have made payments on schedule, but there are also some that have been negligent and in arrears. It is reported that the Wujin and Dajia local tax bureaus have been dismissed one after another due to unpaid tax payments for several months. It is also said that other bureaus are being strictly urged to pay. If they continue to delay, they will also be replaced as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Second Trial of the Anhui Relief Dispute Case Today <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The case of the dispute over relief work in northern Anhui was heard on the 22nd of the month. Due to time constraints, only the first defendant, Yang Shucheng, was interrogated. Yang stated that the plaintiff did not understand the powers, responsibilities, and organization of the flood relief committee, and thus reversed right and wrong. At the court hearing, Mr. Baker, the head of the transportation department of the flood relief committee, who was fully responsible for transportation, proved everything. It is reported that Yang will also file a counterclaim. The case is scheduled for a second hearing today (the 25th). Quan Shaowu, the second defendant in the case, sent a special telegram to Xu Shiying, inviting him to come to Shanghai to attend the hearing. The original telegram is recorded below: "To Mr. Xu Jingren of Qiupu, esteemed Sir: The case of the Anhui relief dispute is a false accusation, and a counterclaim has been filed and accepted by the court. The remarks made by the legal representative of the Anhui Fellow Association yesterday in Shanghai were mostly distorted facts, deliberately sensationalized, and protective. He even threatened with the words that representatives of the people of Anhui will come to Shanghai to petition. Therefore, the judge then stated that lawsuits must be based on facts. In today's society, the decline of morality and the hearts of people is purely due to the obscurity of right and wrong and the confusion of black and white. The way to remedy this is to focus on the facts. A small number of so-called disaster area representatives in northern Anhui have been disrupting relief work since April of this year, with ulterior motives. The process was presented to you in person in Shanghai during the summer. Now, on the occasion of mourning just completed and reading rituals at home, it is with great apology that I disturb your attention again. However, considering that you are the chief representative of the Anhui Fellow Association and a standing committee member of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, I respectfully request that you attend the court to uphold justice and clarify the facts. Then, one word from you will be decisive, the dispute can be resolved immediately, right and wrong can be revealed, and the hearts of society and the future of relief work will be deeply dependent. I await your arrival and look forward to your reply. Quan Shaowu bows respectfully."</p>

<p>▲Highway Conference to be Held in Nanjing</p>
<p>▲Shanghai has Sent Tan Boying as a Committee Member</p>
<p>For the purpose of developing highways, the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai jointly initiated the establishment of a traffic committee for the mutual connection of automobiles in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Six organizations, including the National Economic Society, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Anhui Provincial Government, the Nanjing Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, are responsible for the project. The Shanghai Municipal Government has appointed Tan Boying, the Chief of the Fourth Section of the Public Utilities Bureau, as a committee member to attend the meeting. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specifically inquired with Mr. Tan Boying, who said that the matter is still in progress and that committee members have not yet been appointed everywhere. Only this city has appointed him as a committee member.

<h3 id="e153">Chairman Lin Sends Letter of Encouragement <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The painter Chen Tianxiao, who is skilled in the six methods of painting, has a long-standing reputation. He does not adhere to ancient methods but develops his personality, expressing complexity with simplicity, using a powerful brush, and especially excelling at ink blending. He is not afraid of turbidity in thick ink and is not afraid of dryness in light ink. His few strokes are naturally unrestrained. He is truly a famous work of the modern freehand school. Recently, Mr. Chen, feeling the urgency of the national crisis and lamenting the suffering of the northeastern compatriots, is holding a personal exhibition on the national crisis, selling tickets to help the northeastern refugees. It is scheduled to be held for three days, the 26th, 27th, and 28th, at the Ningbo Fellow Association. It is reported that Mr. Chen recently went to the capital to sketch for the exhibition. Important figures from the central government praised Mr. Chen's works for their powerful style and vigor, calling them rare in modern times. Chen Guofu, Chen Shuren, Zhu Jiahua, Shao Yuanchong, Chu Minyi, Wu Zhihui, Xiao Jishan, Wang Qi, Huang Jichen, Shi Ying, Zhang Renjie, and Hong Ludong all personally inscribed plaques to commend and praise him. They also selected and collected paintings from Mr. Chen. Chairman Lin of the National Government sent a letter to Mr. Chen, highly commending him, which is a precedent for Chinese artists receiving preferential treatment from the government and is especially honorable. The letter is recorded in brief below: "Mr. Tianxiao, your selling of paintings to help disaster relief is a manifestation of benevolence and grace, and I greatly admire you. Your mastery of the six methods is excellent and has a long-standing reputation. Bringing harmony to disaster will further enhance your reputation and secure a seat in the art world," and so on. He also plans to personally inscribe a plaque and select paintings from Mr. Chen. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai and other celebrities also praise Mr. Chen's works for being extraordinary and exquisite in brush and ink and are competing to order many paintings from him. At the opening, there will be a unique scene.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Ministry of Industry Replies to the Road Association's Letter <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association sent a letter to the Ministry of Industry requesting the notification of provinces and cities to promote the imitation of automobiles and the development of petroleum. A reply has been received, informing that an automobile factory is being planned with the Ford Motor Company, and petroleum is also being planned for extraction. The Minsheng Factory, which was originally the Liaoning Mortar Factory, has been moved to Tianjin to continue operations. The original letter is as follows: "Gentlemen, We have received your letter requesting the notification of provinces and cities to promote the imitation of automobiles and the development of petroleum. We greatly admire your insights. The establishment of automobile factories and the extraction of petroleum mines are all urgent matters that should be planned and prepared. However, due to the lack of raw materials, economic resources, and talent, we have not been able to implement them. We are currently in discussions with representatives of the Ford Motor Company of the United States to first establish an automobile assembly plant. Once a plan is agreed upon, it can be realized. In the future, we plan to gradually establish manufacturing plants and promote them in various places. The extraction of petroleum is also being planned. Furthermore, the Minsheng Factory, which was originally affiliated with the Liaoning Mortar Factory, has now been moved to Tianjin and renamed the Beiyang Machinery Factory to continue operations. Last month, we received a request to forward a report to the Ministry of Finance to exempt the imported materials from taxes, which has been forwarded accordingly. The above is the reply to your letter. Please be advised. Minister Chen Gongbo."</p>

<p>Since the beginning of winter, Shanghai has experienced two periods of severe cold, with the temperature on the Fahrenheit thermometer dropping close to zero. Unexpectedly, the weather suddenly turned warm in the past two days, especially yesterday, with the temperature rising to 72 degrees.

<p>For the Families of the Victims of the Jin Shunxing Shipwreck</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yushun ship collided with the fishing boat Jin Shunxing in the Shantou waters, drowning eight people. Nineteen people were rescued, and the losses were worth tens of thousands of gold. The families of the victims have nowhere to turn. Now, the shipowner and the families of the victims have come to Shanghai, requesting assistance from all sectors of society. The Southern Fujian Fellow Association in Shanghai has convened a meeting and sent a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting them to consider the losses of the sunken fishing boat and provide generous compensation to the families of the deceased to comfort the spirits.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Maru Collides with a Yellow Sand Ship</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Association Submits a Report to the Shipping Office to Order Compensation <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The boat owned by Lu Zhenxing of the Lu Yu Ji Sand and Gravel Transportation Company in this city, loaded with 50 tons of yellow sand, was sailing past the Changqi Wharf at about 7:00 AM yesterday when the Japanese-owned Dalian Kisen Kaisha's Tianjin Maru was entering the port. The bow of the ship was heading diagonally toward Pudong and speeding, intending to turn around and dock at the Huangpu Wharf on the Puxi side. Therefore, it blocked the Huangpu River and proceeded directly towards Pudong. It did not blow a horn and continued to speed recklessly, disregarding the danger. At this time, it was high tide, so the yellow sand boat could not avoid it and was violently hit by the ship. The ship and cargo sank completely, and the workers on board fell into the water at the same time. Fortunately, they were rescued by the water patrol. The losses were huge. In addition to reporting to the water patrol station, a report was submitted to the Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association, requesting a report to the Shipping Office of the Customs to order compensation. It is reported that the association will send personnel to negotiate with the Dalian Kisen Kaisha today, demanding compensation for all losses.</p>
<p>Public Concession Detectives Illegally Search the Hongshun Mutual Aid Association</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Taxpayer Association Sends a Letter to the Municipal Council Requesting Investigation <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday stating that they had received a letter from the Shanghai Hongshun Mutual Aid Association, which stated that at 3:50 PM on the 12th of this month, a person claiming to be detective Feng Xueze, accompanied by a Westerner who looked like a public official and a Chinese person in plain clothes, carrying pistols, escorted two women to the association's office in Yongxiang Lane at the intersection of Donghan Laili Road and Zhoujiazui Road to conduct a search. When asked about the reason for the search and whether they had a court warrant, they did not answer. The association's staff members realized that they could not reason with them and could not resist, so they had to let them do as they pleased. However, they searched up and down without finding anything and then left. Afterwards, the association sent personnel to the Jiuxing Road Police Station to inquire about the matter, and it was stated that no one had been sent to conduct a search. They also asked the police station to call the Hongkou Police Station to inquire, but they also said that they knew nothing about it. Upon learning this, they were extremely shocked. However, for the sake of caution, at 10:00 PM that night, they sent personnel to the Hongkou Police Station to inquire and happened to see a Westerner sitting there who seemed to be the one who had come to the association to conduct the search during the day. When asked, he admitted it, but he was vague about the reason for the search and whether he was acting under orders. The association has been registered with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Party Headquarters as a formal charitable organization. They have been subjected to such illegal violations for no reason. Where is the so-called legal protection for residents, public, and private organizations in the concession? Even according to the regulations of the Police Department, if a search is necessary, the police station should first request a search warrant from the competent court or show the warrant with a bailiff before entering the room to execute the search. Even in the case of a person caught in the act or an emergency, the reasons must be explained. It is absolutely forbidden to do so arbitrarily without reason. The people who came did not have badges, did not state the reasons, and did not follow the regulations. They illegally entered the association's office to conduct a search. Fortunately, the staff members were patient. Otherwise, if they had resisted according to the law, the consequences would have been unimaginable. In such a situation, not only the reputation and legal interests of the association are at stake, but the contempt for legal authority and the infringement of the people's peaceful residence cannot be tolerated. If this practice is allowed to continue, the consequences will be endless. The association has no choice but to report the situation.</p>
<p>We should request that the association seriously negotiate with the Municipal Council to ensure that the detectives apologize in the newspaper and guarantee that the same situation will not happen again in the future. This will not only benefit the association but also allow all residents of the concession to live in peace and avoid harassment.</p>
<h3 id="e159">More Than Two Thousand Shanties in Pudong Plead <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>▲Telegraphic Request to Chairman Chiang for Relief</p>
<p>▲Separate Telegrams to the Central National Government for Negotiation</p>
<p>Representatives of shanties along Liaoyang Road in Yangshupu Road, Pudong, yesterday telegraphed Chairman Chiang in Hankou, the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying: "The shanty dwellers in Yangshupu, Shanghai, are all famine refugees making a living as coolies. Recently, the Public Works Department, under the pretext of not being registered, sent people to forcibly demolish [the shanties] and destroy furniture, leaving the people with no place to live, inevitably forcing them to take risks, affecting public order. After repeated negotiations by the Shanghai Party and government and various organizations, there has been no effect. We hereby telegraphically request that you promptly forward [this matter] to the Shanghai authorities and negotiate with the Public Works Department to restore the demolished shanties to their original state, and that those not yet demolished must not be demolished again. The telegraph is urgently awaiting your command." Teng Xuehong and others, representatives of more than two thousand four hundred shanty households in Pudong, bow their heads.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Autopsy Report on Yao Xiaoji, Kicked to Death by Koreans <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Koreans Li Changlian and Gui Xichang previously caused a dispute at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Oujia Road when buying baked sweet potatoes from an elderly woman, Yao Chen, from Changshu. They kicked her two sons, Yao Meimei and Yao Xiaoji, in the abdomen, sending them to Tongren Hospital. Subsequently, Yao Xiaoji died from his injuries. The Public Security Bureau sent a letter to the District Court, requesting that Prosecutor Yang Qi be appointed to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that Yao Xiaoji died from being kicked in the lower abdomen. However, Dr. Tenggong of the Fukumin Hospital, appointed by the Japanese consulate, refused to participate in the autopsy, claiming that Yao Xiaoji's abdomen had already been dissected, making it impossible to determine the cause of death. Therefore, the Japanese consulate did not punish the two Koreans. The deceased, Yao Xiaoji, was unable to clear his grievances. After Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying of the District Court carefully reviewed the case file, he decided to send a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that Yao Xiaoji's coffin be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for a detailed autopsy. At nine o'clock the morning before yesterday, the institute opened Yao Xiaoji's coffin and dissected the body in detail. The autopsy was completed yesterday, but the determination of death caused by kicking still requires pathological tissue and microscopic examination. After all examinations are completed, an appraisal report will be compiled and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for forwarding to the Japanese consulate for negotiation. Yesterday, the coffin was returned to the Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District for safekeeping, and a letter was sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for reference.</p>

<p>After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Tongde Medical College was the first to organize a rescue team to serve on the battlefield, making great contributions. Later, it was reorganized into the Seventh Red Cross Rescue Team. Liu Qiduan was an outstanding talent of the school, studying for four years and always ranking at the top of his class. Teachers valued him more and more. Liu was enthusiastic about patriotism and would not let others go first. After joining the rescue team, he worked very actively. His spirit of disregard for his own safety was truly admirable. One day, when he went to Zhabei, he heard frontline soldiers say that there were wounded soldiers of our army near the Commercial Press who had been injured for three days and had not been rescued. Liu volunteered to advance at risk, but was suddenly sniped by enemy sentries and died in Baolong Hospital, sacrificing his life for the country. Though dead, he lives on. It is reported that in addition to submitting a request to the central government for commendation, the school will also hold a memorial service for Martyr Liu at 3:00 PM on the 26th of this month, inviting people from all walks of life to participate. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time. It is also learned that the school will write a biography and erect a monument for the martyr to commemorate him forever.</p>

<p>The Qingpu-Shanghai Highway is the only major transportation route connecting Qingpu County and Shanghai City, with a total length of approximately 22 kilometers. About half a kilometer of it is within the territory of this city. It is now reported that the road construction project within Qingpu County is currently being bid on and started by the Qingpu County Construction Bureau. As for the part within this city, it is reported that the Municipal Government considers that if the construction of the section within this city is not carried out simultaneously, the project will inevitably lose its effectiveness when the county completes the construction. Therefore, it has ordered the Public Works Bureau to include this project as one of the Reconstruction Trunk Road projects and to actively build it as soon as the Reconstruction Public Bond funds are available. As for the matters concerning the acquisition of land, the Land Bureau has been ordered to prepare in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Actor Sentenced for Smoking Opium <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Li Xinpei, a famous actor from Tianjin, also known as Li Liqing, has been performing as an old male role at the Tianchan Stage. At 8:30 PM the day before yesterday, his residence at No. 307, Huile Lane, Yunnan Road, was suddenly searched by Chinese detectives Song Bingzheng and Chen Yaoting from the Narcotics Department of the Public Concession Police, acting on a search warrant from the First Special District Court. At that time, Li was lying on a couch, smoking opium. He was immediately arrested by the detectives. At the same time, Shanghai women Yang Gendi (17 years old) and Li Suzhen (18 years old) were also in the house and were also arrested. It was found that the women seemed to be prostitutes, but they denied it at the police station. At that time, an opium pipe, two lamps, two bowls, twelve and a half taels of opium, and an opium ledger were seized and taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division 1. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted Li for providing premises for opium smoking under Article 10 of the Anti-Opium Law and for smoking opium under Article 11. The two women were prosecuted under Article 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. Subsequently, Western Inspector Bai Po submitted a report on the circumstances of the search, stating that when they entered the house, Li Liqing and Li Suzhen were sleeping in the same bed, with an opium pipe placed beside each of them. Yang was sitting on a stool. When Li saw them arrive, he threw two opium pipes out of the window. After they went to find the pipes, they had already been picked up by someone. Only two broken bowls were recovered. One of the pipes presented to the court today was found elsewhere. Li Xinpei confessed that the opium paraphernalia were relics left by his late father, and he sometimes used them when he had a heart attack, and he did not run an opium den. The two women were his students learning opera. The two women confessed that they were learning opera at Li's place and did not go there to smoke opium. Li hired lawyer Zheng Wenkai to defend him. Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court reviewed the confession and sentenced Li Liqing to one month's imprisonment and a fine of 120 yuan, with a bail of 500 yuan during the appeal period. The two women were acquitted, and the opium paraphernalia were confiscated.</p>
<p>Yang Shengyuan Acquitted</p>
<h3 id="e166">Wu Yinting's Lawsuit Rejected <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Ford Tobacco Company previously entered into a contract with the Gongxing Tobacco Stack in Hangzhou to promote "Lion Cat" cigarettes, stating that mildewed cigarettes should be exchanged, and each empty pack could be exchanged for one cigarette. Gongxing sold over 800 boxes of the brand, receiving gifts and exchanging mildewed cigarettes worth approximately 30,000 yuan. Because Ford refused to pay, Gongxing deducted the amount from the cigarette price of 41,000 yuan. The Ford manager, Wu Yinting, suddenly lured Yang Shengyuan, the manager of Gongxing, to Shanghai on the pretext of inviting him to join Ford as a shareholder. On one hand, he reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station, falsely claiming that Gongxing had ceased operations and that Yang Shengyuan had defrauded him of the cigarettes. The police sent detectives to detain Yang and escort him to the First Special District Court, where he was granted bail pending trial. Later, Wu reported to the police, claiming that Yang had falsely used Ford's name to open a current account at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank to obtain illegal benefits. At a subsequent hearing, Yang's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, explained that the reason for opening a current account at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank was to use public bonds as collateral, and the funds were purely for Ford's use. Later, because Wu Yinting did not submit the accounts for inspection, Yang refused to join as a shareholder, and the current account was abandoned. He also presented letters from the Hangzhou Tobacco Industry Association and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, proving that the Gongxing Tobacco Stack had never closed down and that Wu Yinting had completely fabricated the facts. The court realized that the plaintiff had indeed made false accusations. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang opened the court and announced that Yang Shengyuan was not guilty and dismissed the plaintiff's incidental civil lawsuit.</p>

<p>On May 26th of this year, at the home of Cai Dianwu, a farmer in the northern countryside of Huaian County, bandits named Cai Dianzu and Cai Dianfu, etc., went to rob him of 1,020 silver dollars and clothing. Before leaving, the bandits also kidnapped a total of six people, including Cai Dianwu's wife and children. After repeatedly extorting large sums of money without success, they tore up the tickets of all six kidnapped people one after another. In the end, only one person was released after being wounded in the waist by the bandits. After the case occurred, the county government repeatedly ordered its subordinates to pursue and arrest the perpetrators. After committing the crime, the bandits came to Shanghai to hide. Recently, the Huaian County Government found out about this, so it sent Zhi Xiaoshun, the captain of the Mounted Patrol Squadron of the Public Security Bureau of Huaian County, along with detectives Zhang Yadong, Liu Naifu, Cui Tinggui, Duangui, and Gao Congjin, to Shanghai to arrest them. Yesterday morning, the detectives received a tip that the bandit leaders Cai Dianzu and Cai Dianfu were hiding in a bungalow in Zhangjiabang, Wusong. At around 9:00 AM, the captain went to the address and arrested Cai Dianzu. Cai Dianfu had already escaped. The captured bandit was taken to the Seventh District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning. Since the case was a serious case involving tearing up tickets, he was ordered to be handed over to the original detectives to be taken back to the Huaian County Government for investigation. When the bandit arrived at the North Station, he was questioned and stated that he was 31 years old, from the northern countryside of Huaian, with deeply sunken eyes and a rather fierce appearance.</p>

<p>After the death of Ma Shaoqing, the former manager of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, all his relatives and friends deeply mourned his loss. Many telegrams of condolence have come from all sides. Here are some excerpts: (Telegram from Ju Zheng) Ningbo Road Shanghai Bank to the family of Mr. Ma Shaoqing: "I was informed by a friend that Mr. Shaoqing has passed away, and I am deeply saddened. Shaoqing was a stalwart comrade from Hubei and participated in the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution, making outstanding achievements. After the success, he did not seek recognition, but studied in Europe and gained insights into world economics. After returning to China, he dedicated his knowledge to society, engaged in banking, regulated finance, and supported production. He also constantly helped his comrades. He was praised by contemporaries as a savior of thousands of families. Now that he is in his prime, just when we hoped that he would continue to improve and benefit all living beings, why did Heaven take him so quickly? With our country's economic backwardness and the rapid decline of wise men, those who know and those who do not know must share this grief. I only hope that his soul will be reborn on the lotus platform and return to this world to incarnate countless times and spread throughout the ten directions to save all sentient beings with all kinds of incredible divine powers. Then Shaoqing's original life will not perish, and his family can take comfort in this. I offer this eulogy, please accept it with proper ceremony. Ju Zheng." (Telegrams from home and abroad) (1) "The news of Mr. Ma Qing's sudden passing at your bank has reached us. We are deeply saddened. We send this telegram of condolence. The Singapore He Feng Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, and Hua Bank." (2) "The passing of Mr. Ma Shaoqing of your bank is deeply regrettable. We send this telegram of condolence.

<p>Changxing's Thorough Care of Passengers: The Chicago World's Fair in June of this year hired Mr. Zhang Bichen and Mr. Shen Huating, technicians from Beiping, to go to the United States to arrange the Chinese-style temple buildings. However, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Shen were not familiar with Western languages and had never traveled far across the ocean. The association entrusted the Changxing Company to take care of them. Starting from Beiping, they first went to Shanghai and then transferred to the Changxing Asia Queen ship to go to the United States. The Chinese staff of the company took care of them along the way. They arrived in Chicago via Vancouver, Canada, a journey of more than 5,000 nautical miles. With the care of the Changxing Company there, the procedures for overseas Chinese affairs and customs were handled properly. The travel time was not wasted. They arrived at the meeting on August 4.

<h3 id="e190">Schools Subsidized by the Labor Bureau Must Focus on Cleanliness <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>At the meeting of the Education Committee of the Public Concession Labor Bureau on the 16th, the Director of the Health Department submitted a detailed report on the sanitary conditions of the Chinese schools receiving subsidies. Among them, the sites of five schools were particularly unsuitable, and it was considered that the subsidy funds should be used to find new sites. After discussion, a committee member said that when the sub-committee considered granting subsidies in the past, although they felt that the cleanliness of several schools was not very satisfactory, they suggested granting subsidies because they were the only schools in that location. All the members also believed that it might not be easy for all schools to get satisfactory houses, but the previously established stipulation that the cleanliness should meet the rules of the Health Department was actually beneficial to the schools themselves. Therefore, it was decided that the autumn subsidies would be issued as usual, but the five schools in question should be notified that the issuance of subsidies would have to wait until they moved to a satisfactory location, and that the Finance Department should be allowed to urge the Director of the Health Department to issue the subsidy funds designated for construction as necessary, according to the amount used. This resolution has been approved by the Board of Directors on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>Inspection of Curriculum in Chinese Middle Schools: A committee member of the Education Committee of the Public Concession Labor Bureau suggested last time that the principals of Chinese middle schools and girls' middle schools should cooperate with the Chinese vice-principals of their respective schools to report the time spent on each subject in each grade every week to the Education Supervisor, who would then report to the committee to inform them of which subjects are taught in English or Chinese, as well as what textbooks are used and what the nationality of the teachers is. With the consent of all the members, the principals of each school were asked to do so, and the same investigation will be carried out in primary schools in each district in the future. This resolution has been approved by the Board of Directors on the 23rd for implementation, and the Director-General explained that the committee members' hope is that the Chinese language courses in each school will be as consistent as possible with the curriculum of national schools in China.</p>
<p>New School Will Change to Flat-Roofed Building: At the last meeting of the Board of Directors of the Public Concession Labor Bureau, a director said that sports fields in various schools cannot be supplied as much as possible. When building new schools in the future, flat-roofed buildings should be built, and the roof should be used as a place for recreation. The chairman of the Education Committee presented this proposal to the committee. The public opinion is to ask the subcommittee in charge of construction to give special consideration to this method when reviewing future new school sites.</p>
<p>Yuyuan Road Playground Closed: The children's playground on Yuyuan Road has been closed because the construction of the new Western children's school in the Western District is about to begin there.</p>

The calligraphy and paintings on display are rare treasures that are not easy to obtain from the outside, such as Zhao Yong's genuine works and famous works from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, ten large Chinese paintings by Liu Haisu, and several extremely valuable oil paintings by Liu. Therefore, those who won paintings with a single ticket were very happy and satisfied. It is said that the exhibition of famous ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings will last for eight more days, and the exhibition of recent works by teachers and students was originally scheduled to close today. Now, due to the crowded audience, it has been extended for two more days until 6:00 pm on the 27th. As for calligraphy and painting coupons, they are sold at the exhibition site and in the Shanghai Art College.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the Chinese Women's Basketball Association, the Liangjiang and Southeast teams have won every game in Group A. The hope of winning the championship is high. They will meet at the Chinese Basketball Hall at 7:30 tonight to determine the champion. The players on both sides are evenly matched and have their own skills. Tonight's game will be worth watching.

<p>Only two Group B matches were held last night, and the Group A Liangjiang vs. Jinan match was postponed. In Group B, Chongde was defeated by Xiaguang, with a score of 23 to 21. The competition between the two teams was very worth seeing. Wang Xiangying, a strong player from Chongde, was closely watched by Zhan Chunbing of Xiaguang, and had little activity. Throughout the game, Chongde had the advantage. The first half ended with a score of 12 to 9. However, in the third quarter, Xiaguang worked hard and fought hard. Zhuang Lingzhao was agile and made great achievements, gaining an advantage with a score of 7 to 2. Xiaguang won with a score of 16 to 14. In the last quarter, each team scored seven points. Therefore, Xiaguang won the final victory.</p>
<p>Also, the Group B game between Southeast and Liangjiang was clear and worth seeing. Southeast won with a score of 24 to 9. Currently, in Group B, the only team that has maintained a winning streak is Southeast. It seems quite confident in winning the championship. The results of the two games last night are as follows:</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Inter-Port Football Team, led by the Chinese Mr. Mo Ying-kui, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the President McKinley of the Dollar Steamship Lines. At noon, they disembarked at the new customs wharf. They were greeted by a large crowd, including Mr. Hamson, secretary of the Western Football Club, Xu, captain of the Shanghai Inter-Port Team, reporters from various newspapers, and over a hundred football fans, who gathered around the wharf eager to catch a glimpse of their style. Their deep infatuation is evident.</p>
<p>〓 Team Appearance 〓</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team consists of sixteen people: leader Ying-kui, manager Holland, captain and goalkeeper Roger (Hong Kong Football Club), left back Muir (Welsh), right back Sturridge (Hong Kong Football Club), center back Pido (Artillery Team), left midfielder Duncan (Hong Kong Football Club), right midfielder Baleis (Kowloon Football Club), center forward Howie (Hong Kong Football Club), left inside forward Wong Mei-shun (South China), right inside forward Sun Kam-shun (China), left winger Bardley (Lincoln), right winger Zheng Shao-kang (South China), reserves: defender Liu Mao (South China), center back Liang Rong-zhao (South China), forward Balayan (Artillery Team). They are staying at the Palace Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>〓 Afternoon Practice 〓</p>
<p>After a short rest, at 3:00 PM, they went to the Racecourse football field for practice, a light warm-up to relieve the fatigue of the three-day sea journey. Photography reporters rushed to take photos of them. The five forwards' movements were remarkable. Zheng Shao-kang, Sun Kam-shun, and Wong Mei-shun were among them, along with center forward Howie and left winger Bardley. Their strength is not weak. No particular performance was seen from the defenders, so no judgment can be made.</p>
<p>〓 Mr. Mo's Remarks 〓</p>
<p>The reporter had a conversation with Mr. Mo Ying-kui, the first Chinese leader of the Hong Kong team. Mr. Mo is the chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Sports Advancement Association. He spoke about the recent situation of the Hong Kong-Guangdong football scene and the selection process for this Hong Kong team. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>The Strength of the Hong Kong Team: The Hong Kong team's strength is in the forwards, which are good, with the three generals Sun, Wong, and Zheng, and Howie and Balayan being especially excellent. However, the defenders are somewhat inferior. No Chinese players were selected. If one or two generals from South China could be added, they would be stronger.</p>
<p>Selection Not Fully Satisfactory: The Hong Kong side expressed dissatisfaction with the selected team members. In the first friendly match, the intended team lost 3-0 to the Sino-Western United Team. In the second match, they lost 4-2 to the All-Chinese Team. Poor cooperation is the biggest reason. For example, Wong Mei-shun is a center back talent, but now he is being used as a left inside forward, which may not be suitable. There are also talented defenders in South China and China, but it is a pity that they could not be selected. I (Mr. Mo referring to himself) am the only Chinese selection committee member, so I am powerless.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Hong Kong Football: South China and China have excellent results in the Hong Kong League. South China has only lost two points, so they have a good chance of winning the league. Since the split between the Chinese Sports Association and the Hong Kong Football Club last year and their withdrawal, they have reached a compromise again this year. The Hong Kong Football Club has begun to have a considerable understanding of the Association.</p>
<p>Preparing to Win the Governor's Cup: The Sports Association and the Hong Kong Football Club, in order to promote communication, have initiated the Governor's Cup competition this year. The Association team is the All-Chinese Team, and the Hong Kong Football Club team is the Western team. The winner is the one who wins two out of three matches. The first match is scheduled for mid-December. South China and China are working hard to practice cooperation.</p>
<p>Guangzhou's Situation is a Tragic Decline: Since Mr. Chen Ce and Director Zhang Hui left Guangdong, the situation in Guangzhou has declined sharply. The air and naval forces cannot form teams; only the police remain. Therefore, only four teams participated in the Guangnai Cup. Even the police team, despite having generals such as Li Tiansheng, Tan Jiangbai, and Ye Bi-hua, lost to Lingnan University. There is a sigh that there is no one to promote sports.</p>
<p>Willing to See the China Team: I heard that the Shanghai China team is very strong, with many talents. They will have a friendly match with the Hong Kong team on Sunday. I am very willing to watch and learn about the progress of the Shanghai football scene.</p>
<p>Praising Sports Commentary: The reporter presented several copies of the Sports Commentary Weekly, co-published by many Shanghai sports reporters, and the special issue for this Inter-Port competition. Mr. Mo praised them endlessly, saying that there are few domestic sports publications and that he hopes everyone will do their best to promote them and that he will do his best to introduce them in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Diligent Feast for Mr. Mo: At 7:00 PM last night, the Diligent Bookstore hosted a feast at the Dadong Restaurant for the sports community and to welcome Mr. Mo Ying-kui. In addition to Mr. Mo, those who attended included Shen Si-liang, Jiang Xiang-qing, Rong Qi-zhao, Feng Jian-wei, Yu Wei-zhi, Zhang Guo-xun, Ling Xi-tao, Yue Xiu-rong, Peng Wen-yu, Chen De, Lu Xu-qian, Wang Fu-dan, Shen Kun-nan, Lu Zhong-en, and more than twenty others. Mr. Mo praised the sports series published by the bookstore. During the feast, Diligent distributed "Race Walking Training Method" written by Lu Xiang-qian and prefaced by Shi Zai-hui, published yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Barro's Opinion on Net Cord Balls <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>= Net Cord Balls are the Most Perfect Shot in Tennis =</p>
<p>= Must Carefully Change Rules of Decades =</p>
<p>丨Reasons Why Net Cord Balls Should Not Be Replayed丨</p>
<p>(London Dispatch) Interest in the proposal to change the current tennis rules continues to increase, but 85% of expert opinions oppose the change.</p>
<p>The opinion of the French veteran Barro is endorsed by all. Barro said,</p>
<p>One of the Tennis Skills: Tennis is a sport where the most perfect shot is a ball that just grazes the net. This is the perfect state that all balls aspire to achieve. Therefore, I do not think it is appropriate to suggest that it should be considered invalid and replayed as a penalty. Moreover, it will cause a lot of disruption in the match. Of course, a net cord ball is a lucky ball, but a match should also have some luck. In short, I believe the current ball rules are very perfect and should be maintained. Rules that have been approved for decades should be changed very carefully. What I am talking about naturally concerns net cord balls during the match, not for the server. For serves, they should be replayed. There are sufficient reasons for replaying a serve that hits the net because the rules stipulate that the receiver cannot attack, so the server can hit the ball arbitrarily between the service line and the net. Therefore, the receiver must stand near the baseline. As a result, balls that hit the net and drop cannot be obtained. In mutual rallies, the receiver can always meet the ball when it crosses the net and return it. If they are at the net, they can also have the opportunity to save most of the net cord balls and also want to have the same kind of return.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Begging for Help From the League <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The time for the League of Nations Council to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute is approaching. People sleeping on pillows embroidered with the words "Begging for Help From the League of Nations" are once again dreaming all sorts of good dreams.</p>
<p>Japan's diplomacy is becoming isolated. All countries except Japan do not recognize the existence of Manchukuo! France seems to be clearing away suspicions of siding with Japan, and the United States is implementing recognition of Soviet Russia, giving Japan a major threat. All of these are sweet dreams that are constantly emerging while sleeping on the pillow.</p>
<p>Can the dream become a reality? I don't think so. Even if it becomes a reality, will Japan obey the world's public opinion? I don't think so. Even if we believe that it will obey public opinion, can the Northeast, which has been occupied for many years, be returned to China unconditionally? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Even if we recognize that it will be returned to China unconditionally, can China, which has always relied on others, obtain this good result of begging for help from the League of Nations and then become a rich and strong country? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Instead of begging for help from the League of Nations, it is better to beg for help from "Ourselves United"! What is "Ourselves United"? It is for our own people to unite with each other, put aside private grudges, old grievances, conspiracies, schemes, and other acts of infighting, such as fighting wits, fighting strength, and fighting for cities and territories. Then, no matter how the League of Nations handles the Sino-Japanese dispute, China can always stand in a position of winning without losing. The authority of the words "Ourselves United" is far above the League of Nations. People who like to dream good dreams, quickly put aside this pillow of begging for help from the League of Nations and, at the same time, work together to fully consolidate the work of begging for help from "Ourselves United"!</p>
<p>The two Liu brothers fighting fiercely in Sichuan, looking at the fact that they share the same surname, should unite as one at this time. Don't break our work of "Begging for Help from Ourselves United" and send a gift of "Defaming China" to Matsuoka Yosuke to take to Geneva.</p>

<p>— Xu Tongye</p>
<p>丨Sending Female Aviator Lin Pengxia to Northwest for Investigation丨</p>
<p>Since the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the people of our country deeply know that China's lack of air force is detrimental to national defense. At sea, there is the organization of the China Aviation Construction Association, to awaken the people, its intention is good. Our country's population is large, and the land is vast, being the first in the world, but everything is backward, causing it to be despised by all countries. How can we not sigh? Taking aviation as an example, the United States in 1931 already had 10,635 aircraft and 30,509 pilots, of which women accounted for 510. The United Kingdom is roughly the same. The Northeast has more than 250 aircraft, but it cannot retain one or two, let alone other places. However, China's aviation talent is not completely absent, because there are too many people and too few jobs, and aviation experts have no place to stand. The government has been running aviation for more than 20 years, from Yuan Shikai's hosting of the Nanyuan Aviation School to the present. Apart from purchasing imported aircraft with large sums of money, no other construction work is worth mentioning, which is a great disappointment to the people's expectations. Now, the only female aviator in China, Comrade Lin Pengxia, will have a trip to the Northwest, and various circles are feasting on her every evening. The reason why we express our admiration for this trip of the lady is not because of her amiable personality and outstanding talent, but because the lady was born into a large family and enjoys a life of luxury, so she does not have to travel through mountains and rivers and delve into the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. Now, the lady can sacrifice material enjoyment, embrace the spirit of fearlessness, and go to the Northwest to investigate alone. Has any Chinese woman ever had such ambitions before? However, this is still not enough. When the lady was studying aviation in the United Kingdom, her flying performance was the best in the entire British female aviation community, making Westerners look sideways and praising her as the Flying General of China. From then on, they did not dare to underestimate the Chinese, so the lady's contribution to the personality of the Chinese nation is truly great. Amy Johnson created a record of British flying, and the government's awards and public propaganda are spared no effort. Although our country is called a semi-colonial country, there are also those who can compare with Amy Johnson, but where is the government's award? Where is the public's propaganda? Although Comrade Lin is a weak woman, her patriotism is far better than that of men. She originally wanted to go to Shanghai to participate in the Anti-Japanese War, but because the peace treaty had been signed, her long-cherished ambition was not fulfilled. However, the Northeast Volunteer Army is still fighting hard, and the Xikang dispute is becoming increasingly acute, with Xinjiang and Qinghai also being affected. Therefore, she decided to go to the Northwest first to investigate the political economy and the people's suffering, and plan the way of development. Her ambition is commendable, and her contribution is great. We only pray for her success and win glory for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>I accidentally learned from a friend in Hangzhou about the death of Ms. Wang Suxiang of the Hangzhou Zhijiang Daily. So, from a state of sorrow and grief, I remembered everything about her life:</p>
<p>Ms. Wang was from Taizhou, Zhejiang. She had a plump figure, thick and wide eyebrows, and thick and large lips, all of which fully expressed her upright nature and courageous spirit. When the Revolutionary Army launched from Guangdong,</p>

<p>She joined the revolutionary work and served as a political trainer in a division headquarters. It is said that she held the rank of a staff officer above a captain. At this time, she fell in love with a comrade, Mr. Xiang Shiyuan, a member of the assembly. Later, they both gave up fighting and devoted themselves to writing, founding the Hangzhou City Daily in Hangzhou. Mr. Xiang became the editor-in-chief, and Ms. Wang became the president. Therefore, Ms. Wang resolutely divorced her husband and declared a formal marriage union with Mr. Xiang.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang was good at speaking and good at socializing. No matter what meeting or group it was, her presence was indispensable. It can truly be said that she attended every meeting and spoke at every meeting. I remember that during the opening of the West Lake Exposition, Shanghai reporters went to Hangzhou together. At the Hangzhou Municipal Government's reception for reporters, Ms. Wang's words were like springs, flowing endlessly. She compared the Shanghai reporters to big birds and the Hangzhou reporters to little birds, which was immediately spread throughout the Shanghai and Hangzhou newspapers. To this day, the classic of "birds" still occupies a page in the story of news reporters.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang was not only good at ordinary socializing but also good at special socializing. The chairman of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, Wang Zhuzhai, was her godfather, and Mr. Meng Lujiu, the former chairman of the Hangzhou Business and People's Association, was also her godfather. As for her own goddaughters, there were too many to count. Ms. Zhou Wenying, a famous socialite who once caused a sensation in the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers, was also one of her goddaughters. Since the Hangzhou Shenbao stopped publication, they continued to run the Zhijiang Daily. Ms. Wang served as the deputy president, running around every day, using her eloquence to raise funds. However, she eventually became exhausted and unable to maintain it. So, she gave the title of president to a Mr. Xu Zhuofu, while Ms. Wang herself abandoned the spirit of running the newspaper and engaged in social work.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang was also a tough woman. She had been involved in several lawsuits for running the newspaper. Once, because of a dispute with the Hangzhou Electric Power Plant, she was jointly sued by the plant for three crimes: theft, defamation, and false accusation. She was detained in Zhejiang's First Prison for several months. When I went to visit her in prison, her haggard face did not diminish her fortitude. Later, thanks to the efforts of Zhuang Songfu, Chen Guofu, Wang Zhuzhai, and other elders, she was safely released from prison.</p>
<p>When the January 28th Incident occurred this year, Ms. Wang organized a Hangzhou Women's Rescue Team and established a branch of the Red Cross in Minhang's Minyuan. She managed it for several months, working hard and without complaint. After returning to Hangzhou, some people said that she had earned more than 10,000 yuan. But according to her own defense, her poor life had not changed.</p>
<p>Now, Ms. Wang has unfortunately died. At least there are several criticisms from people in society about her final conclusion. One is sarcasm with ridicule, and the other is admiration and regret. The former is inevitably harsh, and the latter is too obvious. Overall, I believe that this famous social flower has died too miserably and is pitiful!</p>
<p>After Ms. Wang's death, some people are suggesting building a "Shrine" for her in Fancun, Hang County, and holding regular sacrifices every year. It is expected that if this matter is implemented, then the story of the female hero of the lake and mountains will not be exclusive to Qiu Jin.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Remembering Ye Mingchen <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zhong</p>
<p>丨The Inventor of the Six No's Policy丨</p>
<p>Everyone who has read the history of China for the past hundred years knows that Ye Mingchen was an official who procrastinated and misled the country. He rose from the governor of Guangdong to the governor-general of Liangguang, and was also made a grand academician. His name and position were truly prominent for a time. However, he was a man who liked to brag and was self-conceited. He never took the high-nosed people seriously, so when the Anglo-French Allied Forces first entered Guangdong, he remained calm and indifferent, as if nothing had happened. Although his subordinates repeatedly urged him to seek ways to resist, he only listened to them as "wind in his ears," saying that it would soon subside. When the British army entered Guangzhou, he was unable to defend himself and had to surrender. Fortunately, he still had a thick skin and was not ashamed of being captured. Even though he was exiled to a foreign country (India), he was able to enjoy himself. Sometimes he wrote and painted with people (signing his name as Su Wu of the Sea) to make a living. Later, he died in India. People revered him as the inventor of the Six No's Policy to commemorate his great achievements(?). His Six No's Policy was: 1. No War, 2. No Peace, 3. No Defense, 4. No Death, 5. No Surrender, 6. No Escape. This Six No's Policy was lost for forty or fifty years after his death until the September 18th Northeast Incident occurred last year, when his followers re-implemented them one by one. I think Mr. Ye, if he knew in the afterlife, would cover his face and laugh, saying, "My principles are not isolated!"</p>

<p>— Yao Zhenya</p>
<p>Ms. Chen Xiujuan, a relative of mine, has been suffering from tuberculosis for many years. Whenever it flares up, her cough and hemoptysis become even more severe, coupled with night sweats and fevers, making it almost unbearable. Recently, I learned that she was introduced by Dr. Zheng, the director of the Changzhou Chengji Hospital, to take the Yijincao from Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company, and she has recovered. It is said that this herb has been proven by famous doctors such as Xia Yingtang, the chairman of the National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations, and Xie Liheng, the executive director of the Central National Medical Hall. It is indeed a sacred remedy for the natural cure of pulmonary tuberculosis. The company is located at No. 203 Zhonghua Road, Shanghai. It is recently heard that a North City branch sales office has been established at No. 28 Deyuli, Xikou, Yingda Road.</p>

<p>— Fan Yan</p>
<p>"Cattle herding! Not boasting!" Liu Da sneered coldly. The dinner ended hastily after the debate. Liu Da smoked a dry pipe and went to sleep. Liu's wife continued to peel sunflower seeds under the still dimly lit sky and went to sleep as well. Only A Gen was left and still not sleeping. He knew that even if he went to sleep, he wouldn't be able to fall asleep, so he might as well arrange everything properly first and then go to sleep and sleep more peacefully. When the old couple were both snoring, he quietly went to pack his luggage. This luggage was ridiculously simple because his cotton clothes were still in the pawnshop in Suzhou. He couldn't redeem them until he sold the new rice for money. There was no need to bring summer clothes. There was only a patched cotton vest and a set of shirts and trousers, two pairs of old socks that he had begged from a wealthy family in the city, and nothing else. Thinking of the old saying, "You have to bring small change when you go out," he secretly poured all the banknotes from his mother's pillow into his bag. There were only three silver dollars and four silver coins, which he felt was too little. He also rummaged for a long time in a broken jar under his grandfather's bed and found two banknotes with grains of wheat on them, one a five-yuan note from the Bank of China and the other a one-yuan note from the Bank of Communications. He still remembered that this was the money left over from selling Ai Gu to repay the debt, which was originally prepared to be sent to the clerk of Lawyer Xia but the clerk had kindly returned it to him. Putting them together, he was still short six corners and dozens of cents of the ten dollars. He had already "exhausted his humble resources." He didn't know what the old couple would do if they found out about this great escape tomorrow, would they place an advertisement in the newspaper to arrest him! But he couldn't worry about so much. After packing up, he lay down with his clothes on in his bed in the outer room, still unable to sleep. He heard a rustling sound outside the door and suspected that it was raining. If it rained, it would create more problems. He carefully distinguished that it was not rain but the wind blowing the elm tree outside the door, and the tree leaves and branches were rubbing against the corner of the house. Was it dawn? No, the moonlight was too bright, so he knew that it was the latter half of the night. As the old saying goes, "At twenty-five or six, the moon is at its fullest at the fourth watch."</p>
<p>Liu Da got up early, so A Gen quietly opened the door and went out with his small bag before the sky had fully brightened. He quickened his pace and knocked on Jiang Niupi's door in one breath. Jiang Niupi got up and opened the door, letting him in. His aunt sleepily heated water for him to boil porridge, and after they ate, they said goodbye and went to the lakeside to wait for the sailing boat.</p>
<p>Although the time was different, the position was different, leaving his hometown to change his life was exactly the same as when Ai Gu stood blankly by the lake. A Gen thought, she still had me carrying her small bag, sending her off, asking her "when are you coming back?" What about me? ... He didn't allow himself to think any further! The Suzhou passenger ship, which was good at moving people around and creating a lot of idle gossip, came. A Gen hurriedly picked up his small bag and boarded the ship, unable to turn back to look at his hometown. Until he was far away from Cuiwei Village, he vaguely saw two people standing by the lake in the misty dawn, not knowing if they were grandfather and mother? Because he had also stood by the lake for such a long time, sadly watching Ai Gu's departure.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Financial Bullion Market Remains Strong <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>(Frequent New High Prices) The market yesterday showed a bullish trend again, with slight changes, but the overall trend was good, and new high prices appeared. There were a total of five taels and three mace [unit of weight] of transactions throughout the day. In retrospect, comparing it with the previous afternoon's high of five taels and six mace, the will of the dealers was firm and strong. Initially, it exceeded the 760 tael mark. Although the silver market did not move and the exchange rate fluctuated, it was due to the decline in US dollars and the efforts of the Guangdong merchants to short sell. With the stability of foreign exchange, British pounds and US dollars, the market atmosphere became even more vibrant. It was seen at 67 taels and 8 qian [unit of currency]. Unexpectedly, many long positions were sold off by Fuchang and others, and there were also reports that the US Morgan Company had lent a large number of ounces to the British government. As a result, gold prices turned from strong to weak. Later, there were rumors that war bonds could be used as collateral for currency and stocks, which further fueled the selling frenzy. Finally, it fell to 62 taels and 5 qian. Afterwards, with the exchange rate stabilizing and buying interest remaining strong, the market recovered. All swap transactions were quite active, with Yingfeng Heng and Fuchang swapping with short sellers such as Tong Taichang, Dadecheng, and Ruilian, and the premium ranging from 4 taels and a half to 3 taels and 2 qian. Dacheng and Ruixing had premiums of 4 taels to 3 taels and a half. Yingfeng Heng, Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, Hengxing, Yifeng, etc., were calculated at 3 taels and 8 qian to 3 taels and 3 qian. Finally, it was heard that 3 taels could be swapped, which was actually because the long positions were willing to swap out, and it was also to suppress the short positions, which led to the price being reduced. It is estimated that there were only about two to three thousand contracts.</p>
<p>(Opening Jumps Five Tael) The January opening price was 763 taels and 5 qian, an increase of 4 taels (before the market opened, the initial trading was one or two taels), followed by four taels and some change, with active buying. Moreover, Yifeng Yongyifeng, Dadecheng, Yuanchun, Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Hengxing, Tong Taichang, and others competed to buy. Due to the strength of the US dollar, the price for January 25th, December 31.25, reached 67 taels at 9:15. Suddenly, Yongfeng, Hengxing Yuan, Hengchang Yong, and Hengyu came to sell, bringing the price down to 5 taels and 7 qian. HSBC quoted the British gold price without change, and the US dollar was reduced by .25. The domestic market was also strong. Wah Bi entered the March US dollar at 56.25 to 62.5, and also issued shillings at 75, which was for foreign exchange trading, reaching 7 taels and 4 qian. After a while, it returned to 6 taels and 2 qian. Suddenly, Da Xingyong, Yuantai, Yifeng Yong, and Yuanheng bought in, and the US dollar settlement was not delayed. Citibank issued February at 43.75, and Wah Bi and Mai Hang issued December at 18.75. At 10:10, the new price of 67 taels and 8 qian was reached. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of one tael, and the trading was not strong, with both buying and selling being scattered. Only slightly downstream, it was at 66 taels and some change. Around 11 o'clock, Hengxing and Fuchang and others took to the field to sell off, and because the December US dollar could be settled at .25, it immediately dropped to 5 taels and 3 qian. In a moment, it was pulled up one tael, and after 11:30, it turned downward again. Yuan Maoyong, Hengxing Yuan, Hengchang Yong Yuanheng, Hengyu and others sold off, and the January US gold half yuan, causing the price to break through to 5 taels. At that time, rumors suddenly spread that a US company was lending money to the UK, and that war bonds could be repaid with gold and silver, which was unfavorable to the long positions, causing people's hearts to be exhausted, with only 4 taels and 2 qian. By noon, it was 4 taels and 4 qian, and it was done to 5 taels again. Dadecheng bought and sold, and finally it was 63 taels and a half, and it was still not easy to sell off.</p>
<p>(Weakened then Recovered) The afternoon market opened at 63 taels and 9 qian. Qingfa, Yongyifeng, Bingxing, Yongfeng, and others came to buy, and it was increased to 5 taels and 2 qian. Not long after, Dadecheng, Yuhe, Hengchang Yong, Fuchang, Yuan Maoyong and others sold off, and there were rumors about the war bond issue, and that stocks could be used as collateral, but suddenly there was a limit to gold and silver, which made people's hearts even softer. The February US dollar half yuan could be settled, and finally at 2:20, it was 62 taels and 5 qian. After that, buyers were active, with Fuxingyong, Zhifengyong, Yongfeng, and Hengxing buying, adding more than two taels. At 2:45, it was 5 taels and 2 qian. Later, Fuchang, Yuanchun, Bingxing and others sold a lot, and Zhongfu issued the February US dollar half yuan, March 56.25, and March British gold 68.75, until 4 o'clock it was 3 taels and 9 qian (but after 3 o'clock there were only a few qian盤頭, standing at 4 taels and change). Then Qingfa Yong and Yifeng Yong dragged in, and the British did foreign exchange trading at 3.2625, and then the price rose by one tael and a half, to 5 taels and 4 qian. By the 4:30 close, it was 65 taels and 1 qian, compared to the previous afternoon plus 5 taels and 6 qian. According to the highest price of the day, 7 taels and 8 qian, the minimum of 2 taels and a half, the difference was 5 taels and 3 qian. The gross increase was 13 taels and 7 qian and 5, due to the reduced impact of swap transactions.</p>
<p>(Longs Suppressed Two Tael) The bid price was quoted with the US dollar hanging at a small .25, so it was changed to 831 taels, counting 645 taels to 63 taels. The noon closing was 678 taels, the afternoon 67 taels, 66 taels, then 68 taels again, and finally 66 taels, more than the previous noon by two taels. Booked for this month 71 taels, June 70 taels, January 64 taels, water补上 in the morning 68 taels, in the afternoon 69 taels.</p>
<p>(Longs and Shorts Clash) There was quite active trading on the floor, with longs and shorts offsetting each other. Statistics show that Tong Taichang, Yifeng Yong, Bingxing, Yuanchun, Yuantai, Da Xingyong, Futaiheng, Hongxing, and Zhifengyong all entered smoothly. Yuanheng, Hengchang Yong, Yuan Kangxiang, Yongfeng, Hengxing Yuan, and Yuhe all exited. Fuchang had quite a few exits, Dadecheng entered early and exited in the afternoon, Yuan Maoyong and Hengyu were troubled by entries and exits. In the afternoon, Qingfa Yong, Yongfeng, Yuantai, Ruixing, and others all entered. Yuan Maoyong, Yifeng Yong, Yuhe, Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanchun, and Hengchang Yong all exited. Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, and Bingxing had inconsistent entries and exits. The Dalian traders exited more than 400 and entered more than 300. The Guangdong traders actively补空 more than 3,000 in the morning market. Hengxing had about 300 entries and exits, and in the afternoon they were all small numbers.</p>

<p>During this week, the loading of cash dollars to various ports has been very active, especially the Dalian traders' purchases and loadings. The other day, 3 million were shipped out, and yesterday a second batch of 2.4 million was shipped out, packed into 480 boxes, which were loaded into the hold last night and exported today.

In addition, a total of 850,000 was loaded to the Yangtze River, Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, and various inland ports.

<p>丨Other Gains Have Not Weakened Either丨</p>
<p>丨Transaction Volume of 10.5 Million丨</p>
<p>Yesterday (24th), the spot trading on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was still sparse, with a total opening of 27,100 yuan. However, the market sentiment was lively, with active buying and selling. It is estimated that more than 5.7 million was opened in the morning market, and more than 4.7 million yuan in the afternoon market, totaling 10,051,500 yuan. Among them, salt tax accounted for 2.06 million, consolidated tax more than 1.5 million, and troop reduction and 19 customs duty each had more than 1.3 million yuan. However, only the November term for the 96 financial instruments was opened, and trading was still sparse. Only the buying interest was absolutely dominant, and the rising trend did not weaken. As the settlement period approached, the market competed to buy in, and zero-account investors were also active. Therefore, although the bond market phenomenon did not change much, the sentiment was very good, and the market presented a squeezed state, with the demand and supply situation often being very different. As for the change process, except for the troop reduction that broke through 56 yuan, which had more than one yuan of change, others seemed relatively stable. The near-term troop reduction rose by as much as 1 yuan and 7 jiao [unit of currency], and the next month's term and the 19 customs this month's term all rose by more than 1 yuan, and other terms rose by 4 or 5 jiao to 7 or 8 jiao. Also, it is said that the consolidated salt, 20 customs, and rolled spot prices also rose quite a bit.</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday's sources were in constant streams, about fifty numbers, and the stores in the urban and rural areas were not very active, the thick粳行情 suddenly rose by Jiao. The late稻货 goods were still not strong, the sales market yesterday had a package weight of 430 packages, which was ostensibly stacked, but actually prepared for export. Due to the provincial government's order strictly prohibiting exports, it is understood that the Tianjin traders were doing business. Foreign杜尖 reached sales were fine, the market did not rise or fall, and the 变阴元酒户 did not move, so the price was tired.</p>
<p>(Xin Zha) Yesterday, thirty-five or six ships arrived on the Suzhou River, and business on this street was not good. Changxi North 粳 and Danyang Yixing rice were all short of one jiao, the 变阴元 had no RongRu. The early and late rice were sold as soon as they arrived, and the price increased by Jiao. The price of foreign杜尖 was similar to the original market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month were generally flat, with the foreign Ginseng quotation rebounding by a small triangle. Although people's hearts were at peace, the market stagnated due to the sluggishness of the selling. Moreover, this month's price was still standing firm, and each factory had no intention of delivering goods. The long-term price was then held up. When the afternoon market opened, the price for this month was still held up, with very little fluctuation. Due to the competition from long-term sellers, the selling became smooth, and it was rumored that the Japanese merchants had newly arrived洋麦 three or four ships. It was said that it had already been imported, so people's hearts became more empty. From December to April, the prices fell step by step. Observing the future, if the sales market does not rise after the river is closed, there will be a change. As a result, this month's price was down a small two li and a half from the previous day, December's price was down one fen, January's price was down seven li and a half, February's price was down one fen and two li and a half, and March and April's prices were down one fen and a half.</p>

<p>丨Buying is Weak and Selling is Impossible丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's future wheat market, after the opening of the upper and lower markets, the prices for each month generally stagnated, because there was a shortage of actual chips in the exchange, and both buyers and sellers had no targets to seek, and although the trend of foreign wheat was still not good, the domestic arrivals were also sparse, so buying was weak and selling was impossible. There were many empty auctions throughout the day, and the market price did not fluctuate.</p>

<p>Hardware trading has been very quiet recently. Apart from a few minor transactions in the city, large-scale deals are still rare. However, market conditions in various cities are thriving due to supply shortages. For example, galvanized iron roofing sheets, new iron wire, iron factory nails, green lead bars, galvanized iron sheets, bamboo-shaped iron, etc., are all showing signs of price increases. The price of British galvanized iron had been rising rapidly due to shallow inventories, but recently, continuous arrivals have created a situation where the standard grade appears strong but is actually weak. The price of thin, patterned sheets is also showing signs of a slight decrease of one or two cents per sheet. Seven-foot sheets are priced at 7.96 taels, and six-foot sheets are priced at 8.2 taels. It is reported that trading is also very slow. However, investigations show that the supply of goods to the market is very extensive, and the price situation is unlikely to return to previous levels.</p>

<h3 id="e253">East and West <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>丨Dependence and Independence丨</p>
<p>When discussing the East and the West, a significant difference is the characteristic of dependence versus independence. These two fundamental natures have created two different kinds of people, 丨the weak and the strong.</p>
<p>In the East, there is no shortage of philanthropists who regard giving alms to beggars as the sole virtue, while Western philanthropists do the opposite. A Chinese man and a Western friend once traveled together to Hangzhou. Hangzhou's beggars are famous throughout the land, a special profession beyond the 360 trades. Many poor children are taught begging skills by their parents from a young age, sending them running through the streets. If you travel to Hangzhou, you may find that the only thing spoiling your pleasant mood is the sight of beggars all over the mountains and streets.</p>
<p>At that time, the Chinese man and his Western friend were visiting Lingyin Temple when a child begged from them, following them for half a mile. At first, everyone refused to give anything. However, the Chinese man, being Chinese after all, couldn't bear it and tossed him a copper coin. The Western friend then said, "The lesson I was just teaching him has been ruined by you. This is a lifelong issue, not a matter of a single copper coin. You are harming him, cultivating his dependence, not saving him." His words were filled with regret. The same event, the same concern for the child, reveals the difference in the national character of the East and West. Westerners value "independence," while the East is prone to "dependence."</p>
<p>Looking at material objects, the means of transportation invented in the West are motorcycles and bicycles, while the means of transportation invented in the East are rickshaws, a person-riding-person style. This is a minor matter. More importantly, the weapons used by the West to confront others are "airplanes," "warships," and "tanks," asserting oneself. The weapons used by the East to defend against enemies are "hunger strikes," "telegrams," and "posting slogans," hoping to gain the pity of others. Regardless of whether it concerns a country or a factory, it is questionable whether the "hunger strikes," "telegrams," "posting slogans," and other actions of the weak can achieve victory. Yet, such facts are actually appearing in the political history of the twentieth century. Is this not a manifestation of servility, a disgrace to the East?</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Northeast provinces following the September 18th Incident last year, people in our country have been running around and appealing to the great powers, hoping for assistance, like someone whose house has been robbed and relatives killed, unable to drive away the thieves themselves, and seeking help from neighbors to catch the thieves and recover the stolen goods. There is no such logic in the world. Now, the League of Nations' investigation report has been released, and the conclusion reached is that "China should be jointly administered by the great powers." These blue-eyed and purple-bearded dignitaries would not have the time to completely help our country, so if the great powers do anything, it is for their own benefit. The word "justice" does not exist in the dictionary of the twentieth century. Therefore, the delusive dream of dependence should be awakened. To recover the Northeast and save the nation from disaster, the entire country must abandon the heart of dependence and exert all its strength to confront it directly. As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." Wilson said, "Justice must be backed by force." These words are enough for us to ponder.</p>
<p>The previous "experiments" (according to a certain important figure) have all failed. In the future, we should use real strength to negotiate. Let the authorities know that the country can no longer endure repeated "experiments."</p>

<p>— Wu Tiansheng</p>
<p>Friends and relatives see me off to Jinling Road, intermittent rain reflects on wine cups, long ago I followed hardship to the border, will carry ice and snow to sketch a lifetime, horizontal sky murderous atmosphere above the clouds, hanging dreams train sound drum horns new, the vast world for a cry, crossing the river, the person before my eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Passing Baozi Rock <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Since the crane's cry disappeared into the white clouds, brocade-like mountains and rivers gave rise to murderous intent. The grass and trees reek of the lingering atmosphere of Daling. The apocalypse of humanity has exhausted Shouyang Mountain. Vainly pitying the Weaver Maid's stifled sobs, how many times have I seen displaced people return with their families. Knowing your efforts to raise your chicks are also bitter, the wave marks forever gnaw at the mossy clothes.</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3 id="e256">Homemade Fruit Jam <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xueqin</p>
<p>When we usually eat bread, we must spread fruit jam on it to make it taste better. However, the fruit jam sold on the market, whether it is banana, rose, or other kinds, is very expensive. Even the cheapest goods cost forty or fifty cents. In this way, it is really uneconomical. You must be able to make it yourself to get a large amount of fruit jam without spending a lot of money. Although this is a small skill, it is beneficial to our economy. Moreover, the method of making fruit jam does not require advanced academic theory, nor does it require sophisticated art. Anyone with a little common sense of cooking chemistry can start making it. I have made it several times in practice, and the results have been very satisfactory. If readers are interested, try it according to the method written below, and it will definitely satisfy you.</p>
<p>The method is to first put the bought tomatoes (it is best to use all red ones, but do not be too ripe) into an iron pot, pour an appropriate amount of clean water into the pot, and heat it with fire to make it undergo a chemical reaction. As long as it takes more than ten minutes, its internal flesh will gradually expand, and the outer skin will open by itself. At this time, use an iron ladle to take them out one by one and put them into a white porcelain basin. After they are cold, peel off their skins by hand. Then, put the peeled tomatoes together with the juice flowing out in the porcelain basin back into the iron pot and heat them again. After another ten minutes, put in white sugar (brown sugar is also acceptable) to taste, and at the same time put in a little osmanthus dew to make it slightly fragrant. After putting all these things together, use an iron rod or iron ladle to stir it constantly to make it mix evenly and to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. When it becomes a thick liquid and turns into a jam color, take it out and seal it in bottles or jars for use.</p>
<p>We only need to use five pounds of tomatoes and one pound of sugar to make five cans of fruit jam. In terms of value, it costs less than half a yuan. Isn't this several times cheaper than buying it on the market? But we must know that those made with white sugar are bright red in color, and those made with brown sugar are purplish-red in color. Adding a little banana dew will turn it into banana fruit jam, and adding a little rose dew will turn it into rose fruit jam. These different points have nothing to do with the nature of the fruit jam itself. The maker can make whichever kind they want.</p>
<p>Speaking of the function of tomato fruit jam, it is not only suitable for the taste. Because these tomatoes contain the most vitamins, we can often eat them to greatly nourish the body and can also treat beriberi and all kinds of dampness and other diseases. This is what we should know.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Turbulence <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>He could no longer bear it, so he said to Yi in a very gentle but very depressed tone: "Ruoyan, you must know that people nowadays are not as reliable as you imagine! If you want me to sacrifice, then it's not a problem, as long as he is indeed good, and you can be happy in the future! But I think, he! Kechang, is just such a mediocre man! And Ken you should also think about the history of our love! ··· Ruoyan, think about it calmly!"</p>
<p>After he said these painful words, he lifted his heavy legs, hung his head, and paced back and forth in the room: Ruoyan seemed to be watching his book without feeling anything. The room was dead silent, and the rustling of the wind and the pattering of the rain outside the window were fueling the tide of his heart, as if playing a song of victory, or the low cry of a disappointed person.</p>
<p>He couldn't bear it any longer. This dead silence, so he said again: "Ruoyan, think about it calmly!" He did not wait for Yi's answer, and went out with a large book of manuscripts.</p>
<p>"What's there to think about? Do you want me to die with you!" As soon as his front foot stepped out of the door, Yi finally opened his mouth. This saying was obviously "thorn," no, it was simply like a sharp knife cutting his heart and liver.</p>
<p>Everyone knows, and envy, the beautiful past of Youshi and Ruoyan.</p>
<p>When they were studying at K School in C City, his talent was so superior, and although her knowledge was not very good, she had that graceful and charming figure, and she was considered the school flower in the eyes of the whole school. Because of several contacts at art exhibitions, they went from classmates to friends, and from friends to lovers. When they got married, who didn't say, "A talented man and a beautiful woman, a match made in heaven!" Even they themselves, didn't they yearn for eternal happiness, especially Youshi.</p>
<p>However, the environment was so teasing. When he was in school, although he didn't dare to say what kind of hope he would have in the future, he had never thought that he would have no food to eat, and he had never thought that Ruoyan would change so suddenly! After leaving school, he relied on his hard skills to pursue life and seek a job: but he knew that this ghostly society did not have a place for him at all. After several setbacks, he deeply felt that relying on skills alone was not enough, so he also wanted to learn how to manage like others, but he was, after all, a hard bone, and he couldn't learn how to serve, flatter, and beg others. He would rather starve to death, so he became even poorer, and then the waves of complaining about poverty often stirred up between the couple.</p>
<p>Kechang was their old classmate. He was a famous playboy in school. Not only did Youshi look down on him, but Ruoyan also often said that he was a double-material dandy, naturally not in his eyes, but after he graduated, relying on his brother being the secretary of the ×× government, he effortlessly followed him and became an official, which proved that he was, after all, the winner in the current society.</p>
<p>When Youshi was extremely poor, Kechang suddenly came to see them with a very lavish decoration, and he was very affectionate and very sympathetic. After he left, Ruoyan thought: "Since he is... why not borrow some money from him!" At night, she discussed it with Youshi, who naturally couldn't object, but nodded unnaturally.</p>
<p>That set Kechang's design: "'What is borrowing some money, just take it!'" So Kechang had more opportunities to visit often, so Youshi's family also became familiar, so, so Ruoyan was already Kechang's lover,</p>
<p>Since Ruoyan told Youshi that she had something to do and had to go to N City, after rolling up her clothes and leaving, Youshi only thought she really went to N City. How could he know that one day he went to ×× Hall to collect manuscript fees, when he suddenly met Yi on ×× Road, holding Kechang's hand, running forward as if flying, simply making it impossible for Youshi to catch up and say: "Ruoyan, you are my lover! How can you walk holding Kechang's hand?" He was disappointed, just standing and staring blankly like a wooden chicken.</p>
<p>Later, I don't know if it was because Kechang lost his job and had no money, or for other reasons, Ruoyan was actually trapped in a brothel like a fire pit. Youshi and a friend went to ×× Road to buy something. It was dusk. They were walking and talking while strolling. Suddenly, a woman came diagonally from across the street and grabbed Youshi's sleeve in a panic:</p>
<p>"Dear Youshi! I am your wife! Ruoyan, please forgive me!"</p>
<p>"What, Ruoyan, I really didn't expect to have the opportunity to meet you again! Alas, unfortunately, you are just my past wife!" Youshi forcefully pushed her hand away.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Lecture <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Yuan</p>
<p>Originally, there was no need to ring the bell. There were only three people in total, so all you had to do was say "The meeting is starting" and that was it. Why ring the bell? But the school seemed to want to show off its authority and had to ring it once.</p>
<p>The principal ran frantically from the library to the playground, and from the playground to the lecture hall, as if not believing that there were only three people listening to the lecture, and still thinking that maybe someone in the library was reading so intently that they didn't hear the bell, or maybe someone was playing so hard on the playground that they didn't hear the bell clearly, so he went around in a circle.</p>
<p>Obviously, everywhere was quiet. The whole school was asleep today 丨 Sunday.</p>
<p>The three of us sat in the third row, there were four people, and another one was the secretary of the school. The principal dragged him over to "fill the scene." I believe that if our Ah Da丨the tea servant wore a long shirt today, he would definitely be pulled over by the principal to "fill the scene" as well.</p>
<p>The door opened, the principal came in, followed by the Dr. × whose distinguished name we had already seen on the bulletin board.</p>
<p>After the principal introduced him, he distorted the facts and said that the number of people listening to the lecture was small because it was probably due to the impact of this unfortunate incident that happened yesterday. Obviously, a three-year-old child would not believe it.</p>
<p>In fact, to be honest, during normal classes, if they were not happy listening to the lecture, these young masters would take advantage of the professor turning his back to write on the blackboard, lower their heads, bow their bodies, and quickly slip out the door. Those young ladies also raised their tiptoes wearing high heels, and let their hips tremble as they rushed out the door as well.</p>
<p>What's more, today is Sunday. Sunday means "play" day. Who would want to sit here stiffly and listen to boring lectures? The school authorities' attempt to open a lecture on Sunday for the purpose of increasing students' knowledge was obviously a failure.</p>
<p>"It's a pity that these students didn't hear such a good lecture, what a pity! What a pity!" After the lecture, the principal's continuous "pities" expressed his great regret for these students.</p>
<p>"It would be best to change the lecture into a dance party, and then people would come." I said to Mr. × after walking out of the lecture hall.</p>
<p>Really, only by changing the lecture into a dance party will people come!</p>

<p>Yesterday, a friend and I ran to Guanglu to see the new American slapstick film "The President's Dream." The day I saw it was the last day, so at least tens of thousands of people have seen this film in Guanglu and Lanxin before me. I now want to express my opinion, together with the people who have seen this film, that it uses politics as the background and a humorous and satirical style to express the possibility of political corruption.</p>
<p>The plot of this film is roughly like this: Four "political brokers" want to promote Blair, a member of a "warlord family," to become president, but Blair lacks the "talent to deal with the world." Later, a medicine seller came to Washington, probably a wandering quack doctor or the like. And he can speak and sing, his actions are funny, and his appearance and movements are exactly the same as Blair's. So the four political brokers wanted to use him as a "gunman" for the presidential election campaign. As a result, he agreed, and toured the country, returning in triumph. Because Blair's White House dream was about to come true, he wanted to get rid of the "gunman." However, because the two of them looked exactly the same, when Blair ordered his henchmen to tie up the "gunman" and send him to a deserted island in the Arctic Ocean, they accidentally tied up Blair himself. And the "gunman," because things had come to this point, was moved by the patriotic heart of "serving the country and the people," and ascended to the position of president.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that a medicine seller becomes president: The saying goes, generals and ministers are not born of special breeds, and men should strive to improve themselves.</p>
<p>Don't you see that cloth sellers and fish sellers in China have been presidents? But using the parliament building as a backdrop and playing the election scene of the national political conference so vividly is a bit of an insult to the dignity of the government. If it were in our China, the person who made this film would be "guilty and deserving of death." Moreover, making revolutionary martyrs, such as Washington, Lincoln, etc., speak and sing from oil paintings is even more absurd and unforgivable. I don't understand how this film passed the American Film Review Board.</p>
<p>When I was in school, I studied political science, and the books clearly stated the drawbacks of the election system in various countries, how to use the special control of electoral districts and various ingenious methods to make an immoral and capable person gradually become the head of a county or a state. But then they justified themselves, saying that the head of a country is not like this, because the people of a country will never allow such a person to hold a position above all the people. This statement is somewhat contradictory, because the people of a state can tolerate an immoral and intelligent person to be their governor, so why can't the people of a country tolerate it?</p>
<p>If you want to be president, then be president, but you don't have to be coy and say how you are serving the country and the people, which is really scolding all the political activists in the world. The big-nosed one is commendable, because he had to find his top hat that could be flattened among many top hats (top hats), and flattened all the top hats that could not be flattened, and the high hat he flattened was put on high, which also has a very profound meaning. Those who stretch will not be able to stretch again: those who bend can bend and stretch at any time: and can defeat everything and let me show off. Wonderful, wonderful.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The Guanglu's "President's Dream" has already passed, and this article is also a bit of "yesterday's news." But because it is not a film review, but an observation of the film from a political perspective. Originally, movies are a tool for unconscious entertainment, and many "scholars and officials" watched movies and went back to talk to their children, so who would be willing to publish their opinions on watching movies in the newspaper? So I published it according to the general rule of "valuing the few." Not smart.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Film Review: Impressions of "Tarzan the Ape Man" <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Young Fellow</p>
<p>"Tarzan the Ape Man," which caused a sensation with its massive advertisements two months ago, has now returned to Shanghai. Because last time it was exclusively for the wealthy class and young ladies and gentlemen, how could a young fellow like me have such an opportunity?</p>
<p>Around four o'clock, I stepped into the new Rong Guang building. In the darkness and among the crowd, I felt my way to a seat. On the screen was projected "A man lying dead in a pile of ivory." So, I waited for it to finish showing and then watched it again. The story is very ordinary, but the majesty of the African wilderness and the tense and dangerous performances, can one not praise and be amazed? Cliffs and precipices, vast oceans, high mountains and ancient trees... what in nature can be more magnificent and spectacular than these? The desperate struggle between humans and fierce beasts and venomous snakes, cruel, savage, dangerous, and perilous, truly makes the audience break out in a cold sweat! Here, we are given an inspiration. It says: In the fierce competition for survival, only those with resistance can survive. Tarzan has a strong body and powerful muscles, which allow him to wrestle with lions and tigers and win; people must also forge a healthy physique and build a strong nation.</p>
<p>The deepest and most stimulating impression I got was the scene "A man lying dead in a pile of ivory" when I first entered the theater. This scene thoroughly reveals the life of someone who risks everything for greed, telling you "How empty is the dream of gold!" The protagonist in the film, for the sake of greed for ivory, took a great risk and went deep into the terrifying jungle, only to find himself exhausted and dying in the ivory pile after achieving his goal. How unworthy is this! You who somersault in the eyes of money, listen!</p>
<p>If you feel that your life lacks a kind of strength, I advise you not to miss the opportunity, go quickly and get what you seek.</p>

<p>— Star</p>
<p>In the era of silent films, although many people ran from the stage to the screen, there was no significant force. By 1927, things were different. The advent of sound in film gave Broadway performers an excellent opportunity. As a result, people from the stage, like a tide, invaded the film industry. The screen's territory was occupied by them by two-thirds. We have witnessed the decline of many silent film superstars! We have also seen the success of many new stars who have just appeared on the screen. But this year, major changes have occurred again! This is probably a huge reverse trend, right?</p>
<p>This year, not only are a large number of new stars running back to the stage from the screen, but even old stars, staff, directors, set designers, and lighting technicians are leaving Hollywood as if they were crazy. Ernst Lubitsch and Cecil B. DeMille have also signed priority contracts with theaters. When their contracts with Hollywood expire, they may direct stage plays. This is truly a great blessing for theater fans and a great misfortune for film fans. Our future opportunities to appreciate their art will be severely threatened!</p>

<p>Tianyi Film Company's "Little Actress," starring Yuan Meiyun, is scheduled to premiere at the Rong Guang Grand Theater at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The opera "Poetry on Banana Leaves," starring Wang Renmei, Li Lili, and others at Tianyi, has now been edited and completed and will be released next month.</p>
<p>Since Tianyi began producing sound films last year, there have been rumors of also producing silent films. However, the company has decided not to pursue silent films because the revenue from silent films in various ports is less than one-tenth or one-twentieth of that from sound films, and will focus exclusively on producing sound films.</p>
<p>"Twin Lovebirds in a Sea of Sin," directed by Shao Zuiweng and starring Hu Shan, Ma Loufen, and Shao Suxia, will be completed soon. The new film starring Liming Hui and written by Liming Hui will begin production soon.</p>
<p>Qiu Qixiang, after completing "Little Actress," is preparing to direct a new film "Pursuit" starring Chen Yumei. Qiu recently went to Beijing to scout locations and returned to Shanghai today.</p>

<p>— Yan Ming</p>
<p>Everyone Asks Him to Put on His Glasses</p>
<p>Rockliffe Fellowes, the world-renowned comedian, arrived in London on the eighth of last month with his wife.</p>
<p>As he walked through the streets of London, many people shouted at him, "Put on your glasses." Rockliffe responded with a smile. A wave of cheers enveloped them. In reality, Rockliffe's large glasses only had frames and no lenses. But they were used to seeing Rockliffe on the screen. Once they saw Rockliffe without his large glasses appearing on the street, they almost suspected he was an imposter. No wonder Rockliffe said: "I often talk to people who have just come out of the movie theater, because they don't recognize me, so they can be as frank as possible with me about what they think. Sometimes they say Rockliffe is great, sometimes they say Rockliffe is not so good."</p>
<p>On the screen, he is a very natural and lively young man. He rarely talks about his art. According to his own thoughts, his best film should be "Grandma's Boy." The most profitable film, however, is "College." But none of his films don't make money, and sometimes even earn 100% of the original cost.</p>
<p>Rockliffe said he plans to make a film in England, but in the near future, he is prepared to tour Paris, Cannes, etc., and then go to Sweden, perhaps even Russia, and then return to England to spend two weeks seeing England, including his grandfather's hometown of Piraeus, which he left at the age of sixteen.</p>
<p>Rockliffe's latest film, "Movie Crazy," will soon be released in this port. In this film, there are many places that cause maniacal laughter, truly breaking the record of his past films.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Film Industry Investigation: The Art League Company Going to Guangxi <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>丨Fifth of the Production Company Visit Notes</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yicuo, the initiator and host of the Art League Company, said: "The Art League means uniting the artistic circles of the whole country to confront foreign capitalists..." This is the Art League's stance. And what are the production plans for the future? Of course, they will also be developed based on its stance. Therefore, the Art League Company, once established, sent all its personnel in a mighty manner to Guangxi, hoping to leave the greatest page in the history of domestic films: at the same time, it also opens up a new path of light for the current domestic films.</p>
<p>The Art League Company's trip to Guangxi to film has received various material assistance from the Guangxi Provincial Government, and they are also boldly preparing to produce things that have never been seen before in domestic films. This is most worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Now, according to the reporter's investigation, the Art League's production plans are reported here...</p>
<p>1.  "Romance in the Yao Mountains" is being filmed on location deep in the mountains inhabited by the Yao people, with Huang Yunhuan, the Yao prince appointed by the Guangxi Provincial Government, as a guide. 2. "Aerial Romance" has obtained aircraft and other assistance from the Guangxi Civil Aviation Bureau, and when the film is completed, it will open a new record for domestic films. 3. "Black General" and "Ism" are two dramas with strong national colors. 4. "Femme Fatale" is a love film filmed with the scenery of Guilin, known as "the best scenery in the world," as the background. 5. "New Guangxi" is a film with a bit of news nature that systematically introduces Guangxi's scenic spots, cultural relics, mining areas, forest reclamation, and even national defense preparations and construction.</p>
<p>Although the above films are still in production, it is not yet possible to determine whether they will be successful or not. However, the Art League's spirit of enterprise and creation is indeed worthy of being recorded in the history of domestic films. And the personnel of the Art League Company who went to Guangxi, in addition to the old figures in the film industry such as Huang Yicuo, Wang Cilong, and Yang Xiaozhong, the rest, such as Xu Manli, Ye Qingqing, Mei Lin, and Luo Mulan, are all newcomers. Now we are here looking forward to the triumphant return of the Art League Company that went to Guangxi丨</p>

<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>The best time to practice your eyesight is when the sun first breaks through the dawn, in the place with the cleanest air. But, never throw the baby out with the bathwater, just because your environment does not allow you to have such a suitable time and place, you dare not practice. No matter how unsuitable the environment is, it cannot stop the poor practice and hard practice of those who are determined and powerless, but there are two things that must be paid attention to. First, you should not practice in places where the air is too unclean. Second, you should not practice in places where the light is too insufficient.</p>
<p>When you first start practicing, it is best to use a pencil and put a small black dot between your eyes, in the center of the bridge of your nose. The place where you stand must be about a foot away from the mirror. (It may be slightly farther.) Stand in the attention position in military gymnastics. Your eyes are directly facing the point in the center of the bridge of your nose. First, exhale as much turbid air as possible from your chest, and then slowly inhale a breath of air from your nostrils. The sound of breathing should not be heard by your own ears. When you start to inhale, count "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight" in your mind. When you count to "eight," you have just finished inhaling a breath of air. When you start counting from "one," your eyes only see the point in the center of the bridge of your nose, vaguely and unclearly. Gradually count to "eight," and the eyesight gradually increases. When you count to "eight," the eyesight has gradually progressed from blurred, level vision to attention.</p>
<p>Hold this breath and attentive gaze. Slowly count from "one" to "eight." Then slowly exhale this breath from your nostrils, starting from "one" and counting to "eight." Finish counting eight words and exhale a breath. When you exhale, your eyesight is also gradually decreasing, from attention, level vision, and gradually falling to a blurred and unclear state.</p>
<p>After practicing once, you may rest for a minute and then practice a second time. Beginners should not practice each style more than three times.</p>
