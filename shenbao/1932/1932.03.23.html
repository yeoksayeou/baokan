<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">目前我國政治上之危機。彬· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自去年七月間洪水之泛濫。與九一八東北禍變突發之震撼。處於凋敝之進程中之中國。乃益陷於黑暗如漆之狀態。至是政府亦已深感焦頭爛額。寖且慮無力打破目前之艱局。而昔日之軍閥官僚政客·以爲國民巳忘其禍國殃民之罪戾。乃欲企圖死灰之復燃。從國難重重局面之下。各攫取一臠。各分得一杯之羹故目前我國死臨到空前之嚴重時期。</p>
<p>中國本爲文化發逹最早之國家近數世纪以來。文化停滯。迄無進步。大多數人民之政治水平綫。尤其低落所謂「不在其位。不謀其政。」「食於人者治人。食人者治於人」之思想。直至目前。猶支配我國大多數人民之頭腦。對於政治抱不聞不問之態度。今日不知明日。今日亦不問明日。但望「天生聖人。爲民之則」但望在位者爲「好人。」爲「賢人。」此種好人政之希望。事實上已爲自袁世凱以來之「個人主義」「軍閥政治」所澈底撃破。</p>
<p>民國十五年。國民黨以有主義。有政綱。有組織。有立塲。有光榮之革命歴史之革政黨。乃代之而興。軍閥政治。乃暫趨於銷沉而代之以政黨政治。政治上亦曾一度放射空前未有之曙光。</p>
<p>迨國民黨革命勢力逹到黄河流河域投機之舊軍閥官僚政客。亦讀遺嘱。談主義。一變而爲國民黨之忠實黨員。如煕洽張景惠之流。竟一躍而爲黨部之指導委員。國民黨中少數領袖。但求彼輩爲已所用。但求表面上得以底定全國。亦一律收容。在此時期。國民當黨在國內政治上旣無復强有力之勁敵於是個人主義乃重新抬頭。頻年以來。一般政治乃漸與人民之利益。背道而馳。軍閥政治與官僚政治。亦緣而復興民困水火。外患遂乘隙而入。故自去年九一八禍變突作。危機乃日益增大。寢至於不可收拾。</p>
<p>令日吾人對於政府。固不忍作過苛之責難。然而在事實上。則目前國難。與未來之出路。事人處此嚴重時機。究將如何乎。其能仍抱「在農言在工言工在商言商」之態度。對於有切膚關係之政治不加過問。坐視舊軍閥官僚政客捲土重來。或其他一般以個人利益爲出發點之政治組織。作種種之活動。以共向現政府要求利益均霑。機會均等乎。令日國內則人慾横流國外則强敵環伺。吾人已臨到最後之時機。周詳考慮。急起救。不復再機不可失。國人其善自處自擇。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Current Political Crisis in Our Nation. Bin. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the devastating floods of last July and the sudden shocking outbreak of the September 18th Northeast Incident, China, already in a state of decline, has been plunged further into darkness. The government is deeply overwhelmed and fears it lacks the strength to break through the current difficult situation. Former warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians, believing that the people have forgotten their crimes of harming the nation and the people, are attempting to revive their power. From this chaotic national crisis, they each seek to grab a piece, to get a share of the spoils. Therefore, our country is currently facing an unprecedentedly serious situation.</p>
<p>China was originally the first country to achieve cultural development. However, in recent centuries, cultural stagnation has occurred, with no progress made. The political awareness of the majority of the people is particularly low. The ideas of "not concerning oneself with affairs outside one's position" and "those who are fed by others govern others; those who feed others are governed by others" still dominate the minds of most of our people. They adopt an attitude of indifference towards politics, not knowing what tomorrow will bring and not even asking about it. They only hope for a "sage born by heaven to be a model for the people," only hoping that those in power will be "good people" and "virtuous people." This hope for governance by good people has been thoroughly shattered by the "individualism" and "warlord politics" since Yuan Shikai.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the Republic [1926], the Kuomintang, as a revolutionary party with principles, a political program, an organization, a stance, and a glorious revolutionary history, rose to replace them. Warlord politics temporarily declined, replaced by party politics. A dawn, unprecedented in its brightness, once shone on politics.</p>
<p>When the revolutionary forces of the Kuomintang reached the Yellow River region, opportunistic old warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians also read the will and talked about principles. They transformed themselves into loyal members of the Kuomintang. People like Xi Qia and Zhang Jinghui even became guiding members of the party headquarters. A small number of leaders in the Kuomintang only sought to use them for their own purposes, only seeking to nominally stabilize the whole country, and uniformly accepted them. During this period, the Kuomintang no longer had any strong enemies in domestic politics. Thus, individualism re-emerged. In recent years, general politics has gradually deviated from the interests of the people. Warlord politics and bureaucratic politics have also revived as a result. The people suffer from hardship, and foreign invasions take advantage of the situation. Therefore, since the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident last year, the crisis has been increasing daily, reaching a point where it is beyond control.</p>
<p>Today, we cannot bear to excessively criticize the government. However, in reality, how should people deal with this serious moment of national crisis and the future way out? Can they still hold the attitude of "speaking about farming in agriculture, speaking about industry in industry, speaking about commerce in commerce," not interfering in politics that is closely related to them, and sit idly by as the old warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians make a comeback, or as other political organizations that start from individual interests engage in various activities to jointly demand an equal share of benefits and equal opportunities from the current government? Today, with human desires running rampant domestically and strong enemies surrounding us externally, we have reached the final moment. We must carefully consider and urgently save the situation. We must not miss the opportunity again. The people of the country should handle themselves and choose wisely.</p>

<p>Decides to Leave Shanghai on the 28th</p>
<p>Possibly Tour Hangzhou Before Heading North to Nanjing</p>
<p>Investigating the Shanghai Incident in Recent Days</p>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth day of the League of Nations Investigation Team's arrival in Shanghai. The representatives have been collecting investigation materials on the Shanghai Incident and soliciting opinions from all sectors of society. They attended a banquet of the Pacific Society in the evening. They also felt tired after visiting the battlefields the previous day. It is reported that they will postpone their departure from Shanghai to Nanjing until the 28th. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e3">Postponement of Departure from Shanghai to Nanjing <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team will postpone its departure from Shanghai until the 28th due to the need to collect more materials, liaise with various sectors of society, and because they felt slightly tired after visiting the war zone the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Directly to Beiping from Nanjing <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The team will stay in Nanjing for four days. The Nanjing side has informed the Chinese representative office in Shanghai via telegram. The team has decided to cross the river and go directly to Beiping after completing engagements with the Nanjing side (staying at the Beijing Hotel). They will not stop in Tianjin to save time.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Possible Tour of Hangzhou <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>According to information from the Chinese representative office, they originally planned to rent a ship for the Investigation Team to travel to Nanjing, but the team may first visit Hangzhou and travel by car on the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway to Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Handling Work in Shanghai <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the League of Nations Investigation Team has tentatively scheduled its departure for Nanjing on Monday (the 28th). Therefore, they plan to complete their work in Shanghai in the next few days, which is to investigate the causes of the Sino-Japanese conflict. They will begin private talks with Chinese and foreign officials and leaders today (the 22nd). They will also consult with the authorities on the Shanghai Incident multiple times this week. The names of the people they will visit have not been disclosed. According to the current schedule, the last consultation will be held on Saturday and Sunday of this week, and then they will rest briefly to prepare for their departure to Nanjing. Whether they will go to Nanjing via Hangzhou or go directly by ship is yet to be determined. Public organizations in Hangzhou have invited the team to visit the city to inspect the ruins of the airfield destroyed by Japanese air force bombing and the damage caused by Japanese aircraft. If they go to Hangzhou, a special train will be prepared for their transportation, and then the National Government will provide cars to meet them on the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway and escort them to Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Impressions of Visiting the War Zone <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, the League of Nations Investigation Team (21st) visited the battlefields of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong and felt that the Sino-Japanese war in these places was comparable to the Western Front in France during the European War. The team spent seven hours inspecting the ruins of the war to get a general impression. Last night, the team stated that they were deeply impressed, and the damage suffered by the area was particularly noted by the members, proving the fierceness of the battle that day. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for the team, their journey did not cover a wide area, and they only visited part of the old battlefields of Zhabei, Zhenru, Jiangwan, and Wusong. However, the members asked many questions along the way, and the accompanying Japanese diplomats and officers answered them one by one. As for what discoveries were made on this trip, nothing was stated last night. A representative of the North-China Daily News asked what impressions were relevant to the work of the Investigation Team. A spokesperson replied that it was difficult to say. The entire route the team traveled had been heavily cleared by Japanese soldiers. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers had been working on this task very busily in the past few days. When the members entered Zhabei, they paid special attention to the North Railway Station. The Japanese representative's explanation of the reasons for the Japanese army's bombing of the station was recorded by the team's secretary. The military events of the first two nights in Zhabei were also studied in detail by the members. According to the team's impression, the Wusong Forts were completely destroyed, and none of the remaining cannons were intact. However, the damage caused by the Japanese air force could not be estimated.</p>

<p>Stating That the Only Way to Prevent War Now is to Return to Defensive Alliances and Armed Peace. The North-China Daily News Geneva telegram of the 2nd states that French person Marin gave a surprising speech here today, claiming that the only way to prevent war is to return to the defensive alliances and armed peace of the past. He also said that the League of Nations' failure to mediate the Corfu incident between Italy and Greece in the past, and the recent failure to mediate the Manchurian dispute, have proven its incompetence.

<h3 id="e9">Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Conference Officially Held Today <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Huang Qiang Will Attend if Ordered by Higher Authority. Huadong News Agency reports that the Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference has revised the three basic principles previously and, with the agreement of both sides, is scheduled to hold a formal meeting at 10 a.m. today. In addition to Guo Taiqi, it is currently undecided who will represent the military authorities on the Chinese side. On the Japanese side, in addition to Shigemitsu, Commander Ueda, Chief of Staff Tashiro, and Chief of Naval Staff Shimada will attend. Representatives of the relevant countries, including British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano, and the counselors of various embassies, will also participate. French Minister Wilden has recovered and may attend. The discussions at today's formal meeting will be based entirely on the League of Nations' peace resolution of March 4, discussing the procedures for ceasefire and troop withdrawal. The issue of security in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Guanbei will be the focus of discussion this morning. It is reported that the Japanese side's opinion is that the security in the troop withdrawal area should be maintained by Japanese police or international police. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated yesterday that this is a kind of propaganda by the Japanese side. If the Japanese side raises it, the Chinese side will resolutely reject it. The Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not release any news yesterday, waiting for the start of today's formal meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Meeting at the Song Residence Yesterday Morning <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference to be held today, the Chinese representative Guo Taiqi held a meeting with Gu Weijun, Song Ziwen, and others at the Song residence at 10 a.m. yesterday to discuss everything. The content of the meeting was not disclosed by Guo and others, only stating that it was a casual discussion with no specific discussions. However, it was decided that if the Japanese side proposes at today's meeting that Japanese police or international police maintain the security of the area where our troops are withdrawing, and proposes the establishment of a neutral zone, our authorities must resolutely reject it, even if it means a breakdown of the peace talks.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Chief of Staff Huang's Talk <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army, told a reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday that the reports that Commander-in-Chief Chiang and himself would attend the Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference were not true, as he had not yet received orders from higher authorities. Therefore, he had telegraphed the central government to inquire about everything. The reply from the central government is expected to arrive tonight. If he is ordered to attend, he will attend and participate. The content of the meeting and how to negotiate have not yet been determined. However, the basis of this meeting is entirely in accordance with the League of Nations' peace resolution of March 4. If the Japanese side exceeds the scope of the League of Nations resolution, we will resolutely reject it. When the reporter asked about the security matters after the Japanese troops withdraw, the Japanese side is promoting that the security should be maintained by Japanese police or international police, with the clear intention of rejecting our country's exercise of sovereignty. If the Japanese side raises this issue, how will we respond? Huang said that this is just a kind of propaganda in the newspaper. We cannot confirm it before the other party officially raises it. However, if the Japanese side disregards public justice and raises it rashly, we will severely reject it.</p>

<p>Declaring His Refusal to Be a Representative at the Ceasefire Conference. Gu Weijun's reply to Ma Xiangbo yesterday read: "Mr. Xiangbo has virtue. It has been a long time since I received your teachings, and I am constantly thinking of you. I have received your letter and respectfully acknowledge your intentions. Your elderly and experienced concern for the country is vividly expressed on the paper. I have read it repeatedly and admire you deeply. Weijun's love for the country is no less than anyone else's.</p>
<p>Throughout my career in diplomacy, my main goal has been to maintain the country and preserve its territory. I hope you understand this. Although the authorities have asked me to be the chief representative at the ceasefire conference in Shanghai, I have repeatedly declined via telegram. I am grateful for your concern and sincere friendship. I hereby reply and wish you peace and well-being. Gu Weijun."</p>
<h3 id="e14">All Sectors of Society Oppose the Signing of Conditions That Would Lose Sovereignty and Humiliate the Country <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Declares. The voices of various sectors of Shanghai have been rising recently. The Chinese nation has always advocated respect for all and equality. Moreover, the citizens of Shanghai, after suffering great pain and trauma, also hope that the war demons will leave quickly. The Federation also believes that the diplomacy of our revolutionary government will not lead to the loss of sovereignty and humiliation of the country. Therefore, at the beginning of the peace talks, we did not want to release aimless arrows, quietly waiting for the good news of the so-called peace. However, the result of the peace talks reported in the newspapers, and the expressions of the diplomatic authorities in Shanghai, not only disappointed us greatly, but also felt that this kind of peace talk was enough to lose sovereignty and humiliate the country. For example, the so-called restrictions on our army's defense area, the Japanese army still being allowed to be stationed in areas adjacent to the concessions, and the organization of a joint committee with representatives of neutral countries to verify the troop withdrawal and maintain security in the troop withdrawal area, not only damage our territorial integrity and political independence, but also violate the spirit of the League of Nations' repeated resolutions and the principle declared by our chief representative Yan at the League of Nations General Assembly that no negotiations will be conducted unless Japan withdraws its troops from Chinese territory. This kind of peace is no different from cession. If we have any conscience, we should know where our interests lie. The Federation, on behalf of the three million people of Shanghai, firmly expresses its opposition and vows to fight to the death to prevent the realization of this kind of peace that would lose sovereignty and humiliate the country. May the country be fortunate, and may the nation be fortunate.</p>

<p>To All Newspapers and Fellow Compatriots. In this disaster caused by Japan to China, many of our brave soldiers and innocent people have sacrificed their lives. This is the most tragic event in our country in thousands of years. If our side agrees to sign conditions that would lose sovereignty and humiliate the country at the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference, our people should unanimously oppose it and refuse to recognize it under any circumstances.

<p>Mayor Wu of Shanghai received a telegram from Chairman Lu of Hangzhou on the 21st, stating that at 10:15 a.m. today, a Japanese plane arrived in Hangzhou, circled over the urban area, and fired shots as a show of force before flying towards Shanghai. In addition to sending a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest, this is also reported to you for your information and to be forwarded to the League of Nations Investigation Team. Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Bao, Ma, Yin [Signature].</p>
<p>A special telegram from Changshu on the 22nd stated that there were no traces of the enemy in the area around Luduqiao, Xintang City, and Fuqiao. A large contingent has gathered at Liuhe. The Japanese warships at Yanglin [missing text] have also left. There are five or six hundred people from Jiangbei dressed in enemy uniforms in Qianjing. At midday today, a Japanese plane came to scout and then flew towards Fushan. The Red Cross is setting out to rescue refugees from Taicang.</p>
<p>A special telegram from Suzhou on the 22nd stated that there are five or six hundred traitors in Japanese military uniforms in Qiwu [missing text] today.

<h3 id="e17">Japanese Airplanes Harass Suzhou <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Foreigners Feel Quite Uneasy. A Letter from Suzhou on the Inspection of the Front Line in Weimen states that the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy have been ordered to come to Suzhou one after another to inspect the positions of our army on the front line. The consuls of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy have completed their tasks and left Suzhou. However, the American Consul Weimen has been investigating in detail and for a longer time. It is said that he has not received orders to return to Nanjing, so there is no definite date for his departure from Suzhou. In the morning of the 20th, when Mr. Weimen went to visit Tiger Hill, he suddenly saw Japanese planes coming to show force. Mr. Weimen immediately used binoculars to observe from the top of the hill and expressed his dissatisfaction with the actions of the Japanese planes. He left the hill at noon and rested at the Garden Hotel. Chen Xin [name], the director of the 19th Route Army rear office, visited and had the following conversation. Chen asked, "How is the recent progress of peace in Shanghai?" Weimen replied, "It is quite hopeful because the political situation in Japan is unstable, coupled with economic difficulties. Moreover, the Chinese volunteers in the Northeast are fighting very hard. It is difficult for Japan to cope with. With all these factors, the peace in Shanghai is quite hopeful. Even if Japan wants to fight again, I am afraid that it will not be able to cope with China's sustained resistance." Chen asked, "You have inspected the front lines of Taicang and Kunshan in great detail. What do you think of the layout of our army's positions?" Weimen replied, "They are very strong and can resist the Japanese army." Mr. Weimen also praised the bravery of the 19th Route Army in battle. At 1 p.m., Mr. Weimen, accompanied by He Shili, the representative of Zhang Xueliang, took a special car to inspect the front line again. However, when the car passed Weiting, two soldiers in the car jumped off without waiting for the car to stop, resulting in serious injuries. Upon seeing this, Mr. Weimen immediately ordered the two soldiers to be rescued and taken back to Suzhou Station for treatment at the Gengsheng Hospital. After they were settled, he continued to drive to the front line. Upon arriving at the destination, he met with Zhao, the Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army, and inquired about the recent actions of the Japanese army on the front line. Zhao informed him that in Xintang City near Liuhe the previous day, the Japanese army set fire to many civilian houses because our residents mistakenly moved the power lines there. In the last three days, the number of Japanese troops landing in Liuhe has increased by two or three thousand. The Japanese army's plainclothes teams also come to our army's positions from time to time. Then Mr. Weimen inquired in detail about the content and organization of the 19th Route Army before taking the car back to Suzhou in the evening. At 7 p.m. that night, American residents of Suzhou, including Xiang Lie, Bai Benli, and Bu Sidun, went to the station to meet with Mr. Weimen. Wu County Foreign Affairs Secretary Huang Shengqing and others accompanied them for dinner at the station. Mr. Weimen inquired about the situation in Suzhou from the American residents in Suzhou, including the number of American residents in Suzhou, the location of scenic spots, and the situation of Japanese airplanes harassing Suzhou. After Xiang Lie and others described it in detail, Mr. Weimen said that the relationship between China and the United States has always been very close and that China is a country that values morality. China's attitude in this incident has been particularly clear and will eventually achieve final victory. Mr. Weimen then went to Nanjing to visit Qixia Mountain on the morning of the 21st and is scheduled to come to Suzhou again that night.</p>
<p>American residents in Suzhou are particularly disturbed by the fact that Japanese planes fly to Suzhou to show force every day, especially on the 19th of this month when Japanese planes flew low over Suzhou for three hours, causing extreme anxiety among the citizens. The American residents believe that since China and Japan are currently conducting peace talks, Japanese planes should not continue to engage in provocative actions. Therefore, they are suspicious of the constant arrival of Japanese planes in Suzhou. On the 20th, 44 American residents in Suzhou sent a telegram to the League of Nations Investigation Team in Shanghai, requesting them to question Japan.</p>
<p>Qiu Qian, from the British company Asiatic Petroleum, has offices, warehouses, and oil pools in Suzhou. He is very concerned about the Japanese planes repeatedly harassing Suzhou. He came to Suzhou from Zhenjiang on the 20th to investigate in detail and returned to Zhenjiang on the 21st. He is preparing to send a telegram to the British Minister Lampson to advise the Japanese side.</p>

<p>Various Provincial Associations in Shanghai have sent letters to the Shanghai-based Provincial Associations, recommending representatives Wang Aoxi, Qiu He, Zhong Hangsu, Li Zhenya, Wang Yusun, Zhang Zhongping, Tan Yagu, Shi Damen, Chu Fucheng, Zhou Boying, Xiao Dexuan, Cheng Xiechun, and Song Shixiang to meet with the League of Nations Investigation Team at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. These representatives, acting on behalf of the people of the entire nation, expressed their opinions and presented the Investigation Team with a formal letter in Chinese, along with a translated draft. The letter is transcribed below.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed League of Nations Investigation Team:</p>
<p>We, the people of various provinces and regions in Shanghai, wholeheartedly welcome your arrival, as you have come to uphold justice in the Sino-Japanese dispute. However, given the current tragic circumstances, we are overwhelmed with the task of providing for the living and burying the dead. Therefore, we have been unable to gather hundreds of thousands of refugees to offer you a warm welcome. Furthermore, we fear that such a sight might cause you distress. If, however, you are willing to seek a more detailed understanding and, in addition to inspecting the war zones, could also visit the hundred-plus refugee shelters to witness the miserable conditions in which our people live, we would be even more grateful.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident of last year, our government, deeply believing in the effectiveness of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, has exercised restraint in the face of Japanese atrocities, awaiting the League of Nations' fair judgment. However, the Japanese military has taken advantage of our unpreparedness to intensify its aggression, expanding from Liaoning and Jilin to Heilongjiang, then to Jinzhou and Harbin, and further encroaching upon our heartland. From Tianjin, Qingdao, and Fuzhou to Shanghai, the Japanese have ravaged nearly every corner of our land. Among our fellow citizens from various provinces and regions in Shanghai, over twenty thousand have been brutally murdered, more than one hundred and sixty thousand households have suffered devastating losses, and property damage exceeds fourteen million. This unprecedented catastrophe is unparalleled in history.</p>
<p>Clearly, Japan has no regard for the League of Nations or any treaty. Although the League of Nations has held numerous meetings, it has failed to exercise its due authority to render a fair judgment. As a result, each resolution has been followed by further Japanese aggression. Our current suffering under Japanese oppression is entirely due to our excessive respect for the League of Nations and our concessions. If there were no League of Nations to maintain peace, we would have defended ourselves with force against Japan's armed aggression, regardless of the world's peace, and we would not have suffered such devastation. Now, because we upheld the League of Nations' prestige and maintained world peace, our territorial and administrative integrity has been violated, and the League of Nations has failed to take decisive action to uphold the sanctity of the covenant. We are filled with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Now, you have come, entrusted by the League of Nations and bearing the mission of justice and humanity, to conduct a thorough investigation of the Sino-Japanese dispute. The future of peace for humanity hinges on your efforts. We earnestly hope that you will adopt an objective stance, use a just perspective, and thoroughly investigate the causes and consequences of the facts, not be blinded by superficial appearances, so as to ascertain the truth and provide a basis for the League of Nations to render a fair judgment. If peace is not undermined by Japan, our fellow citizens from various provinces and regions in Shanghai will be immensely grateful. However, if you fail to conduct a thorough investigation and report inaccurate or incomplete facts to the League of Nations, leading to a judgment that fails to curb Japan's aggressive ambitions, then the League of Nations will lose its credibility.</p>
<p>To uphold world peace, protect the survival of our nation, and promote human justice, we have no choice but to unite the people of the entire country, urge the government to fight Japan to the death, and strive for the freedom of the Chinese nation. Even if this leads to a second world war and great misfortune for humanity, who will bear the responsibility? The world will have its own judgment. As long as human justice endures, there is no reason for the Chinese nation to endure Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>As you begin your mission in China, entrusted with the weighty responsibility of the League of Nations and bearing the earnest expectations of humanity, the fate of peace or disaster rests on your ability to report the facts accurately and the League of Nations' ability to uphold justice. We offer this sincere appeal.</p>
<p>With the utmost respect,</p>

<p>To the Esteemed League of Nations Investigation Team:</p>
<p>Japan has forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces for half a year. The League of Nations has entrusted your esteemed country to investigate in Manchuria. Your esteemed country has spared no effort in traversing land and sea to visit our country in person. Your enthusiasm and goodwill are admired by the world, and the people of our country are especially grateful to you all. Observing the devastation of the Chinese areas of Shanghai, with immense losses in life, property, culture, and economy, one can see that there is a common enemy to all peace in the world today. If it employs its barbaric actions against our country today, it can employ them against other countries in the future. After you arrive in Manchuria, observe its current state to see if it is in accordance with the Nine-Power</p>
<p>Treaty's respect for China's sovereignty, independence, territorial and administrative integrity, and also whether it is in accordance with Japan's repeated declarations of having no territorial ambitions. Your trip is as angels of world peace, and also concerns the survival or demise of the League of Nations. Please uphold justice, thoroughly investigate the surface and the inside of the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, and proclaim the truth to the world in order to jointly plan to restrain the violent and maintain world peace. Although our country has suffered immeasurable sacrifice, the universal principles and civilization of the world cannot be destroyed. The safety of the world depends on your justice and public spirit. We respectfully salute you on behalf of the people of the country, and wish you a healthy journey.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Sichuan Provincial National Crisis Relief Association.</p>

<p>Advocated Implementing Constitutionalism</p>
<p>Yesterday (22nd) at 3:00 PM, Ma Liang, Shen Enfu, Huang Yanpei, Mu Ouchu, and others from the Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association specially convened in the Zhongshe Hall to host members of the National Crisis Relief Association stationed in Shanghai, as well as representatives from various organizations, to discuss the current situation. Chairman Shen Enfu explained the significance of the meeting and invited various parties to express their opinions on saving the nation. Subsequently, Jiang Shaoyuan, representing Ma Liang, expressed his views: (1) The people of the country should unite as one to jointly overcome the national crisis. (2) The government should broadly solicit public opinion and allow the people of the country to jointly overcome the national crisis.

<p>Traffic Gradually Resumes Its Previous Appearance</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the French Concession authorities have spared no effort in maintaining security within the concession. They have placed equal importance on the borders between the Chinese areas and the French Concession and the borders between the British and French Concessions. The areas of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, with the exception of a few key roads opened to facilitate traffic, were all uniformly blocked off. Now, due to the ceasefire negotiations being underway, the French authorities, to facilitate pedestrians, have begun removing some of the barbed wire and defensive structures along the border with the International Settlement since yesterday. Pedestrians and vehicles can pass through. However, the lockdown will still be selectively implemented from 11:30 PM during curfew hours. Nevertheless, residents' movements have become much more convenient.</p>

<p>Gu Zhuxuan, owner of the Tianchan Stage in Shanghai, and lawyer Wang Jishi from Jiangbei have recently noticed that various major and minor newspapers have reported that people from Jiangbei are Japanese spies. They are extremely concerned about this matter and have specifically contacted Song Shixiang, representative of the Yangzhou Shanghai Native Place Association, Cheng Xiechun, representative of the Jianghuai Shanghai Native Place Association, Gu Liangqun, representative of the Tongru Chonghaiqi</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Shanghai Native Place Association to organize a joint office for the three native place associations. The temporary office is located at the Dajiangnan Hotel on Nanjing Road, Shilu. It specializes in providing relief to fellow native place refugees, either accommodating them or assisting them in returning home, so as to prevent them from being used by the Japanese. The reporter visited Mr. Gu and Mr. Wang yesterday. According to them, most of the people from Jiangbei who have come to Shanghai reside in Zhabei. Therefore, the people from Jiangbei have suffered the most in this Shanghai war, and their hatred for the Japanese is also the deepest. Some of those who are used by the Japanese are merely those who have been affected by the war, are struggling to make a living, are greedy for a few cents' wages a day, or have been forced by Japanese violence to engage in hard labor. However, this is only the smallest minority among the fellow native place people, and they are uneducated. It is an exaggeration to say that they are colluding with the Japanese to engage in treason. Moreover, these uneducated coolies have absolutely no qualifications or ability to commit treason.</p>

<p>The joint office of the Shanghai North Business Federation and the various village self-government associations has been working at No. 101 Zhili Road for over a month. They have been especially close to the Zhabei refugees. Currently, many Zhabei citizens have lost their jobs due to the war, and because of face concerns, they cannot go to the shelters and have no home to return to. Their suffering is actually greater than that of ordinary refugees. As a result, many people have approached the office to request relief. The association considers it their unavoidable responsibility and specially convened a joint committee meeting of the two associations on the 17th of this month to organize a relief committee for unemployed citizens affected by the war zone. This committee will be responsible for assisting those relief organizations that are unable to reach them and distributed work and discussed relief measures on the afternoon of the 20th. They also nominated Li Youtang, Chen Yiting, Cai Zhijun, and other committee members to raise funds from all sectors to provide relief.</p>

All expenses are borne solely by Mr. Pan. The shelter is large in scale and well-equipped, with a total capacity of approximately 2,000 victims. Currently, there are only over 700 people.

Last night, the reporter met Mr. Pan, who said that although the shelter was established independently by him, he would be very supportive if anyone was willing to donate voluntarily. However, he would absolutely not seek funds from outside.</p>

<p>Relief for Shanghai Refugees</p>
<p>Team Leader Li Huitang</p>
<p>Chen Ce and Zhang Huichang Donate 10,000 Yuan for Travel Expenses</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, football matches have been suspended. The strong men of the football world have sighed that they have no place to use their strength. Many have devoted themselves to various service organizations to fulfill their duties. The most notable is Cheng Yize, the president of the Youyou Sports Association, who has single-handedly established a refugee relief center and has his members take turns serving there. Now, there is an even more shocking piece of news, which will be a great event in the history of sports in the future. That is, twenty-two national football stars will</p>
<p>form a team and go to the South Sea Islands to raise funds for the relief of Shanghai refugees.</p>
<h3 id="e44">The Process of Preparation <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The motivation for this event arose after the Shanghai Incident. Yu Zhuohua from Hong Kong and Guan Jianan from the Shanghai Customs were running around for this. They gathered talents from all over the world, and finally obtained 10,000 yuan from the two leaders of Guangzhou, Chen Dong and Zhang Huichang, as travel expenses for the team. Thus, the decision to tour South Asia was made. In about a week, the Shanghai players will set off to Guangzhou first for one or two practice matches, and then go to Hong Kong for two or three matches before the whole team departs for South Asia.</p>

<p>This time, there are twenty-two players, which can be said to be a collection of the best in the country. They should be the entire representative of a Chinese football team. Eight famous generals from the sea are also among the selected, such as Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Feng Yunyou, Tu Kaiyuan, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Zhenhe, Li Yichen, and Dai Linjing. Among them, only Mr. Zhou has not yet confirmed, but the rest have all agreed. Guan Jianan, who has been working hard for this matter, originally intended to be the team's doctor, but it is heard that he will serve the 19th Route Army, so it is also difficult to determine his whereabouts.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Goal is 300,000 <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The entire team of twenty-two includes members of two teams. The team leader is Xu Chongqing or Huang Qiming. The coach and administrator is Tang Fuxiang, who has attended the Far East Games as a member of the Chinese football team four times. The captain is Li Huitang and the vice-captain is Zhou Xiangong. Another vice-captain will be appointed by Guangzhou. Mr. Yu Zhuohua will be the team's representative and will first contact the South Sea Islands. If Dr. Guan Jianan does not go, then Tu Kaiyuan will also serve as the team doctor. The entire team will experience fourteen cities, compete in forty matches, and the fundraising goal is 300,000 yuan. The team's entire expenses will be reduced to a minimum, so the goal is not difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>Westerner's Car Blocked</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that, according to the Yangshupu police, another Westerner with a formal Japanese pass was still interfered with by the Japanese Naval Landing Forces. The Westerner was returning to his home in Yangshupu from the French Concession, holding curfew passes issued by the French and International Concessions, as well as a pass issued by the Japanese authorities. The other day, when he was traveling outside the Huangpu Wharf on South Manchuria Road, he was blocked by two Japanese soldiers. It was 1:15 AM. The Westerner showed the Japanese pass, but the Japanese soldiers still refused to let him pass and wanted to search the car. The Westerner refused to turn back because the pass had always allowed him to pass in the past and did not allow them to search. A Japanese soldier then used the butt of his gun to smash the rear window of the car. Two Chinese constables heard the sound and came forward. The Westerner told them what had happened and they reported back to the police station. A Japanese constable arrived in a patrol car. The Japanese constable asked about the situation and reprimanded the Japanese soldiers slightly. Unexpectedly, one of the Japanese soldiers became angry and tore the pass to pieces, throwing them into the air like butterflies. The Japanese constable had no choice but to persuade the Westerner to get into the car and accompanied him home in the patrol car.</p>

<p>According to the North China Daily News, a Japanese man named Okamoto, the son of the owner of a car dealership on Peng Road, has been on trial twice in the Japanese Consular Court in the past four days for allegedly shooting a Chinese man in an alley near the car dealership last week. According to the police testimony, the Japanese man was standing in the alley and saw a Chinese man at the other end of the alley. He then took a .625 caliber automatic pistol and fired a shot at him. The bullet hit the muscle next to him. The police experts collected the shell casing, which matched the description. The injured man has been sent to the hospital, and it is heard that his injuries are minor. The Japanese man has been temporarily released pending further summons.</p>

<p>According to the North China Daily News, a Westerner living near the public swimming pool on Jiangwan Road reported to the police that there were remains of eight or nine Chinese people near his residence. It was claimed that the bodies had been cremated by the Japanese. When a senior police officer was dispatched to investigate, numerous white bones were indeed found, and there was solid evidence proving that the victims' hands had been tied with wire before they were burned. Although the Westerner's residence was flying a foreign flag, it was still used by the Japanese military as a machine gun position, and he had identified one of the dead as his servant. He bought three coffins and collected the remains for burial. It is now suspected that his other servants have also been killed.</p>

<p>Acting as an Agent for Various Agencies, Vessels, False Confiscations Will Be Dealt With</p>
<p>Liang Jiaqian, captain of the Shanghai Public Bureau Water Patrol Team, issued a notice yesterday stating that: In view of the fact that after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, refugees have been displaced and relief supplies have been transported back and forth, various agencies have entrusted the team to urgently hire boats, barges, and small steamers for rapid transportation. Even if the boats and barges are hired, the hirers must pay the workers according to the wages, and there is no forced use. However, the boat owners are not aware of the situation and are still suspicious, leading to rumors of boat confiscation, and even rumors that bribery can avoid it. In fact, there are many employing agencies, not only the team. The team, with policing concerns, will definitely investigate closely and negotiate with all parties to determine the hiring method to facilitate transportation. All barge rentals should be directly negotiated with the Barge Association, which will arrange the rental properly. For the rental of steam and gasoline boats, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will directly rent them. All wages will be paid according to the usual rates. With the introduction of the workers' association and the chamber of commerce, the wages are guaranteed, and there are no other concerns. In the future, the team will not be responsible for confiscating and hiring boats for others, but will only be responsible for protecting navigation. If any team leaders or police officers of this unit, or those who impersonate the name of the unit, are still confiscating ships on the river, all ship owners are allowed to report them nearby, and they will be investigated and punished severely to ensure business and protect shipping. In addition to reporting to the Public Security Bureau for record and distribution, this notice is hereby issued for the information of all boat owners on the Pujiang River. It is also heard that the Pudong Barge Industry has not joined the labor union, so it has sent a letter to the Pudong Native Place Association to separately inform. Regardless of whether it is a government agency, public organization, or group, if ships are needed, the Native Place Association will be notified and immediately arranged to ensure unity and prevent abuses.</p>

<p>Workers in Japanese factories in the West Shanghai area, angered by the unreasonable aggression of the Japanese, have vowed not to return to work in the factories. However, during the period of unemployment, their livelihoods are precarious. Therefore, they wrote a letter requesting assistance from General Zhu Ziqiao of the Flood Relief Committee. General Zhu then sent representative Mr. Jiang Shangqing to distribute rice to the workers in the West Shanghai area according to the name list. A total of 170 dan [a unit of dry measure] of rice were allocated. On the 13th and 14th, 70 dan of rice were distributed at the iron shop at 447 Pinlang Road. Beforehand, the group organized by the workers distributed rice tickets. When distributing rice, the rice was received upon presentation of the rice tickets. A total of 3,535 rice tickets were collected. On the 17th, 18th, and 19th, in addition to the distribution at the above-mentioned location, distribution was also carried out according to the name list at two locations: 3016 Nanfu Li on Roberts Road and 3543 Yinghua Li. A total of 100 dan of rice were distributed, and 5,251 rice tickets were collected. Mr. Chen Wenkui and Mr. Yu Zaichen of the War Zone Refugee Relief Association, six members of the association's ambulance team, and Detective Cui Chengke of the Putuo Road Police Station helped maintain order at the scene. The results were very satisfactory. When the Social Affairs Bureau held the second preparatory meeting for the Unemployed Workers' Maintenance Association the other day, Mr. Jiang also attended and reported on the distribution of rice in the West Shanghai area. Yesterday, the reports in various newspapers about Mr. Jiang's report on the distribution of relief to unemployed workers in Pudong were a mistake. Pudong should have been West Shanghai. This correction is urgently made.</p>

<p>Shen Jiayi, the President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, issued a proclamation yesterday and posted it at the entrance of the court. The text reads: For the matter of proclamation, it is found that civil lawsuits, winning or losing, and criminal lawsuits, whether there is criminal responsibility, all depend on evidence. The court handles cases only based on evidence and considers the law to make judgments, without any room for accommodation. There is no way to manipulate things. The judges and clerks of this court and the Special Zone District Court have been carefully selected and will certainly not be subject to bribery. However, the Shanghai concession is a place where people from all walks of life gather, and people are of various qualities. There are concerns that unscrupulous people may swindle and deceive, or falsely claim to have a connection with a certain judge to influence the case, or impersonate a certain clerk to inquire about information, thereby defrauding people of their property. If the parties concerned are not sufficiently knowledgeable, they are often deceived. Therefore, this proclamation is issued to the litigants. If they encounter the above-mentioned circumstances, they should immediately go to the District Court to report the matter.

(Nanjing) Of the six Japanese warships originally docked in Shimonoseki, three were recalled to Japan last week upon receiving instructions from the Japanese Ministry of the Navy. According to news from the Japanese Consulate, the "Kinu" cruiser currently docked in Shimonoseki is also scheduled to be transferred to Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd. The "Hirado" and "Tenryu" cruisers will remain stationed in Shimonoseki for the time being. (22nd Dispatch) (Nanjing) Since the Japanese Consulate moved its office to the "Yueyang Maru" warship in Shimonoseki, the results of repeated negotiations by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs have only resulted in a small number of ordinary soldiers returning to the consulate office. The Consul-General and Vice-Consul, however, have never entered the city. The Japanese Consul-General, Uemura, recently stated that he plans to move back to the consulate office after the Shanghai conference is successful and both parties have signed an agreement.

<h3 id="e81">Wang Jingwei Discusses Steps for Separation of Military and Civil Administration <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The government has the freedom to consider urgency. (Nanjing) President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei made the following statement to reporters on the 22nd regarding the issue of active-duty military personnel not concurrently serving as political officials: In my policy report to the Second Plenary Session, there was a provision that active-duty military personnel should not concurrently hold the position of local political chief, which should be implemented in stages in the shortest possible period. This has been approved by the Second Plenary Session. This proposition is not my sole opinion, but a voluntary request from a majority of armed comrades who are active-duty military personnel and also serve as political officials, and a similar proposition was submitted to the Second Plenary Session and passed together. However, the so-called "implementation in stages" still gives the government the freedom to consider urgency. This is the caution that should be exercised in the early stages of the separation of military and civil administration. As for the recent so-called "fellow villagers in the capital driving out so-and-so to save the province" and other groups that have petitioned the government and published excessive advertisements in newspapers, they are neither legally established organizations nor follow the proper procedures for petitioning. The harmful effects are significant, and the government will definitely not accept their petitions and should prohibit them. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Reporting on the Shanghai Incident - Distorting the Cause and Effect to Obscure the Facts - Emphasizing the Interests of the Eastern Provinces - Assisting Independence and Manipulating Power - Easing Relations with Russia - Various Outstanding Cases Remain Unresolved - Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: Japanese Foreign Minister Arakawa announced his diplomatic policy in Parliament this afternoon. He spoke at length about the events leading to the Shanghai crisis and the subsequent war. The parliamentarians listened intently. Arakawa said, "At the last parliamentary session, I discussed the more important foreign affairs issues facing Japan. Today, I will report to Parliament on the subsequent developments and state my views on them." The Japanese government, in view of the anti-Japanese movement within China, has taken various opportunities to strongly urge the Chinese authorities to suppress this movement. However, China has ignored this, and the anti-Japanese movement has become increasingly intense, especially in Shanghai. On January 9, the Shanghai Republican Daily published articles that were disrespectful to the Japanese Emperor. On January 18, a Japanese monk and his companion were injured by a Chinese mob. This incident was particularly infuriating to the Japanese residents, as they had been enduring the continuous anti-Japanese movement for a long time, and their patience was almost exhausted after months of hardship. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, acting on instructions from the government, lodged a serious protest with the Shanghai Mayor Wu regarding these two incidents and demanded a resolution. Mayor Wu's response to the first incident was not very different from our demands. Regarding the second incident, the two sides discussed it for a long time. Finally, Mayor Wu also agreed to our conditions. After receiving Mayor Wu's reply on January 28, the Japanese authorities expected progress in the situation and adopted a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting the Chinese authorities to fulfill their promises. At the same time, the 19th Route Army concentrated in the Shanghai area, adopted a menacing attitude, and engaged in preparations for war. The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to prevent disturbances by Chinese troops or civilians in the concession, decided to adopt preventive measures. Therefore, the Municipal Council convened on January 28, declared a temporary state of emergency, and the troops of the powers stationed in Shanghai assumed joint defense responsibilities in various parts of the concession on that day in accordance with the pre-determined joint defense plan. The area defended by the Japanese army was Zhabei. While the Japanese army was deploying in the Zhabei area, the Chinese opened fire. Therefore, the Japanese army was forced to take self-defense actions. According to foreign reports, it seems that the Japanese marines opened fire even after the Chinese side had agreed to the Japanese demands. However, the truth of the matter is exactly as I described it. We have strived to prevent the situation from becoming more serious and have twice agreed to a ceasefire with the Chinese side. However, each time the ceasefire was broken due to the actions of the Chinese soldiers. On February 18, our demand that the Chinese army should withdraw to a certain point was rejected by the Chinese side. Therefore, on February 20, our reinforcements joined the marines to enforce the withdrawal of the Chinese army by 20 kilometers. This task was completed on March 3. After the Shanghai incident occurred, the Chinese government requested the League of Nations Executive Council to invoke Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. This case was later referred to the League of Nations Assembly at the request of China. The Japanese government's opinion is that the Shanghai case is merely a local incident and is not of a nature that could cause a rupture. As for the Manchurian incident, not only have hostile acts not recurred, but the matter has already taken root.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Receiving Important Overseas Telegrams <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to Article 11 of the Covenant, which is in the hands of the League of Nations Executive Council, and the investigation team has also left Europe to investigate all the actual circumstances within China, there is no legal basis for applying Article 15 to both cases. Our government, based on this view, has participated in the discussions of the League of Nations Executive Council and Assembly with an unwavering reservation. On March 11, the League of Nations Assembly passed a resolution, only one point of which was unacceptable to our government. Therefore, our representative, acting on instructions from the government, lodged a protest, stating Japan's theory on the application of Article 15 of the Covenant and refusing to vote. The Three Eastern Provinces occupy a special position in their relationship with China Proper, and the people of the Three Eastern Provinces also deeply resent the warlord regime. Therefore, after the collapse of the government in the Three Eastern Provinces last autumn, the efforts of local leaders to maintain peace and order within the territory gradually turned into a form of autonomy movement. The former provincial governor and other leaders recently announced their independence. The Japanese government received a letter from the diplomatic authorities of the new government on March 12, stating that the new independent state of the Three Eastern Provinces had been established. We took no other action on this letter, but merely acknowledged receipt of the letter in an informal manner. However, if the new state government can, as it declares, truly respect existing treaties and the rights of foreigners, and faithfully abide by the principle of the Open Door, then I am certain that it is in the best interests of the new state. Regarding the various outstanding cases concerning Japanese-Russian fishing rights, negotiations have been continuing in Moscow since last year, but have not yet yielded results. For the sake of friendship between the two countries, we are eager to obtain a reasonably satisfactory resolution. The views of the two governments are now gradually converging, which we are very pleased with. The Japanese government is determined to continue its efforts to achieve all the points it has put forward, so that our legitimate rights under the treaty can be guaranteed. I have briefly described Japan's recent diplomatic developments. From a political point of view, our country's interests in the Three Eastern Provinces are very important, but in China Proper, the Japanese side's rights and interests are all of an economic nature. Therefore, if the Nanjing government and the Kuomintang can abandon their anti-Japanese policy and strive to achieve domestic peace, unity, and economic prosperity, then the friendship between the two countries can be fully restored, without doubt. Furthermore, since the Eastern Provinces incident, especially after the Shanghai situation occurred, the atmosphere in Europe and America has not been entirely understanding towards Japan. This atmosphere is purely due to the Chinese side confusing the facts or other misunderstandings. I firmly believe that the public sentiment in Western countries will gradually lean towards the Japanese side."</p>

<p>Inukai Asks for Parliamentary Support - Japanese Allied Dispatch, Tokyo, 22nd: Prime Minister Inukai's speech in the House of Representatives today, the gist of which is as follows: The government, in view of the major situation, hopes that you will support the urgent national affairs. Because the previous parliament was dissolved, the general budget for fiscal year Showa 7 and various special accounting budgets were not established. It was decided to implement the budget for the previous year in accordance with the articles of the Constitution. However, for the payment of expenses for the Shanghai and Manchurian incidents, which are urgent and unavoidable, a temporary parliament has been convened to submit supplementary budget bills and various important cases such as legal bills. Regarding the China issue, Japan has no intention other than ensuring peace in the Far East, protecting Japanese rights and interests, and the lives and property of Japanese residents. Japan has also repeatedly declared that it has no territorial ambitions and respects the principle of the Open Door and equal opportunity. The current relationship between China and Japan is extremely complex, but if China can take practical steps towards reflection, then its resolution is not difficult. The government sincerely hopes that the relationship between China and Japan will be restored to its original state as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Army Minister Araki States: The Significance is Even Greater Than the Russo-Japanese War - Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: Army Minister Araki said in a speech to Parliament today that the situation in Manchuria is far from being stabilized, so attention must still be paid to it at all times. The peace of Manchuria, from the point of view of national defense, is indeed extremely important to Japan. Therefore, the Japanese troops currently stationed in Manchuria must still be maintained, and if possible, they should even be increased. This matter is currently under consideration by the authorities. Araki also detailed the military developments in Manchuria and Shanghai and solemnly declared that the magnitude of the issues involved and their impact on Japan, in certain respects, are even more serious than the Russo-Japanese War. According to the opinions of those observing the situation, Araki's strong advocacy for maintaining the current combat strength of the Japanese troops in Manchuria is aimed at permanently stationing about three divisions in Manchuria, instead of stationing only one division as before September 18 of last year.</p>

<p>Japanese Troops Concentrated on the Middle East Railway Line - Hirota Claims the Purpose is to Protect Japanese Residents - Reuters, Moscow, 21st: Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Hirota, in response to the interrogation by Soviet Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan, stated that the Japanese troops in the Kwantung Peninsula are currently closely monitoring the activities of the White Russians and are prepared, if necessary, to stop political activities against Soviet Russia. Hirota mentioned that the new government of Manchuria has repeatedly stated that Japan abides by the principle of the Open Door and denied Karakhan's claim that the actions of the Japanese troops are destroying the Portsmouth Treaty. He stated that the transportation and concentration of Japanese troops on the Middle East Railway line is for the purpose of protecting life and property and has no strategic purpose. Japan is determined to abide by the provisions of the Portsmouth Treaty, and Japan has no intention of stationing troops on the Middle East Railway line. Hirota then inquired with Karakhan about the concentration of Russian troops on the Russian-Korean border and the construction of an airfield there. Karakhan replied that all such rumors are groundless.</p>
<p>Havas, Riga, 21st: Latvian General Ponzewicz published an article in the Segonia newspaper (a Russian newspaper in Riga) on March 18, stating in brief that Moscow has recently been paying unusual attention to the events in the Far East. Japan wanted to use the Middle East Railway to transport Japanese troops and had consulted with Soviet Russia, which is a well-known fact. In the last six months, Soviet Russia has increased its troops in the Far East and transferred the 26th Division of Krasnoyarsk, known as the Stalin Division, to Spassk, north of Vladivostok, and moved the staff offices of the 18th Army and the 35th Shooting Division from Irkutsk to Chita. As for the newly organized technical teams in the coastal provinces and their various means, which are not published in newspapers, they are not included. From these various things, it can be seen that Soviet Russia is prepared to defend its interests along the Pacific coast, and the northern part of the Middle East Railway is particularly important to it. If this section of the railway is abandoned, then Vladivostok and the Great Peter Bay will inevitably be lost. The Soviet Union began developing this bay in 1920, and the cost has already been considerable. How can it be handed over willingly? Havas, London, 21st: A member of the House of Commons proposed that the League of Nations should investigate the situation of Soviet Russian military preparations. The Foreign Secretary replied that the League of Nations cannot undertake any investigation within the territory of non-member countries unless requested by the country.</p>

<p>Rescued by Passing Fishing Boat - Trip to Czechoslovakia Cancelled - Reuters, Constantinople, 21st: Exiled Russian figure Trotsky, accompanied by two friends, was sailing on a steamer in the Sea of Marmara when the weather changed unexpectedly. A strange wind rose suddenly, and the boat struck a reef. Trotsky and his two friends abandoned the boat and landed on a deserted island called Dog Island. The three men spent the night outdoors, suffering from the cold. They were rescued this morning by a passing fishing boat. Trotsky had originally intended to go to Czechoslovakia for rest, but the Turkish government could not guarantee that they would not be hindered from returning to Turkey in the future, and the Czech government also withdrew its previous permission for him to enter the country. Therefore, Trotsky has now cancelled his trip to Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 21st: The Soviet Russian government announced today that the passports of Trotsky's entire family and several of his associates have been cancelled. Henceforth, these people will be stateless. Even if they obtain the nationality of another country and re-enter Russian territory with a new passport in the future, they will be immediately arrested.</p>

<p>国民社 (Kuomin News Agency) 21st, New York Dispatch: A sudden severe storm occurred in central Alabama today, causing extremely heavy damage. According to the latest reports, 106 people have died and 250 have been injured. However, officials fear the number is even higher, as transportation to the area has been cut off and detailed reports from various locations have not yet been sent. The area with the most severe damage is Northport, where houses collapsed when the wind struck, followed by fires. Due to a lack of rescue efforts, many women and children died. Some corpses were hanging from treetops, while others were buried in ash and soil, making the scene particularly tragic.</p>

<p>Nanjing Dispatch: To all Newspaper Offices: We have telegraphed the League of Nations in Geneva, stating that since the Mukden Incident, the people of our Northeast have been groaning under Japanese violence for over half a year. Recently, they have even resorted to their old tricks of annexing Korea, instigating rebels to organize a puppet Manchurian government, and falsely claiming it comes from popular will, hoping to confuse the world. Your esteemed organization has now sent an investigative team to the East. With their cunning and deceptive schemes, they will certainly be able to accurately report the truth to the General Assembly to expose the true situation to the world. We hope that all of you will uphold justice, maintain the integrity of our territory, relieve our people from their suffering, and fulfill the League's mission of protecting peace. As for the puppet Manchurian government, organized under Japanese coercion, not only do the people of the Northeast vow to oppose it to the death, etc. We respectfully telegraph this plea with utmost urgency. The same message was also sent to the League of Nations Investigative Team, so we will not repeat it. The rebellious actions of the puppet state, a puppet of violent Japan, are obvious. We hope everyone will oppose it unanimously, with utmost anticipation. The Northeast Residents in Beijing National Salvation Association bows its head.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Japanese Political Parties Present Dissolution <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Internal Split of the Seiyukai - Foundations of the Minseito Shaken - Masses Party Opposes Reorientation</p>
<p>Seiyukai: The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reports that the resignation of Education Minister Nakabashi is gradually leading to a major split within the Seiyukai. Currently, the Suzuki faction, the Kuhara faction, and the Tokonami faction are in opposition and conflict, intensifying their mutual infighting. The opinions of the Seiyukai's members are extremely divided. The Kuhara faction's cadres believe that the Minister of Justice Suzuki's transfer to the position of Minister of the Interior was a conspiracy by Education Minister Hatoyama and Chief Secretary Mori, and they are determined to propose an impeachment motion when the Diet convenes. Thus, the Suzuki faction and the Kuhara faction are already irreconcilable. Meanwhile, the Tokonami faction will join the Kuhara faction to oppose the Suzuki faction. As a result, the cabinet members are in a state of division, with Minister of Justice Suzuki, Education Minister Hatoyama, and Chief Secretary Mori opposing Minister of Railways Tokonami, Minister of Commerce and Industry Maeda, and Minister of Communications Mitsuchi. Others, such as Finance Minister Takahashi and Minister Yamamoto, also show a slight anti-Suzuki attitude. It is expected that a major conflict between Kuhara and Suzuki will erupt in the Diet in the coming days, and Prime Minister Inukai still insists on Suzuki's succession as Minister of Justice, the crisis of the Seiyukai's partial collapse can be seen immediately. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that Prime Minister Inukai often does not consider the importance of matters at home and abroad, arbitrarily recommending his trusted individuals as cabinet members, leading to dissatisfaction within the Seiyukai and causing infighting among the factions. This proves that President Inukai lacks the ability to control the political party, and the cabinet's fate is as precarious as a castle built on sand.</p>
<p>Minseito: The Kokumin Shimbun reports that President Wakatsuki, in view of the party's unease and shaky foundation, is actively seeking to recruit party members. Recently, he has tried to persuade General Ugaki to join the party and has also tried to get the Adachi faction back. However, Ugaki's joining the party is strongly opposed by the Adachi faction, and the central cadres of the Minseito also disagree with Adachi's return. Only the Adachi faction members within the party and the cadres below who received Adachi's assistance during the recent general election are enthusiastically promoting Adachi's return. Therefore, the Minseito has been split into three factions: the status quo maintenance faction, the Ugaki faction, and the restoration faction. The opinions of these three factions are complex and chaotic, each faction is extreme, and they are all plotting to establish a new party. Wakatsuki insists on maintaining the status quo, but the internal turmoil of the Minseito is already on the verge of crisis.</p>
<p>Labor-Farmer Masses Party: The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reports that after five cadres of the National Labor-Farmer Masses Party submitted an opinion advocating a reorientation towards national socialism, the standing executive committee convened at the party headquarters on the 14th to report on the situation of the National Labor Union and the Niigata Prefecture Federation of All Farmers, and to discuss the aftermath. Party leader Aso and all the cadres stated that the present is a period of reaction, and they insisted on adhering to the party's principles of overthrowing imperialism and vehemently opposing war, resolutely opposing the reorientation towards national socialism. The entire assembly unanimously agreed to expel Genji Mochizuki, Tōbun Hanawa, Seiichi Imamura, and Zenzo Iwanai, etc., five people who submitted the paper for reorienting to National Socialism, and in order to respect democratic ideals, it was decided to convene a central executive committee on the afternoon of the 23rd to determine the party's platform. Therefore, a major storm is bound to occur at that time, and the signs of a split in the Masses Party are gradually being exposed.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Japan and the Puppet State Will Conclude a Treaty <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>First Step is to Conclude Treaties on Agriculture and Commerce etc. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that although the Japanese government is currently observing the sentiments of various countries, it will soon formally recognize Manchuria as an independent country. Meanwhile, it will substantially and directly begin negotiations on various issues. Therefore, in the shortest possible time, it will conclude a comprehensive treaty with the Manchurian government to fundamentally renew relations between Japan and Manchuria. To establish its national foundation, Manchuria cannot achieve its goals without the assistance of the advanced nation of Japan. Japan plans to first conclude agricultural contracts, commercial treaties, and other important treaties with Manchuria.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Establishment of the Puppet Dynasty <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Xiaoxu and Others Perform the Three Kneelings and Nine Prostrations - Each Ministry Has a Nominal Title But No One to Handle Affairs: A dispatch from Harbin states that the puppet show of the establishment of the puppet dynasty in Changchun has already closed. How it will be staged in the future depends on how the puppeteer behind the scenes manipulates it. Pu Yi arrived in Changchun at 3:00 PM on March 8, accompanied by Zang Shiyi, Zhao Xinbo, Zhang Jinghui, Zheng Xiaoxu, and Luo Zhenyu. Ma Zhanshan, Xi Qia, Jin Biedong, and dozens of puppet officials welcomed him. Pu Yi first entered the puppet Senate, which was converted from the Tax Transportation Bureau. The Japanese army was extremely vigilant along the way. The Changchun County Government forced the populace in advance to hold flags and cheer "Banzai!" under the coercion of the military police. At 3:00 PM on March 9, the inauguration ceremony was held at the puppet executive office (the executive office is located in the municipal planning office). Zhang Jinghui kneeled and presented the golden state seal, and Zang Shiyi rushed to present the government seal. Zheng Xiaoxu was the first to perform the three kneelings and nine prostrations, followed by Xi Qia, Zhang Jinghui, Zang Shiyi, Zhao Xinbo, and Ma Zhanshan, who knelt together. The remaining twenty or so puppet civil and military officials knelt together. The ceremony was just like the Qing system, only lacking the prostration on the golden steps and shouting "Long Live!" After the puppet civil officials paid their respects, Kang Yasuya Uchida, President of the South Manchuria Railway, visited on behalf of the Japanese side and delivered a congratulatory speech. The ceremony lasted about an hour. After the ceremony, Miyake, the Japanese Staff Officer of the Kwantung Army, presented the Japan-Manchukuo alliance treaty, which was signed by the puppet regent. At 10:00 AM on the 10th, the inauguration ceremony for the puppet officials was held, and the personnel of the puppet government were announced as follows: Chief of Staff of the Executive Office Zhang Haipeng, Attending Military Officers Ai Naifang and Jin Zhuo, Chief Civil Officer Bao Xi,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Premier of the State Council Zheng Xiaoxu, Minister of Civil Affairs Zang Shiyi, Vice Minister Bao Kang, Minister of Military Affairs Ma Zhanshan, Vice Minister Wang Jingxiu, Minister of Foreign Affairs Xie Jieshi, Minister of Finance Xi Qia, Vice Minister Sun Qichang, Minister of Industry Zhang Yanqing, Minister of Transportation Ding Jiansiu, Minister of Justice Feng Hanqing, Speaker of the Senate Zhang Jinghui, Vice Speaker Tang Yulin, Senators Zhang Haipeng, Yuan Jinkai, Luo Zhenyu, and Huang Fu, President of the Supervisory Yuan Yu Chonghan, President of the Legislative Yuan Zhao Xinbo. Zang Shiyi, Xi Qia, and Ma Zhanshan are appointed as the governors of the three provinces of Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. On the morning of the 12th, the first puppet state council meeting was held to discuss the borrowing of 20 million yen from Japan, the conclusion of a new treaty, and requesting Japan to recognize various matters. It was also decided to rename Changchun as the capital, establish a capital garrison headquarters, appoint Deleng'e as the commander, and establish a police superintendent, appointing Tong Changyu, chief of the Jilin police department, as the superintendent. Although each ministry has a name, there are no personnel to handle affairs. It is just a Japanese propaganda stunt that is very serious. It has now been decided that the military administration department will be located in the clothing factory, the transportation and industry departments will be located in the Ziqiang School, and the justice department will be located in the Daosheng Bank. It is planned to spend 10 million to construct the addresses of the puppet capital's ministries and courtyards, but funds can only be allocated after the loan agreement is finalized. Within days, Foreign Minister Xie Jieshi will issue a statement to the outside world in the name of the puppet government, in order to test the atmosphere of various countries. Before the great powers show any indication, the Japanese side pretends not to hear and does not recognize it first. However, the majority of the people in the Northeast are extremely indignant at the establishment of the puppet dynasty, so they hope that the central government will quickly issue an order to suppress it.

<h3 id="e119">Black Army Rises Up Against Ma <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Third Brigade Declares Independence in Heihe - Cheng Zhiyuan Refuses to Cooperate with Ma - Su Bingwen Raises the Standard of Righteousness in Manchuria: A dispatch from Harbin states that since Ma Zhanshan defected, his subordinates have expressed their resistance one after another, such as Cheng Zhiyuan, Su Bingwen, and a certain regiment of the Third Brigade stationed in Heihe. On the morning of March 10, the regiment raised the flag against Ma, organized the National Salvation Army, and expelled its regimental commander. However, one company of soldiers, incited by the regimental commander, opposed the move and was surrounded by the majority of the troops. A street battle broke out for an hour, and the company was resolved, and the regimental commander escaped. Order was restored in the city streets in the afternoon. The defense corps and police from various towns near the Heilongjiang River acted in unison with the army. Cheng Zhiyuan, commander of the Eighth Cavalry Brigade, seeing that the Heihe garrison was anti-Ma, believed that they shared the same aspirations, so he led his entire brigade of soldiers to Heihe on the 12th, hoping to demarcate and manage the area along the border and not cooperate with Ma Zhanshan. Cheng's troops are the basic force of Ma's army. Su Bingwen, the Commander of the Heilongjiang Army's Railway Protection, led the Second Infantry Brigade along the Boketu station directly to Manchouli and Zhalainuoer, with a force of about 7,000. Su is one of the most forward-thinking generals in the Heilongjiang Army. His anti-Ma action had been brewing for many days, and it finally erupted on the 13th of this month. A regiment of Su's troops stationed in Manchouli opposed the celebration of the puppet state's construction held by the local municipal bureau as early as March 5. Li Jianwen, the chief of the municipal branch, relying on the assistance of the Japanese consulate, continued to proceed as planned. Su's troops then arrested him as a traitor. At the same time, in Hailar and Boketu, all Su's troops stationed in the area prohibited the celebration of the puppet state. At 5:00 AM on the morning of the 13th of this month, when Su's troops announced their anti-Ma stance, Su's troops in Manchouli mobilized the entire town, demonstrating along the streets, shouting slogans such as "Down with the puppet state!" and "Down with the traitor Ma Zhanshan!" Sentries were posted on each street, and a volley of live ammunition was fired next to the railway factory to express their thorough opposition to the puppet state and Ma Zhanshan. The shops, unaware of the details, closed their doors. Fujii Kengo, a Japanese store owner at the Asahi Shōten, insisted on breaking through the line of troops to go to the Japanese consulate during the troop demonstration and was shot and killed. Other Japanese were terrified and rushed to the Japanese consulate. By the afternoon, order was restored, and the Japanese residents urgently telegraphed Lieutenant General Tamon, commander of the Second Division of the Japanese Army in Harbin, saying that the area around Manchouli had become unstable and that the Chinese army in Hailar and Boketu would riot, and that troops must be sent quickly to protect the residents. Tamon had already agreed. Then Honjo Shigeru arrived in Harbin by plane from Liaoning at noon on the 14th, and a meeting was held immediately. It was deemed impossible to send troops to Manchouli. If necessary, the Japanese army stationed in Heilongjiang may be ordered to send a portion to Hailar. Honjo also learned that Ma Zhanshan had arrived in Harbin from Changchun, so he urged Ma to return to Heihe immediately and plan ahead, so that a peaceful solution could be used to persuade Su Bingwen to cancel his resistance. Ma returned to Heihe in a hurry on the afternoon of the 14th, while Honjo planned to go to Heihe by plane on the 15th. It is said that the Japanese side did not dare to send troops to Manchouli immediately because Soviet Russia has been actively purchasing military supplies in northern Manchuria in the past week and transporting them in large quantities to Chita. Soviet Russian newspapers also said that the Japanese side was assisting the White Russians to seize the Russian territory of the Far East, so the Military Commission sent General Burykhailov (i.e., Galen) as the Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army in the Far East. He arrived in Vladivostok a few days ago and gave a speech to the Red Army, saying that imperialism was attacking Soviet Russia, and the Red Army should prepare everything and make them suffer badly. The Japanese side, of course, knew what it meant, so it did not dare to send troops to Manchouli directly to avoid a head-on conflict between Japan and Russia. As for the Jilin Self-Defense Army led by Ding Chao and Li Du, they are stationed in counties such as Fanggheng, Shiqing, and Mishan. Xi Qia is still begging the Japanese army to help resolve the situation, but eastern Jilin is deep in the mountains and forests, and the Japanese army has no courage to advance in this way. Therefore, the headquarters of the Kwantung Army plans to send Doihara to coordinate with Xi Qia's representatives Li Guilin and Zhang Shu within the next few days to persuade them to surrender. The meeting place is scheduled to be in Zhuhe County on the Hasui Railway. Li and Ding replied that they have agreed to talk as a temporary measure. (14th)</p>
