<h3 id="c1">一九三二年世界之展望彬· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>殘酷的事實。已經澈底擊破國際資本主義永遠維持其壽命永遠，保持其繁榮的幻夢了。世界正向一個動蕩不安·騷亂·恐怖的局勢·以加速的步武邁進着。同時也正是向另一個新的光明的和平幸福的宇宙大踏步前進着。過去了的一九三一年已經爲我們證明了這理論是千眞萬確。而時間波流上新的符號。一九三二年則又恰爲表示使此一理論成爲事實的時日已日益接近。在一九三二年的開頭。我們對於世界的展望。至少可以作這樣一個類乎預言的推斷。</p>
<p>然而這預言一點也不狂誕滑稽。因爲一九三二的世界必須依照着「因果鐵律」而展開。</p>
<p>過去了的一九三一年。究竟爲未來世界種下了一些什麽「因」呢。</p>
<p>第三時期的資本主義的恐慌。已經擴大深刻到極度。農業的凋敝。工業的衰落。原料的困乏。海外贸易的减退。社會購買力的降低。失業羣衆的激增。生產的過剩。影響而爲股票的跌落。銀行信用的動搖。進而形成爲日益擴大深刻化的金融恐慌。由奥而德而英進而直接予金元王國的華盛頓合衆國底金融市面以鉅大的威脅了。在去年中。地方銀行相繼破產倒閉的有八百餘家。自一九二零年來倒閉銀行總数則達七千家左右。十月七日至十月十五日紐約聯邦銀行一再下令提高貼現至百分之三·五。但現金流出之狂潮。却並未因而得以遏制。從九月十七到十月十五日星期中聯邦銀行已損失現金至六萬五千萬美金之鉅。在深刻化的恐慌中。英國的金本位廢止了。瑞典梛威諸國的金本位也廢止了。東亞的日本也因之而實行金再禁了。胡佛緩付戰債的計劃。竟未能紆解歐洲經濟的苦悶。以避免自已将要遭受的困厄。而且由於經濟恐慌之深刻。政治的恐慌。也因而加深了。德國大選舉。國粹黨之勝利。英國國民政府之成立。日本政友會内閣之重新登台。在右傾的國際政治情勢之下。更加强了左傾势力之對立。整個國際資本主義。已經陷於十分苦悶艱難的窘境了。一切的資本家都困入十分迷惘憂慮的棼圍了。正如開尼斯所説。「我們今日陷入無救的迷圍中。因爲我們在處理一架靈活的機器（資本主義的經濟機器）時、著着是迷誤了。這架機器的規律。我們一點也不了解」。又如美國金融資本的最大領袖拉蒙底同事所説。「我們以前一切科學的研究。在於給世人指示出。他們怎樣才可以阻止工業運行底這種過度的發達。這研究是失敗了」。礭實的。這研究是宣告失敗了。</p>
<p>德·奥·英·法·美·以至整個資本主義體系下的國家。没有一國不爲恐怖的不景氣所籠罩。簡直没有一國能夠例外。爲要説明其恐慌深刻化的程度。我們且舉遠東的日本做一個例證。</p>
<p>以農產物價的暴落而言。千葉縣地方的菊花都大批的焚燒了。神奈川的田中貼有「請隨便拿蘿蔔去」的揭示。大阪的中河内那地方運野菜到市埸去賣。連運費也賣不到手。大家都興起不如援助同盟罷工的念頭。以農村負債而言。巳達五十億元以上。以失業羣衆而言。亦已達到二百萬以上。以勞働爭義而言。自去年一月至八月已發生一四七八件之多。較前年同期增加了百分之二三。以海外貿易而言。自九一八以後對吾國損失已達一億五千萬元。以銀行倒閉而言。自今年一月至八月休業銀行達十五家。以國家財政而言。本年度預算經極度之削减。仍不足一億二千萬元。整個社會陷於不景氣的深淵。大衆生活日益惡化。就此一例。不是已足</p>
<p>以窺見整個資本主義經濟動搖崩潰的情勢之全豹了嗎。</p>
<p>正以資本主義危機之深刻擴大化。所以新的世界戰爭危機。也日益迫近。每一個帝國主義國家。都竭盡全力計劃並進行着新戰爭的準備。</p>
<p>新的戰爭是爲着重新分割市塲。爲着爭奪煤油煤鋼鐵水電力橡皮棕樹等重工業上所必需的原料。爲着擴大資本底剝削。爲着保障過去的投資。爲着鎭壓動搖中的殖民地。英倫政府停止了金本位。减低了產品的價格。正沿着海路加緊推進其海外貿易。企圖恢復其資本主義先進國的光輝。然而這一事實。恰與金融資本王國丨美利堅隨時隨地發生正面的衝突。同樣日本也正站在這一事實的正面。在太平洋上形成了一個三角形的角逐。在歐洲爲着爭奪歐洲大陸的覇權。及地中海與非洲殖民地。英與法。很顯明的對抗着。爲着爭奪地中海商業路綫。爭奪北非洲及亞洲殖民地與勢力範圍。法和意對抗着。各個資本主義國家間各以利害的關係而尖銳地對立着。經濟壁壘（關稅）的對立。已是不必說了。而在戰爭準備上的對立。事實上亦日益顯明。</p>
<p>目前世界六十個國家。用於軍備的費用。共達四、一五八、○○○、○○○金元。已多於戰前所費。美國居第一。法居第三。英居第四。其次爲意爲日。胡佛氏估計各國數字之總和。或較多於戰前者百分之七十。又據國際年鑑之報告。一九三○年内於經濟破產籌措匪易之際。關於軍費之同涂已增加一○○、○○○、○○○金元。而各國的武器。則亦日益努力集中於「火力增加」「機械化」「航空勢力增大」「化學準備戰」四點。這些事實是説明了什麽。不是説明了新的戰爭將成爲無法避免嗎。德國軍事部總長格倫湼爾曾説、「未來的戰爭。只是時間的問題」。這句話。眞是「一語破的」。</p>
<p>九一八在我們國家的東北角上。已經發放了一個號砲。今年美國的海軍大操。乃是在太平洋上。這些事實。大家都不會忽視罷。</p>
<p>可是。在這裏我們却不要忽略了另一方面的事實。在資本主義的系統之下。在整個凋敝世界的圈外。却有一個蘇聯正在建設的前途邁進着。蘇聯經過一九一七至一九二一年的戰時共產主義（極左政策）時代。及一九二一至一九二八年的新經濟政策）左傾緩和政策（時代。漸已由今日之經濟復興而轉入社會主義化。一九二八年開始實施的五年計劃。在今年九月末即將完成。而且新的五年計劃又已確立。他恰站在苦悶的世界以外。用冷靜而樂觀的態度。等待着一個機會根本予這苦悶的世界以破滅。她的軍費在世界上高列在第二位强大的陸軍和新式的軍事上的設備。都足以給予國際帝國主義者以强大的威脅。有蘇聯的存在。國際帝國主義者一天不得安枕。同時帝國主義勢力一日不消滅。蘇聯的活動也一天未得終了。更加以各個資本主義國家國内社會運動之激化。各國殖民地半殖民地獨立運動之激化。這裏又形成另一個意義的對立。這對立的日益尖鋭。改換世界面目的戰爭。也正等待時日而突然展開。</p>
<p>資本主義國家間第二次大戰的爆發。將使全人類陷入更悲慘的地獄。永永不得翻身資本主義與社會主義的戰爭之爆發。將爲戰爭兩字之根本消滅。將改新世界而指示人類以光明的樂園。這兩種各異其質的戰爭。都在加緊準備着。都在一九三一年所種的「因」下推進着。一九三二年只是在時間上説明了這準備與推進的工作。又已進到一個新的境域。大時代的來到。已依稀可以望見。</p>
<p>世界將有一個澈底的變動了。在變動的過程裏。中國是處一個無可逃避的承受各種勢力之震撼的地位。中國應該怎樣呢。這裏我借用兩句話。</p>
<p>「不久將要來到一個時期。使我們要根本决定站在此方面。或彼方面的問題」</p>
<p>中國是站在此方面呢。是站在彼方面呢。還是站在洶湧澎湃的中流。聽天由命的順受時代洪濤之衝激呢。此時應該决定了罷。</p>

<p>今日爲一九三二年之元旦。而和平统一之新政府。亦於今日宣吿成立。在</p>
<p>一年之關端。成立新政府。實具有特殊意義。至足供我人民與政治領袖默念深思。</p>
<p>除舊佈新。萬象更新。此吾人之所以深致欣愉慶祝希望之忱於新年也。同時吾人今日於新政府之统一和平之實現。其欣愉其慶祝尤爲加重。而其希望則尤爲倍切。何也。歲月流水。未來之新年。正復無窮。而新政府之成立。及其今後之施政。則爲今日我國家民族生死存亡之所繫。最後之時機。稍縱即逝也。</p>
<p>在今日所陳現於新政府當前之問題。第一爲如何以禦外侮。第二爲如何以安内。自九一八以迄今茲。歷時將四閲月。在日人策動之下。聞遼吉失地。亦將於今日易幟。半壁山河。任人宰割。而遼西鼙鼓。復動地而來。暴軍西進。錦州吿危。此迫我日急之强宼。究將如何以抗禦。遼吉失地。究將如何收回。此一問題。迫在眉睫。無可迴避。故如何以禦外侮。實爲新政府急應籌謀者一。去年水災。幾偏全國。洪流所經。荒凉一片。農業破產。人民流離。民生塗炭。元氣喪盡。不僅災區。以國家生産之落後。社會經濟日趨於腐朽破落。農產衰落。農民日以離田。工業凋敝。工人日以失業。全國失業人數。幾至無可數計。失業愈多。而「匪盜」之勢乃愈如火燎原。不可嚮邇。社會秩序全部紊亂。人心惶惶。不可終朝。此一問題。亦緊迫在新政府之目前。究如何以改造社會經濟。如何以解除人民困厄。如何以安定社會秩序。亦爲今日新政府所急應籌謀者又一。吾人認爲對外必須貫澈打倒帝國主義一政策之决心。始足以言禦侮與抗暴。對内必須以痛苦大衆之利益爲前提。始足以言安定秩序。否則以言對外。前虎方拒。後狼又來。圖賴國聯。終難自救。以言對内。悖乎大衆之利益。即爲增加大衆之疾苦。痛苦之極。人皆思亂。秩序乃以欲使其安定而愈以紊亂。社會經濟乃以欲使其復興而愈以衰落。或其不然。而爲由國際之經濟共管。進而爲政治之共管。亦足使我國家眞實殖民地化。陷於永遠末可自拔之深淵。故新政府對於此兩個迫於目前之大問題。不容迴避。不容含糊。不容敷衍。亦不容輕舉妄動。計近利而不慮遠害。必體察環境。順應時代。審愼周慮。謀遠瞰深。共計切實有效之應付。而尤須注意促其實現。</p>
<p>尤有進者。今日新政府成立。一切内政外交。都應在有計劃有目的之政策之下開始其行動。如御車然。必先確定方向。確定行程。確定目的地。然後不至縱轡疾馳。茫無定向。使脚力歸於枉費。甚且如盲人瞎馬。夜半臨池。步入險地而不自覺。以往覆軌。皆爲殷鑑。新政府於此。尤宜三致意馬。</p>

<p>東北淪亡。將四閲月矣。東北同胞被踐踏於日暴軍鐵蹄之下。「死的恐怖」「生的凌遲」。備受荼毒亦已將四閲月矣。四閲月來日軍之槍砲聲與東北同胞之哀號聲。常依稀震撼吾人之耳膜。顧我河山。念我同胞。眞令人欲哭無淚。現日本更節節進迫。大舉犯我錦州。其欲吞併我整個東北。進而顚覆我國家。滅亡我民族。蓋已澈底暴露。此實爲我國家民族生死存亡之最後關鍵。我人必以全國一致之努力。奮起抗暴。始能自救。而靑年諸君。爲社會之中堅。國家之生命所托。肩頭上所負荷之責任。尤爲艱鉅。老夫耄矣。無能報國。前曾以仿古制創辦保甲之法爲救國方策。爲我靑年諸君吿。茲當一九三二年之始。謹再以三事相勗勉即當新年之獻詞。</p>
<p>一曰不買日貨「經濟絶交」一語。在今日幾已成爲「口頭襌」。然此實弱國反抗强國之最要而且最有效之方策。我國向爲日貨之最大市塲。我市塲如能杜絶日貨。持以十年。則在經濟上足以促日本之動搖。此種工作。固有賴乎吾全國同胞之身體力行。而我靑年諸君。當爲社會之表率。尤應力求樸實。拒用日貨。以爲倡導。風行草偃。排貨工作。庶可以澈底堅持。</p>
<p>二曰研究科學。立國於二十世紀科學之世界。必賴科學發達。始足以自存。中國今日之危亡。實根因於科學之落後。不買日貨。固爲救亡之善策。發展工業。以自國製品代替日貨。尤爲刻不容綏之要圖。是以靑年諸君今日在校求學。必須手腦并用。研究與實騐并重。能如是。然後乃能求得「眞的知識」與「活的學問」。必有「眞的知識」與「活的學問」。乃能實際應用。以科學救國。以科學建國。以科學創造全人類之福利。此則靑年諸君所應肩負之責任也。</p>
<p>三曰唤起民衆。我中國文化落後。敎育未能普及。故文盲特多。東北淪亡。雖已數月。窮鄉僻地之民衆。恐尙有不知其事或多不明其眞相者。抗暴自救。必須全國一致努力。今民衆對暴日之侵凌東北。尙屬茫然。更何能激起其爱國之熱忱。以共赴國難。寒假巳届。諸君必多返里。際此時會。對於日本問題與東北問題應加意研究。將國内外情勢及暴日犯我東北之實况。詳爲鄉民講述。大聲疾呼。使全國民衆奮起。共救國家之危亡。此舉亦非常切要。萬勿等閒視之。</p>
<p>歲時更新。然而吾人之創痛則依舊。而且錦州風雲。刻又突吿緊急。故吾人雖在今日新年元旦。仍不容有一絲之歡欣。深盻全國各大學。中學。各敎育界圑體。學生圑體。婦女圑體等。更以新的决心。新的精神。努力於抗暴自救。老夫發起之江蘇省國難救濟會同人。亦當以加緊之努力。與靑年諸君携手共臻於奮鬥之大道。</p>

<p>漢口通信、民國二十年之湖北民政·財政·建設·敎育·諸端、因赤匪之猖獗、與水災之重大、在在阻其進展、茲值歲序更新、爰就經過情形、紀其大略如次、</p>
<p>▲民政民政廳本年三易廳長、因政見之不同、不免有偏重偏輕之弊、最先者爲吳醒亞、注重地方自治、編排保甲、厲行淸鄉、以經費支絀、阻於衆議、未竟全功、劉文島繼任民政廳長、對於前任未竟之事、未能繼續舉辦、現廳長朱懷冰、始復注重清鄉、各縣縣長須負剿匪責任、有舞弊殃民者、處以嚴刑峻法、并注意圑防之整理、朱氏曾親赴鄂東各縣視察、將繼續至鄂南鄂西鄂北視察、以便改革、其他要政、尙無若何建白、</p>

<p>不除庭草齋夫談薈</p>
<h3 id="c103">新年三問三答（上） <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>）不庭齋談除草夫薈（從前有一位國王拿着三個問題去問一位隱士説：『什麽人是最重要的人？什麽事是最重要的事？什麽話是最重要的話？』</p>
<p>如果中國四萬萬阿斗要拿這三個問題埀問於我，我將毫不遲疑的回答說：</p>
<p>靑年人是最重要的人；愛護靑年人是最重要的事；爲靑年人說的公道話是最重要的話。</p>
<p>這些年來，靑年人是像蘿蔔頭様一簍一簍的砍，砍下的頭可以砌成一座山，山上坐着幾個偉人，正在那兒喝酒圑拜咧。我今啓奏阿斗陛下，從今以後，不可再許政府殺人，尤其是殺靑年人。</p>
<p>一·殺不可以止殺。「殺以止殺」是一種迷信。掌權的人總相信「殺一警百。」這與帝國主義者之「戰以止戰」之口頭禪無異。實際是戰以召戰，殺以召殺。大槪政府要殺的人有兩種：一是爲飢寒所迫之盜匪：二是抱有不同信抑之政敵。盜匪非殺所能止；飢寒止則盜匪止了。政敵以殺身爲成仁，以死爲殉道，殺他便是揚湯止沸。古人說得好·「民不畏死，奈何以死畏之。」</p>
<p>二·殺人是瘋子的行爲。個人心懷仇恨，如瘋似癲，纔會殺人。「政者正也。」政府不該有恨，如何殺人？</p>
<p>三·殺人者不仁。中山先生勉勵人實行忠孝節義仁愛和平。仁愛便是不嗜殺人。以人殺人是不仁之甚者。</p>
<p>四·殺人者不智。法國革命不能容一科學家拉瓦錫，是法國人之不智。中國近年所殺之無數靑年中誰能擔保没有幾個拉瓦錫一流的人才呢？退一步說，一個很尋常的人自小到二十歲社會的培養費至少也要二三千元。現在有人把大洋錢三千，兩千的摔到海裏去，可算是有智識嗎？有法駕馭老虎的人總要捉活虎</p>
<p>，因爲活虎是比死虎有用得多咧。只有笨的獵戶才打死虎。老虎尙且不要打死，何况人呢？我们應該知道殺機不止，必至相殺到了最後，只是借别人的刀殺自己的人</p>
<p>五·殺人者不勇。殺人不出於仇恨，必出於畏懼。政府不當有仇恨，更不當畏懼。天下多少生命是葬送在這無理性之畏懼呀！</p>
<p>六·中山先生寫過一副對聯：『養天地正氣：法古今完人。』天地之正氣便是好生之德。古今之完人没有一個不是善體天地好生之德，也没有一個是贊成殺人的。孔子說堯帝：『惟天惟大，惟帝則之。』因爲他所行的是天道，王道。堯才是中國的完人。至於舜之流共工，放驩兜，殺三苗，殛鯀，便不及堯多多了。國外古代之完人如釋迦牟尼，如耶穌基督，莫不戒殺。『養天地正氣：法古今完人』不是空言所能做到的，必須發爲政令，從廢除死刑做起。</p>
<p>七·廢除死刑之具體辦法列舉如下：</p>
<p>甲凡死罪均改爲無期徒刑；</p>
<p>乙在海邊找一能容幾十萬人耕種做工之海島爲敎養此項犯人之所；</p>
<p>丙島上設大規模之科學館·圖書館·農塲·林塲·手工藝塲·機械工廠爲各種犯人修學習藝之所；</p>
<p>丁島上設其他人生的必需之機關，以爲犯人調劑生活之所；</p>
<p>戊全島設總指導一人由政府任命之；</p>
<p>己全島設指導員無定額，由總指導聘請之，或於犯人中之有相當資格者選任之；</p>
<p>庚犯人研究科學有所發明，從事工作有所創製者得恢復其自由。</p>
<h3 id="c104">請從元旦做起 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>朋友。今天是元旦了。想想民間的疾苦。國家的多難。倘再比較起去年的今天。夠多麽令人興悲。當這簇嶄新的新年裏。那個又不發生美中不足的感槪呢。但是。在滿充着生機的出發點的今日。希望大家刻骨銘心的不要忘記下邊的幾條話。更虔誠祈禱大家。尤其是新靑年男女們。個個要躬行實踐的「幹」。纔好。</p>
<p>一、從元旦起。每早離明即起。運動身體三十分鐘。活絡週身血脈。使的和鋼一般的堅强。以便做枕戈禦侮。共赴國難的準備。</p>
<p>二、從元旦起。每早鍛錬身體後。繼續閱續有益身心的書報。起碼一百二十分鐘。（連休息照碼加一）</p>
<p>三、從元旦起。實行簡單生活。節衣縮食。安居習勞。練成飽滿的精神。把忠實而負責任的態度。表現出來。</p>
<p>四、從元旦起。個個自動取消一切虚榮心的消費。像飲酒、吸烟、賭博装飾等。養成絶無不良嗜好的人格。更進一步將所節省下的袁頭。捐做救國儲金。或其他公益基金。</p>
<p>五、從元旦起。人人擴大宣傳。深入民間。使每個國人不用一點仇貨。並且咬緊牙關。少用外洋經濟侵略我們的東西。一方面盡力設法生產。將我國原有的材料改良製造出來。運銷到各國。撈回我們以前的損失。</p>
<p>六、從元旦起。要有正大光明的胸襟。和服務社會先公後私的顴念。本着人類的友愛互助。精誠圑結矯正社會的現實風化。</p>
<p>七、從元旦起。把每個靑年所固有的肝膽、血氣、豪俠的氣槪。整個兒發楊光大起來。</p>
<p>起來起來。「一年之計在於春。一日之計在於晨」。這話眞不錯呀。起來起來。國人們。親愛的男女靑年們。請從元旦做起來。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>▲楔子</p>
<p>近爲申報撰寫一部長篇章回小説。名曰「戎馬雙棲記」。乍看這個名兒。雖奸似傳奇式描寫自來才子佳人的陳言爛套。但由我這枝拙筆寫起這書中故事來。却并非那様。我所要寫的。是一部整個的而又具有奇巧結搆的故事。而故事的性質。完全合乎平凡的現代性。書名雖只管題做戎馬雙棲記。却并非是一段美滿絢爛的好姻緣。其中男女兩個主角。一非戎馬書生般的英雄。二非　　將軍般的英雌。不過他們這段姻緣是在戎馬時期中搆成。等到這時期過去。一切憧憬似水泡般消失了。他們這姻緣也就告終了。大略的情節。是叙述一個大學高材生。不滿意於他家庭中替他所强訂的婚約。在外面另交著兩個愛人。一個是女學生。一個是曾經嫁過闊人的名妓。後因爲家鄉中遭了匪禍。父母雙亡。資產盡失。那名妓能供給他的金錢。又能替他尋求出路。他就捨棄情愛。背了那女學生。毅然與那名妓結爲夫婦。終於藉那名妓的力量。得著某督軍姨太太一條線索。汲引到做了軍官。并收撫了曾殺害過他父母的匪徒。編爲軍隊。那名妓也躊躇滿志。一躍而爲很出風頭的軍官夫人。在這個過程裏。那個失戀的女學生。父親原是個貪婪的縣令。因案被控褫職。景况就變得很不好。投身於陸軍病院裏當看護。又新愛上了一個跛醫生。不料那醫生另有一段最傷心的情史。不能接受伊的愛。更使伊非常的抱恨。但他這個負心人。飛黃騰達以後。把他一個碩果僅存的弱弟。帶在身邊。也送到模範幼年軍去入伍。誰知這個無知的小孩子。跟著嫂嫂。常和督軍姨太太們廝混。招惹了點瞹昧的嫌疑。受了一下大打擊。他親送這垂死的弟弟到醫院時。無意中却與那女學生又見了一回。然而伊是更瞧他不起了。他爲了亡弟的禍事。深怕官職不保。極力的再向某督軍獻媚。物色得一個最美麗的賣解女郎。送與督軍作妾。但那女郎也是另有愛人的。用一種消極的抵抗。打動了某督軍豪爽的心性。開籠放雀。將伊資遣走了。他却依然升了衛隊旅長。一帆風順。仍做他的好官。幾年以後。某督軍兵敗。落荒而走。那賣解女郎與伊的愛人操舟爲業。感念前恩。就將某督軍救出了重圍。他同時也失職賦開。匿居在和界裏。當他作官之時。兩夫妻都異常揮霍放縱。并没有積下多的錢。候了些時。某督軍勢難再起。他們就窮苦得不堪了。那名妓回想從前。宛如一塲怪夢。一旦覺醒過來。深覺兩個人再這樣厮守著。於他有害無益。主張各奔西東。各尋生路。并勸他仍回故鄉。收拾餘燼。死也做過歸正首丘的　。他别了那名妓。先尋到那女學生。遭了伊的拒絶。只好回家去仍與那鄉下未婚妻成婚。以農夫終老。至於那個名妓呢。下落却不大分明。也有說伊姘了個開烟館的老頭子的。也有人見　伊是在理發館當女招待的。漸漸是無可稽攷了。由這樣一個故事。和許多複雜的方面。寫成一部二十回的章回小說。其中叙愛情·叙戰爭·叙武俠·叙各種的社會與人物。自然都須很忠實很瑣細的描寫一個極其透切。以表現出這個時代的人生。與其循環的因果。但我所抱的是客觀的態度、除了很忠實很瑣細描寫出來。以供披露。以供展覽。以期一般讀者得到一點暗示或聯想以外。并没有半點主觀上褒貶任何方面諷剌任何人物的意思。從過去的那些軍閥。以至於這些迷亂的男女。我都認爲是時代下的犠牲者。他們和伊們都很可悲憫的啊。至於本篇這一段的記述。說是楔子也可。說是說明書也可。與小說正文無關。只是約略的先報告書中情節與書中意趣一個大槪。就算是一篇廣告。也未嘗不可。本書自今日起發刋。我自當竭十二分的精力。毫不懈惠的往下寫作。求其一氣呵成。除版權己　申報館外。但尙保留有攝製影片的權利。如將來有認爲可采取書中情節以製影片者。應先取得區區的同意。</p>

<p>金作幤價之根據、而貨幤爲人生所必需、故人民對於黃金之價値、早有明確之認識、然事實上恒有積多量現金於工商業不興之地、則非値失其調劑金融之效、且足以造成經濟制度之慘落、年來生金產量、逐漸减少、而世界需金程度、年增百分之二、相形之下、愈覺現金之不敷供幣價之根據、故金貴之事實、亦屬無可諱言、蓋世界各國物價、日趨下途、舉凡麥棉銀等日用品與金之比價、益見低廉、於是需求複本位制之呼聲、應時而起、是固足擴大幤價之基本位、亦足使物價、逐淅平均適中、然對於金銀之眞確性、不無發生疑竇、且一旦白銀產量不足時、亦一嚴重問題也、他若法定貨幤内含金分量之减少、亦爲補救之一策、至於最新式之幤價根據、當推物價指數方法、惟其主要之難點有二、一爲將某某物價之指數、而求其一類之共同指數、二爲在於權衡上、其中包括工資與租金、及其他關於造成指數之種種考慮、考指數方法之成功與否、完全視人民之信仰心而定、夫金本位在世界財政上、所以日暮途窮者、亦因失去人民信仰心所致也、又如美國通行之紙幤、現金準備、僅及百分之四十、然人民信仰心堅固、對於百分之四十現金準備、認爲切合需求目的、故幤制之信用、得以維持、實際上美國之幤制、有與物價指數相脗合、此項指數、大體言之、約分二部、一部爲百分之四十之現金準備、另一部則爲百分之六十之美國國家準備銀行所發行之商用票據、故事實俱在、爲謀將來之發展指數方法、行將爲大衆人士所注目、據美國勞工局所定之指數中、有一指數、係根據五百五十種物價而定、毎種物價、皆有一定權量、依照科學方法、用深䆳學理、使成指數、惟批發物價之指數、似不甚合於幤價之標準、據英國經濟學者、Ｊ·Ｍ·Ｋeynes氏之主張、謂一實在物價之變動、須有重要論據、凡僱傭之情形、出品之多寡、銀行放欵之限度、各種投資所得之利率、新生產之容量、現金流動之數目、國外貿易狀况統計、及匯價之均數、皆須詳細研究之一Keynes氏及其著名經濟學者意見、認爲物價之穩固、乃吾人需求之目的、年來固定物價之種種不幸試行、甚王使數國經濟地位、根本動搖、故人多謂固持物價、係屬不良辦法、又美國國家銀行GeorgeRoberts氏曾主張堅固樹立個人努力制度、然實際上亦不甚合於世界潮流、蓋如此爲謀穩固起見、吾人行將變成機械人矣、</p>

<h3 id="e1">1932 World Outlook by Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Cruel facts have completely shattered the illusory dream of international capitalism forever maintaining its lifespan and prosperity. The world is advancing towards a turbulent, chaotic, and terrifying situation at an accelerated pace. At the same time, it is also taking great strides towards another new, bright, peaceful, and happy universe. The past 1931 has already proven to us that this theory is absolutely true. And the new symbol on the wave of time, 1932, precisely indicates that the day for this theory to become a reality is approaching. At the beginning of 1932, our outlook on the world can at least make such a quasi-prophetic deduction.</p>
<p>However, this prediction is not at all absurd or ridiculous, because the world of 1932 must unfold according to the "iron law of cause and effect."</p>
<p>What "causes" did the past 1931 plant for the future world?</p>
<p>The panic of the third period of capitalism has expanded and deepened to the extreme. Agricultural depression, industrial decline, scarcity of raw materials, decline in overseas trade, reduction in social purchasing power, sharp increase in unemployed masses, overproduction, leading to stock market crashes, erosion of bank credit, and further formation of an increasingly expanding and deepening financial panic. From Austria and Germany to England, it directly threatened the financial markets of the United States, the kingdom of gold. Last year, more than 800 local banks went bankrupt one after another. Since 1920, the total number of bankrupt banks has reached about 7,000. From October 7th to October 15th, the New York Federal Reserve Bank repeatedly ordered to raise the discount rate to 3.5%, but the frenzy of cash outflow could not be contained as a result. From September 17th to October 15th, the Federal Reserve Bank had lost as much as $650 million in cash. In the deepening panic, England abandoned the gold standard. Sweden, Norway and other countries also abandoned the gold standard. Japan in East Asia also implemented a gold embargo as a result. The Hoover moratorium on war debts failed to alleviate the economic distress of Europe and avoid its own impending predicament. Moreover, due to the deepening of the economic panic, the political panic has also deepened. The victory of the National Socialist Party in the German general election, the establishment of the British National Government, and the re-emergence of the Seiyukai cabinet in Japan, under the right-leaning international political situation, further strengthened the opposition of the left-leaning forces. The entire international capitalism has fallen into a very distressed and difficult situation. All capitalists are trapped in a very confused and worried atmosphere. As Keynes said, "We are today caught in an inescapable maze, because in dealing with a flexible machine (the economic machine of capitalism), we are constantly making mistakes. We do not understand the rules of this machine at all." As Ramon's colleague, the top leader of American financial capital, said, "All our previous scientific research was aimed at pointing out to the world how they can prevent this excessive development of industrial operation. This research has failed." Indeed, this research is declared a failure.</p>
<p>No country under the German, Austrian, British, French, American, or the entire capitalist system is not shrouded in the terrifying depression. Virtually no country can be an exception. In order to illustrate the extent of its deepening panic, let's take Japan in the Far East as an example.</p>
<p>In terms of the sharp drop in agricultural prices, chrysanthemums in Chiba Prefecture were burned in large quantities. Tanaka in Kanagawa posted a notice saying "Please take radishes as you please." In Nakakawachi, Osaka, transporting vegetables to the market for sale cannot even cover the transportation costs. Everyone is thinking about joining the strike alliance. In terms of rural debt, it has reached more than 5 billion yuan. In terms of the unemployed masses, it has also reached more than 2 million. In terms of labor disputes, there have been as many as 1,478 cases from January to August last year, an increase of 23% compared with the same period of the previous year. In terms of overseas trade, losses to our country have reached 150 million yuan since September 18th. In terms of bank failures, 15 banks have suspended business from January to August this year. In terms of national finance, the budget for this year has been drastically reduced, but it is still insufficient by 120 million yuan. The entire society is plunged into the abyss of depression, and the lives of the masses are deteriorating day by day. Is this one example not enough</p>
<p>to see the whole picture of the crumbling situation of the entire capitalist economy?</p>
<p>Precisely because of the deepening and expansion of the capitalist crisis, the crisis of a new world war is also approaching day by day. Every imperialist country is doing its best to plan and carry out preparations for a new war.</p>
<p>The new war is for the redistribution of markets, for the competition for raw materials necessary for heavy industries such as oil, coal, steel, water and electricity, rubber, and palm trees, for the expansion of capital exploitation, for the protection of past investments, and for the suppression of colonies in turmoil. The British government has suspended the gold standard, reduced the price of products, and is stepping up its overseas trade along the sea route, attempting to restore the glory of its capitalist advanced country. However, this fact is precisely in direct conflict with the financial kingdom of America anytime and anywhere. Similarly, Japan is also standing on the front of this fact, forming a triangular contest in the Pacific. In Europe, for the sake of competing for the hegemony of the European continent, and the Mediterranean and African colonies, England and France are clearly confronting each other. For the sake of competing for the Mediterranean commercial route, and competing for colonies and spheres of influence in North Africa and Asia, France and Italy are confronting each other. The various capitalist countries are sharply opposed to each other based on their respective interests. The opposition of economic barriers (tariffs) is needless to say, and the opposition in war preparations is in fact becoming increasingly evident.</p>
<p>At present, the world's 60 countries spend a total of 4,158,000,000 gold yuan on military spending, which is more than what was spent before the war. The United States ranks first, France ranks third, and England ranks fourth, followed by Italy and Japan. Hoover estimates that the sum of the figures of various countries may be 70% more than that before the war. According to the report of the International Yearbook, within 1930, at a time when economic bankruptcy was difficult to raise funds, the same expenditure on military expenses had increased by 100,000,000 gold yuan. The weapons of various countries are also increasingly striving to focus on four points: "increased firepower," "mechanization," "increased air power," and "chemical warfare preparedness." What do these facts illustrate? Don't they illustrate that a new war will become unavoidable? Grenier, the chief of the German military department, once said, "The future war is only a matter of time." This sentence is truly "to the point."</p>
<p>The September 18th Incident on the northeast corner of our country has already fired a starting gun. This year's American naval exercise is in the Pacific. Everyone will not ignore these facts, will they?</p>
<p>However, here we should not ignore the other aspect of the facts. Under the capitalist system, outside the circle of the entire desolate world, there is a Soviet Union that is advancing towards the future of construction. The Soviet Union, after the era of war communism (ultra-leftist policy) from 1917 to 1921, and the era of the New Economic Policy (left-leaning easing policy) from 1921 to 1928, has gradually transitioned from today's economic recovery to socialistization. The five-year plan that began to be implemented in 1928 will be completed by the end of September this year, and a new five-year plan has also been established. It stands outside the distressed world, waiting with a calm and optimistic attitude for an opportunity to fundamentally destroy this distressed world. Its military expenditure ranks high in the world, ranking second, and its powerful army and modern military equipment are enough to give a powerful threat to international imperialists. With the existence of the Soviet Union, international imperialists cannot rest easy for a single day. At the same time, if the imperialist forces are not eliminated for a single day, the activities of the Soviet Union will not end for a single day. Coupled with the intensification of social movements in various capitalist countries and the intensification of independence movements in various colonies and semi-colonies, another meaning of opposition is formed here. This opposition is becoming increasingly acute, and the war to change the face of the world is also waiting for the day to suddenly unfold.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Second World War between capitalist countries will plunge all mankind into a more tragic hell, and they will never be able to turn over. The outbreak of the war between capitalism and socialism will be the fundamental elimination of the word "war," and will renew the world and point mankind to a bright paradise. These two types of wars with different qualities are accelerating their preparations. They are all advancing under the "cause" planted in 1931. 1932 only explains in time that this preparation and advancement work has already reached a new realm. The arrival of the great era can be vaguely seen.</p>
<p>The world will have a thorough change. In the process of change, China is in a position to inevitably bear the shock of various forces. What should China do? Here I borrow two sentences.</p>
<p>"A period is coming soon, which will make us fundamentally decide the question of standing on this side or that side."</p>
<p>Does China stand on this side? Does it stand on that side? Or does it stand in the surging torrent, listening to fate and passively accepting the impact of the torrent of the times? It is time to decide.</p>

<p>Chairman of the National Government Lin Sen</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese expect to occupy Jinzhou by Sunday at the latest. This is because the Honjo Headquarters here received news that Zhang Xueliang has ordered the troops in Jinzhou to completely retreat into the pass. Therefore, Jinzhou can be obtained easily. It is reported that the Chinese army is quite depressed due to the retreat order and the lack of military supplies. It is now believed that within a week, the Liaonan area from Shenyang to the Great Wall will be completely under Japanese control. The Chinese army between Goubangzi and Jinzhou is also withdrawing without waiting for the Japanese army to attack. Therefore, the troops under Domon can drive straight in without resistance. However, there are still scattered battles between Goubangzi and Dawa. A Japanese regiment was attacked by 3,000 unofficial Chinese soldiers this morning, but after only 30 minutes of fighting, they were driven away by the Japanese soldiers. Honjo has dispatched additional troops to the west of the Liao River because of the rampant banditry. )31st National News Agency Dispatch(</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Today, the Jinzhou army continued to retreat into the pass, while the Japanese army concentrated in Goubangzi, about 40 miles from Jinzhou, and temporarily stopped advancing. The Japanese commander Honjo convened a meeting of staff officers in the headquarters today to discuss the strategy of occupying Jinzhou. According to Japanese sources, there is currently a very thin defense line set up by the Chinese side between Goubangzi and Jinzhou. There are still troops defending the banks of the Daling River, covering the remaining troops in Jinzhou. At this time, although the Japanese army occupies important places such as Goubangzi, Dagushan, Panshan, and Tianzhuangtai, its rear transportation is often cut off by volunteer army and bandits. Even at this time, small battles are still going on in various places, so they dare not advance lightly. The main force of the Kamamura Brigade on the Beining main line occupied Dagushan at 3:00 PM yesterday and will advance to Goubangzi today to join the Domon troops on the Yingkou-Goubangzi line, temporarily stopping there. The local militias and volunteer army in the Tianzhuangtai area still attack the Japanese army from time to time. The Japanese have left a large independent garrison to defend there, but it is reported that the transportation line there has recently been cut off by the volunteer army. Also, the militia in Baiqibao, after being forced away by Japanese artillery fire yesterday, has now concentrated in Liuhegou and has dismantled the Beining railway tracks. The Japanese army in Xinmin has now dispatched the Nakajima troops to attack, and it is reported that the most fierce battle yesterday was at Tongmachang (transliteration) southeast of Goubangzi. Our armored train fought fiercely with the Japanese 2nd Division for three hours. Finally, due to Japanese planes flying to drop bombs, it gradually became unable to support itself.

<p>Chen Youren to Take Charge from Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This plenary session, regarding foreign policy, decided on principles to recover lost territories and incorporate the three northeastern provinces into our nation's map. It resolved not to allow the violent Japanese to forcibly seize [territory]. Should Japanese troops advance, we must resist with all our might and not retreat. However, there will be no declaration of war against them. The detailed measures will be drafted by the Special Foreign Affairs Committee and earnestly implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the meeting, some Central Executive Committee members advocated personally going to the front lines to organize a Recover Lost Territories Committee to boost morale. This proposal was widely supported by many committee members. The current government has decided on this policy, strictly telegraphing Zhang Xueliang to defend Jinzhou to the death and not lightly abandon it. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Some, due to foreign telegrams alleging that Zhang Xueliang's troops withdrew from Jinzhou under government orders, specially visited the official residence of the new Foreign Minister Chen Youren to inquire about the truth. Chen replied that it was completely inaccurate and stated that before today, the interim government was responsible for the Jinzhou incident and he bears no responsibility. Only from tomorrow onwards will he be responsible for the new government. According to what he knew, the interim government had repeatedly ordered Zhang to hold firm on the Jinzhou matter and yesterday there was still a telegram ordering Zhang to hold firm at any cost. The new government will also continue this policy. Zhang is holding firm. (31st Dispatch)</p>

It is said that our side seems to have been slightly moved, so the Sino-Japanese issue will enter a new phase. It is also said that our side's policy towards Japan will still be based on the policies declared by Chen Youren in Shanghai. Kayano has already gone to Shanghai the night before to have a meeting with Chen Youren and will rush back to Tokyo to report soon. As for whether the currently transmitted troop withdrawal from Jinzhou is related to Kayano's visit to Nanjing, it is still unknown. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Special Council Meeting Unlikely to be Convened</p>
<p>Investigation Team Has Not Yet Been Organized</p>
<p>(Paris) The organization of the League of Nations' Manchuria Investigation Team has suffered another setback because Lord Lytton, the former Viceroy of India, is unwilling to serve as an investigator, because it is not easy to find a suitable British representative to replace him. The investigators who have been appointed are French General Claudel, German Dr. Schnee, and Italian Count Aldrovandi. It is now known that Hines, who served as the director of the American military railway during the European War, will not be the American representative. It is likely that an army officer will be appointed as the US representative, but his name has not yet been announced. It is only heard that the person is not US Ambassador to England, General Dawes. Mr. Wu, the representative to the League of Nations, is now urging the immediate dispatch of an investigation team. Mr. Wu recently negotiated this matter with Aristide Briand, the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations. Briand claimed that his views were the same as those of Mr. Wu, but the British government has not yet replied after being asked to nominate a committee member. Mr. Wu later visited Massigli, the director of the League of Nations Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and told him that the Japanese army in Manchuria is now active again, and the League of Nations should find a way immediately. Mr. Wu also wrote to Briand stating this intention. Briand will distribute the letter to all members of the Administrative Council, but there is no sign of convening a special meeting of the Administrative Council. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e28">New Year and the New Government <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Today is New Year's Day, 1932. And the new government of peaceful unification is also announced today. Establishing a new government at the turn of the year has special significance and is sufficient for our people and political leaders to ponder deeply.</p>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new. All things are renewed. This is why we express our deepest joy, celebration, and hope to the New Year. At the same time, our joy and celebration for the realization of the unification and peace of the new government are even greater today, and our hopes are even more earnest. Why? The years flow by, and there are endless New Years to come. But the establishment of the new government and its future administration are related to the life and death of our nation and people today. The last opportunity, once lost, is gone forever.</p>
<p>The problems presented to the new government today are: First, how to resist foreign aggression? Second, how to maintain internal peace? From September 18th to today, almost four months have passed. Under the instigation of the Japanese, it is rumored that the lost territories of Liaoning and Jilin will also change flags today. Half of the country is at the mercy of others, and the sound of war drums in western Liaoning is rising again. Violent troops are advancing westward, and Jinzhou is in danger. How will we resist this aggressive enemy that is pressing us so urgently? How will we recover the lost territories of Liaoning and Jilin? This question is urgent, imminent, and unavoidable. Therefore, how to resist foreign aggression is one of the urgent matters that the new government should plan for. Last year's floods devastated almost the entire country. The areas traversed by the torrents were desolate. Agriculture was bankrupt, people were displaced, and people's livelihoods were ruined. Not only in the disaster areas, but also due to the backwardness of national production, the social economy is increasingly decaying and collapsing. Agricultural production is declining, and farmers are increasingly leaving the land. Industry is depressed, and workers are increasingly unemployed. The number of unemployed people nationwide is almost countless. The more unemployed there are, the more the "banditry" becomes like wildfire, unstoppable. The entire social order is disrupted, and people are panicked all day long. This problem is also pressing on the new government. How to transform the social economy, how to relieve people's difficulties, and how to stabilize social order are also matters that the new government should plan for today. We believe that we must be determined to thoroughly implement the policy of overthrowing imperialism in order to talk about resisting aggression and violence. Internally, we must take the interests of the suffering masses as the premise in order to talk about maintaining order. Otherwise, speaking of foreign affairs, when one tiger is repelled, another wolf comes. Relying on the League of Nations will ultimately be difficult to save ourselves. Speaking of internal affairs, going against the interests of the masses is to increase the suffering of the masses. At the extreme of suffering, everyone thinks of rebellion, and order becomes more and more chaotic as they try to stabilize it. The social economy becomes more and more declining as they try to revive it. Or, if not, international economic co-management, and then political co-management, are enough to make our country a true colony and trap it in an abyss from which it can never escape. Therefore, the new government cannot avoid, cannot be vague, cannot perfunctorily deal with these two major problems that are pressing on it, nor can it act rashly, consider only short-term interests without considering long-term harms. It must understand the environment, conform to the times, consider carefully, plan far ahead, and jointly formulate practical and effective responses, and pay special attention to promoting their realization.</p>
<p>What's more, with the establishment of the new government today, all internal and foreign affairs should begin its actions under a planned and purposeful policy. Like driving a car, one must first determine the direction, determine the route, and determine the destination, so as not to gallop wildly without a direction, wasting energy, or even like a blind man riding a blind horse at midnight by a pond, entering a dangerous place without realizing it. The previous mistakes are lessons. The new government should pay special attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Finland Reinstates Alcohol Prohibition <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Result of National Referendum</p>
<p>Support and Opposition Ratio is One to Four</p>
<p>▲Havas, Helsinki, 30th: Whether Finland's alcohol prohibition should be maintained or abolished will be decided by a national referendum, which concluded this afternoon. Since the implementation of the prohibition in 1919, debates have been fierce on all sides, further fueled by political and religious views, making the situation particularly fervent. According to the current regulations, all beverages containing alcohol are prohibited, except for beer with an alcohol content not exceeding two degrees. As a result, private brewing and smuggling have become rampant, similar to the situation in the United States. Opinions on the prohibition vary, so a national referendum was held. Before the vote, all parties campaigned vigorously, causing great unrest. All newspapers participated, with conservatives and liberals calling for reform, while farmers and socialists demanded the status quo. There were speeches, appeals, and advertisements galore.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Helsinki, 31st: The national referendum on the prohibition law has been held for two days. Those advocating prohibition failed by a ratio of one to four. Generally speaking, the people of the country are not very welcoming of the prohibition law. Even in Lapua, known for its conservatism, many voters abstained. In other areas, rain and snow caused delays in voting. Smugglers from neighboring countries used all their strength to campaign for the maintenance of the current prohibition law, spending over ten million marks. Most voters were from cities because police enforcement in rural towns was strict, but private brewing and smuggling still occurred everywhere. Voters had to answer three questions. A total of 13,000 people advocated maintaining the prohibition law, 600 advocated allowing beverages with a mild alcohol content, and 65,000 advocated abolishing the prohibition law.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia and Poland Agree</p>
<h3 id="e49">to Negotiate Non-Aggression Treaty <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Romania-Hungary Treaty Negotiations Concluded</p>
<p>▲Guomin, Paris, 30th: This morning, French newspapers widely reported news from Bucharest that Soviet Russia and Poland, and Soviet Russia and Romania, will separately conclude non-aggression treaties within a few days. However, well-informed sources here claim that this is premature. Although the important points have been agreed upon, some details still need to be sorted out, and some items may become major obstacles to progress, requiring lengthy consultations.</p>
<p>▲Guomin, Bucharest, 30th: It is claimed here today that Romania and Soviet Russia are about to complete negotiations on a non-aggression treaty and will now separately conclude similar treaties with Germany and Hungary. Regarding the Romania-Hungary treaty, former Hungarian Prime Minister Count Bethlen and the King of Romania met in Transylvania and completed negotiations.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Berlin, 30th: According to Romanian news, there are signs of negotiations between Soviet Russia and Romania on the conclusion of a non-aggression pact. German political circles are very interested. However, it is generally believed that negotiations with Romania and Poland cannot be successful at the same time because Soviet Russia has long made claims regarding sovereignty over Bessarabia. Before this issue is resolved, there is no possibility of rapprochement between Russia and Romania. The Vossische Zeitung reported that a protocol was signed on the Bessarabia issue during the armistice of the European War. This time, when Russia and Romania negotiate a non-aggression pact, Russia does not need to explicitly acknowledge this, but can implicitly recognize Romania's existing borders in practice. The newspaper also said that this view belongs to the Romanian press, and the good faith of Soviet Russia in concluding a non-aggression pact may not be increased as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e50">New Building for Disarmament Conference to be Completed <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 30th: Geneva is rapidly preparing for the Disarmament Conference to be held on February 2nd. The new building of the League of Nations Secretariat is gradually being completed and will serve as office space for the various committees of the Disarmament Conference. In addition to several conference rooms, there is a post office, telegraph office, library, tea room, and forty-four telephones for the use of journalists, all with special equipment. The lower floor has a large hall for public use, and another hall for representatives and journalists. In addition, there are twenty-six rooms and a large photocopying room with a large staircase leading to the upper floor, which has a reception room and two large conference rooms. The president's private office is on another floor, small in size, and located above the telephone room. The plenary session of the Disarmament Conference will still be held at the Batiment Electoral in Geneva, where League of Nations assemblies have been held for years, because the new League of Nations office in Ariana Park outside the city will not be completed for another two or three years. A new large hotel has been built near the station to accommodate travelers during the Disarmament Conference, as it is expected to last for several months. The tram line to the League of Nations Secretariat is now double-tracked to facilitate transportation.</p>

<p>Unrest in Northwest Frontier Pacified</p>
<p>▲Havas, Calcutta, 30th: The Indian Governor-General declared that the Indian government has decided to expedite the revision of the constitution and will take necessary measures to maintain order and uphold the dignity of the law. Non-violent resistance, non-cooperation movements, refusal to pay rent, and boycotts of British goods will not be tolerated. The government cannot condone groups that deliberately create disturbances. The Indian Governor-General severely criticized certain aspects of the All-India Congress's obstructionist policies as unconstitutional and asked the Indian people to trust or cooperate, saying that Gandhi had been asked to use his influence to ease people's minds.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Peshawar, 31st: The Red Shirts' acts of disrupting peace in the Northwest Frontier Province have now stopped. A small squad of British troops has now arrived here. The disruptive behavior of gatherings going to the police station to volunteer for arrest, yesterday, has not recurred. One hundred and twenty Red Shirts detained in Kohat, near Peshawar, have been released after signing guarantees not to cause further trouble. In the area of Karak,</p>

<p>there are still some unrestrained activities. The people ignore government orders and are still gathering.

<p>Three US Postal Workers Injured on the Spot</p>
<p>Investigation Reveals it was the Work of Anti-Bonghat Party</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Easton, 30th: Today, two people sent seven parcels to the Easton Post Office in Pennsylvania, USA, addressed to the Italian Consul-General in New York, the Italian Consul in Pittsburgh, and Italian newspapers in New York. The two people then left in a hurry. The postal workers were suspicious and were inspecting the parcels when one of them suddenly exploded with a loud noise, killing one clerk on the spot. Another person had both arms blown off. A explosives expert took the remaining parcels to the open air for inspection, but another one exploded, seriously injuring the explosives expert. The injured have all been sent to the hospital for treatment. Police arrested two Italians, both residents of New York, who were seen loitering near the post office when the parcels exploded. Police believe that this was the work of the Anti-Bonghat Party, aiming to assassinate Italian financiers, diplomats, and journalists. Post office officials fear that bombs may have been sent elsewhere and have ordered careful inspection of all packages. Police are now trying to protect the lives of those targeted for assassination and have arrested nine male and two female suspects. It is said that when former Italian Prime Minister Nitti passed through Philadelphia during a visit to the United States, a young Italian man loudly insulted him, and the US authorities sentenced him to two years in prison, which greatly angered the American Anti-Bonghat Party.</p>

<p>The Northeast has been lost for almost four months. Northeastern compatriots have been trampled under the iron hooves of the violent Japanese army. The "terror of death" and the "lingering torture of life" have been suffered for almost four months. For four months, the sounds of Japanese guns and cannons and the cries of Northeastern compatriots have often vaguely shaken our eardrums. Looking at our rivers and mountains, thinking of our compatriots, it truly makes people want to cry without tears. Now Japan is pushing forward step by step, launching a large-scale invasion of our Jinzhou. Its desire to annex our entire Northeast, and then overthrow our country and destroy our nation, has been completely exposed. This is truly the final critical moment for the life and death of our country and nation. We must rise up against violence with the united efforts of the whole country to save ourselves. And young people, as the backbone of society and the hope of the nation, bear an especially heavy responsibility on their shoulders. I am old and unable to serve the country. I once advocated imitating the ancient system of establishing Baojia as a strategy to save the country and told my young friends. Now, at the beginning of 1932, I would like to encourage you again with three things as a New Year's message.</p>
<p>First, do not buy Japanese goods. The phrase "economic severance" has almost become "empty talk" today. However, this is truly the most important and effective strategy for a weak country to resist a strong country. Our country has always been the largest market for Japanese goods. If our market can cut off Japanese goods for ten years, it will be enough to shake Japan economically. This work depends on the practical actions of our compatriots throughout the country. And my young friends, as the role models of society, should strive for simplicity and refuse to use Japanese goods as an advocate. When the wind blows, the grass bends. The work of boycotting goods can be thoroughly adhered to.</p>
<p>Second, study science. To establish a nation in the scientific world of the 20th century, it must rely on the development of science to survive. The crisis of China today is truly rooted in the backwardness of science. Not buying Japanese goods is a good strategy for saving the country. Developing industry to replace Japanese goods with domestic products is an even more urgent task. Therefore, my young friends, who are studying at school today, must use both hands and brains, and emphasize both research and experimentation. Only in this way can we obtain "true knowledge" and "living learning". Only with "true knowledge" and "living learning" can we actually apply it to save the country with science, build the country with science, and create the welfare of all mankind with science. This is the responsibility that young people should shoulder.</p>
<p>Third, awaken the masses. Our Chinese culture is backward, and education has not been popularized, so there are many illiterates. Although the Northeast has been lost for several months, the people in remote rural areas may still not know about it or may not fully understand the truth. To resist violence and save ourselves, we must make united efforts throughout the country. Now the masses are still unaware of the violent Japanese invasion of the Northeast. How can we arouse their patriotic enthusiasm to jointly face the national crisis? The winter vacation has arrived, and many of you must return to your hometowns. At this time, you should pay attention to studying the Japanese issue and the Northeast issue, and explain the domestic and international situation and the facts of the violent Japanese invasion of the Northeast to the villagers in detail. Shout loudly to make the people of the country rise up and jointly save the country from danger. This move is also very important and should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>The years are renewed, but our trauma remains. And the situation in Jinzhou is now suddenly reported to be urgent. Therefore, we still cannot have a trace of joy on this New Year's Day. I deeply hope that all universities, middle schools, educational organizations, student organizations, women's organizations, etc., will make new determination and new spirit to work hard to resist violence and save ourselves. The members of the Jiangsu Provincial National Crisis Relief Association, which I initiated, will also work harder and join hands with young people to reach the road of struggle together.</p>

<p>▲Japanese Aircraft Bombing Dagushan and Goubangzi</p>
<p>▲Fierce Fighting in the Hujiawopu Area</p>
<p>Demei Evening News, Jinzhou, 30th: Rong Zhen returned to Jinzhou from Peiping by special express train and arrived in the city at 5:00 PM today. He immediately went to the headquarters to convene his subordinates and hold an emergency meeting. It is expected that the meeting will last until late at night, so British, American, and French military observers and other visitors were unable to meet him. Today, Japanese aircraft returned here for reconnaissance, paying particular attention to the Jiao Tong University campus, where foreign military observers are staying, causing great anxiety. Personnel from the Liaoning Provincial Government are still working at Jiao Tong University, adjacent to where the foreign observers are staying. Regarding military news from the front, after the Japanese army advanced from Panshan, Chinese troops fought bravely in Hujiawopu, using two armored trains and one infantry battalion to resist the Japanese cavalry and armored car teams. The fierceness of the battle was the greatest of all battles this time. In addition, an infantry battalion is on the main line of the Beining Railway between Dagushan and Goubangzi, planning to resist and slow down the Japanese advance. As for the Japanese armored train that departed from Shenyang, it was reported to have arrived at Baiqibao at 11:00 AM this morning. Subsequently, the telephone and telegraph lines were cut, and no further news was received. It is also said that the 3,000-strong 3rd Cavalry Brigade of the Northeast stationed in Zhangwu, on the Datong Line, has not been reported to this headquarters, and the situation is unknown. It was reported tonight that Japanese aircraft bombed Dagushan and Goubangzi stations this morning. In Dagushan, more than 40 bombs were dropped, severely damaging the tracks and completely cutting off traffic. The first Japanese aircraft arrived at 9:30 AM, with seven aircraft staying at Dagushan and one penetrating into Goubangzi, dropping three bombs. An hour later, ten more aircraft circled the two stations but only dropped one bomb in Goubangzi. Around noon, two more aircraft came to Goubangzi, dropped several bombs, and left. The railway tracks before and after Goubangzi station were bombed, but the damage was not as severe as in Dagushan. This afternoon, a track repair car was sent to Goubangzi to repair the tracks, hoping to maintain traffic between Goubangzi and Jinzhou. East of Dagushan, it is reported that Chinese troops blew up a bridge last night to obstruct the Japanese advance.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Xi Qia Concedes Jilin's Rich Resources <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>▲Gold in Muling and Forests in the Mountains</p>
<p>▲Japanese Have Seized Management Rights</p>
<p>▲Current Situation of the Jilin Provisional Provincial Government</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After Xi Qia surrendered to Japan, he repeatedly conceded Jilin's rich resources to Japan. The Changda Railway has already started surveying by the Japanese side and is scheduled to be built in the spring of 1932. The Jichang, Jihai, and Jitun lines will also be connected to complete the South Manchuria Railway's cultivation line. These two matters are in the past. Recently, due to the Japanese side's request, Changchun County Chief Zhao Rumei was also ordered to negotiate the Wanbaoshan case with the Japanese consul. A major case that has attracted national attention was entrusted to a local</p>
<p>county chief for negotiation, and the result of conceding rich resources can be imagined. The Lengchuan Gold Mine in eastern Jilin was originally established in 1927 as a joint venture between the government and merchants. The mining area is located in the Zhishongling of Muling County, covering an area of 47 square miles. Government shares are mostly held by the Jilin Finance Department and Industry Department, while merchant shares are invested by Zhang Zuoxiang, Xi Qia, Zhang Jinghui, and others. Since the start of mining, the results have been very good, producing more than 7,500 taels of gold annually. Except for the Sanjiapigou of Jilin and the Mohe of Heilongjiang, it is the richest gold mine newly developed in the Northeast. Xi Qia recently changed it to a Sino-Japanese joint venture due to Japanese demands. The Chinese side appointed Mao Yujie as the general manager, and the Japanese side sent Yoshida from the East Asia Development Company as the deputy general manager. It is also scheduled to start large-scale mining in the spring of 1932. In addition, the forests in the mountains and along the Jidun line in eastern Jilin</p>
<p>are dense and are also natural rich resources. Recently, Xi Qia also allowed the Japanese side to write off rights in the name of joint venture between the East Asia Development Company and the Chinese side. Another international logging company was established and is planning to start logging in March 1932. The Dawoji, which stretches for hundreds of miles, will be written off by the Japanese side. The Jilin has several rich resources, only the above two. From now on, none of them are ours. At the moment, the Japanese are still asking Xi Qia to add Japanese capital to the three coal mines in Wangqing's Hanwangshan, Yilan's Laoheibei, and Mishan's Xinglonggou. Xi Qia has not allowed it because it is not within his sphere of influence, but the Japanese have not let go.</p>
<p>The Jilin Provisional Provincial Government, after being moved to Bin County, has now taken shape. In order to save expenses, the redundant institutions have been abolished or merged, and the Civil Affairs Department has been restored. The director is concurrently held by Acting Chairman Cheng Yun. The director of the Industry Department is Ma De'en, the director of the Finance Department is Xu Heng, the director of the Education Department is Sun Xiangqian, and the director of the Police Department is Wang Zhiyu. All departments and offices are located in the county's various agencies, and all office personnel are recruited from the old Jilin Yamen, so even without files, the affairs do not stagnate. However, the tax revenue of each county, especially those closer to Jilin, is mostly taken away by the personnel sent by Xi Qia. The remote counties, with their poor income, submit a small amount each month, so the provincial treasury cannot make ends meet. At present, Cheng Yun has reported to Zhang Zuoxiang that he will issue a 5 million provisional provincial government bond to maintain the situation temporarily, but this matter requires the consent of all counties, so it can only be issued after all parties are unobstructed. At present, there are 28 counties under the jurisdiction of the Provisional Provincial Government, but half of them are ambiguous and secretly communicate with Xi Qia and use this situation to enrich themselves. At the same time, some counties under the rule of Xi Qia secretly communicate with Bin County, because these people are trying to preserve their positions. The 28 counties under the jurisdiction of the Provisional Provincial Government are Bin County, Tongjiang, Yilan, Fujin, Huachuan, Fangzheng, Tongbin, Binjiang, Shuangcheng, Fuyu, Baoqing, Raohe, Hulin, Muling, Mishan, Ningan, Dongning, Dehui, Wangchang Mengjiang, Changling, Weihe, Nong'an, Yulin, Wuzhu, Emu Acheng, and Suiyuan. Those under the jurisdiction of Xi Qia are 13 counties (December 25th).</p>

<p>▲Japan Violates League of Nations Resolutions and Seeks More</p>
<p>▲He Will Present Evidence of Japanese Military Atrocities to the Investigation Team</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun of December 26 reported on the machinations of British Ambassador Lamsdorff: Recently, British ambassadors to China have repeatedly expressed anti-Japanese opinions. Now, he is using foreigners residing in Peiping and communication to publish the Japanese military's ambitions in Manchuria, saying that although China is doing its best to endure and adhere to the policy of non-resistance and making concessions in every possible way, Japan is stubbornly and aggressively seeking more, actively attacking, and its violation of the League of Nations resolutions has been recognized by all countries. I (the British ambassador himself) express my sympathy for the patriotic movements of Chinese student groups. If China did not have the appeals and demonstrations of these student groups, the Japanese army would have already eroded the provinces of North China. Now that Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang have stepped down, their strength has not diminished at all. It is hoped that the generals in the north can unite and resist Japan. The Japanese army is not to be feared. The investigation committee of the League of Nations' American and French nations will arrive in China within ten days. I am willing to use my eloquent tongue to present the atrocities of the Japanese army, so that the Japanese army will withdraw from Manchuria and recover the three northeastern provinces. It also said that the United States is gradually taking the same steps as Britain and will issue a second warning to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Unrest in Changle County, Fujian, Not Settled <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>▲Provincial Troops Have Not Yet Advanced to Suppress</p>
<p>▲Farmers Deeply Regret Being Deceived</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Changle Incident occurred, and as of the 25th, the farmers are still occupying the city. Provincial troops have not yet advanced to suppress. The county chamber of commerce provides meals for the farmers, 60 tables per meal. The merchants and residents are complaining incessantly, so on the 24th, they convened a citizens' meeting, which resolved to support the provincial government's ban on opium seedlings and to oppose the marine corps' levy of opium taxes. It also issued a declaration stating that it would implement the automatic removal of opium seedlings as a promotion for all counties, and would resist with all their might anyone who used force to suppress it. The ships traveling between Changle and Fuzhou resumed sailing on the 24th. Wealthy families in the county, fearing that the provincial troops would advance to suppress and devastate the area, fled to the province with their families. It is said that only more than 300 genuine armed farmers entered the city this time, and the rest were bandits from Chen Wei's troops in the southern township of Fuzhou. Recently, there has been a dark undercurrent due to disputes over the allocation of military pay. On the evening of the 23rd, Chen went to rob Wutian Township, at the border of Fuqing and Changle counties. On the 24th, he intercepted a ship sailing from Fuzhou to Kengtian, taking many people. Lin Zongyue, the commander of the guard group elected by the farmers, did not approve of this situation and wanted to withdraw from the county and defend the northern district, but Chen Wei blocked the north gate, not allowing them to leave. Chen's intention was to have the provincial troops advance to suppress, so that the farmers would have nowhere to go, and then kidnap them to the mountains to expand his own power. At this point, the farmers also deeply regretted cooperating with him and leading him into the city, only to be kidnapped by him. The Li Huan regiment of the Liu Heding division, which was transferred by the provincial government, is now led by Brigade Commander Liu Shangzhi and is advancing to Changle to suppress it.

<h3 id="e61">Hubei in the Past Year <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>▲No Progress in Any Facilities</p>
<p>▲Banditry and Floods Are the Main Causes</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The civil administration, finance, construction, education, and other aspects of Hubei Province in the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931) have been hindered in their progress by the rampancy of the Red Bandits and the severity of the floods. As the year draws to a close, I will record the general situation of what has transpired as follows:</p>
<p>▲Civil Administration: The Civil Affairs Department has had three changes of director this year. Due to differences in political views, there have inevitably been biases towards certain areas and neglect of others. The first director, Wu Xingya, focused on local autonomy, organizing the baojia system (a system of collective responsibility), and vigorously suppressing banditry. However, due to financial constraints, he was hindered by public opinion and failed to complete his work. Liu Wendao succeeded him as the director of the Civil Affairs Department but failed to continue the unfinished tasks of his predecessor. The current director, Zhu Huaibing, has once again emphasized the suppression of bandits, requiring county magistrates to be responsible for剿匪. Those who are found to be corrupt or harmful to the people will be punished with severe laws. He also pays attention to the reorganization of local defense. Zhu has personally inspected various counties in eastern Hubei and will continue to inspect southern, western, and northern Hubei in order to implement reforms. No other major political initiatives have been proposed.</p>
<p>▲Finance: The financial situation of Hubei Province has long been on the brink of collapse. On New Year's Day of the twentieth year (1931), the government followed orders to abolish the likin tax (a form of internal tariff) and introduced a business tax to compensate for the loss. However, due to poor implementation, the results have been minimal. After the previous director, Zhang Guanshi, left office, Wu Guozhen succeeded him. Wu, who was originally the director of the Hankou Finance Bureau, also found it impossible to cope with the situation after taking office. The Finance Department is supposed to issue funds for bandit suppression, police, administration, and education, which amount to approximately 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan per month, while the income is only one million yuan. In recent months, it has been relying entirely on borrowing to make ends meet. As the end of the year approaches, the situation is even more dire. It is estimated that the income from the Hankou City Tax, business tax, and land tax from various counties totals 300,000 yuan, which is a reliable source of funds. The central government has provided 350,000 yuan, and a special tax subsidy of 456,000 yuan. These funds will not be available at the beginning of the year, and the monthly deficit in the future will be approximately one million yuan. Although Chairman He has proposed the issuance of three new taxes, it is feared that they will be difficult to implement due to practical constraints.</p>
<p>▲Construction: Due to financial difficulties, all kinds of construction projects have been unable to be realized. Even if some construction is carried out, it is only done in a makeshift manner. The Construction Department is essentially a facade. According to the Construction Department's recent report to the provincial representatives' assembly, the most significant achievements include the development of provincial roads, the construction of suburban roads, the establishment of nurseries in various counties, and the implementation of the metric system. However, it especially focused on shipping, mining, and factory construction. However, due to the flood disaster, buildings along the river were destroyed. Therefore, repairing breached embankments, provincial roads, bridge supports, roadbeds, culverts, and restoring agriculture in various counties, as well as promoting afforestation, will be the most important tasks in the future.</p>
<p>▲Education: The authorities in Hubei Province do not neglect education. In addition to Wuhan University, which is a national university, in the first semester of the twentieth year (1931), the provincial Department of Education was in charge of education in the counties, while the municipal Bureau of Education was in charge of education in Hankou. In the second semester, the provincial and municipal governments merged, and the municipal Bureau of Education was incorporated into the provincial Department of Education. The expenses of various schools, libraries, and public education centers were all provided by the provincial Department of Education. The number of students enrolled has increased compared to previous years, but due to financial constraints, it is still difficult to accommodate everyone. In particular, there are too few primary schools, and more than 70% of children are not in school (this is especially true in Hankou City, and the situation is roughly the same elsewhere). Teachers are constantly complaining about their hardships. Currently, the funds for provincial schools have only been issued up to September, and the funds for Hankou schools have been issued up to October. Teachers are constantly complaining about their hardships.</p>
<p>▲Municipal Administration: After Hankou was changed to an ordinary city, He Baohua was appointed as the mayor. Soon after He took office, the city was hit by a flood, and municipal administration could not be started. In particular, the destruction of roads has been criticized by the citizens. Hankou's commerce has been affected by the flood and the decline in public bonds. Its stagnation is unprecedented. Banks are afraid to lend money, and many money houses have collapsed. The special tax, which is known for its vitality and ability to assist commerce, has also become unsustainable because Sichuan goods cannot be transported to Hankou. Under these circumstances, it will be difficult to restore Hankou's prosperity.</p>
<p>▲Disaster Relief: The flood of the twentieth year (1931) was unprecedented in sixty years. The water level of the Yangtze River reached 53.6 feet. Forty-five of the province's sixty-eight counties were affected, covering 169,000 square li, accounting for more than 22% of the total area. The affected population totaled 9.5 million people, accounting for more than 35% of the total population. Wuhan was particularly severely affected, and the number of refugees was also the highest. Although the Provincial Emergency Relief Association, Disaster Relief Branch, and Post-Disaster Relief Committee were established and made every effort to provide relief, refugees were still dying of starvation, cold, and disease everywhere. The Emergency Relief Association and Disaster Relief Branch have now been closed, and the Post-Disaster Relief Committee is handling the post-disaster relief efforts, implementing work relief and agricultural relief separately to provide assistance. However, the province's vitality has been damaged, and Hankou's essence has been exhausted. ▲Bandit Suppression: Banditry in Hubei Province has always been rampant. Kong Helong's gang harasses southern Hubei, while Kuang Jixun's and Xu Jishen's gangs harass eastern Hubei. He Long's and Duan Dechang's gangs harass western and northern Hubei. They suppress each other, and the bandits flee. Among them, He Long's and Kuang Jixun's gangs are the strongest. Therefore, northern and eastern Hubei are particularly severely affected. The initial organization in charge of bandit suppression in the province was the Wuhan Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, which has now been changed to the Special Envoy's Pacification Office stationed in Hubei. He Chengjun, the director of the office, is in charge of all national troops stationed in Hubei. He Long's and Duan Dechang's gangs have been surrounded near Zaoshi by Xu Yuanquan's troops and are relatively easy to annihilate. Kong's gang has fled back to Jiangxi Province, and a portion has fled into Hunan Province, where they are being blocked and suppressed by Guo Rudong's and Xie Bin's troops. For now, there is nothing to worry about. However, Kuang's gang is becoming increasingly rampant. Huang'an has been lost, and Zhao Guanying, the commander of the 69th Division, is said to have died in battle. The Pacification Office has dispatched the 33rd Division under Ge Yunlong to advance and suppress the bandits at full speed, which may slightly blunt the bandits' edge.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Re-surveying the Junction of the Yellow River in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong Provinces <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>▲The Ministry of Interior Asks for a Report on the Situation of River Affairs in Shandong</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The lower reaches of the Yellow River in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces are subject to river disasters every year. Although prevention and repair are not easy, there are many reasons for this. One of the long-standing causes is that each province governs itself and there is no overall plan. The purpose of this year's Yellow River Conference is to organize a joint Yellow River Affairs Association of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces to enable the three provinces to jointly study methods for preventing and controlling the Yellow River. The Shandong River Affairs Bureau is currently preparing to convene the River Affairs Bureaus of Hebei and Henan provinces to discuss the methods of organizing the joint association. The issue of the Yellow River provincial boundary, which has been a matter of dispute for many years, is also an unresolved issue. For example, Shandong is located at the lowest reaches of the Yellow River. The upstream provincial boundary is intertwined with those of Hebei and Henan. If a dangerous project is located in Province A and a breach occurs, Province B will suffer. Province A does not want to do its best to defend it because it is not in its own interest, while Province B, although wanting to do its best to defend it, is limited by its administrative boundaries and cannot act beyond its jurisdiction. After repeated delays, the river embankment has breached. Therefore, Shandong has repeatedly requested that the provincial boundary be redrawn. Furthermore, the different organizations and funding of the River Affairs Bureaus in each province also make it difficult to achieve a unified effect. At today's (29th) provincial government meeting, the Secretariat submitted a report stating that the Ministry of Interior had sent a consultation regarding the case of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces sending personnel to re-survey the boundary and requesting a report on the situation and funding of river affairs in Shandong. It was decided to discuss them together and order the Construction Department and River Affairs Bureau to discuss and review them before forwarding them. The Ministry of Interior's consultation is transcribed below: (1) The Yellow River River Affairs Conference, according to the temporary proposal of members Li Shutian, Sun Fushe, Chen Zhansi, etc., requested that the Ministry of Interior revise the boundary near the Yellow River in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong to avoid the interlacing of the Yellow River embankments to facilitate defense. It was resolved to send it to the Ministry of Interior for adoption and implementation. It is recorded in the minutes. The boundary near the Yellow River in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces is intertwined, which causes many obstacles to embankment defense. It should be re-surveyed to facilitate river defense. However, this matter concerns changes in the administrative area of ​​the province. According to the provisions of the Provincial and Municipal County Boundary Survey Regulations and the Outline of the County Administrative Area Consolidation Measures promulgated by the Ministry, all administrative areas that violate the natural terrain of the land and the convenience of administrative management must be effectively consolidated. How should the administrative areas of the counties on both sides of the Yellow River be rectified and redrawn? It is proposed that your provincial government, together with the Hebei Provincial Government, promptly appoint commissioners in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the Boundary Survey Regulations to conduct on-site surveys, and then jointly propose a consolidation plan, along with diagrams, and submit it to the Ministry for review and submission to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for approval and promulgation to facilitate administration. In addition to distributing it, it is appropriate to consult and request your consideration and handling, and hope to see a reply. (2) Regarding the Yellow River River Affairs, the Ministry convened representatives of relevant agencies and water conservancy experts at the Ministry's meeting. According to the proposal of the representative of the Henan Provincial Government, the organizational law of the River Affairs Bureau of each province and the measures for clarifying and standardizing the official system of river affairs should be formulated. In addition, the representatives of the Hebei and Henan Provincial Governments jointly proposed to restore the official system of river affairs to emphasize the authority and facilitate implementation. After joint discussion, the principles were approved, and the Ministry of Interior would formulate the organizational measures of the Yellow River River Affairs Bureau and submit them for approval and implementation. The minutes are recorded. The organization of the River Affairs Bureaus in the lower reaches of the Yellow River varies from province to province and should be improved to achieve a unified and consistent effect. However, the organization of the River Affairs Bureau is closely related to the complexity of river works affairs in each province and the amount of confirmed funding. Overall planning is important, but local conditions should also be taken into account. At the beginning of the deliberation, research should be as detailed as possible to avoid obstacles during implementation. Your provincial government should separately ascertain the status of river works affairs in this province, the amount of confirmed funding each year, the current organization of the River Affairs Bureau, the number of prescribed personnel, and the opinions of your provincial government on revising the organization, and propose a reply for reference and verification. In addition to distributing it, it is appropriate to consult and request your consideration and handling.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Prelude to the Alliance of the Five Southwestern Provinces <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>▲Southwestern Provinces Foreign Affairs Association Established in Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The southwestern provinces have recently realized that, due to the environmental situation, they must unite to deal with the current situation. Since Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi reported that foreigners in Vietnam were disturbing the border of Guangxi, the southwestern authorities have become more justified in carrying out joint actions. Therefore, representatives of the southwestern provinces initiated the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Southwestern Provinces Foreign Affairs Association in Guangdong. In the middle of this month, a preparatory meeting was held, and six principles of the association were decided as follows: (1) The Southwest will cooperate and unite against foreign aggression. (2) The National Government is requested to convene a Southwestern Border Defense Conference immediately and establish a Southwestern Border Defense Committee. (3) Request the National Government to prepare military supplies in advance, and build fortresses along the southwestern border and complete southwestern transportation in sections. (4) Actively organize the militias of the southwestern provinces as a backing for the government against foreign aggression. (5) Strictly guard against national traitors who undermine the Southwest's unified anti-aggression actions. (6) Organize a foreign affairs support association, and immediately appoint preparatory members from each province, including: Sichuan (Li Boshen, Jin Fulan, Huang Shengxiang), Yunnan (Zhou Bogan, Gao Xuan, Yang Maozhang), Guizhou (Wang Xiaogong, Zhang Yunliang, Wei Xiangmo), Guangdong (Huang Linshu, Huo Guanghe, Li Renren), Guangxi (Wang Xunzhi, Liu Fan, Wang Gongdu), a total of fifteen people. An office was set up at the Asia Hotel on Changdi. After holding two preparatory meetings and telegraphing the authorities of each province to send responsible representatives to Guangzhou for a meeting, in addition to the representatives from Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong, Long Yun from Yunnan Province also appointed Xiao Choumin, the president of the Hong Kong Fu Dian Bank, to come to Guangzhou to discuss everything with the local authorities. After the representatives of each province arrived in the province one after another, the Southwestern Foreign Affairs Association held an inaugural ceremony on the 22nd at the auditorium of the Provincial Party Department on Dadong Road. The opening ceremony was held at 1 p.m. in the afternoon, and more than 100 comrades from various provinces in Guangdong attended the meeting. Yang Maozhang, the representative of Yunnan, was elected as the chairman. Bai Chongxi attended the meeting and gave a speech, hoping for three points: (1) The association should publicize the situation of foreign oppression as much as possible to awaken the people to unite against foreign aggression. (2) Establish a Southwestern Bank so that the people of the Southwest and overseas Chinese who return to the country can have faith in it, so that they can invest and start industries with peace of mind. (3) Promote transportation in the Southwest. The roads in the Southwest should be connected first to facilitate transportation and connect the railways of the southwestern provinces to strengthen national defense. Then, Zhou Bogan and Du Zhiyuan from Yunnan reported on the current situation in Yunnan Province and the situation on the Yunnan border. Finally, Gao Xuan reported on the preparation process of the conference. After the report, discussions began and the following matters were resolved: (1) Approved the conference charter. (2) The conference declaration was handed over to the members for revision. (3) Submit to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government and the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, requesting the realization of the six principles set by the association. (4) Invite armed comrades from the southwestern provinces to become honorary members of the association. (5) Publish publications and organize branches in various provinces. (6) Raise funds, which will be collected by the executive and supervisory committee members from various provinces. (7) The executive and supervisory committee members will be elected by the preparatory committee members of each province and the members of the province. The results of the elections must be reported to the association within three days and will be ratified at the next general meeting. (8) It was decided to hold another meeting at 1 p.m. on the 27th.

<h3 id="e64">Founding the Luoquanlou Han Painting Hall <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲Scheduled to Open on New Year's Day Next Year</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Library has made great efforts to collect ancient books and bronzes and stone inscriptions in recent years, and its collection is growing richer every day. Recently, it founded the Luoquanlou Han Painting Hall, which will be displayed in the original Hutianyijiao Building of the library. It is scheduled to open on New Year's Day of the 21st year (1932), and rubbings of the brick and tile inscriptions from the Shangtao Studio will be made for circulation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Inscriptions on Bricks and Tiles from the Shangtao Studio: The Gao family in Weixian, Shandong, has the most bricks and tiles from the Qin and Han dynasties. This summer, they sold them to the Japanese for 2,000 yuan. The Provincial Government Education Department learned of this and detained them in Qingdao. After several negotiations, they were transported to the Jinan Library for preservation. The inscriptions on bricks and tiles from the Shangtao Studio are original rubbings by Gao Hansheng. At that time, a total of four copies were made, and those who obtained them cherished them. According to the investigation, one of these four copies is now at Yanjing University. The paper is small and the rubbings are very rough and not complete. Xu Shichang and the Shandong Library each have a copy, and another copy is in Weixian, which is priced at 500 yuan. Wang Xiantang, the current director of the library, has made eight rubbings of the Qin and Han dynasty bricks and tiles obtained from the Gao family for circulation. All 600 types are in one copy, which is still named Inscriptions on Bricks and Tiles from the Shangtao Studio (it is said that the rubbings are 12 types more than Gao Hansheng's original version. 12 types, such as the Qin 12-character brick, were lost in Gao's original version and have been reconstructed).</p>
<p>▲Han Painting Hall: The painting hall has a large number of Han dynasty stone carvings, large and small, with a total of 50 pieces, of various styles. They are all inlaid on the walls. This spring, three particularly ancient tomb door stone carvings were transported from Weixian. The upper part is three goats, which means "Three Yangs Bring Prosperity". Below are two stones, carved into human figures, which are Shentu and Yulei. After being transported to the library, they were also inlaid on the walls, still in the shape of a tomb door. There is also a very good stone carving of the Emperor's chariot, but unfortunately it was purchased by the Germans. The library only has a rubbing, which is now hanging in the Han Painting Hall.</p>
<p>▲Luoquanlou: There are many spring collectors in Shandong, especially Chu Weiyuan of Laiyang, Ma Zhuwu of Licheng, Liu Yanting and Wang Jimen of Zhucheng, and Li Zhupeng of Lijin, all of whom have special books published. Among them, Ma's Hongou Huaxuan Spring Collection is exquisitely and extensively praised. Later, his manuscript writing board spring coins were taken away by his son-in-law Li. In the thirteenth year of Guangxu (1887), a book was printed with the remaining boards and circulated. After several changes in the world, they were scattered and lost. Last spring, Li's descendants donated 610 original carved boards of ancient springs and spring collections to the library, and 114 boards were obtained from the market, totaling 724 boards, 1,229 items, extensively collected and cited, forming a grand view. They are now displayed in the Hutianyijiao Building, renamed Luoquanlou, with the spring collections arranged on shelves according to their original categories, such as tools, coins, knife coins, and round laws. Their genealogy is listed separately, outlining the evolution, and the arrangement is clear. It is currently being arranged and is scheduled to open on New Year's Day next year for public exhibition.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Tao Ye Gong Proposes Conscription to Save the Country <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Tao Ye Gong intends to submit a proposal for conscription to save the country at the National Crisis Conference and the National Salvation Conference in the near future. The main reasons are as follows: "Today, the foreign crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, and the people of the country are loudly calling for resistance to foreign aggression. All are paying attention to expanding military preparations. At the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Mr. He Xiangning and Mr. Wang Qi proposed the implementation of conscription, and the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Representatives Assembly also made the same proposal. I believe that China is in a desperate environment and everyone should achieve this goal. According to the results of China's past conscription, in the late Qing Dynasty, the 9th Division of the Jiangnan Army once implemented partial conscription. At that time, young people with lofty ideals and patriotic ideas enthusiastically responded to the call, and the seeds of revolution were also widely spread among the soldiers. The Xinhai Revolution was so easy to achieve because it was effective. When the European War broke out, Mr. Jiang Baili, the former principal of the Military Officer School, saw the intensity of the war and suggested to the Beijing government that it also advocate the implementation of conscription. He delineated two areas, Jingzhao and Heluo, as conscription pilot zones, and established a conscription training institute in Beijing, which was directly under the command of the office. Former middle and lower-level military officers were students, and they were taught special conscription subjects and the conscription systems of various countries. Three classes graduated successively, with several hundred people, who were assigned to various places as conscription commissioners. The effect was gradually evident. Unfortunately, the warlords of the Beiyang government wanted to maintain their private armed forces, like those who eat likin rice and do not want to cut likin taxes. Therefore, they came out to obstruct it in many ways, resulting in its interruption. If it could have continued at that time, then today there would have been a situation of all the people in the country being soldiers, and how could it be so vulnerable to a single battle? Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of conscription and recruitment are obvious. To name a few of the major ones, no matter how large the number of standing troops under the recruitment system, it is ultimately limited. Once it fights against the enemy, there is no replenishment, how can it continue? Under the conscription system, the number of orderly discharged veterans increases with age, and there is no need to worry about the lack of replenishment of troops. This is one. The recruitment system is mercenary in nature. Recruits are motivated by money, and are either unemployed hooligans or long-term bandits in the camp. Therefore, in the past, China had the saying "Good men do not become soldiers". With this kind of person carrying weapons, how can one hope that they will not disturb the people? Those who are conscripted under the conscription system are all educated, have a clean family background, and are employed. With good quality, they will be able to inspire the spirit of sacrificing themselves to save the country, in order to achieve decisive victory. This is two. The recruitment system takes money as a prerequisite. In today's China, when the people are poor and the finances are exhausted, huge amounts of military pay must still be spent to support useless soldiers. If this continues, all policies will be abandoned and the country will be bankrupt in the end. The conscription system is completely obligatory in nature. The state does not provide military pay to soldiers, except for providing food and clothing. Therefore, huge amounts of money can be saved to ease the country's financial resources. This is three. The warlords can recruit troops at any time and anywhere to expand the strength of their private armies under the recruitment system. The conscription system has certain laws and procedures to restrict it, and soldiers also have a considerable understanding and will not be used by them. Then the warlords will not rely on it, and internal wars can be avoided. This is four. Today, although China is oppressed by the unequal treaties of the imperialists, it is not as restricted by the Treaty of Versailles as Germany and Austria, which restricts its military preparations. Therefore, it is necessary to rise up in time and defend ourselves with force. It is imperative to implement conscription. I hope that a unified government will be established, a national defense plan will be determined, and a conscription order will be promulgated at the same time. A conscription committee will be established in the central government to actively prepare and implement the conscription plan in the shortest possible time, so that it can fight against the enemy and secure our humiliation.</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Fall of Huang'an <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhao Guanying's Fate Unknown</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The 69th Division, trapped in Huang'an, was overcome by the bandits on the night of the 22nd of this month (December) after running out of ammunition and food, and failing to receive reinforcements. The county town was breached with heavy casualties. Division Commander Zhao Guanying fought bravely and was seriously wounded; his fate is unknown. In the two years since the Red Bandits have been seizing cities and territories, there has been none as rampant as this time. Huang'an is located in eastern Hubei, bordering Anhui Province to the north, connected to Macheng in the east, Huangpi in the west, and bordering Huanggang to the south. It is the most culturally developed area of Hubei Province. When the Revolutionary Army arrived in Wuhan in 1926, their party manipulated from within, secretly planting forces. The counties in eastern Hubei were especially cultivated, and the banditry in the corner of Huang'an was even more severe. Later, after the separation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, followed by the Guizhou clique's "purification of the countryside," many were killed with broadswords and axes. However, the Red Bandits of Huang'an still held their mountainous terrain and resisted the enemy with all their might. Except for the county town, the rest was within their sphere of influence, and the government troops could do nothing about it. The Huang'an County Magistrate could only sit and guard the empty city, issuing orders that only extended five miles. Later, Xia Douyin, as commander of the 13th Division, concurrently served as the Hubei Provincial Garrison Commander and engaged in purification and suppression. Xia was from Macheng, Hubei, and many of his officers and soldiers were from Huang'an and Macheng, making them extremely familiar with the terrain. After encircling and suppressing for some time, the banditry was slightly curbed. However, the areas of Qiliping, Taohuadian, Hekou, and Shanting in the county still could not avoid being the bandits' lair. This year, Li Mingzhong was appointed as the Pacification Supervisor of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei Border Area, and Huang'an was within his defense area. He once used several divisions of troops to conquer the bandit nest of Qiliping, and the bandits fled to the border areas of Henan and Anhui, allowing the area to be slightly at peace. At that time, the garrison in Huang'an was Zhao Guanying's 69th Division and Li Dingwu's New Third Brigade. Unexpectedly, two months ago, Li's unit suddenly received orders to move to Echeng, and Zhao's unit also received orders to move elsewhere. Li's unit moved first, and Zhao temporarily stayed to deter the area because the 33rd Division that was supposed to take over had not arrived. With a single force, the bandits took the opportunity to steal and attack. Zhao's unit was reorganized from the Henan Army, totaling about five or six thousand people. Their equipment and ammunition were not very sufficient, and their food and pay were extremely strained. It was a great struggle for them to resist fierce bandits such as Kuang Jizhu and Xu Jishen, so they held on to the Huang'an County town to await reinforcements. At that time, the Red Bandits attacked the city with all their strength, and at the same time mobilized other units to gather at Taohua Hekou, blocking transportation. Zhao's unit's supplies could not be transported, and reinforcements could not arrive immediately. Zhao himself has always been known for his bravery and skill in battle, and fought fiercely with the bandits more than twenty times, all without success. Deputy Division Commander Wang Yiqun rushed to Wuhan, tearfully begging for troops. On the 22nd of this month, the bandits increased their troops to attack the city, and the city was breached the next morning. Zhao fought bravely and was seriously wounded; his fate is unknown. What is rumored on the roads is that he has already been killed. The deaths of the people and the loss of property are even more uncountable. It is truly a great disaster. Deputy Division Commander Wang Yiqun, after hearing the news in Hankou, immediately rushed to Huangpi to collect the remnants of the troops nearby, and telegraphed the Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office, requesting condolences for the dead and wounded officers and soldiers, to commend the loyal and brave. The original telegram is as follows: "Hankou Resident Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office Director He Junjian, Huang'an is located in a remote border area, with dense mountains and forests. As early as 1927, it fell into the bandit area. The army turns pale at the mention of it, regarding it as a dangerous path. This division was ordered to advance and suppress, and immediately advanced in the rain, breaking through the enemy at Ta'ergang, Jiashanzhai, and Fengxiuyi, and was finally able to arrive. After taking over the defense for five months, there was not a day without fighting, and every battle was fierce. Until mid-October, Taohua, a natural barrier, was blocked and the 33rd Division did not come. Hekou, a strategic point, the Provisional Third Brigade left without defense, delaying the deadline. Transportation was blocked, the dangerous city was isolated, and the lone army struggled, holding on for three months. The ground was frozen and the sky was cold, and people were still wearing summer clothes, trapped in a heavy siege, without food or ammunition. Still, they tempered the morale of the troops, encouraging each other with public loyalty, embracing the determination to perish with the city, and the courage to achieve benevolence and take righteousness. Knowing that weak wood cannot bear a heavy burden, and its strength will inevitably break, but after receiving the order, they did not dare to consider the gains and losses. In the last month, there were more than twenty battles, with countless dead and wounded, and moans filling the city. On December, the day of nourishment, the reinforcements failed, and the bandits attacked even more fiercely with all their strength. At this time, there was no grain left in the city, and the doors of the people were burned. They fought with white blades, and flesh and blood flew everywhere. They killed the enemy with empty stomachs, and moaned to their death. The tragic situation cannot be described in words. The disparity between the crowd and the few, and the different situations of the host and the guest, were different. The city was breached at dawn, and Division Commander Zhao fought bravely and was seriously wounded; his fate is unknown. Only a thousand or so people escaped. Most of the rest are missing. I am at Wulidun, five miles north of Huangpi City, collecting and reorganizing them. In recent days, about three thousand scattered officers and soldiers have gathered. After slightly reorganizing them, I will ask for plans to complete the unfinished work of Division Commander Zhao and avenge the defeat of all the officers and soldiers. Knowing that the army has been defeated and the city has been lost, I am filled with shame and embarrassment. Although I have done my best, my heart still feels uneasy. I hope that Your Excellency will reward the hearts of the people and encourage the future, and give some comfort to the living and give condolences to the dead and wounded. I am collecting the troops and waiting for orders in Huangpi. I respectfully telegraph and ask, and respectfully await your instructions. Deputy Division Commander Wang Yizhao of the 69th Division of the Army respectfully kowtows, (December 30th)"</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Course of Gan Bandits' Intrusion and Capture of Wuyuan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan Dispatch: Since the tense situation, the Red Bandits of Jiangxi Province have become increasingly rampant. Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, Zhou Jianping and other groups in northeastern Jiangxi have also taken the opportunity to move, hoping to revive. Last month, the main force of Fang and Shao were attacked by the 9th Division of Jiang Dingwen and Lu Xiaochen's division in Geyuan, Beiban, Yiyang, and the Ninth District of Guangxin. Although they were defeated, their strength was not greatly damaged. Recently, the troops of Fang and Shao's 10th Army, the First and Second Regiments, Tang Zaigang, and others, are also rushing to advance to northern Jiangxi, coveting the border between Anhui and Zhejiang, and seeking a new base. For a month, the troops have been galloping left and right in the intermediate counties of Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang, engaging in large-scale activities. Although their goal is to take Zhejiang and neglect Anhui, the counties on the Zhejiang border, such as Kaihua, Jiangshan, and Changshan, have security teams and defense forces stationed there, which are easy to dispatch. If the bandit army enters, they can be resisted immediately. Moreover, places such as Huabu in Kaihua have been occupied by the bandits taking advantage of the gaps, and they have plundered wealth, fulfilling their wishes. Only the territory of Anhui is coveted. Wuyuan is the first important gateway in southern Anhui, bordering Dexing, with weak defense forces, but with a false reputation for wealth. Fang and others have coveted it for a long time. This time, they suddenly attacked Wuyuan City. It is heard that they had previously scouted that the city's defense garrison had been withdrawn and the local self-defense force was unable to resist. On the 16th of this month, Tang Zaigang, Zhou Jianping, and others led their Red Army and spearmen teams, totaling more than 2,000 people, and attacked Badu, Xinjian, Haikou, and Wuyuan City in Dexing at the same time. Zhou led a part to attack Dexing, and Tang led a part to attack Wuyuan, both at the same time, in order to connect the two places. It happened that the Wuyuan County Magistrate, Qi Feini, had left his post to go to the province a week ago. The city defense police team, due to the border situation being quiet for days and the alarm of attacking the city becoming a common word, did not suspect any accidents, and their defenses were lax. On the day before the bandits attacked the city, some of the bandit army had already disguised themselves and sneaked into the county town, planting willows between the city's moats as a pre-arranged internal response. At four o'clock in the morning on the 17th, Tang led his troops straight from Tongbu to the outside of the West Gate of Wuyuan City, occupying Lion Mountain outside the city. (This mountain is high and steep, and the entire city can be seen clearly.) (First, they sent a commando team of more than a hundred people, holding wooden ladders to climb the city wall, recognizing the willows and firing guns. The lurking plainclothes team in the city also fired guns in response. The guards and squad leaders at the West Gate heard the alarm and got up to escape, but were shot and killed in bed by the lurking bandits. The Northwest and South gates were also opened at the same time, and the bandits occupying Lion Mountain immediately fired horns and drove into the city in detachments. Suddenly, gunshots rang out everywhere, and bullets were like a string of pearls. At this time, all the residents in the city were still dreaming. When they heard the gunshots and woke up in shock, it was too late to escape. Order was immediately thrown into a chaotic state. After the bandit army entered the city, Tang's bandit headquarters occupied the Mei Hua Li kerosene warehouse in the west of the city. The rest of the detachments surrounded the agencies, and those who suffered looting were the County Higher Primary School. When the school's sounding bell rang, the bandit army took it as a warning. A group of dozens of Red Bandits rushed straight into the school, destroying the equipment at will. The students' suitcases and bedding were all moved out, and the school director, Cheng, teacher Wang Shaotang, and three students were arrested and interrogated at the bandit headquarters. At the same time, the County Government and the Police Division, and the Self-Defense Corps of the First District, were all surrounded. Fortunately, most of the police team got up early to prepare and quickly escaped through the back door, firing guns to cover their escape. Both sides fought in the streets. A part of them scattered, and a part of them escaped through the East Gate. The Self-Defense Corps, because the Ziyang Academy where they were stationed had a better terrain, led the members of the corps by Corps Leader Zhan Yunxing to fight desperately, killing four Red Bandits, and leaving the city from the North Gate. Later, they encountered a bandit army and fought fiercely for an hour. Because the crowd was outnumbered, they retreated to Wukou in the northern countryside. As for the bandit army besieging the County Government, they searched for the weapons of the guards in the government, and arrested Section Chief Yu of the Second Section. They also divided into groups to search the Daya Warehouse and food warehouse, and released the prisoners from the prison. Then they used umbrella clothes to set fire, burning everywhere, reaching the front door of the County Government. The poor people, men and women, who lived next door, fearing that their houses would be affected, knelt down and begged not to destroy them, and were spared. The rest of the flower hall, inner rooms, prisons, granaries, etc., were all set on fire, turning them into empty rubble. The church north of the city was also affected. The priest of the church, because he couldn't hide in time, was taken away by the bandits. Other shops and wealthy residents were all entered and searched by them. After this thorough search, the walls of the streets and alleys were covered with slogans and announcements, signed with the names of Tang Zaigang, Chairman of the Jiangxi Northeastern Provincial Committee, etc., in the Gregorian calendar 1931. The bandits also ordered shops and residents not to close their doors, otherwise they would be burned and the residents would be shot. Therefore, the shops and residents all had their doors wide open. More than 500 spearmen outside the West Gate, each holding wooden and bamboo sticks, divided into groups to move cloth, silk, foreign goods, bedding, clothes, salt, oil, food, groceries, etc., from the merchants in the Chengjia Street area of the West Gate. For a time, boxes and bags were piled up, accumulated in the riverbeds, and hired boats to load them, just like unloading cargo at a port. When the bandit army went to the store to buy things, they gave the value with current silver and copper coins, or with their own poor people's securities. The shop assistants had to accept them obediently and dare not refuse to use them. On this day, all the bandit army and more than a thousand spearmen searched the city from six in the morning to eight in the evening. The merchants' possessions were looted. At about nine o'clock in the evening, the bandits suddenly ordered the team to line up and camp at Lion Mountain outside the city, leaving only dozens of staff bandits stationed in the Chamber of Commerce, demanding 150,000 yuan, otherwise they would burn it down without pardon. At this time, the chairman and standing committee members of the Chamber of Commerce had already fled. Finally, several shop assistants represented and maintained it, repeatedly begging the bandits to reduce it, and they agreed to pay 50,000 yuan in cash. In order to avoid the suffering of the whole city, the representatives tried their best to raise money from all sides, but only got 7,000 yuan. They reported to the bandit leader that it was difficult to raise money, and it was impossible to meet the number of 50,000, and they agreed to reduce it to 10,000 yuan. The representatives also went to different places to dig, deeply suffering that they could not find a wealthy one, and there was no way to raise money. It was already noon at night, and the bandits urged them very urgently. They had to hand over the 8,000 yuan that they had collected. At this time, the bandit leader could no longer wait, and actually detained Wang Huayin, a partner of the Qian Yuan Pharmacy, and instructed him to quickly prepare 2,000 yuan to redeem him. Then he ordered all of them to withdraw from the county seat, lined up and set off, and also took away the Catholic Church priest, Wang Shaotang, and Section Chief Yu of the county government, and other six people. The looted property, the important ones were carried by the spearmen, and the secondary goods were loaded by boat, divided into water and land escorts, and retreated to the Dexing border along the original road. On the morning of the 18th, there was no trace of the bandit army in Wuyuan City, but no one was in charge of security, and the situation was still chaotic. It is estimated that the number of Red Bandits who attacked Wuyuan this time, including the spearmen, was about 1,600 to 700 people, of which one-third had guns, half of which were unarmed fake weapons, and bullets were also scarce. The losses inside and outside the city were the heaviest in the Chengjia Street area of the West Gate. The East and South gates were less damaged because they were remote. Among them, the biggest losses, in addition to the County Higher Primary School, were Jichang Pawnshop, Lishun Cloth Shop, Zhongde Xile Foreign Goods Shop, Meihua Li Kerosene Warehouse, Hexingxiang Grocery Shop, Ruisheng Cloth Shop, and wealthy households Jin Xinpu, Hu Quanchen, Sun Qintang, etc., more than a hundred families. Other losses of one or two hundred yuan are countless. Among the residents who were shot and killed, there was a woman in the north of the city, a tailor, a pedestrian, and four policemen. The loss of firearms was about thirty. It was a huge disaster in Wuyuan since the Hong Yang Rebellion. At this moment, the parties in the city and countryside have gathered to discuss and plan to handle the aftermath. The police team and self-defense corps who fled to the countryside have also returned to the city yesterday to take charge of security. Division Commander Ruan of the 55th Division stationed in Leping, after receiving the telephone call from the Jingdezhen Chamber of Commerce and the request for assistance from Wuyuan, agreed to send Zhang Brigade stationed in Dexing to lead the Wu and Wang regiments to Wuyuan to defend and suppress the bandits. It is heard that the Han battalion can arrive in the county seat first today. Now, the people's hearts have gradually stabilized, (December 22nd).</p>

Jinan may be able to win with Li Shijiu, but at that time, Lehua is thriving and cannot be compared to its previous declining state. In that case, the outcome is difficult to predict.

<p>Donghua has been in an advantageous position in various cup competitions organized by the Westerners' Association. The Schot Cup has reached the semi-final stage.

<h3 id="e91">Selects Chinese Representatives <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>▲ To attend the Shanghai International Games</p>
<p>▲ To face the Malayan and Nanhua Teams</p>
<p>丨Zhou Xianyan and seventeen others丨</p>
<p>The Chinese Football Association Committee held a meeting at Dentmore yesterday at noon. Attendees included Le Xiurong, Feng Jianwei, Zhong Guoquan, Ma Detai (representing Zhou Jiaqi), Zhou Jiaqi (secretary), to discuss and decide on matters related to the selection of this year's Chinese football representatives and the adjudication of protests. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Selected the representatives of this year's Chinese team to attend the Shanghai International Games, as well as matches against the Malayan and Nanhua teams. Feng Jianwei was appointed as the team manager to handle all related matters. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan (Donghua), Lu Zhongen (Lehua), Li Ning (Donghua), Feng Yunyou (Jinan), Jiang Shanjing (Jinan), Zhuang Shihong (Jinan), Tu Kaiyuan (Donghua), Liang Shutang (Jinan), Chen Jiaqiu (Donghua), Chen Pu (Donghua), Chen Zhenhe (Jinan), Dai Linjing (Donghua), Qiu Dongyan (Jinan), Chen Hongguang (Donghua), Mei Hongbao (Jinan), Qian Jingyong (Donghua), Chen Yutian (Donghua).</p>
<p>2. The Cuihua team protested the outcome of the match against Jianjin. According to the referee's report and observation of the situation at the time, the protest did not match the facts. Furthermore, the Cuihua team unilaterally filled in the match report with a score of 3-2 in favor of Cuihua (the actual result was a 2-2 draw), knowingly committing an error. The matter was handled without due diligence, so it was resolved that the protest was invalid, and the match result remained a 2-2 draw.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Not Removing Garden Weeds Zhai Fu Talks</p>
<h3 id="e103">Three Questions and Three Answers for the New Year (Part 1) <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Not Removing Garden Zhai Talks Weeds (Once upon a time, a king took three questions to ask a hermit, saying: "Who is the most important person? What is the most important thing? What is the most important word?")</p>
<p>If China's 400 million Adou wanted to ask me these three questions, I would not hesitate to answer:</p>
<p>Young people are the most important people; cherishing young people is the most important thing; speaking justly for young people is the most important word.</p>
<p>In recent years, young people have been chopped down like radish heads, basket after basket. The chopped heads can be used to build a mountain, and several great men sit on the mountain, drinking and bowing. I now inform His Majesty Adou that from now on, the government must not be allowed to kill people, especially young people.</p>
<p>1. Killing cannot stop killing. "Killing to stop killing" is a superstition. Those in power always believe "killing one as a warning to a hundred." This is no different from the imperialists' mantra of "war to stop war." In reality, war invites war, and killing invites killing. Generally, there are two types of people the government wants to kill: one is bandits forced by hunger and cold; the other is political enemies with different beliefs. Bandits cannot be stopped by killing; bandits will stop when hunger and cold are stopped. Political enemies see being killed as achieving benevolence and dying as martyrdom. Killing them is like pouring soup to stop boiling water. As the ancients said well, "If the people do not fear death, why use death to frighten them?"</p>
<p>2. Killing is the behavior of a madman. A person with hatred in their heart, like a madman or a lunatic, will kill. "Politics is righteousness." The government should not have hatred, so how can it kill?</p>
<p>3. Killers are unkind. Mr. Sun Yat-sen encouraged people to practice loyalty, filial piety, integrity, righteousness, benevolence, love, and peace. Benevolence and love mean not liking to kill people. Killing people with people is the worst kind of unkindness.</p>
<p>4. Killers are unwise. The French Revolution could not tolerate the scientist Lavoisier, which was unwise of the French people. Who can guarantee that among the countless young people killed in China in recent years, there are not a few talents like Lavoisier? To put it another way, the cost of raising a very ordinary person from childhood to the age of twenty is at least two to three thousand yuan. Now someone throws three thousand or two thousand silver dollars into the sea, can that be considered intelligent? Those who have the ability to tame a tiger always want to catch a live tiger, because a live tiger is much more useful than a dead tiger. Only clumsy hunters kill tigers. Tigers should not be killed, let alone people? We should know that if the killing intent does not stop, it will inevitably lead to mutual killing. In the end, it is just using someone else's knife to kill your own people.</p>
<p>5. Killers are not brave. Killing does not stem from hatred but must stem from fear. The government should not have hatred, let alone fear. How many lives are buried in this irrational fear!</p>
<p>6. Mr. Sun Yat-sen wrote a couplet: "Cultivate the righteous spirit of heaven and earth; emulate the perfect people of ancient and modern times." The righteous spirit of heaven and earth is the virtue of loving life. None of the perfect people of ancient and modern times did not embody the virtue of loving life, and none of them approved of killing people. Confucius said of Emperor Yao: "Only Heaven is great, only the Emperor emulates it." Because what he practiced was the way of Heaven, the way of kings. Yao was a perfect person in China. As for Shun's exile of Gonggong, release of Huan Dou, killing of the Sanmiao, and execution of Gun, he was far inferior to Yao. Ancient perfect people abroad, such as Sakyamuni and Jesus Christ, all forbade killing. "Cultivate the righteous spirit of heaven and earth; emulate the perfect people of ancient and modern times" cannot be achieved with empty words; it must be issued as a political order, starting with the abolition of the death penalty.</p>
<p>7. Specific measures for abolishing the death penalty are listed below:</p>
<p>A. All capital crimes shall be changed to life imprisonment;</p>
<p>B. Find an island by the sea that can accommodate hundreds of thousands of people to cultivate and work as a place to educate and rehabilitate these prisoners;</p>
<p>C. Establish large-scale science museums, libraries, farms, forests, handicraft factories, and mechanical factories on the island for various prisoners to study and learn skills;</p>
<p>D. Establish other life-necessary institutions on the island for prisoners to regulate their lives;</p>
<p>E. The entire island shall have one chief supervisor appointed by the government;</p>
<p>F. The entire island shall have an unlimited number of supervisors appointed by the chief supervisor, or selected from among the prisoners who have appropriate qualifications;</p>
<p>G. Prisoners who make scientific discoveries or create inventions in their work may regain their freedom.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Please Start from New Year's Day <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>Friends. Today is New Year's Day. Think of the suffering of the people, the many difficulties of the nation. If you compare it to this day last year, how much more sorrow it brings. In this brand-new New Year, who doesn't feel a sense of imperfection? However, today, at the starting point filled with vitality, I hope everyone will engrave the following points in their hearts and never forget them. I also sincerely pray that everyone, especially young men and women, will "do" them practically. Only then will it be good.</p>
<p>1.  Starting from New Year's Day, get up every morning before dawn and exercise the body for thirty minutes to invigorate the blood circulation throughout the body, making it as strong as steel, in preparation for going to the front lines to defend against insults and share the national crisis.</p>
<p>2.  Starting from New Year's Day, continue to read books and newspapers that are beneficial to body and mind for at least one hundred and twenty minutes (add one time allowance including breaks).</p>
<p>3.  Starting from New Year's Day, practice a simple life, saving on clothing and food, living in peace, getting used to labor, cultivating a full spirit, and demonstrating a loyal and responsible attitude.</p>
<p>4.  Starting from New Year's Day, everyone should automatically eliminate all vanity consumption, such as drinking, smoking, gambling, decorations, etc., and develop a personality free of bad habits. Furthermore, donate the money saved to national salvation funds or other public welfare funds.</p>
<p>5.  Starting from New Year's Day, everyone should expand publicity and penetrate into the people, so that every Chinese person does not use a single cent of enemy goods and clenches their teeth to use less of the foreign goods that economically invade us. On the one hand, strive to find ways to produce, improve and manufacture our country's original materials, and transport them to various countries to recover our previous losses.</p>
<p>6.  Starting from New Year's Day, have a righteous and bright mind and a concept of serving society and putting public interests before private ones. Based on human love and mutual assistance, unite sincerely to correct the reality of social morals.</p>
<p>7.  Starting from New Year's Day, the inherent courage, spirit, and heroic demeanor of every young person should be promoted and magnified as a whole.</p>
<p>Get up, get up. "The plan for the year lies in spring, and the plan for the day lies in the morning." These words are so true. Get up, get up, countrymen, dear young men and women. Please start from New Year's Day.</p>

<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>Another year has easily passed. It's New Year's Day again. The Republic of China was founded, and now it's the twenty-first year. I will now share some superficial views for conversational aid.</p>
<p>Our country has suffered many humiliations at the hands of the Japanese, but the Twenty-One Demands are the most severe. Now, as the twenty-first year arrives, I hope that the people of the country will firmly remember the Twenty-One Demands and work hard to resist Japan in order to wash away this humiliation. So that after twenty-one years, there will be no more Twenty-One Demands. Countrymen! Twenty-one, twenty-one! Startling and terrifying. Washing away humiliation and striving for strength depends on this year. Twenty-one is the beginning of the character "共" (gong, meaning "common" or "communist"). This year, be careful to prevent the communist party's slight movements. Fortunately, below "共" is "八" (ba, meaning "eight"), which is a symbol of separation. Perhaps within the communist party, during the twenty-first year, they will voluntarily separate and collapse.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek held power for the longest time, but he stepped down and left in the winter of the twentieth year. Some say that the character "蔣" (Jiang) begins with "廿" (nian, meaning "twenty"), so he could not continue to the twenty-first year.</p>
<p>Someone might ask, "What sign does General Ma Zhanshan, who fights against Japan with his lone army, have in the twenty-first year?" I say, how can it be said there is none? The character "馬" (Ma, meaning "horse") in the rhyme category clearly indicates twenty-one. Therefore, the horse of the twenty-first year must become a pillar of the country. Some people heard this and clapped their hands and laughed.</p>
<p>▲ Errata: In the previous day's "Idle Chats from the Weed-Free Studio" in Shen Bao's "Poetry School," A, "用" (yong, to use) was mistakenly written as "因" (yin, because) in the discussion of using corners for business. B, "間" (jian, between) was mistakenly written as "問" (wen, to ask) in "無間他我汝" (no gap between him, me, you). C, "示" (shi, to show) was mistakenly written as "亦" (yi, also) in "示别於奴工畜工" (distinguishing between slave labor and livestock labor).

<h3 id="e107">The Story of Two Soldiers' Buildings <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Owner of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>▲ Prologue</p>
<p>Recently, I wrote a long episodic novel for Shen Bao called "The Story of Two Soldiers' Buildings." At first glance, the name seems to be a cliché of legendary descriptions of talented scholars and beautiful women. But the story in this book is not like that when written by my clumsy pen. What I want to write is a whole story with ingenious structure. And the nature of the story is perfectly in line with ordinary modernity. Although the title is only about "The Story of Two Soldiers' Buildings," it is not a beautiful and splendid marriage. The two protagonists, a man and a woman, are neither a heroic warrior-scholar nor a female hero like a general. However, their marriage was formed during the military period. When this period passed, all their hopes disappeared like bubbles, and their marriage came to an end. The general plot is about a top university student who is dissatisfied with the marriage arranged for him by his family. He has two other lovers outside, one is a female student, and the other is a famous prostitute who has married a wealthy man. Later, because his hometown suffered from bandit disasters, his parents died, and all his assets were lost. The famous prostitute could provide him with money and find a way out for him. So he abandoned his love and betrayed the female student, resolutely marrying the famous prostitute. Finally, with the power of the famous prostitute, he obtained a clue from the concubine of a certain military governor and was drawn into becoming a military officer. He also appeased and incorporated the bandits who had killed his parents into the army. The famous prostitute was also complacent and became a very prominent military officer's wife. In this process, the female student who lost her love, whose father was originally a greedy county magistrate, was accused of dereliction of duty due to a case, and her situation became very bad. She joined the army hospital as a nurse and fell in love with a lame doctor. Unexpectedly, the doctor had another most sad love story and could not accept her love, which made her feel very resentful. However, this unfaithful man, after his success, brought his only surviving weak younger brother by his side and sent him to the model youth army to enlist. Who knew that this ignorant child often hung out with his sister-in-law and the military governor's concubines, causing a bit of ambiguous suspicion and suffering a major blow. When he personally sent this dying younger brother to the hospital, he unintentionally met the female student again. However, she looked down on him even more. Because of the misfortune of his deceased younger brother, he was very afraid of losing his official position and tried his best to please a certain military governor again, seeking out the most beautiful street performer to be sent to the military governor as a concubine. But that girl also had another lover and used a passive resistance to move the generous heart of a certain military governor, who released her and sent her away with money. However, he was still promoted to the commander of the guard brigade, and everything went smoothly. He continued to be a good official. Several years later, the military governor was defeated and fled in despair. The street performer and her lover worked as boatmen and rescued the military governor from the encirclement out of gratitude for their previous kindness. At the same time, he also lost his job and resigned, hiding in the concession. When he was an official, both husband and wife spent lavishly and did not save much money. After some time, the military governor was unlikely to rise again, and they became extremely poor. The famous prostitute recalled the past, like a strange dream. Once she woke up, she deeply felt that staying together like this was harmful and useless to him. She advocated going their separate ways and looking for a way to make a living. She also advised him to return to his hometown to salvage the remnants of his life and die as a reformed person returning to his roots. He bid farewell to the famous prostitute, first found the female student, and was rejected by her. He had no choice but to go home and marry the country girl who was still his fiancée, and lived out his days as a farmer. As for the famous prostitute, her whereabouts are not very clear. Some say she was having an affair with an old man who ran an opium den, and others saw her working as a female receptionist in a barber shop. Gradually, it became impossible to verify. Such a story, with many complex aspects, is written into a twenty-episode episodic novel. It describes love, war, martial arts, and various societies and characters. Naturally, it must be described very faithfully and meticulously to show the life of this era and its cycle of cause and effect. But what I hold is an objective attitude. In addition to describing it very faithfully and meticulously for disclosure and exhibition, so that the general readers can get a little hint or association, there is no subjective meaning of praising or criticizing any aspect or satirizing any character. From the past warlords to these confused men and women, I think they are all victims of the times. They and she are all very pitiful. As for this description in this article, it can be said to be a prologue or an explanation. It has nothing to do with the main text of the novel. It just briefly reports the plot and interest of the book in general. It can also be regarded as an advertisement. This book will be published starting today. I will do my best to write it down without any slackness, striving to complete it in one go. In addition to the copyright belonging to Shen Bao, I also retain the right to make films. If anyone thinks that the plot in the book can be used to make a film in the future, they should first obtain my consent.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Complicated Standard of Currency Price <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>）American Eastern Silver Company, Fei Ersheng（········</p>
<p>The saying that "there is a lack of gold in the world," whether it comes from the mouth of economist Gastsar Cassel or is used as conversational material by ordinary people, has become an indelible fact. At present, most countries in the world use cash gold as the basis of currency price. Since currency is necessary for life, people have a clear understanding of the value of gold. However, in fact, there is always a large amount of cash accumulated in places where industry and commerce are not prosperous, which not only loses the effect of regulating finance, but also creates a tragic fall in the economic system. In recent years, the production of raw gold has gradually decreased, while the world's demand for gold has increased by 2% per year. In contrast, it is increasingly felt that there is not enough cash to supply the basis of currency price. Therefore, the fact that gold is expensive is also undeniable. The prices of goods in various countries in the world are declining. The comparison between daily necessities such as wheat, cotton, and silver and gold is becoming cheaper. Therefore, the call for a complex bimetallic standard arises in response to the times. This is indeed enough to expand the basic position of currency price and to make the prices of goods gradually average and moderate. However, there are doubts about the authenticity of gold and silver. Once the production of silver is insufficient, it is also a serious problem. Reducing the amount of gold contained in legal currency is also a remedy. As for the latest currency price basis, the price index method should be promoted. However, there are two main difficulties: one is to index certain prices and seek a common index for a category, and the other is to weigh wages and rents and other considerations related to creating the index. Whether the index method is successful or not completely depends on the people's faith. The reason why the gold standard is at the end of its rope in the world's finances is also because it has lost the people's faith. Another example is the paper money circulating in the United States, with a cash reserve of only 40%. However, the people's faith is firm, and they believe that a 40% cash reserve meets the purpose of demand. Therefore, the credit of the currency system can be maintained. In fact, the US currency system is in line with the price index. This index is roughly divided into two parts: one part is 40% of the cash reserve, and the other part is 60% of the commercial paper issued by the US National Reserve Bank. The facts are all there. In order to plan the future development index method, it will be noticed by the public. According to the index set by the US Bureau of Labor, there is an index based on 550 prices. Each price has a certain weight, and scientific methods and profound theories are used to make it an index. However, the wholesale price index does not seem to be very suitable for the currency price standard. According to the British economist J. M. Keynes, a change in the real price must have important arguments. The employment situation, the amount of output, the bank's loan limit, the interest rate obtained from various investments, the capacity of new production, the amount of cash flow, the foreign trade statistics, and the average exchange rate must all be studied in detail. Keynes and his famous economists believe that the stability of prices is the goal of our demand. In recent years, various unfortunate attempts to fix prices have even shaken the economic status of several countries. Therefore, many people say that holding on to prices is a bad method. George Roberts of the US National Bank once advocated firmly establishing a system of individual effort, but in reality it is not very in line with the world trend. If this is to seek stability, we will become robots.</p>
<p>What economists call stability is not absolute. Its purpose is nothing more than to prevent special rises and falls and maintain balance. There are also one or two exceptions. For example, when short skirts are popular in the market, millions of yards of cotton cloth have no way to sell and the surplus cotton is instantly piled up into thousands of bales. Another example is that the coffee inventory is enough to supply the whole year. If someone only drinks one cup per meal, even if the surplus is sold at the lowest price, no one will care to buy it. Therefore, the rise and fall of prices, the fall of currency prices, and the theory of supply and demand are all closely related. It is said that the science of creating indexes is still very young. Several scientists are currently researching the method of creating indexes. The fundamental understanding is being changed at present. Therefore, the concept of stability will not be emphasized in the future. The world's civilization is changing with each passing day. The research on currency price standards should focus on the concept of change and ignore the old ideas of stability. At a time when the gold standard is collapsing and the situation is serious, the people's faith is also shaken. It is not easy to rebuild new faith on non-existent objects. However, the people's faith in the government is still firm. Therefore, whether the index method can be effective depends on the government's strong promotion and the people's faith.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Bond Market on the Last Three Days of the Year <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>▲ Market Chaos Leads to Extreme Stagnation</p>
<p>▲ Markets Closed for Four Days for New Year, Reopening on the 5th</p>
<p>▲ An Inquiry into the Bond Market Conditions of the Various Bond Markets of the Local Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange Over the Previous Two Days: As the handover has just taken place, and it is also approaching the end of the solar calendar year, various industries typically have year-end closures. Although the government situation is slightly better, foreign aggression is more urgent than before. Therefore, the situation is very chaotic, and the market is extremely dull. The prices of various bonds only saw a relatively strong increase at the initial opening on Tuesday, but quickly fell back. The market saw substantial changes. As a result, compared to before the handover, in addition to a significant increase in spot prices, futures also generally strengthened slightly. Over the two days, futures trading totaled 10,054,500 yuan, spot trading amounted to 100,730 yuan, futures taxes totaled 2,900,000 for the consolidated tax, 1,780,000 for the salt tax, 1,265,000 for the 20-year bonds, 1,195,000 for the 20-year customs bonds, 1,320,000 for the 1929 Welfare Bonds, 1,015,000 for the 1929 Customs Bonds, 550,000 for the Disbandment Bonds, 725,000 for the Reorganization Bonds, 195,000 for Customs Bonds, 145,000 for the 1926 Consolidated Bonds, and 65,000 for the 1926 Bonds. Spot trading included 26,000 for Consolidated Tax, 16,000 for Disbandment Bonds, 15,000 for 1929 Welfare Bonds, 14,300 yuan for 1930 Customs Bonds, 13,000 yuan for 1929 Customs Bonds, 7,000 for Salt Tax, 5,000 yuan each for Customs Bonds and 20-year bonds, 3,000 yuan for the 1926 Consolidated Bonds, and 1,000 yuan for the 1918 Bonds. However, no 1926 bonds were offered.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Situation: The market situation yesterday continued to be quite calm, and the price trend of various bonds generally remained stable. The fluctuations in the market before and after were still slight. However, observing the market situation, although the domestic and international situations still show little development, the inflow of investment from small investors is quite lively. The market demand exceeds supply, and the prices have all seen a slight increase compared to before. Spot prices for consolidated tax and salt tax, as well as spot and futures prices for 1929 Customs Bonds, have each risen by about one yuan. Other prices have also increased by about thirty or forty cents. Only the futures prices for 1926 Consolidated Bonds and Disbandment Bonds were slightly weak. Spot trading volume in the morning was only 75,000 yuan, including 48,000 yuan for 1929 Customs Bonds, 10,000 yuan for 20-year bonds, 7,000 yuan for Consolidated Tax, 2,000 each for Disbandment Bonds and Salt Tax, and only 1,000 each for 1926 Consolidated Bonds and Disbandment Bonds. Futures trading for the entire day amounted to 5,900,000 yuan, including 1,175,000 yuan for Salt Tax, 1,065,000 for Consolidated Tax, 900,500 for 20-year bonds, 840,000 for 1929 Customs Bonds, 750,000 for 20-year bonds, 545,000 for 1929 Welfare Bonds, 400,000 for Disbandment Bonds, 90,000 for Disbandment Bonds, 5,000 yuan for Customs Bonds, only 20,000 for 1926 Bonds, and also only 25,000 yuan for 1926 Consolidated Bonds.</p>
<p>▲ Future Predictions: Observing the shape of the bond market, it seems likely to continue to be chaotic. However, the stock exchange will be closed for four days starting today and will not reopen until the 5th. During this period, the environmental situation will not be without changes. However, if the environmental situation does not worsen further, it is hoped that the market will continue to strengthen after the New Year's reopening. The statistics of the high, low, rise, and fall of the bond market prices for the three days at the end of the year are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Bond Type    Term/Spot    Highest (Day)    Lowest (Day)    Difference     Rise/Fall</p>
<p>1926 Consolidated   Spot   33.00 (4)    32.80 (2)  0.20    Increase 3.50</p>

<h3 id="e115">Sparse Yarn and Cotton Market at Year's End <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>▲ With the yarn market stabilizing, the year-end season sees most businesses preparing to close their accounts, leading to stagnant commerce. Gatherings in the market are noticeably sparse, resulting in fewer sales by commission merchants, although merchants from Guangdong are still actively procuring goods. A total of just over 400 bales were purchased by various merchants. Market conditions are average. Among the commission merchants, 330 bales were from Guangdong, 75 from inland China, and 10 from Shantou. The standard cotton yarn market is closed for year-end accounting.</p>
<p>▲ Spot Cotton Trading is very quiet, with no significant activity from the factories. The reported source is 320 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially weakened due to selling pressure from the South and reduced buying interest, but later strengthened due to purchases by Japanese merchants. Futures fell by 1 to 7 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by 5-6 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton rose due to a shortage of January Oomras and speculative buying. Flat Gold rose by 8 rupees, Oomras by 3.75 rupees, and White Broach by 5.75 rupees.

<p>▲ Yesterday, the sources for the various merchants in Shanghai South were the 45th and 46th shipments. The inventory at the docks was weak, and sales in urban and rural stores were not as good as yesterday. Examining the source, it is indeed because the year-end is approaching, and all firms are closing their accounts, resulting in a reduced appetite for goods, and the number of transactions is slightly less. Therefore, the market situation is difficult to predict, and a loosening is seen. The price of thick new japonica rice suddenly fell nearly a dime, while thin indica and early rice for New Year's cakes had a weak appetite, and the situation was tiring. Imported Dojong rice sales were balanced, and the market remained stable. Metaphysical Yuan Rice arrivals are limited, with scattered transactions. Wine merchants were average, resulting in prices remaining tight.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday's market at Xinzha saw a surge in ships arriving with white japonica rice from Changshu and Wuxi, and the river inventory was abundant. Coupled with the extremely tight money supply, prices fell again. Sources of Green Tip and Thin Rice continued to arrive, and fewer merchants from the producing areas of Xiashi and Hushui were seen, leading to a sudden increase in shipments. Although transactions in the scattered retail stores were scarce, the market was generally in decline. Arrivals of dried white japonica rice were exhausted, and small amounts of high-quality rice were occasionally moving, with the price per unit increasing by several cents. Only the 4th and 5th shipments of imported short-grain Dojong rice and Du Rice arrived, and there were also river inventories. Although the merchants' intentions were firm, the retail market was sluggish, and prices also weakened by a dime. The North and South markets are uniformly closed for measuring rice today.</p>
<h3 id="e119">New Transactions for Min Party Rice <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, as it was the end of the solar calendar year, transactions for imported rice, both spot and futures, were suspended. Only foreign firms in the consolidated market offered 300 tons of April Min Party rice at a price of 4.7 taels, and there were no other transactions. The future market outlook lacks optimism, and it is unlikely to see a turnaround before the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The End of Sugar Market Transactions <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲ Business Closed for Two Days Starting Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received reports from the producing areas that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.125, and the New York sugar futures prices were 1.13 for March, 1.18 for May, and 1.29 for September, all increasing by one cent compared to the previous report. The spot and futures prices of Javanese sugar remained unchanged. Trading in the local trade association market was settled, and buying interest was even more scarce due to the end of the solar year. The transaction price for 24-grade Dutch raw white sugar was 9.575 taels, and for finely ground white sugar, it was 9.675 taels. There were not many transactions, and the market remained firm. Taikoo Sugar HX mark was 11.525 taels, B mark was 11.7 taels, and HM mark was 11.4 taels. The scarcity of supply was increasing prices. There was demand for Dutch sugar sold at auction to new factories offering raw white sugar at a price of 5.1 yuan per Dutch currency and medium white sugar at 4.95 yuan, but the volume was limited, and the market atmosphere was quite stable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the industry market announced that it will be closed for two days starting tomorrow to celebrate the New Year's Day.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Unceasing Decline in Xinghua Longans and Sundry Goods <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Xinghua longans were previously priced high, inevitably leading to sluggish sales. However, land prices have recently loosened, so the Shanghai market has gradually turned down. The current market price for Zhenger No. 2 from Jiechun is no more than 90 taels, a drop of more than 10 taels from before. The decline for other brands is even greater. Moreover, as the year-end approaches, there is no hope of a turnaround, and it will not be easy for the market to return to high prices in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Active Transactions in Tinplate for Hardware <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Transactions in 35-pound tinplate have been quiet for a long time, and the market trend has been quite cold. In recent days, tobacco companies, biscuit factories, etc., have successively made purchases, making the market more lively than before. Due to excessive sales, prices have not yet risen. The current market price is 38.5 taels per box. It is said that more than 100 boxes were offered in the market yesterday.</p>

<p>Sales of Kailuan Coal No. 1 and No. 2 dust have remained smooth recently. Each time a new shipment arrives, the supply is often insufficient for distribution. According to news from the Fourth Company, the price of the two coal dusts will generally increase by 5 dimes per ton from New Year's Day. Lump coal will also increase slightly.</p>

<p>▲ National Crisis Imminent</p>
<p>▲ Extreme Heartache</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association, in light of the national crisis, issued a special notice to all citizens yesterday to cease New Year celebrations, stating: "Regarding the matter of the notice, this year's New Year's Day coincides with the time when our Northeast Three Provinces are being completely occupied by the violent Japanese forces, due to the border defense commander Zhang Xueliang commanding his troops not to resist. All our citizens feel extreme heartache. At this time when lost territory has not yet been recovered, we should cease New Year celebrations to mark our mourning."</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang's Talk</p>
<h3 id="e126">Regarding the Withdrawal from Jinzhou <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲ The People Must Rise Up Automatically and Expedite Action</p>
<p>▲ Urge the Government to Resist the Violent Japanese</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Feng Yuxiang left by car at 11:00 AM yesterday to visit Xu Qian, Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, and others. He then returned to his residence for lunch with Xu, Li, and others. In the afternoon, he met with reporters from various newspapers and issued a statement regarding the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou. In the evening, he hosted a dinner at his residence, with Liu Yufen acting on Feng's behalf to invite representatives from various circles in Shanghai. It is said that Feng has decided not to leave Shanghai in the next four days, and the trip to Fenghua may not materialize. The news from yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Receiving Guests from Various Circles: At 9:30 AM yesterday, the newly appointed Director-General of Training of the National Government, Li Jishen, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Army Group, Li Zongren, visited and talked for about half an hour. After Li and others left, Zhang Zhijiang, Zhang Fakui, and others met with Mr. Feng and invited Ma Fuxiang by car to talk. After Ma arrived at 10:30 AM, Fang Zhenwu also arrived. The commissioners met for about an hour. Mr. Feng then visited Xu Qian, and Ma and others waited at his residence. He then came with Xu Qian, Li Liejun, and others and stayed for lunch. In the afternoon, Fang Zhenwu, Guo Chuntao, Liu Zhilu, Gan Naiguang, Chen Jintao, Lu Bohong, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Wang Hanliang from the Citizens' Association, Zou Zhongying, a representative from the Labor University, and Ni Yishi and eight other representatives from the Anti-Japanese Association of the Five Southeastern Provinces were all received by Mr. Feng.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding the Withdrawal from Jinzhou: At 4:00 PM yesterday,</p>
<p>Mr. Feng personally shook hands with reporters from various newspapers. When our reporter inquired about the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou and the urgency of the situation in Pingjin, Mr. Feng replied, "Regarding the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou, according to a telegram from my friend, the troops east of Jinzhou defending the area were the three brigades of Rong Zhen's department. When they were still 300 li away from the enemy, the two brigade commanders led their troops to retreat. Another brigade was also affected. When they returned to see Rong Zhen, Rong scolded them for not resisting, saying that if they were so timid, they should not be soldiers. The two brigade commanders actually said, 'If you want to resist, you go resist.' Rong was extremely angry and went to Ping to resign. This is the situation of civil and military officials today. Now that disaster is imminent, these officials cannot be relied upon. Only the people can rise up automatically to urge the government to save itself and the country." As the reporter was about to inquire further about how the people could rise up automatically, Mr. Feng hurriedly bid farewell due to his eagerness to meet other guests, saying repeatedly that they would talk in detail another day.</p>
<p>▲ Details of the Meeting with Wang: Mr. Feng Yuxiang issued the following statement yesterday regarding his meeting with Wang Jingwei: "(Question) What were the details of your discussions with Mr. Wang yesterday?" (Answer) "Yesterday I went to the hospital and visited Mr. Wang at his bedside. After briefly exchanging pleasantries and inquiring about his condition, I explained my ardent hope that various leaders would work together to resist foreign aggression. Mr. Wang was very indignant about the national crisis and was eager to go to Beijing as soon as possible. He said that as soon as his illness improved slightly, he would go to Beijing. At that time, the doctor came in to check his temperature and advised him to rest, so I returned home." (Question) "When will you meet Mr. Wang again?" (Answer) "The time for the next meeting will be notified by Mr. Wang, but it must be discussed with the doctor before the meeting."</p>
<p>▲ Expressing His Intention to Visit Hu and Jiang: When reporters visited Mr. Feng at his residence yesterday, they inquired about when he would visit Jiang Jieshi and Hu Hanmin. He replied that he indeed had this intention, but whether or not he would go was still uncertain. According to inquiries from other sources, the trip to Fenghua may be cancelled because Jiang Jieshi has indicated that he is declining guests. However, the trip to Hong Kong to meet Mr. Hu Hanmin may materialize, but Mr. Feng still needs to consider the recent situation.</p>
<p>▲ Denying That He Brought Plans: It was reported that Mr. Feng Yuxiang came to Shanghai to meet Wang with detailed plans for recovering the lost territories in the Northeast by force. The content was that Feng and Yan would transfer the old departments in the Northwest to the front line under a new system, with a troop strength of about 300,000 men. When reporters went to Mr. Feng's residence yesterday to inquire about whether there were such plans, Mr. Feng's secretary Gao Xinya was responsible for</p>
<p>replying that the above sections were completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>▲ Ye Bin's Visit Yesterday Morning: At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, Ye Bin, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Youth Volunteer Suicide Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps, went to 301 Avenue Mesny, French Concession, to visit Mr. Feng Yuxiang. Mr. Feng had been busy the previous night and had not yet gotten up. Li Weicheng received him on behalf of Mr. Feng. The following is a verbatim record of the order of questions and answers in their conversation: "(Ye asks) What kind of mission does Commander Feng have for this trip to Shanghai, and how many days will he be staying?" (Li replies) "He came to Shanghai to express his condolences to Mr. Wang Jingwei, and he will only be staying for three days." "(Ye asks) What are Commander Feng's thoughts on the recent situation in Jinzhou?" (Li replies) "He is determined to recover the lost territories by force in the near future and encourages the people of the whole country to unite and unanimously resist foreign aggression, and he will never willingly surrender an inch of territory." "(Ye asks) Since Commander Feng is determined to recover the lost territories by force, all members of our corps are willing to serve as a backing. I wonder when Commander Feng will go to Beijing, and our corps is willing to follow Commander Feng." (Li replies) "Very good, Brother will definitely convey your wishes to Commander Feng." Then, Ye Bin, the chairman of the suicide squad, presented a book of inscriptions from the group and asked Commander Feng to write an inscription for posterity.</p>
<p>Li Weicheng agreed to convey the request. Mr. Feng agreed to have a detailed meeting again at 6:00 AM tomorrow. Later, Xing Pu, the former councilor of the Qingdao Municipal Government, also came to visit Mr. Feng, and the chairman of the corps bid farewell and left.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Qun's Banquet This Afternoon: Mayor of the city, Zhang Qun, believing</p>
<p>that Mr. Feng is tireless and enthusiastic about consolidating the leaders of the party and the country,</p>
<p>has specially arranged a banquet for Mr. Feng at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association at 12:00 noon today (New Year's Day), with Kong Yongzhi, Li Xiehe, and Huang Yingbai accompanying.</p>
<p>▲ Inviting Mr. Feng to Speak: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Five Southeastern Provinces yesterday afternoon appointed representatives to visit Mr. Feng's residence on Avenue Mesny, where they were received by Secretary He Chuqiang on behalf of Mr. Feng. The representatives of the association then stated the significance of initiating a mass meeting to welcome Mr. Feng Huanzhang to lead the people, which will be held at the public sports ground at 1:00 PM today (New Year's Day), and requested Mr. Feng to participate in the meeting, speak, and guide the people on the policy of resisting Japan. Secretary He was entrusted to convey this to Mr. Feng, and it is said that Mr. Feng has agreed to it.</p>
<p>▲ Talking with Liu Musu: Shanghai commercial transport representative Liu</p>
<p>Musu, along with Chen Weixin, director of the Road Association, and Ruan Ming, secretary of Li Renchao, visited Mr. Feng yesterday to report on the progress of the people's movement in Shanghai and to solicit Mr. Feng's policy on saving the country internally and externally. According to Liu Musu's statement, Mr. Feng's responses were as follows: "(1) Japan's forcible occupation of the Three Northeastern Provinces is like a robber entering a house with a knife. Everyone in the house should use their legs and arms and do their best to resist in unison, and perhaps they can subdue the robber to death. They must not just watch the robber enter the house and, while he is committing the crime, still want to declare that they are preparing to take up a knife to deal with him. You must know that if the knife is not properly prepared, you will be killed by the robber. What is most peculiar is that a military officer declares non-resistance. I ask, the people pay the soldiers in the hope that they will protect the country and defend the people. Now that the country is in danger, the soldiers are compromising in the hope of wealth and honor. It is better to raise chickens to lay eggs and dogs to guard the house. (2) Democratic politics must be people-oriented. I remember that during the Franco-Prussian War, the French soldiers retreated step by step for three to four hundred li. The people were filled with righteous indignation and, supporting the old and carrying the young, went to the front line to question and scold the retreating soldiers and even used weapons to attack them. As a result, the entire army was aroused and drove back the German troops three to four hundred li. Also, the Japanese people often destroy the residences of congressmen. When asked why, they said that their words and deeds do not match and they deceive our people, so they do so. The police still protect them and never interfere or oppress them. This shows that the people are automatically rising up to save themselves and the country and to supervise the government's administration and finances, or to impeach corrupt officials, which is an undeniable matter. (3) Central officials smoking opium are enjoying life, while ordinary people using opium ash to treat their parents' illnesses are violating the law. Central officials gambling are entertaining themselves and meeting health conditions, while ordinary people gambling are detained or fined. This is completely inconsistent with the spirit of national politics and should be improved as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Jinzhou in Critical Condition</p>
<h3 id="e127">Expressions from the National Crisis Assembly <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>▲Two telegrams from the Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association ㈠ to Beiping</p>
<p>To Military Governor Yu Xiaohou, Brigade Commander Wang Yizhe, and all military commanders of the Northeast: You are all aware that the Japanese have occupied the Eastern Provinces, retreating without a fight, resulting in the loss of national dignity, an unprecedented disgrace. Recently, Jinzhou is reported to be in a state of emergency, and the enemy is advancing further. It is difficult to guess whether the commander-in-chief is determined to fight. Gentlemen, you are all patriotic men. Ask yourselves honestly, how can you face this? The people exhaust their resources to support the army, but one person surrenders to the enemy for personal gain. Which is more important, the people or the individual? Gentlemen, you are the pillars of the nation, not personal slaves. The national situation is in such dire straits that you should awaken early, make a firm decision, rise up in unity, and fight together against foreign enemies, seeking survival for the nation and preserving the honor of soldiers. Do not let General Ma Zhanshan be the only one to distinguish himself. Looking north at your banners, we telegraph this message with tears. We hope you will understand and consider it carefully. Respectfully, from Ma Liang, Feng Jiaxi, Zhao Fengchang, Han Guojun, Huang Yilin, Yao Wenxun, Wang Qingmu, Shen Enfu, Tang Wenzhi, Zhang Yiyong, Ma Shijie, Dong Kang, Zhuang Yunkuan, Li Genyuan, Xu Dingkang, Qin Xitian, Shen Weixian, Huang Qinglan, Mu Xiangyue, Lu Guiliang, Zhu Shaowen, Jia Fengzhen, Yuan Xiluo, and others of the Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association.</p>
<p>㈠ To the Special Foreign Affairs Committee of the Nanjing National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: During this reorganization, the national crisis is intensifying. The people endure tears and look forward to new strategies. Yet, the Japanese invaders are pressing hard, and the Jinzhou army is retreating in disarray. No real resistance is seen, and no plans to respond are heard. We still remember when the Eastern Provinces were first lost, the people were suspicious of the Minister's visit to Japan. The previous government even made critical remarks. The Minister twice stated that the trip to the East was precisely to save the Eastern Provinces. Now that the new government has been established, it should have a plan to salvage the situation and silence criticism, otherwise it will be abandoning itself. The government has a major responsibility to the people. In this time of national crisis and public anxiety, how is national defense being prepared? How will diplomacy be used to fight for our rights? How can the Eastern Provinces be saved? Please determine a major plan and announce it to the people to comfort their hopes. Respectfully, from Ma Liang, Feng Jiaxi, Zhao Fengchang, Han Guojun, Huang Yilin, Yao Wenxun, Wang Qingmu, Shen Enfu, Tang Wenzhi, Zhang Yiyong, Ma Shijie, Dong Kang, Zhuang Yunkuan, Li Genyuan, Xu Dingkang, Qin Xitian, Shen Weixian, Huang Qinglan, Mu Xiangyue, Lu Guiliang, Zhu Shaowen, Jia Fengzhen, Yuan Xiluo, and others of the Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association.</p>
<p>▲Declaration of the Hunan National Crisis Relief Association to All Newspapers and the Public: The Japanese have been plotting against us for over forty years, from the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 to the forced "Twenty-One Demands" of 1915. Our people tend to forget past events, and no countermeasures have been prepared. Now, the violent Japanese are repeating their old tricks, suddenly invading and penetrating deep into our territory, occupying Liaoning and Shenyang, seizing Jilin and Heilongjiang, and recently launching a fierce attack on Jinzhou, threatening North China. They act as they please, treating us as nothing, while we are caught off guard and only known for our non-resistance. For four months since the disaster began, apart from the people boycotting Japanese goods, General Ma Zhanshan defending the territory, and students forming groups to petition, nothing else has been heard. The authorities rely on appealing to the League of Nations to shirk responsibility and appease the people. International relations and negotiations are indeed a possible tactic, but relying on this to seek survival, opening the door to welcome thieves, and waiting to be slaughtered without any resistance is incomprehensible. Now, the National Government has undergone a refreshing reorganization, yet no concrete plan to defend against the national crisis has been heard. All that is heard is that Jinzhou is in imminent danger. The trick of the monkey trainer, giving three in the morning and four in the evening, is at its wit's end. Our people are already in a desperate situation. With the nation destroyed and families ruined, disaster is imminent. We are at a crossroads, heading towards a common end. Recently, people in Jiangsu organized the National Crisis Relief Association to inspire and call upon each other to jointly avert the crisis. As the saying goes, "Though Chu has only three households, it will surely destroy Qin." Following the legacy of Jingzeng and the extraordinary achievements of Huang and Cai, we people of Hunan will certainly not lag behind in defending our country. With this spirit, we have organized the Hunan National Crisis Relief Association in Shanghai, and held its founding meeting on December 30th, declaring our aim to save the country and seek the survival of our nation.

<p>▲Telegram on behalf of the Hubei National Crisis Relief Association (Titles Abbreviated): The sudden onset of the Japanese disaster has shocked the whole country. The people are running around calling out [for help], but the government turns a deaf ear. Thousands of miles of beautiful rivers and mountains are discarded like weeds. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are as cowardly as dogs and sheep. We have a traditional national policy, but lack consistent diplomacy, resorting to wagging our tails for pity, considering co-management as a good plan, bowing our heads to be slaughtered, seeking neutrality and temporary peace, planting the seeds of national and racial destruction, and laying the foundations for the shame of our ancestors. Yet, [the government] suppresses the people's spirit, restricts public opinion, stifles just arguments, and suddenly starts counter-revolutionary prisons, labeling righteous indignation as treason. These are all recent traces of the government and unprecedented painful history of the nation. The people are heartbroken, weeping blood, collapsing on the ground, and crying to the heavens, unable to restrain themselves. Fortunately, peace has been achieved and unification is promising. The advice of contemporary worthies is all good strategy for future reforms. If we can unite sincerely, reform ourselves, correct the wrongs of individual dictatorship, promote democratic and centralized governance, revitalize and save the country, and learn from past failures, the future of the nation will be promising. We are all citizens and have a responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. We fear the danger of a collapsing nest and broken eggs, and dare to express our opinions. We briefly list a few points for discussion. First, politics must be absolutely transparent. In recent years, one-party rule has gradually become a dictatorship. When the people first accepted this rule, they trusted it without doubt. However, the government, holding great power, made mistakes in every action, causing increasing suspicion and endless wars, with national finances shrinking and people's livelihoods suffering. Who can excuse the blame for these mistakes? Recently, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Sun Ke and other dignitaries and elders have telegraphed, advocating either convening a national salvation conference or making politics absolutely transparent, implementing democratic centralization, breaking the one-party monopoly, concentrating talents, and jointly supporting the critical situation. In European and American political reforms, countless lives have been sacrificed and much blood has been shed. People have fought hard, striving forward and succeeding one after another, yet there is still no guarantee of success. But these gentlemen are resolving it with a few words. This is truly an unprecedented record in our country and should be sincerely supported by the people. We hope that they will treat each other with sincerity and put these words into practice, not losing the people's expectations due to changes in the environment. If they can follow this bright path and establish constitutional institutions as soon as possible, so that the people can directly participate in politics and jointly save the country, we deeply believe that no matter how difficult and dangerous the future may be, the people will rise up to jointly complete the great cause of saving the country. Otherwise, sticking to old ways and repeating past mistakes, the lesson of the boat capsizing is not far off. Gentlemen, you are intelligent and do not need much explanation. Second, diplomacy must be resolved independently as soon as possible. Ever since the violent Japanese invaded, the government has retreated step by step, surrendering rights and humiliating the country, causing daily increasing public anger. After unification is completed, it is appropriate for everyone to unite and make preparations for resistance with the determination to die, in order to reverse the decline and save the critical situation. As for how international relations and negotiations should be conducted, and what the limits of negotiation should be, the government should consult with the people openly, with internal and external support, in order to operate flexibly and win in negotiations, reversing the suspicion of private dealings and achieving effective national diplomacy. In the future, the government should not repeat its mistakes and lead itself to destruction. As for the long-standing restriction of freedom of speech, it should be thoroughly lifted as soon as possible. The arbitrary taking of finances should be actively reorganized as soon as possible. Military and civil affairs should be strictly separated, and internal wars and suicides should be absolutely prohibited. How can morale and public spirit be promoted? How can falseness and exaggeration be corrected? The people in the disaster areas must be provided with relief as soon as possible, and local autonomy must be implemented as soon as possible. All these things are fundamental plans for saving the country at present. From the people to the government, everyone should be wary of walking on thin ice and quickly start planning ahead. We have previously read the telegram from Mr. Ma Xiangbo and other elders of Jiangsu Province, which showed their views on national salvation, grand plans and great strategies, and deep insights into current ills. We express our strong agreement with this. We have established the Hubei National Crisis Relief Association without hesitation, following in your footsteps and jointly facing the crisis. Alas, if we do not destroy ourselves, who can destroy us? If we save ourselves, Heaven will surely have pity. We still have a breath, our conscience is not dead, we share the same hatred for the enemy, and we pledge to protect our country. If we receive consistent support from wise men at home and abroad, we will continue to present our views for your consideration. Respectfully presenting our heartfelt thoughts and awaiting your wise guidance. The Hubei National Crisis Relief Association bows.</p>

<p>▲Zhang Qun's Speech Oath supervisor Zhang Qun delivered a speech, saying: "Today is the day that Dai Ji is sworn in as the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Commander. I am very honored to represent the Central Government in supervising the oath. Commander Dai has been working in the military for more than ten years and has achieved remarkable results. This time, because Commander Xiong Tianyi was transferred to be the chairman of Jiangxi Province, the Central Government believes that the position of Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Commander is very important, so it specially appointed Dai to take on this important task. Commander Dai's ability, knowledge, and experience in military affairs are worthy of our admiration, and he will be able to fulfill his duties happily, ensure the security of the Southeast, and promote the close cooperation of the Southeast defense. Shanghai is a place where people from all over the world gather. In terms of area, there are two concessions; in terms of population, there are more than three million people; in terms of population nationality, there are residents from more than forty countries. Its importance is evident. Since the September 18th Incident, the defense of Shanghai has become even more serious. To maintain security, the three party, government, and military organs must cooperate as a whole, and all sectors must also cooperate as a whole, in order to achieve the goal of peace in the Southeast. Therefore, every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, the three party, government, and military sectors must hold a meeting to discuss important matters related to maintaining defense. The tranquility of Shanghai depends on this. It is expected that Commander Dai will make progress in this regard after taking office, and he will be able to bear this important mission. At the same time, I hope that people from all walks of life will cooperate with the spirit of the past. This will surely make Shanghai peaceful and allow politics, diplomacy, and culture to develop accordingly. Although I have resigned from my responsibilities in Shanghai, I will still do my best to help in a private capacity."</p>
<p>▲Guest Speeches Among the guests, Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, said in his speech: "I am very pleased to participate in Commander Dai's swearing-in ceremony today. Shanghai is located in a strategic location, and maintaining security is very important, especially during the national crisis. We must work together. After Commander Xiong resigned, Commander Chen was afraid that he would not be able to take care of both Beijing and Shanghai, so Commander Dai was appointed as the Shanghai Commander again. Zhang Mayor has already introduced Dai's history. Such a capable person will surely consolidate Shanghai's defense." Subsequently, Ye Huijun, Cai Tingkai, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Shiying, and others delivered speeches in succession, which are omitted.</p>
<p>▲Dai's Response Oath supervisor, comrades, fellow soldiers, I am a little sincere and fearful when taking office here today. Why? Because I came from the army. After leaving school, I joined the army and have been in charge of soldiers. I have no experience in administrative organs. Therefore, I have been delayed for several</p>
<p>months in the position of Garrison Commander and have not dared to take office. Especially since Shanghai is vast and the situation is complex, I feel that I am really unable to take on the responsibility. However, the Central Government's orders must be carried out. Since I have no way to get rid of it, I have to reluctantly accept it based on the military's principle of obedience being my duty. However, although my ability is limited, I am confident that I have always had a sense of responsibility. Since I have come to accept it, whether it is good or not, I must continue to do it. As for whether it is done well or not, I ask all sectors of the local community to give instructions and be tolerant. As for the speeches of the oath supervisor and several guests, I will respectfully accept them completely and put them into practice.</p>
<p>▲Inauguration Telegram To All Newspapers: I have received Letter No. 919 of Appointment of Simplified Appointment from the Executive Yuan of the National Government, appointing Dai Ji as the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Commander. This is the letter. I took office in Longhua Headquarters on the 31st of this month. I am a humble soldier with a duty to carry arms. The sea frontier is a heavy responsibility, and I am in fear of the ice abyss. I humbly ask that you give me guidance so that I can follow your instructions. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan, I respectfully announce this. Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Commander Dai Ji bows.</p>

<p>The National Medical Association previously remitted 1,400 national currency through the Bank of China and sent a telegram to慰勞 General Ma Zhanshan. It is known that General Ma sent a reply telegram yesterday, saying: "To the National Medical Association: I have received your telegram and am deeply grateful for your慰勞 and donation. I respectfully lead my comrades in arms to express our gratitude remotely. This government has now moved to Hailun County. The funds have been sent to Harbin to contact the transfer."

<h3 id="e131">Recent News from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued an announcement yesterday regarding the extension of the deadline for registering sealed Japanese goods for another two weeks, until January 9th, saying: "The measures for handling sealed Japanese goods have been previously announced by this Association. All merchants are to come to the Statistics Section of the Investigation Department to obtain forms, fill them out, and submit them to the Statistics Section for compilation and statistics, based on which discussions will be held. Failure to fill out the forms by the deadline will be considered as private possession of Japanese goods. Announcement No. 3 also announced that the deadline would be extended to the 25th of this month. It has now been found that the deadline has passed, and the majority of merchants have not come to the Association to fill out the forms. This is a serious mistake. For the sake of caution, the Committee has decided to extend the deadline for another two weeks, from the 26th of this month to January 9th. Merchants who have not filled out the forms should quickly come to the Association to obtain and fill out the forms during the extended period and should not delay any longer. Please be aware that filling out the forms for sealing Japanese goods is a public measure that benefits all merchants and does not harm them. Please do not wait and see. Otherwise, once the deadline has passed, it will be handled as private possession of Japanese goods. This is to inform you of the situation. Please take note."</p>
<p>In addition, the case of inspectors Ku Shuping and Han Guangfu, who were previously falsely accused of theft by the Zhen Dahai Flavor Store in Xinkaihe for leading a team to inspect a large batch of Japanese goods and were arrested and taken to the Second Special District Court by the French Concession Police, was heard in court at 10 a.m. yesterday. Attorney Qu Zheng appeared in court on behalf of the Association to defend them, and more than ten people, including three committee members, Li Yongxiang, Zhu Xuefan, Chen Peide, and representatives from the Inspection Department, attended the hearing. After the presiding judge questioned the details of the case, he approved bail in court and scheduled the verdict for January 6th. It is said that Attorney Fei Xizhen of the Police Department also knew that the case was a misunderstanding and made some statements, which can be said to have taken care of the patriotic movement within the scope of the law. The two inspectors who were falsely accused were released immediately after finding bail. It is said that Du Yuesheng had spoken to the authorities about this case, so both parties were able to reach an understanding during the trial.</p>

<p>The Minnan Association in Shanghai believed that with the Chinese troops withdrawing within the passes and the entire Eastern Provinces about to be lost, it was inappropriate to engage in revelry and dancing during this time of grief. They telegraphed an appeal to compatriots, saying: "To anti-Japanese organizations at home and abroad and compatriots across the country: In recent times, officials have been keen on seeking advancement, soliciting bribes and offering them without limit, using the excuse of sending gifts for the New Year. Those above them in rank must be congratulated, and those below them in rank will give in return. The motives of these people for celebrating the New Year are fundamentally impure. In order to improve officialdom, it should be abolished and improved as soon as possible. As for civil society gatherings, that may be a different matter, but at a time when the nation is about to fall, who is willing to force a smile? It is reported that someone advocated stopping New Year's celebrations to mark the disaster. Our Association is eager to be patriotic and has unanimously agreed. We hope that compatriots from all walks of life will no longer indulge in revelry and dancing, so as not to be accused of being unpatriotic and despised by other countries." The Minnan Association in Shanghai bows.</p>

<p>▲Public Works Bureau Prepares for Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The Yunzaobang Bridge in Woosung was in disrepair for many years, and traffic was very dangerous. The Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau planned to build a new bridge at the end of Jungong Road, west of the Woosung Railway Bridge, and drew up plans. The project was contracted to the Yujing Company of this city for a price of 87,000 yuan. Since the start of construction in mid-August of last year, it has been four months. The Public Works Bureau specially sent engineer Huang to supervise the construction in Woosung. The construction has been progressing very quickly. It is known that the construction of the bridge has been completed on schedule yesterday according to the Public Works Bureau's planned plan. Only the road surface on the south side of the bridge has not been completed, but it will be completed in about three days. It is said that the Public Works Bureau is now preparing to hold an opening ceremony on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Chen Kecheng, a member of the Municipal Executive Committee, telegraphed the Central Government yesterday to resign. At the same time, he also submitted his resignation to Mayor Zhang as Director of Publicity of the Municipal Government and Director of Training of the Local Autonomy Training Institute. The original telegram sent by Chen to the Central Government is recorded below. To the Nanjing Central Organization Department 转 Central Executive Committee of the Party: Since I, Chen Kecheng, have been mistakenly appointed as a member of the current Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee, I have been ashamed of my lack of talent and have been worried that I would not be able to continue. In the four months since I took office, I have not made any achievements. I have previously requested to resign with all the members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees, but after more than ten days, I have not been approved. Now that the environment is deteriorating day by day and my energy is exhausted, I am making another telegram to resign. I respectfully request that you approve my dismissal from the position of member of the Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee. I am in urgent need of orders. Chen Kecheng bows.</p>

<p>The Chinese Republic Internal National Public Debt Bondholders Association, yesterday sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance, saying, (Telegram to the Executive Yuan) "Respected President Sun of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, having read your telegram from Nanjing, we respectfully acknowledge your esteemed appointment as Premier. From now on, the teachings of the late Premier will undoubtedly be fully realized one by one. We listen with admiration and extend our heartfelt congratulations. The late Premier dedicated himself to the revolution, striving for forty years, but did not complete his great task. We rely on you to inherit his legacy, tirelessly working to maintain the foundation of popular rule and save the doctrine of people's livelihood from imminent collapse. Now, facing national difficulties and the people's suffering, we hope you will embrace their pain, broadly implement plans, care for the hungry and drowning, and combine leniency with severity. Only you can be relied upon. Governing the country has myriad aspects to be addressed, but establishing trust with the people is paramount, preceding adequate food and troops. Although all policies are interconnected, establishing sound finances is the foundation for reforming all policies. Years of war and famine make increasing taxes like draining a pond to catch all the fish. Years of catching mice and digging up their nests make borrowing seem like the end of an arrow's flight. It is not easy to immediately reduce military and government expenses, and expanding construction cannot be just empty talk in the current situation. Under these circumstances, reducing expenditure and increasing revenue should follow the example of Germany, convening a national economic conference to discuss long-term plans, aiming for certainty in implementation. This would align with the late Premier's teaching of cooperation between the people and the government, and the establishment of national credit lies therein. Our association is a group of public debt bondholders, and our relationship with national policy is particularly close. Therefore, we especially offer our congratulations and humbly offer our views. In closing, we express our sincere prayers. The Chinese Republic Internal National Public Debt Bondholders Association respectfully bows and seals. (Telegram to the Ministry of Finance) Respected Minister Huang of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, having read the news, we respectfully acknowledge your esteemed appointment as Minister of Finance. We extend our heartfelt congratulations. You have specialized in economics and have extensive knowledge of national finance. You will undoubtedly be able to make ample arrangements for national expenditure and carefully consider the burden on the people without fail. We can foresee grand plans greatly benefiting the people's livelihood. Since the founding of the Republic, finances have not been on the right track. Excessive and miscellaneous taxes have been layered upon each other, and public debt bonds have come one after another. The people are struggling to cope, and the government is exhausting its resources. Fortunately, the National Government has established its capital in Nanjing, adhering to the teachings of the late Premier, implementing the reduction of customs duties and proceeding with tax increases. The policy regarding public debt bonds is based on financial principles, with a designated fund and custody by people's representatives, and principal and interest are paid on schedule according to regulations. Therefore, in just four or five years, the amount of bonds has reached 100 million, circulating freely in the market without obstruction and stored safely among the people without fear. Unfortunately, most of the funds are used for military expenses and little for construction. Now that unification is complete and the new government is established, the national needs are vast in this time of urgent national crisis. However, with thorough reorganization, there may still be ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure while ensuring national debt. Addressing immediate needs should begin with a financial conference, and establishing a foundation should resemble the group's economic conference. Our association is organized by bondholders and is closely related to national finance. Therefore, we dare to speak out after offering our congratulations, not avoiding overstepping our bounds, but rather offering a humble contribution. In closing, we express our hopes. The Chinese Republic Internal National Public Debt Bondholders Association respectfully bows and seals."</p>

<p>Transit Customs Declaration Industry Conference</p>
<h3 id="e138">Opposition to the New Customs Declaration Form <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>▲Also Opposing Business License in Management Regulations</p>
<p>The entire transit customs declaration industry in this city, recently due to the new customs declaration forms issued by the Jianghai Customs, scheduled to be implemented on January 5th, and the newly issued business license management regulations, are considered unusually harsh and difficult to comply with. They have successively requested a meeting to make a public decision. Therefore, yesterday (the 31st) at 3:00 PM, a general meeting of the industry was held at the Customs Declaration Association on Penglai Road in the Nanshi area. 178 companies attended, totaling over 200 people. Shi Zikun was publicly elected as chairman, who immediately reported the purpose of the meeting, inviting attendees to express their opinions. Representatives from the industry, including Zhang Qingqing, Lin Youzhang, Zhou Jing, and others, successively rose and stated that the new customs declaration forms issued by the customs had many omissions, such as the tax number and the total declaration number, which were previously filled out by customs officials and could not be handled by customs declaration firms. Furthermore, the form grids were small, the items were numerous, and the time limit was short and strict. Errors would result in penalties, making it impossible for the industry to undertake the completion. If the customs insisted on customs declaration firms completing the forms, the industry would lack the time and manpower. They would rather sacrifice business and refuse to comply. The repeated establishment of penalty clauses by the customs was also unbearable. Although the association had previously requested the Ministry of Finance to ban Japanese customs declaration firms in order to maintain national rights, the Ministry of Finance ignored it. Not only did it fail to protect them, but it issued harsh regulations instead, which was truly outrageous. Although the customs declaration industry was a small-scale operation, it did not default on customs duties. Now, requiring a large security deposit was difficult to bear. These harsh regulations were equivalent to sentencing the customs declaration industry to death. Rather than perishing together, it would be better to suspend business. After discussion among the representatives, they unanimously requested the chairman to protest to the customs authorities and withdraw the order. If the goal was not achieved, they would all suspend business. Subsequently, Chairman Shi Zikun used gentle words to persuade the representatives not to act rashly. Customs declaration firms were involved in transportation, which was related to commerce and finance, and careful consideration was necessary. They should not rely on youthful courage, which could affect the overall situation. However, the public sentiment was angry, and the words were not well received. It was resolved that if the Jianghai Customs could not understand and cancel the new customs declaration forms and harsh management regulations by January 4th, the entire industry would voluntarily strike and suspend business starting on the 5th. Everyone unanimously raised their hands, signed, and passed the resolution. The meeting ended at over 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association, initiated by Xie Fuchu, chairman of the current Overseas Chinese Industrial Advancement Association, has been actively preparing and is now ready. It is scheduled to hold its founding meeting today at No. 2 Zhenxin Nanli, Dongxin Bridge Street, Fada Road. Yesterday, the preparatory office issued a notice stating that since the outbreak of the Liaoning Incident, three months have passed, and the entire country is filled with anger. Although the overseas Chinese have resided in foreign lands for a long time and engaged in business overseas, they have not forgotten their homeland and still cherish their patriotic hearts. They dare not lag behind in the grand undertaking of national salvation. Therefore, based on public opinion, the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association is organized in Shanghai, and responsible personnel have been designated to actively prepare. It has been submitted to the National Government for filing and will begin operations on New Year's Day of the 21st year of the Republic. Saving the nation with iron and blood is a shared aspiration.

<h3 id="e142">Arrest and Escort of Korean Communist Leaders <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲Gu Ranqun and Wen Shanzai</p>
<p>▲Escorted from Shanghai to Korea on the Shanghai Maru</p>
<p>Korean Communist Party leader Gu Ranqun, who was arrested in Shanghai last year, was detained in Shanghai. His party work was then carried out by his secretary, Wen Zongmiao. This time, he was arrested by Japanese detectives for planning to hold a meeting in Shanghai. Along with Gu Ranqun, who had been arrested earlier, he was escorted to Japan and then to Korea. The details of this incident are as follows:</p>
<p>▲The Escort of Gu Ranqun Gu Ranqun, a Korean, served as a staff member in the statistics section of the Central Headquarters and as a political worker in the Military Police Corps after graduating from the Huangpu Military Academy. After being dismissed, he came to Shanghai and joined the Communist Party. He was responsible for the electric extraction sent by the Seoul District Court of Korea and sent to Korea for interrogation.</p>
<p>▲Wen Zongmiao's Activities After Gu's arrest, the position of guiding member of the Korean Communist Party was taken over by Gu's secretary, Wen Shanzai (also known as Wen Zongmiao), who was appointed by the Communist Party. He traveled between China and Korea and contacted Koreans in Shanghai to carry out communist work. Wen Shanzai lived in the French Concession. After receiving a secret report, the Japanese consulate had long wanted to arrest him, but his whereabouts were uncertain, making it difficult to capture him.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Detectives' Pursuit Recently, Wen Shanzai, under the orders of the Communist Party headquarters, was going to Ruijin, Jiangxi, to report on the progress of his work and guidance. He first summoned the Korean Communist Party members under his leadership in Shanghai to a meeting in a house between Zhaopu Road and Tianmu Road to report on everything and instruct them on future work. However, he was detected by Japanese detectives, who ambushed a large number of detectives on Zhaopu Road on the 26th of this month, intending to capture them all at once. Wen also received the news and did not dare to go. Later, he disguised himself and went to Hongkou alone to scout the situation, but was arrested by Japanese detectives and taken to the Japanese Consulate.</p>
<p>▲Transfer to Korea After Wen Shanzai was arrested, he was interrogated by the judicial section of the Japanese Consulate. It was learned that he was directly in contact with the Communist Party headquarters in Jiangxi Province and was the leader and instructor of the Communist Party throughout Korea. The Japanese considered this case extremely important, and Gu Ranqun was also an important member of the Communist Party. When the Seoul District Court extracted Gu Ranqun, the Japanese Consulate sent several Japanese police officers to escort Gu and Wen on the Shanghai Maru to Kobe and then to Korea for a joint trial. When the two prisoners, Gu and Wen, boarded the ship, the wharf was heavily guarded. After boarding the ship, they were locked in separate rooms to prevent escape.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Postal Workers Everywhere Request Promulgation of Special Trade Union Law <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Rural Workers' Union, and the postal workers' unions of Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places, jointly submitted a report to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Legislative Yuan, stating that: "We respectfully request the prompt promulgation of the Special Trade Union Law so that there is a law to follow and it benefits the labor movement. Our unions were organized in accordance with the Trade Union Organization Regulations personally drafted by the late Premier in 1924 and the Special Trade Union Organization Regulations of 1928. Postal workers in various places have also successively organized. The establishment of our unions did not lack a legal basis at the beginning. However, after the success of the revolution and the establishment of the capital, the provisions of Article 3 of the Trade Union Law of 1929 and the cancellation of the Special Trade Union Organization Regulations of 1930 caused the already established special trade union organizations in various places to lose their legal basis, causing confusion among postal workers across the country. The party headquarters in various places felt that guidance was difficult and successively requested explanations. They were pleased to think that there would be a day when a special trade union law would be promulgated for special industries, and people's hearts turned to a certain direction. Unexpectedly, the Implementing Regulations of the Trade Union Law passed on May 25, 1930, had ambiguous wording and difficult to fathom intentions after detailed explanations. Delayed until now, the postal unions in various places, with a close relationship and deep love, still maintain their original organizations. However, with the strictness of the law, how can they conflict with it? With the importance of union affairs, how can they be allowed to wander? Therefore, they have repeatedly expressed their concerns to the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Transportation. We now submit a draft of the Special Trade Union Law and respectfully request that the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Transportation approve the prompt promulgation of the Special Trade Union Law based on the Trade Union Organization Regulations personally drafted by the late Premier in 1924 and the Special Trade Union Organization Regulations promulgated in 1928, so that the original good organizations of postal workers can be further consolidated and serve the party and the country faithfully. We also request that when drafting the law, our unions be allowed to send representatives to attend, fully express our opinions, and benefit the people's will and the effectiveness of the law. We await your urgent orders."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Four Labor Regulations Announced in This City <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The labor regulations in this city, after the implementation of the Factory Law, were explicitly abolished by the Municipal Government. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau separately drafted the Small Factory and Commercial Shop Employee Rules that are not applicable to the Factory Law. It also drafted the Worker Treatment Rules, Worker Service Rules, Commercial Shop Employee Service Rules, and Commercial Shop Employee Treatment Rules and submitted them for approval. They have been amended and passed by the 198th Municipal Government Meeting and were instructed yesterday to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for compliance and promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Collection of Land Survey Fees <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government was ordered by the province to conduct land surveys and collect a land survey fee of one dime per mu (unit of area). However, this year's floods in this province have been particularly severe, and the people's livelihood has been devastated. Wujin and other counties have successively requested extensions to alleviate the people's suffering. It was subsequently approved that those with a harvest of 50-60% or less would be granted a one-year extension to alleviate the people's suffering. This county is not on the list of extensions, so the Finance Bureau has already received from the County Government the land survey fee receipt format issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance and ordered compliance.</p>

<p>▲Advocating Strict Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>▲Fighting the "Long Life Paradise" Case</p>
<p>▲Advocating Strict Opium Prohibition The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association's declaration on advocating strict opium prohibition during the current situation states: "The failure of opium prohibition is a matter of great importance. In fact, the party and the country's prestige has been swept away, and the foundation of the government has been shaken because of this. Is the implementation of the monopoly policy a blessing for the government? How can we know that it has greatly disappointed the people, violated the teachings, and presented a picture of universal disapproval and shame to other nations? The money from sucking the marrow of the people does not all fill the national treasury, but merely creates opportunities for a group of profiteering sycophants to be promoted and get rich. In addition, the disaster of subverting the entire nation is hidden within this. Opium monopoly is an exploitative policy of colonial governments.</p>
