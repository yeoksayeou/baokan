<h3 id="c1">公務技術人員應有保障　彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨日交通部無線電臺技術員工程師多人。因無故被裁。在報端刋登大幅廣告。質問電政司長李範一及國際電信局長王崇植十二點。此一事實之誰曲誰直吾人未明眞相。自未能予以若何之批判。但假如「被裁」而眞爲「無故。」質問各點而皆爲「合理」則吾人不能無言。蓋無故裁撤技術員與工程師。事固微細。而此種現象。則實爲我國今日黑暗政治之縮影。換言之。即官僚政治之具體表現。。而我國今日之病根。則任何人皆知其在於軍閥政治與官僚政治之重新抬頭也</p>
<p>自國民黨誓師北伐以至北洋軍閥次第覆滅。以民主勢力之進展。政治本有澄淸之機。迨黨政府統一全國。舊日之軍閥政客。亦皆搖身一變而爲黨之「忠實」同志。政敵既除。天下大定。軍政大權。由黨之獨裁進而轉入少數人之手。於是而新軍閥新官僚乃應運而生。軍閥政治與官僚政治。即隨之而死灰復燃。比年以來。每况愈。下一幕政治長劇。覆雨翻雲。幾於開歷來未有之變局。軍閥政治與官僚政治之立足點。即爲個人主義。一切純就個人之利益而打算。絕不顧及國家之利益與大衆之利益。故在軍閥政治與官僚政治支配之下。一切多偏私舞弊。用人既不以專門人材爲標準。行政尤不以人民利益爲前提。有眞實專門學識之人材。竟無所用其長。而無專長。者輒據要津。如軍人長交通。敎育家文學家主鐵道。更如一再聲明未嫻政治者。而必强其負内政之重責。材不求其得用。人不求其稱職職。位爲結納聯歡之酬勞。爲安挿私人之工具。冠履倒置紀綱蕩然。尤有進者。軍閥以政客爲爪牙。政客倚軍閥爲靠山。於是一般無恥政客。各擁某一實力者爲中心。樹立派系。壁壘森嚴。門户</p>
<p>各别。互相傾軋。極盡險惡之手段。彼派欣然而來。則此派憤然而去。來者即總攬大權。一派專利。異已者排。無力者撤。親戚故舊。一時皆分得一杯之羹。彼來此去。循環報復。即素稱淸高之敎育界。今亦不免爲官僚主義所侵入。校長必勾結實力。敎員必結納校長。其無派别無靠山而具眞正之學識者。則隨地無立足之點。公務人員。毫無保障。人皆存五日京兆之心。皆不安其所事。斯皆軍閥政治與官僚政治所誘致之惡果也。</p>
<p>吾人今讀交通部無綫電臺技術員工程師之質問。因而倍感軍閥政治官僚政治如不掊覆。政治决無步入軌道之可能。吾人誠不知各技術員之所以被裁。是否亦爲門户派别之爭持。如其爲是。則吾人敢聲請政府當局。最低限度。應注意專門人材之集中。並注意公務人員之保障。</p>

<p>附錄國聯處置中日糾紛經過丙·日本的新政策從前日本的不肯撤兵、所持的理由、爲我國民衆反日甚烈、故撤兵當以日僑之生命財產安全爲先决問題、後因我國政府宣言負責保護日僑、並且說日本如不相信、亦可請中立國派員參加保護工作、日僑安全問題的解决、至爲容易、日本到這時候、知道持這理由的非計、及再變策略、於十月十二日答覆行政院主席九日勸告書中、說在這嚴重情形之下、當務之急、爲恢復中日間友好及合作精神、欲達到這個目的、應請中國先行承認數種基本原則、藉以維持兩國的邦交、中國如能承認這項原則、日本必能立即撤兵、日政府隨時均願與中國政府開始談判云云、但所說五項原則究竟如何、並未加解釋、所以在會議未開以前、各國都知道事已棘手了、</p>
<h3 id="c122">丁·行政院第二次召會的經過 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>（一）邀請美國列席行政院會議的討論這次集會、其中重要問題、爲請美國派員參加行政院工作、未開會以前、英法政府似已獲得美國政府的同意、而美政府亦於未正式被邀請以前、曾向報界宣言、稱國聯若果請美國參加行政院會議、美政府必歡然接受、這宣言發出後、行政院已有騎虎難下之勢、然日本最忌美國與國聯合作、而干涉其在中國的行動、故極力反對、實爲意中的事、因此遂發生所謂憲法問題、</p>
<p>日本的反對美國參加、乃根據國聯公約第四條第五項、該項謂凡未列席於行政院的國聯委員、如遇該院討論一事件與之有特别關係時、得請其派一代表以行政院會員名義列席等語、所以日本說根據該條約的規定、祇有國聯會員才能參加行政院會議、美國並非國聯會員、故在憲法上不能參加行政院會議、今行政院的集會、乃根據國聯公約第十一條、故行政院即欲請美國參加、亦須得全體一致的通過、如是日本可得兩種阻止方法、以爲一定可以打消邀請美國之提案了、不知行政院各國代表視美國的合作、於國聯前途有莫大的關係、無論如何、必要達此目的、日代表於十月十五日致書白里安提出上述原則時、白里安即覆書謂與美國合作一層、是根據日代表曾贊成九月三十日的决議案、該决議案說、行政院應將關於討論中日糾紛經過情形、隨時通知美國、而非根據國聯公約第四條第五項、故以日代表的反對爲誤會、又說如美國願意派員列席行政院非以會員之資格爲之、因其無表决權、至於邀請美國派員問題的本身、亦不過手續問題、故無須行政院全體一致的通過、日代表爲遺延時日起見、復提議將此憲法問題、另行組織一法律專家委員會、詳細討論誰知英外相即詢日代表說、假使行政院設立專門委員會以研究此法律問題、貴代表能否預先接受其報告、於是日代表又借題發揮、回答說不可、白里安乃將設立法律專家委員會之日本提議付諸表决、結果、除日本及德國代表外、餘均反對、主席復將請美國參加之原案提出表决、結果除日代表外、一致贊成此乃十月十五日秘密會議的情形、到十六日開會時、主席宣佈行政院根據昨日的决議、决定邀請美國派員列席行政院會議、希望日代表亦表同情、即日代表說不能變更前意、波蘭代表說、他所以贊成美國列席行政院的理由、　認該議决案爲單獨的事、與國聯憲法之解釋無關、南斯拉夫與那威代表、亦相繼作同樣的聲明、其用意所在、乃認此次邀請美國列席行政院爲根據九月三十日之决議案、而非根據國聯公約任何一條、故不能作爲將來的先例、實則爲預防蘇俄之援例參加、困蘇俄乃非戰公約及太平洋重要國家之一、其地位與美國無異、一塲爭論於此遂告結束、及到同日下午開會時、美國乃派其駐日内瓦總領出席、各國代表曾作熱烈的歡迎、惟日本代表默然不作一語、過後數天、日代表乃說前者日、政府反對美國列席、是因國聯公約解釋的異同、而與美國無關云、</p>
<p>（二）應用非戰公約的運動美國代表既已列席行政院、對於非戰公約的運用、若使無法進行、將失與美合作的意義、所以十月十七日各國代表即行交換關於應用非戰公約第二條的意見、該條意義說、簽約國家遇發生糾紛、不問其原因及性質如何、祗有用平和方法以救解决商議結果、决定由各國政府訓令其駐華及東京外交代表、向中日兩國政府勸告、嚴守非戰公約第二條的義務、并由法國政府以此通知非戰公約簽字各國、作同樣的表示、美國政府得接法政府的通知後、即發出同樣的勸告、我國政府得接該勸告後、曾於十月二十二日答復、内容大意說、中國素來遵守非戰公約、目下日本顯然加以破壞、簽字各國、應立即加以糾正云、日本政府之答覆、於二十三日亦到、内容分爲三點、（一）以進兵東省爲出於自衛、並否認違背非戰公約、（二）日本因欲和平解决中日糾紛、願與中國直接交涉、（三）反控中國政府鼓動國人厲行反日、</p>
<p>（三）關於日本飛機炸錦州的辯論關於錦州的被炸、辯論至爲痛快當我國代表質問日本何以用大機炸錦州的理由、日代表說、中國軍隊正在集中錦州以危害日軍、所以日軍司令部曾派飛機往該處偵察情形、而爲中國軍隊砲擊日機爲自衛起見、乃擲炸彈而去云、施代表謂去年有美國飛機扺東京、因入境手續不合、致爲日本政府所扣留今日本以軍用飛機飛往錦州、不特手續未合而且携帶炸彈、其用必可知况、錦州華軍、并無高射砲、可見日飛機并未被擊、日軍無故損害中國人民的生命財產、行政院九月三十日之决議、已被破壞無餘日代表自知理屈、祗謂彼之意見與我國代表不同無庸多說、而旁觀者尤深憤恨亦表示不滿於日軍的行動、此爲十月十三日兩次會議的大略情形、</p>
<p>（四）十月二十二日决議草案預備的經過由十六至二十二日間、各國代表均努力於决議案起草、這爲是屆會議之焦點、其進行方法、主席先行徴求兩方意見、再與其他各國代表討論、循環往復、根據各方之主張而作草案、然以兩造意見的參差、進行調解、極不容易、當時且有謂白里安因週旋各方、唇焦舌爛、而至害病、則其困苦之情形、可見一斑、聞提出討論的草案、已屬第三改正稿因其前曾有第一第二草稿、而卒被放棄的原故、第一草案内容、對於直接交涉、限期撤兵、兩者兼顧、後因日方反對限期撤兵、而我方反對直接交涉、故被放棄、後一日、謠傳美國政府反對限斯撤兵、及不願繼續與國聯合作、白里安聞之失色、乃召集中立代表、另起草稿、内容放棄限期撤兵、主張直接交涉、此草案經施代表猛力反對後、英外長又得接其駐美大使報告、說美國態度如前、於是第二草案又被放棄、然各國代表以開會已將一旬、深知無法可以變更日代表之態度乃於十月二日、提出第三草稿付諸表决、該草案内容、分爲七點、（一）兩方有遵守九月三十日决議案的義務、根據該决議案日本應於最短期間、撤回南滿路線以外的軍隊、而中國方面應用有效方法、保障日僑生命財產、（二）請兩方注意以前答允不擴大衝突及停止侵犯的諾言、（三）請日本留意以前無併呑中國土地的宣言、及認此項宣言、與國聯公約及九國條約對於遵重中國主權·與領土行政獨立·及完整的規定相符合、（四）要求日本立即開始撤兵、及應於十一月十六日行政院開會以前完竣并要求中國政府即採有效方法切實保障日僑生命財產及聘請中立國入協助中國官員實行此項决議（五）建議中日兩國政府立即派員協商退兵及接收失地辦法、（六）建議兩方、一俟退兵完竣、之後即行直接交涉、以解决關於此次糾紛及滿洲鐵路一切問題、因此兩方宜協組中日調解委員會、或其他同樣的機關、（七）决定於十一月十六日召集會議、重新審查、至必要時、主席得提前召集上述草案内容雖未能便我們滿意、然大體亦能接納我國、定期撤兵及拒絕直接交涉的主張、在外交上說可以說我國的勝利、中日代表聽主席宜讀該案畢即答允各向本國政府請示、</p>
<p>（五）日本的反提案　十月二十三日第十四次會議時、我國代表謂中國政府對於昨日之草案、雖不滿意、然爲求中日糾紛早日解决起見、故决意接受、惟日代表則仍然堅决反對並提出一反提案、内容分爲八項、其第一二三項因與原案之一二三項意思相同、祗有文字的差别、故不贅述、惟第四至第八項、則與原案迥異、第四項大意說、爲恢復和平原狀起見、應請中日政府承認幾項維持兩邦交的基本原則、這樣可使日僑之生命財產、得切實的保障、第五項爲向中日兩方政府建議、立即開始直接交涉以實現第四項的主張、第六項請中日兩國政府各派大員協商退兵及接收失地之辦法、第七項請中日兩國政府以執行决議的情形、隨時報告行政院第八項授權與主席、於必要時得從新召集行政院會議、以審查本决議案執行的情形、（未完）</p>

<p>奪屍活劇最初戰事。既發生於虹口區域。故毘連華界各路。接戰甚烈。惟地處市廛。頗多僻巷。敵既昧於地勢。易攻難守。故每値敗退。陳屍纍纍。而敵於陣亡士卒。輙不願遺棄。嘗聞某次當我軍追擊之際。忽見敵工兵由側方匍匐而進。初意必來助戰。詎行近陣線時。頓足不前。旋覩若輩方欲將其遺屍旗幟等物。狂拾而奔。我軍立以機槍掃射之。竟大半不得生還云。</p>

<p>Machinegun分重輕兩種。重機關槍發明於有火砲後兩百年。一四○○年時。有稱爲Organs者·係由六個以上二十個以下的鎗筒並列而成的。到了十六世紀·荷蘭創造琴砲。德法大戰時。德軍即利用此砲。與密接二十支的自動槍。以爲攻擊防衛之用。一八六○年。Gutoling機關槍出世。一八八三年德人馬克雪姆Maksim氏。發明了自動機關槍。於是技術上。遂大放光明。德皇威廉第一。大爲贊賞。當時我國駐德公使。親見其搆造精巧。曾在柏林親自試騐。果然猛烈無比。急想購置。因每支價値兩百元嫌其太貴。中途解約。這是我國人的短處。其後法國又發明瓦斯自動霍乞克司Hochiks式機關槍。尤爲猛烈。甲午之戰。日本即用馬克雪姆機關槍。到處施其暴力。此時我國祗有少數土槍及舊式步槍。所以不能抵抗。日俄戰爭時。日本又採用霍乞克司瓦斯自動機關機。這兩種機關槍。楊宇靈任東北兵工廠總辦時。曾經聘請德法技師。製造數千支。不知現在已落在何人的手了。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第四回婚約逼人來游移自擾　宼氛掠地去釁始重開於是在這種痴迷的狀態下。對於李問霞順理成章的婚約。就不禁游疑莫决。惶恐莫名了。輾轉反側閙了一夜。到天明才朦朧睡著。這一覺也不知睡了多少時候。忽陡然地被茶房隔窗高聲喚醒。說梁宅有電話來找說話啦。趕忙披衣出去接話。郤正是梁笑雲在電話裏嬌聲說道。我都起來大半天了。你這兩天心上既不舒服。想必用不著上課。那麽。儘彆在公庽裏幹什麽。還不快到我這兒來嗎。他暗暗慚愧。自己起得比一個時髦女士還晚這還有什麽可說的便只好連聲答應就到。及掛上耳機跑回房裏。如火燒眉毛般胡亂洗了把臉。急忙穿上一套西服。及尋著了那金盒子放在口袋内。就再也不容他有考量思索的餘地。更不暇顧及今晚與李問霞還另有後約。只一心一意的要趕往梁家去了。走到公庽大門裏那座賬房門邊。恰有個郵局信差送來了許多信件。内有一封信是寄給他的。賬房先生順便喚住他將信遞上。他匆忙中看了看信皮。認得是堂叔安大奎所寄。但并不是快信和掛號信。料想信内必没有匯欵。微微有些失望。就帶著這封信跑出去。跳上一部熟識的洋車。說明是往梁家。等車子走到大街上。才慢慢拆開那信來細看。誰知不看還好。一看竟使他驚惶失色。又遭逢一種意外的打擊。而另感觸著一番極難受的煩苦。在車上怔住了一刻。郤不料已停到梁家的門首了。昏昏沈沈的跨下車來。開發了車錢。將一封信也塞在衣袋裏。正待前去按電鈴呌門。忽見梁家的門已經開著。門外并另外停了一部包車。認得是魏卓謀所乘坐的。那車夫與梁家的看門人。都在門口站著閒談。見了他這個很熟識的人到來。齊聲向他打了個招呼。那看門的領導他進去。還在半路上笑嘻嘻向他說道。小姐和魏先生都在書房裏呢。他直聞進書房。果見梁笑雲和魏卓謀正在書桌上讀英文。</p>

<p>二十世紀底戰爭，是科學的，但是我國對於科學，是向不研究，自一二八和敵抗戰後，我們就得了一個很好的敎訓，並且感覺到我們槍砲在在落人之後，所以現在我們必須着重科學，用科學方法改造槍砲，現在我且不談改造，因爲我也不是科學家，我所講的就是製造火藥時最有用，並且佔極重要地位底火綿，現在寫出來和諸位研究研究··</p>
<p>火綿是那綿花浸在藥水裏成的，牠的化學公式，是Ｃ６Ｈ７Ｏ２（ＮＯ３）３我們若然粗製牠，可利用紡織塲的屑綿，再那硝酸一分和硫酸三分，各盛於有活栓的陶器壺中，乃慢慢的倒硝酸於硫酸中，那鐵竿漸漸的混合牠，再那蓋覆在上面，現全冷後數小時，更將此混合酸液，注於在冷水中的陶器鉢内，鉢内備有鐵製的架，那乾燥備就的屑綿（即精製綿）浸在這酸中，再那鐵竿攪和，後在鐵架滴瀝牠剩下的酸，如此數回浸漬，綿花消費的酸，從壺注出，一方浸以綿花，此時因硝酸的作用，發着大熱，必須常常那冷水來冷，這鉢内綿花的大部分，因此回的浸漬，變成粗製火綿，等數分鐘後，用鐵鈎取出，這樣粗製的火綿就成功了，</p>
<p>牠的形色，和精製綿花差不多，但是一經熱後，或撞動後，立刻爆發，所以在火藥中佔極重要和最有用的地位，</p>

<p>記得在槍聲砲聲溢滿閘北的時候，我爲了買幾尺粗布跑進我家附近的一家布店。這一家「寳號」很大，，你可由它那佔了很長的一節街面。便可以看得出來。大概是因爲「暴日犯境罷市禦侮」的原故的這「寳號」只洞開了兩扇大門，自然買主們誰都可以進出，果然「生意興隆」，殆有「顧主滿堂」之概。其中的一位掌櫃是我認識的，於是我也客氣十足的照例的問候着；</p>
<p>「生意可好！」「麻麻糊糊。」　　「噢？那末你們却不曾受着戰事影</p>
<p>響呢？」　　「哈哈，不能開市，那能不受影響呢？」</p>
<p>「啊！····」</p>
<p>哼，我懂得了，所謂之「罷市禦侮」，眞使他們受著「暴日犯境」之苦了。於是忿氣不買布直往外走，當走出店門的時候，他還指着一大貨櫃！被某某機關查封的東洋貨對我說；</p>
<p>「你看，這一大櫃的布匹，眞不知」</p>
<p>什麽時候才可以啓封哩。」</p>
<p>我簡直没有適當的話語可以回答他，於是便悻悻地走到街上，這幾句談話始終在我心頭。今天我爲了妻的糾纏又得去「光顧」他的「寳號」，當快近門邊的時候，便看見這布號店門大開，並且在牆壁上換上了一張「長期抵抗忍痛開市」，於是我肯定的想，今天他們該不致於使我難堪了，果然，當我剛一踏進店門，那位相識者便遠遠地喊着；</p>
<p>「早哇！」那末我也再來一句；「生意可好！」「是的呀，昨天開市了哩！」他滿臉春風的迎着我來，甚至和我拉着手。他說：</p>
<p>「春天來了，天淸也暖和起來了。」那末我也迎着他的心理說··「只要和議成了，天下便要太平了</p>

<h3 id="e1">Public Servants and Technical Personnel Should Have Security <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, several technicians and engineers from the Ministry of Transportation's radio station published a large advertisement in the newspapers, questioning Director Li Fanyi of the Directorate General of Telecommunications and Director Wang Chongzhi of the International Telecommunications Bureau on twelve points, due to their unwarranted dismissal. We are unclear about the truth of this matter, and therefore cannot offer any criticism. However, if the "dismissal" is truly "unwarranted," and the points of questioning are all "reasonable," then we cannot remain silent. The unwarranted dismissal of technicians and engineers is indeed a minor matter. However, this phenomenon is actually a microcosm of the dark politics of our country today. In other words, it is a concrete manifestation of bureaucratic politics. And the root of our country's illness today, as everyone knows, lies in the resurgence of warlord politics and bureaucratic politics.</p>
<p>Since the Northern Expedition launched by the Kuomintang until the successive demise of the Northern Warlords, there was an opportunity to purify politics with the advancement of democratic forces. After the party government unified the country, the old warlords and politicians transformed themselves into "loyal" comrades of the party. With political enemies removed and the country settled, the military and political power shifted from the party's dictatorship to the hands of a few people. Thus, new warlords and new bureaucrats emerged in response to the situation. Warlord politics and bureaucratic politics then revived. In recent years, the situation has deteriorated, and a political drama has unfolded, with reversals akin to overturning clouds and rain, almost creating unprecedented changes. The basis of warlord politics and bureaucratic politics is individualism. Everything is calculated purely for personal gain, without regard for the interests of the country or the interests of the masses. Therefore, under the control of warlord politics and bureaucratic politics, everything is biased and corrupt. The selection of personnel is not based on specialized talent, and administration is not based on the interests of the people. People with real specialized knowledge and talent have nowhere to use their skills, while those without expertise often occupy important positions. For example, military men head transportation, and educators and writers control the railways. Furthermore, those who have repeatedly stated they are unfamiliar with politics are forced to bear the heavy responsibility of internal affairs. Talent is not sought to be used effectively, and people are not sought to be competent in their positions. Positions become rewards for networking and socializing, and tools for placing private individuals. Rank and protocol are reversed, and discipline is lost. Furthermore, warlords use politicians as henchmen, and politicians rely on warlords as backers. As a result, shameless politicians each embrace a certain powerful figure as their center, establishing factions with strict boundaries and separate doors.</p>
<p>They engage in mutual infighting, employing the most sinister means. When one faction arrives happily, the other faction leaves angrily. Those who arrive seize all the power, monopolizing the benefits, excluding dissidents, and removing the powerless. Relatives and old friends all get a share of the pie for a time. They come and go, repeating the cycle of retribution. Even the education sector, which is usually known for its integrity, is now inevitably invaded by bureaucraticism. Principals must collude with powerful figures, and teachers must curry favor with the principal. Those without factions, without backers, and with true knowledge have no foothold anywhere. Public servants have no security at all. Everyone lives with the mentality of being in a temporary position and is not at ease in their work. These are all the evil consequences caused by warlord politics and bureaucratic politics.</p>
<p>Reading the questions from the radio station technicians and engineers of the Ministry of Transportation, we feel all the more strongly that if warlord politics and bureaucratic politics are not overthrown, politics will never be on the right track. We truly do not know if the dismissal of these technicians is also due to factional disputes. If that is the case, then we dare to ask the government authorities, at a minimum, to pay attention to the concentration of specialized talent and to ensure the security of public servants.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ceasefire Conference Nearly Breaks Down <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Our side insisted that the Japanese army should complete the withdrawal in four months. The Japanese side only agreed last night to request instructions from Tokyo and decided to continue the discussion tomorrow afternoon. The fourteenth general meeting of the ceasefire conference was held at the British Consulate last night. Based on the first of the three compromise solutions proposed by British Minister Lampson, the issue of the deadline for the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army was discussed. Our side proposed an amendment, insisting that the Japanese army complete the withdrawal within four months. The two sides argued fiercely, and it nearly broke down. After the meeting adjourned, the Japanese side did not agree until late at night to request instructions from the Tokyo government. The general meeting was scheduled to reconvene at 3 p.m. tomorrow, Monday. The military subcommittee met at 10 a.m. yesterday to discuss the issue of where our troops would be stationed but reached no result. It was scheduled to reconvene at the same time tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Deadline for Troop Withdrawal <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The fourteenth ceasefire conference was originally scheduled to be held at 3 p.m. yesterday. However, since the issue of the deadline for the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army had been discussed to the last five minutes, British Minister Lampson made pre-meeting contacts in order to understand the true instructions of the Chinese and Japanese governments. The general meeting was postponed until 5 p.m. First, Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi went to the British Consulate at 12:15 p.m. yesterday to contact the British and American ministers, which lasted about an hour. Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi exchanged opinions with the British and American ministers at the Cathay Mansion in the French Concession from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. After 5 p.m., the representatives formally met at the British Consulate to continue discussing the issue of the deadline for the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army based on the instructions of the Chinese and Japanese governments. British Minister Lampson initially proposed three compromise solutions at the Thursday meeting: ㈠ The Japanese side issues a separate declaration, the wording of which is that the Japanese army hopes to completely withdraw within six months when the local situation progresses to ensure safety; ㈡ A joint declaration between China and Japan, that is, after the Japanese side's above declaration, add a statement from our side, the wording of which is that China believes that this agreement has not yet been fulfilled until the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army; ㈢ Our side issues a separate declaration, the wording of which is that China believes that the spirit of the League of Nations resolution and this agreement have not yet been fulfilled until the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army to the Public Concession and the extraterritorial roads in the Hongkou area. This has been recorded in this newspaper. The Chinese and Japanese representatives then requested instructions from their respective governments to choose any one of the solutions. This reporter learned that at yesterday's meeting, the Chinese and Japanese representatives each based their governments' instructions on the first of the three compromise solutions for discussion. Our side believed that the wording of the declaration was empty and vague, and that the six-month deadline was too long, so it proposed an amendment, insisting that the words "hope" in the declaration be changed to "earnestly hope" and that the six-month deadline be changed to three months. The Japanese side firmly disagreed with the three-month deadline and argued for a long time. Our side then expressed that it would change the deadline to the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army within four months. The Japanese side still refused to agree. The British and American ministers then suggested that both sides request instructions from their governments again. However, the Japanese side still insisted and finally agreed to consider on its own after the meeting whether there was room to request instructions from the Tokyo government and agreed to reply after 8 p.m. The meeting adjourned at 6:50 p.m. and assumed that the meeting would reconvene on Monday afternoon. After the meeting adjourned last night, the Japanese delegation held its own meeting, decided to request instructions from Tokyo, and notified the British Minister to convey the message to our side. The meeting tomorrow was also decided to be held as scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Our Side's Meeting <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, our attending representatives, feeling that the situation was serious and that there was a danger of a breakdown, immediately went to Vice Foreign Minister Guo's residence for a meeting. Those present were Guo Taiqi, Dai Ji, Huang Qiang, Xia Qifeng, Guo Dehua, Zhang Sixu, etc. During the meeting, our representatives decided that if the Japanese side refused to continue the meeting next Monday, our side would decide to telegraph all discussions from the formal meeting on the 24th to the League of Nations for a fair decision by the League of Nations special meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Subcommittee Meeting <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The military subcommittee continued its meeting at 10 a.m. yesterday. The Japanese representatives then</p>
<p>based on the discussion in the general meeting, transferred the issue of our army's stationing in Pudong and south of the Suzhou Creek, which was submitted to the committee for discussion, requesting our representatives to explain whether there were Chinese troops stationed in the above two places, and if there were no troops stationed now, whether the Chinese side would station troops there after the Japanese army withdrew, and requested the Chinese representatives to give a definite explanation so that the Japanese army could withdraw with peace of mind. Our representatives immediately refuted this and said that the Japanese representatives' inquiry obviously involved China's territorial sovereignty and exceeded the principles of the League of Nations resolution and the ceasefire agreement. The Japanese representatives deliberately based the discussion on the cases submitted by the formal meeting, thereby violating the League of Nations resolution and the ceasefire agreement, and repeatedly created complications. If the meeting breaks down in the future, the Japanese side should bear full responsibility. After our representatives finished speaking, the Japanese representatives tried their best to defend themselves and said that the Japanese side's desire to understand the issue of troop deployment in Pudong and south of the Suzhou Creek was entirely to avoid threats during the troop withdrawal. Our representatives then said that during the war, when our troops were stationed in Pudong and south of the Suzhou Creek, our side was unwilling to use them as a base to attack the Japanese army, let alone when the Japanese army was withdrawing, and the Huangpu River, the Public Concession, and the French Concession were enough to serve as barriers. How could the Chinese army attack the Japanese army? Now there is also proof from the neutral country's committee, so there is no need to worry too much. Therefore, for the sake of sovereignty and for the sake of respecting the League of Nations resolution and the principles of the agreement, our side resolutely refused. At that time, the Japanese representatives repeatedly argued, and even said that China should not station troops wherever there are Japanese residents. Our representatives said that if that were the case, then the Chinese army would have to avoid wherever Japanese residents go, and the discussion was getting further and further away. The military attachés of friendly countries then suggested that both sides request instructions from their chief representatives and decided to discuss again at 3 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Press Communique <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The press communiqué of the fourteenth general meeting of the ceasefire conference last night said that the meeting discussed new suggestions on the timing of the Japanese army's withdrawal on the evening of April 9. The press communiqué of the military subcommittee yesterday afternoon said that the military subcommittee continued to discuss the adjustment of the Japanese army's withdrawal and the Chinese army's defense areas submitted by the general meeting and made no progress. The meeting adjourned at 12:30. The Jiji Press reported from Tokyo on the 9th that the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army carefully discussed the mediation methods of the four-nation ministers regarding Minister Shigemitsu's request for instructions, and as a result, issued the following instructions to Shigemitsu last night: In the second and third cases, unless there is evidence that China has fully implemented the ceasefire agreement, it is feared that China will use excuses to avoid the roundtable conference. Therefore, the Japanese government supports the spirit of the first item, but there are the following two attachments: 1. The Japanese side hopes that the situation will improve within six months. This does not mean that the Japanese side accepts the withdrawal of troops to the concession and the adjacent concession area within six months, but only hopes that the local situation will improve so that withdrawal is possible. 2. The roundtable conference must be held in connection with the above Japanese statement.</p>
<p>The Jiji Press reported from Tokyo on the 9th that Foreign Minister Yoshizawa has already telegraphed Minister Shigemitsu that the Japanese side has adopted the first method of the ceasefire negotiations. The Japanese side accepts the first item as its final concession. However, according to a communiqué received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese representatives did not agree to accept the three mediation methods of the four-nation ministers at the meeting on the 7th and requested instructions from their home government. The foreign affairs authorities believe that if China still maintains such an attitude at the next meeting, then the ceasefire negotiations can be said to be hopeless.</p>

<p>The people of the country must not have a mentality of reliance. A special telegram from Kunshan on the 9th said that this morning, I visited Commander Cai to inquire about his opinions on the prospects of the ceasefire conference. According to his reply, observing the attitude of the Japanese side, they are always cunning and protracted, deliberately delaying, wanting nothing more than to dissipate our public opinion, slacken our military morale, and ease the international situation, hoping to station troops in Shanghai, hold our throat, and occupy the Northeast for a long time as a basis for a world war. Therefore, our country can only be strong and unyielding, and resist to the end. I asked, since Japan has no sincerity, why doesn't our side refuse immediately? He replied, this is a matter for the government, perhaps because neutral friendly countries are mediating from it, so it has not been resolutely rejected. However, the people of the country must not have a mentality of reliance. It must be known that yielding is a dead end, and resistance is a way out. I asked, what is the main business of the commander's trip to Beijing? He replied, there is nothing special to report. I asked, what is the will of all parties towards the war of resistance against Japan? He replied, the victory or defeat of the war of resistance against Japan is related to the survival of the nation. In my opinion, only by transforming private interests into public interests, uniting our spirits, and jointly going to the national crisis can we save the country. Now the whole country holds this purpose.</p>

<p>Also Reconstructing the Yunzaobang Bridge. It is learned that the Japanese military authorities intend to use the land behind Huafeng Yarn Factory, located at the western end of the Yunzaobang in Wusong, as a temporary station for the Japanese army's retreat due to the general agreement reached during the ceasefire conference to designate the area along the Yunzaobang Sitang River west of Wusong Town. A section of this location used to be an old tomb, which was destroyed by Japanese soldiers with explosives. A large quantity of construction materials has been shipped there and work will commence soon. It is also learned that the Yunzaobang bridge was repaired overnight and only stopped at dawn yesterday. Reportedly, the need to repair it arose because many heavy vehicles wanted to cross this bridge.</p>

<p>Notice to Citizens from the National Salvation Joint Association. The National Salvation Joint Association of Various Groups informs all citizens that traitors such as Hu Lifu and others in Zhabei are colluding with the enemy to organize local maintenance societies, poisoning the citizens. All patriotic citizens of the city should be aware that it has been reported that traitors Hu Lifu, Wang Du, Chang Yuqing, Cheng Xizhi, Yao Wu, Li Fei, etc., in Zhabei are colluding with the enemy to organize the so-called Zhabei Local Citizens' Maintenance Association, levying fees from the citizens. The municipal government has issued strict orders for their arrest. These traitors are not only violating the law, but are also enemies of our entire citizenry. They are truly rebellious officials and traitors who deserve to be condemned by everyone. They bring shame to their ancestors for generations and inflict eternal disgrace on their descendants. All citizens should not regard these traitors as ordinary criminals, but should listen to the military police's arrest with a bystander's attitude. Whether they know them or not, they should pay close attention and take appropriate and effective measures at any time to punish the wicked. It is hoped that all patriotic citizens will think of the future of their descendants. When they encounter the behavior of these traitors, they should act righteously and exterminate their relatives. Fathers should not think of their sons, brothers should not think of their brothers, wives should not think of their husbands, and immediately declare their crimes and abandon them to the public. The survival of the nation depends on this. Shanghai Groups National Salvation Joint Association.</p>

The Da Mei Evening News reports that notices have been posted in various places in Zhabei this morning (the 9th) stating that if former residents of Zhabei do not return home or resume business as usual, their property may be confiscated. This notice was issued by the self-proclaimed Zhabei Citizens' Maintenance Association and posted by coolies hired by the association at a daily wage of fifty cents. Currently, 25% of the small shops within the fourth district west of Gonghe Xin Road are open for business, but they close as early as one hour before sunset at the latest. The association has also increased the donation rate for goods and luggage entering and leaving the country from 1% to 3% based on value. Thirty people have been hired to guard the border entrances and exits, and those who pass through the area without wearing the association's fabric symbols must have their belongings checked and donations assessed. There are also ten female inspectors assisting Japanese soldiers in searching women entering the country near Maigen Road Bridge. The association now plans to conduct a census on Monday.

<p>Ms. Qian Jianqiu Reports on the Significance of the Women's Association to Comfort and Rescue the National Defense Soldiers' Concert. The concert was held the night before last. At that time, it suddenly rained lightly, but Chinese and Western guests still flocked to the event, showing the audience's deep sympathy. Boy Scouts maintained order inside the venue, while more than 20 Chinese and Western ladies provided diligent hospitality outside the venue. At the opening ceremony, Qian Jianqiu, PhD, was publicly elected by the presidium, including Li Zemin, MA, and Ms. Zhu Jianxia, to report on the significance of comforting and rescuing the 19th Route Army's loyalty and courage in resisting and sacrificing for the country. He also explained that music has a transformative effect, hoping that it would be transmitted to the ears of the Japanese warlords and awaken them from their aggressive dreams. The audience applauded loudly. Then, the Yueguang Music Society played a complete performance of "Autumn Moon in the Han Palace." Ms. Qiunaisiji and others continued to present their masterpieces, including unique dances such as Pixia Nafenya Ling and Wei Ji, which won the welcome of the entire venue.

<p>Silver and Money Industries Believe It Is Difficult. After the War, Various Industries Reduce or Exempt Interest on Accounts. The Rehabilitation Committee, jointly established by the Citizens' Union and other organizations, decided to send Hu Fengxiang to discuss with the silver and money industries. The result of the discussion was that the issue of reducing or exempting interest was discussed with Xu Jiqing and Lin Kanghou of the silver and money industries, but there was no solution. Because the business of the silver and money industries relies entirely on interest. If the interest on the accounts of various industries is reduced or exempted, but the interest on the accounts of various depositors is still not reduced, then how can the silver and money industries survive? Therefore, the silver and money industries believe that it is fundamentally difficult to reduce or exempt interest on accounts. This issue will have to wait until the Rehabilitation Committee meets again to be further studied.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Records of Condolences to the Family of Martyr Teng <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Martyrs Sacrifice Themselves for the Country, the Families Must Be Supported. At a previous regular meeting of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee, Chairman Zhu Qinglan reported that, as reported in the newspapers, Staff Officer Teng of the Wusong Fort sacrificed himself for the country. The martyr left behind an elderly mother, a widow, and an orphan, which is truly pitiful. It is proposed to entrust the backbone members of the committee to personally visit the martyr's family and send a letter to the commander of the fortress to raise funds for support and to comfort the heroic spirit. At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, Wu Shan personally went to Room 11, Huabei Apartment, to visit Madam Yang Peiyao, the wife of Teng. Seeing her holding the posthumous child who was less than two months old, she replied with tears that her late husband, Staff Officer Teng, whose name was Jiu Shou and whose alias was Qizhi, was from Dujiang County, Guizhou, was 33 years old and had served under Commander Deng Zhenquan of the Wusong Fortress for two years. At about 10 a.m. on February 4th, the Japanese warship bombed the Wusong Fort. A bullet hit his left arm. His personal guard asked him to retreat temporarily. The martyr angrily shouted, "We soldiers have the responsibility to protect the country and defend the people. Return to the artillery to kill the enemy quickly. Those who retreat will be beheaded!" Before he could finish speaking, he was unfortunately hit by another enemy bullet in his right armpit, blowing off his right hand. The shrapnel pierced his chest and abdomen. Although the fort was preserved, her husband died for the country. His body was wrapped in cotton by the artillery and buried. In mid-March, the Blue Cross Society of the Pushan Villa went to search for it and found his face as if he were still alive. Now it is planned to choose a date to bury him in Yong'an Cemetery. There is an 81-year-old mother, a 30-year-old widow Peiyao, and an 18-month-old son Yumin, who has just begun to walk. The posthumous son will be two months old soon. The furniture and clothes were all burned by the Japanese in the Song Residence, leaving nothing. The mother is a widow, the children are orphans, lonely and miserable. For support and education, I only hope that virtuous and benevolent people in society will provide assistance. We will be grateful in life and death. Wu advised her to imitate Mencius's mother, take good care of the orphan, and assured her that the government will definitely provide compensation, and society will certainly provide assistance to comfort the martyr's heroic spirit. In 20 years, when the orphan has completed his studies and established himself, the madam will enjoy boundless happiness.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Shanghai Times Labor Dispute Yesterday's News <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The labor union convened a general meeting of all workers, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau mediated, and the management did not arrive. The press labor union issued a message stating that the "Shanghai Times" authorities had a misunderstanding between labor and management due to the printing of the "Great Evening News." All the details of the dispute have been reported in this newspaper twice. The news obtained yesterday is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The Press Labor Union Convenes a General Meeting of All Workers Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, the union convened a general meeting of all workers who were forced by the "Shanghai Times." More than 100 people attended the meeting. The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, saying briefly that no matter what violence the management uses to destroy the unity of our labor union, the union will never succumb to it. I hope that all comrades will strictly observe order and wait patiently for a solution. We have long recognized that this is an overall problem, so no matter what despicable means they use to seduce or violent threats, the union will not give up until the final victory. Then, the negotiation group reported on the negotiation process in the past few days, saying briefly that regardless of whether the management is sincere, we will always proceed according to the policies of the special committee. We only hope that all comrades will work hard and be resolute, and the final victory will surely belong to us, etc. Then, the following requests were made: (1) I hope that the special committee will insist on our original conditions and never back down. (2) Urge the special committee to resolve the matter as soon as possible in the shortest possible time. The meeting adjourned at 6:00. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Mediated, but the Management Did Not Arrive Director Mai of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, fearing that the labor dispute at the newspaper had not been resolved for a long time and that the scope would expand, which would hinder social order, specially summoned the parties involved to the bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 9th) to mediate and issued notices in advance. Four representatives from the labor side attended on time, but the management of the newspaper refused to attend, so there was no way to mediate yesterday. The labor side immediately stated that the management should be responsible for the expansion of the storm thereafter.</p>
<p>The Labor Union Explains the Management's Acts of Sabotage A spokesman for the labor union said that after the incident at the newspaper, the management claimed that the workers were on strike. If the workers were on strike, the newspaper would inevitably be unable to publish, which would be in line with the facts. However, the newspaper has been able to publish as usual since the labor dispute occurred, which has been a week now, but the length has been reduced. As a result, the outside world does not understand the truth and there are many misunderstandings. It is not known that the management of the newspaper has been plotting to destroy the labor union organization for a long time. It is said that a number of workers from other places were hired in advance to practice day and night in a certain Western newspaper building in order to make preparations. On the one hand, they usually treat workers with weak wills with threats and inducements, thinking that they can be used temporarily, that is, the matter of limiting registration to three days is also one of these tricks. Therefore, the length of the newspaper has been increasing one after another in recent days, and the reason is here. The reason why the length was reduced before is also here. In short, no matter what despicable and vile means the management of the newspaper has used this time, the labor union will not recognize it for the time being, he said.</p>
<p>The Labor Union Solemnly Denies that the Dispute Has Been Resolved Yesterday (the 9th), the "Great Evening News" published an article saying that the "Shanghai Times" dispute had been resolved, saying, "After many mediations and reconciliations, labor and management were able to develop a spirit of mutual understanding and mutual success, and a satisfactory result has been achieved today." A spokesman for the Press Labor Union solemnly denied that the so-called workers who understand and succeed each other are indeed a very small number of workers with weak wills who have been induced and threatened. Moreover, the "Shanghai Times" still published an advertisement on the same day, "All workers of this newspaper are aware," inducing workers who refused to register, which shows that this news is entirely of a deceptive nature to confuse the public, he said.</p>
<p>Various Groups Have Sent People to Express Condolences In response to the unreasonable oppression of workers by the authorities of the "Shanghai Times," various groups are very concerned about this matter. More than a dozen people have been sent or sent letters to the association to express condolences in recent days. Yesterday, representatives from the Soy Sauce Industry Workers Union, Weng Ruifu, representatives from the Postal Workers Union, Huang Gongfu, and other labor unions all went to the association to express their condolences. Here is a copy of the letter of condolence from the Soy Sauce Industry Workers Union (above omitted). The news that the "Shanghai Times" used decisive means to expel workers and close the factory is shocking. This kind of action that disregards public reason reveals its intention to destroy the labor union and destroy the labor movement. If this is not contested, the disaster will be endless. Standing on the same worker's position, our association expresses its sincere sympathy and is willing to provide strong assistance (below omitted).</p>
<h3 id="e28">Declaration of the Postal Workers Union and the Postal Workers Union on the "Shanghai Times" Dispute <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Postal Workers Union and the Postal Workers Union issued a declaration yesterday, stating that all sectors of society are aware that our country is currently suffering from aggression by the violent Japanese and is suffering from floods. The national disaster is imminent. At this time, we should unite, love each other, worry and strive for self-improvement to save the country and to ensure social stability. We sincerely do not want to see internal disputes occur within our society at this time of national crisis, so as to disrupt the steps for external unity and to shame internal strife. However, recently, the unfortunate dispute of the "Shanghai Times" has occurred. Regardless of who is right or wrong, it is disturbing social peace and causing labor-management conflicts. This is not only regrettable, but also gives the enemy something to laugh at. Although various parties have mediated, one party has a firm will and delays in every possible way, while the other party has lost its freedom and is calling out loudly. After reading the declaration of the Shanghai Press Labor Union, we feel that the cause of this labor dispute is at least due to the improper measures taken by the management. According to the investigation, since the Shanghai Incident, the workers of the factory have not only worked hard on their original work, but have also added the work of the newspaper's extra edition. Although they receive very little pay, they are content with it. At this time of national crisis, it is truly commendable that workers can work so hard. However, on March 30, the management suddenly ordered the workers of the factory to print the "Great Evening News" separately without the consent of the labor union. Workers who do not have enough knowledge are naturally easily influenced. The labor union came out to question it, and the management used the force of the police based on various unconscious reports, which led to both sides going to extremes, which led to this sudden double. Therefore, we have to admit that the management should bear considerable responsibility for the creation of this incident. The newspaper is an organization that guides society and represents public opinion. The newspaper has always encouraged itself with this, and we also expect this from the newspaper. Now, it is disappointing that the newspaper cannot work together harmoniously with its own workers. Our associations hereby sincerely tell all sectors of society in a frank manner that the country is now facing foreign aggression and the whole country is in turmoil. Anyone who is alive should take the country as the premise and must not start meaningless disputes between labor and management at this time of national crisis and in the autumn of unemployment panic. If both parties can be open and honest and first restore the status quo before April 2, then all follow-up problems can be resolved forever through the most well-intentioned negotiations. Our associations do not want this labor dispute to be further expanded. If one party insists on going its own way, then our associations will spare no effort to help each other. Postal Workers Union, Postal Workers Union.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Guangdong Representatives Comfort Soldiers <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Since the 19th Route Army fought a bloody battle against Japan, all sectors of Guangdong Province have specially organized a National Salvation Fundraising Committee to raise funds to comfort the soldiers at the front lines of the anti-Japanese war. A few days ago, they also sent representatives Wu Zhimei, Lin Yichuan, and Huang Wenkuan to Shanghai with 20,000 yuan to transfer to the front lines to comfort the soldiers. Mr. Wu and others arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and immediately met with Zheng Baozhao, director of the two-way transportation office, and asked him to introduce them to Kunshan to meet the officers of the 19th Route Army. Zheng agreed to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Kunshan yesterday morning. It is reported that Mr. Wu and others said that more than one million yuan of anti-Japanese donations have been raised in Guangdong Province and will be remitted one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e30">600 Japanese Soldiers Landed at Zhanghuabang Yesterday <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday, a Japanese military transport ship arrived at the grain and rice stack wharf in Zhanghuabang, Wusong, carrying 600 army soldiers. After the ship docked at the wharf, the soldiers landed one after another carrying weapons and were loaded onto more than 20 trucks, which drove along Guanyintang Road towards Jiangwan. It is said that they were transferred to Nanxiang.</p>
<h3 id="e31">The Military Industry Road Occupied by the Japanese Army <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Can be said to be unobstructed. The "Great American Evening News" reported that the Japanese headquarters announced this morning (the 9th) that the Wusong Military Industry Road is now open. Pedestrians and vehicles who want to go to Wusong from this road no longer need to obtain a pass from the Japanese headquarters. Except for temporary emergencies, residents can usually go directly from the border of the concession to Wusong Town without carrying a pass. However, the western part of Jiangwan Town is still forbidden for people to go, and even those with ordinary passes are not allowed to enter. It is expected that the Japanese army engineering team is still arranging defensive works there.</p>

<p>Preparing for a big battle on June 16, the public's attitude is not enthusiastic. The World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, German Max Schmeling, who won this honor due to Jack Sharkey's foul, arrived in New York from Europe on April 8 and will begin training to fight Sharkey again on June 16. When Mr. Schmeling arrived, there was no grand and exaggerated welcome, because the public's attitude was not as enthusiastic as it used to be.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Letter from Various Groups in the French Concession Rent Reduction Committee to the French Consul General <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Rent Reduction Committee sent a letter to the French Consul General yesterday, stating, "Dear Sir, since the unfortunate incident between China and Japan occurred in Shanghai, residents have felt pain. The citizens of our French Concession have been greatly benefited because of your Excellency's assumption of office, your increased efforts to maintain the security of the concession, and your protection of citizens' peaceful life and work, which have achieved remarkable results. Therefore, the friendship between China and France and the goodwill of the people all rely on your Excellency's enthusiasm for promotion. However, this time, the residents of Shanghai have been affected by the Sino-Japanese war, resulting in commercial depression and economic difficulties. Therefore, the residents of the city have the claim of reducing or waiving rent, which is really a last resort, but it is also the only good way to rescue people's livelihood, maintain social order, and prosper commerce. However, the situation in our French Concession is different from that in neighboring areas. Regarding this matter, after following the situation of rent reduction in various parts of the city, we should carefully handle it, study it in detail, and discuss it publicly to ensure that both landlords and tenants can be treated fairly, so as to achieve a peaceful solution. According to the investigation, your Excellency's office also promulgated a prohibition on rent increases, etc., in October 1912, but those who spoke earnestly were ignored by those who listened, so it has been delayed for a long time. It is reasonable to request that the previous order be reiterated and that all malpractices, rent increases, and forced evictions be strictly prohibited. However, our association's rent reduction issue this time is only based on the fact that businesses in various industries and tenants in various neighborhoods automatically advocate and request landlords to be considerate and reduce or waive rent. Our association is in a position to review the situation and mediate in the middle. Regarding all taxes and fees, such as water and electricity, that residents should pay to the Municipal Council, they will not be reduced or waived in order to maintain each other and avoid misunderstandings. As for the members of our association, they are all good businessmen and people who uphold peaceful mediation and aim to settle things down. We should ask your Excellency to observe the situation and approve the request. We are deeply grateful. Sincerely, the French Consul General in Shanghai, Mei, the French Concession Rent Reduction Committee, the French Concession Business Federation, Nanyang Bridge, Caishi Road, Minguo Road, Aidoa Road, the Business Federation of Tangjiawan West District, New West District Twelve Roads, Xujiahui, etc., the French Concession Stack Industry Federation, etc., jointly signed, April 9."</p>

<h3 id="e35">Telephone Bureau Chief Wei Zengfu Takes Over <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Shouheng, the director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, has served for two years. Now, he has been transferred to the Ministry, and the Ministry has appointed Wei Zengfu as the new director. Mr. Wei is from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. He graduated from the former Nanyang University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Guangzhou Automatic Telephone Project. Two years ago, he was hired by the Shanghai China Foreign German Telephone Company to come to Shanghai to preside over the outside line project of automatic telephones. He has considerable experience and knowledge in telephone engineering. According to Mr. Wei, he will actively find ways to eliminate the difficulties in communication between the Chinese and rental sectors. In addition, the Chinese chief engineer of the bureau has resigned due to personal reasons and has also been approved by the Ministry. Wang Junke has been appointed as his successor. Wang is also a China Foreign German Telephone Engineer and has taken office a few days ago.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Only Rice Boats Are Allowed to Stop on the South Bank Between the Old and New Garbage Bridges <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Because the North Rice Market is located in Zunde Lane, the Shanghai Rice Price Parity Association sent a letter to the River and Sea Customs Ship Management Office yesterday, stating, "Dear Sir, according to the letter from the Beishi Office of the Shanghai Bean Rice Industry Association on the 8th of this month, our colleagues have been operating in Zhabei for many years. Since the 128 War, Zhabei City has been suspended. Our colleagues have moved into the concession one after another. Although we have tried our best to maintain the future of people's food, we have no place to gather, so rice boats from the interior cannot come, and the food supply in this port is worrying. Considering this, our office convened a meeting of colleagues on the 29th of last month and decided to set up a market in Zunde Lane on the south side of the old garbage bridge in the Public Concession to facilitate centralized management to dredge the source and regulate food. The docking point for rice boats is designated on the south bank between the new and old garbage bridges, and the Municipal Council has sent police to protect it day and night. It has started business today, but other idle boats are mixed in between, so rice boats cannot safely dock. Therefore, we specifically ask your association to forward a letter to the Water Patrol Team to order the police to quickly remove the various empty boats from the Duan to facilitate the docking of rice boats and emphasize the importance of food. This will be of public interest, etc." The letter was approved, stating that since the market was moved into the concession, the request to order other empty boats in the middle of the south bank between the new and old garbage bridges to move away to facilitate the safe docking of rice boats arriving in Shanghai without obstruction is justified. Accordingly, this letter is sent to you, hoping that you will consider the food supply of the people and order the Water Patrol Team to move the empty boats in the Duan to facilitate the docking of rice boats without any obstruction.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Dayang Bridge Repaired and Open to Traffic <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Dayang Bridge on Houmalu in Caojiadu, western Shanghai, is the main road for traffic to and from the north bank in that area. However, since the 128 War, the Italian army has been stationed at various key points on the Suzhou River, so the bridge was demolished and Italian soldiers were stationed day and night on the south side of the bridge. Iron wire nets, sandbags, and other obstacles were erected, so that the residents on the north and south banks were obstructed from traveling and felt greatly distressed. The members of the Third Branch of the Town Citizens Union raised funds from various merchants to purchase two barges, which were used to provide shuttle services next to the bridge, without charging any fees, so the public was very satisfied. Now that the ceasefire conference is in progress and the situation is gradually becoming peaceful, the merchants have all opened for business. A few days ago, workers were hired to repair the bridge, and it was officially opened to traffic yesterday morning, restoring its original state. The volunteer ferry has also been canceled.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Yangtze River Route Increases Freight Rates <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Shallow Water Fee Reduced by 30% On the Yangtze River route, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other areas, the water level decreases every winter, and there are slight procedures for transporting goods to those places. Therefore, from November 1 of last year, various shipping companies increased the shallow water fee by 30% and added 15% to the freight rate. This spring, the river water has risen slightly. China Merchants, Jardine, Taikoo, Ning Shao, Sanbei, and other companies decided the day before yesterday to cancel the shallow water by 30% from the 16th of this month and agreed to increase the freight rates from Shanghai to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places by 30% at the same time. This has been notified to various customs brokers yesterday to inform the guests.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Repercussions of Registration Fee Collection <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Barge Association telegraphs the Central Government requesting the cancellation of the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Central Government stating: Respectfully to Your Excellency the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Luoyang, Ministry of Communications. Our association's barges are exclusively engaged in transporting coal and stone within Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. They have been measured and registered by the Shanghai Municipal Government Public Works Bureau and pay monthly boat taxes. Recently, member firms have reported that the Navigation Bureau has established four sub-stations in the corner of Suzhou, forcibly registering civilian ships and charging a large registration fee of fifteen yuan per vessel. Currently, during this time of national crisis and unrecovered vitality, how can impoverished boat owners bear this heavy burden? The establishment of the Navigation Bureau is intended to verify the load and tonnage of Chinese and foreign steamships and handle registration matters. Since inland river civilian ships have already been measured and registered by the local competent authorities, there is no need for the Bureau to re-examine them, merely collecting a disguised tax under the name of registration, which is illegal and harmful to the people. We respectfully request that Your Excellency's Yuan and Ministry consider the merchants' difficulties and swiftly order the Navigation Bureau to abolish all sub-stations to maintain the people's livelihoods. This telegram is delivered with the utmost urgency awaiting your orders. Respectfully, Ruan Xuedao, Chairman of the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association, Standing Committee Members Tang Jinshu, Yuan Genquan, Cao Yuyu, Fan Deyu, respectfully kowtow.</p>

<p>Propaganda and the Holding of Meetings on the Significance of Establishing Defense Corps; Division of Category A Households. Regarding the formal organization of the Shanghai County Defense Corps, since the establishment of the Defense Committee on the first of this month, the committee has drafted measures for re-dividing Category A households and compiling household registers. The county has issued orders to all district chiefs, who also serve as district leaders of the Defense Corps, to follow the measures. Dates have been set for convening meetings in each district to divide Category A households. It is now known that the Fifth and Sixth Districts will hold meetings on the 11th, the Third and Fourth Districts on the 12th, and the First and Second Districts on the 13th. At that time, Xu Yi, the committee's office director and head of the training section, Chuan Dianying, head of the general affairs section, Ge Xiusheng, a staff member of the training section, and others appointed by the county will attend and provide guidance. They will also bring a large number of slogans and inform township and village chiefs to go to the countryside to carry out propaganda, so that the public understands the significance of establishing the Defense Corps, which will benefit its progress.</p>
<h3 id="e41">English Missionary Reports on Disaster Conditions in Various Provinces <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Johnsen, the director of the English Candeburg Church, returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 8th) after inspecting the flood disaster and relief situation in Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan provinces. He stated that this arduous work is proceeding excellently. After touring Anhui, he deeply admired the organized and economical work of the National Flood Relief Commission. After visiting the two lakes, his admiration increased even further. Currently, the disaster situation in northern Anhui is extremely serious, which can be called a true famine. People are using tree bark, aquatic plants, mulberry leaves, etc. to stave off hunger, and cases of starvation and suicide are frequently heard of. The difficulty of transportation in this area is the biggest reason, but the performance of the Relief Commission is very good. Later, in Wuhan, Mr. Andrews of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee accompanied him on an inspection and described the relief projects carried out by the Committee in Shaanxi. He will personally attend the canal opening ceremony of the Weihe River in northern Wei, and also view the new automobile road built by the Gansu work-relief project.

<h3 id="e43">Anti-Drug Association Opposes Leftover Sentiment on Fujian Province's Opium Public Sales <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Since Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of Fujian Province, colluded with the garrison to implement opium public sales, the China National Anti-Drug Association has spared no effort in opposing it, repeatedly requesting the Central Government to send personnel to investigate and issuing declarations to inform the whole country. Previous reports have recorded this. It is now learned that although the Fujian Provincial Government issued an order to abolish opium public sales a few days ago, the Association fears that this move is only a temporary deception and not a thorough cancellation. Yesterday, they telegraphed various anti-drug organizations in Fujian to pay close attention to prevent the resurgence of the dead embers. The telegram reads as follows: "Fujian Provincial Government Anti-Smoking Committee, Fujian Detoxification Association, Xiamen Anti-Drug Association, and all anti-drug organizations, Fang Shengtao, Chen Guohui, He Xianzhu, Zhang Zhen, and others are blinded by profit and obsessed with public sales, illegally establishing illegal inspection offices, issuing opium stamps, openly collecting taxes, indulging in the opium scourge to disorder Fujian and cruelly abuse the people, their crime surpasses everything. Although your associations and the public have worked hard to oppose it, the provincial government was forced to temporarily announce its abolition. However, opium thugs and local merchants are reportedly still secretly active, advocating public sales, and the authorities still harbor desires, constantly watching for opportunities to move. The public sales policy may be revived at any time. We request that your association pay close attention and do not relax at all, to prevent sudden and unprepared actions and disguised moves. This association will exert its meager strength and vows to be a backing. Responsibility lies in life and death. We hope you will take note and handle it accordingly. China National Anti-Drug Association, respectfully kowtows, good seal."</p>
<h3 id="e44">Johnsen on the Achievements of Anhui Province and Wuhan Work Relief <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Johnsen, the deputy chaplain of the English Candeburg Church, is highly regarded. He came to China from England to inspect the disaster situation. In February, he went to the disaster area of Anhui Province to inspect. In late March, he transferred to Wuhan. Recently, he returned east on the same ship as the League of Nations Investigation Team. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He stated that the work relief in Anhui Province and Wuhan is progressing very well, everywhere reflecting the meticulous organization and proper management of the National Government's Flood Relief Work. Although work relief has been implemented in Anhui Province, cases of starvation or suicide among disaster victims are still heard of from time to time. The inconvenience of transportation in this area makes it difficult to transport relief wheat. Recently, the National Government Disaster Relief Association adopted the method of exchanging wheat and selling wheat, which has proven effective. The Wuhan work relief has a very good impact on the security of the area, because the disaster victims have relief wheat to maintain their livelihoods and are not easily incited by Communist and reactionary elements. Mr. Johnsen has telegraphed the results of this inspection to people in his country, widely publicizing it, and deeply hopes that all sectors will actively contribute to complete China's relief work. He is scheduled to leave for northern Anhui on the 11th to inspect and participate in the opening ceremony of the newly built northern Anhui Canal.</p>
<h3 id="e45">A Heinous Crime Amidst National Crisis: A Woman With Severed Feet Swindles <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Claiming to join the frontline in the Dachang battle, but lacking both feet, unexpectedly swindling four yuan, and smoking opium in the hotel. Mr. Zhang Yueru, an executive of the China Philanthropic and Child Welfare Association, was passing near Zhao Jiaqiao on Hart Road, Avenue Haig, at around 8 PM last night, when he suddenly saw a young woman sitting by the roadside with both feet severed. The woman appeared to be about thirty years old, fashionably dressed, speaking with a northern accent, and crying on the ground. Passersby gathered around to watch. An inquisitive person asked about her background. The woman cried and sobbed, claiming to be from Chongqing, Sichuan, and had studied at Yenching University in Peiping. During this Japanese invasion of Shanghai, she and several comrades resolutely joined the volunteer army and rushed to Shanghai to kill the enemy. Unexpectedly, in the Dachang battle, she sacrificed both feet, and several comrades who came with her died. The remaining two also had broken legs and arms. The three of them are now stranded in a hotel, and their funds have run out. They will starve to death. Today, she came here to visit a classmate surnamed Zhang to ask for a loan, but the classmate had moved to another place and could not be found. Therefore, she was wandering on the roadside, feeling unbearable sorrow. While speaking, tears fell like rain, which made the listeners feel compassion. Mr. Zhang asked where her hotel was. She said it was Anle Hotel in Taiyuanfang, Caishi Street, in the French Concession, room number 15. Mr. Zhang felt that her words were contradictory, so he invited her to go to the hotel to investigate and promised to help. However, the woman claimed that it was getting late and that she was a woman and felt it was inconvenient. She said he could do her a favor tomorrow. At that time, Wu Zong, a resident of 1215 Hetaifang, gave her four yuan and asked her to take it. The woman pretended to be shy but accepted it impolitely and put it in her arms, hiring a car and leaving proudly. Mr. Zhang became suspicious, so at around 10 PM, he went to Anle Hotel to inquire. The hotel's tea waiter said that there was no woman with severed feet staying in the hotel. Mr. Zhang left and went to the neighboring Tongle Hotel to ask the tea waiters. Unexpectedly, there was indeed a woman with severed feet staying in room number seven, living there for several months, counting the time even before the January 28th incident. She had been without feet since she arrived, living quite luxuriously and having savings in the bank. Mr. Zhang did not wait for him to finish speaking and rushed to push open the door. Unexpectedly, when the door opened, he saw the woman with severed feet lying on the bed, frequently playing a short flute, and the smell of opium enveloping the entire room. The woman was panicked when she suddenly saw Mr. Zhang. The short flute was in her hand, making it difficult to blow it or throw it away. At this point, Mr. Zhang did not bother to ask more questions and left angrily. He reported it to the reporter that night. Alas, in this ten-mile foreign concession, everything is strange. The woman with severed feet can use the national crisis and her own shortcomings to create a new trick. It can be said that she is cunning.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Conspiring to Kill His Wife <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The great number of life and death... the wife was rescued. The three accomplices... were all arrested. Ge Chengrong, a Yangzhou native who was a foreman on the Longda ship at the Datong Wharf, is now fifty years old. On March 2nd at 8 AM, he allegedly conspired with his fellow villager Dong Shaoqing and others to murder his wife, Ge Chenshi (49 years old, Yangzhou native). The other day, Chinese detectives Lang Jintang and Bao Qiu Sijiu, and Western detective Smith of the Lao Zha Police Station arrested Ge and Dong. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Zhou Hanting presided over the interrogation. First, the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that the Public Works Bureau is prosecuting according to Article 282, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for murder. If the written interrogation reveals premeditated behavior by the defendant, the legal article will be changed. Lawyer Ru also detailed the circumstances of the case, stating that the victim, Ge Chenshi, and the defendant, Ge Chengrong, are formally married. Five years ago, they developed animosity, and Ge took Zhao as a concubine. Because she was not tolerated by the legal wife, Ge and Zhao lived together at 43 Sanyuanfang, Yangshupu. Ge was previously a foreman on the Longda ship, and then transferred the foreman position to Ge Chenshi to continue. Ge became unemployed. For five years, life has been difficult. He wanted to regain the foreman position, but there was no suitable opportunity. Recently, he learned that Ge Chenshi was having an affair with Liu Ruyuan, which made him feel burning anger. He wanted to find a way to slander her. At that time, Dong Shaoqing, a tailor from the same village who could not operate due to the war, came to Shanghai to seek employment from Ge. Ge discussed this matter with Dong, saying that if he could help him regain the foreman position, he could help him there in the future. So, on February 28th of this year, at 2 PM, at the Tongchun Garden Teahouse on Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession, Ge invited Lao Cui (who is at large) and Wu Xiaodaizi, and Dong, four people to discuss how to put Ge Chenshi to death. Since she was a woman and unable to resist, they decided to use violence. On March 2nd, at 6 AM, the four of them went to Ge Chenshi's home at 57 Hongruili, Xinzha Road, and divided the work. Lao Cui waited downstairs. Ge, Dong, and Wu went upstairs and entered her bedroom in the back building. But since it was early in the morning, she was still asleep and not awake. Since the maid Zhang Shenshi was also in the room, fearing that it would hinder their work, they ordered Shenshi to go out to brew water and asked her to buy pan-fried buns from the shop to prolong the time, making it easier to work. Ge opened and closed the door and hid behind the door. Dong went forward and grabbed Ge Chenshi's throat with his hand, trying to strangle her to death. At first, he saw her feet still moving and tried his best to strangle her. Later, seeing that she was still, he thought she was dead and hurriedly fled. At this time, the maid Zhang Shenshi also returned, witnessing the situation in shock, and tried to save Ge Chenshi, who was able to wake up. She immediately reported to the Xinzha Police Station, saying that she had been murdered by her husband and three or two people whose names she did not know. The police investigation revealed that the unknown people were Dong Shaoqing and Wu Xiaodaizi. As for Lao Cui, the plaintiff did not know because he was downstairs. Until yesterday morning, the plaintiff met Dong on Laohe Road and reported him to the police, who arrested him and revealed the instigator, Ge Chengrong, who was arrested at 3 Sanyuanfang Road, Yangshupu. However, Ge denied everything in the police station, and Dong also claimed that Wu Xiaodaizi did it. However, the victim, Ge Chenshi, identified Dong Shaoqing as the one who did it in the police station. Her confession was recorded and presented to the court for investigation. Furthermore, Chinese detective Lang Jintang testified that when he went to Ge's house to arrest him yesterday, Ge Chengrong was hiding under the firewood pile under the bed and was dragged out by him. The victim Ge Chenshi also stated that Ge Chengrong is my husband. Five years ago, we had a lawsuit because he took a concubine and signed an agreement to separate and have nothing to do with each other. The so-called Liu Ruyuan is not my lover, but an accountant who has returned to his hometown of Yangzhou. On March 2nd, at 7 AM, Ge, Dong, and others arrived one after another. When I asked them what they were doing, they prevaricated each other. After a while, Ge closed the door and Dong grabbed my throat with both hands. Another person knelt on my chest and pressed down on my legs. At that time, I shouted for help. Dong said, "Today I will take your life." After a while, I felt confused. I seemed to hear Dong say, "She's dead, she's dead." He also said, "We should have come a long time ago, but you have lived a few days longer." Later, the maid came and rescued me, reported to the police station, and sent me to the hospital, where I stayed for four or five days before returning home to recuperate. Furthermore, the witness, maid Zhang Shenshi, testified to everything. When questioned, the defendant Dong Shaoqing confessed that he was instructed by Ge to go with him, but he was also downstairs, and Wu Xiaodaizi did it. When questioned, Ge Chengrong denied the allegations, saying that the facts were false accusations. Judge Zhou verified the confessions and ordered the case to be adjourned for seven days for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>

Yesterday morning, Tan attempted suicide by throwing himself into the river, but was rescued by Xue Silin and sent to the Water Patrol Police Station for transfer to the Local Court for placement.</p>

<p>Estimated at 300 Pounds. Chen Wenbing, a dock porter, was hired by the Liyuan Shipping Bureau at 35 Huangpu Bund, French Concession, on the evening of the 25th of last month, to carry two sacks of poisonous red pills, weighing 47 pounds, intending to send them to the Jiangtian Steamboat. He was intercepted by Chinese patrolman number 236 of the French Police and taken into custody. That night, detective supervisor Chen Sanlin and detectives of the day shift searched four bags of the same poisonous pills in the kitchen shed of the Shipping Bureau, weighing 250 pounds.

<h3 id="e56">Thugs Extort Money Outside the Benevolent Hall <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to 40 Days of Detention. The Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall on Ningbo Road in the French Concession specializes in collecting and burying exposed or abandoned coffins and corpses found on the streets. Also, if the families of deceased children in the city have no place to bury them after encoffining them, they can be sent to the hall for burial. Unexpectedly, thugs often wait outside the back door of the hall, and when they see someone carrying a small coffin there, they extort money from them, treating it as a source of profit. Although the hall has repeatedly reported this to the police station, which has sent detectives to arrest and detain them, the thugs do not repent and continue to extort money as before. On the 28th of last month, at noon, someone carried a small coffin to the hall, asking for it to be buried. Local thugs Wang Changsheng and three accomplices extorted five yuan from the people carrying the coffin, claiming that they had to pay at least 2.4 yuan, calling it "toll money." They were threatening and prevented the hall staff from receiving the coffin. The hall staff believed that such unlawful behavior was hindering charitable acts, so they telephoned the Great Clock Police Station, which sent detectives Gu Mingzhou and Lu Jinnan to arrest them. The accomplices had fled, but they arrested Li and took him to the Second Special District Court, prosecuting him under the charges of intimidation and fraud, and detaining him pending trial. Judge Li Changnian examined the case. The defendant's confession was cunning, but the witness, a hall staff member, testified. The court found the case clear and declared the trial closed. Yesterday at 2 PM, Judge Li presided over the Criminal Division and ordered Wang Changsheng to be brought to court, sentencing the defendant to 40 days of detention for the crime of intimidation and extortion. The number of days of detention before the sentence was finalized was deducted at a rate of one day of detention for every two days.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Upon reviewing your newspaper's April 3rd news column, we were very surprised to see the item about the dismissal of Detective Squad Foreman Qi Haitian. According to Public Security Bureau Instruction General Document No. 86, Detective Squad Leader Lu Ying was ordered to comply. An investigation revealed that Squad Foreman Qi Haitian had neglected his duties and misled his superiors. It was verified and confirmed that he should be immediately dismissed as a disciplinary measure. This order was to be obeyed. (Signed) Wen Yingxing, Bureau Chief. The above is the original text of the instruction. Your newspaper's statement that he was "awaiting punishment" is slightly inaccurate. Please correct it to avoid misunderstandings.

<p>(Beiping) Gu Weijun told reporters that the representatives believe that the reports received in the South were mostly theoretical, while the reports received in the North were based on facts. The Northeast Incident focuses on facts, so they are extremely satisfied with the reports from the North. However, because there have been too many receptions in the past two months, and they will soon be going to the Northeast to prepare a report and study materials, they will reduce socializing. I met with Foreign Minister Luo in Beijing and have not received any reports of being denied entry. I am part of the League of Nations delegation and will of course go to the Northeast. The representatives have a very good impression of this trip. (Special Dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gu Weijun said tonight that the investigation team highly praised the facilities of the Beining Railway. They will stay in Beiping for seven days, or ten days in total, and hope that all sectors will reduce banquets to give them time to collect materials. Lord Lytton and others are tired from the journey and plan to rest for a day or two and meet with various circles separately. They will still leave for the Northeast via the Beining Railway. A simple report will be prepared for the League of Nations General Assembly on May 1st. (Special Dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Meeting with Northeast Elders in Tianjin <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The League of Nations investigation team's special train arrived in Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Li Shaofen, the daughter of former President Li Yuanhong, representing the people of the city, was the first to board the train and present a bouquet of flowers to express her welcome. Next, Wang Shuchang and Zhou Longguang of the provincial and municipal authorities, and Wang Boling, Ka Baimei, and Duan Maolan representing the people, boarded the train to welcome them. The representatives of various countries changed to cars and went to the Xihu Hotel to rest. All the streets, both Chinese and Japanese, were cleared of people. At 10:00 AM, the investigation team first met with the Northeast elders Wu, Bao, and San Yuan, and talked for an hour and a half. They attached great importance to what the three elders said about the situation in the Northeast. Next, they met with consuls and military attachés from various countries, and then with representatives of the people, Zhang Boling, Ka Baimei, Zhang Pintiming, Wang Wendian, Shi Zizhou, and Li Shaofen. After accepting written opinions, they inquired in detail about Puyi's forced departure and the Tianjin Incident. At 12:30 PM, unable to meet with reporters, they went to the provincial government for a public banquet. Wang Shuchang gave a welcoming speech, saying that the League of Nations maintained world peace and sent an investigation team to travel across the oceans to investigate the Sino-Japanese dispute, which would surely be resolved fairly. He raised his glass and wished everyone good health and lasting world peace. Lytton replied, saying that his team was commissioned by the League of Nations to investigate the Sino-Japanese dispute. They had traveled to various places and obtained a lot of material. They would soon arrive at their final destination in the Northeast, and the League of Nations would have a fair resolution in the future. After the banquet at 2:30 PM, photos were taken. At 3:20 PM, they left Tianjin. Originally scheduled to board the train at the East Station, they changed to board the train at the main station to go to Beiping because the public groups passed through the Italian Concession, which might be inconvenient. The purpose of the investigation team's visit to Beiping was to contact Zhang Xueliang, the former governor of the Northeast, and inquire about the Northeast Incident. Because they were busy, all public banquets were declined, only agreeing to attend Zhang's banquet on the evening of the 10th. They plan to stay in Beiping for a week and take a special train out of the pass on the 18th to investigate in Shenyang, and then divide into groups to investigate in Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places. After the investigation is completed, they will go to Nara to compile a report. However, who is responsible for protecting the trains traveling from Beiping to Shenyang outside the pass is still under negotiation. (Special Dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The League of Nations investigation team arrived in Tianjin this morning from Pukou. The station was heavily guarded, and no one was allowed to enter without a pass.

<p>(Jinan) Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, gave a welcoming speech on behalf of Han [Fuqu] to the League of Nations investigation team, saying that the provincial government and the people were very honored to gather with the gentlemen of the League of Nations investigation team. Chairman Han was unable to come due to illness, and he was very sorry, so he ordered me to say a few words on his behalf. The gentlemen have come from afar and have visited Shanghai, and I believe that all the circumstances are clear. When passing through Beijing, you met with the central government, and I believe the gentlemen are also clear about the central government's hopes. Today, the gentlemen come to Shandong, which has been a land of peace and justice for thousands of years in China. Confucius was born in this land. His lifelong teachings emphasized loyalty, filial piety, trustworthiness, righteousness, love, and peace. Therefore, the people of Shandong most believe in benevolence, concession, and peace. Only benevolence, concession, and peace can eliminate those who are not peaceful and concessionary. The reason why the world can be peaceful lies in the point of peace and concession. The gentlemen of your team are envoys of peace and are responsible for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Chinese people deeply believe that the gentlemen can resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute without a doubt. I welcome you on behalf of Chairman Han and wish you a smooth and complete success in the future. At this point, he raised his glass in salute, and Li Zhifan, Director of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, translated. Lytton listened, looked up at the ceiling, and pondered deeply. Then, amidst applause, he gave a reply, which was still translated by Li, saying that he was very honored to gather with everyone today, but he was very sad to hear that Chairman Han was ill, and asked him to convey this message. Just now, Director Zhang spoke on behalf of Chairman Han, saying that the people of Shandong do not hope that our team will show great compassion, but hope that we will handle the matter impartially. Our team visited various tragic situations in Shanghai, which need not be detailed. When we make a report to the League of Nations in the future, it will not be to report the tragic sights we have seen, but to report the atmosphere of peace everywhere. When our team gathered in New York, many Americans had unlimited hopes for our team. In Japan and China, there are many welcomers everywhere, and there is an atmosphere of seeking peace everywhere, unlike those who have hatred. Our team represents 54 countries and does not want any two countries to have war. Seeing that everyone hopes for peace, we hope to use the peaceful psychology of the majority to restrain those who are not peaceful. At this point, he raised his glass in response. Regarding the questions raised by the Jinan press, 1) What is your opinion on the Shanghai ceasefire conference? Lytton said that it has been satisfactorily answered. I see that everyone hopes for peace, which will surely help the permanent peace between China and Japan. 2) How has the investigation of the war zones in Shanghai and your understanding of China been? Lytton said that Shandong is the hometown of Confucius. Thousands of years before the League of Nations was established, Confucius's teachings were already very beneficial to the world. Now, we should study and maintain world peace based on Confucius's teachings. (Special Dispatch from the 9th)</p>

Opposing the Chinese representatives is opposing the team. After arriving in Beiping, a suitable method will be decided. (Central News Agency Telegram from the 9th)</p>

<p>A Fierce Debate Expected on the Shanghai Case Reuters Geneva, 9th The arrangements have now been made here for a very important discussion next week, consisting of four matters: the stalemate in the Far East and the Danube, the Disarmament Conference, and international labor affairs. Delegations will arrive here successively at the end of this week. British Foreign Secretary Simon is scheduled to arrive here by plane tomorrow. It is expected that when the Special Committee of 19 nations elected by the League of Nations General Assembly reconvenes to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute, there will be another fierce debate, because China has now expressed dissatisfaction with the slow progress of the Shanghai negotiations. The new plan proposed by Japan makes the withdrawal of Japanese troops conditional on guarantees of the safety of the lives, property, and legitimate businesses of Japanese residents in Shanghai, which League of Nations officials regard as vague and likely to lead to endless prevarication. It is expected that when the Special Committee meets, the Chinese delegation will do its utmost to ask the League of Nations to exert moral pressure on Japan, ordering it to abandon this plan and determine a date for the withdrawal of troops.</p>

<p>Reuters New York, 8th US Secretary of State Stimson and former Secretary of State Kellogg, the initiator of the Non-Aggression Pact, set off for Europe today. Stimson will temporarily serve as the US Chief Delegate to the Geneva Disarmament Conference. After boarding the ship, when asked whether the US would be unwilling to reduce its military spending while Japanese troops had not withdrawn from Northeast China, Stimson replied that this statement was not true and that he hoped the Sino-Japanese dispute could be resolved without causing war in the Far East. Kellogg also went to Geneva to attend the League of Nations conference.</p>
<p>National News New York, 8th According to Stimson, there are several proposals in Geneva that have a good chance of reaching an agreement, and these proposals should tend to reduce the chances of war. It is heard that Stimson will first go to Geneva, and then visit London and other European capitals. Although the purpose of this trip is to promote disarmament, it is said that Stimson really wants to talk to European politicians about Far Eastern policy, especially regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>Havas Washington, 8th After Stimson goes to Europe, he will meet with diplomatic authorities from various countries. US political figures have indicated that Stimson will get those countries with interests in the Far East to reach an understanding on the economic side. Stimson will also find out what methods European countries will take if Japan's ambitions expand in China to ensure the Kellogg-Briand Pact and what attitudes European countries intend to adopt towards the future status of the puppet state of Manchuria and the current situation in Shanghai, which Stimson also wants to understand.</p>

<p>Italian and German Newspapers Voice Criticism</p>
<p>National News Agency Rome, 8th The failure of the London Four-Power Conference does not surprise the political circles here, because based on the resolute attitude of France, it was expected that it would be difficult to have results. The newspapers have not yet commented, but the editorials of the newspapers in recent days have made it clear that France is responsible for the failure of the conference, because France wants to use its financial resources to consolidate its authority to control southeastern Europe. Italy will never tolerate this plan. The Italian Daily News declared this morning that Italy advocates preserving the legitimate interests of all countries, and Italy has no preconceived notions about this matter, but will never allow anyone to take advantage of the current situation of the Danube countries to achieve their political goals.</p>
<p>National News Agency Berlin, 8th The German side regards this London conference as a touchstone for the Lausanne reparations conference and other international conferences this summer. Now that the result is like this, the future of other conferences is also predictable. Most of the newspapers criticized France for wanting to take advantage of the plight of the Danube states to realize its political ambitions, plunging the conference into a complete deadlock, believing that France is still playing its old trick of whipping Europe, and will drive Europe to risk and jointly take away its whip before it is over. Unless that time comes, no matter what other countries say or do, there will never be peace in Europe.</p>
<p>Reuters London, 8th Although the Danube Conference has broken down, before French Finance Minister Flandin left England today, he told a Reuters reporter that he was certain that action would be taken soon, because the affected countries were aware of the seriousness of the situation. Now is not the time to argue over procedural details and harbor prejudices. Countries other than Britain and France have not fully realized the danger of the future, but if appropriate measures are not taken immediately, there will be a total collapse in Central and Southeastern Europe. The League of Nations Administrative Council will discuss in Geneva the report of the League of Nations Financial Committee on the situation of Austria, Budapest, and Hungary. The Austrian Prime Minister was scheduled to set off for Geneva today, but due to the breakdown of the London Four-Power Conference, his departure has been postponed.</p>

The election campaigns of various factions will end tonight, so the number of speakers today is unprecedented in Berlin.</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 9th Although the public expects General Hindenburg to be elected in this presidential election, the competition is still going on the eve of the election. This week, supporters of Hindenburg have held no less than 60,000 meetings, and today they will make the final publicity campaign. National Socialist Party leader Hitler flew across the country, attacking the government everywhere. Supporters of Hindenburg portrayed Hitler as a hangman. Members of the National Socialist Party were very angry, but as the authorities threatened to suppress the unrest with an iron fist, it seemed unlikely that serious disturbances would occur during the election. Both parties are working hard to mobilize female voters. The manifesto of the National Socialists stated that the party intended to support family life, while its opponents stated that the duty of National Socialist housewives was to beautify themselves and practice the biological work assigned by the Creator. The sharp contrast made the onlookers dizzy. Prime Minister Bruning will make the final campaign speech on the radio tonight, intending to implore the country to vote for Hindenburg, the veteran of war and peace. There are now speculations that the deposed crown prince intends to vote for Hitler or that there will be a reaction, but it is generally believed that this move will hurt Hitler and have no benefit, because the public believes that the Republicans will never support the old royal family.</p>

<p>Britain Should Cooperate with the United States to Maintain Peace in the Pacific Tokyo Asahi Shimbun carried a dispatch from its London correspondent, saying that the well-known commentator Wickham Steed has published an essay on British policy in the Pacific, detailing Britain's position of pacifism supported by the League of Nations. The British government should cooperate with the United States to safeguard the international peace treaty, and to maintain peace in the Pacific and seek the security of the British Empire, it has no choice but to cooperate with the United States. The first half of his essay observes Japan, saying that based on the impression of reactionary Japanese people that Steed obtained in the United States in 1921, it is a big question whether Japanese diplomats and politicians can determine Japan's policy or not. Recalling the World War, at the Washington Preparatory Conference, Prime Minister George and Foreign Minister Kato both argued that the United Kingdom should adopt a detached position on the survival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance due to the US-Japan dispute. Because the interests of the United Kingdom are contrary to those of Japan, even if the US and Japan go to war, the United Kingdom cannot participate, but part of the British Empire will inevitably be involved in the vortex, because Japan's provocative policy is that all English-speaking people are hostile to Japan. Judging from the secret opinion submitted to the naval authorities in 1921, Japan at that time had a superior naval power and was likely to induce war. At that time, the naval authorities of Britain and the United States both believed that Japan would expel the US Navy from the Pacific and occupy Honolulu and the Philippines within a few months. On the one hand, Japan will establish political and economic activities and labor in China and become the leader of the Far East. This is the only purpose that the Japanese military has always cherished. If this ambition of Japan extends to the entire Far East and Asia, wouldn't it be contrary to the interests of the United Kingdom? At that time, the United Kingdom itself cannot stand in a position of isolated closure. In terms of the meaning of the nation and race, for example, when a crisis is caused by the immigration problem, it is easier for the Japanese military to control German policy than the German military in 1914. This is Japan's high-profile Pan-Asianism and its efforts to expand its power. However, whether the policy it holds can be realized is also a question. If an incident occurs between the US and Japan one day, even if the British government wants to maintain neutrality, British Columbia will probably rise up against Japan. From this point of view, the United Kingdom's policy at the Washington Conference was quite concerned about the US-Japan dispute and urgently sought to resolve the Pacific problem. Therefore, at present, there is no other way than to unite the United States to maintain peace.</p>

At the same time, it will inevitably cause new problems, because in the past thirty years, the United States has not been coerced by Japan, and now there is a major crisis coming, because if the natural resources such as coal and iron produced in Manchuria are seized by Japan, Japan will no longer feel financial and economic difficulties, and the United States will therefore be greatly coerced.</p>

Currently, they are in contact with various nurses' associations in the city, such as the Tokyo Nurses' Association in Ushigome Ward Kaguracho, the Mitoku Nurses' Association in Yotsuya Ward Kojimachi, the Sato Nurses' Association in Jinbocho, the Fukagawa Hospital, and the Eguchi Nurses' Association in Kamio-Ogu, Ogu-machi. Female Communist Party members have been found to have connections. Recently, police stations in various districts have separately reported the cases. Among them, a dentist is manipulating all the Reddening movements from within, so the incident has a tendency to expand.</p>
<p>In Yamagata Prefecture, the Education Labor Department branch of the All-Association System of Reddened Groups organized by elementary school teachers has seven key figures in the extreme-left illegal movement, including Takahashi Kozo, a teacher at Kashiwakura Kadota Elementary School in Minamimurayama District, who have been vigorously promoting the Reddening of elementary school children. Since the report, the entire student body has openly demonstrated in front of the Yamagata Police Station, distributing leaflets and demanding to meet with the authorities. At the same time, Sato Hisayoshi and others, students at the Meguro Telegraph Association's wireless telegraph training school, who are important members of the Communist Youth League, participated in violent movements on the Revolution Day of November 7th last year. They are divided into technical, organizational, and propaganda departments with a large scale. Sato, Sakaguchi, and Amano served as department heads, fiercely promoting the ideology. In addition, the Daikan-yama Police Station detected an unstable group gathering and plotting at the Reimei Society in Kojimachi Ward, and successively arrested left-wing elements centered on various employment agencies throughout the city.</p>
<p>The Proletarian Cultural League, as the center of the extreme-left Shanghai Movement, has been quite active recently. It has now been revealed by Professor Yamada Katsujiro and his wife of Kyoto Imperial University that they have a capital of more than 10,000 yuan, and have organized six groups: the Alliance of Proletarian Writers, the Proletarian Left-Wing Theater, Proletarian Art, and photography, film, and music. They have united six groups, including the Japanese Proletarian Science Research Institute, the New Education Research Institute, the Militant Atheist League, the Proletarian Birth Restriction League, the Japanese Proletarian Library, and the Japanese Proletarian Esperanto League, to form the Japanese Proletarian Cultural Grand Alliance. The Alliance headquarters is located in Kanda Ward, Mandai-cho, and its organ is called Red Flag. After the police station obtained the confession, they immediately arrested more than a dozen important figures, including the Central Secretary-General of the Cultural League, Viscount Okouchi Masatoshi's son, Okouchi Nobutake, Central Standing Committee members Nomura Jiro, Terashima Kazuo, Hatano Ichiro, and Onomiya Yoshikichi. At the same time, three or forty left-wing elements, including Saegusa Kazuyasu, the executive chairman of the All-Farmers Association of Yamanashi Prefecture, were also arrested one after another. In addition, Saito Hashimoto and other Tokyo Imperial University students, members of the Communist Youth League's Tokyo Imperial University cell, who held a secret meeting at the Sanmaru Restaurant in Hongo Ward on the 30th of last month, were also arrested. Others, such as Yamada Giichi, Aoki Hajime, and dozens of other students from Waseda University, as well as Inoue, Hasegawa, and several other left-leaning female students from the Tokyo Kojimachi Women's English School, were arrested together. However, judging from the recent situation, the left-leaning movement is almost like a prairie fire. All sectors of the intellectual community are participating in the planning, so the Metropolitan Police Department is arresting people without end.</p>

<p>Appendix: The League of Nations' Handling of the Sino-Japanese Dispute. C. Japan's New Policy. In the past, Japan refused to withdraw its troops, arguing that the anti-Japanese sentiment among the Chinese people was very strong. Therefore, the safety of Japanese residents' lives and property should be the primary concern before withdrawing troops. Later, because the Chinese government declared that it would be responsible for protecting Japanese residents, and said that if Japan did not believe it, it could also ask neutral countries to send personnel to participate in the protection work, the problem of Japanese residents' safety was easily resolved. At this time, Japan realized that this reason was not a good plan, and changed its strategy. On October 12th, in its reply to the chairman of the Executive Yuan's advice letter of the 9th, it said that in this serious situation, the urgent task was to restore the spirit of friendship and cooperation between China and Japan. To achieve this goal, China should first recognize several basic principles to maintain the diplomatic relations between the two countries. If China can recognize these principles, Japan will be able to withdraw its troops immediately. The Japanese government is willing to start negotiations with the Chinese government at any time, etc. However, the five principles mentioned were not explained in detail, so before the meeting started, all countries knew that the matter was already tricky.</p>
<h3 id="e122">D. The Process of the Second Meeting of the Executive Yuan <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Discussion of Inviting the United States to Attend the Meeting of the Executive Yuan. Among the important issues of this meeting was inviting the United States to send personnel to participate in the work of the Executive Yuan. Before the meeting, the British and French governments seemed to have obtained the consent of the U.S. government, and the U.S. government had also declared to the press before being formally invited that if the League of Nations invited the U.S. to participate in the meeting of the Executive Yuan, the U.S. government would gladly accept it. After this declaration was issued, the Executive Yuan was in a position where it was difficult to back down. However, Japan was most afraid of the U.S. cooperating with the League of Nations and interfering in its actions in China, so it strongly opposed it, which was expected. Therefore, the so-called constitutional issue arose.</p>
<p>Japan's opposition to the United States' participation was based on Article 4, Paragraph 5 of the League of Nations Covenant. That paragraph states that if a member of the League of Nations that is not on the Executive Council encounters an event that is specifically related to it when the Council discusses it, it may request that it send a representative to attend the meeting in the name of a member of the Executive Council, etc. Therefore, Japan said that according to the provisions of that treaty, only members of the League of Nations can participate in the meeting of the Executive Council. The United States is not a member of the League of Nations, so it cannot participate in the meeting of the Executive Council constitutionally. Now, the meeting of the Executive Council is based on Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, so even if the Executive Council wants to invite the United States to participate, it must be passed unanimously. In this way, Japan can have two ways to prevent the proposal, believing that it can definitely dispel the proposal to invite the United States. However, the representatives of various countries in the Executive Council believe that the cooperation of the United States is of great importance to the future of the League of Nations. No matter what, this goal must be achieved. When the Japanese representative sent a letter to Briand on October 15th, proposing the above-mentioned principles, Briand immediately replied that the cooperation with the United States was based on the fact that the Japanese representative had approved the resolution of September 30th, which said that the Executive Council should notify the United States of the progress of the discussion of the Sino-Japanese dispute at any time, and not based on Article 4, Paragraph 5 of the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, the Japanese representative's opposition was a misunderstanding. He also said that if the United States is willing to send personnel to attend the meeting of the Executive Council, it will not be in the capacity of a member, because it has no voting rights. As for the issue of inviting the United States to send personnel, it is only a procedural issue, so there is no need for the Executive Council to pass it unanimously. In order to delay the time, the Japanese representative again proposed to form a committee of legal experts to discuss this constitutional issue in detail. Who knew that the British Foreign Minister immediately asked the Japanese representative that if the Executive Council established a special committee to study this legal issue, would the representative be able to accept its report in advance? Then the Japanese representative again seized the opportunity to say no. Briand then put the Japanese proposal to establish a committee of legal experts to a vote. As a result, except for the representatives of Japan and Germany, the rest opposed it. The chairman then put the original proposal to invite the United States to participate to a vote. As a result, except for the Japanese representative, everyone unanimously approved it. This was the situation of the secret meeting on October 15th. When the meeting was held on the 16th, the chairman announced that the Executive Council had decided to invite the United States to send personnel to attend the meeting of the Executive Council based on yesterday's resolution, hoping that the Japanese representative would also express his sympathy. The Japanese representative said that he could not change his previous intention. The Polish representative said that the reason why he supported the United States' attendance at the meeting of the Executive Council was because he recognized that the resolution was a separate matter and had nothing to do with the interpretation of the League of Nations Constitution. Representatives from Yugoslavia and Norway also made similar statements one after another. The intention was to recognize that this invitation to the United States to attend the meeting of the Executive Council was based on the resolution of September 30th and not based on any article of the League of Nations Covenant, so it could not be used as a precedent in the future. In fact, it was to prevent the Soviet Union from participating by analogy, because the Soviet Union is one of the major countries that are not at war and the Pacific Ocean. Its status is no different from that of the United States. A dispute ended here. When the meeting was held on the afternoon of the same day, the United States sent its consul general stationed in Geneva to attend. Representatives from various countries gave a warm welcome, but the Japanese representative remained silent. A few days later, the Japanese representative said that the reason why the Japanese government opposed the United States' attendance in the past was because of the differences in the interpretation of the League of Nations Covenant, and it had nothing to do with the United States.</p>
<p>(2) The Movement to Apply the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Since the U.S. representative had already attended the meeting of the Executive Council, if the application of the Kellogg-Briand Pact could not be carried out, it would lose the meaning of cooperating with the U.S. Therefore, on October 17th, representatives from various countries exchanged opinions on the application of Article 2 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The meaning of that article is that if signatory countries encounter disputes, regardless of the cause and nature, they should only use peaceful methods to resolve the negotiations. As a result, it was decided that the governments of various countries should instruct their diplomatic representatives stationed in China and Tokyo to advise the governments of China and Japan to strictly abide by the obligations of Article 2 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the French government should notify all signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to make the same statement. After receiving the notification from the French government, the U.S. government issued the same advice. After receiving the advice, the Chinese government replied on October 22nd, saying that China has always abided by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and Japan is now clearly violating it. The signatory countries should immediately correct it. The Japanese government's reply also arrived on the 23rd, divided into three points: (1) It claimed that the advance into the eastern provinces was out of self-defense and denied violating the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (2) Japan wanted to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute peacefully and was willing to negotiate directly with China. (3) It accused the Chinese government of inciting the people to carry out anti-Japanese activities.</p>
<p>(3) The Debate on the Japanese Air Force Bombing Jinzhou. The debate on the bombing of Jinzhou was very pleasant. When the representative of our country questioned Japan's reason for bombing Jinzhou with large aircraft, the Japanese representative said that Chinese troops were concentrating in Jinzhou to endanger the Japanese army, so the Japanese army headquarters sent aircraft to the area to investigate the situation. Because the Chinese troops fired on the Japanese aircraft, they dropped bombs in self-defense. Representative Shi said that last year, an American aircraft arrived in Tokyo. Because the entry procedures were not in compliance, it was detained by the Japanese government. Now, Japan sent military aircraft to Jinzhou. Not only were the procedures not in compliance, but they were also carrying bombs. The purpose must be known. Moreover, the Chinese army in Jinzhou has no anti-aircraft guns, which shows that the Japanese aircraft was not attacked. The Japanese army has harmed the lives and property of the Chinese people for no reason. The resolution of the Executive Council on September 30th has been completely destroyed. The Japanese representative knew that he was wrong, so he only said that his opinion was different from that of the Chinese representative and there was no need to say more. The onlookers were even more resentful and also expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese army's actions. This was the general situation of the two meetings on October 13th.</p>
<p>(4) The Preparation Process of the Draft Resolution on October 22nd. From the 16th to the 22nd, representatives from various countries worked hard to draft the resolution, which was the focus of this meeting. The method was that the chairman first solicited opinions from both sides, and then discussed them with representatives from other countries, circulating back and forth, and drafting the draft based on the views of all parties. However, due to the differences in the opinions of the two sides, it was extremely difficult to carry out mediation. At that time, it was said that Briand was ill because he was exhausted from dealing with all parties, which shows his difficult situation. It is said that the draft submitted for discussion was the third revised draft because there were first and second drafts before, which were eventually abandoned. The content of the first draft took into account both direct negotiations and the deadline for troop withdrawal. Later, it was abandoned because the Japanese side opposed the deadline for troop withdrawal and our side opposed direct negotiations. The next day, rumors spread that the U.S. government opposed the deadline for troop withdrawal and was unwilling to continue cooperating with the League of Nations. Briand turned pale when he heard this and summoned neutral representatives to draft another draft, the content of which abandoned the deadline for troop withdrawal and advocated direct negotiations. After this draft was strongly opposed by Representative Shi, the British Foreign Minister received a report from his ambassador to the United States, saying that the U.S. attitude was the same as before, so the second draft was also abandoned. However, representatives from various countries realized that the meeting had been going on for a week and there was no way to change the Japanese representative's attitude. Therefore, on October 2nd, they submitted the third draft for voting. The content of the draft was divided into seven points: (1) Both parties have the obligation to abide by the resolution of September 30th. According to that resolution, Japan should withdraw its troops outside the South Manchuria Railway line in the shortest possible time, and China should use effective methods to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. (2) Please pay attention to the previous promises of both parties not to expand the conflict and stop the invasion. (3) Please pay attention to Japan's previous declaration of not annexing Chinese land, and recognize that this declaration is in line with the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty regarding respecting China's sovereignty, territorial administrative independence, and integrity. (4) Request Japan to start withdrawing its troops immediately and complete it before the Executive Council meeting on November 16th, and request the Chinese government to take effective measures to effectively protect the lives and property of Japanese residents and hire neutral countries to assist Chinese officials in implementing this resolution. (5) Suggest that the governments of China and Japan immediately send personnel to negotiate the methods of withdrawing troops and receiving lost territory. (6) Suggest that both parties, as soon as the troop withdrawal is completed, immediately conduct direct negotiations to resolve all issues related to this dispute and the Manchuria Railway. Therefore, both parties should jointly form a Sino-Japanese mediation committee or other similar institutions. (7) Decide to convene a meeting on November 16th to re-examine. If necessary, the chairman may convene the above-mentioned draft content in advance, although it may not satisfy us, but it can generally accept our country's advocacy of a deadline for troop withdrawal and rejection of direct negotiations. Diplomatically speaking, it can be said to be our country's victory. The representatives of China and Japan replied as soon as the chairman read out the case, agreeing to ask their respective governments for instructions.</p>
<p>(5) Japan's Counter-Proposal. At the 14th meeting on October 23rd, the representative of our country said that although the Chinese government was not satisfied with yesterday's draft, it was determined to accept it in order to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute as soon as possible. However, the Japanese representative still firmly opposed it and put forward a counter-proposal, the content of which was divided into eight items. The first, second, and third items were the same as the first, second, and third items of the original proposal, only with differences in wording, so they will not be repeated. However, the fourth to eighth items were completely different from the original proposal. The fourth item mainly said that in order to restore the state of peace, the governments of China and Japan should be requested to recognize several basic principles for maintaining diplomatic relations between the two countries, so that the lives and property of Japanese residents can be effectively protected. The fifth item was to suggest to the governments of China and Japan to immediately start direct negotiations to realize the advocacy of the fourth item. The sixth item asked the governments of China and Japan to send high-ranking officials to negotiate the methods of withdrawing troops and receiving lost territory. The seventh item asked the governments of China and Japan to report the progress of the implementation of the resolution to the Executive Council at any time. The eighth item authorized the chairman to convene a meeting of the Executive Council when necessary to review the implementation of this resolution (to be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e123">Biography of General Teng <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zunchang</p>
<p>The Japanese disturbed Shanghai. Our dead numbered thousands. However, they also killed more than their due. Righteous voices moved heaven and earth. But the death of General Teng, Chief of Staff of the Wusong Fortress, was especially heroic. It was more than forty days after his death that it was heard outside. But the praise and comfort did not reach him. His wife and children had no way to protect themselves from the cold and hunger. The world heard and mourned him. General Teng's name was Jiu-shou, and his style name was Qi-zhi. He was from Dujiang County, Guizhou. He was brave and had integrity from a young age. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Guizhou Army Lecture Hall and became the leader of a platoon in a certain army in Guizhou. He was repeatedly promoted to company commander, battalion commander, and regimental commander. In the fifteenth year, he entered Guangdong and was the main teacher at the Chaozhou Branch of the Central Military and Political School. The following year, he was the chief of staff of the Second Division of the Seventeenth Army. The following year, he was transferred to the chief of staff of the Twenty-ninth Division. He had meritorious service. In the winter of the eighteenth year, he was promoted to chief of staff of the Twenty-ninth Division. In the army, he was clearly different. He was strict in what he took and gave. He was ashamed of private fights. He only encouraged his subordinates to die for the country. His position rose day by day. People thought it was an honor. General Teng looked unhappy. When he heard that something had happened in the east, he often sighed. He became more and more self-disciplined. When the enemy invaded Shanghai, our Nineteenth Army was repeatedly defeated. The enemy then attacked Wusong with all their armor. The sound of artillery was heard for dozens of miles. The flames filled the sky. Wood and stone were all turned to ashes. People could not be seen five steps away. The fortress was in danger. General Teng received a letter to board the gun platform. Before he finished the steps, a bullet had hit his left arm. His clothes were all red. The crowd advised him to retreat. He refused. He fought hard despite his serious wounds. From morning to noon. The enemy was never able to succeed. Later, the artillery fire became more and more intense. A bullet pierced his left side. His upper body became minced meat. He then died for his country. It was the fourth day of the second month of the twenty-first year. He was only thirty-three years old. One hour after his death, we used a plan to cover up his main army. We shattered two enemy ships. The enemy was demoralized. Some said that it was General Teng's legacy.</p>

<p>— Cai Liang</p>
<p>This battle in Shanghai was fierce. It was truly unprecedented since the opening of the port. And the loyalty and bravery of our army in resisting the enemy has also been made clear to the world. Here are some interesting things that were not published in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Eating rice and adding vinegar. My friend Mr. Wang used to live in Baoxing Road in northern Shanghai. His residence happened to be next to a certain Japanese person. According to him, several days before the incident, he saw the family buying a large number of red and green papers. They were cutting and making various lanterns and ornaments and were extremely busy. It was as if they were having a large-scale celebration. He was very confused. When Yan Ze launched an attack, and the overseas Chinese acted as his vanguard, he realized that these people had harbored evil intentions for a long time. Unexpectedly, after the first exchange of fire, they were defeated. Therefore, joy turned into sorrow. They fled in panic. Later, it was learned that these people were increasingly terrified by the casualties of the repeated battles and defeats. They also regarded it as a major national disaster. For a time, all the overseas Chinese ate vegetarian food to express their grief. It was also heard that they added a little vinegar when they ate, which was also what is called punishing themselves.</p>
<p>The Drama of Snatching Corpses. The initial battles took place in the Hongkou area. Therefore, the roads connected to the Chinese areas were the scene of fierce fighting. However, because the area was located in a city, there were many secluded alleys. The enemy was unfamiliar with the terrain. It was easy to attack but difficult to defend. Therefore, every time they were defeated, they left behind piles of corpses. The enemy was unwilling to abandon their dead soldiers. It was once heard that during one of our army's pursuits, we suddenly saw enemy sappers crawling in from the side. At first, we thought they were coming to help in the battle. Unexpectedly, when they approached the front line, they stopped. Then we saw these people frantically picking up their remains, flags, and other items. Our army immediately fired at them with machine guns. Most of them did not survive, it is said.</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The American intellectual class's movement to impose economic sanctions on Japan for using force to oppress China and disrupt world peace is beginning. Unfortunately, our people's work of resisting goods seems to be declining! At the same time, treacherous merchants in Tianjin and Qingdao are smuggling a large number of enemy goods. It is said that many have arrived in Shanghai. This tragic phenomenon is so disappointing and heartbreaking! In times of national crisis, there is only the common life and death of the entire nation. How can there be welfare for individuals and families? At this moment, regardless of the government's attitude, our people's determination to sacrifice for the country will never change! As for the methods of resisting goods, secret work is better than public activities. Our patriotic warriors, shop assistants, sailors, and customs officers should hold a spirit of great fearlessness, deeply monitor the actions of treacherous merchants, and take the most severe measures against them!</p>

<h3 id="e126">Machine Guns <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Machine guns are divided into heavy and light types. Heavy machine guns were invented two hundred years after the invention of artillery. In 1400, there was something called Organs, which consisted of six or more and twenty or fewer gun barrels arranged side by side. In the sixteenth century, the Dutch created the harp cannon. During the Franco-Prussian War, the German army used this cannon, which was closely connected to twenty automatic rifles, for attack and defense. In 1860, the Gutoling machine gun was born. In 1883, the German Maxium invented the automatic machine gun. As a result, the technology shone brightly. German Emperor William I greatly appreciated it. At that time, our country's ambassador to Germany personally saw its ingenious structure. He personally tested it in Berlin. It was indeed fierce and unparalleled. He urgently wanted to purchase it, but he terminated the contract halfway because he thought the price of 200 yuan per piece was too expensive. This is the shortcoming of our people. Later, France invented the Hochiks automatic gas machine gun, which was even more fierce. During the Sino-Japanese War, Japan used Maxium machine guns to inflict its violence everywhere. At this time, our country only had a small number of local guns and old-fashioned rifles, so it could not resist. During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan also adopted the Hochiks automatic gas machine gun. When Yang Yuling was the general manager of the Northeast Arsenal, he hired German and French technicians to manufacture thousands of them. I don't know who has them now.</p>

<p>— Master of the Studio of Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter 4: An Arranged Marriage Pressures Him, He Wanders in Doubt; Enemy Flames Burn the Land, A New Conflict Begins</p>
<p>Under such a state of infatuation, regarding the perfectly logical arranged marriage with Li Wenxia, he couldn't help but hesitate and feel extremely anxious. He tossed and turned all night, finally falling into a hazy sleep at dawn. He didn't know how long he had slept when he was suddenly awakened by the tea boy shouting loudly outside the window, saying that there was a phone call from the Liang residence for him. He hurriedly threw on his clothes and went out to answer the phone. It was Liang Xiaoyun speaking coquettishly on the phone, saying, "I've been up for half the day. Since you've been feeling unwell these past two days, you probably don't need to go to class. So, stop dawdling in the dormitory. Why aren't you coming over here?" He felt secretly ashamed that he was getting up later than a fashionable lady. What else could he say? He could only agree to come right away. After hanging up the receiver and running back to his room, he splashed water on his face haphazardly as if his eyebrows were on fire. He hurriedly put on a Western suit and, after finding the golden box, put it in his pocket. He no longer allowed himself any room for consideration or thought, nor did he have time to worry about the later appointment with Li Wenxia tonight. He only had one thing on his mind: getting to the Liang's house. As he walked to the door of the accounting office inside the dormitory gate, a postal messenger was delivering many letters. The accountant conveniently stopped him and handed him a letter. In his haste, he glanced at the envelope and recognized that it was sent by his uncle, An Dakui. However, it was not an express or registered letter. He guessed that there was no remittance inside, and he was slightly disappointed. He took the letter and ran out, jumping into a familiar rickshaw. He told the driver to go to the Liang's house. Only after the rickshaw reached the main street did he slowly open the letter to read it carefully. Who knew that it would have been better if he hadn't read it? Upon reading it, he was shocked and dismayed, experiencing another unexpected blow and feeling an extremely uncomfortable distress. He was stunned in the rickshaw for a moment. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw had already stopped in front of the Liang's house. In a daze, he got out of the rickshaw, paid the fare, and stuffed the letter into his pocket. Just as he was about to press the doorbell, he saw that the door of the Liang's house was already open. Outside the door, there was another hired car parked, which he recognized as the one used by Wei Zhuomou. The rickshaw driver and the doorman of the Liang's house were standing at the door chatting. When they saw him, a familiar acquaintance, they greeted him in unison. The doorman led him inside, smiling as he said, "Miss and Mr. Wei are both in the study." He went straight into the study and saw Liang Xiaoyun and Wei Zhuomou reading English at the desk.</p>

<p>It is rumored that the United States will hold a silver conference. Yesterday, the gold standard price was slightly short. The trend was stable. There were over seven taels of retrospective examination between morning and noon. In the end, it fell by one tael and zero. However, the opening was still good. It is likely that the silver market has not changed, and people's hearts are stable. Exchange rates rebounded greatly, and foreign exchange went from tight to loose. Later, it was heard from bankers that the United States would hold a silver conference. Upon hearing this news, the market atmosphere became sluggish, and selling became courageous. The price could not be sustained. It fell from 710 taels back to within 03 taels. In the afternoon, due to the usual Saturday holiday, the situation this week continued to be sharp. It had already broken through the 700 tael mark at the beginning of the week. However, it was always difficult to recover, and there were often over ten taels of foreign exchange every day. The minimum price was 687 taels and a half, and the maximum price was 712 taels and eight coins. The difference between the highest and lowest prices was over 25 taels. Compared to last Saturday, it rose by 16 taels and seven coins, which was affected by the continuous decline in the silver market. Here is a detailed record of yesterday's market:</p>
<p>The market was short by one tael and zero. The opening price in May added four taels to 708 taels and five, and the large bars did not change. It was expected that the rebound would not be successful. Subsequently, there was a fluctuation of one and a half taels. Hong Kang Yongyu and others all had sales, so it fell to zero six taels and eight coins. In a moment, Yuan Heng Yuanmao and others came to enter, immediately adding more than two taels to zero nine taels and two coins. At that time, due to the exchange rate coming out, the recent English gold was one shilling and eight pence. In addition, Qian Changxiang and others went out to zero seven taels and a half at more than nine twenty minutes. When the exchange rate was listed as before, the US dollar added one two five due to the rise in the exchange rate. At this time, the meeting price was still flat, at zero eight taels and two coins. All internal US dollars were absorbed by McCallum at a recent price of thirty-one yuan six two five. Moreover, Zhifeng Yongyuan Kangxiang and others entered the market, and in just ten minutes, the price rose by two taels to 710 taels. Unexpectedly, a foreign telegram came with news of a silver price conference and that Chase Bank planned to buy spot silver. People's hearts were frightened. Major dealers such as Wu and Yufeng Yongcheng Feng Yongyi Feng Yongdaxing Yongyuanmao tended to sell. In addition, the bank's buying price for US dollars was 32 yuan, and all numbers had throwing sales to 7 months which was even over thirty-two yuan zero six two five. Therefore, from nine thirty to ten thirty, a total of over seven taels were poured out, only zero two taels and eight coins. After that, it was learned that a certain bank had entered 140 spot bars at a price of 700 taels, which was sold by Yingfeng Heng and others. With this, the market price slightly rebounded by more than two taels. The Dalian gang and others entered the market to buy, and it was zero five taels and two coins around eleven o'clock. After that, the situation was peaceful, but the price still depreciated by a few coins. Fuyu Yuanmao zero households and others all exited, and there were also some scalpers who had to flatten, so they had to spit it out when noon came, and it suddenly became zero two taels and five coins. Then, the closing price was zero three taels and two coins, which was one tael and three coins lower than the previous day. The maximum in half a day was ten taels, and the minimum was zero two taels and a half. There were a total of seven and a half taels of retrospective examination. The listed price was changed to 771 taels, with a pressure of 61 12 taels 68 9 taels. The registered amount was 697 taels to 703 taels. The water replenishment was 97 taels. The bare bars added four taels and two five. On the table, the transaction statistics were higher for the selling price than the buying price: Zhifeng Yong · Yuchangxiang · Chengfeng Yong · Yifeng Yong · Yuanmao · Yuhe · Hong Kang Yong all exited. Shunli · Wanxing · Hengyu · Dadecheng · Richang all entered. Yuantai · Yuankangxiang · Futaiheng and others had mixed entries and exits.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Situation of the Exchange Market Revolving <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, the foreign exchange market was only open for half a day in the morning. HSBC listed only a US dollar addition of one two five, for thirty-one yuan one two five, a franc addition of three yuan, a German exchange addition of seven five, and a Japanese exchange addition of two five. There were no other stretches. English gold was still one shilling seven pence seven five. As for the internal market, it was firm at first and then flat, and the gold market also rose in the morning and then fell. Until noon, both English and American exchanges were neither prosperous nor declining compared to the night before. Chinese merchants were still trading tirelessly. It is estimated that English gold was only slightly brushed with twenty or thirty thousand pounds. US dollars totaled about four hundred thousand yuan, mostly sold in futures, while settlements were very few. Internally, return slips were set, and Citibank slightly sold. The market situation seemed to be revolving.</p>
<p>English Exchange: The internal market was very flat with few changes. The swap was only counted as 0625. From the early opening, the recent selling price was one shilling eight pence, the buying price was 0625, the forward selling price was eight pence ten 0625, and the buying price was one two five. HSBC first offered eight pence this month, and Zhengjin offered the same price in July. The noon closing was the same as the early market.</p>
<p>US Exchange: There was a 1875 rotation in the internal market in half a day. The swap was separated by two five.

The noon closing near-term offer price was six eight seven five, the buying price was eight one two five, the forward offer price was eight one two five, and the buying price was thirty-two yuan zero six two five. It also listed one yuan, equivalent to three taels two coins one point two eight five, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Large Bars Continue to Trend Downward <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>

Bombay, 8th Telegram: The Bombay large bar opened at fifty-three rupees one zero in the near term and fifty-three rupees one two in the forward term, both unchanged from yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Trend of the Exchange Rate Declining <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Currently, foreign funds have become abundant due to the suspension of their intended uses and the increase in sources. Therefore, the price of foreign exchange is declining every day, with a great trend of falling like a river. Yesterday, it continued to fall by two li compared to the previous morning. The morning market was seven qian zero seven li one hao two hu half, and the noon market was seven qian zero six li half. The silver exchange market was unified at one qian four fen, also falling by one fen compared to before. The bank listed at six fen, with a premium of two qian half to two qian. The situation was also relatively loose. The amount of foreign exchange heads made in the morning market was 345,000, and in the noon market was 235,000. The amount of banknotes was 10,000 in the morning market and 20,000 in the noon market. The amount of checks was only 230,000. The silver transaction only opened in the morning market at 300,000. The amount of bank collection was over 2.8 million from Chinese merchants, over 300,000 in taxes, over 2.5 million from foreign merchants, and over 300,000 in mortgage exchange. There was no news of exchange collections. Money houses collected over 4.7 million in foreign public orders, and over 36 million in silver public orders. Small money houses bought and sold over 200,000. In Jiangnan, the small foreign market was the same at six qian one fen six li in both the morning and noon markets. The transaction was only 2,500 jiao in the morning market. In Guangdong, the small foreign market was the same at six qian one fen nine li in both the morning and noon markets. The transaction was 95,000 jiao in the morning market and 15,000 jiao in the noon market. The copper yuan added 2,500 wen, for a total of 410,000 wen.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Long-Term News Is Bleak <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>In previous years, around early April, there would have been a small number of six-month long-term funds due today (the 10th), with various news of settlement, new transactions, and continuation. However, this time, there was no news at all. The reason for this is nothing more than the situation and market conditions. However, it was found that most of the long-term funds that expired at the end of last October failed to be repaid as desired. Instead, they were vaguely resolved with a plan to transfer to current accounts. It was expected that they could be cleared at the end of the year, but the national crisis of January 28th occurred, and the entire city was suspended. Subsequently, the deadline for completion was postponed several times, but no agreement was reached. It has not been resolved to this day. According to the notice from the City Chamber of Commerce, the overall deadline is the end of May. Therefore, the handling of long-term deposits, collections, and transfers in mid-April is difficult to manage. As a result, the usually good long-term news every year has become bleak and silent.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Securities Exchange Prepares to Resume Business <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps doing a closed-door settlement transaction first and formally opening the market still requires waiting for the current situation to ease more than before, and the financial situation has also been very good. The prices of various bonds in the securities market are quite firm in the unofficial market. The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange could have opened earlier, and even brokers have requested resumption of business. However, the exchange is still taking a cautious approach and waiting and seeing. Moreover, there are still no instructions from the Ministry of Finance, so it has not yet resumed business. It is planned to first conduct closed-door trading next week or temporarily open closed-door settlement transactions. As for formally starting new buying and selling, it is still necessary to obtain instructions from the Ministry of Finance. However, judging from the current environmental situation, if the situation does not deteriorate further, the resumption of business in the securities market will definitely not be far away.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Selling Price of Existing Yarn Weakens <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A portion of the Cantonese merchants are purchasing coarse yarn.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still sluggish, and the selling price is falling. The situation is very loose because the factories are very willing to compromise. However, the actual demand is more than yesterday. A portion of the Cantonese merchants purchased over 700 bales of Shuangxi coarse yarn with 10 strands, which were continuously distributed. There are also active signs in Tianjin. However, according to a portion of people, the northern region was originally expected to have strong sales, but it was preempted by Japanese merchants. Therefore, sporadic transactions or other gangs are constantly affected by the war, making it difficult to return to Suzhou for a while. After the war, the financial situation will not be easy to restore, so there is no active hope for yarn sales in the short term. It was found that the total number of bales purchased by various gangs throughout the day was 1,520 bales, and the market fell by another five to seven and a half qian. The Hakka merchants in Guangdong imported 815 bales, Tianjin 350 bales, Sichuan 100 bales, the mainland 25 bales, Shantou 115 bales, Wenzhou 30 bales, the Northern gang 40 bales, and fellow traders 45 bales.</p>

<p>Arrivals are extremely sparse. The cotton market is still tired, with real sales quite clear. American cotton conditions are softening, while yarn sales are sluggish. The attitudes of the factories are extremely lax, but sources from all directions are dwindling. Inventories in this port and native cotton are extremely scarce, but there are tens of thousands of pieces of American cotton in various godowns. In the market, it is heard that Shenxin imported more than 1,000 pieces of Shaanxi cotton, priced at 34 taels 7 qian 5 fen, slightly higher than the market. This was imported by the Han gang. The yarn is 32-strand and 20-strand Ren Zhong cotton yarn. However, the yarn price has also increased, with 32-strand Ren Zhong at 250 taels and 20-strand Ren Zhong at 178 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was tired due to the Wall Street slump and profit-taking by bulls. It showed a slightly stable trend at the close. Futures rose by one to four pounds, spot prices rose by five pounds. British cotton futures fell by three points, spot prices rose by three points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged. Indian cotton was firm due to good news from Liverpool, with White Luo Creek rising by 2.25 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (telegram dated the 8th):</p>

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, more than a dozen numbers of sources in the Pujiang area, the store appetite in this street was quite refreshing. The top goods in the Pujiang area were few, and the opening price in the morning was stable for high-quality goods, and ordinary old goods all rose by two corners. The Ke Bang slightly purchased flooded rice, and the market price rose sharply by nearly one corner. The Yangdu tip sold quickly as soon as it arrived, and the market price rose by one corner. The overall change was smooth after the initial stagnation, and the market was slightly tight.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, fourteen or fifteen ships arrived on the West Road, and transactions on this street were still active. Tea shops bought nearly a thousand stones of Bo rice, and the price was two corners higher than yesterday. The price of rare metamorphosed Yuan goods rose by several fen. Early rice and Yangdu tip were neither prosperous nor declining. Changshu top japonica rice lacked goods and there was no market. Each cargo ship in the river factory opened with about 5,000 stones.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Foreign Rice Market Temporarily Remains Stable <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Han gang continued to handle the shipment of futures, which fell slightly by two to three fen. Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation initially showed a gradual decline in the market as Hakka merchants stopped selling. The appetite on this street was also weak, and people's hearts were trending downward. Subsequently, the Hankou gang suddenly continued to handle the shipment, and the whole market handled 2,300 bags of Xiaojiao rice. The local township also handled 2-300 bags each. The market immediately turned around. In addition to Xiaojiao, the local township also handled 600 bags of Chen Min Dang and 300 bags of No. 1 Saigon. In total, the market handled 3,700 bags of various types of rice. The prices were 9 yuan 6 jiao 9 fen for Xiaojiao Gao rice, 9 yuan 5 jiao 2 fen for the middle, 10 yuan 9 jiao to 10 yuan 7 jiao for No. 1 Saigon, and 9 yuan 8 jiao half for Chen Min Dang. Although the futures foreign firms have not sold out due to high prices in the producing area, the appetite of importers is even weaker. Yesterday, it was tired by a small two to three fen. It is estimated that 400 tons of recycled goods were opened in April, priced at 4 taels 6 qian 6 fen to 4 taels 6 qian 5 fen half.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Powder Market Suddenly Falls <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Floating buyers and hoarders took the opportunity to sell high. Yesterday, the powder market suddenly saw a decline. The trend of rising step by step over the past few weeks was suddenly overthrown. The sharp rise in existing powder in the middle of last month was driven by actual consumption. Later, there were chips of the five-month period battleship brand floating in the market, which were used by brokers, hoarders, floating buyers, and factories to push the boat along the water, manipulate and speculate. It was completely for the purpose of picking up high prices. The real sales gangs have already stepped back because they are too high. Even if there are a small number of real sales, the number is very small and has no great impact on the market. Yesterday, foreign wheat reported a small number of jiao to nearly yuan. The factory side did not dare to absorb a large amount. Floating buyers and hoarders took the opportunity to sell high, and the market suddenly saw a sudden drop. It is estimated that May is a small 1 fen 25, which is 2 taels 08 fen 25. The spot standard is 2 taels 07 fen 75, which also carries a small half fen.</p>

<p>Although Sichuan pickled mustard has continued to arrive recently, the inventory is still sufficient. In addition, sales in various directions have declined during the period of national crisis. Therefore, the market price was already cheap, and it has still seen a slight drop in recent days. Yesterday, the market only sold 16 to 17 yuan for Shangzhuang goods, and the price of the next grade was reduced by 2 to 3 yuan or so. The market is still not smooth.</p>

<p>Both Chinese and foreign parties are still in negotiations.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port, although American firms and others had an appetite for White Factory silks, the opening price was not high. The factory insisted on selling only if the price rose. Therefore, the Chinese and foreign parties are still continuing to negotiate, and transactions are pending. Yesterday, only Xinfu imported 10 packages of White Factory silks. Samsung and others imported 12 packages of yellow coarse silks at a firm price.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Piece Goods, Blue Striped Satin's Path Gradually Moves <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Piece goods transactions are still lifeless because the situation is uncertain and people are watching, so there is no wholesale path. However, since the weather has warmed and spring goods have shown slight activity, especially the blue striped satin trend is smoother. Shanghai's Sanyi Tu sells 1 qian 9 fen, and the spot goods are sold out. Lun Chang's 7 Rose is 1 qian 8 fen 7 li half, mostly purchased by the Yangtze River Ningbo gangs and this street. Blue striped twill is shipped from Changzhou to Shanghai every day because the sales season is approaching, and the price has slightly improved compared to before. Jinrenyi is 5 taels 7 qian half, and Da Deli is 5 taels 6 qian half. Blue striped bleached cloth from Ewo is quite scarce, and the Changzhou Shusheng Tu has fallen from 8 taels 5 qian to 8 taels 4 qian. Printed satin Lun Chang 7 Rose in dark color sells for 2 qian 3 fen, and white background sells for 1 qian 9 fen half. Shanghai Sanyi Tu of Five Poison Cloth opens at 5 taels 5 qian, and the door stores have quite a few transactions. Zhigong Ni and Fine Serge have no path at all. This factory's cotton cloth had almost no transactions yesterday because it was Saturday and could not be shipped for export today. The goods price was neither prosperous nor declining. Western goods are even more sluggish. Only the blue striped fuzhou silk for the lower body is slightly purchased on this street, all of which are goods around 3 qian.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Metal Tinplate Regains Rising Trend <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Metal transactions have been lacking in full development recently due to the tight silver situation. Although there are transactions, it is only for a few cumbersome items. As for major goods such as French Western nails, angle iron, and corrugated iron, there is still a lack of large-scale outlets. Therefore, the trend is mostly chaotic. However, the tinplate business has been the most popular since the market opened, with more than a thousand boxes being sold every day. The market supply is becoming increasingly shallow, and people's hearts are very firm because of this. The rising trend of the market is very strong. However, it was heard in the middle of last week that a lot of Gengzi Indemnity goods were shipped, which caused the market to be hit by it. The standard presented an outwardly strong and inwardly weak appearance. However, yesterday's news said that this goods has been collected by a certain association, and the general cargo holders have regained their strength. The standard has therefore rebounded. The current market price for 90-pound English goods is 10 taels 05 qian per box, 12 taels for 100 pounds, 12 taels 7 qian half for 90-pound American goods, 14 taels 9 qian for 100 pounds, 25 taels for 200 pounds, 27 taels for old steel mills, 31 taels for double-linked goods, and 45 taels for 35 pounds. It is heard that the total number of various goods sold throughout the city yesterday was more than 2,000 boxes. The buyers were the Sichuan, Tianjin, Hankou, and Fujian gangs.</p>

<p>Wave Talk</p>
<h3 id="e145">Reply to Mr. Cai Linsheng's Letter <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Linsheng,</p>
<p>Upon receiving and reading your letter, I was overjoyed beyond expectation. You instructed me to provide a certification and reply as soon as possible. I respectfully comply with your order and briefly describe one aspect, requesting your perusal.</p>
<p>When I was drafting the article, the sounds of cannons, airplanes, and bombs in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places had subsided. However, the sounds of cannons, airplanes, and bombs in Jiading, Taicang, and other places rose again. Observing this war, the significant losses suffered by our side were due to airplanes and cannons. Among these two items, the bombs from airplanes were particularly fierce and frightening. Because the various destruction tragedies in Zhabei, Wusong, and other places were mostly caused by airplane bombs. This made me recall a news item that this newspaper once published: "Mr. Cai Linsheng, the inventor of our country's aerial thunder, has been summoned by the government to engage in manufacturing." Assuming that Mr. Cai had indeed invented this kind of weapon, then there would be no need to worry about the enemy's airplanes and bombs. However, this news item has been reported for a long time. Why is it that the destructive actions of the enemy's airplanes and bombs are becoming more and more intense, while the effectiveness of aerial thunder is silent and unknown? Furthermore, I think this kind of news may not be accurate. Newspaper news originally takes "recording what is heard" as its principle, so among the news disclosed every day, there are many that can be confirmed by facts, but it is also unavoidable that there are some that are not entirely true. Just like flying multiple kites can also obstruct the airplane's air route, this kind of fallacy is also published in newspapers. Citing proof is one example. Therefore, I deeply suspected that this news item was also not a true event. Moreover, in Zhabei, Wusong, and other places, news frequently spread about planes shot down after the battle, but it was never heard that any of them were shot down by Mr. Cai's aerial thunder. The facts were clear, and I dared not conceal them. Therefore, I suspected that Mr. Cai may not exist, and aerial thunder may not exist. My hope was so urgent that my conjecture was occasionally wrong. Explaining this in order to talk about it is the basis of my argument. However, in my haste and anger, my wording was rash and disrespectful to Xizi. I secretly apologize for this. However, the world is declining and turbulent, and noisy clamor is rampant. Often, words do not match actions, and actions do not match words. Boasting becomes a trend, and people exaggerate each other. But upon examining the facts, there is a vast difference. There are countless such people. Therefore, Confucius said, "Listen to their words, but also observe their actions," also fearing that hermits are mostly those who steal vain reputation. Since this was the case in ancient times, it is even more so now. This is why I do not dare to hastily recognize something as true before seeing it with my own eyes. This is also why my words are rebellious and reckless.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after reading your letter, I found that it was indeed the truth. I couldn't help but clap my hands in celebration and was filled with both gratitude and shame. When the country is in trouble, extraordinary talents emerge. We will all watch with anticipation as you defend the country and resist disaster. It is a great honor. As for the military and political department's presentation and the aviation administration's certificate, I think they were not made public at that time, and I had no way of knowing. Now, after reading your letter, I understand the inside story. The facts are not false, and it is clear and understandable. However, what I hope for and want to see is not official documents such as presentations and certificates. I deeply hope that the aerial thunder can have a significant effect and the greatest success so that all 400 million compatriots can benefit from your service. Then I will again carry thorns and confess my guilt at your door. I have briefly stated the outline, and I hope for your understanding. In haste, I am infinitely terrified. I respectfully reply,</p>

<p>Guisheng, a Hunan native, was a lieutenant and attached platoon leader of the 7th Platoon, 3rd Battalion, 4th Regiment of the 19th Route Army. He died in battle on February 3rd on Yongxing Road, Shanghai. Every time he faced the enemy, he always led the charge, and the enemy scattered at the mere sight of him. During that battle, enemy soldiers fiercely charged our army's position from Yokohama Road and East Baoxing Road. He even took off his shirt, bared his chest, and used a machine gun to fight, shouting to kill the enemy, charging into the enemy lines. The enemy soldiers were so frightened that they collapsed and fled. Our frontline achieved a great victory, capturing seven enemy steel cannons and thirteen machine guns. The general was also struck by several bullets, yet still shouted, "Kill, kill, kill," advancing without stopping. He was truly a hero. His given name was Guisheng, his family name Yan. He was several feet tall with a heroic beard. He was familiar with tactics on and off the horse. The extraordinary essence of mountains and rivers resided in Xiangtan. He had experienced a hundred battles and dangers in half his life. His heart burned with the desire to wash away national humiliation. Although the enemy's atmosphere was evil, it could be overcome. He wished to stop the island bandits and bring peace to Jiangnan. He fought fiercely at the head of the river for ten days, and the enemy feared him like a roaring tiger. On February 3rd, poisonous fog filled the air. The battlefield was dark, and the sky was like ink. The enemy came like clouds, with both infantry and cavalry. Thunderous vehicles pressed down on the ground, towering high. He shouted loudly and tore his shirt, "What petty thieves dare to be so greedy? It is still easy for me to wipe you out before breakfast! Do not say that my blade is not sharp!" His chest was bare, his hair disheveled. He wielded an iron spear to drive away the ferocious brutes. Bullets flew from his hand faster than a sickle. Enemy soldiers were like grass, freely mowed down in one sweep. Our army followed, their horses unbridled, focused on charging into the enemy without looking back. The enemy's momentum collapsed like a crumbling cliff. In that battle, the enemy soldiers were completely annihilated. Only two or three survivors escaped. His body was also covered in a thousand wounds. Covered in blood, he fought even more fiercely. He would die for his country, and even death would be sweet. My strength is exhausted, my face covered in blood. He shouted loudly, baring his angry beard. Even as he died, he cursed the enemy incessantly. Alas, since the barbarian horses came trampling,</p>
<p>how can one bear to speak of the shattered mountains and rivers? The waters of the Liao River have turned blue. They seek to explore the thousand-mile gold city. Then they ascended the Great Wall, gazing menacingly like tigers. The armies abandoned their armor and fled in terrified panic. Yet there were also brave generals who could strategize, changing their allegiances and clinging to life shamelessly. Are they not seven-foot-tall men? How can they not feel ashamed when compared to Lord Yan? Only his body nourishes the eagles and vultures. Only his name is engraved in people's hearts. His heroic spirit in heaven is like a star toad, its light constantly shining on the peak of Mount Heng.</p>

<p>The news of peace talks is spreading widely. Telegrams about troop deployments fly about in confusion. (Recent special reports in various newspapers say that Sichuan soldiers and Zhang Fakui's troops have set out to aid Shanghai) How many truly love their country? Are they not just seeking fame? They sit idly by and watch the opportunity slip away. (If the reinforcements had arrived when the 19th Route Army had not yet retreated, then Shanghai would not have fallen, and the battlefield would not have spread to Jiading and Taicang) Let us not make an alliance under the city walls. (Formal negotiations began on March 24th) Thousands of broken walls remain. One sorrows when facing the setting sun. (If the government truly signs a treaty that humiliates the nation in order to seek peace, then I ask, how will it face the tens of millions of families in Wusong and Zhabei whose homes have been destroyed?)</p>

<h3 id="e148">Gun Cotton Making <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The warfare of the twentieth century is scientific. However, our country has never studied science. After the January 28th resistance against the enemy, we learned a good lesson and realized that our guns and cannons were far behind others. Therefore, we must now focus on science and use scientific methods to transform our guns and cannons. Now I will not talk about transformation, because I am not a scientist. What I will talk about is the most useful and important material in the manufacture of gunpowder: gun cotton. Now I will write it out for everyone to study together...</p>
<p>Gun cotton is made by soaking cotton in medicinal liquid. Its chemical formula is C6H7O2(NO3)3. If we want to make it roughly, we can use cotton waste from textile factories, plus one part nitric acid and three parts sulfuric acid, each placed in a pottery pot with a valve. Then slowly pour the nitric acid into the sulfuric acid, and use an iron rod to gradually mix them. Then cover the top. After several hours when it is completely cold, pour this mixed acid liquid into a pottery bowl of cold water. The bowl has an iron frame prepared in it. Soak the dried cotton waste (i.e., refined cotton) in this acid, and then stir it with an iron rod. Then drip the remaining acid on the iron frame. Repeat the soaking several times. The cotton consumes the acid, poured from the pot, while the cotton is being soaked. At this time, due to the action of nitric acid, a great heat is generated, so it must be cooled with cold water frequently. Most of the cotton in this bowl becomes roughly made gun cotton through this repeated soaking. After a few minutes, take it out with an iron hook. In this way, roughly made gun cotton is successfully produced.</p>
<p>Its shape and color are almost the same as refined cotton. However, once it is heated or impacted, it explodes immediately. Therefore, it occupies a very important and useful position in gunpowder.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Smelling Perfume Can Maintain Life: One Article <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Professor Max Weston-Schiller of Columbia University recently reported on the relationship between perfume and vitamins at the New York Electrical Association, which has attracted the attention of the scientific community. He said that smelling high-quality perfume is almost equivalent to absorbing the efficacy of vitamin A. The fragrance in perfume contains chemically generated nutrients. Therefore, in the future, with the advancement of chemistry, it may be possible to maintain life by only smelling perfume without eating food. Although this theory has not yet been tested by society and cannot be believed to be true, from the perspective of the physiological effect of absorbing the same nutrients as vitamin D when ultraviolet rays are directly shone on the body, it is not unreasonable to believe that smelling perfume can generate vitamin A in the body. Therefore, it can be determined that this theory is not false with future advancement in chemistry.</p>

<p>I remember when the sounds of gunfire and artillery fire filled Zhabei, I ran into a cloth store near my home to buy a few feet of coarse cloth. This "treasure house" was very big, as you could see from the fact that it occupied a long section of the street. Perhaps because of the "violent Japanese invasion and the suspension of business to resist humiliation," this "treasure house" only had two doors open, so naturally, buyers could enter and exit at will. Sure enough, "business was booming," with the air of "customers filling the hall." One of the shopkeepers was someone I knew, so I also politely greeted him as usual:</p>
<p>"How is business?" "So-so." "Oh? Then you haven't been affected by the war?" "Haha, if we can't open for business, how can we not be affected?"</p>
<p>"Ah!..."</p>
<p>Hmm, I understood that the so-called "suspension of business to resist humiliation" really caused them to suffer from the "violent Japanese invasion." So, in anger, I didn't buy any cloth and walked straight out. When I was walking out of the store, he pointed to a large container! of Japanese goods that had been sealed by a certain agency and said to me:</p>
<p>"Look, I really don't know when this big container of cloth can be unsealed."</p>
<p>I simply didn't have any appropriate words to answer him, so I walked onto the street dejectedly. These few words stayed with me. Today, because of my wife's nagging, I had to go and "patronize" his "treasure house" again. As I approached the door, I saw that the cloth store's doors were wide open, and a sign that read "Long-Term Resistance, Enduring the Pain and Opening for Business" had been put up on the wall. So I thought for sure that they wouldn't make things difficult for me today. Sure enough, as soon as I stepped into the store, the acquaintance called out to me from afar:</p>
<p>"Good morning!" So I also replied: "How is business?" "Yes, we opened for business yesterday!" He greeted me with a face full of smiles, even shaking my hand. He said:</p>
<p>"Spring has come, the sky is clear and it's getting warmer." So I catered to his psychology and said... "As long as the peace talks are successful, the world will be peaceful!"</p>
<p>Isn't that so? This is the patriotism of Chinese merchants!</p>

<p>Wife: "I think so too, but I heard that peace is not very reliable. If we go to Hangzhou, wouldn't it be terrible if there were any disturbances? It's better to go to the park to breathe some fresh air. But I don't know if the park is open?"</p>
<p>Husband: "The park? It's been open for a long time. We could go for a walk after the 19th Route Army withdrew from Zhabei."</p>
<p>Wife: "Hongkou Park? Or the Bund Park?" Husband: "For something more luxurious and Westernized, Zhaofeng Park is good. It doesn't matter if we spend a few more coppers." Wife: "Okay, let's go!"</p>

<p>Letter from Xia Renjie Since your newspaper created this science column, I believe readers are extremely pleased. I have a request. Our country has suffered a terrible calamity at the hands of Japan this time, and everyone is deeply saddened by the "bombing by airplanes." Not only are the ruins of Zhabei all caused by aerial warfare, but also, according to the officers and soldiers on the front lines, everyone laments the great destructive power of airplanes, and our country can do nothing about it. Now, even the most foolish person is loudly shouting that there are only two ways to save the country: one is to promote aviation, and the other is to buy more anti-aircraft guns. There are now many patriotic people who want to donate money to help, but there is no one to make concrete suggestions, and furthermore, many people do not know the details of this matter. Therefore, I am writing to request that you collect detailed scientific information on both airplanes and anti-aircraft guns for us, and that you can awaken everyone to give practical support. Then, even though my power is weak, I will resolve to donate a few percent of my salary each month, or unite with like-minded people to raise funds to buy them. I respectfully wish you peace. Xia Renjie, fifth day of the month.</p>
