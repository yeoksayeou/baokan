<p>在發起救濟東北難民援助東北義軍月捐運動之後。目前又有人在高喊着[游藝救國總動員]的口號，。發起舉行救濟東北難民遊藝大會。雖說這也不失爲救國之一道。但進一步作想這現象眞夠我們傷心。[救國]的呼聲不是從今天起在九一八和一二八事變發生的時候。差不多只要是一個中華民國的國民無不曾埀涙而道泣血而呼口有言言[救國。]筆有書書[救國。][武力收回失地][長期抵抗]的呼聲更是再接再厲然而到現在隔僅一年。就是這樣空口的呌喊也隨着冉冉的歲月零落了。消逝了而嶄然顯呈在我們眼前的事實則是關外成立了一個傀儡攻權閘北吳淞一帶盡成了一幅碎瓦頽垣觸目慘痛的圖畫還有便是東北義軍艱苦奮鬥的悲壯血跡和東北難民國未亡而身先淪爲奴隸的哀痛呼號。寒風起了。時届嚴冬一切的[老爺][太太][公子哥兒]和[摩登小姐]們。早已穿上了温煖應時的冬裝早已預備好了華貴的狐裘與電爐香檳酒之類在等待着[瑞雪]到來好細細領略[圍爐煑酒]或[踏雪訪梅]的樂趣然而東北的義勇軍呢在塞外早寒的冰天雪地之下他們只有隨着朔風飛舞的單衣只有冰冷的鐵只有艱苦而悲壯的飢餓只有英勇的鬥爭。只有洒遍了白山黑水之間的血和偉大的犧牲在這兩相比較之下。我們不能不承認[老爺][太太][公子][小姐]們的身體是太熱而東北義勇軍則太冷反之我們又不能不承認[老爺][太太][公子][小姐]們的心太冷而東北義勇軍則每一個人都有着一個充滿了熱力的心東北義勇軍的艱苦奮鬥是爲了什麽東北難民的流離輾轉又是爲了什麽。爲了爭取我們民族的生存爲了抗禦强暴爲了維護正義與公理那末他們的冷凍與飢餓是應該的嗎反之我們的温飽與享樂又是應該的嗎不應該便應該怎樣這裏我們每一個人都應該一埋頭沉思假如我們還没有成爲冥頑不靈的木石的話。從[高喊武力收回失地]到[沉寂無聲]從[沉寂無聲]到[遊藝救國]這是滑稽呢。是沉痛呢你看那侵略者國家怎樣說幹就幹說到什麽地方就做到什麽地方不空喊口號。也不流無謂的眼涙在社會經濟凋敝破落的時候。爲了侵略他們的人民還是對國家踴躍地捐輸我們呢爲了自衛爲了爭取民族的生存。有力的輸力有錢的助錢不更是應該的嗎。現在我們就改[武力收回失地]的口號爲[遊藝救國]罷大家來一個含涙的苦笑罷但少爺們小姐們這一回總希望你們也熱心一點踴躍一點。因爲不管是含涙的笑或是愉快的笑但由此你們旣完成了[遊藝救國]的任務。而東北的難民與義勇軍。却也受了你們的大賜。現在我們就高呼[遊藝救國]罷少爺們小姐們你們是否肯來一欣賞這充滿了血與涙的[救國]的遊藝。</p>

<p>原來日本自今年五月十五犬養毅氏在内閣總理任内被人暗殺之後、議會政治根本動搖、對立之兩大政黨所標榜的自由主義不單是無力而且是頽落、如果更老實一點的說軍國主義的勃興、簡直壓倒了欽定的憲法不過他們還可以解釋說日本的立憲政治并不是民主而是君主的、内閣并不完全對議會負責而是對天皇負責齋藤實内閣丨他們呌做協力内閣、其組閣之初原想撋攏各派、至少是政友會與民政黨兩大黨當中的優秀份子、出來担任閣員、成立所謂人才内閣可是實際上一般日本人都以爲這只是第二流人才的内閣、不過由政友會民政黨各出幾個部長次長等政務官員在組閣之初、就包含得有陸軍海軍和兩個不甚協調的政黨融洽在一起在他們自已說是恊力内閣其實是混合内閣、在齋藤内閣裏面有軍部的日本式法西式傾向有政友會的地主與三井系、有民政黨自由主義和三菱系而軍部當中又有陸海軍的爭功陸軍之中又、有緩進和急進的區别所以齋藤内閣成立之初、就陷於搖動不定的狀態、從六月到現在已經有了半年、齋藤内閣算是長命的了、他當前最大的困難、在豫算擬定的當初、所謂國防充實、軍備改善、對[滿洲]事變經費、時局匡救費、再加上各部院的新要求就已經超過了十四億日金如果全部承認、再加上一切的經常費用、則明年度豫算總額會有三十億、而歲收總計至多不過十二億八千六百萬日金、以是本現時國民經濟的情况、豈能担負何况滿洲問題到底幾時可以解决、[對滿事變費]要繼續多少長的時期、什麽時候幾可告一段落誰也不能豫斷、則是日本没有賺到錢之前、先要每年貼一筆丨至少一億三千二百萬日金的軍費進去、經過一度修改、陸軍部和財政部搗過無數的煩麻弄得内閣幾乎倒台費了若千調停、纔以九千五百萬圓日金特别增加給軍部算是暫時彌縫著當前的裂痕一九三三年度豫算、總計支出二十二億三千八百萬日金是是本開國以來的空前大豫算案每人平均担負三十一圓、這樣龐大的預算、在日本的財政界政治界、都以爲是日本當前危機足以導日本財政於破産之途但是軍部當局、却借口說這是非常時期、非出這樣巨大的預算不可而這次預算、却有兩個世所罕見的特點、第一個是預算不足額的塡補竟至完全用公債第二個是軍事費用之巨額的增加、一九三三年度的日本預算、國庫收入經常費只有十二億八千八百萬日金、再加上臨時收入也不過十三億四千一百萬圓日金相差還有九億日金、其餘的數目都没有他種方法增加收入可以塡補於是目前預計要發行的公債、如對滿洲事變費土木事業電話事業震災善後公債軍事改善費等等全部新預算、都要用公債來補其發行的數目至少要有八億九千六百萬日金、占全支出的百分之四十可是牠經常國稅收入之中、租稅收入有六億九千一百萬日金官有財産收入四億五千七百萬元日金印花稅收入六千七百萬日金與三四年以前的租稅收入相比較、從九億餘萬減到六億九千萬日金（由租稅的減少、可以窺見日本一般情形的困痛）以租稅收入和支出相比、不過僅及其百分之三十、比公債還要少十分之一軍事費的急劇增加同是日本預算案當前的癌腫、特别是近兩年以來增加得快而且大據牠的軍部、自已的解釋是滿洲事變的勃發所致、陸海兩部合計八億二千餘萬日金、把租稅收入全部都拿去作軍費、也還不足一億三千萬圓日金以軍費與全部支出相比較、實占百分之三十六而强記得一九一九年到一九二二年四年之間、日本軍費占支出總數的百分之四十二以至百分之四十九、那時候適當歐戰之後、又是對西比利亞出兵的軍事時期、所以軍費格外增加不過那時候的日本、却在大戰期中發了一百億以上的大財、國民經濟力、確實比現在堅實得多、而預算支出總計、不過十六億、從一九三○年起、軍費即開始減低、（那時是要作恢復金本位的準備）到去年即急增、由前年的百分之二十七而增加到百分之三十五明年要增加到百分之三十六而强、還不多少臨時費如對東三省增兵費用、没有算進去、雖然比日俄戰爭時軍費占百分之八十還少些、可是還不過是一種預算决算時一定要增加的、表面上雖然大槪定了、而政友會的三土鐵相與民政黨的山本内相爲了土木建築案正在由暗鬥而明爭進到肉搏的時期詳情如何、容待後報（十一月二十五日於東京）</p>

<p>— 法國P·Merimee作冰之譯</p>
<p>誰會告訴我太陽究竟是出來的時候最美呢，還是落下的時候最美？誰會告訴我究竟橄攬樹是最美的樹呢，還是杏仁樹是最美的樹？誰會告訴我究竟瓦朗斯人是最勇敢的人呢，還是安達羅齊人是最勇敢的人？誰會告訴我那個是婦人　面的最美者？丨我我告訴你那個是婦人襄面的最　者：這是阿洛德瓦加斯，托勤得的珍珠。　　黑人杜札尼呌人把他的矛拿來，呌人抒他的盾拿來：他的矛，他用右手握着；他的盾掛在他的頸下。他下樓走到他的廐房裡，他一隻一隻地注视着他那四十四牝馬。他說道：丨柏爾查最强壯：我會把托勒得的珍珠載在她那寛大的　部上帶回來的，不然的話，我便永遠不會再回哥爾多了。他動身了，他乘着馬走着，他到了托勒得，他在札加丹附近遇着一個老頭兒　。丨白　的老翁喲，請你把這封信送給朱狄耶先生，朱狄耶，德沙爾　拿先生。如果他是一個男兒的話，他會跑來亞爾瑪米泉附近和我交戰的。托勒得的珍珠當屬於我們兩人裏面的一個。老頭兒接過了信，他拿着那封信送給德沙爾　拿伯　，那時伯爵正和托勒得的珍珠在下棋。伯爵讀了那封信，讀了那封戰書，用手猛力的拍着桌子，桌上的東西全都震落了。他隨卽立起身呌人抒他的矛拿來，呌人抒他的良馬帶來；而托勒得的珍珠也立起身，渾身戰慄着；因爲她知道他是去决鬥的。丨朱狄耶大人，朱狄耶·德沙爾　拿先生，請你留着罷，我求你，請你留在這兒再和我下棋罷。丨我不再下棋了，我要到亞爾瑪米泉附近去玩玩矛槍。阿洛的眼涙不能阻住他；因爲没有什麽能夠阻止一個騎士去决鬥的。於是托勒得的珍珠穿着她的披風，跨上她的　子，向亞爾瑪米泉走去。泉水周圍的草地是紅的。泉水也是紅的。但染紅了草地。染紅了泉水的，並不是一個基督敎徒的血。黑人杜札尼仰天睡着；朱狄耶先生的矛已經折斷在他的胸裡；分报有的血漸漸地消失着。他的牝馬柏爾查流着眼涙瞧着他，因爲她不能夠治好她主人的槍傷呀　。托勒得的珍珠從她的骡子上降下。丨騎士啊，請你放勇敢點罷！你還會活下去，將來可以娶一個漂亮的莫勒斯格女人；我的手曉得醫治我的武士留下的槍傷呢。丨啊，這樣潔白的珍珠喲，這樣美麗的珍珠喲，請你把這割裂我的胸口的槍片拔出來罷！這寒冷的　矛使我凍結而且發抖。她毫不疑心的走近去；但他再鼓起了他的氣力，用腰刀的刀鋒，劃傷了那麽漂亮的面貎。</p>

<p>［自由談］，正可以當作自由［臺］，在這［臺］上，我們可以自由的［表演］，那便　是自由的［談］。到昨天爲止，這臺上所［表演］的，已告一段落了，閉幕了。從今天起，新的活動開始，幕又要重新開了，。其中有些什麽，這裏也不多談，瞧着罷。不過在觀衆渴欲知道幕内情形以前，我們這些［臺上人］，却不能不將我們的態度槪述一下。　　我們認定世界上的一切都在進步中，都在近代化，一則理論上應該，二則事實上需要。我們以爲我們的生活之涵養，大有賴於文藝，而文藝之應該進步與近代化，需要進步與近代化，乃是當然的事實。我們此後在這［臺上表演］些什麽，雖然在節目方面，不能預先一一的報告出來，而我們對於進步和近代的立足點却是要牢牢站定的，即便　是一些插科打諢，一些裝腔作勢，我們也不敢隨便應付。　　但是話還得說回來些。我們雖然不肯搬演猴子戲，模仿人的作爲，以博觀衆一笑，不肯唱幾句十八摸，五更相思，或者哼幾句［雲淡風輕近午天］，以遷就一般的低淺趣味，而我們也决不願大唱高調，打起什麽旗號，吹起什麽號筒，出什麽堂堂正正［像煞有介事］的雄師，以宣傳什麽主義，將個人或一小部份人的嗜好，來勉强大多數人的口味。我們只認定生活的要素，文藝，是應該而又需要進步的，近代化的；同時却也不願離觀衆太遠，［自敲鑼鼓自唱戲］，只在［臺裏喝彩］。幕在開了，自由的［臺］在出現了，臺上的人在自由的［表演］了，瞧着罷。乂乂乂乂</p>

<p>— 葉聖陶</p>
<p>［自由談］，這是一個幻影似的名詞。從前秦始皇的時代，兩個人在路上碰見了，停了步談一句兩句話，就犯死罪，談的什麽話是不問的。後來雖然没有這樣乾脆簡單的法令，但是一方面有示範作式的敎條，敎訓人談話應該怎樣談；另一方面又有多少多少條的律文，禁止人談話不許怎樣談。在這雙方夾迫之下，即里還［自由談］？</p>
<p>我們聽到的一些談論，看到的一些文字，都是苟存在這雙方夾迫的狹縫裏的。不觸着這一邊，也不冒犯那一邊，纔得說出來寫下來，給我們聽到看到。如果超過了這個限度，談論就只好　下肚去，讓他爛掉：文字呢，劈版，收燬，禁止投遞，他的災難何止一端。於是我們就無緣聽到看到了。　　環境如此，人就變得異樣地機警圓滑。怎樣纔能在雙方夾迫的狹縫裏轉側自如，成爲立言持論的人的必修科目。對於這科目修習得太到家了，有時竟會起一種幻覺，把自已所處的狹縫收縮得更狹一點。試舉一個例子。近來北平有許多學者主張定北平爲文化城，撤除軍備，免遭日本飛機大砲的蹂躪；但是在他們的意見書裏，郤只含胡地指稱［敵人］，絶對不見［日本］二字。他們大槪這樣想：若在這［未雨綢繆］的意見書裏交代明白，說爲的是日本，未免太使日本難堪了。　　想談張君，恐怕張君生心，不談。想談李君，恐怕李君動怒，不談。談談甲事乙事吧，又恐怕和甲事乙事有關的趙君王君不高興，也只好不談。於是談天氣。但是說天氣不好，也許會冒犯了這冥漠無言的大自然，忽地來一陣烈風暴雨，吹痛了頭腦，沾濕了衣裳；這還是不行。［推車着壁，］只有說天氣好是唯一妥當的辦法。所以，兩個人遇見了，往往異口同聲地說，［今天氣好呵！］</p>

<p>丨記某一次宴會丨</p>
<p>在四馬路的一角酒樓上集合了一羣舞弄筆桿的［好漢。］　　［好漢］一共是二十四條丨丨男的整整地二十，女的整整地兩雙。這裡面有兩雙［未妻將，］一雙是李大超先生和王孝英夫人，另一雙是［遵高望重］的老將陳望道先生和他的主編微音的太太蔡蔡女士。　　難說同是［好漢］但也許是因爲從前不曾相打過，所以大家都不很相識。於是在一羣［沙中偶語］之中，便有人趕着［從軍］的冰瑩呌［在黑暗中］的丁玲，也有人趕着編微音的蔡女士呌廬隱，更有人在低低地　問［那一個是幽默］的林語堂？那一個是令人顚倒的張　平？　　一陣忙亂之後，好漢便各割據了一席。於是慢慢地，地下便丢滿了瓜子殻，空中塞滿了烟圈，每一個［好漢］的臉上都淡淡地掛着一綫笑容，在等待另一［好漢］的發問，在尋覓一個適當的談話題材。在一羣顧雜的聲音中，活躍着每一顆愉快的心。　　入席了，好漢們一字形的被分爲三堆。在席間，冰瑩小姐殷殷地問到張資平先生新造的房子，新的創作，以及何時請吃飯，而張先生的答覆則是小的茅　，老朽，····之類，於是便　有人爲張先生加上［著作資本家］的頭銜，並主張大家搬進他的新房子去住。　　林語堂先生未到終席，點點頭，打個招呼，獨個兒幽默地走了；而愛寫小品文的謝六逸先生則常是埋頭吃菜，仰天吹烟圈，不大說話。酒過三巡，菜上三道，於是主人便站起來說話，謙和而文雅地報告了這頓酒是不易吃的，吃了還有下文····，大家爽然而又釋然。　　接着便是各個人稱名道姓的自我介紹，還是從李大超先生起，　　［我，李大超，廣東人！］胡愈之先生的自我介紹是：［我胡愈之，在東方雜誌做一點不相干的事　。］［她個不相干的事體，］一陣哈哈的笑聲。玩無綫電把戲的曹仲淵先生調皮而又滑稽的說，　　［我曹操的曹，號仲淵者，行二，而爲曹孟德的兄弟也。］　　於是又是一陣哈哈的笑聲。然而萬幸萬幸這天幸而没有人姓［王］····。最末尾的是高小姐，［我］字之後，聲音低到聽不見。有人在低低地喊：［再來一個，］但終於也就馬虎過去了。　　介紹過後，空中仍然是充滿了，笑說，和烟圏，喝酒，吃菜，大家重新抖擻精神全體動員，而我們的主人丨黎烈文先生，更是　　的新嫁娘似的，帶着莊嚴而紅暈的面孔如像［羅通殺四門］一樣，在每一堆忙亂的手叢裏都分得了一杯羹。菜完了，杯盤狼藉了，大家才放下一隻忙亂的手，臉上　出滿意的笑。　　又是一陣點頭和握手，好漢們去也，在靜夜的燈光下，大家各自走上自已的歸途。乂乂乂乂</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>林海泉在曾炳垣敎授的家中寄住一個多月以後，才知道每天像親姊妹那樣照指他的丨關於他的日常生活十分開心的丨東洋太太，是他的父執同時是受業歸曾敎授的第三夫人。這是一個姓唐名耀星的同級生在今早上才告訴他知道的。［原來如此。怪不得她這是那樣年輕。原來是人家的姨太太。］林海泉坐在黄包車上，覺得自已今天在精神上起了一個絶大的變化。至於片樣的變化，他自已也莫名其妙，不能具體地表示出来。他只覺得自唐耀星各訴了他這個秘密以後，他感着一　失望，同時又像發見了一個奇跡　　［她今年到底有多少歲數了？不出三十吧。····恐怕超過了三十呢。不過，她是擅長化槪，修飾得像一個時髦的女學生一樣但是和她正面相對時，便可以發見她的顔面上的中年的特微，丨丨雖然很微小，但是不能否定的。···］曾敎授是位經濟學專家，從日本的早稻田大學回來後，又在歐洲大陸丨丨德國和法國丨丨住了兩年餘，於前年冬才回來上海。他自發表了兩三種巨部的着譯後，便一　而爲出版界的聞人了。現在是乂乂大學的經濟係主任，某機關的參事，兼某銀行的顧問。在黨國要人眼中，固然値不得什麽但是尙留在特種的動物園丨丨中國的高等學府丨丨中，如像林海泉一般的靑年眼中，確是一位令人欽羡不已的人物了。　　當海泉才從南方走到上海來時，最先就拜訪了這父執曾炳垣。因爲曾敎授　從前在南方的中學校授課時，和海泉的父親同事，丨海泉的父親當校長，他當英文敎　員。　　在未見曾敎授以前，海泉以爲他也一定和自已的父親一　年老。但是見面之後，完全和他的想像相反，曾敎授還是四十未滿的中年人，態度也和他的面貎一樣十分的温厚而和靄，給了海泉一個很好的印象。不過臉色蒼白了一點，在眼眶周圍也有一套黑紫色的　輪，這大槪就是表示他的風塵勞碌和俗慾過多的象　吧。　　海泉初到上海來，人地生疎，關於住居的問題，也遵了父親的命令，提了出來請敎這位父執。　　［住寄宿舍也可以。不過，····如果你願意的說話，就住在這裏吧。我這裏的三樓的　　樓的房子和亭子間都是空着的。］［亭子間冷了點。還是過街樓好。］　　當時只是默默地坐在一邊傍聽着丈夫和這位新來訪的靑年談話的曾夫人，此刻忽然插嘴說了一句。她說了後，微笑着望了望海泉，隨後又向她的丈夫吉珂吉珂地說了一陣的東洋話。海泉早就知道曾敎授的太太是一位東洋女人。但他眞想不到這位東洋太太的中國　說得那樣淸楚。　　他還没有考進大學就行搬進曾敎授　的家中來了。［有什麽不方便　的事，直接吩咐我好了。這家裡的老媽子又懶又不聽話。恐怕你呌她不　。你有什麽事，告訴我好了。］初搬進來，還在房裏整理行李時，曾夫人丨丨由曾敎授的介紹，她名呌鶴子，丨丨笑吟吟地走進來帮他把小鐵床上的被褥疉好了。［對不住，對不住，曾伯姆，眞對不住。］</p>
<p>海泉看見鶴子夫人那樣地慇勤爲他淸理被包，只是紅着臉向她連說對不住。［不要緊，林先生。你覺得奇怪麽？但在我們日本，這是很尋常的事喲。日晒女子不會當少奶奶，只會當下女的。丨丨賤骨頭。］</p>

<p>— 謝六逸</p>
<p>伯　君在上月得了一個男孩，爲了安慰他的夫人，慶祝新的萌牙，約齊幾位親友，開了一次簡　的湯餅宴。我用紅色紙包裏了禮物，並在上而寫了幾個字：［祝未來的戰士長命百歲。］這句話較之習俗沿用的［長命富貴］多了六個字，雖然果　，但非此不能夠表示我的心情，在這個年頭兒養孩子眞不容易，父母的查任姑且不必說，孩子自已的負擔也很重。從母胎分離，就要投進各種環境裏面；還有他的祖宗們所欠的債，都得要這一輩人來償還。倘使不做一個戰士，怎樣能負擔未來的中國人所　負的責任。法國文學家羅曼·羅蘭說；［眞正的勇士，敢於面對慘淡的人生。］現在養出來的孩子，就得求他做一個勇士或者戰　士，因爲人生的慘淡，没有過於帝國主義宰割下的弱小民族的。　伯君自家本是一位戰士，創辦一種週刋，幾於一個人在那裡唱獨脚戲，他的孩子也該是一個未來的戰士罷，所以我祝賀他的孩子。做　只有愈做愈淸凄；什麽銀婚金婚的紀念也是愈紀念愈肉麻。湯餅宴雖然也是宗法社會的傳統習俗，可是不失爲一種［生的喜悦。］總帶着慶祝［新的誕生］的意思。開一次湯餅宴，就是父母對於新生的孩子表示負責；在各方面把自已的孩子養成一個戰士，　孩子爲本身戰，爲社會國家戰。我們盼望一代比一代好。所以新生的孩子値得慶祝。除此而外，湯餅宴也就毫無意義了。</p>

<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>申報在中國的言論界，已經有六十年的歷史，這樣一個歷史很悠久，而且和中國社會的演進，有深切關係的報紙，要是讓牠永遠停滯在充滿着矛盾而又向前進的時代中，實在是很可惜的一件事！近幾天來，黎烈文先生邀我替將要革新的［自由談］寫點稿子；我對於這新生的［自由談］一面在祝福牠向前進展，另一方面也想趁這機會隨便　說幾句話。我覺得一國文化的水準，和民族的生存力，都是很有關係的。中國的五四運動，雖也滋長了一些新文化的萌芽，但因經濟關係的反映，不久就漸漸衰萎下去，加以中間因經過劇烈的摧殘，使得革命過程中的文化，幾乎要走回復古的途徑。近數年以來，似乎發見了突變的現象，但實際上依舊幻着許多不同的輪廓，這的確是中國特有的現象，也是中國的文化運動不能長足進展的原因。在這兒的確給予了靑年們不少徬徨岐路的印象。我不願以純主觀的願望，向這新生的［自由談］有過分的要求，可是我很想儘量貢獻，關於把握着産生中國新文化　命的大衆的題材，更企冀這新生的［自由談］能夠與以同情而保持其平衡的進展！由於同一的出發點，我願意以後的［自由談］能夠順着文化的最高潮，來推動時代之輪！至少我願意我自已所寫的作品，能夠有這樣的努力和收穫。末了，我謹祝［自由談］爲中國的新文化而努力！</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>日人笑我爲［無組織的國家，］又笑我爲［土匪之國，］拿這種口號到處宣傳，的確，我們幾位軍閥們的不長進，到現在時代還要演［鬩牆］的戲，而土匪共黨，還要乘機竊發，我國的弱點，雖不如日人宣傳之甚，但確也有不能粉飾的地方。　　但在這世界政治，經濟，都不能安定的潮流中，任何一國，均不免有同樣性質的事件發生，所差不過程度問題，即如日本而而論，閣潮時起，重要人物之被暗殺者，指不勝數，而共黨盜竊的案件，更是遍地如麻，若照嚴格說來，有組織的國家，而非土匪之國，其國情自應不當如此，我今天且舉一事來證明。</p>
<p>［昨據東京朝日新聞載，出征上海之麻布第三聯隊機關槍隊長野村，由滬返國後，於五月初旬，因被裁撤，本月十八日，潛入巢鴨町刑務所附近牧原家中盜刦，被東京警視廳逮捕，野材曾犯竊盜罪，此次再犯强盜罪惟警視廳認爲出征上海之［皇軍勇士·］加以說諭後，即行釋放。］</p>
<p>此是東京朝日新聞所載的事實，可知所謂文明國的［皇軍勇士］，其人格不過如此，在好人不當兵的原則下，不必再去苛求責備，惟以國家的法律言，我國雖爲無組織的國家，但當滬戰時，有某連兵士，在崑山搶刦，我將領即以軍法處治，絶不姑容，决不因其抗日有功，而任其犯法亂紀，有功固不能不賞，有罪自不能不誅，此是國家大法，凡是法治國的國家，其法律無不如此。</p>

<p>酒精爲無色輕浮液體，在零度時比重等於○·八○六二，有佳快香味，沸點七十八度○，在零下一百三十度○始凝結，故可用以製寒暑表，燃燒之，呈綠色火熖，其氣體與空氣中養氣混合燃之即爆裂。酒精的性質，大慨如上所述，以下再談其製法，聊供讀者一點常識。</p>
<p>這酒精的製法，是以極稀糖液加釀母（Yeast）使之醱酵（Ｆermehntation）發生碳酸酒體丨經過二十四小時以後，把他取出，用低温蒸餾之，即得含多量水之酒精，於是用乾燥石灰投入，吸收其水分，以布濾過，再行低温蒸餾，則得較純酒精，但共純度之極限，還不過是百分之九十八，而且這種製法，是就少量而言。至於欲製多量時，則用大麥以水浸之，待其發芽，到芽長爲麥長四分之三時，平舗數日，然後用低温烘乾，把杵研碎，再加入五榖粉煑沸，則含有之澱粉，就變成葡萄糖，於是用布濾過，使牠放冷，移入醱酵桶中，加釀毋使醱酵，（時日愈長，醱酵愈完全。）經適當時候取出，即爲普通飲料酒，其中含有酒精約百分之十至百分之五十，然後用蒸餾法蒸餾之，在七十八度○以前餾得者爲酒精，七十八度○以後餾得者爲水，而實際蒸餾時，在七十八度○以前，即有少許水分餾過，故所得酒精，不過百分之九十至百分之九十二，如欲再精製之，則加生石灰粉末於酒精中，令吸收大部分水，濾過，復蒸餾之，可得百分九十八之酒精，這就是酒精極品。此種極純酒精之價値，每三四倍於粗製酒精，因其製造損失過多的緣故。製尋常花露水，即可用百分九十至百分九十二之酒精，但須先用骨炭去其臭，方無妨礙。如欲製上等花露水，則必須用較純酒精，所以這兩種價値也就不同了。　　要知道酒精中含水與否，可用下列幾種檢騐方法；</p>
<p>（一）加無水硫酸銅之無色粉末於酒精中，若變藍色，則爲含水之證。</p>
<p>（二）加煤油於酒精中，若含多量水時，則變　濁。</p>
<p>（三）用酒精計檢其比重，可知酒精中含水之多寡。</p>

<p>Washington, London, and Tokyo All Reportedly Seeking Compromise. Nineteen-Nation Special Committee Meets Today. (London) In the British House of Lords Debate on Disarmament and the Sino-Japanese Issue, Secretary of State for War, Viscount Hailsham, Declares that the Manchurian Problem is Under Discussion by the League of Nations. He Opposes Issuing a Separate Declaration, Stating that the Government's Policy is that of the League of Nations, and it Does Not Wish to Adopt a Separate Policy. Governments of all Nations Will Jointly Exert Their Influence to Find a Solution Satisfactory to the League of Nations, Related Countries, and China and Japan. To Suggest that a Separate Advance Declaration Would Benefit the Situation is a Most Erroneous View. We Must Act as a Whole With the League of Nations. Hailsham Subsequently Indicated that Although the Manchurian Situation is Not Satisfactory, All Countries Are Cooperating to Seek a Solution. Although the Current Situation is Concerning, the Government is Not Only Cooperating With Member States of the League of Nations, but Also Has the Closest Cooperation With the United States With Candor and Frankness.

Since the Day Before Yesterday, the Foreign Ministry Headquarters Has Combined News from Geneva, London, Paris, Washington, and Other Places to Discuss Countermeasures. However, According to the Current Situation, Although Representatives of Various Countries May Issue Unrestrained Arguments at the Provisional Assembly, Behind the Scenes, Representatives of Major Countries Will Hold Informal Negotiations, and Consider a Compromise Plan to Delay the Final Resolution in Some Form Until a Certain Period. The Japanese Government Adopts a Tolerant Attitude Toward This, [Even if the Final Resolution is Delayed, Under the Premise of Manchurian Independence, it is Unavoidable]. If the League of Nations General Assembly Passes This Proposal Unanimously, it Will Decide to Recognize It. However, if the League of Nations General Assembly Passes a Proposal Denying Manchurian Independence, it Will Absolutely Oppose Any Proposal. (Domei News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>And Releases Fallacious Arguments to Comfort Small Nations. (Tokyo) A Reuters Reporter Visited Foreign Minister Uchida Today, and Mentioned the Developments in Manchuria After September 18, 1931. Uchida Said that Any Country With a Government Capable of Managing the Entire Territory Need Not Be Alarmed by Its Subsequent Developments. The Foreign Minister's Words Were Clearly Intended to Comfort Small Nations Anxious that the Manchurian Case Would Become a Precedent. The Foreign Minister Continued to Say that the Overall Situation is Completely Unique and Unusual, and is Actually Caused by the Disturbances in China's Internal Situation, and Should be Treated Specially. Since September 18th, Japan's Actions Have All Been Legitimate Self-Defense. Japan Has Solemnly Declared that it Has Not Instigated the Establishment of a "Manchukuo." Japan's Actions Have Not Violated Any International Treaties. The Foreign Minister Was Unwilling to Indicate How a Solution Could be Found to Preserve the Face of Both Sides, Only Saying that the League of Nations' Capabilities and Experienced Politicians Will Fully Understand Japan's Intentions and Recognize that the Policy Adopted by Japan is the Only Fair and Satisfactory Way to Resolve the Dispute. Finally, He Said that Both Sides Now Trust the League of Nations to Resolve the Issue, Which Will Help to Lay the Foundation for World Peace and Trust, But They Must Not Have Preconceived Notions, and Must Take Understanding as an Indestructible Foundation.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Received a Cable from the Delegation Stating that the Special Committee is Scheduled to Meet on the 1st, Asking Meng to Invite Representatives of China and Japan to Attend in the Name of the Chairman. The Committee Will Not Make Any Resolutions, Only Organize the Case Transferred by the Executive Yuan, and Transfer it to the General Assembly on the 6th. Diplomatic Circles Believe that the Special Committee Has the Power to Draft Resolutions for the General Assembly. Our Delegation Cables that the Special Committee is Willing to Listen to the Demands of Both China and Japan Regarding the General Assembly, and Will Not Make a Decision. The United States Will Also Not Send Personnel to Attend, But if the League of Nations Has Other Organizations, the United States Will Definitely Provide Assistance. According to a Geneva Cable, the Signatory Countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, With the United States as the Center, Are Actively Preparing to Organize a Ten-Nation Committee. In Addition to the Signatory Countries of the Nine-Power Treaty as Ex Officio Members, Soviet Russia is Also Invited to Participate to Break the Stalemate of the League of Nations. At the General Assembly of the League of Nations on the 6th, We Will Request that the First Eight Chapters of the Report Be Resolved First to Determine the Facts, Responsibilities, and Compensation Issues. The Resolution of Chapters Nine and Ten May Have to Wait Until Next Year. (30th Special Dispatch) Japan Opposes</p>
<h3 id="e6">US and Russia Participating in Mediation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Various General Assembly Solutions. Japanese Cable Transmits Foreign Ministry Attitude (Tokyo) Before the League of Nations Assembly, Major and Minor Nations Are Actively Promoting Strategies. According to Cables Received by the Foreign Ministry, the Private Solutions Being Considered Are as Follows: (1) After Discussions Among the Minor Nations at the League of Nations Provisional Assembly, a Resolution Based on the Stimson Doctrine Not Recognizing "Manchukuo" Would Be Proposed and Established Despite the Opposition of the Japanese Representatives. (2) The Nineteen-Nation Committee Would Serve as a Continuing Body of the Provisional Assembly, Establishing a Mediation Committee Including Representatives of the United States and Russia, and Entrusting It to Draft a Sino-Japanese Reconciliation Plan. (3) The Committee Would Hold Its First Session on January 10 and Draft a Committee Report Within Two Months to Present to China and Japan. (4) If Japan Does Not Approve the Mediation Plan, It Would Submit Its Intent to the Assembly, and After the Assembly Confirms the Mediation Plan, It Would Draft a Recommendation to Japan Based on Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. The Period for Reconciliation Procedures is Set at Two Months to Await Roosevelt's Inauguration as President of the United States in Early March, So as to Increase the League of Nations' Pressure on Japan. This is in Accordance With China's Demands, Hence the Rumor that the Mediation Committee Promised that Russia Would Also Join Informally. However, the Foreign Ministry Expressed the Following Strong Opposition to This: (1) A Nineteen-Nation Committee Without Representatives from China and Japan Reviewing the Sino-Japanese Dispute Actually Goes Against the Purpose of the League of Nations. Even Including Representatives from China and Japan, the Principle of Rejecting the Participation of Third Countries is Absolutely Opposed. (2) The Manchurian Problem Was Entrusted to the League of Nations, and to Actually Entrust It to a Mediation Committee Including the United States and Russia is Tantamount to Exposing the League of Nations' Own Incompetence. (3) If the Minor Nations' Strategies Succeed and a Resolution of Non-Recognition is Proposed, the Imperial Government Will Cast a Veto and Have No Choice But to Withdraw from the League of Nations.

<h3 id="e7">Discusses Sino-Japanese Problem <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>British Government Is Using All Its Efforts to Mediate and Seek a Solution Satisfactory to All Parties (London) Lord Cecil Raised the Issues of Disarmament and the Sino-Japanese Dispute in the House of Lords Tonight, Asking the Government to Provide Explanations on These Two Matters. Cecil Said that He Very Much Agreed With the Japanese Government's Statement That Japan Supports the League of Nations. If Japan Truly Wishes to Support It, Then the Seriousness of the Situation Can Be Changed. The Current Problem is Whether Both Sides Will Accept the Proposals of the Lytton Report as the Basis for a Solution. Japan Has Previously Recognized the Appointment of the Investigation Team and Its Scope of Duties, so the British Government Should Do Its Best to Support the Investigation Team. Cecil Continued to Talk About Disarmament, Saying that the Current Situation is More Hopeful Than Before. He Approved of the Principles on Which the British Government's Proposals Were Based. As for Churchill's Policy of Amending the Land Provisions in the Treaty of Versailles, It Would Lead to Disaster. Cecil Criticized the Meeting Procedures in Geneva, Advocating Open Discussions. Opposition Leader Ponsonby Said that He Did Not Expect the Government to Make Any Statements on the Sino-Japanese Problem at This Time. He Expressed Dissatisfaction With the British Government's Disarmament Proposals, Believing That They Allow Germany to Reintroduce Compulsory Conscription. He and Cecil Both Advocated Open Meetings in Geneva.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Lord Reading Praises the Lytton Report <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Liberal Lord Reading Praised the Importance of the Lytton Report's Recommendations and the Fairness of the Investigation Team's Work, Saying that Its Recommendations Have Been Approved by the General Public. This Does Not Mean that All the Recommendations Should Be Accepted, but Unless There Are Extremely Powerful Reasons and Facts to Prove Otherwise, None of the Recommendations Can Be Ignored. He Also Approved of the Government's Disarmament Proposals on the Issue of Disarmament, but He Doubted Whether the Proposal to Reduce the Air Force Would Be Accepted or Effective. The British Proposal Did Not Have a Method of Limiting Disarmament in the Budget, Which is Quite Regrettable. He Advised the Government to Devote Itself to This, as This is an Effective Way to Reduce Disarmament, and Can Consolidate Britain's Position in Discussions on War Debts With the United States. Lord Lothian Said that the Great Powers Should Work Together to Help China Organize a Modern and Efficient Government. He Also Said that the Issue of Revising the Treaty Should Be Discussed in the Disarmament Conference, So That a Solution to Eastern Europe Can Be Found Based on Agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Secretary of State for War States Government Attitude <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Secretary of State for War Hailsham Replied That the British Government Is Using Its Full Efforts to Seek a Method That Can Satisfy the League of Nations and Those With Extremely Close Ties to the Far Eastern Problem to Resolve the Sino-Japanese Dispute. As for the Disarmament Problem, the Government Intends to Use the Policy of Limiting the Budget Together. The Government Believes That It Is Best to Exchange Views Informally on Difficult Problems Before Openly Discussing Them, and to Temporarily Minimize Open Discussions. The Government Has Been Actively Talking With Major Naval Countries in the Past Few Weeks to Implement the Resolutions Passed by the General Assembly in July, But It Has Not Yet Reached the Point Where It Can Issue a Concrete Report.

<p>National Government Officially Orders Return to Nanjing</p>
<p>Responding to the Demands of the Situation, Carefully Selecting the Location to Obtain Comprehensive Information. Shen Zhengyi at the Altar Will Still Quickly Rise Up to Pursue the Grand Plan of Construction in the Auxiliary Capital and Provisional Capital. The Central Government Is Scheduled to Hold the Inauguration Ceremony in Nanjing Today. Chairman Lin's Special Train Passed Through Xuzhou Last Night and Headed South. (Nanjing) The National Government Ordered on the 29th, "The Government's Relocation to Luoyang Provisional Capital Has Been Ten Months Ago. We Have Been Tasting Gall and Sleeping on Brushwood, Working Diligently Day and Night. We Have Never Slacked Off in Our Plans to Resist Aggression and Seek National Strength. However, the Central Government is Where Government Orders Originate, and It is Also Where the People Entrust Their Lives. It is Valuable to Be Able to Respond to the Demands of the Situation and Carefully Select the Location. Previously, Japan Violated the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, and Exercised Its Violence to First Occupy the Northeast and Then Attack Shanghai. Nanjing, the Capital, Was Threatened by It, So We Moved to Luoyi to Establish the Foundation of the Nation. Restoring Internal Order and Repelling Foreign Aggression Should Be Decided in Order of Priority. Therefore, We Convened the National Crisis Conference in Luoyang to Vigorously Plan and Maintain the Three Affairs of Resisting Aggression, Pacifying Bandits, and Rescuing Disasters, and to Supervise the Military Commission to Dispatch Large Armies to Various Provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian to Wipe Out Bandit Troubles and Comfort the Disaster Victims. All That Has Been Done to Calm the Local Areas and Support the Difficult and Dangerous Situations Should Already Be Seen by the People of the Whole Country. Now, the Bandit Atmosphere in Various Provinces is Gradually Being Suppressed. The League of Nations Conference is About to Open. The Liaoshen Incident Has Long Been the Focus of Attention of Various Countries in the World, and It Also Concerns the Rise and Fall, Survival and Extinction of Our Nation and People. Diplomatic Negotiations Can Swiftly Respond to the Situation. The Capital's Transportation is Convenient, and International Interactions Are More Suitable. Therefore, It is Decided to Move Back to Nanjing on December 1 to Obtain Comprehensive Information and Express Justice at the Altar. Externally, We Use the Spirit of Complying With International Treaties to Move and Influence Neighboring Countries, and Internally, We Announce to Our Compatriots the Strategy of Sustained Long-Term Resistance. We Also Take Advantage of This Relocation to Further Promote to the People the Meaning of Restoring the Central Plains. If a Nation Exists on the Earth, It Must Have Something to Stand On. Without Planning Construction, There is No Way to Seek Survival. Without Strengthening National Defense, There is No Way to Resist Aggression. The Civilization of Luoyang in Previous Dynasties Has Gradually Become a Thing of the Past, and the People's Customs Are Simple and Frugal, and the Products Are Abundant. It Is Actually the Same as the Auxiliary Capital Xi'an, Both Being Lands of Abundance. However, Due to Economic Difficulties and Low Cultural Levels, Natural Wealth and Resources Have Not Been Developed. Although the Government is Returning to the Capital in the East This Time to Adapt to the Environment, It Will Still Quickly Rise Up to Pursue the Grand Plan of Construction in the Auxiliary Capital and Provisional Capital, and Establish the Foundation of National Defense. However, When the Business Is Just Beginning, Everything Needs to Be Managed. It Is Hoped That Contemporary Talents and Overseas Chinese Will Actively Contribute Money and Do Their Best Together. As for Protecting Public Security and Maintaining Enterprises, It Is the Responsibility of the Authorities to Strictly Supervise and Not Neglect Their Duties. If We Can Truly Have a Way of Nurturing and Educating the People, How Can We Fear Foreign Troubles? Reversing Decline and Rising Up Can Be Hoped For Here. May All Our Compatriots Understand This Order." (30th Special Dispatch) (Xuzhou) News From the Road, Chairman Lin's Special Train Drove East From Luoyang at 2:00 AM on the 30th, and Will Arrive in Xuzhou Tonight to Transfer to the Capital.

<p>The Situation in the Far East Is Becoming Increasingly Serious</p>
<h3 id="e16">Necessity for the United States to Increase Military Strength <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>General MacArthur Suggests to the President That International Treaties Are Insufficient to Guarantee Peace (Washington) U.S. Army Chief of Staff General MacArthur today suggested that the army's strength should be increased by 40 percent, citing public concern about the situation in the Far East. MacArthur's recommendation was made in his annual report to Secretary of War Hurley, who will forward it to President Hoover, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy. At a time when calls for military reduction are prevalent, the Army Chief of Staff's sudden suggestion to increase troops is indeed unexpected. Even those within the government have expressed surprise. Consequently, several individuals quickly stated that the report and suggestion only represent MacArthur's personal opinion. However, according to custom, high-ranking military officers are required to inform the Commander-in-Chief before presenting suggestions in reports. Moreover, MacArthur is not known for being talkative in the military. Therefore, the news has already sparked discussion. The suggestion made today is not only clear in its wording but also concise and precise, proposing to increase the number of soldiers from 118,000 to 165,000 and the number of officers from 12,000 to 14,000. Once the U.S. has the financial means to secure the necessary funds, Congress should approve its implementation. MacArthur explained the reasons for increasing troops in his suggestion, believing that the tense situation in the Far East further proves that international treaties are not a sufficient guarantee of international peace. In addition, the Sino-Japanese dispute has the potential to escalate into a broader disaster, causing some Americans to deeply worry about the adequacy of the national defense organization and feel the necessity to increase its strength. According to sources close to military circles, there are many who believe that the issue of national defense and its relationship with the Sino-Japanese dispute should be kept concealed as much as possible. However, General MacArthur believes that it should be brought up for open and frank discussion, hence the publication of this suggestion. Now that MacArthur has made this suggestion, it is anticipated that the U.S. Congress will not only discuss the situation in the Far East and the Manchurian issue in both the Senate and the House of Representatives but will also consider it in committees, as the committees must discuss and vote on various suggestions before passing the budget. It is noted that General MacArthur has served in the Philippines three times and also served as a military attaché in Japan from 1905 to 1906, familiar with the situation in the Far East and its military issues.

<p>(Washington) In an effort to economize, the U.S. government is planning to significantly reduce the number of Marine Corps personnel and close several domestic posts. However, Marine Corps personnel assigned to warships and stationed abroad will not be reduced. The Marines stationed in China will also not be reduced. The Marine Corps authorities, in light of Congress's talk of cutting various expenses, are taking the initiative to make reductions. They have already drafted a detailed plan, which will be submitted to the Budget Committee next week. It is reported that the first post to be closed will be the Parris Island post. In addition, the Mare Island, Quantico, and San Diego posts will also see significant troop reductions. Marine Corps authorities have discussed with the Congressional Budget Committee several times, and this reduction plan is the result of these discussions. It is reported that the next fiscal year's budget will stipulate that the number of Marine Corps personnel will be only slightly more than 13,600. (Twenty-ninth National News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Fishery Products Temporarily Exempt from Taxation, Maritime Protection Fee Set at Two Percent of Value (Nanjing) The Executive Yuan passed the Ministry of Industry's drafted measures for reorganizing the fishing industry. Taxes on fishery products will be temporarily suspended, and a maritime protection fee will be levied at two percent of the value of fishery products, generating an estimated annual revenue of 800,000, based on the principle of "taking from the fisheries to benefit the fisheries." The tax will be collected by fish merchants when they purchase fishery products, without the establishment of separate agencies. All other miscellaneous taxes will be abolished. Regarding the protection of fishing vessels, in addition to the four existing patrol ships, six more patrol ships will be added. To ensure the safety of fishing vessels and maintain the livelihoods of fishermen, five simple weather stations will be built first, and several fishermen's loan offices will be established.

<p>Hope for the League of Nations (Beiping) Wu Peifu said that Japan is humiliating and invading us with force, and we hope that the League of Nations will exert real influence. It is essential to (1) impose a joint economic embargo on Japan by all nations, and (2) use the League of Nations' military force to restrain Japan. It is also hoped that the government will thoroughly understand that there are three key points to resolving the Sino-Japanese issue: First, China must unite the entire nation and prepare for armed resistance; second, the Sino-Japanese issue can never be resolved if even an inch of sovereignty in the Northeast is not returned; and third, all internal conflicts in our country, except for genuine and confirmed Communist issues, should be resolved for the sake of external defense. I often advise people with the four words "secure internal stability and resist external aggression," which is what I mean. I have never been affiliated with any party, and today I am even more unwilling to have party strife. Britain has changed its party cabinet into a nationally unified government, and Japan does not base its government on a single party or faction either. Generally speaking, a country cannot cope with foreign issues without concentrating the strength of the entire nation. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

The Chongqing army continues to advance towards Renjian, with only minor contact with the provincial army. Deng and Tian will temporarily not join the vortex. Various parties recommend Tian Songyao to preside over provincial affairs in the aftermath of the Sichuan situation, and the remaining matters will be handled by the central government. Tian is willing to enter Shaanxi to suppress bandits and recommends Zhang Qun to serve as chairman, expressing clearly that he is willing to use his forces to sincerely support him. The generals also support this proposal. Zhang stated in a letter on the 30th to a certain Sichuan person in Hankou that he does not want to hold a fixed position. It is expected that Zhang will go to Sichuan to form a reorganization committee, with Zhang serving as the chairman, to implement the proposals telegraphed on the 29th. (30th Special Dispatch) (Nanjing) Dai Jitao said that he hopes that all parties will abandon military policies and emphasize moral concepts in the Sichuan situation, and that by expanding the two characters of morality into the foundation for peace and saving Sichuan, all disputes can be eliminated. Sichuan's public opinion is being hijacked by warlords, making it difficult for them to express their true feelings to the central government. It is hoped that the national public opinion circles can create true public opinion on the Sichuan situation and severely sanction it with the central force of public opinion, so that all parties will be aware and vigilant. He will send a telegram to the Sichuan generals in his personal name to respect the prestige of the central government and abide by the 17-year decree governing Sichuan, striving to implement it and stating that local disputes should be resolved locally or resolved by the power of the central government. It is impossible for the central government to send people to mediate.

He visited the American and French envoys, recounting that over 200,000 Chinese laborers participated in the European War, with deaths and disappearances exceeding 60,000. The Nine-Power Treaty, bought with their blood, has now been utterly destroyed by Japan. France is a direct aid provider, and the United States is the leader of the Nine-Power Treaty.

<p>〓Reply to the US Note Ready for Dispatch〓</p>
<p>Content States Reasons for Requesting Deferment to Maintain World Trust, Indicates Readiness to Pay in Cash if the US Insists on Debt Repayment at Maturity ▲Havas, London, 29th - The British government's response to the American note seems to be completely drafted. Tonight, Prime Minister MacDonald had an audience with the King for over an hour to discuss the British debt issue. Political figures generally believe that this reply is one of the most important documents Britain has sent to a foreign country in many years. In terms of its content, the reply not only explains Britain's financial position but also carries extremely important political significance, as seen in the Prime Minister's special audience with the King for this matter. ▲National News Agency, London, 30th - It is reported that after the British government convened a cabinet meeting to discuss war debts, it decided that if the United States insists on payment of the installment due on December 15, Britain is prepared to pay it. According to the Daily Mail, the Bank of England has already followed the Ministry of Finance's order to arrange the transfer of 30 million pounds to New York to prepare for debt repayment. The first batch of 3 million pounds is scheduled to depart today, with the remainder to be shipped in batches. The British government's reply to the US State Department is expected to be sent out today. The content will state that if the United States insists on payment, Britain will comply without delay. However, it will also state in the strongest terms that the British government firmly believes that a deferment is necessary to maintain world confidence. Furthermore, it will solemnly state other payment methods, hoping that by demonstrating the British government's ability to pay and explaining the strong reasons for the need for deferment, it can convince the United States that the installment does not necessarily need to be paid on schedule. Additionally, it is reported that the reply will hint that a deferment would have a more stabilizing effect on the economy than paying on schedule.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 29th - British cabinet members are still intently drafting the reply to the United States regarding war debts. MacDonald, Baldwin, Chamberlain, Simon, Hore-Belisha, and others all met today on Downing Street. The British Ambassador to France, Lord Tyrrell, returned to London last night and met with the Prime Minister for 45 minutes before also going to the Foreign Office to deliberate. It is expected that the draft reply can be submitted to the weekly cabinet meeting tomorrow. The entire issue of war debt deferment hinges on whether the reasons given in the reply are sufficient and how these reasons are presented. Therefore, the careful consideration of the draft reply is taking considerable time and effort. In the afternoon, the Prime Minister had an audience with the King, reportedly discussing the war debt issue. Tonight, the cabinet met in the House of Commons for a short period, also in connection with the reply to the United States. They will meet again tomorrow morning. It is expected that this reply, while limited to stating reasons for reconsidering the war debts and deferring the December installment, must provide detailed reasons and support them with accurate and irrefutable facts. The reply will mention the impact of the Lausanne reparations agreement to demonstrate that Britain may not be able to continue paying US debts when European countries are not repaying their debts to Britain. Britain has already paid more to the United States than it has received from its debtor nations by 200 million pounds. If comparing the original debt figures, other countries owe Britain more than Britain owes the United States.</p>

<p>▲Havas, London, 30th - The Times financial section states that 3 million pounds in cash is being shipped to the United States today. After considering various assumptions, the newspaper concludes that this cash export is being carried out by the British Treasury. The newspaper also reports that rumors suggest the cash export will amount to as much as 20 million pounds. Downing Street announced today that this cash export is being done on behalf of a certain government and has no relation to the US war debt installment due on December 15.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 29th - The French reply to the United States regarding war debts will be purely argumentative, refuting the reasons held by the United States with logical arguments. The Paris Times quoted the words of the renowned economist Romier, saying that the only way to move the United States today is to make them realize that if they insist on a harsh resolution of the debt dispute, this dispute will be the last and most worthless event in the great disruption of the world economy.</p>

The London-New York exchange rate opened at $3.15125 yesterday afternoon, but today it has risen to $3.2025 at the same time. However, the price of gold continues to soar, having risen for five consecutive days, reaching a new high of 130 shillings and 8 pence per ounce today.</p>

<p>Hitler Rushes to Berlin to Discuss a Political Truce with Schleicher, The Success or Failure of Schleicher's Cabinet Hinges on This Move ▲Reuters, Berlin, 29th - General Schleicher is still seeking the opinions of various party leaders to determine whether they support his formation of a new cabinet. Schleicher will meet with Nazi leader Hitler, intending to persuade Hitler to at least be patient with a cabinet led by the General as Prime Minister. It is expected that this move will be ineffective. If so, General Schleicher will abandon his efforts to make a political truce with the parties, and the current Prime Minister Papen will continue to govern amidst opposition from all sides. According to socialist newspapers, the news of Papen's re-appointment as Prime Minister has angered major factories in Berlin. If President Hindenburg re-appoints Papen, it would be tantamount to declaring war on the German people and the constitution. It is now expected that the President will make a final decision on Thursday, using whatever means he deems appropriate to ensure the political and economic stability of Germany this winter. In other words, Germany will be placed under a military dictatorship. ▲National News Agency, Berlin, 30th - Hitler arrived in Berlin from Munich today. After getting off the train in Weimar and consulting with advisors, he immediately traveled by car, rushing to Berlin. It is expected that he will arrive in Berlin this afternoon to meet with General Schleicher. The entire nation is watching today's negotiations, hoping that the current critical political situation may find a turnaround.</p>

As a result of the meeting, it is now known that Premier Herriot is scheduled to travel to Geneva on Thursday or Friday evening to participate in talks among representatives of the five major powers – Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Germany – to prepare for the resumption of the disarmament conference. However, if an accident occurs that makes it inconvenient for the Premier to depart, the departure date will still need to be changed.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 29th - British Secretary of State for War Hailsham said in the House of Lords today in response to an inquiry about whether Germany can join the disarmament conference, that Foreign Secretary Simon has been working hard since returning from Geneva, hoping to get Germany back into the disarmament conference. As a result, it is now reasonably expected that Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and the United States will hold informal talks in a few days to find a way for Germany to participate in the disarmament conference. The five-power talks mentioned by Hailsham will be held in Geneva on December 2. The British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary will depart for Geneva around December 1 to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>After initiating the monthly donation campaign to relieve Northeastern refugees and aid the Northeastern volunteer armies, some are now shouting the slogan of "General Mobilization for National Salvation Through Entertainment" and launching a charity performance for Northeastern refugees. While this may be one way to save the nation, further thought makes this phenomenon truly disheartening. The cry for "National Salvation" didn't start today. Around the time of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, nearly every citizen of the Republic of China wept and cried out in anguish, with mouths speaking of "National Salvation" and pens writing about "National Salvation." The calls for "Recovering Lost Territory by Force" and "Long-Term Resistance" were even more persistent. However, now, just one year later, even these empty cries have faded and disappeared with the passing of time. What is starkly presented before our eyes is the fact that a puppet regime has been established outside the customs, the Zhabei-Wusong area has become a painful picture of shattered tiles and ruined walls, and there are also the tragic bloody footprints of the Northeastern volunteer armies' arduous struggle and the sorrowful cries of the Northeastern refugees who have become slaves before death. The cold wind has risen, and winter has arrived. All the "masters," "madams," "young masters," and "modern ladies" have already put on warm winter clothes and prepared luxurious furs, electric heaters, champagne, and the like, waiting for the "auspicious snow" to arrive so they can leisurely enjoy the pleasure of "warming wine around the stove" or "visiting plum blossoms in the snow." But what about the Northeastern volunteer armies? Under the early cold of the icy and snowy wilderness, they only have thin clothes dancing in the north wind, only cold iron, only arduous and tragic hunger, only heroic struggle, only blood scattered across the white mountains and black waters, and great sacrifices. In comparison, we cannot but admit that the bodies of the "masters," "madams," "young masters," and "ladies" are too warm, while the Northeastern volunteer armies are too cold. Conversely, we cannot but admit that the hearts of the "masters," "madams," "young masters," and "ladies" are too cold, while every member of the Northeastern volunteer armies has a heart filled with heat. What are the Northeastern volunteer armies fighting arduously for? What are the Northeastern refugees wandering around for? It is for the survival of our nation, for resisting violence, and for upholding justice and righteousness. Then, is their freezing and hunger justified? Conversely, is our warmth, fullness, and enjoyment justified? If not, then what should we do? Here, each of us should bury our heads in contemplation, assuming that we have not yet become insensitive wood or stone. From "shouting for recovering lost territory by force" to "silent and soundless," from "silent and soundless" to "National Salvation Through Entertainment," is this comical or tragic? Look at how the invading countries do what they say, achieving what they set out to do, without empty slogans or pointless tears. Even when society and the economy are declining and collapsing, their people still enthusiastically donate to the country for the sake of aggression. What about us? Shouldn't we be even more willing to contribute our strength if we have strength and donate money if we have money, for the sake of self-defense and for the sake of fighting for the survival of our nation? Now, let us change the slogan of "recovering lost territory by force" to "National Salvation Through Entertainment" and let everyone have a bitter smile through tears. But young masters and ladies, this time, I hope you are also enthusiastic and active. Because whether it is a tearful smile or a joyful smile, you will have completed the task of "National Salvation Through Entertainment," and the Northeastern refugees and volunteer armies will also receive your great gift. Now, let us shout for "National Salvation Through Entertainment!" Young masters and ladies, are you willing to come and appreciate this entertainment filled with blood and tears for "National Salvation?"</p>

<h3 id="e62">Non-Aggression Treaty Established <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 29th - The Franco-Russian non-aggression treaty was signed today at the French Foreign Ministry by French Premier Herriot and Russian Ambassador to France Dovgalevsky. The French Premier then spoke, saying that he extended his respects to the Soviet Russian people and that France was willing to enhance mutual trust with them. With the establishment of this treaty, the system of non-aggression pacts is now complete and should help consolidate peace. The Russian Ambassador replied that the Soviet Union attached great importance to the political and moral value of this treaty, which has proven France and Russia's desire for peace.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 29th - The French Foreign Ministry announced that the French government and Russia have concluded a mutual non-aggression treaty. What should be stated at the time of signing is that no clause of the treaty restricts the content of future Russo-French economic agreements or the French government's complete freedom regarding tariffs. Treaty Full text of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between France and the Soviet Union The full text is as follows: The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the President of the French Republic, in order to consolidate peace, promote friendship between the two sides, and demonstrate the peaceful intentions extended by the Anti-War Pact of August 27, 1928, in the spirit of fulfilling past international responsibilities, have concluded the following agreement: [Article 1] Neither party shall, alone or in conjunction with another country, attack the other party from the sea, land, or air, and shall respect the sovereignty of the other party's territory and possessions. [Article 2] If either party is attacked by another country or countries, the other party shall not provide direct or indirect assistance to the attackers. If one party actively attacks a third country, the other party may terminate the present treaty with notice. [Article 3] The above two articles do not overturn or change the rights acquired by both parties in the various treaties concluded before this treaty, but both parties simultaneously declare that they are not bound by any provision in any previous treaty that requires participation in an attack by a third party. [Article 4] Neither party may participate in any international agreement that restricts the other party's trade and financing, or any measures that prevent the other party's foreign trade. [Article 5] Both parties shall respect the sovereignty of the other party's territory and possessions in accordance with the first article of the agreement, and shall not interfere in the other party's internal affairs, specifically, shall not engage in any direct actions, instigating or encouraging any disturbances, propaganda, or attempts to interfere, in order to undermine the other party's territorial integrity, or to change the other party's political and social system in whole or in part by force. Both parties shall also not initiate, support, supply, subsidize, or permit military organizations in their respective countries to attack the other party's territory or overthrow the other party's government by force. [Article 6] Stipulates that all conflicts and disputes between the two parties should be resolved by peaceful means, as pointed out in the simultaneously concluded mediation agreement. [Article 7] Stipulates that the French and Russian texts of the agreement are equally valid, and the agreement shall take effect only after the exchange of ratification documents in Moscow. The agreement may not be terminated within two years after its implementation. Thereafter, if either party wishes to terminate the agreement, it must notify the other party one year in advance.</p>
<p>Attached Mediation Agreement The Franco-Russian Mediation Agreement has eight articles. Its content stipulates that from the effective date of the agreement, any dispute between the two parties that cannot be resolved through diplomatic means must be submitted to a mediation committee. The committee shall be composed of two representatives appointed by each of the two governments, and its chairman must be a national of the country where the meeting is held. Experts may also be hired to participate in the committee in a consultative capacity, and witnesses may also participate when necessary. The committee members shall convene once a year, but both parties may agree to postpone it to the following year. In case of urgent need, a temporary meeting may be requested. Fifteen days before the meeting, both parties must submit a list of the issues to be discussed through diplomatic procedures. The meeting time is limited to fifteen days, but it can be extended with the consent of both parties. The meeting address shall alternate between Paris and Moscow. In addition, it is stipulated that the committee meeting is only valid if all members of both parties are present, and the resolution must be passed unanimously. If a unanimous vote cannot be obtained, either party may request a special meeting within four months of the closing of the meeting to resolve the matter. Both parties must respond within three months as to whether or not they approve of the committee's proposals regarding mediation procedures. Finally, the effective period of the agreement is the same as that of the non-aggression treaty listed above. (TASS dispatch)</p>

<p>Adding 500 Armed Police to Guard Against Korean Independence Party Crossing the Border ▲Hualian News Agency, Seoul, 3rd - Since September 18th, the Korean Government-General has seen an increase in the activity of the Korean Independence Party and the Korean Communist Party, frequently disrupting the passage of military trains. In the past year, as many as 40 secret organizations have been uncovered. Japanese troops and police are finding it very difficult. Therefore, it has been decided to increase the border defense wire network by 600,000 yen starting next spring, dig trenches for defense in key areas along the border, and deploy more than 500 armed police teams to prevent the Korean Independence Army from crossing the border. It is reported that this plan has been approved by the Colonial Affairs Ministry and will be implemented soon. According to reports, Korean farmers' lives are becoming increasingly impoverished, and with the oppression of Japanese imperialism worsening, the number of people automatically participating in the revolutionary movement is increasing daily, leaving the proponents of militarism powerless.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Warsaw, 29th - An anti-Jewish wave suddenly broke out in Lviv, Poland today. The initial cause was that a Jewish student killed a Polish student in a fight. Polish students were greatly angered, and many civilians expressed sympathy for the Polish student, so they held demonstrations in the streets. The windows of shops set up by Jews were destroyed, and Jews walking on the road were beaten, even women were not spared. When the police heard the news, they rushed to the scene, and more than eighty people on both sides were injured. The current government authorities strictly prohibit the dissemination of news about the riots, and four newspapers have been suspended indefinitely for publishing the news. The Polish capital has obviously been affected by this wave, because Polish students at the University of Warsaw intend to expel Jewish students from the school, and the president has temporarily closed the school to prevent the spread of the wave.</p>

<p>The Capital is Surrounded ▲National News Agency, Tegucigalpa, Honduras, 29th - The Honduran capital is completely besieged by the rebels today. The rebel leader Fonseca has sent a letter of ultimatum to President Colindres, demanding surrender. The President replied with "Take it yourself" and ordered the government troops to do their best to defend, not to take the offensive, which would only weaken the defensive strength. Because the capital is extremely dangerous, it is expected that the defenders can hold out for some time. Russian Officialdom Denies</p>

<p>Investigating the Origin of the Rumors ▲National News Agency, Moscow, 29th - After hearing the rumors outside that Zinoviev had died, the Soviet Russian government is thoroughly investigating the origin of this rumor and issued a formal denial in the evening, accompanied by a statement from the director of the Kalinin Hospital, claiming that Mr. Qi had been admitted to the hospital a month ago and was discharged a few days ago after recovering from his illness and is currently healthy and well. According to reports, the news of Zinoviev's death was first spread by the London Exchange Telegraph Company today, followed by a formal announcement by the Berlin Russian Embassy, which led to its widespread dissemination around the world. When the Soviet Russian government heard the news, TASS issued a denial a few hours later, and the Russian authorities immediately began investigating the source of the rumors.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Washington D.C., 29th - The leaders of the American starvation marchers arrived in Washington D.C. today, requesting permission for the marchers to enter the city and provide accommodation and food for the first three days of next week. The Commissioners of the District of Columbia, in view of the previous experience with the veterans' marchers, have refused their request, believing that providing accommodation and food at this time may not be difficult, but it will be very difficult to get them to leave in the future. It is better not to allow them to enter the country in the first place. However, at this time, the starvation marchers have already approached the capital. Even if more police are dispatched to prevent them from entering the city, they will pretend to be civilians and sneak in, unless martial law is declared and armed teams are sent to inspect pedestrians entering the city on each street, it will not be possible to prevent them. Therefore, although the Commissioners of the District of Columbia have refused their request, federal officials are still very hesitant about how to deal with this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Japanese Budget Contradictions - Japanese Dispatch <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Even if the whole country turns to scorched earth, we must persist in our claims to Manchuria...] This is Japan amidst tense international relations. One aspect of its foreign policy reveals Japan's true intentions more openly, and we can also see where all its conspiracies lie.</p>
<p>Originally, after the assassination of Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai on May 15th of this year, parliamentary politics in Japan were fundamentally shaken. The liberalism advocated by the two major opposing parties was not only powerless but also declining. To put it more bluntly, militarism was on the rise, virtually overriding the appointed constitution. However, they could still explain that Japan's constitutional politics were not democratic but monarchical, and that the cabinet was not entirely responsible to the parliament but to the Emperor. The cabinet of Prime Minister Saitō Makoto was called a "cooperative cabinet." At the beginning of its formation, it originally intended to bring together various factions, at least the outstanding members of the two major parties, the Seiyūkai and the Minseitō, to serve as cabinet members, forming a so-called "cabinet of talent." However, in reality, most Japanese people considered this only a cabinet of second-rate talent. Nevertheless, with a few ministers and vice-ministers from both the Seiyūkai and Minseitō as political officials, the cabinet from the beginning included the army, navy, and two not-very-harmonious political parties merged together. They themselves called it a "cooperative cabinet," but in reality, it was a mixed cabinet. In the Saitō cabinet, there was the Japanese-style fascist tendency of the military, the landlords and Mitsui affiliated members of the Seiyūkai, and the liberalism and Mitsubishi affiliated members of the Minseitō. Within the military, there was also competition between the army and navy, and within the army, there was a distinction between gradualists and radicals. Therefore, the Saitō cabinet was in a state of uncertainty from the beginning. From June to now, it has been half a year, and the Saitō cabinet is considered long-lived. Its biggest difficulty at present is that when the budget was being drafted, the so-called "national defense enhancement," "military equipment improvement," "Manchurian Incident" expenses, "situation relief" funds, plus the new demands of various ministries and agencies, had already exceeded 1.4 billion yen. If all were approved, plus all the regular expenses, then the total budget for the next year would be 3 billion yen, while the total revenue would be at most 1.286 billion yen. Given the current state of the national economy, how could it bear this burden? Moreover, when will the Manchurian problem be resolved? How long will the [Manchurian Incident expenses] continue, and when will it come to an end? No one can predict. This means that before Japan earns any money, it will have to subsidize at least 132 million yen in military expenses every year. After a modification, the army and finance ministries caused countless troubles, almost causing the cabinet to collapse. After much mediation, a special increase of 95 million yen was given to the military, temporarily patching up the current rift. The 1933 budget, totaling 2.238 billion yen in expenditure, is the largest budget in Japan's history. The average burden per person is 31 yen. Such a huge budget is considered by financial and political circles in Japan to be a crisis that could lead Japan's finances to bankruptcy. However, the military authorities argue that this is an emergency and that such a huge budget is necessary. This budget has two unprecedented features: first, the deficit is entirely filled by public bonds; second, the military expenditure has increased enormously. In the 1933 Japanese budget, the national treasury's regular revenue is only 1.288 billion yen, and even with temporary revenue, it is only 1.341 billion yen. The difference is still 900 million yen, and there is no other way to increase revenue to fill the gap. Therefore, the public bonds currently planned to be issued, such as the Manchurian Incident expenses, civil engineering projects, telephone projects, earthquake relief bonds, military improvement expenses, etc., all new budgets, must be filled by public bonds. The number of issued bonds must be at least 896 million yen, accounting for 40% of the total expenditure. However, among its regular national tax revenue, tax revenue is 691 million yen, state property revenue is 457 million yen, and stamp tax revenue is 67 million yen. Compared with the tax revenue three or four years ago, it has decreased from over 900 million to 690 million yen (the decline in tax revenue shows the general pain of the Japanese situation). Comparing tax revenue with expenditure, it is only 30% of the total, even less than one-tenth of the public bonds. The rapid increase in military expenditure is also the current cancer of the Japanese budget. Especially in the last two years, it has increased rapidly and significantly. According to its military, the explanation is due to the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident. The army and navy together total 820 million yen. Even if all the tax revenue is used for military expenses, it is still 130 million yen short. Comparing military expenditure with total expenditure, it actually accounts for 36%. It is strongly remembered that between 1919 and 1922, Japanese military expenditure accounted for 42% to 49% of the total expenditure. At that time, it was appropriate after the European War and during the military period of the Siberian Expedition, so military expenditure increased extraordinarily. However, at that time, Japan made a fortune of over 10 billion during the war, and the national economic power was indeed much stronger than it is now. The total budget expenditure was only 1.6 billion. From 1930, military expenditure began to decrease (at that time, preparations were being made to restore the gold standard), but it increased sharply last year, from 27% the previous year to 35%, and it will strongly increase to 36% next year. This does not include temporary expenses such as troop increases in the Northeast. Although it is less than the 80% of military expenditure during the Russo-Japanese War, it is still a kind of budget that must be increased during the final account. Although it has been roughly determined on the surface, the Seiyūkai's Mitsuchi Tetsuzo and the Minseitō's Yamamoto, the Home Minister, are in a period of fierce fighting, from secret struggles to open brawls, for the civil engineering construction plan. The details will be reported later. (Tokyo, November 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">British Liberal and Labour Parties Declare Opposition to Japan <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ Advocating Upholding the Nine-Power Treaty and Inviting the United States to Participate</p>
<p>▲ Also Opposing Hypocrisy towards the League of Nations Covenant</p>
<p>This newspaper translates a report from the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun stating that the Democratic Control Association, organized by British liberals, issued an anti-Japanese declaration on the Sino-Japanese conflict, jointly signed by Labour Party leader Lansbury, MP Cripps, social thinker Lord Russell, and critic Wells. The main points stated that if Japan were to withdraw from the League and take extreme measures, and if Japan did not fulfill its obligations under international regulations, it should still be bound by the League. Therefore, the British government should strictly uphold the Nine-Power Treaty today, and express its willingness to invite the United States to participate. It is reprehensible that Japan is evading various responsibilities, etc. A news report from the American telegraph also stated that the Manchurian problem should be resolved by the League Council's General Assembly, and on the other hand, a Nine-Power Conference should be convened as stipulated by the 1921 Washington Treaty, inviting the United States to participate in the discussion, as the Manchurian problem is a major issue for the entire world. The US government should quickly decide on a fundamental policy, and when it is absolutely necessary, Britain should assist one of the two countries, China and Japan. Since Britain opposes Japan's withdrawal from the League, it should also express its attitude. The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun stated that the Labour Party's organ paper has particularly strong opinions against Japan, attacking Japan's statement to be a challenge to the League of Nations. The statement is hostile to the investigation team appointed by the League of Nations Council, filled with suspicion, sarcasm, and everything else. Furthermore, Japan rejects the power of the Council's General Assembly to discuss and act, which not only goes beyond the scope of the Sino-Japanese conflict but also puts the future of the broader League of Nations and peace mechanisms in serious crisis. Japan's contempt for the League is extreme. The Liberal Party's organ paper stated that the Japanese government's statement, apart from military coercion, cannot accept the report, and that the arguments in its statement defending its actions have no special meaning, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Japanese Expansion of Military, Political, and Economic Power in the Northeast <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ Restoring Armories and Building Steel Mills</p>
<p>▲ Issuing Public Bonds is Also a New Puppet Show</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that the Japanese army in the Northeast is, on the one hand, fighting in various places, vainly hoping to extinguish the righteous army's forces, and on the other hand, establishing its own political, economic, and military forces. Recently, in order to utilize the machinery of the armories in the three eastern provinces to manufacture weapons, it negotiated with the various puppets of the puppet state and decided to start work in mid-March of next spring, naming it the [Fengtian Arsenal Co., Ltd.], directly under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters. The capital is 80 million yuan, with the puppet state government investing 40 million yuan in fixed capital and the Japanese side investing 40 million yuan in working capital. It is reported that the factory buildings, offices, and warehouses of the armory, aviation department, and mortar factory will be assigned to the arsenal, with the factory site extending from Shanzuizi in the east to Huanggu Tun in the west, Ertaizi in the north, and Dananguan in the south. All the factory buildings within it will be used. It is reported that Lieutenant Colonel Yoshikawa has been internally appointed as the factory director, and Majors Amano and Hiraki as deputy factory directors. 1,500 workers will be employed. In addition to rifles and artillery shells, the output can produce 150 to 200 light machine guns, 3 to 6 75mm cannons, 12 to 20 armored vehicles, 3 to 7 tanks, and 40 to 70 cars per month. It is reported that the machinery in each factory only restores one-fifth of the rifle factory, one-thirtieth of the artillery shell factory, one-tenth of the pharmaceutical factory, one-third of the power plant, and one-fifth of the waterworks and steam plant. In the future, when the Japanese side considers it smooth, it will fully restore them and can manufacture guns and cannons themselves. This is not only a symbol of suppressing the righteous army but also of destroying peace in East Asia, because once the machinery in the factory is modified, it can manufacture poison gas and other new weapons. The activities of Japanese soldiers are also very severe. Those who came to the Northeast this month to inspect include Major General Nagata, the Second Department Chief of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, Director Honto, and Secretary Toyo, as well as Regiment Commander Tamon (the first to revolt during the Pan Incident). On the 11th, he went to the eastern border to supervise the army. Recently, the Shenyang County Public Security Bureau ordered each district to carry out suppression of guerrillas. The puppet state government has recently been in extreme poverty and has decided to issue so-called national construction bonds to alleviate the immediate crisis. The fixed amount of the issue is 30 million yuan, with a term of 20 years and an interest rate of 5%, scheduled to be sold in mid-December. However, at this time when people's livelihoods are in dire straits, the people are naturally unable to buy them, and they will be bought by the Japanese, causing the Japanese economic power to extend into the political system. Before March, the Japanese zaibatsu Mitsui once planned to lend 30 million yuan to the puppet state, but it was abandoned for other reasons. Today, the puppet state is issuing 30 million yuan in public bonds, echoing each other before and after, showing that this is another puppet show performed by the Japanese and Chinese traitors. Recently, the Japanese side has also decided to promote the establishment of the Showa Steel Works with a capital of 33 million yen, chaired by Mantetsu's Director Godo. This matter has attracted great attention from all parties because the steel mill is a major steel plant pre-planned by Japan in East Asia, and its military significance is very important.</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Situation in the Sichuan War Changes Again <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>▲ Liu Wenhui's Troops Withdraw from Luzhou and Attack Deng and Tian</p>
<p>▲ But at the Same Time, There are Rumors of a Re-organization of the Baoding Faction</p>
<p>A dispatch from Chongqing states that the Sichuan war, which broke out in the Shunqing area of the north on October 2nd and spread to the east, south, and Chengdu areas, has lasted for nearly two months to this day. According to recent news from various sources and observations of the situation, it has begun to show a tendency to end, but there are still major changes brewing in secret, and the future of the Sichuan situation is still difficult to be optimistic about. The details are as follows: (The bloody battle between the Allied Army and Liu Wenhui) After the conflict between the 24th Army, stationed by Liu Wenhui, and the 23rd Division of Luo Zezhou, stationed in Wusheng, on October 2nd, the Allied Army group was formed. Liu Xiang of the 21st Army, Deng Xihou of the 28th Army, Tian Songyao of the 29th Army, Yang Sen of the 20th Army, Liu Chenghou, the Border Defense Commissioner of Sichuan and Shaanxi, Luo Zezhou of the 23rd Division, and Li Jiayu of the New 6th Division united and jointly opposed the 24th Army. In the northern part of Sichuan, the Allied forces of Li, Luo, Yang, Liu, and Tian launched an attack on the 24th Army. Starting on October 16th, the Allied forces captured Shunqing, Suining, Pengxi, Anyue, and Lezhi of the 24th Army. On November 18th, they attacked Zizhong. Li and Yang fought a bloody battle with Liu Wenhui's troops for three days, engaging in more than ten hand-to-hand combats, before finally capturing Zizhong. It is estimated that the deaths on both sides exceeded a thousand. They then occupied Jianyang. In the southeastern area, Liu Xiang officially fought against the 24th Army on October 21st, and successively occupied Tongnan, Dazu, Yongchuan, Rongchang, Longchang, Jiangjin, and Hejiang, and launched a general attack on Luzhou. The 24th Army dispatched five brigades to defend Luzhou. The two sides held each other for more than half a month, with deaths exceeding 5,000. On the 22nd, Liu Xiang's troops finally captured Luzhou, and then occupied Gulan, Nanxi, Jiang'an, Songxian, Neijiang, Fushun, Rongxian, Yuyuan, Xufu, Naxi, and Yangxian. On November 16th, Tian Songyao and Deng Xihou jointly attacked the 24th Army in Chengdu, engaging in street battles. The two sides held each other for three days, with the total number of deaths exceeding 8,000. The 28th Army had occupied Renshou, Chongqing, and Shuangliu. (The Allied Army Ceases Fire but the Fighting in Chengdu Continues) After capturing Luxian, Xufu, and Rongxian, Liu Xiang of the 21st Army stopped advancing. The vanguard of the Liu army is currently holding a position against the 24th Army in the Jiading area, but neither side has opened fire. Yang Sen and Li Qixiang also stopped military action after capturing Zizhong and Jianyang and convened a meeting of generals in Jianyang to discuss the aftermath of the Sichuan situation. On the surface, the Sichuan war seems to have come to an end and there is hope for a resolution, but the fighting in the Chengdu area is still fierce. Deng, Tian, and Liu are fighting to the death. Before the Sichuan war, Liu Wenhui tried his best to win over Deng Xihou, wanting him to help him protect his strength and was willing to offer Renshou, Shuangliu, and Chongqing, and send 2 million yuan in military expenses. But Tian's army pressed Liu very hard, and Deng Xihou not only did not cover Liu's army but also sided with Tian's army, which angered Liu Wenhui. He then ordered all the troops guarding Luxian to withdraw and completely allow the 21st Army to occupy the counties below Jiading. He then concentrated his strength in Chengdu, fiercely attacking the 28th and 29th armies, to protect his interests in the Chengdu area and the empty title of provincial chairman (because Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province, if Liu abandons it),</p>
<p>the title of chairman will have nothing to attach to). It is estimated that the 24th Army in Chengdu has more than 450 companies. Recently, the Kangchuan army has also been successively transferred back to reinforce Chengdu. The armory of the 29th Army in Chengdu has been occupied by the 24th Army. The headquarters of the 29th Army has been moved to Santai, and the headquarters of the 28th Army has been moved to Hanzhou. The two armies are near Fengshan, 15 miles away from Chengdu, and Chengdu is completely in the hands of the 24th Army. (There is hope for the Baoding faction to reorganize) After the 28th Army withdrew from Chengdu, the army commander Deng Xihou issued a telegram on the 19th, advocating a unanimous ceasefire and peace talks. The second-level generals of the 24th, 28th, and 29th armies all sent telegrams in support, advocating that a Sichuan situation aftermath meeting be held in Zizhong or Suining to jointly discuss and manage Sichuan according to the outline of the Sichuan administration draft of the former 96 generals. At the same time, Xiang Yuren, the deputy commander of the 24th Army, also loudly called for the reorganization of the Baoding faction generals (among the military officers in Sichuan, there are three factions: Baoding,</p>
<p>Quick Training, and Military Officer. Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and Liu Wenhui are from the Baoding faction, Liu Xiang and Yang Sen are from the Quick Training faction, and Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou are from the Military Officer faction. The second-level generals of each army are also mostly from these three factions). They are now separately communicating with Tian and Deng, actively carrying out this plan. Tian and Deng also have the intention of supporting it. New changes are brewing, but they have not yet been revealed on the surface. (November 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Inside Story of the Change in the Guizhou Situation <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mao Guangxiang and Wang Jialie Compete for Power</p>
<p>▲ The Background is Related to the Two Lius in Sichuan</p>
<p>A dispatch from Chongqing states that while the Sichuan war has not yet ended, the Guizhou province has also been heard to have a civil war. In recent days, guns and cannons have been firing on the Wujiang River, and Mao (Guangxiang) and Wang (Jialie) have actually engaged in fighting, which has had a considerable impact on the Sichuan situation and a new change is occurring. Retracing the situation in Guizhou since the death of Zhou Xicheng, Mao Guangxiang took over the military and civilian affairs. For the past two years, it has been quite peaceful, but Wang Jialie, who was guarding the Hongjiang area, due to his sufficient strength and great momentum, urgently wanted to realize his ambition to become the chairman, so he led his troops back to Guizhou, forcing Mao to step down. Seeing Wang's strength, Mao did not dare to compete with him, so he swallowed his anger and handed over both the position of commander of the 25th Army and the chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government to Wang, while he only held the title of commander-in-chief of the 18th Route Army and retreated to his hometown. The various division commanders of the 25th Army, such as You Guocai, Che Mingyi, Hou Zhidan, Song Xing, and Jiang Zaizhen, seeing that Mao did not compete with Wang, also expressed their obedience and supported Wang Jialie in order to preserve their positions and strength. However, although Mao retired to his hometown, he was not actually willing to give up the titles of army commander and chairman to Wang. Secretly, he was still carrying out a plan to regain his position and was secretly contacting various parties. He obtained the consent of You Guocai, Che Mingyi, Hou Zhidan, Jiang Zaizhen, and Song Xing. Mao also sent Li Shihai, the former director of his office in Chongqing, to Chongqing in secret to contact Liu Xiang of the 21st Army to ask for Liu's assistance in the future restoration of his position. Liu also readily agreed and encouraged him to launch the operation because Wang Jialie of Guizhou Province had a close friendship with Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army. If he did not help Mao attack Wang, and the 21st Army attacked the 24th Army, Wang Jialie would inevitably send troops to help Wenhui. Therefore, he used Mao Guangxiang to restrain Wang Jialie in order to weaken Wenhui's strength. At the same time, Hou Zhidan of the Mao faction of the Guizhou army also helped the 21st Army attack the 24th Army. This time, Liu Xiang captured Luxian, and Hou Zhidan of the Guizhou army played a powerful role. After Mao Guangxiang obtained Liu Xiang's support and the support of various generals, he took advantage of the completion of the Zhou Former Chairman's Memorial Hall to convene a meeting of representatives from various counties in Tong (under the pretext of participating in the completion ceremony of the memorial hall). The representatives of the counties also expressed their support. Seeing that the time was ripe, Mao then instructed Jiang Zaizhen of the Third Division stationed in Zunyi and You Guocai and Che Mingyi of Qianxi to deploy military affairs and prepare to</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>launch an operation. After receiving the order, You Guocai and others issued a telegram in the name of various generals, requesting Mao to resume his position and advocating that Wang should be urged to step down and hand over the military and civilian administration through political means first. Otherwise, they would launch an attack. Jiang also intercepted various tax revenues in Zunyi for military use and divided his troops to occupy the area along the Wujiang River, with a great momentum to wave his troops into the province. Wang Jialie believed that the environment was dangerous and that his own strength was limited. If You Guocai, Che Mingyi, Hou Zhidan, and Song Xing unanimously united against him, it would be difficult to deal with. He immediately sent a telegram to Liu Wenhui, requesting assistance. However, Liu Wenhui had already lost the counties in northern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and the eastern part, and Deng and Tian launched an attack in Chengdu, so he felt that it was difficult to cope with himself. He was naturally unable to intervene in the Guizhou affair. Wang was forced to send troops to attack Jiang Zaizhen first. In recent days, the Wujiang River has been shrouded in war clouds, but Jiang Zaizhen's strength is only five regiments. Therefore, he widely recruited bandits from central Guizhou and various places in Sichuan province to form an army to increase his strength. Mao Guangxiang also appointed Yang Qichang, the former Guizhou army division commander, as the independent division commander, and Shuang Qing as the independent brigade commander, to recruit bandits from the border area between Sichuan and Guizhou to form an army and go to the Wujiang River to fight. Mao Guangxiang himself has moved from Tong to Zunyi to command everything, while Hou Zhidan, who is against Wang and supports Mao, has now been reassigned to the 21st Army as the Sichuan-Guizhou Border Defense Commander, and he has stated that he will not intervene in the Guizhou war. As for You Guocai, Che Mingyi, Song Xing, and Jiang Zaizhen, they have already made it clear that they support Mao in reforming the Guizhou situation. Yesterday (November 25th), a telegram was received here stating that fierce fighting had broken out in the Zunyi area, with more than 500 casualties on both sides. You, Che, and others have also actually joined the fighting. You, Hou, and Che each led four regiments of troops and stationed themselves in Qingzhen and Guili, 60 miles away from Guiyang, taking a threatening stance towards Wang Jialie. The scope of the war is bound to expand. It is reported that Wang Jialie has now decided that if the war is unfavorable, he will retreat to Jiading and cooperate with the 24th Army to seek another opportunity to rise. (November 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Jiaoji Railway Will Issue Public Bonds for Redemption <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>▲ Ge Guangting's Talks When Passing Through Jinan</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that the board of directors of the Jiaoji Railway will soon convene a meeting to discuss the issue of redemption of the railway. Now the meeting has been completed. Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, has completed his participation in the meeting and took a train back to Jinan early this morning (27th) and rested at the Jiaoji Hotel. I specially visited him to inquire about the railway redemption method proposed by the board of directors. Ge said that the board of directors was held on the 25th, and the most important case was the railway redemption issue. Those present were Chairman Wang Zhengting, directors Sa Fujun, Cui Shijie, and Yu, four people. When the Jiaoji Railway's 15-year redemption period is approaching in an instant, and the Japanese yen is falling, it is a good opportunity for the railway redemption. The time should not be lost. However, at this time when the national treasury is short of funds, a huge sum of 40 million is definitely not something that can be handled with a snap of the fingers. Therefore, the previously proposed plan to issue public bonds was studied in detail. As a result, a unanimous agreement was reached, but although the method has been agreed upon, as for the future issuance procedures, whether it will be issued by the government, or by this railway, or by the people's groups, it still needs to be approved by the central government. The board of directors has sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Railways has submitted it to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has submitted it to the State Council for resolution. However, in order to ensure that the issuance of public bonds has sufficient guarantees in the future, the Ministry of Railways should submit it to the Executive Yuan and propose it to the State Council, and the national government should issue a clear order. In the future, neither the central government nor the local government should withdraw money from the Jiaoji Railway, and no army should be allowed to detain Jiaoji Railway cars, so as to encourage the purchase of public bonds and redeem the railway property as soon as possible. Because the current national currency of 80 cents can buy one Japanese yen, the debt owed by this railway is 40 million Japanese yen, and only 30 million public bonds need to be issued to be sufficient. If it is not handled in time, the Japanese yen may follow in the footsteps of the French franc, with a distinction between paper money and gold notes. The Japanese will force us to redeem it with gold notes, at which time our country will suffer extremely. This should be noted. Now the railway's business is still good, with a daily cash income of 40,000 yuan, and including the accounting part, it should be in the range of 50,000 yuan. The various coal mines in Zibo have all started work. Although there are losses when they start work, it is still less than the losses of not starting work. Although the Jiaoji Railway has reduced freight rates, it actually does not transport coal, and other goods are also very rare. We are all in the same boat, so we can only help each other. However, this is only temporary. In the future, when the local markets recover, it will not be difficult to restore the original situation. The future prosperity of the Jiaoji Railway has great hope, etc. Ge, who had been away from Qingdao for many days, rested a little and then took the Jiaoji train back to Qingdao at 1:15 p.m. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Opening of a Commercial District in Guangzhou's Dashatou <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>▲ Land Demarcation and Auction in Phases ▲ Relocation of Opium Dens, Gambling Houses, and Brothels First Guangzhou Correspondence: Dashatou in Guangzhou, originally an island near the Dongdi Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station, was initially inhabited by boat-dwelling Tanka people who built shacks and gathered there. Later, military authorities, considering its isolation from the city, established facilities there. Subsequently, aviation authorities also set up facilities in Dashatou, opening an airfield. Most of the Tanka residents relocated, and after several major fires, there are almost no Tanka shacks left. Recently, the air force moved to Shou Gou Ling, and new airfields and hangars were also established in the Shou Gou Ling military camp. Dashatou, a small island, no longer has the strict security of the past. The authorities, seeing its large area, decided to transform it into a commercial district and auction off the entire island's land. The Construction Department, Finance Department, and Municipal Government jointly planned this, and yesterday decided on the land prices and auction methods for Dashatou. The auction will be conducted in three phases, with each phase lasting six months. The first phase starts immediately, while the second and third phases will be implemented later. As for the land prices, they are divided into three grades: first-grade land is priced at 500 yuan per hua bing (a unit of area), second-grade land at 450 yuan per hua bing, and third-grade land at 400 yuan per hua bing. In the first phase, land facing east is classified as Grade A, land facing north and south as Grade B, and land facing west as Grade C. The land price for arcaded areas along roads will be charged at 50% of the auction price per bing. As for the existing Japanese-owned businesses, separate prices will be determined for their acquisition. When acquiring private properties, a notice will be published in the newspaper, and owners must register immediately, with a one-month deadline from the date of registration. The method of compensation for land prices will be determined separately. The transformation of Dashatou into a commercial district aims to develop a prosperous area as a preliminary step. However, to achieve prosperity, the first priority is to equip the area with entertainment venues. The authorities plan to order all opium dens, gambling houses, brothels, and pleasure boats in Guangzhou to relocate to Dashatou. However, it is difficult to force these establishments to relocate immediately, so a method of "banning through taxation" is being considered. It is stipulated that these establishments must relocate within six months. After six months, those who do not comply with the relocation order will have their original house rent doubled, starting from the seventh month. The landlords will collect this amount from their tenants and hand it over as an entertainment tax, which will be used to repair entertainment venues. After one year, those who still do not comply with the relocation order will have their original house rent tripled, starting from the thirteenth month. After one and a half years, those who still do not relocate will have their original house rent quadrupled, starting from the nineteenth month. In general, each phase lasts six months, with the tax increasing by one fold in each period. This escalating taxation will force them to be unable to maintain their businesses and voluntarily relocate. (November 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Bean Cake Tax Dispute in Chao-Shan <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>▲ Customs detains imported bean cakes Shantou correspondence: Bean cake is the best fertilizer produced domestically, originating from Dalian, Andong, Niuzhuang, Hankou, and other places. Approximately 800,000 dan (a unit of weight) are shipped to Chao-Shan annually. The Taili Company in Shantou is contracted to collect a special tax on imported sulfuric acid fertilizers. This special tax is an additional charge for the construction of Zhongshan University's campus. The company remits 270,000 yuan to the Department of Finance annually, having been approved to handle this tax. However, the company, concealing the truth from its superiors, claimed that domestically produced bean cakes were also imported goods and should be taxed together. The superiors, believing this, immediately approved the collection. The company then notified various grain stores to inspect and tax the bean cakes in their warehouses, setting a deadline of November 24th for reporting and payment, with a tax of 8 jiao (a unit of currency) and 2.5 fen (a subunit of currency) per dan. Bean cake merchants were dissatisfied, arguing that bean cake is clearly made from domestic soybeans and peanuts, transported from the northern coast, so how could it be considered imported goods? Furthermore, the government's tax on imported sulfuric acid fertilizer was intended to preserve the sales of domestic bean cake. The Taili Company started operations on August 1st, and its announcement at the time mentioned this. Just over a hundred days have passed, and it cannot be so forgetful. The Shantou North-South Port Freight Association therefore decided to telegraph the provincial government to object, and simultaneously petitioned the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Shantou Municipal Government, and the Public Security Bureau to order the police to protect the goods and prevent the company from detaining merchant goods, awaiting a government resolution. Meanwhile, Chen Shaowen and others were dispatched to the province to petition the Department of Finance to stop the collection of bean cake tax, and to explain that if bean cake cannot be shipped to Shantou for sale this winter, farmland will lack fertilizer next spring, making it difficult to expect a good harvest, which would have a significant impact. However, the provincial government's attitude is still unknown. Furthermore, yesterday a batch of bean cake shipped from Yingkou arrived, and the Taili Company immediately sent inspectors to force various firms to report and pay fees to the company. Mingfeng and other firms, because the ship was chartered and could not delay its departure, had no choice but to report and pay tax to the company. It is said that according to the company's tax collection method, the Shantou bean cake tax alone could generate over one million yuan annually. The Taili Company's contracted tax on fertilizers for the entire province is only 270,000 yuan, so its profits are unexpectedly high, while the government and the people both suffer losses. Therefore, it is not acceptable to bean cake merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Plea from All Circles in Beiping: Do Not Relocate Ancient Artifacts <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Seeing reports that the Central Government was planning to move the ancient artifacts of the Forbidden City to Luoyang for preservation, all circles in Beiping jointly sent a telegram, stating the advantages and disadvantages, and requesting that the proposal be reconsidered. The telegram is transcribed below: ▲ Telegram One: We have just read reports stating that the Central Political Council has decided to transport the ancient artifacts of the Beiping Forbidden City to Luoyang. All the people and organizations in the city are extremely alarmed, believing that the Central Government is abandoning Beiping and cutting off the people's lives. The cultural development plan for the prosperity of Beiping is paramount. Without the ancient artifacts of the Forbidden City, culture would have no basis, and foreign tourists and researchers would have no direction. Beiping would inevitably decline day by day, making it difficult to survive. The intention to transport the artifacts to Luoyang is solely to avoid the enemy. However, it must be understood that the way to establish a nation is to resist the enemy, not to avoid them. Retreating step by step is the way to national ruin. Unnecessarily showing weakness to others is to abandon Beiping. Does Beiping have land and people that will also be moved? If not, why are ancient artifacts considered more important, and the people and land less important? Even for the sake of the ancient artifacts, moving them to Luoyang does not guarantee their safety. Beiping is the location of embassies from various countries, and the Forbidden City is close at hand, under the watchful eyes of all. Ancient artifacts are related to culture, not the same as war materials. Even if the enemy is strong and violent, they should not dare to destroy them wantonly. Moreover, the League of Nations is seeking a resolution to the dispute between the two countries. The responsibility for the past lies with the other side, and they are trying to shirk it. If they were to add troops to Beiping without reason, the responsibility would be even greater. Anyone with vision would not dare to do this at this time. Therefore, it is unwise to create panic. Luoyang is not a safe place. Those who know the past should know that there are many bandits there. Transporting ancient artifacts there is like sending a sheep into a tiger's den. The Forbidden City in Beiping has deep moats and high walls, making defense easy. Supervision from all sides is also strict. Luoyang has nothing, so how can it be preserved? We fear that it will not be destroyed by the enemy, but various disasters will be enough to endanger the ancient artifacts. This is a complete reversal of reality and ideals. There are many rumors outside that moving the artifacts to Luoyang is only a pretext. Once they leave Beiping, they will be transferred and sold. This is contrary to reason, so it is no wonder people are suspicious. In summary, the ancient artifacts of the Forbidden City and the people of Beiping share a common destiny. If we seek safety on the spot, the people will do their best to help. If the Central Government does not love Beiping, does not listen to the people's opinions, acts selfishly for the benefit of a few, and disregards the consequences, the people of Beiping will lie down on the tracks and perish with the ancient artifacts. We urge the leaders of the Party and the nation to consider this carefully. If the reports are true, please cancel the decision immediately. If there is no such plan, please make a clear statement to dispel public doubts. In the future, the method of preservation should be made public to avoid manipulation, so that the ancient artifacts can be preserved permanently. This is the fervent hope of all organizations. We respectfully submit this telegram and humbly request your consideration. Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Public Offices of Autonomous Districts in Beiping, Beiping General Labor Union, Beiping Farmers' Association, Youth Association, Education Association, Good Youth Association ▲ Telegram Two: Reports state that the Central Political Council held a meeting the other day and resolved to move the ancient artifacts of the Beiping Forbidden City to Luoyang for safekeeping, ordering the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways to be responsible for transportation. The merchants and people here are perplexed, believing that the essence of culture has been gathered here for hundreds of years, attracting the attention of the world. Once it is moved, it will lose its center of gravity. This is the first point. These precious objects have been cherished for many years, and we are still worried about damage. The railway transportation is precarious in every way. This is the second point. The walls and palaces here are not afraid of petty theft. Furthermore, we are building secret vaults, making them even more secure. Luoyang has broken walls and ruins, with wind and rain howling. In terms of safekeeping, which is better? This is the third point. The national capital has already been determined, and moving the ancient artifacts to Luoyang will encourage people to despise it. This is the fourth point. If there is a compelling reason, we ask, if we can go, can't the enemy? It only shows weakness to others and increases the enemy's intentions. This is the fifth point. If the government takes this action, it indicates abandonment of Beiping. How can we encourage the morale of those who are determined to resist the enemy to the death? How can we consolidate the hearts of the people to resist the enemy united? This association, representing hundreds of thousands of merchants and people in the city, vows to express solidarity with various popular organizations to prevent its implementation and to coexist with the ancient artifacts. We implore you to immediately reconsider this proposal to avoid misunderstandings at home and abroad. It is a blessing for the national essence, a blessing for the country!

<p>▲ Six to Seven Thousand Exhibits The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Products Exhibition, which has been in preparation by the Construction Department for two months, is now ready. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 9:00 AM today (December 1st), and the exhibition will open to the public from 2:00 PM. The exhibition venue has been set up in recent days. The response to the call for agricultural products has been exceptionally enthusiastic. As of the afternoon of the 30th, submissions had been received from 62 counties. Other affiliated institutions of the Construction Department, such as rice, wheat, cotton, silk, forestry, and entomology, as well as agricultural, sericultural, and aquatic product schools, have also submitted special products. The Huangyan tangerines, Yueqing pears, Hangzhou persimmons, Xiangshan and Taishun medicinal herbs, Xinchang and Songyang tobacco leaves, and Linhai, Haiyan, and Yuhuan aquatic products are particularly famous. The rice seeds submitted by various counties are numerous, reaching six to seven hundred varieties. There are also many imported varieties. A total of over three thousand items have been sent by various counties. Affiliated institutions of the Construction Department have also sent over three thousand items. The exhibition is divided into two major sections. Products from various counties are classified and displayed for competition and observation. Products from affiliated institutions of the Construction Department and vocational schools are classified by institution as a reference. Therefore, the products from various counties will be thoroughly reviewed after the closing ceremony, and ranks will be determined to award certificates. Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Construction Department, believes that the agricultural products exhibition contains the nature of improving agricultural products and promoting high-quality seeds, so the mission is significant. Therefore, he rushed back to the provincial capital from eastern Zhejiang on the afternoon of the 30th to personally preside over the opening ceremony today. It is reported that after the opening ceremony today, the association will invite agricultural experts Xu Shuji, Wang Jinwu, Zhang Fancun, and Chen Shimin to broadcast lectures on agricultural issues from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM every day.

<p>▲ Frequent Bandit Alarms During Winter Defense The county is currently carrying out winter defense measures, but theft cases still occur from time to time. Last night at 10:00 PM, at the residence of Feng Jinru and Feng Yinru in Fengjiazhai, about three li (a unit of distance) outside the North Gate, six bandits suddenly arrived with pistols and sharp blades. They broke into the house and tied up Feng Jinru and others with ropes. Feng Yinru's wife resisted and was violently stabbed in the right leg by the bandits, sustaining two injuries and bleeding profusely. The bandits then began searching, looting gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and other items worth over 300 yuan. The First Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the East Gate rushed to pursue them after hearing the alarm, but the bandits had already gone far. Furthermore, at the home of Zhao Xingyan, a farmer in Nianwu Tu near Hangtou Zhen, over ten bandits suddenly arrived at approximately the same time the night before, wielding iron rods, breaking into the house through the windows. They immediately tied up and beat Zhao Xingyan and others, forcing him to reveal the location of hidden silver. Zhao Xingyan firmly refused to speak and was burned with candles and struck with iron rods, causing burns to his head and serious injuries. The bandits searched for a long time, looting silver, clothing, and other items, and then left in a swagger.</p>

<p>▲ Mei Lanfang Visits Suzhou to Tour Scenic Spots The famous actor Mei Lanfang, along with his entourage of over twenty family members, arrived in Suzhou from Beijing at 9:18 PM on the 29th and stayed at the Railway Hotel in Dingjia Lane. Yesterday (the 30th) morning, he hired a motorboat to tour scenic spots such as Tianping Mountain. He plans to tour Qiupu today and is scheduled to visit the Daohe Qushe on the 2nd to perform Kunqu opera. He will stay for about two or three days before taking a train to Shanghai. ▲ Three Legal Organizations Telegraphed to Stop the Additional Grain Tax In view of the fact that the Suzhou Provincial Government temporarily imposed an additional two yuan on the land tax during the Northern Expedition due to urgent military expenses, the Wu County Agricultural, Commercial, and Educational Legal Organizations, in a joint telegram, requested that the Suzhou Provincial Government add it again for another year during the bandit suppression period in 1919. At that time, the Ministry of Finance approved the request, stipulating that after the expiration of the period, the Suzhou Provincial Government should not request an extension under any name. Now, it is reported that the Suzhou Provincial Government is again requesting an extension under a fictitious name. Yesterday (the 30th), they specially jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that it be stopped quickly to maintain the government's credibility and comfort public expectations. Furthermore, before the case is approved, they also requested that the Suzhou Provincial Government be instructed to temporarily suspend the requisition. ▲ Rickshaw Driver Commits Assault, Arousing Public Outrage Wu Quanlin, a foreman at the Suzhou Telegraph Bureau, was violently assaulted by a rickshaw driver from the Lin Mansion near the Sibaidu Garden Hotel outside the gate the day before. He was immediately taken to the police district in charge. Subsequently, the Lin Mansion released the rickshaw driver on bail. However, the workers of the Telegraph Bureau were outraged that Wu Quanlin had been assaulted by the Lin rickshaw driver and was not handed over to the judiciary for handling. They were unusually resentful and about to stage a strike. Yesterday (the 30th), the bureau sent a letter to the county government, requesting that the rickshaw driver be severely punished to appease public anger.</p>

<p>▲ Rampant Corruption in Tax Collection Agency With the approval of the Provincial Government, Shu Shifu of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance issued a notice to all counties to uniformly establish tax collection agencies. All sales and transfers of houses and land would be officially collected and processed by the tax collection agency, and official stamped receipts would be issued at any time. Wang Li, Director of the Local Finance Bureau, followed the order and organized the agency, appointing Lu Dingxin as the director and selecting sixteen staff members from the district offices. The tax collection fee was 4 jiao 5 fen per 100 yuan, and it was also announced that various fees such as book-giving rice should be abolished. However, the district offices, upon hearing this, were greatly dissatisfied because their income had decreased sharply. Therefore, they went around lobbying the authorities, tacitly agreeing to collect the book-giving rice and other illegal fees in secret in addition to the tax collection fee. Rampant corruption caused a heavier burden for ordinary villagers, who dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Therefore, although the tax collection agency was established, it was actually just a change of name, and the system was no different from the district office system. ▲ Two Cases of Robbery and Assault The family of Widow Guo Dongshi in Qianjia village, Nanfangquan, District 14, was poor. She had a son and a daughter-in-law who helped with farming. Suddenly, at approximately 10:00 PM the night before, two bandits speaking with a strong northern accent and wearing blue cloths on their faces broke into the house. They shone flashlights around the room where Ms. Guo was sleeping. Ms. Guo woke up from her dream. One of the bandits immediately stabbed her with an iron sword. Ms. Guo used her hand to grab the iron sword and held it tightly. The bandits struggled to snatch it away, pushing Ms. Guo to the ground and scratching her throat with their fingers. In a moment of desperation, Ms. Guo immediately shouted, "Catch the robbers!" Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the bandits abandoned the sword and fled empty-handed. After inspection, there were no losses. She immediately reported this to Lu Difan, the head of District 14, who then reported it to the county government for investigation. Also, at approximately 2:00 AM the night before, the house of Zheng Quangen in Nanjie, Yuqi Town, District 15, was suddenly attacked by five or six bandits armed with sharp blades, who threatened them to remain silent and looted at will. They also used the sharp blades to stab three wounds in Zheng's head. After inspection, the losses were estimated at over 20 yuan. The victim reported this to the 15th Public Security Branch, requesting the arrest of the bandits.</p>

<p>▲ Former Head of the Second District Accused of Embezzlement Hu Sheng, the former head of the Second District, has been repeatedly sued by Yang Hongyuan and other citizens of the district for allegedly embezzling public funds during his tenure. The lawsuit mainly stated that when the Songhu War broke out this spring, the army arrived in the county to defend it. He had constructed defense projects and installed military telephones, etc. The materials used in Meili and other areas were all purchased by District Head Hu. However, Hu falsely reported the quantities and embezzled huge amounts of money. Just take the telephone lead wire as an example. According to the installation certificate, 350 jin (a unit of weight) were actually used, while his reimbursement request was for 557 jin. After receiving the report, the county government repeatedly held court hearings, but District Head Hu did not appear in court. Later, County Magistrate Tan, in order to ease public anger, transferred the two district heads because Pan Zhengfen, the head of the Twelfth District, was also accused of embezzlement, so as to achieve the best of both worlds. However, the plaintiff, Yang Hongyuan, still refused to give up and filed a lawsuit with the Wu County District Court. He was summoned in mid-month, but Hu did not appear, so a warrant was issued. He was summoned on the 28th of this month. On that day, the plaintiff, the defendant, and the witness, Lu Shaozeng, all complied with the summons and went to Suzhou to await the hearing. The District Court was opened for investigation by Prosecutor Lu Wenqin. The plaintiff and the witness stated the above, while the defendant Hu and the accountant Tao Yu both denied the previous facts and attached receipts from the Third Battalion of the First Brigade of the Forty-seventh Division. As a result, the court ordered the defendant Hu Sheng and Tao Yu to be released on bail. Now, people in Meili Township, because the transferred District Head Pan Zhengfen had previously been accused of embezzlement by the original township chiefs and had not made public any financial matters since March, have requested the county government to remove him by Lu Shaozeng and other members of the Party in a petition signed by 120 people. ▲ An Elderly Man from Suzhou Comes to Changshu to Commit Suicide Huang Yongkang, an elderly man from Suzhou, suddenly left Suzhou for Changshu on the 24th for unknown reasons. His family searched everywhere for him, but there was no trace of him. Just as they were worrying, they suddenly received a letter on the 25th, stating that he was tired of life and would not return home. His family matters could be properly handled, etc. After reading it, his son was terrified. He checked the postmark, which was from Changshu, so he immediately took a boat to Changshu to find him. It was not until the night of the 28th that he was found in the Fuchang Inn in Beizhao Lane here. Meeting his family, he was overjoyed and frightened. The next morning, they returned to Suzhou together.</p>

<p>▲ Party Committee Member Robbed En Route Chen Xiaoqing, a member of the County Party Committee Executive Committee, along with Yan Xiehe, an employee of the Security Committee, Zhou Zhongji, a secretary of the County Government, Zhang Zongru, the town head of Qin Nan, and others, were robbed on the 27th night while traveling by boat from Qingyang to Yuecheng Bridge. When passing through the ferry crossing, they were suddenly boarded by five or six bandits, who robbed them and stripped them of their clothes. Yan Xiehe, because he contracted a special cargo in Qin Nan and had over ten liang (a unit of weight) of goods, was also robbed. The six people lost over 100 yuan in total. ▲ District-Based Winter Defense Implemented in the City Liu Hanzhen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, held a winter defense meeting on the 28th in accordance with past practice and decided that the city's defense would be divided into five districts: east, west, south, north, and center, with Lu Zong and others being appointed as the director and deputy director, and assigning defense duties to each district. The defense period is stipulated to be from December 1st to March 1st of the following year. ▲ Notorious Bandit Lu Zhanglin Arrested in Tongzhou Lu Zhanglin, from Anquan Village, Sanguan Township, East Suburbs, is a notorious bandit in the eastern countryside. He has committed numerous murders and kidnappings and has been wanted by the county government with a reward of 800 yuan, but has not been captured. On the 26th, the Public Security Bureau suddenly received a tip from an informant that the bandit Lu was hiding in the Liu family in Guandian Lane, West Gate, Nantong. Director Liu immediately reported this to the county government and captured the bandit Lu. Yesterday (the 29th), he was escorted to Chengcheng on the Dahe Ship of the Dada Company and taken to the Public Security Bureau. According to Lu, he joined the Party and became a bandit in 1926. After escaping to Shanghai last year, he lived in Zhabei, Hangzhou. He went to Nantong this time to borrow money from a friend, but was arrested. The cases in the countryside were all impersonated by others. He had only committed three cases: kidnapping Zhan Wenqiao of the Miao Shou She and robbing the Wang family's residence in Wangjiadai and the Wu family's residence in Qifang Village. He was immediately imprisoned and taken to the county government for interrogation today (the 30th).</p>

<p>▲ Jiangsu Plans to Establish a Provincial Water Police Bureau Recently, due to the lack of security and the rise of bandits, navigation has become especially dangerous. News of river steamers being robbed has been heard from time to time. Although there is a provincial public security team on the water, the jurisdiction is vast and each district is self-governing. It is difficult to achieve a consistent and coordinated bandit suppression effort. It is reported that in order to ensure the safety of water travelers and unify the command of the provincial water public security teams, the province plans to establish a provincial water police bureau to command the provincial public security teams in various districts. Its authority will be the same as the former water police department, and the organization will be entirely modeled after the current Zhejiang water police bureau. It is currently in the planning stage, and its implementation should not be far off. It is said that the counties will also expand their water public security forces to supplement the shortage of police force in the township public security bureaus. After implementation, the existing Su-Song Water Bandit Suppression Command will also be abolished to unify power. ▲ Construction Department Inspects the Zhenjiang Reservoir Project According to the report submitted by the Zhenjiang County Government, the Zhenjiang County Reservoir Engineering Committee has gradually completed the new and old mountain reservoirs in Shangdang, Suifeng, Gaozi, and other townships in this session. The Construction Department ordered Zhong Zhiying, Director of the Zhenjiang County Construction Bureau, to go to Zhenjiang County to conduct a thorough inspection and acceptance.</p>

<p>▲ Northern Jiangsu Counties Implement Anti-Bandit Curfews According to confidential reports, the military police in Tongzhou, Rugao, and Haimen Counties in northern Jiangsu have learned that a large number of bandits from Shanghai have infiltrated the inland areas, hoping to seize weapons and ammunition from the self-defense corps and cause trouble. Therefore, a temporary curfew was implemented to prevent accidents. ▲ The Reclamation District Chief Executes the Soldier-Cultivated Land Case Regarding the compensation to be paid by the Tonghai Reclamation and Husbandry Company for the soldier-cultivated land in Sulang Liangying, the National Government ordered the company to supplement the price or take back the land for auction. On the 29th, Magistrate Zhang, upon receiving the order, instructed Shen Shaochang, the chief of the Reclamation District, to strictly order the person in charge of the company to earnestly comply and reply in writing within five days. ▲ The Department of Civil Affairs Orders the County to Return the Reward Money The county police team arrested the notorious bandit Feng Ziyun in Liuhe, and the local resident Ding Shaoshan specially rewarded them with 1,000 yuan. After receiving the report, the Department of Civil Affairs believed that it was their duty to suppress and capture bandits, so there was no reason to accept the people's reward of 1,000 yuan, and ordered the county to instruct them to return the full amount of the original money.</p>

<h3 id="e89">This Year's Trend in Foreign Rice Imports <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>▲ Index from January to September</p>
<p>▲ April as the Peak, the issue of regulating rice prices is currently attracting much attention from various sectors. This is because our country is originally an agricultural nation, with farmers accounting for about three-quarters of the national population. Therefore, agricultural products are of great importance to our country's economy and the people's livelihood, especially rice, which people need daily for their lives. The reason for the drop in grain prices this year is due to the bumper harvest of domestic produce, the competition from foreign rice, and the obstacles in transportation and shipping, which have led to difficulties in sales and caused this serious problem. Although there is no precise investigation into the bumper harvest situation, it is generally understood that ordinary yields have increased by several percent, while excellent yields have even doubled. Regarding the competitive sales of foreign rice, according to the "International Trade Statistics" compiled and printed by the International Trade Bureau, the import index of foreign rice from February to September of this year (with the average of 1926 as the base number) is: (February) 89.18, (March) 151.94, (April) 176.10, (May) 168.48, (June) 115.28, (July) 111.21, (August) 98.62, (September) 75.04. The above numbers show a gradual decreasing trend with April as the peak. Furthermore, most of these imports are destined for Guangdong, as the transportation of rice from Jiangnan and Jiangbei is inconvenient, making the import of rice from Vietnam and Burma more convenient and cheaper. Therefore, the entire problem lies in the obstacles and inconvenience of domestic transportation. According to He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, if one wants to find a solution to the rice price issue, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways must work together. The International Trade Bureau, recognizing the severity of this issue, is discussing effective measures to adopt, even without any instructions.</p>

<p>▲ Dong Rongji and Three Representatives Arrive in Shanghai ▲ Cai Zimin and Others Are Willing to Eagerly Assist The Northeastern Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army's Dong Rongji and his troops are stationed in the western Liaoning area, fighting desperately against the enemy. They have fought over a hundred battles, large and small, for years without slackening. Now, due to the large-scale offensive by the Japanese invaders, the shortage of guns and ammunition, and the thin clothing in the severe winter, their combat effectiveness has been greatly affected. Therefore, they have sent Liu Xingbang, Zhan Guofu, and Zhou Min to Shanghai to report to various circles and seek assistance in order to fulfill their ambition to kill the enemy. In recent days, the representatives have given speeches at schools such as Quanzhang Middle School, moving all those who listened. It is now heard that organizations such as the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association, the Overseas Chinese Federation, the Jin Hui Guildhall, the Southern Fujian Township Association, and the San Yu Society have all expressed their willingness to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Cai Yuanpei, Li Liejun, He Xiangning, Jing Hengyi, Song Yuanyuan, Wu Zonglian, Wu Kai, Wu Yi, Jiang Zhou, Yu Jianzhong, Zhao Chao and others jointly sent a letter to the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association requesting assistance on their behalf. The original letter is transcribed below: To Messrs.

All the details have been previously investigated by the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation, which repeatedly sent special personnel such as Zhang Yunming to conduct on-site investigations and confirmed the facts. They have been forwarded to your association for approval and relief. However, at this time of icy and snowy autumn, the soldiers on the front line are truly in danger of freezing to death at any moment. We earnestly request that all enthusiastic gentlemen provide whatever assistance they can as soon as possible so that the representatives can return north early, and those who receive the favor will work even harder to defeat the enemy.</p>

Kong Xiangxi, Special Envoy for Industrial Investigation of Various Countries, sent a letter from his New York office at 51st Street to Xu Shiying, Xiong Xiling, Wang Xiating, Qu Yingguang, Zhao Xien, Wang Jue, Wang Han and others, saying: Jingren, Bing San, Jiatang, Wenliu, Jinqing, Yiheng, Hanzhi, gentlemen: Across the vast ocean, all my thoughts are with you. I was overjoyed and comforted to read the great letter, and I am impressed by the thorough planning and far-reaching benefits of your organization of the United Association for Aiding Northeastern Refugees and the advance payment of funds to address the urgent needs of the Northeast. During my trip to America, I passed through Honolulu, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and other places, where I either received representatives from overseas Chinese or attended gatherings of overseas Chinese merchants and organizations. I explained the difficult situation in the Northeast and the details of the efforts of charitable organizations in Shanghai, and I informed them of the establishment of the Shanghai United Association, requesting that donations be sent to you for effective use. The overseas Chinese merchants were all deeply moved upon hearing this. I heard that San Francisco collected ten thousand dollars last month, and Chicago collected forty thousand dollars, which have been remitted one after another. I am confident that with your enthusiasm and promotion, donations will continue to increase. I have already sent donation booklets and publications to various ports to widely solicit donations. My industrial investigation in America will take another two or three weeks, and I plan to travel to Europe at the end of the month. I am writing to inform you of my situation and to pay my respects. Respectfully, Kong Xiangxi, November 5th. ▲ Using Entertainment Donations. The association had previously written to the government requesting that the entertainment donations collected be allocated to aid Northeastern refugees. This time, when Xu Jingren heard that Lan Ting, Li Zubao and others were passing through Beijing, they discussed it again. The association received a telegram from Xu, Lan, and Li yesterday, stating that Minister Zhu said that once the additional entertainment donations are implemented and have generated a significant amount, he will invite representatives from all sectors to discuss the distribution. The English representatives left Beijing for Shanghai yesterday afternoon. ▲ Aid Work in the Northeast. The association received a letter from Feng Shifen, a representative from beyond the pass, stating: The previous letter mentioned that the Bank of China remitted 50,000 Shanghai dollars, which has been received. This amount is equivalent to 59,450 Harbin dollars. If converted to cash, it would be about 49,600 Shanghai dollars, with Shanghai dollars being worth 7% more. The association mostly uses Harbin dollars. However, the exchange rate for Harbin dollars fluctuates daily. Currently, 10,000 sets of cotton clothes are being made here, requiring 34,500 Harbin dollars, plus approximately 500 dollars for shipping. The remainder has been remitted to Harbin to purchase aid supplies. Fenfeng left Changchun on the 24th to go to Harbin to work with Luo Shulao (named Zhenyu) and others in the Temporary Disaster Relief Association to jointly handle the distribution. The relief tickets will be under the sole name of this association and 20,000 have already been printed with a stamp, under the name of the Shanghai Nine Charitable Organizations Joint Relief Association Office in Harbin. ▲ Xiamen Remits Relief Funds. The association received 100 yuan from Xiamen University to aid Northeastern refugees. ▲ Qu Wenliu's Letter. The association's representative office received a telegram from Qu Yingguang stating that he received the bill of lading for 7,000 sets of cotton clothing from Taikoo Company and a passport, and he will forward them to the office and send someone to retrieve them. He will then send a receipt for verification. Please inquire with the Chamber of Commerce and colleagues in Shanghai whether to start a disaster relief Dharma assembly in Shanghai to facilitate coordination.</p>

<p>▲ Achievements of Various Trade Guilds in Fundraising</p>
<p>The Donation Affairs Committee of the Shanghai Northeastern Refugee Relief Association held its first meeting of committee members at 2 PM yesterday at the meeting room on the third floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Chen Songyuan of the cotton cloth industry, Shen Dada of the silk factory industry, Zhang Peizhen of the paper industry, Ge Jichen of the woolen cloth industry, Yang Xiongzhan of the Chinese merchandise industry, Jin Chuxiang of the salted fish industry, Lu Xiaozuo of the gravel industry, Chen Weiwen of the grocery industry, Wang Liangyu of the land freight industry, Deng Xuezai of the fireworks industry, Chen Guanghai of the cattle and sheep industry, Zhou Ruzhun of the laundry industry, Xin Wenyao of the pig industry, Xie Zhongyu of the feather flower industry, and Huanzhang of the Zhong industry attended.

First, the chairman reported on the background of the committee members, the current status of the Donation Affairs Committee of the Relief Association, and the telegram from General Xu Ziqiao in Peiping regarding the recent situation of the Northeastern refugees, urging the collection of 300,000 yuan for urgent relief in the Northeast. He expressed his hope that everyone would work hard to promote the monthly donation campaign, solicit donations widely, and ensure that the righteous people receive continuous assistance. Subsequently, Jin Chuxiang, Yuan Hongjun, Wang Liangyu, and Yang Xiongzhan, the representatives of each trade guild, reported on the progress of the monthly donation campaign in their respective guilds before the meeting adjourned. The fundraising situation of each trade guild is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Pawn Industry Pays Donations. The association, together with the pawn industry guilds in the concession (i.e., the new industry guilds), solicited donations from pawn shops throughout the city (it is reported that they have raised).</p>
<p>155 Shanghai dollars. This amount, along with the donation booklet, was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday for transfer to the association, which will issue a receipt.</p>
<p>▲ The Firewood and Charcoal Industry Continues Fundraising. The industry has been actively soliciting donations through salesmen. The first round has raised 115 yuan, which has been sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for collection. It is reported that they are still continuing to solicit donations.</p>

<p>▲ Saving Money from Candy and Snacks, One Yuan ▲ Purchasing Carnival Tickets to Aid Northeastern Refugees</p>
<p>Since the Northeastern Refugee Relief Carnival, jointly organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Accountants Association, and the Lawyers Association, was announced in major newspapers, enthusiastic patriots have been sending letters to purchase tickets. It is reported that the association has received over 2,000 ticket purchase letters in the past two days, demonstrating the concern of the Chinese people for the Northeast. Yesterday, among the mail received by the association was a letter from a 13-year-old elementary school student and a 7-year-old kindergarten student who were willing to save the candy and snack money given to them daily by their father to donate one yuan to purchase a ticket. Although the wording was simple, their passionate patriotism overflowed from their words. The original letter is transcribed below: We all hate the Japanese. Teacher often talks about it, and Dad also talks about it. Last night, Dad read the newspaper advertisement to us and talked about it for a long time. I am willing to start today, after school, not to eat snacks. Mom gives me ten copper coins, save one a month to buy a ticket. My sister is also willing to save to buy a ticket to send. Take the money. Elementary School Student, Yang Shixun, 12 years old. My brother loves the country, and I love the country too. Yang Juefang, 7 years old. November 27th, No. 1, Jingxiu Lane, Wudong Road, Xiaoximen. ▲ Social Affairs Bureau Employees Donate Salaries. The Social Affairs Bureau, in order to aid the Northeastern Volunteer Army, decided at its seventh bureau affairs meeting to start from the eleventh of this month to deduct two percent of the monthly salaries of all employees of the bureau and its affiliated institutions, including the National Goods Exhibition Hall, the Fisheries Guidance Institute, the Weights and Measures Verification Institute, and the Municipal Forestry Farm, to donate to the Northeastern Volunteer Army. The bureau issued a notice yesterday that the deduction has been made by the accounting office, totaling over 200 yuan, which will be handed over to the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association.</p>
<p>▲ The Cotton Cloth Industry Has Raised Four Thousand. The monthly donation solicitation team of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association for Northeastern refugees, led by Sun Zhangmaorong and Chen Songyuan of the second solicitation committee, and Xia Zaiting, the chairman of the committee, set out yesterday to solicit donations.

<h3 id="e97">Li Liejun on National Salvation <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>▲ Talking to Central News Agency Reporters</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee has been set for the 15th of this month in Nanjing. At this time of internal and external troubles, the Chinese people should be united from top to bottom to jointly discuss major plans for national salvation. The Central Committee members staying in Shanghai have decided to gather in the capital before the meeting to attend the conference and have drafted a general proposal to be submitted at the conference. However, in order to solicit the opinions of the Central Committee members in Guangdong on the Plenary Session, Liu Luyin, Bai Wenwei, Cheng Qian, Zhang Zhiben, and four others have gone to Guangdong for discussions. Regarding this news, Li Liejun, a Central Committee member staying in Shanghai, made the following statement to the Central News Agency reporters yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ Guangdong Committee Members Cannot Attend Fully. According to the statement, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee is extremely important for the survival of the nation, so the opinions of all parties should be consistent. Therefore, Liu Luyin, Bai Wenwei, Cheng Qian, and Zhang Zhiben are currently going south to meet with the Central Committee members staying in Guangdong to solicit opinions and inquire about the general proposal drafted by the Central Committee members staying in Shanghai, so as to gather a wide range of views. Furthermore, given the large number of Northeastern refugees entering the customs and the lack of relief measures, Bai and others will also consult with the Guangdong side on solutions for refugee relief, so that the displaced Northeastern compatriots will not starve to death. Whether all of the Central Committee members staying in Guangdong will be able to attend the Plenary Session is still undecided. It seems certain that Hu Hanmin will not be able to attend in Nanjing.</p>
<p>▲ The Reasons for Internal Strife Are No More Than Three. Liu also said that internal strife in our country has increased year by year. Examining the causes of internal strife, there are no more than three: (1) The government cannot get on the right track due to the inability to achieve equal governance and realize national politics, so that politics can be put on the right track; (2) Sun's doctrine cannot be fully realized. Sun's Three Principles of the People are the doctrine of national salvation. At this time of national crisis, the members of our party must take on the responsibility of saving the country and realizing the Three Principles of the People; (3) People's hearts have fallen into pessimism. To save China from danger, we must first save people's hearts from falling into pessimism. Lao Tzu said, "Sorrow is greater than the death of the heart." Although the hearts of the Chinese people are not completely dead, they have fallen into a state of pessimism. Pessimism is the first step towards the death of the heart. The way to save it is to wait for the Plenary Session to decide on a plan and gradually implement it step by step. Then the internal strife will stop, and the government will be put on the right track. Sun's doctrine will be fully implemented, and the pessimism of the people's hearts will naturally disappear. The hope will arise spontaneously, hope will become a reality, and reality will become a belief. Then pessimism will disappear and optimism will come, and the country will have a future. If the situation after the Plenary Session remains the same as it is now, then the country's future is truly worrying.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Municipal Boy Scouts Held a Group Leader Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲ Expanding Publicity on Aviation Affairs The Municipal Boy Scouts, in order to expand publicity on aviation affairs, convened a group leader meeting at the Moore Hall Assembly Hall at 6 PM last night. Over 30 people attended, including Leng Xueqiao, Wang Gang, Luo Lie, Liu Yucai, and Shen Fu. Representatives from the Aviation Construction Association, including Yin Zhiling, Zhang Fan, and Xu Tong, also attended. First, Chairman Leng Xueqiao raised and discussed the various procedures for the city's aviation affairs one by one. It was decided that the publicity work would be carried out in two days, starting in the concession area and then moving to the northern and southern cities. Each road will be divided into two groups, totaling 85 teams. At the same time, they will recruit aviation members. All publicity publications will be distributed at the next group leader meeting on Friday. At that time, the group leaders recognized a total of over 1,200 group members before and after, and additional members may be added temporarily. It was also agreed on the routes for each team to set out. Finally, Huang Tiren, a representative from the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech. After about two hours, the meeting ended with joy.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Citizens on Nanjing Road Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Telephone Price Increase</p>
<p>Wang Lianfang, Chairman of the Nanjing Road Business Federation, and Ji Jiannan and Sun Wenyi, Standing Committee Members of the Citizens' District Branch, went to see the Mayor yesterday on behalf of the two associations, carrying a written petition (transcribed below) to oppose the telephone price increase. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received them and the three representatives stated their intentions and delivered the official document. Secretary-General Yu accepted the request and promised to immediately send a letter to the First Special District Bureau of Works to order the Shanghai Telephone Company to stop disconnecting lines and to restore the lines that have already been disconnected. The representatives were satisfied and left. The attached petition is as follows: One Petition Regarding the Increasingly Perverse Actions of the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Continuous Disconnection of Lines, Requesting Serious Protest and Prompt Correction of the Price Increase. We, the undersigned, hereby petition the government regarding the illegal price increase and the rash suspension of telephone service by the Shanghai Telephone Company. We have repeatedly petitioned your government to correct this and to stop the company, but the Shanghai Telephone Company, relying on the approval of the Bureau of Works, has become increasingly perverse, continuing to disconnect lines relentlessly. The people are outraged and the situation is escalating. The Bureau of Works only uses the company's one-sided interests as the absolute reason for the price increase and published an article in the newspapers on November 18 defending the company, without stopping the company from continuing to use illegal means. The Bureau of Works sees the approval of the price increase as its supreme power, compounding errors and acting arbitrarily. Although the citizens and various public organizations have made various statements and repeatedly appealed, the Bureau of Works has turned a deaf ear, allowing the citizens to be slaughtered. The citizens are unwilling to submit and have come to the association to request a transfer of their petition. We have long admired your care for the people and your understanding of the difficulties of merchants. We cannot remain silent about the suffering of the citizens in the special district. We have no choice but to send three committee members, Wang Lianfang, Ji Jiannan, and Sun Wenyi, to visit you and convey the feelings of the people. We humbly request that you grant us an audience, give us instructions, and promptly lodge a serious protest and correct the situation according to law to ensure social stability and quell public anger.</p>

<p>▲ No Standard Determined for the Inspection Result of the Level 斛</p>
<p>▲ Scheduled Another Meeting to Discuss Method</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau used to have a grain trade dispute between the Shanghai Southern Rice Carriers United Benefit Association and the grain trade. To make a fair resolution, the Bureau ordered the Local Weights and Measures Inspection Office to examine the standard平斛and米斛publicly, and determine平斛standards with a view to implementation of the system. The Society also ordered that the leveling漏斗built by the Shanghai Southern Rice Carriers United Benefit Association be examined. The test took place yesterday, thirty-first of the month, with the Inspection Office representatives and involved parties attending the gathering. The Shanghai City Rice Trade Association, Rice Store Association, Grain Association, 　Rice Association, and Food Grain Industry Association and other trade associates, and the Wu Jiang Rice Trade Association representatives attended the meeting. Many representatives attended, including Zhang Binghui, Section Chief of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Zhou Minggang, Director of the Food Division, He Yuanming, Representative of the City Party Headquarters, Lu Wenzhao, Zisheng, Zhu Zixiang, Jingzhou, Shi Hongxun Fu Qiangeng, Cai Yukun, Yan Xiaoquan, Chen Zhiqiang, and dozens of rice trade and related representatives. The Meeting was managed by Mr. Zhou Zanming and the public meter measuring began. However, due to differences in types of grains, results varied and a lack of uniformity was determined.</p>
<p>The leveling standard could not be determined. The Social Affairs Bureau is planning to summon and meet with associated industry groups to agree and determine a method. The results of the examination are as follows: Usually 5斗rice帮,海斛1斛including bags weighing an average of 100市斤and八兩; Use麻袋複斛to fill.

He returned to Shanghai yesterday at nine o'clock aboard the same ship, which is docked in the Huangpu River at Gaochangmiao.

<p>The Eighth Company of the Second Regiment of the Shanghai Municipal Security Team conducted live-fire machine gun shooting exercises at the artillery range behind Quanzhong Middle School in Rihui Port from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM yesterday. It is reported that there were over a hundred participants, supervised by training officers and the regimental commander.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Planning to Dredge Lu Jingpu, Pu Hui Tang, and Other Waterways <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee previously suggested to the Executive Yuan that the rivers and harbors in the Shanghai-Songhu area should be dredged. The suggestion stated that the rivers and harbors in the Shanghai-Songhu area are branched and originate from the Huangpu River. Vessels enter and exit with the tides. Over the years, they have become silted up. The accumulation has become so high and compounded by the effluent from factories and residents polluting the waterways. Near the city, the stench is unbearable; in the countryside, drinking water is scarce. If immediate repairs are not made, there is a risk of complete blockage. Due to limited financial resources, it is necessary to selectively dredge key waterways. Besides the section of the Dachang-Miaohang Jianbangpu, which is the shallowest, the most important tributaries are the Lu Jingpu and Shenjin Port in Zhabei, and the Puhui Tang and Rihui Port in West Shanghai. These waterways connect to the concessions and are vital to the area's appearance. Dredging Lu Jingpu should be connected to the Taoxi Sitang to reach Yunzao Creek, so that the river system is fully connected. Dredging Puhui Tang should include filling in Zhaojiabang to eliminate the source of factory wastewater. The cost of the two river projects is estimated at 200,000 yuan, to be allocated by the committee. The task of filling in the waterway should be assigned to the Shanghai Municipal Government, as the filled land can be sold to cover the cost of digging ditches and transporting earth. The Executive Yuan deemed the committee's proposal feasible and ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government and Jiangsu Provincial Government to assist in its implementation. The Municipal Government has also received orders to instruct the Public Works Bureau to comply.</p>

<p>▲Attending the Opening Ceremony of the Bank of Communications Branch ▲Touring the Scenic Spots of the Three Towns of Wuhan Since returning to Shanghai from Dalian last year, Mr. Chuan Xiao'an has stayed at home, avoiding public life. In mid-July, he suddenly traveled west to Hankou, causing much speculation. When someone interviewed Mr. Chuan at Jinhuisitang yesterday, he replied that his trip to Hankou was to attend the opening ceremony of the Bank of Communications Hankou branch and to tour the scenic spots of the Three Towns of Wuhan. While in Wuhan, he visited General Chiang Kai-shek at the Yihua Village residence for a forty-minute conversation. The discussion focused on the commercial situation and market conditions in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan. Chiang Kai-shek believes that the establishment of Bank of Communications branches in Nanjing and Hankou will promote market prosperity and benefit industry and commerce, and he expressed his appreciation and awarded the Hankou branch the plaque “[Utilizing Resources for the Benefit of the People]” and the Nanjing branch the plaque “[Economic Pioneering],” demonstrating his dedication to promoting industry and commerce.

<h3 id="e113">Petition to Exempt Ship Tickets from Stamp Tax <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>▲Representatives Sent to Petition the Stamp Tax Bureau Yesterday ▲Submitting a Request to the Ministry of Finance to Order the Bureau to Cancel the Stamp Tax Jiangsu Stamp Tax Branch Bureau Chief Xu Zhicheng, under orders, is handling the addition of stamp tax to steamship passenger tickets. The Bureau announced to all ticket agencies that starting December 1st, all steamship passenger tickets must have stamps affixed. As most of the steamship tickets sold are for foreign companies, enforcement is bound to cause difficulties. They jointly requested the Ministry of Finance for exemption. Yesterday, the Ticket Industry Association and the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association held a meeting to discuss a joint request to the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Six Articles of Ship Ticket Stamp Regulations The six articles of ship ticket stamp regulations are as follows: 1. Various accounting books used on ships must have stamps affixed at a value of 1 jiao. 2. Steamship passenger tickets priced at less than 1 yuan must have a stamp affixed at a value of 1 fen, and those priced over 1 yuan must have a stamp affixed at a value of 2 fen, with the value increasing accordingly. 3. Steamship ticket offices and travel agencies that sell steamship tickets must affix stamps in accordance with the regulations. 4. When affixing a stamp, the stamp must be stamped with a seal or signature at the designated location. 5. Stamps that have been affixed must not be removed and reused. 6. There are five types of stamps: 1 fen (blue), 2 fen (yellow), 1 jiao (red), 5 jiao (purple), and 1 yuan (blue). All are stamped with the words "Jiangsu Shanghai South District." Steamship tickets will also have a special "Steamship Ticket Only" stamp to distinguish them.</p>
<p>▲Representatives Petition The China Shipping Mutual Aid Association and the Ticket Industry Association believe that steamship ticket stamps for foreign steamships present a particular difficulty. They held a second meeting yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to discuss the matter. In addition to deciding to petition the Ministry of Finance for exemption, they also dispatched representatives Zhu Ruiqing and Wang Bingquan (Mutual Aid Association) and Wu Zhaochu and Liu Hanguang (Ticket Industry Association) to the Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau to petition. The four representatives arrived at the Bureau at 4:00 PM. Secretary Zhu of the Bureau received them and stated that he would relay their request to the Director, asking that the implementation of steamship ticket stamps be temporarily suspended until the Ministry of Finance has issued a response, and that inspectors not be dispatched to avoid misunderstandings. The representatives then departed, feeling that the outcome was satisfactory.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Ministry of Finance The China Shipping Mutual Aid Association and the Ticket Industry Association yesterday sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Regarding the request to exempt steamship passenger tickets from stamp tax in order to alleviate commercial difficulties and maintain the shipping industry, we respectfully request your review and approval. According to a report from the business directors of various steamships that are members of this association: "According to a notice from the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Branch Bureau (omitted), six articles of stamp regulations are attached. We believe that the stamp tax is a national tax and should be complied with. However, last year we suffered from floods, and this year we have been affected by war. Commerce has been severely damaged. Ordinary passengers are unable to pay the ticket price, let alone the additional stamp tax. In addition, foreign companies have not been required to affix stamps to steamship tickets for decades, and to implement this suddenly is bound to cause difficulties and be rejected." Therefore, we respectfully submit this letter and request that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, requesting exemption in order to maintain the shipping industry." The above-mentioned statement from the business directors is true and reflects the difficulties in affixing stamps to steamship passenger tickets. Therefore, we respectfully submit this letter and request that you consider the difficulties faced by merchants and grant exemption from stamp tax for steamship passenger tickets in order to maintain the shipping industry. [Anxious and waiting for orders], we respectfully submit this letter to Finance Minister Song Ziwen.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Appeal to Waive Business Tax <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>▲If One Moves All Will Perish The Native Cloth Industry Association of Shanghai sent letters to the National Government and the Ministries of Finance and Industry yesterday, requesting that the collection of business tax on native cloth be stopped. "[On behalf of the request, instruct the Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Provincial Finance Departments to investigate and order the business tax collectors to exempt native cloth from business tax in order to create a precedent." The National Manual Native Cloth Business Tax Exemption case was mainly initiated by the Association, who expressed that the poor people suffered. The case was compiled and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Zou Guofu's decision was that in December of the 20th year, all provinces and cities received instructions from the Executive Yuan one after another that native cloth business tax should be exempt. What happened was that the business tax collectors in the second district of Zhejiang Province, in disregard of the established case and the order of the ministry, and without regard to the people's difficulties, added business tax. With the administrative orders in hand, the tax collectors did not care about it. The Zhejiang Association has already telegraphed to the Zhejiang provincial authorities, requesting a halt. It was reported to the industry by Chongming and Qidong counties in Jiangsu that the business tax collectors there had already followed suit and forced the payment of taxes by police force. In the Fujian province report, Ninde Sanbu and other places have also had the intent to re-impose native cloth tax and impose harsh taxes. The association has asked and stated. The case of all provinces and cities is not requested to be halted, and the business tax collector of the provincial district makes inappropriate remarks and harasses the lives of the people. Since manual hand-woven native cloth was made tax-free, Fang Qi Chaoye Shang, the next teacher's code of practice, published clothes to save the country, and made a grand wish to strengthen the country and expand people's livelihoods. The two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are native cloth producing areas, and the three northeastern provinces are the most prosperous selling areas, followed by Min and Guangdong. Since the Japanese army invaded Liaoning on September 18, the goods from the three provinces have been transported for a long time and have been suspended. In the battle zone, houses were destroyed, equipment was lost, and local sages did their best to request assistance from the government and all walks of life. It is not the time to solve the difficulties by building and setting up equipment and lending capital. The people in the war-affected leased area have suffered a lot. The merchants are in distress, and everyone knows that. The business tax officers are growing up in China, are responsible for patriotism, are tax officers today, and will be local businessmen after retirement. Why have to harass the lives of the people and do things that are not in line with the interests of the people. The city of Shanghai does not have any problems. In case it is affected by the sales area, all the houses will be destroyed. The merchants followed the orders. Because of the government's advocacy of domestic products, a special permanent tax exemption has been made. The above is the faith of the country and the people's livelihood. It seems that silence has been made. At the time of planting rice, the ministry sent personnel to express condolences. This is for the reason that the departments concerned have considered the idea of collecting money. The tax collection movement in Fujian Province has the suggestion of changing the phase of yuan money, which is to request that the government department of the ministry of finance and industry immediately put an end to it in order to create a broad-minded society. The above is respectfully presented to the Administrative Council of the Ministry of Finance, the Kuomintang National Government and the Department of Industry, and the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association.</p>

<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation received a telegram yesterday from the Lanzhou station, saying that the No. 5 test flight plane had returned to Suzhou at 5:15 pm yesterday after receiving confirmation that it had arrived in Dihua.

<h3 id="e116">Two Groups from Anhui Sent a Letter to President Yu <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲Opposing the Rice Tax The Anhui Association of Shanghai and the Anhui Society opposed the rice tax and sent a letter to Yu, President of the Supervisory Yuan, saying: [Respected President], Since the [Anhui] province has experienced changes over the years, in addition to the damage caused by bandits, the province has also suffered from floods. The province's coffers are exhausted. The people's suffering is difficult to describe. It is fortunate that the Western Anhui Red Bandits were gradually suppressed. The lives of the people of the survivors were slightly revived. Unexpectedly, the provincial government disregards the people's lives, and under the pretext of managing food, it has unilaterally restored the rice tax that was introduced by Chen Tiaoyuan and was ordered by the Central Government to be abolished. Twenty-four checkpoints have been set up in Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Dashengguan, and other ports. It is stipulated that the tax for transporting rice by sailboat is 4 jiao per stone, 6 jiao for wheel transport, and 3 jiao for miscellaneous grains. The amount of tax is several times higher than the Jin. According to the total calculation, the direct loss to the people of the whole province should reach more than 10 million. How can the people of Anhui bear this? Moreover, rice is the main export of Anhui province. The average annual export is more than 10 million stones. The rural economy depends on this, and the province's financial situation is regulated by this. This year's harvest is plentiful, and the value of rice is falling sharply due to oversupply. Bankruptcies are unbearable. Now, the government is building barriers and imposing heavy taxes. The outlet for rice will be completely blocked, directly promoting the collapse of the rural economy and indirectly increasing the panic of the industrial and commercial sectors. The harm is extremely serious and difficult to estimate. Since the central government downsized the army, it has clearly announced that all similar Jin agencies are not allowed to be established. The whole country is under the banner of the Kuomintang, and there is no room for the existence of Jin under disguise. In order to uphold the prestige of the Central Government, respect the party and state discipline, and maintain the interests of their fellow villagers, the Association is unable to recognize the illegal and harmful rice tax levied by the provincial government. In addition to submitting petitions to various departments of the Central Government, we have prepared a letter and sent representatives Hu Peiru and Ke Nan to submit it. The letter requests that [you] protect the people's livelihood and uphold justice. When Chen Tiaoyuan, the former chairman of Anhui, created the rice tax, [you] submitted an impeachment to the court. The Central Government then ordered the abolition of the tax, and the people of Anhui were deeply grateful. Now the provincial government of Anhui is re-opening the old case without authorization, in contempt of the Central Government and in violation of laws and regulations. Compared with Chen Tiaoyuan, their crimes are several times greater. We dare to ask [you] to sympathize with the people's difficulties and severely impeach them in order to eliminate the wicked and maintain discipline. We also request that representatives Hu and Lei be received and instructed. [We are] anxious and waiting for orders. [Sincerely], The Anhui Association of Shanghai and the Anhui Society.</p>

Sugisaka is scheduled to hold the Rear Admiral rank assumption ceremony at the Rokusan Club in Hongkou this morning, and the Rear Admiral's flag-raising ceremony will be held at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<p>▲ Marine Corps Returns Home. The second battalion and the quartermaster corps of the fourth battalion, totaling 300 soldiers of the Japanese Marine Corps' second rotation back to their home country, boarded the Qingdao transport ship at Osaka Wharf at 9:30 yesterday morning. It set sail for Japan at 10:00 AM. Japanese female high school students sang the Omura Sailor's Song and a song about Japanese planes bombing Hangzhou, their hearts never forgetting to insult us. Additionally, four torpedo boats from the 15th team are scheduled to leave Shanghai at 2:00 PM this afternoon, returning to the Yokosuka Naval Base.</p>
<p>▲ Urakaze Deployed to Wuhu. Recently, a large amount of miscellaneous grains from the Yangtze River are being transported to the East, especially rapeseeds from Wuhu.

<p>A Scene of a Love Tragedy</p>
<h3 id="e118">Li Minghui Testifies in Court <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Audience... not enthusiastic. Judge instructs Li... [No need to appear in court next time] ▲ Did Zheng Guoyou have the power to kill Feng Deqian? ▲ The chauffeur then participated in the conspiracy. Wang Nengxiang's photo sent to Hong Kong for the convicts to identify. The notorious young lady Li Minghui's love tragedy, which was staged in Hong Kong this spring, caused a sensation. Her fiancé, Feng Deqian, died on the spot, while her lagging lover, Zheng Guoyou, was sentenced to death by the British judge in Hong Kong for inciting murder and is still appealing. As for the young lady, she returned to Shanghai after the Hong Kong case was decided and now resides at No. 8, Nanyang Road, West District, Public Concession. However, the actual murderer of Feng, Wang Nengxiang from Tongzhou, fled from Hong Kong to Shanghai the day after the murder and hid at No. 72, Xiexu Branch Road, Nanshi. After being apprehended by Chief Detective Lu Liankui, Deputy Detective Liu Shaokui, etc., Hong Kong officials heard the news and sent personnel to Shanghai to request extradition to the First Special District. The local court of the First Special District, considering that although the case occurred in Hong Kong, Wang Nengxiang is Chinese and thus should not be handed over to British officials for trial, ordered the police to detain Wang for investigation and prosecution. It has been several months since then. All the evidence has been obtained by the police from the British authorities in Hong Kong, and the only crucial witness, Li Minghui, has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Therefore, Qian Hongye, the Chief of the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, scheduled a public trial at the First Tribunal at 2:00 PM yesterday, issuing a summons ordering Li Minghui to appear in court to testify. However, because few people knew about it, the audience was not enthusiastic. The trial commenced as follows: Li Minghui arrived at the court at 2:10 PM, accompanied by West Detective Huier, in car No. 3641. She entered the court and sat on the witness stand. Li's complexion was radiant, and her hair gleamed. She wore a fashionable cheongsam covered with a black woolen coat and brown silk stockings with brown leather shoes. Three gorgeously dressed young ladies were sitting opposite her, and Li nodded to them frequently, presumably they were her girlfriends. At 2:30 PM, Judge Qian and the court clerk ascended the bench and ordered Wang Nengxiang to be brought to the court. After questioning his age and origin, the police lawyer Ru Bao'yi stood up and described the occurrence of the case and the process of the investigation, stating that the case was being prosecuted against the defendant in accordance with Article 282, Clause 1 of the Criminal Law. Although the location of the incident was in Hong Kong, the defendant was arrested in Shanghai and is Chinese, so it was decided to prosecute in your esteemed court.</p>
<p>Feng Deqian, on the afternoon of March 24th at 8:30 PM, accompanied by Li Minghui, was passing through the Sanguang Road area in Hong Kong. The defendant and Ah Guan, who is still at large, each holding a pistol, waited there and shot Feng in the back. Feng fell to the ground in response to the gunshot, and the murderer fled the scene. The Hong Kong police immediately sent Feng to the hospital and began an investigation. Later, a live ammunition pistol was found at the entrance of No. 5, Wansongfang. It was determined that the wound Feng received was indeed caused by this gun. The next day, an examination of Feng's remains revealed that he had been fatally shot in the heart and lungs. However, the reason for his murder was still unknown at this time. The investigation continued until April 4th when</p>
<p>Zheng Guoyou was suspected of inciting the murder. Zheng was detained, and on the 20th, the chauffeur Xu Yongzhen was also arrested, and a pistol with three rounds of live ammunition was found in Xu's home. According to Xu's confession, the pistol found in his home was the one wielded by Ah Guan. At this point, it was proven that the gun found at the entrance of No. 5 was the one wielded by Wang Nengxiang. Xu was interrogated by Hong Kong officials on June 27th, 28th, and 29th, and he confessed in great detail. From the study of these confessions, it was learned that Zheng Guoyou had a feud with Feng. Zheng initially wanted to kill Feng but did not have the power to do so, so he conspired with the chauffeur Xu Yongzhen, and Zheng's chauffeur Liu Aqing also participated in the conspiracy. Zheng then asked Liu to find someone to commit the murder. Liu found Wang Nengxiang, Ah Guan, and Dong, etc. Currently, except for Zheng, who has been sentenced, Xu and Liu have also been detained by Hong Kong officials. Before the murder, Liu Aqing devised a way for Wang Nengxiang and others to identify Feng Deqian. Then Dong handed a pistol to Wang Nengxiang, and Xu Yongzhen also handed a gun to Ah Guan and rented a room at No. 17, Wansongfang Clothing Store as a base. On the nights of March 17th and 18th, at 7:00 PM, Wang Nengxiang waited on Sanguang Road. However, Feng drove by in a car, and Wang did not have a chance to shoot. The night before, Ah Guan was added, and each of them carried a pistol to the same location. When Feng and Li arrived, Wang fired a shot at Feng and fled to the entrance of No. 5, Wansongfang, abandoning the gun and returning empty-handed. Ah Guan did not fire, so he still carried the gun back and initially hid it at No. 17, and then Xu took it home. The gun is still in Hong Kong. Wang's gun and the confessions of each person have all been retrieved to Shanghai. After they achieved their murder goal, they vacated the house at No. 17 the next day. The Hong Kong police then learned that the house was a base for criminals and began their investigation from there, and the defendants were arrested one by one. Now, for</p>
<p>the sake of caution, the police have sent Wang Nengxiang's photo to Hong Kong for the convicts in Hong Kong to identify whether this Wang Nengxiang is the Wang Nengxiang they confessed to. No reply has been received yet. If the defendant is indeed the Wang Nengxiang confessed by the Hong Kong convicts, then this case is undoubtedly true and the crime is deserved. After the statement, Judge Qian summoned Li Minghui to the court to inquire about the circumstances of the incident and the Hong Kong officials' trial of the defendants. After Li gave a brief reply, Judge Qian questioned the defendant Wang Nengxiang. However, Wang claimed that he did not know anything, no matter what he was asked in court. Judge Qian then instructed, "Your photo has now been sent to Hong Kong. If the convicts in Hong Kong do not know you, then your claim of ignorance may be excusable. Otherwise, it will be difficult for you to deny it. Therefore, I will now postpone the case until I receive a reply from Hong Kong before conducting another trial." After the instruction, the court adjourned, and the defendant was taken back to the police station for detention. Li Minghui also drove away. Before leaving, the court instructed her that there was no need to appear in court next time.</p>

He bled profusely and died instantly. The two murderers, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, fled towards Avenue Edward VII. The patrol police arrived and transported the body to Tongren Fuyuantang to await the court's examination this morning.

<h3 id="e120">How Can a Child Be Born in Eight Months? <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>丨Wang Ruying Has No Answer丨 (Grandson Is Already Four Years Old) Asking for Marriage... It's a Joke. Mao Lianqing Accused of [Fraud, Adultery, Medicine]</p>
<p>Mao Lianqing, a native of Ningbo and a former shareholder of the Mao Quantai Lumber Store on Sichuan Road, was recently sued by a Shanghai woman, Wang Ruying, through a lawyer, for fraud, adultery, abandonment, and other crimes. The entire complaint has been published in the newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zhen of the First Special District Court opened the Second Criminal Tribunal for questioning. Mao and his agent, lawyer Dai Ji'en, arrived in court on time. First, Wang Ruying claimed that she met the defendant in July of last year and had physical relations with him in early August. They then cohabited at No. 7, Datongli, Baker Road, and gave birth to a son in April of this year. Initially, the defendant repeatedly proposed to me and gave me a wedding ring. However, after the birth of the child, he abandoned me. Therefore, I presented the wedding ring as evidence. The rest of her statement was largely consistent with the complaint, so it is omitted. Judge Wu then asked that given she had relations in August of last year, how could a child be born in April of this year, which is only eight months? Wang was speechless. Mao Lianqing stated that the plaintiff was a prostitute whom he met through a pimp in early August of last year, on the ninth or tenth day, at the Datong Hotel, and had relations with her. He had been to No. 7, Datongli, Baker Road, once, but did not stay overnight. The house was not rented by him. The child born to the plaintiff is not his. He only had intercourse with her once, and it is impossible for such a coincidence to occur. Even the dates she mentioned are inconsistent. The plaintiff's claim that he repeatedly proposed to her is a joke because his grandson is already four years old. How could he propose to someone else again? However, he admitted to having a fling once while out for fun. He denied giving the wedding ring. At this point, the court ordered the start of the debate. After the lawyers for both parties debated, Judge Wu announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for next Wednesday afternoon. It is reported that the plaintiff is a former prostitute from the Xiu Yunge brothel in Huileli, ranked fourth. However, she has now left this life of selling smiles in the brothel.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Hunting Report from the Tonglu Hunting Association <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲ Unfortunately, hindered by wind and rain, the gains were not much ▲ The trophy was won by Shen Tu Zhen. A group of more than ten people from the Shanghai Hunting Association took the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train at 6:50 PM on the 19th and arrived at Nanxing Station at around 11:00 PM. They were received by Shu Quanbao and Xia Weiru, two students from the Hangzhou branch of Zhejiang University, and stayed at the Tongshang Hotel. The next morning, they took the Jiangxing fast boat along the upper reaches of the Qiantang River to Zhaixi and disembarked to hunt along the way. At around 5:00 PM, they arrived at Gangjia, using the Fenggang Township Office as their camp. The next day, they hunted pheasants and rabbits in the plains for a day, preparing food for the mountain climb, to stretch their muscles. On the 22nd, they set off at dawn, crossing Huangyangling and Hongjia Village, and arrived at Shangnan Diaoyu at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. Surrounded by towering mountains and ridges, it was a natural hunting area. They stayed at the home of a hunter surnamed Wang, and pre-arranged an old hunter named Haigou as their guide. This man was over sixty years old, walked on the mountains as if on flat ground, and could identify animal tracks. The next day, they went up the mountain with dogs and guns, climbing the cliffs. At noon, they shot a large mountain goat weighing more than 300 pounds. Its head and mane covered the ground, resembling black moss. In the afternoon, it rained, so they rested. The next morning, it was still raining. In the afternoon, it cleared up slightly. The members were in high spirits and took the opportunity to enter the mountain again, capturing another roe deer weighing more than 100 pounds. As the day was short and it was getting late, they sounded the horn and returned. On the 25th, it was windy and rainy, with clouds and fog filling the valley, knowing that it would not clear up in a day or two. The members were all running out of vacation time and had no choice but to decide to return. At 8:00 AM, they braved the rain and moved forward, passing Niufengling, which was about 2,000 feet high. It took four hours to walk from the foot to the top. The sound of the stream was like thunder, the sound of the wind was like a tiger, and the clouds and fog obscured the view. The mud and water submerged their ankles. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, they arrived at Shen'ao, the home of member Shen Tu Zhen, and stayed overnight. The next morning, they took a boat to Dongzi and returned to Zhakou, taking the 3:15 train and arriving in Shanghai at 9:30 PM on Saturday. This trip was delayed by wind and rain, resulting in only two wild animals and thirty or forty chickens and rabbits being caught. The animals have now been entrusted to the Commercial Press to be made into models and will soon be displayed at the Hongfa Company on Nanjing Road for enthusiasts to appreciate. It is also known that the trophy set by the association this time was won by Shen Tu Zhen. Various photos and detailed records will be published in the newspapers in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Entering Matrilineal Marriage to Defraud Wealth <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>〓One Action Achieves Both Son-in-law and Wife, Combining Europe and the Roundness of Children〓▲Who Knows... Entering Matrilineal Marriage Is Just a Pretext to Defraud Wealth. Yao Yunzhang, a local from No. 10, the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Lafayette Road, French Concession, and his wife, Ms. Yao, because they were middle-aged and had no son, fortunately had a daughter in their middle age, named A'mei, who was of marriageable age and had a beautiful appearance, but her cross-eyedness was a flaw. Yao, with only one precious daughter, did not promise A'mei to anyone, preparing to find a son-in-law to rely on for life in the future. Cao Zishan, Qian Yousheng, and others introduced Wang Chengli, a local who worked as a chauffeur for a Westerner at No. 257, Anhe Temple Road, French Concession, who was willing to enter into matrilineal marriage with the Yao family. So, on June 10th of this year, he formally entered matrilineal marriage and changed his name to Yao Yongfa. Unexpectedly, not long after the marriage, disputes arose between the two sides, and their love broke down. Yao Yunzhang, Ms. Yao, and Yao A'mei then hired lawyer Gan Lin to file a complaint with the First Special District Court against Yao Yongfa (i.e., Wang Chengli) and seven others, including matchmakers Cao Zishan and Qian Yousheng, and introducers Lu Bianying, Tang Jingsheng, Wang Zhiwei, and Wu Ziliang, alleging collusion to enter into matrilineal marriage to defraud wealth, with attached civil suits. The complaint stated that Yao Yunzhang and Ms. Yao, being old and childless, in June of this year, through matchmakers Cao and Qian, and introducers Lu, Tang, Wang, and Wu, recruited Yao Yongfa, i.e., Wang Chengli, as their son-in-law, and matched him with their third plaintiff, A'mei, as her husband. On June 10th, he formally entered matrilineal marriage, changing his name and surname, and establishing a written agreement. On that day, they gathered guests and held a grand banquet, achieving both son-in-law and wife in one action, celebrating the double joy of the event, combining joy and the roundness of children, and hoping to start a family and continue the family line from then on. Who knew that Yao Yongfa's intention was to obtain wealth. Within a few days of entering the family, he falsely claimed to A'mei that he had a former lover who was now pregnant. If he did not abort her, he would be implicated, demanding 50 yuan for abortion fees. A'mei, unaware of his deception, privately paid him on June 23rd. Only a few days later, he claimed that although the former lover's fetus had been aborted, the roots still needed to be removed, otherwise it would eventually cause trouble, demanding more than 100 yuan for breakup fees. A'mei, still believing that the matter was real, paid him again on July 2nd. Before entering matrilineal marriage, he claimed that both of his parents were deceased and that he had no relatives. However, after A'mei paid the money, he suddenly claimed that his mother in his hometown had passed away and that he needed to repay a debt of 380 yuan on her behalf. A'mei, seeing that his desires were insatiable and unable to pay any more, finally told her parents about the situation. When Yao Yongfa was questioned, he realized that his scheme had been exposed and left on July 22nd. The plaintiffs invited the original matchmakers and introducers to reason with him, but to no avail. In this situation, it can be seen that the defendants are indeed colluding to enter matrilineal marriage in order to defraud wealth, which is a violation of Article 363, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law. It is requested that they be investigated and punished according to the law, and that the defrauded 150 yuan be returned, and that 500 yuan be compensated for the expenses incurred during the matrilineal marriage. In addition, 10,000 yuan is requested for A'mei's consolation money. The court accepted the complaint and, on the previous day, ordered Chinese police officer Guo Xiangyao to summon the defendants, but they could not be found. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Junqing presided over the Ninth Criminal Tribunal for the trial. All the plaintiffs arrived. Their agent, lawyer Gan Lin, stated that since the defendants had not been summoned today, the plaintiffs would designate them for summons next time. Judge Zhang instructed that the case be adjourned for seven days to summon the defendants to court for questioning.</p>

<p>▲Tang Rongzhi and Gu Jide Appealed. Tang Rongzhi, a native of Jiangbei, lived in Shihuayao and worked as a rickshaw puller. His wife, Tang Yuan, was of a promiscuous nature and had an affair with Gu Jide, a fellow worker. Tang was weak by nature and allowed everything, so the two husbands lived in the same house, known as the big and small husbands. However, the woman was still not satisfied, so she strangled Tang Rongzhi to death and abandoned his body next to the railway on Zhongshan Road. After the court's investigation and identification, his nephew Tang Yuanli and others identified and reported the case. The woman and Gu were detained by the local court and prosecuted. After repeated inquiries and debates, Judge Yang Xingqian opened the court yesterday and announced the verdict, bringing the woman and Gu to the court and instructing them that they were both guilty of premeditated murder and should be sentenced to death. However, they were specially granted leniency and each sentenced to life imprisonment. Unexpectedly, the convicts were not satisfied with the verdict and were allowed to appeal.

<h3 id="e129">Payment of Fine <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Temporary Receipt Discovered ▲Weng Bingchun Suspected of Corruption ▲Three Key Witnesses Failed to Appear. Weng Bingchun, a local in his twenties, worked as a clerk in the Second Special District Local Court in Shanghai, working in the Criminal Execution Office. Before October 20th, because the receipt clerk Lu Nanping was absent due to business, Weng was transferred from the Documents Section to temporarily replace Lu. On the morning of the 24th of that month, three people went to the receipt office to find Weng to pay the fine of 500 yuan for the opium case defendant Min Zaide. Because Weng was not there, they did not meet him and went back. In the afternoon, the three people went to the receipt office again and met with Weng, paid the money, and Weng issued a receipt. While holding the receipt at the receiving clerk's office and requesting the judge to issue a release warrant, the three people who paid the money were waiting at the receipt office when the director of the receipt office discovered that the payers held a temporary receipt for 400 yuan issued by Weng Bingchun, with Weng's name stamp on it. Feng thought that since the party concerned had paid the fine and a formal receipt had been issued by the court, why was there another temporary receipt, and the amount was also different. He believed that the procedure was inconsistent and would damage the court's reputation. He immediately detained the temporary receipt. When Weng arrived, he questioned him about why he issued a temporary receipt when a formal receipt had already been issued. Weng stammered and took the receipt back, tore it up, and threw it away. Director Feng, believing that Weng had committed corruption, reported it to the court president, who dismissed Weng and transferred him to the procuratorate. After summoning the payers and witnesses to court for investigation, it was concluded that Weng had indeed committed corruption. He was ordered to post bail and was prosecuted according to the law by the same-level court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Chaozuo and Procurator Deng Baosu specially opened the Second Criminal Tribunal for the trial. The defendant arrived with his defense lawyer. First, Feng Bangyan, the director of the receipt office, stated the circumstances of discovering the defendant issuing the temporary receipt and reporting it to the court president. Then, because the key witnesses, Min Zaide, Wang Delin, and the other three people who paid the money, did not appear, the official briefly questioned the defendant Weng Bingchun and ordered him to continue to post bail and reschedule the trial after the witnesses were summoned. Because the original guarantor requested to withdraw the guarantee, he was ordered to find a suitable guarantor, otherwise he would be detained. Then, the defense lawyer temporarily provided a guarantee that the defendant would submit a guarantee within two days. Then the court adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received instructions from the Jiangsu Industrial Department that since the floods in Su Province and the Shanghai Incident, the vitality had not recovered and many people had lost their jobs and were displaced.

<p>Ye Chuanzong, in a state of desperation, ingested poison. Ye Chuanzong, a native of Ningbo, was 37 years old and resided at No. 60, Tongchunfang, Zhejiang Road, Six Malu, Shanghai. He also operated the Shengchang and Shenchang steel bed shops at Six Malu and Daigouqiao. Business was very good a year ago, but recently, due to the increasing number of businesses engaged in this industry, his shop's business plummeted. However, Ye still tried to revitalize it, so he still ordered goods from a certain copper workshop, signing checks for payment of 1,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, the steel workshop went to cash the check on the due date, but it was dishonored. He returned to negotiate with Ye, who knew he was in the wrong but couldn't come up with such a large sum of money at the moment. In a moment of desperation, he secretly ingested opium to commit suicide at around 1 a.m. yesterday morning. His family discovered this and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, due to an overdose of poison, he died at 2 p.m. yesterday. The hospital reported this to the police station, which transferred the body to the mortuary for an autopsy. The court will be requested to conduct an examination this morning.</p>

Since all personal activities are closely linked to a real society, naturally, all problems and doubts are caused by a society. Problems should be discussed and doubts should be answered. Everyone here has the right to raise everything they doubt to society, and at the same time, everyone has the obligation to discuss problems and solve doubts.

Xiaguang also had many opportunities, but their shots missed. What could they do? In the first half, Chongde won by a large margin of 23-5.</p>
<p>▲Xiaguang's Hard Fight At the beginning of the afternoon match, Xiaguang showed signs of a turnaround, scoring four or five consecutive goals and gradually closing the gap to only six or seven points.

<p>Daxia University Xiaguang Women's Basketball Team</p>
<p>▲Southeast Wins Over Junior Level The Junior Level team's performance is mediocre compared to the other teams. As soon as they took the court, the difference in skill was obvious. Southeast did whatever they wanted without any obstruction. Pan Yueying was especially unstoppable. The first and second quarters were somewhat manageable, but in the later stages, they were completely helpless. As a result, Southeast won 37-9. ▲Southeast Fouls▲ Junior Level Fouls Pan Yueying, Forward, 0 fouls, 29 points A.

In the four quarters, Liangjiang B was only able to compete with the Red Team in the third quarter. At that time, the Red Team was clearly complacent, while Liangjiang B aggressively advanced, resulting in a 4-4 tie. As a result, the Red Team won 25-11.

Although Liangjiang A's technique was skilled, they were not very successful, leading by only 6-5. In the second quarter, Liangjiang A had a particularly impressive performance. The forwards' shooting was like taking something out of a bag, and the defense of the guards was like a golden city and iron walls, winning 8-0. In the third quarter, the Blue Team's morale rose sharply, reversing the situation with a 6-4 lead. The victory in the fourth quarter returned to Liangjiang A. In the end, the better team is certain to win. As a result, Liangjiang A won 25-14. Liangjiang A Fouls ▲Blue Team Fouls Chen Rongming, Forward, 0 fouls, 6 points J.

<h3 id="e168">[Boxing][Wrestling][Fencing][Bayonet] Exam (Part 1) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>(Former Director of Training and Editing at the Jiangsu Provincial National Arts Institute) Jin Yiming</p>
<p>I recently learned that the Central National Arts Examination will be held next year simultaneously with the National Games. Upon examining the Central National Arts Institute's regulations, [Boxing], [Wrestling], [Fencing], and [Bayonet] are listed as the main examination subjects, along with subjects like the history of national arts. Here, I will describe the origins of these four disciplines, which may serve as a helpful reference for those studying national arts.</p>
<p>(1) Boxing Exam</p>
<p>The meaning of the two characters "[Boxing]": "Bo" means to capture, referring to grasping with the fingers. "Bo" also means to strike, referring to punching with the fist. The "Han Shu Yi Wen Zhi" (Book of Han, Treatise on Literature) records six chapters on "hand boxing," but I have not seen this book. Some say it is included in the "Si Ku Quan Shu" (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries). Zhou Lianggong of the Qing Dynasty said that "[Bai Da]" (barehanded fighting) is the same as today's "[Shou Bo]" (hand boxing), also known as "[Duan Da]" (short striking). Therefore, among the eighteen martial arts, "[Bai Da]" is the last, clearly indicating that it does not involve holding any weapons. This refers to "[Shou Bo]" and "[Bai Da]," both involving stances where punches and kicks can be used, as recorded in the Spring and Autumn Annals about Ju Ying and Lu Jiyou, who were skilled at wrestling, agreeing to dismiss soldiers on the spot (immediately), which is hand-to-hand combat. The Zuo Zhuan mentions that Duke Jing of Jin dreamed of wrestling with the ruler of Chu. Also, in the "Records of the Grand Historian," the biography of Guan Fu mentions drinking with Chang Le Wei Fu, who became drunk, and the two fought, with Fu striking.</p>
<p>The "[Boxing]" stipulated by the Central National Arts Institute is different from Western "[Boxing]," which uses hands but prohibits the use of legs. Being able to use both fists and feet aligns completely with "[San Da]" (free fighting), "[Fang Dui]" (sparring), "[Bai Da]," and "[Shou Bo]," except that only a glove is added to the fist. Refer to Article 4, Item 3 of the "[National Defense Regulations]," which clearly states that hitting the opponent's vital areas counts as "[scoring points]." Vital areas include: (1) [Punching] Areas: the front and left/right sides of the head, the brow ridge, the heart, and the liver. (2) [Kicking] Areas: the abdomen and the calf.</p>
<p>Appendix: Alternative names for [Boxing]:</p>
<p>One name is "[Bian]". The biography of Gan Yanshou in the "[Han Shu]" states that Yanshou was tested in "[Bian]" as a Qimen guard. Meng Kang notes that "[Bian]" means "[Shou Bo]."</p>
<p>Another name is mentioned in the Records of Emperor Ai of Han: "At that time, he reviewed [Archery] and [Martial Arts]." Su Lin notes that "[Shou Bo] is [Jiao Di], while [Wei Xi] is divided into [Boxing], [Archery], and [Wrestling]."</p>
<p>(2) Wrestling</p>
<p>[Wrestling] originated from [Jiao Di]. Examining the two characters "[Jiao Di]," the "Shu Yi Zhi" (Records of Strange Things) says that it means butting heads with horns. During the time of the Yellow Emperor, Chi You wore horns on his head and fought against Xuanyuan (the Yellow Emperor) by butting people with his horns, which no one could withstand. This is called "[Jiao Di]." The old music of Jizhou includes the Chi You play, where people, in pairs or groups of three, wear horns on their heads and butt each other, which is the "[Jiao Di]" play. Later, any game of winning with horns was generally called "[Jiao Di]," losing its original meaning. The "Han Ji" (Annals of the Han Dynasty) records that in the third year of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, a "[Jiao Di]" performance was held to entertain foreign envoys, and people within three hundred li all admired it. This use of "[Jiao Di]" as a game of winning with horns began with wearing horns, and the name became synonymous with resisting and butting. The "Wen Wu Lin Jiu Shi" (Old Affairs of Wulin) mentions that the modern game of "[Jiao Li]" (strength competition) is called "Shuai Jiao" (wrestling). In the Song Dynasty, it was called "[Xiang Pu]" (sumo). Therefore, "[Jiao Di]" has evolved from "[Xiang Pu]" to "[Guan Jiao]" (Chinese wrestling). I believe that "[Xiang Pu]" contains the meaning of fist techniques and is different from "[Jiao Di]," which focuses solely on strength. "[Xiang Pu]" combines skills, while the "Li Ji" (Book of Rites) mentions that in the last month of winter, the emperor would order generals to practice martial arts, including [Archery], [Chariot Driving], and [Strength Competition]. Originally, it was said that Qin Er Shi (the second emperor of the Qin Dynasty) held a performance of "[Jiao Di]" and "[Actor]" games in Ganquan Palace. Later, Emperor Wu of Han favored this game, which is today's sumo. It is clear that "[Jiao Di]" existed in ancient times and was not adopted from foreign techniques.</p>
<p>In "[Xiang Pu]," one must use their palms for support and not necessarily grapple. In "[Shou Bo]," one must also look for opportunities to step and punch, aiming to strike the opponent's vital points, while "[Jiao Di]" involves grappling and hooking legs, with the main goal of throwing the opponent to the ground. The "History of the Five Dynasties" mentions that Li Cunxian was good at "[Jiao Di]." Records of strength competitions describe Mongolian beauty entering "[Xiang Pu]" circles, where contemporaries feared the lightness of their fists and hands. Also, Xie Jian of Yangzhou was over eight feet tall and immensely strong, rarely encountering an opponent. From then on, "[Jiao Di]" emphasized lightness, thus evolving into fist techniques and [Wrestling].</p>
<p>[Wrestling], formerly known as "[Shuai Jiao]," requires two participants to wear a "[Wrestling]" training garment, shaped like a short vest made of dense, coarse cloth, exposing the chest, with a belt tied in the arena, which is covered with sand. The participants pull and wrestle, with power generated from the legs and transmitted through the shoulders. Injuries are not penalized when wearing the garment in the arena. During the Ming Dynasty, "[Wrestling]" prohibited punches and kicks, focusing solely on wrestling until one falls. Chen Yuanyun traveled to Japan and taught the Japanese "[Jujutsu]." Therefore, Japanese "[Jujutsu]" also originated from our country's [Wrestling], except that "[Jujutsu]" includes lying on the ground and using legs to hook and sweep, which is slightly different from "[Wrestling]."</p>
<p>The Tong Jian (Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government) states that Liu Wu of the Tang Dynasty watched a "[Jiao Di]" performance with guests, shaking his shoulders and waving his arms to encourage the participants. Shaking shoulders and waving arms are characteristic of pulling and holding, which is the form of [Wrestling]. The Zhi Yan (Collected Sayings) quotes Zhou Qian's "Jiao Di Fu" (Ode to Jiao Di), saying "Charging forward and resisting backward, all are people of great strength; grabbing right and snatching left, all are using fist techniques," which all describe the state of [Guan Jiao] and cannot be compared to [Shou Bo] or [San Da]. There is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>Mongolian [Guan Jiao] Method: Every year in April, Mongolians worship the stars, and strong youths participate in [Guan Jiao] to determine the winner. The Living Buddha tests the participants for five days starting on June 15th every summer. At that time, the strongmen are selected by various lamas and sent to Kulun. The [Tu She] Living Buddha sits in the center, with lamas sitting beside him. First, a circular arc is drawn on the ground. Participants in [Guan Jiao] who step out of the circle are not selected, even if they are brave. Strongmen are not allowed to strip naked, wearing leather clothing and long leather boots. The [Guan Jiao] posture involves repeated kicking to destabilize the opponent and bring them to the ground. Touching the opponent's leg with one's own is not considered a loss, but touching the ground with the palm counts as a round. This is the general outline of Mongolian [Guan Jiao]. Manchuria and Tibet also value it, calling it "[Buku]." The Central National Arts Institute has adopted similar rules for [Wrestling]. Item 4 of the [Wrestling] regulations, "[Point Deduction]," states: (1) A full point is deducted if the opponent is thrown to the ground with their entire body. (2) A half point is deducted if the opponent is thrown to the ground without their entire body touching the ground.</p>

<p>The aggressive offense taught by Coach Oard (Piggy) Lamby of Purdue requires precise and timely movements, making it more important than hindering the enemy. Using this tactic, Kelley, Eddy, Wooden, and other four major players of the team achieved great success last winter. The number two player starts by passing the ball high to the number five player, who is running towards the free-throw line. The number four player cuts across the court in front of the number five player. The number three player also pretends to run towards the arc of the free-throw area but immediately reverses direction and rushes towards the basket after a few steps. After passing the ball, the number two player immediately follows and runs straight to receive the ball passed back by the number five player. This method can also be slightly modified as follows: the number five player does not need to pass the ball back to the number two player but can pass it to the number three or four player.

<h3 id="e171">Rapidly Changing Financial and Gold Markets <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>(Although the Storm is Big, the Decline is Only Two or Three Taels) 〓Ten Taels Difference in Half a Day〓</p>
<p>Yesterday's market weakened after being strong, changing rapidly. The waves were not small, with frequent fluctuations of three or four taels. There was almost a ten-tael difference between the morning and noon. In the end, compared to yesterday, it fell back by two or three taels, a small correction after a sharp rise. Dealers were hesitant, so buying and selling followed different paths. Overall, selling exceeded buying. The silver market went in a different direction, with the pound rising and the dollar falling. The forward market for silver also suddenly fell by half a point. Furthermore, exchange rates plummeted by more than three points, so the gold price initially rose and then fell. Sellers prevailed, and foreign exchange saw the pound and the dollar steady, while the gold market deteriorated. However, the state was complex and chaotic, fluctuating around 790 taels. At noon, the exchange rate loosened further, and the market was flooded with sellers. The atmosphere was not good, and the price was unsustainable, eventually falling back to the 790 tael mark. There was some swap trading, with bears like Ruikang and Dadecheng swapping into Tongfeng Heng, Qian Changxiang, and Yingfeng Heng for over 200 contracts, all offering 7 qian 4. Hengxing swapped over 210 contracts into Yingfeng Heng on the long side, paying one tael, causing the red bar to continue to fall, adding only 10 taels 75 to 10 taels 05. Later, due to the Wednesday market closure.</p>
<p>〓The High Opening Caused Selling Pressure〓 In the morning, the January contract opened up 5 taels 7 qian, at 797 taels 2 qian. Although the big bar rose by 1/16, the silver price fell, with a private telegram showing a drop of 16/7 points. The market opened high, with Bingxing Yifeng and Yong first advancing and continuing to rise to 97 taels 8 qian. Suddenly, selling became active, with companies like Jiheng, Yu Maoyong, Fuyu, Heng Changyong, and Dadecheng dumping. It then depreciated by over 5 taels to 92 taels 2 qian, probably because silver companies sold US dollars at 125. Then HSBC offered 125, and soon retail buyers advanced slightly, adding 1 tael 3 qian. However, Fuyu, Zhifengyong, Qian Changxiang, Tianfengyong, Hong Kangyong, and others became more eager to sell. Mitsui also offered US dollars at 1875 in December, breaking through 90 taels at 10:15, only entering at 89 taels. Later, Yuantai, Tong Taichang, Hengxing, and Futaiheng came in, so it rose again by over 3 taels. When HSBC announced that the gold pound was rising by 125 and the US dollar remained unchanged, it was at 92 taels. Then it was 2 taels 7 qian.</p>
<p>December first order 3.135 sold US dollars 125 until around ten o'clock, then fell back to 1 tael 6 qian. Hengxing came on the scene again and bought 400-500 contracts (said to be on behalf of the central government), and Yifeng also advanced over 200 contracts. Huabi, Mitsui, and Ande traded back and forth, and the March pound/dollar exchange rate totaled US$3.183125. HSBC absorbed February US dollars 375, so the gold price soared, 3 taels at 10:50 to 94 taels half. Hengyu, Yu Maoyong, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, etc. sold, falling again by over 2 taels. At 11 o'clock it was 91 taels 8 qian. Heng Changyong and Ruixing took in wheat. The Bank absorbed US dollars 1875 in December. In just three minutes, it raised 1 tael and 2 qian to 93 taels. Then the Wheat Bank sold US dollars 375 in February and because Hengyu, Fuyu, Yifengyong, Hongkangyong, Yu Maoyong, Dadecheng, Yuanchun and other fixed-price sets were sold together, the price plummeted by more than 4 taels. In just 20 minutes, there was a rise and fall of one tael until 11:20, it was 88 taels half. Yifeng came in for the second time and raised it to 90 taels 06 qian. After 11:30, Huabi released US dollars 375 in January, and Yu Xingyong Gan Changxiang, Tong Taichang, Yifengyong were eager to sell, and Hengxing sold more than 300 contracts again, causing the price to fall again by more than 2 taels. Nearly closed at 88 taels. A moment ago, Fuyu, Hengchangyong, Wanxing and items were dragged in, raising 1 tael and a half to 89 taels 5 qian. When noon closed at 89 taels 2 qian, it fell back by 2 taels 3 qian compared with the previous day. However, Tongtaichang and Hengyu sold again, so it continued to fall to 8 taels 56 qian. Hengxing then bought and sold back and forth at 9 taels. According to the biggest half-day 97 taels 8 qian, the smallest was 88 taels, with a difference of 9 taels 8 qian.</p>
<p>The key was from 73 taels to 70 taels, and the result of 77 taels was 76 taels, which was 3 taels more than the previous day. The book was settled in December at 90 taels, January at 89 taels, and water was made up at 90 taels. 〓Trading in the industry was more selling than buying〓 Transactions on the table were quite different, but deposits and withdrawals were very active. According to statistics, Bingxing, Wanxing, Futaiheng, Hengchangyong, Yuantai, and Ruixing all progressed smoothly. Yiyu, Yu Xingyong, Qian Changxiang, Yifengyong, Yu Maoyong, Hong Kangyong, and Yuan Kangxiang all sold, with more sellers than buyers. Hengyu, Fuyu, and Dadecheng sold even more. Tong Taichang advanced and retreated, totaling about 800 or 900 contracts. The Dalian gang advanced more than 400 contracts and sold more than 200 contracts. The Guangdong gang Hengxing advanced 800 or 900 contracts and sold 400 or 500 contracts. Yifeng advanced 400 or 500 contracts, it is said.</p>

<p>The domestic market trend is inconsistent. Yesterday's silver market saw the pound rise and the US dollar. Private telegrams fell 4375, but the market was confused and the exchange rate declined severely, resulting in the Shanghai market. The pound was strong and the US dollar was firm. HSBC listed the pound gold long at 125 and the US dollar did not change. Other countries such as India and India saw a deficit, while France and Germany were doing well. The Hong Kong exchange rate was as before. As for the domestic market, the trend was slightly different. It is estimated that pound gold initially loosened, then stabilized, and finally the long of the previous day was 125. Transactions were only several tens of thousands of pounds. Gold dealers sold and banks made some deals, while HSBC bought positions. US dollars were initially firm, then widened, and then slightly fluctuated. At noon, it was still loose. The overall assessment was slightly longer at zero six two five. Although the gold price was not small, the result was that the sharp fall was only more than two taels. Therefore, there was more supply and less demand in the gold industry, so the arbitrage price was slightly opened, and the quoted price was more than 70 taels. Silver companies came out recently, and Ander and Huabi Sanyi exchanged US dollar exchange rates in March, calculated as US$28 yuan 4375, first order 19.4375, set US$3 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen 3125. Due to no market on Wednesday afternoon, today's half-day trading is listed below. (British Exchange) The domestic market rose or fell only zero six two five in half a day. The early market selling price was one shilling nine, three one two five. The forward four three seven five buying price was plus zero six two five. Mitsui HSBC made three one two five in December.

<p>丨At the end of the month, the collection and settlement of silver dollars is huge丨 Yesterday, at the end of the month, the collection and settlement of silver dollars was very, very huge, and the summary time was therefore extended. It was difficult to estimate the amount of foreign silver collected and settled. The foreign penny market was 7 qian 1 fen 1 li 3 hao 7 in the early market, suddenly half of the previous day's noon market went down by 1 li 1 hao 2 suddenly. The afternoon market rebounded 125 to 7 qian 1 fen 1 li, half of the early and noon markets of silver demolition were still 3 fen, the flat head plus water two or three fen to make out the exchange draft. The early market was 1.39 million, the noon market was 1.03 million, the early market for banknotes was 50,000, and the noon market was 15,000. The early market for off-site banknotes was 115,000, the noon market was 55,000, the early market for supporting notes was 45,000, and the early market was 30,000. Bank buying and selling was 1.25 million in the early market and 800,000 in the noon market. Each bank's foreign account had a turnover of approximately 2 million, and the number of demolition transactions was more than 7 million. The number of customers going to the stomach was 500,000, and the number of small pawnshop transactions was more than 800,000. Yesterday, the large amount of foreign money transactions was purely due to the sales of large amounts of money required for securities delivery, and the large amount of foreign silver collected and settled was entirely the monthly summary, which was not very important. The market situation of coins in Jiangnan small silver was the same in the early and noon markets at 6 qian 1 fen 9 li. The transaction volume in the early market was 4,000 jiao, and in the noon market it was 2,500 jiao. The small silver in Guangdong was 6 qian 1 fen 6 and a half in the early market, which was half a li less than the previous noon change. The transaction volume in the early market was 65,000 jiao, and the transaction volume in the noon market was 45,000 jiao. The copper yuan was changed and increased by 2,000 wen to 396,000. The transaction volume was 37,620 strings, and the silver was 9,500 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Total Number of Silver Demolitions for the Entire Month <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>丨Only One Two Qian Two Fen丨 The silver demolition in the previous month was stable due to the lack of silver funds. In the end, it never reached one qian during the entire day, and there were no reports of white borrowing in the market. Every day it stood at a few points, so the total amount of the entire month's statistics was only one liang two qian two fen. Calculated in 30 days, each day only amounted to four fen zero six six six seven, which was a far cry from the fixed dish of two liang stipulated. Probably there will be a decision on this deposit and interest tomorrow, always deducting it from the fixed dish of two liang ninety-five.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Bond Prices Rise Sharply <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>▲Other bonds up by more than one yuan, market extremely active▲</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 30th), trading of spot goods was scarce on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market. Only "Compilation Reduction," "20," and "Finance" three types opened, and there were no transactions for others. Futures trading was extremely active, with prices rising even more sharply. Regarding the trend of various bond prices, the market was very active in buying at the opening in the morning. Demand far exceeded supply, and prices uniformly rose sharply, continuing the trend from the beginning of the week. The strength of the rise was quite astonishing, almost unprecedented in recent years. Even the extremely weak and sparsely traded "96 Public Bond" suddenly saw someone buying, and in the late market, it soared to over 7 yuan, jumping up by several jiao (tenths of a yuan), already resembling the price at the beginning of the year. As a result, both the near-term and far-term contracts were higher than before the settlement date. For example, the whole "6" far-term and "20" customs spot goods both rose by two yuan and three jiao. The "20" roll finance December futures each rose by one yuan and eighty-nine jiao. Other bonds each rose by one yuan to one yuan and forty-five jiao. It is said that the steady and sharp rise in bond prices is partly due to the prevailing environment, and the increasing amount of silver dollars in the financial sector, due to the narrowing ratio between silver dollars and gold, is gradually being used for investment, boosting buyer sentiment. The spot goods totaled only 4,000 yuan, while the futures market reached 5.55 million yuan, totaling 14.84 million yuan.</p>

The exchange rate for the British pound and silver futures both plummeted to new lows, but the stock market did not show any significant fluctuations. Gold mining stocks were quite strong. U.S. Steel was unstable due to rumors that the upcoming board meeting would take up preferred stock dividends. Overall, the total daily trading volume was 500,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing prices compared to the previous day: 30 industrial stocks 58.77, down 0.40; 20 railroad stocks 26.27, down 0.14; 20 utility stocks 26.70, down 0.06; 40 bonds 77.33, down 0.15.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Extremely Pessimistic Yarn Market <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is extremely sluggish due to excessively weak actual demand and a deteriorating environment. As a result, the stock of goods at various factories is gradually increasing. With the end of the year approaching rapidly, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ease the credit situation. Therefore, the market atmosphere is very pessimistic. Fortunately, the underlying base is small and can still provide temporary support. It is said that there are more than 30,000 bales of yarn in the port of Hankou and also inventory in Tianjin, so the yarn market is particularly unstable under these circumstances.</p>
<p>(Benchmark down one or two taels) The market opened firmer due to rising American cotton prices, and sentiment was slightly better. The prices for each month remained unchanged for the first two or three rounds of trading, then weakened, with prices for each month falling by one, two, or three qian (hundredths of a tael). In the afternoon, news of weak actual demand caused the market to loosen again, and some manufacturers sold short, further weakening the market, with prices for each month falling by two, three, four, five, or six qian. The total daily transaction volume was 30,600 dan (a unit of weight). Longfeng sold 2,600 bales, Dafu 1,050 bales, Dafeng 800 bales, Rongxing 800 bales, and Tongxing 1,250 bales. Yicheng bought 1,700 bales, Zanfeng 800 bales, and Yukang 800 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>(Actual Demand Very Sluggish) The movement of spot yarn is extremely quiet. According to the daily statistics of purchases by various groups, only 413 bales were bought. The market price fell by 2.5 qian. The Shenxin factory opened with 3,000 bales of 20-count Caihua yarn at a price of 118 taels for delivery in the first, second, and third months, which were all sold out.

<h3 id="e180">Cotton Market Situation Still Favorable <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning and afternoon, but the overall situation was still favorable. Due to rising American cotton prices and high gold prices, sentiment was still good, and there were still many buyers. However, with the yarn market declining daily, factories are unwilling to purchase raw materials. Furthermore, the price of Indian cotton is gradually approaching. It is said that there are approximately 80,000 to 90,000 bales of cotton in Hankou's inventory, and the supply from various producing areas has slightly loosened. Therefore, some bulls have released their positions to close out their profits. The overall situation of the cotton market is also relatively flat. (Zheng Benchmark Slightly Lively) The market opened firmer due to rising American cotton prices, and sentiment was slightly tighter. The prices for each month rose by one qian. The second and third rounds of trading weakened, and as a result, the prices for each month rose by one qian. In the afternoon, the prices for each month fell by five fen (hundredths of a qian). The total daily transaction volume was 52,000 dan. Tongfu sold 2,800 dan, Taixing 1,900 dan, Yichang 2,400 dan, Yuchang 2,400 dan, and Rongxing 1,500 dan. Jifeng bought 7,300 dan, Deji 2,900 dan, Senkang 2,400 dan, and Yuanda 1,900 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

British cotton futures rose by 3 or 4 points, spot goods fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 9 points.

<p>(Shanghai South) The sources of various groups are five or more than ten. Due to the end of the year for Guoli (National Calendar), the firms on both sides are preparing to end and collect accounts, so the transaction is quiet. The Su Tong group called for a rise of a few jiao. Early and late rice arrival and sales are even. The market is not rising or falling. Foreign Du sharp top rice is somewhat weaker (Xin Zha) Ships from the Yejidun area have not arrived, and the number is not much, about fifteen or sixteen. The sales market in this street is slightly thick. No honor or disgrace. Thin rice and early rice are sold as they arrive, and the shape is hard five fen. The price of rice from the river is 3,000 shi (a unit of volume).</p>
<h3 id="e185">Ke Xian Rice Arrival and Sales are Both Strong <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>丨The Fujian group has a strong appetite丨 Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice situation was active, and the market atmosphere was good. Because there were not many arrivals in recent days, after arriving, they were sold as they arrived, and there was no accumulation in the market. The production price was fair, and the handling was also quite appropriate. The Fujian province groups have very strong appetites, and they especially need Hunan Ke Xian rice, so the market price is firm, which is very different from the sluggishness of foreign rice. Yesterday, more than 600 bags of Hunan machine oil rice were opened at a price of 8 yuan and 8 or 9 jiao, and 110 bags of rice were opened at a price of 7 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. Also, 200 bags of machine red rice were opened at a price of 8 yuan, and 200 bags of rough red rice were opened at a price of 6 yuan and 8 jiao and a half. Wuhu Yuan rice, 73 bags, was opened at a price of 10 yuan. Except for a small number of purchases by the Beiyang group, they were all purchased by the Fujian group.</p>

<p>▲Old Car Brand 2,000 Bags▲</p>
<p>Yesterday, the end of the month delivery futures market lacked volume and the spot market was also sluggish. The monthly futures delivery has also been completed. According to statistics, only Fufeng Factory delivered 2,000 bags of red and blue car flour, which were received by No. 3. There were no other deliveries. These 2,000 bags from Fufeng were also due to a mistake in crushing, and the total number had to be delivered. This is because the factories do not have much stock, and the cost is too high, so they do not bother to deliver spot goods.</p>
<h3 id="e187">A Total of Seven Carloads Were Delivered <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Last month, only seven carloads were delivered to the exchange, which were delivered by Yuanyu and others, and received by Huafeng Factory. There were few spot wheat arrivals and stocks in the market, so there were very few chips. Even the number of direct deliveries was not many. Approximately 30 carloads were delivered in advance before the middle of the month.</p>

<p>Sin Fung Trading Company reports that on Tuesday (the 29th), Chicago wheat fell initially due to long liquidation but rebounded due to poor winter production reports. As a result, prices were mixed. On the 28th, the total trading volume was 30 million bushels. The market prices for the 29th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing prices compared to the previous day: December futures 41.875, down 0.20; May futures 46.750, down 0.125; July futures 47.500, down 1.250.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market presented a sluggish appearance. Although overseas silk prices have risen, the exchange rate is still rigid, rising in name but weakening in reality. Chinese silk merchants believe that it is difficult to sell at a loss, and the market atmosphere is quiet. Yesterday, only Xinfu entered the Linwei brand's top No. 2, Qilibai, dried silk, 30 packages, at a price of 520 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign tea market, British merchants such as Shangjinlong and Xiehe received telegrams from Morocco requesting Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, etc., and began to handle it. The entire city talked about 600 boxes, and the market price did not fluctuate. Needle eyebrow pearl tea and other items also had some scattered transactions, and the prices were firm. However, the Russian Assistance Association's recognition price for the Gongxi item has been particularly harsh recently, and the market price of goods from Wuyuan Northwest and other regions has fallen to 27 or 28 taels, the lowest level since the outbreak of the European War. Chinese tea merchants have suffered huge losses.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the metal market situation remained the same as the previous day. Although the Jiangxi group suddenly rose in customer sales, the Sichuan group stopped operating due to the low water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The appetite of other groups, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou, was similar to before. The factories' business did not improve significantly yesterday. According to investigations, the total daily transactions of various goods reached more than 4,000. Among the colors, small finish nails have been soaring in price due to the extremely small amount of goods in the market. Three-fen nails are estimated at 14 taels, four-fen nails at 13 taels, five-fen nails at 12 taels and 5 qian, and six-fen nails at 13 taels, which is 5 qian to 1 tael higher than before. However, the underlying inventory is extremely depleted, resulting in buyers having no goods to buy. According to news from industry sources, this batch of goods will arrive next month, so there is no need to worry about shortages in the market. Other goods, such as plain white iron, corrugated iron, British copper plates, angle iron, new lead wire, and shear iron, were all traded in the market yesterday, but there was no change in market prices.</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Pearl of Toledo <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— By P. Merimee, translated by Bingzhi</p>
<p>Who can tell me which is more beautiful, the sun when it rises or when it sets? Who can tell me which is the most beautiful tree, the olive or the almond? Who can tell me which are the bravest people, the Valencians or the Andalusians? Who can tell me which is the most beautiful woman's face? I tell you who is the most beautiful woman: it is Arode Vargas, the Pearl of Toledo.</p>
<p>The black man Duzani ordered his spear to be brought, his shield to be brought; his spear he held in his right hand, his shield hung around his neck. He went down to his stable, where he gazed upon his forty-four mares one by one. He said, "Bercha is the strongest; I will bring back the Pearl of Toledo on her broad back, or else I will never return to Cordoba." He set out, riding his horse, and reached Toledo, where he met an old man near Zaggadan. "Good old man, please deliver this letter to Mr. Judea, Mr. Judea de Sarzana. If he is a man, he will come to the Alma Maimon spring to fight me. The Pearl of Toledo shall belong to one of us." The old man took the letter and gave it to Count de Sarzana, who was playing chess with the Pearl of Toledo. The Count read the letter, the letter of challenge, and slammed his hand on the table, knocking everything off. He immediately stood up and ordered his spear to be brought, his good horse to be brought; and the Pearl of Toledo also stood up, trembling all over, for she knew he was going to duel. "Lord Judea, Mr. Judea de Sarzana, please stay, I beg you, please stay here and play chess with me." "I will play no more chess, I am going to play with spears near the Alma Maimon spring." Arode's tears could not stop him, for nothing can stop a knight from dueling. So the Pearl of Toledo put on her cloak, mounted her mule, and went to the Alma Maimon spring. The grass around the spring was red. The water was also red. But what dyed the grass red, dyed the spring red, was not the blood of a Christian. The black man Duzani lay sleeping, facing the sky; Mr. Judea's spear was broken in his chest; the remaining blood was gradually disappearing. His mare Bercha looked at him with tears, for she could not heal her master's spear wound. The Pearl of Toledo dismounted from her mule. "Knight, be brave! You will live, and you can marry a beautiful Moless girl in the future; my hands know how to heal the spear wounds left by my warriors." "Ah, such a pure pearl, such a beautiful pearl, please pull out the shard of the spear that cut open my chest! This cold spear makes me freeze and shiver." She approached without suspicion; but he mustered his strength and slashed that beautiful face with the blade of his waist knife.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Address Before the Curtain <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>[Free Talk] can be regarded as a free [stage]. On this [stage], we can freely [perform], that is, freely [talk]. Until yesterday, the [performance] on this stage came to an end and the curtain closed. From today onwards, new activities begin and the curtain will open again. We won't talk too much about what's inside, just watch. However, before the audience is eager to know what's behind the curtain, we [people on stage] must briefly state our attitude.</p>
<p>We believe that everything in the world is progressing and becoming modern. Firstly, it should be theoretically and secondly, it is practically necessary. We believe that our life's cultivation greatly depends on literature and art, and it is a natural fact that literature and art should progress and modernize, and need to progress and modernize. Although we cannot report everything in advance about what we [perform on this stage] in the future in terms of programs, we must firmly establish our foothold for progress and modernity, even if it is some clowning or some posturing, we dare not deal with it casually.</p>
<p>But we have to bring the conversation back a little. Although we are not willing to perform monkey shows, imitating human behavior, to win the audience's smile, we are not willing to sing a few "eighteen touches, lovesickness in the fifth watch," or hum a few lines of "[clouds are light, wind is gentle, near noon]," to cater to the general shallow tastes, but we never want to sing a high tune, raise any banners, blow any horns, or send out any dignified [seemingly serious] mighty army, to promote any doctrine, and force the tastes of individuals or a small group of people on the majority. We only believe that the elements of life, literature and art, should and need to progress and modernize; at the same time, we don't want to be too far from the audience, [playing gongs and drums and singing operas ourselves], only [cheering in the background]. The curtain is opening, the free [stage] is appearing, and the people on stage are freely [performing], just watch. 乂乂乂乂</p>
<h3 id="e208">[The Weather is Fine Today!] <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Shengtao</p>
<p>[Free Talk], this is a phantom-like noun. In the time of Qin Shihuang, if two people met on the road, stopped and talked a sentence or two, they would commit a capital crime, and what they talked about was not asked. Later, although there were no such straightforward and simple laws, on the one hand, there were model-making creeds, teaching people how to talk; on the other hand, there were so many laws, prohibiting people from talking about what they were not allowed to talk about. Under this dual pressure, is there still [Free Talk]?</p>
<p>Some of the discussions we hear and some of the texts we see are all surviving in the narrow gaps of this dual pressure. Only by not touching this side or offending that side can they be said and written, and we can hear and see them. If this limit is exceeded, the discussions can only be swallowed into the stomach and let them rot; as for the texts, they are split into editions, destroyed, and prohibited from delivery. Their disasters are more than one. So we have no chance to hear and see them.</p>
<p>The environment is like this, and people become unusually alert and smooth. How to be able to turn freely in the narrow gaps of dual pressure has become a compulsory course for people who establish words and hold opinions. If one studies this subject too well, one may even have an illusion, shrinking the narrow gap in which one is located even narrower. Let me give an example. Recently, many scholars in Beiping advocated designating Beiping as a cultural city, withdrawing military equipment, and avoiding the ravages of Japanese airplanes and cannons; but in their written opinions, they only vaguely referred to [the enemy], and the word [Japan] was never seen. They probably thought this way: if they explained it clearly in this written opinion of [planning ahead], saying it was for Japan's sake, it would be too embarrassing for Japan.</p>
<p>Wanting to talk about Mr. Zhang, fearing that Mr. Zhang would be suspicious, not talking. Wanting to talk about Mr. Li, fearing that Mr. Li would be angry, not talking. Let's talk about A and B, but fearing that Mr. Zhao and Mr. Wang, who are related to A and B, would be unhappy, so it's better not to talk. So talk about the weather. But saying the weather is bad may offend this silent and speechless nature, and suddenly a gust of strong wind and rain will come, hurting the head and wetting the clothes; this is still not acceptable. [Pushing a cart against a wall], only saying the weather is good is the only appropriate way. So, when two people meet, they often say in unison, [The weather is fine today!]</p>
<h3 id="e209">Written After the Feast, Amidst the Scattered Dishes <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>丨Recording a certain banquet丨</p>
<p>A group of [heroes] who wield pens gathered at a restaurant in a corner of Fourth Avenue. The [heroes] totaled twenty-four 丨丨twenty men and four women. Among them were two pairs of [wives-to-be], one pair being Mr. Li Dachao and Mrs. Wang Xiaoying, and the other pair being the [highly respected] veteran Mr. Chen Wangdao and his editor-in-chief Weiyin's wife, Ms. Cai Cai.</p>
<p>It's hard to say they were all [heroes], but perhaps because they had never fought before, they were not very familiar with each other. So, in a group of [occasional whispers], someone hurried to call Bingxin, who was [enlisting in the army], as Ding Ling, who was [in the dark], and someone hurried to call Ms. Cai, who was editing Weiyin, as Lu Yin, and some people were quietly asking [which one is humorous] Lin Yutang? Which one is the stunning Zhang Ziping?</p>
<p>After a flurry of activity, the heroes each occupied a seat. Then, slowly, the floor was littered with melon seed shells, the air was filled with cigarette rings, and a faint smile hung on the face of each [hero], waiting for another [hero]'s question, looking for a suitable topic of conversation. Amidst a group of scattered voices, every happy heart was active.</p>
<p>After taking their seats, the heroes were divided into three piles in a line. During the banquet, Miss Bingxin eagerly asked about Mr. Zhang Ziping's newly built house, new creations, and when he would invite everyone to dinner, while Mr. Zhang's reply was a small thatched cottage, old age, ... and so on. Then someone added the title of [writing capitalist] to Mr. Zhang, and suggested that everyone move into his new house to live.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang did not stay until the end of the banquet, nodded, said hello, and left alone humorously; while Mr. Xie Liuyi, who loved to write essays, often buried his head in eating vegetables, blew cigarette rings into the sky, and did not talk much. After three rounds of wine and three courses of dishes, the host stood up to speak, humbly and elegantly reporting that this meal was not easy to eat, and there was more to come..., everyone was refreshed and relieved.</p>
<p>Then followed the self-introductions of each person by name, starting with Mr. Li Dachao: [I, Li Dachao, from Guangdong!] Mr. Hu Yuzhi's self-introduction was: [I, Hu Yuzhi, do some irrelevant things in the Oriental Magazine.] [That's an irrelevant thing], a burst of laughter. Mr. Cao Zhongyuan, who played wireless radio tricks, said mischievously and humorously, [I am Cao Cao's Cao, styled Zhongyuan, the second son, and the brother of Cao Mengde.] Then there was another burst of laughter. But fortunately, fortunately, no one was surnamed [Wang] that day.... The last one was Miss Gao, after the [I] word, the voice was so low that it could not be heard. Someone shouted softly: [One more], but it was finally brushed over.</p>
<p>After the introductions, the air was still filled with laughter, talking, and cigarette rings, drinking and eating vegetables. Everyone cheered up again and mobilized fully, and our host, Mr. Li Liewen, was even more like a newly married bride, with a solemn and flushed face, like [Luo Tong killing the four gates], sharing a cup of soup in every pile of busy hands. After the dishes were finished and the dishes were scattered, everyone put down a busy hand, with satisfied smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>After another nod and handshake, the heroes left, and under the lights of the quiet night, everyone went their separate ways home. 乂乂乂乂</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>It was more than a month after Lin Haiquan had been living in Professor Zeng Bingyuan's house that he learned that the Japanese wife, who took care of him like a sister and was very happy about his daily life, was his father's friend and also the third wife of Professor Zeng. This was told to him by a classmate named Tang Yaoxing this morning. [So that's how it is. No wonder she is so young. So she is someone's concubine.] Lin Haiquan sat in the rickshaw, feeling that he had undergone a great change in spirit today. As for what kind of change, he himself was inexplicable and could not express it concretely. He only felt that after Tang Yaoxing told him this secret, he felt a sense of disappointment and at the same time discovered a miracle.</p>
<p>[How old is she this year? Not thirty, right? ...I'm afraid she's over thirty. However, she is good at makeup, dressing up like a fashionable female student, but when facing her directly, one can discover the middle-aged features on her face, although very small, but undeniable. ...] Professor Zeng is an expert in economics. After returning from Waseda University in Japan, he lived in the European continent 丨丨Germany and France丨丨 for more than two years before returning to Shanghai in the winter of the year before last. Since he published two or three major works and translations, he has become a celebrity in the publishing world. He is now the head of the economics department of 乂乂 University, a consultant to a certain institution, and a consultant to a certain bank. In the eyes of the party-state dignitaries, he is certainly not worth anything, but in the special zoo 丨丨China's institutions of higher learning丨丨, in the eyes of young people like Lin Haiquan, he is indeed a figure to be envied.</p>
<p>When Haiquan first came to Shanghai from the south, he first visited his father's friend, Zeng Bingyuan. Because Professor Zeng used to teach at a middle school in the south, and he worked with Haiquan's father 丨Haiquan's father was the principal, and he was an English teacher丨.</p>
<p>Before seeing Professor Zeng, Haiquan thought that he must be as old as his father. But after meeting him, it was completely contrary to his imagination. Professor Zeng was still a middle-aged man under forty, and his attitude was as warm and amiable as his appearance, giving Haiquan a very good impression. However, his complexion was a little pale, and there was also a set of black and purple circles around his eyes. This was probably a sign of his hard work and excessive worldly desires.</p>
<p>When Haiquan first arrived in Shanghai, he was unfamiliar with the place, and regarding the issue of residence, he also followed his father's orders and brought it up to ask this father's friend. [Living in a dormitory is also possible. However, ... if you are willing, live here. The houses on the third floor and the garret are empty.] [The garret is a bit cold. The overhanging building is better.]</p>
<p>At that time, Mrs. Zeng, who was just sitting silently on the side listening to her husband and this newly arrived young man talking, suddenly interjected. After she said that, she smiled and looked at Haiquan, and then chirped a string of Japanese to her husband. Haiquan had long known that Professor Zeng's wife was a Japanese woman. But he really did not expect that this Japanese wife's Chinese was so clear.</p>
<p>Before he even passed the university entrance exam, he moved into Professor Zeng's house. [If there is anything inconvenient, just tell me directly. The old nanny in this house is both lazy and disobedient. I'm afraid she won't listen to you. If you have anything, tell me.] When he first moved in, while still tidying up his luggage in the room, Mrs. Zeng 丨丨by Professor Zeng's introduction, her name is Hezi丨丨 walked in with a smile and helped him fold the bedding on the small iron bed. [I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Aunt Zeng, I'm really sorry.]</p>
<p>Seeing Mrs. Hezi so diligently cleaning his bedding, Haiquan just blushed and said sorry to her repeatedly. [It's okay, Mr. Lin. Do you find it strange? But in Japan, this is very common. Women who have been sunbathed will not be young mistresses, only maids. 丨丨Cheap bones.]</p>

<p>— Xie Liuyi</p>
<p>Mr. Bo had a baby boy last month. To comfort his wife and celebrate the new budding life, he invited several relatives and friends to hold a simple wedding noodles feast. I wrapped a gift in red paper and wrote a few words on it: [Wishing the future warrior a long life.] This sentence has six more words than the customary [Long life and wealth], although it is a bit fruity, it is the only way to express my feelings. Raising children in this era is really not easy. Not to mention the parents' responsibilities, the children themselves also bear a heavy burden. From the moment they separate from the womb, they are thrown into various environments; and the debts owed by their ancestors must be repaid by this generation. If they don't become warriors, how can they bear the responsibilities of future Chinese people? The French writer Romain Rolland said: [The real warrior dares to face the bleak life.] The children raised now must be asked to be warriors or soldiers, because nothing is more bleak than the life of a weak nation under imperialist oppression. Mr. Bo himself is a warrior, founding a weekly magazine, almost acting as a one-man show. His child should also be a future warrior, so I congratulate his child. Doing things only gets more and more desolate; any silver or gold wedding anniversary celebrations are also more and more cheesy the more they are celebrated. Although the wedding noodles feast is also a traditional custom of patriarchal society, it does not lose its [joy of birth]. It always carries the meaning of celebrating a [new birth]. Holding a wedding noodles feast means that parents are responsible for the newborn child; cultivating their child in all aspects to become a warrior, fighting for themselves and fighting for society and the country. We hope that each generation is better than the last. So, newborn children are worth celebrating. Other than that, the wedding noodles feast has no meaning.</p>

<p>— Bingying</p>
<p>The Shen Bao has a history of sixty years in the Chinese journalistic world. It would be a great pity if such a long-standing newspaper, which has a deep relationship with the evolution of Chinese society, were to remain stagnant in an era full of contradictions and yet moving forward! In recent days, Mr. Li Liewen invited me to write something for the soon-to-be-reformed [Free Talk]. While I am blessing this newborn [Free Talk] to move forward, I also want to take this opportunity to say a few words casually. I feel that the cultural level of a country and the survival ability of a nation are closely related. Although the May Fourth Movement in China also nurtured some sprouts of new culture, it gradually declined due to the reflection of economic relations. In addition, the drastic devastation in the middle made the culture in the revolutionary process almost take the path of returning to antiquity. In recent years, there seems to have been a sudden change, but in reality, it still shows many different outlines. This is indeed a unique phenomenon in China and the reason why China's cultural movement cannot make long-term progress. This really gives young people a lot of impressions of wandering crossroads. I am unwilling to make excessive demands on this newborn [Free Talk] with purely subjective wishes, but I would like to contribute as much as possible on the themes of grasping the masses that produce China's new cultural life, and I hope that this newborn [Free Talk] can sympathize with it and maintain its balanced progress! Due to the same starting point, I hope that the future [Free Talk] can follow the highest tide of culture to promote the wheel of the times! At least I hope that the works I write myself can have such efforts and gains. Finally, I sincerely wish [Free Talk] to work hard for China's new culture!</p>

<h3 id="e214">The So-Called Imperial Army Warriors <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The Japanese laugh at us as [an unorganized country] and as [a country of bandits], and spread this slogan everywhere. Indeed, our warlords are not making progress. In this era, they still have to perform the drama of [internal strife], while bandits and communists take the opportunity to steal and launch attacks. Our country's weaknesses, although not as bad as the Japanese promote, do have places that cannot be glossed over. However, in this world political and economic trend that cannot be stabilized, any country inevitably has events of the same nature occurring, the only difference is the degree. Take Japan as an example. When cabinets rise and fall, the number of important figures assassinated is countless, and cases of communist theft are even more widespread. If we are to speak strictly, in an organized country, and not a country of bandits, the national conditions should naturally not be like this. Today, let me cite one thing to prove it.</p>
<p>[According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun yesterday, Nomura, the machine gun platoon leader of the Third Regiment of the Azabu Infantry who was dispatched to Shanghai, returned to Japan from Shanghai. In early May, due to being laid off, on the 18th of this month, he sneaked into the Makihara residence near the Sugamo Prison and robbed it. He was arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. Nomura had previously committed theft. This time he committed robbery again. However, the Metropolitan Police Department considered him an [Imperial Army Warrior] who had been dispatched to Shanghai and, after advising him, released him.]</p>
<p>This is a fact reported by the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun. It can be seen that the personality of the so-called [Imperial Army Warrior] of a civilized country is only like this. Under the principle that good people do not become soldiers, there is no need to demand or blame them further. However, in terms of national law, although our country is an unorganized country, when there was a soldier from a certain company who robbed in Kunshan during the Shanghai battle, our generals immediately dealt with him according to military law and never tolerated him. We will never allow him to violate the law and disrupt discipline because he has contributed to the Anti-Japanese War. Merits should not go unrewarded, and crimes should not go unpunished. This is the great law of the country, and the laws of all countries governed by the rule of law are like this.</p>
<p>Assuming that because they are [Imperial Army Warriors], they are allowed to do whatever they want and no questions are asked, it is directly rewarding warriors and indirectly rewarding bandits. From then on, everyone who has been on the battlefield has an amulet for exemption from crime, and everyone who has served in the military once has the qualification to be a bandit. In this way, theft cases will be endless. Although our country is an unorganized country, we can still recognize the concept of law, while the so-called civilized and organized countries even have special new laws to reward bandits.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Alcohol <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>Alcohol is a colorless, light, and volatile liquid. At zero degrees, its specific gravity is equal to 0.8062. It has a pleasant and fast fragrance. Its boiling point is 78 degrees Celsius. It only solidifies at minus 130 degrees Celsius, so it can be used to make thermometers. When burned, it shows a green flame. Its gas mixed with oxygen in the air will explode when burned. The properties of alcohol are roughly as described above. Below, I will talk about its manufacturing method to provide readers with a little common sense.</p>
<p>The manufacturing method of this alcohol is to add brewer's yeast to an extremely dilute sugar solution to ferment it (Fermentation) to produce carbonic acid wine. After 24 hours, take it out and distill it at low temperature to obtain alcohol containing a large amount of water. Then, add dry lime to absorb the water, filter it with cloth, and then distill it at low temperature to obtain relatively pure alcohol, but the limit of its purity is only 98%, and this manufacturing method is for small quantities. As for wanting to make a large quantity, soak barley in water, wait for it to germinate, and when the sprouts grow to three-quarters of the length of the barley, spread it flat for several days, and then dry it with low temperature, crush it with a pestle, then add five-grain flour and boil it, then the starch contained in it will become glucose, then filter it with cloth, let it cool, transfer it to a fermentation barrel, add brewer's yeast to ferment it (the longer the time, the more complete the fermentation). Take it out after an appropriate time, and it will be ordinary beverage wine, which contains about 10% to 50% alcohol, then distill it by distillation. The alcohol obtained before 78 degrees Celsius is alcohol, and the water obtained after 78 degrees Celsius is water, but in actual distillation, a small amount of water is distilled before 78 degrees Celsius, so the alcohol obtained is only 90% to 92%. If you want to refine it further, add quicklime powder to the alcohol to absorb most of the water, filter it, and re-distill it to obtain 98% alcohol, which is the best quality alcohol. The value of this kind of extremely pure alcohol is three or four times that of crude alcohol because the manufacturing loss is too much. To make ordinary cologne, you can use 90% to 92% alcohol, but you must first use bone charcoal to remove its odor to avoid hindrance. If you want to make high-quality cologne, you must use more pure alcohol, so the values of these two are also different. To know whether alcohol contains water or not, you can use the following inspection methods:</p>
<p>(1) Add colorless powder of anhydrous copper sulfate to alcohol. If it turns blue, it is evidence of containing water.</p>
<p>(2) Add kerosene to alcohol. If it contains a large amount of water, it will become cloudy.</p>
<p>(3) Use an alcohol meter to check its specific gravity to know how much water the alcohol contains.</p>

<p>Old Man Tui received a letter from his hometown friend Liu, knowing that the bandits were raising troops outside the city of Hezhou every day. He was deeply anxious and angrily recited this to express his worries. In the countryside of the old home, wild smoke rises. The bandit situation and military reports are both vast and unclear. The lonely city is as big as a dipper, the wind and clouds are evil. The heroes are ambitious, and the fortifications are firm. There is no good place to avoid danger like piled eggs. The aid troops are hopeless, and they cry to the sky in chaos. It takes effort to plan to resolve disputes and difficulties. Who is the outstanding figure like Zhong Lian? The thorny land and thorny sky are too bitter to support. Heroic hot tears are chaotic like silk. Bad clouds press against the battlements, and people are crying. Abusive snow raises dust, and the emperor does not know. Hawks and falcons fly far away, indulging in proud pheasants and rabbits. Jackals and wolves are in power, indulging foxes and raccoons. Scholars emptyly embrace the peace and security strategy. When will they get the axe and handle?</p>

<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>For parents, it is a very honorable thing to wait for their children to marry, but the date of the wedding cannot be sloppy. Beforehand, they have to ask a blind fortune teller to calculate the eight characters of the birth date. Otherwise, if unfortunate events happen after the young couple gets married, the parents will feel somewhat sorry for the younger generation. Therefore, for the son's wedding and the daughter's departure, they must ask a blind fortune teller to find a good day. Originally, just in Shanghai, if there were no one coming to calculate the eight characters and look at the good days in the fortune-telling shops that are every three steps or five steps, how would they maintain their lives? However, the skills of these blind fortune tellers are really too great. The dates they see for weddings often cause the happy events of many families to be on the same day. The Zhang family is getting married today, and the Li family is also getting married today, even hundreds or thousands of families are getting married on the same day. I don't understand whether the fates of these many new couples are the same. If they get married on this day, will everyone be infinitely happy in the future!</p>
<p>In fact, to be frank, the blind fortune teller decides on a day, you only need to pay a few dollars, and he will not care about anything else. He is not an insurance company, so how can he guarantee that thousands of marriages will have satisfactory results? Moreover, the good days seen by the blind fortune tellers are nothing more than deceiving people and cheating money. When we get married, we don't ask a blind fortune teller, but because the superstitious power of society is too deep, we have to find a good day in the almanac. As a result, the day you find may be the same as the one the blind fortune teller found for you, so why give these few dollars to the blind fortune teller? However, if everyone is like me, the blind fortune tellers in Shanghai</p>

<p>I am afraid that there will be a panic about eating. Yesterday, October 29th of the old calendar was said to be a great good day in the second half of this year. Some blind fortune tellers may have held a blind person's meeting beforehand, so they picked this day as the wedding day for thousands of young men and women. But the panic has occurred. In Shanghai, although there are many restaurants and many hotels, yesterday, they really could not supply so many families getting married. There was too little porridge and too many monks. Those with long hands and fast feet had already booked the auditorium and found the hotel in advance. However, those who lacked experience in handling affairs and were unfamiliar with the situation in Shanghai went to find the auditorium and book the hotel very slowly. I am sorry, ten out of ten families have booked it. Even if you run all over the Chinese and French concessions, you can't find a place. It is said that like the Fuxing Garden on Wuma Road, people go to book the auditorium the year after the wedding. It is originally impossible to book if you are late! Thanks to the blind fortune tellers for fulfilling the wish of many young men and women. Yesterday's moment arrived. In the morning, all the hotels and auditoriums were hung with lights and decorated with red and green. From grandfathers to younger brothers, from grandmothers to modern girls, they all wore new clothes and went to eat wedding banquets. Which one of them didn't have a smiling face. In the streets, cars were flying red flags with [Happy Event at the Palace], picking up and dropping off guests, coming and going like shuttles. Trumpet bands, military bands, red and green, were running so busy. In the taverns, everyone was guessing fingers and shouting orders, making a lot of noise. In the streets, wedding sedan chairs were coming and going everywhere, and the sound of drums and music filled the sky, comparing to the lantern festival; a joyous atmosphere was revealed everywhere, and we cannot but congratulate the blind fortune tellers on their victory and success!</p>

<p>These past few days, the atmosphere in our noble school has been extremely tense. Why? Is it because the League of Nations is discussing the Manchurian Incident? Is it for helping the Northeast Volunteer Army? No, it's not. It turns out that the school authorities are holding a small exam. Everyone seems to be busy. The usually quiet study room has become unusually lively. Some are reading English textbooks, some are doing physics and chemistry exercises, and some are copying cheat sheets with characters as small as fly legs. At night, after the lights are turned off, candlelight continues to rise. In the morning; around four o'clock, there are many students in the tea room using electric lights to study. The sports field is deserted, and there are no athletes galloping. There are no couples talking in the campus: In short, everything has changed the state of the past. Ten minutes before each exam, the situation in the classroom can be said to be the most tense. Most of the students are holding textbooks to read or look at, as if they are unwilling to give up these last precious ten minutes, but a small number of students! Of course, they are already prepared, chanting English love songs leisurely, or chewing peanuts. During the exam, the classroom is quiet, and you can only hear the sound of the tip of the pen touching the paper and the slight sound of [Hey, pass the question No. ○ over]. The sharp eyes of the invigilator are constantly shooting around, but small pieces of paper are still being passed around from time to time. When he |the invigilator| stands up and walks over, our participating heroes have already sung the song of triumph. After the exam, the winners indeed have smiling faces and sing the song of triumph, but the losers hang their heads and complain, [Mr. A, thank you, please go outside to eat some refreshments], [Mr. B, you are too stingy, why didn't you pass the question No. ○ over?], such sounds are also spreading in the air after the exam.</p>

<p>Temporarily loosening the shackles of life, dragging my dry body, I went back on foot as usual. My stomach sometimes growled with hunger, because my pockets were always empty, so I had to be patient and rush forward. Strange! Tonight is a little different. I thought I would run faster as usual, but it was not as smooth as I imagined. My two feet were a little disobedient, and my stomach was even more uncomfortable. My eyes were a little dizzy when I saw the lights and gradually became blurry. I staggered through the crowd step by step. When I saw an alley near Sima Road, people were pushing and shoving extra busily. A burst of water vapor blew in, mixed with a greasy aroma. My nose felt unusually comfortable, and the saliva dripped down my mouth. My hungry intestines could no longer bear it. I walked in slowly, thinking that I was late coming out to wait for my salary today, no wonder my stomach was growling. Eat! Anyway, there is money in my pocket. I thought to myself and touched the smooth and slippery foreign coins in my pocket. I watched bowls of steaming spare rib noodles being sent over there. The urgency of my empty stomach finally couldn't be resisted, so I sat down. [What would you like to eat, sir?] A waiter wearing a white apron ran over. [Um, a bowl of noodles, spare rib noodles]. I thought that plain noodles were too monotonous and would be looked down upon by the waiter because the diners sitting around me were all working hard to promote the noodle restaurant. [Hey, another bowl, hurry up!] [Okay, sir, coming!] The waiter saw that my promotion ability was not weak and agreed very vigorously. While eating, I thought that the price of these two bowls of noodles, if I took them back, would probably feed my family for a day? Thinking of this, I regretted it a little. It would be enough to eat one bowl to fill my stomach. Why did I have to eat and add it like building a wall? Such expensive noodles, it doesn't matter if you don't eat them and let him be hungry for a while. It may not necessarily starve to death. The more I thought about it, the more I complained. I looked at the uneaten noodle soup and thought that the layer of oil beads on it was probably all made of blood and sweat? Don't waste it, drink it! I picked up the bowl and drank it all in one breath, without even leaving any noodle residue. [Sir, do you want more?] [No more! How much?] [Sir, forty cents! Haha... a hundred cents for a small bill!] I took out a warm foreign coin, gave it to the waiter to find six cents and a few hundred cash, picked it up and left. My two feet also had energy, and my stomach was so full that it was a little inconvenient to breathe. However, today's hard work was only for me to enjoy two bowls of [spare rib noodles] alone!</p>

<p>Old Man Wang is not only rich in property, but his young master is also so handsome and well-dressed, and is currently working in a bank. He has a promising future. Therefore, since the news of the marriage spread, matchmakers have been coming one after another, sending the eight characters of many young ladies to the Wang Mansion for selection. Mrs. Wang received thirty to fifty sets of eight characters and invited many fortune tellers to carefully calculate them one by one. Except for a few ill-fated beauties who were called [bankrupt], [widow], and [offending in-laws] by the blind fortune tellers, there were also a dozen or so girls who were so-called [prosperous and wealthy] and [beneficial to husband and children]. She didn't know which one to marry and was really hesitant. At first, she wanted to marry the one with the richest family among these eight characters, but she felt that in this world of the survival of the fittest, it was not enough to rely on wealth alone without power, and her husband was a businessman who always felt uneasy about selling inferior goods in the store, fearing being inspected and punished. If there was a powerful noble relative, she could rely on his power as a backing, so not only would she not be afraid of secretly smuggling, but she could also pack and transport</p>

Therefore, she could not reach high and could not reach low, and after expanding and going back, there was no suitable household. Later, she finally found an eight character set with money and power. It was the niece of a bureau chief. Her father was also a businessman who opened a shop, and this Miss Li was virtuous, filial, gentle, knowledgeable, and literate, and had good needlework skills. It was really rare to find such a woman nowadays. However, the old-fashioned Mrs. Wang still followed the old method she knew, which was completely irrational and almost superstitious. She pressed Miss Li's eight characters under the incense burner of the Kitchen God. It is said that [if there are no unexpected changes or unlucky things like bankruptcy within three days, these eight characters are the best, otherwise they are unlucky.] She firmly believes that this is the most appropriate and best way to determine the fate of Miss Li. However, on the evening of the same day, her ancestral white jade cup, which was her most beloved wine cup, was broken by her nephew. She suspected that Miss Li's eight characters were not good and that her fate carried a bankruptcy star. She felt unhappy in her heart. On the third day, she suddenly received a quick letter from her son. She hurriedly asked Mr. Huang next door to read the letter for her. She heard [the bank recently went bankrupt due to losses, her son has lost his job and is about to go home...] and ran angrily to the stove, took out the eight characters pressed under the incense burner, burned them on the fire, and cursed hatefully; [This kind of unlucky eight characters with a bankruptcy star are still sent to harm people!]</p>

<p>— Cheng Xun</p>
<p>Early in the morning, his wife spent an hour and a half dressing up. Finally, she gracefully draped herself in the new coat bought with his month's salary, like a butterfly, and flew out. Inside the room, he was left alone, blankly sitting in a chair.</p>
<p>He was stunned for a good while before slowly turning his head to look at the mess of perfume and powder on the dressing table, and the scattered long and short garments beside the bed. He couldn't help but sigh deeply, stood up, and began to wipe and tidy up everything. He also muttered to himself: [Is my wife, after all, happy?]</p>
<p>They had been married for over a year. Undoubtedly, before the marriage, each of them felt satisfied and content. However, from the perspective of their history after living together, the wife had discovered that he was an ordinary man without wealth or talent. He, on the other hand, bitterly believed that a woman who couldn't manage the household affairs was truly unworthy of being his wife. [Don't you see how considerate Miss Wang's partner is to her! Buying this and arranging that, and her social skills are so active. You only know how to drone on a few lines from books and bite on the end of your pen. You're really an incompetent bookworm. Wouldn't it be embarrassing for me to go out with you?]</p>
<p>[Learn from Mrs. Zhang! She manages the affairs of her home so well. Mr. Zhang is truly happy. Put the effort you spend on makeup and powder into housework! Going out today, leaving tomorrow, what kind of behavior is that?] They had said the above conversation more than once. The wife, as usual, was busy with social engagements and dancing, wearing different leather shoes every day and returning home late at night. She didn't bother to mend his socks, which had large holes, or wash his shirts, which had accumulated into a thick pile. Today, some girlfriend had invited her to dinner, so she took the only ten yuan from his pocket to go out. Poor him, he had planned to use that money to make a robe, but his wife, how could she care about such things!</p>
<p>All the past dissatisfactions and unsympathetic facts were now playing out in his mind like a running horse. He slumped down, looking at the wedding photo of the two of them hanging on the wall, feeling a sense of separation from another world. He couldn't bear it anymore and shouted loudly again: [Is my wife, after all, happy?]</p>
<h3 id="e224">Laughter <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Geng</p>
<p>Laughter is a unique human instinct, not found in other animals. For example, dragons roar, tigers howl, apes cry, cranes screech, chickens crow, and dogs bark. They can only produce a kind of uneven sound to express their inner feelings. Only humans, from infancy, can laugh before they can speak. The appearance of laughter is varied, including a gentle smile, a bright smile, a flattering smile, and a hearty laugh. People's false laughter is called ridicule, and mocking people's foolishness is called sarcastic laughter. There are many forms of laughter, too numerous to list. Now, let's discuss them based on the above.</p>
<p>(1) [A gentle smile] After the assassin Zheng Jicheng killed Zhang Zongchang, he was imprisoned in a cell. Someone took a photo of him and published it in the newspapers. His expression was [a gentle smile], smiling because his father's revenge had been avenged, or smiling because he could eliminate harm for the country, and his功 had been established. This is unknowable. This is one kind of laughter. (2) [A bright smile] After the Japanese single-handedly created the Manchurian state, Puyi, covered in sweat, sent envoys and Manchurian girls to Japan to present the national credentials in order to win a bright smile from the Japanese Emperor. This is one kind of laughter. (3) [A flattering smile] After the establishment of the puppet state, Puyi was the puppet leader, Xie Jieshi was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the old and unrepentant traitor Zheng Xiaoxu was the Prime Minister. The empty shell was fully displayed, and the situation of Zheng, Xie, and others giving flattering smiles to the Japanese is self-evident. This is also one kind of laughter.</p>
<p>(4) [Hearty laughter] and [Mocking laughter] On the 23rd of the month, at the League of Nations meeting in Geneva, our country's Dr. Gu Weijun refuted the fallacies of the Japanese envoy Matsuoka Yosuke, saying that if boycotting Japanese goods is a disguised form of war, then China welcomes Japan's discrimination against the Chinese, but does not welcome Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces. At this point, the whole place burst into laughter. This kind of laughter is mocking the Japanese's delusional attempt to swallow the three northeastern provinces, or mocking China's lack of goods being boycotted by the Japanese. This is one kind of laughter.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Origin of the Shop Assistant Communication Column <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>During this 60th-anniversary celebration, our newspaper, in order to contribute to the business community of this port, has established a circulating library and published a weekend periodical for amateurs. Now, we feel that the social environment of this port is complex, especially for shop assistants and apprentices in various stores and companies, who have more opportunities to contact society due to the nature of their work. Under these circumstances, whether from a social or personal perspective, many difficult problems are bound to arise. However, individual knowledge is ultimately limited, and only by pooling collective wisdom can we achieve the effect of mutual learning. Therefore, we have specially opened a "Shop Assistant Communication" column to welcome everyone to raise various difficult questions. We are willing to do our best to discuss them with everyone sincerely, hoping to find a relatively proper and satisfactory solution. If we encounter topics that are beyond our ability to answer, we will invite experts to explain them. Shop Assistant Communication Column Regulations (1) Purpose of Communication: The purpose of this column is to pool collective wisdom, explain difficult problems, learn from each other, and enhance the happiness of life. (2) Target Audience: The target audience of this column is limited to shop assistants and apprentices in terms of people, and limited to this port in terms of location. (3) Content of Communication: All questions about personal daily life, such as: (1) Occupation, (2) Moral and academic cultivation, (3) Entertainment and sports, (4) Marriage, etc., as well as other questions related to the country and society, are welcome. If the content of the question is too profound and beyond the ability of this column, it can also be introduced to this newspaper's [Reader Advisory] to answer it on our behalf.</p>
<p>(4) Method of Letter Submission: (1) The letter must clearly state the name, age, native place, occupation, and detailed mailing address; the same information must be provided in subsequent letters. (2) The writing style of the letter is not limited, but it should be simple and easy to understand, and it must be written clearly. (3) Please write "Shen Bao Newspaper, This Port Supplement, Shop Assistant Communication Column" on the envelope; if a reply is needed, please attach a two-cent stamp. (4) Communicators must cut out the special stamp issued by this column and paste it on the upper left corner of the letter; letters without the stamp will not be answered. (5) Processing Method After Receiving Letters: (1) Any questions discussed that this newspaper deems to have value in contributing to the public may be disclosed in the newspaper. (2) In order to respect the opinions of the communicator, if the letter states that the writer does not want their name disclosed or requires a private response, it will be handled accordingly. (3) If the communicator hopes to disclose the letter in the newspaper, but the length is too long to be fully disclosed, the main points will be published. In addition, if the content of the question is complex and requires careful study, resulting in a delayed response or disclosure, readers are requested to understand. (4) When there is a backlog of letters, answers will be given in the order in which they were received, and any delays are requested to be understood.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(1) Tian The weather in the south of the Yangtze River after May is already unbearably hot. However, the villagers in the countryside are busy harvesting barley and starting to plant rice. The plants and trees are also as excited as the farmers, vigorously growing outwards. The entire plain is covered with paddy fields. The rice seedlings have pierced the surface of the water in the fields and are already more than a foot long. If people look at the plain from a distance, they will see green everywhere. The plain is surrounded by green trees on all sides, except for the distant green mountains. This is not because the villagers planted trees to surround the paddy fields. Because the trees scattered in various places on the plain, regardless of whether they are dense or sparse, no matter where you look, you always feel that you are standing in a suitable location. Beyond the trees all around, it is the green sky like a dome, and you feel that the trees are linked together. It is noon, and a few white clouds float in the sky, further embellishing the green fields and making them bright and open. Occasionally, large white egrets fly out of the green paddy fields, which is even more poetic. Perhaps some people have appreciated the beauty of this great nature. Suddenly, a burst of singing rises from the green fields. He sings: Looking from afar, oh elder sister, walking all the way, applying half a catty of powder on your face. Looking up close, you look like a hanging ghost. Looking from afar, you look like a fox spirit, oh fox spirit! Almost scared the soul out of this talented brother, oh. The person seemed to be very happy singing. After finishing one song, he sang another song: The sun sets down, the birds in the pond, the sister washing in the room... [Hey! Second brother! Stop singing. There's a woman walking past on the road over there.] [What does it matter? A song can't be sung without a lover or sister.] A farmer with a weeding sickle in his hand was weeding in the field. A college student who had returned to his hometown from the city was walking with his hands behind his back on the bank of the field and talking to him. The farmer was called Wang Laoer, and the student was Meng Guobao. They were from the same village, but Meng Guobao had always studied in the provincial capital and rarely returned to his hometown. Even recently, he hadn't returned for three years. Because he was studying social science, he felt that China's rural economy had collapsed in recent years, so he deliberately went to the countryside to investigate the conditions of the rural society. As a child is fond of sweets all the year round, so the time was idle and he went to the field to see the work of the farmers. He heard Wang Laoer singing a song that was almost indecent, so he interrupted his singing and said with a smile, "Although a song can't be sung without a lover or sister, there are many things to say about lovers and sisters. Why do you have to sing such an unpleasant one?" Laoer's sickle scraped back and forth in the mud, splashing the water, and he lowered his head, panting and laughing, "Nine out of ten songs are from Dong, and one that's not from Dong is still proper. Isn't everyone singing like that? If women hear it, they hear it. Anyway, it's just that kind of thing." Meng Guobao saw that the small bamboo hat he was wearing couldn't cover the back of his neck, but he draped a long blue cloth over his shoulders to block the strong sunlight. He exposed a large section of his back, and his skin was tanned yellow and black, and he even smeared it with a layer of grease, making it look almost like cowhide. His upper body had been tempered and he was not wearing clothes. Even his lower body, a pair of blue cloth trousers, had the trouser legs rolled up and flattened his leg grooves. If he removed that draped blue cloth, he would be close to a person from the primitive era who was wearing leaves.</p>
