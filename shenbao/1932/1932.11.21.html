<h3 id="c1">入超激增與外人在華金融勢力之活躍乃 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>吾國近數年來。國際貿易。輸出日就式微。輸入孟晋不已。入超之數。民十八猶僅關平二萬五千萬兩。民十九增至四萬一千四百萬兩。民二十又增至五萬二千五百萬兩。迨及今年。則至九月份爲止。已達四萬四千六百萬兩之鉅。預計全年入超。恐須在六萬萬兩以上。而同時往昔賴以抵補入超調劑國際收支之華僑匯欵。復因世界恐慌及各處限制華僑入口之故。逐年减少。一面入超激增。而一面匯入欵項減退。處此兩重打擊之下。吾人果何所恃以應付國際間之債務乎。</p>
<p>因外人金融勢力之存在。復因外人在華金融組織。完全不受我國政府之監督與檢查。研究中國國際收支之清算。遂成爲極複雜之問題。惟吾人當研究此複雜問題之際。其不能置外人在華金融事業之狀况於度外。自無容疑。外人在華之金融勢力。其可供吾人之研究者。則爲本埠各洋商銀行之庫存。</p>
<p>在去年十一月間。本埠各洋商銀行之庫存。爲銀兩三千四百萬兩。銀元二千三百萬元。迨及今日。則庫存銀兩達九千六百萬兩。銀元三千五百萬元。一年之間。增加銀兩六千二百萬兩銀元二百萬元之鉅。銀行之庫存。一部分爲發行及營業之準備。而另一部分。則爲游資。即可以貸放而一時未得適當貸放途徑之資金。内中準備之數。往往無急劇之變遷。而游資之數。則因非銀行自身之所能控制。變動往往甚厲。外商銀行一年來所增加之鉅數庫存。其什九屬於游資。蓋無疑也。</p>
<p>此洋商銀行金庫中所增加之鉅額游資。其來源不出二端。其一。爲由華商銀行提出移存洋商銀行之存欵。其二。爲貿易入超結果流入外人手中之現金。惟過去一年中。不僅洋商銀行之庫存激增。華商銀行之庫存現金。亦增加甚速。此足證第一項由華商銀行移存洋商銀行之欵項。並無堪以注意之數目。而一年來洋商銀行金庫中所增之游資。殆幾盡爲第二項因入超結果流入外人手中之現金。蓋内地人民。因購用進口洋貨。金錢由商人之手。流入上海。復因出口土貨之無人過問。流入上海之金錢。無由再流向内地。同時更以充國際間付欵之用之黃金。歷年輸出。搜括殆盡。此流入上海之現銀。遂無法換取黃金綑載以去。乃遂留滯其間。而成爲外人在洋商銀行中之存欵耳。</p>
<p>洋商銀行因游資之充斥。遂不得不亟覓運用之途徑。因之。數月以前。遂有匯豐銀行對京滬鐵路之放欵。最近。復有外國銀團對於本市復興公債之承受。而轟動一時之中國營業公司。對於招商局四棧之受押。要亦洋商銀行游資充斥。找求出路之一種行動而已耳。</p>
<p>吾人歸納上文之編列。可知目下一部分入超之抵補。實經由下列之方式。貿易入超丨丨洋商銀行所有之游資丨丨外人在華之投資及債權</p>
<p>國人如不健忘。或猶能憶及前年美商對於上海公共租界工部局電氣處之。收買。其收買代價達八千萬兩之鉅。此外如年來本埠日人紗廠之擴充。與各種外人經營產業之創。設要皆爲抵償貿易入超之一種方式也。</p>
<p>復有須注意者。則如上文所述。游資云者。尙不過一部分可以貸放而一時尙無法貸放之資金。易言之則游資以外。自尙有多數業經妥爲貸放之資金。而就常理以推測。此業經貸放之資金。自必遠大於游資之數目。以故一年間洋商銀行金庫中所增游資之數。雖僅六千餘萬兩。而流入洋商銀行之現金數。必猶數倍於此也</p>
<p>本文之旨趣。不過指出目下外人在華金融勢力活動之因果關係。一所以示入超之抵補。自有相當實質之代價。而决無任何意外之便宜而吾國目下之貿易狀態。已如中落之家。因連年入不敷出之結果。甚至須舉債以購日用之所需。二所以示外人之投資。均有其必然的背景與原因。而决非所以求好於任何人。其貸欵與我也。固决非有愛於我。亦自有其不得已之苦衷。故當其衝者。儘可堅守一已之立場。取得適宜之條件。倘屈辱以求全。或色然以自矜。必徒爲外人所竊笑。若招商局四棧之抵押。支付甚高之利率給與極大之回扣。復至斷送其管理權。其爲愚昧無識。實已百喙難辭。有否别情。無俟具論。若夫利用外資之利弊。則不在本文討論之範圍。</p>
<h3 id="c2">國際聯盟今日開會中日問題先作非公開接洽松岡昨與美代表交換意見正式討論恐將延至星期三 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>▲路透社二十日日内瓦電國聯行政院星期一日將不討論李頓報告書、大約延至星期三日始討論之、星期一日將舉行非公開集會、以便處理尋常問題、未必有公開會議也、談判者現擬覓一適中之途徑、以便利討論之進行、每屆行政院開會、輒先由秘書處預備議事程序、但此次秘書處亦覺難以着手、日本對李頓報告書之意見書、其節略定今日在倫敦·華盛頓·東京·三處發表、日代表松岡昨晤美代表台維斯、歷一小時半之久、行政院議長伐勒拉亦在座、</p>
<p>▲電通社二十日日内瓦電國聯理事會議長伐勒拉·國聯事務總長德魯蒙、日本全權松岡、接洽之結果、臨時理事會、决定二十一日上午十一時、（上海時間午後六時）開會、開會最初之十分乃至二十分、因議題之確定、其他之手續等、並不公開、其後始行公開、由伐勒拉議長、宣布討論中日問題後、即由松岡代表演說、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社二十日日内瓦電明日開會之國聯會行政院議事日程中、列入中國政府之申請、李頓報告書之考慮、及玻里維亞與巴拉圭兩國間之爭執、此事業已委託三國委員會審議、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社二十日日内瓦電國聯會日本代表團方面徵實、謂將向軍縮大會主席團提出關於海軍軍縮之建議、日本代表團、須審議滿洲問題及發表對於李頓報告書之正式意見書、故提出關於軍縮之建議、不免遲延、此項建議、當在本星期以内發表云、</p>
<p>▲國民社十九日華盛頓電美官塲聞日本將在國聯、引美國取得巴拿馬運河讓與權之行動、爲其在滿軍事行動辯護之訊、今日羣起痛駁、謂兩者絶不相同、第一、華府九國公約與凱洛格白里安非戰公約、皆係在巴拿馬運河區域讓與美國以後締結簽訂、而美國今日之遠東政策、則以此兩約爲基礎、</p>
<p>第二、兩者亦罕見有相同之點、查巴拿馬曾背叛哥倫比亞多年、至一九○三年十一月三日乃宣告獨立、後十日得美國承認、又越二日美巴始簽訂條約、由美國出欵二千五百萬元、購得開鑿運河權、迨一九二四年舊約期滿、乃於一九二六年續訂新約、更明白規定兩國權利、美國允在運河區域、不經營足與巴拿馬共和國實業競爭之任何企業、而巴拿馬共和國、則允遇美國與他國發生戰爭時、彼亦認爲在戰爭狀態、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十日倫敦電觀察報評論明日國聯行政院處理李頓報告書事、謂就日代表松岡之言論察之、顯見此事難點、在東三省所可有自主權之正確性質、松岡於非正式陳述日本要求時、曾用「地方自主」字樣、雖日内瓦行將表示之意見、不盡與李頓及松岡相同、但預料未有意見大相逕庭之理由云、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十日倫敦電星期時報今日紀日内瓦所將討論之各問題、謂全世界今處於刃邊、日本恫嚇國聯、如國聯贊同李頓報告書、則彼將脫離國聯、國聯今須事對府、而軍縮會議亦仍未有所决議、前泰晤士報記者著名政治著作家史悌德稱、假使日本退出行政院、則行政院與國聯特會、必須考慮本年三月十一日特會一致所通過之决議案、應否由其他會員國連同美國予以維持、而用以爲一種工具、並當維持至若何程度、至須連同美國者、因將援引凱洛格非戰公約故也、又謂無論日本脫離國聯與否、而其拒絶李頓報告書、實可造成極嚴重之局勢、軍縮會議之成敗、或將視國聯維持李頓報告書之堅决與否爲定云、按三月十一日之决議案、爲第二次結果、表示國聯大會抱自由主義者之勝利、該决議案特殊聲明、國聯大會、討論爭案全部後、决定凡在軍事壓力下所成之任何解决、皆屬違反國聯盟約、凡用違反國聯盟約或巴黎非戰公約之方法所成立之局勢或條約、皆不能認爲有效、</p>

<p>一、「滿洲國」獨立及帝國之承認該國、爲嚴然之旣成事實、絶對不容取消與曖昧化、</p>
<p>一、國聯靜觀「滿洲國」之推移、似較爲妥當、其靜觀方法、若爲肘制日本或係阻害「滿洲國」之發展等之方法、則斷然排擊、　　一、若勸告中日直接交涉時、應合中日與「滿洲國」代表、直接交涉絶對排擊第三國之參與、絶對反對援助交涉之國際委員會之設立、</p>
<p>一、國聯若爲不承認「滿洲國」之决議、乃至共同聲明、則日本即使退出國聯、亦所斷然反對、</p>

<p>▲電通社二十日東京電國聯理事會關於滿洲問題、將以季頓報告書爲中心在世界輿論之前、加以討論、故將自二十一日起、在日内瓦開會論議、日本將以松岡首席代表以下、立於陣前、披瀝帝國之所信、以啓列國之蒙、今日内田外相發表談話如下、</p>
<p>帝國之行動、始終公正、毫無歉疚之處、即於國聯會議、亦出以正正堂堂之態度、故無虚僞策動之必要、其形勢若何、實難預測、若依滿洲現地之事實、懇切說明其事實、則深信國聯方面、亦將承認日方之主張也、所謂國聯對策者、祗以滿洲現地尊重主義進行、故所以特派松岡氏爲代表者、因氏通曉日本輿論、及「滿洲國」之實情與滿洲問題故也、現信賴同氏之努力、此次打破所謂訓令外交之弊、與代表部以廣汎自由斟酌之權限、而期望其活躍也、即於滿洲問題、亦祇希望承認日帝國牢固之承認之事實、而非要求國聯立即承認「滿洲國」、故無與國聯正面衝突之虞、國聯若熟讀審議日本之意見書則確信會議必能圓滿進行也云、</p>

<p>吾人以深甚之關心、對於國聯於李頓報告書、及帝國政府意見書、與「滿洲國」之嚴然之存在、並於帝國承認「滿洲國」等之方式、將求如何之回答、是堪注目、吾人决心早已决定、今更不待煩言、即使與國聯爲正面之衝突、亦非得已、而祇敢然向所信邁進而已、吾人之意見書、可謂完成李頓報告書、滿洲問題、由日滿兩國、即可解决、而在國聯、由中國及其他諸國加以承認、則爲殘餘問題也、紙上空談一再爲之實導事　更爲糾紛、實有誤國聯自身之使命、李頓報告書、認將滿洲恢復至九一八以前狀態、爲不滿足然恢復日本承認以前之狀態、亦屬不可能之事、然列國承認「滿洲國」存在之旣成事實、爲解决問題之最良策也、而諸國從事無視正義之法律論、而以推對日之傾向、實遺憾之至、深望毌出之歧途、以導國聯於危境、而確信吾人之所志得貫徹於此次之理事會也云、（日政府意見書載後）</p>

<p>已由外務省正式公表</p>
<p>誣衊我民國不堪卒讀</p>
<p>我國當局應嚴詞駁斥</p>
<p>▲電通社二十日東京電帝國政府對於李頓報告書所提出於國聯之帝國政府意見之大要如下、已由外務省於二十一日上午另時公布、</p>
<p>▲緒論帝國政府致謝調查團之努力、惟因調查期間、較爲短期、故委員所得之印象、實有皮相之感、一行之未及訪問華南、致於報告時所載如無樂觀、是所思惟、報告時無疑係以誠意所書者、而提出於委員之材料之選擇取拾、感其有誤、即於新聞記事、個人通信、私的談話置以基礎、固甚明瞭、而苦於斷定其價値、其證據所使用者、祇不利於日本之時、尤於九一八事件、滿洲國成立較爲顯著也、前者對於日軍行動之動機、根本誤解、後者關於滿洲統治之將來、於報告書之他部分之主旨、於現實事態、未見一致、最後報告書、於日本方面、如對中國國民藏有深切之反感而與以暗示、此實與事實相反、而日本則希望兩國永遠之親善也、</p>
<p>▲第一章中國第一章中國、計分㈠一般考察、㈡在華之排外活動、㈢變則的在華外人之地位等三項、㈠一般考察、中國非有統一之國家、㈡國民政府之促進排外敎育、殊於抵制之責任、國民黨即國民政府應負之、述日本爲其最大之被害者、㈢述變則的在華人之地位、列國於華有治外法權於大津漢口上海及其他土地、當租界之警察行政、以武力直接保護其權利、因派駐必要之軍隊等、述此項特殊之地位、并述現在之和平機關、若如中國之國家、適用困難、</p>
<p>▲第二章滿洲國第二章滿洲國分㈠一般考察、㈡張家之非政、㈢日本之特殊地位、㈣對於日本地位之侵害等四項、㈠於一般考察指摘滿洲本來非中國之完全之一部、㈡述張家在滿洲之非政、㈢力說日本在滿洲之特殊地位、並日本之文化的功績、㈣述對於日本地位之中國之侵害、以對於南滿鐵道之中國方面之包圍政策、爲殊甚加妨害於行使商租權及其他條約上之權利、壓迫日本臣民、尤其於在滿鮮人、中村大尉事件等、中國方面之攻擊日本之態度與九一八之爆破事件、主張華兵之行爲、非無故之事實云、</p>
<p>▲第三章九一八事件及其後之軍事行動第三章述九一八事件及其後之軍事行動、謂日軍之行動、未逸出任何自衛之範圍、帝國政府於該行動究否必要、或是否妥當、不容外間之議論、</p>
<p>▲第四章新國家第四章分甲乙丙三項、甲、謂滿洲國之成立、滿洲國之獨立運動之詳細、東京參謀本部實指導并援助該運動、係完全與事實相反、謂日本方面無參與獨立運動之事實、乙、爲滿洲國住民之態度、列舉報告書置信於不知素性之千五百五十封華人之書信、并舉其於甚多書信、表示不滿、并述滿洲國住民繼續歡迎新政府之意、丙、爲滿洲國之組織及其將來、對於治安之恢復及財政二點、特喚起注意、反駁日本支配滿洲國之誤測、指摘日滿議定書之任何規定、並不違背國際任何義務之事實、</p>
<p>▲第五章結論以上所述各節槪括如下、一、中國近乎無政府而在混亂狀態、設此事態而持續、則不外視在國家的崩壞之狀態也、惟在有鞏固且有永續性之中央政府時期、則於究極或有之而難豫斷、二、其結果中國不能充分保護外人之生命財產、尤其於内爭之深刻化、所謂革命外交等之結果、其情况較爲顯著者也、三、然列國維持治外法權租界與駐屯軍、於内河則常駐軍艦等、繼續世界無類之例外的權力與特權之行使、四、因中國之無政府狀態、由排外政策而蒙最大之被害者爲日本、五、日本與滿洲、於歷史的地理的、有緊密之關係、在該地有莫大之經濟的利益及重大條約上之權利、同時并有多數之居留民加之、由國家安全之見地、於政治上戰略上、對於滿洲有重大之關係、終之、日本在滿洲之地位、無可比類、係特殊例外者也、六、舊滿洲官吏擬覆上述之特殊地位、而爲策動、尤於張學良之接近國民政府後、對於日本權益之侵迫、頻繁熾烈、日本雖努力於緩和此形勢、而竟召此緊張事態、七、九一八事件、於該緊迫空氣裏所起事件之當時、或其後日本軍所採之措置、皆未逸出自衛權之範圍、由公平視之、他國於同一條件、亦必出同一行動也、八、滿洲對於中國本部、在地理的歷史的、係於别個之地位、其往民增惡張家之暴政、反對以滿洲投入中國本部政爭之漩渦中、爲「保境安民」之運動、創立滿洲國之說係根據此運動與以清朝復辟運動爲主動力之滿洲往民之自發的行爲、滿洲國於穩健政策之下、堅實進行、其將來極爲有望、</p>
<p>最後日本對於建設滿洲國之態度及正式承認、並不違反任何國際條約、更形强調者爲中國問題、於滿洲問題之複雜性爲尤甚、其變則的特色、其類例實無可尋覔、此項處置、若應用普通國際問題之一般的法式、則較困難、關於如斯變則的問題之手續、又解决、不能以通常適用於國際紛爭之先例爲之、此固如報告書所述者也、</p>
<p>以上對於中國問題、基於帝國政府之基本見解、述報告書第九章與第十章所書諸點、報告書排斥恢復事前之狀態、并於承認現政權之維持、亦爲不滿足之解决、帝國政府對於如是之解决、並不違背國際義務之根本原則、並與滿洲住民之希望一致、且華人於斯解决、確信係安定中日關係之唯一的基礎、若解除正在堅實發達之新國家、即置此新國家於國際的孤立、報告書所謂並非適合於現實的事態、日本與滿洲國之關係、不能放棄於永不安定之狀態、故帝國政府望列國速承認滿洲國、并協力使之發達安定滿洲之事態、俾遠東和平、是爲唯一之方法也、此即日本所以署名於九一五之議定書者也、報告書中所謂事態並不停止謂滿洲問題之特色、實意味深長、當參酌委員等之意見檢討報告書、理事會關於其後刻刻推移之事態、希望爲充分之理解與滿足之情報、該事態之推移於中國本部反依然繼續混亂、而滿洲國則逐步趨向發達而帝國政府、常準備供給此種情報、第十章之解决提案中勸告中日兩國直接交涉、謂此非委員會之職能、是項提案、祗意味實現第九章原則之方法之一例耳、日本所述急速承認滿洲國者、以爲由日本之承認、或可多少抹殺該提案之重要性、蓋委員會曾謂日本即使承認新國家而於報告書則或能有所效力、而用漠然之言辭出之、故日本乃爲上述之言也、由以上之見解、帝國政府之見解係、㈠如後所述報告書第九章中之原則第十、恐絡於中國本部之國際管理、同樣於第十章中關於滿洲之諸提議、設加以實施、則將召滿洲之假裝的國際管理、此爲滿洲國與日本之所同難受諾者也、㈡此項提議、實過於精密煩雜實不合遠東現實之事態、委員會所提出之案、須以紛爭國有鞏固且安定之中央政府、爲最少限度之前提、如滿洲問題無先例而有複雜性、然統治國之一方如無鞏固且得信賴之中央政府時、而加以適用、則徒使事態之糾紛耳、㈢撤廢滿洲之軍備、如祗以國際憲兵隊維持和平秩序等案、則不得不認係完全不合現實之事態也、如是難副滿洲住民之希望、同時恐釀成日本所欲阻止之該地之不安與混亂、此較恢復原狀、比事態惡化爲更大也、若論第九章中抽象的諸原則、若於中國無强固之中央政府則不能適用甚明、故在現在繼續無政府狀態中、不發生適用此等問題而無國際的協力、而欲實現强固之中央政府、殆不可能、該國際協力、若不出於何項國際管理之形式、則殆不能想像也、日本不能拱手以待中國之再建、因上述之故、現於恢復之途之和平與秩序、因有破壞之虞、故無論何案必召新紛爭與困難也、然努力於滿洲事態之安定、豈非眞有經綸乎、對於過去二十年間中國之再興表示多大之忍耐與同情之世界、對於滿洲新國家、有理解與希望者、非可加以歡迎乎、又重大之中國問題、由自體之解决、實甚單純化者也、</p>

<p>東華六比零勝優游</p>
<p>｜阿迦爾與西捕甲組中二支勁旅｜</p>
<p>西聯足球會甲組聯賽、轉輾循環、已届短兵相見之期、精兵强旅、須相見一决勝負昨日甲組賽中、阿迦爾對臘克斯一役最惹人注意、阿迦爾爲威德夏之替身、其實力喧騰一時、而威德夏又遺下可觀之成績以去、故阿迦爾初次獻身、倍增注意、果然於跑馬廳中、以六比二大勝實力雄厚之臘克斯、東華再戰優游、則東華以六比零大勝　　▲阿迦爾克臘克斯</p>
<p>▲六比二▲</p>
<p>｜威德夏之替身可怕｜</p>
<p>▲有諾森堡之風采蘇格蘭軍阿迦爾爲個個挺硬之球隊、一目了然、脚頭脆爽非凡、攻力勝於守、前鋒之中、人材濟濟、而左翼勝於右、中鋒克拉格左内拉蒙德、及左翼休士三人、常有美妙合作、右翼麥克泰維許則稍忽遲慢而已、中線未見如何出色、送球尙佳、右前麥克格來新位置無定、能引敵入内、後衛堅强、下半時甚穩健、上半時曾見疏漏數次、守門亨德、不在台維特之下、上半時有極妙之救球數次、全隊工夫、大有去秋諾森堡之風采、個個勇猛非常、</p>
<p>▲臘克斯先聲奪人結果六比二、然臘克斯先中二球、後輪六隻、上半時之結果二比二平手、上塲臘克斯堅壁以守、阿迦爾屢攻不得、竟未能越雷池一步、阿隊以中衛之不嚴守、推納亞爾傑常左右並進、進叩李迦爾之門、十五分鐘後、十分鐘之内湯勃列尼與亞爾傑連中敵門二次、滿塲相顧而驚、爲新軍危、</p>
<p>▲阿迦爾連中六次阿迦爾於是一方嚴守、一方則乘機急進、前鋒迅速如飛、右翼泰非許角球傳中、拉蒙德砰然射入、克拉格繼之又中、上半時遂成一比二、下半時上塲僅十分鐘阿迦爾又中、左翼休士在左角斜射、竟中門角而落入臘克斯之勇氣遂烟銷雲散、軍無鬥志、此後全是阿迦爾局面、滿城風雨、片刻不安、麥達手觸皮球、海司帝輕輕罰入十二碼、成五比二、克拉格最後之一頂、六比二完塲、</p>
<p>▲昨日雙方之射門臘克斯昨日上半時之射門機會時有失之、不準者亦多、運氣不佳者亦有、二比二上半時將終結時、一次在門前連射數次、準而有力、皆中守門之身或手、以致彈回、實堪惋惜、阿迦爾之射門、有力而準、喜盤旋門前至可射射之、使不虚發、一次中鋒猛射、適中門上之木、遠遠彈回、皆爲臘克斯慶、然臘克斯終歸失散、</p>

<p>▲東華二次敗優游</p>
<p>▲六比零▲</p>
<p>｜雙方動作俱欠和平｜</p>
<p>東華足球隊昨與優游隊再戰於中華棒球場結果在華以六比零勝、觀者無幾、球賽亦少興趣、茲紀其經過如下、</p>
<p>▲東華陣線</p>
<p>曹象華</p>
<p>李　寗　　屠開元　陳洪光</p>
<p>周賢言　　　　　　馮運佑　李義臣</p>
<p>關洵安　　吳幼良　陳家球</p>
<p>陳虞添</p>
<p>▲優游陣線</p>
<p>沈柏貴</p>
<p>朱　　　葉晉綿　沈惠培</p>
<p>梁官濂　　　　　王樹森　王章寳</p>
<p>錢耀彬　陳士芳　奚巧生</p>
<p>朱生發</p>
<p>▲上半時情形全局形勢、係向一面傾倒、優游雖努力抵抗、卒難保龍門之不失、先由東華屠開元在離門三十碼處遠射球勢頗急正中門内、往後陳洪光與陳家球、亦先後建功、上半時成三比零、</p>
<p>▲下半時情形再戰聲中、屠開元向優游球門踼任意球、一脚送去、球爲李義臣得、一舉成功、爲時無幾、陳虞添之傳中、萬象華頭頂亦中、繼而李義臣單獨攻入一球、結果遂成六比零、</p>
<p>▲優游缺大將第一戰東華與優游之戰、結果爲三比零、昨戰則倍之、優游前鋒主將董小培因病未能出場進攻力量、乃益爲薄弱、</p>
<p>▲戰後之批評昨戰雙方動作、均欠和平、優游中鋒因行動失檢誤撞對手、曾經裁判員罰出、西聯會向來對於球員有不合法之行動者必加以懲戒、幸吾華隊健兒、莫步後塵、卽使身當其衝者、亦不可存報復之念幸各勉之、</p>
<p>▲甲組目下之形勢</p>
<p>｜東華曁南皆須努力｜</p>
<p>甲組錦標之形勢、自西捕以一比二勝曁南、昨日阿迦爾以六比二克臘克斯後、有牽動全局之可能、</p>
<p>▲埠際猛將入西捕天津埠際名將派克、加入西捕充中鋒、西捕頓添一支生力軍、前鋒增加力量、無止數信、而推納仍回居後衛、又加銅牆一座、中衛線不必談、可稱完全之陣線、僅許德稍微見善、故史高托杯旣六比零淘汰臘克斯昨五比二勝曁南已完全恢復原狀、東華今日對之、恐無當初之容易、而錦標希望、西捕仍高、雖目下言之尙早、</p>
<p>▲勁敵當推阿迦爾西捕之外、其次之勁敵、卽爲阿迦爾矣、阿軍承威德夏之後、僅有一次之敗續、以昨日之成績觀之、在東華曁南當具戒心、曁南在甲組第一週中尙須逢臘克斯法商阿迦爾等、其努力更當加倍於東華也、</p>

<p>▲昨日以三比二擊敗勃倫芝</p>
<p>｜林寳華梅迪摩得混合錦標｜</p>
<p>硬地網球賽、已於昨日在法商總會閉幕、最後兩幕决賽、爲男子單打及混合雙打、均有精彩表演、余田光不因裁判員巡邊員之錯誤、而失去希望、卒以三比一擊敗勃倫芝、奪得錦標、林寳華與一老太　梅迪摩夫人、在極微之希望中、挽救危局、比二比一勝勃倫芝與杜佛芝夫人、亦榮　軍冠焉、茲紀其經過如下、</p>
<p>六｜四</p>
<p>二｜六</p>
<p>余田光　六｜三　勃倫芝</p>
<p>五｜七</p>
<p>六｜四</p>
<p>死裏逃生　一時半單打决赛開始、余田光發塲先攻、先攻先負兩局後以一比三負、力戰成三比三、又成三比四卒成四比四、余用力發球、奪回一局、乃以五比四死裏逃生、初茲頭角以六比四結果首盤、歸小余勝利</p>
<p>▲一敗塗地第二盤上、余之抽擊、每觸網下、殊少建樹對手勃倫芝攻勢甚猛、連　三局、繼成五比一、小余一敗塗地雖爭回第一局、卒以二比六敗北、</p>
<p>▲再佔優先第三盤起、小余謹愼作戰正反抽擊、均極硬勁、勃倫芝亦不示弱、雙方接戰甚烈、初則形勢平均、自三比三後、小余一氣呵成、以六比三再估優先、</p>
<p>▲寃聲不絶下一盤小余聲勢益盛、發球有力、抽擊銳利、志在操得勝劵、曾以四比一局佔絶端優勢無如以後數局、余之發球、屢被裁判員判爲「脚誤一、余於是心虚膽怯、頓失去其管束力、遂被勃倫芝乘機進攻、以七比五反敗爲勝、小余之敗、良可惋惜若余之發球爲脚誤則勃倫芝之「行走發球」、更爲「脚誤」、但裁判員竟未判罰一次故無不爲余田光呌寃、</p>
<p>▲再接再厲余田光戰戰兢兢、力事振作、第五盤上余每佔優先、勃倫芝雖努力追隨不稍示弱但自四比四後、卒以脚步慌亂、失分頻見連負兩局以六比四歸余勝利、余遂以三比二奪得錦標、</p>
<p>五｜七</p>
<p>林寳華　六｜二勃倫芝</p>
<p>梅迪摩　七｜五杜佛茲</p>
<p>繼上組而起者、爲混合雙打决賽、林寳華梅迪摩夫人、對單打决賽失敗之勃倫芝與草地網球單打冠軍杜佛茲夫人、林之配搭梅夫人、年事較高、球藝轉差杜夫人球藝硬勁、不可多見故勃倫芝頗得其𦔳、觀者咸以爲錦標將歸勃杜組林本人亦作如是想、不料結果竟得其反、林寳華苦戰一場不負苦心、誠喜出望外、</p>
<p>▲先負首盤開始交鋒、開始交鋒、勃倫芝先行開球、每以先勝奪人、佔優一局、由林寳華組平均之、林組之勝可謂全得力於林一人、梅夫人鮮有建樹、對手則頗爲平均、五比五局後、勃杜二人連加兩局、以七比五勝、</p>
<p>▲奪回利權天賦幸事、命該得勝、第二盤上梅夫人忽然得神抽擊有力、深人底線、林寳華如虎添翼益爲奮鬭、連得四局、殊爲容易、是盤結果、林梅以六比二勝、挽回利權、</p>
<p>▲一團福氣第三盤爲勝負關鍵、雙方小心應戰、各不示弱、但開始時梅夫人又現不支、失誤累累林寳華獨當一面究有顧此失彼之憾以致連失一局、岌岌可怖、不料否極泰來、胖團團之梅夫人、福星高照、頓又一變其軟弱之態抖擻精神、一再建樹、林得其助力連下四局、反以四比三佔優、無如以下兩局、各一得失、林梅仍以四比五屈居下風、下局爲梅夫人發球、觀者咸爲之擔憂、以爲其軟弱無力之發球、必凶多吉少、安知竟勝是局、千鈞一髮、安然度過、於是林組希望來矣、當勃倫芝發球、林寳華力戰奪回、下局輪與林寳華發球、如囊探物、乃以七比五得最後勝利、說者雖謂係林之功夫、有以致之、然梅夫人之福氣、亦不可没、其技術雖屬平庸、但昨在緊要關頭、竟能隨心所欲、從容控制實爲致勝之主因也</p>

<h3 id="c150">救國的念秧 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>掛着救國幌子而在暗幕内實行其念秧的工作，自從九一八以來，這把戲已頑過了好多次，最近，廣州香港往來的西安號輪船，其中有一個郭姓的少年，也來頑這一套把戲，可惜被人識破而終於失敗；足見古人說的「作僞心勞日拙」這一句話·確有相當的價値。</p>
<p>西安號在本月上旬從香港開往廣州的過程中，有一個住在西餐樓十號房間的少年郭某，表現着一種沉痛和沮喪的態度，跨出船欄，要向大海茫茫中覓一個歸宿地。船員援救的快，總算没有落水，經着衆人的種種勸慰，郭某才怏怏的回歸房中。</p>
<p>被援的郭某，深以不得其死爲憾：經那同舟者監視之中，又發現他在房中結繩自縊；又經衆人奪去繩索，郭某仍不得死；衆人防不勝防，只好束縛他的手足，免得他有第三度的覓死。</p>
<p>據郭某的申訴：本人係雲南學生，傷心東省淪亡而遠道從軍，和侵略者决一死戰：曾充義勇軍秘書。因我軍失利於敵機轟炸之下，虎口餘生，輾轉漂泊至此，在舟中傷心國難，不如一死爲快。</p>
<p>經同舟者輾轉相傳之下而引起着衆人很熱烈的同情，彼此都想量力解囊，援救這熱心愛國的漂泊青年。但是，有一女客向衆報告：曾在澳門開至香港的中興號輪船中，目擊郭某演過同樣的工作，同舟者量力援助，給以四十餘元，他才不想覓死：今天的動作，只是「依樣葫蘆」「如法泡製」罷了。經這報告之下，郭某的念秧故技，宣告失敗。　　念秧！念秧！你們行騙的方法正多，何苦要掛這救國幌子而影響於愛國青年的眞正救國工作？念秧！念秧！勸你們以後不要掛這幌子吧</p>

<p>｜悲劇在鄕村｜</p>
<p>時代的巨輪，一瞬不息地向前猛進，同時將不良的惡種子撒在大都市，以及小鄕村。我現在需要說出的，是關於附近吳興縣的鄕村中一件事實，確是做得太悽慘了！</p>
<p>話應當說在前面，這齣悲劇的主角｜實在是配角罷了。大槪總是下級人家，然有時也許會例外。我所知道的，凡是一個鄕村，在以前主宰地方的是土豪劣紳：在現在老土劣雖然形銷影匿，可是和雨後春筍一般的新土劣，却不絶地產生，同時橫行着他們的詭計。新土劣，當然也和老土劣一樣有他們的爪牙，這些爪牙，就是當地的地痞。他們平日已經是無惡不作，有錢就行之徒。現在任了新土劣爪牙之職，當然格外地獻他們的殷懃。</p>
<p>爪牙們對於在他們掌握之中的下級人家，常常留心他們有没有竹槓下手的機會。譬如××家新死了一個壯男，死者的家裏，祇有一個老母和妻子，這正是爪牙們的良機到了，也可說是新土劣的財軍臨頭！</p>
<p>在新土劣的夾袋中，有不少想娶便宜配偶的下級人物。他使喚爪牙們幾次的奔跑，這可憐新寡的孤孀，却落在一個餓虎般的懷裏。這個對方所出的便宜配偶的代價，却因孤孀的相貌妍媸而别；大槪最好二百元，最次不過一百元。</p>
<p>假使新土劣判定是二百元，那孤孀的婆婆，最多也不過到手五十元。其餘的整數却歸新土劣；零數當然是供爪牙們的揮霍。</p>
<p>這齣悲劇的命名，就是這觸目驚心的：「活切頭」三個字。！也許他處有同樣的悲劇發生，不過它的命名不同罷了！</p>

<p>— 高潛</p>
<p>！鳥類何以識路？</p>
<p>夏去了，每到秋天，便有無數鳥雀（譬如燕子）從北方飛到南方熱帶的國裏。這種遠隔重洋的飛翔，是一種最奇異的現象。因爲我們人類航海，必須有熟手駕駛，而且還要靠海洋圖，羅盤針，縱然如此周到的設備，有時還會弄錯。至於鳥類，不消說没有這許多儀器，並且在那茫茫的大海中，一點東西没的吃，居然飛越千萬里的路程，不是最奇異的事嗎？固然，有許多鳥雀，中途力竭落海而死，而其餘達到目的地的，也餓得半死，但是他們究能達到目的地，總是一件奇事。</p>
<p>鳥類何以能夠認識這樣遠的路程？生物學家還没有一定的解答。</p>
<p>大槪我們可以猜測這是老鳥敎小鳥的，倘若人問敎了那能記得，我們可以說鳥類對於這上面有極强的記憶力。</p>
<p>此外鳥類或者有一種奇怪的方向感覺，我們知道有的人不容易認路，有的人只走過一回，可以把地方記得清清楚楚或者鳥類對於這方面遠勝於人類，倘若你把鳥的眼睛蒙起來，推他轉幾轉，他也許能知道面朝何方。我們人類則蒙眼轉幾次，便不知究竟轉到那個方向了</p>

<p>潘君幼抱大志，從名師學藝，苦練十載，藝大進；及長，挈其二妹玉蘭玉榮，遠涉重洋，環遊世界各國，專以華夏武技宣傳國外，足跡所至，萬人空巷，然君未嘗以此而自滿。</p>
<p>潘君之二妹，色姿卓越，得乃兄之訓導，武藝亦大著，年前出演於歐美，以弱女而作壯夫不能爲之武術，無怪歐美人士僉爲驚嘆矣。</p>
<p>潘君非特以宣揚國技爲己任，其愛國之心，亦不後人，以外人譏吾國人爲東亞病夫者，深痛之，嘗語人曰：「國之强弱，恒視人民體格健羸爲標準，人民體格健全，則國家未有不富强者。今吾國國民素不求健身之術，羸弱已極，寢至奄奄一息，不可救藥，外侮日亟矣，吾人欲救今日之中國，當以鍛鍊體格爲急務。」　　潘君之技藝班，自國外榮歸祖國，昨方抵滬，同來者又有菊濟女士，天賦歌喉，爲美國最著名之「齊格飛歌舞團」之檯柱，吾國少女，加入該團而成爲歌星者，當以女士爲嚆矢。聞潘君等又將於下月率全班藝員離滬赴歐云。</p>

<p>李某爲山東萊州籍，曾於直魯軍任下級軍官，與漢奸金伯弓友善。金爲旗籍，現於僞國任溥儀之侍從武官，李聞之大喜，亟收拾行裝，投奔僞國，見金謀事，以爲金旣爲侍從武官，當朝夕見溥，不難得一位置；不知僞國，即號稱執政之溥儀，尙不能及一平常日人之權力，何論於金？金見李至，以已無能爲力，薦於僞實業部，部長亦李姓，魯籍，其時人民以懼日人之摧殘，不願爲其傀儡，投奔爲漢奸者甚少。見李某至，引爲同宗，與以司長之位置，李某大喜過望，以爲平步青雲，自此富貴無窮矣。未及一月，日人對僞國各部，漸露其猙獰面目，欲攫實權，實業部尤爲必得之一部，以須攫奪東北全部之鑛產實業也。復恐國際以正義相　，部長一職，不敢即行攫取，乃退而謀以各司長盡易日人，李某方興高彩烈，漠然不知，一日有日人名田中者訪李，相談甚歡，李方欲結好日人，故見日人必極盡脅肩謟笑之狀態，見田中來訪，以爲異數，極盡敷衍之能事。田中每日必至李居處，常誇言與武藤有密切關係，李益拜服，未半月，一夕，田中與李言，已奉武藤命組織便衣隊，已爲總隊長，知李熟知武事，聘爲參謀長，且不必辭去司長職務，李喜不自勝，田中贈以手槍二支，符號一紙，李受之不疑。自此以後，李自詡爲得日人之信任，越數日，田中謂李曰，「已薦與武藤，即夕偕往瀋陽相見，李絶不思索，整裝佩槍，偕田中乘車赴瀋。方至瀋站，即有日憲兵至，向李詰問，并搜李行裝，見手槍，立加手銬，謂爲義軍密探，其時田中在旁，絶無一言，揮手令憲兵押李而去。至夕，李受審於警備部，見田中方與審者作耳語，李呼救，而日兵已牽之下堂，轟然一聲，此夢想富貴之漢奸，已隨無情之槍彈，往泉台去矣！蓋皆田中之狡計，以一手槍之故，置李於死，以奪司長之位置，僞實業部長，於李去瀋之第二日，卽得日人訓令，謂司長李某，爲義軍之暗探，已正法，并派田中爲司長，僞部長見後，明知其中情弊，然絶不敢聲張也。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨天有一位鄕親朋友，特來看我，他的年紀，已有五十多歲，我因此不得不同他敷衍一番，他便滔滔不竭的從東村裏某姓家發生了一件重大盜刦案，談到西村裏表兄家的兒子，養到了二十一歲，還走不來路，又談到近日開門七件事的困難。</p>
<p>他說，我在小的時候，米價是洋拔袋的，（即兩元一石）百樣貨物，十分便宜，所以生活異常好過，如拿現在的生活來比較，大約都要漲起十倍，有的確眞不到，有的還要不止，我小時剃個頭，祇要十六文，多到二十文，現在剃頭要二三角，聽見說又有七八角或一元的，試問比較起來，要增加幾倍，所以現在的生活，眞是難過，</p>
<p>我說，你鄕下人總不要緊，有句俗語說，「城裏人窮來一滴醬，鄕下窮來鐵搭撑，」他說正爲如此，我們的鄕下人，正是毫無生路了，百樣的貨價，統統要加十倍以上，而現在的米價，反而愈弄愈糟，幾乎要弄得一錢不値，還有那個人去肯種田呢，我聽見湖南等處，已經如此，每石米祇售兩元四角，你想這樣的生命，還呌人活得下去麽，</p>
<p>我便問道，爲什麽緣故，米價如是的强，他又說道，我也不懂，不過聽見人家說，今年本來各處豐年，而各地重重徵稅，所以有米也不能流通，尤其是幾位識時務的，還要借大批美麥進來，聽說第一批已到，還有第二第三批進來，試問米價還漲得起麽，</p>
<p>我便笑對他道，你們眞是得福不知，這是你們的福氣，反使你們煩惱麽，我國的人，本來生成的福氣，一些不要做，一些不要動，樣樣會有人送給你們受用，試問一切衣服器用等物，那一件要我國人自己來動手，我們祇要拿出錢來，就無一樣東西不可辦到，即如槍砲而論，也可從他國買來，自相殘殺，我國原是以農立國，最苦的原是你們一般鄕下人，尙没有得到相當的幸福，現在有一批一批的糧食進來，你們也可以不耕而食，不織而衣這是你們的福氣，難道還知道麽，</p>
<p>鄕下人曉得對我無啥談頭，乃作别而去，我也隨筆記此即爲談言資料，</p>

<p>— 忠溶</p>
<p>一到晚來，便看見包車及自由車前的電石燈，光明可愛；然而是舶來品價錢很貴，很不値得，今將電石原料及製造的手續，寫明於下，以便國人仿製，而免利權外溢。</p>
<p>㈠原料製造電石所需的原料爲生石灰（即養化鈣又名酸化鈣）與枯煤生石灰要用新鮮不含水分的，因含水分多則發大熱而變作熟石灰了，熟石灰是不適於製造電石的原料，枯煤也要擇其純良的。將原料混合後以直接製造爲宜，若混合後置於潮濕塲所分量，就要减少，製造時宜留意。</p>
<p>㈡製法製法分爲磨碎，混合，乾燥，燒灼，凝結等工程次第述之於下。</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>甲、磨碎將選成的原料分别入於磨碎機（或以石臼代之亦可務使達到磨碎的目的爲要），研爲極細粉末後置入他器内，再用絲製細篩篩過，待其中的夾雜物（如沙石泥土等）篩盡後，即可混合。</p>
<p>乙、混合混合即將生石灰與枯煤混和，其混和量，要看原料的成分如何而區别，大約用生石灰粉二十八分，枯煤粉十八分，混合畢，用棒攪抖，至混和極匀，即行乾燥。</p>
<p>丙、乾燥取原料匀敷於白布上，晒乾，如用人工乾燥，則室溫，宜在八十度内外。</p>
<p>丁、燒灼燒灼即將乾燥的原料置於電氣爐中，漸漸燒灼，燒至白熾熱，則發出養化炭氣，如此所得的電石，尙未得良好結果，故再行凝結。</p>
<p>戊、凝結燒灼旣畢，即將電石傾出，移入放冷槽中（放冷槽以鐵製爲宜，形狀如家用普通的衣箱，槽内要光滑，且滴油少許於槽時，用乾布揩凈，以免腐敗）使其凝結，若欲製成方形，或圓形，須傾入鐵製的模型内（模型要揩凈），以待凝結，即成電石。</p>
<p>（注意）電石宜用布（或以厚紙代之亦可）包裏，置於乾燥器中，可耐經久儲藏，至使用時取出。</p>

<p>自淞口砲臺禁止參觀以來，淞滬道上，僅有憑弔戰蹟者，誠不勝滄桑之慨也！余於九日上午八時，應林周二友之約，有重弔戰蹟之行，特將沿途花絮，記之如后；</p>
<p>當火車行經天通庵站，適倭軍荷槍整隊，在北四川路底遊巡，意傲氣睨，同車目睹者，莫不憤慨眥裂；蓋車過閘北見一片焦土，有以感動也。嗚呼！民氣如斯，其奈執政者之懦弱乎？</p>
<p>未幾：余等抵砲台司令部之堤前，見樹一木牌，上書：「奉令禁止參觀砲台管理員啓」等字樣，且斷堤以阻參觀者，而令一警士司守之，可爲謹愼矣。余等乃繞至台左，皆爲鐵絲網所阻：正懊喪間，忽見軍士所穿之帆布鞋一隻，陷於路旁可一寸，不禁唏嘘再三：蓋暗忖該鞋之主人，豈其因衛土而犧牲，特留該鞋警告後人乎？然處今之日，事過境遷，罕有人跡問津矣，可不痛哉！</p>
<p>砲台灣等車站之月台，皆飽受槍彈，故台頂皆類蜂房，且水門汀柱多中折，至今尙未修葺，一派悽凉之况，固有無限之傷心也！而於車過各處，見民房之被炸者，皆成露天房子矣；蓋存其圍墻而無屋頂也。可慘！可痛！然受暴日之如斯浩刧，尙有甘爲奸商者，誠百索而不解者也。</p>

<p>— 粒火</p>
<p>㈠没有到過的地方，因之而述了方向，你可向年長者或陳舊的老店裏問訊，因他們久居該處，對於地理，當然很熟，問訊時態度須要懇切而客氣，不可驕慢無禮，不然就要受人作弄，他人用手東指西劃的瞎說，你便昏天黑地的走着，休想給你走到，</p>
<p>㈡搭電車：如有重要物件，可放在左邊裏面的衣袋裏，將左手放下壓上，右手去攀圈，態度要安閑，如有不相識的人同你攀談，你不要和他招呼，否則必致分心將東西忘記，會到他們的袋裏，</p>
<p>㈢在馬路上如有聽見槍聲，最好向附近的店裹一躱，切不可驚慌得手足無措，拚命的狂奔，巡捕當你是盜賊，便有吃流彈的危險，</p>
<p>㈣路上碰到抄靶子，須高舉着雙手聽他搜查，最忌的是手放在袋裏，你不可以爲身邊有了銀錢，趕緊伸手往袋裏揿牢，那知巡捕看見誤會當你是拿手槍，便爲有危險的事情發生，</p>
<p>㈤路上看見他人掉下的皮革啦，包裹啦，你不可貪小去拾，否則便有人作證向你敲詐，說你偷的，一看皮革裏都是紙頭，便要把你敲去十元八元，</p>
<p>㈥倘你裝滿了三輛黃包車的東西，你自己祗能坐一輛，那末其餘的二輛便不容易照顧，你可把那二輛的照會號碼抄起來，倘有意外的事情發生，便可投捕房查問，</p>
<p>㈦手裏拿了東西，不可看商店廚窗裏陳列的東西，假使你正在看得出神的時候，便是那小竊們下手的機會，</p>
<p>㈧街沿上的呌貨，你看是很便宜，但等你買了一用，便會有破壞的地方，所以無論何種便宜的東西，最好不買，方不致受騙，</p>
<p>㈨黃包車的停車處，多在小路及空曠的地方，假使你從三大公司及電影院裏出來，寗可多跑幾步，到小路裏去趁，價錢可以公道，否則便要被他們敲竹槓，</p>
<p>㈩你在晚上的十二時，從電影院或遊戲場裏回來，經過荒僻的道路，情願呌部黃包車，或走熱鬧的地方遠繞過來，因爲那時深更半夜，行人很是稀少，倘然碰到剝猪攞，便要受恐嚇了，</p>
<h3 id="c181">電車中 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>昨天當我踏上一路電車時，眞覺得僥倖，因爲我從來不曾乘過如此寛爽的電車；在長大的車廂裏，一共只有三個人，連我也在其内。因此我大膽的放鬆骨節坐在椅子上，大可以擺出坐專車的架子來。這時我很可以注意到其他二人的談話，因爲有着空閒的心情。</p>
<p>他們的談話已經繼續了很久，不過那個穿團花模本緞袍子的魁梧偉大的先生却很興奮。他對那位鼻子下面留有幾乎數得清的鬍鬚的矮漢子說：</p>
<p>「哎！我的幸福時期完全過去了喲！」</p>
<p>我聽得出這是四川人的口音。接上是對方承接着說：</p>
<p>「不過你也不必悲觀罷，也許你後來還會交着好運的。誰會知道以後的事呢？」</p>
<p>一掬承歡的笑容獻上大塊頭的眼前，然而大塊頭似乎並不理會，也許他還深入在他自己的欷歔中。不久他又說：</p>
<p>「我自十八歲一直到八年以前，從來没有脫過差事，有得吃，有得用，確是過了些好日子，可是這八年來，眞没有辦法。哎！」</p>
<p>「是的呀，所謂貴人多受難呀，哈哈哈！不過我想你老兄總積下了不少的錢吧？」</p>
<p>「錢？更不要說起。若是當時我肯賺錢的話，不消說到現在幾十萬總會有的，可是當時總遵守父親的一句話，『文官不愛錢，武官不怕死，』就是錢擺在眼面前也不肯去拿，所以到現在還是兩袖清風。」</p>
<p>「是的呀，中國的軍官若都像你一樣，那便好了。可是養老的錢總應當留下幾個的，老兄，你說對嗎？我冒昧的問一句，我想老兄現在幾萬元的積蓄總還是有的吧？」</p>
<p>「哼，不過零用的錢總還有的，不然我這八年來不做一點事，拿什麽用呢？」</p>
<p>「哦哦哦！是的是的。只要生活得過去也就可以了。」</p>
<p>「但是這幾個錢那裏夠用呢？雖然人不多，可是在上海有了大小兩個公館也就要錢開支了。」</p>
<p>當我聽到這裏的時候，我馬上連想他當年在任的威風，而今妻妾滿懷的幸福了。不過照他說這還是晦氣的時候，否則出來走走也就不致於坐電車了，至少也是奥斯汀。</p>
<p>這時我看見那一位小鬍子摸出一根橡皮頭的紙烟奉上給團花袍子，而且恭敬的爲他擦着火柴，於是這更使我感覺興趣了。其後小鬍子又說：</p>
<p>「聽說劉師長現在又要借重老兄了。」</p>
<p>「這不過是和我開玩笑罷了。你想我會去幹一個有名無實的顧問嗎？要知道做官便必須帶兵，有了軍隊便什麽都好說，没有兵權便不如不做：但是劉師長他肯放心讓我帶兵嗎？他知道他駕駛不了我，所以給我一個領乾薪的空頭銜。」</p>
<p>「可是劉師長旣然待你這樣好，我想你還是屈就一點兒吧。」</p>
<p>「這我可不幹，我做團長的時候，他也不過是一個團長，現在要我來屈就他？那眞是笑話。」</p>
<p>「錯是不錯，不過你假如去了，對兄弟却大有照顧呀，難道你老兄還不肯替兄弟謀一個小差事嗎？哈哈哈！」</p>
<p>彼此一陣不自然的大笑。</p>
<p>不幸當時我已到站，只好下去。以後不知所云。</p>
<p>我心頭覺得沉重；我想這兩個都是四川的人材，或許正因爲四川山水鍾靈，這樣的人材出得太多，所以才有今日層出不窮的流血慘劇的吧。</p>

<p>— 一塵</p>
<p>大約二月前吧，我的對窗搬來了一家人家，女主人是位頩頰多姿，摩登韶艶的女郎，她的丈夫，雖不是玉勒乘驄馬，金盤膾鯉魚，但照我的眼光看來。總有一些家私，一輛精美卓絶的奥司汀，一位如花如玉的媚夫人，早引起了我的妒嫉羨慕，只得常嘆他們幸福吧了！</p>
<p>不過，我這樣的注意着，因爲他們的行跡好像有點神秘，是呀！夜半頭兩點鐘回來，下午三四點鐘出去，難道不會使人起疑惑嗎？</p>
<p>天空掛着一個半圓的皎月，疏星綴天，一霎霎的在舞着，除了遠處的狗吠聲，再也聽不到一些兒聲息，一個柔和美麗的夜，但事的發生，也在這夜，就是這柔和美麗的一夜。</p>
<p>平時的我，那一天不是一𥈝睡到大�</p>
<p>天亮，今天確不然了，翻來覆去，再也睡不着，突然一聲喇叭，衝破了幽靜，震動了我的耳膜，「是！本來睡不着，不如起來看看那位美人兒吧!」還没這樣地想完，身子早不由主的踱到窗口去了！</p>
<p>雖然，有時曾見到他們倆的回來，但今天多了一位西裝少年，不！也許常來的，因爲這幾天晚上我從未起來一窺，所以這次更生疑了，伏在窗檻上看他們開門，關門，上客堂，上樓，······</p>
<p>不幸得很，粉紅的窗簾，阻止了我的眼綫，但耳福總不能當住，歡笑，歌聲，談話，不斷地波浪，略微的傳了過來，我這樣的呆望着，從窗簾後面映出來的人影，時辰鐘叮！叮！叮！叮！已報了四下！</p>
<p>呀！不對，半個鐘頭後，他們的行跡有些不對了·爲什麽黑的人影來來去去的這樣忙？吓！那個影子手中拿的不是刀麽？唉！他什麽倒啊！······接着一片碗几凳子翻倒的聲音·</p>
<p>「嗚···」那個穿西裝和那位女郎挾了一包東西急急忙忙地闖下樓來，開了汽車去了！</p>
<p>戰慄，膽怯，害怕，一層層的熱血擁上了心頭·「睡魔」早飛到九霄雲外，不一會，天微熹的亮了，嘈雜的聲音已充滿了一弄堂·</p>
<p>「不得了！少······爺死···死啦！奶奶呀！什······什麽地方去的！······」「我我去報告去！」「巡捕來了？······吓！三大頭也來了！」「血泊中的一個······！刀······？」</p>
<p>對窗的我，抖得更利害了，幾乎膝蓋和地板摩擦了！「醋！色！財！」腦中不住的循擾着。</p>

<h3 id="c184">蘇聯電影公司的組織 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>蘇聯電影公司創立於一九二五年，簡稱爲梭夫基諾（Cobknbo），除了專有製作蘇聯電影之權力以外，並有蘇聯國内的電影輸出輸入之特權。</p>
<p>蘇聯電影公司的股東便是該公司的設立者·亦就是人民敎育委員會，工業經濟評議會，莫斯科蘇維埃，列寗格勒蘇維埃，商業委員會等。該公司以十一人組織一管理委員會，主席爲共產黨的中央委員會的秘書。</p>
<p>由股東大會選舉五人組織監督委員會，一爲莫斯科攝影塲監督，一爲列寗格勒攝影塲監督，一爲興行部之監督，一爲技術部之監督。</p>
<p>梭夫基諾在一九三零年度的電影製作中投資了五百萬盧布，其内容分配如次：藝術片四十本，新聞片三十本，敎育晋及及其他雜片五十本。</p>
<p>在莫斯科和列寗格勒的二攝影塲中，使用着四十五人的導演，主要的有埃曾修登，羅姆，克列修夫，塔利特，瓦哈託夫，波波夫，託拉烏伯克等人。</p>
<p>關於該公司的内部設備也很完全，有爲試騐而用的研究所，有容納三百四十人的演員俱樂部，有收容二百人的小食堂，有容納一千二百人的大食堂，有兩個圖書館（一爲一般的，一爲個人用的），有容納百人的身體訓練所，有浴堂，攝影塲，倉庫，有容納五百人的旅館，而且可以立刻變爲劇塲，此外如病室，療養室，共產黨員少年先鋒集會的會塲等，都很完備的建築着。因爲蘇聯電影事業，是由國家經營的緣故，所以電影公司的社會主義化，乃是必然的趨勢了。</p>

<p>ＬionalＢarrymore是一位年老德高資望重的大明星。他和嘉寳合演的奈何天ＭataHeri，及和伊麗莎蘭娣合演的黃執照，ＹellowＴicket的確是呌人欽佩的。不久來華的「大飯店」中，他也是七個大主角之一。在攝製這片時，小范朋克夫人（瓊克勞馥）竟因爲他的持重和忠懇，使她臨時會「上塲昏」。巴利穆亞的力量，</p>

<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>狩獵片，在近一年來是受盡了人的歡迎和贊許；所以應時產生的量數，也很可觀了。今天在新光映的Ｈell，sＨeadquarters，又是以狩獵相號召的一片。</p>
<p>環球公司，對於這種片子，攝製最力，這一張在實際上，都並不能算環球野獸片的鉅作！</p>
<p>演員遠不錯：傑克牟哈爾ＪＭulhall，雖然是不夠驕健，但是也很稱職，女主角柏勃拉魏克絲ＢarbaraＷeeks，是有很好的表演；在野獸羣中攝片的女明星，是很難有如此的，佛蘭克梅郁ＦrankＭayo，很可取；特别是被獅子。大嚼的一幕。</p>
<p>導演在鏡頭的攝法和地位上，很高明，取景也很好；當然這片子，只有極少的是内景，外景的偉麗，是很給片子生色的。</p>
<p>情節很曲折，可惜前一半很可以表情的地方，却省去了許多鏡頭，用對白來述明；未免會呌英文淺些的人，不十分明瞭，不過發音却很清晰。</p>
<p>還有，野獸的幾幕，雖很精彩，但是太少了；呌看片的人，不能得到希望中的巨大恐怖和刺激！</p>
<p>牠也很明顯的述說：白人對於黑奴，待遇不平等，非人道。還告訴我們，以力服人，以德服人，的收效。</p>
<p>0平均的比較說法：這片子不及人獸奇觀和泰山人猿，但是比菲洲小人國和冰國大觀，好得多了，他完全是愛情劇，而穿挿了很少菲洲剛果的風土野獸，作成了結局的關鍵，而那始終没看見的大批象牙，却是　劇的中心。他的長處在此；短處也在此，</p>

<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>在攝地獄大本營中一幕野景的時候，ＢabaraＷeeks被一隻激怒的豹，擊傷了。</p>
<p>這不幸的遭遇，是在ＢabaraＷeeks與一隻敎馴的豹，剛剛拍完一幕之後：但當她演完走過這隻豹前的時候，這無理的野獸，忽然躍起，張開着利爪，直向ＢabaraＷeeks撲過來：經過ＪackＭulhall的奮鬥，總算把凶猛的怒豹驅掉。但是十三條血影的爪痕，已深深地刻在ＢabaraＷeesk的美麗的粉腿上了！</p>
<p>後來，ＢabaraＷeeks經過數日在醫院裏休養，才繼續和這只撲傷她的豹，攝完最後最精彩的幾幕！</p>
<p>意見一般</p>
<h3 id="c188">國產影片中吻的問題 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 毁尊</p>
<p>我們看外國影片和國產影片，最使我們覺感不滿足的，莫過於吻的表現了。在外國影片中，我們常常看到四片熱烈烈地唇在緊緊的黏着，而國產影片中，幾乎没有看過這樣的接吻，至多不過用種種方法表示一個吻而已。</p>
<p>在愛情最濃烈的時候，或者是情慾極緊張的時候，除掉熱烈在狂吻之外，在銀幕上，我敢說，没有其他的方法能有盡情的表現。我們想想吧，當我們看見外國影片中深深地一吻後，我們的心弦是怎樣的緊張！及至我們看到國產影片中在要接吻的時候，忽然變了佈景，或者用背影表示出來，我們是感到多麽的不滿足和煞風景啊！</p>
<p>這裏，吻的問題，對於男明星們或者没有什麽，而問題是在女明星身上了。或者，中西的習慣不同，在外國，吻是普遍的一件事，所以在銀幕上表演接吻，也就輕而易舉。而中國呢，吻是背在人後，給情人的專利品，所以，在銀幕上的假情人，女明星的香唇，就不肯奉贈了。</p>
<p>其實，電影是一種偉大的藝術，藝術的至要條件，是反映人生。人生中，誰有不和其情人接吻者？人生旣如此，則銀幕上的情人，也應黨痛痛快快地一吻，不管他們在事實上是眞的情人或竟是不相干。</p>
<p>所以，女明星應爲偉大的藝術而犧牲，爲藝術而犧牲一吻，總比在人背後送給情人的一吻，要有價値得多了。</p>
<p>所以，不演熱愛的片子則已，如要演熱情的片子，就應當表演這！！</p>

<p>我於一九零六年十月六日、生在　　特　菲城、我的父親在我的幼年就過世了、我的後父呌瓊司、是一位電機師、他從我小時就希望我從事電影工作。所以我的踏進電影界、完全是受他的鼓勵和誘掖的。</p>
<p>在我出了學校之後、我便决定找事情做。在一個清晨、我同一位朋友去找職業。很幸運地我便在一所鞋店辦事、每週的薪水十八元。但不久即失業。于是又回到學校裏去。那時候我的家庭便由舊金山遷到落杉磯。這時我就得到很大的刺激、因爲我在那龐大的汽車裏、看見了幾個大明星、羡慕得了不得。</p>
<p>我最初踏進攝景場是在一個聖誕之夜、那時我充着臨時演員。但我是非常地起勁、並覺得生活也不似在學校裏那樣單調了。此後又進了ＰovertyRow製片公司、担任稍爲重要的演員。在這許多平凡的影片上、我郤得到了很有價値的經騐。</p>
<p>有一天、福克司公司招考女演員。我便去報名。不幸、這導演選定了一位很有經騐的。也許那導演是不錯的、但這在那時候實使我受了一個極大的打擊。</p>
<p>正是我在ＨalRoach公司的時候、我接到了環球公司戴丁（ＦredＤating）的電話、呌我去扮演一重要的主角。此片成功之後、我便由臨時演員而和公司訂上了合同。（未完）</p>

<p>一部影片，在同一區域並映於兩家以上的戲院。報紙上面，登着「幾大戲院同時開映」的鉅幅廣告。藉此張大聲勢，號召觀衆。這是電影業中近來很流行的一個比較進步的營業方法。不過，事實上要希望收獲良好的效果，確還非得憑恃影片内容的優美不可。</p>
<p>明星公司的連集長片「啼笑因緣」。現在正是一集二集三集四集的忙着「幾大戲院同時開映。」不僅上海，一埠如此。而且京漢平津等處的各影戲院，也是一般情狀。一時這樣的求過於供，於是，縱有許多拷貝，依舊還是不敷分配。因此，凡於一地數院並映時，他們便想出方法，把一個拷貝，同時供給幾家戲院的應用。事前，算定鐘點。首由甲院准時放映。但等一本映完，隨即派定專員，送交乙院丙院。</p>
<p>在此各地競映「啼笑因緣」之際。關於漢口方面，這幾天他們正在利用航郵飛機，往來寄運。據說，航空運片，滬漢單程運費，每磅例價爲二元九角。影片每部重量，約在六十磅以上。遞寄一次核計共須洋二百餘元。雖則爲數不小，　　但是縮地有方，來去却利便極了。國片營業，用飛機來運輸的。這部「啼笑因緣」，還是破題兒第一遭。將來在電影史上，倒是一個小掌故呢。</p>

<p>這幾天：在上海各影院映的片子，佳構很多，昨天記者，偶然到了兩家，所謂二等影戲院看看：不意所得到的補償，有出乎我初料之外的：我看見一般觀衆，丨連我也在内，都能受到極大的感觸。這也可以證明這兩張片子，的確有動人之處了；</p>
<p>第一是北京開映的「歌塲魅影。」這片本是郎却乃十年前的舊作，而最近配音的。但是當那魅影出現時，全場就發出一種自然的恐怖空氣。有不少人都和片中女角，同時喊出「哎呀」的一聲來。因爲是夜塲，竟有許多膽小的人，（女子居多）紛紛離座走了。您說奇怪不奇怪？</p>
<p>第二是中央開映的「蘭谷萍踪」。當然到中央大戲院去的，以老（？）派人居多，摩登男女不大光臨的。所以「蘭谷萍踪」第一次在新光開映時，塲中不乏喁喁情談，而昨天中央却是愁雲慘霧，處處聽得到嚶嚶啜泣之聲。這種聲音，自然不是有聲片中的啊。直到出塲時，還有許多人遮了眼睛走。如果你細看，十位中有七八位，是紅紅的淚痕在目！</p>

<h3 id="c193">表情的原動力 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>練習過一兩次集中意志之後，你就覺得在練習的時候，你的呼吸受到一種非常的壓迫。集中的程度越高，你的呼吸越容易自己覺到。從來没有練過各種呼吸運動的人往往要感到氣促，甚至於喘不過氣來。</p>
<p>這是練習表情必然的結果。演銀幕劇與演舞台劇一樣，一點鐘的工作，所耗費的精力往往要比他種勞心或勞力的工作，加上好幾倍。就因爲演到緊張的情緒千變萬化的時候，我們耗費的氣力太多，所以我們過後極容易，感到疲倦。大凡在攝影塲上拍過一兩個有表情的鏡頭的人都嘗試過這種異常疲憊的滋味吧。體格不健全或是呼吸器官有問題的人與攝影機無緣，就因爲這個緣故。</p>
<p>是的。情緒的變幻是必須有深呼吸的帮助的。從前有人問過我，表情的原動力是甚麽。我說呼吸就是表情的原動力。無論你要做甚麽表情，必須先把呼吸機關調節到恰恰合乎那種情緒所需要的，方能表現得恰到好處。否則，無論你做那一種表情，都不能夠做得像眞的一模一樣的。我們看見許多國產影片裏的表情做得非常的幼稚可笑，就因爲由金錢，奥援，親戚，變愛，以及其他種種不正當的手叚，奪得明星地位的人從來没有知道表情的總機關或是原動力就在乎呼吸的緣故。換一句話說，許多看慣了舶來片的朋友們所以不喜歡看國產片的緣故就因爲現在有許多明星還没有知道這一種表情的「秘訣」</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Sharp Increase in Unfavorable Trade Balance and the Active Financial Power of Foreigners in China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In our country in recent years, international trade has seen a daily decline in exports and a relentless increase in imports. The amount of the unfavorable trade balance has increased sharply. In 1929, it was only 250 million taels of customs silver. In 1930, it increased to 414 million taels. In 1931, it further increased to 525 million taels. As for this year, up to September, it has reached a huge sum of 446 million taels. It is estimated that the unfavorable trade balance for the entire year will be more than 600 million taels. At the same time, the remittances from overseas Chinese, which used to be relied upon to offset the unfavorable trade balance and regulate the international balance of payments, have been decreasing year by year due to the world panic and the restrictions on the entry of overseas Chinese in various places. Under this double blow of a sharp increase in the unfavorable trade balance on one hand and a decrease in remittances on the other hand, what can we rely on to cope with international debts?</p>
<p>Because of the existence of foreign financial power and because foreign financial organizations in China are completely free from the supervision and inspection of our government, the study of the settlement of China's international balance of payments has become an extremely complex issue. However, when we study this complex issue, it is undoubtedly impossible to ignore the status of foreign financial businesses in China. The foreign financial power in China that can be used for our research is the reserves of various foreign banks in this port.</p>
<p>In November of last year, the reserves of various foreign banks in this port were 34 million taels of silver and 23 million yuan of silver. As of today, the reserves of silver have reached 96 million taels and the reserves of silver yuan have reached 35 million yuan. In one year, the reserves of silver have increased by a huge amount of 62 million taels and the reserves of silver yuan have increased by 2 million yuan. Part of the reserves of banks is for the preparation of issuance and operation, and the other part is floating capital, that is, funds that can be lent but have not found a suitable lending channel for the time being. The amount of preparation often does not change dramatically, while the amount of floating capital changes very sharply because it is not controlled by the bank itself. There is no doubt that most of the huge increase in reserves of foreign banks in the past year belongs to floating capital.</p>
<p>The source of this huge amount of floating capital that has increased in the vaults of foreign banks comes from two sources. First, the deposits withdrawn from Chinese banks and transferred to foreign banks. Second, the cash flowing into the hands of foreigners as a result of the unfavorable trade balance. However, in the past year, not only the reserves of foreign banks have increased sharply, but also the cash reserves of Chinese banks have increased rapidly. This is enough to prove that the amount of funds transferred from Chinese banks to foreign banks is not worthy of attention. The floating capital increased in the vaults of foreign banks in the past year is almost entirely the cash flowing into the hands of foreigners as a result of the unfavorable trade balance. The people in the interior purchase imported foreign goods, and the money flows from the hands of merchants to Shanghai. However, because no one cares about the export of local goods, the money flowing into Shanghai has no way to flow back to the interior. At the same time, the gold used to pay international debts has been exported over the years and almost completely plundered. This cash flowing into Shanghai cannot be exchanged for gold to be transported away, so it stays there and becomes a deposit of foreigners in foreign banks.</p>
<p>Because of the abundance of floating capital, foreign banks have to find ways to use it urgently. As a result, a few months ago, there was a loan from HSBC to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Recently, a foreign banking group has underwritten the municipal government's Reconstruction Public Bonds. The widely publicized China General Omnibus Company's pledge of the four warehouses of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is also an action of foreign banks with abundant floating capital seeking a way out.</p>
<p>We can summarize the above arrangement to know that the current compensation for part of the unfavorable trade balance is actually through the following methods: unfavorable trade balance → floating capital owned by foreign banks → foreign investment and claims in China</p>
<p>If the people of the country are not forgetful, they may still remember the purchase of the Shanghai Municipal Council Electricity Department of the Shanghai International Settlement by American merchants the year before last. The purchase price reached a huge amount of 80 million taels. In addition, the expansion of Japanese yarn factories in this port and the establishment of various foreign-run industries in recent years are all ways to compensate for the unfavorable trade balance.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to pay attention to the fact that, as mentioned above, the so-called floating capital is only a part of the funds that can be lent but cannot be lent for the time being. In other words, in addition to floating capital, there are still a large number of funds that have been properly lent. According to common sense, the funds that have been lent must be much larger than the amount of floating capital. Therefore, although the amount of floating capital increased in the vaults of foreign banks in one year is only more than 60 million taels, the amount of cash flowing into foreign banks must be several times this amount.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is only to point out the cause and effect of the current active financial power of foreigners in China. First, to show that the compensation for the unfavorable trade balance has a considerable substantive price, and there is no unexpected bargain. Our country's current trade situation is like a declining family. As a result of years of deficit, we even have to borrow money to purchase daily necessities. Second, to show that foreign investment has its inevitable background and reasons, and it is by no means to please anyone. Their loans to us are certainly not out of love for us, and they also have their own unavoidable difficulties. Therefore, those who bear the brunt can adhere to their own positions and obtain appropriate conditions. If they seek completeness with humiliation, or pretend to be arrogant, they will only be laughed at by foreigners. If the four warehouses of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are mortgaged, paying very high interest rates and giving extremely large rebates, and even losing their management rights, their ignorance is truly undeniable. Whether there are other circumstances, there is no need to discuss them. As for the advantages and disadvantages of using foreign capital, it is not within the scope of this article.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The League of Nations Meeting Today: The Sino-Japanese Issue Will First Be Approached in Private; Matsuoka Exchanged Views with the US Representative Yesterday; Formal Discussion May Be Delayed Until Wednesday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 20th: The League of Nations Administrative Council will not discuss the Lytton Report on Monday, but will probably delay the discussion until Wednesday. A private meeting will be held on Monday to handle ordinary issues, and there may not be a public meeting. Negotiators are now trying to find a moderate path to facilitate the progress of the discussion. At each meeting of the Administrative Council, the Secretariat prepares the agenda in advance, but this time the Secretariat also feels difficult to start. The summary of Japan's opinion on the Lytton Report will be published in London, Washington, and Tokyo today. The Japanese representative Matsuoka met with the US representative Davis yesterday for an hour and a half. The President of the Administrative Council, Valera, was also present.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Geneva, 20th: As a result of the contact between the President of the League of Nations Council, Valera, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, and the Japanese Plenipotentiary Matsuoka, the Provisional Council decided to meet at 11:00 am on the 21st (6:00 pm Shanghai time). The first ten to twenty minutes of the meeting will not be open to the public due to the determination of the agenda and other procedures. After that, it will be open to the public. President Valera will announce the discussion of the Sino-Japanese issue, and then Representative Matsuoka will deliver a speech.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 20th: The agenda of the Administrative Council meeting to be held tomorrow includes the application of the Chinese government, the consideration of the Lytton Report, and the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay. This matter has been entrusted to a three-country committee for consideration.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 20th: The Japanese delegation to the League of Nations confirmed that it will submit a proposal on naval disarmament to the presidium of the Disarmament Conference. The Japanese delegation has to review the Manchurian issue and publish its formal opinion on the Lytton Report, so the submission of the proposal on disarmament will inevitably be delayed. It is said that this proposal will be published within this week.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Washington, 19th: US officials heard that Japan will cite the US acquisition of the Panama Canal concession in the League of Nations as a defense for its military actions in Manchuria. Today, they rose up to strongly refute this, saying that the two are completely different. First, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact were both concluded and signed after the Panama Canal area was ceded to the United States, and the United States' current Far East policy is based on these two treaties.</p>
<p>Second, the two rarely have anything in common. Panama had betrayed Colombia for many years, and on November 3, 1903, it declared its independence. Ten days later, it was recognized by the United States. Two days later, the United States and Panama signed a treaty in which the United States paid 25 million yuan to purchase the right to dig the canal. When the old treaty expired in 1924, a new treaty was renewed in 1926, which more clearly stipulated the rights of the two countries. The United States agreed not to engage in any enterprises in the canal area that would compete with the industries of the Republic of Panama, and the Republic of Panama agreed that if the United States was at war with other countries, it would also consider itself to be at war.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 20th: The Observer commented on the League of Nations Administrative Council's handling of the Lytton Report tomorrow, saying that judging from the remarks of the Japanese representative Matsuoka, it is clear that the difficulty lies in the correct nature of the autonomy that can be had in the three eastern provinces. Matsuoka used the term "local autonomy" when informally stating Japan's demands. Although the views to be expressed in Geneva will not be exactly the same as those of Lytton and Matsuoka, it is expected that there will be no reason for the views to be very different.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 20th: The Times today recorded the various issues that will be discussed in Geneva, saying that the world is now on the edge of a knife. Japan threatens the League of Nations that if the League of Nations agrees with the Lytton Report, it will withdraw from the League of Nations. The League of Nations must now deal with it properly, and the Disarmament Conference has still not made any decisions. Steded, a former Times reporter and famous political writer, said that if Japan withdraws from the Administrative Council, the Administrative Council and the Special Conference of the League of Nations must consider whether the resolution unanimously passed by the Special Conference on March 11 this year should be maintained by other member states together with the United States, and used as a tool, and to what extent it should be maintained. It is necessary to include the United States because the Kellogg-Briand Pact will be invoked. He also said that whether Japan withdraws from the League of Nations or not, its rejection of the Lytton Report can create an extremely serious situation. The success or failure of the Disarmament Conference may depend on the League of Nations' determination to maintain the Lytton Report. According to the resolution of March 11, which was the second result, it showed the victory of the liberals in the League of Nations General Assembly. The resolution specially stated that after discussing the entire case, the League of Nations General Assembly decided that any resolution made under military pressure violated the League of Nations Covenant, and any situation or treaty established by methods that violated the League of Nations Covenant or the Paris Pact for the Renunciation of War could not be considered valid.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Geneva Administrative Council meeting may end at 6:00 pm on the 21st. It is expected that the telegrams of the day can arrive in China after 7.5 hours, which must be late at night. The personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will work overnight on the 21st. According to the speculation of its diplomats, the League of Nations will not have any significant results on the Sino-Japanese issue at present. The non-recognition of Manchukuo is an unbreakable proposition of the powers. The results of the Administrative Council may issue a statement in the near future that Manchukuo cannot exist in law. Regarding the saying that the International Committee will discuss the Chinese issue, various Chinese newspapers frequently record whether to accept it or not, and Japanese newspapers also have words of opposition. According to the important British and American figures who came to Beijing, they said that the League of Nations did not express its intention to form this committee. The Chinese and Japanese parties did not know what basis they were saying this on. When asked about our diplomatic figures, they also said that the term "International Committee" was first revealed by the Mainichi Shimbun, but the Chinese government did not propose that the Sino-Japanese issue be handled by the International Committee.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee notified all members in Shanghai that they will gather in Nanjing from the 21st, and meetings will be held once every afternoon, and at any time if necessary. All telegrams will be concentrated in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for translation and rapid transmission. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council will submit for discussion on the 23rd the case of Japan's sophistry and unreasonable arguments against the report. The Foreign Affairs Committee advocated strict rebuttal and did not submit an opinion to the League of Nations, because our country believes that no matter whether there are any errors in the Lytton Report's observations or suggestions, it is a legitimate document for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Song Ziwen is scheduled to return to Beijing from Shanghai by plane on the 21st with his secretary to participate in the Foreign Affairs Committee. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations will meet tomorrow (the 21st), and the trend is difficult to determine. According to the observation of various experts, there are roughly three trends: ㈠ To convene a meeting based on the Nine-Power Treaty and make the United States the leader, but this matter is difficult to achieve. ㈡ The League insists on direct negotiations between China and Japan, but does not clearly stipulate the basic points of discussion. ㈢ No matter how hard the representatives of China and Japan work, the League only declares that it does not recognize Manchukuo, expresses its spirit and avoids practical measures, and allows the current situation in Northeast China to extend. Moreover, the opinions of various commissioners are that now everything depends on our country's resolute and unwavering adoption of positive methods to increase economic resistance and prepare for military confrontation. In diplomacy, we should befriend Soviet Russia. (Central News Agency telegram on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The secretary of the British Charge d'Affaires Yinggelan, Miles, said that Mr. Ying came to Beijing this time because the League of Nations meeting was approaching, so he contacted and consulted with the diplomatic authorities of your country at any time. He will return to Beijing about two weeks later. Lamberson will start his journey to China and return to his post within next month. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The League of Nations Administrative Council meeting will open tomorrow. The ministers of various countries have gone to Beijing because they are in contact with our diplomatic authorities at any time. The US Minister Johnson is scheduled to go to Beijing tomorrow night, and the German Minister Todtmann will go south within the next few days. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japan's Barbaric Policy <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely not allowed to abolish the puppet organization</p>
<p>Oppose the establishment of an international committee</p>
<p>If the League of Nations does not recognize it, then withdraw</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: Foreign Minister Uchida and Representative Matsuoka will adopt a suitable and proper approach with broad and free discretionary power at the League of Nations. The fundamental policy for dealing with the Manchurian issue is as follows, and this has been telegraphed to Representative Matsuoka:</p>
<p>1.  The independence of "Manchukuo" and the empire's recognition of that country are solemn and established facts, and absolutely cannot be cancelled or made ambiguous.</p>
<p>2.  It seems more appropriate for the League of Nations to observe the development of "Manchukuo" silently. If the method of silent observation is to restrain Japan or hinder the development of "Manchukuo," it will be resolutely rejected.</p>
<p>3.  If China and Japan are advised to negotiate directly, it should be with the representatives of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." Direct negotiations must absolutely exclude the participation of third countries and absolutely oppose the establishment of an international committee to assist in the negotiations.</p>
<p>4.  If the League of Nations makes a resolution not to recognize "Manchukuo" or even a joint statement, Japan will resolutely oppose it even if it withdraws from the League of Nations.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Talk by Foreign Minister Uchida <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: The League of Nations Council will discuss the Manchurian issue, centered on the Lytton Report, in front of world public opinion. Therefore, it will be discussed in Geneva from the 21st. Japan will stand at the forefront with Chief Representative Matsuoka and others, and express the empire's beliefs in order to enlighten the countries. Today, Foreign Minister Uchida issued the following statement:</p>
<p>The empire's actions have always been fair and have nothing to be ashamed of. Even at the League of Nations meeting, it will act in a dignified manner, so there is no need for false schemes. It is difficult to predict what the situation will be. If the facts on the ground in Manchuria are earnestly explained, it is deeply believed that the League of Nations will also recognize Japan's claims. The so-called countermeasures of the League of Nations are to proceed with respect for the status quo in Manchuria. Therefore, Mr. Matsuoka was specially appointed as the representative because he is familiar with Japanese public opinion, the actual situation of "Manchukuo," and the Manchurian issue. Now, I trust the efforts of the same person, and this time I will break the evils of so-called "instruction diplomacy" and give the delegation broad discretionary powers, and I expect its active role. Even on the Manchurian issue, I only hope that the League of Nations will recognize the firmly established facts of Japan's recognition, and not ask the League of Nations to immediately recognize "Manchukuo," so there is no danger of a head-on collision with the League of Nations. If the League of Nations carefully reviews Japan's opinion, I am confident that the meeting will proceed smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Statement by the Japanese Ministry of the Army <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: Before the League of Nations Council meeting, the Army authorities today clarified their attitude to China and foreign countries in the form of a statement as follows:</p>
<p>We are paying close attention to how the League of Nations will respond to the Lytton Report, the opinion of the Imperial Government, the solemn existence of "Manchukuo," and the way in which the Empire recognizes "Manchukuo." Our determination has long been decided, and there is no need to say more now. Even if there is a head-on collision with the League of Nations, it is unavoidable, and we will only dare to move forward in what we believe. Our opinion can be said to complete the Lytton Report. The Manchurian issue can be resolved by Japan and Manchukuo, and it remains a residual problem for China and other countries to recognize it in the League of Nations. Empty talk on paper has repeatedly led to disputes and has misled the mission of the League of Nations itself. The Lytton Report considers restoring Manchuria to the state before the September 18th Incident to be unsatisfactory, but restoring it to the state before Japan recognized it is also impossible. However, the best way to solve the problem is for the countries to recognize the established fact of the existence of "Manchukuo." It is regrettable that the countries are engaged in legal arguments that ignore justice and are biased against Japan, and I hope they will not go astray, so as to lead the League of Nations to a dangerous situation. I am confident that our aspirations will be realized at this council meeting. (The Japanese government's opinion is published later)</p>

<p>(Beiping) People from Rehe talked about the fact that there were more than a thousand Japanese troops in Tongliao. Now there is a division of troops being reinforced. Japanese planes have been transporting bombs and military supplies for days, and they are very busy. On the 11th, five Japanese planes bombed Kailu County, dropping six bombs, which landed outside the South Gate, injuring two soldiers, killing one civilian, and killing five livestock. More than ten bombs were dropped at Daotaiyingzi on the front line, injuring one soldier and more than thirty horses. The bomb crater was six feet deep. Liu Jianren, the detachment leader of a certain guerrilla unit, and Bao Kegang are still contacting Hu Baoshan's unit in Kangping and Zhanyu, waiting for an opportunity to move against Changtu, threatening the right side of the enemy army. The leader of the guard, Bi Kezong, encouraged the guerrillas to work hard to resist Japan. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhanhai telegraphed Beiping on the 19th, stating that the commander of our 23rd Brigade, Li Ziyang, led his troops from Shanghewan towards Dehui County on the 1st. The enemy retreated into the city. Li's brigade is currently besieging the city.

<h3 id="e15">Japanese Side Changes Plan to Eliminate the Righteous Army <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Utilizing Traitors, Buying Off Youth</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from the Liaojihei People's Support Association, the Japanese originally planned to first occupy Rehe in order to cut off the righteous army's supply route in eastern provinces, hoping that they would be eliminated naturally. At the same time, they would disrupt Tianjin, Shanghai, and dissolve organizations that supported the righteous army in order to fundamentally eliminate the Northeast righteous army. This plan has now been changed due to various factual reasons. The reasons are as follows: 1. The righteous army in the eastern provinces now occupies considerable territory. Even if Rehe is occupied and the rear is cut off, the righteous armies in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and eastern Liaoning cannot be eliminated naturally. In this case, the war zone would be expanded without any real effect. Therefore, a new plan of gradual elimination has been adopted. Currently, their main force has begun to eliminate the righteous army in the eastern border region, namely the triangular area within the Shenhai Road, the Yalu River, and the Anfeng Road. 2. The two incidents in Tianjin and Shanghai previously only wasted money and increased international ill will without any practical benefit. Furthermore, they were constrained by budgetary and economic limitations. Therefore, they have changed to hiring Chinese traitors to conduct reconnaissance of the Chinese interior, distributing them in various locations to act opportunistically. They are also using more southerners, taking advantage of their active minds. 3. The puppet government's military authorities have recently dispatched a large number of spies and assassination squads to sneak into Tianjin, Beiping, Nanjing, and Wuhan to secretly investigate the military and political situation in our country. These personnel are all buying off young Chinese students, using pretexts such as applying for schools, seeking education, enlisting in the righteous army, or seeking positions in various organizations. They departed at the beginning of this month and entered our mainland via Dalian to work. (20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Internal Affairs Conference has stipulated the discussion of seven major issues: 1. Local autonomy; 2. Promoting water conservancy construction; 3. Promoting land administration; 4. County government organization; 5. Reforming the security corps; 6. Food management; 7. Improving police administration. An internal order has been sent to various provinces and regions to collect relevant materials to serve as the basis for discussion at the conference. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Internal Affairs Conference has received more than 30 proposals, with those concerning local autonomy and self-defense organizations being the most numerous. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central News Agency reporter interviewed Kong Lihang, Secretary-General of the Internal Affairs Conference, on the 20th to inquire about the preparations. According to him, the internal affairs department felt that there was still a lack of close communication between the central government and the provinces and cities, and obstacles often occurred in the implementation of policies. Furthermore, although many of the various laws and regulations stipulated by the central government have achieved remarkable results since their implementation, they have not been universally implemented. The reason for this is either poor execution or because the laws and regulations do not meet practical requirements. Therefore, it is planned to convene a conference to seek remedies. The current conference differs slightly from past internal affairs conferences in that: 1. Past internal affairs conferences placed too much emphasis on theory. This conference will focus on centralizing proposals and expecting practical solutions. 2. The number of representatives at this conference has increased compared to the past. The civil affairs commissioners of each province, the public security bureau chiefs of the provincial capitals, the bureau chiefs of the cities directly under the Executive Yuan, and the autonomy commissioners of each province are all allowed to attend, and experts are invited to contribute their opinions in order to gather ideas and achieve ideal results. It is estimated that there are five major proposals to be discussed: 1. Administrative reforms should enable provinces, counties, and cities to perform their respective functions. 2. Local autonomy should also be discussed thoroughly. 3. It seems appropriate to adopt a conscription system for the civil corps and should also be discussed. 4. Land issues, such as how to redistribute land in recovered bandit areas so that both farmers and landlords benefit. 5. Implementing an experimental district system, that is, designating one or several counties in a province as an experimental district to increase the district's powers and capabilities, try out new policies, observe the results, and then extend them to others. The conference preparations are now in place. Many proposals have been submitted by the provinces. The review procedure is complicated, so the workload has been extremely heavy recently.

<p>Income Does Not Cover Expenditures, Resulting in Monthly Deficits</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the national crisis, in addition to the 20 million yuan in accumulated arrears from last year, after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, customs tax revenue decreased sharply. Second Vice Minister of Finance Song promised to raise 10 million yuan per month. According to the budget reduction plan of the financial conference, this was reduced by 8 million yuan. Out of desperation, they had to spend future income, barely managing to cope. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin repeatedly requested an increase, even threatening to resign in protest. As a result, Song agreed to allocate 13 million yuan per month for military expenses starting in May. Because the national tax from Shandong had not been returned to the central government, after deducting 700,000 yuan for Shandong military expenses, the actual monthly allocation was only 12.3 million yuan. Starting in July, bandit suppression expenses were increased by 1.5 million yuan. Furthermore, in October, income did not cover expenditures, reaching a deficit of more than 2 million yuan. After months of accumulated deficits, it will certainly be impossible to make up the shortfall. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 19th. The U.S. government today published the third volume of "World War," containing documents exchanged between the U.S. and Russia during the final stages of World War I, most of which have not been previously released. These include documents of U.S. negotiations with China to dare to sell and prohibit goods from Manchuria from entering Siberia, as well as protests to Japan regarding the placement of the Siberian Railway under military administration when troops were sent to Siberia.</p>
<p>In addition, it also released documents of the joint protests of the U.S., Britain, and France to Soviet Russia in 1918 regarding the cancellation of foreign debt. The documents stated that the Russian government's order to cancel foreign debt was of no value, and the three countries reserved the right to demand compensation from Russia for losses incurred as a result.</p>

<p>"Soviet Russian Scientists, Writers, Professors, Journalists, and One Woman Experience 65 Days in the Arctic Freeze and Successfully Explore the Northeast Passage of Eurasia, Covering 60,000 Miles" ▲Tokyo, 19th. The Soviet icebreaker "Sibiryakov," which experienced an expedition of 20,000 miles in the Arctic freeze, arrived from the White Coast in northern Europe to the Far East and has now departed from Yokohama to return to Vladivostok. The expedition team rested in Tokyo for two weeks, and the expedition leader, Dr. Schmidt, gave several lectures to Japanese scientific groups. In an interview with representatives of the Los Angeles News Agency, Schmidt said that the Soviet government attaches great importance to the development of the Arctic region. Now, in a short navigable period, it has successfully explored the Northeast Passage of Eurasia. This trip collected many kinds of precious scientific materials about the Arctic Ocean, including icebergs, seawater, and topography, which will be published soon. Professor Weiss, the director of the scientific department of the expedition team, also said that the materials obtained from this trip are sufficient to prove the theory published by the late famous Arctic explorer Dr. Nansen that the climate of Europe is affected by the Arctic is true. The captain of the icebreaker, Voronin, described in detail the various dangers and difficulties encountered along the way, saying that in the Bering Strait, pieces of ice five to ten meters thick struck the ship, damaging a screw. Fortunately, an old screw was used to repair the ship in a very short time to prevent it from breaking apart. The last 100 miles of ice sea voyage was pushed by the entire crew and members of the expedition team to push the ice floes forward. When it reached the living waters of the Pacific Ocean, it was towed by the fishing boat "Ussuriets" to Yokohama. It was found that the "Sibiryakov" left Archangel on July 28th and lost a screw on September 10th. Another screw was lost on the 18th, but it still arrived in the Pacific Ocean on October 1st. The entire journey took 65 days. There were 38 sailors and 27 scientific explorers on board. The latter included the famous writer Pilnyak, the photographer Sinetrov, the journalist Gromov of "Izvestia," and the only woman on board, Rosinova. During their stay in Japan, the team received a warm welcome from scientific groups and government personnel. Prime Minister Saito, Foreign Minister Uchida, Tokyo Mayor Osada, and the President of the Tokyo Academy of Sciences all personally congratulated them. Professor Weiss will stay in Tokyo for another week and give a lecture to the Scientific Association on the results of this expedition. (TASS)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Main Points of the Japanese Government's Opinion <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Formally Announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Slander of Our Republic Unbearable to Read</p>
<p>Our Country's Authorities Should Refute Strongly</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 20th. The following are the main points of the Imperial Government's opinion on the Lytton Report submitted to the League of Nations, which was officially announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at noon on the 21st.</p>
<p>▲ Introduction. The Imperial Government expresses gratitude for the efforts of the investigation team, but due to the short duration of the investigation, the impressions gained by the committee members are superficial. It is regrettable that the team did not visit South China, as this is reflected in the report's lack of optimism. While the report was undoubtedly written in good faith, the selection and collection of materials presented to the committee members is perceived as flawed. It clearly relies on newspaper articles, personal correspondence, and private conversations. It is difficult to determine the value of this evidence, which is used only when it is unfavorable to Japan, especially in regards to the September 18th Incident and the establishment of Manchukuo. In the former case, the motives of the Japanese military's actions are fundamentally misunderstood. In the latter case, the future of Manchukuo's rule is inconsistent with the main points of other parts of the report and with actual events. Finally, the report implies that the Japanese hold deep resentment towards the Chinese people, which is contrary to the facts. Japan hopes for everlasting friendship between the two countries.</p>
<p>▲ Chapter 1: China. Chapter 1 on China is divided into three sections: 1) General Observations, 2) Anti-Foreign Activities in China, and 3) Anomalous Status of Foreigners in China. 1) General Observations: China is not a unified nation. 2) The Nationalist Government promotes anti-foreign education, bearing the responsibility for resistance. The Kuomintang, i.e. the Nationalist Government, should be held responsible, with Japan being the biggest victim. 3) Anomalous Status of Foreigners in China: Foreign powers have extraterritorial rights in China, as well as police and administrative power in concessions in Dalian, Hankou, Shanghai, and other areas. They directly protect their rights with armed force by stationing necessary troops. It is stated that this special status is difficult to apply to a nation like China, even with current peace mechanisms.</p>
<p>▲ Chapter 2: Manchukuo. Chapter 2 on Manchukuo is divided into four sections: 1) General Observations, 2) Zhang Family's Misrule, 3) Japan's Special Status, and 4) Infringement of Japan's Status. 1) General Observations: Points out that Manchuria has never been fully part of China. 2) Describes the Zhang family's misrule in Manchuria. 3) Emphasizes Japan's special status in Manchuria and Japan's cultural achievements. 4) Describes China's infringement of Japan's status, citing China's encirclement policy against the South Manchurian Railway as severely hindering the exercise of commercial lease rights and other treaty rights, oppressing Japanese citizens, especially Koreans in Manchuria, and the Nakamura Incident. It is argued that the Chinese side's attitude of attacking Japan and the bombing incident on September 18th were not without cause.</p>
<p>▲ Chapter 3: The September 18th Incident and Subsequent Military Actions. Chapter 3 describes the September 18th Incident and subsequent military actions, stating that the Japanese military's actions did not exceed the scope of any self-defense. The Imperial Government does not allow external discussion of whether the actions were necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p>▲ Chapter 4: The New State. Chapter 4 is divided into three sections, A, B, and C. A, states that the establishment of Manchukuo and the independence movement of Manchukuo were directed and assisted by the Tokyo General Staff Headquarters, which is completely contrary to the facts. It states that the Japanese side did not participate in the independence movement. B, Concerns the attitude of the people of Manchukuo, listing 1,550 letters from Chinese people whose identities are unknown, and stating that many letters express dissatisfaction. It also states that the people of Manchukuo continue to welcome the new government. C, Concerns the organization of Manchukuo and its future, drawing particular attention to the restoration of security and finance. It refutes the misjudgment that Japan controls Manchukuo and points out that no provision in the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol violates any international obligation.</p>
<p>▲ Chapter 5: Conclusion. The above sections are summarized as follows: 1) China is nearly in a state of anarchy and chaos. If this situation continues, it is nothing less than the collapse of the national entity. However, it is difficult to predict whether a strong and permanent central government will ultimately emerge. 2) As a result, China cannot adequately protect the lives and property of foreigners, especially with the intensification of internal strife and the so-called revolutionary diplomacy. 3) However, foreign powers continue to exercise extraterritorial rights, concessions, and the stationing of troops, as well as the unique practice of permanent warships on inland rivers, continuing unprecedented exceptional powers and privileges. 4) Japan is the biggest victim of China's anarchic state and anti-foreign policy. 5) Japan and Manchuria have close historical and geographical ties, with enormous economic interests and significant treaty rights in the region. At the same time, there are also a large number of residents, and from the perspective of national security, Manchuria has significant political and strategic importance. In the end, Japan's status in Manchuria is unparalleled and exceptionally special. 6) Old Manchurian officials attempted to reverse the aforementioned special status, especially after Zhang Xueliang's approach to the Nationalist Government, resulting in frequent and fierce infringements on Japanese rights and interests. Although Japan has made efforts to ease this situation, it has led to this tense situation. 7) The actions taken by the Japanese military during the September 18th Incident, in that urgent atmosphere, or thereafter, did not exceed the scope of self-defense. From a fair perspective, other countries would have taken the same actions under the same conditions. 8) Manchuria is geographically and historically separate from mainland China. Its residents resent the Zhang family's tyranny and oppose dragging Manchuria into the vortex of China's internal political struggles. The idea of establishing Manchukuo is based on this "protecting the territory and pacifying the people" movement and the spontaneous actions of Manchurian residents, with the Qing Dynasty restoration movement as the main driving force. Manchukuo is making steady progress under a stable policy, and its future is very promising.</p>
<p>Finally, Japan's attitude towards the construction of Manchukuo and formal recognition does not violate any international treaty. What needs to be emphasized further is that the complexity of the China problem is even greater than that of the Manchurian problem. Its anomalous characteristics are unparalleled. It is more difficult to handle this situation with the general formulas applicable to ordinary international problems. The procedures for resolving such anomalous problems cannot be based on precedents commonly applicable to international disputes, as the report states.</p>
<p>Regarding the China problem, the above is based on the Imperial Government's basic view of the points written in Chapters 9 and 10 of the report. The report rejects the restoration of the status quo ante and also considers the maintenance of the current regime to be an unsatisfactory solution. The Imperial Government believes that such a solution does not violate the fundamental principles of international obligations, is consistent with the hopes of the people of Manchuria, and is confident that this solution is the only foundation for stabilizing Sino-Japanese relations. If the new nation, which is developing strongly, is dissolved, it will be placed in international isolation. What the report calls "not suitable for the realities of the situation" means that Japan's relationship with Manchukuo cannot be abandoned to a state of perpetual instability. Therefore, the Imperial Government hopes that the countries will quickly recognize Manchukuo and cooperate to make its development stable and that the situation in Manchuria will be peaceful in the Far East, which is the only way. This is why Japan signed the agreement on September 15th. The report states that the situation has not stopped, which is a profound meaning of the characteristics of the Manchurian problem. The Council of Directors should refer to the opinions of the committee and review the report, hoping to obtain full understanding and satisfactory information about the subsequent situation, which is constantly changing. The changes in the situation in mainland China remain chaotic, while Manchukuo is gradually moving towards development. The Imperial Government is always prepared to provide this information. Among the proposals for solutions in Chapter 10, it is recommended that China and Japan negotiate directly, stating that this is not the function of the committee. This proposal only signifies one example of how to implement the principles of Chapter 9. Japan said that it would quickly recognize Manchukuo, believing that Japan's recognition might somewhat obscure the importance of the proposal. Because the committee once said that even if Japan recognizes the new nation, it may be effective in the report, but it issued it in vague words, so Japan made the above statement. From the above point of view, the Imperial Government's view is: 1) As mentioned later, Principle 10 in Chapter 9 of the report, I am afraid it will involve the international management of mainland China. Similarly, in Chapter 10, regarding the proposals on Manchuria, if implemented, it will call for the disguised international management of Manchuria, which is difficult for both Manchukuo and Japan to accept. 2) This proposal is too precise and complicated and does not fit the realities of the Far East situation. The case put forward by the committee must have a consolidated and stable central government of the warring country as the minimum prerequisite. If the Manchurian problem has no precedent and is complicated, however, if one of the ruling countries does not have a consolidated and trustworthy central government, it will only complicate the situation. 3) Abolishing the military preparedness of Manchuria, such as using international police forces to maintain peace and order, etc., must be regarded as completely inconsistent with the realities of the situation. This is difficult to live up to the hopes of the residents of Manchuria, and at the same time, it is feared that it will cause the unrest and chaos in the area that Japan wants to prevent. This is a greater deterioration of the situation than restoring the status quo. If you talk about the abstract principles in Chapter 9, it is clear that they cannot be applied if China does not have a strong central government. Therefore, in the current state of continued anarchy, it is impossible to resolve these problems without international cooperation, and it is impossible to realize a strong central government. This international cooperation can hardly be imagined without any form of international management. Japan cannot wait for China's reconstruction, because for the reasons mentioned above, the peace and order that is now on the road to restoration is in danger of being destroyed, so no matter what the case is, it will call for new disputes and difficulties. However, is the effort to stabilize the situation in Manchuria truly managed? The world, which has shown so much patience and sympathy for China's re-emergence over the past two decades, welcomes those who have understanding and hope for the new nation in Manchuria? Also, the major Chinese problem is greatly simplified by its own solution.</p>

After the meeting, the White House announced that the cabinet will be able to reduce government expenses by 550 million yuan before the end of the next fiscal year. It was originally intended to save 700 million yuan, but after detailed discussions, it was decided that reducing government expenses to this amount might hinder administrative efficiency, so it was decided to reduce it by 550 million yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 19th. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce today, October was the month with the largest trade surplus in 1932, with total exports valued at 153,000,000 yuan and imports valued at 106,000,000 yuan, resulting in a surplus of 47,000,000 yuan, an increase of 11,000,000 yuan compared to the same month last year.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 20th. The German political situation today is no different from last night. The only development is that the leaders of the National Socialist Party and the Center Party have been negotiating since last night and continued their discussions this morning, which have not yet been completed by noon. At present, almost everything depends on the outcome of the negotiations between the two parties, but it is difficult to predict what it will be at this time.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 20th. Today, it was heard that Hitler had a long talk with General Schleicher after arriving in Beijing from Munich on Friday night. Schleicher is an important figure in the Papen cabinet, a trusted advisor to President Hindenburg, and closely related to the National Right Party and the Steel Helmet. It is heard that Schleicher told Herr Hitler the will of the President and the leader of the National Right Party, Hugenberg, which has obviously been accepted by Hitler himself and the National Socialist Party's war conference. Otherwise, the President's meeting with Hitler today would not have been so long, and there would have been no date set for a follow-up discussion next week.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Su Bingwen Exposes Japanese Conspiracy in Telegram <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sending Komatsu to Manzhouli to Seek Peace with Su</p>
<p>▲ Forcing Legal Groups in Three Provinces to Falsely Attest to Public Opinion</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese side has been spreading propaganda in the northern part of Manchuria, claiming that they are conducting peace negotiations with Su Bingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the Heilongjiang National Salvation Army, and that the war in northern Manchuria will be resolved peacefully. Furthermore, the Lytton Report stated that the establishment of Manchukuo was not based on public opinion. Therefore, the Japanese side specially sent commissioners to the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang to force legal groups in each province to issue certificates supporting the puppet state, intending to deceive the League of Nations. Su Bingwen sent a telegram to Beiping on the cold day (the 14th) reporting that the Japanese side had repeatedly telegraphed seeking peace, but had been rejected. The original telegram is recorded below: "Respectfully presenting the Japanese side's telegrams seeking peace and the corresponding measures, as follows: 1. Telegram from Changchun: To Commander Su Bingwen. The Commander of the Kwantung Army, due to matters to be negotiated with you, has dispatched negotiators to the Manzhouli-Zabaikalsk station on November 7th. We hope that you will also dispatch negotiators to the station at that time. Chief of Staff Koiso, Kwantung Army, winter. 2. Telegram from Harbin: To Commander Su Bingwen. I am now in contact with you to discuss opinions, following the order of the Commander of the Kwantung Army. I have been appointed as the plenipotentiary commissioner and will lead Commissioner Miyasaki and others to the Manzhouli-Zabaikalsk station by plane on the 8th of this month. I respectfully request that you send a representative to meet and negotiate there. It would be even better if you could come in person. The two of us have long been friends with you, and we believe you know that we are open-minded. Therefore, we will certainly do our best for you. We hope you will understand our sincerity and not doubt it. We hope you will agree to a prompt negotiation and inform us of the name of your representative. Komatsubara, Head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Harbin, kowtows. 3. Telegram from Harbin: To Commander-in-Chief Han. Today, Chief Komatsubara of the Japanese Special Service Agency has been dispatched as the plenipotentiary representative of the Commander of the Kwantung Army to the 86th small station on the Russian border to negotiate directly with you and explain all previous misunderstandings. It has been verified that Colonel Komatsubara admires you the most and sympathizes with all your colleagues. Ji and others have been ordered to accompany him for negotiations. We will do our best to protect your personality and find ways to relieve your suffering, with the premise of resolving the dispute as soon as possible. You have always loved the people of Hailun and Manchuria. At this time, when the people are suffering from hunger and cold, we believe you will think of them and come to their rescue. If the hearts of the people of Hailun and Manchuria are not settled, and it is inconvenient for you to leave, please select a senior official to go for a face-to-face meeting. We sincerely pray. Wang Ji and Shao Lin kowtow. 4. Telegram from Bukui: To Commander-in-Chief Han. It is true that Colonel Komatsubara has set off for Daulia. Lin and others are allowed to pass over Hailun-Manzhouli tomorrow. No matter what your opinions are, please send someone to Manchuria for negotiation. Lin and others will do their best to seek peace. Our humble hearts hope to be accepted. Shao Lin and Wang Ji kowtow with seals. 5. Komatsubara took a plane and crossed the sea to the Matishaizi station. It is also heard that the Japanese side is spreading to the Soviet Union that the Japanese side dispatched personnel to negotiate at our request. 6. Shao Lin and others also took two planes across the sea to Russia on the cold day. 7. After investigating the Japanese side's telegrams requesting peace, we have not paid any attention to them, fearing confusion. In addition to making a serious statement to the Soviet Union that we have no intention of making peace with Japan, please promptly publicize this to China and foreign countries to avoid misunderstandings. 8. According to reliable reports, because the Lytton Report stated that the establishment of Manchukuo was not based on public opinion, Chief of Staff Koiso of the Kwantung Army came to Jiang on Dong (the 1st) and forced legal groups in various counties to issue certificates supporting Manchukuo. These certificates have been fabricated and handed over by Han Yunjie, the puppet governor. It is heard that the provinces of Fengtian and Jilin have also adopted similar methods. After investigating the Japanese people's actions, the original intention was to deceive the League of Nations. If we do not clarify and expose the secrets, we are deeply afraid that rumors will spread far and wide, confusing the true with the false. Please make every effort to correct this and clarify the truth. We look forward to hearing more news. Su Bingwen kowtows with a cold seal."</p>

<h3 id="e66">Anhui Northern Grain Permit Fee to Be Implemented <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲ Designated for Road Construction Fund</p>
<p>▲ Grain Merchants in Bengbu Request Tax Rate Reduction</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Anhui Province has established a Grain Exit Administration to collect grain permit fees, which is an instruction from Chairman Chiang to be used exclusively for road construction. During the bandit suppression period, road construction is extremely important to facilitate military transportation. Furthermore, the road construction project is proceeding actively, so a telegram was sent to Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of Anhui, to forward it to the Bengbu Wuhu Garrison Commander to legally prohibit those who oppose the grain permit fee. Chiang Dingwen, the Garrison Commander here, issued a notice to inform everyone after receiving Wu Zhongxin's telegram. The Bengbu Grain Exit Administration has been established for many days. The collection has not yet officially started because the Director, Yu Youquan, went to Wuhu on official business and has not yet returned. Now Yu has returned to Bengbu, and the internal organization is also in place. Most of the sub-bureaus in other counties are still held by the old personnel, without much change, so the collection can be started soon. However, the grain merchants here believe that the permit fee of 3 jiao per stone collected for the export of miscellaneous grains by truck or sailboat is too high, and they have requested a reduction to alleviate their difficulties. Yu has tacitly agreed, but stated that the minimum cannot be less than 1 jiao. This afternoon (the 18th), all sectors held a meeting at the Public Security Bureau to discuss the issue of tax rate reduction. The implementation of the collection will be implemented as soon as the tax rules are determined. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Wuhu Martial Law Department Arrests Yuan Zhongyi <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲ To Be Escorted to Wuhan for Interrogation by Chiang's Order</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Yuan Zhongyi from Hefei has been stationed in Wuhu for many years. During the purge of the Communist Party in the past, he served in the Special Affairs Office and as the chairman of the Anhui Sailing Grain Industry Association. During the recent large-scale bandit suppression in the three provinces, he was appointed as the Rear Guerrilla Commander by Army Commander Wang Jun, but he failed to appease the bandits. Therefore, the position of Guerrilla Commander was terminated. Yuan returned to Wuhu and resided in his private residence Yiyuan outside the North Gate of Pucaotang. At around 8:00 a.m. on the 16th, Zhang Luhe, the Captain of the Wuhu Training Corps and the Martial Law Commander, suddenly sent a squad of armed soldiers led by the Ordnance Officer Zuo Zhiping to Yuan's residence to arrest Yuan and take him to the headquarters on Changjie Street. After the authorities captured Yuan, they announced the telegram secretly ordered by Commander-in-Chief Chiang to arrest him, stating that he would be escorted to Wuhan for interrogation immediately. However, Yuan has a good reputation in Anhui, so various parties sent letters and telegrams to run around and rescue him, but all were ineffective. Martial Law Commander Zhang has sent a team at 5:00 p.m. on the 18th to escort him to the Wuhan headquarters for interrogation. The telegram from Chiang ordering the arrest of Yuan is recorded as follows: "According to confidential reports, there is Yuan Xianshu, also known as Yuan Zhongyi. During the bandit suppression in Anhui this year, the garrison troops, believing that he was familiar with the bandit situation, gave him the title of commander and ordered him to recruit, hoping to avoid disturbing the rear. However, when the crowd gathered, he openly used the name to carry out kidnapping, extortion, and raising funds on the spot. In the past six months, the counties of Luan, Hefei, Shouxian, Shucheng, and Lujiang have all been harmed by him, especially Chaohu, which is his lair. Bandits of this nature are difficult to tame and should be eliminated to ensure the safety of the good people. You should find ways to strictly investigate and arrest him for investigation. Chiang Kai-shek, Yuan Yin." (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Recent News on Guangdong Army's Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhang Gang's Bandits, Si Shun, Were Defeated</p>
<p>▲ Bandits in Dongkeng Were Also Eliminated</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Communist bandits in western Jiangxi, after being defeated by the 1st and 2nd divisions of the Guangdong Army at the bandit nest of Dawangdong, the remnants were fragmented, with some fleeing to Xingguo and some fleeing to Yongxin. Recently, when the bandit grain ran out, they suddenly attacked Shangyou and Suichuan in an attempt to supply themselves. In the battle of Suichuan, after being attacked by the Central Army and the Guangdong 1st Army, they were utterly defeated. Unexpectedly, on the 11th of this month, Zhang Yi's Communist bandits from the 12th Division coveted the defense of Si Shun in the battle of Yongxin. Si Shun has always had the Chen Fengquan battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the 1st Division of the Guangdong Army stationed there. Zhang's bandits, numbering about a thousand, were quite fierce. Fortunately, the Chen Battalion had been prepared in advance and telegraphed Deputy Division Commander Mo in Shangyou County for help. Upon receiving the report, Mo immediately sent the Li Kehuang battalion of the 3rd Regiment to reinforce and ordered the He Lianfang battalion of the 1st Regiment and the Zhang Shumin battalion of the 3rd Regiment to go to Goose Ridge to intercept the bandits. When the Communist bandits attacked Si Shun, they believed that the strength of the local troops was limited and desperately attacked. The Si Shun camp also defended strictly. The two sides fought fiercely all night. By the morning of the 12th, the Guangdong Army attacked the bandits' backs with fierce firepower, and the bandits' formation was shaken. As a result, more than 300 bandits were killed, more than 100 were captured alive, and 200 to 300 guns were seized. Yu Hanmou, the commander of the 1st Army of the Guangdong Army, telegraphed from the front yesterday, reporting as follows: "According to the telegram from Deputy Division Commander Mo Xide, more than 1,000 remnants of the 12th Division, after losing Dawangdong, fled without a fixed location. On the Zhen day, they suddenly attacked Si Shun and fought fiercely with Peng Regiment's Chen Battalion for a long time without a solution. I ordered Peng Regiment's Li Battalion to go out of Shangzhai to Si Shun and attack the bandits' flanks, and ordered Peng Regiment's Zhang Battalion and Li Regiment's He Battalion to set up an ambush at Goose Ridge to intercept the bandits' retreat. On the Wen day, the bandits did retreat to Goose Ridge and were killed on the spot by our pursuers and ambush troops, more than 200 were killed, more than 100 were captured, and a water-cooled machine gun and more than 200 rifles were seized. We are still dividing into three routes to pursue and suppress them. Hanmou kowtows, cold." The telegram also stated, "According to the telegram from Division Commander Ye Zhaowen, the Chen Battalion of the 5th Regiment was dispatched from Ganzhou across the river via Chuhe, and the Zhan Battalion of the 6th Regiment, accompanied by six companies, was dispatched from Wuyunqiao via Baijiantan, and went to Laikeng to suppress them. They came into contact with the Independent Regiment of the puppet Ganzhou County and launched a head-on attack, killing more than 30 bandits. According to the telegram from Li Chonggang, the commander of the 5th Regiment of the 1st Division, about 600 Red bandits were stationed in Dongkeng. Our 5th Regiment dispatched a team to cross the river to the east on Wen day to suppress the bandits. After Chen Shuying, the battalion commander, bravely defeated the bandits, more than 70 bandits were killed and the puppet company commander Guo Shengming and 19 other bandits were captured alive. Our 5th Regiment moved to Shicheng on the 15th." (November 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry Plummets <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ External Dumping of Foreign Porcelain, Internal Heavy Taxes and Fees</p>
<p>▲ Porcelain Merchants Gasping for Breath, Increasing Number of Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jingdezhen's porcelain is the only special product of our country and is extremely famous in the world. Jingdezhen was formerly known as Changnan. In the early Tang Dynasty, Huo Zhongchu, a native of Dongshanli, and Tao Yu, a town resident, made porcelain called "fake jade," which was a tribute and not easily available to the people. It was not until Jingde years of the Song Dynasty that the town was established and renamed its current name, becoming the first industrial area in our country. Since then, special officials have been set up in all dynasties to manage it, such as the Jingde Kiln and Xianghu Kiln in the Song Dynasty, the Longwan Kiln in the Ming Dynasty, and the Imperial Kiln in the Qing Dynasty, which were carefully studied and imitated, and inventions were made in each generation. It was sold to Europe and the United States, and together with silk and tea, it was a major export product of our country. However, due to the simple knowledge of the workers, they were conservative and did not know how to improve. The quality of the products deteriorated. The authorities did not promote or improve, and the taxes and fees were added repeatedly, and the cost increased day by day, so that foreign porcelain took the opportunity to enter. Not only was the international market squeezed out and had no foothold, but also the domestic sales were usurped, with a great tendency to become the master. It is found that in the prosperous era of porcelain in Jingdezhen in the early Qing Dynasty, there were about 150,000 to 180,000 workers, with the saying "thousands of pigs and ten thousand rice," that is, the number of pigs needed per day was thousands and the number of rice consumed was ten thousand dan. The total value of porcelain products each year was always more than ten million. According to the survey of the Construction Department in the 18th year of the Republic of China, there were a total of 1,284 factories and 144 porcelain kilns in the town. The total capital of the kiln households was about 1,369,234 yuan. The output of that year, which can be counted, was: 823,910 yuan for gray ware, 65,518 yuan for large ware, 11,900 yuan for lamp stands, 184,250 yuan for antique ware, 246,345 yuan for carving, 57,380 yuan for official lids, 586,578 yuan for pink fixing, 18,800 yuan for light tracing, 27,820 yuan for talc, 73,900 yuan for tracing jars, 56,607 yuan for small ware, and 317,460 yuan for large pieces, totaling more than 2.4 million yuan. This number is determined from tax revenue statistics, and of course it is not very accurate. According to general estimates, the total value of porcelain products in that year (the 18th year) was about 4 million to 5 million yuan, which is no match for the millions in the heyday. Recently, porcelain merchants from Jingdezhen talked about the porcelain industry in Jingdezhen, which has been affected by foreign porcelain in recent years, and exports have decreased. The capital has been unable to turn around. The town was captured by Fang Zhimin's bandits two years ago, and the essence of the town was swept away. Whether kiln households or porcelain merchants were all gasping for breath. Fortunately, sales started in February and March last year (the town has always regarded May, July, August and September as peak months, and the rest as off-season months). Various gangs in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong competed to purchase and pre-prepared foreign goods. However, after the September 18th Incident, business became deserted again. Porcelain merchants hoped that there would be a turnaround this year, but the Shanghai war broke out and no one cared about it. Large capital could barely turn around, but small capital could not borrow and support was difficult, and they closed down one after another. After the Shanghai war stopped, there could have been a turnaround, but the production and sales tax was levied at this time, and a glimmer of hope was cut off from then on. This production and sales tax is based on the precedent of the previous production and sales tax, mostly 10%, that is, one-tenth of the tax rate is already heavy, and the cost will naturally be high, and sales will also be cut off accordingly. Therefore, the entire town's industry and commerce unanimously opposed it, and the entire city's closure lasted for nearly a week. Fortunately, the garrison did not cause an accident, but the production and sales tax bureau still disregarded everything and detained all the porcelain that was unloaded. Porcelain merchants hesitated, and kiln households and factories all stopped. Although the National Porcelain Industry Association appealed to the central government to issue an order to cancel it, the authorities ignored it and still collect it, so the entire town's porcelain industry has been closed for several months. Although work has resumed now, the 100 or so kilns, which used to be fired every five days, are now changed to once every 18 days, but the goods are still piled up like mountains, and every household has nowhere to pile porcelain. Moreover, the two gangs in Huizhou, who used to hold the financial hub, have exhausted their finances due to the bandit washing in the previous year and cannot release any funds. The porcelain merchants who used to serve as money lenders and pawnshops cannot turn around now and can only sit and wait for death. At present, except for a few who have strong capital and are still starting work, 80% to 90% are in a state of suspended animation. Various factories, households, and kiln owners cannot maintain it and are willing to pay severance fees and dismiss workers. Therefore, the number of unemployed workers is increasing day by day, and it is desolate. If this continues, I am afraid that in a few years, the Jingdezhen porcelain industry will completely collapse. (November 12th)</p>

<p>▲ Transportation Organization Plan Approved</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department convened the heads of construction bureaus and offices from various counties to hold a conference in the province, which lasted for six days. It passed a total of more than 100 proposals from six groups: water conservancy, municipal administration, electricity, administration, finance, and transportation. Today (20th) at 10:00 a.m., a closing ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Construction Department, where Director Dong Xiujia delivered a speech, encouraging the heads of various bureaus and offices not to do nothing because of lack of funds, but to strive to invigorate themselves, exhaust their efforts, and work hard to carry out construction work. Then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>The transportation group's proposals were discussed on the 19th evening. Because most of them were in line with the decisions of the Seven Provinces Highway Conference, they were successfully passed. However, the construction of a light railway from Guazhou to Qingjiang was reserved for the time being due to various difficulties. As for other proposals, (1) completed highways are to be opened to merchants to operate automobiles, (2) a car factory is to be set up, (3) labor is to be conscripted annually for road construction, (4) ship registration is to be carried out, (5) consolidation of Daoqing is to be encouraged (that is, using earth pits to solve agricultural water conservancy disputes), (6) effective maintenance and conservation methods for completed roads, bridges, culverts, telephones, and other projects are to be stipulated, all were amended and passed, and the department will formulate methods for implementation.

Yesterday at noon, Director Zhao Zhen of the prison and detention center, together with the guards, escorted 20 female prisoners from Suzhou to Kunshan. After inspection by Director Miao, who also served as the director of the detention center, they were clearly received and imprisoned.</p>
<p>▲ County Farmers Association Appeals for Poor Farmers Poor farmers in this county often pawned their rice during the autumn harvest when rice prices were low. The local Farmers Bank in this county had set up one or two storage and pawnshops in the past two years. The procedures were cumbersome, the interest was high, and the facilities were not widespread, making it difficult to popularize. Xu Xusheng, the executive director of the County Farmers Association, was aware of this and specially requested the county government to consult with the Provincial Farmers Bank to order the Kunshan branch to provide loans to various district offices, which would act as storage and pawnshops. The facilities would be widespread and the interest would be lower, so that farmers could benefit.</p>

<p>▲ Lü A'gen Sentenced to Death for Premeditated Murder A certain son of Cheng Genfa, a resident of Fenlongqiao Township near Houqiao in the 9th district of the county, joined the Communist Party in the 17th year of the Republic of China. Later, he suddenly regretted it and did not associate with ordinary party members. The party members were afraid that he would leak secrets and be detrimental to the party, so Lü A'gen recruited Cheng's son to go out to eat mutton soup, killed him, dismembered him into six pieces, and abandoned him in Yuanshan Pond. Later, the county government arrested Lü and transferred him to the court to file a public prosecution. Yesterday at 2:00 p.m., Lü A'gen was sentenced to death for the crime of premeditated murder and sentenced to one year of imprisonment for the crime of damaging the corpse. He should be executed.

<p>▲ Villagers March in Teams to Protest Taxes Chen Henian, director of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Bureau in this county, counted that there were more than 1,000 households in the urban and rural areas producing and selling liquor. The total amount of liquor produced annually reached about 30,000 dan. The public sale tax was more than 20,000 yuan annually, and the most was in Xin'an Township. In July last year, the former Wuxi Yin Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau submitted a report to the general bureau for approval to collect taxes in accordance with the regulations. However, Tuo Zhimo Yongsen and others in Xin'an Township recently gathered crowds to march in teams, distributing anti-tax slogans and forcibly resisting. However, according to Article of the Provisional Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol Business License Tax, Item 2, the business situation of each liquor-producing and selling household should be taxed in accordance with the regulations and grades. The households that have already paid taxes have all started to follow suit, and other merchants have also expressed their intention to be treated the same. The general bureau director has been requested to issue a document to the county government of this county to earnestly inform the merchants to cooperate in the collection of taxes. After receiving the report, Director Jiang specially instructed County Magistrate Chen to inform the merchants and people to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations and not to resist on the pretext of violation.</p>

<p>Third General Education Principles</p>
<p>(1) When arranging the weekly homework schedule, attention should be paid to the nature of each subject, striving for a balance between difficulty and ease, physical and mental balance, appropriate time length, and even distribution per week... Special attention should be paid to facilitating contact, ease of teaching.</p>
<p>(2) The selection of teaching materials for each subject should be based on the goals of each subject, with the most important principles being suitability to the current and local needs of society and the experience of children.</p>
<p>(3) The guidance of civics training is not in the teaching of texts and theoretical exploration, but should guide children to practice in the areas of school, family, and social life.</p>
<p>(4) Textual teaching materials should be described in vernacular Chinese and should not use classical Chinese.</p>
<p>(5) The organization of teaching materials should strive to link each subject to form a large unit, so as to reduce the disadvantages of fragmentation, mixing, and repetition.</p>
<p>(6) Before teaching, teachers should have sufficient preparation, not only to fully understand the teaching materials used, but also to prepare a teaching plan (at least a brief lesson plan), appropriate teaching aids, and the teaching environment should also be made as good as possible.</p>
<p>(7) Teaching should focus on "doing", should adapt to the psychology of children, arouse children's reactions, indicate the purpose of the activities to be achieved, arouse children's interest, concentrate children's attention, and guide them to develop activities, conduct their own experiments, and make efforts to proceed, so that children "use both hands and brains", "practice what they preach" to "do" it, this is the only and most important principle of teaching.</p>
<p>(8) All parts of the teaching materials that require children to practice repeatedly (such as the recognition and memory of words, the proficiency of writing, the familiarity of place names, personal names, and dates, the familiarity of arithmetic, the familiarity of songs, etc.) should use the method of "practice teaching", and the conditions that must be taken into account are as follows: 1. The materials should be taken from children who already understand the meaning, 2. The time should be short and the number of times should be many (for example, writing, practice once every day or every two days, each time no more than fifteen minutes), 3. The method should adopt proven experimental methods and should be more varied (several methods should also be used for practice in one short time), 4. Success is only achieved when the predetermined standard is reached, 5. Attention should be paid to the results, first seeking accuracy and then speed.</p>
<p>(9) All parts of the teaching materials that require children to think precisely (such as the problems discovered in each subject, the causes and effects of historical facts, the doubts discovered in daily life...) should use the method of "thinking teaching", and the conditions that must be taken into account are as follows: 1. The following steps should be used frequently to assist children: (A) Action, (B) Discovering difficulties, (C) Determining the location of difficulties, (D) Various methods of solving difficulties, (E) Selecting the most effective method for experimentation, (F) After repeated trials and experiments, make a judgment, 1. Teachers should not be impatient, should not act on their behalf, and should not be arbitrary. Children should be allowed to think calmly. 3. Should earnestly guide children on how to act, how to collect materials, and how to organize materials. 4. Develop children's attitude and habits of respecting objective facts and not adhering to their own opinions.</p>
<p>(10) All parts of the teaching materials that require children to appreciate (such as stories, poems, songs, works of art, natural scenery, etc.) should use the method of "appreciative teaching", and the conditions that must be taken into account are as follows: 1. It is best to let children choose their own materials, 2. It is appropriate to arouse them by implying tones and attitudes, 3. Use methods such as description and comparison to supplement children's imagination and guide children's appreciation, 4. Within the possible scope, it is appropriate to guide children to compare and study various points such as beauty and ugliness to enhance children's ability to appreciate, but it should still be based on arousing children's emotional response as a principle, and it is not appropriate to have children excessively analyze and criticize, so as to lose the purpose of appreciative teaching, 5. The individual differences of children should be clearly understood, and it is not appropriate to hope that everyone will get the same results.</p>
<p>(11) All parts of the teaching materials that require children to express themselves (such as the performance of stories, the production of handicrafts, the creation of articles, the production of pictures...) should use the method of expressive teaching, and the conditions that must be taken into account are as follows: 1. It is necessary to predict whether children can do it successfully, and choose to do what they can do, 2. Choose materials that are easy to get results and easy to achieve the purpose, 3. Have a desired goal and a detailed plan, 4. During the production, teachers should try to encourage children and help children as appropriate so that children can succeed and be satisfied 5. No matter the success or failure, be sure to follow the plan and make results.</p>
<p>(12) Teachers should pay close attention to the achievements of children, and the examination of achievements and the standards of achievement should take scientific methods.</p>
<p>(13) Teachers should clearly identify the children's physical condition, personality, family, environment, etc., observe them meticulously, record them carefully, prescribe the right medicine, formulate a unique educational plan, implement teaching carefully, and strictly examine the results, not only for the increase of knowledge and skills, but also for the cultivation of all good habits of civic training and the elimination of bad habits.</p>
<p>(14) Teaching is not limited to subjects and schools. In addition to subjects, what else to teach and how to use outside the classroom and school, etc. should be studied and implemented at all times. (To be continued)</p>

<p>▲For Aiding the Northeastern Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Municipal Board of Education issued a notice yesterday stating: "Greetings, Since the Liaoning Incident occurred, it has been a fleeting year. The survival of the Northeast, which has been lost but not completely lost, depends on the bloody resistance of our Volunteer Army. The reason why the Japanese warlords cannot safely rule the Northeast and the Manchukuo puppet organization cannot lay a foundation is also due to the bloody resistance of our Volunteer Army. Therefore, the Volunteer Army is the embodiment of our national soul and should be assisted by all our compatriots. Although various sectors in Shanghai have organizations to aid the Volunteer Army, their work does not seem to be able to penetrate deeply into the people, so their strength does not seem to be able to mobilize the masses. Our colleagues in the education sector, as representatives of intellectuals, should take the lead in advocating and implementing practical measures to achieve good results. Now, in order to concentrate efforts to discuss ways to proceed, it is specifically decided to invite colleagues in the education sector in the city to hold a symposium at the Education Bureau Auditorium on Daji Road at 3 p.m. on the 23rd of this month (Wednesday). We hope that you will spare time to attend and jointly discuss ways to proceed. Those who have already started fundraising or have completed fundraising in schools are also welcome to attend and participate in reporting on the process for reference. It is a public convenience."</p>

<p>▲Seven Games in Shanghai, Three Wins and Four Losses</p>
<p>The volleyball team of the West Lake National Art College has been fighting continuously in Shanghai for a week, and they have encountered famous and strong enemies. The five confrontations were very fierce, and the skills were excellent. Their ball skills are only inferior to those of Shanghai Jiang, East Asia, and Fudan, etc., and their perseverance and spirit are very commendable.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, they lost to Shanghai Jiang with fifteen to twenty-one, seventeen to twenty-one, and nineteen to twenty-one. Yesterday, they lost to East Asia again with eighteen to twenty-one, nineteen to twenty-one, and twenty to twenty-two. In a total of seven games, they won three and lost four. It is satisfactory for an inland team to have such results in the Shanghai competition. The team's schedule in Shanghai was completed yesterday. Today at 7 a.m., led by Wang Fuxi, the team returned to Hangzhou.</p>

<h3 id="e93">New Situation in the Maritime Football Scene: Arcale Defeats Lux by a Landslide <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Lux Team Scores Two Goals First, Then Loses Six in a Row</p>
<p>Wyddesh's Substitute is Ferocious and Terrifying</p>
<p>Tung Wah Defeats Yu Yau Six to Zero</p>
<p>| Arcale and Two Strong Teams in the Western League Group A |</p>
<p>The Western League Football Club Group A league, after several rounds of competition, has reached the point of close combat. Strong teams and elite troops must meet and decide the victory. Yesterday's Group A match between Arcale and Lux was the most eye-catching. Arcale is Wyddesh's substitute, and its strength has been talked about for some time. Wyddesh left behind considerable achievements before departing, so Arcale's first appearance received extra attention. As expected, at the Racecourse, they defeated the powerful Lux by a score of six to two. In the other match, Tung Wah played against Yu Yau, with Tung Wah winning by a score of six to zero.</p>
<p>▲ Arcale Defeats Lux</p>
<p>▲ Six to Two ▲</p>
<p>| Wyddesh's Substitute is Terrifying |</p>
<p>▲ Has the Style of Northumberland. The Scottish team Arcale is a team of tough players at first glance. Their footwork is crisp and extraordinary. Their offensive power is better than their defense. Among the forwards, there are many talented individuals. The left wing is better than the right. The center forward, Crag, the left inside Lamond, and the left wing Hughes often have wonderful cooperation. The right wing, McTavish, is slightly slow and careless. The mid-line is not particularly outstanding, but the passing is still good. The right forward, McGlynn, has no fixed position and can lure enemies inside. The defense is strong, especially in the second half. There were a few lapses in the first half. Goalkeeper Henders is no less capable than Tait. He made several excellent saves in the first half. The entire team has the style of Northumberland from last autumn, and everyone is extremely brave.</p>
<p>▲ Lux Scores First But Ends Up Losing Six to Two. However, Lux scored two goals first, followed by six losses. The result of the first half was a 2-2 tie. In the first half, Lux defended firmly, and Arcale was unable to break through, failing to cross the halfway line. Arcale's central defenders were not strict enough, allowing Nayaerjie to advance from both sides and knock on Leegard's door. Within ten minutes after fifteen minutes, Thombrey and Yaerjie scored twice in succession, shocking the entire field, a crisis for the new army.</p>
<p>▲ Arcale Scores Six Times in a Row. Arcale then focused on defense, while the other side seized the opportunity to advance rapidly. The forwards were as fast as lightning. The right wing, Teffey, crossed the ball from a corner kick, and Lamond shot it in with a bang. Crag followed up with another goal. The first half thus ended with a score of 1-2. Only ten minutes into the second half, Arcale scored again. The left wing, Hughes, shot diagonally from the left corner, hitting the corner of the goal and falling in. Lux's courage then vanished, and the army lost its fighting spirit. From then on, it was all Arcale's game, with constant chaos and unrest. Meda touched the ball with his hand, and Hysted lightly kicked in a penalty, making it 5-2. Crag's final header made it 6-2 at the end of the game.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Shots on Goal by Both Sides. Lux had several opportunities to shoot in the first half yesterday, but many shots were missed, inaccurate, or unlucky. When the first half was about to end at 2-2, they shot several times in front of the goal, accurately and powerfully, but all hit the goalkeeper's body or hand, causing the ball to bounce back. It was a pity. Arcale's shots were powerful and accurate, and they liked to hover in front of the goal until they could shoot accurately, making no wasted shots. Once, the center forward shot fiercely, hitting the wood above the goal and bouncing back far away, to the relief of Lux. However, Lux eventually fell apart.</p>

<p>▲ Tung Wah Defeats Yu Yau Again</p>
<p>▲ Six to Zero ▲</p>
<p>| Both Sides' Actions Lacked Harmony |</p>
<p>The Tung Wah football team played against the Yu Yau team again yesterday at the China Baseball Field. As a result, Tung Wah won by a score of six to zero. There were few spectators, and the game was not very interesting. The following is a record of the proceedings.</p>
<p>▲ Tung Wah Lineup</p>
<p>Cao Xianghua</p>
<p>Li Ning Tu Kaiyuan Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Feng Yunyou Li Yichen</p>
<p>Guan Xun'an Wu Youliang Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Chen Yutian</p>
<p>▲ Yu Yau Lineup</p>
<p>Shen Baigui</p>
<p>Zhu Ye Jinmian Shen Huipei</p>
<p>Liang Guanlian Wang Shusen Wang Zhangbao</p>
<p>Qian Yaobin Chen Shifang Xi Qiaosheng</p>
<p>Zhu Shengfa</p>
<p>▲ First Half Situation. The overall situation leaned to one side. Although Yu Yau tried hard to resist, they were unable to protect their goal from being breached. First, Tung Wah's Tu Kaiyuan scored a long shot from 30 yards away, the ball flying rapidly and hitting the back of the net. Later, Chen Hongguang and Chen Jiaqiu also scored successively. The first half ended with a score of three to zero.</p>
<p>▲ Second Half Situation. In the second half, Tu Kaiyuan kicked a free kick towards the Yu Yau goal. Li Yichen got the ball and scored, and soon after, Chen Yutian's cross was headed in by Wan Xianghua. Then Li Yichen scored another goal alone, resulting in a final score of six to zero.</p>
<p>▲ Yu Yau Lacks a Key Player. The first match between Tung Wah and Yu Yau resulted in a score of three to zero. Yesterday's match doubled that score. Yu Yau's main forward, Dong Xiaopei, was unable to play due to illness, and the attacking power was further weakened.</p>
<p>▲ Post-Match Criticism. The actions of both sides in yesterday's match lacked harmony. Yu Yau's center forward accidentally collided with an opponent due to improper action and was ejected by the referee. The Western League has always punished players for illegal actions. Fortunately, the athletes of our Chinese team should not follow suit, and even those who are directly affected should not harbor thoughts of revenge. I hope everyone will strive for this.</p>
<p>▲ Current Situation of Group A</p>
<p>| Tung Wah and Ji Nan Must Both Work Hard |</p>
<p>The situation in the Group A championship has the potential to shift the overall landscape after Western's 2-1 victory over Jinan, and Arcale's 6-2 victory over Lux yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ City Team's Fierce General Joins Western. Parker, a famous player from the Tianjin city team, has joined Western as a center forward, adding a new force to Western. The forwards' strength has increased immeasurably, and Tuina has returned to defense, adding another copper wall. The central defense line is beyond discussion and can be called a complete lineup. Only Xu De is slightly improved, so the Scorto Cup, after eliminating Lux 6-0, and yesterday's 5-2 victory over Jinan, has completely returned to its original state. Tung Wah will face them today and it may not be as easy as before, and the championship hopes are still high for Western, although it is too early to say.</p>
<p>▲ Formidable Opponent Should Be Arcale. In addition to Western, the next most formidable opponent is Arcale. Arcale has taken over after Wyddesh, with only one loss so far. Judging from yesterday's performance, Tung Wah and Jinan should be wary. Jinan will also face Lux, French Concession, Arcale, etc. in the first week of Group A, and their efforts should be doubled compared to Tung Wah.</p>

<p>The China Women's Basketball League originally had two groups, A and B, competing from 5 PM yesterday. However, Jiangnan of Group A was absent due to circumstances and forfeited, so Liangjiang won without a fight. In Group B, Xia Guang played against Nanyang, and as a result, Xia Guang won 29-13. Xia Guang's skills are still quite good, and their passing and shooting are worth watching. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Xia Guang Fouls Points ▲ Nanyang Fouls Points</p>
<p>Xu Ju'e Forward 1 time 0 points Feng Lirong Forward 1 time 0 points</p>

<h3 id="e95">Yu Tianguang Wins Hard Court Tennis Singles Title <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>▲ Defeats Burrenzhi 3-2 Yesterday</p>
<p>| Lin Baohua and Mrs. Medimo Win Mixed Doubles Title |</p>
<p>The hard court tennis tournament closed yesterday at the French Concession General Association. The final two acts were the men's singles and mixed doubles finals, both of which featured excellent performances. Yu Tianguang did not lose hope due to the errors of the referee and linesmen, and finally defeated Burrenzhi 3-1 to win the championship. Lin Baohua and an elderly lady, Mrs. Medimo, saved a dangerous situation with very little hope, and defeated Burrenzhi and Mrs. Dufozhi two to one, also winning the championship. The following is a record of the proceedings.</p>
<p>6 | 4</p>
<p>2 | 6</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang 6 | 3 Burrenzhi</p>
<p>5 | 7</p>
<p>6 | 4</p>
<p>▲ Escape from Death. The singles final began at 1:30. Yu Tianguang served first and attacked first, but lost the first two games, then lost by one to three. He fought hard to make it three to three, and then three to four, finally making it four to four. Yu served hard, regaining one game, and thus escaped from death at five to four. He initially showed his talent and won the first set with a score of six to four.</p>
<p>▲ Utter Defeat. In the second set, Yu's strokes touched the net every time, and he achieved very little. His opponent Burrenzhi attacked fiercely and won three games in a row, then became five to one. Yu was utterly defeated and although he won back the first game, he lost two to six.</p>
<p>▲ Reclaim Priority. Starting from the third set, Yu played cautiously, and both forehand and backhand strokes were extremely strong. Burrenzhi also did not show weakness, and the two sides fought fiercely. Initially, the situation was even, but after three to three, Yu finished it in one go, and regained priority with six to three.</p>
<p>▲ Constant Grievances. In the next set, Yu's momentum became even stronger, with powerful serves and sharp strokes, determined to win the victory. He once occupied an absolute advantage with a four to one lead. However, in the following few games, Yu's serve was repeatedly judged as a "foot fault" by the referee, and Yu became timid and lost his control, allowing Burrenzhi to take the opportunity to attack and reverse the situation to win seven to five. Yu's defeat was a pity. If Yu's serve was a foot fault, then Burrenzhi's "walking serve" was even more of a foot fault, but the referee did not penalize it even once, so everyone cried injustice for Yu Tianguang.</p>
<p>▲ Persist. Yu Tianguang trembled and tried his best to cheer up. In the fifth set, Yu had priority every time. Although Burrenzhi tried hard to follow and did not show any weakness, he finally became flustered and lost points frequently after four to four, losing two games in a row, and Yu won with six to four. Yu thus won the championship with three to two.</p>
<p>5 | 7</p>
<p>Lin Baohua 6 | 2 Burrenzhi</p>
<p>Mrs. Medimo 7 | 5 Mrs. Dufozhi</p>
<p>Following the previous group was the mixed doubles final. Lin Baohua and Mrs. Medimo faced Burrenzhi, who had failed in the singles final, and Mrs. Dufozhi, the grass court tennis singles champion. Lin was paired with Mrs. Medimo, who was older and had worse skills. Mrs. Du's skills were strong and rare to see, so Burrenzhi was quite confident. The audience all thought that the championship would go to the Burrenzhi and Du team. Lin himself thought so too, but the result was the opposite. Lin Baohua fought hard and did not disappoint his hard work, which was a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>▲ Lost the First Set First. The battle began, Burrenzhi served first, and always took the lead, occupying the advantage in one game, which was evened out by the Lin Baohua group. Lin's group's victory can be said to be entirely due to Lin alone. Mrs. Mei rarely made contributions, while the opponents were quite evenly matched. After five to five games, Bur and Du added two games in a row, winning seven to five.</p>
<p>▲ Reclaim Rights. Heaven's Gift, Luck Should Win. On the second set, Mrs. Mei suddenly gained energy, and her strokes were powerful and deep to the baseline. Lin Baohua's strength was added, and he was even more determined to fight and won four games in a row, which was very easy. As a result, Lin and Mei won six to two in this set, reclaiming the rights.</p>
<p>▲ A Bundle of Blessings. The third set was the key to victory or defeat. Both sides played carefully and did not show any weakness, but at the beginning, Mrs. Mei showed signs of weakness again, and made mistakes one after another. Lin Baohua stood alone, and had the regret of neglecting one thing and losing another, which led to the loss of one game in a row, which was terrifying. Unexpectedly, the opposite came, and Mrs. Mei, who was plump, was blessed by the stars, and suddenly changed her weak state, cheered up, and made contributions again and again. Lin got her help and won four games in a row, and took the lead with four to three. However, in the following two games, each lost one, and Lin and Mei still ranked last with four to five. The next game was Mrs. Mei's serve, and the audience was worried for her, thinking that her weak serve would be more dangerous than auspicious, and knew that she had won the game, safely survived the crisis. Then the hope of the Lin group came, when Burrenzhi served, Lin Baohua fought hard to win back, and the next game was Lin Baohua's serve, and he easily scored the last victory with seven to five. Although it is said that it was Lin's effort that led to this, Mrs. Mei's blessing cannot be denied. Although her technique was mediocre, she was able to control it calmly at a critical moment yesterday, which was the main reason for the victory.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Walking Team Practiced Yesterday <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shi Jinsheng First... Two Hours, Twenty Minutes and Twenty Seconds</p>
<p>The International Walking Competition is about to be held, and representatives from various countries are preparing their troops and horses to compete for the championship, and the situation is fierce, especially the British team. Yesterday, Sunday, in the western suburbs of Shanghai, I saw Chinese and Western athletes passing by on the road, all doing full-course practice. More than twenty people joined the Chinese team, and seven or eight people dropped out halfway due to various reasons, while Zhou Yuyu felt unwell when he arrived at the Hongqiao Road intersection, and took a car back to recover his strength. The first to reach the intersection of Mahe Road and Weihaiwei Road was Shi Jinsheng, a veteran of the Chinese team, who took two hours, twenty minutes and twenty seconds. Following him were Xie Xingdao, Lu Chongyi, Ge Jinwen and other fourteen people, and the results were very good. On that day, foreigners who joined the practice included more than ten people from Britain, Ireland, and France, as well as individuals such as Niu Qibao and Ajiek. Except for the French team, which did not complete the entire course, the rest completed the 17 miles one after another. The first person, Niu Qibao, took two hours and twenty-four minutes, and the results were considerable. It is not difficult to occupy the second position in the competition. Secondly, four representatives, such as Tan Weisi and Jin, arrived one after another, and their results were all around 40 minutes, which is a strong rival for the Chinese team. I hope that the members of the Chinese team will work hard and continue to maintain their past honor. The names and times of the Chinese team members who completed the entire course are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1. Shi Jinsheng 2 hours 20 minutes 20 seconds</p>
<p>2. Xie Xingdao 2 hours 37 minutes</p>
<p>3. Lu Chongyi 2 hours 40 minutes 30 seconds</p>

<h3 id="e101">New Basketball Techniques ㈢㈡ (Not to Be Reprinted) Original by Clare Burcky, Jointly Translated by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>This strategy is not the usual action after the center jump, but the person who receives the ball from the center has the responsibility of blocking the opponent's center, which can give the team a lot of benefits, because it can make the team's center, unexpectedly, penetrate deep into the opponent's area and attack unprepared.</p>
<p>Center #3 jumps up and hits the ball to #2. Before #2 receives the ball, he passes it to #1, who cuts diagonally across the court. Then #2 immediately blocks the opponent's center from advancing, allowing the team's center #3 to sprint down the right sideline to receive #1's pass, then dribble forward a few steps and throw it in from under the basket.</p>

<p>▲ Letter from He Minhun and Others to the League of Nations Assembly Addressed to Messrs. Yan, Gu, and Guo, the Three Chinese Delegates to the League of Nations in Geneva, to be Forwarded to the League of Nations Assembly.</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>The primary mission of this assembly is to seek a peaceful resolution to the Sino-Japanese issue. This is something that the Chinese people find gratifying, and we should express our respect to you. However, it is reported that your assembly will seek a solution to the problem based on the so-called report of the investigation team. On this point, we, He Minhun and others, must solemnly inform you of the views of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The Manchurian issue is, in fact, the focal point of the Sino-Japanese issue. From its own perspective, it undoubtedly possesses its own complex international character. However, the process by which the Manchurian issue arose and its subsequent escalation were clearly caused by Japan's historically rooted imperialist aggression against China. The frenzy of the Japanese militarists, the manifestation of their aggressive policies, and the erroneous views of Japanese capitalists all sought to take advantage of the unprecedented global panic to monopolize Chinese Manchuria and Mongolia in order to alleviate their own panic. Consequently, they used the "Nakamura" incident as a pretext to forcibly occupy Chinese Manchuria and Mongolia, falsely claiming to the world that they were defending against Russia in an attempt to deceive the world and create immense chaos and disputes, threatening humanity with the brutality of war.</p>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the Mukden Incident on September 18th of last year, Japanese imperialism has disregarded the condemnation of the world and used force to seize our Northeast Three Provinces. Prosperous Manchuria has been reduced to a desolate wasteland by Japanese artillery fire. The chaos and terror have not only caused widespread disturbance, but they have also created a puppet organization mixed with Japanese ruffians, plunging the lives of thirty million compatriots in the Northeast into the most cruel and displaced conditions of human existence. The loss of life and property, though still lacking precise statistics, is estimated to be in the tens of millions.</p>
<p>In this situation, the League of Nations' Executive Council failed to fulfill its due responsibilities, and the international covenant upon which the League of Nations is founded was completely shattered by the artillery and machine guns of Japanese imperialism. As a result, the military actions of Japanese imperialism have become even more frantic and increasingly pressing. On January 28th of this year, they even attacked Shanghai, reducing the most important Jing'an and Wusong areas, the crystallization of national culture and industry, to scorched earth. The loss of life and property of our compatriots in Shanghai is incalculable.</p>
<p>It is suspected that the intention of Japanese imperialism is nothing more than to divert the attention of the world from the Manchurian issue and to suppress the resolute resistance of our compatriots nationwide to the Japanese invasion of the Northeast. However, the Executive Council failed to impose sanctions on Japan from the outset, effectively allowing the situation to escalate. This is deeply regretted by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The Executive Council considered its best effort to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue to be the dispatch of an investigation team. We do not wish to overly criticize the team itself. Although we, the Chinese people, never had any expectations for the team's visit, we still hoped that the team could provide a concrete and substantial explanation of the content and process of the incident, so that the world could understand the truth of the matter. However, the report submitted to your assembly after the team's six months of investigation and research is merely a display of devious and skillful writing. It not only fundamentally lacks an accurate understanding of the truth and development of the incident but also clearly exhibits a pro-Japanese bias and a major international conspiracy. In essence, it transforms Japan's exclusive occupation of the Northeast Three Provinces into international joint administration, openly implementing the partitioning of China, completely ignoring the rights and demands of the Chinese people. This is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, leaving no room for tolerance. This must be brought to the serious attention of the assembly.</p>
<p>The Manchurian issue itself is the key to world peace. This is obvious and need not be elaborated upon. Japanese imperialism's armed occupation of Manchuria is a direct attack on the Chinese people and, indirectly, a challenge to the world. It has not only provoked widespread resistance to Japanese imperialism's aggression among the Chinese people and created a confrontational situation between China and Japan but also triggered a global upsurge in anti-imperialist aggression among oppressed nations, putting the entire world on a war footing.</p>
<p>Here, the thirty million people of our Northeast, in a world where so-called justice and righteousness are insufficient to rely on, must turn to self-reliance and launch a heroic struggle against the aggression of Japanese imperialism. The "Manchukuo," manufactured by Japanese imperialism, is openly falsely presented as the will of the so-called "Manchurian residents." This kind of blatant distortion of facts further demonstrates its shameful tyranny and barbarism.</p>
<p>The conspiracy of Japanese imperialism is not only to plunder Manchuria and make it its exclusive colony but also to seize Jehol as a base for attacking North China and disrupting all of China, thereby triggering a global war. A few months ago, Japanese imperialism appointed its ruffian Ishimoto Ken'ichiro as a senior staff officer of the Kwantung Army and ordered him to go to Jehol to collude with Chinese traitors and realize its grand scheme to seize Jehol. Regarding this conspiracy and its important and compelling evidence, our army intercepted Ishimoto and seized numerous secret documents. This compelling evidence can be made public to the world at any time. Japanese imperialism, realizing that its conspiracy had been exposed, instead used the Ishimoto incident as a pretext to launch an armed invasion of Jehol, constantly bombing with artillery and airplanes, intending to turn the area between Chaoyang and Nanling into ashes. All the atrocities witnessed in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Shanghai are being repeated in Jehol. All of this could have been personally heard and seen by the members of the investigation team at the time. How can it be denied?</p>
<p>Now, as you convene in Geneva to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue, Japan is once again actively attacking Jehol, launching fierce attacks on the front lines of our army on the Jehol border, forcing our six million compatriots in Jehol, under the threat of violence, to unite with the thirty million compatriots in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang to more resolutely expand the anti-Japanese struggle. As a result, the situation in Jehol is becoming increasingly serious and deteriorating. Jehol is currently a crucial key to war and peace in the future of the Sino-Japanese issue, as well as a crucial key to the future of the Far East. This must also be brought to your serious attention.</p>
<p>You must understand that the current resolute attitude and demands of the Chinese people are entirely due to the violent oppression inflicted upon us by Japan. We have thus gained a deeper understanding. We firmly believe that the liberation of the Chinese nation can only rely on its own efforts. Only the power of our truly mobilized people can shoulder this great mission. However, if you unfortunately disregard our demands, we vow to use our heads and iron blood to exchange for the true independence and freedom of the Chinese nation. The Chinese people's opposition to the aggression of Japanese imperialism is a war of self-defense and will surely receive the assistance of the people of the world and gain the trust of all oppressed nations. This must also be brought to your serious attention.</p>
<p>What must be further stated here is that our resistance to Japan is only a resistance to the imperialist aggression that Japan has inflicted upon us. We have no hatred or malice towards the Japanese people. Our army is a popular armed force in Jehol resisting Japan, and it is one of the armed groups representing the thirty-six million Chinese people in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol. We are determined to coexist with the territorial sovereignty of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol, and we will not hesitate to make any major sacrifices to strive for the integrity of our territorial sovereignty. Here, we do not hesitate to present the following main points to you:</p>
<p>㈠ The Chinese people resolutely oppose any solution to the Manchurian issue based on the principles and recommendations of the investigation team's report, and resolutely oppose imperialist aggression and the partitioning of Chinese territory.</p>
<p>㈡ The demand of the Chinese people is the true independence, freedom, and liberation of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>㈢ Until the territorial sovereignty of Manchuria is fully recovered, the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan will not end.</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the assembly, if you can thoroughly recognize where the key to peace and war lies, you should fundamentally stop Japan from abandoning its imperialist aggression, unconditionally return the Northeast Three Provinces to the Chinese people, immediately withdraw its troops stationed in China, and abandon all rights acquired through imperialist aggression. If you follow Japan's demands and continue to delay and evade this issue, this is absolutely not what we expect from you.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by He Minhun, Chairman of the Military Committee of the National Anti-Japanese Army of Jehol, China; Zhang Zizhao, Vice Chairman; and members Liu Liquan, Li Ciru, Xia Naitang, Wang Shuren, Wu Leiyuan, Yang Zhen, et al.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Japan's Opinion on the Report <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Our Diplomatic Circles... Believe It Has No Value for Comment</p>
<p>▲ Equivalent to Denying All Sino-Japanese Agreements</p>
<p>▲ And Not Recognizing Its Diplomats in China</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency stated that the contents of the Japanese government's absurd opinions on the Lytton Report, transmitted by the Japanese News Agency, are generally considered by diplomatic circles in this port to have no value for comment. However, it is believed that one matter is worth mentioning, namely, that when Acting Executive Yuan President Soong Zi-wen refuted the remarks made by a certain responsible Japanese official, "I do not know where the actual government of China is, who is in charge," he said, "Japanese Minister Arima Akira has just presented his credentials to the National Government a few weeks ago. If the words of the Japanese official are true, it is equivalent to not recognizing his own minister." In Japan's opinion on the Lytton Report, such absurd statements are recorded. This is actually equivalent to a written statement that Japan does not recognize all its diplomatic officials stationed in China, that is, it formally denies the validity of all international agreements between China and Japan. At the same time, it can further confirm the statement of American politician Peck that "When any country signs an international treaty with Japan, it must sign one copy with the Japanese Foreign Province and one copy with its General Staff Headquarters." Not only that, but even the diplomats Japan sends to foreign countries must be recognized by its General Staff Headquarters before they can be official.</p>
<h3 id="e104">China's First Female Aviator, Ms. Lin Pengxia, Goes to the Northwest for Inspection <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Huang Jingwan Hosts Farewell at Moore Memorial Church</p>
<p>Female aviator Lin Pengxia, from Fujian, has traveled to various European and American countries to study aviation, politics, and economics and has gained considerable experience. She is one of the earliest Chinese women to study aviation. After graduating, she followed her father in business in Singapore, but this was not her original intention. Since the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, she has planned to return to China alone to join the volunteer army and work on the front lines, but she was unable to do so for other reasons. When the Shanghai Battle broke out, she resolutely set out and came to Shanghai by ship, but the government had already signed a peace treaty, and the war had ended, while the Northeast Incident had not yet been resolved. Many patriotic youths in Shanghai have organized rescue teams to go north, but the importance of the Northwest is no less than that of the Eastern Provinces, and the Xikang disputes in recent years have been extremely serious, but Chinese people have generally turned a blind eye to it. Ms. Lin has the determination to go to the Northwest alone for inspection and will depart north tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Huang Jingwan specially hosted a banquet at the Moore Memorial Church on Third Road to bid farewell and invited many enthusiastic people in aviation and national salvation to accompany her. Lin Pengxia, Wang Shuzhen, Su Zuqi, and three ladies, and Huang Jingwan, Wu Mai, Yin Zhiling, Tan Bozhi, Xu Beihong, Xu Tongye, Huang Miao, Cao Zhongyuan, and other thirty people attended. During the banquet, Huang Jingwan and Wu Mai gave speeches. Next, Ms. Lin described the purpose of this trip, saying in essence that the importance of the Northwest is even greater than that of the Northeast because the Northeast has always had the support of the Han people, so after it was lost, the people still felt it and issued a painful cry. The Northwest, however, has undeveloped culture and superficial public wisdom. Once an accident occurs, there is no way to recover it. This trip is to investigate the political and economic situation in the Northwest and to find ways to develop it. Many of the people present are enthusiastic about border affairs, and I hope they will pay attention to it. Next, Mr. Shi Dianfeng from Qinghai gave a speech, saying that the land in the Northwest is extremely vast. Taking Qinghai Province as an example, it is about seven times larger than Jiangsu, but the population is sparse, and the financial resources are abundant, but no one is developing it. Xinjiang and Tibet have even larger areas, few Han people, complex customs, and mountains everywhere. They do not interact with the people of Central Plains. They have long wanted to form a Great Tibet country. All the records of the locals say how China is and how the Tibet country is, as if Tibet has been separated from Chinese copyright. Moreover, the Turkish leader once advocated the idea of ​​a Great Northwest country, which would unite Turkey, Afghanistan, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai into a Great Northwest country. The plan has been long planned and is in active progress. Because Chinese people do not pay attention to the Northwest, the actual situation is extremely dangerous. If the Northeast is lost, there is still the volunteer army making a final struggle. The people of the Northwest have absolutely no awareness. This time, Ms. Lin's trip to the Northwest should use the culture of the Southeast to guide the compatriots in the Northwest. Next, Mr. Huang Heqing gave a speech, saying that when he was studying aviation in the United States, he visited a certain place in Hudson Bay where the products and books of the Northwest were displayed. The Americans praised the Northwest as the paradise of the world and said that the Ottawa Conference should be held in the Northwest. Foreign countries pay so much attention to the Northwest of China, but we do not pay attention to it. How can this be? Ms. Lin has the determination to develop the Northwest. We should congratulate her on her success. Tan Bozhi and Yin Zhiling gave speeches on the importance of aviation and national salvation, hoping that Ms. Lin will promote aviation in the various places she passes through, so that the inland people will also have the opportunity to save the country. Mr. Cao Zhongyuan reported on the Northwest inspection by the Science Society for Ms. Lin to use as a reference. Finally, Mr. Yang talked about his experience of serving in the Northwest for more than ten years, saying that the people of the Northwest are all simple, honest, and kind and express extreme friendliness to people from the South.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Chinese Tram Workers Refuse to Resume Work Yesterday Despite Order <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>▲ Union Directors Claim Persuasion Ineffective</p>
<p>▲ Company Decides to Follow the Proclamation</p>
<p>After the Chinese Tramway Company workers went on strike, the Municipal Government and Municipal Party Headquarters jointly issued a proclamation, limiting the resumption of work by yesterday noon. At that time, all the workers resisted the order. The company is preparing to hire new workers to find ways to restore the operation of electricity. The government has decided to punish the workers who resist the order and strictly arrest the leaders. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>▲ Strike Situation After the full strike of the workers in the Transportation Department, the Chinese tramways on lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 continued to be suspended yesterday. However, the French trams, lines 3 passing through the Chinese territory, Xiaodongmen to Ximen, line 5, the railway station to Ximen, and line 6, the 16th Wharf to Lujiawan, all passed through Ximen as usual. In the company at Chezhan Road, only the director of the Transportation Department, Lu Zhonglin, and the staff and workers were left. The fourth squadron of the Police Brigade sent four teams of armed policemen to be stationed there. The waterworks in Gaochang Temple were guarded by soldiers of the security team, and the security was very strict.</p>
<p>▲ Refusal to Resume Work The Municipal Government and Municipal Party Headquarters jointly issued a proclamation limiting all workers to restore to their original state before 12:00 yesterday morning. Yesterday morning, Lu Zhonglin, the director of the Transportation Department of the company, prepared everything according to the manager's order, waiting for the workers to enter the factory and resume work. By 1:00 pm, the workers still had not resumed work. The manager was immediately reported on the situation and reported to the Party and government agencies for verification.</p>
<p>▲ Union Persuasion A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited yesterday.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Fu Chongde and Hu Yida, executive directors of the First District Water and Electricity Workers Union, claimed that after the Party and government agencies issued a proclamation limiting the resumption of work, the directors and supervisors of this union went to advise the workers to obey the order and resume work on time. However, all the workers believed that the company had no sincerity in the salary increase issue. Now, (1) the salary increase issue must be resolved, and (2) injured workers must have a corresponding solution before they will resume work. The union was unable to force them because the workers' will was like this, so it had to wait for legal action. However, it hoped that the company would make concessions and contact the union. Now, the person in charge of the company is away, and the union has no way to contact him.</p>
<p>▲ Bureau Chief Inspects At 11:00 yesterday morning, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, led inspectors to the Chinese Electric Company on Chezhan Road for inspection. Seeing that all the workers violated the government orders and refused to enter the factory to resume work, he instructed the police officers stationed there to strictly guard against them and immediately returned to the bureau. Although the Social Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau were closed yesterday as usual on Sunday, in the case of the Chinese Electric Company strike, in addition to the personnel on duty, senior officials were also assigned to stay behind.</p>
<p>▲ Determined to Punish Strictly The reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Public Security Bureau, the Social Bureau, and other agencies yesterday that the workers who violated the orders of the Party and government agencies and refused to resume work would be dealt with according to the handling steps decided by the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters the day before. The company was allowed to dismiss the workers who refused to resume work, and at the same time, new workers were recruited to actively restore the operation of the trams on each route to maintain transportation. The Public Security Bureau will strictly arrest the leaders of the strike and investigate them according to law. The union, which had failed to provide proper guidance, will also be severely punished.</p>
<p>▲ The Company Expresses A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited the executive director of the Chinese Electric Company yesterday. He said that the company has always treated its workers very well. The average wage is about 30 yuan. Workers with longer seniority and diligent work can receive an additional 136 yuan in wage increases and awards each year. In addition to their monthly wages, they also receive 3.5 days' wages, which are saved and accrue interest in accordance with the 5-year life savings plan, and are paid out after the 5-year term. If they are sick, there are Chinese medicine and designated hospitals to provide medical care and medicine, and wages are still paid. According to the law, those who die on duty have funeral and pension expenses of 350 yuan, plus two years of average wages. In this company, regardless of whether they die on duty or not, they are bound by previous contracts and are paid in full. Often, one worker dies and thousands of dollars are paid. Those with higher wages receive even more than this number. There are also festival rewards for the annual holidays. Such treatment is probably rare in factories across the country. Since 1928, regardless of diligence, good or bad work, seniority, or depth, all have been given a universal increase of 2 yuan in accordance with the agreement. The agreement expired at the end of June this year. The company submitted a request to abolish the universal wage increase on schedule, believing that it was an evil system in theory and in fact. The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued a standard for handling labor-capital disputes the year before last, which also stated that the universal increase system should be abolished because it is an unfavorable measure for both industry and commerce and the workers themselves. At the same time, the company formulated a salary table for workers of all levels and methods for promotion and salary increases to show fairness. Unexpectedly, the union proposed a divided salary increase and other conditions, glorifying it as a demand for equal treatment for employees. How can equal treatment for employees be defined? It cannot be solved in a few words. Moreover, this year is a time of national crisis, and there is also a world economic panic, and the company's business is mediocre, and the cost of living is low. If this can be increased, when will it not be possible to increase? All the reasons why wages cannot be increased will be announced when necessary. However, the workers dared to violate the Party and government agencies' order prohibiting strikes, ignoring everything and suddenly striking in the midst of a mediation that was proceeding in accordance with the law, thinking to hide it by stealing the car keys. However, they did not know that the more they tried to cover it up, the more obvious it became, and it showed that their minds were exhausted. For the time being, let us not discuss where the keys were hidden. Why did the workers say that even if they had the keys after the company issued the spare keys, they would not drive the car today unless they were allowed to increase their wages? It can be seen that this is a very clear organized strike. In recent years, the workers of this company have been extremely arrogant, and they have often gathered crowds to coerce and besiege them. The company has always been magnanimous and accommodating, and has accommodated everything that can be negotiated, hoping for labor-capital cooperation. Who knew that the labor side would make progress and repeatedly pick up trivial matters, relying on the crowd to show off their strength and infringe on the company's right to employ people and drive them away. Last time, in the matter of Zhu Shaoyi, the director of the Transportation Department, Executive Directors Wang Yiting, Gu Xinyi, and Zhang Xiaoliang came to the company to persuade them, but they were besieged by the workers for six hours, and even made rude remarks and refused to listen to persuasion. Recently, because they obeyed the order not to give holidays and double pay on National Day, the workers actually despised the government orders and resented Feng Liutang, the secretary-general of this association, and beat him severely, causing him serious injuries. He has not been able to work until now. In addition to besieging the manager this time, they also destroyed the doors and windows of the manager's office and reception room. This company is a public utility, which is related to local security and the lives of citizens. The actions of these workers should have been rectified long ago, but in this state of violent kidnapping, once rectified, there will inevitably be many problems. I am afraid that the outside world will not be aware of it and will be confused by the malicious words, and all the hard work that the company has put in over the years will be in vain. I had to be patient until now, not daring to intentionally ignore it. Fortunately, the Party and government agencies have clearly investigated the facts and handled them according to law. The company has a glimmer of hope, but since the Party and government agencies announced to the workers that they would resume work at 12:00 am today (20th), this company immediately sent supervisors to prepare for the workers to come to the factory to resume work. However, no one reported to work until the afternoon. The workers' disregard for the Party and government agencies, their violation of government orders, and their arrogant attitude can be seen from this. This company has only to follow the measures in the proclamation "If you dare to disobey, you will be allowed to dismiss the investors and recruit new workers," and has already submitted a written report to the Party and government agencies for record, and will recruit new workers to restore the original state, in order to facilitate the public.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Northeast Recovery Association Yesterday Published an Open Letter to Overseas Chinese Compatriots <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>▲ Elaborating on the hardships of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in the Northeast</p>
<p>▲ Deeply Hope Overseas Chinese Compatriots Will Actively Donate Money</p>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, Cheng Qian, Li Liejun, Bai Wenwei, Zhang Zhijiang, Fu Rulin, and other members of the Central Committee recently contacted overseas returnee compatriots and representatives of the Anti-Japanese armies stationed in Shanghai to organize the Northeast Recovery Association to provide substantive support to the Northeast Volunteer Army, with the aim of recovering the lost territory in the Northeast. The association yesterday specifically issued an open letter to overseas Chinese compatriots, elaborating on the brutality of the Japanese invaders and the arduous struggle of the Volunteer Army, hoping that the compatriots would actively donate money, concentrate their efforts, and save the country from peril. The original text reads: "To our overseas Chinese compatriots: The violent Japanese, relying on their military force, have occupied our Northeast for over a year. The lives and property of the people of the three provinces have been subjected to the slaughter, plunder, trampling, and humiliation by foreign invaders, beyond any calculation. The weak writhe in the arena of knives and saws, while the strong fight for their lives under the arrows. Wherever the iron cavalry arrives, villages and markets are reduced to ruins. Those captured are buried alive, the dead are dismembered, the cruel punishment is worse than torture, and the massacre extends to infants. The grievances of the dead fill the sky, and the remains line the roads. Such a tragic disaster is unprecedented in history. Our military and civilians in the Northeast are not only filled with the fear of national subjugation but also deeply feel the pain of personal experience. Since General Ma Zhanshan began the resistance last October, the self-defense forces and volunteer armies of various provinces have risen like the wind and surged like clouds, fighting bloody battles, advancing wave upon wave, to confront the violent Japanese and have persevered until today. The Japanese invaders have not been able to rest easy for a single day. The righteous cause has inspired the whole country and moved the world. The extension of the frontline in the Northeast has enabled the initial maintenance of the situation. However, the violent Japanese, gaining an inch, seek a mile, and become even more brutal. From occupying the Northeast, they proceeded to organize a puppet state, and recently even blatantly and brazenly recognized it. In terms of military affairs, within two months, they secretly deployed more than ten divisions of heavy troops to various parts of our Northeast, hoping to launch a large-scale offensive when the green gauze tents are removed, launching a three-pronged advance against our loyal and valiant Volunteer Army under Tang Juwu, as a large-scale general attack. This is their vicious plan, which has already begun to be implemented. If the Volunteer Army perishes, then the Northeast will perish with it. If the Northeast perishes, then the areas of Pingjin and Rehe will also perish along with it. Even if our national people do not want to be slaves of the Japanese invaders, how can they possibly achieve it? This is truly a critical moment of survival, and it is what our national compatriots should act upon swiftly and devote all their efforts to. Since the fall of Liaoning and Panjin, the people of the whole country have been heartbroken and shedding tears, all thinking of risking their lives to fight the Japanese invaders. It was only because the government tolerated and conceded, always relying on the League of Nations, believing that justice could provide protection. Now, the report of the investigation team has been published. The so-called advisory conference, Manchurian autonomy, Sino-Japanese new treaty, etc., spare no effort to destroy our country's territorial sovereignty, while expanding the economic rights and interests, consular jurisdiction, residence, and land lease rights of Japan to an unlimited extent. In summary, it is nothing more than using our country's territory for the control of the great powers, and giving the greatest real power and important interests to Japan, who first initiated the incident. This kind of booty-sharing proposal even wants our country's government to make an official declaration, to acknowledge it on their own initiative, and to be responsible for prohibiting 'resistance goods' as a condition for obtaining it. This is not only to seize our Northeast as being sufficient, but also to cut off and suppress the vitality of its recovery. The unreliability of the League of Nations has already been clearly revealed. We have no other hope but to use iron and blood as weapons for self-salvation and self-defense. This is especially what our national people should be clearly aware of and urgently rise up to plan for. Recently, national elders, overseas returnee compatriots, and representatives of the Northeast Volunteer Army have gathered in Shanghai, all considering that the situation is urgent, the enemy is deep, and the danger to the Volunteer Army is imminent. It is appropriate for each to do their best and quickly plan for rescue and support. Therefore, the Northeast Recovery Association was established, proclaiming its purpose and methods as follows: 1. This association is jointly initiated by domestic people, overseas compatriots, and representatives of the Northeast Volunteer Army, focusing on raising funds to support the Northeast Volunteer Army for continued and sustained struggle. In particular, it aims to unite overseas compatriots and the Northeast Volunteer Army, concentrate national talent and strength, form a united group, and mobilize together as the basis for recovering lost territory. 2. This association establishes a board of directors to preside over internal affairs. It temporarily establishes three groups: economic, military, and political, to assume various responsibilities. It hopes that overseas compatriots and the Northeast Volunteer Army will send more representatives to participate in the association's affairs, in order to jointly plan progress and strive for expansion. 3. This association takes a national stand, recognizing that supporting the Northeast Volunteer Army is equivalent to national self-support. Therefore, regardless of party affiliation or gender, anyone who agrees with the association's proposals can join the association in accordance with the articles of association, with the aim of awakening the national people to jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country. 4. The association's economic matters advocate absolute transparency, and are handled by the economic group. Domestically respected elders, overseas returned overseas Chinese, and representatives of the Northeast Volunteer Army are publicly elected, each in a certain number, to serve as economic committee members, presiding over the raising of funds and the disbursement and distribution of affairs, ensuring that the supporters and the supported directly participate and jointly shoulder the economic tasks, in order to demonstrate great credibility and increase practical effectiveness. 5. The Volunteer Army supported by the association must be those currently fighting on the front lines and have been confirmed by investigation. This investigation task is the responsibility of the military group. 6. The funds raised by the association are designated to be collected by the bank (the name of the bank will be notified separately by letter). The above-mentioned points should be followed by colleagues and will not change from beginning to end. The troops inside the passes are all subject to restrictions, and at a time of shared hatred of the enemy, it is necessary to support the anti-Japanese volunteer army in carrying out its obligations in order to achieve the goal of recovering the lost territory. Recent arrivals from outside the passes all say that the Volunteer Army is hungry and has no food, cold and has no clothing, wounded and has no medicine, dead and has no burial. At night, they use grass as their bedding, and when exhausted, they lean against rocks to block the spears and bullets. When retreating, they are also met with the howls of tigers and the cries of monkeys. In the past, from the cold to the warmth, they could barely support themselves. Now, the severe cold outside the passes, with the solid ice submerging their shins, and the Volunteer Army with their bodies of flesh and blood enter and exit from among airplanes and artillery, and must struggle against the frost and snow. This is the first urgent need for assistance. What we hope for from the Volunteer Army is not that they can immediately recover the lost territory, but that they can continue to carry out a sustained resistance. Therefore, battle may not necessarily be won immediately, but it is not permissible not to fight. Attack may not necessarily be successful, but it is not permissible not to attack. Defense may not necessarily be solid, but it is not permissible not to defend. The reason why the violent Japanese do not hesitate to spend huge military expenses and do not hesitate to destroy public justice and international treaties, and must brazenly seize our Northeast, is to seize its rich resources, internally to increase the prosperity of their country, and externally to use it as a base for conquering China and invading the world. After occupying Liaoning and Jilin, they are eager to complete the Jihui Railway, expand the scope of the South Manchurian Railway, and implement immigration and reclamation and other economic constructions. And the task of our Volunteer Army is to destroy their various completed and soon-to-be-completed constructions, and hinder their current and to-be-implemented plans. Although they occupy our land, they will never be able to use the land. Although they seize our industry, they will never obtain the benefits of the industry. If we persist in this for a long time, the violent Japanese, although strong, will inevitably undergo great changes internally. This is the second urgent need for assistance. National spirit is an element of modern nation-building, so the more dangerous the country becomes, the more the national spirit is encouraged, because its will cannot be taken away. Since the Northeast was handed over to the enemy, all nations have ridiculed us, mocking our nation as having no national concept or ability to organize a country. The violent Japanese took this as an excuse to seize it, and the investigation team regarded it as the root of humiliation. There is no greater shame than this. Fortunately, the comrades of the Volunteer Army have risen up on the frontiers, vowing to fight to the death. National glory and national personality rely on this to regain a little. Judging from past battle achievements, the more powerful forces, such as Ma Zhanshan and Li Qinghai in Longjiang, Li Du, Ding Chao, Feng Zhanhai, Gong Changhai, etc. in Jilin and Heilongjiang, Wang Delin in eastern Jilin, Deng Tiemei and Tang Juwu in Liaodong, Zhu Jiqing in western Liaoning, and Geng Jizhou, Feng Guanxiong, Cheng Changkui, Zheng Guilin, Jin Ziming, etc., have all fought hundreds of battles, large and small, with outstanding achievements that are obvious to everyone. Even the other brigade regiments are all striving to be enterprising and generously serving their lives. Therefore, wherever the military forces point, the mad bandits are swept away. They entered Shenyang before and recovered Jilin Province later. Although they all withdrew due to insufficient weapons and ammunition, their loyal and courageous spirit is enough to reach the clouds and chill the enemy's courage. Recently, Su Bingwen, Zhang Xiangge, and other brigades of more than 20,000 people have once again rebelled and united in various parts of Manzhouli, driving directly to the Black Border. Taking into account the three provinces, the Volunteer Army with systems and organization has no less than 400,000 people, destroying their homes to relieve the country's difficulties and sacrificing their lives to save the country. Everyone shares the same heart. If our national compatriots can take advantage of the situation to rise up and provide assistance, filling their military strength, providing them with weapons and ammunition, and providing them with clothing, food, and supplies, it will not be long before all the compatriots in the Northeast become volunteer soldiers, and the return of our land is not far away. This is the third urgent need for assistance.</p>
<p>The compatriots outside the passes are stretching their necks and looking forward, their eyes full of blood and tears, looking forward to our national people for a long time. For the past year, people at home have been running around shouting and advocating for donations and assistance, and have also exhausted considerable efforts. And our overseas Chinese compatriots, gathering large sums of money, have been remitting them continuously, which is especially enthusiastic and touching. However, because the Volunteer Army is located on the border, the passes and rivers are far away, and they are restricted and imprisoned, and the overseas compatriots are ten thousand miles away, separated by the ocean, and it is even more difficult to connect with them. Therefore, even though assistance is provided, the needs of the military are urgent. It can be seen that this matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to achieve success without relying on the wisdom and efforts of the masses. And the people at home, the overseas Chinese compatriots, and the Northeast Volunteer Army, are especially unlikely to achieve full effectiveness unless they are united and concentrate their entire strength. This is what the members of this association should strive to implement day and night. Overseas Chinese compatriots are devoted to the motherland, as is known to all colleagues. In the creation and maintenance of the Republic of China, they often save on food and clothing and enthusiastically donate money, becoming the pioneers of the people at home. Now, at the beginning of the organization of the association, we hereby state the outline to inform you, hoping you will carefully consider it. Initiated by the Northeast Recovery Association, standing directors Cheng Qian, Li Liejun, Bai Wenwei, Zhang Zhijiang, Fu Rulin.</p>

<p>The National All Circles National Salvation Organizations Federation yesterday telegraphed Su Bingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army, saying, "We have just learned that your army is now engaged in a bloody battle with Japanese soldiers in Fularji, which fills us with great joy. The Japanese bandits seizing the territory of the Eastern Provinces is truly an unprecedented shame for our country. Now, your army is bravely resisting, fighting tirelessly between the Changbai Mountains and the Heilong River, fighting bloody battles in the icy and snowy lands, holding the determination to die, and fighting the Japanese army desperately. Although the powerful bandits are enticing with benefits, they will not compromise. Their loyal hearts and red blood can be seen by heaven and earth. Now, as they continue to work hard, the elimination of the violent Japanese is not far off. Protecting our territory is certainly possible. Our association now gathers the strength of the entire population, vowing to be your rearguard. We hope that you will strive to fight, persevere to the end, drive out the enemy troops, and sweep away the traitors. The future of the nation truly relies on you. In this telegram, we extend our sincere prayers. The National All Circles National Salvation Organizations Federation."</p>

<p>▲ The Variety Show Was a Great Success</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, in view of the tense situation in Northern Manchuria, believes that if assistance is not provided continuously, there will be no way to supply food and boost morale. Therefore, it decided yesterday to allocate 40,000 yuan to provide assistance. As for how this money will be distributed, it will be discussed at tomorrow's regular meeting, so that it can be remitted immediately, and a telegram will be sent requesting continued efforts in the anti-Japanese work and perseverance to the end.</p>
<p>The variety show held by the association last night at 7:00 PM at the Tianchan Stage was attended by upper-class people. The front of the stage was crowded with cars and horses, and the tickets for the flower balconies and boxes were completely sold out. Although there were a few who purchased the tickets but did not go to the show, the seats were still filled with people, showing that people sympathize with the aid to the Volunteer Army. And all the amateur performers and artists also showed their skills, performing vividly and colorfully, truly extraordinary. Even today's variety show tickets were purchased from the association yesterday in an endless stream.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Five of the Seven Robbers Are Fugitives from Taicang Prison <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>▲ Committed Six Robberies in Shanghai</p>
<p>▲ Several Robbers Admitted, Several Robbers Prevaricated</p>
<p>The bandits Sheng Yunsheng, Zheng Shanghe, Zou Zhongxi, Chen Chunhe, Li Guodong, Gao Yunshan, and Xu Shouzheng, between March and October of this year, formed a gang and held weapons to rob Chen Anquan at No. 54 Dongxi Huaide Road, Chen Wangshi at No. 103 Xinji Bang Road, Xu Xinfu at No. 87 Baker Road, Liu Laowu at No. 31 North Chengdu Road, Wang Weiwen at No. 350 Tangjia Lane, and Yin Yangshi at No. 273 Donghan Bili Road, etc., for property worth more than 1,500 yuan, and fled. After the case was exposed, they were successively arrested by Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Patrol Room, and a pistol and five bullets were seized. They were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Linyu came to the Third Criminal Court to interrogate the defendants separately. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the patrol room, stated, "Please expedite the conclusion of this case, as the defendants, except for Zou Zhongxi and Chen Chunhe, are all escaped prisoners sentenced by the Taicang District Court. They will be transferred." When questioned, Sheng Yunsheng admitted to robbing North Chengdu Road once, Zheng Shanghe admitted to North Chengdu Road, Tangjia Lane, and Donghan Bili Road three times, Zou Zhongxi admitted to Tangjia Lane once, Chen Chunhe completely denied it, Li Guodong claimed to have been a special agent in a certain army, but had already resigned and came to Shanghai to look for friends but failed to meet them and was detained while staying at the Aido Hotel, and overturned his previous confession to the patrol room regarding the Dongxi Huaide Road case, Gao Yunshan and Xu Shouzheng both denied robbing and made evasive statements. The patrol room lawyer Zhang detailed the confessions of Chen, Li, Gao, and Xu, who were pointed out by Sheng Yunsheng and Zheng Shanghe as accomplices in robbing Chengdu Road, Dongxi Huaide Road, and Baker Road. Judge Zhao declared to the four defendants, Chen, etc., "How can you exonerate yourselves by prevaricating in court?" He then appointed lawyers to defend each defendant pro bono and ordered them to be remanded in custody pending sentencing. It was found that the crimes committed by the defendants in Taicang who had been sentenced were Sheng Yunsheng and Zheng Shanghe (both robbery), Li Guodong and Gao Yunshan (both cigarette workers), and Xu Shouzheng (kidnapping). All five criminals escaped from prison on March 3 of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Water Disaster Relief Committee Invites Representatives from All Sectors to Inspect and Repair Dike Works in Various Regions <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>▲ Departing from Shanghai on the 26th of This Month</p>
<p>The National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee, in order to inspect the dikes along the Yangtze, Huai, Han, and Yun rivers and water diversion projects repaired with work relief funds, hosted a banquet yesterday noon at the Bank Club for representatives from various sectors. Those in attendance included Simpson, F.W.S. Oehme, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, Zhang Shouyong, Zou Bingwen, Zhao Jinqing, Li Zhaohuan, Pan Xulun, Yu Xiji, Tai Xieqing, Wu Zhihao, Wang Zhixin, (Xu Peihuang as representative for) Wu Tiecheng, Chen Liting, Liu Yunfang, as well as the Committee's Secretary-General Zeng Rongfu, Committee members Li Zushen, Huang Renlin, and over fifty others. Committee Chairman Song Ziwen was absent due to other engagements. The banquet was presided over by Vice-Chairman Sir Simpson, who delivered a speech, followed by Secretary-General Zeng Rongfu, who reported on the progress of dike repairs and the significance of inviting representatives from all sectors for inspection. Next, the Director of the Committee's Engineering Department, Xi Mingjiu, reported on the itinerary for inspecting the various engineering sections and immediately sought out attendees willing to conduct the inspection. Those who signed up at the time included Zhang Shouyong, Liu Zhanen, Li Zhaohuan, Lin Kanghou, Wen Lanting, Chen Liting, Yu Xiji, Wu Zelin, Wu Zhihao, and the foreigner F.W.S. Oehme, totaling over ten people. The event concluded at 2:00 PM. Regarding the inspection of dike projects, the Committee has appointed Huang Renlin as the chief host, with Zeng Rongfu also serving as the Deputy Director of the Preparations Office, responsible for internal matters, to ensure swift progress. A separate record of Mr. Li's report and the scheduled inspection itinerary is provided below.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Li's Report Mr. Li Zushen reported, in brief, that last year's devastating floods prompted the Committee to implement work relief measures in addition to providing emergency relief, with the aim of addressing the fundamental problem. The decision was made to repair various dike sections and water diversion projects using work relief methods. While the floodwaters were still receding, the Vice-Chairman, accompanied by water conservancy engineering experts, conducted aerial surveys of water levels and topography. Once the floodwaters had receded, the Engineering Department, in conjunction with the provincial Construction Bureaus and Water Conservancy Bureaus, commenced construction, which took a year to complete. The required funding was largely provided by generous donations from various sectors in Shanghai. Their deep concern for the people's livelihoods and their emphasis on water conservancy are deeply appreciated. With the completion of the dike works, representatives from all sectors are respectfully invited to inspect the results, demonstrating that the donated funds have not been wasted and to seek guidance, ensuring further improvements, ultimately achieving lasting benefits and preventing future flooding.</p>
<p>▲ Invitation for Inspection The original letter from the Committee inviting representatives from all sectors to inspect the works reads: "Respectfully informing you, the floods last year caused immense devastation. In addition to providing emergency relief, this Committee, adhering to the principle of 'work for relief,' has repaired the main dikes along the Yangtze, Huai, Han, and Yun rivers, as well as the water diversion projects in the lower reaches of the Huai River, all of which have been completed one after another. Since the establishment of this Committee, we have deeply appreciated the enthusiastic support from society and the generous donations, for which we express our profound gratitude. This Committee has scheduled a trip on November 26th, renting a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company vessel, to depart from Shanghai and conduct an inspection along the works. We have long admired your concern for water disasters and your emphasis on dikes and dams. Therefore, we have sent this special invitation, hoping you will condescend to join us and personally inspect the works. Your invaluable guidance and supervision will benefit the thousands of miles of dikes. We would be extremely fortunate. Enclosed is a schedule of the inspection project dates. We respectfully request your review. If you are willing to accept this invitation, please respond within two days, and we will send you a boarding pass. We will wholeheartedly await your arrival."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Northeast Refugee Relief Association Sends Out Donation Boxes <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations' Joint Relief Association for Refugees, realizing that raising funds for the refugees has become increasingly difficult due to the ongoing national crisis, has resorted to broader appeals in hopes of accumulating small contributions. Yesterday, they sent out donation boxes to various public places, along with a letter stating: "Respectfully informing you, our compatriots in the Northeast have long suffered from the ravages of war and now face devastating floods. The dire situation is beyond words. We have established this association to raise funds for relief efforts. However, the disaster area is vast and the number of refugees is immense. It is difficult to provide comprehensive assistance without raising substantial funds. In addition to individual appeals, we have specially made donation boxes to be placed in busy locations, allowing kind-hearted individuals to make voluntary contributions. We hope that your esteemed organization (institution) (company) (hospital) will kindly display the box in a prominent location, making it easy for people to donate without coercion. When the donation box is full, please notify this association by telephone, and we will send someone to jointly unseal and count the contents, issuing a receipt. We kindly request your attention to this matter, as it concerns a benevolent act of disaster relief. Please take prompt action and reply to this letter. Furthermore, the Association received a reply from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association yesterday, stating that, in response to the request to encourage members to donate a percentage of their sales for relief, the Association had previously received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, including measures for Shanghai industries to donate to the Northeast refugee relief effort. The Association had already resolved in a meeting to adopt the monthly donation method for six months. Although the fundraising channels are different, the relief destinations are the same. We inform you of this specifically for your information."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Li Guojie's Tuberculosis Returns While in Custody <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲ His Family Hires Jiang Yiping and Li Shirui for Legal Support</p>
<p>▲ Court Approves Bail Yesterday, but Release Delayed Due to Weekend</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was placed under surveillance after allegedly authorizing the unauthorized leasing of four godowns to the American China Trading Company. He was transferred to the District Court the day before yesterday. Now, Li Guojie is seriously ill, and his family has hired lawyers to seek bail for medical treatment. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Condition Worsens After being transferred from the Public Security Bureau to the District Court, Chief Prosecutor Xie Lian conducted two court hearings, charging him with dereliction of duty and malfeasance. He was ordered to be remanded to the court detention center. However, due to Mr. Li's weak constitution and advanced age of 51, he suffered from tuberculosis. The old ailment has recurred after being placed under surveillance. He has been coughing frequently since the night before, and although he has been treated by a court physician, there has been no improvement.</p>
<p>▲ Bail Approved After Mr. Li Guojie was detained, his family hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Shirui as his representatives, requesting legal support. A reporter from "New Voice News" learned from lawyer Jiang yesterday that the court had approved bail pending further investigation, requiring him to be available for questioning at any time. Therefore, lawyer Jiang, along with Mr. Li's relatives, went to the District Court yesterday morning to request bail. However, as yesterday was Sunday, there were no responsible personnel at the court, so the effort was unsuccessful. It is now reported that bail will be posted today.</p>
<p>▲ Wife's Visit Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mrs. Li, accompanied by relatives, visited him and brought clothing and other items. A reporter from "New Voice News" encountered Mrs. Li at the District Court and asked about Mr. Li's condition. She said that he was extremely heartbroken after being placed under surveillance and that his old illness had recurred and worsened.

Private vessels registered for domestic port travel will still be allowed to continue trading between Niuzhuang, Andong, and other domestic locations, but foreign goods transported from Niuzhuang and Andong may only be directly transported to domestic coastal areas with established customs offices, otherwise, the vessel and cargo will be confiscated.

<p>▲ Grain Association Urges Prompt Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association reports that soybean oil shipped from Yingkou, Andong, and other places in eastern Liaoning to Shanghai is now classified as foreign goods and taxed at several times the previous rate, creating an unbearable burden. The association has sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that it continue to be taxed as domestic goods, and has also sent representatives to Beijing, carrying a petition to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance. However, no response has been received. Therefore, the association recently sent another telegram to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, stating: "The case of soybean oil shipped from Yingkou and Andong to Shanghai, requesting that it continue to be taxed as domestic goods, has not yet been approved. The northern rivers are freezing soon, and the need for supplies in various places is critical. If a quick solution is not found, the supply will be interrupted during the three to four months of the freeze, and the people's livelihood will be severely affected, leading to panic. We urge you to approve the request as soon as possible." Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Committee Urging Dredging of Puhuitang River Visits Zhang and Hu <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reported that Surveying of Songqing River Section Began Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Requested Transfer of Consultation to Municipal Public Works Bureau for Assistance</p>
<p>The shallow and polluted Puhuitang River in western Shanghai is detrimental to the people's livelihood. Local gentry such as Ma Xiangbo organized a committee to urge dredging of the river and repeatedly requested the municipal government and the Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee to allocate funds for dredging. The Rehabilitation Committee sent personnel to inspect the site and concluded that dredging was indeed necessary. They then submitted a report to the Executive Yuan and replied to the committee, requesting them to quickly prepare an estimate of the earthwork project so that funds could be allocated for construction, as previously reported. It is now learned that the committee has held a meeting and decided to invite specialized personnel to conduct surveying and prepare an estimate. As it is now winter, the appropriate time for dredging, the committee, eager to proceed, again dispatched representatives Yang Xinzheng, Chen Yafu, Li Youxian, and Gu Junjie to visit Zhang Shouyong and Hu Junzhuang, the executive member of the Rehabilitation Committee, to report that surveying of the Songqing River section has begun due to the harmonious cooperation between the governments of the two counties and the local gentry. They requested that the Municipal Public Works Bureau be consulted to assist in the Shanghai section, as the river is longer there, so that a complete estimate of the entire river can be prepared soon and bids can be invited for construction. They also stated that the Zaohua Bang River is polluted by sewage from the ditches on both sides, which flows into the river for dozens of miles, making the entire river black and smelly. Therefore, improving water conservancy requires the construction of a dam to intercept the flow to benefit the people's livelihood. Mr. Zhang also agreed that stopping the flow of foul water was indeed important, and that the construction of a dam and the diversion of the river had already been decided. "You are all enthusiastic about the local area, so please work hard and don't worry," he said. The representatives all said that they were grateful for the concern of Zhang and Hu for the people's suffering and expressed their gratitude on behalf of the people along the river.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Coal and Stone Barge Industry Requests Relief for Inland Waterway Transportation <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲ Please forward to the Central Party Headquarters through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, in the 14th resolution of the general meeting of your association on June 18th of this year, a request was submitted to the government to determine the ship registration authority to avoid double taxation. However, ships sailing in Zhejiang province still have to pay the ship license fee levied by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, amounting to a substantial four yuan and fifty cents to eight yuan per month, which are similar to miscellaneous taxes and should be abolished uniformly. Resolved, approved, and vigorously pursued. On June 26th of the same month, your association submitted a document to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, ordering investigation and prohibition to maintain the rule of law and avoid excessive taxation. On June 27th, a telegram was sent requesting the central government to delineate the scope of registration of the Maritime Affairs Bureau. However, five months have passed without approval. Moreover, at a time when commerce is declining and crises are looming, all ship merchants in the city are extremely apprehensive. If this continues, inland waterway transportation may even go bankrupt. Furthermore, we read in the newspaper on the 6th of this month that the Ministry of Communications, in response to the Shanghai Municipal Government's consultation on amending the organizational law of the Maritime Affairs Bureau to abolish the inland waterway registration office of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, replied to the Executive Yuan, stating, 'Received the Shanghai Municipal Government's consultation, according to</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>the Public Works Bureau's reply, the Bureau of Maritime Affairs' ship registration is handled in accordance with the provisions of the Maritime Law, Ship Law, and Ship Registration Law, issuing nationality certificates to determine nationality and property rights, while the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau registers ships to manage shipping administration within the Shanghai city area and maintain water public safety, which is the basis for collecting ship taxes. The authority and responsibility are clear.' In fact, the Maritime Law, as its name suggests, applies to ships sailing at sea, and nationality certificates were originally issued to manage foreign merchants. The registration of the Municipal Public Works Bureau is also handled in accordance with the Ship Law and Ship Registration Law. Now, the Maritime Affairs Bureau should not rely on the above two laws to re-register ships that have already been registered. Moreover, inland waterway merchants are all Chinese, and there is no need for proof of nationality. Even if proof of nationality is required, the ships already registered by the local government are sufficient to prove their nationality, without the need for double registration. The logic is also very clear. Moreover, inland waterway transportation relies on meager freight to maintain livelihoods. In recent years, taxes have become complex, and shipowners have been unable to cope. After registering and paying ship taxes with the Municipal Public Works Bureau, they must also pay ship license fees when traveling through Zhejiang province. Now, the authority of the Maritime Affairs Bureau has further encroached upon inland waterways, establishing registration offices in Minhang and Wusong, adding another layer of burden. Under these circumstances, the bankruptcy of the shipping industry is imminent. Therefore, we especially request your association to argue based on reason, submit a request to the Central Party Headquarters, and forward it to the Third Plenary Session to grant relief, and to promptly correct the registration issue for inland waterway vessels and the ship licenses in Zhejiang province according to law, to maintain commercial transportation."</p>
<h3 id="e125">Workers at the Fuli Rubber Factory Declared Resumption of Work Yesterday Morning <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲ Further submit to the Party and government for prompt mediation</p>
<p>All workers at the Da Zhongguo Fuli Rubber Factory on Xingjiazhai Road, Zhabei, demanded the restoration of their original wages, but to no avail. Instead, four representatives were dismissed by the management, leading to widespread indignation and a slowdown in work starting the day before yesterday. After officials from the Party and government were dispatched to persuade them, they resumed work yesterday morning. The labor side has submitted another request to the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, as detailed below.</p>
<p>▲ Resumption of Work Yesterday Morning After all workers at the factory declared a work slowdown, Zhao Zhenhua from the Municipal Party Committee and Chen Mingshan from the Social Affairs Bureau rushed to the factory at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday and earnestly persuaded the striking workers to resume work first and await resolution to avoid escalating the unrest. The workers expressed their acceptance but stated that it was too late to resume work that day, so all workers declared resumption of work yesterday morning.</p>
<p>▲ Labor's Submission After resuming work, the labor side submitted separate documents to the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting prompt mediation. The original submission stated, "Respectfully submitted to ensure that all workers can work with peace of mind, requesting that the management be promptly ordered to provide a substantial response to the labor's demands to facilitate resolution of the dispute and protect workers' livelihoods. The workers, unable to withstand the oppression of the management, elected representatives and requested assistance from your departments. However, during the mediation period, the management forcibly pressured some workers to sign documents, causing panic among the workers who did not understand the truth, leading to the collective action of all workers leaving the factory on the 18th to petition your departments. All circumstances have been submitted by the representatives successively and reported verbally. It is found that the workers had no intention of slowing down work, but after the collective petition, they immediately returned to the factory to work. However, upon arriving near the factory, they suddenly saw a large contingent of police officers fully armed stationed inside and outside the factory. The factory manager, Yang Yongnian, and his wife also took separate cars to stop workers on the roads around the factory, causing the workers to fear entering the factory. On the 19th, after your departments dispatched personnel to investigate, they ordered the representatives to persuade all workers to enter the factory. Now, the workers have been persuaded by the representatives and have all entered the factory on the 20th. Based on the above facts, the responsibility for all disputes should be borne by the management. However, since the points raised by the workers have not been resolved and there is no definite response from the management as to whether they sincerely accept them, there is deep concern that the management may resort to other schemes. The workers are simple-minded and constantly apprehensive, so they instructed the representatives to submit another request to your departments to promptly order the management to begin negotiations to seek resolution and avoid other complications, and to protect workers' livelihoods. This is submitted with utmost urgency to the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau."</p>

<h3 id="e131">County Finance Bureau Strictly Urges Payment of Past Due Land Tax <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau found that the heads of various districts and townships in the county had substantial amounts of land tax arrears from the handling of land tax matters in the past. Despite repeated urging for payment, they have mostly turned a deaf ear. As the provincial treasury is now depleted, the Finance Department has repeatedly issued strict orders to expedite the collection and remittance of funds. Therefore, Director Wang has submitted a list of land tax arrears owed by the heads of various districts and townships to the County Government, requesting the County Government to instruct the district heads to order the indebted heads of various townships to promptly arrange for payment. If they continue to disobey, disciplinary action will be taken without leniency.</p>

<p>Maotai Foreign Goods Store at 310 and 312 Xinzha Road was visited by two male customers on the afternoon of the 18th, one wearing a long blue robe and the other wearing a long gray robe.

<p>Yesterday, the Hongkou Public Epidemic Hospital held a meeting to handle the closing.

Then, the director of medical affairs, Mr. Wang Boyuan, reported that since the hospital opened, no fewer than 13,000 people have sought treatment, and the number of those cured is uncountable. All fees and registration charges were waived for the general public seeking treatment, which is all thanks to everyone, and not only I am blessed, but also the general patients are deeply grateful.

<h3 id="e134">Assassination Case in Yanhai Road <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲ Four Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>On the evening of the 9th of this month, at around 7:00 PM, Zhang Zhigang (aka Zhang Asi) was shot and killed on Yanhai Road inside the Old North Gate, and the criminals escaped in the meantime. The Municipal Public Security Bureau received a tip that Zhang Xinsheng, who lives at 126 Fuyou Road and makes bone goods, and Jiang Asan, who lives at 157 on the same road, conspired to commit the murder. Director Wen immediately ordered officers from the Second Branch of the First District and the First Branch of the Second District to jointly arrest them. At 6:30 AM yesterday morning, Officer Hong Wensun and Wang Zhongqing of the First Branch of the Second District, under orders, led Sergeant Li Baoliang, Ma Yumin, Zhang Yichang, and Police Officers Wang Fengzhu and Zhou Ming, together with Police Officer Liu Chaoxiang of the Second Branch of the First District, secretly went to 126 Fuyou Road and arrested Zhang Xinsheng. They then went to 157 Fuyou Road and arrested four suspects, Ge Xingquan, Pan Jinsheng, Zhou Guirong, and Xu Weiquan. However, Jiang Asan was out at the time and escaped the arrest. They were all taken to the First Branch of the Second District for interrogation. According to the interrogation by Director Xu, Zhang Xinsheng and others confessed that Jiang Asan is a fellow trader whom they have known for more than ten years. When I got married yesterday, he came to give gifts and drink wine, but he did not live with me. He has no fixed place of residence and no fixed business. He usually lodges at the homes of various friends, especially at the home of Jiang Mingzhu in Beizhangjia Alley or at the Louis Industrial Factory on Singapore Road, etc. According to Ge Xingquan and others, the four of us work together and are in the bone goods business. We do not associate with Jiang Asan, but because of our business relationship, he did come to play and stay for one night three or four days ago, but we do not know the rest. As the case is related to conspiracy and the arrest was ordered, they were all sent to the Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Handgun Found in Thatched Hut <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲ Five People Arrested and Sent to the Bureau</p>
<p>Lu Ying, the captain of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, in view of the upcoming winter defense period, supervised his subordinates to take turns going to the main passes in shifts from 3:00 AM to 9:00 PM every day to check pedestrians and vehicles. Particular attention was paid to all public places, hotels, teahouses, etc. The day before yesterday afternoon, Captain Lu received a report from Team Leaders Liu Shaoqing and Wu Xiufeng, who were sent to the Shanghai West Inspection Group, that they had joined the chief of the Sixth District General Office, police officers, and detectives from the Shanghai West Office of the team, Yu Maolong and Pei Yunzhang, and went to the Bailinan Road area to check pedestrians. When passing the intersection of Kaixuan Road, they suddenly heard the sound of playing with a handgun from a thatched hut at the corner of the road. Listening carefully, it seemed that several people were talking inside, and the situation was very suspicious. They immediately worked with the police officers to push the door open and saw five people in short clothes gathered around a table playing cards. They were about to go forward to check, but one of them immediately got up and ran away. They first grabbed the other four and bravely chased after the fleeing man, finally capturing him. They also found a six-inch Browning handgun with live ammunition and five bullets in the stove. They took them all to the team for interrogation. According to the confession of the suspect, Wang Hailin, the handgun and bullets that were found while I was making buttons were picked up when I was pulling a rickshaw during the Shanghai war and kept at home. This matter is known to Lu San. Now that the weather is getting colder and the clothes are thin, Lu San told me that someone wanted to buy it, so I took the gun to Lu San's house and showed the gun to Lu San in his room. I didn't expect that detectives would come in a short while, so I ran to the bed and pretended to sleep to avoid suspicion, and I was arrested. I did not intend to commit robbery. According to the confession of Zhang Xiaosan, I live in Lu San's house. Wang Hailin brought this gun, and after showing it to Lu San, he returned the gun to Wang Hailin. I went out to buy things, but unexpectedly detectives came in to arrest me. Wang saw that the situation was not good, so he threw the gun in front of the stove to escape. However, I don't know what Wang Hailin used the gun for. According to the confessions of Wu Lisheng and Shi Qing (aka Shi Zhuqing), we were passing by Lu San's door and went inside. We saw children holding playing cards and playing, and we didn't know anything else. Captain Lu believed that hiding firearms violated the law and ordered that the suspects, Wang Hailin and others, as well as the handgun and bullets, be sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau for legal action yesterday morning.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Meeting Record of Copyright Holders and Publishers <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Copyright Holders and Publishers Association was established in Peiping in July of this year. It was initiated by Hu Shi, Hong Xuefan, Zhou Zuoren, Xie Bingxin, Zhang Xichen, Shi Zuocai, and others. Its purpose is to connect sentiments, eliminate pirated books in North China. Since its establishment, it has achieved good results. Yesterday, the general secretary of the association, Shi Zuocai, came to Shanghai from Peiping. The association's Shanghai office specially convened a meeting of the publishing industry to welcome him. Representatives from more than 30 publishers attended, including Zhang Xishan from Kaiming Bookstore, Hong Xuefan from Modern Bookstore, Cao Zhusan from Beixin Bookstore, Shen Songquan from Guanghua Bookstore, Zhang Yiqu from Children's Bookstore, Tang Zhejuan from Huatong Bookstore, Zhou Wenqing from Shenzhou Guoguang Society, and Wang Meng from Yadong Bookstore. First, Chairman Hong Xuefan reported on the purpose of the meeting. Then, Shi Zuocai reported that the Shuangyi Bookstore and Qingyun Bookstore piracy cases recently uncovered in Peiping have been strictly investigated by the Public Security Bureau, and the association is proceeding with legal procedures to warn against cunning elements. This was passed by the assembly. It was also proposed that Bao Yulin, the director of the Peiping Municipal Public Security Bureau, should assist the association in cracking down on piracy. Unless he takes it seriously, east and west market book stalls have not dared to sell for half a year. Our copyright and publishing circles have benefited greatly. How should we express our thanks? It was resolved by the assembly that cultural institutions and various groups should formally express their thanks to show their appreciation of his virtuous policies. Finally, the chairman discussed the case of revoking Qingyun Bookstore's membership, the case of sealing up the Beixin Bookstore, the association's operating expenses case, the monthly dues payment case, the case of amending the association's charter, and the case of Sanyou Bookstore joining the membership. All were passed by a majority vote. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>▲ Organizing a Support Association Against the North Salt Public Business Office</p>
<p>Yu Jihe and Lu Jianhou, representatives of the people from 21 counties in northern Anhui, came to Shanghai from Bengbu a few days ago to explain in detail the harm caused by the North Salt Public Business Office. The local Anhui Compatriot Association, according to the situation, sent telegrams to the National Government's Ministry of Finance, Salt Affairs Administration, Provincial Government, Commander-in-Chief Jiang, and Transportation Envoy Miao, requesting that the business office be abolished to benefit tax revenue and maintain people's food supply. Yesterday, the fellow villagers of the association held a public banquet for the two representatives. More than 30 people, including Shi Yinsheng, attended. Chang Fanhou was elected as chairman. Hong Zhenjiu gave a speech to express his condolences and the meaning of the banquet. Then, the two representatives reported on the progress of the case and the opposition of the people in Bengbu city and various counties, requesting the thorough support of overseas fellow villagers to achieve the goal of abolishing the office, relieving the people of their suffering, and expressing their gratitude. Following this, Wang Zhuru reported on the assistance of the compatriot association. Ma Zhuqing, Liao Ziying, Li Pengfei, Jiang Zhifu, Wang Cibin, Zhang Liangfu, and others expressed their opinions, all of whom believed that the problem was very serious as it concerned the people's food supply and the future interests of merchants, and that an organization should be formed and listed as a special case to continue the struggle. It was then decided to organize the "Anhui Shanghai Compatriot Support Association Against the North Salt Public Business Office," and Chang Fanhou, Liao Ziying, Li Pengfei, Cao Zhigong, Hong Zhenjiu, Wang Zhuru, Gu Chuansi, and others were appointed to be responsible for handling the matter, which was immediately announced to be established. The address of the association is temporarily set at Jinshuli, Lafayette Road. Yesterday, it has begun to work and issued a declaration, requesting the Anhui compatriot associations in Ping, Jin, Jing, Han, Su, Hang, Min, Yue, Yu, Lu, and other places, as well as compatriots at home and abroad, to strive for a consistent position. Also, Anqing already has a reply telegram, which roughly says, "The deleted telegram has been received. It has been forwarded to Transportation Envoy Miao for reference and handling. Special reply, Anhui Provincial Government Cleverly Printed."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry, which said, "It has been found that the native cloth exhibitions held in Wujin, Shanghai, Nantong, and other counties this time have achieved remarkable results. Now that the national crisis has not ended and the people are competing for luxury, it is not enough to talk about saving the country without vigorously advocating thrift and enriching people's livelihoods. In order to promote domestic products and enrich the rural economy, the department has planned to organize a provincial native cloth roving exhibition. It is stipulated that the native cloth products sent by various counties should be gathered and exhibited in the provincial capital first, and then transported to the counties for roving exhibitions in turn, so as to learn from each other and improve. Three kinds of regulations and two kinds of forms have been formulated and submitted to the provincial government for record. It has been found that the county belongs to the cloth-producing area. In addition to separate orders, the regulations and forms of the provincial native cloth roving exhibition are hereby sent for compliance." The county government immediately transferred the order to the Zhuanqiao Agricultural Education Center and the Minhang and other three chambers of commerce for compliance.</p>

<p>Xiao Feng, the abbot of Xiaolingshan Temple outside the Dananmen, had only been at the temple for a short time when he realized that there were more than 20 incense holders in the temple who were very powerful. Among them, Zhao Lingzi, Lu Guicai, Zhou Guilin, Sun Changhe, and other seven people had been invited by the previous abbot Ti Kong, so the incense holders were more powerful than the monks. Now that Xiao Feng was the abbot, they secretly discussed driving Xiao Feng out, so they destroyed the meditation room. Xiao Feng reported to the Third Section of the First District, and they were all detained and sent to the local court. Xiao Feng also claimed that the incense holders had premeditated murder. The prosecutor then ordered the incense holders to be taken into custody pending investigation and handling.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>After reading a news item in your newspaper on the 17th about a fire on Ningbo Road in the French Concession, it mentioned that the fire started at No. 203, which is not true. The house where the fire occurred was at No. 205. No. 203 is where I live, and it is not a brothel. I am afraid that outsiders will not be aware of this, and the rumors will be untrue. I am writing to you to request that you publish this letter.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Ever since the September 18th Incident, the act of hanging up the banner of national salvation while secretly engaging in seedling raising has been played out many times behind the scenes. Recently, a young man surnamed Guo on the Xi'an ship traveling between Guangzhou and Hong Kong also tried this trick, but was unfortunately seen through and ultimately failed, which shows that the ancient saying "The more one tries to deceive, the more clumsy one becomes" is indeed of considerable value.</p>
<p>In early October, during the process of the Xi'an ship sailing from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, a young man surnamed Guo, who lived in room number 10 of the Western restaurant, displayed a kind of painful and dejected attitude, stepping over the ship's railing to seek a place to return to in the vast sea. The crew's rescue was quick, and he was not able to fall into the water. After various consolations from the crowd, Mr. Guo reluctantly returned to his room.</p>
<p>The rescued Mr. Guo deeply regretted not being able to die. Under the surveillance of his fellow passengers, he was also found to be hanging himself with a rope in his room. After the crowd took away the rope, Mr. Guo was still unable to die. The crowd was unable to guard against everything, and had no choice but to tie his hands and feet to prevent him from seeking death a third time.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Guo's statement: He is a student from Yunnan who was heartbroken by the fall of Dong Province and traveled a long distance to join the army, determined to fight the invaders to the death. He once served as a secretary for the volunteer army. Because our army was defeated under the enemy's air raids, he escaped from the tiger's mouth and drifted here, and he was so heartbroken by the national crisis that he would rather die.</p>
<p>After being passed on among the fellow passengers, it aroused a very warm sympathy from the crowd, and everyone wanted to contribute as much as they could to rescue this enthusiastic patriotic young man. However, one female passenger reported to the crowd that she had witnessed Mr. Guo performing the same act on the Zhongxing ship sailing from Macau to Hong Kong. Fellow passengers contributed as much as they could and gave him more than 40 yuan before he stopped seeking death. Today's action is just "following the example" and "doing the same thing again." After this report, Mr. Guo's seedling raising trick was declared a failure.</p>
<p>Seedling raising! Seedling raising! You have so many ways to cheat, why bother hanging up this banner of national salvation and affecting the genuine national salvation work of patriotic youth? Seedling raising! Seedling raising! I advise you not to hang up this banner in the future.</p>

<p>｜Tragedy in the Countryside｜</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the times is moving forward relentlessly, and at the same time, it is sowing bad seeds in big cities and small villages. What I need to say now is about a fact in the countryside of nearby Wuxing County, which is indeed too tragic!</p>
<p>It should be said at the beginning that the protagonist of this tragedy - is really a supporting role. Generally, it is always the lower-class people, but sometimes there may be exceptions. What I know is that in the past, it was the local tyrants and evil gentry who dominated the locality in every village. Although the old tyrants and evil gentry have disappeared in form and shadow, the new tyrants and evil gentry, like bamboo shoots after rain, are constantly emerging, and at the same time, they are rampant with their tricks. The new tyrants and evil gentry, of course, have their minions like the old tyrants and evil gentry. These minions are the local hooligans. They are already doing all kinds of evil on weekdays, as long as they have money. Now that they have taken up the position of minions of the new tyrants and evil gentry, they are naturally even more eager to show their diligence.</p>
<p>The minions often pay attention to whether the lower-class people under their control have the opportunity to be blackmailed. For example, a strong man has just died in the ×× family, and there is only an old mother and wife in the house of the deceased. This is a good opportunity for the minions to arrive, and it can also be said that the financial army of the new tyrants and evil gentry is coming!</p>
<p>In the new tyrants and evil gentry's pockets, there are many lower-class people who want to marry cheap spouses. He uses the minions to run several times, and this poor widow falls into the arms of a hungry tiger. The price of this cheap spouse given by the other party varies depending on the beauty or ugliness of the widow's appearance. Generally, the best is 200 yuan, and the worst is no more than 100 yuan.</p>
<p>If the new tyrant and evil gentry determines that it is 200 yuan, then the widow's mother-in-law will get at most 50 yuan. The rest of the round number goes to the new tyrant and evil gentry, and the odd number is of course for the minions to squander.</p>
<p>The name of this tragedy is the shocking: "Live Head Cutting" three words! Perhaps the same tragedy is happening elsewhere, but its naming is different!</p>

<p>— Gao Qian</p>
<p>｜Why Do Birds Know the Way?｜</p>
<p>Summer is gone, and every autumn, countless birds (such as swallows) fly from the north to the tropical countries in the south. This long-distance flight across the ocean is a very strange phenomenon. Because we humans must have skilled pilots to navigate, and we must also rely on nautical charts and compasses. Even with such thorough equipment, we sometimes make mistakes. As for birds, needless to say, they do not have so many instruments, and in the vast sea, there is nothing to eat, but they can fly thousands of miles. Isn't that the most bizarre thing? Of course, many birds die in the middle of the sea due to exhaustion, and the rest who reach their destination are also half-dead from hunger, but they can eventually reach their destination, which is always a strange thing.</p>
<p>How can birds recognize such a long journey? Biologists have not yet found a definite answer.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we can guess that this is what the old birds teach the young birds. If people teach them, they can remember. We can say that birds have an extremely strong memory for this.</p>
<p>In addition, birds may have a strange sense of direction. We know that some people have difficulty recognizing roads, and some people can remember a place clearly after only walking there once. Perhaps birds are far superior to humans in this respect. If you blindfold a bird and spin it around a few times, it may know which way it is facing. We humans, on the other hand, if we are blindfolded and spun a few times, we will not know which direction we have spun to.</p>

<p>— Zeng Guang</p>
<p>｜A Word From Pan Yuzhen｜</p>
<p>Among the skill classes in our country, there are not many that can amaze people with their performances, have a large number of talents, and are famous abroad. The skill class led by Pan Yuzhen, a Chinese skill master, is one of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan had great ambitions since he was a child. He learned skills from famous teachers and practiced hard for ten years, and his skills greatly improved. When he grew up, he took his two sisters, Yulan and Yurong, and traveled across the oceans to various countries around the world, specializing in promoting Chinese martial arts abroad. Wherever he went, thousands of people were mobilized, but Mr. Pan never took this for granted.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan's two sisters are outstanding in appearance. Under the guidance of their brother, their martial arts are also very famous. They performed in Europe and the United States a few years ago, and as weak women, they performed martial arts that strong men could not do. No wonder people in Europe and the United States were amazed.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan not only takes it as his duty to promote national skills, but also his patriotism is no less than others. He is deeply pained by foreigners who mock our people as the sick men of East Asia. He once said to others, "The strength of a country always depends on the physical strength of the people as the standard. If the people's physical strength is healthy, then the country will never be rich and strong. Now, the people of our country do not seek the art of fitness, and they are extremely weak, to the point of being dying and incurable, and foreign insults are becoming more and more urgent. If we want to save China today, we should make it our urgent task to strengthen our physique."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan's skill class returned to the motherland from abroad yesterday and arrived in Shanghai. Also coming with him was Ms. Ju Ji, who was born with a singing voice and is the pillar of the most famous "Ziegfeld Follies" in the United States. Ms. Ju is the first Chinese girl to join the group and become a singer. It is said that Mr. Pan and others will lead the entire cast of artists from Shanghai to Europe next month.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Traitor's Mirror <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— ·Nan· Gong</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the three eastern provinces have fallen entirely due to non-resistance. The people of the Northeast have suffered the trampling of the Japanese army. Those who have lost their minds and gone mad have become shameless, acting as accomplices of tigers, thinking that it is a shortcut to wealth and giving up the shame of slaves, serving the enemy. My friend Hutou, who wrote from Yuanning, was unable to bear the oppression of the Japanese, and wrote about the matter of a traitor. Hearing this, I was refreshed and quickly recorded it in this talk as a mirror for those who act as traitors.</p>
<p>Li, from Laizhou, Shandong, once served as a low-ranking officer in the Zhilu Army and was friendly with the traitor Jin Bogong. Jin is a member of the Banner people and is now serving as a bodyguard for Puyi in the puppet state. Li was overjoyed when he heard this and quickly packed his bags and went to the puppet state to see Jin and seek a job, thinking that since Jin was a bodyguard, he would see Puyi every morning and evening and it would not be difficult to get a position. He did not know that even Puyi, who was called the head of the state, did not have the power of an ordinary Japanese, let alone Jin? When Jin saw that Li had arrived, he recommended him to the puppet Ministry of Industry because he was unable to help. The minister was also surnamed Li, from Shandong. At that time, people were afraid of the devastation of the Japanese and were unwilling to be their puppets, and very few people went to be traitors. Seeing that Li had arrived, he treated him as a fellow villager and gave him the position of director. Li was overjoyed, thinking that he was climbing the ladder of success and would be rich and noble forever. Before a month had passed, the Japanese gradually revealed their hideous faces to the various ministries of the puppet state, wanting to seize real power. The Ministry of Industry was one of the ministries that they had to get in particular, because they had to seize all the mineral industries in the Northeast. They were also afraid that the international community would oppose them in the name of justice, so they did not dare to seize the position of minister immediately, but instead sought to replace all the directors with Japanese. Li was elated and completely unaware. One day, a Japanese named Tanaka visited Li and they had a pleasant conversation. Li wanted to make friends with the Japanese, so he would do his best to smile ingratiatingly when he saw them. Seeing Tanaka's visit, he thought it was an unusual honor and did his best to entertain him. Tanaka visited Li's residence every day and often boasted that he had a close relationship with Muto. Li was even more respectful. In less than half a month, one evening, Tanaka said to Li that he had been ordered by Muto to organize a plainclothes team and had become the commander-in-chief. He knew that Li was familiar with martial arts and hired him as the chief of staff, and he did not have to resign from his position as director. Li was overjoyed. Tanaka gave him two pistols and a symbol. Li accepted them without suspicion. From then on, Li boasted that he had gained the trust of the Japanese. A few days later, Tanaka said to Li, "I have recommended you to Muto. We will go to Shenyang to meet him tonight." Li did not think at all, dressed up, wore his gun, and went to Shenyang by car with Tanaka. When he arrived at Shenyang Station, Japanese soldiers came and questioned Li and searched his luggage. When they saw the pistol, they immediately handcuffed him and said that he was a spy for the guerrillas. At that time, Tanaka was standing by, saying nothing, waving his hand and ordering the soldiers to take Li away. In the evening, Li was interrogated at the police headquarters. He saw Tanaka whispering to the interrogator. Li cried for help, but the Japanese soldiers had already dragged him down the hall. With a loud bang, this traitor who dreamed of wealth and honor followed the ruthless bullets to the afterlife! It was all Tanaka's cunning plan. He killed Li with a pistol in order to seize the position of director. On the second day after Li went to Shenyang, the puppet Minister of Industry received an order from the Japanese, saying that Director Li was a guerrilla spy and had been executed, and Tanaka was appointed as the director. After the puppet minister saw the order, he knew the truth, but he did not dare to say anything.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Financial News: Gold Price Reaches a High of Eighteen Taels Last Week <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>｜Rising Momentum Accelerates Short Squeeze｜</p>
<p>Last week's bidding price for gold coincided with the swap period (ten sessions in January). The market trend was strong, although the initial state was mediocre, and trading in December was slow. As the swap approached, the price difference was only two or three taels. Subsequently, there was a rapid change, and a new high of over 760 taels was reached. Initially, the silver market was slightly different, and the exchange rate continued to rise, so the Shanghai market's sterling was tight. The December gold price opened high at 749.2 taels, an increase of 2.5 taels. There were also rumors that the United States opposed the extension of war debts, subsequently exceeding 50 taels. Furthermore, Reuters reported that India had a surplus of silver reserves and planned to sell them, which further strengthened the market. Later, the gold price advanced due to the contraction of the silver market and the frequent decline of the US dollar exchange rate. On Wednesday, it reached 755.8 taels, closing at 53.4 taels at noon. However, as the swap date approached, the market switched to January futures, opening at 747.5 taels (December 54 taels, a difference of 6.5 taels, indicating a premium for the long position). The price then briefly hovered around 47 taels. Since the market was closed on Wednesday, and the exchange rate fell again despite a stable silver market the next day, with the pound sterling firm and the US dollar strong, the gold price continued to rise, albeit slightly. On Friday, silver prices in the UK and the US diverged, and the exchange rate plummeted, resulting in a strong sterling and a brisk US dollar. Moreover, with vigorous buying from Guangbang, Hengxing, Yifeng, and various short sellers, it suddenly broke through the 60-tael mark. The morning market was therefore low, but at noon, news suddenly spread that the US budget deficit for next year would be excessive, potentially leading to a shift to the silver standard. This news caused a setback in confidence. In the afternoon, Hengyu replaced Hengxing to cover more than 4,000 short positions, reaching 62 taels. On Saturday, the rising trend slowed slightly. The pound sterling remained unchanged, and the US dollar fell slightly, but the exchange rate suddenly turned upward, opening low. Subsequently, there was not much prosperity or decline, and the price returned within 60 taels, closing at 58.7 taels. Taking into account the previous Saturday (plus the swap, estimated at about 6 taels), the increase was 18 taels, with a full-week review of 15 taels (the difference between the opening and closing prices was 11.2 taels). The January contract has risen for two weeks, totaling about 20 taels. As for the swap, it was pre-arranged at 3.4 or 3.5 taels on the 15th, and formal trading began the next day, estimated at around 5 taels. Subsequently, it was quoted above 7 taels, but the exchange traded at 6.5 taels, then around 6 taels. On Saturday, it was between 6.8 or 6.9 taels to 6.4 taels. However, Hengxing's short positions were still not fully covered, and the January positions were largely filled, almost breaking even, suggesting a potential shift to a long position. Dalianbang, Yifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Yuanheng, and other long positions took advantage of the momentum and began to exit their positions. Overseas silver markets contracted slightly, and the local exchange market saw parity between sterling and gold, with the US dollar quoted at a small 0.25 discount, while the internal market generally contracted by half a point (0.125 for sterling, 0.25 for the US dollar). Because exchange rate fluctuations were uneven, the trends diverged significantly. Chinese gold firms such as Zhonghua and Dalianbang/Guangbang all covered short positions. Because the bidding price of gold increased more and more powerfully, the hedging values increased, and the hedging price was initially pressed at 60-70 taels, then calculated within 60 taels, ultimately over 60 taels. Initially, exchange rose then dropped, ultimately rebounding. The total change was smaller than the prior week. The pound fell against the US dollar by 2.25, and the US dollar fell against the pound by 2.375. The high and low prices of silver prices and exchange rates are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday was another Sunday, a day when banks are closed and the market was quiet. The market price of foreign currency for silver was 7 mace, 1 fen, 1 li, 7 hao, 5 si in the morning session, and 7 mace, 1 fen, 1 li, 8 hao, 7 si, 5 hu in the afternoon session. As a result, it increased by 6 hao, 2 si, 5 hu compared to the previous afternoon. Silver dismantling was even weaker. Both the morning and afternoon markets opened at 2 fen, which was 2 fen smaller than the previous day.

<p>From Monday the 14th of this month to yesterday, the local financial community, based on the entire report, has fully accounted for no less than five to six million foreign dollars being shipped out. Among them, Dalian accounted for the most, with a huge 2.65 million. The Yangtze River area and Hankou accounted for over 1.5 million, Guangdong, Shantou, and Xiamen accounted for over 1.2 million, the mainland accounted for 400,000, Tianjin accounted for 200,000 to 300,000, and Ningbo accounted for 200,000. However, according to a telegram from Dalian yesterday, they want to purchase and ship a large number of Yuan Head silver coins, regardless of whether they are new or old, and are willing to pay a premium of over 1 li. If so, they can add more than 1 li to the premium price. Yesterday, some people on the market were trading with a premium of 1 li. It is expected that someone will approve the cash today (21st) and reload a large amount to Dalian and other ports.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Securities: 19th Customs Bonds Continue to Rise by Two Yuan <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>｜Other Bonds Also Increase by Varying Amounts of One Yuan and Several Jiao｜</p>
<p>｜Market Conditions Are Slightly Clear, with Transactions Reaching 29 Million｜</p>
<p>Over the past week (from November 14th to 19th), the market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Securities Exchange were extremely clear. The spot market saw only 100,220 yuan in transactions, with 20,000 yuan accounted for by old tickets of the 1986 Public Bonds, 13,000 to 14,000 yuan each for Abolishment and Salt Tax Bonds, and 7,000 to 8,000 yuan for other bonds. The futures market was also far inferior to the previous week. The market was characterized by stable prices and a calm atmosphere, no longer as lively as the previous week. An examination of the daily transaction situation reveals that Thursday was the most active, with approximately 7.2 million, and Friday was relatively clear, with over 3.1 million. The remaining days were between 4 and 5 million yuan. The total was 29.6 million, a decrease of over 20.4 million yuan compared to the previous week, including 2.47 million for the November Salt Tax Bonds, 3.95 million for the December Salt Tax Bonds, 2.435 million for the November Consolidated Tax Bonds, 3.04 million for the December Consolidated Tax Bonds, 2.16 million for the November 20th Customs Bonds, 2.185 million for the December 20th Customs Bonds, 1.555 million for the November 20th Rolled Bonds, 1.69 million for the December 20th Rolled Bonds, 1.64 million for the November Disbandment Bonds, 1.585 million for the December Disbandment Bonds, 1.29 million for the November 19th Customs Bonds, 955,000 for the December 19th Customs Bonds, 1.095 million for the November 19th Philanthropy Bonds, 955,000 for the December 19th Philanthropy Bonds, 1.33 million for the November Abolishment Bonds, 480,000 for the December Abolishment Bonds, and other bonds only opened for the November term, including 405,000 yuan for Customs Duties, 200,000 yuan for Restructuring 6% Bonds, 175,000 yuan for 1986 Public Bonds, and 5,000 yuan for Financial Bonds. An examination of the forward trading of various bonds shows that as the end of the month approaches, trading is quite active. In the past week, it has exceeded the recent trading. As for the trends of various bond prices in the past week, the domestic and international situation has been very calm, and there have been no new developments in the bond market environment. Although the buying interest in the market is still good, the major players are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The market is different from before. The rising momentum of bond prices seems to have come to an end in the previous week. Although the prices have generally continued to rise, the trend is moderate and far from the frequent major ups and downs of the previous week. An examination of the daily changes in the past week shows that Monday was the strongest, with gains of 7-8 jiao to one yuan or several jiao. The buying interest was also the strongest. Tuesday saw a slight reaction, around half a yuan. The daily gains were steady between Wednesday and Thursday, but the fluctuations were minimal, only two or three jiao to half a yuan each day. Friday saw a slight contraction, and Saturday turned upward again. The stable situation remained unchanged from before. Although market trading was not quiet in the past week, the approaching end of the month led to an increase in swap transactions, and the supply and demand situation was balanced. As a result, compared to the previous week, only the 19th Philanthropy futures continued to rise by two yuan, while most other futures rose by one yuan to one yuan and five or six jiao. Only the Restructuring 6% and Financial Bonds fell slightly. Judging from the bond market situation, it seems optimistic. However, in the near term, as the settlement approaches, it is feared that the market will remain stable and not experience major ups and downs. A statistical table of the high and low prices and fluctuations of various bonds in the past week is listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>｜People give up, demand falls, sales plummet｜</p>
<p>Over the past week, the cotton yarn market has continued to decline, with each day seeming worse than the last. Due to the poor environment, there has been a need for stagnation. All sectors have no hope of development. The Sichuan war has not ended, the financial situation is urgent, and as a result, commercial depression is unbearable. Inquiries reveal that daily transactions in the spot yarn market have only been three or four hundred to two or three hundred bales. Under these circumstances, how can the market be sustained? Therefore, although the Yong'an Factory is struggling to maintain a long position, the trend is such that the decline is difficult to reverse. As for the overseas cotton industry, it is also in a state of fatigue and sluggishness, so most speculators are leaning towards the short side. The monthly price broke through the 40-tael mark, reaching a low of 39.3 taels. Inquiries reveal that the lowest price in mid-June of this year was 138.4 taels, a difference of only 9 qian. Most targets are looking for a new low below the price of 38.4 taels. In short, judging from the general trend, the situation is extremely pessimistic. Inquiries reveal that the total amount of cotton yarn purchased by various sectors throughout the week was 5,358 bales, of which 25 bales were goods opened by the Shenxin Factory, all of which were accepted by speculators. The spot price of opened yarn has fallen by about 2 taels. The bidding price of yarn in the near month has fallen by 2.4 qian compared to the previous week, and the far month has fallen by 9 qian to 1.5 taels. The total turnover for the week was 159,300 bales. The purchase amount of each sector is listed below:</p>

<p>｜Inversely Proportional to the Yarn Market｜</p>
<p>Spot Market Demand Also Good</p>
<p>Over the past week, although the cotton market has softened in appearance, it has actually been exceptionally strong. However, the situation in the US cotton market is also one of consolidation. Although some manufacturers have been selling large quantities of standard cotton, the pressure has been heavy. However, the delivery deadline for this month is approaching, and the supply from various sources remains scarce. Moreover, the prices in various producing areas are difficult to loosen. Given the situation in various places, it is more cost-effective to buy in the futures market to offset short positions. Therefore, purchases were made on [date] of this month to cover short positions, and the market rose, in inverse proportion to the yarn market. The spot cotton business in the market is still good. The cotton market is more expensive than the yarn market, but the overseas cotton industry is still in a slump. The future of the cotton market is uncertain. The source of cotton is calculated as 3,803 bales of Yao cotton and 8,333 bales of cotton. The total turnover of standard cotton for the week was 310,600 bales. The prices for each month are near month, up 4.7 qian from the previous week, and far month, up 2.3 qian. US cotton fell by 30 points compared to the previous week. The amount of spot cotton purchased by various manufacturers is listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Name Quantity</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 31.25-30.30 1,400 pieces Spot delivery to factory</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially weakened due to Southern selling and the need to settle many positions, but later rebounded due to some short covering. Futures fell by 9 to 11 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. UK cotton futures fell by 7 points, and spot prices fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 3 points. Indian cotton was closed. Original telegram, left (19th telegram).</p>

<p>▲Yesterday, the supply from various sectors in Southern Shanghai was not plentiful, only reaching about ten shops. Sales in urban and rural markets were more active. The prices of foreign Dujian were rising by 3 jiao. The Sutong sector and Dangxi Beigeng were collectively raising prices by 1-2 jiao. Bo Dao, Feilai Feng, was holding tightly.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, over thirty shops arrived in Xinzha's Western Road. Zhongguan Bai Geng was slightly stocked by storehouses, and prices increased by 2 jiao. Early and late rice, and fresh Beigeng, were both available for sale and purchase. The situation continued to be strong. The Lu Bu sharp township's interest moved slightly, and prices increased by about 1 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Dried Seafood: Dried Longan Prices Rise <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of Shi Ma dried round meat has risen, arrivals have been extremely scarce. It is heard that the recent arrivals at various shops have been less than ten boxes. Therefore, while the dried round meat from other areas is falling, the dried round meat from Ma is maintaining a strong position. Yesterday, it was heard that some goods were being opened for sale, rising by about 2 [units]. Some cargo owners even want to raise the price to 43 taels before they are willing to sell, but it is difficult to achieve this in Shanghai at once.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Metals: Lead Prices Surge Again <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, lead prices surged again. The reason for this is that private telegrams from overseas are frequently being sent, so the local confidence is good. Therefore, the standard price has skyrocketed, estimated to reach 12 taels and 5 qian per dan. Transactions by customers and factories have therefore suddenly increased. It is heard that the amount opened for sale has reached 600-700 dan. However, local reserves are still low, and the amount of Hunan native lead is also limited. Therefore, the price trend is likely to rise more than fall in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a fellow villager came to see me. He was already over fifty years old, so I had no choice but to entertain him. He talked incessantly, starting with a major robbery that had occurred in the home of a certain surname in the east village, then about the son of a cousin in the west village who, at twenty-one years old, still couldn't walk, and finally about the difficulties of the seven daily necessities these days.</p>
<p>He said that when he was young, the price of rice was measured in foreign sacks (i.e., two dollars per picul), and all kinds of goods were very cheap, so life was exceptionally good. Compared to the current cost of living, it had increased about tenfold. Some things were certainly not as bad, but others were even worse. When he was a child, a haircut cost only sixteen cash, or at most twenty cash, but now a haircut costs twenty or thirty cents. He had heard that some cost seventy or eighty cents, or even a dollar. He asked how many times the price had increased. Therefore, life now is truly difficult.</p>
<p>I said that villagers like him were alright, and as the saying goes, "A city dweller is impoverished by a drop of soy sauce, while a villager is impoverished by an iron crutch." He said that was exactly the point, that the villagers were left with no means of survival. The prices of all goods had increased tenfold or more, while the price of rice was getting worse and worse, almost to the point of being worthless. Who would want to farm then? He had heard that things were already like this in Hunan and other places, where each picul of rice was only selling for two dollars and forty cents. He asked how such a life could be considered livable.</p>
<p>I asked him why the price of rice was so high. He said that he didn't know, but he had heard people say that this year was originally a year of abundance everywhere, but the heavy taxes levied everywhere made it impossible for rice to circulate. In particular, some knowledgeable people had borrowed a large amount of American wheat to bring in. He had heard that the first batch had already arrived, and there were second and third batches coming. He asked if the price of rice could still rise.</p>
<p>I laughed and said to him that he truly didn't know his blessings. It was a blessing for him, but he was worried. The people of our country were inherently blessed. They didn't have to do anything or move at all, and everything would be sent to them to enjoy. I asked if there was anything among the clothes, utensils, etc., that people in our country had to make themselves. We only had to take out money, and there was nothing we couldn't get. Even guns and cannons could be bought from other countries and used to kill each other. Our country was originally founded on agriculture, and it was the villagers who suffered the most. They had not yet received a proper amount of happiness. Now that batches of grain were coming in, they could eat without plowing and wear clothes without weaving. This was their blessing. Did they even know it?</p>
<p>The villager realized that there was no point in talking to me, so he took his leave. I also made a note of this for the sake of providing talking points.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Method of Manufacturing Calcium Carbide <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Rong</p>
<p>When evening comes, one sees the calcium carbide lamps on package cars and free cars, which are brightly delightful. However, they are imported goods and are very expensive, not worthwhile. Now, the raw materials for calcium carbide and the manufacturing procedure are written below for the sake of imitation by the countrymen in order to avoid the outflow of profit rights.</p>
<p>(1) Raw Materials: The raw materials needed for manufacturing calcium carbide are quicklime (i.e., calcium oxide, also known as calcium oxide) and anthracite coal. The quicklime must be fresh and not contain moisture, because if it contains too much moisture, it will generate excessive heat and turn into slaked lime. Slaked lime is not a suitable raw material for manufacturing calcium carbide. Anthracite coal should also be selected for its purity and quality. After mixing the raw materials, it is best to manufacture them directly. If the mixture is placed in a humid place, the amount should be reduced. Care should be taken during manufacturing.</p>
<p>(2) Manufacturing Method: The manufacturing method is divided into grinding, mixing, drying, calcination, and condensation. The processes are described in order below.</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>A. Grinding: The selected raw materials are separately put into a grinding machine (or a stone mortar can be used instead, as long as the purpose of grinding is achieved). Grind into extremely fine powder and place in another container. Then, sift through a fine silk sieve to remove impurities (such as sand, stones, and soil). After the impurities are sifted out, they can be mixed.</p>
<p>B. Mixing: Mixing involves mixing quicklime and anthracite coal. The amount to be mixed depends on the composition of the raw materials. Approximately 28 parts of quicklime powder and 18 parts of anthracite coal powder are used. After mixing, stir with a rod until the mixture is thoroughly uniform, then dry it.</p>
<p>C. Drying: Spread the raw materials evenly on a white cloth and dry in the sun. If artificial drying is used, the room temperature should be around 80 degrees.</p>
<p>D. Calcination: Calcination involves placing the dried raw materials in an electric furnace and gradually calcining them. When calcined to white heat, they emit calcium oxide gas. The calcium carbide obtained in this way does not yield good results, so condensation is performed again.</p>
<p>E. Condensation: After calcination is complete, the calcium carbide is poured out and transferred to a cooling tank (the cooling tank should be made of iron, shaped like a common household clothing box. The inside of the tank should be smooth, and a little oil should be dripped into the tank and wiped clean with a dry cloth to prevent corrosion). Allow it to condense. If you want to make it into a square or round shape, you must pour it into an iron mold (the mold must be wiped clean) to wait for condensation, and then the calcium carbide is formed.</p>
<p>(Note) Calcium carbide should be wrapped in cloth (or thick paper can be used instead) and placed in a desiccant for long-term storage. Take it out when using it.</p>

<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>Since the Songkou Fort has been closed to visitors, those who come to the Songhu Road to remember the battles are filled with a sense of vicissitudes. On the morning of the ninth, I, along with two friends, Lin and Zhou, made a trip to remember the past battles. I will record the scenery along the way as follows:</p>
<p>When the train passed the Tiantong'an Station, Japanese soldiers with guns and equipment were patrolling at the end of North Sichuan Road. Their arrogant attitude caused those who witnessed it in the same car to be filled with anger. As the car passed Zhabei, a scene of scorched earth moved them. Alas! The people's morale is like this, but what about the weakness of those in power?</p>
<p>Before long, we arrived in front of the embankment of the Fort Command, where we saw a wooden sign with the words "By Order, No Visitors Allowed - Fort Management Office." The embankment was also cut off to prevent visitors, and a policeman was stationed there to guard it, which was very careful. We went around to the left side of the fort, but were blocked by barbed wire. Just as we were feeling frustrated, we suddenly saw a canvas shoe worn by a soldier, sinking into the roadside for about an inch. We couldn't help but sigh repeatedly. We secretly speculated that the owner of the shoe might have sacrificed to defend the territory, and left the shoe behind to warn future generations. However, in the present day, things have changed, and few people ask about it. Isn't it painful!</p>
<p>The platforms of stations such as Fort Taiwan are all riddled with bullets, so the tops of the platforms are like beehives, and many of the cement columns are broken in the middle. They have not been repaired to this day, and the desolate scene fills one with endless sadness! As the car passed various places, we saw that the houses of the people that had been bombed had all become open-air houses, with only the surrounding walls remaining and no roofs. How miserable! How painful! However, even after suffering such a great disaster at the hands of the tyrannical Japanese, there are still those who are willing to be traitors and merchants. It is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Ten Commandments for Traveling <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huo</p>
<p>(1) If you have not been to a place and need to ask for directions, you can inquire at old shops or from older people. Because they have lived there for a long time, they are naturally familiar with the geography. When inquiring, you must be sincere and polite, and not arrogant or rude. Otherwise, you will be tricked, and others will point you in all directions, causing you to walk around aimlessly, never reaching your destination.</p>
<p>(2) When taking a tram, if you have important items, you can put them in the inside pocket on your left side, put your left hand down to press on them, and use your right hand to hold onto the ring. Be calm. If someone you don't know strikes up a conversation with you, don't respond to them. Otherwise, you will be distracted and forget your things, and they will end up in their pockets.</p>
<p>(3) If you hear gunfire on the street, it is best to hide in a nearby shop. Do not panic and run around frantically. The police will think you are a thief, and you may be hit by a stray bullet.</p>
<p>(4) If you encounter a search on the street, you must raise both hands high and allow them to search you. The most important thing to avoid is putting your hands in your pockets. Do not think that you have money on you and quickly reach into your pocket to hold it tight. If the police see this, they will mistakenly think you are holding a gun, and a dangerous situation may occur.</p>
<p>(5) If you see someone drop a leather item or package on the street, do not be greedy and pick it up. Otherwise, someone will testify against you and extort money, saying that you stole it. If you look inside the leather item and see that it is full of paper, they will extort ten or eight dollars from you.</p>
<p>(6) If you have three rickshaws full of things and you can only sit in one yourself, then it is not easy to take care of the other two. You can write down the registration numbers of the other two rickshaws. If something unexpected happens, you can report it to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>(7) If you are holding something in your hands, do not look at the items displayed in shop windows. If you are absorbed in looking at something, it will be an opportunity for petty thieves to strike.</p>
<p>(8) The goods hawked on the street may seem very cheap, but once you buy them and use them, they will have defects. Therefore, no matter how cheap something is, it is best not to buy it, so as not to be deceived.</p>
<p>(9) Rickshaw parking areas are often located on small roads and open spaces. If you come out of a major company or movie theater, you should be willing to walk a few more steps to a small road to hire one. The price will be fair. Otherwise, you will be ripped off.</p>
<p>(10) If you are returning from a movie theater or amusement park at 12 o'clock at night and passing through deserted roads, it is better to call for a rickshaw or take a longer route through lively areas, because at that time of night, there are very few pedestrians. If you encounter robbers, you will be threatened.</p>
<h3 id="e181">In the Tram <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Yesterday, when I stepped onto a tram on Route 1, I felt truly fortunate, because I had never ridden on such a spacious tram before. In the large carriage, there were only three people in total, including myself. Therefore, I boldly relaxed my joints and sat on the chair, able to put on the airs of riding in a private car. At this time, I could pay attention to the conversation of the other two, because I had a free mind.</p>
<p>Their conversation had been going on for a long time, but the burly, great gentleman wearing a robe of patterned silk was very excited. He said to the short man with a mustache that could almost be counted below his nose:</p>
<p>"Ah! My happy days are completely over!"</p>
<p>I could tell that this was a Sichuan accent. The other party continued, saying:</p>
<p>"But you don't have to be pessimistic. Maybe you will have good luck later. Who knows what will happen in the future?"</p>
<p>A flattering smile was offered before the big man's eyes, but the big man did not seem to pay attention, perhaps he was still deep in his own sighs. Soon, he said again:</p>
<p>"From the age of eighteen until eight years ago, I never left my post. I had food to eat and things to use. I certainly had some good days, but these past eight years have been impossible. Ah!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, the so-called noble people suffer a lot! Haha! But I think you must have saved up a lot of money, right?"</p>
<p>"Money? Don't even mention it. If I had been willing to make money back then, needless to say, I would have had hundreds of thousands by now. But at that time, I always followed my father's words, 'A civil official does not love money, a military official is not afraid of death.' Even if the money was right in front of my eyes, I was not willing to take it, so I am still penniless."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. If all the military officers in China were like you, that would be great. But you should have saved some money for retirement, sir, do you agree? May I ask, I think you must still have tens of thousands of dollars in savings, right?"</p>
<p>"Hmph, I still have some money for pocket money, otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to do nothing for the past eight years. What would I have used?"</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, oh! Yes, yes. As long as you can get by, that's enough."</p>
<p>"But how can this little bit of money be enough? Although there are not many people, it costs money to maintain two mansions, one large and one small, in Shanghai."</p>
<p>When I heard this, I immediately imagined his power when he was in office, and the happiness of having a house full of wives and concubines. But according to him, this was still a time of bad luck. Otherwise, coming out for a walk would not have required taking the tram, and he would at least be in an Austin.</p>
<p>At this time, I saw that the man with the small mustache took out a rubber-tipped cigarette and offered it to the man in the patterned silk robe, and respectfully struck a match for him. This made me even more interested. Later, the man with the small mustache said again:</p>
<p>"I heard that Division Commander Liu is going to rely on you again."</p>
<p>"That's just him joking with me. Do you think I would take on a nominal advisor role? You have to know that if you want to be an official, you must have troops. With an army, everything is easy to say. Without military power, it's better not to do it. But is Division Commander Liu willing to let me command troops? He knows he can't control me, so he's giving me a useless title to collect a salary."</p>
<p>"But since Division Commander Liu treats you so well, I think you should condescend a little."</p>
<p>"I can't do that. When I was a regimental commander, he was just a regimental commander. Now he wants me to condescend to him? That's a joke."</p>
<p>"That's true, but if you go, it would be a great help to me, right? Surely you wouldn't be unwilling to get me a small job, sir? Hahaha!"</p>
<p>They both laughed unnaturally.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had arrived at my stop, so I had to get off. I don't know what happened after that.</p>
<p>My heart felt heavy. I thought that these two were both talents from Sichuan. Perhaps it was because Sichuan's mountains and rivers were so spiritual that so many talents came out, which is why there are so many endless tragedies of bloodshed today.</p>
<h3 id="e182">A Terrifying Night <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yichen</p>
<p>About two months ago, a family moved into the house across from my window. The female homeowner was a beautiful and fashionable young lady. Her husband, although not riding a jade-bridled horse or eating carp from a golden plate, seemed to have some wealth in my eyes. An exquisite Austin and a beautiful wife had long aroused my jealousy and envy, so I had to sigh at their happiness!</p>
<p>However, I paid such attention to them because their movements seemed a bit mysterious. Yes! Returning home at two o'clock in the middle of the night and going out at three or four o'clock in the afternoon couldn't help but arouse suspicion, could it?</p>
<p>A half-moon hung in the sky, and sparse stars dotted the sky, dancing in an instant. Apart from the barking of dogs in the distance, there was no other sound. It was a gentle and beautiful night, but the incident also occurred on this night, this gentle and beautiful night.</p>
<p>Normally, I would sleep soundly until dawn, but today was different. I tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep. Suddenly, a horn broke the silence, shaking my eardrums. "Yes! Since I can't sleep, why not get up and take a look at that beauty!" Before I had finished thinking this, my body had involuntarily wandered to the window!</p>
<p>Although I had sometimes seen them come back, there was an additional young man in a suit today! No! Maybe he comes often, because I haven't gotten up to peek these past few nights, so this time I'm even more suspicious. I leaned on the window sill and watched them open the door, close the door, go to the parlor, go upstairs...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pink curtains blocked my view, but I couldn't block my hearing. Laughter, singing, and talking constantly rippled over. I stared blankly at the shadows of the people reflected from behind the curtains. The clock chimed! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! It had already struck four!</p>
<p>Ah! Something's not right. Half an hour later, their movements were a little off. Why were the dark shadows moving back and forth so busily? Ah! Isn't that a knife in the shadow's hand? Alas! What did he fall over! ... Then there was a sound of overturned bowls, tables, and chairs.</p>
<p>"Ooh..." The man in the suit and the young lady grabbed a package and hurriedly rushed downstairs, opened the car, and left!</p>
<p>Shivers, fear, and dread, layer upon layer of hot blood rushed to my heart. "Sleep Demons" had long flown to the ninth heaven. Before long, the sky was faintly bright, and a noisy sound filled the alley.</p>
<p>"Terrible! The young master... is dead... dead! Grandma! Where... where did they go! ...""I'm going to report it!" "The police are here? ... Ah! The big shots are here too!" "A body in a pool of blood... a knife...?"</p>
<p>I, who was across the window, was shaking even more violently, almost with my knees rubbing against the floor! "Jealousy! Lust! Greed!" kept swirling in my mind.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>The Soviet Film Company was founded in 1925, abbreviated as Sovkino (Cobknbo). In addition to having the exclusive right to produce Soviet films, it also has the exclusive right to export and import films in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The shareholders of the Soviet Film Company are the founders of the company, namely the People's Education Committee, the Industrial Economic Council, the Moscow Soviet, the Leningrad Soviet, and the Commercial Committee. The company is organized into a management committee of eleven people, and the chairman is the secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Five people are elected by the general meeting of shareholders to form a supervisory committee, one as the supervisor of the Moscow studio, one as the supervisor of the Leningrad studio, one as the supervisor of the promotion department, and one as the supervisor of the technology department.</p>
<p>Sovkino invested 5 million rubles in film production in the 1930 fiscal year, with the content distributed as follows: 40 artistic films, 30 newsreels, and 50 educational popularization and other miscellaneous films.</p>
<p>In the two studios in Moscow and Leningrad, 45 directors are employed, mainly Eisenstein, Romm, Kuleshov, Tallett, Vakhatov, Popov, and Torauberke.</p>
<p>The internal equipment of the company is also very complete, with research institutes for testing, an actor's club that can accommodate 340 people, a small dining room that can accommodate 200 people, a large dining room that can accommodate 1,200 people, two libraries (one general and one for personal use), a physical training center that can accommodate 100 people, bathhouses, studios, warehouses, and a hotel that can accommodate 500 people and can be immediately converted into a theater. In addition, there are well-equipped buildings such as sick rooms, sanatoriums, and meeting places for Communist Party members and Young Pioneers. Because the Soviet film industry is operated by the state, the socialistization of film companies is an inevitable trend.</p>

<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Lionel Barrymore is an old, respected, and highly esteemed star. His collaborations with Garbo in Mata Hari, and with Elizabeth Allan in Yellow Ticket, are truly admirable. He is also one of the seven major protagonists in "Grand Hotel," which will be released in China soon. During the production of this film, Mrs. Little Fairbanks (Joan Crawford) was so impressed by his poise and sincerity that she temporarily "fainted on set." Barrymore's power is too great.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Hell's Headquarters <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Hunting films have been widely welcomed and praised in the past year, so the number of them produced in response to the trend is considerable. Today's new film showing at the New Light, Hell's Headquarters, is another film calling itself a hunting film.</p>
<p>Universal Pictures is the most active in producing this type of film, but this one cannot really be considered a masterpiece of Universal's beast films!</p>
<p>The actors are quite good: Jack Mulhall, though not robust enough, is still competent; the female lead, Barbara Weeks, gives a good performance; it is rare to see a female star filming amidst a group of wild beasts like this. Frank Mayo is commendable, especially in the scene where he is devoured by a lion.</p>
<p>The director is skillful in the way he shoots the scenes and their placement, and the scenery is also very good. Of course, this film has very few interior scenes; the magnificence of the exterior scenes adds much color to the film.</p>
<p>The plot is very convoluted, but unfortunately, many scenes that could have expressed emotion in the first half are omitted, and explained through dialogue. This inevitably makes it difficult for those with a limited grasp of English to fully understand, although the pronunciation is very clear.</p>
<p>Also, although the beast scenes are very exciting, there are too few of them, so that the audience cannot get the great terror and stimulation they hoped for!</p>
<p>It also clearly states that white people treat black slaves unequally and inhumanely. It also tells us about the effectiveness of conquering people with force versus conquering them with virtue.</p>
<p>An average comparison: This film is not as good as "Ingagi" and "Tarzan the Ape Man," but it is much better than "Little People of Africa" and "The Big Trail." It is entirely a love story, with a few African Congo landscapes and wild animals interspersed, forming the key to the ending. But the large quantity of ivory that is never seen is the center of the drama. Its strength lies in this; its weakness also lies in this.</p>

<p>— He</p>
<p>During the filming of a wild scene in Hell's Headquarters, Barbara Weeks was injured by an enraged leopard.</p>
<p>This unfortunate incident occurred after Barbara Weeks had just finished filming a scene with a trained leopard. But as she walked past the leopard after finishing the scene, the unreasonable beast suddenly leapt up, with its sharp claws outstretched, and pounced straight at Barbara Weeks. After Jack Mulhall's struggle, he finally managed to drive away the ferocious, angry leopard. However, the claw marks of thirteen bloody scratches were deeply engraved on Barbara Weeks' beautiful, fair legs!</p>
<p>Later, after Barbara Weeks rested in the hospital for several days, she continued filming the last and most exciting scenes with the leopard that had injured her!</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Question of Kisses in Domestic Films <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Zun</p>
<p>The thing that makes us feel most unsatisfied when we watch foreign films and domestic films is the depiction of kisses. In foreign films, we often see four hot lips pressed tightly together, while in domestic films, we hardly ever see such kisses; at most, they use various methods to indicate a kiss.</p>
<p>At the most intense moments of love, or when passion is at its peak, I dare say that, apart from a passionate, wild kiss, there is no other way on the screen to express it fully. Let us think about it, how tense are our heartstrings when we see a deep kiss in a foreign film! And how unsatisfied and anticlimactic do we feel when we see the scenery suddenly change or a back view used when a kiss is about to happen in a domestic film!</p>
<p>Here, the question of kisses may not be a big deal for male stars, but the problem lies with the female stars. Perhaps, Western and Chinese customs are different. In foreign countries, kissing is a common thing, so it is easy to perform a kiss on the screen. But in China, kissing is done in private, a privilege reserved for lovers. Therefore, the female stars' fragrant lips are unwilling to be offered to the fake lovers on the screen.</p>
<p>In fact, film is a great art, and the most important condition of art is to reflect life. Who in life does not kiss their lover? Since life is like this, then the lovers on the screen should also kiss each other heartily, regardless of whether they are real lovers in reality or completely unrelated.</p>
<p>Therefore, female stars should sacrifice for the sake of great art. Sacrificing a kiss for art is much more valuable than a kiss secretly given to a lover behind people's backs.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should not act in a passionate film if one is unwilling to perform it!!</p>

<p>— Bing</p>
<p>I was born on October 6, 1906, in Philadelphia. My father passed away when I was young. My stepfather, named Jones, was an electrician. He hoped from the time I was little that I would work in film. So my entry into the film industry was entirely due to his encouragement and guidance.</p>
<p>After I left school, I decided to look for work. One morning, I went to look for a job with a friend. Luckily, I found a job in a shoe store, earning $18 a week. But I soon became unemployed again. So I went back to school. At that time, my family moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles. I was very excited at this time, because I saw several big stars in that huge car, and I was extremely envious.</p>
<p>I first stepped onto a film set on a Christmas night, when I was working as an extra. But I was very enthusiastic and felt that life was not as monotonous as it was in school. After that, I joined Poverty Row Studios, taking on slightly more important roles. I gained valuable experience in these many ordinary films.</p>
<p>One day, Fox Studios was recruiting actresses. I applied. Unfortunately, the director chose a very experienced one. Perhaps the director was right, but at that time it was a huge blow to me.</p>
<p>Just when I was at Hal Roach Studios, I received a call from Fred Dating of Universal Studios, asking me to play an important leading role. After the success of this film, I went from being an extra to signing a contract with the company. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Dawn of Air Freight for Domestic Films: "A Fate in Tears and Laughter" Flies Between Shanghai and Hankou <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Lang</p>
<p>A film is shown simultaneously in two or more theaters in the same area. Newspapers carry large advertisements proclaiming "Simultaneous Premiere at Several Major Theaters," using this to create momentum and attract audiences. This is a relatively progressive business method that has become popular in the film industry recently. However, in reality, the key to achieving good results still depends on the quality of the film's content.</p>
<p>The multi-episode feature film "A Fate in Tears and Laughter" by Star Film Company is now being shown simultaneously in several major theaters, with Episodes One, Two, Three, and Four being released in quick succession. This is happening not only in Shanghai but also in theaters in Beijing, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places. For a time, demand exceeded supply, and even with many copies, there were still not enough to distribute. Therefore, when showing simultaneously in several theaters in one location, they came up with a method of sharing one copy among several theaters. They determined the times in advance. Theater A would start the screening on time. But as soon as one reel was finished, a designated person would immediately deliver it to Theaters B and C.</p>
<p>While "A Fate in Tears and Laughter" is being shown competitively in various locations, they have been using airmail planes to transport the film to and from Hankou in the past few days. It is said that the air freight rate for a one-way trip between Shanghai and Hankou is $2.90 per pound. Each film weighs approximately 60 pounds or more. The cost of shipping one time is calculated to be over 200 yuan. Although the sum is not small, it greatly shortens the distance and is extremely convenient. This "A Fate in Tears and Laughter" is the first time that a domestic film has been transported by airplane for business purposes. It will be a minor anecdote in film history.</p>

<p>— Zhen Hua</p>
<p>Zasu Pitts, nicknamed the "Female Chaplin of Hollywood," is currently an actress at Paramount Pictures. She has been with Paramount for many years, and her weekly salary is 3,000 gold dollars. However, she feels very dissatisfied. Recently, she suddenly prepared to join MGM, because she heard that MGM actress Marie Dressler is about to retire, so she is preparing to fill her vacancy. Perhaps she can get an even higher salary than 3,000 gold dollars.</p>

<p>— Ying</p>
<p>These days, there are many good films showing in Shanghai theaters. Yesterday, a reporter happened to visit two so-called second-class movie theaters. Unexpectedly, the compensation I received was beyond my initial expectations. I saw that the general audience, including myself, could be deeply moved. This also proves that these two films do have touching qualities.</p>
<p>The first is "The Phantom of the Opera," which is showing in Beijing. This film was originally a work by Lon Chaney from ten years ago, but it has recently been dubbed. However, when the Phantom appeared, a natural atmosphere of terror filled the entire theater. Many people, like the female character in the film, simultaneously cried out "Ah!" Because it was a night show, many timid people (mostly women) left their seats one after another. Isn't that strange?</p>
<p>The second is "Traces of the Orchid Valley," which is showing at the Central Theater. Of course, most of the people who go to the Central Theater are of the older (?) generation, and modern men and women rarely visit. So when "Traces of the Orchid Valley" first premiered at the New Light, there was no shortage of whispered conversations, but yesterday at the Central, the atmosphere was gloomy and miserable, and the sound of sobbing could be heard everywhere. This sound, of course, was not from the sound film. Even when leaving the theater, many people covered their eyes as they walked. If you look closely, seven or eight out of ten people have red tear streaks on their faces!</p>

<h3 id="e193">The Motivating Force of Expression <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabe</p>
<p>After practicing concentration a couple of times, you will feel that your breathing is subjected to a very strange pressure during practice. The higher the degree of concentration, the easier it is for you to feel your breathing. People who have never practiced various breathing exercises often feel short of breath, or even breathless.</p>
<p>This is the inevitable result of practicing expression. Working on a screen play is like working on a stage play. One hour of work often consumes several times more energy than other mental or physical work. This is because when we perform in the face of tense, ever-changing emotions, we expend too much energy, so we are very easily tired afterwards. Anyone who has filmed one or two expressive shots on a film set has experienced this unusually exhausting taste. People who are not physically sound or have problems with their respiratory organs have no connection with the camera, and that is the reason why.</p>
<p>Yes. Changes in emotions must be helped by deep breathing. Someone once asked me what the motivating force of expression is. I said that breathing is the motivating force of expression. No matter what expression you want to make, you must first adjust your respiratory system to exactly match the needs of that emotion in order to express it appropriately. Otherwise, no matter what expression you make, you will not be able to make it look exactly like the real thing. We see that the expressions in many domestic films are very naive and laughable, because people who have seized the status of stars through money, backing, relatives, changed love, and other improper means have never known that the central organ or motivating force of expression lies in breathing. In other words, the reason why many friends who are accustomed to watching imported films do not like to watch domestic films is because many stars have not yet known this "secret" of expression.</p>
