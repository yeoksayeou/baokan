<p>時評</p>
<h3>中大學潮平議</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>邇年以來。我國學潮。洶湧澎湃。愈演愈烈。國立學校。或經費無着。或負責無人。大都陷於混亂狀態。不久以前。北平各校以拒長與爭經費種種問題。掀起絶大之風波。迄今猶未解决。兹則全國最高學府中央大學。復以拒絶段敎次代理長校。終至行政院以明令解散聞。</p>
<p>此次中大學潮發生之根因。仍爲由於經費無着。故自朱家　氏去職。校長問題亦迄未解决。此次段氏奉命代理長校。到校接收。少數校生以其不合人選標準。且又與前次在行政院請願時汪精衛氏書面答覆之結果相反。遂羣起拒絶。段氏遂遭毆辱。釀成目前全體解散之慘象。夫以曾受高等敎育之學生。竟出之以極野蠻之手段。學校成爲演武之塲。此誠爲極可悲之現象。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人將以此次學潮之責任。盡委之於學生乎。是則不能。邇年來學潮之所以愈演愈烈。初非偶然。要當以外患之刺激。政治之混亂。生活之不安。實爲學潮之根因。吾人前已數數言之。政治而不澄清。則一切皆陷於不安定之狀態。無整飭之可言。固不僅敎育而已。青年血氣方剛。情感所激。舉動容有乖張之處。然而挽救之道。與其責之學生。母寗諸政治本身。抑且莘莘學子。處於目前内憂外患交相煎逼之情勢下。不能安心求學。抑已可悲。吾人復何忍更加以苛責乎。</p>
<p>至於中大此次學潮。依據事實之分析。則尤不能獨責學生。中大全國之最高學府也。以全國之最高學府。而最低限度之經費。亦積久拖欠。學校當局。索討無着。敎職員請願無着。學生一再呼籲亦無着。各種事業。無從進行。此復成何景象。夫以號稱地大物博之國家。而竟至無法維持一最高學府之經費。坐索立討。有苦市塲。使敎授不能安心於其所事。因而學生亦不能安心於其所學。此則政府所不能辭其咎者也。</p>
<p>次之邇年敎育之日益敗壞。最大根因。爲由於官儉主義之侵入。蓋毫無可疑。敎育爲專門事業。段氏現任敎育次長。如曰盡職。則處理部務已無餘暇。更何能兼攝中大校。務政府不覓妥人於敎育界。而必委之於現任官吏。則文何說。同時更據段氏呈報中有曰。『竊當鈞院第四十五次會議决議派職暫代中大校長時。職曾以中大爲國家最高學府。必須愼擇德望素孚。及富有敎育經騐之人。以爲校長。職自審不敢當此重任。經以再四堅辭。』是則段氏亦早已自審其不克當此重任。而向政府堅辭至瑞三至四矣。以自審不克當此重任之人。而政府必畀之以重任。强人以所難能。卒以釀成此次之不幸事件。是則政府不僅負中大。抑亦負段氏。猶記去冬政府委任桂崇基爲中大校長。亦曾引起一塲武劇。前轍未遠。今軌又覆。此又爲政府所不能辭其咎者也。</p>
<p>今一切之責任。都歸之於學生矣。學生已有多人被拘矣。最高學府亦已明今解散矣。爲整頓學風計。爲整頓敎育計。在政府或亦持之有理。獨是以極少數學生之舉動。竟不惜牲犧全國最高之學府。不惜牲犧全體二千餘學生之學業勒令學生三日内一律離校。且對於毫無關係之敎授。亦多數牽涉。自吾人視之似。未免失之過嚴。或且爲得不償失。</p>
<p>尤有進者。據汪院長日前演說。謂「某省省政府不許人民種烟賣烟。而他一人獨種獨賣。烟苗遍全省。都爲他一人所有。」又如張貞在漳橫肆騷擾。陳調元所部四十六師在台肥茶毒地方。更如陳濟棠攻瓊。政府如誠欲整飭紀網。樹立威信。則此種烟之某省。禍漳之張貞。禍皖之陳調元。陳濟棠之用兵。獨不應加以膺懲乎。於此種大問題則裝痴裝聾置不聞問。獨於中大之學生。則有若奮雷霆之震怒。解散學校。雷厲風行。毫不假惜是母乃爲重其所輕。而輕其所重。故吾人深盼政府體念中大締造之艱難。對此次風潮。善爲處置。尤深盼政府轉移其威權於政治之遠者大者。而勿操牛刀以割鷄豚。</p>

<h3>中委朱霽青昨招待新聞界</h3>
<p>報告東北義軍情形中委朱霽青、於昨日下午二時、假八仙橋青年會、招待本埠新聞界、報告東北義勇軍情形、到各報社記者三十餘人、據氏報告云、今天招待本埠新聞界諸君、辱承惠然肯來、感謝之餘、覺得不勝榮幸之至、同時想起了正在孤苦奮鬥和敵人肉搏的關外同胞、未免又覺得十二萬分的懸念、此次兄弟從關外回京、沿途均有新聞記者、殷殷埀問、足見新聞界諸君、對於東北的同胞、也是特别關切、現在要來向諸君報告的、</p>
<p>第一先簡單的說出關考察的一般情形、兄弟此次出關、往返費時、不足三個月、而所考察的地方、又限於遼河以西、且交通不便、更爲極大之障碍、所得的材料恐怕不能完善、但是兄弟生於東北、而且由兄弟派往各地工作的同志、也有報告、綜合起來或者不致有很大的誤謬、一·東北一般民衆的心理、東北淪陷、迄今已九閱月、一般人民、雖受盡種種的慘酷待遇、但其民族的意識、不但未消磨、而且激發的異常强烈、問有少數的漢奸、甘心爲虎作　、一般人民、日在渴望政府、早日收復東北、以求解放、兄弟在關外時、地方人民訴說種種的苦况、要吾轉逹中央和全國同胞、其不忘國家之心理可見矣、二·日軍之暴虐的行爲、舉例來說、（一）唆使韓人、侵佔土地、（二）剝奪自由、不准人民有言論的自由、固不待說、就是如有讀書閱報、被他發覺、立刻就槍斃、甚至他們有時不高興、對於行人也任意的捕殺、參加義勇軍的人、若被發覺了、則屠其全家、此外如火車站的檢查、婦女的侮辱、種種暴虐不及詳述、三·日軍的分佈狀態、目下在東三省的日軍、大約共有五六萬人、皆分佈於各鐵路綫及城市、他們不敢遠離十里外、入夜且多聚在一起、以防中國人之襲擊、實在是驚慌萬分、再者在東北的日軍、多無作戰的經騐、戰鬥力殊弱、士氣亦不振、四·一般日人的苦悶、日軍佔據東北、在吾固受極大的蹂躪、而一般日人、也受極大的損失、一切的事業、大都陷於停頓或凋敝的狀態、如就南满鐵路公司而言、從去年四月一日到今年三月三十一目的一年間、竟賠了三百四十餘萬元、這是該公司開辦以來二十餘年所未有的、所以一般日人、實際上甚感苦悶、據說、瀋陽日本商會會長、因爲事變以來、商業賠累、兒子又陣亡、憂悶的結果、竟爾變成瘋癲了、</p>
<p>第二就是關於東北武變民衆抗日的情形、武裝民衆就是世人所說的義勇軍、所以東北武裝民衆、就是東北義勇軍、但是在實際上、抗日的東北武裝民衆集圑、其名稱尙不一致、大體分别之、共有三種、（一）爲救國軍、（二）爲義勇軍（三）爲自衛軍、現在報紙上所登載東北義勇軍活動情形、是包括這三種的、至於馬占山丁超李杜等部、因爲那是正式軍隊、則又當别論了、關於東北抗日武裝民衆人數、兄弟可以說、遼吉黑三省、民間共有二百餘萬枝槍、而與遼寗毘連的熱河方面、爲數尤多、每村住户、有槍的約在三分之二、僅朝陽一縣、就有十四萬枝、遼西抗日、熱邊的民衆、出力殊不少、所以若是有子彈的接濟、東北有槍的民衆、都能起而抗日、其總數可在二百數十萬、目下隨時隨地動作的、大約有四十萬左右、但是作輟無常、聚散靡定、確實的統計、也狠難得、其有組織而常常動作的、約在二十萬至三十萬、此類武裝民衆的集圑、（有組織的）據兄弟在遼寗所調查的、其成分如下、（一）曾爲土匪者約百分之三十、（二）農民約百分之五十、（三）曾充軍人及警察者約百分之十五、（四）知識份子約百分之五、東北武裝民衆之兩大缺點、（一）子彈缺乏、（二）指揮不統一、第二點正在改善中、第一點問題狠爲嚴重、要請各方面設法援助、</p>
<p>第三來說、兄弟組織東北國民救國軍的經過、及國民救國軍槪况、一·經過、（一）動機、認爲非抵抗不能救亡、（二）名稱、因志在結合武裝民衆共同救國、故定名爲國民救國軍、（三）組織之用意、在聯合各方面、逐漸成爲一個組織、以集中力量、共同禦侮、（四）信條、（甲）抵抗暴日、（乙）否認僞國、（丙）保衛地方、（丁）扶植民治、軍事計劃、事關秘密、未便公聞發表二·槪况、加入組織的、遼寗約十萬人、吉黑約五萬人、其他正在聯絡或組織中、最後要來說的、日軍之佔據東北得的容易、固然出其意料之外、而統治的困難、也其出意料之外、日本前任外務大臣幣原、他曾說過、「吞中國如吞炸彈、」這話是對的、只須東北民衆能再接再厲的長期奮鬥、則日本在軍事·内政·外交·財政·社會上、都要一天比一天的困難、我們必有光復國土的那一天、就歷史上事實來講、在中國以往變更朝代、大多數是由民衆起來做的、在外國則法蘭西之未亡於普魯士·是因法國全國民衆組義勇軍起來抵抗的日本封鎖西伯利亞、結果失敗而撤退、也是由於蘇俄黨人、領導民衆、起來抵抗的、這都是很顯明的例子、我們所最要注意的、日本的大陸政策、不僅是要佔領東北、而是要滅亡全中國、東北一日不收回、中國就一日不安、收復東北的唯一希望、全在那三千萬同胞身上、而那三千萬同胞、能抵抗日寇、則全仗有二百餘萬的槍枝、但若無子彈的接濟、則縱有槍枝、亦屬無用、且恐漸漸被日人没收、居民亦將被壓迫而逃散、日軍打算、在青紗幛起以前撲滅東北的抗日民衆、目下實在最緊要的關頭、務望新聞界喚起民衆、督促中央、從速予以援助、收復東北、即所以保存全中國、中華民族前途的命運、實繫於此了、</p>

<h3>朱家對中大學潮發表談話</h3>
<p>朱敎部長因出席中英庚欵董事會議、昨晚夜車來滬、寓於滄洲飯店、發表關於此次中大學潮談話如下此次中大學潮、實爲吾國敎育界最不幸之事、政府爲整飭學風起見、不得已始有斷然的處置、其經過業經宣佈、惟本人主持敎育行政、目覩學潮發生於首都最高學府、校長橫被毆辱、心極不安、故當日卽在中政會及行政院會議席上提出辭職、嗣并正式遞呈請辭、惟在政府未任命繼任以前、本人自當繼續負責、至於事後一部份敎授及學生之表示、在學潮中亦爲應有之文字、惟報减一部份敎授舉行所謂敎授會議、對於本人、加以誣衊、不能略言事實眞相、其所指各點如下、（一）關於水災捐欵查該捐欵分九十十一三個月扣除、當時預定在三個月扣齊、一併掃數繳解賬災機關、惟中大經費、以江蘇敎育經費積欠過多、十一月間領到之欵、尙不足發九月份全薪、故會計組在發薪時、將水災捐作轉賬虚扣、并無現欵存在、并於發薪前以書面通知各敎授在案、迨十二月間發十月份薪時、本人已辭職離校、一部份敎授自動召集敎授會、并以該會名義干涉校務、以領到之欵、不足發給上月份全薪、亦將水災捐轉賬虚扣、至發十一月份薪時、予已正式解除名義、敎授會决定停扣水災捐、并將已扣應解之所得捐自動發還、故敎授會所謂「吞蝕水災捐」之事實如此、水災捐旣未被吞蝕、亦非予個人負責、敎授會似自忘其所爲也、</p>
<p>（二）關於發薪支配當時一部份敎職員因離職關係要求、援照先例提前發給欠薪、此時校務由法學院院長劉光華代行、并有敎授會議所派收支委員直接監理會計組事務、薪水放發、曾由該委員等同意、同時發薪册上、并經收支委員蓋章、有案可稽、責任所在、至爲明顯、</p>
<p>至謂本、前談話中「意指敎授操縱、　　敎授人　」一節、此種吹毛求疵之辭、更屬無稽、本人服務敎育十有餘年、素極尊重敎授地位、過去言行俱在、不欲多辯、以後各方關於中大學潮之言論、恕不更答矣、</p>

<p>依我看來，今天是兩個人合做一個先生。江營長的武藝高明極了；處處令我欽佩。當這帝國主義高壓的時代，這樣年青的好軍官爲什麽退職？我是有些不解。朱先生對於軍事是素來没有學過。但江江營長似乎是少不了他。江營長的武藝多半是眞本領但是也參了不少不少的武八股、當他們討論怎樣着手訓練的時候、江營長說了許多事體要學、朱先生則專點他的眞本領而撇開他的武八股、江營長長好一比是開了一個菜館，朱先生是爲我們點菜、寫菜單。魚翅，，燕窩，熊掌，猴腦，龍虎鬬一槪不要，所要的只是青菜，豆腐，，紅燒肉，蝶蝴麵，都是一些省錢好吃得飽的東西，江營長每提一一樣，朱先生老是問：『四小時後土匪就來，這可是必需今晚學的』</p>
<p>這樣除去糟糠提取精華　定出那四種緊急訓練。</p>
<p>還有一件事我不可以忘記叙述。鐵匠老李說：『我們發見土匪來的的时候，先向天空放一空槍，使土匪知難而退。若先放空槍，他還要還要來，那時開實槍擊他，他死也無怨。』這一點大家認爲很合人人道，一致贊成。因爲我們組織這個民圑，祇　自衛，决不願傷人人性命，自做好老。</p>
<p>朱先生也加了一個提議，說：『就是有敵人來，也當瞄準他的腿上上射擊。我們只要使他失去戰鬬力就算逹到自衛目的，不可定要致致人死命。我們要有不殺無辜的精神纔可以掌握民衆的武力。』這也是一致通過了。這個辦法是比較難行，因爲在黑夜裏戰鬬，是不易是不易瞄準。但是朱先生的主意正因爲黑夜不易瞄準就不要太家輕輕易放槍，以免誤傷自已的人。好，我們的這個古廟自衛圑不啻是一個古廟菩蕯圑，有趣！老實說，醉翁之意不在酒，打强盗不算算一回什麽事，保護小孩子撲滅帝國主義纔是我們眞正的目的咧</p>

<h3>糧食米市緊而復軟</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來船十五六號、城鄉店銷因洋米轉淡、人心看定、交易仍呆、常錫北粳又跌角許、早晚稻到貨不多、銷場微細、變陰元到銷二平、市亦定勢、　洋尖到頭日稀、因連日跌風過銳、惟棟頂貨稍動、致價平庸、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日西路來船、江陰　陽米爲最多、本街店胃呆弱、嘉善平湖早稻存貨尙豐、厚薄粳行情又削一角、形勢一蹶不振、埠洋尖存底均薄、市無上落、糯未到雖缺少、去胃絶無、市趨下游、河下斛脚約二千五六百擔之譜、</p>
<h3>本街暢辦洋米</h3>
<p>價續漲一角半　　昨日洋米市况、北帮辦胃停頓内地鄉莊略有問津、惟本街辦胃轉旺、辦去小絞近萬包、西貢一千包、人心極佳、行情立漲角半、但此批進户、實銷者祇占半數、其半數乃係浮户、一俟市價再漲、必須脫出、故如今明再有實銷旺辦、市價尙須上漲、否則暫可站定也、全日成交小絞一萬二千包、價九元九角至九元七角半、中次九元六角七分至九元五角半、西貢一千包、價十一元二角至十一元一角半、温州糙五百包、價九元二角、江西機元二百三十包、價十三元九角至十三元云、</p>
<h3>標粉徘徊中帶軟勢</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈盤旋俏疲互見之象、本月份成交甚少、買賣均呈觀望、遠期各月份、交易則頗旺暢、以内地帮鑒于各處又見水患、天時亦難期常晴、所以買氣甚暢、最高時曾較前月好一分左右不等、惟二盤以後、則又續軟、傳洋商方面、曾又抛與洋帮洋粉、送到天津、合價祇一兩七錢八分、如是競爭、申粉之銷場、當然大受打擊、故標準之難振、實覺莫可如何也、結果本月份較前日小二厘半、八九月份小五厘、十月至十二月份、各小二厘半云</p>
<h3>期麥穏定</h3>
<p>小麥做開六千五百包昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平穏之象、以洋麥報價雖小一角左右、惟一般空户、因各處又有水患之故、陸續暢出、一時頗覺買氣甚盛、市呈挺　、不過一部之無錫帮以現麥甚廉、始終較標準爲宜、仍繼有抛出、將來之結果、當看實際之去化也、結果本月份較前日大三分、八月份大一分、九月份不動、十月份大三分、十一月份大二分、現麥市况、仍趨平定、到源大旺、約在一萬餘包、銷祇半數、開橫涇麥二兩八錢四分、支塘麥二兩八錢二分至八錢、蓬萊麥二兩七錢八分至七錢、雙鳳麥二兩八錢二分至七錢七分、太倉麥二兩七錢二分、崑山麥二兩八錢、直塘麥二兩七錢半、白鶴港麥二兩七錢至六錢半、望仙橋麥二兩七錢二分至七錢、黃渡吳淞麥二兩七錢、安亭麥二兩六錢八分至六錢半、共開六千五百包、由福新華豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>糖市荷赤號開頗盛</h3>
<p>趨勢甚挺　　昨日糖市公會市場刻盤、交易殊靜、但人氣仍佳、荷糖二十四號、粗砂白成交價十四兩二錢、高貨十四兩二錢半、香港貨十四兩零五分、十四號生砂白十二兩、八九號荷赤十兩零二錢、市形頗堅、太古　進出見懈、ＣＷ嘜十五兩七錢半、ＤＹ嘜十五兩五錢半、ＨＸ嘜十五兩三錢、ＨＭ嘜十四兩九錢、ＰＸ嘜十兩二錢、Ｈ嘜十二兩四錢、交易零落、趨勢殊穏、號盤有禎祥開出香港貨糧砂白五百袋、價十四兩零五分、華新號售開八號荷赤二千袋、價十兩零一錢、粗砂白一千三百袋、價十四兩二錢、本廠水花青祥源售出三百餘袋、價十一兩三錢、行方進意殊濃、如數售通、頗爲俏秀、又祥源廠出品大袋水前開十五兩四錢、售出百餘袋、昨喊漲十六兩、一時尙少問津云、</p>
<h3>南北貨新海口枝二盤微好</h3>
<p>新海口枝二批貨已於前日運到、共計五百餘件、昨聞南北市各號已次第開通、價高至十二兩半、次至九兩二錢、比首盤微好、因價格廉宜、各方走塲尙屬活潑、第三批不日亦可告抵、開價當不致離譜也、</p>
<h3>新金針菜已到漢</h3>
<p>辦價爲廿一兩　　陳州新金針菜、昨據漢口電訊、首批貨現已到漢、價爲二十一兩、加上一切外費、劃申須合二十四兩許、如爲申帮辦入、不日卽可運申、初次獻新、售盤當不致離譜也、</p>
<h3>絲茶歙縣珍眉轉趨堅漲</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊之珍眉綠茶、英莊同孚錦隆怡和恊和等行、搜買仍不遺餘力、天祥福時洋行、亦復繼起開辦、局勢愈趨堅穏、其中歙縣珍眉、因存底枯薄、華茶商態度堅硬、市盤業已回漲四五兩、屯溪遂安等路貨、人心亦均一律向上、惟婺源西北兩路之工色珍眉、近日頭批業已到齊、保昌怡和等行、雖均探詢盤價、但華商鑒於屯溪歙縣珍眉暢銷、意態較前尤硬、新價頗難做開、</p>
<h3>疋頭川帮搜羅巧克丁</h3>
<p>夾色斜點巧克丁、前日川北帮突起搜羅、因之銷路大好、同益會市氣非常緊張、查法貨市存毋多、洋行方面到貨有待、因之售價好起數分、昨好華寗豐巧克丁躉批每碼已漲售至二兩九錢、其他順全隆列豐等牌爲三兩零五分、淡白色者更形暢銷俏俐云、</p>
<h3>夏令呢絨銷滯價賤</h3>
<p>呢絨市氣昨仍平定、各貨趨勢均軟、尤以夏令需銷之白　嘰白直貢·羽紗呢·黃斜紋·法蘭絨·巴勒呢·眫别取·白吉布告、更形疲弱、蓋買方需要停頓、致市銷呆滯、售價减賤、昨漢平白　嘰减售至三兩九錢、白直貢呢三兩五錢、好時三兩七錢半、永樂天祥白　嘰爲二兩七錢半、大路恒利絲光條羽紗呢售一兩六錢、華綸西裝羽紗呢二兩八錢二分半、</p>
<h3>五金新鉛絲跌價錢半</h3>
<p>新鉛絲新近東貨暗中活動、致英美諸貨均受打擊、交易長江一帶、因江水頻漲、多來信停辦福建閙共、山東河北諸省均以銀根緊急關係、减少買胃、所以市情甚軟、故標準回落二錢半、如十六號至二十號每擔估十二兩五錢、二十一號至二十五號售十八兩、查連日開出爲數甚寡、所以前途市况、仍抱悲觀也、</p>
<h3>美馬口鐵現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>二百磅美馬口鐵、新近到貨已屬有限、而各廠家需胃正値强健之期、故市貨呈　不敷求之象、目下標準九十磅每箱售十三兩、一百磅十五兩、二百磅卅一兩、一百八十磅二十八兩、聞連日銷去共有二千餘箱之多、</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>有一位德人呌做穆麟德，是駐高麗的德國副領事。穆麟德嫌副領事的差使太辛苦，就謀得中國江漢關關官的肥缺。穆麟德親口對吾說稅務的醜史。</p>
<p>中國人拿關卡的差使當做發財的捷徑，「扦子手」那樣的職務，大家趨之若鶩，甚至要做扦子手，而且要一天換一個。這班没有廉恥的人竟能一一辦到。其實這祇是中國人做官發財的秘訣的縮影。</p>
<p>中國人惟有做官可以發財，老百姓終是倒霉。做官發財的方法，變本加厲，層出不窮。而中國社會的卑鄙心理也都以做官發財爲名利。書生用功讀書，目的在名利，不過他還能用苦功，從考試去求功名。而卑鄙的小人則用其他　營的方法來逹到做官發財的目的。其追求的手段，好比水銀瀉地，無孔不入，只求做官，不顧廉恥，連用美人計也在所不惜。</p>
<p>中國人利慾薰心，實在無可諱言，然而外國人也竟能接受美人計。足見外國人的　慾，也未必弱於我們。能不受　慾所衝動者，恐怕祇有純潔的宗敎家。宗敎家見惡於世人者在此，見好於世人者亦在此。</p>
<h3>耒陽之漢代遺蹟</h3>
<p>— 天恨</p>
<p>湖南耒陽。爲漢置之縣。及元而改爲州。明復爲縣。清屬湖南衡州府。民初置衡陽道。耒陽屬焉。漢末龐士元（統）曾宰是邑。名乃大著。史稱士元陽人。司馬徽稱爲南州之士冠冕。先主使守耒陽。不治。魯肅曰。士元非百里才。使處治中别駕之任。始得展其驥足耳。先主召爲治中從事。演義於此。適與之相反。史稱不治。演義則載士元之任。好酒廢事。先主命。桓侯按問。孫乾隨。士元以半日盡了吏三月來一應訴訟錢糧積案。曲直分明。其民拜服。非不治也。故至今尙有兩遺蹟。曰鳳雛亭。曰石鑿馬槽。胥當時故物。亭雖屢修。乃就傾圯。石鑿馬槽即桓侯飼馬處。今亦没於草萊中矣。而前乎此者。猶有一歷史上可寳之遺蹟。關係文化甚巨。即蔡倫石臼是。我華立國垂數千年。文化發逹至早。最初祇一埃及。與我國東西並立。蓋當黃帝軒轅氏之年。埃及已建第四朝。即所謂全字塔朝也。然其文化發逹。則殊不逮我國。在軒轅氏以上。我國已歷經神農燧人諸帝之化育。脫離原始生活。而進於文明之城。自是而降。愈益昌明。發明之物。不勝枚舉。迄於炎漢。則文具亦燦然大備。如紙。即漢之蔡倫所發明者也。倫字爲敬仲。桂陽人。和帝時爲中常侍。自古畫契多編以竹。其用　帛書者謂之紙。倫始用樹膚麻頭敝布魚網爲紙。天下咸稱蔡侯紙。今耒陽縣有蔡倫廟。爲其造紙故處。石臼即在廟側。傳倫用上述</p>
<p>諸物造紙時。實就此石臼中爲之。故此臼在我國文化史上。頗佔重要地位。較鳳雛亭石鑿馬槽。僅足供後人懷想。於國家文明進步無關者。似又不可同日語矣。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>東北大學舉行畢業禮，張學良演說，謂「不將東北交還父老，不足告無罪於天下！」這話說得有聲有色，非常動聽，分明是準備着「收復東北」的决心了。但證諸往事，却又大謬不然；也許他因爲過去半年之中，備受國人的攻擊，趁今日義軍聲勢浩蕩的機會，樂得說些漂亮話，以轉移國人的視聽。其實這種現成話，只有抗日有殊勛的人說了，才使人興奮。其他素主不抵抗的人，憑你說得天花亂墜，誰也不會信任你的了。話雖如此說，但我們引一句「君子愛人以德」的老古話，總還希望他能改變方針，振起頽喪的意志與精神；報父仇，雪國恥；眞能把東北交還於國人。</p>
<h3>南京路之舊影</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>海上繁華。甲於中國。得歐風之扇拂。受物質之陶冶。於是夷樓百尺。高樓雲天。軌轍萬端。迅馳流電。凡過南京路者。莫不目眩神迷。心醉色喜。以爲模範之通衢。固當如是也。予生也晚。不知數十年之南京路。作何景象。即前輩先生之老於滬瀆者。恐事過境遷。亦早付諸淡忘。一昨見西人某所藏之攝影。有舊時之南京路一幀。觀覽之餘。不禁起今昔之感。影祇撮南京路福建路口之一角。且以虹廟爲主體。廟門樹以栅欄。一若專制時代之衙署。門有樓楹。張犢鼻褌一。蓋司香之役之所懸曝者也。廟之右則爲市肆。皆單幢之屋。門牕絶拙陋。雨淋日炙。朽裂不堪。樓牕之下。更有承　之板。板作傾斜勢。此等制作。求諸内地。尙觸目可覩。然非可言於今日之南京路也。肆大都爲屨蓆雜貨之類。主顧寥若晨星。門庭幾可羅雀。自來火燈之鐵柱。疊立路畔。獨輪之小車且欹倚之。厥境之蕭條冷寂。無以復加。誰料瞬息滄桑。蕭條冷寂者。一變而爲今日車水馬龍。士集似　。女趨若鶩之南京路哉。雖然。南京路固日新月盛矣。但我國之民生。反日窘而月蹙。其故何歟。還祈憂時愛國之君子。有以省揆之。</p>
<h3>無獨有偶之長人</h3>
<p>— 徐浣花</p>
<p>長人常樹德。　幹頎偉。高出尋常人幾一倍封神演義中之鄔文化也。客歲膺全國運動會之聘。一度南下任招待職。鶴立鷄羣。矯矯不俗。見者相與駭異。或謂體育主者。因欲藉其模範。以期運動員之咸能出人頭地。故徵聘及之。未知是否。顧常於全運會停頓後。在京不服水土。臥病五洲公園。日前已來滬。入某醫院就醫。常籍河南鄭州。據稱十八歲時。身忽暴長。其家父母兄弟。則並如常人。病愈後將隨某西人赴歐美。獻身銀幕。偶憶昔人筆記。亦有經西人自滬携歐之一長人。無獨有偶。爰錄誌巧合。</p>
<p>詹五。安徽歙人也。修八尺有餘。從其兄以販茶客滬。西人偉之。　兄之重利。載詹以行。此至歐洲。某巨族奇其狀貌。贅之爲婿。畀以數萬金。旋巨族死。詹挾重資載女婢等返滬。復事茶業。資本甚豐。居華屋。擁嬌麗。傳有云。以身發財。其詹五之謂乎。以上見倉山舊主筆記。又長人詹五。性樸質。傭於滬。貧無以自存。歐人異之。挈而歷歐洲數載。返滬則纍纍重貲。妻妾數人。居然富家翁矣。有某國女名金枝。長不及四尺。頗有面首。詹復娶之爲妾。每招搖過市。　西人携手同行之例。觀者無不失笑。一長一矮。天假之緣。殆可謂巧於撮合歟。以上見囈餘小志。</p>
<h3>繁華的夜上海</h3>
<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>華燈一上，惱人的嘈雜聲音不會較日間平靜。公子哥兒的沈醉花間，在舞榭妓寮載酒載歌，嫌熱的話，立刻可以享受冷氣電風。黃金，在都市上，祇在黃金，什麽買不到，女人？笑？狂歡？最不平的，黃浦江畔日中工人在流汗，晚上有閒階級在乘凉。</p>
<p>華爾紗的舞衣，華爾士的舞蹈，悠揚的樂聲，在催眠，在麻痺，旋轉，輕盈的舞姿！旋轉，小姐們的汽車；旋轉，賭塲裏的輪盤；旋轉着，螞蟻一般的上海人！</p>
<p>「生存競爭」，冷酷的上海，從麗安的廣告電炬花花綠綠的盡情表現出來了。白銀在狂舞，黃金在狂跳，鈔票在狂飛，可憐的上海人，賣他們的「聰明」，賣他們的身體，賣他們的良心！鈎心鬬角，他們在夢想空氣如何可以拿在手裏「托辣斯」。馬路上的野雞，就點綴了上海的文明。</p>
<p>車如流水馬如龍，人似瘋；尋仇似的臉，　　是不容虚僞的笑所可掩飾。繁弦的交響，女色，代替了日間的「多頭」，「空頭」的追逐。在狹的鴿籠裏關久了，忘記了飛翔，失却了自由，牢牢地還在自已結羅網。囚徒們，投機，取巧，誰都在幻想金錢的迷夢。</p>
<p>痴妄的僥倖心，浮薄的勢利心，像棉花裏面的針刺，大衆笑着忍受那刺後的疼痛。恥辱，罪惡，善忘的都市朋友，他們永遠在不满之中等待。　　等待什麽似的；特殊的機會，欺騙了他們一生</p>
<p>夜的上海，如同熱病，如同瘋狂，在奴隷的麻木不覺不知裏，一切的慘痛都不願意去想它，爲了力求忘記，所以在國難深創的時候，恐怖的上海又繁華了</p>
<h3>世界女航空家的發逹史（一）</h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>所謂「科學萬能」這句話，確乎不是欺人的妄言。我們試看其能力之大，不但可以使世間的萬物變形，且可以使地球的周遭縮小，於是更把古人許多的像「騰雲」「縮地」的幻想，竟由此乃使之逐漸的成爲現實的事實。</p>
<p>換句話說，如今人類雖没有爲仙花或兩肋生翼，却已會乘汽球·飛機·飛艇之類而飛入雲端；地球周遭雖未實際的縮小，却因電話，電·報·輪船·火車及飛機等之應用，使人間的一切交通事情已日見迅速。然與此兩方面都有關係者，自然是屬於航空一項。由於航空術之發明，遂把六十年前因著「海底二萬哩」，一往月的世界去旅行」而成名的科學小說家華苬氏所說的「八十日環遊世界一週」之預言，不但證實而且被打破。因爲他的理想中要八十日環遊世界一週的預期，後來竟被人以七十二日六時十一分（布萊小姐），六十七日十二時三分（　林氏），六十日三時二十九分（菲謨利斯氏），三十五日二十一時十一分（米耶斯氏），二十八日十四時三十六分五秒（愛凡斯和維爾斯二氏），二十三日十五時二十一分三秒（米耶斯和柯里耶大尉二人），二十一日七時三十四分（齊柏林伯爵），直到去年七月間，終由於坡斯特和戈推兩個人，以八日十五時五十一分作成環遊世界一週的新紀錄。</p>
<p>但看這以短時間内環遊世界一週的壯舉中，其第一次的實爲女流新聞記者布萊小姐開其始，所以這種絶大的冒險事業也决不是男子的專有物。因此我今就想把世界航空界中關於女航空家的歷史，扼要的述來貢獻於國人。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙棲記（九八）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第十二回　查前任判官司公開法價　策羣力建私宅各有人情　　話說秦掌櫃進來報告縣知事李品齋忽然棄職潛逃。這當然是地方上一件最重大最奇怪的事體。不過李品齋有好好的官不再做。在一夜之間扯腿便跑。並且早不走。遲不行。單在鄔四爺陪了這兩位貴官一到縣城的當兒。就極其神速消失了蹝跡。總應有個原故。秦掌櫃在昨晚曾聽得鄔四爺透露過那樣的口風。對於這其中來源去脈的種種曲折。心裏本很明亮。兼之昨晚特來當偵探的那個公務員。旣探得了眞消息。趕緊的回縣衙詳細報告之後。登時就把一個現任縣太爺嚇走。便也看出這回鄔四爺能力實在是可驚。憑他們這種勢利小人。原只是迎新送舊。隨風便倒。盡向高枝上飛的。自然趕緊又要倒到鄔四爺這一方面來討好賣乖。一清早便來先給秦掌櫃送信。並懇求秦掌櫃代爲禀報鄔四爺得知。說他們已來伺候新官。靜聽差遣。所以秦掌櫃這一來報告。笑迷迷興冲冲的還似報捷賀喜的一般呢。鄔四爺此時正親陪著兩位貴客在中間屋子裏用早點。聽得了這個信。喜得直跳了起來道。怎麽。那老狗跑了嗎。這究是誰通知他的。未免太便宜了這老狗了。秦掌櫃隨即說道。内情我也不大清楚。原是縣衙裏錢糧櫃上的吳師爺。前來告訴我的。他一切知道得比我多。何不呌他進來問問。鄔四爺連聲說好。那吳師爺就趁勢擺了進來。向满屋子裏的大人們。作了個羅圈大揖道。報告各位大人和四爺。那李品齋原是幹縣缺的老手。耳目甚是靈通。省城中也有不少線索。自從四縣您上省去告發他。他早已接著省裏的信。知道事情要糟。先就把一般姨太太們和金銀財寳古玩箱籠等全運到别處去了。昨晚又聽得安胡二位大人已經到此下馬。料想决逃不過這番查辦。就連夜畏罪而逃。不知去向。但他這樣跑了也好。四爺昨晚不是說過。胡大人就要來做我們的新父母嗎。如今趁此縣中無主。就請各位大人快到縣衙裏去維持現狀。并立刻打電與省裏大帥。就近速委胡大人接任。豈不是順理成章。促進這一個現成的好機會。至於地方上一切佈置。有四爺領頭。我再聯合衙中一般同事盡力報効。也决没有什麽不順手的。</p>

<h3>官樣文章的做法</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前日我做了幾篇官樣文章，說是等於不兌現的支票，但官樣文章，到底如何做法，今天再來討論一下。</p>
<p>做文章有推陳出新的法，有避實騰虚的法，若行文到了山窮水盡之處，忽然想出了别一個新意思，所謂「柳暗花明又一村，」這是做文章的絶妙佳境，現在政府要人的文章，亦是如此。</p>
<p>自一二八事變，政府中即發出「長期抵抗」四字的口號，一般國民之意，以爲旣有此種口號，定有此種事實，但自滬戰開始起，至十九路軍總退却止，除第五軍參加十九路軍作戰外，其餘並不見任何軍隊參加，又從十九路軍總退却起，至簽訂軍事協定止，京滬滬杭兩路，雖雲集不少大軍，但祗有形式上之抵抗，並没有實力上之抵抗，故一般智識淺薄的國民，以爲政府言不顧行，多所非難，政府亦覺對於長期抵抗四字的意義，何以自圓其說，那好文章就此來了。</p>
<p>某要人解釋長期抵抗的意義，謂「長期抵抗，决不單靠軍事，（第一句就好）一定從種種方面着手，」這一句涵義太廣，一般淺陋的國民，又要莫名其妙，幸虧下面有句曰「至少財政與敎育，物質上與精神上同時着手，」有此兩句注解，方才有些頭路，這就是從前文章家所謂推陳出新，避實騰虚的法子，若照現在說法，就是狹義的長期抵抗，與廣義的長期抵抗。</p>
<p>好在一經廣義，就此可以廣了開去，即如敎育，古人所謂十年樹木百年樹人，必俟百年以後，然後可以談抵抗，長乎不長，又如經濟，更有兩種意義，經濟絶交呢？還是要國家經濟充裕呢？若前一說，政府並没有所主張，若後一說，年年天災人禍，連續不斷，如欲充裕，遙遙無期，長乎不長。</p>
<p>倘然國民還要說政府不是長期抵抗，眞是寃枉。</p>

<h3>空氣中淡氣的利用法</h3>
<p>— 工</p>
<p>淡氣我們都知道，牠是空氣中的一份子，牠對於建設和破壞上，都佔着極大的勢力，好比人們天天所需要來養生的蛋白質，内中的主要成份，就是牠，至於破壞方面，則近代的一切炸藥，末有牠不興，可是牠的出產，却極少，雖然牠佔空氣的五分之四，但是没有法子來用牠，</p>
<p>直到不多長遠，有一個德人，經過長時間的研究，發明一個法子，那無窮的富藏便開掘着，現在就那這德人哈排氏（Haber）自已公布的法子，介紹給諸位，但是我要聲明，利用空氣中的淡氣法子，現在不止這一種，尙有所謂直接合併法等，因爲地位的關係，所以祗介紹這一種，</p>
<p>法先拿空氣中的養氣提完，然後那餘下來的淡氣，通入一化合室，這室内放有白金粉觸煤，再那煤爐中的（CorbonMonxide）氣通入水内，而相化變，在此化變中所發生的輕氣，便也設法通到化合室内，這樣後，就緊閉室門，一主面加熱至五百度（攝氏），一方面那氣壓加到二百個，在此情形下，淡氣和輕氣便化合，而成阿摩尼亞氣，（ＮＨ３）這氣再通到外面，再加壓力，使成流質而歸諸一切實用。</p>
<p>学</p>
<h3>暑期學校</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>暑期快到了，近幾天來，報紙上的招生廣告一天多似一天，而同時牆壁上出賣敎育的招貼，也與日俱增，但我們在報上，除了那些招生廣告之外，又發現了許多的暑假學校，不久都要開學的消息。</p>
<p>眞奇怪，學校到了暑假，一方因辦理結束事件，一方因天氣過熱，不適讀書，所以要放兩個月的暑假，而在此暑假中，各學校又偏是開辦暑期學校，一刻兒今天放暑假，一刻兒明天開暑期班，好比在玩巴戲局外自然是莫名其土地堂！</p>
<p>難道一學期的結束，一學期的開始，在三數天中，就可了事麽？旣然如此，又何必長期的停課，旣然要放假，又何必要開學？如果說辦學校的人熱心敎育，加緊工作，那麽不如不必去放這暑假，索性上下兩學期連接着，讓學生讀書好了，又何必要放暑假？眞是滑稽。</p>
<p>其實所以要辦暑期學校，個中自有原委，大多數的私立學校，所聘的敎員，都是點鐘頭給薪水的，這種學校，放假的日了，愈多愈好，因爲放了假，就可省一筆敎員的薪水，而同時寄宿的學生，如果多還可省許多伙食費，放了假，自然學生馬上回去，所以這種學校，放假的日子，多一天好一天，就是暑假，放假總比人家早，而開學總比人家遲。</p>
<p>然而兩個月的長期暑假，敎員雖不必發薪水，但房租，電燈費，自來水費，校工的工錢，却不能省却一文，和平時要一樣的支付，於是這些辦學校的先生，便發現了一種好法子，就是開辦暑期學校，橫堅課室，桌椅，現存的都有着，除了費些廣告費，和敎員的額外薪水之外，也不費什麽錢，本來樂得辦，</p>
<p>在敎員的本身上說來，這些私立學校，薪水如果以鐘點計算，停課的時期，自然拿不到薪水，就是以月份計算的，也大都作十個月計算，做敎員本來是最苦的事，平時每月所得，供一家的雜用，已有不夠之虞，那裏還有餘多的錢呢？那麽聽說學校方面開辦暑期學校，自然多少可以多得些外快，免於去負債，所以這種敎員，對於辦暑期學校，也極端的歡迎的。</p>
<p>辦學校如果目的任賺錢，自然非要會挖打不可，不會打算就不能賺錢。會打算的辦學者，靠了暑期學校，自然可以賺一筆大錢。</p>

<h3>蔣醫生的藝術</h3>
<p>— 曼倩</p>
<p>張醫生的診所裏，常是呈着一種冷清清靜悄悄的景象，難得一年半載，才有一兩個光顧來請敎他。</p>
<p>和他同師傳授對門的蔣先生，却是天天的門庭若市，應接不暇，無論遠近誰都知道了「蔣醫生」的大名。</p>
<p>張醫生羡慕着蔣醫生，一天，他禁不住的去請敎他的老同學｜蔣醫生，倒底在老師那邊多得了些什麽本領。</p>
<p>蔣醫生却祇笑嘻嘻的對他說，「老兄，您要明瞭，在這個時代裏，誰都戴着一副假面具，而您却仍是把誠懇的心來對待他們，這樣不合潮流的做醫生，怎得不失敗呢？老實對您說吧，講到我在老師那邊所學得的本領，實在還不如您，不過我是看透了社會的心理，現在把來告訴您，您不妨試試看。」</p>
<p>「第一，是診價須要定得高昂，這樣才有人來請敎您，因爲現在社會上的人們無論什麽東西，都以價格的貴賤作爲優劣標準的啊。第二，有人來請診的時候，您須得搭起架子來，務必使他們等候得不耐煩，不論您實際上是怎樣的空閑，因爲這樣才可以表現出您先生的生意忙來。第三，當您到得病家，更須表示出十二分急促的樣子來，似乎刻不容留的，屁股一着凳就寫方，寫好方拿起皮包說聲「再會」就走，這樣也可以使病家知道請敎您先生看病的實在的多，第四，您對求診者的病，須形容得萬分利害，似乎不可救藥的｜這樣若使病好了，越顯得您先生的醫術高明，就是一旦不起，也見得您先生判斷力的不錯｜最後，您所開的藥方，須要儘揀價格極貴的重味，吃好了不成問題，若是吃不好，也好呌病家知道，先生開了這樣的重味藥方，尙且吃勿好，那是注於天命了！實非人力所可挽回。</p>
<p>張醫生自從聽了蔣醫生這一片至理名言後，不到一年，以前冷落的張醫生診所裏，突然的也車龍水馬的户限爲穿，和對門蔣醫生家互爲炫耀的遙遙相對</p>

<h3>Impartial Discussion of the Student Protests at Central University</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>In recent years, student protests in our country have been surging like a tidal wave, escalating in intensity. National schools are largely mired in chaos, either due to lack of funding or absence of responsible leadership. Not long ago, the schools in Beiping stirred up a massive storm with various issues such as rejecting the president and fighting for funding, which remains unresolved to this day. Now, Central University, the highest institution of learning in the country, has been ordered to disband by the Executive Yuan due to its rejection of Duan Jiaxiu's acting presidency.</p>
<p>The root cause of this student protest at Central University is still the lack of funding. Since Zhu Jiahua resigned, the issue of the president has remained unresolved. When Duan was ordered to serve as acting president and arrived at the university to take over, a minority of students rejected him, claiming he did not meet the standards for the position and that his appointment contradicted Wang Jingwei's written response to their petition to the Executive Yuan. They then rose up to reject him, resulting in Duan being assaulted and humiliated, which ultimately led to the tragic scene of the entire university being disbanded. It is truly a sad state of affairs when students who have received higher education resort to barbaric methods and turn the school into a training ground.</p>
<p>However, can we attribute all the blame for this student protest to the students? That is not possible. The increasingly intense student protests in recent years are not accidental. The stimulation of foreign aggression, the chaos of politics, and the instability of life are the root causes of student protests. We have mentioned this repeatedly. If politics are not clarified, then everything will be in an unstable state, and there is no order to speak of. This is not limited to education. Young people are full of vigor and easily moved by emotions, and their actions may be erratic. However, the way to remedy this is not to blame the students but to look at politics itself. Moreover, it is already tragic that so many students cannot concentrate on their studies under the current circumstances of internal and external troubles. How can we bear to be even more critical of them?</p>
<p>As for the student protest at Central University, based on the analysis of the facts, we cannot solely blame the students. Central University is the highest institution of learning in the country. Yet, even the minimum funding has been delayed for a long time. The university authorities have been unable to secure funds, and petitions from faculty and staff have been unsuccessful, as have repeated appeals from students. Various projects cannot proceed. What kind of situation is this? How can a country that boasts of its vast territory and abundant resources be unable to maintain the funding for its highest institution of learning? They are constantly begging and pleading, making it like a bitter marketplace. This prevents professors from focusing on their work, and as a result, students cannot concentrate on their studies. This is a responsibility that the government cannot shirk.</p>
<p>Secondly, the biggest reason for the increasing deterioration of education in recent years is the intrusion of official parsimony. There is no doubt about it. Education is a specialized field. Duan is currently the Vice Minister of Education. If he is doing his job, he would have no spare time to handle the affairs of the ministry, let alone concurrently serve as the president of Central University. Why doesn't the government find a suitable person in the education sector and instead insists on entrusting the position to a current official? Furthermore, according to Duan's report, "When the Executive Yuan's 45th meeting resolved to appoint me as acting president of Central University, I stated that Central University is the highest institution of learning in the country and that the president must be carefully selected from those with virtue, prestige, and rich educational experience. I judged myself to be unworthy of this important task and repeatedly declined." So, Duan had already judged himself to be incapable of handling this important task and had firmly declined to the government multiple times. The government insisted on assigning a heavy responsibility to someone who judged himself incapable, forcing someone to do what they could not, which ultimately led to this unfortunate incident. The government is not only failing Central University but also failing Duan. I still remember that last winter, the government appointed Gui Chongji as the president of Central University, which also caused a disturbance. The past is not far behind, and now the same mistake is being repeated. This is another responsibility that the government cannot shirk.</p>
<p>Now, all the responsibility is being placed on the students. Many students have been arrested. The highest institution of learning has been ordered to disband. For the sake of rectifying the academic atmosphere and education, the government may have its reasons. However, sacrificing the highest institution of learning in the country for the actions of a very small number of students, sacrificing the studies of more than two thousand students, and ordering all students to leave the school within three days, and even implicating many professors who have no involvement, seems overly harsh to us. Perhaps it is a case of gaining less than what is lost.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to President Wang's recent speech, "A certain provincial government does not allow people to plant or sell tobacco, but he alone plants and sells it. Tobacco seedlings are all over the province and are all owned by him." Also, Zhang Zhen is rampaging and harassing in Zhangzhou, and the 46th Division under Chen Tiaoyuan is poisoning the local area in Taifei. Moreover, Chen Jitang is attacking Qiongzhou. If the government sincerely wants to rectify discipline and establish credibility, should it not punish the certain province that grows tobacco, Zhang Zhen who is causing trouble in Zhangzhou, Chen Tiaoyuan who is causing trouble in Anhui, and Chen Jitang who is using troops? It turns a blind eye and a deaf ear to these major issues, but it unleashes the fury of thunder on the students of Central University, disbanding the school swiftly and decisively without hesitation. Is this not prioritizing the trivial and neglecting the important? Therefore, we sincerely hope that the government will consider the difficulty of establishing Central University and handle this turmoil properly. We also sincerely hope that the government will shift its authority to those distant and major political issues and not use a butcher's knife to slaughter chickens.</p>

<p>Spanish Representative Moves to Invite Turkey to Join the League</p>
<p>Briton Butler Succeeds as Director of the International Labor Bureau</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 1st</p>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly held a special meeting today. Dr. Yan Huijing, the chief representative of China, spoke first and formally expressed agreement on extending the deadline for the League of Nations Administrative Council to submit the Leighton Report. However, he stated that the reason for the delay was not on the Chinese side, and that this delay was dangerous, so it should be limited to the shortest possible period. He hoped that the study of the investigation team's report would be completed as soon as possible, without delaying until November 1. Dr. Yan continued to say that the situation in the Eastern Provinces was very serious due to the actions of "Manchukuo." Those who violate treaties should not be reconciled with, Dr. Yan's last words were applauded by the entire venue. The Swiss representative spoke next, briefly stating that all countries in the world were deeply concerned about the Sino-Japanese incident and that the extension of the investigation team's report deadline should be limited to the shortest possible time. Representatives from Czechoslovakia, Mexico, and Spain spoke in succession, with similar sentiments to the Swiss representative. However, the Spanish representative expressed dissatisfaction with the slow progress of the investigation team's work. He hoped that the investigation team's report could promote a satisfactory resolution. Chairman Hymans, at the close of the debate, stated that his motion to extend the deadline had been formally passed and that any state that violates treaties could not be recognized. Hymans warned all parties not to take any actions that would hinder the work of the investigation team. The League of Nations General Assembly then adjourned until next week. During the debate, Japanese representative Nagaoka did not say a word from beginning to end. The full text of the motion passed by the General Assembly stated briefly that, regarding the deadline stipulated in Article 12 of the Charter, both China and Japan had agreed to extend it to the strictest necessary limit. The motion solemnly declared that the League of Nations General Assembly was compelled by the situation to adopt this special measure, which should not be cited as a precedent in the future. The General Assembly's motion stipulated that, after accepting the investigation team's report, the General Assembly Committee would determine the definite date of the extension. The General Assembly's motion declared that the General Assembly, in deciding on this extension, had no intention of unduly delaying its work. The General Assembly very much wanted to conclude its work as quickly as circumstances permitted. It goes without saying that the General Assembly hoped that the General Assembly Committee could begin studying the investigation team's report before November 1.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd</p>
<p>Yesterday, the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly formally submitted the report of the Liaoning case investigation team to the Council. The Council will not review it but will transfer it to the Committee of Nineteen, and then to the General Assembly. The Japanese Foreign Ministry absolutely opposes this and will convene a meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when the appointed Foreign Minister decides, and will telegraph the following decision conditions to the Japanese delegation: (1) The investigation team was dispatched by the Council in accordance with Article 11 of the Charter, so its report should be reviewed by the Council, and handing it over to the Committee of Nineteen without China and Japan is confusing the issue. (2) On the League of Nations side, the Manchuria issue can be said to have been in the hands of the League of Nations General Assembly since February 11 in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter, but the Japanese government has consistently opposed this and its participation in the General Assembly is subject to reservations. Therefore, it absolutely opposes the League of Nations' interference in the Manchuria issue and this contains a complete denial, so it is difficult for the Japanese representative to participate.</p>

<p>Today, at the special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly, Spanish representative Madariaga formally proposed a motion to invite Turkey to join the League of Nations.

According to people in the League of Nations, this special meeting may be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, at which time Turkey will be formally invited to join the League of Nations, and all necessary procedures are expected to be completed quickly, so that Turkey can attend the League of Nations General Assembly before the end of this month.</p>

<p>Germany May Find It Difficult to Accept Due to Inability to Bear Burden</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Lausanne, 1st</p>
<p>The new plan to resolve reparations, drafted yesterday by the five major powers, has been withdrawn after lengthy talks today between German Chancellor Papen and British Prime Minister MacDonald. It will be slightly revised and resubmitted to the German representatives tomorrow afternoon. It is now hoped that, after revision, it will become an acceptable basis for future negotiations. British Prime Minister MacDonald is increasingly becoming the leader of the meeting and remains optimistic, stating tonight that he still firmly believes that agreement is largely possible and that a final meeting can be held no later than Tuesday. The French delegation also has significant optimism tonight, anticipating an early resolution, but has not yet indicated a definite date. However, the German delegation has no such optimism, stating that if the rumored revised plan is accurate, it is still clearly unacceptable to Germany because the plan seeks to have Germany continue to pay between 600 million and 700 million marks annually after the five-year moratorium. In addition, it also hopes that Germany will compensate for the annuities not paid under the Young Plan. Germany will be unable to bear this debt, so its plan is completely unacceptable. According to reports, this new plan was discussed in the Main Committee today, with the German representatives not attending. The committee meeting continued late into the night and failed to reach a decision, so it was postponed until tomorrow morning to continue the discussion, complete the report, and then produce a formal proposal to submit to Germany. It is reported that Committee Chairman MacDonald strongly urged France to make sufficient concessions so that agreement could be reached, so the attitude of the French representatives has greatly softened. As for the guarantee clause for US war debts, German Chancellor Papen explained to MacDonald this morning the reasons why he could not accept the original format, and it has now been changed to a format with greater flexibility.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 1st</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be a day closely related to the reparations conference, as the final proposal of the five nations will be delivered to the German delegation on that day. It is heard that a method has been decided on for paying a lump sum. As for the amount of the lump sum, it has been provisionally set at 4,500,000,000 marks. The five nations have also formulated a plan as a guarantee clause. This clause will avoid directly mentioning the United States. It is not yet known how Germany will respond to this proposal.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 2nd</p>
<p>According to French sources, the Reparations Bureau, excluding the Germans, has formulated a reparations plan, which includes a lump sum with interest and a security deposit. The bonds are handed over to the International Clearing Bank, which decides when to issue and how to repay them. As for how to use the joint fund, it is detailed in a separate chapter. It is heard that the guarantee clause has been replaced by a regulation stating that this payment can be used for other purposes. This statement alludes to US war debts.</p>
<p>Busy Telephones Between Lausanne and Berlin</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 2nd</p>
<p>Telephones between Lausanne and Berlin have been busy all night, with members of the German delegation in Lausanne talking to cabinet members in Berlin, and President Hindenburg also participating. Last night, he had an hour-long conversation with Chancellor Papen on the phone, and had another long conversation this morning. Political circles acknowledged this morning that the plan for the Allied Powers to mediate the reparations dispute, submitted to the Lausanne Conference this morning, will be the final step. From the German point of view, it will enter a critical stage, and the decision is feared to be made by the end of this week or on Sunday night, as British Prime Minister MacDonald is now planning to set off for the Ottawa Imperial Conference on Tuesday and urgently needs a reply. However, the German delegation, even after discussing this major issue with Berlin by telephone, still dared not make a decision on its own, and it was necessary to convene a special cabinet meeting. Now, due to the short time, Chancellor Papen may convene it in the German town of Freiburg, on the Swiss border. The content of the new plan is not yet known, so there is no indication of the nature of Germany's response. Those who inquired with the authorities were still answered that the German government could not and would not sign any documents or accept any obligations that it could not fulfill. If the new plan does not take into account Germany's plight, then the German government will have no choice but to reject it. However, newspapers close to government circles reported that the revised new plan could serve as a basis for further discussion.</p>
<p>Location of Economic Conference Undecided</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 1st</p>
<p>The issue of the location of the World Economic Conference is also pending discussion. The general view is that it should be held under the auspices of the League of Nations, like the Disarmament Conference. If so, London will not be the location of the conference, and hopes for the United States to participate in this meeting may also be greatly frustrated.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 2nd</p>
<p>When British Prime Minister MacDonald spoke with Washington authorities on a long-distance Atlantic telephone, he mentioned the location of the World Economic Conference as Lausanne, but due to the long-distance noise, Washington misheard it as London and accepted the invitation to attend this meeting. It is now uncertain whether the United States will participate if the Economic Conference is held in Lausanne.</p>

<p>Important Meeting of British and French Prime Ministers</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 2nd</p>
<p>Since the reparations conference began working here, the meeting of British and French representatives this morning was one of the most important meetings. They are discussing a plan that includes extending Germany's moratorium for three years. After the three-year period expires, the International Clearing Bank will determine Germany's financial capacity to pay annually. Today, Great Britain is represented by Prime Minister MacDonald and Minister of Commerce Runciman, and France is represented by Prime Minister Herriot and Finance Minister Germain-Martin. The two first discussed with cabinet members in Paris, and then rushed here this morning. Upon arrival, they met with British representatives, but failed to reach complete agreement. When the representatives of the two countries exchanged views, German Foreign Minister Neurath and many journalists gathered outside the meeting venue, waiting eagerly to hear the results. It is heard that the amount of expenses that Germany should pay for the post-war reconstruction of the European economy is the main obstacle. MacDonald and Herriot will continue to meet at 4:00 PM this afternoon to try to eliminate the differences between the two sides. The meeting of the Bureau this morning at 10:00 AM has been postponed to 5:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Uchida to Recognize Puppet State Immediately After Becoming Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Puppet Minister of Communications Makes Every Effort to Flatter</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd</p>
<p>Uchida, President of the South Manchuria Railway, will return to Tokyo on the 5th and is scheduled to become Foreign Minister on the 6th.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd</p>
<p>When Uchida, President of the South Manchuria Railway, takes office as Foreign Minister, he will declare Japan's attitude to China and foreign countries, and then issue a declaration recognizing the puppet state of Manchukuo. When the puppet state of Manchukuo is recognized by Japan, it will specially appoint one councilor each from the Japanese and Manchurian people to be promoted to ambassadors or ministers plenipotentiary.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd</p>
<p>Ding Jianshiu, the puppet state of Manchuria’s Minister of Communications, visited Takusho Nagai today, saying that the number of righteous armies in various parts of Manchuria is increasing day by day, and due to the customs issue, the feelings of the United Kingdom and the United States towards the Manchuria issue are deteriorating day by day. The investigation by Leiton and his party has come to an end, and it is now the time to prepare the report. Japan should also express its final attitude at this time. If it does not decide to recognize the puppet state as soon as possible, the future of the puppet state will be very dangerous, and the League of Nations will also concentrate all its efforts to oppress Japan and Manchukuo. Nagai replied that Japan’s views were consistent with those of the puppet state. In three or four days, Tadashi will return to the country to take office as Foreign Minister, and the issue of recognition will soon be realized.</p>

<p>Democratic Presidential Candidate Roosevelt Elected</p>
<p>With the Help of the Garner Faction, Exceeding the Statutory Number of Votes</p>
<p>Will Compete with Hoover for the Presidency This November</p>
<p>Reuters, Chicago, 2nd</p>
<p>The Democratic Convention met again last night and held a fourth ballot. Chairman Garner resolutely refused to run for election, so the 90 votes he received could be transferred to Roosevelt. Then there was a slight consultation between the Garner faction and the Roosevelt faction to elect Garner as Vice President in exchange for his votes. The fourth ballot then began. It was announced at night that Roosevelt had been elected, with 945 votes, exceeding the two-thirds majority. Roosevelt will compete with Hoover in the presidential election this November. The leader of the Roosevelt faction decided to elect Garner as Vice President. The Congress then adjourned to this afternoon, at which time Roosevelt will come to the meeting to receive the formal notice of being elected. Roosevelt has approved the party platform passed by the Congress to abolish prohibition, so this year's presidential election will be a battle between the prohibitionists and the repealists.</p>
<p>Major Flood in Japan</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd</p>
<p>Since the 30th of last month, heavy rain has continued across Japan, and many places have suffered from floods. For example, the Minagawa River in Muko County, Hyogo Prefecture, has risen very high. This morning, both banks of the river were breached, and houses in the Iwaihara area were submerged. More than 30 houses have been washed away. Of the more than 200 members of the youth corps in the flood control project, more than 30 were swept away by the torrents and their whereabouts are unknown. There were also many collapsed houses in Kobe city. On the national railway, the Tokaido Line near Okazaki had water over the tracks, which was extremely dangerous. In addition, trains on the Sanyo Main Line, Hyogo and Rokusho, Fukuchiyama Line Sanda Hirono, and Aino Aimoto were all suspended. Railways in Kyushu and Kochi were severely damaged and suffered huge losses. The damage in Kagoshima Prefecture was even worse. All rivers have risen sharply, and many flood control embankments have been breached and destroyed. Railway lines have also been damaged in many places. More than 6,000 houses have been flooded in the upper reaches of the Kawatani River, including more than 800 houses that were completely submerged. Railways were also damaged, with 12 places washed away and more than 30 places on the county road and railway collapsed, indicating the severity of the disaster, which has increased the suffering of farmers.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd</p>
<p>There have been severe winds and rains throughout the country, and some parts have already suffered major floods. Farmers have been suffering greatly in recent months, and this will only increase their burden. The authorities are now implementing relief plans to try to alleviate the disaster. The exact amount of losses is difficult to determine, but it is expected to be very large.</p>
<p>Eight Small European Countries Oppose Postponement of Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 2nd</p>
<p>Representatives from Norway, Sweden, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia today visited Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, and earnestly stated that the Disarmament Conference was of great importance and could not be postponed until a practical resolution was agreed upon. They also said that the various delegations had the same opinions on aviation, national military expenditures, sky bombing, chemical and germ warfare tactics, and the management of armaments. Henderson immediately expressed sympathy. The representatives of the above countries are now afraid that President Hoover's plan to reduce armaments by one-third will hinder the work of the conference. This is why they are eager to have their painstaking efforts yield tangible results before the conference is postponed, as allowing it to disband without success would have dire consequences.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>League of Nations Investigation Team Leaves Beiping and Passes Through Yuguan to Japan</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, League of Nations Investigation Team members Leiton and other five people left Beiping on the 28th and passed through Yuguan to Japan. They had a meeting at the Beijing Hotel at 8:00 AM on the same day, and another meeting at 11:00 AM, reportedly regarding the Dalian Customs incident. They dispersed at 12:00 PM. After lunch, they packed their luggage and arranged the items they had to bring. After the arrangements were completed, the five members went to the embassies of various countries in China to bid farewell, and returned to the hotel at 5:00 PM. The members paid all the expenses of the Beijing Hotel and left the hotel by car, arriving at the station one after another at 5:40 PM and boarding the special train. The followers also entered the station one after another. Zhang Xueliang's representatives Wang Shuhan, Yu Xuezhong, Cai Yuan, Ying Ruifu, Wang Shen, Ji Shian, Liu Chongjie, Guan Yinglin, Gu Weijun's representative Wang Guangqi, and military attachés from various countries all went to the station to see them off. US Ambassador Johnson also rushed back from Miaofeng Mountain to see them off. Lin Chu, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy, ​​also went to the station with Japanese military attachés and ten soldiers, and exchanged greetings with Japanese representatives Yoshida, etc. for a long time. At 6:00 PM, the whistle sounded and the train moved. It arrived at Tianjin East Station at 9:20 PM and stopped for about 20 minutes. The train then headed east again.</p>
<p>In addition to the five members, the accompanying personnel of the investigation team included Mrs. McCoy, Secretary-General Haas and his wife, Secretary Bersani, male and female typists, the legal advisor secretary of the US member, the secretary of the French member, the secretary of the German member, and the attendants of the Japanese representative Yoshida. Our reception office sent Liu Naifan, Xiao Jirong, Zhang Wen, and Zheng Liqing to accompany them and be responsible for the reception along the way. After arriving at Yuguan, they will return by the original train. The investigation team is scheduled to arrive at Shanhaiguan at 6:00 AM on June 29, stop at Shanhaiguan for half an hour, and then board the train of the Puppet Fengshan Road out of the pass, and can reach Shenyang at 6:00 AM on the 30th. After staying in Shenyang for one day, they will transfer to Korea to cross the sea, stop in Seoul for another day, and arrive in Tokyo around July 4. Secretary Bell will go to Changchun to discuss pending issues after the team leaves Shenyang.</p>
<p>When the investigation team left Beiping, the spokesperson told reporters at the station that the five representatives were going to Japan to collect materials, and most of the documents were left in Beiping. They will stay in Japan for two to three weeks and then return to sort out the report separately. It takes a lot of time to collect materials for the investigation team. The general report can be compiled in only a week, and it can be completed in late July.</p>
<p>Gu Weijun suffered too much stimulation in Guandong, which he said he had never experienced in his life. After returning to Beiping, he falsely went to Beijing, Shanghai and Xun to report on the actual situation in the Northeast and give speeches. On the one hand, he had to prepare a memorandum, and he worked day and night for days without a moment's rest. Since the 26th, he suddenly caught a cold with a very high fever. The doctor ordered him to stop seeing guests and take a good rest. Most of the staff of the Chinese delegation, such as Liu Chongjie, Jin Wensi, and Ge Gongzhen, were scheduled to return to Beijing and Shanghai within a week.</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan Correspondence</p>
<p>The main members of the League of Nations investigation team, together with Japanese participant Yoshida and others, arrived at Shanhaiguan at 6:00 AM on the 29th, and transferred to a special train of the Puppet Fengshan Road, and left the pass at 8:00 AM. They will arrive in Shenyang that night and prepare to go to Japan via the Shenyang-Anfeng Railway and Korea. They will stay in Shenyang for one night, and it is heard that the Japanese are preparing to show the investigation team a new film of the Manchurian state, the content of which is nothing more than insulting China and promoting what the Japanese themselves consider to be meritorious deeds. A certain secretary of Leiton said to people when changing trains, We are going to suffer again, and when asked how he explained it, he said Look at what is over there, how can you not consider it a suffering. It can be seen that the people of the investigation team are also tired of the Japanese tricks. The special train sent by the Puppet Fengshan Road is still the Beining Road vehicle detained on the night of September 18. However, it is painted with a layer of paint. In addition to the three first-class cars for the five members, all the attendants can only take second-class cars. Compared with the comfort of the Beining car, there is a world of difference. The route selected by the investigation team this time is quite intentional. The Anfeng Road is the largest tool for the Japanese invasion of the three eastern provinces, and it has great military value. There are forty to fifty permanent forts built along the line. The Japanese army stationed in Korea can reach Liaoning within two days via the Anfeng Road. The theory of Manchuria-Korea integration may rely on this road as a practical link. Korea was annexed by Japan in 1910. Now, it is following the old path of annexing Korea to annex the Eastern Province. The League of Nations, which promotes assisting small and weak nations, can go and see this time, or it can help him to recognize Japan's true face. The members who are working hard have passed Shanhaiguan three times. The people of Shanhaiguan are still lining up to welcome and send them off as usual, but looking at the expressions of those people, they are no longer as enthusiastic as the first two times. A few days ago, 50 Japanese soldiers came and forcibly evicted the residents of a village in the mountains near Shanhaiguan, and turned all the houses into several small rooms. Looking at his intention, it is probably to prepare to carry out improper business there. Opium and morphine gambling grounds are just right for that kind of layout. The Japanese army of the Puppet Fengshan Road has transferred a lot to defend because the righteous army in the east is making a lot of noise. Our defense of Shanhaiguan is quite solid, and there may not be any accidents for the time being. The special train on Beining Road has returned to Beidaihe. Some of the road bureau staff went to the seaside to inspect, and on the evening of the 29th, they drove the special train back to Tangshan and stayed in the Tangshan machine factory for repair and washing, ready for the investigation team to use when they come back. (Morning of the 29th)</p>
<p>The Mystery of the Northeast</p>
<p>(3) The most important key to creating a new continent</p>
<p>(4) The Japanese's planned plan is to bring all the roads in the Northeast under the unified control of the South Manchuria Railway Company. Therefore, the Jichang, Jidun, Shenhai, Jihai, and 4 roads are called the Eastern Line of the Manchuria Railway, and the Sitao, Taoang, Taosuo, and Qike roads are called the Western Line of the Manchuria Railway. The current situation of each road is described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Eastern Line</p>
<p>Jichang Road</p>
<p>This road runs from Jilin to Changchun, with a length of 123.61 kilometers. It was built with loans from Japan and is managed by Japan. It was opened to traffic in the first year of the Republic of China. Now the Japanese and Xi Xia have signed a loan contract to merge Jichang and Jidun roads. The loan amount is 36.3 million Japanese yen, with an interest rate of 7.5%, and the term is 50 years, which will be paid off in 40 years. It is managed by the South Manchuria Railway Company, and 20% of the profits are divided into dividends each year, 40% is returned to the Jilin Provincial Government, and 40% is retained by the public accumulation of this road.</p>
<p>The nominal director of the Jichang Road Bureau is Jin Bixue, the eldest son of Prince Su, but Jin has many part-time jobs and has no time to take care of it, so the actual power is in the hands of Nakagawa Masazo, the representative of the South Manchuria Railway Company, and Toshio Tanabe, the chief engineer. Now, due to the merger with Jidun Road, the scope has been expanded, so the General Affairs, Transportation, Engineering, and Accounting Departments are also staffed by Japanese specialists. The Director of the General Affairs Department is Akami Oka Ken, the Director of the Transportation Department is Kataoka Se, the Director of the Engineering Department is Murayama Sueo, and the Director of the Accounting Department is Tani Kiyoshi. In the past, the Japanese repeatedly requested in the Sino-Japanese joint transport conference that the South Manchuria passenger cars could drive on the Jichang Road. Our government, considering military relations, insisted that it would not be allowed. Now the South Manchuria has regarded Jichang as a branch line, and since it does not allow the coexistence of two Changchun station names, it has changed the Changchun station of the road to the East Station, and since February 11, Dalian passenger cars can directly open to Jilin without having to sign another contract.</p>
<p>Jidun Road</p>
<p>This road runs from Jilin to Dunhua, with a length of 210.4 kilometers. It was built with loans from Japan and was opened to traffic in the 17th year of the Republic of China. However, this road was contracted by the South Manchuria Railway Company, and it was found that the project was of poor quality and that the project was fraudulently charged as much as 5.5 million yuan, so it has not been accepted until now. In October of last year, the Japanese military headquarters in Changchun, in the name of sluggish business and saving expenses, forcibly merged it with Jichang Road and revised the organization regulations of the Jichang Jidun Railway</p>

<p>An Abduction Case at the Huaiyin Agricultural School</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Huaiyin Agricultural School, located in Sunjia Dazhuang, about two li north of the county seat, usually has a ten-person county police team stationed inside the school. Since the current principal, Li Weizhang, took office, he has also hired national martial arts teacher Li Xingwu to concurrently serve as the police commander, and purchased a box-type gun for Li to use. However, today (the 28th) at 1:00 AM, a group of bandits dug a tunnel from the lead wire embankment north of the school site and snuck in, going directly to the teachers' dormitory and abducting the two sons of Peng Mengqi, the director of education at the school. At that time, Peng resisted, and six bandits pointed their guns at Peng and forbade Peng and his wife from making noise. Peng had no choice but to let the bandits escape to the northeast. As for the police stationed at the school, they said that they were unaware of the situation because there was no movement at the time. By the time the incident occurred, they followed the bandits to pursue, but because the sorghum was full of the field, they could not track them.</p>

<p>An Old Woman Kills Her Husband</p>
<p>Zhang Shenghao's family in Gaoqiao, Donglan Township, Jiaxing, hires worker Chen Wansheng to help with farming more than 20 mu of land. Last winter, fellow villager Jin Peihong (age 50) and his wife, Chen (age 46), resided in their house. However, Chen was inherently violent and often argued with her husband. On June 21st, Chen had another quarrel with Peihong, and Chen actually used a kitchen knife to chop open Peihong's neck, causing him to fall to the ground and die instantly. At that time, Zhang Shenghao and Chen Wansheng were working in the fields and did not know what had happened. When they returned home after work and saw it, they were greatly shocked. Chen knelt on the ground and begged not to report the incident to the authorities and hastily put him in a coffin and buried him on the ground of the Caihua Jing Wenzhou Guild Hall. However, a few days later, the incident spread through the neighborhood and was learned by the Dongmen Guanyinge Police Station. The police station ordered the arrest of Jin Chen, Zhang Shenghao, and Chen Wansheng and sent them to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation on the afternoon of June 30th. Chen confessed to killing Peihong with a knife. Zhang and Chen both testified that they were out at the time and did not know the truth. The County Bureau has now sent the three of them to the court for detention, pending an autopsy before further investigation.</p>

<p>For Financial, Military Expenditure, and Customs Problems</p>
<p>In-Depth Discussions with Soong Tzu-wen</p>
<p>Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, accompanied by Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression Li Jishen, Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Gu Zhutong, and Chu Minyi, Zeng Zhongming, and others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 AM on the night train from Beijing. After getting off the train, Wang, He, Li, and Gu went together to Soong Tzu-wen's residence on Qiqi Road to meet with Soong Tzu-wen to discuss the bandit suppression military expenses and the entire central and local financial problems. The long talk lasted two hours before they dispersed. Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Wengan also arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss the diplomatic issues of the puppet state's plundering of customs duties in the Northeast with Soong Tzu-wen. Last night at 8:00 PM, Wang, Soong, He, Gu, Luo, and others had another important meeting. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Wang and Others Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Wang, accompanied by Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chu Minyi, Minister of Education Zhu Jiaju, President of the Institute of Culture Yang Xingfu, Director of the Department of Health Liu Ruiheng, and others, arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday, getting off the train at the MacKenize Road Station. Guo Taiqi, the Minister to the UK, Chen Xinghan, the Director of the two Railways, Wen Yingxing, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Madame Wang Chen Bijun, all went to welcome them. After Wang got off the train, he went with He, Li, and Gu to his residence to rest. The other dignitaries, such as Chu Minyi, Liu Ruiheng, and Zhu Jiaju, all got off the train at the North Station.</p>
<p>Wang and Others Visit Soong</p>
<p>After Wang, He, Li, and Gu arrived at Wang's residence, they rested for a few minutes and then went together to Soong Tzu-wen's residence on Qiqi Road to meet with Minister of Finance Soong Tzu-wen to discuss the overall central and local financial problems and bandit suppression military expenses. The discussion lasted for two hours, and a general solution to the bandit suppression military expenses has been reached. However, no concrete decision has been made on the overall central and local financial problems. At 10:40 AM, Wang and others left and returned to their respective residences. Wang received reporters from various newspapers at his residence at 2:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, Wang drove to visit He Yingqin. At 5:00 PM, Wang went to meet with Soong Tzu-wen again, and then accompanied Mr. Soong to the Xiangmao Garden on Hongqiao Road to participate in the tea party hosted by Mr. Soong to bid farewell to Minister Guo and Chiang. At about 7:00 PM, Wang left first.</p>
<p>Wang's Talk</p>
<p>Wang received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Pushi Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. According to Wang, Minister He returned to Beijing from Nanchang yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday), and all the bandit suppression plans have been decided, but there is no solution for the military expenses and bandit suppression funds. We originally planned to ask Minister Soong to come to Beijing for talks, but Mr. Soong could not leave Shanghai to handle the customs duties in the Northeast. Therefore, we made a temporary decision to come to Shanghai for a meeting. As a result of the consultation, a general decision has been made. It is proposed to set the temporary expenses at four to five million yuan, and we are preparing to meet again in the afternoon. In terms of finance, the central government plans to convene a financial conference with the chairmen of the provincial governments and the directors of finance of the provinces regarding the finances of the provinces. Regarding the government, before the September 18th Incident last year, military expenditure was 28 million per month, and administrative expenses were 4 million, of which the expenses of embassies and consulates were 300,000, and educational expenses were 800,000. Now it has been reduced to 400,000. The expenses of embassies and consulates cannot be reduced any further. Now the administrative expenses have been halved to 2 million. The above two have already taken up 700,000, leaving 1.3 million, which is the minimum living expenses for the National Government and the departments below the Executive Yuan. As for the new plan to open up financial resources, it has not yet been decided. The opium public sale matter has not been completely decided either. I also mentioned it when I was in Beijing. This is a solution, but if it is handled by the wrong person, the whole country will become an opium world. No one has advocated that this must be implemented. As for the customs duties in the Northeast, Mr. Soong is currently handling it. The government hopes that the countries concerned will uphold justice. Recently, the central government has not received any news about Guangdong. We telegraphed to Guangdong last time, advising them not to cause a civil war. Guangdong has not replied. Now that the war has begun, reconciliation may not be easy. Regarding the recovery of the lost territories in the Northeast, I contacted them when I went to Peiping last time, but there were no concrete results. Because on the military side, Zhang Xueliang intends to meet with Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission, and Zhang will probably go to Guling or Hankou.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Luo Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Wengan arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 5:55 PM yesterday. Those who came to the station to welcome him were Zhang Shizhao, Zhu Hexiang, Counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Deng Zhongjie, Secretary, among others. Reporters met Luo at the station and asked about the mission to Shanghai. He replied that he was here to discuss with Minister Soong the diplomatic matters of the puppet state's robbery of customs duties in the Northeast. When asked about the issue of the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Luo shook his head repeatedly, indicating that he did not want to talk about it. Finally, Luo told reporters that the Northeast issue will definitely not be effective by simply issuing declarations and empty talk. He hoped that the people of the whole country would rise up and fight together. After Luo left the station, he took car number 5809 with Zhang Shizhao to Zhang's residence on Gordon Road. After resting briefly and having some refreshments, he switched to the car prepared by Guo Taiqi and went directly to the Xiangmao Garden on Hongqiao Road to meet with Wang, Soong, and others.</p>
<p>Hongqiao Tea Party</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, Minister of Finance Soong Tzu-wen held a grand tea party at Xiangmao Garden on Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, and welcomed Minister Jiang, the Minister to Japan, as a guest, Guo, the Minister to the UK, Taiqi, the Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu, Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Gu Zhutong, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and bankers Li Fukun, Bei Songsun, Wu Yunzhai, and Liu Ruiheng, Zeng Jianfu, and more than 50 other people were present. At 7:10 PM, President Wang left by car to return to his residence.</p>
<p>Yesterday Evening's Meeting</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM last night, Minister of Finance Soong Tzu-wen hosted a banquet for Guo Taiqi, Wang Jingwei, Luo Wengan, Gu Zhutong, Li Jishen, Gu Mengyu, He Yingqin, and others at his private residence. After the banquet, they gathered to discuss the bandit suppression military expenses and the central financial problems. There was also a very detailed discussion on the diplomatic issue of the puppet state's usurpation of customs duties in the Northeast. The meeting ended at 11:30 PM. It is said that the results of the meeting were good, and considerable decisions were made on financial and diplomatic issues.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Returns to Beijing Today</p>
<p>Because Wang Jingwei was running around yesterday and was tired, he was originally scheduled to return to Beijing last night, but now he has decided to postpone his departure from Shanghai until today. He Yingqin, Li Jishen, Gu Mengyu, and others will accompany Wang.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Zhu Jiqing Hosts Press Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reporting on the Situation of the Northeastern Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Zhu Jiqing hosted a press conference for the local press at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the situation of the Northeastern Volunteer Army. More than 30 reporters from various newspapers attended. According to Zhu's report, he said, "Today, I am hosting a press conference for you, the gentlemen of the local press. I am honored that you have come. At the same time, when I think of the compatriots outside the pass who are struggling alone and fighting the enemy, I cannot help but feel extremely concerned. When I, brothers, returned to Beijing from outside the pass, I met news reporters along the way who asked questions eagerly, which shows that the gentlemen of the press are also particularly concerned about the compatriots in the Northeast. Now, I want to report to you,"</p>
<p>"First, I will briefly state the general situation of the inspection outside the pass. It took me, brothers, less than three months to go out of the pass and back. However, the places I inspected were limited to the west of the Liao River, and the inconvenient transportation was an even greater obstacle. The materials I obtained may not be complete. However, I was born in the Northeast, and the comrades I sent to work in various places have also reported. Combining these, there may not be any major errors. 1. The psychology of the general public in the Northeast. The Northeast has been occupied for nine months. The national consciousness of the general public has not been eroded, but has been aroused unusually strongly, even though they have suffered all kinds of cruel treatment. With the exception of a few traitors who are willing to work for the enemy, the general public is eagerly hoping that the government will recover the Northeast as soon as possible to seek liberation. When I, brothers, was outside the pass, the local people told me about their suffering and asked me to convey it to the central government and the compatriots of the whole country. It can be seen that they have not forgotten the country. 2. The Japanese army's tyrannical acts. To give an example, (1) instigating Koreans to seize land, (2) depriving freedom and not allowing people to have freedom of speech is a given, but even if they read books and newspapers, they will be shot immediately if discovered. Sometimes they are unhappy and arbitrarily arrest and kill pedestrians. If a person who participates in the volunteer army is discovered, his entire family will be slaughtered. In addition, the inspection of train stations, the humiliation of women, and various other tyrannical acts cannot be described in detail. 3. The distribution of the Japanese army. At present, there are about 50,000 to 60,000 Japanese troops in the three eastern provinces, all distributed along the railway lines and in the cities. They dare not leave ten miles away, and they often gather together at night to prevent attacks by the Chinese. They are actually extremely panicked. Furthermore, the Japanese troops in the Northeast have little combat experience, weak combat effectiveness, and low morale. 4. The depression of the general Japanese people. The occupation of the Northeast by the Japanese army has caused great suffering to us, but it has also caused great losses to the general Japanese people. All businesses have mostly been suspended or withered. For example, the South Manchuria Railway Company lost more than 3.4 million yuan in the one year from April 1st of last year to March 31st of this year. This is unprecedented in the more than 20 years since the company was established. Therefore, the general Japanese people are actually very depressed. It is said that the president of the Shenyang Japanese Chamber of Commerce became mad as a result of worrying about the commercial losses since the incident and the death of his son."</p>
<p>"Second, regarding the anti-Japanese situation of the armed public in the Northeast. The armed public is what the world calls the Volunteer Army, so the Northeast Armed Public is the Northeast Volunteer Army. However, in reality, the anti-Japanese armed groups in the Northeast do not have a consistent name. Generally speaking, there are three types: (1) National Salvation Army, (2) Volunteer Army, (3) Self-Defense Army. The information about the activities of the Northeast Volunteer Army published in the newspapers now includes these three types. As for the troops of Ma Zhanshan, Ding Chao, Li Du, etc., since they are regular troops, they should be discussed separately. Regarding the number of anti-Japanese armed public in the Northeast, I can say that the people of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have more than 2 million guns, and the number is even greater in the Rehe area bordering Liaoning. About two-thirds of the households in each village have guns. Chaoyang County alone has 140,000 guns. The people of Liaoning and Rehe have contributed a lot to the anti-Japanese resistance in western Liaoning. Therefore, if there is a supply of bullets, the people with guns in the Northeast can rise up to resist the Japanese. The total number can be in the two million and tens of thousands. The number of people who are moving at any time is about 400,000, but their actions are irregular and their gatherings are uncertain, so it is difficult to obtain accurate statistics. The number of organized and frequently moving groups is about 200,000 to 300,000. According to my investigation in Liaoning, the composition of these armed public groups (organized) is as follows: (1) About 30% were bandits, (2) About 50% were farmers, (3) About 15% were soldiers and police, (4) About 5% were intellectuals. The two major shortcomings of the Northeastern Armed Public are (1) a lack of bullets and (2) a lack of unified command. The second point is being improved, and the first point is a very serious problem. We need to ask all parties to find ways to help."</p>
<p>"Third, let's talk about the process of organizing the Northeast National Salvation Army and the general situation of the National Salvation Army. 1. Process: (1) Motive: believing that resistance is necessary to save the country; (2) Name: because it aims to unite the armed public to jointly save the country, it is named the National Salvation Army; (3) Purpose of organization: to unite all parties and gradually become an organization to concentrate forces and jointly resist foreign aggression; (4) Creed: (A) resist the tyrannical Japanese, (B) deny the puppet state, (C) protect the local area, (D) support civil rule. Military plans are confidential and cannot be publicly announced. 2. General situation: About 100,000 people in Liaoning and about 50,000 people in Jilin and Heilongjiang have joined the organization, and others are being contacted or organized. Finally, the Japanese army's occupation of the Northeast was easy, which was unexpected, but the difficulty of governing was also unexpected. Bihara, the former Japanese Foreign Minister, once said, "Swallowing China is like swallowing a bomb." This is true. As long as the people of the Northeast can continue to fight for a long time, Japan will have more and more difficulties in military affairs, internal affairs, diplomacy, finance, and society. We will definitely have a day to recover our territory. From a historical point of view, the majority of changes in dynasties in China in the past were done by the people rising up. In foreign countries, France did not perish at the hands of Prussia because the French people formed a volunteer army to resist. Japan's blockade of Siberia failed and withdrew because the Soviet Russian party led the people to resist. These are all very clear examples. What we must pay most attention to is that Japan's continental policy is not only to occupy the Northeast, but to destroy the whole of China. If the Northeast is not recovered for one day, China will not be at peace for one day. The only hope for recovering the Northeast lies in those 30 million compatriots, and those 30 million compatriots can resist the Japanese invaders, which depends entirely on the more than 2 million guns, but if there is no supply of bullets, then even if there are guns, they will be useless, and I am afraid that they will be gradually confiscated by the Japanese, and the residents will be forced to escape. The Japanese army plans to wipe out the anti-Japanese people in the Northeast before the green gauze screen rises. This is currently the most critical moment. It is hoped that the press will awaken the people, urge the central government, and quickly provide assistance. Recovering the Northeast is the way to preserve the whole of China. The fate of the Chinese nation depends on this."</p>
<h3>City Party Headquarters Urges Drug Industry to Resume Work</h3>
<p>Five Demands Put Forth by Feng Cunren Employees</p>
<p>The Guild's Attitude is Strong, Warns Employees Yesterday</p>
<p>Following a labor dispute between labor and management in the local national medicine industry, the employees of Feng Cunren Pharmacy have gone on strike and put forward preconditions. Party and government authorities met yesterday to discuss solutions, and the City Party Headquarters also invited representatives of the labor union to talk, to prevent the expansion of the strike. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Employer's Attitude: After all the employees of Feng Cunren Pharmacy on Sanma Road went on strike, business has been suspended since yesterday. A notice posted on the door reads: "The shop's employees are making unreasonable demands, engaging in strike coercion, and making it impossible to operate." Two armed Chinese constables were dispatched by the police station to guard the premises for protection. Feng Jinpu, the manager of the shop, sent a letter to the trade association yesterday, stating: "Regarding your esteemed association's notice of May 16, which stated that, according to repeated decrees from the Ministry of Industry, the Central Training Department, and the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, shop employees are legally unable to join labor unions, and labor unions cannot overstep their authority by dispatching replacement workers. In the future, if labor unions continue to send unemployed shop employees to replace outdoor staff, they may be rejected in accordance with the law, etc., this shop immediately complied with your esteemed association's notice when the labor union dispatched outdoor replacement workers. Unexpectedly, on June 30, all of the shop's employees made demands, insisted on accepting the outdoor replacement workers designated by the labor union, and requested that each employee be allowed to borrow fifty yuan in advance for the 20th-year bonus. The shop's manager responded that the issue of outdoor replacement workers was based on your esteemed association's notice and in compliance with the instructions of the Ministry of Industry, the Central Training Department, and the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, and the shop was not in a position to act unilaterally and risk violating the law. Moreover, this issue concerns the entire national medicine industry in Shanghai, not just a local problem for this shop. Even if the labor union is dissatisfied, it can reasonably petition higher authorities to handle it. As for the distribution of bonuses to colleagues, it was originally intended as an incentive for colleagues' hard work in the shop's flourishing business. However, the shop's accounts for the 20th year show no surplus. This is due to the difficult business conditions, but it is also difficult to absolve colleagues of their lack of effort. They should all be aware of this and consider how to revitalize and reform the business. However, instead of doing so, they are using strike coercion and insisting on borrowing bonuses in advance, which is tantamount to dividing the shareholders' capital. According to law and human sentiment, there is no such precedent. Therefore, the request to borrow fifty yuan in bonus money in advance is difficult to accept. Although the shop's manager explained the above two points in detail, the employees did not understand and went on strike on July 1, even forcing young apprentices and cooks to leave the shop. This kind of action is truly beyond the norm. This letter is sent to your esteemed association for your review and referral to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau for investigation and correction."</p>
<p>Preconditions: After all the employees of Feng Cunren Pharmacy went on strike, the group committee put forward the following preconditions: (1) Outdoor workers must not be forced to join the trade association; (2) The replacement worker clause in the previously agreed 13 conditions must be implemented immediately, and workers dispatched by the labor union must not be rejected; (3) Last year's bonus of 60% must be issued as usual; (4) The employer should issue a public apology to all employees and must not arbitrarily insult or scold them in the future; (5) All losses of employees during the strike period shall be borne by the employer, at two yuan per person per day; (Additional provisions) (1) Those of the thirteen conditions that have not been fulfilled, such as the distribution of bonus shares and sick leave, shall be implemented immediately; (2) The dining arrangement shall be six people per table, and the employees' dishes must be treated the same as those in the reception hall; (3) Glue residue and glue charcoal shall be completely distributed equally among the employees; (4) The drug account shall be set at 40 yuan per person per year; (5) Discount: 20 cents per person per time, four times per month; (6) Employees returning home shall be under the self-management of each department, and the manager shall not make things difficult; (7) Annual bonuses shall be issued by the end of the first month of the year; (8) Jia Guang Sheng's annual bonus is 4,000 taels, and each person shall receive two months' worth each year; (9) The self-criticism letters written by the escaped workers shall be returned to the individuals immediately.</p>
<p>Guild's Measures: The measures taken by the Pharmaceutical Trade Association: (1) The Trade Association shall submit a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau, strictly ordering the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to instruct the employees of the shop to return to work by a certain date, and punish the responsible personnel of the labor union for the crime of instigating illegal strikes; (2) The Guild shall issue a serious protest to the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union; (3) Send a letter to all employees of Feng Cunren Pharmacy to warn them; (4) The management of Feng Cunren Pharmacy may propose to dismiss all employees who are illegally striking, and when necessary, the shop may take decisive and effective measures. The original letter warning the employees is recorded below: "We have just received a report from Mr. Feng Jinpu, the manager of your shop, stating that all of your employees suddenly left the shop the night before last, and as a result, business could not be conducted as usual yesterday. Based on this action, it seems that a strike has been declared. In view of this, after investigating, this pharmaceutical labor unrest has not yet reached an extreme point. This association is in the process of negotiating with your esteemed labor union on all measures. However, it is regrettable that your employees have suddenly gone on strike independently. Based on the report, we are sending this letter as a warning. We hope that all of you employees will come to your senses and resume work immediately. Otherwise, if the shop takes necessary and severe decisive measures under environmental pressure, this association will not be able to help." This is addressed to all employees of Feng Cunren Pharmacy. The letter of protest to the Labor Union states: "We have just received a report from Mr. Feng Jinpu, the manager of Feng Cunren Pharmacy, stating that all of the shop's employees left the shop on the evening of the 30th and went on strike today. In view of this, after investigating, this association has already sent a letter to your esteemed association regarding the three demands you raised with us, stating that we would reply after the meeting of our members. How could the employees of Feng Cunren Pharmacy not wait for our reply and arbitrarily engage in an illegal strike? Although it is impossible to speculate whether this was instructed by your esteemed association, your esteemed association has a responsibility and cannot shirk its blame. Based on the report, in addition to submitting it to the Municipal Party and government authorities for emergency handling, we are sending this letter to your esteemed association to protest. We hope that your esteemed association will instruct all employees of Feng Cunren Pharmacy to return to work by a certain date and impose appropriate punishment as a warning to those who do not comply. This is what we hope for." This is addressed to the Shanghai National Medicine Industry Workers' Union.</p>
<p>Negotiation Situation: The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, yesterday afternoon</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>At 3:00 PM, held an emergency meeting of various districts at the Yaowang Temple in Xiaonanmen. Feng Xingkang presided over the meeting and Zhou Di recorded the minutes. While the meeting was in session, an order was received from the Municipal Party Headquarters inviting them to talk. The discussion was immediately stopped, the meeting was temporarily adjourned, and it was decided to continue the discussion at 8:00 PM. At the same time, five representatives, Zhao Zhenhui, Feng Xingkang, Yuan Pinzhang, Fang Guanghe, and others, were appointed to attend. Wang Manyun, the director of the Civil Training Section, received them and advised the representatives that both labor and management in the national medicine industry had agreed to sign a labor-management agreement, which had been approved and filed by higher authorities, and both sides should abide by it and not violate it. If there are any inconsistencies with current laws and regulations that need to be amended, labor and management should also sign and note their opinions and submit them to the Party and government authorities for review and revision. Before the revision, it should continue to be effective in accordance with the law, and no method should be used to arbitrarily violate it, nor should excessive demands be made beyond the scope of legal interests, causing disputes. Furthermore, the trade association has been ordered to comply. It is hoped that all employees will be advised to wait quietly for a resolution in accordance with the law and to avoid any unfortunate events. The labor union representatives indicated that they accepted the advice, and the result was satisfactory.</p>
<p>Wage Increase Proposal: Among the three demands put forward by the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to the National Medicine Industry Trade Association, there is a demand for an increase of 10 yuan per month for each person. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency went to the National Medicine Industry Trade Association yesterday to inquire about the employers' attitude towards this demand. Zhang Meian, a member of the association's standing committee, answered in detail, saying that there have been three wage increases for pharmaceutical workers in Shanghai. The first was during the era of the Pharmaceutical Friendship Association in 1920, when the average wage increase was 1.5 yuan per month per person. In 1924, wage increases of 3 to 4 yuan per month per person were given based on the salary grades of employees. In 1928, as a result of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union's proposal to employers to establish labor-management conditions, wages were generally increased once again based on shop positions. The wage increase method is recorded in the conditions, stipulating and hoping that each shop with 80 or more employees is a special-class shop, with a minimum monthly salary of 20 yuan, and an increase of 50 cents for each grade (for example, if a certain shop's outdoor counter uses 20 clerks, divided into head counter, second counter, third counter, and so on, up to the accounts counter, the minimum salary for the 20 counters is 20 yuan, and the 19th counter should be incrementally increased by 50 cents, and so on, until the head counter should receive a salary of 30 yuan. The indoor counter is also divided into grades and incrementally increased in the same way as the outdoor counter.) Shops with more than 30 employees are first-class shops, with a minimum monthly salary of 18 yuan and an increase of 50 cents for each grade. Shops with more than 20 employees are second-class shops, with a minimum monthly salary of 16 yuan and an increase of 1 yuan for each grade. Shops with less than 20 employees are third-class shops, with a minimum monthly salary of 14 yuan and an increase of 1.5 yuan for each grade. (Office staff) Special-class shops receive a monthly salary of 15 yuan, and first, second, and third-class shops all receive 13 yuan per month. (Students) 12 yuan per year in the first year, 18 yuan per month in the second year, and 24 yuan per month in the third year. Interns receive a monthly salary of 8 yuan. Regardless of whether they are employees, office staff, or students, they all receive a monthly allowance of 1 yuan in addition to their salary. Xin Yi Tang and its subsidiaries with more than 21 employees are first-class shops, with a minimum monthly salary of 17 yuan and an increase of 50 cents for each grade. Shops with more than 16 employees are second-class shops, with a minimum monthly salary of 15 yuan and an increase of 1 yuan for each grade. Shops with more than 8 employees are third-class shops, with a minimum monthly salary of 13 yuan and an increase of 1.5 yuan for each grade. Shops with one to seven employees are fourth-class shops, with a minimum salary of 12 yuan and an increase of 2 yuan for each grade. (Students) are the same as He Yi Tang, and interns receive a monthly salary of 6 yuan and a monthly allowance of 1 yuan. He Yi Tang refers to old establishments, i.e., larger pharmacies. Xin Yi Tang refers to new establishments, i.e., smaller pharmacies. However, in addition to their salaries, pharmaceutical workers also have various other sources of income, such as merit pay, returns to workers, walking pay, public records, and bonuses, which are also quite substantial. Therefore, the average total income for mid-level employees in shops such as Hu Qingyu, Cai Tongde, and Tong Hanchun is over 50 yuan per month, and even lower-level employees in ordinary shops receive at least 20 yuan per month. The shops provide food and lodging for pharmaceutical workers, and the overall treatment and salary are much better than in other industries, and they are rapidly approaching the highest level in the national pharmaceutical industry. Frankly speaking, the current salaries of pharmaceutical workers in Shanghai are more than sufficient to maintain their livelihoods and should not lead to exhaustion. If they are simply greedy and insatiable, how can the employers meet their endless extravagant demands? Moreover, at a time when the social economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the labor side suddenly makes demands for wage increases, which may not be permitted by the current situation. Therefore, this demand is unlikely to be realized."</p>
<h3>Labor and Management of Silk Mills Attempted Negotiations Yesterday</h3>
<p>No Significant Results, Continued Discussions Today</p>
<p>Silk Mills in Zhabei Will Resume Work First</p>
<p>Due to issues such as wages, the Yichang and other three silk mills in the Hongkou District have gone on strike, which has subsequently affected eight factories in the district, including Yuanfeng Renji, as well as silk mills in the Zhabei District, resulting in a complete shutdown. After the Social Bureau convened representatives of labor and management for questioning the day before yesterday, they were instructed to resolve the issue directly through mutual assistance and cooperation. If no results were achieved, the Party and government authorities would formally adjudicate. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, representatives of labor and management were dispatched to the Shanghai Silk Mill Trade Association for direct negotiations. The employer representatives were Zhu Jingan, Zhang Peichuo, Wang Jinfan (Shen Chen did not attend due to an engagement). The labor representatives were Yang Shumei of the Silk Reeling Industry Union of the Third District, Chen Xiupu of the Fourth District, Zhu Jinzhang, Le Xiaorong, Yuan Yunlong of the Sixth District, Yang Gendi, Wu Suzhen, and more than ten others. Zhu Jingan was elected chairman, and Yuan Yunlong, the representative of the workers' side, first stated the eight demands of the workers, the most important of which was wages. At a minimum, the wages of female workers must be increased to 51 cents, and the wages and moth fees of workers must be restored to their original amounts before being paid at 85% of the original amount. After Chairman Zhu recorded each item in detail, he expressed his opinion, saying that the sales of foreign silk have plummeted, and the silk mills are already on the verge of bankruptcy. This is the most serious period for the silk industry. The silk mills that are currently operating with difficulty are purely to take care of the livelihoods of the workers and are mostly engaged in commission reeling. This year, only two or three factories are purchasing new cocoons. The cost of new cocoons is not low. The largest cocoon cost in Zhejiang requires 750 jin of silk, which costs over 600 taels. Even the silk waste, previously each load of silk produced from the silkworm cocoons would sell for one hundred and sixty to seventy taels, which aided in supplementing the cost. Now, double cocoons only sell for 28 taels per load, and long cocoons sell for 80 taels. Each load of silk can only sell for thirty to forty taels of silk waste. The factories are finding it even more difficult to support themselves. Therefore, all silk mills have a limited amount of work, and they must stop work once the commissioned dry cocoons are reeled clean. The workers should have a broader perspective, understand the employer's difficulties, uphold the true spirit of labor-management cooperation, and understand each other in order to maintain the status quo. Do not quibble over wages. At present, all silk mills are in debt. If everyone goes to extremes, it will inevitably lead to a shutdown, which will be detrimental to both sides. As a result, it was decided to continue the talks tomorrow (i.e., today) at 3:00 PM to discuss and cooperate with each other in order to resolve the labor unrest as soon as possible. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Zhabei District: After the silk mill workers joined the strike, the labor union representatives are now negotiating directly with the seller regarding the dispute. There are indications that work can be resumed first. Yesterday, factories on Changan Road such as Tongchangtai and Dongxing resumed work as usual, and there were no new incidents.

<h3>Brewing Labor Unrest in China General Omnibus Company</h3>
<p>Demands to Follow Last Year's Proportional Wage Increase: Labor disputes in the local China General Omnibus Company are becoming increasingly serious. Yesterday, various slogans were visible on trams in the Nanshi area, and a strike is about to break out. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representative Assembly: The First District Water and Electricity Industry Union convened a representative assembly of each branch at 9:00 PM on the 1st, with representatives from branches 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 attending. The important cases discussed were as follows: (1) Strengthening the organization case, which was passed; (2) Reorganizing the labor union attitude case, which was resolved that this union is a mass organization and there is absolutely no need for reorganization. If any party disregards the will of the masses and destroys it, it is resolved to oppose it with all its strength; (3) Wage increase case, which was resolved that workers should increase their efforts and send a letter to the board of directors in accordance with the proportional wage increase of last year's employees to begin negotiations; (4) Former standing directors Zhou Guangrong, Zhu Hanhe, and Tang Junsheng were found to have engaged in private malfeasance and embezzlement of public funds during their tenure, and are now colluding with Zhu Shaoyi to sabotage the union. It has been verified that they are guilty and should be punished. It was resolved to permanently expel Zhou Guangrong, Zhu Hanhe, and Tang Junsheng from membership and request the board of directors to immediately suspend their work to deter the unlawful and uphold discipline; (5) Opposition to the Zhu Shaoyi case, which was resolved that all members would swear to oppose Zhu Shaoyi until the goal is achieved. (The following is omitted.) The meeting adjourned at midnight.</p>
<p>Tense Situation: Yesterday morning, various trams on the Chinese-controlled roads were covered in various colorful and eye-catching slogans. The union's declarations were everywhere, such as "Expel Tramway Director Zhu Shaoyi," "Demand Equal Treatment for Employees," "Oppose Reorganizing the Union," "Oppose the Court Interfering in Popular Movements," "Down with Traitors Zhu Hanhe and Zhou Guangrong," etc.</p>
<p>Refusal to Reorganize: The Municipal Party Headquarters believed that the labor disputes in the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union were expanding and labor-management disputes were escalating, making it necessary to reorganize the union. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the new and old parties of the labor union were convened for questioning in order to begin the reorganization. At that time, former union directors Zhu Hanzhuo, Tang Junsheng, and Zhou Guangrong attended on time, while the current union directors refused to attend. Wang Manyun, the director of the Civil Training Section, questioned Tang Junsheng and others.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Malfeasance: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited the responsible personnel of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau yesterday and was informed that the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau are thoroughly investigating the case of the current directors of the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union accusing former standing directors Tang Junsheng, Zhu Hanhe, Zhou Guangrong, and others of embezzling union funds after receiving the report. The truth will be revealed soon.</p>
<p>Letter to the Board of Directors: The union sent a letter to the company's board of directors yesterday, stating: (1) In response to your letter of June 20, we understand the situation. The wage increase is an urgent problem that workers are eager to resolve. Although the company believes that it has suffered a new national disaster this year and has not yet recovered from the devastation, and that the losses since January have amounted to 600,000 yuan, it is impossible to increase the wages of workers again. This reason does have some truth to it, but it seems inappropriate based on the principle of equal treatment for employees. We believe that the company's profits and losses directly affect our workers and prevent them from receiving the usual wage increase. If we only consider the company's reasons, it is indeed appropriate. However, workers are in a society where the cost of living is increasing, and their original salaries cannot maintain their livelihoods. They have no choice but to ask the company to find ways to increase wages as much as possible, which cannot be said to be unreasonable. Our workers work diligently for the company all day long, and the company should understand their suffering and alleviate their distress. Workers cannot survive without the company, but the company cannot survive without workers, which will be even worse than workers without the company. The company's profits over the years have all been created by our workers. Now, if the company suffers a slight setback, it refuses to increase the small wages of the workers, which is unreasonable. Moreover, the employees received a wage increase in August of last year, which amounted to more than ten yuan per person, and it remains the same to this day. Since the company can increase the salaries of employees, it should be able to increase the salaries of workers in the same way. If so, the treatment of employees and workers can be equal. The branch representative assembly of our union has resolved that the wage increase must be increased in proportion to the company's increase in employee salaries last year in order to supplement the workers' insufficient living expenses and alleviate their current suffering. We hope you will understand our small hardships and give us a reply. This is addressed to the board of directors of the China General Omnibus Company, July 3. (2) Former directors of our union, Zhou Guangrong, Zhu Zhanghe, and Tang Junsheng, were found to have manipulated union affairs and engaged in private malfeasance during their tenure. Recently, they have also colluded with Zhu Shaoyi and a few labor thieves to publicly sabotage our union. Their various inferior acts have long been known to all members of our union. In order to maintain the interests of the masses and uphold union discipline, our union has decided to permanently expel Zhou Guangrong, Zhu Hanhe, and Tang Junsheng from membership and request your company to immediately suspend their work to curb the chaos. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to inform you and hope you will investigate and execute the request. This is addressed to the board of directors of the China General Omnibus Company, July 3.</p>
<p>Board of Directors' Advice: Wang Yiting and Gu Xinyi, the standing directors of the China General Omnibus Company's board of directors, believed that the worker disputes were serious and that the situation was tense. To avoid escalation, they convened the union's standing directors Tan Minglin, Hu Yida, and Zhao Sanyuan yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to advise them not to cause unfortunate incidents due to labor disputes and to wait quietly for a resolution in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Arsenal to be Moved to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Hu Sihong and Others Went to Hangzhou Yesterday to Survey the New Site</p>
<p>A Committee Will Be Organized to Take Charge</p>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal has now been approved by the Arsenal Administration of the Ministry of Military Administration to survey new factory sites in the Qiantang River Basin. According to Mr. Lin Tongyu, the chief of the auditing section of the factory, Hu Sihong, the director of the inspection department, Lin Weiyong, the director of the Zhejiang Factory, and Kang Renchu went to Hangzhou this morning to survey the sites. After the new factory sites are determined, the important parts of the machine factory, the rifle factory, the artillery shell factory, and the bullet factory will be moved inside, and other secondary parts will be moved to the Gongxian and Hanyang factories. As for the artillery factory, which is still in operation, because it still needs to repair the military supplies sent from various parties, the work will be extended for six months from April to October. The required funds will also be directly allocated by the Arsenal Administration. In the future, it may be merged into the Hanyang or Gongxian factories. After the new factory site is determined near Hangzhou, a design committee will be organized. Personnel will be sent by the Arsenal Administration of the Ministry of Military Administration and the factory to form the committee and take charge of the process.</p>
<h3>The Pseudo-State Threatens the Customs Officers in Andong</h3>
<p>Reports Received by Merrell, Inspector General of Customs: Merrell, the Inspector General of Customs, received two telegrams from the Andong Customs Commissioner yesterday, reporting on the illegal activities of the pseudo-state police in the Andong Railway Affiliated Area, which hindered customs administration. The first telegram stated: "Although this place is within the Japanese-administered railway affiliated area, yesterday (30th), a Japanese advisor suddenly led several so-called Manchukuo police officers, all in plainclothes and armed, into the office, threatening with guns and forcing the handover of files. I immediately protested and stated that this kind of extraordinary action would cause serious international disputes. The Japanese advisor claimed that he was acting on orders and disregarded the Japanese consul and all other parties concerned. I then sent a British inspector to the adjacent Japanese consulate to request protection. However, only the deputy consul was in the office, stating that he had no authority to handle the matter. Currently, our customs officers are still serving in the railway affiliated area, but three have been arrested by the pseudo-Manchukuo police within the affiliated area. At present, these pseudo-police officers have unimpeded access to the railway affiliated area. I have notified the Japanese consul in writing that if he cannot guarantee the safety of customs officers, it will be necessary to withdraw customs personnel. All Japanese officers and staff of this customs, except for Watanabe, have resigned. The pseudo-state's actions in Andong show that they will not compromise on this issue, and therefore, the customs officers are very afraid, which greatly increases the difficulty of the situation." The second telegram stated that the Japanese advisor forcibly prevented the execution of customs duties, and even temporarily exercising his authority was prevented. He had no choice but to withdraw the customs officers, but he obtained a guarantee from the Japanese consul that there would be no further illegal activities by the aforementioned pseudo-state in the railway affiliated area.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team Sends Personnel to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Soliciting Opinions on the Northeast Customs Authority Issue: The League of Nations Investigation Team is very concerned about the incident of the Northeast pseudo-state seizing customs authority. Sir Lytton, in order to mediate the dispute, sent Mr. Heim, a specialized member of the team, and Mr. Meyna, a secretary, from Peiping to Shanghai to inquire about the opinions of Finance Minister Song and Chief Secretary May. It is reported that Mr. Heim and Mr. Meyna arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and immediately went to meet Mr. Merrell. After a meeting, they were accompanied by Mr. May to meet Finance Minister Song at his residence on Xikang Road. It is reported that Finance Minister Song does not object to the International Investigation Team acting as a mediator in this matter, and Mr. Heim's trip to Shanghai also carries an important letter from Sir Lytton. A compromise solution is planned for the issue of the Northeast seizure of customs authority, but it must be approved by Finance Minister Song before mediation can begin. Finance Minister Song believes that this matter is of great importance and is still carefully considering the solutions proposed by the investigation team. Therefore, although there have been several meetings in recent days, there has been no substantial result.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Reply to Li Liejun</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei's Reply to Li Liejun:</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Mr. Xiehe [Li Liejun],</p>
<p>I respectfully received your telegram.  Everyone is rushing about north and south.  I have been remiss in replying promptly, and I know you will understand my inability to make any meaningful contribution despite my efforts and will not blame me.  I deeply admire your insightful views and have briefly explained my thoughts in a telegram.  I am grateful for your understanding.</p>
<p>For several years, I have been running about and appealing for democracy.  However, I have consistently upheld the late Premier's legacy of political tutelage, believing that we should follow the proper course of political tutelage to lead the country through genuine training during the constitutional period, so that the constitution will be truly successful. This is my unwavering conviction.</p>
<p>Regarding the resolutions and work related to national participation in politics, local autonomy, and the protection of human rights, since taking office four months ago, I have diligently supervised their implementation in the administrative sphere, striving for tangible results. However, my abilities are limited, and I cannot expect quick success, which causes me great anxiety. As for the greatest goal of popular participation in politics, I wholeheartedly strive to achieve it. I dare not disregard your advice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as far as I can see, the national crisis is deepening daily.  External aggression and internal strife are like raging storms.  The only way to overcome this calamity is to unite our strength. There is no room to leisurely discuss the merits and demerits of political systems. Though I am inadequate, I dare to resolve to thoroughly reform within my scope. I hope you will recognize my sincerity and, with a spirit of utmost dedication, join me in facing the national crisis and offer guidance.  This would be fortunate for the nation and fortunate for our party.</p>
<p>I hope your health is well. When will you come to the capital?  I eagerly await the opportunity to receive your instructions.  This is a special reply.</p>
<p>With respects,</p>
<p>Wang Zhaoming</p>

<h3>Preparatory Committee for the League to Abolish Civil War Decides to Send Representatives to Guangdong to Petition</h3>
<p>Departure pending finalization of representatives' arrangements.</p>
<p>Xiong Cheng San Advocates Using Influence to Restrain Military Force</p>

During the meeting, Mr. Xiong also expressed his opinion, advocating that to abolish civil war, we should gather the strength of the entire nation to restrain armed struggle. He suggested that postal workers, shipping workers, and railway and telegraph workers should all participate, each using their abilities to completely refuse cooperation with those engaged in civil war, believing that this would surely be effective.</p>

<h3>American Independence Day Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Marine Corps to Hold Military Games</p>
<p>Tomorrow is American Independence Day. In addition to the usual flag-raising and reception programs, this year's celebrations by the American community will begin with military games held by the U.S. Marine Corps and sailors from U.S. warships at the racecourse, starting at 7:40 AM. This will be followed by a Marine Corps review, with U.S. Consul General Mr. [blank] inspecting the troops. At noon, a reception will be held at the Consulate General as usual. The Deputy Chief Inspector of the Public Concession's traffic management anticipates heavy traffic near the racecourse in the morning and near the Consulate General at noon. Parking locations and temporary traffic routes have been designated, and additional traffic police have been assigned to provide temporary assistance.</p>
<h3>Minhang Chamber of Commerce Telegram Requesting Cancellation of Special Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Minhang Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai County sent a telegram:</p>
<p>(Formal address omitted)</p>
<p>We have recently seen reports that Jiangsu Province plans to implement a special business tax. Merchants throughout the province, believing it to be a disguised form of likin tax [internal transit tax], have risen up to appeal against it. Fortunately, the Executive Yuan issued a telegram ordering its cancellation. However, rumors are circulating that the aforementioned tax is being actively prepared and will inevitably be implemented, causing deep concern. A tax on business should only be levied on business operations. However, establishing bureaus in key locations on land and water under the name of a "special" tax, directly levying duties on goods, is not based on the business tax law. Once implemented, it will inevitably lead to cumbersome inspections and verification, and the resulting abuses will repeat the mistakes of the likin system. In the wake of floods and foreign invasions, the people are suffering. Our government authorities should be working diligently to resettle refugees and comfort the surviving population, so that the people can benefit from its benevolence. Implementing a special tax at this time violates the principle of abolishing likin and reforming taxes, goes against the fundamental intention of providing relief to the people, and is inconsistent with the central government's explicit order prohibiting the establishment of disguised likin taxes. We believe that our wise authorities would not wish to do so. We earnestly request an immediate announcement of the cancellation to uphold the law and alleviate the hardships of merchants.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xianjun, Convicted of Murder and Robbery, Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Zhang Thought of Clothing Before Execution</p>
<p>Left a Message for Wife to Collect</p>
<p>Zhang Xianjun, a resident of Tongzhou, 26 years old, along with Ma Er, also from Tongzhou (who has already been executed), robbed valuables worth over 1,000 yuan from the home of Zhu Liangshan, a resident of Qingpu, at 196 East West Huade Road, at approximately 1:00 AM on September 19th of last year. They killed Gu Tan, a relative of Zhu's, and Zhou Luo, a servant woman, at the scene. After the crime, he fled but was apprehended by Chinese Detective Cai Zhitian of the Hongkou Police Station. He was handed over to the First Special District Court, which, after investigation, sentenced him to death. The sentence was approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Shanzeng presided over the Third Criminal Court and ordered Zhang to be brought before the court to ask if he had any last words or messages for his family. Zhang stated that he previously lived at No. 8 Sanxing Lane, Tangshan Road, but had moved to No. 15 Dengtuo Road. He asked his wife to go to the police station to collect four quilts, three chests, and a half-section of a brass bed, which he heard had been taken by the police station. He also asked his wife to collect his body for burial.</p>
<p>However, the police station's lawyer stated that the defendant's belongings were still at No. 8 Tangshan Road, and the police station had not sent officers to retrieve them, which was due to a misunderstanding by the defendant. Judge Shen then instructed that the defendant Zhang Xianjun be sent to the Shanghai District Procuratorate for execution according to the law. After being taken down by Chinese and Western police officers, Zhang was escorted onto a prisoner transport vehicle, along with the case files and photos, and driven to the execution ground in Caohejing. A member of the District Court arrived to verify his identity and ordered the judicial police to bind him according to the law and execute him by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Truth About Assassination Case Gradually Becoming Clear</h3>
<p>Details of the Murder of Shi Jinkun and Dong Jigui</p>
<p>The Case Involves Wu Kaixian of the Municipal Party Committee</p>
<p>Kong Guangfu, a native of Anhui, reported to the Xinzha Police Station that Zhou Zhongyi and Zhou Zhonghua had robbed him of his property with weapons. The police station dispatched detectives and arrested the Zhou brothers. The Zhou brothers confessed that Kong and Zhang Guomin had committed an assassination. After investigation, the police station determined that the Zhou brothers, Kong, and Zhang were all major suspects in the assassination case. They had opened fire and killed Xie Abao, a worker at a Japanese burlap factory, on December 12, 1929, at Nanfuli, Robert Road. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in our newspaper previously. Now, after investigation by Chinese Detective Inspector Tang Jian, Detectives Hua Youshan, Bao Xin, Western Detective Ke Ying Maya, and others, it has been learned that the four defendants, along with two others who have already been punished, broke into the house at No. 337, Tongxing Yarn Factory dormitory on Macao Road at 8:10 PM on August 21, 1927, and shot and killed Shi Jinkun and Dong Jigui. At that time, Kong Guangfu and others were working as cadres in the Municipal Party Committee and served as investigators for the Trade Union Unification Committee. The deceased, Shi Jinkun, was also an investigator in the Unification Committee. Because he disobeyed the orders of the Trade Union, Wu Kaixian ordered Kong and others to execute Shi. Kong then broke into Shi's house with the Zhou brothers and Cai Linchuan, along with seven or eight others, that day. At the time, Shi was having dinner with his wife, Shi Dong, and her brother, Dong Jigui. Upon seeing the thugs rush in with sharp weapons, Shi Dong hid in the inner room. The group then fired seven or eight shots, killing Shi and Dong. Li [blank]xian, a judge of the former Mixed Court, examined the bodies and sentenced Han Yinhua and Guo Shushan, who were arrested earlier, to life imprisonment after investigation. To be cautious and prevent the defendants from colluding, the police station detained the Zhou brothers, Kong, and Zhang separately. Yesterday morning, they also brought Han and Guo from the Western Prison. The Zhou brothers, Kong, and others were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, then provided a detailed account of the above, stating that the four defendants were being prosecuted under Article 284 of the criminal law for premeditated murder. He presented the confessions of the four defendants taken at the police station to the court for investigation. Next, Shi Dong stated that five years ago, she lived in the Tongxing Factory dormitory on Macao Road. On July 24, 1927, several people suddenly broke into her house, and one person opened fire. Because she was afraid, she hid in the inner room and was unable to identify the faces of the attackers. After the incident, she only saw her husband, Shi Jinkun, collapse at the entrance, and her brother, Dong Jigui, die in the middle of the night. She believed the cause of death was related to the Trade Union because Shi was a foreman who had joined the Trade Union Unification Committee. He withdrew from the Trade Union due to disagreements, and two months later, the shooting occurred. The testimonies of Han Yinhua and Guo Shushan only served to exonerate themselves and were not very relevant to the case. When questioned, the four defendants denied any involvement in the murders. Kong Guangfu stated that his accusations against Municipal Party Committee member Wu Kaixian were fabricated at the police station. Finally, the defendants' lawyers, Li Shirui and Fan Gang, stated that in the interest of the defendants and for the sake of clarity in the case, Wu Kaixian should be investigated regarding whether Wu was working at the Municipal Party Committee in 1927 and 1928 or elsewhere. As far as the lawyers knew, Wu himself was not in Shanghai at that time. They also requested an additional investigation into the fact that Kong Guangfu reported to the Party Committee, which then reported to the Central Government, about Shi Jinkun's death. This point was also quite important. After reviewing the report, Judge Wu Tingqi instructed that the defendants be taken back into custody pending the review of the case files and further hearings.</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Association Calls on All Sectors to Pay Attention to Opium Monopoly</h3>
<p>The Anti-Opium Association of the Republic of China issued a circular telegram:</p>
<p>To all sectors of the National Peasants, Industrialists, Businessmen, Students, Party, Government, and all compatriots:</p>
<p>The Central Government has long held the intention of establishing an opium monopoly, and its attitude has been ambiguous, adopting a strategy of overtly prohibiting and covertly allowing. Therefore, the Central Government has repeatedly relaxed and prohibited opium use, demonstrating its ability to deceive and manipulate. Its purpose is nothing more than to demonstrate the Central Government's intention to implement a monopoly, to test whether the public has become lax on this issue, and if public opinion is still angry, to reiterate the prohibition in order to appease them and avoid a sudden and uncontrollable decision. Is this the approach that a government should take toward its people? The government's lack of sincerity in strictly prohibiting opium and its insistence on an opium monopoly are already obvious.</p>
<p>Recently, based on reports from various sources, the association has learned that the government has decided to take drastic measures and will implement an opium monopoly regardless of any sacrifices. Jiangsu Province, where the capital is located, is rumored to be the first to implement it. It is currently negotiating with Shanghai Chaozhou opium dealers on the conditions for payment and contracting. The announcement date is not far off. Furthermore, according to reports from comrades, the authorities have long planned to borrow a large foreign debt, using the revenue from the opium monopoly as collateral. A certain international organization will send personnel to be stationed in major ports to supervise our country's finances. Although it is unknown whether these rumors are true, we Chinese people, facing internal and external difficulties, should think about how to extricate ourselves. The opium monopoly is the source of internal and external troubles. We must not allow it to be realized. The association has long known that this day would come. In addition to vowing to resist to the death without yielding or surrendering, there is no excessive shock. This has long been within expectations. In such an unprecedented national catastrophe, all people feel the pain. How dare we forget the help of those who loosened their hair in grief? We urge all compatriots to rise up and save ourselves, continue to resist, and not allow the dark disaster to spread. The Party, the nation, and the people will be fortunate.</p>

<h3>Anhui Compatriot Associations Appeal for Cancellation of Special Tax</h3>
<p>The Anhui, Huining, Shexian, Xiuning, Wuyuan, Qimen, [blank], and Jixi fellow-provincials associations in Shanghai, yesterday due to the Anhui provincial government's implementation of special business taxes, jointly telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance, requesting strict orders to the provincial government to follow previous central orders and immediately cancel the tax in order to comply with laws and maintain order. They also separately telegraphed the Anhui provincial government and the Department of Finance to fight, and would not stop until the goal was achieved. Regarding the telegrams from the various county and trade associations requesting a joint appeal, it was resolved to reply by telegram, stating that there was no need to pay this illegal tax.</p>
<h3>Japanese Iron Barge Damages Taishun Steamer</h3>
<p>Wrong Route and Ignoring Warning Signals</p>
<p>Heavy Damage to Various Parts</p>
<p>Japanese ships operating in our country often cause accidents. The sinking of the Xin Daming by the Atsuta Maru is a distant example, and the recent damage to the Haiping Steamer by the Tangshan Maru is a more recent one. Now, a Japanese iron barge, disregarding maritime regulations, has damaged the China Merchants Bureau's Taishun Steamer. Details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Causes Accident:</p>
<p>The Taishun Steamer of the China Merchants Bureau, which carries cargo and passengers in Shanghai, was en route to Dalian, and then Tianjin. At 2:40 PM on December 1st, the Taishun Steamer arrived at the Dagukou of Tianjin from Dalian Bay. Guided by a pilot, it sailed to Tanggu to dock for unloading cargo and passengers. A large Japanese iron barge, named SheiMaru, towing two cargo ships, was heading out of Dagukou from Tianjin. When approaching the Taishun Steamer, it should have avoided it by heading to the left or right. Moreover, the harbor there is wide, and it was afternoon. If it had followed the waterway, no accident would have occurred. However, the Japanese ship rammed straight ahead, ignoring the Chinese merchant ship. Even when the Taishun gave a sudden warning signal, ordering it to avoid it, the Japanese ship still ignored it. By the time the Taishun turned to the right to give way, the Japanese ship had already crashed into the Taishun Steamer.</p>
<p>Taishun Damaged:</p>
<p>The point where the Taishun Steamer was hit by the Japanese ship was on the outer hull of its left side. At the time, because the iron barge was huge and heavily loaded, the impact force was very large. The iron plate on the outside of the Taishun's left cabin was immediately smashed into a large hole, and the Japanese barge's bow broke the iron chain on the Taishun's upper deck and completely smashed the left railing, causing extremely heavy damage. Fortunately, the ship was about to reach Tanggu and immediately stopped sailing, and then sailed to the dock.</p>
<p>Report to Shanghai:</p>
<p>After being hit, the owner of the Taishun Steamer reported to the Tianjin Customs and asked them to send someone to inspect the ship. On the one hand, he sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday to report to the head office. It is heard that the Shanghai office has already telegraphed Tianjin to inquire about the ship's name and the details of the damage, preparing to negotiate with the Japanese company for compensation. On the other hand, it ordered the Taishun to unload the cargo and return to Shanghai for inspection and repairs, so the amount of damage is not yet known, and it is also not clear whether the cargo was damaged.</p>
<h3>Postal Research Association Holds Second Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Wenwei Appointed Director of Special Committee</p>

The location has not yet been decided, but it is likely to remain at the United Press Association.</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Director and Deputy Director of the Security Office</h3>
<p>Zeng Zesheng as Director</p>
<p>Luo Jingyou Concurrently as Deputy Director</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, to ensure local security and tranquility, has established a Security Office. It is now learned that Zeng Zesheng and Luo Jingyou have been appointed as Director and Deputy Director respectively. Mr. Zeng previously served as Chief of Staff to Mayor Wu in Guangdong and followed Commander-in-Chief Chiang for many years. He is extremely capable. Mr. Luo is a graduate of the Army University and has held important positions such as Chief of Staff of the Anhui National Army, Senator of the Provisional Senate, and Senior Staff Officer of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government under Commander-in-Chief Chiang. He currently serves as the Chief of the Second Division of the Municipal Government and concurrently as the Chairman of the Management Committee of the Security Corps. He is excellent in both academics and reputation, and is proficient in both civil and military affairs, so the position of Deputy Director has been given to him concurrently. Mr. Luo is afraid that he lacks the energy, and it is heard that he is still humbly declining. It is also heard that the chiefs of the divisions, secretaries, and all the staff of the office have been internally decided and will be announced soon. It is heard that the Chief of the First Division will be Wen Kegang, and the Chief of the Second Division will be Chen Zhuomin. The official establishment of the office is not far off.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Merchants Proceed with Opening a Port in Sanmen Bay</h3>
<p>Wharves, Warehouses, Hotels, etc. Have Been Built</p>
<p>Now Establishing a Limited Partnership Company to Actively Manage</p>
<p>Sanmen Bay in eastern Zhejiang is a fine port in southeastern China, a key location in the coastal defense. It is rich in forests and minerals on land and has the benefits of fishing and salt production at sea. Mr. Sun Yat-sen personally went to the area to investigate and designated it as an important industrial port, as detailed in the National Construction Strategy. In 1929, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce resolved to appoint Mr. Xu Tingzuo, a prominent merchant, to take charge of opening the port. Mr. Xu drafted a detailed plan and submitted it to the National Government and the Zhejiang Provincial Government for review. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Construction Committee, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government sent personnel to jointly survey the area and concluded that it definitely had the value of opening a port. The Executive Yuan approved the order, specially authorizing Xu Tingzuo to undertake the project. Mr. Xu then followed the steps and actively managed the project, sparing no effort. All items such as wharves, warehouses, hotels, and stores have been successively built and completed, and other operations are being actively carried out. It is believed that opening a port is a material construction of extreme urgency today, and it is especially related to the development of people's livelihood. Based on this principle, the promoters Deng Jinghuan, Wang Zhongcui, Chen Boyang, Chen Bingzhi, Wang Yishu, Fang Youdu, Yu Xinghou, Guo Xinqing, and others, along with Xu, met at Yizhixiang at noon the other day to discuss the organization of a company to make it easier to achieve success. It is heard that as a result of the meeting, a joint-stock limited partnership company was organized according to the Company Law. Xu Tingzuo and Deng Jinghuan will be liable as unlimited liability shareholders, and lawyers Zhang Yaozeng and accountant Xie Lin will be hired as consultants. During the meeting, Zhang and Xie contributed opinions on the company's initial filing procedures and the protection of all legal rights, which were entrusted to Zhang and Xie to handle in accordance with the law. It is heard that the total capital of the company will still be 3 million national currency dollars, as originally planned. Apart from a portion subscribed by the unlimited liability shareholders and promoters, the remaining shares will be solicited from enthusiastic compatriots who are committed to national construction. In the future, when the company is fully organized, its success will be immeasurable, and it will be greatly beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>Zhu Qinglan's Report on Flood Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>(3) (1) Distribution of Relief Funds: Our organization, in its urgent relief efforts, allocated relief funds based on surveys conducted by provincial governments and temporary personnel sent to various regions. The amount allocated to each county was determined by these surveys. Furthermore, various inspection bureaus consulted disaster victim registers submitted by county governments, conducted further investigations, calculated the total amount needed, and determined the allocation per person. Subsequently, based on experience gained and a thorough understanding of the actual conditions in each disaster area, additional rounds of relief funds were allocated in the form of second, third, and fourth allocations. This was done partly because it was clear that the severity of the disaster would be similar across provinces, requiring careful consideration to achieve a rough balance, and partly because the government's financial resources had to be distributed in stages to ensure proper allocation. Detailed figures for each round of relief fund allocation and the number of disaster victims receiving aid will be disclosed in a separate statistical report after the overall effort is concluded. (2) Distribution of Relief Grain: The main source of relief grain was American wheat and flour, followed by flour and mixed grains purchased by our organization, as well as mixed grains and biscuits donated by philanthropists. These were distributed by commissioners in each region based on surveys conducted by provincial governments or the preferences of the majority in the local area, prioritizing essential projects. Subsequently, additional allocations were made based on the actual situation of the disaster. The total amount has reached nearly 100,000 tons. The reason for distributing in stages is similar to the allocation of relief funds, aiming for a balance based on actual needs. A table showing the distribution numbers for each province and county will be reported in detail during the statistical phase. (3) Distribution of Relief Clothing: Given the large number of disaster victims and the government's limited financial resources, only 600,000 sets of newly made cotton clothing were produced (including those made in Shanghai and Wuhan). These were reserved for the extremely impoverished elderly and infirm, with each person not guaranteed a set. The remaining clothing items, such as single-layer and double-layer jackets and trousers, and miscellaneous shoes and hats, were donated by philanthropists and overseas Chinese in various ports. Detailed distribution figures will be reported during the statistical phase. (4) Combining Relief with Work: According to the meaning of urgent relief, this organization's purpose is to save those who are cold, hungry, and on the verge of death. Restoration projects were originally the responsibility of the Relief Through Work Department. However, due to the vast disaster area, the Relief Through Work Department could not focus on the areas of the Yangtze, Huai, Grand Canal, Han, Ying, Luo, Xiang, and Yuan Rivers, so the dikes and weirs in the common disaster area were not fully taken care of. Because there were also strong disaster victims in the common disaster area, it was unfair to let them eat idly, so part of the urgent relief funds and grain was used for relief by work. Therefore, specific detailed rules for relief by work using urgent relief funds and grain were created to supplement, and were called small scale relief by work. A table of the distribution of small scale relief by work in each disaster county will be presented in a separate statistical report after the overall effort is concluded. (5) Shelters and Soup Kitchens: These two are also methods to assist in the urgent relief. The number of facilities in each region and the number of people sheltered and eating porridge will be reported in a separate statistical report after the overall effort is concluded.

<h3>Tobacco and Alcohol Taxes to be Collected by the Central Government</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Tax Bureau's Announcement No. 4, issued by the Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, states: "Regarding the matter of this announcement, the Stamp, Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance sent a telegram stating: 'Having received the telegram, we have learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Government previously requested to directly manage the tobacco and alcohol license tax. We immediately ordered the Department of Finance to send personnel to various counties to collect the tax and directly remit it to the provincial treasury.' Upon investigation, this license tax has always been directly collected by the central government, and all provinces have consistently followed this practice. Moreover, Article 2 of the Business Tax Law promulgated by the National Government clearly stipulates that this tax should be collected by the central government. It is also closely related to the regulation of tobacco and alcohol production and sales tax. It is difficult to separate them. Our Ministry has already telegraphed back to cancel the original proposal to avoid confusion and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to issue an order to prohibit it.' Based on the telegram, you are hereby ordered to inform all subordinates that the license tax bureaus should continue to follow the old regulations and strictly verify and collect the tax to comply with the original plan. This is of utmost importance." Furthermore, we have received two instructions from the Ministry of Finance, Nos. 1637 and 1639, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Association of Tobacco, Fermented Soybean, Sauce, Rice Wine, and Sauce Garden Industries sent a telegram stating: "According to the reports, the Jiangsu Provincial license tax has been taken over by the province and approved by the Ministry of Finance. What is the actual situation? Please provide clarification to dispel doubts." In response, we have telegraphed back, canceling the original proposal to avoid confusion and submitting a request to the Executive Yuan to issue an order to prohibit it. The statement in the report that it has been approved by the Ministry is completely false. The association must notify the industry to not lightly believe rumors and create panic. In addition to separate instructions, you are also instructed to investigate and inform the subordinates in the license tax bureau, follow the old regulations, and rigorously review it. Based on previous instructions, this case was reported in newspapers and reported by the branches. The branches were ordered to inform merchants to collect taxes as usual. Now, based on the instructions, aside from separate notifications, this announcement is issued. The tobacco and alcohol merchants must adhere to the Ministry’s instructions, pay taxes as usual, and not wait and see. Important. June 25th, 21st year of the Republic of China. Director Zhang Yizhi, Deputy Director Shen Zong.</p>
<h3>Farewell Party by the Chaozhou Association</h3>
<p>A farewell party was held for Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan of the 19th Route Army. The Chaozhou Association in Shanghai specially held a farewell party for Brigade Commander Weng of the 156th Brigade at 7 p.m. the previous evening.

The event began with a speech by Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu, who stated: "Today, our association is holding this farewell party. We are honored that Brigade Commander Weng has taken time from his busy schedule to attend, and that so many fellow townsmen have enthusiastically participated. Brigade Commander Weng is one of the most important contributors to the war of resistance against Japan. Today's farewell banquet is not just due to hometown feelings, but also due to our admiration for a military officer who defends the country. Brigade Commander Weng studied in France and has an amazing record in aviation. His bravery and decisiveness are admired by the French. Now, based on his spirit, he serves the country. Brigade Commander Weng has made significant contributions to the Battle of Shanghai. Brigade Commander Weng has dedicated himself to the country. Take care on your journey. In addition to suppressing bandits, you must also pay attention to the thorough implementation of the war of resistance against Japan." Brigade Commander Weng then delivered a speech, stating: "Since retreating from Wusong, I have failed to live up to the expectations of my fellow townsmen, and I feel ashamed. This time, I have been ordered to open up Fujian, and my mission is to wipe out the bandits and communists who are wreaking havoc in the rear. However, Fujian Province is located on the coast, and national defense is particularly important. My original intention to resist Japan and defend the country remains unchanged. I will encourage myself to live up to your expectations." Then guest Yin Zhiling gave a speech, saying: "In the past, the organizations of various hometown associations were mostly aimed at the interests of the hometowns themselves. The establishment of the Chaozhou Association in Shanghai happened to be between the September 18th and January 28th Incidents. Its enthusiasm for national salvation is the first in Shanghai. The Chaozhou Association really seeks benefits for the country, not just for fellow villagers. I hope that you will uphold the spirit of the Chaozhou Association, expand from a small group to a large group, and then there will be hope for our country's future." Subsequently, fellow townsmen Huang Guoliang, Weng Ziguang, Guo Juru, Guo Shuopeng, Zhou Yisheng, Zheng Yingshi, and others gave speeches, praising the past and encouraging the future. The chairman gave a speech of thanks, and they dispersed after taking a group photo.</p>

<h3>A Procuress Injured a Young Prostitute to Death</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Eight Years in Prison. Yu Shunmai, a 17-year-old woman, was sold by her parents to Shi Zhang, a woman from Songjiang, at No. 136 Ailaige Road in the French Concession for 240 yuan. The young woman walked the pleasure grounds to find customers. Because the woman was not good at entertaining, the Zhang used violence, beat her in every possible way, and burned her with candle fire.

On May 10, the French police discovered this, and Detectives Jin Chengshan and Hang Guangfu investigated and arrested Zhang, and removed the deed of sale and sent the girl to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

The girl’s condition worsened and treatment was ineffective. The girl died on the 27th. Her body was examined and the coroner announced that it was not claimed. The police then prosecuted Zhang for the crimes listed in Articles 296 and 316 of the Criminal Law. Judge Li Changnian held several hearings. The defendant was defended by lawyer Yang Zhihao. The hearing was adjourned. However, because there were still doubts in the case that had not been clarified, a debate was reopened on the 25th of last month, and the defendant's landlord, Chen Wan, and neighbor, Shi Zhu, were summoned to court and testified about the abuse and burning of the victim. Therefore, the debate was immediately adjourned, and the date for sentencing was set.

<p>Qiu Sizhang, a 23-year-old native of Fujian who resides in Southeast Asia, missed his motherland and break the people’s closed minds, a year ago, gathered three female and three male comrades to form the Asian Walking Group to walk through Asia. His family advised him not to listen, so he left his family to show his firmness. The seven people who traveled together departed from Penang in Southeast Asia in February of last year and passed through the Malay Federation, Aulosda, Siam, Burma, etc., before entering the country. Wherever they went, they were treated well by the local government and overseas Chinese and given appropriate protection. When they arrived in Menglong, which borders Yunnan Province, China, they encountered a flash flood. The group floated on the water for three days and was rescued by the local chief and sent to Cheli County. Many members of the group fell ill and sought medical treatment at a Christian church hospital, where they recovered after half a month. The county chief selected armed police officers to escort them to Simao, and then north to Pu'er, intending to turn east to Guangxi and then to Yuanhe County. However, they encountered bandits, but fortunately the county chief protected them, so they did not suffer. However, in the mountains of Baise County in the western part of Guangxi, they encountered communist bandits. Two female comrades and one male comrade were killed by the bandits. Of the remaining two male comrades, one died on the journey due to illness and the other returned to his hometown. Therefore, the members of the group have been dispersed. When he arrived in Guangdong, another female comrade came to Shanghai by boat in Hong Kong, and Qiu came to Shanghai alone via Fujian. He arrived at 12:00 noon the day before yesterday, and said that the original intention of this trip was to fight the environment with bare hands and create a great career with spirit. Therefore, since the initial launch from Southeast Asia, he had never received assistance.

He is now visiting Mayor Wu, asking him to find a way to recommend him to the Central Military Academy in order to fulfill his wishes.</p>

<h3>Chao Brothers Establish Clinic</h3>
<p>The Chao brothers, Yiming and Yifei, from Menghe, are extremely enthusiastic about charitable undertakings. In view of the inevitable epidemic after the war, they have established a clinic in Jianye Lane, Xinzha Road, starting from July 4th. It is said that they have hired famous doctors such as Tang Jifu and Yun Ruizhen. All medicines are provided free of charge and supplied by the Guangdetang Chinese pharmacy, which is owned by the Chao brothers. This is truly good news for the poor and sick.</p>
<h3>Grand Occasion of Low Prices at Sino-French Pharmacy</h3>
<p>Since the Sino-French Pharmacy Main Store on Beijing Road and the Sino-French branches on Sanma Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Xihua De Road, and Shiliupu jointly launched a large-scale price reduction and free gift campaign, retail and wholesale sales have been unusually crowded and business is booming.

<h3>Inauguration of Zhonghe Bulb Company</h3>
<p>The Zhonghe Bulb Company at No. 49 Beijing Road was inaugurated on the 1st of this month at 11:00 AM, creating quite a stir. It is understood that the company is a joint venture of General Electric Edison, Osram, and Philips, with the sole purpose of manufacturing light bulbs in China so that they can be sold at lower prices with high quality. The General Electric Edison plant, located on Rue Robert in Shanghai, has been manufacturing the well-known General Electric Edison bulbs for many years and will now be the manufacturing plant for Zhonghe Bulb Company. The factory has received much assistance and guidance from the General Electric Company of America, which is the leading company in the United States with numerous experts and has made many contributions to the electric lighting industry. Furthermore, the German Osram Company and the Dutch Philips Lighting Factory will also provide strong support, so the Philips and Osram bulbs manufactured in China in the future will be no different from those currently imported. The expansion of the factory is also planned. Currently, there are over 1,000 Chinese employees, and the number will continue to increase. This joint venture will save a lot of money in terms of manufacturing and sales, and the result will be a reduction in the selling price of light bulbs.</p>
<h3>Kailin Paint's Excellent Products</h3>
<p>Kailin Paint Company was founded in the early years of the Republic of China by Zhou Yuantai, who has been diligently managing it. In recent years, business has been booming, and the quality of its products has almost surpassed that of imported goods. In 1929, the company purchased more than 30 mu of land on East Sports Association Road and built a new modern cement and steel-frame factory building, which is currently under construction. Suddenly, the Shanghai War broke out, and the company's old factory was completely destroyed by fire. Fortunately, the new factory still stands tall, which is a piece of good luck amidst misfortune. Now that the Shanghai War has ended, the company has been able to continue its operations. Over the past month, despite difficulties and dangers, it has installed machinery, which has gradually been completed. The internal layout is well-organized and orderly, and the design is so meticulous that it can be called the best among the factories in Shanghai. Special attention is paid to the workers' livelihood, so labor and management cooperate, and output has increased even more. Products such as paint, enamel paint, varnish, blended paint, white lead, red lead, and other types of paint are in short supply among domestic and foreign buyers, which is a good indication of the state of the domestic paint industry.</p>
<h3>Free Copy of "The Truth After Suicide"</h3>
<p>In recent years, China has been facing increasing national crises and economic hardship, and suicide incidents have been frequently reported. Hongye Layman, with a compassionate heart, wrote the book "The Truth After Suicide" to advise the public. The book cites extensively from ancient Chinese learning and touches on medicine, biology, philosophy, and spiritualism, so the reasoning is very accurate and the arguments are very persuasive. Mr. Zhang Yijun, Mr. Wang Yiting, and Mr. Wang Peisun have written prefaces for it. The entire book is divided into three chapters. The first chapter discusses the various pains of suicide, such as drowning, hanging, and poisoning, which are all different, and refutes Spencer's principles of biology. The second chapter discusses the truth after death, collecting facts from China and abroad to prove the suffering of suicides after death. The third chapter is a rational evaluation, using profound philosophical principles to comment on the evils of the world, with every word being relevant and deserving to be called a masterpiece. The book has already been published. We would like to introduce it here. Those who wish to obtain a free copy of the book should write their name and address and attach a one-cent postage stamp to the Book Donation Department, Nantang Middle School Supplementary Section, Wai Rihui, Longhua Road, Shanghai. A copy will be sent immediately. If you can widely promote it after reading, it will be a great merit.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education to Convene a Discussion with Presidents of Higher Education Institutions on the 10th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has scheduled a discussion meeting for the presidents of all public and private higher education institutions in the country on the 10th of this month. One day, Minister Zhu, Vice Minister Qian, various counselors, the Director of Higher Education, and the two section chiefs of the Higher Education Department held a meeting to discuss the matters to be discussed at the meeting of presidents of higher education institutions. It is reported that the discussions will cover the following items: (1) Determining funding issues, (2) Improving teacher salaries, (3) Reorganizing overlapping departments and programs, (4) Revising the organizational law for higher education institutions, (5) Drafting curriculum standards, and (6) Rectifying academic atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Holds Department Meeting</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education held a department meeting on the afternoon of the 1st. The minister, vice minister, secretaries, counselors, directors, section chiefs, and others attended. Minister Zhu presided over the meeting. The meeting discussed the problems that the Ministry of Education should prepare in advance for convening the presidents of higher education institutions on July 10th to come to Beijing to hold a meeting, so that they could be presented at that time.

<h3>Zhu Jiahua Speaks on the Nanking University Student Unrest</h3>
<p>Minister of Education Zhu attended the meeting of the Board of Directors of the British Boxer Indemnity Fund and arrived in Shanghai last night by night train. He stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel and issued the following statement regarding the Nanking University student unrest: This Nanking University student unrest is the most unfortunate event in the Chinese education community. In order to rectify the academic atmosphere, the government had no choice but to take decisive measures. The process has been announced. However, as the person in charge of educational administration, I witnessed the student unrest occurring in the highest institution of learning in the capital, and the president was beaten and humiliated, which made me feel extremely uneasy. Therefore, I immediately tendered my resignation at the meeting of the Central Political Committee and the Executive Yuan, and formally submitted my resignation request. However, before the government appoints a successor, I will continue to be responsible. As for the expressions of some professors and students after the incident, they are also expected in the student unrest. However, the newspaper reduced some professors to hold so-called professor meetings, slandered me, and could not slightly state the truth. The points they pointed out are as follows: (1) Regarding the flood relief donation, the donation was deducted in nine, ten, and three months. At that time, it was planned to deduct the entire amount in three months and remit it to the disaster relief agency in full. However, because the funds of Nanking University were owed too much by the Jiangsu education funds, the funds received in November were not enough to pay the full salary for September. Therefore, the accounting team made a transfer deduction of the flood relief donation when paying the salary, and there was no cash. The professors were notified in writing before the salary was paid. When the October salary was paid in December, I had already resigned from the school. Some professors automatically convened a professor meeting and interfered with school affairs in the name of the meeting. Because the funds received were not enough to pay the full salary for the previous month, the flood relief donation was also transferred and deducted. When the November salary was paid, I had formally resigned, and the professor meeting decided to stop deducting the flood relief donation and automatically return the already deducted income to be remitted. Therefore, the "embezzlement of flood relief donation" by the professor meeting is the truth. The flood relief donation was not embezzled, nor was I personally responsible. The professor meeting seems to have forgotten what it did.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the distribution of salary, some faculty and staff requested advance payment of salary arrears due to resignation, following the previous practice. At this time, the school affairs were handled by Liu Guanghua, Dean of the Law School, and a revenue and expenditure committee appointed by the professor meeting directly supervised the affairs of the accounting team. The salary payment was approved by the committee members, and the salary payment book was stamped by the revenue and expenditure committee, which is on record and the responsibility lies there.</p>
<p>As for the section "implying that professors are manipulating and persecuting professors" in my previous speech, this kind of nitpicking is even more absurd. I have served in education for more than ten years and have always respected the status of professors. My past words and deeds are all there, and I do not want to argue more. I will not respond to any future comments on the Nanking University student unrest.</p>

<h3>Record of Striking the Bell at the Ancient Temple (41)</h3>
<p>—斋夫 (Zhai Fu) who doesn't remove the courtyard grass</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Jiang said, "You villagers are truly capable. After learning for four hours, you dare to deal with bandits. The usual military formalism, even if you studied it for four months, wouldn't be as practical as today."</p>
<p>In my opinion, today is like two people working as one teacher. Battalion Commander Jiang's martial skills are extremely high; I admire him in every way. In this era of high-pressure imperialism, why did such a good young military officer resign? I find it somewhat perplexing. Mr. Zhu has never studied military affairs. But Battalion Commander Jiang seems to need him. Battalion Commander Jiang's martial skills are mostly genuine, but they also include a lot of military formalism. When they discussed how to start training, Battalion Commander Jiang mentioned many things to learn, while Mr. Zhu only focused on his true skills and discarded his military formalism. Battalion Commander Jiang is like opening a restaurant, and Mr. Zhu is ordering dishes and writing the menu for us. Shark fin, bird's nest, bear's paw, monkey brain, dragon and tiger stew are all unnecessary. What we need are only green vegetables, tofu, braised pork, and butterfly noodles—all inexpensive, delicious, and filling things. Every time Battalion Commander Jiang mentioned something, Mr. Zhu would always ask, "The bandits will be here in four hours; is this something that absolutely needs to be learned tonight?"</p>
<p>In this way, removing the dross and extracting the essence, four types of emergency training were determined.</p>
<p>There's one more thing I must not forget to describe. Old Li, the blacksmith, said, "When we discover that the bandits are coming, we should first fire a blank shot into the sky to make the bandits retreat when they know the difficulty. If we fire a blank shot first, and they still want to come, then we will open fire with real bullets. Even if they die, they will have no complaints." Everyone thought this was very humane and unanimously approved it. Because we organized this militia, we only aim for self-defense and never want to harm anyone's life, and do good deeds.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu also added a suggestion, saying, "Even if enemies come, we should aim for their legs when shooting. We only need to deprive them of their fighting ability to achieve the purpose of self-defense. We must not necessarily take their lives. We must have a spirit of not killing the innocent to control the power of the people." This was also unanimously approved. This method is relatively difficult to implement because it is not easy to aim accurately in night battles. But Mr. Zhu's idea is precisely because it is not easy to aim accurately in the dark, so don't let everyone fire guns lightly, to avoid accidentally injuring their own people. Good, our ancient temple self-defense group is no less than an ancient temple Bodhisattva group, interesting! To be honest, our hearts aren't really in it. Fighting bandits doesn't count as anything. Protecting children and eliminating imperialism are our real goals!</p>

<h3>Vines Wins Wimbledon Championship</h3>
<p>| Six to Four, Six to Two, Six to Zero, Crushing Defeat of Austin |</p>
<p>Mrs. Moody Wins Fifth Women's Singles Title London, 2nd – For the first time in fifty-five years at Wimbledon, an American and British player met in the finals. As a result, the 20-year-old American youth Vines defeated the British Austin six to four, six to two, six to zero, and won the championship. Vines' shots were like lightning. Austin, in the first set, exhausted all his strength to resist, resulting in six to four. In the last two sets, Vines treated Austin as if he were a child in the palm of his hand, with Austin only winning two games.</p>
<p>Truly Tilden the Second London, 30th – Since Vines' crushing defeat of Crawford, whether Vines is the second Tilden has become a topic of discussion at Wimbledon. Tilden's prestige still remains, and his peak tennis skills are all models for those who come after him. Since entering the competition, Vines has not shown his strengths. Now, after defeating Crawford, people know that he is not to be underestimated, and the doubts have disappeared. He swept the entire court, and his performance was rare at Wimbledon. Crawford's victory over Panley was effortless, but now, against Vines, he surrenders without resistance. Vines' smashes have almost become a "swift terror." His forehand smash goes straight to the corner, like lightning. Then, with his backhand, he attacks the other wing again. His terrifying serves and net kills are like a violent storm, leaving no ground untouched. The grass dust of the Wimbledon lawn also flies up. Crawford's incoming balls, Vines casually waved over the net. When Crawford defeated Panley, his performance was at its peak, but now, against Vines, he has nothing left.</p>
<p>Mrs. Moody Wins Again London, 1st – Mrs. Moody won her fifth Wimbledon women's singles title today. She won the championship in 1927, 28, 29, and 30.</p>
<p>Mrs. Moody is as Solid as a Rock As a result of the finals between the two American Helen ladies, Mrs. Moody defeated Ms. Jacobs six to three, six to one. Mrs. Moody is as solid as a rock, and her perfect smashes left Jacobs at a loss. However, Jacobs also tried her best to resist in the first set, taking the lead with three to two, with an imposing aura. She tried to make Mrs. Moody run east and west with extremely clever chops.

<h3>Review of the Securities Market in the Past Three Days</h3>
<p>Settlement and Account Closure, Market Closed for Three Days</p>
<p>Market Conditions Quiet, Prices Fall Back</p>
<p>The trading situation in the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange market this week was due to the fact that it was the end of the month for settlement and the end of the year for account closure. The market was closed for three days throughout the week. Therefore, there were only three trading days last week. Spot transactions were scarce, with only sporadic entries and exits each day, totaling only 63,100 yuan. The futures market was also generally quiet, with over 5 million yuan traded on Tuesday, which was relatively high. The other two days were only 2-3 million yuan each, totaling 10.97 million yuan. This included 2.685 million yuan in salt tax, 1.685 million yuan in consolidated tax, 1.515 million yuan in the 20th Customs, 1.395 million yuan in the 20th Cigarette, 1.085 million yuan in the 19th Benevolent, 680,000 yuan in the 19th Customs, 975,000 yuan in troop reduction, 550,000 yuan in disbandment, 270,000 in the 6% Consolidation, 100,000 yuan in customs duties, and 30,000 yuan in the 96 Public Bond. Although the August futures have been opened, the trading volume is extremely small, with only over 200,000 yuan traded for all bonds combined. Furthermore, the changes in the bonds seem to be greater than before, presumably due to the deteriorating situation, the breakdown of peace in the South, and the outbreak of war. There are also many rumors in the North, which has caused unrest in the market. The number of sellers is far greater than the number of buyers. In addition, it is the end of the previous account closure period and the end of the month for the delivery of goods, so the demand in the market is sluggish. As a result, the supply and demand are quite disparate, and the prices of all bonds have generally fallen compared to the previous week. On the first day of the week, the 6% Consolidation fell by 1.5 yuan, which was relatively large, and the other bonds fell by around 7-8 jiaos. On Tuesday, the North Gang sold off fiercely, and the prices fell sharply. For example, troop reduction fell by 2.7 yuan, and others fell by 1 to 1.89 yuan. However, on the day after settlement, the market situation was slightly better, and buyers made some purchases, so the prices rebounded by around 1 yuan. However, as a result, the prices were still down by around 1 yuan compared to the previous week. The situation in the bond market does not seem optimistic for the time being. The high, low, and fluctuations of each bond price during the three days of this week are listed below.

The average price of industrial stocks fluctuated by more than one point on only two days. On Monday, it fell by £1.83, and then it fluctuated slightly. On Friday, it rebounded by £1.55.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Continues to Advance Towards Peak</h3>
<p>Spot yarn from Yunnan and Guangdong buyers is strong, and the cotton yarn market is gradually trending towards firmness. Demand for spot yarn continues, and Yunnan and Guangdong buyers are actively purchasing. This has inspired confidence in the market. In addition, raw cotton prices are soaring, so new buyers are also emerging. The situation is firm, but sellers are taking a stable approach due to the tight financial situation in the country. The future will depend on actual sales.</p>
<p>Distant Month Bids Rise Again Foreign bids opened with flat American cotton. The market opened with flat confidence. Each month fell by 2-3 qian, and then rose again on the 2nd and 3rd rounds.

<h3>Cotton Market Increasingly Intense</h3>
<p>The cotton market trend is very tight and the situation is quite expensive. Most local psychology is based on the serious insect damage of American cotton. Speculators purchase to do more, so the market is becoming more and more tight, and the demand is still flat. Overseas cotton markets are also flat. Rui Da newly purchased 7,000 dans, Xin Cheng sold 4,900 bales. The future of the cotton market still depends on American cotton. The inventory in Shanghai depots is gradually increasing, it is said.</p>

<h3>American Cotton's Whereabouts Uncertain</h3>
<p>Firm Due to Excessive Rainfall</p>
<p>Later, Due to Profit-Taking, It Became Weak</p>

British cotton futures rose by 15-16 points. Spot rose by 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 15 points. Indian cotton was firm due to short covering and speculator purchases.

The original telegram is recorded on the left (1st telegraph): American Cotton, Change from Previous Day, Equivalent Shanghai Rules, British Cotton, Change from Previous Day, Equivalent Shanghai Rules, July 410, Fall 3, 25.50, October 436, Up 13, 29.30, October 577, 2, 26.30, December 440, 1, 629.80, December 591, 3, 26.90, January 441, 1, 629.90, January 599, 1, 27.20, March 447, :, :, 30.30, March 614, Flat 27.90, May 442, :, :, 30.70, May 629, 1, 28.60, Spot 465, 1, 631.70, Spot 375, 5, 26.20, Egyptian 646, 1, 543.90, Ping Gu Er 141.00, Up 5.00, 22.00, Aomura 163.50, 4.50, 23.50, Bai Luo Xi 166.50, 5.50, 24.90</p>
<h3>American Cotton Still Firm Last Week Due to Boll Weevil Damage</h3>
<p>New York, July 1st, reported the cotton market situation for the week. The buying interest in the raw cotton market this week was not active, but sales were low except for near-term settlements. Prices soared. There are often showers in the eastern part of the cotton belt. Except for South Texas, there is also too much rainfall in the western regions. This is all conducive to the propagation of boll weevils, which raises concerns about the future of the new cotton crop. Private figures indicate that the condition of the new cotton crop at the end of June is above average. However, some parties predict that if the weather in July and August is unfavorable and boll weevils cannot be contained, the condition of the cotton crop will plummet. Merchants received 40,700 bales of July delivery cotton, of which 15,000 bales are rumored to be shipped to Germany. At the same time, there is also a rumor that a portion of the July cotton will be shipped to Japan. General public opinion is that the trend of the cotton market depends on the relationship between this year's cotton production and the season's needs. At the same time, the boll weevil damage has boosted the bullish sentiment.</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Tightens and Softens Again</h3>
<p>Hu Nan Yesterday, 15-16 boats arrived from each gang. Rural stores were slow because foreign rice turned weak. People were confident and transactions were still slow. Changxi Beigeng fell again by some jiaos. Arrivals of early and late rice were not many, and sales were minimal. Bian Yin Yuan sales were flat, and the market was also stable. Arrivals of Foreign Pointed Rice were scarce. Due to the sharp price declines in recent days, only the top-quality goods moved slightly, resulting in mediocre prices.</p>
<p>Xin Zha Yesterday, Jiangyin Yang Rice was the most common among the boats arriving from the west. This street store was weak and slow. Jiashan Pinghu early rice inventory was still abundant. The thick and thin geng rice market weakened again by one jiao. The situation was in a slump. Both Foreign Pointed rice inventories are thin, and the market has no ups and downs. Although Nuomi rice arrivals are lacking, there is no sales momentum. The market is trending downward. River foot millet is about 2,500-600 dans.</p>
<h3>This Street's Smooth Foreign Rice Purchase</h3>
<p>Price Continued to Rise by One Jiao and a Half Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation: North Gang purchases stagnated. Inland villages and estates had slightly more inquiries. However, purchases in this street turned active, with nearly 10,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice and 1,000 bags of Saigon rice being purchased. People's confidence was excellent, and the market immediately rose by a jiao and a half. However, only half of this batch of entrants were actually selling. The other half were speculators who will have to exit as soon as the market price rises again. Therefore, if there are more strong sales today and tomorrow, the market price must rise again. Otherwise, it can be temporarily stable. Total daily transactions were 12,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice at prices of 9.90 yuan to 9.75 yuan. Middle and Secondary grades were 9.67 yuan to 9.55 yuan. 1,000 bags of Saigon rice at prices of 11.20 yuan to 11.15 yuan. 500 bags of Wenzhou rough rice at a price of 9.20 yuan. 230 bags of Jiangxi machine yuan rice at prices of 13.90 yuan to 13 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Standard Powder Lingers with a Slight Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the powder market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month generally showed a mixed picture of hovering and fatigue.  Very few transactions occurred for the current month, with both buyers and sellers taking a wait-and-see attitude.  Trading in the deferred months, however, was quite active, because merchants from the interior, seeing floods in various places and finding the weather difficult to predict, were quite eager to buy. At its highest, it was about one cent or so better than the previous month. However, after the second session, it continued to soften.  It is rumored that foreign merchants also sold foreign powder to foreign firms and sent it to Tianjin, with a combined price of only 1.78 taels.  With such competition, the sales of Shanghai powder will naturally be greatly impacted.  Therefore, the difficulty in reviving the standard is truly insurmountable.  As a result, the current month was down 0.025 taels from the previous day, August and September down 0.05 taels, and October to December down 0.025 taels each.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Stable</h3>
<p>Wheat futures opened with 6,500 bags.  Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month was generally stable.  Although the price of foreign wheat was down about 0.1 taels, the general short sellers, due to floods in various places, continued to actively sell, and for a time, the buying interest was quite strong, and the market was bullish.  However, some merchants from Wuxi, because current wheat was very cheap, and more suitable than the standard, continued to sell.  The future outcome will depend on actual consumption.  As a result, the current month was up 0.03 taels from the previous day, August up 0.01 taels, September unchanged, October up 0.03 taels, and November up 0.02 taels.  The current wheat market is still tending to be stable.  Arrivals were very strong, about 10,000+ bags, with only half sold.  Wheat opened at 2.84 taels for Kaihengjing wheat, 2.82 to 2.88 taels for Zhitang wheat, 2.78 to 2.77 taels for Penglai wheat, 2.82 to 2.77 taels for Shuangfeng wheat, 2.72 taels for Taicang wheat, 2.8 taels for Kunshan wheat, 2.75 taels for Zhitang wheat, 2.7 to 2.65 taels for Baihegang wheat, 2.72 to 2.77 taels for Wangxianqiao wheat, 2.7 taels for Huangdu Wusong wheat, and 2.68 to 2.65 taels for Anting wheat, with a total of 6,500 bags opened, handled by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Dutch Red Sugar Dealings Quite Active</h3>
<p>Trend Quite Bullish. Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's market disk was very quiet, but sentiment was still good. Dutch sugar No. 24, coarse granulated white sugar, was transacted at 14.2 taels, high-quality goods at 14.25 taels, Hong Kong goods at 14.05 taels, No. 14 raw granulated white sugar at 12 taels, No. 8 and 9 Dutch red at 10.02 taels, and the market shape was quite firm. Taikoo's entries and exits were slack, CW mark at 15.75 taels, DY mark at 15.55 taels, HX mark at 15.3 taels, HM mark at 14.9 taels, PX mark at 10.2 taels, H mark at 12.4 taels, transactions were scattered, and the trend was very stable. Zhendianghao offered 500 bags of Hong Kong goods grain granulated white sugar at a price of 14.05 taels, Huaxinhao sold 2,000 bags of No. 8 Dutch red sugar at a price of 10.01 taels, 1,300 bags of coarse granulated white sugar at a price of 14.2 taels, and Benchang Shuihua Qing Xiangyuan sold 300+ bags at a price of 11.3 taels, and the industry's intention to import was very strong, selling through as many as possible, which was quite popular. In addition, Xiangyuan Factory produced large bags of water-before, opening at 15.4 taels, and more than 100 bags were sold. Yesterday, the asking price rose to 16 taels, but for a time, there were few inquiries.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods, New Haikou Branch Second Session Slightly Better</h3>
<p>The second batch of goods from the new Haikou branch arrived the day before yesterday, totaling more than 500 pieces. Yesterday, it was heard that the various shops in the North and South markets have gradually opened up, with prices as high as 12.5 taels, and as low as 9.2 taels, slightly better than the first session. Because the prices are cheap, the traffic from all sides is still lively. The third batch will also arrive soon, and the asking price should not be too outrageous.</p>
<h3>New Golden Needles Vegetables Have Arrived in Hankou</h3>
<p>The Handling Price is Twenty-One Taels. According to a telegram from Hankou yesterday, the first batch of new golden needle vegetables from Chenzhou has now arrived in Hankou, with a price of 21 taels. Adding all external expenses, the allocation to Shanghai must be about 24 taels. If it is handled by the Shanghai gang, it can be shipped to Shanghai soon. The initial offering should not be too outrageous.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Shexian Zhenmei Trends Towards Firm and Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of foreign firms in this port, Zhenmei green tea from Lailuzhuang, British firms such as Tongfu, Jinlong, Yihua, and Xiehe, etc., spared no effort to search and buy. Tianxiang Fu Shi Foreign Firm also resumed opening, and the situation became more and more stable. Among them, Shexian Zhenmei, due to the thinness of the stock, and the firm attitude of Chinese tea merchants, the market disk has already rebounded by four or five taels. People's hearts in Tunxi, Suian, and other roads are also uniformly upward. However, the first batch of Gongse Zhenmei from the two roads of Wuyuan Northwest has recently arrived. Although Baocang, Yihua, and other firms have inquired about the disk price, the Chinese merchants, in view of the hot sales of Tunxi and Shexian Zhenmei, are even harder than before, and new prices are difficult to open.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Sichuan Gang Searches for Chocolate Coatings</h3>
<p>The Sichuan-North gang suddenly started searching for mixed-color oblique-dot chocolate coatings the day before yesterday, and as a result, sales were very good. The atmosphere in the Tongyi Association was very tense. Checking the stock of French goods, there is not much in the market. Foreign firms have goods to arrive. As a result, the selling price has risen by several cents. Yesterday, Hao Hua Ningfeng chocolate coating wholesale price has risen to 2.9 taels per yard, and other brands such as Shunguan Long Lie Feng, etc. are 3.05 taels. Light-colored ones are even more popular.</p>
<h3>Summer Woolen Cloth Sales Sluggish, Prices Cheap</h3>
<p>The woolen cloth market was still stable yesterday, and the trend of various goods was soft, especially the white serge, white straight tribute, feather yarn tweed, yellow twill, flannel, Barre tweed, and white calico that are needed for summer sales were even weaker. Because the buyer's needs have stalled, resulting in sluggish market sales and reduced selling prices. Yesterday, Hanping white serge was reduced to 3.9 taels, white straight tribute tweed was 3.5 taels, Hao Shi was 3.75 taels, Yongle Tianxiang white serge was 2.75 taels, Daluh Hengli mercerized strip feather yarn tweed sold for 1.6 taels, and Hualun suit feather yarn tweed was 2.825 taels.</p>
<h3>Hardware, New Lead Wire Price Falls by 0.025 Taels</h3>
<p>New lead wire, newly arrived Eastern goods are secretly active, causing British and American goods to be hit. Transactions along the Yangtze River are mostly suspended due to frequent rises in the river. The provinces of Fujian, Shandong and Hebei have all reduced their purchasing power due to tight money, so the market situation is very soft. Therefore, the standard has fallen back by 0.025 taels, such as No. 16 to No. 20, estimated at 12.5 taels per picul, and No. 21 to No. 25 sold for 18 taels. It is found that the number of openings in recent days is very small, so the future market situation is still pessimistic.</p>
<h3>American Tinplate, Current Goods in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of 200-pound American tinplate has been limited, and the needs of various manufacturers are at a strong period, so the market goods show a phenomenon of supply not meeting demand. The current standard is 13 taels per box for 90 pounds, 15 taels for 100 pounds, 31 taels for 200 pounds, and 28 taels for 180 pounds. It is heard that more than 2,000 boxes have been sold in recent days.</p>

<h3>Beauty Trap</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>There was a German named Möllendorff, who was the German vice-consul stationed in Korea. Möllendorff thought the job of vice-consul was too hard, so he sought the lucrative position of customs official at the Jianghan Customs in China. Möllendorff himself told me about the scandalous history of taxation.</p>
<p>Chinese people regard the job of customs officer as a shortcut to wealth. Positions like "sampler" are highly sought after, and people even want to change them every day. These shameless people can actually do it all. In fact, this is just a microcosm of the Chinese people's secret to getting rich by being officials.</p>
<p>Chinese people can only get rich by being officials, and the common people are always unlucky. The methods of getting rich by being officials are becoming more and more intense, and new methods are emerging endlessly. And the despicable psychology of Chinese society also takes getting rich by being officials as its pursuit of fame and fortune. Scholars study hard, their goal is fame and fortune, but they can still work hard and seek fame and fortune through exams. But despicable villains use other opportunistic methods to achieve the goal of becoming officials and getting rich. Their pursuit of means is like mercury spilling on the ground, penetrating everywhere, only seeking to become officials, regardless of shame, and even resorting to the beauty trap.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that Chinese people are blinded by profit, but even foreigners can accept the beauty trap. This shows that foreigners' desires are not necessarily weaker than ours. Perhaps only pure religious figures are not moved by desires. This is why religious figures are disliked by the world, and it is also why they are liked by the world.</p>
<h3>Historical Sites of the Han Dynasty in Leiyang</h3>
<p>— Tianhen</p>
<p>Leiyang, Hunan. It was established as a county in the Han Dynasty. It was changed to a prefecture in the Yuan Dynasty. It was restored to a county in the Ming Dynasty. In the Qing Dynasty, it belonged to Hengzhou Prefecture in Hunan. In the early Republic of China, Hengyang Road was established, and Leiyang belonged to it. At the end of the Han Dynasty, Pang Tong once served as the magistrate of this county. His name became famous. History calls Tong a native of Yang. Sima Hui called him the crown of scholars in Southern China. The First Lord ordered him to guard Leiyang. He did not govern well. Lu Su said, "Tong is not a talent for a hundred-mile county. If he is placed in the position of chief administrator, he will be able to show his full potential." The First Lord summoned him to be the chief administrator. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the opposite of this. History says he did not govern well. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms records that Tong was addicted to alcohol and neglected his duties. The First Lord ordered. Lord Guan to interrogate him. Sun Qian accompanied him. Tong spent half a day resolving all the lawsuits, money, and accumulated cases of the officials in the past three months. The rights and wrongs were clearly distinguished. The people admired him. He did not govern badly. Therefore, there are still two historical sites today. One is Phoenix Chick Pavilion. The other is a stone trough. These are the old objects of that time. Although the pavilion has been repaired many times, it is still on the verge of collapse. The stone trough is the place where Lord Guan fed his horses. Now it is also buried in the weeds. Before this, there was still a historically valuable site. It is closely related to culture. That is Cai Lun's stone mortar. China has been established for thousands of years. Its culture developed very early. Initially, there was only Egypt. It stood side by side with China in the East and West. During the reign of the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, Egypt had already built the Fourth Dynasty, the so-called pyramid dynasty. However, its cultural development was far behind China. Before Xuanyuan, China had already experienced the cultivation of emperors such as Shennong and Suiren. It broke away from primitive life. It entered a civilized city. From then on, it became more and more prosperous. The inventions are countless. By the Yan Han Dynasty. The stationery was also brilliantly prepared. For example, paper. It was invented by Cai Lun of the Han Dynasty. Lun's style name was Jingzhong. He was a native of Guiyang. During the reign of Emperor He, he was a eunuch. Since ancient times, paintings and contracts have mostly been compiled with bamboo. Those who use silk to write are called paper. Lun first used tree bark, hemp heads, torn cloth, and fishing nets to make paper. The world called it Cai Hou paper. Today, there is a Cai Lun Temple in Leiyang County. It is the place where he made paper. The stone mortar is next to the temple. It is said that when Lun used the above-mentioned</p>
<p>things to make paper. It was actually done in this stone mortar. Therefore, this mortar occupies an important position in the cultural history of our country. Compared with the Phoenix Chick Pavilion and the stone trough. It is only enough for future generations to reminisce. It is not related to the progress of national civilization. It seems that it cannot be mentioned on the same day.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Northeast University held a graduation ceremony. Zhang Xueliang gave a speech, saying, "If I don't return the Northeast to my elders, I will not be able to declare myself innocent to the world!" These words were said eloquently and very moving, clearly preparing for the determination to "recover the Northeast." But based on past events, it is very different; perhaps because he has been attacked by the people of the country in the past six months, he is happy to say some beautiful words on the occasion of today's righteous army's powerful momentum to divert the public's attention. In fact, these ready-made words can only excite people if they are said by people who have made special contributions to the Anti-Japanese War. Other people who have always advocated non-resistance, no matter how eloquently you speak, no one will trust you. Although that's what I said, we quote an old saying, "A gentleman loves people with virtue." We still hope that he can change his policy and revive his decadent will and spirit; avenge his father and wipe out national humiliation; and truly return the Northeast to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Old Shadows of Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The prosperity of Shanghai is the best in China. It has been fanned by European style and nurtured by materials. Therefore, foreign buildings are hundreds of feet high, and high-rise buildings reach the sky. There are tens of thousands of tracks, and the speed of the current is lightning fast. Those who pass through Nanjing Road are all dizzy and fascinated, intoxicated and happy, thinking that the model thoroughfare should be like this. I was born late and don't know what Nanjing Road was like decades ago. Even the seniors who are old in Shanghai are afraid that things have changed and they have long been forgotten. Yesterday, I saw a photograph of old Nanjing Road in a collection of a Westerner. After viewing it, I couldn't help but feel the feelings of the past and present. The photo only captured a corner of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road, and the Hong Temple was the main body. The temple gate was set up with a fence, as if it were a yamen in the era of autocracy. The gate had a building. It was wearing a loincloth. It was where the incense servants hung and dried their clothes. To the right of the temple were shops. They were all single-story houses. The doors and windows were extremely crude. They were weathered and cracked. Below the window, there was a supporting board. The board was tilted. This kind of production can still be seen everywhere in the interior. But it cannot be said in today's Nanjing Road. The shops are mostly selling straw mats and groceries. There are few customers. The door can catch sparrows. The iron pillars of the kerosene lamps are erected on the roadside. The small car with a single wheel is leaning against it. The desolation and loneliness of the area cannot be added. Who would have thought that in an instant, the vicissitudes of life, the desolation and loneliness, would be transformed into today's Nanjing Road, where cars are like water and horses are like dragons, and scholars gather like clouds and women flock like ducks. Although. Nanjing Road is becoming more and more prosperous. But the livelihood of the people in our country is becoming more and more difficult. Why is this? I also ask the gentlemen who are worried about the times and love the country to reflect on it.</p>
<h3>Unparalleled Tall Man</h3>
<p>— Xu Huanhua</p>
<p>The tall man Chang Shude. His torso is tall and strong. He is almost twice as tall as ordinary people. He is like Wu Wenhua in the Investiture of the Gods. Last year, he was hired by the National Games. He once went south to serve as a receptionist. He stood out from the crowd. Those who saw him were shocked. Some said that the organizers of the sports event wanted to use his model to make the athletes stand out. Therefore, he was recruited. I don't know if it's true. However, Chang was not acclimatized to Beijing after the suspension of the National Games. He was ill in Wuzhou Park. He came to Shanghai a few days ago. He went to a hospital for treatment. Chang is from Zhengzhou, Henan. It is said that when he was eighteen years old, his body suddenly grew rapidly. His parents and brothers are all like ordinary people. After he recovers from his illness, he will go to Europe and the United States with a Westerner. He will devote himself to the screen. I remember a note from a former person. There was also a tall man who was taken to Europe from Shanghai by a Westerner. It is unparalleled. I recorded it to show the coincidence.</p>
<p>Zhan Wu. He is from She County, Anhui. He is more than eight feet tall. He went to Shanghai with his brother to sell tea. The Westerner admired him. His brother valued profit. He carried Zhan with him. He arrived in Europe. A giant tribe was surprised by his appearance. They made him their son-in-law. They gave him tens of thousands of gold. Soon the giant tribe died. Zhan took the heavy assets and female slaves back to Shanghai. He returned to the tea business. The capital was very rich. He lived in a luxurious house. He embraced beautiful women. It is said that he made money with his body. This is what Zhan Wu is talking about. The above is from the notes of the former owner of Cangshan. The tall man Zhan Wu. He is simple in nature. He is a worker in Shanghai. He has no way to support himself. The Europeans were surprised by him. They took him to Europe for several years. When he returned to Shanghai, he had a lot of money. He had several wives and concubines. He was actually a rich man. There was a woman from a certain country named Jinzhi. She was less than four feet tall. She had a lot of face. Zhan remarried her as a concubine. Every time he swaggered through the market. The Westerners held hands and walked together. The viewers couldn't help but laugh. One tall and one short. The fate of heaven. It can be said to be a clever combination. The above is from the Small Records of Delirium.</p>
<h3>Prosperous Night Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yan Meng</p>
<p>When the lights come on, the annoying noisy sounds are not calmer than during the day. The young masters are intoxicated in the flowers, singing and dancing in the dance halls and brothels. If it is hot, they can immediately enjoy the air-conditioned fans. Gold, in the city, only in gold, what can't you buy, women? Laughing? Revelry? The most unfair thing is that workers are sweating on the Bund during the day, and the leisure class is enjoying the cool in the evening.</p>
<p>Walzer's dance clothes, Walzer's dance, the melodious music, is hypnotizing, is paralyzing, rotating, light dance posture! Rotating, the ladies' cars; rotating, the roulette in the casino; rotating, the ant-like Shanghainese!</p>
<p>"Survival of the fittest," the ruthless Shanghai, is fully expressed from the colorful Lian advertising lights. Silver is dancing wildly, gold is jumping wildly, banknotes are flying wildly, poor Shanghainese, selling their "intelligence," selling their bodies, selling their conscience! They are dreaming of how to take the air in their hands and "trust" it. The wild chickens on the road decorate the civilization of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Cars are like running water and horses are like dragons, people are like crazy; the faces of revenge are faces that cannot be concealed by false smiles. The symphony of strings, female sex, replaces the pursuit of "longs" and "shorts" during the day. After being locked in a narrow pigeon cage for a long time, they forget how to fly, lose their freedom, and are still firmly weaving their own nets. Prisoners, speculators, tricksters, everyone is fantasizing about the dream of money.</p>
<p>Foolish luck, superficial snobbery, like needles in cotton, the masses laugh and endure the pain after the sting. Shame, sin, forgetful urban friends, they are always waiting in dissatisfaction. What are you waiting for; special opportunities, cheated them all their lives</p>
<p>Night Shanghai, like a fever, like madness, in the numbness of slaves, unwilling to think about all the pain, in order to forget it, so in the deep wound of national disaster, the terrifying Shanghai is prosperous again</p>
<h3>History of the Development of Female Aviators in the World (I)</h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>The so-called "science is omnipotent" is indeed not a deceptive lie. We try to see the greatness of its ability, not only can it transform the world's things, but also can shrink the circumference of the earth, so that the ancient people's many fantasies like "flying through the clouds" and "shrinking the ground" are gradually becoming a reality.</p>
<p>In other words, although human beings do not have fairy flowers or wings on both sides, they have already learned to fly into the clouds by airships, airplanes, and airships; although the earth's circumference has not actually shrunk, the application of telephones, telegraphs, ships, trains, and airplanes has made all traffic matters in the world increasingly rapid. However, the one that is related to both of these aspects is naturally aviation. Due to the invention of aviation, the prophecy of the science fiction writer Hua Xiu, who became famous sixty years ago for "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" and "Traveling to the World of the Moon," was not only confirmed but also broken. Because his ideal of traveling around the world in eighty days was later achieved in seventy-two days and six hours. Miss Blair), sixty-seven days twelve hours and three minutes (Lin), sixty days three hours and twenty-nine minutes (Fe Morris), thirty-five days twenty-one hours and eleven minutes (Miers), twenty-eight days fourteen hours thirty-six minutes and five seconds (Evans and Wells), twenty-three days fifteen hours twenty-one minutes and three seconds (Miers and Captain Collier), twenty-one days seven hours and thirty-four minutes (Count Zeppelin), until July last year, the two people, Post and Gotui, finally made a new record of traveling around the world in eight days fifteen hours and fifty-one minutes.</p>
<p>But looking at this feat of traveling around the world in a short period of time, the first one was actually started by a female journalist, Miss Blair, so this kind of great adventure is by no means a male monopoly. Therefore, I would like to briefly describe the history of female aviators in the aviation world and contribute it to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Record of Coexisting in the Military (98)</h3>
<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve Check the Open Legal Price of the Former Magistrate Sima Build Private Houses with Collective Efforts Each Has Human Feelings It is said that Treasurer Qin came in and reported that the magistrate of the county, Li Pinzhai, had suddenly abandoned his post and fled. This is of course the most important and strangest thing in the local area. However, Li Pinzhai had a good official position and no longer wanted to do it. He pulled his legs and ran away overnight. And he didn't leave early. He didn't go late. He only disappeared extremely quickly when Grandpa Wu accompanied the two noble officials to the county seat. There should always be a reason. Treasurer Qin had heard Grandpa Wu reveal such a tone last night. He was very clear about the various twists and turns in this origin. In addition, the civil servant who came to be a detective last night. After obtaining the true news, he hurried back to the county government to report in detail. He immediately frightened the current county magistrate away. It can also be seen that Grandpa Wu's ability is really surprising this time. Based on their kind of snobbish villains. It was just welcoming the new and sending off the old. It fell with the wind. It flew to the high branches. Naturally, he had to hurry up and fall to Grandpa Wu's side to curry favor and sell well. Early in the morning, he came to send a letter to Treasurer Qin first. And he begged Treasurer Qin to report to Grandpa Wu to let him know. He said that they had come to serve the new official. He was waiting for orders quietly. So Treasurer Qin came to report this time. He was smiling and full of excitement, like reporting a victory and congratulating him. At this time, Grandpa Wu was personally accompanying the two distinguished guests in the middle room for breakfast. He jumped up when he heard the letter and said. What's wrong? Did the old dog run away? Who notified him of this? It's too cheap for this old dog. Treasurer Qin immediately said. I'm not very clear about the inside story. It was originally Wu Shiye, the treasurer of the county government, who came to tell me. He knows everything better than me. Why not call him in and ask. Grandpa Wu said yes repeatedly. Wu Shiye took the opportunity to enter and bowed to the adults in the house. Report to all the adults and Grandpa. Li Pinzhai was originally a veteran of the county magistrate. His ears and eyes are very keen. There are also many clues in the provincial capital. Ever since you, Sijun, went to the province to accuse him. He had already received the letter from the province. Knowing that things were going to be bad. He had already transported all the concubines and gold, silver, treasures, antiques, boxes, etc. to other places. Last night, he heard that the two adults, An and Hu, had already arrived here. He thought that he would definitely not be able to escape this investigation. He fled overnight in fear of crime. His whereabouts are unknown. But it's good that he ran away like this. Didn't Grandpa say last night. Master Hu is going to be our new parent official? Now, while there is no one in charge of the county. Please ask all the adults to quickly go to the county government to maintain the status quo. And immediately send a telegram to the Grand Marshal of the province. Appoint Master Hu to take over nearby as soon as possible. Isn't this a matter of course? Promote this ready-made good opportunity. As for all the arrangements in the local area. With Grandpa Wu taking the lead. I will join hands with the general colleagues in the yamen to do my best to repay. There is definitely nothing that is not going well.</p>

<h3>The Way of Official Writing</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The other day, I wrote a few articles in the official style, saying they were equivalent to bounced checks. But what exactly is the method of official writing? Let's discuss it again today.</p>
<p>There are methods of writing that introduce the new by discarding the old, and methods that avoid the real and focus on the empty. If the writing reaches a dead end, and suddenly a new idea emerges, the so-called "beyond the darkest willow, brightest flowers, another village," this is the most wonderful state of writing. The articles of important government figures are also like this.</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the government has issued the slogan of "long-term resistance." The general public believed that with such a slogan, there must be such a reality. However, from the beginning of the Shanghai battle until the general retreat of the 19th Route Army, except for the 5th Army participating in the fighting with the 19th Route Army, no other troops were seen participating. Furthermore, from the general retreat of the 19th Route Army until the signing of the military agreement, although many large armies gathered along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, there was only resistance in form, and no resistance in substance. Therefore, the generally ignorant public believed that the government did not act according to its words, and criticized it in many ways. The government also felt that it was difficult to justify the meaning of the four characters "long-term resistance." That's where the good article comes in.</p>
<p>A certain important person explained the meaning of long-term resistance, saying, "Long-term resistance definitely does not rely solely on military affairs (a good first sentence), it must start from various aspects." This sentence has too broad a meaning, and the generally shallow-minded people will be puzzled again. Fortunately, there is a sentence below that says, "At least finance and education, material and spiritual aspects should be addressed simultaneously." With these two sentences of annotation, there is finally some direction. This is what the ancient writers called the method of introducing the new by discarding the old, and avoiding the real and focusing on the empty. If we put it in today's terms, it is narrow long-term resistance versus broad long-term resistance.</p>
<p>Fortunately, once it becomes broad, it can be broadened indefinitely. For example, in education, the ancients said that it takes ten years to grow a tree and a hundred years to cultivate a person. We must wait until a hundred years later before we can talk about resistance. Is it long or not? As for the economy, there are two meanings: economic severance? Or should the national economy be prosperous? If it's the former, the government has not advocated it. If it's the latter, natural and man-made disasters occur year after year, continuously. If one wants to be prosperous, it is nowhere in sight. Is it long or not?</p>
<p>If the people still say that the government is not engaging in long-term resistance, it is truly unjust.</p>

<h3>Fifty Quatrains on Poetry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Meng Shaozhu</p>
<p>Boundless landscapes in dreams, how can one bear to speak of the Han palace in this vast aeon? Since the departure of the lyricists of Lianchang, how many hearts have broken in the falling flower breeze? (Sun Longwei's "Dragon's Roar Grass" mostly concerns late Qing anecdotes; the "Ningshou Palace Lyrics" are especially worthy of succeeding the style of Mei Cun.)</p>
<p>Thinking of home in the sound of the jade flute, the old generation's elegance is impossible to surpass. People say Yang Hou's poems are good, depicting the wind and snow of Yumen with clouds. (Yang Yunshi's "Yunshi Tianshan Song" is 1932 characters long.)</p>
<p>The monk Tianhen had both wildness and immortal talent; he opened up the seven-character verse with a snap of his fingers. Winning praise and songs throughout the land, a monk arrives, sent by the waves of Dongting. (释寄禅)</p>
<p>Is it rain or cloud at dusk and dawn? Three lifetimes of karmic achievements are hard to erase. Spring brings heartbroken verses, sung across how many bridges adorned with cherry blossoms? (释曼殊)</p>
<p>The setting sun at the Wild History Pavilion is no longer the same; for ten years, I gathered the Wei herbs on Shouyang Mountain. Now I take the white-haired tears of the bronze immortal and blow them onto the clothes of the southern dynasty traveler. (金沧江, a Korean residing in Nantong)</p>
<p>The new school emphasizes the opening of the Xiushui; ten thousand waves rush to the sea, unleashing genius. Who can rival Wang Lang's strange words? Only Han Yu and Su Shi can be considered his peers. (王瑗仲, "Ten Thousand Waves," a seven-character verse by Yuanzhong observing the tide.)</p>
<p>Humble before Dongye, with Changli; a five-character verse, inscribed by my own hand. If you boast of good lines before others, you'll spend your life feeling the rice grow under the mountain. (My cousin Shen Zimao's poems have recently deliberately imitated Dongye's wildness; knowing the breadth of the shore, I feel the rice grow low under the mountain; this is an old line of his.)</p>
<p>How many people capture the spiritual energy of the landscape? Painfully chanting for long without rest. A thin flute, a mournful reed pipe – words from the gut. Is there not eternity within this?</p>

<h3>Methods of Utilizing Inert Gas in the Air</h3>
<p>— Worker</p>
<p>We all know that inert gas is a component of air. It occupies a great force in both construction and destruction. For example, proteins, which people need every day to maintain health, have it as a major ingredient. As for destruction, all modern explosives cannot do without it. However, its production is extremely small. Although it accounts for four-fifths of the air, there is no way to use it.</p>
<p>Until not long ago, a German, after a long period of research, invented a method to tap into the infinite riches. Now, let me introduce to you this method published by the German, Haber. But I want to state that utilizing inert gas from the air is not limited to this one method. There are also so-called direct combination methods, etc. Due to the limitations of my position, I will only introduce this one method.</p>
<p>First, the oxygen in the air is extracted. Then, the remaining inert gas is passed into a compound chamber. This chamber contains platinum powder as a catalyst. Then, carbon monoxide (Corbon Monxide) gas from the coal furnace is passed into water and transformed. The light gas generated during this transformation is also directed into the compound chamber. After this, the chamber door is tightly closed. One side is heated to 500 degrees (Celsius), and the gas pressure is increased to 200 atmospheres. Under these conditions, the inert gas and the light gas combine to form ammonia gas (NH3). This gas is then passed outside and further pressurized to become liquid for all practical uses.</p>

<h3>Summer Schools</h3>
<p>— Shadow Idiot</p>
<p>Summer is almost here. In recent days, the recruitment advertisements in the newspapers have been increasing day by day. At the same time, the advertisements selling education on the walls are also increasing. But in the newspapers, besides those recruitment advertisements, we have also found many summer schools, and the news that they will be opening soon.</p>
<p>It's really strange. When schools reach the summer vacation, on the one hand, they handle the closing events, and on the other hand, because the weather is too hot, it is not suitable for studying, so they have a two-month summer vacation. But during this summer vacation, the schools insist on opening summer schools. One moment, they're on summer vacation, the next moment, they're opening summer classes. It's like playing a game of hide-and-seek. Outsiders are naturally confused!</p>
<p>Is it possible that the end of a semester and the beginning of a semester can be done in three or several days? If that's the case, why have a long-term suspension of classes? If you want to have a vacation, why open school? If you say that the people running the schools are enthusiastic about education and are speeding up their work, then it would be better not to take this summer vacation and simply connect the two semesters, allowing students to study. Why bother having a summer vacation? It's really ridiculous.</p>
<p>In fact, there are reasons for running summer schools. Most private schools hire teachers and pay them by the hour. For these schools, the more vacation days, the better, because with the vacation, they can save a sum of teachers' salaries. At the same time, if there are more boarding students, they can save a lot of food expenses. With the vacation, the students will naturally go back immediately. Therefore, for these schools, one more vacation day is one day better. That is, summer vacation starts earlier than others and school starts later than others.</p>
<p>However, during the two-month-long summer vacation, although the teachers don't have to be paid, the rent, electricity, water bills, and the wages of the school workers cannot be saved at all, and must be paid the same as usual. Therefore, these school operators have discovered a good method, which is to open summer schools. Anyway, the classrooms, desks, and chairs are already there. Besides spending some advertising fees and extra salaries for the teachers, it doesn't cost much money. They are happy to do it.</p>
<p>From the teachers' own perspective, if the salaries of these private schools are calculated by the hour, they will naturally not get paid during the suspension of classes. Even if they are calculated by the month, they are mostly calculated for ten months. Being a teacher is originally the hardest thing to do. The monthly income is barely enough to cover the family's miscellaneous expenses, so where is there any extra money? So when they hear that the school is opening a summer school, they can naturally earn some extra money and avoid going into debt. Therefore, these teachers also extremely welcome the opening of summer schools.</p>
<p>If the purpose of running a school is to make money, then you must know how to dig and plan. If you don't know how to plan, you can't make money. School operators who know how to plan can make a lot of money by relying on summer schools.</p>

<h3>Dr. Jiang's Art</h3>
<p>— Man Qian</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang's clinic always presented a cold, quiet, and silent scene. Rarely, once every year or two, would one or two people visit to ask him for advice.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang, who was taught by the same teacher across the street, had a daily bustling scene, unable to attend to everyone. Everyone far and near knew the great name of "Dr. Jiang."</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang envied Dr. Jiang. One day, he couldn't help but ask his old classmate, Dr. Jiang, what skills he had gained more of from the teacher.</p>
<p>Dr. Jiang just smiled and said to him, "Old brother, you must understand that in this era, everyone wears a mask, but you still treat them with a sincere heart. How can a doctor who doesn't follow the trend not fail? To be honest with you, the skills I learned from the teacher are actually not as good as yours, but I have seen through the psychology of society, and now I will tell you, you might as well try it."</p>
<p>"First, the consultation fee must be set high, so that people will come to ask you for advice, because in today's society, people use the price as the standard for judging the quality of everything. Second, when someone comes to consult, you must put on airs and make them wait impatiently, no matter how free you actually are, because this can show that your business is busy. Third, when you arrive at the patient's home, you must show an extremely urgent appearance, as if there is no time to lose. As soon as your butt hits the stool, write the prescription. After writing the prescription, pick up your briefcase, say 'goodbye,' and leave. This can also make the patient know that there are really many people asking you to see a doctor. Fourth, you must describe the patient's illness as extremely serious, seemingly incurable. This way, if the patient gets better, it will show your medical skills are even more brilliant. Even if the patient dies, it will show that your judgment was correct. Finally, the prescriptions you write must choose the most expensive and heavy-flavored medicines. It's not a problem if they work, but if they don't work, it's good to let the patient know that since the doctor prescribed such heavy-flavored medicines, and they still didn't work, then it's predestined by fate! It's really beyond human help."</p>
