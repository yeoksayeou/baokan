<h3>外交危言翰</h3>
<p>大戰以後。國際關係之重心。已自大西洋而移於太平洋。我東北爲遠東之巴爾幹。爲國際未來慘劇之導火線。今已自中日之糾紛。進爲日美之糾紛。錦州失守之惡耗甫來。美國之照會隨至。其關係於我國利害果將何如乎。　　九一八之變吾不抵抗。而乞憐於虚僞之國聯。斤斤於正義與公道。其迂闊可知。夫正義爲玄學的名詞。而利害始爲國際關係之實質。德儒伊耶靈之言曰。［人而不能爲正當之防衛。則其人格何在。］康德之言日。［人而匍伏如蚯蚓。當不能怨艾他人之蹂躪。］最近法社會黨領袖蓬古爾演説。［世界和平之維持。當自本身自衛起。本自而不能自衞非但無以對自已。抑且無以對世界。］故乞援於毫無强制性之國聯。至於三度失敗。已足爲我最名貴之敎訓。</p>
<p>我國歷來無眞正之外交可言。無政策。無手段敷衍應付誠有如意前外相前駐華公使施渥若爵士所言。［中國外交。祇須顧全面子。斷送權利無傷。］斯言深堪體味。自大戰以後我外交當局。往往施弄小術小智在列强均勢下。謀苟延殘喘之續命湯列强亦樂以蜜詞飴我。俾迎合［顧全面子］的心理。故［領土完整］［門戶開放］等名詞。可公然錄於公約。我人亦從而附和之。殊不知此等名詞之裹面。爲列强之利益均沾。爲共管瓜分之種子。　　人聞美提引用九國公約之照。會而喜。吾反以之而憂。夫列强在華。均有地理的勢力範圍。而美則否。美之在華。其勢力爲經濟始終無勢力圈之保障。故其傅統的對華政策始終以約章的手段牽制列强的勢力圈。籍以維持以華之均勢。民十一年華盛頓之九國公約、即爲此政策之表現。惟美國爲商業化之國家。權衡利害。最爲審。愼非至萬一。决不出動。歐戰四年。美如加入。以軍力爲牟利最後之工具。日内瓦頭。雷芒湖畔。有美故總統威爾遜發起國聯之紀念碑。而美竟反汗拒絕參加。籍以維持其門羅主義之生命。故其行動。早爲人所共見。自暴日犯我東北以後。美國始終鄭重。以表示與國聯合作爲對日第一道防線此次錦州失守平津摇動於是始朝野相告。相驚伯有。日。［在華之均勢破矣。美之利益危矣。］於是始有史汀生之照會。以九國公約爲其對日之第二道防線。此防線是否能抵禦日本。尙爲一大擬問。我外交當局若欲引此照會爲國難之唯一救星。誠所謂其愚實不可及。</p>
<p>且也。最近消息。美照會發出後。歐方絕鮮應聲。表同情者惟比意兩國。比固無足輕重意亦僅希望仍得維持均勢爲已足。英尙猶豫。德亦旁觀。法更明白表示任美單獨行動。决不附和。而對手方之日本輿論。且譏此爲［虚僞之提議。］並謂門戶開放。機會均等早就聲明。决不因我覇據東北而打破。與美照會針鋒相對。洞穿美國難言之隠。此其手段。亦去辣矣。</p>
<p>我今敢掬。誠忠告我外交當局日。假使美照會而有效至多亦不過如從前之以毒攻毒］［以夷制夷。］藉列强之衡突牽制。圖爲國際間之寄生虫而已。革命外交云何哉。</p>

<p>不除庭齊談除草呋薈</p>
<h3>從燒煤爐談到敎育（下）</h3>
<p>然而茅草火却有它的用處。我今年學會了燒煤爐。先用些茅草或紙圑放在爐底，上面蓋一撮浮炭浮炭。是燒過的鬆木炭。次把茅草點着茅草變灰時，浮炭正是燒得通紅。次將烟煤放在浮炭上。浮炭變灰時，烟煤正是放出烈燄。最後將無烟煤蓋上。烟煤變灰時，無烟煤已是洋洋大火了。以後只須陸續將無烟煤加上，將煤灰取下·這滿爐的烈火，便可燒它一輩子也不致消滅。</p>
<p>這燒煤的過程便好比是敎育的過程·茅草燒浮炭·浮炭燒烟煤·烟煤燒無烟煤。這順序不可弄亂，弄亂了便是違背自然，勞而無功。專靠茅草燒火固然不可即：用茅草直接去燒無烟煤。也不行茅草燒成灰也不能把無焑煤燒着。中國有三種人··一種人是專用茅草放火：一種人是愛在茅草火上澆水：一種人是用茅草急急的去燒無烟煤。因此，中華民族的生命至今没有燒出不熄的火燄至今没有放出太陽般的光明。</p>
<p>敎育的使命是什麽不是放茅草火不是滅茅草火！是要依着燒煤的過程點着生命之火燄，放出生命之光明，中國敎育的使命是要依着燒煤的過程點着中華民族生命之火燄放出中華民族生命之光明。世界敎育之使命也是要依着燒煤的過程點着全人類生命之火燄，放出全人類生命之光明。</p>
<h3>吳祿貞出賣順風</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>吳中玄妙觀前之陸稿薦。爲聞名江浙之熟肉舗。有所謂順風者。刴豚兒之耳爲之也吳祿貞將軍非屠夫之流。烏有順風之出賣。蓋將軍嘗一怒。抽白刃刴倭奴之耳也。時祿貞任延吉邊務大臣。嚴厲剛正。一時無兩。東省之倭僑。俱震大名。不敢稍攖其鋒。一日。有倭領事來謁見者。停車門外祿貞之委員。命車夫移止道左。俾不致有礙交通車夫不知其爲委員也。揮鞭辱之。委員固擅倭語者。斷斷與爭。車夫復鞭之。盛氣以凌且加甚焉。委員不得已。上禀於祿貞。祿責大怒。立命執無禮車夫來。提其左耳。親用短刃刴之。血涔涔下滴。衣肩爲之殷紅。車夫痛踣於地。領事詰問。祿貞叱之日。若再不識趣而喋喋者車夫之右耳又將失其位置矣領事氣奪不敢聲。一時傅爲話柄。按祿貞號綬卿。富革命思想。光復之際。祿貞頗多規晝清廷忌之。狙擊之於石家莊。一代雄才長埋黄土。惜哉祿貞工呤詠。詩什綦多如步王梧生已酉守歲原韻云。梭擲雙丸任往還。白雲終古自閑閑。一生梯米浮滄海。萬里風雲望故山。醉眼重邀燕市月。蹄痕曾遍漢時關。撫摩髀肉增惆悵。陳迹無端俯仰間。底事王郎斫</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>一萬餘元一張照片拍一張照片。似乎是很平常的事情。不比是繪晝或雕刻。可以得到較大的代價。不料最近竟有一張照片。共得墨銀一萬餘元之多。此人是英國孟吉斯德Ｍａｎｃｂｏｓｔｅｒ地方一個少年織工。名却爾斯鮑惠爾。ＣｂａｒｌｅｓＰｏｗｅｌｌ他在人島ｌｓｌｅｏｆＭａｎ一個山岩上給他的未婚妻拍了一張照。恰值照片大比賽會開會。他將這照片送去。不料結果竟列在第一柯逹的全世界照片比賽中。他也得了個一部分的獎金一百金鎊。那全國比賽的奬金是一千金鎊。合墨銀約一萬餘元並又得了一件額外的獎品銀像一座。據說此次比賽。由世界各地所投寄的照片。計有三百萬件之多。加入的國家共四十七國。由八國的代表共同評判。評判的結果。終於給鮑威爾獨占鰲頭。（參看今日本報圖晝周刋第四頁［</p>
<p>雲水蒼茫］照片）</p>
<p>地歌。敢將身世怨蹉跎。骨經鍜鍊丰裁峻。眼閲興亡涕涙多。好友乍來棋一著。舊書補讀硯重磨。揭來五夜閑呤慣。數盡殘更躍鼓　。又聯句云·官閣梅花春酒艷。天階楊柳曉風疏。又五夜聞鷄猶起舞。一時屠狗亦雄飛。又長安觀奕成殘局。列國爭雄啓戰塲。又未必出山終小草。何辭傾國對名花。均名雋高華之作。讀之動人景慕。精神不死。祿貞有也。</p>
<h3>馮玉祥軼事</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>久棲田野之馮玉祥氏。鑒於國事危急。專車南下。與亦京滬各要人。共籌救國大計。抵滬之日。衆覩馮氏短襖腰帶。手挟棉布外衣。有携車牽羊之甘地風。茲錄其片段軼事。以供談助。</p>
<p>馮氏糼失怙恃而家貧如洗。不能自活。時滿清末葉。各省設常備軍。文事武備。兼爲施敎。馮氏遂投身其中。以刻苦勤愼爲上峯所重。其地位遂因此漸漸升遷焉。丙寅豫軍犯陕陕。軍據城堅守。相持不下者八月。陕軍無援糧秣漸盡。予輩在城中。日以麥皮油渣果腹。殆後麥皮油渣。亦成珍品。長安城中。死亡枕藉。忽一日遠處聞砲聲甚急。翌晨城圍遂解。人報馮玉祥軍來。已擊退豫軍矣。其用兵神速若是。而城中數十萬軍民。得以復活者。馮之力也。</p>
<p>馮氏主陕政時。秦省綢緞裝飾等業。生意極爲清淡。蓋其提倡節儉。以身作則。布衣蔬食。即宴客不過加肉肴一二簋。陕軍師長吳新田氏常語人曰。［子寗願博負</p>
<p>二百元。不願食馮玉祥一頓飯］此語一時遂傅爲笑柄云。</p>
<h3>記暝琴館晝梅</h3>
<p>— 雄村</p>
<p>佘子盛明。精金石之學。曩走湘。獲丁佘敬身所治磁章。文日暝琴。因以名其館。志喜也。盛明於治印之外。並工書晝。與向蔗公稱蜀中二傑。初頗自矝於鐵筆。及見蔗公。歎爲鈍丁之繼。舉世無其匹。遂棄厥業。壹志畫梅卒成一代高手。張子大千。海内名晝師也見盛明所作梅花。妍澹無跡。斂手推服。嘗語人曰。蔗公治印。儼然鈍丁。盛明畫梅。直是巢林。盛明梅幅。鈴以蔗公之章。庶爲難并。其傾倒二子。可謂極矣。會盛明游嘉善。遂以蔗公之介。與大千訂交三子皆蜀產。並耽於畫。志同道合。縱談忘寢有時興至。大千奮筆作古松。蟠屈矯變蔗公潑墨繪竹。目送手揮。通神窮態。而盛明補梅以總其成。往往一夕盡十數紙。不以爲倦。</p>
<h3>睇嚮齊逞談</h3>
<p>— 朱祖謀</p>
<p>清亡。遺臣之隠居者。大抵視夷塲爲安樂窩。北之津沽南之淞滬。殊多遺老之足跡。廿年清之間漸凋謝。頃朱祖謀又以物化聞。先正典型。將不可復覩矣祖謀字古微亦字漚尹。復字疆邨。初名孝藏。以避廟諱昜祖謀。浙江吳興人。癸未以二甲第一名及第。授編修。爲書仿顏魯公而肖。當會試時。戶部尙書閻敬銘之子字亦模顏。視祖謀如出一手。主考欲媚閻。閲卷置前茅。拆封視之。蓋祖謀也。嗣由待讀學士擢禮部待郎。出督廣東學政乞病歸。僑居吳門。與鄭叔問（焯）塡詞自遣。宣統踐位。起爲典禮院顧問大臣。未之官。庚子拳匪之禍。慈禧太后召百官入覲。命各據所見。祖謀應聲曰。皇太后蔽奸黨。恃亂徒。以敵外國。是誠何心哉。今危機已迫。將以何人了之。后曰。董福祥知兵善戰。可勝其任。福祥昏庸老邁。如何可恃。后正色日。祖謀操南方語予莫解。及退。后猶怒目送之。衆以爲必獲嚴譴。其後后偶對人言。以祖謀雖赿級言事。而忠誠可取比歲居滬。詞人以祖謀爲當代詞宗。組漚社奉爲盟主。一二不肖者震其名。請托得置身其間。祖謀雖鄙其爲人。而莫之拒。則長者忠厚之度不可及也。垂死前五日。譜詞一闋。凄惋欲絕。最後之筆也。卒年七十五。</p>
<p>盛明興致尤豪。輒獨自畫梅若干幅。盡興始止。粉色黛痕。應有盡有。白描墨暈。各極其工積日旣久。所作益多。茲於一月九日起假嘉善圖書館展覽兩天。世有知音。作風當爲一變看雲樓主語余。朱古微待郎曩見盛明墨梅謂能傅其孤高之性。再三慫恿。展覽作品盛明唯唯否否。今展覽有期。而待郎遽逝。卒不得見傷巳。（移酬助賑）</p>
<h3>出征</h3>
<p>— 青年援馬圑一圑員</p>
<p>（十）京滬段總結（上）</p>
<p>我們從七日上午自上海起程。至十八日下午才到南京。在這十一天之内。我們蒞遍了全個京滬路的大都市。使我們欣慰而奮勵的。莫如各處民衆都有一種救國的决心。尤其是青年學生們·寗忍飢受寒地而四出呼號。這般苦心。的是令人感慨歌頌。祇可惜把這可貴的光陰。蒙爽地便把它放了去。</p>
<p>我們自出發以來。蒙各處同胞歡迎歡送。並勞慰問。訓勉。及賜給旗幟費用。食物等等甚多。我們感受之餘。謹待將來殺敵贖罪。常州及鎭江兩地各送我們一柄大刀。（像從前奉軍大刀隊所用的一樣（鋒利無比。出鞘一看。寒光照人。極能增進壯士的勇氣。</p>
<p>我們自上海連日步行至崑山時。全個隊伍的精神仍能維持原狀。尤難能而可貴的。即女同志們也十分英武地。毫無疲倦地。仍舊放開大步向前勇進。這眞的愧煞無數的鬚眉男子了。</p>
<p>我們本來决意徒步往目的地的。嗣因路局誠懇地勸告。說是恐激起沿途民衆的愛國熱浪。我們也很希望［安内攘外］的國運成功。因此便接受當局者的好意。自崑山起均乘車進行。</p>
<h3>小言</h3>
<p>— 笑如</p>
<p>内戰起來則兩不相讓各盡全力抵抗。</p>
<p>現在錦州已失守了。倭奴勢燄。日甚一日。更將進攻山海關。眼石着山河破碎地圖變色。亡國慘禍。迫於目前。一個個却依然我推着你。你推着他。爭執私見。互相責難。不一致奮起速謀抵抗。往日内戰時的威風。不知道到那裹去了。　　有人說。［勇於私鬥］。是中國人生就的劣根性。無法解除的。我說。有這種劣根性的。倒並不是中國人。因爲果眞是中國人。倒知道爲自已的中國打算了。（却酬）</p>

<h3>麵粉午後忽轉俏勢</h3>

<p>昨日紛市、上午開盤後、各月份呈疲滯之象、較前日收價小去五厘左右、旋因抛戶甚　、買方堅定更以迅證大部分均已繳納、其力量彷彿又健、故開價步穏、迨至下午開盤初尙平長、後因華日國交之轉惡、一般神經過敏者、淡悉洋　到頭受阻、小廠遂多抵進、故近遠期忽呈俏勢結果本月份較前日漲一分七厘半、二月份大二分、三月份大二分半、四五月份大二分二厘半、六月份大二分云、</p>

<p>注意破壞愛國運動的陰謀幸·</p>
<p>日來本埠發現一種小册子、標題是［眞正的救國方法］，據說這小册是有人在深夜裹挨戶散發的。</p>
<p>册子的内容是反對抗日救國會，所謂眞正的救國方法，也就是打倒抗日救國會，拒絕抗日救國會的檢查。裹面列舉的五項辦法是··㈠報告捕房提出公訴，㈡同業結合同區結合··㈢呈請法院解散抗日救國會··㈣呈請捕戶取締抗日救國會；㈤呈請政府禁止抗日救國會。這册子没有人署名，也没有發行處，很顯然的這是一枝陰毒的暗箭，是一種毒辣的陰謀。</p>
<p>我懐疑散發這小册子的是日本人，因爲排貨運動是日本的一種致命打擊，日本曾經三翻四次要求我政府取締。同時我又懐疑幹這勾當的是本埠的賣國奸商，因爲排貨運動也確實給予靠販［日</p>
<p>貨］發財的奸商以許多的不利。姑無論是日本人幹的，或者是賣國的漢奸幹的，但這小册子的用意是爲着想破壞排貨運動，則毫無可疑。假使幹這鬼蜮技倆的是日本人，自愈益顯示其心慌膽怯，適足以增加我們排貨的毅力與决心。假使幹這破壞愛國運動的勾當的是我們自已的人，那便眞是國人的公敵，民族的叛逆，罪不容於死。</p>
<p>商界的同胞們應認定排斥日貨是我們抗暴自救最後僅存的武器，也就是一種最切實最有效的方法，在日本未停止對我們的侵略之前，這武器决不能放鬆，應認清這種破壞愛國運動的陰謀，注意自已不要爲這種喪失了性靈的胡言所朦惑。有國才有家救家先救國，排斥日貨是救國而販賣日貨至多只有自已一家賺得些的利潤輕重得失，大家應存細認清。</p>

<h3>上海故事（三）</h3>
<p>吳淞口外之第一砲</p>
<p>林德色在他的［阿墨斯特號</p>
<p>航行中國北方口岸］那一篇報告書之中，極力稱讚上海爲一個最優等的商業入口，可是東印度公司却漢然視之，當時的英國人，决定以舟山羣島爲英國對華貿昜的中心地，對於上海尙未曾感到　的重要，</p>
<p>自從道光二十年鴉片戰爭開始之後吳淞口外聽見子第一聲砲響帮，才驚醒了沉睡着的司方地土，上海的新的命運才開始降臨，這種新的命運是禍是福，現在我們還不敢斷定，不過僅只爲上海設想，英國兵艦的破天荒的砲聲，把牠的窮苦不堪的命運打斷，走上繁華富麗的新運，未嘗不是上海之福，但是［福無</p>
<p>雙至，禍不單行］，從此以後的上海變成遠東的幸福的魔窟了。</p>
<p>道光二十二年（公曆一八四二年），英將威廉派克與臥鳥古統率陸軍四千人，由厦門而寗波而乍浦，相繼攻陷，於六月十三日直抵吳淞口。</p>
<h3>一塲血戰</h3>
<p>上海官史對於海防，事先並無準備，一旦發覺英軍有進攻上海之勢，於急忙之中，盡力防禦，增修吳淞口兩岸的砲臺，並沿大江修築土堤，自吳淞至寳山縣，長凡三英哩。收集土砲鳥槍短銃，準備迎戰，</p>
<p>除了緣營兵士之外並臨時招募圑勇，當時有河南徐州江寗兵三千人，藤牌兵八百，但是久無訓練軍備也不充實。兵力薄弱，不言而喩，最有趣的一件事，是發明了用水車縛在沙船兩旁，用人力踏動車輪，鼓浪而進，每小時却也可以行三英哩。</p>
<p>英國艦隊，因水道不熟進行極慢至六月十六日拂曉，英人用汽船拖曳兵艦前進，迫近我軍，相距不過五百碼左右，這時候，我軍統砲齊發，洞穿英艦三艘，射殺三人，傷數人，卒以器械不精，我國大敗，英兵遂登陸，直入寳山，我軍向蘇州撤退，這一塲血戰，上海軍民以及官吏，莫不奮勇拒抗，結果死者二百餘人，傷者無數。</p>
<h3>上海失陷</h3>
<p>英兵艦駛入蘇州河，抵新閘橋，陸軍上岸，進佔縣城，城内兵卒極少，稍加拒抗，即刻退出，城内秩序大亂，人民紛紛出城逃避，流氓乘機搶掠，英軍亦大肆搜刦，十屋九空爲上海近百年來第一次大刦，</p>

<h3>The US Government Still Maintains its Former Attitude</h3>
<p>Even if No Other Country Collaborates</p>
<p>It will Still Take Firm Action</p>
<p>(Washington) Official circles here indicated in talks today their determination that, even if no other country cooperates, they will firmly warn China and Japan to respect American treaty rights in Manchuria. Official circles, in conversations with Reuters reporters, stated that the current attitude of the State Department is exactly the same as the attitude of the United States when Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to China in 1915. However, the actions taken by the United States do not represent a withdrawal from cooperation with the League of Nations. According to reports from London and Paris, neither Britain nor France is prepared to adopt the American attitude toward Manchuria. Both London and Paris believe that the United States is in a different position because the United States is not a member of the League of Nations. British comments refer to Japan's support for the Open Door policy in Manchuria, while French comments state that France will use Geneva to exert its moderating influence. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>The Attitudes of Britain, Italy, France, and Belgium</h3>
<p>Today, the Associated Press in Rome learned from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Italy is planning to formally express its support for the American note to China and Japan in the near future. It is claimed that Italy's interests in the Far East are concentrated in the Tianjin area. The Italian government believes that maintaining the balance of power in the Manchurian issue is sufficient. However, Italy considers the protection of Catholic missionaries in China to be more important than Belgian commercial interests. A few Catholic missionaries were recently murdered by bandits, so Italy is extremely eager to see peace and tranquility in China. As for France's attitude toward the American note, according to news from Paris today, French foreign ministry officials declared that France would not follow the United States' lead in presenting the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact to China and Japan. When the US government notified the French government that it would issue the note, France had already decided to allow the United States to act alone. In addition, Britain's attitude has not yet been decided, but Belgium has already expressed its support. Therefore, so far, only Italy and Belgium have clearly expressed their alignment with the United States. Britain is expected to make a decision soon. Furthermore, news from Geneva indicates that League of Nations members are unwilling to comment on the Chinese government's decision to invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant at this time. It is said that before China takes any further formal action, this American note is the strongest action since the outbreak of the Liaoning Incident. Therefore, League of Nations members want to wait and see the results. As for what the results will be if China obtains Article 16 of the Covenant after the League of Nations Council meeting on January 25, the Council will be able to make a quick decision. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Position Differs from the US</h3>
<p>London learned tonight that the Foreign Office has received a copy of the American note to Japan. This note invokes the clause in the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 that guarantees China's territorial integrity. The British opinion on this note will be conveyed to the United States by the ambassador to the United States, and the British government's direct note to the Japanese government is also expected. Britain's position is not entirely the same as that of the United States because the United States is not a member of the League of Nations. During the last meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council in Paris, the Japanese representative told the British representative that, regardless of its military policy in Manchuria, Japan supports the Open Door policy in Manchuria and mainland China. The entire incident has now turned into an issue of the interpretation of the Nine-Power Treaty between countries. The signatories to this treaty are the United States, Britain, Belgium, China, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Portugal. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>France Intends to Use the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Paris) Diplomatic circles here pointed out today that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute has been entrusted to the League of Nations, so France's moderating influence will mostly be exerted through Geneva. A reliable source issued an article tonight denying the claim that Britain and France intend to endorse American intervention in the Manchurian incident, saying that the United States has extremely important interests in China and, for the sake of prudence, cannot consider the situation violating the Nine-Power Treaty and the obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact as a fait accompli. European powers' foreign policies are constrained by certain considerations, while American foreign policy is not bound by these considerations because the United States is not a member of the League of Nations. The French government has received notification of the American note to Japan, but it is currently unable to change its attitude. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Praise the Strong Note</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, American newspapers generally praised Stimson's strong note to China and Japan, with many words of praise. The New York Evening Sun commented that Stimson's move not only protested but also asked China and Japan to pay attention to their obligations, which can be said to be profound. The New York World Telegram said that Stimson regrettably did not list the treaty interests of the United States that have been violated in the note. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>New York New York and Washington news circles and officialdom value the trend of the American note to Japan. It is widely seen as a regrettable event. New York newspapers, especially the Tribune, strongly stated today that this note should not be regarded as an unfriendly posture on the part of the United States toward Japan. They also said that the inevitable reaction from the United States this time will inevitably set a bad example in the East that Japan has never done before. The positive impact that this note will inevitably have in China after its publication is also what New York newspapers are aiming for. Newspapers do not expect Britain and France to agree to Stimson's move. American newspapers also said that Japan's future reaction may be to ignore American public opinion, and the obvious crisis arising therefrom will not be mitigated by the extravagant interpretation that the United States is currently adding to the matter. The current position of the State Department does help people have this interpretation. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers' Opinions Vary</h3>
<p>London Today, the opinions on the American note to Japan from London newspapers vary. The Daily Mail stated that our responsibility is to state frankly and practically that the British people will not allow themselves to be drawn into a war with Japan under any circumstances. If the Japanese army withdraws from Manchuria, the culture will be in danger. The Daily Telegraph stated that the American note cannot be regarded as American intervention. The United States only wants to warn Japan not to forget or despise its rights. The Morning Post stated that if Japan maintains the Open Door policy in Manchuria, then there is no reason to criticize the change of national management. If China can establish the reputation of its government, as its people enjoy in commerce and art, and if China can eliminate bandits and govern its country on its own, then Japan or other countries will have no excuse to violate its territorial integrity. The Daily Express stated that Japan shamelessly destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty in every possible way in the past three months. There is no doubt that the United States' initiative will be rewarded. Are Britain and the League of Nations now prepared to receive this clear lesson and take the actions they should have taken earlier? The Daily Sketch advocated calmness, saying that the United States will not go to war because the poor political turmoil in Manchuria is now being easily replaced by Japan's order. The Daily Express stated that no one expects the United States or other countries or the League of Nations to do anything. This matter will end, face will be saved, and Japan will concentrate on its work of suppressing Manchuria. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Mock the American Note</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Nichinichi Shimbun said, "What has China done in Manchuria? Nothing." This statement can summarize the general Japanese reaction to the American claim that Japan has destroyed the last remaining governance of the Republic of China in South Manchuria. The Japanese said that Nanjing has never exercised its governance in South Manchuria. Zhang Xueliang only verbally obeyed Nanjing. Nanjing gave him a free hand and never interfered, so it cannot be said that Japan has destroyed China's territorial integrity. The Japanese here believe that, in this regard, the American note is based on a false premise. As for the American concern that Japan's actions will hinder American rights, the Japanese believe that there is no reason for this, because Japan has repeatedly stated that it has no territorial ambitions and does not intend to abandon the Open Door policy and the principle of equal opportunity. The Japanese further argued that if Japan restores peace and order in Manchuria by eliminating bandits and eradicating bad politics, then the Open Door principle will be more stable rather than destroyed. Tokyo residents also greatly criticized the American non-recognition of any de facto situation, pointing out that it contains the meaning of not recognizing the right of the people of Manchuria to replace the government under warlord rule with a government that can vigorously implement loyal politics, and not respecting treaty obligations, resulting in the current situation. Although official circles do not want to criticize the American note, after careful consideration, they feel that the United States does not really want to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty, but only wants to remind Japan of its obligations under the treaty. Japanese official circles also believe that the United States wants to adopt preventive measures to show its attitude before there is any development that could harm American interests, as it did in 1921 after Japan occupied Sakhalin Island. A spokesman for the Japanese officialdom said that the United States seems to be worried that Japan will establish a puppet government in Manchuria so that it can demand special interests from it. It should be known that the United States can rest assured that Japan will not be so reckless as to recognize a puppet Manchurian government, as Roosevelt did with Panama. This statement contains a hint of mockery. The spokesman also said that if the United States is so concerned about the destruction of China's administrative integrity in Manchuria, then why doesn't the United States protest what the Soviet Union is doing in Mongolia and Xinjiang, or what Britain is doing in Tibet? Japanese newspapers all expressed the same meaning, comparing Japan's actions in Manchuria to the United States' actions in Nicaragua and Guatemala, saying that Japan's only purpose is to ensure peace and order and respect legitimate rights. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to remarks from Tokyo official circles, if a meeting is held to discuss the application of the Nine-Power Treaty to the current situation in Manchuria, then Japan may propose to amend this treaty, because the phrase "China's administrative integrity" in the original treaty has never been clearly defined, resulting in divergent interpretations. Therefore, it is felt that it is necessary to explain it to dispel existing doubts and avoid causing misunderstandings. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain No Longer Sends a Note to Japan</h3>
<p>The British Foreign Office announced today that, because of the declaration made by the Japanese representative in Geneva on October 13 and because of the Japanese Prime Minister's announcement on December 28 that Japan would abide by the Open Door policy in Manchuria, it is believed that it is not necessary to send any formal note to the Japanese government similar to the one already issued by the United States. However, the Japanese ambassador in London has been asked to seek confirmation of this guarantee from his government. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Value the American Attitude</h3>
<p>London According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, the news of the United States invoking the Nine-Power Treaty is highly valued by German newspapers. The Vossische Zeitung stated that if Japan continues to use force under the necessity of protecting the South Manchurian Railway, then it is undoubtedly committing the crime of violating the treaty. However, the American note may not have a far-reaching effect unless the League of Nations Administrative Council acts under Article 15 of the Covenant. According to this article, member states retain the right to take any action they deem necessary to maintain justice and fairness. If Japan violates the Nine-Power Treaty, it is indeed establishing the crime of using war as an instrument of its national policy, then the position of the League of Nations will be stronger. The Kreuzzeitung stated that Japan's China policy may not change because of this American move. If Japan changes its policy, it will greatly damage its prestige. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berliner Tageblatt reported that the resignation of the Japanese cabinet was likely due to the American action, but Tokyo may try to make people believe that it was due to the assassination of the Emperor. This is also possible because the Japanese cabinet is responsible for the Emperor's life, and there is a tradition of resigning and retiring when similar cases occur. However, after the note from US Secretary of State Stimson was delivered, the Japanese cabinet did not have to think about maintaining power. Its resignation is a sign that a new situation has occurred, and the militaristic Japan feels uncomfortable in this new situation. The Sozialistische Arbeiter-Zeitung reported that the American move was too late, or perhaps too late. However, we are satisfied because it is better than an international joke. It is a question whether the Tokyo government can feel the influence of Washington's awakening so late. It is to be hoped that Japan will be moved. Unfortunately, the initial news from Tokyo said that people there are still strong. If the American move is despised like this, the American government may not ignore it, then the future development is not without fear. In short, the future of the Far East is very dangerous, and there are many unexpected troubles that are worrying. This is undeniably true. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>yang and other places on September 18 of last year, they have used violence to instigate traitors and unscrupulous elements to organize illegal institutions and seize political power. The Foreign Ministry had previously instructed the League of Nations representatives and foreign ambassadors to formally declare to the League of Nations and the governments of various countries that the Chinese government does not recognize all illegal organizations. Recently, the Japanese established a fake Northeast Transportation Committee in Shenyang, with Ding Jiansiu as chairman and Jin Bidong as deputy, and drafted a charter, oath, and statement of purpose to seize the full power of transportation in the Northeast. The Foreign Ministry has notified Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu, declaring that the Chinese government absolutely cannot recognize this illegal organization, and all its facilities will naturally have no effect.

As for the meeting of North China generals in Beiping, it was to discuss foreign affairs, and everyone shared a common hatred of the enemy. Zhang Xueliang was forced to abandon Jinzhou, but he should be prepared for Yuguan. He believes the situation can be managed, as long as everyone works hard and does not be pessimistic. Although Japan has occupied the Northeast and gained greatly, its international moral loss is even greater.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Alarms</h3>
<p>Since the Great War, the center of gravity of international relations has shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Our Northeast is the Balkans of the Far East, the fuse for future international tragedies. It has now progressed from a Sino-Japanese dispute to a Japanese-American dispute. The bad news of the fall of Jinzhou has just arrived, and the American note has followed. What will its impact on our national interests be?</p>
<p>On September 18th, we did not resist and begged for pity from the hypocritical League of Nations, focusing on justice and fairness. Its impracticality is evident. Justice is a metaphysical term, while interests are the essence of international relations. The German scholar Ihering said, "If a person cannot defend himself properly, what is his personality?" Kant said, "If a person crawls like an earthworm, he cannot complain about being trampled upon by others." Recently, the leader of the French Socialist Party, Paul Boncour, said in a speech, "The maintenance of world peace must start with self-defense. If one cannot defend oneself, not only is there no way to face oneself, but there is also no way to face the world." Therefore, relying on the League of Nations, which has no coercive power, and failing three times, is enough to be our most valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Our country has never had true diplomacy. Without policy or means, dealing with problems superficially is just as former Foreign Minister and former Ambassador to China, Sir John Jordan, said: "Chinese diplomacy only needs to save face and losing rights doesn't matter." These words are deeply insightful. Since the Great War, our diplomatic authorities have often used petty tricks and intelligence to seek a temporary respite under the balance of power of the great powers. The great powers are also happy to appease us with honeyed words to cater to the psychology of "saving face." Therefore, terms such as "territorial integrity" and "open door" can be publicly recorded in conventions. Our people also echo them, but they do not know that behind these terms is the equal distribution of benefits among the great powers, the seeds of joint management and division. People hear the news of the US invoking the Nine-Power Treaty and rejoice. I am worried about it. The great powers in China all have geographical spheres of influence, but the US does not. The US in China, its strength is economic, and it has never had the guarantee of a sphere of influence. Therefore, its traditional policy towards China has always been to use treaty means to restrain the spheres of influence of the great powers, in order to maintain the balance of power in China. The Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 was a manifestation of this policy. However, the US is a commercialized country, and it is most cautious in weighing the pros and cons. It will not act unless it is absolutely necessary. In the four years of the European War, the US joined to use military power as the ultimate tool for profit. On the shores of Lake Geneva, there is a monument commemorating the League of Nations initiated by former US President Wilson, but the US refused to participate in order to maintain the life of its Monroe Doctrine. Therefore, its actions have long been known to all. Since Japan invaded our Northeast, the US has always been solemn, expressing cooperation with the League of Nations as the first line of defense against Japan. This time, with the fall of Jinzhou and the shaking of Beiping and Tianjin, the government and the public informed and frightened each other, saying, "The balance of power in China has been broken, and the interests of the US are in danger." Therefore, there was the Stimson Note, using the Nine-Power Treaty as its second line of defense against Japan. Whether this line of defense can resist Japan is still a big question. If our diplomatic authorities want to use this note as the only savior of the national crisis, it is truly foolish.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to recent news, after the US note was issued, European countries were rarely heard responding. Only Belgium and Italy expressed sympathy. Belgium is insignificant, and Italy only hopes to maintain the balance of power. Britain is still hesitant, Germany is also watching, and France has made it clear that it will let the US act alone and will not support it. On the other hand, Japanese public opinion mocks this as a "hypocritical proposal" and says that the open door and equal opportunity have long been declared and will not be broken because of our hegemony in the Northeast, countering the US note head-on, exposing the unspoken secrets of the US. This method is also very spicy.</p>
<p>Today, I dare to offer a sincere piece of advice to our diplomatic authorities: Even if the US note is effective, at most it will only be like "using poison to fight poison" and "using barbarians to control barbarians," relying on the conflicts and restraints of the great powers, trying to be a parasite in the international community. What is revolutionary diplomacy?</p>

<h3>Bai Lianyin Resigns as Foreign Minister Due to Illness</h3>
<p>The Government Asks Him to Serve as a Minister Without Portfolio</p>
<p>There Are Rumors That the Laval Cabinet Will Be Reorganized</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 9th – Bai Lianyin has resigned from his position as Foreign Minister due to illness. Prime Minister Laval is currently looking for a replacement, but it is not easy to find one. The Lausanne reparations conference and the Geneva disarmament conference are about to open, and France must also deal cautiously with the Sino-Japanese dispute. Only someone with great talent can handle it.</p>
<p>▲ National News, Paris, 9th – The government has approved the resignation of French Foreign Minister Bai Lianyin. He will resign his responsibilities tomorrow. However, Laval has asked him to remain as a minister without portfolio in the capacity of a permanent representative to the League of Nations Council. It is not yet certain whether Bai will accept. However, considering that Bai has stated that he cannot bear the burden of future international conferences, it is feared that he may not be able to accept this either.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 9th – Since the position of Minister of the Army, Maginot, has recently become vacant, and Foreign Minister Bai Lianyin has resigned due to illness, there are rumors that the Laval cabinet will be reorganized. It is said that the cabinet will resign en masse next Tuesday. If so, the reparations conference and the disarmament conference may be postponed.</p>
<h3>Inukai Cabinet Retains Office</h3>
<p>Only the Police Commissioner Sacrificed</p>
<p>Due to the Power of Saionji's Words</p>
<p>The Minzheng Party Plans to Impeach the Government</p>
<p>▲ National News, Tokyo, 9th – After an emergency cabinet meeting this morning, the Japanese cabinet decided to abide by the Emperor's edict and remain in office as a whole. The Japanese cabinet resigned yesterday afternoon due to the assassination attempt on the Emperor by Korean Lee Bong-chang. The Emperor immediately sent Minister of the Imperial Household Suzuki to Okitsu to consult with elder statesman Saionji. Saionji argued that the situation was serious and that the cabinet should not be changed. After Suzuki reported back, the Emperor summoned Inukai Tsuyoshi to the palace this morning and ordered him to serve with peace of mind and not to resign. Thereupon, the cabinet immediately held an emergency meeting and decided on its attitude. At 1:22 p.m., Inukai Tsuyoshi again entered the palace to report on the situation of remaining in office in compliance with the imperial order. Initially, it was expected that Minister of Home Affairs Nakahashi would resign to take responsibility, and it was feared that Army Minister Araki would not stay either. Subsequently, the Emperor ordered all cabinet members to continue to serve as usual, so they all stayed. However, the Police Commissioner has been dismissed and the police department clerk has been demoted. In addition, local officials in the hometown of Korean Lee Bong-chang will also be punished. As for diplomatic officials such as the Parliamentary Vice-Minister, those who resigned to take responsibility have now withdrawn their resignations and have been ordered to continue to serve as usual.</p>
<p>Japanese League News, Tokyo, 9th – After the assassination attempt on the Emperor, the Minzheng Party has paid close attention to the government's attitude. According to a party member, Prime Minister Inukai should clarify his responsibility based on the principles of constitutional government and national morality, and fulfill his duties as a subject. Therefore, even if he receives the Emperor's order to remain in office, he should resign, otherwise we will severely criticize the Prime Minister's responsibility. The method is to first submit it to the parliament as an important issue, advocate that the Prime Minister take responsibility, and impeach the government through resolutions and other methods.</p>
<h3>Dawes Is Tired of Political Life</h3>
<p>After the Disarmament Conference Closes</p>
<p>Plans to Return to Banking</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 8th – U.S. Ambassador to London, General Dawes, announced today that after participating in the Disarmament Conference, he plans to resign and return to Chicago to resume banking. Dawes is the chairman of the U.S. delegation to the Disarmament Conference. As a soldier, banker, and diplomat, the Dawes Plan for German reparations, implemented in September 1925, was his creation. In 1925, he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the then British Foreign Secretary Chamberlain. He has also written many books. Dawes' resignation is significant from a political point of view, as it was rumored a few weeks ago that a group within the Republican Party intended to nominate Dawes as a presidential candidate to replace Hoover. Dawes has now left Washington for Chicago and is scheduled to depart for Geneva on January 20.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New York, 9th – Since Dawes announced his intention to resign as Ambassador to the United Kingdom, several candidates have been proposed. One is Houghton, who served as Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1925 to 1928, and then resigned to run as a Republican candidate for Senator from New York. One is the current Ambassador to France, Edge, and one is the current Secretary of the Treasury, Mellon, as well as Senator Reed.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 9th – Germany's request to abolish reparations will be made at the Lausanne Reparations Conference.

The German position is that if the world's economic life is to be restored, Germany is unable to pay reparations today or in the future. Responsible parties here said that if Germany is required to pay reparations when the Hoover Moratorium expires, Germany's economic life will be completely overturned. But if Germany is permanently exempted from the burden of reparations, Germany will be able to pay private debts on schedule in the future.</p>
<h3>Hindenburg's Re-election Issue, the Attitude of the German Social Democratic Party Is Unclear</h3>
<p>▲ National News, Berlin, 9th – Hitler originally planned to respond to Chancellor Brüning today regarding the National Socialist Party's attitude towards President Hindenburg's extension of term, but now the answer will be postponed. According to the National Socialist Party, Herr Hee must leave Berlin for twenty-four hours on business, and may not be able to return before noon on Sunday. However, German political circles believe that Hee's departure from Berlin is just an excuse to delay the answer until Monday, as the party wants to wait for the results of tomorrow's local elections in Lippstadt before answering. However, Herr Hee's reply has a significant impact on the direction of domestic affairs, so all parties are speculating about it, and the party is tight-lipped. Even the news agency that usually spreads the party's news has nothing to announce.</p>

China is facing a sea of joy, but the country is in danger, and diplomacy is difficult. The day the unified government was established was the time when Japan attacked and occupied Jinzhou. If they were to deal with relations with our country, they would leave some room, but they would not dare to do this. Now they despise everything and treat us as if we are about to perish. Such shame is unbearable. Moreover, the Northeast is the gateway to our country and is of great importance. If the shield is lost, the whole country will perish.

<h3>Receiving Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>To the League of Nations, seeking the sanctions of justice. Now the motion has failed, and the powers are standing by, and Japan's ambitions are growing, intensifying. Recently, they have increased their troops in Tianjin and are continuing to invade North China. The situation is precarious. At this time when the country is about to perish, if our people have a breath left, we can only have the determination to seek life in death. We should unite and vow to resist to the death the Japanese, who are not worthy of living under the same sky. We must recover our inherent mountains and rivers, and preserve the personality of our nation. You preside over the central government, lead the people, and make great plans. There is no need to wait for my humble words. Please resolutely and decisively order a total national mobilization and declare war on Japan immediately. We would rather be shattered jade than complete tiles. If we delay any longer, it will not only disappoint the people, but I fear that the territory will shrink day by day, which is not the original intention of saving the country. Hongkui is a soldier and is nurtured by the country and supplied by the people. Serving on the battlefield is now. I respectfully lead my troops, sleeping on our spears, awaiting orders, and willing to be the vanguard, going through fire and water, and not hesitating. I send a special telegram to congratulate you and offer my humble advice." The telegram is respectfully reported, and I bow to you. Important news.</p>
<h3>Chinese Businesses Report Closures After the Shenyang Incident</h3>
<p>▲ More Than 400 Businesses Closed</p>
<p>▲ Losses Around 1.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In recent years, although this city has been affected by the sharp rise in global gold prices, the municipal authorities have made every effort to promote construction and gradually develop plans, so business can still be maintained. Unexpectedly, after the occupying Shenyang by the violent army on September 18, it has been directly and indirectly affected, resulting in rising prices and hesitant customers, resulting in unbearable losses. The number of businesses that have declared closure is unprecedented since the city's founding. Yesterday, in order to find out the exact number, the reporter personally went to various businesses inside and outside the city to investigate.

<h3>French Troops Increase on the Sino-Vietnamese Border Situation</h3>
<p>▲ French Troops Focus on Yunnan Province</p>
<p>▲ Total Troop Increase Nearly 20,000</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The fact that the French government in Vietnam has increased its troops on the Yunnan-Guangxi border has become an undeniable fact. The following is an investigation into the deployment of French troops on the Sino-Vietnamese border and the recent troop increase situation, for the reference of Chinese people studying the Sino-Vietnamese border defense issue. It is found that Southern Vietnam is connected to Siam, and Northern Vietnam is connected to the Yunnan-Guangxi border of our country. The Vietnamese French government divides the border defense of this district into five routes. Each route is stationed with an infantry regiment. Lang Son Province is one route, with two battalions of Vietnamese troops stationed, numbering about 1,000 people, and about 300 French troops. Na Ling is stationed with about 300 Vietnamese troops and about 100 French troops. Qi Xi is stationed with about 500 Vietnamese troops and about 200 French troops. Cao Ping Province is one route, with Cao Ping stationed with about 1,000 Vietnamese troops and about 500 French troops. Dong Xi is stationed with about 500 Vietnamese troops and about 200 French troops. Na Long Tun (connected to Longzhou, Shuikou, etc. in Guangxi) is stationed with about 300 Vietnamese troops, Na Ling (Longbang in Guangxi) is stationed with about 300 Vietnamese troops, and Shuo Jiang (Pingmengyi in Guangxi) is stationed with about 500 Vietnamese troops. The above is connected to our Guangxi Province. He Yang Province is one route, with He Yang stationed with about 2,000 Vietnamese troops and about 500 French troops.

The above is connected to our Yunnan Province. Hai Ning Province is one route, with Mang Jie (connected to Dongxing) stationed with about 500 Vietnamese troops and about 170 French troops, Xin Fan is stationed with about 150 Vietnamese troops and about 80 French troops, Bei Feng Tian is stationed with about 150 Vietnamese troops and about 70 French troops, and Ping Liao is stationed with about 300 Vietnamese troops and about 70 French troops. The above is connected to our Guangdong Province, Dongxing Fangcheng. Na Shu is stationed with about 300 Vietnamese troops and about 80 French troops. Ding Li is stationed with about 350 Vietnamese troops and about 100 French troops. He Qiang is stationed with about 300 Vietnamese troops and about 80 French troops.

A regiment is attached to one machine gun company, one cavalry company, one artillery company, one engineer company, and one transportation company. Vietnam is a conscription system, but it also has recruitment. Among the French troops (Vietnamese natives generally called "Western troops"), there are also African black troops, numbering about 5,000. Li Yang troops (Vietnamese native language means "rogue," actually composed of rogues from various countries recruited by the Vietnamese government) number about 6,000. The real number of French troops is about 3,000. However, the number of Vietnamese troops conscripted nationwide, combined with the reserve service of 15 years, 20 years, etc., is about 1.5 million. The number of Miao and Yao ethnic minority troops recruited is also about 20,000. The troops increased this time include about 5,000 African black troops, about 10,000 newly recruited Vietnamese Miao and Yao ethnic minority troops, and about 2,000 Li Yang troops. The troop increase is most focused on Yunnan Province, followed by Guangxi Province. There is no increase on the Guangdong Province border. Only three new French warships have been added to Guangzhou Bay. The construction of airfields and the transportation of military supplies are extremely busy in Vietnam, and the situation is quite serious.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Increases Salt Tax to Fund Military Expenses</h3>
<p>▲ Generals Propose Adding Three Yuan Per Package</p>
<p>▲ 2 Million Yuan Can Be Obtained Within Five Months</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province is originally a Huai salt import area. The price of salt was only seven or eight yuan per package ten years ago. Subsequently, military affairs were frequent. Zhao Hengti, Tang Shengzhi, and others repeatedly added special military donations to the salt tax, increasing it by one to four yuan each time. At the beginning of each donation increase, the number of tickets was limited, and it was stated that it would stop when the limit was reached. However, as a result, not only was it not canceled after the quota was filled, but it was repeatedly increased. In recent years, He Jian continued to collect taxes, and by the end of December 20, each package had been increased to 16 yuan and 6 jiao, of which the military expense surcharge accounted for more than eight or nine yuan. Therefore, the Hunan people bear the heaviest salt tax and pay the highest salt price for the Huai salt sold on the four banks of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. The Fourth Route Army expenses of He Jian's troops are entirely dependent on this for maintenance. However, the troops stationed in Hunan include six divisions of He's troops, namely Wang Dongyuan, Peng Weiren, Li Jue, Tao Guang, Chen Guangzhong, and Chen Quzhen, plus one division of Sichuan troops, Zhang Ying, and part of Qian troops, Wang Chenglie. The monthly military expenses are about 1.5 million yuan. After He Jian returned to Hunan from Beijing a few days ago, he held a military conference to discuss ways to tighten military expenses. The minimum monthly requirement is 1 million yuan, and the income is only from salt tax, tobacco and alcohol, stamp duty, and cigarettes. In peak months, it can collect 1.12 million yuan, and in off-peak months, it only collects 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Among them, the expenses of national tax agencies, the expenses of the Army Hospital and Surveying Bureau in Hunan, the funds allocated by the Salt Affairs Audit Office to repay foreign debts, and the 93,000 yuan allocated by the central government to Hunan Province for educational expenses each month, etc., total about 300,000 yuan, and are also included in this number. That is, the actual amount allocated to military expenses from the 1.12 million yuan collected in peak months is only 800,000 to 900,000 yuan, and only 400,000 to 500,000 yuan in off-peak months. Therefore, military expenses are extremely difficult, with arrears of up to ten months. The generals of each army then jointly discussed maintenance methods, and decided that increasing the salt tax was the most reliable. Therefore, five division commanders, including Wang Dongyuan, jointly requested He Jian to add three yuan per package to the Huai salt item, including the Ping Liu Xiu road fee, limited to 150 tickets. Each ticket is 4,000 packages, which can collect 12,000 yuan. 150 tickets can collect a total of 1.8 million yuan. In addition, refined salt, Sichuan salt, and Guangdong salt are also collected by comparison, which can collect more than 2 million yuan. Hunan can sell 30 tickets of salt per month, and 150 tickets can be sold out in five months. That is, the monthly salt tax revenue can be increased by 400,000 yuan. He Jian approved it and implemented it from January 1, 21st year. The collection method is appended as follows: (1) From January of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the number of military expenses and highways to be added is stipulated according to the various types of salt sold in the following areas, and the collection will be implemented. (A) The refined salt sold in Changyue Changtan and Si'an is subject to a military expense of 2.5 yuan per stone. (B) The Huaiyue salt sold in Baoqing and Hengyang is subject to a military expense of 1.5 yuan per stone and a highway donation of 3 jiao. (C) The Huaiyue salt sold in Jinshi, Yuanling, You County, and Qiyang is subject to a military expense of 1 yuan per stone and a highway donation of 2 jiao. (D) Hongjiang, Qianyang, Lingling, and Dong'an, regardless of Sichuan, Yue, or Huai salt, are subject to a military expense of 1 yuan per stone and are exempt from highway donations. (E) The Huai salt sold by other Huai salt bureaus is subject to a military expense of 2.5 yuan per stone and a highway donation of 5 jiao. (F) All Sichuan and Yue salt, regardless of water or drought, are subject to a military expense of 1 yuan per stone and are exempt from highway donations. (Note) The remaining jin of Huai salt are also collected in accordance with the regulations. (2) This military expense and highway donation shall be collected by the directors of each branch bureau and special bureau, who shall supervise the accounting and be responsible for the collection. They shall report and remit them to the general bureau in each district on a ten-day basis, and then remit them to the Fourth Route General Command and the provincial government for verification. The required remission fees shall be drawn from the remission money in accordance with the stipulated number of remission fees. However, the remission money and remission fees shall be clearly distinguished and shall not be confused in any way. In addition, if military pay is appropriated with printed receipts, no remission fees shall be paid. (3) Each bank bureau shall implement the collection from the date of receipt of the instruction and shall, on the date of receipt of the order, open a list of merchants and the number of dan of unsold salt in the warehouse and report it to the government for record. (4) All unsold salt in the warehouse, if it has been sold and a ticket has been issued, shall still be added in accordance with the regulations. (5) This military expense and highway donation shall be announced by each branch bureau and special bureau to the merchants and people to comply with and pay. Once the full amount has been collected, an order shall be issued to stop. (6) Each Sichuan and Yue salt tax bureau shall actively prevent the invasion of Huai salt import areas during the price increase period by using Yue salt jin and cheap Huai salt from neighboring provinces.</p>
<h3>Details of the Suppression of Bandits in Huangpi</h3>
<p>▲ Xu Tingyao Leads Two Brigades to Attack the Front of the Bandits</p>
<p>▲ The Bandits Retreat to Xinglongzui and Will Flee to the North Bank</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The situation of the bandits attacking Huangpi County and requesting help has been reported in the previous letter. Today's news is indeed slightly eased. Initially, the bandits captured Huang'an and joined forces with the bandits in the northern township of Huangpi, intending to take advantage of the dissatisfaction of the government army to attack Huangpi County and advance south in a big way to disturb Wuhan. Unexpectedly, the two regiments of the Fourth Division's Xu Tingyao troops had arrived at the front line and tried their best to resist. Although there were many bandits, they were still mobs. Therefore, after contacting Xu's troops on the fourth and fifth days, they suffered many casualties, but they still tried their best to move forward and refused to retreat. At that time, the Xia Dingxin Brigade of the 13th Division's Xia Douyin troops stationed in Qijiawan was ordered to reinforce. Xia Brigade was the elite of the 13th Division, and the Queshan and Qufu battles were based on this brigade as the backbone (when Xia was a regiment commander under Lu Bentang). Since then, the addition of new troops to the battle made the bandit army even more unsustainable. When all the 11th and 12th Brigades of the Fourth Division arrived, Division Commander Xu Tingyao personally led the 11th Brigade Special Task Regiment and the Communication Battalion to the front to supervise the suppression. For a time, the morale was greatly boosted, and the people's hearts were greatly reassured. The bandit troops, with a large army gathered, found it difficult to attack the county seat, so they abandoned their original plan and wanted to advance south through the county seat. The purpose of the bandits was to achieve something else, not just to capture a city or occupy a place. However, the bandit's conspiracy was seen through by the government army early. After the armies were concentrated, they were deployed separately. The two brigades of Xu Tingyao's division were responsible for the frontal attack. The ninth team of armored vehicles was under Xu's command. The two regiments of Xia Douyin's division were responsible for the side attack. Xiao's division protected the railway, and Li's division guarded the county seat. After the deployment was completed, a large-scale suppression was launched. On the sixth and seventh days, Zhang Brigade of Xu's division and Xia Brigade of Xia's division had fierce battles with the bandit troops. At the same time, aircraft assisted, killing many bandits. Because the bandits suffered heavy losses, they retreated to the north on the morning of the eighth. The vanguard retreated to Xinglongzui, and the headquarters retreated to Yanzi Gang. The bandit army was exhausted and no longer dared to attack desperately. Division Commander Xu Tingyao, seeing that the bandits had been repelled, ordered his troops to follow up and suppress them, and sent Chief of Staff Sheng Shiheng to preside over the front. It is not yet certain whether he will return to Wuchang on the eighth to supervise the pursuit again. During the fierce battle between the soldiers and bandits, the Han Changjun Brigade of the 48th Division's Xu Yuanquan troops was also ordered to move from the Hebei district and the new district to ambush the bandits. The Luojiatian and other places have been recovered. On the eighth, Xu telegraphed to the Appeasement Office for a report. The original text is as follows: Hankou Appeasement Chief He Junjian, I learned that Brigadier Han Changjun of the Weiwu and Weishen telegrams, section said that six or seven hundred bandits fled near the mouth of the Yellow River and the new district. This morning, I ordered Regiment Commander Wang to lead the Yue Battalion, the Zong Regiment Zhang Battalion, and the Zhao Regiment Cao Battalion to advance to that area. I then received a report from Regiment Commander Wang, saying that the Yue Battalion advanced to two li from the mouth of the Yellow River and the new district at 9:00 am, encountering more than 200 bandits, half of whom had guns. After a fierce attack by our officers and soldiers, the bandits resisted slightly and fled to the Luojiatian area. At ten o'clock, the area was occupied. At the same time, Zhang Battalion advanced to near the Lilin shop, and a few bandits fled north at the sound of the wind. Cao Battalion advanced to near Zhangchangling, encountering more than 300 bandits, who were attacked by our Yue Battalion and fled to the Changyan area. After the troops searched and suppressed, they returned to their original defenses at 3:00 pm. There is no major change near Baliwan. Peng Brigade reported that the bandits of Dasheng Mountain were defeated. The 30th Division reported that the bandits were defeated in successive days. In addition to ordering the brigade to be vigilant and suppress them as appropriate, I hereby report. Xu Yuanquan bows, (January 8)</p>
<h3>Lu Nan's Liu and Guo Divisions to Implement Reorganization</h3>
<p>▲ Going to Gaotang from Dawenkou for Verification</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Guitang led his troops to surrender, and all arrangements have been thoroughly discussed and agreed upon. However, the date has been extended repeatedly, and the assembly is not yet complete. The reason is that Liu's troops are mostly within the Mengshan Mountains. He voluntarily agreed to transfer them completely for reorganization. Therefore, regarding the assembly time, the initial period was half a month, hoping that with a large number of people, a division could be formed. Han Fuju approved a period of ten days. Unexpectedly, after the deadline, he requested another extension because the number of people was still large and assembly required time. Zhan Shutang, commander of the 81st Division, came to Jinan from nearby to report to Han about this matter. According to Zhan, Liu Guitang and his troops are now in the area bordering Yishui and Mengyin, trying their best to avoid the army. There is still no news as to when the assembly will be completed. At that time, Han Fuju believed that Liu's troops had repeatedly violated the time limit for assembly, and it was urgent to inspect the truth. Therefore, he specially dispatched Liu Shuxiang, chief of the Staff Department, to Yanzhou for inspection and to discuss the issue of incorporating Liu's troops with Gu Liangmin, commander of the 21st Division stationed in Yanzhou. After Liu arrived in Yanzhou, Liu Guitang and Guo Mafeng repeatedly sent representatives to meet with Liu and Gu.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>They still claimed that the number of troops was too large and could not be assembled in a short period of time, and that many family members were being carried, which must be properly arranged. They requested that the assembly deadline be extended to before the 10th of this month, which was also approved by Han. As of yesterday (the 5th), the Provincial Government received another telegram from Liu Shuxiang and Gu Liangmin in Yanzhou reporting that Liu Guitang stated that in addition to urging the troops to assemble quickly, Liu himself would first lead his troops to Yishui for assembly, and Guo Mafeng's troops would also set off immediately. It was determined that they would be able to arrive for assembly before the 10th. Today (the 6th) in the afternoon, Han Fuju ordered the Railway Bureau to prepare a train of empty cars to depart for Dawenkou tomorrow. After Liu Guitang's troops assemble, they will board the train and be transported to the designated area in northern Shandong to await the dispatch of personnel for verification and reorganization. At the same time, the armored train "Beiping" was divided into two trains to patrol the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways. (6th)</p>
<p>Another report: The surrender and acceptance of Liu Guitang, Guo Mafeng, and other troops in southern Shandong. As a result of the contact between Liu Shuxiang, Gu Liangmin, and Liu Guitang's representative Xia Ziming, as of the 5th, Gu and Liu telegraphed that more than 4,000 troops of Liu and Guo had completed assembly and were scheduled to depart from Dabianqiao on foot to Dawenkou on the 7th to board the train. Han immediately ordered the Railway Bureau to prepare a train to go to Dawenkou to transport Liu's troops to Gaotang in northern Shandong to await verification and reorganization. At the same time, he ordered Dai Hongbin, commander of the armored train, to divide the "Beiping" armored train into two trains to patrol and suppress the area between Dawenkou and Yucheng. (Liu's troops disembark at Yucheng and go to Gaotang) and telegraphed Gu Liangmin to be on strict alert at Dawenkou. As soon as Liu's troops arrive, they should board the train immediately, and only after arriving in Gaotang can they be verified and reorganized. However, those without guns are not allowed to board the train. Liu himself will also borrow Xia Ziming to come to Jinan and, together with Zhang Futian, who was sent by Shandong compatriots in Peiping to Jinan to handle this matter, pay respects to Han Fuju to discuss the reorganization procedures. The issue of incorporating Liu and Guo's troops can thus be concluded. Attached is the exchange of telegrams between Liu, Gu, and Han, as follows: 1. To Commander-in-Chief Han Jun in Jinan: Zi Mi reports, Zhi Chen's telegram received and understood. Liu and Guo have been ordered to quickly depart for Dawenkou. 2. According to Deputy Officer Liu Donghan's telephone report from Bianqiao, Liu and Guo plan to lead their troops from Bianqiao to Dawenkou on Yu Day to await verification and reorganization. The number of people is approximately 4,000, and they need 10,000 steamed buns for supplies every day, etc. 3. Please order the Tai'an County Government to quickly prepare supplies and find suitable locations for stationing near Dawenkou for future use. 4. Xie, Commander, has returned to Xintai at Wei Wu. 5. In addition to dispatching Deputy Officer Liu Jizhong to Tai'an to coordinate with the County Government in handling all matters, and ordering the engineering battalion stationed in Tai'an and the forest regiment stationed in Sishui to be on strict guard, respectfully reported. Officer Liu Shuxiang Gu Liangmin kowtow Wei Wu Yin. 2. To Master Gu of Yanzhou, Jing Xuan, First Director Liu, Wei Zhen brother: All five reports in Wei Wu's telegram have been received and understood. After Liu and Guo's troops arrive at Dawenkou, they should be ordered to board the train and go to Gaotang without verification to await verification and reorganization. However, those without firearms must not be allowed to board the train. This matter must be explained to Liu and Guo first. The required vehicles will be dispatched by the deputy officer on Yu Day and escorted to Dawenkou for use, and an armored train will be sent to provide security. However, at least a battalion-level unit must be dispatched in advance at Dawenkou Station to monitor closely to prevent unforeseen circumstances. As for the supplies required by the unit, Tai'an County has been ordered to prepare them. You must follow the instructions and report back at any time. Respectfully, Han Fuju Yu Can Yin. (7th)</p>

While passing through the Heiyu area of Huangqing Township outside the North Gate, four bandits suddenly blocked the road, took out sharp blades, and forbade any noise. They stripped off all of Li's fur coat and cotton pants. After repeated pleading, Li managed to get back a lined jacket to cover his body. The rickshaw driver tried to escape to report to the police but was caught and severely beaten by the bandits. The bandits then took the stolen goods and fled into a small road.</p>

This caused disputes and aroused public anger. Mo Jiping and Ge Jingyi, local gentry, were particularly excited and initiated the organization of a user support group to deal with Minghua. The company notified all sectors the day before yesterday, stating that Ge and Mo had previously stolen electricity, and the company had obtained evidence and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for filing. It was obviously a matter of framing with malice, and it was determined to file a complaint for investigation. Therefore, the two sides are now in litigation.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Harassing the Countryside: In the Tanjiatu area near Shuanglinzhen in Huzhou, more than 50 refugees suddenly arrived from Nantao the day before yesterday. They spoke with a Henan accent and went to the homes of villagers to forcibly borrow money for cooking and seize firewood. They also took the opportunity to steal chickens and ducks. The villagers came forward to dissuade them, but it was not only ineffective but also resulted in barbaric actions. The villagers saw that they were unreasonable and reported to the various land and water military and police agencies in the town. Troops were then dispatched to the village to suppress them and expel them from the border.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Collection of Wine Tax: Farmers Petition. Farmers in the Huadafang Village area of the 13th District (i.e., Xin'an Township) in the county usually brew wine from mud wine and rotten wheat to serve as feed for pigs. The Wine License Tax Bureau has never collected taxes. Recently, Bao Luyi, the director of the Wine License Tax Collection Office, established a branch in Huada Village and collected wine tax from farmers, but it was inconsistent with the tax regulations. The day before yesterday, more than 700 farmers in the area, holding flags, set off on a parade to the 13th District Office to petition. The district chief, Zhu Zhengxin, received them. The representatives put forward four demands: 1. Reduce the public sales fee.</p>
<p>2. Stop illegal levies. 3. Immediately abolish the branch. 4. Severely punish Bao Luyi. District Chief Zhu agreed to submit a petition to the higher authorities for handling. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>The Dangkou Opium Case Is Scheduled for Investigation: A certain ship in Dangkou Town, 11th District (Nanyan City), recently transported 484 taels of opium from Baihu by Wang Weiqing, a villager in the town.

The sailors Zhang Bao, Bing Jinbiao, Wang Weiqing, and Wang's father, Jinbao, were arrested and transferred to the 7th Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After the director, Hui Haoqian, conducted a preliminary trial, Zhang, Bing, and Wang's father were released on bail, and only Wang Weiqing was presented to the General Bureau along with more than 30 taels of opium and transferred to the court for interrogation.

The court has now scheduled the 13th of this month to hold a retrial and has issued warrants to send bailiffs Yuan Meixun to the countryside to subpoena all related parties to the case for investigation to find out the truth.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Pawnbroker Robbed on the Way with Funds: Since its opening, the Xielong Pawnshop in Xiasu Town, Wuyi County, has been in business for nine years, with annual business of no less than 100,000 yuan. In addition to the pawned items, all gold and silver ornaments are completely sent to the city to prevent danger. The person responsible for the transportation has been Liu Xinfeng of the pawnshop for nine years, without any mistakes. Unexpectedly, on December 30th of last year, the pawnshop went to the city as usual, carrying not only various jewelry receipts extracted in the past, but also 500 yuan of the pawnshop's deposit with Zhihe Shen Bank and 600 yuan of cash entrusted by Feng Muhang to be brought back to the village. It is unknown how they disappeared on the way. The pawnshop searched everywhere for many days without success and immediately reported it to the Third District Office, which reported it to the county government for investigation. According to news today (the 9th), the pawnshop has received a letter from the kidnappers in Suzhou, demanding a ransom of 2,000 yuan, signed by the bandit leader Zhang Longbiao.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Reassignment of a Large Number of Patrol Officers: The Provincial Public Security Bureau yesterday ordered the reassignment of Cui Yongkun, internal patrol officer of the Fifth Branch, to the Sixth Branch, and Sun Changgui, internal patrol officer of the Sixth Branch, to the Fifth Branch.

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Dispute over Tonghai School Land: The Education Bureaus of Nantong and Haimen Counties have filed a lawsuit due to a dispute over the Lyusi school land. The Higher Court has ordered the county government that regarding the school land dispute, it should request instructions from the superior agency in charge and not rush into litigation. The case is being handled by the Education Department. The Real Situation of Qianye's Bankruptcy: Four Qianye companies in Nantong have gone bankrupt in succession, causing extreme panic in the market. The Shanghai banking community has inquired with the Qianye Association about the actual situation. The association immediately replied, stating that this year, disasters have been widespread and foreign insults have been relied upon, affecting the overall financial situation, which is extremely frightening. Recently, the bankruptcy of Yongchang Lindeji in our territory and the financial difficulties of Zhen Yue, etc., are indeed related to the current situation, but their fatal injury is the failure of speculation or being implicated by speculative families. With the organization of Nantong's financial community, most of the strengths are not weak. Those who do not enter the path of speculation, even if affected by the situation, will not have such a large Liu scar, at most, the account books are stagnant. Zhang Fa's Property Has Been Fully Returned: The Nantong County Government has been ordered by the province to return all of Zhang Fa's confiscated property. However, the rent collected in the past has been transferred to the province and will no longer be returned according to Article 8. Zhang Fa has arrived in Shanghai from Dalian and is entrusting people to sell farmland and stocks in Tong to contribute funds to the winter relief work of the Jiangbei Guo Bu River.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Advice from the Principal of Jiangsu Province to Students to Resume Classes (1)</h3>
<p>The principals of Jiangsu Provincial Secondary Schools advise all secondary school students in the province to resume classes:</p>
<p>Our nation and people have suffered from the aggression and oppression of Western imperialists for a long time. In peacetime, economic aggression and cultural aggression are sufficient to control our fate. In times of trouble, political oppression and military oppression are used to the extreme. Anyone with blood and vigor can hardly bear this. Since our late Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated revolution, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, established the republic, and advocated fighting against imperialism and abolishing unequal treaties, people with imperialist tendencies have been thunderstruck and joined forces to go. The revolutionary forces have been vigorously promoted, and Western imperialists have become slightly more cautious. Unfortunately, in recent years, the sages of the party and the state have failed to uphold the late Premier's forty years of sacrifice and struggle, and to endure for the sake of the country, resulting in chaos. The facts are obvious and cannot be denied. Coupled with the natural disasters this year, the floods have caused suffering to the people. Thereupon, Japan, which has been coveting and plotting, has recognized this as a rare opportunity and has brazenly disregarded it and directly wielded the knife. Now, three provinces have fallen in just over three months, and the flames of war in the Northeast have spread throughout the country. People are at the mercy of the butcher's knife, and we are the fish and meat. China is in danger of being submerged, and the motherland is suffering from the pain of destruction. The first mistake was the authorities' policy of non-resistance, and the second mistake was the League of Nations' aiding the evildoers. The strong enemy took advantage of this, and the clowns became more rampant. Coupled with international conspiracies, which are treacherous and unpredictable, Yunnan and Guangxi are in alarm and are being forced to come together. Under this unprecedentedly serious situation, all the elderly know that they will soon die, and even if the country is destroyed and they become slaves and servants, they will not last long. However, they still gnash their teeth and speak out with righteous indignation, encouraging the remaining men, without looking back. Moreover, young students with rich emotions and surging blood, hearing the drums of the Northeast and seeing the rivers and mountains being swept away, are indignant, heartbroken, running around crying, and are forced to pick up their pens and rise up, strike, petition, propagandize, and raise donations. This is what they should do. The gentlemen of the universities took the lead, and the middle school students followed. They took the patriotism as the root and made empty calls. How can the youth fail the country? Although the vitality of the country lies in the youth, the youth's salvation of the country depends on their studies. Therefore, sacrificing the youth's studies is tantamount to destroying the vitality of the country. If the vitality remains, even if the country is destroyed, it can be expected to recover. If the vitality disappears, even if it survives, it will be difficult to avoid extinction. Therefore, striking and marching is to endure the pain for a while to urge the government and awaken the people, which is justice, conscience, and responsibility, and no one can criticize it. If the strike becomes long-term or indefinite, the marching, speeches, fundraising, and petitions will eventually be exhausted. Once the momentum is exhausted, it will decline again and again. As a result, laziness takes over, the country cannot be saved, and they are unwilling to study. The result is perfunctory, decadent, empty, and suicidal. No one dares to read it. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek resigned, the government was reorganized, and the previous rumors of neutrality in Jinzhou, joint management of Tianjin, and direct negotiations between China and Japan are no longer a problem. The youth's responsibility has been fulfilled, and the government's renewal can be expected. We send it out, and we can take it back. Therefore, for the sake of all the young gentlemen of secondary schools in our province, we should take this opportunity to regain our spirits, resume classes on a regular basis, and encourage and spur ourselves with the greatest determination and effort to progress in cultivating morality and undertaking studies, and to lie down on firewood and taste gall. The way to restore and cultivate the vitality of the country lies in this, and the way to fundamentally save the nation from danger also lies in this. Patriots must be able to love themselves, and those who save the country must first save themselves. Striving to cultivate personality is to love oneself, and striving to pursue knowledge and exercise the body is to save oneself. Apart from this, there is no other way. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Baseball Field Short Practice</h3>
<p>The Malay players, having traveled by sea for a long time, and having to play tomorrow, went to the baseball field for practice immediately after unloading their luggage for a short practice. The sound of the ball was like the sound of soldiers, and their leg strength was rarely seen. The wingers' passes were extremely accurate, especially the right winger. Spectators were impressed, saying they should not be underestimated.</p>

<h3>Jinan Actually Ranked Second</h3>
<p>In the Westerners' First Division League, three giants stand tall, namely Lincoln, Western Police, and Jinan. Yesterday's battle between Lincoln and the Western Police at the racecourse was a battle for the top spot. Since Lincoln acquired Nuosen, they have maintained their superior position, striving to move up and hoping to gain the final glory. The Western Police were the champions last year. At the beginning of the season, they were slightly disadvantaged, but later recovered their old form and seemed poised to retain the title. What they fear are Lincoln and Jinan. Yesterday's fierce 90-minute battle ended in a 2-2 draw, with Lincoln firmly in first place, the Western Police still in third, and Jinan, although with the same score as the Western Police, actually ranked second, above the Western Police. Also yesterday, in the First Division match between Scott and the Shanghai team, Scott won 4-3. The recent First Division results are as follows:</p>

<h3>Vow to Destroy Pirates: John Greatly Defeats Hujiang</h3>
<p>32 to 23 points</p>
<p>A Fierce Battle at Xiqing Basketball Court</p>
<p>▲First Final in Group B</p>
<p>▲Huzhong Defeats Morning Star</p>
<p>The basketball elites of John's University and Hujiang University met at the Xiqing Basketball Room at 8:00 PM last night, with a fierce competition, neither side yielding. John's copper-walled defense made it difficult for Hujiang's generals, who usually hit every shot, to take even a step last night, and they succumbed to John's lead. The result was 22 to 23, a difference of nine points. John's hope for the Xiqing championship is more assured now. In the first final of Group B, the Hujiang Affiliated Middle School defeated the Morning Star team 31-24. There are still three more groups of second and third finals to be played. (1) Youtai defeated Meigong, B 1, 25-16. (2) Xiaguang defeated Qingguang, Group A 36-30. (3) Jinan defeated Dare to Die, Group A, 36-32.</p>
<h3>John's Five Tigers Conquer Hujiang</h3>
<p>▲Cheers Resounded, Each with Their Own Melody, Wonderfully Inexpressible Cheerleading Team Began Work The cheerleaders of both schools occupied the upper and lower floors of the deafening basketball room, and when John finally won, the joy was indescribable.</p>
<p>▲The Championship Is About John This match is greatly related to the championship. Although it was once severely poisoned by McLing, it is certainly able to overcome Hujiang, and can still compete with the pirates. The future is infinitely hopeful. However, it is difficult for Hujiang to defeat the pirates, and it will never be willing to be a female. Therefore, this battle is fierce. John Should Have Won Early John won by nine points. In terms of opportunity, it should not have reached this number. It could have been won much earlier. There were countless balls that were missed under the basket. The angle was only a little off, and it only needed to brush the board to go into the net, but it was missed. It's a pity that only two out of eleven free throws were made, which shows the problem. In the future, work should be done on this in the final against the pirates.</p>
<h3>Copper Wall Iron Bastion</h3>
<p>John's Victory: First, Steady and Calm Chen Xianglong and Cheng Jingshi are all able to strictly guard five people, forming a unified force that leaves Hujiang with no chance to shoot. Lin Zequn and Wu Youliang are like two tigers who never miss a shot. Hujiang ran into walls everywhere, while the forward Cheng Jingshi performed greatly, and therefore, victory was achieved.</p>
<h3>Hujiang's Defeat</h3>
<p>Hujiang's defeat was due to John's strict defense, and it cannot be denied that their performance was diminished. The workmen were flustered, playing the pipa wildly, committing fouls repeatedly, moving carefully with the ball, but unable to score. Feng Nianhua only scored three points, how could they not be defeated?</p>
<h3>Smooth Sailing</h3>
<p>John led all the way from the beginning to the end. Cheng Jingshi scored first, and Hujiang fought bravely, with the score only one or two points apart. At 6-5, 8-7, Yun Ruchun scored a long shot, making it 9-8, the only time Hujiang surpassed them. Hou Xuemin then scored three consecutive shots, giving John an 11-5 lead in the first half.</p>
<h3>Retreating as a Strategy</h3>
<p>After the break, Hujiang replaced Lin with Dai, adding three points suddenly. Feng Nianhua also scored, making it 16-14, and then 18-17, only one point behind. Hou Xuemin also added four points, and Hujiang fell behind again. John knew Hujiang's speed and used a delaying tactic against them, retreating as a strategy, not seeking to rush. Passing the ball right and left, Hujiang could do nothing. In the last minute, Lin Zequn scored a foul, making it 32-20 at the end of the game.</p>
<h3>Vow to Destroy Pirates</h3>
<p>The only strong enemy left for John is the pirates. Last night's victory over Hujiang greatly boosted morale, and they all resolved to vow to destroy the pirates.</p>
<p>John's University Fouls Points Hujiang University Fouls Points Hou Xuemin Right 3 times 10 points Feng Nianhua Right 3 times 3 points Cheng Jingshi Left 1 time 10 points Wu Guolin Left 2 times 9 points Chen Xianglong Middle 1 time 1 point Li Ruchun Middle 0 times 8 points Lin Zequn Guard 4 times 2 points Lin Haoying Guard 3 times 2 points Xu Weixin Guard 0 times 0 points Dai Zuen Guard 0 times 0 points Wu Youliang Guard 2 times 3 points Wang Xiliang Guard 3 times 1 point Total 11 32 Total 11 23 In the first half, John scored 16 points, Hujiang scored 11 points. In the second half, John scored 16 points, Hujiang scored 12 points.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Goes to Ningbo to Visit Chiang Today</h3>
<p>Chiang, Hu, and Wang Must Actually Cooperate</p>
<p>Otherwise, Sun Also Indicates Resignation</p>
<p>Liu Luyin Went to Hong Kong Yesterday to See Hu</p>
<p>Amidst the national crisis, the call for Chiang, Hu, and Wang to jointly come to Beijing to preside over the central government has been resounding, but it has not yet materialized. A week after the new government was established, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, expressed that he could not support it alone, so he came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and is scheduled to go to Fenghua today with Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng to visit Chiang and urge him to come. After Sun arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he intended to visit Wang Jingwei immediately, but Wang declined due to illness, only sending two representatives to visit Sun, informing him of the difficulty of not being able to meet due to illness. As for Hu Hanmin, who is recuperating in Hong Kong, Sun has also sent several telegrams urging him to come, but has received no reply. Feng Yuxiang also expressed yesterday that he would soon go to Hong Kong to visit Hu and to Ningbo to visit Chiang. Sun further told reporters that if he still cannot get one or two of the three gentlemen, Chiang, Hu, and Wang, to come to Beijing, then he will have to resign to apologize to the people of the country. The domestic and foreign troubles are so serious that the severity of the situation can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Important Speech by Sun Ke</h3>
<p>Premier Sun gave a speech to reporters when he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, saying: "I came to Shanghai this time entrusted by my colleagues in the Central Committee to comfort Mr. Wang Jingwei and persuade him to dispel his intention to resign, recuperate peacefully, and come to Beijing as soon as possible. Moreover, the diplomatic issue now seems to have a new situation, but it can also be said to be a new difficulty. We must discuss it at length with Mr. Wang and others to obtain a proper response strategy. The current national environment is extremely difficult. I have repeatedly declared that the three gentlemen, Chiang, Hu, and Wang, must jointly come to Beijing to preside over the central government before there is a solution. I also plan to go to Fenghua within a few days to urge Mr. Chiang to return to Beijing immediately. As for whether it is possible for the three gentlemen, Chiang, Hu, and Wang, to jointly come to Beijing, I naturally cannot give a definite answer. However, the national crisis is so critical at the moment that the three gentlemen must come out together to bear the burden, which has become the unanimous demand of the entire party and the entire country. The purpose of my coming to Beijing this time is to promote the movement of sincere unity with the spirit of jointly facing the national crisis. I believe that this is a necessary path to save the country, so I will follow it regardless of all difficulties. The three gentlemen all have a long history in the party and the country, and in any case, they must not continue to ignore the crisis of the country and disregard it. I feel that my qualifications, reputation, and abilities are all shallow, and I am not capable of bearing the major responsibility of the Executive Yuan. However, I am not behind others in my love for the party and the country, and I especially cannot bear to see the Chinese Kuomintang and the Republic of China, which my late father worked so hard to create, gradually falling into a broken, fragmented, and irreparable danger. Since I have been entrusted by my comrades, I have no choice but to temporarily try my best to support the transitional situation, hoping to use my ability to promote the practical cooperation of the three gentlemen, Chiang, Wang, and Hu, and then I can be relieved of my responsibility. However, since I took office nine days ago, none of the three gentlemen has resolutely come to Beijing. This not only makes me personally distraught, but also makes the people of the whole country feel disappointed. The emptiness of the central government is the greatest danger to the country today. Those who have the power do not come to take responsibility, and I, who have no power, am forced to bear the greatest responsibility, which will inevitably lead to exhaustion and will not help the country. Seeing this danger, I cannot but make a most sincere request to the three gentlemen for the sake of the party and the country. If it is still not granted, then I have exhausted my wisdom and can only resign to avoid further delaying the time and harming the party and the country."</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Visits Sun</h3>
<p>Yesterday Went to Moliai</p>
<p>Road, Sun's residence, to visit Premier Sun. Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, Xue Dubi, Li Zongren, and Li Jishen were present. Wu Tiecheng originally intended to go to Beijing that night, but decided to accompany Sun to Fenghua today because Sun was scheduled to meet Chiang today. At that time, Sun and the others discussed the current situation for a long time before they left.</p>
<h3>Liu Luyin Went to Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Vice President of the Examination Yuan</p>
<p>Liu Luyin, carried a joint letter from the Chairman of the group, Lin Sen, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, and the President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, and other important central committee members to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 8:30, he took the Changxing Company's ship "Asian Queen" from Shanghai to Hong Kong to urge Hu Hanmin to come to Beijing and unite with Wang, Chiang, and other central committee members to jointly face the national crisis. According to Liu before his departure, in addition to urging Hu to come to Beijing, he also requested the Guangdong Committee to abolish the two sub-committees of military and political affairs, and to urge Tang Shaochuan and other members of the National Government to come to Beijing to take office.</p>
<h3>Business and Industry Urge Wang, Chiang, and Hu to Come to Beijing</h3>
<p>Filling the Core and Saving the Nation Together</p>
<p>Unanimously Urging to Jointly Plan for National Salvation</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Unions Send Telegrams to Various Places Postal Workers' Union and Postal Workers' Union, representing postal workers across the country, urged Chiang, Wang, Hu, and other responsible Central Committee members to come to Beijing to jointly preside over the central government. The telegram reads: Urgent, Nanjing Central Party Department, National Government, Our national woes at home and abroad alarm the government and its people alike. The former government bore its responsibility, bearing both insult and burden, ultimately resigning due to their troubles. To this day, the whole party remains on amicable terms, rebuilding the core, looking forward to seeing their spirit revived and collaborating on auspicious plans to live up to the hopes of the four hundred million people who have been working hard for the country for months. However, as the years pass, Jinzhou has painfully been lost, and the key points inside the pass have been repeatedly warning. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent, while the heavy soldiers on the border watch without losing a single arrow. The gentlemen of the palace are mostly lurking and watching the changes. Looking back and verifying the past, how can we overcome suspicion and fear? The members of the association are filled with pain and anger, and they hereby represent the postal workers across the country to telegraph your ministry and government, and to telegraph the three members of Chiang, Wang, and Hu, and other responsible gentlemen, to have the determination to jointly face the national crisis, and to immediately and quickly gather in the capital to take charge of the country, so as to consolidate the authority of the core and achieve the practical effect of saving the country. The success or failure of a thousand autumns depends on this moment. Love yourself and love the country, and quickly plan for it. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Nanjing Postal Workers' Union, Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Zhenjiang Postal Workers' Union, Suzhou Postal Workers' Union, Wuxi Postal Workers' Union, Changzhou Postal Workers' Union, etc. Qing.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Association issued a declaration on the matter of urging members Wang, Hu, Chiang, and others to take office. The declaration reads: To all newspaper offices and compatriots across the country. Since September 18th of last year, the vast Northeast Three Provinces have been lost by Zhang Xueliang alone, and the governments of Guangdong, Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces have also intercepted the principal and interest funds of treasury bills. There have even been rumors of the Zhenjiang Nine-Province Conference, the Beiping Joint Defense Conference, and the Southwest National Defense Conference. The disasters of the Japanese flood have not yet passed, and the alarms of panic have already arrived. Looking forward to the future, we cannot help but feel cold and afraid. This phenomenon is really due to the fact that the National Government members such as Wang, Chiang, and Hu are staying in various places, not taking responsibility for coming to Beijing to jointly preside over the core. In this autumn of survival and danger, the people are running around in a sweat, seeking to solve the national crisis. The national committee members are all disciples of the prime minister and revolutionary heroes, and they should not be braver in internal strife than they are in external troubles. They are all people who deeply recognize the prime minister's legacy, and they should not treat national affairs as child's play, sitting by and watching the country fall into ruin without seeking to save it. Although the national committee members are indeed responsible for themselves, they are unwilling to mislead the country and the people again to mislead themselves, and they should express their intention to retire. Otherwise, they should simply return power to the people, so that the people can decide for themselves. Please let the national committee members open a door and do not delay and make mistakes. China is the country of all our people. Please all compatriots across the country unanimously urge to jointly plan for national salvation. This is hereby declared. I hope you will all see it. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Association, Jia.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Speaks</h3>
<p>Wang, Chiang, and Hu Will All Be Able to Take Responsibility Soon</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Huanzhang made the following remarks to reporters yesterday: (Q) Mr. Feng, what are your opinions on Mr. Wang's resignation? (A) I didn't talk much about Mr. Wang's illness yesterday, so I have no opinion to express. (Q) Mr. Feng, is it possible to go to Hong Kong to meet Mr. Hu? (A) It will be possible soon, not only to Hong Kong, but also to Fenghua. (Q) Mr. Feng, you are aiming to unite the leaders to jointly face the national crisis. You have been in Shanghai for ten days. Have you contacted the leaders? Is it possible to unite? (A) This work is very difficult, but if you do it for a day, you will have a day's worth of achievements. (Q) Mr. Wang suddenly resigned, and the Executive Yuan said that according to the current system, all policies must be approved by the Central Political Council. If Wang, Hu, and Chiang do not come, then the government center will have no responsible person. How will it be saved? (A) Wang, Hu, and Chiang will all be able to take responsibility soon.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Speaks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, reporters visited Mr. Wang Jingwei. (Q) Does your telegram resigning from the Standing Committee of the Central Party Department and the Political Conference mean that you have a negative attitude towards the political situation? (A) I am by no means negative. I am actually ill and have been absent from important positions for a long time. I feel uneasy and hope that the Central Committee will select people for the job to govern. I have a sincere desire to support the newly established government. As long as I recover slightly, I will definitely try my best to fulfill my responsibilities.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Discussed the Demands of Student Representatives Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Detailed Discussion by the Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The Strike Issue Was Considered a Major Matter</p>
<p>The Consent of All Industry Associations Must Be Solicited</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reported that due to the loss of Jinzhou and the Japanese army's approach to Shanhaiguan, which is an emergency situation, and the government has no countermeasures, the Anti-Japanese Association of Shanghai Universities and the Anti-Japanese Association of Middle School Students requested a strike from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for four consecutive days from the fourth to the seventh of this month, and convened a citizens' assembly and a demonstration. The chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, personally explained everything several times. Because the student representatives insisted on their request and their attitude was very angry, the Chamber of Commerce decided to convene an emergency meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for discussion at 4 pm yesterday after a standing committee meeting. More than 20 student representatives attended yesterday to explain the reasons and made sincere and earnest statements, and requested (1) a strike on Monday (2) a citizens' assembly to be held on the 17th, and asked for unanimous participation, etc. The executive and supervisory committee members who attended the meeting yesterday were Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Yansong, Lu Qisheng, Chen Songyuan, Wu Zhihao, Cheng Xiechun, Gu Xinyi, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Wenqi, Pei Yunqing, Xiang Songmao, Jiang Zhigang, Lu Fengzhu, Ma Jiliang, Luo Qinghua, etc. discussed in detail and resolved that the executive and supervisory committee members expressed deep sympathy and admiration for the student representatives' patriotic enthusiasm. The request to participate in the citizens' assembly on the 17th, the association will notify all members to participate enthusiastically. Regarding the strike on Monday, although the executive and supervisory committee members can express their acceptance, but the matter is major and the consent of all industry associations must be solicited. The strike date is planned to be held on the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Demobilization Loan Lottery Held Yesterday for Principal Repayment</h3>
<p>Total Principal Repaid: $1,500,000</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the Ministry of Finance held the sixth principal repayment lottery for the Demobilization Loan at the Hong Kong Road Bankers' Association. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives present: Yang Tizhi from the Auditing Department as an inspector, Xu Jiqing from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Fan Jietang from the Fund Custody Committee, Hu Mengjia from the Shanghai Banking Association (representing Jin Jingyuan), Yan Junan from the Shanghai Money Trade Association, Li Yangsheng from the Central Bank as a lottery drawer, Cheng Muhao from the Bank of China, Wei Bo from the Bank of Communications, managers Lu Shutang, He Xiaojuan, Liang Yaozong, registrars Chen Shaochao, You Dunti, Chen Jian, clerical staff Huang Qizong, Xu Zuhuang, Huang Meizhao, and receptionists He Yaoqing, Zheng Yijian, Fang Jingzhong.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Vice Minister of Finance Lin Kanghou presided and delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Huang, stating: "Today is the date for the sixth principal repayment lottery for the 18th Year Demobilization Loan. I am fortunate to be here with you all. The National Government has always been punctual in repaying principal and interest on all types of public bonds and treasury bills. In the year of 20 alone, over $114,680,000 was repaid in principal and over $57,250,000 in interest, totaling over $171,900,000. The credit of public bonds is extremely well-known. Recently, the bond market has declined slightly due to various reasons, mainly the trend of the financial market. The availability of credit is also related to the bond market. Currently, the government is striving to consolidate the original funds for all public bonds and treasury bills, and all monthly principal and interest payments will continue to be handled according to the original regulations without any changes. I believe the credit of public bonds and treasury bills will become more stable. This sixth lottery for the Demobilization Loan is the first of the 21st year. Being that it is closely watched, the Minister personally attends to show the importance we place on public bonds. In the future, we will continue to repay principal and interest on all types of public bonds and treasury bills on time. Directly maintaining public bonds is indirectly maintaining finance, and both should work together to transform the current economic situation. On the occasion of this lottery, I would like to clearly state the government's commitment to consolidating the credit of public bonds."</p>
<p>Lottery Report: Vice Minister Lin, substituting for the Minister, concluded his speech and reported: "Today is the date for the sixth principal repayment lottery for the 18th Year Demobilization Loan. We are delighted to have you all here to observe. The total value of the 18th Year Demobilization Loan issued was $50,000,000. Excluding the principal already repaid in the first to fifth lotteries, today's sixth repayment lottery will draw five lots, each for $500,000, totaling $2,500,000. All bond certificates drawn will be paid by the Central, China, and Communications Banks in all locations, starting from the 31st of this month, along with the sixth period interest, all paid in national currency, regardless of location. Please have the supervisors inspect the lottery lots and the lottery lot register for execution."</p>
<p>Winning Numbers: 06, 37, 78, 88, 98, a total of five lots. The total principal to be repaid is $2,500,000.</p>
<h3>Merchant Steamship Company Strike Still Under Mediation</h3>
<p>Hope for Resolution</p>
<p>Regarding the strike by Merchant Steamship Company sailors demanding wages, yesterday, mediators Du Yuesheng and Li Zhengwu were appointed to mediate, and one ship has already been sent out. The remaining ships are still suspended. The news from yesterday is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Continuing Suspension of River Steamers: Twelve river and sea steamers have already been suspended. Yesterday, the Changjiang steamer "Jiangjing" also joined the strike after arriving in Shanghai and entering the port. Its sailors, stokers, etc., went to the union to automatically join the wage demand group and carried out the strike. If this is not resolved today, then the two steamers arriving in Shanghai today, "Jiangxin" and "Yushun," will also join. Other ships en route have sent telegrams to the association for inquiries and assistance.</p>
<p>Mediation Process: After Du and Li were appointed as mediators, the sailors and stokers nominated Jin Yueshi, Gong Wenfang, Che Defang, etc., to go to Du's residence to discuss the matter. The representatives stated the hardships of the employees on the ships, the meager wages, and that the monthly salary of sailors and stokers was only over $30, from which $12 was deducted for food. They even had to pay for their own soap, etc. How could the treatment compare with that of the bureau staff? Du and Li expressed great sympathy for the representatives' statements and promised to mediate.</p>
<p>First the Ningbo Route: Du and Li discussed with the representatives and said that they had contacted the bureau and would be responsible for resolving the issue of double wages. However, today, the "Xin Jiangtian" ship must first be sent to Ningbo from the thirteen suspended ships. The remaining ships will remain in Shanghai and wait quietly. If the problem cannot be resolved after the "Xin Jiangtian" sails, then the suspension can be resumed upon its return to Shanghai. The representatives decided to accept the proposal and issued a notice at 4:00 PM, allowing the "Xin Jiangtian" to resume sailing first. It departed at 5:30 PM. The meeting also issued a notice stating: "The issue of double wages for colleagues is now being negotiated by the representatives and mediators Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Quanwu. There is no doubt about double wages, and they will be responsible for resolving it. It is hoped that the 'Xin Jiangtian' will be sent out first today. The remaining ships can wait quietly at the port. If a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached, the suspension can be resumed after the 'Xin Jiangtian' returns to Shanghai. Colleagues, in order to respect the opinions of the mediators, agree to allow the ship to sail today. Special notice."</p>
<p>Reporting to the Military Department: The association sent an urgent telegraph to the Military and Political Department yesterday, which was forwarded to the Minister of Communications, stating that the Merchant Steamship Company sailors requested equal treatment and double wages with the bureau staff due to the company's unfair treatment. Guo Waifeng stubbornly refused and threatened to resign, causing the sailors to be in a desperate situation, leading to unexpected events. The responsibility lies entirely with Commissioner Guo. The sailors are determined to fight for personality and justice. In addition to being determined to wait for the bureau to issue double wages, they can drive to various ports and continue their daily work as usual. There are no other actions. In addition, the "Jiangyu" ship is currently used for military purposes and urgently needs to be transported. In order to facilitate military affairs and support the government, colleagues decided to order the ship's employees to sail as usual. I hereby state the truth. The telegraph was reported. (The following is omitted)</p>
<p>Bilateral Consultation: At 7:00 PM yesterday, Du's residence called a meeting of representatives of sailors and stokers to Du's residence to consult with the two mediators, Du and Quan, on a solution. The representatives went around 7:00 PM. While reporters were drafting this manuscript, the two sides were still consulting. The result will be discussed and decided today.</p>
<p>Shipping Situation: The Merchant Steamship Company's suspension has lasted for three days. It is currently the peak season for cargo transport in the Yangtze River and the North and South Seas, resulting in huge losses in operations. Yesterday, the Sanbei Company took this opportunity to add the new ship "Songpu" to the Yangtze River route in order to intercept the cargo and passengers of the Merchant Steamship Company. Cargo and passengers in the North and South Seas were loaded by Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships. Therefore, the "Fusheng," "Shuntian," and "Zhangzhou" ships had more cargo and passengers than usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Government: Guo Waifeng, Commissioner of the General Administration Office of the Reorganization of the Merchant Steamship Company of the National Government, sent an official letter to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the sudden strike by the company's river and sea sailors on the 8th, citing the issue of year-end double wages, a total of twelve ships arriving at the port have been incited to join. Declarations have also been published in newspapers and presented to party and government agencies. However, the contents stated are inconsistent with the current situation and are absurd. The treatment of the company's sailors is more than twice that of the company's employees. Since the special commissioner was ordered to reorganize the company, the arrears of sailors' salaries have been paid for more than two months. Everything that can benefit the sailors has been done to the best of our ability. In addition to actively reforming currency treasures, we have also followed regulations and customs to care for all internal and external employees without any favoritism. However, the sailors disregarded national transportation and went on strike. Even after being advised to resume sailing, they turned a deaf ear. Although this is a dispute within the company, transportation is involved, and I am afraid it will affect local security. I hereby send a letter to your noble municipal government, requesting you to order the relevant departments to jointly find a way to mediate and quickly resolve the situation and resume sailing, in order to prevent future hidden dangers in the area. Public and private sectors will be grateful. Sincerely, Wu, Mayor of Shanghai Municipal Government; Guo Waifeng, Commissioner of the General Administration Office of the Reorganization of the Merchant Steamship Company of the National Government."</p>
<p>Advising to Resume Sailing: Guo Waifeng, Commissioner of the Merchant Steamship Company, issued a notice to all sailors on the river and sea ships yesterday, stating: "Regarding the fact that the company's river and sea sailors suddenly declared a strike and suspended sailing due to the issue of double wages and published a declaration and reported to party and government agencies, the contents listed are inconsistent with the current situation. It is even said that the special commissioner is used by others to oppress sailors. I was surprised after reading it. Since I was ordered to come to the bureau last May, the first thing I did was to request the National Government to cancel the bonus. The purpose of this is to seek internal and external balance and expect equal treatment. After approval, the bonus will be cancelled. The twentieth-year business department's cargo loading comparison still exceeds the regulations, but the bonus will be stopped from now on. The sailors are still using this as a reason to demand double wages, which is ignorant of the fact that the yellow flowers are tomorrow. In addition, during the previous Zhao Shou era, the salaries of sailors on each ship were in arrears, many for four or five months, and at least two or one month. The sailors' meals and miscellaneous expenses were issued with long-term checks, which were often difficult to cash when due, which affected the sailors' livelihoods. After I took over, I deeply sympathized with the sailors' situation and tried my best to find a way to solve the problem. I first actively raised and issued all the arrears of salaries for each month on each ship, regardless of the amount, and changed all the meals and miscellaneous expenses of each ship to cash. Everything that can benefit the sailors has been properly taken care of. I have done my best to love and protect the sailors. What is the oppression of the sailors? As for the fact that the bureau staff enjoys year-end double wages, but the sailors do not, which is considered a clear proof of unfair treatment, let alone the fact that the special commissioner handles this matter purely in accordance with old rules and takes into account industry practices, and I have no favoritism. Even just in terms of treatment, who is more or less, the bureau staff or the sailors, is difficult to say. For example, the upper-level sailors are provided with Western food, which costs 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per month. The lower-level sailors also increased the rice subsidy by 4 yuan per person per month last year. When the rice was cheap, it was not deducted. The total number of staff in the general office is the same as that of the upper-level sailors, and the monthly meal is only about 1,000 yuan. This is also a habit. The difference is so huge. Otherwise, the sailors are Chinese, and it is natural to provide Chinese food, which will save twice as much. In addition, sailors can ask for leave for illness, and the bureau will send a representative, who will be paid the original salary, and the representative must be paid separately. In recent years, sailors have asked for leave more often, and the bureau's losses may not be less than one month's double wages. However, the bureau staff mostly ask colleagues to handle their affairs, and there is no cost of sending a representative. In addition, medical care and compensation are stipulated by the Maritime Law, and there is no need to list them one by one. If you want to seek equality, then just reform the two matters of meals and leave, so that it is the same as the bureau staff. Do you want the sailors? The feet are long, and the inches are short. If you want to be fair, you must first reflect on yourself. I hope that all the sailors will not only hope for the one-month double wages of the bureau staff, but also think about the usual favoritism. You must be calm and peaceful, and there is nothing to compete for. In short, I have no intention to refuse the sailors' request for double pay, but it is not allowed to consider the precedents and the fairness of the treatment. It is not reasonable to allow it suddenly, and whether the current financial resources of the bureau can afford this additional huge expense is also known to all internal and external staff. The sailors only know that the bureau has a capital of 50 million yuan, but the estimated value is only more than 28 million taels, and they do not know that the annual debt interest is more than 2 million yuan. Every year, there has been a long-standing deficit, and it is difficult to support it. If you do not measure the bureau's difficulties, you will inevitably make excessive demands, which will consume more and more, and production will not increase. If the beams and rafters break, you will eventually be crushed. I am worried about the future. At this time of national crisis and when the goods are being shipped smoothly, each ship is fully loaded and sits in the river. The daily losses are immeasurable. If you understand the big picture, how can you make this? Resume classes and sailing immediately, and do not delay. I have always been fair and sincere in treating my subordinates. I hereby sincerely inform you, and I hope you will all abide by it."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's Inquiry Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting Commander He to Defend Shanhaiguan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held a standing committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Chu Huiseng. It was decided to hold an executive committee meeting at the Ningbo Association Hall at 4:00 PM on Monday, the 11th of this month, to discuss the rectification of association affairs and future directions in order to seek a comprehensive solution, and to notify all departments to serve normally. After the fall of Jinzhou, the situation in Shanhaiguan became urgent. A telegram was sent to Commander He of the garrison to firmly defend and resist. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Urgent, Commander He of Shanhaiguan, after the fall of Jinzhou, the tyrannical Japanese continue to invade. Shanhaiguan is located at a strategic location and is the gateway to Pingjin. I beg you to firmly defend and resist to protect the border. We have led all the citizens to swear to be the backing. Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association."</p>
<h3>Fujian Delegation Hosted All Sectors Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai Sent Representatives to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, representatives of various Fujian organizations hosted various local organizations at the Shanghai YMCA. Representatives from secondary schools' anti-Japanese national salvation joint associations, Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association representatives Wu Yu, Feng Yuxiang representative Wang Daoyu, and Fujian natives association in Shanghai and other 40+ organizations attended. Firstly, Chen Zhihao, Chairman of the delegation, reported, stating: "On the 2nd of this month, when Fuzhou students were conducting a national salvation propaganda in West Lake Park, the Japanese consul in Fujian, accompanied by the captain of the northbound warship, disguised themselves and tore up slogans and fired guns to demonstrate. Later, they were protected by the military police and left. However, they did not blame themselves and instead made serious representations to the provincial government. The next night (the 3rd), Japanese couple Mito Sanshio were killed in the Japanese Club residence. The place was heavily guarded, with military police standing. After this incident, the Japanese consul falsely accused the Chinese of the murder, causing a great disturbance, deploying troops and ships, and making unreasonable demands of five conditions, limiting the Fujian Provincial Government to respond within 24 hours. The provincial government succumbed and actually acknowledged it, causing the people's anger and resentment to be unable to extend. Therefore, they sent people to Shanghai to request assistance from all sectors." Then, Wu Mai, representative of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association, and Wang Daoyu, representative of Feng Yuxiang, gave speeches in succession. Their words were impassioned and the whole audience was angry. Subsequently, three concrete measures were proposed by all sectors: 1) All sectors will convene a meeting immediately to send a telegram to the whole country to request assistance. 2) All sectors will request the central government to make serious representations to Japan. 3) All sectors will send representatives to Beijing to petition and severely punish the Fujian Provincial Government that is flattering foreigners and humiliating the country. The meeting ended at about 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Association Plans to Aid Compatriots in Japan</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Northeast issue, no less than thousands of overseas Chinese in Japan have lost their jobs and returned to their country. It has been heard that there are still 22 unemployed overseas Chinese in Japan from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, wandering from various parts of Kyushu, Japan, to Nagasaki. There are also 16 fishermen from Dinghai County who were shipwrecked and drifted to Japan, urgently awaiting repatriation. The directors of the Sanjiang Association in Nagasaki, Zichang and others, telegraphed the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, asking them to find ways to provide relief to avoid being stranded in a foreign land. After receiving the telegram, the association, in addition to forwarding a letter to the Wenzhou Association in Shanghai to find a solution, has already telegraphed the Sanjiang Association regarding the Ningbo fishermen, requesting them to advance funds to be sent back to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Dispute at Nisshin Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>Failure to Pay Workers' Wages</p>
<p>The Nisshin First Cotton Mill in Gordon Road, Puxi, has been greatly affected by the boycott of Japanese goods in China, and its business has declined sharply, making it almost unsustainable. Therefore, it came up with the fantastic idea of arbitrarily oppressing and increasing the workload of a large number of workers, deducting wages, forcing the workers to resign and quit, and refusing to allow the workers to enter the factory to work yesterday afternoon, in order to achieve its goal of closing the factory. All wages, labor bonuses, etc. that the workers should have received were not paid, causing more than 2,000 workers in the factory to be extremely angry and are currently holding a general meeting to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Business Administration Association Banquets Feng Ji</h3>
<p>At 12:00 noon yesterday, the Chinese Business Administration Association held a meeting on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs to welcome Mr. Feng Huanzhang. Over 100 people attended, presided over by Kong Xiangxi, who said that Mr. Feng is not only an outstanding talent in China, but also an outstanding talent in the world. Our organization is of a research nature. Mr. Feng's speech today will surely give us very beneficial guidance. Feng then gave a speech, saying that listening to Mr. Kong just now, I felt infinitely emotional when I heard that your association is a professional research organization of scientific management. The corruption of Chinese national affairs lies in the lack of scientific management spirit. What is learned is often not what is used, and what is learned is not what is used. In the late Qing Dynasty, the acting official was omnipotent, and he was called flying all over the sky. What is the director? Supervisor? Director General? Platoon leader? None of them were managed by acting officials. As a result, the world of the Qing Dynasty was lost. Since the Republic of China, it has become the omnipotence of the military. What is the governor of the province? Hall chief? Committee member? Chairman? None of them are military tyrants occupying them. What did you ask him to learn? He learned the left, right, left, and right. What did you ask him to know? He knew how to drag a gun and count one, two, three, four, but he insisted on handling political affairs, holding a large group of laymen to impersonate experts, so how can national affairs not get worse and worse? I believe that why not find professional scientists to design and be responsible for the country in the future, then the future is very difficult, so I advocate that all management of the country in the future should be scientific. In short, it is to scientifically manage the country. I am a crude person who dropped out of school in his childhood, but I know that I have many things that are laymen and there are mistakes. Please give me your advice. Cao Yunxiang then gave a speech, saying that I personally saw Mr. Feng's soldiers helping the people to push cars and helping the people to pull cars when I was in Kaifeng Prefecture. This is a phenomenon that is not found in the whole of China, so training troops is Mr. Feng's expertise, which is well known. It will never be a layman. We hope that Mr. Feng will specialize in training troops for the country in the future. The troops trained by Mr. Feng will definitely be able to fight the Japanese, and they will definitely not take the policy of non-resistance. Jiang Hengyuan's speech was long and not recorded.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Statement on Stopping Seeing Guests</h3>
<p>It is reported that a letter came from Wang Gongguan's Secret Office on the 9th, saying that the recent reports in various Shanghai newspapers about Mr. Wang meeting guests are slightly inconsistent with the facts. During the interim of the fourth session of the first central provincial conference, Mr. Wang was unable to attend due to illness. There were many important issues that the committee members had to come to Shanghai to discuss with Mr. Wang in person. At that time, Mr. Wang spoke too much, which aggravated his illness. After this (after the end of the full meeting), he followed the doctor's advice and stopped seeing guests and focused on recuperating. The recent reports of talking with a certain public official for 30 minutes and talking with a certain public official for 50 minutes are not true. According to the doctor, in the shortest period of time, he can not only not see guests, but also not read newspapers, because only in this way can he have the possibility of recovering his health in a considerable period of time. Now I am afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth and is prone to misunderstandings. I hereby make a statement based on the facts and respectfully publish it in the newspapers, so as not to fail to welcome those who come to visit Mr. Wang. Wang Gong reported to the secretariat on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Guo Bingwen Resigns as Director of the Customs Administration</h3>
<p>It is said that Guo Bingwen, the newly appointed Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, is going to Beijing to prepare to take over the post. It is not true. It is heard that Mr. Guo has firmly resigned to the Ministry because he is unable to cope with the heavy workload of the Director of the Customs Administration.</p>
<h3>Indian People in Shanghai Will Hold a General Meeting</h3>

<h3>Special News from the Aviation Industry</h3>
<p>Qinghe Runs Aground: The Shanghai steamer Qinghe of Jardine Matheson's ship, this time went upstream to Junqing. On the 5th of this month, the ship was traveling above Wanxian. Due to the reduction of the river water, it ran aground. The hull was stranded on the reef, and the bottom of the ship was pierced, with two holes. The river water immediately flooded into the ship, and the goods were damaged. The shipowner temporarily plugged the holes with cement, drained the accumulated water, and reluctantly drove to Chongqing. Yesterday, the Shanghai office telegraphed the ship to unload the goods and then open to Shanghai for overhaul.</p>
<p>Taishun Fire: The Taishun ship of the Merchant Steamship Bureau was loading goods in Shanghai this time and planned to go to Beiyang, but the strike started just as the passengers and goods were loaded, so it was not successful. Hundreds of bales of cotton were loaded on the upper deck of the ship. Unexpectedly, a fire suddenly broke out. The fire spread very quickly for a while. Only when the fire broke through did the shipowner and others learn about it and immediately took leather straps to absorb water and shoot. The fire brigade also drove the dragons to help put out the fire. The fire was finally extinguished, burning several bales of cotton. The ship's hull was not affected, but there was a lot of water on the deck. The cause of the fire is unknown and is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Appointment of Section Chiefs for Dredging Yu Tang</h3>
<p>Regarding the dredging project of the Yu Tang River in Shanghai County, all procedures have been prepared by the River Works Office. It is now planned to implement the earth excavation during this sunny winter season. However, with the river stretching two hundred and ten li, it is difficult to effectively oversee the work. Therefore, following the method of recruiting labor for road construction, seventeen individuals with river works experience were selected from the dredging maps to serve as section chiefs, so as to direct the village chiefs in supervising the earthworkers' dredging, for the benefit of the river works. Sun Shiben, the director of the River Works General Office, submitted a list to the county government for appointment. Yesterday, County Magistrate Yan issued an order approving the request, and appointed Qiao Fu, Lu Zhaoxiang, Lu Mingru, Guo Jingfu, Ling Yengeng, Jiang Fengyi, and six others as section chiefs of the North Bridge River Works General Office. Yu Yuxiang, Cao Yazhou, Yang Rusheng, Chen Shen'an, and four others were appointed as section chiefs of the Tangwan Branch Office.

<h3>Representatives of the French Municipal Council Chinese Association Petitioned the Municipal Government Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the Dismissal of Chinese Staff by the Council</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council of this city implemented a staff reduction plan on December 2 last year, planning to dismiss 217 Chinese employees. Including the workers laid off in November, the total was 242. The Chinese Association of the Council sent representatives to the municipal government on December 8 to petition. After accepting the petition, the municipal government verbally negotiated with the French authorities and sent a letter to the Council to inquire. Many days have passed, but the Council has not yet replied, causing the case to remain unresolved. The Association again sent representatives Shen Caigeng, Yang Wugang, Sun Shanhai, Fan Agui, Gu Xigeng, and others to the municipal government yesterday to petition. The receiving secretary, Geng Jizhi, met with them and promised to send another letter to the French authorities to negotiate strictly. The result was extremely satisfactory.</p>
<h3>The Datong Music Society Will Film a Sound Movie</h3>
<p>A Precursor to the Westward Spread of National Music</p>
<p>The Datong Music Society of this port recently received an official letter from the Ministry of Education stating that the League of Nations had appointed experts to China to investigate the true state of cultural life, and intended to request the Society to perform national music and film it into a sound movie to promote it to various countries around the world. The Society convened all its members last Sunday afternoon to discuss the matter, and replied to the Ministry of Education, agreeing to do so. It also summoned members and experts from other locations to Shanghai to join the performance, totaling about fifty people. Preparations will be made for two weeks before filming. It is said that the content is quite extensive, including more than 160 kinds of ancient and modern musical instruments and 11 kinds of dance instruments, divided into two major categories: solo and ensemble, mostly high-quality works for public enjoyment. It is certain to create a unique style in world music and strive for a ray of glory for our inherent culture. In the future, if music and ritual flourish and the old system of the Grand Master of Music of the Zhou Dynasty can be restored, the future of national music will be immeasurable. According to Director Zheng of the Society, this initiative lacks neither talent nor musical instruments, but the funding issue is quite difficult due to the lack of a foundation.</p>
<h3>Change of Director of the Military Police Corps Office</h3>
<p>Wang Tianming, the chief of staff of the tax police corps, concurrently served as the director of the Zhabei Military Police Corps Joint Office. Recently, the tax police corps was ordered to go to Songjiang and left Shanghai the day before yesterday. All duties as director have been resigned to the municipal government garrison headquarters to relieve responsibility. It has been approved, and Zhang Junsong, the commander of the Sixth Corps of the 78th Division and concurrently the commander of the Shanghai North China, has been appointed to succeed him.</p>
<h3>First Landowners' Association in the Central District</h3>
<p>Since the first public land release in the central district of Shanghai last July, the Engineering Bureau has been actively carrying out road construction projects. Former Mayor Zhang, in order to strengthen public trust and demonstrate fairness, issued a clear order on December 22 last year to establish a Construction Fund Management Committee for the central district area to manage funds and allocate expenditures, and also announced that landowners should elect two representatives as committee members. It is now known that the eleven landowners in the first land release have formed the first Landowners' Association in the central district and have elected the Bank of China (represented by Xia Pingfang) and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank (represented by Dong Chengdao) as representatives of the first landowners and submitted them to the municipal government for record. The newly appointed Mayor Wu has made a declaration that the construction of Greater Shanghai will be actively carried out so that various plans will be completed one by one, then the prosperity of the central district area must be realized soon, it can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Record of the Xu-Xi Wedding</h3>
<p>Xu Pei, the dean of the School of Commerce at Central University, and the famous Miss Xi Baozhen held their wedding ceremony at the Yipinxin Hotel at 5 pm yesterday. Xu has a wide circle of friends, and more than 500 people from the political, business, and academic circles came to congratulate him, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jilun, Fang Jiaobo, Yuan Ludun, Wang Jingqi, Xu Zazhen, Li Lishen, Chen Xing, Qi Zhi, Li Zhaosui, Wang Xianhua, Cao Lianglu, and others. During the wedding, Xu's elder brother, Xu Juntao, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, officiated, and Yu Qiaqing was the witness. In the evening, a banquet was held at Yipinxin to entertain the Chinese and foreign guests, who gathered together until late at night, and then dispersed in joy.</p>
<h3>Western Horse Racing Harms Farmers</h3>
<p>Request to the County Government for Negotiation</p>
<p>The Westerners' paper-scattering horse racing was previously banned due to damage to farmland. Unexpectedly, recently, more than a hundred Western men and women rode horses from Shanghai, passing west through Qianliang Temple in the county, passing through Huajing Guan Port to the south, and turning north to Caoxing Town, returning from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. These Westerners did not follow the roads, but arbitrarily galloped in the farmland, trampling on broad beans, rapeseed, wheat seedlings, etc., causing considerable damage. The county's Public Security Second Sub-bureau immediately dissuaded them to no avail. Therefore, Director Zhao reported the situation to the County National Government yesterday, requesting an investigation and negotiation.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Pingjili Road Last Night</h3>
<p>At about 10 o'clock last night, four robbers suddenly came to Shengda Pawnshop at No. 131, the intersection of Pingjili Road and Rue Lafayette in the French Concession. Three robbers held guns, and one robber closed the front door, forbidding anyone from making a sound and wantonly looting. After about an hour, they fled with their loot. After a detailed inspection, the lost items were estimated to be about 4,000 yuan. The owner then provided a list of lost items and reported it to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Appeal Against Excessive Extortion on Lime Boats</h3>
<p>Several dozen tin gang boat owners, including Qian Ating and Qian Peirong, submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that they transport first-class lime from various lime kilns in Yixing to Shanghai for sale. Unexpectedly, Xu Shengfang, Zhou Jinfang, Ma Shaoquan, and others initiated the Lime Transportation and Sales Association, and in the name of the association, they sent people to wharves such as Caojiadu and Tanziwan in western Shanghai to collect fees from lime boats at a rate of one-third of a dan (unit of weight), and forced them to only sell at business locations, depriving the boat owners of their freedom to sell. Because Qian Ating's boat did not pay the fee, the water patrol team was brought along to detain the boat owner's son, Qian Xuelin. Qian Peirong's boat had its oars, masts, and splints taken away. However, the association is organized in the name of a business, and its main body has nothing to do with the boat owners. The behavior is inevitably harassing and demanding. They request an investigation and release of the arrested person. Otherwise, dozens of ships will have to simultaneously request the bureau to maintain their livelihoods and resort to extremes. After receiving the petition, the bureau has consulted the Public Security Bureau for verification and handling.</p>
<h3>Police Detective Arrests Two More Robbers</h3>
<p>The home of Yong native Zhu Shende at No. 21 Chunyang Lane, Qiazibuzaitou, No. 4 Youheng Road, was invaded by five robbers at around 6:30 the night before last. Detective Zheng Huaili, No. 308 of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, who lived in the same house, fired a shot and wounded one robber, capturing him on the spot. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Detective Zheng went to his elder brother's place at No. 1174 near Sheng Road, Pingliang Road for lunch. Suddenly, he saw three people passing by outside the door, and he suddenly remembered that their faces resembled the robbers who had been in his house the night before. Therefore, he went out to stop them. Unexpectedly, the robbers were already alarmed. One of them, wearing a suit, took out a gun and tried to fire, but Zheng preemptively fired five shots, hitting and capturing two robbers. One robber took the opportunity to escape without a trace. When Zheng fired, Wang Xuanhao, an employee of the Tianyi Silk Factory, happened to be passing by. A stray bullet hit his left leg, and he went to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He was not seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Dispute at the Kangfu Confectionery Factory</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Accepts Mediation</p>
<p>The Kangfu Confectionery Factory at Jiandao Bridge, Humin South Zhelu Road, Nanshi, was organized by Shi Xilin (28 years old) and others from Haining. It was opened in the spring of last year and specializes in selling machine-made chocolate candies. The business is still developing. The manager is Xie Songtang. On New Year's Eve last year, shareholder Shi Xilin suddenly came to the factory and announced that all workers in the hired machine room would work from 6:30 am to 8:30 pm. Manager Xie advised against it, believing that 14 hours of work per day was not in the interest of protecting laborers. Shi refused, and the two had a disagreement. Xie then resigned. When the workers heard about it, they rose up in opposition. According to the factory's custom, double pay is given every December. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, Shi personally distributed the pay and asked the workers to sign. However, afterwards, he suddenly announced that all workers should leave their jobs because Shi added the words "Worker Retirement Money" to the list signed by the workers. Thereupon, the workers knew they had been fooled and refused to leave the factory. The shareholders used the "Worker Retirement Money" list as evidence of voluntary resignation. Therefore, yesterday morning, the factory sent the workers Zhou Delin and Zhou Jinsheng to the Second District Public Security Bureau for detention. When the workers learned of this, 13 machine workers submitted a detailed account of the incident, requesting assistance from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has accepted this mediation.</p>
<h3>Fire at a Clothing Shop in Baxianqiao</h3>
<p>At 9:25 last night, a fire suddenly broke out at Che Bingji Clothing Shop, No. 52 Yinyuli, Liselou Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession. It could not be contained and quickly spread. The Grand Bell and the Songshan Fire Brigade heard the alarm and drove to the scene to put out the fire. After about half an hour of spraying, the fire was completely extinguished, but only the three-story pavilion and the attic were destroyed, and the loss was still small.</p>
<h3>Fire Alarm on Funing Road, Yangshupu</h3>
<p>A fire broke out at Longgenji Flower Clothing Factory, No. 270 Funing Road, Yangshupu, at 7:40 yesterday morning. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire, and it was quickly extinguished.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ruihe's 90th Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>Initiated by Yu Qiaqing, Huang Jinrong, and others</p>

They would handle it when the district chief arrived. I immediately told the soldiers, who were very satisfied.

I said that the explanation was very satisfactory at the time, how could they not disperse? He said there were other reasons.

I immediately ordered the tea room of the District Party Headquarters to quickly call the artillery team at the railway station to explain, because they caused the trouble. Later, I took a hat and was pushed into a hardware store by the people. I heard gunshots, I don't know where they came from. (Asked) You must know if anyone was killed.

<h3>Starvation Deaths of Disaster Victims on the Jianghua Ship</h3>
<p>The impact of the crew's work stoppage</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's crew members' request for double pay at the end of the year led to a work stoppage, which has lasted for four days. All ships are docked at the pier. It is known that the company's Yangtze River Jianghua ship was originally scheduled to be boarded free of charge by the company on the 7th to go to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The city's Disaster Relief Committee had 86 disaster victims from Hubei who were transported to Jiujiang, Mianyang, and other places to return to their hometowns. On the evening of the 7th, they were transported and boarded the Jianghua ship, which was approved by the company for free passage. Each adult was given 2 yuan for food, and each child was given 1 yuan for food, which was handed over to the ship's purser for safekeeping to be used for food. Unexpectedly, the ship stopped sailing on that day due to the crew's demand for wages, causing the disaster victims in the lower艙 to not only have no hope of returning to their hometowns, but also had nothing to eat. As of yesterday, they had been starving for three days and were on the verge of death. Among them, an old woman named Yang Xu, age 58, could not bear the hunger and collapsed in the cabin at 3 p.m. yesterday and died. After being discovered by someone, it was reported to the court for inspection and collection of the body. At the same time, the Disaster Relief Committee received the news and sent staff to the Jianghua ship's pier last night to distribute food to the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of Monthly Bonuses at Two Japanese Factories Causes Disputes</h3>
<p>The old silk factory has been resolved</p>
<p>The Rihua Yarn Factory has no solution yet</p>
<p>Part of the workers at the Dongyang Silk Factory on Houmalu Road in Caojiadu, West Shanghai, and all the workers at the Rihua Yarn Factory on Robert Seng Road went on strike yesterday morning because the factory suddenly canceled their monthly bonuses. The details of the incident are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Old Silk Factory</h3>
<p>Dongyang on Houmalu Road in Caojiadu</p>
<p>The old silk factory also has a new factory in Singapore Road. There are a total of eight or nine hundred workers. The business has been developing and profitable in recent years. As a general rule, the factory provides a monthly bonus of eight工 for each worker out of consideration and encouragement. At the end of each month, it is issued by name (all Japanese factories have this monthly bonus, but there are slight differences in the amount). Recently, various Japanese factories have suffered losses due to the impact of boycotts. Maintaining operations has been difficult to support. After repeated meetings by the Japanese factories, it was decided to cancel the monthly bonus across the board from last month to reduce expenses. After the factory announced the cancellation, all the workers, because the cost of living is increasing day by day and they work hard for a month, rely on this monthly bonus to make up for the shortfall. They repeatedly requested the factory to issue it, but it was ineffective. Therefore, a part of the factory's workers, about one hundred and dozens of people, went on strike after arriving at the factory yesterday morning. Ren, the district chief of the Sixth District Police Station, immediately led Inspector Xu to the factory after receiving the report. After comforting the workers and mediating with the Japanese factory, the factory agreed in the afternoon to give half the bonus each month, that is, each person gets four 工 each month. The workers were grateful for District Chief Ren's sincere mediation, so a peaceful resolution was reached. All the workers also went to work and returned to normal.</p>
<h3>Rihua Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>The factory has always given a monthly bonus of only four 工 to each worker. Now that the factory has announced the cancellation, all the workers, about two thousand people, are very panicked. They also went on strike yesterday morning, demanding that the factory issue the bonus as before. After receiving the report, District Chief Ren of the Sixth District immediately ordered Inspector Gu of the First Branch to lead the police to maintain order. On one hand, he personally led Inspector Xu to the factory to persuade and mediate with the factory and all the workers. Because the workers are struggling to make a living, their attitude is very firm, and the factory has suffered too much loss due to the boycott, so there is still no resolution by the evening.</p>
<h3>The Rihua Factory Storm is Difficult to Resolve</h3>
<p>More than 300 female workers in the cloth machine room of the Pudong Rihua Yarn Factory went on strike at the end of last year because they refused to accept the factory's deduction of wages. After several mediations by the authorities, the two sides became extreme and are about to break up. The workers in each room also provided financial assistance and urged the workers in that room to adhere to the original agreement and not to make any more concessions, in order to fall for the Japanese traitors' tricks. The female workers also took a firm attitude and went to work in various Chinese yarn factories in Puxi in batches for days to persevere. The Rihua branch office of the Fifth District Textile Workers' Union issued a letter to all workers in the city yesterday, appealing for assistance. The wording is omitted.</p>
<h3>The Jing'an Temple Monk May Settle the Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The abbot of Jing'an Temple, Zhiwen, was ill and entrusted his younger brother, Zhifa, to act as the abbot. Unexpectedly, Zhiwen recovered from his illness and returned to the temple, but Zhiba refused to move out, resulting in a lawsuit in court, which has not been resolved. It is now heard that both parties have repented, believing that monks should have no worldly possessions and should not be involved in endless lawsuits. Therefore, they have each asked powerful people to mediate a reconciliation.</p>
<h3>A Woman Carries More Than 10,000 Red Pills</h3>
<p>Six months of imprisonment...60 yuan fine</p>
<p>Inspector Yao Jialin of the China Patrol learned that someone was selling red pills for profit at house number 189, Burton Road, so the day before yesterday, he secretly went to search the place with Chinese and Western police. They saw a Jiangxi woman, Fu Jin, holding two white cloth bags, preparing to go out to sell them. They were immediately stopped and searched. The bags were filled with red pills, with a total of more than 10,000 pills. They also found 80 yuan in paper money in her pocket, as well as an account book and a notebook, all of which recorded the sales of red pills. They were all brought into the Hongkou Police Station. The police chief ordered her to be transferred to the women's detention center for temporary detention. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Special Court, Court One. After Judge Xiao interrogated Fu Jin, he immediately sentenced her to six months of imprisonment and a fine of 60 yuan. If she could not pay the fine, she would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The paper money, notebook, and red pills were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Pawnbroking an Niece into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Wang Daheng, a resident of Zhenjiang living at No. 204 North Jiangxi Road in Shanghai, had a niece named Zhang Fengying, aged sixteen. When she was seven, her mother, Zhang Wang, entrusted her to Wang's care. Unexpectedly, Wang colluded with a Suzhou woman, Sun Jiang, and on September 15th of last year, sold Zhang Fengying to a woman surnamed Zhang at No. 275 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, to become a private prostitute. They received 350 silver dollars from the transaction. The case was discovered by the girl's mother, Zhang Wang, who came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang some days ago and hired a lawyer to report the matter to the Hongkou Police Station. Detective Bao Shuji was dispatched to arrest Wang Daheng and Sun Jiang one after another, and the girl Zhang Fengying was rescued. All were handed over to the First Special District Court. Zhang Wang accused Wang Daheng, as Fengying's maternal uncle, of improperly selling his niece into prostitution and demanded severe punishment. Wang Daheng brazenly claimed that his niece Fengying had volunteered for such a life of physical labor and that the money obtained would be used to prepare her fiancé's betrothal gifts. Zhang Fengying was ordered to be returned to her mother to return to her hometown, and the two defendants were detained pending a scheduled sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieqiao rendered the verdict in the First Higher Court, sentencing Wang Daheng to six months of imprisonment and Sun Jiang to three months of imprisonment. The number of days of detention prior to the final judgment will be used to offset the imprisonment at a rate of two days offsetting one day.</p>
<h3>A Monstrosity in Pudong</h3>
<p>Cat-headed, Green-eyed Creature Thrown to Death After Birth</p>
<p>A local man named Jiang, who lives near Shenjia Lane in Pudong and makes a living by rowing boats, married a woman surnamed Mou. They already have two sons. Around February last year, the wife became pregnant. Recently, her belly became very large, and on the night before last, she gave birth to a monster. It had a large head with a pointed snout that already had teeth, resembling a cat. The ears pointed upwards, almost identical to cat ears. The eyes were green, and the hands and feet were extremely small. The chest and abdomen were similar to a human's body. Jiang was shocked upon seeing it and gathered his neighbors to observe. None of them knew what it was. Jiang then threw the monster to the ground, killing it. That night, he hung it on a roadside fence to show the public and prevent it from being reincarnated. The superstition of ignorant commoners is evident. Yesterday morning, a man nicknamed "He Yun the Blind" saw it and was amazed. He immediately took it down to the rural area east of Yangjing Temple and shouted, attracting a crowd of farmers. He charged each person two copper coins for a look, earning six or seven hundred copper coins in a short time. Later, fearing being caught by the police and suffering undeserved disaster, he threw it into a toilet and left. According to the report, this monster was likely due to a physiological anomaly.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: The weather will be clear and cold. There is fog in several places along the Yangtze River and along the coast here. There will be occasional seasonal winds over the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, from the northwest and northeast. Unstable wind and rain in northern Shandong due to a low-pressure system passing through Mongolia and moving towards the southeast-east. Also, the local temperature in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday was a maximum of 45.5 and a minimum of 21.2. On the same day last year, due to drastic weather changes, there were no maximum or minimum temperatures.</p>

<h3>From Burning Coal Stoves to Education (Part 2)</h3>
<p>However, thatch fire has its uses. I learned to burn a coal stove this year. First, put some thatch or paper balls at the bottom of the stove, and cover it with a handful of kindling. Kindling is burned pine charcoal. Next, light the thatch. When the thatch turns to ash, the kindling is burning red. Then, put bituminous coal on top of the kindling. When the kindling turns to ash, the bituminous coal is emitting fierce flames. Finally, cover it with anthracite coal. When the bituminous coal turns to ash, the anthracite coal is already a roaring fire. After that, just keep adding anthracite coal and removing the coal ash, and this stove of roaring fire can burn for a lifetime without being extinguished.</p>
<p>This process of burning coal is like the process of education. Thatch burns kindling, kindling burns bituminous coal, and bituminous coal burns anthracite coal. This order cannot be reversed, or it will be against nature, and labor will be in vain. Relying solely on thatch to start a fire is certainly not possible. Using thatch to directly burn anthracite coal will not work either. Thatch turning to ash cannot ignite anthracite coal. There are three kinds of people in China: one kind uses only thatch to start a fire; one kind likes to pour water on the thatch fire; and one kind uses thatch to quickly burn anthracite coal. Therefore, the life of the Chinese nation has not yet ignited an unquenchable flame, and has not yet emitted sunlight-like brightness.</p>
<p>What is the mission of education? It is not to start a thatch fire, nor to extinguish a thatch fire! It is to ignite the flame of life and emit the light of life according to the process of burning coal. The mission of Chinese education is to ignite the flame of the Chinese nation's life and emit the light of the Chinese nation's life according to the process of burning coal. The mission of world education is also to ignite the flame of all humanity's life and emit the light of all humanity's life according to the process of burning coal.</p>
<h3>Wu Luzhen Sells Shunfeng</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Lu Gaojian in front of the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou is a well-known cooked meat shop in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. What is called "Shunfeng" is made by chopping the ears of piglets. General Wu Luzhen was not a butcher. How could there be a sale of "Shunfeng"? It turned out that the general once in anger drew his white blade and chopped off the ears of a Japanese slave. At that time, Luzhen was the Border Affairs Minister of Yanji, stern and upright, unparalleled for a time. The Japanese residents in eastern provinces were all terrified by his great name and dared not provoke him in the slightest. One day, when a Japanese consul came to visit, the car was parked outside the gate. Luzhen's commissioner ordered the driver to move it to the side of the road so as not to obstruct traffic. The driver did not know that he was a commissioner, whipped him and insulted him. The commissioner was fluent in Japanese and argued with him. The driver whipped him again, became more aggressive, and added to the insult. The commissioner had no choice but to report to Luzhen. Luzhen was furious and immediately ordered the arrest of the rude driver, grabbed his left ear, and personally used a short blade to chop it off. Blood dripped down, staining his clothes and shoulders red. The driver fell to the ground in pain. The consul questioned him. Luzhen shouted at him, "If you don't know what's good for you and keep babbling, the driver's right ear will also lose its position!" The consul was intimidated and dared not say a word. It became a common story. Luzhen, also known as Shouqing, had revolutionary ideas. During the restoration, Luzhen made many plans, which the Qing court resented. He was assassinated in Shijiazhuang. A generation of heroes was buried in the yellow earth. It is a pity that Luzhen was good at poetry. He composed many poems, such as following Wang Wusheng's original rhyme for keeping watch on New Year's Eve: "The shuttle throws two balls, letting them come and go. White clouds are forever leisurely. All my life I have leaned on rice to float on the vast sea. Ten thousand miles of wind and clouds, I look towards the old mountains. Drunken eyes re-invite the Yan city moon. Hoofprints have spread across the Han dynasty passes. Stroking my thighs, I feel more melancholic. Old traces are endlessly looked up to and down at. What is Wang Lang doing?"</p>
<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>More than 10,000 yuan for a photo. Taking a photo seems like a very ordinary thing. It is not like painting or sculpture, which can get a higher price. Unexpectedly, recently there was a photo that got more than 10,000 silver dollars. This person is a young weaver in Manchester, England, named Charles Powell. He took a photo of his fiancée on a rock on the Isle of Man. It happened to be the opening of a large photography competition. He sent the photo in. Unexpectedly, the result was ranked first in Kodak's worldwide photography competition. He also got a portion of the prize money, one hundred pounds. The national competition prize was one thousand pounds, which is about 10,000 silver dollars, and an extra prize of a silver statue. It is said that this competition received about three million photos from all over the world. A total of forty-seven countries participated. Representatives from eight countries judged the results. The result was that Powell won the top prize. (See page 4 of today's newspaper's pictorial weekly [Cloud and Water Vague] photograph)</p>
<p>"Dare I complain about my fate? My bones have been tempered, my figure is stern. My eyes have seen the rise and fall, many tears of sorrow. A good friend suddenly comes, we play a game of chess. I read old books again, and re-grind my inkstone. I am used to lifting it up for leisurely chanting for five nights. I count the remaining watches and leap at the drum." Also, a rhyming couplet: "Official pavilions, plum blossoms, spring wine are beautiful. Heavenly steps, willows, dawn breeze are sparse." Also, "I still dance when I hear the rooster crowing for five nights. At one time, a butcher of dogs also flew heroically." Also, "Watching chess in Chang'an becomes a broken game. The nations vying for hegemony start a battlefield." Also, "It is not necessary to leave the mountain as a small grass after all. Why refuse to turn the country over to famous flowers." All are works of elegant and lofty talent. Reading them moves people and admires them. The spirit is immortal. Luzhen also has it.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Feng Yuxiang</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang, who has long resided in the countryside, given the urgency of national affairs, took a special train south to discuss plans to save the country with important figures in Beijing and Shanghai. On the day of his arrival in Shanghai, the public saw Feng wearing a short jacket and belt, carrying a cotton cloth coat, with the Gandhi-like demeanor of bringing a spinning wheel and leading a goat. Here are some anecdotes for conversation.</p>
<p>Feng lost his parents at a young age and was extremely poor. He could not support himself. At the end of the late Qing dynasty, each province established a standing army. Literary and military affairs were taught together. Feng joined the army and was valued by his superiors for his hard work and diligence. His position gradually rose because of this. In the Bingyin year, the Yu army invaded Shaanxi. The army defended the city firmly and held out for eight months. The Shaanxi army had no reinforcements, and their food and fodder gradually ran out. We in the city survived on wheat bran and oil residue. Later, even wheat bran and oil residue became precious items. People died one after another in Chang'an. Suddenly, one day, we heard very urgent cannon fire in the distance. The next morning, the siege of the city was lifted. People reported that Feng Yuxiang's army had come and had driven back the Yu army. His use of troops was so rapid. The tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians in the city were revived by Feng's strength.</p>
<p>When Feng was in charge of the Shaanxi government, the silk and satin decoration industries in Qin Province were extremely sluggish. This was because he promoted thrift and set an example by wearing cloth clothes and eating simple meals. Even banquets for guests consisted of no more than one or two dishes of meat. Wu Xintian, the division commander of the Shaanxi army, often said to people, "I would rather gamble and lose two hundred yuan than eat a meal with Feng Yuxiang." This saying became a laughingstock for a time.</p>
<h3>A Record of Painting Plums in the Daytime at the Mingqin Studio</h3>
<p>— Xiongcun</p>
<p>She Zisheng was skilled in the study of bronze and stone inscriptions. He went to Hunan and obtained a magnetic seal made by Ding Shejingshen, which bore the inscription "Mingqin". He named his studio after it to express his joy. In addition to seal carving, Shengming was also skilled in calligraphy and painting. He and Xiang Zhegong were known as the "Two Talents of Sichuan". Initially, he was quite proud of his iron brush. However, after seeing Zhegong, he sighed that he was a successor to Dun Ding, unparalleled in the world. He abandoned his profession and devoted himself to painting plums, eventually becoming a master of his generation. Zhang Daqian was a famous painter in the country. After seeing Shengming's plum blossoms, he was so beautiful and refined that he admired them with his hands clasped. He once said to people that Zhegong's seal carving was like Dun Ding, and Shengming's plum blossom painting was like Chao Lin. Shengming's plum blossom paintings were marked with Zhegong's seal, making them hard to compare. His admiration for the two was extreme. Shengming traveled to Jiashan and, through Zhegong's introduction, became acquainted with Daqian. All three were born in Sichuan, and all were addicted to painting. They shared the same interests and forgot to sleep while talking. Sometimes, when they were in the mood, Daqian would wield his brush and create ancient pines, twisting and turning. Zhegong would splash ink and paint bamboo, sending his eyes and hands, communicating with the spirit and exhausting the state. Shengming would add plum blossoms to complete the work. Often, more than a dozen sheets would be completed in one night without fatigue.</p>
<h3>Looking at Xiang Qi and Talking About [blank]</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zumo</p>
<p>After the fall of the Qing dynasty, many of the loyal ministers who went into seclusion regarded the foreign concession as a comfortable nest. Many traces of the old remained in Tianjin and Shanghai in the north and south. They gradually withered away during the twenty years of the Qing dynasty. Recently, Zhu Zumo was heard to have died. The model of the predecessor will not be seen again. Zumo's courtesy name was Guwei, also Ou Yin, and his style name was Jiangcun. His original name was Xiaozang, but he changed it to Zumo to avoid the temple taboo. He was from Wuxing, Zhejiang. In the Guiwei year, he passed the imperial examination with the first place in the second class and was awarded the title of compiler. His calligraphy was modeled after Yan Lugong. During the provincial examination, the son of the Minister of Revenue, Yan Jingming, also imitated Yan's calligraphy. The chief examiner wanted to curry favor with Yan and placed the examination paper at the top. When he opened the seal, he saw that it was Zumo's. Later, he was promoted from attendant bachelor to vice minister of the Ministry of Rites. He asked to return home due to illness while serving as the director of education in Guangdong. He lived in Suzhou and filled in lyrics with Zheng Shuwen (Zhuo) to pass the time. When Emperor Xuantong ascended the throne, he was appointed as an advisor to the Court of Ceremonies but did not take office. During the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year, Empress Dowager Cixi summoned officials to see her and ordered them to speak their minds. Zumo immediately said, "The Empress Dowager shields treacherous parties and relies on rioters to fight against foreign countries. What is her intention? Now that the crisis is imminent, who will she rely on?" The Empress Dowager said, "Dong Fuxiang knows military affairs and is good at fighting. He can be trusted." Fuxiang is昏庸, how can he be relied on?" The Empress Dowager said sternly, "Zumo speaks in a southern accent, and I do not understand him." After he withdrew, the Empress Dowager still glared at him. Everyone thought that he would be severely punished. Later, the Empress Dowager occasionally said to people that although Zumo had spoken out of line, his loyalty was commendable. In recent years, he lived in Shanghai. Lyricists regarded Zumo as the leader of lyrics in the contemporary era and formed the Ou Society, honoring him as the leader. One or two unworthy people were shaken by his reputation and asked to be included in the society. Although Zumo despised their character, he did not refuse them. The generosity and kindness of the elder cannot be matched. Five days before his death, he composed a lyric that was sad and desperate. It was his last work. He died at the age of seventy-five.</p>
<p>Shengming's enthusiasm was particularly high. He often painted several plum blossoms by himself and only stopped when he was satisfied. Pink and black marks were all there. White line drawings and ink halos were all extremely skillful. As the days went by, he created more and more works. From January 9th, he will hold an exhibition at the Jiashan Library for two days. If there are connoisseurs in the world, the style will change. The host of Kan Yun Lou told me that Zhu Guwei, the vice minister, once saw Shengming's ink plum blossoms and said that he could convey his aloof nature. He repeatedly urged him to exhibit his works. Shengming agreed with hesitation. Now that the exhibition is scheduled, the vice minister has suddenly passed away and cannot see it. I am sad. (Transfer rewards to help disaster relief)</p>
<h3>Going on Expedition</h3>
<p>— A Member of the Youth Support Cavalry</p>
<p>(10) Summary of the Beijing-Shanghai Section (Part 1)</p>
<p>We departed from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th and did not arrive in Nanjing until the afternoon of the 18th. During these eleven days, we traveled through all the major cities on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. What made us happy and encouraged was that the people everywhere had a determination to save the country. Especially the young students, who would rather endure hunger and cold and call out in all directions. This kind of painstaking effort is truly admirable and praiseworthy. It is only a pity that they waste this precious time.</p>
<p>Since our departure, we have been welcomed and sent off by compatriots everywhere. We have also received comfort, encouragement, flags, expenses, food, and so on. We feel deeply grateful and will wait to kill the enemy and atone for our sins in the future. The two places of Changzhou and Zhenjiang each sent us a broadsword. (Like the ones used by the Feng Army's broadsword team in the past) (Extremely sharp. When you take it out of its scabbard, the cold light shines on people. It can greatly increase the courage of the warriors.</p>
<p>When we marched from Shanghai to Kunshan for several days, the spirit of the entire team was still able to maintain its original state. What was even more commendable was that the female comrades were also very heroic and not tired at all. They still took big steps and bravely advanced. This is truly embarrassing for countless men.</p>
<p>We originally intended to walk to our destination. Later, the railway bureau sincerely advised us, saying that it was feared that it would arouse the patriotic fervor of the people along the way. We also hoped that the national fortune of ["internal peace and external resistance"] would succeed. Therefore, we accepted the kindness of the authorities and took the train from Kunshan onwards.</p>
<h3>A Few Words</h3>
<p>— Xiaoru</p>
<p>When a civil war breaks out, both sides do not give way and resist with all their strength.</p>
<p>Now Jinzhou has fallen. The power of the Japanese slaves is increasing day by day. They will advance on Shanhaiguan. Our eyes are fixed on the map of broken rivers and mountains changing color. The catastrophe of national subjugation is imminent. One by one, they are still pushing you and you are pushing him, arguing about private views, blaming each other, and failing to unite and quickly plan resistance. Where has the prestige of the past civil war gone? Some people say that ["being brave in private fights"] is an inherent bad trait of the Chinese people and cannot be eliminated. I say that those who have this bad trait are not the Chinese people. Because if they are truly Chinese, they know how to plan for their own China. (To be rewarded)</p>
<h3>The Story of Double Buildings Amidst War (5)</h3>
<p>— The Happy Master of Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter 1: An Unparalleled Courtesan Lives Alone, Yearning for Her Beautiful Companion. A Scholar Far From Home, Drifting and Forging a Strange Fate. He used a very sincere tone to bid her farewell, saying, "The dragon is not a thing of the pool. I am an unequal match for you. I don't resent you for betraying me and leaving, but I hope you will behave well in the future and find a happy ending. Don't go back to being a prostitute again, and don't be insecure and be tempted by someone. Don't follow some gigolo and destroy your most precious self. We met in a scene, and I still care about your future." After hearing these words, which were half sarcastic and half admonishing, she calmly replied, "Thank you for treating me so well. If I were not determined to be a good person, I would not be willing to separate from you. Now, please rest assured. I am not that kind of unmindful fool. I had already gotten rid of the evil pimp's bondage when I first married you. From then on, I am a free person again. There are so many things I can do. How can I jump into that fire pit again? As for those sweet-talking and impractical gigolos, I have never looked at them properly. I have this confidence in myself. This kind of person cannot deceive me. I plan to rely on my own strength to make a career in the world and solve my own life. I don't believe that women like us have no ability at all. We don't have to rely on marrying a man to eat and be supported by men. Even if I do choose a promising and capable lover in the future who I can entrust my life to, I will never completely rely on him to live. I won't let him put on the airs of a master to dominate me. I must make him rely on the strength I help and the strategies I preside over to achieve great development and earn a good position. We will coexist and prosper, work together, and he cannot live without me. He cannot disobey me, and I will always tie him to my skirt and hold him in my heart. He will never dare to bully me or betray me." After hearing this proud speech, the old guy stuck out his tongue and replied with a cold smile, as if believing and not believing, "I hope so. Wouldn't that be great? I'm just afraid that such a good man who is willing to obey you will not be easy to find." She then said, "Then I don't necessarily need to marry someone else. I'll do my own thing!" After saying this decisively, they smiled at each other and parted. After that, she rented another beautiful small house and moved all the things from the former small mansion over. She established herself independently. On the outside of the gate was a sign with her own surname. On a strip of red paper, the four big characters "Gusu Liang Residence" were written. Inside, everything for daily life was beautiful and comfortable. But in her heart, she was not satisfied with this. Now that she was full-fledged and could fly at will, she could not suppress her eager ambition. She was going to stride into this free world.</p>

<h3>Financial News: Gold Price Drops Six Liang and Four Qian</h3>

There were few transactions, with mixed buying and selling, and as a result, the price continued to fall by six liang and four qian. Only three liang were traded.

<h3>Securities and Bonds Suddenly Fell in the Afternoon Market</h3>
<p>Results Mostly Returned Several Yuan</p>
<p>February Futures Suddenly Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday (9th), the securities and bond market situation: in the spot market, except for the 9620 Customs, all others have opened. The turnover was not sluggish. February futures of the futures market have been opened for several days, but there have been no transactions. Yesterday, the entire morning market suddenly opened, but the turnover was not high, and there were still no transactions in the afternoon market. January futures fluctuated more significantly in price, and the market was slightly more active. As for the changes, at the beginning of the morning market, the bond market environment was as calm as before, and the market's sentiment was generally good because the conscription had been implemented through lottery, and the retail demand was not sluggish. Various bonds rose slightly compared to the previous day. In the second session, the market sentiment was slightly weaker, and prices turned tired, but the trend was still quite peaceful. In the afternoon session, there were rumors in the market, and large investors also sold off. As a result, market sentiment was depressed, buying was scarce, and selling became very active, with prices falling step by step. January futures of the 20 Customs fell by almost 4 yuan, and the rest also fell sharply. The drop in market prices re-opened the new record of the past. As a result, compared to the previous day, except for the whole 6 Customs tax consolidation and disarmament, the 96 and other futures only had a change of a few jiao, while the others fell by more than 1.5 yuan to 2 yuan. Only the current goods of the Yili Customs consolidation and disarmament emergency scrolls and other current goods were slightly larger by a few jiao. Looking at the bond market situation, it is still very chaotic. Although it fell sharply yesterday, its rebound will also be very strong. It depends on whether the government can work hard to stabilize the market and encourage investment. The total turnover of current goods for the whole day was 33,000 yuan, and the futures turnover was only over 1.9 million yuan in the morning market, and about 2.2 million yuan in the afternoon market, totaling 4.17 million yuan.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Once Rebounded Last Week</h3>
<p>But Market Sentiment Became Hesitant Again on the Weekend</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 8th reported on the cotton market for the week: At the beginning of last week, the cotton market was slightly sluggish due to short selling, but its supply was bought by colleagues and short covering. After the short selling stopped, it rebounded. The hoarding movement in the South also continued unabated, and the buying interest was also active. The reason is that the securities market situation turned positive, the European financial situation also showed good signs, and the parliament will soon pass economic improvements. However, market sentiment became suspicious again on the weekend, and most people were holding a wait-and-see attitude. The limited supply in the South and the delay of transportation ships due to rain were also reasons. Mr. Carl Wye, a local state government official, said that if cotton farmers realize the seriousness of the situation, they should resolutely implement acreage reduction. At the beginning of December last year, cotton farmers in central Texas convened a conference to request the governor, if satisfactory guarantees could not be obtained in other states, to reduce the cotton acreage to 50% of the lowest limit, then the cotton acreage reduction law should be repealed. However, the governor opposed it, saying that the farmers had sought this from the legislature, and that the cotton-growing states had not yet fallen into this situation.</p>

<h3>Grain Market in Hexia Turned Loose After Clear Weather</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources for various gangs in the southern part of Shanghai were about 40 or so due to the calm winds. Most of them were thin, and the amount of goods stored in the warehouses was limited. The stores in the urban and rural areas were sluggish. Due to financial reasons, buyers were holding on to bargain prices. Early and late rice each fell by 1 jiao. There were few sources of Changzhen white grain. The Ningbo gang's transactions became more and more inflexible. The top grade in this city moved slightly, and the situation was also half a jiao higher. Duyangjian and Bianyinyuan's sales were flat, but the stocks were dwindling, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>The transactions of various stores in Xinzha yesterday were still sluggish. The liquor from the west road was still abundant, and the stock in Hexia was quite thick. The rice stores were unwilling to add more, so the trend saw a decline. Changshu white, grass, and rice were each one foot shorter. Duyangjian's arrival and sales were generally flat, and the price fluctuated. The warehouse of Bianyuan was sluggish, without glory.</p>
<h3>Guest Yuan Sales Active and Stepped Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of foreign rice in this street were still good, but there were new arrivals in large quantities, and the market price turned lower. It is estimated that 3,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were opened, priced at 9 yuan, 7 jiao to 9 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 jiao. The only new transaction was Yuanxing's sale of 350 tons of Jiaodang in March, priced at 4 liang, 6 qian, 8 hao, 8 si and a half. Other transactions failed due to disagreement on prices. The return cargo opened 400 to 500 tons, all of which were Xiaotong rice, and the price was slightly weak. Although the arrival and stock of Kexian rice were small, so the outlook should be good, it was difficult to expand due to the impact of foreign arrivals. Yesterday, 100 bags of Taizhou rice were opened, priced at 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 8 jiao, which was also handled by this street. However, the Jiangxi Yuan rice was smoothly handled by the northern gang, and the stock in the market was gradually sold and less and less. The back road was cut off, and the market sentiment and prices were both expected to rise. Yesterday, the northern gang went to Jiangxi to get 500 bags of Kexian Yuan rice, priced at 14 yuan, followed by 13 yuan and a half. The highest prices had already run out of stock.</p>
<h3>Flour Suddenly Turned Lively in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Near and Far Each Good Two Eight Plus</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: after opening in the morning, the prices of each month showed a sluggish appearance, which was about 5 li lower than the closing price of the previous day. However, because there were very few sellers, the buyers were firm, and it was rapidly proved that most of them had been paid, and their strength seemed to be strong again, so the opening price was gradually stable. Until the opening of the afternoon market, it was still generally flat. Later, due to the deterioration of the Sino-Japanese relations, some nervous people faded away because they heard that the foreign goods were blocked, and small factories bought more. Therefore, the near and far terms suddenly showed a lively trend. As a result, this month was 1 fen and 7 li and a half higher than the previous day, February was 2 fen higher, March was 2 fen and a half higher, April and May were 2 fen and 2 li and a half higher, and June was 2 fen higher.</p>
<h3>Wheat Remains Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for wheat futures showed a flat and tired appearance in each month. As the end of the year is approaching, the long-term customers of the mainland gangs are gradually closing their positions. Moreover, the delivery of this month has to be brought forward a few days. The factories have foreign goods ready. There is no news of anyone intending to receive the goods in the exchange, so the market sentiment is still depressed, and the distant terms are also falling. As a result, this month fell by 3 fen compared to the previous day, February and March fell by 3 fen, April and May fell by 2 fen, and June was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Plate Slightly Declined and Xinqing Sugar Turned Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram: Cuban spot sugar is still 1.15625. New York sugar futures March 1.08 May 1.13 September 1.23 December 1.3, each fell by 1 and 2 fen compared to the previous telegram. Java spot and futures sugar still had no rise or fall. The atmosphere in the local market was slightly weak, so the plate transaction turned quiet, and the market saw a slight decline. Dutch refined 24 coarse sand white's buying interest was very scarce, and the asking price was 9 liang, 7 qian and a half, with almost no inquiries. Mianhe white was 11 liang, 6 qian. No. 20 medium sand white was 6 liang, 7 jiao, which still felt firm. No. 8 Dutch red was 8 liang, 4 jiao, and both entry and exit were sluggish. Taikoo sugar transactions also turned quiet, because the order was about to arrive. However, even at this time of shortage, the inventory was not willing to let go, so the Shaanxi price was still 12 liang, 4 jiao, the lower grade HX Shaanxi was 11 liang, 8 qian and a half, and HM Mark was 11 liang and a half, with slight transactions. Because there was no order, the market was still firm. The number plate had domestic Taiyuan water opening at 100 boxes, priced at 8 liang, 7 qian, Zu Shang water opening at 13 liang and a half, and Mianhu red opening at 11 liang, 3 jiao, with only 30 bags, and the trend was still stable. Xinqing sugar continued to arrive, but high-quality goods were very scarce, opening at 8 liang, 2 qian to 2 qian and a half, which seemed to have declined slightly compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Preserved Dates Sales Prices Turned Loose</h3>
<p>There have been continuous arrivals of preserved dates recently. It was found that there was still a lot of inventory in the market, so the market momentum was weak and lifeless. In addition, sales in various directions have not been smooth, and the spread price has been loosened again. Recently, the top grade Zhengong Tutu only sells for 23 to 24 liang, the middle grade Lanxi Tutu does not sell for more than 20 liang, and the remaining lower grade Tutu sells for 16 to 17 liang. Vendors are actively buying and selling them separately. It seems difficult for the market to rebound.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea White Filature Still Has No Transactions</h3>
<p>A-Grade French Filature Only Opened at 810 Liang</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no turnaround in the foreign silk market in this city. Yesterday, the city was rumored to be prosperous in Mabao Leon, and a small number of silk telegrams were transferred to Shanghai. Various manufacturers went to various French foreign firms to inquire about transactions. It was unexpected that the A-grade 13-15 denier white filature only opened at a price of 810 liang. The factory found that the loss was too great, so it was still difficult to sell. American sales were also still silent. There was no news of white filature transactions. Yesterday, only Da Chang entered 7 packages of Dong filature, and Zhonghe entered 10 packages of Baigan filature, and the price was still flat and tired.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Desolate State of Piece Goods, Both Chinese and Foreign</h3>
<p>The piece goods market has been in a state of collapse due to the dual pressures of foreign troubles and natural disasters. It has been almost a month since the market came to a halt. Although there has been some activity, it has been minimal. Recently, it has become even quieter. The end of the Western calendar year is approaching, and the general closing period at the end of January is just around the corner. Because of the sealed storage of Eastern goods this year, the industry is feeling difficulties. Therefore, the collapse of goods transactions can be said to be completely immobile. The issue of accounts receivable from other ports is earlier than in previous years, but it is feared that it will be difficult to be satisfied afterwards. The situation of Western goods has been quite stable recently. The inventory of bleached cloth is less than in previous years, and the asking price is quite firm. Taihe's Red Chicken is opened at 13 liang, 2 qian and a half, and the fair Red Little Deer is 12 liang, 8 qian and a half. There has been slight turnover in this street. The Sichuan and Changsha gangs also have an appetite. Poplin, the Changjiang gang, once had some activity, but because the previously ordered goods had been released and arrived, it is feared that it will be difficult to improve, so they have returned to a standstill. Factory yarn woven, foreign yarn plain yarn, etc. are completely immobile. The falling wind of coarse cloth of this factory has stopped. 11-pound are opened at 5 liang, and 9-pound are 4 liang, 7 qian and a half. Bound cloth gradually falls. Balloon is 7 liang, 4 qian, Siping Yun is 7 liang, 3 qian, and Shenxin Chicken is 7 liang, 2 qian, 2 fen and a half. Fashionable goods such as colored striped yarn and plain woven yarn are not plummeting, because the sales route is already limited. Manufacturers are shipping a lot, and the number of dyeing and weaving factories is increasing daily. Because Eastern goods cannot be sold now, and common Western goods are lacking, those in this industry are raising funds to set up factories and produce goods, mostly shoddy serge and straight tribute, in order to make up for the situation.</p>
<h3>Hardware Tinplate Sells Smoothly</h3>
<p>The tinplate transaction has seen considerable progress recently, such as the acceptance by the cigarette factory gang and the hoarding by the domestic gang, so there have been many transactions. It was found that the number of shipments in the past three days has reached 7,000 to 8,000 boxes. The market, which had been deserted for many days, suddenly presented an optimistic scene. Although the market situation has not risen, it is much better than before. At present, 110-pound thin iron is sold for 38 liang, 200-pound Huisi iron is 25 liang, 5 qian, 90-pound British iron is 10 liang, 100-pound is 13 liang, 90-pound American goods is 14 liang, 100-pound is 16 liang, and 180-pound is 22 liang.</p>
<h3>Small Forum</h3>
<p>Beware of Conspiracies to Sabotage the Patriotic Movement</p>
<p>Recently, a booklet has been discovered in this city, titled [The True Method of Saving the Nation]. It is said that this booklet is being distributed door-to-door in the dead of night.</p>
<p>The content of the booklet opposes the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. The so-called true method of saving the nation is to overthrow the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and reject its inspections. The five methods listed inside are: 1) report to the police and file a public lawsuit; 2) form associations of the same trade and of the same district; 3) petition the court to dissolve the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association; 4) petition the police to ban the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association; 5) petition the government to prohibit the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. This booklet is not signed and has no publishing location. It is clearly a poisonous hidden arrow and a malicious conspiracy.</p>
<p>I suspect that the distributors of this booklet are Japanese, because the boycott movement is a fatal blow to Japan, and Japan has repeatedly asked our government to ban it. At the same time, I also suspect that those engaged in this dirty business are traitorous merchants in this city, because the boycott movement has indeed caused many disadvantages to the traitorous merchants who rely on selling [Japanese</p>
<p>goods] to get rich. Regardless of whether it is done by the Japanese or by Chinese traitors, there is no doubt that the purpose of this booklet is to sabotage the boycott movement. If it is the Japanese who are engaging in these ghostly tricks, it will only further show their panic and cowardice, which is enough to increase our determination and resolve to boycott Japanese goods. If it is our own people who are engaging in this sabotage of the patriotic movement, then they are truly public enemies of the nation, traitors of the nation, and their crimes are unforgivable.</p>
<p>Our fellow businessmen should recognize that boycotting Japanese goods is our last remaining weapon for resisting violence and saving ourselves, and it is also the most practical and effective method. Before Japan ceases its aggression against us, this weapon must not be relaxed. We should recognize this conspiracy to sabotage the patriotic movement and be careful not to be deceived by this senseless nonsense that has lost its spirit. Only with a nation can there be a home; saving the home starts with saving the nation. Boycotting Japanese goods saves the nation, while selling Japanese goods at most only allows one's own family to earn some profit. Everyone should carefully recognize the importance of the matter.</p>

<h3>First Aid for Electric Shock Pillar Middle</h3>
<p>Once someone is shocked by electricity, is sucked by the electric wire and cannot break free, immediately notify the power plant to cut off the current. Before the current is cut off, never try to rescue! But if you know that the current; is direct current, voltage below 500 volts (commonly known as pounds) or alternating current 'voltage below 300 volts, you can very carefully rescue like this... Use a very dry wooden pole five or six feet long (the longer the better) and a very dry rope two fathoms long, pull the shocked person off the electric wire. If the electric wire sucks the shocked person too tightly, you can only cut the electric wire with an axe, but the handle of this axe must be very dry wood and more than five feet long, and you must wrap your hands well with very thick, dry cloth (preferably wool or silk)! Cut off the wires on both sides of the shocked person at the same time!</p>
<p>After rescuing the shocked person, if he already appears dead, do not think that he cannot be saved! Immediately send him to a place with ventilation, and try to restore his breathing. Pull his tongue once, or use other artificial respiration methods; at the same time, restore his blood circulation, pat his torso with your palms or a hot towel, sprinkle cold water on his face one after another, and finally make him smell ammonia water, and he can be revived.</p>
<p>Within the possible range, it is always advisable to call a doctor as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Sister-in-law in the Garret</p>
<p>People who have not lived in Shanghai' seem not to feel the wonderfulness of [titles]. Common titles for men are mostly Mr. Common titles for women are mostly Mrs., Grandma, Miss, or Good Woman, Sister-in-law. These titles are generally about the same everywhere. What about Shanghai? The titles for women must be given a special title. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four major elements of life. And among the four elements, in Shanghai, the word [housing] is the most difficult. It goes without saying for the class of people who sit in cars and live in foreign houses: an ordinary building often houses four or five families. Garret family, main hall family, side building family. Then the problem of titles arises. If you call someone "Sister-in-law," people will definitely not understand who you're referring to… Sister-in-law upstairs in the main hall? Or Sister-in-law in the garret?</p>
<p>In this way, in addition to the common "Sister-in-law," "Good Woman," and "Grandma," special nouns must be prefixed. So there are "Sister-in-law in the garret," "Good Woman upstairs in the main hall," "Grandma in the side building," "Elder Sister in the room next door…" titles.</p>
<p>If ladies, grandmas, and misses who sit in cars and live in foreign houses hear these titles, they must say, "Ah! How strange!"</p>

<h3>Vegetarian and Meat Dishes</h3>
<p>K Jun created the idea, Dirt Buddha Runwen</p>
<p>Psychological Vegetarian—Psychological Meat</p>
<p>Fish, meat, shrimp, crab… are meat dishes. Vegetables, greens, melons, beans… are vegetarian dishes. Everyone knows this.</p>
<p>But in ancient monasteries, there were eminent monks and virtuous elders who, though nominally monks, actually ate meat. As far as I know, there are many such cases. Probably these eminent monks have a thorough understanding of the principles of Taoism: the mind is the Buddha, so what harm is there in eating meat? Form is emptiness, so why bother with vegetarianism? The ancients said, [There is a prostitute in the eye, but no prostitute in the heart,] that is what these people are like. Someone gave Master Dexin forty chicken eggs, and the Master swallowed them all. Many people laughed at him, and the Master composed a verse:</p>
<p>[A mouthful contains the chaotic universe, there is neither skin nor blood nor hair. This old monk will take you to the Western Paradise, so you can avoid being</p>
<p>killed in the world.]</p>
<p>They have their own explanations for eating meat. I can't do anything with these people, I call them psychological vegetarians. There are already quite a few vegetarian restaurants open in Shanghai, and their business is also very prosperous. But what I don't understand is, since it is a vegetarian restaurant, it is naturally completely vegetarian. Excellent turnips should be fried as turnips, and braised tofu should be braised as tofu, but they insist on adding the names of meat dishes, such as</p>
<p>vegetarian chicken, vegetarian duck, vegetarian fish, vegetarian meat... Why bother?</p>
<p>Probably a few old adventurers who opened restaurants are good at guessing the psychology of society. Because now there are a few gentlemen who eat vegetarian food, but they are not sincerely eating vegetarian food, but are eating vegetarian food as a fad. I also eat vegetarian food, but eating vegetarian food is not comfortable or enjoyable. So the old adventurers who opened vegetarian restaurants use a method of [quenching thirst with plums] [satisfying hunger with painted cakes], making the name meaty but the substance vegetarian. Sure enough! It is greatly welcomed by the general public of vegetarian eaters! I call these people psychological carnivores. I have a friend who also used to eat vegetarian food, but he doesn't eat meat, but he eats the by-products cooked in meat. He doesn't eat fish, but he eats the by-products cooked in fish. The same goes for chicken, duck, and other things. This is another innovation in eating vegetarian food. I once laughed at him and said, [You</p>
<p>are truly a</p>
<p>dropout among meat eaters,</p>
<p>a revolutionary among vegetarians,</p>
<p>you can be regarded as a bat in the eating world!]</p>
<h3>Special Translation of the Christmas of the White Russians in This City</h3>
<p>The calendar used by the Orthodox Church is about two weeks different from the calendar used by the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church. The seventh day is the Orthodox Christmas, which is a big festival for the Slavs. The White Russians in this city all have banquets and celebrations.</p>
<p>On the eve of Christmas, Russian men and women go to church to pray and perform the Mass. After that, they hold lit candles and return home at dawn. This scene could still be seen in the French Concession yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Russian families also set up Christmas trees, and children often boast about their rich decorations to their peers. On Christmas Day, groups of children receive sweets from Santa Claus under the tree. Also, on Christmas Eve, when friends gather and a large banquet is opened, a bundle of dry grass is often placed under the tablecloth, so that guests do not forget the items in the cradle where Jesus was born.</p>
<p>Their recipes are also very special, with only fish, vegetables, and mutton stew. Although there is a plate of rich roast goose next to it, guests who have a gluttonous taste, even if they are drooling, can only look at it and dare not taste it. Slavs regard this as a delicacy for tomorrow and are not allowed to eat it. In addition, on the morning of Christmas, children go to relatives to congratulate them, and there is also a custom of receiving sweets and money, which is similar to the old custom of pressing down the year in our country. Shanghai Story</p>
<h3>Shanghai Story (3)</h3>
<p>The First Cannon Outside Wusongkou</p>
<p>In his report [The Voyage of the Amherst to the Northern Ports of China], Lindeus highly praised Shanghai as an excellent commercial entry point, but the East India Company dismissed it. At that time, the British decided to use the Zhoushan Islands as the center of British trade with China. The importance of Shanghai had not yet been felt.</p>
<p>Since the Opium War began in the twentieth year of Daoguang, the first cannon outside Wusongkou awakened the sleeping land, and Shanghai's new fate began to descend. Whether this new fate is a blessing or a curse, we cannot determine now. But just for Shanghai, the unprecedented sound of British warships broke its poor and unbearable fate and embarked on a new path of prosperity and wealth, which is not Shanghai's blessing. But [fortune never comes twice, misfortune never comes alone]. Since then, Shanghai has become a blessed den of demons in the Far East.</p>
<p>In the twenty-second year of Daoguang (1842 AD), British generals William Parker and Bird Gu led an army of 4,000 men, attacked and captured Xiamen, Ningbo, and Zhapu successively, and arrived directly at Wusongkou on June 13.</p>
<h3>A Bloody Battle</h3>
<p>The Shanghai officials had no prior preparations for coastal defense. Once they discovered that the British army was about to attack Shanghai, they made every effort to defend themselves in a hurry, repaired the forts on both sides of Wusongkou, and built earthen embankments along the Yangtze River, from Wusong to Baoshan County, a length of three English miles. They collected earthen cannons, bird guns, and short guns to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>In addition to the garrison soldiers, they also temporarily recruited village braves. At that time, there were 3,000 soldiers from Xuzhou, Henan, and Jiangning, and 800 rattan shield soldiers, but they had not been trained for a long time and their military equipment was not sufficient. The weakness of the military force is self-evident. The most interesting thing was the invention of waterwheels tied to both sides of sand boats, using human power to move the wheels and stir the waves, which could travel three English miles per hour.</p>
<p>The British fleet proceeded very slowly due to unfamiliar waterways. On the dawn of June 16, the British used steamships to tow warships forward, approaching our army, only about 500 yards apart. At this time, our army fired all cannons, piercing three British warships, killing three people and injuring several others. In the end, due to the imprecision of the weapons, our country was defeated. The British soldiers then landed and went straight to Baoshan. Our army retreated to Suzhou. In this bloody battle, the military and civilians of Shanghai and the officials bravely resisted. As a result, more than 200 people died and countless were injured.</p>
<h3>The Fall of Shanghai</h3>
<p>British warships sailed into the Suzhou River and arrived at Xinzha Bridge. The army landed and occupied the county seat. There were very few soldiers in the city. After a little resistance, they immediately withdrew. The order in the city was in chaos, and the people fled the city one after another. The gangsters took the opportunity to rob and loot. The British army also searched and plundered, leaving nine out of ten houses empty, which was the first great robbery in Shanghai in nearly a hundred years.</p>
<p>After the British army occupied Shanghai, they sent people to measure the water volume in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River. British General Parker and others also went to Songjiang to observe the situation. A week later, the British warships left Shanghai and sailed to Nanjing on June 23.</p>
