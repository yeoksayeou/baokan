<h3 id="c1">畢卡教授之高空探險 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>吾嘗聞科學救國之説矣。謂中國欲圖自强。非努力研究科學不可。此言誠然。吾又嘗聞航空救國之説矣。謂中國欲禦外侮。非擴充空軍實力不可。此言亦誠然。然而吾徒聞其言。而未見其行也</p>
<p>吾國人愛空憩。崇高論。有所思。即出之於口。筆之於文。而能事己畢。如何實行。非所計也。對於學問然。對任何事亦莫不皆然。西人則否。事有未解。加以思考。思有所得。進而實騐。成功。始行著述而公諸世間。其崇尚實騐冒險進取之精神。有爲吾人所莫及者。如此畢卡教授之高空探險。其一例也畢卡教授於十八日晨五時五分。乘其自製之氣球。由沮利克之飛行塲上昇高空。作同温層之第二次測騐。聞其主要目的。在繼續研究所謂［宇宙線。］及校去年五月第一次上昇時所得之各種紀録。氣球上昇高度。據其自發之無線電報告。己逾十英哩。超過以前汽球或飛機之有人駕駛者所逹高度</p>
<p>之紀録。</p>
<p>畢卡教授之高空探險。發起於一九三○年是年九月。畢卡與其助手即擬乘氣球上昇。但因設備未周。臨時氣球不能昇起。遂致失敗。去年五月乃作第二次之試騐。其時氣球上昇高度。亦曾逹十英哩。但忽遇反旋風被迫下降。飄盪空中。歷十八小時。故此次高空探險。若並一九三○年一次計算。蓋己爲第三次矣。</p>
<p>高空探險非輕易之工作。上昇愈高。則空乘愈稀。呼吸愈感困難。故必携有酸素吸入器。同時温度低下。寒冷殊甚。且照畢卡去年一次探險時之經騐其所乘鋁室外部温度雖在攝氏零下五十度。而室璧因受日光直射之故。竟致灼手。室内反覺蒸暑。使人燥渴難耐。其困苦情形。既可想見。而意外之危險。尤非事前所能防範也。</p>
<p>畢卡教授何爲而作此高空探險乎。其欲測之宇宙缐。究爲何物。此舉於科學界及航空界將有若何之貢獻。在此短小之篇幅中。苦未能一一詳述。且亦無詳述之必要。吾人所當知者。乃畢卡教授爲謀科學界之進步發見。換言之。爲忠於學問而作此冒險之舉動而己。至其成功與否。原非吾人所能豫料。即畢卡教授自身。恐亦未有把握也。</p>
<p>畢卡教授爲謀科學之進步而作高空探險。故各國學者均加以甚大之注。意。予以有力之贊助。報紙上既滿載其消息。飛行家氣象台又爲之攝影通信。以此又可知西人崇尚科學之熱烈。有非吾人所可企及者。</p>
<p>科學研究。非空言所能收益。救國方策。非空言所能獲效。必有人焉。起而研究。進而實行。又有大多數人爲之後援。始克有偉大之成就。今國人則不然。此或即中國所以科學落後。國危民困之大原因歟。是以今後。不言救國。不談提倡科學則己。否則。畢卡教授忠於其事。不問收穫。但事耕耘之精神與美德。實吾人所最宜模傚而發揮者也。</p>

<p>捧了金飯碗討飯吃</p>
<p>十三日下午四時、楊虎城氏宴我們全體國員於省政府、因和中國科學社年會開幕的時間衝突、所以直至下午五時後我們才絡繹前往、省政府在全城的中央、本爲昔時帝王禁城遺址、故面積甚寛大、行行重行行、入門後步行數分鐘、才到了宴會所在的大禮堂、該堂傅係馮煥章氏所築、美奂美輪、十分神氣、可知馮雖節衣縮食、而對於中外觀瞻所繫的省府、却也不惜工程、很是注意、那時我們以時間尚早、相與至堂後城堞上登高遠眺、馮弔古人遺跡、念滄海之桑田、不覺爲之唏嘘不己、</p>
<p>六時有人在低處鼓掌、招手示意、令我們下堞就席、我們便彼此魚貫而下、至大禮堂階前合歷、影、攝影後我們就依照席中所排定的地位入席席設三長桌、成平行線、中爲主席楊虎城氏陸、樂聲起後、建設廳長趙守鈺氏、以楊體氣不適、代表致歡迎辭、趙氏略謂［：以前到陜西的人、很是不少、不過他們挾着大兵、魚肉民衆、是侵略陜西的、這次考察團員、犧牲都市的榮華、而到物質十分落後的陜西、是開發陜西的、是爲陜西的民衆、開闢一新生命道路的、陜西連年荒旱、遍嘗着人間罕有的痛苦、雖然有了豐富的寳藏、却免不了餓莩載道、他們因爲缺乏科學和教育、貨棄於地、不知採拾、結果陜西的民衆、好像手中捧了金碗銀箸、還向着人們討飯、眞是可憐：］趙氏美辭令姿勢聲調又都很好、這一席話、博得全塲來賓一致鼓掌、來賓方面致答詞的、有隴海路局長錢宗湧和胡庶華等、當時楊王席穿着藍色的縐紗長衫、儀態温雅、除了他的奕奕有神的雙目外、看不出他是一個軍人、</p>
<h3 id="c79">鴨貴鷄賤的西安 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>十四日、我們往各處調查西安物價、有數種物價之貴、眞出我們意外、譬如烤鴨每只六元、廣生行牌菓子露每瓶一元四角、魚每斤三元半、汽水每瓶八角、汽油每箱十元、皮酒每瓶一元八角、都是令我們聞而咋舌、鷄價則很便宜、每元可買肥鷄四五只、鷄蛋每元可買一百二十餘枚、山西絲煤每一百斤約洋二元六角、每噸幾逹四十四元左右、實爲全世界最高的煤價、據云礦區之煤、每元可購二百斤無如由水道沿黃河載運至潼關、復由潼關轉運至渭南、再由渭南裝運至西安、一經加上運費、煤價便爾增高、以渭南至西安間之運費論、每煤一百斤、己需運費八角、其他可想而知、此外燿州之煤、每百斤約洋二元八角、燿州在陜北、與西安相去並不遥遠、其運煤也以車、大車一套者、（一馬一車者謂之一套、餘</p>
<p>類推）可載煤八百斤至九百斤、二套者約一千五百斤、三套者約二千斤、四套者約二千五百斤、運費約百斤需洋一元一角左右、至韓城之煤、因質性不佳、銷數不多、</p>
<p>由上可知、魚鴨之貴、由於水道缺乏、煤價之昻由於交通不便、從大體方面言之假使陜西的水道和交通問題、一日不解决、那末全省的實業、將永無發展的希望、所以隴海路綫如能延長至西安、無形中給陜西民衆一種生命之路、西北的開發、也加上了一種稳定的保障、我們更和雜糧商人談話、得各項物價結果如後、</p>
<p>小麥每担二十二元（每担二百五六十斤）</p>
<p>大麥每擔二十六元（每担二百六十斤）</p>
<p>小米每担十五元（每担二百六十斤）</p>
<p>黃荳每担十三元（每担二百四十斤）</p>
<p>大麥每担七元（每担一百六十斤）</p>
<p>芝蔴每担二十元（每担二百二十斤）</p>
<p>菜油每斤四角</p>
<p>麫粉每担二十五元（每担二百六十斤）</p>
<p>玉米每担十元（每担二百三十斤）</p>
<p>喬麥每担十元（每担二百二十斤）</p>
<p>緑荳每担十四元（的每担二百三十斤）</p>
<p>菜子每担三十元（第每担二百二十斤）</p>
<p>高梁每担五元（每担一百四二五十斤）</p>
<p>每担十三元（每担二百二三十斤）</p>
<p>至各種雜糧的産量與銷量、因向無統計無徒詢問、金融方面、祇有陜西省銀行·中交等行、在西安尚無設立分行的計劃、此外因爲我們没有充分的時間、預備回來時再行調查、</p>
<p>著名的延長石油、自民國十五年起己不銷至西安、其故因産量稀少、只可供附近各地之用、未有餘量以入西安、其實即使延長之油可運銷至西安、而延西相距約七百五十里、以一人一驢、走十二天計算、每油一箱、也需運費五元左右、再加上成本每桶約五元、其賣價未必能和美孚油相抵抗、關於本問題、己另有專家從事調查、一俟至延長實行視察後、再爲報告、（待續）</p>

<p>明日下午一時將召開緊急會議時聞社云、駐外領事簽發證貨單辦法、自經海關監督唐海安税務司克逹德·於昨日會銜佈告、定於下月一日起開始實行後、本埠日商業團體、己定於明日下午一時、在蓬路居留民團内、召開緊急會議、討論反對方針、一面並進行聯絡在滬各國商人一致對我、其告友邦僑商書、亦己於於日脱稿、一待明日緊急會議席上、加以文字上之修改後、即可發出、兹將各項消息、分誌於后</p>
<p>召開緊急會議日商此項緊急會議之舉行、由各路商聯會負責召集、並經定於明日下午一時、假座蓬路居留民團會議、室内舉行、其主要議案、即爲反對我海關當局昨日所公布之駐外領事簽發證貨單辦法、除由各路商聯會决定要求該國政府迅向我外交當局提出抗議外、並將廣徵日商意見、以資參考、至於其他討論事件、尚有［制止血魂除奸團等之活動、業經村井總領、向上海市府面提抗議、倘市府答復拒絶、將採何項辦法以應付之、］及［對華劉易、］日趨慘落、究應如何補救之、］等重要事項多起、</p>
<p>進行聯絡外商各國對華贸易、矣·英·美·日·德·各國、均同處於超等地位、日商因鑒於駐外領事簽發證貨單辦法、自經我方公布後、各國旅滬商人、並無反對之有示、今若獨持異議、决難收成效、故在滬各日商業團體、連日進行聯絡各國商人、希冀一致謀我、甚爲積極、惟日來進行結果、各國商人大都均抱觀望態度、不願與日商合作、以破壞雙方在國際贸易上之友誼、但日商方面、仍不絲毫覺悟、昨仍派出代表多人、分赴各國駐滬商業機關、進行其拉攏手段、以遂其聯絡一致恊謀反對之目的云、</p>
<p>告友邦僑商書旅滬日商除推派代表進行聯絡各外商外、並人發告友邦僑商書、其全文昨己擬就脱稿、洋洋千言、極盡挑撥離間之能事、惟全文尚須經明日緊急會議席上加以文字上之修改後、方可正式發表、惟其全文内容、據記者探悉、約可分爲、（一）駐外領事簽發證貨單辦法、一經實施後、各國對華贸易、將受重大打擊、（二）中國政府、爲求進行暗中排斥外貨計劃起見、故特實施駐外領事簽發證貨單辦法、（三）對華贸易有關係之各友邦商人、如對於中國政府此次實施之駐外領事簽發證貨單辦法、而不加以反對、則無異於自絶對華贸易生路等數項荒謬言論、即持其爲反對之理由云、</p>
<p>日商反對原由日本對外贸易、自去歲九一八事變發生後、因受我國抵貨運動影響、己一落千丈、加以血魂鋤奸之活動、及市商會通電各業、拒進日貨原料、更予日商以一致命傷、日商雖極力設法儘最減低各貨成本、營業仍毫無起色、際此對華贸易極端恐慌之際、而我國又擬定外領簽發貨單辦法十四條、定期施行、致日商運貨來華時、又將加重百元繳納八元領證費之負擔、則各貨成本勢必隨之增加、際此對華贸易、日趨慘落之時、虧折將益見鉅大、故日商對於昨日我海關公布財部擬定之外領簽發證貨單辦法、必加以堅决之反對也、</p>

<p>關於日兵越界示威、市府提出嚴重抗議各節、己屢誌報端、惟昨日報載日副領事所稱、日兵因交代換防而在中山路通過、係獲有諒解之根據云云、市政府秘書長俞鴻鈞、昨日發表談話云、當五月二十三日、日軍由閘北撤退時、豐田紗廠及同文書院、尚各留有日兵二十五名、其時日方移交委員與我方接收委員接洽、在日兵在豐田紗廠及同文書院暫駐時期、日軍因換防及供給食糧、得暫假道中山路、以逹各該地點、厥後共同委員會日代表曾報告該會主席、轉知我方代表、我方代表據報後、當以日本軍隊係分期撤退、在豐田紗廠同文書院之日兵、一時未及撤退期中、此種諒解、尚爲事實所需要、故未</p>
<p>表示反對、惟會向共同委員會聲明、此種辦法、一俟日本依照恊定將豐田紗廠同文書院之駐兵撤回、則應停止、故當時之諒解、係一種臨時辦法、現在同文書院之日軍、因早己撤退、而豐田紗廠方面日軍、又無留駐之理由、迭經我方代表嚴厲交涉、而日本副領事之藉口、實屬勉强附會之、</p>

<p>去年之中國海外贸易</p>
<p>海外贸易、關係重大、國力民情、於以具瞻、論政治經濟國家社會者、所不可忽也、我國向形入超、國人競言提提倡國貨、以爲國家根本之計、然政府未有具體之計畫、人民未有團結之組織、競尚空言、復何所補、今試一檢海外贸易之統計數字一觀之、有不驚心觸目、急圖孟晋者乎、海外贸易、必經海關、故海外贸易之眞相、亦以海關之統計爲可徵信、本報特就訊海關檢閲報告、節其尤重要者、分著於篇、俾國人有以惕厲焉、</p>
<p>民國二十年對外之總贸易、以值計之、合爲開平銀二十三萬萬四千三百萬、分計之、則進口值十四萬萬三千四百萬、出口值九萬萬零九百萬、相差入超五萬萬二千五百萬、以視民國十九年進口十三萬萬一千萬、出口八萬萬九千五百萬、相差入超四萬萬一千五百萬者、民國十八年進口十二萬萬六千六百萬、出口十萬萬零一千五百萬、相差入超一萬萬五千一百萬者、尤有過之、至以美金合計、則以金價步漲之故、民國十八年進口值八萬萬一千萬美金、民國十九年、進口值六萬萬零三百萬美金者、二十年僅值四萬萬八千八百萬美金而己、</p>
<p>再就進出口分别言之、（以千兩爲單位）二十年進口最多者、美國計關平三萬萬二千萬零二十六萬六千兩、其次日本二萬萬九千萬零三十八萬六千兩、再其次香港二萬萬一千八百十七萬兩、再其次、英國一萬萬一千九百三十四萬四千兩、以視十九年、美國計多進口九千八百六十一萬三千兩、日本計少進口三千一百九十一萬七千兩、香港多進口六百七十四萬七千兩、英國計多進口一千二百二十二萬六千兩、</p>
<p>出口最多者二十年、第一日本、值關平二萬萬六千四百九十五萬六千兩、其次香港一萬萬四千八百三十一萬二千、兩其次美國、一萬萬二千零二十萬零五千兩、其次英國、六千四百五十二萬六千兩、以視十九年、對日本計多出口四千八百四十萬萬一千兩、對香港計少出口九百七十萬零六千兩、對美國計少出口一千一百六十七萬五千兩、對英國計多出口一百八十五萬七千兩、</p>
<p>至中國海外贸易、遍於全球、固不僅上列之四處、其但列舉四處者、則以進出口之數量、計值最鉅也、若論出超入超、則民國廿年對外出超者、凡暹羅十六萬八千兩、南洋羣島七百五十二萬六千兩、波斯埃及等二千一百二十萬零八千兩、丹麥二百三十一萬一千兩、荷蘭三千六百零三萬五千兩、法國一千二百六十九萬一千兩、蘇俄三千零零九萬二千兩、高麗一九萬五千兩、對外人超者、凡美國二萬萬零零零六萬一千兩、日本二千五百四十三萬兩、香港六千九百八十五萬八千兩、澳門八十八萬八千兩、安南八百九十七萬兩、荷屬南洋羣島四千一百二十一萬四千兩、印度六千六百八十七萬一千兩、英國五千四百八十一萬八千兩、挪威一百四十九萬兩、瑞典四百零七萬六千兩、德國六千零零三十萬兩、比利時二千六百十八萬五千兩、瑞士四百十二萬四千兩、意大利一千零六十三萬七千兩、加拿大一千八百八十三萬六千兩、古巴四十二萬六千兩、南澳洲五千九百五十四萬四千兩、其他各國、四百五十四萬三千兩、合計共五萬萬二千四百零一萬三千兩、（前表以百萬爲單位、故值五萬萬二千五百萬）</p>
<p>總之、中國之海外贸易、以美英日爲前三位、測以二十年之情况、日本以受抵制而進口少衰、紗布糖煤海産之屬均受打擊、印度以少進口八百萬斤之米而跌落、至第四位、德國則毛織品及化學工業品鋼鐵紙張、均趨大盛、美國則以農産過賸、棉麥之屬出口遽增、外此烟葉木材汽油之屬、爲數亦多、南澳亦以麥之進口爲主要焉、</p>
<p>以云大宗出口、厥惟生絲、行銷日美英法印度等處、二十年之數量、銷日本者三萬二千七百十九擔、請美國者二萬九千七百四十一擔、銷法國者一萬八千八百零五擔、銷印度者九千五百二十五擔、茶之銷路、則大宗爲俄國、計二十四萬零八百廿四擔、而埃及土耳其之屬、亦銷至十六萬二千三百九十二擔外、此英美爲數不多矣、大豆行銷俄日荷蘭英國等處、計销俄國一千五百萬擔、日本一千一百萬擔、荷蘭六百萬擔、英國三百萬擔、民國二十年之進口贸易情形、與往年更有變動、未易殫述、蓋以銀價之狂跌、匯</p>
<p>兌率之不稳、國人講買力之退减、日貨之抵制、進口税之增加、各國生産過賸、而世界之需要减少、因多競銷中國、以致物價跌落、而中國之出口貨、亦以進出口相抵相銷之原理、因而同跌、雖二十年中、出口貨較形增加、然進口者乃視二十年又增一萬二千四百萬矣、</p>
<p>二十年進出口之盛於十九年者、大抵爲金貴銀賤之關係、故進口之以美金計算者、如上所述、實較十九年幾少至二萬萬之鉅、而進口之大宗、又多爲國外過賸之産物焉、兹以三年來大宗進口貨品之統計、列詳於左、</p>
<p>十八年十九年二十年</p>
<p>(關平千兩爲單位)</p>
<p>棉花九一·一二四一三二·二六六一七九·0八二</p>
<p>棉織物一八八·五七四一四九·八三九一二一·0七八</p>
<p>麥一二·四二一一二·八三一八七·六三九</p>

<p>麫粉六四·00八三一·九二六三0·九二0</p>
<p>由上言之、三年以來、進口互有增減、機器機油之屬、國産所未備、固無閒言、然而棉花麥子木材等、以吾國號稱農國者、乃亦盡多進口、外此、化學品顔料糖類、國人未嘗不有研精潛思、設廠製造者、然而準以三年以來之比較、亦因金價之昻、進口價值、相形上漲、足徴國貨之成效、尚復有限、夫以中國今日之困窮、天災人禍之不絶、然每年出超四五萬萬、數十年來、其數量之鉅、可以概見、國人誠不有勝其担負之勢、亦未有不因積累而致破産者、處兹外患日亟、努务圖存之際、讀者觀此寥寥數行之統計、宜如何奮發、以謀挽救、斯不能不厚責於國人矣、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>二一枝譚</p>
<p>[P東廂記和黑馬將軍</p>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>看了我那天做的一篇張生哭，便引起了友人的討論：</p>
<p>你説的東廂記中張生哭，倒也發噱</p>
<p>不見得吧，我是仿着亂説西游記的體例，在這裏亂説東廂記。</p>
<p>西廂記中的主角，是張生：東廂記中的主解，也是張生：固然是很巧的了。西廂記中張生的畏友，是白馬將軍：東廂記中張生的畏友，是黑馬將軍：這又是個絶妙的比例你爲什麽没有提起？</p>
<p>不錯，不錯，白馬將軍和黑馬將軍，都是張生的畏友，都是頂天立地的哥男子，固然可以比例一下子。不過，白馬將軍是援救張生的，黑馬將軍是待援於張生的：白馬將軍援救張生，曾把張生救出重圍：黑馬將軍待援於張生，張生欲不能把黑馬將軍救出重圍。照這麽説，西廂記中的白馬將軍，没有辜負了張生：東廂記中的張生，卻有些對不起黑馬將軍。事實上有這許多不同之點，所以，我在寫這篇張生哭，卻没有提起他們的畏友白馬將軍和黑馬將軍。</p>
<p>你看白馬將軍和黑馬將軍的處境，孰難敦易？</p>
<p>當然是白馬易，黑馬難了：孫飛虎易平，矮脚虎難除。不過，因難見巧，或者矮脚虎便失風在黑馬將軍手下，也未可知：我們快拭着眼瞧吧。</p>
<h3 id="c185">德國的怪傑希特勒 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 馬峻操</p>
<p>我這裏所要談的。便是德國棒喝團的領袖。法蒂斯主義的信徒。國家社會黨的黨魁。舉世側目的現代怪傑希特勒氏AdolfHitlero</p>
<p>當一九二三年的初冬。希氏得了魯登道夫將軍Gen·E·Ludendorff（歐戰時德軍的參謀總長）的臂助。贸贸然在門占Munchen揭竿作亂。宣布革命。不上一天便給當地的駐軍平定。希氏也不免琅璫入獄。嘗了一年的鐵窗風味。那時全歐洲的男女。都把這件流産的革命。當作談笑的資料。希氏所受到的祇是訕笑唾駡。但是一時的成敗利鈍。是不是重視的。你看。今日之下的希時勒氏又不是如何。</p>
<p>國家社會黨的成立。完全是希氏一個人的毅力所致。它雖有長久的歷史。但是現在却己成爲德國的最有勢力的政黨了。在一九二四年。該黨在議院中。只占有十二個議席。可是在一九二八年。便一躍而爲一○七席。今年的大選舉。照一般人的預測。大约可以增到二百三十席左右。國家社會黨勢力澎漲的所以如此神速。一方面由於黨魁希氏傑出的演説天才和辦黨毅力。一方面於德國社會狀况普遍的不安。丨工業的衰落。賠欵的負擔。失業的嚴重。</p>
<p>希氏於一八八九年生在奥地利的能得鎭Ｇnnundo他的父親是一個鐵路僱員希氏在年輕的時候。曾到南非洲參加英荷的保候戰争ＢorrsWaro到了二十三歲。他才到德國的門占。做了幾年的刷屋匠。一點也没有什麽發展。歐洲大戰爆發時。他就加入德軍。接連過了四年戰壕生活。歐戰過了。他就開始他的政治活動。在各處啤酒店咖啡館裏向飲衆演説。批評政府的政績。發表他個人的政見。他憑籍了他演説的天才。引起不少人的注意和興奮。</p>
<p>希氏具有瘦削的中等身材。鼻梁挺直。</p>
<p>髮黑觀高。嘴上留一撮小鬍子。雙目炯炯有神。他所標榜的政策。對外廢棄巴黎和約。取消歐戰賠欵。對内設立獨裁政治。滅盡猶太人一切的潛勢力。他理想中的至上人物。便是意相慕沙里尼。慕氏的照片放在他的寫字檯上。他模仿莫氏的任何舉動。甚至於連慕氏的舉手致敬禮。也是照樣模仿。他時常向新聞記者説。如果天賜給德國一個慕沙里尼。德國人是會跪下來崇拜他的。</p>
<p>最近希氏在柏林郊外演説。［過去十三年中。常使德人處桎梏之中。今後之國家社會黨將廓清不能有明白而强有力政策之三十餘政黨。並力求一能表現國家社會黨政策與能力之機會。：：：］你看他胸中的抱負。是怎樣的偉大。</p>

<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>昨天有四個穿着黑綢短衫褲的人，手裏拿着一本賬簿式的簿子。滿面笑容的闖進門來，也不知道對誰説。大聲嚷着：［今年上海給東洋人胡閙了一陣，閘北死了那麽許多人，更加天氣比往年熱，所以瘟疫就癘害了。］話没有説完，便把簿子放在我面前。我看上面有人寫一元，有人寫二元，甚至五元，十元都有。我很奇怪。這不是寫捐麽？上海時疫醫院大半全是慈善機關設的，從來没有聽見寫過捐：這是怎麽一回事呢？我心裏想着，便以孤擬的眼光注視着他們。其中有一個矮胖子覷着我這般模樣，便笑首説：［我們也住在本里的。我們爲了本里房客們的太平起見，才發起［太平公醮的］。隨你寫幾個錢都行。］我聽了他的話，才明白他們的來意，便堅决的拒絶道：［我不寫。一個小錢也不寫。不要説我没錢，有錢也不願意做和尚道士的兒子：孝敬他們一筆錢，讓他們見鬼似的閙上一陣騙去一年的衣食住的錢丨其實人們化了錢打醮往往受瘟疫而死的也不少丨我眞不在道製造這些寄生虫和社會有些什麽利益？我把錢寄到東三省給義勇軍買子彈殺我們的敵人，該是多麽有意義，有益的事？</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>妻近來忽然常常生病，由一個爲了保重身體没有疾病也得吃藥的林太太介紹到上海著名諸醫生那兒去診治：據伊的經騐：這位醫生的確能著手成春，藥到病除。我就陪了妻到諸醫生那兒。以四元四角的代價掛了號：因爲去得遲，號單是一五六號。從十一點鐘一直等到下午三點鐘，才挨着妻。我在旁邊看醫生給妻診視，不覺大驚失色。他一邊把指頭放在妻的脈上，眼睛一邊看着一疊别人的藥方，嘴裏報告着藥名。没有五分鐘便診視完畢：另由别人補充。又過了半點鐘才拿到藥方。回家以後，我就把藥方扯了，不許妻吃他的藥，理由是：與其做寃鬼，不如聽其自然，也許不死：不然，可没準兒。</p>

<p>一天，我爲朋友的事去拜訪一個闊人。我在富麗的客廳裏恭候在樓上的過烟癮的闊人的大駕的時候，瞥見院子裏有一個聽差拿了兩大盆香味撲鼻的牛肉喂兩匹大洋狗。我等得也不耐煩了，便踱到院子裏看狗吃牛肉。我無意的問聽差這兩匹狗每天吃多少錢牛肉。他答道：［每天至少三塊錢的牛肉，四毛錢的牛奶。］我不覺呆了：這眞是闊人闊舉了，單是兩匹狗每月就得吃一百多塊錢：拿這個錢去賑濟災民該多麽好。在我眼前似乎看見一大羣的災民在搶着吃己經腐臭的人肉。</p>

<p>染色所用之顔料靛青。自由煤汰油蒸出之物質所製成。所以呼爲煤汰油染料。亦名阿尼林染料。阿尼林者。由煤汰油蒸出之安息油。和之以硝酸。初化爲硝酸基安息油。再經輕有用氣化製。遂成阿尼林。是爲製造顔料靛青之基本原料。阿尼林染料之名詞。即由於是。</p>
<p>兹有本埠顔料業新領袖李叔彦王作霖吴性栽等。聯合各界。發起中孚化學製造廠股份有限公司。資本定一百萬元。由各發起人認定。己逾四十萬元。專事製造顔料靛青。靛青以煤汰油之樟腦。與夫醋酸等物製造之。是爲今之最新製法。該公司曾開發起人大會。公選邱彭年爲招股主席委員。徐新六鄒秉文董榮清等爲籌備委員。互選董榮情爲籌備處主任。李叔彦副之。正在備案。招股諒亦在即。董君畢業於美國潑腦脱工業專門學校化學科。曾經實地考察歐美各大染料廠。而在德國拔地沙廠（愛禮司）實習。嘗任杭州武林造紙廠辦事董事。上海中一化工廠技師等職。又爲中國工程師學會科學社美國化學社等會員。於化學實際工作。富有</p>
<p>經騐。人亦精明幹練而和靄。各界和之者甚多。</p>
<p>查我國進口染料。年值國幣一萬萬元以上。巨大漏巵。自宜亟謀抵制。且染料工廠與國防。甚有關係。蓋供給化學戰争利器也。外侮日甚。尤宜急辦。此種事業。即可生利。又能衛國禦敵。招股時國人必多踴躍投資。可預言也。（該公司設籌備處於廣東路十四號）容容足音。實屬創舉值得我之介紹</p>

<h3 id="c208">縣長罰跪打軍棍 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>縣長爲親民之官，對於人民，最爲接近，故縣長的好壞，對於人民關係最切，非由政府人民，嚴厲監督不可，昨據濟南電，韓復榘十七日，在省</p>
<p>府間案，鄒縣長薛大愚，被控濫罰欵，判令罰跪撤職，罰一千五百元，償人民損失，平原縣長盧覺民，被控在長山任内濫罰欵，判罰跪，責五十棍，罰一千五百元，償人民損失，這種事情，假定偶然聽到，必定詫爲奇聞，似乎一種極出軌的舉動，但是我倒要考量一考量，　　現在各地縣長的貪贓枉法，瀆職殃民，可算是一種極普通的流行性感冒，政府雖頒布官吏懲戒條例己久，並有監察院爲之彈劾，然而貪贓枉法瀆職殃民的官吏，依舊到處活動，推原其故，原因有三，一現在的縣長，多有有力者爲之背景，該縣長等，恃有奥援，肆無忌憚，可置國家典章國法於不願，一、人民畏官吏如畏天帝，即使受寃抱屈至若何程度，總不敢上鋒去控告，深恐官官相護，萬一訟不得直，則爲禍更烈，三則政府雖有官吏懲戒條例，又有監察院，然而未聞有監察妥善的方法，即使官吏天天在外漁肉鄉民，苛征暴罰，政府亦安得而知之，所以法令視若弁髦，毫無顧忌，</p>
<p>若此種縣長非如韓復榘之罰跪責軍棍實無辦法，民國時代，拜跪之禮，早己廢除，罰跪似不對的，并且棍責之刑，用於軍人，這次用於縣長，天然也似不對的，語曰［治亂國用重典］，本來歷代用刑之法，或猛或寛，原無一定標準，祇要使犯罪者所有畏懼就是，所謂殺狗給猢猻看，這種説數，雖不合於現代的潮流，然而極合於貪墨無厭的官吏，這種縣長，只有如此辦法，或者有效，故我對於韓氏之棍責縣長，只有感覺痛快，本來，王子犯法，庶民同罪，這種縣長打幾棍，算什麽事呢，</p>
<p>但是這種辦法，到底只能稱快一時，决非根本辦法，若根本辦法，在政府方面，雖有監察院之設立，然尚須研究如何去監如何去察的方法，若僅僅根據人民的控告，派員去調查調查，萬一人民不敢報告如何，萬一調查員一出毛病，如何，不免就此寃沉海底，故最好的方法，一定使人民監督，較爲接近，較爲親切，人民的痛苦，本該人民來想法，而現在的人民，對於此種事件，緃没有注意及此，眞是怪事，</p>

<p>玻璃的成分通是否灰炭酸鉀和常二氣化硅，</p>

<p>二硬玻璃無色，難融，抵抗藥劑的能力很强，</p>
<p>三鋁玻璃，極軟，易融，重，光線屈折率强</p>
<p>玻璃的用途依着牠的性質而定，　　一普通玻璃製窗板，瓶，和普通的器具，</p>
<p>二硬玻璃製飾品及化學器具，　　三鋁玻璃製飾品及光學器械，玻璃的原料一普通玻璃炭酸鈉或奎酸鈉和木炭二氣化奎，（矽）（砂或石英）炭酸鈣，</p>
<p>二硬玻璃炭酸鉀二氣化硅，炭酸鈣，</p>
<p>三鋁玻璃炭酸鉀，二氣化硅氣化鋁，</p>

<p>— 世</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>L小姐是個十足的摩登學生，每天到校除了幾本教科書之外，還有一本愛情小説同了一只皮夾，這皮夾好像畫錦里的香粉店，凡是一切的化妝品在那裏都可見到。</p>
<p>暑校開學還不到二星期的時候，在同學方面己没有一個不知道她的芳名了，因爲L小姐不但是個摩登的學生，並且還是個交際家呢。</p>
<p>L小姐雖然没有天然的美麗，但具有物質上化妝上的美，己足夠陶醉羣英了。所以到現在她己成了一部份男同學的玩物，且爲他們所利用了。</p>
<p>一天早晨下第一堂課之後，L小姐拉了Ｗ女士到教室外去談話。她説：［Ｗr·Ｃ是ＸＸ中學的品學兼優生，他對你仰慕己久了。你不應如此狠心。我知道這是女人的應有手段，也不能單單怪你。但你得知道Ｗr·Ｃ·爲你冷冷的態度要去尋死了。他説過他要爲愛而犧牲。Ｗ姊你自己去想想吧。别人要爲你死了呢！］這一席話别的不打緊，嚇得Ｗ女士一身冷汗。的確丨這一種含有引誘，恐嚇的話，在一個未經愛的洗禮的女子聽了，是多麽可怕呀！</p>
<p>隔了一天Ｌ小姐又替r·ＷＣ·送了一封粉紅色的情書給Ｗ女士。這一類的情書在假求學之名爲交際花的Ｌ小姐，是很用慣的，但Ｗ女士是個無父母兄弟的孤兒。她的到校來求學是爲將來自立之基。然而她却又是個多情者。這種情書對於W女士很是爲難。</p>
<p>現在W女士已給L小姐引到歧途上去了。她前面兩條不同的路，給於W女士將來的幸福同了愁悶。若W女士再不及早覺悟，恐怕不久就要給Ｌ小姐同化了。</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3 id="c213">改良男女服裝趨於儉約的我見 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 四維</p>
<p>對於改良男女服裝的問題，己有許多人討論過，在下不厭贅疣，再來供献幾句，目下社會狀况，我可以拿三個階級來分别在後面。</p>
<p>甲貴族</p>
<p>乙小康</p>
<p>丙平民</p>
<p>［甲］貴族化的家庭，他們那裏知道物力的維難和來處的不易，當那華燈初上的時候，我們可以看到奢態畢露的貴族化的少爺奶奶們，穿了鮮艶奪目舶來品的衣服，坐了風馳電的汽車，來顯出他們的豪貴，在他們多費幾個金錢，天天換行頭，好似九牛亡一毛，固然無足輕重的，但是也許會引起宵小的覬觎，所謂漫藏誨盜，冶容誨淫！</p>
<p>［乙］小康之家，也許存着趨炎附勢的心理，不得不硬綳塲面，所以他們的衣服，幾乎和貴族化一般，俗語説的驢子跟馬跑，試問那裏能夠跟得上，恐還要踅脚呢。</p>
<p>［丙］平民階級與資産階級，大不相同，都頼自身勞力所得來的酬報，去維持他家庭的生活，譬如商號或公司中的普通職員，月薪僅賺數十元，他們的衣服，儘可儉約些，但是事實上往往不然，尤其是女子，她們從不顧憐到她們的父兄或丈夫汗血換來的金錢，而從儉約方面着想，她們也許會和父兄或丈夫閙新衣服穿呢，丈夫無錢，也要借得來買着穿，這種樣子，豈不是人家所説的死要出風頭嗎？</p>
<p>總而言之，中國目前的現像，不僅靠着幾枝秃筆，和幾張報紙宣傅宣傅，可以改良這種無謂奢侈的習俗，非要從事實上做去不可，况且上中下三等的人們，他們所穿的漂亮的衣服，無非是舶來品居多數，每年流出的金錢，爲數實在可驚，所以我不怕閲者的厭煩，盡量地把牠寫出來，一則爲了儉約，本屬美德，能夠改良習俗，一則爲了大中華民族生存起見，希望國人都要改穿國貨的衣服，以免金錢流出，你們看外國人賺了中國人的金錢，去造槍砲來打中國，那是我們中國人自己的不争氣呀！（移酬助東北義勇軍）</p>

<p>這裏所説的［疙瘩底主人，］是我們同她合居在一幛房子裏的［張師母］。她雖還算得一個有智識人，可是對待一般傭婦們的苛刻，疙瘩，誰見了眞要頭裏發下一陣子昏痛！</p>
<p>她是喜歡在每天清晨披閲我們老申報的一份子：更愛讀這小小的園地［本埠附刋。］所以，我現在特地略舉她最近疙瘩的行動，在這裏發表。希望她看了以後，當時臉上會紅：以後力改前非，不要再幹那種無意識而被人批評爲［像煞有介事］和［神氣活現］的惡主人。</p>
<p>下面就是她疙瘩行動底寫眞。</p>
<p>有一天，她的傭婦呌做秦媽的，買了小菜回來對她説：少奶奶！小菜買好了，請你到灶下去看吧。這原是她日常的行程，生怕傭婦們打誑，買來的東西那要看過的。不料她這次却把杏眼兒發得圓睁睁地説道：你們都變成太太了！買來的小菜都定要我很磨煩地走到灶下去看嗎？秦媽受了這頓無名的訓話，第二天買了小菜回來，馬上就提給她看。會變的她，氣咻咻的又發怒道：呵呀！你痴了嗎？活了這些年紀，難道都移轉到了黃狗身上去？齷齷齪齪的東西，拿到房間裏來，難道你當我斷了腿不會到灶下去看？</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>晚霞張佈得天空像窈窕美女一般地可愛。秦媽因爲詫異爲甚她的女主人還没發開夜飯的命令，乘空就去差她要不要預備開夜飯？她好像見黑漆板凳在旁，撒嬌般更作威道：難道你的狗肚子餓了嗎？怎麽短命催催得急急的！諸位想吧：秦媽下次再敢動問她，討個老大的没趣嗎？可是，又害她震顫肝火了：原來隔了二天的晚上，她見夜飯還没有預備，把秦媽呌了來責問道：電燈也早上了。你是第一天到這裏來？夜飯還怎的不開上來，眞的變成了太太，一切都要恭請！像算盤珠那麽的笨貨！</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>我寫此文的動機，不僅是獻給她，是獻給一切有傭僕的少爺奶奶們的。也是代那些爲了窮，不惜抛棄骨肉來低首作牛馬的傭僕們，向少爺奶奶們呼救的悲哀的聲息。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Professor Piccard's High-Altitude Exploration <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>I have often heard the saying "Saving the nation through science." It means that if China wants to become strong, it must diligently study science. This statement is indeed true. I have also heard the saying "Saving the nation through aviation," meaning that if China wants to resist foreign aggression, it must expand its air force. This statement is also true. However, we only hear these words but do not see them put into practice.</p>
<p>Our people love empty talk and lofty theories. Whatever we think, we immediately express it verbally or write it down, and then consider the matter concluded. How to implement it is not taken into account. This is true for learning and for everything else. Westerners are different. If there is something they do not understand, they think about it. If they gain some insight, they proceed to experiment. If they succeed, they begin to write about it and make it known to the world. Their spirit of valuing experimentation, embracing adventure, and striving for progress is something we cannot match. Professor Piccard's high-altitude exploration is one example of this. Professor Piccard, at 5:05 AM on the 18th, ascended into the high altitude from the Zurich airfield in his self-made balloon to conduct his second measurement in the stratosphere. It is said that the main purpose was to continue studying the so-called "cosmic rays" and to verify various records obtained during his first ascent in May of last year. According to his own wireless report, the balloon's ascent height has exceeded ten miles, surpassing the altitude record previously achieved by manned balloons or airplanes.</p>
<p>Professor Piccard's high-altitude exploration began in September 1930. In that year, Piccard and his assistant planned to ascend in a balloon, but due to inadequate equipment, the balloon failed to lift off temporarily, resulting in failure. In May of last year, he conducted his second experiment. At that time, the balloon's ascent height also reached ten miles, but it suddenly encountered a counter-cyclone and was forced to descend. It drifted in the air for eighteen hours. Therefore, this high-altitude exploration, including the one in 1930, is actually the third time.</p>
<p>High-altitude exploration is not an easy task. The higher one ascends, the thinner the air becomes, making breathing more difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to carry an oxygen respirator. At the same time, the temperature drops, making it extremely cold. Furthermore, according to Piccard's experience from his last exploration, although the temperature outside the aluminum chamber he was in was minus 50 degrees Celsius, the chamber walls became scalding hot due to direct sunlight. The inside felt stiflingly hot, making people unbearably thirsty. The difficult situation can be imagined, and unexpected dangers are even more impossible to prevent in advance.</p>
<p>Why is Professor Piccard conducting this high-altitude exploration? What exactly are the cosmic rays he wants to measure? What contributions will this endeavor make to the scientific and aviation communities? In this short article, it is impossible to describe everything in detail, nor is it necessary. What we should know is that Professor Piccard is undertaking this adventurous act for the sake of progress and discovery in the scientific community, in other words, out of loyalty to learning. As for whether he will succeed or not, we cannot predict it, and even Professor Piccard himself probably has no certainty.</p>
<p>Because Professor Piccard is conducting high-altitude exploration for the sake of scientific progress, scholars from all countries are paying great attention to it and providing strong support. Newspapers are filled with news about it, and aviators and meteorological observatories are providing photographic communications for it. From this, we can see that the enthusiasm of Westerners for science is something we cannot match.</p>
<p>Scientific research cannot benefit from empty talk alone. Strategies for saving the nation cannot be effective through empty talk alone. There must be people who rise up to research and then implement, and there must be a large number of people to support them before great achievements can be made. Today, our people are not like this. Perhaps this is the major reason why China's science is backward and the country is in danger and its people are suffering. Therefore, from now on, we should either stop talking about saving the nation and promoting science, or, like Professor Piccard, be loyal to our cause, not asking about the harvest, but focusing on cultivating the spirit and virtue of diligent work, which is what we should emulate and promote most.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Troop Exercises in Urban Warfare in Beiping <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Japanese soldiers carrying machine guns race through the streets at night.</p>
<p>The diplomatic community was quite uneasy as they had not received prior notification.</p>
<p>A team of Japanese soldiers in Beiping practiced urban warfare near Dongdan Archway on the evening of the 18th and morning of the 19th, and also test-fired machine guns, returning to camp as a team at dawn. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, Japanese soldiers in Beiping also practiced defensive and offensive maneuvers. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After midnight in Beiping, Japanese soldiers, carrying rifles with bayonets and machine guns, raced through the streets, shouting military orders in the darkness. It was said that the guards of the Japanese Legation were conducting machine gun drills on the slopes on both sides of the Legation Quarter. The Japanese authorities had previously notified the Public Security Bureau, so the Bureau dispatched a team of police officers to manage the traffic of vehicles and pedestrians on the streets near the Legation Quarter during the drills. At a time of heightened tension, the sudden actions of the Japanese soldiers, especially as they were carried out at night, naturally aroused suspicion, causing widespread unease. However, the Japanese authorities claimed that the Legation Quarter was densely populated, so they could not conduct these drills on the slopes and nearby streets. The Japanese also stated that these drills were not intended to have any particular meaning, but those pedestrians and local residents who were unaware of the true situation could not help but feel somewhat apprehensive. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers' drills in Beiping actually caused unease in the Beiping diplomatic community. Although the Public Security Bureau had been notified in advance, the leaders of the legation community had not been notified. Although there was no obligation to notify them, it was proper etiquette to do so. However, last night the leaders of the legation community did not receive a single word from the Japanese officers, causing other legations to be just as surprised as the residents. The large scale of this Japanese military exercise was also criticized. The guards of various legations usually conduct drills quietly, passing through the streets without disturbing the residents. This time, the Japanese soldiers actually conducted large-scale urban warfare exercises. Moreover, Beiping is currently very peaceful and there is absolutely no sign of unrest, so there is no need for such a show of force. This incident may not lead to a formal protest to the Japanese Legation, but many feel that the Japanese officers should be reminded that such activities endanger all foreigners, especially as they are carried out at night and could easily lead to incidents. The guards of various legations are jointly responsible for protecting the Legation Quarter, so they feel that they should be informed of such war games in advance, and not be ignored in this way.

<p>Beiping: The Japanese army's attacks on Tongliao have not shown any progress. Some of the volunteer forces have taken refuge in the ten-foot-high sorghum fields and nearby forests to cover themselves from the intense Japanese artillery fire. However, Tongliao is still in the hands of the volunteer army. After dismantling a section of the Tao'an Railway, the volunteer army engaged the Japanese army, fighting continuously for four days and nights, but eventually had to retreat temporarily due to heavy rain.

<p>The Nanjing Huai River Guiding Association is proceeding with the engineering works according to the original plan, which involves both channeling the river into the Yangtze and the sea without conflict. The engineering works that need to be undertaken now are: 1. Constructing a movable dam at the mouth of Hongze Lake in Jiangba to regulate the lake's water level, maintaining a fixed quantity. When there's excess water, the dikes will be opened to release it into the Yangtze; when water volume decreases, the dam will be closed for storage. 2. Dredging Zhangfu River to straighten its course, enabling the water to flow directly into the sea without meandering and siltation. In terms of funding, the original budget for the first five-year phase was over 49 million. However, constructing the movable dam at Hongze Lake requires one million in the first year alone, resulting in a significant shortfall. Efforts are underway to organize and manage the official reclaimed land on both banks, enabling the public and the state to share this substantial expense, making fundraising easier.

<p>The British-Russian Treaty Must Be Abandoned</p>
<p>Ottawa, 18th (Reuters) – The report of the committee studying methods of economic cooperation in all aspects of the Empire at the Economic Conference was submitted to the conference today and has now been passed. The report proposes that each part of the British Empire send two representatives to form a continuing committee to consider the entire organization of the Imperial commercial agency system and to form an advisory board to handle intra-Empire cooperation mechanisms. This continuing committee can complete its report by May of next year. South Africa and South Ireland today opposed the establishment of a permanent Imperial secretariat. Today's work of the conference is to formulate the final draft of the agreement for submission to the plenary session to be closed on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 18th (Reuters) – According to a key Canadian figure, after the British-Canadian agreement of the British Imperial Economic Conference is established, the commercial treaty signed by Britain and Russia in 1930 must be abandoned. A plan for immediate administrative action to deal with the dumping of Russian goods has already been discussed. Although this plan does not explicitly mention Soviet Russia in its wording, it refers to countries that are not part of the British Empire. The issue of Russian goods dumping in British Imperial markets is one of the reasons for the extension of the Ottawa Conference. Canada demands that Russian goods be banned from entering Britain. The British representatives initially seemed unwilling to accept this demand. It is said that Canada is concerned about the dumping of Russian timber in Britain.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 19th (Reuters) – Yesterday, the Australian and British delegations reached an agreement on the important issue of meat after making small concessions to each other. It is now expected that the conference will close on Saturday and Sunday, with almost all the dominions achieving their wishes.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Situation Before the Convocation of the New German Parliament <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Hitler Talks About the Aims of the National Socialist Party</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (National News Agency) – The new German Parliament is scheduled to convene on August 30. This is the result of consultations between the former Speaker, Social Democratic leader Loebe, and Chancellor von Papen, because according to German parliamentary convocation law, the former Speaker must issue a notice to formally convene the parliament. Furthermore, as a result of the recount in the Lindhorst constituency, the Social Democratic Party and the Catholic Center Party each gained one more seat in the new parliament, but there is no major change in the parliamentary organization. Furthermore, Communist MP Mrs. Zetkin previously stated that, based on her qualifications, she should occupy the chair on the opening day of the parliament, pending the transfer of the new Speaker. This has aroused attacks from the National Socialist newspapers, but Mrs. Zetkin is unwilling to give up her rights, so it is expected that there will be a fierce dispute when the new parliament opens. However, this matter does not have much relevance to the prospects of the parliament. What has the greatest impact on the future of the parliament itself is the government. How will the parliament react and what will be its intention after the government announces its policy outline? Since the government is not hesitant to take drastic measures and dissolve the parliament in order to implement its policies.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Reuters) – National Socialist leader Hitler is currently living in a solitary cabin near Berchtesgaden. Today, he told people that it was a misunderstanding that he had told President Hindenburg a few days ago that he wanted Mussolini's position after the March on Rome. The fact that the National Socialist Party has never requested the post of Minister of Defense shows that the National Socialist Party does not want absolute power. Hitler refuted the rumors that the National Socialist Party will march on Berlin, saying that the Nazi stormtroopers do not want to take illegal actions. Hitler denied any intention of eliminating the major companies, but said that the appropriate distribution of assets so that everyone has a share can be a good medicine to resist communism.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Picard's Balloon Lands Safely in Italy <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Zurich, 17th (National News Agency) – After twelve hours in the sky, Professor Picard's balloon landed safely at 5:10 p.m. in the small village of Montebello, Mantua Province, northern Italy. According to the latest news, it had reached a height of eleven miles above the ground. From the departure of the balloon to its landing, journalists from all over the world were chasing after it in cars, hoping to reach the landing place first. As a result, there were many high-speed cars equipped with wireless telegraph receivers, and the occupants were holding telescopes, chasing after the balloon. Although the balloon was at a high altitude, it could be faintly seen through a large telescope. Residents of eastern Switzerland had been searching for the balloon since dawn, all eager to see it first. It is reported that the first report came from the village of Walenstadt, near Obersee, two and a half hours after the balloon's departure, estimating its height at about 49,000 feet. An interesting incident occurred in the Sargans area of eastern Switzerland. A famous aviator, Zuber, was chasing after the balloon in a car. After looking up at the sky for three hours, he finally came to the conclusion that the balloon had not moved. However, when he called Zurich, he learned that Professor Picard had flown into Italy, because he had mistaken Venus for the balloon. (Note: Venus can still be seen shining in the daytime during summer and autumn.) After the balloon flew over Lake Garda and the town of Dezenzano, no fewer than several thousand people attempted to chase after it, either in cars, carriages, or bicycles, and some even on horseback. At about 2 p.m., the balloon appeared over the town of Desenzano in Italy, at a height of about 4,000 feet, slowly drifting south. At this time, it encountered convective air, so it suddenly turned north for a while and then stopped moving for about two hours before slowly descending again and landing near the village of Montebello. For a while, the welcomers gathered together and cheered loudly. After Professor Picard got out of the balloon, he stayed in Montebello and waited for his assistant to unload and fold the balloon and pack up the instruments before they drove together to Desenzano for a welcome banquet from the Italian Air Force. This morning, the Italian Air Force Department instructed the Mantua Air Force to prepare a welcome. When the balloon entered Italy, military aircraft from Verona, Desenzano, and Farella came out to follow the balloon, so Italian Air Force officers were on the scene to take care of it after the balloon landed. According to Picard, the balloon was in the stratosphere for a total of three hours, so there was ample time to carry out measurements.</p>
<p>Milan, 18th (National News Agency) – Professor Picard of the University of Brussels has completely completed his second exploration of the stratosphere and landed safely at 5:10 p.m. in the small village of Cavalairo di Montebello, located between the town of Dezenzano and the town of Volta Mantovana. It had been in the sky for about ten hours since departing from Zurich (Switzerland) at 5:05 a.m. After getting out of the balloon, Picard went to the town of Volta Mantovana.</p>
<p>Desenzano, 18th (National News Agency) – After arriving here tonight, Professor Picard told reporters that although he had encountered great difficulties on this trip, he believed that he had reached a height of 17,000 meters (ie, meters). When he was in the stratosphere, it was very cold, and there was a time when he was worried about freezing to death, but within a few hours, he entered a very hot air current. The moment before landing was the hottest. Today, Italy was covered by a heat wave, and the thermometer reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit (about 36.5 degrees Celsius). Picard also said that he reached a height of 16,500 meters in three hours, at which time the temperature recorded by the thermometer was 36 degrees Celsius below zero (about 32.5 degrees Fahrenheit below zero), and the balloon was drifting in the dark sky. Looking down at the ground, it was hazy and difficult to identify, because at that time, all ordinary maps were useless. However, from all aspects of observation, this trip can be said to be very successful. All kinds of instruments were used extraordinarily. He landed smoothly and expects that all instruments will not be damaged. However, the air bag was slightly damaged due to the rapid deflation. As for the scientific results obtained, Picard did not agree to publish them because he had not yet studied them in detail. He also said that he believed that this trip not only reached 16,500 meters, but also close to 17,000 feet. When the balloon was slowly descending near the ground, the welcomers rushed from all directions. After it landed, the police immediately surrounded the area to prevent it from being damaged. Professor Picard came out of the aluminum chamber, very happy, but also very tired. He rested in the shade for a few minutes, watching the crowd unload the balloon and transport it here.</p>
<p>Tason Steineno, Italy, 19th (Havas) – After Professor Picard landed, Havas reporters interviewed him. According to him, the results of this high-altitude exploration need to be studied for several months before they can be fully understood. He also said that he had reached a height of 16,770 meters. Picard's assistant, Corson, said that during the 12 hours of ascension, Professor Picard worked with scientific instruments for 11 hours. When the balloon landed, the instruments were almost destroyed, but the photos and other items taken were completely intact.</p>
<p>Milan, 18th (Reuters) – Professor Picard landed safely near Tason di Chenzano today, not far from Lake Garda. The balloon had risen to a height of 16,700 meters, and Professor Picard had broken his own record by about 1,000 meters. The balloon was slightly damaged when it landed. Those who were ascending in it were transported from the extreme cold of more than ten miles above the sky to the extremely hot climate of Italy, and although they felt dizzy, they were all safe. More than 40,000 people had watched Professor Picard ascend, but there were not many who watched the balloon descend. After Professor Picard landed, he told people that he was satisfied with the results of this trip. Professor Picard carried many scientific instruments to use in thin air, and he also carried two parachutes in case of an accident for himself and Dr. Cousins. However, Picard was always confident that this adventure would be successful.</p>

<p>Dr. Kon Incarcerated</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Dentsu) – Dr. Kon, who planned to assassinate the Prime Minister and other government leaders, was taken into custody at Ichigaya Prison at 11:00 a.m. today.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Dentsu) – Dr. Kon Yoshio was arrested on suspicion of assassinating Prime Minister Saito, Yamamoto, Takahashi, and other government leaders. It is found that Kon is the attending physician of Dr. Okawa Shumei, who is currently in custody. Angered by the incompetence of the current cabinet, he planned to assassinate Prime Minister Saito in order to overthrow the current cabinet. He conspired with his friend Obayashi Sueichi (Obayashi belonged to the Jinbu Association). Obayashi ordered Shimane Tajiki (24 years old), a delinquent youth of uncertain residence, to carry out the plan and provided him with funds. On June 24, Shimane lingered in a Fushimi public brothel and was very interested in amusement. The authorities suspected him and investigated him. Dr. Kon learned of this and said that this son was not enough to entrust with major events and expelled him. Shimane was furious and displayed his nature, threatening Obayashi with the assassination plan and forcing him to provide money. After several times and the money ran out, he visited Obayashi again and said that if he did not provide money, he would announce the assassination plan to the world. After several such incidents, Obayashi could not bear the disturbance and sued him to the Harajuku police for extortion. Shimane was arrested and confessed everything one by one. Obayashi's statement was considered to be completely unfounded. When the name of Dr. Kon, who had the closest relationship with Dr. Okawa, was mentioned, the conspiracy was completely exposed.</p>

<p>The Hague, 18th (Havas) – The Communist Party originally planned to hold a conference of [Anti-War Groups] in Geneva in October when the League of Nations was in session. Purely socialist or pro-peace groups refused to join because the conference was presided over by Moscow. Subsequently, the Swiss government also banned the conference from being held in its territory. The organizers of the conference turned to holding it in the United Kingdom, but were again rejected by the British government. Finally, the communists chose the capital of the Netherlands as the meeting place, but the Dutch authorities also considered the conference to be of a propaganda nature and did not allow it to be held. Whether or not to allow foreign nationals participating in the conference to enter the country is still under consideration, and the authorities have stated that they reserve the right.</p>

<p>Baltimore, 18th (Reuters) – The Washington dispatch of the local Sun reports that there will be three consultations between Britain and the United States. Britain must support American claims regarding the Manchurian Incident as a condition of recompense for the naval reductions between the two countries.

<p>Totaling US$40 Million</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Havas) – Chase National Bank of America is negotiating with the Soviet government to lend US$40 million to the Soviet Union. The German industrial world was quite alarmed after this news was released. Although the amount of this loan is not very large, its impact is very significant. The establishment of this loan will not only make the United States recognize the Soviet Union, but the United States will also allow the cancellation of pre-war Russian debts. In order to obtain this benefit, the Soviet Union will not hesitate to give the United States a large number of concessions. It is said that it has been proposed in the US-Russia negotiations to reduce the discount rate of Soviet Union drafts, so that the Soviet Union can complete its industrial equipment under more favorable conditions. Germany must pay attention to the establishment of this negotiation, because the Soviet Union has always been the largest customer of German industrial orders.</p>

<p>London, 18th (Reuters) – The crisis of the Lancashire cotton industry strike is worsening. It is expected that 250,000 workers will be unemployed by the end of August. Both sides are still holding firm. Many workers have already stopped working. The cotton mills everywhere are still open, although the strike date is set to begin on August 27, the number of workers working in several mills is now very few. British Prime Minister MacDonald is currently resting in the countryside but is in close contact with the Minister of Labor regarding the labor unrest. Newspapers expect the government to intervene within a few days to prevent the Lancashire strike from being realized.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Transatlantic Round Trip <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - British aviator Morrison departed from Dublin this morning at 11:35 AM, planning a round-trip flight across the Atlantic. He intends to complete the journey within three to four days. His single-seat aircraft, named "Heart's Content," is a Moth type, carrying 165 gallons of fuel, sufficient for 33 hours of flight. The plane's speed is 130 miles per hour. The weather at departure was favorable, with a slight breeze. Thousands of spectators were present, some arriving as early as 4 AM. Morrison hopes to cross the Atlantic in 22 hours and land in Harbor Grace, Newfoundland, for refueling, before continuing to New York. He carries a letter from the Mayor of Dublin to the Mayor of New York.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 18th - A wireless message was just received from the owners of the steamer Ascania, stating that at approximately 4 PM (Greenwich Mean Time), at 52 degrees 22 minutes North latitude and 20 degrees 32 minutes West longitude, they encountered Morrison's aircraft crossing the Atlantic. The plane was south of the ship's course and flying very low. Upon seeing the ship, it flew over.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 18th - Today, the Berliner Tageblatt published a statement by Chinese Minister Liu Wen-tao, forcefully refuting the inappropriate remarks made by Japanese Army Minister Araki in Tokyo to a special correspondent of the newspaper. He stated that General Araki's claim that Manchuria holds a crucial life-or-death interest for Japan blatantly disregards the fact that Manchuria is Chinese territory inhabited by 30 million Chinese people. Araki also mentioned that Japan had fought two wars in Manchuria, against China and Russia. If that were the case, then Britain and the United States, having sent troops to participate in the European War, could also claim similar rights in northern France and Belgium. Regarding Japan's demand for special interests in Manchuria, China has consistently expressed its willingness to submit disputed cases to the International Court of Justice in The Hague or to arbitration. However, Japanese militarists and imperialists refuse to seek a peaceful and fair solution that would satisfy both parties. Minister Liu also solemnly stated that Japan often cites its massive investments in Manchuria. However, international investment currently spans the globe, including substantial foreign investment in Japan itself. If that were the case, could foreign investors use this as a basis to claim Japanese territory? Furthermore, he emphatically denied the claim that the Chinese government and people harbor animosity towards foreigners, but stated that if foreign people attempt to illegally invade Chinese territory or seek to forcibly seize special rights, they naturally cannot expect the sympathy of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Stalin to Deliver Broadcast Speech <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 18th - Soviet leader Stalin will, within a few days, deliver a broadcast speech in English from the Russian capital to the entire world, with particular emphasis on the United States. According to reliable sources, Stalin's message will generally align with the new policy of mutual understanding between Russia and the United States. Furthermore, it has been announced that Stalin is also preparing to broadcast a speech to the United States via radio in mid-September.

<p>Reuters, Madrid, 19th - Last night, the parliament passed a bill confiscating the property of landowners involved in the recent coup with 262 votes in favor and 14 against. The bill stipulates that the property outside city limits of those who directly or indirectly participated in the recent restoration coup against the Spanish Republican government will be confiscated. Consequently, the vast estates of the Duke of Medina Sidonia and the Duke of Infantado will be lost. Furthermore, the Marquis of Esquilache will lose his fertile vineyards because he allowed General Sanjurjo, the leader of the recent rebellion, to reside in his Seville residence. Landowners whose property is confiscated will only be allowed to receive a stipend sufficient for their living expenses. The land confiscated by the government will be used for national agricultural reform.</p>

<p>A Bomb Discovered at Mayor Zhou's Residence</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Lodges Protest over Zhongyuan Incident</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondent, 14th - Following the bomb incident at the Zhongyuan Company on the afternoon of the 14th, Japanese goods merchants were quite alarmed. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 16th), which was the Mid-Autumn Festival, two more bomb incidents occurred. In my previous report on the Zhongyuan bomb incident, I predicted that such bomb incidents would continue to occur. Unfortunately, my prediction has come true. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>At 9:40 AM on the 16th, two young men, identified as A and B, were seen loitering in front of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce on North Road. They were about twenty years old, wearing summer cloth long gowns, academic straw hats, and Sun Yat-sen style canvas shoes. Young man A went towards Wanshou Palace Alley next to the Chamber of Commerce, while young man B took out some small denomination bills and exchanged them for copper coins at Dong Chunlin's money exchange stall. He was identified as having a southern accent. While Dong Chunlin was looking down to get the copper coins, this person placed a package under a car parked in the Chamber of Commerce passageway. The car belonged to Zhang Pinting, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. Unexpectedly, Dong Chunlin caught sight of it and grabbed young man B. The young man calmly pulled out a pistol and said, "Let go! This is none of your business. We are the Iron-Blood Assassination Corps, warning traitorous</p>
<p>merchants!" Upon seeing the pistol, Dong immediately released him. The person then entered Wanshou Palace Alley. Dong immediately reported to Yang Mingqing, a guard from the 15th Watch Post of the 1st Precinct of the 3rd District. Yang, because Wanshou Palace Alley was under the jurisdiction of the 1st Precinct of the 3rd District, did not pursue him. The bomb under the car then exploded, shaking the buildings and sending thick smoke everywhere. Pedestrians</p>
<p>scattered in panic, and order was disrupted. The two young men, A and B, took advantage of the chaos, turned back from Wanshou Palace Alley, crossed North Road, and escaped into Niujia Alley. Less than three minutes later, a bomb also exploded inside the Chongqing Foreign Fabric Store in Wanshou Palace Alley. As a result, merchants and residents closed their doors, trams stopped running, and Yun Zhongwu, Chief of the 3rd Precinct, along with patrol officers Wang Hongru and Chen Yizhou, and over twenty armed police officers, rushed to the scene. Soon after, Xu Zishu and Guo Youzhen, Deputy Chiefs of the Second Detachment of the Public Security Bureau's Special Police, also arrived with over ten officers. Finally, the Security Team also arrived and conducted an extensive search in the vicinity. By 10:30 AM, nothing had been found, and traffic was restored. After investigation, the car's engine block had been shattered, and the car windows had been destroyed. The glass windows and doors of Gao Zhikui's flower shop next door to the Chamber of Commerce were also destroyed. No one was injured. As for Chongqing Fabric Store, which also trades in cotton yarn, they have a representative stationed in Osaka to handle business. According to the store's manager, Li Jianqiu, and accountant, Li Yuxiao, at around 9:40 AM, they saw a young man walk to the passageway inside the second gate and place a package there. Realizing something was wrong, they ran to take cover, and the young man also turned and left. The manager was about to use the telephone to report to the police district, when the bomb in the package</p>
<p>exploded, blasting a hole in the brick floor two feet in diameter and about eight or nine inches deep. There were bomb marks in several places on the wall. According to Li Jianqiu, their store used to trade in Japanese goods in its early years, but in the autumn of the ninety-ninth year of the Republic of China (1930), they withdrew their representative from Osaka and switched to trading in Russian printed cloth. A few days ago, they received a warning letter from the Assassination Corps and had anticipated that a bomb would occur, so they instructed the staff to be constantly vigilant. Zhang Pinting, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, stated that in the past half-month, they had received letters signed "Blood Soul Assassination Corps," "China Save the Nation Punish Traitors Corps," "Youth Iron</p>

<p>Continued Important News</p>
<p>Blood Assassination Corps," "Assassination Bombing Corps," and others, criticizing the Chamber of Commerce for failing to persuade merchants to stop selling Japanese goods. The Chamber of Commerce immediately sent letters to various trade associations, advising them to arouse their conscience and stop selling Japanese goods. However, the Chamber of Commerce is composed of various trade associations and can only advise merchants not to sell Japanese goods, without the power to force them not to sell Japanese goods. After the September 18th Incident, various merchants organized a Merchant Voluntary Economic Boycott of Japan Committee, but because it was ineffective, it was heavily criticized by people in society and dissolved informally. Today's bomb incident was expected long ago. However, the Chamber of Commerce has no power to force those cold-blooded animals not to sell. We hope that people in society will understand our difficulties. We have already reported the bombing situation to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Municipal Party Headquarters. Today, the Public Security Bureau issued a circular to all urban and rural police districts and security teams, special task force teams, instructing them to pay attention to pedestrians in prosperous streets and lanes, deploy armed detectives at major intersections on each street, take serious precautions, and advance and extend the curfew time by one hour each night. The Second Army Headquarters also ordered the Tianjin Gendarmerie Team to cooperate with the Security Team in conducting serious patrols. If such incidents occur again in the future, the relevant personnel will be held accountable and severely punished by the police and gendarmerie.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, former Mayor Zhang Xueming and current Mayor Zhou Longguang have repeatedly suppressed the patriotic movements of the people. On the 14th of this month, a box of Mid-Autumn Festival gifts was sent to Mayor Zhou by mail. The place of posting was No. 200, Neiwubu Street, Beijing, Iron Residence Sealed. It was opened by Section Chief Mu Daohou, with Zhou also present. Unexpectedly, the box contained a bomb. Zhou was very frightened. After investigation, the bomb was fifteen inches long and weighed fifteen pounds. After the detonator was removed and the explosives poured out and inspected, it was confirmed to be a powerful bomb. If the box had been opened carelessly at the time, there would have been a risk to life. A letter was also attached to the box, also warning not to suppress the patriotic movement any further. Recently, security at the Municipal Government has been particularly tightened. No one can enter without a pass.</p>
<p>After receiving reports from the Japanese Police Station and Japanese Gendarmerie Team regarding the Zhongyuan Company bomb incident, Goto, the Japanese Deputy Consul in Tianjin, believed that it was an anti-Japanese movement. In addition to reporting to the Consul General to protest to the Provincial Government, he visited Mayor Zhou Longguang at 3:00 PM on the 15th and lodged a verbal protest. Zhou refuted him, saying that the incident occurred in the Japanese Concession and that no evidence had been obtained to indicate that it was an anti-Japanese act. At 4:00 PM on the 16th, Goto went to the Municipal Government again to protest and was received by Secretary He Tingliu. Goto also stated that the bomb incidents at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chongqing Fabric Store that day were clearly anti-Japanese movements and demanded strict suppression to prevent the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations and the occurrence of misunderstandings. Secretary He agreed to convey it to the Mayor for handling. It is reported that the Municipal Government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to issue a notice that if any acts that obstruct public order occur again in the future, those who are arrested or reported will be punished in accordance with martial law and will not be lenient.</p>
<p>Since the 16th, Shinsaka Kyoichi, the Chief of the Japanese Concession Police Station, who was given two major demerits due to the Zhongyuan bomb, has been strictly searching the residences of merchants and residents and inspecting pedestrians entering the Japanese Concession at each intersection between the Chinese and Japanese areas. When trams enter the Japanese Concession, they must also stop for inspection. At night, sandbags and electric wire nets are placed on Akashi Street and Fukushima Street, and armored vehicles patrol, resembling the tense situation during the Tianjin Incident last year. As a result, residents of the Japanese Concession are panicking and the market is declining. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Noulens Sentenced to Life Imprisonment <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Noulens Were Silent</p>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court tried the case of Noulens and Wang Deli for endangering the Republic of China. After more than ten court sessions, the defense concluded on the 17th, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the 19th. When the court session began at 9:00 AM that morning, security inside and outside the court was very tight. All spectators were searched by the police before entering the courtroom. After the judges took their seats, Noulens and Wang were brought into the court. The clerk first read the records of the 15th and 16th, which were translated by translator Yang Zhaolong. Noulens made some defenses regarding the procedures of the police opening the box for inspection and the doubts about the form of the key and the evidence, and supplemented his statements. After proper consideration, it was corrected until 12:00 noon. Chief Judge Li Mian announced that, based on all the evidence that Noulens and Wang Deli had committed crimes, the purpose was nothing more than disturbing public order, colluding with rebels, inciting the army, and disrupting discipline. It was a violation of Articles 1, 2, and 4 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China, Articles 2 and 1 of Article 2, and Article 6, (the crime under Article 5 of the same law for which the prosecutor brought charges was declared innocent due to lack of evidence) and Article 74 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of China. They should each be sentenced to one death penalty and merged. Now, in accordance with Article 2 of the Amnesty Act, each is sentenced to life imprisonment. If the defendants are not satisfied, they can appeal to the Supreme Court within ten days after the judgment is served, and the appeal should be forwarded to this court. After the verdict was announced, Noulens and Wang Deli were silent and looked calm. They were dismissed from the court at 12:30. The main text of the judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court Criminal Division No. 69 Public Notice, Case of Noulens, etc. for Endangering the Republic of China, Judgment Main text: Noulens and Wang Deli jointly disturbed public order with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. Each is sentenced to life imprisonment and life-long deprivation of civil rights. The steel boxes (with keys), four envelopes, six yuan and eight jiao four fen, eight hundred and twenty-three US dollars, one hundred and fifty Japanese yen, and the original documents in the case of criminal evidence are all confiscated, and the rest are innocent.

<p>(Question) The defendant's answers are always either unanswered or irrelevant. If this continues, it will not be concluded for several years. (Question) The defendant's answer is to oppose each and every argument, and to oppose being denied a defense. (Question) The defendant roared in court, so he had to be ordered out of court in accordance with the law. (Answer) The defendant does not understand Chinese, says there are questions, says the trial is unfair, and asks to speak. (Question) Does your lawyer defend or not? (Answer) Regarding the doubts about Article 299 of the Criminal Procedure Law, I first request that it be resolved before defending. (Question) Legal points need to be discussed in detail today, so the court is adjourned for twenty minutes to hold a deliberation meeting. Then the Chief Judge and two judges retired to hold a deliberation meeting for about twenty minutes, and then returned to the court and took their seats. (Question) Does your lawyer defend the qualification of election or not? (Answer) I will not defend the qualification of election before the doubts and Song's interpretation. If it is a designated qualification, then wait for instructions. (Question) Noulens and your lawyer have signed a new contract, the qualification of election has been re-determined, and there is no need to designate it again. The designated qualification is now revoked, please continue to defend in accordance with the qualification of election. (Answer) I must consult with the client first and then defend, or please postpone the date. (Question) The date cannot be changed, and the application to change the date is rejected. If you do not defend, the judgment will be made in accordance with Article 26, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. (Answer) There should be an opportunity for the lawyer to discuss with the client. The application to change the date is different from the application to withdraw. (Question) Whether to defend or not is up to your lawyer to decide. (Answer) A special situation occurred today, and a postponement is requested because the defendant has requested to review more than 70 kinds of evidence, which has not yet been reviewed. This case is very large, and life is at stake, so it cannot be taken lightly. If the client does not express Zhu, the defender has no basis. (Question) If you do not defend, the court will proceed with the defense in accordance with the law. It is your lawyer's responsibility. The debate must end today. (Answer) The evidence is sufficient, and I now apply again to change the date. Please note in the record that the lawyer is prepared to defend today, but not formally defend, and the witnesses Ding Zhensheng and Pan A da have not yet arrived to confront each other. (Question) This has been confronted in the Shanghai court. (Answer) The lawyer's second application is that the evidence has not been fully investigated and there are still opinions to be expressed. Now it is 12 o'clock, please the court postpone the hearing to avoid rashness. (Question) The date cannot be changed, it has already been ruled. Please your lawyer still defend in accordance with the law. (Answer) This is a crime of endangering the Republic of China, and witnesses and evidence must be investigated and cannot be rash. (Question) Are there any more defense opinions, please express them quickly. (Answer) Please give a full debate. Then the two sides debated the law for a long time. It was already 1 pm, and Attorney Chen said that the legal hour had arrived, and still asked to allow a change of date to be defended again. The Chief Judge said that the debate must end today no matter what, and each has a legitimate reason, your lawyer can raise a defense, if there is no legitimate reason, this court will announce the end of the debate. (Answer) There are many legitimate reasons that must be put forward for defense, but now it is past noon, please allow me to eat before appearing in court again. (Question) This court is also accompanying you without eating, your lawyer has an opinion, please express it, that is, after the debate ends, if there is an opinion, it can still be supplemented in writing. (Answer) I request that the debate cannot end today. (Question) Since you have nothing to say, I will announce the end of the debate today and set the date for the verdict on the 19th. Then the court was adjourned, and it was already 1:20. (End)</p>

<p>Begging for Food with a Golden Bowl in Hand</p>
<p>At 4 PM on the 13th, Mr. Yang Hucheng hosted a banquet for all the members of our survey team at the Provincial Government. Due to a conflict with the opening time of the China Science Society's annual meeting, we did not go until after 5 PM. The Provincial Government is located in the center of the city and was originally the site of the former imperial Forbidden City, so it has a large area. Walking and walking again, after entering the gate and walking for several minutes, we arrived at the Great Hall where the banquet was held. The hall was built by Mr. Feng Huanzhang and is magnificent and very impressive. It can be seen that although Feng was frugal, he did not hesitate to invest in the Provincial Government, which is related to the appearance of China and foreign countries, and paid great attention to it. At that time, because we were early, we went to the city wall behind the hall to climb and look into the distance. Feng grieved over the relics of ancient people and thought about the vicissitudes of life, and could not help but sigh.</p>
<p>At 6 PM, someone clapped and waved from below, instructing us to come down from the wall and take our seats. So we went down the wall in single file and gathered in front of the Great Hall to take pictures. After taking pictures, we took our seats according to the positions arranged in the seating chart. Three long tables were set up in parallel lines, with Mr. Yang Hucheng in the center as the chairman. After the music started, Zhao Shouyu, Director of the Construction Department, gave a welcome speech on behalf of Yang, who was unwell. Mr. Zhao said briefly: [In the past, many people came to Shaanxi, but they came with soldiers, exploiting the people, and invading Shaanxi. This time, the members of the survey team sacrificed the prosperity of the city and came to Shaanxi, which is very backward in terms of materials, to develop Shaanxi and to open up a new life for the people of Shaanxi. Shaanxi has suffered from drought and famine for many years, and has tasted the rare suffering of the world. Although it has abundant treasures, it cannot avoid the hungry people on the road. Because they lack science and education, they abandon their goods on the ground and do not know how to collect them. As a result, the people of Shaanxi seem to be holding golden bowls and silver chopsticks in their hands, and still begging people for food. It is really pitiful:] Mr. Zhao's beautiful words, gestures and tone were all very good, and this speech won unanimous applause from all the guests. The guests who gave replies included Qian Zongyong, Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, and Hu Shuhua. At that time, Yang Wangxi was wearing a blue crepe gown, and his demeanor was gentle and elegant. Apart from his bright and energetic eyes, it was impossible to tell that he was a soldier.</p>
<h3 id="e79">The High Price of Duck and Low Price of Chicken in Xi'an <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>On the 14th, we conducted price surveys in various parts of Xi'an. The high cost of certain items truly surprised us. For example, roast duck is six yuan per bird, Kwong Sang Hong brand fruit syrup is one yuan and forty cents per bottle, fish is three and a half yuan per pound, soda is eight cents per bottle, gasoline is ten yuan per case, and leather wine is one yuan and eighty cents per bottle. These prices made us gasp. Chicken, however, is very cheap, with four or five fat chickens costing only one yuan. Chicken eggs can be purchased for one hundred and twenty or more per yuan. Shanxi silk coal costs about two yuan and sixty cents per hundred pounds, reaching about forty-four yuan per ton, which is indeed the highest coal price in the world. It is said that coal from the mining area can be purchased for two hundred pounds per yuan, but it is transported by waterway along the Yellow River to Tongguan, then from Tongguan to Weinan, and finally from Weinan to Xi'an. Once transportation costs are added, the price of coal increases accordingly. The transportation cost between Weinan and Xi'an alone is eight cents per hundred pounds of coal. The other costs can be imagined. In addition, coal from Yaozhou costs about two yuan and eighty cents per hundred pounds. Yaozhou is in northern Shaanxi and not far from Xi'an. The coal is transported by carts. A single-horse cart is called a "set" (the same applies to other sets). A single-horse cart can carry eight hundred to nine hundred pounds of coal, a two-horse cart can carry about one thousand five hundred pounds, a three-horse cart can carry about two thousand pounds, and a four-horse cart can carry about two thousand five hundred pounds. The transportation cost is about one yuan and one dime per hundred pounds. As for coal from Hancheng, due to its poor quality, sales are not high.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the high price of fish and duck is due to the lack of waterways, and the high price of coal is due to inconvenient transportation. Generally speaking, if Shaanxi's waterway and transportation problems are not resolved, then the province's industry will have no hope of development. Therefore, if the Longhai Railway line can be extended to Xi'an, it will provide a lifeline for the people of Shaanxi and a stable guarantee for the development of the Northwest. We also spoke with grain merchants and obtained the following results regarding various commodity prices:</p>
<p>Wheat: 22 yuan per dan (approximately 250-260 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Barley: 26 yuan per dan (approximately 260 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Millet: 15 yuan per dan (approximately 260 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Yellow beans: 13 yuan per dan (approximately 240 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Oats: 7 yuan per dan (approximately 160 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Sesame: 20 yuan per dan (approximately 220 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Vegetable oil: 40 cents per catty</p>
<p>Flour: 25 yuan per dan (approximately 260 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Corn: 10 yuan per dan (approximately 230 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Buckwheat: 10 yuan per dan (approximately 220 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Mung beans: 14 yuan per dan (approximately 230 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Rapeseed: 30 yuan per dan (approximately 220 catties per dan)</p>
<p>Sorghum: 5 yuan per dan (approximately 140-150 catties per dan)</p>
<p>: 13 yuan per dan (approximately 220-230 catties per dan)</p>
<p>As for the production and sales of various grains, there are no statistics available, so we can only inquire. In terms of finance, only the Shaanxi Provincial Bank and the Bank of Communications have no plans to establish branches in Xi'an. Furthermore, because we did not have enough time, we plan to conduct further investigations upon our return.</p>
<p>The famous Yanchang Petroleum has not been sold to Xi'an since 1926. The reason is that the production is scarce and can only be used for nearby areas, with no surplus to enter Xi'an. In fact, even if the oil from Yanchang could be transported to Xi'an, with Yanchang being about 750 li away from Xi'an, it would take one person and one donkey 12 days to travel. The transportation cost for each case of oil would be about five yuan. Adding the cost of about five yuan per barrel, the selling price may not be able to compete with Mobil Oil. Regarding this issue, there are other experts conducting investigations. After a field visit to Yanchang, a report will be provided. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Robbery of a monastery in the city. The Beichan Temple, commonly known as Maqi Temple, located inside the Dongmen (East Gate), is presided over by the monk Haiming of the Fu sect. It was robbed once in the past. Unexpectedly, at around 10 o'clock the previous night, the abbot Haiming and the monks were out chanting scriptures and had not returned. Suddenly, four men wearing gray clothes arrived, claiming to be checking for deserters. They immediately produced weapons and ordered the incense keepers not to make any noise. The thugs broke into each meditation room and looted for about a quarter of an hour before leaving swaggeringly. When the abbot Haiming and the monks returned to the temple and inspected everything, the losses included more than fifty yuan in cash and clothing.</p>

<p>The Construction Department Strictly Pursues the Acreage Tax for Road Construction. The Construction Department of Jiangsu Province previously submitted a proposal to the provincial government for discussion and decided that half of the road construction acreage tax from each county should be handed over to the province to cover the construction expenses of national and provincial roads. The provincial government has issued a notice to all counties to comply and the Construction Department has jointly formulated rules with the Finance Department and issued them to all counties to implement the reporting and payment starting in July of this year. The funds are designated to be deposited in the preparatory office of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Bank. Yesterday, Dong, the director of the Construction Department, telegraphed Chen, the county magistrate of Wuxi, ordering him to supervise the Finance Bureau to submit and report half of the road construction acreage tax collected in July as soon as possible. Any delay that would cause the loss of public funds would be severely punished.</p>
<p>Seventeen Prisoners Granted Amnesty in Xiyi. After receiving the order from the High Court to issue the Amnesty Regulations and the Recidivism Prevention Regulations, the County Court has begun to register the prisoners in the county who are eligible for amnesty and commutation and report them to Wang Simo, the chief prosecutor of the High Court, for review. It has now been determined that the following seventeen prisoners in Wuxi are eligible for the Amnesty Regulations and are approved for release: Zhou Jiaji, Gao Gengen, Song Peigen, Wang Dajin, Zhu Awu, Wang Zhicheng, Chen Runzhi, Sun Xiaoxizi, Bao Genbao, Gu Gengsheng, Su Xiancai, Zheng Asan, Han Baoqing, Tao Jin'er, Fan Baolin, Zhang Fengsheng, and Tang Axi. As for the prisoners who should have their sentences commuted, a list will be compiled and submitted to the court for review.</p>
<p>Rain for Farmland. The county has been suffering from a three-month drought, and both high and low-lying rice fields have been dried up. The farmers are extremely anxious. At around 7 p.m. on the 12th of this month, there was a sudden downpour of about two inches. The countryside received only a slight drizzle, which brought some comfort to the people. The weather has turned autumnal in recent days. Yesterday (the 18th) at around 9 p.m., there was another heavy autumn rain, which lasted until the next morning. The city received about 0.5-0.6 inches of rain. The surrounding areas, such as Dongting, Jiangxi Bridge, Qianqiao, Yangting, Chang'an Bridge, Zhangjing Bridge, Qianzhou, Yuqi, Bei Qifang, and Shitangwan, received about an inch of rain.

<p>Cocoon Ship and Navigation Ship Robbed Simultaneously. At around 4 a.m. yesterday morning, a small barge carrying eight packages of dried cocoons and eight passengers, owned by Yang A'ba, sailed from Qingyang Town in Cheng County to Wuxi. Unexpectedly, when it passed the vicinity of the Shangshu Temple in Baitangwei, Ni'jiawan, it was suddenly attacked by a pirate ship. Seven pirates jumped out, each wielding firearms, bayonets, and other weapons. They boarded the ship, silenced the passengers, and looted at will. Seven packages of dried cocoons, three dou of white rice belonging to the passengers, thirty-seven yuan in cash, and other scattered items were robbed. After the pirates had plundered their loot and were about to escape, a night navigation ship sailing from Wuxi to Qingyang happened to pass by the area and was robbed simultaneously, losing fifty-four packages of cotton yarn, one roll of Luo sieve, and thirty yuan in cash. After the pirates had fully looted, they returned to their pirate ship, raised their sails, and fled. Lin Rinquan, the owner of the navigation ship, and Yang A'ba, the owner of the barge, seeing the pirate ship fleeing, hired two fishing boats and pursued them closely. They chased them to the vicinity of Hujia Ferry, where it was already dawn and there were pedestrians on the motor road along the bank. Yang and others shouted loudly while continuing their pursuit. Local villagers on the shore called the county government to report the incident. The county dispatched political police officer Wang Wenzhi and others to pursue them by car. They spotted the pirates near Xicun. Seeing the situation was not good, the pirates abandoned their boat and landed, fleeing in the direction of Chang'an Bridge. The original stolen goods were found on the pirate ship, but the cash had been taken away. Wang Wenzhi and others took the pirate ship back to the city to report to the county for handling.</p>

After the election, Zhang Jinshi, the county representative No. 3, said, "Director Zhang, please pay attention to the fact that this election has been completely manipulated by the old executive and supervisory committee members. The Gaoyou County Party Department and the entire Gaoyou have always been controlled by a small number of party members. They discussed this election in advance, and the election is just a formality." Jinshi will report the details of their malpractice to the Provincial Party Department in a separate article, etc. The closing ceremony was held at 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>A Disturbance Occurred During the Election in the Tenth District. Gu Jichang, the chief of the tenth district of the county, was previously ordered to handle the election of township chiefs. When the township chiefs of Zhaohe Town, Zhoujin Township, Guoqiao Township, and Xiaji Township were elected at the County No. 2 Elementary School the day before yesterday, Jin Ruijun, the leader of the district regiment, suddenly led his younger brother Ruizhen and armed militiamen to the scene and demanded blank ballots from Chief Gu. Because Gu refused, he was beaten and insulted, and the militiamen were ordered to disperse the public, which aroused public indignation. Currently, Chief Gu and the heads of the various townships, the heads of the farmers' associations, and the public have filed complaints with the Ministry of Interior, the Department of Civil Affairs, the County Government, and other agencies, requesting that the regiment leader be arrested and severely punished.</p>

<p>Investigating Smuggling of Military Supplies in Various Ports.

In view of the current disaster situation and the restlessness of the bandits and communists, it is difficult to guarantee that they are not smuggling military supplies in an attempt to launch a riot. In addition to ordering his subordinates to pay attention, he requested the County Magistrate to strictly order the Public Security Bureau to send more officers to the above-mentioned ports to conduct strict inspections to prevent chaos. County Magistrate Zhang ordered the Public Security Bureau's police team and special police team to cooperate with the security regiment to investigate various ports along the river and sea on the 18th.</p>

<p>Yuan Dunli Reports on the Review Results</p>
<p>First, Yuan Dunli, the chairman of the group, made an oral report on the review results obtained from previous small group meetings (the same as the written report, omitted). After the report, the chairman handed it over to the general meeting for discussion. The main points of each review result and the discussion situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>There are many proposals in this group. The results of the review and merger are as follows. Among them, (1), (2), (3), and (4) belong to the administrative aspects, (5) and (6) belong to the financial aspects, and (7), (8), and (9) belong to the meeting organization aspects.</p>
<p>(1) Educational administrative organs at all levels should set up physical education supervisors. The Ministry of Education, departments and bureaus should quickly set up physical education supervisors and instructors to supervise the local and school physical education facilities, plans, and improvements. Based on facts, make important suggestions.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Education, departments, and bureaus should set up physical education committees and add physical education sections, departments, groups, and specialize in the design and administrative matters of school and social physical education in their respective jurisdictions under the Social Education Division. (3) [Proposed National Physical Education Administrative System Case] A central physical education association should be set up in the central government, and physical education associations at all levels should be set up separately in provinces, cities, counties, districts, and villages.

<p>(4) National martial arts departments should be set up in sports fields in various provinces, cities, and counties to promote them.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to the physical education fees paid by students, physical education funds at all levels of schools should be determined in the budget and stipulate that the number should account for at least 5% of the total school expenses (but the principle is that student physical education fees should not be collected; some also advocate that student fees should not be excluded from the 5%).</p>

<p>(I) Proposal for Establishing Physical Education Supervisors in Educational Administrative Organs at All Levels</p>
<p>Liu Shenzhan explained the necessity of having an independent physical education administrative organization and funding.</p>
<p>Yuan Dunli argued that physical education is part of education, and physical education administration cannot be independent.</p>
<p>Zhou Gan and Shao Rugan agreed with Yuan's view. Shao said that physical education administration is different from the National Martial Arts Institute, which is a research institution, and cannot be independent.</p>
<p>Wu Bangwei and Ma Yuehan said that as long as practical measures can be implemented, independence or non-independence is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Chairman Chu, representing Minister Zhu, explained that the Ministry of Education agreed to the establishment of physical education supervisors.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting said that since the government is paying attention to promoting physical education, its effectiveness will be greater than that of the people's promotion, and advocated passing the proposal according to the review opinions.</p>
<p>Chen Shizhen argued that the Ministry of Education's office could specifically establish a physical education supervisor's office, but independent establishment in each county seems impossible.</p>
<p>Yuan Dunli and others agreed with Chen Shizhen's opinion.</p>
<p>Shao Rugan proposed amending the review proposal to "[Ministry of Education office to quickly establish a physical education supervisor, education bureau to establish inspectors and instructors]." After Xu Zhiyi's amendment, "[inspectors and instructors]" was changed to "[instructors]". The proposer accepted the amendment. Wu Yunrui, Yuan Dunli, Chen Shizhen, and others seconded the proposal. The proposal was established. The chairman put it to a vote, and the majority approved, resolving that the Ministry of Education office quickly establish a physical education supervisor and the education bureau quickly establish physical education instructors to guide the facilities, plans, and improvements of local and school physical education in their jurisdictions, and to make essential suggestions based on facts.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Passed: Physical Education Administration to Be Handled by Educational Organs at All Levels <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(II) Educational administrative organs at all levels should each establish a physical education committee and add physical education sections, divisions, and teams under the Social Education Department, divisions, and bureaus. Chairman Chu said that this proposal and the third proposal have different opinions on the organization of physical education administration and should first discuss whether the organization of physical education administration should be independent.</p>
<p>Xu Zhiyi and others argued that physical education administration should fall within the scope of education administration. After discussion, the majority agreed with Xu's argument.</p>
<p>The chairman put it to a vote and passed, resolving that physical education administration be handled by educational administrative organs at all levels.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Passed: Educational Administrative Organs at All Levels Should Establish Physical Education Committees and Separate Physical Education Sections <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>(III) Physical Education Administration Should Be Handled by Educational Administrative Organs at All Levels</p>
<p>I. Chairman Chu announced that this review proposal would be put to discussion.</p>
<p>II. Gu Shusen and Xu Zhiyi argued that physical education is not only related to social education but also to the higher education and general education divisions within the Ministry of Education. The phrase "[under the Social Education Department divisions and bureaus]" in this proposal should be deleted.</p>
<p>III. Chen Shizhen said that the physical education committee seems to have already stipulated administrative functions. Whether to set up another section should be discussed.</p>
<p>IV. Yuan Dunli argued that the physical education committee should be discussed first as to whether it should be established.</p>
<p>V. The chairman put to a vote whether educational administrative organs at all levels should establish physical education committees. All agreed and passed, resolving that educational administrative organs at all levels should establish physical education committees.</p>
<p>VI. Chairman Chu put to discussion whether to establish a section outside the physical education committee.</p>
<p>VII. Yuan Dunli argued that the resolutions of the committee should be approved by the Minister of Education and separately handed over to the standing committee members, physical education supervisors, and the responsible departments to implement, and there is no need to set up a special physical education section.</p>
<p>VIII. Gu Shusen argued that the committee should only be responsible for design and not兼管administrative duties. Administrative duties should be handled by a section.</p>
<p>1. Hao Gengsheng, Chen Jianai, Shao Rugan, Liu Shenzhan, Sun Mingxiu, Du Longyuan, Jin Zhaojun, and Su Jingyou successively expressed their opinions, either advocating for or against the establishment of a section. Shao Rugan, who advocated for the establishment of a section, said that since there is a design committee to guide and supervisors, there should also be a section established for the implementation aspect. Du Longyuan, who did not advocate for the establishment of a section, said that there are already standing committee members in the committee who can兼管 administrative duties. Physical education administration in the Ministry of Education should belong to various departments and should not be established as a section to handle it.</p>
<p>X. Chairman Chu put to a vote whether to "[establish a physical education section outside the physical education committee]". Forty-five people voted in favor of establishing a section, and forty-four people voted against establishing a section. The resolution was passed with those who voted in favor of establishing a section. However, since the difference in votes was very small, the opinions of those who did not agree should also be recorded and submitted to the Ministry of Education for reference.</p>
<p>(III) National Physical Education Administrative System Proposal</p>
<p>This proposal has already been voted on simultaneously with the second proposal. Since the second proposal was established, this proposal should not be established.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Nominating Members to Draft a Declaration <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>(V) Proposal for Declaration Drafting Members</p>
<p>The chairman reported that the preparatory committee had already nominated five people. If everyone does not agree, the general assembly will nominate again.</p>
<p>The nominees by the preparatory committee are: new, old, Chinese, foreign, male, and female (1. Zhou Gan, 2. Xu Zhiyi, 3. Su Jingyou, 4. Xie Siyan, 5. Huang Liming). Zhou Gan will convene the general assembly.</p>
<p>The chairman announced that the hour has arrived and extended it by ten minutes, and reported that the group review meeting will continue from 2 to 4 p.m. today, and the fourth general assembly will be held from 4 to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Afternoon Situation of the Fourth General Assembly</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th Telegram: The fourth general assembly was held at 4:20 p.m. on the 19th, with 68 members present. Chairman Chu Minyi continued to discuss the report of the administrative group. The situation is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e98">Discussed the Review Report, the Administrative Organization Passed: Physical Education Funding to Account for 3% of School Funding <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>(I) The physical education funding of each school, in addition to the physical education fees paid by students, should predetermine the budget and set its amount. At least it should account for 5% of the total school funding. 1. Du Longyuan argued that the 5% ratio is abstract and has no basis and should be discussed by the Economic Committee.</p>
<p>Chen Baiqing proposed reducing 5% to 3%, which was seconded by four people. The amendment was established.</p>
<p>Wu Yunrui proposed that universities can be set at 3%, and the percentage of primary and secondary schools should be larger.</p>
<p>Expert Member Ma Liang (Nanjing Guanghua Photo)</p>
<p>Jin Zhaojun opposed it. The chairman put the (3%, amendment to a vote, with 28 people in favor. Then the review proposal (5%) was put to a vote, with 15 people in favor. As a result, (3%) passed by a majority.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Passed: Proposal Regarding Physical Education Equipment <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>According to the review opinion</p>
<p>(II) Regarding the physical education equipment proposals, either retained, transferred to other groups, or merged into the plan, without discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Passed: The National Games to Be Held Every Two Years <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Provinces Take Turns Hosting</p>
<p>(III) The proposal to hold the National Games every two years and take turns in the provinces. Wang Zhengting agreed. The review proposal of every two years saves students' time. The Far Eastern Games are held every four years, which is twice as long. Also, taking turns in the provinces is a very good idea.</p>
<p>Wu Yunrui proposed changing it to once every three years. Chen Jianxi and others seconded the proposal. Jin Zhaojun and Ma Yuehan also said that the meeting period should be two or four years as appropriate.

<h3 id="e119">The Opinion of the Educational Circles in Ping is That the Conference Should Not Be Superstitious About European and American Sports <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th Telegram: The conference received a telegram from 124 people including Yu Xiao and Li Zheng from the educational circles in Ping, which read: We hope that you will not be too superstitious about European, American, and Japanese imported sports methods, but will selectively adopt the good martial arts inherent in our country. The various sports theories advocated by Chairman Chu in recent years, such as advocating that sports should be able to benefit everyone, regardless of gender or age, and should regard exercise as equal to diet, and extremely oppose people who are sports experts and the name of sports experts, and such as saying that the purpose of exercise is only to strengthen the body, so the method of exercise should not take competition and competition, and such as saying that physical education methods must meet the three "no" principles: no money, no effort, and no time, it is easy to popularize and effective. The colleagues firmly believe that these points are the correct theories for those who talk about physical education today and the path and direction that the educational circles in our country must take. We sincerely hope that you will pay attention to this. Taijiquan especially meets the above-mentioned sports principles, and we sincerely hope that it can be decided by your conference to submit it to the Ministry of Education to order all primary and secondary schools in the country to list it as a compulsory physical education course.</p>

<p>On April 1, the 19th year of the Republic of China, the National Games was held in Hangzhou. After the closing ceremony, all the venues were accepted and managed by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, which was the origin of the Zhejiang Provincial Stadium. Later, through Mr. Chen Baiqing's hard work, Zhejiang sports circles began to see a glimmer of dawn, with perfect organization and well-equipped facilities. Regarding the organization of sports meets at all levels, it is divided into four types: provincial, regional, county/city, and school, with the school as the basis and the province as the destination. The county/city sports meet includes primary and secondary school students and amateurs, and is held in groups. The regional is held by gathering schools above the secondary level. The expenses are borne by the schools concerned or the educational authorities of each department. As for the treatment of physical education teachers in middle schools, it is very good, between one and a half yuan and one yuan per hour, and all seek to meet the standards. Now, the Hangzhou Stadium is planning to build a swimming pool to increase public interest, which is jointly run by the province and the city. The funding has been secured and has already begun construction. Swimming is the most suitable exercise, which is of great benefit to public health. Chinese people often ignore it. In most large cities, there is not even one, which is what our sports community cannot compare with other countries. This is one of them. This autumn, the third Zhejiang Provincial Games will be held in Hangzhou. It is said that there will be many new items and new performance styles. At that time, there will be a grand occasion.</p>

However, most members were sweating through their shirts and fanning themselves, but there was no drop of water to be found in front of them. They only stared at the bottles and cups on the chairman's stage, drooling.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Speaking: In order to facilitate the progress of the agenda, the conference placed a small blackboard on the chairman's stage, on which was written: [Each member may not speak for more than five minutes each time, and may not speak more than three times on the same proposal].</p>

<p>Textbooks published by the Commercial Press, including "Basic," "New Era," "New School System," "Modern," "Newly Compiled," and "Newly Written" textbooks for all levels of schools, have been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education and the former University Council. They have long been popular throughout the country. Although the stock of these books was burned due to the national crisis, the Press, with a spirit of redoubled effort, has had its two factories in Ping and Hong Kong rush to print them in full, sufficient to meet the needs of the upcoming school year. The General Office of the Press, after resuming operations, reported all these circumstances to the Ministry of Education. Now it is learned that the Ministry of Education has already approved and commended the Press and issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, as well as the social bureaus of each city, instructing all schools to adopt these textbooks uniformly. The text of the order is recorded below: [According to the report submitted by the Shanghai Commercial Press, stating that they have resumed operations after the catastrophe and have printed sufficient textbooks for all levels, requesting that an order be issued for their adoption, etc., the Ministry has reviewed the report. The Ministry finds that the Press has been diligently engaged in cultural undertakings for a long time and suffered great losses during the recent national crisis, which is deeply regrettable. Now that it has resumed operations and printed sufficient textbooks for all levels that have already been reviewed and approved, the request should be approved. In addition to this instruction, you are to immediately forward this order to all schools, instructing them to adopt these textbooks as usual.]</p>

<p>China to Implement it From September 1</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of all countries requiring a Chinese consular visa for goods shipped to China, the Jianghai Customs Superintendent and the Jianghai Customs Commissioner have officially received an order from the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance to implement this system starting from September 1. The Customs Superintendent and the Customs Commissioner have jointly issued a proclamation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Proclamation by the Jianghai Customs Superintendent and the Customs Commissioner: Regarding the matter of joint proclamation, we have received an order from the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance to issue regulations for the issuance of consular visas for invoices by the consulates of the Republic of China abroad, instructing us to comply with and implement them. Therefore, the said regulations are recorded below. All goods shipped from overseas to China from September 1, 1932, must comply with the provisions of these regulations. The date of shipment of these goods to China shall be based on the date of issuance of the bill of lading related to the goods. This consular visa for the invoice is not intended to replace the original invoice issued by the ordinary merchant. In addition to complying with the regulations to present the consular visa for verification, merchants shall still present the original invoice issued by the merchant to the Customs for verification. Furthermore, the Customs shall not be bound by the prices and other items listed in the consular visa when determining the tax amount. Merchants are hereby notified. Special proclamation. August 18, 1932, Superintendent Tang Hai'an, Acting Customs Commissioner Kedad.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Regulations: Regulations for the Issuance of Consular Visas for Invoices by the Consulates of the Republic of China Abroad. Article 1: From the date of implementation of these regulations, all goods shipped from overseas to China with a value of more than 200 yuan in national currency, except for postal packages and goods exempt from customs duties, must be accompanied by a consular visa for the invoice issued by the Chinese consulate located at or near the place of export. Article 2: The consular visa for the invoice mentioned in the preceding article can be obtained from the nearest consulate of the Republic of China. The merchant must fill in each item clearly and have it signed by the responsible person, and submit it to the Chinese consulate located at or near the place of export for visa. Article 3: The consul shall verify the accuracy of each item filled in the price before issuing a visa. If it is deemed necessary to verify documents or other documents, the merchant shall comply immediately. Article 4: Each set of consular visa for the invoice shall be three copies: one original, which is white; and two copies, which are yellow. The original copy shall be handed over to the merchant by the consulate issuing the consular visa for the invoice and forwarded to the consignee for submission to the Customs for verification. The remaining two copies shall be kept by the consulate, and one copy shall be sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on a monthly basis. Article 5: A handling fee of five gold units of the Customs shall be charged for each consular visa for the invoice and collected at the time of issuance. Article 6: The consular visa fees collected by the consul shall be remitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on a monthly basis along with the copies of the consular visa for the invoice. Article 7: Goods sold to two importing merchants, or loaded on two merchant ships, or imported into two ports, shall not be reported on the same invoice. Article 8: After the goods arrive at the destination, the consignee shall submit the original of the invoice to the Customs for verification at the time of customs declaration. Article 9: For imported goods without a consular visa for the invoice, the consignee shall pay three times the prescribed visa fee as a fine, which shall be used by the Customs to reissue the visa for the invoice before the goods can be released. (A) For goods shipped from overseas on or after September 1, 1932, and reported to the Customs between November and December of the same year without a consular visa for the invoice, the consignee shall pay a visa fee of five gold units of the Customs to the Customs for reissuing the visa for the invoice. (B) For goods shipped from overseas on or after September 1, 1932, and reported to the Customs between November and December of the same year without a consular visa for the invoice, the consignee shall pay twice the above-mentioned visa fee, totaling ten gold units of the Customs, to the Customs for reissuing the visa for the invoice. (C) For goods shipped from overseas on or after January 1, 1932, and reported to the Customs on or after January 1, 1933, without a consular visa for the invoice, the consignee shall pay a fine of fifteen gold units of the Customs to the Customs for reissuing the visa for the invoice, as stipulated in this article of these regulations. (Note:)</p>
<p>The above three items [A], [B], and [C] listed [reporting to Customs for sampling] shall be interpreted as [reporting import] and [reporting storage at the Customs warehouse], and do not refer to reporting transshipment. The date of transshipment of these goods at domestic ports is not relevant to these regulations. Article 10: At the end of each month, the Customs shall list all the consular visas for the invoice collected, together with the amount of fines, and report them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and remit the visas and fines to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance. Article 11: The gold unit of the Customs shall be converted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the exchange rates of the currencies of various countries announced by the Customs, and the consulates shall be ordered to collect fees accordingly.

Article 13: Matters not covered by these regulations may be submitted for amendment at any time. Article 14: These regulations shall come into force on September 1, 1932.</p>
<p>Methods of various countries: After the government announced the implementation of the consular visa for goods system, it was heard that the Japanese Consul had raised objections. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specially went to the consulates of various countries in this port to investigate the implementation methods and fee amounts of this system in various countries. The results obtained are as follows: (A) The countries that adopt the consular visa system are: (1) Spain: For goods imported to China, a visa fee of 12 Spanish national currency units, equivalent to 7 Chinese currency units, is charged per piece. (2) Finland: The current method is to charge US$4.50 per sheet. (3) Italy: Each sheet is charged 10 US gold lire, equivalent to 9.10 Chinese currency units. (4) Czechoslovakia: Each sheet is charged 5/1000 of the price listed on the invoice. (5) The United States: US$2.50 per sheet. (B) The countries that do not adopt the consular visa system are: (1) Germany, (2) Belgium, (3) Denmark, (4) The United Kingdom, (5) Sweden, (6) Switzerland, (7) Holland, (8) Norway.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Japanese Businesses Firmly Oppose Implementation of Foreign Consular-Issued Goods Certificates <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Emergency Meeting to be Held at 1 PM Tomorrow According to Shishi News, after the Customs Superintendent Tang Haian and Customs Commissioner Ketade jointly issued a proclamation yesterday, stipulating that the method of foreign consuls issuing goods certificates will be implemented starting from the first of next month, Japanese commercial groups in this port have scheduled an emergency meeting at 1 PM tomorrow at the Residents' Group in Peng Road to discuss countermeasures. At the same time, they are also conducting liaison with merchants from various countries in Shanghai to confront us collectively. Their letter to fellow friendly foreign merchants has also been drafted and will be issued after textual revisions at tomorrow's emergency meeting. The various news items are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting to be Held The holding of this emergency meeting by Japanese businesses is being coordinated and convened by the merchant associations of various roads and has been scheduled for 1 PM tomorrow in the conference room of the Residents' Group on Peng Road. The main agenda item is to oppose the method of foreign consuls issuing goods certificates announced yesterday by our Customs authorities. In addition to the merchant associations of various roads deciding to request their government to promptly lodge a protest with our foreign affairs authorities, they will also widely solicit the opinions of Japanese businesses for reference. As for other matters to be discussed, there are many important issues, such as [how to respond if the Shanghai Municipal Government refuses to accept the protest lodged by Consul-General Murai regarding the activities of the "Blood Soul Assassination Group," etc.] and [how to remedy the increasingly dire situation of the Sino-Japanese trade.]</p>
<p>Conducting Liaison with Foreign Businesses In terms of trade with China, Great Britain, the United States, Japan, and Germany are all in a superior position. Japanese businesses, recognizing that merchants from various countries in Shanghai have not shown any opposition after our side announced the method of foreign consuls issuing goods certificates, believe that it will be difficult to achieve results if they hold dissenting opinions alone. Therefore, Japanese commercial groups in Shanghai have been conducting liaison with merchants from various countries for days, hoping to conspire against us collectively, and are very active. However, the results of the liaison in recent days show that merchants from various countries are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to cooperate with Japanese businesses to undermine the friendship between the two sides in international trade. However, Japanese businesses are still not at all aware of this and yesterday still sent out many representatives to various foreign commercial organizations in Shanghai to carry out their wooing tactics in order to achieve their goal of uniting and conspiring against us.</p>
<p>Letter to Fellow Friendly Foreign Merchants In addition to dispatching representatives to conduct liaison with various foreign businesses, Japanese businesses in Shanghai are also issuing a letter to fellow friendly foreign merchants. The full text was drafted yesterday, totaling thousands of words, doing their utmost to sow discord. However, the full text still needs to be textually revised at tomorrow's emergency meeting before it can be officially released. However, according to the reporter's inquiry, the content of the full text can be roughly divided into: (1) After the method of foreign consuls issuing goods certificates is implemented, trade with China by various countries will be severely hit. (2) The Chinese government, in order to secretly carry out a plan to exclude foreign goods, has specifically implemented the method of foreign consuls issuing goods certificates. (3) If fellow merchants from friendly countries who are related to trade with China do not oppose the method of foreign consuls issuing goods certificates implemented by the Chinese government this time, it is tantamount to cutting off their own lifeline in trade with China. These are their absurd arguments used as reasons for opposing it.</p>
<p>Reasons for Japanese Businesses' Opposition Since the "September 18th Incident" last year, Japan's foreign trade has plummeted due to the impact of our country's boycott of Japanese goods. In addition, the activities of the "Blood Soul Assassination Group" and the circular issued by the municipal chamber of commerce to various industries refusing to import Japanese raw materials have dealt a fatal blow to Japanese businesses. Although Japanese businesses have tried their best to reduce the cost of various goods, their business has not improved at all. At a time when they are extremely anxious about trade with China, our country has formulated 14 articles on the method of foreign consuls issuing goods certificates, scheduled for implementation, which will result in Japanese businesses having to bear an additional burden of paying eight yuan for the certificate fee for every hundred yuan when shipping goods to China. This will inevitably increase the cost of various goods. At a time when trade with China is becoming increasingly dire, losses will become even greater. Therefore, Japanese businesses will definitely firmly oppose the method of foreign consuls issuing goods certificates formulated by the Ministry of Finance announced by our Customs yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Japanese Military Crossing the Border into the Chinese Concession is of a Temporary Nature <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun Refutes the Japanese Consul's Absurd Claim</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese military crossing the border to demonstrate, the Municipal Government has lodged a serious protest, which has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. However, with respect to the claim made by the Japanese Deputy Consul yesterday that Japanese soldiers passed through Zhongshan Road due to the handover of defense, which was based on an understanding, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, made a statement yesterday stating that when the Japanese military withdrew from Zhabei on May 23, 25 Japanese soldiers each remained at the Toyota Yarn Factory and the Tongwen Academy. At that time, the Japanese handover committee negotiated with our receiving committee that during the period when the Japanese soldiers were temporarily stationed at the Toyota Yarn Factory and the Tongwen Academy, the Japanese military could temporarily pass through Zhongshan Road for the purpose of defense handover and supplying food. Later, the Japanese representative of the Joint Committee reported to the chairman of the committee, who informed our representative. Our representative, upon receiving the report, considered that the Japanese military was withdrawing in stages, and the Japanese soldiers at the Toyota Yarn Factory and the Tongwen Academy had not yet been withdrawn, so this understanding was still needed in reality. Therefore, he did not</p>
<p>Express opposition, but declared to the Joint Committee that this approach should cease once Japan, in accordance with the agreement, withdraws its troops stationed at the Toyota Yarn Factory and the Tongwen Academy. Therefore, the understanding at that time was a temporary measure. Now, the Japanese military at the Tongwen Academy has already withdrawn, and there is no reason for the Japanese military to remain at the Toyota Yarn Factory. Our representative has repeatedly engaged in stern negotiations, and the excuse of the Japanese Deputy Consul is actually a forced interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Unscrupulous Merchants Mail Inferior Piece Goods to Sichuan and Hunan <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Secretly re-packaged inferior piece goods have recently been imported continuously. When loaded onto ships to Shanghai, many of them have already had their lot numbers changed, falsely claiming to be domestic goods and mixing into the market. The Customs Inspection Team has already discovered a batch. Recently, unscrupulous merchants transporting and selling inferior goods upstream of the Yangtze River have come up with an absurd idea. They have secretly hired a large number of workers in a certain foreign warehouse in Hongkou to unpack the renamed inferior goods and repack them into small packages. This work has been going on for many days, in preparation for sneaking them out of the country to various ports in Sichuan and Hunan.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous merchants shipping inferior goods to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River send eight or nine out of ten shipments to Chongqing, Wanxian, Chengdu in Sichuan, and various ports in Hunan Province. Because they believe it is not easy to ship by ship, they have changed their approach. After packing them into small packages, they send them from a certain dock warehouse in Hongkou to the post office as parcel mail to avoid inspection. In this one sentence, six or seven hundred pieces have already been sent out. Now, the unscrupulous merchants have hired more workers to rush to pack and seal the packages day and night and send them in batches.</p>
<p>Shipping is in Sharp Decline Shanghai-Chuan River merchant ships rely entirely on the transportation of piece goods. Recently, after unscrupulous merchants re-branded inferior goods and mailed them through the post office, the export business of Chongqing-bound river ships has been greatly affected. Freight has sharply declined. Taikoo, Jardine, and other upper Yangtze River ships have recently announced a sharp drop in the water freight rates for piece goods from Shanghai to Chongqing in order to attract cargo, reducing the rate from ten taels to eight taels per piece.</p>

<p>Since Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, submitted his resignation, there has been quite a bit of surprise from all sides regarding the selection of Cai Yuanpei, a member of the Central Committee, to succeed him as President of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, Wang repeatedly visited Cai before leaving Shanghai to seek his opinion, but Cai expressed his firm refusal. Now it is learned that Cai, upon receiving an urgent telegram from the Central Government, took the express train to Nanjing at 9:25 yesterday morning.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Negotiations to Revise the Sino-Brazilian Treaty Will Commence <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the revision of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between China and Brazil, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired at the Brazilian Consulate in Shanghai yesterday morning and learned that negotiations could begin soon. However, a spokesman for the consulate stated that although newspapers have reported that Brazilian Ambassador Viloso is about to leave Peiping for Nanjing, the consulate has not yet received such a report. Therefore, it is still unknown when Viloso will go to Nanjing. According to foreign sources, discussions on the Sino-Brazilian treaty revision took place when Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting signed the revised new treaty with Belgium and other countries in 1928. At that time, the Brazilian government expressed great interest and agreed to advance the negotiations before the expiration of the treaty revision period. However, due to many incidents in China,</p>
<p>It was virtually suspended. Now that the treaty period has expired, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has revived the old matter.</p>

It was stipulated at the time that it would be paid off in 29 years from 1912 to 1940. From 1912 to 1914, 62,114.64 Dutch guilders should be repaid each year; in 1915, 72,677.60 Dutch guilders should be repaid; from 1916 to 1931, 76,424.9 Dutch guilders should be repaid each year; from 1932 to 1940, 110,343.65 Dutch guilders should be repaid each year.

<p>Customs Silver 552,947.04 taels.</p>
<p>A resolution can be reached soon According to personnel from the Dutch Consulate in this port, Dutch Minister de Péric has agreed with the Chinese foreign affairs authorities in Nanjing on the details regarding the return of the Dutch Boxer Indemnity. The Shanghai Consulate has not learned of the details. However, according to the reporter's inquiry, it is heard that China and the Netherlands have decided to use the funds to purchase machinery and timber from the Netherlands after the Dutch Boxer Indemnity is returned. Once these conditions are agreed upon, it can be signed.</p>

According to the US authorities' plan to increase the Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, it has been underway since the end of the Shanghai war. Its intention is expected to reduce the need to deploy troops from the Philippines in the event of future emergencies. The New World building has been guarded by Marine Corps troops since the US Army returned to the Philippines on July 1 and has been negotiating a long-term lease. The US Marine Corps has been stationed in Shanghai for five years, and its strength has been two battalions for most of the time, namely the First and Third Battalions.

<p>The business license tax on tobacco and alcohol in Jiangsu Province, originally under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, was once managed independently by the Jiangsu Provincial Government.

The announcement of the Jiangsu Department of Finance is recorded below:</p>
<p>Announcement regarding the Jiangsu Provincial Government order stating that the business license tax on tobacco and alcohol in Jiangsu Province will still be handled by the bureaus under the Ministry of Finance.

<h3 id="e142">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive and Supervisory Committee Resolves to Thoroughly Investigate Zhang Rongchu According to the Law <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Counterfeiting the Trademark of the Printing and Dyeing Company</p>
<p>Conspiring to Obtain Illegal Profits</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee yesterday regarding the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company case. The Executive and Supervisory Committee members Bei Songsun, Wang Yansong, Du Yuesheng, Lao Jingxiu, Fang Jiaobo, Wen Lanting, Ma Jiliang, Zheng Zenan, Lu Wenshao, Jiang Zhigang, Pan Xusheng, Luo Qinghua, Ma Shaoquan, Ye Jiaxing, and others attended. As Chairman Wang Xiaolai went to Sanmen Bay for inspection, Wang Yansong was elected as the temporary chairman, and Secretary Yan Esheng took the minutes. The Commerce Section of the Secretariat reported on the handling and investigation of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company case. After careful discussion, the attendees unanimously resolved as follows: (1) The company's board of directors is responsible for thoroughly investigating Zhang Rongchu, who is highly suspected in this case, and all accomplices according to the law. (2) The goods detained in Xiangtan must be verified by the Chamber of Commerce before being processed. (3) The company should report a detailed list of incoming and outgoing goods to the Chamber of Commerce at any time for investigation.</p>
<p>The Secretariat reported on the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company case. The Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the company on the 28th of this month, stating that they had received letters from cloth merchants in Xiangtan, Hunan, stating that the "San Xingqi Zhigong Biji" and other goods purchased from the company and transported to Xiangtan were detained by the Xiangtan Anti-Japanese Association. They requested a prompt letter of proof and the immediate return of the detained goods. The Chamber of Commerce pointed out that the company was only engaged in printing and dyeing, not spinning and weaving. The key issue was the source of the cloth. When the Chamber of Commerce issued a certificate in the past, it sent personnel to investigate. The company's cloth坯 was contracted from Shenxin Textile Factory all year round, but Shenxin Factory only wove ordinary cloth疋头, not Zhigong or Biji. Moreover, according to the investigation at the time, the factory's annual output was only 60,000疋. In addition, it was claimed that Jianhua Shenji Weaving Factory also had transactions with the company. However, Jianhua was located on Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei and had been shut down since the Shanghai Incident, with no goods to supply. Therefore, external suspicions about the company had been heard from time to time recently. In the spirit of seeking truth from facts, the Chamber of Commerce should ask the company to provide detailed information on the monthly demand for cloth坯 and which cloth factories supplied it, so as to re-verify and certify. After the letter was sent, the company replied on the 29th, stating that the company's cloth坯 was purchased from major yarn factories and foreign firms such as Tianxiang, Jardine Matheson, and Carlowitz. The previous contract with Shenxin did not include Zhigong Biji. The 60,000疋 mentioned were completely printed plain cloth坯, but each疋 was 120 yards long, which was four times the 30 yards of cloth processed and sold by the company. Currently, the company had ordered 42,000疋 of the same cloth坯 from Tianxiang, all 120 yards long. Although less than half had been released due to the cloth surface, the number of 30-yard pieces was also very large. In addition, Jianhua Cloth Factory had a contract with the company to purchase cloth坯, including three types: Zhigong, Biji, and twill. Before the war, it had delivered 72,000疋 of Zhigong (30 yards) and 54,000疋 of Biji (30 yards). At that time, it was approaching the end of the year, and the market was declining, so the company stacked the cloth坯 completely after processing. It only started to move slightly this spring. The cost of Zhigong呢 shipped to Xiangtan was about 9 taels, but it was now selling for only 6 taels and 7 qian 5 fen. They felt heartbroken to sell at a loss, but unexpectedly, it was still seized by the Anti-Japanese Association in Xiangtan. They requested an immediate telegram to release the goods and to inform the Xiangtan Chamber of Commerce for certification. The letter also pointed out that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce could not protect industry, accusing them of convicting people based on suspicion. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce still believed that it could not be easily certified without a thorough investigation. The Chamber of Commerce immediately instructed the Commerce Section to investigate secretly. On August 4, the Chamber of Commerce received another letter from the company, attaching a copy of the date of purchase, sales, product name, and quantity list, requesting verification and certification. It was approved and transferred to the Commerce Section for joint investigation.</p>
<p>Standing Committee: Due to the importance of the matter, the Chamber of Commerce submitted it to the seventh meeting of the Standing Committee on the 11th of this month. Those present that day included Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Bei Songsun, Lu Wenshao, four standing committee members, Chen Zheqing, Luo Qinghua, two directors, and Yan Esheng, the secretary. Chairman Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting. After discussion, it was decided that the case would be handed over to the Commerce Section for a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. At the eighth Standing Committee meeting on the 18th, the Commerce Section had completed its investigation of the case and reported the investigation results in detail. Those present that day included Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Bei Songsun, Yu Zuoting, Lu Wenshao, five standing committee members, Chen Wuqing, Luo Qinghua, two directors, and Yan Esheng, the secretary. After discussion, three opinions were formulated and a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee was convened today to discuss them.</p>
<p>Zhou Yanqing Case: Regarding the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company's own report that its employee Zhou Yanqing had set up an organization to mix Japanese goods with the company's products, all letters are as follows: (1) The Printing and Dyeing Company sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on August 8, stating: "Respectfully, due to frequent misunderstandings about our factory's products in foreign locations, we sincerely request your association to send personnel to investigate and provide re-certification to facilitate the circulation of national goods. We have dared to stomach the violation and are waiting for instructions. However, the outside world is unaware and rumors are rampant. It is even rumored that our company is repackaging and selling enemy goods under false pretenses. Such misinterpretations will inevitably increase your association's doubts. We will truthfully detail the facts of the rumors below. Previously, our company's canvasser, Zhou Yanqing, set up an organization on Pingliang Road in July to transform enemy goods into our company's trademarks and sell them in the market. Fortunately, the Yulin Road Police Station cracked down on the transformation organization and immediately notified our company to investigate. Our company sent personnel to the police station and found that the seized trademarks were 80% our company's. Therefore, our company filed a case for arrest. Later, because Zhou Yanqing's elderly father, over seventy years old, led his daughter-in-law and his grandchildren to beg our company bitterly, our company temporarily proposed at the 63rd emergency meeting of the board of directors whether the case should be pursued. After the board of directors decided to consider their poverty and pity them, they did not pursue the matter and dismissed the employee, and he wrote a letter of repentance. They gave up the right to appeal. However, the outside world does not know the truth and misinterprets this matter, fearing that it will confuse the wise. We have submitted the circumstances and a photograph of the original repentant for your review. Sincerely, Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Co., Ltd." (2) Attached is a video of Zhou Yanqing's letter of repentance: "Letter of repentance from Zhou Yanqing. I know that I was blinded by profit and dared to set up an organization on Pingliang Road to counterfeit your company's trademarks and transform Japanese goods to pass off as your company's products. I was investigated and arrested by the Yulin Road Police Station. Yanqing's illegal behavior is punishable, but due to a momentary mistake, I vow not to engage in trademark infringement again in the future. I beg your company to be extra merciful, considering my first offense, and give me a chance to reform. I will repay you with gratitude. Fearing that my words are unfounded, I am writing this letter of repentance for the record. Respectfully, Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, July 28, 1932, letter of repentance Zhou Yanqing (signed)." (3) The Printing and Dyeing Company's Board of Directors sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on August 16, stating: "Respectfully, recently, there have been many criticisms of our company's products. Your association has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth and has shown commendable patriotism and support for commerce. We believe that there is a reason for rumors. Therefore, on August 8, we detailed the case of our runner, Zhou Yanqing, fraudulently selling British company and our company's trademarks outside, which was discovered by the police station. We immediately convened the 63rd board of directors meeting and decided to dismiss him. Because of his poverty, we did not pursue the matter and only asked Zhou Yanqing to write a letter of repentance. However, the outside world does not understand the content, and rumors continue to circulate. On August 12, we convened an emergency board of directors meeting, and all members agreed that the employee's fraud of using the company's trademark for personal gain and corruption was a serious matter, and only dismissing him was too lenient. We should still instruct the general manager to pursue the matter according to the law and thoroughly investigate the accomplices. On one hand, the supervisory committee should thoroughly investigate the company's business accounts to clarify the facts. The results of the review showed that all incoming and outgoing goods, as well as cloth坯 and printed cloth stored in the factory and warehouse, were clearly recorded and there was no mixing of enemy goods. Since your association sent personnel to investigate this case, it has been more than ten days and the truth should not be difficult to reveal. However, since the investigation, the case has been pending and all business has been suspended. Our board of directors and colleagues have painstakingly founded the Printing and Dyeing Company, originally to resist imported goods. We have never asked ourselves to be behind others in patriotism. How could we knowingly sell enemy goods? Moreover, the company's accounts must be audited by an accountant and reported to the shareholders' meeting. It is not allowed to operate enemy goods in addition to its own business. It is clear that this is not allowed by the circumstances. However, the company's organization of the board of directors only holds a supervisory position and does not bear actual executive responsibility, which has led to corrupt employees colluding and engaging in malpractice. This is truly intolerable by our association and deeply hated by all shareholders of our company. We are now pursuing the matter according to the law, and we will not tolerate any accomplices. We respectfully ask your association to uphold justice, adhere to the original intention of patriotism and support for commerce, and consider the national goods industry. We hereby announce the actual situation to all parties to clarify the facts and stop the rumors. We are deeply grateful. Sincerely, Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company Board of Directors."</p>
<p>Commerce Section Report: Upon receiving the order to investigate whether the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company's products had been modified or counterfeited, we proceeded to conduct a detailed investigation. First, we inquired with the company about its organization, printing and dyeing procedures, and sales situation, and reviewed its books and verified its goods. Then, we investigated with the customer help line to find out how the goods were transacted with the company. The investigation results are listed below: (1) Regarding the company, on the 3rd of this month, together with Zhu and Li of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, we went to the company's factory in Gaolang Bridge to investigate. The factory director, Mr. Wu, guided us to visit the machine room, workshop, and other places. It was divided into two departments, printing and dyeing, and the scale was quite large. There were more than 900 workers day and night, and a textile factory was under construction. It was said that all the cloth坯 in stock were ordered from Tianxiang, Jardine Matheson, Carlowitz, Shenxin, etc. We then cut six pieces of sample cloth, and the factory stamped each piece. After carefully examining the factory, no clues could be found. Then, we went to the company's distribution office, where we were met by the general manager, Zhang Rongchu. I asked him to read the account books, but due to the late hour, I did not have time to read them in detail. The company sent a page of clear accounts to the association, including the number of incoming and outgoing goods and inventory. The next day, we were ordered to extract 16 books from the company (including two copies of incoming ticket receipts, three copies of sales books, three copies of incoming books, two copies of silver books, two copies of silver rolling books, one copy of incoming goods book, and three copies of wholesale books). The next day, we went to extract the bank and money house transaction records. It was said that because the matter was important, we were asked to send someone to the company to review them. On the 8th of this month, we went to the company to extract eight customer account books and brought them back for joint review. After reviewing the company's incoming and outgoing goods accounts from September last year, we found that they were purchased from eight companies including Tianxiang. Except for Jianhua, whose factory had been destroyed and could not be investigated, after checking with Tianxiang, Jardine Matheson, Carlowitz, and Daqingfengda, they were all in compliance. Some of Shenxin's factory was handled by brokers and could not be verified. According to named and unnamed confidential reports, the factory's large flower wool silk cloth was changed in appearance. A letter was sent requesting to go to the factory to see him print it out. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, we went to the factory and witnessed the factory workers printing a piece of flower cloth. The pattern and color were consistent with the sample from the confidential informant. There were a total of four of these patterns, and their copper roller numbers were 569, 563, 564, and 600. It was said that when the factory was opened, it originally used Japanese branch teachers. Since the Shenyang Incident, all the Japanese workers resigned one after another and were replaced by 13 Chinese people hired from the Lun Chang Company. Their skills were exquisite and superior to the Japanese, and their products were novel, which led to external doubts. (2) Information obtained from various parties: After investigating the company's internal affairs and reviewing various accounts, we found no traces of inferior goods being modified or counterfeited. Therefore, we changed our approach to investigating the customer help line that had dealings with the company, inspected the incoming goods book, and ordered a copy of the incoming goods account and the silver payment account. We found inconsistencies between the company's outgoing goods account and the silver receipt account. The quantity recorded on the incoming goods account and the silver payment account of each number was greater than the quantity recorded on the company's outgoing goods book. Even some customer homes did not have a transaction account name in the company's account, but later the customer's family actually had a record of receiving more than 50 boxes from the company. Only five investigations had exceeded 295 boxes and 2,240疋. Although the company's general manager, Zhang Rongchu, claimed that (1) because the silver period had not arrived and there were returns, the account had not been entered, (2) because brokers transferred the goods, the customer's name was not registered, but after investigation, first, most of the goods from each number had been paid for and receipts had been obtained; second, the customer's book registration was under the name of Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company or Shanghai Factory, and there was no mention of anyone transferring the goods. This shows that Zhang Rongchu's words are not credible. Based on the above situation, it is proved that someone used the company's name and trademark to modify and counterfeit goods outside, hoping to obtain illegal profits, which is beyond doubt. Later, because of its organized actions and ingenious design, it was not easy to detect, which caused the customers who traded with the company to be blinded. Now, after investigation, it is naturally impossible to hide it. What should be studied at present is who is exercising the modification and counterfeiting, and who is responsible. The company's letter on August 8 stated that a runner, Zhou Yanqing, had set up an organization on Pingliang Road in July to transform enemy goods into the company's trademark and sell them in the market. The Yulin Road Police Station cracked down on it, and later, because of considering his poverty, he was not investigated deeply and only suspended his job and wrote a letter of repentance. However, the most that a runner can do is to steal the company's trademark. It is impossible to use the company's name. Now, it has been found that the floating goods are sold to each number under the company's name. This kind of organized behavior cannot be accomplished by a runner alone. According to Zhang Rongchu, Zhou Yanqing transformed the company's and Lun Chang Company's trademarks on Pingliang Road and was searched by the police station for more than 70疋. Zhou Yanqing compensated Lun Chang Company 5,000 yuan, etc. The company's letter also said that considering his poverty, he was not investigated deeply. How could a poor person be able to pay a fine of 5,000 yuan? This proves that Zhou Yanqing's counterfeiting of goods has someone else in charge. After this association discovered it, the company's general manager, Zhang Rongchu, did not deny the excess quantity in each number's incoming goods payment account, but only used untruthful excuses to try to cover it up. Therefore, Zhang Rongchu is highly suspected in this case. See the company's board of directors' letter on August 16, which vaguely states that the board of directors only has a supervisory position and does not bear actual executive responsibility, etc. Then, Zhang Rongchu, as the general manager, is in charge of the overall situation. What is his responsibility? It is also impossible to escape responsibility. The company's board of directors' letter stated that the company's accounts must be audited by an accountant and reported to the shareholders' meeting. It is not allowed to operate enemy goods in addition to its own business. After investigating the company, the general ledger for the first half of the year was indeed audited and stamped by an accountant. What they said is still true. Moreover, in the world, employees never give their gains to the public. Therefore, it is credible that the external modification and counterfeiting were not known in advance by the shareholders and board of directors of the company's main body. However, the user embezzled the company's name and engaged in corruption and malpractice, which violated the law. The letter also said that the matter is now being pursued according to the law, and all accomplices will not be tolerated. In order to implement the purpose of resisting goods and safeguard the legal interests of members, it seems that the company's board of directors should be responsible for thoroughly investigating Zhang Rongchu, who is highly suspected in this case, and all accomplices according to the law. The above sections are all factual investigations. Please review them and submit them to the Standing Committee for a ruling.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram Pays Attention to Fictitious Factory Numbers and Trademarks <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Send Personnel to Check Goods Upon Arrival</p>
<p>Detain Goods if Suspected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a special telegram yesterday due to the recent frequent occurrence of fictitious factory numbers and trademarks being used to transport and sell goods. The telegram stated: "To all national public organizations, our association has carefully examined the opinions of merchants and believes that the means used by unscrupulous merchants are nothing more than two: one is to send yarn and cloth to the factory for dyeing, because inferior yarn cannot be distinguished after dyeing; the other is to change the appearance, or falsely create domestic factory numbers, or imitate domestic trademarks, so as to confuse the goods. Therefore, even if they are inferior goods, they are sold in various places and are not easily detected for a while. Our association has previously decided to inform the dyeing factory by letter that it must not cut off the machine head during dyeing, which makes it difficult to identify, in order to prevent fraud. In addition, how to check and prevent fraud is still under discussion. As for the level of fictitious factory numbers and trademarks, we should ask your organizations to send personnel to check the goods upon arrival in the territory. If the brand number and trademark have never been sold or seen in your place before, you should immediately detain the goods in a public place and send a telegram to our association to inquire about the actual situation before releasing them, so as to be prudent and avoid malpractice. Signed, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Last Year's Chinese Overseas Trade</p>
<p>Overseas trade is of great importance, reflecting national strength and public sentiment, and cannot be ignored by those who discuss politics, economics, the nation, and society. Our country has consistently experienced a trade deficit, and people have been advocating for the promotion of domestic goods as a fundamental national strategy. However, the government lacks concrete plans, and the people lack unified organization. Empty talk is of no help. Let us examine the statistical figures of overseas trade. How can one not be alarmed and urgently seek improvement? Overseas trade must pass through customs, so the truth of overseas trade can be reliably discerned from customs statistics. This newspaper has specially consulted customs inspection reports, excerpting the most important aspects and presenting them here, so that the people can be vigilant.</p>
<p>The total value of foreign trade in the 20th year of the Republic of China, calculated in terms of silver, amounted to 234,300,000 Kuping taels. Broken down, imports were worth 143,400,000 taels, and exports were worth 90,900,000 taels, resulting in a trade deficit of 52,500,000 taels. Compared to the 19th year of the Republic of China, with imports of 131,000,000 taels and exports of 89,500,000 taels, resulting in a trade deficit of 41,500,000 taels, and the 18th year of the Republic of China, with imports of 126,600,000 taels and exports of 100,150,000 taels, resulting in a trade deficit of 15,100,000 taels, the situation is even worse. However, when calculated in US dollars, due to the rising gold price, the import value of 810,000,000 US dollars in the 18th year of the Republic of China and 603,000,000 US dollars in the 19th year of the Republic of China was only worth 488,800,000 US dollars in the 20th year.</p>
<p>Looking at imports and exports separately (in units of thousands of taels), in the 20th year, the most imports came from the United States, totaling 32,026,600 Kuping taels, followed by Japan with 29,038,600 taels, then Hong Kong with 21,817,000 taels, and then the United Kingdom with 11,934,400 taels. Compared to the 19th year, imports from the United States increased by 9,861,300 taels, imports from Japan decreased by 3,191,700 taels, imports from Hong Kong increased by 6,747,000 taels, and imports from the United Kingdom increased by 1,222,600 taels.</p>
<p>In the 20th year, the most exports went to Japan, valued at 26,495,600 Kuping taels, followed by Hong Kong with 14,831,200 taels, then the United States with 12,020,050 taels, and then the United Kingdom with 6,452,600 taels. Compared to the 19th year, exports to Japan increased by 4,840,100 taels, exports to Hong Kong decreased by 9,700,600 taels, exports to the United States decreased by 1,167,500 taels, and exports to the United Kingdom increased by 185,700 taels.</p>
<p>Chinese overseas trade extends across the globe, not just to the four places listed above. These four places are listed because their import and export volumes are the largest in value. In terms of trade surplus and deficit, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the countries with a trade surplus were Siam with 168,000 taels, the Dutch East Indies with 7,526,000 taels, Persia and Egypt with 21,200,800 taels, Denmark with 2,311,000 taels, the Netherlands with 36,035,000 taels, France with 12,691,000 taels, Soviet Russia with 30,092,000 taels, and Korea with 195,000 taels. The countries with a trade deficit were the United States with 20,006,100 taels, Japan with 25,430,000 taels, Hong Kong with 69,858,000 taels, Macau with 888,000 taels, Annam with 8,970,000 taels, the Dutch East Indies with 41,214,000 taels, India with 66,871,000 taels, the United Kingdom with 54,818,000 taels, Norway with 1,490,000 taels, Sweden with 4,076,000 taels, Germany with 60,030,000 taels, Belgium with 26,185,000 taels, Switzerland with 4,124,000 taels, Italy with 10,637,000 taels, Canada with 18,836,000 taels, Cuba with 426,000 taels, South Australia with 59,544,000 taels, and other countries with 4,543,000 taels, totaling 524,013,000 taels (the previous table was in millions, hence the value of 525,000,000).</p>
<p>In conclusion, China's overseas trade is primarily with the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Based on the situation in the 20th year, Japan's imports declined due to the boycott, with goods like yarn, cloth, sugar, coal, and seafood being hit. India fell to fourth place due to reduced rice imports of 8 million piculs. As for Germany, woolen goods, chemical industry products, steel, and paper all flourished. The United States saw a surge in exports of agricultural surpluses, such as cotton and wheat, with tobacco, timber, and gasoline also being significant. South Australia's main import was wheat.</p>
<p>The largest export was raw silk, sold to Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, India, and other places. In the 20th year, 32,719 bales were sold to Japan, 29,741 bales to the United States, 18,805 bales to France, and 9,525 bales to India. The largest market for tea was Russia, with 240,824 bales sold, while Egypt, Turkey, and other places also accounted for 162,392 bales, with the United Kingdom and the United States taking far less. Soybeans were sold to Russia, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and other places, with 15 million piculs sold to Russia, 11 million piculs to Japan, 6 million piculs to the Netherlands, and 3 million piculs to the United Kingdom. The import trade situation in the 20th year of the Republic of China underwent even more changes than in previous years, making it difficult to exhaustively describe. This was due to the sharp drop in silver prices, unstable exchange rates, reduced purchasing power among the Chinese people, the boycott of Japanese goods, increased import taxes, overproduction in various countries, and reduced global demand. These factors led to increased competition for sales in China, resulting in falling prices. Chinese exports also fell due to the principle of import and export offsetting each other. Although exports increased relatively in the 20th year, imports still increased by 12.4 million compared to the 19th year.</p>
<p>The increase in imports and exports in the 20th year compared to the 19th year was largely due to the relationship between the value of gold and silver. Therefore, imports calculated in US dollars were actually nearly 200 million less than in the 19th year, as mentioned above. Furthermore, the majority of imports were surplus products from foreign countries. The following is a detailed list of the statistics for major imported goods over the past three years:</p>
<p>18th Year 19th Year 20th Year</p>
<p>(Thousands of Kuping Taels)</p>
<p>Cotton 91,124 132,266 179,082</p>
<p>Cotton Textiles 188,574 149,839 121,078</p>
<p>Wheat 12,421 12,831 87,639</p>
<p>Sugar 98,761 86,391 85,889</p>
<p>Minerals 70,855 75,881 85,123</p>
<p>Machine Oil/Gasoline 64,779 65,045 79,757</p>
<p>Rice 58,981 121,234 64,376</p>
<p>Tobacco 49,162 58,373 62,681</p>
<p>Chemicals 34,255 46,905 48,713</p>
<p>Paper 34,246 37,384 45,405</p>
<p>Machinery 29,887 44,283 43,605</p>
<p>Paints 33,192 25,765 39,441</p>
<p>Timber 27,819 23,178 34,685</p>
<p>Woolen Textiles 44,431 24,616 32,564</p>
<p>Flour 64,008 31,926 30,920</p>
<p>As seen from the above, imports have varied over the past three years. Machinery and machine oil are not produced domestically, so there is nothing to say. However, cotton, wheat, timber, and other items are mostly imported, even though our country is known as an agricultural nation. Furthermore, although the Chinese people have not ceased to research, study, and establish factories to manufacture chemicals, paints, and sugar, the comparison over the past three years shows that the import value has relatively increased due to the rise in gold prices. This demonstrates that the effectiveness of domestic goods is still limited. Given China's current poverty and the constant occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, yet each year there is a trade deficit of 400 to 500 million, the enormity of this amount over decades can be seen. If the Chinese people do not have the capacity to bear this burden, they will inevitably go bankrupt due to accumulation. At this time of increasing foreign aggression and efforts to survive, how should readers be inspired to seek salvation after seeing these few lines of statistics? This places a great responsibility on the Chinese people.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Heavy Rain Again in Our City Yesterday <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been extremely hot, leading to an increase in epidemics among the citizens, spreading most rapidly in the Wusong area. This is likely due to the prolonged drought. Over the past two days, the weather has been even more stifling, with the Fahrenheit thermometer reaching over 98 degrees. Even sitting still indoors, one feels perspiration pouring out, making one feel intoxicated. Yesterday afternoon, around 4:15, the temperature suddenly changed, and dark clouds gathered instantly, making it as dark as night. Soon after, lightning flashed, thunder roared, and torrential rain poured down, lasting for about an hour before slightly subsiding. The thunder and lightning also stopped, and a cool breeze followed, refreshing the mind. In areas with lower elevations in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads, such as Jessfield Road, Avenue Haig, Robison Road, and in the French Concession such as Rue du Marche, West Xinqiao, Rue de Consulat, and in the English Concession such as Foochow Road, Hankow Road, and Shantung Road, pedestrians were ankle-deep in water. The roads in Zhabei and the Nanshi area were also turned into swamps. The areas around the South Railway Station and the 16 Prefectures, being low-lying, experienced accumulated water forming channels due to insufficient drainage. Areas such as Gonghe Xin Road, Qujiang Road, near the Zha Bei dry bridge, Maigen Road Station, and Jiaotong Road were completely flooded. Commuters relied on rickshaws for transportation, causing rickshaw prices to skyrocket, with some fares reaching three to four jiao for very short distances. Some houses with lower elevations were flooded. This was the first heavy rain after the beginning of autumn. However, the wind stopped and the weather turned hot again in the evening, with occasional flashes of lightning, leading to more rain, though not as heavy. By 11:00 PM, it gradually thinned out and then stopped completely. This morning around 3:00 AM, the autumn breeze was cool, and those wearing only thin clothing felt slightly chilled.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Three Master Swindlers Set Up Eight Bogus Companies <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Each Used Several Aliases</p>
<p>Fraudulently Signed Bad Checks</p>
<p>Defrauded Many Goods</p>
<p>Those Defrauded Can Report</p>
<p>Recently, a swindler surnamed Zhu, using five aliases: Jintang, Wenbin, Wenquan, Jianqiu, and Dajun, and his accomplice surnamed Chen, also using aliases such as Yongbao, Ronghui, Yu Chenbin, etc., colluded with Zhang Boqing to set up eight bogus foreign firms in various locations. Their addresses and registered numbers are as follows: (1) Baili Foreign Firm, 36 Sijing Road; (2) Shenhe Foreign Firm, Avenue Edward VII; (3) Weilu Foreign Firm, Sijing Road; (4) Changxin Tobacco Company, 451 North Jiangxi Road; (5) Jianfu Foreign Firm; (6) Jingchang Foreign Firm; (7) Hongdachang Company, 237 Yanging Lane, Xiamen Road; (8) Tongchangfeng Company, Yongan Street. Using very small amounts of money, they opened accounts at the American, Jin Cheng, Ken Yeh, and Hua Tong banks to obtain checkbooks and fraudulently obtained goods from various Chinese and foreign commercial firms and companies, which they then sold and divided the profits. This was recently exposed, and the General Inspectorate of Police was notified. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Zhu and his two accomplices. Upon initial investigation, it was found that eleven businesses, including the Daguangming Electrical Material Store on Ningbo Road, had been defrauded, with losses totaling about 2,000 gold. It is believed that there are more victims. Yesterday morning, the three master swindlers were handed over to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Liu conducted a preliminary hearing and ordered them to be detained for further investigation and a subsequent hearing. Those who have been defrauded but have not yet reported the case can directly submit a report to the police, truthfully stating the amount and type of loss, to be included in the investigation and punishment.</p>

<p>Martyr Teng Jiushou sacrificed himself in Wusong during the January 28th Incident, leaving his family in dire straits. Although various sectors have provided some financial assistance, it is merely a drop in the bucket. Now, the executive committee members of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association in Aparri, Philippines, namely Xian Zong, and the committee members Cai Youbi and Huang Shian, have remitted 200 yuan through the China Xing Bank as a consolation payment. They also sent a letter to the martyr's wife, Ms. Yang Peiyao, entrusted to this newspaper for delivery. At this time of deepening national crisis, supporting the deceased is a way to encourage the living. It is hoped that all compatriots across the country will emulate the patriotic spirit of the overseas Chinese in Aparri, so that the future of our country may not be hopeless.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Workers at the Sanyou Factory Continued Their Hunger Strike Yesterday <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Various Parties Sent Representatives to Offer Condolences</p>
<p>Food Allowances Were Still Not Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The General Labor Union Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>After twenty-three workers, including Hong Jiaben, at the main factory of the Sanyou Industrial Company in Yinxianggang began their hunger strike the day before, the crying for help delegation continued to run around and appeal to various parties yesterday. The workers' food allowances have still not been received. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Continued Hunger Strike After twenty-three workers, including Hong Jiaben, at the Sanyou Factory began their hunger strike the day before yesterday, they remained lying in the factory's low-quality gauze rooms yesterday. Having not consumed a grain of rice or a drop of water for over a day and night, they were extremely exhausted. In order to protect the workers' lives, the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Labor Union repeatedly urged them to eat. However, all the workers continued their hunger strike from morning till night yesterday.</p>
<p>Condolences from Various Parties After the workers at the Sanyou Factory began their hunger strike, various parties were moved upon hearing the news. Those who visited to offer condolences yesterday included representatives from the First District Shipbuilding Labor Union, the Steamboat Woodworking Labor Union, Ye Xianggao, the Electricity Company Labor Union, Wang Han, the Road Industry Labor Union, Ren Jieting, Chen Hanzhang, the Postal Workers Labor Union, Cao Chongye, the Steamboat Stewards Labor Union, Ye Gonglun, the Mercerizing and Dyeing Industry Labor Union, Liu Jintai, Lu Muqin, the Sixth District Water and Electricity Labor Union, Li Yongxiang, and the Municipal Party Headquarters also sent Committee Member Lu Jingshi to offer condolences. The representatives brought various foods such as fruits and milk and urged the workers to eat, but the workers remained determined and refused to eat. Later, doctors determined that Hong Jiaben, Zhang Zegang, Shen Yucheng, and three others were showing signs of illness and needed immediate treatment. The Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Labor Union was immediately notified to transport the three to the Shanghai West Labor Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Petition to the General Committee On the matter of the hunger strike by the workers at the Sanyou Factory, General Labor Union Committee members Zhu Xuefan, Shao Xubai, Yu Xianting, and Li Mengnan went to the Municipal Government to petition at 10:00 AM yesterday. Secretary-General Yu received them, and the representatives presented three points: (1) Please send a special commissioner from the Municipal Government to be responsible for handling the Sanyou Factory incident immediately; (2) Order the management to resume operations within a limited time; (3) If any unfortunate incidents occur due to the workers' hunger strike, the management should be fully responsible. Secretary-General Yu replied that the first point would be handled immediately, and the second point would be handled according to the three measures previously decided by the Municipal Government, ordering the management to comply. If the management continues to resist, the Municipal Government will have to enforce them strictly. The third point is a legal issue and will be subject to legal sanctions, and the Municipal Government is not in a position to reply. The representatives were satisfied and then departed.</p>
<p>Food Not Issued The workers' temporary food allowance of 120 yuan per day was originally scheduled to be issued every Wednesday. However, over the past two days, representatives from party and government organizations, together with representatives from the labor union, have approached the management for the money, but the management has avoided meeting them, resulting in the money not being received. Yesterday morning, representatives from the labor union, together with Zhou Lianze, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Guilin, a representative from the Bureau of Social Affairs, and Dong Zhihe, a representative from the Public Security Bureau, went to the company again to collect the money. However, the company remained adamant and refused to change its position. Finally, it stated that whether or not a solution was reached, this would be the last payment. If they wanted to receive it, the representatives from the three party, government, and police organizations had to be responsible for signing. The three representatives refused on the spot, so the money was still not received.</p>
<h3 id="e151">British Public Bus Workers Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Indicated Acceptance</p>
<p>The General Assembly Decided to Fight to the Death</p>
<p>The strike by the workers of the British Public Bus Company has now entered its ninth day, and the situation remains serious, with no hope of resolution. Yesterday morning, all the workers went to the Municipal Government to petition. In the afternoon, they held another general assembly and decided to fight to the death. Details are provided below. Petition Yesterday morning, over 200 striking public bus workers, all wearing yellow company uniforms, gathered in Caojiadu, lined up, and marched to the Municipal Government to petition. They arrived at the Municipal Government around 9:00 AM. Due to the large number of people, fearing incidents, the Public Security Bureau dispatched over 20 police officers to maintain order, so the situation was quite good. Representatives Shi Baoshan, Wang Xingmao, Zhang Bolin, Yuan Weixin, Chen Yuting, and five others were selected. As Secretary-General Yu was attending a meeting, Wang Shaozhai, the director of the Second Section of the Municipal Government, received them. The representatives first recounted the circumstances of the strike and requested that the Municipal Government mediate promptly. Director Wang indicated acceptance and promised to convey the message to the mayor and negotiate with the company. The workers lined up and left around noon.</p>
<p>Continued General Assembly After petitioning the Municipal Government yesterday, all the workers convened a general assembly at a location on Bailinan Road, with over 200 people in attendance. The presidium reported on the petition to the Municipal Government, and the crowd expressed their determination to fight to the death. Several important proposals were also discussed, but due to the importance of the matter, they were not announced.</p>
<p>Breaking the Water Tank At 4:00 PM yesterday, a Route 2 bus was passing near Bazilu when it was struck by striking workers with rocks, breaking the water tank. The bus could not continue to operate, and one passenger was injured in the head. The passenger hired a rickshaw to go to the hospital for treatment. Furthermore, a Route 9 bus was driving to the intersection of Pingliang Road in Yangshupu when striking workers threw an empty watermelon filled with fecal liquid into the bus, causing a foul odor to spread. As a result, the number of passengers on all routes has decreased.</p>
<p>Workers' Statement According to a statement issued by the Strike Committee, since the labor unrest occurred, because the company firmly rejected the workers' demands, the public was outraged, and a third party took advantage of the situation, resulting in actions outside the scope of the strike. A thorough investigation is now underway, and a report has been submitted to party and government organizations for investigation. The committee's future actions will be on the right track, waiting for the party and government organizations and various legal entities to uphold justice and mediate to seek a legitimate solution. The committee cannot be held responsible for any actions taken by third parties.</p>

<p>The French Consul-General Respects Mayor Wu's Wishes</p>
<p>The workers of the French Water and Electricity Company in this city previously went on strike due to the company's failure to increase wages and improve benefits. The strike was resolved through mediation by various parties, and work was resumed. However, the company refused to pay wages for the strike period. Representatives of the labor union repeatedly requested assistance from the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government consulted with the French Consul-General on this matter several times. It is reported that the French Consul-General, out of respect for Mayor Wu's wishes, telegraphed the Paris headquarters and obtained permission to pay two days' wages as a supplementary payment. The Municipal Government has already notified the Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Great Alliance for Promoting National Products held its fourth National Products Factory Representatives' Congress at the City General Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The purpose was to support the prohibition of the sale of Yaple light bulbs in Southeast Asia. Chairman Chen Yiting reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the Yaple Electric Factory had been operating diligently and achieved considerable success in promoting overseas sales and reclaiming rights. Unexpectedly, it was subject to the Dutch company Philips' pretext of patent rights and a ban on the sale of glass tube pumping in Southeast Asia. This case is related to the future of national products and has a significant impact. The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss rescue measures, etc. Subsequently, Wang Jie'an, Sun Daosheng, and others expressed their opinions, and then resolutions were immediately passed: (1) To convene a city-wide public organization to form a committee to guarantee overseas trade in national products, and the selection and number of people will be handled by the Great Alliance; (2) To notify the factories belonging to this association to voluntarily refuse to use Philips light bulbs, and to send a letter to the National Electrical Industry Association to pay attention; (3) To telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the Dutch government and to review the company's patent for wave tube pumping. After the case was discussed, it was also resolved: (1) To notify all factories to enthusiastically respond to the call for exhibits from the representative of the Chicago Exposition Preparatory Office for national products and the Shandong National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry; (2) To notify all members to resolutely boycott Japanese goods; (3) To petition the municipal government to protect national products factories; (4) To petition the municipal government to provide relief for the heavy losses suffered by the Sanyou Baoye Society in the Shanghai war.

<p>The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Products Factory Federation, located on Bellows Road, sent a letter stating: "To whom it may concern, the factory association has been organized for six years, and its purpose has always been to revitalize industry and promote national products. It is especially sympathetic to the boycott of enemy goods, and its achievements are obvious and have long been known. Since the September 18th Incident, in view of the violence of Japan and the urgency of national crisis, industry is related to the foundation of the country. Without concerted efforts and the use of domestic raw materials, there is no way to save the country. We have repeatedly sent letters to all member factories to strictly comply with this, and not to buy or sell inferior goods to provide the enemy with supplies. The facts are there and can be reviewed. Unexpectedly, recently, a group calling itself the 'Chinese Skull Punishing Traitors Corps' sent a letter to the association, stating that a certain factory had privately imported enemy goods. For the sake of the reputation of national products, please investigate and punish them quickly, etc. The righteousness is stern, and the enthusiasm for safeguarding national products is evident on paper. The association's duties lie within, and it should conduct a thorough investigation for review. However, the factory mentioned in the letter</p>
<p>only lists the factory name without distinguishing its nature. There are thousands of factories, large and small, in Shanghai, and only over two hundred have joined the association as members. It is difficult to distinguish between factories with the same name but different types. What kind of factory is mentioned in the group's letter? Is it a member of the association? What kind of enemy goods were imported? When and where were they purchased? All of these require detailed investigation. Unfortunately, the letter does not specify any of this, making it impossible to start. However, the association will still conduct a strict investigation of the factories with the same name as those mentioned in the letter among its members, in order to get to the bottom of the matter. On the other hand, it will also universally notify all members to strictly use domestic raw materials. It is also hoped that if patriotic groups have any reports in the future, please</p>
<p>provide accurate evidence to facilitate the investigation. Since the letter has no address, it is impossible to reply. We dare to borrow the newspaper to express our sincere advice and make a solemn statement to our patriotic compatriots, hoping for your clear observation. What is the matter? Shanghai Machinery-Made National Products Factory Federation kowtows and prints."</p>

<p>Knitting Industry: The Shanghai Knitting Industry Association issued an urgent notice to the industry yesterday, stating that since the association resolved last year to implement a boycott of enemy goods, it has been fortunate that all members have understood the righteousness and unanimously implemented it, resulting in considerable achievements. Although it has been more than ten months now, the lost territories of the Northeast have not been recovered, and the bloodstains of Shanghai have not dried. All members should still adhere to their original intentions and insist on not changing. Regarding all raw materials and other auxiliary supplies, they must refuse enemy goods and must not be insincere, lest they disgrace their entire lives. They must know that national hatred is more important than personal hatred, and righteous people must first rectify themselves. All nationals should regard this as their bounden duty. If anyone violates the public agreement and dares to act improperly, the association will fulfill its responsibility to expose them to the public for judgment, regardless of whether they are members or not. All members of the industry, please take note.</p>
<p>Department Store Industry: The Shanghai Department Store Industry Association held its first anti-Japanese goods meeting yesterday. Committee members Song Maoqing, Zhu Kongliang, Zhan Xizhi, Wu Yunqing, Ling Shaoxuan, Chen Qifang, and Hua Minghui attended, and Zhu Kongliang was elected as the temporary chairman.

<h3 id="e157">Letter Requesting that all City Students be Ordered to Wear Western Suits Made of Domestic Materials <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Letter from the National Products Promotion Association to the Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<p>Zhang Qingfa and Zhang Dezai, executive members of the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, deeply regret that students in various schools wear Western suits, the raw materials of which are all imported, resulting in the outflow of rights and interests. The trends followed by the nation originate from what is observed, so they specifically proposed at the 26th regular meeting of the association to send a letter to the Municipal Education Bureau, ordering schools under its jurisdiction to promote national products and wear Western suits made of domestic raw materials, in order to correct perceptions and save the country. The letter is recorded as follows: (Omitted above) The association's 12th session, 26th regular meeting, Executive Member Zhang Qingfa and Executive Member Zhang Dezai proposed that a letter be sent to the Municipal Education Bureau to strictly order students in schools under its jurisdiction to wear clothing made of domestic materials. The matter was resolved to be handled as proposed and recorded. Shanghai is the center of national morality. The clothing of students above junior high school is mostly Western suits, and the clothing materials are all foreign goods. The loss of rights and interests is extremely large, hindering the national products movement. Moreover, students are the future masters of the country, and the trends followed by the nation originate from what is observed. The association promotes national products as its duty, and is unable to remain silent out of heartache. Therefore, in accordance with the proposal, a letter is sent to your esteemed bureau director, with the enthusiasm of maintaining national products, to strictly instruct the principals of all schools under your jurisdiction to supervise all students to uniformly wear Western suits made of domestic clothing materials, in order to correct perceptions and save the country. We also request that national universities be advised to do the same. The national economy and people's livelihood deeply depend on it. (Omitted below) We also telegraph the Ministry of Education in the capital to strictly order all schools nationwide to use national products for all needed items, except for those with no substitutes, and to order all students nationwide to wear clothing made of domestic raw materials, in order to demonstrate promotion and reverse the declining trend. (Similar wording omitted)</p>

<h3 id="e162">Disputes over Epidemic Inspection of the Xinfeng Ship <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinfeng ship arrived on the 25th of last month and had a dispute with the seaway quarantine office, which was reported earlier. Later, the quarantine office forced the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to punish the ship's chief mate, Jiang Changqing, which aroused the public anger of all the crew members of the Shanghai merchant ships. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the seaway quarantine office, stating that if the quarantine doctors do not comply with the regulations and quarantine outside the port, and if the doctors do not arrive on the ship at the specified time, then the future disputes will inevitably increase. In the future, all losses of passengers, crew members, and ships caused by this shall be borne by the quarantine office. The original letter was sent out yesterday. The general content is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"To whom it may concern, we received a letter on the 27th of last month with a report in the newspaper. Everything was accurate, but your correction was completely inconsistent. The letter from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's General Manager Li was also not the main cause of the dispute. Chief Mate Jiang Changqing of Xinfeng is a member of this association. This time, he was unexpectedly slandered. Xinfeng arrived at the Jinliyuan Wharf at 8:40 AM on July 25th. Dr. Qi arrived on the ship at 9:10 AM, half an hour later. All the passengers had already disembarked. The correction letter stated that the doctor arrived at the ship at 8:45 AM and was not absent from duty. This statement is completely inaccurate. According to the time Xinfeng arrived at the wharf and the time the medical officer arrived on the ship, as pointed out by the association, are both recorded in the old gram book signed by the shipowner, and stamped and signed by the Maritime Affairs Bureau and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's chief shipowner. Your office wants to use this to cover up the absence from duty, but it is just enough to confirm the matter. Moreover, Xinfeng had hundreds of passengers. How could they all leave the ship in five minutes? Even if your office wants to erase the facts, it is too contradictory. Your office also claimed that Chief Mate Jiang accused the medical officer of causing trouble with the quarantine, so he raised the flag to summon the police to suppress the order. This is a lie. Since the doctor was half an hour late, the passengers had already left and there was no epidemic to examine. It was not necessary for Chief Mate Jiang to point out the trouble. The medical officer rebuked Chief Mate Jiang for not keeping the passengers, and Jiang retorted. The doctor became angry, summoned foreign police to take advantage of the situation to detain the ship, and deliberately harassed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, forcing it to punish Chief Mate Jiang, abusing his power, wantonly threatening, and disrupting security. He did not want to issue a permit and did not allow Xinfeng to clear customs. He made a big fuss. The hidden situation is not worth asking deeply. Fortunately, the Business Bureau tolerated it and did not want to cause trouble, so it apologized to settle the matter. Your office is shameless and arrogant. As for praising the shipowners of various countries, it is especially a matter of unworthy people, who generate themselves outside, pick up other people's spit, to pursue private interests, and promote the West and suppress the Chinese, which has become the heart method of ancestors. I won't discuss the others. Regarding the quarantine of the Nagasaki Maru ship recently, he publicly refused, and the situation was ten times more serious than Xinfeng. However, the doctor was not seen summoning the police to suppress the order, maintaining order, and your office was not seen not issuing a permit because it did not hang the epidemic flag, and detaining the ship. As for the crew members, there was no request for punishment. The so-called praise and obedience of shipowners from various countries is really a decoration of the facade, which is suitable to show its ugliness. Is it true that we should be fair in everything, regardless of Chinese or foreign, and stick to it? Even if this association does not say it, how can the public opinion of society escape? Moreover, there is something else to be said. Unanimity against foreign countries, cooperation in strength, and avoidance of internal strife have always been my wishes. However, according to the general practice in various places, the quarantine of seagoing vessels is carried out outside the port, so as to prevent its spread. Only your office has created a new example, not only carrying it out in the port, but even on the dock. Regardless of whether this</p>
<p>method is stipulated in the regulations, it is ultimately not appropriate in practice, which can be asserted. According to Shanghai port, due to various reasons, navigation is very difficult. The crew members bear the responsibility for the safety of the lives and property of a ship. From the time of entry to the time of stopping, the authority of the driver in terms of driving is absolutely not allowed to be directed by the epidemic doctor again. Therefore, the quarantine of this port, Wusong port, has a specified location where it anchors for inspection, which is also LuarantieAnchorag. For decades, it has been inconvenient to engage in it. Now we have taken back the self-management, and increased the country</p>
<p>international status as the banner, then we should follow the good and follow the progress, and we should not hinder people with difficult methods due to our own inability to strive for progress. If this is not changed for a long time, there will be more places to cause disputes in the future. Such incidents are also related to changing the location. Moreover, your office claims to be handling quarantine in accordance with navigation practices. It is better to be silent, which is not the purpose of a gentleman loving others with virtue, but to see the detachment of right and wrong, and to leave hidden worries for the world and the hearts of people. Moreover, this association has more to declare. In the future, if the quarantine is not carried out outside the port and the doctor's arrival time on the ship is not specified, then all damages to passengers, ships, crew members, etc. caused by</p>

<p>Liu Gao's Mother and Son Were Burned by the Fire</p>
<p>At 1:25 AM this morning, a fire suddenly broke out downstairs in the house of a man named Liu from Changshu in Wenfu</p>
<p>Lane, Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen. Because it was late at night, everyone in the house was asleep, so they did not notice the fire when it started. When the housewife Liu Gao woke up, the fire had already spread. The stairs had already been burned off, so she held her three-year-old son Liu Lindi and went to the window facing the alley. But at that time, the skin of the mother and son had already been burned by the flames. They jumped out of the window in a hurry and fell to the ground unconscious. Fortunately, the fire trucks of the Xiaoximen Second District Fire Brigade had already arrived to rescue them. Seeing this, they immediately transported the injured Liu Gao and her son to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that their injuries are very serious. The fire was also quickly extinguished, and a total of three houses were destroyed.</p>

<p>Joint Announcement by the Public Security and Health Bureaus</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security and Health Bureaus jointly issued an announcement yesterday, saying: "For the purpose of the announcement, it is found that it is the time of the hot summer, and epidemics are easy to occur. Special attention must be paid to personal hygiene in order to maintain physical health. Recently, it has been found that citizens take off their shirts to cool off during the day everywhere, and there are even more people sleeping in the open at night. This habit not only increases the chances of spreading infectious diseases, but also hinders the appearance and has a negative impact on social morality. In addition to the fact that this Public Security Bureau has ordered the police to crack down on it at any time, it is hereby announced and strictly prohibited. I hope you all know."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company, after the end of the Shanghai War, except for the third route [that is, the Zhabei to Zhenru resumed traffic, the rest, such as the Jiangwan first route, was delayed due to the Japanese soldiers stationed here, and the Yokohama Road Bridge in that area was bombed, and the traffic was blocked. After the negotiation by the municipal government, the Japanese soldiers have now withdrawn, and they are actively constructing and repairing the bridge to restore the original state. Yesterday, the company received instructions from the Public Utility Bureau stating that the Public Works Bureau sent a letter stating that the route taken by the first route of the public bus will be completed soon, and vehicles will be allowed to travel back and forth at the end of the month. After receiving the order, the company is preparing to restore traffic to Jiangwan on September 1st. The fare for the entire route remains the same, but the originally set distances for each station are still considered uneven, so it has been specially approved by the authorities to make slight adjustments."</p>

<p>Sentenced to One Year in Prison</p>
<p>Wenzhou woman Weng Linglong, seventeen years old, was abducted two years ago to the Zhang family in Nantang, Qingpu, to be a maid. Later, because she could not bear the abuse, she reported to the Public Security Bureau, which sent her to the relief society for eight months. Later, she met a woman named Song Song, who ran an opium den in the area, and was taken back by Song to raise her. The day before yesterday, Song suddenly ordered a local villager named Ding Tongsheng to bring the girl to Shanghai and send her back to her hometown in Wenzhou. Unexpectedly, Ding had bad intentions. After bringing Weng to Shanghai the day before yesterday, he first took her to see a play at the Wonderland, then helped her get a haircut and bought her a piece of clothing. At about 12:00 PM, he took her to Room 4 of the Zhixin Hotel on Beihai Road, intending to rape her. After the girl refused, she ran out of the hotel door crying. Hua Tan Cui Jinchuan and Hua Bu No. 2772 from the Laozha Police Station saw her, asked about the situation, and arrested Ding and took him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was taken to the First Special Criminal Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him in accordance with Article 257 of the Criminal Code and requested that he be dealt with according to the law.

<p>Shi Zhang, a woman from Rugao, alleges that her son, Shi Sanwangzi, thirteen years old this year, became a copper apprentice at the Huang Bao Car Shop owned by Sun Xingyu, a native of Taixing, located at No. 5 and 6, Lujiabang, Haichao Temple in the South City, in March of this year. Unexpectedly, on the 11th of this month, Shi Sanwangzi suddenly died. Shi Zhang filed a complaint with the local court yesterday, stating that according to her neighbor, Xu Zhongmei, on the 9th of this month, her son ate an apple, which led Sun to tie his hands and feet and use iron chopsticks to pry them, forcing him to confess to theft. Subsequently, he was severely beaten with a car shaft. When the police arrived to intervene, Sun claimed he was punishing his own son, so the police did not interfere. However, the child died from his injuries on the 11th. Sun immediately bribed neighbors Ye Jiu'er and Xiaozhu'er to secretly collect and enshroud the body at 9 PM that night, abandoning the coffin in the eastern part of the Yi Tomb grounds. He even wrote Sun Jinsheng on the coffin, intending to pass him off as his own son to cover up the traces of abuse leading to death. However, the police station refused, so he bribed doctor Yang Yuzhai to forge a medical certificate to register with the household registration at the police station, showing extreme malice. However, a human life is of paramount importance and must be investigated. It is requested that an autopsy be performed after exhumation.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>After reading the daily news columns of your esteemed newspaper on August 17th regarding the import of Japanese paper in July, totaling 1,180+ pieces and occupying the first place, we are providing a summary of the true situation of the foreign paper industry below for inclusion in your letter to the editor column in order to clarify the situation: (1) Before the September 18th Incident, the import of foreign paper into Shanghai was about 20,000 pieces per month, of which Japanese paper accounted for 50%. (2) After the September 18th Incident, the sales of Japanese paper plummeted. The import of 1,180+ pieces of Japanese paper in July is indeed a small number, accounting for less than 10%. The claim that it occupied the first place is a misunderstanding. (3) Most of the aforementioned imported Japanese paper was directly resold to Hankou and Tianjin by Japanese merchants. (4) Sales of foreign paper are still dominated by Western goods. Although there are Japanese merchants running around and unscrupulous individuals selling to various users, the number is extremely small.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We are writing to inform you that the Director of the Security Department of our government is Zeng Zesheng, and the Deputy Director is Luo Jingyou. In the news you published yesterday about Director Luo's resignation, you mistakenly reported Huang Ming as the Director. This is likely based on inaccurate information. Please correct this error.</p>

<p>Your talk about Zhang Sheng crying in The Story of the Eastern Wing is quite amusing.</p>
<p>I don't see it that way. I'm just riffing on The Journey to the West, and riffing on The Story of the Eastern Wing.</p>
<p>The main character in The Story of the Western Wing is Zhang Sheng; the main character in The Story of the Eastern Wing is also Zhang Sheng. That's quite a coincidence. Zhang Sheng's close friend in The Story of the Western Wing is General White Horse; Zhang Sheng's close friend in The Story of the Eastern Wing is General Black Horse. This is another wonderful parallel. Why didn't you mention it?</p>
<p>True, true. Both General White Horse and General Black Horse are Zhang Sheng's close friends, both upright men who stand tall, and they can certainly be compared. However, General White Horse rescues Zhang Sheng, while General Black Horse awaits rescue from Zhang Sheng. General White Horse rescued Zhang Sheng, saving him from danger; General Black Horse awaits rescue from Zhang Sheng, but Zhang Sheng is unable to save General Black Horse from danger. So, General White Horse in The Story of the Western Wing did not let Zhang Sheng down; but Zhang Sheng in The Story of the Eastern Wing has let General Black Horse down a bit. Because there are so many differences, I didn't mention their close friends General White Horse and General Black Horse when I wrote Zhang Sheng Cries.</p>
<p>In your opinion, which is the more difficult situation, General White Horse's or General Black Horse's?</p>
<p>Of course, White Horse's is easier and Black Horse's is more difficult. It's easier to quell Sun Feihu; it's harder to eliminate Dwarf Tiger. However, difficulty reveals ingenuity, and perhaps Dwarf Tiger will fall at the hands of General Black Horse. Let's wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Hitler, the Eccentric Genius of Germany <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Juncao</p>
<p>What I want to talk about here is the leader of the German Beer Hall Putsch, a follower of Fascism, the head of the National Socialist Party, and the modern eccentric who has attracted worldwide attention: Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>In the early winter of 1923, Hitler, with the help of General Erich Ludendorff (Chief of Staff of the German Army during World War I), rashly launched a rebellion in Munich, declaring a revolution. In less than a day, it was put down by the local garrison. Hitler inevitably landed in jail, tasting a year of prison life. At that time, men and women throughout Europe regarded this abortive revolution as a laughing stock. Hitler received only ridicule and scorn. But are temporary successes and failures the most important thing? Look, what is Hitler like today?</p>
<p>The establishment of the National Socialist Party was entirely due to Hitler's personal perseverance. Although it has a long history, it has now become the most powerful political party in Germany. In 1924, the party only had twelve seats in the parliament, but in 1928, it leapt to 107 seats. According to general predictions, this year's general election will likely increase to around 230 seats. The rapid expansion of the National Socialist Party's power is due in part to the outstanding oratory genius and organizational perseverance of its leader, Hitler, and in part to the widespread social unrest in Germany: industrial decline, the burden of reparations, and severe unemployment.</p>
<p>Hitler was born in 1889 in Braunau am Inn, Austria. His father was a railway employee. In his youth, Hitler went to South Africa to participate in the Boer War. At the age of twenty-three, he went to Munich, Germany, and worked as a house painter for several years, without any development. When World War I broke out, he joined the German army and spent four years living in the trenches. After the war, he began his political activities, giving speeches to drinkers in beer halls and cafes, criticizing the government's performance, and expressing his personal political views. He used his oratory genius to attract the attention and excitement of many people.</p>
<p>Hitler has a slender, medium build, a straight nose, high cheekbones, a small mustache, and piercing eyes. His proclaimed policies are to abolish the Treaty of Versailles externally, cancel war reparations, establish a dictatorship internally, and eliminate all potential power of the Jews. His ideal supreme figure is Benito Mussolini. Mussolini's photograph is on his desk. He imitates Mussolini's every move, even imitating Mussolini's salute. He often tells reporters that if Heaven were to give Germany a Mussolini, the Germans would kneel down and worship him.</p>
<p>Hitler recently gave a speech in the suburbs of Berlin: "For the past thirteen years, Germans have been constantly in shackles. In the future, the National Socialist Party will clear out the thirty-odd political parties that cannot have a clear and strong policy, and strive for an opportunity to demonstrate the National Socialist Party's policies and capabilities." Look at how great his ambitions are.</p>

<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>Yesterday, four people dressed in black silk short shirts and trousers, holding account book-like notebooks in their hands, burst into the door with smiling faces, and shouted loudly, without knowing who they were talking to: "This year, Shanghai has been ravaged by the Japanese. So many people died in Zhabei, and the weather is hotter than in previous years, so the plague is severe." Before they finished speaking, they placed the notebooks in front of me. I saw that some people had written one yuan, some two yuan, and even five yuan or ten yuan. I was very surprised. Isn't this a donation? Most of the Shanghai plague hospitals are set up by charitable organizations, and I have never heard of them collecting donations. What is going on? Thinking this, I stared at them with suspicion. One of the short, fat men, noticing my expression, smiled and said: "We also live in this neighborhood. For the peace of the tenants in this neighborhood, we have launched a 'Taiping Gong Jiao' [Taoist ritual for peace]. You can write down however much money you want." After hearing his words, I understood their intention and firmly refused: "I won't donate. Not even a penny. Don't say I don't have money, even if I do, I'm not willing to be the son of monks and Taoists. To pay them a sum of money is like letting them create a ruckus that is as scary as hell and scam away a year's worth of food, clothing, and housing. In fact, many people who spend money on rituals often die from the plague. I really don't see what benefits there are to creating these parasites for society. It would be much more meaningful and beneficial to send the money to the Northeast to buy bullets for the volunteers to kill our enemies."</p>

<p>Recently, my wife has been frequently ill. She was introduced by Mrs. Lin, who believes in taking medicine even when healthy, to famous doctors in Shanghai for treatment. According to her experience, this doctor can indeed work wonders and cure diseases with his medicine. So I accompanied my wife to the doctor's office. We registered for the price of 4.40 yuan. Because we arrived late, our number was 156. We waited from 11:00 AM until 3:00 PM in the afternoon before it was my wife's turn. I watched the doctor examine my wife and was shocked. He put his fingers on my wife's pulse while looking at a stack of other people's prescriptions and reporting the names of the medicine in his mouth. The examination was over in less than five minutes, and someone else filled in the prescription. Another half hour passed before we got the prescription. After returning home, I tore up the prescription and forbade my wife to take his medicine. My reasoning was: it's better to let nature take its course than to become a wronged ghost. Perhaps she won't die; otherwise, you can't be sure.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>One day, I went to visit a wealthy man about a friend's business. While I was waiting for the wealthy man, who was smoking opium upstairs, in his luxurious living room, I caught a glimpse of a servant in the courtyard feeding two large foreign dogs with two large basins of fragrant beef. I became impatient waiting, so I walked into the courtyard to watch the dogs eat beef. I unintentionally asked the servant how much beef these two dogs ate every day. He replied: "At least three yuan worth of beef and 40 cents worth of milk every day." I was stunned. This is truly a wealthy man's extravagance. Just for two dogs, he spends more than one hundred yuan a month. How much better it would be to use that money to help the disaster victims. In my mind's eye, I seemed to see a large group of disaster victims scrambling to eat rotten human flesh.</p>
<h3 id="e187">A New Chemical Industry Worth Introducing <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Pi Man</p>
<p>The dye indigo used for dyeing is made from substances extracted from coal tar oil. Therefore, it is called coal tar oil dye, also known as aniline dye. Aniline is extracted from the coal tar oil, benzol, which is treated with nitric acid, initially transforming into nitrobenzene, and then reduced by light gasification, thus becoming aniline. This is the basic raw material for manufacturing the dye indigo. The term aniline dye is derived from this.</p>
<p>Recently, new leaders in the local dye industry, Li Shuyan, Wang Zuolin, Wu Xingzai, and others, have united with various sectors to launch the Zhongfu Chemical Manufacturing Factory Co., Ltd. with a capital of 1 million yuan. The various initiators have committed to contributing more than 400,000 yuan. The company specializes in the manufacture of the dye indigo. Indigo is made from camphor and acetic acid, etc., extracted from coal tar oil. This is the latest manufacturing method. The company held an inaugural meeting, and publicly elected Qiu Pengnian as the chairman of the fundraising committee. Xu Xinliu, Zou Bingwen, Dong Rongqing, and others were elected as preparation committee members. Dong Rongqing was elected as the director of the preparatory office, with Li Shuyan as his deputy. The registration is currently in progress. Fundraising is expected to begin soon. Mr. Dong graduated from the Chemistry Department of the Pratt Institute of Technology in the United States. He has conducted on-site inspections of major European and American dye factories, and interned at the BASF factory (I.G. Farben) in Germany. He has served as a managing director of the Hangzhou Wulin Paper Mill, a technician at the Shanghai Zhongyi Chemical Factory, and is a member of the Chinese Engineering Society, the Science Society of China, and the American Chemical Society. He has a wealth of experience in practical chemical work. He is also shrewd, capable, and amiable. Many people from all walks of life are supporting him.</p>
<p>The annual value of dye imports into China is more than 100 million yuan. It is a huge outflow of wealth that should be curbed as soon as possible. Moreover, dye factories are closely related to national defense, as they provide chemical warfare weapons. With the daily increase of foreign aggression, it is especially urgent to set them up. This kind of enterprise can not only generate profit, but also defend the country against enemies. When fundraising begins, Chinese citizens will surely invest enthusiastically. It can be predicted. (The company's preparatory office is located at No. 14 Guangdong Road) A pioneering move worthy of my introduction.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Looking at the Studio, Boasting About the Muscles: Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao (Middle) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Qichao, styled Zhuoru, also styled Rengong, was a native of Xinhui, Guangdong. When Youwei lectured at Wanmu Thatched Cottage, Qichao was the most knowledgeable and eloquent. None of the disciples could match him. Youwei compared himself to Confucius and likened Qichao to Yan Yuan, hence his fame. When Li Ruifen presided over the Guangdong provincial examination, he saw Qichao's writing, like the Yangtze River pouring down thousands of miles, and did not dismiss it for its superficiality or brevity, placing it at the top. He looked around and said, "This man's fame and position will surpass mine in the future." He summoned him for an interview and was even more amazed by his talent. Knowing that he was not yet married, he gave his younger sister in marriage. When Ruifen returned to the capital, he praised Qichao greatly among officials and scholars. Everyone in the capital knew of Liang, the recommended scholar, and competed to see him. Qichao had a close friendship with Tan Sitong. Sitong recommended him to Chen Baozhen, the governor of Hunan, and he was put in charge of the Changsha School of Current Affairs. Although he criticized and rejected the Manchus, he advocated reform. Elders such as Wang Yunxuan and Wang Xianqian were shocked to hear this, saying that Qichao's inflammatory words were disrupting politics. However, Baozhen was unmoved, as Baozhen had always sympathized with Kang and Liang. His son, Sanwei, once argued that a strong country must undergo reform. Xu Renduo, the education commissioner, was also a reformer. After befriending Qichao, they often discussed national affairs until late at night. He secretly wrote to his father, Zhijing, stating that Qichao's talent was sufficient for great responsibility and requested that he be recommended to the court. Zhijing was then a vice minister of the Ministry of Rites. One day, Emperor Dezong summoned him and asked about talented people for the new policies. Zhijing recommended Qichao. He received an imperial decree granting him the rank of sixth grade and assigning him to the Translation Bureau of the Printing Office. He was about to be put to great use when the political upheaval occurred. Qichao had already gone to Shanghai for the Current Affairs Newspaper and avoided the disaster. He quickly went to Japan and wrote "A Record of the Hundred Days Reform," criticizing Empress Dowager Cixi and lamenting that Emperor Dezong could not fulfill his ambitions. From then on, he lived in Japan for a long time, editing and publishing the "Qingyi Bao" (Public Opinion Journal) and "Xinmin Congbao" (New Citizen Journal). Because of his fluent writing, almost everyone had a copy. At the end of the Xuantong era, Zheng Xiaoxu, Zhang Sai, Tang Shouqian, and others established the Preparatory Constitutionalism Association, communicating with Qichao. Qichao published the "Guofeng Bao" (National Customs Journal), criticizing relatives of the imperial family for manipulating power and interfering in politics. He also opposed the Tongmenghui. At that time, Zhang Binglin was writing the "Minbao" (People's Journal), and their views differed. He often wrote abusive articles. Qichao did not back down and responded with harsh words. Everyone knew that Qichao liked to argue. After Yuan Shikai entered Beijing from Huan Shang, he intended to seize power. He sent Tang Shaoyi and Yang Shiqi south to negotiate peace and summoned Qichao back. Qichao, who had been dormant for a long time, thought about taking action. Knowing that Yuan Shikai was superior in strategy, he hurriedly set out. From Korea, he passed through Shenyang. Xiong Xiling, the salt transport commissioner of the three eastern provinces, welcomed him outside the city. During their meeting, Qichao said, "Political corruption is based on the blind and reckless actions of the nobility, without the participation of the Han people. We were once loyal to the Emperor and supported the monarchy. Although Emperor Dezong is no longer alive and the young Emperor is ignorant, the regent is dim-witted. The responsibility of those who die later is even greater. Now, many people advocate democracy and republicanism, which is not suitable for the national condition. Even if we talk about republicanism, we should have a constitutional monarchy." Xiling agreed with his words, which were reported to Yuan Shikai. He requested an imperial decree appointing Qichao as the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, urging him to take office quickly. Qichao hesitated and did not go. Yuan Shikai sent his trusted aide to urge him again, and then he left.</p>

<p>The market is mediocre and trending downward. Yesterday, the gold standard market was mediocre but continued to decline. The daily ups and downs only amounted to one or two taels, and the total was only four taels. The cash transactions of various brokers were complex and idle. Finally, it fell more than six taels. It opened below the 720 tael mark. Although the silver market rebounded, it was unmoved. Initially, it was influenced by the opposite rise in U.S. silver futures and private telegrams. Later, it hovered slightly. The foreign exchange market seemed to be clearly flat but secretly loose, and people's hearts seemed soft. In the after-market, sellers were brave, and the trend became weaker. It only reached about 716 taels. The swap market once traded over 900 contracts, and the short side still posted 1 tael and 2 mace, according to Dafengheng Swap and Yuanxingyong, etc. The detailed conditions of the pre- and after-markets are recorded below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trend of the silver standard remained loose, and the silver cent gradually increased. Surprisingly, in two or three days, it suddenly increased by more than two cents, which may not be a good sign of a turnaround in the market sentiment.

<h3 id="e193">Dull Securities, Government Bond Market Conditions <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Ups and Downs Intertwined, Small Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market conditions of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. Spot transactions were still extremely clear. Only the 19 customs opened at 1,000 yuan in the after-market. There was no other market. The futures market was also very deserted, with few transactions. The transaction volume of the pre- and after-markets was only about 800,000. The total was only 1.65 million. As for the trend of various bonds, the current situation is depressing, and the market sentiment is correspondingly cold. All parties are watching and not moving. Even retail investors' entries and exits are very rare. Therefore, the transactions are few, and the supply and demand are very even. The price is stagnant and the fluctuations are very slight. As a result, the entire Sixth Customs Tax and Demobilization continued to be weak compared to the previous day, while others rebounded slightly, with the number only being around two or three jiao.

<p>On Thursday, the New York stock market was rather weak at the opening, but then the price of wheat rose, and people's hearts began to cheer up. Both the industrial and public utility sectors were quite active in selling throughout the day, but the resistance was also strong, so the market did not rise or fall much. Only the railway stocks showed outstanding performance. The trading volume gradually decreased, and there was a trend of returning to normal. According to the report from Pia Shi Lai, the chaotic market within the day seems to be gradually calming down. However, observing the recent selling trend, although it is strong, it can show sufficient resistance, so there should not be a large reaction in the near future.

<p>The cotton yarn market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon. The actual demand from customers is still stagnant. All parties have no activity or vitality. It is probably because the economy is still difficult to be very comfortable, so there is no active purchasing power. Because of the large increase in raw cotton, the futures label yarn market is looking good, and the market price has risen accordingly by one or two taels.</p>
<p>People's Label Up More Than One Taels People's Label opened in the pre-market. With the rise in American cotton, the morale in the market was scattered, and the actual demand was not strong. The price of each month was flat. In the afternoon, it was heard that the cotton business was smooth, and the yarn market rose with it. The price of each month rose by one tael three to four qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 31,750 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 1,600 bales, Dafeng 700 bales, Ruida 600 bales, Changfeng 2,300 bales, Yichang 1,000 bales, and Xingyuan 1,500 bales.

<p>The current cotton is very lacking, with a large possibility of squeezing shorts.</p>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon. The situation is very sharp. There is a large sales volume of current cotton in the market, and the spot goods in August are lacking, and there is a big squeeze, so people's hearts are greatly shaken, and scattered shorts suddenly appear panic, so this month rushed out of the five tael mark, and the far month rushed out of the four tael mark, but a certain manufacturer is still selling and increasing the code, but the buyer's morale is very strong.</p>
<p>Zheng's Label Shorts Are Busy Covering Zheng's Label opened in the pre-market, and the market atmosphere was stable.

<p>Yesterday, there were still many sources from various gangs in Shanghai South, about more than 10 numbers of urban and rural fixed sales were dull, and the top-grade ordinary two kinds of thick japonica rice were shortened by 2 jiao. The buying was extremely quiet, and people's hearts were bearish. Affected by this, although the incoming goods of early indica and early rice were few, the removal was not good, and the price also fell back by nearly a jiao. Lu Yang tip was stagnant and did not move, the opening price was reduced by 5 cents, and the price of Bian Yinyuan and Xin Jing was uniformly settled.</p>
<p>Few people were in the early market at Xinzha. The top-grade Changxi goods and Zhongguan were shortened by 2-3 jiao each. Qingjiao, Shipu, Songjiang, Jiashan and other early and late rice arrivals were weak and tasteless, and the inventory was still thick. The opening price was shortened by 1 and a half jiao.</p>
<p>The retail sales of Dongxin japonica rice were not good, and the situation was flat. Bian Yinyuan wineries had no appetite at all, and the price continued to fall, and the inland source was 167.</p>

<p>Foreign rice continues to fall by 1-2 jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was affected by the arrival of Xiang rice at the port. The market saw a gradual decline, and the foreign rice cargo owners deliberately used small prices to cut off the source of Zhou rice. Foreign rice has fallen by about 4 jiao in the past two days, so it is more difficult for Xiang rice arriving in Shanghai to make a profit. The cost of Xiangji Duan rice must be 9 yuan 45, and the cost of Qi rice must also be 9 yuan. Yesterday's sales price even lost as much as 3-4 jiao. It was planned to open 100 bags of Hunan Ji Jinggang rice at a price of 9 yuan 2 jiao, and 103 bags of Qi rice at a price of 8 yuan 7 jiao, which was handled by the Beiyang gang. Due to the drop in price of foreign rice, sales were driven, and it was planned to send 800 bags of Saigon rice to Beiyang such as Tianjin and Yantai, and 2,000 bags to Jiangbei, Chongming, Inland, and Benjie, with prices ranging from 9 yuan to 8 yuan 9 jiao half to 8 jiao. Compared with the previous day, it continued to be reduced by 1 jiao. A total of 1,500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were opened at a price of 9 yuan 7 jiao half to 6 jiao, a reduction of 2 jiao from the previous day. It is heard that the second batch of Xiang rice has already been loaded, with a combined price of 9 yuan 12 jiao. It is difficult to predict whether it can make a profit after arriving in Shen.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, showed an initial flat and then firm trend. As the price of foreign wheat rebounded by about 1 jiao to 4-5 jiao, people's hearts were originally still stable, but because off-market bulls had slightly closed, the actual sales gangs did not enter or exit, and it was slightly weak. Until the opening in the afternoon, the recent ups and downs were very slight, and the far-term price changed as the northern gangs moved slightly, but the transaction was still lonely, and the factory also rejected it. In the future, the rise and fall will depend on whether the northern sales will increase their needs due to the flood, and this is what can be noted. As a result, this month was 2.5 li better than the previous day, September was 5 li better, October was 1 fen 2.5 li better, November and December were 5 li better, and January was 7.5 li better.</p>

<p>Recently, the raw silk market in foreign firms has become increasingly active. The price of factory-dried silk has risen by dozens of taels. The price of domestic silk has also risen sharply. Various silk weaving factories are purchasing domestic silk due to the high price of factory-dried silk. The price of fine and fat silk in Hangzhou has risen sharply by eight or nine yuan per hundred taels. Fine silk is now priced at thirty-four yuan, and fat silk at twenty-six yuan. In the local silk market, manufacturers are aware of the strong demand for yellow and white factory-dried silk from Europe and the United States, coupled with the speculative hoarding by merchants, and the scarce stock of raw materials (i.e., dried cocoons) cannot meet the demand, so they insist on selling at high prices. Yesterday, many telegrams were sent out for factory-dried silk. The factory price for Grade B white factory-dried silk is seven hundred fifty-six taels, and even the price for Sichuan-Shandong yellow factory-dried silk is six hundred forty-five taels. A decision must be made after the telegram is forwarded. Yesterday, the market sentiment was held back, and both Chinese and foreign parties were waiting to see how the overseas telegram would be forwarded before making a decision. Transactions are pending.</p>

<p>Hardware transactions have been quiet recently, presumably due to the poor environment, and there is little development in various sectors, so the number of goods opened throughout the city is still limited. Although bamboo steel, lead, tinplate, British steel plate, and new lead wire were sold yesterday, there has been little change in prices. However, there is a surprising piece of news, that is, it is rumored in the market that a Tianjin company has shipped six- or seven-foot flat galvanized iron to Shanghai. In the past, the Tianjin companies and other neighboring companies in Beiping, Qingdao, and Jinan all purchased flat galvanized iron from Shanghai. In the past four or five years, due to the arrival of galvanized iron from Japan, the market in the northern ports has been strongly occupied. Therefore, the flat galvanized iron in Shanghai could not be shipped to Tianjin and other places. Now, there is a turning point in the Shanghai galvanized iron market, and Tianjin suddenly has spot goods that can be shipped and sold in Shanghai. This has surprised all hardware merchants. However, the reporter could not prejudge whether the goods are from Japan or England because he has not seen them personally.</p>

<p>Raw Sugar and White Sugar Prices Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were few transactions in the sugar market's public exchange. The buying interest for Dutch sugar No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar was sluggish, and the number of units being offered for sale surged. Initially, the prices were maintained, but eventually they fell. The transaction price for No. 24 coarse sugar was fourteen taels and four mace and a half. No. 14 raw brown sugar was twelve taels and six mace and a half, and No. 8 and 9 Dutch brown sugar was fourteen taels, six or seven qian. There were also few transactions for oil bags at ten taels and five qian. Transactions for Taikoo sugar were also sparse. B mark was sixteen taels and two qian and a half, CW mark was fifteen taels and seven qian, HX mark was fifteen taels and one qian and a half, and DY was fifteen taels and five qian. The market was stable. There were many transactions for Dutch sugar at discounted prices. Da Chang Yangxing sold 300 tons of No. 8 and 9 Dutch brown sugar to be shipped in September at a price of 3.95 Dutch guilders. Tianxiang sold 200 tons of goods for immediate shipment at a price of four guilders. Simultaneously, Changxing opened a price of 3.95 guilders, rising to four guilders, for goods to be shipped in September, totaling 400 tons. Bingchang Hao sold 100 tons of instant bowl green at a price of 3.075 guilders. All are new regulations and foreign taxes. The market outlook is still fair.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been few arrivals of Xiamen tangerine peels. It was found that the Taikoo's Ningbo ship, which entered from Xiamen the day before yesterday, only brought dozens of pieces, and the cost was higher than before. Most of them are self-operated. Therefore, the market situation has suddenly become tight. It is heard that the company price opened yesterday, rising by one or two taels compared to before.

<p>The market price of Liujiang white coal has weakened again in recent days. Few customers from outside are visiting, and local peers are also buying less.

<h3 id="e210">County Magistrate Punished with Kneeling and Military Beating <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>The county magistrate is the official closest to the people, and therefore the quality of the county magistrate is of utmost importance to the people. Strict supervision by both the government and the people is necessary. According to a telegram from Jinan yesterday, Han Fuju interrogated Zou County Magistrate Xue Dayu in the Provincial</p>
<p>Government for abusing fines. Xue was sentenced to kneel, dismissed from his post, and fined 1,500 yuan to compensate the people for their losses. Lu Juemin, the county magistrate of Pingyuan, was accused of abusing fines during his tenure in Changshan. He was sentenced to kneel, receive fifty blows, and fined 1,500 yuan to compensate the people for their losses. Such things, if heard occasionally, would surely be considered strange news, seemingly an extremely outrageous act. However, I want to consider this carefully. The embezzlement and perversion of justice by county magistrates in various places can be considered a very common epidemic. Although the government has promulgated the regulations for the punishment of officials for a long time, and there is a Supervisory Yuan to impeach them, corrupt and lawless officials still operate everywhere. There are three reasons for this. First, many current county magistrates have powerful backers. These county magistrates rely on their support and act recklessly, disregarding national laws. Second, the people fear officials as they fear gods. Even if they suffer injustice to any extent, they dare not appeal to higher authorities, fearing that officials will protect each other, and if the lawsuit is unsuccessful, it will be even more disastrous. Third, although the government has regulations for the punishment of officials and a Supervisory Yuan, there is no effective method of supervision. Even if officials are extorting the people and imposing harsh taxes every day, how can the government know? Therefore, laws are treated as trivial matters and are completely disregarded.</p>
<p>If such county magistrates are not punished like Han Fuju's kneeling and military beating, there is no other way. In the Republican era, the ritual of kneeling has long been abolished, and punishing by kneeling seems inappropriate. Furthermore, the punishment of military beating is used for soldiers, and using it on county magistrates this time naturally seems inappropriate. The saying goes, "Use severe punishments to govern a chaotic country." The methods of punishment in past dynasties, whether severe or lenient, were not fixed. As long as the offenders are afraid, that is enough. The so-called "killing a dog to scare the monkeys." Although this saying does not conform to modern trends, it is very suitable for officials who are greedy and insatiable. Only such methods may be effective for such county magistrates. Therefore, I only feel relieved about Han's beating of the county magistrate. Originally, princes and commoners are equal before the law. What does it matter to beat such county magistrates a few times?</p>
<p>However, this method can only bring temporary satisfaction and is not a fundamental solution. The fundamental solution, on the government's side, although there is a Supervisory Yuan, it is still necessary to study how to supervise and how to observe. If we only rely on people's accusations and send people to investigate, what if the people dare not report? What if the investigators have problems? The injustice will inevitably sink to the bottom of the sea. Therefore, the best method is to let the people supervise, which is closer and more intimate. The people's suffering should be addressed by the people themselves. But now, the people do not pay attention to such events, which is truly strange.</p>

<p>— Yin Zhen</p>
<p>We see glass everywhere. It is a transparent solid, resistant to water and acids. Because of its valuable properties, it has a wide range of uses, including optical instruments and all kinds of daily necessities and decorations.</p>
<p>Glass can be divided into three types: 1. Ordinary glass (soda glass), 2. Hard glass (potash glass), and 3. Aluminum glass.</p>
<p>The components of glass generally include ash, potassium carbonate, and ordinary silicon dioxide.</p>
<p>However, the components vary depending on the type of glass.</p>
<p>1. Ordinary glass is composed of sodium silicate, calcium silicate, and silicon dioxide.</p>
<p>2. Hard glass has the same components.</p>
<p>3. Aluminum glass is composed of potassium silicate and aluminum silicate.</p>
<p>The properties of glass also vary depending on the type.</p>
<p>1. Ordinary glass has a slightly greenish color, is easily melted, and has weak resistance to chemicals.</p>
<p>2. Hard glass is colorless, difficult to melt, and has strong resistance to chemicals.</p>
<p>3. Aluminum glass is very soft, easily melted, heavy, and has a strong refractive index.</p>
<p>The uses of glass are determined by its properties. 1. Ordinary glass is used to make window panes, bottles, and ordinary utensils.</p>
<p>2. Hard glass is used to make decorations and chemical instruments. 3. Aluminum glass is used to make decorations and optical instruments. The raw materials for glass are 1. Ordinary glass: sodium carbonate or sodium silicate and charcoal silicon dioxide (silica) (sand or quartz) calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>2. Hard glass: potassium carbonate silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>3. Aluminum glass: potassium carbonate, silicon dioxide, aluminum dioxide.</p>
<p>The manufacturing method of glass is to melt all the raw materials together. When it is melted into a liquid, cool it slightly and blow it into a mold to form various utensils.</p>
<p>The method of making colored glass is the same as ordinary glass, but adding a small amount of metal gas compounds will produce color. Aluminum (Co) becomes blue, chromium (Cr) becomes green, gold (Au) becomes red, and uranium becomes yellow.</p>
<p>To make opaque milky white glass, add feldspar or fluorite.</p>

<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Miss L is a thorough modern student. Every day when she goes to school, in addition to a few textbooks, she also has a love novel and a wallet. This wallet is like a cosmetics store in Jinli, where all kinds of cosmetics can be found.</p>
<p>It has been less than two weeks since the summer school started, and no one among the students does not know her name, because Miss L is not only a modern student, but also a socialite.</p>
<p>Although Miss L does not have natural beauty, she has the beauty of material and makeup, which is enough to intoxicate the heroes. So now she has become a plaything for some of the male students and is used by them.</p>
<p>One morning, after the first class, Miss L pulled Ms. W out of the classroom to talk. She said: "Mr. C is an excellent student at XX Middle School. He has admired you for a long time. You shouldn't be so cruel. I know this is a woman's way, and I can't just blame you. But you must know that Mr. C is going to seek death because of your cold attitude. He said that he wanted to sacrifice for love. Sister W, think about it yourself. Someone is going to die for you!" These words were nothing else, but Ms. W was so frightened that she broke into a cold sweat. Indeed, such words containing seduction and intimidation are so terrible for a woman who has not experienced the baptism of love!</p>
<p>A day later, Miss L sent a pink love letter to Ms. W on behalf of Mr. C. Miss L, who uses the name of studying to be a socialite, is very used to this kind of love letter, but Ms. W is an orphan without parents or siblings. Her coming to school is to build a foundation for her future independence. However, she is also an emotional person. This kind of love letter is very difficult for Ms. W.</p>
<p>Now Ms. W has been led astray by Miss L. The two different paths in front of her will bring Ms. W future happiness and depression. If Ms. W does not wake up early, I am afraid that she will be assimilated by Miss L soon.</p>
<p>Society Reform Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e215">My Opinion on the Trend of Improving Men's and Women's Clothing Towards Simplicity <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Siwei</p>
<p>Many people have discussed the issue of improving men's and women's clothing. I will not be too verbose and will offer a few more words. I can divide the current social situation into three classes below.</p>
<p>A. Aristocracy</p>
<p>B. Well-off</p>
<p>C. Commoners</p>
<p>[A] Aristocratic families do not know the difficulty and origin of material resources. When the lights are lit up, we can see the extravagant aristocratic young masters and ladies wearing brightly colored imported clothes and riding fast cars to show off their wealth. It may not be important for them to spend a few more dollars and change their clothes every day, but it may arouse the covetousness of petty thieves. As the saying goes, "Extravagant possessions invite theft, and alluring looks invite licentiousness!"</p>
<p>[B] Well-off families may have a psychology of currying favor with the powerful and have to put on a show. Therefore, their clothes are almost the same as the aristocratic class. As the saying goes, "A donkey running after a horse." I wonder how they can keep up, and they may even sprain their feet.</p>
<p>[C] The commoner class is very different from the bourgeois class. They all rely on the rewards earned by their own labor to maintain their family's life. For example, ordinary employees in shops or companies earn only dozens of yuan a month. Their clothes can be more simple, but in fact, it is often not the case, especially women. They never pity the money earned by their fathers, brothers, or husbands, and do not think about being frugal. They may even quarrel with their fathers, brothers, or husbands for new clothes. Even if the husband has no money, he must borrow it to buy them. Isn't this what people call "dying to show off"?</p>
<p>In short, the current phenomenon in China cannot be improved merely by a few worn-out pens and a few newspapers publicizing it. It must be done in practice. Moreover, most of the beautiful clothes worn by people of the upper, middle, and lower classes are imported goods. The amount of money flowing out every year is really alarming. Therefore, I am not afraid of the readers' boredom and will write it out as much as possible. One is for frugality, which is a virtue, and can improve customs. The other is for the sake of the survival of the great Chinese nation. I hope that all Chinese people will change to wearing domestic clothes to avoid the outflow of money. You see, foreigners earn the money of the Chinese people and use it to make guns to fight against China. That is our own Chinese people's lack of competitiveness!

<h3 id="e216">The Master of the Irritable Temper <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Niaozuo</p>
<p>The "Master of the Irritable Temper" mentioned here is "Mrs. Zhang," who lives with us in the same house. Although she is considered an intellectual, her harshness and irritability towards the maids are so severe that anyone who sees it will have a dizzy spell!</p>
<p>She is one of those who like to read our old Shanghai News every morning, and she loves to read this small corner of the "Local Supplement." Therefore, I am now specifically listing her recent irritable actions and publishing them here. I hope that after she reads it, her face will turn red at that moment, and then she will strive to change her ways and stop doing that kind of unconscious behavior that is criticized as "acting important" and "acting high and mighty."</p>
<p>Below is a true portrayal of her irritable actions.</p>
<p>One day, her maid, called Qin Ma, bought some vegetables and came back to her and said: "Madam! The vegetables have been bought. Please go to the kitchen to take a look." This was her daily routine, fearing that the maids would lie and she had to check the things they bought. Unexpectedly, this time she rolled her eyes and said: "You all have become madams! Do you want me to walk to the kitchen to see the vegetables that you bought?" Qin Ma was scolded for no reason. The next day, she bought some vegetables and immediately brought them to her to see. Unexpectedly, she became angry again and said angrily: "Oh! Are you crazy? Have all those years been transferred to the yellow dog? Filthy things, bring them into the room, do you think I've broken my legs and can't go to the kitchen to see?"</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>The evening glow spread across the sky like a lovely beauty. Qin Ma wondered why her mistress had not yet given the order to prepare dinner. Taking the opportunity, she went to ask her if she needed to prepare dinner. She seemed to see a black lacquered bench beside her, acting coquettishly and even more domineeringly: "Are you hungry like a dog? Why are you urging me so impatiently!" Everyone, think about it: would Qin Ma dare to ask her again next time, only to be rudely dismissed? However, she was also harmed by her trembling liver fire: it turned out that two evenings later, she saw that dinner had not been prepared, and she called Qin Ma to question her: "The electric lights have been turned on for a long time. Is this your first day here? Why hasn't dinner been served yet? You've really become madams, and everything has to be respectfully requested! Such a clumsy thing like an abacus bead!"</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>The motive for writing this article is not only dedicated to her, but also dedicated to all the young masters and madams who have servants. It is also a sorrowful voice on behalf of those servants who, for the sake of poverty, do not hesitate to abandon their flesh and blood and bow their heads to work like cattle and horses, calling for help from the young masters and madams.</p>

<p>Incoming Letter</p>
<p>To the esteemed editors of the Local Supplement: Since your newspaper's supplement has a science column, I have been reading it every day and learning a lot, especially regarding the various industrial experiments. I previously cut out Mr. Naizheng's method of making ink and planned to go to a pharmacy or instrument store to prepare the medicine and try to make it. However, since "sulfuric acid indigo" has no English name, the pharmacies and instrument stores cannot figure out what medicine it is. I am writing this letter to inquire or ask for Mr. Naizheng's address so that I can ask directly. Many thanks for your trouble. Sincerely, Jin Yusan, No. 497501 Kangnaot Road, August 17th, 21st year.</p>
