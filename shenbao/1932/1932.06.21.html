<h3>涇惠渠放水典禮感言　彬</h3>
<p>陜西渭北之涇惠渠。自前年十月開工。今已告成。一昨并已正式舉行放水典禮。斯渠旣成。引涇灌漑。茲後渭北之涇陽高陵三原臨潼醴泉五縣。庶幾其得免於旱荒。工程雖不若何鉅大。然而此種建設工作。在今日要爲難得。深足令人欣慶。</p>
<p>涇水爲渭水之支流。經流之地。皆爲沃壤。惟以氣候枯燥。常苦旱暘。故此天然之水利。最宜灌漑。溯諸史實。引涇漑田者。在秦有鄭國開渠。起谷口沿北山絶冶清漆沮諸水而入於洛。史稱漑田四萬五千頃。關中自此無凶年。在漢有白公開渠。渠今尙存。在宋有豐利渠。在元有王御史渠。明有廣惠渠通濟渠。清季復築壩拒涇。專引泉水。改稱龍洞渠。自茲以降。渠身罅漏。漑田日少水利無以利用。渭北各屬。乃又不免於旱荒。民國以來。政治紛亂。内戰迭作。政府旣無暇顧及建設。人民則又以社會經濟日趨於破落生計日艱。亦無力以整頓水利。改良農事。十九年隴海一役。更陷陜甘於不復之慘境。寖致人民防災之力愈以薄弱。而災荒乃愈以慘重。前年西北大旱。陜甘最慘。災黎易子而食。賣婦爲餐。野盈餓莩。道載流亡。蕭條之狀。慘絶人寰。當局即不能積極建設。預弭災荒。但使能消極不造災。不以人力助長自然之災禍。則前年之旱災。亦斷不至如是之慘重。夫有水利而不知利用。徒仰首蒼芎。靜待命運之支配。是不僅可悲。抑亦可恥。今涇惠告成。雖澤僅及於五縣。然而吾人則切盼此爲建設之發端。尤切盼此種建設足以樹立全國之規範。</p>
<p>抑吾人猶有未能已於言者。自近世科學發逹。文明進化。「天災」之説。已根本不能成立。歐美各國於水旱疾疫。種種自然之迫害。預防無不至周。即偶有之亦無不急施救濟。急謀興復。獨有我國。則似立於此文明世界之圈外。舉國顫慄於大自然之前。無日不受其威脅與迫害。旣不能預防。復無法救濟。災荒之來。惟有待死。復從而助以人力。造爲人禍。天災人禍。遂往復相尋。二十年來。無歳不災。江南河北。赤地萬里。人民生無食所。死無葬地。老弱輾轉溝壑。少壯流離四方。國家元氣。斵喪無餘。此眞可爲痛哭流涕長本息者矣。</p>
<p>即如蕩蕩長江。本爲大利。然以積久不治。遂成禍水。去歲水災。禍及多省。至今災區。尙未興復。災黎尙載道途。然而水利建設。則迄未積。極着手。連日霪雨。江水又漲。水患且將復作。極目前途。憂患無極。吾人誠不能不爲枉死之災黎呼冤。更不能不爲僅存之孑遺。哀籲請命。</p>
<p>茲當涇惠工程告成。吾人感觸所及。謹以此籲請政府當局之覺醒。并希望各省以此爲規範而急起直追。</p>

<p>大連爲日租借地乃完全由日本管理者</p>
<p>干涉大連實日本直接侵犯恊定之行動</p>
<p>（北平）　宋子文發表英文聲明、反對僞國接收東北海關、大意稱、近聞僞國將接收東北海關及大連海關、破壞中國關税完整、查東北各地海關、關係中國外債、大連爲日租借地、僞國更何得强行接管該地海關云、（二十日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　宋子文今日發表關於東三省海關事之宣言、略謂往日財政部曾一再發表宣言、請衆注意日政府假託所謂「滿洲國當局」、希圖干涉東三省海關之行政、哈爾濱牛莊安東之税收、已自三月二十八日四月十六日四月十九日先後停止解交總税務司、最近之發展、甚至使局勢更形阽危、據東三省各處税務司報告、僞政府現正在提用扣留各埠之税收、現且擴張其侵逼以逹大連、要求該埠之税收、並命税務司及存儲税欵之銀行、（中國銀行與横濱正金銀行）停止解欵與總税務司、該銀行等現受日當局之控制、已自六月七日起拒絶解欵、此種行動、關係更重、蓋大連海關（迄今完整）所收之税、超過東三省各處所收總額之半數、且大連乃中國租與日本之土地、該處海關、乃於一九零七年由中日締結國際恊定而設立者、當時所謂「滿洲國當局」、干涉安東哈爾濱牛莊海關時、日本謂彼等乃單獨行事、與日政府無關、然識者譏之、但今日大連之舉、日本絲毫不能有所藉口、以諉卸責任、蓋該港乃租與日本、完全由日本管理者、故干涉大連之海關、實爲日本直接侵犯莊嚴國際恊定之行動、東三省各埠海關之税收總額、依近五年所收之數爲根據、平均佔海關税收全額百分之十五、民國二十年東三省税收、共關平銀二六、○七八、○○○兩、等於國幣三九、一一七、○○○元、日本與其傀儡恣意破壞國際恊定與担任、實與全世界至有關係之事件、苟不與爭、則將樹一惡例、而中</p>

<p>國國内外信用總脈之海關、將自此解體矣、匪特中國主要内外借欵及賠欵以海關爲抵、而愆期之借欵、内有許多鐵路借欵、中政府已担任以關餘之一部分償還、且東三省海關税收之喪失、將令以關税爲抵之各種義務、加諸中國其他各埠、在目下經濟困難之中、一國全部海關税收、每年平均約國幣三一○、○○○、○○○元、東三省自亦在内、其中須用以償付以關税爲抵之各項及海關開支者、逾二五○、○○○、○○○元、今於總額内驟失三九、○○○、○○○元之收入、其影響之重大、實不堪應付、佔據税收、其不可免之結果、將爲由僞政府派員管理東三省之所有海關、令其地在經濟上與中國斷絶關係、而在一切目的上、成爲日本之一部分、如朝鮮然、而中國目下之入超、從此更將增高、蓋東三省幾爲中國唯一輸出過剩之要地也、查所謂滿洲國之財政部長、曾於本月照會大連海關税務司、豫示渠將取自衛計畫、而令海關行政之維持完整與國際現狀不成問題、自民國成立以來、國民政府第一次作空前之犧牲、而得量入爲出、東三省之鹽税全數、（内有外國借欵之分配）旣已被佔、今海關税收復被强奪、則其爲害、實難估計、如中國財政命脈所寄之海關、一旦分裂、則必發生莫大之財政禍患、中國之市塲、將爲敗壞、而令全世界感受反響、各友邦今皆關心海關之完整、蓋此爲防杜財政紊亂之砥柱也、彼等關心其借欵與愆付借欵爲抵之海關、彼等負擁護東三省門户開放政策之責任、彼等並莊嚴担保中國土地與行政之完整、世界今已爲經濟凋敝而陷於黑暗矣、各友邦對此嚴酷摧毁四百兆人民償債能力之舉動、必不致熟視無覩也云云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　路透訪員今日以滿洲海關問題、詢諸此間某要津、據答、日政府對滿洲海關人員、無權過問、故大連税務司福本是否遵從長春「滿洲國」當局之請、將税欵停止解滬、抑仍照解、須聽其自己决定、但日當局希望福本行事儘力少使日政府爲難、惟無論出何行動、日本槪不欲加以干涉、聞横濱正金銀行現大爲不安、顯恐福本命其大連分行將收存之税欵停止解交上海總税務司後、中政府或命正金銀行收歇其在華各支行、而佔有其所存税欵、日政府之發言人曾謂日本之關心以海關之税爲抵之債項繼續照付、與其他債權同、但信「滿洲國」當局雖宣布關税自主、而仍將撥税收償付以此爲抵之外債、某某數界之意、大連關税若不解往上海、則必引起關東租借地目下地位問題、即日本應否視該地爲向「滿洲國」租用者、抑仍視爲乃中政府租出者是、政界對於此點、尙未有何評論、而日政府對於「滿洲國」之海關、亦未明示態度、（二十日路透社電）</p>

<p>路透社十九日日内瓦電　瑞典·瑙威·丹麥·荷蘭·比利時·與盧森堡六國外交當軸、在此集議、極力主張儘速一律裁减税則、以抒經濟困苦、據比京消息、比王函致刻在洛桑之比相任金、囑其提倡國際合作、以銷滅經濟危迫、略謂專家咸以爲繁榮之恢復、唯賴物貨資本與勞工之自由流動、今各處税則限制、愈起愈高、馴至輸出大减、國際貿易較前三年僅及其半、而失業人數視前倍增、救濟辦法、舍一致動作莫可奏效云、</p>
<p>路透社十九日日内瓦電　瑞典等六國外交當軸集議反對税則一舉、已引起驚異、衆認此爲有關係國意欲强迫洛桑會議加速步驟、並提出人或視爲宜留待日後世界大會之事件、據尙未證實之消息、瑞典瑙威丹麥荷蘭比利時與盧森堡六國、有如其所建議者不蒙採用、則將單獨行動之計畫、並聞比利時荷蘭與盧森堡三國、不久將宣佈關税聯盟之成立、而瑞典瑙威與丹麥三國亦將步其後塵、而有同様之商務結合、</p>

<p>中國以蘇俄利用使館領館、藏匿·供給·並指揮共黨暴動、於十六年十二月宣告絶交、到現在已有了三年半的時間、在絶交中俄國曾於十八年用飛機大砲進攻中國、造成中東路戰役、强使中國簽訂伯力恊定、中國因此喪權辱國、與現在的上海恊定實不相上下、照伯力恊定、中俄兩國派代表在俄京會議、恊商中東路通商及復交三大問題、這個中俄會議實早已包含討論中俄復交的問題、然以俄政府的刁難和推延、致中國代表團莫德惠等滯留俄京兩年、毫無結果、甚至連會也不會、自然談不到復交、不過到了去年九一八以後、以中國大受日本的武力壓迫、黨國要人如汪精衛陳友仁曾放出對俄復交甚至聯俄的空氣、於是引起對俄復交問題的討論、記者於去年十月卅一日在本報（民聲週刊）第五期上曾發表「抗日聲中的對俄復交問題」一文、從日俄的關係·俄國在國際上的地位·中國與俄絶交的歷史·中國國内的共匪形勢·四方面、詳細説明中國在目前尙不宜對俄復交、並且在該文的開宗明義便表明我們立論的根本度態如下、</p>
<p>「我們且不問主張對俄復交的是什麽人、也不問主張對俄復交的人之眞實背境是怎麽様、但我們必須考究對俄復交與中國的利害究竟怎麽様、在國際間、縱横捭　、只須以本國的利害爲前提、原可朝三暮四、朝四暮三、今天與甲國相聯以抗國、明天又與乙國相聯以抗甲國、這本是極尋常的事件、如果中國對俄復交甚至聯俄確於中國有利、本不妨復交或聯俄、以渡過目前的難關、如果對俄復交甚至聯俄、並不足渡過目前的難關、而且足以增加國家的危險、那就非堅决反對不可、」</p>
<p>此文發表之後經過半年、雖間有贊同或反對的論調、但很少詳細説明正面或反面的理由的、因此本報也就未再加討論、不過到現在政府方面似乎已有對俄復交的傾向（外交部負責人員前後關於對俄問題的表示便是證據）同時人民方面也有堅决張對俄復交的、究竟立即對俄復交於中國有利還是有害、於中國是利多害少、還是利少害多、在未實行復交以前、我們還應從長討論一下、最近主張對俄復交最力者、恐怕要數申報記者陳彬龢君罷、他在申報上連做了五篇時評、（見註一）用很肯定的語氣説、「吾人力主中蘇立即復交」、（見註二）「吾人力主對蘇復交、並深盼當局打破一切之阻力、斷然促其實現」、並且指斥反對中俄復交者爲「過慮」、爲「短見」、「怯懦」、爲「苟安」、爲「保守派」、爲「似是而實非」、爲「似多偏重感情之偏激之言而少平心靜氣沉着踐實之論」、以素稱「過慮」、「怯懦」而且「保守」的申報而有這様堅决論調的時評、我不能不佩服陳彬龢君的勇氣、不過陳君的主張、究竟對不對、我們認爲還大有討論的必要、大晚報記者曾虚白君曾與陳君再三討論、我們也不妨加入戰團、妄參末議、在未加入戰團以前、我們要與陳君約定兩事如下、</p>
<p>第一無論主張如何、必須以中國本身的利害做根本原則、詳細的説、必須看明立即對俄復交於中國是利多害少、還是利少害多、利多害少則不妨立即復交、害多利少則萬萬不宜立即復交、反正的主張都須以國家的利害做判斷的標準、</p>
<p>第二無論主張如何、照陳君所説、「對此問題部平心靜氣、切實討論」、陳君再不宜指斥反對中俄復交者爲「短見」、爲「保守派」、我們也决不指斥主張中俄復交者爲「衝動」爲「投機派」、雙方自行壓下感情的論調、然後才能使人明瞭討論的結果、</p>
<h3>所謂新的外交方針就是對俄復交嗎？</h3>
<p>自暴日佔領東北以來、太平洋的風雲益加緊張、中國的命運益加危迫、我們要在緊張的風雲中將危迫的國運挽救過來、自然除在政治軍事經濟敎育等項上想基本的辦法以外、還須在外交策略上想輔助的辦法、這是無人可以反對的、因此陳君所謂「從速樹立新的外交方針、以謀應付來日之大難」、在原則上我們也可以贊同、不過陳君所謂「新的外交方針」、就是對俄復交嗎、還要聯俄呢、我們再三細讀陳君的五篇時評、好像是明白的主張復交、含糊的主張聯俄、而又怕人説他的所謂復交就是聯俄、陳君說、「復交非聯蘇、尤非容共、但爲恢復普通之外交關係、此爲普通常識、吾人絕不應有若何之誤解、」</p>
<p>不錯、由普通常識看來、復交只是「恢復普通之外交關係」、不過由中俄的過去歷史與俄國指揮下的中國國内共黨形勢上看、對俄復交除「恢復普通之外交關係」外、還有其他的重要關係、留待後面再說、姑且假定陳君所謂復交只限於「恢復普通之外交關係」、那末、我們便要請問陳君只與俄國「恢復普通外交關係」就配稱爲新的外交方針」嗎、更配「以謀應付來日之大難」嗎、如果說對俄只限復交、便足稱爲「新的外交方針」、更能「應付來日之大難」、則英美甚至用武力侵略中國的日本都早與中國有「普通之外交關係」、何以不能救中國的危亡、從前中國曾與俄復交、也不足以救中國的危亡、而反增中國的危險、可見只對俄恢復普通外交關係、决不能「應付來日之大難」也不足稱爲新的外交方針」、陳君或者也明白對俄只恢復普通外交關係、並不稱什麽新的外交方針、所以陳君又說「試問我國今日在外交上與國何在、非完全陷於孤立之地位乎、處於如斯嚴重情勢之下、其將坐待强鄰之宰割乎、抑應從速樹立新的外交方針以謀應付來日之大難乎、今日我國當前壓迫爲日本、新的外交方針、自應以聯合以平等待我之民族、保領土行政主權之完整爲基礎、法旣與日有諒解之說、英與意亦無力東顧、美日衝突、雖日益激化、美可引爲我之與國、但亦有鞭長莫及之憂、獨蘇聯爲太平洋問題中最應注目之一要角、自彼革命而後、且自動宣告放棄舊俄時代與我訂立之一争不平等條約、并地理上天然爲我之與國、蓋無可置疑、我對蘇聯復交、在外交之局勢上、可收互相依庇之效、德土交蘇聯而得以打破外交上之艱局、即其例證、以地大物博民衆之兩大、如一旦復交、則太平洋上之局勢、自爲之大變、故我國今日如不甘坐待宰割、則新的外交方針必以此爲基礎、」</p>
<p>這段議論中所謂「與國」、所謂「獨有蘇聯爲太平洋問題中最應注目之一要角、並地理上天然爲我之與國」、所謂「新的外交方針必以此爲基礎」等等、簡直是「聯俄論、」决不僅是「復交論」、與國必須先有邦交、復了邦交不一定就是與國、英美法日等列强、都與中國有邦交、但幾乎沒有一個眞正算做中國的與國、甚至還有的是中國的敵國例如日本、陳君所謂對俄復交、如只限於「恢復普通外交關係」便不能即引俄國爲與國、如認定「獨有蘇聯爲我之與國、新的外交方針必以此爲基礎」便不是單純的復交論、至少陳君所謂復交是聯俄的準備、不僅限於「恢復普通外交關係」而已、陳君所謂「新的外交方針」之應從長討論的焦點、不在單純的復交論、而在準備聯俄的復交論、說到聯俄或準備聯俄的復交、我們便不可忘却兩次的歷史敎訓、第一次是李鴻章聯俄國敎訓、第二次是孫中山聯俄的敎訓、第一次聯俄的敎訓比較遠點、還不大令人注意、第二次聯俄的敎訓如中國的孤立、黨國的分爭、共匪的猖獗等等、由聯俄所促起的惡果、都還擺在我們眼前、我們就忘却了嗎、「前事之不忘、後事之師也、」我要勸勸陳君將聯俄的歷史敎訓再細細想想、必可恍然大悟了、彷佛陳君已經知道聯俄的歷史敎訓還存在一般人腦中、不便逕直提出聯俄的主張、只好寓聯俄的主張於復交的主張之中、以蒙混讀者的視聴、我這様說、過於深刻、或者陳君碍難承認、那末我就要請陳君將名爲復交實爲聯俄的論調斟酌取消、以免立論不清、自相矛盾、</p>
<h3>二、復交、聯俄與容共是截然的三事嗎？</h3>
<p>由上節說來、陳君的論旨重在聯俄以樹立所謂新的外交方針、而其措詞又再三說明「吾人認爲在討論此一問題之先、須認清「復交」「聯俄」與「容共」爲三事、不容相提並論、「以求讀者免於誤解、不錯、照常識說、復交、聯俄、與容共確爲三事、不是一事、我是認清了的、不過此三事是截然無關的三事、還是互有關聯的三事、我們在討論此一問題之先、也必須認清、復交聯俄和容共之所以在形式上成爲三事、因爲各國與俄復交的不必聯俄、聯俄不必容共的種種事例、例如英國與俄復交但並不聯俄、土耳基聯俄但並不容共、這可以使我們明確認清、用不着再三的說明、不過復交·聯俄·和容共絕對不是截然無關的三事、而是互有密切關聯的三事、不易爲人明確認清、恐怕陳彬龢君對於這點也未十分認清罷、</p>
<p>容共必先聯俄、聯俄必先復交、這是他們必然的普通關係、無論何人不能否認的、而且在中國目前的特殊情形之下、一經對俄復交、勢必趨於聯俄、甚至容共、他們更有特殊的關聯、不能視爲截然無關的三事、何以這様說呢、第一因目前全國人民莫不痛恨日本的横暴、在自己本身上一時想不出抵禦的辦法來、痴想找一個與國來爲我國應付急難、現在主張對俄復交的人們除極少數别有背景或有作用的以外、大槪都爲這種情勢所驅使、單只復交並不能打開中國外交上的難關、那末、復交之後、便不得不趨於聯俄、從前李鴻章的聯俄是想利用俄國抵制日本、反爲俄國所利用、又不能抵制日本致造成日俄瓜分東北形勢、孫中山的聯俄是想利用俄國打倒帝國主義、結果白色帝國主義尙未打倒、赤色帝國主義反因此深入腹地爲禍未已、現在主張對俄復交和聯俄的人們、就其心理的動機說、多半仍不出李孫兩人的範圍、也不過想用俄國抵制日本、但是赤色帝國主義蘇俄所給予中國的致命傷、並不下於白色帝國主義的日本、日本製造僞國統治東北、蘇俄也曾製造僞國統治外蒙、日本用暴力侵略中國、蘇俄也曾用暴力進攻中國（中東戰役）日本在中國的邊疆用軍隊壓迫、同時蘇俄也用他的便衣隊即共黨在中國的腹地擾亂、使中國對日的長期抵制、有了後顧之憂、這都是事實、怎麽可以前門拒虎、後門迎狼呢、更怎麽可以虎未拒走、即行迎狼呢、我們認清日前堅决主張復交者旣多含有聯俄的傾向、而中國的形勢又有走向聯俄的危險、復交和聯俄確有密切關係、故我們堅决反對聯俄者、也不得不堅决反對立即復交、（未完）</p>

<h3>軍政部兵工署議决撤廢滬兵工廠</h3>
<p>各種機件分運漢鞏等處</p>
<p>房屋基地實行標價拍賣</p>
<p>職工等推代表請收成命</p>
<p>上海兵工廠、開辦迄今、歷有年所、其間國内迭次戰爭、該廠供應藥彈、爲數至鉅、江浙之役以後、該廠以關係重要、尤爲兵家所必爭、而影響所及、致有前總商會要求停建兵器、改造農具之議、惟迄今未行、一二八事變發生、該廠以環境關係、當將各項機件拆卸運杭、恊定簽字後、該廠工人曾迭次要求、搬回復工、均未邀准、茲悉軍政部及兵工署已批准德顧問撤廢該廠主張、職工等聞訊、昨已派代表晋京、請求收回成命、各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>兵工廠沿革　上海兵工廠、係前清同治三年、由曾國藩·李鴻章·奏請開辦、初設虹口、範圍至爲狹隘、僅能修配槍枝零件、嗣於同治七年、遷至高昌廟、廠務逐漸擴充、出品則年有增加、民國肇興、各省内戰頻仍、江浙之役、上海兵工廠以軍實所在、遂成兩軍必爭之地、滬南商市、頓形蕭條、前上海總商會、乃於民十四年、呈請陸軍部、將該廠撤廢、改造農工器具、民十五孫傳芳任五省聯軍總司令、因械彈缺乏、復又下令開工、迨革命軍北伐告成、國府奠都南京、對該廠銳意改革、添置機器、改用電力、出品突然增加、除東省兵工廠外、滬廠在全國兵工廠中、堪稱首屈一指、</p>
<p>一二八事變　二二八事變後、該廠恐遭意外、乃於三月間、奉軍政部令、將各製造廠全部機器、移往杭州、所有工人三千五百餘名、除製砲廠以尙有舊砲數十尊·及要塞砲零件未完工、尙有一部份工人留廠修理外、餘者槪由該廠給恩餉兩個月遣散、</p>
<p>工人請復工　惟該廠工人、多爲製造兵器之專門工匠、此次突被遣散、一時無處謀生、除少數人返籍外、大部份工匠、均逗留高昌廟一帶、靜待兵工廠恢復、以便前往復工、停戰恊定簽字後、復由該廠工會、推派代表、赴京請願、要求軍政部及兵工署、將該廠機器、早日搬回、以便復工、曾蒙軍政部派交際主任周某·兵工署派科長李某、接見、允爲轉逹、並稱該項機器、三星期内、即可搬回、工會代表、認爲滿意、遂行返滬、</p>
<p>蔣批准撤廢　不料最近忽有前任該廠顧問之德人布魯麥、上一條陳於蔣委員長、主張將滬廠機器、分撥各兵工廠、原有廠地廚房等、一律拍賣、當經蔣氏批准、並飭軍政部進行、軍政部奉命後、遂會同兵工署、於上星期開會討論、議决、將上海兵工廠機器招標、由杭州運赴南京、再行分撥漢陽·金陵·鞏縣·三廠並委德顧問布魯麥·卡勃·杜爾華·及兵工署專任委員譚伯羽莊權赴杭、主持搬運、</p>
<p>請收回成命　該廠職工聞此消息後、極爲驚惶、僉以滬廠不但地位重要、且東南各省軍械、全持該廠接濟、當此匪共猖獗、國防吃緊之際、一旦遽將該廠撤廢、軍實補充、恐有斷絕之虞、而數千工人、今後生計、尤爲可慮、故已推由審計處長胡嗣鴻·砲彈廠主任王承黻·槍廠主任林爲榕·於昨晚夜車晋京請願、要求取消該議、工會方面、亦由各廠理事、分頭進行、以期共同努力、逹到收回成命之目的云、</p>

<p>張福運晋京請示　關務署署長張福運、對於僞國攫奪關税之消息、業已接到東北海關方面正式電告、張氏對此事、定日内晋京請示、俟中央指示措置辦法後、再定如何交涉、現尙不願表示意見、</p>
<p>梅樂和未有表示　據總税務司梅樂各云、本人對此事雖已接到報告、但無意見發表、至爲歉仄、其事君宜詢國府財政當局、或有相當意見表示、繼記者又詢以此事英人之態度若何、梅氏云、余實未聞、然須詢之英領事方面、方能知其情形云云、</p>
<p>大美晚報之記載　大美晚報云、昨日「滿洲國」政府發表宣言、擬佔據大連及滿洲各處之中國海關、大美晚報訪員今晨（二十日）曾因此訪問本埠各行政機關、當局對於此事、未加評論、惟謂國民政府將依照廬山會議所定之政策行事、海關總税務司梅樂各亦不欲評論此事、謂關於該問題之一切消息、僅將由財政部發表、訪諸財政部駐滬辦公處、僅知該部對於「滿洲國」之宣言、冷淡處之、此外罕有所聞、聞「滿洲國」發表宣言之前、曾於三月二十一日照會國民政府、請將大連及滿洲他處之海關讓交滿洲當局執管、税則照舊、所收之税、除抵付外債等者解交南京外、餘歸「滿洲政府」所有、職員均不更動、國民政府以遵守不承認之政策、置之不覆、</p>

<h3>租界電話工人今日舉行大會</h3>

<h3>市商會贈萬國商團旗幟</h3>
<p>王曉籟有懇　演說</p>
<p>六月二十日午後一時、市商會主席王曉籟君、由華　袁履登君、陪同至工部局、以旗幟一面、贈送與　國商團、以誌其在最近中日衝突中之勞績、該旗幟由中國童子軍及樂隊護送、至商團操塲、至時、由商團每隊之代表軍官出而接待、於是童子軍列隊於福州路、面北、商團軍官則在其東、王袁兩君、乃自商團俱樂部中、由司令湯穆士、副司令麥米加而氏、及少校吳君、徐君、上尉辛池可立夫君、偕同入塲、於是王曉籟君舉旗贈與湯穆士司令、並爲下列之演說、</p>
<p>王曉籟致詞　上海自開闢爲通商口岸、設置公共租界以來、經過國際戰爭者兩次、而租界内中外居民、均安享其和平秩序、未嘗受有戰事恐慌、此兩次戰事、第一次距今四十九年、第二次距今三十八年、現在旅滬各友邦商人中、想尙有經商年久、親身經歷之人、回憶此兩次戰事、雖經過之時間、均在八個月以上、一年以外、然揚子江之商業、國際共同經營之租界、頗能爲人所重視、是以中國當日、雖亦於吳淞要塞增戍設防、然絲毫不影響於租界、足徴中國自與各國訂約以後、對於各國公共通商之區域、向來極其保護重視、此種政策、至今並未改變、甚致自己受極大之犧牲、而仍極端忍耐、極力節制、所以本年公共租界雖遭遇重大之困難、爲四十九年前三十八年前、所未經夢想得到之事變、然猶能保全此八九十年來苦心經營之區域、使不致成爲一片廢墟者、鄙人以爲實有兩大原因、一由於中國軍隊有極端之容忍力、實抱有愛人如己愛敵如己之精神、一由於萬國商團富有防衛之實力、與其義勇奉公之精神、是以本會於欽佩之餘、舉行贈旗典禮、以表永矢勿諼之意、并將中國一向尊重租界之治安、及向來租界治安、頗能爲人尊重之歷史、重述一番、表示今後深切之期望、想在座諸公、必與有同情也、</p>
<p>湯穆士答詞　王君言畢、當由湯穆士司令答稱、「中國商會、以此美麗之旗見贈、鄙人代表商團接受、深感其榮幸、而王君不辭勞苦、躬親光降、敝團尤爲感佩、今日每隊皆有代表蒞塲、乃所以表示商團保護租界之精神一致、商團乃工部局之僕役、於其服役之時、不知有政治問題、其目標惟有維持治安、與保護居民之生命財產、而不問其國籍、本團今後有此旗幟、將使人人永誌本團與中國商會之友好關係、將永遠　貴之也、</p>
<h3>越界築路管理權</h3>

<p>查此案反對者、份子複雜、最著者當爲日本人、蓋駐滬日僑與東京日人、自停戰以來、互相呼應、竭力鼓吹開圓桌會議、以解决上海問題、其最要目的、實欲貫澈其上海不駐兵·並設自由市之主張、所以對於中國收回越界築路管理權、亦盡力反對、同時又有一部份西人、彼等以爲中國收回越界築路之管理權、即係收回租界之先聲、爲欲保存租界、故並越界築路之管理權、亦不肯放棄、更有一部份中國人、在越界築路區域置有地產者、彼等以爲管理權一經收回、地價即當降落、爲私人利益計、不惜爲虎作倀、助反對者之聲勢、尙有一小部份、係與政治有關之中國人、而向來居住或置產於該區域者、以爲越界築路管理權收回後、中國警察可以行使職權、是於彼等政治活動有所不利、故亦暗中反對、但反對者份子旣極複雜、抱負又各不同、其力量殊爲微薄、市府此次交涉之方針、以不放棄主權爲原則、吾人試觀現在越界築路上喧賓奪主之情形、益覺此問題有從速解决之必要也云、</p>

<h3>市衛生試騐所爆炸失火慘劇</h3>
<p>燬屋兩間死一傷二</p>
<p>肇事原因尚未查明</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時五十分、閘北廣東街錦華坊口上海市衛生試騐所後樓下層藥料房、突然爆炸起火、燬屋兩間、並死一人、傷二人、肇事原因未明、茲將各情探誌於後、</p>
<p>出事地點　廣東街一百八十九號上海市衛生試騐所、係三開間洋房一所、中爲會客室、兩旁爲辦公定、後面又有三層洋房一幢、爲衛生試騐室、其下築有二尺方之地窖一所、專藏各種藥料、爆炸起火、即由該地窖中發生、</p>
<p>爆炸情形　該所在滬戰中曾爲日軍佔據、其左側之岐峯公學、曾設日軍司令部、十七日始經接收、該所遷入、才數百耳、現正在修繕、昨日上午、雇有北四川路順泰電料公司工匠干富貴在該所後樓下修理電燈、十一時五十分許、突聞轟然一聲、自屋底地窖下發出、頓時火舌四冒、白烟瀰漫、天花板即時炸穿、屋中各處及天井之玻璃天幔、均被震破、其聲甚大、遠近皆聞、爆炸時電燈匠被震受傷、於門外、爲人救出、該所會計員王敬身、適過該屋門前、亦被炸受傷、全身血跡、倒於門外、不省人事、更有該所茶役毛福海、適在樓上、樓板炸破、即堕入火穴、被焚斃命、</p>
<p>努力灌救　該所人員、聞聲紛向各處報警、閘北救火會及租界救火車、於下午一時陸續趕到、努力灌救、二時火滅、並於餘燼中、將茶役屍體扒出、置於後門外、候法院檢騐後收殮、</p>
<p>原因待查　該所爆炸起火原因、雖經救火會多方調查、但尚不能確定、或係修理電燈不愼起火、而延及地窖下所藏之伊打酒（Ｅtheralcohol）而爆發、或戰事中有彈丸遺留而致炸爆、總之在起火之前、有轟炸之聲甚巨、其爆力亦大、屋底之水泥地、竟炸起一大塊、樓板亦頓炸落、上下兩層相通、該所定於今日請專家詳細檢查、究竟係地雷爆發、抑或有其他原因、</p>
<p>一死兩傷　事後調查、該所茶役毛福海、年三十二歲、常州人、當塲炸斃、上肢炸去、下肢僅餘大小腿、滿身魚黑、腹破腸出、面目亦已炸去、存一駕黑之骷髏、死狀極慘、會計員王敬身、年三十三歲、錫人、面部傷勢頗重、工匠干富貴、年十六歲、上身微傷、均在仁濟醫院醫治、據該院醫生語記者、兩人傷勢雖重、尙無生命之虞、</p>
<p>善後事宜　衛生試騐所所長、於出事後即電逹常州死者家屬、五時上海地方法院派楊檢察官到出事地點檢騐後收殮、至受傷之會計員王敬身、則在仁濟醫院二百八十四號病房醫治、并由試騐所醫生孫鳴岐女士隨院看護、</p>
<p>五區報告　記者至五區二分所詢問、據云、上午十一時五十分、第二十九號崗警朱殿瑞聞炸聲後、即往出事地點察看、旋即返所報告、當由所長牛精發偕同巡官程衍昆、前往視察一週、呈報公安局、至衛生試騐所損失、尙未詳計、藥品一項、約損失二千餘元、</p>
<h3>内河輪衰落將移湘開新班</h3>
<p>受戰事之影響最烈</p>
<p>公路告成營業衰落</p>
<p>招商局另謀新出路</p>
<p>擬在湖南計劃航綫</p>
<p>京滬路通車後、内河小輪營業、一落千丈、又加以江浙各地公路告成、小火輪更難存在、故滬上内河輪有移湘開關新地盤之舉、亟將調查所知、詳誌如下、</p>
<p>戰後無法復班　上年江蘇大水、内河輪曾停業二個多月、今春又遭日宼淞滬、申蘇綫内雖有一時期、旅客營　甚佳、但其他各路則全行停航、得不償失、台京滬路通車之後、内河輪照例可復原狀、但蘇屬各地航綫、受軍運戰後等影響、竟至不能復班、而各輪局之小輪、十八九皆空停不開、</p>
<p>公路陸續告成　江浙兩省所造之公路、已陸續告成、江陰至無錫一路、昔日全賴小輪維持交通者、今澄錫公路已經通車、旅費廉而時間速、人民均棄舟就陸、致各輪局之錫澄班輪祗得停航、又蘇常一路亦賴小輪運輸者、今此綫公路、由十九路軍一星期内造就、九月内亦可通車、届時小輪亦惟有撤班、其他凡通航之處、無一不建公路、以後内河輪船、將完全受時代的淘汰、</p>
<p>主要路無貨客　滬埠内河輪局、以招商爲最大、有二十六條航路、餘爲源通·慶記·立興等局、而各局的主要航路、爲申蘇·申杭·申湖·及申錫等路、戰後各該路之旅客、可稱完全無有乘搭、貨運則受市面之影響、五月底結賬的關係、亦無儎脚、每開一班、無論任何路綫、所得客貨水脚、不敷燃煤之用、且無希望興發、</p>
<p>湘省禁航外輪　日商戴生昌、在上海航業、已確售與華人接辦、在湖南方面、則仍歸日人自辦、湘省省黨部查明此事、已請湖南省政府下令禁止、業將戴生昌在湘之航行權撤消、並將其碼頭棧房與航輪等完全收買、不許日輪再在湘省内地行駛、此案業已根本解决、</p>
<p>滬輪移湘開班　内河招商局受江浙公路之打擊、使全部航業、陷於無法維持之境、該局連日討論另謀新計劃、别闢新路綫的辦法、磋商結果、認定祗有將江浙各路小輪移往湖南開班爲最佳的出路、因湘中盡是水道、現當日輪停航之時、爲最佳的機會、該局已經决定特派專員多人、親往湖南、計劃新路、並與湖南省當局接洽移航等手續矣、</p>
<h3>吳淞鐵路機廠汚臭佈滿全廠</h3>
<p>勘察員觸汚斃命</p>
<p>淞南張華浜鐵路總機廠、自中日戰事發生後、爲日本陸軍設司令部於内、因此軍隊往來、以該廠爲根據之所、人數旣多、管理不易、以致汚穢叢生、大小便溺、滿廠皆是、甚至死人屍體及腐爛牲畜等、穢臭異常、自本月二日日軍撤退後、路局因機件損壞及缺少者、損失重大、遂派令銅匠間領班王財金（甬人年四十餘歳）到廠察勘、詎王領班進廠時、即被汚臭觸動腦海、當即昏倒、不省人事、旋即經人扶送回家、當晚不待天明、竟穢毒暴發而斃、據稱王領班身軀强壯、精神飽滿、作事亦頗精幹、故深得上司所信任、此次死於汚毒之間、甚爲可惜、路局方面因廠内汚臭滿佈、在廠内辦公之材料處·機務處等各部職員、因以前所存各部文卷及圖様底冊簿據案稿等、均已遺失、刻下忙於整理進廠工作、於衛生上大有關係、况且天將炎夏、疫癘傳染、更須預防、現今路局已派員將廠内各部先行設法消毒烘洗穢臭、一面趕辦嘴套一千餘隻、發給在廠各員　司及工匠人等應用、以重衛生而免瘟疫、</p>
<h3>浦江内荷輪失愼</h3>
<p>損的數目尙未查悉</p>
<p>貨物一部分受水漬</p>
<p>本埠荷商渣華輪船公司之貨輪塞洛斯扣克號Slrooskerk、此次由荷蘭之鹿透丹、經德國享寳運貨到滬、停在浦東藍烟囱碼頭、昨晨突然失火、損失頗大、茲將調查所得、分記如下、</p>
<p>卸貨　渣華公司經理荷蘭航業公司之東亞班貨輪塞洛斯扣克號、自鹿透丹阿姆斯透丹等埠裝載大批貨物到上海、於十九日上午進口、該輪停在浦東英商老太古公司之藍烟囱碼頭（俗稱唖子碼頭）、起卸貨件、船内所裝至上海之進口貨以五金紙頭顔料與洋雜貨等項、均起存在該碼頭棧房中、昨晨正在啓艙工作、突告失愼、而延燒頗烈、</p>
<p>失愼　該侀兼往東洋、在荷蘭出口時、將貨物分艙堆運、往日本之貨、多在後艙之内、其貨艙中有硝磺一批、最易肇禍者、昨日上午七時、該艙正值開艙出貨之際、其所裝之硝磺内、突然起火冒烟、霎時已經火燄上穿、延燒頗烈、起火原因、雖未查明、但可以推想而知必在硝磺内遺火肇禍也、</p>
<p>救援　火勢冒穿時、船主林奇氏得知、急令全部船員水手人等、迅取船内特備之消防器具、吸水射擊、冀圖撲滅火燄、無如火勢至猛、不能奏效、遂由船主電告滬行、而海關業已得訊、急令救火小輪飛往藍烟囱碼頭恊助救援、帮同射水一面由船主命將未經波及之各貨艙、設法封閉、加以隔離、以保未卸之貨、</p>
<p>損失　延燒至下午、尙有餘烟未息、故救火小輪仍在射水、所有已經燒去之貨物總數、尙未得知、須澈查之後、方可明白、滬行大班、已令船主查報、其未經延燒者、有一部分、亦受水漬、此項貨物、將來統須辦理攤水、候火息之後、卸上碼頭、由公正人檢騐後再定、目前無法估計損失數額、被燒之艙面等處、損壞甚多、須加修理、該輪原定今日開往東洋及華北、定七月九日再來上海運貨、還荷蘭等埠、</p>

<h3>公共租界五月份衛生工作</h3>
<p>工部局衛生處長五月份報告云、上海之五月、向係最宜於健康之月份、計是月外僑死亡率爲零·一零、（四月一二·三）華人爲一三·六零、（四月爲二零·三零）</p>
<p>本年之霍亂、於四月間、初見於鄰區、五月二日、始見於租界、自一九零二年以來、鮮有如是之早者、查上海冬季、並無是症、而華中地方、則四月間已有之、則是症似係由外埠所傳來、又上年年終報告中、已曾言及、照以往推測、本年將爲霍亂劇烈之年也、計本月中、經報告之數、患者爲外僑一人、華人二十四人、續經調查、連未經報告者、共有五十二人、本年之劇烈如何、未易推論、但查一九零二年死於此者凡一六零人、時則人口爲三十五萬、現今人口爲當年之八倍、而患病及死者之數、則遠不及、是可見預防之已見效果矣、計本月内、打針者凡二七·八五五人、大抵皆工人、</p>
<p>最近十年中、公共租界内平均每年死亡率、每萬人中計肺癆一一·七、天花一·三五、猩紅熱一五五、霍亂一·二、在印度之加而加逹城、則過·去二十年中、最近之霍亂死亡率、爲萬分之七、但預防工作、尙須日進不已、而財政上及工程上之進展、及衛生敎育之分佈、皆先决問題也、天花在五月中更見低減、猩紅熱在四月中、逹最高數、後此即日減退、間歇寒熱、華人中頗有增加、吸血蟲病、又發生一件、</p>
<p>病理研究室、本月收到様件一二一八、爲一最高額、多由於霍亂之暴發、而霍亂注射劑之製造、亦逹六十立特之多、檢騐牛乳中之肺癆菌、亦在進行、</p>

<p>回到廟裏，我就把我所懷疑的一五一十的說出來，請朱先生解釋。朱先生說：「現在政府一面提倡普及敎育，一面小孩子進小學要考，甚至於進幼稚園也要考，這種自相矛盾的政策是應該存在的嗎？我那小弟弟也不見得笨，四年前投考小學居然考不取，我不得已只好在家裏敎他。小學也要過考眞是二十世紀的一個大笑話。我們在這裏辦學决不可以利用入學考試來淘汰小朋友。我們只好來一個收一個，纔算是民國的敎育。假如有人要來學做國民，你說要先考他一下。好，他可以說讓他學好了再請你考。他或者可以問：「倘使考不取就不必學做國民嗎？」請問你有什麽話回答？你說經費不足，先生不夠，課堂容不下。他可以說考得取的固然不會做國民，考不取的是格外不會做國民，那末考不取的小孩子是應該儘先入學，你又有什麽話回答？我們抱着一個「來者不拒」的態度便没有這個矛盾了。而且我辦學堂如同韓信點兵，多多益善。你怕我一個人幹不了，這固然說得有理，但是村莊裏有的是人，何止我一個？我現在問你，「我一個人敎十個人，行不行？」「那怎麽不行？」「如果十個人在前一點鐘學會做一件事，後一點鐘就拿這件事再去每人敎十人，行不行？」「這行！」「好，這様一人敎十人，十人敎百人，百人敎千人，並不是不可能。你只須看那最好的軍隊裏，軍長，師長，旅長，團長，營長，連長，排長，士兵一貫的訓練下去，就知道我這個意思是可以實現的。我把我心裏的辦法告訴你吧。我要先招先生，後招學生，其實我是要先招大徒弟，後招小徒弟。我的辦法是：師傅敎大徒弟，大徒弟敎小徒弟。這也没有說得十分恰當。我實在是要敎大徒弟去敎小徒弟去自己敎自己。對了，這句話才把我的意思充分的發揮出來。現在離開學還有好多天，你可以帶我去會會村裏的小朋友大朋友。同時也可以請他們隨時到我們古廟裏來玩玩談談，這様在開學之前我便可以認識誰能做大徒弟。找着了幾位師傅，幾十位大徒弟，我們便能從整個村莊的生活裏辦出整個村莊的敎育來，鐘兒！你在大徒弟當中算是頂大的了。但是，你要明白，我不一定的師傅；師傅不一定是我。」</p>
<h3>滬體育記者歡送宴中沈嗣良發表重要意見</h3>
<p>赴美職務有三丨純以國民資格出席</p>
<p>僞國參加大會丨决定暫時置之不理</p>
<p>丨對於全國體育會議發表五年計劃意見丨</p>
<p>中華全國體育恊進會名譽主任戟事約翰大學副校長沈嗣良君、將於本月二十四日乘柯立芝總統號赴美、出席第十屆世界亞林比克運動大會、上海各報體育記者、爲表示歡送起見、昨晚七時設宴鄧脱摩飯店餞行、到新聞報裴順元、時事新報會衍華、時報滕樹榖、及申報馬崇淦·孫道勝·蔣槐靑·沈鎭潮等、陵翔千作陪、席間言笑甚歡、而對於吾國體育前途、無限希望中、亦具不少感喟也、</p>
<h3>水酒一杯祝君安去</h3>
<p>馬君崇淦首起述歡送之詞、謂沈君萬里渡重洋、將代表吾國出席世界運動會、切望屆時將有以世界體育進步之大勢、歸告吾人、茲謹以水酒一杯、祝沈君一帆風順、沈君乃繼起作談話、語多重要、尤多爲吾人所急欲知者、記述如次、</p>
<h3>熟慮之後去美意决</h3>
<p>余（沈君自謂）此次赴美、困難良多、而不能率吾國選手以去、尤爲抱憾、各方責難亦有之、最近因僞國之傳聞將參加大會、更有告余弗去者、惟熟慮後、因僞國之參加、我國竟代表一人而不去、果於吾國有利益乎、旣無利益、去美之意乃决</p>
<h3>赴美之任務共有三</h3>
<p>余之赴美、任務有三（一）以會員國資格、代表中華全國體育恊進會董事長王儒堂先生出席大會執行委員會（二）出席世界體育會議、大會時將集世界體育專家討論改進實施世界平民體育之方案、（三）參觀此次大會、同時亦得晤見在美之親友</p>
<h3>僞國參加暫置不理</h3>
<p>關於僞國之參加大會、近屢有詢余如何意見及措置者、本欲電大會詢問眞相、因電問恊進會董事長王儒堂先生及會長張伯苓先生、二君電覆、謂可置之不理、或係日人之宣傳、吾國如果因此而惶惶恐懼、反露柔弱、而中日人之奸計、待其果眞參加後、再定步驟、</p>
<h3>照會章無出席資格</h3>
<p>世界運動會之競爭選手、必須由該國爲衆所承認之體育恊會、證明其業餘資格等等、方可出席、故僞國之選手、亦必須經恊進會之證明、該僞國旣未有承認之業餘體育恊會之組織、則不能爲大會會員、更參加大會亦談不到矣、</p>
<h3>大會或許遷就日人</h3>
<p>至於印度菲律賓之前例、印菲亦各有其承認之業餘體育恊會、惟僞國由日本人爲報名、大會方面或因欲避免日人之生事、遷就之者、亦未可知、果或若是、執委會中、自當盡力抗議、成效如何、不可預計矣、</p>
<h3>須由外交當局解决</h3>
<p>果如日人之宣傳、于劉二君或因種種不得已、或被迫而不得不往者、其一行一止、自將受日人之處處監視、趣味若何、亦可想見、至於僞國國旗果見於大會塲中、此則爲侮辱吾國之外交案、須由外交當局交涉解决矣、</p>
<h3>純以國民資格赴美</h3>
<p>余之赴美、純以國民資格、亦未受國民政府之絲毫津貼、惟旅費則由恊進會任之、數約五千、初恊進會曾以呈文呈行政院、以大會關係國際地位、請派代表出席、行政院以此咨敎育部、敎部乃有以時間怱促不參加之明令、實則國府代表、即電該地領事出席、亦無不可也、</p>
<h3>全國體育會議意見</h3>
<p>最後關於即將舉行之全國體育會議、鄙意以爲坐言不如立行、中國之體育、須從根本着手、對外比賽、大可暫停、而努力從小學做起、五年之後、其效必見、恊進會爲民衆體育組織、對於體育會議、僅居備咨詢貢獻意見之地位而已、</p>
<h3>將於九月中旬返滬</h3>
<p>沈君爲時間所限、語止於此、聞同行者、尙有申國權君、作蜜月旅行也、沈君將於九月十五日歸抵滬上、</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<p>九三老人馬相伯語录</p>
<h3>同聲相應，同氣相求。</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>這幾天，吾病得很厲害，接到仲淵來信的時候，恰巧吾的精神漸斬恢復，而仲淵那種好學的精神，活躍在字裏行間，越加使吾歡喜。</p>
<p>「琥珀拾介」這名話是吾在易經裏看得來的。吾所讀的是唐孔穎逹正義，魏王弼注的易經。在易經乾傳章裏有：</p>
<p>「同聲相應，同氣相求······」</p>
<p>其下有注：</p>
<p>「······非惟同類相感，亦有異類相感者，若磁石引針，琥珀拾芥······」</p>
<p>這個注脚出於魏時王弼之手，離漢代不遠；而且「磁石引針，琥珀拾芥」等話頭，或許是當時代父老相傳的經騐之談，决不是到了魏時王弼才發現的。吾料想王弼讀到了「同聲相應，同氣相求」句，聯想到「異類相感」的事實，而以當時一般人司空見慣的經騐提出來做證據，所以吾測斷這「琥珀拾芥」的話是在漢時就發現的。</p>
<p>中國人老早就發現了這些事實，而不知道做深一層的研究，結果「磁石引針，琥珀拾芥」始終成了老古話，直到西洋科學智識灌輸到中國以後，才覺悟這些老古話裏實隠藏著科學的原理。</p>
<h3>體育表演記</h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>年年榴花紅時。海上各體育學校。例開盛大運動會。今夏固不以戰事影響而稍减勇氣。六月十八日。克尼異體育館聯合其他體校。假中央運動塲舉行體育表演。中西觀衆。多如朿筍。節目凡十七。秩序支配殊欠調劑。券價貴至二元。誠非普羅階級所能欣賞。東南中國二校之楊家棍·木棒操·功力拳·劍舞·游戲。每個學生均具運動機會。的爲學校體操課之良善敎材。平民化之普遍體育。危邦弱國。尤屬急要。不觀蘇俄對工農·靑年·兒童强迫體育乎。其比賽側重於參加人數之衆多。輕視少數人之優異成績。列寗謂「體育操諸無產階級手中。乃有力之兵器也」。被壓迫民族其聽諸。其聽諸。</p>
<p>姑娘選手。僉白衣。黑褲。軟底鞋。短統襪。脛腿全露。縷縷靑絲截短披覆。粉白項頸畢呈。此一九三二年最摩登之式様也。指導陳詠聲杜飛宇兩女士旣活潑又熱沈。發號司令。聲若鐘磬。全塲可聞。秦家姊妹志學志道。娉娉嫋嫋。衣短袖長旗袍。表演中國古舞。配以西樂。頗稱别致。輕歌慢舞。翩翩如蝶。惟玉臂顫動。終不若長袖仙袂之得體。</p>
<p>西洋拳術比賽。華人亦告奮勇參加。成績較往年市運動會進步多多。奈身小肌瘦。不無感慨。號稱丈夫之中華民族。視歷史上矮種之今日撒克遜與大和民族。行將望塵莫及矣。社稷衰頽。非偶然也。最後一幕希臘羅馬角力。竟演悲劇。美國第四隊海軍軍官奈生却里被體重三百鎊胖子裴喬治甩擲墊外水門汀硬地。當時左頸流血。小腦受傷。二十餘年辛苦練習。毁損一旦。遂急延醫診治。據張森玉醫師謂。生命可保無虞。同時裁判宣佈錦標由美海軍官奪得。所以爲犯規不道德者戒焉。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>全國呼籲廢止内戰聲中，而廣東二陳交　的慘劇，已擺佈在我們的眼前了。雖經各方奔走調停，終未能化干戈爲玉帛。我們且不管誰是誰非，但在這亡國減種的生死關頭，發現此類不愛國家，不恤民命的國賊，論其萬惡罪狀，眞該爲全民所唾棄！</p>
<p>我們的中樞，如其能行使職權的話，那末中央執委監委早就應當嚴行訓斥，國府應明令處分；軍委會應通令制止；監察院應依法彈劾；然而當局始終不問不聞，一任其自然推移，終致事態惡化。若提起「黨紀國法」，眞是不可說，不忍說！</p>
<h3>記鮑心荃女士個人畫展</h3>
<p>— 石伽寄自杭州</p>
<p>西子湖畔。自暮春以來。書畫展覽。風起雲湧。初中國畫展及西冷書畫社第九屆畫展。繼則香祖畫展。月之十三日。鮑女士心荃復集個人作品。假國貨陳列館公開展覽。伽值養疴故鄕。得參盛會。且女士本爲西泠同社。韶華草草。一别六年。今日重見故人。其藝竟大成。歡慰之餘。爰濡筆記之。</p>
<p>女士初列吾杭老畫師武苦髯門牆。寫花卉。魄力雄厚。别具墨韻。後遊滬。畢業於美專。問道於白龍山人。其畫遂直逼缶老。粗枝大葉。不類閨秀手筆。書法出入顔蘇。尤擅石鼓。入鄧石如室。伽識女界擅書畫者甚夥。如鮑女士。洵爲異才。</p>
<p>此次出品逹二百餘件。畫以松菊爲最臻上乘。中有八尺横幅古松。盤曲顧盼。氣韻生動。嘗聞參觀者謂如許大輻。不知一弱女子從何下筆。而竟能脱盡脂粉氣。實所罕見。古松之外。有紫藤蠂花金萱牡丹。均得來賓欣賞。</p>
<p>會塲設該館花園樓上。雕欄畫軸。曲折相眏。畫幅占十分之六。其他書法及扇面配合其間。色調至爲雅艶。瀏覽其間。不覺目倦。惜會之次日。風雨爲愁。某顧曲家謂「雨絲風片。烟波畫船。」蓋女士所佈置。已入詞境矣。</p>
<p>會期凡三日。來賓約四五千人。鮑女士於稠人中往來招待。備極辛勤。其尊人鮑廉澂剌史。精神　鑠。時與名印家韓登　談藝。至爲詳盡。則知女士之成。亦淵源家學所致耳。（却酬）</p>
<h3>英人之男女觀</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>英人之無子女者。多就所謂螟蛉會者領之。年來領女孩者。紛至沓來。須先掛號。久始得之。據倫敦螟蛉會名譽書記白特爾敎士曁全國螟蛉會名譽書記白萊克本女士曰。今日男孩待領者頗多。而待領女孩者更多。上年請領女孩者。較男孩爲三與一之比。其緣因殆由不望自生子女者。多覺子之爲子。至娶婦而止。女之爲女。則延及終身。雖女大須嫁。亦不之計也。另一緣因。則爲許多夫婦。在歐戰中喪其唯一之愛子。已感至痛。今螟蛉一子。將來長成。或不免仍死疆塲。則不堪再負此痛。領孩者頗多表示此種感想。再則。領孩者多有爲退職女校長。平日爲兒童所包圍。洞逹男女孩之性格。多覺女孩視男孩爲温柔。更有無兒之家。覺他日女孩長成。可爲其婦老來之伴侶。有此數因。女孩乃彌覺可貴矣。按我華向來重男輕女。今英人乃適與相反。而子之爲子。至娶婦而止一言。又與我華娶了媳婦。賣掉兒子之俗諺。翕然吻合。亦云異已。</p>
<h3>新軍器譜（上）</h3>
<p>— ·鐵·彌·陀</p>
<p>余讀墨子備城門以下十一篇。言攻守器械。皆有尺寸。墨子言弭兵。兵不可以空言弭也。故必有備。自古言軍械機關之積。未有若墨子者也。婁欲比而譜之。益以歷代軍器。爲軍器譜。人事樄檖。因循未果。嘗怪吾國譜錄家。農器有譜。草木有譜。雜器有譜。而無及軍器者。雖有刀劍錄等。則徒侈弔詭而已。蓋武事之不講。戰器之不明。其來已久。宜召外侮之來矣。今年春。得讀胡君一臧滬戰與軍器一文。嘆其周密詳盡。能得墨子之遺意。第胡君只述列國。不數家珍。我國雖少發明。然自國難以來。有志之士。亦間有發憤創造者。因效　胡君竊取墨子之旨。作新軍器譜。爲他日作軍器譜之嚆矢。亦且以勵國之創造者。</p>
<p>防空砲</p>
<p>防空砲爲東北兵工廠廠員蓋君唯心所發明。口徑四十生的邁當。身袤一百二十生的邁當。重六十有二磅。直射九秒鐘可逹三千五百邁當。平射又過之。逹四千邁當有强。機括宛轉。平直如意。彈爲披甲着發然燒三種。射逹二千五百邁當以外。能不觸物而爆發。曾試騐於北平。有奇績。原料皆取國服。不仰給於外來。每具國幣二百五十鉼。蓋只當外國高射砲價值五十分之一耳。蓋君未嘗學問。皆於經騐中獲之。其他尙有新造槍械五種。皆奇巧適用。手提機關槍尤佳。</p>
<h3>十字街口的音樂</h3>
<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>近來搬居法租界，時常得在霞飛路上閒走，看看清楚，花花世界。我的脾氣有時候特别古怪，我不一定愛在月夜踏月；風雨之夜我也喜歡冒着冷空氣去踱踱，凄清的雨夜，熱昏了的上海市街倒可以得到刹那的安慰。因爲刮風落雨的晚上，迷濛的夜上海，都可換了另一副安靜的面目。如狂的野馬，也得有片時的靜止。</p>
<p>在杭州的時候，我常常喜歡在渍艶的湖濱跟着算命的瞎子在苦雨中領略他們的三弦；因爲從他們悲苦凄咽的弦聲中，我可以領悟出人生的眞諦。他們自己背上悲苦的命運，專門去替人家推测禍福，這正是滑稽矛盾的人生。其次，他們的調子也彈得實在太動人了。嫻熟的彈撥，奏出旋律般自然的節奏。這是人類的命運和瞎子的運程的交響曲。</p>
<p>到上海以後，瞎子的三弦是不像杭州那末的普遍在街頭巷尾。平常聽到的，大多是些下流的亡國之音！漸漸地，我把瞎子們苦雨的悲歌也忘却了。終朝奔走衣食，再也没有聽歌的清興。</p>
<p>昨天偶然又在代替了北四川路繁榮的霞飛路上走。烟霧一様的雨簾織，燈光朦朧地閃射出「不滿足」，那神秘之街是異常的冷落。法租界，丨丨尤其是霞飛路附近的地段，到處都是富人的瓊樓大厦；在地獄上各自各建自己的天堂。汽車的聲音，多麽的誇耀呵？大餐館，影戲園，都是富人們滿足之地。</p>
<p>但是，我在那兒，聽到了人間最悲切感人的哀歌。不是碧紗窗内玉人玉指按出的琴韻，也不是舞塲歌榭透出來的弦歌。那三春的鵑泣也似地，午夜黄　輕囀般的，充實生命的活力，唱出了人間的不平，缺憾，仇怒，一個白俄的浪人在街上踏著風雨，展開他額上的縐紋在呌，在嘶，鳴咽地，凄酸地，代替赤俄的伏爾加的船夫。</p>
<p>雨是不停的洒落，他的歌聲像愛的𦆑�</p>
<p>大踏步地向前行。他唱的歌詞我全不理解，但那悲凉的歌聲悠揚得像深溪的流水，潺潺的，鏗鏘的，在微風中打滾。他唱出他的飄蓬遭遇，唱出人間的睡眼惺忪；天籟似的，廻旋在空間，留傳在我的記憶裏。他的音波是淡遠了，然而我還是痴楞的，木立在風雨蒼茫之中追味。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記　（八五）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第十回　權門綱紀欺凌賴有閨人慰藉</p>
<p>無奈毛德順又那様說。旣是誤會。便當趁早兒說開。你若不收下。回頭恐怕更又誤會你是嫌多嫌少。越發不妙。老弟。你想想。這不又是敎我做了難人了嗎。都是你不該像私訪一般來害了我的。我今天說你該没說錯吧。安玉田初聽他把老弟和小兄弟呌得那様肉麻。不由渾身皮膚上都起了毛栗子。暗想今天花錢買來的玩藝。是變換了一套新様兒善意的侮辱。與昨天的風味。又自有别。不過凛遵著遇事逹觀的閨訓。勉學那逆來順受。漸漸也就相安。等他說完了這些滑腔怪調後。並還期期艾艾回答了些總請處長帮忙務求處長賞收那一類的客氣話。萬金生隨即收回手去。讓安玉田坐下。高喊著小三兒沏茶拿烟。殷勤欵待。及毛德順代問起大帥現時可否就見。才又坐在藤椅上笑說道。頭兒剛到簽押房。稍停一刻兒就可上去。本來安老弟的事。也就是八小姐的事。頭兒尙且另眼相看。我只從旁多少照應一點。實在不算什麽。等將來辦成功後我討喜酒喝罷。說著。從口袋裏取出那兩張支票。假意兒推來塞去的仍要壁還。安玉田免不了也須奉陪他落力串演這幕滑稽劇。終於又撑拒著仍送進他的口袋。還有毛德順從旁咕啜。也是帮著安玉田一鼻孔出氣。萬金生看看已到了天與人歸的成熟時期。這才含笑打拱的說道。没法子。我就謝謝罷。好在安老弟極漂亮。彼此又都是自己人。一定清楚這不是我個人的事。處裏好幾十同事的人。連同上面跑上房的和一應老媽子丫頭人等。全都指望著大家攤分。每到節邊。我這個人公事公辦。還得開出總賬來呈給頭兒過一過目。是毫没半點私弊和啊。說到這裏。想起當下應見見顔色。就再立起來揭開門帘向外問道。那一個值日。旋見另一個少校承啓宜走來答應道。是我。有事嗎。萬金生便大聲吩咐道。安參議送你們大家二百塊錢。在我這裏。你們謝謝吧。現在上頭客還不多。正好領安參議去見見頭兒。也就快去罷。這時。屋中睡覺的人。大半已被他們說話聲吵醒。一個個都伏在枕邊目光灼灼的向安玉田看著。</p>

<h3>厘拆仍趨殆狀</h3>
<p>銀洋收解較繁</p>
<p>市塲槪况　連日厘市氣象時有盤旋、縱無重大軒輊、但形勢終屬於疲頽、未能有進展希冀、是以一漲一跌、毫無新頴狀態、其他銀根趨勢、依然堅滯不常、就大體上觀察、似無好象可言、目前洋銷胃及銀需要如是冷淡、焉得有大好景氣耶、查昨日市况、依然下游、殆即此故、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　「洋厘」早市賣氣又覺奮勇、人心遂趨下游、較前日午市改小半厘、爲六錢九分三厘二毫半、午市更爲軟滯、而買户益懈、卒至較早市賡續回跌一厘、爲六錢九分二厘二毫半、「銀拆」早午市同爲八分、較前日復弱二分、形勢外表似軟、但内幕尙覺堅緊、故劃頭加水驟爾昂至一錢三四分、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋、經前午跌後、昨日未有更動、計早午市同爲五錢九分九厘、交易祗早市二千角、廣東小洋、早市爲五錢八分六厘半、較前日遽小一厘半、午市略回半厘、爲五錢八分七厘、交易早市二十六萬角、午市七萬角、銅元改縮一千文、爲四百十七千文、交易三萬二千餘串文、</p>
<p>銀洋進出　「銀欵」昨值星期一、銀行開關、故收解較旺、計華商收解票欵二百三四十萬、外商收解票欵二百四十餘萬、各種貨滙税　諸欵收解一千零九十餘萬、進倉一百十萬、錢莊銀公單收解二千七百餘萬、劃頭欵收解四百六十餘萬、各路匯欵收解七十餘萬、解現一百餘萬、拆票交易四百六七十萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵早市做出八十四萬五千、鈔票六萬五千、午市滙劃票欵做出五十四萬、鈔票一萬五千、又塲外鈔票早市十二萬、午市四萬、銀行交易、早市七十五萬、午市五十萬、錢莊洋公單收解五百九十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百三十餘萬、拆借洋欵一百五十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出一百五六十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百五十餘萬、小錢莊交易六十餘萬、</p>
<h3>銀錢業放欵困難</h3>
<p>銀錢業自五底結束後、本月（六月）份中、本可從事擴充、以冀收補救上半年盈利之效、結果心與願違、滿腔希望、頓失憑籍、而作淡然之漠視、據深悉内幕者言、銀行方面、現在一般華商銀行、其營業計劃、與錢莊大都類似、向亦恃放欵爲唯一營利之淵藪、今年因上屆結束時、都半結而未清、舊逋未償、新欠當然中止進行、職是放欵營業、向恃爲淵藪者、今失其效用、全仗押欵滙兌或證券投資等貿易、當然無向持者之有味、錢莊更爲困難、蓋性質與銀行有别、放賬格外謹愼、故目前除老户頭或存户、照舊開摺外、其他各商店、欲求一摺之往來、殊難覔得、　論通融調劑焉、</p>
<h3>證劵債價回漲六七角</h3>
<p>買氣活潑成交五百六十餘萬</p>
<p>昨（二十日）華商證券交易所各債市况、現貨進出稀少、全日祗開出一萬八千元、期市則價忽上漲、市塲賣買人氣活潑、計上下午成交五百六十五萬五千元、其中鹽税佔一百三十八萬五千、統税·二○　均近一百萬元、二○開七十四萬其他亦在三十萬左右、惟九六·整六·關税甚清、至言各債券價之趨勢、則爲國内局勢、聞有轉機、人心樂觀、賣方觀望、雖買方大户仍未有鉅額成交、而零户投資收進、則甚形活潑、故市面已呈求過於供、債價一致趨漲、結果統鹽税本下月期及二○捲六月載兵七月等各漲九角許、二○關現貨則漲逹一元三角、其他亦好起四五角左右不等、一時市面情形頓頗良好云、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市不堪收拾</h3>
<p>棉紗跌風又起、形勢甚虚、蓋以四圍環境惡劣、各方經濟太枯、而粤省政潮相持不下、致人心愈形不安、現紗銷路岑寂、惟蜀帮尙有零碎進量但大量包額、殊覺缺乏、標紗前市、賡豐長豐兩號大量抛出、傳說係代外商委託、足見世界之紗價、爲低於華紗、所以多數傾向抛賣、四十兩關口、恐難站定也、</p>
<p>人標大户抛賣　人標前市開盤、市氣甚疲、因有大户抛出、各月跌一兩二·三·五·六·錢、午後開盤仍跌、收盤以川帮略有交易、又回漲、結果各跌二·三·錢、全日成交統計二萬九千包、查賣出裕大一千四百包、賡豐一千四百包、森康一千包、長豐二千一百五十包、恊生八百五十包穗隆八百包、買進吉豐一千一百包、裕康九百包、長和一千四百五十包、永大一千零五十包、同和六百包、茲將人標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<h3>棉市又轉下游</h3>
<p>棉市趨疲、跌風又起、因美棉狀况平澹、形勢又轉趨下游、且環境惡化、廠需停滯、而紗價突復暴落、致人心更難安靜、天津棉市消息又有下跌之說、該處銀根大緊、有一部份銀行將押欵之貨、在滬套賣、故市氣愈覺衰敗不振、但申地棉商、仍在多頭地位、拉緊不放、總之世界潮流如此、本棉何能獨堅也、前途狀况、實不敢逆料、</p>
<p>鄭標一跌五錢　鄭標前午開盤、以美棉疲　塲中人氣又虚、各月跌三四錢、午後又跌一錢、全日成交統計四萬一千九百擔、查賣出大孚三千一百擔、恒益一千擔、長和一千四百擔、同美一千二百擔、　餘一千五百擔、買進　成一千四百擔、大昶一千二百擔、益豐一千四百擔、賡豐一千八百擔、茲將鄭標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<h3>津棉市跌風愈厲西河花開二十一兩半</h3>
<p>津訊（十六日）西河花市况跌風愈厲、銷路仍無大批活動、日商三昌行買進二百包、開價二十一兩五錢、較前又暴跌二兩、聞該處存棉亦豐厚、約有二百萬包之巨、棉商倒閉甚多、金融界大爲損失、銀行方面、吃虧二百餘萬兩云、</p>
<h3>糧食米市到銷二淡</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日米市、各帮來源十七八號、惟浦存仍夥、城鄕店銷有限、厚粳新鮮定局、中關疲落一二角、薄稻來貨略稀、零碎走動三四百石、價照前盤、洋蘆尖及變陰元無榮辱、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日西路到頭約念五六號、本街交易不見十分活動、早晨常錫北粳開盤、項緊次中略軟、早晚稻及飛來鳳客帮辦去近千石、價緊角許河下斛脚式千石左右、</p>
<h3>洋米步趨步下</h3>
<p>昨日較跌角許</p>
<p>昨日洋米愈見不振、小絞米存到兩多、存底已有一百卅萬包以上、加之其他存米、總數存積更鉅、連日消化平淡、每况愈下、昨日高小絞已至十元、中次者小至九元八角、較上週末又小角許、統市由南京帮辦去小絞一千包、内地帮辦去陳糙小絞二百包外、其伅交易均淡、本街鄕莊散户續有應酬、統市開出小絞三千包、價十元至九元八角、一號西貢五百包、價十一元四角半、陳小絞糙二百包、價八元八角半、紅小絞四百包、價九元三角半、較前市各小一角有零云、</p>
<h3>南京秈新有小數到埠</h3>
<p>本市自洋米旺到後、價格低廉、各路客秈均難合　、販户絕跡、存到兩乏、市上祗有洋米撑撑市面、今年客秈來源除温台州尙有裝到外、其他祗米廠自己辦裝少數皖米、客元亦無多數抵埠南京機秈久無見市、昨由行家試裝百餘包到申、曾在市上兜賣、以議價未妥、致未成交云、</p>
<h3>八月份標粉可抽現貨</h3>
<p>廠家維持之苦心</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後各月份以洋麥報價、仍小一二三角左右、致人心又不穏定、各月份開價曾較前週末跌一分左右、惟至二盤以後、忽呈漲風、較初開有二三分之漲度、傳福新之現粉、仍須九錢半扣、惟客帮如抽買八月份、則亦可掉取現貨、而八月份標準、因之地位轉俏、不過目下時值六月、廠方則可抽買八月、事出例外、未免使人疑慮也、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易轉暢、市氣則五有盤旋、較上午回跌一分、因此種一時之興奮、如實銷仍難繼起、不免仍趨疲落也、結果七月份較前週末好二厘半、八月份好七厘半、九月份好五厘、十月份好七厘半、十一月份好二厘半云、</p>
<h3>標麥午後一度回好</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份仍見平定、交易亦寂莫異常、因洋麥重報價小、買氣自愈不定也、迨至下午開盤、市氣轉旺、因上午粉市之回漲、買方不免聯帶提振、較之上午收價、計好三四分不等、惟　花一現、後仍低落、良因内地麥價仍宜、套賣合算耳、結果七月份較前週好一分、八月份不動、九十月份好二分、十一月份好五分、現麥因廠胃不動、又無見交云、</p>
<h3>絲茶珍眉綠茶已有動機</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市　屯溪婺源歙縣等路之珍眉綠茶、英莊錦隆怡和等行、均起動辦、婺東珍眉、開出九十八兩、屯溪貨開出九·十一二兩、徽州貨開出八十五兩、市面已有發展之趨勢、蓋現下茶價低落已臻極點、國外亦有來電需求、是以綠茶市况、轉趨活躍、惟祁寗紅茶、昨市並無大宗交易、花香一項、俄國恊助會、聞已還盤十二三兩、但新價尙未開出云、</p>
<h3>紐約絲電仍鮮轉滬</h3>
<p>里昂實銷曇花一現</p>
<p>國户希望廉價囤積</p>
<p>本埠洋莊絲市、白廠經等現貨法銷曾一度轉暢、奈海外日絲競銷仍力、滬市幾若曇花一現、又告沈靜、法莊囤户、對於期絲希望廉價囤積、以待時機、善價出售、而華商絲本不廉、殊難承抛、紐約上週發往之絲電、因大宗日絲進口、轉滬寥落、且來價不高、華絲商態度堅挺、成交有待、洋莊絲市前途、仍難樂觀云、</p>
<h3>疋頭灰色嗶嘰軋缺轉俏</h3>
<p>昨日毛貨呢羢市面、略見轉機、公會上趨勢稍佳、直貢·華特呢·嗶嘰·巧克丁、川北帮俱有進胃、紗斜膠布·黄斜紋·巴勒呢·胖别取·白嗶嘰·白直貢等、本街洋服帮亦有需辦、大路之灰色素嗶嘰、舊年極爲衰淡、今則反爲轉俏蓋市存希薄、到貨缺乏、客方忽起採購、因之趨勢、突形轉俏、市氣進步不少云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白回漲頗厲</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤交易更盛、市氣頗秀、價以步漲、荷糖二十四號粗砂白初市高貨成交價自十三兩九錢二分至九錢半、需要尙湧、普通貨價自十三兩九錢至二分半、後市更升至十三兩九錢半、香港貨十三兩七錢半至七分半、進出暢旺、市形均俏、八號荷赤九兩七錢、九號貨九兩九錢半、趨勢亦挺、太古糖交易仍寥、B嘜十六兩一錢、CW嘜十五兩九錢、H嘜十二兩四錢半、市象堅穏、號盤有大昌開出現貨八號荷赤五百袋、價九兩六錢半、禎祥售出香港粗砂白二千袋、價十三兩七錢、華新售開原來粗砂白一千七百袋、價爲十三兩九錢半、行方進意殊濃、故市形俏秀、尙具逐升之跡云、</p>
<h3>五金法西釘跌價錢許</h3>
<p>法西釘交易、近來異常蕭條、蓋外埠各帮多購辦本廠釘、而本街建築帮等亦實用國產貨、是以法西釘生意大爲冷落、標準步步下游、昨市開價每桶祗七兩七錢半、比前又跌錢許、惟供多求少、市象停頓、人心衰弱、致行情一節、大有繼續不振之勢、惟小花色如三分至六分、因本廠貨尙少出品、所以行情較爲良佳、如三分估十二兩、四分十二兩五錢、五分十二兩二錢半、六分十二兩、交易則尙可差强人意、聞昨成出百餘桶、係長江福建諸帮辦去云、</p>

<h3>土耳其的藍鬚客</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>十六日君士坦丁電，土耳其大盜奥法秦希姆，今日由其第十二新婚婦，向警署告發後，在其家地窖内就逮，並在窖中搜出至少有十一婦女的肢體，該盜在警署供認，專事誘騙婦女，佯允婚娶，乘間誘至家中，迫其獻出銀錢首飾後，即加殺害云云，</p>
<p>這顯然的是一個外國的大拆白黨了，我國雖也有此類拆白黨人，但手段尙無這様地酷辣，他們惟一的目的，祇在金錢，姦汚尙是他們的手段，故其目的逹到後，或則逃之夭夭，甚則販女爲娼，而殺害的事，尙少見聞，</p>
<p>據該盜供稱，渠殺人之行爲，由於嗜讀法國大盜藍鬚客藍特魯小史所造成，於此可見稗官野史魔力的偉大，而著作者不可不審愼出之，例如近日風行劍俠小說，即有某處米行學徒四人，潛行出外，訪道尋師等異想天開的事實發現，即電影也是如此，在著者演者，全憑理想的搆造，五花八門，空中樓閣，而腦盘簡單思想活動的少年，往往信以爲眞，則其遺害靑年，造惡社會，將不可勝言矣，</p>
<p>或者說武俠小說丨不但武俠小說丨我國本來有此書籍，何以從前不造成罪惡，現在便搆成罪惡呢，不知從前靑年，在舊禮敎束握之下，即有思想，亦不敢貿然一試，現舊禮敎旣經打破，諸靑年多敢作敢爲，勇於一試，這種思想，本來不是壞的現象，原是好的現象，思想的進步，原在這個地方，但現在一般靑年，往往好的地方不學，而專學壞的地方，所以成功了開倒車的進化，到是十二分的可憂呢，</p>

<h3>苑將軍歌</h3>
<p>— 夢苕盦主</p>
<p>去歲暴日宼黑，興安嶺屯墾軍苑旅長崇榖，率所部砲兵赴援，渡河時，砲彈不能經水，縛頂上以濟，河冰劙骨，士無完膚，余聞而感嘆，爲作歌，</p>
<p>君不見危峰積雪白入天，千古萬古無人烟，下有不測蛟龍淵，錢甲如山砑冰走，將軍此去逐天狗，健兒奮臂相先後，中流人影無尺高，頭如霜葉冰如刀，鐵彈壓頂色不撓，十生九死渡此水，登岸想看幾完體，將軍一呼蹶仍起，明朝殺賊江橋來，萬砲如雷轟天開，紛紛虜騎顚塵埃，捷報傳來震朝野，論功獨說龍江馬，將軍之功豈在下，忠肝義膽皆絕倫，能令鼠輩驚天神，始知東北非無人，將軍更是人中傑，佇看功成播英烈，百鍊干將鑄我筆，</p>

<h3>鮮菓保存法</h3>
<p>— 陶小桃</p>
<p>平常的鮮菓，只能放置數天，放置的時候多就要腐敗。這是非常不經濟的一件事。有一種方法可以使鮮菓放置很多的時候不腐，如新鮮的一様。我現在把牠介紹在下面，以供日常之用：</p>
<p>（一）土中保存法</p>
<p>在家中的院子裏，挖一個長方的坑，使剛能容下鮮菓。將土砂塡在四週，最上蓋一層薄土，如果地比較乾燥些，可以加上兩三層鮮菓。這土坑最好安置在通氣的屋篬下，對於人貓狗的尿要特别注意，不能使牠流入，因爲貓，勞動的人，吃肉的人的尿中含有很强的酸性，可以使牠腐爛。</p>
<p>（二）草内保存法</p>
<p>將鮮菓放在雜生的草中，每個鮮菓隔開一點，上蓋以樹葉，下雨時可以使果皮濕潤。這種方法要施行在高斜的地上。在下雨時水不會停留在水菓處。在落雨兩三次後，則立起一棚，高約三尺以遮雨。這兩種方法都可以經好幾個月。</p>
<p>以上兩種方法是日常家中所用得着的，第一法比第二法實用些。鮮菓在一個月要檢查二次，檢查時要小心，輕輕的。如有壞的即拿出。不過挑撰收藏的菓子很不容易，最好要檢新鮮的，無斑痕的。</p>
<p>学　寫笑</p>
<h3>王先生的黨義課</h3>
<p>— 質靑</p>
<p>在渾無秩序的空氣中，敎黨義的王先生夾着講義走進敎室了，</p>
<p>他是一位很和善的先生，從來没有斥責他的學生，臉上常堆着笑容，很懇切地敎着學生，聽他的口音，知道他是崇明人，而且他的衣服穿得很樸素，他的學問很是那般淵博，而且他是永遠地這般謙虚，</p>
<p>然而學生們總是這様的，那些厲害的先生上課時，誰也不敢說一句話或做另外的事，甚至連眼睛也不敢向窗外斜視一下，但當這些和善的先生來時，那就要鬧得個不亦樂乎，於是這和善的王先生和婉地說了，</p>
<p>「黨義實在是一種缺乏興趣的功課，不過，假使你能留心，那也很可使你去研究的價值呢，」</p>
<p>「但是，先生，我們在初中裏不曾研究過黨義呢，」一個綽號小小記者的這様說，</p>
<p>「不見得吧，你從前那兒讀的，怎會没有黨義呢，况且敎育部……」</p>
<p>「不啊，不啊，我並没有說没有黨義，我說，在初中裏的黨義先生，是天天生病或到縣黨部開會的，所以就等于未曾研究了，」</p>
<p>接着全敎室哄然大笑起來，又有幾個學生大呌起來，</p>
<p>「王先生，他搗亂，搗亂……」</p>
<p>王先生仍是很和婉地講着，「這不應當是呌做搗亂，至多，我們只能說是尋開心吧！而且我知道他是不會搗亂的，正好，現在找着一個很好的題目了，我就把這「搗亂」二字來講吧，」</p>
<p>全課堂又哄然地笑了起來，</p>
<p>王先生整頓着全副精神講了，學生們的聲音似乎小了一些，有的是喁談着昨天光陸國泰的影片，有的是談着學校對面和他們相熟悉的另外的密斯們，有的打着紙條兒，滿寫着我敬愛的，有的在咬花生米，有的在看小說，還有的是睡着了，被贊爲書獃子的三四個學生，是在靜靜地聽着，</p>
<p>一點鐘過去了，黨義是連着二課的，王先生精神狠飽滿地在繼續地講着，學生仍是如此上課着，</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>「先生，可以下課了，只有十餘分鐘了，」</p>
<p>「硬板登坐了二點鐘，屁股也坐痛了，」</p>
<p>敎室中又熱鬧起來了，</p>
<p>「某偉人娶了幾個老婆？王先生」，</p>
<p>「他的大老婆吃醋得很厲害呢？」</p>
<p>「但是有人說她又同某戲子有愛情了」，</p>
<p>「聽說×要人在日本士官學校讀書時，遇到考試，是某人替他代筆的，是眞的吧，先生，」</p>
<p>「不要說别様，他的中文都很不通呢，現在居然成爲中國的要人，現在的中國，眞是氣數，」</p>
<p>和善的先生，仍是很和婉地對待學生，他把他所知道的許多理智的答案答知學生，但是，學生們的問題才是無窮呢，</p>

<p>家　問題</p>
<h3>弟弟的一封信</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>哥哥</p>
<p>我知道不兌現的空言是無濟於事的，我們雖是異母的兄弟，但是爸爸還是我們的爸爸，他對於哥哥的飄泊天涯，雖然以威嚴的語氣在報紙上責備你，我每天暗察老人家的行言舉止，何嘗忍心如此呢？</p>
<p>二姊出閣的上夜，她偷偷的問我有大哥的信嗎？這次喜事表面都露着笑臉和來賓寒喧，而不可遏止的隠痛使我痛哭了半夜，尤其是晚餐时，爸爸握着酒杯，眼珠停止在前面的壁上，顫慄着說，「要是進兒娶媳婦呢！……」哥哥，老人家舐犢情深，言詞之間，何嘗不希望你早日歸來，當時五妹還不識趣問爸爸，「大哥爲什麽不回來吃二姊的喜酒呢？」哥哥，老人家竟哭了，哥哥，老境是人生最苦的境遇，爸爸處於兩難的地位，而終於老淚縱横，所以我說爸爸還是我們的爸爸，你體諒老人家的風燭殘年，歸來安慰他空寞的心吧，</p>
<p>二姊帶着没有見大哥的心被花轎抬走了，爸爸大槪也想起了晚境悽凉而不能安睡吧，我大哭了之後，心中反舒暢了，和衣起來，望着澄潔的明月寫這封信，哥哥，弟弟整理好了衣箱等你，十天之内，不見你歸來，也飄泊天涯，與哥哥共甘苦，雪弟於月明之夜，</p>
<p>談天説地</p>
<h3>預言</h3>
<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>一九四○年以後的婚姻，摩登女郎參政運動成功，女權更澎湃，當頒佈新法律，實行一妻多夫制度，爲的是女孩子們靈肉都要滿足。</p>
<p>一九三五年，中國被認爲世界第一等國。取得這地位和信仰的原因，是因爲中國的和平政策驚人；先鎭靜，後長期抵抗，全國歡聲震天，慶祝不抵抗勝利！</p>
<p>同年，世界和議開紀念大會。公推中國内戰專家主席，由老牌軍閥報告，中國歷年爲人類和平友愛前途犧牲自己忍痛搆兵的忠實，衆拍手，代表矜持的引爲不世的光榮。</p>
<p>一九三八年，中國國内建立吹牛學院，并派幹才到各國游說，勸各國政府選英才到我國受新敎育，俾得深造。同時，兼受以精神文明的最高學科和平奮鬥云。</p>
<p>一九三八年德國裸體日光浴丨自然主義，中國的時髦男女也在實行。鄭孝胥輩臭遺老因爲人心不古自殺，</p>
<p>一九三六年，賢明的政治家因爲救濟失業問題，主張人材公開主義，但以爐火純清的中年以上爲合格，能吸食鴉片者，更佳。旣可避免少年人的激烈思想行爲，又可促成鴉片公賣，補救財政困難！</p>
<p>一九四四年，全國游民敎育已普及，博士亦有五十萬人。確實統計，三萬萬人失業。</p>
<p>同年，全國都建設好了公園，以便無家可歸的人流連。國内玲瓏樓閣，佈置華麗，即厠所的建築費，也在千萬金元以上，玫瑰花環住四週。失業的游人齊唱讚美詩，</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Ceremony for the Water Release of the Jinghui Canal - Bin</h3>
<p>The Jinghui Canal in northern Shaanxi's Wei River area, whose construction began in October of the year before last, is now completed. Yesterday, the water release ceremony was formally held. With the completion of this canal, water from the Jing River will be diverted for irrigation. From now on, the five counties of Jingyang, Gaoling, Sanyuan, Lintong, and Liquan in northern Wei will hopefully be spared from drought and famine. Although the project is not particularly large-scale, this type of construction work is rare today and is deeply gratifying.</p>
<p>The Jing River is a tributary of the Wei River. The land through which it flows is fertile, but due to the dry climate, it often suffers from drought. Therefore, this natural water resource is most suitable for irrigation. Historically, diverting the Jing River to irrigate fields dates back to the Qin Dynasty when Zheng Guo opened a canal, starting at the valley mouth, following the northern mountains, cutting through the Ye, Qing, Qi, and Ju rivers, and entering the Luo River. History says it irrigated 45,000 hectares, and Guanzhong was free from famine from then on. During the Han Dynasty, Bai Gong opened a canal that still exists today. In the Song Dynasty, there was the Fengli Canal, and in the Yuan Dynasty, the Wang Imperial Censor's Canal. During the Ming Dynasty, there were the Guanghui and Tongji Canals. In the late Qing Dynasty, a dam was rebuilt to block the Jing River, specifically to divert spring water, and it was renamed the Longdong Canal. Since then, the canal body leaked, and the irrigated land decreased daily, and the water resources could not be utilized. The various districts in northern Wei were then unable to escape drought and famine. Since the Republic of China, politics have been chaotic, and internal wars have occurred frequently. The government had no time to attend to construction, and the people, with the social economy declining daily and livelihoods becoming increasingly difficult, had no ability to rectify water conservancy and improve agriculture. The Longhai campaign in the 19th year plunged Shaanxi and Gansu into an unprecedentedly miserable situation, gradually weakening the people's ability to prevent disasters, and the disasters became increasingly severe. The year before last, there was a major drought in the Northwest, and Shaanxi and Gansu were the most severely affected. Disaster victims exchanged children to eat and sold their wives for food. Fields were filled with starving corpses, and roads were filled with refugees. The desolation was utterly tragic. If the authorities cannot actively construct to preempt and eliminate disasters, they should at least passively avoid creating disasters, and not add to natural disasters with human actions. Then the drought the year before last would certainly not have been so severe. To have water resources and not know how to use them, only looking up to the blue sky and waiting silently for the dictates of fate, is not only lamentable but also shameful. Now that the Jinghui Canal is completed, although its benefits only extend to five counties, we sincerely hope that this is the beginning of construction, and especially hope that this type of construction will establish a national standard.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is something we cannot help but say. Since the development of modern science and the evolution of civilization, the theory of "natural disasters" is fundamentally untenable. European and American countries have taken every possible measure to prevent water, drought, epidemics, and all kinds of natural harms. Even if they occur, they quickly implement relief and urgently seek recovery. Only our country seems to stand outside the circle of this civilized world, with the whole country trembling before nature, suffering its threats and persecution every day. We cannot prevent disasters, nor can we provide relief. When disasters come, we can only wait for death, and then we add to them with human actions, creating man-made disasters. Natural disasters and man-made disasters then follow each other in a cycle. For the past twenty years, there has been disaster every year. In southern and northern China, there are vast areas of red earth. People have no food to eat when alive and no burial ground when dead. The old and weak roll around in ditches, and the young and strong wander in all directions. The country's vitality is utterly exhausted. This is truly something to weep bitterly and lament long and deeply.</p>
<p>Take the mighty Yangtze River, originally a great asset, but due to prolonged neglect, it has become a water of calamity. Last year's flood caused disaster in many provinces. Even now, the disaster area has not recovered, and the disaster victims are still on the road. However, water conservancy construction has not yet been actively undertaken. The continuous rain these days has caused the Yangtze River to rise again, and floods are about to recur. Looking ahead, the worries are endless. We truly cannot help but cry out for the wronged souls of the disaster victims, and even more, cannot help but plead for the remaining survivors.</p>
<p>Now that the Jinghui project is completed, our feelings compel us to use this to appeal to the awakening of the government authorities, and hope that the provinces will take this as a model and quickly catch up.</p>

<h3>Mrs. Gu Holds a Tea Party</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wang, Song, and Luo all attended Mrs. Gu's tea party, but Lytton did not go due to a stomach ailment.

<p>Gu Has Decided Not to Cross to the East</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yoshida met with Luo with a telegram from the Japanese government, stating that the Japanese public is dissatisfied with Gu's post-Northeast remarks, and the Japanese government is not responsible for Gu's safety. After discussions between Wang and Luo, Luo visited Lytton and questioned Gu's safety after going to Japan. Lytton said there was no solution. Wang, Luo, and others decided that Gu would not go. However, the day before the Investigation Team leaves Beiping, the government will formally declare the circumstances of Japan's refusal of Gu. Japan believes that the visit of Wang, Luo, Song, and others to Beiping is a diplomatic counterattack. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Authorities Will Issue a Formal Statement</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side is strongly opposed to Gu's visit to Japan. Yoshida stated to the Investigation Team the day before yesterday that if Gu goes to Japan, the Japanese government will not be responsible for his protection. Yesterday, Yoshida again expressed the same to Luo at Tang Erhe's residence. The Investigation Team seems to lack the courage to uphold justice and has not firmly rejected Japan's unreasonable demands. Gu will not be able to accompany them on the 19th. The Japanese representative was extremely hospitable upon arrival in China, but when Gu went to the Northeast, he instigated the puppet state to obstruct him, and this time he openly refused the visit to Japan. It is reported that our authorities are extremely angry about this. If Gu cannot go with the Investigation Team, they will formally issue a statement declaring the circumstances.

<h3>Luo Says Japan and the Puppet State are Different</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Luo Wengan received reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon. According to reports, the last time Gu went to the Eastern Provinces, it was because of Chinese land, so he went despite Xie Jieshi's refusal. However, Japan is a country, and if Japan does not welcome him, it should be reconsidered. Our side only hopes that the report of the Investigation Team is based on facts and advocates fairness. As long as obstacles can be removed in Sino-Japanese negotiations, the method is still not up for discussion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a declaration regarding the Japanese parliament's recognition of the puppet state. The relationship between China and Russia is good, and the resumption of diplomatic relations can be discussed at any time. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Issues a Statement on the Northeastern Customs Incident</h3>
<p>The Puppet Government is Withdrawing Tax Revenue from Various Ports and Infringing on Dalian</p>
<p>Dalian is a Japanese Leased Territory and is Completely Managed by the Japanese</p>
<p>Interference in Dalian is a Direct Act of Japanese Infringement of the Agreement</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Ziwen issued an English statement opposing the puppet state taking over the Northeast Customs, mainly stating that the puppet state is about to take over the Northeast Customs and the Dalian Customs, destroying the integrity of China's customs. The customs in various parts of the Northeast are related to China's foreign debt. Dalian is a Japanese leased territory, so how can the puppet state forcibly take over the customs in that area? (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Ziwen issued a declaration today regarding the customs matter in the three eastern provinces, stating briefly that in the past, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued declarations, asking the public to pay attention to the Japanese government's attempt, under the guise of the so-called "Manchukuo authorities," to interfere with the administration of the customs in the three eastern provinces. The tax revenues of Harbin, Niuzhuang, and Andong have been suspended from being remitted to the General Taxation Department since March 28th, April 16th, and April 19th, respectively. The recent developments have even made the situation more dangerous. According to reports from the tax officials in various places in the three eastern provinces, the puppet government is now withdrawing and withholding the tax revenues of various ports, and now expanding its infringement to Dalian, demanding the tax revenues of that port and ordering the tax officials and the banks storing the tax funds (Bank of China and Yokohama Specie Bank) to stop remitting the funds to the General Taxation Department. The banks, now under the control of the Japanese authorities, have refused to remit funds since June 7th. The implications of this action are even greater, as the tax collected by the Dalian Customs (which remains intact until now) exceeds half of the total tax collected by all the ports in the three eastern provinces. Furthermore, Dalian is land leased by China to Japan, and the customs there was established in 1907 by an international agreement concluded between China and Japan. When the so-called "Manchukuo authorities" interfered with the customs of Andong, Harbin, and Niuzhuang, Japan claimed that they were acting alone and had nothing to do with the Japanese government, which was ridiculed by those in the know. But today's actions in Dalian leave Japan with no excuse to shirk responsibility, as the port is leased to Japan and completely managed by the Japanese. Therefore, interference with the customs of Dalian is a direct act by Japan in violating a solemn international agreement. The total amount of customs revenue from various ports in the three eastern provinces, based on the amount collected in the past five years, averages 15 percent of the total customs revenue. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the customs revenue of the three eastern provinces totaled 26,078,000 silver taels, equivalent to 39,117,000 yuan in national currency. Japan and its puppets arbitrarily destroy international agreements and guarantees, which is a matter of great concern to the entire world. If not contested, it will set a bad precedent, and the customs, the general lifeline of China's domestic and foreign credit, will disintegrate from now on. Not only are China's major domestic and foreign loans and indemnities secured by customs duties, but there are also many railway loans among the overdue loans, for which the Chinese government has guaranteed to repay with a portion of the surplus customs revenue. Furthermore, the loss of customs revenue from the three eastern provinces will place the burden of various obligations secured by customs duties on other ports in China. In the current economic difficulties, the entire customs revenue of a country averages about 310,000,000 yuan in national currency per year, including the three eastern provinces, of which more than 250,000,000 yuan must be used to pay various items secured by customs duties and customs expenses. Now, with a sudden loss of 39,000,000 yuan in revenue from the total amount, the impact is truly unbearable. The unavoidable result of occupying tax revenue will be that the puppet government will send personnel to manage all the customs in the three eastern provinces, severing its economic ties with China and, for all intents and purposes, making it a part of Japan, like Korea. And China's current trade deficit will increase from this point on, as the three eastern provinces are almost the only important place in China with a surplus of exports. It is reported that the so-called Minister of Finance of Manchukuo notified the Customs Commissioner of Dalian this month, indicating that he would take self-defense plans to ensure that the maintenance of the integrity of the customs administration and the international status quo would not be an issue. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the National Government has made unprecedented sacrifices to live within its means. The entire salt tax revenue of the three eastern provinces (including the allocation for foreign loans) has already been occupied. Now that the customs revenue has been forcibly seized again, the harm is inestimable. If the customs, where the financial lifeline of China is based, is divided, it will inevitably lead to great financial disasters. China's market will be ruined, and the whole world will feel the repercussions. All friendly countries are now concerned about the integrity of the customs, as it is the cornerstone of preventing financial chaos. They are concerned about the customs duties secured by their loans and overdue loans. They have a responsibility to uphold the open-door policy in the three eastern provinces. They have also solemnly guaranteed the integrity of China's land and administration. The world is now plunged into darkness due to economic depression. Friendly countries must not turn a blind eye to this brutal act of destroying the debt repayment ability of four hundred million people. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Reuters reporter today asked a high-ranking official here about the Manchurian customs issue. The official replied that the Japanese government has no authority to interfere with the personnel of the Manchurian customs, so whether Dalian Customs Commissioner Fukumoto obeys the request of the Changchun "Manchukuo" authorities to stop remitting tax revenue to Shanghai, or continues to remit as usual, is up to him to decide himself. However, the Japanese authorities hope that Fukumoto will act in a way that causes as little trouble as possible for the Japanese government, but Japan does not want to interfere with any action he takes. It is reported that the Yokohama Specie Bank is now very uneasy, evidently fearing that after Fukumoto orders its Dalian branch to stop remitting the tax revenue it has stored to the Shanghai General Taxation Department, the Chinese government may order the Yokohama Specie Bank to close its branches in China and seize its stored tax revenue. A spokesperson for the Japanese government said that Japan's concern is that the debts secured by customs taxes continue to be paid as other creditors. However, he believed that the "Manchukuo" authorities, although announcing customs autonomy, will still allocate tax revenues to repay foreign debts secured by this. The intention of certain circles is that if the Dalian customs revenue is not remitted to Shanghai, it will inevitably raise the issue of the current status of the Kwantung Leased Territory, that is, whether Japan should regard the area as leased to it by "Manchukuo" or still regard it as leased by the Chinese government. There has been no commentary on this point in political circles, and the Japanese government has not made a clear statement on the "Manchukuo" customs. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Li Jishen Talks About the Hainan Island Incident</h3>

Jiang and Wang discussed it when they were in Lushan, and they all agreed that internal warfare should not be seen again because foreign troubles are pressing. Although the Hainan Island matter is a local issue, it has a huge impact on international perception. Japan has repeatedly stated in the League of Nations that our country is disorganized and that soldiers are grabbing territory and dividing the country. This kind of insult is deeply painful. Although the League of Nations is not deceived by Japan, it can at least affect international standing. At this time, our country should unite to wash away shame and build friendly countries' confidence in us. Therefore, he has decided to send a telegram to advise both sides to cease the dispute, and will also send private telegrams to the Guangdong side in a private capacity to persuade them to settle the dispute as soon as possible, which is the good fortune of the country.

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Herriot Takes Compromise Plan to Lausanne</h3>
<p>British and French Leaders First Hold Important Consultations</p>
<p>Representatives of the Six Major Powers Continue to Meet Yesterday</p>
<p>National Telegram from Lausanne, 20th: French Prime Minister Herriot and British Prime Minister MacDonald had a lengthy talk this morning. Before their meeting, MacDonald had convened a meeting with French Finance Minister Martin and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain for some time. It is reported that both talks concerned the outline drafted by French Finance Minister Martin with representatives of various countries at the end of the week. Representatives of the six major powers will meet this afternoon to consider the results of the British-French consultations.</p>
<p>Havas Agency Telegram from Lausanne, 20th: Today, Lausanne and Geneva will be extremely busy. Herriot arrived in Lausanne at 7:00 AM this morning and immediately met with the French delegation to provide instructions on the policies France should adopt at this week's Lausanne Conference, as the conference this week will involve political matters. Herriot then visited MacDonald. A major meeting of the six countries of the Lausanne Conference will be convened at 4:00 PM this afternoon to determine the purpose, agenda, and course of action of the Lausanne Conference.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram from London, 20th: Lausanne and Geneva are connected by a car route, so the British and French representatives in Lausanne can drive to Geneva at the end of the week to meet with the American representatives who are participating in the disarmament conference but not in the reparations conference. Although the purpose of their contact is to promote disarmament, the direct contact between British, French, and American politicians is also very beneficial to world issues. Public opinion from all sides praises Britain's promotion of writing off reparations in order to sacrifice finances. Although British critics do not expect Britain's attitude to immediately influence France and make it adopt a complete write-off policy, they believe that this move by British Prime Minister MacDonald will definitely not have no impact on the French cabinet. According to French sources, French Prime Minister Herriot, after discussing with his cabinet members, will return to Lausanne with a compromise plan. It is reported that the compromise will take the form of France being willing to receive a small, final installment, but with conditions restricting Germany from excessive profits after it restores its former prosperity. It is said that France wants a kind of collateral, that is, Germany issuing railway bonds to be stored in creditor countries. France's method is similar to that recently advocated by British economist Keynes, who argued that Germany should make a formal payment in order to acknowledge its obligations, but this payment should not impose a heavier burden on modern Germans than they can shoulder.</p>
<p>Havas Agency Telegram from Paris, 19th: An editorial in the Paris Times, entitled "Lausanne and International Public Opinion," stated: "The French Prime Minister will depart again for Lausanne tonight, intending to discuss the organization of various research committees from next Tuesday to draft a major plan to solve European problems. This plan will be the basis for solving world problems in the future. However, world problems cannot be solved without American cooperation. MacDonald, Grandi, and Poncet will hold private talks with the American representatives in Geneva, Gibson, Norman, and Davis, on disarmament issues today. These talks are valued by the general public from now on. After these talks, to what extent Lausanne and Geneva will be related to each other will be known tomorrow. For the time being, what we want to discuss is only what kind of impression the decision of the Lausanne Conference will make on the world. On the whole, the impression is very good, because the decision-making method is clear and frank, without any ambiguity. The purpose of Lausanne's decision is nothing more than to reserve the necessary time to discuss a complete solution plan. This method can greatly transform the atmosphere and is conducive to the development of negotiations. The feeling about this conference is the same everywhere, except for the German nationalist newspapers, who are deeply afraid that the past affairs 'cannot be written off.' However, after the Lausanne conference, the true facts have been fully revealed, and the Germans' good dreams seem to be shattered. In short, today's events, if countries cooperate, Europe can recover, and the Germans will benefit the most. Otherwise, the chaos will become more and more serious, and world civilization will sink from this. Will Germany be willing to sincerely cooperate with various countries, or will it stubbornly adhere to its unacceptable demands and destroy international cooperation? This is the question we want to understand today."</p>
<h3>England, America and France Exchange Disarmament Opinions</h3>
<p>Havas Agency Telegram, Geneva, 19th: That England, France and America are in conference here to discuss disarmament matters proves that the three countries earnestly desire that the disarmament conference shall conclude at an early date and achieve concrete results. Herriot's and MacDonald's idea is that the best means to accomplish this is to first arrive at preliminary mutual agreement between the three countries. Once the three countries have reached agreement, even though the disarmament conference cannot immediately enter upon a definite course, its complexion will certainly be new. For if the three countries can, within a short period, come up with a joint proposal regarding several key points, then the other countries will inevitably follow suit. The representatives of the three countries attending the negotiations appear to be particularly focused on rapidly searching for a solution in principle. This solution should be no more than a few items, with emphasis on practicality, so that the people of all countries can obtain substantial satisfaction in the first step.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, Geneva, 20th: British Foreign Secretary Simon rushed here from Lausanne this morning, in order to participate in the conference of British, French and American representatives which began yesterday. The head of the American delegation, Gibson, did not attend the meeting, and has not stated the reason, which has aroused commentary from the general public. Participating in this discussion are British Foreign Secretary Simon, British Secretary of State for Air Londonderry, French Minister of War Poncet, and American representative Hugh Wilson, etc.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, Geneva, 20th: The meeting of the British, American and French representatives for the Disarmament Conference lasted an hour and a half, and continued to meet at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It is now known that Gibson's absence is not of great importance.</p>
<h3>Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg Form Customs Union</h3>
<p>Reuters Telegram, Lausanne, 20th: Belgium and Holland have today signed a customs accord, which contains extremely important tax reduction provisions, and will be announced within days. Luxembourg will also join. One of its features is that any countries can join on a reciprocal basis.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, Geneva, 19th: Diplomatic authorities from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg are meeting here, strenuously advocating uniform tax reductions as quickly as possible, in order to alleviate economic distress. According to sources in Brussels, the King of Belgium has sent a letter to the Belgian Prime Minister, Renkin, who is currently in Lausanne, instructing him to promote international cooperation to eliminate the economic crisis, stating that experts generally believe that the restoration of prosperity depends on the free flow of goods, capital, and labor. Now, tax restrictions are rising higher and higher everywhere, leading to a sharp decrease in exports. International trade is only half of what it was three years ago, and the number of unemployed has doubled. The only effective solution is concerted action.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, Geneva, 19th: The meeting of the diplomatic authorities from the six countries, Sweden, etc., to oppose tax increases has aroused surprise. The public believes that this is the intention of the countries involved to force the Lausanne Conference to accelerate its pace, and to raise events that some people consider should be left to a world congress in the future. According to as yet unconfirmed reports, the six countries, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg, will act alone if their proposals are not adopted. It is also heard that Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg will soon announce the formation of a customs union, and Sweden, Norway, and Denmark will follow suit with similar commercial combinations.</p>
<h3>American Circles Begin Tax Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>Reuters Telegram, London, 20th: Following yesterday's anti-tax conference in Geneva, two related actions have occurred today. According to a Reuters telegram from New York, American bankers, businessmen, and educators have begun a national movement to arouse public opinion and force Congress to act in accordance with the needs of international cooperation. They informed Dr. Butler, the renowned President of Columbia University, that they have been studying the issues related to debts, reparations, taxes, and other obstacles to commerce on behalf of the League of Nations Association. They now believe that in order for the World Economic Conference to be effective, it is necessary to arouse American public opinion and force Congress to act in accordance with the general trend. According to a Reuters telegram from Paris, the Federation of Overseas French Chambers of Commerce unanimously adopted the Secretary-General's report, declaring that excessive protection taxes are sufficient to paralyze international commerce. The report also criticized France's quota system.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, Washington, 20th: Official circles here do not formally criticize the progress of the Lausanne Reparations Conference, but express that American officials are paying attention to the constructive progress Europe is currently making in order to solve the reparations problem.</p>
<h3>German Brown Shirts Demonstrate</h3>
<p>Protesting Ban on Uniforms</p>
<p>Serious Situation in Munich</p>
<p>Hesse State Parliament Elections</p>
<p>National Socialist Party Makes Slight Progress</p>
<p>National Telegram from Munich, 19th: Today, six hundred National Socialists were arrested for resisting the Bavarian government's ban and wearing the brown uniforms of the Sturmabteilung (SA). The group's demonstration was well-planned. Within a short time, people wearing brown uniforms appeared throughout the city, detouring to a predetermined meeting place. Some were arrested along the way, but most were able to reach their destination, where they quickly gathered thousands of people to stage a major demonstration protesting the ban on uniforms. At the same time, the authorities dispatched a large cavalry patrol to the area and used batons to disperse the crowd from all sides. Those who resisted were arrested. In addition, thousands of people wearing uniforms came to the city from the countryside to gather. They were ordered by cavalry patrols at key intersections to return home and change into civilian clothes. Those who resisted were dispersed, and their leaders were arrested.</p>
<p>National Telegram from Berlin, 20th: Following the repeated appearance of the brown Sturmabteilung (SA) uniforms in the streets of German cities, there were many conflicts at the end of the week. More than two hundred people were injured, and many were seriously injured and may not recover. The most conflicts occurred in the Ruhr area, where National Socialists and Communists engaged in several fierce battles, even taking out pistols and firing freely. In addition, almost all industrial centers in the Rhineland were disturbed. Sometimes, before a conflict could be stopped in one place, another emergency was reported elsewhere, and the police were overwhelmed. According to official reports, most of the incidents were initiated by the Communists.</p>
<p>National Telegram from Berlin, 20th: The final report of yesterday's Hesse State Parliament elections has disappointed the National Socialists. The party originally expected to win an absolute majority, but although it made slight progress compared to before, it only won thirty-two seats out of seventy, which is still far from its goal of controlling the parliament. Even with the support of other small parties, it cannot form a stable government without cooperating with the Catholic Center Party, which won ten seats.</p>
<h3>New Chilean Government Denies Air Force Revolt</h3>
<p>Counter-Revolutionary Movement Gains Momentum</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram from the Chilean Capital, 19th: The new Chilean government has formally denied the rumors that the Chilean Air Force has revolted again to prevent the exile of Colonel Grove. The Air Force previously assisted Grove in overthrowing the former government. Now that Grove has failed, there are rumors that the Air Force has risen again to oppose the current government because Grove once served as the commander of the Air Force. The British cruiser HMS Durban has now arrived at Callao.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram from the Chilean Capital, 20th: Martial law has been declared throughout Chile due to the growing momentum of the counter-revolutionary movement, in which the Air Force is also participating. The government has now gathered 6,000 troops in the capital to prevent a communist uprising. Due to the strike by railway workers on the railway from the capital to Valparaíso, the line is now being operated by the military. All railway work throughout the country is also being supervised by the military authorities.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Kobe's Downtown Area</h3>
<p>Electric News Agency Telegram from Kobe, 20th: At 4:20 AM this morning, a fire broke out in the Sannomiya Merchandise Exhibition Hall in Kobe City, which quickly spread in all directions. Sannomiya Street, lined with coffee shops and cinemas, was burned to the ground in an instant. Seventy houses were completely burned, and ten houses were partially burned. The fire was extinguished at 7:00 AM. The damage is estimated at over 1.2 million yuan. The cause of the fire is unknown. There is speculation about arson, which is still under investigation. Due to the early morning hour and the downtown location, there was great confusion. The chief of the Sannomiya Police Station directed the police to fight the fire and was burned. Many others were injured.</p>
<h3>Greek Farmers Riot</h3>
<p>National News Agency, 19th, Athens Telegraph - Today, the Greek authorities dispatched soldiers in automobiles to the town of Mernate Sui Lei in the Lapou Movement Center to suppress a new farmer rebellion.  Local police were unable to quell the unrest, so military assistance was requested.  It is reported that the army has surrounded the entire town and is conducting door-to-door searches for rebel leaders, including Xue Luolai Ning, who is commanding this new rebellion.  This morning, rumors circulated in Athens that Lapou farmers were again gathering to march on the capital, causing great panic among the residents.  However, government officials stated that the new rebellion was only of a local nature and that adequate measures were being taken to prevent it from spreading, which somewhat calmed the public.  Nevertheless, many people still fear that the Lapou Movement will not be easily pacified.</p>
<h3>Will China Become Red?</h3>
<p>An Article by Englishman Harris</p>
<p>Reuters, 20th, London Telegraph - The Chronicle News today published an article by Harris entitled, "Will China Become Red?" It states that China is constantly in danger of becoming red, and that this danger has not disappeared today. It also states that this is not a natural development at all, as communism has nothing special to attract Chinese farmers. However, since the primary objective of the Red Party has already been shattered, any unrest is sufficient to grant them an opportunity. What China fears is this kind of communism. Resuming diplomatic relations with Russia would be the best thing that China and Japan could do. If China can unite and establish a stable government, then China will surely one day become the world's largest market for the sale of goods from other countries. Harris also advocates adopting the recommendations in Curtis's recent book on China, namely that Britain should send its most capable person to China as ambassador. If this person can gain the trust of Chinese cabinet members, the opportunities to cooperate with them for the public good would be limitless.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Railway President Uchida Returns to Assume Foreign Minister Post Around July 6th</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, 20th, Tokyo Telegraph - Manchurian Railway President Uchida will return to Manchuria from Tokyo at 9:00 PM tomorrow, going directly to Shenyang. After meeting with Commander Honjo of the Kwantung Army, he will meet with key figures in the puppet government in Changchun and then return to Dalian. He will arrive in Tokyo on July 5th, so he is expected to assume the post of Foreign Minister around July 6th. After President Uchida's resignation, the Japanese government will not appoint a new president for the Manchurian Railway, but has decided to have Vice President Hatta act as president.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, 20th, Tokyo Telegraph - Manchurian Railway President Uchida, who visited Prince Saionji, arrived at Shinbashi Station in Tokyo last night at 8:00 PM. Uchida answered the following questions from reporters in the car:</p>
<p>Reporter asked: The government has decided to establish a new agency to unify the so-called four-headed administration of Manchuria. What is your opinion on this?</p>
<p>Answer:  I only know what the government has decided. I am not aware of it in my capacity as President of the Manchurian Railway. Please ask the government.</p>
<p>Asked: The League of Nations General Assembly will review the Manchurian Incident in November under Article 15 of the Covenant. Is this illegal?</p>
<p>Answer:  Regardless of the attitude the League takes, Japan should bravely move forward according to its established policy from its own standpoint. There is no need to look left and right at the attitude of the League. It is absolutely unacceptable to change Japan's position based on the arguments of people who do not know the actual situation in Manchuria. My greatest hope is for the League's proper understanding.</p>
<p>Asked: The world is watching your trip to Manchuria with great interest. Do you still have such important tasks in Manchuria?</p>
<p>Answer: The mission to Manchuria is naturally related to the internal affairs of the Manchurian Railway, but I am sorry that I cannot say what it is specifically. I will go to Tokyo as soon as the Manchurian affairs are completed.</p>
<h3>Changes in Japanese Diplomatic Personnel</h3>

<h3>Where Did the Bomb Under the Podium Come From?</h3>
<p>Fuse Interrupted, Did Not Explode</p>
<p>Lord Lloyd Escapes Disaster</p>
<p>Reuters, 19th, London Telegraph - Former High Commissioner to Egypt, Lord Lloyd, and the Bishop of Carlisle were standing on a podium delivering a speech to students at St. Bees School in Cumberland when a faint noise suddenly came from under the podium. Upon inspection, a bomb was found. The fuse had been interrupted, so although there was a faint noise, it did not explode. This object was clearly a time bomb intended to explode during the speech. Fortunately, the fuse malfunctioned, so it did not detonate. After the object was discovered, the entire scene was horrified. The Cumberland police chief has telephoned the London police station to request that a bomb expert be sent to investigate, as the bomb was well-made and did not seem to be the work of pranksters.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Puppet State Borrows 300 Million Francs from France</h3>
<p>Collateral is a Certain Large Mine</p>
<p>Dalian News - The puppet state of Manchuria recently contacted the French government to borrow 300 million francs (equivalent to 25 million Japanese yen) and entrusted Japan to negotiate with France on its behalf. It is reported that France has accepted this proposal. The loan is nominally for "assisting the economic construction of the new state of Manchuria." The loan agreement is currently in progress and has been concretized. It will be signed soon. The loan contract is secured by a certain large mine in the Northeast, and there is also talk of Japan providing credit guarantees for the puppet state. The puppet state also declared that it will absolutely adopt an open-door policy in the future and welcome investment from any country. (June 17th)</p>

<p>Manchurian People Aware of Manchurian Danger</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that according to the announcement of the Ministry of the Army, the ignorant Manchurian natives have recently been influenced by environmental propaganda and are harboring fears. They deeply believe that (1) Japan and the United States will go to war in the future, and as a result, the important places along the Pacific coast will inevitably be occupied by the US military, and Japan will be unable to assist Manchuria; (2) the relations between Japan and Russia are deteriorating, and as a result, Japan will have to abandon Manchuria; (3) the League of Nations is doing its utmost to assist China, and Zhang Xueliang will inevitably return to Manchuria in the future. These natives are so confused by these kinds of propaganda that they have caused disputes in the eastern part of Fengtian Province.</p>
<h3>Japanese Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Fall into Extreme Poverty</h3>
<p>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that recently, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government investigated the state of commerce. It roughly found that small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises are mostly on the verge of collapse due to financial pressure. Since the authorities severely cracked down on small banks in the city, most have merged or gone bankrupt, and the remaining large banks have no ability to accommodate small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises. In addition, all the large banks that previously had dealings with small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises are unwilling to lend again because they have lost their credit. Even households with good credit have difficulty obtaining permission from the bank. As for personal loans, they are even more difficult. Even if there are one or two willing to provide emergency assistance, they all raise interest rates excessively. As a result, borrowers have no choice but to fall into a miserable state of poverty. Furthermore, the trade houses that previously relied solely on commodities as collateral for short-term financing are now unable to clear their accounts on schedule due to the decline in purchasing power and the decline in sales. The trade houses are also unable to maintain their original position because it is difficult to recover the loans. General well-established households all regard lending and financing as a dangerous path. Small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises have lost this avenue of support, and as a result, cases of unemployment and bankruptcy are heard every day. Even pawnshops, due to the rebound in prices after the ban on gold, are mostly unable to redeem short-term financing for small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises on schedule, and they also feel great difficulties in their operations.</p>
<h3>Secret Societies Discovered in Japanese Police Circles</h3>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that every time there is a coup, the government will inevitably make a large number of changes in the police circles, and most of those who are appointed as police chiefs are drifters. Recently, influenced by the changes in the coup, the righteous factions among the police officers in Osaka Prefecture secretly organized the "San-ichi-kai" (March 1st Society). Powerful people are manipulating the society from within. The police authorities have learned of this news and consider it to be a major issue. They believe that it is extremely dangerous for the police circles to become politicized.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Security Forces Organized into Four Brigades</h3>
<p>The Navy Also Decides to Add One Brigade</p>
<p>A Situation Separate from the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>Fuzhou News - The armies of Fujian Province are now being reorganized into provincial defense forces due to the entry of the 19th Route Army into Fujian. On the 14th, the provincial government meeting has already passed a resolution to reorganize all the directly affiliated troops of the Security Office into four Class A brigades. Chen Guohui is the brigade commander of the First Brigade, with Chen Peiyu as his deputy, stationed in the four counties of Yongchun, Dehua, Nan'an, and Hui'an. Xiao Shuxuan is the brigade commander of the Second Brigade, with Zhou Xiaopei as his deputy, stationed in the two counties of Fuqing and Gutian, and the western district of Minhou County. Chen Weiyuan is the brigade commander of the Third Brigade, with He Xianzhu as his deputy, stationed in the two counties of Putian and Xianyou. Huang Bingwu is the brigade commander of the Fourth Brigade, with Qian Yuguang as his deputy, stationed in the four counties of Minqing, Yongtai, Zhenghe, and Songxi. In addition to the original two brigades of the Marines, Yang Tingying stationed in the coastal counties of Fuzhou Prefecture and Lin Bingzhao stationed in the coastal counties of Funing Prefecture, it is now heard that the Naval Department will also add one brigade, stationed in the coastal counties of Xiamen Prefecture, with Lin Shouguo as the brigade commander. The troops will be composed of the three units of Li Mugong, a local bandit from Funing, and Lin Jizeng and Dai Qixiong, local Xianyou military forces, who are currently being recruited by Lin. In all cases, a situation separate from the 19th Route Army is being created. After the 19th Route Army arrived in Fujian, the Mao Weishou Division was stationed in Quanzhou. The Chen Guohui Brigade, which was originally stationed there, has now moved to Yongchun. The Qu Shounian Division was stationed in Zhangzhou. The Zhang Zhen Department of the 49th Division, which was originally stationed there, has moved to the counties of Zhao'an, Yunxiao, Pinghe, and Zhangpu. The Shen Guanghan Division was stationed in Fuzhou. The Liu Heding Department of the 56th Division, which was originally stationed there, has moved to the two prefectures of Yanping and Jian'ou. Liu led the troops remaining in the province to Yanping on the evening of the 15th. However, the people of Fujian believe that the province cannot accommodate such a huge army, and they are now preparing for a large-scale movement. After Jiang Guangnai enters Fujian to take office as the Pacification Director, they will demand that reorganization and disbandment be implemented in order to reduce the burden. (June 16th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Decides to Implement Special Business Tax</h3>
<p>Provincial Business Federation Firmly Opposes</p>
<p>The Finance Department is Determined to Implement It</p>
<p>Shu Shifu, Director of the Finance Department of Jiangsu Province, discussed the financial problems of the province with the members of the Provincial Business Federation on the 13th. As a result, the Business Federation firmly opposed the special business tax. They could accept the improvement of the business tax collection and business license tax. However, the tax rate should be divided into two types: capital and business, and collected quarterly. A tax rate table was drafted and submitted in writing to Director Shu. The general idea was that they were grateful for his instructions to improve the business tax and for his consideration of the difficulties of businesses and his comprehensive planning. However, the special business tax has already been explicitly abolished by the Executive Yuan. Although he has indicated that he will shorten the trial period, since card checkpoints must be set up for collection, it will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the Likin tax. The people's feelings are mostly unfavorable, and it is feared that it will harm his prestige. Whether it can be promoted to the fullest extent is doubtful, and it will cause many obstacles to the improvement of the business tax. This Association's knowledge is more accurate, and it dares not fail to submit this. Therefore, it is especially requested that you quickly follow the central government's order to withdraw the preparatory personnel in order to maintain commerce and stabilize the people's hearts. Director Shu immediately replied that he was still determined that he could not overcome the difficulties without implementing the special tax. Otherwise, he would request a loan of 2 million yuan. The letter roughly stated that the province's change to the special business tax was originally a last resort. He had already explained the details in person the other day, and he hoped that he would be able to see through it. This is a transitional measure before the tax revenue is reorganized. There is no other way. If your Association can arrange to borrow 2 million yuan before the 22nd of this month, as a result of the face-to-face talks the other day, to overcome this difficulty, then all the problems can be solved. This Department will also never insist on the original proposal. Otherwise, due to the pressure of the environment, there is no rice to cook. In order to maintain the local area and to cope with military pay, the only thing to do is to implement the establishment of offices for collection from July 1st to provide relief. If this is delayed for a long time, one thing will be delayed and hundreds of government policies will be delayed. This Department can hardly bear the responsibility. He was quick to speak and hoped for understanding. After receiving the letter, the Provincial Business Federation believed that the Finance Department was determined to implement the special tax and business tax, and it had telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to request that it be stopped again.

<p>Swearing Not to Import Privately in the Future</p>

They have now been circulated to all counties for implementation. The measures are as follows: (1) In order to deal with the sealing up of Japanese goods and the re-entry of resisting enemy goods, these measures are specially formulated for the purpose of thoroughly eliminating enemy goods. (2) Each county should conduct a general clearing of the sealed enemy goods by the National Salvation Association in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce, and conduct a thorough clearing in accordance with the registered number of each business.

(3) The opened enemy goods should be sold by each business in a separate public sales department for enemy goods to show the difference, and the sales numbers should be reported to the National Salvation Association and the Chamber of Commerce on a weekly basis for inspection at any time. (4) Before the opening of the sealed enemy goods, the National Salvation Association and the Chamber of Commerce should convene a joint oath meeting of the persons in charge of each business, swearing that they will never import enemy goods again. The oath is to be formulated separately. (5) The deadline for selling the original sealed enemy goods shall not exceed six months from the date of opening the seal. The enemy goods that have not been sold after the deadline shall be confiscated and disposed of by other methods. (6) After the opening of the original sealed enemy goods, they shall only be sold in this county and shall not be circulated to other counties. (7) When the sealed enemy goods are sold, the National Salvation Association and the Chamber of Commerce should extract 5% of the value of the goods to be used as national defense funds, stored in a bank for safekeeping, and not be used. The number of extractions should be listed and reported to the local Party Department and the government for record, and forwarded to the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government for record. (8) All stores shall never be allowed to import enemy goods privately again. If any fraudulent acts are discovered or similar, in addition to confiscating all of the enemy goods, a fine of more than ten times the value of the goods shall be imposed, and those with serious circumstances shall be subject to the most severe punishment. (9) The National Salvation Association and the Chamber of Commerce in each county should send personnel at any time to conduct strict inspections to prevent the entry of enemy goods, and investigate the situation of the enemy transporting goods on their own, so as to expose it to the society. (10) The National Salvation Association and the Chamber of Commerce in each county should send personnel at any time to investigate whether the sales number and inventory quantity of each business are consistent, and whether there are enemy goods in the newly imported goods to prevent abuses. (11) If the National Salvation Association and the Chamber of Commerce in each county encounter a situation where the identification of goods cannot be decided, they should temporarily seal up a copy of each sample, and the shipper should submit a request for appraisal, and seek a guarantor to guarantee that the meeting will be entrusted for appraisal. If the appraisal result confirms that it is an enemy good, it should be dealt with more severely in accordance with Article 8, and the form of the request for appraisal shall be formulated separately. (12) If the National Salvation Association and the Chamber of Commerce in each county find any malfeasance in handling the suppression of enemy goods, they shall be subject to the most severe punishment. Attached oath: "I solemnly swear that I will never buy Japanese goods again in the future. If I violate the oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment." (20th)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Bandit Suppression in Northern Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Renhua and Chengkou Have Been Recovered</p>
<p>Lechang and Jianghua Warn Again</p>
<p>Guangzhou News - Recently, there have been reports from the border police in northern Guangdong Province that when the Yu Hanmou Department of the First Army was stationed in southern Jiangxi, the Communist bandit Li Mingrui's group fled from eastern Jiangxi to southern Hunan, invading Renhua County in northern Guangdong Province. The county's Changjiangwei, Dongtangwei, Tangcun, Houkeng, Sichun, and Chengkou were all captured and ravaged, and refugees were displaced and displaced. At that time, the Xiang Army Zhao Zixin and Chen Tiejian Departments in Pingshi, Lechang, also reported mutiny. The authorities urgently sent the Chen Hanguang Department of the Guard Brigade to Pingshi to block them. Therefore, the bandits in Renhua were able to grow stronger and even invaded the county seat. Before long, the Pingshi incident was settled. The Chen Brigade returned to Renhua to suppress them. The Luo Cequn Regiment of the Teaching Division drove from Shao to intercept them. At the same time, the Chen Zhang Department of the Independent Second Brigade drove back from Nanxiong to flank them. The Fan Dexing Brigade of the First Independent Brigade, which had penetrated into southern Jiangxi, also returned to encircle the eastern part of Hunan. Although Li's bandits had two or three thousand people, they could not support themselves after being jointly suppressed by the three brigades. First, after the Fan Dexing Brigade moved south, it captured Niedu on the 2nd of this month. The left wing of Li's bandits was greatly oppressed, and the remaining troops fled to Wenyin Shipyard and other places. The Fan Brigade pursued them to the shipyard. The troops of Li who had penetrated into Renhua were worried that their retreat would be cut off, and the Chen Zhang Brigade stationed in Nanxiong attacked and advanced from Xiong, fighting fiercely with the bandits. Then, on the 4th, Fuxi was captured. The remnant bandits then retreated to the north. The Chen Brigade captured Changjiangwei on the 5th. Changjiangwei was occupied by the bandits for more than ten days, and the people fled completely. The local area suffered heavy damage. Although Li's bandits withdrew from Changjiang, one group in Chengkou still occupied it. Chengkou leads to Rucheng. The bandits relied on the fact that the rear road could be connected, so they still resisted stubbornly. The Chen Hanguang Brigade then entered Renhua from Lechang to suppress them, and Dongtang, Sichun, Tangcun, Houkeng, and other places were recovered in succession. The Chen Zhang Brigade then went out of Dongkeng Pingshashui from Changjiang to join the attack on Chengkou. The Chen Hanguang Brigade and the Luo Cequn Regiment were the main force in the attack, and they fought fiercely with the bandits for half a day. Until the morning of the 6th, they captured Chengkouwei. The Chen Hanguang Brigade entered Chengkou to appease the exiles, and the Liang Regiment of the Chen Zhang Brigade was stationed in Changjiang, and the Du Regiment was stationed in Fuxi waiting for orders. The remaining bandits of Li Mingrui's Department have now fled back to Rucheng, Xiangdong, and other places. However, the bandits are good at using the method of avoiding the real and attacking the empty. Although they withdrew from Chengkou on the morning of the 6th, another group harassed Pingshi and Lechang. The bandit suppression army in Renhua was unable to move. The province again transferred the three battalions of the Zhuang Menxiong Department of the Teaching Regiment directly under the headquarters, and they took a car to Shao on the 7th to provide assistance to Lechang. At the same time, the third battalion of the Peng Zhifang Department of the third regiment of the guard brigade stationed in Lian County in Xiaobeijiang was transferred from Lian to Pingshi for deployment, and the situation became tense again. According to another message, recently, more than 2,000 bandits were found in Jianghuawei in southern Hunan. Jianghua is located in the north of Xiaobeijiang. One road leads to Xiaobeijiang, and the other road leads to Hexian in Guangxi. The bandits' whereabouts are erratic and uncertain. It is not yet known whether this group of bandits is a communist bandit or the Chen and Zhao departments of the Xiang Army that were defeated the other day. However, the bandit forces in northern Guangdong are spreading like this, and it is expected that they will not be cleared in a short time. (June 12th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Executive and Supervisory Committee Members Designated by the Provincial Department - The county's Executive and Supervisory Committee was previously instructed by the Provincial Party Department to hold a re-election. Personnel were sent to Songjiang last month to guide the election. The number of executive and supervisory committee members was doubled and reported to the provincial department for selection. It is now known that the province has designated five members: Zhang Baozhi, Ye Dingchu, Zhang Bingyuan, and Tan Baoren as executive committee members; Wu Jiaju, Shen Yuxuan, and Lu Shusheng as alternate executive committee members; Li Chang, Shen Fuyun, and Cai Dingyu as supervisory committee members; and Chen Qizhang as an alternate supervisory committee member. After the County Party Department received the order, it immediately ordered the department to rush to prepare for the handover.</p>
<p>Security Corps Training Officer Comes to Songjiang - The county's Security Corps is now being actively organized by the county government, and the list of candidates for the district corps leaders in each district has been reported to the general corps headquarters for verification and appointment. The date of appointment is on record. Jiang Shizai, a native of the county, previously studied at the Provincial Security Corps Instructor Training Institute and has already graduated. He was instructed to be sent back to Songjiang to take charge of the county's training matters. Mr. Jiang has now been appointed and returned to Songjiang to take office. The establishment of the Security Corps is imminent, and there is an urgent need for clothing and equipment, but there are no funds available. It was resolved at the fifth administrative meeting to collect household registration donations in accordance with the method used by former County Magistrate Jin when he established the Public Security Team. It will be implemented as soon as it is reported to the province for approval.</p>
<p>Alleyway Lawsuit - In the middle section of Zhuganhuilai outside Ximen in Songjiang, when the Xu family bought the Wang family's house site in the past, considering that the river was a place for ships to dock and for neighbors to wash rice and fetch water, or to fetch water in case of unexpected events, they split a small alleyway for the convenience of sailors to enter and exit. When Mr. Gu Yingfu bought it, it remained as it was. Unexpectedly, Yao Runmin, a newly relocated local tyrant from Fengjing, who lived nearby, was across from the alleyway. At first, he planned to build a circle on the ground and a drain underground, infringing on the sovereignty of the Gu family and harming the public interest. Because of the lawsuit with the Yao family, Yao had great powers and clever means, and he won the lawsuit. Now Yao is firmly requesting the official authorities to execute it, but the official authorities do not know the truth, and there is a saying that they will send the police to enforce it forcibly. Now Gu Yingfu has informed the town mayor Zhang Qingquan of the matter, and Mayor Zhang has sent a letter to the First District Office, stating that Mr. Gu lives in Zhuganhuilai, and the alleyway site is indeed the sovereignty of Mr. Gu, and the alleyway is convenient for nearby residents and sailors to enter and exit, which is praised by everyone. Now Yao Runmin has won the lawsuit, so public opinion is in an uproar. For the sake of public convenience and sovereignty in the local area, he should be informed to check. It is said that the people in the area believe that Yao is disregarding public morality and using money and power to forcibly take the Gu family's property as his own. Such bullying and possession is dark and without daylight, so property owners will be in danger. Therefore, they are all moved to public anger and will appeal to all agencies.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>

The letters roughly stated that the Association had repeatedly submitted petitions to the senior administrative organs in the capital to request relief. According to the current laws and regulations, administrative organs shall not enforce it before the appeal is resolved. Unexpectedly, the County Finance Bureau still insisted on its own way, disregarding it. It had no choice but to telegraph and petition again. Colleagues are all people of a rule-of-law country, and there should be considerable protection in law. No matter how difficult and dangerous, they swear to be the backing. They swear not to recognize illegal oppression. It is hoped that each tenant will postpone payment as much as possible in order to maintain livelihood and comply with laws and regulations.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Silk Prices Plunge, Silkworm Farmers Lament: This year's spring silkworm crop suffered a disastrous failure. Cocoon prices were shockingly low, leaving silkworm farmers in a state of despair and frustration. Many farmers, lacking the capital to dry and bake the cocoons due to the low fresh cocoon prices, opted to reel the fresh cocoons into raw silk for sale, hoping for a better price. However, this too resulted in great disappointment. Initially, each hundred taels of silk could be sold for more than thirty yuan, but it soon fell to more than twenty yuan, and now it has plummeted to around twenty yuan, with even stricter quality requirements.</p>
<p>Proposed Measures to Investigate Enemy Goods: The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Union has repeatedly received proposals from the Zhenjiang, Huai'an, and other county chambers of commerce. After the Shen Incident, merchants in various places voluntarily sealed up enemy goods. Later, in March of this year, the province issued an order stating that local finances were not circulating smoothly, and the social economy was in a state of panic. A decision was made at a Party and government discussion meeting regarding the disposal of sealed enemy goods in various counties, instructing each county to consider the local situation and handle it separately to provide relief. However, at that time, the situation in Shanghai was tense, and the situation with Japan changed abruptly. Merchants in various places felt deeply resentful and unanimously postponed the implementation of this measure. Now that the Shanghai Agreement has been signed, the counties have not yet recovered from the ravages of war, and the financial situation is stagnant, making it impossible to turn around. Regarding these sealed enemy goods, a request has been made to the Party and government to change the method, approve their clearance, and strictly prevent the import of goods. The conference then discussed the matter and decided to handle it in accordance with the provincial order, considering the local situation, and in reference to the measures decided by the Party and government discussion meeting, to determine the closure of sealed goods and to strictly prevent the import of goods as the principle. The main points of the decided measures for the counties to investigate and seal enemy goods are recorded as follows: (1) The county chambers of commerce shall, together with the industry associations, under the supervision and guidance of the local Party and government organs, organize a committee for investigating and sealing enemy goods. (2) The industry associations shall convene the responsible persons of each business firm, solemnly swear that they will no longer import enemy goods, sign and seal the oath, and submit it to the committee for filing. (3) The sealed enemy goods shall be checked by the committee. After confirming that the numbers match the registered numbers, they may be unsealed, and a separate section shall be set up in the store for selling them separately. The sales figures shall be reported to the association on a ten-day basis. (4) If the enemy goods of each business firm are transferred to other areas, they shall report to the committee and issue one, two, or three copies of the freight permit. One copy shall be kept for filing, one shall be given to the business firm to be transported with the goods, and one shall be given by the association to the destination committee for inspection. (5) The sales period for enemy goods shall be temporarily limited to eight months. (6) If any business firm is found to have privately imported enemy goods, once verified, in addition to burning the goods, a fine of ten times the value of the goods shall be imposed. (7) The committee may send inspectors to strictly check at water and land transportation locations to prevent smuggling. The above measures have been submitted by the Chamber of Commerce Union to the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government Industry Department, urging them to issue orders for compliance as soon as possible to maintain financial stability and save the market. They have also been submitted to the Provincial Government for approval by the Party and government discussion meeting, and once the measures are revised, they will be ordered to be implemented by the counties.</p>
<p>Sale of Military Rice, Offender Sent to Department for Interrogation: When the 19th Route Army was fighting against Japan in Shanghai, it set up a general supply station in Nanxiang, purchasing and accumulating a large amount of grain and various military supplies. When the strategy was changed and they retreated to the second line of defense, all the remaining military rice, more than five hundred stones, and automobiles and clothing were not taken away. Later, after the Japanese army occupied the area, some traitors organized a local maintenance association, which sold all the military rice and divided the profits. Later, the 78th Division was stationed in Wuxi and ordered to leave for Fujian soon. The military rice previously stored in Nanxiang should be thoroughly investigated. Division Commander Qu specially sent Li Zhongfu, section chief of the military supply department, and Adjutant He Bin to Nanxiang to work with the security corps to arrest Fang Sentai, chairman of the maintenance association and owner of Yanghuo Store, Fang Songtai, Ba Yu Da, staff member of the association and owner of Yanghuo Store, Ba Runzhi, and Ba Lingyun, father and son, Gu Xunbo, former staff member of the township office, and Wang Yunzhi, Zhang Zaihe, Shen Qishan, Zhao Jinbin, and other nine people at the Xin'an Guild Hall. All were taken to the security corps and transferred to the Jiading Public Security Bureau. After interrogation, they confessed to selling military rice and obtaining three thousand yuan, which had been handed over to another maintenance association before the retreat as military reception expenses, handled by Fei Maoquan. They were escorted to Wuxi yesterday and sent directly to the division headquarters for detention, pending transfer to the military law office for trial and handling.</p>

Recently, they have been causing trouble everywhere in the urban and rural areas. The authorities have no way to provide relief. A series of robberies by deserters occurred near Xingfu the day before yesterday. Although the military police were dispatched to encircle and suppress them, the result was nothing. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 AM on the 19th, a bandit boat came to the Santiao Bridge area, about three miles outside the west gate of the city. The people in the boat all looked like villagers. They swarmed ashore, each holding rifles and flashlights, etc. They first entered Yan Dalin's house, turned over boxes and chests, and took away all the valuable ornaments. Then they went to Yan Shoushou's and Yan Baijin's houses next door and robbed them one after another. They left only after two hours. At that time, a boat from the Langgan Bridge class passed by in the Shanzhentang outside. It was also detained, boarded and searched. None of the passengers were spared. The boat owner Jin Lin and others were also beaten by the bandits. When the police team heard the news and rushed to the scene, the bandits had already fled far away. It is said that the total estimated loss is about four or five thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Hall Order to Maintain and Restore the Jimei Pawnshop: After the Jimei Pawnshop on West Street closed down, local agencies, in order to relieve the economic difficulties of the poor, organized a maintenance association and increased the capital by 100,000 yuan. They redeemed the pawned goods and were not allowed to transfer them to other uses. They reported the matter to the Industry Department for filing. On the 18th, after a meeting of various agencies, it was decided that the pawnshop would be responsible for restoring the pawn business on the 25th. It was forbidden to transfer the redeemed pawned goods for other uses. Personnel were dispatched to supervise the withdrawal every day and store them in the Xiecheng Bank for the restoration of the pawn business. If the Jimei Pawnshop refused, the county government would enforce the order according to the hall order, starting from July 19, supervise the withdrawal until the maintenance association and the Jimei Pawnshop reach an agreement and formally open the pawn business with joint investment.</p>

He reported to Regiment Commander Ding and called the Public Security Bureau, ordering the detective team to search everywhere and also telegraphed to neighboring counties for assistance.</p>
<p>A Murder Case, Family Ruined: Cai Qijin, a villager in Shagang Township, Section 3, was murdered by his wife last month. His brother reported to the county and opened the coffin for an autopsy. All the expenses for the corpse site were quite large. The district chief Wang Wenkui and the Weichang Chen Wangsen sold Cai Qijin's fields to Cai Xiaogen, obtaining 195 yuan, which was divided and used. Someone reported to the county, and the Weichang and the buyer Cai Xiaogen were arrested. After interrogation on the 17th, they all confessed that the district chief and the district assistant instructed them to dare to sell the fields.

<p>Opening of Price-controlled Grain to Help the Poor: Hangzhou's commerce has been declining recently, people's livelihood is declining, and the number of poor people has increased. Since the closure of the four porridge distribution factories a month ago, it has been planned to open price-controlled grain to help the poor. However, since the three warehouses in the provincial capital were occupied by the army, it was impossible to hold it, and it was postponed again and again. It has now been decided to open the grain sales starting today (21st). The Pinghu has been notified yesterday and licenses have been issued. They can go to various factories to buy rice with the licenses. The price is set at nine cents and five li per liter.</p>
<p>The Collapse of the Qiantang Sandbar Intensifies: The water of the Qiantang River is very rapid. In recent days, the mold rain has been continuous, and the water level has risen sharply. The sandbar on the north bank has been collapsing. From 11:00 AM on the 17th to 8:00 AM on the 18th, more than thirty feet of the sandbar along the Qiantang River outside Qintai Gate and Guanyintang collapsed. The water was less than three feet away from the stone embankment, and the situation was dangerous, as recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Unexpectedly, yesterday (20th) morning, more than two feet of the area near Muqiaotou near Guanyintang collapsed again, and the Shangbutou to Xiachelou and other places that had collapsed before totaled more than fifty feet. The rear part of the No. 87 water-carrying dam has been interrupted, and the situation is even more critical. After receiving the news, Mayor Zhao Zhiji, together with Zhang Zili, director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and Miao Weiyi, section chief, rushed to inspect the area and immediately collected 2,000 sacks and hired a large number of workers to repair them to avoid danger. Once the water level drops slightly, a water-carrying dam will be built to defend against it.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: On the 14th of this month, a few workers requested the Third Branch Office of our Association to ask the Machinery Factory to change the payment for coal for employees to be deducted at the end of the month, as they could not afford to pay for it in advance. At this time, only a few people acted out of line and messed up the desks, stools, and stationery of the office and our Association. Our Association has already taken appropriate measures and did not telegraph for assistance. I recently read a news item in your newspaper on the 17th about the destruction of the Trade Union Council. After investigation, this is not consistent with the facts. I am writing to request that you correct it. Sincerely, Trade Union Council of Tianjin-Pukou Railway.</p>
<p>Special Document</p>
<h3>A Word to Those Who Advocate Resuming Relations with Russia: Chen Qitian</h3>
<p>And a Question for Shen Bao Reporter Mr. Chen Binhe</p>
<p>China declared the severance of relations with Soviet Russia in December of the 16th year of the Republic due to Soviet Russia's use of its embassies and consulates to hide, supply, and direct communist rebellions. It has been three and a half years now. During the severance of relations, Russia used airplanes and artillery to attack China in the 18th year, causing the Sino-Soviet Conflict and forcing China to sign the Khabarovsk Agreement. As a result, China lost its rights and humiliated the country, which is not much different from the current Shanghai Agreement. According to the Khabarovsk Agreement, representatives of China and Russia met in the Russian capital to discuss the three major issues of Sino-Soviet trade, Sino-Soviet trade, and resumption of diplomatic relations. This Sino-Soviet meeting actually included the discussion of the issue of resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations. However, due to the difficulties and delays of the Russian government, the Chinese delegation, including Mo Dehui, stayed in the Russian capital for two years without any results, even a meeting could not be held, naturally there was no talk of resumption of diplomatic relations. However, after the September 18th Incident last year, due to China's great suffering from Japan's military pressure, Party and state leaders such as Wang Jingwei and Chen Youren released the air of resuming diplomatic relations with Russia or even allying with Russia, thus arousing the discussion of the issue of resuming diplomatic relations with Russia. In my report of October 31st of last year, I published an article "The Issue of Resuming Diplomatic Relations with Russia in the Voice of Anti-Japanese War" in the fifth issue of this newspaper (Minsheng Weekly). From the four aspects of the relationship between Japan and Russia, Russia's position in the international community, the history of China's severance of relations with Russia, and the situation of the communist bandits in China, I explained in detail that China should not resume diplomatic relations with Russia at present. And in the beginning of the article, I stated the fundamental attitude of our argument as follows:</p>
<p>"We will not ask what kind of people advocate resuming diplomatic relations with Russia, nor will we ask what the real background of the people who advocate resuming diplomatic relations with Russia is, but we must investigate what the interests of resuming diplomatic relations with Russia are for China. In the international community, in diplomatic maneuvering, we only need to take the interests of our own country as the premise, and we can change our minds at any time. Today, we ally with Country A to resist Country B, and tomorrow, we ally with Country B to resist Country A. This is a very common thing. If resuming diplomatic relations with Russia or even allying with Russia is really beneficial to China, we might as well resume diplomatic relations or ally with Russia to overcome the current difficulties. If resuming diplomatic relations with Russia or even allying with Russia is not enough to overcome the current difficulties and is enough to increase the danger of the country, then we must resolutely oppose it."</p>
<p>Half a year has passed since the publication of this article. Although there have been occasional arguments in favor of or against it, few have explained the reasons for or against it in detail. Therefore, this newspaper has not added any further discussion. However, now the government seems to have a tendency to resume diplomatic relations with Russia (the statements of the responsible personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the issue of Russia before and after are evidence). At the same time, the people also have a firm Zhang to resume diplomatic relations with Russia. Whether immediately resuming diplomatic relations with Russia is beneficial or harmful to China, whether it is more beneficial than harmful to China, or less beneficial than harmful to China, before the actual implementation of the resumption of diplomatic relations, we should still discuss it in the long run. Recently, the person who has been most vigorously advocating resuming diplomatic relations with Russia is probably Shen Bao reporter Mr. Chen Binhe. He wrote five current affairs commentaries in Shen Bao (see note 1), saying in a very affirmative tone, "We strongly advocate the immediate resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union" (see note 2), "We strongly advocate the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and deeply hope that the authorities will break through all obstacles and resolutely promote its realization." And he criticized those who oppose the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia as "overly cautious," as "shortsighted," as "cowardly," as "complacent," as "conservative," as "seemingly right but actually wrong," as "seemingly more emotional and biased, but less calm and steady." For Shen Bao, which is known for being "overly cautious," "cowardly," and "conservative," to have such a resolute tone of current affairs commentary, I cannot help but admire Mr. Chen Binhe's courage. However, whether Mr. Chen's proposal is right or not, we believe that there is still a great need for discussion. Da Wan Bao reporter Zeng Xubai has discussed with Mr. Chen again and again, and we may as well join the battle group and presumptuously participate in the final discussion. Before joining the battle group, we want to agree with Mr. Chen on two things as follows:</p>
<p>First, no matter what the proposal is, it must be based on the interests of China itself as the fundamental principle. In detail, it must be clear whether immediately resuming diplomatic relations with Russia is more beneficial than harmful to China, or less beneficial than harmful to China. If it is more beneficial than harmful, then it is not a bad idea to immediately resume diplomatic relations. If it is more harmful than beneficial, then it is absolutely not appropriate to immediately resume diplomatic relations. In any case, the proposal must be judged by the interests of the country as the standard.</p>
<p>Second, no matter what the proposal is, according to what Mr. Chen said, "We should calmly and practically discuss this issue." Mr. Chen should no longer criticize those who oppose the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia as "shortsighted" or "conservative." We will also never criticize those who advocate the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia as "impulsive" or "opportunistic." Both sides should suppress emotional arguments so that people can understand the results of the discussion.</p>
<h3>Is the So-Called New Diplomatic Policy Resuming Relations with Russia?</h3>
<p>Since the violent Japanese occupied the Northeast, the situation in the Pacific has become more and more tense, and China's fate has become more and more precarious. If we want to save the precarious national destiny in the tense situation, we naturally need to think of basic methods in politics, military affairs, economy, education, etc. In addition, we also need to think of auxiliary methods in diplomatic strategies. No one can object to this. Therefore, Mr. Chen's so-called "Establishing a new diplomatic policy as soon as possible to deal with the great disaster of the coming day" can also be agreed upon in principle. However, is Mr. Chen's so-called "new diplomatic policy" resuming relations with Russia? Is it also allying with Russia? After rereading Mr. Chen's five current affairs commentaries, it seems to be a clear proposal to resume diplomatic relations, a vague proposal to ally with Russia, and afraid that people will say that his so-called resumption of diplomatic relations is an alliance with Russia. Mr. Chen said, "Resuming diplomatic relations is not allying with the Soviet Union, let alone tolerating the communists, but to restore ordinary diplomatic relations. This is common sense. We should never have any misunderstandings."</p>
<p>That's right, from the perspective of common sense, resuming diplomatic relations is just "Restoring ordinary diplomatic relations." However, from the perspective of the past history of China and Russia and the situation of the communist party in China under the command of Russia, resuming diplomatic relations with Russia, in addition to "Restoring ordinary diplomatic relations," there are other important relationships, which will be discussed later. Let us assume that Mr. Chen's so-called resumption of diplomatic relations is limited to "Restoring ordinary diplomatic relations." Then, we would like to ask Mr. Chen, is just "Restoring ordinary diplomatic relations" with Russia worthy of being called a "new diplomatic policy"? Is it even more worthy of "Dealing with the great disaster of the coming day"? If it is said that only resuming diplomatic relations with Russia is sufficient to be called a "new diplomatic policy" and can "deal with the great disaster of the coming day," then Britain, the United States, and even Japan, which used military force to invade China, all had "ordinary diplomatic relations" with China long ago. Why can't they save China from danger? In the past, China had resumed diplomatic relations with Russia, but it was not enough to save China from danger, but instead increased China's danger. It can be seen that only restoring ordinary diplomatic relations with Russia can never "deal with the great disaster of the coming day" and is not enough to be called a "new diplomatic policy." Mr. Chen may also understand that only restoring ordinary diplomatic relations with Russia is not called any new diplomatic policy. Therefore, Mr. Chen also said, "May I ask, where is our country today in diplomacy? Is it not completely isolated? Under such a severe situation, will it sit and wait for the slaughter of strong neighbors? Or should it establish a new diplomatic policy as soon as possible to deal with the great disaster of the coming day? Today, the current pressure on our country is Japan. The new diplomatic policy should be based on uniting with the nations that treat me equally and protecting the integrity of territorial and administrative sovereignty. France has already had understanding with Japan, and Britain and Italy are also unable to look to the East. Although the conflict between the United States and Japan is intensifying day by day, the United States can be regarded as my allied country, but there is also the worry that the whip is beyond reach. The Soviet Union is the most noteworthy actor in the Pacific problem. Since its revolution, it has automatically declared the abandonment of the unequal treaties concluded with me in the old Russian era, and it is geographically a natural allied country of mine, which is beyond doubt. My resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union can have the effect of mutual dependence in the diplomatic situation. Germany and Turkey have broken through the difficult situation in diplomacy by communicating with the Soviet Union, which is an example. If the two major countries with large land, abundant resources, and large populations resume diplomatic relations, the situation in the Pacific will change greatly. Therefore, if my country is unwilling to sit and wait for slaughter today, then the new diplomatic policy must be based on this."</p>
<p>In this paragraph, the so-called "allied country," the so-called "the Soviet Union is the most noteworthy actor in the Pacific problem, and it is geographically a natural allied country of mine," the so-called "the new diplomatic policy must be based on this," etc., are simply "ally with Russia," and it is definitely not just "resuming diplomatic relations." An allied country must first have diplomatic relations. Resuming diplomatic relations does not necessarily mean being an allied country. The great powers such as Britain, the United States, France, and Japan all have diplomatic relations with China, but almost none of them are truly counted as allied countries of China, and some are even enemy countries of China, such as Japan. Mr. Chen's so-called resumption of diplomatic relations, if it is limited to "Restoring ordinary diplomatic relations," then Russia cannot be immediately cited as an allied country. If it is recognized that "The Soviet Union is the only allied country of mine, and the new diplomatic policy must be based on this," then it is not a simple argument for resuming diplomatic relations. At least Mr. Chen's so-called resumption of diplomatic relations is a preparation for allying with Russia, not just limited to "Restoring ordinary diplomatic relations." The focus of Mr. Chen's so-called "new diplomatic policy" that should be discussed in the long run is not the simple argument for resuming diplomatic relations, but the argument for resuming diplomatic relations in preparation for allying with Russia. Speaking of allying with Russia or resuming diplomatic relations in preparation for allying with Russia, we must not forget the two historical lessons. The first time was Li Hongzhang's lesson in allying with Russia, and the second time was Sun Yat-sen's lesson in allying with Russia. The lesson of the first alliance with Russia is relatively far away, and it does not attract much attention. The lesson of the second alliance with Russia, such as China's isolation, the division of the party-state, the rampage of the communist bandits, etc., the bad consequences promoted by the alliance with Russia are still in front of us. Have we forgotten? "Forgetting the past is a teacher for the future." I want to advise Mr. Chen to think carefully about the historical lessons of the alliance with Russia, and he will surely be enlightened. It seems that Mr. Chen already knows that the historical lessons of the alliance with Russia still exist in the minds of ordinary people, and it is not convenient to directly propose the idea of allying with Russia, so he has to hide the idea of allying with Russia in the idea of resuming diplomatic relations in order to confuse the readers. I say this too deeply, or Mr. Chen may find it difficult to admit it, then I would like to ask Mr. Chen to carefully cancel the argument of resuming diplomatic relations in the name of allying with Russia, so as not to make the argument unclear and self-contradictory.</p>
<h3>2. Are Severing Relations, Aligning with Russia, and Accommodating the Communists Three Completely Separate Matters?</h3>
<p>From the above section, Mr. Chen's argument focuses on aligning with Russia to establish a so-called new diplomatic policy. His wording repeatedly emphasizes, "We believe that before discussing this issue, it is necessary to recognize that 'restoring diplomatic relations,' 'aligning with Russia,' and 'accommodating the Communists' are three separate matters and should not be lumped together, to avoid misleading readers." Indeed, according to common sense, restoring diplomatic relations, aligning with Russia, and accommodating the Communists are indeed three separate matters, not one. I recognize this. However, are these three matters completely unrelated, or are they interconnected? Before discussing this issue, we must also recognize this. The reason why restoring diplomatic relations, aligning with Russia, and accommodating the Communists are formally three separate matters is because of various instances where countries restore diplomatic relations with Russia without necessarily aligning with it, and align with Russia without necessarily accommodating the Communists. For example, Britain restored diplomatic relations with Russia but did not align with it, and Turkey aligned with Russia but did not accommodate the Communists. This allows us to clearly recognize this, without the need for repeated explanations. However, restoring diplomatic relations, aligning with Russia, and accommodating the Communists are absolutely not three completely unrelated matters but are closely interconnected. This is not easily recognized, and I fear that Mr. Chen Binghe has not fully recognized this point either.</p>
<p>Accommodating the Communists requires first aligning with Russia, and aligning with Russia requires first restoring diplomatic relations. This is their inevitable common relationship, which no one can deny. Moreover, under China's current special circumstances, once diplomatic relations with Russia are restored, there is bound to be a tendency towards aligning with Russia, and even accommodating the Communists. They have an even more special connection and cannot be regarded as three completely unrelated matters. Why do I say this? Firstly, because currently, the entire nation deeply resents Japan's tyranny and cannot think of a way to resist it on its own. It foolishly seeks a friendly country to cope with the current crisis. Now, the people who advocate restoring diplomatic relations with Russia are, with very few exceptions who have other backgrounds or agendas, mostly driven by this situation. Simply restoring diplomatic relations cannot break through China's diplomatic difficulties. Then, after restoring diplomatic relations, they will inevitably tend towards aligning with Russia. In the past, Li Hongzhang's alignment with Russia was intended to use Russia to resist Japan, but instead, he was used by Russia and could not resist Japan, leading to the situation where Russia and Japan divided the Northeast. Sun Yat-sen's alignment with Russia was intended to use Russia to overthrow imperialism, but as a result, white imperialism was not overthrown, and red imperialism instead penetrated deep into the hinterland, causing endless harm. Now, the people who advocate restoring diplomatic relations with Russia and aligning with Russia mostly fall within the scope of Li and Sun in terms of their psychological motivation, and they only want to use Russia to resist Japan. However, the fatal wound that red imperialist Soviet Russia inflicts on China is no less than that of white imperialist Japan. Japan created a puppet state to rule the Northeast, and Soviet Russia also created a puppet state to rule Outer Mongolia. Japan used violence to invade China, and Soviet Russia also used violence to attack China (the Sino-Soviet conflict). Japan used troops to oppress China on its borders, while Soviet Russia also used its plainclothes agents, the Communists, to disturb China's hinterland, causing China's long-term resistance against Japan to have worries about its rear. These are all facts. How can we reject the tiger at the front gate and welcome the wolf at the back door? Moreover, how can we welcome the wolf before the tiger is driven away? We recognize that those who firmly advocate restoring diplomatic relations at present mostly have a tendency towards aligning with Russia, and China's situation has the danger of moving towards aligning with Russia. Restoring diplomatic relations and aligning with Russia are indeed closely related, so we who firmly oppose aligning with Russia must also firmly oppose immediately restoring diplomatic relations.

<h3>Ministry of Military Affairs and Ordnance Department Decide to Abolish Shanghai Arsenal</h3>
<p>Various Machines to be Transported to Hankou, Gongxian, and Other Places</p>
<p>Buildings and Land to be Auctioned at Appraised Prices</p>
<p>Workers Elect Representatives to Plead for Rescission of Order</p>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal has been in operation for many years. During this time, there have been repeated wars in the country, and the factory has supplied a huge amount of ammunition. After the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, the factory was considered important and became a strategic target for military strategists, leading to the proposal by the former General Chamber of Commerce to stop building weapons and transform them into agricultural implements. However, this has not been implemented. After the January 28 Incident, due to environmental reasons, the factory dismantled and transported various machines to Hangzhou. After the armistice was signed, the factory workers repeatedly requested to move back and resume work, but these requests were not approved. Now, it is learned that the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ordnance Department have approved the German advisor's proposal to abolish the factory. The workers, upon hearing this news, sent representatives to Beijing yesterday to request the rescission of the order. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>History of the Arsenal: The Shanghai Arsenal was established in the third year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, upon the recommendation of Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang. It was initially located in Hongkou, with a very limited scope, only capable of repairing gun parts. Later, in the seventh year of Tongzhi, it was moved to Gaochangmiao, and the factory gradually expanded, with annual increases in output. After the founding of the Republic of China, civil wars broke out frequently in various provinces. During the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, the Shanghai Arsenal, as a military location, became a battleground for the two armies, and the Shanghai commercial market declined sharply. The former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Ministry of the Army in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China to abolish the factory and transform it into agricultural and industrial equipment. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Sun Chuanfang, as the commander-in-chief of the Five Provinces Allied Forces, ordered the factory to resume operations due to a shortage of weapons and ammunition. When the revolutionary army completed the Northern Expedition and the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it intended to reform the factory, adding machines and switching to electricity, resulting in a sudden increase in output. Apart from the Dongbei Arsenal, the Shanghai Arsenal was considered the best in the country.</p>
<p>January 28 Incident: After the January 28 Incident, the factory feared accidents and, in March, followed the order of the Ministry of Military Affairs to move all manufacturing machinery to Hangzhou. All 3,500 workers, except for the artillery factory, which still had dozens of old cannons and parts for fortress cannons to be repaired, with a portion of workers remaining in the factory for repairs, were dismissed with two months' severance pay from the factory.</p>
<p>Workers Request Resumption of Work: However, most of the factory workers were specialized craftsmen in the manufacture of weapons. This sudden dismissal left them with no way to make a living. Except for a few people who returned to their hometowns, most of the craftsmen stayed in the Gaochangmiao area, waiting for the arsenal to resume operations so that they could return to work. After the ceasefire agreement was signed, the factory union sent representatives to Beijing to petition, requesting the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ordnance Department to move the factory's machinery back as soon as possible to resume work. They were received by Director Zhou of the Ministry of Military Affairs' Public Relations Department and Section Chief Li of the Ordnance Department, who promised to forward their request and stated that the machinery would be moved back within three weeks. The union representatives were satisfied and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chiang Approves Abolition: Unexpectedly, recently, the former advisor to the factory, the German Mr. Brummell, submitted a memorandum to Chairman Chiang, proposing that the machinery of the Shanghai Arsenal be distributed to various arsenals, and that the original factory land, kitchens, etc., be auctioned off. Chiang approved this, and ordered the Ministry of Military Affairs to proceed. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Military Affairs, together with the Ordnance Department, held a meeting last week to discuss and decided to tender the machinery of the Shanghai Arsenal and transport it from Hangzhou to Nanjing, and then distribute it to the Hanyang, Jinling, and Gongxian factories. The German advisors Brummell, Kaber, and Dulwa, and the full-time members of the Ordnance Department, Tan Boyu and Zhuang Quan, were commissioned to go to Hangzhou to oversee the transportation.</p>
<p>Request for Rescission of Order: The factory workers were extremely alarmed upon hearing this news. They all believed that the Shanghai Arsenal was not only strategically important but also supplied military equipment to the southeastern provinces. At a time when the Communist bandits were rampant and national defense was strained, the sudden abolition of the factory and the interruption of military replenishment were a matter of concern, and the livelihoods of thousands of workers were even more worrisome. Therefore, they appointed Hu Sihong, Chief of the Audit Department, Wang Chengfou, Director of the Artillery Factory, and Lin Weirong, Director of the Gun Factory, to go to Beijing by overnight train last night to petition, requesting the cancellation of the decision. The union also had the directors of each factory proceed separately, hoping to work together to achieve the goal of rescinding the order.</p>
<h3>Puppet State Seizes Northeast Customs Duties</h3>
<p>Zhang Fuyun to Enter Beijing Soon to Request Instructions on Measures</p>
<p>The news that the puppet state wants to seize the Northeast customs duties has been circulating for a long time. However, it only withheld the surplus customs duties in the Bank of China, which was preserving the funds, to prevent them from being transferred south. According to a Changchun dispatch in yesterday's newspapers, Xi Qia, the finance minister of the puppet state, has officially issued a statement, ostensibly to establish customs autonomy, but in reality to seize the customs duties. The reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday separately interviewed Zhang Fuyun, the director of the Customs Administration, and Meierhe, the chief inspector of customs, to ask for their opinions on this matter. The responses of the two are recorded below:</p>
<p>Zhang Fuyun to Enter Beijing to Request Instructions: Zhang Fuyun, the director of the Customs Administration, has already received a formal telegram from the Northeast Customs regarding the news that the puppet state is seizing customs duties. Zhang will enter Beijing in the coming days to request instructions on this matter, and will determine how to negotiate after the central government instructs on measures. He is not willing to express his opinion at this time.</p>
<p>Meierhe Has No Comment: According to Meierhe, the chief inspector of customs, although he has received a report on this matter, he has no opinion to express. He apologizes and suggests that the reporter should ask the financial authorities of the National Government for their opinions. When the reporter asked what the British attitude was on this matter, Meierhe said that he had not heard of it and that the British consul should be consulted to find out the situation.</p>
<p>Report in the Great American Evening Post: The Great American Evening Post reported that the government of "Manchukuo" issued a declaration yesterday, intending to occupy the Chinese Customs at Dalian and other places in Manchuria. The reporter of the Great American Evening Post visited various administrative agencies in Shanghai this morning (the 20th) to inquire about this matter. The authorities did not comment on this matter but said that the National Government would act in accordance with the policies established at the Lushan Conference. Meierhe, the chief inspector of customs, also did not want to comment on this matter, saying that all news about this issue would only be released by the Ministry of Finance. Visiting the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance, it was only learned that the ministry was treating the "Manchukuo" declaration with indifference. Before the "Manchukuo" issued its declaration, it sent a note to the National Government on March 21, requesting that the customs of Dalian and other places in Manchuria be transferred to the management of the Manchurian authorities, with the same tax rates. The taxes collected, after deducting foreign debts, etc., would be handed over to Nanjing, and the remainder would belong to the "Manchurian government," with no changes in personnel. The National Government, adhering to the policy of non-recognition, did not reply.</p>
<h3>Two Important Documents from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Negotiating Compensation for Losses in Shanghai War</p>
<p>Notice Encouraging Saving for National Salvation Savings</p>
<p>Based on the resolutions of the member's general meeting, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the government to negotiate with Japan for compensation for the losses in the Shanghai War, and issued a notice to all industries to encourage saving for national salvation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Memorial: A memorial is hereby submitted. At the third member's general meeting held on June 18th, member Wang Yansong proposed, and Luo Qinghua and Ma Shaoquan seconded, stating that since the January 28th Incident, the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai relied on the concessions and suddenly attacked our troops. The war lasted for 34 days, and aircraft and heavy artillery were used, causing great destruction, loss of life, and devastation to homes, with estimated losses of more than 1.6 billion. Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places have been reduced to rubble, with no prospect of recovery. It is believed that the Japanese warlords, indulging in their violence, launched bombardments without first withdrawing their envoys or severing diplomatic relations, setting an unprecedented example in international relations. The heavy artillery and aircraft inflicted damage and destruction on civilians who were not combatants and buildings that were not defenses, in violation of international war regulations. It is proposed that the general meeting send a telegram to the National Government, seriously negotiate with Japan, demand compensation for losses, and guarantee that such violence will not occur again. The member's general meeting approved the case. An investigation found that the current armistice agreement only specifies the ceasefire method and does not discuss the responsibility for the Shanghai War or other related issues. Therefore, there is room to raise negotiations and demand compensation for the losses suffered by our country this time. The original proposal stated that without withdrawing envoys or severing diplomatic relations, the continuous attacks on our defense forces, as well as the wanton destruction of civilians who were not combatants and buildings that were not defenses, violated international law and international war regulations. There are solid reasons for demanding that Japan provide separate compensation. It is reasonable to prepare a document and request your court to investigate and instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to submit negotiations at the appropriate time, which is convenient for the public. Submitted to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Notice: Greetings. Previously, due to the Japanese occupation of the Northeast and Shanghai, this Chamber had a resolution on preparing war funds against Japan and the funding for the military by various industries for the sake of self-defense. Later, the Citizens' Federation sent a letter stating that although the ceasefire agreement had been signed, the national crisis and enemy atmosphere were getting worse. To declare national survival, it was urgent to initiate savings, and it had been decided to prepare staff to contact all sectors and request this Chamber to designate preparation personnel to guide the situation. It was considered that this matter was in line with the Chamber's previous resolution and was in principle in favor of it. However, long-term savings methods are different from temporary funds. According to the Chamber of Commerce Law and the same industry association regulations, increasing the burden on members must be approved by the member's general meeting. Therefore, the 91st standing committee submitted it to the 24th executive committee, requesting it to be discussed at the third member's general meeting on the 18th of this month. Now, the third member's general meeting has resolved that the executive committee should earnestly advise each industry to organize it themselves, and the method of custody should also be determined by each industry, as a case has been established. An investigation has found that now the Japanese are establishing a puppet state in the Northeast and the arrangements are becoming increasingly detailed. Their international rhetoric is also becoming increasingly forceful. In this situation, it is impossible to return our occupied territory without long-term and sustained confrontation. The general public believes that since the government has not decided to use troops, saving is like throwing money away. They do not know that modern large-scale wars must first seek self-sufficiency in military equipment and military materials and the convenience of aiding and requisitioning. Therefore, national defense plans must be based on heavy industry and the wide opening of motor roads. The Soviet Union's five-year plan is entirely a national defense plan, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Our country does not have such vast financial resources, and what is needed is only defensive national defense, so the scale is not so great. However, according to recent estimates by experts, such as steelmaking, copper smelting, nitric acid production, gasoline production, planning new arsenals, relocating old arsenals, and completing railways and motor roads related to national defense, a rough scale would cost around 200 million. Even if foreign debt is organized and private fundraising is carried out simultaneously, the needs are still very large. Recently, the government is actively carrying out state-owned steel plants and provincial highways, which cannot be said to be without long-term resistance preparations. Therefore, the national crisis savings cannot be said to be over in Shanghai, and the government has not decided to use troops in the Northeast, so they wait and see, stopping the organization, except for the separate letters. In response, we request that your association immediately invite colleagues from the same industry to discuss and organize, and the funds paid will be kept by each public association, but a proper storage method must be stipulated to avoid losses and misappropriation. This is our utmost hope. Sincerely,</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Actually Want to Occupy Four Places for a Long Time</h3>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Denies Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>According to a wire from the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Japanese Marines are in charge of guarding four locations: the Toyoda Spinning Factory in West Shanghai, the Dobun Shoin, the Gongda Spinning Factory on Pingliang Road, and the Huafeng Spinning Factory on Wusong Road. However, Chinese newspapers have reported that they can be withdrawn in a day or two, which is completely untrue. Even the chief of staff of the Kajima Special Naval Landing Force denies this statement.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Far Eastern News Agency specially visited the municipal government yesterday to inquire. It was said that regarding this issue, Yu Hongjun, the representative of our side in the joint committee, has sent a letter to the Japanese authorities to inquire, but has not yet received a reply. Therefore, judging from the situation, the Japanese side seems unwilling to withdraw for the time being.</p>
<h3>Northeast Rebels Insult Foreign Newspaper Reporters</h3>
<p>New York Times Shanghai Representative Sends Telegram to Protest</p>
<p>According to the Chinese Daily News, the authorities of Manchukuo now want to confiscate the notes and other news materials brought back to Harbin by Steele, the Manchurian correspondent of the New York Times, and Lind, a Swiss journalist, which may lead to a major diplomatic case. Steele and Lind recently visited General Ma Zhanshan, traveling for a total of 17 days. Unexpectedly, six days ago, the two had just returned to Harbin when they were surrounded by Manchukuo police and Japanese spies. Steele sought refuge in the American consulate, while Lind was arrested and subjected to six hours of torture under the direction of Japanese advisors. The rooms in their hotel were also searched by the police, and all letters, photos, passports, and credentials were confiscated. On Saturday, after Lind met with them, he asked the French consul, who was acting on behalf of Swiss nationals, to negotiate and demand the return of the letters and passports and an apology from the Manchukuo Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As for Steele, the Harbin police, under the direction of Japanese advisors, accused him of carrying secret documents from General Ma Zhanshan to Lord Lytton of the investigation team and Zhang Xueliang in Beiping. On Friday, Steele submitted the documents he had brought back from General Ma Zhanshan's headquarters to the Harbin authorities for review. However, it was agreed in advance that they could only be translated in Steele's presence and that no copies could be made. After the review, they should be returned to the original owner immediately. Unexpectedly, the Japanese and Manchukuo authorities violated the agreement and refused to return the documents, which had been reviewed by the American Consul General in Harbin. These included handwritten notes of the questions and answers between General Ma and Steele during their meeting, and several Chinese documents, including one in which General Ma Zhanshan stated the reasons for his campaign against the Manchurian government. They wanted to withhold them and not return them. The Harbin Japanese Daily went even further, falsely accusing the American Consul General Hanson of protecting Steele and Lind and interfering in the political activities of Manchukuo, saying that the Japanese authorities had obtained confirmation that after the two returned to Harbin, they rushed to the American Consulate General, and the American Consul General sent a coded telegram on behalf of Ma Zhanshan to Lord Lytton and Zhang Xueliang, and requested that Steele and Lind be deported and not allowed to return. It is reported that Aiping, the Shanghai representative of the New York Times, telegraphed Honjo, the commander of the Japanese army in Shenyang, and Kawasaka, the Japanese advisor in Changchun, on Saturday morning to protest the treatment of Steele, and went to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai twice to protest to the Japanese acting consul.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Dismissal Dispute of the Workers of the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>Conclusion of a Settlement Contract</p>
<p>The dismissal case of the workers of the Commercial Press was previously approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, and more than 250,000 yuan from the severance fund were distributed in full, and an additional half-month's salary was issued. The payments were scheduled to be made long ago. The Commercial Press has successively sent more than 600,000 yuan to the dismissed workers. However, the relief committee for the workers of the publishing industry and the Commercial Press expressed dissatisfaction and hired lawyers to prepare for litigation. This has been reported in this newspaper repeatedly. Now, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and others have worked hard to mediate, and a settlement contract has been concluded, which was signed on the evening of the 17th, and lawyers Li Zuyu, Guo Wei, and Chen Qun were present to sign and certify. The contract terms are as follows: (1) Both parties acknowledge the binding effect of Decree No. 1829 of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.

<h3>Telephone Workers in the International Settlement to Hold a General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>To Discuss and Decide Whether to Persist in the Strike or Not</p>
<p>A Few Workers Resumed Work Yesterday</p>
<p>After the strike of the telephone company workers in the International Settlement, the strike committee, due to a small number of workers resuming work without authorization, issued an emergency order yesterday, scheduling a mass meeting this morning to solicit opinions and decide whether to persist in the strike. The police were ordered to prevent it. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Few Return to Work: Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Public Concession police, fearing that workers would stage a demonstration in front of the company, temporarily imposed martial law in front of the company on Fujian Road. By 11:00 AM, as the workers postponed the demonstration, they immediately withdrew. The company persuaded workers to return to work unconditionally. As a result, yesterday morning, 14 people from the new Central Branch on Fujian Road, 6 people from the Fanan Branch on Bi Xun Road, and 5 people from the Bei Xing Branch on Hai Ning Road resumed work. The Concession police also increased the number of detectives to protect those who returned to work, which shook the solidarity of the entire workforce. Workers from the Far Eastern Hotel crowded to inquire about the news.</p>
<p>Strike Committee Orders: The strike committee issued an emergency order stating: "Workers, we must adhere to a unified strike and only resume work when our conditions are met. Currently, running dogs are spreading rumors everywhere, saying that the strike committee has ordered us to go to work, which is completely untrue. We hope you will not easily believe the rumors. Tomorrow (the 21st) at 10:00 AM, we will discuss solutions at Room 513 on the fifth floor of the Far Eastern Hotel. Attendance is essential. This order, June 20, 21st year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>General Meeting This Morning: A member of the strike committee told a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday: "Currently, the striking workers are criticizing the strike committee for its past ineffectiveness and its distance from the workers. In addition, influenced by foremen and capitalists, a small number of workers have resumed work without authorization, leading to internal disagreements. The strike committee has now decided to hold a mass meeting on the 21st to solicit the opinions of all workers: (1) If the workers support the basic conditions and oppose unconditional resumption of work, they will resolutely discuss effective measures to deal with the situation; (2) If the workers believe that the future of the strike is dangerous and advocate unconditional resumption of work, expressing painful submission to the imperialist capitalists, then they will decide to resume work first. However, the strike committee will abide by the opinions of all workers. Even though a portion of the workers have resumed work, it has not fundamentally affected the future of the strike."</p>
<p>Police Prohibition: After the strike committee announced that it would hold a mass meeting at 10:00 AM this morning, the Public Concession police, fearing that disputes would arise during the meeting, dispatched two Western officers and one Chinese detective to Room 513 on the fifth floor of the Far Eastern Hotel at 4:30 PM yesterday, claiming, "By order of the police, we prohibit you from holding a general meeting here tomorrow. If you want to hold one, you can go to the South City Public Sports Ground." They also tore off the strike committee's order posted on the wall and immediately withdrew. The strike committee will temporarily notify the meeting venue after it has been decided.</p>
<p>Basic Conditions: The basic conditions proposed by the strike committee are as follows: (1) Increase wages: add ten yuan for those below twenty yuan, add eight yuan for those below thirty yuan, and add five yuan for those below forty yuan. (2) Oppose the dismissal of workers and reinstate the workers dismissed after May 30th of this year, with wages paid as usual. (3) Recognize the union as the full representative of the workers, and the company will subsidize 600 yuan per month for union expenses. (4) Wages will be paid as usual during the strike. (5) Savings and six months of severance pay will be handed over to the workers themselves for safekeeping. (6) Female workers will be given two months of rest before and after childbirth, with wages paid as usual, and a childbirth allowance of 50 yuan will be provided. The strike committee now insists on items 1, 2, and 3, and the rest can be conceded.</p>
<p>Emergency Notice: The representative assembly on June 16th resolved that "all telephone workers" should unite to oppose the common enemy, the capitalists, and strive for the victory of the conditions. Therefore, it was decided to establish a unified and responsible representative assembly and an expanded and unified strike committee representing all workers. First, each department must now elect responsible representatives, especially the presidium of the strike committee must include representatives from each department. Therefore, the presidium is entrusted to immediately convene a general assembly of workers from each department, with representatives from the presidium participating, to elect representatives in proportion to the number of workers in each department, with one representative for every 30 workers, to first organize a representative assembly, which will be the highest organ of the strike committee. The decisions of the assembly must be obeyed by everyone. The representative assembly will elect the strike committee, and the members of the strike committee must guarantee that representatives from each department participate. Departments with fewer than 100 workers will elect two people, and departments with more than 100 workers will elect three people to organize a responsible strike committee. All work during the strike will be practically led by the strike committee. After receiving this notice, workers in each department are requested to immediately prepare to participate in the general election meeting of each department convened by the secretariat of the presidium (time and location to be notified separately) to elect their trusted representatives to participate in the representative assembly and the strike committee. These representatives: (1) Must truly fight for the six major conditions and the preliminary labor-management agreement, and must never surrender to the capitalists. (2) Must be genuine line workers, not outsiders, not scab dogs. (3) Must obey strike discipline, not negotiate privately, not go to work without authorization, and must obey the orders of the strike committee. (4) If any of the above conditions are violated, or other actions are taken that undermine the strike, the presidium may submit it to the representative assembly and hand it over to the strike court for punishment, and convene a general meeting of all workers in the department to remove their representative and elect a new representative. Workers in each department must oppose those who divide the unity of the workers' united front and those who incite workers to boycott the election assembly.</p>
<p>Company's Response: The Shanghai Telephone Company yesterday told the workers (the following statement is in response to questions from some workers): (1) Dismissal: There has been no unreasonable dismissal in the past, and there will definitely be no such thing in the future. However, the company cannot do it and definitely cannot allow avoiding the necessity of layoffs, and this layoff plan has not yet been completed. There are three reasons for this necessary layoff: (A) Many workers were hired because of changes in the automatic machines, planning various buildings and their work. (B) This renovated telephone organization requires fewer workers than the old system. (C) The company's finances are tight, and it has to try its best to save expenses. (2) Salary Increase in April: The company cannot agree to annual automatic salary increases, as salary increases depend entirely on work performance and the company's financial situation. (3) Wages During the Strike: The company has already stated that wages cannot be paid during the strike. This applies equally to those who strike voluntarily and those who strike reluctantly. (4) Wages for Sundays and Holidays: The company is a public utility, so it must work day and night regardless of holidays, so work within the specified working hours cannot be calculated as extra work days. As for work outside the specified working hours, it will be handled in accordance with the regulations. The company is a public utility, so it has to refine various organizations and management. A good worker who is dismissed due to a lack of company work can receive what they deserve from the public accumulation fund. The workers have not contributed any money to this public accumulation fund. However, it should be noted that temporary short-term workers and workers who have not worked for two years are not entitled to this fund. Workers who refuse to work will have their eligibility for the fund and other benefits revoked. Wages: A good worker who is dismissed due to a lack of work will be given one month's wages in addition to the wages they deserve. (5) Regarding changes to sick leave and other leave requests, the company does not deem it necessary to make any changes. However, if workers submit a request for changes after returning to work in accordance with the company's appropriate procedures, the company will naturally be willing to consider such requests. (6) Annual Bonus: The company has no plans to change the annual bonus. This bonus was issued in February of this year. In short, this issue depends entirely on the company's economic situation. (7) Death and Injury Issues: The answer is the same as item 5. The company believes that the workers are indeed being misled by unscrupulous elements, as the above issues and the statements of the strike committee are sufficient to prove this point. The following table lists various inaccurate facts that have been disseminated to the workers: (1) When China and Japan are at war, extra work is often done, but the company does not pay extra wages. Answer: Incorrect. (2) The company only provides free food to workers in the northern district. Answer: Incorrect. (3) The company temporarily installs telephones in each household every day, which is a plan for the company to profit from. Answer: Incorrect. (4) The company has a deficit. Answer: Incorrect. (5) The public accumulation fund has been cancelled. Answer: Incorrect. (6) The public accumulation fund is deducted from the employees' wages. Answer: Incorrect. (7) The company has hired hundreds of White Russians to replace Chinese workers. Answer: Incorrect. (8) The company is currently planning to replace Chinese workers with White Russians. Answer: Incorrect. (9) The automatic machine equipment has not been damaged. Answer: Incorrect. (10) All three thousand workers have gone on strike. Answer: Incorrect. (11) The strike committee represents the will of all the workers. Answer: Incorrect. (12) This strike has the consent of all three thousand workers. Answer: Incorrect. There are also false rumors that the strikers are being used by the capitalists. In fact, the workers have received excellent treatment, while those who supply capital receive very little reward, or it can even be said that they receive none at all. Serving at this company is not difficult and can be compared with other public utilities. The company's wages are also appropriate and paid on time. Working hours are not excessive. As for promotions, they are naturally carried out reasonably within a prosperous company.</p>
<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Presents a Flag to the Shanghai Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Gives a Sincere Speech</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM on June 20th, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, accompanied by Yuan Ludeng, arrived at the Public Works Department to present a flag to the International Volunteer Corps in recognition of their services in the recent Sino-Japanese conflict. The flag was escorted by Chinese Boy Scouts and a band to the drill ground of the Volunteer Corps. At that time, representatives of each company of the Volunteer Corps came out to receive it. Then, the Boy Scouts lined up on Fuzhou Road, facing north, and the Volunteer Corps officers were on their east. Wang and Yuan then entered the field from the Volunteer Corps Club, accompanied by Commander Thomas, Deputy Commander McMicaga, and Majors Wu and Xu, and Captain Sinclair. Then, Wang Xiaolai raised the flag and presented it to Commander Thomas, and delivered the following speech:</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech: Since Shanghai was opened as a treaty port and the International Settlement was established, it has experienced two international wars, and the Chinese and foreign residents in the Settlement have enjoyed peace and order without experiencing the panic of war. The first of these two wars was 49 years ago, and the second was 38 years ago. Among the foreign merchants in Shanghai today, there must be those who have been in business for a long time and have personally experienced these two wars. Recalling these two wars, although the time elapsed was more than eight months, more than a year, the commerce of the Yangtze River and the International Settlement jointly operated have been highly valued. Therefore, although China at that time also increased its defenses at the Wusong Fort, it did not affect the Settlement in the slightest, which shows that since China signed treaties with various countries, it has always protected and valued the areas of public commerce of various countries. This policy has not changed to this day, even at the cost of great sacrifices, and it still endures and restrains itself to the extreme. Therefore, although the Public Settlement has encountered major difficulties this year, events that were unimaginable 49 and 38 years ago, it has still been able to preserve this area that has been painstakingly managed for 80 to 90 years, so that it does not become a ruin. I believe that there are two main reasons for this: one is that the Chinese army has extreme tolerance and truly embraces the spirit of loving others as oneself and loving one's enemies as oneself, and the other is that the International Volunteer Corps has real defensive strength and its spirit of volunteering and serving the public. Therefore, this Chamber is holding a flag presentation ceremony in admiration to express its intention to never forget this. I will also restate China's consistent respect for the security of the Settlement and the history of the Settlement's security being respected, and express my deep expectations for the future. I believe that everyone present will share the same feelings.</p>
<p>Thomas's Response: After Wang's speech, Commander Thomas replied, "I am deeply honored to accept this beautiful flag presented by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce on behalf of the Volunteer Corps. We are also deeply grateful that Mr. Wang has taken the trouble to come in person. The presence of representatives from each company today is to show the Volunteer Corps' consistent spirit of protecting the Settlement. The Volunteer Corps is a servant of the Public Works Department. In its service, it knows nothing about political issues. Its goal is only to maintain security and protect the lives and property of residents, regardless of their nationality. In the future, with this flag, everyone will forever remember the friendly relationship between the Volunteer Corps and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and will always cherish it."</p>
<h3>Management Rights for Roads Built Beyond the Boundary</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Is Actively Recalling Them</p>
<p>The Opposition Is Weak</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that recently, the authorities in this city have been actively negotiating the issue of roads built beyond the boundary and are about to reclaim the right of management. However, voices of opposition are rampant. Believing that this case is of great importance to the gain or loss of national sovereignty, the reporter specifically asked someone familiar with the administrative situation of this city about the truth of the opposition from all parties. I am grateful that this person analyzed and informed me. The details of the conversation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the opponents in this case are of complex composition. The most prominent are the Japanese. Since the ceasefire, the Japanese in Shanghai and Tokyo have echoed each other, vigorously advocating the opening of a round table conference to solve the Shanghai problem. Their main purpose is to implement their claim that Shanghai should not be garrisoned and should be established as a free city. Therefore, they are also doing their best to oppose China's reclaiming the right to manage roads built beyond the boundary. At the same time, there is also a part of Westerners who believe that China's reclaiming the right to manage roads built beyond the boundary is the prelude to reclaiming the concession. In order to preserve the concession, they are unwilling to give up even the right to manage roads built beyond the boundary. There is also a part of Chinese who own real estate in the area of roads built beyond the boundary. They believe that once the right of management is reclaimed, the land price will fall. For the sake of private interests, they do not hesitate to act as accomplices and help the opposition. There is also a small part of Chinese who are related to politics and have always lived or owned property in that area. They believe that after the right to manage roads built beyond the boundary is reclaimed, the Chinese police can exercise their powers, which is detrimental to their political activities, so they also secretly oppose it. However, since the opponents are of extremely complex composition and have different aspirations, their strength is very weak. The principle of the municipal government's negotiations this time is not to abandon sovereignty. When we look at the current situation of guests dominating hosts on roads built beyond the boundary, we feel even more that this issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Takeover Committee Is Preparing to Conclude</h3>
<p>A Meeting Was Held Yesterday to Discuss Compiling a General Report</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that, with the exception of the Xiangzi-stationed area, the Tongwen Academy, the Toyota Yarn Factory, the Gongda Yarn Factory, the Rihua Yarn Factory, and the Huafeng Yarn Factory, which have not yet been taken over in the Songhu war zone, all other places have been taken over. The Takeover Committee will conclude as soon as the above-mentioned places have been taken over. Before the conclusion, the committee will collect takeover reports from all parties and compile them into a book as a general report on the work of the Takeover Committee. The committee specifically convened a meeting of relevant parties at the United Press at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the matter. The attendees included Chairman Yin Rugeng, Secretary Wu Hong, He Yiyi, Yin Tixin, Zhao Zhihua Special Commissioner Cha Nan Zhang, Director of the Health Bureau Shen Gao, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau Sun Yongyi, representative of the Education Bureau Ma Chonggan, representative of the Public Utilities Bureau Gu Zhenbai, representative of the Land Bureau Jing Song, representative of the Finance Bureau Liang Sicheng, representative of the Two Roads Administration Bureau Ding Zhenheng, representative of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company Shen Mingpan, and representative of the Telephone Bureau Wang Zixing, and more than ten others. Chairman Yin Rugeng decided that the various bureaus of the municipal government, the Two Roads Administration Bureau, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and the Telephone Bureau, and other relevant parties should first draft detailed takeover reports and send them to the Takeover Committee, and then the Takeover Committee will collect the reports and search for photos taken during the takeover to be responsible for compiling a general report. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Four Organizations Convene a Meeting to Promote the Abolition of the Civil War Alliance</h3>

<h3>The Municipal Government Promulgates the Organizational Regulations for the Provisional Council</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Has Approved and Recorded Them</p>
<p>In the 16th year of the Republic of China, when the Shanghai Municipal Government was established, it was approved by the National Government to establish a Municipal Council. The council was established not long ago, but it was terminated due to changes in the Municipal Organization Law. At the beginning of Mayor Wu's tenure, he realized that the organization of the Municipal Council was very important. After the Shanghai Incident occurred on January 28th of this year, areas with a large population gradually became war zones, and other areas that were not directly affected by the war were also greatly affected due to the war. After this, local reconstruction must be carried out jointly with local talents. This organization is becoming increasingly urgent and cannot be delayed. Therefore, Mayor Wu drafted organizational regulations for the Provisional Municipal Council, referring to the promulgated Municipal Organization Law, to temporarily establish the council before the election is completed, in order to meet the current needs and enable the spirit of local autonomy to develop gradually. On April 5th, he drafted the Organizational Regulations for the Shanghai Municipal Provisional Council and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan then sent them to the Ministry of Interior for review. On May 9th, the Central Political Conference passed the case for Shanghai to establish a Provisional Council, with a quota of 15 to 19 people and a term of office until the establishment of a formal council. The candidates will be selected by the Municipal Government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and appointment. The Municipal Government immediately re-drafted ten organizational regulations based on this resolution and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for record on June 9th. It is now known that the Executive Yuan has issued an order approving the record a few days ago. The organizational regulations of the council are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations for the Shanghai Municipal Provisional Council: Article 1: In order to gather the strength of the people and actively develop municipal administration, a Provisional Municipal Council shall be temporarily established before the Municipal Council is established in accordance with the law. Article 2: The Provisional Municipal Council shall have 15 to 19 councilors, who shall be selected by the Municipal Government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and appointment. Article 3: The term of office of the members of the Provisional Municipal Council shall be until the date of establishment of the Municipal Council. They shall be unpaid. Article 4: The Provisional Municipal Council shall have one speaker, who shall be elected by the members of the Municipal Council. Article 5: The Municipal Government shall submit the following matters to the Provisional Municipal Council for discussion: (1) Matters concerning municipal special laws and regulations; (2) Matters concerning the municipal budget and final accounts; (3) Matters concerning the consolidation of municipal financial revenue and the raising of municipal public bonds; (4) Matters concerning the management of municipal public property and public enterprises; (5) Other important matters. Article 6: The Provisional Municipal Council shall hold regular meetings twice a year, but special meetings may be convened at the request of one-third of the members of the Municipal Council or when the speaker deems it necessary. Article 7: The detailed organizational rules and rules of procedure of the Provisional Municipal Council shall be determined by the Provisional Municipal Council. Article 8: The Provisional Municipal Council shall be abolished when the Municipal Council is established in accordance with the law. Article 9: If there are any matters not covered in these Regulations, they may be amended at any time. Article 10: These Regulations shall be implemented from the date of approval and record by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>The Consulate in Yokohama Sends Overseas Chinese Back to China</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association received a letter from the Shanghai Shipping Bureau yesterday, stating that it had received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications approving a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after consultation with the Da Lai Company, for ships sailing through Japanese ports to carry distressed overseas Chinese back to China each time. The reply telegram from the Consulate in Yokohama stated that there are more than 300 overseas Chinese to be sent back, and they plan to be transported back to Shanghai from Yokohama on the 20th and 24th of this month and the 8th of July. The Shanghai hometown associations should be asked to help take care of them when the ships arrive in Shanghai. After receiving the letter, the association inquired with the Da Lai Company about the names and dates of the ships arriving in Shanghai. It is now known that the Pusidwb Wiloon ship departed from Yokohama on June 20th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on June 24th. The Pusidwb Jeffuroow ship departed from Yokohama on June 24th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on June 28th. The Pusidwb Modisen ship departed from Yokohama on July 8th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on July 12th. All ships will dock at the Da Lai Wharf. In addition to sending personnel to take care of them when they arrive, the association also sent letters to the hometown associations and organizations in Shanghai, requesting them to send personnel to the above-mentioned ships on time when they arrive at the port to receive the overseas Chinese of their respective hometowns and arrange for their accommodation or send them back to their hometowns to avoid displacement.</p>
<h3>The Songhu Road Underwent a Test Run Yesterday</h3>
<p>Traffic Will Resume Tomorrow</p>
<p>The railway bridge over the Yunzaobang on the Songhu Road was completely repaired yesterday morning. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, the road's vehicle department specially released a test train that went directly to Baotaiwan, and sent Tang Huannan, the section chief of the resident office, to inspect the train. It returned to Shanghai at around 5:00 PM. It was heard that the engineering aspect was very solid, so the office decided to resume all Songhu traffic from tomorrow (the 22nd). It was also learned that although the Baotaiwan station site has been bombed, there are still empty houses next to the station that can be used. The Wusongzhen station building is still intact.</p>

<h3>Fundraising for Northeast Volunteer Army by the Shangyi Troupe</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Five Hundred Yuan from Twenty-Six Schools</p>
<p>The Shangyi Troupe of this city is a very small women's organization, with only a dozen or so members in total. However, they are quite enthusiastic about national salvation work. Recently, they held a school fundraising campaign for the Northeast Volunteer Army. With the support of school principals and students who directly or indirectly knew the troupe members in Shanghai schools, the fundraising was held on the 15th of this month. Some schools from other cities also joined (but the dates were not fixed). On the 16th, the opening was held at the "Life Weekly" magazine office. In addition to Xu Ai, the Director of the Business Department and the Director of the General Affairs Department of the magazine, representing Zou Taofen to oversee, there were also more than twenty school representatives. The result was that twenty-six schools donated a total of more than two thousand five hundred yuan (detailed figures can be found in today's advertisement column). It can be seen that the schools are enthusiastic about the cause of national salvation. All the donations received will be entrusted to the "Life Weekly" magazine to be sent to the Northeast. The expenses during the preparation were all planned by the troupe itself, except for the stationery donated by the Zhonghua Book Company.</p>
<h3>Wu Banchang and Others Comforted the Citizens' Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Wu Banchang, Chen Guangxiang, Wang Zhaocheng, Liu Zhongying, and other members of the Shanghai Citizens' Volunteer Army Committee hosted a banquet at the Ninth District Branch of the Citizens' Federation on Baker Road yesterday at 6 p.m. in their private capacities to celebrate the Shanghai Citizens' Volunteer Army's participation in the frontline battles. During the banquet, Wu Banchang delivered a speech, stating that the brutal Japanese violated conventions and destroyed peace, invading the Northeast and then Shanghai. All Chinese people were indignant. He added that they were inspired by righteousness and patriotism, abandoned their homes to join the army, sacrificed themselves for righteousness, and gave their lives for the frontier. Their spirit of seeking survival for the nation and disregarding life and death was admirable. Now that they had returned victorious and laid down their arms, they prepared a humble banquet to comfort them for their meritorious anti-Japanese efforts. Chen Guangxiang, Wang Zhaocheng, Liu Zhongying, and others then delivered speeches, mostly praising them. Afterward, representatives of the Volunteer Army, Wu Zhenmin, Cai Yaozu, Xu Xibiao, Yun Huifang, Wu Jingming, Zhang Jingdong, and others responded and reported on the battles. The meeting also included a thorough discussion of future anti-Japanese work plans. The banquet ended happily at around 10 p.m.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the National Wireless Radio Station Staff Tongyi Association of the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>The Tongyi Association of staff members of the Shanghai General Station of the Ministry of Communications has been established for more than a year and has made many achievements in its work. This time, it was selected as the National Wireless Radio Station Staff Tongyi Association. After receiving the notification, the association immediately printed and distributed election ballots to elect executive committee members of the General Association. As a result, Xie Chunpu and eight others were elected. It was reported that the first meeting was held the day before yesterday (the 18th). The details of the General Association are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparations: For the purpose of strengthening unity, the staff of various wireless radio stations across the country under the Ministry of Communications have organized staff Tongyi Associations. As of last year, more than twenty Tongyi Associations had been established in various radio stations. However, feeling that their power was weak and lacking a central organization, the Tongyi Association of the Hankou Radio Station initiated the organization of the National Wireless Radio Station Staff Tongyi Association of the Ministry of Communications last summer, as more than two-thirds of the Tongyi Associations of radio stations across the country had been established. This initiative was unanimously supported by the radio stations. The Hankou Radio Station was elected as the preparatory committee. After being elected, the station immediately began preparations. However, the radio stations were scattered throughout the country, and consultations by letters and telegrams took a lot of time. In addition, the Hankou floods last autumn affected the preparations. Now the General Association's constitution has long been passed. According to the provisions of the constitution, in addition to the Supervisory Committee, which is composed of seven representatives selected by each radio station, the Executive Committee is responsible for the production by each radio station. The preparatory committee immediately printed and distributed election ballots and held a national general election. As a result, the Shanghai Station and the Hankou Station each received five votes and could not be determined. Another runoff election was held, and as a result,</p>
<p>List of Committee Members: Qingdao, Xiamen, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Yichang, Tianjin, Fuzhou, and other seven stations were elected as Supervisory Committee members, with Changsha, Chengdu, and Hankou as alternate Supervisory Committee members. The Shanghai General Station was elected as the Executive Committee of the National General Association. After receiving the notification, the station immediately printed and distributed election ballots to elect nine executive committee members. As a result, Xie Chunpu, Zhang Jingfu, Feng Zhenyi, Lu Huaiqing, Shen Yide, Zhang Ruihua, Su Zuqing, Gu Ermei, Zeng Yangwu, and others were elected as executive committee members, with Lu Mouliang, Bao Wenfu, and Gu Runmin as alternate executive committee members.</p>
<p>First Meeting: Convened by Xie Chunpu the day before yesterday (the 18th), many important cases were passed, and it was decided to hold an inauguration ceremony on July 15. At that time, each station will be requested to send representatives to Shanghai to participate in order to show solemnity. The association's most important work recently is to cope with the salary increase issue in July. It is heard that the association also intends to strive for the protection of radio station staff across the country in the future. However, the greatest goal, in addition to seeking the welfare of members, is still the mission of developing the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>New Members: More than two-thirds of the national radio stations have established Tongyi Associations. Recently, in addition to the local International Radio Station staff, the Tongyi Association has also been established. In order to achieve unity, the association has sent a letter to join the General Association, which will greatly facilitate the handling of affairs.</p>
<h3>The Experience of Specialists of the Postal Economic Committee</h3>
<p>On the 18th, the Postal Research Association held the first discussion meeting at the Municipal Government. Chairman Wu and other committee members were very cautious about the selection of specialized committee members. At that time, more than ten specialist candidates were recommended by various parties. After careful consideration by the committee members, Li Gan, Wang Wenwei, and Shen Yangyi, who were rich in economic knowledge and postal expertise, were first designated as specialists. It was found that Li Gan was a highly prestigious accountant in Shanghai with extensive knowledge of economics. Wang Wenwei had postal expertise and had worked in the industry and handled postal administrative affairs for more than twenty years. He had deep qualifications in the postal service. In the first year of the Republic of China, he served as the director of the Postal Department and was transferred to the Postal General Administration, where he served as the director of the General Administration. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he returned to serve as the director of the Postal Department. He resigned in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China and entered the banking industry. Shen Yangyi had worked in the postal service for more than ten years and had served as an accountant and cashier in the Shanghai Bureau. When the Savings and Remittance Bureau was established in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he was appointed to handle savings accounting matters. He was very familiar with the accounting situation of the postal service and savings and remittance and had a research in accounting.</p>
<h3>Trade Unions and Others Formed a Federation of Trade Unions</h3>
<p>Central Interpretation Claimed No Legal Basis</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Criticized by Municipal Government Order</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Union, the First District Water and Electricity Workers' Union, the Publishing Industry Union, the Construction Industry Workers' Union, the First District Knitting Industry Union, the Second District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, the Ink Making Industry Union, the Fourth District Silk Industry Union, the Zhabei District Silk Industry Union, the Third District Silk Industry Union, the Tea Making Industry Union, the Fifth District Paper Making Industry Union, the Dockworkers' General Union, the Fourth District Union, the Railway Workers' Union, the Dockworkers' General Union, the Steamboat Wood Industry Union, the Pawnshop Workers' Union, the Customs Broker Workers' Union, the Grain Industry Workers' Union, the First District Rubber Products Industry Union, the Coal Industry Workers' Union, the Yang Cloth Industry Union, the Sixth District Textile Industry Union, the Huajia Ferry Union, and the Bank Workers' Union formed the Federation of Trade Unions in January of this year, setting up an office at No. 51 Dan Road, Zhan River, and applied to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for registration. The bureau considered that such an organization had no legal basis and whether it should be approved was a matter of the Central People's Movement. The bureau immediately submitted a report to the Municipal Government for instructions from the Central Government. Yesterday, after receiving instructions from the Municipal Government, it immediately notified the trade unions. The original order stated that the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang had issued a letter stating that the organization of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions had no legal basis and that the application could not be approved.</p>
<h3>Exemption of Water Fees in the Northeastern District</h3>
<p>Real Estate Association Asks for Two Months' Exemption</p>
<p>Water Company Only Agrees to Handle with Discretion</p>
<p>Areas in the concession that suffered from the war should be exempt from water fees due to the relocation of residents during the war. However, the company did not agree to a uniform two-month exemption in the Northeast districts. After the Real Estate Association sent a letter to negotiate, the company replied that it could only handle it with discretion. The exchange of letters is recorded below:</p>
<p>Reply from the British Shanghai Waterworks Company to the Real Estate Association: In reply to your letter of the 10th of this month regarding the exemption of water fees in the Hongkou area, our company will handle each case according to its circumstances and has already reached an agreement with many. This is a special reply, and we hope you will understand.</p>
<p>Letter from the Real Estate Association to the Water Company: On June 14, you replied that the water fees north of the Suzhou River have been exempted, which shows your company's generosity and willingness to listen to advice, which we greatly admire. While we were preparing to express our gratitude, we received a letter from Sun Hechai, the representative of Jingji Company, stating that since the January 28th Incident, there have been three months of disturbances in Shanghai, and various districts have generally had measures to exempt donations and rents. The East District has exempted both for two months, which has also become a fact. However, the Water Company has not made any statement on the water bill. It is rumored that the North District has been exempted for two months, while the East District has only been exempted for one month, which is unfair. During the war, most of the houses in our area were evacuated, and no one lived in the rooms, so no one used the water. It was not until April that people began to move back, and even now it has not returned to its former state. Why does the Water Company not observe the suffering of the residents and show sympathy, but instead ask the residents to pay for water that they did not use? Our area is a package water system, and the rent has been exempted for two months. From whom will the water fee for these two months be taken? If the Water Company does not forgive, it will have to be taken from the tenants. Directly or indirectly, this is not a fair way. Therefore, we are writing to report to your association and request that you protest to the Water Company and ask for the same method as the patrol donation in each district.</p>

<h3>Establishment of China's First Sound Film Company</h3>
<p>In recent years, imported films have filled the market, and if domestic films are not actively promoted and rectified, it seems that they will all go bankrupt. Recently, the organization of the First Sound Film Co., Ltd. has been established, and preparations are now complete. It has begun operations in the Sassoon Building and has purchased a studio site in West Shanghai. All equipment and photographic equipment have been purchased from the latest inventions in Hollywood, USA. Photographers and other technical personnel have also hired many American experts. The films produced are available in both Mandarin and Cantonese, as well as historical, travel, and educational films.

<h3>Tragic Explosion and Fire at the Municipal Health Testing Institute</h3>
<p>Two Houses Destroyed, One Dead and Two Injured</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>At 11:50 a.m. yesterday, the medicine room on the lower floor of the rear building of the Shanghai Municipal Health Testing Institute at No. 189 Guangdong Street, Jin Hwa Fang, Zhabei, suddenly exploded and caught fire, destroying two houses, killing one person and injuring two. The cause of the accident is unknown. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Location of the Accident: No. 189 Guangdong Street, Shanghai Municipal Health Testing Institute, is a three-bay Western-style building. The middle is a reception room, and the two sides are offices. There is also a three-story Western-style building in the back, which is a health testing laboratory. There is a two-foot square cellar built under it, which is dedicated to storing various medicines. The explosion and fire occurred from this cellar.</p>
<p>Explosion Situation: The institute was occupied by the Japanese army during the Shanghai War. The Qifeng Public School on the left was used as the headquarters of the Japanese army. The institute was only taken over on the 17th and has just moved in. It is currently under renovation. Yesterday morning, electrician Gan Fugui from the Shuntai Electrical Appliance Company on North Sichuan Road was hired to repair the lights in the lower floor of the rear building. At about 11:50 a.m., a loud noise was heard from under the cellar at the bottom of the house. Suddenly, flames burst out and white smoke filled the air. The ceiling was immediately blown through, and the glass skylights in the house and the patio were shattered. The sound was very loud and could be heard from far away. The electrician was injured in the explosion and was rescued outside the door. Wang Jingshen, an accountant at the institute, happened to be passing by the door and was also injured in the explosion, covered in blood and collapsed outside the door, unconscious. Furthermore, Mao Fuhai, a tea servant at the institute, happened to be upstairs. The floor was blown through, and he fell into the fire and was burned to death.</p>
<p>Efforts to Extinguish the Fire: Upon hearing the sound, the staff of the institute reported the alarm to various places. The Zhabei Fire Brigade and the concession fire trucks arrived one after another at 1 p.m. and worked hard to extinguish the fire. At 2 p.m., the fire was extinguished, and the tea servant's body was pulled out from the embers and placed outside the back door, waiting for the court to examine and collect it.</p>
<p>Cause to be Investigated: Although the cause of the explosion and fire at the institute has been investigated by the fire brigade in many ways, it has not yet been determined. It may be that the fire was accidentally caused by the repair of the lights and spread to the etheralcohol stored in the cellar, causing the explosion. Or it may be that a bullet left over from the war caused the explosion. In short, there was a very loud bombing sound before the fire, and the explosive force was great. A large piece of the cement floor at the bottom of the house was blown up, and the floor was also blown down, connecting the upper and lower floors. The institute is scheduled to ask experts to conduct a detailed inspection today to determine whether it was a landmine explosion or whether there were other reasons.</p>
<p>One Dead and Two Injured: After the incident, it was investigated that Mao Fuhai, the tea servant of the institute, was 32 years old and from Changzhou. He was killed on the spot. The upper limbs were blown away, and only the thighs and calves of the lower limbs remained. His body was covered in blackness, his abdomen was broken, his intestines were out, and his face had also been blown away, leaving a black skeleton. The death was extremely tragic. Wang Jingshen, the accountant, was 33 years old and from Xiren. His face was seriously injured. Gan Fugui, the craftsman, was 16 years old and slightly injured on his upper body. Both were treated at Renji Hospital. According to the doctors at the hospital, although the injuries of the two were serious, there was no danger to their lives.</p>
<p>Aftermath: After the accident, the director of the Health Testing Institute telegraphed the family of the deceased in Changzhou. At 5 p.m., Yang, a prosecutor from the Shanghai Local Court, arrived at the scene of the accident to examine and collect the body. Wang Jingshen, the injured accountant, was treated in ward No. 284 of Renji Hospital, and Ms. Sun Mingqi, a doctor from the Testing Institute, accompanied him in the hospital.</p>
<p>Fifth District Report: When the reporter inquired at the Second Sub-station of the Fifth District, it was said that at 11:50 a.m., police officer Zhu Dianrui of post No. 29 heard the explosion and went to the scene of the accident to investigate. He then returned to the station to report. The director, Niu Jingfa, and inspector Cheng Yunkun went to inspect it for a week and reported it to the Public Security Bureau. The losses of the Health Testing Institute have not yet been detailed. The loss of pharmaceuticals is estimated to be more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Decline of Inland River Ships to Move to Hunan to Open New Routes</h3>
<p>Most Affected by the War</p>
<p>Highway Completion Leads to Business Decline</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Seeks New Outlets</p>
<p>Plans to Designate Routes in Hunan</p>
<p>After the opening of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the business of inland river ships plummeted. In addition, with the completion of highways in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is even more difficult for small steamships to survive. Therefore, inland river ships in Shanghai are considering moving to Hunan to open new routes. The information we have investigated is detailed below:</p>
<p>Unable to Resume Service After the War: Inland river ships were suspended for more than two months due to the floods in Jiangsu last year. This spring, they were attacked by Japanese pirates in Shanghai. Although the Shanghai-Suzhou line had a period of excellent passenger operations, all other routes were completely suspended, outweighing gains from losses. After the opening of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, inland river ships could normally return to their original state. However, the shipping lines in various parts of Suzhou were affected by military transport and the aftermath of the war, and they could not resume service. The small ships of the various shipping companies were mostly idle.</p>
<p>Highways Completed One After Another: The highways built in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been completed one after another. The route from Jiangyin to Wuxi, which used to rely entirely on small ships for transportation, now has the Chengxi Highway open to traffic. The fare is low and the time is fast, and people have abandoned boats for land. As a result, the shipping companies' Wuxi-Chengdu ships had to suspend service. The route from Suzhou to Changzhou also relies on small ships for transportation. Now this highway has been built by the 19th Route Army in a week and can be opened to traffic in September. At that time, the small ships will also have to withdraw. Other places with navigation have built highways, and inland river ships will be completely eliminated by the times.</p>
<p>No Passengers or Cargo on Major Routes: Among the inland river shipping companies in Shanghai, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the largest, with 26 routes. The rest are Yuantong, Qingji, Lixing, and other companies. The main routes of each company are Shanghai-Suzhou, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Huzhou, and Shanghai-Wuxi. After the war, there were almost no passengers on each of these routes. Cargo transportation was affected by the market, and there was no cargo in the accounts at the end of May. Each trip, no matter the route, was not enough to pay for the coal.</p>
<p>Hunan Prohibits Foreign Ships: The Japanese Daishin Chang company in Shanghai has been sold to Chinese operators. In Hunan, however, it is still operated by the Japanese. The Hunan Provincial Party Department investigated and verified this matter and requested the Hunan Provincial Government to order a prohibition. The right of Daishin Chang to operate in Hunan has been revoked, and its wharves, warehouses, and ships have been completely purchased, and Japanese ships are no longer allowed to operate in the inland areas of Hunan. This case has been fundamentally resolved.</p>
<p>Shanghai Ships Moved to Hunan to Open Routes: The impact of the highways in Jiangsu and Zhejiang on the inland China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has made it impossible to maintain the entire shipping industry. The company has been discussing new plans and new routes for several days. After consultation, it was decided that the best way out was to move the small ships from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Hunan. Because central Hunan is full of waterways, and now is the best opportunity when Japanese ships are suspended. The company has decided to send several special commissioners to Hunan to plan new routes and to contact the Hunan provincial authorities to handle the transfer of shipping and other procedures.</p>
<h3>Foul Odor Permeates the Wusong Railway Factory</h3>
<p>Surveyor Succumbs to the Pollution and Dies</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Wusong Railway Factory in Songnan, Zhanghuabang, was used by the Japanese army as a headquarters. Therefore, the army came and went, and the factory was the base of operations. With so many people, management was difficult, resulting in filth, urination, and defecation throughout the factory. There were even dead bodies and rotten livestock. The stench was abnormal. Since the Japanese army withdrew on the 2nd of this month, the railway bureau suffered heavy losses due to the damage and shortage of machinery. Therefore, Wang Caijin (from Ningbo, over 40 years old), the foreman of the copper shop, was ordered to inspect the factory. When Wang entered the factory, he was shocked by the foul odor and immediately fainted. He was unconscious and was taken home. That night, before dawn, he died of the filth. It is said that Wang was strong and energetic, and he was quite capable, so he was trusted by his superiors. It is a pity that he died of filth. The materials department, the mechanical affairs department, and other departments in the railway bureau are busy organizing and entering the factory due to the loss of documents, drawings, registers, case drafts, etc. that were previously stored in the factory. Sanitation is of great importance. Moreover, the weather is going to be hot and summer, and the spread of epidemics must be prevented. Now the railway bureau has sent personnel to disinfect and wash the foul odor in various parts of the factory. At the same time, 1,000 masks were rushed to be made and distributed to the staff, officers, and artisans working in the factory to emphasize hygiene and avoid epidemics.</p>
<h3>Negligence on a Cargo Ship on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The amount of damage is still being investigated.</p>
<p>Part of the cargo was damaged by water.</p>
<p>The cargo ship "Slrooskerk" of the Dutch shipping company Java Lijn, arrived in Shanghai from Rotterdam, Netherlands, via Hamburg, Germany, and was docked at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf. Yesterday morning, a sudden fire caused considerable damage. The results of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Unloading Cargo: The "Slrooskerk," a cargo ship of the East Asia line of the Dutch Shipping Company managed by Java Lijn, arrived in Shanghai with a large quantity of cargo from ports such as Rotterdam and Amsterdam. It entered the port on the morning of the 19th. The ship was docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf (commonly known as the "Deaf Man's Wharf") of the British-owned Old Taikoo Company in Pootung and began unloading cargo. The imported goods destined for Shanghai included hardware, paper, dyes, and general merchandise, all of which were stored in the wharf's warehouses. Yesterday morning, while work was underway to open the holds, a sudden report of negligence was made, and the fire spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Negligence: The ship was also bound for the Orient, and when leaving the Netherlands, the cargo was divided and stacked in the holds. Cargo bound for Japan was mostly in the aft holds. One of the cargo holds contained a batch of saltpeter, which is most prone to causing accidents. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, as the hold was being opened to unload cargo, the saltpeter inside suddenly caught fire and emitted smoke. In an instant, flames shot upwards and spread rapidly. Although the cause of the fire has not been determined, it can be inferred that the fire was caused by embers left in the saltpeter.</p>
<p>Rescue: When the shipowner, Mr. Lynch, learned of the fire, he immediately ordered all crew members and sailors to quickly retrieve the ship's specially prepared firefighting equipment and spray water to extinguish the flames. However, the fire was too fierce and the efforts were ineffective. The shipowner then telegraphed the Shanghai shipping company, and the Customs Office also received the news, immediately ordering a fireboat to rush to the Blue Funnel Wharf to assist in the rescue. While helping to spray water, the shipowner ordered the undamaged cargo holds to be sealed off and isolated to protect the un-discharged cargo.</p>
<p>Losses: The fire continued to burn until the afternoon, with lingering smoke. The total amount of cargo that had been burned has not yet been determined and will only be clear after a thorough investigation. The head of the Shanghai shipping company has ordered the shipowner to report. Some of the cargo that was not burned was also damaged by water. These goods will all need to be subject to a water damage assessment and will be unloaded onto the wharf after the fire is extinguished and inspected by a surveyor before a determination can be made. It is currently impossible to estimate the amount of the loss. The burned areas of the deck, etc., were severely damaged and need to be repaired. The ship was originally scheduled to sail to the Orient and North China today, and return to Shanghai on July 9 to transport cargo back to the Netherlands and other ports.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Guns and Ammunition Seized</h3>
<p>Captain Liang of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Huangpu River Patrol Team, based on a tip, reported that the French mail ship "Xia Daoshi" (transliteration), which entered the port on the 3rd of this month, had people on board trafficking a large number of handguns and bullets to Shanghai for sale. He immediately ordered detectives to disguise themselves as buyers and meet with Fang and Xia, the ringleaders, on the ship to purchase the goods. They agreed to buy a total of 26 guns, first taking six handguns and more than 2,000 bullets, for a total of 330 yuan. They also agreed to take the money and then take 20 more guns. The detectives returned to the team to report, confirming that there were a large number of handguns. Therefore, Captain Liang led police detectives to search the ship. Because it was late at night, the gun dealers, having learned of the plan, had already taken out more than 300 handguns from their hiding place on the ship, along with the bullets, and hired a barge, which was towed by a small boat. The detectives spotted this, shouted for them to stop, but the small boat ignored them, so they immediately opened fire to stop them. The small boat, knowing it was difficult to escape, released the towrope and fled. At that time, the Garrison Headquarters also received a message and sent personnel to investigate, but the barge with all the guns was captured by the river patrol, and five crew members were detained. They were immediately presented to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation. After interrogation by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, one of the five people arrested knew the residence of Fang and Xia, so detectives were sent to arrest them, but they had already fled. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has now presented the seized handguns and bullets, a total of four sacks, to the Garrison Headquarters. At the same time, the arrested criminals were transferred to the court for interrogation. However, the river patrol claimed that only 26 handguns and more than 2,000 bullets were seized at the time, and five people were detained.</p>
<h3>Separate Report on the Pawnshop Bloodshed Case</h3>
<p>The young master and his friend are on the run.</p>
<p>The two shop employees died so tragically.</p>
<p>Weng Xiongjun, a Chaozhou native, runs two pawnshops in Shanghai, one at 517 Xinzha Road, named Juxing, and the other at 2649 Yangshupu Road, named Qingfu. Both have been in business for many years. There are a total of four employees at Qingfu Pawnshop: the manager Xu Akun, the counter employee Li Guannan, the senior apprentice Jiang Zhenfang, and the junior apprentice Zhang Xianglong. Xu is Weng's brother-in-law, Li is from Luodian, 29 years old, and has worked in the shop for six or seven years. Jiang is from the same hometown as Weng, only 23 years old, and just joined the shop last year. Weng Xiongjun has a son named Yuanzhen, who is 22 years old. He does not engage in proper work, associates with bandits, and is particularly good at squandering money. Although he has been reprimanded many times, he has never repented. During this Sino-Japanese war, Yangshupu became a war zone, and Qingfu temporarily suspended business. Weng sent his son back to his hometown to avoid him wandering around Shanghai and causing trouble. Recently, with the war having stopped and business recovering, Weng Yuanzhen returned to Shanghai from Chaozhou last Friday (the 17th), accompanied by a friend, Mr. Jia. They stayed and ate at Qingfu Pawnshop. The employees of the shop treated them very warmly because Mr. Jia was a close friend of the young master. The next day (the 18th) at 9:00 AM, the manager Xu Akun went out on business, and Yuanzhen also went out with Mr. Jia. They did not return until 1:00 PM. Xu had not yet returned to the shop. Yuanzhen ordered the apprentice Zhang Xianglong to go to Deyuan Lane nearby to find someone surnamed Zhou. After a long time, he returned to the shop and suddenly saw that the front door was tightly closed. He knocked but no one opened it. He went to the back door, but both doors were also closed. He knocked again and again, and the door finally opened. Yuanzhen beckoned him to come inside, but Zhang suddenly saw bloodstains on his hands and hesitated to enter. Yuanzhen saw Zhang hesitating and still beckoned him repeatedly. Zhang went to Juxing to report, but because he did not know the way, he rushed to Yinxiang Port to find Weng Xiongjun's friend, Mr. Yao, to guide him. However, not long after Zhang left, Yuanzhen and his friend, Mr. Jia, left the shop and went their own way. Soon, a peddler named Renshan passed by the back door of the pawnshop and found it strange that the door was wide open and there was no sound inside. He entered the house to take a look and unexpectedly saw two male corpses lying on the floor of the shop, with bloodstains everywhere. Without taking a closer look, he ran out to report to the No. 15 Japanese police, who reported to the Yangshupu police station. Detective Ma Zonglai and a Western detective rushed to the pawnshop. At that time, the shop owner Weng Xiongjun and the manager Xu Akun had all returned to the shop. They confirmed that the deceased were Li Guannan and Jiang Zhenfang. They observed that their heads, chests, and backs had been injured by knives and axes. The murder weapons were still left beside the corpses. They examined the shop's property and found that about 1,000 yuan worth of jewelry and cash was missing. In addition, they found clothes and shoes worn by Yuanzhen that were stained with blood. It was clear that Li and Jiang had been murdered by Yuanzhen and Mr. Jia after they tricked the apprentice Zhang Xianglong into leaving the shop. Chinese and Western detectives immediately took the corpses to the Fei Lun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Li to come to the morgue to confirm the cause of death. He ordered that Li's corpse be handed over to his adoptive father, Zhang Shiqin, and Jiang's corpse be handed over to his cousin, Fang Peiqing, for separate burials, pending the arrest of the murderer and punishment.</p>
<h3>Spouses Cannot File Private Suits for Bigamy</h3>
<p>Han Yueling's lawsuit against her husband was rejected.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council should provide relief.</p>
<p>Guo Luman, the son of wealthy businessman Guo Yonglan, abandoned his legal wife, Han Yueling, and married Xu Yaqing. After the marriage, Han learned of it and hired a lawyer to file a private criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court, requesting that her husband be punished for bigamy, that the new bride Yaqing be punished for accessory to marriage, and that Xu Shuguan, and matchmakers Xing Chunhua and Lian Jiming also be held responsible for assisting the principal offender in committing the crime. The original complaint has been published in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the scheduled date for the hearing of the case. The plaintiff, Han Yueling, brought her second daughter, Peiyu, and her youngest daughter, Peifu, and her lawyer to the court on time. Only Guo Luman and Xing Chunhua, two of the defendants, arrived. Xu Yaqing claimed to be ill and did not attend, and appointed lawyer Chen Tingrui to represent her. However, Xu's sister went to the court alone and sat in the press section of the court to listen. In addition, many men and women attended the hearing. After Judge Wu Tingqi took the bench, Wu Chengyu, the lawyer for the defendant Guo Luman, presented Article 339 of the Criminal Code, stating that the article stipulates that spouses may not file private suits. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawsuit in this case was illegal and should not be accepted. Judge Wu first questioned Guo and Han, and they testified that they had formally married Guo Luman in the Republic of China year. The defendant Guo Luman testified that his marriage to Han was according to his parents' orders. Judge Wu then declared that according to the current Criminal Code, spouses may not file private suits for bigamy. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawyer, Zhang Jiahui, rose to state that the situation in the concession was special and that the powers of the prosecutor were restricted. Therefore, relief should be sought in such cases. Guo's lawyer then stated that Guo had divorced Han in the past and no longer recognized her as his wife. Now, because he was being sued by her, he had filed a suit in the civil court to determine his marital status. Finally, Xu Yaqing's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, said that the plaintiff accused Xu of being an accessory to marriage, but in fact, Xu was also tricked into marriage. Now Xu intends to file a suit against all related parties for tricking her into marriage. Judge Wu then announced in court that Han's lawsuit against Guo Luman was rejected and that she should request the Municipal Council to handle the case. The remaining defendants will be interrogated again.</p>
<h3>Chaplin's Brother Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arrived yesterday aboard the Japanese ship Terukuni Maru.</p>
<p>Toured the city for a week and the ship continued to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The world-famous movie comedian Charlie Chaplin, accompanied by his brother Sydney Chaplin, traveled to Japan and was warmly welcomed along the way. Charlie Chaplin went directly from Japan to the United States to return to Hollywood to work. His brother Sydney Chaplin took the Terukuni Maru from Japan to Europe to tour. The Terukuni Maru arrived at the Huishan Wharf at 7:00 AM yesterday. People from all walks of life thought that Charlie Chaplin had come to Shanghai and went to welcome him. After boarding the ship, they learned that it was Sydney Chaplin. Sydney is also a film comedian, but not as great as his younger brother. Sydney disembarked yesterday and toured the city for a week. He will take the original ship to Hong Kong this morning at 10:00 AM and then go to Europe.</p>
<h3>Public Concession's Health Work in May</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Health Officer reported in May that May is the most healthy month in Shanghai. The death rate for foreigners this month was 0.10 (12.3 in April), and for Chinese it was 13.60 (20.30 in April).</p>
<p>Cholera this year was first seen in neighboring areas in April, and in the concession on May 2. It was rarely this early since 1902. Cholera does not exist in Shanghai in winter, but it was already present in central China in April, so it seems that the disease was brought in from other ports. It was also mentioned in the annual report at the end of last year that, based on past predictions, this year would be a year of severe cholera. The reported number of patients this month was one foreigner and twenty-four Chinese. After further investigation, there were a total of fifty-two people, including those who were not reported. It is not easy to predict how severe this year will be, but in 1902, 160 people died from it, at which time the population was 350,000. Now the population is eight times that of that year, but the number of patients and deaths is far less, which shows that the prevention has been effective. A total of 27,855 people were vaccinated this month, mostly workers.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, the average annual death rate in the Public Concession per 10,000 people was 11.7 for tuberculosis, 1.35 for smallpox, 1.55 for scarlet fever, and 1.2 for cholera. In Calcutta, India, the most recent cholera death rate in the past twenty years was 7 per 10,000. However, prevention work must continue to improve, and progress in finance, engineering, and the distribution of health education are all prerequisites. Smallpox was even lower in May. Scarlet fever reached its highest number in April, and then declined daily. Intermittent fever has increased among Chinese people. One more case of schistosomiasis has occurred.</p>
<p>The pathology laboratory received 1,218 samples this month, the highest number ever, mostly due to the outbreak of cholera. The production of cholera vaccine also reached 60 liters. The examination of milk for tuberculosis bacteria is also in progress.</p>
<p>The number of patients admitted to the isolation hospital in the hospital has decreased. The neuropsychiatric hospital refused to admit patients in four cases due to insufficient equipment. The lung sanatorium on Hongqiao Road is not yet fully utilized.</p>
<p>All but two of the licensed milk factories in the northern district have resumed operations. 125 milk samples were inspected, of which 14 had poor ingredients, but only one was adulterated with water. The number of slaughtered animals in the Municipal Council's slaughterhouse has almost returned to normal. The number of pigs slaughtered has even exceeded the number of pigs slaughtered last year, and the meat quality has also improved. More than eight tons of inferior meat discarded by the slaughterhouse. The number of stalls in each small vegetable market is almost normal, except for those on Aierjin Road and Pingliang Road. The stalls in the new vegetable market on Liaoyang Road are all occupied. The vegetable market on Fuzhou Road and Ma Huo Road has been slightly reformed. Weights and measures have been checked, and two inaccurate ones have been found, and their users have been prosecuted. Night inspections of bakeries have been resumed. Because summer is approaching, more attention has been paid to monitoring food stores.</p>
<p>The mosquito reduction campaign was slightly slower during the martial law period, but it has now been intensified. Several ditches have been cleaned, the banks have been cleaned up, and fuel oil has been added. The fish farm in Zhaofeng Park has also been strengthened. Mosquito reduction fish species have been put into several ponds. The fly reduction work is also in progress. Part of the work in Zhabei is still being carried out by the Public Works Department, and the Health Department's cleaning team is also assisting.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Food Commission</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Food Commission held its 34th standing committee meeting at the Social Bureau on June 18th at 2:00 PM. Eleven people attended, including Zhang Binghui, Sun Yongyi, Yu Zixiang, and Yan Xiaoquan. Zhang Binghui chaired the meeting, and Zhou Minggang recorded the minutes. First, the chairman reported on the investigation of grain arrival and sales, as well as the quantity of foreign rice and export registration. Then, Commissioner Yan reported on the stock of foreign rice in the city and the grain market. Then the meeting discussed the meeting affairs. (1) It was requested that the Social Bureau forward a letter to the Finance Bureau, requesting that the grain accumulation funds of Shangbao be divided and kept separately, so as to proceed with the construction of the rice warehouse. (2) It was requested that the Social Bureau submit a report to the Municipal Government, reporting on the daily decline in rice prices and the losses of foreign rice determined by the Warehouse Committee, and asking for instructions on how to deal with the situation. At the same time, the Social Bureau should consider the arrival of rice and advise rice merchants to temporarily suspend the purchase of foreign rice. (3) It was requested that the Social Bureau postpone the implementation of the new municipal grain measure system. This case was proposed by Commissioners Yan Xiaoquan and Zhu Zixiang, who explained on the spot that the Shanghai grain measure has always used the Shanghai measure, which is approximately equal to 1 dou and 9 sheng of the municipal measure. At this time of year when the supply of old rice is running low and new rice has not yet come in, and rice prices are rising, if the new system is suddenly changed, it may cause misunderstandings among the people and create disputes. Moreover, the measure is reduced, but the labor, carrying, and water freight costs are not reduced proportionally. This invisibly increases the burden on food consumers. The state promulgated the new weights and measures system in the hope of unifying the country and facilitating the people. Merchants and people in this city, at this time of war,</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The vitality of business has not recovered. If the implementation of the new system affects people's livelihood and causes difficulties, it will defeat the government's original intention of promulgating the new system. Therefore, it is appropriate to postpone the implementation temporarily and change to the new measure at the end of the year, which is more appropriate.</p>
<h3>Second Weekly Cholera Report from the Seaport Quarantine Station</h3>
<p>The number of patients increased to more than 200 last week.</p>
<p>The Seaport Quarantine Station issued the second weekly cholera report yesterday, as follows: 1. The number of cholera patients in Shanghai increased sharply to 240 last week (ending June 18th) (including 8 deaths). Therefore, the total number of patients this year is 520 to date, and the number of deaths is 30. 2. The number of cholera patients last week is shown on the left.</p>
<p>(1) District Patient Count Death Count</p>
<p>Shanghai City 159 7</p>
<p>Public Concession 65 0</p>
<p>French Concession 16 1</p>
<p>Total 240 8</p>
<p>Total last week 280 22</p>
<p>Total this year 520 30</p>
<p>(2) Hospital Names Patient Count Death Count</p>
<p>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital 191 4</p>
<p>Emergency Epidemic Hospital 124 3</p>
<p>Municipal Council Isolation Hospital 15 1</p>
<p>Public Shanghai Hospital 3 0</p>
<p>Tangshan Road Hongkou Epidemic Hospital 3 0</p>
<p>Red Cross Second Epidemic Hospital 2 0</p>
<p>Xinmin Road Red Cross Epidemic Hospital 2 0</p>
<p>Total 240 8</p>
<p>(3) From the beginning to the present, the cholera mortality rate this year has been very low, only 5.7%. Therefore, although the cholera epidemic situation this year is serious and the epidemic area is wide, it may not be easy to approach and die one after another. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (A) The vaccination work has been strongly promoted. (B) The hospital equipment is complete, and the patients are admitted very early, and the treatment methods are also perfect. (2) The virulence of the cholera vibrio has been reduced. However, the health authorities are paying more attention to preventing the intrusion of cholera and its disinfection. (4) According to Nanjing reports, the cholera situation is also very rampant. In the Central Hospital alone, 80 people have sought treatment. Therefore, to date, there are 200 cholera patients. As for the number of cholera patients in Hankou, Tanggu, and Tianjin, the numbers have also increased slightly compared to the previous period. According to the report from the Hankou Quarantine Station, since June 6, more than 10,000 people have been vaccinated against cholera. (5) Cholera has been found in various parts of Japan, and the authorities in that country are searching for suspected patients among the troops withdrawn from China. However, it cannot be assumed that cholera has occurred in that country because of this. However, it is their own fault and no one else is to blame, and those who use raw water in that country are truly at fault. (6) Regarding the occurrence of cholera, those with running water cannot be blamed for it. Because the running water plants in Shanghai must be filtered and disinfected before supplying users, and the source of the disease is caused by the water of rivers, wells, and ponds. The cholera vibrio is extremely weak, so it grows very quickly in ponds. Bacteria can be swallowed and destroyed, and the cholera is caused by shallow ponds, which people often use to clean latrines. According to those rivers, wells, and ponds, they should be disinfected with over-oxidized manganese or bleaching powder in advance, and the cholera outbreak can also be slightly reduced, and public toilets should also be improved. At this time of early summer, flies are the medium of common diseases, and it is more appropriate to rise up and eliminate them. I deeply hope that all sectors will donate so that poor citizens who cannot use clean drinks can also enjoy the pleasure of running water, eliminate disease and prolong life, and have immeasurable effects.</p>
<h3>Fire at the Pingan Moving Company Burns Two Young Workers to Death</h3>
<p>The corpses were burned to a crisp.</p>
<p>The company did not have fire insurance.</p>
<p>Gu Runxiang, a Suzhou native who opened the Pingan Moving Company at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Cardinal Fesch in the French Concession, had a fire late at night the night before. A young worker was smoking a cigarette in the garage and accidentally dropped it on the gasoline, which immediately exploded and spread the fire. The fire was fierce, and the people sleeping on the second and third floors and in the garage were awakened and escaped. However, two young workers from Suzhou, Sun Caisheng (30 years old) and Sun Fusheng (25 years old), who were sleeping in the loft, could not escape and died in the fire. The fire brigade rushed to extinguish the fire. Three moving trucks were burned. Fortunately, the buildings were strong and did not burn through. Afterwards, the police sent detectives to take the company owner Gu Runxiang to the police station to investigate the cause of the fire. At the same time, firefighters pulled out the two corpses, which were charred beyond recognition, like dried charcoal, a tragic sight. The corpses were taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the police reported to the Second Special Court, and Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke came to the morgue and determined that Sun Caisheng and Sun Fusheng had died from being burned alive. Because the family members were not in Shanghai, the official ordered the corpses to be collected by the church, pending identification by the family.</p>
<p>It is said that the moving company did not have fire insurance. This disaster has exhausted the owner's life's work. It is truly a catastrophe.</p>
<h3>Robbery at the Rue Kadochan Post Office</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, more than a dozen bandits, each carrying weapons, broke into the Rue Kadochan Post Office on Xinzha Road. They immediately searched the office, which was being guarded by staff, and robbed about 800 yuan in large and small silver coins before fleeing with a whistle. Afterwards, the post office reported to the Xinzha police station, which immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene to hunt down the bandits. However, the bandits had already fled far away. They then inquired in detail about the bandits' appearance and accent before reporting back to the police chief, who ordered all police stations to investigate and arrest them.</p>
<h3>Private Arms Trafficking Ring Broken Up on Dent's Road</h3>
<p>The criminals were sentenced separately.</p>
<p>Bao Shuji, the Chinese detective of the Hongkou police station, and Western detective Anting, cracked a private arms trafficking ring at No. 40 Chunzi Lane, Dent's Road, at 10:30 PM on the 7th of this month. They arrested Luo Wangshi, a Shandong woman, Xu Zicheng, a Sichuan native, and Zeng Jinyuan, Lai Tianfu, Qu Zezhe, and He Fuan, four suspects of trafficking opium and suspicion. They seized three Mauser handguns and 496 bullets and brought them back to the police station together. They sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The case has now concluded and the sentence has been pronounced. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong came to the First Court and sentenced Luo Wangshi to a fine of 300 yuan for possessing military firearms and ammunition. If the fine is not paid after forced execution, it will be converted into imprisonment at a rate of two yuan per day. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined will be used to offset the fine at a rate of two yuan per day. Xu Zicheng was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 500 yuan for transporting opium. He was sentenced to a fine of 300 yuan for attempting to buy military firearms and ammunition. The sentence to be executed is six months in prison and a fine of 600 yuan. The number of days of detention will be allowed to offset the sentence. The guns and ammunition will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Qu Axiu was Killed by Injuries</h3>
<p>Three ribs on the right side were broken.</p>
<p>Qu Axiu, a relative of Tang Xianglin, a tailor in Jicheng Lane No. 1, Wandai Bridge, West Gate, gambled on mahjong on the 16th of this month. At midnight, he went out to urinate and was grabbed by Fan Chongyan, the owner of the Da Zhonghua Restaurant, who punched and kicked him in the chest. After the beating, he wanted to send him to the police station, but he was persuaded to leave. The next day, Qu suddenly felt unwell. Tang thought it was an epidemic and scraped the skin for him, causing his whole body to turn red. On the morning of the 18th, Qu said that he was injured, but it was too late to save him and he died. Tang immediately took Fan into custody at the police station and sent him to the local court for detention. Prosecutor Yang An and others came to the scene. Because the deceased's body was covered with traces of scraping, they could not examine his injuries. Yesterday, Tang's wife arrived in Shanghai and immediately applied to the court for a second examination. With the judge's approval, the body was dissected in the forensic laboratory. It was found that the deceased's right ribs were broken in three places and his lungs were also injured. It was confirmed that he died from the injuries. He ordered the family to collect the body. He then took the defendant to the morgue to identify him and ordered him to be detained for punishment.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Two Red Cross Epidemic Hospitals</h3>
<p>The First (Xin Suo Road, Zhabei) and Second (Mei Baige Road, Zhangjia浜) Epidemic Hospitals, run by the Chinese Red Cross, opened yesterday afternoon. Wang Xiaolai, president of the First Hospital, and Lin Kanghou, president of the Second Hospital, delivered speeches one after another. Wen Lanting then thanked them and led them to visit the wards. The meeting was adjourned after a photo was taken.</p>
<h3>Xu Zemin Completes the Reunion of a Family</h3>
<p>A man surnamed Xie, with several children, previously worked at the Commercial Press in Zhabei. When the war broke out, he sought refuge in the South City. After losing his job, his family of several struggled to make ends meet. Recently, due to unsuccessful job seeking, he had pawned everything he owned. Left with no choice, he discussed with his wife the idea of selling their own children through an intermediary. On the 18th, at 8 PM, Xie and his wife were carrying their four-year-old and two-year-old sons, intending to go to the place where they would sell them. On their way through the French Concession, the husband and wife were supporting each other, weeping bitterly. Passersby, not understanding the reason, began to gather. A young man named Xu Zemin passed by and inquired about the situation. Xie then recounted the whole story. Those who heard it sighed deeply. Xu then told them not to cry and said, "I will help you find a solution." He instructed Xie to return home, and Xu accompanied them. Upon arriving at their residence, he gathered the neighbors and announced everything that Xie had been through. Xu then took out all the silver dollars from his wallet, amounting to several yuan, and gave them all away. He then urged the crowd to donate. Many onlookers, seeing Xu's generosity, felt a surge of benevolence. In a short time, they collected no less than fifty or sixty silver dollars and copper coins. Xu thanked the crowd and handed the money to Xie, urging him to start a small business temporarily and seek a new position slowly. When Xie asked for his address, Xu had already left. Xu Zemin's completion of the family reunion and helping those in urgent need is truly admirable.</p>

<h3>Wu Xiahu Urges Fellow Townsmen to Promote National Goods</h3>
<p>Wu Xiahu from Ganpu has been tirelessly promoting national goods in recent years. Recently, he learned that fellow townsmen from Ganpu in Shanghai who deal in foreign cloth are about to resume their activities. He then persuaded them to promote national goods, emphasizing the idea that every citizen has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. It is said that the fellow townsmen mostly agreed. Also, last spring, Wu and Zhu Qingyuan, among others, organized the Ganpu Fellow Townsmen Association and went to Hangzhou to start a newspaper, all managed by Zhu. After the Shanghai war, the association's affairs were suspended, which is regrettable. It is now learned that they have decided to invite Zhu and others to revitalize the association, striving to live up to the earnest expectations of their fellow townsmen.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I read the news item published in the "News" section of your newspaper on June 20, titled "Illegal Organization Established Under the Guise of Postal Workers Shut Down." It stated that our office was instigated by Xing Rongzhao and others, who were lured by a certain party, to employ and impersonate members of the various sub-branches' special teams to organize a joint office without authorization. When it was closed down, the main figures, such as Xing Rongzhao, Tu Heyun, and Sun Hanliang, and more than ten others, fled. And the commander Tang, who was specially dispatched by a certain party authority, left Shanghai after the incident. This is not in accordance with the facts. Our office was formed by the combination of the 32nd, 29th, 12th, 20th, and 5th sub-branches, and the 9th, 27th, 6th, 10th, 5th, 17th, 21st, 26th, and 11th special teams. It was because we did not want to be oppressed by the labor traitors Lu Jingshi and Zhu Xuefan for a long time and sought to liberate ourselves, and organized separately. Moreover, among the eleven members of the executive committee, there are no such persons as Xing Rongzhao, Sun Hanliang, and Tu Heyun. As for being lured by a certain party, it is even more absurd. The reason for the closure was that the labor traitor Lu Jingshi, relying on the power of the Party Committee, deceived the Party Headquarters and sent a document to the municipal government, which was transferred to the Public Security Bureau. At that time, our office immediately sent executive committee members Sun Zhudong and Yu Chengcai to directly negotiate with the First Branch of the Fourth District. How could there be any escape? In short, our office is fighting for the liberation of three thousand postal workers, and we are not afraid of any difficulties or dangers. In addition to sending representatives to Beijing to petition, we ask your newspaper to uphold justice and make corrections on our behalf. Sincerely, The Temporary Joint Office of the Various Sub-Branches Special Teams of the Shanghai Postal Workers Union, June 20.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have read a news item in the local news column of your newspaper on the 20th of this month, titled "Tong Taiyong Sues Insurance Company for Compensation After Being Bombed." It stated that "Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the company was bombed by the Japanese army on February 2nd." This is not in accordance with the facts. The Tong Taiyong Company is located at 3263 to 3266 Seward Road, which is in the central area of the Public Settlement and is definitely not a war zone. Moreover, when the fire broke out at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning on February 2nd, it was proven by all parties that no shells or bombs had landed there. Therefore, the burning of the company is absolutely unrelated to the war. I am writing to request your newspaper to promptly make a correction to clarify the truth. I am deeply grateful. Sincerely, Lawyer Lin Yingqing, June 20, Republic of China 21.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Orders Secondary Schools and Above to Postpone Enrollment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to municipal and private registered secondary schools and above, stating: "According to Instruction No. 4277 from the Ministry of Education, which states, 'According to the telegram from the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education, Instruction No. 3706 has been issued, ordering all schools to comply,' it is clear that your ministry is providing convenience for young people to pursue higher education with utmost care. Considering the old custom of enrollment in public and private commercial secondary schools is also in early July, junior high school graduates also feel the same inconvenience. I propose that your ministry consider and approve a general order to all public and private senior high schools across the country, so that they, like colleges and universities, appropriately postpone the enrollment examination period, so as to avoid the difficulty of junior high schools requiring early graduation. I earnestly hope for this." In addition to replying by telegram and issuing separate orders, the facts have been reported. It is now ordered that the enrollment date of all schools be postponed to facilitate further education."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province 8th District Local Education Research Association Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussing Primary School Work Course Teaching Methods and Moral Education Issues</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Province 8th District Local Education Research Association held its second research meeting on the 19th at the Shanghai Provincial High School High School Department Library outside Xiaonanmen, Lujiabang in this city. The meeting is summarized below.</p>
<p>Attendees: Shen Jing and Zheng Shaoyuan from the Shanghai County Education Bureau, Xiang Weixian from the Jinshan County Education Bureau, Yang Baying from the Baoshan County Education Bureau, Sheng Langxi, Cheng Xuqing, and Zhang Yongchun from the Shanghai High School Experimental Primary School, Xi Yangzhi from the Shanghai High School Rural Normal Department, Zong Hanliang and Huang Shiping from the Shanghai High School Rural Experimental Primary School, Shen Yizhen and Lu Shaoji from the Shanghai High School Normal Department, instructor Hu Chaolun, and Shanghai High School Principal Zheng Xigu, etc.</p>
<p>Lu Shaoji's Report: The meeting began at 10 AM, chaired by Lu Shaoji and recorded by Yang Baying. After the usual formalities, the chairman reported on two aspects: the purpose of the meeting and its tasks. (A) Regarding the purpose, this conference is based on the resolutions of the previous conference to discuss "Primary School Work Course Teaching Methods" and "Moral Education Issues." I believe these two issues are very important in today's Chinese education. The main goal of the work course teaching method is to cultivate students' manual skills and increase their interest in production. The discussion of moral education issues focuses on how to guide students to become good citizens of modern society. In terms of new education, what the West calls "new education" now is to be socialized, scientificized, and productivized. If we can solve these two problems satisfactorily now, we can be said to be adapting to the new education and avoid the shortcomings of "educational formalism." Furthermore, in terms of the Three Principles of the People education, the first issue is related to the education of nationalism and the education of people's livelihood, and the second issue is related to the education of democracy. If we can solve these two problems now and implement them, we can be said to be implementing the Three Principles of the People education. Because I feel the importance of these two issues, I represent this association to (1) hope that all attendees will express their opinions on these two issues as much as possible, so that there will be good conclusions, and (2) hope that all attendees will work hard to implement the resolutions after the meeting, so that there will be practical benefits for local education in this district. (B) Regarding the association's affairs, the previous conference resolved that "a work course achievement exhibition should be held during this conference." However, due to the national crisis and economic difficulties, it will not be held this year. Whether it should be held next year will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Zheng Xigu's Speech: After the chairman's report, Shanghai High School Principal Zheng Xigu was invited to give a speech. The speech was divided into two parts. (A) Regarding the association, (1) from the perspective of the association's organization, normal education, primary school education, and local education have a close relationship, a kind of chain. However, among the three, local education should be the main body. (2) In order to seek the development of local education, normal schools should be established. Normal schools should also seek to connect with local education. If we only talk about normal education and experimental education without regard to local education, it will inevitably be empty. (3) The research results of this association can serve as a reference for running normal schools, experimental primary schools, and local primary schools, so that the direction of management can be determined. (B) Regarding local education, Jiangsu Province has the most funding for local education among all provinces in China, and Jiangsu is also the most promising in local education. We are in such a superior position, and we must make extra efforts. Here, I put forward my humble views for reference. (1) The most important task of local education in this province should be to popularize primary school education, first popularizing four years of compulsory education for children aged "8 to 12" and managing it in the most economical way. As for secondary schools, they should be run by the province. (2) Local education in this province should establish more "agricultural improvement zones." "Agricultural improvement" should be listed as one of the goals of local education to promote the increase of farmers' production. (3) Localities should use schools to improve society, making schools the center of transforming society, and teachers the soul of transforming society. Our school (Shanghai High School) is very willing to move forward on this great road.</p>

<h3>The Art Society of the China Vocational School</h3>
<p>Since the China Vocational School added natural painting courses to the civil engineering department last year and hired Professor Lu Erqiang, students in other departments have developed a high interest in art knowledge. Recently, they organized the China Vocational School Art Research Association to study South Asian advertising painting, window display art, industrial practical painting, architectural pattern painting, etc., with the aim of improving the aesthetic quality of industry and commerce. The inaugural meeting was held at 3 PM yesterday. Principal Jia Foru, Chief of General Affairs Zhao Ai'wu, and Dean of Academic Affairs Ling Zhenxi gave sincere speeches and served as instructors of the association.</p>

<h3>Record of Striking the Temple Bell in the Ancient Temple (2) (9) The Reclusive Scholar Does Not Remove the Courtyard Grass</h3>
<p>Thirty-Two</p>
<p>Back at the temple, I told Mr. Zhu everything I suspected and asked him to explain. Mr. Zhu said, "Now the government is promoting universal education on one hand, and on the other hand, children have to take exams to enter elementary school, even kindergarten. Shouldn't such a self-contradictory policy exist? My little brother isn't necessarily stupid, but he failed the elementary school entrance exam four years ago. I had no choice but to teach him at home. Elementary school entrance exams are truly the biggest joke of the twentieth century. We absolutely cannot use entrance exams to eliminate children when running a school here. We can only accept one after another; that's what education in the Republic of China should be. If someone wants to learn to be a citizen, you say you have to test them first. Okay, they can say, let them learn well, and then you can test them. Or they can ask, 'If I don't pass the exam, don't I need to learn to be a citizen?' What can you say to that? You say there isn't enough funding, not enough teachers, not enough room in the classroom. They can say those who pass the exam certainly won't be good citizens, and those who don't pass are even worse. Then shouldn't those who don't pass be admitted first? What can you say to that? If we embrace a 'no one refused' attitude, there will be no contradiction. Moreover, I run a school like Han Xin commanded troops: the more, the better. You're worried that I can't handle it alone, which is reasonable. But there are plenty of people in the village, not just me. Let me ask you, 'Can I teach ten people by myself?' 'Of course!' 'If ten people learn something in the first hour, can they each teach ten others in the next hour?' 'Yes!' 'Good. In this way, one person teaches ten, ten teach a hundred, and a hundred teach a thousand. It's not impossible. Just look at the best armies, where training flows consistently from general, division commander, brigade commander, regimental commander, battalion commander, company commander, platoon leader, to soldier. Then you'll understand that my idea is achievable. Let me tell you my plan. I want to recruit teachers first and then students, but actually, I want to recruit senior apprentices first and then junior apprentices. My method is: the master teaches the senior apprentices, and the senior apprentices teach the junior apprentices. Even this isn't quite right. What I really want is for the senior apprentices to teach the junior apprentices and to teach themselves. That's it! That sentence fully expresses my idea. There are still many days before school starts. You can take me to meet the children and adults in the village. At the same time, you can invite them to come to our ancient temple to play and chat anytime. This way, before school starts, I can recognize who can be a senior apprentice. Once we find a few masters and dozens of senior apprentices, we can create an education for the entire village from the life of the entire village. Zhong'er! You are among the oldest of the senior apprentices. But you must understand that I am not necessarily your master, and the masters are not necessarily me."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Sports Reporters' Farewell Dinner: Shen Siliang Expresses Important Opinions</h3>
<p>Three Tasks for Trip to America 丨 Attending Purely as a National Citizen</p>
<p>Regarding the Pseudo-State's Participation in the Congress 丨 Decision to Temporarily Ignore It</p>
<p>丨 Expressing Opinions on a Five-Year Plan for the National Sports Conference 丨</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Siliang, honorary director of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation and vice president of St. John's University, will depart for America on the President Coolidge on the 24th of this month to attend the Tenth World Olympic Games. Shanghai sports reporters from various newspapers held a farewell banquet at the Ditmars Hotel last night at 7 p.m. In attendance were Pei Shunyuan of the Xinwen Bao, Hui Yanhua of the Shishi Xinbao, Teng Shugu of the Shibao, Ma Chonggan, Sun Daosheng, Jiang Huaiqing, and Shen Zhenchao of the Shenbao, accompanied by Ling Xiangqian. The atmosphere was filled with laughter, and while having infinite hopes for the future of our country's sports, there were also many reflections.</p>
<h3>A Cup of Water and Wine to Wish You a Safe Trip</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Chonggan was the first to offer a farewell speech, saying that Mr. Shen would travel across the ocean to represent our country at the World Games, and hoped that he would report back to us on the major trends in the advancement of world sports. He presented a cup of water and wine to wish Mr. Shen bon voyage. Mr. Shen then followed with a speech, containing many important points, especially those that we urgently want to know. The record is as follows:</p>
<h3>Resolved to Go to America After Careful Consideration</h3>
<p>I (Mr. Shen referring to himself) face many difficulties on this trip to America and particularly regret not being able to lead our country's athletes. There have also been criticisms from various parties. Recently, due to rumors that the pseudo-state would participate in the Congress, some have even advised me not to go. However, after careful consideration, if our country, because of the pseudo-state's participation, sends no representative at all, will that really benefit our country? Since there is no benefit, I have resolved to go to America.</p>
<h3>Three Tasks for Trip to America</h3>
<p>I have three tasks for my trip to America: (1) To attend the Executive Committee of the Congress as a representative of Mr. Wang Rutang, chairman of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation, in his capacity as a member state. (2) To attend the World Sports Conference, where world sports experts will gather to discuss and improve the implementation of a world civilian sports plan. (3) To observe the Congress and also to meet friends and relatives in America.</p>
<h3>Temporarily Ignore the Pseudo-State's Participation</h3>
<p>Regarding the pseudo-state's participation in the Congress, I have repeatedly been asked for my opinion and actions. I originally wanted to telegraph the Congress to inquire about the truth, but after telegraphing Mr. Wang Rutang, chairman of the Federation, and Mr. Zhang Boling, president of the Federation, they replied that I could ignore it, or it may be Japanese propaganda. If our country becomes alarmed and fearful because of this, it will only reveal weakness and fall into the Japanese trap. We should wait until they actually participate before deciding on our course of action.</p>
<h3>The Charter States They Have No Qualification to Attend</h3>
<p>Athletes competing in the World Games must have their amateur status certified by a generally recognized sports association in their country before they can attend. Therefore, the pseudo-state's athletes must also be certified by the Federation. Since the pseudo-state has no recognized amateur sports association organization, it cannot be a member of the Congress, let alone participate in the Congress.</p>
<h3>The Congress May Accommodate the Japanese</h3>
<p>As for the previous examples of India and the Philippines, India and the Philippines each have their recognized amateur sports associations. However, since the pseudo-state is being registered by the Japanese, the Congress may accommodate them in order to avoid trouble from the Japanese. If that is the case, I will do my best to protest in the Executive Committee. The outcome is unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Must Be Resolved by the Diplomatic Authorities</h3>
<p>If, as the Japanese propaganda suggests, the two gentlemen, Yu and Liu, are forced to go due to various unavoidable circumstances, their every move will be closely monitored by the Japanese. One can imagine how interesting that will be. As for the pseudo-state's flag appearing in the Congress, this would be a diplomatic matter that insults our country and must be resolved through negotiations by the diplomatic authorities.</p>
<h3>Attending Purely as a National Citizen</h3>
<p>I am going to America purely as a national citizen and have not received any subsidies from the National Government. However, the Federation will cover my travel expenses, which amount to about 5,000. Initially, the Federation submitted a memorial to the Executive Yuan, requesting that representatives be sent to the Congress due to its international significance. The Executive Yuan consulted the Ministry of Education, which issued a clear order not to participate due to the urgency of time. In fact, it would have been perfectly acceptable for the National Government representative to simply telegraph the local consul to attend.</p>
<h3>Opinions on the National Sports Conference</h3>
<p>Finally, regarding the upcoming National Sports Conference, I believe that action is better than words. Chinese sports must start from the basics. International competitions can be temporarily suspended, and we should focus on starting from elementary school. After five years, the results will be evident. The Federation is a mass sports organization and only plays a consultative and advisory role in the Sports Conference.</p>
<h3>Returning to Shanghai in Mid-September</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen's speech was cut short due to time constraints. It is said that Mr. Shen Guoquan is also traveling with him on his honeymoon. Mr. Shen will return to Shanghai around September 15th.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Quotations from Ninety-Three-Year-Old Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3>Similar sounds resonate, similar spirits attract.</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>These past few days, I have been very ill. When I received Zhongyuan's letter, my spirits were just beginning to recover, and Zhongyuan's thirst for knowledge, which vibrated between the lines, made me even happier.</p>
<p>The phrase "amber picks up mustard seeds" is something I saw in the Book of Changes. The version I read is the Tang Dynasty's Kong Yingda's Righteous Meaning, annotated by the Wei Dynasty's Wang Bi. In the Qian chapter of the Book of Changes, there is:</p>
<p>"Similar sounds resonate, similar spirits attract..."</p>
<p>Below it, there is a note:</p>
<p>"...Not only do similar things attract each other, but dissimilar things also attract each other, like a magnet attracts a needle, amber picks up mustard seeds..."</p>
<p>This annotation comes from Wang Bi of the Wei Dynasty, not far from the Han Dynasty. Moreover, phrases like "magnet attracts needle, amber picks up mustard seeds" are perhaps experiential tales passed down from elders of that time, and not something that Wang Bi discovered in the Wei Dynasty. I suspect that when Wang Bi read the sentence "similar sounds resonate, similar spirits attract," he thought of the fact that "dissimilar things attract each other" and used the common experiences of the time as evidence. Therefore, I surmise that the phrase "amber picks up mustard seeds" was discovered in the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>The Chinese discovered these facts long ago but did not conduct deeper research. As a result, "magnet attracts needle, amber picks up mustard seeds" ultimately became an old saying. Only after the influx of Western scientific knowledge into China did people realize that these old sayings actually concealed scientific principles.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Sports Performance</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Every year when pomegranate flowers bloom, the sports schools in Shanghai hold grand sports meets. This summer, the spirit was not diminished by the war. On June 18th, the Carnegie Physical Education School, in conjunction with other sports schools, held a sports performance at the Central Sports Field. Chinese and Western spectators were as numerous as bamboo shoots. The program had seventeen items, and the order was not well-coordinated. Tickets were expensive at two yuan, truly beyond the reach of the working class. The Yang family staff, wooden club exercises, skill-power boxing, sword dance, and games of the Southeast China and China schools gave every student an opportunity to exercise. These are good teaching materials for school gymnastics classes. Universal sports for the common people are especially urgent in a precarious and weak country. Look at how Soviet Russia compels workers, peasants, youth, and children to participate in sports. Their competitions emphasize the number of participants and de-emphasize the outstanding achievements of a few. Lenin said, "Sports in the hands of the proletariat is a powerful weapon." Should oppressed nations heed this? Should they heed this?</p>
<p>The female athletes all wore white shirts, black pants, soft-soled shoes, and short socks, exposing their legs. Their fine hair was cut short. Their fair necks were fully displayed. This is the most modern style of 1932. Instructors Chen Yongshun and Du Feiyu were both lively and enthusiastic. Their commands rang out like bells and chimes, audible throughout the field. The Qin sisters, Zhi Xue and Zhi Dao, graceful and charming, wore short-sleeved, long-hemmed cheongsams and performed ancient Chinese dances to Western music, which was quite unique. Their light singing and slow dancing were like butterflies fluttering. However, the trembling of their jade arms was not as graceful as the long sleeves of celestial maidens.</p>
<p>In the Western boxing matches, the Chinese also bravely participated. The results were much improved compared to previous Shanghai municipal sports meets. However, they were small and thin, which was regrettable. The Chinese nation, known as a nation of heroes, will soon be left in the dust by the historically short present-day Saxons and Japanese. The decline of the nation is no accident. The final scene, Greco-Roman wrestling, turned into a tragedy. U.S. Navy officer, Naysen Quelley of the fourth team, was thrown onto the hard cement outside the mat by a 300-pound fat man, Pei Qiaozhi. He was bleeding from his left neck and suffered a concussion. More than twenty years of hard training were ruined in an instant. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment. According to Dr. Zhang Senyu, his life was not in danger. At the same time, the referee announced that the championship was won by the U.S. Navy officer, as a warning to those who commit fouls and unethical acts.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Amidst the nationwide calls to abolish the civil war, the tragedy of the two Chens fighting in Guangdong has already unfolded before our eyes. Despite the efforts of all parties to mediate, they ultimately failed to turn hostility into amity. Regardless of who is right or wrong, in this critical moment of national extinction and population decline, discovering these traitors who do not love the country and do not care about the lives of the people, their myriad sins deserve the condemnation of the entire nation!</p>
<p>If our central authorities could exercise their powers, then the central executive and supervisory committees should have sternly reprimanded them long ago, the National Government should have issued a clear order of punishment, the Military Affairs Commission should have issued a circular to stop them, and the Control Yuan should have impeached them according to the law. However, the authorities remained indifferent and allowed things to take their natural course, ultimately leading to the deterioration of the situation. Mentioning "party discipline and national law" is truly unspeakable, unbearable!</p>
<h3>Record of Ms. Bao Xinquan's Personal Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Jia, from Hangzhou</p>
<p>Since late spring, art exhibitions have been surging like winds and clouds on the West Lake. First, the Chinese Painting Exhibition and the 9th Painting Exhibition of the Xiling Painting and Calligraphy Society. Following that was the Xiang Zu Painting Exhibition. On the 13th of the month, Ms. Bao Xinquan also gathered her personal works and held a public exhibition at the National Products Exhibition Hall. Jia, who was resting in his hometown, was able to attend the grand event. Moreover, Ms. Bao was originally a member of the Xiling Society. After six fleeting years of separation, meeting an old friend again today, and seeing her art has become so accomplished, Jia felt a surge of joy and thus dipped his brush to record it.</p>
<p>Ms. Bao first studied under the old Hangzhou painter Wu Kuran, painting flowers with a powerful and unique ink style. Later, she went to Shanghai and graduated from the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, seeking guidance from Bai Longshanren. Her paintings then directly approached those of Can Lao, with bold and unrestrained strokes that did not resemble the work of a young lady. Her calligraphy drew from Yan and Su, and she was especially skilled in stone drum script, entering the style of Deng Shiru. Jia knows many women who are skilled in calligraphy and painting, but Ms. Bao is truly a rare talent.</p>
<p>This exhibition featured over two hundred works, with paintings of pine and chrysanthemum being the finest. Among them was an eight-foot-wide horizontal scroll of an ancient pine, twisting and turning with lively spirit. It was said that viewers wondered how a weak woman could approach such a large painting and still be able to shed all traces of femininity, which was truly rare. Besides the ancient pine, there were wisteria, butterfly flowers, daylilies, and peonies, all of which were admired by the guests.</p>
<p>The venue was located on the upper floor of the museum's garden. The carved railings and painted scrolls reflected each other in a winding manner. The paintings occupied six-tenths of the space, with other calligraphy and fan paintings interspersed between them. The color scheme was extremely elegant. Browsing through them, one did not feel tired. It was a pity that the day after the opening, the wind and rain brought sorrow. A certain song connoisseur said, "Rain threads and wind flakes, misty painted boats." Ms. Bao's arrangement had already entered the realm of poetry.</p>
<p>The exhibition lasted for three days. Approximately four to five thousand guests attended. Ms. Bao was very diligent in greeting guests among the crowded people. Her father, the former governor Bao Liancheng, was full of vigor and often discussed art with the famous seal carver Han Dengyan in great detail. This showed that Ms. Bao's achievements were also due to the influence of her family learning. (Reprinted)</p>
<h3>The Englishman's View of Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>Englishmen who have no children often adopt from so-called foundling societies. In recent years, there have been many applications to adopt girls. One must register first and wait a long time to get one. According to the Reverend Butler, honorary secretary of the London Foundling Society, and Ms. Blackburn, honorary secretary of the National Foundling Society, there are many boys waiting to be adopted, but even more girls waiting to be adopted. Last year, the ratio of applications to adopt girls was three to one compared to boys. This is probably because those who do not expect to have children of their own feel that a son is only a son until he marries, while a daughter is a daughter for life, even if she must marry. Another reason is that many couples lost their only beloved son in the European war and felt great pain. Now, adopting a child, when they grow up, may still die on the battlefield, which is unbearable. Many adopters have expressed this sentiment. Furthermore, many adopters are retired female principals who have been surrounded by children and are familiar with the personalities of boys and girls. They feel that girls are gentler than boys. Still others who have no children feel that when the girl grows up, she can be a companion in their old age. For these reasons, girls are considered more valuable. It is said that we Chinese have always valued boys over girls, but now the English are exactly the opposite. Also, the saying "a son is only a son until he marries" is in perfect agreement with our Chinese proverb "marry off the daughter-in-law, sell the son." It is strange indeed.</p>
<h3>New Military Arsenal (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— ·Iron·Mi·Tuo</p>
<p>I have read Mozi's eleven chapters from "Preparing City Gates" onwards, which describe the dimensions of siege and defense weapons. Mozi spoke of stopping war, but war cannot be stopped by empty words. Therefore, preparation is necessary. Since ancient times, no one has described the accumulation of military equipment and machines as Mozi did. I wanted to compare and record them, adding military equipment from past dynasties to create a military arsenal. However, I was delayed by personal matters. I have often wondered why our country's catalogers have catalogs for agricultural tools, plants, and miscellaneous tools, but none for military equipment. Although there are records of swords and other things, they are merely ostentatious and strange. The lack of emphasis on military matters and the lack of knowledge about weapons have long been the case, which is why foreign invasions have come. This spring, I read Mr. Hu Yizang's article, "The Shanghai War and Military Equipment," and I admired its thoroughness and detail, which captured the essence of Mozi. However, Mr. Hu only described foreign countries and did not mention our own treasures. Although our country has few inventions, since the national crisis, there have also been patriots who have been inspired to create. Therefore, I imitated Mr. Hu, stole Mozi's idea, and created the "New Military Arsenal" as the beginning of a military arsenal for the future. I also hope to encourage creators in our country.</p>
<p>Anti-Aircraft Gun</p>
<p>The anti-aircraft gun was invented by Mr. Gai Weixin, a factory worker at the Northeast Arsenal. The caliber is 40 millimeters, the barrel length is 120 millimeters, and the weight is 62 pounds. Direct firing can reach 3,500 meters in nine seconds. Flat firing exceeds that, reaching 4,000 meters. The mechanism is smooth and easy to use. The shells are armor-piercing, incendiary, and fragmentation. Beyond 2,500 meters, they can explode without touching anything. It was tested in Beiping and achieved miraculous results. The raw materials are all sourced domestically, without relying on foreign imports. Each gun costs 250 national currency coins, which is only one-fiftieth of the value of a foreign anti-aircraft gun. Mr. Gai never studied, but gained all his knowledge from experience. He also created five other new types of guns, all of which are ingenious and practical. The hand-held machine gun is especially good.</p>
<h3>Music at the Crossroads</h3>
<p>— Yan Meng</p>
<p>Recently, I moved to the French Concession and often take leisurely walks on Avenue Joffre to see the world clearly. My temperament is sometimes particularly strange. I don't necessarily love to stroll under the moonlight at night; I also like to brave the cold air and wander on windy and rainy nights. On desolate rainy nights, the feverish streets of Shanghai can get a moment of solace. Even wild horses must have a moment of stillness.</p>
<p>When I was in Hangzhou, I often liked to follow the blind fortune-tellers along the banks of the lake, listening to their three-string lutes in the bitter rain. From their mournful string sounds, I could understand the true meaning of life. They themselves bore a bitter fate, yet specialized in predicting fortune and misfortune for others. This is the ironic and contradictory nature of life. Secondly, their tunes were played too movingly. Skilled plucking produced a rhythm as natural as melody. It was a symphony of human fate and the blind man's journey.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, the blind man's three-string lute was not as common on the streets as in Hangzhou. What I usually heard were mostly decadent and subjugated tunes! Gradually, I forgot the blind men's mournful songs of the bitter rain. Running around for food and clothing all day, I no longer had the leisure to listen to songs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to be walking again on Avenue Joffre, which has replaced North Sichuan Road in prosperity. The misty rain curtain was weaving, and the lights were dimly flashing "unsatisfied." That mysterious street was unusually deserted. In the French Concession, especially near Avenue Joffre, there were magnificent mansions of the rich everywhere. Each was building their own paradise on top of hell. The sound of cars, how boastful? The big restaurants and movie theaters were all places of satisfaction for the rich.</p>
<p>However, there, I heard the most sorrowful and moving elegy in the world. It was not the zither music played by jade fingers behind gauze windows, nor was it the string music emanating from dance halls and pavilions. Like the weeping of cuckoos in spring, like the light warbling of yellow orioles at midnight, it filled life with vitality and sang of the injustice, imperfection, and hatred of the world. A white Russian wanderer, walking in the wind and rain, spreading the wrinkles on his forehead, was shouting, was hissing, was sobbing, was bitterly replacing the Volga boatmen of red Russia.</p>
<p>The rain was falling non-stop, his singing like the candle of love...</p>
<p>Walking forward with big steps. I did not understand all the lyrics he sang, but the mournful singing was as melodious as the flowing water of a deep stream, gurgling, sonorous, rolling in the breeze. He sang of his wandering experience, sang of the sleepy eyes of the world. Like celestial music, it reverberated in the space, remaining in my memory. His sound waves faded away, yet I was still stunned, standing in the wind and rain, trying to recall its flavor.</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: Powerful Figures Violate Principles, Fortunately Comforted by Women in the Boudoir</p>
<p>Helpless, Mao Deshun said it that way. Since it was a misunderstanding, it should be cleared up as soon as possible. If you don't accept it, I'm afraid they'll misunderstand you even more, thinking you find it too much or too little, which would be even worse. Brother, think about it. Isn't this putting me in a difficult position again? It's all your fault for harming me by coming in disguise. I'm not wrong to say that today, am I? When An Yutian first heard him call him "Brother" and "Little Brother" in such a sickeningly sweet way, goosebumps rose all over his skin. He thought that the trinket he had bought with money today was a new form of well-intentioned insult. It was different from yesterday's flavor. However, adhering to the teachings of tolerance in all matters, he tried to learn to endure the insults and gradually settled down. After he finished saying those glib and strange words and even hesitantly replied with polite words such as "Please help me, Chief, I hope the Chief will accept it," Wan Jinsheng immediately withdrew his hand, let An Yutian sit down, and shouted, "Little San, make tea and bring cigarettes," treating him warmly. When Mao Deshun asked on his behalf when he could see the Commander, he sat back in his wicker chair and said with a smile, "The Chief just arrived at the signing room. He'll be up in a moment. Originally, Elder Brother An's matter is also Miss Eight's matter. The Chief treats it differently. I'm just helping out a little. It's really nothing. Wait until it's successful, and I'll ask for wedding wine to drink." As he spoke, he took out the two checks from his pocket and pretended to push them back and forth, still wanting to return them. An Yutian inevitably had to accompany him in this farce, struggling to refuse. Finally, he supported himself by resisting and still put them into his pocket. Mao Deshun was also grumbling from the side, helping An Yutian by singing the same tune. Wan Jinsheng saw that the time had come for the right result, so he said with a smile, "There's no way. I'll thank you then. Fortunately, Elder Brother An is very generous, and we're all our own people, so we're clear that this isn't my personal matter. There are several dozen colleagues in the office, including those who run errands above and all the old maids and servant girls, all of whom are expecting everyone to share it. Every time a festival approaches, I handle official business impartially and even have to present a general account to the Chief for his review. There's absolutely no personal corruption." As he said this, he remembered that he should show his true colors at the moment, so he immediately stood up again, opened the door curtain, and asked aloud, "Which one is on duty?" Then another Major Cheng Qiyi walked over and replied, "It's me. What's the matter?" Wan Jinsheng then loudly instructed, "Councilor An is giving everyone two hundred dollars. Thank him, everyone. There aren't many guests upstairs right now. It's a good time to take Councilor An to see the Chief. Hurry up and go." By this time, most of the people sleeping in the room had been awakened by their voices. One by one, they were leaning on their pillows, looking at An Yutian with fiery eyes.</p>

<h3>Initial Drop and Subsequent Rise in Gold Speculation</h3>
<p>Result: A Continued Increase of 5.1 Taels</p>
<p>Fluctuations of Over 10 Taels: Yesterday, the 20th, gold speculation first declined and then rose again, with a sharp trend and significant fluctuations throughout the day. There were about 10 taels of fluctuations in retrospect, followed by a continued increase of slightly more than 5 taels. However, the silver market saw the British pound rise while the U.S. dollar remained stable, and exchange rates increased significantly, leading to a weak morning market. The cashiers of various firms differed, and there were no major changes in foreign exchange. The U.S. dollar appeared to loosen, and the intentions of various firms seemed unfocused, causing prices to fluctuate slightly by two or three taels. It is reported that foreign cables indicate that smaller nations plan to reduce tariffs and raise silver prices, hoping to alleviate the economic depression. At that time, the price of gold fell as a result, retreating from over 31 taels to within 27 taels, before slightly easing. Later, the market for drafts tightened due to active buying, with major firms like Fuxing Yong, Daxing Yong, and Zhifeng Yong actively participating, and prices flourishing, soaring by more than 8 taels, eventually reaching a new price of nearly 737 taels. As for those who have not yet rolled over their contracts this time, Qian Changxiang and Yifeng Yong have the most long positions, totaling about 7,000 contracts. Hengyu and Zhifeng Yong also have more than 2,000 contracts. Short positions, such as Run Changyu with more than 3,000 contracts and Dade Cheng with more than 1,000 contracts, and various smaller accounts, totaled about 9,800 contracts. Compared to the previous Saturday, this represents a decrease of more than 1,000 contracts. Rollovers also occurred yesterday, ranging from slightly more than 6 taels to 4 taels. The total number of contracts for the August period held by various firms is said to be about 18,000. The details of yesterday's events are recorded below.</p>
<p>Gradual Decline in the Morning: The August period opened down 3 taels, at 728 taels and 8 mace. This was because the large-scale contract from the previous day had increased by another sixteen分之一. Although the price of silver did not fluctuate, the impact of the 75-point increase in exchange rates caused a 2-tael rebound. Dalian banks and Hengyu both entered the market, while Guang banks Hengxing and Yifeng exited. At 9:10, Zhifeng Yong re-entered, and Qian Changxiang, Yifeng Yong, Bingxing, and Tong Taichang also entered. Furthermore, as the foreign exchange market stabilized, HSBC initially sold November British gold at 18375 to banks such as China and Japan, then absorbed 8-month gold at 3125, Hua Bi absorbed July U.S. dollars at half a yuan, and Sumitomo absorbed October gold at 31 yuan, gradually increasing the price by 3 taels. At 9:15, it was 31 taels and 7 qian. Shortly after, Dalian banks and Yu sold, causing a retreat to 28 taels and 7 qian. By 9:30, HSBC's British pound quote had not changed, and U.S. and Canadian dollars were at 125. However, smaller accounts entered the market at 30 taels and a half, to 29 taels and 8 qian. Later, Qian Changxiang, Yiyu, and goods came to buy, and the wheat merchants bought July U.S. dollars at half a yuan, and each Feng sold October British gold at 375 to Bombay, pushing the gold price up to 30 taels and 06 qian. After 10:00, the selling wind suddenly prevailed, and Hengyu, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Dayong, Dade Cheng, Yifeng, and Yuan Mao, among others, dumped their holdings. News also spread about the U.S. purchasing silver and proposing silver associations, causing widespread panic, and the price plummeted by three or four taels, reaching 26 taels and 8 qian at 11:00. Later, HSBC and others absorbed October U.S. dollars at one yuan, Sumitomo bought August British gold at 3125, and Xie Xingyong, Dalian banks Fuyu, and Tong Taichang entered the market, causing an increase of 3 taels, reaching 29 taels and 7 qian at 11:30. By noon close, it was 29 taels and 1 qian.</p>
<p>Sudden Sharp Turn in the Afternoon Market: The afternoon market opened at 29 taels and 2 qian. Later, due to sales by Yuan Maoyong and Zhifeng Yong, it dropped by 1 tael and 1 qian, reaching 28 taels and 3 qian at 2:20. Hengyu, Qian Changxiang, Hong Kangyong, and Dade Cheng all entered the market, further boosted by the rising foreign exchange market, with banks absorbing October U.S. dollars at 9375, causing prices to surge by more than 2 taels, breaking through 30 taels. At 3:00, Fuxing Yong, Hongxing, Daxing Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Yuan Mao, and Zhifeng Yong successively competed to buy, and it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had fallen by sixteen annas. At that moment, the market sentiment turned sharply upward, adding five or six taels, with a flourishing outlook. As for the U.S. dollar, firms tended to settle, with August at 5625, September at 75, and October at 8125. At 3:30, it was 36 taels. At this time, Hengyu, Yifeng Yong, Hengxing, and Fuyu all sold, causing the price to plummet by 2 taels, reaching 34 taels at 4:00. However, buying interest remained strong, and contracts on the table were quite scarce. Zhifeng Yong continued to enter the market, but exchange rates were flat, and the gold price had risen by another two or three taels. By the 4:30 close, it was 36 taels and 9 qian, an increase of 5 taels and 1 qian compared to the previous weekend. The maximum price for the day was 36 taels and 9 qian, and the minimum was 26 taels and 8 qian, with a fluctuation of 10 taels and 1 qian. The exchange had a double closing price measure, adding 12 taels and a half to the naked contract.</p>
<p>Underestimated Clearing Price by 8 Taels: The clearing price, based on the U.S. exchange rate, had been changed to 800 taels, with an underestimation of 70 to 73 taels. In the afternoon, it was 71 taels and 2 qian, and finally 63 taels, 8 taels less than the previous Saturday because the U.S. dollar quote had increased by 125. The bookkeeping price was 34 taels for June and July, 29 taels for August, and 42 to 37 taels for the afternoon market, with a supplement of 34 taels. In the afternoon, it was 42 taels.</p>
<p>A Glimpse into the Transactions of Various Firms: According to on-screen transactions, Xie Xingyong, Tongchun, Chunhe, Tong Taichang, Yuanxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, and Shunli all entered the market, while Zhifeng Yong, Yifeng, Hong Kangyong, Yuan Tai, Futai, and Yuan Mao all exited. Dade Cheng, Yuan Maoyong, and Wanxing had occasional entries and exits. In the afternoon, Dade Cheng, Shunli, Hongxing, Hong Kangyong, Daxing Yong, and Fuxing Yong all entered the market. Zhifeng Yong's exits were fewer than its entries. Wanxing, Yuan Maoyong, Yu, Hengxing, Dehe, and Yifeng Yong all exited. Dalian banks' total entries and exits balanced out, totaling about two to three hundred contracts. Guang banks exited 1,300 contracts.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market: British Pound Tight, U.S. Dollar Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, there was no telegram regarding the silver market, but yesterday's telegram showed continued growth. The U.S. dollar remained unchanged, and exchange rates rose, leading to a stable British pound and a soft U.S. dollar in the Shanghai market. HSBC's U.S. dollar quote increased by 125, amounting to 30 yuan, and the French franc increased by 1 yuan, while the German exchange rate decreased by 25. The British, Indian, and Hong Kong currencies remained unchanged. As for the actual transaction prices of banks, the British pound remained consistently flat, while the U.S. dollar softened and then stabilized, resulting in a decrease of 0625 for the British pound and a flat result for the U.S. dollar compared to the previous Saturday. The gold market experienced ups and downs, with 10 taels of fluctuations throughout the day. Trading among banks was still lively, with about 200,000 pounds of British gold traded. Gold firms sold slightly, and there was considerable interbank trading. HSBC sold forward positions, and Bombay telegraphed October. U.S. dollars amounted to over one million.

<h3>Call Loan Rate Still Trending Weak</h3>
<p>Silver Dollar Transfers are Relatively Cumbersome</p>
<p>Market Overview: The call loan market has fluctuated daily, with no major changes, but the overall situation is still weak, with no hope of progress. Therefore, the market experiences both rises and falls, with no new developments. Other silver market trends remain stubborn and unstable. In general, there are no signs of improvement. Currently, the demand for silver dollars is weak, so there is no possibility of a boom. Yesterday's market situation was still on a downward trend, which is the reason.</p>
<p>Call Loan Rates: The selling pressure for "silver dollars" was strong in the morning, causing market sentiment to weaken. Compared to the previous day's afternoon market, it decreased by a small half li, to 6 qian, 9 fen, 3 li, 2 hao, and a half. The noon market was even softer, and buyers were even more unenthusiastic, ultimately falling one li from the morning market, to 6 qian, 9 fen, 2 li, 2 hao, and a half. The "silver call loan" rate was 8 fen for both the morning and noon markets, weaker than the previous day. The situation appeared soft, but the internal structure was still tight, so the premium suddenly rose to 1 qian, 3 or 4 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market: Jiangnan small silver dollars, after falling in the morning and afternoon, did not change yesterday. The morning and noon markets were both at 5 qian, 9 fen, and 9 li, with only 2,000 jiao traded in the morning market. Guangdong small silver dollars were 5 qian, 8 fen, and 6 li and a half in the morning market, a sharp decrease of 1 li and a half from the previous day. The noon market slightly recovered by half a li, to 5 qian, 8 fen, and 7 li. There were 260,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 70,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins decreased by 1,000 wen, to 417,000 wen, with 32,000 strings of wen traded.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver funds" were stronger yesterday because it was Monday, and banks were open. Hua Shang received 2.3 to 2.4 million in ticket funds, foreign businesses collected over 2.4 million in ticket funds, various goods, exchange taxes, and other funds collected over 10.9 million, warehouse deposits of 1.1 million, Qian Zhuang and silver public list collection of 27 million, premiums funds collected over 4.6 million, various exchange funds collected over 700,000, 1 million paid out in cash, and over 4.67 million in discounted ticket trades. "Silver dollar funds" made 845,000 in exchanged tickets and 65,000 in banknotes in the morning market and 540,000 in exchanged tickets and 15,000 in banknotes in the noon market. Also, off-market banknotes were 120,000 in the morning and 40,000 in the noon. Bank transactions were 750,000 in the morning and 500,000 in the noon. Qian Zhuang public list collections amounted to over 5.9 million. Silver dollar premium fund collections over 2.3 million. Silver dollar call loans over 1.5 million. Banknotes were recovered and issued over 1.56 million. Bank trading with silver accounts over 1.5 million. Small Qian Zhuang traded over 600,000.</p>
<h3>Difficulty in Lending by Silver and Money Businesses</h3>
<p>Since the closure of silver and money businesses at the end of May, the current month (June) could have been a time to expand and make up for the first half's profits. However, the results were contrary to expectations, and all hopes were dashed. Those familiar with the situation say that the current business plans of most Chinese banks are similar to those of Qian Zhuang, relying on lending as their only source of profit. This year, due to the unfinished settlements from the previous closure, old debts have not been paid, and new debts have been suspended. Therefore, lending, which was once the only source of profit, is no longer effective, and reliance on collateral loans, foreign exchange, or securities investments is not as appealing. Qian Zhuang are facing even more difficulties because they have different natures than banks and are more cautious with their lending. Therefore, currently, only old customers or depositors can open new accounts, and it is difficult for other stores to establish a trading relationship. It is even more difficult to discuss accommodating adjustments.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Rebound by Six or Seven Jiao</h3>
<p>Active Buying and Over 5.6 Million in Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday (20th), the bond market of the Chinese Securities Exchange saw few spot transactions, with only 18,000 yuan traded throughout the day. The futures market, however, saw prices rise sharply, and the market was active with buyers and sellers. Total transactions for the morning and afternoon amounted to 5,655,000 yuan, with salt tax accounting for 1,385,000, unified tax and 20-series close to 1 million, and 20-series opening at 740,000. Other bonds were around 300,000, while 96-series, whole 6-series, and customs duties were very low. As for the trend of bond prices, it was driven by news of a turnaround in the domestic situation, leading to optimistic market sentiment and sellers taking a wait-and-see approach. Although large buyers did not make significant transactions, small investors were actively investing, leading to a situation where demand exceeded supply and bond prices rose across the board. As a result, the current month contract of the unified salt tax and the June and July contracts of the 20-series all rose by about 9 jiao, while the spot price of the 20-series customs duties rose by 1.3 yuan. Other bonds also rose by about four or five jiao, leading to a positive market situation.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Extremely Dull</h3>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Bank)</p>
<p>The New York stock market on Saturday was extremely dull, with only 300,000 shares traded in half a day. There were no major fluctuations in prices. Only Sears Roebuck (a famous mail-order store) and Auburn Automobile shares saw more trading. The former fell to a new low due to reduced interest rates, while the latter fell sharply before rebounding at the close, but still fell 2.5 points compared to the previous day. Gasoline stocks were relatively strong, due to the recent increase in Gethslingen prices. Railroad stocks remained unchanged, which is unprecedented this year. Utility stocks rose an average of 0.14, the strongest. The market is not expected to improve in the near future, but prices are not expected to fall further. The Dow Jones Index is attached below:</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Beyond Redemption</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn prices are falling again, and the situation is very weak, due to the poor surrounding environment and the economic depression everywhere. The political turmoil in Guangdong Province has not been resolved, leading to increased market anxiety. The sales of yarn are stagnant. Only Shu Gang has fragmented amounts of activity, but there is a lack of large amounts. In the early market, Geng Feng and Chang Feng dumped large amounts of yarn. It is said that this was entrusted by foreign merchants. The world's price of yarn is lower than that of Chinese yarn, so they are mostly selling their holdings. The 40-tael mark is unlikely to remain stable.</p>
<p>Large Speculators Sell: The market was very weak at the opening of the artificial cotton market due to large speculators selling. Each month's decline was one, two, three, five, and six qian. The market continued to decline at the opening of the afternoon market. At the closing, there were transactions with the Sichuan Gang, and it rebounded again. Each month's decline was two and three qian. The total volume for the day was 29,000 bales. Yu Da sold 1,400 bales, Geng Feng 1,400 bales, Sen Kang 1,000 bales, Chang Feng 2,150 bales, Xie Sheng 850 bales, and Sui Long 800 bales. Ji Feng bought 1,100 bales, Yu Kang 900 bales, Chang He 1,450 bales, Yong Da 1,050 bales, and Tong He 600 bales. The closing prices for artificial cotton are listed below:</p>

<p>Spot Yarn Transactions Were 1,000 Bales: More spot yarn was used than on the previous day. Statistics show that all of the gangs bought 974 bales, trading houses bought 40 bales, and merchants bought 25 bales from Changsha, 380 bales from Sichuan, 170 bales from Guangdong, 10 bales from Zhenjiang, 50 bales from Xuzhou, 60 bales from Luzhou, 25 bales from Ningbo, 140 bales from the interior, 40 bales from Yunnan, 15 bales from Wuhu, and 10 bales from Xiamen. Prices are falling.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Turns Downward Again</h3>
<p>The cotton market trend is weak, the selling wind rises again, because the situation of American cotton is mediocre, the situation turns downward again, and the environment deteriorates, and factory demand stagnates, and the yarn price suddenly relapses, making it difficult for people to calm down. There is also a saying that the Tianjin cotton market news has fallen. The local silver root is very tight. A part of the banks sells the goods on collateral in Shanghai, so the market feels more and more decadent and unmotivated. However, the cotton merchants in Shen are still in the long position, holding tightly, and not letting go. In short, the world trend is like this, how can this cotton be the only strong one? The future situation is really unpredictable.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao One Drop Five Cents: Zheng Biao Before Noon Market Opening, with the American cotton market fatigue, the atmosphere in the market is even more weak, and each month fell three or four cents. In the afternoon, it fell one cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 41,900 dan. Dafu sold 3,100 dan, Hengyi 1,000 dan, Changhe 1,400 dan, Tongmei 1,200 dan, and Yu 1,500 dan. Cheng bought 1,400 dan, Dachang 1,200 dan, Yifeng 1,400 dan, and Gengfeng 1,800 dan. The closing prices of Zheng Biao are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao, Closing Price Increase Decrease, Balance, October 2855 Drop 35, 141,200</p>
<p>July 2790 Drop 50, 59,700, November 2880, 45, 152,600</p>
<p>August 2815, 45, 105,600 Total 459,100</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Is Silent: Spot cotton sales consumption is cut off. Each factory has absorbed enough foreign cotton, with no intention to purchase. Moreover, the yarn market is falling, and the cotton market is even more difficult to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Cotton Market Declines More Severely, West River Cotton Opens at 21.5 Taels</h3>
<p>Tianjin News (16th): The West River cotton market declined more severely, and there were no large-scale sales activities. The Japanese Mitsui Trading Company bought 200 bales, opening at 21 taels and 5 qian, a sharp drop of 2 taels from before. The local cotton reserves are also said to be abundant, about 2 million bales. Many cotton merchants went bankrupt, and the financial industry suffered significant losses. The banks lost more than 2 million taels.</p>
<h3>Grain, Rice Market, Arrivals, Sales Both Weak</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday's rice market had sources from all around the 17th and 18th, but the number of shipments in storage was still high. Retail sales in cities and villages were limited. The freshness of the thick japonica rice was set. The price of the middle grain fell one or two jiao. The arrival of thin indica rice was sparse, with scattered transactions of three or four hundred stone. The price remained the same as before. Foreign reed tips and metamorphosed yuan were unremarkable.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, approximately 25 to 26 numbers arrived on the west road. Trading on this street was not very active. In the morning, the opening price of Changxi North japonica rice was tight, with the second-best slightly soft. In the early and late rice and the flying phoenix, merchants bought nearly 1,000 shi, with the price tight at about jiao. The price of riverfoot millet was about 1,000 shi.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Trends Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Decline by About Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, imported rice became increasingly weak. The number of small polished rice arrivals was high, with current reserves of more than 1.3 million bags. In addition to other rice reserves, the total amount of reserves was even higher. The rate of consumption has been slow for several days and is getting worse. Yesterday, high-quality small polished rice was priced at 10 yuan, while the middle and lower grades were priced as low as 9 yuan and 8 jiao, a decrease of about jiao from the previous weekend. The Tong Market was handled by the Nanjing Gang, buying 1,000 bags of small polished rice. The Mainland Gang handled 200 bags of old rough small polished rice. All other transactions were weak. Local village households continued to provide food. The Tong Market opened 3,000 bags of small polished rice, priced at 10 yuan to 9 yuan and 8 jiao, 500 bags of Saigon Grade 1, priced at 11 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, 200 bags of old small polished rough rice, priced at 8 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, and 400 bags of red small polished rice, priced at 9 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, with each item down about one jiao or so from the previous market.</p>
<h3>Small Numbers of Nanjing Early Season Rice Arrived at Port</h3>
<p>Since the market was flooded with imported rice, prices were low. It was difficult for merchants of all kinds of rice to make profit. The number of shipments in storage was low, and the market was only supported by imported rice. This year, the sources of rice, apart from Wenzhou and Taizhou, which still have shipments arriving, mostly consist of a small amount of Anhui rice handled by the rice mills themselves. Not many merchants arrive from the capital either. Nanjing machine-milled rice had not been seen on the market for a long time. Yesterday, wholesalers tried to ship more than 100 bags to Shen. They were peddling it on the market, but a deal was not reached because of price negotiations.</p>
<h3>Spot Goods Available for August Standard Flour</h3>
<p>Factory Efforts to Maintain</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, each contract month was quoted at the foreign wheat price, and still decreased by 123 jiao, causing anxiety again. The opening price for each month had fallen by about a tenth of a cent compared to the previous weekend. Only until the second session, did it suddenly increase, with an increase of two or three points compared to the initial opening price. It is said that Fuxin's standard flour still requires a deduction of 9 qian and a half. However, for merchants who buy August flour, they can also withdraw the spot goods, so the August standard flour became more popular as a result. However, it is now June, and the factory can withdraw August flour. This is an exception, which inevitably makes people suspicious. When the afternoon market opened, the trading of each month became smooth, but the market has fluctuated. It fell by one point compared to the morning, and since this kind of temporary excitement is difficult to sustain with actual sales, it will inevitably remain weak. As a result, July was up by 2 li and a half, August was up by 7 li and a half, September was up by 5 li, October was up by 7 li and a half, and November was up by 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Once Improved in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market remained calm during the morning session, with trading exceptionally quiet. This was due to the low quotations for imported wheat, which dampened buying interest. However, the market atmosphere turned bullish in the afternoon session. The earlier rebound in the flour market boosted buying sentiment, pushing prices up by three to four points compared to the morning closing prices. This surge was fleeting, and prices soon declined again, mainly because domestic wheat prices remained favorable for arbitrage selling. Consequently, the July contract improved by one point compared to the previous week, the August contract remained unchanged, the September and October contracts improved by two points, and the November contract improved by five points. Spot wheat prices remained stagnant due to weak demand from flour mills, with no reported transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: "Precious Eyebrow" Green Tea Shows Signs of Activity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, British firms such as Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and others started purchasing "Precious Eyebrow" green tea from Tunxi, Wuyuan, and Shexian. Wuyuan "Precious Eyebrow" tea was offered at ninety-eight taels, Tunxi tea at ninety to twelve taels, and Huizhou tea at eighty-five taels, indicating a developing market trend. Current tea prices have reached rock bottom, and there is overseas demand. This has led to a more active green tea market. However, there were no major transactions in Qining black tea yesterday. Regarding "flower-scented" tea, the Russian Aid Association is said to have counter-offered at twelve to thirteen taels, but new prices have not yet been released.</p>
<h3>New York Silk Telegrams Still Sparsely Transmitted to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Lyon Spot Sales Were a Flash in the Pan</p>
<p>Domestic Merchants Hope to Stock Up at Low Prices</p>
<p>In the local foreign silk market, spot sales of raw silk, such as "White Filature," experienced a brief surge. However, intense competition from Japanese silk sales overseas caused the Shanghai market to quickly calm down again. French firms and speculative merchants hope to stock up on raw silk at low prices, waiting for an opportunity to sell at favorable prices. However, Chinese silk is not cheap, making it difficult to absorb the sell-off. Due to large imports of Japanese silk, few silk telegrams were sent from New York last week, and the prices offered were not high. Chinese silk merchants are holding firm, and transactions are pending. The future of the foreign silk market remains uncertain.</p>
<h3>Gray Serge Piece Goods Suddenly Become Popular Due to Shortages</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for wool fabrics showed slight improvement. The general trend in the guild was slightly better. There was demand for tribute wool, "Walter" wool, serge, "Chocolate" wool, and Northern Sichuan fabrics. The Western tailoring shops in this street also needed to purchase twilled cotton cloth, yellow twill, "Palais" wool, "Fat Special" wool, white serge, and white tribute wool. Plain gray serge, which was extremely sluggish last year, has become popular again due to limited market supply and a lack of new arrivals. As customers suddenly started purchasing it, the trend suddenly improved significantly, boosting the market atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Grain White Sugar Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the Sugar Market Guild was even more active. The market atmosphere was quite good, with prices gradually rising. The initial trading price for Dutch No. 24 coarse grain white sugar was from thirteen taels nine mace two fen to nine fen five li, with strong demand. The price for ordinary goods ranged from thirteen taels nine mace to two fen five li, and later rose to thirteen taels nine mace five fen li. Hong Kong goods ranged from thirteen taels seven mace five fen li to seven fen half li, with brisk buying and selling. The market was generally bullish. Dutch No. 8 red sugar was priced at nine taels seven mace, and No. 9 goods at nine taels nine mace five fen li, also showing a strong trend. There were still few transactions for Taikoo sugar. B Mark was sixteen taels one mace, CW Mark fifteen taels nine mace, H Mark twelve taels four mace five fen li. The market showed stability. Hao Pan had a large dealer offering 500 bags of Dutch No. 8 red sugar at nine taels six mace five fen li. Zhenxiang sold 2,000 bags of Hong Kong coarse grain white sugar at thirteen taels seven mace. Huaxin sold 1,700 bags of original coarse grain white sugar at thirteen taels nine mace five fen li. Trading firms showed strong interest, creating a bullish market with further upward potential.</p>
<h3>Hardware: French Western Nails Fall in Price</h3>
<p>The trading of French Western nails has been unusually sluggish recently. Many firms in other cities are purchasing locally produced nails, and local construction companies are also using domestic products, leading to a significant decline in the French Western nail business. Prices have steadily declined. Yesterday, the opening price was only seven taels seven mace five fen li per barrel, a drop of several qian compared to before. Due to oversupply and weak demand, the market is stagnant, and sentiment is weak. There is a continued downward trend in prices. However, small sizes, such as three to six fen, have relatively better prices because local factories are still producing them in small quantities. Three fen nails were estimated at twelve taels, four fen at twelve taels five mace, five fen at twelve taels two mace five fen li, and six fen at twelve taels. Transactions are still reasonably satisfactory. It is said that more than a hundred barrels were sold yesterday to firms from the Yangtze River and Fujian.</p>

<h3>The Turkish Bluebeard</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>A Constantinople telegram from the 16th reports that Turkish robber, Offa Chinshim, was arrested in his cellar today after being reported to the police by his twelfth new wife. The cellar was found to contain the bodies of at least eleven women. The robber confessed to the police that he specialized in luring women by promising marriage, then taking them home, forcing them to hand over money and jewelry, and then murdering them.</p>
<p>This is clearly a foreign swindler. Although there are swindlers in our country, their methods are not as cruel. Their only goal is money. Rape is merely their means to an end. Once they achieve their goal, they either flee or sell the women into prostitution. Murder is rarely seen.</p>
<p>According to the robber's confession, his actions were caused by reading the history of the French robber Bluebeard, Landru. This shows the great power of popular fiction, and authors must be careful about what they write. For example, recently, there have been cases of four apprentices from a rice shop secretly leaving to seek enlightenment and teachers after being influenced by popular martial arts novels. The same is true of movies. Authors and actors create based on their imaginations, with wild and fantastic ideas. Young people with simple minds often believe them to be true. The harm they cause to young people and society is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Some may say that martial arts novels - not just martial arts novels - have always existed in our country. Why didn't they cause crimes in the past, but now they do? In the past, young people were bound by the old Confucian etiquette. Even if they had ideas, they dared not try them rashly. Now that the old etiquette has been broken, many young people dare to act and are eager to try. This kind of thinking is not necessarily a bad thing. It is originally a good thing. The progress of thought lies in this. However, nowadays, most young people often do not learn the good things, but only learn the bad things. Therefore, they succeed in reversing evolution, which is extremely worrying.</p>

<h3>General Yuan's Song</h3>
<p>— Meng Shao'an Master</p>
<p>Last year, when the violent Japanese bandits invaded, Yuan Chonggu, the brigade commander of the Xing'an Ridge Reclamation Army, led his artillery troops to support. When crossing the river, the cannonballs could not be exposed to water, so they were tied to the top of their heads to cross. The ice cut into their bones, and no soldier was unscathed. I heard this and lamented, so I wrote a song:</p>
<p>Do you not see the precipitous peaks covered in snow, white against the sky? For thousands of years, there has been no human habitation. Below lies an unfathomable abyss of dragons. Armored like mountains, they march on the ice. General, you go to fight the devils. Brave soldiers struggle to be ahead. The shadows of people in the middle of the stream are less than a foot high. Their heads are like frosted leaves, and the ice is like a knife. Iron cannonballs press on their heads, their faces unwavering. Nine out of ten die crossing this river. Upon landing, how many are still whole? The general shouts, and they rise again. Tomorrow, they will kill the bandits at Jiangqiao. Ten thousand cannons roar like thunder, opening the sky. Enemy cavalry fall in confusion, covered in dust. The victory report shakes the court. They only talk about the merits of the Longjiang horses, but the general's merit is no less. His loyalty and righteousness are unparalleled, able to startle the cowardly demons. Now I know the Northeast is not without heroes. The general is even more outstanding among men. I await his success in spreading his glory. I will forge my pen like a hundred-refined sword.</p>

<h3>Fresh Fruit Preservation Method</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiaotao</p>
<p>Ordinary fresh fruit can only be stored for a few days, and they often rot. This is very uneconomical. There is a method that allows fresh fruit to be stored for a long time without rotting, just like fresh. I will introduce it below for everyday use:</p>
<p>(1) Soil Preservation Method</p>
<p>Dig a rectangular pit in your yard that is just large enough to hold the fresh fruit. Fill the surrounding area with soil and sand. Cover the top with a thin layer of soil. If the ground is relatively dry, you can add two or three layers of fresh fruit. This pit should be placed under a ventilated roof. Special attention should be paid to the urine of people, cats, and dogs, and it should not be allowed to flow in because the urine of cats, laborers, and meat-eaters contains a strong acidity that can cause it to rot.</p>
<p>(2) Grass Preservation Method</p>
<p>Place the fresh fruit in overgrown grass, spacing each piece apart. Cover with leaves. Rain can keep the fruit skin moist. This method should be carried out on a high, sloping ground. Water will not stay at the fruit in rain. After two or three times of rain, erect a shed about three feet high to shield from the rain. Both of these methods can last for several months.</p>
<p>The above two methods are useful for everyday home use. The first method is more practical than the second. Fresh fruit should be checked twice a month. Be careful and gentle when checking. Remove any rotten fruit. However, it is not easy to select and store fruit. It is best to select fresh fruit without blemishes.</p>

<h3>Mr. Wang's Party Principles Class</h3>
<p>— Zhiqing</p>
<p>In an atmosphere of complete disorder, Mr. Wang, the Party Principles teacher, walked into the classroom with his lecture notes.</p>
<p>He was a very kind teacher, never scolding his students. He always had a smile on his face and taught the students earnestly. Judging from his accent, he was from Chongming. He wore simple clothes. His knowledge was vast, and he was always so humble.</p>
<p>However, students are always like this. When strict teachers teach, no one dares to say a word or do anything else, not even daring to glance out the window. But when these kind teachers come, it becomes a riot. So the kind Mr. Wang said gently,</p>
<p>"Party Principles is indeed a boring subject, but if you pay attention, it can be of value for you to study."</p>
<p>"But, Mr. Wang, we never studied Party Principles in junior high school," said one student nicknamed "Little Reporter."</p>
<p>"That's not possible. Where did you study before? How could there be no Party Principles? Moreover, the Ministry of Education..."</p>
<p>"No, no, I didn't say there was no Party Principles. I said that the Party Principles teachers in junior high school were always sick or attending meetings at the county party headquarters, so it was the same as not having studied."</p>
<p>The whole classroom burst into laughter, and several students shouted,</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, he's making trouble, making trouble..."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang still spoke gently, "That shouldn't be called making trouble. At most, we can only say he's having fun! And I know he wouldn't make trouble. Perfect, now we have a good topic, I'll use the word 'trouble' to explain."</p>
<p>The whole classroom laughed again.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang gathered his spirits to speak, and the students' voices seemed a little quieter. Some were whispering about the movies at Guanglu and Guotai yesterday. Some were talking about the misses across the street with whom they were familiar. Some were throwing notes, full of "my beloved." Some were eating peanuts, some were reading novels, and some were asleep. The three or four students who were praised as bookworms were listening quietly.</p>
<p>An hour passed. Party Principles was a double period. Mr. Wang was full of energy and continued to speak. The students continued to attend class in the same way.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, class can be dismissed, there are only ten minutes left."</p>
<p>"Sitting on the hard benches for two hours, my butt hurts."</p>
<p>The classroom became lively again.</p>
<p>"How many wives did a certain great man marry? Mr. Wang,"</p>
<p>"His first wife is very jealous, isn't she?"</p>
<p>"But some people say she's in love with a certain actor,"</p>
<p>"I heard that when X was studying at the Japanese Military Academy, someone took his exams for him. Is that true, Mr. Wang?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk about anything else, his Chinese is very poor. Now he has actually become an important person in China. China is truly doomed,"</p>
<p>The kind teacher still treated the students gently. He answered the students' many reasonable questions with what he knew. However, the students' questions were endless.</p>

<h3>A Letter from My Younger Brother</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>Brother,</p>
<p>I know that empty words are useless. Although we are half-brothers, Dad is still our Dad. Although he rebuked you in the newspaper with a stern tone for wandering the world, I secretly observed the old man's words and actions every day. How could I bear it?</p>
<p>On the eve of my second sister's wedding, she secretly asked me if I had a letter from my eldest brother. Everyone on the surface of this joyous event was smiling and exchanging pleasantries with the guests, but the irrepressible hidden pain made me cry for half the night. Especially at dinner, Dad held his wine glass, his eyes fixed on the wall in front of him, trembling, and said, "What if Jin'er marries a wife!..." Brother, the old man's deep love for his children, in his words, didn't he hope that you would return soon? At that time, Fifth Sister asked Dad, "Why didn't Big Brother come back to eat my second sister's wedding feast?" Brother, the old man actually cried. Brother, old age is the most bitter experience in life. Dad is in a dilemma and finally burst into tears. That's why I said Dad is still our Dad. Please understand the old man's declining years and come back to comfort his empty heart.</p>
<p>Second Sister was carried away in the bridal sedan chair with a heart that had not seen her eldest brother. Dad probably also thought of his desolate old age and couldn't sleep. After crying bitterly, I felt relieved. I got up with my clothes on and wrote this letter, gazing at the clear and bright moon. Brother, your younger brother has packed his bags and is waiting for you. If you don't return within ten days, I will also wander the world, sharing your joys and sorrows. Xue, your brother, on a moonlit night.</p>

<h3>Predictions</h3>
<p>— Yan Meng</p>
<p>Marriages after 1940: Modern girls will succeed in the suffrage movement, and women's rights will be even more surging. A new law will be promulgated, implementing polygamy to satisfy both the body and soul of girls.</p>
<p>In 1935, China was recognized as the world's leading country. The reason for obtaining this position and belief was because China's peace policy was amazing; first calm down, then long-term resistance, the whole country cheered, celebrating the victory of non-resistance!</p>
<p>In the same year, the World Peace Conference opened. The Chinese civil war expert was publicly elected chairman, and the veteran warlord reported China's loyal sacrifice of itself for the future of human peace and friendship, enduring the pain of war. Everyone clapped their hands, and the representative proudly took it as an unparalleled honor.</p>
<p>In 1938, China established a bragging academy and sent talented people to lobby in various countries, persuading foreign governments to select talented people to come to our country to receive new education for further study. At the same time, they will receive the highest spiritual civilization subject, peaceful struggle.</p>
<p>In 1938, German nudist sunbathing - naturalism, Chinese fashionable men and women are also practicing. Zheng Xiaoxu and other stinking old relics committed suicide because people's hearts were not ancient.</p>
<p>In 1936, enlightened politicians advocated public talent in order to solve the unemployment problem, but those over middle age with pure fire were qualified, and those who could smoke opium were even better. This can not only avoid the radical thoughts and actions of young people, but also promote the public sale of opium and remedy financial difficulties!</p>
<p>In 1944, national vagrant education was popularized, and there were 500,000 doctors. According to accurate statistics, 300 million people were unemployed.</p>
<p>In the same year, parks were built throughout the country for the homeless to wander. The country's exquisite pavilions are luxuriously decorated. Even the construction cost of the toilets is more than ten million gold yuan, surrounded by rose garlands. Unemployed vagrants sing hymns in unison.</p>

<h3>Reply</h3>
<p>Reply to Letter 1: To Mr. Song and Mr. Wei Nong. This publication has limited space and no room to publish lengthy novels. Moreover, there are already lengthy novels in "Free Talk." Publishing them again seems redundant. It is difficult to handle satirical paintings for a while, so please wait. This is a special reply. The Editorial Department of this publication.</p>
<p>Reply to Letter 2: To Mr. Wang Liheng. We have received your letter requesting a subscription. Regarding your questions, we now answer as follows: (1) The scope of direct steam chlorination and sulfurization products is quite wide. The matching method is determined by technicians through experience. However, the matching method is slightly simpler and easier to start with than other hot sulfurization methods. (2) Sublimed sulfur is a light yellow powder used in the direct steam sulfurization method. It does not need to be dissolved. Gasoline is only used for bonding. Sulfur is mixed with the compound in a mixer with the rubber sheet to form a mixture. If the sulfur is melted, it is a sulfur bath method, not this method. (3) Zinc oxide is a kind of white pigment, which has the effect of improving rubber. It is often used in industry for white materials. Due to space limitations, the rest will not be described in detail. Shen Zhibin replied.</p>

<p>Civil Rulings:</p>
<p>Yi Li Company's application for the cancellation of provisional attachment: Having read the petition, the cancellation is approved, and Mr. He Sui, the agent of the applicant, is requested to come to the court immediately to claim the security deposit. This is the ruling.</p>
<p>▲ Wei Wenzeng's application for cancellation of the case: Having read the petition, the cancellation of the case is approved. This is the ruling.</p>
<p>▲ Du Zimei's application for execution: Having read the petition, since the case is under appeal, the request should be considered later. This is the ruling.</p>
<p>▲ Qian Fengyu's application for re-mediation for the debt owed by Lin Fuyao et al.: Having read the petition, the case was previously scheduled for mediation at 9:00 a.m. on January 30, and a legally served notice was received by both parties with proof attached to the file. Both parties failed to appear in court without reason, and the mediation was declared unsuccessful. The statement in the petition that the mediation was not scheduled for a long time is a lie and is not true. As for the request to schedule another mediation date, it is not in accordance with the law and is difficult to approve. Please file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. This is the ruling.</p>
<p>▲ Yi Yuan Zhuang et al.'s request to add provisional attachments and schedule a joint auction: Having read the petition, the Shanghai First Special District Local Court sent a letter on May 7 of this year regarding the goods owed by He Feng Zhuang to Yuan Changxiang, stating that the debtor's property had been seized, etc. The letter sent on the 6th of this month stated that the seized debtor's property would be appraised and auctioned. Therefore, this court handled it accordingly. As for the provisional attachment for the goods owed by Yi Yuan Zhuang to Yuan Changxiang, it was only reported to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court on the 6th of this month. After the creditors filed the case, the attachment was implemented on the 15th of this month. This court handled both cases in accordance with the original court's official letter and legal procedures, and there was no difference between them. The request for a joint auction is under investigation. This case has not yet been approved by the First Special District Local Court, and it is impossible to predict whether the judgment has been finalized. It is difficult to handle. If there is a risk that the provisionally attached goods will not be sufficient for compensation, the money obtained from the auction should be transferred to the original court, and the applicants should directly request the original court to retain it for joint distribution. This is the ruling.</p>
<p>▲ Yi Pin Bank, Lu Linsheng's application for cancellation of the case: Having read the petition, since it is claimed that the debtor Zhu Jinsheng has reached an out-of-court settlement to end the matter, the application for the cancellation of the case should be approved. This is the ruling.</p>
