<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>毌忘甲午戰役的敎訓　彬</h3>
<p>在距今二十八年前的清日甲午戰役中。我們曾蒙受了一次慘痛的敗衂。這一次敗衂。便定下了我們二十八年來長處於日本凌　轢宰制之下的命運。台灣朝鮮之被割以至去年九一八東北各省之被佔取。都是以此一戰爲其關鍵。</p>
<p>這一次的戰爭關係尤爲重大。爲我民族是否尙能維護其生存自由之最後試騐。如此戰而敗則我民族將從此陷入更慘酷之悲境。永永末由振拔。故我國人須一致認清此戰意義之重大。</p>
<p>甲午戰役之失敗。不是偶然的本來滿清的本身先已具有了種種必敗的條件所以才一敗而不可收拾。</p>
<p>第一。當甲午戰爭爆發之先日本早已有一戰的决心。當時駐日公使汪鳳藻駐韓公使袁世凱駐英法公使龔照瑗。都告日本有戰意。清政府　頇終始持國力未充不能與的主戰。張不早備戰。以致倉皇應戰。一敗再敗土氣旣墮。遂一蹶而不可復振。第二。外交情勢。日益緊急。而清政府內部。仍互相傾軋。互相牽制。李鴻藻翁同龢輩更乘機參奏李鴻章三大罪狀。李的增兵計劃。遂爲其所阻。日人陸奥光宗曾斷爲「清庭自殺其國家」。實爲的評第三。戰事旣已發動。自應全國總動員。共起作戰。但當時則惟有李鴻章懷抱决心。倉皇應戰各省者觀望不前。强敵迫於外。權臣牽於內。欲不敗而不。得戰後西批評謂「日人非與中國戰。乃與北京政府戰。非與北京政府戰。乃與李鴻章一人戰」由此我們可以想見當時國內的散漫如一盤散沙之情勢了第四。戰爭開始之前。日人在軍事上旣積極準備。在外交上亦充分佈置於各國情勢。都極明晰。所以能運用自由。而我方在外交上。則耳目手足呼應無效。運轉不靈。每事隔閡。在外交完全陷入孤立的窘境。第五戰幕旣已揭開即應極力堅持。準備長時期之苦鬥。但當時清政府還未到無法應戰的地步。即屈服乞和。所以喪權辱國造成二十八年來橫被宰制的惡果。「能戰而後能守能守而後能和」爭取勝利。在最後的五分鐘。這一點在目前我們尤其應該記牢。</p>
<p>上列的五點。都是甲午戰役致敗的原因。即是我們在今日所應重復回溫的課程。與所應鄭重領受的敎訓。</p>
<p>上海事件</p>
<h3>敵軍主力戰已失敗</h3>
<p>昨晨血戰後無劇戰</p>
<p>各路僅有斷續砲聲</p>
<p>分投派遣飛機軍艦</p>
<p>擾我沿海沿路各處</p>
<h3>廟行江灣戰况</h3>
<p>敵重創後全綫岑寂</p>
<p>我軍固守兩鎭陣地</p>
<p>昨日廟行及江灣方面、雙方無甚重大接觸、僅有大砲互轟、我軍所發砲彈、多中敵軍後方、敵方則仍用巨額大砲、向我廟行陣地轟炸、但未有重大損害‘惟廟行前里許一帶田地經敵軍兩日夜砲擊後已無一片乾凈土、砲彈所炸窟洞、恰似蜂窠、我軍陣綫仍完整無變動、江灣我軍前綫、在距跑馬廳二百碼處、江灣車站及江灣鎭、仍在我軍手中、一無變化、雙方步哨、不時槍擊、但未有激戰、</p>
<p>敵重創後一蹶不振日軍於前日藉援軍之助、於下午二時·六時·及十一時許、接續三次、自廟行以迄江灣全綫向我總攻、被我軍歷次擊退後、其方調前綫之第十一師團損失甚重、尤以小塲廟竹園墩受創最巨、當我軍進逼時、幾已失其戰鬥力、故昨日敵軍陣綫甚爲沉寂、想又另謀變更戰略矣、昨日上午十時廿五分起敵方以大砲猛向我軍轟擊後、我軍亦起、還擊至十一時、許敵飛機在天空偵察、並在大塲及廟行投擲炸彈、我方高射砲瞄射不息、因此砲聲甚密、江灣方面亦有日機投彈、敵方步哨不時以步槍向我軍施射、我軍沉著不應、敵恐中計、乃旋息、惟雙方砲轟、有加無已、我軍前綫兵士均伏處戰壕中、以敵軍始終無動靜、故亦不予追擊、鞏固防務、敵砲轟至下午五時許、漸趨平息、晚十一時、沿各該綫未有發生戰事、</p>
<p>廟行江灣敵軍陣綫　昨據我軍某中級人員談、敵自攻江灣不得、改攻廟行後、現在攻廟行之敵軍、已被殲滅、外間屢傳廟行頻危、江灣失守等等、盡屬謠傳、總之我軍决與死拚、即剩一兵一槍、亦與抵抗、現我軍自廟行以至江灣一帶防線、迄無變動、江灣廟行兩鎭、仍在我手、最前線已越竹圍墩·小塲廟·孟家宅·金穆宅·敵軍最前哨兵在白漾宅·周家宅·梁印宅云云又據他方消息言敵在白漾宅以東、軍力達一萬四千、在江灣跑馬廳以北、梁印宅以東、確有第十一師團之步兵約九千名駐守、</p>
<p>敵坦克車全失效力敵自以鐵甲車坦克車作侵略工具後、不料連戰皆北、且蹈中我地雷、燬壞十餘輛、因之該項車輛至今、已專作砲壘之用、每輛外圍沙包、盤踞戰塲要隘處、不復再作衝鋒陷陣、其亦自知龐然笨重、燬去一輛、損失甚大、故前昨兩日、敵攻竹園墩·小塲廟·趙家宅·水車頭·等處已屏棄不用、蓋該處地爲低窪、泥土潮濕、港　紛歧、尤爲坦克車鐵甲車所忌者也、</p>
<h3>閘北雙方砲戰</h3>
<p>敵軍屢攻失敗</p>
<p>砲火雖猛無益</p>
<p>閘北天通庵八字橋一帶、日來戰事、較爲沉寂前夜吾方集中砲火、向敵猛攻、敵軍憑壕頑抗、雙方激戰甚烈、至昨日拂曉敵始不支而退我軍除將前哨線移進外、並不窮追、至下午五時、敵又反攻、但人數不多、僅用大砲轟射、我方亦以重砲還擊、雙方激戰約一小時、敵因進攻失利、即向後退、不敢再衝、至晚八時半起、敵又用重砲轟我陣線、或斷或續、亘數小時之久、毫未得手、直至今晨半時左右、尙聞斷續之砲聲、</p>
<p>中央社接二十六日上午三時路透社消息、閘北方面華軍、今晨對日軍防地、開始猛烈砲擊、迄今砲聲已達一小時之、久現日軍防線內某處中砲起火、現尙在燃燒中、預料華軍將利用夜間對日軍開始攻擊、因閘北日軍、已大多數調往江灣、守兵頗爲薄弱、現華軍尙未對日領館及日旗艦砲擊云、</p>
<p>吳淞司令官譚啓秀氏</p>
<h3>吳淞方面戰况</h3>
<p>敵艦輪流開砲</p>
<p>敵機亂擲炸彈</p>
<p>毫未損害我軍</p>
<p>吳淞要塞方面、敵艦於前日曾有數次、向我開砲攻擊、昨日上午、敵艦十餘艘、均停泊天夾水外、並未開砲、惟至下午漲潮時、有三艦向我輪流開砲、潮落時、即行停止、蘊藻浜方面之侯家木橋紀家橋一帶、敵軍於昨日上午、向我陣地進攻、同時並有敵機六架擲彈助戰、我軍固守無變動、茲將戰况分紀如下、</p>
<p>敵艦漲潮時進攻淞口三夾水外洋面、現泊有敵艦十餘艘、距離砲台火綫甚遠、昨日該敵艦等、未向砲台攻擊、惟每逢平潮時、即派敵艦三艘、向淞鎭輪流往來發砲轟擊、一俟潮落、即行退出口外、張華浜附近浦中、現無敵艦踪跡、又據昨日由淞來滬士兵稱、吳淞前日（二十五）早八時起、停泊於三夾水洋面、日艦十三四隻、頻用大砲轟擊、直至昨晨尙未停止、白盡且有飛機亂擲炸彈、我軍咸伏戰壕中、待其逼近時始還擊、實則與我軍軍隊毫無損失、而民宅巿屋盡成瓦礫、竟無一間完整、其砲彈大部來自口外、小部則來自浦江內、所停敵艦上者、昨日敵有一運艦載敵軍約千名又在張華浜東北企圖登岸、當被守兵擊退、至少死傷、亦須在五六十人云、</p>
<p>昨晨敵攻泗塘河昨日吳淞　　薀藻浜之正面、兩軍仍隔河對峙並無接觸、沿南泗塘河之侯家木橋、紀家橋、（侯家木橋距吳淞十八里係江灣境、紀家橋距吳淞十里、均係寳山縣屬楊行境、一說胡家莊、）等一帶、敵軍於昨日上午八時許、突增派重兵、向我軍陣地進攻、同時並有敵機六架、擲彈助戰、我軍在該方面築有堅固戰壕、兵力亦至爲充厚、故敵軍砲火雖猛頗能應付裕如、張華浜附近一帶敵軍陣地內、已不若前數日之沉寂、敵兵均異常忙碌、三兩成組、由淞滬鐵路運輸軍　送往前綫、九時許並有小輪一艘、拖帶駁船三艘、裝載敵兵四百餘人、及大批軍用品、由滬駛至糧米碼頭、敵兵登岸後即行轉道開赴火綫、該方面戰事起後、至下午益形劇烈、截至下午三時許、、雙方尙在相持中、</p>
<p>大批敵機擲炸彈又據另一報告稱昨晨七時許、淞口航空母艦上、又飛出敵機十三架、計有燬炸機七架、偵察機六架、至吳淞外馬路一帶擲下炸彈數枚寗商救火會高樓着彈炸燬、並殃及海濱醫院、經我軍開放高射砲、始見六架飛往西北方面、七架至江灣一帶而去八時後、日艦發砲十餘響、彈均落於砲台灣獅子橋田間、又昨日下午一時、日飛機一隊三架、又向薀藻浜方面投下延燒彈數枚、未幾遂即起火、因無人施救、至下午三時始熄、</p>
<h3>敵艦到白龍港</h3>
<p>轟我岸上平民</p>
<p>敵機掃射村農</p>
<p>川沙白龍港、昨有敵艦兩艘、會同老洪窪之另一軍艦、頻頻開砲、轟我岸上平民、又於昨晨六時許、飛到敵機數架、用機關槍向地上村農掃射、但我軍早有準備、並未受有損害云、</p>
<h3>日艦砲轟乍浦</h3>
<p>加以飛機助戰</p>
<p>但均未能得逞</p>
<p>浙江平湖附近乍浦口岸、停泊日本軍艦三艘、昨日下午二時許、突向我駐軍開放大砲十餘響、艦上之陸戰隊、意圖乘勢登岸、卒以我軍防範嚴密、遂未得逞、昨晨更有日飛機五架偵察乍浦口形勢嗣復來十一架、偵察數分鐘即去、</p>
<h3>昨晨敵機飛杭與我空軍激戰</h3>
<p>敵機十五架往筧橋擲彈　　我機十架當即飛起應戰</p>
<p>接戰十分鐘敵機即退去</p>
<p>我機四架機員兩人微傷</p>
<p>昨日上午六時半、敵軍遣派飛機十五架、飛至杭州筧橋飛機塲、投擲重量炸彈、我方因事前未得報告、當時僅飛起十架應戰、其餘不及起飛、衆寡懸殊、故略有損失、茲將詳情紀述如下、</p>
<p>本埠所得消息云昨日上午六時半、有日戰鬥機十五架、由高橋起飛、向海外繞道飛至筧橋、盤旋空中、竟圖抛彈轟炸我航空塲、適時我航空塲停有飛機十三架、有十架即時飛起應戰、餘三架因不及飛起、當被轟略受微傷、日機抛彈約十餘枚、（全係重量炸彈、）其時該站對面有草</p>
<p>屋一間、亦被炸毁車站人員、莫不驚慌異常、但該站幸未殃及、當我機在空中與日機戰鬥時、我駐軍亦用高射砲轟擊、日機不敵、紛紛逸去、至午時許、又有日機三架、沿滬杭鐵道飛至艮山門一帶、並在空中視察約數十分鐘後、轉飛至臨平站</p>
<p>對面翁家、坡盤旋一週、幸未擲彈、惟筧橋長安硤石一帶、嗣後仍有日機多架飛行、直至下午六時、始飛返高橋、</p>
<p>本館杭州專電云、日機由滬循路綫飛杭、計五隊、共十五隻、在筧橋擲彈、落荒地、爆發一枚、我機飛往驅逐、日機逸去、午後又至、飛經城站、盤旋回滬、</p>
<p>路透社二十六日南京電云、航空處發</p>
<p>表今晨杭州空戰之公報如下、今晨黎明後、日轟炸機三架、追逐機十二架、共十五架、忽飛至杭州、中國飛機十架即與迎戰、另有飛機多、架未及飛起、日機即擲下炸彈、損中國訓練機三架、運輸機一架、惟所損甚微、可早修竣、當日追逐機十二架與我機交戰時、日轟炸機三架即逃去戰僅十分鐘、日追逐機亦向上海逃去、我駕機員兩人受微傷、敵一機落於杭州灣附近、機身已毁機師亦斃命、</p>
<h3>敵放棄轟炸法</h3>
<p>擬改用機關槍衝鋒</p>
<p>我久戰兵士所弗懼</p>
<p>敵人連用重砲飛機、向我軍轟炸、結果除平民遭殃外、於我軍陣線、毫不變動、聞敵人因屢次失敗、將放棄轟炸戰法、而改以機關槍衝鋒、但吾軍均係久戰之士、敵决不能得逞云、</p>
<h3>民船裝置馬達</h3>
<p>日軍又有詭計</p>
<p>昨日下午四時許、記者步行至黃浦灘、適某汽輪停泊該處、記者與該輪管理者相識、晤談之下、要求其沿浦江駛行一次、藉資考察、當蒙允諾、乃即啓椗向吳淞口駛去、但見沿浦江一帶、各國軍艦比麟停泊、往來船隻、已不若從前之多、經匯山碼頭將達黃浦碼頭時、忽見沿碼頭一帶泊有我國民船（無艙棚者俗名灘船）三十餘隻事近離奇、記者乃懇該輪司舵者並岸而行、及至駛、近則見無數高麗人、正在將每船後部裝置馬達、（機器）改成汽船、且已有二艘裝設完竣、在浦江內試航、每船上均坐有江北人二三十名不等、似在試騐該船載重及速度者、記者見狀、心中默忖、想必敵軍又將進行偷渡或竟有其他軍事上之新計劃、乃亟告歸惟臨返時、遙見該項船隻上、已有敵軍下船、想今晨或即晚、敵軍將實施其計劃矣</p>
<h3>我軍擊落敵機兩架</h3>
<p>敵機昨夜飛眞如投彈　　結果於我方毫無損害被我閘北駐軍擊毁之敵軍鐵甲車（李子洋攝）</p>
<p>昨日下午二時左右、敵機三架、由東飛至閘北一帶偵察、在共和新路·交通路·一帶擲彈、當塲炸死數人、毁壞民房多間、下午五時許、飛往眞茹、亦擲彈轟炸、意圖擾亂吾後方、晚九時許、敵機又往眞茹無線電台附近擲彈、但無損害、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>閘北炸死多人日飛機二架　　自昨日下午一時五十分起、即在閘北空中翱翔盤旋、繼而至共和新路·中興路·及交通路·潭子灣·等處投擲爆裂彈七八枚炸死男婦老幼多人、實屬慘無人道、遭殃各處記之如次、㈠共和新路五彈、毁瓦房十餘間、死苦力鹽城人、李錦章家男婦及小孩五人、㈡中興路三彈、毁草屋五間、㈢太陽廟路大統路西十餘彈、毁江北草棚十餘間、死傷苦力及男女小孩多人、㈣交通路潭子灣巿府第三平民住所屋頂、亦有敵機飛過擲彈、飛機擲彈時、我軍事當局、恐住民遭損害、隨即派人往各處勸令出境、故一時扶老携幼、拖箱帶篋、向交通路西首逃避者不少、至五時後、即斷絶交通、不許行人往來、馬路間一望如洗、</p>
<p>夜飛眞茹投彈昨晚九時許、敵人飛機數架、至眞茹附近擲彈、意圖炸毁、約十餘分鐘、始行飛去、此係敵機第一次夜出轟炸、但結果並無損害、又昨日下午五時許敵機三架在眞茹西三里之遙、擲彈十餘枚、炸毁民房十餘間、</p>

<p>日軍陣線殊欠鞏固大美晚報云、據軍事觀察家意見、日軍陣線殊欠鞏固、全恃猛烈之砲火遏制華軍反攻、日軍之後備兵似無多、人或竟無之、故連日祗能徐徐進攻、以保其陣地云、</p>
<p>日人亟盼援軍開到大美晚報云、東京傳來消息、陸軍省决計遣派	第十一師團與十四師團赴滬援助第九師團與第二十五旅團及海軍陸戰隊、上海日軍事當局現無刻不望援軍開到、茲已商請本埠引水公會隨時準備引水員若干人、以便引領運兵艦駛入淞口、已有外國引水員十六人受僱待、命援軍開滬消息、乃星期三日傳出、日人方面對於此事、嚴守秘密、僅謂今夜或明日不致開到、</p>
<p>昨日無日兵運到日本在滬陸軍迭次潰敗、傷亡官兵極衆、損失軍火更巨、自廿四日起、日本增派十一師團來滬援助、先後分二天裝到、統已加入前線作戰、查日本陸軍之到上海者總數已有三個師團一個旅團、與海軍陸戰隊六千二百名、今已無法抽調、故昨日竟日無日本援兵運到、而又無日本軍艦往來、但聞有一批日兵、已運在途者須今日可到、</p>
<p>日雇大批白俄到滬日軍自作戰以來、舉凡掘壕運彈、以及擾我後方等等、多用江北漢奸爲之、近來日軍以歷次戰敗、對於雇用江北人常有遷怒殘殺棄尸浦江之事、一般被誘迫之江北人、亦皆潛行逃出、日軍遂發電致東北、在長春大連哈爾濱各埠改雇大批白俄人來滬、供作前後方之軍用、第一批已由東北日軍代爲雇到白俄人四五百名、運到大連灣後即　乘大連汽船會社長春丸輪、　來上海、於昨日午後二時二十分進口、至三時五十分到黃浦碼頭上陸、該批白俄、統着破舊便裝、上岸時即有日軍官統率前去、支配各項軍事工作、</p>
<p>日本飛機共二百架大美晚報云、在滬參戰之日飛機、今據調查、約佔日本海軍天空戰鬥力之半、查日飛機在滬者、共約二百架、內有一百三十架、乃屬於泊於揚子江口之飛機母艦兩艘者、日海軍共有飛機母艦四艘、自植田第九師團到滬後、又增陸軍飛機多架、日司令連日以海陸軍飛機從事襲擊、、衆信實因步兵之戰鬥力、弱不足恃故也</p>
<p>敵人採辦糧物大批日軍來滬後、日需糧食甚巨、初由本國裝來、繼改大連運申、茲因兵多物少、不敷需求、遂又委托長江日輪、至揚子江各埠、利用在日人卵翼下之漢奸、至蕪潯漢各地採辦、昨日日輪岳陽丸由滬開赴長江、表面爲商行、實際係代裝軍用品至漢、並代滬上日兵購辦糧食菜蔬、願國人加以注意、　　日僑一萬餘名回國大美晚報云、自上海戰事發生後、上海及中國他處之日僑回國者、據日人佔計、共有一萬五千名之多、其中上海日僑佔一萬一千名、今留滬者僅剩一萬四千名、回國之日僑以婦孺居多、約佔百分之八十、男子則爲老年與因戰事失業之輩、</p>
<p>趕製薄棺裝殮官屍自滬戰開始迄今、日軍將校陣亡者日衆、必須運回本國、故强迫我國木匠四名、在乍浦路崑山花園轉有處中山汽車行、及大隆汽車行內、不分日夜、趕造白包薄皮棺木、以便運送前線、收殮將校屍首、爲運送回國之用、每晝夜趕製之數、約須十餘具　　月迺家花園焚兵屍暴日自侵滬而來、迄將一月、死傷纍纍、最初、尙能將兵屍、從容裝入麻袋、運回本國、自本月二十日總攻擊後、日兵死者已達三千餘名、傷者達六千餘名、如將兵屍、由前線運往匯山碼頭、必須經過吳淞路一帶、深恐引起日兵恐怖、又恐裝回本國、引起國內反感、故自二十五日起、就近在狄思威路月迺家花園、舉火焚燬、聞自廿五日起迄今、已焚燬一千餘具、現尙</p>
<p>在繼續焚燬中、</p>
<p>日日新聞報館中彈前夜虹口吳淞路乍浦路一帶、被中砲彈十餘枚、日文報日日新聞社於前晚十一點五十五分、中一彈、由三層屋頂穿入二層樓落於樓板上、但未爆發可云險、矣</p>
<p>敵將施用具釘板我方軍事當局、昨日接得探報稱、匯山碼頭前、有日輪大連丸一艘、裝有大批木箱箱、內滿藏鋒利之鐵釘料敵將施用「具釘板」、裝設於陣地前、以防我軍步兵之衝鋒、該輪並載有陸軍二百餘名、在匯山碼頭登岸、</p>

<p>策之合法基礎、諒爲君所棄知、時待　述、考門戶開放政策、一八九九年剏始於海約翰、所以終止烈强在華之勢力範圍、以免中國有分崩瓦解之虞、海氏制此政策有兩大原、則</p>
<p>㈠各國對於中國在商務上應有均等機會、㈡欲維持此均等機會、必須保持中國領土與行政之完整、</p>
<p>顧此兩大原則、在美國對外政策上當時亦非新創、我國與他國往來、早以此項原則爲本、特對華提出之者、蓋欲挽救當時之危局、以免此亞洲偉大民族之主權與未來發展、有妨害之虞、而世界各國間、亦可免除增加敵對形勢之危機、因其時中日間曾經開戰、迨戰事告終、另有三國出而干涉、阻止日本取得其所要索之某種戰利品、此諸國遂因是取得一種勢力範圍、而其後中國發生嚴重亂事、危及各國駐京公使、此亦爲造因之一、當各使署正在被玫之際、海約翰遂宣布　戶開放政策、作爲各國平定亂事應守之原則、海氏曾云一美政府政策在謀得一解决、俾中國可得永久安全與和平、保全中國領土與行政之完整、保護各友邦在條約與國際法上所得之權利、與保障全世界在中國各地方均等與公平貿易之原則、』海氏旣倡此原則、遂商得他國之同意、英政府尤熱　贊助、英首相蕯理伯勛嶎答復海氏宣言、曾極端鄭重表示贊同美國之政策、嗣後二十年間、開放門戶政策遂爲列邦非正式之任務、迨一九二一年至一九二二年間、與太平洋有關係各主要國家在華府會議、此項政策乃結晶成爲九國公約、而將其所由產生之兩大原則與以精當之解釋與精確之措辭、該約第一欵規定條約各國除中國外同意於</p>
<p>㈠尊重中國之主權　立及其領土與行政之完整、㈡供給中國最完滿最無妨碍之機會、俾可發展維持一富有效能而穏定之政府、㈢各締約國用其勢力、以期有效建立與維持各國工商業在中國全境機會均等之原則、㈣勿得在華利用情勢、求得特殊權利、以减損友邦人民之權利、亦勿得作暗中危害各友邦安全之行爲、</p>
<p>是故此項條約、係代表一審愼發表業經成熟之國際政策、一方面爲各締約國保證其在華權利與利益、另一方面爲中國人民保證有最完滿之機會、發展其主權與獨立、俾可符合今世各民族間維持之新式而開明的標準、而不受阻碍當該約簽字之時、舉世皆知中國正於新經革命之、後企圖由由專制政府逐漸發展、成爲一自治共和國之自由制度、第三經濟與財</p>
<p>政兩方面、將須經過多年之努力、方能達此目的、而其進步亦必遲遲所以此約實係各簽約國間自行檢束之公約、有意排棄含有干涉中國發展趨向之任何侵略政策、且信惟有此種手續、在此條約保護之下、最可以保障中國及與中國有關係各國之最完滿利益、當時美代表團在國務卿休士領袖之下、將此此約呈報總統時嘗稱、「現信中國門戶開放政策經由此約至少已成爲一種事實」、又當討論此約之際英國首席代表貝爾福勛爵曾稱、「英國代表團深知本會各國代表中無有視勢力範圍之習慣、再能爲任何政府所主張而爲本會所可容忍者、若就英政府言、固曾以最正式方法當衆宣稱、認此舊習慣完全不適宜於現有之局勢」、、又同時日本代表幣原男爵宣稱</p>
<p>「日政府之立塲、對於中國無人可以否認其自行統治之神聖權利亦無人可以阻撓其造成偉大之國家運命、」</p>
<p>迨此約告成、首由美·比·英·中·法·意·日·荷·葡·九國批准實行嗣挪威·玻利維亞·瑞典·丹麥·與墨西哥亦先後加入、惟德國雖經簽字、而其國會猶未批准、今又須牢記勿忘者、此約爲有關係各國在華府會議所締數種條約及協定之一、而此諸約皆互相關聯、互相依賴未有可以漠視其一、而不致擾亂全部諸約所欲造成之籠統諒解與均勢者、華府會議原以軍縮會議爲主、其目的在增進世界和平之可能性、第欲達此目的、不僅在停止海軍設備之競爭、且又須解决種種糾葛問題、足以危及世界和平尤其足以危及此種問題所牽緾之遠東和平、美政府本此九國公約之精神、遂放棄其戰艦製造之領袖地、位及打銷甘姆菲列濱繼續設防之計劃、蓋九國公約不僅保障世界東方商業機會均等、且反對任何國家武力侵略中國也、九國公約條文之修正中取銷、實無討論之餘地、自九國公約締結六年之後、此約所由基以成立之列强勿得侵略弱國的自行檢東政策、因巴黎公約（即所謂凱洛格白里安非戰公約）經世界各國之批准實行更得一有力之援助、此兩約者雖各自獨立、但係協調之步驟、期將世界之良心與輿論列成一線、贊成憑藉國際公法從事有秩序的發展之制度、此種制度包含用公道和平方法、代替暴力解决一切糾紛爭執在內、而保護中國勿受外界侵略之計劃、實爲此種發展之重要部份、此約簽字各國及參加各國、皆正確國覺使四萬萬人民居住之中有秩序的和平發展、實爲世界謀和平福利所不可少者、凡爲整個世界謀福利之計劃、决不能忽視中國之福利與保障、近日中國發生之事件、尤其自東三省發端而最近延及上海之敵對行爲、益令各約無修改之可能、亦更足以見與遠東有關係各國忠實遵守前述條欵之重要、吾人於此無須根究爭執之原因、亦不必在兩國間判斷咎責之攸歸、因其造成之局勢、無論如何不能符合前述兩約條文所規定之義務、苟此兩約能忠實遵守、則决不發生此種局勢、此種情形不必再問其原因與責任早已明白無疑、因此九國公約與巴黎公約簽字國凡與中日爭執無關者、皆未見有修改兩約條文之理由、且以其僑民在上海受有危險與損失、益見此項條約有忠實履行之眞價値、以上所述皆爲我國政府之見解、我人實未見有理由可以放棄此項條約所援用之開明的原則、深信此項條欵苟能忠實遵守、當可避免今日之局勢、亦未見有正當遵行此項條欵之美國務卿史汀生</p>
<p>後、行將妨及保護簽約國及其人民在華合法利益之證據、上月七日我國政府奉總統訓令、正式通知日本及中國、不能承認兩國政府違背此項公約所造成之任</p>
<p>何局勢、與締結之任何條約或協定、因此項公約有關於我國政府及人民在華之權利、設世界他國政府能有同樣决定、採取同樣立場、此種行動將可成爲一敎訓、今後當可有效的阻止由壓力或違背條約所取得之任何名號或權利、成爲合法行爲、更就已往歷史觀察、終將可以導至中國恢復其被人剥奪之權利與名號、我國爲太平洋大邦之一、深信中國人民前途無量、我人循公平及忍耐與彼此善意之原則、與其往來、必能博得最後勝利、我政府向來對華政策、皆以此爲準繩、我人深知中國政治家發展其國家與政府、事絶艱巨進步必緩、其獲得負責任政府之</p>
<p>企圖、不能一帆風順、定將時虞顚躓已早爲海約翰與休士及其同時諸執政所鑒及、此即門戶開放政策所欲應付之障碍、今出席華會各國之政治家、旣决定中國應有完成其發展國家之必要時間、我人與之具有同意、仍準備以此作爲今後之對華政策焉、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦　史汀生致波拉之函、繼續引起此間極良好之反動、泰晤士報謂此函明白表示一九二一至二二年間在華盛頓所</p>

<p>中國之利便、彼等明白担保不利用中國之赢弱、此種自制之信條、顯然須由各國尊重、否則守約之國將受　碍、泰晤士報特别注重史汀生所發「美國之願放棄當時建造戰艦之領袖地位、及不再增築甘姆與菲律濱防禦工程、實　嚴守此九國公約」一語、謂修正該約如成爲國際事件、則美國此穏態度、秘須重加考慮、此史氏函中所以有「損及各國」之言也、日本答覆國聯之文中、謂「日本曾無保留的參與國聯會章規定之解决手續」云云、此言實使泰西人士及彼記憶日本未先照會且更少商諸國聯、遽在滿洲興兵作戰者不能索解矧近復直接違抗國聯之申請而在上海開戰乎、該報又謂日本曾允諾以九國公約之精神、談判關於滿洲與上海之最後解决、泰晤士報並堅持一九二七年英軍在滬發陸與日軍今日之登陸、性質大不相同、蓋英國此舉、專爲保護僑民計、事前曾照會國聯、且並未用租界爲作戰根據地也、東京今當嚴重注意者、戰事線延愈久、外交家與公論之趨嚮、必愈不利於日本、此非遺忘或漠視日本苦楚之根本公道、乃因有主要條約約束列强對華行動之故、不意日本今竟單獨發難、泰晤士報末謂今日時局中最足安慰人心者爲華盛頓諸條約其他簽字國决計進行在華盛頓議定之共同政策、而將繼續以權力所能爲之各種方法、輔助中國獲一有效力的與穏固的行政制度、今欲日本加入各國此項建設的工作、豈爲奢望乎云云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦孟却斯德指首導報評論史汀生致波拉之函、謂美國拒絶承認因近事變釀成之中國土地上與其他的變更、足以造成美國與國際問合作之堅固基礎、每日快報謂日本目下之地位蓄有一種警告、日本初與中國地方政府作戰、今則有與中華全國作戰之虞矣、著名出版家史悌德投函泰晤十報、謂今當有明白之表示、英國擬由拒絶接受國聯建議之各國撤回其外交代表、英國各日岸將禁止各該國之商品入口、渠意今自出此、尙不爲遲云（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>南京今午外部招待記者由亞洲司長沈覲鼎代一羅文幹談話、報告顧聯形勢如下、㈠國聯方面我國早已準備引用第十五條、希望達到國聯適用第十六條以嚴厲方法處置暴日、所以迭次會議將引用第十五條之手續、分别做去外部並已訓令顔代表、將引用十五條之手續先爲弄清、惟日方竭力反對、良以引用十五條之結論、必到十六條、至十六條能否引用在國際公正判斷上、當不致因日反對而廢、觀其依據吾代表請求三月三日開大會、即其手續之第一步、現在同題在大會中能否全體一致之同意爲斷、國人徒知提出第十六條、但第十五條之手續、應當完了、方能上第十六條之程、今十五條手續吾方已充分做到、其餘各國之準備上頗多尙未做到、須經過國聯將中日雙方報告文件審查後、國聯定出一種辦法付表决除當事國外、會員加如對此辦法一致贊成即算决定、如日本不接受、照約對於已接受辦法之國、不得從事戰爭否則會員即可斷然行經濟上之制　、萬一表决結果、除當事國外、非全體一致即不能通過、又如大會所提辦法、中國不滿意、當然亦不能引用第十六條、所以問題不是如此簡單、現在世界空氣對日公懾、尤其是各弱小國家、對大會已明白表示同情吾國、如國聯大會採取公正之辦法、各小國可全贊成、現看大國問態度如何</p>
<p>各國各有自身情形各有對外政策是否能在於吾國有利條件下來協助吾國、達到引用十六條之目的、現尙不敢說定、現本部原則上已訓令顔代表等、在十六條上審察情形相機進行矣、㈡列强態度、（甲）美國爲民主國、在人民輿論未一致前、對外不便表白態度雖對吾抱莫大之同情尙無切實方針、美邦各團體、已呈請美政府、取嚴厲方法制裁日本、私人方面、亦憤憤表示同情於我、不久美邦國內一致、或者可引起美政府作進一步之表示、最近史汀生函波拉要點明白主張門戶開放政策要各國尊重九國條約、在中日形勢嚴重之中、史氏有此表示、關係當然很大、但據個人看法、仍示免空洞、甚望再進一步爲衛護九國分約非戰公約起見、採取更切實之處置、（乙）英自由黨工黨對吾固同情、惟英民族向來穏健、不願說空話、英在華商業、尤其是長江貿易、比任何國爲大、日本不顧國際公論、　幹下去、預料英國不得已時將在國聯中作一</p>
<p>主動的地位、與美切實合作、來主張採取更切實嚴厲之處置亦未可知（丙）法國我</p>
<p>國民衆對法態度、不無有懷疑者、最近法政府一再聲明與日决無諒解、當可見信（丁）其他各國、其一部分惟大國馬首是瞻、其餘對吾同情、不成問題、㈢日本眞况、對華侵略、爲彼多年傳統政策、無論政友會民政黨當國、而對華發展是不變的不過分緩進與急進曁武力政治侵略與經濟文化侵略而已、主張武力侵略者軍閥爲主、但智識界皿想界紛紛反對、而各軍閥爲維持本身權威之存在、向來對華主張蠻幹、孰知侵犯上海屢次失敗、傷亡特多、且國內經濟非常困乏、楊子江一帶日本貿易、完全破產、國內民衆有思想者、非常不滿、如情形繼續不停其蠻幹的武力政策、不久在彼國內引起一種變化亦應有之事本來日本政治組織、在世界上是時異的、軍權與政權分立、如動員出戰、屬於軍權、則由參謀軍令兩部直接呈奏天皇批准、不經國務會議、且有不待批准而實際上已施行者、一切軍事上設施、連內閣不能預聞、此種組織、與世界和平、感甚大之威脅、而與日本自身、亦甚有害、如國民無力來推倒、將招致世界各國共同來糾正之、例如當年世界懲儆德國軍閥主義一般、現在各國尙無實行之决心、只好吾國以自力來抵抗、總之今日吾國之抵抗、不僅自衛而抵、抗且爲世界和平與維持國際公約而抵抗、此種榮譽、無論任何犧牲、亦覺値得、希望世界明瞭此次戰亂爲日本軍國主義所造成、而來協助中國、促進日本軍閥之覺悟（二十六日專電）</p>

<h3>Do Not Forget the Lessons of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 彬</h3>
<p>In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, which occurred twenty-eight years ago, we suffered a terrible defeat. This defeat determined our fate for the past twenty-eight years, a fate of being dominated and oppressed by Japan. The ceding of Taiwan and Korea, and the occupation of the Northeastern provinces last year on September 18th, all stemmed from this war.</p>
<p>The consequences of this war were particularly significant, serving as the final test of whether our nation could maintain its survival and freedom. If we were defeated in this war, our nation would fall into an even more tragic situation, from which it would never be able to recover. Therefore, our people must recognize the immense significance of this war.</p>
<p>The failure of the Sino-Japanese War was not accidental. The Qing Dynasty itself already possessed various conditions for inevitable defeat, which led to an irreversible collapse.</p>
<p>First, before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan had already made a firm decision to wage war. At that time, our ministers to Japan, Wang Fengzao, to Korea, Yuan Shikai, and to Britain and France, Gong Zhaoyuan, all reported Japan's intention to fight. The Qing government stubbornly maintained that its national strength was insufficient to engage in war, from beginning to end. It failed to prepare for war early, resulting in a hasty response and repeated defeats. Morale plummeted, leading to a downfall from which it could not recover. Second, the diplomatic situation was becoming increasingly urgent, but the Qing government remained internally divided and mutually obstructive. Li Hongzao, Weng Tonghe, and their ilk seized the opportunity to accuse Li Hongzhang of three major crimes, thwarting Li's plan to increase troop deployments. The Japanese, Mutsu Munemitsu, astutely observed that "the Qing court is committing national suicide," which was an accurate assessment. Third, once the war had begun, the entire nation should have been mobilized to fight together. However, only Li Hongzhang embraced a resolute determination to respond hastily to the war, while other provinces remained indifferent and unwilling to act. With a powerful enemy pressing from the outside and influential officials undermining from within, defeat was inevitable. Western critics after the war commented, "The Japanese were not fighting against China, but against the Beijing government. They were not fighting against the Beijing government, but against Li Hongzhang alone." From this, we can imagine the disunity and disorganization within the country at that time. Fourth, before the war began, Japan had actively prepared militarily and thoroughly arranged its diplomatic relations with various countries. It had a clear understanding of the situation, allowing it to act freely. On our side, diplomatic efforts were ineffective, uncoordinated, and sluggish. Every matter was hindered, and we were completely isolated diplomatically. Fifth, once the war had begun, we should have strived to persevere and prepare for a prolonged and arduous struggle. However, the Qing government, before it had reached a point where it could no longer fight, surrendered and sought peace, leading to the loss of sovereignty and humiliation, and resulting in twenty-eight years of oppressive control. "Only by being able to fight can we defend; only by being able to defend can we negotiate peace." Strive for victory in the last five minutes. This point is especially important for us to remember today.</p>
<p>The above five points are the reasons for the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War. They are lessons that we should revisit and seriously learn today.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Main Force Has Failed in Battle</h3>
<p>No Fierce Fighting After Yesterday Morning's Bloody Battle</p>
<p>Only Intermittent Gunfire From Various Routes</p>
<p>Dispatching Aircraft and Warships to Various Locations</p>
<p>Harassing Our Coasts and Roads</p>
<h3>Situation at Miaohang and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Enemy Remains Silent Along the Entire Line After Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Our Troops Defend the Two Towns' Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday in the Miaohang and Jiangwan areas, there was no significant contact between the two sides, only artillery exchanges. Most of the shells fired by our troops hit the enemy's rear, while the enemy continued to use massive artillery to bombard our Miaohang positions, but without causing significant damage. Only the fields around Miaohang within a mile were completely devastated by the enemy's shelling for two days and nights, with the shell craters resembling a honeycomb. Our front lines remained intact and unchanged. Our front lines in Jiangwan were located 200 yards from the racecourse. The Jiangwan Station and Jiangwan Town remained in our hands without any changes. Sentries on both sides occasionally exchanged gunfire, but there were no fierce battles.</p>
<p>The enemy was unable to recover from the heavy losses. The Japanese army, with the help of reinforcements, launched three successive general offensives from Miaohang to Jiangwan on the whole line, at approximately 2:00 PM, 6:00 PM, and 11:00 PM the day before. After being repeatedly repelled by our troops, the 11th Division, which had been moved to the front lines, suffered heavy losses, especially in Xiaochangmiao and Zhuyuan Dun, which suffered the most damage. When our troops pressed forward, they had almost lost their fighting ability. Therefore, the enemy's front lines were very quiet yesterday, suggesting that they are planning to change their strategy. From 10:25 AM yesterday, the enemy used artillery to bombard our troops fiercely. Our troops began to return fire until 11:00 AM. Enemy aircraft scouted in the sky and dropped bombs on Dachang and Miaohang. Our anti-aircraft guns fired continuously, resulting in dense artillery fire. Enemy planes also dropped bombs in Jiangwan. Enemy sentries occasionally fired at our troops with rifles, but our troops remained calm and did not respond, fearing a trap. The enemy then ceased fire, but the artillery exchanges continued unabated. Our front-line soldiers remained lying in the trenches. Because the enemy remained inactive, they did not pursue them, but consolidated their defenses. The enemy's artillery fire gradually subsided around 5:00 PM. By 11:00 PM, no battles had occurred along the various lines.</p>
<p>Enemy Front Lines at Miaohang and Jiangwan According to an officer in our army, after the enemy failed to attack Jiangwan, they changed their attack to Miaohang. The enemy troops attacking Miaohang have now been annihilated. Rumors that Miaohang is in danger and Jiangwan has fallen are false. In short, our troops are determined to fight to the death, and will resist even with only one soldier and one gun left. Currently, our defense line from Miaohang to Jiangwan remains unchanged. Jiangwan and Miaohang are still in our hands. The front lines have crossed Zhuyuan Dun, Xiaochangmiao, Mengjia Zhai, and Jinmu Zhai. The enemy's outposts are at Baiyang Zhai, Zhoujia Zhai, and Liangyin Zhai. According to other sources, the enemy has 14,000 troops east of Baiyang Zhai, and approximately 9,000 infantrymen from the 11th Division stationed north of Jiangwan Racecourse and east of Liangyin Zhai.</p>
<p>Enemy Tanks Are Completely Ineffective After the enemy used armored vehicles and tanks as tools of aggression, they suffered repeated defeats and ran into our landmines, destroying more than ten vehicles. As a result, these vehicles are now used only as artillery fortresses, surrounded by sandbags and positioned at strategic locations on the battlefield, no longer used for assaults. They are aware that they are bulky and heavy, and destroying one vehicle represents a significant loss. Therefore, in the past two days, the enemy abandoned using them in attacks on Zhuyuan Dun, Xiaochangmiao, Zhaojia Zhai, and Shuiche Tou, as the terrain there is low-lying, the soil is damp, and there are numerous ditches, which are particularly unfavorable for tanks and armored vehicles.</p>
<h3>Artillery Battles in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Repeatedly Fail in Attacks</p>
<p>Intense Artillery Fire Is Ineffective</p>
<p>In the Zhabei area, including Tiantong'an and Baziqiao, the fighting has been relatively quiet in recent days. The night before, we concentrated our artillery fire and launched a fierce attack on the enemy. The enemy stubbornly resisted from their trenches, and fierce battles raged. By dawn yesterday, the enemy could no longer withstand the pressure and retreated. Our troops did not pursue them, except to advance the front lines. At 5:00 PM, the enemy launched a counterattack, but with a small number of troops, only using artillery fire. Our troops also retaliated with heavy artillery. Fierce battles lasted for about an hour. The enemy, suffering setbacks in their attack, retreated and did not dare to charge again. From 8:30 PM, the enemy again used heavy artillery to bombard our front lines, intermittently for several hours, without any success. Intermittent artillery fire was still heard around midnight this morning.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from the 26th at 3:00 AM, received by the Central News Agency, reported that Chinese troops in Zhabei began a fierce artillery bombardment of Japanese defense lines this morning. The artillery fire has been ongoing for an hour. A fire broke out in a certain location within the Japanese defense lines and is still burning. It is expected that the Chinese troops will take advantage of the night to launch an attack on the Japanese, as most of the Japanese troops in Zhabei have been transferred to Jiangwan, leaving the defenses weak. Chinese troops have not yet shelled the Japanese consulate or the Japanese flagship.</p>

<h3>Situation at Wusong</h3>
<p>Enemy Warships Take Turns Firing</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Drop Bombs Randomly</p>
<p>Causing No Damage to Our Troops</p>
<p>In the Wusong fortress area, enemy warships had launched artillery attacks on us several times the day before. Yesterday morning, more than ten enemy warships were anchored outside Tianjia Shui and did not open fire. However, at high tide in the afternoon, three warships took turns firing at us and stopped when the tide receded. In the Yunzaobang area, including Houjia Muqiao and Jijia Qiao, the enemy troops attacked our positions yesterday morning. At the same time, six enemy aircraft dropped bombs to assist in the attack. Our troops remained steadfast in their defense without any changes. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy warships attack at high tide, entering the waters outside Sanjia Shui. More than ten enemy warships are currently anchored there, far from the range of the artillery. Yesterday, these enemy warships did not attack the fortresses, but sent three enemy warships to Wusong Town to take turns firing whenever there was a full tide. As soon as the tide receded, they retreated outside the port. There are no enemy warships in the Pu River near Zhang Huabang. According to soldiers who arrived in Shanghai from Wusong yesterday, since 8:00 AM the day before (the 25th), thirteen or fourteen Japanese warships anchored in the waters of Sanjia Shui had been frequently bombarding the area with artillery until yesterday morning. Airplanes also randomly dropped bombs. Our troops were all lying in the trenches, waiting for them to approach before retaliating. In reality, our military suffered no losses, but the civilian houses and shops were reduced to rubble, with not a single one intact. Most of the shells came from outside the port, and a small number came from inside the Pu River, from the anchored enemy warships. Yesterday, one enemy transport ship carried about a thousand enemy troops and attempted to land northeast of Zhang Huabang, but was repelled by the defending soldiers, with at least fifty or sixty casualties.</p>
<p>The enemy attacked Sitang River yesterday morning in the Wusong Yunzaobang area. The two armies remain confronting each other across the river without contact. In the Houjia Muqiao and Jijia Qiao areas along the Nan Sitang River, the enemy suddenly dispatched heavy troops at around 8:00 AM yesterday to attack our positions. At the same time, six enemy aircraft dropped bombs to assist in the attack. Our troops have built strong trenches in that area and are adequately equipped with troops, so they are able to cope with the enemy's intense artillery fire. The enemy positions near Zhang Huabang are not as quiet as they have been in recent days. The enemy soldiers are extremely busy, transporting military supplies to the front lines in groups of two or three via the Songhu Railway. At around 9:00 AM, a small steamer towed three barges loaded with over 400 enemy soldiers and a large amount of military supplies from Shanghai to the Liangmi Wharf. After the enemy soldiers landed, they were transferred to the front lines. After the fighting began in that area, it intensified throughout the afternoon. As of 3:00 PM, the two sides were still in a stalemate.</p>
<p>A large number of enemy aircraft dropped bombs. According to another report, at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, thirteen enemy aircraft, including seven bombers and six reconnaissance planes, flew from the Wusong aircraft carrier and dropped several bombs on the area around Wusong Wai Ma Lu. The high-rise building of the Ningshang Fire Brigade was hit and destroyed by the bombs, and the Haibin Hospital was also affected. Our troops opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, and six planes were seen flying to the northwest, and seven to the Jiangwan area. After 8:00 AM, Japanese warships fired more than ten shells, all of which landed in the fields near the Artillery Taiwan Lion Bridge. Also, at 1:00 PM yesterday, a team of three Japanese aircraft dropped incendiary bombs in the Yunzaobang area. A fire soon broke out and was extinguished at 3:00 PM because no one was there to put it out.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Arrive at Bailonggang</h3>
<p>Bombarding Civilians on Our Shores</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Strafing Farmers</p>
<p>Yesterday, two enemy warships arrived at Bailonggang in Chuansha, along with another warship from Lao Hongwa, and frequently opened fire to bombard civilians on our shores. Also, at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, several enemy aircraft flew in and used machine guns to strafe farmers on the ground, but our troops were prepared and did not suffer any damage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Shell Zhapu</h3>
<p>Assisted by Aircraft</p>
<p>But All Attempts Failed</p>
<p>Three Japanese warships anchored at Zhapu Port near Pinghu, Zhejiang, suddenly opened fire on our garrison with more than ten shells at around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The landing party on the warships attempted to take advantage of the situation to land, but were unsuccessful due to our troops' tight defenses. Yesterday morning, five Japanese aircraft reconnoitered the Zhapu port area, followed by eleven more aircraft, which reconnoitered for several minutes before leaving.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Flew to Hangzhou Yesterday Morning and Engaged in Fierce Air Battles with Our Air Force</h3>
<p>Fifteen Enemy Aircraft Dropped Bombs on Jianqiao Our Ten Aircraft Immediately Took Off to Engage</p>
<p>The Enemy Aircraft Retreated After Ten Minutes of Engagement</p>
<p>Our Four Aircraft Sustained Minor Damage and Two Crew Members Were Slightly Injured</p>
<p>At 6:30 AM yesterday morning, the enemy dispatched fifteen aircraft to the Jianqiao airfield in Hangzhou and dropped heavy bombs. Because our side had not received prior notice, only ten aircraft were able to take off to engage at the time. The disparity in numbers was significant, so we suffered slight losses. The details are described below:</p>
<p>According to news obtained in this city, at 6:30 AM yesterday morning, fifteen Japanese fighter planes took off from Gaoqiao and flew to Jianqiao via a detour over the sea, circling in the air and attempting to bomb our airfield. At that time, there were thirteen aircraft parked at our airfield, and ten of them immediately took off to engage. The remaining three were bombed and slightly damaged as they were unable to take off in time. The Japanese planes dropped more than ten bombs (all heavy bombs). A thatched hut opposite the station was also destroyed by the bombing. The station staff were extremely alarmed, but the station was fortunately spared. When our aircraft were fighting the Japanese aircraft in the air, our garrison also used anti-aircraft guns to fire on them. The Japanese aircraft were no match and fled. At around noon, three more Japanese aircraft flew along the Huhang Railway to the area of Genshanmen and inspected the area in the air for tens of minutes before flying to the Wengjia Slope opposite Linping Station, circling for a week, but fortunately did not drop any bombs. However, many Japanese aircraft later flew over Jianqiao, Changan, and Xiashi until 6:00 PM, when they flew back to Gaoqiao.</p>
<p>According to a special dispatch from our Hangzhou correspondent, Japanese aircraft flew to Hangzhou from Shanghai along the railway line, in five teams of fifteen planes in total. They dropped bombs on Jianqiao, which landed in an open field. One bomb exploded. Our planes flew to intercept them, and the Japanese aircraft fled. They returned again in the afternoon, flew over the city station, circled, and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th reported that the Aviation Department issued the following press release regarding the air battle in Hangzhou this morning: "After dawn this morning, fifteen Japanese aircraft, including three bombers and twelve fighters, suddenly flew to Hangzhou. Ten Chinese aircraft immediately engaged them. Many other aircraft were unable to take off, and the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs, damaging three Chinese training aircraft and one transport aircraft, but the damage was minimal and can be repaired soon. When the twelve Japanese fighters engaged our aircraft, the three Japanese bombers fled. The battle lasted only ten minutes, and the Japanese fighters also fled to Shanghai. Two of our pilots sustained minor injuries. One enemy aircraft crashed near Hangzhou Bay. The fuselage was destroyed and the pilot was killed."</p>
<h3>The Enemy Abandoned Bombing Tactics</h3>
<p>Planning to Switch to Machine Gun Assaults</p>
<p>Which Our Long-Fighting Soldiers Do Not Fear</p>
<p>The enemy has been using heavy artillery and aircraft to bomb our troops, but the result, apart from harming civilians, has not changed our front lines at all. It is reported that the enemy, having failed repeatedly, will abandon bombing tactics and switch to machine gun assaults, but our troops are all long-fighting soldiers, and the enemy will definitely not succeed.</p>
<h3>Civilian Boats Equipped with Motors</h3>
<p>Another Deceptive Tactic by the Japanese Army</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, I walked to the Bund. A steamboat was docked there, and I knew the manager of the boat. After a conversation, I asked him to sail along the Huangpu River once for inspection purposes. He agreed, and we immediately set sail towards the mouth of the Wusong River. I saw that along the Huangpu River, warships of various countries were lined up, and the number of ships coming and going was not as large as before. When passing the Huishan Wharf and approaching the Huangpu Wharf, I suddenly saw more than thirty civilian boats (without cabins, commonly known as beach boats) docked along the wharf, which was quite strange. I asked the helmsman of the boat to go closer to the shore. Upon approaching, I saw countless Koreans installing motors (machines) at the rear of each boat, converting them into steamboats. Two boats had already been completed and were being test-sailed in the Huangpu River. Each boat had twenty or thirty people from Jiangbei on board, seemingly testing the boat's load and speed. Seeing this, I thought to myself that the enemy must be planning another stealth landing or perhaps some other new military plan. I quickly bid farewell. Upon returning, I saw enemy soldiers disembarking from those boats, suggesting that the enemy will implement their plan tonight or early this morning.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Shot Down Two Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Flew to Zhenru Last Night and Dropped Bombs, Resulting in No Damage to Our Side Enemy Armored Vehicle Destroyed by Our Garrison in Zhabei (Photo by Li Ziyang)</p>
<p>At around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, three enemy aircraft flew from the east to reconnoiter the Zhabei area, dropping bombs in the areas of Gonghe Xin Road and Jiaotong Road, killing several people and destroying many civilian houses on the spot. At around 5:00 PM, they flew to Zhenru and also dropped bombs, intending to disrupt our rear. At around 9:00 PM last night, enemy aircraft again dropped bombs near the Zhenru Radio Station, but caused no damage. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Many Killed in Zhabei Two Japanese aircraft have been soaring and circling in the Zhabei sky since 1:50 PM yesterday afternoon, and then dropped seven or eight explosive bombs in Gonghe Xin Road, Zhongxing Road, Jiaotong Road, and Tanziwan, killing many men, women, old, and young, which is truly inhumane. The affected areas are recorded as follows: 1) Five bombs in Gonghe Xin Road, destroying more than ten tiled houses, killing five members of the family of Li Jinzhang, a coolie from Yancheng, including men, women, and children; 2) Three bombs in Zhongxing Road, destroying five thatched houses; 3) More than ten bombs west of Taiyang Temple Road and Datong Road, destroying more than ten thatched sheds in Jiangbei, killing and injuring many coolies and men, women, and children; 4) Enemy aircraft also flew over and dropped bombs on the roof of the Third Civilian Residence of the municipal government in Jiaotong Road and Tanziwan. When the aircraft dropped bombs, our military authorities, fearing damage to the residents, immediately sent people to various locations to advise them to evacuate, so many people helped the old and young, dragging boxes and carrying baskets, and fled westward along Jiaotong Road. After 5:00 PM, traffic was cut off and pedestrians were not allowed to pass, leaving the roads completely empty.</p>
<p>Bombs Dropped in Zhenru at Night At around 9:00 PM last night, several enemy aircraft flew to the vicinity of Zhenru and dropped bombs, intending to destroy it. They flew away after about ten minutes. This was the first time enemy aircraft had bombed at night, but there were no damages. Also, at around 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, three enemy aircraft dropped more than ten bombs three miles west of Zhenru, destroying more than ten civilian houses.</p>
<p>Two Enemy Aircraft Shot Down In the Miaohang Town area, many enemy aircraft flew over yesterday morning, circling for a moment to reconnoiter our defense lines, and then flew southeast. After 11:00 AM, eight more enemy aircraft flew in and dropped many bombs on the Miaohang Town defense lines and rear. Our troops fired with high-angle guns, etc., because the enemy aircraft's purpose was to carry out destruction. As a result, at 11:30 AM, we shot down one enemy aircraft. Also, according to a visitor from Dachang, at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, three enemy aircraft flew from the southwest towards Dachang, dropping two incendiary bombs, which exploded after falling, causing no harm. At the same time, our troops used rifles and steel cannons to target and shoot down the enemy aircraft, which crashed in the fields northeast of the Yuqing Bridge on the Huta Highway.</p>
<h3>Important Military News from the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army's Front Lines are Far from Solid. The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that, according to military observers, the Japanese army's front lines are far from solid. They rely entirely on intense artillery fire to contain the Chinese army's counterattacks. The Japanese army seems to have little in the way of reserve troops, or perhaps none at all. Therefore, they can only advance slowly each day to maintain their positions.</p>
<p>The Japanese Eagerly Await Reinforcements. The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that news from Tokyo indicates the Ministry of the Army has decided to send the 11th Division and the 14th Division to Shanghai to assist the 9th Division, the 25th Brigade, and the Naval Landing Force. The Japanese military authorities in Shanghai are constantly hoping for reinforcements to arrive. They have already consulted the Shanghai Pilots Association to prepare a number of pilots to guide troop transport ships into the Woosung port. Sixteen foreign pilots have been hired and are awaiting orders. The news of reinforcements heading to Shanghai came out on Wednesday. The Japanese side is keeping this matter strictly secret, only saying that they are unlikely to arrive tonight or tomorrow.</p>
<p>No Japanese Soldiers Arrived Yesterday. The Japanese army in Shanghai has repeatedly suffered defeats, with heavy casualties among officers and soldiers and even greater losses of military supplies. Since the 24th, Japan has been sending the 11th Division to Shanghai for assistance, arriving in two installments and already joining the front lines. It is estimated that the total number of Japanese troops arriving in Shanghai is three divisions, one brigade, and 6,200 naval landing forces. Now, no more can be spared, so no Japanese reinforcements arrived yesterday, and no Japanese warships were seen. However, it is reported that a batch of Japanese soldiers already en route is expected to arrive today.</p>
<p>The Japanese Hire a Large Number of White Russians in Shanghai. Since the start of the fighting, the Japanese army has mostly used Jiangbei traitors for tasks such as digging trenches, transporting ammunition, and harassing our rear. Recently, due to repeated defeats, the Japanese army has often become angry and slaughtered the Jiangbei people they hired, dumping their bodies in the Huangpu River. Most of the Jiangbei people who were coerced into service have also secretly escaped. The Japanese army then sent telegrams to the Northeast, hiring a large number of White Russians in Changchun, Dalian, and Harbin to come to Shanghai and provide military service both at the front and in the rear. The first batch of 400-500 White Russians hired by the Japanese army in the Northeast was transported to Dalian Bay and then sailed to Shanghai on the "Changchun Maru" steamship of the Dalian Steamship Company, arriving at the port at 2:20 PM yesterday and landing at the Huangpu Wharf at 3:50 PM. This group of White Russians was dressed in tattered civilian clothes and was led by Japanese officers as soon as they disembarked, to be assigned to various military tasks.</p>
<p>Japan Has a Total of 200 Aircraft. The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that, according to investigations, the Japanese aircraft participating in the Shanghai battles now account for about half of Japan's naval air combat strength. It is estimated that there are about 200 Japanese aircraft in Shanghai, including 130 belonging to the two aircraft carriers stationed at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The Japanese navy has a total of four aircraft carriers. Since the arrival of Ueteda's 9th Division in Shanghai, many more army aircraft have been added. The Japanese commander has been using naval and army aircraft for attacks every day, because the combat strength of the infantry is weak and unreliable.</p>
<p>The Enemy Procures Large Quantities of Grain. After the arrival of the Japanese army in Shanghai, the demand for food is very large. Initially, it was shipped from Japan, then changed to being transported from Dalian. Now, due to the large number of troops and the shortage of supplies, it is not enough. Therefore, the Japanese have entrusted Yangtze River steamers to go to various ports along the Yangtze River, using traitors under Japanese protection to procure supplies in Wuhu, Jiujiang and other places. Yesterday, the Japanese steamer "Yueyang Maru" left Shanghai for the Yangtze River, ostensibly for commercial purposes, but in reality, it was carrying military supplies to Hankou and purchasing grain and vegetables for the Japanese soldiers in Shanghai. The Chinese people should pay attention to this. Over 10,000 Japanese Residents Return Home. The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, according to Japanese estimates, more than 15,000 Japanese residents from Shanghai and other parts of China have returned to Japan. Among them, 11,000 are from Shanghai. Now, only 14,000 remain in Shanghai. Most of the Japanese residents returning to Japan are women and children, accounting for about 80%. The men are mostly elderly or unemployed due to the war.</p>
<p>Rushing to Make Thin Coffins to Enshroud Officer Corpses. Since the beginning of the war in Shanghai, an increasing number of Japanese army officers have been killed in action and must be transported back to Japan. Therefore, four Chinese carpenters are being forced to work day and night at the Zhongshan Automobile Company and the Dalong Automobile Company, which have been relocated to the Kunshan Garden on Zha Pu Road, rushing to make white-wrapped, thin-skinned coffins to transport the bodies of officers from the front lines back to their homeland. They are required to produce more than ten coffins every day and night. Burning Soldiers' Corpses at the Yue Naijia Garden. Almost a month has passed since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, and there have been countless deaths and injuries. Initially, soldiers' corpses could be calmly put into sacks and transported back to Japan. However, since the general offensive on the 20th of this month, over 3,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed and over 6,000 have been injured. If the soldiers' corpses are transported from the front lines to the Wayside Wharf, they must pass through the Wusong Road area, which may cause panic among the Japanese soldiers. Moreover, sending them back to Japan may cause discontent in the country. Therefore, since the 25th, the corpses have been burned nearby at the Yue Naijia Garden on Dixiwei Road. It is reported that over 1,000 corpses have been burned since the 25th, and the burning is still continuing.</p>
<p>The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" Newspaper Office Hit by a Shell. The night before last, more than ten shells hit the area around Wusong Road and Zha Pu Road in Hongkou. The Japanese-language newspaper "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" was hit by a shell at 11:55 PM the night before last. The shell penetrated the roof of the third floor and landed on the floor of the second floor, but it did not explode, which can be said to be a narrow escape.</p>
<p>The Enemy to Employ Nail-Studded Boards. Our military authorities received a report yesterday stating that the Japanese ship "Dalian Maru" was loaded with a large number of wooden boxes at Wayside Wharf, filled with sharp iron nails. The enemy plans to use "nail-studded boards," setting them up in front of their positions to prevent our infantry from charging. The ship also carried over two hundred army soldiers, who disembarked at Wayside Wharf.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Members Going to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Whether Sun Ke Will Go is Undecided</p>
<p>Over ten members of the Central Committee, including Gan Naiguang, Xue Dubi, Kong Xiangxi, Yang Hu, Zhang Dingfan, Fu Rulin, and Ma Chaojun, reported to the Shanghai office yesterday morning. They will travel together to Luoyang in a day or two to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees. However, whether Sun Ke will go is still undecided.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Prepares to Recover Lost Territory</h3>
<p>Said to Have Specific Plans</p>
<p>Actively Working to Atonement for Past Mistakes</p>
<p>The Central Committee members stationed in Shanghai telegraphed Zhang Xueliang on the 20th of this month, urging him to recover the lost territory in the Northeast and make amends for his mistakes. It is now learned that Zhang replied to a certain Central Committee member in Shanghai yesterday from Beiping, stating, "Your telegram is respectfully acknowledged. I feel deeply guilty for the loss of the Northeast. I have now instructed all units to prepare everything to jointly face the national crisis and recover the lost territory. Specific plans have been made and are being actively implemented to atone for past mistakes. I respectfully reply to inform you," and so on.</p>
<h3>Gu Dinghua's War Report</h3>
<p>Gu Dinghua's Telegram to Minister Song: Minister Song Jun, I am sending this confidential report.</p>
<p>(1) Around 9:00 AM today, the enemy launched a fierce attack with heavy artillery, aircraft, tanks, and other vehicles. Our officers and soldiers fought calmly and eventually repelled the enemy, leaving behind a trail of bodies. (2) The Second and Third Battalions are engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Although the enemy's forces are strong, I am determined to resist to the end, even if only one bullet and one soldier remain. Gu Dinghua, respectfully on [the] 25th.</p>

<h3>Xiong Xiling's Telegram to Comfort the Families of Soldiers Who Died Defending the Nation</h3>
<p>Xiong Xiling's telegram to the commanders of the 19th Route Army: To Commanders Jiang, Cai, and Dai of the 19th Route Army in Shanghai, your army's officers and soldiers, defending the country's territory and fighting for the nation's dignity, bravely fought the enemy and sacrificed their lives. I deeply admire them. Xiling is now telegraphing General Zhu Ziqiao and other gentlemen, planning to gather social resources to discuss ways to comfort the families of the deceased. We will find ways to take care of the parents, siblings, wives, and children of the martyred soldiers who are unable to support themselves. The children who have no parents will be taken into orphanages and other charitable institutions to be educated and raised, to comfort the loyal souls and encourage the soldiers. Please inform the soldiers at the front that the comfort of their parents, siblings, wives, and children is the responsibility of the survivors. They can rest assured and close their eyes in peace. Please instruct the military scribes to keep a record of the surnames, names, and addresses of the fallen soldiers and show them to us at any time. I am endlessly grateful. Xiong Xiling, Dean of the Xiangshan Children's Home in Beiping, salutes you truly.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yuejun's Telegram Appealing to Provinces to Donate Funds</h3>
<p>Please Comfort the Soldiers and Relieve the Shanghai Disaster</p>
<p>Funds to Be Handed Over to the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, the areas of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong have been bombed by the enemy, causing residents to be displaced and die, and the disaster is extremely severe. Our brave soldiers are resisting heroically and should also be comforted. Former Mayor Zhang Yuejun and his wife telegraphed military and political leaders of various provinces the day before yesterday, requesting them to donate funds to comfort the Shanghai army and relieve the disaster-stricken people. The telegram is recorded below: (Titles omitted) Since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, almost a month has passed. Our three million citizens of Shanghai are living in smoke and bullets every day. The dead are torn to pieces, a tragic sight. The living are displaced, a painful situation. Our brave soldiers, adhering to their duty to defend the territory and with the sincere intention of serving the country, have risen up to defend themselves and have repeatedly defeated the violent enemy. They are all united against the enemy, regarding death as going home. When the troops are upright, they are strong; when the soldiers are aggrieved, they will win. The situation is bound to happen, and the reason is natural. I once led Shanghai City and discussed with people from all walks of life on how to defend ourselves and work together to resist the enemy. Now, although I have retired as a citizen, I am even more heartbroken to see this tragic situation. The enemy is increasing the number of troops and does not regret the disaster. We should strengthen our own defenses and make long-term preparations. Although Shanghai is a corner, it is related to the whole country. Speaking of Shanghai, relieving the refugees and comforting the soldiers are the most urgent tasks today. Whenever there are natural disasters and man-made disasters in the country, the people of Shanghai have always exhausted their efforts to donate. Now, unfortunately, we have suffered this strange disaster of artillery fire. We also hope that people across the country will lend a helping hand. I humbly implore you to make a call and vigorously solicit donations. If you raise a substantial amount of money and remit it to the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association for distribution, it will not only boost morale and inspire soldiers, but also protect the whole country by protecting Shanghai City. This telegram is urgent. Please consider it. Zhang Qun and Ma Yuying salute you. Zhang also sent a letter to the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association, requesting that any funds remitted from various places be received and replied to directly. He also learned that many places have already replied, promising to raise funds immediately and remit them to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Actions of Friendly Foreign Diplomats During the War</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency received a Reuters report on the 25th: (1) Tonight, the German Consul-General and his staff moved out of the consulate completely because the German consulate was too close to the Japanese consulate, and the Japanese consulate and flagship were targets of Chinese artillery fire. At the same time, the American Consul-General also warned the American residents staying at the Cathay Hotel to evacuate completely to avoid danger. The British consulate is also nearby, but it is separated by the Suzhou Creek, and British Ambassador Lampson and the British and German consuls have become accustomed to the sound of gunfire and do not mind it. (2) British Ambassador Lampson visited various hospitals today to inspect the wounded Chinese soldiers and was deeply moved. Lampson told people that most of the wounded Chinese soldiers were injured by bombs, not bullets.</p>
<h3>Condolence Messages</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Continue to Remit Over 40,000 Taels. A telegram from Nanjing on the 26th states that the government has received a steady stream of military funds from overseas Chinese. Today, it received 20,000 yuan from Burma, 6,000 yuan from Canada, and 20,000 taels from Vietnam.</p>

<p>Longhai Railway Donates 5,000 Gold Yuan. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng forwards to the headquarters of the 19th Route Army, Commander-in-Chief Jiang, and all the officers and soldiers: The Songhu war continues and is an occasion for China to release steam after the Sino-Japanese War. Not only has the enemy's courage been diminished, but the world's attention has also been shaken. The colleagues of this railway are inspired by the victories and respectfully donate 5,000 yuan, which will be remitted by the Bank of China, to express their condolences. We hope you will accept and distribute it, and we hope that you will fight to the end to strive for the final victory. All employees of the Longhai Railway salute you.</p>
<p>Donations from Chinese in Little Luzon. The Chinese National Salvation Association in Little Luzon telegraphed Mayor Wu of Shanghai, Wu Tiecheng, to be forwarded to Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, and all the generals and officers: The violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, and fortunately, your army was loyal to the country, bravely defended the country, and bravely killed the enemy. The good news is frequently reported, and China and foreign countries are grateful. Overseas Chinese vow to be the rearguard and only hope that you will continue to work hard to defeat the Japanese pirates. Now, we are remitting 2,000 yuan in Shanghai silver through the China Transportation Company. Please receive the money and reply.</p>
<p>News of Fund Raising in Singapore. Former President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Lin Yishun, has returned to China to recuperate and is residing in Shanghai. This time, the Japanese army invaded the country, and seeing the displaced people in distress, he urgently telegraphed various ports in Nanyang to appeal for relief. Overseas Chinese compatriots have sent remittances one after another after receiving the telegram. Recently, Mr. Lin received a letter from Mr. Li Juncheng, the current president of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, stating that the chamber has launched the organization of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and established the Refugee Relief Committee, and designated the Shanghai Banking Association and the General Manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Li Ming, to receive and distribute the relief funds. With such a large-scale fundraising campaign, overseas Chinese compatriots are inherently enthusiastic and patriotic, so they will definitely donate generously, and a large amount of money will come. During the Jinan Massacre that year, Singapore raised a huge amount of over 2 million yuan. It is thought that considering the relationship between the survival of the country at this moment, the results of the fundraising should not be mentioned.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Groaning and Lacking Bedding. In recent days, the number of wounded soldiers in the front line has been increasing, and the rear hospitals everywhere are extremely busy. Although the number of beds can barely be met, there is a great lack of bedding, so the armed comrades who are injured for the country are groaning in bed, without bedding or other items to cover them, and they are in great pain. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will quickly donate bedding to the Relief Division of the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association on the second floor of 66 Sichuan Road, so that it can be transferred to various hospitals for immediate use. We are extremely eager.</p>
<p>All-Day Business at Da Hu to Help Military Expenses. Yesterday, Da Hu Ballroom at 126 Jing'an Temple Road sent the proceeds from its all-day business to the front lines through the Shanghai Banking Association to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers. The amount consisted of 514 yuan in big money, 10 yuan and 4 jiao in small money, 24 jiao in small foreign money, and 3 yuan and 5 jiao in big money and 60 jiao in small foreign money from the cloakroom.

They also sent over a thousand hemp bags donated by the Victory Association to the rear office of the 19th Route Army a few days ago.</p>
<p>Newsboy Accumulates Money to Help Military Expenses. Editor, my home is located under Qingyun Bridge in Zhabei. There are eight people in my family. I used to study at Qingyun Bridge Elementary School. From January 28th, the fierce Japanese army rushed into Zhabei and massacred my people. My sister and my brother were also killed at that time. Later, my father led us to escape to the concession. I used to be a student at school, but now I am using this time off from school to sell your newspaper, accumulating the surplus profit from selling newspapers every day. I have now accumulated 20 jiao in small foreign money and 4,400 copper coins. I now implore you to send this money to the front to fulfill my duty as a citizen, and I hope that you will publish this letter in your newspaper so that everyone can save money by economizing on food and clothing and send it to the front or to refugee camps to help the refugees. It's getting late when I write this letter, and I have to go to the street to sell newspapers. I can't write any more now. I wish you good health, Editor. Wang Quanlu, a newspaper seller, salutes you on February 25th.</p>

<p>National Salvation Associations Donate Steel Bulletproof Vests. The 88th Division of the National Army, led by Yu Jishi, participated in the anti-Japanese war this time, and they were very brave. In the Battle of Miaohang the day before yesterday, they defeated a large number of Japanese troops with a small number of soldiers, and the enemy was frightened by it. Various group national salvation federations specially purchased 40 American steel bulletproof vests, 800 compasses, and 30 large bundles of sugar cane from Yin Zhiling, Bi Zibai, Wu Ruiyuan, Zhu Lian'en, Sheng Xiaoxian, Cheng Houkun, Kui Lin, and Mao Hongsheng. They were personally sent to the front by Mr. Yin and others yesterday (the 26th) to express their condolences. Division Commander Yu represented the division and expressed his gratitude, saying that all the soldiers are determined to kill the enemy with all their might to repay their compatriots.</p>
<p>Condolences from the Yangzhou Native Place Association. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Yangzhou Eight Counties Native Place Association held an emergency meeting, with 32 committee members attending.

<h3>Relief Work</h3>
<p>The Divisional Headquarters urgently needs relief medicines. The 88th Division is currently lacking medical supplies. Wounded soldiers at the front lines are suffering from a lack of medicine for treatment. People from all walks of life, if they have medicines to donate for military use, can send them to the 88th Division's garrison office in Nanxiang or Suzhou for forwarding to the front lines for use.</p>
<p>Lu Bohong Adds a Wounded Soldier Hospital. Lu Bohong, president of the Catholic Action Association of this city and philanthropist, has personally visited various hospitals daily to comfort wounded soldiers since the start of the war, sparing no effort. In addition to converting a portion of the Xin Pu Yu Tang into the Red Cross's 16th Wounded Soldier Hospital, taking on the role of director himself, he yesterday discussed with Zhang Bingbiao, the housekeeper priest of the Dongjiadu Catholic Church in the South City, to set up the 30th Wounded Soldier Hospital using a portion of the Catholic Church's buildings and the Catholic Action Association's clubhouse. Everything has been arranged. The director is Zhang Bingbiao, the deputy director and chief of general affairs is Lu Yingeng, and the medical directors are doctors Sun Kuifang, Zhang Youmei, Ma Shijing, Xu Yuanfu, and Luo Zehong. The general secretaries are Zhu Zuoting, Dong Junfu, Lu Zhonglin, and Shen Songbai, among others, all enthusiastically serving. The hospital currently has more than 150 wounded soldiers, but is lacking cash, medicine, equipment, bedding, short shirts and pants, etc. It is hoped that enthusiastic men and women and慰勞团體（慰劳团体的具体含义需要根据历史背景判断，暂时保留原文）will provide assistance.</p>

<p>Zhu Maocheng and Others Enthusiastically Provide Relief. The wounded soldier relief team initiated by Zhu Maocheng, Chen Liting, Yang Suolan, Jin Guozhen, etc., in this city, organized as the 16th detachment of the Red Cross relief team, has been reported in previous newspapers. Since its establishment, the team has been working diligently for nearly twenty days. The team members have all been working selflessly, personally going to the front lines to rescue wounded soldiers. Recently, due to the intensity of the war and the stressful work, they plan to increase the number of team members and expand the scope. New team member training began on the 26th. Previously, the Madi Automobile Company donated a truck, but it was still insufficient. Recently, Hu Yongqi, Sun Meitang, Zhang Shenzhi, and Chen Zhonggao enthusiastically assisted in obtaining two trucks from the Ningbo Association, which greatly facilitated the work. Various groups, because the team members are serving enthusiastically, risking their lives in the midst of gunfire to rescue people, are willing to provide support. Recently, Mr. Lin Kanghou raised 1,000 yuan, the Renshe Relief Committee donated 500 yuan, and the Sincere Company donated 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Ding Mengxing Runs a Wounded Soldier Hospital. Ding Mengxing, a prominent businessman in this city, deeply admires the soldiers of the 19th Route Army for their bravery in fighting the enemy and repeatedly achieving great feats. He recently sent Chen Dafang to purchase慰劳品（慰劳品的具体含义需要根据历史背景判断，暂时保留原文）to send to the front lines to express his respect. Because the war has been prolonged, the treatment of wounded soldiers is of great importance, so Mr. Ding discussed setting up a wounded soldier hospital. The new hospital is located at No. 10 to 12 Zhangjiabang, Mayback Road, a four-story western-style building. The place is spacious and can accommodate hundreds of people. The air is clean and the layout is very well-arranged. Mr. Ding also obtained the support of Dr. Tan Yili, a medical doctor representing the World Sports Association, to preside over the hospital's medical affairs and also provides more than 1,000 yuan in monthly funding. His enthusiasm is truly commendable. It is reported that the hospital's operating room is fully equipped and the medicines are all of the highest quality, so that the wounded officers and soldiers who defend the country can receive good treatment. The hospital (on the 24th) has been fully arranged and has begun to accommodate dozens of wounded soldiers. Mr. Ding is still worried that the equipment may be inadequate and plans to invite Commander-in-Chief Jiang and Commander Cai to send personnel to guide everything in person.</p>
<p>The 29th Wounded Soldier Hospital is Canceled. The Sacred Heart Hospital in Yangshupu was recently borrowed by the Chinese Red Cross as the 29th Wounded Soldier Hospital and should also treat Japanese wounded soldiers according to the charter of the International Red Cross, etc. Currently, due to various difficulties, the hospital director, Mr. Lu, replied to the Red Cross by letter that the plan had been canceled.</p>
<p>The Relief of Catholic Believers in Shanghai. The Shanghai Catholic Believers' Relief Association, led by Jiang Yuesun, Hu Fangjin, Zhang Xianting, Li Wende, Hu Guocheng, Hu Guo [blank], Shen Bokang, etc., initiated and organized its first shelter for women and children at No. 2 Yong [blank] Road, Rue Cardinal Mercier. The performance is considered well-organized. In addition, they spare no effort in rescuing wounded soldiers and sending away refugees. Recently, the first shelter is nearly full and those seeking refuge are still coming in an endless stream, so there is an urgent need to expand. Therefore, they are soliciting donations from believers and seeking assistance from all sectors to increase the strength of relief efforts. Bishop Hui, in view of the enthusiasm of the believers in the church, recently issued a handwritten instruction to inform the believers that they should follow the Lord's purpose of loving people and strive to rescue the wounded and those in distress. The association's offices are: (1) the cashier's office of the Yangjingbang Catholic Church in the French Concession, and (2) Junyi Company, No. 1 Xieping Lane, corner of Avenue Baille and Avenue Joffre.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Traffic on the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Feng Yi, the captain of the 6th squadron of the Suzhou Creek Police, was ordered by the 19th Route Army to cut off water traffic and expel all kinds of boats from the Lao Laji Bridge onward, due to Japanese plainclothes teams disguising themselves, going to the rear to throw bombs, and setting fires to disrupt the rear. Since its implementation the day before yesterday, although quite cautious, the Zhabei people were even more panicked. Therefore, the military and political authorities, in view of this, ordered Captain Feng to restore the traffic immediately and dispatched more police officers to strictly inspect the people coming and going, and allowed them to pass if they were suspicious. Yesterday, the residents of Zhabei were able to cross to the concession as usual.</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude Towards the War in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Circles' Thoughts on the Shanghai Incident. Kinoshita Tosaku, editorial advisor of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, and Nishimura Makoto, business director, were dispatched to Shanghai to慰问日侨日军（慰问日侨日军的具体含义需要根据历史背景判断，暂时保留原文）. En route via Dalian, regarding his impressions of the inspection, he expressed his opinion to the Manchuria Daily News as follows: After the Shanghai Incident, the military strongly advocated a military solution, but there was a saying on our army (Japanese army) that "killing is a sword of life." Therefore, in an instant, the great key to life and death was determined. Moreover, at the beginning of the incident, foreigners believed in Japan's intentions and criticized the military's planned plan. This kind of news and news articles have spread all over the world, so it is of great importance to Japan's national fortune. In addition, Shanghai is a major commercial port in the world. In the future, Japan's commercial negotiations in Shanghai will cause great losses to the Japanese business community due to this incident. Therefore, I hope that our army will carefully take military action.</p>
<p>The Japanese Military Advocates a Quick Victory. The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo said that the military believes that the final ultimatum issued by our side (Japan) was rebuffed by China, and knows that the war is unavoidable. Therefore, at the meeting of military councilors, the attitude was quite tough, but fearing that the war would be prolonged, which would be detrimental, they all advocated a quick victory and urged the heads of the naval and army departments to implement it.</p>
<h3>Statement by Finance Minister Soong</h3>
<p>A Declaration for Bondholders</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen issued a statement yesterday, saying, "Since last year, our country has suffered unprecedented floods. The whole country has been busy with disaster relief, and the Liaoning Incident has taken advantage of it. Tax revenues have suddenly become弩末（弩末的具体含义需要根据历史背景判断，暂时保留原文）, and the bond market has plummeted. The government is in a very difficult situation. It has never been late in paying the principal and interest on bonds. This is because the valuable securities issued by the country cannot be changed slightly, destroying credit. Unfortunately, the Shanghai Incident followed, and the bond market lost its circulation. Tax sources dried up, and funds were also in danger of shaking. The facts are like this and cannot be avoided. Bondholders mourn the invasion of foreign powers and the danger of the national situation, and are willing to donate their personal interests to alleviate the country's crisis. They have proposed various measures to reduce interest rates, extend the repayment period, and guarantee funds, and have reached a compromise with the government. It has been officially announced that it not only takes care of the government's financial resources and the interests of bondholders, but also fully demonstrates the spirit of unity and solidarity of our people in loving the country. I strongly agree. The government and the people are inherently interdependent. Since bondholders have sacrificed for the national crisis, the government has a responsibility to maintain credit and should respect and fulfill it. This is something that our people can be comforted by."</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Chinese Cotton Mill Resumes Work</h3>
<p>The Shenxin Yarn Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, the Gongyi Yarn Factory in Caojiadu, and the Edison Electric Bulb Factory on Rue Robert, resumed work from the day before yesterday, as usual, in order to take care of the difficult lives of the many workers. They knocked off early in the afternoon to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>Problem of Stopping Loading of Foreign Orders</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce has Replied to the Harmony &amp; Minding Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, because Japanese soldiers invaded the territory and destroyed our commercial area, causing Chinese merchants to be in a state of suspension, sent a letter to the Harmony &amp; Minding Chamber of Commerce, explaining that Chinese merchants had to stop loading foreign orders after the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, hoping to convey this to the foreign merchants. It is now known that the Harmony &amp; Minding Chamber of Commerce has discussed it several times, and yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce asking whether all industries follow this method. The correspondence is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Harmony &amp; Minding Chamber of Commerce wrote: "The letter from Zhan Da stated that all industries have placed orders with foreign manufacturers for various goods. Due to the Shanghai Incident, they cannot be shipped. Please inform all foreign firms to immediately telegraph foreign manufacturers to stop loading goods that have not been shipped. This has been brought to the attention of the committee of our chamber. However, regarding the resolution mentioned in the letter, please confirm whether all members of your chamber will follow it."</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied: "The letter from Zhan stated that regarding the matter of our chamber's previous letter to your chamber regarding the shipment of foreign orders, please check whether all members of our chamber will follow it. Our chamber's previous letter was based on the applications of the Western Medicine Industry, Cloth Industry, Woolen Fabric Industry, Western Pigment Industry, Knitting Industry, and Department Store Industry, and it is said that the above-mentioned guilds have sent the same letters to your chamber, notifying your chamber. The above-mentioned industries occupy an important position in the import industry, and it is hoped that you will carefully examine them. As for other guilds, although they have not reported the handling situation after our chamber notified them of the above situation, they have not yet sent any opinions to the association, stating that they sympathize with our chamber's above-mentioned announcement. This is an obvious fact."</p>
<h3>Relief Team Member Wang Dies from Overwork</h3>
<p>Wang Heping, a native of Zaoning, Jiangsu, is currently twenty years old. He is a student at the Zhenru Huaxia University, and his studies and conduct are excellent. When the war broke out in Shanghai, he was deeply enthusiastic and immediately joined the fourth relief team of the Red Cross to work. He went back and forth through gunfire, never shrinking back. He never avoided wounded soldiers and civilians with infectious diseases, even to the point of contracting smallpox and dying. He died in the Public Concession Isolation Hospital on the 23rd of this month. Everyone who heard about it was saddened.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges North China Not to Sell Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Qingdao, Jinan, and Tianjin Chambers of Commerce and the Silver Money Guilds, questioning Chinese merchants for undermining the boycott movement. The original telegram said, "According to reports from merchants in your area, Japanese goods are selling well in your area, and there are even well-known merchants specializing in operations, which is extremely painful and angry. The Japanese have occupied three provinces and shelled Shanghai City. The civilians in the war zone have bodies everywhere. How tragic is this situation? The business community in your area does not think about the suffering of compatriots in deep water and fire, but instead try to shamelessly serve the enemy and divide my spoils. Is there any conscience? Although the Japanese use violence to prohibit our boycott, how can they send troops to force sales from house to house? Behave well. It is up to you all to change things. Please accept this sincere advice. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Extension of Final Account Period to the End of May</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issued a Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday decided to extend the 20th annual final account period to the end of May of this year and announced to all industries, "It has been found that the merchants in this city had to conduct year-end settlements. Because the war broke out, business was suspended, resulting in the failure to collect and settle accounts as scheduled. They had no choice but to resolve to extend the deadline originally set by the government at the end of January by one month, to the end of February, and announced it on record. Unexpectedly, recently, the Japanese invaders have become more and more aggressive, and the situation has become a long-term confrontation. Business in various places is still in a state of stagnation. All of the previous agreements to settle accounts at the end of February are impossible to fulfill in fact. According to the deadline for settling accounts set by the Executive Yuan, there are three periods: the end of May, the end of September, and the end of January. After deliberation at the joint meeting of the executive supervisors and supervisors of our association, in this unavoidable situation, we have no choice but to postpone the 20th annual final account period by one period, to be held at the end of May of this year. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday said that the Yangtze River basin and coastal areas are cloudy, and there is a risk of rain and fog. There is a northeast wind on the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. There is a cyclone in northern Japan, caused by low pressure passing through the northeast. Also, within 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in 术埠（术埠的具体含义需要根据历史背景判断，暂时保留原文）was 50.0 and the lowest was 25.0. On the same day last year, the highest was 52.0 and the lowest was 36.0.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Your newspaper reports that Japanese planes dropped bread and other food items in Nanxiang and Suzhou. During the European war, the Germans used plague, scarlet fever, typhoid, dysentery, cholera, etc., and placed them in containers to throw into enemy territory to kill the enemy. Now, it is feared that the Japanese are also using this method, their intention is sinister. It is earnestly requested that your esteemed newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column, advising the people in the inland areas that anything dropped by Japanese planes must not be eaten carelessly. Alternatively, the Public Security Bureau should issue announcements everywhere to inform the people so as to avoid falling into their trap. It would be best if the Public Security Bureau could send the dropped food to the Red Cross for inspection to see if there are any germs and report to the International Red Cross to expose the Japanese plot to violate international law. As the saying goes, it is dangerous not to speak out.</p>
<p>With respect,</p>
<p>Liu Qiuwan</p>

<p>its lawful foundation, which I trust you recognize. In due time, I shall elaborate further. Consider the Open Door Policy, initiated by John Hay in 1899, to curb the establishment of spheres of influence by the Great Powers in China, so as to prevent China from disintegrating. Hay’s policy was based on two major principles:</p>
<p>(1) All nations should have equal opportunities in commerce with China. (2) To maintain this equal opportunity, the territorial and administrative integrity of China must be preserved.</p>
<p>However, these two major principles were not new in the foreign policy of the United States at the time. Our country's dealings with other nations have long been based on these principles. The specific proposal for China was to rescue the then critical situation, so as to prevent any harm to the sovereignty and future development of this great Asian nation, and to avoid the risk of escalating hostility among nations of the world. Because at that time, there had been war between China and Japan. When the war ended, three other countries came forward to intervene, preventing Japan from obtaining certain war gains that it wanted. These countries thus gained a sphere of influence. Subsequently, serious unrest occurred in China, endangering the legations of various countries in Beijing, which was also one of the causes. When the legations were under attack, John Hay announced the Open Door Policy as a principle to be observed by all nations in quelling the unrest. Hay stated, "The policy of the U.S. government is to seek a solution so that China may obtain lasting security and peace, preserve China’s territorial and administrative integrity, protect the rights obtained by all friendly nations under treaties and international law, and guarantee the principle of equal and fair trade for the entire world in all parts of China." After Hay proposed this principle, he obtained the agreement of other countries. The British government was particularly enthusiastic in its support. British Prime Minister Salisbury responded to Hay’s declaration, expressing in the most solemn terms his endorsement of the American policy. For the next twenty years, the Open Door Policy became an informal mission of the nations. During the Washington Conference in 1921 and 1922, attended by the major nations with interests in the Pacific, this policy crystallized into the Nine-Power Treaty, which precisely defined and articulated the two major principles from which it originated. Article I of the treaty stipulates that the contracting states, other than China, agree to</p>
<p>(1) Respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China. (2) Provide China with the fullest and most unimpeded opportunity to develop and maintain an effective and stable government. (3) Use their influence to effectively establish and maintain the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations throughout the territory of China. (4) Not to take advantage of conditions in China to seek special rights that would diminish the rights of the people of friendly nations, nor to engage in acts that would secretly endanger the security of friendly nations.</p>
<p>Therefore, this treaty represents a carefully considered and mature international policy. On the one hand, it guarantees the rights and interests of the contracting states in China. On the other hand, it guarantees the people of China the fullest opportunity to develop their sovereignty and independence, so that they can meet the new and enlightened standards maintained among all nations of the world today, without being hindered. At the time the treaty was signed, the world knew that China, after a new revolution, was attempting to gradually develop from an autocratic government into a free system of a self-governing republic. In the third economic and financial aspects, it will take many years of effort to achieve this goal, and its progress will inevitably be slow. Therefore, this treaty is actually a covenant of self-restraint among the signatory states, intending to reject any aggressive policy that contains interference with China’s development trend, and believing that only with this procedure, under the protection of this treaty, can the most complete interests of China and all countries related to China be guaranteed. At that time, the American delegation, under the leadership of Secretary of State Hughes, reported to the President, saying, "It is now believed that the Open Door Policy in China has at least become a reality through this treaty." Furthermore, during the discussion of this treaty, the British chief representative, Lord Balfour, stated, "The British delegation is deeply aware that none of the representatives of the countries at this conference view the habit of spheres of influence as something that can be advocated by any government and tolerated by this conference. As far as the British government is concerned, it has formally and publicly declared that it recognizes that this old habit is completely unsuitable for the current situation." At the same time, the Japanese representative, Baron Kijūrō Shidehara, declared,</p>
<p>"The position of the Japanese government is that no one can deny China’s sacred right to govern itself, and no one can obstruct its creation of a great national destiny."</p>
<p>After the treaty was concluded, it was first ratified and implemented by the nine countries of the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, China, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Subsequently, Norway, Bolivia, Sweden, Denmark, and Mexico also joined. However, although Germany signed the treaty, its parliament has not yet ratified it. It must be remembered that this treaty is one of several treaties and agreements concluded by the relevant countries at the Washington Conference, and these treaties are all interrelated and interdependent. None can be disregarded without disrupting the overall understanding and equilibrium that all the treaties aim to create. The Washington Conference was originally focused on disarmament, with the goal of increasing the possibility of world peace. However, to achieve this goal, it is necessary not only to stop the competition in naval equipment, but also to resolve various entangled problems that could endanger world peace, especially the peace in the Far East that is intertwined with these problems. Based on the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty, the American government gave up its leading position in battleship manufacturing and abandoned the plan to continue fortifying Guam and the Philippines. This is because the Nine-Power Treaty not only guarantees equal commercial opportunities in the Eastern world, but also opposes any country’s military aggression against China. There is no room for discussion about amending or abolishing the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. Six years after the conclusion of the Nine-Power Treaty, the policy of self-restraint by the Great Powers, on which this treaty was based, against aggression against weaker nations, received powerful assistance from the Paris Pact (the so-called Kellogg-Briand Pact), which was ratified and implemented by all nations of the world. Although these two treaties are independent of each other, they are coordinated steps to align the world’s conscience and public opinion in support of a system of orderly development based on international law. This system includes replacing violence with fair and peaceful methods to resolve all disputes, and the plan to protect China from external aggression is an important part of this development. All countries that signed and joined this treaty correctly realize that the orderly and peaceful development in a place where 400 million people live is indispensable for seeking peace and welfare for the world. Any plan to seek welfare for the entire world cannot ignore the welfare and security of China. Recent events in China, especially the hostile acts that originated in the three eastern provinces and have recently extended to Shanghai, make it impossible to amend the various treaties and further demonstrate the importance of the countries related to the Far East faithfully adhering to the aforementioned clauses. We do not need to investigate the causes of the dispute or judge who is to blame between the two countries, because the situation created in any case cannot comply with the obligations stipulated in the aforementioned two treaties. If these two treaties can be faithfully observed, this situation would never have occurred. There is no need to ask about the cause and responsibility for this situation, it is already clear beyond doubt. Therefore, none of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Pact who are not involved in the Sino-Japanese dispute have seen any reason to amend the provisions of the two treaties, and their nationals in Shanghai have suffered danger and loss, which further demonstrates the true value of faithfully fulfilling these treaties. The above is the view of our government, and we see no reason to abandon the enlightened principles adopted by this treaty. We firmly believe that if these clauses can be faithfully observed, the situation today can be avoided, and there is no evidence that U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, who is rightfully adhering to these clauses, will hinder the protection of the legitimate interests of the signatory states and their people in China. On the seventh of last month, our government, acting on the instructions of the President, formally notified Japan and China that it could not recognize any situation created by the two governments in violation of this treaty, or any treaty or agreement concluded, because this treaty concerns the rights of our government and people in China. If other governments in the world can make the same decision and take the same stand, this action will become a lesson, and in the future, it can effectively prevent any title or right obtained by pressure or in violation of treaties from becoming a legitimate act. Furthermore, from the observation of past history, it will eventually lead to China restoring its rights and titles that have been deprived. Our country is one of the great powers in the Pacific, and we firmly believe that the people of China have unlimited prospects. Our dealings with them based on the principles of fairness, patience, and mutual goodwill will surely win the final victory. Our government's policy towards China has always been based on this standard. We deeply know that it is extremely difficult for Chinese politicians to develop their country and government, and progress must be slow. Their attempt to obtain a responsible government</p>
<p>cannot be smooth sailing and will inevitably suffer setbacks, which John Hay and Hughes and their contemporaries had long foreseen. This is the obstacle that the Open Door Policy was intended to address. Now that the politicians of the countries attending the Washington Conference have decided that China should have the necessary time to complete its national development, we agree with them and are prepared to use this as our future policy towards China.

<p>London: Stimson's letter to Borah continues to evoke very positive reactions here. The Times says that the letter clearly shows that the treaties signed in Washington in 1921-22 are of great importance to each other. At that time, the Powers, including Japan, pledged their highest organs and military leaders to provide them with convenience against the disorderly power, China. They expressly guaranteed that they would not exploit China's weakness. This creed of self-restraint must obviously be respected by all countries, otherwise, the countries that abide by the treaty will be impeded. The Times specifically emphasizes Stimson's statement that "America's willingness to abandon its then leading position in building warships and to no longer increase the defense works of Guam and the Philippines is actually in strict observance of the Nine-Power Treaty," saying that if amending the treaty becomes an international incident, America's stable attitude must be reconsidered. This is why Stimson's letter says "damages all countries." Japan's reply to the League of Nations states that "Japan has participated unreservedly in the procedures for settlement stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant," which makes it impossible for Westerners and those who remember that Japan did not notify and even less consult the League of Nations before launching military operations in Manchuria to understand, let alone the recent direct violation of the League of Nations' application and the opening of war in Shanghai. The newspaper also said that Japan had promised to negotiate a final solution regarding Manchuria and Shanghai in the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. The Times also insists that the landing of British troops in Shanghai in 1927 is fundamentally different from today's landing of Japanese troops, because the British move was solely for the purpose of protecting overseas Chinese, had notified the League of Nations in advance, and had not used the concession as a base of operations. What Tokyo should pay serious attention to now is that the longer the line of war is extended, the more unfavorable the trend of diplomats and public opinion will be to Japan. This is not forgetting or ignoring the fundamental fairness of Japan's suffering, but because there are major treaties binding the actions of the Powers in China. It is unexpected that Japan is now acting alone. The Times concludes by saying that the most comforting thing in today's situation is that the other signatories to the Washington treaties are determined to carry out the common policy agreed upon in Washington and will continue to assist China in obtaining an effective and stable administrative system in every way possible. Is it a luxury to want Japan to join the construction work of various countries? (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>London: The Manchester Guardian comments on Stimson's letter to Borah, saying that America's refusal to recognize the changes on Chinese territory and other changes caused by recent events is sufficient to create a solid basis for cooperation between America and the international community. The Daily Express says that Japan's current position contains a warning, Japan first fought with local Chinese governments, and now there is a risk of fighting with the whole of China. The famous publisher Stead wrote to the Times saying that there should be a clear indication that the United Kingdom intends to withdraw its diplomatic representatives from the countries that refuse to accept the recommendations of the League of Nations, and British banks will prohibit the import of goods from those countries. He believes that it is not too late to issue this order now (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>New York: Secretary of State Stimson's public letter to Senator Borah has explained the United States' attitude towards the Far Eastern incident, and American public opinion has expressed approval. Stimson is satisfied with this. People generally believe that this matter will have a clear response abroad, and it can be seen at the League of Nations General Assembly on March 2. The New York Times reports that the League of Nations Council has known before the meeting that the United States is willing to assist the world as a whole in increasing the strength of the treaty with spiritual means of conviction. The newspaper believes that the League of Nations Council may not invite the United States to attend, because the attitude of the United States is already known to the world and does not need to be stated again. The United States is waiting quietly for the League of Nations General Assembly to open, and there will be no new actions in the East before the conference, but there will be separate discussions if there are serious circumstances. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun's editorial this morning criticized Stimson's letter to Borah, saying that the way for the United States to make China self-reliant is not to suspect Japan's purpose, but to cooperate with Japan. Regarding Stimson's theory of naval treaties, the Asahi Shimbun said that the Washington Conference made all participants sacrifice, not just the United States alone. In fact, the arbitrary attitude of the United States has increased the difficulty of subsequent conferences. (26th Reuters)</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei and He Yingqin Comfort the Soldiers at the Front Line</h3>
<p>Investigate those killed in action and provide preferential treatment to their families</p>
<p>Nanjing: Wang Jingwei and He Yingqin telegraphed Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai from Nanjing on the 26th, limited to Zhi Zhong and Dai Zaiyun, saying that this time, our 19th Route Army, 5th Army, and all troops, ordered to defend the territory, have done their best to defend, and their hard work is deeply appreciated. Repeated telegrams report that the soldiers have been wounded and killed, which is particularly distressing. Our soldiers have fought for national dignity and for the survival of the nation, and have gained the glory of justice with sacred sacrifices. They should investigate the names and ranks of all soldiers killed in action, create a register and report it, and provide preferential treatment to their families in accordance with the regulations, in order to recognize their loyalty and valor.

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Entertains the Press</h3>
<p>Shen Jinding Reports on the International Situation</p>
<p>Instructions have been issued to Yan Huiqing</p>
<p>Nanjing: This afternoon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs entertained reporters. Shen Jinding, Director of the Asian Department, spoke on behalf of Luo Wengan, reporting on the current situation of the League of Nations as follows: (1) On the League of Nations side, our country has long been prepared to invoke Article 15, hoping to achieve the League of Nations applying Article 16 to strictly deal with the violent Japan. Therefore, the procedures for invoking Article 15 have been carried out separately in successive meetings, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also instructed Representative Yan to clarify the procedures for invoking Article 15 first. However, the Japanese side strongly opposes this, because the conclusion of invoking Article 15 must lead to Article 16. As to whether Article 16 can be invoked, on the basis of international fair judgment, it should not be abolished due to Japan's opposition. Judging from the fact that our representative requested the opening of the General Assembly on March 3, it is the first step in the procedure. Now, the question is whether the General Assembly can unanimously agree on the same question. People in our country only know about submitting Article 16, but the procedures of Article 15 should be completed before the process of Article 16 can be started. Now our side has fully completed the procedures of Article 15, but many of the preparations on the side of other countries have not been completed. After the League of Nations reviews the reports and documents of both China and Japan, the League of Nations will set a method for the vote, and if members other than the parties concerned unanimously agree to this method, it will be regarded as a decision. If Japan does not accept it, according to the treaty, the country that has accepted the method shall not engage in war, otherwise, members can decisively implement economic sanctions. In the event that the result of the vote is that it cannot pass unless all members other than the parties concerned are unanimous, and if China is not satisfied with the method proposed by the General Assembly, Article 16 will of course not be invoked. So the problem is not that simple. Now the world's air is against Japan, especially small and weak countries, and the General Assembly has clearly expressed its sympathy for our country. If the League of Nations General Assembly adopts a fair approach, all small countries can fully agree. Now it depends on the attitude of the big countries.</p>
<p>Each country has its own situation and its own foreign policy. Whether it can come to assist our country under favorable conditions to achieve the purpose of invoking Article 16, it is still dare not say for sure. Now the Ministry has instructed Representative Yan et al. in principle to examine the situation in Article 16 and proceed accordingly. (2) Attitude of the Powers. (A) The United States is a democratic country, and before public opinion is unified, it is not convenient to express its attitude to the outside world. Although it has great sympathy for us, it still has no concrete policy. Various American groups have requested the US government to take strict measures to sanction Japan, and private individuals have also expressed their sympathy for us with indignation. Before long, the unity within the United States may cause the US government to make further expressions. Recently, Stimson's letter to Borah clearly advocated that the Open Door Policy requires all countries to respect the Nine-Power Treaty. In the serious situation between China and Japan, Stimson's expression is of course very important, but according to personal opinion, it is still empty. I hope to take more concrete measures for the sake of defending the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-Aggression Pact. (B) The British Liberal Party and the Labor Party certainly sympathize with us, but the British nation has always been stable and unwilling to say empty words. British commerce in China, especially the Yangtze River trade, is larger than any other country. Japan disregards international public opinion and</p>
<p>continues to do it. It is expected that when the United Kingdom has no choice, it will take a</p>
<p>leading position in the League of Nations, and it is not impossible to work closely with the United States to advocate more concrete and strict measures. (C) As for France,</p>
<p>there is no doubt that our people are suspicious of France's attitude. Recently, the French government has repeatedly stated that it has no understanding with Japan. (D) Other countries, some follow the lead of the big countries, and the rest sympathize with us, no problem. (3) The Truth about Japan. Aggression against China is their traditional policy for many years. Regardless of whether the Seiyukai or the Minseito are in power, development against China is unchanged, but it is only a matter of gradual progress and rapid progress, military and political aggression and economic and cultural aggression. The warlords are the main advocates of military aggression, but the intellectual circles and the public are opposed to it. In order to maintain their own authority, the warlords have always advocated acting recklessly against China. Who knows that the invasion of Shanghai has repeatedly failed, with particularly high casualties, and the domestic economy is very poor. Japanese trade along the Yangtze River has completely gone bankrupt. The people who have ideas in the country are very dissatisfied. If the situation continues to not stop their reckless military policy, it should also be a matter of course to cause a change in their country before long. Originally, Japan's political organization is different from the world. Military power and political power are separated. If the mobilization is to go to war, it belongs to military power, and the two departments of the General Staff and the Military Command directly present it to the Emperor for approval, without going through the State Council, and there are even those who have actually implemented it without waiting for approval. All military facilities, even the cabinet cannot participate, this kind of organization is a great threat to world peace, and it is also very harmful to Japan itself. If the people have no power to overthrow it, it will lead all countries in the world to correct it together, for example, the world punished German militarism in those years. Now all countries have no determination to implement it, so our country has to resist on its own. In short, today our country's resistance is not only for self-defense, but also for world peace and for maintaining international treaties. This kind of honor is worth any sacrifice. I hope that the world will understand that this war was caused by Japanese militarism, and come to assist China and promote the awakening of Japanese warlords. (26th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Fly to Kunshan and Suzhou to Drop Bombs</h3>

<h3>Japanese Organize White Russian Army</h3>
<p>Intending to Attack the Russian Coastal Provinces - Soviet Officials Attach Great Importance</p>
<p>Moscow - Moscow recently received a telegram from the Soviet semi-official news agency in Beiping, stating that a White Russian army is currently being organized in Liaoning Province, under Japanese control. Its purpose is to attack the Soviet Far East coastal provinces. This news will be published tomorrow. Government agencies here claim that the source of the information is extremely confidential. The Japanese secretly instructed the former White Russian general Kosmin to secretly organize a White Russian army. The Japanese-subsidized "Harbin Times" is secretly recruiting soldiers in Harbin under the pretext of registering unemployed White Russians. How many have been recruited so far is unknown, but in mid-January, it was heard that several teams, each with fifty to one hundred men, had been recruited and sent to Shenyang for training. The Japanese army provides weapons</p>
<p>and equipment, but the operation is extremely cautious to avoid leakage. It is planned that the first two brigades to be established will be commanded by the former White Russian generals Meng Delajin and Mu Desiduofu. When the White Russian army attacks the Soviet coastal provinces, the Japanese army will simultaneously conduct military operations in the Chapiakhal Province outside the western end of the China Eastern Railway. Soviet officials apparently attach great importance to this information, and its content can serve as concrete evidence for the statement made by the Soviet Foreign Minister this week on the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, that the White Russians, with the help of a certain imperialist, are openly planning to attack Soviet territory. Although the Russian newspapers never comment on incidents in Manchuria, their coverage of the Shanghai news clearly expresses sympathy for the Chinese army. (26th National Telegram)</p>
