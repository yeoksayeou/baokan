<h3 id="c17">敎育破產與政府之責任 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>今日我國家之政治如一圑亂絲又加一圑死水無一當人意而最足以令。人痛心最足以危害我國家之根基者則敎育破產是。</p>
<p>二十年來政治之　敗内亂之迭作文化之低落生產之落後敎育之衰落。腐化要爲其大因迄至目前則政府尤視敎育爲兒戲爲裝飾門面之點綴品。可有可羗無足重故敎費長年欠發敎職濫以畀人全國學校都陷於停頓。狀態敎育顯呈整個破產現象。</p>
<p>據最近報紙所載國立大學積欠敎費都至半年之久平津各國立大學積欠敎費共達二百四十萬元北平大學校長沈尹默及七院院長同時辭職平津各大學代表圑迭向府院敎部呼籲終於不得要領其他各首市縣敎育界。爲敎費而請願哀求更爲極普遍之常事夫敎費積欠至半年之久學校究何。由而敷衍其塲面從事敎育事業者又究何由而維持其生活今日我國家財。政一再核減軍費仍佔一千八百萬而政費則僅四百萬年來發行公債共達。九萬萬亦皆用之於軍費國家悉索敝賦搜刮人民之血肉以養軍而其結果。則土不能守宼不能禦恰如新財次林康侯氏日前所言「軍隊所報酬我國民者内戰士匪共黨鴉片而已」吾人誠不解政府罄帑以養軍之目的尤。不解政府欠發敎費坐視學校停頓敎育破產之用意。</p>
<p>尤有甚者據北平消息前曾絶食呼籲和平之北洋工學院院長五季緒電李石曾責問撥發庚欵十萬元供某伶人赴歐考察事又據消息去歲年底某某數部各有特種進欵公務人員竟得特發雙薪夫庚欵固專爲補助文化事業者但各大學經費艱窘將至關門敎界人士枵腹從公生計寖至斷絶就令某伶人赴歐考察爲有必要而權其輕重量其綏急十萬元之數究應先作何用抑又何能一手操縱以個人之好惡自由支配至於從政從敎皆爲國家服務待遇即應一律平等今從敎者枵腹從公無以自存而一部分從政者反發雙薪特示優渥則又何說此種萬不應有之怪現象皆足爲我政府今日忽視敎育坐以致敎育破產之明證。</p>
<p>此猶就敎育經費一方面而言也至於敎育行政則更不可說整個敎育界完全官僚化從事敎育者不必專才亦不問其學識敎職爲敷衍情面之禮物爲安置私人之閑職於是而敎育重職虚懸於是而中央大學校長被毆窮極醜態怪象百出而猶以學風敗壞責在學生擇師擇長皆爲好亂此種現象誠爲世界所未有吾人除痛心疾首而外更有何話可說。</p>
<p>夫敎育爲立國之根本關乎國家百年大計視今日敎育之成績即可以斷他日國家之治亂政府今日之忽視敎育坐致其破產不僅足以致目前全國靑年失學亦即　喪國家之元氣　掘國家之命根其禍國不僅在目前且遠至數十百年以後關係之重大有若此者今日世界各國莫不以竭力發展敎育培植靑年爲急務夫果一國而不能維持最低限度之敎育經費則其政府尙能謂爲政府耶。</p>
<p>吾人認爲今日軍費萬不可不减敎費萬不可不增更不可不按期撥付官僚主義之侵入敎育界爲敎育之致命隠疾尤不可不堅决反對力予杜絶。</p>
<p>吾人敢作沉痛之大聲疾呼籲請我國人我敎育界自起共挽救此足以亡國滅種之危機</p>

<p>孟子說··『是非之心，人皆有之。』生理心理學家把人的頭腦解剖實騐了幾千百交次，至今沒有找着這樣一個專管是非的東西。</p>
<p>是非只是判斷行爲的一種符號。這種判斷的能力是在判斷上得來的。它是在實際生活裹學得的本領，不是與生俱來的良知良能。</p>
<p>在實際生活中人們對於某一種行爲加以某一種符號，絲毫不容假借，久而久之，習慣成自然，是的便會說是，非的便會說非，沒有什麽參差。如果在實際生活中，有人混亂黑白，指鹿爲馬，是的有時說作非，非的有時說作是，這樣一來，是非便不能分明了</p>
<p>爲什麽要顚倒是非？大凡自已討便宜的時候，不願是非分明，只要自已吃了一點虧便大聲疾呼的要人家辨别是非。「是非」是上算者的敵人。「明是非」是吃虧者的呼援。人不能老是上算，也不能老是吃虧，故有時要是非，有時不要是非。</p>
<p>靖節公有詩說··『榮衰無定在，彼此更共之。』「是」豈能專屬於我？「非」豈能常屬於人？</p>
<p>是非如貞操，旣已揮之而去，何能招之即來？</p>

<p>慨自瀋變迄今。倐逾四月。警耗頻聞。愁腸欲裂。日昨適値休沐。迺約同志數人。共作郊外之游。藉遣餘悶。歸時道經本埠勞合路之友聲旅行圑。遂相偕入内小憇。坐甫定。偶見該圑墻壁上懸有色澤鮮明之地圖二幀。予頗異而詢之。乃始知爲暴日於數年前調查我東北各地而出版之要圖。一曰滿鮮槪念圖。一曰滿蒙新地圖。其名稱雖異。而内容則無二致。蓋皆以侵略整個滿蒙爲目的。即遼吉黑熱河及東蒙古是也。關於交通方面。則除我國之固有鐵道外。彼等更以最近完成之吉會路。及横貫南北之南滿路爲主幹。凡遇沿綫各要鎭之可通腹地者。其間距離若干及如何取徑。無不詳爲分析。而尤可注意者。則爲各小市集之名稱。悉註日文。此其便於侵略之野心。昭然可見。另如東省著名出產之大豆羊毛煤鐵木材等物。則分别繪狀於各產地之部位。類皆維妙維肖。極富有引人歆羨之色彩。他若駐有日本領事之各商埠。則必畫有一太陽旗以爲標幟。至今日而得觀斯圖。彌覺心痛。猶憶去春予嘗聞黃任之先生自日本歸國之言曰。渠在扶桑游歷時。輙見彼國大小機關之辦公桌上。無不懸有一滿蒙新地圖。而於各地車站之廣告牌上。亦時見有往滿蒙去之字樣。彼國謀我旣如是之急。而我將何如。不謂時隔半載。而東北竟告淪亡。於以知坐而言。固遠不若起而行之速且效也。予觀斯圖旣畢。不禁爲之欷歔。繼念國人之或未盡知。爰泚筆爲之記。</p>

<p>電影明星胡蝶女士之自述</p>
<p>更深刻一些講，婦女們在我們的國度聚，可以說是常常受到社會的壓迫與欺凌的；婦女們在普遍的壓迫與欺凌之下，弱者是屈服了，强者還在奮鬥。不過，我們要知道，奮　的方式也許不同，奮鬥的力量是相同的。爲什麽社會上把政治無台上的女要人看得太重，而把藝術之圍地中的女演員看得太輕呢？</p>
<p>我敢說，如果這種畸形的社會心理不變換過去，那麽，什麽藝術，什麽婦女運動都不能有成攻的希冀了。</p>
<p>話愈說愈遠了，我寫　一篇文字的動機，其目的是把一個被許多人注意的職業女子的生活和其他，忠誠地暴露出來。我並不爲胡蝶女士做千篇一律的讚頌，我也並不爲胡蝶女士或伊所主演的影片做義務的宣傳。在這裹，希望人家知道一些電影女明星的眞的藝術的生活。不是像人家平時所猜想的一樣的啊。</p>
<p>丨以下，都是胡蝶女士親口的談話，我很忠實地記下來的。丨蘇鳳·</p>
<p>胡蝶女士說</p>
<p>轉變從北四川路到杜美路，彷彿有一種「轉變」··上海，不曾給我以趣味過；給我以趣味的，僅僅是我的家庭和我的工作，因此，我所謂「轉變」乾，是由一方面的自由與安閒變爲多方面的勞動。然而我對於我的人生丨實在不僅是我的人生丨未始不因着經騐的增加而有了一種深切的認識。我相信，我的勞動對於我的自由與安閒正是一些帮助；而且我又相信，不勞動的人也許就是沒有自由沒有安閒的人；所以，我對於我的勞動，也成爲一種有意義的享樂了。但是，社會上有許多人不曾知道這許多，許多人都以爲做一個比較有地位的電影女演員是包圍在一個迷醉的狀態中的，啊！我先來講個故事吧··</p>
<p>任人弋獲焉。其法結網爲罩。自其後罩之。一一次第捕取。取時勿驚其餘。一雀受驚。則羣飛去。竟夕無所得矣。故經騐不精。手術不敏者。弗敢嘗試。良以一人之失。妨及同儕之利。必干衆怒。備受譴尤也。鳴呼。承蜩弄丸。各有其妙。天下事雖小道末藝。亦必有歷久之修養。而無一朝之僥倖。况乎文章之事。誠如太史公言。「非好學深思。心知其故。固難爲淺見寡聞者道也。」奈何後進小生。未嘗甘苦。率爾操觚。便欲衙官屈宋。習爲季緒駡人。其智不出漁人弋者下哉。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第二回談笑對良師傳噩耗家園遇刦零丁憐膩友慰悽情旅室生春不過我又想起。我那堂叔安大奎。在天津開了個福聚祥綢緞莊。聽說我父親也有點股分在内。以前我的學費。常常也由那裹撥匯。前天我已寫信給這位堂叔。請他先替我籌畫一筆錢寄來。等這錢到後。我再定行止。承你這般關切。我是很感謝你這番美意。只是我能告訴你的。目前就只有這些話。往後究竟怎樣。只好到那時候再和你細談。彼此旣然如此的不見外。我總不背着你行事好啦。梁笑雲很親暱的回答道。君子報仇在三年。我總勸你不要過性急。還是在北京好好讀書。畢了業再說吧。家裹旣然已閙得那般糟。你回去也沒有用。更犯不着冐那種危險。赤手空拳去和土匪作對。若僅僅差幾個錢花。不算什麽難事。便是我這做朋友的。也能隨便通融。不必寫信去問令叔要。安玉田不覺苦笑道。我怎麽好意思要你帮我的忙呢。但你這番意思實在待我太好。我眞說不出該怎樣謝謝你。梁笑雲忽地撒嬌道。我不來。别人家一番誠心誠意對你。你郤總是將我當外人。爲什麽不好意思要我帮你的忙。又爲什麽定要說那樣的客氣話謝謝我。難道我這個人眞不配與你做朋友嗎。安玉田想不到會一言將這位多情的美人兒說惱。就只好連陪不是道。得啦。算我苫塊昏迷。不會說話。請你不要生氣。不要見怪罷。如今像我這樣孤苦零丁。正需要朋友帮忙。何况你又是這樣一個最好的朋友。更是我求之不得的。我只怕我自已不配。還敢那麽不懂好歹竟對你嫌棄起來了嗎。梁笑雲微笑道</p>
<p>好已經好在頭裹。我是與你交定了這份朋友了。並也不怕你嫌棄我。反正你總不見得好意思能當面說出嫌棄我的話來吧。如今你正悲傷的時候。我也不再與你多頂這些閒嘴。且盡盡我的心。陪陪你。哄哄你再說。免得悶壞了你這個人。你看。屋子裹冷氷氷的。虧你一個人在這兒哭哭啼啼。　了那麽幾天。幹嗎呢。要這樣糟踏自已。今天沒有别的人。我想必你也還沒吃過一頓舒服飯。待我呌茶房去酒館裹要幾樣菜來我陪你吃着玩吧。安玉田要待攔阻。梁笑雲身輕如燕。郤早已自去呌茶房辦理。移時。酒菜送到。都是幾樣很精美的可口食品。梁笑雲拖着安玉田就座。自已側面相陪。先是紅袖提壼。殷勤勸酒。繼又調羹佈食。婉促加　。安玉田情不可郤。只好將就吃些。梁笑雲又於座上談笑風生。盡揀些趣味雋永的閒話來說。絶不再提及安玉田不幸的家事。想把安玉田愁懷消盡。且陶醉在這旖旎風光的溫柔鄕裹。果然也就陋室生春。使安玉田那　首蹙額的臉上。也漸起了一絲笑意。看看酒酣飯飽。忽的茶房又進來報告道。安先生電話。師範大學打來的。姓李。請你快去接話。安玉田不由大吃一驚。推杯而起。拔脚便走。欲知有何事故。且待下回分說·</p>

<p>捕房律師陳述經過十時許　　、馮推事命將被告嚴斌帶案、嚴仍延陳文·薛嘉圻·王祖勳·三律師出庭辯護、即據捕房律師博良·王耀堂·起稱、今捕房控告被告於一月十一號下午二時、結夥在麥根路碼頭用脅迫手段、刦去英商麥賓洋行駁船一艘、内裝煤　餘噸、價値七百五十元、犯刑法第三百四十八條結夥强盜案提起公訴、并詳述本案經過情形、謂　商麥賓洋行主麥賓氏、因向浦東日商二井洋行定購</p>
<p>煤斤五十噸以無堆棧、故向新閘路七百二十九號·七百三十一號·吳永昌煤號租賃堆煤之所、乃雇就船户吳金根之駁船一艘、於十一號午刻運抵麥根路碼頭、由小工搬運起岸、至二時許、忽有十餘人到、來將小工趕散、并將煤十餘噸及駁船撑去駛往閘北、</p>
<p>被扣五人奉命釋放當經麥氏報告捕房、派中西探赴閘北公安局二區四分所調查、由所長設法將煤業公會内之五人帶至公安局、該五人名葉永福·葉生朝·夏　生·嚴斌·尙有一人不知姓名、當時均承認將船撑去、探員乃要求准予暫押、至晚間八時爲限、當有覆音以便回至捕房商議辦法、迨至八時、中西探以電話詢問公安局、據稱該五人已奉市公安局命令釋放探員祇得禀請鈞院簽發拘票、將嚴斌拘獲、、抄出徽章一枚</p>
<p>捕房提出證據四點今捕房有證　四種提出、㈠麥賓洋行向二井洋行購煤之契約、㈡麥賓向吳永昌租借堆棧之租契、㈢煤業同業公會自案發後、即函致戈登路捕房、承認搬運煤斤、㈣上海市民懲　會有信通知新閘路老鳳祥銀樓、言詞恐嚇欲將鄰居吳永昌煤號搗毁、尙有各人證之供詞呈案請究、</p>

<p>人到來、自稱爲煤業公會派來調查貨物、余當向質問有無憑證、該二人曰無、余正欲　捕之際、該二人乃又向余曰、煤旣屬爾物則我等當據情回報公會、言畢遂去、余候至一時四十分、見無動靜、乃向站崗之一千零四十四號華捕聲明煤係余物、遂亦回去至二時許、余接得報告、謂煤被抗日會運去且其時該捕亦已落差致發生此事、當即報告捕房云云、述畢、由被告律師向麥氏駁詰一過、</p>
<p>嚴斌供述始末情形詰之被告嚴炳供稱、此項日煤、先由抗日會查悉、因抗日會并無堆棧故經煤業公會商議之下、以義泰興西棧、亦屬煤業會員、故向商借堆棧、由調查股長王某派余前往義泰興西棧登記煤數、及抵該處、則船尙未到、故沿河行至舢板廠新橋地方察視、余并未登船、嗣該船由抗日會唐姓等撑至堆棧起岸、計有煤十噸零一　、現均存儲於義泰興西棧云云、</p>
<p>見證三人相繼供述又據見證梅曾貴供、在吳金根處爲船夥、該項煤斤由我承運、船抵秈板廠新橋停泊卸貨、共五十噸、當時卸去卅六噸、尙有十四噸、正欲起卸、突有抗日會職員十餘人到來阻止卸貨、且破口駡人、將船撑往浜北、被告當時并不在塲直至義泰興西棧、始見被告與撑船之七八人同在一處等詞、又據見證戚玉林供十六歲、在吳永昌號爲學徒、當時有抗日會職員十人、指煤爲日貨、故將船撑往浜北、惟被告當時我未看見、又據見證吳金根供述一過、對於此案、不甚明瞭、亦無所證明、</p>
<p>律師提出管轄問題遂由被告律師薛嘉圻提出管轄問題謂按照協定第五條、捕房祇能就租界内犯罪者起訴、今本案發生地點係屬華界、因該船停泊於蘇州河内而蘇州河則地屬華界、故捕房無權起訴、按照刑事訴訟法三百十八條、應諭知不受理、</p>
<p>雙方辯論歷二小時訊至此、人證已畢馮推事諭令開始辯論、遂由捕房律師與被告律師互起辯論良久、對於管轄問題、爭論頗烈、約歷二小時、始各畢其辯詞、末由檢察官李英發表意見一過、馮推事諭辯論終結、當庭宣告判决、被告嚴斌無罪、上訴期内交妥保、諭畢、因被告方面對於保證、早已預備、故一聞交保釋放、即由旁聽之煤業同人拍手歡迎、一面雇就汽車一輛、將白布一方、上書「歡迎嚴斌同志出獄」字樣、、作爲旗幟懸於車頭、將嚴擁登汽車、疾馳出院而去、</p>

<p>— 范漢生</p>
<p>自國難發生以來、全國人民大半在憤怒、苦悶痛恨迷亂中生活、而尤以感情最豐富的靑年學生爲甚他們因痛恨日帝國主義的横蠻、國際聯盟的無能、但他們更痛恨養有二百萬大兵的政府當局軍事的不抵抗、外交之無辦法、但在萬分失望之中、他們曾槺槪激昻的往各地宣傳他們曾徘徊在街頭向人募捐、他們曾紛紛組織義勇軍、他們曾幾次忍飢耐寒的往首都向政府請願、他們也曾幹遊行、示威、貼標語、喊口號等「洩氣」的工作、最後他們忍痛罷課了、想促醒政府、可是事實上告訴我們三四月來、他們非但沒有達到救國的目的、反犧牲了許多寶貴的光陰、更賺得了一顆疲勞的心、而陷於失望消極之路、我們知道、在民四民八等時候的靑年學生、、也就是現在政治和社會上負責的人、他們那時愛國的熱誠與救國的决心、並不讓現在一般的靑年學生、祇爲了他們不肯充實自已的學力、不肯做實際的工作、所以到了他們上台負責的時候、還是和從前他們所痛恨的人一樣、而另被人痛恨、致造成了今日内憂外患交迫的局面、所以今後我們、應不再蹈從前的覆轍、我以爲現在靑年學生應努力的、並不是向政府請願、對日宣戰、也不是幹那徒手的軍事訓練、最切實的工作、却在「深入民間去喚醒民衆、組織民衆、」因爲國家大事若祇靠統治階級、智識階級去維持、是絶對不行的、非四萬萬阿斗大家負起責任來、中國永不能强盛、這偉大而有意義的工作、祇有靑年學生能幹、也祇有靑年學生肯幹、所以靑年學生應不避艱難的幹這工作、而使其早日實現、我敢担保的說「假如四萬萬的阿斗都醒了、其驚人的力量、定能震撼世界、而使帝國主義駭汗失色、」</p>
<p>除了幹這工作之外、同時還應充實各人自已的學問、因爲要在世界保持一偉大的民族、要建立一强盛的國家非有充分的學術預備不可、日本所以如此强、也是他們最近五六十年來努力學術的結果、與其說日本此次以武力占據我們東三省、倒不如說他們以學術占據我們東三省、英國倍根說、「智識即權力、」這話是一些不差的、試觀現在世界上、不論戰時平時的一切有力的工具製造和利用、那一樣不繫於智識的高低、所以提高智識是永久的禦侮工作、今後我們應向這面努力、打倒帝國主義、非一時的感情所能奏效、騒然的呐喊、茫然的徬徨、徒使我們失望而已、我們具曾國藩所說、「打脫牙和血呑」的精神、以十二分嚴肅的責任心、堅毅奮邁的認淸了目標向前奮鬥、我們終有勝利的一天、（乙）</p>

<p>據昨日本報所載，長江航路自去年十月以來，即發生障碍，水淺灘高，五千噸以上的大船不能行駛，因此大船停駛數月之久，海關派人切實精密測量的結果，發現新的航路，竟有十五尺的深水可以通航無阻，讀了這段新聞，使我發生一點小小的感想。</p>
<p>國民政府好比船上的機器房，政府當局好比船上的機師，我們小百姓好比船上的乘客，我們只知道向我們的目的地去，我們的目的地就是安居樂業，外不受他國的侵凌，内不受飢寒禍變的迫害，這就是小百姓對於政府的唯一希望，好比船上的乘客希望機師不要把路線走錯了，弄得船沉人溺一樣。</p>
<p>但是目前我們似乎覺得我們船上的機師所走的路線有些不大正確，也許竟然是走錯了，最初以爲不過是多繞幾里路，多費一點旅行的時間而已，我們還極力忍耐，可是近來的情形更壞，在這個磯頭上碰一下，在那個淺灘上擱一會，船身已經有些不牢固了，誰知道一夜的颶風惡浪，我們的船身的東北角上穿了一個大洞，可怕的東洋惡潮，只是不停地衝進來，我們乘客的生命眞是危險到萬分，我們機師還不給我們快些開足馬力，改正航路嗎？</p>
<p>一條長江尙且有新航路呆尋，難道太平洋之大，中國更無新航路可尋嗎？願我們的政府，速即改正航路重新奠定救國救民的方針，不要再在磯頭上亂碰，淺灘上亂竄了！</p>

<h3 id="c166">亭子間階級 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 丁奴</p>
<p>我們知道，自從帝國主義者携其殺人不見血的經濟侵略，頒下總攻擊令以來，中國的社會，經濟，政治，便被轟擊得粉碎糜爛了。我們眼睛看着，農村經濟塌然崩潰了，隨見着一批一批的游民走向都市裹集中，後來，中國政治走不上軌道，經濟問題無法解决，失業者便日更加多，而世界的不景氣更益促其尖銳化。於是，亭了間階級，便被確立了。</p>
<p>近幾年來，我親眼見着有許多的朋友，自從踏出了學校的大門，東奔西跑，走頭無路，到頭來便莫可奈何似的做起亭子間階級的人物來了。更有的在人海裹浸浴過了一會，因爲吸不慣那臭腥的空氣，也像打敗仗的士卒似的退到這最後的防線來了。所以現在，任你走遍滬南滬北，滬東滬西，我們都能發現亭子間的影子，而且這些亭子間都多是充實的。</p>
<p>住在亭子間裹的人，却不都是文丐，有好多是吃飽飯閒居，在等候機會的。大抵他們都是貪便宜，每月只要付了幾塊錢的代價，人生三大問題便算解决了一個。日間，如果高興的話，就不妨自已動手，或是到附近的菜館裹，不然，那就三塊燒餅過一餐，也算不了什麽一回事。生活雖苦，但却不曾失之呆板；物貿享受雖然差一點，但精神上却是愉快的。</p>
<p>在從前，亭子間有一度爲普羅作家所利用過，在熱烈地呼喊着『農工階級起來』的口號，而今勢力雖然沒有這樣大了，但我們却相信有不少的傑作，是在亭了間裹脫稿的。所以在學上所見的亭子間階級，是比普通所見的亭了間階級更來得有意義些。</p>
<p>住在亭子間裹的人，可謂安逸極了。外面儘管砲火連天，殺聲四起，亭子間也不會因之搗毁。所以亭子間階級的存在，倒是一個很好的現象。</p>
<p>從以上所檢討，我們把亭子間認作是中國濟經情形的縮影，眞是千眞萬確的。而亭子間階級的人物，更可算爲現代敎育破產的例證，而最後使這些人物沒有出路的，當然是政治不上軌道，實業不振，百般病症了。所以我說，亭子間實可說是中國現狀的縮影！</p>

<h3 id="c169">怎樣才有乾凈的水吃 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 陶小桃</p>
<p>我們要想乾凈的水，有兩種方法，㈠蒸溜。㈡過濾。我現在分别寫在下面··</p>
<p>㈠蒸溜</p>
<p>拿一個燒瓶，中間放五分之三的水，瓶口塞一軟木塞，軟木塞中間，插一根彎曲玻璃管。次把管短的一端插在燒瓶中，不要達到水面，把較長的一端，伸出瓶外。次將玻璃管之較長的一端上套一節竹筒，竹筒裹使冷水流着，再在這玻璃管的下端放一空瓶，把空瓶放在冷水裹，然後用火在燒瓶底下燒。等到水沸時，蒸汽便從玻璃管中逃出，遇着竹筒中的冷，蒸汽即化成水從管中跑到瓶中。這水便是蒸溜水。竹筒中的冷水要是常換，以防變熱，致使蒸汽不能凝水，這蒸溜水是很衛生，化學藥品的調製，以及醫院裹都用這種蒸溜水。實騐室裏造蒸溜水要費一兩小時才能蒸溜出一小杯。大量的蒸溜水是要由工廠辦理。</p>
<p>㈡過濾</p>
<p>取一個花盆，花盆底下洞中塞一塊海棉（沒有海棉可用絲瓜筋代替）然後在盆底鋪一層一寸多厚的木炭屑；木炭屑上再鋪一層淸潔的細沙；細沙上鋪一層兩寸厚的粗石子。這個濾水器就成功了。你把汚水倒在花盆中，一忽兒就有淸潔的水從盆底小洞中流出來。濾出的水燒沸了喝更好，濾水器也要常常洗滌，以免不淸潔的東西留在裏面。這個花盆濾水器很實用，只要三角錢就可以做成功了。</p>

<p>— 杏子</p>
<p>假如你要看戲，你並不必花錢去大舞台天蟾舞台等大戲塲，新世界大世界以及其他一切比較寛闊的馬路上儘多着，而且這裏的戲，價旣廉，而又别有風致，夠你玩味，假如你身邊沒有帶錢，却也可以白聽一闋，兩脚開溜。</p>
<p>這戲塲的招牌，常常是露天舞台自由舞台，獨脚舞台，小舞台，平民舞台等。這些名詞都是十分恰當的，露天，自由，活畫出了它整個的圖案。觀衆當然沒有一個是富翁或貴客，也沒有一個摩登小姐或少爺，命名爲平民舞台，也正是恰如其分。</p>
<p>大抵這舞台都只有三兩位角色，有的僅僅一個人那便是獨脚舞台了。</p>
<p>一頂紅綠紙糊成的美麗的「王」冠，或「官」冠，歪歪地帶在一個塗滿了粉，畫滿了墨而又髮蓬蓬的頭上，身上還披上一件齷齪不堪的破戲衣，踱着方步，口裏「鐺，······鐺，······，只鐺······Ｚｏｎ······」另外一個人優閑地拉着胡琴，戲幕便就此拉開。假如他唱的是「寳蟾進酒」或「天女散花」等等的戲，那種扭揑作態的怪樣與破　似的聲音，眞令你哭笑不得。</p>
<p>他們一個人大多都須担任好幾個角色，鑼，鼓，胡琴，以及一切的樂器，也</p>
<p>都是一張嘴兼任，他們都沒有固定的台址，走到什麽地方，便在什麽地方。</p>
<p>一　戲唱完之後，便照例的「朋友帮帮忙，」「沒有錢的帮帮塲面，」三枚五枚，隨你任意佈施</p>

<p>老三章小刀會佔領上海Ｘ小刀會的起源</p>
<p>一八五一年（咸豐元年）太平天國軍自兩粤發動後，即蔓延於長江流域。同時有三點會的支派小刀會開始活動，並佔據厦門。小刀會所奉爲道敎，並且允許吸食鴉片，宗敎信仰旣與太平軍不同，遂爲太平軍所鄙視。</p>
<p>咸豐三年九月七日，小刀會有一部分，竄至上海，旋即佔領上海城邑。是日適逢秋季祀孔廟之是日，城門大開，小刀會六百人隨衆入城，分擊各衙署，縣令袁祖德被害，蘇松太道吳健章在私宅被困。當時城内之内應者，擲紅布於街道，小刀會黨人取紅布　頭，故有「紅頭」之稱。小刀會的首領爲劉麗川，爲廣東人，本業糖商，數年之前，曾在上海組織三點會。劉麗川酷嗜鴉片，但人頗能幹而有决斷。其部下有陳阿林，小有才略，居中指揮，實小刀會事實上的首領。小刀會以推翻滿洲政府，召號民衆，與太平軍的興漢滅滿的主義，原無不同。當代官書稱此次亂事，名之曰閩廣會匪之亂，但社會一般人民稱之曰小金珠造反，因小金珠爲劉麗川之綽號也。</p>
<p>城陷之後，小刀會發生内閧，分爲廣東福建兩帮，廣東帮責福建帮據掠獨多，秩序遂亂。</p>
<p>時松滬太道吳健章仍被困於私宅，有二西人一爲海爾博士，一爲史密斯君自租界潛入城中，至吳健章私宅，爲之喬裝，夜縋出城。先至敎士晏馬太博士家，因博士之家在城郭附近，後復遷至祺昌洋行，吳健章遂免於難。</p>

<p>Representatives of Organizations to Greet in Formation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Because the National Government received news that Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Sun Ke would arrive in Nanjing from Hangzhou on the 20th, it notified all agencies to prepare to welcome them. It also telegraphed Hangzhou to inquire whether the three would be traveling by special train or by plane and their departure time in order to greet them. On the morning of the 20th, a telegram was received from Hangzhou stating that Wang and Sun had gone to Shanghai together to consult with important figures there and would then take a special train to Nanjing.

Chiang's bodyguard, Wang Shihe, arrived in Nanjing on the 20th to arrange Chiang's residence. According to Wang, Chiang had originally planned to depart by plane on the morning of the 20th, but due to heavy fog, it was not possible to fly, so the departure was postponed by one day. The police department in Nanjing has informed all organizations, schools, and shops to display flags to welcome them. Welcome slogans have been posted along the streets and near the airfield. The public believes that the arrival of Wang and Chiang will bring a sense of stability to the party and the nation and has generated boundless new hope.

<p>Chiang, Wang, and Sun Agreed on Three Major Policies in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Diplomacy, Finance, Military Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain news agency's draft, Wang, Chiang, and Sun discussed three policies in Hangzhou: diplomacy, finance, and military affairs. 1. In diplomacy, before severing relations with Japan, there must be adequate military and financial preparations, otherwise, there will be unimaginable troubles in the future. As a result, a plan to prevent problems in advance was devised. 2. In finance, the government will cooperate with the financial community to draft and implement a reorganization plan for the principal and interest of all public bonds to protect national finances, extending the repayment period, reducing interest rates, and issuing a national crisis bond. 3. In military affairs, there are more than 120 divisions of hired soldiers, but each division is understaffed, lacks firearms, and lacks military supplies. Morale is low, which is not the way to deal with national crises and will significantly affect the financial future. As a result of the discussion, it was assumed that there would be eighty divisions in the country, divided into two types, A and B. Each division would receive a monthly salary of 160,000 for Type A and 120,000 for Type B, saving military expenses and resources for reorganization. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Remarks from Diplomatic Authorities <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Attitude towards Japan Has Become More Active</p>
<p>Willing to Accept Sanctions If There Are Mistakes</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a reporter's interview with diplomatic authorities, the government has decided to submit the Sino-Japanese issue to the current meeting in accordance with Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Representative Yan is already on his way and will first go to England to make contact with the British authorities before going to Geneva. The instructions here will be telegraphed when Yan arrives in Geneva. The wording and content have been carefully considered and adjusted. It is not convenient to publish them at this time, but it is believed that they will gain the sympathy of the people when they are made public in the future because the government's attitude towards Japan has shifted from gradual progress to an active course. Twenty years ago, I believed that the Sino-Japanese dispute would be a major problem in the future, so I studied and worried about it. Last year, when I was in Guangzhou, I visited the Wakatsuki Cabinet of the Minseito Party in Japan to see if they had changed their traditional policy of aggression against China and whether they were aware of the need to seek countermeasures. The results of the visit proved that the other side had not yet awakened from its traditional policy of dual diplomacy. Not long after, the September 18th Incident occurred, and the Wakatsuki Cabinet suddenly stepped down. When the September 18th Incident occurred, the Wakatsuki government was, of course, aware of it. The current Inukai Cabinet still follows the original policy. All our people should work together to resist violence. We should not complain and reduce our external capabilities. I am not here to speculate or to seek office. I am here to contribute to the people based on the results of my years of research. If there are any mistakes, I am willing to accept the sanctions of the people. My proposals have been adopted by the central government. I am preparing to carefully consider this difficult situation for one or two weeks. As for personnel matters such as promotions, demotions, transfers, and supplements in the department and transfers and deployments in embassies, I currently have no time for these matters. I will also temporarily not meet with unnecessary guests, and concentrate all my energy on this. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ten people, including the counselors and consuls-general of the British, French, and American embassies, met with Chen Youren for several hours this afternoon to discuss international views on the Sino-Japanese issue. England, the United States, and France believe that Chiang and Wang's coming to Nanjing hand-in-hand has stabilized the public's sentiment and improved international perception.

<h3 id="e13">Minister of Military Affairs Telegraphed to Military Commanders Nationwide <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Describing Difficulties in Raising Military Expenses</p>
<p>Please Understand the Difficulties and Endure to Support the Situation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, telegraphed to all military commanders nationwide on the 20th, stating: "The central government's directly administered troops, agencies, and military expenses, before November, were paid monthly at 2.5 million to 100,000 yuan. Since December, the Finance Committee has reduced it to 18 million yuan. The expenses of all troops are allocated according to the budget, only 50% of the budget amount. However, the actual expenditure is still more than 18.8 million yuan, which is a very difficult situation. However, in the face of the national crisis, knowing that the central government is in financial difficulty, we dare not make further requests. This time, the central government was reorganized, and the finance minister was replaced. During the transition period, no one was responsible for the allocation of military expenses. After several negotiations, Minister Song finally handled the allocation of 4.1 million yuan in cash for military expenses in December, and 13.9 million yuan in long-term payment orders. The Military Supply Department discounted approximately 5 million yuan of these payment orders at the Central Bank and distributed them to various troops and agencies, which is about 40% cash and 60% promissory notes. Although it can be said that we barely managed to cope, we have already deeply felt the difficulties, which have affected the supplies of the various troops. There is a risk of food shortages from time to time. There are telegrams urging payment as urgently as if fires are burning. The Central Headquarters completed the reorganization of the central government, and the financial authorities have someone in charge. The military expenses must be allocated as scheduled to comfort the long-awaited hope of our officers and soldiers at the front. Unexpectedly, as of today, only 2.3 million yuan in military expenses have been allocated, which can only be distributed 10% to 20% to the various troops and agencies. Although it is better than nothing, it is a drop in the bucket, how can it help? After many letters and telegrams, we also appealed to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, but the central government's monthly tax revenue is only 7 to 8 million yuan, a huge difference. Therefore, there is no reliable way to maintain the situation, which has made the headquarters' difficulties reach the extreme. Those who request money are only given empty words of comfort, and there is nothing that can be done. The Ministry of Finance has no money to allocate, and the bank does not allow discounting. The headquarters is not a profit-making organization that can be compared. It lacks the magic to make gold and has no time to provide relief. The generals who are suppressing the bandits have all reported that their supplies have been cut off and are in a desperate situation. They must guard against the Red bandits taking the opportunity to incite the officers and soldiers, and they must also worry about the entire army mutinying without food. It is extremely dangerous to fight the cunning Red bandits with hungry soldiers. If we do not take immediate measures to maintain the situation, there will be those who blame the local authorities for providing supplies, those who forcibly borrow from merchants, those who intercept tax revenue, and those who are incited to mutiny. A dangerous situation is imminent. In addition to appealing to the National Government and the Executive Yuan again, and ordering the Military Supply Department to send personnel to the Ministry of Finance day and night to demand money, the headquarters also petitioned the Special Committee. All agreed that the central government's finances were unusually exhausted and decided to reduce party and government expenses from 4 million to 2 million yuan and military expenses from 18 million to 16 million yuan from January. It is hoped that after the reduction, the Ministry of Finance will be able to allocate cash on time, so that the headquarters and various troops and agencies can endure the pain and continue to support the situation. The above is a rough description of the situation since December. As for the 2.3 million yuan received in January, it has been distributed to the Jiangxi bandit suppression troops at 50% cash and 50% promissory notes, and to the various troops and agencies at 30% cash for the first phase. The rest will be issued when the Ministry of Finance allocates more. In addition, of the long-term payment orders allocated by Minister Song during his tenure, in addition to those that have been discounted at the bank and received on schedule, there are still 6.9 million yuan of payment orders from January 21 to February 3. The Military Supply Department has issued checks on schedule and transferred them to the various troops and agencies for use as expenses. It is hoped that the Ministry of Finance will allocate funds on schedule for these payment orders, so that the checks issued by the Military Supply Department will naturally not cause problems. If the Ministry of Finance has no money to allocate at that time, the check holders will have to register with the Military Supply Department so that they can raise funds and exchange them for cash in installments to avoid losing credit. In addition, the Military Supply Department has been ordered to first allocate half of the cash for the promissory notes received by the Jiangxi bandit suppression troops in December. The Ministry of Finance is also being urged to pay attention to the promissory notes of other troops and agencies and to raise funds in advance to prepare for the phased exchange of cash. Please understand the difficulties and endure to support the situation, commanders of various troops and agencies. We are deeply confident that the central government and all higher-level agencies will be mindful of the plight of our officers and soldiers and will urgently provide relief.

<h3 id="e17">The Bankruptcy of Education and the Responsibility of the Government <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Today, the politics of our country are like a tangled mess, compounded by stagnant water, failing to meet the people's expectations. What is most heartbreaking and most harmful to the foundation of our country is the bankruptcy of education.</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, political corruption, repeated internal strife, cultural decline, backward production, and the decline of education have been major causes. Up to the present, the government still treats education as child's play, as mere decoration to embellish its facade. It is deemed dispensable and of little importance. Therefore, education funds are in arrears year after year, and educational positions are given out indiscriminately. Schools across the country are trapped in a state of stagnation, and education clearly presents a phenomenon of complete bankruptcy.</p>
<p>According to recent newspaper reports, national universities are owed educational funds for as long as half a year. National universities in Peiping and Tianjin are owed a total of 2.4 million yuan. Shen Yinmo, the president of Peking University, and the deans of the seven colleges have simultaneously resigned. Representatives from various universities in Peiping and Tianjin have repeatedly appealed to the government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education, but to no avail. In other capital cities, municipalities, and counties, it is even more common for educators to petition and plead for educational funds. If educational funds are in arrears for as long as half a year, how can schools manage to maintain appearances? How can those engaged in education maintain their livelihoods? Today, our country's finances have repeatedly reduced military spending, yet it still accounts for 18 million yuan, while political expenses are only 4 million. Over the years, public bonds have been issued for a total of 900 million, all of which have been used for military expenses. The country exhausts its resources, plundering the flesh and blood of the people to support the military, and the result is that the territory cannot be defended, and the enemy cannot be resisted. As Mr. Xin Cai Ci Lin Kanghou said the other day, "What the army repays our people with is internal warfare, bandits, communists, and opium." We truly do not understand the government's purpose in exhausting its treasury to support the military, nor do we understand the government's intention in defaulting on educational funds, sitting idly by as schools shut down and education goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>Even worse, according to news from Peiping, Wu Jixu, the president of Beiyang Engineering College, who once went on a hunger strike to appeal for peace, telegraphed Li Shizeng to question the allocation of 100,000 yuan from the Boxer Indemnity funds to send a certain actor to Europe for study. According to news, at the end of last year, several departments each had special income, and civil servants were actually given double salaries. The Boxer Indemnity funds are specifically for subsidizing cultural undertakings. However, the funding of various universities is so difficult that they are about to close their doors, and educators are going hungry while working for the public good, their livelihoods gradually being cut off. Even if it is necessary for a certain actor to go to Europe for study, weighing the importance and urgency, what should the 100,000 yuan be used for first? How can one manipulate it and freely allocate it based on personal preferences? Since both those engaged in politics and those engaged in education serve the country, their treatment should be equal. Now, those engaged in education are going hungry while working for the public good, unable to support themselves, while some of those engaged in politics are receiving double salaries, showing special favor. What is the explanation for this? Such absurd phenomena, which should never occur, are all clear evidence of our government's neglect of education today, leading to its bankruptcy.</p>
<p>This is only in terms of education funding. As for educational administration, it is even more unspeakable. The entire education sector is completely bureaucratized. Those engaged in education do not need to be specialists, nor are their academic qualifications questioned. Educational positions are gifts to curry favor and sinecures to settle private individuals. As a result, important educational positions are left vacant, and the president of Central University is beaten. Utterly disgraceful states and strange phenomena abound, and yet students are blamed for their corrupt academic atmosphere, and choosing teachers and principals is deemed troublemaking. Such phenomena are truly unheard of in the world. Besides feeling heartbroken and indignant, what else can we say?</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a nation and concerns the long-term plan for the country's century. The achievements of education today can be used to judge the order or chaos of the country in the future. The government's neglect of education today, leading to its bankruptcy, will not only cause young people across the country to be out of school, but also deplete the nation's vitality and dig up the nation's lifeblood. Its harm to the country is not only in the present but extends to decades or even centuries later. The importance of the matter is so great. Today, all countries in the world are striving to develop education and cultivate young people as an urgent task. If a country cannot maintain the minimum level of education funding, can its government still be called a government?</p>
<p>We believe that military spending must be reduced today, and education funding must be increased. Moreover, it must be allocated on time. The intrusion of bureaucratic tendencies into the education sector is a fatal hidden danger to education, and it must be resolutely opposed and prevented.</p>
<p>We dare to make a painful and loud appeal, urging our countrymen and the education community to rise up together to save this crisis that is enough to destroy the country and exterminate the race.</p>

Liu's 2,000 troops are willing to travel to Gaotang by train, and the rest are still willing to travel on foot. Zhang Heilian's troops and others, more than 3,000 in the Houshan area of Mengshan, were intercepted by the people's militia and could not gather in Wenkou. They requested that the people's militia in various counties be ordered to let them pass. Because Liu and others surrendered, the momentum of the bandits in various places has diminished and they have no foothold, so they have surrendered with Liu one after another. More than 2,000 of Xue Cuifeng's old troops in Yuncheng have also met with Liu to negotiate. There is hope that the bandits in this province will be completely eliminated. Liu's troops and Guo Maifeng's troops have been temporarily reorganized into one brigade each. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chaojun's plan to reform the capital's municipal administration states that the reorganization of the finances of the capital city in the future should first save administrative expenses and strictly set standards for the use of personnel on the negative side. On the positive side, the reorganization of tax revenue is the most urgent task. However, the capital is not a commercial area and must rely on the assistance of the National Government and various provinces. The water supply alone is short of more than 2 million yuan in funding, and there is also a lack of funding for road repairs. There are currently more than 20,000 young people out of school in the city. The slow progress of the city's construction projects over the years is partly due to the decline of the local economy and partly due to the unstable situation.

<p>The Ruling and Opposition Parties Held a General Meeting Yesterday and Passed a Declaration</p>
<p>Inukai Tsuyoshi Explains Domestic and Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Tokyo Telegram from Kokumin, 20th: The Japanese Diet is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow. Today, various political parties are gathering in Tokyo to deliberate. It is expected that the Diet will be dissolved immediately after reconvening, preventing the Minseitō party from having the opportunity to introduce a no-confidence motion against the government. If dissolved, a general election will be held around the 20th of next month. It is generally expected that before the dissolution, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa will issue a declaration on relations with China, and Finance Minister Takahashi will explain the reasons for lifting the gold embargo.</p>
<p>Tokyo Telegram from Rengo, 20th: The dissolution of the 60th Diet seems inevitable. When it reconvenes on the 21st, the breakdown of the two houses, as investigated by the secretariats of both houses, is as follows: "House of Peers": Imperial Family: 16, Dōseikai: 29, Kenkyūkai: 149, Kōyū Club: 39, Kōseikai: 67, Kayōkai: 31, Dōwakai: 40, Independents: 29, Total: 400 members, 4 vacancies. "House of Representatives": Minseitō: 247, Seiyūkai: 171, Daiichi Kōshitsu: 29, Independents: 3, Total: 450 members, 16 vacancies.</p>
<p>Tokyo Telegram from Dentsu, 20th: The Diet, which is bound to be dissolved, will convene tomorrow. The ruling and opposition parties, as well as the proletarian parties, held general meetings today. The Seiyūkai held its party convention at 1:00 PM today. Prime Minister Inukai, cabinet members, Diet members, branch members, and over 300 others attended, passed a declaration and resolutions. Prime Minister Inukai rose to express the attitude and policy of the current cabinet. The content of the declaration included the re-implementation of the gold export ban, an industrial nation policy, reform of the education system, and resolution of the Manchuria-Mongolia problem.</p>
<p>Tokyo Telegram from Rengo, 20th: The Seiyūkai convention was held this afternoon. Advisor Mochizuki read the following speech by President Inukai: "Last winter, I respectfully received the imperial mandate and assumed the great responsibility of forming a cabinet. After forming the cabinet, I immediately implemented a ban on gold exports and suspended convertibility to prevent the depletion of specie, which invigorated the economy. This is truly gratifying. Unexpectedly, an unfortunate incident occurred, and I submitted my resignation. Now that I have been persuaded to remain, I will make extraordinary efforts to improve the nation's fortunes. Regarding the Manchuria-Mongolia issue, it is not only the trend of national opinion, but also a clear understanding that national self-determination is the common international principle of the present time. Respect for existing international treaties in the Manchurian region goes without saying, and opening the door wide to make it a place of residence for both domestic and foreign people is an opportunity for peace in the Far East. In short, in the face of the current extraordinary situation, the nation must have an extraordinary awakening. The responsibility for overcoming the current national crisis rests entirely on the shoulders of our party. As we approach the reconvening of the Diet, I deeply hope that you will work harder and devote yourselves to the nation."</p>
<p>Tokyo Telegram from Dentsu, 20th: The Minseitō party also held a party convention today, passing a declaration and resolutions. President Wakatsuki gave a speech on the issue of propriety concerning the incident and the re-implementation of the gold export ban, expressing the attitude of the opposition party. It is also reported that President Wakatsuki will, in the form of an urgent question at the Diet session tomorrow, raise the issue of propriety concerning the Sakuradamon Incident and question Prime Minister Inukai. A heated debate between Inukai and Wakatsuki is expected.</p>

<p>Tokyo Telegram from Reuters, 20th: This morning, Tokyo police clashed with 1,000 students from Tokyo Imperial University. The students organized a demonstration, demanding student autonomy and an end to police surveillance. During the demonstration, some students were carrying red flags, and plainclothes police attempted to arrest them, leading to a scuffle. The police eventually arrested two demonstration leaders. Although the students tried hard to rescue those arrested, they were unsuccessful. Traffic in front of the university was completely blocked at the time.</p>

<p>US Refuses to Extend Hoover Moratorium Plan</p>
<p>The Lausanne Conference May Fall Through</p>
<p>Paris Telegram from Kokumin, 19th: With less than a week remaining until the scheduled opening of the Lausanne reparations conference, the French government clearly declared today that it cannot renounce its right to receive reparations. When Prime Minister Laval delivered the new cabinet's policy statement to the National Assembly, he stated that France could not accept solutions to the reparations issue and the limitation of armaments issue that would strike at the integrity of France's rights and vital interests. These rights are confirmed by freely signed treaties. The French nation has a responsibility to the people who have experienced war and to future generations. This responsibility will not allow it to renounce its right to reparations, and so on. Laval's position is in stark contrast to German Chancellor Brüning's statement that Germany is unable to pay reparations any longer. The international conference to be convened in Lausanne next week will reconsider the entire reparations issue in light of the current global economic situation. Laval's declaration is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Washington Telegram from Reuters, 19th: The US government today instructed its ambassador to France, Edge, to inform French Prime Minister Laval that Europe must solve its debt problems itself, without US intervention.</p>
<p>Paris Telegram from Reuters, 19th: Officials here today confirmed that French Prime Minister Laval had indeed inquired of US Ambassador Edge whether the US would agree to extend the Hoover moratorium plan for another six months or a year. At the time this telegram was sent, Edge had not yet received a formal reply from the State Department, but Edge stated to guests that the US clearly opposes extending the moratorium plan. The Allied countries do not have any debts to the US due on December 15th of this year, so in effect, the moratorium plan will be extended for five and a half months until mid-December. Moreover, the US presidential election will be held in November, and the US attitude will naturally be affected by the election results. According to a Reuters telegram from Washington, the US government's reply essentially stated that Europe must find its own solutions. Although the US has not completely closed its door and refused to make further concessions, Washington believes that European debtor nations must first restore their own credit before requesting continued debt relief.</p>
<p>London Telegram from Kokumin, 20th: As a result of the declaration made yesterday by French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval in the Chamber of Deputies, London newspapers this morning stated that the Lausanne reparations conference would fall through. The newspapers also stated that they had previously warned British cabinet members not to travel to Lausanne to avoid a futile journey. It is generally believed that the Lausanne conference will likely become a formal meeting of experts from various countries to study the report of the special advisory committee appointed by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<p>Madrid Telegram from Reuters, 19th: The strike wave is still spreading throughout Spain, and the situation is serious. The cabinet held a special meeting today to consider ways to restore normalcy. After hearing a report from the Minister of the Interior on the disruption of public order by extremists on both sides, the cabinet decided to severely punish those who disrupt order according to law and to adopt necessary plans to prevent disturbances, such as invoking the Republic's Security Law. This afternoon, the National Assembly met and questioned the government about the strikes and riots. Bilbao held a general strike today, with all shops closed and no one on the streets. Residents were afraid to go out. Except for doctors passing through the streets in cars with white flags, all means of transportation were suspended. The prevalence of the strike is unprecedented. The number of people arrested has increased to fifty-five today. Workers in Galicia today followed the example of Barcelona, Valencia, and Madrid and also announced a province-wide general strike to take effect from tomorrow. Madrid Debate, an important Catholic newspaper, has suspended publication indefinitely because it published an editorial criticizing the government's handling of the labor unrest. Today, twenty-five bandits attempted to detain a train from Bilbao to Madrid. Fortunately, a militia team arrived and the bandits scattered, but fifteen were captured.</p>

<p>Dawes Appointed President of Finance Corporation</p>
<p>Washington Telegram from Reuters, 19th: President Hoover has appointed Secretary of State Stimson as the US chief delegate to the Geneva Disarmament Conference, which shows the US President's importance attached to this conference. The US chief delegate was originally General Dawes, but today officials suddenly announced that the government-established Finance Reconstruction Corporation, which was established to help industrial recovery, has appointed Dawes as the corporation's president, so he cannot go to Geneva. Stimson joined President Hoover's cabinet as Secretary of State in March 1929. He is 64 years old and a graduate of both Yale and Harvard Universities. He practiced law and served as Secretary of War under President Taft in 1911 and as Governor-General of the Philippines in 1927. Dawes also studied Germany's ability to pay war debts and reparations in 1924 and created the Dawes Plan, which made him world-famous.</p>

At the same time, based on the resolutions of the Fourth National Congress accepted by the First Plenary Session, the Southwest Executive Department of the Central Executive Committee and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government were established to assume the responsibility of balanced governance under the guidance of the Central Government, and to handle all follow-up matters after the conclusion. The aforementioned bodies urgently need to be established, and the reasons for their establishment and the provisional outline regulations have been reported to the Central Government for review and approval. As for the Military Affairs Branch, because the Central Government has not established a Military Affairs Committee, it will temporarily not be established in accordance with the intentions of the Central Government. However, outsiders do not understand and make many conjectures, even saying that the interception of customs revenue is harmful to the separatist Southwest. Groundless rumors are adding to the confusion and creating chaos, and we are deeply afraid of confusing the public and leading to unrest. Therefore, we hereby solemnly declare once again that in this time of national crisis, we and our colleagues are determined to support the Central Government with utmost sincerity and overcome the national crisis together.

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the fall of Jinzhou, all of our troops have retreated into Shanhaiguan. All land and political power outside the customs has been occupied by the Japanese. The Guandong section of the Beining Railway accounts for three-quarters of the entire line, including the Datong branch line, Gouying branch line, Jinzhou branch line, and Yingkou Wharf and Huludao Port, which the Japanese have long coveted. Now that they have occupied it by force, they are vigorously managing it. The puppet Fengtian Provincial Government has appointed Kan Duo as the director of the Guandong section and renamed the Guandong section of the Beining Railway the Fengshan Railway. At the same time, the six million yuan in cash that the former Beining Railway had stored in Shenyang (this money was for the development of Huludao Port and construction of a harbor, but it was seized by the Japanese after the September 18th Incident) has been withdrawn to be used to buy off our Chinese employees at various stations. Now Kan Duo has established a temporary office of the Fengshan Railway in the Transportation Bank building at the Japanese station and is carrying out official business. On the other hand, a large number of personnel have been dispatched along the line, claiming that employees of the Guandong section who have left their posts will be paid three months' salary in advance as an incentive if they report to the office before the 19th. Those who do not report after the deadline will be dismissed. The announcement issued by Kan Duo is copied below: "I have been appointed by the Fengtian Provincial Government as the Director of the Fengshan Railway Administration. I have taken office today. Since the incident, the officials of this railway have maintained it with great effort. Recently, due to military relations, many have left their posts, resulting in a standstill in transportation and business. The Director of this Bureau is tasked with handling all affairs of the entire railway, with the primary goal of restoring the original state. All original employees and workers in all parts of this railway must be at ease and continue to serve as usual. Those who have temporarily left their posts must return to their original posts within ten days and report to the Bureau. Those who do not report after the deadline will be dismissed without leniency. You must obey. Director Kan Duo, January 9th."</p>

All work of the municipal party headquarters will be suspended until further orders from the Central Government. 2. Each staff member of the party headquarters will first be paid two months' salary as a relief fund, and the party headquarters will be temporarily dissolved pending a recall order. 3. Publication of the Minguo Daily has been temporarily suspended due to excessive losses, and the date of resumption of publication will be determined later. The staff and workers of the newspaper will be paid one and a half months' salary and dismissed. 4. The National News Agency will also be temporarily suspended and the staff will be paid two months' salary. After the above measures were decided, the salaries were paid out today and the municipal party headquarters has been dissolved. As for the executive and supervisory committee members, they will await orders from the Central Government before making a decision.</p>
<p>Also, it has been widely rumored in the city recently that the Japanese person, Doihara, secretly came to Qingdao a few days ago and will carry out further activities. The citizens talk about it with great fear, and the people are quite uneasy these days. The Japanese expatriates are also scheduled to hold a meeting of expatriates at the residential group tomorrow, and it is feared that there will be another conspiracy. Because of the Japanese burning down the municipal party headquarters, the municipal government has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese consul in Qingdao. After three days, the Japanese consul has not yet replied. It is reported that the municipal government will file a second protest (January 17th).</p>
<h3 id="e77">Shandong Audit Office Still Belongs to the Central Government <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Result of Belsons' Negotiations in Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Han Fuju took over the national tax agencies, he sent Li Wuchen to act as the Shandong Salt Transport Department Tax Police, which was taken over from the audit office. Jiao Zilong was appointed as the team leader and Chai Dongsheng was appointed as the manager of the Shandong Salt Affairs Audit Branch and went to take over. The manager of the office, Li Zhifan, immediately handed over the office to the deputy manager, an Englishman, Buske, who raised an objection due to the loan contract relationship and telegraphed the Salt Affairs Audit General Office to request instructions. The general office then sent the former director of the Shandong Audit Office, an Englishman, Belson, and special commissioner Zeng Yangfeng to Jinan to negotiate with Han Fuju at the provincial government on the 18th. Belson explained the purpose of his visit and said that the government also understood Shandong's financial difficulties very well, but the audit office, customs, and postal service have always been managed uniformly by the central government, and the system should not be disrupted. The audit office has achieved remarkable results. The salt tax in the early years was only 20 million yuan, but last year it has increased to 160 million yuan, which is of great importance to the central government's finances. If it is transferred to the jurisdiction of the provincial government, tax revenue may be affected, and Shandong should not be different from the rest of the country. The tax police were not originally managed by the audit office, but after the audit office took over due to rampant corruption, there has been some improvement, and it is hoped that they will still be managed by the audit office. As for the tax funds, after deducting foreign debts and the expenses of the audit office, the remaining funds will be temporarily left in Shandong to replenish military expenditures, and the original situation will be restored after the central government funds can be issued. In this way, both the central administrative system and the local difficulties in Shandong can be taken into account. Otherwise, if this precedent is set, other places may follow suit. Han said that he has always supported unification, and this time the borrowing of central tax funds was a last resort. After the central government funds arrive and military expenditures can be issued, the national tax agencies will be immediately returned. The audit office can still order the former director Li Zhifan to be reinstated, and Chai Dongsheng will be appointed as the team leader of the tax police brigade, which will still be under the jurisdiction of the audit office. The tax funds (i.e., surplus salt revenue) will be temporarily borrowed. This negotiation was then resolved. Belson, Zeng Yangfeng, and others are scheduled to go to Yantai in the coming days. It is reported that the Yantai tax police can also still be managed by the audit office (January 19th).</p>
<h3 id="e78">Liu Yin and Other Units Meet in Wenkou <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>They Will Soon Be Sent to Gaotang and Chiping to Await Registration</p>
<p>8,000-Year-Old Zhang Heilian and Other Units Also Surrender</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Guitang, Guo Wensheng, Yin Shixi, and other units stationed in Dawenkou had previously requested an extension to be sent to Gaotang. After Yin Shigui, Song Chaosheng, and other units stationed in the Nanshan area arrived at Wenkou, they will be sent to Gaotang and Chiping at the same time to await registration. Yin Shigui and other units arrived at Nanshahe near Tengxian on the 16th. Because it took time to gather more than 1,000 people in the unit, it was not until yesterday afternoon that the gathering was completed. For the sake of speed, they boarded the train in Nanshahe and came north. According to a telephone report from Dawenkou, Yin Shigui, Song Chaosheng, and other units arrived in Dawenkou early this morning (the 18th) and met with Liu, Guo, and other units. Currently, three empty trains are parked at Dawenkou Station waiting for the Liu, Yin, and Guo units to board the train and depart as promised. Also, Liu Guitang telegraphed the provincial government chairman Han Fuju on the 16th, stating that the unit has been rushing to make rosters and rough compilation since the 16th and that Division Commander Gu (Liangmin) arrived in Wenkou on the 14th to announce the virtues and intentions, and everyone was happy and grateful. Han telegraphed again on the 18th, ordering him to handle the compilation of rosters and other matters after arriving in Gaotang.</p>
<p>Also, according to a telephone call from Dawenkou, after Yin Shigui's unit arrived at Nanshahe near Tengxian, they took a train north yesterday and arrived at Dawenkou at 4:00 AM this morning (the 18th) and got off the train to meet with Liu Guitang and other units, and then stationed near Wenkou. The number of people in the unit is more than 1,200 (including 600 people from Guo Wensheng's unit). Liu's representative Xia Ziming had previously gone to Nanshahe to meet Yin's unit and also returned to Dawenkou by train today. Currently, there are more than 5,000 people in various units in Wenkou. Liu Guitang said that after all the military uniforms are issued, they will depart for Gaotang and Chiping for registration and reorganization. Empty trains are still parked at the station waiting. Liu's liaison officer Li Ziming called Yanzhou today from Wenkou, asking the 22nd Division Commander Gu Liangmin to send an adjutant to Jinan tomorrow (the 19th) to collect the military uniforms and return to Wenkou to actively prepare for departure. Liu Guitang has also scheduled to send someone to Gaotang and Chiping in the coming days to discuss defense issues and to contact the remaining bandits in Gaotang, including 8,000-year-olds (bandit nickname), to surrender and listen to Liu's orders. However, Zhang Heilian's unit of more than 3,000 people in Yishui Mountain originally agreed to gather at Dawenkou to surrender, but Liu Guitang, Guo Wensheng, Yin Shigui, Yin Shixi, Song Chaosheng, and other units arrived, Zhang Heilian's unit was intercepted by the Yishui militia and could not pass. Liu Guitang's representative Xia Ziming will come to Jinan again tomorrow to meet Han and request that the militias and joint villages of various counties be ordered to release them so that they can be sent to Gaotang for registration and to clear the banditry (January 18th).</p>
<h3 id="e79">Dispute Between Hebei Anti-Drug Association and Party Department <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Party Department Bans the Work of the Anti-Drug Association</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The northern part of Hebei Province borders Rehe, and the southern part borders Henan, both of which are opium producing areas. In addition, there are many local opium dealers in this province, so opium is extremely prevalent. Last year, the China National Anti-Drug Association entrusted Cao Hongzhu to come to Tianjin to advocate the establishment of the Hebei Provincial National Anti-Drug Branch to seek the eradication of opium. All circles unanimously agreed and elected Cao Hongzhu, Zhou Zhaoxiang, Wang Wendian, Leng Jiaji, Zhang Zhongyuan, Sun Fengzao, Zhu Qinghua, Wu Chengshi, Wu Aichen, Chen Mingjian, Liu Mengyang, Li Quan, Gao Xingya, Su Rongquan, Li Jinghu, and Chen Xisan as committee members, and Cao Hongzhu as chairman. The organization was legally established in May and was issued a certificate by the Tianjin Municipal Party Department and approved and filed by the Provincial Government. It was formally established on June 24. At that time, the Provincial Party Department specially sent Wang Renmin to attend the swearing-in ceremony, so the organization of the association was sound in accordance with the organizational plan. In the past six months, in addition to carrying out propaganda, investigation, and reporting, it has also strived to advocate anti-drug activities in accordance with the organizational outline of the General Association and has successively obtained the initiation of the organization of county branches in various counties to cooperate with the provincial branch to eradicate the drug disaster. However, the opium disaster in Hebei is rampant and its momentum is overwhelming. Although the provincial government has strictly prohibited it and issued strict orders, some corrupt officials have colluded to make a profit. Not only do they turn a deaf ear to the provincial orders, but they even regard the anti-drug associations of the public as hindering their actions and use all kinds of threats and obstacles. Therefore, on December 28, 20th year, the provincial government ordered all cities and counties to effectively assist the Hebei Provincial Anti-Drug Branch. Unexpectedly, just as the letters were being distributed, the Hebei Provincial Party Department issued a notice to the party departments of various counties, saying that the Hebei Provincial Anti-Drug Branch had not been approved to organize at all. How could it organize county branches in various counties? It was ordered to be banned, etc. The provincial branch, when the organization was first established, had reported to the party and government organs in the location for guidance and filing. The opening of the meeting also had representatives of the party department present to participate. How could the facts be erased and arbitrarily destroyed? Moreover, the party department should be in a guiding position. How can it oppress public opinion and forcibly stop the assembly? People have absolute freedom in law, as stipulated in the provisional constitution. How can it be destroyed? The provincial party department does not understand its position and abuses its power, which not only violates Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of civil rights, but also borders on autocratic behavior. Moreover, when the country is in trouble, anti-drug is the foundation of strengthening the people. All Chinese citizens should work together to save the country from ruin. Therefore, the association has replied to the provincial party department with a letter based on the above reasons and telegraphed the Nanjing Central Party Department, asking it to quickly stop the actions of the provincial party department in order to maintain the ban on opium (January 17th).</p>

<p>Partial Exemption of Grain Tribute and Additional Levies: The Ministry of Finance had previously approved a one-year extension for the additional levy of two yuan per stone of grain tribute. Now, the provincial Department of Finance has issued a general order to its subordinate financial bureaus to continue collecting the additional levy this year according to the previous plan. The head of the Local Products Management Office of this county, Lu Longxiang, Cai Guangyao, and others, had telegraphed the ministry and province, requesting consideration of the poor harvest and the people's difficulties, and exemption from the additional levy. Subsequently, a reply was received from the Ministry of Finance, stating: "The submission has been reviewed. The case of Jiangsu Province's application for a one-year extension of the additional grain levy had been repeatedly submitted to the Executive Yuan's Secretariat in April of the 20th year, which forwarded it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting that the two yuan additional grain levy from the 19th year be extended for one year within the 20th-year budget. This ministry had separately listed the reasons for not approving the extension and requested that the original plan be maintained. Subsequently, a letter was received from the Executive Yuan's Secretariat, forwarded to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, again requesting a one-year extension of the two yuan additional grain levy. Furthermore, since this case had been repeatedly submitted by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and is now during the period of bandit suppression, it seems feasible to proceed accordingly. However, Jiangsu Province's land tax is notoriously heavy, with additional levies on top of the regular tax. During this one-year extension period, each county must not add any additional levies under the land tax item. After the expiration of the period, the provincial government must not request a renewal under any pretext." This ministry has ordered the Jiangsu Department of Finance to comply with the above, which should be noted.</p>
<p>Designation of Liaison Defense Office Specialist: The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Pacification Supervisor had previously ordered this county to organize a joint defense office with nine counties, including Wuxian, in the lakeside area in order to eliminate bandits. The county convened a meeting once to discuss the establishment of an office in Wuxian. Each county dispatched a specialist to handle the office affairs regularly. The county magistrate of this county, Shen, immediately appointed Zhu Zhangqi, the section chief of the first section, as the specialist to the office, and he promptly went to take up his post.</p>

<p>Philanthropic Elder Robbed in Hometown: Zhu Qingquan, a philanthropic elder and head of Guanzhuang Village in his hometown of Su, had his home broken into by five robbers on the night of the previous day. They each carried handguns, broke into the house, and ransacked it. They also robbed the homes of neighbors Zhu Hequi and Zhu Jinsheng, taking away about five or six hundred yuan in losses.</p>
<p>Seven Accomplices Transferred to High Court: Seven communist suspects, Cai Fei, Xu Huishan, Li Asheng, Jiang Zhixing, Yu Ailin, and the female suspect Tang Xuelan, were captured by the Songhu Garrison Command and transferred to the Nanjing Military and Political Department, and then to the Jiangning District Court.

<p>Pork Merchant's Debt Collection Resembles Kidnapping: Mao Fuquan, the manager of Yida Pork Shop outside the North Gate's Little Three Mile Bridge, is from Taixing. He has a penchant for vices, which has led to accumulated debts, owing more than a thousand yuan to customers. Last month, Mao absconded without a trace due to his inability to maintain the business. Zhao Laojiu, a pork merchant from Taixing, was also owed more than five hundred yuan. On the second day of the twelfth lunar month, Zhao came to Wuxi and tricked Chen Wenrong, an apprentice at Yida Pork Shop, into going to Yuecheng Bridge in Jiangyin, where they boarded a ferry directly to Zhao's home in Taixing County. He had people watch over Chen, forbidding him from going out, resembling a kidnapping. He also forced Chen Wenrong to write a letter to Chen's uncle-in-law, Ren Junfa, to borrow 150 yuan to be delivered to Zhu Zhentai's woodworking shop in the South City of Wuxi. After receiving the letter, Ren did not reply. The day before yesterday afternoon, Zhao Laojiu sent his accomplice, Liu Dengji, to Wuxi to borrow money from Ren Junfa, hoping to redeem Chen Wenrong and return him to Wuxi. Ren, seeing the situation, immediately handed Liu over to the First Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, who transferred him to the Public Security Bureau yesterday for investigation.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Large Quantity of Enemy Goods: The Inspection Team of the Inspection Department of the County's All-Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association seized 73 pounds of white lead screws, 15 pounds of magnetic clamping boards, and 11 magnetic bowls at Zhenyuan Hardware Store on the road yesterday and the day before yesterday. They also seized 70 pounds of white magnetic clamping boards at Zhenhua Hardware Store. Furthermore, they seized three flower sports shirts at Ruiyuanyuyang Foreign Goods Store outside the West Gate. At Qinyuzhuang in Beitang, they seized eight pieces of foreign-labeled cloth, one piece of Yuan velvet, one bolt of Shilin cloth, one piece of red foreign yarn, two pieces of white foreign yarn, four pieces of green foreign yarn, and four pieces of black foreign yarn, among other enemy goods. All were taken to the association for identification.</p>

<p>Bean Boat Robbed on Outer City River: Boatman Yang Yuhe had a boatload of beans moored on the outer city riverbank outside the South Gate of Cao Yan. Yesterday at noon, six or seven bandits suddenly appeared, speaking with a northern accent, each holding wooden sticks and handguns. They swarmed onto the boat, silenced everyone, entered the cabin to ransack, and injured Yang's mother, Zhang, on the head and arms. They then abducted Yang's two young daughters and declared before leaving that a ransom of 1,000 yuan was required.</p>

<p>Headquarters Interrogates Robbers of Dada Steamer: The Dada Steamer of the Shanghai-Yangzhou route was robbed in the Jiangmian waters of Liuwei Port in November of last year, resulting in significant losses. After investigations by Huang Bingzhong, the captain of the Detective Team of the Suchang Pacification Headquarters, it was discovered that Yan Linlin, a key suspect in the case, from Weitang, Changzhou, had partnered with others to rob the Dada Steamer. He had since been appointed as a patrol ship cabin chief in the 8th Anti-Smuggling Brigade of Suzhou. He was immediately arrested and brought to the headquarters. On the 18th, after being questioned by Chief Zhu, he was transferred to the County Government for detention. Another suspect, Geng, is scheduled to be brought to the headquarters for interrogation on the 19th.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications' Ban on Private Postal Bureaus: The Ministry of Communications ordered that all private postal bureaus be shut down by the end of the 20th year. The Jiangyin Quansheng and other postal bureaus had submitted a request to the Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Ministry of Communications, requesting an extension of the closure period for ten years. The Ministry of Communications replied that the postal service is a state-run enterprise, and the ministry has already been lenient in allowing private postal bureaus to operate with registered licenses. The submission states that the general delivery of letters to the post office is slow, and merchants and the public must send them through private bureaus, leaving the private bureaus without business. This is a misunderstanding. The temporary regulations for private bureaus' registered licenses stipulate that if a location from which or to which a letter is sent does not have a post office or a postal kiosk, or another village or town postal delivery service, the private bureau is still allowed to deliver the letter themselves. It is not required that all letters be delivered to the post office for general delivery. Therefore, the ministry has already considered both the operation and the livelihood of the merchants and the public. If the private bureaus register with the post office, they can continue to operate within the aforementioned scope. There is no need to discuss the request for a ten-year extension.</p>

<p>Salt City's Transported Bank Funds Robbed: Qianzhuang in Yancheng, such as Fushun and Jitailong, have always had dealings with the qianzhuang in the town. As the end of the lunar year is approaching, the outstanding debts must be settled. Liu Er, a boatman from Yan Yi Kai Zhen, was entrusted to transport 11,000 yuan in cash to Zhenbu to collect debts from the qianzhuang. The boat has always transported the cash without any mistakes. Unexpectedly, one day after departure, it suddenly returned to Yancheng. Liu Erqing reported that the boat was sailing near Wenyuanpu in Xinghua when a small boat carrying bandits approached. The bandits stole 10,000 yuan from the boat, but 1,000 yuan was not stolen because it was well-hidden. Upon hearing the news, the qianzhuang immediately reported to Xu Yuhua, the chairman of the industry association, and telegraphed Xinghua, requesting an investigation. County Magistrate Hua of Xinghua immediately ordered Zheng Bocheng, the captain of the detective team, to investigate. After a detailed inspection, the boat owner, Liu Erqing, was suspected of being involved, so he went to Yancheng to consult with Chairman Xu to facilitate the arrest. The Yancheng County Government also assigned detectives Xu Haikui and others to Zhen to investigate, hoping to solve the case as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Promoting Emancipation 丨 Improving Normal Schools</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. on the 19th of this month, Zhou Fohai, the Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, convened a meeting of provincial middle school principals in the auditorium of the department. The situation is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e88">Principals in Attendance <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>

<p>After Zhou Fohai, the chairman, performed the formalities, Zhou made a brief report, stating that his coming to Jiangsu to lead education was somewhat forced, especially as he was not very familiar with the situation in Jiangsu. Therefore, it was necessary to meet with everyone to discuss everything. The Education Department is like a machine, and for this machine to function, the Education Department and the schools must work together to devise common plans and solve economic difficulties. He hopes that the resolutions made in the past can be fully implemented, as they are often resolved but not implemented, or are too idealistic and difficult to execute. He saw the resolutions from everyone's meeting in the newspaper the other day, and they are all very practical. The Education Department is currently preparing several discussion topics to exchange opinions. Since everyone has met with Chairman Gu, they also feel that funding is a difficult issue. He is willing to be everyone's vanguard regarding funding, and will not be deterred by any difficulties. He also hopes that everyone will work together, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Section Chief Hou's Report <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Next, Section Chief Hou reported: ㈠ Regarding the submission to the Central Government for additional funding for National Central University: It has been found that the educational funding in this province is extremely strained and must be remedied urgently. It was previously submitted to the 463rd meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, which resolved to transfer the cigarette tax in Jiangsu Province to the Ministry of Finance and Education for the funding of National Central University, and that all income from the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office from January 21st onwards would be used to supplement the Provincial Education Funding for maintenance, etc. This was also submitted separately to the Provincial Government. It was previously reported that the Executive Yuan's meeting on January 12th resolved that the Central University's maintenance funding of 1.32 million would be permanently provided by the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office. This was discussed at the 27th Education Funding Committee meeting on January 13th. It was resolved that the Provincial Government should continue to strongly advocate to the Central Government and that, as both Central University and Provincial Education funding are facing difficulties, they should jointly request relief from the Executive Yuan and discuss the solution after the results are obtained. ㈡ Regarding the relief of the current financial difficulties of provincial education in order to maintain operations: It has been found that this year's provincial educational funding has been severely impacted by the famine, and all agencies have been in arrears with their regular expenses for several months, facing extreme hardship. If relief is not sought quickly, operations will be suspended. The 27th Education Funding Committee previously resolved to maintain provincial educational funding before December of the 20th year, awaiting the return of the Director of the Finance Department to the province to discuss whether to temporarily borrow and pledge securities or temporarily transfer other funds for relief, etc. The department is currently working with the management office to find ways to provide urgent relief. As for the shortfall in revenue and expenditure for the entire year, including previous accumulated losses, the management office reports that it amounts to 2.4 million yuan. How to seek relief will be proposed for discussion at the next Education Funding Committee meeting. ㈢ Regarding the examination and selection of current employees of provincial educational institutions to study abroad: In order to increase the efficiency of educational services, the department submitted a proposal to the 464th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, which resolved to examine and select current employees of provincial educational institutions to study abroad from the 21st year onwards. The department is currently preparing a detailed plan for implementation.</p>
<p>The items for discussion today include four: ㈠ Studying the implementation of moral education policies in order to rectify the academic atmosphere and eliminate student unrest; ㈡ Studying the implementation of the Ministry-promulgated junior and senior high school curriculum standards; ㈢ Studying how vocational education should be promoted and improved; ㈣ Studying how normal school education should be improved.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Zheng Xigu's Speech <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Xigu, the principal of Shanghai Middle School, stated that since the director has taken office, there has been a very good phenomenon of rapid progress in Jiangsu education. He feels very fortunate to be able to gather with the director today to discuss matters. He hopes that ㈠ the department will consider the opinions of each school in its plans; ㈡ the department will support each school in complying with and carrying out its plans; ㈢ he requests that the department provide a practical discussion today regarding the issues of rectifying the academic atmosphere, normal school independence, and resolving financial difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Discussion of Various Matters <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>㈠ Regarding the financial issue, Zhang Haicheng first reported on the situation of stating to Sun Ke, the President of the Executive Yuan, that the Executive Yuan could no longer order the change of law to have Jiangsu permanently bear the expenses of Central University. Sun agreed that the government would never issue illegal orders. He also asked the Ministry of Education to submit a reconsideration to the Executive Yuan to cancel the previous resolution that the expenses of Central University would be permanently allocated from Jiangsu. He hopes that the department will ask the provincial government to realize the resolution. Next, Zhou Fohai said that he would do his best to address the financial problem, no matter how much Central University opposes it, Jiangsu must maintain the implementation of the resolution, and if necessary, he will propose a remedy at the provincial government, which will be used for education and not for raising soldiers.</p>
<p>㈡ Studying the implementation of moral education policies in order to rectify the academic atmosphere and eliminate student unrest, Director Zhou started by saying that the motivation for proposing this case is that education is currently too unstable. If we do not start with rectifying the academic atmosphere, education is equivalent to nothing. His personal opinion is to proceed from three points: (1) He plans to go to Beijing, Shanghai, and various counties in Jiangbei in early February to give practical lectures to students on the path they should take in the future. (2) He asks the faculty and staff of each school to assist the principal in participating in student groups to lead students to work together. (3) Hold a lecture every week to study the Northeast issue in Japan.</p>
<p>Next, President Ren of Zhenjiang Middle School, President of Shanghai Middle School, President Zhou of Middle School, President Tao of Beijing Women's Middle School, President Zhang of Nanjing Middle School, and the academics presented their views. The main points: (1) Central politics must be on track, and the student unrest in national universities must be eliminated first; (2) The Education Department must assist middle school principals in dealing with student unrest; (3) The Party Department must have a unified method for student organizations; (4) The student self-government association cannot exceed the school's management; (5) In addition to Party doctrine, civic education must be compulsory; (6) Each subject must be centered on the Three Principles of the People, and there is no need to make the Three Principles of the People a separate subject, which would make students feel pointless due to the lack of competent teachers; (7) Faculty and staff must participate in students' national salvation movement and fulfill their responsibilities of protection, guidance, and restraint.</p>

The main points of the discussion, which lasted about an hour, were: (1) The 300,000 yuan in educational funds subsidized by the provincial government each year should be allocated this year by borrowing or paying with 300,000 yuan of Dasheng Yarn Factory stock, or by allocating payments from the counties, and should be distributed evenly each month thereafter; (2) Order the finance bureaus of each county not to transfer or divert special education funds to other uses in the future.</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wang Xi'en, the chairman of the Department of Heavenly Calculation at Qilu University in Jinan, was a world-renowned expert in heavenly calculation. He had studied heavenly calculation for more than forty years, and his depth of knowledge was rare in China. His published works include more than ten kinds such as Practical Astronomy, Gougu Yandai Illustrated Explanation, Trigonometry, Physical Calculus, Radio Science, Radio Science Principles, etc. His recent invention of a new algorithm for graphically calculating solar eclipses has been spread throughout Europe and America, and has been highly regarded by heavenly calculation experts in various countries. Astronomical journals from various countries have competed to publish his works, and his name has become widely known in Europe and America. The Paris World Astronomical Society has sent a special letter inviting him to join the society (the members of the society are all world-renowned heavenly calculation experts). He passed away on the morning of January 13th due to overwork. All those who had heard of his name were shocked and grieved by this sad news. The sudden passing of such a mentor in the scientific community is not only a misfortune for one school or one country, but for the world. It is reported that the school, in order to honor the senior, will suspend classes and lower the flag to half-mast on the day of his funeral (January 23rd) to show their condolences.</p>

<p>With February 6th approaching, the Shanghai-Hong Kong inter-port football match is about to cause a sensation. The selection of players for the Shanghai and Hong Kong teams and the outcome of the match are all topics of speculation. According to reliable sources from Hong Kong, the list of Hong Kong team members coming to Shanghai is as follows. It is said that their strength is better than in previous years.</p>

<p>The inter-port football competition originated in 1908 with matches between Western teams from Shanghai and Hong Kong. The competition was suspended for ten years due to the outbreak of the European War in 1913. In 1913, the Shanghai Western team defeated the Hong Kong team 2-1 in overtime. The official inter-port competition began in 1923 with the Hong Kong Telegraph Cup. Hankou joined the following year, and the Shanghai-Hong Kong final ended in a draw. Shanghai won the replay 1-0 and took the silver cup. Hong Kong won the following year, and the two teams took turns winning until Shanghai won two consecutive years starting the year before last. In total, Shanghai has won seven times and Hong Kong four times.</p>

<p>Since the separation of the Chinese and Hong Kong clubs in Hong Kong this year, no Chinese players will participate in this trip to Shanghai.

<h3 id="e112">Right and Wrong (Part 1) <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Mencius said, "The heart of right and wrong is possessed by all men." Physiologists and psychologists have dissected and experimented on the human brain thousands of times, but have yet to find a specific area responsible for right and wrong.</p>
<p>Right and wrong are merely symbols used to judge behavior. The ability to make these judgments is acquired through experience. It is a skill learned in practical life, not an innate sense of morality or ability.</p>
<p>In practical life, people assign a certain symbol to a certain behavior without any ambiguity. Over time, it becomes second nature. What is right will be called right, and what is wrong will be called wrong, without any discrepancy. If, in practical life, someone confuses black and white, calls a deer a horse, sometimes calling what is right wrong and what is wrong right, then right and wrong cannot be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>Why should right and wrong be reversed? Generally, when seeking personal gain, people do not want right and wrong to be clear. Only when they suffer a slight loss do they loudly demand that others distinguish between right and wrong. "Right and wrong" is the enemy of those who seek advantage. "Knowing right and wrong" is the call for help from those who suffer losses. People cannot always seek advantage, nor can they always suffer losses. Therefore, sometimes they want right and wrong, and sometimes they do not.</p>
<p>Jingjie Gong (Tao Yuanming) has a poem that says, "Glory and decline are not fixed, but shared between us." Can "right" belong exclusively to me? Can "wrong" always belong to others?</p>
<p>Right and wrong are like chastity. Once they are waved away, how can they be summoned back at will?</p>
<h3 id="e113">Lu Zhengxiang's Concern for the Motherland <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Ruogu</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Lu Zhengxiang was a pioneer in China's diplomatic circles. Diplomats Gu Weijun, Wang Zhengting, Wu Chaoshu, Chen Youren, and Shi Zhaoji were all his disciples. When he was stationed in Belgium in his later years, he lost his wife and joined the Benedictine Order of the Catholic Church as a monk. This spring, he will be promoted to the priesthood. Although Lu resides overseas, he is concerned about his motherland. Recently, in view of the difficult national situation and thorny diplomatic issues, he wrote to the Pope in Rome, appealing for blessings on China. He also prays for China three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, in the church. His letters to the country all have specially made postal stamp-style seals, printed with the words "Millions of Hearts, Do Not Forget National Humiliation." This shows a glimpse of Lu's patriotic enthusiasm. Last winter, Lu wrote to the 93-year-old Ma Xiangbo. The original text is recorded as follows: "Joseph, my teacher, is by my side. I received your handwritten letter last month. Reading it, I was overjoyed and could not sleep. It proves that your health has recovered, which is a great joy. I deeply regret that the national situation is difficult, more so than today. The suffering of the people is also greater than today. Although Xiang resides in a monastery, he must cherish his motherland. Recalling the teachings of my late teacher Xu Wensu, looking around at colleagues at home and abroad, the thorniness of handling affairs, coupled with the danger of the world's encirclement, Xiang enters the hall three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, to sincerely pray for the motherland, for colleagues, and for ancestors. I am especially worried that this is not enough. Therefore, I respectfully write to the Roman See, appealing for a special blessing on all my diplomatic colleagues to show love and encouragement. I offer my meager sincerity as a permanent commemoration and strive to complete the legacy of my late teacher Xu Wensu. In addition to sending a copy of the original letter to my former colleagues Gu, Wang, Wu, Chen (Youren), Shi, Wei (Note Dong), and Wang (Jiafu), I have sent a French copy to Envoy Fu. Please present it to you for your perusal, to earn a smile. Respectfully, I wish you peace. Your disciple Lu Zhengxiang, respectfully, 20th year, 12th month, 18th day."</p>

<p>A 103-Year-Old Long-Lived Person: There is a 103-year-old long-lived person in England, named Alfred Arnold. He has even forgotten that he is so old and has begun working in the film industry. Recently, a film company was producing a film in Elstree, and he enthusiastically participated, serving as an actor. He claims that he will work hard in the future and will definitely become a star. He was born in Bloomsbury in 1828. He is now a full 104 years old. However, looking at his appearance, he seems to be about 70 years old. No one can tell that he is over 100 years old. And his agility and vitality make it seem like he is not even 70 years old. He usually takes long walks or boats on the Serpentine, which keeps him light on his feet. He also said, "When I was in the East, I learned a kind of meditation from India. I still do it to this day, so it keeps me alive and young."</p>
<h3 id="e115">Recording Two Maps of the Brutal Sun's Invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Cailiang</p>
<p>Alas, since the Shenyang Incident, more than four months have passed. Alarming news has been heard frequently, and my heart is broken. Yesterday happened to be a holiday, so I invited several comrades to take a trip to the suburbs together to relieve my boredom. On the way back, we passed the Yousheng Travel Agency on Labor Hall Road in this city and went in together for a short rest. As soon as we sat down, we saw two brightly colored maps hanging on the walls of the agency. I was quite surprised and asked about them. Only then did I learn that they were important maps published by the brutal Sun several years ago after surveying various parts of our Northeast. One is called "Outline Map of Manchuria and Korea," and the other is called "New Map of Manchuria and Mongolia." Although their names are different, their content is the same. They are all aimed at invading the entire Manchuria and Mongolia, that is, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Eastern Mongolia. Regarding transportation, in addition to our country's inherent railways, they also focus on the recently completed Jihui Road and the north-south South Manchuria Railway as the main lines. For all important towns along the line that can connect to the hinterland, the distance and how to get there are analyzed in detail. What is especially noteworthy is that the names of all small markets are marked in Japanese. Their ambition for invasion is clearly visible. In addition, famous products of the Eastern Provinces, such as soybeans, wool, coal, iron, and wood, are drawn in detail in the locations of each production area. They are all lifelike and full of tempting colors. Furthermore, each port where Japanese consuls are stationed must have a sun flag drawn as a symbol. Now that I have seen this map today, I feel even more heartache. I still remember hearing Mr. Huang Ren's words when he returned from Japan last spring: when he was traveling in Fusang, he often saw a new map of Manchuria and Mongolia hanging on the desks of large and small agencies in that country. And on the billboards of various stations, the words "Go to Manchuria and Mongolia" were often seen. That country's plot against us is so urgent. What will we do? I know that sitting and talking is far less effective than getting up and acting quickly. After I finished looking at this map, I couldn't help but sigh. Then I thought that some of my compatriots may not fully know about it, so I picked up my pen to record it.</p>

<p>Wujin has a 　lake. The area west of the lake is rich in yellow finches. Their taste is delicious, surpassing even pigeon meat. They can be served with wine and can be used as a side dish. It is a famous local product of this village. They are often taken as gifts for relatives and friends. Therefore, residents of the lakeside catch them and sell them in the market for money, no less than a sideline for fishermen. This autumn, there are more fish and crabs, and yellow finches are also particularly abundant. Although the price is not high, the income of bird catchers is naturally abundant.</p>
<p>Yellow finches mostly live on reed beaches, like geese who like to live by the water and flock together. Bird catchers do not divine the day but the night. The most suitable nights are those with a faint moon and a light breeze. The vision of finches at night is dull, but their hearing is sharp. If a strong wind shakes the reeds, the finches will settle down and stop flying, making it difficult for people to start. If the night is still and there is no wind, then the quiet footsteps of people are easily detected. They avoid disaster and fly away. Only when the breeze sways and the reeds rustle, mixing with our quiet footsteps, will the finches not be aware. They seem like wooden 　.</p>

<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>A Self-Narration by Movie Star Hu Die</p>
<p>To put it more deeply, women in our country often suffer from social oppression and bullying; under widespread oppression and bullying, the weak succumb, while the strong continue to struggle. However, we must know that the methods of struggle may be different, but the strength of struggle is the same. Why does society value female dignitaries on the political stage too much, while undervaluing female actresses in the artistic realm?</p>
<p>I dare say that if this distorted social psychology does not change, then no art, no women's movement can have any hope of success.</p>
<p>The conversation is getting farther and farther away. The motive for writing this article is to faithfully expose the life of a professional woman who is noticed by many people. I am not doing a stereotypical eulogy for Ms. Hu Die, nor am I doing free publicity for Ms. Hu Die or the films she stars in. Here, I hope people will know some of the true artistic life of movie actresses, not as people usually guess.</p>
<p>| The following are all the words of Ms. Hu Die, which I have faithfully recorded. | Sufeng</p>
<p>Ms. Hu Die said</p>
<p>The transition from North Sichuan Road to Dumei Road seems to have a kind of "transition" Shanghai has never given me any interest; what gives me interest is only my family and my work. Therefore, what I call "transition" is a transformation from one aspect of freedom and leisure to many aspects of labor. However, I am not without a deep understanding of my life | indeed, not just my life | due to the increase in experience. I believe that my labor is helping my freedom and leisure; and I also believe that those who do not work may be people without freedom and leisure; therefore, my labor has also become a meaningful enjoyment. However, many people in society do not know this, and many people think that being a relatively high-status movie actress is surrounded by a state of intoxication. Ah! Let me tell a story first</p>
<p>People are allowed to catch them. The method is to weave a net into a cover. Cover it from behind. Capture them one by one. Do not startle the others when capturing. If one finch is startled, the flock will fly away. You will not get anything all night. Therefore, those whose experience is not refined and whose skills are not agile do not dare to try it. The loss of one person affects the benefits of others. It will incur public anger and be subject to condemnation and blame. Alas! Catching cicadas and juggling balls each has its own wonders. Even in the smallest of matters in the world, there must be cultivation over time, and there is no chance of good fortune overnight. How much more so in the matter of writing? It is truly as Taishi Gong (Sima Qian) said, "It is difficult to explain to those with shallow views and little knowledge without a love of learning and deep thought, and knowing the reason." Why do junior scholars who have never experienced hardship rashly take up a pen and want to be like Ya Guan Qu Yuan and Xi Wei Ji Shu scolding people? Their intelligence is no greater than that of a fisherman or a bird catcher.</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>Second Episode: Conversing and Laughing, He Receives Bad News from a Good Teacher; At Home, He Encounters Robbery and Pities His Beloved Friend in Isolation, A Spring-like Atmosphere Arises in the Room. But then I remembered my cousin, An Da Kui. He opened a Fu Ju Xiang silk and satin store in Tianjin. I heard that my father also had some shares in it. In the past, my tuition fees were often remitted from there. The day before yesterday, I wrote to this cousin, asking him to arrange a sum of money to be sent to me first. After the money arrives, I will decide what to do. I am very grateful for your concern. But I can only tell you these things for now. As for what happens in the future, I will talk to you in detail when the time comes. Since we are so close, I will not do anything behind your back. Liang Xiao Yun replied very affectionately. A gentleman bides his time for three years to take revenge. I always advise you not to be too impatient. It's better to study hard in Beijing and talk about it after you graduate. Since the family is already in such a mess, there is no use in you going back. There is even no need to risk that danger. It's not a difficult thing if you only need a few more dollars to spend. Even I, as your friend, can easily help you out. You don't have to write a letter to your uncle asking for it. An Yu Tian couldn't help but smile bitterly. How can I have the nerve to ask you to help me? But you are really too kind to me. I really don't know how to thank you. Liang Xiao Yun suddenly acted coquettishly. I don't come. Other people are sincere and earnest to you, but you always treat me like an outsider. Why are you embarrassed to ask me to help you? And why do you have to say such polite words to thank me? Do you really think I am not worthy of being your friend? An Yu Tian didn't expect that a word would anger this affectionate beauty, so he had to apologize and say, "Okay, okay. It's my fault for being muddled and not knowing how to speak. Please don't be angry. Don't blame me. Now that I am so lonely and isolated, I really need friends to help me. What's more, you are such a good friend. I can't ask for anything more. I'm just afraid that I'm not worthy. How dare I be so ungrateful and reject you?" Liang Xiao Yun smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"Okay, that's settled. I'm determined to be your friend. And I'm not afraid that you'll dislike me. Anyway, you won't be so embarrassed to say you dislike me to my face, right? Now is the time when you are sad. I won't argue with you anymore. Let me do my best to accompany you and coax you. Otherwise, you'll be bored to death. Look, the room is so cold and icy. You've been crying and weeping here alone for so many days. What are you doing? Why are you torturing yourself like this? There's no one else here today. I'm sure you haven't had a comfortable meal yet. I'll ask the waiter to order some dishes from the restaurant and I'll eat with you." An Yu Tian wanted to stop her, but Liang Xiao Yun was as light as a swallow and had already gone to ask the waiter to take care of it. After a while, the wine and dishes were delivered. They were all very exquisite and delicious foods. Liang Xiao Yun dragged An Yu Tian to his seat and sat beside him. First, she raised the pot in her red sleeve and diligently offered wine. Then she used a spoon to serve food and urged him to eat more. An Yu Tian couldn't refuse and had to eat some. Liang Xiao Yun also talked and laughed cheerfully, picking out some interesting and witty jokes to tell. She never mentioned An Yu Tian's unfortunate family affairs again, trying to dispel An Yu Tian's worries and immerse him in the gentle land of this beautiful scenery. Sure enough, the humble room became spring-like, and a trace of a smile gradually appeared on An Yu Tian's furrowed brow. Seeing that they were full of wine and food, the waiter suddenly came in to report, "Mr. An, there's a phone call. It's from the Normal University. It's someone named Li. Please answer it quickly." An Yu Tian couldn't help but be shocked. He pushed his cup away and got up, hurrying away. If you want to know what happened, please wait for the next episode.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Financial and Gold Markets Continue to Soften <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Another Fall of Five Taels and Eight Mace</p>
<p>The U.S. Bank Was Requested by France to Withdraw a Large Amount of Deposits. Yesterday, the Gold Market Situation Changed from Stable and Firm to Weak and Declining. There Were Some Fluctuations in Between. The Difference Between the Opening and Closing Prices Was More Than Eleven Taels. In the End, It Fell by About Six Taels. The Selling Intention of Each Company Was Stronger. Although the Large Bars Were Raised at the Opening, the U.S. Bank Did Not Change, So There Was No Impact. Then It Continued to Rise. But Then the Foreign Exchange Suddenly Tightened and Then Loosened. Soon After, Foreign News Spread That the U.S. Bank Had Been Requested by France to Withdraw a Large Amount of Deposits. As a Result, People Became Timid and the Selling Trend Increased. It Plunged Sharply, Breaking Through 690 Taels. The Afternoon Market Was Even More Difficult, and the Securities Market Had Already Opened, But the Price Plunged. The Aftermarket Was Very Peaceful, and Most of the Companies Were Helpless. The Price Also Only Fluctuated by One or Two Taels. This Was Really Because There Was a Lack of Foreign Exchange Market on Wednesday. As for the Swap, the Long and Short Positions Were Even.</p>

Then, Because Zhi Feng, Yong Yuan Kang Xiang, Da De Cheng, and Others Came to Buy, the Price Rose by More Than Four Taels. It Was Probably Because the Exchange Companies Were Involved. It Was Estimated That the April British Gold Was Half a Penny to 4375, and the U.S. Gold Was Half a Dollar, Up to 94 Taels and Nine Mace at 9:20.

Next Month's British Gold Was Settled at 5625, Followed by 625 to Settle the U.S. Gold at 32.75 Yuan. The Banks' Asking Price Was 875, Especially When Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan, Da Yong Qian, Chang Xiang Yu He, Xie Kang Heng Xing, and Others Dumped, the Price Fell by More Than Five Taels.

Later, Because Heng and Yuan Mao Yong and Others Came to Advance, It Immediately Increased by Two Taels to 85.5 Taels. After That, There Were Slight Ups and Downs Between 84 and 5 Taels. But the Transactions Were Dull and There Was No Sign of Life. At 3 O'Clock, Retail Sales Seemed to Be Slightly Inferior. At 4:15, It Was 84 Taels and One Mace.

<p>The Overall Situation of the Market Was That the Silver and Money Industries Mostly Ended Their Business, and the Situation in Business Was Plain. The Low and High of the Discount and Surcharge Prices Were Estimated Based on the Complexity of the Transactions, and There Was No Major Event Worth Recording. However, Because the Closing Account Period Was Near, the Collection and Settlement Situation Was Naturally More Trivial Than Usual.

<p>The Price Was Initially Firm and Stable, Then Fell Sharply and Recovered.</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange Resumed Four Sessions of Trading Throughout the Day.</p>
<p>The Securities Market in This Port, Which Had Been Suspended for More Than a Week, Had a Better Trend in Recent Days. The Situation of Each Party Had Slightly Turned Around. It Resumed Trading Yesterday, and the Securities Exchange Also Announced the Resumption of Four Sessions of Trading Throughout the Day to Adapt to the Market. The Inflow and Outflow Throughout the Day Were Very Lively. The Morning Market Initially Had Good Market Sentiment. It Was Said That the News from Each Party Was Still Good. The Government Expressed That It Would Maintain Creditworthiness, and the Previous Rumor That Provinces and Regions Were Intercepting Tax Funds Was Not True. Therefore, the Retail Inflow Was Relatively Strong. However, With the Selling Transactions Becoming Smoother, the Large Accounts Were Said to Have Sold a Large Amount. As a Result, the Selling Vigor Was Active, and the Market Prices Fell One After Another to Supply the Excessive Demand. In the Two Sessions Before and After the Noon Market, the Decline Was Very Sharp. For a Time, the Market Sentiment Turned Virtual, and the Market Was Tense. After the Closing, the Market Still Did Not Improve. The Customs Duty Compilation Was Very Tired. The Military Reduction for One Month Was Stopped Because the Price Had Fallen to the Limit. Afterwards, the Market Sentiment Slightly Turned Around. The Large Accounts Had Not Been Seen to Continue Selling, and the Retail Customers in the Market Were Reversely Active in Buying Low. The Prices Recovered and Firmed Up One After Another, Each Rising by About One Yuan. As a Result, Compared with the Market Prices on Tuesday of the Previous Week, Except for the Salt Tax in February, Which Rose by Seven Mace and a Half, and the Nian Juan in February, Which Rose by One Mace, the Others Continued to Fall.

<p>The Yarn Market Was Slightly Tired, but the Situation Was Still Stable. Because the Actual Sales Were Still Developing, the Procurement in Yunnan and Guangdong Was Still Strong, and the Actions of the Sichuan Gang Were Slightly Fixed. The Number of Transactions Checked This Month Was Still Large, and the Delivery Was About 3,000 Bales, and the Receipt Was About 4,000 to 5,000 Bales. Therefore, Some People's Minds Were Bullish. Judging From the General Trend, the Market Should Be Flat. The National Affairs Were Not, and the Japanese Invasion Was Still Fierce. The British Factory Opened 4,000 Bales, and the Japanese Merchants Changed Their Brands and the Events Were Seen to Be Discovered. Two People Bid Well for the Distant Month's Seconds Before the Market Opened, and the Situation Was Flat. Because U.S. Cotton Was Weak, There Were Not Many Buyers in the Market, and Each Month Fell by Three or Four Cash. The Afternoon Market Became More Tired, and Each Month Fell by Two, Four, Five, and Six Cash. The Total Transaction Statistics for the Day Were 19,100 Bales. It Was Found That Rong Xing Sold 1,150 Bales, Yuan Tai 850 Bales, Gong Tai 550 Bales, and Yu Da 450 Bales. Tian Long Bought 650 Bales, Hou Feng 700 Bales, Da Ji 650 Bales, and He Shen 350 Bales.

<p>The Cotton Market Was Slightly Tired, and the Trend Was Still Flat. Only U.S. Cotton Was Flat and Tired, and Indian Cotton Was Still Stopped. The Gold Price Was Slightly Soft, So People Were Calm and Stable. It Was Said in the Business Community That Indian Cotton Had Fallen by More Than Ten Rupees. As a Result, the Situation Became Weak and the Selling Was More Intense. However, the Prices in Each Road's Territory Were Still Difficult to Loosen, So the Source Was Not Smooth. However, Judging From the General Trend, There Was No Big Decline at Present.</p>
<p>The Han Standard Fell Slightly by Two or Three Cash. The Han Standard Opened in the Previous Market, and U.S. Cotton Fell Slightly.

<p>Last week, the price of dried lily flowers rose slightly (by one or two taels for high-grade goods) due to strong demand from buyers from Guangdong province. However, observing recent market trends, it seems that the appetites of these buyers have been satisfied. Consequently, the previously firm market has softened. Furthermore, dealers from Fujian province also seem eager to sell, indicating a possible decline in prices in the future, especially for lower-grade goods, such as those with a darker color. It is unlikely that these goods will see favorable prices again before the year-end settlement.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port became increasingly sluggish. According to reports, silk sales in the New York market continued to be weak. The telegraph price for Shanghai raw white silk, grade B, was only $1.70 USD per pound, equivalent to only 720 taels of Chinese silver per 100 catties. Factories must lose over 400 taels per bale, making it increasingly difficult to sell.

<p>Due to the closure of various businesses, the metal market has been showing a sluggish trend in recent days. Although white lead sheets had a brief period of growth, the current trend is also very cold. Moreover, those holding existing goods are eager to sell them off quickly, so the future of the standard goods is increasingly bleak.

<p>Two Arson Attacks on the Sanyou Industrial Society in the Morning</p>
<p>A Chinese Constable of the Municipal Council Killed, Two Injured</p>
<p>In the Afternoon, After the Residents' Association Meeting, They Provoked Trouble Along the Way</p>
<p>Attacked Shops and Streetcars, Also Injured Two Western Constables</p>
<p>The Sanyou Industrial Society factory in Yinxiang Port in this city was suddenly attacked around 2:30 AM yesterday by forty to fifty Japanese thugs carrying firearms, bayonets, kerosene, sulfur, and other flammable materials. They set fire to the factory. The Chinese constable at the warning station at the end of Ward Road in the Public Concession heard the alarm and notified the police station by telephone, which dispatched police to provide assistance. Unexpectedly, the Japanese thugs used sharp blades to stab fiercely and opened fire. As a result, one Chinese constable was killed and two were injured. One Japanese thug also died from a gunshot wound. At Sanyou Society, a portion of the weaving department was burned, and many weaving machines were damaged. Around 1:00 PM, Japanese residents held the Shanghai Japanese Residents' General Meeting at the Japanese Club on Peng Road. The meeting resolved to request the Japanese government to send troops to Shanghai to curb the anti-Japanese movement. After the meeting, they marched in teams and rioted on North Sichuan Road, destroying shops opened by Chinese along the road and damaging streetcars and buses. Western constables were also injured. The municipal government has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Consulate regarding the arson attack on the Sanyou factory by the Japanese thugs. The Municipal Public Security Bureau and the concession police station have also dispatched more police and constables to North Sichuan Road to strictly guard against further incidents. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e136">Japanese Attempted to Destroy the Sanyou Industrial Society <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Factory Site Overview: The Sanyou Industrial Society factory is located in Yinxiangxiang at the end of Ward Road in the Public Concession, which belongs to the Chinese area. However, the front gate faces south and borders the concession. The arson attack by the Japanese thugs yesterday morning occurred in the weaving department in the northwest corner, also known as the small machine room. The outside is surrounded by bamboo fences. The thugs entered by making holes in the bamboo fence. The west side is connected to Huama Road, leading to the front gate of the factory. The north side is an open space, and the northeast side is where the employees live. The Japanese thugs launched two attacks yesterday morning. The first attack was around 2:30 AM, and the second attack was about half an hour later. The situation calmed down around 5:00 AM.</p>
<p>Two Routes of Attack: It is said the Japanese had visited the factory area a few days earlier and surveyed the terrain. The arson attack yesterday morning appears to have been carried out from two directions. One group traveled east along Ward Road, and the other group traveled along a remote path behind the Donghua Cotton Mill. The group that came from Ward Road clashed with the Chinese constables at the No. 1 police pavilion at the end of Ward Road, resulting in three Chinese constables being killed or injured. Realizing they had caused a major incident, they immediately retreated. Therefore, the front of the Sanyou factory was not damaged. The damage was caused by the group that took the remote path behind the Donghua factory. The arson was carried out at 2:50 AM. All the fuel used was highly explosive materials such as alcohol, kerosene, and gasoline, which were placed in five or six-pound Japanese-made beer bottles. Sulfur explosives were used as ignition.</p>

<p>Sudden Fire: According to an investigation by reporters after the incident, a factory employee said that around 2:40 AM, all the employees in the factory were asleep when they suddenly heard a strange noise in the northwest corner. Then they saw flames rising from the weaving department. The factory was equipped with fire extinguishers, so they rushed out to put out the fire while also notifying the Yangshupu Fire Brigade. By the time the fire trucks arrived, the fire had already spread. The people in the factory were initially unaware of the cause of the sudden fire.</p>
<p>The Police Killed: The Japanese retreated along the original routes. Some who came from Ward Road arrived at police station No. 1, where Chinese constables Chen Shengde, No. 3029, and Tian Runsheng, No. 765, were on guard. Suddenly, they saw a group of people turning the corner in the dark, and another fire broke out at the Sanyou factory. They were about to use the telephone to report to the Yangshupu police station when the Japanese, fearing that the news would leak out, immediately cut the telephone line. Chinese constable Chen had two fingers on his left hand cut off and fell to the ground in pain. The glass windows of the police box and the electrical communication lines were destroyed. Constable Tian rushed out, intending to escape to the police station to report, but the Japanese followed closely. Being outnumbered, he was surrounded by the Japanese at the intersection of Linqing Road and Hejian Road, west of the Linqing Bridge. Unable to escape and fearing for his life due to the Japanese carrying weapons, the constable fired into the air as a warning. However, the gunshots only made the Japanese press closer. The constable had no choice but to fire a volley at the thugs and emptied the second magazine. He tried to reload, but he was too late. He was stabbed to death by the Japanese. As for Chinese constables No. 1116 and No. 3152, they had just left the police station to go on duty and heard that a fire had broken out in Yinxiang Port. They slowly walked towards the end of Ward Road. Seeing a group of Japanese and broken glass windows at the police station, constable No. 1116 attempted to investigate but was also stabbed and fell to the side of the gate of the Samsung Cotton and Iron Manufacturing Factory. The other constable, No. 3152, realized that the situation was irreparable and could lead to a major disaster, so he retreated, with only a minor injury to his arm. He returned to bandage himself. The Japanese snatched the gun bag, belt, and hat of constable No. 3029 and threw them into a small creek on the side of the road.</p>

<p>Throwing Fire Sources: The Japanese used oil-soaked newspapers, sulfur, and alcohol as the source of fire. These are all flammable materials. At that time, they were thrown from below, so the roof of the weaving department was burned the most severely. In addition, the walls and other places were also burned. Afterwards, employees of the factory searched inside the fence and found many discarded kerosene bottles and sulfur packages. Some of them were collected and taken away by the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District in the Fifth Zone and the police.</p>
<p>Also Shot and Wounded: Because the telephone line in the police box had been cut, there was no way to immediately transmit the news. The Japanese were able to calmly carry out the arson work. Later, the police station and the Fourth Office of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau dispatched a large number of police and constables, but the thugs had already escaped into the darkness without a trace. It is said they hid in the Donghua Cotton Mill. The Chinese constable No. 765 who died from stab wounds inflicted by the Japanese thugs was named Tian Runsheng, aged two</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Destroyed Weaving Room (photograph by Huishanshi) <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Re-attack: About an hour after the fire in the weaving department was extinguished, the thugs returned, seemingly intending to burn down the factory's boiler room. The boiler room is located in the east of the factory, halfway between the northern furnace rooms. The west side of the furnace rooms are the workers' dormitories, separated by an alley. To the west of the dormitory, across an open field several dozen steps away, is the Donghua Cotton Mill, making it easy for the Japanese to come and go. The Japanese turned into the alley during their second attack and threw sulfur packets and explosive packets, seemingly intending to burn down the furnace room. However, the southern section was all brick walls. The outer bamboo fence hid the building inside. The fence and walls were about a dozen feet apart, so the explosives thrown by the Japanese all landed inside the fence in the courtyard, making it difficult to hit the target. Moreover, the Japanese knew that the factory was prepared, so they did not dare to stay for long and retreated soon after.</p>
<p>Police Converge: During the struggle between the Japanese thugs and the Chinese police, one thug was shot and killed by the police. Two were ten years old and from Shandong. The injured were Chinese police Chen Shengde, No. 3029, who was seriously injured, and Zhu Wulan, No. 1116, who was lightly injured. Both are being treated at the Municipal Council Hospital. On the Japanese side, the deceased was Ryoze Matsujuro, 32 years old. The injured were Kitatsuji Takuji and Mori Masanobu.</p>
<p>Court Investigation: Eleven Japanese in total infiltrated the police station and used violence to monitor the actions of the police officers within. They then cut the phone lines, vandalized all the glass windows, and joined the Japanese who were standing outside of the station, before leaving. On Linqing Road, they randomly stabbed the face and back of constable 765 Tian Runsheng, who could not bear it any longer and passed away. Yesterday morning, the deceased was carried to the forensic examination room on Feilun Road. Around 9 AM, the police reported to the First Special District Court, who assigned prosecutor Guo Huai and forensic doctors to the scene. After inspecting Tian Runsheng's body, it was determined that he had been stabbed in the face and back and died. The Western police chief briefly explained the situation that caused the incident, as more detailed facts were still being investigated, he requested a week's extension to allow time to continue with the investigation, after which he would report the details. Prosecutor Guo granted the request and rescheduled the hearing to next Wednesday. As the deceased Tian Runsheng had no family in Shanghai, the Municipal Council was instructed to provide a coffin and temporarily place the body for collection.</p>
<p>Police Orders: Yesterday, after the incident occurred, the Chinese constables in the Concession were extremely angry. Chief of the Concession Police, Qiu Lai, issued an urgent order, which stated that it had been discovered that a group of Japanese vagrants had attacked Chinese Constable No. 3029 in the Yinxiang Port police box this morning, and had set fire to a factory. Chinese Constable No. 765, Tian Runsheng, was killed by vagrants while he was rushing to the rescue. Qiu expressed his deepest condolences and guaranteed he would spare no effort to punish the criminals, and also assured the entire staff that the police would be particularly protected if there were any acts of retaliation against the police officers. He hoped that all the officers would remain calm and continue to serve as usual, and that the staff would maintain its inherent high standards of discipline and self-respect. In order to protect the Sanyou Industrial Society, after the headquarters was repeatedly attacked and set on fire by the Japanese yesterday morning, a special envoy went to the Municipal Government to petition, requesting the City Government to inform the Municipal Public Security Bureau and send police to the factory for protection. After receiving the news, the Public Security Bureau immediately ordered a team of more than 30 police officers to go to the factory in Yinxiang Port at around 3 PM to be stationed and maintain order.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Loss: The exact amount of loss to the Sanyou Factory is still unknown, but it has been estimated by factory staff that, including the destroyed roof and walls, along with the damage to more than 20 weaving machines, the loss is worth around 4,000 to 5,000 taels of silver. A total of seven factory buildings were damaged. Because sulfur was used to start the fire, there are many large and small burned holes in the roof, making it difficult to repair.</p>
<p>Factory Affairs Meeting: The Sanyou Factory, after being set on fire twice by the Japanese, convened a factory affairs meeting overnight to discuss (1) the Japanese disturbance along the way, and (2) the maintenance methods for the Municipal Council's suppression of the police vehicles and Japanese Marines.</p>

<p>Shen Jiu Cheng, the general manager of the factory, also went to the factory at 8 AM to inspect the damage. Wu Yuting, the chief of the Fourth Branch of the Fifth District, sent three police officers to the scene. By then, the fire had been extinguished. Wu also personally went to the scene in the morning to investigate. The purpose of the factory meeting was to prevent future incidents. As a result, in addition to the original fire brigade, rescue, patrol, and disciplinary teams will be formed. All the team members will be workers. Because the workers are in a dangerous situation, they will also unite with the labor union, the factory, and the guild district branch to discuss the aftermath today.</p>
<p>Lao's Remarks: Lao Huimin, the acting factory director, told a reporter from the Guowen News Agency that the Japanese arrived outside the factory at 2:50 AM and then carried out the arson. They first poured alcohol and set fire to the weaving room. Since it was late at night, no one in the factory knew about it. Later, the person on duty in the west of the yard came to report, and the factory's own fire brigade tried their best to put out the fire, preventing a major disaster. Not only was there a loss of funds, but also the towels and fabrics that had not yet been woven on the machines were all soaked in water and difficult to sell. The evidence left by the Japanese was taken away by the police and the Public Security Bureau for filing. This person only picked up many sulfur-wrapped cloths, which were confirmed to be Japanese fabrics upon inspection. They returned at 4:00 AM for a second time. Some say there were twenty or so people, others say there were forty or fifty. Because the factory's firefighting was not timely, it was impossible to confirm. General Manager Shen Jiu Cheng had just come over and has now returned. He probably instructed the factory's legal advisor, Tan Yigong, to prepare a document to submit to the government authorities and send police to maintain order. In short, the factory's view is that we do not hope for a victory in negotiations, because if negotiations can be won, our Chinese Eastern Province would not have been humiliated to this point. This is also something that everyone knows well. However, since this unfortunate event has occurred, we only hope that everything will not escalate from small things into big things and that the same incident will not happen again. He also said that this morning (yesterday) he heard rumors that (1) the area opposite the Fifth District was originally the headquarters of the Japanese residents, and because something happened, a Japanese machine gun team conducted drills there at 6 AM, whether for training or for demonstration, it is difficult to guess, and it is hoped that the responsible authorities will take precautions.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Japanese Acts of Violence on North Sichuan Road <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Residents Association After the arson attack by the Japanese thugs in Yinxiang Port, more than 1,000 Japanese held the Shanghai Japanese Residents' General Meeting at 1 PM yesterday on the second floor of the Japanese Club on Peng Road in the Public Concession. Lin, the chairman of the various road joint committees, was elected as the chairman. Yasui reported and Otsuki Shigeru gave a speech. A decision was made on the spot to telegraph their government to send more land and naval forces to suppress the anti-Japanese movement.</p>
<p>Marching and Demonstrating: The meeting adjourned at around 3 PM. The Japanese people were divided into two groups and went to the Japanese Consulate and the headquarters of the Marines to petition, holding wooden poles and making a fierce noise. Those going north walked along Bazhi Road. All the concession police and Japanese soldiers followed to monitor. At the intersection of Bazhi Road and North Sichuan Road, they turned north, shouting slogans.</p>
<p>Provoking Trouble Along the Way: When the marching team arrived at Qiujiang Road, the Japanese in the rear team had already passed Qiujiang Road and were proceeding towards North Sichuan Road. Seeing anti-Japanese slogans posted in Chinese shops, thirty or forty Japanese went to the shops on the west side of the road and used their bamboo poles and wooden bars to smash the doors and windows of the shops. More than a dozen shops had their large glass windows smashed. For a time, passersby stopped to watch, and the noise was deafening. Electric car No. 125 and bus No. 15070 going from north to south also had their windows smashed by the Japanese. The driver and passengers were injured. The names of the shops whose glass and goods were damaged are as follows: No. 663, Dade Electrical Material Factory, opposite Dade Alley on North Sichuan Road; No. 657, Dekang Pawnshop; No. 625, Yichang Electrical Material Store. The above are under the jurisdiction of the First Office of the Fifth District. On the opposite side, Tongfutai Hat and Shoe Store, Mingxing Foreign Goods Store, Tang Bailin Wine Shop, Qiaoxiang Restaurant, and Tongli Foreign Wine Shop belong to the Public Security Bureau of the Second Office of the Fifth District. In addition, No. 124, Sanyou Store, and No. 868, Hengfengchang Cloth Store, are both on Yingui Road and under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District. The losses suffered by each shop range from 100 to 500 or 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Assaulting Western Police: When the Japanese marched around and attacked streetcars and buses, the Western police officer Xue Bei from the Hongkou police station stepped forward to stop them but was beaten on the head by the Japanese with large sticks. Also, Western police officer No. 370 from the Diswei Road police station was beaten while the Japanese were committing violence. A Chinese named Xin Xiaojing was beaten in front of the Yunfei Motor Company on Qiujiang Road, but the injuries were minor. All of the injured were taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Stepped-Up Security: After the Japanese caused trouble and committed violence, they continued forward to petition at their Marine Corps headquarters. The Public Security Bureau and police station have dispatched more police and armed military police to patrol the streets and step up security. However, the shops along the area from Bazhi Road to Qiujiang Road were temporarily closed to prevent the Japanese from intruding and causing trouble.</p>

<p>Wang arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will enter the capital today.</p>
<p>Chiang is scheduled to fly from Hangzhou to Beijing this morning.</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke went from Beijing to Hangzhou to meet with Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek to urge them to go to Beijing. Both had agreed, and Sun was scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hangzhou at 2 PM yesterday. Wang Jingwei, He Yingqin, Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, Song Ziwen, and other important figures left Hangzhou one after another yesterday to come to Shanghai. Sun Ke and others took the night train to Beijing that evening. Wang Jingwei originally intended to travel together, but due to the fatigue of the journey and his lack of physical strength, he rested in Shanghai for one night and changed his plans to travel to Beijing by train this afternoon or tonight. Chiang Kai-shek is scheduled to fly directly to Nanjing from Hangzhou this morning at 10 AM in his private plane. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sun and Wang Arrive in Shanghai: After the Railways learned of the news that the dignitaries were going to Beijing, Zheng Baozhao, the director of the Vehicle Department, personally went to the Hangzhou station to coordinate the vehicles. President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke left Hangzhou first at 9:55 AM yesterday, taking a special car prepared by the Railways, attached to the early express train to Shanghai, arriving at the port at 2:10 PM, and immediately returned to his residence to rest. Accompanying him were Secretary Chen Jianru and National Government Committee member Ma Fuxiang. Wang Jingwei left Hangzhou at 1:58 PM, taking a special car attached to the medium-speed train to Shanghai, accompanied by Mrs. Wang Jingwei, Chen Bijun, and Chu Minyi. Wang and his wife got off at Fanwangdu Station and went directly to their private residence to rest. As for Zhang Jingjiang, He Yingqin, Kong Xiangxi and his wife, Zhang Ji, Song Ziwen, Tang Hai'an, Zeng Zhongming, Wang Boqun, and others, they traveled together in three special cars attached to the night express train from Hangzhou to Shanghai. Song Ziwen and Tang Hai'an got off at Fanwangdu Station, while Zhang Jingjiang and Kong Xiangxi and his wife got off at the North Station and each returned to their private residence by car.</p>
<p>Night Train to Beijing Last Night: At 11:45 PM last night, Sun Ke, He Yingqin, Zhang Ji, Li Zongren, Zeng Zhongming, Wang Boqun, Chen Jianru, and others took the night train to Beijing. The Railways specially sent section chief Tang Huannan to take care of them on the train. Wang Jingwei was originally scheduled to travel together, but he temporarily decided to rest in Shanghai for one night due to fatigue, and he will take the 3:15 PM express train or the night express train to Beijing today.</p>
<p>Chiang and Wang Meet in Beijing: When Wang Jingwei left Hangzhou yesterday, Chiang Kai-shek told Wang that no matter what, the two of us will meet in Beijing on the 22nd at the latest. Chiang had originally planned to come to Shanghai with Wang yesterday, but this plan was cancelled because Mrs. Song Meiling felt slightly unwell. Instead, he is scheduled to fly directly to the capital from Hangzhou at 10 AM this morning, and is expected to arrive in Beijing around 2 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Severing Diplomatic Relations with Japan: Xinsheng News Agency reported that President Sun had a two-day meeting with Wang and Chiang in Hangzhou. In addition to financial reform and other matters, the most discussed topic was foreign affairs, and among the foreign affairs issues, the most important was Foreign Minister Chen Youren's proposal to sever diplomatic relations with Japan. According to those who came with Sun and Wang, Wang expressed his support in principle, but he argued that the method of severing diplomatic relations and the second step of the procedure should be carefully considered. Although Chiang did not express his approval or opposition, he argued that the benefits and harms that our country would gain from declaring a break in diplomatic relations must be carefully studied. Sun believed that regardless of whether the diplomatic policy towards Japan was to sever diplomatic relations or adopt other measures, the three, Wang, Chiang, and Hu, had to go to Beijing to take joint responsibility.</p>
<p>Sun Ke's Speech: After arriving in Shanghai at 2 PM yesterday, Sun Ke gave a speech as follows: This time, I accepted the invitation of Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang to come to Hangzhou. The result of the two-day meeting was very satisfactory. Mr. Wang had been ill in Shanghai and was unable to enter Beijing for a time. Since leaving Beijing, Mr. Chiang was also unwilling to return to Beijing before Mr. Hu arrived in Beijing due to the temporary circumstances, which caused misunderstandings. When I met with them in Hangzhou, both gentlemen said that it was not enough to complete the situation of internal unity and unity in the party without inviting Mr. Hu to come north and enter Beijing together. However, Mr. Hu replied to the telegrams of Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang, maintaining his position as an unofficial capacity to support the government so that it could realize the responsibility of the cabinet in office and not need to enter the capital together, fearing it would involve restraint of the administration. I am extremely grateful for Mr. Hu's maturity in planning for the country and his far-sighted considerations. However, today's difficult situation is indeed not something that a few authorities in Beijing can be responsible for solving. The three gentlemen must jointly shoulder the responsibility of guidance, and the comrades in the party and the entire nation must work together sincerely and wholeheartedly to achieve something. Therefore, at the meeting in Hangzhou, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, Zhang Puquan, Ju Juesheng, and other gentlemen all shared this view and strongly urged Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang to enter Beijing first and then urge Mr. Hu to come north. At the gathering in Chenglou last night, Mr. Chiang and Mr. Wang had already agreed to my request. Mr. Wang will leave Hangzhou for Shanghai by special train this afternoon and will arrive in Beijing tomorrow morning. Mr. Chiang is also scheduled to fly to Beijing from Hangzhou tomorrow, so from now on the central government will be strengthened, and the difficult situation can be expected to improve. As for Mr. Hu's reply to Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang, there is a saying that he will support the government in an unofficial capacity and implement a responsible cabinet. I believe that, in a broad sense, the current government was produced by the Central Executive Committee and the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee and is not a government established by one or two people on its own. The entire Kuomintang can be said to be in power, and there is no mention of the Central Committee members being out of power. In a narrow sense, Mr. Wang, Mr. Chiang, and Mr. Hu are all members of the Central Committee, and they can participate in the central government affairs as members of the Central Committee, and there is no distinction as to who is out of power and who is in power. I firmly believe that the three gentlemen will come to Beijing and take joint responsibility, only guiding the government, deciding on major policies, and enabling the government authorities to take the lead and then be able to take responsibility for doing things. There is no restraint on the government, so that they cannot take responsibility. If the three gentlemen, as standing committee members, who bear the heavy responsibility of the party and the country, lead the way and do not move forward, resulting in the central government being empty, causing various major policies of internal affairs and foreign affairs to be delayed and unresolved, then the government colleagues, even if they want to take responsibility, will have no way to do so, which would be very harmful. I have expressed this intention to Mr. Hu in a telegram. Mr. Hu is wise and I think he would also think so.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Yesterday's General Meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Form the Shanghai Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Established an Executive Committee of Thirty-Five Members, Organized by Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a temporary general meeting of member representatives at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the thorough implementation of economic severance with Japan. It was resolved to form the Shanghai Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and to approve a 35-member executive committee, organized by industry, responsible for discussing methods to clear existing inventory. The details are recorded below. Representatives attending included those from 96 trade associations representing the money exchange, silk and satin, bookstore, coal, cotton cloth, clothing, porcelain, medicinal materials, soybean and rice, sugar, wool, cigarette, egg, rice shop, tobacco, sauce garden, north-south goods exchange, southern goods, timber, copper and tin, tobacco exchange, cotton weaving, paper, iron, electrical machinery and silk factory, department store, silk factory, watch, travel, soybean and rice trade, inland river shipping, and other industries, totaling over 250 people.</p>
<p>The meeting officials included the presidium members Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Ji, and Ye Huijun; Secretary Yan Esheng; Director-General Zheng Chengqing; Recorders Xue Guangqian and Wu Jichun; Master of Ceremonies Hu Weijian; and Secretaries Sun Wuqi, Xu Qing, Peng Zaizhi, Zhou Xiuquan, Jin Shengbai, Zhang Yukun, and Li Ruzhang.</p>
<p>After the chairman's report and customary salutations, Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported, stating that the purpose of convening this temporary meeting of member representatives was to discuss the request from seventeen trade associations to reorganize the Committee for Economic Severance with Japan into the Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Additionally, the Dongzhuang trade association requested the convening of a business and people's assembly to provide relief to the market. Because the Committee for Economic Severance with Japan was established in July of the previous year by a resolution of the temporary meeting of member representatives, the current request for reorganization from the seventeen trade associations, after 23 executive committee meetings, should still be submitted to the meeting of member representatives for discussion. Regarding how to dispose of sealed Japanese goods, how to release wrongly impounded goods, and how to actively boycott goods in the future, it is proposed to wait until after the reorganization is decided before the Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association convenes relevant industries for detailed discussion and implementation, in order to achieve both national salvation and protection of businesses. In short, all sectors of this city have a unified goal for the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. However, due to the different nature of their professions, their efforts are directed differently. The business community is skilled in distinguishing between goods and is responsible for the economic severance with Japan, which will surely be twice the result with half the effort, he concluded.</p>
<p>Representative's Address Next, He Yuanming, the representative from the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, delivered an address, stating that he felt very honored to attend this temporary meeting of member representatives on behalf of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department. The meaning and purpose of today's meeting have been reported by the chairman, which is to discuss issues such as economic severance with Japan. He hoped that today, under the careful discussion of leaders from various industries, a satisfactory solution could be reached. Speaking of Japan's invasion of the Northeast, all nationals are indignant. However, the methods to wash away shame and save the nation vary, and there are many paths to anti-Japanese national salvation. He then briefly outlined one or two points: 1) Prepare for resistance with real strength. According to historical experience, the Americas were able to break away from Britain and achieve independent, free, and equal status, and Spain was able to resist Napoleon's army that dominated Europe, because they had the strength to resist, and only then did they achieve final victory. Today, when we talk about anti-Japanese national salvation, everyone must first have the spirit of sacrifice in order to strengthen their strength and achieve the goal of wiping out shame and saving the country. 2) Strive to increase production, and boycott activities are the only effective weapon for small and weak nations to resist powerful nations. However, our country's boycott of Japanese goods has already occurred eight times in the past, but the failure of the results is known to everyone. The reasons are varied, but the neglect of efforts to increase production outside the boycott movement is the biggest obstacle to the anti-Japanese future. Today, when we talk about anti-Japanese national salvation, we should both strictly implement the boycott of Japanese goods and strive to increase production, so that we can counter goods with goods and implement the main purpose of economic severance with Japan. The above two points are contributed to you for reference, he concluded.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals 1) The proposal to reorganize the Committee for Economic Severance with Japan of seventeen trade associations, including the Brick and Ash Industry, Seafood and Grocery Industry, Seafood Shop Industry, Sugar Industry, Local Products Industry, Electrical Appliance Industry, Southern Goods Industry, Ramie Bag Cloth Industry, Yarn Industry, Fly Ash Industry, North-South Goods Exchange Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, New Medicine Industry, Color Printing Industry, Sausage Industry, and Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, into the Shanghai Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association; 2) The proposal from Dongzhuang trade association to convene a business and people's assembly to provide relief to the market. The above two proposals were combined and resolved with the following methods: A. The Committee for Economic Severance with Japan is abolished, and it will be expanded into the Shanghai Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association effective immediately. B. The Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association will establish an executive committee of 35 members, organized by industry. The approved list of executive committee members is as follows: 1. Chen Zixiang, North-South Goods Exchange Industry; 2. Wen Lanting, Yarn Industry; 3. Qiu Zijia, Transport and Sales of Lime Shop Industry; 4. Qian Jing, Pei Yunqing; 5. Ye Huijun, Chinese Grocery and Pastry Industry; 6. Cai Runshan, Fruit and Local Products Industry; 7.

Zhu Xiusheng, Seafood Shop Industry; 34. You Senting, Transfer and Lotus Root Export Business; 35. Wang Rongchang, Electrical Appliance Industry. D. Japanese goods stored in various industries should be cleared within a limited time. The methods will be discussed in detail by the committee. E. The committee's expenses will be raised by the municipal council. F. The purpose of initiating the organization of the Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association will be announced to all sectors. 3) The coal industry representatives proposed to request assistance from the industry association in reporting Yongchang Coal Company's private transportation of Japanese coal and collusion with the British firm Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Purpose of Establishment The Shanghai Business Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association announced its purpose of establishment, stating that since the incident last year in which Koreans brutally killed Chinese people, various sectors of this city have had organizations for anti-Japanese assistance to Korea. Later, as the violent Japan occupied the Northeast and spread its tyranny, it was reorganized by public consensus into the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, hoping to expand the scope and strengthen the organization. Judging from the situation in the past few months, although the effect of perfection has not been achieved due to environmental constraints, the enemy has been deeply wary and regarded it as a major enemy of aggression. Their ridicule and curses are exhausting, which is enough to prove the enormity of the injuries they have suffered. At the same time, our business community, by the resolution of the temporary meeting of member representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, automatically implemented economic severance with Japan and organized the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Committee for Economic Severance with Japan, hoping to achieve the effect of cooperative action under the unified anti-Japanese steps. Judging from the past experience of the past few months, what is revealed to us is that there are two shortcomings: one is the lack of concentration of talent. The influential figures in the business community have not been fully recruited, so the work efficiency has not been fully improved. The other is the failure to determine the powers and responsibilities and the failure of the name to be inclusive. Anti-Japanese national salvation is a common responsibility of all sectors. The situation is serious and changing rapidly. Since there is an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of all sectors to take overall charge, various professional groups should also have individual organizations within the scope of their own industries to achieve the purpose of division of labor and cooperation. Taking the precedents in this city as an example, such as the Transportation Industry Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association on both roads and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of various universities and middle schools in the academic community, it is true that anti-Japanese national salvation is a task that all citizens should fulfill, and it is valuable for everyone to do their best. Although the organization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this city is formed by gathering all sectors, on the one hand, each has its own business, and the spirit is inevitably restrained. On the other hand, each sector has its own strengths. For example, the industrial sector uses its spirit of daring to act and make efforts to produce and plant the foundation for national salvation. The academic community uses its wisdom in planning and considering to engage in propaganda and achieve the effect of household publicity. The business community is familiar with trade conditions and commodity identification, and prevents the source of enemy goods. If each has an individual organization within the scope of its profession, then people will be spared from wasting their time with expertise, and things will be specialized and orderly. The policies and actions of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this city are still whole, and on the one hand, it can avoid the reason for separation and delay. Moreover, the enemy's slander against our country's Anti-Japanese National Salvation cause is always that its affairs come from various sectors and organizations and have a coercive nature, and it uses all means to slander it. The general will is weak, and they deeply believe it. If this kind of fallacy is allowed to spread, it will not only sow discord and create a situation of fire and water, but the great cause of anti-Japanese national salvation may be buried invisibly. To correct this fallacy, we must change the organization and transform the plan for economic severance with Japan into a public agreement of merchants and regulations of the industry, without containing any coercive nature from the outside world. The separators have nothing to do with their skills. This is especially a great key to the continued struggle for anti-Japanese national salvation. May our business community and all sectors understand this purpose. Moreover, some outsiders may have doubts about this organization, thinking that self-protection is a basic human psychology. This organization of the business community may have the opposite effect on the cause of anti-Japanese national salvation. This association dares to tell all sectors directly that since merchants automatically implemented economic severance with Japan, such as the Textile Industry Association, the Cotton Industry Association, the Color Printing Industry Association, and the recent Coal Industry Association, they have all made every effort to report Japanese goods, or the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this city has a record to check, or the details have been seen in the local newspapers. As for the matter of merchants violating public agreements, it may also be frequent, but this is the action of private individuals, not the behavior of the group, and the association has no favoritism for these actions. What is there to fear? The country cannot therefore doubt the organization of this association because of the merchants. The above-mentioned past events can be a clear proof of the time to today. It is difficult to be afraid. People's livelihood is difficult. This association can only dedicate its blood and cooperate with people from all walks of life in the progress of anti-Japanese national salvation. On the one hand, it aims to avoid unnecessary sacrifices in the business community. On the other hand, it aims to achieve permanent success in boycotting goods. At the beginning of this resolution to organize, I would like to state the purpose to inform the society.</p>
<h3 id="e141">All Sectors Strive for Sovereignty in the Case of Coal Industry Inspectors Being Arrested <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yan Bin Was Found Not Guilty by Court Verdict</p>
<p>The Coal Industry Announces Resumption of Business from Today</p>
<p>Over 1,800 coal businesses in this city unanimously suspended business due to the Yongchang Coal Company's destruction of the patriotic movement and the arrest of inspector Yan Bin, as resolved by the general meeting. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Taxpayer's Association, and other organizations sent letters to the Municipal Council questioning the extra-jurisdictional arrest of the inspector and issued declarations to strive for sovereignty. The court yesterday ruled Yan Bin not guilty and ordered his release on bail. The police department disagreed and planned to appeal. The Coal Industry Association issued a notice yesterday stating that all businesses would resume operation today. The various situations are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, through a temporary meeting of representatives, issued a declaration to assist Yan Bin, the inspector of the Japanese goods inspection team of the Coal Industry Association, who was arrested for inspecting and finding Yongchang Coal Company's private entry of Japanese coal. The declaration stated that since the violent Japan occupied Shenyang on September 18 last year, its violence and conspiracies have been advancing without end. The territory of the three northeastern provinces is entirely under its control. Our merchants and people, unable to endure it any longer, established the organization of the Committee for Economic Severance with Japan. Various industries have formulated their own public agreements to prevent the industry from privately importing Japanese goods and have established their own inspection teams of Japanese goods to avoid the few bad apples from undermining the public agreement. Since the implementation of inspections by various industries, although there have been those who dared to risk impropriety, engage in private embezzlement, and bite back, they ultimately fear public opinion and their conscience has not been completely lost. Therefore, once questioned by the public, they still know to repent. There has never been anyone as extreme as Yongchang Coal Company, a member of the Coal Industry Association, who willingly colludes with foreigners to exalt itself, destroys the public agreement of the association to stop purchasing Japanese coal, and accuses the industry of enforcing the regulations of public agreement as robbery. We want to tell this company that it should know that the patriotic people in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, which have fallen under the iron hooves of the national enemy, are still able to organize volunteer armies and make a final stand against the violent Japan, shattering their bones and disregarding everything. We are watching the fire from across the river, hoping to share the enemy's leftovers to nourish ourselves. Anyone with a human heart cannot bear to do this. We want to tell the law enforcement officials and foreign merchants residing in Shanghai that the regulations publicly determined by the group have the obligation to force the members of the group to comply. This is a common principle of the world law. Therefore, this action, even from the perspective of the law, does not violate the essence of the rule of law and cannot be considered an obstruction to commercial freedom. Moreover, economic blockade to sanction a country that uses military force has been adopted by the international covenant and is publicly recognized by countries around the world. The exercise of this kind of national self-defense right transcends ordinary legal concepts. Friendly foreigners in Shanghai should also base themselves on international justice and broad sympathy and not be fooled by the one-sided dregs of our country, so as not to damage their feelings towards China. In short, our colleagues in this association believe that implementing economic severance with Japan is the minimum limit for the people to exercise their right to self-defense. If there is anyone who undermines it, no matter where they come from, we will fight to the end and will not hesitate to make any sacrifice. This is a special declaration.</p>
<p>Letter to the British Chamber of Commerce The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the British Chamber of Commerce, stating that since the Shenyang Incident on September 18 last year, the Shanghai coal industry has agreed not to import Japanese coal. This coal industry inspection team was established by the industry itself to sanction its colleagues who violate the public agreement. Since Yongchang Coal Company is a colleague and has been found to have violated the public agreement, the industry has the right to give it appropriate treatment. This matter has nothing to do with British merchants. It is regrettable that there have been reports that Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. has intervened. Since the Shenyang Incident in our country, the friendly attitude of the British government and people has left a deep impression on the people of our country, and British commercial activity with China has made good progress. This is very fortunate for the future of our country. We urge your association to advise Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. not to participate in the efforts of our merchants to sanction colleagues according to public justice, so as to avoid misunderstandings. This is a matter of great concern. This is addressed to the British Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Letter to the Special District Court The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the First Special District Court of Jiangsu Shanghai, stating that the organization of self-inspection teams of Japanese goods by various industries to cooperate with the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this city was resolved by the temporary meeting of representatives of the Chamber of Commerce in July last year, and letters were sent to various industries limiting the time to organize, so as to supplement the deficiencies of the Anti-Japanese Association. All industries have been organized according to the case, and the exercise of inspection powers is limited to their own industries. Since Shenyang was occupied by Japan, all firms have stopped importing Japanese coal, which has long been resolved by the industry. The industry has the right to severely punish colleagues who violate the public agreement according to commercial custom. Yan Bin, the inspector of the inspection team of the industry, is performing his duties under the order of the association. The coal obtained from the inspection is still sent to the association for handling according to the regulations and is not transferred to private ownership. There is no reason to be liable for crimes. A letter is sent accordingly for investigation. This is addressed to the First Special District Court of Jiangsu Shanghai.</p>
<p>Dispute of the Taxpayer's Association The Taxpayer's Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, stating that the incident occurred in the Suzhou River, which is not within the jurisdiction of your bureau's police power according to law. Even if the coal is really the property of Mackinnon, Mackinnon should sue the Coal Industry Association and the inspector in the court with jurisdiction. The detention of Japanese goods transported by Wu Jichang is a movement of our people against the violent Japan. Your bureau has repeatedly stated neutrality, but indirectly or directly promotes the violent Japan everywhere. Is it that the May 30th Massacre, which was left unfinished in 1925, is still not enough? Or are you afraid of the brutality of the violent Japan and fear that it will repeat the siege of the Hongkou Police Station? Your bureau should immediately withdraw the public prosecution in this case in order to comply with the law and strictly maintain neutrality. Please reply to the previous reason accordingly. I hope you will check it.</p>

As for the coal industry market on Zhijiang Road, it is scheduled to resume business from today. The cargo loading and unloading in the warehouses in Pudong will be completely as usual from today. The sales points of the Kailuan Mining Bureau will also sell as usual from today.</p>
<p>Resumption of Business in the Charcoal Barge Industry The City's Charcoal Industry Association believes that it is connected to the coal industry and that it is in the same boat. The general meeting resolved to unanimously suspend business to provide assistance. After receiving the notice from the Coal Industry Association yesterday, it notified all colleagues that all businesses would resume operation from today. The City's Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association also suspended coal barging work for the sake of assistance because the coal industry was suspended. Yesterday, because the coal industry had been satisfactorily resolved, it notified all colleagues that all coal barging would resume as usual from today.</p>

<p>The Courtroom Was Overcrowded</p>
<p>Over a Hundred People Waited for News Outside the Courthouse</p>
<p>The Lawyer's Eloquent Defense Lasted Two Hours</p>
<p>Yan Bin Was Acquitted in Court</p>
<p>Yan Bin (also known as Yan Bing), the investigator of the investigation section of the Coal Industry Association, was ordered by the association on the 11th of this month to investigate the private transportation of Japanese coal by the unscrupulous merchant Yongchang Coal Company, which resulted in collusion with the British firm Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co.'s manager, Mr. Mackinnon, who reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. On the 17th, the Chinese and Western detectives arrested Yan. The next morning, he was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and was temporarily detained. All this has been recorded in this newspaper. Since Yan was detained, all sectors have rallied to help because Yan was implicated in the matter due to public affairs. The charcoal industry and the barge industry also joined the suspension of business for two days to show their determination. Yesterday morning was the date for the trial of this case. Around 9:00 AM, coal industry colleagues came to the court to listen to the proceedings one after another, so that the second courtroom suddenly became overcrowded, and those who arrived later were still coming in an endless stream. The court and the police department, in order to maintain order, dispatched judicial police and Chinese and Western detectives to guard the courtroom entrance and the stairs of the third courtroom to prevent the crowds who arrived later from entering. As a result, there were about a hundred people standing in the courtyard of the court waiting for news, and the order was slightly chaotic. The case was heard by Judge Feng Shide from 10:00 AM and lasted for four hours. It was not until 2:00 PM that the debate ended and the defendant Yan Bin was acquitted in court. The trial of this case is recorded below.</p>
<p>Police Lawyer's Presentation of the Case At around 10:00 AM, Judge Feng ordered the defendant Yan Bin to be brought to the case. Yan still hired three lawyers, Chen Wen, Xue Jiaqi, and Wang Zuxun, to appear in court to defend him. Then, the police lawyers Bo Liang and Wang Yaotang began to say that the police department is now accusing the defendant of conspiring to rob a lighter owned by the British firm Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. on the Mackinnon Road Wharf at 2:00 PM on January 11, containing over tons of coal worth 750 yuan, and filed a public prosecution for the crime of conspiracy to rob under Article 348 of the Criminal Law. They also detailed the course of the case, saying that the British merchant Mackinnon, the owner of Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co., had ordered 50 tons of coal from the Japanese firm Mitsui &amp; Co. in Pudong.</p>
<p>Five Detained People Were Ordered to Be Released It was then reported that Mackinnon reported to the police department, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the Second District Fourth Branch of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau. The director of the branch tried to bring five people from the Coal Industry Association to the Public Security Bureau. The five people, named Ye Yongfu, Ye Shengchao, Xia Yisheng, Yan Bin, and one other person whose name is unknown, all admitted at the time that they had pushed the boat away. The detectives then requested permission to temporarily detain them until 8:00 PM, when a reply would be given so that they could return to the police station to discuss the solution. When the Chinese and Western detectives inquired by telephone to the Public Security Bureau at 8:00 PM, they were informed that the five people had been released by order of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The detectives had to request the court to issue an arrest warrant to detain Yan Bin and copied out a badge.</p>
<p>The Police Presented Four Pieces of Evidence Now the police have four pieces of evidence to present: 1) the contract between Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. and Mitsui &amp; Co. to purchase coal; 2) the lease contract between Mackinnon and Wu Yongchang to rent a warehouse; 3) the Coal Industry Association sent a letter to the Gordon Road Police Station admitting to the transportation of coal after the incident; 4) the Shanghai Citizens' Punishment Association sent a letter to the Laofengxiang Silver Building on Xinzha Road, threatening to destroy the neighboring Wu Yongchang Coal Company. There are also the testimonies of various witnesses presented to the court for investigation.</p>
<p>The Englishman Mackinnon Was Investigated Separately Then the British businessman Mackinnon testified and translated that he was a coal merchant and also ran Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. On the 10th of this month, I ordered 3,300 tons of coal from the Japanese firm Mitsui &amp; Co. Wu Yongchang Coal Company came forward to rent a lighter from Wu Jingen to transport it. At this point, the defendant's lawyer stood up and requested that the witnesses in this case be investigated separately. The court approved it. Then, Judge Feng asked Mackinnon: Did you sign a contract with Wu Yongchang Coal Company to rent a warehouse? He answered yes, with a monthly rent of 60 yuan for a term of six months. Asked if you had an order to purchase coal from Mitsui &amp; Co.? He answered that because there was also a Japanese named Yimale who acted as an intermediary, there was no order. Asked if the bill of lading was given to Wu Yongchang by? He answered yes. Asked how much cargo was on the bill? He answered fifty tons. Asked where your warehouse is? He answered in the alley near 700 of Carter Road, with my Mackinnon name sign at the door. Asked where the coal ship was berthed? He answered near the Chinese Commercial Bank, near the concession. Asked when you were at the pier? Answered around 1:00 PM in the afternoon. At that time, there were two Chinese and also local news on the following page.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Local News Two <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>A person arrived, claiming to be sent by the Coal Industry Association to investigate the goods. I questioned him about his credentials, and the two people said they had none. As I was about to arrest them, the two people then said to me, "Since the coal belongs to you, we will report the situation to the association." After saying this, they left. I waited until 1:40, seeing no movement, I declared to Chinese Constable No. 1044 on duty that the coal was mine, and then went back. Around 2 o'clock, I received a report saying that the coal had been taken away by the Anti-Japanese Association, and that the constable on duty had already left his post, leading to this incident. I immediately reported it to the police station, and so on. After finishing, the defendant's lawyer cross-examined Mr. Mac.</p>
<p>Yan Bin confessed the whole story. Upon questioning the defendant Yan Bing, he stated that this batch of Japanese coal was first discovered by the Anti-Japanese Association. Because the Anti-Japanese Association had no storage facilities, after discussion with the Coal Industry Association, they borrowed the Yitai Xing West Warehouse, which also belonged to a member of the Coal Industry Association. The investigation section chief, Wang, sent me to the Yitai Xing West Warehouse to register the amount of coal. When I arrived, the ship had not yet arrived, so I went along the river to inspect the area near the Sampan Factory New Bridge. I did not board the ship. Later, the ship was steered by the Tang family and others from the Anti-Japanese Association to the warehouse to unload. There were a total of ten tons and one hundred catties of coal, which are now all stored in the Yitai Xing West Warehouse, and so on.</p>
<p>Three witnesses successively testified. According to witness Mei Zenggui, he works as a shipmate for Wu Jingen. I was responsible for transporting the coal. The ship arrived at the Sampan Factory New Bridge and docked to unload the cargo. There were a total of fifty tons of coal. At that time, thirty-six tons were unloaded, and there were still fourteen tons. Just as we were about to unload, more than ten staff members of the Anti-Japanese Association arrived and stopped the unloading, and cursed loudly, steering the ship to the north of the creek. The defendant was not on the scene at that time. Only when we reached the Yitai Xing West Warehouse did I see the defendant and seven or eight people steering the ship together, and so on. According to witness Qi Yulin, sixteen years old, an apprentice at Wu Yongchang Company, at that time, ten staff members of the Anti-Japanese Association pointed to the coal as Japanese goods, so they steered the ship to the north of the creek. However, I did not see the defendant at that time. According to witness Wu Jingen, he gave his testimony, but was not very clear about this case and had nothing to prove.</p>
<p>The lawyer raised the issue of jurisdiction. The defendant's lawyer, Xue Jiaqi, then raised the issue of jurisdiction, saying that according to Article 5 of the agreement, the police station can only prosecute those who commit crimes within the concession. The place where this case occurred belongs to the Chinese territory, because the ship was docked in the Suzhou River, and the Suzhou River belongs to the Chinese territory, so the police station has no right to prosecute. According to Article 318 of the Criminal Procedure Law, it should be declared inadmissible.</p>
<p>Both sides debated for two hours. At this point, the witness testimony was completed. Judge Feng instructed to begin the debate. The police station lawyer and the defendant's lawyer then debated for a long time. The debate over the issue of jurisdiction was quite fierce, lasting about two hours, before each finished their argument. Finally, Prosecutor Li Ying expressed his opinion. Judge Feng declared the debate concluded and announced the verdict in court: The defendant Yan Bin was innocent. He was to provide bail within the appeal period. After the pronouncement, because the defendant's side had already prepared the guarantee, as soon as they heard the order to release him on bail, the coal industry colleagues in the audience applauded and cheered. They immediately hired a car, with a piece of white cloth bearing the words "Welcome Comrade Yan Bin out of prison" as a banner hung on the front of the car. They embraced Yan, got into the car, and sped away from the court.</p>

<p>Declaration The Shanghai National Crisis Relief Association meets with compatriots across the country. On the day of this meeting, a declaration should be made to serve as a lesson. For twenty years, warlords have been in internal strife, and bandits have ravaged the country. This is a national crisis. Floods have caused disasters, and famine victims are everywhere in seventeen provinces. This is a national crisis. Violent Japan has invaded the Northeast region, and territory has been broken. This is a national crisis. Any one of these three national crises, as long as the country still has its people, and the people still have their country, must not be allowed to happen, and even more must not be allowed to exist. But now all three are combined. Who is doing this? Who caused it? It is the citizens who are doing it, and the citizens who caused it. The country does not belong to a few people, and the people do not belong to a few people. Citizens all have sovereignty and all have responsibility. The citizens should restrain the warlords in internal strife. The citizens should prevent the floods that cause disasters. The citizens should punish the violent Japan that invades. But now the citizens blame the government, and the government shirks responsibility. Alas, what kind of talk is this? It is a mistake, a mistake. If the citizens are capable, then the government is capable. If the government is capable, then the three ministers are capable. The capability does not belong to the three ministers, and the capability of the government is not the capability of the citizens. The capability of the citizens is the true capability. The capability of the government and the capability of the three ministers is only the capability of the citizens. The national crisis is urgent. If the citizens do not each do their best, "obligation comes first, and rights come later," the destruction of the country and the extinction of the race will be imminent. Nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood are merely empty talk on paper. Therefore, this association was founded. The colleagues of the association have publicly agreed to establish the Shanghai National Crisis Relief Association, standing on the position of citizens, with a bright and upright spirit, and with the pure and devoted purpose of public service, to relieve the national crisis, complete national sovereignty, and realize democratic politics. Even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, this determination will not change. This is used as a declaration for your review. January 20, 1932.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Government To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nanjing National Government: Ever since violent Japan invaded the three northeastern provinces, it has been four months now. Our country has been busy with peace talks and reorganizations, which has further emboldened violent Japan to make arrangements for aggression. Relying on the League of Nations has resulted in the loss of Jinzhou and the danger of Yuguan. Recently, it is even proposed to ask the League of Nations to use Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant and ask the United States to convene the Nine-Power Treaty. As a result, the national army has stationed troops inside the pass, making noise about salaries and sitting idle, allowing the Northeast Volunteers to run out of food and ammunition, starving and thinly clad, without providing assistance. Government officials, running around on the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Guangdong roads, only do their best to smooth out opinions, viewing the three northeastern provinces as the people of Yue view the leanness and fatness of the people of Qin. To try not to perish is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Shanghai is the economic center of the country and the hub of international trade. Since suffering from the global economic recession, the floods in various provinces, and the violent Japanese invasion of the Northeast, business has plummeted and factories have closed one after another. Financial resources have dried up. It is difficult to describe completely. If there is no definite policy internally or externally for a long time, and only endless litigation and numerous talks are held in the court, I am afraid that it will not be enough to save the country, but will only hasten its demise. Those who are in a position to be responsible should broaden their horizons, put obligations first, and put rights later. Publish government affairs to public opinion and immediately make decisions in the people's representative organs, so that we can save the country from danger by any chance. Otherwise, if we continue to be indecisive and lack the courage to act swiftly, there will be no turning point in Shanghai's situation, and the violent Japan will only have to sit and wait to reap the fruits. This is a special telegram for your consideration. The Shanghai National Crisis Relief Association bows, seal.</p>

We urge everyone to unite in organization, take active action, and jointly seek to relieve the national crisis. In closing the telegram, we cannot express our prayers enough. The Shanghai National Crisis Relief Association bows, seal.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Testimony of Witnesses in the Chen Xing Marriage Dispute <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Fu Rui Proves He Did Not Marry Yan Shufen</p>
<p>Sheng Sangshi Narrates Funding Chen Xing's University Education</p>
<p>Sang Gushi Says Both Sides Were Very Harmonious at First</p>
<p>Judge Urges Chen Xing to Reconcile</p>
<p>Miss Yan Shufen, the cousin of Yan Dunyuan, the former Minister of the Interior of the Beijing Government, was engaged to Chen Xing (courtesy name Jian'an), the recently discharged Vice President of the Central Bank, in 1912 through matchmakers Chen Handi and Ye Shuheng. At that time, Chen had just graduated from middle school and planned to discontinue his studies due to poverty. Her parents-in-law intended to cultivate him and provided him with funds to continue his studies. After graduating from university in 1919, he went to study in Jiang State, and the Yue family continued to assist him. Unexpectedly, after Chen went abroad, he married a Miss Cai in the United States, disregarding the previous agreement. After returning from the United States, Miss Yan repeatedly ordered him to fulfill the agreement and hold the wedding, but Chen repeatedly shirked and procrastinated. Now the woman is forty-two years old and it is difficult to delay any longer. Therefore, she came to Shanghai last year to negotiate with him, but Chen refused to see her. The woman then sued in court, demanding compensation for the loss of breach of marriage contract of 100,000 foreign dollars, and the 25,000 dollars advanced for tuition fees. During the initial trial, Chen claimed that Yan Shufen had written to him when she was studying at Jinghai Girls' School in Suzhou, stating that she was unwilling to marry him. Later, she married Chuan Rui (courtesy name Wutui), the nephew of the former Shanghai Daoyin, in Beijing. The amount of tuition fees assisted by the Yan family was also inconsistent with what was claimed and had been repaid after returning to China. The judge recognized that the defendant's defense was well-founded and rejected the original lawsuit. However, Yan Shufen did not accept the entire judgment and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, requesting a reversal. During one hearing, Chen, who was still the Vice President, did not attend the trial. Tao Changshan, who claimed to be working in the Ministry of Finance, and Zhu Dazhai, the assistant manager of the City Bank, came to court to testify that when Miss Yan married Chuan Wutui in Beijing, they all went to congratulate her, so the marriage was indeed a fact. However, after sending the couple to the bridal chamber, the newly married couple suddenly quarreled and divorced immediately. When questioned about Yan Shufen, she categorically denied marrying Chuan Rui. Judge Shen then ordered the two parties to go out for reconciliation and continue to investigate evidence for verification. The details were reported earlier. Now that a long time has passed, and the two parties have made no progress in reconciliation, Judge Shen Hong specially opened an investigation court yesterday afternoon to summon witnesses for questioning. The witnesses summoned were Fu Rui, Sheng Sangshi, and Sang Gushi, all of whom belonged to the appellant's side. Fu Rui originally worked in a coal mine company in Liaoning. This time, because Tao Changshan and others said in court that he had married Miss Yan, he was specially notified by Ye Shuheng to come from Liaoning to prove the truth. As for the appellee Chen Xing, after being dismissed from the position of Vice President of the Central Bank, he had returned to his hometown of Shangyu and only hired lawyer Zhang Zhirang to represent him in court, stating that since he was involved in litigation, he could only wait for the legal decision. Lawyer Jiang immediately requested the court to summon witnesses. Therefore, Fu Rui was first summoned and testified that he was forty-five years old, from Hangzhou, and was an engineer. In 1921, he was engaged to Miss Yan through his uncle. Our matchmaker was Chen Handi, and the female matchmaker was Ye Shuheng. Then, the wedding date was chosen. Unexpectedly, when the auspicious day arrived and the guests all arrived, the bride firmly refused to board the sedan chair until late at night, so the wedding could not be held. The next day, I asked the matchmaker to negotiate, but only learned that Miss Yan was unwilling to marry. I did not know why she was unwilling. At that time, relatives and friends repeatedly persuaded her, and I also believed that marriage should not be forced, so I unconditionally terminated the engagement. Recently, I learned about this case from the newspaper and learned that Miss Yan refused to marry at the beginning. Ye Shuheng also wrote to me, urging me to testify, saying that he treated Chen exceptionally well in the past and assisted him in everything. Even Chen's examination papers in his early years were prepared for him. Now that he has become rich, he has forgotten the past, stopped his wife and remarried. Please take the time to go to Shanghai to prove the truth. Therefore, I specially came to court. Miss Yan is the first time I have met her in Shanghai. I am not familiar with Tao Changshan, Zhu Dazhai, and others who came to court last time. Their statement that I married Miss Yan is truly incomprehensible. The current society is dirty. There is no shortage of people who curry favor with the powerful. Please make a clear judgment. Next, Sheng Sangshi testified that Shufen's mother was my cousin. After Chen Xing graduated from middle school, his aunt already regarded Shufen as his beloved son-in-law because his family was poor and unable to make progress, so she ordered him to continue his studies and helped him with funds. In 1916, his aunt was critically ill and left a will that Chen Xing must be harmonious with Shufen in the future and treat his grandchildren well. His aunt once said that she provided Chen Xing with no less than 20,000 yuan. Next, Sang Gushi testified that Shufen was my niece and I am her mother's sister-in-law. At first, Shufen's letter to Chen Xing stating that she was unwilling to marry was actually intended to encourage Chen to concentrate on his studies and achieve fame early. I also repeatedly witnessed the assistance funds. After Chen returned from studying abroad, his relationship with Shufen was very harmonious at first. When Shufen lived in Tianji Lane, Baoshan Road, she once hosted a banquet for him and discussed the marriage with each other. After Judge Shen questioned this point, he was very clear about the facts. He then instructed Chen's lawyer to tell Chen Xing not to be stubborn and to reconcile with the appellant. The case was allowed to be extended again for review.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Corps has been established for four months now. More than 700 members of the Corps go to the north and south cities every day to practice without interruption. Their spirit is high and their progress is quite rapid. The Corps Commander, Mr. Zhang Kechang, recently felt that the national crisis was becoming more urgent. He specially ordered all members of the Corps to intensify their training and prepare to kill enemies for the country. He also instructed all instructors to supervise the teaching conscientiously and raise military equipment for formal military training. Before the real guns were obtained, hundreds of wooden guns were purchased and started gun exercises on the 18th. It is said that in order to practically learn military knowledge, the Corps plans to conduct field or long-distance exercises. In addition, surveying of battlefields and communications and telecommunications are also being planned.</p>

<p>Zhao Xintai Construction Company Wins the Bid</p>
<p>Construction Cost 382,000 Taels of Silver</p>
<p>The China Reclamation Bank was founded by Qin Runqing, Wang Boyuan, Xu Jiying, Li Fushun, Zhou Zongliang, Liang Chenlan, and other giants of the financial industry in this city. It collected a full capital of 2.5 million silver dollars in one go. Since its establishment, it has been three years, and its business has become increasingly developed, so that the old buildings on Ningbo Road feel cramped and insufficient for office use. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided to purchase a base of one mu and three fen at the corner of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road, valued at 250,000 taels of silver. Tonghe Foreign Company designed and built an eight-story mansion. Bids were invited at the end of last year. As a result, Zhao Xintai Construction Company won the bid with a construction cost of 382,000 taels of silver. At present, the project has started. The bank plans to reserve the ground floor and the first and second floors for its own use. All equipment will be extensively adopted from the latest Chinese and foreign bank buildings to ensure that both itself and customers feel comfortable and convenient. The remaining floors will be rented out as office space, and so on.</p>

<p>Breaks Glass Windows Silently</p>
<p>Has Stolen Before and After More Than Ten Times</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that in the past thirty days, a clever thief, or perhaps several accomplices, has been stealing from the front and back of foreign residences in the western district more than ten times. The total loss of each owner is estimated to be as high as 15,000 yuan. Once, a German's leather coat was stolen, which was said to be worth more than 6,000 yuan. On Tuesday morning, the thief stole clothes worth 100 yuan from No. 1, Da Xiqu. The thief steals by breaking glass windows to enter people's homes. His technique is very clever, so that people in the house do not hear the sound. The Western District Police Station investigated the stolen households and saw that the thief's entry methods were the same, so they dared to conclude that it was done by one person. After many days of investigation, there are now some clues, and it is expected that the thief can be arrested within a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Bandit Who Injured the Car Exhibitor Seriously Was Sentenced After Recovery <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months in Prison</p>
<p>Liu Yunsheng, 33 years old, a former coachman living at No. 23 Jin Yi Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, learned on the morning of October 27 last year that Qiu Songlin had more than 1,000 yuan in cash in Liangqinfang, Lafayette Road, and was transporting it to a certain place. He immediately gathered three or four accomplices to hold weapons and wait at the entrance of Liangqinfang. Seeing Qiu ordering people to lift the silver box onto the car, they rushed forward to rob it. Fortunately, the coachman saw the opportunity and drove forward at full speed, and was not robbed. At that time, the police whistle sounded and the accomplices fled without a trace. However, Liu had jumped onto the car's running board. Because the car was driving fast, he was shocked and lost his footing. He fell at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Xiai Road and was injured. His abdomen ruptured and his intestines flowed out. The police brought Liu into the police station and transferred him to Renji Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the victim reported the situation to the police station and asked for an investigation. The details were recorded in previous reports. By December 30, Liu had recovered from his illness and was brought back to the police station by the detective and sent to the Second Special Court. He was prosecuted for attempted robbery under Article 348 of the Criminal Law. Judge Luo Renji opened the court for questioning many times. The victim had left Shanghai and did not arrive. When questioning the defendant, he denied gathering accomplices to rob and claimed that he was injured by the car. According to the victim's bodyguard and the doorman of Liangqinfang, they arrived to testify that they had witnessed the defendant jumping on the car. The defendant hired a lawyer to defend him. The court ordered the trial to be concluded and scheduled a sentencing date. Yesterday was the sentencing date. At 10:00 AM, Judge Luo attended the Criminal Division 1 court and ordered the defendant to be brought to court. Liu Yunsheng was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for the crime of attempted robbery by ganging up with three or more people.</p>

<p>A Cloth Belt Ended a Life</p>
<p>In Xilao, Huade Road, there was a prisoner named Su Gengsheng, a native of Jiangbei, 26 years old, who was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by the court on October 20, 1930, for the crime of theft. Su suddenly strangled himself with a cloth belt in Xilao at around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday. Chinese Constable No. 3, who was in charge of the prison, found it and tried to take him down, but he had already died. The body was carried to the Feilun Road Examination Office. Yesterday morning, Guo Huaipu, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, came to the office to examine and clarify the case. According to the Chinese Constable's report on the situation at that time, Mr. Guo then instructed the examination to find that the deceased prisoner Su Gengsheng had indeed died by hanging himself before his death. The corpse was collected by the corpse uncle Su Yingting for coffin burial.</p>

<p>Came to Court Yesterday to Prove Everything</p>
<p>On the night of the 10th of this month, the home of Wang Yu, a resident of 71 Tai'an Lane, North Shanxi Road, was robbed by bandits, who sent a letter demanding a huge ransom. They also agreed to meet at the entrance of the Anle Palace Hotel on Edouard Road at 8:30 the night before yesterday to negotiate. The Huishi Police Station learned of this and sent detectives to arrest them, resulting in a shootout. As a result, two bandits, Xiao Wang and Li, were shot and killed on the spot. Jiang Dinghui, a native of Shaoxing, was captured. The bodies of the two bandits were carried to the Feilun Road Examination Office. Yesterday morning, Guo Huaipu, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, came to the office to examine and clarify the case. According to Wang Yu, her husband had passed away and was previously engaged in the gold business. The two dead bandits were indeed the people who kidnapped me. Then, Chinese and Western detectives reported the course of the armed fight at that time. Mr. Guo verified the confession and then instructed the examination to find that the two dead bandits had indeed been shot dead by the detectives before their death. The corpses were coffined by Pushan Villa. After the detectives and the bandits fought, the bandits knew that the matter was defeated and the arrest was very tight, so they released the hostage Wang Yu and sent her home at 9:00 PM the night before yesterday, so she was able to come out and testify today. At midnight last night, Chinese Detective Feng Baishun and Detective Yan Wu continued to arrest two suspects, Wang Xianqiao and Zhang Maoxi, in Room 20, Qixin Hotel, Fuzhou Road. They were taken back to the police station for questioning. They denied being bandits and sued the police chief, who ordered them to be detained for investigation.</p>

<p>Gout is a condition caused by deficiency of qi and blood, excessive mental strain, weakened spirit, and the invasion of wind and dampness into the bones. This leads to symptoms such as sore bones, numbness in the limbs, hemiplegia, and difficulty walking. If left untreated, it can spread, causing wind and dampness to penetrate the bones, posing a threat to life. Now, the Xiong Biao Brand medicinal wine for treating painful gout, invented by the Xiaoxiantang Pharmacy in Fushoufang, outside the South City Xiaoximen, specializes in treating both new and chronic gout, sore limbs, numb hands and feet, and hemiplegia. Regular consumption can transform weakness into strength. Furthermore, if the medicinal wine is heated and rubbed on the affected area, its effect is miraculous, it is said.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read in yesterday's newspaper about the preparatory committee of the Shenxin No. 6 Cotton Mill holding a meeting, with Wu Xiaozhi as chairman, we would like to clarify that the workers of our mill, feeling the need to organize a trade union, previously elected several representatives to hold a preparatory meeting at the Hudong District Cotton Mill Union in the Shezhuang Temple of the Wang Family Residence, west of Gao Laobridge. There were no other organizations or activities. As for Mr. Wu, he is not a worker of our mill. How could he lead the workers of our mill to organize? We hope you will publish this letter in the letter column to clarify the truth and avoid confusing the public.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Having read in today's newspaper's local news column the "Declaration of the Federation of Trade Unions," which included the name of the Municipal Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, we would like to clarify that in this city, the only pharmaceutical workers' organization is our "Shanghai Pharmaceutical Vocational Union." There is no other trade union under that name. However, our union did not send representatives to participate in the Federation of Trade Unions, nor did we receive any notification. Fearing that this may cause confusion among the public, we have specially prepared this letter for correction. We request that it be published in the letter column. Thank you.</p>

<p>Having read yesterday's local news in your newspaper regarding the news item of (Zhang Xilin Kidnapping Case, Four Bandits Sentenced to Death), it mentions the lawyer of the police station, Ru Bao Yi, stating that although the defendant Wang Xingcun was declared not guilty, in the self-accusation of the encroachment case, "it was the Anhui Fellow Association who accused him" and that he was sentenced to four months in prison. We are extremely surprised. Wang Xingcun is a member of our association. Last October, he was mistakenly detained by the police station. We sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Court to prove that Wang was a kind and law-abiding fellow villager who was falsely accused. We requested a fair trial and release. At the same time, we also proved that other fellow villagers who were mistakenly detained in the same case had been released. All are on record. There is no reason to accuse Wang Xingcun. The report is misleading and we request a correction. Thank you.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Answers Regarding Student Work <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Hansheng</p>
<p>Since the national crisis occurred, most of the people across the country have been living in anger, depression, resentment, and confusion, especially the young students who are most rich in emotion. They resent the brutality of Japanese imperialism and the incompetence of the League of Nations, but they resent even more the military non-resistance and diplomatic helplessness of the government authorities that maintain two million soldiers. However, in utter disappointment, they once enthusiastically went to various places to promote their cause, they once lingered on the streets to raise donations, they once organized volunteer armies, they once endured hunger and cold to petition the government in the capital, and they once engaged in "venting" work such as marches, demonstrations, posting slogans, and shouting slogans. Finally, they painfully went on strike, wanting to awaken the government, but in fact, the facts tell us that in the past three or four months, they not only failed to achieve the goal of saving the country, but also sacrificed a lot of precious time, earned a tired heart, and fell into a path of disappointment and negativity. We know that the young students of the May Fourth and May Eighth Movements are now the people in charge in politics and society. Their patriotic enthusiasm and determination to save the country at that time were no less than those of the average young student today. However, because they refused to enrich their own learning and refused to do practical work, when they took office, they were the same as the people they hated before, and were hated by others, resulting in the current situation of internal and external troubles. Therefore, in the future, we should no longer follow the same path as before. I think what young students should strive for now is not to petition the government or declare war on Japan, nor to engage in bare-handed military training. The most practical work is to "go deep into the people to awaken the masses and organize the masses," because if national affairs rely only on the ruling class and the intellectual class, it is absolutely impossible. Unless four hundred million idiots take responsibility, China will never be strong. This great and meaningful work can only be done by young students, and only young students are willing to do it. Therefore, young students should not be afraid of difficulties and do this work to make it happen as soon as possible. I dare to guarantee that "if four hundred million idiots are awakened, their amazing power will surely shake the world and make the imperialists pale in fright."</p>
<p>In addition to doing this work, we should also enrich our own knowledge, because to maintain a great nation in the world, to build a strong country, we must have sufficient academic preparation. The reason why Japan is so strong is also the result of their efforts in academics in the last fifty or sixty years. It is better to say that Japan occupied our Northeast with academics than to say that they occupied our Northeast with military force this time. Bacon of England said, "Knowledge is power." This is not a bad word. Looking at the world today, no matter what powerful tools are manufactured and used in wartime or peacetime, none of them are not related to the level of knowledge. Therefore, improving knowledge is a permanent work of resisting insults. In the future, we should strive towards this goal. Overthrowing imperialism cannot be achieved by temporary emotions. Noisy shouts and aimless wandering will only disappoint us. We have the spirit of "swallowing blood and teeth" as Zeng Guofan said, and with a twelve-point serious sense of responsibility, we firmly and vigorously recognize the goal and strive forward. We will eventually have a day of victory. (B)</p>

<h3 id="e165">Lucky New Route <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's newspaper, the Yangtze River route has been obstructed since October last year. The water is shallow and the shoals are high, and large ships of 5,000 tons or more cannot sail. Therefore, large ships have been suspended for several months. As a result of careful and precise measurements by customs officials, a new route was discovered with 15 feet of deep water that can be navigated without obstruction. Reading this news made me have a little thought.</p>
<p>The National Government is like the engine room of a ship, the government authorities are like the engineers on the ship, and we ordinary people are like the passengers on the ship. We only know that we want to go to our destination. Our destination is to live and work in peace, without being infringed upon by other countries from the outside, and without being persecuted by hunger and calamity from the inside. This is the only hope of the ordinary people for the government. It is like the passengers on the ship hoping that the engineers will not go the wrong route, so that the ship sinks and people drown.</p>
<p>But at present, we seem to feel that the route taken by the engineers on our ship is not quite correct. Perhaps it is even the wrong route. At first, we thought it was just a matter of detouring a few miles and spending a little more travel time. We still tried our best to endure it, but the situation has worsened recently. It bumped on this reef and ran aground on that shoal. The ship's body is already a little unstable. Who knew that a hurricane and storm one night, a big hole was pierced in the northeast corner of our ship's body. The terrible Eastern Ocean tide just kept rushing in. The lives of our passengers are really in extreme danger. Aren't our engineers going to give us a quick full power and correct the route?</p>
<p>If there is still a new route to be found on a Yangtze River, is it possible that there is no new route to be found in China in the vast Pacific Ocean? May our government immediately correct the route and re-establish the policy of saving the country and the people, and stop bumping into reefs and running around on shoals!</p>

<h3 id="e166">The Attic Class <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Nu</p>
<p>We know that since the imperialists brought their economic aggression that kills without bloodshed and issued the general attack order, China's society, economy, and politics have been bombed to pieces. We have seen with our own eyes that the rural economy has collapsed suddenly, and batches of vagrants have gone to the cities to concentrate. Later, China's politics could not get on the right track, and economic problems could not be solved. The number of unemployed people increased day by day, and the world's depression further sharpened it. As a result, the attic class was established.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have personally seen many friends. Since they stepped out of the school gate, they ran around everywhere and had no way out. In the end, they had no choice but to become members of the attic class. Even some of them bathed in the sea of people for a while, and because they were not used to the stinky air, they retreated to this last line of defense like defeated soldiers. Therefore, now, no matter where you go in Shanghai, north of Shanghai, east of Shanghai, or west of Shanghai, we can find the shadow of the attic, and these attics are mostly full.</p>
<p>People who live in attics are not all literary beggars. Many of them are idle after eating their fill, waiting for opportunities. Most of them are greedy for cheapness. As long as they pay a few dollars a month, one of the three major problems in life is solved. During the day, if they are happy, they may as well do it themselves, or go to a nearby restaurant. Otherwise, three sesame cakes for a meal is nothing. Although life is hard, it has never been lost in dullness; although the enjoyment of material trade is a little worse, the spirit is happy.</p>
<p>In the past, the attic was once used by proletarian writers, who were enthusiastically shouting the slogan "The workers and peasants rise up." Although the power is not so great now, we believe that many masterpieces have been drafted in the attic. Therefore, the attic class seen in academics is more meaningful than the attic class seen in ordinary times.</p>
<p>People who live in the attic can be said to be extremely comfortable. No matter how fierce the artillery fire is outside and the killing sounds are everywhere, the attic will not be destroyed by it. Therefore, the existence of the attic class is a very good phenomenon.</p>
<p>From the above discussion, we recognize that the attic is a microcosm of China's economic situation, which is absolutely true. The characters of the attic class can be regarded as examples of the bankruptcy of modern education, and finally, what makes these characters have no way out is, of course, that politics is not on the right track, industry is not prosperous, and there are all kinds of diseases. Therefore, I say that the attic can really be said to be a microcosm of the current situation in China!</p>

<h3 id="e169">How to Get Clean Water to Drink <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Xiaotao</p>
<p>If we want clean water, there are two ways: 1) Distillation. 2) Filtration. I will write them separately below...</p>
<p>1) Distillation</p>
<p>Take a flask, put five-thirds of water in the middle, and plug the mouth of the flask with a soft cork. Insert a curved glass tube in the middle of the cork. Then insert the short end of the tube into the flask, but do not reach the water surface, and extend the longer end out of the flask. Then put a section of bamboo tube on the longer end of the glass tube, and let cold water flow in the bamboo tube. Then put an empty bottle at the lower end of the glass tube and put the empty bottle in cold water. Then use fire to burn under the flask. When the water boils, the steam will escape from the glass tube, and when it meets the cold in the bamboo tube, the steam will turn into water and run from the tube into the bottle. This water is distilled water. It is necessary to change the cold water in the bamboo tube frequently to prevent it from getting hot and preventing the steam from condensing into water. This distilled water is very hygienic. Chemical reagents and hospitals use this distilled water. It takes one or two hours to distill a small cup of distilled water in the laboratory. A large amount of distilled water must be handled by the factory.</p>
<p>2) Filtration</p>
<p>Take a flower pot, and put a piece of sponge in the hole at the bottom of the flower pot (if there is no sponge, you can use loofah). Then spread a layer of charcoal chips more than an inch thick on the bottom of the pot; spread a layer of clean fine sand on the charcoal chips; and spread a layer of coarse gravel two inches thick on the fine sand. This water filter is successful. Pour the dirty water into the flower pot, and in a moment, clean water will flow out of the small hole at the bottom of the pot. It is better to boil the filtered water before drinking. The water filter should also be washed frequently to avoid unclean things remaining inside. This flower pot water filter is very practical, and it only costs three cents to make it.</p>

<p>If you want to watch a play, you don't have to spend money to go to the big stage, Tianchan Stage and other big theaters. There are plenty of them on the New World, the Great World, and all other relatively wide roads, and the plays here are not only cheap, but also have a special charm that is enough for you to savor. If you don't have any money with you, you can listen to a song for free and slip away.</p>
<p>The signboards of this theater are often open-air stage, free stage, solo stage, small stage, and people's stage. These terms are very appropriate, and open-air and free vividly depict its entire pattern. Of course, none of the audience is a rich man or a VIP, nor is there a fashionable lady or young master. Naming it the people's stage is also just right.</p>
<p>Most of these stages only have three or two roles, and some only have one person, which is the solo stage.</p>
<p>A beautiful "king" or "official" crown made of red and green paper is crookedly worn on a head covered with powder, painted with ink, and with messy hair. He is also draped in a dirty and unbearable broken opera costume, pacing slowly, with "dang, dang, dang, dang, Zong" in his mouth. Another person leisurely pulls the erhu, and the curtain of the play opens here. If he sings the play "Baochan Offering Wine" or "The Heavenly Maiden Scattering Flowers," the grotesque appearance of twisting and turning and the broken voice will really make you laugh or cry.</p>
<p>They mostly have to take on several roles by themselves, and the gong, drums, erhu, and all other instruments are also concurrently played by one mouth. They have no fixed location. Wherever they go, they perform.</p>
<p>After a play is finished, it is customary to say, "Friends, please help," "If you don't have money, please help with the applause." Three or five coins, you can give as much as you want.</p>

<p>The newly reopened New Stage has been doing plays for more than ten days, but it is still just doing "Adding Officials," and several main characters are not seen on stage. As a result, a group of backstage old staff are very busy! Looking for them everywhere; inviting them everywhere; who knew that God does not bless people, some main characters are sick... some main characters have gone to the mountains... Although they are persuaded horizontally to work diligently despite their illness, and persuaded vertically to come out of the mountains again, the persuaders are earnest, but the listeners are dismissive. As a result, the general audience is really tired of watching... Everyone discussed a solution and decided to issue a warning first...</p>
<p>"Adding Officials" has been done for many days,</p>
<p>The main character has not appeared on stage...</p>
<p>The medicine has been changed, but the soup has not,</p>
<p>Who cares that the black mountains and white waters are full of smoke?</p>
<p>In this turbulent and tense situation, there is a main character who is leisurely living his life of extreme happiness! What kind of extreme happiness is it? Listen to me sing!</p>
<p>Dictatorship,</p>
<p>Run away immediately;</p>
<p>Run to the mountains to be carefree,</p>
<p>The foreign house is built so high that it holds up the sky!</p>
<p>The affairs of the world are really unique, and coincidentally, there is also a main character in the north who is living his life of extreme happiness! What kind of extreme happiness is it? Look!</p>
<p>It's really lively in the Chen Wang Mansion,</p>
<p>Playing golf is practiced well;</p>
<p>"Drink today, get drunk today"!</p>
<p>Losing the country? "Who cares"?</p>

<p>Xiao Dao Hui Occupies Shanghai III - The Origin of Xiao Dao Hui</p>
<p>In 1851 (the first year of Xianfeng), after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army was launched from Guangdong and Guangxi, it spread to the Yangtze River basin. At the same time, Xiao Dao Hui, a branch of the Sanhehui, began to operate and occupied Xiamen. The Xiao Dao Hui worshipped Taoism and allowed smoking opium. Since their religious beliefs were different from those of the Taiping Army, they were despised by the Taiping Army.</p>
<p>On September 7th of the third year of Xianfeng, a part of the Xiao Dao Hui sneaked into Shanghai and soon occupied Shanghai City. That day happened to be the day of the autumn sacrifice to the Confucius Temple. The city gates were wide open, and 600 members of the Xiao Dao Hui followed the crowd into the city and attacked various government offices. Magistrate Yuan Zude was killed, and Wu Jianzhang, the governor of Songhu Tai, was trapped in his private residence. At that time, the insiders in the city threw red cloth on the streets. The members of the Xiao Dao Hui took the red cloth on their heads, so they were called "red heads." The leader of the Xiao Dao Hui was Liu Lichuan, a native of Guangdong, who was originally a sugar merchant. He had organized the Sanhehui in Shanghai a few years ago. Liu Lichuan was addicted to opium, but he was quite capable and decisive. His subordinate, Chen Alin, had some talent and directed the operations in the middle. He was actually the leader of the Xiao Dao Hui. The Xiao Dao Hui's purpose of overthrowing the Manchu government and calling on the people was originally no different from the Taiping Army's doctrine of revitalizing the Han and destroying the Manchus. The official books of the time called this rebellion the rebellion of the Min-Guang Hui bandits, but the general public called it the rebellion of Xiaojinzhu, because Xiaojinzhu was Liu Lichuan's nickname.</p>
<p>After the city fell, the Xiao Dao Hui had internal strife and divided into the Guangdong gang and the Fujian gang. The Guangdong gang accused the Fujian gang of looting too much, and the order became chaotic.</p>
<p>At that time, Wu Jianzhang, the governor of Songhu Tai, was still trapped in his private residence. Two foreigners, one Dr. Hale and one Mr. Smith, sneaked into the city from the concession, went to Wu Jianzhang's private residence, disguised him, and escaped from the city at night. First, they went to the home of missionary Dr. Anmata, because the doctor's house was near the city wall, and then moved to Qichang Foreign Company. Wu Jianzhang was thus spared.</p>
