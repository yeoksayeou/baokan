<h3>時評</h3>
<h3>日井上前藏相突遭暗殺感言彬</h3>
<p>日本往那裏去</p>
<p>爲着想打破其嚴重而且深刻的不景氣。并延續挽救其已陷於沒落悲境的命運。日本的財閥及其爪牙丨丨軍閥。决然更加緊其對於弱小民族之掠奪。採取强硬的砲艦政策。由緩和的經濟侵略。進而爲直接的武力壓迫。這是去年九一八東北事件以至此次上海禍變爆發之主因。亦即日本的財閥與軍閥的唯一企圖。</p>
<p>去年九一八日本突然暴力發動。强佔瀋陽。東北二十餘萬大軍。在張學良不抵抗命令之下。望風引退。使東北半壁河山。不崇朝而盡變顏色。這種事實。不僅使日本的財閥軍閥們拍掌歡呼慶幸其目的之達到。抑更趾高氣揚。得意忘形。視中國如無人之境。所以這次敢於大膽的又在上海揭開戰幕。其始料何嘗不如鹽澤向領團誇大的言。「四小時内可將上海華軍全部肅淸。」然而自上月二十八至現在。日每戰必敗北。以我軍英勇抗戰。其志終不得逞。這不僅日本的財閥軍閥意料所不及。應亦爲世界各國人士所認爲不可解之奇蹟。</p>
<p>這是日本財閥軍閥們的一個當頭敎訓這敎訓。不僅是暴露了日本的軍隊無作戰經騐。氣餒無鬥志。與此次日本師出無名。以及中華民族尚未容世界藐視。尚足以反抗强暴。其尤重要者。爲顯示其對華積極侵略之絕對不能打破不景氣。反足以增加其不景氣之深刻。并增重其沒落的危機。據前日本報載鹽澤談話說。「這次戰事是中國應受的敎訓。」究竟是誰應受的敎訓呢。</p>
<p>因爲對華積極侵略自去年九月十八以來日本對華貿易很顯然的一落千丈。至最近上海禍變發生。更陷於全部停頓。這種現象不僅是日本財閥軍閥們的一個鉅大創傷簡直是一下致命的打擊。其結果將使日本產業界更加凋零。失業的羣衆更加激增金融界更加速其動搖。換　之。即其崩潰之命運更日益迫近眉睫。</p>
<p>日本財閥軍閥們出兵的口實。爲「保僑」爲「制止中國的反日運動。」然而出兵的結果怎樣呢日前日本大批婦孺自上海返國時的凄凉與悲慘的景象。該足以說明「保僑」的結果了罷。幾月來我國反日運動之日益普遍與擴大。該足以說明「制止反日運動」的結果了罷。而且因爲動員大軍。軍費激增。更使預算呈露鉅大之破綻。因爲鉅額士兵之犧牲。更使人民厭惡政府之窮兵黷武。而加重其政治上之危機。今日電訊。前任藏相井上氏突遭暗殺。這顯然的爲經濟問題之故。軍閥與財閥之勾結。將自此破裂了。又據近日消息。日東京帝國與慶應兩大學敎授學生及市民。作廣大的示威運動。其口號爲「反對日帝國主義進攻支那。」神户工人及兵士遊行示威。大阪海員罷工。其口號爲「不到支那去。」「不打中國的兄弟。」「反對日帝國主義者進攻支那。」這口號不是已顯示了東亞霸王的日本。已在急劇的動蕩變化中。其轉變的前途。不可以隱若望見了嗎。</p>
<p>對華積極政策。將能收得什麽效力呢。日本的財閥軍閥們。此時應該深悔當初一念之差。致鑄成今日九洲之大錯了罷日本將走向何處去呢。日本的財閥軍閥們。又將走向何處去呢。</p>
<p>上海事件</p>
<h3>我軍擊退偷渡敵軍</h3>
<p>敵已知難暫退似待補充再攻　　敵軍飛機擊落及自墮共五架</p>
<h3>蕰藻浜戰况</h3>
<p>敵軍上午偷渡失敗</p>
<p>積極佈置圖再大舉</p>
<p>昨日（九日）吳淞方面戰事、日兵自經二次進攻失敗後、已無餘勇、故除於晨間曾一度由糧米棧進襲、爲我軍擊退後、轉入沉悶、同時張華浜糧米棧内之日兵、被我軍由蕰藻浜南進攻、有包抄之勢、故於下午三時許、在陸家觀音堂軍工路滬江大學附近一帶、堆置防禦物度掘築戰壕、似因連日進攻失敗、又將改變其所謂戰略矣、茲將昨日情形、分誌於次、</p>
<h3>日軍偷渡失敗</h3>
<p>日兵傾全力</p>
<p>進攻吳淞、先後連敗二次後、昨晨五時許、又圖偷渡蕰藻浜、冀登吳淞鎭河岸、當時日兵除由後方增援軍工路外、又用小輪拖帶駁船一艘、載有陸軍二百餘名、沿浦江在張華浜碼頭登岸、向蕰藻浜站我軍陣地猛攻、日艦及糧米棧内日兵、同時用砲向我軍後方及砲台轟擊、我砲台連續還擊、同時沿蕰藻浜南岸之我軍、奮勇挺進、在我砲彈掩護之下、向張華浜糧米棧進攻、敵軍不支旋即潰退、當時日兵正在偷渡、因受我方砲火壓迫、落浦而死者二三十名、傷亡者五十餘人、餘均敗退、至糧米棧、刻下該棧内日兵、已幾在我軍包圍中、吳淞鎭已成焦土、砲台上我軍、當敵軍由軍艦偷渡、以大砲掩護登岸時、無不奮勇作戰、甚有手足被折、仍不願退休、繼續發砲者、我軍之忠勇、可見一斑、</p>
<h3>退軍工路佈置</h3>
<p>日兵自昨晨　　偷渡又吿失敗後、彼似知圖襲我軍防綫、已無希望、且旬日來損失實力不貲、乃於昨日下午三時許、將鐵甲車十八輛·卡車八十餘輛·全部向陸家觀音堂軍工路退却、在滬江大學附近一帶、重堆防禦物、並掘築戰壕、似防我軍追擊、而有待援之勢、故自下午起、未有戰事、惟雙方砲轟、繼續不斷、</p>
<h3>日飛機擲炸彈</h3>
<p>昨晨吳淞激戰時、敵方於早晨七時許、派飛機八九架、在天空偵察吾方軍情、至八時許、該機等飛至張華浜空中、紛紛擲彈威脅、企圖擾亂我軍後方、同時駐在張華浜南之日軍、乘機開砲轟擊、甚爲激烈、但我方竭力抵禦、敵不得逞、其後日機漸漸飛散逸去、中有數架、轉飛至閘北方面、抛擲炸彈、</p>
<h3>瀏河墮落敵機</h3>
<p>昨據瀏河無線電報吿、昨日上午、有敵軍飛機一架、因機器損壞、墮落於離瀏河七里之處、内有日人三名、有兩人當時斃命、另一人受重傷、又據國民社云、據由蕰藻浜軍工路逃來之友人云、昨日上午十一時半、有日人駕駛戰鬥機、在軍工路公大紗廠屋面盤旋、一時不愼、觸撞該廠六弄一二兩號屋頂、頃刻飛機墮落、炸彈暴裂、響聲震天、濃烟四起、駕駛機師二人斃命、並傷我國兩工人、一傷頭部一傷右臂、然無要害</p>
<h3>戰地考察情形</h3>
<p>敵軍出全力進攻吳淞、我軍憑蕰藻浜及泗塘河之天險、堅守抵抗、雙方激戰二日、敵頗多死傷、卒無絲毫進展、記者爲明瞭雙方、於前日下午三時以後之戰况起見、因於昨日上午八時、冒險由楊橋浦出發、經黃興路步行至江灣、復循淞滬鐵路東行、沿途見逃難者頗多、扶老携幼、狀極可憐、九時半許、至胡家莊、該處係在吳淞張華浜之西距火綫已近、並未聞有槍砲聲、後詢之方自戰地逃出之公安局七區一所、張華浜派出所警士、（該所在軍工路七號現爲敵軍佔據）得悉、敵軍於前日下午四時許、派大隊敵兵、進攻永安紗廠西南之黃泥塘、但結果仍不利、下午七時許、沿南泗塘河之黑橋侯家浜徐家灣趙家浜寗家宅等地之敵、復向我軍猛攻、但結果仍被我軍擊退、是役我軍曾有保衛團亦加入作戰、並因防地甚爲空虚、故由江灣方面調大隊生力軍、至該方面增援、雙方激戰、至前晚九時許、全線即行休戰、前晚並無戰事、昨晨七時許、雖蕰藻浜方面復起槍砲聲、但係前綫哨兵接觸、不久即行寂然、又據張華浜方面逃出之難民稱、蕰藻浜車站後面之楊家宅、已完全毁於砲火、張華浜車站鐵路第六小學、及附近民房、均日兵佔住該處、未及逃出之鄕民男女、前日均被日兵拉去、搬運軍用物品、女子則强迫替敵軍煑飯、現蕰藻浜車站、仍在我軍之手、</p>
<h3>日兵入東華廠</h3>
<p>據確報、昨日下午三時許、有日兵一千數百人、在引翔港上岸、駐紮東華紗廠内、</p>
<h3>日軍圖再進攻</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、</p>
<p>今晨（九日）日飛機軍艦仍繼續轟擊吳淞砲台蕰藻浜寳山等處、海陸軍兵士則從事作第二次總攻勢之準備、日兵屢圖在蕰藻浜上駕浮橋、但因蕰藻浜鎭華兵之機關槍彈、密如雨下、終難成功、加以潮水盛漲、河身闊約三四百呎、故更不易着手、據外人估計、八日之一役、日軍進攻者、共有陸軍四千名海軍六千名云、今日之沉寂、實爲大風雨前之恬靜、日軍現正從事運野戰砲隊前赴前線、並在昨日戰地附近開掘戰壕、安置機關槍、楊樹浦區新築之飛機場飛機、亦見增多、共有炸機與追逐機十六架、</p>
<h3>我司令部報捷</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司、</p>
<p>令部、昨分發報捷電致各報館云、各報館均鑒、四日戌電計達、連日敵陸戰隊及陸軍、陸續增援、均被我軍擊退、吳淞要塞　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　工　　攻、　戰　　　、　不得　閘北方　、連日敵以猛烈　火掩護、迭次向我猛　、亦經擊退、五日空軍接觸擊　敵機三架敵現似有待援反攻之企圖、　　、淞滬警備司令部參謀處叩、佳申印、</p>
<h3>閘北之戰况</h3>
<p>敵飛機亂擲炸彈</p>
<p>被我軍擊落兩架</p>
<p>閘北方面、昨日上下午、均無激烈戰事、僅於上午十時許、敵軍飛機飛來投擲炸彈時、敵軍在江灣路方面、不時以大砲協助飛機轟擊、以致八字橋及天通菴路等處起火、我軍除沉着固守防線外、同時並用高射砲擊敵軍飛機、當被擊落一架、隨後敵機又飛往眞茹擲彈、亦被我軍擊落一架、敵機被我擊退後、敵軍雖不時以大砲及機槍向我陣地射擊、但不甚激烈、同時亦因我軍防守甚密、未敢向我衝鋒、惟至晚間九時後、敵軍又用大砲頻頻攻擊、故砲聲甚密、但我軍仍不爲動、茲將昨日情形紀述如下、</p>
<h3>敵機又毁二架</h3>
<p>昨日上午、敵軍飛機六架、飛至閘北眞茹一帶投擲炸彈、意圖毁壞我軍陣綫、當被我軍射擊、結果又擊落日機兩架、一架於上午十時零五分、在閘北光復路墮落、機師三人、均已斃命、並有手槍兩支、當經該處駐軍携歸、呈報司令部、另一架於上午十時二十分、在眞茹擊落、又據另一報吿、在北站旱橋附近、有一敵機因機器損傷、自動落下、機中二日人已死、</p>

<h3>前晚虹口激戰</h3>
<p>日報每日新聞云、中國神出鬼沒之便衣隊、於八日晚七時、由大砲之掩護、竟衝破我軍（日軍）嚴重之警戒防線、潛入虹口一帶、未幾、綿亙於北四川路一帶、猛烈襲擊、與我軍）日軍（僅差二百米突、用迫擊砲以必死</p>
<p>的向我方（日軍）挑戰、北四川路吳淞路老靶子路轉角、彈如雨下云、</p>
<h3>虹鎭居民恐慌</h3>
<p>自七日以來、日軍盡力進攻、戰線亦移至八字橋蕰草浜一帶、致八日十二時三十分起、僻處滬東之虹鎭育才路·飛虹路·各地、亦砲彈紛落、擊傷江北小孩四人、下午二時後、日兵又在育才臨平物華三路路口搜查行人、至六時始止、岳州路底華租交界處、亦有日兵搜查、且有兵車梭巡、迨公安局五區四分所被佔、其美路亦爲日兵侵駐、虹鎭遂處於四面包圍之中、食料大感困難昨日上午十時、虹鎭菜市、突受砲彈斃成衣匠一、居民恐慌萬狀、紛紛逃避、現劉存該處、僅佔居民十之二三、均爲貧苦之輩云、</p>
<h3>德軍事家評論</h3>
<p>昨有德國軍事專家多人、親赴前線視察、對於華軍之戰略、甚爲讚美、據云外間每稱華軍體力甚弱、實際乃不然、曾以望遠鏡瞭望、親見一華人、能與數日兵肉搏、而其結果、日兵輙不敵、又華人發彈甚經濟、彈無虚發、日兵則不然、恃其軍火之充足、濫發子彈、並無準的、華軍極富於作戰能力、可作長時間之困鬭、自歐戰迄今、未見有如是能戰之軍隊、該德軍事家等又謂、日軍槍械甚利、最適宜於示威、或虚張聲勢之用、惟作戰時、殊不見高明、其步槍機關槍之使用、不及華軍純熟、擲手溜彈更不及華軍、</p>
<h3>昨晚最後消息</h3>
<p>昨晚十一時許、閘北方面、無甚接觸、日兵仍肆故技、用砲向我轟擊、我軍仍在各原砲位還砲、互轟約一小時、至十二時許始患、間有一二槍聲、係雙方步哨所發、吳淞方面日艦、及糧米棧内登岸日兵、亦曾發砲、向我砲台射擊、經我還擊、日兵知我方有備、　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　未　即</p>

<h3>淞口戰雲中之航訊</h3>
<p>吳淞關員逃滬昨日上午、　　日軍續圖進攻吳淞江海關辦事處、及河泊司西人與瞭望臺視察進口船職工等、均因砲火猛烈、生命危險、不能再留服務、遂於昨晚全體退出乘小輪於當晚九時到滬、已向江海關報吿矣、有在海關司電話之某君、一家七口爲日兵慘殺、六人祗留一人、由日司令部逃出、昨晨至海關據其所言、被難經過、非常悲慘、</p>
<h3>日艦强查英輪</h3>
<p>昨日英商太古公司北洋班輪順天號、由滬開赴烟臺、在兩軍休戰時、駛離吳淞、詎方出淞口、即有日本軍艦一艘、上前禁阻、强迫停抛船主西人漢德、一再向日軍交涉、亦無效果、將全船旅客等嚴加搜查、查畢後、方始放行、現時英輪出口、聞將用軍艦翊護矣、</p>
<h3>商輪冒險進口</h3>
<p>昨日三北公司醒獅輪·太古公司大通輪·蕪湖輪·等、均由長江來滬、因吳淞戰事、無法進口、直至昨日午刻、兩軍休戰之際、方始冒險開進浦江、據各輪船員言、在經過吳淞時砲聲雖漸止、但因吳淞鎭民房失火、江面上白烟繚繞、幾被瀰滿天空、其慘狀實所罕見、</p>
<h3>難民出境漸少</h3>
<p>戰事發生以後、上海難民之逃往各地者、最多爲寗波、據各輪局估計、此十日内、乘輪逃往寗波之難民、足有三四十萬人、逃往蘇州及乘長江輪赴鎭江等地者、約有六七萬人、而乘車到杭州嘉興轉往内地者亦有近二十萬人、平均每人旅費以至少之五元計、則用於逃難者、亦達三四百萬元、近日逃難之人、不如前數日之擁擠、昨日寗波輪因吳淞尚有戰爭、均未開出、擬改本日離滬、旅客上船、守待出口者、已有多艘矣、</p>
<h3>廣福平安返滬</h3>
<p>寗波旅滬同鄕會、租用援載甬籍難民之廣福輪船、於日前出口時、適値吳淞有警、紛紛謠傳該輪有被日艦扣留之說、茲悉該輪、已於昨日午間、、平安返滬、而甬同鄕會、以回籍同鄕、業已疏通、滬甬航輪、又相繼復航、已向該輪公司退租、聞該輪昨日已自行開航云</p>
<h3>友邦艦兵陸續到滬</h3>
<p>美國運輸艦黑鷹號、奉令由小吕宋裝運大批軍火飛機及兵士給養品等、開來上海、已於昨日午刻進口、當即駛入浦江、停在美艦河筒以便搬運上陸分發美國駐滬各軍應用、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社九日上海通訊、法國裝甲巡洋艦華爾德盧梭號、由越南海防、載來步兵一營、將於明天到滬、又法國駐天津之步兵一營、、將於二三日間抵滬</p>
<h3>虹口視察記</h3>
<p>國民社記者於昨午六時赴虹口一帶視察、見外白渡橋已無日兵、人車通行無阻、橋北天潼路口日本電信局門前、置鐵絲網、有日兵及便衣隊駐守、交通斷絕、七路電車及十路公共汽車均繞道外虹橋行駛、乃折入百老匯路、見華印捕已照常上差、外虹橋設置機關槍一架、亦有日兵防駐、橋堍外商耶杉船廠門前、堆有沙袋、由美兵二人駐守、再北至華記路兆豐路折入東西華德路塘山路新記浜路東有恒路一帶、沿途均有中西捕巡邏、秩序尚佳、哈爾濱捕房及虹口捕房、仍爲日兵佔據、其警務員及華捕暫借莊源大長春茶樓辦事、沿河之裏虹橋電燈橋四卡子橋西嘉興橋東嘉興橋歐嘉路橋、均由日兵堆積沙袋滿佈刺網往來梭巡、遇華人即施檢查、但人踪殊鮮、至沈家灣虬江路一帶、以交通阻斷、遂折向北至梧州路小菜塲旁及岳州路底之工部局工務處門前、均由萬國商團義勇隊駐守總觀自中虹橋以北各路情形尚安寗、惟居民尚在遷避、商店閉門、景象殊蕭條也</p>
<h3>市商會再函工部局即日接防虹口區警權</h3>
<p>市商會昨致工部局函云、逕啓者、此次日兵在閘北挑釁、激成戰事、華租兩界均受其害、工商輟業、敝會刻正决議、勸吿本市工商、在安全區域以内者、先行一律開市開廠、期以安定人心、减少失業、漸復舊觀、惟查虹口區域自戰事起後、全歸日軍防守、故該區内居民所受兵禍、至爲慘酷、近雖由貴局議將該颧域内警備權逐漸收回、然其所議辦法、仍以華印各捕與日軍日便衣隊混合巡邏、則華印各捕、在日軍控制之下、斷難自由行使職權、而商店已成爲驚弓之鳥、亦决難再事營業、此與敝會力勸開市恢復秩序之本旨、適得其反、查日本藉口不將虹口警備權完全讓還貴局、無非謂捕房力量微弱、不足維持該區域内治安、現在英美兩國軍隊、陸續到達、兵力增厚、足以充分在租界内劃區防守、輔助華印各捕之力所不及、經敝會執監聯席會議議决函請貴局、早日設法、將虹口一帶日人警備區域内之强暴日軍撤退、俾復營業而空人心在案、相應錄案函達、即請貴局查照迅予辦理、見復爲荷、</p>
<h3>市公安局之調查</h3>
<p>本市公安局昨以吳淞七區區長趙澤周突吿失踪不、知下落特派員至淞調查眞相、惟據所派之員回滬報吿、以七區公安局正爲戰區、未能前往、祗得就近調查、知七區趙區長諒已出走、警署亦無恙、至七區一分所係在蕰藻浜、故該所現已由所長曾可光率領全體警士退出戰區云、</p>
<p>引翔港公安局五區四分所、一時被日軍强佔旋即仍爲我軍奪回、盤踞警所之日便衣隊與陸戰隊約三十餘名均分頭竄去、查該地本非兵家必爭地點、但旣爲敵佔勢須擊走之云、</p>
<h3>商務印書館停業經過</h3>
<p>全廠被燬損失重大</p>
<p>總經協理等均停職</p>
<p>商務印書館、此次被日機抛彈炸燬、宣吿停業、該館爲吾國唯一之文化敎育機關、驟遭國難極爲社會所注意、據該館負責者云、該館總廠及東方圖書館、向設閘北寳山路、爲公司全部精華及大部份資產所在地、此次被日機炸燬一空、損失之距、匪言可罄、且東方圖書館所藏善本、及本國各地方志全套、亦同歸於盡、尤非金錢所能計其損失、公司當總廠被炸之後、因念同人生活艱難、隨即每人發給銀洋十元、嗣董事會因總廠全燬、資產損失殆盡、財力旣無法維持、職工亦無法工作、經多次之討論、不得已議决、將上海總館全部停業、所有職工全體停職、每人並再另發半個月薪工、此項辦法公司實已於萬分困難之中、特爲全體同人盡相當補助之意至於公司本身善後問題、因廠中餘燼、整理需時、非短時期内所能結束、祗得俟大局粗定、靜候股東會解决、總經協理、現亦一律停職目前由董事會組織特别委員會、處理善後事宜云、</p>
<h3>蘇州河兩岸滿佈鐵絲網</h3>
<p>難民不能任意登陸</p>
<p>僅老垃圾橋間開放</p>
<p>閘北居民、除赤貪者由慈善團體救護脫險外、餘則陸續自行奔避、其欲逃往租界者、因各處交通阻隔、祇得藉一葉小舟循蘇州河由西而東、於各碼頭登岸、近日公共租界軍事當局鑒於形勢之嚴重、業將蘇州河兩岸滿佈鐵絲網、老垃圾橋南端、且堆疊沙袋、逃難者遂不能任意登陸、所幸猶網開一面、將老垃圾橋與老閘橋中間之碼頭開放、於是凡從蘇州河西面載運難民之船只、槪在該處停泊、每一舟到、男女老幼、爭先恐後紛紛登陸、捕房則特派巡捕數名、終日在其地妥予照料、是故人雖擁擠、而秩序尚不紊亂</p>

<p>一月二十四日日本海軍援兵開抵吳淞口外、同時風傳閘北中國軍隊亦已增援、是日日本總領事通知上海市長、謂渠若不於相當時期之内接到答復、或答復不能滿意、則日本政府保留依照情形採取必要行動之權、爾時上海市長業向中立各國代表聲明、準備作最大讓步、藉以避免衝突、並努力勸吿當地各界領袖、俾其取銷抗日抵貨會、又以「抗日」二字被日人認爲侮辱日本國家、即對於其他團體名稱、有用「抗日」字樣者亦擬予以删去、結果抗日抵貨會被封、其辦事處皆於一月二十七至二十八日夜間由中國警察一一封鎖、</p>

<p>領所組成、外加工部局之總董、　捕房之總巡、商團之司令、以防守司令中最　者爲主席、此人於各國防軍各防地段應如何詳細辦理、並無以爲有指示之權　分派地段、聯絡辦理佈置防守之大計而已、英美兩軍於宣布戒嚴之後、即各開往所駐地點、意大利軍隊於廿九日開到防地、日軍之一段、爲租界東北全境、西以北河南路爲界、從防守委員會之眼光觀之、亦包括租界以外一段地方、西以北江西路及吳淞鐵路爲界、北以虹口公園之北面爲界、其東則連成一綫、大部分爲虹口公園之東北角、連至哈爾濱巡捕房、日人住在虹口公園一帶者不少、該園與北四川路狄思威路雖在租界之外、却是租界之產業、平時由工部局派捕巡守、中國當局於夜間十一點發生事件以前、似乎於界外日軍一段之事、未接到關照、初行戒嚴之時、日軍亦未駐防至界外之一段、然須智本水兵往時常在工部局路上以上地段駐兵防守、以保護其僑民、而其海軍司令部亦設於該段之盡端、</p>
<p>是晚十一時、日本海軍司令發布吿兩道並將副本送致上海市長、市長謂於十一點廿五分方接得之、布吿之一、提及戒嚴、並謂日本海軍對於閘北情形極覺憂慮、該處日僑衆多、已决定派兵到該段、以行其法律與秩序、因此、望中國當局從速將駐在閘北之兵、退往鐵路以西、撤除該地之佈防、其别一布吿、謂派與日兵保護租界秩序之一段、凡須實行戒嚴上之事務者、將皆履行之等語、日本水兵以及武裝平民、先已在海軍陸戰隊司令部召集者、沿北四川路而進、西趨靶子路、直到北河南路、沿途在弄口分派隊伍、至中夜、信號一發、所派隊伍、即向西北趨進、鐵路方面最後一隊、約有水兵一百、開一裝甲汽車、欲在北河南路之底分界處、越過大門、爲上海商團所阻、因門在該團所守之處、此門可通鐵路、中國軍隊初未從日海軍司令退兵之要求、且即令决定自退、亦不能於其短時期内、將該段中國軍隊實行撤退、以前數日所釀成之時局、亦須顧及、蓋將使中國當局、目日本海軍當局所行之辦法爲其較大之軍事舉動之一部分、日本水兵嗣遇中國正式軍隊之抵抗、、日本軍隊開至鐵路綫南之寳山路、但未能更至該處之南</p>
<p>其路線在鐵路之東、迤北河南路北四川路之邊界、日軍爲中國裝貨火車所創、該火車乃以車站出發、巡行於吳淞鐵路上、後避於東棧内、該路爲中國軍隊防守堅固、因此日軍於一月二十九日、在車站放炸彈、用飛機毁壞火車路、寳山路其他房屋、亦被放火、用發火之炸彈燒之、大槪信爲故意爲之、以滅去窺得日軍陣線之要地、死傷雖不可知、但生命損失、當頗不少、上海市長因日軍之舉動、向領事團提抗議、日本則謂此次舉動與所提要求之事無關、要求先已承認所以如此、乃爲保護所欲佔據之地之一段内之日人、日本當局又稱、所取舉動即遇中國武力抵抗、且爲日本當局自負完全責任者、乃在其所派界限之内、如屬必要之時爲租界防務計畫之所許行、二十九日之大軍、戰爭進而不息、二十九日下午、因上海市長之請、英美兩總領事設法致成暫和局面、以夜間九時爲始、此暫和之策、僅彼此同意、勿再發放槍砲而已、</p>

<p>（日内瓦）上海領事調查團向國聯會所提報吿書中有一段顧爲此間各國報界所注意并特别加以評論、其文曰、正月二十八日至二十九日之夜、日本水兵　隊約二百員名、獲有鐵甲汽車一架擬在北河南路盡頭處通過公共租界鐵門、　而往華界北火車站、但爲萬國商團隊所阻、此間各國報界處以此段報吿書對於國聯會指示之處雖甚委婉、却甚明白、其意若云、日本在正月廿八至二十九日之夜所採行動、并非完全由於公共租界宣吿緊急狀態所致、此種動作亦非可視爲共同守衛公共租界所應出云云（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）　外務省發言人今日聲稱、日本主張在中國設立不駐兵區域之提議、稍引起錯誤印象、實則此議不必修正、或代替九國公約、但可用以補充九國公約耳、此議不獨不分裂中國、且若實施之、可大减分裂之危險、此議根本主義、在打破中國軍閥之權力、而便穩固政府之成立、世人現應知中國陸軍之作用與西方諸國不同、中國陸軍在國防上爲無用、不過爲軍閥在國内政治競爭中之工具而已、美國對於日本此議有所批評、但若美國不歡迎此議、則不妨另提解决辦法、因欲恢復中國之穩固、勢不可不有所作爲也、發言人又謂日本此項計畫、不妨先試行於上海、如覺美滿、再推行於他處云（、九日路透電）</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary</h3>
<h3>Reflections on the Sudden Assassination of Former Japanese Finance Minister Inoue by Yan Bin</h3>
<p>Where is Japan Heading?</p>
<p>In an attempt to break free from its severe and profound economic recession, and to continue and rescue its already declining fate, Japan's financial cliques and their henchmen – the militarists – have resolutely intensified their plunder of weaker nations, adopting a tough gunboat policy. From gradual economic aggression, they have advanced to direct military oppression. This is the main reason for the September 18th Incident in Northeast China last year, and even for the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident this time. This is also the sole aim of Japan's financial cliques and militarists.</p>
<p>Last year, on September 18th, Japan suddenly launched a violent attack, forcibly occupying Shenyang. The 200,000-strong Northeast Army, under Zhang Xueliang's order of non-resistance, retreated at the mere sight of the enemy, causing half of Northeast China to change color almost overnight. This fact not only made Japan's financial cliques and militarists clap their hands, cheer, and rejoice at the achievement of their goal, but also made them arrogant, elated, and regard China as a land without people. Therefore, they dared to boldly open the war in Shanghai again this time. Their initial expectation was no different from the exaggerated words of Rear Admiral Shiozawa to the consular body: "The entire Chinese army in Shanghai can be completely wiped out within four hours." However, from January 28th to the present, the Japanese have been defeated in every battle. With our army's heroic resistance, their ambition has ultimately not been achieved. This is not only beyond the expectations of Japan's financial cliques and militarists, but should also be regarded as an inexplicable miracle by people of all countries in the world.</p>
<p>This is a head-on lesson for Japan's financial cliques and militarists. This lesson not only exposes the Japanese army's lack of combat experience, demoralization, and lack of fighting spirit, as well as the groundless nature of Japan's expedition this time, and the fact that the Chinese nation has not yet allowed the world to despise it, and is still capable of resisting violence, but more importantly, it shows that its active aggression against China can absolutely not break the economic recession, but can instead increase the depth of its recession, and increase the crisis of its decline. According to a previous Japanese newspaper report quoting Shiozawa, "This war is a lesson that China should receive." But who exactly should receive the lesson?</p>
<p>Because of active aggression against China, since September 18th of last year, Japan's trade with China has clearly plummeted. With the recent Shanghai Incident, it has fallen into complete stagnation. This phenomenon is not only a huge wound for Japan's financial cliques and militarists, but simply a fatal blow. The result will be that Japan's industry will become more desolate, the number of unemployed people will increase more sharply, and the financial sector will accelerate its turmoil. In other words, its fate of collapse is approaching ever closer.</p>
<p>The pretext for the Japanese financial cliques and militarists to send troops is "to protect residents" and "to stop the anti-Japanese movement in China." But what is the result of sending troops? The desolate and tragic scene of a large number of Japanese women and children returning to Japan from Shanghai a few days ago should be enough to illustrate the result of "protecting residents," right? The increasing prevalence and expansion of the anti-Japanese movement in our country in recent months should be enough to illustrate the result of "stopping the anti-Japanese movement," right? Moreover, because of the mobilization of a large army, military expenses have increased sharply, further exposing huge flaws in the budget. Because of the sacrifice of a huge number of soldiers, the people are even more disgusted with the government's warmongering, further aggravating its political crisis. Today's telegram reported that former Finance Minister Inoue was suddenly assassinated. This is clearly due to economic problems. The collusion between militarists and financial cliques will break down from this point on. According to recent news, professors, students, and citizens of Tokyo Imperial University and Keio University in Japan held large-scale demonstrations. Their slogan was "Oppose Japanese imperialism's invasion of China." Workers and soldiers in Kobe marched and demonstrated. Their slogans were "Don't go to China," "Don't fight Chinese brothers," and "Oppose Japanese imperialists' invasion of China." Haven't these slogans already shown that Japan, the overlord of East Asia, is undergoing rapid turmoil and change? Can't the future of its transformation be vaguely foreseen?</p>
<p>What effect will the active policy towards China achieve? Japan's financial cliques and militarists should deeply regret their initial mistake at this time, which led to today's great error in Kyushu, right? Where is Japan going? Where are Japan's financial cliques and militarists going?</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Our Army Repels Enemy's Sneak Attack</h3>
<p>The enemy, realizing the difficulty, temporarily retreats, seemingly waiting for reinforcements to attack again. A total of five enemy planes shot down and self-destroyed.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation at the Wenzaobang</h3>
<p>Enemy's sneak crossing attempt fails in the morning.</p>
<p>Actively deploying to attempt a larger offensive.</p>
<p>Regarding yesterday's (9th) battle on the Wusong front, the Japanese soldiers, after failing in two attacks, had no remaining courage. Therefore, except for a brief attack from the Liangmizhan (Grain and Rice Wharf) in the morning, which was repelled by our army, they turned to a stalemate. At the same time, the Japanese soldiers inside the Zhanghuabang Liangmizhan were attacked by our army advancing from the south of Wenzaobang, creating an encirclement. Therefore, at around 3 PM, they piled up defensive materials and dug trenches in the area near Lujia Guanyintang, Jungong Road, and Shanghai University. It seems that due to repeated failed attacks, they will change their so-called strategy. The situation yesterday is recorded in detail below:</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's Sneak Crossing Attempt Fails</h3>
<p>Japanese soldiers exert all their strength.</p>
<p>Attacking Wusong, after being defeated twice in succession, they attempted to sneak across the Wenzaobang again at around 5 AM yesterday, hoping to land on the riverbank of Wusong Town. At that time, in addition to reinforcements from the rear to Jungong Road, the Japanese soldiers also used a small wheel-tow barge carrying more than 200 army soldiers to land at the Zhanghuabang Wharf along the Huangpu River, launching a fierce attack on our army's position at the Wenzaobang Station. Japanese warships and Japanese soldiers inside the Liangmizhan simultaneously used artillery to bombard our army's rear and the fort. Our fort continuously returned fire. At the same time, our army along the south bank of the Wenzaobang bravely advanced, attacking the Zhanghuabang Liangmizhan under the cover of our artillery shells. The enemy army could not withstand it and immediately collapsed. At that time, the Japanese soldiers were attempting to cross, and because they were suppressed by our artillery fire, 20 to 30 people fell into the river and died, 50 to 60 were injured or killed, and the rest retreated to the Liangmizhan. Currently, the Japanese soldiers in the warehouse are almost surrounded by our army. Wusong Town has become scorched earth. Our army on the fort fought bravely when the enemy army used warships to sneak across, using artillery to cover their landing. Some even had their hands and feet broken, but were unwilling to retire and continued to fire. The loyalty and bravery of our army can be seen.</p>
<h3>Retreat to Jungong Road to Deploy</h3>
<p>After the Japanese soldiers' sneak crossing attempt failed again yesterday morning, they seemed to know that there was no hope of attacking our army's defense line, and that they had suffered considerable losses in strength in recent days. Therefore, at around 3 PM yesterday, they retreated all 18 armored vehicles and more than 80 trucks to Lujia Guanyintang Jungong Road, re-piling defensive materials and digging trenches in the area near Shanghai University, seemingly to prevent our army from pursuing and waiting for reinforcements. Therefore, there was no battle from the afternoon onwards, but the artillery bombardment on both sides continued incessantly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs</h3>
<p>During the fierce battle at Wusong yesterday morning, the enemy sent eight or nine planes at around 7 AM to scout our military situation in the sky. At around 8 AM, the planes flew to the sky above Zhanghuabang, dropping bombs to threaten us, attempting to disrupt our army's rear. At the same time, the Japanese army stationed south of Zhanghuabang took the opportunity to open fire and bombard fiercely, but our side tried our best to resist, and the enemy did not succeed. Afterwards, the Japanese planes gradually dispersed and flew away. Several of them turned and flew to the Zhabei area to drop bombs.</p>
<h3>Enemy Plane Crashes in Liuhang</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Liuhang yesterday, an enemy plane crashed at a location seven miles away from Liuhang yesterday morning due to mechanical failure. There were three Japanese people inside, two of whom died on the spot, and the other was seriously injured. According to the Guomin News Agency, a friend who escaped from Wenzaobang Jungong Road said that a Japanese pilot flying a fighter plane circled over the roof of the Gongda Textile Factory on Jungong Road at 11:30 AM yesterday. He was careless for a moment and collided with the roofs of houses No. 1 and 2 in Lane 6 of the factory. The plane crashed instantly, the bomb exploded, the sound was deafening, and thick smoke rose everywhere. The two pilots were killed, and two Chinese workers were injured, one with a head injury and the other with a right arm injury, but they were not fatal.</p>
<h3>Situation of Battlefield Investigation</h3>
<p>The enemy army launched a full-scale attack on Wusong, and our army relied on the natural defenses of the Wenzaobang and Sitang River to hold firm and resist. The two sides fought fiercely for two days, and the enemy suffered many casualties, but made no progress. In order to understand the battle situation on both sides after 3 PM the day before yesterday, the reporter ventured out from Yangqiao Pu at 8 AM yesterday, walked along Huangxing Road to Jiangwan, and then traveled east along the Songhu Railway. Along the way, many refugees were seen, supporting the old and carrying the young, in a pitiful state. At around 9:30 AM, we arrived at Hujiazhuang, which is located west of Zhanghuabang, Wusong, and is close to the firing line. We did not hear the sound of gunfire. Later, we learned from a policeman from the first station of the seventh district of the Public Security Bureau who had escaped from the battlefield (the station is currently occupied by the enemy army at No. 7 Jungong Road) that the enemy army sent a large team of enemy soldiers at around 4 PM the day before yesterday to attack Huangnitang, southwest of the Yong'an Textile Factory, but the result was still unfavorable. At around 7 PM, the enemies along the Heiqiao Houjiabang Xujiawan Zhaojiabang Ningjiazha and other places along the South Sitang River launched a fierce attack on our army, but the result was still repelled by our army. In this battle, our army also had a local defense regiment joining the battle, and because the defense area was very empty, a large team of reinforcements was transferred from Jiangwan to reinforce that area. The two sides fought fiercely until around 9 PM the night before last, and the entire line went into ceasefire. There was no battle the night before last. Although there was gunfire on the Wenzaobang side again at around 7 AM yesterday, it was a contact between frontline sentries, and it soon became quiet. According to refugees who escaped from the Zhanghuabang area, the Yangjiazhai behind the Wenzaobang Station had been completely destroyed by artillery fire. The Zhanghuabang Station Railway Sixth Elementary School and nearby civilian houses were all occupied by Japanese soldiers. The villagers, both men and women, who had not had time to escape were all dragged away by the Japanese soldiers the day before yesterday to transport military supplies, and the women were forced to cook for the enemy army. Any hesitation would result in immediate violence. Children were sacrificed under their knives, and the cries shook the fields, but the Japanese soldiers still felt it was not enough and set fire to all the civilian houses. Therefore, the cries, gunshots, artillery fire, and firelight were mixed together, and the sound and light were indistinguishable. We couldn't help but shed tears for it. Unexpectedly, disaster was about to befall us. Later, the Japanese soldiers saw that the human army's counterattack was very fierce, and that there were no reinforcements, so they retreated step by step towards Zhanghuabang. However, the Japanese soldiers at the station were still searching. We were seen where we were lying down. The Japanese soldiers immediately raised their guns and bombarded. Station Chief Ji was hit in the abdomen by a bullet, and blood gushed out. Seeing that it was difficult to endure any longer, we immediately took our families and Station Chief Ji's wife and stepped forward. At that time, Station Chief Ji was still conscious and repeatedly urged us to leave the dangerous situation quickly, saying that his life and death could be ignored, but he only asked us to collect his body after we left and send his widow to his home to comfort his heart. Because the opportunity was urgent, I had no choice but to agree with tears in my eyes. Before long, Station Chief Ji died. My family, Station Chief Ji's wife, and I, a total of seven people, were tied up by the Japanese soldiers after we came out of the cellar and taken to the Liangmizhan. In the middle, ticket seller Ye Keqing took the opportunity to escape to our army's position. The Japanese soldiers chased after him but could not catch up, so they shot and killed him. We still saw Ye Jun fall to the ground after being shot in the twilight. After we were escorted to the Liangmizhan, the Japanese soldiers began to search us, even a watch was searched and confiscated. All of our clothes were stripped off, leaving only single shirts and pants, and we were repeatedly interrogated. The Japanese soldiers wanted to put us to death several times, but they never violated the women who were also detained. Like this, one night passed. On the 8th, I negotiated with someone who looked like a military officer and ordered him to release Station Chief Ji's wife. At first, he refused. It was not until around 6 PM that a Japanese soldier passed on an order to release all seven of us. We left in a hurry. It was raining, and the road was muddy, and we stumbled at every step. Also, because we had not taken a drop of water for two days, we felt weak all over, and our feet were as heavy as a thousand catties. The women supported the old and carried the young, making it even more difficult. Because I was only wearing a single shirt, I shivered and fell more than a dozen times on the way, so I was covered in mud, and the women's feet, heels, and clothes were all soaked by rain and snow. In the dark night, we finally escaped the tiger's mouth on the (9th). The station had been destroyed by the Japanese soldiers. The station's ticket collector, Zhang Jingyin, was lost when he fled, and has not been found yet. The corpse of Station Chief Ji will probably not be collected and will be destroyed by the Japanese soldiers. While speaking, he still couldn't stop sobbing. Later, Chen Xinghan, the director of the two road bureaus, had already made arrangements for him to settle down and plan for the future, and he would try to collect the body of Station Chief Ji.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Enter Donghua Factory</h3>
<p>According to reliable reports, at around 3 PM yesterday, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers landed at Yinxiang Port and stationed in the Donghua Textile Factory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Plans to Attack Again</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported,</p>
<p>This morning (9th), Japanese planes and warships continued to bombard the Wusong Fort, Wenzaobang, Baoshan, and other places. The soldiers of the army and navy are preparing for the second general offensive. The Japanese soldiers have repeatedly tried to build pontoon bridges on the Wenzaobang, but because the machine gun bullets of the Chinese soldiers in Wenzaobang Town are as dense as rain, it is difficult to succeed. In addition, the tide is high, and the river is about 300 to 400 feet wide, making it even more difficult to start. According to foreign estimates, there were a total of 4,000 army soldiers and 6,000 navy soldiers involved in the attack on the 8th. Today's silence is actually the calm before the storm. The Japanese army is currently transporting field artillery units to the front line, and digging trenches and installing machine guns near the battlefield yesterday. The newly built airfield in the Yangshupu district has also seen an increase in aircraft, with a total of 16 bombers and pursuit planes.</p>
<h3>Our Headquarters Reports Victory</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command,</p>
<p>Yesterday, the command issued a victory telegram to various newspapers, saying, "To all newspapers, the telegram received on the 4th. The enemy's marines and army have been continuously reinforced, but have been repelled by our army. Wusong Fortress has been attacked. The attacks have been unsuccessful. In the Zhabei area, the enemy has repeatedly launched fierce attacks on us under the cover of intense fire, but has also been repelled. On the 5th, the air force engaged and shot down three enemy planes. The enemy now seems to have plans to wait for reinforcements and launch a counterattack. Signed, Staff Office of the Songhu Garrison Command. Jia Shen Printing."</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Enemy planes drop bombs indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Two shot down by our army.</p>
<p>There were no fierce battles in the Zhabei area yesterday morning and afternoon. Only at around 10 AM, when enemy planes flew in to drop bombs, the enemy army in the Jiangwan Road area constantly used artillery to assist the planes in bombing, causing fires in the Baziqiao and Tiantong'an Road areas. Our army, in addition to calmly holding its defense line, also used anti-aircraft guns to attack the enemy planes. One was shot down, and then the enemy planes flew to Zhenru to drop bombs, and another was shot down by our army. After the enemy planes were repelled by our army, the enemy army constantly fired artillery and machine guns at our positions, but it was not very intense. At the same time, because our army's defense was very tight, they did not dare to charge at us. However, after 9 PM, the enemy army frequently attacked with artillery again, so the sound of artillery was very dense, but our army remained unmoved. The situation yesterday is described below:</p>
<h3>Two More Enemy Planes Destroyed</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, six enemy planes flew to the Zhabei Zhenru area to drop bombs, intending to destroy our army's defense line. They were shot at by our army, and as a result, two more Japanese planes were shot down. One crashed at Guangfu Road, Zhabei, at 10:05 AM, and all three pilots were killed. There were also two pistols, which were taken away by the garrison troops there and reported to the headquarters. Another was shot down in Zhenru at 10:20 AM. According to another report, near the Hanqiao Bridge in the North Station, an enemy plane crashed automatically due to mechanical damage. Two Japanese people in the plane were already dead.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Hospital Bombed</h3>
<p>At 0:40 PM yesterday, an enemy plane scouted in the Tiantong'an Road area of Zhabei and dropped several bombs. One fell at the southeast corner of the Guangdong Hospital on Tiantong'an Road, creating a hole. Another fell on the roof of the hospital, immediately starting a fire. According to another report, at 7:25 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out near Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Road, and Washington Lane, burning more than a dozen bungalows. The fire brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire, and it took two hours to extinguish it. According to investigators, the fire was set by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in Hongkou the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>The Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported that Chinese guerrillas, appearing and disappearing like ghosts, broke through our army's (Japanese army's) strict alert defense line under the cover of artillery at 7 PM on the 8th and infiltrated the Hongkou area. Before long, they launched a fierce attack along North Sichuan Road, only 200 meters away from our army (Japanese army), using mortars to challenge our side (Japanese army) with a death wish. Shells rained down on the corner of North Sichuan Road, Wusong Road, and Laobazi Road.</p>
<h3>Panic Among Residents of Hongkou Town</h3>
<p>Since the 7th, the Japanese army has been doing its best to attack, and the battle line has also moved to the Baziqiao Wenzaobang area. As a result, from 12:30 PM on the 8th, artillery shells fell on Yucai Road and Feihong Road and other places in Hongkou Town, a remote area in eastern Shanghai, injuring four children in Jiangbei. After 2 PM, Japanese soldiers searched pedestrians at the intersections of Yucai, Linping, and Wuhua Roads, stopping only at 6 PM. Japanese soldiers also searched the Yuezhou Road end of the border between the Chinese and the Foreign Settlement, and there were troop carriers patrolling. As the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau was occupied, and Qimei Road was also invaded by Japanese soldiers, Hongkou Town was surrounded on all sides, and food was very difficult to obtain. At 10 AM yesterday, a tailor was killed by an artillery shell in the Hongkou vegetable market, and the residents panicked and fled. Currently, only 20 to 30 percent of the residents remain there, all of whom are poor.</p>
<h3>German Military Expert Comments</h3>
<p>Several German military experts went to the front line yesterday to inspect and greatly praised the Chinese army's strategy. They said that outsiders often say that the Chinese army's physical strength is very weak, but in fact it is not. Through telescopes, they personally saw a Chinese person engage in hand-to-hand combat with several Japanese soldiers, and the result was that the Japanese soldiers were always defeated. Also, the Chinese people are very economical in firing bullets, and every bullet hits its target. The Japanese soldiers are not like that. Relying on the abundance of their ammunition, they fire bullets indiscriminately and without any accuracy. The Chinese army is very capable of fighting and can fight for a long time. Since the European War, they have not seen such a capable army. The German military experts also said that Japanese guns and weapons are very sharp and are most suitable for demonstrations or for making a false show of strength. However, they are not very clever in combat. Their use of rifles and machine guns is not as skilled as that of the Chinese army, and they are even less skilled in throwing hand grenades than the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Last Night's Latest News</h3>
<p>At around 11 PM last night, there was not much contact in the Zhabei area. The Japanese soldiers were still playing their old tricks, using artillery to bombard us. Our army was still returning fire from its original artillery positions, and the mutual bombardment lasted for about an hour, until around 12 o'clock. There were occasional gunshots, which were fired by the sentries on both sides. The Japanese warships in the Wusong area and the Japanese soldiers who landed in the Liangmizhan also fired artillery and shot at our fort. After we returned fire, the Japanese soldiers knew that we were prepared, and they did not dare to act rashly.</p>
<h3>Nanshi is Heavily Guarded</h3>
<p>The Japanese plainclothes team was repelled in Rihui the night before last.</p>
<p>At 8:25 PM on the day before yesterday (8th), a Japanese plainclothes team of more than 30 people used a small steamer to tow to the vicinity of Rihui, intending to land and disturb Nanshi. They were discovered by our garrison navy marines, who shouted an order but received no response. Our side opened fire and swept the area, and the plainclothes team returned fire with several volleys, but their momentum gradually weakened, so they turned the rudder and fled. According to the Navy Headquarters, the area along the river in Gaochang Temple is under stricter guard than usual. (Pacific News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Massacre Chinese in the Wenzaobang Area</h3>
<p>Qu Hesun Talks About the Tragic Situation at the Time</p>
<p>Station Chief Ji Youqing and others were killed.</p>
<p>Many villagers in the area were killed.</p>
<p>When the Japanese soldiers launched a large-scale attack on the Wusong Fort Taiwan from both land and water routes on the afternoon of the 7th, the Songhu Road Wenzaobang and Zhanghuabang stations became the focus of the battle because Jungong Road was on their left and right, and they were also located near the port. Ji Youqing, the station chief of Wenzaobang Station, and Ye Keqing, the ticket seller, were shot and killed by Japanese soldiers for defending the station to the death. Ticket collector Zhang Jingyin went missing and has not been found yet. Qu Hesun, the day shift station chief, went through thousands of hardships before escaping from the tiger's den, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon after a night of running around. He described the Japanese soldiers' attack on Wenzaobang and various cruel acts in great detail. Here is what Qu said: I (hereinafter similar) am the station chief of Wenzaobang Station and work with Station Chief Ji Youqing. When the Japanese soldiers invaded Zhabei on January 28th, the Songhu Line passenger train was stopped, but even though we had no official business and the situation was dangerous, as the station chief, we should have stayed at the station to maintain the station before we were allowed to leave by our superiors. Therefore, we never left the station. Later, the Japanese soldiers opened fire on our fort, and although stray bullets reached the station, we did not pay attention to it. Unexpectedly, at around 1 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, we suddenly learned that Japanese soldiers had been transported to Zhanghuabang Station, and at the same time, there were also news of Japanese soldiers landing at the Liangmizhan to the east of the station. Before long, we saw a large number of Japanese soldiers gathering from the Liangmizhan and Jungong Road, crossing the railway and heading towards Wenzaobang Station. At the same time, Japanese warships opened fire on our fort, and our fort also returned fire. The bridge between Wenzaobang and Wusong Town was blown up. Under the threat of artillery fire, we hurriedly ran to the low-lying area of the station to take shelter. When the Japanese soldiers saw that the bridge had been broken, they first occupied the station, and then attacked our army's position on the Heiqiao Bridge on the South Sitang River. Before long, they were defeated and fled to Xujiawan Houjiabridge Ningjiazhai to attack, but they were defeated by our army again. Our army immediately launched a general attack, and the fort also used artillery to assist in the battle. As a result, Wenzaobang Station became the focus of the artillery fire on both sides. When the Japanese soldiers occupied the station and launched a sneak attack on Heiqiao, the residents in the villages along the way were driven out by the Japanese soldiers. Those who were well-dressed were shot, or stabbed all over their bodies with bayonets, or detained in the Liangmizhan and forced to work. The women were teased at will and ordered to cook for them. Any hesitation would result in immediate violence. Children were sacrificed under their knives, and the cries shook the fields, but the Japanese soldiers still felt it was not enough and set fire to all the civilian houses. Therefore, the cries, gunshots, artillery fire, and firelight were mixed together, and the sound and light were indistinguishable. We couldn't help but shed tears for it. Unexpectedly, disaster was about to befall us. Later, the Japanese soldiers saw that the human army's counterattack was very fierce, and that there were no reinforcements, so they retreated step by step towards Zhanghuabang. However, the Japanese soldiers at the station were still searching. We were seen where we were lying down. The Japanese soldiers immediately raised their guns and bombarded. Station Chief Ji was hit in the abdomen by a bullet, and blood gushed out. Seeing that it was difficult to endure any longer, we immediately took our families and Station Chief Ji's wife and stepped forward. At that time, Station Chief Ji was still conscious and repeatedly urged us to leave the dangerous situation quickly, saying that his life and death could be ignored, but he only asked us to collect his body after we left and send his widow to his home to comfort his heart.

<h3>Various Public Organizations Telegraph Appeals to Various Nations to Uphold Justice</h3>
<p>Swiftly Adopt Effective Measures</p>
<p>To Safeguard World Peace</p>
<p>The various public organizations of Shanghai telegraphed the governments of Great Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and the Council of the League of Nations, stating: This time, Japan has launched an undeclared war against China, completely disregarding the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. It suddenly occupied Manchuria, treating world opinion as nothing. Not satisfied with this, it further resorts to violence against Shanghai, actively carrying out its aggression, disregarding the resolutions passed by the League of Nations. Regarding the four demands made by the Japanese Consul in Shanghai, the Mayor of Shanghai had fully accepted them by the afternoon of January 28th, and the Consul had expressed satisfaction. However, at 11:25 p.m. that night, the Japanese Naval Commander in Shanghai suddenly notified the Chinese authorities, demanding the withdrawal of troops stationed in Zhabei. Within 35 minutes, he mobilized troops to occupy Chinese territory. The Chinese troops, for self-defense, had no choice but to exert all their efforts to resist the Japanese naval and marine corps and all their armed personnel. When the Japanese military plan failed, they continued to deploy reinforcements, landing from the International Settlement, and using the Settlement as a base for attacking Chinese troops. For days, they have been using aircraft to drop bombs, burn houses, and incite Japanese residents to brutally kill unarmed Chinese citizens, women, and children, committing all kinds of inhuman acts. Such aerial attacks are beyond description in their wickedness. Sir Cecil has described them as the most barbaric methods of warfare. The result is nothing but the destruction of prosperous urban areas, with the lives and property of citizens sacrificed, tens of thousands of non-combatant innocent people made homeless, and Shanghai's entire industry and commerce brought to a standstill. The economic structure jointly built over the past eighty years has been plunged into a state of terror. Japan's actions clearly aim to expand the severity of the situation. On the one hand, it seeks to intimidate the Chinese in Shanghai and other places such as Manchuria, Tianjin, Qingdao, Fuzhou, and Shantou, causing them to suffer the same panic, making it easier to subdue China. On the other hand, it aims to gain a superior position in northern and central China, overwhelming other major powers. The recent Shanghai incident originated from Japan's occupation of Manchuria. Therefore, if Shanghai is regarded as a local issue and an attempt is made to resolve it separately without addressing the overall issue arising from the occupation of Manchuria, all efforts will inevitably fail. As a result, Japan will inevitably become even more unscrupulous and continue to carry out similar atrocities in other parts of China. It should be noted that Japan's occupation of Manchuria coincided with the holding of the League of Nations General Assembly. Its attack on Heilongjiang Province, reaching Qiqihar, occurred when the League of Nations passed its second resolution. Its plan to occupy Jinzhou (the last administrative organ of China in Manchuria) also coincided with the League of Nations passing its third resolution on the case. Now, the violence in Shanghai is also happening after the League of Nations dispatched an investigation team. Japan's disregard for world opinion and contempt for the League of Nations are evident. The Chinese government and people have consistently expressed their trust in the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, hoping that they will ultimately resolve international disputes. Now that Japan has repeatedly invaded and violated these treaties, we must ask whether the countries that signed these treaties express sympathy for Japan's breach of faith and whether they allow the authority of international treaties to be completely swept away. We firmly believe that your government is deeply concerned about the well-being of the Chinese people. We, therefore, earnestly request your government, together with the other three friendly nations, to uphold the proposed five-point mediation plan to resolve the crisis between China and Japan. It must be understood that Japan's occupation of Manchuria, even for one day, is a major obstacle to world peace and will endanger the security of other countries. This is why the major powers have repeatedly offered good-faith mediation, but Japan has exaggerated the matter and labeled it as interference. We earnestly hope that your government, together with other signatory nations, for the sake of lasting peace in the Far East, will advise the Japanese government to respect the treaties it has signed. In the event that Japan cannot accept the advice, we urge you to resolutely join the three friendly nations and other signatory nations in implementing economic sanctions or other swift and effective methods to seek world peace. Otherwise, the dignity of treaties cannot be guaranteed, justice and fairness cannot be maintained, and the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty will all be ridiculed by the world. The international situation will become increasingly critical, inevitably plunging the entire world into an irreparable state.

<h3>General Jiang Guangnai's Remarks</h3>
<p>Disregarding Success or Failure</p>
<p>Upholding International Agreements</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, Jiang Guangnai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, on the one hand, deeply grieves over the enormous losses and on the other hand believes that a fundamental awakening of the various countries of the world is the basis for the establishment of international organizations. Hearing that the League of Nations was established with the aim of creating a foundation for peace, the author was overjoyed. During this period, the US government convened the Washington Conference, with the aim of achieving genuine world peace. When the Nine-Power Treaty was signed, the world believed that it not only guaranteed China's sovereignty but was also a harbinger of world peace. With the Kellogg-Briand Pact concluded, the hope for peace grew even greater. Our country has always adhered to the principle of loving peace and is one of the signatories to the aforementioned treaties. We not only strictly adhere to the letter of the treaties but also respect the spirit of the treaties. This is evident to all. Unfortunately, China's goodwill for peace has not been understood by its neighbor, Japan, which has repeatedly infringed upon our sovereignty and repeatedly violated international agreements. At this point, we cannot help but recall the horrors of the European war as if they were still before our eyes. However, China is determined to safeguard world peace and will not tolerate Japan's actions to undermine it. Therefore, we will unite the entire country and exert all our efforts to uphold the international agreements that are now being destroyed. Protecting our country is precisely maintaining world peace. Success or failure is not our concern.</p>
<p>Telegram from Jiang Guangnai and others: To all newspapers, organizations, and compatriots from all walks of life, since the night of last month, the violent Japanese have attacked Shanghai. For self-defense, we have resisted with force. After weeks of bloody fighting, the violent Japanese have exhausted their naval, land, and air forces to fight us, resulting in numerous casualties on both sides, but they have not succeeded. Our army has seized and destroyed many Japanese armored vehicles and aircraft. Guangnai and others, motivated by the sacred duty of self-defense and believing that there is justice and fairness in the international community, are commanding officers and soldiers who are loyal and brave, preferring death to retreat. Compatriots and comrades at home and abroad, deeply grieved by the crisis of the nation, are urged to rise up together and provide spiritual and material assistance. We are deeply grateful. Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, [Kowtow], Yang.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Drop Bombs Everywhere</h3>
<p>Damage Extends to the Settlements</p>
<p>Over Ten Bombs in the Route MacKenize Area Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, four Japanese planes flew east, indiscriminately dropping bombs on the area around Route MacKenize, Tatung Road, Soochow Creek Road, and Communications Road, totaling over ten bombs. One bomb landed in Soochow Creek west of the New Zhapei Bridge, injuring a boatman. One landed on Soochow Creek Road, injuring three pedestrians. The remaining bombs landed in areas such as Tatung Road and Route MacKenize, but did not explode and did not injure anyone. Later, our army used anti-aircraft guns to fire at them, so they circled the area for about fifteen minutes, and then flew east. At 3:30 PM, two more Japanese planes flew over the area, circling for several minutes and dropping several bombs, which also did not explode. Then they flew east.</p>
<h3>Over Ten Bombs Dropped in the Western Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th) morning around 11:00 AM, two Japanese planes flew over the area along Soochow Creek in western Shanghai, including Jessfield Road and Avenue Haig. They circled for several weeks, dropping over ten bombs, and then flew towards Zhapei. It is reported that the places where the bombs were dropped include: (1) No. 86, Route Maximum, formerly the residence of Ming Run-shen, now a "villa" occupied by a Westerner, was hit by a bomb, destroying a corner of the southwest-facing building, but fortunately, no one was injured. The location is very close to the British military headquarters on Great Western Road. (2) A bomb also landed on the roof of the International Settlement Fire Brigade in Wucaichang, Caojiadu, but fortunately, it did not explode, only slightly damaging the lead sheets on the roof. (3) A bomb was also dropped in front of the home of a villager north of Xujiazhai on Zhongshan Road North, north of the Avenue Haig embankment, injuring an old woman's foot.</p>
<h3>Two Places Damaged by Bombs: Cars and Roofs</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10:45 AM, Japanese planes dropped bombs in the Yuyuan Road area of western Shanghai. At that time, car No. 10305 was parked in front of No. 12 Kaen Road. The rear of the car was blown a hole in it. Also, the roof and walls of an American soap factory at No. 86 Jessfield Road were also damaged by bombs.</p>
<h3>One Bomb on Yuyuan Road Injures Several People</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, four Japanese planes flew to the Caojiadu and Yuyuan Road areas of western Shanghai, indiscriminately dropping bombs, totaling over ten. This created a hole, shaped like a plum blossom, in the road next to the 110 Liulin Villa, west of 111 Yuyuan Road, across the street, injuring three men and one woman. They were sent to the Red Cross Hospital by police car for treatment.

<h3>Stray Bullets in Both Settlements</h3>
<p>People Injured and Property Damaged</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a total of seven places within the French Concession were hit by stray bullets from Japanese planes, damaging houses and injuring people, causing considerable unease among residents. A separate investigation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Huanghe Road Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, a bullet exploded at the northeast corner of No. 1 Renlin Lane, Huanghe Road, French Concession, blasting a hole in the cement and injuring the back of Madam Sun, a resident of No. 9.

<p>The Ta Mei Wan Pao reported that last night (the 8th) and this morning, dozens of mortar shells and anti-aircraft shells fell within the areas administered by the Municipal Council, injuring many people. The wife of Robertson, a British superintendent of the police force, was also among the injured. She was reportedly walking on Avenue Edward VII when she was hit in the head by shrapnel from a shell, causing serious injuries. The area around the Dixwell Road Police Station was constantly hit by shells, totaling about thirty. Head Constable Walker evacuated the area with his staff by truck after 10:00 AM this morning. This morning, seven shells landed within the boundaries of the International Settlement, and one also landed within the French Concession. Countless shells landed on Dixwell Road. This morning, a shell landed between the McTyeire School and Avenue Edward VII, injuring a Chinese passerby. At the Jessfield Road sub-police station, a shell lodged in the corner of a wall without injuring anyone. Another shell landed near the intersection of Jessfield Road and Connaught Road. Also, last night, the glass window of a foreigner's residence near Kaen Road was shattered by a shell. On Jessfield Road, another Chinese passerby was hit by a bullet and injured. A shell hit the Fumin Hospital on North Szechuen Road last night, but it did not explode. Also, a shell landed on Route Paul Beau Road, damaging only a section of the road without injuring anyone.</p>
<h3>Various Military Reports from the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Nomura Arrives in Shanghai The Zi Lin Bao reported that Lieutenant General Nomura, newly appointed to Shanghai to succeed Rear Admiral Shiozawa in commanding the Japanese Navy, arrived yesterday (the 8th). His flagship is docked in front of the Japanese Consulate General. The flagship of Rear Admiral Shiozawa is now anchored midstream in the Huangpu River, moored to a buoy. Last night, Nomura met with representatives of the press on the flagship and gave a brief explanation of his policy towards China. Not only was a representative of the Consul present, but Rear Admiral Shiozawa was also in the room, so this conversation can be given double the attention. Nomura attended the Washington Naval Conference as a naval attaché to the United States and is usually known as a naval diplomat. He told the press representatives that the Japanese Navy's goal is to protect the safety and rights of Japanese residents in China. Shanghai has a special character, and he will do his best to avoid further disputes and will cooperate with representatives of other countries to resolve the Shanghai Incident as soon as possible in order to achieve the Japanese Navy's goals. He also said that he has long heard of Admiral Kelly, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy, but has not yet met him. He has met Rear Admiral Taena, Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy, two or three times. Later, when reporters asked Rear Admiral Shiozawa about the Japanese military strength in Shanghai, Shiozawa refused to announce it, only saying that the current number of marine corps on shore is about four thousand. He also refused to announce the number of reinforcements arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Pao reported that Nomura visited Rear Admiral Taena, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, and Admiral Kelly, Commander-in-Chief of the British Asiatic Fleet, this morning (the 9th). The two commanders are expected to return the visit this afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Izumo's Marine Corps Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>The Japanese-language newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported that the captain of the special marine corps of the battleship Izumo led marine corps members and was about to land on the enemy's (referring to our army) trenches in Wusong, when they were surrounded by enemy ambushes. Our army (the Japanese army) was unaware of the geography and was caught in the enemy's encirclement. As of the evening of the 8th, there was still no news. It is feared that they may have been completely annihilated. (Translated from the Japanese version)</p>
<h3>Two Warships Run Aground, One Behind the Other</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the Japanese destroyer No. 22 has run aground in the Huangpu River, approximately one mile south of the Wusong Fortress. Also, the Japanese destroyer No. 26, which ran aground on a beach outside the mouth of the Wusong River several days ago, has still not been refloated. According to eyewitnesses last night, the crew is currently busy making repairs.</p>
<h3>Trucks Full of Japanese Soldiers' Corpses</h3>
<p>The Hua Dong News Agency reported that yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, a worker Zhang from a certain factory escaped to Zhabei via the Western Stadium Road. He said that although the factory is in the midst of the storm, it has not been harmed in the slightest. However, most of the workers have left the factory on their own. Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, nine large trucks, full of Japanese soldiers' corpses, passed by the factory and headed towards Yangshupu. Each truck was estimated to be carrying no less than one or two hundred bodies.</p>
<h3>Japanese Airfield Established at Gao Miao</h3>
<p>A Japanese airfield has been established on the Puxi side, opposite the Meifu Oil Depot at Gao Miao.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Warship Enters Nanshi</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, a Japanese warship, numbered 2, carrying many marine corps members, sailed to Nanshi and docked at Wharf No. 2, in the center of the Puxi.</p>
<h3>False Propaganda by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Regarding the suspension of police power in the Hongkou district, the Japanese Press Association issued a statement last Friday, which stated, "Settlement police and firefighters voluntarily temporarily suspended their duties." This is completely inconsistent with the facts. The police were unable to exercise their authority, and the rescue team of the Hongkou Fire Brigade stopped working at the request of the Japanese naval authorities. Firefighters were also unable to perform their daily duties.</p>
<h3>The Burning of the Odeon Area</h3>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Pao reported that on January 30th, Japanese sailors and ruffians set fire to the houses near the Odeon Theatre and prevented the fire brigade from rescuing them. At that time, a team of reporters from a newspaper witnessed the scene. However, on February 1st, the Japanese Information Office in Tianjin issued a leaflet, claiming that a major fire broke out near the Odeon Theatre on January 30th, and the public believed that it was arson by Chinese plainclothes agents. The Japanese fire brigade and the International Settlement Fire Brigade rushed to put out the fire, which is still burning. The Japanese's skill in lying is evident from this.</p>
<h3>Consular Body Forms Investigating Committee</h3>
<p>Investigating Chinese People Illegally Arrested by Japanese Troops</p>
<p>One Hundred and Seventeen People Have Been Released</p>
<p>The Shanghai Consular Body, at the request of the Municipal Council, has appointed a committee to investigate and question the Chinese people arrested by Japanese troops. The committee members are Norwegian Consul-General Ar. Ensign, Deputy Judge Chung Sze of the Procuratorate, Luo Shi, an official of the Italian Embassy, Bo Liang, a lawyer of the Municipal Council, and Grigg, an official of the Municipal Council, who was appointed as secretary, responsible for liaison. The committee does not have judicial powers.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the undeclared war in this city, those deemed to be secretly attacking or suspected by the Japanese troops have been subjected to severe punishment. Therefore, the issue of the arrest and treatment of prisoners by the Japanese troops was brought to the Municipal Council, which proposed the establishment of a court to investigate the accused and prevent innocent people from being killed. At the same time, since the incidents in the Northern and Eastern Districts, the whereabouts of some Chinese people have been unknown, and many have inquired with the Municipal Council. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided to request the Consular Body to send an international committee to investigate the guilt of those detained and to propose solutions, hoping that after the recommendations of the committee, the Japanese authorities could send these prisoners to the competent court for trial or other satisfactory arrangements. At the end of last week, 117 people were sent by the Japanese authorities to the Municipal Council Police Department, of which 52 were refugees. On the morning of this Monday, the investigation committee sent by the Consular Body held its first meeting. From now on, those who wish to inquire about the whereabouts of their relatives and friends can inquire at the General Police Department, Room 328, 4th Floor, Municipal Council Office.</p>
<p>Of the 117 Chinese people previously handed over by the Japanese authorities to the Police Department of the Municipal Council, 52 were refugees and have been released. The Japanese Consul informed the investigation committee of the Consular Body yesterday morning (the 9th) that the consulate did not intend to file charges with the Special District Court. The investigation committee held a meeting at 11:00 AM and, since the Japanese consulate did not formally file charges, the Municipal Council instructed the Police Chief to release all those detained. However, one of them, who had worked at the Astor House Hotel, unfortunately died in custody due to illness. In addition, 64 people were completely freed in the afternoon.</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, the list submitted by the Japanese authorities contained a total of 130 names, but only 117 people were handed over. The Japanese claimed that 13 people had already been released. Also, these 130 people were all arrested on February 3rd. As for the Chinese people arrested before and after February 3rd, the Japanese Consulate has not yet reported to the committee.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Writes to Municipal Council to Investigate the Whereabouts of Xiang Songmao and Others</h3>
<p>Guanghe Firm Asks Taxpayers' Association to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Settlement wrote to the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting that it seriously investigate the whereabouts of Xiang Songmao and others with the Japanese Consul General. The original letter read: "Dear Sir, according to a letter from the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, Mr. Xiang Songmao, a supervisor of our association, went to Route Edward VII on January 30th to inspect the Wuzhou Pharmacy and disappeared. It is rumored that he was arrested and harmed by the plainclothes team of the Japanese army. Since the Japanese soldiers invaded the territory, the plainclothes team has been killing and setting fires in the Hongkou area, doing whatever they want. The Public Settlement's police authorities have not taken effective measures to protect the residents of the settlement, allowing them to act lawlessly, which is appalling. Therefore, we hereby request your association to forward a letter to the Municipal Council, requesting it to seriously negotiate with the Japanese consul, ordering them to withdraw from the settlement, and investigate the whereabouts of Mr. Xiang. If he is only detained and not harmed, he should be released immediately. If he has been killed, the body should be retrieved so that personnel can be sent to claim it, and the perpetrators should be strictly investigated in order to maintain international law and protect wartime humanitarianism. We sincerely hope for this, etc. Also, according to the report from Qian Zugen and Qian Zurang, the manager and eleven colleagues of the Taixing Cigarette Shop at No. 1423 Wusong Road, Hongkou, were arrested by the Japanese army at 5:00 or 6:00 AM on January 30th and have not been heard from since. Their names are Qian Weiqing, Qian Dayuan, Huang Xun-chu, Chen Shijian, Sha Yutong, Hu Qingxiang, Zhang Rongfu, Hua Zhicun, Zhou Shaoqi, and an apprentice. Also, according to the report from Li Yaochi, He Changchi, a 22-year-old Cantonese, was detained by the Japanese army in the 3rd Brigade of the Japanese Elementary School. Please rescue him, etc. Also, according to the letter from Chen Ziwen, his nephew Chen Zengnian, an 18-year-old from Zhenhai Haipu, Zhejiang, was an apprentice at the Yida Egg Shop at No. 1297 Wusong Road in Shanghai. On the night of January 29th, Japanese soldiers broke down the door and forcibly took him away along with seven friends. Several days have passed, and there is no news of their whereabouts. We respectfully request your association to forward a letter to the Municipal Council to investigate their whereabouts, etc. Also, according to the letter from lawyer Huang Jue, his client Wang Xufang, also known as Wang Mengtu, 40 years old, a Ningbo Dinghai native, wearing a Western suit, lives at No. 1549 Shendeli, East Seward Road. On January 30th, he was arrested by the plainclothes team of the Japanese army on Route Edward VII and taken to the Japanese military headquarters. Wang Xufang, also known as Mengtu, is a resident of the Public Settlement. We hereby specially inform your association for your information and request that you immediately forward a letter to the Municipal Council to investigate and rescue him, etc. The Japanese army's harm to civilians is a loss of the qualifications of a modern country and a destruction of your bureau's duty to protect civilians, which is truly hateful. We sincerely hope that your bureau will immediately investigate this matter for the public convenience."</p>
<p>Guanghe Fruit Store's letter to the Taxpayers' Association stated, "Dear Sir, Guanghe Fruit Store at No. 1579 Wusong Road, Hongkou, was suddenly invaded by the Japanese army around 6:00 AM on January 31st. Under the pretext of searching, they wantonly destroyed the store's property and goods, and then arrested the store employees Xiao Mingguang, accountant Zhong Yujun, and He Huichuan together, and have not been released to this day. Our store is located in the Public Settlement, and the police power to protect the safety of citizens belongs to the Municipal Council, the highest authority of the Public Settlement. Our store has always paid taxes and donations and has never been in arrears. Now that we have suffered a sudden disaster, we should request relief from the Municipal Council and find a way to rescue the three arrested people and ask the Japanese army to release them. We believe that your association is the leader of the taxpayers of the city, and we sincerely request your assistance to forward a letter to the Municipal Council for negotiation. We cannot express the urgency of our hope."</p>
<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Urges Donations to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Fellow Countrymen, Wake Up!</p>
<p>Fellow Countrymen, Rise Up!</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a public notice, urging chambers of commerce at home and abroad, as well as all sectors of the city, to enthusiastically donate funds. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, Japanese militarists, with their insatiable military ambitions, first occupied the Northeast and then attacked Shanghai. The flames of their poisonous ambitions are raging increasingly fiercely. This is precisely the critical moment for the survival of our nation, the day of fierce struggle for existence. Without the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and to seek survival in the face of death, there is no way to mount a long-term resistance and rescue the nation from imminent demise. Although the valiant soldiers of the Nineteenth Route Army have staunchly defended Shanghai, repeatedly repelling enemy attacks and remaining unscathed to this day, the Japanese, with their cunning and ruthless determination, harbor the ambition to sweep across the mainland. Reinforcements arrive in a continuous stream, and the cabinet has even specially allocated 40 million yen for Shanghai war expenses. The prolongation of the war is indeed within expectations. The national crisis is pressing, and the extent of its reach is unknown. Everything depends on the united will of the people, doing their utmost to support the Nineteenth Route Army soldiers with their capabilities and financial resources. Only then can we, with unwavering determination, crush the raging poisonous flames of the mad aggressors. It must be understood that Shanghai is the key hub of commerce and the vital center of finance and taxation. If, unfortunately, there is any negligence, the national economy will be blockaded, and government resources will be exhausted. Without Shanghai, there is no China. This meaning is extremely clear and needs no further explanation. Therefore, we sincerely appeal to your association to inspire the people, unite to resist aggression, and do your best to raise substantial funds to provide comfort and compensation for the soldiers fighting on the front lines. We hope to unite the military and boost morale. We eagerly anticipate that donations can be submitted to our association for forwarding. This statement is hereby made jointly.</p>
<h3>Mob Angrily Destroys Tram Cars in Front of the French Concession Police Station at the Sixteenth Pier</h3>
<p>A Japanese Person Happened to Come from Xinkai River</p>
<p>Resulting in the Destruction of Twenty-Nine Tram Cars</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6:15 PM, French Concession Police Officer No. 16 was patrolling the Xinkai River area when he suddenly spotted a Chinese youth resembling a coolie carrying a leather suitcase from east to west. The suitcase seemed quite heavy. The officer immediately stepped forward to inspect it. The suitcase had Japanese characters on it, which made the officer even more suspicious. He questioned the youth carrying the suitcase. According to the youth, two passengers at the wharf had just hired him to carry it. However, when asked where the passengers were, the youth was evasive. At that time, the officer immediately ordered the Chinese police officer to take the youth and the suitcase to the police station. Before even a quarter of an hour had passed, two Japanese men rushed over, looking flustered. They immediately approached French Concession Police Officer No. 16 and asked if he had seen a man carrying a suitcase pass by. They identified themselves as Oguchi Goro, 44 years old, and Shimada Fujio, 36 years old, both key members of the Nanjing News Agency. They had arrived in Shanghai by boat from Nanjing the day before and had just reached the port. They had hired a Chinese coolie to carry a suitcase, but he had suddenly disappeared. While they were talking, they were spotted by passersby, who noticed the suspicious behavior of the two Japanese men. Fearing that they were enemy spies or were planning to cause trouble in the Nanshi area, they paid special attention to them. French Concession Police Officer No. 16 planned to escort the two men to the police station, and the crowd followed closely behind. Unexpectedly, when they reached the vicinity of the Sixteenth Pier police station, the crowd had gathered to more than six or seven hundred people, and they all clamored loudly. After the two Japanese men arrived at the police station, the crowd gathered at the entrance and refused to disperse. The police chief urgently used the phone to notify the special branch of the French Concession Police, which immediately dispatched a large number of armed reserve teams to suppress the crowd. At the same time, the fire department was notified to urgently send a fire truck to spray the crowd with water. At this point, the crowd could no longer tolerate it and threw rocks at the police and tram cars. All the tram cars arriving at the Sixteenth Pier stopped operating. As a result, twenty-nine tram cars of the French tram company were damaged, as well as five tram cars of the Public Concession: Route 1, cars 1, 3, and 104; Route 2, cars 41, 74, 95, 14, 117, 127, 99, 43, 115, 62, 4, 114, 61, 77, 6, 72, and 7, and 125; Route 6, cars 32, 37, and 39; Route 7, cars 101 and 102; Route 10, cars 111, 113, and 118. The reserve team then raised their guns, threatening to shoot, and the crowd dispersed to avoid casualties. The conductor of car number 209 was seriously injured by the French police and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Therefore, the French Concession police tightened security last night. Even those with passes were carefully inspected before being allowed to pass. A large number of people wearing armbands with the French tricolor flag were arrested and taken to the police station.</p>
<h3>Shipping News Amidst the War Clouds of Songkou</h3>
<p>Wusong Customs Officers Flee to Shanghai Yesterday Morning: The Japanese army continued to attack the Wusong Jianghai Customs office, and the Western personnel of the River Management Bureau and the staff inspecting imported ships at the observation tower, due to the intense shelling and life-threatening conditions, could no longer stay in service. Therefore, the entire group withdrew last night, taking a small boat and arriving in Shanghai at 9 PM, and have already reported to the Jianghai Customs. A certain gentleman in the Customs telephone office, his family of seven was brutally killed by Japanese soldiers, leaving only one survivor. He escaped from the Japanese headquarters and arrived at the Customs yesterday morning. According to his account, the ordeal was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Forcibly Inspects British Ship</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British Taikoo Company's Northern Seas liner "Shuntian" departed from Shanghai for Yantai. During the armistice between the two armies, it sailed away from Wusong. Unexpectedly, as it left the Songkou, a Japanese warship approached and stopped it by force. The captain of the ship, a Westerner named Hande, repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese military, but to no avail. All the passengers on board were strictly searched. After the search was completed, they were released. It is now reported that British ships leaving the port will be escorted by warships.</p>
<h3>Merchant Ships Risk Entering the Port</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sanbei Company's "Xingshi" vessel, the Taikoo Company's "Datong" vessel, and the "Wuhu" vessel all arrived in Shanghai from the Yangtze River. Due to the Wusong battle, they could not enter the port. It wasn't until noon yesterday, during the armistice between the two armies, that they dared to venture into the Huangpu River. According to the crew members of the ships, although the sound of gunfire gradually subsided when passing through Wusong, the smoke from the burning houses of the Wusong residents filled the sky, almost completely obscuring it. The tragic situation was truly rare.</p>
<h3>Fewer Refugees Leaving the City</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, most of the refugees from Shanghai have fled to Ningbo. According to estimates by various shipping companies, in the past ten days, at least 300,000 to 400,000 refugees have fled to Ningbo by boat. Approximately 60,000 to 70,000 have fled to Suzhou and other places along the Yangtze River, heading to Zhenjiang, while nearly 200,000 have traveled by train to Hangzhou and Jiaxing, and then on to the interior. If the travel expenses for each person are at least five yuan, then the amount spent on fleeing has reached three to four million yuan. In recent days, the number of people fleeing is not as crowded as in the previous few days. Yesterday, the Ningbo ships did not depart due to the ongoing war in Wusong, and were planned to leave Shanghai today instead. Many travelers have boarded the ships, waiting to depart.</p>
<h3>Guangfu Returns Safely to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai chartered the "Guangfu" steamship to transport Ningbo refugees back to their hometown. When it departed a few days ago, there were rumors that the ship had been detained by Japanese warships due to the alert in Wusong. It is now known that the ship returned safely to Shanghai at noon yesterday. The Ningbo Native Association, having facilitated the return of fellow countrymen to their hometowns, and with the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping routes resuming one after another, has canceled the charter of the ship. It is said that the ship has already sailed on its own yesterday.</p>
<h3>Allied Warships and Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>The American transport ship "Black Hawk," under orders, loaded a large number of munitions, aircraft, and supplies from Luzon and sailed to Shanghai. It entered the port at noon yesterday and immediately sailed into the Huangpu River, docking next to the American warship "He Tong" to facilitate the unloading and distribution of supplies to the American troops stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Shanghai dispatch, dated the 9th: The French armored cruiser "Waldeck-Rousseau," carrying a battalion of infantry from Haiphong, Vietnam, will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Furthermore, a battalion of French infantry stationed in Tianjin will arrive in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Notes on Inspection of Hongkou</h3>
<p>A reporter from the National News Agency went to the Hongkou area for inspection at 6:00 PM yesterday. He saw that there were no Japanese soldiers on the Waibaidu Bridge, and traffic was flowing freely. At the intersection of Tiantong Road north of the bridge, in front of the Japanese Telegraph Office, barbed wire was placed, and Japanese soldiers and plainclothes personnel were stationed there, cutting off traffic. Tram Route 7 and Public Bus Route 10 were detoured through Waihongqiao. He then turned onto Broadway Road and saw that the Chinese and Indian police officers were on duty as usual. A machine gun was set up at Waihongqiao, and Japanese soldiers were also stationed there. In front of the Yeesan Shipyard, owned by foreign merchants, at the foot of the bridge, sandbags were piled up and guarded by two American soldiers. Further north to Huaji Road and Zhaofeng Road, he turned into East and West Huade Road, Tangshan Road, Xinjihang Road, and Dongyouheng Road. Along the way, Chinese and Western police officers were patrolling, and the order was good. The Harbin Police Station and the Hongkou Police Station were still occupied by Japanese soldiers. The police officers and Chinese police officers were temporarily working at the Zhuangyuan Dachangchun Teahouse. The Lihongqiao, Dian Dengqiao, Sikaiziqiao, West Jiaxingqiao, East Jiaxingqiao, and Oujialuqiao bridges along the river were all fortified with sandbags and barbed wire by Japanese soldiers, who patrolled back and forth and inspected any Chinese they encountered. However, few people were seen. As traffic was blocked in the Shenjiawan Qiujiang Road area, he turned north to the Wuzhou Road Xiaocaichang and the entrance of the Engineering Department of the Public Works Bureau at the end of Yuezhou Road, which were guarded by the Volunteer Corps of the International Settlement. In general, the situation in the area north of the Middle Hongqiao was still peaceful, but the residents were still evacuating, and the shops were closed, making the scene bleak.</p>
<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Department, Requesting the Immediate Taking Over of Police Authority in the Hongkou District</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: Respectfully, the Japanese soldiers' provocations in Zhabei have triggered a war that has harmed both the Chinese and Concession areas. Businesses and factories have been suspended. Our Chamber is currently resolving to advise the businesses and factories in the city, especially those in the safe areas, to resume operations to stabilize the people's minds, reduce unemployment, and gradually restore the old ways. However, it is found that since the outbreak of the war, the entire Hongkou area has been defended by the Japanese army. Therefore, the residents in that area have suffered extremely cruelly from the war. Although your bureau has discussed gradually taking back the police power in that area, the proposed method still involves Chinese and Indian police officers patrolling together with the Japanese army and plainclothes personnel. Thus, the Chinese and Indian police officers are under the control of the Japanese army and cannot freely exercise their authority. The shops have become like frightened birds and will find it difficult to resume business. This is contrary to our Chamber's purpose of vigorously urging the resumption of operations and restoring order. It is found that Japan's excuse for not completely returning the police power of Hongkou to your bureau is that the police force is weak and cannot maintain the security of that area. Now, British and American troops are arriving one after another, and their strength has increased, which is enough to fully divide the Concession into areas for defense, assisting the Chinese and Indian police officers where they are unable to do so. After deliberation by the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of our Chamber, we hereby write to your bureau, requesting that you take steps as soon as possible to withdraw the violent Japanese troops from the Japanese-guarded area in Hongkou, so as to restore business and calm the hearts of the people. The corresponding record is hereby sent to your bureau for your review and prompt handling, and a response is requested.</p>
<h3>Investigation by the City Police Bureau</h3>
<p>The City Police Bureau yesterday dispatched a special investigator to Songjiang to investigate the truth about the sudden disappearance of Zhao Ze Zhou, the District Chief of the Seventh District of Wusong. However, according to the report from the dispatched investigator, the Seventh District Police Bureau is in the war zone and could not be reached. They had to investigate nearby and learned that District Chief Zhao of the Seventh District had likely left, and the police station was unharmed. The First Sub-station of the Seventh District is located in Yunzaobang, so the station has now been evacuated from the war zone by Chief Zeng Keguang and all the police officers.</p>
<p>The Fourth Sub-station of the Fifth District of the Yinxianggang Police Bureau was temporarily occupied by the Japanese army, but was soon recaptured by our army. The Japanese plainclothes personnel and marines, about thirty or so, who were occupying the police station, fled in different directions. It was found that the area was not a strategic location, but since it was occupied by the enemy, it had to be taken back.</p>
<h3>The Closing of the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>The Entire Factory Was Destroyed, Resulting in Significant Losses</p>
<p>The General Manager and Assistant Manager Have All Been Suspended from Their Duties</p>
<p>The Commercial Press was bombed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft in this incident and has announced its closure. The Press is the only cultural and educational institution in our country, and its sudden misfortune has attracted great attention from society. According to the person in charge of the Press, the main factory and the Oriental Library, located in Baoshan Road, Zhabei, were the essence and the largest part of the company's assets. They were completely destroyed by Japanese aircraft, and the losses are beyond description. Moreover, the rare books and complete sets of local chronicles of the country stored in the Oriental Library were also destroyed, and their loss cannot be calculated in terms of money. After the main factory was bombed, the company, mindful of the difficult lives of its colleagues, immediately distributed ten silver dollars to each person. Subsequently, the board of directors, due to the total destruction of the main factory and the exhaustion of assets, with no way to maintain finances and no way for employees to work, after repeated discussions, had no choice but to decide to shut down the entire Shanghai headquarters and suspend all employees, and issue an additional half-month's salary to each person. The company has done its best to provide considerable assistance to all its colleagues in this extremely difficult situation. As for the company's own aftermath, as the cleaning of the remaining ruins will take time and cannot be completed in a short period of time, it will have to wait for the overall situation to stabilize and await the resolution of the shareholders' meeting. The general manager and assistant manager have also been suspended from their duties. Currently, a special committee organized by the board of directors is handling the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Both Banks of the Suzhou River are Covered with Barbed Wire</h3>
<p>Refugees Cannot Land at Will</p>
<p>Only the Space Between the Old Garbage Bridge is Open</p>
<p>The residents of Zhabei, except for the destitute who were rescued by charitable organizations, have fled on their own. Those who want to escape to the Concession can only take small boats along the Suzhou River from west to east due to traffic restrictions. In recent days, the military authorities of the Public Concession, in view of the seriousness of the situation, have covered both banks of the Suzhou River with barbed wire, and sandbags have been piled up at the southern end of the Old Garbage Bridge, so refugees cannot land at will. Fortunately, a net has been opened on one side, opening up the pier between the Old Garbage Bridge and the Old Zha Bridge. Therefore, all ships transporting refugees from the west of the Suzhou River are parked there. When each boat arrives, men, women, old and young rush to land. The police have specially dispatched several patrol officers to take care of them all day long, so although the crowd is crowded, the order is not chaotic.</p>

She was admitted to the China Public Hospital on Hengbang Road, Zhabei, due to smallpox, and was getting better. Recently, she suddenly developed a fever and swollen feet, so she could not leave the hospital before the outbreak of the war. Unexpectedly, all the employees of the hospital fled on the 29th, abandoning the patients. When Lingxiao ventured to the hospital to rescue her on the 31st of last month, he searched all the rooms in the hospital and could not find his mother. Even the bedding and utensils used by his mother were gone. He then inquired at the Chinese Red Cross Hospital and found no trace. His mother has not been in Shanghai for long and speaks only Cantonese, not Shanghai dialect. It is difficult to guess whether she was rescued by someone or taken in by nearby residents.

<p>Relief Work</p>
<h3>The City Health Bureau Allocates Subsidies for Injury Relief</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government has allocated 15,000 yuan to assist with the relief of wounded soldiers, instructing the Health Bureau to manage the matter. The Bureau has designated several hospitals to prepare a total of 1,000 beds and has sent personnel to investigate the number of patients admitted and the treatment situation on a daily basis. The Bureau has also prepared tetanus antitoxin serum and has sent a letter to the Charity Federation Office to collect cotton clothing to be used in various hospitals. All the donations from the Municipal Government have been allocated by the Finance Bureau yesterday, and the Health Bureau has immediately issued separate letters to the General Office of the Chinese Red Cross, the Red Cross General Hospital, the Shanghai Public Hospital, the Xin Puyu Tang Hospital, the Pushan Villa, the Pushan Hospital, the Tongren Fuyuan Tang, the Red Swastika Society, etc., to be collected to subsidize the relief of wounded soldiers and civilians.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Transports Refugees to the Interior for Care</h3>
<p>Since receiving the order from the Municipal Government to handle refugee relief matters, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau dispatched personnel to Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Songjiang, Xiashi, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yixing and other places on the 6th to contact local institutions and organizations for the reception of refugees, and to send boats to Shanghai for transportation. In the afternoon of the 7th, the Jiaxing National Disaster Relief Association sent Ji Baozhen with a boat to Shanghai, sending out more than 400 refugees yesterday. In addition to the boat fare paid by the Social Affairs Bureau, the Association will handle the follow-up care and reception matters. Also, the Suzhou side has sent two ships that can accommodate 900 people, and the Social Affairs Bureau and the Temporary Relief Association will send the refugees to board the ships, which will depart this afternoon. The boat fare will be subsidized by the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce. Overall, the results of this contact are very satisfactory. Relief organizations have been established by the Party, government, business, and joint associations in various places, and their efforts and speed are commendable.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Disaster Victims Sent to Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese military atrocities in this port, most of the residents of Zhabei, Western Shanghai, and Hongkou have been displaced. Although various charitable organizations and groups have organized shelters to provide relief as much as possible, the number of people is increasing day by day, and it is no longer possible to accommodate them. Moreover, there is a great shortage of both clothing and food. If this continues, it will be unthinkable. For remedial purposes, the various groups divided 400 Jiaxing-籍災民 (Jiaxing-originating disaster victims) from the various shelters, loaded them onto four civilian boats at 2:30 p.m. yesterday (the 9th), and towed them back to their native Jiaxing by an inland river small boat, so as to obtain safety.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Rescue News</h3>
<p>"Pay Attention to the Diseases of Disaster Victims" The Chinese Red Cross Rescue Team, in view of the large population in the refugee shelters everywhere, the risk of infectious diseases and transmission is very high, and the danger is real, specially dispatched doctor Zhang Zhisheng leading several nurses, carrying medicines every day, to go to various places for diagnosis and treatment separately. If there are pregnant women and babies, they will be taken to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. "Work of Each Detachment" The captain of the first detachment of the Red Cross Rescue Team, Hai Zongqi, departed at 8:30 a.m. on the 9th, from Zhenru to Zhongxing Road, Baoshan Road, and Gonghe Xin Road, and rescued three soldiers of the Fourth Regiment of the 78th Division, Li Baicai, Ren Shixing, and Liu Jin, and sent them to the Fifth Hospital, and more than 30 refugees. Yang Zhongfu, the captain of the fifth detachment, rescued a wounded civilian, Xue Renzhong, in Zhenru at 1:00 p.m. and sent him to the First Hospital, and rescued more than ten refugees in Jiangwan. At 12:00, the third detachment departed for the Guangdong Hospital on Gonghe Road and Tiantong An Road, and saw that a corner of the hospital was set on fire by an airplane bombing. Because of the emergency, they rescued three pregnant women, Mrs. Li Zhou, four boys, and sent them to various hospitals. Yao Zhian, the captain of the fourteenth detachment, rescued three wounded civilians on Tiantong An Road. Lu Hongyuan, the captain of the third detachment, rescued 14 refugees on Baoxing Road at 2:00 p.m. Yu Songyun, the captain of the sixth detachment, rescued three wounded soldiers at Tongji University in Wusong at 6:00 a.m., and one person died on the way, and the rest were sent to the Fifth Hospital for treatment. The Shanghai branch of the third detachment went to Zhabei to bury the dead in the afternoon and brought back two wounded civilians. A part of the members of the fourth team departed from Wusong at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, and only returned to the central medical gate at 10:00 p.m., rescuing more than 30 wounded soldiers and refugees. The place was very quiet and our soldiers were in high spirits. Some team members were completely engaged in rescue work on the front line of Zhabei yesterday, rescuing more than 20 wounded soldiers and refugees. However, team member Chen Huadong was seriously injured on the front line and has now returned to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Banning the Abuse of Red Cross Flags and Badges</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross held an emergency meeting yesterday because there were many Red Cross flags and armbands on the market. It was decided to request the authorities of the Chinese and Public Concessions to apply Article 28 of the International Red Cross Convention, which stipulates that during wartime, private individuals who misuse the Red Cross flag and Red Cross armbands shall be punished for the crime of illegally using military emblems. The scope of the treaty includes only health institutions belonging to the government (i.e. the Health Bureau and Health Teams) and institutions belonging to the Red Cross may use them.</p>
<h3>Chaozhou People Subsidize Medicines and 麻袋 (hemp sacks)</h3>
<p>Our association subsidized a large batch of medicines to the Fifth Wounded Soldier Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross on the 7th to rescue wounded soldiers.

<p>###狄思威 Police Station Temporarily Relocates Office</p>
<p>During the fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops the night before and yesterday morning, stray bullets flew across the area at the end of Dixiwei Road and North Sichuan Road, which was very dangerous.

The police chief immediately requested instructions from headquarters and began to move out the necessary items at 10:00 AM, completing the move at 3:30 PM, and relocating to the Hongkou Police Station to work.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hankou Aviation Route Resumes Flights Yesterday</h3>
<p>The westbound plane departed from Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>News of the resumption of the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou route: As reported in various newspapers, at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the westbound plane on this route, piloted by American pilot Anlisen, departed from Longhua Airport and flew to various stations along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The entire fuselage was painted postal green, with a postal character painted on each wing, about five feet in diameter, and a smaller postal character painted under each wing, about three feet in diameter. The six characters "China National Aviation Corporation" were written on both sides of the fuselage. It was clearly visible whether viewed from above, from the side, or from below. The plane carried four passengers and over 200 pounds of mail. It is also reported that due to the disruption of land and water transportation along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in recent days, mail delivery has been very slow, so most letter senders have switched to using airmail.</p>
<h3>Shangchuan Motor Vehicles Operate as Usual</h3>
<p>City ferries also operate on schedule.</p>
<p>The Chuansha area of Pudong, bordering the sea on the east, is a strategic point for Shanghai. Since the brutal Japanese army used force in Shanghai North, with giant ships and planes arriving in succession, the area has also been under pressure, causing slight panic among the coastal residents. However, in recent days, the focus of the war has shifted to the Wusong area. Although Japanese warships occasionally stop outside Bailonggang and Lao Hongwa in Chuansha, there are no landing activities, so the morale in the area has gradually stabilized. The Shangchuan Company's long-distance buses, which added temporary buses to the original schedule at the end of the lunar year due to the large number of evacuees, are still operating as usual, connecting with the city ferries. Rumors that the company's buses cannot depart on time are actually inaccurate.</p>
<h3>City National Arts Museum Organizes Big Sword Team</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese bandits invaded Shanghai, all members of the City National Arts Museum, being located within the war zone, have been undertaking temporary rescue work. It is now reported that the personnel in charge of the museum plan to convene national arts groups in the city to organize big sword teams and spear teams to assist the army in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, so as to implement the original intention of practicing national arts. It is said that the use of spears supplemented by big swords will be more effective.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers' Corpses, Four to a Coffin</h3>
<p>Temporarily Placed in Japanese Merchants' Warehouses</p>
<p>Loaded on Ships for Return</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side launched an unprovoked attack on the night of January 28th, more than ten days have passed, and the sound of gunfire has not ceased day and night. The enemy army retreats in every battle, and more than half of the soldiers have been killed or wounded. They must find ways to retrieve the corpses left on the battlefield, first transporting them by trolley to the Japanese ships at the Huishan Wharf, and then placing them in thin coffins. However, due to the large number of deaths each day, it is not possible to have one corpse per coffin. It is said that at least two corpses must be placed in each coffin, and some coffins contain four corpses. These coffins are initially temporarily placed in the Japanese merchants' warehouses in Pudong, waiting for Japanese ships to return to their country before being loaded in bulk. As for the Japanese soldiers and Japanese plainclothes teams who have arbitrarily slaughtered our Chinese civilians with no ability to resist since the start of the war, they immediately take away the corpses after killing them in order to destroy the evidence. It is now reported that these corpses are mostly transported by ship to the ocean and thrown into the sea, to be buried in the stomachs of fish.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ronin Set Fire and Loot</h3>
<p>At 7:30 this morning, Japanese ronin set fire and looted. Firefighters... negotiated with them. They... Numbers 8 and 9 contained Chinese plainclothes teams. Because Number 9... previously had the defense weapons prepared by the Home Guard, because they had not been taken out, the Japanese ronin used this as evidence, and then they were looted wantonly.</p>
<h3>Number of Unemployed Chinese in Concessions Due to War</h3>
<p>Over 160,000 People</p>
<p>Fei Xindun, Director-General of the Public Concession, expressed to people yesterday that he was very concerned about the current situation in Shanghai. Over 160,000 Chinese in the concession have become unemployed, which will affect the security and prosperity of the concession. However, he himself could not express any opinions on this.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Privately Rented Trucks and the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that according to people in the freight truck industry, since the brutal Japanese army invaded our Northeast Provinces, they have been implementing economic severance with Japan and have resolved to publish a notice to all members that they must not transport enemy goods. Now that the Japanese bandits have invaded Shanghai, people's hearts are even more agitated. The Japanese side has sent people to tempt members of the association with heavy profits. Recently, it has been discovered that Ge Qifu, the owner of the Hua Ji Lu Hua Fu Company, is greedy for profit and forgets righteousness, privately renting a large number of freight trucks to the Japanese bandits. This is truly heartless. It is heard that this case is being strictly investigated by the military and political authorities.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Domestic Market: Recently Loose, Distantly Tight</h3>
<p>Very Little New Trading</p>
<p>Silver Prices Vary</p>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the holiday, and all banks have opened. The prices of British and American silver did not change. Large bars were recently 19 pence 25, distantly 19 pence 375.

As for the HSBC listing in this port, only the French franc was slightly higher, at 823 francs per tael. The German exchange was slightly higher at 136.25 marks per tael. Hong Kong added 375, at 76 taels 875. The prices of other exchanges such as British and American remained unchanged. The domestic market in the banks seemed tight, and gold gangs hoarded a lot to offset most of their previous short positions. About 4-500,000 yuan of American dollars were traded, and after the short positions were cleared, no more than a few tens of thousands of pounds of British gold were traded. As a result, compared to before the closure (Lunar New Year's Eve), British gold was flat and American dollars decreased by 125. It was still recently looser and distantly tighter, but besides clearing, there was very little new trading.</p>
<p>The opening selling price of the British exchange domestic market in the morning was 1 shilling 11 pence to 10 pence 75, and the buying price added 125. The closing offering price at noon was 1 shilling 10 pence 875 to 625, and the buying price was 11 pence to 10 pence 75. The opening selling price of the American exchange domestic market in the morning was 32.75 yuan to 625, and the buying price was 875 to 75. The closing offering price at noon was 32.6875 yuan to half a yuan, and the buying price was 8125 to 625.</p>
<h3>Gold Industry Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Only Did Business for Half a Day</p>
<p>Added Special Margin of 20 Taels</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange, which had been closed since the Japanese invasion on January 30th for over a week, reopened as usual yesterday (the 9th), but only did business for half a day in the morning. The margin status was stable and even rose. Most of the transactions were settlements, with short positions being the majority, eager to cover their positions, and the settlement price was far from the US dollar settlement price, with the intention of suppressing it to 70 taels. Furthermore, with the exchange rate still holding firm, dealers were all continuing to advance, which boosted morale. The sellers were mainly short positions, who mostly took advantage of the opportunity to sell. New transactions were rare, especially because the Exchange had great changes in the current market. If there are new transactions, each margin will be charged an additional special margin of 30 taels, for a total of 60 taels including the original margin.</p>
<p>Before the closure, the March opening rose by 9 taels to 67... The large and small bars rose and... also... yuan.... The advance added up to 81... yuan. Yong and others... only three minutes... but nine taels, for seven... taels... 71 taels, due to gradual hoarding everywhere... 77 taels closed higher than before the closure (January 29th)... nine taels... about 70 taels pressed... the highest price on the market was 681 taels, the lowest was 71 taels, the book entry... the added three taels and five qian were not smooth.</p>
<h3>Chinese Isolation Hospital Busy</h3>
<p>Recruiting Nurses</p>
<p>The Chinese Isolation Hospital, which moved into the Ben's Building on Avenue Edward VII, will only accept patients from within the two concessions from today. The hospital urgently needs to add three Chinese nurses. The hospital has set up several other rooms to treat refugees suffering from smallpox. Those who wish to work as nurses can contact the nursing director of the hospital directly.</p>
<p>In addition, many of the organizations that are currently providing relief to refugees are not yet clear about the procedures of the Chinese Isolation Hospital for receiving patients with major infectious diseases. According to the investigation, the first requirement is to see if there are vacancies, and the second is that the patient must first be certified by a doctor, and the nursing director must be notified of the details. The telephone number is 82546. The infectious disease notification form can be obtained from Room 132 of the hospital.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Releases Report of Shanghai Consular Committee</h3>
<p>First Describes the Anti-Japanese Boycott Movement Caused by the Korean and Liaoning Cases, Then Notes that Japanese Residents in Shanghai Resent the Boycott and Accumulate Hatred, Followed by the Shanghai Japanese Consulate's Demands Taking Advantage of the Situation, with the Chinese Side Unable to Withdraw Troops Within the Deadline, and Finally Detailing the Landing and Combat Operations of Japanese Troops (Geneva) The report of the Consular Committee investigating the Shanghai Incident was released here today, stating that the Shanghai Incident originated from Japan's activities in Manchuria. After the Manchurian Incident, Chinese people boycotted Japanese goods, and Japanese residents resented the boycott and accumulated hatred. The report then described the events that led to the current war, and mentioned Shiozawa's demands, and the Chinese side's inability to agree to the troop withdrawal demands, as the deadline was short and troop withdrawal was impossible. Finally, it detailed the Japanese landing in Shanghai and the subsequent combat operations. Chinese representative Dr. Yen Hui-ching asked the Administrative Council to convene a meeting immediately to discuss the report, because what has happened in Shanghai in the past ten days is extremely concerning. Dr. Yen said that Japanese bombs and artillery have killed and wounded thousands of innocent men, women, and children, and tens of thousands of houses have been destroyed. The Japanese navy's current acts of terror and cruelty in the war mean that every minute of delay and hesitation by the League of Nations will increase the loss of life and property. Therefore, the responsibility of the League of Nations is very heavy (Reuters, 8th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Administrative Council has decided to hold an open meeting at 5 p.m. today to discuss the Shanghai issue (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Shanghai Investigation Team is composed of the Consuls General of Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and Norway, with Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano as chairman and Haas, director of the League of Nations' Transportation and Communications Division, as secretary-general. US Consul General Cunningham participated in the last meeting of the investigation team and read the first report of the investigation team. This report was sent to the League of Nations by telegram on the 6th of this month. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The team is commissioned by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to submit a report on the events that occurred in and near Shanghai. This first report is based on information gathered by ourselves, and the various sections mentioned therein must be extended or revised in detail. Subsequent events will also require separate reports. US Consul General Cunningham assisted in the work of the team. The task of the team is to submit a report on the causes, facts, and progress of the events that occurred in and near Shanghai.</p>
<p>The boycott of Japanese goods began in July 1931, as a result of the Korean Incident. Later, Manchuria was occupied, and the boycott of Japanese goods intensified and was strictly enforced. Japanese commerce suffered greatly as a result.</p>
<p>The boycott movement was encouraged by the Anti-Japanese Boycott Association, and various Chinese commercial organizations participated in its organization, which was divided into inspecting stores, detaining Japanese goods, imposing fines, detaining (this was aimed at Chinese people who purchased or sold Japanese goods), and other illegal acts. Those who suffered wanted to seek justice in the courts but were unable to. The Japanese expressed increasing dissatisfaction with China. The Japanese declared towards China that unless violent acts were immediately suppressed. Furthermore, Chinese people also showed disrespect towards the Japanese Emperor, which greatly angered the Japanese. The Japanese government was asked to take direct action to quell their intolerable situation. On January 28th, five Japanese, including a monk, were ambushed by Chinese people while passing through the SanYou Factory. Several of the Chinese people were believed to be members of the recently organized Anti-Japanese Volunteer Corps. The Chinese police arrived late, and the perpetrators were not arrested. Two of the ambushed Japanese were seriously injured, and one monk died from his injuries. On January 20th, about fifty Japanese, all members of the "Youth Protection Corps," armed with daggers and clubs, went to the SanYou Factory to set fire to the factory buildings. As they left, they had a brief clash with the police of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. Three Chinese policemen were injured, one of whom died from his injuries. Three Japanese were injured by Chinese police bullets, one of whom died shortly after. On the same day, the Japanese held a meeting of residents at the Japanese Club to protest the ambush of the Japanese monk and the disrespectful articles towards the Japanese Emperor in the newspapers. A resolution was immediately passed requesting the Japanese government to dispatch warships and troops to completely eliminate the anti-Japanese movement. Half of the Japanese protesters went to see the Japanese Consul General, and then went to the Japanese Naval Headquarters to present the aforementioned resolution. The Japanese Consul General asked the protesters to let him handle the matter. At this time, the protesters went to the Japanese Naval Headquarters, and clashed with the concession police on the way. One patrol officer was injured, and Japanese officials apologized to the concession authorities. Seven Japanese voluntarily turned themselves in to the Japanese authorities and were sent to Nagasaki for trial in accordance with Japanese law. On the afternoon of the same day, the Japanese Consul General made the following demands to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government regarding the January 19th incident: (1) The Mayor should make a formal apology; (2) The perpetrators should be arrested immediately; (3) Compensation for damages and medical expenses; (4) The anti-Japanese movement should be suppressed by appropriate means; (5) All organizations that encourage hostility towards Japan, incite riots, and encourage anti-Japanese activities should be disbanded.</p>
<p>On the morning of January 21st, the Mayor of Shanghai replied to the Japanese Consul General that the first three demands were being considered, but the other demands could not be satisfied due to difficulties. The Japanese Naval Commander immediately published a document to the newspapers, stating that if the Mayor of Shanghai did not give the Japanese a satisfactory reply and immediately implement the demands, the Naval Commander would take appropriate measures to protect the rights and interests of the Japanese Empire. This publication was also copied to the Public Concession authorities and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau.</p>
<p>On January 24th, Japanese naval reinforcements arrived outside Wusongkou. At the same time, rumors spread that Chinese troops in Zhabei had also been reinforced. On that day, the Japanese Consul General notified the Mayor of Shanghai that if he did not receive a reply within a reasonable period of time, or if the reply was not satisfactory, the Japanese government reserved the right to take necessary action as the situation warranted. At that time, the Mayor of Shanghai had stated to the representatives of the neutral countries that he was prepared to make the greatest concessions to avoid conflict, and worked hard to persuade local leaders to abolish the Anti-Japanese Boycott Association. Also, because the Japanese considered the words "Anti-Japanese" to be insulting to the Japanese nation, he also planned to delete the words "Anti-Japanese" from the names of other organizations. As a result, the Anti-Japanese Boycott Association was sealed off, and all of its offices were sealed one by one by the Chinese police on the night of January 27th to 28th.</p>
<p>On January 25th, the Japanese Consul General informed the Mayor of Shanghai that although he did not specify a time limit, he wanted to receive a general outline of the reply by the 28th.</p>
<p>On January 27th, the Japanese Consul General notified the Mayor of Shanghai that he should receive a satisfactory reply to his demands by 6 p.m. the next afternoon, otherwise the Japanese would take the measures they deemed necessary to realize their demands.</p>
<p>At 7:30 a.m. on January 28th, the Japanese Naval Commander notified the defense commanders of other countries that if there was no satisfactory reply from the Chinese side, he would take action the next morning. The Municipal Council then held a meeting and decided to declare the concession in a state of emergency from 4 p.m. This action was taken by the Municipal Council on its own initiative, and was tantamount to informing the generals of various countries to prepare to defend their respective territories. Early in the afternoon of the same day, Mayor Shang replied to the Japanese Consul General, fully acknowledging his demands. At 4 p.m., the Japanese Consul General informed the Consular Corps that he had received a reply, and stated that the reply was completely satisfactory. He also stated that he would have to see if the Mayor of Shanghai could implement what he had acknowledged, but also said that most of the demands had been implemented and that he would not take any further action for the time being. Although there was this change in the diplomatic situation, the hearts of the people believed that the Japanese naval authorities had decided to take action no matter what. The inflammatory news issued by the Japanese Press Association said that China had no intention of implementing its promises, and that Chinese people were preparing to attack the Japanese. It also predicted that the Chinese side would revolt because they opposed the mayor's acknowledgement of the demands. Because of the above, the Defense Committee of various countries believed that it was best to implement the emergency announcement. Therefore, martial law was implemented at 4 p.m. It should be pointed out that the defense committee of the Public Concession is composed of the defense commanders of various countries.</p>

<h3>Receiving Important Telegrams from Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>The Chief of the Police Department and the Commander of the Volunteer Corps, with the Chief of Defence being the Chairman, does not have the right to instruct as to the details of how the various defence forces of the different countries should operate in their areas; he is only in charge of assigning territories, coordinating the overall plan for defence arrangements. After the declaration of martial law, British and American forces each went to their respective stations. Italian troops arrived in their defence zone on the 29th. The Japanese zone was the entire northeastern part of the Concession, bordered on the west by North Henan Road, which from the perspective of the Defence Committee, also included a section outside the Concession, bordered on the west by North Jiangxi Road and the Wusong Railway, and on the north by the north side of Hongkou Park, its eastern section formed a line, most of which was the northeast corner of Hongkou Park, connected to the Harbin police station. Many Japanese lived in the Hongkou Park area. Although the park and North Sichuan Road (Dixwell Road) are outside the Concession, they are the property of the Concession, and are usually patrolled by the Municipal Council. Before the incident that occurred at 11:00 p.m., it appeared that the Chinese authorities had not received any notification regarding the Japanese sector outside the border. When martial law was first implemented, Japanese troops were not stationed in the sector outside the border either. However, Japanese sailors used to station troops in the section above the Municipal Council Road to protect their residents, and their naval headquarters were also located at the end of that section.</p>
<p>At 11 p.m. that evening, the Japanese Naval Commander issued two announcements and sent copies to the Mayor of Shanghai. The Mayor said that he received them at 11:25 p.m. One of the announcements mentioned martial law, and said that the Japanese Navy was extremely concerned about the situation in Zhabei, where there were many Japanese residents, and had decided to send troops to that section to enforce law and order. Therefore, it was hoped that the Chinese authorities would quickly withdraw the troops stationed in Zhabei to the west of the railway and remove the defenses there. The other announcement said that the Japanese soldiers who were sent to protect the order of the Concession would fulfill all matters related to the implementation of martial law. Japanese sailors and armed civilians, who had been gathered at the Marine Corps Headquarters, advanced along North Sichuan Road, heading west towards Bazilu, until they reached North Henan Road. Along the way, teams were assigned at the entrances of the alleys. At midnight, when the signal was given, the assigned teams moved northwest. The last team towards the railway, about one hundred sailors, drove an armored car and tried to cross the gate at the bottom of North Henan Road, but were stopped by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, because the gate was in the area guarded by the Chamber. This gate led to the railway. The Chinese army initially did not comply with the Japanese Naval Commander's request to withdraw troops, and even if it decided to withdraw, it could not withdraw the Chinese troops in that section within a short period of time. The situation that had been brewing for the past few days also had to be taken into account, because it would make the Chinese authorities see the measures taken by the Japanese Naval Authorities as part of their larger military action. Japanese sailors subsequently encountered resistance from the regular Chinese army. Japanese troops advanced to Baoshan Road south of the railway line, but were unable to reach the south of that point.</p>
<p>The route was east of the railway, along the boundary of North Henan Road and North Sichuan Road. The Japanese army was injured by a Chinese freight train, which departed from the station and patrolled the Wusong Railway, and later took refuge in the East Yard. The road was heavily defended by the Chinese army. Therefore, on January 29th, the Japanese army dropped bombs at the station and used aircraft to destroy the railway and other buildings on Baoshan Road, which were also set on fire with incendiary bombs. It is generally believed that this was done deliberately to eliminate strongholds that could spy on the Japanese front lines. Although casualties are unknown, the loss of life must have been considerable. The Mayor of Shanghai protested to the Consular Corps because of the Japanese army's actions. Japan said that this action was unrelated to the demands that had been made. The demands had already been acknowledged, so this was done to protect the Japanese in the area they wanted to occupy. The Japanese authorities also claimed that the actions they took met with Chinese armed resistance, and that the Japanese authorities assumed full responsibility for them. They were within the boundaries they had set, and were permitted by the Concession defense plan if necessary. On the 29th, the large-scale military action progressed without ceasing. In the afternoon of the 29th, at the request of the Mayor of Shanghai, the British and American Consuls General tried to create a temporary truce, starting at 9 p.m. This temporary truce was only a mutual agreement not to fire guns and cannons again.</p>
<p>On January 31st, the Japanese Consul General, the Japanese Naval Commander, the Mayor of Shanghai, and the Chinese local Commander met in the rooms of the British and American Consuls General to discuss a method that should be proposed by the Japanese Consul General to his government to withdraw Japanese troops from that front. If the Japanese government replied in the negative, then the Chinese side would also report to the Chinese government. Before receiving a final reply, both sides agreed not to fire on their own unless the other side fired first. Session Chairman Xue Yaboge signed (Italian Consul General).</p>
<p>London: Today's meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council was held at the request of Dr. Yen Hui-ching, the chief Chinese representative, to discuss the Shanghai Consular Committee's report. The general public is anxiously awaiting the results of the meeting. The Manchester Guardian today commented on the report, saying that it did not add much to what was already known, and contained the usual excuses of Japanese diplomats for the arbitrary actions of their army and navy. The newspaper expressed the opinion that the more important thing today is to see what can be done with this report (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) A passage in the report submitted by the Shanghai Consular Investigation Team to the League of Nations was noted by the press of various countries here and was specially commented on. The text reads: On the night of January 28th to 29th, about two hundred Japanese sailors tried to pass through the iron gate of the Public Concession at the end of North Henan Road with an armored car to go to the North Railway Station in the Chinese territory, but were blocked by the International Chamber of Commerce. The press of various countries here considers that although the indication of this passage of the report to the League of Nations is very subtle, it is very clear. Its meaning is that the actions taken by Japan on the night of January 28th to 29th were not entirely due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Public Concession. This kind of action should not be regarded as the common defense of the Public Concession (Havas, 9th).</p>
<h3>British and American Authorities Consult on Shanghai Incident Across the Ocean</h3>
<p>Wait for New Developments in the Situation</p>
<p>Then Take Further Action</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson spoke by transatlantic telephone with British Foreign Secretary Simon, who is currently in Geneva, yesterday, and it was heard that they were discussing the Shanghai incident. According to reliable sources, after exchanging views, they have agreed that the British and American governments will not make peace proposals on the Sino-Japanese dispute for the time being, and will take the second step when new developments in the situation suggest that Japan may accept the proposed plan (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>The United States Opposes the Proposal for a Demilitarized Zone</h3>
<p>Claiming that it Violates the Principles of the Washington Treaty</p>
<p>(Washington) A proposal was received from Tokyo advocating the removal of military facilities from Chinese commercial ports, making each a neutral zone. It is heard that the US government will reject this plan. According to comments from people in the State Department, this Japanese proposal violates the spirit of the US's China policy, because its nature is equivalent to partitioning China and undermining the open-door policy. The State Department has not yet received a formal proposal from Japan or other countries. It is expected that after the US clearly expresses its attitude, the Japanese government will not formally propose this plan again. Officials here have been commenting on the proposal since seeing the statement made by the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the newspapers. Although Secretary of State Stimson is not yet willing to express his opinion, other officials in the State Department have informally declared that the US government has no room for considering such plans. The United States will adhere to the principles agreed upon at the Washington Conference: (1) Non-interference in China's internal affairs, (2) The countries concerned should do their best to assist China in improving its politics, while at the same time respecting its sovereignty and territorial integrity (National Telegram, 8th).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the Japanese proposal to establish demilitarized zones in China has caused some misunderstanding. In fact, this proposal does not need to be revised or replace the Nine-Power Treaty, but can be used to supplement the Nine-Power Treaty. This proposal not only does not split China, but if implemented, can greatly reduce the danger of splitting. The fundamental idea of this proposal is to break the power of Chinese warlords and facilitate the establishment of a stable government. The world should now know that the role of the Chinese army is different from that of Western countries. The Chinese army is useless for national defense, but is merely a tool for warlords in domestic political competition. The United States has criticized this Japanese proposal, but if the United States does not welcome this proposal, it may as well propose another solution, because in order to restore China's stability, it is necessary to take some action. The spokesman also said that Japan's plan may be tried in Shanghai first, and if it is satisfactory, it can be promoted elsewhere (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Raises Public Debt to Pay for War Expenses</h3>
<p>Totaling 34 Million Yuan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Cabinet has decided to ask the Privy Council to approve the promulgation of an order to issue bonds totaling 34 million Japanese yen to cover the military expenses in Shanghai. According to yesterday's news, the Cabinet planned to raise a debt of 40 million yen (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Proposes Impeachment of the Government</h3>
<p>Raises Questions on the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>(London) Opposition leader Lansbury proposed a motion to impeach the government in the House of Commons today, accusing the government of lacking a consistent policy, undermining the principles of responsible cabinet government, failing to support the poor people at home, and causing a terrorist situation in India. Baldwin spoke to defend the government, saying that the government had adopted new methods to deal with new developments in new situations, and that the government's actions were approved by people with common sense. Radical Labour Party member Maxton said that the government had abandoned the old principles of responsible cabinet government, and that he congratulated the government, but he could not forgive the government for failing to relieve poverty and causing a terrorist situation in India. The House of Commons finally rejected the impeachment motion against the government by a vote of 438 to 39 (Reuters, 8th).</p>
<p>(London) Undersecretary of State for War Eden declared in the House of Commons that he knew nothing about the organization of an independent state in Manchuria except for a note from the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations on December 16 of last year, which quoted Hondo Shigeru's remarks. Therefore, the negotiation with Japan has not yet become a problem. Also, Baldwin replied to a question from opposition Labour Party leader Lansbury, saying that negotiations are currently underway to try to stop the hostilities in Shanghai, and that he could not say more. Indian Minister Hoare declared that as of now, the Indian garrison had not yet been sent to Shanghai, but there may be changes in the troop relocation arrangements, so a battalion of Indian troops may be sent to Shanghai several weeks earlier than originally planned (Havas, 8th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Ministry Restrains Soldiers' Atrocities</h3>
<p>Avoid Conflicts with British and American Troops</p>
<p>The Tokyo Navy Ministry announced that it had ordered the Japanese commander stationed in Shanghai to ensure that his subordinates would avoid any possible conflicts with British, American and other countries' soldiers stationed in Shanghai, maintain friendly relations with foreign troops, and pay close attention to Chinese and foreign civilians, especially women and children (Reuters, 12th).</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Finance Minister Inoue Suddenly Assassinated</h3>
<p>Shot Three Times, One Through the Chest, Assailant Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>Motive of Assassination Unknown</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Former Finance Minister Inoue went to a school at 8 p.m. tonight to give an election campaign speech for a candidate from the Minseito party. When he arrived in front of the school, just after getting out of the car, a young man suddenly stepped forward and fired three shots at him, two hitting his body and one piercing his chest. He was rushed to the hospital, but died before he could be treated. The crowd immediately gathered and arrested the assailant and handed him over to the police. However, in the confusion, the assailant's accomplice escaped with a handgun. The motive for the assassination is unknown. However, someone threw a bomb at Inoue's house on May 3 of last year, and before the resignation of the Wakatsuki Cabinet in December of last year, there were repeated rumors that the lives of Inoue and Shidehara were in danger. This was because when Inoue was Finance Minister, he was heavily criticized for relaxing the gold embargo and resolutely opposing the restoration of the embargo. Inoue was sixty-two years old, and after graduating from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University, he served in the Bank of Japan. Later, he was promoted to the head of the business department of the bank, then the president of the Yokohama Specie Bank, and in 1927 he became the president of the Bank of Japan for the third time, and had served three times as the Minister of Finance (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>Luo Wengan Issues Important Statement</h3>
<p>Denouncing the Absurd Proposal of the Japanese Naval Minister</p>
<p>China is No Longer the China of 1901</p>
<p>Cannot Sign Treaties That Are Outdated</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan said that Japanese Naval Minister Osumi recently advocated that Shanghai should follow the precedent of Tianjin and have an international agreement that China could not station troops within a certain number of miles to eliminate future disputes. The Japanese diplomatic authorities also proposed that China should not station troops within 15 to 20 miles around the five ports of Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Qingdao, and that China should not station troops in the three northeastern provinces, or only station a small number of troops to perform police duties. Shanghai is an important port for peaceful commerce between China and foreign countries. For decades, China and foreign countries have been able to live in peace, and Shanghai's development today is proof of this. The current incident was purely caused by Japanese soldiers using the concession to attack Chinese troops, and Japan should bear the responsibility for it. Chinese troops guarding Chinese territory is the most legitimate and legal act, and there is no reason for China to abandon its right to survival and self-defense within its territory because of the Japanese military action of violating treaties and unreasonably invading. This is actually destroying the integrity of China's administrative power, which has been guaranteed by international treaties many times. As for the peace zone, it is purely a temporary arrangement to isolate the conflict between the two armies, and it will be cancelled immediately after the event. If Japan gains another military base in Shanghai on the surface for trade, controlling the transportation between Beijing and Shanghai, then Shanghai will no longer be safe in the future. This not only hinders the business of various countries and all their interests in China, but also becomes a major flashpoint for destroying peace in the Far East. This point should be clearly recognized by the governments and people of various countries. As for the rumors that the Japanese diplomatic community has said that China should not station troops within 15 to 20 miles around the five ports of Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Qingdao, and that the three northeastern provinces should not station troops or only station a small number of troops to perform police duties, this is even more appalling. It is still unacceptable in a corner of Shanghai, and the reasons are as stated above, let alone other ports and the three northeastern provinces. This is directly depriving China of all its rights of survival and self-defense, and all the rights and protections that an independent country should enjoy under the law, and allowing the country closest to it in terms of geography, most convenient for aggression to dominate. No defeated country in the world can sign this harsh and suicidal condition. Moreover, China has not declared war on any country, and there are repeated resolutions of the League of Nations guaranteeing the issue of the three northeastern provinces, proving where the truth and justice lie. In short, Japan has violated the Non-Aggression Pact, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and has no excuse to invade Chinese territory by force. It is trying to use international interests to stir up various countries, but it does not know that its intentions and results are completely contrary to international interests. I firmly believe that justice still exists in the international community, and that all friendly countries will be able to recognize the right and wrong, the advantages and disadvantages, and their treaty responsibilities, and will not be swayed by this propaganda action with ulterior motives that is contrary to the facts. As for the stability of the Chinese government, it is a matter of China's internal affairs, and the Chinese people can decide for themselves. As for the so-called Chinese merchants welcome this claim, I know that patriotic merchants will be filled with righteous indignation when they hear it. The Japanese diplomatic authorities have even called this claim a moral plan. I do not know whether there is such a moral example in the international community of the strong bullying the weak and falsely accusing the weak of infringing on the strong, and not allowing them to have a guarantee of survival. I want the world to recognize that today's China is no longer the China of 1901. The national government cannot sign a treaty that is thirty-one years out of date. This is what I dare to declare responsibly (Special Dispatch, 8th).</p>
<h3>American Envoy Visits Luo Wengan</h3>
<p>Exchanging Opinions on the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>(Nanjing) American Ambassador Johnson, accompanied by his secretary, visited Foreign Minister Luo Wengan at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3 PM on the 9th. They briefly exchanged opinions regarding a new mediation method to be proposed by various countries concerning the Sino-Japanese incident. Shi Zhaoji, our envoy to England, and Rong Kui, our acting representative to the United States, are also currently in contact with the governments of their respective host countries. Telegrams have been arriving in Beijing daily, reporting on the progress of these contacts. It is said that a certain envoy stationed abroad suggested to the government that the United States convene a conference of countries signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Reportedly, while the British government is unwilling to initiate such a conference, it would be willing to be the first to support it. However, our diplomatic authorities believe that the mediation proposals made by various countries stem from the goodwill of friendly nations who cherish peace, and we do not wish to propose our own methods.

<h3>International Women's League Supports Peace Declaration</h3>
<p>Endorsing the Application of Economic Pressure on Japan</p>

This declaration has already been made public. Its content states, "We believe that all countries that signed the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty should declare illegal any commitments obtained in a manner that violates the obligations of the aforementioned treaties. We also request that the Council take decisive action and explicitly prohibit the import of military supplies to both belligerent nations, while applying diplomatic and economic pressure on Japan so that hostile acts may be stopped immediately," etc. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>First Memorial Week Since the National Government Moved to Luoyang</h3>
<p>Li Liejun Reports on the Current Situation</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Today, the National Government held its first Memorial Week in Luoyang. Li Liejun reported on the current affairs, stating that the government, after several days of deliberation, has decided on a concrete plan to deal with the political situation. Li first described the significance of Luoyang, saying that it is located in the center and is the birthplace of Chinese culture. Therefore, establishing the capital here has various advantages, not only at this juncture. In recent months, Japan has occupied our Northeast provinces, attacked our Tianjin, and now is recklessly slaughtering our innocent civilians in Shanghai from the sky and destroying a huge amount of property. Although China has lodged a serious protest, it has been ignored, and the powers' warnings have not been heeded, nor have the various treaties safeguarding world peace been respected. World public opinion is now unanimously against Japan. When Japan first invaded the Northeast provinces, Chinese public opinion was divided into two factions, but now they have merged into one, determined to resist aggression. Our army is now vowing to defend Shanghai to the death. Shanghai is an international market, and the powers are deeply concerned about Shanghai's security. They have put forward peaceful suggestions. If Japan repents, it should immediately cease hostilities and withdraw its troops; otherwise, our army is determined to drive them out. There are only two ways to resolve the current dispute: diplomacy and force. Although the powers will eventually uphold justice, China is determined to persevere to the end. It hopes that the people will cooperate with the government to achieve success, etc. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang City is Calm</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Has Not Yet Moved to Yangzhou</p>
<p>However, Financial Institutions Have Been Suspended</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: On the day following the Shanghai incident, train tickets from Zhenjiang only went as far as Suzhou, and traffic to Shanghai was interrupted immediately. Troops of a certain unit successively departed for the front. More than a thousand people from all circles in Zhenjiang presented flags and sent them off at the station, shouting slogans. The sound was close, and the morale of the soldiers was even more courageous. Zhenjiang banks experienced a slight run three days ago. The provincial government and the Chamber of Commerce held a meeting to discuss relief measures. Because it was inconvenient to transfer funds from Shanghai, all bank notes were temporarily not redeemed. The market remained in common use as usual. In the past two days, it has been fairly stable. However, small shops refuse to give change in single notes or silver dollars for five-yuan notes. Uninformed people even lower prices. If a method for redeeming them is not devised, it may be difficult to maintain the original price in the long run. Copper coins are only exchanged for 2,400 cash per yuan. Banks closed their doors on the second day because all the banks in Shanghai had closed. Today (the fourth day), all the money shops also closed one after another. Government work is as usual. There was initially a rumor that they were moving to Jurong, but the government denied it. However, yesterday (the third day), important documents were sent to the Yangzhou Provincial Middle School for safekeeping, indicating that even if the Japanese came to Zhenjiang to cause trouble, they would swear to resist. There are two or three Japanese gunboats on the river that come and go from time to time. It is reported that two of them are active on the Longtan River. The defense on both the north and south banks of the Yangtze River is extremely strict. There were originally only fifteen Japanese nationals in Zhenjiang, including those from the Nisshin Trading Company, the Sui Sheng Match Factory, and the Japanese Hospital, who all boarded the Dashi gunboat at the end of last month. This ship is a small, stream-type gunboat. Recently, because the Xin Jiangsu Bao published the Korean Independence Party's declaration, the captain went to the provincial government to ask Chairman Gu and the newspaper's editor to apologize, but it was refused. Yesterday, the Japanese consul also sent a secretary to the Public Security Bureau stating that the Japanese warship was in Zhenjiang entirely for the purpose of protecting Japanese nationals, and requested that a notice be issued to reassure the citizens. The Public Security Bureau replied that there was no panic in Zhenjiang and that there was no need to issue a notice. Since the shelling occurred in Nanjing, tens of thousands of people have come to Zhenjiang from Xiaguan every day, mostly crossing the river to Yangzhou and downstream. Small steamers and cars have added several shifts every day, but they are still very crowded. The Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice extending the accounting period by one month. Local people have formed another committee to maintain the market, and if necessary, they plan to form a Red Swastika Society rescue team and shelters, etc. Members of the business corps are all on duty every night. The land army's defense works on the riverbank are also very well equipped. (4th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Deploys Border Defenses to Aid Shanghai</h3>
<p>Air Force Transfers Half of its Military Aircraft to Shanghai to Assist in Combat</p>
<p>The Navy, Army, and Air Force Unite Against Japan, Fully Armed and Prepared</p>
<p>Guangzhou Special Dispatch: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the people of the Baiyue region have been filled with grief and indignation. The military authorities have also unanimously decided to jointly face the national crisis. Telegrams to the central government and to aid the 19th Route Army from all the navy, army, and air force generals were telegraphed on the evening of the 29th. At 10:00 AM on the 30th, Chen Jitang convened a national defense conference with the generals of the First Army Group. The army commanders, division commanders, chief officers, and the Air Force commander-in-chief also attended. Concrete measures were planned regarding consolidating the Southwest border defense and assisting the frontline soldiers. Due to military secrets, they will not be released for the time being. However, Guangdong Province is an important gateway to South China and must be defended in advance. Because Japanese warships in Shantou fired indiscriminately at pedestrians on the shore for no reason on the 29th, in addition to ordering the 2nd Independent Division of Zhang Ruigui to send troops to strictly guard the coastal defense along the mountains, Humen in Guangzhou should also be properly deployed. Therefore, Chen Jitang personally went to Humen on the 31st to inspect the defenses there, addressing the Humen Garrison Guard Brigade of Chen Hanguang and the 4th Division of Zhang Da, and inspected the fortresses. At the same time, he instructed Zhang Da, the commander of the Humen Fortress, on the necessary measures. Chen returned the day after the inspection and yesterday allocated five anti-aircraft guns, along with a large number of shells and a large batch of temporary combat defense supplies, which were transported by boat to Humen for use. He also ordered the commander to repair the fortresses and increase the number of gun emplacements, declaring martial law when necessary and prohibiting foreign ships from entering or leaving. The officers of the garrisoned troops at each fortress are not allowed to leave their posts. The 1st Fleet of the Navy has also been concentrating its fleet and patrolling the sea every day and has also increased the number of Marine Corps by one regiment. On the Air Force side, a full air force meeting was held on the evening of the 29th. More than 100 pilots and mechanics above the rank of major attended, all believing that in this time of national crisis, the entire Guangdong Air Force should go north to aid the 19th Route Army. The following measures were immediately discussed and decided: (1) The entire Air Force is prepared to mobilize to Shanghai at any time. (2) A dance party will be held at the Aviation Club on the 30th as a final farewell, demonstrating their determination to save the country at all costs. (3) Three Yangcheng aircrafts will be built within three days, awaiting orders to move to Shanghai for assistance. It is also heard that the Air Force Headquarters has received a telegram from Chen Mingshu in Shanghai, reporting the start of the Shanghai war and requesting the transfer of half of the Guangdong military aircraft to Shanghai for assistance. The Headquarters has replied in agreement. The aircraft will go north in the coming days. On the 30th, all the generals of the Air Force sent a special telegram to the Air Force comrades in Nanjing, stating, "Having just received a telegram from Shanghai, we know that the Japanese are advancing step by step and even invading our upper reaches, Shanghai, which is so violent that it is truly unbearable. It is heard that the 19th Route Army has launched a just resistance, showing solidarity and unity. Please send aircraft to Shanghai as soon as possible to assist in combat. The comrades here have prepared everything to be the backup for all of you," etc. As for the Army, after the National Defense Conference on the 30th, Chen Jitang, in the name of the commander-in-chief of the 1st Army Group, ordered the generals of the 1st and 3rd Armies to return to their defense as soon as possible to preside over military affairs, and also telegraphed the Southwest provinces, requesting them to send personnel to Guangdong as soon as possible to discuss the Southwest's national defense. Liaison and ordered the troops in various provinces to pay attention to consolidating the borders. After receiving the order, Guangdong generals Yu Hanmou and Li Yangjing returned to the defense of Beijiang and Dongjiang on the 30th. The military authorities also believe that the 19th Route Army is currently fighting alone, and the rear should provide a steady stream of supplies. On the 30th, 400,000 yuan was first remitted from Guangdong to Shanghai to assist the military expenses of the 19th Route Army, and it was determined that supplies will be provided steadily thereafter.</p>
