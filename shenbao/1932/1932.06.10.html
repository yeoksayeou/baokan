<h3 id="c1">政治上之奬罰彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>七日行政院開第三十九次會議以山東省主席韓復築辦理禁烟成績最優。决議呈請國府明令嘉奬在奬罰久已不明之今日。吾人聆此。誠不啻空谷足音。耳目爲之一新然而吾人仍有未能已於言者在。</p>
<p>近歲以來。軍人各各擁兵自雄。分崩離析。政府綱紀不振。罰固無論。奬亦不行軍人恃其兵力。爲所欲爲。政府亦惟有故作痴聾。置不聞問民困水火。無可訴語。亦已久矣。</p>
<p>即以禁烟而言。中央禁烟之命令。固煌煌昭示。舉國共仰也。雖切實奉行如山東浙江諸省。劃除烟苗嚴禁販吸。雷厲風行。行成績昭著者。固自不少。然而各地軍人之勒種。勒銷。包運。公然爲之。毫無忌憚。亦爲習見習聞之事初未見政府曾予以懲處也又如喪心病狂之徒。藉口寓禁於徵再主張鴉片公賣且有多省暗中旣已實行。殘民禍國。莫逾於此亦未見政府曾予以申斥懲戒也如認魯省之禁烟爲可嘉。則他省之勒種勒銷及主持公賣者當爲有罪。禁烟者應奬。則勒種勒銷者應罰。有奬而無罰。即爲奬罰不明。其將何以立紀綱而維政府之威信。</p>
<p>由於政治上之奬罰不行。是非不明。故國家法紀蕩然。官多貪汚。政治紊亂。即如近數年來監院委員曾一再彈劾大員。然而結果迄無回響。故監察院監察之成績。除彈劾數縣長而外。他無可言。由是可徵國家之法令。適爲强者壓迫弱者之武器。適徒以桎結平民。但有權勢。法律即無所施。于右任氏去年曾有「槍桿彈劾」之憤語固亦慨乎言之矣。</p>
<p>吾人認爲我國目前欲樹立統一而有力之中樞。必明奬罰。正是非。負政治之重責者。尤應正己以正人。立己以立人國家功令。絶不容絲毫遷讓。尤不容畏憚大力。委曲求全。夫然後可以立紀綱。正視聽。建樹政府之威信。今日以禁烟爲是。則勒種勒銷者皆爲非是。若獎一禁烟者。而對多數勒種勒種勒銷者優容姑息。不加聞問母乃過於滑稽。是故當局而欲莫心禁烟。眞心整飭吏治當必有進一步之表示也。</p>

<p>不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>我們聽見朱先生這番話是五體投地的欽佩。宋老太，春生哥和我異口同聲的說：『朱先生這種主張一點也不錯。』我補了一句說：『就請朱先生到我們村莊裏去把這些主張行出來吧。』宋老太，春生哥也毫不遲疑的表示贊同。朱先生聽見我們三個人一致歡迎他下鄉，便站起來說：『我對於鄉下的事是一竅也不通，但是願意跟大家學，如果諸位願意隨時敎我，我馬上就下鄉去做諸位的學生。我還有一個弟弟，他要帶去拜諸位做先生。』宋老太說：先生是說反話吧？我們請得先生下鄉，大家都可以向您請敎，</p>
<p>那是多麽的幸福啊！先生總是先生，我們能做您的學生，已經是天大的福氣。於今先生還說要拜我們做先生，那是折然我們了。』春生哥也說：朱先生的話我們是不敢當。總之我們今天陪先生一起下鄉，那是樂幸極了。』朱先生說：『不是客氣。將來您們看吧！我能敎您們的很少、您們能敎我的很多』我想起敲鐘的事急於要下鄉，便說：『大家都不要客氣了。我們一起下鄉吃午飯。朱先生！請您就去把小弟弟帶來，我們在這兒候駕，好不好？』朱先生說了一聲：』好！』就去了。</p>
<p>宋老太與春生哥在那兒談話，口口聲聲稱贊朱先生。我是一個子在這兒獃想。宋老太大概是忘了吧？她最反對的是毛毛雨，妹妹我愛你。她已經提議不請提倡這種歌曲的先生。她能擔保朱先生不到鄉下去幹這個把戲嗎？她何以把這個重要的條件忽略掉？朱先生對於這一點抱了什麽態度？她是一句話也没有問！我呢？那是格外無以自解了。我曾經下了决心，凡是不能說明電燈如何發光和大世界鏡子裏如何有這麽多的變化的人，我都不願請他？做先生。何以見了朱生一句也不提？忘了嗎？鄉下老見了城裏人就怕問嗎奇怪！這一切的一切是不消問了。朱先生所提出的主張是出乎我們意料之外的偉大，把我們這些小問題都一網打盡的包羅在内。我之所以不急於追問那電燈和鏡子裏的奥妙，是因爲朱先生明明的告訴我，他『祇做活學問，越做越不足。』他若是知道這裏面的奥妙，那麽等他下鄉後再請敎也不遲：他若是不知道吧，他日後會把牠們當作活學問去研究，總有一天把這奥妙的道理找出來。我如何可以憑着這一兩點零碎的智識而定一位先生之去留呢？宋老太的顧慮怕是和我的一樣，同被朱先生的主張打得粉</p>
<p>粉碎碎，飛到九霄雲外去了吧？</p>
<p>分量斟酌减經、材料内容亦應就年級程度、分别深淺難易因勢利導、即低年級與糼稚團兒童各種游戲活動、亦應酌加雪恥救國材料、以資陶冶、各級訓綀務須本此意旨、切實施行、尤須持久不懈、始終如一、振衰起廢、端賴乎此、</p>

<p>市塲概况　連日因釐市慈勢不振、市而頽唐、故雖有一度轉俏、而卒仍落、甚至相循墜下、</p>
<p>不可挽救、觀節前後之形勢、似已瞭然胸、就目前大勢、宜其無轉機之期、不果久久下墜、總非金融及各商業之幸、銀根前途、亦抱鬆和之象、近復無能爲濟、良可嘅已、</p>
<p>釐拆價格　「洋釐」晨市釐價較節前（即七日）改好七毫半、爲六錢九分四釐七毫半、午市依舊下跌七毫半、仍與節前相同、爲六錢九分四釐、「銀拆」早午兩市俱開二分、較節前似好些微、而劃頭白劃銀根鬆濫、依然如恒、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋、就最近數日中以市面上各價俱小、乃隨之跌小、昨又跌去二釐、爲五錢九分七釐、早午市均同、交易祇早市五千角、廣東小洋、早市爲五錢九分三釐、午市爲五錢九分二釐七毫半、交易早市十六萬五千角、午市三萬角、鋼元站定、未有更動、仍爲四百二十五千五百文、</p>

<p>今年洋釐價格遞跌、迄於目前、似屬最小、超過二十年前（七錢零五釐一毫半）最低價、亦有一分以上、此項跌勢、苟無特殊背景、斷不致有如此之甚、雖日來現底充斥、查遜清光緒三十一年份、六七月間、現洋存底、曾超過二萬萬以上、（按從前滬埠市面、不若目前繁華、大概須以四與一之比例）若然如目前繁榮市面、即有五六萬萬以上之現底、亦不爲過、特以當初鈔票、無現在之多耳、茲偵悉個中厘跌内幕之背景、據傳聞所得、謂有人欲倡議廢兩運動、（廢兩易元、早有成議、惟未實行）、但就目下大勢推測、恐此倡議、殆有試行之必妥、否則厘跌漫無限止、社會生活需求上之暗耗、更將不貲也、確否雖不敢必、姑俟將來待證、</p>

<p>開時欣欣向榮　自早七月份、開盤即加三兩二錢、爲七百二十三兩八錢、蓋前昨兩天大條共升八分之一至十六分之一、惟銀價反小八分之一、私電亦然故人心即好、恒餘内興首先而進、次爲二十四兩半、惟萬興順利等出售、又以美金初似硬勢、住友買十月八一一五至七五、即行貶落二兩、爲二十二兩六錢、俄而銀行互做九月三七五、又買八月英金一八·一八七五、且由大德成恒興鴻康永同太昌恒餘丙興福餘天豐永等等前來爭進、又以某銀行開進現貨二百十條、人心更佳、遂漲三兩餘、九點三十分爲二十五兩半、滙豐掛牌英平美縮一二五、乃滙兌軋小關係、時由二十五兩加至二十六兩、内盤益緊、入後大連帮及乾昌祥志豐永義豐永福興永恒餘等脫手、並以匯豐等出來八月美金三十一元一二五、七月三十元八七五、九月份三七五可結、以致退却三兩餘、十點二十分爲二十二兩二錢、惟九點半後至十點一刻僅計數錢、至多一兩上下、十點半始又見好、七月美金對做九三七五、十月五六二五、大德成丙興等買進、某銀行續吃現貨一百四十條、遂增二兩、將近十一點時爲二十四兩一錢、瞬跌二兩餘、洵以大連帮賣出甚勤、元茂永源泰恒餘亦出、僅隔十分鐘降爲二十一兩四錢、繼則抬上二兩、一般空方補進、十一點半爲二十三兩錢、大連帮又出、减一兩餘、十一點五十分爲二十一兩六錢、旋由二十二兩三錢收盤、揭價改爲七百九十三兩、計撤七十</p>

<p>午後安穏之態　後市開盤二十一兩七錢、次爲一兩六錢、順利鴻康永售出、嗣甚和平、微漲三四錢直至二點三十分始見抬上二兩餘、因大德成萬興義豐永物品套頭等買進、並以三井吸本月美金三十元八一二五、十月五六二五、而近期結者不絶、計七月八七五、過三點零二十四兩半、恒興福餘志豐永出售、尤以上海出九月四三七五、三井進十月須爲六二五、乃價遜落兩許、三點四十分左右爲二十三兩六錢恒餘等買進、傳聞某銀行又開現貨之說、滙豐吸十月美金五六二五、三點五十餘分爲二十四兩四錢、無奈恒興福餘賣出、致價未能上透、四點十分回至二十三兩五錢、頃刻轉挺、大德成恒餘同福志豐永以及物品買氣熾、乃一跳一兩六七錢、爲二十五兩二錢、時略捧四五錢、迨四點三十分收市爲二十四兩九錢、比七月計漲四兩三錢、（已迭漲三天幾將十兩）收後因賣者似多、重計二十四兩零、故物品抑小六錢、按全日最大二十六兩、最小二十一兩四錢、相差四兩六錢、揭價計撳七十二兩至六十八九兩、登賬二十二兩、補水二十二兩、下午二十五兩、赤條計加八</p>

<p>昨日銀市英升美平、滙兌稍見回大、惟前日報跌、統核軋小一分有餘、至於滙豐掛牌英金未更、美金縮一二五、爲卅元零二五、印匯加二五、德滙則小去七五、法即降二元、餘無更動、殆内盤英平美堅、由於匯兌趨小之故、惟終日無甚變幻、而金市一再抬高四兩餘、實乃現貨走勢活動、</p>
<p>存底尤枯、迨結果比較七日、計英金扯平、美金近期亦無榮辱、遠期則縮一二五、華商交易尙勤、計英金不過數萬鎊、稍有抽出、又美金成交七八十萬元、各金號抛出十月而扒結七八月、滙豐</p>

<p>五千、統稅五十二萬元外、其他僅在二十萬元左右、七月份期貨交易寥落如故、至言各債劵價之趨勢、以時局靜定、徵象無新發展、加之漸屆金融結束之期、人心觀望、大声進出甚微、債價盤</p>

<p>據最近棉業某君、曾於前月間赴滿洲山東天津等處、調查棉業情形、分述如下</p>
<p>滿洲　最近一月以來、由日本内地經安東所進口之花色布、存量山積、約計一萬包、遂使上海方面之貨品、受其壓迫、無大批交易、加之美棉及銀塊下落、上海向滿銷路益感不振、又在滿鐵沿線各地之上海紗、各有少量存貨</p>
<p>天津　該處所存上海紗布尙少、頗有相當銷路惟最近雨量太少、農産物前途頗覺憂慮、行家方面不願賒貨、故銷路有减退傾問、尤以上海製品爲然</p>
<p>靑島　該處頗有需要、惟近來上海日廠開工恐市價將跌、買方竟存觀望、而賣方急於脫售、市價貶跌、仍無顧客、該處亦與滿洲天津相同、日本來貨甚多、上海貨頗受壓迫、目下銷路無望、靑島日廠所售出製品棉布至九月份、棉紗至六月份、棉紗銷路較棉布爲滯鈍者、乃上海紗之進口故也、</p>
<p>維縣　花色布銷路尙奸、原色布無交易銷路尤爲呆滯、</p>

<p>昨晨在陳宅重要集議</p>
<p>財宋交陳尙未允復職</p>
<p>行政院長汪精衛、來滬挽勸財政部長宋子文、交通部長陳銘樞、屬即打銷辭意、昨晨九時、復在陳銘樞宅有重要集議、參與者、有財政部長宋子文、交通部長陳銘樞、鐵道部長顧孟餘、實業部長陳公博、及汪氏、席間討論中央財政整個計劃、並竭力挽勸宋陳二氏復職、至十一時半始散聞陳銘樞辭意堅决、宋子文經汪力勸後、意稍較活動、汪氏以此行已告一段落、遂於昨日下午二時二十五分、由眞茹乘專車返京、詳情分誌如下、</p>

<p>汪精衛之談話　當會議告竣時、汪精衛宋子文兩氏、首先外出、據汪氏語華東社記者、宋陳兩部長之辭職、實因措施困難之故、吾人於此挽留宋部長之時、實應帮同宋部長打開此項僵局、至於陳部長、則在環境上、亦有不得已之困難、吾人亦應設法排除、今日會議、業已透澈討論、關於財政方面、因軍費佔財部支出之大部份、故擬與各方面行通盤洽商、始可籌一解决方法也、</p>
<p>圓桌會與復交　汪氏繼又談圓桌會議與對俄復交問題、謂圓桌會議、吾方係接受國聯主張、將中日關於東北與上海問題、得一圓滿之解决、吾方根據國聯决議與旣定主張、當可於相當時期、參加該會、惟日方今高唱東北與上海事件個别解决之說、此不得特與國聯原議範圍相反、即與中央旣定之方針、亦絶對相反、中央當局、對原定主張、絲毫不變、如果日方主張、將上海事件·與東北事件·個别解决、則吾方始終拒絶參加、至於對俄復交、中央業已討論至再、亦已擬定確切辦法、待最後之决定、即可實現、吾人應認清對俄復交與聯俄、係截然兩事、而復交與容共、亦截然兩事、此時中央尙在審重討論、一方亦須洞悉蘇俄現下之情形也、汪氏又謂、中央對東北問題、始終加以注意、日方進逼無已、中央自必加以抵抗、惟此時亦應事先準備、吾人祗須默察俄日兩方現下之情形、可以洞悉事前之必須有充分準備、吾人對外抵抗、應處主動地位、而不應處於被動地位也云云、</p>

<p>宋陳兩氏態度　據確實消息、財長宋子文氏、因財政困難、乃稱病辭職、交長陳銘樞氏亦以環境困難、提出辭呈、茲因汪精衛氏來滬挽留後、宋氏辭意已稍活動、惟交通部長陳銘樞氏、則以種種關係、仍表堅辭、據路局方面消息、陳氏將於今日返京一行、此係料理私事、與長職事仲、初無關係、交部政務、在未經　定相當人選時、暫由交次陳孚木氏代　云、</p>
<p>汪氏昨晚抵京　南京九日電　、汪專車本晚九點到站、謂滬行結果甚　、粤事由胡漢民·伍朝樞·盡力調停、可望不見兵戎、又息、汪方對于孫科提議改造黨務問題、約定在三中全會討論之、孫擬俟三中全會、採納其主張後、即行來京、在最近期内、暫不就立法院長、</p>

<p>滬江大學之講演</p>
<p>國民政府康藏委員劉曼卿女士、最近受國府任爲康藏調查專員於昨晚乘法郵船、今晨出口、赴香港轉道安南、由雲南伊西再轉巴塘、赴西藏、從事調查康藏近狀、并宣達國府發展康藏文化實業計劃、定期兩年後回滬、康藏僻處邊陲、與内地殊形隔閡、故此次劉女士之行、實負有貫通民族情感之重大責任也、</p>
<p>餞行　昨日中午、中國邊疆學會黄警頑、西北學會郭維屏、西北問題研究會胡庶華、邊疆研究會劉良模、西北墾屯學會嚴子端、及華南植業公司汪蔚丹等假功德林設筵爲劉女士餞行、席半、黄警頑起立致詞云、謹祝劉女士一路平安、并云康藏爲中國天然富源、亟待開發、能開發實業、即足以救垂危之中國、劉女士此行實負有此項重大責任、蓋中國目前極重要的事、因爲民窮財盡到極痛苦的時期了、據海關報告、去年全國入口貨超出出口貨竟達五萬萬元、其中以農産品爲最多、中國向來以農立國的、而且地大物博、鑛産豐富、現在反要仰給外國、這是很危險的、如再不設法補救、不待帝國主義者用兵艦利砲來亡中國、中國自己也會滅了、挽救的方法、</p>
<p>便是振興實業、開發鑛産、實業發展、和鑛産發展以後一切需用材料、不致仰給於人、所以我們民生改進社同志、决心從事於此、也希望劉女士以後有良好的指示、并希望本地與康藏的同志、時相往來以求合作、而利民族、此則有賴於劉女士之努力云云、繼有滬江大學陳詠聲女士之致詞、略謂上海有很多靑年、希望去康藏從事開發工作、此非惟足以挽回利權、并可救濟失業現象、請劉女士先去康藏宣傳布置、以便此間靑年前往云云、後由劉女士致謝詞、略云、今日承邊疆各團體等之盛情、并蒙敎育新聞各界諸位先生之指敎、不勝感謝與榮幸、余此次重赴康藏之任務係受中央調查康藏近狀、并宣達此間之文化於康藏、因余係藏人、較能明白康藏情形也、惟本人學識淺薄、還須諸位隨時指導、下次東來、擬率康藏靑年數位同來此間求學、藉以開發邊陲民智、俟交通稍能便利時、甚盼諸位亦赴康藏一行、俾多指導云云三時餘席終、攝影而散、</p>
<p>演講　上海滬江大學對于提倡到邊疆去、素極注重、久有邊疆問題研究社之組織、該社昨聞中央特派調查康藏專員劉曼卿女士蒞滬、特請其到校講演、首由劉良模君致詞介紹、繼即劉女士演說、略謂、本人此次再赴康藏、係完成民國十八年使命、宣揚中央德意、堅其内向之心、以固我國、惟藏中糾紛、迄難排解、實際仍多隔閡、而全藏民衆、日處于川藏軍隊壓迫之下、</p>
<p>尤爲水深火熱、以言藏地敎育、迄今仍極幼稚、無漢文學校、不過近來達賴不時派遣學生赴英留學、頗能取人之長、補我之短、而其崇奉佛敎、到處寺廟林立、則猶如故、若其民風敦厚、藴藏豐富、幅員廣漠、實爲中國天然屏障、在政府固應設法招撫、不容自撤藩離、而在靑年、尤當提倡到康藏去、啟他人之智懸、藉謀吾人事業發展、詞極精警動聽、趣味雋永、聞講畢、劉女士復于該核同學對康藏各種問題、作學術上之採討、講解詳盡、散會時已日薄崦嵫矣、</p>

<h3 id="c167">允讓荷花塘 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>招商局交涉之結果</p>
<p>英商怡和洋行在鎭江荷花塘江面、設立躉船、佔我江面水權、此事發生、尙在民國四年、迄今已歷十餘載、該處水面權、屬於招商局所有歷年交涉、英商掯不交回、直至現在、方始由李總辦偉侯爭回、茲將此事經過、詳誌如下、</p>
<p>被佔經過　英商怡和洋行、在長江航輪至多、鎭江爲重要商、埠、輪船上下、均須靠停、該處江面、招商局闢有碼頭、前面即係荷花塘、爲停輪最衝要之區、民四經鎭江關稅務司、將該江面圈給怡和、而所占面積至巨、怡和在該江面上、安置躉船、搆造工事、十餘年來、該處娘面、驟被英商占奪、</p>
<p>交涉情形　招商局在鎭江一埠、營業頗巨、荷花塘江面、適當碼頭貨棧之前、其水面權自屬該局、自被怡和所占後、招商局於民國七年、曾根據理由、向英商交涉、力爭收回、當時怡和諉稱、由海關指給、非出自占、不允交回、迨至民十九、趙鐵橋任整理招商局專員、舊案重提、曾派王允章科長·及船務課長王朋蒙、和怡和一再交涉、並與鎭關稅司力爭、當時怡和提出可以遷讓、但須認一切建築費、約需二十萬元、此事遂告擱淺、</p>
<p>實行收回　此次招商局改組、董事會長李偉侯、調任總辦、接任之後、查核接管卷中、以荷花塘江面、被外商所占、不特攸關商局營業、而且妨碍國家主權、遂由李總辦仍派王允章辦理收回該處江面事宜、一面向治和力爭、一面提出理由、要求鎭關稅司另指新地、爲怡和躉船地點、經過一月之久、始告成功、現怡和已允將荷花塘水面躉船拆除、讓回商局、惟躉船工事内之附屬樁練等作價、歸商局收買、所費無幾、十餘年懸案、一旦解决矣、</p>

<p>蓋現下閘北災區民衆、多亟待此項賠欵、以待復興事業之進行也云、</p>
<p>協進會之宣言　淞滬一帶、此次被災各户、其所受物貨上之損失、與夫工商業所遭之燬壞、創鉅痛深、恢復難期、所整以爲重興之資及生活之費者、即爲各户投保火險之賠欵、乃中西各承保之保險公司、每多推諉、延不賠償、使被災者保費旣擲於虚耗、保欵竟無從取得、財産蕩然、呼籲無門、痛苦情形、非可言喻、直接受其損害者、雖係保户、而間接受其損害者、商店店員·工廠職工·則實有十百倍於保户、皆因恢復無術、羣趨失業、其影響於社會生計者、至大且鉅、各保險公司、苟能了解吾淞滬災黎現處之地位、與夫自身所處之環境、以利已利人之精神、確立他日合作之基礎、亟應有相當之解决、乃遷移日久、迄無辦法、旣背人情、又乖先例、保户因積不能平、計無所出、迫不得已、乃有本會之組織、不期而集者、三千餘户、總計保額、數逾千萬、合羣衆之力量、予相當之周旋、團結一致、奮門到底、不達目的、誓不中止、除向國民政府及上海市政府呈請備案救濟外、尙希各界人士、予以同情之援助、僅此宣言、諸惟公鑒</p>

<p>市公安局捕去工友二十餘人</p>
<p>前夜有重要會議情勢甚嚴重</p>
<p>報界工會發出消息云、上海報界工界、自本月一日宣告申新時三報罷工、援助時事新報被迫離館工友後、旋經杜月笙君出任調解、該會以第三者之善意調停、並顧全社會消息起見、當經接受申新時三報先行復工、時事新報開除工友問題、</p>
<p>由杜君負責談判等情、已詳前報、截至前日、尙未有具體結果之際、忽於前日（八日）下午六時、時事新報資方嗾使市公安局偵緝隊、派大批探捕赴該會會所、將時事新報被開除之二十餘工友捕去、並將該會器具什物全行搗毁、該會聞悉後、即於八日夜召集緊急會議、僉謂時事新報資方旣將該工友等開除、事經兩月、未得结果、該工友等旣遭失業之痛苦、今又罹此旡妄之災、時事新報資方實太忍心、羣情激昂、形勢緊張、當經議决具體辦法數項、（暫不發表）昨日（九日）該會當即派代表携呈至市政府社會局市黨部、要求釋放被捕工友、並澈究主使搗毁之人、一面又分赴中委何香凝行政院長汪精衛處、</p>
<p>請願設法釋放被捕工友、結果均允法釋放、昨日該會並發出宣言如下、同胞們、勞苦的兄弟們、我們報界工會自被時事新報資本家公然破壞壓迫而後、所受的創傷與痛苦、眞是罄竹難書、然而我們爲了維護正義與公理、爲了保障自己切身的利益、雖致犧牲一切、還要與之作堅决的抵抗、始終不願退讓的四月二日時事新報資本</p>
<p>家因强迫工友代印大晚報、致起衝突、而致全體解僱、這在資本家方面、是種政意挑釁的方法、</p>
<p>所以在事前旣有嚴密的準備、事後又有妥善的佈置、致使數十工友、皆遭失業、整個組織、被其破壞、其後雖經我們的一再交涉、各工會努力援助、時事新報當局、終不稍退讓、在其一貫的策略上、很明顯的使我們看出不破壞我們整個工會的組織、决不干休、於是我們爲了保障自己、才有這次六月一日的同盟罷工、罷工而後、</p>
<p>即有杜月笙君出來調停、當時我們也就承認了杜君的善意調停、一致復工、然而那裏曉得、我們的復工、原爲使風潮不致擴大、而時事新報資本家見我們旣已復工、不但又堅持其原來的破壞我們的策略、並且變本加厲的、一方面誣一部份上工工友爲搗亂份子勾結巡捕房加以逮捕、一方面又與公安局聯合一致於前日（八日）下午六時、派來大批武裝探警至本會會所、不問情由、將我時事新報被迫離館工友王克剛等二十二人、一一加以逮捕、並將會内佈置、搗毁一空、這種無理暴行、竟取公然開演於靑天白日的上海、並由中國官廳爲之執行、說來是使我們多麽痛心而憤慨呀、竊思我們這次工潮的遠因和近因、完全是時事新報當局所造成、我們爲要保護自己、便不得不出此最後的手段、而時事新報資本家竟不惜一再的向我們進攻、我們處此生死存亡的緊急關頭、如當局仍舊偏重時事新報館方、濫用權力、摧殘工運、那末我們只有重新盡我們所有的力量、與之作一次最後的鬥爭同胞們工友們、我們已被壓迫得已忍無可忍了我們爲了生存、只有走上奮鬥的道路希望在這鬥爭的過程中予我們以有力的援助、上海報界公會六月九日、</p>

<p>這是愛國靑年，採辦衣料時的决心。</p>
<p>！唉！這疋萬載夏布的價目太貴了。每尺八角五分，我不會買紡綢麽？那一疋，粗而且黄，每尺也要三角五分，穿在身上，很不漂亮。</p>
<p>這是愛國靑年在布店裏面自言自語。</p>
<p>！先生，買了麻紗罷，又細潔，又白凈，穿在身上又漂亮，價錢又相巧，每尺不到三毛錢。</p>
<p>麻紗不是東洋發麽？</p>
<p>！不，先生，小店裏的麻紗，是西洋貨。你瞧！細潔不細潔，白凈不白凈？</p>
<p>！果然不錯，替我剪了三丈六尺罷；剪雖剪，是不是西洋貨，有些懷疑！</p>

<p>丨寳山路到砲臺灣</p>
<p>淞滬支線通車的第二天，剛好是禮拜日，我便决定到砲臺灣去一次。</p>
<p>車子從寳山路開出，北面便是殘碎火焦的寳山路。當車子掠過每一座破燬的房屋的時候，眞不能使人忍心去看呵！你想那烈火燃燒的樣子吧，你想扶老携幼避過子彈逃命的同胞邑，死神正是在追逐着他們，家，是被燒在火裏了。一九三二年眞不是一個太平的年頭呵。</p>
<p>車子停在天通菴，日本的軍隊還駐紮在那裏，眞給人無限的剌激。一路到江灣、所有的學校，工廠，都被燬了。從車子裏可以望得見的學校如勞働，法學院，愛國，都殘缺的倒在這蝴蝶紛飛野花四開的鄉村裏；所有的工廠大都是無法再恢復的了！</p>
<p>經過高境廟到張華浜，過去便是蕰藻浜了。車子到那裏爲終點，不再開過去走了。</p>
<p>在車站上便可以看見日華紗廠上飄揚的太陽旗，那裏面，據說還有軍隊紮駐着呵。</p>
<p>沿蕰藻浜外馬路走上全部被燬去的吳淞鎭，又經過經日人題名的所謂「白川橋」，和「金澤橋」，馬路上有着臨時搭起來做生意的商店，那些，該是吳淞鎭上的商人吧。然而漸趨興旺的吳淞鎭呵，你也遭了這次的大刦了。</p>
<p>在馬路上維持着秩序的，便是所謂北平的「特别警察」了；遠看那白的綁腿，我還當是異國的警察呢。</p>
<p>總刮的說，蕰藻浜和吳淞鎭是全部燬了的。</p>
<p>由吳淞鎭盡頭再走去，便是砲臺灣了。我乃轉向北沿中公路直到已聞被燬的中國公學去看一看。</p>
<p>該校除了新近才落成的科學館朝南中了一砲，餘外則尙完好可以修復以外，如鐘樓，圖書館，大禮堂。舊宿舍，及</p>
<p>東首該校前校長馬君武經手建築的三樓新宿舍，可以說完全毁了，兩座敎職員宿舍，在東南角都中了一砲，餘外都還好。該校如要恢復原狀，非四五十萬恐怕不能動手吧。</p>
<p>從中公出來，便上南北砲臺去。</p>
<p>這眞如憑弔古跡和名勝一樣的熱閙，到砲臺的那條路上，太擠了。那初夏新裝的女人，坐着有彈性燒着軋士林的磨托卡没着泥濘的小路駛上以前視爲禁地的砲臺去。爬上砲臺，那一望無際的潺潺江水，那異國二十四隻兵艦和無數的飛機猛轟這毫無遮蔽的古舊砲臺，怎樣可以使英勇的軍隊再守下去呢？</p>
<p>混獨滲着血漬的黄浦江，對着憑弔的人士，流着無盡的眼涙，嘆着無聲息的氣；對着那大小幾十座被燬的鋼砲，是那樣悵望的不斷的流去。</p>
<p>砲臺前後左右，都有飛機擲彈陷爲深坑的巨穴，而水門汀澆成的砲基，也炸碎了，零亂的砲彈也還臥在破燬鋼砲的邊緣；熱血染遍了的砲臺，潺潺的江水，恐怕也不容易洗凈吧。</p>

<p>— 濳</p>
<p>現在是自由的時代。一般靑年人都愛說的是「自由」「戀愛」。所以婚姻的自由。也大爲增加。不過結婚自由了。離婚的數目也同時加多。這是什麽道理呢。固然有許多離婚的例子是不得已的。是出於無可如何的。但是據我觀察起來。一般自由結婚而又繼之離婚的。却有特别的原因。</p>
<p>第一、愛人是好做的。會哭會笑會打扮便行了。要是做一個妻子却非常的困難。在未結婚前丈夫看你是怎麽一個能講會說有程度的女子。等到结緍以後却不善奉事丈夫公婆。好吃懶動。這樣自然是不妥了。所以離婚的第一個原因便是欠缺修養。</p>
<p>第二、靑年人的腦筋是浮動的。今兒看的戀愛小說。明兒看的愛情電影。不錯。</p>

<p>— 聶曾紀芬述男其杰撰文</p>
<p>蓋肉體欲望。皆屬私小之萌動。而與公德心如水火之不能兩立者。必能克除私人欲望。而後一切建設有可期。王陽明日。殺山中賊易。殺心中賊難。能克心中之敵。即自勝自强之謂也。除以上所述政治家外。他如大思想家盧梭。托爾斯泰。馬克思。苦魯巴金。皆能屏斥物質</p>
<p>之享用。而自甘於儉苦淡泊之生活。盧氏托氏皆戒絶肉食者。（苦氏似亦不食肉）又如近世大科學家艾迪生。飲食起居。皆在試騐室中。蓋於世俗之欲樂無所好也。汽車界兩雄。福德與斯龍司。皆不沾烟酒。不喜游樂。大科學家艾因斯坦。撲拙淡泊。無利欲心。某影獻公司請其一登銀幕演說。酬資二十萬美金。艾氏謝絶之。蓋謂學問非爲金錢也。其他科學名人。清操多有類此。其學術</p>
<p>事業之成就。初非企圖肉體之享用。故不得謂有欲望而後有發明也。反是。大發明家思想家由於情欲濃厚者。未之前聞。故近人言發展欲望所以促進科學與文化者。純屬臆說。不能證以事效。惟藉此自文其過而已。求其反證。則中外歷史。凡由治安時代而至於破壞。皆欲望發展之效。事證昭昭。不可勝述也。乃至近年歐洲之大戰。現今列國相持之危局。我國二十年來之内爭。亦何一非發展欲望之表現乎。其破壞程度。至可慘傷。其所産生之奇巧發明。亦無非爲破壞與爭欺之用。欲望豈嘗有補於世界之進化哉。</p>
<p>照樣做做是很有趣呀。於是對於夫或妻往往起了久而生厭的心理。一心只想追求那小說上空洞的虚幻的浪漫。結果便釀成些不幸的事件了。所以離婚的第二個原因便是缺乏責任心。</p>
<p>第三、現在社會的環境實在也太不好了。靑年人的希奇古怪的裝束。驕奢淫佚放縱的舉動。在在都有不好的影響。我們常常看到甚至於有所謂大學學生的。他們會無端的寫些信與他半知的女子什麽「你的學問我佩服呀！你的信寫得眞好呀！」。「我希望我們能做朋友。好嗎」「我們只做個文墨之交」。這些信是隨意而發的。自己有配偶也好。對方有配偶也好。於是結果意志薄弱者遂難免自暴自棄了。所以離婚的第三個原因便是環境惡劣。</p>
<p>靑年人倘若能注意到這三種原因而加以預防。或者於家庭幸福上亦不無小補呢。</p>

<p>安玉田本想挪移到車窗前。揭開窗簾。向外窺看。無如這一面并不對着月台。須拉開了車廂門走出去。向那一邊過道上的車窗才看得見。偏偏這車廂門上的機括。又因軍用失修。發生了障碍。剛才被郭副官臨走時回手一帶。用力過猛。關得非常嚴密。急切還拉拔不開。無可如何。仍復頽然坐下。外面的軍樂聲。軍官喊敬禮的口令聲。却已在破空而起。顯見得葉督軍是上了車了。接著這一節車上的過道中。一陣陣皮靴底踹得車板亂響。似有許多人也跑上車來。忽地這車廂門被人從外面猛力拉開。鑽進來四五個雄糾糾氣昻昻衛隊上的武士。肩上背著手提式自動槍。胸前繋著無數小直條兒子彈皮帶。一眼看見安玉田獨占了一個床位。就七嘴八舌的惡狠狠盤問他是什麽人。安玉田忙把參議的官銜回報出。并說明是郭副官奉命招待了來的。這其中有一個滿臉横肉殺氣最重的彪形大漢。仍是不信。就啐了他一臉的吐沬。其勢洶洶的直指著他的鼻尖怒吼道。别瞎吹啦。是參議怎麽不掛徽章呢。我知道。你這小子是運動好了小郭。由他偷偷帶你上來。却擠得咱们床舖不夠。安玉田聽出這武士是駡他冒充官長與混坐專車。不由也勃然大怒。亟要辯明。怎奈伸手向懷裏一摸。一封委任狀已交與了梁笑雲。此時拿不出一個眞憑實據。想要喊醒上面那個朱副官與他作證。那朱副官又只顧睡覺。不肯翻過身來。急得安玉田面紅耳赤、靑筋凸脹。惟有氣冲冲向外便走道。我是今天才接著委任。所以没來得及領徽章。你們不相信。我就走好了。我還有太太在五太太包房裏呢。待我去找著郭副官或毛副官。還怕没有我的地方蹲嗎。這時。專車已在這吵閙聲中開動。安玉田摇摇晃晃的走了幾步。那幾個武士忽又追上來拖了他回去道。你這人。怎麽那樣不知輕重。這車上叚叚都派有崗位。能容你這没帶徽章的隨便往裏闖嗎。我勸你少找麻煩。還是在這兒老實蹲一會吧。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>十九路軍自奉調赴閩剿共消息傳播後，各方函電交馳，或派代表挽留，本來十九路軍，爲國犧牲，忠勇抗敵，應當竭誠挽留，表示敬仰之意，但我的主張，却不如此，其理由有三，</p>
<p>一，日本軍隊且將撤盡，現在旣不抵抗，自無駐紮的必要，此其一，</p>
<p>一，現共黨非常猖獗，蔓延漸廣，無論其調遣，或尙有别種原因，但剿共亦是正盤正盞的一回事，此其二，</p>
<p>一，現在日軍雖將撤盡，而我國軍隊，駐紮於京滬滬杭兩路者，其數尙不在少，軍隊之集合旣多，往往易生誤會，滋生事端，</p>
<p>君子愛人以德，决不能舍棄事實，而僅憑感情用事也，</p>

<h3 id="c218">菜菓早熟法 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>蔬菜和水菓，越時新越鮮味，他的售價較高，買主也歡迎的，所以園丁老圃，嘗想法改良他的種植，在短時期間</p>
<p>，産生出成熟的菜菓，希望獲得較厚的利益，以迎合買主的心理，他們雖不知道科學的方法，我們用科學的眼光去看他，有時很合科學的原理，可惜他們没有科學的根基，高深的學理，加以種種的研究，到那神化的領域，現在我介紹一點法子，給他們可以得到一種參考，我想有志趣於園藝的人們，是很歡迎的，</p>
<p>用電燈種植法　這種方法是使菜菓與葉枝受到熱力和光綫，在短時期間生長濃厚的綠葉和繁盛的菓實，他的設備也是很簡便的，就在護菜菓的暖房中，裝置發光較强的電燈，能掛一温度表測騐温度更好，這個法子德國有一個種值的人，曾在他護花暖房中發見植物受電的熱力與光線，花菓與枝葉竟能碩大而佳良，屢試屢騐，我們倘能依法按理試之定能得到良好的結果，</p>
<p>用化學品法　這種法子，是一位美國納佛大學農科主任斯華脫博士Dr　Rob</p>
<p>err　Stewart報告的，他說，用化學方法，可使未成熟的菓實與蔬菜，早期成熟，而菓實菜蔬的香味，並不變改，他在田間用帆布篷掩護其半，再在帆布篷内，向蔬菜噴以用酒精與硫酸製成的化藥品名Ethylene，不到幾天，帆布下的蔬菜，業已生長繁盛，且已成熟，而未掩在帆布下的蔬菜，則仍痿短瘦小，未曾成熟，</p>
<p>又有一試騐，用未熟的香蕉二棵，割懸在架上，一則噴灑Ethylene一則不灑，經四十八小時，其灑Ethylene的已成熟，啖之與天然成熟的香味完全一樣，而未灑化學藥品的，郤依舊靑綠生硬，未曾成熟，這個法子也是很容易做到的，我們祇須用酒精與硫酸製成Ethylene，酌景施於萊菓上就成的，</p>

<p>— 王士本</p>
<p>老虎灶旁邊，是上海娘姨們的談話處所，她們碰到了同行中，必得講個三言兩語，談話的料資，不脫（講東家）三字的範團，現在把她們的談話，紀錄幾句在下</p>
<p>面，</p>
<p>甲「姐姐，你在×公館，生活忙吧，一個月賺多少錢呢？」</p>
<p>乙「唉！不要說起，别人看來，我們這裏，老爺是在北平××府做官，家裏只有這位×太太，生活一定很少的，並且太太很闊綽，一定有點進益，但是不曉很這位太太，脾氣很歹，在外面軋朋友，很闊，然而對待府下人，是哼！苛刻得利害，只有每月這五只老洋，别樣外快一鈿都没有，講到生活，雖然老爺出門，只有好一人，你不曉得好的男女朋友，多得很，天天進進出出，閙得使我頭痛，這般少爺小姐，都是大氣派，呌我一個人，如何服侍得週，有一些不周到，太太就要駡我，近來和那個洋行小鬼小王，有意思，兩家頭天天去跳舞，看戲，弄到半夜三更回來，還是要茶要水，姐姐，你道苦不苦？」</p>
<p>甲「嚎！原來這樣，講到我們這裏，太太人還好，只有兩個小姐，一言難盡，天天打扮得像妖精，也是跳舞啊吃大菜啊，脾氣歹來邪氣，一個不對，就要駡人，打人，不要說小了頭，被她打得落花流水，就是我們娘姨，也時常捱駡受氣，雖然一天用用這麽幾十塊，但是我們跟前，一個人小錢都不肯化的，忙是忙得很，大小姐做什麽，二小姐做什麽，呌得一刻不停，吃倒吃好們的碗頭碗脚，唉！這樣人家，我想不要做哩！」</p>
<p>丙「你兩家倒還好，像我們這裏，東家是一對少年夫婦，男的在銀行裏做事，少奶奶天天到××公司賭博，近來輸了不少，拆爛汚拿家裏的東西當掉，少爺覺着查究，反說是娘姨偷的，像這樣寃屈我，看起來我也不高興做了！」</p>
<p>丁「姐姐們，不要說了，在上海吃這碗飯，家家一樣，那一家不勢利，你要換人家，我看來也不及，因爲這種有錢的人，都是作威作福，以爲對待傭人，應當這樣，不曉得有錢的，也是阿媽養的，尋飯吃的，也有爺娘養的，只錯幾個錢，呌你們老爺啦，太太啦，一樣是個人，這樣糟塌窮人，眞眞不想得諒啊，所以我勸兩位姐姐，步生不如步熟，你要換，不過是換湯不湯藥哩！」</p>

<p>— 雲</p>
<p>我今天和Ａ談起處世方法，我就請敎他。</p>
<p>「處世的方法，說來却很簡單，可以「風馬牛」三字了之，可是着實不容易做呢！』他說。</p>
<p>「風馬牛不是說隨便什麽事不聞不問嗎？那是變成出世而不是入世了。」</p>
<p>「這風馬牛不是那風馬牛」他笑着回答，「這是說出風頭，拍馬屁，吹牛皮。」</p>
<p>「咦！我又不是去做政治舞臺裏小走狗，」我奇怪地問。</p>
<p>「哈！無論你進政界也好，進商界也好，談戀愛也好，想做學者名流也好，什麽什麽都好，總用得着這風馬牛。若是用得純熟，嬌妻美妾，高衙大厦，都辦得到。不然就得苦一輩子。風馬牛好似命運之神，操生殺之權，你不要把它看得太輕，」</p>

<h3 id="c221">學士論文吾 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>幾天前在家理看著了友人王君所留的便條，知道他有要事和我會面，說是要我做一篇畢業論文，當時我想「這可奇怪了，畢業論文，這關我什麽事呢？自己旣非大學生，更用不著畢業，······」其後不久我也就因事忘懷了，不過我總算答允了王君的會晤。</p>
<p>當然，今天星期日我有工夫而也不得不如約的在家裏等候王君了，當他到臨的時候，正是午後不久，那時我正懶懶地睡在床上休息我的疲倦。</p>
<p>因爲整年的不見，我對於他的生活狀况，自然不免隔陔起來，然而由於他那嶄新的白嗶嗶嘰褲子和藍地白條紋法蘭絨，上衣的熨貼整齊上看來，我猜得準他的生活一定優美甚至比以前更加愜意。</p>
<p>果然，由於他的談話中，我知道他早已是個大學生了，而且現在已臨到畢業的時期，所以畢業論文在他是非常重要。</p>
<p>「我們已是多年的朋友，」王君在忸怩的說：「所以這一篇論文我想你一定肯爲我帮忙的，而且並不要怎樣好，只要是一篇論文就夠了。」</p>
<p>「但是我還没有知道，你究竟是學什麽的呢？是不是政治，經濟？」我問。</p>
<p>「不，我學的是國學。」</p>
<p>「噢？這可難了。你知道我平素對於國學没有研究，而且自己固然很少參考書，一個東方圖書館又給日本人燒了，這怎麽弄得成功呢？」</p>
<p>「不，我想你平素寫的，只要没有發表過，無論那一類的都可以。」</p>
<p>「那不得的呀，先生！譬如說你學的是國學，你若拿一篇經濟的論文去，那也是可以的嗎？」我笑笑地，再三聲明這不可以張冠李戴的原因，但是他仍是固執，仍是說只要是論文就可以，而且同時努力用一切的方法來掩飭其不能動筆的苦衷，然而我始終未能從命，因爲這太强人所難了。·····</p>
<p>當最後我送他出門了以後，我始回味到；「原來學士論文却是這樣的一回事啊！」</p>
<p>當然，爲了他的苦衷，我也不勝同情之至。</p>

<h3 id="c222">女助理員飱 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>去年某機關需要一位擅長小楷的人才，便登了一條豆腐乾般的廣告徵求，統共收到應徵信有三百封之多，弄到某機關目不暇接，不知怎樣取捨法子，代收函件的一爿商店，居然有不少應徵者登門來請求錄取，甘願拿去幾隻洋運動那爿商店同人大嚼一頓，我聽了上面的一叚說話，知道我們男子謀事的不易，失業的這般多，便武斷他揣測女子職業，絶不會如此恐慌？</p>
<p>最近我又聽到一所機關裏，要招請一位女助理員，而得到的結果，正和我的理想成了一個反比例，某機關模仿女靑年會成規，預備用一位女子担任收發，其實就是變像的「傳達」，據說，月薪只有十隻大洋，應徵者有中學肄業生，幼稚園保姆，小學校敎員，醫院看護，旗袍革履，粉面截髮，類多妙齡女郎，某機關當局爲之大驚失色，深覺得不忍敎她們担任這項工作，而又没有較好位置可資安揷，萬想不到這們一徵求；演出這麽一齣女子失業的大悲劇來！</p>
<p>她們並且口口聲聲的說：不拘薪金；耐勞耐苦；甚至有要求立刻觧决着</p>
<p>從前人說，「身上穿着綢，肚裏吃的油；」她們身上何嘗不穿着綢，現在纔曉得未必如是，可憐是硬撑塲面罷了，最後决定的一位據好說，好家裏從前在閘北開着店舖，滬變之後，全家蕩然無存，便失了業······但是冒雨而來的仍繼續不斷，聽到已有人「獲選」，還硬着頭皮說，我是代朋友來問問看的，這是何等痛心要臉的話呀！我不知道還是暴日所賜呢？還是社會已到了這步田地？想到這裏，又驚駭到舞女歌伶倡妓所以如此之多。</p>

<p>走過鄭家木橋的時候，見一家旅館的門口，站着了許多人望牆壁瞧，我也就無意識地擠着觀觀熱閙，劈頭看到的是「文學博士××客」寫得很整齊的一張紙招牌，接着二邊按排的是幾張小照，影中人呢？却都是黨國要人，但其中也有例外的，那是一張給日人綁架去在滿洲國做提綫戲主角，「滿洲執政」的玉照，</p>
<p>「這又是無聊的江湖賣藝者的廣告」我會意似的想着，同時却想拔脚開步走，因爲在上海這樣把戲，眞是司空見慣，無非賣賣野人頭，騙口飯吃罷了，對得意要人，歌功崇德，對過去的紅人，加以不完善的批評與指摘，但是掛着文學博士的賣藝者，還是第一次遇見，爲了要覘博士的學識起見，且再留連下看去，在每張的玉照下，都題着似詩非詩，似評非評的句子，最後一張是位少年戎裝，標着「張學良眞影」五字，我想這</p>
<p>是一位崇朝之間，能拱生而讓二省版圖出名不抵抗的領袖，最會迎合潮流的批命先生，不知怎樣的批評哩？仔細看去，却也是四句詩，是；</p>
<p>面圓眉粗腮頦横，</p>
<p>耳高肉厚黑睛平，</p>
<p>麟身體壯威雄勢，</p>
<p>佐國忠良獨秉名，</p>
<p>面圓眉精幾個字，就不像描寫張家大少爺的眞容，我又把佐國忠良獨秉名，我重複的讀了一句，不覺好笑起來，好一位恭維張大少的文學博士，惜乎居住上海，要是在張學良的左右恭維着，一定會被見賞，說不定保荐做一個官呢？</p>
<p>帶兵數十萬，不禦外侮，獨縱情聲色犬馬之間，誤國誤民，莫此爲甚，還有所謂文學博士也者，拿他做愰子，還恭維上了一個佐國忠良的美名，眞不知話從那裏說起？</p>
<p>好一個佐國忠良獨秉名的張學良，於今得一知己，眞可留芳百世了，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Political Rewards and Punishments <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its thirty-ninth meeting on the seventh. It was decided to request the National Government to issue a clear commendation for Han Fuju, Chairman of Shandong Province, for his outstanding performance in suppressing opium. In today's world where rewards and punishments have long been unclear, we listen to this as if hearing a voice in an empty valley, refreshing our ears and eyes. However, we still cannot help but speak.</p>
<p>In recent years, military men have each held onto their troops and acted independently, causing division and disintegration. The government's discipline has been weak, and punishments are out of the question. Rewards are also not being given. Military men rely on their military strength and do as they please. The government can only pretend to be deaf and dumb, ignoring them. The people suffer like they are in water and fire, with no one to complain to, which has been the case for a long time.</p>
<p>Taking opium suppression as an example, the central government's order to suppress opium is indeed clearly announced, and the whole country admires it. Although some provinces, such as Shandong and Zhejiang, have strictly implemented it, eradicating opium seedlings and strictly prohibiting selling and smoking, acting vigorously with obvious achievements, this is not the case everywhere. The forced planting and selling, and the monopolized transportation of opium by military men in various places, openly doing it without any scruples, are also common sights and sounds. We have not seen the government punish them. Furthermore, some conscienceless people, using the excuse of "prohibition through taxation", advocate for public opium sales. Many provinces have secretly already implemented this, harming the people and the country more than anything else. We have not seen the government reprimand or punish them either. If the opium suppression in Shandong Province is considered commendable, then those who force planting and selling and those who oversee public sales in other provinces should be considered guilty. Those who suppress opium should be rewarded, while those who force planting and selling should be punished. Having rewards without punishments means that rewards and punishments are unclear. How can this establish discipline and maintain the government's authority?</p>
<p>Due to the lack of political rewards and punishments, and the lack of clarity between right and wrong, the country's laws and regulations have been disregarded. Many officials are corrupt, and the politics are in disarray. For example, in recent years, the members of the Control Yuan have repeatedly impeached high officials, but the results have been without response. Therefore, the achievements of the Control Yuan's supervision, apart from impeaching several county magistrates, are non-existent. From this, it can be seen that the country's laws are only weapons for the strong to oppress the weak, and are only used to shackle the common people. If one has power and influence, the law has no effect. Mr. Yu Youren's angry statement last year, "Impeachment with guns," was indeed said with great emotion.</p>
<p>We believe that if our country wants to establish a unified and powerful central government, it must clarify rewards and punishments and distinguish right from wrong. Those who bear the important responsibility of politics should correct themselves to correct others, and establish themselves to establish others. The nation's laws and decrees must not be compromised in the slightest, and they must not be afraid of powerful forces, compromising to seek complete success. Only then can discipline be established, perceptions corrected, and the authority of the government established. Today, if opium suppression is considered right, then forced planting and selling are all considered wrong. If we reward one opium suppressor while tolerating and appeasing the many who force planting and selling, and not even questioning them, then this is too comical. Therefore, if the authorities want to sincerely suppress opium and truly rectify officialdom, they must show further action.</p>

<p>(Qingdao) The League of Nations investigative team's special train arrived in Qingdao at 9:15 PM on the ninth, including Team Leader Lytton, German Commissioner Schnee, Italian Commissioner Marquis Aldrovandi, Gu Weijun, Yan Deqing, Liu Chongji, Ge Guangting, Ambassador Yoshida and more than ten others. Lytton and others got off the train, exchanged brief pleasantries with those who came to welcome them, and then went to the Governor's Mansion to rest. They are scheduled to meet with representatives from all sectors at 8:00 AM on the tenth, pay a visit to Mayor Shen at 9:00 AM, and visit the traces of the war inside and outside the city. After attending the Mayor's welcoming banquet at noon, they will tour Laoshan. They will attend a banquet hosted by all sectors at 6:00 PM, and then take the special train to Jinan at 7:00 PM. Security was very tight at the train station. Those who went to the station to welcome them included Shen Honglie, heads of various agencies, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Trade Union, the academic community, the Railway Bureau, the press, consuls from various countries, and several hundred others. (Ninth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Qingdao, Sir Lytton and his party left Jinan for Qingdao at 10:15 AM today. Before the departure of the special train, a security train carrying railway staff and security personnel departed first, responsible for the security of Sir Lytton and his party. The party is expected to arrive in Qingdao at 8:50 PM. Sir Lytton, Dr. Schnee, and Earl Aldrovandi will stay at the Mayor's residence, while other Chinese and Japanese accompanying staff will stay at the International Hotel. (Ninth Domei News)</p>

<p>(Jinan) The investigative team arrived in Jinan at 9:00 AM on the ninth, stopping for one hour but not disembarking. They transferred to the Jiaoji Railway to Qingdao at 10:00 AM. Yang Jinsheng, a counselor of the Municipal Government, represented the city to welcome them. The welcoming ceremony in Jinan was kept simple. (Eighth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The investigative team's special train arrived in Jinan at 9:25 AM this morning. Dai Hongyi, the commander of the armored train, arrived first on the Beiping train to pave the way. Zhang Honglie, the director of the Construction Department, representing the Provincial Government, Wen Chenglie, the Mayor of Jinan, all the staff of the Municipal Government, Yang Jinsheng, representing the Qingdao Municipal Government, Ge Guangting, the chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, and representatives from all sectors, a total of more than 500 people, went to the station to welcome them.

<p>(Jinan) Gu Weijun accompanied Lytton and the German and Italian commissioners off the train. After exchanging pleasantries with those who welcomed them, they went to the station's reception hall. Lytton spoke with reporters, with Gu translating. The reporters asked: (1) What are your impressions of the investigative team's trip to the Northeast? Lytton replied, "It is not convenient to talk about impressions, because we are still organizing the materials and have not yet made a general report. What I can say is that we worked hard in the Northeast to investigate and obtained a lot of materials. After we finish organizing them, we can determine the conclusions and make a final general report." (2) What are your hopes for the Sino-Japanese problem? He replied, "I also do not want to talk about my hopes for the time being. However, although the scope of the Sino-Japanese problem is broad, it is different from previous international disputes. But the principle remains the same. The League of Nations' assistance mechanism for the Sino-Japanese problem in the Far East has not been fully applied. Regarding the interpretation of the obligations and rights of both China and Japan in the treaty, we will only follow the principles and spirit of the League of Nations in resolving international disputes, and with a fair mind, there will eventually be a satisfactory solution." (3) What were the difficulties encountered during the trip to the Northeast and Shanhaiguan? He replied, "Of course, we encountered many difficulties during the investigation in the Northeast, but some were resolved after explanations from the authorities. Even if we encounter some difficulties, they are unavoidable under the current circumstances." (Ninth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Qingdao) Shen Honglie returned to Qingdao at 7:30 AM on the ninth. Shen told reporters that he went to Beijing to separately meet Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek to report on the Qingdao municipal situation and the Bohai Sea defense situation. Because the League of Nations investigative team came to Qingdao for inspection, he, as the local official, should personally entertain them. Therefore, he rushed back to Qingdao. The hospitality procedures are set at two banquets. The first banquet will invite foreign consuls and military attachés stationed in Qingdao to accompany them. The second banquet will invite heads of various agencies and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to accompany them. (Ninth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The investigative team believes that the railway issue is at the center of the Sino-Japanese disputes in the Eastern Provinces. The Japanese also used the railway issue as an excuse for the September 18th Incident. After the team went to the Northeast for actual investigation, they have a slightly clearer understanding of the crux of the railway disputes. In order to thoroughly understand the history of each road and its international relations, they specifically requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consult the Ministry of Railways to send the case files of each road and the treaties signed with various countries to the team for review, so that they can be used as reference when compiling the report. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted the Ministry of Railways on the ninth to do so. (Ninth Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Believing that it Cannot be Ignored</p>
<p>Advocating for the Establishment of an International System</p>
<p>London A grave fear that the "Manchurian New Government" will soon appoint Japanese officials to the boundary is said to have been expressed by responsible Sino-British merchants, who claim that the powers should intervene urgently, and cannot sit idly by. This move is further proof that Japan wants to rule Manchuria by means of a tax system that is detrimental to the powers, and is enough to break the entire Chinese customs system, causing endless disputes. The crowd mainly advocates that if there are any changes in Manchuria, then an international system must be established. The Times published an editorial, which quite agrees with the previous view, saying that this proposal should be supported by the Japanese military authorities managing Manchuria, and the Japanese government is second to it. It also said that the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteed the territorial and administrative integrity of China. The Japanese government's actions are suspected of trying to evade the obligations of the treaty. It is not worth it for the Japanese government. (Ninth Reuters News)</p>

<p>Although the Dispute Has Tacitly Dissipated</p>
<p>The Four Countries Still Consider It Important</p>
<p>National News Agency, The Hague, 8th A case brought by England, France, Italy, and Japan, as signatories of the Memel Convention, against Lithuania for violating the Memel Convention opened today at the International Court of Justice. The sixteen judges were presided over by Guerrero of El Salvador. The two accusations were: first, that Micius, the governor appointed by Lithuania, dismissed Böhm, the chairman of the Memel Executive Committee; and second, that after the Memel Parliament refused to express confidence in the new Executive Committee Chairman appointed by Micius, Micius issued an order to dissolve the parliament. Although this dispute has now tacitly dissipated due to the resignation of Micius and the Lithuanian government's major change in attitude towards the Memel region and its majority German residents, the four signatory countries believe that the issue in this dispute is of extreme importance to the future status of Memel. Therefore, they have decided to proceed with the lawsuit.</p>

<p>To Discuss Rural Relief Plans</p>
<p>The Convocation Period is in Mid-August</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th The Seiyukai recently advocated convening the third extraordinary session of Parliament for the rural relief bill. The negotiation meeting between the Seiyukai and Minseito parties decided this today. Prime Minister Saito also considered it inevitable. After the relief bill is established, it was decided to convene Parliament. The convocation period is approximately in early August, and the session will last approximately one week.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th The issue of farmers relief remains the focus of attention of both the government and opposition. The Seiyukai's proposal to lower the value of currency to alleviate the suffering of the people is currently under intense debate. It is feared that it will be difficult to gain acceptance and simply lowering the value of the currency will only cause the prices of securities markets to skyrocket. The Minister of Education, representing the Seiyukai, sought the opinion of Finance Minister Takahashi on this matter. Takahashi strongly opposed it. It is reported that Seiyukai members also have greatly differing opinions on this. The suspension of loan payments and other proposals are currently under intense debate. One point that is agreed upon by all is that finding a solution to the main problem of relieving the plight of farmers is an urgent matter. Because if the delegation of farmers who have arrived in Tokyo are allowed to return empty-handed and without any gains, it is feared that major incidents will occur.</p>

The content of the proposal includes: firmly carrying out low-price countermeasures, consolidating rural debts, implementing public works, establishing rural debt consolidation associations, circulating 100 million yuan in funds with an annual interest rate of 3%, borrowing to replace high-interest loans and providing long-term loans, repaying them in installments over the years, nationalizing fertilizers, storing and requesting distribution to the poor, etc. It requests that this resolution be submitted to this session of Parliament and that an extraordinary meeting be convened within two months.</p>

At this time, the government will implement what can be implemented by emergency imperial edict; otherwise, it will request approval from the extraordinary session of Parliament.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Regarding rural relief countermeasures, a vice-ministerial meeting was held in the Chief Cabinet Secretary's office within the Diet building at noon today.

After a formal agency decision, the government will be forced to implement it. The contents are as follows: 1. Consolidate debt.

<p>German Catholic Center Party</p>
<h3 id="e84">Supports Brüning <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Competition in the Next Parliamentary Election Will Be Fierce</p>
<p>The Papen Cabinet Will Suffer a Major Blow</p>
<p>Small Parties Tend to Merge into Larger Parties</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 8th The Executive Committee of the German Catholic Center Party convened an extraordinary meeting today to decide on the attitude the party should adopt towards the new government. As a result, it unanimously passed a motion of absolute confidence in former Prime Minister Brüning. Since the passage of this important case, the German political world has sparked much speculation, because the German Catholic Center Party is not only the mainstay of the Prussian State Council, but can also influence the political situation in the National Assembly. Now that the party has expressed absolute confidence in Brüning, who is in opposition to the current government, the current Papen cabinet will inevitably suffer a major blow in the National Assembly. Furthermore, the Catholic Center Party has stated that it has not been consulted on the Papen cabinet replacing the Brüning cabinet. This can be seen as a declaration of war against the current government. Now that Brüning has recovered from his heart disease, he gave a very detailed speech at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Catholic Center Party today, giving a very thorough account of his past political achievements up to the time of his departure.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 8th According to a news release from the Catholic Party, former German Prime Minister Brüning will lead the thirty-six electoral districts and be the leading candidate in each district in the next National Assembly election. This decision is due to the fact that the German electoral system differs from that of other countries. Each district may elect the leader of a certain party or faction based on the number of people in each party or faction, rather than an individual as a unit. However, this special situation is not a common occurrence. It is also a way to express respect and obedience to Mr. Brüning. Catholics who previously voted for other parties due to differences in political views can now return as a result of this call. The German people now largely regard Mr. Brüning not only as a figure belonging to a certain party or faction, but as a role model for those who oppose the government. Therefore, all those from the Liberal Party who are dissatisfied with constitutional government and the politics of the Socialist Party will support Mr. Brüning as their master. Based on this view and observation of the German political situation, it can be seen that Germany will experience an unprecedented election war after the European War. Right-wing figures, especially such as the National Socialist Party, will certainly do their utmost to win a majority in the National Assembly, and their long-cherished policies will be implemented without hindrance. However, the opposition party will never loosen its grip and will do its utmost to</p>
<p>interact and maneuver. A new and unique situation will also occur in future German election competitions, namely, the gradual merger of small parties into large parties, and the self-destruction of small parties. In the future, only large parties will be able to maintain their position on the altar. Therefore, small parties were previously like small objects crushed between two millstones in the National Assembly, and will instantly become powder and cease to exist. For example, the Conservative National Party has already announced that it will no longer nominate candidates in the future, and other small parties will have no choice but to follow suit and disappear without a trace. In reality, the lack of economic support, which prevents them from competing with the major parties, is also one of the reasons. Furthermore, a new party has been established, named the Socialist Republican Party. Its leader, who previously belonged to the Socialist Party, was removed for insubordination, named Holsing.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Supplementary Estimate Bill <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th The House of Representatives plenary session opened at 1:20 PM today. After various reports, the Estimate Committee passed: (1) Supplementary to the general estimate of revenue and expenditure for the 7th year of Showa; (continued first reading) committee chairman's report; (1) Supplementary to the special accounting estimate of revenue and expenditure for the 7th year of Showa; (continued first reading) committee chairman's report; (1) Contract must be signed for cases of extra-budgetary state treasury burdens; (continued first reading) committee chairman's report. The above three proposals were submitted in summary. After Committee Chairman Okuchi Kiroku reported on the process and results of the committee, they entered discussion. Takashi Nagashima (Seiyukai) took the podium and said that the current cabinet should copy the active policies of the Seiyukai. His words contained ridicule, but he then stated his intention to support the above three proposals.</p>
<p>Next, Katsumi Kawasaki (Minseito) took the podium and said that the expenses required by this estimate arose due to the prohibition of gold exports. Since the current cabinet was formed not long ago, it must be said that copying that policy was unavoidable. Although there were unsatisfactory points, the Minseito Party recognized this situation and supported it. After scolding the Seiyukai's five-year plan, and criticizing the Seiyukai for the plan being as if it exists but doesn't, he left the podium. At that time, Kokichi Ueda (Seiyukai) moved to end the discussion, and a vote was immediately taken. The speaker then stood and inquired, and was unanimously adopted by the whole, at 2:05 PM.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th After the House of Representatives plenary session passed the supplementary estimate bill, it then submitted items four, five, and six on the agenda. After explaining the reasons, they were handed over to the committee. At 3:30 PM, there was a recess, and at 4:16 PM, the meeting reopened and submitted important bills, one for the Raw Silk Law for Stabilization and Financing Guarantee Purchase, and one for the Loss and Handling Law for Raw Silk Price Stabilization and Financing. After discussion, the following conditions of hope were attached: "It seems insufficient for the government to only dispose of the stockpiled raw silk. It should quickly establish fundamental stabilization measures for the industry and strive to stabilize and improve the industrial world." The original proposal was passed. The meeting adjourned at 4:47 PM.</p>

<p>TASS, Warsaw, 8th The Polska Daily, recognized as the Polish government's official newspaper, recently published several articles by its special correspondent reporting on the Soviet Union's recent equipment. The correspondent's tone was very different from the newspaper's usual writing. His description of the Moscow Red Army maneuvers and public demonstrations states:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's performance of war preparations left a deep impression on people. What I cannot forget is the enthusiasm of the crowds throwing hats and cheering. When squadrons of airplanes performed stunts in the air, or a squadron of soldiers performed outstandingly, or giant armored vehicles appeared on the streets, the crowds often jumped with joy, forgetting their manners. This situation fully demonstrates the Soviet people's determination to defend against aggression. Another article describes the amazing changes in all aspects of the Soviet Union since 1922. Unexpected changes can be seen everywhere in the Soviet Union. The Red Army's uniform clothing, the cleanliness of Moscow's streets, the richness of family life, and even the development of large-scale industries are all greatly different from what we have always "known" about the country. On top of the barren wheat fields, large cities such as Menggnegorsk and Kerchnitz Trei have been built over the years. The reporter finally stated that the people of Poland should strive to understand the true situation of the Soviet Union, because this situation may have a great relationship with Poland.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 8th Congressman Tilson met with President Hoover today and predicted that if the Garner Bill is passed, it will be vetoed by the president. The bill calls for the allocation of US$200 million to build public works to relieve unemployment. It is also said that the Senate is unlikely to pass the bill in its current form. The Senate today passed an economic bill and replaced it with President Hoover's plan to suspend government pay during the holidays. The resolution to reduce pay by 10% for officials with annual salaries exceeding one thousand yuan is estimated to save between US$145 million and US$150 million each year. The proposal has been submitted to the House of Representatives before being presented to the President for signing, so that the House of Representatives can sort out the differences in interpretation of the bill between the Senate and the House of Representatives. Therefore, after the bill is passed, its approval can be obtained.</p>

<p>10,000 Camped in Washington</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 8th US veterans entitled to gratuities are now gradually gathering in Washington, DC. Large numbers arrived in the last two days. It is estimated that there are currently 10,000 camped on the banks of the Potomac River. According to their leader, their numbers will increase to 50,000 by the end of June, and they said they will never succumb to hunger. Today, these 10,000 veterans, dressed in rags, paraded in formation, asking people to pay attention to the gratuity vouchers that have not yet been paid. These people come from all over the country and are now camped in the fields. They were initially suffering from hot weather, but now it has turned cold, which has increased their hardship. Most of them have a yellow complexion and wear the cross medals of outstanding military achievements on their tattered military uniforms, and they hold tattered military flags. The public is shocked to see them. Among the 10,000 people, the most touching and pitiful case is a boy who is barely two years old, whose mother died of theft and lack of food. His father carries him and traveled 1,500 miles from Houston, Texas, to Washington, DC. These people have come to Washington to demand that the government pay gratuities, totaling approximately US$200 million. Congress has expressed sympathy for these people and may pass a proposal to grant their requests, but whether it can be implemented will depend on whether President Hoover agrees. Paying this gratuity voucher is tantamount to issuing more banknotes, so there is considerable opposition to it.</p>

<p>Totaling 3.2 Billion Rubles</p>
<p>Used to Conclude the First Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 8th The Soviet government is issuing domestic bonds worth 3,100,000,000 rubles in the name of the "Fourth Year and End Period of the Five-Year Plan", which will be repaid within ten years. The government claims that the development of domestic borrowing is closely related to the success of the first five-year plan. Last year, the government issued domestic bonds worth 1,600,000,000 rubles, and the people enthusiastically subscribed, exceeding the quota by 2 billion rubles. This debt is to complete the successful conclusion of the first five-year plan, and at the same time, it is a large-scale second five-year plan produced in response to the demands of workers in various factories and collective farms. The debt is divided into two types, one is interest-free lottery tickets, with bonuses drawn in installments over ten years, and the other is bonds with an interest rate of one percent, each bond is 100 rubles, divided into ten shares, lotteries.</p>
<p>The amount of the prize ranges from one hundred to three thousand rubles and is drawn four times a year.</p>

<p>Compatriots in the Northeast are in an extremely painful position</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese forces will inevitably be eliminated due to lack of support</p>
<p>Hoping that both the government and the public will quickly awaken and unite together</p>
<p>Ping News – The League of Nations Investigation Team returned to Ping yesterday. Mr. Gu Weijun, the representative of our country, spoke freely with news reporters from Ping City at the Foreign Affairs Building at 11:00 AM on the 6th regarding his recent trip to the East. The record is as follows: "The suffering of the people of the three northeastern provinces is beyond the imagination of the people within the pass. This suffering is entirely under oppression. The people of the eastern provinces love their country no less than the people within the pass.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Investigation Team travels by foreign car for a tour of the Beidaihe beach <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Even under these circumstances, their suffering can be seen everywhere. One day after returning to Fan from Harbin, there was a student sports meeting in front of the Yamato Hotel. There were thousands of students parading with Japanese and Manchurian flags. A large part of them were Japanese students, and the rest were Chinese students. When the flag-awarding ceremony was held, they sang the Manchurian national anthem and shouted 'Banzai!' However, all those singing were Japanese students, and their cheers were thunderous, while the Chinese students all hung their heads in despair. The delegation felt very distressed by this situation. One day, I was strolling in the park, and there were many students strolling in the park at the same time. They lingered for a long time, wanting to talk to me and tell me about the situation near Harbin. At this time, there were already three people following me. The three people behind me didn't look happy after the students said a few words. At that time, I stopped those students from continuing to speak and asked them to write it down and send it to me. They were very sad because the opportunity was rare or they didn't understand what I meant. Everyone can see that the 30 million people are now in a very painful and unfree position. It is really because the civil groups are not developed and free, and cannot develop a sound organization. Once something happens, they are completely disorganized and cannot have considerable effective ability. As for the main reason, we must say that the country usually does not pay attention to developing the spirit of the people and the methods of cooperation between the people. There are some who are really resisting there, and several soldiers are well-known to everyone, such as Ma Ding, Li, and Gong. They are fighting, with strong enemies in front and no assistance behind. The transportation is not in their own hands, and they cannot contact each other. However, their efforts to resist are giving the local people a chance to vent their anger. This kind of resistance is a resistance for tongue service, and the opponent is an army with a very complete organization, very complete equipment, and extremely powerful equipment. Every time there is a conflict, the enemy dies one and we always die ten. They are still resisting, and every day they are fighting to preserve the eastern province. A few dozen, dozens, or even hundreds die every day. We are very sad that we cannot help them with their sacrifices. The day before yesterday, I said that if this continues, China will inevitably be subjugated, and this is not alarmist talk.</p>

<p>The Chinese army that is resisting them has no support, while the other side has a whole organization and uses the power of the whole country as support. The Chinese army will be wiped out by them, but it is only a matter of time. Now they are like birds in a cage, doing whatever they want to ordinary people without guns. The media is completely controlled by them, and freedom of action is also restricted. In schools, all schools above the secondary level are occupied by the army. Although primary schools have classes, their textbooks have been revised by them. They have deleted everything that they don't want primary school students to know. This method is a thorough method of encroachment and a method of cutting grass and roots. After ten or five years, the relationship between the youth of the eastern provinces and China may be completely unclear. The so-called government agencies have presidents, ministers, and directors in name, and even though they are run by Chinese people, only one or two Japanese advisors can have full power. The matters to be handled must be approved by the advisor. They command as they please, but everything is done by the Chinese to show the world that it is an expression of public opinion. On the other hand, in terms of military affairs, they are clearing the forces of resistance and increasing divisions of the Japanese army. If the Japanese army is not enough, they are recruited from the local area. At the same time, they are actively carrying out political organizations, such as reorganizing financial matters, using the finances of the eastern provinces to support the troops who cause chaos in the eastern provinces. If this continues, the eastern provinces will soon not only completely break away from China, but will also become a source of aggression within the pass. The loss of the three northeastern provinces is said to be a national crisis, but it is only the beginning of the national crisis. If the eastern provinces are completely lost, the same danger can occur in the northwest and southwest. Everyone must know the danger of the position they are in, and no one should boast empty words anymore. They must do it in a practical way. In the 20th century, the survival of a country depends entirely on real strength. China's vast land and large population are by no means a guarantee. We should redouble our efforts to build the country.</p>

<p>If other countries use ten points of strength, we must use thirty or forty points of strength to achieve the same progress. What does the country look like now? Internationally, people think our country is scattered and chaotic. One side is fighting, and the other side is negotiating peace. The government is breaking off relations with Russia, and the local government is establishing consulates with Russia. Other unsound situations exist everywhere. I hope that the whole country, whether in or out of the government, will take the country as the prerequisite. If the country is prosperous and strong, the people can all be citizens of a strong country. If the country cannot do well on its own, it may even perish. At that time, both jade and stone will be burned together and everyone will die together. I hope the Chinese people wake up, understand the current danger, find a new way, unite the whole country, follow this road together, make the country strong, and preserve its due position in the world. Although the above is full of emotion, it is all what the conscience wants to say. There is no prejudice whatsoever. I always hope that everything will be based on the country as the premise, so that the territory can be preserved, and the 400 million compatriots will not have the pain of being subjugated."</p>

<h3 id="e103">Coming to Hankou to supervise the suppression of bandits <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Telegraphic order to the Pacification Headquarters: All recovered bandit areas must be treated with compassion and those who were coerced must be forgiven</p>
<p>He Chengjun issued a general order to the bandit suppression troops, urging them with three matters</p>
<p>Qian Zhuolun indicated that the General Headquarters will be set up in Bengbu</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: It has been rumored for a long time that Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, who also serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, will come to Hankou to supervise the army. After receiving the news, He Chengjun, head of the Pacification Headquarters, immediately borrowed the Bankers Association as his headquarters and began preparations. He also ordered Ye Peng, the commander of the garrison, to maintain strict vigilance. The roads near the headquarters were also being repaired, and tattered slogans on the walls were torn down and washed clean. Other welcome ceremonies were all simplified. On the 4th of this month, Yu Feipeng, Huang Zhenxing, Lu Zuolin, Lin Xiang and others arrived in Hankou on the Jiangjing end. On the 5th, Qian Zhuolun, the chief of staff, and Chen Xizeng, the chief of general affairs, also led personnel from the general headquarters on the Jiangtian Wheel. However, Commander-in-Chief Chiang had not yet left for the festival in Beijing. On the 7th, a telegram was received from Nanjing stating that Chiang had already left on the Yingrui warship westward at 5:00 PM on the same day with his wife, Ms. Song Meiling, and guard Wang Shihe. The Yongshui warship followed as escort. On the 8th, another telegram was received from Anhui stating that they had arrived in Anqing at 1:00 PM. Wu Zhongxin, the chairman of Anhui, boarded the ship to greet them. They soon set sail and are scheduled to make a slight stop when they arrive in Jiujiang. According to naval news, Minister He Yingqin went from Nanchang to Xun and had consultations with Chiang. If he does not stay for long, he will arrive in Hankou before noon on the 9th. All the generals in Hankou are staying here to welcome him, and those in the defense areas will also come to Hankou to receive instructions. As for whether Chiang will be stationed in Hankou after arriving, or go to the front to supervise the army, or return to Nanking, it probably depends on the convening of a military conference and the bandit situation. However, according to Qian Zhuolun, the general headquarters plans to set up the central station of the Jinpu Road,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Bengbu is the most suitable. Working in Hankou is temporary in nature, and the name is General Headquarters. He also said that Commander-in-Chief Chiang will come to Hankou to inspect and summon senior military officers, give face-to-face instructions, and then go to Henan via the Pinghan Road, and then to Anhui via the Longhai Road Jinpu Road. Whether this will be the case in the future remains to be proven by facts. As for bandit suppression in Hubei Province, it is currently going smoothly. Bandit areas are being recovered day by day. Post-war matters are being handled separately by the Pacification Headquarters, the Bandit Suppression Propaganda and Consolation Committee, the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs, the Qingxiang Association, and the Post-War Association. Commander-in-Chief Chiang also telegraphed the Pacification Headquarters to take good care of the comforting, and those who were coerced to become bandits should be exempted from implication. The original telegram stated: "Since the Red bandits have been causing trouble, the rural system has been completely destroyed, the people's property has been completely filled with bandits, the good people are afraid of fleeing, vagrants are either threatened or driven, the villages are deserted, and the fields are desolate. The suffering is really sad. In the future, all recovered areas should be treated with compassion and consolation. All those who were coerced should be exempted from implication," etc. After receiving the telegram, He Chengjun issued a general order to the various armies on the 8th to comply with it. At the same time, he ordered the various armies to pay attention to three matters during the tense period of bandit suppression. The original order stated: "In order to follow the orders, the way of governing the army is to focus on training. The spirit of training is to be constant. In the past, the Prime Minister was in Guangxi, and he gave lectures to the armies of Yunnan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi on military spirit education. In addition to elaborating on the three things of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, he repeatedly emphasized the two words 'determination'. Determination means being able to be constant. For soldiers, training is like daily diet for life. They cannot be separated from them in times of urgency. Diligent training can turn weak soldiers into strong soldiers. Neglecting training can turn restraint into a mob. Therefore, soldiers cannot be unprepared for a day, and they cannot be unprepared for a day. The various troops stationed in Hubei have been suppressing bandits for many years and have been fighting hard. They are still able to plan and consider both training and implementation at any time. However, there are also those who only consider one thing and lose the other, and abandon it as if it were lost. During this tense period of work, I have specially stipulated three items below regarding the urgent need to rectify and easy to implement, for your reference and follow-up. (1) Rectify military discipline. It is known that military discipline is the lifeblood of the army. This is something that all soldiers know, and they should always keep it in mind and not neglect it for a moment. Recently, the national treasury has been empty, the source of military pay has not been continuous, and the roads have been blocked and transportation has been difficult. Therefore, the various armies inevitably have the practice of collecting materials directly from the local area. It must be known that our people have already suffered the tragic disaster of the Red bandits, and they have also been subjected to the demands of the army. The burden is too heavy, and they are unable to supply. Therefore, there are complaints such as 'the bandits pass like a comb, and the soldiers pass like a wash'. The military and the people hate each other, and the accumulation cannot be calmed down. For the Red bandits, there are forgiving words. Once the people's hearts are gone, it will be difficult to appease them. They should be treated with compassion by the senior officers of each army, division, and brigade, and they should take care to rest and reassure the people. All matters such as preparing supplies, occupying civilian houses, and forcibly pulling civilian husbands are not the proper behavior of the army. If there are other methods that can be replaced, they must be avoided as much as possible. It must not be done in a willful manner, taking and demanding as desired, causing public resentment. In addition, arrogance and complacency are also to be suspended as strict prohibitions to maintain the military's reputation and maintain the relationship between the military and the people. (2) Pay attention to practical education. It is known that the Red bandits' whereabouts are unpredictable, and their gatherings and dispersals are impermanent. Moreover, they use traitors to transmit messages, which is extremely sensitive. Therefore, if you want to control the opportunity, you must quickly deploy troops. Traveling a hundred miles a day is more likely to win than traveling fifty miles a day. In the future, if our bandit suppression troops can get a little free time, they should immediately focus on training. For running, climbing mountains, and other actions such as marching urgently and marching strongly, they must practice diligently at all times and in all places, so as to develop a strong marching force, so that they can quickly rush to the scene once they encounter a bandit police, and not lose the opportunity. As for shooting methods and shooting discipline, they must be diligently taught and practiced effectively, so that every bullet will be fired without fail and orders will be carried out thoroughly, which is the most important. (3) Help the people to defend themselves. The army and the people should be integrated into one. If we get one people, the bandits will lose one people. If we lose one people, the bandits will get one people. It has been found that every time the bandit suppression results are achieved, if the military and the people can cooperate, the results will be more effective, otherwise it will be doomed to failure. Now, the counties and towns have established militias and organized self-defense, which are originally to supplement the deficiencies of the army, and should be supported for assistance. However, there are occasionally military personnel who do not understand the overall situation and specialize in recruiting militias or raising militia guns as their ability. This kind of action is tantamount to chasing sparrows for a bush, driving fish for a pond, cutting off one's own wings, increasing the strength of the bandits, and committing suicide, which is extremely dangerous. In the future, it must be strictly prohibited, and in the recovered areas, we must do our best to help the people and step up the handling of the regiment defense, so that the farmers and shepherds are all strong soldiers, and the hoes and thorns are all weapons. If this can be done, then on the one hand, the bandits can be restrained from looting, and on the other hand, they can be prevented from transferring and escaping. And on the side of the army, on the one hand, they can remotely support them, and on the other hand, they can avoid worries. It is a great convenience to get several benefits at once. Hu Runzhi's so-called using the people to defend the people, so that the bandits have nowhere to enter, is what he meant. The above three items are all important current plans. In addition to distributing the order, you must urge your subordinates to implement it carefully, and do not treat it as a mere formality. This is the most important. This order." (June 8)</p>

<h3 id="e104">Bandit Forces on the Border of the Three Provinces <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Zhu De's main force gathers in Changting and on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian</p>
<p>Mao Zedong leads peasant bandits to occupy southeastern Jiangxi</p>
<p>Peng Dehuai attempts to bypass the Hunan border and return to Jinggang</p>
<p>Kong Hechong still haunts eastern Hunan and western Jiangxi</p>
<p>Fang Zhimin's group is active again in northeastern Jiangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: There are currently five pseudo-military corps of Red bandits in the five southeastern provinces, namely, one Zhu De, two He Long, three Peng Dehuai, four Li Mingrui, and five Ji Zhentong. Among these bandits, Zhu De's strength is the strongest. The pseudo-Fourth Army of Lin Biao, the Twelfth Army of Luo Binghui, and the Eighth Army of Xiang Ying are all under his command. The next is He Long. All the bandits on the border of Hubei, Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, and Hubei and Henan are under his command. The next is Peng Dehuai. All of the Kong Hechong's pseudo-Sixteenth Army in eastern Hunan and on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi are under his control. Li and Ji's forces are the weakest. According to front-line news, Li was assassinated, and his troops were taken over by Peng. Ji was in western Fujian and was designated by Zhu De as the AB regiment, arrested and killed, and disarmed and reorganized, but this has not yet been confirmed. After Zhu De withdrew from Zhangzhou, his main force concentrated in western Fujian and the area of ​​Changting Ancient City on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian. Zhu himself led pseudo-military agencies such as the Pseudo-Military First Army Group to be stationed in Ting for command. It is heard that the stock is stationed in Ting, and its attempts to invade Guangdong and Jiangxi are unclear, but due to the oppression of the Fujian and Guangdong armies, it will inevitably flee back to southeastern Jiangxi Province. Guangchang, Shicheng, Ruijin, Huichang, Xunwu, Yudu, Xingguo, and Ningdu in southeastern Jiangxi Province have not been recovered since last year's Hu Zu Wang and Shangguan Yun and other troops failed one after another and were re-occupied. Important bandit nests such as Longgang, Donggu, Tengtian, Huangpi, Xiaobu, Shima, Nakamur, and Gaoxingxu have all been restored to the state of Red bandit occupation. After Zhu's bandits entered Fujian, Mao Zedong stayed behind in the above areas to preside over everything. Mao used local peasant bandits as the basic team, which was very weak and could not leave the original defense area. Therefore, he is vigorously carrying out redification in the local area, confiscating land, houses, and other tasks. Most of Peng's troops were natives of eastern Hunan. The pseudo-Fifty-seventh and Fifty-eighth Armies once attacked Rugui and then attacked Jilong. They were defeated by the Wang Dongyuan, Liu Shaoxian, and Li Ming troops. They are now attempting to bypass the borders of eastern Hunan and ​​Guangxi and flee back to the old bandit areas of Jinggang in Ninggang, Yongxin, Suichuan, Lianhua, Guidong, Lingxian, Chaling, and Youxian. In recent days, bandits in Lianhua and Yongxin have been very active, which is not without reason. The Kong Hechong's pseudo-Sixteenth Army in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan has three divisions, the pseudo-Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth, plus the Guards Division that Peng Dehuai allocated when he was in Hunan. There are a total of two to three thousand guns. After being severely suppressed by Guo Rudong, Xie Bin, and Tao Guangluo Lin in Tongshan, Tongcheng, and Yangxin in Hubei, they fled to Zhajin Macao area at the junction of Xiushui and Pingjiang, and planned to enter Hunan to join Peng's bandits. The Red bandits in eastern Jiangxi were the Fang Zhimin Shao Shisheng and other groups. Since 1927, they have taken Mopan Mountain at the junction of Yiyang and Hengfeng as their lair, causing trouble on the border of Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui. All the counties under Guangxin and Raozhou have been ravaged. Last year, Jiang Dingwen, Xu Tingyao and other troops destroyed their old nest. The number of guns left by the group was less than one thousand. However, at the end of last year, a certain division collapsed, losing many guns, and the bandit forces surged again. Later, when Jiang's division moved to Hangzhou and Ruan's division returned to Anhui, Fang Shao took the opportunity to lead his pseudo-Tenth Army Zhou Jianping and the Peasant Self-Defense Army to capture Hengfeng, surround Dexing, disturb Leping, invade Qianshan, and even invaded Yujiang. Later, they were repelled by Li's division and Dai's brigade, but the poisoning of Yiyang, Guixi, and Guangfeng has not yet been eliminated. It is now heard that He Yingqin has transferred a certain division of Zhou's troops from eastern Jiangxi to the northwest, a certain division of Jiang's troops from Zhejiang to Shangrao, and a certain division of Li's troops will take a pincer attack with Jiang and Zhou, changing defense to attack. At the same time, he ordered the police teams of more than a dozen counties in the old three prefectures of Fuzhou, Guangxin, and Raozhou to concentrate their forces and launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression. Therefore, the suppression of bandits in that area is progressing gradually and actively (June 6).</p>

<h3 id="e105">Strict Bandit Suppression and Qingxiang <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The remnants of the bandits in northern Shandong are gradually being suppressed</p>
<p>A misunderstanding occurred with Liu Guitang's troops</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuju, chairman of the provincial government, plans to either recruit or suppress the remnants of bandits in southern and northern Shandong in the near future, in order to completely resolve them and expedite the Qingxiang. The remnants of the bandits in northern Shandong have been searched and suppressed by Sun Tongxuan, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression, leading Zhang Shulin of the Fifty-eighth Brigade, Li Hanzhang of the Eighty-fifth Brigade, and various troops, together with Zhao Renquan of the Northern Shandong Militia. The remnants of the bandits in Pingyuan heard the news and fled far away. They are now jointly suppressing the remnants of Xia Zhun. Hand-to-hand inspection Brigade Commander Lei Taiping also received an order at 2:00 PM today (7th) to take a camp of special service soldiers and ride the Taishan steel armored vehicle to northern Shandong to assist in the suppression. Li Shuchun, the deputy commander of bandit suppression and director of the Department of Civil Affairs, has been visiting Pingyuan, Dezhou, Yucheng, Encheng, and other places to inspect, summoning district chiefs, township chiefs, and town chiefs, to inform them of the meaning of truly suppressing bandits and exposing bandit classes in order to permanently eliminate bandit tracks. As for the western Shandong region, the giant bandits Zhang Heilian, Wang Changyou, and Li Douyin have requested to surrender and have been approved. They have been ordered to gather in Nan Shahe and prepare a column of empty cars to be sent to Yucheng for verification and reorganization. However, the bandits are located at different distances, with two to three thousand people, and it takes time to gather. Therefore, as of today, they have not yet gathered at the designated location. Counselor You Ziming and Deputy Director Meng Guangshan, who are handling this matter, are also in the mountains, supervising their gathering and resolving to complete the gathering in the near future and transport them to Yucheng for verification and reorganization. Han Fuju hopes that the bandits can be suppressed, and yesterday he specially established strict assessment of bandit suppression for the county magistrates. If a gun case is found once, a demerit will be recorded, if it is found twice, a major demerit will be recorded, and if it is found three times, the county magistrate will be dismissed. The telegram is as follows: "All county magistrates are aware that the banditry in various counties has been rampant recently, and robberies and kidnappings have been frequently heard. This chairman is concerned about the people's difficulties and cannot sleep peacefully. For the sake of truly supervising and urging, a special assessment has been established. The county magistrates are responsible for the local affairs and cannot shirk their responsibilities. Each must supervise and cooperate with the chiefs of the public security bureaus and the deputy captains of the militia to truly investigate and if the city and countryside are robbed or kidnapped. If the county magistrate is still negligent in war and defense, the county magistrate in charge will be given a demerit once, a major demerit twice, and a dismissal if more than three times. If the case is solved within half a month, the punishment will be revoked. If they dare to conceal the case and fail to report it, they will be severely punished upon verification. In addition to ordering them to comply, they are hereby informed in advance, and they must all be respected."</p>
<p>Also, Sun Tongxuan and Li Shuchun recently received orders to lead troops to northern Shandong to suppress bandits and clear the countryside in order to pacify the local area. Unexpectedly, the Shandong Garrison Army Liu Guitang, Guo Wensheng, Yin Shixi and other troops stationed in Gaotang and Yaozhan, because they were originally recruited from bandits, had a misunderstanding and alarmed each other, suspecting that the authorities intended to resolve them. Therefore, on the 6th, they surrounded the Gaotang militia, disarmed them, and tricked the county magistrate Zhang Kebao into expelling him from the country. Sun Li immediately reported the situation to Han Fuju and prepared everything, while still comforting them in order to avoid the corruption of the local area. Xu Peichan, the director of Liu Guitang's office in Jinan, also fled because of this incident. The remaining personnel have been captured separately by the Jinan Garrison Command. However, according to Han Fuju, after Liu Guitang and other troops were recruited, their military pay and all other treatments were the same as those of the Third Route Army. Unexpectedly, Liu still forced Shangtang Sixian to borrow money. The original intention of bandit suppression in northern Shandong this time was to pacify the local area. Liu Guitang was guilty and had a misunderstanding and alarmed each other. Now the army is ready, but he still hopes that he will realize his mistake and submit, otherwise he will only have to suppress him severely (7th).</p>

<p>Inspection of the Report from the Director of the Finance Department to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Annual Deficit Exceeds 1.3 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Hoping for Sino-Russian Restoration of Relations to Alleviate the Situation</p>
<p>Wen Guang, the Director of the Finance Department of Chahar Province, recently submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance regarding the financial situation of the entire Chahar Province. The report stated that the annual deficit reached over 1.36 million yuan. The only way to alleviate the situation is to restore Sino-Russian relations, thereby reopening the Zhangjiakou-Kulun trade. The report also provided a detailed description of the terrain and the people's economy of Chahar Province. The report read, "I have received your Ministry's decree No. 113, instructing me to comply. The Ministry has the legal responsibility to supervise the local finances of all provinces and cities. It is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the revenue and expenditure surpluses and deficits, as well as methods of rectification, in order to have a comprehensive and accurate view. The Finance Department's revenue and expenditure situation, whether it is surplus or deficit, whether the existing tax sources can be improved, whether the various economic expenditures can be reduced, and how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure to achieve a balance, must be reported in detail within twenty days after the receipt of this document. This matter concerns the major plan of financial rectification and should be properly handled. I have already issued separate orders. I hereby order you to comply without delay, etc." After investigation, Chahar is located in the central part of Inner Mongolia, with deserts running across it. The south of the desert is the territory of the Eight Banners of the Chahar Department, as well as the four pastoral groups of Mian, Shangdu, Left Wing, and Right Wing. The north of the desert is the territory of the five leagues and ten banners of the Xilingol League. The land of the Mongolian people in each banner has always been managed by the princes of each banner. However, Dolon is a place for trade between the Han and Mongolians, and it is also a necessary route for travelers from Rehe Zhangjiakou to Kulun. When Kulun is open, business is very prosperous. Zhangjiakou and Dushikou are strategically located border passes for a long time, serving as thoroughfares for the entry and exit of Han and Mongolian people. Zhangjiakou is also a central hub for the trade of goods between the Han and Mongolians. Therefore, the Qing Dynasty established three offices to govern it, which were subordinate to the Koubei Road of Hebei Province. In the spring of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the ten counties of Koubei were劃劃歸 Chahar Province, and the five counties of Xinghe, Fengzhen, Jining, Taolin, and Liangcheng, which were previously under Chahar Province, were transferred to Suiyuan. The current jurisdiction of Chahar Province is the territory of one county and three offices formerly under Koubei Road. This is the actual situation of the administrative region. In addition, during the Qing Dynasty, the various parts of Inner Mongolia were divided into governors and generals to intimidate their princes without interfering in their internal affairs, originally to show appeasement. The Chahar Governor did not reside within the territory of Chahar, but in Zhangjiakou, Hebei. Also, because he did not interfere in their internal affairs, and the Mongolian people lived by nomadism, moving with the water and grass, there was no land tax income to provide for government expenses. Zhangjiakou is adjacent to Chahar, being an important road for Inner and Outer Mongolia to enter Beijing, and a market for Russian and Mongolian goods. Collecting taxes on goods is sufficient to meet the needs of political and military expenditures, and the situation in Chahar is also easy to understand. This is the original intention of the Chahar Governor residing in Zhangjiakou. Although the four pastoral areas were opened up for cultivation in the early years of the Republic of China, the land is located on a plateau, close to the desert, with dry air and little rainfall, which is not suitable for farming. The cultivated land has been abandoned, and the whole area is desolate. Therefore, after eighteen or nineteen years of cultivation, it is still desolate. Traveling in the area, one often does not see any signs of human habitation for dozens of miles. At present, Zhangbei County is the former Zhangjiakou Office, Guyuan is the former Dushikou Office, and Dolon is the former Dolon Nur Office. Zhangbei and Guyuan are close to the border wall. In addition to farming and animal husbandry, there are also transportation and other industries that can be used to make a living. Therefore, it is not a completely desolate area. Dolon relies entirely on commerce and transportation, and there is almost no agriculture to speak of. As for Baochang, Kangbao, and Shangdu, the three counties were changed from the management bureaus of the reclaimed land. Due to years of famine, farmers have fled, and the population has decreased year by year. At present, each of the three counties has more than a thousand households and more than ten thousand people. Although they are called counties, they are actually not as good as the larger villages and towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The cultivated land that has been taxed can collect 50% in a year of good harvest, and less than 10% in a year of famine. This is the situation of the land tax population in the six counties outside the pass. Although the land tax in the ten counties of Koubei is not much, the actual collection is more than 90%. Therefore, although the total tax amount of the province is more than 600,000 yuan, the actual collection is only more than 480,000 yuan over the years. Last year was a bumper harvest, and the income was only 589,300 yuan. Therefore, land tax is the main source of local tax, but Chahar Province is an exception. The main tax source of this province has always relied on the Likin tax on goods entering and leaving Kulun. In the past, during prosperous times, the goods going to and from Zhangjiakou and Kulun reached about 70 million yuan each year, totaling about 140 million yuan. If 3% is levied, the Likin tax could collect more than 4 million yuan. After the Likin tax was abolished, the sales tax levied exclusively on imported goods could also yield about 2 million yuan, combined with local taxes such as brokerage tax and land tax, about 2.7 million yuan. Adding the national tax of 1 million yuan, the revenue and expenditure could be offset. Since the winter of the 18th year, Sino-Russian relations have deteriorated, and Kulun has been blockaded. Goods sent there are not allowed to be sold, goods that have been processed are not allowed to be transported back, and money from sales is not allowed to leave the country. Merchants returning to Zhangjiakou are restricted to bring back travel expenses of 200 yuan per person. It is estimated that the losses suffered by our merchants in Kulun amounted to about 60 million yuan. Since then, the commerce of Zhangjiakou has been in a slump, and many merchants have gone bankrupt. Financial institutions have been implicated and closed down. The customs duties and local taxes of Zhangjiakou have also been sharply reduced. At present, the goods entering and leaving Zhangjiakou are only limited to Inner Mongolia. The central area of the Inner Mongolia desert does not have abundant water and grass, and livestock are not prosperous. The value of goods entering and leaving each year is about 100,000 yuan each. When Jin Fang was in charge of Chahar, he was already suffering from insufficient income, so in addition to the production tax, he also levied brokerage tax, increasing the tax rate to be equal to the production tax, and transferring it to the provincial treasury. In the past, the county and local funds were allocated by the tax bureau to the county finance bureaus according to the original amount, totaling 135,500 yuan per year. It is estimated that the total local tax revenue for the previous year was 2,900,690 yuan. After deducting the funds retained by the county and local governments, the actual revenue was 2,771,300 yuan, which, combined with the national tax, totaled 3,763,000 yuan. This is the general situation of national and local revenue in the 20th year. In terms of expenditure, the provincial expenditure, excluding the funds retained by the counties and local governments, was actually 2,242,500 yuan in the 20th year, and the national expenditure was 1,394,500 yuan, totaling 3,737,100 yuan, leaving a balance of 25,900 yuan. This year's provincial government expenditure, starting from February, has been reduced to 1,728,500 yuan for the whole year, a reduction of 613,800 yuan compared to last year. The national tax financial expenses have been consolidated and reduced, saving 133,380 yuan. The two combined savings total 747,250 yuan. This year's military expenditure is 300,000 yuan per month, an increase of 2.4 million yuan compared to last year. It is estimated that the provincial government expenses will be 1,728,650 yuan,</p>
<p>The allocation of military expenditure is 3.6 million yuan, the national tax administrative expenses are 60,550 yuan, and the expenses for the Zhangjiakou relay station are 6,660 yuan. It is estimated that the national expenditure totals 3,667,220 yuan, and the two combined total 5,395,870 yuan. Last year's national and local tax revenue totaled 3,763,060 yuan. The revenue for this year has not started for long. According to the tax revenue for March, it is not as good as the same month last year. The prosperity of tax revenue depends entirely on the stability of the situation and the abundance of the year's harvest, which is difficult to predict. I will use last year's revenue as the budget for this year's revenue. The amount of revenue and expenditure deficit has reached 1,632,810 yuan. This is the actual situation of the inability to balance revenue and expenditure. As for increasing revenue, it has reached the point of exhausting the pond to catch fish and taking advantage of every opportunity. In the old Koubei Road, which is the poorest area with 10 counties and 3 offices, with a population of only 1.9 million, the local tax revenue reaches 2,771,300 yuan, with an average burden of 1.5 yuan per person per year, compared to the famous rich provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, where the average burden per person per year is no more than 1 yuan. In the most barren and bitter area, the burden of the people is more than half that of the people in rich areas. It can be seen that the people's strength has been exhausted, and there is no source to be exploited. The only way is to restore Sino-Russian relations, so that the Zhangjiakou-Kulun trade can be restored, and the sales tax can be levied on imported goods to make up for the shortage of military expenditure. As for reducing expenditure, the provincial government expenditure was 186,870 yuan per month last spring. In the 7th year, it was difficult to make ends meet due to insufficient military expenditure. After the establishment of the Beiping Financial Consolidation Committee, a financial meeting was convened in January of this year. After discussion, it was decided to reduce the number of institutions, and those that remained would also reduce their expenses. It is estimated that the Chahar provincial expenditure would be reduced by 51,150 yuan per month, starting from February. The monthly government expenditure was reduced to 144,050 yuan, including education, construction, law, science, police, and Mongolian Banner expenses, about 78,490 yuan. The actual expenses for provincial government, county government, and finance are only 65,560 yuan. Therefore, there is no room for further reduction. I respectfully report the huge financial deficit in Chahar Province and submit the comparison table of revenue and expenditure in the 20th year, the statistics table of national and local tax revenue, the statistics table of national and local expenditure, and the budget table of national and local expenditure for this year for your inspection. As for how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure to balance the deficit of 1,632,810 yuan, I respectfully request your wise plan for guidance and implementation. I am extremely grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e107">The Waters of the Three Rivers in Guangdong Province Surge <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The North River is Most Dangerous</p>
<p>The Roadbed of the Shao-Ping Road is in Danger of Being Breached</p>
<p>The Military Bridge in Shaoguan City is Washed Away</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the beginning of summer, various parts of Guangdong Province have suffered from drought. It was not until the end of last month that it began to rain heavily. However, the days have been overcast and the rain has not stopped. As a result, the areas that have suffered from drought are now reporting floods. Due to the continuous torrential rains in recent days, the mountain torrents in various places have risen sharply. The North River and the East and West Rivers have experienced large floods. The discharge of water is not timely, resulting in accumulated floods that inundate the banks along the river. The most severely affected area is the North River. The mountain range in the upper reaches of the North River is winding. The mountain torrents pour down, and the land is almost navigable by boats. According to reports, the roadbed of the Shao-Ping Road has been breached in seven or eight places, with the water depth on the road surface reaching five or six feet, making transportation extremely difficult. When the floodwaters reached Shaoguan City, the streets were also flooded to a depth of one foot. The North River is the confluence of the Qujiang, Lechang, Shixing, and Renhua tributaries. The water level is seven feet higher than usual. The river is turbulent, like thousands of horses galloping. The military bridge outside the South Gate of Shaoguan City was suddenly washed away by the water a few days ago. The bridge planks floated with the waves. Fortunately, the bridge boat quickly cut the cables and set sail, retrieving the bridge planks. The next day, workers were dispatched to repair it, and transportation was restored. Currently, the North River Defense Army, recognizing the importance of transportation during this military period, has strictly ordered local people to prepare for flood control works to avoid temporary chaos. For precautionary measures, the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau has sent engineers to inspect the roadbed of the Yuehan Railway line along with the road workers. If any places are found to be flooded, they will be repaired immediately to prevent accidents. Special attention is paid to the confluence of the Xunjiang and Lianjiang rivers. Due to the torrential rains in Qingyuan and Yingde in recent days, the floodwaters have also risen sharply. The floodwaters have washed away the rice fields in the downstream areas of Chini and Baini. As for the East River, Haifeng and Lufeng previously suffered from drought. Unexpectedly, the water of the East River has rushed down from Laolong and Longchuan in recent days. The water level in the northeastern downstream areas has suddenly risen by more than five feet. Various places were caught off guard, resulting in considerable losses. It has been found that the Juhu Pavilion in Laolong and Liujie in Heyuan, the Mijie Street and various markets in Huiyang, the county seat of Boluo, and the Dongxi and Luyuan Streets in Shilong, Dongguan,</p>
<p>All became submerged. If the weather does not clear up, the floods in the east will continue to lengthen. As for the West River, although the water level has risen, it is not as dangerous as the North River. However, low-lying areas along the river, such as Zhaoqing, Fengchuan, Sanshui, and Shunde, have been flooded. Moreover, the river is turbulent, and the waters of Genzhu Shoal in Shunde are particularly dangerous. Navigation is very cautious, and many ships have changed their routes to prevent accidents. The counties along the river, in view of the floods of previous years, are now rushing to repair the embankments, and the construction work is very busy. (June 6)</p>
<h3 id="e108">Qingdao Hailstorm Disaster <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Hail also fell in Jiaoxian, and the Harvest of Wheat and Barley is Hopeless</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: The weather in this city has been cold and hot recently. At about 11:00 am on the 5th of this month, thick clouds suddenly rose and filled the sky. At first, there was a downpour of rain and thunder and lightning, followed by a strong wind and hail. The hailstones were as small as pigeon eggs, medium-sized ones were like walnuts, and the largest ones were like chicken eggs. In a dense state, one could only see hail</p>
<p>and not rain. The ground was instantly covered in white, with a thick layer of about an inch. It stopped after more than 30 minutes. The accumulated water on the road submerged the knees. The telephone lines inside and outside the city were also destroyed and could not be connected. Many of the electric light bulbs on both sides of the road were broken. It was truly a strange disaster. According to</p>
<p>The Qingdao Observatory's news, due to the Mongolian high-pressure air attacking from Liaodong to Shandong and the Sea of Japan, this extremely dramatic change occurred. According to people from Jiaoxian, hail also fell in the county and the Haixi area on the 5th at the same time. It was the time when the two wheat crops were about to ripen, and the seedlings were all over the fields. Suddenly, after this hailstorm, all the crops and wheat seedlings were in a mess. The harvest is hopeless. Therefore, the farmers there are all crying out in pain. (June 6)</p>

<p>Regulations of the Ministry of Education</p>
<h3 id="e120">Matters to be specially emphasized in moral education in primary and secondary schools in the future <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has stipulated the matters that should be specially emphasized in the moral education of primary and secondary schools in the future and issued a notice to the education departments of various provinces and cities:</p>
<p>Recently, our country is facing internal and external troubles, like water getting deeper and deeper, like fire getting hotter and hotter. If we do not seek remedy quickly, the future of the nation will be unimaginable. Primary and secondary school education is related to the foundation of the country and the nation. In this extraordinary period, teachers should share the crisis and intensify their work. Special attention should be paid to the moral education of students, so as to clearly identify the goals, use methods, and supervise young people and children, inspire their spirit, and vow to prepare for shame and national salvation. It is absolutely impossible to be lax or abandon one's duties. The Ministry has formulated the "Matters to be specially emphasized in moral education of primary and secondary schools in the future" as the standard for training students. I hereby order you to forward it to your subordinates to comply with it and urge the departments to supervise it at any time to see the results. This order,</p>
<h3 id="e121">Matters Requiring Special Attention in Moral Education for Primary and Secondary Schools Going Forward <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>(I) Training Objectives</p>
<p>Should promote the inherent virtues of our nation: loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, peace, etc. Simultaneously, special attention should be paid to:</p>
<p>(I) Vigorously eradicating cowardice and complacency, cultivating a spirit of bravery and striving.</p>
<p>(II) Vigorously eradicating dependence and perfunctoriness, cultivating the ability to be independent and responsible.</p>
<p>(III) Vigorously eradicating rashness and blind obedience, cultivating careful and thorough thinking.</p>
<p>(IV) Vigorously eradicating romanticism and extravagance, cultivating habits of diligence and thrift.</p>
<p>(V) Vigorously eradicating hypocrisy and disunity, cultivating a spirit of sincerity and solidarity.</p>
<p>(VI) Vigorously eradicating selfishness and self-interest, cultivating concepts of patriotism and love for the community.</p>
<h3 id="e122">(II) Moral Education Responsibility <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>(I) All teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools must earnestly share the responsibility for moral education, breaking down the accumulated bad habits of separating teaching from moral education. Each should formulate a comprehensive plan based on the relevant aspects of moral education and teaching in their respective schools, in preparation for division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>(II) All teachers and staff must have a thorough understanding of the current national crisis and must constantly remind students of it through various suggestive methods.</p>
<p>(III) All teachers and staff must live a life of hardship and endurance, practicing personality cultivation through example.</p>
<p>(IV) In addition to paying attention to leadership in training, all teachers and staff should fully utilize teaching opportunities (such as in language, mathematics, history, geography, natural science, social studies, physical education, etc.) to enhance students' systematic understanding and motivation for national humiliation and national salvation.</p>
<p>(V) Primary and secondary schools must hold morning assemblies every morning for short periods of instruction. The principal, teachers, staff, and students must all attend.</p>
<h3 id="e123">(III) Environmental Equipment <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>(I) Comparative tables of the population of China and foreign countries, as well as their land, sea, and air forces; comparative tables of education levels; and other various comparative tables.</p>
<p>(II) Maps of national humiliation, chronological tables of national humiliation, statistical charts of losses suffered in the national crisis, detailed before-and-after maps of places where the national crisis occurred, books and illustrations recording Sino-Japanese negotiations, and other materials related to the national crisis.</p>
<p>(III) Illustrations of historical events of our nation's national movements; illustrations of historical events of national movements in various countries in the modern world; and acts of bravery of the national army and volunteer armies in resisting the enemy in this national crisis, and others.</p>
<p>The above three items, (I), (II), and (III), are necessary materials for inspiring and encouraging. How to collect, compile, and set them up should be connected with teaching.</p>
<p>(IV) Spacious and healthy fitness venues, military training equipment (junior high schools and primary schools should enrich the equipment for Boy Scout training), physics and chemistry instruments, and specimens.</p>
<p>(Those who can make them themselves must do so).</p>
<h3 id="e124">(IV) Implementation Methods <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Regarding physical education: 1. Senior high schools should implement strict military training, focusing on outdoor practical exercises. Students who fail military training should not be allowed to graduate. Junior high schools should intensify Boy Scout training, and primary schools should focus on Boy Scout training and health exercises. 2. Emphasize various group sports, national martial arts, and indigenous recreational games and sports from various regions.</p>
<p>Regarding community education: Guide students to organize self-governing bodies, cultivate group life, and emphasize strict organization to vigorously restrict individual freedom. Particular attention should be paid to cultivating habits of obedience and mutual assistance. The freedom of the nation and the people must be sought, and individual freedom must be abandoned. Seeking individual freedom within a group is selfish and self-serving.</p>
<p>Regarding intellectual education: 1. Emphasize scientific research, experiments, competitions, and achievement exhibitions. 2. Debates, speeches, and expressions of opinions should focus on the facts of national humiliation and national salvation. 3. Various research societies should focus on the status of our country's production and various national defense equipment issues. 4. Collect and display separately the necessary domestic products for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. 5. Research methods for identifying domestic and inferior goods. 6. Reports and investigations of important current events.</p>
<p>Regarding moral education: 1. Practice a life of hardship and endurance, reducing internal school labor. All labor must be jointly undertaken by teachers and students. 2. Save on banquets, refreshments, and snack expenses. 3. Promote the use of domestic goods. 4. Strictly prohibit romantic, ostentatious extravagance. 5. Take an oath to avenge national humiliation and save the nation, and train students to identify the career they should pursue in the future to prepare for saving the country and the nation. 6. At important gatherings, observe a moment of silence to mourn the compatriots who died in the national crisis.</p>
<p>The above four items are intended for both primary and secondary schools. In addition to the common necessities that must be paid attention to, each primary school should adjust the proportion of materials based on children's abilities and interests, and the content should be adapted to the grade level, with varying depths and difficulties, to guide them according to the circumstances. Even the various games and activities of lower grades and kindergarten children should be appropriately supplemented with materials related to avenging national humiliation and saving the country to cultivate them. All levels of training must be based on this principle, implemented earnestly, and must be sustained and consistent from beginning to end. Reviving decline and establishing the foundation depends on this.</p>

<p>Our Country Cables Congratulations to the Assembly Chairman</p>
<p>Electric Timing Device to be Tested</p>
<p>India's Field Hockey Strength is the Strongest</p>
<p>Italy's Athletes Number One Hundred</p>
<p>Our Country Cables Wishes for the Success of the Assembly The 10th World Olympic Games will be held in Los Angeles in early August, as reported in this newspaper. Participants include more than 50 countries. Although our country cannot send athletes, Shen Siliang, honorary secretary of the National Sports Association, has decided to travel to the United States as a representative to show that our country is striving to follow in the footsteps of the advanced. Yesterday, the Association sent a congratulatory telegram to the chairman of this year's Olympic Games, wishing the conference success.</p>
<p>The Invention of the Electric Timing Device Accurate timing is most difficult in races, especially short distances, because a fraction of a second can make a significant difference. The 100-meter and 200-meter races take only about 20 seconds, so even a small difference can matter. The United States, which has the most advanced electrical industry, has an electric timing device that can solve this problem. According to a report from the Christian Science Monitor in Boston, an electric timing device that has been under development for some time has now been successfully completed. According to the inventor of this device, tests in the laboratory can measure five thousandths of a second without error. Columbia and Syracuse Universities tested it at Baker Field in New York last month during a track and field competition and were very satisfied. Former President of the American Athletic Association, Mr. Kerbey, said that if the tests continue to be satisfactory, he may propose its use at this year's Games.</p>
<p>Italy's Athletes Number 100 The conference received an official letter from the Italian Sports Association on May 24, stating that Italy had selected 120 athletes to participate in the championships of track and field, swimming, rowing, field hockey, equestrianism, boxing, and other events. The delegation is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on July 16.</p>
<p>Indian Delegation To Visit the United States The Indian field hockey representatives, a total of sixteen individuals, recently cabled the conference to enter their names, stating that they had departed from Bombay for the United States. It is noted that the Indian field hockey team are the incumbent champions of the previous World Games' field hockey championship. Recall that the final deciding match of the previous session was between India and the Netherlands. On that day, over ten thousand people were at the venue in the audience. As a result of the match, India defeated the Netherlands with a score of 3 to 0. The team has now boarded the Haruna Maru from India arriving in Japan. They shall be having a competition in Tokyo for a week, before switching to the Kameda Maru for their journey to America.</p>
<p>Australian Athletes Depart for the United States The athletes from Australia embarked on the Maryborough ship on the fourth from Sydney for the United States. Many people saw them off.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the January 28th Incident to the signing of the May 5th Truce Agreement, the devastation and blows suffered by Shanghai's educational sector have been roughly described in the previous articles, whether viewed as a mere account or as traces of blood and tears. After calming our pain, we pick up our pens with tears welling, and further calculate the total loss based on the statistical results released by the Municipal Bureau of Education. However, the value of many things is difficult to estimate with any quantity, and the materials that can be investigated are limited.

<h3 id="e133">Sharp Decline in the Silver Market, Stagnant Atmosphere <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Due to the continuous poor performance of the silver market in recent days, the market has been sluggish. Although there was a brief recovery at one point, it ultimately fell back and even continued to decline.</p>
<p>It is irredeemable. Observing the situation before and after the festival, it seems clear. Based on the current trend, it seems unlikely that there will be a turnaround. A prolonged decline is not fortunate for finance and various businesses. The future of the silver market also shows a loosening trend, which is of little help and is regrettable.</p>
<p>Silver Market Prices: The "silver dollar" morning market price improved by 7.5 cents compared to before the festival (i.e., the 7th), reaching 6 yuan, 9 fen, 4 li, 7.5 hao. The afternoon market fell by 7.5 cents again, remaining the same as before the festival, at 6 yuan, 9 fen, 4 li. The "silver split" opened at 2 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, slightly better than before the festival, but the silver market remained as loose and chaotic as ever.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The price of Jiangnan small coins has recently decreased in line with the decline on the market. Yesterday it fell by 2 li to 5 yuan, 9 fen, 7 li. The morning and afternoon markets were the same, with only 5,000 jiao traded in the morning market. Guangdong small coins were 5 yuan, 9 fen, 3 li in the morning market and 5 yuan, 9 fen, 2 li, 7.5 hao in the afternoon market, with 165,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Steel yuan remained stable, unchanged at 425 yuan, 500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver funds" yesterday needed to be cleared and processed together for two days due to the closure of the silver coin industry the day before, making it relatively complicated. Foreign merchants cleared and settled 3.6 to 3.7 million in bills, and 6.4 to 6.5 million in various goods, telegrams, mortgages, special items, miscellaneous items, etc. Chinese merchants cleared and settled over 4.5 million in bills, and 6.8 to 6.9 million in various goods, remittance exchanges, customs duties, mortgage remittances, miscellaneous foreign currencies, etc. Foreign merchants withdrew 800,000 from warehouses, and Chinese merchants withdrew 1 million. Banks and money shops cleared and settled over 31 million, and "huatou" funds cleared and settled over 5.3 to 5.4 million. Remittance funds from various routes cleared and settled over 900,000, and "chaipiao" transactions were 3 to 4 million, clearing and settling over 1 million. "Foreign currency funds" exchange bills, the morning market made 710,000, the afternoon market made 800,000 and 5,000. Banknotes were 50,000 in the morning market and 40,000 in the afternoon market. Outside the market, banknotes were 110,000 in the morning market and 45,000 in the afternoon market. Bank checks traded 20,000 in the morning market. Bank trading, foreign currencies, and the morning inter-market was 600,000, and the afternoon market was 750,000. Money shops and foreign public notes cleared and settled over 7.9 million, and "huatou" foreign currency funds cleared and settled over 2.4 to 2.5 million. "Chaichai" foreign currency inflows and outflows were over 1.7 million, and small money shop transactions were 600,000 to 700,000.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Observing the Background of the Silver Decline <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Prelude to the Abolition of Taels</p>
<p>The continuous decline in the price of silver this year has reached its lowest point to date. It seems to be the lowest, exceeding the minimum price of over twenty years ago (7 qian, 5 li, 1 hao and a half) by more than 1 fen. If there were no special background, this decline would not have been so severe. Although current funds are abundant, during the 31st year of Emperor Guangxu's reign (Qing Dynasty), the current silver reserves in June and July once exceeded 200 million (formerly the prosperity of Shanghai was not as great as it is today, it would have to be at a 4:1 ratio). In the prosperous conditions of Shanghai today, it would be not an exaggeration to say that there is 500 to 600 million, especially since there weren't as many bank notes. The inside story of the cause of the drop in silver is that there were rumours that someone wanted to propose the abolition of taels (and replace it with yuan, although this had been agreed to, it has not yet been implemented). Judging from the current situation, this proposal might definitely be tested. Otherwise, the silver decline would continue without limit, and the hidden consumption in society's daily life needs would be immeasurable. While not certain, we will wait for future verification.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Gold Market Continues Upward Trend <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Another 4.3 Taels Higher: Yesterday, the gold market's upward trend gained further momentum, remaining stable. The price fluctuation throughout the day did not exceed five taels, with an overall increase of slightly more than four taels. It rose immediately upon opening, diverging from the silver market, where the British pound rose and the US dollar fell. Exchange rates also showed a decline. Heng Xing, Nei Xing, and Da De Cheng and other firms exhibited strong buying interest, further sharpening the upward momentum, briefly reaching 725 or 726 taels. Subsequently, due to the easing of bill tensions, but with Da Lian firms and others selling heavily, the market turned downward. However, the market regained its strength later on, ultimately due to a perceived shortage of spot goods. A certain bank actively acquired more than 500 bars, at a price of 722 or 723 taels, which Da De Cheng and others sold, thus driving up the futures market price. Detailed information on the market's performance throughout the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>Early Market Exuberance: From the early part of July, the market opened with an immediate increase of 3.2 mace, reaching 723.8 taels. This was due to the large bars increasing by 1/8 to 1/16 in the preceding two days, while the silver price decreased by a small 1/8, and private telegrams also reflected this trend, boosting market confidence. Heng Yu and Nei Xing were the first to enter the market, followed by 24.5 taels. However, Wan Xing Shun Li and others sold. Also, as the US dollar initially appeared strong, Sumitomo bought October at 81.15 to 81.75, then depreciated by 2 taels, to 22.6 mace. Soon after, banks mutually traded September at 375, and also bought August British gold at 18.1875. Furthermore, Da De Cheng, Heng Xing, Hong Kang Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Yu, Bing Xing, Fu Yu, Tian Feng Yong, and others rushed to enter the market. As a certain bank opened to buy 210 spot bars, market confidence improved further, and the price rose by more than 3 taels, reaching 25.5 taels at 9:30 AM. HSBC listed British currency at par and US currency reduced by 0.125, due to the small exchange rate squeeze. At that time, the price increased from 25 taels to 26 taels, and the domestic market tightened further. Afterwards, Da Lian firms, Qian Chang Xiang, Zhi Feng Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Yu and others divested, and HSBC and others released August US dollars at 31.125, July at 30.875, and September at 375 for settlement, resulting in a decline of more than 3 taels, reaching 22.2 mace at 10:20 AM. However, from 9:30 to 10:15 AM, the price fluctuation was only a few cash, at most 1 tael up or down. The market began to improve again at 10:30 AM. July US dollars were traded against September at 9375, and October at 5625. Da De Cheng, Bing Xing and others bought in, and a certain bank continued to acquire 140 spot bars, thus increasing by 2 taels, reaching 24.1 taels close to 11:00 AM. The price then briefly fell by more than 2 taels, due to Da Lian firms selling heavily. Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan Tai, and Heng Yu also sold. In just ten minutes, the price dropped to 21.4 mace. Subsequently, it rose by 2 taels, with general short positions covering their positions. At 11:30 AM, the price was 23 taels. Da Lian firms sold again, reducing by more than 1 tael, reaching 21.6 mace at 11:50 AM. The market then closed at 22.3 mace. The quoted price was changed to 793 taels, canceling about 70 taels.</p>
<p>Stable Afternoon Trading: The afternoon market opened at 21.7 mace, then at 1.6 mace. Shun Li and Hong Kang Yong sold. Subsequently, the market was very peaceful, with a slight increase of 0.3 to 0.4 mace until 2:30 PM, when it began to rise by more than 2 taels, due to Da De Cheng, Wan Xing, Yi Feng Yong, and Yong items hedging. Mitsui also absorbed this month's US dollars at 30.8125, and October at 5625, with recent settlements continuing, calculated at 7/875. After 3:00 PM, the price was 24.5 taels. Heng Xing, Fu Yu, and Zhi Feng Yong sold. Shanghai even offered September at 4375, and Mitsui required October at 625, resulting in a price difference of about 2 taels. Around 3:40 PM, the price was 23.6 mace, with Heng Yu and others buying in. Rumors spread that a certain bank was opening for spot goods again. HSBC absorbed October US dollars at 5625. At 3:50 PM, the price was 24.4 mace. Unfortunately, Heng Xing and Fu Yu sold, preventing the price from penetrating higher. At 4:10 PM, the price returned to 23.5 mace, then quickly strengthened, with Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Tong Fu, Zhi Feng Yong, and items showing strong buying interest, jumping 1.6 to 1.7 mace, to 25.2 mace. The price then rose slightly by 0.4 to 0.5 mace. At the close of the market at 4:30 PM, the price was 24.9 mace, an increase of 4.3 mace compared to July (having risen nearly 10 taels in the last three days). After the close, as there seemed to be more sellers, the price was recalculated at 24 taels, so the items decreased by a small 0.6 mace. According to the whole day, the highest was 26 taels, and the lowest was 21.4 mace, a difference of 4.6 taels. The quoted price decreased from 72 to 68-69 taels, registered at 22 taels, replenishment at 22 taels, afternoon at 25 taels, and naked bars increased by 8.25.</p>
<p>Trading Not Quiet: Statistics on trading on the floor showed that Heng Xing, Tong Tai Chang, Hong Kang Yong, Fu Yu, and Tian Feng Yong all entered. Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Yu He, and Long Sheng were very busy entering and exiting. Yuan Tai, Yuan Mao Yong, Shun Li, Wan Xing, and Yi Feng Yong all exited. Those hedging bills had mixed activities, selling near-term and throwing out long-term contracts. In the afternoon, Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Wan Xing, Yi Feng, and Yong all entered. Shun Li, Fu Yu, and Heng Xing all exited. Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Tai, Hong Kang Yong, and Yu He both entered and exited. The Da Lian group collectively sold 1,200 to 1,300 bars and bought over 300 bars. The Guangdong group entered about 1,000 bars and exited 300 to 400 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e136">No Significant Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market saw the British pound rise and the US dollar remain stable. Exchange rates showed a slight rebound, but the previous day's decline resulted in a net decrease of more than one point. HSBC's listed British gold remained unchanged, while US dollars decreased by 0.125, to 30.025. Indian exchange increased by 0.25, German exchange decreased by 0.075, and French exchange decreased by 2 yuan. There were no other changes. The domestic British market was flat and the US market was firm, due to the exchange rate trending lower. However, there were no significant fluctuations throughout the day, and the gold market repeatedly rose by more than 4 taels, truly due to active spot trading.</p>
<p>Remaining Inventory Particularly Scarce: Comparing the results of the past seven days, British gold was even, and near-term US dollars were neither good nor bad. Long-term contracts decreased by 0.125. Trading among Chinese merchants was still active, with British gold not exceeding several tens of thousands of pounds, with a slight withdrawal. US dollar transactions reached 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, with various gold firms selling October and settling July-August. HSBC was still selling. It is heard that there were certain positions settled previously that are now being gradually divested, resulting in the market not appearing overly favorable yesterday.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The domestic market was very flat, opening at a selling price of 1 shilling 8 pence 0.0625, to 0.1875, a buying price of 0.125 to 0.25. Pan Gen entered August at 0.1875, and Hua Bi entered June at 0.125. The afternoon close was flat, with no significant changes.</p>
<p>US Exchange: The domestic market had a difference of 0.25 all day. This month swapped to September, with a difference of 0.75 to 0.625. From the morning, the selling price for this month was 30.075, July at 9375, August at 31.125, and September at 4375. The buying price was increased by 0.125. Sumitomo entered October early at 31.8125 to 75. Mai Xing exited and Hua Yi entered September at 375. Zhong Fu, Shanghai, and HSBC exited August at 125. Mai Xing, Hua Bi, and HSBC exited July at 30.875. Hua Mao and Zhejiang mutually traded July at 9375. Mai Xing and He Jian traded October at 5625. Hua Bi and Mitsui mutually traded July at 30.0875. The afternoon close was flat. In the afternoon, Mitsui entered June at 8125, and October at 5625. Hua Bi exited July at 875. Mitsui entered October at 625. Shanghai exited September at 4375.

<p>Yesterday (9th), the trading situation in the Chinese Merchant Securities Yi Min Market: Although various spot goods were opened in the afternoon market, transactions were still scarce, totaling only 20,000 yuan. The futures market was also very quiet, and the market atmosphere was idle. In the morning market, only over 900,000 yuan was transacted, and in the afternoon market, there was only over 1.6 million yuan, totaling 2,570,000 yuan. Among them, salt tax accounted for 685,000, unified tax accounted for 520,000 yuan, and the rest was only around 200,000 yuan. July futures transactions remained as sparse as before. As for the trend of various bond prices, due to the quiet and stable political situation, with no new developments, coupled with the approaching end of the financial period, people were watching and waiting. Large-scale entries and exits were minimal, and bond prices fluctuated without significant changes. However, the coldness of market demand and the non-negligible retail sales resulted in a decline of about 0.5 to 0.6 yuan compared to Tuesday. The future prospects may become even more sluggish.</p>

<p>Since the US House of Representatives passed Garner's unemployment relief bill, the New York stock market has been greatly affected, causing the market to fall back to its lowest level in a week. Sellers of various representative stocks continued incessantly. "American Telephone and Telegraph" broke its previous record low by as much as three points. The steel industry's production rate last week decreased again by 3%, which is the reason why US Steel stock fell by a weak two points. Garner's proposal advocates allocating 200 million in funds to build public works projects to regulate the unemployed. If this plan is implemented, the government will inevitably increase its burden, and the future effects are unpredictable. It is expected that this plan will cause fierce debate in the Senate, damaging the spirit of cooperation. Furthermore, the motion to reduce $48 million from the original $980 million veterans' bonus plan was also rejected by the House and Senate. At a time when political debates are unsettled, business is difficult to expect to improve. Therefore, unless government finances are stable, the stock market may continue to trend downwards. Wednesday's Dow Jones index is as follows:</p>
<p>June 7, June 8, Up/Down</p>
<p>*   30 Industrials: 47.47, 45.20, Down 2.27</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e140">Marked Yarn Falls Below 50 Taels <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is moving towards a soft trend, with the decline becoming more pronounced. This is due to the price of raw materials in the raw materials sector plummeting. Due to certain factors, the decline in Chinese yarn has not been as drastic, but the overall situation is extremely poor. With agricultural decline, purchasing power in all areas is greatly lacking, and Japanese merchants are actively selling yarn in all directions, greatly impacting local yarn. Fortunately, the inventory of domestic goods in various factories is not yet very large, and prices can still be maintained, but some factories are said to have difficulties with their inventory. In terms of the world market, the marked yarn is feared to be unavoidable to undergo another drastic change.</p>
<p>Human Marked Down Another 1.5 Taels: In the early market for human marked yarn, the price of American cotton tended to fall, requiring a cool head. Market sentiment was weak, and selling was more active. Each month fell by 1.4, 5, 6, 8 qian. Each month broke the 50 tael mark. Market sentiment in the afternoon was still flat, and some profit-takers settled, rising slightly by 1, 2, 3 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 22,100 bales. It was found that Chang Feng sold 1,700 bales, Xin Cheng 450 bales, Yi Yu 550 bales, Ren Feng 650 bales, Shen Ji 1,350 bales, Da Feng 750 bales, Ming De 500 bales, and Ji Feng 400 bales. Tong Yu bought 700 bales, Zhen Da 650 bales, Yi Chang 900 bales, Chang Feng 700 bales, Yi Da 500 bales, and Tong Fu 350 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Actual Yarn Down 1 Taels: Actual yarn transformation is still sluggish. It was found that the statistics for all gangs buying throughout the day were only 596 bales, with fellow traders entering 80 bales. The market price fell by 5 qian to 1 tael. Among the customer gangs, the mainland entered 55 bales, Jiangxi 25 bales, Shantou 11 bales, Luzhou 10 bales, Anqing 5 bales, Ningbo 25 bales, Guangdong 95 bales, Fujian 5 bales, Yunnan 345 bales, and Changsha 20 bales.</p>

<p>July Futures Fall into the 10 Taels Range</p>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, with a sharp decline. July fell sharply by 9 qian, reaching a new low not seen in years. This is due to world cotton being too cheap and local cotton being uniquely expensive. Therefore, large speculators and spot traders unanimously leaned towards short selling, making it even more difficult for the market to stand firm. However, there was some slight turnaround, but the overall situation is still not good. However, the recent decline has been too sharp, and there may be a short-term rebound.</p>
<p>Near-Term Zheng Marked Continues to Fall by 6-7 Qian: In the early market for Zheng marked cotton, the market sentiment was weak, and sellers were enthusiastic. Each month fell by 6, 7, 9 qian, with the far months being slightly more stable. In the afternoon, some covered short positions and rebounded by 1, 2 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 50,700 dan. It was found that Heng Yi sold 1,900 dan, Heng De 1,300 dan, Yu Kang 1,100 dan, Tong Xing 4,800 dan, Xin Cheng 3,000 dan, Yu Chang 3,000 dan, and Yi Cheng 1,000 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton weakened due to a lack of major buyers, good weather, and the New York market being sluggish. Futures fell by 11 to 13 points, and spot goods fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose and fell by 1 point, and spot goods rose by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was stable, with Pingguo'er falling by 2.75 rupees and Bairuoxi falling by 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (8th telegram):</p>

<h3 id="e143">Cotton Industry Conditions in Manchuria and Tianjin <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>According to a certain gentleman in the cotton industry who recently went to Manchuria, Shandong, Tianjin, and other places in the previous month to investigate the cotton industry, the situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Manchuria: In the past month, colored fabrics imported from Japan through Andong have accumulated in large quantities, estimated at 10,000 bales, putting pressure on goods from Shanghai, resulting in no large-scale transactions. In addition, with the decline of American cotton and silver ingots, the sales route from Shanghai to Manchuria is becoming increasingly depressed. Also, Shanghai yarn in various locations along the South Manchuria Railway has a small amount of inventory.</p>
<p>Tianjin: The inventory of Shanghai yarn and cloth in that area is still small, and there is a considerable sales route. However, there has been too little rainfall recently, and the prospects for agricultural products are worrying. Traders are unwilling to extend credit, so sales have declined, especially for Shanghai-made products.</p>
<p>Qingdao: There is considerable demand in that area, but recently, Japanese factories in Shanghai are starting to operate, and it is feared that the market price will fall, so buyers are waiting and watching, while sellers are eager to sell. Market prices have depreciated, but there are still no customers. The situation in Qingdao is the same as in Manchuria and Tianjin, with many Japanese goods arriving, putting pressure on Shanghai goods. Sales are currently hopeless. The products sold by Japanese factories in Qingdao include cotton cloth until September and cotton yarn until June. The sales of cotton yarn are more sluggish than cotton cloth due to the import of Shanghai yarn.</p>
<p>Weixian: The sales of colored fabrics are still good, but there are no transactions of raw-colored fabrics, and sales are particularly sluggish.</p>

<p>Another 300+ Bales Shipped Yesterday</p>
<p>This year's early and late silkworms in Haining's various cities and townships have been damaged by the weather, resulting in a strangely poor cocoon yield. The quality of the cocoons is poor, and few cocoon traders have opened scales for weighing, and they are suppressing prices for purchase. Most silkworm farmers are self-baking and self-reeling. The fresh cocoons collected by the local silk cocoon traders have all been dried and shipped to Shanghai in batches. In addition to the 200+ bales that have already been shipped, Hui Tong Company shipped another 300+ bales from Changan Station to Shanghai yesterday. The total cocoons weighed and purchased by Shanghai silk merchants this year are estimated to be only 800-900 bales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was still no turnaround in the Shanghai foreign firm silk market. European and American markets could not sell Chinese silk at factory prices. Telegrams showed silk prices were still low. The old silk in the hands of various manufacturers were heavily invested, requiring a loss of 500-600 taels per bale, and were all mortgaged to the financial sector. Overseas prices were not enough to redeem the principal and interest, resulting in a desperate situation. Silk sales have also been suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Tea Market Downturn Unabated <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign firm tea market, Zhen Mei green tea from Tunxi, Suian, and Xi County, and Ying Zhuang Xie He Jin Tiao Tong Fu and other firms, all had stomach appetite for it. Needle Mei and Xiu Mei items were particularly active. The trading of red and green tea throughout the city was quite prosperous. However, in recent days, traders, seeing that Chinese merchants were eager to sell, became even more demanding with their prices. Yesterday, the market price of Zhen Mei, Needle Mei and other green teas, as well as Qi Fu red tea, fell by 4-5 taels to more than 10 taels. The trend of the tea market is not considered optimistic.</p>

<p>100,000 Foreign Rice Arrives, 4,000 Sacks of Wenzhou Coarse Rice</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Gang Continues to Handle Xiao Xiao Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market initially showed an upward trend as various guest gangs arrived in the market to inquire after the Dragon Boat Festival. However, in terms of actual sales, only the Yi Zhenjiang gang handled more than 1,000 bags of Xiao Xiao rice. Other firms had no movement apart from continuing to deal with each other within the street. A new ship of Xiao Jiao rice arrived, with over 100,000 bags, so market sentiment reversed to a downward trend, and the market price weakened by nearly a corner. The entire market only offered 4,000 bags of Xiao Jiao rice, priced at 10 yuan 5 jiao to 10 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen.</p>
<p>Guest indica rice is sold as soon as it arrives, and there is no surplus in the market. However, the market price has been affected by foreign rice, and has repeatedly weakened. A new batch of Wenzhou coarse rice arrived yesterday, with over 4,000 bags. The market only offered 400 bags, priced at 10 yuan 2 jiao to 10 yuan, which is also less than a corner compared to last week.</p>
<p>Marked Flour Market</p>
<h3 id="e149">Miserable Start, Excellent Ending <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after opening in the morning, the market for each month trended toward a miserable appearance. Foreign wheat quotations continued to shrink by around 3-4 jiao (Chicago's near-term fell another 5 jiao), and the sluggish environment depressed market sentiment, causing prices to fall by another around 2.5 fen. July, August, September, and October were all priced at 9 qian for customs entry, which shows the market's decline. When the afternoon market opened, July was at its lowest at 1 tael 8 qian 7.5 fen. But it suddenly rose, because although the major factories found themselves at a loss as to what to do about the slack sales, the continuous declines would make it harder for sales to improve, so the 6th month spot was priced at 1 tael 9 qian, and 7th month standards could no longer be sampled and bought. For this reason, market sentiment changed greatly, rising one step at a time, rebounding by 3-4 fen from the lowest morning price, a situation that seemed to be manufactured. In the end, compared to Tuesday's closing prices, the 7th month improved 5 li, the 8th month improved 9, the 9th month improved 1 fen and 2.5 li, the 10th month dropped 1.5 fen, and the 11th month rose 7 li.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Forward Wheat Slightly Rebounds Before Closing <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the forward wheat market, after opening in the morning, the market for each month was as quiet as usual because the foreign wheat quotations continued to shrink by 3-4 jiao, so the opening prices of each month were slightly lower than on Tuesday by 3-4 fen. When the afternoon market opened, the market was still sluggish, until it was closing, when the rumored rebound in the forward flour market was very sharp, market sentiment shifted, and the prices for each month saw a slight rise. The 7th and 8th months were on par with Tuesday, while the off-season was still soft. Observing the future, before the various factories start handling new wheat, this stable scene will not be able to hold up. In the end, the 7th and 8th months were unchanged, the 9th month was slightly better by 1 fen, and the 10th and 11th months were slightly lower by 3 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the hardware trend underwent a big turnaround, with brisk customer sales and huge factory demand, so the deals were numerous. Prices did not soar immediately, but the market was much firmer than previously. 28-gauge corrugated iron was estimated at 11 taels 2 qian 5 fen yesterday, which is already 2 qian 5 fen better than before. Although 26-gauge and 24-gauge did not increase in price, the market felt firmer than before. French pig iron can now occupy 7 taels 9 qian, which is also 5 fen better than before, and 700-800 barrels were reportedly traded. In addition, tinplate, blue lead, triangular iron, garden lead wire, etc., all felt very strong.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Wang Jingwei Returned to Nanjing Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Important Meeting Held at Chen’s Residence Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Cai [Finance Minister] Song and Jiao [Transportation Minister] Chen Have Not Yet Agreed to Resume Their Posts</p>
<p>Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei came to Shanghai to persuade Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Transportation Minister Chen Mingshu to withdraw their resignations. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, another important meeting was held at Chen Mingshu's residence. Participants included Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Transportation Minister Chen Mingshu, Railway Minister Gu Mengyu, Industry Minister Chen Gongbo, and Wang himself. They discussed the overall central financial plan and earnestly urged Song and Chen to resume their posts. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM. It is said that Chen Mingshu's determination to resign remained firm, while Song Ziwen's attitude softened somewhat after Wang's strong persuasion. Wang felt that his trip had come to an end and thus took a special train from Zhenru back to Nanjing at 2:25 PM yesterday afternoon. Details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation at Yesterday Morning’s Meeting At 9:00 AM yesterday morning,</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei convened a meeting at Chen Mingshu's residence. Attendees included Transportation Minister Chen Mingshu, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Railway Minister Gu Mengyu, and Industry Minister Chen Gongbo. Chen had arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. During the meeting, Finance Minister Song Ziwen arrived first, followed by Wang Jingwei, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, and others. They then began discussing various issues. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM. While the meeting was in progress, Vice Minister of Transportation Chen Fumu also arrived around 11:00 AM. However, he did not participate in the meeting and left after only two minutes.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's Remarks After the meeting concluded, Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen were the first to leave. According to Wang's statement to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the resignations of Ministers Song and Chen were due to difficulties in their policies. When we retain Minister Song, we should also help him break this deadlock. As for Minister Chen, he also faces unavoidable difficulties in his environment, and we should also find ways to eliminate them. Today's meeting involved thorough discussions. Regarding financial matters, since military spending accounts for a large portion of the Ministry of Finance's expenditures, we intend to consult with all parties to devise a solution.</p>
<p>Round Table Conference and Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Wang then discussed the Round Table Conference and the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia. He said that on the Round Table Conference, our side accepted the League of Nations' proposal to find a satisfactory resolution to the Northeast and Shanghai issues between China and Japan. Based on the League of Nations' resolution and our established position, we can participate in the conference at an appropriate time. However, Japan is now advocating separate resolutions for the Northeast and Shanghai incidents, which contradicts both the original scope of the League of Nations' proposal and the central government's established policy. The central government's original position remains unchanged. If Japan insists on separate resolutions for the Shanghai and Northeast incidents, our side will consistently refuse to participate. As for the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia, the central government has discussed it repeatedly and has drafted concrete measures. Once the final decision is made, it can be implemented. We must recognize that resuming diplomatic relations with Russia and allying with Russia are two entirely different matters, and that resuming diplomatic relations and tolerating communists are also two entirely different matters. The central government is still carefully considering the matter, and it must also understand the current situation in Soviet Russia. Wang also said that the central government has always paid attention to the Northeast issue. If Japan continues to press, the central government will certainly resist. However, we should also prepare in advance. We only need to observe the current situation between Russia and Japan to understand the need for thorough preparation. Our resistance against external forces should be proactive, not passive.</p>
<p>Wang Returned to Nanjing This Afternoon After returning to his residence, Wang immediately telegraphed the two railway bureaus, ordering them to prepare a special train to Zhenru so that he could depart at any time. Upon receiving the order, the railway bureau dispatched a decorated train from the North Station at 12:37 PM, which stopped at Zhenru Station. Wang arrived at Zhenru to board the train at 1:50 PM. Those who saw him off included Wang's wife, Chen Bijun, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Railway Minister Gu Mengyu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, Director of the Two Railway Bureaus Chen Xinghan, and Director of the Traffic Department Zheng Baozhao. Wang and others arrived at the station at 2:22 PM and shook hands with everyone who came to welcome and send them off. The special train departed at 2:25 PM.</p>
<p>The Attitudes of Song and Chen According to reliable sources, Finance Minister Song Ziwen claimed illness and resigned due to financial difficulties. Transportation Minister Chen Mingshu also submitted his resignation due to difficult circumstances. However, after Wang Jingwei came to Shanghai to persuade them to stay, Song's intention to resign had softened somewhat. However, Transportation Minister Chen Mingshu expressed his firm resignation due to various reasons. According to sources from the railway bureau, Chen will return to Nanjing today to handle private matters, which are unrelated to his official duties. Before a suitable candidate is appointed, the affairs of the Ministry of Transportation will be temporarily managed by Vice Minister Chen Fumu.</p>

We are very pleased to hear that you have safely entered the customs. Whether this trip will help the investigation team is still unknown. However, since the fall of the eastern provinces, the rampant enemy flames, the suffering of the people, and the desperate struggles of the volunteer armies in various places, your on-site observation and warnings to the people based on what you have witnessed will surely inspire the hearts of those who are not yet dead and seek a final solution together. We hope that you will speak out loudly and offer strong advice to both the government and the public from a proactive perspective. In particular, you must use all your strength to advise the central government and the northern authorities that this is a critical moment of survival, and it is not just about the corner of the eastern provinces.

<p>Yesterday, West of the Shajing Port</p>
<h3 id="e155">Sudden Deployment of Japanese Troops <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Merchants and People Panicked and Closed Their Businesses</p>
<p>Chinese Police on Alert Thankfully Nothing Happened</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that at around 5:30 PM yesterday, in the area west of Shajing Hong, under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District and Third Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, where police power had not yet been accepted, two trucks of Japanese troops suddenly arrived and</p>
<p>deployed posts along the embankment, from Xiangyan Bridge to Hujia Mu Bridge and Qimei Road, checking pedestrians, searching door to door, and erecting barbed wire at Hujia Mu Bridge, cutting off traffic. For a time, people were in a state of panic, and shops closed their doors one after another. The Fifth District and Third Precinct Chief Wu Tingxun supervised the police officers and the Shanghai-Beiping Security Team to be on strict alert. Fortunately, no disturbances occurred, and local order remained normal. The following is a transcript of the report from Wu Tingxun, Chief of the Fifth District and Third Precinct, to the Zhabei Office of the Public Security Bureau Receiving Committee: "It is reported that at around 5:30 PM this afternoon, in the area west of Shajing Port under the jurisdiction of this precinct, two trucks of Japanese troops suddenly arrived. After getting out of the vehicles, they checked pedestrians along the embankment and deployed posts, blocking Xiangyan Bridge and Hujia Mu Bridge with barbed wire and wooden frames, cutting off traffic. Five Japanese soldiers were also stationed at Xiangyan Bridge, conducting very strict checks, not allowing pedestrians to pass through. The people watching at that place were like a wall, and shops closed their doors one after another, with extreme panic. The chief has supervised the police officers and security team to be on strict alert and dispersed the idlers. The local area is still peaceful. In addition to telegraphing a report and conducting investigations at any time, the details of the Japanese troops' actions are hereby reported for review."</p>

<p>Recovering Lost Territory is the Common Will of the People</p>
<p>Currently Occupied with Relief Efforts and Have No Time to Attend to Other Matters</p>
<p>Shanghai Gentry and Merchants Raising Funds is Another Organization</p>
<p>The Rumor of Recruiting Volunteer Army in Shanghai is Groundless</p>
<p>On the 7th, the Shanghai newspapers reported that "Zhu Qinglan is the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army," and the Japanese newspapers reported that "The Northeast Volunteer Army is recruiting soldiers in Shanghai and will sneak into Manchukuo." Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited Zhu to inquire about the truth of the reports in the two newspapers. Zhu replied that the Northeast is our country's territory, and the Japanese warlords occupied it by force and then organized a puppet state, wanting to permanently occupy our Northeast by the means of exterminating Korea. The people of the whole country are deeply saddened and hope that the government will recover the lost territory as soon as possible, which is the common will of the people. However, I am focused on handling relief work. At this time when the harvest is not yet in and the old grain is gone, the disaster victims are extremely distressed, and I am currently trying to find ways to provide relief. I really have no time to attend to other matters. As for the Shanghai gentry and merchants raising funds to aid the Northeast Army, the report said that it is another organization. The talk of recruiting a volunteer army in Shanghai is even more groundless. The Northeast is full of patriotic people, so why recruit in the South again? Moreover, the climate and geography of the North are not familiar to the people of the South. The reports in the Japanese newspapers are purely fabricated and are just sensational tactics.</p>

<p>The Japanese Navy that invaded Shanghai has received orders from its Naval Ministry to withdraw back to Japan. Therefore, Nomura, Uematsu, Shiozawa, etc., have decided to return to their country tomorrow. The details of this situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Nomura Left the Hospital Yesterday Rear Admiral Nomura, Commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, was injured in the bombing in the New Park. After being treated at the Naval Hospital, it has been 41 days. His artificial eye has been fitted, and the rest of his bullet wounds have healed. He was discharged from the hospital yesterday. Because he was ordered to return to his country, he specially visited the naval commanders of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States stationed in Shanghai today to thank them for their condolences during his illness.</p>
<p>Izumo Will Leave Shanghai Tomorrow The Izumo, Rear Admiral Nomura's flagship, is moored in front of the Japanese Consulate and is scheduled to depart for Japan on the 11th (tomorrow) at 11:00 AM. The cruiser Tokiwa is also scheduled to leave on the same day. The Tokiwa is stationed at the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu. Nomura, Shiozawa, and Uematsu, etc., will all board the ship at that wharf. The Japanese residents of Shanghai will be there to send them off.</p>
<p>The 15th Fleet Will Also Withdraw The four torpedo boats of the 15th Squadron under the Third Team have also received orders to withdraw. It is reported that several ships of the squadron have sailed to the Yangtze River and are now ordered to return to Shanghai. Due to time constraints, they will depart from Shanghai on the 13th and go directly to Sasebo Naval Port. At the same time, more than 700 naval soldiers will be withdrawn by ship. After that, the Japanese ships stationed in Shanghai will be under the jurisdiction of the First Overseas Dispatch Team, and a separate command will be established for the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Strictly Guarding Against the Memorial Service on the 12th</p>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Yingxing, sent a secret letter to the Director of the French Concession Police, Fébvre, yesterday. The original text is as follows: "Secretly addressed, it is reported that the Shanghai People's Anti-Ceasefire Agreement Aid Northeast Volunteer Army Association stated in a notice published in the newspaper on the 4th of this month that the association originally scheduled to convene a memorial service for martyr Gu Zhenghong and the martyrs who died in the Anti-Japanese War on 'May 30th'. Because of insufficient preparation, a notice was issued to change it to the 5th. Now, people from all walks of life have sent letters requesting to participate. In order to expand the scope, it has been decided by the entire Executive Committee to reschedule it to 10:00 AM on the 12th of this month at the West Gate Public Sports Field to hold a memorial service for the martyrs who died in the Northeast Songhu Anti-Japanese War. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will gather in teams to attend the meeting. This notice is hereby issued. It is reported to the bureau that</p>
<p>because the association had not been approved and was in a period of martial law, it published a notice in the newspaper on its own initiative to hold a meeting on June 5th, and it was ordered to be banned and the authorities were requested to temporarily close the iron gates along the Republic Road. Now it has been found that the association has recently rescheduled the event, and in addition to ordering the subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit it, it should also be communicated. It is hoped that you will investigate and request that the iron gates along the Republic Road be temporarily closed on the morning of the 12th of this month in order to prevent and maintain public security. To maintain public friendship, this is addressed to Fébvre, the Director of the French Concession Police. Director Wen Yingxing."</p>
<p>Telephone Workers in the Concession</p>
<h3 id="e160">Presented New Conditions Yesterday <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>After Representatives Negotiated with the Company</p>
<p>The Company Agreed to Respond This Morning</p>
<p>After the telephone company workers in the concession went on strike, the head office and the warehouses of various district branches were heavily guarded. The strike committee</p>
<p>presented new conditions to the company yesterday, but there was still no solution. The company is scheduled to respond at 10:00 AM this morning. The details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Heavily Guarded Yesterday, the workers at the head office on Jiangxi Road and the warehouses of various district branches continued their strike. The inspectors from various districts organized by the strike committee were fully dispatched to work, and the order was very good. The Public Concession Police were ordered to strengthen their strict precautions. The iron gate of the head office on Jiangxi Road was closed. The Sima Road Police Station specially sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to be stationed under arms to protect it. The branches and warehouses in various districts were all guarded by the police, and the precautions were strict. The automatic machines in various districts were still talking as usual. Mass Meeting Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the entire</p>
<p>workers gathered near Fujian Road to hold a mass meeting, attended by more than 1,000 people. Five temporary chairmen were elected to report on the progress of the strike and to resolve (1) to welcome representatives to negotiate with the capitalists for victory, (2) to support the Workers' Protection Committee, (3) to oppose any mediation and let the strike committee directly negotiate with the capitalists, and (4) to schedule a reception for reporters at the Xinghualou on Sima Road at 2:00 PM on the 10th to report on the origins of the strike.</p>
<p>New Conditions Presented The strike committee presented the following new conditions to the company yesterday: The workers have been serving your company, and their wages are meager, and their lives are miserable. This is well known to your company and people from all walks of life. When the Shanghai January 28th Incident occurred this year, Chinese and foreign residents in the war zone fled to safe areas, but the workers disregarded their lives and families and continued to work for your company in the midst of gunfire. However, your company did not reward the workers for this action, but canceled the old practice of increasing wages every April on Sundays. At the same time, the company fired a large number of workers. After the dismissal, not only was no severance pay given, but the savings that the workers had accumulated over the years were often deducted and confiscated by the company for various reasons, and it was planned to buy and hire White Russians to replace the work of the workers. This kind of oppression and exploitation has made the workers unable to bear it, and other oppressions and exploitations cannot be described in words. Therefore, the workers announced a general strike at 7:00 PM on June 7th and put forward the following conditions, requesting the company to fully agree to implement the six required conditions within 18 hours and to recognize the preliminary agreement between labor and capital, so as to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Otherwise, the strike will be prolonged and expanded, and your company shall be fully responsible. (1) Oppose the dismissal of workers, immediately restore the jobs of the workers who were dismissed after May 30th this year, and pay the wages of the workers who were dismissed during the period of dismissal. (2) Regardless of new or old workers, increase wages uniformly according to the following proportions: increase 10 yuan below 20 yuan, increase 8 yuan above 30 yuan, and increase 5 yuan below 40 yuan. (3) Wages shall be paid as usual during the strike. (4) Recognize the trade union as the full representative of the workers. The company shall subsidize the trade union with 600 yuan per month for expenses and provide a office. In the future, the trade union shall be responsible for handling any labor-capital relations. (5) Female telephone operators shall rest for two months before and after production, and wages shall be paid as usual, and a production fee of 50 yuan shall be paid. (6) Please issue the savings and severance pay for the workers who were dismissed after the January 28th Incident and before May 30th this year. It is hoped that the company can understand the actual situation of the workers, fully sign and answer, and immediately implement the following articles. It is hoped that the workers will sign and acknowledge the following articles as a preliminary agreement for future labor-capital changes. (1) According to the current working hours, no excuses shall be made to increase them again, and workers may again request a seven-hour working day for female workers and a six-hour working day for young female workers. (2) In addition to fulfilling the wage increase this time, (3) Holidays and various trade union holidays shall be taken as usual, and the cancellation of Sunday holidays shall be opposed. Wages shall be doubled for work during holidays. (4) The savings and six months' severance pay shall be kept by the workers themselves. (5) If a worker is injured or disabled on duty, a pension equivalent to one year's wages shall be paid until the injury is healed and work is resumed, or for life after the age of 50 without working, and a pension shall be provided. (6) If a worker dies on duty, a pension of 50 yuan shall be paid (7) During periods of illness and marriage leave, wages shall be paid as usual, and expenses for medical treatment shall be paid. They shall not be dismissed if they recover from illness. In addition to the existing external doctors for seeing patients, Chinese doctors shall be hired. (8) Raincoats shall be issued to outdoor workers on rainy days, and indoor and outdoor workers shall be subsidized with 4 yuan per month for transportation expenses, and double salaries shall be paid at the end of the year. (9) Workers in air-conditioned rooms shall have the same meal time as ordinary workers. (10) The working</p>
<p>time of workers in the stove room shall be the same as that of ordinary workers. (11) Work shall not be transferred casually, and workers in each room shall not be transferred to do odd jobs. (12) If the company hires new workers, the trade union shall first introduce unemployed telephone workers to supplement the workforce. (13) The employment of White Russians shall be opposed. (14) The company shall oppose increasing telephone charges for users. Shanghai Telephone Workers' Strike Committee and all more than 3,000 workers. June 9.</p>
<p>Negotiations Began The strike committee, according to the decision of the meeting, appointed four representatives, Pan Dingquan, Xu Shijie, Ye Gongxing, Zheng Luojie, etc., to go to the telephone company at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road at 2:30 PM yesterday to present the terms of treatment, totaling 14 items. Because the manager was out,</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Watson received them. He first advised all the workers to return to work before negotiating the conditions. The workers demanded that the company accept the conditions before returning to work, so the two sides were at odds. Later, the engineer agreed to consult with the manager and scheduled a response at the New Central Bank on Fujian Road at 10:00 AM today. The representatives withdrew at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Response Today The telephone company workers at the head office and various district branches gathered at the New Central Bank on Fujian Road at 2:00 PM yesterday under the order of the strike committee. Upon hearing the news, the police immediately sent a large number of Chinese and Western armed detectives to maintain order. About 400 workers gathered and went to the head office because the representatives were at the head office on Jiangxi Road, standing on the side of the road, waiting quietly for news of the negotiations. When all the representatives withdrew, they declared to the workers that they would wait for the company's response on Fujian Road tomorrow (the 10th). So the workers went along Jiujiang Road, with Chinese and Western detectives behind them, maintaining order, fearing that the workers would gather again.</p>
<p>The Workers' Representatives Refuted Yesterday, the members of the strike committee issued a statement refuting the company's statement, saying: (1) The capitalists said that the workers did not give prior notice, but the workers had already proposed conditions for improving treatment in the name of all the workers last year, but the capitalists refused. Now, in view of the lack of security in life, they are carrying out a strike. (2) The capitalists said that the strike was to restore the work of dismissed workers, which is an attempt to divide the unity of the workers in the industry. (3) The capitalists said that the company has always paid special attention to the welfare of employees, which is a deceptive tactic. (4) The company said that the striking workers destroyed the machines, which is completely untrue. It is a rumor that the company is attacking the workers. If this is really the case, how can the automatic machines talk?</p>
<p>Notice from the Strike Committee The strike committee notified all members yesterday, saying: For the purpose of notification, the strike committee</p>
<p>resolved yesterday (the 8th) to send representatives to negotiate with the capitalists, but without results. Another discussion will be held at 10:00 AM tomorrow. If the capitalists still do not have a satisfactory response, then it is necessary to continue the strike. It is scheduled for 7:00 AM on the 10th (Friday), and all our striking workers shall gather in front of the gate on Fujian Road to welcome the representatives and prepare for a third negotiation with the capitalists.</p>
<p>Responding to the Strike After the Chang'an Road Chinese Electric Company in Zhabei, which contracted for the automatic machines of the concession telephone company, received a letter from the strike committee calling on all the workers of the company to provide assistance, about 40 workers from the company who worked at the Fujian Road Telephone Branch were dispatched at about 8:00 AM yesterday. It is reported that they have implemented assistance to the telephone workers, joined the strike, and put forward their own terms of treatment, which will be requested from the capitalists.</p>
<p>Company Statement The Shanghai Telephone Company issued a statement yesterday saying that although some striking workers attempted to destroy the telephone near noon today, they were quickly repaired and were still able to talk as usual. In addition, striking workers have repeatedly threatened the employees who went to work, and all of them have been reported to the police station. About 1,000 Chinese employees went to work today, accounting for more than half of the total number of Chinese employees in the company. The strikers are limited to the manufacturing, installation, and maintenance departments. This evening, Chinese workers sent two Chinese letters to the company, but the person claimed to be only responsible for delivering the letters and had no right to discuss the contents. The letters have now been entrusted to someone for translation.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Yesterday's Comforting Gathering for Wang and Chen <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Promoting the Glory of National Products</p>
<p>Expressing National Spirit</p>
<p>Wang Pingnan, legal advisor of the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, and Chen Binghui, the 12th executive committee member, fervently patriotic and driven by righteous indignation, served as the commander of the Shanghai Citizens' Volunteer Army. They led the army to participate in the 19th Route Army, fighting the Japanese and killing enemies, achieving considerable merit. The association, in conjunction with the China National Products Maintenance Association, held a comforting gathering yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Ji畝地 (Nine Mu Land) clubhouse. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: The venue was set up in the grand hall of the National Products Maintenance Association, with the inscription "Comforting the Patriotic and Defense-Oriented Efforts of Comrades Wang Pingnan and Chen Binghui." In the center was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, placed below with flowers and souvenirs. On the four walls were banners such as "Comrades Wang Pingnan and Chen Binghui are Leaders in Defending the Nation and Resisting Aggression," "The Participation of Comrades Wang Pingnan and Chen Binghui in the Anti-Japanese War is a Fight for the Glory and Integrity of the National Products Community," "Comrades Wang Pingnan and Chen Binghui's Efforts to Kill Enemies Demonstrate a Courageous National Spirit," and "The National Products Community Unanimously Supports the Loyal and Brave Wang Pingnan and Chen Binghui Who Save the Nation," etc.</p>
<p>Participating Representatives: More than 200 people, including Xu Jianruo, Xu Genghua, Wang Hanqiang, Fang Jiange, Zhang Dezhai, Li Peiying, Wu Nianong, Ding Hongchuan, Liang Shixiong, Zhang Yizhou, Yang Yucheng, Liu Zhongying, Xu Tingzuo, Xun Boying, Gu Bingyuan, Pan Dechun, Hu Xiyuan, Wu Chunquan, Chen Yiting, and Yang Xiaoan, etc. Wang Jiean, Chen Yiting, and Fang Jiange were publicly elected as the presidium, and Xu Jianruo as the master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>Meeting Order: (1) Ringing the bell to take seats; (2) All bowing three times to the Party, the national flag, and Sun Yat-sen's portrait; (3) Reading Sun Yat-sen's will; (4) Silent tribute to the martyrs who died in the Anti-Japanese War; (5) Chairman's report on the purpose of the meeting; (6) Chairman reading the comforting speech; (7) Comrades Wang and Chen reporting on their anti-Japanese achievements; (8) Speeches by various representatives; (9) Chairman's closing remarks; (10) Photography; (11) Dinner; (12) Ringing the bell to conclude the meeting.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Chairman's Speech: (1) Chairman Wang Jiean reported, roughly stating that today, many comrades from the national products community gathered to hold a comforting gathering for comrades Wang and Chen. How solemn the ceremony, how profound the meaning. Comrades Wang and Chen are powerful figures in managing national product factories, bearing the important mission of saving the nation with national products and defeating economic aggression. When the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, comrades Wang and Chen were inspired by patriotic emotions, undertaking the national salvation work of killing enemies and charging forward. How noble their spirit of loyalty and bravery in resisting Japan, something that cannot be achieved by ordinary people. We deeply admire them. This is the motivation and worth of the comforting gathering, and so on. (2) Chairman Chen Yiting delivered the comforting speech, roughly stating that the Japanese imperialists are brutal and barbaric, destroying peace, and after seizing the rich Northeast, they are again exposing their ambitions, invading the prosperous Shanghai. Fortunately, the loyal and brave 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, responsible for defending their territory, vowed to resist to the death. And we, the patriotic citizens of Shanghai,</p>
<p>inspired by righteous indignation, enthusiastically joined the army, forming a volunteer army, participating in the Anti-Japanese War. Led by our national products community's pioneer, this association's legal advisor</p>
<p>Comrade Wang Pingnan, serving as the battalion commander, and this association's 12th executive committee member, Comrade Chen Binghui, serving as the transportation officer and acting battalion commander, led the entire army, under the command of Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan of the 158th Brigade, generously killing enemies, not hesitating to endure the hardships of eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, braving the dangers of gunfire, fighting fiercely</p>
<p>for a month, establishing no small amount of merit, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army, and arousing international excitement, truly demonstrating a courageous national spirit and a loyal and righteous patriotic fervor, bringing glory to the citizens of Shanghai and preserving the integrity of the national products community. Now that the agreement has been signed, and they have returned in triumph after achieving success, our association, in the aftermath of glory and admiration, is holding a solemn and sincere comforting gathering, and we also invite comrades Wang and Chen to report on their personal experiences in the Anti-Japanese War. The true meaning of this gathering: (1) is to formally comfort comrades Wang and Chen with our utmost sincerity for their hardships and toils in declaring labor for the country and guiding the people to resist aggression, (2) is that comrades are ashamed of their positions and could not participate in the work of killing enemies, taking advantage of this grand occasion, respectfully listening to the war report of comrades Wang and Chen, and expanding our knowledge. Now we stand up, very solemnly and respectfully, and give a comforting salute to comrades Wang and Chen, and sincerely wish them good health and continued efforts. Finally, on behalf of the comrades, we want to ask comrades Wang and Chen, without hesitation, to nakedly tell us their anti-Japanese achievements in detail, while the comrades listen attentively.</p>
<p>Comrade Chen reported: Chairman, fellow comrades, today I am honored to have these two groups hold this meeting to comfort me, but I am unworthy. Comrade Wang went to Xixi today to participate in the graduation ceremony of the volunteer army, and entrusted his brother to attend the meeting and express his thanks. Fighting the Japanese and killing enemies is our duty. The Shanghai Citizens' Volunteer Army followed the 19th Route Army, fighting with the violent Japanese, and fortunately relied on the enthusiastic mutual assistance of the people in the rear,</p>
<p>inflicting heavy damage on the organized and aggressive violent Japanese. When the volunteer army, under the command of Brigade Commander Weng, resisted and defended the Wusong and Baoshan areas, engaging in bloody mixed battles with the Japanese army, bravely killing enemies, and establishing merits, it aroused the admiration of Chinese and foreign troops, and became a great commemoration for publicizing the national spirit. Subsequently, they were ordered to safely retreat and defend Songjiang, and the courage of all the soldiers to defend the country and resist aggression increased with each passing day. They then retreated to Weiting in Kunshan, engaged in training, waiting for the opportunity to kill enemies, and increasing their tactical experience. Since the agreement was signed, the volunteer army is still serving under Brigade Commander Weng, preserving a glimmer of glory for the three million citizens. All the soldiers will graduate today and will return to Shanghai on the 11th, and so on. Finally, he also publicized the soldiers who worked hard in the volunteer army to show encouragement.</p>

<p>Advocating That the Air Force Should Not Participate in Civil Wars</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Huichang, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Guangdong Air Force, arrived in Shanghai by the Dollar Steamship Company's "President Lincoln" from Hong Kong a few days ago. He landed at the Xinguantou wharf on the Dollar Steampship's small steamship at 4:10 PM yesterday. His secretary, Mr. Lei, accompanied him. According to Mr. Zhang, this trip to Shanghai is for no official business, and the Guangdong situation is still under mediation, or there may be a turning point. He himself has always advocated that the air force should not participate in any civil war, which can comfort overseas Chinese who have donated money to purchase aircraft to return to the country. Zhang briefly talked with the aviator Shui Qirui, who came to welcome him at the pier, and then drove to his private residence on Yuyuan Road.</p>

<p>Ms. Liu Manqing, a member of the National Government's Commission for Tibetan and Mongolian Affairs, was recently appointed by the National Government as a special investigator for Tibet and Mongolia. Last night, she boarded a French steamer and left the country this morning to go to Hong Kong, then to Annam, and from Yuxi, Yunnan, to Batang, and then to Tibet, to investigate the current situation in Tibet and Mongolia, and to convey the National Government's plans for developing culture and industry in Tibet and Mongolia. She is scheduled to return to Shanghai in two years. Tibet and Mongolia are located in remote border areas, and are very isolated from the mainland. Therefore, Ms. Liu's trip is actually responsible for the important task of connecting national feelings.</p>
<p>Farewell: At noon yesterday, Huang Jingwan of the China Borderland Society, Guo Weiping of the Northwest Society, Hu Shuhua of the Northwest Problem Research Association, Liu Liangmo of the Borderland Research Association, Yan Ziduan of the Northwest Reclamation and Colonization Society, and Wang Weidan of the South China Plantation Company, etc., held a banquet at Gongdelin to bid farewell to Ms. Liu. Halfway through the banquet, Huang Jingwan stood up and said, "I sincerely wish Ms. Liu a safe journey, and I also believe that Tibet and Mongolia are China's natural resources, which urgently need to be developed. Developing industry and commerce is enough to save China, which is on the verge of danger. Ms. Liu's trip is actually responsible for this important task, because the most important thing for China at present is that the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted to the point of extreme pain. According to the customs report, last year the value of goods imported into the country exceeded the value of goods exported by as much as 500 million yuan, of which agricultural products accounted for the largest proportion. China has always been established by agriculture, and it has vast land and abundant resources, and rich mineral products. Now it has to rely on foreign countries, which is very dangerous. If we do not find a way to remedy it, China will perish even without the imperialists using warships and cannons. The way to save it,</p>
<p>is to revitalize industry, develop mineral products, and after the development of industry and mineral products, all the materials needed will not have to be supplied by others, so our comrades of the People's Livelihood Improvement Society are determined to engage in this, and also hope that Ms. Liu will give good instructions in the future, and hope that comrades in this area and Tibet and Mongolia will often interact with each other to seek cooperation, and benefit the nation, which depends on Ms. Liu's efforts." Then Ms. Chen Yongsheng of Shanghai University delivered a speech, roughly saying that there are many young people in Shanghai who hope to go to Tibet and Mongolia to engage in development work, which will not only be enough to recover rights and interests, but also to relieve the unemployment phenomenon. Please Ms. Liu go to Tibet and Mongolia to publicize and arrange in advance, so that the young people here can go, and so on. Later, Ms. Liu gave a thank-you speech, roughly saying, "Today, I am very grateful and honored for the kindness of various border groups and the instructions of the gentlemen of the educational news circles. The task of my re-entering Tibet and Mongolia is to accept the central government's investigation of the recent situation in Tibet and Mongolia, and to convey the culture here to Tibet and Mongolia, because I am a Tibetan, and I am more able to understand the situation in Tibet and Mongolia. However, my knowledge is shallow, and I still need your guidance at any time. The next time I come east, I plan to bring several young people from Tibet and Mongolia to study here, in order to develop the people's wisdom in the border areas. When the transportation is slightly more convenient, I hope that you will also travel to Tibet and Mongolia to give more guidance." The banquet ended after 3 pm, and they took photos and dispersed.</p>
<p>Lecture: Shanghai University has always attached great importance to promoting going to the border areas, and has long had an organization called the Border Problem Research Society. The society heard yesterday that Ms. Liu Manqing, a special investigator sent by the central government to investigate Tibet and Mongolia, had arrived in Shanghai, and specially invited her to give a lecture at the school. First, Mr. Liu Liangmo delivered a speech to introduce her, followed by Ms. Liu's speech, roughly saying, "My trip to Tibet and Mongolia again is to complete the mission of the Republic of China in 1918, to promote the virtue of the central government, to strengthen their inward-looking heart, to consolidate our country, but the disputes in Tibet are still difficult to resolve, and in reality, there is still much isolation, and all the people in Tibet are under the oppression of the Sichuan-Tibet army,</p>
<p>especially in dire straits. In terms of Tibetan education, it is still very young, with no Chinese schools, but recently the Dalai Lama has often sent students to study in the UK, which is quite able to take the best of others and make up for our shortcomings, and his worship of Buddhism, with temples everywhere, is still the same as before. If its folk customs are honest and generous, and its treasures are abundant, and its territory is vast, it is indeed China's natural barrier. The government should find ways to appease it, and not allow it to withdraw from the vassal state, and young people should especially be encouraged to go to Tibet and Mongolia, to open up the intelligence of others and to seek the development of our own careers." The words were very sharp and moving, and the flavor was timeless. It is said that after the lecture, Ms. Liu discussed various issues in Tibet and Mongolia with the students of the school, and gave detailed explanations. By the time the meeting adjourned, the sun had already set.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Willing to Yield the Lotus Pond <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Result of Negotiations with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<p>The British company Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. established a lighter on the Lotus Pond Jiang surface in Zhenjiang, occupying our Jiang surface water rights. This incident occurred in 1915, and it has been more than ten years since then. The water surface rights there belong to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Over the years, negotiations have taken place, but the British company refused to return it. It was not until now that General Manager Li Weihou regained it. The details of this matter are as follows:</p>
<p>The Process of Being Occupied: The British company Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. has the most ships sailing on the Yangtze River, and Zhenjiang is an important commercial port. Ships must dock up and down. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has built a wharf on the Jiang surface, and in front of it is the Lotus Pond, which is the most important area for ship docking. In 1915, the Zhenjiang Customs Superintendent circled the Jiang surface to Jardine Matheson, and the area occupied was huge. Jardine Matheson placed a lighter on the Jiang surface and constructed works. For more than ten years, the Jiang surface there was suddenly occupied by the British company.</p>
<p>Negotiation Situation: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has a large business in Zhenjiang. The Lotus Pond Jiang surface is located in front of the wharf and warehouse, and its water surface rights belong to the company. Since it was occupied by Jardine Matheson, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company negotiated with the British company in 1918 based on reasons, and tried to recover it. At that time, Jardine Matheson claimed that it was assigned by the Customs and not occupied by itself, and refused to return it. When Zhao Tieqiao took office as the Commissioner for Reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in 1930, the old case was brought up again. He sent Section Chief Wang Yunzhang and Shipping Section Chief Wang Pengmeng to negotiate with Jardine Matheson repeatedly, and argued with the Zhenjiang Customs Superintendent. At that time, Jardine Matheson proposed that it could be relocated, but it had to recognize all construction costs, which would cost about 200,000 yuan, and the matter was shelved.</p>
<p>Implementation of Recovery: This time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was reorganized, and Chairman of the Board Li Weihou was transferred to the position of General Manager. After taking office, he checked the handover volumes and found that the Lotus Pond Jiang surface was occupied by foreign companies, which not only affected the company's business, but also hindered national sovereignty. Therefore, General Manager Li still sent Wang Yunzhang to handle the recovery of the Jiang surface. On the one hand, he argued with Zhihe, and on the other hand, he put forward reasons, requesting the Zhenjiang Customs Superintendent to designate a new site for Jardine Matheson's lighter location. After a month, it was finally successful. Now Jardine Matheson has agreed to dismantle the lighter on the Lotus Pond water surface and return it to the company, but the affiliated piles and chains in the lighter's works are priced and bought back by the company, which costs very little. The case, which had been pending for more than ten years, has been resolved at once.</p>

<p>The Ministry of the Navy ordered the Ninghai cruiser from Japan in February of last year. It was launched in Japan on October 10 of last year. Half a year has passed since then, and most of the project has been completed. A few days ago, Deputy Minister of the Navy Li Shijia went to Japan to inspect it,</p>
<p>and returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is scheduled to go to Japan again next week to lead the ship to Shanghai to raise the flag and return to the team. The ship's displacement is 3,000 tons, its length is 330 feet, its width is 39 feet, its draft is 15 feet, its speed is 30 nautical miles per hour, its armament equipment includes main guns of 5.5 inches, three twin-mounted turrets, six 8-inch anti-aircraft guns, two sea searchlights, four torpedo launchers, ten machine guns, and one aircraft.

<h3 id="e168">The Problem of Fire Insurance Compensation in Zhabei <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Scheduled Mediation</p>
<p>Most of the houses in the Zhabei war zone were destroyed during the fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese sides. However, some of them were directly destroyed by artillery fire, but most of them were not directly related to the war. Therefore, the affected households have successively claimed compensation from Chinese and foreign insurance companies. However, the insurance industry stated that this was a war disaster and was not responsible for compensation. Therefore, the affected households organized the Shanghai Municipal Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association to negotiate with Chinese and foreign insurance companies on everything, and also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to uphold justice. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to the Chinese Insurance Industry Association, the He Ming Chamber of Commerce, and the American Chamber of Commerce, etc., requesting that they resolve this matter with a position of justice. The Chinese Industry Association has expressed that it can negotiate with each other. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a formal negotiation on Saturday. As for the foreign companies,</p>
<p>most of the maritime companies are acting as agents, so they must decide after the agent companies have made a decision, and then find a way. Therefore, there has been no considerable reply. Yesterday afternoon at 2 pm, the Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association specially hosted reporters from various newspapers at Yizhixiang Vegetarian Restaurant to report on the progress of this matter.</p>
<p>Reasons for Requesting Compensation: According to the association's lawyer Tang Youwei, the total amount of insurance underwritten by each insurance company is about 13 million taels and 75,000 yuan, with more than 4,200 policyholders. Foreign insurance companies account for nine-tenths, and Chinese insurance companies account for only one-tenth. Among the Chinese companies, the one with the largest amount of insurance underwritten is the Sincere Company. The company has an office in Zhabei. The Commercial Press is covered by the company. The company has a total of more than 1,050 policyholders, and the total amount of compensation is 9.9 million. The policyholders have very sufficient reasons for claiming compensation now: (1) When the war broke out, there was already a sign of danger in Shanghai,</p>
<p>but the insurance companies did not notify the policyholders in advance, stating</p>
<p>that they would not be responsible for ordinary fire insurance; (2) Although some of the houses in the disaster area were directly destroyed by artillery fire, most of the houses were not destroyed by artillery fire, and most of them were burned down. Some of them were burned after our army returned to the station; (3) This disaster is actually a special situation, and the insurance companies should also be responsible for this matter in terms of human relationships.</p>
<p>Now, the people in the Zhabei disaster area are eager for this compensation to wait for the restoration of their businesses.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Promotion Association: The losses of goods and the destruction of industry and commerce suffered by the affected households in the Shanghai-Songhu area are huge and painful, and it is difficult to restore them. The funds for reconstruction and living expenses are the fire insurance compensation for each household. However, the Chinese and Western insurance companies often shirk their responsibilities and delay compensation, so that the affected people's insurance premiums are wasted and the insurance money cannot be obtained. The property is gone and there is no way to appeal. The painful situation is indescribable. The direct victims are the policyholders, but the indirect victims, such as shop clerks and factory workers, are actually ten or hundreds of times more than the policyholders. All of them are becoming unemployed due to the lack of means to recover. The impact on social livelihood is huge and significant. If each insurance company can understand the current situation of the disaster victims in Shanghai and the environment they are in, and establish a foundation for future cooperation with the spirit of benefiting themselves and others, they should have a considerable solution as soon as possible. However, the relocation has been delayed for a long time, and there is still no way. It is not only against human relationships, but also violates precedents. The policyholders are unable to calm their anger and have no way out. They are forced to organize this association. More than 3,000 households gathered without prior agreement, with a total insured amount of more than 10 million. They will unite the strength of the masses to give a considerable response, unite as one, and fight to the end, and will not stop until they achieve their goal. In addition to submitting reports to the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government for filing and relief, we also hope that people from all walks of life will give their sympathy and assistance. This is the declaration, and we only ask for your public judgment.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter Requesting a Crackdown</p>
<h3 id="e170">Wartime New Houses Increase Rent at High Interest Rates <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday, saying, "For the purpose of submitting a letter of request, we received a letter from the Cigarette Exchange Association on the 3rd of this month, stating that according to a letter from Shen Qixiang, the owner of our member Tongmao Tobacco Shop at No. 398, Yongxing Road, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, our shop has been open for 12 years, and the monthly rent is 42 yuan. The house has four rooms, calculated as three rooms, and each room is priced at 14 yuan. The rent has been paid on time every month, and although there is no deposit, it has never been in arrears. During the January 28th Incident this year, all businesses were closed, and countless houses in the war zone were burned down. Our shop was burned down by a fire in the neighboring shop on the evening of March 11th, becoming a wasteland. All the goods and property in the shop were lost, amounting to more than 10,000 yuan. At that time, our shop declared to the landlord that the new house would still be rented by our shop after it was completed, and the landlord agreed. Now that the house has been built, our shop went to rent it, but the landlord repeatedly shirked, and finally replied that the rent must be 160 yuan per month, and an additional deposit of 1,500 yuan must be paid. Our shop was extremely shocked to hear this. The rent has increased nearly four times, and a huge deposit must be paid, which is beyond reason. Considering that our shop has suffered huge losses due to the impact of the war, we are planning to resume business and take measures to make up for our losses. Now, the landlord does not add sympathy and does not care about the old relationship</p>
<p>, and wants to increase the rent arbitrarily and add a deposit of 1,500 yuan, which makes our shop unable to afford it and unable to resume business. The losses are unimaginable. How can our shop bear this? We ask your association to uphold justice and give us assistance, so that our shop can continue to rent, resume business, and be extremely grateful." The above-mentioned information has been reported to the association. It has been found that the landlord should add sympathy for the tenant who has lived there for 12 years, and now he does not care about the old friendship and increases the rent arbitrarily by as much as four times, and also adds a huge amount of deposit of 1,500 yuan, which makes the shop unable to afford it, which is beyond reason. Moreover, the shop has suffered huge</p>
<p>losses and urgently needs to restore its old business to maintain its livelihood. Approved the letter for the aforementioned reason, and especially report the situation and ask your association to understand the difficulties of the merchants and give them assistance quickly to promote public friendship, etc. It has been found that the losses suffered by the stores and residents in the Shanghai-Songhu war zone are extremely serious, and it is necessary to plan for the labor to settle down and cultivate vitality. The landlords are also expending a lot of effort to build new houses in various places where their houses have been burned down, and they must raise capital. However, as the association said, the rent is increased by as much as four times according to the original rent, and a huge amount of deposit that has never been charged before is added, which is inevitable to take advantage of the danger and invite profits, making it impossible for the shops that have survived the disaster to resume business. It is feared that such a situation will lead to imitation in the future, and it will not only be the landlord's family who will do so. It is reasonable to prepare a document and submit it to your government for review, and for all the newly built houses that have been destroyed in the war zone, fair and appropriate measures should be stipulated for the lease, and proper crackdowns should be carried out, so that the survivors after the disaster can have a chance to rest, which is really convenient for the public.</p>
<p>Pudong Rent Reduction Association</p>
<h3 id="e171">Petition to Party and Government Organs Today <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The citizens of Pudong established the Pudong District Rent Reduction Movement Committee after the establishment of the Special Economic Zone, and are using the dilapidated Nani Du Zhiyang Temple as their office. The committee has decided to dispatch representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government of this city today to petition for rent reduction. The submitted petition is recorded below: Petition for rent reduction. We, the hundreds of thousands of citizens of the Pudong District, live in small spaces, repairing windows and doors. Considering the increasing population in recent years, soaring rents, and landlords hoarding and exerting pressure, it leads to tens of thousands of</p>
<p>mansions, only hurting the hearts of the poor scholars. Even a small hut is a source of despair for the people, with no one to rely on.</p>
<p>What could be more unfair than this? This year, the Japanese invaders committed crimes, and prosperity turned to ruins. In the corner of Pudong, factories closed their doors, all industries stagnated, and citizens fled in panic, leaving nine out of ten houses empty. The intangible losses are even greater than the tangible ones. Although an agreement has been reached recently, the vitality has been completely destroyed, refugees fill the roads, and thousands of families cry in the wilderness. All of this is obvious to everyone. However, the landlords do not offer any sympathy, and even want to destroy the house to take the young, exhaust the pond to get the fish, forcing the payment of rent with urgent speed, or demanding eviction, or suing in court, layer upon layer of oppression, acting recklessly. How can the survivors of the disaster endure this? The committee witnessed this situation and was heartbroken. Therefore, it specifically lists the following circumstances and submits them to your esteemed government (department), hoping that you will be concerned about the people's suffering and quickly issue a clear order to exempt all rents in the district for February and March during the war, and pay 40% of the original rent for April. This method will not cause much loss to the landlords, and will slightly alleviate the burden on the tenants. It will end the conflicts like rats and birds, and permanently maintain the good relationship between landlords and tenants. We urgently submit this petition, earnestly requesting your esteemed council to consider the situation and implement it as soon as possible. We will be eternally grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Lawsuit Against Tenant for Rent Arrears <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Chou Chin Yao An Lee Company takes the brunt</p>
<p>This matter has attracted considerable attention in general society.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of citizens in this city requesting rent reduction for February and March, many landlords have already filed lawsuits against their tenants. Recently, Haddon &amp; Co. filed a case against An Lee Cosmetics Company, a tenant in Chou Chin Lane, San Ma Road, for rent arrears, applying for provisional seizure in the First Special Court. This matter has attracted considerable attention in society. It is reported that An Lee Company, due to the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, went on strike to resist the enemy, and business was completely suspended. Therefore, based on the situation in the city, they requested a postponement of rent payment for February and March from the landlord. They were willing to pay the remaining part in advance, but the landlord refused to accept it. Later, the store entrusted lawyer Lee Chun-huan to make the payment on their behalf, but it was still rejected. They also provided a guarantee of 500 yuan and directly applied to the local court for provisional seizure. However, the store has a well-established reputation, and they also provided 750 taels of cash as security for the record. In the future, the plaintiff should file a lawsuit within the time limit to resolve this case. However, the tenant believes that the rent arrears this time are not due to non-payment. In addition to responding to the lawsuit through a lawyer, they have also sent a letter to the Haddon Tenants' Association and other groups, requesting assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Wusong Specifies Road Widths <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Attention to Builders</p>
<p>After the takeover of Wusong, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works has sent personnel to Wusong to re-plan the roads and establish sample piles, so that residents' buildings will not protrude onto the roads and hinder traffic. In the Wai Ma Road area, before the Japanese troops withdrew, peddlers occupied the roads and built makeshift lead houses, which have now been ordered to be demolished. However, for the houses completed in the town's streets before the sample piles were set, even if they do not comply with the new regulations, they only need to provide a guarantee and apply to the Wusong Municipal Committee Office for a supplementary license, which can be handled with leniency to show sympathy. In the future, residents must obtain a license before starting construction. The road widths of the entire town are surveyed as follows: Wai Ma Road 18 meters, Songxing Road, Zhongxin Road, Huanzhen Road, Dongxin Road, and Xianliang Road 10 meters, Tongxing Road 7.5 meters, Yutong Road 7.1 meters, Hefeng Road, Guizhi Road, Doushi Road, Hongyuan Road, Hefeng Road, Tongtai Road, Peiji Road, Nanchang Road, Wenchang Road, and Zhenwu Road are all 6 meters, Nanshihe Road and Beishihe Road 5.5 meters, Jintai Road, Sanyi Road, and Liji Road 5 meters, Xi'an Road, Sanyang Road, Quangui Road, Changchun Road, and Guihua Lane 4.5 meters.</p>
<p>Shipping Guild Telegraphs the Executive Yuan</p>
<h3 id="e174">Request to Reduce Vessel Registration Fees <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, for requesting a reduction in the registration fees for newly purchased vessels and exemption from mortgage registration fees, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications yesterday, saying: To the esteemed Executive Yuan in Nanjing, based on the joint statement of the member companies, in accordance with the provisions of the Vessel Registration Law, all shipping merchants, regardless of whether they are newly built or purchased vessels, must pay a registration fee of 4 per mille of the vessel's value according to Article 62, Paragraph 3. Furthermore, if the vessel is mortgaged, a registration fee of 2 per mille of the debt amount must be paid according to Paragraph 5 of the same article. Both burdens are excessively heavy. It is found that the shipping industry is a tool for foreign commercial warfare and maintaining transportation, and its rise and fall are related to international prestige. Therefore, all countries in the world take encouragement and maintenance as their purpose, either lending huge sums or providing appropriate subsidies. Seeing the persistence of the great powers in maintaining our country's shipping rights and their unwillingness to relax, the importance of the relationship is already known. Our country's commercial shipping, restricted by unequal treaties, is extremely immature. In order to meet the needs of resisting foreign vessels and preparing for the recovery of shipping rights, it is necessary to gradually add considerable vessels. Therefore, the Maintenance of Shipping Industry Law has special provisions, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications have repeatedly ordered to plan and prepare. At present, the number of heavy-tonnage vessels added by Chinese merchants is increasing day by day. Now that gold is expensive and silver is cheap, the purchase price is high. It is already extremely difficult to raise the vessel price. However, the registration fee must be paid at 4 per mille of the vessel's value, and the burden is so heavy that it is no different from blocking the path for Chinese people to raise funds to purchase vessels, which is contrary to the purpose of maintenance, encouragement, promotion, and preparation. This is one. The financial situation of shipping merchants is extremely difficult, which is known to all and cannot be concealed. It was already foreseen early on. Although we had repeatedly appealed last year, and your esteemed Yuan had approved the issuance of 10 million yuan of public bonds to maintain the shipping industry, the Ministry of Finance has not yet faithfully implemented it. Like quenching thirst with plums, we are eagerly waiting. Unexpectedly, natural disasters and foreign troubles have repeatedly multiplied, and the decline in the shipping merchants' business and the magnitude of the losses are unprecedented. It is inevitable that they will go bankrupt. Therefore, they have to bow their heads and swallow their voices, asking people to intercede and borrowing money to finance the vessels, which is increasing day by day. The matter is out of necessity, and the situation is very pitiful. However, the mortgage registration requires paying a registration fee of 2 per mille of the debt amount, which is no different from adding another blow to those who are drinking poison to quench their thirst. Moreover, during the era when the customs office was in charge of shipping administration, no fees were charged for the registration of vessel mortgages. It is true that all countries have no precedent for this. Therefore, the foreign customs officers followed the good laws of their own country to benefit the shipping merchants. Now that the person in charge has changed, the burden has actually increased. In the future, compared to the past, it will not only make people sigh that they are better here than there, but it will also be ridiculed for being contrary to the law on maintaining the shipping industry. This is two. The association is a shipping merchant organization. For all sufferings, we have no choice but to appeal on their behalf, and as fellow citizens, we have the obligation to state the facts. Therefore, we urgently request your esteemed Yuan to uphold the law on maintaining the shipping industry and the original intention of maintaining commercial shipping, and to order the Ministry of Communications to instruct all shipping administrations to reduce the fee for the registration of newly built or purchased vessels to 2 per mille of the vessel's value, and to exempt the fee for the registration of vessel mortgages, or to charge the fee according to the temporary registration example, in order to show promotion and support. Shipping rights are fortunate, and the shipping industry is fortunate. We urgently await your orders, Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, Chairman Yu Hede bows, Qi.</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Ministry of Finance Cables to Abolish Anhui Province's Egg Tax Bureau <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Egg Industry Association received a quick telegram from the Ministry of Finance of the National Government yesterday, coded as Fu Zi No. 272, which stated: To the Shanghai Egg Industry Association, we have read the telegram from Ma. We have checked this case. According to the telegram from the Shanghai Egg Factory Association, the province has set up a bureau to collect egg tax, and we respectfully request that it be transferred to abolish it. We have already ordered the Anhui Finance Department to comply with the business tax rate approved by the Ministry of Finance and abolish the Egg Tax Bureau. We have reported the record, so we will immediately inform you, Ministry of Finance, seal.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Still Handled by the Ministry <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Order No. 86 states: Based on the telegram from the Ministry of Finance's Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Division, we have read the telegram with respect. We have checked the case of the Jiangsu tobacco and alcohol license tax. Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Government had requested in the Tanri telegram to directly reorganize it, and on the same day, we ordered the Finance Department to send personnel to various counties to collect the tax and directly deposit it into the provincial treasury. The Ministry found that the license tax has always been collected directly by the central government, and all provinces have followed it uniformly. Moreover, Article 1 of the Business Tax Law promulgated by the National Government also clearly stipulates that it is a central collection, and it is closely related to the reorganization of the tobacco and alcohol production and sales tax. It is difficult to divide it. The Ministry has previously replied to the Yangri telegram to cancel the original proposal in order to avoid disputes and has also presented a petition to the Executive Yuan to order a prohibition. Based on the previous situation, we must immediately instruct all the relevant license tax sub-bureaus to continue to handle the matter as before, to conduct thorough inspections, and to comply with the original plan. This is extremely important. In response to this, we checked the newspapers and, based on the reports submitted by the various tobacco and alcohol license tax sub-bureaus, we telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to inform the Jiangsu Provincial Government to cancel the previous order. On the one hand, we instructed the sub-bureaus to inform the tobacco and alcohol merchants to collect and pay taxes as usual. Now, based on the previous reasons, in addition to issuing it separately, we hereby order the sub-bureaus to comply with the processing of the farmland, and this order is urgent.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association convened a joint meeting of the northern and southern industries at the Cuixiu Hall in the Yimiao Temple yesterday afternoon to discuss the following important proposals: (1) The method for settling outstanding accounts in the northern and southern rice industries. It was resolved that all outstanding accounts should be urged by their respective industries and settled by the end of June at the latest. If the deadline is exceeded, the association should be notified, and the association will notify the industry. If the account of a Jia firm is owed to an Yi firm, the account of the Jia firm can be directly collected from the Yi firm. (2) Postponement of the implementation of the new measuring instruments. It was resolved that, according to the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the new system of weights and measures must be implemented on July 1 this year. The industry believes that at this time of year when the old grain has run out and the new crop has not yet been harvested, and after the war, the industry's business has not yet recovered to its original state, the implementation will have a significant impact. It was decided that the association will petition the authorities to allow the extension of the implementation to February 1, 1922.</p>

<p>The Haddon estate case resumed yesterday morning at the British Consular Court. First, a Jewish legal expert explained Jewish law. If</p>
<p>after a Jew dies, he leaves his property to his wife or one of his children, then the inheritor is only considered a guardian of the family's interests. Furthermore, if a Jew marries a non-Jew, it is not recognized by law. Then, the chairman of the Jewish Association and the editor-in-chief of the Jewish newspaper were called to explain the Jewish funeral rituals, and testified regarding Haddon's funeral and the separate chanting of scriptures by monks and Taoists to commemorate him. Next, the vice-rector of the Jewish church, Ah Baila Han, testified that Falouyi recalled that the deceased had given 750 yuan to the plaintiff, Yishila Haddon,</p>
<p>instructing her to leave Shanghai. When the court convened in the afternoon, the testimony focused on the religious status of Haddon and his wife and their marriage.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Aftermath of Newspaper Workers' Strike Yesterday's Report <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Arrested More Than Twenty Workers</p>
<p>An Important Meeting Was Held the Night Before, and the Situation Was Very Serious</p>
<p>The Newspaper Workers' Union issued a message stating that since the Shanghai newspaper industry declared a strike on the 1st of this month at the Shenxin Shishi Sanbao (Shen Bao, Xin Bao, Shishi Xin Bao) to support the workers of the Shishi Xin Bao who were forced to leave the newspaper, Mr. Du Yuesheng came forward to mediate. The union, considering the good intentions of the third party and the importance of social news, agreed to the Shenxin Shishi Sanbao resuming work first. The issue of the Shishi Xin Bao firing workers</p>
<p>Mr. Du was responsible for negotiating, as detailed in the previous report. As of the day before yesterday, when there were still no concrete results, suddenly at 6:00 pm on the day before yesterday (the 8th), the Shishi Xin Bao management instigated the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team to send a large number of detectives to the union's headquarters, arresting more than twenty workers of the Shishi Xin Bao who had been fired, and destroying all the union's equipment and belongings. After the union heard about this, it convened an emergency meeting on the night of the 8th. Everyone said that the Shishi Xin Bao management had fired the workers, and after two months, there had been no results. The workers had suffered the pain of unemployment, and now they were suffering this unwarranted disaster. The Shishi Xin Bao management was really too cruel. The emotions were aroused, and the situation was tense. Several concrete measures were discussed and decided (temporarily not announced). Yesterday (the 9th), the union immediately sent representatives with a petition to the Municipal Government's Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters, demanding the release of the arrested workers and the thorough investigation of the person who instigated the destruction. At the same time, they went to the offices of He Xiangning, a member of the Central Committee, and Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan,</p>
<p>Petitioning to find a way to release the arrested workers. The results were all promising releases. Yesterday, the union also issued the following declaration: Compatriots, working brothers, since our Newspaper Workers' Union was openly destroyed and oppressed by the capitalists of the Shishi Xin Bao, the wounds and pain we have suffered are truly countless. However, in order to uphold justice and fairness, and in order to protect our own vital interests, even if we have to sacrifice everything, we will still resist them resolutely and will never retreat. On April 2, the Shishi Xin Bao capitalists</p>
<p>forced the workers to print the Da Wan Bao, causing a conflict that led to the dismissal of all the workers. This, on the part of the capitalists, is a kind of politically provocative method.</p>
<p>Therefore, there were thorough preparations in advance and proper arrangements afterwards, causing dozens of workers to suffer unemployment and the entire organization to be destroyed. Afterwards, despite our repeated negotiations and the efforts of various unions to help, the Shishi Xin Bao authorities did not retreat in the slightest. In their consistent strategy, it is very clear that they will never stop until they destroy our entire union organization. Therefore, in order to protect ourselves, we had this alliance strike on June 1st. After the strike,</p>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng came out to mediate. At that time, we also recognized Mr. Du's good-faith mediation and unanimously resumed work. However, how could we know that our resumption of work was originally to prevent the unrest from expanding, but the Shishi Xin Bao capitalists, seeing that we had already resumed work, not only insisted on their original strategy of destroying us, but also intensified their efforts. On the one hand, they falsely accused some workers who were working of being troublemakers and colluded with the patrol house to arrest them. On the other hand, they joined forces with the Public Security Bureau and sent a large number of armed detectives to the union's headquarters at 6:00 pm on the day before yesterday (the 8th). Without asking the reasons, they arrested all twenty-two workers of the Shishi Xin Bao who had been forced to leave the newspaper, including Wang Ke Gang, and destroyed all the arrangements in the union. This kind of unreasonable and violent act was openly staged in Shanghai in broad daylight, and it was carried out by the Chinese authorities. It is so painful and indignant for us to say it. Thinking about the distant and recent causes of this labor unrest, it was entirely created by the Shishi Xin Bao authorities. In order to protect ourselves, we had no choice but to resort to this final measure. The Shishi Xin Bao capitalists did not hesitate to attack us again and again. We are at a critical juncture of life and death. If the authorities still favor the Shishi Xin Bao, abuse their power, and destroy the labor movement, then we will only use all our strength to fight them in a final battle. Compatriots, workers, we have been oppressed and can no longer tolerate it. In order to survive, we have no choice but to embark on the road of struggle. We hope that we will be given strong assistance in this struggle. Shanghai Newspaper Workers' Union, June 9th.</p>

<h3 id="e183">National Disaster Relief Association Opposes Banning Traffickers of Opium Slaves <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu National Disaster Relief Association telegraphed Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Military Committee Chairman Chiang yesterday, opposing the military's package distribution of opium soil. The esteemed government, considering the importance of river defense and coastal defense, specially ordered the 25th Route Army to be stationed in various counties in northern Jiangsu. Time flies, and it has been two years. Commander Liang has strict discipline in governing the army, which is admired by everyone. Last autumn, the troops stationed in Huai'an built dams to prevent floods, and the people of Dadian were especially grateful. However, it has recently been heard that the troops stationed in various counties often set up inspection offices to collect opium losses. As a result, local hoodlums take advantage of the name to extort money and distribute opium soil and red and white pills. The good people have suffered greatly, and public opinion is boiling everywhere. Our association,</p>
<p>after repeatedly receiving notices from various parties, is terrified and cannot help but feel sad and indignant. Opium and red and white pills are a disaster for the country and its people, and are truly related to the future survival of our Chinese nation. The esteemed government, in order to maintain the health of the nation and respect the public opinion of the people,</p>
<p>considering the international reputation, is now making every effort to strictly prohibit it. The national army is under the jurisdiction of the government and is responsible for defending the country. Under the clear sky, how can there be national defense soldiers doing things that undermine the foundation of the country? Commander Liang's virtuous reputation is well-known. No matter how we speculate, we cannot believe that these abnormal actions would come from the 25th Route Army, which the people believe in. Or it is said that because the defense area is vast and the people are uneven, it is difficult to ensure that there are no a few officers and adjutants who are negligent for a while and collude with petty people, which leads to the violation of the law and conscience. If so, then they are a scourge and tarnish the reputation of the national army, and should be given appropriate punishment to serve as a warning. Or it is said that the 25th Route Army, because the government's military pay cannot be issued on time, and the hungry army is waiting for food, it is urgent to set up a levy. This statement is not true and we dare not know, but according to common sense, the government takes taxes from the people to meet the national needs, and the needs of the national army should be taken from the national treasury. The budget is listed in the book, and all are aware of it. If the government's military pay is short, and the garrison is allowed to raise funds on the spot without limitation, the people's pain will be deeper, and the national discipline will be worse. What kind of governance system will it become? It is enough to make this kind of speculation unworthy of deep belief. However, it is believed that various counties in northern Jiangsu suffered unprecedented floods last year, and the land is full of devastation. This spring, it has been indirectly affected by the war and is even more exhausted. How should the government entrusted by our people and the national defense army directly under the government be merciful to the dying and helpless people? It is inappropriate to ignore them, and how can we bear to trample them? The 25th Route Army is stationed in various counties in northern Jiangsu. Are there any offices set up to collect donations? Is the government's military pay not being issued on time? And how many months are needed for the officers and soldiers of the 25th Route Army? How much is the pay needed? The people of Jiangsu have suffered greatly, and the doubts are not resolved. We dare to drink tears and blood, regardless of death, and beg the public officials of the esteemed government to grant a thorough investigation and a clear declaration, so that our dying people</p>
<p>know clearly where the truth lies, so that even if they encounter misfortune, wait for rescue indefinitely, and have no way to save themselves, they will be fortunate to know the reason for their death, and death may be relieved. Urgent telegrams, five hearts are broken, district district lower hearts, begging the original of the merchant, Jiangsu Provincial National Disaster Relief Association.</p>

<p>Notice from the Mechanical Federation</p>
<p>The Mechanical Federation issued a notice saying, Respectfully, the trademark is the reason for highlighting products and is of the utmost importance. I do not know how many cases of my country's industrial and commercial industries have been adopted in the past few decades. Since there has been no statistical compilation, all parties are unable to ask about it when using domestic goods. This is what the Association should strive to offer to society. Now, the China Economic Society's Shanghai Branch is compiling a "China-Japan Trade Research Institute Work Manual", which contains a rich collection of content and accurate research. It is the most valuable masterpiece for studying Sino-Japanese business. It will be published soon. Among them, the "National Goods Trademark" item plans to search for the names and patterns of national goods trademarks in order to compare and refer to foreign goods trademarks. This matter concerns industrial and commercial interests, and it is specially notified to all industrial and commercial industries in this port and other ports. Please submit the names, patterns, and products used for national goods trademarks, as well as the status of registration, in detail within five days to the "National Goods Trademark Collection Office, Shanghai Beile Road Mechanical Federation". Please send the industries in other ports to the conference within ten days for forwarding, so that you will not look forward and miss the opportunity. I am very grateful for this special notice to all industries and factories in this port and other ports.</p>

<p>Gao Qianlong Reports Theft</p>
<p>Gatekeepers All Deny Involvement</p>
<p>Gao Qianlong, a 40-year-old Ningbo native who runs a small teahouse at 15 Guoxiang Lane, Hengtong Road, Zhabei, went to the Second Section of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau, Qiuan Lane Police Station (formerly the original location of the Second Section of the Fourth District) yesterday at around 11:00 AM to report that when the Japanese troops ravaged Zhabei the other day and the 19th Route Army retreated to the second line of defense, a patrolman surnamed Chen left a rifle and a pistol, along with more than ten rows of bullets, at his shop. Fearing that the Japanese soldiers would find out and it would be detrimental to him, he hid the rifle inside the roof tiles and the pistol and bullets in the ditch at the entrance. At the time, only Xu Renhuai, Wu Jiuguan, patrolmen working as gatekeepers in a certain concession, and Lu Zixi, the gatekeeper in Guoxiang Lane, saw it. Now, all the firearms and ammunition have disappeared. He suspects they were stolen by Xu and the other two. After receiving the report, the police station dispatched several officers led by Police Chief Cai to arrest Xu, Wu, and Lu. After a brief interrogation at the station, they were sent to the Second Section. According to the plaintiff's statement to Section Chief Han Tiexian, it was roughly as described above. However, the defendant Xu Renhuai, 39 years old, from Yancheng, and Wu Jiuguan, also 39 years old, from Ningbo, and Lu Zixi, 62 years old, from Haimen, all claimed that Gao Qianlong was making a false accusation out of spite and denied stealing the guns and ammunition. After reviewing the statements, the section chief deemed the case important and ordered them to be transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Li Zhixiang, also known as Li Lipi, a robber from Hunan province, 31 years old, colluded with others in April of this year to rob passengers of their belongings on a small steamboat in Paotaiwan, Wujiang County, using weapons and kidnapping 23 hostages.

The Third District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police issued a wanted notice and sent Detective Wan Zhinan to Shanghai to conduct a secret investigation. On the 8th (the day before yesterday) at 1:00 PM, Li was spotted by Detective Wan as he was passing the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Shangxian Lane in the French Concession. Wan immediately called for Officer No. 101 and arrested Li, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Second Special Court. At 2:00 PM, Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case, stating that the defendant had colluded with others to commit robbery in the interior, robbing a small boat, kidnapping people, resisting arrest, and killing government officials. The Water Police had sent a detective to Shanghai to arrest the defendant and hand him over. The police station did not object to the transfer. Detective Wan Zhinan of the Public Security Bureau also submitted an official document stating the case and requesting permission to transfer the case for investigation. The defendant's statement was evasive. After reviewing the statements, Judge Xiong ruled that Li Zhixiang should be handed over to the Third District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Department detectives to be taken back for investigation.</p>

<p>Yu Shengshan Blames It on Lies</p>
<p>Yu Shengshan from Liuhe and Li Zicai from Wuxi wrote threatening letters between May 21st and June 1st and delivered them to Hu Yueshan, the owner of Xintai (i.e., Xintai Electrical Materials Factory) at 210 Glen Road, Yangshupu, extorting 10,000 yuan, claiming to be the Preparatory Office for the Southeast Self-Defense Army. They demanded a meeting at the Xietu Road bridge at the junction of the Chinese and French concessions, threatening to bomb the factory or kill Hu and his four brothers as reactionaries. The language was harsh. Shen Yuzhou and Shan Zhaoxian, Chinese detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station, arrested and detained Yu and Li in the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiao Wanxuan continued the trial in the First High Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the threatening letter was written by the fugitive main culprit Zhang Dongsheng.</p>
<p>It was written by someone surnamed Jia who set up a fortune-telling stall on Dagu Road. The draft was written by the defendant Li Zicai. He then submitted the letter for inspection. The plaintiff Hu Yueshan claimed that he did not know either of the defendants. He received the threatening letter on the 27th of last month. The next morning, he reported it to the police station. The police station then dispatched Qian Wancai and a police detective to the designated meeting place. He did not go with them. Qian Wancai then stated that he was waiting near the Xietu Road bridge when the defendant Yu San Yi arrived. He spoke with him. Yu said, "How much money did you bring today?" Qian told him that they had to negotiate before arranging a place to hand over the money. He was then arrested by the police detective. When questioned, Yu Shengshan completely denied his previous admission that he conspired with Li Zicai, directed him to go to the meeting place to receive the money, and his statements to the police station, claiming that they were all lies and not voluntary. Li</p>
<p>Zicai also denied it and hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to defend him. Judge Qiao ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>Jiang Yusheng Confirms Identity as Son and Claims Body</p>
<p>On the evening of the 7th of this month at 7:00 PM, Yao Guanfeng (i.e., Jiang Guifang), a 19-year-old from Huzhou, went to the Tongfa Inn on Qipu Road alone. After booking Room 5, he took poison. The next morning, Zhao Afu, a tea server at the inn, discovered him and reported it to the accounting office, which then reported it to the Hui Si police station, ordering detectives to investigate. A suicide note was found near his body, stating that he was tired of life due to prolonged unemployment and financial difficulties. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment but died. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the office. They determined that the body was placed in a public space. Zhao Afu stated that after the deceased booked the room, he asked him to make tea and then went to sleep. The next morning, at around 11:00 AM, he went to wake him up and saw him moaning in bed. He then reported it to the accounting office. Jiang Yusheng, 46 years old, a silk merchant living at 17 Rehe Road, stated that the deceased was indeed his son. The name Yao Guanfeng was a pseudonym. His real name was Jiang Guifang. He could not determine if the handwriting on the letter was his because he was often away from home. Guo concluded that the deceased Jiang Guifang had indeed died from poisoning himself before his death. The body was handed over to his father, Jiang Yusheng, to arrange for the coffin and burial.</p>

<p>People in Pudong Are Buzzing</p>
<p>Brothers Kill Older Brother</p>
<p>Zhang Linsheng, the deceased horse racing head from Huayuanshi Bridge, Pudong, was involved in a property dispute, leading to internal strife. Zhang’s third son, Zhang Qingxiang, and his maternal uncle, Zhang Quansheng, shot and killed his older brother, Zhang Yuxiang, and his half-brother, Zhang Guoxiang. Since the incident, Zhang Qingxiang, Zhang Jinsheng, and their mother, Zhang Ershi, have been arrested and detained by the court for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Shen Youqi of the District Court held another hearing, questioning witnesses from both sides. According to Gu Chenshi, Zhang Qingxiang came to look for Guoxiang around 5:00 PM before the incident, but did not meet him and left. According to Zhang Achuan, who lived in the same house as Gu Chenshi, her testimony was similar. According to Lu Dingshi, a tenant of Gu Chenshi, her testimony was the same. The security chief Xie Along stated that he reported the examination of the case, but the details were not clear. Zhu Shangzhi, the platoon leader of the Tangqiao Security Regiment, now a squad leader, stated that Zhang Quansheng was formerly a member of the team. He did not actually understand what happened after Zhang Yuxiang was killed, but people were buzzing, saying that the brothers killed their older brother. Zhang Qingxiang's witness Sheng Jinsheng stated that he got married recently. On the day of the incident, September 22nd of last year, Zhang Qingxiang, Zhu Jinlong, and Zhang Liugen came to his house at around 8:00 AM and played mahjong until around 4:00 PM. Qingxiang's mother-in-law came to call him and told him not to gamble. At that time, there were still two rounds of mahjong, so they dispersed at around 5:00 PM. He did not know where Qingxiang went, but he saw him heading south. He did not ask him. They did not know his mother-in-law and did not know how she got to his house. Zhu Jinlong and Zhang Liugen gave similar testimony, but said that Zhang Qingxiang's mother-in-law came at 5:00 PM and called him for dinner, and did not say anything else.</p>
<p>There were only two decks of cards, etc. Qiu Asong, the security chief of the 16th map of Tangqiao, stated that on September 22nd, Zhang Quansheng had a dispute with a neighbor over land rent, which he mediated. He and Yan Zilin left together in the evening, and he left first. Chen Kunlin stated that he lived next door to Zhang Quansheng. On September 22nd, he saw Quansheng and Yan Zilin eating dinner and washing their faces. Zhang Quansheng's wife, Shen, said that after her husband was arrested, she hid the pistol in the stove out of fear. Unexpectedly, the stepdaughter burned it while cooking. Later, the stepdaughter buried it in the ashes. She did not know the stepdaughter's name. At this point, the official said that the case was generally clear and agreed to the lawyer's request to schedule a debate.</p>

<p>Xu Juzhen, a 19-year-old woman from Ningbo, lingered at the Sincere Company on the morning of the 6th of this month, seemingly waiting for someone. After being questioned by Jin Dingcai, an employee of the company, it was learned that she was lost. Jin Dingcai then accompanied her to the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Association, requesting a decision. The association inquired with her in detail. She said that her father's name was Xu Yaoqing and her mother was Cao. In February of last year, she married Li Wenji, who worked as a teacher in Hongquan Street, North City, Pudong. Her parents-in-law had passed away. Because her husband was addicted to opium, she was in a difficult situation and came to Shanghai from her hometown to borrow money from her older sister Xiuzhen, who lived near the Shangjiayuan, Baike Road, near Gongping Lane, to redeem her belongings. However, her sister had moved. Her brother-in-law, Zhao Zufang, worked at a printing press on Sanma Road, but she did not know the name of the printing press. The association sent the woman to the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association for temporary care and to search for her relatives to claim her.</p>

<p>Huang Wendong, courtesy name Weichun, graduated from the Shanghai Chinese Medicine College in the 10th year of the Republic (1921). He later studied with the famous doctor Ding Ganren and mastered the medical theory and experience. He served in various Chinese medicine hospitals in Shanghai with outstanding achievements. In the 16th year of the Republic (1927), he returned to his hometown of Nanxun, saving countless lives. Last summer, Ding Jiwan also served as the president of the Chinese Medicine College, recruiting talents and doing his best. He once said that he would benefit greatly if he could get Huang. Therefore, he urged him repeatedly in special letters. Huang was grateful for his appreciation and thought that the students' future achievements were immeasurable, so he resolutely accepted the appointment and served as a professor of typhoid fever, herbal medicine, and pediatrics, which was highly respected by the students. They asked him to open a clinic in his spare time to treat the people's diseases. Huang agreed and started seeing patients at No. 1 Jiazhili, Menghua Street, inside the Old West Gate, after 1:00 PM every day, starting on June 6th. May his medical care be widely received,</p>

<h3 id="e205">Three-Year Construction Plan for Jiangsu Province <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>I believe that the Premier's (Sun Yat-Sen's) teachings emphasize construction above all else. Since the founding of the Party-State, the National Construction Commission at the national level, the Construction Department at the provincial level, the Public Works Bureau at the municipal level, and the Construction Bureau at the county level have all been responsible for striving to make progress, striving to fulfill the Premier's grand vision of "everyone makes the most of their talent, every piece of land makes the most of its value, every object makes the most of its use, and every commodity flows smoothly." Jiangsu Province protects the capital (Nanjing) and borders Shanghai, acting as a national hub for transportation. It is not only a political center and a commercial hub, but also has developed agriculture and industry. Academia is also prosperous. The climate is suitable, the scenery is beautiful, and the humanities and geography are renowned in the Southeast. In terms of construction, it is more urgent than other provinces. The Construction Department of this province has been established for five years, and has had several leaders, all of whom have made remarkable achievements. My (Dong Xiujia's) knowledge and experience are far inferior to those of my predecessors, but I was mistakenly entrusted with serving my hometown. I will encourage each other in our hometown to maintain our integrity, follow the old rules, and be diligent and careful for the past four months. However, the country is currently in a difficult situation, and the province's finances have been severely affected, almost reaching exhaustion. Furthermore, after the floods, the Yun embankments, sea dikes, and embankments of dozens of counties collapsed at the same time, all of which need to be repaired in a timely manner. In addition, due to the importance of national defense, military roads and telecommunications projects in various places must also be completed on schedule. All of these must be done simultaneously in the shortest possible time. However, while it is difficult to pre-determine a direction for temporary work, daily progress cannot be without a procedure. It should be noted that the period of tutelage is expected to last for six years,</p>
<p>More than half of which has now passed, leaving only the last three years to plan for construction. The overall facilities are urgent and busy, and it is well known that completion is not easy. However, in the face of difficulties, if there is no spirit of struggling to achieve success, it seems to be losing the original purpose of construction. Based on what the Construction Department is responsible for, such as water conservancy, highways, telecommunications, navigation, municipal administration, and provincial capital construction, there are six major points. To enumerate their details,</p>
<p>The management of the Yun River, dredging ports, repairing rivers, building embankments, dike construction,  construction, pond construction, and gate construction all belong to water conservancy. Roadbed, pavement, bridges, culverts, land acquisition, price payment, relocation, compensation, all belong to highways. Provincial long-distance telephone, provincial automatic telephone, provincial radio stations, broadcasting equipment, and the management of various privately-run electrical businesses, all belong to telecommunications. Suppressing inland river shipping, reorganizing river traffic,</p>
<p>All belong to navigation. Reorganizing the streets of all counties, opening parks in all counties, suppressing municipal buildings, adding artesian wells in various places, managing merchant vegetable farms in all counties, and facilitating human-powered vehicles all belong to municipal administration.</p>
<p>As for prospering the provincial capital, repairing roads and bridges, reorganizing vehicle traffic, planning and building Xiangshan port, embellishing urban and rural scenery, and building public housing, all belong to provincial capital construction. All of the above are under the scope of our responsibility. If we want to implement these policies effectively, we must first have a meticulous plan, a sequence of priorities, and a predetermined timetable. Otherwise, those involved will lose their bearings, and those outside will be unable to understand what is going on. This is why the Construction Department's three-year plan must be disclosed in advance so that we can urge progress on schedule. In order to plan for future facilities, review past history, and perceive the difficulties of progress, there are further remarks that I hope people from all over the country will understand. Since the establishment of the Construction Department, the heads of the department have changed several times, and the organization has been repeatedly</p>
<p>changed. Previously, the water conservancy organs originally had the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Office, located in Yangzhou, engaged in canal work, and the province set up a Water Conservancy Bureau to supervise it. In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Yangzhou Engineering Office was merged into the Water Conservancy Bureau. After the floods, a portion was split off from the Water Conservancy Bureau to form the Jiangbei Canal Closure Engineering Office. In the winter of that year, the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Aftermath Committee was established. Regarding sea dikes, there was originally the Jiangnan Sea Dike Office, which was later abolished and divided into Baotai Song three counties, with the heads of the Construction Bureaus of the three counties concurrently holding responsibility. Recently, the Jiangnan Dike Engineering Aftermath Committee was jointly formed by the province and the city. This is the situation regarding the organizational changes of the Water Conservancy Bureau. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Shan Liao</p>
<p>! The weather is getting warmer, and summer clothes must be prepared; the material for summer clothes must be domestic goods, otherwise, it will be Western goods; nothing else will be bought; if bought, it will be a traitor!</p>
<p>This is the determination of patriotic youths when buying clothing materials.</p>
<p>! Alas! The price of this cloth from Wan Zai is too expensive. At eighty-five cents per foot, wouldn't I buy spun silk? That one, rough and yellow, also costs thirty-five cents per foot, and it doesn't look very nice on.</p>
<p>This is the patriotic youth talking to himself in the cloth store.</p>
<p>! Sir, buy muslin; it is fine, clean, and white, looks nice, and the price is very reasonable, less than thirty cents per foot.</p>
<p>Isn't muslin a product of Japan?</p>
<p>! No, sir, the muslin in this store is a Western product. Look! Fine or not fine, clean or not clean?</p>
<p>! Indeed, cut me thirty-six feet; although I am cutting it, I still have some doubts as to whether it is Western goods!</p>
<p>! Sir, don't worry.</p>
<p>When the shop assistant said "don't worry," thirty-six feet of muslin had already been cut; after collecting the money and folding the muslin, the patriotic youth carried this package of muslin, walking and thinking:</p>
<p>! This muslin is Western goods, so is it that cheap?</p>
<p>After walking a little further, he comforted himself,</p>
<p>! If you want it to be beautiful and cheap, whether it's Western goods or not, you can only go with the flow.</p>

<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>丨From Baoshan Road to Fort Taiwan</p>
<p>The second day after the opening of the Songhu branch line was a Sunday, so I decided to go to Fort Taiwan.</p>
<p>The car started from Baoshan Road, and to the north was the ruined and scorched Baoshan Road. When the car passed each destroyed house, it was truly unbearable to look at! Imagine the raging fire, imagine the fellow villagers, young and old, escaping from the bullets, with death chasing after them, their homes burned in the fire. 1932 was truly not a peaceful year.</p>
<p>The car stopped at Tiantong Nunnery. Japanese troops were still stationed there, which was truly stimulating. All the way to Jiangwan, all the schools and factories were destroyed. From the car, you could see schools such as Labor University, Law School, and Patriotic School, all dilapidated and collapsed in this countryside of fluttering butterflies and blooming wildflowers. Most of the factories were beyond recovery!</p>
<p>After passing Gaojing Temple, we arrived at Zhanghuabang, beyond which was Wenzaobang. The car stopped there as the terminal, no longer going further.</p>
<p>From the station, you could see the rising sun flag flying over the Japanese-owned Huari Yarn Factory, where it was said that troops were still stationed.</p>
<p>Walking along the outer road of Wenzaobang, we arrived at Wusong Town, which had been completely destroyed, and passed the so-called "Shirakawa Bridge" and "Kanazawa Bridge" named by the Japanese. There were temporary shops set up on the road for business, probably by the merchants of Wusong Town. However, Wusong Town, which was gradually prospering, had also suffered this great calamity.</p>
<p>Maintaining order on the road were the so-called "Special Police" from Beiping. From a distance, seeing their white leggings, I thought they were foreign police.</p>
<p>In general, Wenzaobang and Wusong Town were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Walking from the end of Wusong Town, we arrived at Fort Taiwan. I then turned north along Zhonggong Road to see the China Public School, which I had heard was destroyed.</p>
<p>Except for the science building, which had just been completed, facing south and hit by a single shell, the rest was still intact and could be repaired. However, the clock tower, library, auditorium, old dormitories, and the three-story new dormitory on the east side, built by the school's former president Ma Junwu, were completely destroyed. Two faculty dormitories in the southeast corner were hit by a single shell, but the rest was fine. To restore the school to its original state, it would probably take at least four or five hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>After leaving China Public School, we went to the North and South Forts.</p>
<p>It was as lively as visiting historical sites and scenic spots. The road to the fort was too crowded. Women in their early summer attire, sitting in resilient, gasoline-burning motorcars, drove up the muddy paths to the fort, which was previously considered forbidden territory. Climbing up the fort, the vast expanse of gurgling river water, the twenty-four foreign warships and countless planes bombarding this defenseless old fort, how could the brave troops continue to defend it?</p>
<p>The muddied Yellow River, stained with blood, flowed endlessly, shedding silent tears, sighing silently towards the visiting people. It flowed away with such longing, looking at the dozens of destroyed steel cannons, large and small.</p>
<p>Before, behind, left, and right of the fort were huge craters caused by aircraft bombs. The cement-poured gun emplacements were also shattered. Scattered shells still lay on the edges of the destroyed steel cannons. The fort, stained with hot blood, and the gurgling river water, would probably not be easily washed clean.</p>

<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>Chinese people have always prided themselves on being seven feet tall. They often regard their eastern neighbors as short and ugly. Before September 18th, I observed the Japanese people I knew. I felt that only about 30% were short. The rest were similar to our Chinese people. It is said that since the Russo-Japanese War, the average height of their people has increased by about two inches. Now it has increased to four inches. When asked why, they said:</p>
<p>"It's due to dedicated exercise." The English are originally a Saxon race. Most of the people are short and fat. Therefore, they are called John Bull. However, through diligent exercise for more than a hundred years, they are now tall, healthy, and beautiful. Our country lags behind others in everything. Only in eating and foot-binding are we famous in the world. However, the race we produce is also becoming increasingly degenerate. There is even the insult of "Sick Man of East Asia." Reading about the survival of the fittest, and considering the future of the nation, I cannot help but feel emotional.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Marriage and Divorce <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>Now is an era of freedom. What young people generally like to say is "freedom" and "love." Therefore, the freedom of marriage has also greatly increased. However, as marriage has become freer, the number of divorces has also increased at the same time. What is the reason for this? Of course, there are many examples of divorce that are unavoidable and out of helplessness. However, based on my observation, there are special reasons for generally marrying freely and then divorcing.</p>
<p>First, being a lover is easy. Being able to cry, laugh, and dress up is enough. But being a wife is very difficult. Before marriage, the husband sees you as a capable, articulate, and educated woman. But after marriage, you are not good at serving your husband and in-laws, and you are lazy. This is naturally inappropriate. So the first reason for divorce is a lack of cultivation.</p>
<p>Second, young people's minds are fickle. Today they read romance novels, tomorrow they watch love movies. True.</p>

<p>— Narrated by Nie Zengjifen, written by her son Qijie</p>
<p>Indeed, carnal desires are all petty stirrings of selfishness, and are as incompatible with public morality as water and fire. Only by overcoming personal desires can any construction be hoped for. As Wang Yangming said, "It is easy to kill bandits in the mountains, but difficult to kill the bandits in the heart." Being able to overcome the enemy in one's heart is what it means to conquer oneself and strengthen oneself. In addition to the politicians mentioned above, great thinkers such as Rousseau, Tolstoy, and Marx, Kropotkin, were all able to reject material</p>
<p>enjoyment and live a life of frugality and simplicity. Rousseau and Tolstoy both abstained from meat. (Kropotkin also seemed to be a vegetarian.) And in modern times, the great scientist Edison, in his diet and daily life, was always in the laboratory. He had no interest in worldly pleasures. The two giants of the automobile industry, Ford and Sloan, neither smoked nor drank, nor did they like entertainment. The great scientist Einstein was simple and humble, with no desire for profit. A film company invited him to speak on screen for a fee of two hundred thousand US dollars. Einstein declined, saying that knowledge was not for money. Many other famous scientists have similar integrity. Their academic</p>
<p>achievements were never intended for carnal enjoyment. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is invention only after desire. On the contrary. Great inventors and thinkers who are driven by lust have never been heard of. Therefore, recent people say that developing desires promotes science and culture is purely speculation. It cannot be proven by facts. It is only used to justify their faults. Looking for counter-evidence, in Chinese and foreign history, any era that goes from stability to destruction is the result of the development of desires. The facts are clear and countless. Even the recent great war in Europe, the current precarious situation of countries holding each other in check, and the internal conflicts in our country for the past twenty years, are all manifestations of the development of desires. The degree of destruction is extremely tragic. The ingenious inventions produced are also nothing but for destruction and deceit. Have desires ever contributed to the evolution of the world?</p>
<p>It's fun to do the same thing. As a result, they often develop a feeling of boredom with their husband or wife. All they want to do is pursue the empty, illusory romance in novels. As a result, some unfortunate events occur. So the second reason for divorce is a lack of responsibility.</p>
<p>Third, the current social environment is really too bad. Young people's strange and outlandish attire, extravagant and licentious behavior, all have a bad influence. We often see, and even among so-called university students, they will write letters to women they barely know, saying things like "I admire your scholarship!" "Your letters are so well written!" "I hope we can be friends. Is that okay?" "Let's just be literary friends." These letters are sent out casually. It doesn't matter if they have a spouse or if the other person has a spouse. As a result, those with weak wills will inevitably give up on themselves. So the third reason for divorce is a bad environment.</p>
<p>If young people can pay attention to these three reasons and take precautions, it may be of some help to marital happiness.</p>

<p>— Suicheng</p>
<p>In the western suburbs of Luoyang, there is a military camp called West Palace, which was built by Yuan Shikai in his day. Later, General Wu Ziyu stationed troops there and rebuilt it. Guanghan Palace is one of them. Its structure is very ordinary, but its style is unique. At the entrance, there is a path like a team, from top to bottom, a total of thirty-three steps. At the end of the steps, there is another door. Entering again is the auditorium. Therefore, although the exterior is low, once inside, it feels surprisingly high. There are eight or nine caves around, deep and dark and unfathomable. Peeking into them, one feels a chilling coldness and dares not enter. It is said that there were no caves originally. They were dug in the seventeenth year of the Republic. At that time, the Northern Expeditionary Army advanced to Henan and was about to approach Luoyang at any moment. Airplanes came to drop bombs from time to time. General Wu was worried about this, so he opened up many caves to discuss matters with his colleagues and to avoid bombs. Since the National Crisis Conference used this as a meeting place, it was sealed with mud. Only three small holes were left at the door, with gas lamps lit inside, as a place for members to rest and drink tea. There are no other rooms inside, so it was used in this way.</p>
<p>Above the main door, there was originally the inscription "Guanghan," which was more than a foot in size, written by Kang Youwei. The brushwork was vigorous. Later, the</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters changed the place to the Central Auditorium and ordered the plasterers to chisel it off. Those who come later will no longer know that there was such a thing as Guanghan.</p>

<p>Chapter Nine: Attending a Special Train, a False Alarm; Sitting in a Cold Office, a Distant Dream</p>
<p>An Yutian wanted to move to the train window, open the curtains, and peek outside. However, this side did not face the platform. He had to open the carriage door and go out to see it from the train window on that side of the aisle. Unfortunately, the mechanism on this carriage door was in disrepair due to military use and had a problem. Just now, when Deputy Guo led him away, he had closed the door too forcefully, making it very tight. He could not pull it open quickly. Helpless, he slumped down again. The sound of military music and the commands of officers shouting "Salute!" rose into the air. It was obvious that Military Governor Ye had boarded the train. Then, in the aisle of this carriage, there was a series of sounds of leather boots stomping on the train floor. It seemed that many people had also run onto the train. Suddenly, the carriage door was pulled open violently from the outside, and four or five burly and imposing warriors from the guard team burst in. They carried hand-held automatic guns on their shoulders and countless small straight strips of bullet belts around their chests. Seeing An Yutian occupying a berth alone, they questioned him harshly, asking who he was. An Yutian hurriedly reported his official title of Counselor and explained that Deputy Guo had been ordered to entertain him. Among them was a burly man with a face full of menacing flesh and the most murderous aura. He still didn't believe it and spat in his face. Pointing his finger fiercely at his nose, he roared, "Don't talk nonsense. If you're a counselor, why aren't you wearing a badge? I know. You little bastard, you did a good job of working on Xiao Guo. He secretly brought you up here, but it's squeezing our berths." An Yutian realized that this warrior was scolding him for impersonating an official and sitting in the special train. He couldn't help but become furious. He wanted to clarify, but when he reached into his coat, a letter of appointment had already been given to Liang Xiaoyun. He couldn't produce any real evidence at this time. He wanted to wake up the Deputy Zhu above him to testify for him, but Deputy Zhu only cared about sleeping and refused to turn over. An Yutian was so anxious that his face turned red and his veins bulged. He walked angrily towards the outside, saying, "I just received the appointment today, so I didn't have time to get a badge. If you don't believe me, I'll leave. I still have my wife in the Fifth Madam's compartment. When I find Deputy Guo or Deputy Mao, I'm not afraid of not having a place to squat." At this time, the special train had started moving amidst the noise. An Yutian staggered a few steps. The warriors suddenly chased after him and dragged him back, saying, "You, why are you so inconsiderate? There are assigned positions on this train. Can you just barge in here without a badge? I advise you to find less trouble. Just squat here honestly for a while."</p>

<h3 id="e213">Urging the Retention of the 19th Route Army <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Since the news of the 19th Route Army being transferred to Fujian to suppress the Communists spread, letters and telegrams have been exchanged, or representatives have been sent to urge their retention. Originally, the 19th Route Army sacrificed themselves for the country, were loyal and brave in resisting the enemy, and should be sincerely retained to show respect. But my opinion is not so, for three reasons:</p>
<p>1.  The Japanese troops are about to withdraw completely. Now that there is no resistance, there is no need to station troops there. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>2.  The Communists are now very rampant and spreading widely. Regardless of their transfer or other reasons, suppressing the Communists is also a proper matter. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>3.  Although the Japanese troops are about to withdraw completely, the number of our troops stationed along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines is still quite large. With so many troops gathered, it is easy to cause misunderstandings and incidents.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Methods for Early Maturation of Vegetables and Fruits <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Vegetables and fruits are fresher and tastier when they are in season, and their selling price is higher, and buyers also welcome them. Therefore, gardeners and old farmers often try to improve their planting to produce mature vegetables and fruits in a short period of time, hoping to obtain thicker profits to cater to the psychology of buyers. Although they do not know scientific methods, when we look at them with a scientific eye, they sometimes fit scientific principles very well. Unfortunately, they lack a scientific foundation and deep theories to add to various researches to reach that mythical realm. Now I introduce a little method to them that they can get a kind of reference, and I think people who are interested in horticulture are very welcome.</p>
<p>Planting Method Using Electric Lights This method is to make vegetables and fruits and leaves and branches receive heat and light, and grow thick green leaves and lush fruits in a short period of time. His equipment is also very simple. He installs electric lights with stronger light in the greenhouse protecting vegetables and fruits, and it is better to hang a thermometer to test the temperature. A planter in Germany once discovered in his greenhouse protecting flowers that plants are heated and illuminated by electricity, and the flowers, fruits and branches and leaves can actually be large and good. We will definitely get good results if we try it according to the law.</p>
<p>Chemical Method This method was reported by Dr. Rob err Stewart, director of the Agricultural Science Department of Nafo University in the United States. He said that chemical methods can make immature fruits and vegetables mature early, and the aroma of fruits and vegetables does not change. He used canvas canopies to cover half of the fields, and then sprayed the vegetables in the canvas canopies with a chemical medicine made of alcohol and sulfuric acid called Ethylene. In less than a few days, the vegetables under the canvas have already grown vigorously and have matured, while the vegetables not covered by the canvas are still short and stunted and have not matured.</p>
<p>In another experiment, two unripe bananas were cut and hung on a shelf, one sprayed with Ethylene and one not. After forty-eight hours, the one sprayed with Ethylene had matured, and eating it had the same aroma as naturally matured, while the one not sprayed with chemicals was still green, hard and unripe. This method is also very easy to do. We only need to use alcohol and sulfuric acid to make Ethylene, and apply it to the vegetables as appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Talking About the Employer <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shibing</p>
<p>Next to the tiger stove is the place where Shanghai maids talk. When they meet their colleagues, they must talk a few words. The content of the conversation does not deviate from the three words (talking about the employer). Now I will record a few sentences of their conversation below.</p>
<p>A: "Sister, are you busy living in the × mansion? How much money do you earn a month?"</p>
<p>B: "Alas! Don't mention it. To others, it seems that our master is an official in the ×× government in Beiping, and there is only this × madam at home. Life must be very simple, and the madam must be very generous, so there must be some income. But I don't know that this madam has a very bad temper. She is very extravagant in making friends outside, but when it comes to treating the people in the mansion, she is very harsh! Only these five old ocean coins a month, and there is no extra income at all. Speaking of life, although the master is out, there is only one good person. You don't know that there are many good male and female friends, coming in and out every day, making my head hurt. These young masters and young ladies are all big shots, calling me alone, how can I serve them all? If there is something not taken care of, the madam will scold me. Recently, I have been interested in that foreign firm's little devil Xiao Wang. The two of them go dancing and watching movies every day, coming back in the middle of the night, and still asking for tea and water. Sister, do you think it's hard?"</p>
<p>A: "Oh! So that's how it is. Speaking of our place, the madam is still good, but there are only two young ladies. It's hard to say in a word. They dress up like demons every day, and they also dance and eat big meals. Their tempers are so bad, if something is wrong, they will scold people and beat people. Not to mention the little ones, who are beaten to a bloody mess. Even us maids are often scolded and get angry. Although they spend tens of dollars a day, they are not willing to spend a penny on us. They are very busy, with the eldest lady doing something and the second lady doing something, calling us non-stop. We eat well, but we don't even get the leftover rice. Alas! I don't want to work in such a family!"</p>
<p>C: "You two are still good. Like in our place, the employer is a young couple. The man works in a bank, and the young madam gambles at the ×× company every day. Recently, she has lost a lot. She tears down the house and pawns things at home. The young master finds out and investigates, but she says the maid stole it. I feel so wronged like this. It looks like I'm not happy to do it anymore!"</p>
<p>D: "Sisters, don't say anything. Eating this meal in Shanghai is the same everywhere. Which family is not snobbish? If you want to change employers, I don't think it will be as good, because these rich people are all domineering and think that they should treat servants like this. They don't know that the rich are also raised by mothers. Those who look for food are also raised by fathers and mothers. It's just that a few coins are wrong. Call your masters and madams, they are all people. It's really unforgivable to treat poor people like this. So I advise the two sisters, it's better to be familiar than to be unfamiliar. If you want to change, it's just changing the soup but not the medicine!"</p>
<p>Nonsense</p>

<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Today I talked to A about the way to deal with the world, and I asked him for advice.</p>
<p>"The method of dealing with the world is actually very simple, and it can be summed up in the three characters "wind, horse, and ox", but it is really not easy to do!" He said.</p>
<p>"Doesn't "wind, horse, and ox" mean not asking about anything? That is becoming a hermit instead of entering the world."</p>
<p>"This "wind, horse, and ox" is not that "wind, horse, and ox"," he replied with a smile, "This means showing off, flattering, and bragging."</p>
<p>"Hey! I'm not going to be a small dog in the political arena," I asked strangely.</p>
<p>"Ha! Whether you enter the political world, the business world, fall in love, or want to be a scholar or celebrity, whatever, you always need this wind, horse, and ox. If you use it skillfully, you can get a beautiful wife, concubine, and a tall building. Otherwise, you will suffer for a lifetime. Wind, horse, and ox are like the gods of fate, holding the power of life and death. Don't take it too lightly."</p>

<p>Student Work</p>
<h3 id="e219">My Fellow Student's Thesis <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>A few days ago, at home, I saw a note left by my friend Wang Jun, knowing that he had something important to meet with me about, saying that he wanted me to write a graduation thesis. At the time I thought, "This is strange, a graduation thesis, what does this have to do with me? I am not a college student, and I don't need to graduate. . . ." Soon after, I forgot about it because of something. But I agreed to meet with Wang Jun.</p>
<p>Of course, today is Sunday, I have time, and I have to wait for Wang Jun at home as promised. When he arrived, it was not long after noon, and I was lazily sleeping in bed, resting my fatigue.</p>
<p>Because I haven't seen him for a whole year, I inevitably felt distant from his life situation. However, from his brand new white gabardine pants and blue-and-white striped flannel, and the neatness of his neatly ironed jacket, I could guess that his life must be beautiful, even more pleasant than before.</p>
<p>Sure enough, from his conversation, I learned that he was already a college student, and now he was approaching graduation, so the graduation thesis was very important to him.</p>
<p>"We have been friends for many years," Wang Jun said awkwardly, "so I think you will definitely help me with this thesis, and it doesn't need to be very good, just a thesis is enough."</p>
<p>"But I don't know what you are studying? Is it politics or economics?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, I am studying Chinese studies."</p>
<p>"Oh? This is difficult. You know that I usually have no research on Chinese studies, and I have very few reference books myself, and the Oriental Library was burned by the Japanese, so how can this be successful?"</p>
<p>"No, I think you have written usually, as long as it hasn't been published, any kind will do."</p>
<p>"That won't work, sir! For example, you are studying Chinese studies, and if you take an economic thesis, can that also be done?" I smiled, repeatedly stating the reason why this cannot be mixed up, but he was still stubborn, still saying that as long as it is a thesis, and at the same time trying to cover up his difficulties in not being able to write, but I still couldn't obey, because this is too difficult. . . .</p>
<p>When I finally sent him out the door, I began to recall: "So a bachelor's thesis is like this!"</p>
<p>Of course, for his troubles, I also felt extremely sympathetic.</p>
<p>Complexion Problems</p>
<h3 id="e220">Female Assistant's Meal <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Last year, a certain organization needed someone proficient in small regular script, so they posted a small advertisement seeking applicants. They received a total of three hundred applications, overwhelming the organization, which didn't know how to choose. A shop that collected the letters even had applicants coming to their door, willing to spend several foreign dollars for the shop's staff to have a feast. Hearing this, I knew how difficult it was for men to find work and how many were unemployed. I boldly assumed that women's employment would not be so dire.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that a certain organization was recruiting a female assistant, and the result was the opposite of what I had imagined. The organization, imitating the regulations of the Young Women's Christian Association, planned to have a woman handle mail, which was essentially a disguised "messenger" position. It was said that the monthly salary was only ten dollars, and the applicants included middle school dropouts, kindergarten nannies, primary school teachers, hospital nurses, women in cheongsams and leather shoes, with powdered faces and short hair, mostly young women. The organization was astonished, feeling it unbearable to have them do this work, and without any better positions to place them. They never imagined that such a recruitment would result in such a tragic spectacle of female unemployment!</p>
<p>They even said repeatedly: "We don't care about the salary; we can endure hardship." Some even asked for an immediate resolution.</p>
<p>In the past, people said, "Wearing silk, eating oil in the belly." But are they not wearing silk? Now, it's clear that it's not necessarily the case; it's just putting on a brave face. The one finally chosen, it was said, had a family who used to run a shop in Zhabei. After the Shanghai Incident, the whole family was ruined, and she lost her job... But people continued to arrive despite the rain, and even after hearing that someone had been "selected," they still stubbornly said, "I'm just asking for a friend." How heartbreaking and shameless this is! I don't know if it's a gift from the violent sun, or if society has reached this point? Thinking about this, I'm also shocked by how many dancers, singers, and prostitutes there are.</p>
<p>Street Tail</p>
<h3 id="e221">Loyal and Upright, Bearing the Name of Zai Changwu <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Walking past Zhengjia Wood Bridge, I saw many people standing in front of a hotel entrance, looking at the wall. Unconsciously, I squeezed in to join the crowd. The first thing I saw was a neatly written sign that read "Dr. of Literature ×× is a guest." Next to it, arranged on both sides, were several small photos. Who were the people in the photos? They were all important figures in the party and the nation. But there was also an exception: a photo of the "Manchurian Chief Executive," who had been kidnapped by the Japanese and made the protagonist of a puppet show in Manchukuo.</p>
<p>"This is another advertisement from a boring street performer," I thought, understandingly. At the same time, I wanted to leave, because such tricks were commonplace in Shanghai, nothing more than selling "wild man's head" to earn a living, praising and extolling successful figures, and making imperfect criticisms and accusations of past celebrities. But it was the first time I had encountered a street performer with a doctorate in literature. In order to glimpse the doctor's knowledge, I lingered to watch. Under each photo was a sentence that was neither poetry nor commentary. The last photo was of a young man in military uniform, labeled with the five characters "True Portrait of Zhang Xueliang." I thought, this</p>
<p>is a leader who became famous for allowing two provinces to be ceded without resistance in a short period, a fortune teller who is best at catering to trends. I wonder what kind of criticism he has? Looking closely, it was also four lines of poetry:</p>
<p>Round face, thick eyebrows, wide cheeks and chin,</p>
<p>High ears, fleshy, even black eyes,</p>
<p>Body like a unicorn, strong and majestic,</p>
<p>Loyal and upright, bearing a unique name.</p>
<p>The words "round face, fine eyebrows" didn't seem to describe the true appearance of the young master Zhang. I repeated the phrase "Loyal and upright, bearing a unique name," and couldn't help but laugh. What a flattering Dr. of Literature! It's a pity he lives in Shanghai. If he were around Zhang Xueliang, he would definitely be appreciated and perhaps recommended for an official position!</p>
<p>Leading hundreds of thousands of troops, he did not resist foreign insults, but indulged in pleasure and extravagance. Nothing could be worse. And this so-called Dr. of Literature uses him as a front and even praises him with the beautiful name of "loyal and upright." I don't know what to say?</p>
<p>What a loyal and upright Zhang Xueliang, now he has found a confidant, truly worthy of everlasting fame!</p>

<p>Civil Instructions: Chen Boqi's request to collect the money. You are instructed to come to the court at 10:00 AM on the 13th of this month to collect the money. ▲ Lu Gaoyong's request for execution. You are instructed to wait for the case to be heard and investigated. ▲ Qian Fucheng's request for provisional execution by providing security.

Because the case is not finalized, the request for execution should be postponed. ▲ Zhenda Customs Broker's request for filing of the charge of using Hu Zhongji's Bai Youguang paper five pieces to offset the porterage fee. Because there are obvious disputes in the claims of the applicant, the request for filing cannot be approved. ▲ Vladimir Barbaek's request for limiting the plaintiff's return of the disputed case. Because the civil execution case has statutory reasons, the execution cannot be stopped because of the payment of the security deposit. The money paid by the applicant at the time of seizure has already been issued by this court to the creditor for collection and completion of the case. Therefore, the request to limit the creditor's return and storage of the case is without legal basis and cannot be approved. ▲ Wang Zhixian's request to be exempted from paying another security deposit and to be released quickly. The request is disapproved. You are still instructed to change the search for a proper security to be reviewed and approved. ▲ Xu Yutian's request for the issuance of arrest warrants and collection of evidence. The case has already been approved by this court to stop execution because the defendant filed a third-instance appeal, and the entire file has been sent to the High Third Sub-Court for processing. The various sections requested should be postponed. ▲ Xinkang Company's request to unseal the property. The request is approved. You are instructed to order the clerk to unseal the property. ▲ Qianyi Silver Company's request for forcible sale and execution. You are instructed to wait for the case to be heard and investigated. (June 8)</p>
