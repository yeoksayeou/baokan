<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯之鐘</h3>
<p>牛何之。將以釁鐘。牛之命運定矣亦。安望他人之不忍見其殼觫而易之哉。人見此龐然大物。不尙智。不角力。而惟一味乞憐也。曰死固其分也。復何怨。彼爲保持廟堂之尊嚴者。祇希望此鐘能發宏大而悠遠之聲。固無惜乎一牛。今庖丁已操刀而前矣。止欠一割耳。割亦爲期不遠。但所釁之鐘。將來能否錚鋐鏜鈶。有以發揮其聲威與尊嚴。恐彼高踞廟堂之上者。亦未有若何成算也。一年來國人眼之所視。耳之所聽。常集中於國聯及國聯調查團之報告。以爲太上政府之國聯必能主持公道。而公道所在。必能約束日本。於是國聯云亦云步亦步。趨亦趨俯首貼耳。馴伏不敢一動。然而前途無幸。固不必至今而始可斷定也。國聯態度之柔弱無能。久已表暴無餘矣。爲保持其廟堂之尊嚴。希冀其威聲之不隳。一再徇日本之要求。今又以徇日本要求。延期討論調查團報告書聞矣。國聯所以允許報告書延期討論者。非對於遠東事件謀有以解决之也。實以無法解决。不得不求一下台之策耳。蓋國聯明知日本之强横。非國聯所能約束。國聯旣不能約束日本。乃轉而與日本周旋。然而一味周旋。又恐顯露其爲强國操縱之眞面目。故希望中日事件之能速了。惟速了之方策。旣不能一蹴而幾。延宕又非得計。故其最後方。策希望卸其仔肩於中日雙方。慫恿其直接交涉。中日如能直接交涉。則中國領土如何被宰割。主權如何被侵佔。人民如何被蹂躪。均可不問。而在表面上遠東事件固已妥恊矣。國聯亦可慶幸其責任之完畢矣。此非我人揣測之詞也。據最近報紙消息。國聯調查團報告書結論。仍迂廻。曲折重歸於直接交涉之一途。由國聯指令中日直接交涉。原則爲（一）满洲僅存名義上中國之主權。（二）與满洲以廣大之自治權。在上述兩條件下。由中日舉行直接交涉。苟斯種消息。臾屬確實。是固無付庖丁以解牛之全權也。夫牛固被犧牲。矣而國聯所釁成之鐘。將收如何效果乎。</p>
<p>國聯會章。國聯所持以號召世界和平保持威信之鐘也。今以此方法解决中日問題。能無損於國聯會章之尊嚴否。竊恐國聯之鐘。非特不足以鳴和平而全威信。且將由此一釁而隳毁耳。</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社二十九日日内瓦電今晨十一時正在國聯大會人衆擁擠中、法總理赫禮歐登壇演說大要如、下『國聯大會一般問題之討論、乃以考量各國之公意、法國在此項討論未終了之前、深願在演壇上抒展其思想、並宣佈其對於國聯之信心、現任行政院主席凡列勒曾提出以下之問題、謂國聯現已罹重病乎、抑僅一時之危機、大會主席波里蒂斯鑒於世局之危險、亦嘗諄囑吾人、加倍努力於和平之工作、過去一年來、國聯本身、曾作多方面之活動、裁軍大會頼以産出、洛桑會議頼以成功、依常理而言、國聯大會、當力處審愼、不宜冒眜發言、以破壞大會中鎭靜之空氣、在此次大會、吾人雖爲各種問題之所厄、然吾人固不當以乖誤之舉措、妨害問題之解决、吾人編訂國内法典以規定個人之生活、尙須慘淡經營而後成、欲求國際平和法典之告成更非易事、亦甚明矣、法國深願奮勇工作、以謀裁軍大曾之成功、並以圖一般之利益、吾人當務之急、在接近目前之事象、淸算過去之總帳、並改造數世紀以來之舊制度、法國所奉行之外交原則無他、公約而已、舍公約之外、更無他求、蓋國聯公約之於吾人、猶法律也、』赫禮歐述至此、表示美國偉大民主主義之未能列席、實深爲遺憾、但對於彼邦具有崇高理想之人物、（按即指胡佛與史汀生）對於非戰公約之盡力擁護、則再三加以贊揚赫禮歐於是復將過去一年間重大國際事變、略加評述、而特别重視洛桑條約與國聯之精神契合、法總理次述斯德萊柴經濟會議之满意結果、謂在此會議中、德英意法與東歐農業國顯示誠意聯結之徵、騐斯德萊柴不過爲開闢新途徑之初步而已、法國今後將不恤犧牲以求此種計畫之實現、赫禮歐又謂、洛桑會議雖不過一種準備工作、然已爲不久舉行之世界經濟貨幣會議、開其先河、總之過去一年中吾人之所獲、已寡不爲矣當前之事變、已顯示國聯存在之必要、國聯有二大害敵焉、即復古精神與暴民精神是、今國聯所需要者、避免此二敵之殘害、以進行工作即已足矣、『國</p>
<p>聯之能力、誠不足以消滅暴力、然用法律手段、以緩和爭端、則爲國聯分内之事、謀儘量採用此種手段、而不存偏私、此種願望之殷切、當未有如法國者、法國代表團之不贊成一切對於日内瓦之悲觀論調者、以此故也、』語次、彼復追念故白里安氏、并稱道其辯才、赫禮歐之結語、希望得各國代表之信任、謂『吾人幸勿中途抛擲其槳、惟吾人意志脆弱之日吾人方遇莫大之危險也、』</p>
<p>國民社廿九日日内瓦電法總理赫禮歐、今日上午在國聯大會之演說、外間盼望已久、乃赫氏登壇後、僅宣讀一篇洋洋大文、顯似法代表團預先擬成、赫氏僅照讀一過、旣未表演手勢、而兩目亦未嘗一離稿紙、最後撮述法國所抱國聯政策之原則、（一）廢止秘密外交、（二）漸廢聯盟舊制、代以各國根據平安基礎之合作新制、（三）謀國際公斷與國際公法有進步的發展、結語則稱、法國並不消極請各國亦勿失望云云、赫氏演說、僅得不熱烈之采聲因其内容空泛、國聯中人認爲無補於解决、目前緊要問題也、</p>
<h3>英代表薛西爾之演說</h3>
<p>國民社二十九日日内瓦電英代表薛西爾今日在國聯大會演說、雄辨滔滔、力爲國聯辯護、痛責各會員國但顧私國、致國聯不能順利解决國際大問題、對於满案尤有震聾發聵之讜論、薛氏素以熱忱擁護國聯著聞、此次抨擊法德兩國不稍假借、率直宣稱、倘此兩國能得同意則世界之隉阢不寗、頓可消除百分之七十五、薛氏力請各國對於最重要之軍備問題、一顯决心放棄自私觀念與游移態度、聲稱『吾輩究將軍縮乎此問題必須答以「然」或「否」否則模稜敷衍、必致重演歐戰前遠劣於今日之情狀』、嗣乃痛論满洲時局及中日爭執、理正詞嚴、坦直宣稱、『倘國聯盟約能施行於遠、東則國聯不致處於今日之困難地位』、因反詰『國聯曷爲不在遠東施行制裁』、並謂『此中理由、余不欲代答、但以爲此方或彼方或竟雙方定有破壞盟約之罪』、薛氏不僅雄辯驚四座、而且語發由衷、因此全塲深爲動容、尤以對於满案之痛快語及痛陳法德同意與軍縮之必要、令人發生深刻印象、</p>
<h3>國聯前途與中日問題</h3>
<p>國民社二十九日日内瓦電據此間公正不阿之觀察時事者意見、國聯前途將視其今後大會能否爲中日問題覓得適宜解决以卜之、今日會場中、固無有作國聯能强迫將满洲交還中國之想者、但擁護國聯之人、皆希望能覓得一解决方法、或採用一種政策、將來卒能促遠東現局之崩潰、而使满洲復合於中國此間一段不認李頓調查報告、必遵照國聯盟約與九國公約規定、視满洲爲中國完整領土之一部份、作爲報告根據、所以極爲日本所不满、並公然宣稱、政府拒絶接受承認中國在满主權之任何解决辦法、以此咸信日本將在此案覓得解决以前、退出國聯、據觀察時事者意見、國聯此時祇有兩途、第一途完全屈服承認满洲已非中國所有、第二途則重申不承認違犯國際條約所得領土之政策、繼以制定切實方案、施强大壓力於日本實行此政策、倘國聯循第一途徑、則勢將切實承認其對於國際事件、已成無用機關、薛西爾久懷此意在胸、故今日發此痛切演說、以激勵會衆也、設國聯果若此、則一切國際會議、皆爲之動搖、軍縮會議當準備迅告失敗、經濟始蘇必將爲之遲延、而下次大戰之基礎、業已爲之準備、惟國聯之出此途徑、固無人敢信、但能否獲得一種方式、將使日本交還满洲於中國則極可懷疑也、</p>

<h3>德外長提早歸國</h3>
<p>國民社二十八日日内瓦電德國外長牛頼資、頃已决定提早歸國、因自法國總理赫禮歐在格拉馬發表其演說詞後、德國所要求之軍備均等之前途、頓見黯澹也、德國在日内瓦外交人物、本期能藉英國斡旋之力、成立一種折衷方式、但法國總理持論旣如此、頗使德國感覺、法國今日之對德國、一如昔日普恩賚當政時也</p>
<p>現德國方面已决定將參加軍縮會議問題、暫時擱置不論、惟倘能以尋常外交手段、繼續討論軍備問題、德國並無拒絶之意、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十八日柏林電德國外長牛拉脫、業於午後五時、由日内瓦返國、牛氏不待赫禮歐總理明日演說、即離日内瓦、係出於巴本總理之命、非正式方面謂、牛氏此行、乃胸有成竹、故意出此、使近日外交上之嚴重形勢、盡量暴露云、牛氏返柏林後、是否將晋謁興登堡總統、尙未可必、但與巴本及舒萊休將軍會晤、則無可疑、蓋德國對全部軍備問題之態度、實爲舒氏勢力所左右也、内閣將於星期五日、舉行閣議、研究現狀、以便採取重要决議、柏林人之心理如何、則於禾爾夫通信社發表巴本答復赫禮歐談話之語氣、可以見之、一般之意、以爲德國軍備平等之要求、業已失敗、而失敗之責、全在法國電、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十八日柏林電德國外長牛拉脫、不待赫禮歐之演說即返柏林、此舉在德國政界中、發生深刻印象、當法國答復德政府牒文之翌日、柏林方面宣稱、牛拉脫外長抵日内瓦後、定能與法國作相當聯絡云云、今則論調一變而謂德所希冀者、早已明示、無待再贅法德聯絡、當由法國代表倡導、然而法國並未倡導、故雙方之未能聯絡、過在法國云云、有人以爲舒萊休將軍、迭次宣言、不能牽涉政府、當由舒氏個人負責、而全體報紙、則皆以爲舒氏宣言、足以表示政府意向、至國家主義派報紙、則斥責巴本以爲總理曾擔保德國無恢復軍備之意、措詞未免過於斬截、而無挽回餘地、又稱、日内瓦方面所擬草案、欲使裁軍與安全、有聯帶關係、此種計畫、無異「詐欺企圖」云云、觀於上述論調、可見任何國際監督之議、德國定將激烈反對也、</p>

<h3>特載</h3>
<p>改革中國學校敎育芻議</p>
<p>（四）　程天放</p>
<p>現在讓我來說明這個系統表、第一我們先講初級敎育、這一個階段的學校、統名曰小學、年限應該是六年、但是爲顧全中國經濟情形和急於普及起見、有些小學不妨四年就畢業小學裏面祇包括兩種敎育一種是國民敎育、一種是生産敎育、在國民敎育方面、應該儘量地利有這四年或六年的光陰使得兒童具備近代國民必備的常識、三民主義是中國建國的網領、兒童必須十分明瞭國文的程度要做到能夠看普通的書報、寫淺近的信扎和文字、本國的歷史地理、世界的歷史地理、都應該知道梗槪、中華民族過去偉大的事蹟、更應該深刻地印入兒童的腦筋、才能夠引起他們愛國家愛民族的觀念、對於敎學衛生和自然科學、都應該有初步的智識、並且能夠應用、一方面使得兒童了解國家民族的危險、和個人對於國家社會所負的責任、一方面就要訓練兒童團體生活的能力、能夠做到這幾層、小學畢業出來的學生、才可以做一個健全的國民而無愧、小學敎育也才配稱做國民敎育、</p>
<p>國民敎育的標凖、應該由中央規定頒布全國、不論這個小學設在吉林或是設在廣州、設在山東、或是設在靑海、也不管這個小學是省立縣立或是私立敎授的取材或有不同、標凖必須一律、受了四年小學敎育的、一定要到如何程度、受了六年小學敎育的一定要到如何程度、不能做到這程度的學校、政府就應該督促改良、或予以取締、生産敎育就不然了、生産敎育應該因人因地而不同、設在農村的小學、學生是農夫的子弟、他們的環境是農業的環境、就應該授學生以農業生産的智識和技能、設在都市的小學、學生是商人和工人的子弟、他的環境是工商業的環境、就應該授學生以工商業生産的智識和技能、照此例推、則海濱或江邊的小學、可敎學生如何捕水産、出紙地方的小學、可以敎學生如何造紙、出磁器地方的小學、可以敎學生如何燒磁器、總而言之、各適當時的環境、不致成爲空談、這種敎育是現在小學内所最没有做到的、現在的小學常常使得農人的子弟不能耕田、工人的子弟不能做工、將來的小學、應該使農人子弟受了小學敎育種田種得更好、工人子弟受了小學敎育、做工做得更精、這才是眞正生産敎育</p>
<p>或者有人要講、小學兒童年齡很幼、能夠敎他們多少生産技能呢、我說要敎小學生以專門生産技能、當然不行、但是要使他們出校後在社會上做一個生産份子、却一定可以中國有許多兒童、不識一個字、没有進過一天學校、却已經在那裏做生産事業了、例如農村裡八九歲的兒童、常常帮助他們父兄做耘禾拔草斫柴的工作、我們那裡農家牧牛的事差不多完全交給兒童去管、城市裡十歲左右兒童在工廠内做工的、也是隨處可見、這種兒童踓是或者帮助家庭做事、不得報酬或是得微薄的工資、但是我們决不能否認他是生産份子、所以鄉村的小學如果敎這些小學生以農業的知識、如種子應該如何選擇、水旱應該如何防患、牲畜應該如何喂養、不僅是書本上的傳授、並且是實地的練習、那末四年或六年畢業以後、他們生産能力豈不增加了嗎、城市裏小學如果敎小學生以工業或商業上的智識、如機器如何管理、如何使用、賬目如何登記、顧客如何招待、也不僅是書本上的傳授、并且是實地的練習、那末這班小學生四年或六年畢業以後、到工廠去豈不是一便更好的工人、（諸者注意我並不贊成童工、但是在中國現在經濟狀况之下、設法完全禁止童工、只有由政府來限制作工的時間、和予以特别保護、）到商店去豈不是一個更好的學徒嗎、我并且主張小學兒童不論他們家庭的貧富、畢業後是否就要謀生、都應該敎他們以生産的技能、因爲畢業後就要謀生的固然立刻受益、就是家庭富裕可以升入中學大學的、經過一番生産訓練、也可以知道稼　的艱難、和勞動的可貴、於改革社會有許多影響哩、</p>

<h3>所謂進貢的一幕喜劇</h3>
<p>— 景紀</p>
<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<p>相老人在最近國難紀念節後，曾這樣說了一席話：！「現在眞是異口同聲，說國難，說國恥；我不人云亦云，且說說我親聞見的喜劇，外藩以前如何來進貢吧！所謂「進貢」，中國所得無幾；倒還賠本的呢！那享盛名的書法家，何紹基做過派到高麗的欽使曾寫了一本很工整仿顔體的字帖呢？這事件在我是很熟悉的。</p>
<p>從前駐藏大臣，多是满人；一直到淸末；綫有漢大臣。據說那地方六月裏下雪和下雨一般，羊皮非常的好：要拿來進貢的。</p>
<p>最有趣的，就是來進貢的人，沿路都要打把勢，藉此來歛錢，充那路費用！有一次，聽說暹邏來貢象，沿途走到有大河的地方，進貢的人就要求那本地官府人民，聚十萬八萬錢趕做一座橋，硬說象不能過河，擔擱進貢天朝的要公；本地方受不了這樣大的罪名：如是就送那進貢的人一批錢，橋也不必造了；他牽着象泅水過河；其實，在印度熱帶等處，象泅水過河，算什麽一回事，早已習慣了的！每次進貢的人都受了非常豐富的贈品回去。</p>
<p>我國以前，對待屬國；原是這般優待的！旣不要彼此常來往；還禁止屬國彼此來往：攔入攔出，都有禁令！彼此能維持和平相安的局面就夠了！</p>
<p>那會像那笑面虎慫恿了高麗獨立，自己就來呑併呢？」</p>
<h3>各個的三個不同時代</h3>
<p>— 奚鳥</p>
<p>丨悲哀的前奏丨</p>
<p>時代踏着前進的輪子，一步一步似在發展它驕傲的歷史。秋聲起了。我靜靜地翻開各個没落在這時代裏的影子，禁不起陣陣秋風的襲擊，把我弱小的心靈，就這樣死心塌地的幻滅了。</p>
<p>幻滅的結果，使我更其忘懷不了從過去、現在、展望到將來之各個的三個不同時代的黑影，感覺得一種苦悶的恐怖！</p>
<p>我們的國家</p>
<p>（過去）我們都聽到革命救國的聲浪。</p>
<p>（現在）不抵抗下斷送了東三省。</p>
<p>（將來）據某要人說：「中國如亡在國民政府手裏，眞是痛心之事」呵！我們要亡國了嗎？·········</p>
<p>我們的敎育</p>
<p>（過去）學生的聰明，不如敎員的期望時，敎員得罰學生被打手心和立壁角之類。</p>
<p>（現在）敎員的辦事，不如學生的心意時，學生得請敎員吃生活和滾出去之類。</p>
<p>（將來）敎員們都改營别業，不敢幹黑板生涯，學生們趾高氣揚，也許自己從中推校長敎員之類··········</p>
<p>我們的靑年</p>
<p>（過去）受庭訓，讀死書，克紹箕裘是最好的典型。</p>
<p>（現在）反對頑固家庭，擁護自由戀愛，跳舞洋裝是最漂亮的生活。</p>
<p>（將來）打倒父母老朽，實行家庭革命，有錢的儘把洋化娛樂承受靑春的快樂，無錢的研究欺詐拐騙，不務正業··········</p>
<p>噙着眼淚寫了這些，再也寫不下了！</p>
<h3>洋殮</h3>
<p>— 耘喰</p>
<p>丨萬國殯儀館的一幕丨</p>
<p>生活科學化的上海，没有一件事不在科學支配之下；内地葬一口棺柩，要佔據幾分地的大小，如果　次　比的掩埋着，旁人便視爲義塜了：家擁巨萬的富豪，一墳所佔之地，嘗多到十畝之廣！幾千年後土地的影響，統計起來着實驚人！都市就不然，有公墓，佔地僅一穴，是何等的經濟？講到殯殮有萬國殯儀館，在下寄食上海，歷時十年，怎麽樣一所萬國殯儀館？慚愧没有瞻仰過，月初友人某氏病肺死於滬，便在萬國殯儀入殮的，該館有禮堂，可以祭奠，有屍車，運死人到館，據說某國領事，候家屬含殓，經過一個月，屍容如生；洗滌屍體等手術，都是館中人辦理，親如骨肉，不得顧問的，弔的人，制止高聲談話，家屬也不得啼哭！外人的殯儀，注意在一個「靜」字，正合上我們大中華的一句「呑聲飲泣」了；殮衣穿好了，安置在一架床上，由家人戚友作最後的一面，不論男女老幼，都加以化裝，陳屍在床，和生人的睡眠一般；有幾位少婦，還塗着粉和胭脂，假使把伊們安放在一個精緻的臥室裏，是一幅很好的美人假寐圖；棺柩的式樣、和中國笨大的也不同，形如一隻長箱子，屍體經了科學的手術，也用不到石灰這一類的東西，子女多的，大可以扛到柩車上去，並不見得吃力，正和常人體重加一隻箱子的斤量罷了，那麽雖萬里奔喪，可以從容親視含殮咧。</p>
<h3>羞恥可以打倒嗎？</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>丨結果是增加罪惡丨</p>
<p>「打倒羞恥」這句口號，也是這二十世紀中的新産生，摩登的靑年男女，時常會在唇邊口角流露着，表示他們「或她們」都是站在時髦的最前綫的立塲上。</p>
<p>時代的輪子不住在向前推進，除舊趨新，固然是不易的程序，可是在這舊道德已經推倒，新道德尙未産生的我國，我雖不是道學家，但敢提出來請問，這「打倒羞恥」是否適用於最近的我國？</p>
<p>方今的社會中，已經層出不窮的無恥勾當不絶的排演着，尤其是這繁華的上海，什麽人獸相交，兄妹串戲，（特别戲）和其他竊，盜，綁票等等的罪惡，他們的心目中，本來要滅了這個「恥」字，今旣有人來提倡「打倒羞恥，」正使他們十二分的贊同，從此以後，天大無恥的事，儘可去幹了末了！我記憶起一副滑稽諷刺的妙聯，是彭剛直贈給某富户的，聯中含有（忘八無恥）四字，原來某富户，是以卑鄙齷齼手段致富的，聯云；「一二三四五六七，忠孝節義禮義廉。」你看咒得何等痛快啊！</p>
<p>文壇小消息　名小說家　　徐哲身氏。少與开虚我生齊名。在滬　文三十年。出版之文藝曁小說書籍。不下一百數十種。近因創設之小說函授社。本外埠入社學生。已逹五六百人之多。原有社址。不敷應用。業於本月一日。遷入法租界西愛咸斯路愼成里五○號洋房云。</p>
<h3>湖畔萍蹝</h3>
<p>— 汪放庵</p>
<p>丨正是河山殘破日，偷聞猶復事淸遊·丨</p>
<p>是八年前的湖天秋色，彷彿記得起我和夢魚在風雨歸途，那時，我們在小划子中；眞的，「山自惺忪水亦柔！」這般的景色，任是詩人畫家，也贊詠不絶，描寫不盡，然而；雨絲風片，兀自向我們身上打來，小小的西子湖，經不起風狂雨暴，幾乎激起了驚濤駭浪，我們的閑情逸致，便消滅得無影無踪，這是我和夢魚第一次由神交而識面的時候，我們却已有了同舟共濟的觀念，事情雖平凡空泛而且簡單，但所給予我們的印象，確很深刻，任是健忘，竟一些兒没有模糊。</p>
<p>年來；朋舊蕭疎，大都好似萍一般地東調西泊，無所歸宿，夢魚！我和他連信也嬾得通，足足竟有四五年之久，等似有家歸不得的我，最近，就流浪到了西子湖濱把已經摒棄的筆硯，重復整理起來，迫着做不願做的工作。</p>
<p>「九一八」的喪鐘，正打在我的心坎上，帶着血淚的紀念文字，舖满了我的桌上，我的工作，雖似十分緊張，我的神經，却幾乎錯亂到了極點，這一天的深夜，夢魚和娟紅夫人以及琪兒，從帝國主義鐵蹄下的上海，到了西子湖邊，於是；我們又萍一般地聚合在一起了！　在第二天的早晨，我帶着　方以及兒子鐵如，趕到西湖飯店的三樓，和夢魚他們會晤。夢魚！他是一個富於血性的朋友，這兒，他却竟在這國難期間，帶着夫人女兒，來杭州看潮，他的血已冰冷了嗎？怎麽？我當他開口要我做一回嚮等，前經江干看潮這幾句話說出之後，實在非常奇詫。</p>
<p>然而；夢魚的話，實在又使我啼笑皆非，他說：</p>
<p>「朋友！你奇怪嗎？我却有我的理由，理由是··當這國難周年紀念，我眞看不慣充满着洋大人氣味的上海，亟想找一塊乾凈土，舒散我一些積疊下來的煩悶，換一口空氣呼吸！於是，想到這西湖，想到這乾凈的西湖，想到雄奇的潮頭，想到伍員那麽的忠君愛國，想到錢武肅王那麽的三千鐵弩射潮頭的壯舉，想到大破胡虜，不及痛飲黃龍，終於寃死的岳飛，想到丨於是；我就有了這麽一個動機；並且，順便還來印證一下八年前我們湖天秋泛的舊夢。」</p>
<p>就在這個時候，我們開始了我們的遊程。</p>
<p>第一天：我們到過虎跑，飲過那淸冽異常的泉水，登過六和塔望過這没有外國兵艦的錢塘江，終於在江干觀海樓上，欣賞了一下「潮尾巴！」</p>
<p>第二天，我們在激澎的波光中，蕩着一葉扁舟，到過曾經做個擁有十七妙年華姑娘的甜夢的ⅩⅩ山莊，巡視一般到過已經易主的端友别墅，嘗過樓外的西湖醋魚，終於到白雲庵月下老人座前，求過幾張籤句，匆匆地送夢魚和娟紅夫人以及琪兒，上了回上海的火車，萍一般又分了開來。</p>
<p>這雖僅僅只有短短的二個整天，何况，又値河山殘破之日，然而；我的煩襟，却被湖光山色，洗滌得乾乾凈凈。</p>
<p>八年前的湖天秋色，還是和今朝一模一樣，只有我和夢魚，已是哀樂中年，額上多了幾條皺紋，我們這次别後，轟的一聲，那魯戰却突然爆發，衝破了國難時間沉寂的局面。</p>

<p>寗帮試辦湘元</p>
<p>昨日洋米沉寂統市只由本街應酬三百包價奥昨日相似、但以本客去化均呆形勢不佳貨主方面仍有堅持之意、因此市面日見呆滯昨開小絞八元四角至三角半、西貢一號九元半、週日附近客秈逐有到埠、南京六合與皖省江北各區逐有來申河下新到各路新尖數目亦多、故日前到申之湖南主乃無人過問後路更難合划昨日開湖南元米四十包、價十二元四角由寗波帮辦去云</p>
<h3>始穩繼軟的粉麥市</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨粉市上下午開盤後各月份市面呈初穩繼跌之象以洋麥報價、雖爲一角左右、惟業内外之人心、因廠家續定洋麥、此後之抛數、勢不可免、且際此米價步鬆之時、粉市當難擯住因此人心初平繼因廠家徵有出檔、市面步見不振較前日收價又落一分左右迨至下午開盤、傳廠家又續定三號麥一船價三兩七錢半市氣仍寂、而本月份因客帮不動聞華豐將有棧單交出、致最後三盤、市勢大鬆直　二分外結果本月份較前日跌二分七厘半、十月份跌一分二厘半、十一月份跌一分七厘半、十二月份及一月份跌一分半二月份跌二分云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日期麥上下午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼跌之象、上午各盤、因洋麥報價、微好一角左右、人心尙定、至下午開盤、因粉市不佳、且因洋麥續有定成、此後之本麥實無輕重可言、因此人心見寂惟交易亦淸淡異常、結果十月份較前日跌二分、十一月份跌二分、十二月份跌四分、一月份跌三分、二月份跌四分現麥市面、已見平靜全日交易、未見暢盛祇開鎭江麥三百四十包價三兩三錢七分云、</p>

<p>丨後批不日可到丨</p>
<p>龍口粉近日乏到、前市曾到十九兩、但現在貨底不多、而福建帮去胃尙佳請過二百數十包、故售價轉升十九兩三錢至二錢、烟台粉貨亦寥寥售十七兩江北粉十一兩半、據聞龍口粉後批有五六百包、大約四五日内卽可以申云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲廠長吐供不敷求</h3>

<h3>林主席昨抵滬</h3>
<p>謂來滬就醫並無任務</p>
<p>今日將與孫科氏晤談</p>
<p>國府主席林森、昨晨八時、由京乘夜車抵滬同車來滬者、有實業部長陳公博·鐵道部次長曾仲鳴·銓叙部長鈕永建·及意大利公使齊亞諾等、據林氏表示、來滬仍係就醫、並無特殊任務、聞林氏今日將訪晤孫科、交換政治意見、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>儉約可風　前晚林主席登車時、未帶隨從、亦未通知路局掛車、僅臨時購一頭等臥車票、故京站並無歡送人員、同時鐵道部次長曾仲鳴·意大利公使齊亞諾·則同乘特掛之花車、曾氏於今晨下車後、始知林主席亦來滬、亦可知林之儉約矣、昨晨八時車抵北站、市公安局長文鴻恩·親率警士及軍樂隊到站歡迎、林主席昨仍衣藍布長衫、披黑大氅、於軍樂抑掦聲中、緩步下車、旋即偕到站歡迎之郵政司長林實、同乘汽車、赴金神父路寓邸休息、</p>
<p>林氏談話　林主席抵寓後、旋接見各報社記者、據林氏談稱、本人此次來滬、並無若何任務、因舊病尙未完全復原、故特來滬、繼續就醫、京中無良醫、上海醫生、不能以余個人之故、延至京中診治、而耽誤上海之病人、故特來滬診治、並配製營滋藥、以備回洛服用、蓋該地不獨無良醫、且無良藥也、至最近赴莫干山晤汪先生與否、尙未决定、惟頗有此意耳、韓復榘與劉珍年糾紛事、雙方各執一是、殊難明其眞相、刻蔣委員長已派有力者、前往監視雙方軍事行動、俾免事件之擴大、一面更偵查其糾紛之起因、以便中央下公正之處斷、本人擬於明日（即今日）往訪孫哲生先生云云、</p>
<p>孫科出處　自汪赴莫干山孫科來滬後、孫長行政院消息、復囂塵上、記者昨以是詢林主席、林氏諉稱未知、據孫科左右表示、孫氏個人之地位、或是否能與某某合作等等、均不成問題、其關鍵乃在政府對外意見是否能趨一致、及整個外交上之有無辦法、否則即犧牲個人、於黨國何益云云、</p>

<h3>是非</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>我曾見外國敎科書中，有一段文字，他說，每個人有兩只袋子，一袋在前，一袋在後，在前者放他人的過失，在後者放自己的過失，故人的過失易見，而自己的過失難知，這眞是醒世名言，洞中人類「明於觀人昩於察己」的弊病，</p>
<p>昨據濟南電訊，蔣伯誠谈，據韓復榘報告，劉仍在優亂，據劉珍年報告，韓仍在壓迫，各執一詞，即中央亦不明眞相，當然雙方旣經用武，雙方各有認直不曲的理由，公說公有理，婆說婆有理，在報紙不過有聞必錄，天然更莫名其土地堂，未便加以批判，</p>
<p>不過「是非之不明，公道之不彰也久矣，」即如一手造成之僞满洲國，而日方猶强詞奪理，諉稱日軍在東省行動，係本正當合法之自衛權，满洲國之成立，係出於該地人民自由意志，而所謂主持公道的國聯，亦只有「遷就」「敷衍」，而不敢下一句公平的判斷，世界尙有什麽是非呢，</p>
<p>莊子曰，「民食芻豢，糜鹿食薦，螂且甘帶，鴟鴉耆鼠，四者孰知正味，自我觀之，仁義之端，是非之途，樊然殽亂，吾惡知其辨，」可知是非之難明，不自今日始矣，不過今則更甚，明明所行都非，而其言則句句皆是，我輩只有「非其所非而是其所是」「非其所非而是其所是　」結果等於無非無是、旣　無非無是，汝將用何道以判斷他們的是非呢，</p>

<h3>植物之人工繁殖法</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>普通植物的繁殖，大都是自然繁殖，其方法有由莖之蔓生的，有種子自己彈放，或借動物之携帶，或靠風之吹送，或靠水之飄流，把種子散佈出去，繁殖牠的種族；大槪草本植物，種子多，很適合自然繁殖法。但是花木果樹，種子極少，往往拿種子種出來的新植物，總不及老樹的好，所以繁殖花木果樹，不宜用自然繁殖法，而另用人工繁殖法，牠的方法，大槪可以分做揷枝，壓條，分栽，接枝等四種，略述之如下：</p>
<p>（一）揷枝法　多數植物，當其枝割斷後，揷在土裏，或以浸水之物裏之，即能生根，慢慢的生長起來，這是呌做揷枝法。扦揷的枝條，須將其葉略爲摘去，并且須揷在太陽極少的地方，可以減少水分之蒸發，而免枯槁之害，這揷枝法，大槪在立春前後或梅雨時，爲最適宜。楊柳，蔷藢，玫瑰，菊，石榴等花木果樹，均用此法以繁殖。</p>
<p>（二）壓條法　在早春或夏季，屈一植物之莖於地上，覆以泥土，等到生根時，乃分離之以成新植物，這是呌做壓條法，多數植物，如葡萄，朱藤，桑樹，槐樹等，都用這個方法，使牠繁殖的。　　（三）分栽法　分栽法有分根和分莖兩種，把根上新生的枝條，移植他處，呌做分根法；切斷近根處新生的側莖，移種别處，呌做分莖法。大槪蔓生的或地下莖的植物，如甘露，荸薺等，宜用分莖法；至於蠟梅，水仙，海棠等，宜用分根法。</p>
<p>（四）接枝法　用一植物之枝名新枝，揷於他一種植物之幹名砧木，使兩種植物之形成層相結合而生長，這是呌做接枝法。新枝和砧木，其種類必須非常相近，并且其大小須相等，或以小枝接於一大砧木上，大槪在早春，花木的各組織尙在休伏而生機將要發動的時候，應行接枝，日後各組織開始生長，新枝與砧木即聯合，傷口也即愈合：以後只要常常除去砧木所生之枝，以免砧木旺盛，而致新枝枯槁，現世鮮蜜果實，奇花異卉，都用此法以繁殖，同時改變牠的性質：如美國所有之最良蘋果，梨，橘等，均用此法以保存及繁殖優良之變種；若把十數類的櫻枝或多數的仙人掌，同接於一砧木，即可造成开式奇異之植物。</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>暑期不必廢除</h3>
<p>— 慈民</p>
<p>星期制在一般機關學校，早已是成爲習慣的了，大家這樣循例的過活着，不覺得什麽。突然振止君像睛天霹靂一樣地在本刋上高喊出廢除的口號，眞使我驚佩他的深思遠慮，但同時又覺得他老實得可憐，未免多事了，振止君「特將學校標出」，說明了對於該問題討論的範圍，所以我們的討論，當以學校爲中心。</p>
<p>我所持以爲不必廢除星期的理由如下：</p>
<p>以我國國民經濟的貧乏凋疲，致使大多數民衆，失去了受學校敎育的機會；以我國敎育内容的空虚，致使一部分享有特殊的優異敎育權的靑年，深造爲難；以我國新舊思想的激　，普遍的民衆生活的不安定，致使一般受敎育的靑年，徨彷顧盼。有此種種原因，而欲求我國一般民衆的知識水準提高，而欲求我國的科學昌明，根本便談不到。振止君不着眼於大的地方，竟捨本逐未·妙語生花·山星期日最不經濟，最浪費的觀點出發，跨過「多下功夫」，「增高民智」，「昌明科學」等臺階，而終止於國家强盛的結論。如這等差以毫厘失之千里的論法，是多麽近於玄想的奢望啊！</p>
<p>縱使退一步，我們承認「星期日可以廢除」試問振止君所欲廢除的星期日，是否能使一般的靑年學子，多下功夫，而逹於國家强盛的境地呢？我國的大學生，中學生，自然是國家的棟梁·前途最有希望的靑年，許多重大的責任，一大半都付託在他們的肩頭上，可是他們肯「多下功夫」嗎？普通說來，星期日當然是他們玩耍的日子，什麽看影戲，跳舞······何等有趣；在平時，老實說他們也是不肯「多下功夫」的。有一個朋肥，親自對我說，「本學期我只上了二十六節課，旁的便什麽都不管了。這雖是太拆瀾汚，然而，平時尙且如此不肯用心，不肯「多下功夫」的靑年，而必須要他在振止君所欲廢除的星期日「多下功夫」，這是可能的嗎？反過來說，那些平日很能「多下功夫」的有爲靑年，他們未必就肯把星期日的好光陰，付之流水吧，又何必要振止君這樣着急呢？如果振止君眞的要替一般靑年們把結時間，那末，一年一度的二個月暑假，三星期的寒假，振止君當然是認爲一曝十寒而要大聲疾呼的喊：「廢除暑假寒假」了，寄振止君，以爲如何？</p>
<p>我的意思是：星期制直接對於我國一般正在求學的靑年，没有妨礙他們「多下功夫」：要靑年們「肯多下功夫」廢除星期的建議，决計負不起這個使命，這是一個敎育問題，社會問題。惟其如此，所以星期制在間接方面，也没有妨礙我國的科學昌明，進一步也没有妨礙我國的國家强盛。星期制不是「不可廢除」，而是「不必廢除」。</p>
<p>其他如「星期制含有宗敎意味」，「廢除星期制，敎員盛覺乏味」「外國怎樣，中國古代怎樣」等問題，非但是離題太遠，且也很不切實際，恕我不加以討論了！</p>

<p>上海果眞繁華，有人說是東方的花都，意思是：可與法國的巴黎，並駕媲美·實則尤有超勝之處！上海有外人的治外法權，有名國的租界，有外兵駐紮，試問這些這些·巴黎可有？如此而曰「超勝」，孰謂不宜！</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>聽說滬上各工廠，近來都不願招收男工了，最大的原因自然是：男工俏皮，强悍，愛閙工潮，其次便是女工頗可調劑調劑職員的生活。</p>

<p>從白渡橋回來，感到有如看了一部歷史名劇，天空有時代飛機，橋上梭巡着摩登汽車電車，橋下呢，還有幾千年以前的遺跡丨民船，在那兒搖·唱·尤其是那些船上的泥黃色的裸體小孩同婦人，與橋上的粉脂囝囡，小姐，少奶，相映成趣。</p>

<p>一般上海人賺到十塊洋銀，至少以九塊有餘製衣紥身，食住次要，蓄積更大可不必·古聖只言「食色性也」，而今上海人還得添加衣著一生。</p>
<p>變</p>
<h3>愛的轉變</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>男　吾愛！你覺得嗎？你近來對我的態度完全變了，你不像從前那樣愛我了。</p>
<p>女　啊！是的，這也許是眞的吧，可是你也不像從前那樣能夠了解我了。</p>
<p>男　不，我還是同樣了解你，甚至於比以前更有進一步的了解，不過你完全和從前兩樣了，你最近簡直没有想到你對於戀愛所應盡的義務，你將我所獻給你的愛情太看輕便了。這使我非常難堪，有時甚至於使我感覺生命太無意義。</p>
<p>女　這是你的一種幻想·也許是你將我們的愛情估量得太高了，你現在對於我的要求太苛刻了，你那等於要求一個女人永遠是少女時代一樣；其實這是可能的嗎？我眞實的告訴你罷；在少女時代，我也曾經像你那樣的觀察過戀愛，我更熱列的戀愛過，我認爲人生最重要的意義便是戀愛，而且戀愛便是我生活的全部，但是，現在回想起來眞是可笑。當然，因爲那時我的觀察力太淺薄。現在人生經騐多了一些，覺得人生中有比戀愛更重要東西存在着，這就是說：我不能完全爲了戀愛而生活。</p>
<p>男　但是我却爲你可惜，我不懂你什麽時候有了這樣卑劣的意識？難道你要以輕薄的態度來侮辱我們神聖的戀愛嗎？</p>
<p>女　哈哈，戀愛神聖？别再這樣胡說罷。朋友！什麽是神聖的？你說罷，在現在這樣人吃人的時代，還有神聖的東西存在嗎？我說過：我從前也曾將戀愛當做我幸福的全部，可是所得着的是什麽呢？不是幸福，而是煩惱。這煩惱一直繼續到現在，甚至於有時爲着這煩惱而想去自殺；</p>
<p>男　不過，無論如何，你還得愛我，因爲我並没有變更我戀愛的觀念，我現在仍是愛你，甚至比以前更加愛你。我相信我能這樣繼續下去，一直到我死的時候。那末你應當考慮到你對於我所應盡的義務，你没有理由來减低你愛我的程度。</p>
<p>女　不，我的理由已經說過了，因爲我覺得我不能放棄比愛你還重要的事業便是我不能像從前那樣愛你的理由。</p>
<p>男　不，不能，一萬個不能。</p>
<p>女　不，不能也得能。老實說；你的愛確是妨害了我。你想將我整個的佔爲己有，整個的我都犧牲在你的愛情之中，那是决然不能的。朋友！我不是幾次的對你說過嗎？戀愛只是生活的一部，而不是生活的全部，戀愛只是增進生活的發展的，而不是阻撓生活發展的。假如一個人爲了戀愛而生活，那便將生活估價得過於低下了。不錯，我愛你，你是我生活中所需要的，但是我更要愛人類，我更要愛勞苦大衆，我更要爲被壓迫大衆謀解放，因爲這是我生活的發展，生活的向上。　　男　哦！　　　　，你要毁滅我　。　　女　對哪！你當我是惡魔罷。你打我，你咒咀我，並請你在可能的範圍中忘記了我罷。······啊！這是多麽痛快的一回事呀！</p>

<h3>League of Nations Bell</h3>
<p>What is the purpose of sacrificing an ox? The ox's fate is sealed. How can one expect others to not bear to see its trembling and replace it? People see this huge creature, lacking in intelligence and strength, only seeking pity. They say that death is its fate, so what is there to complain about? Those who maintain the dignity of the temple only hope that this bell can produce a grand and far-reaching sound, so they do not hesitate to sacrifice an ox. Now the butcher is already wielding his knife, only one cut away. The cut will also be made before long. But whether the bell that is being consecrated will be able to ring with a clear and loud sound in the future, so as to display its power and dignity, I fear that those who sit high above the temple have no clear plan. Over the past year, the eyes and ears of the people of the country have been constantly focused on the League of Nations and the report of the League of Nations Investigation Team, believing that the supreme government's League of Nations will be able to uphold justice, and that wherever justice lies, it will be able to restrain Japan. Therefore, the League of Nations was followed in word and deed, step by step, bowing and scraping, submissive and afraid to move. However, there is no hope for the future, and it is not necessary to wait until now to be able to determine this. The weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations' attitude has long been fully exposed. In order to maintain the dignity of its temple and hope that its prestige will not be damaged, it has repeatedly yielded to Japan's demands. Now, it is again yielding to Japan's demands by postponing the discussion of the Investigation Team's report. The reason why the League of Nations allowed the postponement of the discussion of the report is not to seek a solution to the Far Eastern issue, but because it has no way to solve it and has to seek a way to step down. The League of Nations clearly knows that Japan's arrogance is beyond its ability to restrain. Since the League of Nations cannot restrain Japan, it turns to dealing with Japan. However, constantly dealing with Japan, it is also afraid of revealing its true face as being manipulated by a powerful country. Therefore, it hopes that the Sino-Japanese incident can be resolved quickly. However, the strategy for a quick resolution cannot be achieved in one fell swoop, and delaying is also not a good idea. Therefore, its final strategy is to hope to shift its responsibility to both China and Japan, and encourage them to negotiate directly. If China and Japan can negotiate directly, then it does not matter how China's territory is divided, how its sovereignty is infringed, and how its people are trampled upon. On the surface, the Far Eastern incident has been properly resolved. The League of Nations can also be happy that its responsibility has been completed. This is not our speculation. According to recent newspaper reports, the conclusion of the League of Nations Investigation Team's report still returns to the path of direct negotiation in a roundabout and tortuous way. The League of Nations instructs China and Japan to negotiate directly, and the principles are: (1) Manchuria only retains nominal Chinese sovereignty. (2) Grant Manchuria extensive autonomy. Under the above two conditions, China and Japan will hold direct negotiations. If this kind of news is really true, then there is no need to give the butcher full authority to dissect the ox. The ox has indeed been sacrificed, but what effect will the bell consecrated by the League of Nations have?</p>
<p>The Charter of the League of Nations is the bell that the League of Nations holds to call for world peace and maintain its prestige. Now, using this method to solve the Sino-Japanese problem, can it not damage the dignity of the Charter of the League of Nations? I am afraid that the League of Nations' bell will not only be insufficient to ring for peace and maintain its prestige, but will also be destroyed by this sacrifice.</p>

<p>Sitao Railway Open to Bamiancheng</p>
<p>Su's Troops Rebel and the Japanese Suffer a Blow</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Bai'en, the commander of the First Detachment of the Volunteer Army, led more than 1,000 men on the 27th, carrying steel cannons, machine guns, and hand grenades, and fiercely attacked Zhengjiatun, burning the Japanese post office there and setting fire to the ammunition depot. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. After a night of fierce fighting, the Volunteer Army completely occupied Zhengjiatun at 9:00 am on the 28th. The Sitao Railway is open to Bamiancheng. In this battle, the Volunteer Army suffered more than 300 casualties. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

The entire city of Tongliao was on fire, and the situation was extremely chaotic. The Volunteer Army has destroyed the prison and released the prisoners.

<h3>### Su Bingwen's Troops Attack Heihe</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen's road protection team of the China Eastern Railway suddenly rebelled and occupied Manzhouli. The Japanese and puppet groups were greatly shocked.

Last month, Zhang Shouge's brigade stationed in Zhalantun rebelled. Su immediately contacted Zhang, and at the same time, Ma Zhanshan also sent representatives to and from Su and Zhang, agreeing to launch a general attack on Bokui at the end of this month. Because Su's military preparations were sufficient, in response to Ma Zhanshan, he rebelled in Manzhouli on the 27th and disbanded all the customs and border inspection offices set up by the puppet state. The troops have recently added two cavalry brigades and are advancing along the China Eastern Railway to Bokui. The situation has been reported to the central government and Beiping by Su.

Liu's army has withdrawn from Qixia and gathered in Laizhou, Laiyang, and the surrounding countryside. Liu's army's inactivity is widely believed to have other intentions, intending to take advantage of Han's army's attention to Yantai to launch a surprise attack.

<h3>Japanese Envoy's Visit to the Mausoleum Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Luo Wengan Hosted a Banquet for the Japanese Envoy Last Night</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter interviewed the Japanese envoy, Ariyoshi, on the 29th and recorded the following conversation: (Reporter asked) Your Excellency, having presented your credentials, what efforts will you make to restore friendly relations between China and Japan in the future? (Envoy Ariyoshi replied) Restoring friendly relations between China and Japan is indeed my greatest desire. However, the restoration of Sino-Japanese relations depends on mutual understanding and sympathy between the people of both countries. I will make my greatest efforts in this regard, but I have no specific measures. (Asked) The Sino-Japanese dispute has reached a stalemate. There are frequent rumors of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. Are you entrusted with this mission? (Answered) China and Japan are two major neighboring countries in East Asia. In principle, it is appropriate to have direct negotiations in case of disputes. However, judging from the current situation, the Sino-Japanese dispute has become a stalemate, and direct negotiations are almost impossible. I have not been entrusted with a mission of direct negotiation. The report of the League of Nations investigation team is about to be published, and the League of Nations General Assembly will be held soon. Our government is now waiting for the publication of the report and the proceedings of the League of Nations General Assembly. Your government probably feels the same way. Therefore, the talk of direct negotiations is only a rumor and is absolutely untrustworthy. (Asked) The representative of your country attending the League of Nations General Assembly recently requested the League of Nations to postpone the discussion of the investigation team's report. Our people are very incomprehensible about this. May I ask what is your country's intention in requesting the postponement of the discussion? (Answered) Although I have not received instructions from the government on this matter, as far as I know, it is only because the report is of great importance that the discussion is postponed to allow sufficient time for translation and detailed study. (Asked) The League of Nations General Assembly in November will presumably seek an appropriate solution to the Sino-Japanese problem. Although the method of resolution is not yet known, what attitude does your government hold towards this League of Nations General Assembly, and can it absolutely obey the resolutions of the League of Nations General Assembly? Please enlighten me. (Answered) I do not know my government's attitude towards this League of Nations General Assembly at this time. The investigation team's report is about to be released, and its contents are not yet clear. It is difficult to predict how the General Assembly will resolve the issue in the future. Therefore, our government has not yet decided whether to obey or not. (Asked) How long will you stay in Beijing, and will you have any contact with our diplomatic authorities? (Answered) I am here purely to present my credentials and have no other tasks. Therefore, I do not intend to have any contact with your authorities. I will leave for Shanghai tomorrow night (the 30th). (Central News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>

<h3>Central Political Council Decides on Measures to Eliminate Sichuan War</h3>
<p>Shi Qingyang Mediates with Sichuan Army Representatives</p>
<p>Representatives Telegraph Their Respective Armies to Dissuade Them</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It has been widely rumored in recent days that a war in Sichuan is about to break out. Today, someone met with Shi Qingyang and inquired about the truth in Sichuan. According to Shi, he has not yet received a confirmed report on this matter. If it unfortunately becomes a reality, it will have a great impact on diplomacy. Currently, the central authorities are devising methods to prevent the chaos from occurring and are mediating between the various armies. According to Leng Rong, representative of Liu Wenhui, the army has not received official telegrams reporting the outbreak of war in Sichuan. The situation in Sichuan is extremely complicated, and the relations between the various armies are also very intricate. If they do not understand each other, conflicts may occur. The central authorities attach great importance to this, as the entire country is now united against foreign aggression. Tang, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, submitted a report, and the Central Committee members decided on measures to stop it. The first step is for Shi, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to first gather representatives of the Sichuan armies and try to mediate, hoping that the war will not occur. If it is still ineffective, the central authorities will seek appropriate and effective measures to stop it. My opinion is the same as the central authorities, and I am discussing specific methods with Shi and representatives of the Sichuan armies to stop the war. At the same time, I hope that the Central Committee members from Sichuan who are outside the province can also telegraph the generals in Sichuan, calling for peace. I previously advocated the establishment of a committee in Sichuan to focus on politics, military affairs, and construction under the three principles of facing national crisis together, reducing military preparations, and unified construction, and promoted Zhang Qun to return to Sichuan to contact the generals. However, this was suspended because Zhang was ordered to go to Peiping. I still hold this view now. (Special dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Qingyang hosted a luncheon for Leng Jiesheng, Xie Tianmin, Fu Changwei, Zeng Kuoqing, and other representatives of the Sichuan armies stationed in Beijing on the afternoon of the 29th. During the banquet, considerable progress was made in discussing the mediation of the Sichuan war. It was decided that each representative should urgently telegram their respective armies, stating the central government's intention to stop the war. (Special dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Newspaper reports indicate that the two Lius in Sichuan are brewing a civil war, which is on the verge of breaking out. When the petition group from the people of Xikang left Hankou, they issued a circular expressing their deep concern that the impending war in Sichuan would hinder the incorporation of the people of Xikang. According to a certain gentleman from related parties on the 29th, Guo Xun's troops have advanced to Baokang in their attack on the remnants of He Long, and there is no transfer back to Sichuan. Kang Lv of Fan Shaozeng's division has also been dispatched to Hubei to assist in the defense. With the current national crisis, a Sichuan war should not occur, and no one is likely to take the lead in starting a war. Reports of both sides deploying their lines may be exaggerated.

According to a recent provincial telegram, Jiang Guangnai and Fang Shengtao jointly telegraphed on the 28th to appoint Hong Wende as acting Brigade Commander of the First Provincial Defense Brigade. Hong was Chen's former Chief of Staff. Jiang has a complete plan to resolve the issue of Chen's troops, and Chen is the most vicious bandit in Fujian Province. Military intelligence also indicates that the seven cities of Quanzhou have been closed since the 28th, and there are strict inspections for entry and exit. Martial law has been declared inside and outside the city. Since the 28th, all car roads in Quanzhou, Yongchun, and Xianyou have stopped transportation due to the requisition of vehicles. Only handcarts and rickshaws are available. Fellow villagers' associations in Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Yongchun have sent telegrams to the province, requesting that Chen be executed according to law.

<h3>Ministry of Railways Rectifies Railway Administration</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Because various agencies have not complied with the "Regulations on Free Train Rides and Account Booking for State-Owned Railways" promulgated by the National Government, there are officials who are not stipulated in the regulations who are booking accounts with the railway bureaus, and there are those who are booking accounts with the railway bureaus without directly contacting the ministry, and there are even those who book accounts without repaying or simply refusing to acknowledge them, resulting in fictitious accounts on various roads and difficulty in auditing. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways has re-established six measures to restrict free tickets and rectify railway administration and has issued a circular to all roads for compliance.

<h3>Shi Qingyang Discusses the Future of the Kang-Tibetan Dispute</h3>
<p>The Government Should Send Senior Officials to Conduct Actual Inspections</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama's Representative Responsibly Claims a Strong Desire for Peace</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, stated that the Sichuan-Kang border defense army and the Tibetan army are still holding each other in the front, and there is no war. Regarding the methods to resolve the Kang-Tibetan dispute, on the one hand, both sides should be ordered to stop military actions and each stay at their original defense without invading each other; on the other hand, the government should select and dispatch senior officials to conduct actual inspections to serve as a basis for resolution, so as not to be deceived by documents and telegrams. According to the Dalai Lama's representative, they are very willing to have peace and have telegraphed Chairman Chiang in detail, reporting everything. The rumors that there are foreigners as a background and that a Greater Tibet is being established are not true. As for the minority Mongolian banners in the eastern provinces after they were forcibly occupied by the violent Japanese, they are inevitably being trampled on. Currently, in addition to sending personnel or using words to comfort them, all alliances are ordered to strengthen their self-defense forces to resist foreign aggression. (Special dispatch of the 29th)</p>

<h3>Strictly Prevent Fishing Boats from Evading Taxes</h3>

The Ministry of Finance ordered the customs offices of various seaports to collect a tax of four yuan per dan on the fish caught by Japanese fishing boats when they are transported to our country for sale in order to compensate for losses. However, Japanese fishermen have been finding ways to circumvent this and colluding with unscrupulous merchants, privately sending boats to export and directly purchasing from Japanese fishing boats and carrying them back in order to evade taxes. After the customs discovered this, they reported it to the Ministry of Finance, which ordered the anti-smuggling team to conduct strict inspections. (Special dispatch of the 29th)</p>

<h3>Current Situation of Captured Englishmen in Niuzhuang</h3>
<p>Yingkou: According to a Chinese informant, Mrs. Bowles and Mr. Kirkland are being held in a small village approximately 160 li southwest of Anshan and 40 li northwest of Panshan. This village is located at the junction of Haicheng and Panshan counties and is the stronghold of bandits Ma Xishan, Bai Batian, and Zhu Zhang (all transliterations). It is surrounded by paddy fields, wetlands, and several embankments, making it difficult to enter and easy to defend. Bowles and Kirkland are currently living in the thatched house of the village head, Zhou. They are wearing Chinese clothes to keep warm and eating Chinese food to stave off hunger. Mrs. Bowles is reportedly in good condition, as the bandits see her as a treasure. It is said that Mr. Kirkland occasionally shows signs of resentment and is subsequently whipped by the bandits. Huang Tianzhong, the garrison commander of the Liaohe area, is making every effort to rescue them. Any subordinate who provides information or proposes a plan leading to the rescue of the two will be granted an exceptional promotion. (Reuter's dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Niuzhuang received a letter from Mrs. Bowles yesterday, written on the back of an old Chinese envelope. The translation is as follows: "Today, the messenger is here, so I am writing this short reply. The bandit leader says he urgently needs money to support us. He has written to you requesting a ransom, but he has not told us the amount. If the messenger does not return within five days, we will suffer terrible torture. Within ten days, it will be unbearable. Please rescue us quickly, as we cannot bear to be so filthy. We urgently need soap now. The bandits once helped us with this item, etc." The above is most of the letter. The last sentence proves that all the parcels sent have been opened and stolen by the bandits, with only the soap left behind. The letter was sent on September 26th, the same day as the bandit's letter, suggesting it was written in haste. The use of an old Chinese envelope also indicates a severe shortage of paper. Furthermore, the messenger who brought the bandit's latest demands did not mention receiving the parcels and letters sent to Mrs. Bowles, indicating they were not received. The bandit's letter was written in cursive script on rough paper with careless handwriting. It demands a ransom of 1.2 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan from the previous demand. In addition, the following items are also requested: 200 taels of high-quality opium, to be delivered by the next messenger, and other items to be delivered within a week, or the two will have their ears cut off. The list includes: 50 bundles of silk, 100 gold rings, 30 gold pocket watches, 30 gold wristwatches, 2 machine guns, 200,000 rounds of machine gun ammunition (an increase from the previous request), 6 light automatic rifles (with ammunition), 4 Mauser rifles (with ammunition), and 120 pistols (with ammunition). The letter was not sealed and was handed to the messenger who had just arrived at the bandit's lair to bring back. The above demands are considered madness here. It is hoped that when other messengers return to Niuzhuang, progress can be made through earnest negotiations. The weather has been improving recently, and travel for messengers is more convenient. One or two messengers should be returning soon. (Reuter's dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>The bandits who kidnapped the two Englishmen in Niuzhuang have made even more outrageous demands. This afternoon, a messenger arrived here from the bandit's lair, carrying two letters. Due to heavy rain, travel was difficult, taking six days round trip. Both letters were sent on September 26th, one a private letter from Mrs. Bowles to her parents, the other a letter from the bandit leader. The bandit's letter has two more signatures than before. They are demanding a total ransom of 1 million yuan, 300,000 yuan less than before, but the demand for military equipment is even greater. According to the messenger, he was not allowed to speak to the captives, but when he arrived at the bandit's lair, he saw the two Englishmen eating, unbound, and seemingly able to move freely within a limited area. They appeared to be in good health. The messenger was tied up when he entered the bandit's lair, but released after seeing the bandit leader. The bandit leader's new demands are unacceptable, so everyone is worried again. The bandit's letter also threatens to cut off ears and present them if the demands are not met within a few days. The content of Mrs. Bowles' private letter has not yet been announced tonight, but it is said to be brief, with no special requests, only reiterating the plea for an early rescue. There was no letter from Mr. Kirkland. (Reuter's dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Two more messengers returned to Niuzhuang today. The first brought letters from Mrs. Bowles and Mr. Kirkland, and a letter from the bandit leader. The second brought a letter from the bandit leader to Mr. Bowles' father, Dr. Phillips. Huang Tianzhong, the garrison commander of Niuzhuang, offered to enlist the bandits in the army if they release the two Englishmen, but the bandits refused. The bandit leader's letter to Dr. Phillips stated briefly: "We will never agree to the surrender proposal, please do not mention it again. We hope you will quickly raise the money. The gifts have all been received. What are you talking about now? We will not settle for anything less than 1.2 million yuan." Below this, he listed the required amount of equipment and ended with: "If someone is coming, send them quickly. No more words." The letters from Mrs. Bowles and Mr. Kirkland were very sad and were written on the back of previous letters. (Reuter's dispatch from the 29th)</p>

<h3>British and French Representatives Vigorously Defend the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Herriot States That France Takes the Covenant as a Diplomatic Principle</p>
<p>Cecil Advocates the League of Nations Imposing Sanctions in the Far East</p>
<p>Yan Huijing Requests Hymans to Convene a Special Committee of Nineteen Nations</p>
<p>To Discuss the Deadline for the General Assembly to Discuss the Lytton Report</p>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from Geneva, the 29th: At the opening of the League of Nations Assembly on Sunday, the President, Mr. Valera, said in his opening speech that the world criticized the Assembly for only handling minor matters while neglecting the major issues that were most relevant to the world's people. At today's General Assembly meeting, French Prime Minister Herriot gave a passionate response to Valera's remarks, saying that France did not hold such a pessimistic view and trusted the League of Nations and its future. The League of Nations had achieved many successes, such as the World Court, the Lausanne Conference, and the Locarno Conference, all of which were products of the League of Nations. The French Prime Minister did not criticize the haste with which some countries in the League of Nations were handling disarmament issues, saying that a code of international peace could not be drafted in a hurry. British representative Cecil spoke in support of the views expressed by Herriot.</p>
<h3>Herriot Announces Confidence in the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Geneva, the 29th: At 11:00 this morning, in the crowded League of Nations General Assembly, French Prime Minister Herriot took the podium and delivered a speech, the main points of which are as follows: "The general discussion of the issues at the League of Nations General Assembly is to consider the public opinion of various countries. Before this discussion is concluded, France is willing to express its thoughts on the platform and announce its confidence in the League of Nations. The current Chairman of the Administrative Council, Mr. Fan Riele, has raised the following question: Is the League of Nations suffering from a serious illness, or is it just a temporary crisis? The President of the General Assembly, Mr. Politis, in view of the dangers of the world situation, has also repeatedly urged us to redouble our efforts in the work of peace. In the past year, the League of Nations itself has carried out many activities. The Disarmament Conference relies on it to produce results, and the Lausanne Conference relies on it to succeed. According to common sense, the League of Nations General Assembly should act cautiously and should not recklessly make statements that disrupt the calm atmosphere of the Assembly. At this General Assembly, although we are troubled by various issues, we should not hinder the resolution of issues with misguided actions. We must painstakingly manage to complete the drafting of domestic codes to regulate the lives of individuals, and it is even more difficult to complete the drafting of a code of international peace. France is willing to work hard to ensure the success of the Disarmament Conference and to achieve general benefits. Our urgent task is to approach current events, settle the overall account of the past, and transform the old system of centuries. The diplomatic principle that France adheres to is nothing more than covenants. Beyond covenants, there is nothing more to seek, because the League of Nations Covenant is like law to us." Herriot stated that it was deeply regrettable that the great democracy of the United States was unable to attend, but he repeatedly praised the efforts of those with lofty ideals in that country (referring to Hoover and Stimson) for their vigorous support of the Pact of Paris. Herriot then briefly reviewed major international events in the past year and placed particular emphasis on the Lausanne Treaty and the spirit of the League of Nations. The French Prime Minister then spoke of the satisfactory results of the Stresa Economic Conference, saying that in this conference, Germany, Britain, Italy, France, and Eastern European agricultural countries showed signs of sincere unity, proving that Stresa was only the beginning of opening up new paths. France will spare no sacrifice to achieve the realization of this plan. Herriot also said that the Lausanne Conference, although only a preparatory work, has paved the way for the World Economic and Monetary Conference to be held soon. In short, what we have gained in the past year is already not small. The current events have shown the necessity of the existence of the League of Nations. The League of Nations has two major enemies, namely the spirit of restoration and the spirit of the mob. What the League of Nations needs now is to avoid the harm of these two enemies and proceed with its work. The League of Nations' ability is certainly not enough to eliminate violence, but it is the duty of the League of Nations to use legal means to ease disputes. France is eager to strive to adopt such means as much as possible without being biased. This is why the French delegation does not support all pessimistic views on Geneva." In his speech, he recalled the late Aristide Briand and praised his eloquence. Herriot's concluding remarks hoped to gain the trust of the representatives of all countries, saying, "Let us not throw away our oars halfway, only on the day when our will is weak will we encounter great danger."</p>
<p>National News Agency dispatch from Geneva, the 29th: The speech of French Prime Minister Herriot at the League of Nations General Assembly this morning has been awaited for a long time. However, after Herriot took the stage, he only read a lengthy article, which seemed to have been prepared in advance by the French delegation. Herriot only read it through without any gestures, and his eyes never left the manuscript. Finally, he summarized the principles of France's League of Nations policy: (1) abolishing secret diplomacy; (2) gradually abolishing the old alliance system and replacing it with a new system of cooperation among countries based on peace; (3) seeking progressive development of international arbitration and international law. The conclusion stated that France is not passive and asked all countries not to be disappointed. Herriot's speech only received lukewarm applause because its content was empty, and people in the League of Nations believed that it did not help solve the current urgent problems.</p>
<h3>Speech by British Representative Cecil</h3>
<p>National News Agency dispatch from Geneva, the 29th: British representative Cecil gave a powerful speech at the League of Nations General Assembly today, vigorously defending the League of Nations and criticizing member states for only caring about their own countries, causing the League of Nations to be unable to smoothly resolve major international issues. He also had shocking and enlightening remarks on the Manchurian issue. Cecil is known for his enthusiastic support of the League of Nations. This time, he criticized France and Germany without any pretense, frankly declaring that if these two countries could agree, 75% of the world's unrest could be eliminated. Cecil urged all countries to show a determination to abandon selfish ideas and wavering attitudes on the most important issue of military equipment, stating, "Shall we disarm? This question must be answered with 'yes' or 'no'. Otherwise, ambiguous perfunctoryness will inevitably lead to a re-enactment of the situation before the European war, which is far worse than today." Then, he spoke painfully about the Manchurian situation and the Sino-Japanese dispute, with fair reasoning and strict words, frankly declaring, "If the League of Nations Covenant could be implemented in the Far East, the League of Nations would not be in today's difficult position." He then asked rhetorically, "Why did the League of Nations not impose sanctions in the Far East?" and said, "I do not want to answer the reason for this, but I believe that either this party or that party, or even both parties, are guilty of violating the Covenant." Cecil's eloquence not only shocked the audience, but his words also came from the heart, so the entire audience was deeply moved, especially his frank words on the Manchurian issue and his painful statement on the necessity of French and German agreement and disarmament, which left a deep impression.</p>
<h3>The Future of the League of Nations and the Sino-Japanese Problem</h3>
<p>National News Agency dispatch from Geneva, the 29th: According to the opinion of impartial observers here, the future of the League of Nations will depend on whether its next General Assembly can find a suitable solution to the Sino-Japanese problem. Today, no one in the conference room imagines that the League of Nations can force Japan to return Manchuria to China, but those who support the League of Nations all hope to find a solution or adopt a policy that will eventually promote the collapse of the current situation in the Far East and allow Manchuria to return to China. This section does not recognize the Lytton Commission report, but it must be based on the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, treating Manchuria as part of China's complete territory as the basis for the report, which is why Japan is extremely dissatisfied and openly declares that the government refuses to accept any solution that recognizes China's sovereignty in Manchuria. It is believed that Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations before a solution to this case is found. According to observers, the League of Nations has only two paths at this time. The first path is to completely surrender and recognize that Manchuria is no longer owned by China. The second path is to reiterate the policy of not recognizing territories obtained in violation of international treaties, followed by the formulation of practical plans to exert strong pressure on Japan to implement this policy. If the League of Nations follows the first path, it will effectively acknowledge that it has become a useless organization for international events. Cecil has long held this view in his heart, so he gave this painful speech today to encourage the audience. If the League of Nations really does this, all international conferences will be shaken, the Disarmament Conference will prepare to fail quickly, the economic recovery will be delayed, and the foundation for the next world war has already been prepared. However, no one dares to believe that the League of Nations will take this path, but it is extremely doubtful whether a way can be found to make Japan return Manchuria to China.</p>
<h3>Yan Huijing Requests Convening a Special Committee</h3>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from Geneva, the 28th: Chinese chief representative Dr. Yan today submitted to the League of Nations Secretariat the Chinese government's statement issued on September 20, detailing Japan's various acts of destroying international agreements in the three northeastern provinces and ordering Japan to bear the responsibility for the consequences arising from its acts of aggression. Dr. Yan also requested Mr. Hymans, chairman of the Special Committee of Nineteen, to convene the Special Committee to consider and decide on the six-month deadline for the League of Nations General Assembly to discuss the Lytton Commission report. This deadline began in early July, but it is hoped that the study of this report can be completed before November 1. Dr. Yan stated that the Chinese government attaches great importance to this issue and hopes that the Special Committee will find a way to prevent Japan from taking advantage of the delay to make the situation more serious.</p>
<h3>Henderson Departs for London</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Geneva, the 28th: Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson requested newspapers to publish the following message: "The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference will depart for London in the evening. Before departing, he will continue to talk with representatives of various countries. The Chairman has successively consulted with Mr. Bulla, Mr. Letort, Mr. Benes, Mr. Zaleski, Mr. Hymans, and Mr. Madariaga. The Presidium will reopen its meeting on October 10. The Chairman deeply hopes that when he returns to Geneva on that day to attend this meeting, the work will have already made considerable progress, so that he can prepare a report and submit it to the next meeting of the Presidium, and the procedures to be adopted for security and equality issues can also be considered."</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Returns Home Early</h3>
<p>National News Agency dispatch from Geneva, the 28th: German Foreign Minister Neurath has recently decided to return home early because after French Prime Minister Herriot delivered his speech in Grama, the future of Germany's demand for equal armaments has become bleak. German diplomatic figures in Geneva had hoped to establish a compromise through British mediation, but the French Prime Minister's views are such that Germany feels that France's attitude towards Germany today is the same as when Poincaré was in power.</p>
<p>The German side has now decided to temporarily put aside the issue of participating in the Disarmament Conference, but if it can continue to discuss armament issues through normal diplomatic means, Germany has no intention of refusing.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Berlin, the 28th: German Foreign Minister Neurath returned to the country from Geneva at 5:00 PM. Neurath left Geneva before Prime Minister Herriot's speech tomorrow, which was ordered by Prime Minister von Papen. Informal sources said that Neurath's trip was a deliberate attempt to fully expose the recent serious diplomatic situation. It is not yet certain whether Neurath will meet with President Hindenburg after returning to Berlin, but there is no doubt that he will meet with von Papen and General Schleicher, as Germany's attitude towards the entire armament issue is controlled by Schleicher's influence. The Cabinet will hold a cabinet meeting on Friday to study the current situation in order to take important decisions. The psychology of the people in Berlin can be seen from the tone of Wolff Telegraph Agency's response to Herriot's speech by von Papen. The general idea is that Germany's demand for equality in armaments has failed, and the responsibility for the failure lies entirely with France.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Berlin, the 28th: German Foreign Minister Neurath's return to Berlin before Herriot's speech has made a deep impression in German political circles. The day after France replied to the German government's note, Berlin declared that Foreign Minister Neurath would be able to make considerable contact with France after arriving in Geneva. Now, the rhetoric has changed, saying that what Germany hopes for has already been clearly stated, and there is no need to repeat French-German contact. The French representative should have taken the lead, but France did not take the lead, so the failure to contact each other is the fault of France. Some people believe that General Schleicher has repeatedly declared that he cannot involve the government and should be personally responsible, while all newspapers believe that Schleicher's declaration is enough to express the government's intentions. As for the nationalist newspapers, they criticized von Papen, saying that the Prime Minister had guaranteed that Germany had no intention of restoring armaments, and the wording was too sharp and left no room for maneuver. They also said that the draft prepared in Geneva, which wanted to link disarmament with security, was nothing more than a "fraudulent attempt." Judging from the above rhetoric, it can be seen that Germany will fiercely oppose any international supervision.</p>
<h3>Bolivian and Paraguayan Representatives Deliver Speeches</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Geneva, the 28th: At today's League of Nations General Assembly meeting, Bolivian representative Costa de Rieles spoke in response to yesterday's speech by the Paraguayan representative. Costa first praised the chairman of the previous Administrative Council, Mr. Mados, for his efforts to avoid bloodshed between the two countries in the name of the League of Nations, saying that Bolivia had suffered deeply from repeated wars and was eager to adopt peaceful means. He dared not assume responsibility for the delay. The Paraguayan representative spoke on the spot, saying that he had heard Costa's peaceful protection and deeply hoped that both Bolivia and Paraguay could abide by the advice of the League of Nations. Chairman Politis said that the declarations of both countries were full of compromise and deeply hoped that they could uphold peace. Then, Swiss President Motta spoke, saying that at this General Assembly, representatives of various countries had not spoken much, and there were often misunderstandings from the outside. In fact, important issues such as disarmament, the Sino-Japanese dispute, and the World Economic Conference were all being handled by specialized meetings. Representatives of various countries at this General Assembly were not in a position to intervene, so they did not express their opinions. As for some people who confused the responsibility of the League of Nations with the responsibility of general countries, it was unreasonable. There were also some countries that made special demands and threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations if they were not satisfied. It was better for the League of Nations to be dissolved once and for all. Small countries would lose their potential influence in international politics, and powerful countries would once again show their true colors. Therefore, anyone who does not regard international security as necessary, we will no longer call them human beings. In the end, peace in the world should be protected by the League of Nations.</p>

<p>English Translation: Reuters, London, 28th: Following a cabinet meeting this morning, the announcement was made that three key cabinet members and seven other cabinet members had resigned. In the evening, official circles declared that the King had approved their resignations and had approved their successors. The current Minister of Agriculture, Gilmore, will be transferred to the position of Home Secretary, and his vacated position will be filled by the current Secretary of the Treasury, Conservative Party member Elliot. Liberal Party member Collines will become the Secretary of State for Scotland. As for the position of Lord Privy Seal vacated by Snowden, no successor has yet been announced. Before the cabinet members resigned, the cabinet had studied whether the legislation regarding the Ottawa Agreement could be postponed. The majority ultimately deemed it impossible, leading to the resignations of Snowden and others. Another cabinet meeting was held in the afternoon, with the three resigning ministers naturally absent. The resigning Liberal Party cabinet members jointly drafted a letter of resignation, recounting past events, stating that they had jointly resigned with Liberal Party member Maclean and Labour Party member Snowden in January, but withdrew their resignations due to repeated retentions by the Prime Minister and others. They also stated that the Ottawa Agreement endangered imperial interests, damaged the power of the British Parliament, hindered trade, and would increase unemployment, and declared that they would continue to assist the government on issues such as the Indian situation and international disarmament. Labour Party member Snowden sent a separate letter to the Prime Minister, heavily criticizing the government's protectionist policies, stating that he not only resigned unsuccessfully in January, but also resolved to withdraw from the cabinet a month ago after the cabinet considered the report of the Ottawa delegation. The main purpose of the National Government's organization was to deal with the national emergency, and now that this purpose has been achieved, protectionist policies are greatly detrimental to the country and will cause the division rather than the unity of the empire, and are not only a major disaster for Britain's international relations. When the Conservative Party first joined the National Government, there was no tariff issue. The result of increasing taxes has not helped industry, but has only made domestic and international development unfavorable. The agreement brought back by the British delegation from Ottawa was a compromise to avoid a breakdown of the conference. The Prime Minister also issued an article explaining his own position and that of other Labour Party cabinet members, stating that they would still express the same determination as they did a year ago when they joined hands to deal with major events, regardless of all ordinary party interests. Their work cannot be completed until the reparations and debt issues are resolved and the World Economic Conference is held, and they will continue to proceed. They will tell the people as they did a year ago that the country needs a non-partisan government, and that if it is purely party-minded, it will weaken Britain's power in the world and damage the current movement to seek national recovery. Reuters, London, 29th: Liberal Party members of Parliament met last night, with thirty people attending and five absent. They then passed a motion expressing their continued active support for the government, and congratulated Foreign Secretary Simon and Trade Secretary Runciman on remaining in office.</p>
<p>路透社二十九日倫敦電今晨各大報評論閣員辭職事、泰晤士報指此爲時機不合之離異、但謂破裂尙易於修補、晨郵報謂辭職目的、不在恢復自由貿易、但在恢復自由黨、彙聞報爲辭職賀、以其恢復自由黨行動自由也、每日驛報謂内閣之錯、史諾登亦不能逃責、</p>
<p>English Translation: Reuters, London, 29th: This morning, major newspapers commented on the resignation of cabinet members. The Times pointed out that this was a separation at an inopportune time, but said that the rupture was still easy to repair. The Morning Post said that the purpose of the resignation was not to restore free trade, but to restore the Liberal Party. The News Chronicle congratulated the resignation, because it restored the Liberal Party's freedom of action. The Daily Express said that Snowden cannot escape responsibility for the cabinet's mistake.</p>

<p>English Translation: National News Agency, Washington, 28th: Today, the Treasury Department announced that two installments of German debt to the U.S. totaling 8.26 million gold dollars, due on September 30, will have their payment extended. One installment is for the payment of private reparations from the European war, accounting for about two-thirds of the total amount. The other installment is for the cost of the U.S. troops stationed in the Rhineland. Now, because Germany has claimed inability to pay, the payment will be postponed. Also, the two similar installments due on March 31 of next year may also be extended if a new method has not been agreed upon by then. All circles are paying close attention to today's announcement of the extension of German debt, because the war debts owed by France, Britain, and Italy are due on December 15.</p>

The incident occurred at 6 p.m. Watson was riding in a car with his female secretary, Rose, when another car suddenly sped up from behind and fired several shots at Watson's car.

<p>English Translation: In the vicinity of Zhaoyuan, there have been many incidents of looting by deserters. It is reported that several hundred officers and soldiers of Liu's troops who arrived in Zhaoyuan on the 25th were surrounded by local people's self-defense corps, killing more than a hundred of them, and the rest scattered and fled. Ma Ming'e, the magistrate of Zhaoyuan County, is still in the city. Han Fuju, after receiving a telegram from Cao Fulin, commander of the 29th Division, has telegraphed He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, reporting the situation of Liu's troops deserting and causing disturbances. As for Liu's army withdrawing from various places, Han has dispatched Li Xuande's cavalry brigade to maintain order. Li's brigade arrived in Longkou on the 25th and Yantai on the 26th. It is said that they will arrive in Huangxian today (27th). It has been investigated that Liu Zhennian's defense area originally had twelve counties, and the county magistrates were mostly recommended by him, and the provincial government only added appointments as a matter of routine. This time, when the provincial army arrived in Yexian, the first thing it did was to remove Jia Guangwen, the magistrate of Yexian County, and temporarily replace him with Zhao Hongze. Zhu Kuisheng, the magistrate of Fushan County, was originally appointed by the provincial government, but was driven out by Liu's army some time ago. Now that Liu's army has withdrawn from Fushan, Zhu has returned to office. Ma Ming'e, the magistrate of Zhaoyuan County, was also appointed by the provincial government and was driven out by Liu's army yesterday. Wen Dekai was appointed to succeed him, but Wen fled that night, and Ma returned to office. Qian Qiu, the magistrate of Pingdu County, was originally appointed by the provincial government and has not been replaced. As for the remaining eight counties, all the county magistrates appointed by Liu have been removed and others have been sent to handle the aftermath. Sun Huashan, the magistrate of Laiyang County, has been removed, and Yang Yougui has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. Lang Weide, the magistrate of Huangxian County, has been removed, and Fan Mulu has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. Liu Yingcai, the magistrate of Penglai County, has been removed, and Cao Changchun has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. Zhao Fuchen, the magistrate of Haiyang County, has been removed, and Fan Lianying has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. Jia Xiyu, the magistrate of Wendeng County, has been removed, and Zhang Liyuan has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. Li Guanglin, the magistrate of Muping County, has been removed, and Song Xianzhang has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. Liu Baodi, the magistrate of Qixia County, has been removed, and Yu Baodong has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. Xia Jingru, the magistrate of Rongcheng County, has been removed, and Chen Deheng has been temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. The Jiaodong authority has now been largely unified.

<p>English Translation: Hankou Correspondence: After Xu Yuanquan supervised the suppression of the Red Bandits in Honghu, they were subjected to artillery fire from the outside and lacked food and ammunition from the inside. Many of the coerced people took the opportunity to surrender to the National Army and turned against them, and the internal structure collapsed day by day, and they lost their combat effectiveness. Therefore, wherever the National Army went, it was victorious. Recently, Chairman Chiang ordered that the remaining bandits in that area be suppressed by the 26th of this month in order to start clearing the countryside and handling the aftermath. After Xu Yuanquan received the order, he immediately instructed Zhang Xinghan, Xu Jiwu, Liu Peixu, and other troops to bravely search and suppress the bandits. Xu also personally went to Xindi to command. When the bandit leaders He and Duan fled north, they only led a small number of remnant bandits to escape in a hurry at night. Duan's family members were still left in the lake. A few days ago, Zhang Zhenhan's division entered the lake to search and suppress the bandits, and completely captured Duan's wife and daughter, uncle, sister Wu Xian, brother-in-law Long Rong, the puppet governor of Hubei Province Ma Wu, and Wu Qingcheng, the puppet director of the Hubei Department of Finance. Yao Bingyan, the puppet guard regiment leader and guerrilla commander, was killed on the spot, and his head was displayed to the public. The remaining bandits surrendered or fled. The bandit nest in Honghu has now been suppressed. Xu Yuanquan returned to Hankou from Xindi on the evening of the 26th to report everything. I visited Xu on the 28th. According to him, the aftermath in Honghu is now being handled by local gentry, with the support of Zhu Huaibing, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and others. Xu Jiwu's brigade was also dispatched to garrison the area to assist in clearing the countryside, and the lake was renamed Yong'an Lake. At the same time, it was suggested to set up a Water Public Security Bureau to patrol the lake at any time, so that the remnant bandits would never have a chance to make a comeback. This matter has been agreed upon with Director Zhu. In order to save expenses, Tao Jikan, the director of the Water Public Security Bureau, will be responsible for planning for the time being. The armored speedboat used by the 10th Army to suppress bandits will also be handed over to the bureau for command. Now the banks of Honghu and Xiang River have been cleared of bandits. Although there are still a few remnant bandits in western Hubei, they can be annihilated soon. Xu went to the General Headquarters and the Pacification Office that day, and visited Cao Haosen, Zhu Shaoliang, He Chengjun, and others. He will go to Yuekou again within a few days to preside over the aftermath. Tao Jikan, the director of the Water Public Security Bureau, has also repeatedly received telegrams from Zhu Huaibing, planning the establishment of the bureau in Honghu, and is scheduled to go there on the 29th.</p>

Fearing that many bandits are still being coerced and are wavering, it issued a special order yesterday to inform the bandits that all those who surrender before the Double Tenth Festival of this year will still be treated favorably. If they do not surrender after the deadline, they will be killed without mercy if they are captured thereafter (September 28th).</p>

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Nineteenth Route Army Requests the Arrest of the Traitor Hu Lifu: Since Hu Lifu was arrested in Shanghai and handed over to the Military Law Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry stated that Hu was not a soldier, and the Ministry of Justice was instructed to order the Higher Court here to handle the case. The court has already welcomed him to Suzhou and temporarily detained him in the Third Branch Prison. Chief Prosecutor Zhu of the High Prosecutor's Office has investigated the case. It is reported that the Nineteenth Route Army believes that Hu colluded with the Japanese army during the war in Shanghai and sabotaged the work of resisting the enemy. Therefore, yesterday (29th), it sent a letter to the High Court requesting that Hu be transferred to the headquarters of the Nineteenth Route Army for trial in accordance with military law. The High Prosecutor's Office is considering the letter after receiving it.</p>
<p>Robbery and Injury in Guoxiang: At about 2:00 AM on the 29th, a bandit ship suddenly arrived at the Luxiang Bridge area, about seven miles southwest of Guoxiang in the county. About eight or nine bandits landed and broke into the home of Fei Jinggao, a villager, to rob him. They beat and injured Fei's mother, Gao, and his daughter, Dabao. Then, they escaped into Taihu Lake.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Officials and Merchants Dispute the Quota of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax: The tobacco and alcohol license tax in Jiangsu Province caused a dispute between the ministry and the province in July. Later, it was decided that it would still be handled by the ministry, and the directors of the collection bureaus in each county were also appointed in August to set up bureaus in each county to collect taxes and report them on a monthly basis. The license tax quota in Wuxi is 39,875 yuan per year, an increase of only five yuan compared to last year. Chen Henian, a local, was appointed as the director by the General Bureau and set up a bureau on Wanqian Road to collect taxes. Unfortunately, after the poor harvest, the silk factories also failed, and two or three hundred tobacco and paper shops closed down. Therefore, the license tax was also reduced. According to calculations, the tax revenue is far from the quota. Therefore, Director Chen has repeatedly consulted with tobacco and alcohol merchants to moderately increase the amount or reorganize the grades to increase tax revenue. However, the tobacco and alcohol merchants, also unable to bear the burden, jointly sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, asking them to forward a letter to the Tax Bureau to reduce the tax amount. However, the Bureau stated that no matter what, the quota must be fully collected, while the tobacco and alcohol merchants firmly opposed it. The officials and merchants were unable to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>A County-Wide Anti-Bandit General Search: The joint defense conference of nine counties, including Xishan, Wujiang, Kunshan, and Qingpu, decided this time to conduct a general search simultaneously in each county at 6:00 AM on the 28th to eliminate bandits. The Director of the Joint Defense Zone, Zou Jing, the magistrate of Wu County, sent a letter to nine counties to inform them. Magistrate Chen of this county approved the letter and immediately secretly ordered all land and water public security agencies in the county to dispatch all personnel for a general mobilization. After receiving the order, Director Wu of the County Public Security Bureau and Wang Wei, the captain of the County Police Brigade, secretly ordered their supervisors to convene a meeting of patrol chiefs to discuss search methods and district defense arrangements. It was stipulated that all vessels traveling on the waterway, regardless of heavy or light boats, should be searched.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob and Shoot People: The Jiaoxi ferry boat from Wujin County was sailing from the countryside to the city the night before. When it reached the Yongding Bridge area, five or six bandits suddenly emerged from the mulberry fields on the north bank, holding pistols and broadswords, and ordered the boat to stop. They searched everywhere and only left with the loot after an hour. After the incident, it was inspected that a total of more than two hundred yuan of goods were lost, and the value of the remaining goods was considerable. Boatman Zhang Shunlin has reported the case to the nearby Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which forwarded it to the General Bureau on the 28th to request an arrest. In addition, Yao Ronglin's home in Huayuandi outside the East Gate was robbed late at night on the 27th, with little loss. However, Ronglin was shot by a bandit, hitting a vital part. He was taken to the hospital for treatment on the 28th, and there is a danger to his life.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Restricting Remittance of Funds to Reorganize Arrears: Nantong's annual remittance of taxes to the province is only more than 120,000 yuan, but the payment order issued by the Finance Department is more than 200,000 yuan. The Finance Bureau has submitted an application to the province, stating that the local government has already misappropriated a lot of funds and urgently needs to reorganize and repay them. Before the repayment, the monthly remittance is limited to 3,100 yuan, and the remaining tax revenue will be used to repay the debt.</p>
<p>Each Place Defends Against Fleeing Coastal Bandits: The Nantong County Police Department learned that a large group of coastal bandits had fled south from Haizhou and planned to disturb the counties of Tongzhou, Rugao, Haizhou, and Qidong. All coastal areas were put on alert on the 28th, and police teams were dispatched to the ports to defend against them. The county government also telegraphed the provincial security maritime guerrilla team stationed in Lusi to intercept and suppress them.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Four County Magistrates Are Still in Detention: The county magistrates who have been detained by the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province include Peng Guoyan of Pi County, Hong Fuyuan of Funing, Hua Zhen of Xinghua, and Yang Wei of Tongshan. The district chiefs of the Water Public Security Team include Jiang Chaoxiong of the Fourth District and Cheng Zhuang of the Fifth District. The presidents of the three counties of Peng, Hong, and Hua have been interrogated several times by Provincial Chairman Gu and Department Chief Zhao of the Civil Affairs Department, together with the plaintiffs and related parties in each case. Now all the plaintiffs have returned to their hometowns. Yang Wei has not been interrogated since being placed under guard. The two district chiefs, Jiang and Cheng, have also not been interrogated. Peng Guoyan is physically weak and has a history of hemoptysis. He had a rash last week, and his diet was poor. He has now recovered. Hua Zhen asked the guards in custody to purchase Buddhist scriptures and sits silently reciting them every day, which is very calm. Hong Fuyuan suffered great stimulation and became mentally ill after jumping into a well in the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital. It is said that Yang Wei is not prohibited from meeting foreign guests while in custody, but he is also very depressed.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Investigation of Field Tax Continues: The turmoil of the field tax investigation in the Second District of this county has temporarily subsided. It is reported that County Magistrate Yang must continue to carry out the investigation work in accordance with the order. Yesterday, he specially hired Dai Tianqiu, Gong Yaoshi, and Shi Jun as members of the field tax investigation committee to assist, and it was decided to convene a meeting of the members on October 1st, with the district chiefs of each district attending. It is said that it will discuss all appropriate policies.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Half of the House Tax is Allowed to Be Retained for Local Application: During the Songhu War this spring, large armies gathered in this county and excavated various fortifications and entertained the army, costing a total of more than 160,000 yuan. At that time, due to the urgency of the application, it was not approved by the provincial government. The Finance Bureau Director Wang Shengkao was responsible for borrowing from the county Chamber of Commerce and various banks to maintain the critical situation. So far, several months have passed, and this loan has not been repaid. Therefore, the local government has proposed to retain two months of the current house rent fee collected by the Finance Department to make up for the previous deficit. Unexpectedly, after submitting it to the provincial government, the instructions received stated that this special house rent fund had already been designated for use, and therefore the rejection was not approved. However, the previous military loans here were all the responsibility of the Finance Bureau Director Wang. Seeing that the provincial government rejected it in this way, he was very worried and intended to resign. Now, after the request of local gentry and various public groups, with additional explanations, it was allowed to allocate half of the house rent levy for local use. For example, if 40,000 yuan is levied, 20,000 yuan will be retained for county application. As for the number of remaining losses, it is planned to be allocated from the busy canal project this year. This order arrived in the county on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Transportation is About to Be Completed: The Hangzhou-Jiangshan railway route starts from Hangzhou to Jiangshan. After the completion of the section from Jiangshan to Yushan, transportation to Jiangxi Province can be achieved. Yushan is a prosperous commercial area, and there are many coal mines nearby, so this road is very important for the development of industry in Jiangxi Province. The Jin-Yu section is 155 kilometers long and is currently being actively prepared for construction, and it will soon reach the border of Jiangxi. The section in Jiangxi is about 16 kilometers long, and Zhejiang Province will continue to build it to connect it and achieve speed. Yesterday, the provincial government sent a letter to the Jiangxi Provincial Government to facilitate the early completion of the entire project.</p>
<p>Drug Trafficking Sentenced to Ten Years: Fu Shaozhi, a resident of Chenghuang Archway in Hangzhou, transported powdered raw materials for making red pills to the Shangjiang area for sale. He was searched by the inspection police at the Jianggan Wharf while he was boarding the ship and found a large number of bags of powdered drugs. The personnel and evidence were sent to the court. After the court investigated and confirmed that it was true, he was prosecuted in accordance with Article 5 of the Zhejiang Department of Justice's Drug Regulations. Yesterday, the verdict was announced that Fu Shaozhi was sentenced to ten years in prison for the crime of trafficking and manufacturing powdered red pill drugs.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Two Ships Collide, One Person Drowns: At 12:00 PM on the 27th, a Xiaoshan-Zhuji boat and a Shaoxing-Zhuji general merchandise boat collided at Sanjiangkou. Cracks were found in the hull of the boat, and water immediately entered the cabins of both ships, sinking into the heart of the river. More than 20 passengers on the sailing boat were fortunately unharmed and were rescued by neighboring boats and transferred to other boats. The cloth, rice bags, paper, woodenware, etc. loaded on the general merchandise boat were all sunk, with losses of more than a thousand yuan. In addition, the twelve-year-old son of the boatman drowned.</p>
<p>The Price of Cotton in the East Township Falls: The cotton produced in Xiaoshan East Township has always been on par with Shangyu and Yao counties. Today, the harvest is poor due to the water season, and the price is not high. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, there are limited purchases from outside, and the price has fallen from 15 yuan to 11 yuan per bale.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>The County Government Orders the Catholic Church to Demolish Houses: The Yinzhou County Government stated that the Jiangbei Fentan area is the most prosperous area in the city, but the roads there are narrow and need to be widened. Construction began last year, and the road surface project has already started. However, the houses of the Catholic Church have been repeatedly urged to be demolished but have not been demolished. It is learned that the county government yesterday sent another letter to the Catholic Church, ordering it to be demolished by the end of this month, otherwise, personnel will be sent to cooperate with the Ningbo Public Security Bureau to enforce it.</p>

<p>(4) Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>Now let me explain this system diagram. First, let's talk about primary education. The schools in this stage are collectively called elementary schools. The time limit should be six years, but in order to take into account China's economic situation and to promote popularization as soon as possible, some elementary schools may graduate in four years. Elementary schools only include two types of education: national education and production education. In terms of national education, we should try to make use of these four or six years to enable children to have the common sense necessary for modern citizens. The Three Principles of the People is the framework for China's nation-building. Children must have a very clear understanding of it. The level of Chinese language should be such that they can read ordinary books and newspapers and write simple letters and texts. They should know the outline of the history and geography of their own country and the history and geography of the world. The great achievements of the Chinese nation in the past should be deeply imprinted in the minds of children in order to arouse their love for the country and the nation. They should have a preliminary knowledge of teaching, hygiene, and natural science, and be able to apply it. On the one hand, children should understand the dangers facing the country and the nation, and the responsibilities that individuals bear to the country and society. On the other hand, they should train children's ability to live in groups. Only by achieving these levels can students graduating from elementary school be worthy of being healthy citizens, and can elementary school education be worthy of being called national education.</p>
<p>The standards of national education should be stipulated and promulgated by the central government throughout the country. Regardless of whether the elementary school is located in Jilin or Guangzhou, Shandong, or Qinghai, and regardless of whether the elementary school is provincial, county, or private, the content of the teaching may be different, but the standards must be the same. Those who have received four years of elementary school education must reach a certain level, and those who have received six years of elementary school education must reach a certain level. Schools that cannot achieve this level should be urged by the government to improve or be banned. Production education is different. Production education should vary from person to person and from place to place. Elementary schools located in rural areas, where students are the children of farmers and their environment is agricultural, should teach students the knowledge and skills of agricultural production. Elementary schools located in cities, where students are the children of merchants and workers and their environment is industrial and commercial, should teach students the knowledge and skills of industrial and commercial production. By analogy, elementary schools on the coast or by the river can teach students how to catch aquatic products, elementary schools in papermaking areas can teach students how to make paper, and elementary schools in porcelain areas can teach students how to make porcelain. In short, each adapts to the appropriate environment and does not become empty talk. This type of education is the most lacking in elementary schools today. Elementary schools today often make the children of farmers unable to farm and the children of workers unable to work. Elementary schools in the future should enable the children of farmers to farm better after receiving elementary school education, and the children of workers to work more precisely after receiving elementary school education. This is true production education.</p>
<p>Some people may say that elementary school children are very young and how much production skills can they teach them? I say that it is of course impossible to teach elementary school students specialized production skills, but it is definitely possible to make them a productive member of society after leaving school. There are many children in China who do not know a single word and have never attended school for a day, but are already engaged in production. For example, children of eight or nine years old in rural areas often help their fathers and brothers with weeding, pulling grass, and chopping firewood. In our area, the task of herding cattle by farm families is almost entirely entrusted to children. Children around the age of ten working in factories in cities are also commonly seen. Although these children may be helping their families or not receiving compensation or receiving meager wages, we cannot deny that they are productive members. Therefore, if rural elementary schools teach these elementary school students agricultural knowledge, such as how to select seeds, how to prevent droughts and floods, how to feed livestock, not only is it taught in books, but also practiced in the field, then wouldn't their production capacity increase after graduating in four or six years? If elementary schools in cities teach elementary school students industrial or commercial knowledge, such as how to manage machines, how to use them, how to record accounts, how to entertain customers, not only is it taught in books, but also practiced in the field, then wouldn't these elementary school students become better workers when they go to factories after graduating in four or six years? (Note that I do not approve of child labor, but under the current economic conditions in China, the only way to completely prohibit child labor is for the government to limit working hours and provide special protection.) Wouldn't they become better apprentices when they go to stores? I also advocate that elementary school children, regardless of their family's wealth or poverty, should be taught production skills whether they need to make a living after graduating or not. Because those who need to make a living after graduating will benefit immediately, and even those who are wealthy and can enter middle school or university can learn about the hardships of farming and the value of labor through production training, which will have many impacts on social reform.</p>

<h3>Peking University Students on Strike Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Peking Elementary School Teachers and Staff Telegraph the Ministry of Education to Demand Payment of Arrears</p>
<p>Beijing, September 29 (Electric Dispatch): The Beijing Elementary School Teachers and Staff Congress today decided to telegraph the Ministry of Education to demand payment of arrears, and to send representatives to the Peking Political Committee for negotiation.

<p>Beijing, September 29 (Electric Dispatch): Meng Lin went to Xishan today. Before leaving, he told reporters that the Peking University turmoil was instigated by a few people, and the central government is determined to rectify the university. When I was in Beijing, Minister Zhu once indicated this intention to me. Because of the lack of discipline, I asked the Ministry of Education to dismiss me. Before the new president appointed by the Ministry of Education arrives, I will temporarily be responsible for the duties of the president, but I will not go to the school to work. Routine matters will be handled by the secretary, and important matters will be resolved by the school affairs meeting.</p>

When Jiang Menglin was Minister of Education, he repeatedly invited experts to meetings to draft curriculum standards for various subjects, which were circulated for trial implementation and to collect experiences and opinions from practitioners in order to revise them for full application. The current Minister of Education, Zhu, also believes that this matter is of great importance and that detailed discussions are necessary. He had previously hired specialists as members of the history curriculum review committee. The appointed committee members, Su Yishan, Shen Gangbo, He Bingsong, Xu Ziming, Zhou Yutong, etc., held a discussion meeting at the Ministry of Education starting last Saturday (the 24th). Formal meetings began on the 26th, chaired by Shen Gangbo. On the 27th and 28th, meetings continued both morning and afternoon. In addition to the discussion of the goals and outlines of the history curriculum and teaching methods to be held on the 29th, the rest has been reviewed.

<h3>Jinan University Alumni Association's Letter to All Sectors on Behalf of the Alma Mater</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Jinan University Alumni Association has always strived to maintain its alma mater. Recently, its alma mater has taken advantage of the post-war period to improve itself, actively rectify the academic style, and strive to make the university academic and disciplined. Therefore, it has issued a letter to all sectors and the alma mater's alumni to draw social attention and encourage alumni. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>In this period of national crisis, the country is suffering from aggression and oppression. The Northeast has been lost, and Rehe is in danger. Is the fundamental way to save the country through academics? Jinan University, the alma mater, is the center of overseas Chinese education. It bears the mission of an ordinary university and the ambition to develop overseas Chinese affairs. Overseas Chinese students who have returned from overseas and students who aspire to develop abroad are given special training to cultivate special talents, enrich their intelligence, and increase their skills to meet the needs of society and seek the interests of overseas Chinese. The importance of its position is self-evident. When the Battle of Shanghai broke out, the school buildings were lost in the war zone, the school equipment was empty, and the students were scattered. Our President Zheng, mindful of the difficulty of creation and the importance of the mission of the school, even in the midst of shock and doubt, still painstakingly sought ways to provide relief. Classes were opened in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Guangdong, giving more than a thousand students a place to belong. At the same time, he felt sorry for the students of other schools in the war zone and could not bear to see them displaced, so he generously accepted them and treated them equally. He ran around, north and south, showing a kind of steadfast and loving ambition and a spirit of enthusiastic education. It is clearly known and should be seen by the world. When the original school in Zhenru was recovered, a post-war reorganization committee was organized to repair the dilapidated school buildings. In a few months, they were completely renovated. New equipment was added, and a power plant and printing press were built. The equipment was more complete than before. All the reorganization and purchase expenses were only more than 80,000 yuan. The planning was thoughtful, and the spirit was radiant. Most of the professors are well-known figures, and the staff are also capable. The finances are open, and the spending is thrifty. With this good phenomenon, the school's business is expected to flourish. However, President Zheng has made the greatest determination to take advantage of this opportunity to innovate and pay special attention to rectifying the academic style. All the strictness of the recruitment of new students this semester, the trial reading and borrowing students were sent away because the quota was full, and a few bad elements were expelled. It is not easy to be understood by those people. Therefore, they hold private grudges and conspire to slander, falsely issue declarations, and wantonly slander, in order to destroy our overseas Chinese institution, follow in the footsteps of Labor University, and take pleasure in their own selfishness and reverse black and white. The wickedness of their intentions and the absurdity of their words are painful to say, and the hair stands on end when heard. We deeply hope that all sectors will consider the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for their motherland and the importance of overseas Chinese education, and not be blinded by troublemakers, and allow them to confuse the public. Then the overseas Chinese are fortunate, and the country is fortunate. Our students in the school should know that the school is the family of the students, school discipline is the personality of the students, the status of the school is the status of the students, and the honor of the school is the honor of the students. Thinking of the country's difficulties, being able to participate in the school, and the singing not ceasing after the disaster, we should be steadfast and diligent, and concentrate on the exploration of academics, self-examine our conduct, and not believe in rumors, in order to create a good school spirit and seek practical knowledge in the shaky, difficult, and difficult situation, for ourselves, for the school, for the society, for the country, for the world... open a way out to save ourselves, save the school, save the society, save the country, save the world... then we are beyond the utmost prayer.</p>

<h3>New Basketball Techniques (4)</h3>
<p>(Not to be reproduced) Original by Claire Burcky</p>
<p>Translated jointly by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>The center jump in basketball is the same principle as the center kick-off in football, but the movements are different. The kick-off in football is the exclusive property of one team, while basketball maintains equilibrium. Now, several famous coaches, such as Dr. Meanwell of Wisconsin and Sam Barry of Southern California, advocate adopting other ways of kick-off. Barry advocates that the winning team of the coin toss throws the ball in from out of bounds, as if throwing out a boundary ball. After that, the scoring team throws the boundary ball at the start of each ball. Generally, the center jump method is used at the beginning of the second half or each quarter of a four-quarter game, after each team's shot is successful, after the completion of the free throw for one or more technical fouls, and after the completion of the double foul of the aggressor.</p>

<h3>The So-Called Tribute A Comedic Scene</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>Quotations from Old Man Ma Xiangbo at Ninety-Three</p>
<p>After the recent National Crisis Memorial Day, Old Man Xiang said this: "Now everyone is saying the same thing, about national crisis and national humiliation; I don't want to repeat what others say, but I'll talk about the comedies I personally heard and saw, about how the outer vassals used to come to pay tribute! The so-called 'tribute' brought China little benefit; it was actually a losing proposition! That renowned calligrapher, He Shaoji, who served as the imperial envoy to Goryeo, wrote a very neat font book in the style of Yan Zhenqing! I am very familiar with this incident.</p>
<p>In the past, the resident ministers in Tibet were mostly Manchus; it was not until the end of the Qing Dynasty that there were Han ministers. It is said that it snows and rains there in June, and the sheepskins are very good: they had to be taken as tribute.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is that the people who came to pay tribute would perform martial arts along the way to raise money to cover their expenses! Once, I heard that Siam was coming to pay tribute with elephants. When they reached a place with a large river, the tribute bearers would ask the local officials and people to gather 180,000 coins to build a bridge, insisting that the elephants could not cross the river, delaying the important matter of paying tribute to the heavenly court; the local authorities could not bear such a great charge: so they sent a batch of money to the tribute bearers, and the bridge did not need to be built; they led the elephants to swim across the river; in fact, in India and other tropical places, elephants swimming across the river is nothing special, they are already used to it! Each time, the tribute bearers received very rich gifts on their return.</p>
<p>In the past, our country treated its vassal states in this way! We did not want each other to come and go often; we even forbade the vassal states to come and go with each other: there were bans on entering and exiting! It was enough if each could maintain a peaceful and stable situation!</p>
<p>How could it be like that smiling tiger who encouraged Goryeo to become independent and then swallowed it up himself?"</p>
<h3>The Three Different Eras of Everyone</h3>
<p>— Xi Niao</p>
<p>丨Prelude to Sorrow丨</p>
<p>The era is treading on the wheels of progress, step by step seeming to develop its proud history. The sound of autumn has risen. I quietly opened the shadows of everyone who has fallen in this era, unable to withstand the attacks of the gusts of autumn wind, which shattered my weak heart in this way, wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>The result of disillusionment made me even more unable to forget the dark shadows of the three different eras of everyone, from the past, present, and looking forward to the future, feeling a kind of bitter terror!</p>
<p>Our Country</p>
<p>(Past) We all heard the voices of revolution and saving the country.</p>
<p>(Present) The three northeastern provinces were lost under non-resistance.</p>
<p>(Future) According to a certain important person: "If China perishes at the hands of the National Government, it is a truly painful thing." Ah! Are we going to perish? · · · · · · · · ·</p>
<p>Our Education</p>
<p>(Past) When the intelligence of the students was not as good as the expectations of the teachers, the teachers had to punish the students by hitting their palms and making them stand in the corner.</p>
<p>(Present) When the actions of the teachers were not as good as the wishes of the students, the students had to invite the teachers to live and get out, etc.</p>
<p>(Future) The teachers all change their careers and dare not do blackboard work. The students hold their heads high and may even elect their own principals and teachers, etc. · · · · · · · · ·</p>
<p>Our Youth</p>
<p>(Past) Receiving family instruction, reading dead books, and carrying on the family business is the best model.</p>
<p>(Present) Opposing stubborn families, supporting free love, and dancing in Western clothes is the most beautiful life.</p>
<p>(Future) Overthrowing old and decaying parents, carrying out family revolution, the rich indulging in Westernized entertainment to enjoy the happiness of youth, the penniless studying fraud and abduction, not engaging in honest work · · · · · · · · ·</p>
<p>Writing these with tears in my eyes, I can't write any more!</p>
<h3>Western-Style Funeral</h3>
<p>— Yun Qi</p>
<p>丨A Scene at the International Funeral Home丨</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where life is scientific, everything is under the control of science. In the interior, burying a coffin requires occupying a certain amount of land. If it is buried in a disorderly manner, others will regard it as a burial mound: the wealthy, who own millions of dollars, often occupy as much as ten acres of land for one grave! The impact of land after thousands of years is truly alarming when calculated! The city is different, with public cemeteries, occupying only one hole, how economical? Speaking of funeral arrangements, there is the International Funeral Home. I have lived in Shanghai for ten years. What kind of International Funeral Home is it? I am ashamed to say that I have never looked at it. At the beginning of the month, a friend of mine died of lung disease in Shanghai and was embalmed at the International Funeral Home. The hall has a hall where sacrifices can be made, and a hearse to transport the dead to the hall. It is said that a consul from a certain country, waiting for the family members to encoffin, after a month, the corpse looked as if alive; the operations such as washing the body were all handled by the people in the hall, who were as close as flesh and blood, and could not be consulted. Those who came to pay their respects were prevented from speaking loudly, and the family members were not allowed to cry! Foreign funerals pay attention to a "quiet" word, which coincides with our great Chinese saying of "swallowing one's voice and weeping"; the funerary clothes are put on well, and placed on a bed, so that family members and relatives can have a last look, regardless of men, women, old or young, all are made up, the corpse is laid out on the bed, as if sleeping; several young women are also painted with powder and rouge. If they are placed in an exquisite bedroom, it is a very good picture of beauties slumbering; the style of the coffin is also different from the bulky Chinese ones, shaped like a long box. The corpse has undergone scientific surgery, and there is no need for things like lime. If there are many children, they can carry it to the hearse without much effort, which is just the weight of a normal person plus a box. Then, even if it is a long journey to attend the funeral, they can calmly witness the encoffining.</p>
<h3>Can Shame Be Overthrown?</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>丨 The Result is Increased Sin 丨</p>
<p>The slogan "Overthrow shame" is also a new product of this 20th century. Modern young men and women often express it, indicating that "they" are standing at the forefront of fashion.</p>
<p>The wheels of time are constantly moving forward, getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new, which is of course not an easy process. However, in our country, where the old morality has been overthrown and the new morality has not yet emerged, although I am not a moralist, I dare to ask: Is this "overthrowing shame" applicable to our country recently?</p>
<p>In today's society, countless shameless acts are constantly being staged, especially in this prosperous Shanghai. Things like bestiality, incestuous performances (special plays), and other crimes such as theft and kidnapping, the word "shame" should have been eliminated in their minds. Now that someone is advocating "overthrowing shame," it makes them fully agree. From now on, the most shameless things can be done to the end! I remember a witty and satirical couplet that Peng Gangzhi gave to a certain wealthy household, which contained the four characters (forgetting eight, shameless). Originally, a certain wealthy household became rich by despicable means. The couplet said: "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, loyalty, filial piety, integrity, righteousness, propriety, and shame." Look how happily he cursed!</p>
<p>Literary News: Famous novelist Mr. Xu Zheshen. He was as famous as Kai Xu Wosheng when he was young. He has been in Shanghai's literary scene for 30 years. He has published no less than one hundred and several dozen books of literature and fiction. Recently, the number of students from other provinces and cities joining the novel correspondence school he founded has reached as many as five or six hundred. The original school site was not sufficient, so it was moved to 50 Shencheng Lane, Rue Amiral de Hameilin, French Concession on the first of this month.</p>
<h3>By the Lakeside</h3>
<p>— Wang Fang'an</p>
<p>丨 It is precisely on the day when the rivers and mountains are broken that I secretly hear about excursions. 丨</p>
<p>It was the autumn scenery of the lake and sky eight years ago. I seem to remember that I and Mengyu were on our way home in the wind and rain. At that time, we were in a small boat. Indeed, "the mountains are drowsy and the water is gentle!" Such scenery, no matter how poets and painters praise it endlessly, cannot describe it all. However, the rain and wind still hit us. The small West Lake could not withstand the violent wind and rain, and almost stirred up monstrous waves. Our leisure and elegance disappeared without a trace. This was the first time Mengyu and I met after admiring each other from afar. We already had the concept of sharing weal and woe. Although the matter was ordinary, empty, and simple, the impression it gave us was very deep. Even if I am forgetful, it has not become blurred at all.</p>
<p>In recent years, old friends have become estranged, and most of them seem to drift east and west like duckweed, without a home. Mengyu! I am too lazy to even write to him. It has been four or five years. Like me, who seems to have a home but cannot return, I recently wandered to the shores of West Lake and rearranged the pens and inkstones that had been abandoned, forced to do work that I didn't want to do.</p>
<p>The "September 18th Incident" death knell is striking my heart. Memorial texts stained with blood and tears are spread all over my desk. Although my work seems very tense, my nerves are almost completely disordered. Late one night, Mengyu, Madam Juanhong, and Qier came to the West Lake from Shanghai, which was under the iron heel of imperialism. So, we gathered together again like duckweed! The next morning, I took Fang and my son Tieru to the third floor of the West Lake Hotel to meet Mengyu and the others. Mengyu! He is a friend full of passion, but here, he actually brought his wife and daughter to Hangzhou to watch the tide during this national crisis. Has his blood turned cold? Why? I was very surprised when he opened his mouth and asked me to be a guide for him and asked me to go to Jianggan to watch the tide.</p>
<p>However, Mengyu's words made me both laugh and cry. He said:</p>
<p>"Friend! Are you surprised? I have my reasons. The reason is... On the anniversary of this national crisis, I really can't stand Shanghai, which is full of the smell of foreigners. I desperately want to find a piece of clean land to relax some of my accumulated depression and breathe a breath of fresh air! So, I thought of West Lake, I thought of this clean West Lake, I thought of the magnificent tide, I thought of Wu Zixu's loyalty to the emperor and love for his country, I thought of King Qian Musu's feat of using three thousand iron crossbows to shoot the tide, I thought of Yue Fei, who was finally wronged to death for breaking the Hu captives but not drinking Huanglong, so I had such a motive, and by the way, I also came to verify the old dream of our lake and autumn trip eight years ago."</p>
<p>At this time, we started our journey.</p>
<p>On the first day, we went to Hupao, drank the unusually clear spring water, climbed the Liuhe Pagoda, looked at the Qiantang River without foreign warships, and finally admired the "tail of the tide" at the Jianggan Guan Hai Lou!</p>
<p>On the second day, we were swaying in a flat boat in the turbulent waves, went to the XX Villa, which had once dreamed of a girl with seventeen wonderful years, inspected the Duanyou Villa, which had changed hands, tasted the West Lake vinegar fish outside the building, and finally went to the Moon Old Man's seat in Baiyun Nunnery to ask for a few lottery slips, and hurriedly sent Mengyu, Madam Juanhong, and Qier to the train back to Shanghai, and separated again like duckweed.</p>
<p>Although it was only two short days, and it was also a day when the rivers and mountains were broken, my worries were washed away by the scenery of the lakes and mountains.</p>
<p>The autumn scenery of the lake and sky eight years ago is still exactly the same as today, only Mengyu and I are in middle age of sorrow and joy, and have more wrinkles on our foreheads. After we parted this time, with a bang, the Russo-Japanese War suddenly broke out, breaking the silent situation during the national crisis.</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower Spot Yarn Flower Removal Still Active</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still flat, the current yarn Guangdong gang's entry is still strong, but other gangs' actions are very few. However, American cotton is flat and tired, and people's hearts are soft. Futures yarn is suspended due to the end of the month handling of delivery procedures. According to most people's psychology in the market, the market is expected to fall, but each factory has less bottom goods, and they are deeply afraid that there will be no extremely large drop. The future situation is not dare to be predicted.</p>
<p>Current Yarn Opened at 500 Bales The current yarn removal is still not bad. It is estimated that the total amount of purchases by each gang throughout the day is 505 bales, and the market is similar to the previous day. The amount of purchases from each party is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 355 Zhenjiang 15 Inland 25</p>
<p>Shantou 105 Nanjing 5 Total 505 Bales</p>
<p>The Demand for Raw Cotton Mills is Not Thin The cotton market is flat. Because foreign cotton is trending down and the domestic climate is favorable, new cotton from all over the country has been listed, and people's hearts are flat. However, the demand from each factory is also not thin. The source is estimated to be 1,180 bales of Yao flower and 1,000 bales of Tongzhou flower. The current cotton sales record is American Flower 35.25 Yong'an Factory entered 200 pieces and sent it to the factory again.</p>

<h3>This Month's Yarn Delivery Volume is Not Large</h3>
<p>The September yarn bidding was in mid-May, about 155 taels. Later, due to the fall of American cotton to within 5 points, the actual demand was not smooth, and it fell to 138 taels and 5 mace. Rongxing turned from short to long. In mid-July, the Nanbu gangs purchased a large amount of processed yarn, about more than 80,000 bales. Therefore, it changed from a low peak to a high level. Later, on August 8, the American cotton government reported a decrease in production, and a soaring sound of more than 80 pounds, rising for a week. The highest spot price of American cotton was 9.2 cents, rising 420 pounds from the low time. At the same time, the rising trend of the bidding yarn became more acute, and the highest was 158 taels and 2 mace. However, as the market price increased, the actual demand became slow. Unexpectedly, the second American cotton estimate was released, suddenly rising 100 pounds. The firm and rising atmosphere was disrupted, and the buyer was like a bolt from the blue, greatly hit. The seller took advantage of the weakness to pursue, and the state of terror for a time was unstoppable, breaking into the 50 taels mark. The lowest was 148 taels and 7 mace, but Rongxing's intention to take delivery of more goods did not change, and it rebounded to 153 taels. The last plate was 151, and as a result, 2,200 bales were left. The delivery price was 151 taels, of which 500 bales were delivered by themselves, and 700 bales of 20-count Ren Zhong, 700 bales of Fugui, and 300 bales of Songhe were actually delivered.

The Shen gang recruited some activity, and the Dahua firm bought 250 bales of Demao Long with a two-week delivery and an opening price of 30 taels and 5 mace.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Selling with a Tendency to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to unfavorable weather. However, it subsequently weakened due to positive forecasts for the eastern region and reactive selling. Futures fell six to ten points, spot prices fell ten points, British cotton futures fell one to two points, spot prices rose two points, Egyptian cotton spot prices rose ten points, and the Indian cotton market remained stable. Flat good and Oomra rose 2.75 rupees, and White Broach rose 4.5 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated 28th).</p>

<h3>New Early Rice Spikes Fall by Three Cents</h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, approximately 17 or 18 ships arrived from various guilds. The number of people arriving at the market in the morning was not large. New early rice spikes arrived, and sales were slow, with prices falling by three cents. Early and late rice also followed with a slight decrease of one or two cents. Common Xichang northern粳 and Su Tong new粳 were unaffected. Around 600 to 700 piculs were traded on the Huangpu River throughout the day.</p>
<p>New Zha: The arrival of goods from inland areas is increasing daily, but transactions on this street are normal. Kunshan, Bacheng North, and other mid-grade goods are down two cents each, and new foreign early rice spikes are also down nearly one cent. Top-quality northern粳 has slightly increased. Stacking yards are opening, and meal deliveries are active, with prices increasing by five cents.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales are Very Stagnant</h3>
<p>Ningbo Guild Trying Out Hunan Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was quiet. Only 300 bags were traded by this street to meet market demands, with prices similar to yesterday. However, due to poor sales to local customers, the market situation is not good, and sellers are still determined to hold prices. Therefore, the market is becoming increasingly stagnant. Yesterday, small batches opened at 8.435 yuan. Saigon No. 1 was 9.5 yuan. Over the weekend, more local Xian rice arrived. New early rice spikes from Nanjing, Liuhe, and various areas north of the Yangtze River in Anhui Province also arrived in Shanghai in large quantities. Therefore, the Hunan suppliers who arrived in Shanghai a few days ago are being ignored, and future deals will be difficult. Yesterday, 40 bags of Hunan Yuan rice opened at 12.4 yuan, purchased by the Ningbo guild.</p>
<h3>Initial Stability and Subsequent Weakness in Flour and Wheat Market</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market showed initial stability followed by a decline in all months after opening in the morning and afternoon. Although foreign wheat prices were around one cent, people inside and outside the industry believe that mills will continue to order foreign wheat, and subsequent selling is inevitable. Moreover, with rice prices gradually easing, the flour market will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, initial stability was followed by a decline as mills were rumored to be selling off stock. The market weakened further, falling about one cent from the previous day's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was rumored that mills had continued to order a ship of No. 3 wheat at 3.75 taels, and market sentiment remained quiet. This month, due to inactivity from customers, it was rumored that Huafeng would deliver warehouse receipts, causing a significant drop in the market during the last three trades, falling straight down over 2 cents. As a result, this month fell 2.75 cents compared to the previous day, October fell 1.25 cents, November fell 1.75 cents, and December and January fell 1.5 cents, while February fell 2 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, wheat futures showed initial stability followed by a decline in all months after opening in the morning and afternoon. During the morning trades, market sentiment remained stable due to a slight increase of around one cent in foreign wheat prices. When the market opened in the afternoon, it weakened due to the poor performance of the flour market and the continued ordering of foreign wheat, rendering domestic wheat insignificant. Therefore, market sentiment became quiet, but trading was also exceptionally slow. As a result, October fell 2 cents compared to the previous day, November fell 2 cents, December fell 4 cents, January fell 3 cents, and February fell 4 cents. The spot wheat market has become calm. Trading was not brisk throughout the day. Only 340 bags of Zhenjiang wheat opened at 3.37 taels.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Slightly Up</h3>
<p>Xinhua Foreign Firm reports, Chicago wheat rose slightly on Wednesday, initially falling due to weakness in overseas markets, but subsequently strengthened due to opportunistic buying from the East. The number of transactions on the 27th totaled 20 million bushels. The closing prices for the 28th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September  52.625  Up 0.5</p>
<p>December 54.75  Up 0.375</p>
<p>May   59.74  Unchanged</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Shortage of Spot Raw Sugar and White Sugar</h3>
<p>| Sudden Increase of Two Cents |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market should have been stable due to a slight increase in the Dutch exchange rate and a decrease in the gold standard. However, there was a significant shortage of spot raw sugar and white sugar for the 24th. The goods arriving in April have already been sold out. The newly arrived goods were initially offered by the guild at 14.9 taels, but were later traded at 14.875 taels for several hundred bags, an increase of two cents compared to the previous day. Medium white sugar for the 20th was initially offered at 14.3 taels, then increased by 2.5 cents. Medium white sugar for the 18th was offered at 14 taels. Market sentiment is exceptionally firm and bullish, with potential for further increases. Crystal sugar from this factory opened at 16.56 taels for a small quantity, then quickly reported tightness and offered at 16.78 taels. Based on current trends, further increases are likely.</p>
<h3>Longkou Vermicelli Goods Scarce and Rebounding in Northern and Southern Markets</h3>
<p>| Next Batch Arriving Soon |</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli has been scarce recently. The previous market had reached 19 taels, but current inventory is low, and Fujian merchants have been doing well, requesting over 200 bags. Therefore, the selling price has risen to 19.32 cents. Yantai vermicelli is also scarce and selling at 17 taels. Northern Jiangsu vermicelli is at 11.5 taels. It is rumored that the next batch of Longkou vermicelli, consisting of 500 to 600 bags, will arrive in Shanghai in about four or five days.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Filature Silk Unmet Demand</h3>
<p>Price Opens at 130 Taels... Silk Merchants Still Have No Goods Available</p>
<p>Filature silk prices have soared as factories resume operations in England, America, and France. After new cocoons entered the market, the price of superior filature silk had fallen to 80 taels, but no one inquired. Since the beginning of last month, French exports have started, and English and American firms have successively begun purchasing, depleting almost all the remaining stock in the market. Currently, due to strong demand from European firms, there is a limited amount of stock, resulting in unmet demand. Yesterday, the price of superior filature silk opened at 130 taels, but silk merchants still have no goods available.</p>
<h3>Accumulators Suppress Prices, Accumulating White Filature Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firms' silk market still lacked progress. Overseas sales remained sluggish, and telegrams reported quiet conditions. European and American accumulators were thinking about accumulating white filature silk by suppressing prices and jointly invited various factories to discuss sending telegrams. The factories unanimously adopted a firm attitude due to the critical importance of silk, leading to a sluggish market.</p>
<h3>Tea Market's Downturn Continues</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms' tea trade was quiet. Although there were a few telegram transactions for Wuyuan East Zhenmei green tea by English and Indian firms, the selling price fell by another four or five taels. There were no transactions for Wuyuan North Zhenmei green tea throughout the city. Whether the market can be active depends on the arrival of European telegrams next week. The market situation for green tea on that route is the worst. Gongxi of the route firm, yesterday, the Help Association and Yingfa Ruichang and other firms still had a few purchases, but the merchants' bids were gradually tightening, and the Chinese merchants' ability to hold firm was weak, causing tea prices to fall again and again. Therefore, most of the local tea factories have stopped working and closed down.</p>
<h3>Metals: Brass Ingots Increase by More Than Three Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of brass ingots was 93 taels per picul, which was 3.5 taels higher than before. However, the underlying stock was extremely thin, and merchants from Sichuan and Hubei were buying everywhere, making the market very brisk. There is still a trend for standard brass ingots to continue to improve.</p>
<h3>Over 300 Barrels of Small Iron Nails Transacted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total number of small iron nail transactions reached more than 300 barrels. The buyers were mostly from the Yangtze River guild, and some from the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou guilds were also inquiring. In addition, guilds from Guangdong and Fujian were also purchasing, making the market more active than before. Although the price was not higher than before, it was more firm. Three-point nails were priced at 11.75 taels, four-point nails at 12.5 taels, five-point nails at 12 taels, and six-point nails at 11.8 taels.</p>

<h3>National Day During National Crisis</h3>
<p>Regarding the Suspension of Celebrations</p>

<p>The Defense Corps Conducts a Grand Review</p>
<p>This year's Double Tenth National Day, it is heard that the Central Government has ordered all national agencies to suspend celebrations due to the ongoing national crisis. However, the municipal government has not yet received this order and inquired with the Central Government yesterday to comply with it.</p>

The corps plans to hold a grand review at the Public Stadium on this year's Double Tenth National Day. It is heard that each district will send more than one team of members to attend and participate at that time.</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Claims to be in Shanghai for Medical Treatment and Has No Mission</p>
<p>Will Meet with Sun Ke Today</p>
<p>Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 yesterday morning by overnight train from Nanjing. Those who came to Shanghai on the same train included Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, Minister of Personnel Niu Yongjian, and Italian Minister Ciano. According to Lin, he came to Shanghai for medical treatment and has no special mission. It is heard that Lin will meet with Sun Ke today to exchange political views. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Exemplary Frugality: When Chairman Lin boarded the train the night before, he did not bring any followers and did not notify the railway bureau to hook up a car. He only temporarily bought a first-class sleeper ticket, so there were no farewell personnel at the Nanjing station. At the same time, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming and Italian Minister Ciano rode in a specially hooked-up decorated car. Mr. Zeng only learned that Chairman Lin had also come to Shanghai after getting off the train this morning, which shows Lin's frugality. When the train arrived at the North Station at 8:00 yesterday morning, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, personally led police officers and a military band to welcome him. Chairman Lin was still wearing a blue cloth gown and a black cloak, and slowly got off the train to the uplifting sounds of military music. He immediately took a car with the Director of the Postal Administration, Lin Shi, who came to welcome him, to rest at his residence on Rue Père Huc.</p>
<p>Lin's Speech: After arriving at his residence, Chairman Lin received reporters from various newspapers. According to Lin, he did not have any mission this time in Shanghai. His old illness has not fully recovered, so he came to Shanghai for continued medical treatment. There are no good doctors in Nanjing, and Shanghai doctors should not be delayed to Nanjing for my personal reasons and delay Shanghai patients. Therefore, I came to Shanghai for treatment and to prepare nutritional medicine for my return to Luoyang. That place not only has no good doctors, but also no good medicine. As for whether to go to Mogan Mountain to meet Mr. Wang recently, it has not yet been decided, but there is a thought. Regarding the dispute between Han Fuju and Liu Zhennian, each side has its own view, and it is difficult to know the truth. President Chiang has sent a strong person to monitor the military actions of both sides to avoid the expansion of the incident, and to investigate the cause of their dispute so that the Central Government can make a fair judgment. I intend to visit Mr. Sun Zhesheng tomorrow (that is, today), and so on.</p>
<p>Whereabouts of Sun Ke: After Wang went to Mogan Mountain and Sun Ke came to Shanghai, news about Sun becoming the president of the Executive Yuan resurfaced. Yesterday, reporters asked Chairman Lin about this, but Lin declined to comment and said he did not know. According to Sun Ke's associates, Sun's personal position, or whether he can cooperate with someone, is not a problem. The key lies in whether the government's views on foreign policy can be consistent and whether there is any way to handle the entire foreign policy. Otherwise, sacrificing oneself will not benefit the party and the country.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Telegraphically Replies to the National Salvation Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>Expressing Sympathy for Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>The National Salvation Organizations Joint Association of the Republic of China recently telegraphed northern generals to request that they send troops to suppress the rebels and resist Japan because Japan recognized the puppet state of Manchuria. Yesterday, it received a reply from Yan Xishan, Director of Pacification in Taiyuan, which read: Shanghai National Salvation Organizations Joint Association of the Republic of China, respectfully received the telegram. Foreign insults are increasingly urgent, and the national crisis is deepening. As a soldier, Xishan is duty-bound to wield a weapon and defend against insults. Your association's determination to save the country is urgent, and you call out, revealing the voice of China and unifying the will of the people. Xishan dares to share the same hatred and follow you all. Special telegram reply, please investigate. Yan Xishan.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Northeast National Salvation Army Beg for Assistance</h3>
<p>Liu Zongyao Returns North Today</p>
<p>Assistance in Shanghai Assigned to Substitute</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that representatives of the Fourth Route and Twenty-sixth Route of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army were ordered to come to Shanghai to ask for assistance, and have been busy contacting various parties. Yesterday, Mr. Liu Zongyao, representative of the Twenty-sixth Route, received a letter from Zhang Mingwu, commander of the route, summoning him to return north quickly to discuss important military matters. Mr. Liu decided to go north today (30th) with his staff. All assistance tasks in Shanghai that have not been completed will be temporarily handled by the representative of the Fourth Route. The representatives of the two routes have been working together since the 24th. It is also heard that the representatives have received a maintenance fee of 100 yuan from a certain important person. The letter to the Support Association is recorded below: Respectfully, the representatives were previously ordered to come to Shanghai and repeatedly requested your association to provide our army with appropriate assistance, as stated in the previous letter. I received a personal reply yesterday that it would be replied after the Standing Committee made a decision. Now your so-called Standing Committee has held two meetings, but there has been no reply so far, which is very surprising. In the autumn of national crisis, border guards rely on the support of the rear, and rescuers are like firefighters. Moreover, our army is responsible for the vanguard of the Tianjin-Beijing fortress, fighting bloody battles. In addition, the severe cold is approaching in the north, and tens of thousands of soldiers are looking forward, and they are sleepless day and night. Can you stand by and not ask? It is sad that our loyal comrades who serve the country are suffering from hunger and cold and become things in the ditches. Can the patriotic gentlemen of the country bear it? The representatives were ordered to come south to call for assistance. If we can get a satisfactory result, we must return north to report. The general attack of our army is imminent, and we long to return. We hereby extend our previous request, whether there is a solution, please reply quickly. Even if it is a grain of food, half a piece of cotton clothing, a shell casing, an inch of bandage, or a small package of medicine, the representatives will not think it is too little. It will also prove the enthusiasm and donation of your association's patriotic gentlemen, and it can comfort comrades who abandon their families, devote themselves, and die in the resistance against Japan. Alas, alas, my tears are flowing, and I can't bear to say any more. Urgently, respectfully, waiting for instructions, and sending a heavy letter in reply, hoping for a prompt reply. Respectfully addressed to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association,</p>
<h3>People from All Walks of Life Rise Up to Join the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army's operations are vigorous and continuous, and people from all over the country are coming to assist and participate. The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association has received many donations from other provinces and cities, and many people, including Zhang Fan and Shen Chichang, have requested guidance to go to the Northeast to participate in the fighting. Those who request to organize ambulance teams to engage in ambulance work include Wu Longhui and Yu Yunjie. The letter from Wu Longhui is recorded below: Respectfully, the report said that Mr. Yu Yunjie's letter to your association, proposing to actively organize a Northeast Volunteer Army ambulance team, is about serving the national crisis, and his heart is commendable. I hope that your association will initiate and carry it out quickly, and I also express my sympathy and am willing to join in the handling to fulfill my national duties. I previously served as a staff officer of the 8th Division of the Army at the Wuhan Military Officer Training Center, and now I am willing to serve in the Northeast, carrying out military and ambulance work.</p>

<h3>Pudong Telephone Problems</h3>
<p>Public Works Bureau Official Issues Statement</p>
<p>Telephone Company Has No Intention of Signing a New Agreement</p>
<p>The Bureau Has No Obligation to Issue Permits for Repairs</p>
<p>Yesterday, major Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai published an important notice from the Shanghai Telephone Company, stating that due to damage to the submarine cable, telephone service to and from Pudong was temporarily suspended. The company immediately went to the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau to request a permit for repairs, but the bureau refused to grant it, preventing the company from carrying out repairs and causing the telephone service to be interrupted. The outside world, unaware of the truth, cannot help but be suspicious. Reporters from various newspapers, recognizing the importance of this matter, inquired with the Public Works Bureau. According to an official from the bureau, the telephone company operating across the boundary into the Pudong area of the city and laying cables across the river is based on Article 4 of the communication contract signed between the former Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. This contract was signed on December 17th of the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925) for a term of five years. In August of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), the Shanghai Telephone Company acquired the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company, and this contract expired on December 16th of the same year. Since then, the Shanghai Telephone Company has had no legal basis for operating telephones in the Pudong area. However, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications had not yet completed its branch office in the Pudong area, and the residents there had a great need for telephones. To facilitate the residents, the bureau had to consider the actual situation and devise appropriate solutions. Therefore, the day after the expiration of the above-mentioned communication contract (i.e., December 17th of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930)), the Public Works Bureau invited the director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and responsible representatives of the Shanghai Telephone Company to the bureau for consultation, and verbally suggested signing a contract to include the Pudong telephone issue. It was hoped that this temporary contract could be concluded soon, granting the company a legal basis for operating telephones in Pudong, and allowing residents in the Pudong area to continue enjoying telephone convenience. Unexpectedly, after discussions began on May 22nd of last year, the company repeatedly went back and forth, causing numerous setbacks. After no less than twenty formal and informal meetings, the Public Works Bureau, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and the Shanghai Telephone Company jointly signed the draft contract on December 23rd of last year (see attached film). Even more unexpectedly, after the draft contract was signed, the company made excuses for delays and refused to sign the formal contract. The company's operation of telephones in the Pudong area was originally based on the above-mentioned communication contract. Now that the old contract has long expired, and the company has repeatedly gone back and forth, with no intention of signing a new agreement, it has no intention of obtaining a legal basis. Since it does not want to obtain a legal basis, the Public Works Bureau has no obligation to issue a permit to repair the cable. The Public Works Bureau is well aware of the inconvenience felt by Pudong telephone users due to the damaged cross-river cable, which prevents them from making calls, but is unable to help. Now the company is distorting the facts, quoting out of context, and claiming that the Public Works Bureau refused to issue a permit, preventing the company from carrying out repairs, as if the Public Works Bureau intentionally obstructed it, which could easily lead to serious misunderstandings among those who are unaware of the truth. This is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>Last Page of the Temporary Contract Draft Signed and Sealed by All Three Parties</p>
<p>The Word "Tin" at the End Was Signed by Zheng Tianxi, the Lawyer Witnessing the Event</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Actively Promotes Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Principle of Increasing Taxes on Artificial Silk Determined</p>
<p>Urging the Development of Domestic Goods Exhibition Halls</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry believes that the failure of natural silk in recent years has been greatly influenced by imported artificial silk. Previously, after consultation with the Ministry of Finance on a plan to rescue the silk industry, the principle of increasing import taxes on artificial silk was determined. It is heard that the plan has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry of Industry is currently consulting with the Ministry of Finance on the tax rate increase, which will be decided and announced soon. In addition, in order to promote domestic goods, the Ministry of Industry yesterday sent letters to various provinces and cities, urging them to hold domestic goods exhibitions immediately. It also noted that, apart from the thirteen domestic goods exhibition halls established in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, etc., the rest have not been established. The provincial and municipal governments that have not yet established them have been notified to urge their preparation. The Ministry also believes that the Beijing Domestic Goods Commercial Center is developing rapidly, and the commercial centers attached to the domestic goods exhibition halls in Shanghai, Hebei, Zhejiang, etc., should also be expanded in consideration of local conditions and to meet the needs. It has been decided to immediately send letters to various provinces and cities to expand existing ones and universally establish new ones.</p>

<h3>Frozen Fish Industry Opposes Re-imposition of Fish Tax</h3>
<p>Submitting a Request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Assistance</p>
<p>The recent rumors that the government will re-impose fish taxes have sparked opposition in the fishing industry. The Fresh Fish Industry Guild also submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Respectfully submitted: Recently, fish merchants from Ningbo, Taizhou, and other regions have been inquiring with our association, saying that they have heard rumors that there will be a re-imposition of fish taxes. The rumors are very specific, so they seem to have some basis. If this happens, the fishermen's only hope of survival will be completely destroyed. Please assist in appealing against this. Our association and the fish businesses have a close relationship, and we feel the pain deeply, so we are paying close attention to this matter. There are many rumors circulating, causing confusion. On March 28th of last year, the National Government ordered that, 'Our country's fishing industry is declining day by day. If we do not actively promote and protect it properly, it will not be enough to save it and revitalize it. Therefore, all fish taxes and fishing taxes are hereby exempted. In the future, no matter what organization, they shall not establish other items to collect this tax, in order to comply with the government's intention to eliminate cumbersome measures and protect the fishing industry, etc.' After receiving the order, the fishermen in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were moved to tears and said that there was hope. Unexpectedly, after only a year, there are rumors of the revival of the fish tax. Oh, our common people are running around telling each other, and they really don't know what to do. The National Government issued a clear order to save and revitalize the fishing industry, and exempted all fish taxes and fishing taxes. It also repeatedly emphasized that 'In the future, no matter what organization, they shall not establish other items to collect this tax.' Based on our common sense, we thought that we would be able to maintain this protection permanently. Now the decline of the fishing industry remains the same. Can we say that it has been saved? Has it been revitalized? No one can answer this question. The government is about to show great credibility to the people, or it will not change its mind frequently, as the rumors say. However, the fishermen are already on the verge of bankruptcy, with pirates robbing and Japanese fish being dumped on the market. They have not yet recovered, and they cannot bear to be plucked again. Hearing these rumors, they are extremely alarmed. In addition to sending telegrams to the Chairman of the National Government, the President of the Executive Yuan, and the Minister of Industry, requesting them to take charge, we are specially submitting this request to your association, hoping that you will consider the suffering of the fish merchants and fishermen, and quickly forward it to save them. We are deeply grateful." It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce is well aware of the difficult situation of the fishing industry and has already telegraphed Beijing to fight for their rights.</p>
<h3>Fire Insurance Compensation Issues in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Agreed on Claims Method The Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association, based on the resolutions of the previous policyholders' meeting, expanded the organization of the claims committee and held its first general assembly at the association yesterday to discuss claims methods and organize a sustained claims process. More than thirty people, including Tang Youwei, attended, chaired by Hu Yibo. It was decided to implement a phased claims method, including: (1) claims by teams, (2) each team having at least one hundred and at most two hundred people, convened and dispatched by the general association, (3) the date for starting claims being October 3, (4) the meeting place being decided as Tianhou Temple, (5) each team having two designated committee members for guidance and maintenance, and five others assisting, (6) the first group being Wang Zhixiang and six others, the second group being Cha Tongshan and five others, and the third group being Li Henglin and five others, responsible for handling situations in phases, (7) the meeting adjourned after discussions.</p>
<p>Request for Protection from Two Police Stations The Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association yesterday sent a letter to the British and French Concession police stations, stating: "To whom it may concern: Regarding the fire insurance compensation dispute in the Shanghai disaster area, we previously implemented claims, but temporarily suspended them out of respect for the opinions of various parties, waiting for a resolution. Unexpectedly, the insurance companies have no sincerity and have not taken any action. The policyholders are now struggling to survive and have no way to rebuild. They cannot wait any longer. Therefore, at the general meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 25th of this month, it was decided to expand the organization and proceed with claims. This concerns public rights and should be carried out in strict order. We would be grateful if your police station could send officers for special protection. Thank you for your public service."</p>
<h3>Workers of the Commercial Press Sue the Company</h3>
<p>Claiming Retirement Pension, Severance Pay, and Bonuses</p>
<p>Litigation Aid to Be Approved After Submission of Guarantee</p>
<p>During the January 28 Incident, the Commercial Press factory, the largest cultural institution in the country, was the first to be destroyed. Most of its books were burned, causing losses beyond tens of millions. This greatly damaged the vitality of the company, and China's cultural enterprise suffered a huge impact. Although the company has resumed operations, the scope has been slightly reduced, and workers have been laid off. Those who were laid off, due to the fear of unemployment, have collectively negotiated with the company, making various demands. The company has been unable to accommodate them. Initially, they filed a complaint with the Bureau of Social Affairs, but the results were minimal and unsatisfactory. Now, they have taken legal action in court. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Names of Plaintiffs and Defendants There are a total of 1,245 plaintiffs, all laid-off workers. For the convenience of litigation, Zhang Yingxiang and Tang Xiaozeng were publicly elected as representatives of the entire group. The names, ages, origins, and addresses of each person cannot be listed in a single complaint, so two large volumes of name lists have been created to make it easier for the judge to call them by name. The defendants include the Commercial Press Co., Ltd., as the first defendant, and Wang Yunwu, Zhang Yuanji, Li Xuangong, Xia Peng, Bao Qinglin, Gao Fengchi, Gao Mengdan, Huang Hanliang, Liu Zhanen, Guo Bingwen, Ding Rong, Ye Jingkui, and Zhang Chanfen, among others. The plaintiffs are represented by lawyers Xue Jiaqi and Wang Zuxun, while the defendants are represented by lawyer Li Zuyu.</p>
<p>Subject of the Lawsuit There are four items in total: (1) Order the defendants to pay a total of 351,412.30 yuan in retirement pensions. (2) Pay a total of 321,130.40 yuan in severance pay. (3) Order the defendants to calculate and report the amount of bonuses due to the plaintiffs for the 20th year and pay them. (4) The defendants shall bear the costs of this lawsuit.</p>
<p>Trial Proceedings Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Peng of the First Special District Court of First Instance opened the tenth courtroom for trial. Lawyers from both parties were present, but very few of the parties involved in the case were present. After the plaintiffs' lawyer briefly stated the intention of the lawsuit, he requested permission for litigation aid, stating that all the plaintiffs were currently unemployed and unable to pay the litigation costs. Judge Yang stated that a request for litigation aid should first be submitted with a guarantee, ensuring that the parties involved were indeed unable to pay, pending verification and approval. The lawyer was then instructed to comply with the procedure promptly, and the case was adjourned. The date for the hearing will be set after the litigation aid matter is resolved.</p>
<h3>Female Ticket Collectors of the Shanghai South Public Bus Company on Hunger Strike Due to Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs Schedules Formal Mediation for the 3rd</p>
<p>After the Shanghai South Public Bus Company ceased operations, the workers, pressed by livelihood issues, demanded a resumption of operations. After mediation by party and government agencies, the company refused to attend. All the workers entered the factory and stayed there. Two female workers went on a hunger strike. The Bureau of Social Affairs scheduled a mediation and strictly ordered the company to attend. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Female Workers on Hunger Strike All employees, in view of the company's refusal to accept government mediation, which has left workers with no means of livelihood, entered the Xuxie Road factory and stayed there the night before last. The police officers of the Public Security Bureau tried to dissuade them without success. Two female ticket collectors, No. 52 Xu Lie'e and No. 70 Hou Tingfen, after entering the factory, felt that the company was too insincere, causing delays until now without a resolution. The workers appealed without success and began a hunger strike yesterday morning to seek public justice. The Municipal Party Committee has sent cadre Fan Guoren to persuade the hunger-striking workers and investigate the matter for verification.</p>
<p>Workers' Congress The workers of the Shanghai South Public Bus Company held a meeting at the factory at 2:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Qian Shun'gao and Zhou Anshan, who reported on the situation. The following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) They vowed not to leave the factory until their goals were achieved. (2) If the capitalists sincerely obeyed the mediation of party and government agencies, all employees should accept it. (3) The reason for the company's suspension of operations was that the chairman misused public funds and appointed private individuals, causing business losses. His crimes should be announced. (4) They advised all shareholders to take office and maintain operations. (5) A fundraising team was organized to request economic assistance from all sectors, and Jiang Dade, Zhang Guanqing, Tian Shuzhen, Yan Xiuliang, and Lu Linliang were appointed as team leaders. (6) If the period is prolonged and cannot be resolved, all will go on a hunger strike. (7) A protection team will be organized to protect all the vehicles and other machinery in the factory. (8) They petitioned the party and government agencies to take over the city's operations to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Scheduled Mediation The Bureau of Social Affairs believes that the company's refusal to attend the mediation meeting, which has made it impossible to proceed, is inappropriate. It has scheduled a formal mediation for 1:00 PM on October 3 and strictly ordered the company to attend on time and await mediation. At the same time, it notified the workers to comply, in order to seek an early resolution.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs to Mediate Silk Factory Labor Dispute Today</h3>
<p>Workers at the Dan Shuang Gong Factory in Hongkou District Continued to Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>Female Workers Petition the Union, Causing Disturbances</p>
<p>In the city's silk factory labor dispute, workers at the Dan Shuang Gong Factory in Hongkou District continued to strike yesterday. Female workers petitioned the union, causing disturbances. The Bureau of Social Affairs has scheduled a formal mediation for today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Situation in Various Districts (1) All silk factories in the Zhabei District resumed work as usual. All directors and supervisors of the 6th District Silk Reelers' Union, together with armed police officers from the Public Security Bureau, protected female workers entering the factories at Liuying Road, Dayang Bridge, and Chang'an Road, and strictly prevented troublemakers. (2) All silk factories in the concession area sounded the whistle to start work. The 3rd District Silk Reelers' Union sent personnel to persuade the workers to work as usual, and the police sent officers to protect them entering the factories. (3) In the Hongkou District, all silk factories stopped whistling and starting work yesterday morning due to the workers' strike, and the female workers stayed at home waiting, indicating their continued strike. The Fulun Shuang Gong Factory at the end of Tianbao Road also stopped whistling and starting work yesterday morning. The strike order was good.</p>
<p>Workers' Petition Since the strike, which has lasted for many days, the workers in the Hongkou District silk factories have not had the issue of wages resolved even after mediation by party and government agencies. The night before last, more than 60 people gathered and went to the 4th District Silk Reelers' Union on Tiantong Road to petition, demanding a quick resolution. Cadre Lu Xusheng received them, saying that he had submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs for mediation and explained the situation. The Tiantong Road Police Station of the 5th Sub-district received a report and rushed to maintain order. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the striking workers again demanded action from the union. Fortunately, the police officers of the Public Security Bureau persuaded them to disperse.</p>
<p>Union's Report The 4th District Silk Reelers' Union yesterday submitted a document to the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating: "Report requesting prompt dispatch of personnel to investigate silk prices, uphold justice, and handle the labor dispute to avoid it escalating and endangering public safety. The union, with the approval of your bureau's mediation decision on September 26, began on the 27th to have labor and management try again to discuss ways to increase wages, restore promotions and holiday bonuses, and resume work. Unexpectedly, the Silk Factory Industry Guild not only did not comply with the appointment, but did not formally inform us of the proposed automatic opening of factories on the 28th, only making a friendly verbal statement. The union believes that the factory's actions are illegal, but in order to resume work as soon as possible, so that the workers can get more benefits, it has advised the workers and publicized the mediation decision made on the 26th. However, all the workers said that the current silk market price is more than 700 taels, which is more than 200 taels higher than the price when the conditions were signed in July, and the price of new cocoons this year is also low. Increasing wages and restoring promotions is indeed possible. Therefore, we are reporting the situation and requesting your review, approval, and prompt impartial mediation to benefit the workers and public safety. This would be very convenient for the party."</p>
<p>Formal Mediation The Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to resolve the labor dispute in the silk factory industry as soon as possible, has sent personnel to investigate silk prices in order to formally mediate. Yesterday, it also notified the Silk Factory Industry Guild and the 3rd District Silk Reelers' Union, saying: "Notice regarding the silk factory female workers' wage dispute, etc. This bureau has scheduled a mediation meeting for 1:00 PM on September 30. You are hereby notified to appoint two responsible representatives to come to the bureau to await mediation. This notice is hereby given. Wu Xingya, Director, Bureau of Social Affairs, September 29, 21st Year of the Republic of China." At the same time, the Municipal Party Committee and the Public Security Bureau were notified to send personnel to assist in the handling.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Solves Candle Industry Labor Dispute Yesterday</h3>
<p>Signed a Contract with a Total of Four Items</p>
<p>Both Parties Abide by Existing Conditions</p>
<p>Due to candle industry workers in this city claiming that various employers had violated labor contracts and hired outside workers, leading to a sharp increase in unemployment and causing a labor dispute, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a second mediation yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Labor representatives Chen Zenghao and Luo Qinxia, and employer representatives Shen Chengzhang and He Yinsheng, attended. The mediation was chaired by mediator Zhu Guilin. First, the employers stated that they had convened a general meeting on the 25th and decided that there was no room for mediation regarding the union's demands. The labor representatives stated that the workers' general meeting had decided to fight the employers to the death if their goals were not achieved. Then, discussions began. After repeated persuasion by the chairman, both parties agreed to a resolution and signed a contract: (1) The treatment conditions modified by labor and management on February 2, 1931 (Republic of China Year 20), shall be observed. (2) Yida Candle Shop violated Article 4 of the contract by hiring workers not from the Songtai gang; these workers shall be immediately dismissed and Songtai gang workers hired instead. (3) Changji Candle Shop is opened by the Ninghang gang, and its hiring of workers is not limited to the Songtai gang. (4) In the future, if Songtai gang shops change shareholders, reorganize, or resume business, they shall not hire outside workers, except when the old shareholders have completely severed ties.</p>

<h3>The Escaped Bandit Sentenced to Death Has Been Arrested Again in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Has been Escorted to Wuxi for Legal Proceedings</p>
<p>Li Chengguo, a notorious bandit who committed serious crimes of gathering gangs, armed robbery, and murder in Wuxi County, was pursued by the county police detectives. Li Chengguo and his accomplices, including Wang Baofu, resisted arrest with gunfire. Li escaped. Later, Liao Dajin, the county's detective stationed in Shanghai, arrested Li in Shanghai and escorted him back to Wuxi. After interrogation by the former County Magistrate Sun, Li was sentenced to death, which was approved by the provincial government. However, hours before the telegram from the provincial government approving the on-the-spot execution of the bandit arrived in Wuxi, Li led six other serious criminals, shackled, in an escape from prison, so the death penalty was not executed. Li Guocheng, a native of Jiangbei, returned to Jiangbei after escaping from prison, gathered local bandits, committed open robbery and looting, obtained huge sums of money, and then secretly came to Shanghai, hiding in a house on Kangti Road in the French Concession. The head of the Wuxi County water patrol learned of this, immediately reported to the county magistrate, prepared a document, and led the police to Shanghai by car at night to meet with the armed Chinese and Western detectives of the French Concession. They arrested Li Chengguo on Kangti Road, took him to the police station, and, with permission, had Captain Qian escort the bandit by train to Wuxi yesterday to be returned to the case for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Reporters' Association Presents to the Ministry of Railways Requesting Thorough Investigation of Chen Xinghan</h3>
<p>Violating the Resolution to Support the Newspaper Industry</p>
<p>Truly Feeling that His Behavior Is Inappropriate and His Position Is Unsuitable</p>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Reporters' Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating: "Submitting [this] for the insult of news reporters by Chen Xinghan, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, requesting that personnel be dispatched for a thorough investigation, in order to maintain the newspaper industry and prevent arbitrary actions. The flourishing and development of the newspaper industry depends on accurate news, disseminated to the masses, to avoid doubts and distortions of facts. Therefore, news reporters spare no effort to travel and interview, even in military emergencies, risking their lives to interview and report at any time to seek accuracy. On August 6 of this year, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by special train. Xu Shen and Wu Dong, reporters from the Central News Agency, obtained this information and rushed to the Maigen and Zhenru stations, on the one hand, to gather news, and on the other hand, to visit Premier Wang and inquire about political news. Unexpectedly, Chen Xinghan, the director of the two railway bureaus, interfered arbitrarily, shouted loudly, and ordered the railway police to forcibly expel them, and did not allow them to park their cars on the highway next to the station. Such ignorance and blatant insult, and the interference of a railway bureau director in municipal transportation, is an overreach of authority. Chen Xinghan, although he holds the position of director, is not a man of learning, and his rashness and recklessness may be due to a momentary rage. After the association received reports from members Xu Shen and Wu Dong, it did not want to trouble the listener hastily, so it sent a special letter to the director on the 18th, informing him that supporting the newspaper industry had been solemnly passed by the National Assembly, and that reporters going to the station to interview had been practiced for many years. How could he be allowed to shout and expel them arbitrarily? This action was truly humiliating to the personality of all reporters. We requested a clear written reply, and a guarantee that the above situation would not happen again in the future. Afterwards, the bureau director Chen Xinghan replied in a letter, roughly stating that he had received the letter of August 18, accusing him of insulting the members of the association. He was very sorry. When Premier Wang arrived in Shanghai, the members of the association, Xu and Wu, were among the idlers outside the station. He had never met them before, and was in a hurry, so he naturally could not distinguish whether they were indeed news reporters, so he dissuaded them from entering the station, but Xu and Wu insisted on entering the station, causing a misunderstanding. He regretted it deeply. As for the interference in municipal administration and overreach of authority, the iron fences of the Maigen Road freight station are all part of the railway's land. At that time, a rented car was parked there, and he advised it to drive away from the iron fence. Xu and Wu claimed that the degree of insult they received could not be regarded as an ordinary misunderstanding, and that the facts stated in the letter were inconsistent and seemed to be a clever cover-up. When Shen Dong and others arrived at the Maigen Road freight station, it was not yet dawn, and there were no idlers. Besides Shen Dong and the two others, there were only a dozen policemen and the so-called head of the general section. No one else was there. Half an hour later, Director Chen arrived and, as soon as he saw Shen Dong and others, shouted loudly and ordered the railway police to expel them. As soon as Shen Dong and others were about to explain their intentions, they were stopped by the regiment commander, so Shen Dong and others stood there waiting with bated breath, visible but unattainable. How could there have been insistence on entering the station? There was obstruction, but no dissuasion. Shen Dong and others had visited the bureau many times before. How could he be so forgetful? There is a gravel road in front of Maigen Road, running from south to north. At the end of the road, the freight station is to the east and the wooden pier to the west. Shen Dong and others' car was parked on the side of the road, where other cars were already parked, but Chen Xinghan forcibly ordered the car to drive away, which was inevitably discriminatory. If it is said that rented cars must be ordered to drive outside the fence, Shen Dong and others do not understand that there is a class difference between private cars and rented cars. If a distinguished guest comes from afar, they must hire a car and have no right to board the train at the station. This kind of view is not understood by everyone. The letter repeatedly states that the misunderstanding at the station was an unavoidable action in the line of duty to protect national defense. Then, when Shen Dong and others followed Premier Wang from Zhenru back to Shanghai, Chen actually ordered their car to block the road, preventing our car from moving forward for five minutes. If it was in the middle of the road and not at the station, what was the point? In short, what happened that day was definitely not an insult. All the members are extremely angry about this. They all believe that the director's behavior is inappropriate. To avoid such unfortunate events from happening again in the future, we are sending another letter to the director asking him to make a concrete statement, take responsibility for ensuring that members of this association are given official convenience when they come to the bureau to gather news and that there should be no obstacles and to express his apology in writing to appease the public anger, etc. After sending the letter, we have not received a reply, which is surprising. It is customary for reporters to visit important people at stations, both in China and abroad. It has also been practiced in Shanghai for a long time. However, the director made gestures and looked down on everyone. He did not understand the true meaning of supporting the newspaper industry and caused a major obstacle to the press. His bureaucratic bad habits are not suitable for the era of national politics, and his arbitrary insult shows that he does not want to cooperate with our press. Chen Xinghan's behavior is inappropriate and his position unsuitable. It is appropriate to state the details, submit them to your department for review, and grant personnel to conduct a thorough investigation, in order to maintain the newspaper industry and prevent arbitrary actions. And pray that you give instructions to comply, and you will be greatly grateful. Sincerely submitted to the Ministry of Railways, Qian Cangshuo, Yu Kongwo, Yan Esheng, Qu Shaoyi, Ma Chonggan, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Newspaper Reporters Association."</p>
<h3>A Man Was Assassinated on Ningbo Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday at about 8:50 PM, at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Guizhou Road, a man about 30 years old, wearing a white cloth shirt and trousers, white socks, and black cloth shoes, was chased along Guizhou Road by two or three workers. Before long, he was caught. The workers took out sharp blades from their sides and stabbed the man three times in the body, and then fled, abandoning their weapons. The man fell to the ground in a pool of blood. Fortunately, passers-by saw him and called for help. Police officers arrived after hearing the alarm and, seeing that the assailant had already fled, bravely chased after him. They apprehended one of the assailants and took him to the Lao Zha Police Station. Under interrogation, he confessed that there were other accomplices, and the police are still searching for them. The injured man was sent to Renji Hospital by the white police, but died due to his serious injuries. His body was immediately transported by car to the forensic examination office to await examination.</p>
<h3>Siblings as Enemies</h3>
<p>Older Brother Injures Younger Brother with a Knife</p>
<p>Younger Brother Asks the Judge to Punish His Older Brother</p>
<p>Huang Yun, a Cantonese resident living in a bungalow without a number on Xinji Bang Road, and his elder brother, Huang Haner, were at odds and had fought several times. At about 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Huang Han carried a kitchen knife and waited on Wuchang Road. His younger brother was returning home from working at a glass factory, passing by the area. Huang Han stepped forward to stop him, demanding to borrow 25 silver dollars. When he failed, they started arguing again. Huang Han then pulled out a kitchen knife and slashed his brother in the head and arms, causing him to fall to the ground and cry for help.冯孚 Feng Fu, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, and Chinese Constable No. 1883 arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested Huang Han, along with the murder weapon, and took them to the police station. The police chief, after questioning, ordered Huang Han to be detained. He then took the injured person to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the case. Then Detective Feng and the Chinese constable reported the details. The kitchen knife was presented for inspection. The injured party, Huang Yun, whose injuries were not serious, came to court and testified that the defendant was his elder brother, that they had already divided their property and supported themselves. Now, his brother often used various excuses to borrow money from him and had beaten him several times. Last night, he even used a knife to harm him. In his defense, Huang Han confessed that he was unemployed and planned to become a vendor, so he borrowed 25 yuan as capital. When his brother refused, he pushed him to the ground and used the kitchen knife to scare him in self-defense, without intending to harm his life. He added that he had been drinking excessively at the time, which caused the incident. He burst into tears and begged for leniency. The court asked Huang Yun who else was in his brother's family. He said a sister-in-law and a nephew. He was then asked that if his brother were sent to prison, who would support his sister-in-law and nephew. He said that the matter was instigated by his sister-in-law, and that his brother had previously pawned and used his wife's jewelry. He asked that the defendant be punished. Judge Chuan Lin verified the testimony and said to Huang Yun that the two of you were not behaving like brothers. He sentenced Huang Han to six months in prison, suspended for three years, with the right to appeal. He was also given a lecture.</p>
<h3>Russian Secretly Carries Mail to the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Since the Northeast puppet organization seized postal rights in the three northeastern provinces, the government authorities ordered the closure of the Northeast postal service. All mail to or from that area would not be delivered until the government had expressly ordered it to be unsealed. After the announcement of these measures, it was inconvenient for those who wanted to send letters to that area. As a result, a Russian residing in Shanghai, at the instigation of some person unknown, published a large advertisement in a local Russian newspaper, stating that anyone wishing to send various types of mail to the puppet state could have it delivered on their behalf. The prices were set at 2, 3, and 5 jiao, (roughly excluding heavy mail bags). The method of delivery was to hire poor Russians to travel directly to the area on foreign merchant ships and forward the mail. No stamps were affixed to the letters. The Russian's movements were extremely secretive. On the morning of the day before yesterday, when a merchant ship from Niuzhuang named Shunfu was about to leave the port, customs officers routinely boarded the ship to check for tax evasion or the export of prohibited items. They saw a Russian who looked flustered. Upon inspection, they found eight or nine packages of illegally sent mail, totaling 180 pieces. They believed that the Russian had dared to take this action to undermine China's laws. They immediately brought the witness to customs and informed the postal administration. Subsequently, the postal administration appointed Ge Fei as a representative to go to customs to discuss the matter. It was decided that customs would notify the water police to take the witness back to the police station. The Russian confessed that he was 35 years old. He admitted that he had privately sent the mail. The police chief He Dafu deemed the case important and led translator Gu Caiwen to escort the Russian suspect to the local court for prosecution. At 4:00 PM, the prosecutor interrogated the suspect and ordered him to be detained, pending an investigation of the mastermind behind the scheme before further legal action.</p>

<h3>Su Yanling Successfully Researches Tobacco Knives</h3>
<p>Is There Anyone Willing to Raise 40,000 Yuan?</p>
<p>To Fulfill My Vision for National Honor</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Native Tobacco Industry Association yesterday to promote the creation of native tobacco knives, saying: "We received a letter from Mr. Su Yanling on the 28th of this month, titled "Public Announcement for Soliciting the Manufacturing of Native Tobacco Knives." It says, 'After many years of effort, I have successfully improved the knife for shaving tobacco. Sales in Sichuan and Guangdong provinces have said that it is not inferior to foreign knives. However, due to limited personal financial resources, production has stopped due to a shortage of funds. I plan to raise 40,000 yuan to start business." This tobacco knife is required by the association. If Mr. Su can produce something that is comparable to foreign goods, it will benefit your industry. Mr. Su's correspondence address is Su Dekang inside the New North Gate of this city. We are sending this letter to you, along with a copy of the public announcement, for your consideration and to contact Mr. Su for handling it.' Here is an excerpt from the public announcement: "Our country's tobacco shaving knives were secretly made by the Lin family in Yongding, Fujian, with a patent for business. During the Qing Dynasty, the Japanese chemically copied them and sold them in our country. Their use was superior to the Lin knives, and the Lin knives were eliminated by natural selection. I lamented the outflow of interests and, without regard to my meager abilities, thought of reversing this trend. Twenty years ago, I joined forces with Su Junshang, president of the Shanghai Southern Chamber of Commerce, to raise funds to imitate the old method of knife making of the Lin family. We set up a furnace in the poor children's home to try casting, which cost us a great deal of money, but failed. Then, I cooperated with Su Yingjie, principal of the Minli Middle School, and my fellow villager Lai Mingsan, and still used steel, with slight improvements, which also failed. The tobacco knife, on the surface, is a very ordinary thing, but it is actually complicated. Without the research of an iron factory and the experience of a tobacco shaving factory, it is difficult to make it usable. However, I was determined to persevere and made up my mind to try again. Finally, because I grew up in a tobacco factory since I was a child, I gained more practical experience in using knives. I explored the good methods of knife making in Japanese factories. After several years of effort, the products were finally successful. They were sold in Sichuan and Guangdong provinces and were no less than foreign knives. However, my personal financial resources are limited, and the distribution in other ports is often delayed, making it difficult to manage. As a result, production was suspended. During last year's campaign to resist inferior goods, tobacco merchants in Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces repeatedly sent letters asking for assistance in raising funds to reorganize. It was found that the annual business of tobacco knives in our country is more than one million yuan. The shares borne by all parties are only a few thousand, which is difficult to develop. Therefore, learning from the past, I dare not act rashly, so that the Chinese people talk about resisting goods every day, but foreign knives still fill the market. Considering the country as a whole, there are no domestic tobacco knives that can be used as substitutes. Speaking of this, I am very heartbroken. I am old, and I know the method of making tobacco knives, but I cannot put it into practice. The strong neighbor steals my interests and sneers at me, despising the incompetence of my people. How shameful! Everyone loves their country as much as I do, so I am especially seeking enthusiastic comrades who are willing to raise or solicit funds of more than 40,000 yuan. I am willing to take on the work of guidance in order to benefit the people and stop the leakage of resources. I know that even if the eastern neighbor is violent, it cannot be said that there is no one in China. A small knife is related to the honor of the nation. I will be greatly honored, (excerpt below)."</p>

<h3>Fifteen Organizations Commemorate Guo Zibin</h3>
<p>Mr. Guo Zibin, a prominent merchant from Chaozhou, devoted his life to supporting public welfare, sparing no effort, and particularly enjoyed donating funds to promote education and charitable endeavors. He suddenly passed away in Shanghai on July 31st. The Chaozhou compatriots in Shanghai held a memorial service at the Poor Children's Education Center on Jiaozhou Road at 2:00 PM on the 28th. Representatives from organizations such as Datong University (Hu Guo Fu), Fudan University (Jin Tong Yin), Chaozhou Shanghai Association (Zheng Zheng Qiu), Shanghai Lianyi Charity Association (Lu Wen Zhong), Guangyi Chinese Hospital (Ding Zhong Ying), Chaozhou Heji Hospital (Guo Jiu Ru), China Textile Institute (Zhu Xian Fang), Chinese Cotton Mill Association (Zhang Ze Min), Hongzhang Textile Dyeing Factory (Zheng Yao Nan), Poor Children's Education Center (Guo Shou Chun), Mingde Charity Hall (Ouyang Yan Sheng), Shanghai High School (Wei Dai Xi), Gongshi Middle School, Shanghai Orphanage, and Chao Hui Elementary School, along with Chaozhou compatriots and guests from all walks of life, totaled over five hundred people. First, representatives from various organizations held a public memorial ceremony, performing rituals with music and flower offerings. Then, representatives from each organization respectfully read eulogies (most are omitted). After the ceremony, a memorial meeting was held, with representatives from each organization forming a presidium and electing Zheng Zheng Qiu as chairman. After taking their seats, a memorial song was sung. The chairman then delivered the opening remarks, stating that the joint meeting of fifteen organizations and many individuals to commemorate Mr. Guo Zibin was of great significance. The purpose was fundamentally pure, driven by sincerity, demonstrating that Mr. Guo Zibin's morality, achievements, and all actions worthy of inspiring future generations justified a joint commemoration by all organizations and individuals. Death is inevitable for all, especially since Mr. Guo Zibin lived past seventy, reducing the element of grief. However, society admired him, and this association expressed its condolences because of his spirit of courage in doing good. Therefore, although Mr. Guo Zibin's body was dead, his personality, reputation, spirit, and morality would live on forever. The purpose of this meeting was to instill in everyone an image of emulating his spirit and, acting with conscience, to do more work to save people. Next, Mr. Guo Qiming reported on Mr. Guo Zibin's life and deeds. Representatives from various organizations then gave speeches. Mr. Ding Zhongying stated that Mr. Guo Zibin could be called a reformer, industrialist, and philanthropist, whose life's achievements were worthy of commemoration. Mr. Hu Dunfu stated that Mr. Guo Zibin possessed all three virtues of establishing words, establishing virtue, and establishing achievements. We must consider how to continue Mr. Guo's achievements, understand Mr. Guo's intentions, and do our best to work for society, so that Mr. Guo's spirit may be further magnified. We must especially engage in national salvation based on Mr. Guo's spirit. Mr. Guo Shouchun stated that Mr. Guo Zibin's good deeds were widespread, both domestically and abroad, without limitations, and he was able to plan for the long-term benefit of charitable organizations. Therefore, Mr. Guo Zibin was not only a Guo Zibin of Chaozhou but a Guo Zibin of the entire country and the entire world. Other organization representatives also offered insightful words. After the meeting, a photograph was taken, and refreshments were served before dispersing.</p>
<h3>A Victim of a Train Robbery in Songhu Encounters Robbers Again</h3>
<p>Police Officer in the Same Car Acted Accordingly</p>
<p>One Thief Arrested at Jiangwan Station</p>
<p>Shen Yinhua, a resident of Cao Mujia Bridge in Songbei, is nearly sixty years old and has been working in Shanghai as a stonemason. His family has accumulated some savings. Around midnight the previous night, over ten robbers speaking with a Hakka accent suddenly came to his house. Five of them, each carrying a handgun, entered the door and frightened Shen's family into silence. They arbitrarily searched the house and forced Shen Yinhua to reveal the location of the hidden silver. When Shen refused, they burned off Shen's beard with matches, causing Shen extreme pain and fainting. It was truly cruel. The search lasted two hours before they left, taking over three hundred silver dollars and clothing worth about two hundred dollars. As they left, they fired a shot as a warning, hitting Shen's son, Shen Jinfang, in the forehead. Because it was late at night, the incident was not reported to the police. Yesterday afternoon (the 28th), Shen Jinfang boarded the Songhu train departing for Shanghai at 1:00 PM to seek medical treatment for his head wound. When the train arrived at Yunzaobang Station, Shen caught sight of five passengers boarding the train who were the robbers who had robbed his house the previous night. The train had already started, making it impossible to report to the police. Fortunately, Wang Zhenfan, a household registration police officer from the First Office of the Seventh District, was sitting next to Shen. Shen immediately reported the situation to Wang. Since Wang was not armed and was outnumbered, he had to act as circumstances dictated. When the train arrived at Jiangwan Station, the robbers seemed to have noticed and mingled in the crowd, hastily getting off the train to escape. Seeing this, Officer Wang, along with Shen, followed them off the train. He blew his whistle and bravely gave chase. The patrol officers from the Fifth Office of the Fifth District also helped in the pursuit. As a result, Officer Wang captured one thief on the spot, while the other four escaped. Twenty-five bullets were found on the captured thief. He was immediately taken to the Fifth Office of the Fifth District, where Chief Dai interrogated him personally. The thief confessed that his name was Zhou Zhengkui, 36 years old, from Funing, Jiangbei, and lived near the Nancao Temple in Wusong Port. After verifying the confession, Chief Dai escorted the prisoner to Song and reported to Chief Yang of the First Office of the Seventh District. After a brief inquiry, he immediately ordered detectives to rush to a dilapidated boat near Nancao Temple and arrest a female bandit, Zhou Chen, and bring her to the office for strict investigation in order to find and arrest the other fugitives.</p>
<h3>Woman with Metal Chain Suffocated to Death</h3>
<p>Qin, wife of Qin Deming, a villager at No. 1 Xujiazhai, Songhu Road, Yinxiang Township, Hudong District, was 37 years old. She recently suffered from mental illness and became so deranged that she could not be approached. Qin, distressed by this, locked her neck with an iron chain and tied her to the bed. However, the madwoman was unaware of the danger, so even though her neck was locked with an iron chain, she still moved around wildly in bed. On the first day of the previous month, her limbs moved non-stop, and by the evening, she was exhausted and hoarse. The chain around her neck tightened due to excessive struggling, leading to suffocation and death. Yesterday morning, when Qin went to check on her, he found that she was dead. He then reported to the police station. Because Qin had committed murder, he was immediately arrested and ordered the local bailiff to report to the local court for an inquest.</p>
<h3>Old Life Lost in Train Theft</h3>
<p>Chen Juxiang, a farmer living in Chen Geng Lane, west of the Hongqiao Road airfield in West Shanghai, was 54 years old. Yesterday morning at eight o'clock, she came to Shanghai from her home to buy items to prepare for her son's wedding. While walking to Chengjiaqiao and riding the British-owned Fourth Road public bus, there were many passengers on the bus. When she was not paying attention, the more than one hundred yuan in cash she carried was stolen. Chen did not realize it at the time. It was not until she went shopping in a South Goods store in Xujiahui that she realized the money in her bag had disappeared. Chen was very frustrated and returned home dejectedly. With the wedding date approaching, she had no way out. In anger and despair, she committed suicide by hanging herself last night. Her son, Jinsheng, was heartbroken when he learned of this. Chen's body has not yet been collected for burial.</p>
<h3>First District Arrests Five Robbers from Asia Oil Company</h3>
<p>Plotting to Re-Rob Hongchang Foreign Goods Store Owner</p>
<p>Recently, robbery and murder cases in various districts of the city have been frequent. Yesterday, the First District Police Department arrested two principal offenders and three suspects in the robbery of the Asia Oil Company in Pudong. It was reported to the First District Police Department that secret agent Xu Yongfu had reported that several members of the gang who robbed the Asia Oil Company in Pudong were gathering somewhere to discuss plans. They were scheduled to meet at 7:00 PM in Qingyan Alley to rob the home of the manager of Hongchang Foreign Goods Store at No. 23 Qingyan Alley. Upon receiving the report, the First District Police Department dispatched detective team leader Dong Mingde, along with detectives Yu Maolong, Yuan Haishan, Zhang Zhongliang, Peng Baolin, Ren Shouzhi, and Nie Ganchen, to disguise themselves and lie in ambush in various locations near the alley and Lujiabang. At about 6:00 PM, the bandits Sun Liangcai and Li Yonglin (the Pudong robbers) arrived first. Wang Er (Wang Debiao), who was scheduled to bring weapons, had not yet arrived. As it was getting dark, the two bandits paced back and forth, appearing anxious. The neighbors on the left and right, mostly from Jiangbei, noticed the detectives lying in ambush and began whispering among themselves. Fearing that the bandits would detect them and escape, the detectives gave a signal and rushed out of ambush, immediately grabbing the two bandits. They also captured three suspicious suspects and brought them back to the district police department. District Chief Guan Gong personally interrogated them and then prepared a document to send them to the Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Founding of the Seafarers United Association</h3>
<p>The Seafarers United Association on the Bund of the French Concession held a membership meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department (Zhong Quan), the Social Affairs Bureau (Rao Qiangsheng), the Merchants General Bureau (Ji Xiaozhou), and the Seafarers Union (Zhang Jianbai), as well as individuals such as Li Guojie, Wu Xingya, and Yang Hu, sent representatives to participate. Over one hundred members attended. The details of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparatory Process: At 10:00 AM, the meeting was called to order with a bell, and formalities were observed. First, Chairman Wang Yongsheng reported on the purpose of the meeting and the preparatory process. He stated that the association was a self-organized group of seafarers, aiming for labor-management cooperation to promote the development of the shipping industry. In terms of self-interest, it would strive to protect the interests of its members in the spirit of mutual assistance, so that both the nation and society could benefit, and the association would not be established in vain. As for the association's initiation, it was first assisted by brothers, Cai Tongshen, and Shi Chunhui, and supported by fellow seafarers. It then received permission from the Party and government organs. The preparation has lasted three months, and today is the first day of the association's establishment. He hoped that everyone would work together from today onwards.</p>
<p>Election of Directors: Next, directors were elected: Wang Yongsheng, Cai Tongshen, Shi Chunhui, Chen Songnian, Pan Ruilin, Zhang Ayan, and Zhang Baotai. Two alternate directors were elected: Xu Aliang and Zhang Xiangquan. Three supervisors were elected: Gu Quanfu, Zhang Qingfu, and Zhang Shunsheng. One alternate supervisor was elected: Wang Xinkuan.</p>
<p>Speeches by Representatives: After the election, Municipal Party Department representative Zhong Quan delivered a speech, saying, "I hope two things from your association: (1) to unite and develop the association's affairs, and (2) to embrace the spirit of labor-management cooperation and mutual assistance to consolidate our foundation." Social Affairs Bureau representative Rao Qiangsheng then gave a speech, saying, "Seafarers have a glorious page in the history of the revolution. In the future, I hope that your association can achieve the true purpose of mutual assistance among seafarers, so that China's shipping industry can become common to the whole world. This is a significant meaning of today's meeting." Next, Merchants General Bureau representative Ji Xiaozhou delivered a speech, saying, "Your association is very well-organized. I represent General Manager Li and can provide practical assistance to all your association's measures, so that both labor and management can cooperate to develop the shipping industry." Finally, Seafarers Union representative Zhang Jianbai delivered a speech, saying, "Your association has the same nature as the union. Your work helps the union with what capital cannot do, so your organization is really necessary for today's Chinese shipping industry." After the speeches, association representative Wang Yongsheng delivered a thank you speech, and the meeting was adjourned after a photograph was taken.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Purchases New Ning Steamer</h3>
<p>Operating Around Yichang</p>
<p>To expand its shipping business in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, China Merchants Bureau has purchased a 500-ton commercial steamer from Hong Kong, named "New Ning". The contract has been signed, and the bureau has assigned Captain Li Cunyou to take 48 crew members, sailors, and stokers on the *Huzhou* steamer to Hong Kong to bring the steamer to Shanghai, then sail to Hankou to operate around Yichang.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Apprentice Scalded to Death</h3>
<p>Gu Xueqin, a 19-year-old apprentice at Ruichang Printing Shop at No. 23 Tangshan Road, went to the upper floor of the shop with two other apprentices, Zhao and Ji, around 8:00 PM the previous night to fetch gasoline for use. However, there were no electric lights installed in that area, so it was extremely dark. Unable to find anything, Gu took a lighter to use as a light source. Unexpectedly, due to carelessness, the fire fell into the gasoline bucket, igniting it immediately. Gu and the other two were all scalded. When employees of the shop, such as Miao Ruian, learned of the incident, they managed to extinguish the fire and sent the three injured apprentices to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, Gu died due to the severity of his injuries. The other two are not in life-threatening danger. The hospital reported to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered investigators to investigate the incident. The body was then taken to Filun Road. Yesterday morning, a report was filed with the First Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to the location to examine the body. After Miao Ruian testified to the circumstances of the incident, Judge Guo ruled that the deceased, Gu Xueqin, had indeed died from being scalded by fire. The body was handed over to Miao Ruian for burial after he provided a bond.</p>
<h3>Case of Singer's Large Sum Stolen</h3>
<p>Thief Actually Comes to Discuss Repayment Method</p>
<p>Victim Arrests Him and Files Lawsuit in Court</p>
<p>Xie Cuiyun, a singer from Nanjing, is 19 years old and lives at No. 13 Meilan Lane, Jule Road, French Concession. In the spring of this year, her roommate, Zhu Dingbang (20 years old, from Songjiang), stole 960 yuan in silver and a deposit book from Juxingcheng Bank worth 2,200 yuan. He withdrew the money and used it. The other day, Zhu actually dared to come to Xie's house to discuss how to repay the money. Xie's mother reported to the police station, and detective Liu Jinrong arrested Zhu. Yesterday, he was handed over to the Second Special Court Criminal Division for investigation. First, the police lawyer Yuan Jiahan stated the case, saying that the defendant had committed a crime under Article 337 of the Criminal Code and requested an investigation. The plaintiff, Xie Cuiyun, stated that the defendant, Zhu Dingbang, and two of his friends came to rent the woman's pavilion room in the spring of this year. On March 6, while the woman was out, he sneaked into the room and stole the cash and deposit book from the drawer. She only discovered this on the 15th, when the woman wanted to withdraw money for use, so she reported to the police station to request an arrest. It was only now that they met again, and she requested prosecution. When questioned, Zhu Dingbang said that the money was actually borrowed from the plaintiff and lost in the exchange. This time, the civilian came to the plaintiff's house to discuss repayment methods and was falsely accused of theft. He asked for investigation. Zhu Dianqing, the lawyer, argued that this case was entirely a creditor-debtor relationship and should not be prosecuted criminally. If it were theft, how could the defendant dare to go to the plaintiff's house to discuss repayment? Moreover, the defendant moved to Hehefang in August of this year, and the plaintiff, Xie Cuiyun, often went to visit him, which shows that the money was not stolen. He requested that the case be dismissed. Judge Wu instructed Zhu to post bail and leave.</p>
<h3>Xinghua Longan Detained and Moldy</h3>
<p>Shanghai Trade Electrically Instructs Jiang to Release</p>
<p>The longan industry in this city reported that this year's Xinghua longan was subjected to heavy taxes by He Xianzhu, the brigade commander and director of the Post-War Bureau of Putian and Xianyou in Fujian Province. The *Shun'an* wheel was also confiscated to prevent export. The association believes that if these longans are not exported, they will all rot, resulting in losses of millions. Therefore, they urgently telegraphed Chairman Jiang in Hankou yesterday, asking him to arrest and severely punish the perpetrators and release the wheel. The original telegram said, "To Chairman Jiang in Hankou, Fujian Xinghua is heavily taxed and slaughtered by He Xianzhu, the provincial defense army. The people have no way to survive. We have presented petitions and appealed, waiting for rescue. He Xianzhu is intensifying his tyranny, daring to deliberately detain the Shun'an Wheel, which carries the first batch of more than a thousand tons of longan, in an attempt to impose heavy taxes. According to the regulations, the Xinghua Longan industry as a whole agreed that ships would be loaded and exported at the same time and should not be delayed. Now that the Shun'an Wheel has been detained and cannot be exported as scheduled, it will inevitably become moldy, resulting in losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Merchants are on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, we urgently request that a team be sent to Xinghua to arrest and severely punish He Xianzhu, so that the new longans will not rot. We are extremely anxious and await orders. Xing'an Guild in Shanghai, Shunli, Shun'an, Zhen'an, and other three companies, all bow in respect."</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Sentenced to Five Years Each</h3>
<p>On the 14th of last month, at 5:00 AM, the home of Wu Ma, a Suzhou woman at No. 65 Gello Road, French Concession, was invaded by thieves who stole clothing and other items worth several thousand dollars. When the thieves were escaping with the loot, one of them, named Qian Fu, carried the loot to the Public Concession and was intercepted by a patrolman and taken to the police station. In desperation, the thief took out a handgun and shot himself in the waist. The patrolman snatched a handgun with five bullets and sent him to the hospital for treatment, but he died. Afterwards, detectives from the special agency of the French Police Department arrested five people: Wang Ziming, Fei Yongxing, Yu Youqing, Jiang Yihai, and Qian Jue, who received the stolen goods. A handgun with two bullets was also found in Wang's possession. They were sent to the Second Special Court and prosecuted for robbery under Article 348 of the Criminal Code. The Public Concession Police Department also sent the suicide handgun of the thief to the case. After repeated hearings by Criminal Court President Wang Wangxu, a lawyer was appointed to defend the defendants, and the closing arguments were declared. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang delivered the judgment in Criminal Court No. 1, sentencing Wang Ziming, Huang Yongxing, Yu Youqing, and Jiang Yihai to five years in prison each for the crime of robbery with dangerous weapons and gathering in groups of three or more. Qian Jue was sentenced to one year in prison for receiving stolen goods. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted. The two handguns and seven bullets are confiscated.</p>
<h3>Unnamed Man Commits Suicide by Jumping from Building</h3>
<p>Worker-Like Figure, Approximately Thirty Years Old</p>
<p>Jumped from the Sixth Floor of the New World Amusement Park</p>
<p>Yesterday at 6:00 PM, the rooftop amusement park of the New World on Nanjing Road was crowded with tourists when suddenly a man, approximately thirty years old, wearing a gray twill cloth jacket and pants, with a white sweat towel around his waist, resembling a worker, jumped from the sixth floor towards Guizhou Road. His brains splattered on the spot, and he died. The cars parked by the roadside were all splattered with brains. A nearby patrol officer saw this and immediately reported to the police station. The Red Cross sent a vehicle to transport the body to the Filun Road autopsy station. Upon examining the deceased, only two copper coins were found on him. Nothing else was found. His name and address have not yet been verified. Based on the circumstances, it is possible that he committed suicide due to poverty.</p>
<h3>Hua Lian Hospital Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>The Hua Lian Hospital, prepared by the Hua Lian Associations of various ports, has been arranged and is located on Maitehesiduo Road. It is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on October 10th, and begin providing medical consultations and free medicine. It is reported that the hospital was originally planned to be a plague hospital in Zhabei. However, overseas Chinese sent telegrams, stating that the name "plague" only implies relief for the poor during epidemics and that the time would be short and unsustainable. After repeated consideration by those involved, it was decided to name it Hua Lian Hospital. Its nature is entirely charitable, with the aim of providing medical consultations and free medicine to the poor and sick. The first board meeting was held at the Great China Hotel the other day, and Xu Jigong, chairman of the Hua Lian Association, was elected as chairman of the board. The vice-chairmen are Yin Shang Guo Shun and famous doctor Wu Jishun. The standing directors are Mao Kelun, Yang Baoling, two famous doctors, and overseas Chinese Huang Jianzhong.</p>
<h3>Doctor Suspects Wife of Infidelity, Wife Unable to Endure Abuse and Requests Divorce</h3>
<p>Song Tianxiang, a doctor from Ningbo, was engaged to Tu Fumei, a woman from the same village, through a matchmaker. They returned to their hometown and married on October 13th of the 19th year. Three days later, he brought his new wife to Shanghai. After living together for a few days, he suddenly accused Tu of not being a virgin. First, he forced her to go to a female gynecologist on Baike Road for examination. Although the doctor informed him that she was indeed a virgin before marriage, Song remained suspicious and did not believe it. He then had her examined at Fukumin Hospital, established by the Japanese, but the results did not dispel his doubts. Tu's brother had heard the news in their hometown and came to Shanghai to reason with Song, and a peaceful resolution was reached. Unexpectedly, after Tu's brother left, Song's treatment of Tu became even more severe. He had an affair and put his wife out of his mind. Last spring, Tu's mother came to Ningbo out of concern for her daughter, and Song clashed with her again. From then on, the couple quarreled every day and had almost no feelings for each other. Recently, Tu hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a petition with the First Special District Court, requesting mediation for divorce. As mediation failed, she formally filed a lawsuit for divorce, requesting a divorce and that the defendant pay damages of 2,000 yuan and alimony of 18,000 yuan. Song, having been sued, also hired lawyer Tang to defend himself, saying that the plaintiff often did not return home late at night after marriage. When he advised her, it led to discord. After mediation by relatives and friends, they had reconciled. The plaintiff took advantage of his lack of preparation and ran away with her belongings. He requested that the original lawsuit be rejected and that she compensate him for all losses amounting to 3,480 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang opened the court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Tu Fumei, described in detail the insults and abuse she suffered from Song. When Song Tianxiang was questioned, he mostly denied it and claimed that he was a</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>broker and that it was not easy to marry a wife and that he did not want a divorce. If the plaintiff insisted on a divorce, all expenses incurred should be borne by the plaintiff. Judge Yang then stated that the plaintiff had stated that she could not afford the litigation fees and had applied for litigation assistance. Although she had completed the bond in accordance with the regulations, it still needed to be investigated. The defendant's counterclaim had not yet been paid for, and the procedure was not complete. Therefore, he ordered the case to be rescheduled for further review.</p>

<h3>Recent News on Shanghai Library Affairs</h3>
<p>There are three noteworthy recent developments in Shanghai library affairs: (1) The Shanghai Library Correspondence School, a training institution for senior library staff, still does not produce enough graduates to meet the needs of libraries in various places.

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>Regarding the article published in your newspaper on the 20th of this month about the Pacific American Line dismissing Chinese workers to alleviate unemployment in the United States, the reason for the recent layoffs by the American Line is not as stated. Your newspaper has a prominent reputation and will surely welcome accurate facts. Here is a detailed account of the actual situation for your newspaper: (1) The layoff measure is not limited to the Pacific American Line. All American shipping lines transporting American mail are also implementing it. (2) The layoffs are due to the provisions of the American Shipping Postal Service Act of May 28, 1928, and must be followed. The act states, "From May 28, 1928, all crew members of American ships with licenses must be American citizens. Within four years of the enactment of this act, those using nautical mail ships in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall have half of the personnel on board each time they leave the United States (personnel on board refers to all employees on board in addition to crew members) shall be American citizens. After May 28, 1932, two-thirds of the aforementioned personnel on board shall be American citizens. Therefore, for ships registered with the US government and transporting US mail to all parts of the world, no more than one-third of the foreign personnel on board shall exceed one-third, meaning all non-American personnel among the personnel on board. In addition to Chinese, many other foreign personnel have also been dismissed." On May 28 of this year, half of the personnel on these ships were mostly foreign. However, according to the above-mentioned postal contract, the number of foreign personnel should be reduced to one-third. Recently, the American Mail Ship Company repatriated Chinese personnel on board to their place of origin, not to alleviate unemployment in the United States, but because of the existence of the contract that had to be fulfilled. Most American mail ships, with Shanghai as their port of call, previously had 77 Chinese personnel, but now they only have 44. However, there are no plans to further dismiss Chinese employees. The American Consulate General in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Right and Wrong</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>I once saw a passage in a foreign textbook that said: "Everyone has two bags, one in front and one in back. In the front one, he puts the faults of others; in the back one, he puts his own faults. Therefore, the faults of others are easy to see, while one's own faults are difficult to know." This is truly a world-awakening saying that pierces the human malady of being "clear in observing others but dim in examining oneself."</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Jinan yesterday, Jiang Bocheng stated that, according to Han Fuju's report, Liu Renzhen was still causing chaos. According to Liu Zhennian's report, Han was still oppressing. Each held his own position, and even the central government could not discern the truth. Of course, since both sides had resorted to force, both had reasons for believing they were right and not wrong. Each had his own reasons. Newspapers merely recorded what was heard, and naturally, they were even more at a loss and could not make a critical judgment.</p>
<p>However, "The lack of clarity about right and wrong, and the absence of justice, has been a long-standing problem." Even with the creation of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the Japanese side still made strong arguments, claiming that the Japanese army's actions in the Eastern Provinces were based on legitimate and lawful self-defense rights, and that the establishment of Manchukuo was due to the free will of the local people. And the League of Nations, which was supposed to uphold justice, only "accommodated" and "evaded" and dared not make a fair judgment. What right and wrong are there in the world?</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said, "Humans eat grass-fed and grain-fed animals, deer eat grass, centipedes like to eat snakes, and crows like to eat rats. Who knows the true taste of the four? From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, and the paths of right and wrong, are confused and disorderly. How can I know their differences?" It can be seen that the difficulty in clarifying right and wrong did not begin today. However, it is even worse now. Clearly, what they do is all wrong, but what they say is all right. We can only "affirm what they deny and deny what they affirm." In the end, it is equivalent to neither affirming nor denying. Since there is neither affirming nor denying, what way will you use to judge their right and wrong?</p>

<h3>Autumn Night Viewing the River and Moon</h3>
<p>— Hu Weimin</p>
<p>Time flies easily, who can hold it back? In how many turns has it returned to autumn? The moon is infinitely beautiful tonight, and being in a foreign land doubles one's sorrow. The wave shadows in the river's heart are like lantern shadows, and the water flowing along the banks is like the moon flowing. How many fishing families admire this evening, their laughter faintly carried on the light boats.</p>
<p>The ripples of the Pu River reflect the clear moonlight, and the autumn sorrow is a thousand feet deep, longing for home. People stay at sea, with no day to return, and the moon shines on the river, going on silently. The waves surge and splash the shore, and the mist and clouds slant into the eye, bright and clear. Do not betray the intention of this good time, you should accompany the fairy Chang'e until the fifth watch.</p>

<p>The propagation of ordinary plants is mostly natural, with methods including stems that creep, seeds that eject themselves, or are carried by animals, blown by the wind, or float on water, scattering the seeds and propagating their species. Generally, herbaceous plants have many seeds, which are well-suited for natural propagation. However, flowers, trees, and fruit trees have very few seeds. Often, the new plants grown from seeds are not as good as the old trees. Therefore, it is not suitable to use natural propagation methods for flowers, trees, and fruit trees, but rather artificial propagation methods. These methods can be roughly divided into four types: cutting, layering, division, and grafting, which are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Cutting: Most plants, when their branches are cut off and inserted into the soil, or wrapped in water-soaked material, can take root and slowly grow. This is called cutting. The leaves of the cuttings should be slightly removed, and they should be inserted in a place with very little sun to reduce water evaporation and avoid the harm of withering. This cutting method is most suitable around the beginning of spring or during the plum rain season. Flowers, trees, and fruit trees such as willows, roses, chrysanthemums, and pomegranates are all propagated using this method.</p>
<p>(2) Layering: In early spring or summer, bend the stem of a plant to the ground, cover it with soil, and when it roots, separate it to form a new plant. This is called layering. Many plants, such as grapes, wisteria, mulberry trees, and locust trees, are propagated using this method.</p>
<p>(3) Division: Division has two types: root division and stem division. Transplanting new branches that grow on the roots to other places is called root division. Cutting off the new lateral stems near the roots and transplanting them elsewhere is called stem division. Generally, creeping or underground-stem plants, such as sweet dew and water chestnuts, are suitable for stem division. As for wintersweet, daffodils, and crabapples, they are suitable for root division.</p>
<p>(4) Grafting: Using a branch of one plant called the scion and inserting it into the trunk of another plant called the rootstock, allowing the cambium layers of the two plants to combine and grow, is called grafting. The scion and rootstock must be of very similar species and of equal size, or a small branch can be grafted onto a large rootstock. Generally, grafting should be done in early spring, when the tissues of the flowers and trees are still dormant and their vitality is about to be activated. Later, when the tissues begin to grow, the scion and rootstock will unite, and the wound will heal. Nowadays, fresh fruits, rare flowers, and exotic plants are all propagated using this method, and their characteristics are also changed. For example, all of the best apples, pears, and oranges in the United States are propagated using this method to preserve and propagate superior varieties. If dozens of types of cherry branches or many cacti are grafted onto one rootstock, plants with peculiar forms can be created.</p>

<h3>Summer Vacation Need Not Be Abolished</h3>
<p>— Ci Min</p>
<p>The weekly system in general institutions and schools has long become a habit. Everyone lives in this routine and doesn't feel anything. Suddenly, Mr. Zhenzhi, like a bolt from the blue, shouted out the slogan of abolishing it in this publication, which really surprised and admired his profound consideration, but at the same time, I felt that he was honestly pathetic and meddlesome. Mr. Zhenzhi "specially singled out the schools," clarifying the scope of the discussion on this issue, so our discussion should focus on schools.</p>
<p>My reasons for believing that the weekly system need not be abolished are as follows:</p>
<p>Due to the poverty and decline of our national economy, the majority of the people have lost the opportunity to receive school education; due to the emptiness of the content of our education, a part of the youth who enjoy special and excellent educational rights find it difficult to pursue advanced studies; due to the intense collision of old and new ideas in our country and the instability of the general public's life, the generally educated youth are hesitant and looking around. With these various reasons, it is impossible to talk about improving the general public's knowledge level in our country or making our science prosperous. Mr. Zhenzhi does not focus on the big picture, but instead abandons the fundamental and pursues the superficial, and starts from the viewpoint that "Sunday is the most uneconomical and wasteful," skips the steps of "putting in more effort," "increasing public intelligence," and "making science prosperous," and ends with the conclusion of national strength. Such a way of reasoning, which is off by a hair's breadth but misses by a thousand miles, is so close to fantastical extravagance!</p>
<p>Even if we take a step back and admit that "Sunday can be abolished," may I ask whether the Sunday that Mr. Zhenzhi wants to abolish can enable the general youth and students to put in more effort and achieve national strength? The university and middle school students in our country are naturally the pillars of the country and the most promising youth of the future. Many important responsibilities are placed on their shoulders, but are they willing to "put in more effort"? Generally speaking, Sunday is of course their day to play. How interesting it is to watch movies, dance... In ordinary times, to be honest, they are also unwilling to "put in more effort." A friend of mine personally said to me, "This semester, I only attended twenty-six classes, and I don't care about anything else." Although this is too outrageous, how can it be possible to require the youth who are usually so unwilling to put in effort and unwilling to "put in more effort" to "put in more effort" on the Sunday that Mr. Zhenzhi wants to abolish? Conversely, those promising young people who are usually able to "put in more effort" may not be willing to let the good time of Sunday slip away, so why does Mr. Zhenzhi need to be so anxious? If Mr. Zhenzhi really wants to begrudge the time for the general youth, then Mr. Zhenzhi certainly believes that the annual two-month summer vacation and three-week winter vacation are a case of "one day of sunshine, ten days of frost," and he will shout loudly: "Abolish summer and winter vacations!" What do you think, Mr. Zhenzhi?</p>
<p>My point is: the weekly system does not directly prevent the general youth who are currently studying in our country from "putting in more effort"; the suggestion to abolish the weekly system in order to get the youth to "be willing to put in more effort" definitely cannot bear this mission. This is an education issue and a social issue. Because of this, the weekly system does not indirectly hinder the prosperity of science in our country, and further, it does not hinder the strength of our country. The weekly system is not "unabolishable," but "need not be abolished."</p>
<p>Other issues, such as "the weekly system contains religious meaning," "teachers feel bored after the abolition of the weekly system," "what is happening in foreign countries, what was happening in ancient China," are not only too far from the topic, but also very impractical, so I will not discuss them!</p>
<p>Random Remarks</p>
<h3>Shanghai Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>People who are old in Shanghai say that Shanghai has three stinks: the smell of feces in the morning, the smell of copper coins during the day, and the smell of human flesh at night. If you add the smell of sweat in the summer, it becomes four stinks. I think: "If the four stinks are not eradicated, Shanghai will perish."</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>After a pilgrimage to Nanjing Road, and then turning to the Suzhou River, looking at those thatched sheds will make you strongly feel the disparity in human living standards, just like "the Lushan Waterfall, plunging ten thousand feet!"</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly prosperous. Some people say it is the "Paris of the East," meaning that it can be compared to Paris, France, and even surpass it! Shanghai has extraterritoriality for foreigners, concessions of famous countries, and foreign troops stationed there. May I ask, does Paris have these? To say that it "surpasses" it in this way, who would say it is inappropriate!</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>I heard that various factories in Shanghai have recently been unwilling to hire male workers. The biggest reason is naturally that male workers are mischievous, strong, and love to cause labor unrest. The second reason is that female workers can be used to adjust the lives of the staff.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Coming back from the Waibaidu Bridge, I felt like I had watched a famous historical drama. In the sky were modern airplanes, and on the bridge were modern cars and trams. Under the bridge, there were still remnants of thousands of years ago: civilian boats, rocking and singing there. Especially those mud-yellow naked children and women on the boats, and the powdered girls, young ladies, and young mistresses on the bridge, complemented each other interestingly.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>The average Shanghai person earns ten silver dollars and spends at least more than nine of them on clothing. Food and accommodation are secondary, and savings are even more unnecessary. Ancient sages only said "food and sex are human nature," but now Shanghai people have to add clothing to their lives.</p>

<h3>The Transformation of Love</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Man: My love! Do you feel it? Your attitude towards me has completely changed recently. You don't love me like you used to.</p>
<p>Woman: Ah! Yes, that may be true, but you are not able to understand me like you used to.</p>
<p>Man: No, I still understand you the same way, even more so than before. But you are completely different from before. Recently, you have simply not thought about the obligations you should fulfill in love. You take the love I have given you too lightly. This makes me very embarrassed, and sometimes even makes me feel that life is meaningless.</p>
<p>Woman: This is your fantasy, maybe you have overestimated our love. You are now too harsh on me, which is like asking a woman to always be a young girl; but is this possible? I'll tell you the truth; in my girlhood, I used to observe love like you. I even loved more passionately. I thought that the most important meaning of life was love, and that love was the whole of my life. But now, looking back, it is really ridiculous. Of course, because my observation was too shallow at that time. Now that I have more life experience, I feel that there are things in life that are more important than love, which means that I cannot live entirely for love.</p>
<p>Man: But I feel sorry for you. I don't understand when you developed such a base consciousness? Do you want to insult our sacred love with a frivolous attitude?</p>
<p>Woman: Haha, love is sacred? Stop talking nonsense like that. Friend! What is sacred? Tell me, in this dog-eat-dog era, are there still sacred things? I said before: I once regarded love as the whole of my happiness, but what did I get? Not happiness, but annoyance. This annoyance has continued until now, and sometimes I even want to commit suicide because of this annoyance.</p>
<p>Man: But, no matter what, you still have to love me, because I have not changed my concept of love. I still love you now, even more than before. I believe I can continue like this until the day I die. Then you should consider the obligations you owe me. You have no reason to reduce your love for me.</p>
<p>Woman: No, my reason has already been stated, because I feel that I cannot give up the career that is more important than loving you, which is the reason why I cannot love you as I used to.</p>
<p>Man: No, impossible, ten thousand times impossible.</p>
<p>Woman: No, impossible also becomes possible. To be honest, your love is indeed hindering me. You want to occupy me entirely, and have me sacrifice my entire self in your love, which is absolutely impossible. Friend! Haven't I told you several times? Love is only a part of life, not the whole of life. Love is only for promoting the development of life, not for hindering the development of life. If a person lives for love, then he is underestimating the value of life. True, I love you, you are needed in my life, but I want to love humanity more, I want to love the working masses more, I want to seek liberation for the oppressed masses, because this is the development of my life, the improvement of my life.</p>
<p>Man: Oh! You want to destroy me.</p>
<p>Woman: That's right! Take me as a demon. Beat me, curse me, and please forget me within the realm of possibility. Ah! What a delightful thing this is!</p>
