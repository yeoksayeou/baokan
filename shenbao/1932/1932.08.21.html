<p>時評</p>
<h3>惲案之法律觀翰</h3>
<p>上海青年惲蕙芳。以愛國故構成獄訟。第二特區法院判以有期徒刑二月。緩刑二年。繼復引渡第一特區。亦經初審保釋。改期續審。先後營救者逹百餘團體。争具保狀者凡二百餘家。足見人心未死。公理未泯。本報前己詳論之矣。現惲案雖暫停頓。然己引起社會一般人熱烈之注意。有認此案爲法律與人情之閃爍者。有以此案爲［公意即法律］之明證者。有視此案爲公理。之表現者。説雖各異。要皆不外同情心之流露耳。夫司法有獨立之尊嚴。我人對於審判。自不宣妄行置喙。惟此案實爲法律根本問題之所繫不可不略論之。</p>
<p>第二特區之判决。二月之有期徒刑。不可謂不微。二年之緩刑。不可謂非救濟之道。惟妨害自由之罪名。己登於法院之記録。而無可洗刷。常人不察。將疑愛國亦有罪矣。第一特區之審判。雖令交保。改期續審。惟照案情之外表觀察。頗類繼續犯之性質。雖依據審判獨立之精神。一法院之判决。儘可不受他法院判决之拘束。將來結果如何。猶難臆測。但我人所欲言者。以斯案之中心。實爲純粹法律問題。並無法律與人情之衝突存乎其間。亦非［公理即法律］説之證明。蓋法律之園地。非如常人感想之若何枯寂無聊也。</p>
<p>按犯罪之認識。不僅以行爲之表面爲標準。亦當以行爲之内心爲依據。譬如戰争。將士殺敵致果。其殘酷實百倍於盜賊。乃將士有功而盜賊有罪。同爲殺戮之行爲。而將士則目爲英雄。盜賊則死有餘辜如殺人。正當防衛無罪。盜殺仇殺則有罪。是可知僅恃行爲之表面。不足以爲犯罪認識之準繩。惲蕙芳懷彈警人。在表面上固明明爲妨害自由。而可以構成第三百一十九條之罪名。然其動機爲抗日爲救國。救己救人。不啻爲刑法上之正當防衛。似可以亨受刑法第三十七條之不問規定。故僅就刑法本身之解釋與引用。惲蕙芳不無可原也。</p>
<p>其次法律之使命。在逹到其目的。目的爲何。德儒伊耶陵所謂［社會生命條件之保障］是也。保障之法無他。有消極。有積極。民法爲積極法。刑法爲消極法。是故刑法之目的。實在消除社會生命條件之障礙。惟社會生命之障礙。苟能用其他方法消除之初。亦無需乎刑法。是則刑法之應用。僅可爲保障社會生命之最後手段。按社會生命之條件。亦即近世法學家之所謂社會利益。［利益權衡］之審判原則。其行爲可以無罪。斯則不特歐之一般法學家所主張。尤爲美國法學家滂特氏所力倡者也。今惲蕙芳之行爲。直接爲警戒好商。勿進日貨。間接爲抗日救國。雖其行爲之影響。不免有妨害自由妨碍公安之意味。但其目的在圖謀國家民族之生存與延續。己爲國民意識所一致公認。</p>
<p>其意義之價值。實百倍於小我之自由。與一時一部份之公安。推其意志。與九路軍之奮起抗日。初無稍異。彼十九路軍之忠勇。爲萬家所頂祝。獨惲蕙之所爲。反將爲有司所不諒。揆諸常理。不平殊甚。况其行爲既合符法律之高目的。復可受審判原則之賜澤乎。</p>
<p>總之。法律之使命。在完成其保障社會之目的。而法律之内容。則不僅在數之條文。法律之淵源。千頭萬緒。如萬流朝宗。匯爲巨海。是故法律秩序之設。固不僅以死的條文爲唯一之基礎。法律家能深味法律意義之精髓。自可左右逢源而無阻。若惲蕙芳案其一例耳。</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚民賜黃馬褂  瞻廬黃馬褂是滿清時代繼絡王公大臣的東西：當時以爲非常榮寵，現在看了十分奇怪。聞説蒙古王公還没有醒這黃馬褂夢，中央政府投其所好，頒賜他們三十七件黃馬褂，寳劍贈與烈士，紅粉送與佳人，黃馬褂賜與蒙古人：不料欽賜黃馬褂後，又有這民賜黃馬褂。有人説：黃馬褂大有帝制臭味。我説：不對，帝制不帝制，在精神不在物質。從前看得很高貴的黃馬褂，到了現在，除却蒙古人，大抵看得很低賤，賞給他們黃馬褂，並没有十五分了不得。譬如從前念書人，拚着死命去博取一個起碼頂戴的銅頂兒。現在呢。贈給他正一品紅頂子，他也羞於頂戴。又如元朝的高帽兒，是戴在宰相頭上的，何等高貴？朱太祖打倒了胡元，把宰相的帽兒，賞給皂隸們，便是流傅至今的紅黑帽，大家又看得很抵賤了！業己失效的黃馬褂，也是這般，由着蒙古王公去出風頭，我們只算没有這麽一回事。蒙古王公肯穿黃馬褂，便是受了民國的籠絡，倒也可以稍安反側。如是我聞：穿黑馬褂的汛繫黨，既在世界抬頭：穿白馬褂的白俄，又是助紂爲虐：穿紅馬褂的共子共孫，依舊在内地活躍，最近又聽得有人要組織穿藍馬褂的棒喝團。唉！紅黃藍白黑的五色旗，己是片片裂：紅黃藍白黑的五色馬褂，却又互相輝映，這是值得我們驚異的！談談中國人的名字  郁雲賡中國人的名字。實在［名堂］大多了。除了正式的名和字之外。有幼時的乳名。有進學的學名。有宗譜的譜名。有死後的謚名。又有别名。别號。再有把籍貫和官銜。也當作名字。丨丨如黎黃陂。段合肥。柳柳州。杜工部等。我這裏所談的。却祇限於普通的名字。其餘的且待有空時再與諸君相見。普通一般人的名字。最多的便是［福］［禄］［壽］［祥］［慶］［興］等吉祥的字。其次便是［振乾］［炳坤］［鎭宇］［國樑］［人傑］等自誇的字。再其次的便是［子同］［守愚］［敬德］［永修］等謙冲的字。女子們的名字。因了歷代重視貞操道德和文人學士以花草珍寳贊美女子的結果。大多脱不了［貞］［芬］［翠］［玉］［琴］［寳］［娥：：：。近來有不少的摩登女子。喜歡用［瑪麗］［莉麗］［蓮娜］等外國名字。這個玩意兒。要算幾位女學生最高興。用古時認爲祥瑞的特出的動物名稱當做名字的也得多。如［騏］［驥］［驑］［驊］［麟］［鳳］［龍］［虎］等。眞可謂數見不鮮。［龜］在古代。本也被認作物之壽最長者。稱爲［四靈］之一。可是後來世俗竟用作詈人之詞。所以除了唐宋的李龜年陸龜蒙之外。很難得見到。不過東隣的日本人。却還是不少人喜歡用［龜］字做名字。江北同胞的小三子。小喜子。吉慶子。和浦東同鄉的阿猫。阿狗。阿大。阿二。阿妹（男的稱［雄阿妹］）等名字。可以説是最粗俗的了。不過實在講起來。他們這般同胞同鄉們。並不是喜歡這等名字。實在因了他們腦筋裏可題的名字。少得太可憐了。所以就馬馬虎虎地［小三子］［小喜子］［阿猫］［阿狗］亂呌了。利用現成的成語或連辭做名字。近來也不少。像戴天仇。張四維。嚴重。殷勤等。舉不勝舉。至於怪僻或滑稽的名字。古代早己有了。如漢代的程不識。雋不疑等便是。近年更是盛極一時。諸君如不信。可一查各游藝塲的節目表。一定可以找到許多［嘻嘻］［哈哈］［笑笑］一類的名字。有許多的新文學家。在發表作品的時候。往往喜歡用另外製造的假名來署名使讀者不易識破其眞面目。如魯迅·茅盾。巴金等幾個中間。没有一個是眞實的姓名。有些粗心大意的讀者。還把他們當做眞的呢。民衆同樂會記  爾强松江民衆教育館。於月之十二至十六日。舉行民衆同樂會於該館及體育塲。每晚七時起十時止。頗極一時之盛。開幕第四晚。余偕二三友人同往。及門見五彩牌樓高聳。莊嚴鮮艶。門内甬道。懸遍緑色圓燈。書［願君衛生。祝君康健］等標語。沿甬道至該館門前。有巨額曰健康廳。旁有聯曰。［身臨民教館］。士農工商。個個俱增常識。］［足踏健康廳。衣食行住。人人都要衛生。］四周圍以花邊。紥製頗精。廳内大禮堂布置爲花園式。堂中竹木成蔭。中有一橋。係利用温公廟之關橋改造。可謂想入非非。橋堍有聯曰。［任憑你有勢有財。平時不講衛生。今日休想行此路。］［須知你無方無藥。］萬事總求潔净。清心寡慾過斯橋］上有額曰長壽之橋。橋頂有亭。亭有門。門聯曰［同登壽域。共入康莊］橋旁柳枝低亞。橋上藤葛繚繞。間綴以五色小電燈。無缐電臺。即設於廳之樓上。清歌自花木間來。倍饒深趣。廳右設有警惕室五。每室有小孔四。使人就穴而窺。其四室佈置衣食住行四項衛生。最後一室爲不衛生的結果。内陳列一骷髏。及一屍體。燈光作幽緑。視之令人毛骨悚然。健康廳西爲樂園。園設於體育者塲。門前二方燈大逾數尺。樂園二字嵌於上。塲内分國技·籃球·遊藝·擲環·文虎·等數處。緑燈密佈。電炬通明。觀者尤衆。此會組織完備。規模宏大。然衛其人才與經費。實出人意外。該館職員僅七人。雖有縣黨部人員之恊助。亦不過十餘人耳。經費則以不出數十元爲度。其事甚難。其心則苦矣。蛋中蛋  沈枕月平湖東城外之禾豐農林塲。畜有母鷄一羣。約數十羽。中有一鷄。體肥胖而健。每日必至廁所竊食糞蟲。自月初起。日生一蛋。大似鵝卵。殻薄而有光澤。破其殻。除蛋白外。尚有一卵。大小形態。均如平常之鷄蛋。此種蛋中有蛋之奇。迄今己産十餘枚。該塲工人。互相争食。以爲可以補身。洵不多見也。姑誌之。以供研究。緑了芭蕉  徐浣花滬瀆囂塵十丈。不易窺見芭蕉顔色憶昔村居讀書。草屋外植蕉三數本。緑陰滿帷幄。隔絶暑氛。幾不知酷熱是何世界。兹則烈日焙窗炎威肆虐。舊夢追尋。渺不可即。爰摭拾往事。成芭蕉小史芭蕉榻蕉葉大者長四五尺。摘而下之。舗八臥榻。薦以竹枕。午盡觀書偶倦。即憇息其上。汗瀋無威。遽遽自足。其清凉勝舊多多。芭蕉露蕉葉間蓄收清露。昌瑩潔白。澈夜幾滿。每於侵晨趁日光未出時。即以玉質皿盌貯而下。積藏磁甕中。留供烹茗不時之需。色香味三者具足。且用此露水少許。逐日洗滌雙目。習久能使視官清明異常。蕉葉香書畫書畫以蕉葉代紙。寫罷復塗。塗罷又寫。腕底凉生。墨花泛緑。陶醉。性情。怡然自得。其經個人認爲較見工整者。則不更塗抺。留置几案。以待暇時之觀玩。迨秋風一起。彼則隨大自然而歸於毁滅。余亦視如流水浮雲。不復縈繫。此殆純求敵吾心境。而不足以語人者。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言靠牌頭吃飯  佛前天有兩個業社，因爲牌子的關係，大打其筆墨官司，天然，做生意牌子要緊，不能不拼命挣扎，這呌做靠商標的牌頭吃飯，因爲做生意，完全要靠牌子，牌子愈靈，生意愈好，</p>
<p>近日奸商，利用外來貨物，改頭換面，冒充國貨牌子，也拼命朝内地送，這種奸商惟利是圖，天良盡喪，煞是可恨，這也不能不呌做靠國貨的牌頭吃飯，據昨日報載，近有騙子朱姓者，化名五人，與其同黨陳姓張姓，在各處虚設洋行字號，至八家之多，地址牌號，歷歷可數，他門濫用支票，陸續向中外，各商業行號公司，騙取貨物，變價分肥，這呌做靠洋行牌頭吃飯，一面通電辭職，出洋留學，一面慫恿軍人，發電挽留，表示擁護，這樣一來，辭職儘管辭職，辦事儘管辦事，辭職之舉，天然打消，這呌做靠軍人的牌頭吃飯，所以在商界方面，因爲牌頭的關係，發生了許多事情，然而這種事情，總有方法來解决，惟政治方面，一罩牌頭，事態即形嚴重，惟這種牌頭，是否一路可以常罩下去，倒是一個問題呢文藝</p>
<p>感時  高夢雲問天無自首頻搔，偏我時艱滿目高，内患外憂應擊鼓，國愁家恨賦同袍，泉宫白鳳文章麗，湖海元龍志氣豪，竊愧壯心償未得，瀟瀟風雨讀離騷。</p>
<p>前題倒  月滿空庭讀楚騷，飄零湖海負才豪，欲書討賊陳琳檄，孰與寒時范叔袍，滿目瘡痍悲國難，傷心苛政使民蒿，魯陽愧乏揮戈術，翹企中原首自搔。科學棉織品和毛織品的辨别法  究竟毛織品怎樣？究竟棉織品是怎樣？我們要想精確的辨别，有下列三個方法：（一）我們取要試騐的織物一小塊，</p>
<p>放在玻璃試騐管中，再用苛性蘇打或氫氣化鈉溶液傾注在管中，然後拿玻璃管在酒精燈上加熱至相當時間，如果是毛織品，牠就完全溶解，棉織品，牠就不完全溶解（二）我們取試騐的織品，於顯微鏡下，可以看到彵的纖微管，如果牠的纖</p>
<p>微管的體面上是很光滑，就是棉織品。牠的纖織管的體面上和魚鱗一般，就是毛織品（三）我們取試騐的織品一小塊，加水和颜色品（如紅色墨水）煑熱，待冷時，然後再取顯微鏡去看，如果是棉織品牠的纖微管中没有色存在·如果是毛織品，牠的纖微管中吸收了顔色（這個最後的方法，衹限於未著色的織品有效·）改良社會討論會改良勞工生活案  禄增憑良心説話，我國對於勞工的待遇，似乎太苛刻了。以致影響到社會上，使生産落後的中國，不能振起精神，和舶來品争一日之短長，那是多麽的痛心呀！本會員服務於勞工界多年，深覺長此以往，恐至於不可收塲之時。爰將平日所想到的，分條述之如後·深望各會員同起討論改革，那末勞工界幸甚，也是社會的幸甚。提高勞工生活，一個勞工每天所得的工資，大約除去飯錢外，能夠得到二角左右，但是他們一樣有年老的慈母，幼小的子女，一切的開支，在在都期待着他所得的工資來維持，因此他雖然身在工塲作工，而心却在家中每天的費用，假使照這樣的工作看，那末請教怎樣能夠把出品做得美滿，所以我覺得提高勞工是急不待緩的了。使他們一些也不顧戀到家中的生活問題，一心一意的努</p>
<p>力着生産。那末直接的，廠中能夠較前得到多量的出産品，得能補失。間接的，社會上不使感到國産缺乏，或國産的貨賤。藉塞漏源，而厚民力。</p>
<p>增加勞工教育我國勞工的智識學識，大都淺薄得可憐。有了專門的技能，而不能利用學理來改良。使出産徒受損失，社會方面失却國貨購買力，故而我覺得工廠主面，一定需要着舉辦工人教育。大工廠獨辦一所，小工廠幾家合辦一所：利用業餘時間，授以普通智識，和技能增進法，技能改革法，使他們能手腦並用，這樣，那末我國將來的國産方面，定能欣欣直上哩！創辦勞工娱樂精神的休養，這是很重要的。我往往看見許多勞工，他們疲勞了一天，到晚上就去尋花問柳這也是精神上的休養，但是結果往往受梅毒身死，以至社會上少了一個生産者。故而我主張由廠方出資若干，創辦一勞工俱樂部，丨或幾家工廠合辦，請專員負責指導，使勞工在十分疲勞之後，仍能有相當的休養，藉以調劑精神上之痛苦。使他們工作合理化，娱樂科學化，那末對於業務上自然可以增加興趣，事業也自然易於發逹，社會也自然能夠安甯。保障勞工之健康，關於勞工的健康問題，是值得討論的，因爲勞工是做一天才能活一天，假使一旦不幸染疾，那末一家的生計當然要發生恐惶，即是廠方和社會上，都有受到相當的損失。所以我覺得廠方在事前，應當聘請名醫，每週檢騐一次，在事後，也應當代爲醫治，使早復健康，那末他個人，廠中，社會主面，都可以少一天的損失。上列四則，尚望諸會員不吝賜教。兩替秋季大廉價日師範學校學堂寫眞</p>

<p>［密司脱張，我告訴你］她似乎想把身體移近一下［這裏的待遇很不好，我擔任了五六年級的級任，每月僅二十五元，今年更欠了三個月的薪，暑假都放了，校長竟避面不見，聽説他但任了一家暑假學校的主任，密同脱張，你有相當的位子介紹嗎］？她俯着頭望我的回答。［像女士的才學，何必當一個小學教員呢？我近來也：：］［别騙人啊］，她不等我説完己喊了出來［許多朋友都説你做了新聞記者，一個交游廣闊的新聞記者介紹一個職業都不能嗎］？［不是這樣説，一時没有相當的位子罷了］。［密司脱張，你無論如何要留心着的，我現在不能回去，一走那校長更不管事了，現在他至少一天三餐飯食要備的，你有機會就寫信到這裏來吧］。我見她説話告了段落，就起身告辭，她也並不留我，却殷殷的送别。社會的一角風水先生  薔媛照例吃飩了夜飯都搬了凳子到門口乘風凉，隔壁鄰舍Ｃ君也老是來凑熱閙，還夾七夾八談談山海經，這天Ｃ君笑咪咪又來了，打量他彷彿帶着一件要告訴的事件一樣，果然，坐定了凳子就開口了：［這種眞是笑話，搬塲就搬塲好了，還要請什麽風水先生來看風水！］我就問他怎樣着一回事？是不是你們要搬塲？Ｃ君按着點點頭，隨即説：現在店址本嫌太小了，兼着近來因有某種關係的不便，所以决計要搬塲，房子是找到，方才竣工的新房子，本來要搬就搬好了，不料一位股東老闆曉得了，他想舊址還很順利，幾年來生意都做得曫好，不要搬了塲破了財氣，致資本家的囊不能充飽丨最好要呌位看風水的先生來看看，到底可以搬勿搬？這事當然誰都不敢阻止，雖則我們覺太無謂了！［今天飯後，果然同了一位所謂［風水先生］者來了，手裏拿了一只看得出風水好壞的［向盤］，興致淋漓的同去看新房子，東一瞧，西一瞧，説了些什麽［陽宅］哩，［陰宅］哩，好一回工夫，結果據説：大門太正了，這是［子午向］向，搬進去怕人口不太平，須要把大門改得偏歪一些，就可破了，並且還説，灶頭應如何打砌等等，總之胡言亂謅，我是懂都不懂，眼看那股東老闆興興頭頭迷花眼笑的神情，引得我暗暗的發笑，你想這種無稽的把戲，還算在知識界中人，也會去幹，可憐不可憐呢！］Ｃ君君有聲有色的説完了，我就笑着着説：［那末現在你們股東老闆放心了罷？你也不必去怪他多事了，他正是好心，怕你住新房子不順利呢！］Ｃ君没有回答，抿着嘴就回去了。後來我私自的想：這種正是社會的怪現狀，上海總算文明得透頂，不曉得還有這種迷信事，眞言之可慨！如果眞的看風水靈騐的，那末中國這樣的亂七八糟，不要也國民政府的居址或中山先生的陵墓方向不好吧？來函記者先生貴刋今日（八月十八日）家庭問題子偉的大文章完全抄録而來自瘦鵑主編之紫蘭花片（大東書局發行）第二十二集請將稿酬取消以爲抄襲他人文稿投送貴刊者戒王大華附上原文公布欄江蘇高等法院第二分院刑事判决金嘯園等因危害民國案金嘯園陳捲議鄭柳青謝銘退共同以危害民國爲目的而組織團體各處有期徒刑二年六月裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日傅單及關於含有反動意義之書籍均没收工部局訴徐大狗子因被告等販賣鴉片一案原判决撤銷徐大狗子孫興順共同連續輪鴉片各處有期徒刑一年併科罰二千元裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日刑事裁定周濂卿因危害民國嫌疑聲請停止覊押周濂卿着交保證金或保證書（舗保）一千元准予停止覊押祝李氏因被告祝永生侵占案着交保證金或保證書（舗保）五百元准將祝永生停止覊押民事判决顧榮榮與蘇嘉辛因借欵涉訟上訴案上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴負担陳德昌與張朱氏因存欵涉訟上訴案原判决關於利息起算日期之部分變更被上訴人賠償上訴人利息應自民國十八年二月五日起算上訴人之上訴駁回第三審訴訟書用由上譤人負担民事裁定孫梅生因與益昶號等定貨涉訟案抗告駁回抗告費用由抗告人負担孫明發與搿勞思因清償貨欵上訴案聲請駁回聲請人應於本裁定送逹之翌日起十四日以内補繳第二審審判費銀二百六十六元七角黃雲貞與洪生因離婚涉訟上訴案上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担（以上八月二十日）江蘇高等法院第三分院民事判决哈延慶與瑞華公司因請付房租及遷讓房屋涉訟提起上訴一案本院判决如左主文原判决關於假執行部分廢棄被上訴人在第一審就上開部分之聲請駁回上訴人其餘之上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担（八月十九日）上海第一特區地方法院刑事判决再核楊仰邃僞造貨幣案楊仰邃共同意圖供行使之用僞造通用之銀行劵處有期徒刑五年六月判决確定前在監日數以銀行刑期論張金陽搶奪累犯處有期徒刑六月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日陸長生搶奪累犯二罪每罪各處有期徒刑一年六月執行徒刑二年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日葉和尚無罪馬朱氏吸食鴉片一罪處有期徒刑三月併科罰金五十元趙銀福陳連生趙松濤錢大狗孫洪共同吸食鴉片一罪各處有期刑一月併科罰金二十元何馮氏陳氏吸食鴉片一罪各處有期徒刑刑一月裁判確定前覊押日數均准以二日抵徒刑一日潘龍生無罪杜文禮陳德友吴小吾窮盜各一罪各處有期徒刑徒刑四月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日米長生無罪李作文恐嚇未遂一罪處拘役二日談金生訴袁家奎搶奪案本件停止審判程序孫步雲訴徐李氏和誘嫌疑案徐李氏即朱李氏無罪朱正家收受贓物累犯處有期徒刑三月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日李阿福侵占遺失物處罰金十元緩刑二年王志福搶奪處有期徒刑三月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日周士成訴李文釗妨害自由案本件不受理劉新山訴王楚亭傷害案本件不受理施同富共同越進門牆及衣間侵入竊盜累犯兩罪每罪處有期徒刑一年六月執行徒刑二年六月田寳秋牙保贓物累犯有期徒刑十月裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日顧阿寳意圖營利以館舍供人吸食鴉片代用品一罪處有期徒刑六月併科罰金一百元薜和尚王阿根馮全福累犯吸食鴉片代用品一罪各處有期徒刑三月併科罰金五十元唐阿二沈春林殷會堂吸食鴉片代用品一罪各處有期徒刑一月併科罰金二十元裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日曹豹累犯意圖營利以館舍供人吸食鴉片處有期徒刑一年王福林累犯吸食鴉片處有期徒刑二月併科罰金四十元裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日曹陸氏薛吴氏無罪胡妙韓梅生僞證案本件不受理周陳氏竊盜處罰金二十元密勒對於公務員依法執行棧務時施强暴脅迫一罪處有期徒刑二月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日梁正培收買贓物一罪處罰金四百元奚林坤共同傷害人身體四罪各處有期徒刑二月執行徒刑五月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日吴阿杯訴蔡榮桂遺棄案本件管轄錯誤裘仁才李松亭共同結夥三人以上竊盜一罪各處有期徒刑一年裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日王雨松以竊盜爲常業累犯減處有期徒刑一年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日朱海關因詐欺案上訴案原判决撤銷朱海蘭詐欺取財一罪處有期徒刑六月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日徐張氏訴徐如文遺棄嫌疑案徐如文無罪趙阿友累犯夜間侵入竊盜未遂一罪處有期徒刑二年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日鑰匙一　除内一個應交還告訴人外餘没收李楊錢妹訴李和尚等妨害婚姻案本件不受理陳阿桂牙保贓物處有期徒刑二月周金元連續竊盜處有期徒刑一年裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日謝福壽無罪張夏氏夏日友王世空共同實施足以致死之方法傷害人一罪各處有期徒刑八月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日張夏氏缓刑二年張汝生等因賭博上訴案原判决關於張汝生即張許生裴湘林即白夏林罪刑部分撤銷張汝生即張許生裴湘林即白夏林共同賭博財物各處罰金二百元裁判確定前覊押日數以一日抵罰金二元何金玉傷害旁系尊親屬一罪處有期徒刑六月傷害人一罪處有期徒刑四月應執行有期徒刑八月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日張阿林李三共同侵占漂流物各處罰金三十元裁判確定前覊押日數以一日抵罰金一元木板一塊歸還失主顧肯夫與姚廷光因自訴及被訴妨害名譽上訴案原判决銷顧肯夫無罪姚廷光之上訴駁回民事批示戈家森與錢廷棟欠欵案請飭拘由狀悉准予拘案續追此批戈家森與許養由欠欵案請飭拘由狀悉准予拘案執行此批松記公司與傅榮慶欠租案請執行由狀悉候傅案追繳此批那姆生與李阿大欠欵案請執行由狀悉候傅案執行此批阮光明與徐國鈞等債務案請執行由狀悉候傅案執行此批許萬山與沈盛安仁飯金案聲請執行由狀悉候飭傅訊追此批格慶生與張阿金等欠欵案聲請銷案由狀由應准銷案并將顧阿桃開釋矣此批甘月松與三友堂欠欵案聲請標賣由狀悉候估價拍賣此批刑事批示應開忠請迅定期傅訊由狀悉查此案經胡吉生上訴卷宗尚未發回仰即知照勿瀆此批布告爲布告第二次減價拍賣事查本院執行債權人許周氏與債務人顧祥生因借疑訟一案業經將債務人所有後開不動産查封標賣在案現己逾期無人承買合行依照上次價額減去百分之十作爲最低價額兹定於八月十九日在本院設第七號匭投標九月三日開標凡居民人等欲買是項不動産者仰即遵期開具姓名年齡籍貫住址職業自願出價若干書具密函投入標匭届期依法開標以投標人中出價最高者爲得標人該得標人應於即日繳納標價定期五分之一餘欵於交産時一次繳足即由本院給予管業證書倘逾限不納即以投標人中出價次高者遞補仍照前開程序辦理仰居民人等一體知悉仰各利害關係人於開標之日一律到場母得自誤特此布告計開（一）拍賣之標的物則田（業户許行千）九分六厘七毫（二）物之所在地二十三保十三圖體字圩六百八十三號（三）最低價額銀元六千二百六十六元一角六分（四）閲看筆録之處所本院承發吏辦公室（五）領看人許周氏及本院執逹員王致祥公示送逹爲公示送逹事案查林陳氏林侯發因離異一案前因被告林侯發所在不明依照民事訴訟法第一百五十二條特爲公示送逹訂發判决正本一件右仰被告侯發知照（以上八月二十日）[P上海第二特區地方法院</p>

        <h1>1932.08.21</h1>
<h3>Legal Views on the Yun Case</h3>
<p>Yun Huifang, a young Shanghai man, was imprisoned for his patriotism. The Second Special District Court sentenced him to two months in prison, suspended for two years. He was then extradited to the First Special District, where he was also released on bail after a preliminary hearing, with a continued hearing rescheduled. Over a hundred organizations have been involved in his rescue, and more than two hundred have competed to provide bail bonds, showing that the people's hearts have not died and that justice has not been extinguished. This newspaper has already discussed it in detail. Although the Yun case is temporarily stalled, it has aroused widespread public attention. Some see this case as a clash between law and human sentiment, others see it as clear proof of "[public opinion is law]", and still others see it as a manifestation of justice. Although the opinions vary, they all express sympathy. The judiciary has independent dignity, and we should not recklessly interfere with trials. However, this case is related to fundamental legal issues and must be discussed briefly.</p>
<p>The Second Special District's verdict of two months' imprisonment cannot be considered harsh, and the two-year suspension of sentence cannot be considered a lack of relief. However, the charge of obstructing freedom has been recorded in the court records and cannot be erased. Uninformed people may suspect that patriotism is also a crime. The First Special District's trial, although ordering bail and rescheduling the hearing, appears to be a continuing offense based on the surface of the case. Although based on the spirit of judicial independence, the judgment of one court is not necessarily bound by the judgment of another court, and the future outcome is still difficult to predict. However, what we want to say is that the core of this case is a purely legal issue, and there is no conflict between law and human sentiment. It is also not proof of the "[justice is law]" theory. The realm of law is not as dull and boring as ordinary people imagine.</p>
<p>According to the recognition of crime, the standard should not only be the surface of the act but also the intention behind it. For example, in war, soldiers kill the enemy and achieve results. The cruelty is a hundred times greater than that of thieves, but soldiers are meritorious and thieves are guilty. Both are acts of killing, but soldiers are regarded as heroes, and thieves deserve more than death. As for murder, self-defense is not a crime, but robbery and revenge are crimes. It can be seen that relying solely on the surface of the act is not enough to be a criterion for recognizing crime. Yun Huifang carrying a bomb to warn people is clearly an obstruction of freedom on the surface and can constitute a crime under Article 319. However, her motive was to resist Japan and save the country, saving herself and others, which is no different from legitimate defense under criminal law. It seems that she can enjoy the provisions of Article 37 of the Criminal Law, which does not inquire into the motive. Therefore, based solely on the interpretation and application of the criminal law itself, Yun Huifang is not without justification.</p>
<p>Secondly, the mission of law is to achieve its purpose. What is the purpose? The German scholar Ihering called it "[the protection of the conditions of social life]". There are no other methods of protection, both negative and positive. Civil law is a positive law, and criminal law is a negative law. Therefore, the purpose of criminal law is to eliminate obstacles to the conditions of social life. However, if obstacles to social life can be eliminated by other methods, there is no need for criminal law. Therefore, the application of criminal law can only be the last resort to protect social life. The conditions of social life are also what modern jurists call social interests. The principle of judging by "[balancing interests]" means that the act can be innocent. This is not only advocated by European jurists in general but also strongly advocated by the American jurist Pound. Now, Yun Huifang's actions are directly aimed at warning good merchants not to buy Japanese goods and indirectly at resisting Japan and saving the country. Although the impact of her actions inevitably has the implication of obstructing freedom and hindering public safety, her purpose is to seek the survival and continuation of the nation and the country, which has been unanimously recognized by national consciousness.</p>
<p>The value of its significance is a hundred times greater than the freedom of the individual and the public security of a temporary part. Extrapolating her will, it is no different from the rise of the 19th Route Army to resist Japan. The loyalty and bravery of the 19th Route Army is praised by thousands of families. However, Yun Hui's actions are misunderstood by the authorities. Judging from common sense, this is extremely unfair. Moreover, her actions are in line with the high purpose of the law and can be blessed by the principles of judgment.</p>
<p>In short, the mission of law is to fulfill its purpose of protecting society, and the content of law is not only in the articles and provisions. The source of law has thousands of threads, like thousands of streams flowing towards the sea to form a giant ocean. Therefore, the establishment of legal order is not only based on dead articles. If jurists can deeply understand the essence of the meaning of law, they can be resourceful and unhindered. The Yun Huifang case is one example.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Jiang Asks Zhang Xueliang to Act as Chairman of the Military Commission Branch, It Is Said that Jiang Bocheng, a Standing Committee Member, Will Act on His Behalf, Zhang Xueliang Hopes That All Generals Will Not Make Any Remarks</h3>
<p>Beiping, Jiang telegraphed Zhang Qun and Jiang Bocheng yesterday to forward the message to Zhang Xueliang, requesting Zhang to act on his behalf as chairman of the Military Commission and of its branch, in order to preside over the affairs of the branch in Ping. Jiang Zhang has already forwarded this telegram to Zhang, but Zhang has not yet made any response. (Special telegram from the 20th)</p>
<p>Beiping, Zhang Xueliang convened a meeting of generals last night, hoping that they would not make any more remarks. At that time, a certain general advocated sending another telegram, detailing the truth about the Northeast's switch of allegiance in the 17th year [1928] and the Northeast's stance in the Sino-Russian war in the 18th year [1929], so that the people of the country could understand the attitude of the Northeast. Zhang dissuaded him again to avoid complications. (Special telegram from the 20th)</p>
<p>Beiping, Rong Zhen is scheduled to convene a meeting of Northeast generals on the 20th to explain the process of establishing the Ping branch of the Military Commission. (Special telegram from the 20th)</p>
<p>Beiping, Yu Xuezhong and Wang Shuchang separately ordered their subordinates to expedite the completion of preparations. As soon as the telegram arrives in Ping, they will take office immediately. There have been some changes in the departments of the Hebei Provincial Government, but the candidates have not been finalized. Gu Jijiun recommended Qu Shiying as the secretary-general, and it is said that it has been decided internally. There have been only minor adjustments to the defense areas of the First and Second Armies. (Special telegram from the 20th)</p>
<p>Beiping, Bao Wenwei telegraphed Ping, forwarding the message to Zhang Xueliang, requesting that he carefully consider the duties of the Military Commission and other positions. (Special telegram from the 20th) Nanjing, regarding the organizational law of the Ping branch of the Military Commission, Zhu Peide has drafted it and taken it to Guling to present it to Jiang for review. The content, in addition to being subordinate to the Military Commission and subject to its command, is roughly the same as the Military Commission in other organizations. Since Jiang cannot go north to preside over the meeting in the near future, Jiang Bocheng, a standing committee member, will act as chairman. This organizational law can be passed as soon as Jun Wang and others return to Nanjing. The association can be established next month. (Special telegram from the 20th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, since the Central Government approved Zhang Xueliang's resignation, in addition to sending a telegram to Zhang to persuade him to stay, Song Zheyuan and other generals in North China also telegraphed Jiang at the same time, stating that the security of North China was of great importance. At a time when foreign insults were pressing, once the military commander was changed, it was feared that unexpected difficulties would arise, and he should be asked to withdraw the order. Jiang telegraphed Zhang to dispel his intention to go abroad. Since the armies in North China had been under Zhang's command for a long time and the generals had telegraphed their support, he should take them into consideration. Regarding the military affairs of the North, Zhang could still participate in the name of the Central Military Commission. This matter is being discussed in Guling and will be decided soon. (Special telegram from the 20th)</p>
<p>Beiping, Zhang Xueliang's passport and those of his entourage to leave the country have been sent to this place from Nanjing. It is still questionable whether they will be used. Zhang still holds the ambition to travel abroad. It is said that the temporary residence in the Summer Palace has been arranged. However, the movement to keep Zhang in Beiping is gaining momentum day by day. The students from the three northeastern provinces in Beiping are also petitioning to keep Zhang. Judging from the news published in the Chinese newspapers, Zhang's determination to go abroad is not as firm as before. It is said that the question of staying or leaving will depend entirely on the future orders of the central government. (Reuters telegram from the 20th)</p>

<p>Berlin, the Berlin ["Exchange Postal Newspaper"] recently commented on the Japanese government's agreement with the Manchurian government, saying, "[Japan has achieved its goal]. [Japan wants to turn Manchuria into Korea II during a period when general public opinion is not paying much attention. The similarities between the Korean incident and the Manchurian incident are very obvious. Japan's invasion of Korea also always maintained the prosperity of Korea, and it is now adopting the same method in Manchuria. Although only a few people believe that Japan's goal is only to economically protect its developed rich land and does not want to completely rule Manchuria politically, let alone formally regard it as a colony, because from a climatic point of view, Manchuria is not suitable for the Japanese people, etc. However, Japan has achieved its goal]." (Telegram from the 20th by Havas Agency)</p>

<h3>British and Canadian Agreements Signed</h3>
<p>British newspapers claim the Ottawa Conference was a complete success.</p>
<p>The British Imperial Economic Conference closed yesterday.</p>
<p>Britain also signed agreements with India, South Africa, and others.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 19th - The British delegation attending the Imperial Economic Conference was very busy this morning, as the conference is nearing its final stage. The British representatives signed agreements with India, South Africa, and Newfoundland, and carefully reviewed the wording of agreements with Australia, New Zealand, and Southern Rhodesia in preparation for signing. By noon, most of the work was completed. Negotiations between Britain and Canada continued, and in the afternoon, British and Canadian representatives initialed the agreements, with the official signing scheduled for tomorrow (Saturday). All parties consider the outcome of the conference a complete success.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 19th - According to sources in Southern Ireland, British Dominions Secretary Thomas and Southern Irish representative O'Kelly have reached a tentative agreement during their discussions here. If this agreement is established, Britain and Ireland will mutually abolish tariffs, and the two sides can then proceed in a good atmosphere to select arbitrators to resolve the land annuity issue that has caused a deadlock between the two countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 20th - This morning, most London newspapers declared the Ottawa Conference a complete success. Following the establishment of agreements between the Dominions, British and Canadian representatives initialed the agreements between the two countries yesterday afternoon, which is widely regarded as extremely gratifying. The Times stated that the matter has been successfully resolved based on the opening speeches of Baldwin and Bennett, achieving the common goal of reducing tariff barriers within the Empire and expanding imperial trade. The conference, in less than a month, has halted the trend of economic isolation among the various parts of the Empire. The Conservative Party's Morning Post and the Daily Telegraph are also very satisfied. The Morning Post pointed out that the Ottawa Conference has opened a new era for British trade. Liberal and Labour newspapers are less satisfied. The Daily Express reported that the conference ended without much excitement, merely increasing the domestic prices for British consumers. The Exchange Telegraph Company reported that the resolutions of the conference failed to remove the obstacles that created the current global situation. The British representatives only achieved imperial unity by sacrificing British foreign trade. The representatives at Ottawa were busy throughout the night preparing for the plenary session this morning, at which the agreements will be formally signed, and Baldwin will present a silver platter to Canadian Prime Minister Bennett on behalf of the conference. Important events decided yesterday included the British granting wheat a preference of two shillings and restrictions on the import of foreign flour into Britain. It is expected that only principles will be announced today, while tariff changes will be kept confidential until they are submitted to Parliament for approval. The First Committee unanimously decided: (1) Imperial governments should investigate the issue of Dominion satisfaction as soon as possible. (2) The conference recognizes that export subsidies and low exchange rates diminish the value of tariff preferences within the Empire, and therefore hopes that prices will rise and exchange rates stabilize so that subsidies and special taxes can be abolished immediately.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 17th - The Secretary of State for the Dominions, Thomas, currently in Ottawa, recently delivered a speech via radio, transmitted to the wireless exhibition here. Thomas stated, "The success of the Ottawa Conference is beyond doubt. The agreements we are about to conclude will benefit the Empire without harming foreign countries."</p>
<p>Havas, Ottawa, 20th - The British and Canadian agreements were not initialed until 1:45 AM this morning. The British and Canadian representatives discussed the agreements until late at night in order to finalize them. At 10:00 AM today, the British Imperial Conference held a plenary session in the Canadian House of Commons, where representatives signed the agreements and made brief speeches. The conference then declared its closure. Havas, Ottawa, 19th - The agreement between the British and Indian delegations has been signed. Havas, Ottawa, 19th - On the eve of the conclusion of the Ottawa Imperial Conference, various delegations are finalizing the agreements they have negotiated. According to Canadian sources, the agreements signed tonight by the British and Canadian delegations will provide many benefits for Canadian livestock and wheat exports to Britain.</p>
<p>Havas, Ottawa, 19th - The British and Canadian agreements will be established today. The closing ceremony of the Imperial Conference is scheduled for 10:00 AM on Saturday. It is also said that agreements between Britain and several other Dominions will be established tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Agence Nationale, Ottawa, 19th - Today, the Australian delegation announced that the British-Australian trade agreement has finally been negotiated and initialed by both parties. Agreements between Britain and India, South Africa, and Newfoundland have also been signed.</p>
<h3>Piccard's High-Altitude Testing Results</h3>
<p>Confirm that cosmic ray intensity increases with altitude.</p>
<p>Agence Nationale, Milan, 19th - It has now been confirmed that the highest point reached by Piccard's balloon was 16,770 meters. Although the instruments were damaged upon landing, the records are intact. Piccard told reporters that he and Cosyns are planning a third ascent off the coast of Hudson Bay in Canada, near the magnetic pole, which will undoubtedly solve many scientific problems. This ascent confirmed that the intensity of cosmic rays increases with altitude, which is the opposite of the results obtained by Professor Regener, who used rubber balloons to carry instruments into the stratosphere some time ago.</p>
<p>Havas, Desenzano, Italy, 19th - At noon today, Professor Piccard, in a meeting with international press representatives, expressed his deep gratitude to Belgium, because Belgium had provided significant funds to help him manufacture the balloon and conduct various tests before the aerial voyage. The professor deeply praised the great assistance provided by this small country. The professor also said that the results of this aerial test were better than the last because the launch site of the balloon, the Dübendorf airfield, was in a very good location, avoiding all strong winds, allowing the balloon to rise slowly, thus facilitating all scientific calculations and inspections. In 1931, when the professor and Kipfer made their first aerial test, the balloon reached an altitude of 1,500 meters above sea level in 28 minutes. Yesterday, Professor Piccard and Cosyns, although flying to a height of 1,600 meters, had a very clear aerial view due to the slow ascent of the balloon, and the ground features were as vivid as paintings. Moreover, windows were opened on both sides of the balloon's gondola this time, unlike the simple round hole used in the gondola in 1931. The professor proved that the intensity of cosmic rays increases significantly in the thin atmosphere. The professor also said that Cosyns will make an important announcement on this matter. Before meeting with the press representatives, Professor Piccard discussed the transport of the balloon with aviator General Di Grigoli. The professor was then greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd on the hotel's platform, as crowds clamored to see him outside the hotel. The entire city was decorated with flags, and slogans such as "Long live Piccard, long live Cosyns" were plastered everywhere.</p>
<p>Agence Nationale, Milan, 20th - Professor Piccard's assistant, Dr. Cosyns, has left Desenzano for Zurich. Piccard will remain for another two or three days.</p>
<h3>Uchida Advocates a Far Eastern Monroe Doctrine</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th - Foreign Minister Uchida's draft diplomatic speech to the extraordinary session of the Diet will be deliberated and decided at today's Cabinet meeting. It is reported that the draft is quite long, breaking previous records, and the speech is scheduled to last approximately one hour. The main focus of the speech will be a detailed account of diplomatic matters following the establishment of Manchukuo, along with mentions of meetings and negotiations with the Lytton Commission, the progress of the Disarmament Conference, the current state of Soviet relations, and other matters. Regarding the maintenance of peace in the Far East, he will strongly argue that China, Japan, and Manchukuo must strengthen their national power and maintain friendly relations, and advocate a kind of Eastern Monroe Doctrine, emphasizing that Far Eastern issues should be handled by Far Eastern countries. He will then criticize the incompetence of the League of Nations' Lytton Commission.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Denies Japan-Russia Agreement</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th - The Foreign Ministry today officially denied reports of a new agreement between Japan and Russia centered on the recognition of Manchukuo. However, the long-standing dispute over fishing rights has taken a sudden turn for the better. General observation suggests that even if not formally, some form of understanding may have been reached.</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in the Japanese Exchange Rate, Ministry of Finance Adopts Laissez-faire Attitude</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th - Regarding the sharp drop in the yen's exchange rate, while Parliamentary Vice-Minister Horikiri of the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the issue and advocates establishing an exchange rate stabilization fund to cope with it, Minister of Finance Takahashi and his leadership are exceptionally calm and intend to let it run its course naturally. The reason is that the immediate cause of the yen's decline is the dumping of the yen by the Shanghai gang, while the fundamental cause lies in the Manchurian Incident and social unrest. However, social unrest can be gradually eliminated through measures to rectify the situation, and public sentiment will stabilize. However, the adverse effects of the inflationary monetary policy cannot be avoided. From this attitude, it can be seen that the Ministry of Finance has no intention of submitting an exchange rate policy proposal to the extraordinary session of the Diet.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th - The yen's exchange rate has been plummeting for days, and the future is unpredictable. The Seiyukai party attaches great importance to this matter. As a result of studying countermeasures, they believe that an exchange rate stabilization fund system should be established first, followed by an import control law. They have advised the government and submitted a budget proposal for the extraordinary session of the Diet yesterday afternoon. Yesterday afternoon, a top-level executive of the Seiyukai party also urged Minister of Finance Takahashi to implement it. The Minister of Finance replied that the Ministry of Finance had already drafted a specific proposal, but it had not yet been decided by the Ministry due to opposition from the Bank of Japan. Currently, the government is considering first advising the government to submit an exchange rate countermeasure proposal to the extraordinary session of the Diet. If this cannot be done, they plan to submit it independently as a party and are currently preparing it.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 20th - The Financial Times editorialized on the recent depreciation of the yen, stating that the yen's depreciation within a certain range has encouraged Japanese exports, but if it continues for too long, it will inevitably lead to danger. As for the reasons for the yen's depreciation, the newspaper said that it should not only be attributed to the general public's excessive purchases in advance to prevent raw material prices from rising. There are two main reasons: first, the excessive budget deficit; second, the instability of the political situation. The impact of political instability on currency has been evident in other countries. The newspaper also said that whether to take an unnatural approach to prevent the yen from continuing to depreciate at this time should be considered by the Governor of the Bank of Japan. However, the Governor of the Bank of Japan believes that balancing the budget and restoring credit can naturally achieve this goal without the need to adopt unnatural methods.</p>
<h3>Britain Currently Not Considering Further Discussions on Disarmament with the United States</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 19th - Due to the continuous transmission of news from domestic and foreign media regarding the upcoming naval conference and the British-American consultations on naval issues, the relevant authorities declared that Britain is currently not considering such issues at all.</p>
<h3>Tenth Anniversary of the Baku Oilfields</h3>
<p>TASS, Baku, 20th - Baku, the most important oil region in the Soviet Union, is currently celebrating one of the most important anniversaries in its history of development. Ten years ago, the seawater of the Bay of Bailov was drained here, creating the best and richest oilfield in the Baku region. What was once the Bay of Bailov now has 650 oil wells, which have produced 9 million tons of oil in the past ten years, all of the best quality.</p>

<h3>The Fate of the Papen Cabinet</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 19th - The biggest political issue in Germany at the moment is the fate of the Papen cabinet when the new Reichstag convenes. People in the cabinet appear optimistic and confident that they can last for four years, but outsiders, except for Hugenberg, do not believe this. The National Socialist Party said that the foundation of the cabinet is like being built on sand, and it does not represent any force other than itself and Hindenburg. However, the representation of Hindenburg cannot be ignored. The Social Democratic Party said that the current cabinet does not have sufficient authority to conduct beneficial negotiations with foreign countries. The National Socialist Party has the same opinion. The hostile behavior of the Communist Party is very fierce, which is very obvious. It is also heard that behind the scenes of the negotiations, the Centre Party is attacking the cabinet very strongly, and its actions are very dangerous. The Centre Party aims to avoid military dictatorship and restore the normal rules of the constitution. Therefore, it is trying to unite with the National Socialist Party through the Prussian incident and oppose its common political enemy (referring to the current cabinet). The National Socialist Party and the Centre Party can largely unite with each other, with the National Party taking the lead and being supervised by the Centre Party. In this way, the federal government has failed in the federal parliament and has lost a position in Prussia. Faced with this situation, Papen may either give way or hold a coup d'état. However, a coup d'état is not approved by Hindenburg. It is rumored that the compromise between the Centre Party and the National Socialist Party can force Hindenburg to hand over power to Hitler. When the situation reaches this point, Hindenburg on the one hand has the constitutional obligation to fulfill, and on the other hand, his personal will does not want to authorize Hitler, so the outcome may be that he resigns himself, and the deposed Crown Prince succeeds him as president. However, judging from Hindenburg's personal character, such a retreat seems incredible. In short, Hitler forms a cabinet, the Centre Party agrees to it, and the Reichswehr will also support it. This kind of speculation is not entirely unbelievable, but at the moment, it is just a speculation.</p>
<h3>German Government's Unemployment Relief Plan</h3>
<p>Agence Nationale, Berlin, 19th - The government's unemployment relief plan has been discussed in recent days by Minister of Finance Krosigk and Deutsche Bank President Luther. Today, the cabinet reviewed it again. According to semi-official sources, the government and the Deutsche Bank previously had greatly differing opinions on raising funds to implement this plan. After recent discussions, they have gradually converged. The original plan required an expenditure of 335 million marks, but it is now acknowledged that this is not enough to cover the costs. Because there are more than 5 million unemployed people, if the atmosphere in the labor sector is to improve, at least 1 million people must be found jobs. In that case, the required expenditure would be 500 million marks. It is hoped that for the sake of the German economy's future, the government and the Deutsche Bank will be able to reach an agreement. As for the situation among the various parties, there has been no substantial development. Regarding the issue of the Catholic Centre Party and the National Socialist Party forming a coalition government in Prussia, the two sides have held preliminary talks, but no formal negotiations have been conducted yet. The National Socialist Party has not sent representatives to the Prussian parliament. The party leader in charge of this negotiation, Kubel, has gone to Munich to meet with Hitler and has just returned.</p>
<h3>Austrian Federal Council Rejects International Major Loan</h3>
<p>Agence Nationale, Vienna, 19th - The Austrian government is once again in a difficult position. As expected by the political circles, today the Federal Council rejected the International Major Loan Agreement by a vote of 22 to 27. The National Socialist Party and the Greater German People's Party were among those who opposed it. The Christian Social Party and the Farmers' Party voted in favor. Before the vote, the two sides debated fiercely. The Austrian government now intends to submit the bill to Parliament again for a vote, in order to overturn the Federal Council's rejection. However, when it was passed by Parliament yesterday, it was only by one vote. At present, the number of people opposing the political conditions of this loan is increasing daily. It is doubtful whether the government can win in a second vote.</p>
<p>Agence Nationale, Berlin, 19th - The French newspaper Le Temps reported that the opposition to the International Major Loan Agreement in the Austrian Parliament was instigated by Germany. The majority of the opposition was ordered by Berlin, and the German government was interfering in Austrian internal affairs. The German government was greatly angered by this report and found its slander ridiculous. It believed that the agreement restricted the Austrian people's right to self-determination for many years. Even if the majority of the Austrian government supported it, it was only accepting it reluctantly for the sake of temporary convenience in order to save the financial chaos. The French newspaper's claim that this action was to protect Austrian interests and prevent it from being controlled by the Pan-German movement was also absurd, because the Pan-German movement was voluntary on the part of the Austrians, and 90% of the Austrian people supported merging with the German homeland.</p>
<h3>U.S. Chief of Staff General MacArthur to Tour Neighboring Countries of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 19th - U.S. Chief of Staff General MacArthur's upcoming tour of neighboring countries of the Soviet Union has attracted great attention from the Soviet Union and Poland. The issue of U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union is being discussed extensively. Regarding this matter, U.S. Secretary of State and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov conducted negotiations this spring. At that time, the U.S. authorities wanted to make the abolition of the Third International a condition for recognition, which Litvinov deemed unacceptable.</p>
<h3>American Cash No Longer Flowing Out</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th - American cash is no longer flowing out, and the authorities are considering whether to use the future World Economic Conference as an opportunity for international measures to prevent large-scale capital outflows. According to President Hoover's calculations, the total amount of American capital outflows exceeds 240 million yuan, of which 100 million yuan is cash.</p>
<p>Agence Nationale, Washington, 19th - Today, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that the value of gold imported into the United States from abroad from July 15 to last week totaled $41,000,000. The total amount of gold reserves in the United States is currently $4,046,000,000, compared to only $3,917,000,000 two months ago. Although the number of gold withdrawals from abroad in the United States recently is large and not a period of abundance, it has increased by nearly 100 million yuan compared to 1921, which shows that gold is gathered and not dispersed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the United States Returns Home</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th - Japanese Ambassador Debuchi has left Washington and returned to Tokyo. Before leaving, he told people that if Japan and the United States have any differences of opinion regarding Manchuria, he hopes to mediate them.</p>
<h3>German Government Decides to Negotiate with Britain and France to Revise the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 19th - According to reliable sources, the German government has decided to instruct its ambassadors to Britain and France to negotiate with the foreign ministries of the two countries on the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. It is heard that the reason given by Germany is that German public opinion is eagerly awaiting this matter and it should not be kept waiting for a long time.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 19th - Regarding Germany's intention to discuss the reorganization of the federal army with the British and French governments, the official statement is that no notification has been received from the German government.</p>
<h3>Death of Former Austrian Prime Minister Schober</h3>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 19th - Former Austrian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dr. Schober passed away at 10:00 PM tonight.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 20th - Former Federal Chancellor Schober passed away at 10:00 PM last night in Gutenbrunn, Lower Austria. Schober was born on November 14, 1874, in Perg, Upper Austria. In June 1918, Schober was appointed as the Vienna Police Chief. In November 1918, the republican government was established, and he was appointed as the Capital Police Commissioner. On June 21, 1921, Schober first served as Federal Chancellor and Foreign Minister until May 1922. During his tenure, he personally drafted the Treaty of Nice, dealt with the Burgenland territory between Austria and Hungary, and signed the Treaty of Lana with the Czechoslovakian representatives. After this treaty was rejected by the Greater German Party, Schober resigned from the cabinet and continued to serve as Police Commissioner until September 1922. He formed a cabinet for the second time and served as Federal Chancellor until September 1930. During this period, Schober tried to revise the Austrian constitution and represented Austria at the Hague Conference, where he secured Austria's exemption from reparations. From 1930 in the Ender Cabinet and 1931 in the Buresch Cabinet, Schober served as Foreign Minister and, as Foreign Minister, jointly drafted the German-Austrian Customs Union draft agreement with former German Foreign Minister Curtius in March 1931. In January 1932, Schober resigned due to heart disease and gradually withdrew from the political arena, eventually succumbing to it.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Discovers New Islands</h3>

<h3>Soviet Union Railway Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 19th - The issue of constructing a railway through the Caucasus Mountains has been discussed for half a century and is now close to being resolved. Its construction plan is being drafted. It is currently being studied to build an electrified railway between the Dargavs and Goen stations. Dargavs station is in the northern Caucasus, while Goen is a station on the Transcaucasian railway line. Once this line is completed, it will be the largest electric railway in the world. Up to now, transportation between Transcaucasia and the north has relied on the railway passing through Baku. With the success of the new plan, transportation here can shorten the distance by 1,000 kilometers, and transportation costs will also be reduced to 50 million rubles. The construction project is scheduled to be completed in 1936. The area through which the railway passes is rich in metal mineral resources, especially copper deposits.</p>
<h3>Women's Endurance Flight New Record</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 20th - Female aviator Mrs. Marcelis and Mrs. Harden took off in an airplane here on August 14 for an endurance flight. They have now broken the previous women's endurance flight record (122 hours and 50 minutes). According to a wireless message sent by Marcelis on Tuesday, she has pain on one side of her cheek. The doctor at the airfield diagnosed it as appendicitis and urged Marcelis to land immediately for treatment, but Marcelis ignored it and continued flying as before. Her plane has been refueled several times and is still soaring in the skies here.</p>
<h3>British Aviator Mollison Flies the Atlantic</h3>
<p>Reuters, St. John's, Newfoundland, 19th – British aviator Mollison safely flew across the Atlantic, landing at Benfield Ridge in New Brunswick. This afternoon, his plane flew over Nova Scotia, having completed its westward journey three hours ahead of schedule. Mollison's achievement is one of the major events in aviation history, as he is the first to fly solo across the Atlantic from east to west, and also the first to fly a light aircraft across the Atlantic. Mollison landed about 55 miles from St. John's at 11:45 AM, which is 5:45 PM British Summer Time. Mollison flew 2,440 miles from Porthmadog to Halifax in a total of 24 hours and 10 minutes, but lost his way due to heavy fog upon reaching the coast. When he landed, he still had enough fuel to fly directly to New York, but Mollison was extremely tired and unable to continue. He spent six hours in the sky after reaching the coast before landing the plane. The crowd rushed to greet him. Mollison said, "I originally hoped to fly directly to New York, but I couldn't continue when I got here. The weather was unfavorable for the last 18 hours, and I flew in the clouds." Mollison still needs to fly 600 miles to reach New York, and will probably depart tomorrow morning (i.e., Saturday morning). Mollison trusts the Moth light aircraft very much. Before departing, he claimed that the main purpose of this trip was to show the excellence of British light aircraft. Mrs. Mollison, also known as Miss Amy Johnson, was overjoyed in London after receiving the news of the successful Atlantic crossing, saying, "I knew he could do it! I am overjoyed beyond words. Tonight, I plan to go to the theater and have a small gathering with friends to celebrate." After landing, Mollison first sent a telegram to his wife, and then accepted a cup of tea offered by a farmer, drinking it but refusing food. Because he had only eaten barley sugar and occasionally drunk a little brandy in the air, his stomach had been empty for a long time, and he dared not eat solid food immediately to avoid adverse effects. The British Air Minister has sent a telegram to congratulate him. When Mollison set off, he originally hoped to make a round trip across the Atlantic in three or four days, but he has now changed his plan. It is rumored that he plans to wait in New York for his wife to come to America by ship, at which time the couple may fly back to England from west to east together, which is unknown.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 20th – Mollison plans to fly to New York at 10:00 AM (3:00 PM British time).</p>
<p>National News Agency, Montreal, 19th – British aviator Mollison will fly here on Saturday to attend the opening ceremony of the aviation exhibition, and then fly from here to New York on Sunday, where a grand welcome is being prepared.</p>
<h3>Spanish Peasants' Riot</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 19th – A major disturbance occurred today in the small town of Lettes in the province of Zaragoza, Spain. A group of collectivists led a team of peasants, and when the municipal council was in session, they invaded the town hall. In the conflict, the mayor and another person were killed, and one municipal councilor and one security team member were seriously injured. The authorities have sent troops to suppress the riot.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Tianjin Telegram: All newspaper offices, please note: Ji Qing's previous departure from the customs was previously reported by telegram. For three months, he traveled around all the garrisons of our army and witnessed the grief and indignation of the people and the high morale of the soldiers. All were of one mind and vowed to fight to the death against the enemy. Fortunately, the strong sense of national righteousness still exists. From now on, let it be promoted and carried forward to eliminate the reverse atmosphere and restore the lost land. It is not difficult to hold the winning ticket. However, it is regrettable that the salaries and equipment are lacking, and there is no supply at all. Although there is a will to perish with the sun, there is a concern that it will be difficult for successors to follow. Immediately, we pacified and comforted to stabilize the military's morale, and rushed back to Beijing and Shanghai to report the details of the inspection. Thanks to our fathers and brothers from all walks of life, who share the same hatred for the enemy, some misguidedly urged us on and held welcome meetings, while others generously donated materials and money. Encouraged by all parties, we became more and more motivated. Moreover, now that Rehe is under alarm and Tianjin and Beijing are in danger, it is even more urgent to seize the enemy's opportunity first. Ji Qing has dedicated himself to the country and dares not take a moment of leisure. He has now left the customs again to lead the entire army in active struggle, setting a deadline to drive the Japanese pirates out of the country and return our rivers and mountains. The equipment, ammunition, and funds donated have been distributed separately. All the three armies worship and receive them, and all cheer, willing to devote their loyalty to destroy this powerful enemy. The subsequent progress will be reported later. Military letters are flying everywhere, and there is no end to what I want to say. I will briefly express my humble sincerity and hope for your public understanding. Zhu Jiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army, kowtows for deletion. (This telegram was sent from the front and telegraphed from Tianjin)</p>

About 600 people, including all staff members and guests from various agencies, attended. Ju Zheng presided over the ceremony, and after leading the ceremony, he reported on Mr. Liao's deeds and contributions to the Party, saying that Liao was a model for the Party's comrades. The Premier consulted with him on everything, big and small. Liao's contribution to the Party's foundation today is not small. Liao was good at financial management and successively held important financial positions, making the poor government's arrangements ample. Liao was extremely diligent and still studied while dealing with Party and government affairs. When he served as the Party representative of the Whampoa Military Academy, he still taught classes in his spare time. He was very gentle and all comrades respected and feared him. If anyone had any opinions, he always explained them so as not to cause disputes. Now there are many disputes in the Party. If Liao were here, this would not happen, etc. The meeting then adjourned (20th).</p>
<h3>Military Police Department Abolishes the Regulations on Rewards for Seizing Opium</h3>
<p>Separate Regulations on Awards for Meritorious Service Promulgated</p>
<p>Military Police Officer Training Institute to Open</p>
<p>The military police are in charge of military police, and also manage ordinary administrative and judicial police. Therefore, the opium item in the crackdown on contraband originally belonged to the scope of their duties. However, such cases are now increasing day by day, and the traffickers are not only ignorant common people, so they have been jealous of all parties, and have even been attacked from non-difficulties. Recently, there have even been slanderous reports to the Military Commission. Seeing this situation, the leaders of the Military Police Headquarters have long planned to withdraw from management, but</p>
<p>Rewards have been awarded for seizing opium, and lower-level cadres are currently lacking salaries. They can supplement their lives with bonuses, and they are happy to search and it is extremely difficult to ask them to give up. Now, the front line is tense in suppressing the bandits, and the rear is important for security. The duties of the military police are more burdensome, and it is difficult to delay them with such trivial matters. Therefore, the Military Police Department initiated a meeting of all officers yesterday, and decided that from today onwards: (1) It is strictly forbidden for consultants to deal with non-military smoking cases. Violators will be punished as disobeying orders. (2) If others report that active-duty soldiers have committed smoking cases, they must be caught with both the person and the stolen goods, and temporarily ask the superiors for instructions on how to handle them. (3) If the police voluntarily request the military police to assist in cracking down on smoking cases, although it is inconvenient to refuse, it is absolutely not allowed to intervene and must be reported immediately. If they privately accept rewards, they will also be punished as disobeying orders and sentenced to death. (4) Discharged officers and soldiers, if they dare to impersonate to investigate smoking cases, or harbor or privately sell opium, they will be sentenced to death once discovered, and the informer will be heavily rewarded. The above is all to focus on serving military police duties, eliminate social misunderstandings, and clarify intentions. As for the regulations on rewards for seizing opium, they will be abolished immediately, and separate regulations on awards for meritorious service in serving military police duties will be promulgated to guide the military police on the right path. It is also reported that reports and letters have been submitted for promulgation. The capital's military police have been reduced and merged into five regiments since this spring. In order to popularize military police education, the Military Commission and the Ministry of Military Administration approved the establishment of a separate Military Police Training Corps (old site of the 34th Battalion of Huapai Tower), with Commander Gu serving concurrently as the head of the corps. It adopts the latest modern organization and recruits junior and senior elementary school graduates to serve as candidate superior soldiers, and recruits military police specialists from the country to serve as cadres and instructors. They are currently actively training. It is now reported that the leaders of the Military Police Headquarters, in order to popularize military police academics and various legal and social knowledge to all military police officers (from regimental attachés to battalion commanders to platoon leaders), so that they can perform military police duties and increase their ability to educate soldiers, will set up a Military Police Officer Training Institute at the headquarters. However, considering the duties, they will be summoned in rotation, divided into three types of students, A, B, and C, each divided into two phases, which will take about nine months to complete in rotation. It is now reported that the planning has been completed, and the first phase of Type A students (regimental attachés and battalion commander level) can begin classes no later than October 1st.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul in Tianjin Protests Boycott of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Various Trade Associations Hold Meetings Not to Sell Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Ota, and Vice-Consul Goto, accompanied by a translator, visited Wang Shuchang, Chairman of Hebei Provincial Government, at the provincial government at 4:00 PM yesterday (17th). Wang was away in Ping, so Secretary-General Liu Shanqi received them. Ota first said that there were too many rioters in Tianjin, which had endangered the security of the Japanese Concession, and asked whether the Chinese authorities had the ability to stop them. Liu replied that the security of Tianjin was maintained by the police and military police, which was quite effective, and there were no so-called many rioters. Ota also said that a bomb occurred at the Zhongyuan Company on the afternoon of the 14th, and bombs occurred at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Chongqing Cloth Village on the morning of the 16th. This was obviously done by anti-Japanese rioters, and he asked the Chairman of the Province to pay close attention, take effective measures to stop them quickly, and maintain the previous promise to continue to ban the movement to boycott Japanese goods, otherwise it would endanger security, worsen Sino-Japanese relations, and cause major disputes, and the Chinese government should bear all responsibility, etc. Liu replied that he could not accept what the Consul was talking about. A person's love for their country is like loving their own home. No country in the world would stop its people from loving their country. How could our country be unique? However, acts that obstruct security are a violation of the law, and the local police and military police have been ordered to take strict precautions. If there are any more bombings that endanger security in the future, they will be severely punished once they are caught, and no leniency will be given. Hearing this, Ota showed displeasure and still demanded that the boycott of Japanese goods be banned. Liu finally replied that he would pass it on to the Chairman when he returned to Tianjin for verification and handling. Ota and Goto then left. It is reported that the Japanese ambassador will still submit a written protest.</p>
<p>The local Marine Products, General Merchandise, Paper, and Bicycle Trade Associations have received instructions from the Chamber of Commerce to inform all Japanese goods merchants to quickly end their Japanese goods sales to avoid unfortunate incidents. In addition to sending letters to comply with the time limit, an emergency general meeting of all trade associations was convened at 4:00 PM yesterday, attended by more than 30 people. The chairman read the incoming documents and made a heartfelt speech, saying that the country is now in danger, the neighboring enemies are tyrannical, and economic resistance is the most effective struggle for our merchants to save the country. Although doing business is for profit, how can we forget righteousness for profit and cause the country to perish? Since last year's severe crackdown on enemy goods in this city, this association has repeatedly given the most sincere guidance and encouragement. Now, North China is still not immune to the satire of [inferior goods selling well], which makes patriotic people angry and gives them warnings. Judging from the actions of merchants, although there is no intention to destroy the country, the crime of destroying the country is difficult to escape. Thinking of this, I feel deeply guilty and sincerely hope that all merchants will arouse their conscience, rise up to the spirit of saving the country, and make a decision now, it is not too late, etc. Subsequently, representatives of various trade associations spoke one after another, saying that legitimate businesses in the trade associations had already withdrawn their Osaka trading posts and did not purchase Japanese goods. Although the people who attended the meeting today are merchants, they are confident that their patriotism is no less than others. Who would be so insane as to repeat the same mistakes? Having heard the chairman's words, we should strive harder and abide by the agreement, and we will never be spurned by the world. As for unscrupulous merchants who are not in the trade associations and have no legitimate businesses, who take the opportunity to operate and pass off fish eyes for pearls, we also hope that they will be severely punished. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The Tianxiang Market of the French Concession's Industrial Promotion Commercial Market, starting yesterday, all the shops in the two markets posted announcements in various newspapers, stating that all inferior goods have now been sealed up and will no longer be sold. In addition, the Paint and Pigment Trade Association, Longshun Cotton Cloth Yarn Shop, etc., have also published announcements. (August 18th)</p>
<h3>Administrative Inspector Commissioners to be Established in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui</h3>
<p>Serving Concurrently as Security Commanders to Achieve the Effect of Consolidating Power</p>
<p>Hubei to be Divided into Ten Zones to Implement First, Personnel Selection in Progress</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chiang Kai-shek, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, believes that during the period of bandit suppression, politics and military affairs must be given equal importance. However, the distance between provinces and counties makes it difficult to supervise both superiors and subordinates. Therefore, it was decided to establish Administrative Inspector Commissioners in the three provinces, serving concurrently as Security Commanders and also serving concurrently as the magistrates of the localities, presiding over both military and civilian affairs. This has the advantage of unifying the powers of the former Qing Dynasty's military preparation circuit, and avoids the shortcomings of the early Republic of China's Tao Yin system of accumulating official documents. The organizational regulations of the Commissioner's Office have been drafted and issued to the three provincial governments on the 19th, and instructions have been issued explaining the significance of creating this new system. It is reported that Hubei Province will be divided into ten zones for implementation first, and personnel selection is in progress. Henan and Anhui provinces will continue to be divided into zones for establishment.</p>

<p>Southern Jiangxi Bandits in the North</p>
<p>Bandit Army Crumbles and Reorganizes</p>
<p>Guangdong and Jiangxi Armies Divide into Three Routes to Recapture Anyuan</p>
<p>Blockade of Bandit Areas Economically Achieves Great Results</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the Red Bandits Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao, Zhao Pusheng, and Dong Zhentang withdrew from Xinfeng, they dispersed and occupied Anyuan, Xunwu, Huichang, Yudu, and the east bank of the Ganjiang River south of Ganzhou. Due to prolonged battles, fatigue, and lack of salaries and ammunition, there has been no action. According to a bandit's bulletin searched by a certain division on the front line, the puppet Central Committee and Military Commission in Ruijin, with the original First (Zhu De) (unspecified), Third (Peng Dehuai), Fourth) (Li Mingrui), and Fifth (Ji Zhentong) Army Groups, suffered many casualties after the battles of Ganzhou, Guidong, Rucheng, Nankang, Dayu, and Nanxiong. Special instructions were issued to reduce the number of army groups to armies, that is, the First Army Group was reduced to the First Army, the Third Army Group was changed to the Second Army, the Second Group was changed to the Third Army, the First Army, the Fifteenth Army, and the Ninth Army were combined into the Fourth Army, the Tenth Army was changed to the Fifth Army, the Luobinghui Two Armies in Western Fujian and the First Army in Eastern Guangdong were changed to the Sixth Army, and Li Mingrui's Seventh Army remained the same. The above notice was signed by Xiang Ying, Chairman of the Puppet Military Commission, and Vice-Chairmen Zhu De and Mao Zedong, which is considered credible. According to Ganzhou News, the Red Bandits are also reorganizing in the Huichang Yudu area. Yudu, Xingguo, and Ruijin have been completely banditized, and traffic has been cut off. After Anyuan, Huichang, Xunwu, and Sannan were occupied by the bandits, they are like foreign lands, and it is impossible to get accurate news. Bandits come out at night and hide in the mountains and villages, and it is difficult to know the truth even with aircraft reconnaissance. However, there are more than 10,000 bandits with about 6,000 or 7,000 guns in the area east of Ganzhou, including Dabu, Changluo, Maodian, Xiashan, and Xikeng. They are confronting the 18th Army of Ganzhou and the Ye Luo troops, and plan to cross the Ganjiang River in sections from the east bank of Ganzhou to cut off traffic from Ji'an to Ganzhou and from Ganzhou to Dayu. Zhou Zhirou, Luo Zhuoying, Wang Maode, and Wu Qiwu's divisions are also blocking them in sections to prevent the bandits from breaking through and fleeing west when the Fujian and Guangdong armies attack. The Ganjiang armies are using this natural moat to defend against the advance of the Fujian and Guangdong armies, to prevent the bandits from breaking through and fleeing west again. After the Guangdong army convened a military meeting in Nanxiong, the military situation became tense. It is reported that the general plan is to have Xiang Hanping's Second Column and the Miao Peinan, Zhang Da, and Li Han, souls Divisions as the central route, attacking the front of Anyuan from Xinfeng Anxi. Li Yangjing is the right wing, attacking the south of Anyuan via Heping and Sannan, and contacting the Fujian army to guard Xunwu to prevent the bandits from fleeing to Pingyuan and Jiaoling. Yu Hanmou's First and Second Divisions and Chen Cheng's Fourteenth (Zhou Zhirou) and Fifty-second (Li Ming) Divisions are the left wing. In addition to guarding Dayu, Nankang, and Ganzhou to maintain traffic from Ganzhou to Nanxiong, and suppressing the scattered bandits in Chongyi and Shangyou, a part is also used to attack the back of Xinfeng from Huilong between Nankang and Xinfeng, and the south of Ganzhou's Wangmudud, to prevent the bandits from fleeing north to Yudu and Ganzhou. It is also reported that the above troops are all advancing from their destinations. The Zhou and Li Divisions on the left wing have captured Wangfu, which is the northern part of Anyuan. The central and right routes are also not far from Anyuan. If the bandits do not retreat, there will be fierce battles in the coming days. In addition, our army's economic blockade of the bandit areas has been effective. The garrisons in Ganzhou, Ji'an, Nanfeng, and other places have unanimously and strictly prohibited the inflow of oil, salt, rice, cloth, kerosene, medicines, and daily necessities into the bandit areas. Those who smuggle them will be punished as collaborating with the bandits. Red bandits often use women and disguised refugees to pass through our army's defense lines to buy oil and salt for the bandits. However, since the traffic has been cut off, no one can pass through, so oil, salt, and daily necessities in the so-called Soviet areas of the Red Bandits, such as Xingguo, Yongfeng, Guangchang, Shicheng, Ruijin, Ningdu, Yudu, Xunwu, Anguo, and Huichang, have long been cut off. The worst hit are Yudu, Xingguo, and Ruijin counties. Oil and salt are sold for one yuan per catty, and even if you offer one yuan and several horns, you can't buy them. The refugees who have not escaped from the bandit area cannot survive and cannot die. Their suffering is beyond description. (August 18th)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Bandit Suppression in Western Anhui</h3>
<p>Xu Tingyao's Troops Capture Key Locations in Southern Huoqiu</p>
<p>Wang Jun's Troops Cross the Pi River and Defeat the Red Bandits</p>
<p>Liang Guanying's Troops Prepare to Straightforwardly Attack the Bandit Nest</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Since the National Army launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression of the Red Bandits in Western Anhui, they have suffered great setbacks. The third step of the encirclement and suppression plan has been launched simultaneously by various armies, and the armies of Henan and Hubei provinces have also been mobilized. Therefore, it is hoped that the bandits can be completely suppressed this time. The Fourth Division of the First Column of the Right Route Army of the Bandit Suppression Army, led by Xu Tingyao, after recovering Huoqiu last month, has recovered places such as Zhangjiaji and Chaluokou in Southern Huoqiu. The Independent 40th Brigade of the Independent 40th Brigade under his command, led by Song Shike, has also captured key passes in the Sanliuji area. After this major setback, the Red Bandits mobilized two puppet independent divisions and the remnants of the 75th Division of the 25th Puppet Army, and retreated to Hekouji, (this market is in the southwest of Huoqiu, east of Dabie Mountain. Passing Dabie Mountain is the territory of Gushi County, Henan) Duguangji, Changtangshao (two places in</p>
<p>East of the Pi River) Xiadianzi, (south of Huoqiu) and the temple of Gu County at the junction of Liu'an and Huoqiu, to resist stubbornly. The bandits gathered thousands of Red Guards to support them. The entire Fourth Division and the Independent 40th Brigade launched attacks on the bandit areas from the 10th of this month. The next day, the Fourth Division successively occupied Hekouji, Duguangji, Changtangshao, and Xiadianzi. The 40th Brigade also occupied Guxiansi. The combat power of the Bandit Suppression Army was extremely fierce this time, and they fought hand-to-hand with the bandits several times. The bandits suffered about 2,000 casualties. The Bandit Suppression Army also suffered some casualties. The entire Seventh Regiment of the Puppet Independent Third Division of the Red Bandits was wiped out by Song Brigade, and countless war trophies were seized. They are still attacking. On the Liu'an side south of Huoqiu, Wang Jun's troops of the Third Army recently crossed the Pi River for the second time and completely defeated most of the Red Bandits occupying the southwest highlands of Danyinbu and the Guandigeng area, capturing many prisoners. They are now engaged in suppressing the bandits and pacifying the refugees. However, the west bank of the Pi River to the mountains is devastated by the Red Bandits, and the local area has suffered greatly. All the villages and towns have become ruins, and there are no people in hundreds of miles. The weeds are more than ten feet deep, and it is very difficult to find a place to camp wherever the army goes. Wang Jun recently transferred the 34th Brigade of the 12th Division under Ma Kun, stationed in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, to Hefei to join the Bandit Suppression sequence and attack westward in order to thoroughly suppress the bandits. The troops of the brigade concentrated in Linzhun the day before yesterday and marched on foot to Hefei. Ma Kun took the No. 201 Pukou Express train south from Bengbu at 2:00 AM this morning (19th). After arriving in Pukou, he took a ship to Wuhu, and then transferred to a small ship to Hefei. The brigade headquarters and special service officers and soldiers took a military train to Linhuai in the rain at 7:00 AM, led by Deputy Brigade Commander Cun Xingqi. Once they arrive, they will transfer to Hefei. A small number of officers and soldiers are still left here to guard. The 32nd Division of the 25th Route Army, led by Liang Guanying, originally stationed in Hefei, has recently arrived in Shucheng to prepare for bandit suppression and to form a liaison with the Third Army. The special party department of the division, considering that the army is about to attack the bandit nest, organized a front-line work team for the convenience of work, with Wen Zhigang and Wang Zhaoshou serving as deputy directors, and set off for the front line to handle all political propaganda matters.

<h3>Disputes Over Xiang Security Commander's Arrest and Detention of Reporter</h3>
<p>征寅</p>
<p>Outrage from All Sides Over Reporter Li's Unjust Imprisonment</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Last week, the Changsha Pili Daily published a report stating that several American sailors rented rooms at the Oriental Hotel outside Daxi Gate, brought in prostitutes, engaged in public nude sexual acts, and ordered the hotel staff to buy a young boy, about eleven or twelve years old, to lie naked in bed with the prostitutes and pretend to engage in sexual acts while the sailors watched and laughed. This was considered a matter of human ethics and public morals, and it was hoped that the authorities would punish the hotel manager, staff, and local prostitutes who profited from this. Hu Da, the Security Commander of Changsha, the provincial capital, paid close attention to the report and immediately ordered the police station in the western district to investigate and report back. However, the local military and police were protecting the Oriental Hotel and claimed that nothing of the sort had happened. The contributor, to avoid trouble, corrected the report in the Pili Daily, stating that the information was inaccurate and that nothing had occurred. It was hoped that the matter could be resolved, but Commander Hu Da was determined to investigate the matter thoroughly and sent personnel to inquire with the Pili Daily about the source of the news. The Pili Daily stated that the original article was submitted by Li Shao, a reporter from the Cuixiang News Agency, and handed Li Shao over to the Security Command, where he was confronted with Jia Shi'an, the manager of the Oriental Hotel, and Hu Liantang, the hotel staff. Jia and Hu denied that the sailors had been allowed to engage in public sexual acts. Reporter Li stated that he had obtained the information from rumors and could not provide concrete evidence. Hu then detained Reporter Li, the Oriental Hotel manager, and the hotel staff. Two days later, Officer Gong of the Western District Police Station confirmed that the incident had occurred. The prostitutes who had sexual relations with the sailors were Zhao Jinhua and Wu Chaoping, and the prostitute who had public sexual relations with the child was Ju Qing. It was also confirmed that the child was Li Ronghua, the son of boatman Li Guo'an. They were arrested one by one on the sixteenth and sent to the Security Command for interrogation. The prostitutes confessed that the Oriental Hotel staff had introduced them, and that each of them received ten dollars, with the brothel taking seven dollars and the prostitutes receiving only three dollars. Li Ronghua, the child, stated that he was eleven years old and that one afternoon an American soldier came to the boat, carried him to the Oriental Hotel, took him to a room on the third floor, and told him what to do. After he got out of bed, the American soldier asked the hotel staff to bring him a bowl of noodles and gave him a dollar. At this point, the case became clear, and Commander Hu Da immediately released news reporter Li Shao and detained the Oriental Hotel manager, hotel staff, and prostitutes involved in the case, preparing to handle them severely. As a result, this case attracted serious attention from the Changsha press. It was believed that the Security Command, with dozens of intelligence and detective personnel, had failed to discover the case in advance, which was dereliction of duty. After the newspaper published the report, and it could not be proven to be completely fabricated, the arbitrary detention of a news reporter was illegal. Because the matter concerned the entire body of reporters, many advocated petitioning the government to remove and punish Hu Da and to ask the provincial government to protect the news industry. At the same time, the Changsha newspapers criticized the Pili Daily for handing over the contributor without following legal procedures, setting a bad precedent for the Changsha press and being too subservient to the Security Command. As a result, a major dispute arose. Upon hearing the news, Commander Hu invited the committee members of the Changsha Press Association, including Ling Daru, Chen Jieshi, Huang Xingyi, Du Yiwu, Chen Yangting, and Luo Xinbing, as well as many other important figures in the press, to a banquet at Wanlichun Western Restaurant at 5 p.m. on the seventeenth to ease the situation. Li Shao, the reporter from Cuixiang News Agency, who was unjustly imprisoned for three days before being released, also invited all his colleagues in the press to the Zhongshan Road Public Tea Garden at 7 p.m. on the seventeenth to report on his experience of being imprisoned and to seek justice. Those present were extremely indignant and decided on two things: (1) The Cuixiang News Agency should petition the Municipal Press Association to forward the petition to the government to remove and punish Hu Da and to protect news reporters. (2) All news agencies should stop submitting articles to the Pili Daily, which had handed over the contributing reporter, and not cooperate with it. In addition, the Changsha Press Association scheduled a meeting of the Executive Committee on the twenty-third to discuss the matter. However, it was heard that some people from the Municipal Press Association were mediating, so the dispute might not escalate. (August 18)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing's Three Declarations</h3>
<p>Second Declaration of the Northeast National Salvation Army to Save the Nation: The Chinese people, known throughout the world for their love of peace, have seen voices of armed resistance throughout the country since the September 18th Incident last year. In particular, the tens of thousands of comrades in our army, under violent control, have endured hardship and have been beheaded and sacrificed, advancing one after another, vowing to fight a long-term struggle and not caring about huge sacrifices. Is this a violation of the national character? The Japanese warlords' absurd actions in the Northeast are unprecedented in the history of civilized humanity. Their fierce and arrogant temperaments cannot be influenced by humility and courtesy. As Western philosophers have said, "The world only respects blood and iron." This is why all the comrades of our army have been bearing arms and moving forward without looking back. Since the beginning of the formation of our army, we have revealed our creed and announced it to the public. Now, the Japanese disaster is deepening, and conspiracies are emerging. Thinking of the brewing storms, our hearts and lungs are tense. We dare to express our sincerity again and make public our army's overall attitude towards this matter. (1) Our army wants to tell the people of the whole country that war is the opposite of peace, but the current situation in our country is such that peace cannot be achieved without war. This is caused by the atrocities of the Japanese warlords. The words of Tanaka, the former prime minister and leader of the Japanese warlords, were: "To conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia; to conquer the world, we must first conquer China." This shows how great their ambition is. The acts of aggression since September 18th are the first step in this ambition. Since the appearance of the puppet state of Manchuria, they have been proceeding step by step and sparing no effort. Recently, they newly established a plenipotentiary ambassador stationed in Manchuria, concurrently serving as the commander of the Kwantung Army and the head of the Kwantung Government, and regulating the South Manchuria Railway to correct the long-standing drawbacks of the four-headed politics. This is the most vicious of plans. From now on, the power will be unified, and the puppet can be manipulated more freely, and postal rights and customs rights will be swept away. Now, the second Korean farce is being played. If there is no fierce resistance, Manchuria will be formally included in the Japanese map, and it is only a matter of time. If Manchuria is conquered, Mongolia will follow. If Manchuria and Mongolia are conquered, the whole of China will follow. The vast land of Yu will become a Shura field for the Japanese pirates to run rampant. Where is there a clean land for our people to talk about peace? Moreover, Jehol is now sounding the alarm again. Peiping and Tientsin are being watched, and it is within their intentions. Their desires are endless. At present, the only way is to carry out a continuous armed struggle in the Northeast to completely overthrow the situation created by the Japanese warlords, so that the Japanese warlords, who are drooling over the fat piece of meat that is Manchuria, feel as if they are swallowing a bomb that is difficult to swallow. Then they will have no spare time to conquer Mongolia, and conquering the whole of China will become a dream. If the situation gradually becomes clear and the momentum declines, and the Japanese iron cavalry completely disappear between the Changbai Mountains and the Black River, then our people's long-cherished wish for peace can be studied calmly. Therefore, the only way for our country to achieve peace at present is war. Our army returns the fire of machine guns and artillery to the Japanese bandits, which can be regarded as the bell of peace for the country. (2) Our army wants to tell the Japanese people that the purpose of our army's elimination is the Japanese warlords, not to be enemies with the entire Japanese people, and that it is deeply beneficial to the entire Japanese people. This time, the Japanese warlords trampled on the Northeast with eloquent words. According to their description of the rich and fertile situation in the Northeast, it seemed that if it was included in the scope, the economic problems of the island country would be immediately solved. Now, they have occupied the Northeast for nearly a year, and the effect is as elusive as catching the wind. The reward they have received is the financial deficit, the trade lock, the sharp increase in the number of unemployed, and the active instability. The left-leaning ideology has been growing secretly, and the hidden dangers are even deeper. If the Sino-Japanese dispute continues for years and still does not end, the internal state of Japan is just as Confucius said: "The worries of the Ji Sun family are not in Zhuanyu, but within the walls of Xiao." Therefore, the foolish act of the Japanese warlords in disrupting the Northeast not only harms China's peace, but also harms its own country's peace. The entire Japanese people have no power to escape the yoke given by the warlords, and they are eager to get rid of them, but they can only sigh. In the future, when our army's campaign is successful and the Japanese warlords collapse, everything in Japan can be restored to its original state, and all dangers can be prevented. All the tombs that the Japanese warlords have dug for their own country are simply leveled by our army. Therefore, our army's current arduous progress is not only beneficial to the Chinese nation, but also beneficial to the Yamato nation. There is no shortage of people on the islands of Japan who understand the truth. If they think of our army's lonely and painstaking efforts, they will only smile at each other and be in perfect agreement. (3) Our army wants to tell the people of all countries in the world that our army's armed struggle against Japan is to remove obstacles to world peace. We sincerely do not want to hide the fact that the state of world peace is now in a state of constant shaking. Precisely because of this, preventing and maintaining it is the common responsibility of all mankind. The Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the Geneva League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the disarmament conferences held in recent years, regardless of their actual effectiveness, all express mankind's responsibility for peace. However, the Japanese warlords not only despise this responsibility, but also take pleasure in destroying it. The Battle of the Northeast completely destroyed the foundation of peace in the world. Their fabricated puppet state reading is a delusion, which is an unforgivable crime against human morality. If the Japanese warlords want to seize the Northeast, they can just seize it. As for national self-determination, it is the source of human peace. Do the Japanese warlords have no conscience? How can they bear to take advantage of their private plans and recklessly slander it? If this trend continues, the good name of national self-determination will become a shortcut for the strong to steal. If the Japanese warlords intend to seize India in the future, they can create a self-determined Indian state at any time. If they intend to seize Vietnam, they can create a self-determined Vietnamese state at any time. If they intend to seize the Philippines, they can create a self-determined Philippine state at any time. If they intend to seize Siberia, they can create a self-determined Siberian state at any time. The flood will be rampant without end. Our army will step forward with righteousness and will not give way. We will ask about the Kwantung tripod and prevent future disasters. Our cotton strength is self-conscious, and our suffering is shared. We can also tell the 1.6 billion compatriots on the globe that we are innocent. In short, our army's current actions are fierce war actions. We are determined to destroy the court and sweep the caves, and there is no room for complacency and compromise. Our army's ultimate goal is a perfect peace goal. The day when the Japanese invaders disappear is the day when our army withdraws its troops. Our purpose is clear, and heaven and earth can be sworn. From now on, we will follow this path and serve it with Zhou Xuan. If the stone rots and the sea dries up, this ambition will not change. This is our declaration. We, the Chinese people who are lying on firewood and tasting gall, the Japanese people who are oppressed by the warlord's iron hooves, and the people of the world who care about the future of peace, will witness it together.</p>
<h3>Soviet Government Issues Bonds in the United States</h3>
<p>According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, a New York Evening World telegram from Moscow states that the Soviet Russian government plans to issue bonds in New York to seek to import foreign capital. These bonds have a fixed reserve as a basis, with a term of ten years and a guarantee of interest. The president of the American International Trade Bank is currently in Russia investigating various situations, and the American government has expressed a warm welcome to the Soviet Russian bond issuance plan. If its foundation is solid, it will be allowed to raise the amount of debt in private banks. According to various observations, the United States' demands on Soviet Russia seem to have been properly negotiated. Therefore, the governments of Russia and the United States are getting closer and closer, and it will not be long before the United States recognizes Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>Inhuman Wife-Killing Case: A'e, the younger sister of Pan Zhenhai, a villager of Panjiating Village, in the eleventh map of the twelfth district of this county, married Hua Apin, a villager of Yahu Beach in Jinshan County, last year. The relationship was still harmonious, but the brother was resentful of the mother-in-law, who usually helped her son to abuse his wife. A'e did not dare to argue. On June 21st of this year, she returned from her mother's house after taking a summer break. For some unknown reason, she was suddenly stabbed to death by her husband, Apin, with sharp scissors in the middle of the night. There were many knife wounds on the upper body, and blood splattered on the ridge beam. His mother-in-law was only separated by a board wall in her bedroom, and did not warn or stop him when she heard the sound, which was much criticised by the villagers. After the township police reported it, it was inspected by Jinshan County. The inspection found that the deceased's lower body and genitals were cut to pieces, with many wounds, which was inhuman. The murderer was arrested and detained by the county government, confessed after being interrogated, and the bloody clothes were kept on file. Now, the original plaintiff has requested an appeal, and the Jinshan County government has set the 22nd for a continuation of the court hearing.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Preparations for Suppressing Lake Bandits: Dai Yue, the brigade commander of the 36th Brigade of the Army stationed in Jiaxing, plans to join the water and land military police of nine counties, including Wuxian, Wujiang, Qingpu, and Wuxi, to suppress the accumulated bandits in Taihu Lake. He is currently sending personnel to contact the counties for joint suppression. Shen Wei, the director of the Third District of the Water Public Security Bureau and concurrently the director of the Second District, sent a special letter to Brigade Commander Dai yesterday, stating that in order to suppress the lake bandits, a policy of eradicating the root and blocking the source should be adopted. First, in Yangshan in Puzhang and Jinze Zhanglintang in Jinpu, investigate the giant and cunning families, strictly punish them according to the law, and then the bandits will have no place to hide, and the suppression will be easier. In the past, it was common to see bandit suppression officers setting up various titles such as detectives, guides, and inspectors, opening the door of fortune for giant and cunning families. Some even used these as a pretext to exploit the villagers. The bandit suppression team had a day to open the door, but the giant and cunning families had many claws and had already received the news, which was of no benefit to the future of bandit suppression.</p>
<p>Retention of the Resignation of the Heads of the Defense Regiments: The heads of the defense regiments in each township and district of Wuxian have submitted a joint request to the County Defense Committee for resignation because of the order from the County Street Defense Committee to divide the funds for the defense regiments in each township and district into five levels of A, B, C, D, and E, and reduce the original amount by about 30%. The heads of the regiments believe that it is impossible to allocate the funds and have asked the County Defense Committee to send personnel to take over as soon as possible. According to the report, Chairman Zou of the County Defense Committee immediately issued an order to earnestly retain them, as it was closely related to local security, and that the funding problem would be discussed again.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>The Party Department Dispute is Becoming More Serious: The Taicang County Party Department has been reported to the provincial government by various commercial firms and district party departments for embezzling fines from the anti-Japanese association and donations for flood and horse relief. The previous news has been recorded. It is now learned that the executive committee of the county party department has not sent the routine expenses for six months to the supervisory committee for review, which is considered to be a violation of the law and a cover-up. More than 70 party members from various district branches have jointly reported to the provincial government. On one hand, the district party branches have sent letters to the county government, the finance bureau, and the property management office. The situation of the normal party affairs expenses is becoming more and more serious. The general assembly of county representatives was originally scheduled to be held on September 1st. Before the dispute is resolved, it is feared that it will be difficult to convene. In addition, some party members, in view of the small number of party members in the county and the repeated reductions in party affairs expenses, have put forward opinions in order to resolve the current dispute, requesting the provincial government to change the Taicang County Party Department into a district party department directly under the province and send personnel to reorganize it.</p>
<p>Mutual Verification of Murder for Profit Case: Zhu Xiqiu, the eldest son of Zhu Zuoren, a soybean cake merchant outside Nanmen, went to Chaoyangmen on the 22nd of last month to collect accounts, totaling about 400 dollars in banknotes. When he arrived at Xinmu Bridge, he was suddenly intercepted by bandits who robbed all the banknotes and killed the victim. The murderer fled without a trace. Zhu Zuoren ordered people to search everywhere after his eldest son went missing, but there was no information. It was not until yesterday that someone reported that there was a corpse laid out in the Xinmu Bridge field. After receiving the news, Zuoren went to identify it and found that it was indeed his son, but he had been dead for a month, the flesh and bones were separated, and it was badly decayed. He immediately reported it to the county government. Wu Cheng, the examiner, has scheduled to go to the countryside for mutual verification today (the 19th).</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Seizes Large Amount of Opium: According to a secret report, Guo Jinnan, who lives in Zixiang Lane and runs a clock shop, also sells opium. Upon receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately went to the address and found more than 480 taels of opium in Guo Jinpu's bedroom. Guo's wife, Zhang, was arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Joint Request for Public Xing to Compensate for War Damage Losses: Tan Yunqing, Pan Shun, Zhang Buyou, and others, pawn customers of Lou Tang Xiecheng Pawnshop, stated that during the war, the pawnshop transported the pawned items to other places. After local order was restored, they claimed that they were lost after being robbed during transportation, and because it was an extraordinary event, they were not responsible for compensation. As a result, the customers were only able to receive six cents of silver for items that were worth one dollar at the time of the pawn. They set up a Xiecheng pawnshop registration office in the Zhong Temple and registered more than 1,000 pawn customers one after another, jointly requesting the county government to order the pawnshop to be responsible for compensation.</p>
<p>August Political Expenses Finally Settled: The county government and its affiliated bureaus' political expenses have been barely maintained with construction funds borrowed earlier. After August 12th, all applications had no landing place. After a public resolution at the local temporary conference to borrow 40,000 dollars for grain transport to provide relief, it was difficult to find borrowers due to local economic exhaustion, despite the resolution. County magistrate Pan Zhongjia, with no other option, went to Shanghai the other day to host a banquet for gentlemen and merchants residing in Shanghai, urging them to borrow money with all his might. More than 9,000 dollars of silver were borrowed and are being rushed to Jiading to meet urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The 36th Brigade Comes to Wuxi to Suppress Lake Bandits: Dai Yue, Brigade Commander of the 36th Independent Brigade of the Army, sent Lieutenant Li Zhou of the Brigade Department to Wuxi the other day to discuss methods of suppressing the lake bandits with the county government and the Second Water Police District. The water police district explained in detail the surrounding situation of Taihu Lake, the places where the lake bandits appear and hide, the separation and gathering of the bandits, and the points that should be paid attention to at present and in the future, so that the army can have a grasp when it departs for suppression. Lieutenant Li has gone to Chang and Wujin County Governments, as well as the 10th Detachment of the 2nd Water Police District to cooperate with everything. At the same time, Shen Wei, the director of the Second District, also wrote a letter of opinion on suppressing the lake bandits and discussed it with Brigade Commander Dai.</p>
<p>The Issue of Police Jurisdiction on the Railway Station Road: The police administration on the section from the railway station to the railway hotel in this county was previously maintained by the 4th section of the Railway Police stationed in Wuxi. The county Public Security Bureau has never interfered. Recently, Hua Pu, the director of the county Public Security Bureau, believes that the section also belongs to the territory of Wuxi County. Moreover, the area has been included in the model police experimental area. It seems necessary to take back the police administration in that section. After submitting it to the county political conference for discussion, it was publicly decided that the bureau should first send a letter to the section chief Guan of the 4th police section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, requesting permission to transfer the station to the 6th branch of the bureau to send police to guard it. In the future, the bureau will send police to maintain the traffic of passengers when the train arrives. After the letter was sent, Director Guan of the brigade replied, stating that the police power could not be abandoned and was unwilling to transfer it. The wording was very strong. After the Public Security Bureau approved the letter, it sent another letter yesterday to argue vigorously, vaguely stating that the so-called railway police is also a kind of administrative police and that the matter is one. However, since the place belongs to Wuxi County, the lives, property, and traffic order of the people in that place are the responsibility of the bureau and must be protected. It is unknown how Director Guan will reply after receiving the letter.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Provincial Security Regiment Goes to the Eastern Countryside to Suppress Bandits: Banditry in the eastern countryside of Tongyi has revived. On the 19th, the county government consulted with Zhu Mian, the commander of the Provincial Security Regiment stationed in Tong, and sent a team to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Refuses to Undertake Military Reception: The County Chamber of Commerce received a notice from the county government to be responsible for planning military reception. A joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees was immediately convened. It was generally agreed that whether the military reception of each county should be the responsibility of the Chamber of Commerce is not clearly stipulated in the Chamber of Commerce Law promulgated by the Ministry. Moreover, the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce forwarded an telegram from the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, informing the Chambers of Commerce in various places to check that the Chambers of Commerce do not need to prepare for various garrison supplies and that the local officials are responsible. The county government was informed by letter that the Chamber of Commerce is not responsible for planning, raising funds, and sending personnel for military reception.</p>
<p>Cities and Villages Each Have Received Thorough Rain: Nantong has been suffering from drought for a long time. Fortunately, heavy rain fell from 2 a.m. on the 19th until night, and people's hearts were at ease.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Major Fire in Daqiao Town: The Guangxing Grocery Store in Daqiao Town, District 2 of the county, is the largest store in the town and also sells kerosene. On the night before last (the 17th), at about 12 o'clock, the kerosene room of the store suddenly caught fire. The partner ran out of the door and beat the gong to call for help. The neighbors arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire, but the wind was very strong and it could not be extinguished for a while. It took five hours to stop. It is estimated that more than ten families were burned down, with losses of about 20,000 dollars.</p>

<p>Free Talk Second Branch Talk People are given yellow jackets  Looking at the yellow jacket of Zhanlu, it was something left to princes and ministers during the Qing Dynasty. At that time, it was considered a great honor, but now it looks very strange. It is said that the Mongolian princes have not yet woken up from this yellow jacket dream. The central government catered to their preferences and bestowed 37 yellow jackets on them. Swords were given to martyrs, rouge was given to beauties, and yellow jackets were given to Mongolians. Unexpectedly, after the imperial bestowal of yellow jackets, there were also yellow jackets bestowed by the people. Some people say that the yellow jacket has a strong odor of the imperial system. I say that's not right. Whether it's the imperial system or not, it's in the spirit, not in the material. The yellow jacket, which was once considered very noble, is now mostly seen as very lowly, except by the Mongolians. Giving them yellow jackets is not that great. For example, in the past, scholars risked their lives to win a copper top of at least one rank. What about now? Even if he is given a first-rank red top, he would be ashamed to wear it. For example, the high hat of the Yuan Dynasty was worn on the heads of prime ministers. How noble was that? Zhu Taizu overthrew the Hu Yuan and gave the prime minister's hat to the servants, which became the red and black hat that has been handed down to this day. Everyone sees it as very lowly! The yellow jacket, which has already expired, is also like this. Let the Mongolian princes show off. We just pretend that this never happened. If the Mongolian princes are willing to wear yellow jackets, it means they have been won over by the Republic of China, which can keep them from rebelling. As I heard, the tide of those wearing black jackets is rising in the world, and the white Russians wearing white jackets are helping the evildoers. The descendants of the communists wearing red jackets are still active in the mainland, and recently I heard that some people want to organize a group wearing blue jackets. Alas! The five-color flag of red, yellow, blue, white, and black is already torn to pieces, but the five-color jackets of red, yellow, blue, white, and black are reflecting each other. This is something worth our surprise! Talk about Chinese names Yu Yungen The names of Chinese people are really [numerous]. In addition to the formal name and style name, there is the childhood milk name, the school name for entering school, the genealogy name, the posthumous epithet, and also the alias, the nickname. Also, the place of origin and the official title are also used as names. 丨丨Such as Li Huangpi, Duan Hefei, Liu Liuzhou, Du Gongbu, etc. What I am talking about here is limited to ordinary names. The rest will be discussed with you when I have time. The most common names for ordinary people are auspicious words such as [Fu] [Lu] [Shou] [Xiang] [Qing] [Xing]. The second most common are boastful words such as [Zhen Qian] [Bing Kun] [Zhen Yu] [Guo Liang] [Ren Jie]. The next most common are humble words such as [Zi Tong] [Shou Yu] [Jing De] [Yong Xiu]. Women's names, as a result of the emphasis on chastity and virtue throughout the ages and the praise of women with flowers, plants, and treasures by literati, mostly cannot escape [Zhen] [Fen] [Cui] [Yu] [Qin] [Bao] [E: : :. Recently, there are many modern women who like to use foreign names such as [Mary] [Lily] [Lena]. This thing should be the happiest for several female students. It is also common to use the names of outstanding animals that were considered auspicious in ancient times as names. Such as [Qi] [Ji] [Liu] [Hua] [Lin] [Feng] [Long] [Hu], etc. It can be said that it is not uncommon. [Turtle] was originally considered to be the longest-lived animal in ancient times and was called one of the [Four Spirits]. However, later the world used it as a derogatory term. Therefore, apart from Li Guinian and Lu Guimeng in the Tang and Song Dynasties, it is rare to see it. However, many Japanese neighbors still like to use the word [Turtle] as their name. The names of the small third son, small Xizi, Jiqingzi of the Jiangbei compatriots and the names of the A cat, A dog, A Da, A Er, A Mei (the male is called [Xiong A Mei]) of the Pudong fellow villagers can be said to be the most vulgar. However, in fact, their fellow villagers do not like such names. It is really because there are too few names in their minds that can be used. Therefore, they just [small third son] [small Xizi] [A cat] [A dog] randomly called. It is not uncommon to use ready-made idioms or serial words as names recently. Like Dai Tianchou, Zhang Siwei, Yan Zhong, Yin Qin, etc. There are too many to list. As for strange or funny names, there have already been some in ancient times. Such as Cheng Bux识 and Jun Buyi in the Han Dynasty. In recent years, it has become even more popular. If you don't believe it, you can check the program list of various recreation venues. You will definitely find many names such as [Hi hi] [Haha] [Smile] and the like. Many new literary writers often like to use newly created pseudonyms to sign their names when publishing their works so that readers cannot easily see their true faces. Such as Lu Xun, Mao Dun, and Ba Jin, none of them are real names. Some careless readers even regard them as real names. A Record of the People's Recreational Meeting Er Qiang Songjiang People's Education Center. The People's Recreational Meeting was held in the center and sports field from the 12th to the 16th of the month. Every night from 7:00 to 10:00, it was very prosperous for a while. On the fourth night of the opening, Yu and two or three friends went together. When they arrived at the gate, they saw a colorful archway towering high, solemn and colorful. Inside the gate, green round lanterns were hung all over the aisle. [May you be healthy. I wish you good health] and other slogans. Along the aisle to the front of the center, there is a huge amount called Health Hall. Next to it is a couplet. [You are in the People's Education Center]. Farmers, workers, merchants, and soldiers all increase their common sense. [Stepping into the Health Hall. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Everyone must be hygienic. It is surrounded by lace. The workmanship is quite exquisite. The auditorium in the hall is arranged in a garden style. Bamboo and trees in the hall are shaded. There is a bridge in the middle. It is transformed from the Guan Bridge of Wengong Temple. It can be said that it is wishful thinking. There is a couplet at the foot of the bridge. [No matter how powerful you are, if you don't pay attention to hygiene, you can't walk this road today. [You must know that you have no prescription. Everything requires cleanliness. Passing this bridge with a clear mind and few desires.] There is a plaque on it called the Bridge of Longevity. There is a pavilion on the top of the bridge. The pavilion has a door. The couplet on the door is [Climb to the land of longevity together and enter Kangzhuang together]. Willow branches hang low beside the bridge. Vines and kudzu are wrapped around the bridge. Interspersed with five-color small electric lights. The wireless radio station is located on the floor of the hall. The clear song comes from between the flowers and trees. It is even more interesting. There are five vigilance rooms on the right of the hall. Each room has four small holes. People can peep from the holes. The four rooms are arranged with four items of hygiene: food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The last room is the result of unhygienic conditions. A skeleton and a corpse are displayed inside. The light is faint green. It is frightening to look at. The west of the Health Hall is the Paradise. The garden is located in the sports field. The two square lights in front of the door are several feet larger. The words Paradise are embedded on it. The field is divided into several places such as national skills, basketball, recreation, ring toss, and Wenhua. Green lights are densely distributed. Electric lights are bright. There are even more viewers. This meeting is well organized. The scale is grand. However, the talent and funding are unexpected. There are only seven employees in the center. Although there is assistance from the county party department, it is only more than ten people. The cost is no more than dozens of yuan. It is very difficult. Their heart is bitter. Egg in egg Shen Zhenyue Heifeng Farm outside Pinghu East City. There are a group of hens. There are about dozens of feathers. There is a chicken among them. The body is fat and healthy. Every day, she must steal insects from the toilet. Since the beginning of the month. Lay an egg every day. It is as big as a goose egg. The shell is thin and lustrous. Breaking its shell. In addition to egg white. There is also an egg. The size and shape are the same as ordinary chicken eggs. This kind of miracle of egg in egg. So far, more than ten pieces have been produced. The workers on the farm. Compete with each other to eat. I thought it could nourish the body. It's really rare. I will record it for research. Green Plantain Xu Wanhua Shanghai is ten feet away from the hustle and bustle. It is not easy to see the color of plantain. I remember reading books in the village. Three or two plantains were planted outside the thatched house. The green shade is full of curtains. Separated from the summer atmosphere. I almost don't know what world the sweltering heat is. Now the scorching sun is baking the window and the heat is rampant. Chasing the old dream. It is impossible to reach. So pick up the past. Become a short history of plantain. Plantain bed The large plantain leaves are four or five feet long. Pick it and take it down. Pave the eight beds. Recommend it with a bamboo pillow. Occasionally tired from reading in the afternoon. That is, rest on it. The sweat is not prestige. Satisfied. Its coolness is much better than before. Plantain dew The clear dew is stored in the plantain leaves. Changying is pure white. Almost full all night. Every morning, before the sun comes out, use a jade plate to store it. Store it in a ceramic jar. Keep it for cooking tea from time to time. The three elements of color, aroma, and taste are complete. And use a little of this dew. Wash the eyes every day. Over time, it can make the vision clear and unusual. Plantain leaves and fragrant calligraphy Calligraphy and painting are written on plantain leaves instead of paper. Write it and repaint it. Paint it and write it again. Cool air is generated at the wrist. Ink flowers are green. Intoxicated. Character. Happy. If the person thinks it is more neat. Then don't repaint it. Keep it on the desk. To be viewed at leisure. When the autumn wind rises. He then returns to destruction with nature. Yu is also regarded as flowing water and floating clouds. No longer lingering. This is probably just to fight the enemy's mood. And not enough to tell people. Making fans with plantain leaves Plantain leaf fans have become a kind of civilian favor. However, those who use them to go in and out are only used by women. And it is advisable to have a petite shape and a white texture. Women should carefully paint their names in ink. Glue the wet paper on the four sides. Bake it with a lamp. Then wipe it once. The name is deeply rooted in the fan surface. To recognize it. The fan I use. It was a special gift from a friend. The circle is one and a half feet in diameter. Huge and unparalleled. When shaking, the wind is very strong. My friend once said. You can't live in this plantain house without this plantain fan. However, the need on that day. Not as urgent as today. But today I think about it. And it's not available. Plantain window Plantain should be planted outside the wearing. It is suitable for rain and sunshine. Whenever it is full of wind and rain. Old friends came from afar. The joy of making tea and talking about ancient and modern times. At that time, the sound of splashing water helped me to have a quiet interest. Fangshi The joy of the ancients [When talking about the night rain in Bashan]. Even if the long day is like a year. Watching books and learning to be quiet. [I don't know noon when the red sun is in the sky]. It is also a good place. Plantain fruit Cut off half of the plantain trunk in winter. Wrap it in rice straw. Keep the roots warm.

<p>Local News: Chen Yixing, who was willing to take the blame for others, feared that Yun Huifang would be incriminated, claiming that he was responsible for the bombing of Yongchang. After investigation by the police, it was found that he was not involved, and Yun Huifang was released yesterday. Since retiring from the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, Yun felt that local unscrupulous merchants had forgotten the tragic bombing of Shanghai by the Japanese invaders and were sabotaging the boycott movement by openly smuggling Japanese goods. Therefore, he and his comrades organized the "Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group" to specifically deal with such unscrupulous merchants. Later, due to careless actions, he was arrested by the Chinese police and transferred to the First Special District Local Court. He was released on bail and is scheduled for a continued trial next Monday. Since the case occurred, people from all walks of life have expressed sympathy and admiration for Yun's patriotic actions. Recently, it aroused Chen Yirong's envy. He claimed to have thrown the bomb at Yongchang Coal Company on Xinzha Road, which was privately importing Japanese coal, and was willing to bear the criminal responsibility for Yun Huifang, which is indeed a rare and strange story. It is reported that Chen is from Zhejiang, only a little over twenty years old, and currently works at Deshengchang Department Store at 79 Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession. Since Yun's case was discovered and the public praised it, Chen felt inferior and eager to express himself, hoping to gain social recognition. However, he felt he did not have the courage of Yun to go to justice. Later, he had a strange idea, thinking that the bomber of Yongchang Coal Company had not yet been caught, so he could substitute himself for Yun. Therefore, on the afternoon of the seventeenth, he secretly left the store he was working at and went to the entrance of the New World on Xizang Road. He suddenly surrendered to the Chinese constable standing guard at number 2844, claiming that he threw the bomb at Yongchang. The constable immediately took him to the Xinzha Police Station. After questioning, the police chief said that the bomber in the case had already been identified by Yun Huifang as Cai Yaozu. Not only was the name of the person who surrendered inconsistent, but the rest of his confession was also full of contradictions. However, in order to handle the case carefully, Chen was still taken to the entrance of Yongchang to inquire about the bombing process at the time. Chen was even more dumbfounded and did not know how to answer. The next day, he was taken to the First Special Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi questioned him. According to his confession, he was afraid that Yun Huifang would be incriminated. He admired Yun's character very much, so he was willing to substitute himself to exonerate Yun from the crime. At that time, the police lawyer stated that the Yun case was serious and it was necessary to conduct a detailed investigation to determine whether Chen Yirong was involved. He requested Judge Wu to temporarily detain Chen for investigation and not to disclose the information to the public for the time being. Until yesterday morning, Chen was taken to the court again, and Judge Wu interrogated him again. According to police lawyer Wang Yaotang, after investigation, the defendant had nothing to do with the Yongchang bombing case, and his surrender and false claim were his own idea. Therefore, the police did not advocate prosecution. Now that the case of Chai Tongde, the owner of Deshengchang, has been submitted, it can prove everything about Chen. Chai testified that Chen had been working in the store all day since he was hired and rarely went out. On July 28, the day Yongchang was bombed, Chen did not leave the store at all. When questioned about Chen's confession, it was similar to what was said before. Judge Wu then instructed Chen Yirong to be taken back by the manager of Deshengchang for strict supervision and not to cause trouble, and released him immediately.</p>
<p>A Corpse in a Suitcase on the Jiang'an Steamer: The deceased was dressed in a Boy Scout uniform. The passenger carrying the suitcase disembarked midway. A reporter from this newspaper met with Mr. So-and-so, an employee of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, at a banquet yesterday. According to him, the company's Jiang'an steamer, which sails along the Yangtze River, set sail from Shanghai on the twelfth of this month. At that time, there was a passenger who was about forty years old, well-dressed, and carried a large, new-style, sturdy leather suitcase, claiming to be going to Nanjing. However, when the steamer arrived at Tongzhou, this unwelcome guest suddenly disembarked and never returned. At the time, no one paid attention to it. It was not until the steamer approached Jiangyin that a strange odor suddenly emanated from the cabin, making people want to vomit. After a thorough search by the crew, it was discovered that the smell came from this new-style leather suitcase. The comprador then learned about it and had people open the suitcase to inspect it. Unexpectedly, when the suitcase was opened, there was a decomposing male corpse with two knife wounds on the head, dressed in a Boy Scout uniform, yellow shorts, a gray Zhongshan suit, and barefoot with no shoes, about thirty years old, with a shaved head. The corpse was completely filled with cotton wool all around. The comprador reported it to the Jiangyin Police Station and voluntarily paid 50 yuan for burial expenses. It is said that photos have been taken and the body is temporarily placed there pending identification by family members and investigation of the murderer.</p>
<p>Postal Administration Discovers Counterfeit Stamps: Verified by the Beijing Printing Bureau, the Postal Authorities Dispatch Personnel for Close Investigation. The Shanghai Postal Administration recently discovered a type of counterfeit triangular-denomination stamp. After reporting to the General Administration, it was sent to the Beijing Printing Bureau for expert verification, which proved it was indeed counterfeit. It is learned that the Administration, in addition to instructing its subordinates to pay attention, has also sent personnel to secretly investigate.</p>
<p>The following situation was discovered: A week ago, the registered mail office of the Shanghai Postal Administration received a registered mail item of considerable weight with triangular-denomination stamps affixed. The postal worker at the registered mail office noticed that the color of the stamps was blurrier than usual, but was unable to confirm their authenticity at the time, so they were still accepted. However, after the sender left, the clerk, Fu Guan, felt that it was different from real stamps, so he took off the stamps and reported it to the Director of the Administration, Zha Peilin, for review and verification. At that time, the Director of the Administration, Zha Peilin, was also unable to determine, so he forwarded it to the General Administration along with the stamps, requesting review and verification to serve as the basis for investigation. The Director-General, Huang Naishu, took the matter seriously after receiving the report and sent it to the Beijing Printing Bureau for expert verification. The results confirmed that it was indeed counterfeit and a detailed list of the differences between the counterfeit stamps and the real stamps was compiled, requesting the Postal Administration to instruct its subordinates to pay attention.</p>
<p>The differences: The counterfeit stamps were identified by experts at the Beijing Printing Bureau, who pointed out the following differences: (1) The pattern is blurry and unclear, the lines are thicker, especially the lines of the altar. (2) The semi-circular line of the character is connected to the tree on the right, and there is no shadow of the tree under the tree. (3) The upper shoulder of the [three-zero] character in the foreign text is too far from the zero character. (4) The lower HIWA letters of the foreign text are not connected.</p>
<p>Official’s Conversation: Yesterday afternoon, the correspondent from Datong News Agency visited a senior official of the Bureau. According to the official, the Bureau discovered counterfeit stamps around 1921 and after a strict investigation, the counterfeiting organization was destroyed, confiscating many counterfeit stamps and a printing template. The official believed that the counterfeit stamps recently discovered were remnants from the previous case and that their number should not be large. However, in order to prevent any possibility, the General Administration had already instructed the Shanghai Administration to send personnel for close investigation to determine whether there was another counterfeiting organization, in order to take legal action.</p>
<p>Administration’s Order: Yesterday, the Shanghai Postal Administration issued Order No. 1638, instructing all postal employees to pay attention. The order stated that recently, two triangular stamps, similar to counterfeit stamps, were found on registered mail. After verification by the Beijing Printing Bureau, it was confirmed that they were counterfeit. In order to conduct a close investigation and prevent the recurrence of similar situations, each district bureau should instruct its staff to carefully inspect the stamps to prevent misuse. Postal Director, Zha Peilin, August 19, 1932.</p>
<p>New Village to Be Constructed in Gaoqiao: The Shanghai Municipal Government’s Bureau of Public Utilities, in view of the lack of scenic lakes and mountains in Shanghai, and the scorching heat during the summer, with no place to escape the heat, established a seawater bathing beach in Gaoqiao on the coast of Pudong for Western men and women to swim. A few days ago, reporters were invited to visit, and it was seen that the layout was appropriate and the equipment was excellent, providing a summer resort for Shanghai residents. It can be said that the idea is beautiful and the method is good. It is now heard that Mr. Xu has initiated a model new village in Gaoqiao. The site is located near the Gaoqiao Ferry Terminal, facing north and south, and surrounded by water on three sides. It covers more than 30 acres, divided into eleven districts, the largest being three acres per district, and the smallest being one and a half acres per district. The districts are sold separately, allowing people to choose. It is very suitable for gentlemen and merchants from various provinces in Shanghai and employees of customs, postal, banking, and foreign companies to use as residences or build villas. Because there are three city ferries and one commercial ferry running between Shanghai and Gaoqiao, with forty round trips every day, the one-way time is about one hour, making transportation very convenient. There are also more than 30 acres of land on the south side of the road, with a large river on the southwest side and roads on the northeast side. Those who want to establish a new market can have designs and construction of electricity and telephones arranged. It is said that the contact address is 185 Jiangyin Street, outside the South Gate of Nanshi. Mr. Yang Pu said that in the future, after the new village is realized, the scenery will be clear and cool, with a separate world, making people think of a paradise.</p>
<p>Citizens' Union Opposes Telephone Price Increase: Representatives to Meet at the City Chamber of Commerce Today at 2 PM. The Citizens' Union, in view of the inadequate justification for the telephone price increase and the resulting backlash from users across the city, previously organized a special committee to oppose the telephone price increase. After reviewing the registration forms from various households, it was decided to organize a United Association of Users Opposing Telephone Price Increases to insist on opposition to the end and adopt effective measures to resist it. A representative assembly of users opposing the telephone price increase will be held at the City Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge at 1 PM today to discuss the details of the implementation. The relevant information is recorded below.</p>
<p>Notice to Users Regarding Attendance: Dear Sir/Madam, the telephone price increase is an extraordinary matter and is clearly inappropriate due to the company's unilateral action, resulting in unanimous opposition from all users to seek legitimate ways to cancel the price increase.

<p>The Case of the Indian Constable's Tragic Murder of a Tenant: After the City Party Department approved the request of the LIZHONG Lane Zhou A'yu Tragic Case Support Association, the association submitted a request to the City Party Department for serious handling of the case of the Indian watchman's tragic murder of Zhou A'yu. The reply from the Municipal Government, which has already been reported in the previous newspaper, has now been received by the City Party Department with Instruction No. 68, informing that this association has submitted a request for investigation into the case of Chen Changkun, the landlord of LIZHONG Lane, employing an Indian to tragically murder his tenant, Zhou A'yu. The Secretariat-General, Yu, has already requested that the Municipal Government conduct an investigation. The Municipal Government has replied that the Municipal Public Security Bureau has reported that Qu Sunyi, the Assistant Section Chief of the Third Section of the Bureau, along with Wang Yan, the patrol officer in charge of the case, and witnesses, have gone to the British Consulate to formally lodge a complaint, demanding that the murderer be punished, compensation be paid, and guarantees be provided that such incidents will not happen again in the future. According to the notice, it is now notified to the association for information. With this order.</p>
<p>Song Zigao Sentenced to Eight Years for Premeditated Murder: Song Zigao from Songjiang, also known as Song Zhiguang and Li Xingting, 43 years old this year, colluded with Shen Aqin in late 1919 to kill the entire family of three, a Zhang family widow, near Xiuye Bridge outside the West Gate of his hometown, Songjiang, and stole their property before fleeing. Shen was later arrested by the authorities and executed, while Song fled to Anhui. In 1930, he sneaked into Shanghai, living on Jumen Road in Nanshi. Recommended by a friend, he was employed as an inspector at the Guanshengyuan General Factory. When Sun Baohua, a fellow villager living at No. 84 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, found out, he often extorted and threatened Sun. Fearing that he would leak the information, Song harbored deep hatred and planned to kill Sun. On March 3rd, 16th, and April 19th of this year, he tricked Sun into writing three "suicide notes" and stole all of Sun's seals. On the evening of April 24th at 10 p.m., he lured Sun to the Great World under the pretext of playing, leading him to the highest point of the roof. Song suddenly took out a razor hidden in his pocket and slashed Sun's throat. He stuffed the fake suicide note into Sun's pocket and fled. The Great World reported it to the police, who sent Sun to Renji Hospital. Fortunately, the injury was minor, and he recovered and was discharged from the hospital. The French police inspector Mao Jingen and the detective Bao Shushan discovered that Song was hiding in Room 24 of the Jiangban Hotel in Huajin Lane, Public Concession. Together with the Chinese and foreign detectives from the British police, they rushed to arrest Song on the morning of the 27th of the same month. Song was still lying in bed. Seeing the Chinese and foreign detectives enter the room, he knew things were bad and jumped out of bed, trying to resist arrest and escape. However, he was captured by the detectives, and his chest was injured. Song was taken back to the French police station and sent to the Second District Court. The police charged him with premeditated attempted murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law and obstructing official duties under Article 142. Judge Xiong Huihua opened the court to hear the case. Due to the emergence of doubts, a re-argument was opened, evidence was reviewed, and a lawyer was appointed to defend the defendant. Since the defendant was arrested, it has been 100 days. The debate was finally concluded a few days ago, and the verdict was delivered yesterday. Song Zigao was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for premeditated attempted murder and two months of imprisonment for using violence and intimidation against public officials in the lawful performance of their duties, to be served concurrently with the eight-year sentence. The number of days of pre-trial detention was deducted at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The razor was confiscated, and the defendant was transferred to the detention center. After the case occurred, the Songjiang County Government prepared a document to send police to Shanghai to transfer him. At that time, because the case was not over, it was instructed to wait until the case was concluded before notifying them to come to Shanghai to receive him. Now that the Shanghai case has been judged, the Second Special Court will notify the Songjiang County Government to send personnel to Shanghai to bring the defendant back to stand trial.</p>
<p>Zhong Renjie and Others Petition the Municipal Government to Remedy the Issue of Municipal Councilors: Concerns That Special Districts Are Overrepresented May Obscure Public Opinion, Requesting Methods for Remedy to Uphold the Spirit of Autonomy. Since the Shanghai Municipal Provisional Council was established by the Municipal Government, things have been mostly settled. The list of candidates has also been approved. Recently, municipal committee members from Pudong, Wusong, Jiangwan, Pengpu, and citizens such as Zhong Renjie, Yang Xinzheng, Qu Yue Tang Chengzhong, Yan Enzuo, Chen Ya'fu, Ling Zhibin, and more than 50 others have been approved by the Municipal Government as municipal councilors. However, they are mostly from the Shanghai Special District, with little connection to the situations in various rural areas, which seems inappropriate. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to Mayor Wu yesterday, offering remedies, stating:</p>
<p>"Regarding the report that municipal councilors are predominantly from the Special District, this is a humble report on the general situation of each district, requesting overall consideration and seeking urgent remedies. The spirit of autonomy lies in the participation of local people in local affairs, which is sufficient to eliminate the evils of nominal autonomy and the reality of official governance. Since the establishment of our National Government, it has been diligent in preparing for political tutelage, aiming for the implementation of constitutional government. It has enacted municipal organization laws, clearly ordering all cities to prepare for autonomy, striving for improvement, and the whole country admires it. Our Shanghai is a city of international commerce with interconnected interests, and its special circumstances cannot be ignored. Former Mayor Zhang, adhering to the central government's intentions, organized district autonomous associations, selected personnel, and actively prepared, investigating household registration and dividing regions, spending much effort, and the work was largely completed. Suddenly, it was disrupted by the Japanese寇 invasion, and the entire city of Shanghai was shocked, with most of it reduced to ruins. The pain was profound and the thought was painful. After the ceasefire and troop withdrawal, our mayor re-proposed autonomy. Although no official documents have been received, it has indeed been widely publicized in newspapers. Representatives were sent to pay respects to Secretary-General Yu, briefly explaining their views, and it was agreed to forward them. Recently, reading the Shanghai newspapers of the 23rd of last month, the approved list of Shanghai Municipal Provisional Councilors is full of talent, and there is deep hope for the future of the city. However, there is a sense of imperfection. This time, the councilors are mainly from the Special District (i.e., the current concessions), neglecting other districts, emphasizing talent and forgetting facts. Renjie and others are from this area and have closer ties. Without being presumptuous, we respectfully present the following:</p>
<p>(1) Councilors must be well-informed about the conditions in all districts of the city. The Provisional Council is a representative body during the period of appointed mayors. If it is not aware of the true conditions in all districts of the city, how can it express fair opinions and seek reforms? Looking at the list of councilors, although there are one or two Shanghai natives and a few who know the conditions in all districts of the city, most are business magnates, key members of the Party Department, education experts, and financial leaders. These are all so-called gentlemen who can be greatly entrusted but are not suited to discussing small matters. Shanghai itself has the conditions of the south, the conditions of Zhabei, and the conditions of the concessions. To treat them with the same law as the foreigners in the concessions is simply impossible. Without a detailed understanding of the conditions in all districts of the city, it is simply impossible to identify the advantages and disadvantages of each district upon taking office. This is like climbing a tree to catch a fish and is unattainable.</p>
<p>(2) Councilors must have a historical relationship with each district. The Provisional Council has the nature of representing citizens, so its members must have a generational historical relationship with the local districts, so that public opinion can be conveyed and government intentions can be announced. This time, only a few councilors are from the common people of this city, and their historical relationship with each district is too shallow to expect them to pay close attention. As a result, various municipal bureaus submit a case and pass it hastily, without considering whether it will be practical when implemented, whether it will be consistent with public opinion, or whether the people can afford it.</p>
<p>(3) Councilors must be able to represent the region. The Provisional Council is a representative body for the entire city, and its selection of personnel should conform to the meaning of representing the community. What the citizens look up to and trust are those who are well-respected in their district or nearby districts, so that they can have the effect of the body moving the arm and the arm moving the finger when things happen. If they have never met or discussed with each other, they cannot express their hidden feelings. Conversely, for councilors, they are representing people they have no relationship with, which is meaningless. Capable people may decline out of modesty, not because they are incompetent, but because they feel it is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, we deeply feel that the selection of councilors this time does not conform to the true meaning of autonomy. If it is said that before autonomy is completed, a mere agency is temporarily established for occasional consultation or to share responsibility for the authorities, that is acceptable. But if we sincerely seek the success of autonomy and promote the true spirit of autonomy, then the way to remedy it cannot be delayed. How to remedy it? The way is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Add more councilors so that appropriate people from the areas of South Shanghai, Zhabei, Wusong Yinxiang, West Shanghai, and Pudong can participate, so that when discussing cases involving the above areas or the entire city, they can engage in in-depth discussions based on the true situation of the entire city.</p>
<p>(B) If it is said that the number of councilors is fixed and cannot be increased quickly, then the number of people who should be participating from the above areas should be changed to honorary councilors in the current quota, with the area as the standard. Since there are already people from the financial sector, those in the same field can free up quota. The Party Department is the highest authority in the entire city and can of course provide guidance from its party's standpoint, so there is no need to appoint them as councilors with certain powers.</p>
<p>(C) As a last resort, if it is felt that the list has been published and cannot be revoked, and the method in (B) can only be implemented gradually, then another municipal district representative body should be formed to assist this deformed provisional council. This is the minimum remedy. If even this cannot be done, then this temporary municipal council will be seen by the citizens as a temporary council for the Shanghai Special District, unrelated to the areas of South Shanghai, Zhabei, Wusong, Yinxiang, West Shanghai, and Pudong under the real governance of the mayor (because there are few people with residences and livelihoods in the above areas). Official governance is the reality; why bother with the name of autonomy? Benevolent despotism is perhaps not incapable of promoting progress from above.</p>
<p>In short, the way of governance places primary importance on aligning names with reality. Politics in the late Qing Dynasty often used false names to deceive people, leading to disunity and the destruction of law and order. Past events are clear and should be cited as examples. When our mayor came to govern this area, it was at a time of foreign invasion, with people suffering and the city reduced to ruins. He diligently sought governance, still fearing inadequacy. If he follows the old path, how can he survive? We are foolish and deeply concerned, and dare to offer our humble contributions at the beginning, hoping that they will be adopted. The citizens would be fortunate. Whether we are praised or blamed, we leave it to your judgment."</p>
<p>Apprentice Commits Suicide by Poisoning: The father's letter angered him, and he did not want to live. Wang Longgan, a 19-year-old apprentice from Nanjing at Yuchang Towel Shop, No. 72 Xingsheng Street, French Concession, committed suicide because he received a letter from his father yesterday rebuking him for not following store rules. Wang was originally a dutiful apprentice who abided by store rules. Now that he was unjustly accused, he felt unwilling. After reading the letter, he was extremely depressed and secretly drafted a will to his close friend, generally saying that he was suffering from a severe throat ailment and planned to go to the countryside for treatment. After dinner, he swallowed weight-generating poison, covered himself with a quilt, and fell asleep. Soon, the poison took effect, and he vomited incessantly, groaning non-stop. When people noticed it, they immediately sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died half an hour later. The hospital reported it to the Dadazimingzhong Police Station, which ordered Inspector Wang Licheng to go and transport the body to Tongren Fuyuantang, pending an examination by the court.</p>
<p>Hardoon Estate Dispute Appeals: Appellant Must Deposit a Security Deposit of 12,000 Yuan Within Two Weeks. According to the Shanghai Times, after the British Court ordered the cancellation of the Hardoon estate case, Istella Hardoon refused to accept the original judgment and appealed. Yesterday morning, the lawyer representing Hardoon's wife, the appellee, applied to the British Court to order the appellant to deposit 12,000 yuan with the court within two weeks as a security deposit for litigation costs. If the deposit is not paid within the deadline, the case should be automatically cancelled. After the lawyers from both sides presented their opinions, the judge granted the request, ordering the appellant to deposit a security deposit of 11,000 yuan within two weeks.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of the Seventh District Seized a Large Batch of Red Pills: Li, the Director of the Public Security Bureau of the Seventh District of Wusong, received a tip yesterday at 1:30 a.m. that someone was selling red pills and privately selling opium lamps at No. 60 Pinghou Lane and No. 53 Beishi River Road. He immediately ordered District Officer Cao Zishi to lead chief police officer Shi Wenbin, Dong Jingyun, Shang Shouye, Pan Yucai, etc. to the addresses. At Pinghou Lane, they seized six large bags of red pills, each bag containing 500 pills, and an additional 100 scattered pills, three opium pipes, and two opium lamps, and arrested Dang Jinhui, a Xuzhou native who was selling red pills. Later, they went to No. 53 Beishi River Road, seized 200 red pills, and arrested Wang Shikai, who was selling red pills. They were all taken to the district for interrogation. Dang Jinhui, 46 years old, confessed to selling red pills, but claimed that the opium pipes and other items were left with him by friends. Wang Shikai, 47 years old, from Anhui, had nothing else to say and asked for leniency. After verifying the confession, the district director ordered that Dang Jinhui and Wang Shikai, along with the evidence, be sent to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<p>Suspects in Kidnapping Case Arrested: Two Mistresses Are Both Graduates of Normal School. Lu Liankui, Chief Detective of the General Investigation Department of the General Police Station, learned that Zhao Xingsheng from Wuxi was suspected of kidnapping, so he ordered Chinese detectives Liu Shaokui and Bao Laisheng to arrest Zhao at the intersection of Xiamen Road and Xizang Road a few days ago. They also went to Zhao's home at No. 267 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, and arrested his mistresses Xue Suying (30 years old, from Wuxi) and Wang Jinshi (i.e., Jin Suzhen, 22 years old, from Wuxi), and brought them back to the police station. Under investigation, it was learned that Zhao and others were related to the gang leader Tu Fan (i.e., Zheng Liantang) arrested by the French police. Xue and Jin were both graduates of Wuxi Normal School. Xue's husband, So-and-so, and Jin's husband, Wang Borong, had died. The two women could not maintain their livelihoods, so Xue cohabited with Zhao, and Jin also lived with them, seeking a living elsewhere. They were immediately ordered to be detained separately and sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Ru Baoji, stated that the police were still investigating the case and had not yet clarified whether Zhao and others had committed a crime, so the police would not prosecute for the time being, but only requested temporary detention for a week. Judge Shen Bingrong, after verifying the report and questioning Zhao, the third person, about his age and origin, approved the police's request and ordered temporary detention for one week.</p>
<p>Zhou Yinhua's Case of Being Raped and Sold into Prostitution: Various Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment. Zhou Yinhua, registered in Ningbo, is 14 years old this year. When she was five years old, her mother died, so her father, Zhou A'lai, entrusted her to her aunt, Chen, at No. 27 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. Last year, Chen died, and her daughter, Chen Fuying, continued to raise her. On August 5th of this year, Chen Fuying colluded with Zhang Yongxing, a watch shop owner at No. 606 Xinzha Road, and Ke Heshang, a fireman at the Xinzha District Fire Brigade No. 81, falsely claiming</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>to act as a matchmaker for Zhou Yinhua. They took Zhou to the home of Zhou Hongyuan, a fireman at No. 206, a colleague of Ke's at No. 123 Guizhou Road. That night, Hongyuan's elder brother, Zhou Huai, forcibly raped her. The next day, they sold Yinhua to the Xu Garden brothel opened by Xu Zhu, located at No. 3 Aidu Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Road, French Concession, for 300 yuan and forced her to receive guests. Because Yinhua was unwilling, she suffered torture. Two days later, Yinhua took the opportunity to escape, but was caught by the police. Zhou Yinhua's father, A'lai, also heard about the matter and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Cui Chengke to arrest Zhang Yongxing, Zhou Hongyuan, Chen Fuying, and Ke Heshang and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning. Zhou Huaide went to the court's side hall and was identified by Yinhua as the rapist, so he was also arrested, and the case was postponed. Later, under Yinhua's guidance, Chinese and foreign detectives and French police officers went to the Xu Garden brothel and arrested the madam, Xu Zhu, and brought her back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. The defendants hired lawyers such as Jiang Yiping and Fan Gang. Xu Zhu hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to defend her. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the police were prosecuting the defendants Zhang, Zhou, Chen, and Ke for the crime of disrupting family affairs under Article 257 of the Criminal Law, and Zhou Huaide for the crime of disrupting public morals under Article 240 of the Criminal Law. However, Xu Zhu was not prosecuted because she was located in the French Concession. However, her act of forcing prostitution should be reported to the Second Special Court, requesting them to send personnel to take her into custody. Judge Wu Yanqi verified the report and ruled that Xu Zhu's part should be decided first. Xu Zhu was released and should be directly transferred to the French Police Station for investigation. According to the victim, Zhou Yinhua, she was taken to Zhou Hongyuan's house on the evening of the fifth of this month and raped three times that night by Zhou's elder brother, Huaide. "I wanted to shout, but he covered my mouth with his hand, preventing me from making a sound. The next day, my father, A'lai, sent me to the brothel." Zhou Huaide denied the rape, saying that Zhou was prepared to be the wife of his cousin, Tao Changsheng. That night, she slept with his sister-in-law in the bedroom. He knew nothing about the matter of being sent to the brothel. Zhou Hongyuan claimed that his cousin had not yet married, so he acted as a matchmaker and brought Zhou Yinhua over to spend the night temporarily, with his mother watching her character and actions. That night, she slept with his wife in the room. Because there were three beds in the house, his mother, elder brother, sister-in-law, and wife were all sleeping inside, so his elder brother could not have done such a bestial thing. The next day, because his mother found that Zhou's character was not good and she had a mental illness, she was sent back. When questioned, Zhang Yongxing, Chen Fuying, and Ke Heshang all denied the act of sending Zhou to the brothel, only claiming to have acted as a matchmaker for Zhou Hongyuan's cousin, and knew nothing about the rest. After the lawyers from both sides concluded their arguments, Judge Wu sentenced Zhang Yongxing and Ke Heshang to eight months of imprisonment, Zhou Hongyuan and Chen Fuying to one year and six months of imprisonment, and Zhou Huaide to three years and six months of imprisonment. Zhou Yinhua was taken away by her father, Zhou A'lai. Zhang and Ke were allowed to leave on bail of 2,000 yuan each pending appeal.</p>
<p>Child Bride Raped Under Duress: Two Suspicious Men and Women Detained After Heavy Rain. At around 7 p.m. the previous night, members of the fourth squad of the Yangjing District Security Corps were patrolling the southern end of Yangjiadu, Pudong. It was after a heavy rain. They saw a man and a woman arguing on the road, so they went forward to inquire about the reason. According to the woman, she was named Chen Awu, 15 years old,</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The artillery regiment was sent to Cheng, stationed to defend Cheng County. The provincial security forces were sent to Nantong to suppress bandits, leaving only the Third Battalion to garrison. The Ministry of Military Affairs has now dispatched the Independent Eighth Artillery Regiment to Cheng. In addition to telegraphing the Fortress Headquarters to locate suitable quarters, on the 18th, it also sent Battalion Commander Cui Shichang to Cheng to discuss all related matters.</p>
<p>Commander Xie is dissatisfied with the "Cheng Qing Bao" (Clarifying Report), the county party headquarters-run newspaper. On the 16th, the "New Voice" column on the fourth page contained a photograph of a scene in a movie theater, with the headline "A Rowdy Military Man Fills the Entire Venue." It mentioned the fortress headquarters and included phrases such as "[Perhaps someone will come to cause trouble at the movie theater? Perhaps there are Japanese spies trying to take advantage of the situation? That's why these artillerymen from the national defense fortress have been invited, to prevent any unforeseen events.]" Commander Xie Muhai believes that these remarks contain implied criticism and are quite shocking, undermining the purpose of the military discipline rectification. He has sent a letter to the county party headquarters, requesting that "Cheng Qing Bao" be appropriately punished.</p>
<p>The Provincial Office orders an investigation into a complaint. The Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government has received a complaint from Wang Fanzhi, the head of Chunlu Town outside Beimen, accusing Shen Hualong of the 20th Water Police Brigade of being deeply addicted to opium and engaging in the illicit transport of opium. It has instructed Magistrate Ma to investigate and report back. According to Wang Fanzhi, the seal in question was stolen and used without his knowledge, and he did not file the complaint. Magistrate Ma finds it highly questionable how the town office seal could be so easily stolen. He insists on a thorough investigation before submitting a report to the Civil Affairs Department.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Provincial Department provides relief to Zhenjiang weaving households. He Yushu, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry, in order to alleviate the decline of the cotton weaving handicraft industry, proposed a plan to borrow funds to purchase yarn and lend it to weaving households in Zhenjiang. This plan has been approved by the provincial government meeting. Currently, arrangements have been made to pledge official shares of the Dasheng Yarn Factory for a loan of 20,000 yuan. Meanwhile, preparations are underway to establish the Zhenjiang Cotton Weaving Industry Guidance Committee. The committee members will include two representatives from the Department of Industry, two technical personnel, one representative from the Chamber of Commerce, two representatives from the silk and cloth industry, and two representatives from the weaving households. The Department of Industry has already appointed Secretary Hou Zhenping and Section Chief Tang Jianzhong as its representatives. Technicians Qiu Ling and Section Member Guan Zhendong have been appointed as the technical personnel. The committee will be established as soon as the representatives from other organizations are nominated. Regarding the situation of cotton weaving households in Zhenjiang, there were approximately 1,000 looms during the peak period. Currently, there are only about 300 looms. Currently, over 20 weaving households are in urgent need of relief, with about 100 looms.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Anhui riverside merchants go to Wuhu to participate in sales conference. Zhou Sannong, manager of the Anhui riverside salt affairs inspection branch and concurrent director of the Anhui riverside salt transport bureau, still needs to stay in Yangzhou to handle matters related to his previous position as director of the Yangzhou inspection branch. Therefore, the newly appointed Anhui affairs will temporarily be handled by Inspector Zeng Yangfeng from the general inspection office. It is reported that Manager Zeng is eager to discuss matters related to sales of Anhui riverside salt, so he has repeatedly telegraphed the Anhui riverside merchants in Yangzhou to go to Wuhu to discuss everything. Therefore, the colleagues on the Anhui riverside have decided to publicly elect Zhou Shiqing, Jia Songping, and Yin Kejun as representatives to go to Wuhu for discussions. The representatives have already taken a train to Wuhu last night (the 19th).</p>
<p>The lawsuit involving the Dayuan shareholders meeting has been judged.</p>
<p>The Dayuan Salt Manufacturing Company held a shareholders' meeting on May 5th of this year and elected Li Meiyin as the company's managing director. Subsequently, Shen Kunhe and others believed that the resolutions of the company's shareholders' meeting were illegal and fundamentally did not recognize Li as the managing director, thus starting a lawsuit in the Jiangdu Local Branch Court. After the court reviewed the company's articles of association, the signature book from the May 5th meeting this year, the proxy forms, the election ballots, and the resolutions, it summoned both parties for a hearing, which has now concluded. Yesterday, the court issued a judgment that the company's resolutions are confirmed to be invalid.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Urgent plea to postpone the collection of old taxes and the issuance of public bonds. Jiaxing has suffered consecutive years of crop failure, especially severe this spring. Farmers in the rural areas have no place to borrow, and many are on the verge of starvation. Local figures in this county have raised substantial funds to purchase rice and set up a grain lending association for poor farmers. After investigation by the Xiangzhen Township Office, they will be responsible for lending the grain. Unexpectedly, the province is not allocating funds for relief at this time, but instead sending special envoys to push for the urgent collection of old taxes and the issuance of public bonds, causing widespread public resentment. Local figures such as Lu Chujue and Zhu Zhenfan, yesterday, pleaded on behalf of the people by telegraphing the Provincial Government's Department of Finance, urging them to consider the severity of the situation and understand the people's hardship, allowing the postponement of the issuance and collection of various public bonds and old taxes on land, to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The loss of an anchovy cargo ship sunk by the tide. On the night of the 17th, a cargo ship loaded with dried anchovies sailed from Ningbo to the Xinwan bottom area, opposite Nansha in Xiaoshan. It carried over 1,500 catties of freshly packed, powerful dried and fresh anchovies. Due to a large autumn tide, the seven boatmen were careless, and the entire ship capsized. All the dried anchovies sank to the bottom of the river, with losses exceeding 5,000 yuan. Two of the boatmen were swept away by the tide and are still missing.</p>
<p>The loss of land due to autumn tide erosion. The sandy land along the Qiantang River in Xiaoshan has been eroding and accreting in recent years, without any stability. This year's autumn tide eroded the sandy land used for growing crops, which is about three miles away. The sand dwellers have already reclaimed and planted soybeans, melons, and fruits. Much of it has been destroyed by the tide. It is reported that from next month, if there are autumn rains, strong winds, and tidal surges, the losses will be even greater. Currently, the siltation of the Qiantang River is a serious problem and needs to be dredged urgently.</p>
<p>Banditry is rampant in Tianle Township. Tianle Township, located at the border of Xiaoshan and Shaoxing, has always been an area with many bandits. Recently, there has been a new outbreak of banditry, which is very rampant. They are well-equipped with firearms. Currently, several bandits are specifically kidnapping wealthy individuals for ransom. Shimenwan Mountain is being used as a place to hide the kidnapped. The chief of the Linpu Public Security Branch Bureau of Shaoshan and Xiaoshan, Ge Ziwen, believes that the existing police force is too weak. Magistrate Wang of Shaoxing County has telegraphed the province, requesting that a security team be sent to be stationed permanently to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>The Water Police Bureau jointly suppresses bandits. Bandit leader Zhang Zhuqing has gathered hundreds of followers, well-equipped with firearms. He is kidnapping people and demanding ransoms in Tiantian Ao, a village in Linhai Township. The Fifth Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Forces stationed in Jiao (Haimen) has repeatedly sent troops to arrest them, but without success. The Zhejiang Offshore Water Police Bureau has received a report and has sent the Qinan warship, together with the Sixth and Seventh Water Police Squads stationed in Jiao, to jointly suppress the bandits. Unexpectedly, the bandits dared to resist, resulting in fierce battles for several days and nights. Eventually, artillery fire was used, and the bandits could not withstand the attack and retreated in disorder. Dozens of bandits were killed on the spot, six were captured alive, forty-two firearms were seized, and nineteen refugees were rescued.</p>

<h3>Passed the proposal to incorporate martial arts into the National College of Physical Education or College of Physical Education</h3>
<p>(1) Proposal to establish a National Martial Arts College</p>
<p>(1) Du Longyuan advocated that there is no need to establish it, because a resolution has already been made to establish a National College of Physical Education, and martial arts should be included in it. If a martial arts college is set up separately, it may not be possible in the current Chinese economic situation.</p>
<p>(2) Wang Geng advocated maintaining the review case, saying that in order to effectively promote martial arts, it is necessary to establish a martial arts college independently to be effective.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Zhijiang proposed a revision to add the two words "physical education" to become the National Martial Arts Physical Education College.</p>
<p>(4) The chairman explained that the case of establishing a National College of Physical Education passed yesterday actually includes martial arts in physical education.</p>
<p>(5) Wu Tunan said that the National Sports Conference should study the integration of Chinese, European, American, and Japanese sports, and the physical education school should have international martial arts included in physical education.</p>
<p>(6) Wang Yaodong explained that martial arts cannot stand side by side with physical education, and a martial arts physical education college should be established.</p>
<p>(7) Zhang Zhiwang said that the amendment to the Martial Arts Physical Education College can be cancelled, but martial arts does need to establish a special school independently. Martial arts has a long history. In responding to national disasters, such as the victory of the 19th Route Army in the Shanghai War, the Dadao Team had a considerable effect, which is the manifestation of the power of martial arts. Speaking calmly, impartially, a few words, martial arts should be promoted.</p>
<p>(8) Su You explained that in order to cultivate martial arts professionals and awaken society to understand the position of martial arts in physical education, martial arts needs to establish a special school.</p>
<p>(9) Ma Liang explained the necessity of promoting martial arts. In the face of national disaster, all Chinese weapons are inferior to others. If we don't promote the martial arts passed down by our ancestors, and still worship foreigners with the old purpose, it is extremely shameful, extremely shameful.</p>
<p>(10) Bin Lai Geng said Mr. Ma Liang's proposal.</p>
<p>(11) Huang Zhenming said that the content of martial arts is very broad and worthy of special study. There is a need to establish a special school.</p>

<p>(13) The chairman then put the amendment of martial arts people's national sports college or sports college to a vote, and 51 people voted in favor.</p>
<h3>Passed the [Private Physical Education School Should be Separately Rewarded or Banned]</h3>
<p>II. Strictly screen private physical education schools and reward or ban them separately. (1) Sun Mingxiu explained the process of the merger and establishment of this case.</p>
<p>(2) Chen Jiaxi said that France's victory in the Prussian War was based on the physical education associations run by private individuals. Private physical education schools should be rewarded and promoted, not banned.</p>
<p>(3) Chen Mengyu said that the method in this case only bans and does not reward. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>(4) Du Longyuan suggested that the reason why physical education schools are not well-run is entirely due to the lack of professionalism and ability of the organizers themselves, and advocated deleting the seven words "reward or ban separately."</p>
<p>(5) Su Jingyou explained that physical education urgently needs to be promoted now, and it should be actively rewarded and there is no need to be passively banned.</p>
<p>(6) Jin Zhaojun explained that there are rewards in the method.</p>
<p>(7) Peng Baichuan proposed a revision to [Private Physical Education School Should be Separately Rewarded or Banned]. Bin Lai Geng and others seconded the proposal. This case was established.</p>
<p>(8) Du Longyuan said that the original [Excellent schools should be given rewards by the government should be added.</p>
<p>(9) Sun Mingxiu said that the bonus is within the scope of the regulations and is regulated separately. (10) Chen Mengyu said that all items are regulated in the regulations, not just expenses, and should not be deleted.</p>
<p>(11) The chairman put the amendment [Private Physical Education School Should be Separately Rewarded or Banned] to a vote, and the majority voted in favor.</p>
<p>(12) The chairman announced that there are no discussions on the methods. Please speak.</p>
<p>(13) Chen Mengyu and Xu Yusheng advocated that there should be regulations to commend excellent physical education schools.</p>
<p>(14) The chairman asked Director Chen Shizhen, "Does the Ministry of Education have any regulations on the regulations for special physical education schools?" Chen replied, "The Ministry of Education only has the Organizational Law for Special Schools and the Regulations for Special Schools, and there are no regulations for special physical education schools."</p>
<p>(15) Du Longyuan said, "Please follow the regulations of Hebei Women's Normal College for the reward methods."</p>
<p>(16) A member asked, "Should the Ministry of Education first issue the regulations for the establishment of private physical education schools?" Chen Shizhen replied, "The Ministry of Education already has the [Regulations for Private Schools], and special physical education schools do not need special regulations."</p>
<p>(17) Peng Baichuan proposed adding (3) to the method "Private physical education schools with excellent performance and outstanding achievements shall be specially rewarded by the government." The original methods (3) and (4) are changed to (4) and (5) in order, and passed without objection.</p>
<p>The full text of this case is as follows:</p>

<p>(2) Strictly screen private physical education schools.</p>
