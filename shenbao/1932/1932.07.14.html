<h3>縣長</h3>
<p>彬·</p>
<p>報載十二晨蔣介石氏在漢總部召見鄂縣長四十二人個别垂詢各地政情之後。並致訓話謂。「縣爲自治單位縣長爲親民之官縣長力量可抵一萬兵。應在政治上力謀改造。顧責任。顧廉恥。」末更云。「現匪情猖獗佔城市。截鐵路。政府駐軍視爲平常。這是縣長莫大的恥辱」蔣氏於戎馬倉促之際。尙能注意及縣政。其所訓示亦多切要之言·由可知政治當局。固亦未始無刷新政治之願。空谷跫音。誠足令吾人耳目爲之一新。雖然。蔣氏之言。容尙未盡其意。爰陳所見。藉廣其言。</p>
<p>「縣爲自治單位。縣長爲親民之官。」誠已灼見縣長地位之重要。惟其重要。故縣長而責民生乃得安。社會之秩序乃能定。縣長而不肖。則民困如水火。而呼　無門。社會亦日即於破落與動盪之途。蔣氏所望一縣長力量可抵一萬兵。實則兵之爲用。尙僅在於「鎭壓。」「鎭壓」不可以安民。適足以擾民。縣長賢。則一縣之民。皆得其所。皆安其生。武力無所用。反之。則民怨所積。亂機斯伏。武力又安所施。故縣長力量。可抵一萬兵力之語。實猶未足以喻縣長關係國本民生之重大也。</p>
<p>雖然。政治之臧否。實不僅繋於縣長個人。而繋於整個之政治組織何以言之。政治爲一整個之機搆。互相關聯。如機器然。必全部健全。而後乃能靈活。進行無碍。縣長如一螺旋。其所關固極重要。但果使僅一螺旋發生障碍。則易一螺旋。固易事也。若機器之全部皆不靈活。甚且殘損不全則獨歸咎於一螺旋。究復奚益。政治亦然。整個之政治組織如健全。則一縣之政治必健全。不肖之縣長即根本不容立足。反之。如整個之政治　敗黑暗。上而無良好之指導。且日予以不良之刺激。甚且逼使走上貪污枉法殘民禍國之途。下而豪紳團防。日相引誘。導使爲惡。政治上無是非。無公道。甚且政发賄成。官職皆有私相授受。整個之政治爲貪污。爲混亂。爲黑暗。則賢縣長亦根本無由立足良懦者隨世沉浮。不肖者則更恣意爲惡。此亦爲勢所必然。換言之。即必先省政府之政治清明。而後賢縣長乃能安於其位。不肖者無由而立足更進一步言。又必有健全之中樞政府。而後各省政府乃得健全。各省之政治乃得澄清。自中央以至一縣。一脈相貫息息相關。不可隔離。脱整個之政治混亂不清。而獨責縣長之「不顧廉恥。」「不盡責任。」是則何異於捨本逐末責備雖嚴。寗其有濟。以故今日與其督責各縣之縣長。何如先整飭整個之政治。與其責縣長盡責任。何如使中央先盡其責任。脱日一縣長可當一萬兵力。則中樞政府。當更可當百萬雄師。匪情猖獗。固爲縣長之恥。但獨不爲中央之恥乎。是則吾人所敢舉以　諸蔣氏。亦即所以廣蔣氏未盡之言也。</p>
<p>吾人所言。初非無所依據。今請舉一實事爲例安徽巢縣。邇近發生縣長鎗殺平民八九人之慘案。起因爲由於省政府勒種烟苗。而縣長則又逢迎省主席意旨。親往鄕間催索烟捐。人民怨苦久積。聞縣長之來。以爲可以直訴苦况。冀得拯拔。遂欣然命一盲者嗚鑼集衆。攔輿訴苦。然而苦未得訴。且恰以逢縣長之怒。在排鎗横掃之下。人民竟慘死八九人。此一幕慘劇之造成。固由於縣長之不肖。但嚮使省政府而能嚴厲禁烟。退一步言。即不獎勵種烟。則縣長何至逢迎意旨。以致造成此駭人聞聽之慘案。（見六月一日大公報劉震東君中國人民的經濟痛苦一文）</p>
<p>此一案件。要其一例。實則今日之縣長。大抵皆爲地方軍閥之私人。或由於人力者之推荐。或竟由於賄買。其眞由於考試或實續者殆百無一二。推荐者有所恃而無恐。賄賣者則更本爲搜括而來。其殘民禍國。自有其必然。整個之政治而不清明。則各縣之政治决無清明之日。舉目滔滔。濁流排空。民苦日深。民怨日積。變亂滋生。實非偶然。吾人有感乎蔣氏澄清政治之始意。但吾人更切盼政治當局能正本清源。重尊政治之新基。</p>

<h3>世界運動會之過去與現在</h3>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>（八）歷届大田徑賽之回顧（中）</p>
<p>第五届　雖然、以上數會、均未脱離形時代、眞正名副其實之世界亞林匹克運動會、當以一九0八年英國倫敦之第五届大爲其端、是會項目、增至二十三種、大半節目、均創新紀錄、坎拿大·南菲洲及瑞典之一嗚驚人、尤足使大會生色不少、美國於百米二百米逢其第一遭之失利、美選手於徑賽、僅勝八百米千五百米及馬拉松高欄中欄、顯巴特之八百米僅費時一分五二秒八、此項成績、歷久無人打破、至一九二六年時、始被德國貝爾則醫生在史丹福橋重創一新紀錄、而弗浪那根之連勝三次抛鏈錘勝利、尤足紀念者、是會閉幕、美國依舊不失冠軍地位、惟英國選手成續猛進、首次予美選手以劇烈之競爭、</p>
<p>第六届　是會於一九一二年在瑞典京城史篤克霍爾舉行、其莊嚴宏偉之開幕典禮、爲歷届所未有、運動結果、復產生不少之世界新紀錄、若百米二百米之克雷（美）、八百米之茂雷迪斯（美）、千五百米之傑克遜（英）、五千米一萬米之枸爾梅尼（芬蘭）、均有驚人之傑作、此僅就往賽言之、若言田賽、則跳遠爲二十五呎弱、撑竿跳幾及十三呎、標槍達二百呎許、鐵餅達百五十呎左右、鉛球超過五十呎、一九０八年未遭打破之紀錄僅四次耳、以美國常勝軍之威風、加以後起者如芬蘭瑞典諸國選手之猛進、致造成世界亞林匹克運動會成績之尖端化、一般熱心人士、羣以爲下届一九一六年中、必有不可思議之成績岀現矣、</p>
<p>歐戰時　詎知好事多磨、大戰爆發、一般健兒遂無睱於田徑塲中爭一百之長、去而臨沙塲、作于城已、一九一六年原定在德國柏林議行之第七届亞林匹克大會、遂被歐戰彈灰而消滅矣、</p>
<p>第七届　自歐戰以後、歐洲諸小國創鉅深痛、不得不積極提倡體育、以鍛練國民體格以至一九二０年在比利時京城安脱惠布恢復之第七届大會中、芬蘭選手、異軍突起、造成世界亞林匹克運動會之特殊局面、而同時因受戰事影響致成績落後者、猶大有人在、一進一退致造成平均之局面、劇烈之競爭、田賽中之撑竿跳高達四米０九、標槍爲六五米七八、均開世界新紀錄、坎拿大托姆遜之百十米高欄僅　時十四秒八、尤足駭人目視者、厥爲一九一二年之老英雄芬蘭柯爾梅尼捲土重來、勝馬拉松跑、且縮短前紀錄十三秒稱、芬蘭納米於斯會中初露頭角、得五千米及萬米越野跑冠軍、渠日後跑一英里至五英里、均開世界紀錄、如探囊取物、</p>

<h3>詩讖</h3>
<p>奇怪！唐代詩人杜牧之，竟是一個先知家！他的本領和李淳風劉伯温差不多；他做的一首秋夕詩，也和推背圖，燒餅歌，有同様的神秘！</p>
<p>丨丨銀燭秋光冷畫屏，輕羅小扇撲流螢；天階夜色冷如水，臥看牽牛織女星。這一首詩不是人人都讀得爛熟的麽？只道是，詠的大唐年間的秋夕！誰知不然，却是詠的民國二十一年北平地方的秋夕，他老人家是對於北平當局大捕電影明星有感而詠的詩。</p>
<p>電影明星全仗在銀幕上熱閙，現在變做了銀燭秋光冷畫屏，銀幕冷落，可想而知了；這是第一句的詩讖。</p>
<p>流螢是什麽？當然是明星了。古人詩句中，都把螢火比星；什麽騰空類星愪，什麽星散欲陵前檻月，這都是確證。牧之説的輕羅小扇撲流螢，便是説大捕明星，輕羅的羅字，是借映羅網的羅字··大批明星，很輕易的都入羅網，眞呌做輕羅小扇撲流螢了；這是第二句的詩讖。</p>
<p>北平是舊日帝王之都，天階二字，大槪便指着天牢吧；這個階字，是階下囚的意思。男明星女明星一齊被捕，男星，當然是牽牛；女星，當然是織女；天牢的階下，秋凉如水，看這男女明星臥在裏面，可憐不可憐呢？這便是第三四句的詩讖。</p>
<p>奇哉怪哉，杜牧之先生可和淳風伯温拜得把子，在那預言家裏面，成爲鼎足而三。</p>
<h3>肉鬆創始之述聞</h3>
<p>— 碧城</p>
<p>某日乘汽船自安亭赴太倉。船中有兩人。口操太倉鄕音。岀酒對酌。佐以鄕味肉鬆。且飲且談。津津有味。客問肉鬆風行遐邇。據云創始太倉倪鴻順。今雖上海商埠之廣大。賣肉鬆者。亦且掛倪鴻順之老牌。猶之老三珍陸稿荐之醬鴨醬肉。非用此牌號。不足发標高貴之格。倪鴻順之肉鬆。亦猶是乎。飲者一人停杯答曰。固也。然而創始肉鬆。並非倪鴻順。蓋赫然一有聲政界之大員實創之。其人爲誰。則太倉錢調甫中丞諱鼎銘者是。錢公當同治初年。蘇常淪陷之日。以舉人代表蘇松太各屬。請兵於兩江總督曾公。曾公乃派李公鴻章率師從上海入手。遂以肅清各屬。錢公亦遂投筆從戎。其後官至湖南巡撫。聞是時撫院官廚中。頗多調味高手。善創新食品。不拘拘舊法。惜未經仿傚隨園老人。著一食譜。以嘉惠老　。然即此肉鬆一味。使太倉特享盛名。又大有造於倪氏。成績已不爲不美矣。按肉鬆製法。有特殊秘訣。據云須用蛇油。可使日久不壤。儲於器中。無庸抽去空氣。與今之罐頭食物相籌矣。又奇者。旣用蛇油。能辟蚊蠅。推此理也。微生物或不易滋長其中乎。至於味之鮮美。亦以用蛇油之故。聞錢公退歸林下。常製肉鬆以餉客。則岀鴻順之手。鴻順蓋嘗隨公湘省日久。頗解烹調。公歸。授以製肉鬆之法。其後公没。鴻順乃岀其技。設一肉鬆攤。即用已之姓名。印紙作牌號。年餘。積資稍豐。遂租屋設店舗。年復一年。生意隆盛。今則開張於通都大邑。蓋其子若孫矣。惟仍用蛇油與否。則不可得而知。太倉雖創始處。今不甚考究。然猶以倪鴻順三字爲招徠主顧之牌號。將來或更用起首第一家等字様。勢所必至也。客聞而唯唯。余乃筆述之。以備編　鄕土史者之采擇。</p>
<h3>奇特的生產方法</h3>
<p>— 檳榔</p>
<p>最近有一位朋友自俄京來信，説起俄國自第二期五年計劃實行後，全國上下，無分男女，各專其職，努力於生產事業的推進，這種勤儉艱苦的精神，很値得敬仰。他説在蘇俄雖是一莖草，一合土，也不輕易廢棄；凡可以利用爲工業原料的，到處搜求，無微不至。譬如近今研究利用［狗毛］，也値得注意。當局統計國内所有［狗］的總數，計二千五百萬頭，這許多狗，每年可供給二千噸狗毛，如許巨量的狗毛，在五年計劃中的毛織業，有不少補助。所以通令全國，勸人民剪除狗毛，它的大意説··大凡畜類，身披長毛，到了夏季，熱度增加，氣喘不已，狗是有益人類的家畜，應當剪除其毛，照價岀售，不但狗的衛生有益，而於工業原料上，更可增加不少的產額。因此蘇俄全國的落毛狗，幾於觸目皆是，統計狗毛的增加，自然不在少數，那種生產方式，眞是别開生面的了。</p>
<h3>關於女人</h3>
<p>— 流沙</p>
<p>月經的代詞［月經］，被一般女子所諱言，而以各式各様不同的詞頭代替，據許歐氏説··［在拉丁民族和絛頓民族中間，月經這名稱普通是用相等的名稱［花］代替的，因爲花象徵着結實的可能。］又據都忒氏説··［有些未開化民族行經時則謂［帶上鹿皮］，或［岀去］這類的話。］</p>
<p>德國女子在行經時用一句成語··［我又有信了，］或是［姑母到了］。中國女子在行經時則謂··［身中來了］，或是［親家母來了。］但中國的女學生們則常以Ｍence或Ｂad　Days代替。</p>
<p>女人的褲子　在中國的古代，女人們非但日間穿着褲子，就是夜間睡覺時都不肯脱下的，而所謂上等女人的褲子呢？睡時結得更緊了。可是在西洋，情形可就不同了，原來褲子是東方的着物，似乎是從威尼司流行到歐洲去的。歐洲方面首先採用的大抵是娼妓，據説如果有人問一個農家女子穿褲子没有？伊會嚷道··［難道我會穿褲子嗎？馬丹！我是一個正經的姑娘囉！］據謀希爾氏一七八三年岀版的書裏説··巴黎女子，除女伶之外，並不穿褲子。自然，這種風氣在現在已改變了。</p>

<p>鄭孝胥之得名也。初不以書。復不以詩。世獨以善書工詩稱之。斯固然矣。而於清季政事之起伏。固數數預謀。實一政客也。壬午舉於鄕。官中書。恥爲下僚。有去志。語人曰。仕宧而任徵秩。無日不趨承上司。在外猶得温飽。居内有貧不能自存者。吾不欲久於其位矣。遂去。改官江蘇。後以領事駐神户。孝胥之接交日人自此始。鄂督張之洞耳其名。招入幕。且疏稱其才堪大用得旨賞道員。當時湖北官塲言必稱鄭總文案。其勢可見矣。之洞宿交王仁堪（可莊）第幾子某。以通判指省。思入督幕自表　。梁節菴（鼎芬）爲言於之洞。之洞默然。固請。怒斥之。某營進甚亟。不得請不休。嘗以此栺告鼎芬。鼎芬曰。必報。會有事詣制府。如前言。孝胥適在座。之洞俟其辭畢。恚曰。吾幕非人材。某或未能也。子掌兩湖書院。待人治事。盍引爲助。鼎芬唯唯。孝胥　言曰。師之言。余獨不謂然。天下人之文章。孰若師。天下之公牘。孰若師爲它人之記室易。爲音師之記室難。惟其難也。某必欲得之。將以求學耳。可莊固材士。其子當是通品。不可不察。語已。以目視鼎芬。鼎芬日。蘇堪妙語。實獲我心。欲言而未敢岀口。之洞微笑曰。蘇堪言婉而諷。節菴亦復言外有意。不從。二子必皆不悦。從則當試某以事。容吾熱審之。未五日。令下。人情好褒惡貶。之洞何莫不然。孝胥善於詞令。使鼎芬累求而不得者。寥寥數語諧其事。誠解人也。</p>

<p>朱先生以爲在這尙武的環境中，小孩子最好是先上一套尙武的功課，學做一個小小兵。他提議敎小孩子幾手拳。這是容易辦的。張師傳雖然敎了不久，但是已經找着十幾位很有希望的大徒弟。他們也要拉我充數做一個小孩子的拳術敎師。我們這十幾個人是足敷分配了，用不着張師傳自已煩神。你們想一想，當那些小小拳頭在草地上揮來揮去，親戚朋友看見是多麽夠味兒的一件事啊！</p>
<p>五十六</p>
<p>［小孩們是來讀書，那能老是打拳？］一般不懂事的人或者要這様説。朱先生和我不約而同的。已經預料到這一點。當他呌我去呌小學生來看書認字的時候正是我要向他上絛陳。我知道自已的見解不錯，心中很歡喜。這是朱先生自已寫的幾課文。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>小小兵，</p>
<p>勸你莫看輕。</p>
<p>你若欺中國，</p>
<p>小命和你拼。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>小小兵，</p>
<p>愛打抱不平。</p>
<p>我們起來了，</p>
<p>不用再招兵。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>小小兵！</p>
<p>問··［你要學雖？］</p>
<p>［别人都不學，</p>
<p>但願學缶飛！］</p>
<h3>雙紅豆</h3>
<p>— 吳東園</p>
<p>申報今年六十周紀念。因憶蔡紫黻鄒酒丐天南遯叟高昌寒食生諸老。先後捐館。今雨王鈍根陳栩園周瘦鵑三君。廿年心契。千里神交。賦此藉呈一粲。並祝申報館萬年。</p>
<p>周草窗。吳夢窗。兩地相思紅豆雙。溯洄黄浦江。翰墨塲。翰墨香。一紙風行萬里長。文章日月光。</p>
<p>句迎杜伶因承申報披露</p>
<p>茲再賦七章以送其去</p>
<p>（三晋舊使）</p>
<p>難消夢幻影紛紛。悶遣問吟杜麗雪。不必瞻言知汝狀。孝思何只愧釵裙。擬將睜眼戯逢塲。覓座差池願未償。翻免散塲兼恐怖。法門震動失王郎。蘇三代寫澀珠喉。或覺王孫感有羞。名盛例宜增折鍊。呌天津市亦空樓。悟透歡嬉卽禍胎。寄寃怪變亦奚猜。劇中幻化須叟事。劇外何如幻化來。無限吟篇豁兩眸。不知按劍亦珠投。虎頭痴惯昂頭甚。只對芳情鐵骨柔。浹旬詩境異前懹。另換魔來另様排。大妙無如游戯境。鎖　只可到形骸。初窺道旨合參禪。綺語忘删卽佛仙。仙佛何曾删綺語。甘甜妙諦舌生運。</p>

<h3>匯市明緊暗平</h3>
<p>昨銀市回跌、匯兌英降美升、歐市堅而復軟、本埠匯豐各匯均已回縮半檔、計英金一二五、爲一先令七便士六二五、美金二五、爲二十九元、香港仍計七十八兩、餘均略縮、殆當日成交價稍形盤轉、結果比前日計英金未有更動、而美金縮一二五、至金價較漲六兩光晃、無如匯市明緊暗平、與上日似乎適反、而交易不寂、計英匯數萬鎊、大致銀行對做也、美金約有四五十萬元、金帮抛岀爲多、間有壽豐永等　回絛子、銀行如匯豐及華比三井等均有納進、又花旗銀公司賣岀九月英金、下午因逢週三、向例無市、</p>

<h3>大絛縮一八七五</h3>
<p>國民社十三日倫敦電、大絛縮風又勁、收盤近期十六便士十六分之十三、遠期十六便士八分之七、比上日各跌十六分之三、又倫敦對紐約匯價開三元五角五分四分之一、</p>
<h3>厘拆漲風狂驟</h3>
<p>此次洋厘漲風、純被改洋本位之聲浪所激而成、銀行方面爲準備起見、相率爭購、卒至逐步上騰、每日遞次加昂、迄於昨日更爲狂驟、較前日已高昂三厘光景、銀拆亦以外商銀行吸收現欵以致市上活動之現籌碼、頓感拮据、劃頭加水居然暴騰、是誠炎夏時期例外之變動、而亦今年之所創舉焉</p>
<p>厘拆漲勢均劇　［洋厘］早市厘價爲六錢九分八厘、較前日早市改昂二厘八毫七忽半午市微軟一毫二忽半、爲六錢九分七厘八毫七忽半［銀拆］早市一錢一分較前日高上二分午市續高四分、而爲一錢五分形勢甚爲堅挺、故劃頭加水驟昂至二錢五分之巨、開本月中未有之昂價銀行掛牌乃亦有四分行情、</p>
<p>輔幣中廣角漲　江南小洋、因前日過高、是以昨日回落早市爲六錢零八厘較小一厘、午市爲六錢零七厘、計續跌一厘、交易早市三千五百角、午市四千角廣東小洋、早市爲五錢九分一厘半、午市爲五錢九分一厘七毫半、較前日頓高四厘之譜、交易早市十四萬角、午市六萬五千角、銅元續縮一千文爲四百十四千文、交易僅三萬四千七百餘串文</p>

<p>近月人標比</p>
<p>現紗低落五六兩</p>
<p>棉紗市情仍屬平靜、但現紗銷路平澹、各廠現貨、因被滇粤兩帮購去不少、故目前根子趨緊、查七月份標紗價資較外面現紗價低五六兩、因之廠方交貨心意甚懈、但有一紗廠大約交岀二千包、其他未聞、所以金融暗中雖仍緊急、然買方態度依然挺秀、惟多數賣方視外棉不振、一致抛賣、故壓力尙重、前途殊不敢必也、</p>
<p>人標漲跌甚微人前市開盤、以美棉趨落、市盤七跌八·九錢、二三盤步步回漲、結果近漲一·三錢、遠跌二·四錢、午後形勢又見和緩、各月微跌二·三·四錢、全日成交統計一萬九千一百包、查賣岀瑞大九百包、達記六百包、明德八百五十包、遠大五百五十包、買進廣豐一千一百五十包、長豐二千零五包、愼記六百包、茲將人標收盤價、分列如下、</p>

<h3>棉市多空兩難</h3>
<p>日商有搜羅現棉説</p>
<p>棉市始跌繼平、但美棉狀况、又見疲落、故信誠步步抛岀、一般散户逢跌吸進、查其原因、謂金市仍難大跌、而日商某棉行在市大批搜羅現棉、據一部份云、所中七月份標棉、賣方交岀之貨、已有數百件、被日商購去矣、於是商塲做多者較衆、但測之大勢狀况、棉市仍處於不景氣中、惟本棉底貨太枯、加之日商作梗、前途殊乏把握也、</p>
<p>鄭標跌後稍回　鄭標前市開盤、以美棉又跌、大户抛岀、各跌五錢、二三盤又回漲、結果各跌二錢、午後市氣仍平、各月漲跌五分至一錢、全日成交統市五萬五千二百擔、查賣岀明德三千一百擔、信誠六千六百擔、同興一千二百擔、義餘一千一百擔、買進遠大四千五百擔、源大二千五百擔、榮興二千六百擔、德記二千三百擔、茲將鄭標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<p>六月中日本輸入之棉布及人造絲織物、其量額奇大、爲去年九月以來所未有、計三千一百０一包、較五月中之八百包、顯見鋭增、據稱均係定購品云、</p>
<p>[P糧食米市跌勢更厲&gt;</p>
<p>滬南　昨米市各帮來源約抵十餘號、城鄕消化呆滯、常錫北粳行情又短二尺、北　同里存底不厚、店胃寥寥、開盤降低尺半、早晚稻來貨略接寗胃仍細、本街動銷數十石、跟好近角、洋杜尖到銷兩微市歸疲象變陰元貨稀銷細、形居平穩、</p>
<p>新閘　昨米市内地來源尙湧、河積豐厚、市銷寂寞、人心看疲、厚粳行情跌落角許、中關宿次無人過問、甩落三角薄稻晨間交易極少、跟落近角蘆洋尖無所榮辱</p>
<h3>北帮續辦洋米</h3>
<p>期西貢新有回籠成交···行情續跌</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、尙稱活潑、因新有天津帮續辦、寗波本街内地鄕莊均有問津、市氣甚佳、行情反見小二角、蓋因目下天時炎熱、存米久貯恐防米質變壤、貨主均有贬價求脱之意、一有去路、隨跌價售去、故昨日天津辦去小絞一千包、本街内地等去小絞二千五百包、寗波帮去小絞一千五百包、而價則反小也、</p>
<p>期米久無交易、昨市上開岀西貢一號七月份一百噸、價四兩七錢、伹係行家回籍進岀、新交易則難以成議、此價合來亦祇十元稍零、與上次定進價格五兩二三錢比較、亦須虧折一元以上云、</p>
<h3>粉市重入疲境</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份復趨平疲之象、以洋麥報價、又小一三角左右不等、與去年之最低紀錄、已漸相近、人心不振、此爲最大主因、兼之阜豐等廠、仍陸續套岀、本月份標準、亦可抽買、故人心一面顧現貨之豐、一面又感國外市値之低落、因此人心平均趨疲、未能再振、觀國外之情形甚軟、大廠之　住、頗屬不合時宜也、結果七八月份各小七厘半、九月份小五厘、十十一月份不動、十二月份小七厘半云、</p>
<h3>小麥内地帮吸力尙强</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼好之象、本月份交易甚寂、價鮮上落、八九月份因抛户甚稀、内地吸户、則尙有力、因此市氣尙好、惟洋麥報價、步小不已、似終不宜過看好面也、結果本月份不動、八九月份較前日好二分、餘未動、現麥市面、略趨平落、因到源頗暢、廠胃則祇　應酬、開白鶴巷麥二兩六錢八分、常熟麥二兩八錢六分、吳淞麥二兩七錢、安亭麥二兩六錢八分、雙鳳麥二兩八錢、直塘麥二兩八錢、項橋麥二兩八錢三分、計二千餘包、由福新阜豐信大小去云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白交靜市挫</h3>
<p>同業有組織公賣説</p>
<p>昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤交易、初時買氣尙活、但吃價殊低、荷糖二十四號粗砂白、成交價爲十四兩三錢、旋同業宣佈財政部批准二三月份荷糖定貨、豁免新舊税則差價之半數、於是買方絕跡、市形轉弱、問津毫無、太古糖Ｂ麥十六兩三錢、ＤＹ麥十五兩五錢半、ＣＷ麥十五兩八錢、交易零落、趨勢平定、</p>
<p>又該業爲維持荷糖血本計、擬組織粗砂白等公賣情事、聞内部粗見就緒、已定今日開同業全體大會、徵求同業意見、决定辦法云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　洋莊絲銷仍無生氣</h3>
<p>歐美市塲、華絲跌度仍强、電轉寥落、華絲商手中陳絲虧蝕益鉅、内地綢廠因日絲廉價侵銷、絲銷亦不起、市氣疲滯、昨祇達昌進上身Ｂ級十三至十五絛份滬白廠經十包、價祇五百二十兩、三星等進過盆黄粗絲十五包、價自三百二十兩至二百八十五兩、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉歐銷大暢</h3>
<p>昨日婺東屯溪等路之珍眉綠茶、英莊恊和怡和錦降各大洋行、均已接到摩洛哥鉅額之定單、開始大舉搜辦、其他行家、亦多乘機購進、珍眉一項、全市成交共達三千餘箱、針眉珠茶各花色、交易均趨旺盛、沉悶已久之綠茶市面、頗有漸入佳境之勢、祁門紅茶、高莊貨去路已見活動、惟中低莊貨、市况依然呆滯云、</p>

<p>廢兩改元問題</p>
<p>昨日本報發表某君廢兩改元之談話、對於關稅外匯國内匯兌債務債權國幣紙幣諸端、均有論列、言簡意賅、足爲研究者之絕好資料、然廢兩改元、茲事體大、國内人士、固多數主張當機立斷、急遽進行、然亦有主張深思熟慮、并應預籌善後種種方法者、本報特再就主張愼重者之意見、爲之披露如次、</p>
<p>本日所發表意見之某君、爲上海銀銀業巨子、在滬經營事業數十年、其服務於現茲之莊號、亦逾十稔、對於金融事業、瞭如指掌、每臆輒中、凡所言者、亦或足爲他山攻錯之資乎某君曰、</p>
<p>於廢兩改元一事、主張積極者、固力促其成、主張消極者、亦復無庸反對、董此爲事實問題、但期改元之後、籌措裕如、不致直接摇動金融、間接擾及商業、斯爲要着、至於吾人之認爲應加注意者、姑試言之、知我罪我、初不計及也、</p>
<p>現茲上海爲用銀之市塲、（記者按此即所謂銀碼頭、）匪特錢業進岀、多以銀爲本位、即一切内地匯兌、亦多以銀兩相折算、况國外貿易、率用銀兩、而外商銀行、更從事收儲寳銀、以爲準備、故市塲交易、雖用銀元、而商業之進岀匯兌、均用銀兩、且上海爲每日現收現解之碼頭、收解之際、又向用銀兩、則銀兩於市塲上之勢力、可以想見、今茲一旦廢兩改元、則金融業之對於客户、以及金融業相互之收解、實有重要之關係、應加注意、惟國内外匯兌可按法價升算、則轉可無甚問題者也、</p>
<p>以云客户、現茲金融業中之存欵、洋户固多、銀户亦復不少、以上海之向爲銀碼頭、存户之存銀兩者、其提取時、亦必付之以銀兩、現茲廢兩改元、按例自然改給銀元、又相互收解、本用寳銀、今旣改元、則亦當以銀元相收解矣、</p>
<p>本來上海爲銀碼頭、且中國國幣銀元、向屬不敷應用、（記者按目前上海市塲、以存銀元號稱二萬萬、事實或不過一萬五六千萬兩、）現茲所流行之硬貨、事實上所含純銀、不及七錢、而用爲市價七錢以上（價有升降、即爲洋釐、）之代表、又因劣幣之驅逐良幣、勢所必然、故　洋江南湖北諸幣以及袁幣、現多爲人改鎔寳銀、每日多至數十萬元、（記者按改鎔　洋袁幣爲寳銀、按近日之洋釐計算、每萬元盈餘可近二百兩、）其結果流通市上之硬貨、實在其代表法價以下、信是一旦廢兩改元、用此等銀元、以爲廢兩之兌換品、存銀者寗非受其損失、此　特加注意者一也</p>
<p>又現茲硬貨不敷應用、人所共知、廢兩之後、圖濟硬貨之不足、自必行使紙幣、然而中國發行紙幣、已數十年、如湖北之官錢票·東三省之奉票等等、偶因事變、或已無形取消、或跌至不堪設想、人民持票者、所受損失、不可數計、今感於硬貨之不敷、而行使紙幣、則又必因而增加紙幣之發行額、在日常無事之秋、紙幣流通、固無不可、然萬一少有事變、因起風潮、則紙幣之信用、必且又生問題、往時以銀兩與銀元並存、且市塲流通、以銀兩爲主、準備之中、各存寳銀、尙足以銀兩清銀元之窮、今茲改元之後、元旣不敷、縱以紙幣、則紙幣之信用、一有問題、市塲之紛擾、更不待言矣、</p>
<p>爲今之計、廢兩改元、第一注意、即在銀元、簡要言之、應分兩點、</p>
<p>（一）銀元成色、銀元中所包含之純銀數、應與其所代表之價値相等、不得少有减損、至於法價規定、則政府自有權衡、可就所包含者制定之、例如每銀元所包含之純銀數爲六錢八分、則廢兩之際、每元之法價、不應高於六錢八分、倘使法價與純銀吻合、則廢兩改元、存銀者不致虧耗、</p>
<p>（二）添鑄硬貨、現茲硬貨不敷流通、一旦廢兩遂感不便、故政府應即時添鑄硬貨、務使源源接濟、足敷全國市塲之流通、而不必有待於紙幣、信能硬幣充足、成色一律、則現貨足敷兌換、銀兩自可取銷、决無問題者矣、</p>
<p>又鑄造硬貨、自非於極短時間所易足用、而不能不暫用紙幣、其於紙幣、亦應更有嚴密之規定、</p>
<p>（一）發行定額、於今發行紙幣之銀行、固有定額、而其發行總額、則以流通之多寡相升降、一旦廢兩、紙幣之需要大增、其有發行權者、自必因需要之增進、而增加發行、然增加較多、數無定額、信用雖佳、安得家喻而户曉之、最好、應由各行量度自身之能力、規定一發行總額、無論如何、發行不逾此額、則社會知其銀行之力量、足以負擔、其發行信用自增、流通益暢矣、</p>
<p>（二）嚴密檢查、現今發行紙幣者、多已實行檢查制度、將來廢兩以後、紙幣流通、關係全國者匪細、應更以極端之公開、行嚴密之檢查、而負檢查之責者、尤應知於民生國命所依托、務宜不憚辛勤、不懷瞻徇、舉凡準備之現貨證券、逐一親加點查、以昭大信、則紙幣之信用增、流通之力量廣矣、</p>
<p>總之、廢兩改元、須先有充分之準備、以及預籌之方法、俾改制之後、人民無絲毫之不便、分釐之損失、而以後更無糾紛之發生、則人民之所屬望、尤金融業所應負之責任、期與國人、共相淬勉、俾獲促成、馨祝以之、</p>

<p>上海租界每石增一元四角五</p>
<p>高下有五種二元七者加一角</p>
<p>淞區增收後年可多入五十萬</p>
<p>國聞社云、財政部長宋子文、整理鹽稅、提議整理產區鹽稅暫行稅率、經中央政治會議通過、現財部已開始實行、第一期整理區域、爲兩浙松江·淮南·淮北·長蘆·五區·上海爲松江區所屬、故昨日記者特趨松江鹽運副使公署訪問、所得詳情如下、</p>
<p>松區鹽政　松江運使轄蘇常鎭太松五屬、松屬川南寳及租界均屬之、舊時鹽稅稅率、高下不一、嗣經稽核所整頓後、以淞區言、每石捐稅二元七角、有十八縣、三元二角有六縣、但松江產鹽稅率、仍舊、迄今有三元二·二元七·一元五·一元六角五種、全區每年產銷三百萬石、租界二十萬石、全部收入年約四五百萬元、</p>

<h3>暑期中底義務工作</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>現在已是七月初了，學校方面，大半已經放暑假；但是我對於度暑假中最合學生方面去做的事情，臚列於左，以供學界之研究。</p>
<p>（一）發行印品　現在岀版的新書新報，雖然很多，但總限於局部，不能普遍全體·存統説，［現在的文化運動是貴族式的文化運動，］這話很是沈痛·不過我想就是貴族方面實在也不能普及·這種很偏狹很微弱的文化運動，我想前途很少樂觀的；我們看到這點，不得不想些方法補救·這個暑假期，就給我們一個好機會，去做那竭力宣傳文化底事業·假使我們發行了一種淺近的印刷物，發表些和他們很切身的文章；一方面再從同學方面搜羅有價値有興味的文章，給他們看看；不但能夠使他們發生興味，而且還可以引導他們著作的增進呢·不過發行這種印刷品，也有好多應該注意的地方，不妨約略寫幾絛岀來·印刷，能夠辦得到鉛印，固然最好，否則油印也不妨，總之，只要看得清楚就是了。</p>
<p>裝訂，假使鉛印的，不妨照禮拜六報格式，油印的，最好釘成小册子，使看的人不容易失掉。</p>
<p>取價，能夠完全送閲，一錢也不取最好·萬一經濟困難，也應該取最底限度的價格，因爲我們辦這種報，完全要抱犧牲主義的。</p>
<p>材料，當然要着重在平民身上，使他們有一種階級的覺悟·多商人的地方，不妨多做些關於商友覺悟學徒解放底文章··多農民工人底地方，那就多做些關係農人工人方面底文章，總之，因地制宜，務求切實·</p>
<p>文體，完全用白話，使人人都明白·</p>
<p>署名，一槪不署，免得别人説我們岀風頭··發表文章底責任，總該由主辦底共同負責·</p>
<p>（二）暑期義務學校　要改良現在社會，那一個不曉得先要敎育普及；要敎育普及，又那一個不曉得推廣義務學校·可是義務學校！這個呼聲，閙了這好多年頭，開辦的究竟有幾處呢？在都市上免强找得到幾處，鄕村中簡直毫無影響！諸位啊！我們切不可專尙空談，還是脚踏實地盡力去做罷·我們底鄕下，至少總要有一二所義務小學校，器具向地方上小學裏借用，房子也可以向地方小學校房屋借用，設備，房金都可以省去了·只要我們一天費幾個鐘頭，便可使那般無智識的同胞，得着一個識字求學的機會·</p>
<p>（三）實行勞動　我們天天談勞動神聖的話，看勞動神聖的書；但試問，我們對於勞動一事，究竟自已能夠實行一點没有？那眞慚愧得很呢！我主張洗衣服咧，清潔道路咧······這許多事情，一定個個要去實行，不是單單省幾個錢，少用幾個傭人，並且可以練習我們底筋骨；實行我們勞動主義，打破少爺阿官神聖底招牌·還有一層，我們假使能夠集合幾個同學·借這個時期，去做共同生活；一切食物，大家自已去燒，自已去預備，這様非但能夠養成獨立的性格，而且還可生岀許多興趣呢！</p>

<h3>避難</h3>
<p>— 吳雨蒼</p>
<p>本年三月二日，爲日機轟炸所脅，　同老幼，輾轉遷避，於十八日抵沙溪鎭北沈店橋，　居蘇姓農家，陸續得時，錄示友好，用告所遭。撲被記征程，居停已數更，風光何黯澹，時節正清明，亂世復奇歉，老農猶苦耕，慙予徒鋪餟，無計利民生。避宼倉皇至，相逢盡故人，慇懃留飲食，笑語慰艱辛，忍見　痍满，難禁涕淚頻，興亡同有責，愧此却餘身。桃源何處是，差幸得幽居，市遠賓朋少，風醇禮節疏，妄談留野老，健飯愛新蔬，前路未堪問，浮生付太盧。流離雖失所，未足歎艱難，窮竄身翻建，荒居夢却安，籬邊時把卷，溪畔偶持竿，深愧偷閒逸，無才挽倒瀾。</p>
<p>又寄懹二弟雨霖</p>
<p>屈指别離已三月，一緘萬里寄相思，</p>
<p>燈前笑語常縈夢，刧裏風光半入詩，</p>
<p>孤館眠餐汝珍重，慈闈衰老我扶持，</p>
<p>江關杜宇聲聲喚，爲問歸舟可有期，</p>
<p>正是中年多感慨，又看時局亂如麻，</p>
<p>鬩牆兄弟工心計，伺𨻶豺狼吮血花，</p>
<p>孤憤一腔應撃楫，男兒四海可爲家，</p>
<p>天涯知否常相憶，今夜吟成月已斜。</p>
<p>科学</p>
<h3>波特蘭水泥</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>水泥和碎石及砂混合，成爲混凝土，於建築上用途很廣；而水泥的種類極多，其中最重要的，就是波特蘭水泥，今將其原料，成分，制法，及凝結，分述如下··</p>
<p>（一）原料　最通用的原料，是石灰石或泥灰石和黏土或板泥岩。</p>
<p>（二）成分　其主要成分的百分率，如下表··</p>
<p>石灰（ＣaO）　六０丨六四·五　平均六二·０</p>
<p>石英（ＳiO2）　二0丨二四·0　平均二二·0</p>
<p>礬土（AL2O3）　五丨九·0　平均七·五</p>
<p>苦土（M9O）　一丨四·0　平均二·五</p>
<p>氧化鐵（Fe2O3）　二丨四·0　平均二·五</p>
<p>三氧化硫（SO3）　一丨一·七五平均一·五</p>
<p>其中石灰和石英礬土苦土三者的百分率之比，約等於一·九至二·一；又石英和礬土的百分率之比，約爲二·五至四·這兩個比例，在製造水泥時，要非常注意的，因爲石灰過多，則水泥凝結時，將膨漲而破碎，石灰太少，則水泥凝結太慢，石英很多，則凝結很慢，礬土很多，則凝結很快。</p>
<p>（三）製造　將上述原料，照其成分混合，磨成細粉，裝入爐中燒之，（爐中温度約爲攝氏一四五至一六○度），燒至將近鎔點，此時所成的灰色小塊，呌做灰塊（Clinker），取岀冷却後，搗成粉末，但灰塊凝結很快，通常加入石膏，約爲灰塊重量的百分之二或三，和灰塊同時研細。石膏有阻止水泥凝結的作用，呌做負觸媒劑。</p>
<p>（四）凝結　水泥加水後，能變成堅硬如石的東西，因爲灰塊含有（ＣaＯ）２·ＳiＯ(CaO)3·SiO2(Cao)2·Ａl2O3及（ＣaＯ）3·Ａl2O3等成分，牠們和水接觸時，成含水物，此等含水物有結晶性·能變成硬塊。</p>
<h3>家道向題</h3>
<h3>大家庭的風味</h3>
<p>— 孟遠</p>
<p>沈公館在Ｐ鎭上，也算是一個數一數二的大家庭了！家中蓄着有許多老媽子，和丫婢··一呼百諾，眞是人類最快樂的生活了丨理宜他們所過的生活，很是舒爽融樂的；可是事實却與人相反着，他們的家中，常常發生許多糾紛。</p>
<p>據沈公館裏的人傳岀來説··吵閙的原因，都是爲着二奶奶，二奶奶是二少爺去年娶的，她是ＸＸ女子師範的畢業生，對於學問，想必是很宏博的了！可是她對於家庭問題，却一些也不懂，每日只是搽粉抺脂，呼奴喚婢，老太太，（十八世紀的老太太，）很不以爲然，她以爲娶媳婦，是來助理家政的，不會做事，有什麽用？難道是呌她是來吃飯白相的嗎？（她不知二十世紀的新式女子，都是這様，）因此背後就不免咕嚕了起來！</p>
<p>二奶奶眞是一個架子十足，新派的婦女，她每日除了搽粉抺脂，吃着之外，還要打牌叉麻雀··她把丈夫當作銀行，把家庭當作旅館，越是受過高深敎育的女人，越是如此。</p>
<p>所以沈老太太，背後常對人埋怨她，責斥她，説她只是每日吃着，穿着，玩着，對於家中的事情，一些也不懂，甚至連大人都不曉得，我地方一次也没有請過安，眞是一個没有受過禮敎的女人。］</p>
<p>二奶奶她是如何一個高傲的人，聽了這話，那得不氣，因此也常常咒咀，説［老太太是個老古董，老糊塗，是現在二十世紀的蠢物，自已每日有得吃，有得穿，也夠舒齊了，還要呌人來管理什麽家政不家政？</p>
<p>這様一來·婆媳間勃谿的烈痕，越加深了，新近二奶奶歸去，沈老太太却欣然説··［她一岀去，我倒可以安靜過日了！］</p>
<p>後來二少爺來信，呌她（二奶奶）到Ｓ埠去，二奶奶也不回家説明，竟自到Ｓ埠去了！</p>
<p>在Ｓ埠住了二月之久，二少爺要回鄕來望望家中，而二奶奶不肯同來，他也没有法子，只得任她去了！</p>
<p>呀！這就是所謂呼奴喚婢的大家庭的風味啊！</p>
<p>社会的一角</p>
<h3>趁火車的敎訓</h3>
<p>— 月中小殘</p>
<p>［火車快來了！］一個衣黄制服的路警這様地喊着，他接連的對一個西裝客人説··喂！先生！請走進一步，火車來了，要撞倒的呢？</p>
<p>鳴············鳴············在每個乘客的耳鼓裏都聽得火車遠遠的近來了，放在地上的物件，也很有秩序的都提在手上，預備着車停了站，即刻上去，招個舒服的位子·</p>
<p>吱哺·········吱哺·········車靠站了，在第三節車上的茶房從事窗内伸岀頭來喊着［後頭］［後頭空］·可是乘客們也不管是前頭後頭，只是爭先恐後的擠上去·</p>
<p>同行的同學們，在這一刹那也分散了，只有領導的謝先生和我還在一塊兒</p>
<p>［你聽得嗎！茶房説後頭空呢？我們向後走好吧！］謝先生這様的問我·</p>
<p>［好，好，我們向後走，好在乎後頭空呀；］我順便回了一句·</p>
<p>到了一節Ｉ後的一節ＩＩＩ，車窗内同様的伸岀頭來喊着［後頭］［後頭空］，我們依着他的指揮，再向後的走了二節，都是ＩＩ等，可是走一節有個茶房伸岀頭來同様的喊着，［後頭］［後頭空］直走到末了的一節，還是這様的喊着［後頭］［</p>
<p>後頭空］·這時我們實在走得揮汗如雨了，不能再走</p>
<p>鳴···的一聲，車也動了，我們只得勉强跳上末了的一節，一旦上了車，事實告訴我們，茶房却是個忠實的指導者</p>
<p>［上擋了丨上擋了丨我們早上了前面的車子不是很好，茶房説［後頭空］，空在那裏，糟糕，糟糕，］謝先生這様的懊悔説着·</p>
<p>［唉！眞的，我們上擋了，走了許多路，岀了好多汗，招不到一個位子、還是插臘燭，但是我們這次吃了虧，下次學些乖就是了。］</p>

<p>Reports indicate that on the morning of the 12th, Chiang Kai-shek summoned 42 county magistrates from E province at his headquarters in Hankou, individually inquiring about the political situations in their respective regions. He also delivered an address, stating: "The county is a unit of self-governance, and the county magistrate is an official close to the people. The strength of a county magistrate can be equivalent to 10,000 soldiers. Efforts should be made to transform politics, considering responsibility and integrity." He further stated, "Currently, the bandit situation is rampant, occupying cities and cutting off railways. The government and stationed troops treat this as commonplace. This is the greatest shame for the county magistrates." Despite the hurried circumstances of military affairs, Chiang was still able to pay attention to county administration, and his instructions were pertinent. It is evident that the political authorities do indeed have a desire to refresh politics. This rare sound in an empty valley is truly refreshing. However, Chiang's words may not have fully expressed his intentions. Therefore, I offer my views to expand upon his words.</p>
<p>"The county is a unit of self-governance, and the county magistrate is an official close to the people." This truly reflects the importance of the county magistrate's position. Precisely because of its importance, only when the county magistrate is concerned about the people's livelihood can they be secure, and only then can social order be established. If the county magistrate is unworthy, the people will suffer like they are in water and fire, and there will be no way to appeal for help. Society will also gradually move towards decline and unrest. Chiang's hope that the strength of a county magistrate can be equivalent to 10,000 soldiers is, in fact, still only focusing on "suppression." "Suppression" cannot bring peace to the people; it only serves to disturb them. When the county magistrate is virtuous, all the people in the county will have what they need, and they will all live in peace. There will be no need for military force. Conversely, if popular resentment accumulates, a crisis will be triggered. Where can military force then be applied? Therefore, the statement that the strength of a county magistrate can be equivalent to 10,000 soldiers does not fully convey the importance of the county magistrate's relationship to the foundation of the nation and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>However, the quality of politics does not depend solely on the county magistrate as an individual, but on the entire political organization. How can this be explained? Politics is a complete mechanism, interconnected like a machine. It must be fully functional to be flexible and run smoothly. The county magistrate is like a screw, and its role is extremely important. But if only one screw malfunctions, it is easy to replace it. If the entire machine is not functioning smoothly, or even damaged, what good would it do to blame only one screw? The same is true of politics. If the entire political organization is sound, then the politics of a county will surely be sound. An unworthy county magistrate would have no place to stand. Conversely, if the entire political situation is corrupt and dark, with no good guidance from above and even being subjected to negative stimuli on a daily basis, even forced onto the path of corruption, malfeasance, harming the people, and ruining the country. And from below, powerful gentry and local defense forces are constantly tempting and leading them to do evil. There is no right or wrong or justice in politics, and even bribery leads to official positions being privately transferred. If the entire political system is corrupt, chaotic, and dark, then a virtuous county magistrate would have no way to stand. The virtuous and weak drift with the tide, while the unworthy become even more unrestrained in their evil deeds. This is also inevitable. In other words, only when the politics of the provincial government are clear can a virtuous county magistrate be secure in his position and an unworthy one have no way to stand. Furthermore, only when there is a sound central government can the provincial governments be sound, and the politics of each province be clarified. From the central government down to a single county, everything is interconnected and inseparable. If the entire political system is in chaos and unclear, and only the county magistrate is blamed for "not considering integrity" and "not fulfilling responsibilities," is this not like abandoning the root and pursuing the branch? Blame, no matter how severe, will not be effective. Therefore, today, instead of supervising and blaming the county magistrates, how about first rectifying the entire political system? Instead of blaming the county magistrates for not fulfilling their responsibilities, how about making the central government fulfill its responsibilities first? If a county magistrate can be worth 10,000 soldiers, then the central government should be worth a million elite troops. Is the rampant bandit situation only the shame of the county magistrates, and not also the shame of the central government? This is what I dare to present to Chiang Kai-shek, and it is also how I expand upon what he has not fully expressed.</p>
<p>What I am saying is not without basis. Let me cite a specific example. Recently, in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, a tragic incident occurred in which the county magistrate shot and killed eight or nine civilians. The cause was that the provincial government forced the planting of opium seedlings, and the county magistrate catered to the wishes of the provincial chairman, personally going to the countryside to collect opium taxes. The people's resentment had been accumulating for a long time. Hearing of the county magistrate's arrival, they thought they could directly appeal their grievances and hope to be rescued. So, they gladly ordered a blind man to beat a gong to gather the crowd and block the carriage to voice their grievances. However, before they could voice their grievances, they incurred the wrath of the county magistrate. Under a barrage of gunfire, eight or nine people were tragically killed. The creation of this tragic scene was due to the unworthiness of the county magistrate. However, if the provincial government had strictly prohibited opium, or even if it had not encouraged the planting of opium, why would the county magistrate have catered to their wishes, leading to this shocking tragedy? (See Liu Zhendong's article "The Economic Suffering of the Chinese People" in the Dagong Bao, June 1st).</p>
<p>This case is just one example. In reality, today's county magistrates are mostly private individuals of local warlords, or recommended by powerful people, or even obtained through bribery. Very few are truly selected through examinations or practical experience. Those who are recommended have nothing to fear, and those who bought their positions are even more focused on extorting money. Their harming the people and ruining the country is inevitable. If the entire political system is not clear, there will be no clear politics in the counties. Everywhere you look, turbulent currents fill the air. The people's suffering deepens daily, and popular resentment accumulates. The emergence of unrest is no accident. I am touched by Chiang's initial intention to clarify politics, but I hope that the political authorities can address the root causes, clarify the sources and origins, and emphasize the new foundation of politics.</p>

<h3>Noulens (Ruegg) Case</h3>
<p>Transfer to Shanghai Unlikely</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Withdraws Guarantee</p>
<p>Court Only Approves Medical Treatment in Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of Noulens' transfer to Shanghai for medical treatment on bail, guaranteed by Soong Ching-ling and Cai Yuanpei, has suddenly changed. Luo Wengan and Zheng Tianxi believe that Noulens' release on bail violates the spirit of the rule of law and affects both legal principles and authority. They resigned in anger with a firm stance. Cai Yuanpei was quite disturbed upon learning that Luo and Zheng had resigned because of this case and feared that it would cause political disputes. He visited Noulens at the detention center again on the night of the 12th and expressed his regrets about guaranteeing his transfer to Shanghai for medical treatment. He also declared to the High Court that he was withdrawing his guarantee and revoked the guarantee letter. Soong Ching-ling had no choice but to withdraw her guarantee as well and left in anger. Therefore, the issue of Noulens' release from prison for medical treatment remains unresolved. The judicial authorities stated that the transfer to a hospital could only be designated to a hospital in Nanjing and that transfer to Shanghai for medical treatment would absolutely not be allowed. Noulens insists on receiving medical treatment in Shanghai and transferring jurisdiction; otherwise, he is unwilling to go to any hospital and remains on hunger strike. Noulens' sight is gradually failing, and he cannot distinguish people. Noulens' condition seemed to have changed drastically on the night of the 12th. Given their current state, if they continue their hunger strike, their lives will definitely be in danger. According to comments from foreigners in Nanjing, release on bail for medical treatment is already a compromise. There is no difference between being in Nanjing and Shanghai, so why insist on going to Shanghai? As for the issue of transferring jurisdiction, there are legal grounds for this and it should not be discussed together with the choice of location for medical treatment. (Special Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu High Court has designated the Central Hospital and Gulou Hospital as locations for Noulens to receive medical treatment, allowing him to choose one of them. It presented this to him in the afternoon, giving him a final period of hesitation. If he continues to reject persuasion, the court will forcibly implement appropriate medical treatment and feeding, etc. Chen Ying, Noulens' defense lawyer, returned to Shanghai in the afternoon because he had given up hope on Noulens' release for medical treatment.

<h3>Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Returns Resignations of Luo and Zheng</p>
<p>Luo and Zheng Have Not Abandoned Intent to Resign</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Luo and Zheng's resignations were sent to the Executive Yuan, they did not go to the Ministry to work starting on the 13th. However, the Executive Yuan has returned the resignations with instructions to persuade them to stay. (Special Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Although Luo Wengan and Zheng Tianxi have been urged to stay, they remain firm in their intention to resign and have returned the Ministry of Justice cars they were using to the Ministry, hiring cars to get around to show their determination (13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, Soong Ching-ling's visit to Nanjing over the Noulens case has attracted much attention from various parties. President Wang (Jingwei) issued a statement to reporters from the Central Daily News regarding this matter, saying that the Noulens case is already in the process of trial and falls entirely within the scope of judicial matters. Everything should be resolved according to the law, so I feel there is no need to express an opinion. Recently, because Noulens is on hunger strike and is on the verge of danger, Madam Sun Soong Ching-ling and Mr. Cai Ziming have made a claim in accordance with the law to guarantee that Noulens can go out for medical treatment. This is both to consider humanitarianism and to act within the scope of the law so that there is no suspicion of infringing on judicial independence. Therefore, Minister Luo of the Ministry of Justice and Deputy Minister Zheng have already promised in this regard, thinking that the location for medical treatment should be limited to Nanjing, so as not to be negligent in prevention. This is also a necessary consideration. As for Minister Luo and Deputy Minister Zheng resigning because they feel it is difficult to handle matters, I don't think it needs to be discussed, because Minister Luo and Deputy Minister Zheng have always abided by the law, and those who are rescuing Noulens have never tried to resolve it outside the law. Even regarding the location of Noulens' medical treatment, Mr. Cai Ziming also recognizes that Minister Luo's opinion is a factual consideration that the judicial administration authorities should have, and he sent a letter last night (12th) to withdraw the guarantee, which shows that all parties' attitudes are extremely cautious. There will be no unexpected twists and turns in the future of this case. Over the years, Mr. Cai has repeatedly pleaded for young people in the country who have been imprisoned for political crimes. If we understand these facts, we can see that Mr. Cai's attitude is not particularly different for Noulens. (Special Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei told a guest this morning that the government has returned the resignation of Minister of Justice Luo Wengan. Noulens (Ruegg) is currently being formally tried by the Chinese court, so the government does not want to interfere with the judiciary. Cai Yuanpei and Soong Ching-ling, in view of Noulens (Ruegg)'s medical condition caused by his hunger strike, are willing to act as guarantors to ensure that he is admitted to a hospital for medical treatment. This move is purely humanitarian and is permitted by law, so Luo Wengan has approved their request. Luo advocated that the hospital be designated by the court, so the matter has been resolved satisfactorily. Luo Wengan and Deputy Minister of Justice Zheng Tianxi have no need to resign, and the central government has refused to consider their resignations, according to a Reuters report on the 13th.</p>

<h3>Japanese Violate Agreement and Forcibly Seize</h3>
<p>East Railway Wharf Warehouses</p>
<p>Intending to Control Transportation Undertakings</p>
<p>(Moscow) A report from Boli (Khabarovsk) states that on the 7th of this month, five Japanese, led by a Japanese advisor, went to the Chinese Eastern Railway wharf in Harbin.  Claiming to be staff members of the Manchurian State Water Transport Team, they demanded the keys to the wharf office and warehouse from the director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Commercial Agency.  After being refused by the Chinese Eastern Railway staff, the Japanese advisor summoned a police team and occupied the wharf.  The Chinese Eastern Railway guards were expelled, and the warehouse seals and locks were torn off.  Prior to this incident, Chinese Eastern Railway Water Transport Team staff were forbidden from loading goods at the wharf, and freighters carrying soybeans from Sanxing (a region in Manchuria) to the Soviet Grain Export Trust were driven away when they approached the wharf.  It is said that behind these actions, several Japanese advisors had been planning for days to obtain the Chinese Eastern Railway wharf in order to sublet it to the South Manchuria Transportation Company, which is operated by Japanese.  This company is the largest Japanese transportation company and is essentially a part of the South Manchuria Railway Company.  It is clear that the Japanese action violates existing agreements, and their purpose is naturally to transfer wharf loading and unloading operations to Japanese-run transportation companies, enabling them to manipulate operations at will, increase the business of the South Manchuria Railway, and directly hinder the commercial interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway.

<h3>Reconnaissance Aircraft Crash</h3>
<p>Two Crew Members Perish in Flames with the Aircraft</p>
<p>(Bengbu) The 1st Squadron of the Bengbu Aviation Corps had been flying from Hefei to Changqiu for several days to reconnoiter and bomb the Red bandits. On the morning of the 13th, they dropped over ten bombs between Hongjiaji and Yulinji, destroying enemy bandit fortifications, and returned to report. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, they flew to Changqiu and Liuan to drop communication bags, and planned to bomb Yulindian again before returning to Hefei. When taking off, there was a strong southwest wind. The aircraft was pulled up too early and encountered a gust of wind from the right wing, causing it to turn left too sharply and crash. It crashed at the eastern barracks south of Bengshan. Four of the six bombs exploded, injuring seventeen soldiers, including Wang Zaichao and Wu Jiaxiu, of the 50th Regiment of the 9th Division. Wang and Wu were seriously injured and sent to the military hospital for treatment, with little hope of survival. The remaining minor injuries are being treated.

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<h3>Japan's Attempt to Annex the Northeast</h3>
<p>Suddenly Changes Course</p>
<p>The Governor-General System Will Not Be Implemented Temporarily</p>
<p>To Avoid Repeating the Errors of Annexing Korea</p>
<p>Reuter's Tokyo, 13th - Political circles here claim that the plan for Japan to unify the administration of Manchuria under a Governor-General or a chief administrator is unlikely to be realized. It is said that the [Manchukuo] government expressed its strong unwillingness because this kind of suggestion greatly resembled the steps taken by Japan before annexing Korea. However, it is expected that the Japanese government will send a general to serve as the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Manchuria. As for the position of president of the South Manchuria Railway, due to intense competition among cabinet members, the government will likely appoint an acting president for the time being to await further developments in Manchuria and decide on the future status of the South Manchuria Railway.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th - It is now confirmed that Foreign Minister Uchida will issue a declaration in the coming days, stating Japan's attitude towards [Manchukuo]. It is also expected that Uchida will send a memorandum to the League of Nations Investigation Team to allow the team to understand Japan's attitude.</p>
<p>Investigation Team Holds Important Meeting</p>
<p>Held at the British Embassy</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 13th - The Investigation Team held an important meeting at the British Embassy in Japan at 10:00 AM today to prepare a report on the Manchurian issue. The group will attend Foreign Minister Uchida's dinner party this evening.</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 13th - The League of Nations Investigation Team is scheduled to visit Foreign Minister Uchida again at 10:00 AM on the 14th to explore Japan's true intentions. The group is scheduled to take the Chichibu Maru from Yokohama to Shanghai on the 5th. The itinerary after arriving in Shanghai has not been determined.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Issue</h3>
<p>Britain and France Reach Agreement</p>
<p>National, Paris, 13th - It is said that Britain and France have reached an agreement on the disarmament issue after a long talk between the British Ambassador and the French Premier on Tuesday. The content has not been released. After the French Premier met with the British Ambassador at that time, he immediately went to see the President to discuss it for a long time. It is said that the French President expressed his full support.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 12th - The public expects that the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference will be able to review the draft resolution on Thursday. Representatives of various countries have been negotiating diligently for a week on this case. Although there have been various pessimistic reports from outside, the negotiation situation can be said to be good. If no unexpected events occur, Simon's disarmament resolution should be discussed publicly in the General Committee on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>National, Washington, 12th - Congressman Denham today proposed a resolution advocating the immediate recall of the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, because the conference has not achieved much result and has failed to accept the disarmament plans proposed by London or Washington.</p>
<h3>British Government Publishes</h3>
<p>Original Text of the Lausanne Convention</p>
<p>The Original Treaty Is Stored with the French Government</p>
<p>Copies Prepared and Distributed to Various Countries</p>
<p>Havas, London, 12th - The British government has recently published the original text of the Lausanne Treaty in a blue book, titled [Protocol of the Lausanne Conference on July 9, 1932]. Prime Minister MacDonald wrote the preface, briefly describing the negotiation process and the technical clauses in the treaty. MacDonald also said that the original treaty was drafted in both English and French and stored in the archives of the French government. Copies were prepared by France, checked against the original, and sent to the countries participating in the Lausanne Conference and the Hague Conference in 1929 (discussing the Young Plan).</p>
<h3>Gentleman's Agreement Does Not Contain Secret Nature</h3>
<p>War Debt Issue Waits Quietly for US Proposal</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 12th - After Prime Minister MacDonald described the situation of the Lausanne Conference in the House of Commons, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said that the [Gentleman's Agreement] was not secret. If the government agrees, he is prepared to publish it. The agreement stipulates that if a complete write-off can be achieved, then we should also write it off. If a complete write-off is impossible, then we must quietly await the US proposal before we can decide on a solution. The so-called [Gentleman's Agreement] is nothing more than a brief record of the discussions agreed upon between creditor countries. If the United States had participated in the discussion, this agreement would not have been necessary, because we could have reached complete agreement on the spot, etc.</p>
<h3>Washington Declares Itself Not Bound by Secret Agreements</h3>
<p>Anti-Revision of War Debt Atmosphere Strong Domestically</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 12th - According to a Washington news dispatch, speculation in Washington that the European powers and US representatives had an explicit understanding before signing the Lausanne Agreement has raised doubts and will make Congress even more opposed to revising European war debt contracts. It is said that Senator Smoot has declared that Europe has crossed the line of good taste, and the door to war debt revision is now closed. Another message said that Borah relayed Secretary of State Stimson's statement in the Senate that the United States is not bound by any gentleman's agreement under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 12th - The New York Times received a message from Washington stating that the trend of congressmen opposing war debt agreements is becoming more intense. Republican Senator Smoot said that the actions of European countries have gone beyond the rails, so that war debts cannot be revised. Europe's attitude is a kind of international insult to the United States, etc.</p>
<h3>International Economic Conference to Be Convened</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Basel, 12th - The Bank for International Settlements notified the League of Nations today that the bank will immediately begin preparing for the international economic conference. Regarding the economic conference, there were preliminary talks at Lausanne. In the future, the bank will occupy an important position in European recovery work. It is said that the entire European post-war plan resulting from the future economic conference may be entrusted to the bank as a non-political custodian.</p>
<h3>Germans Oppose Restoring the Young Plan</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 12th - There are now Germans raising the question of what should happen if one of the countries participating in the Lausanne Conference does not approve the agreement. According to political authorities, MacDonald said at a certain public meeting in Lausanne that if the above situation were to occur, then all issues regarding reparations should be re-discussed. However, the German opinion is that under no circumstances should the Young Plan be restored.</p>
<h3>German Government</h3>
<p>Urgently Seeks Economic Construction</p>
<p>National Attention Now Focused on the Reichstag Re-election Campaign</p>
<p>Various Parties Use the Results of the Lausanne Conference as a Tool for Political Strife</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th - German Chancellor von Papen convened a cabinet meeting today to discuss domestic economic construction matters. The resolutions reached today include the following four points: (1) worker service issues, (2) construction worker housing area issues, (3) road construction issues, and (4) land reclamation incidents. Von Papen is now scheduled to depart for East Prussia tomorrow to visit Hindenburg and report on the proceedings of the Lausanne Conference. He is expected to return to Berlin around Friday. Interior Minister Gayl is also traveling east with von Papen, and Gayl also plans to meet with the President to report on all internal affairs matters. Before deciding to travel with von Papen, Gayl had a long meeting with the leaders of the Social Democratic Party. The Social Democratic Party has detailed reports on the disturbances in various places by the National Socialist Party and demanded that the government re-establish national public order within a short period of time, and especially hoped that the President could re-issue the ban on the harassment of Nazi troops. Therefore, Gayl's meeting with the President is also of great significance.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 12th - The day the Lausanne Conference closed was the day the German election campaign began. National attention, previously focused on the reparations issue, has now shifted to the election issue on July 31, and various political parties are using the results of the Lausanne Conference as campaign material. The modern German expression of external affairs is the real tool for the campaign. Various symbols are used everywhere, and their seriousness is almost equal to that of religion. The party plans and slogans used in the past have lost their value. It is expected that there will be only six parties in the new Reichstag: (1) the National Socialist Party, with the largest number of people; (2) the Social Democratic Party; (3) the Communist Party; (4) the Catholic Center Party; (5) the Bavarian People's Party; and (6) the Hugenberg faction's Nationalist Party. The reason for this is that most voters can only identify clearly defined political boundaries, such as Fascism, Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, and the central religious factions. Other political parties with differences that are difficult to distinguish are unknown to the general public. The most intense competition this time will be between the National Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party. As for what attitude Hitler's party will take towards the current government, it is too early to say at this time. The Social Democratic Party's position has not been very bad since joining the opposition party. The Center is anti-Hitler movement, the position is stable, and the slogan is to restore White Prussia. As for the von Papen cabinet, it is above public opinion. Any political party has not explicitly expressed its views on Mr. von Papen.</p>
<h3>British and Autonomous Territory Representatives</h3>
<p>Depart for Ottawa</p>
<p>To Participate in the Imperial Conference</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - Representatives and secretaries from Britain, India, South Africa and other places traveled to Southampton today to board the RMS Empress of Britain to participate in the Ottawa Imperial Conference in Canada. Luggage piled up at Waterloo Station like a mountain. The British representatives are six members of the cabinet: Lord President of the Council Baldwin, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Secretary of State for War Hailsham, Secretary of State for the Colonies Lister, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Gilmour, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas. All cabinet members went to the station to see them off, but Prime Minister MacDonald did not go due to excessive hard work at the Lausanne Conference and according to the doctor's orders.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th - The agenda of the Ottawa British Imperial Economic Conference has been officially released, including: (1) Trade and tariff policies; (2) Expanding Imperial trade preferences; (3) Special interests granted to foreign countries should be applied to all parts of the Empire; (4) Export subsidies and special tariffs to prevent dumping; (5) Discussing agreed policies and interpreting the [Most Favored Nation] treatment; (6) Methods of cooperation between the various parts of the Empire, including industrial cooperation, standard of malpractices and stabilizing prices and exchange rates.</p>
<h3>Tense Relations Between Russia and Japan</h3>
<p>Fishermen's Dispute Reverses Situation</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 13th - The matter of about 400 Japanese fishermen being imprisoned by Russian police officers in Kamchatka was about to be resolved satisfactorily after the Japanese technician Miyake contacted the Russian official office. Later, due to the change of heart of the Japanese fishermen, the incident suddenly turned for the worse. The 400 Japanese fishermen decided to leave Kamchatka. Technician Miyake again put forward two new conditions: (1) Russia should immediately prepare to send the Japanese fishermen back to their country; (2) Immediately clear the wages and allowances during the fishing and hunting period. Therefore, the incident became tense. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture believes this is an unprecedented major event and convened a meeting of important people from all provinces to discuss countermeasures. On the Russian side, the Russian-Manchurian negotiations have broken down due to the Japanese government's instigation of the puppet state to seize Russia's rights and interests in northern Manchuria. If the two sides persist so firmly, the situation in the Far East is alarming again.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 13th - According to a telegram from the Junjuan Maru, the situation of the dispute over Japanese fishermen in western Kamchatka has since reversed. Although the Soviet Russia has agreed to the general requirements, it claims that it needs to consult the head office on the proportion of compensation for fishing. As a result of the reserved answer, the Japanese fishermen were greatly angered and decided to push back to the mainland immediately. The problem could not be solved unless the agricultural and forestry authorities came forward to negotiate.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Inquires About China</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - During today's House of Commons session, Conservative MP William Wren asked Foreign Secretary Simon whether he intended to send a message to the United States, hoping for British-American cooperation in maintaining the Open Door Policy in Manchuria. Simon replied that he saw no reason to send such a message, as there was no information indicating that British businesses in Manchuria were being discriminated against. Furthermore, the Japanese had guaranteed strict adherence to the Open Door Policy. The MP then asked the Foreign Secretary if he was aware that British merchants trading in Manchuria were complaining that their businesses were experiencing some discrimination. The Foreign Secretary requested that the MP provide details, and stated that he had, of course, communicated with the U.S. government regarding the status of Manchuria. Next, Conservative MP Milne inquired about the Shanghai Round Table Conference. The Foreign Secretary replied that he could not facilitate this conference while Parliament was in recess, but he would not ignore the matter. He added that there were no recent developments in China that warranted special comment. Milne responded that, superficially, it seemed that the Nanjing government was making efforts to establish security in the Yangtze River basin, and asked if the Foreign Secretary was willing to help them. The Foreign Secretary reiterated that the British government would do everything possible to help, and to restore security in the Yangtze River basin or elsewhere in the world. Parliament is scheduled to adjourn today.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Assembly Meeting Postponed</h3>
<p>Special Session to Convene Next Tuesday</p>
<p>Welcoming Turkey's Accession to the League</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 11th - The League of Nations Assembly, originally scheduled to convene on September 5th, has now been postponed to September 18th.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 12th - The League of Nations Assembly will hold a special session on the 19th, at which time Turkey's accession to the League of Nations will be confirmed.

It is reported that Turkey raised some reservations regarding the Covenant, especially regarding Article 16, which stipulates [that member states adhering to the Covenant shall be allowed free passage through the territory of another member state for their troops to jointly uphold the Covenant], requesting a reservation.</p>
<h3>Norway Occupies Greenland Island</h3>
<p>Danish Government Considers it a Violation of Agreements</p>
<p>National News Agency, Oslo, 12th - Despite the dispute between Norway and Denmark over southeastern Greenland being subject to adjudication by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Norwegian government has now implemented an occupation because Denmark is sending a large team of scientists to survey and map the disputed area. According to the Norwegian government's subsequent explanation, the Danish survey team sent to eastern Greenland this year was given police powers. Furthermore, in recent years, Denmark has attempted to prevent whaling ships from landing in Greenland. Another report claims that the Norwegian government took this action because Denmark sent a police force to occupy southeastern Greenland. The area that the Norwegian government has decided to occupy is between 60 degrees 30 minutes and 63 degrees 40 minutes north latitude. Last year, a Norwegian expedition surveyed the area and mapped part of it.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Copenhagen, 13th - The Danish government and people are extremely concerned upon hearing the news of Norway's occupation of parts of Greenland. Prime Minister Stauning declared that the government considers Norway's actions not only as an infringement of Danish rights as in similar actions last year, but also a violation of the 1924 agreement and an infringement on Danish territory, as the area is part of Finland's colony in Greenland. He added that the matter will be handled through foreign affairs to be rectified through proper diplomatic channels.</p>
<h3>Spain</h3>

<h3>Large Anthracite Coal Mine Discovered in Italy</h3>

<p>Irish Government Plans Retaliation</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th - The Special Tax on Free State Goods Act will now be implemented, allowing the British government to recover the £3 million per year owed by the Free State in land annuities. The Treasury Department issued an order tonight stating that, starting July 14th, the following goods imported into Britain from the Free State will be subject to a 20% ad valorem tax: livestock, butter, eggs, beef, pork, poultry, game, and various meats.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 13th - All of Ireland was astonished to hear that the British government had decided to impose a special tax on Irish imports, as the initial understanding was that this would not happen before the arbitration issue was resolved. It is feared that arbitration may be difficult to achieve. Free State cabinet members held a secret meeting last night, where there was talk of imposing retaliatory tariffs. Former Free State President Cosgrave told a Reuters reporter today that the poor farmers would rely on divine help. A Free State MP claimed today that if someone had 3,000 head of cattle for export, they would lose £12,000 in British gold under the new tax regulations.</p>
<h3>Belgian Strike Wave Difficult to Resolve</h3>
<p>Workers Put Forward Three Demands</p>
<p>Reuters, Brussels, 12th - A general strike has broken out in the Liège region due to a labor dispute in the coal industry. Police are making every effort to maintain order, and there has been no unrest so far. Disputes have also occurred in the Charleroi area, with approximately 2,000 people arrested. Other areas are peaceful, but a resolution to the strike seems unlikely at present.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Brussels, 12th - The General Committee of the Belgian Socialist Party and the Executive Committee of the National Trade Union, unexpectedly vetoed a motion to declare a general strike, instructing workers in areas not affected by the labor unrest to continue working as before. However, they expressed full support for all the demands made by the striking workers, requesting the Belgian government to comply. The main points raised by the workers are: (1) Abandon the proposal to increase wheat prices, (2) Immediately stop wage cuts, (3) Ensure that those who wish to work have the opportunity to do so.</p>
<h3>Shoe King</h3>
<p>Died After Not Entering Sleeping Cabin</p>
<p>Known as the "Ford" of Europe During His Lifetime</p>
<p>National News Agency, Prague, 12th - Regarding the circumstances of the death of Czech millionaire shoe king Bata, we have now received a detailed telegram stating that before Bata's private plane took off, the pilot refused to depart due to the heavy fog. However, Bata insisted on going, so the pilot took off and ascended. After ascending into the sky, they saw that the surroundings were filled with fog and there was no way to proceed. Therefore, they descended, but during the descent, they touched the wires of a high-voltage power line, causing the accident. Bata's plane had a sleeping cabin, but after boarding the plane, Bata lost his usual behavior and did not enter the sleeping cabin, but sat with the pilot. Otherwise, Bata would not have died, as Bata's sleeping cabin was completely undamaged.</p>
<p>Havas, Czech Capital, 12th - Bata was highly respected by people here during his lifetime. Upon hearing of his death, people near and far mourned him. Bata was the son of a Moravian shoemaker. He inherited his father's trade and, relying on his efforts, was able to expand his father's business. In 1930, he managed 32 shoe factories and employed 16,000 workers, so he was sometimes referred to as the "Ford" of Europe.</p>

<h3>Northeastern Traitors</h3>
<p>Eagerly Seeking to Expand Military Strength</p>
<p>Recruiting New Soldiers from Villages</p>
<p>Purchasing Guns from Civilians</p>
<p>Japanese Forcibly Implementing Education Plans</p>
<p>Yu Zhishan's Troops Serving as Accomplices</p>
<p>North China Correspondence: A person from the Northeast discussed the recent situation in the Northeast as follows: (1) Northeastern rebels, such as Zhang Haipeng's troops, have recently been actively recruiting new soldiers from villages. However, apart from a few unemployed vagrants who have responded to the call, the rest of the villagers are unwilling to join. The rebels are also carrying a large number of propaganda materials to promote among the villagers, spreading fallacies such as, [At the beginning of the establishment of Manchuria, the national defense is not yet consolidated. We hope that patriotic people will quickly enlist to protect the national defense.] (2) The Japanese have recently been actively investigating the number of households and fixed assets in each village, and plan to purchase all civilian guns in order to form a military. This order to collect guns was issued to the village chiefs of each village a few days ago, setting a deadline for payment: 30 yuan for large guns and 40 yuan for small guns. They are also instructing each village to build walls and repair fences in order to defend against bandits. (3) The Japanese army is extremely tyrannical in each village. If farmers slightly violate their established rules, they will be shot. Recently, when trains on the Datong Road arrive at Badaohao, the Japanese army swarms up and searches passengers extensively, taking the opportunity to steal passengers' belongings. The Japanese soldiers stationed in Xinlitun are demolishing all the houses near them because the weather is getting hotter, in order to allow air to circulate. (4) The Japanese supervisors of the Puppet Education Department have recently been frequently convening meetings of the principals and teachers of various schools, forcibly ordering them to implement the Japanese education plan, and ordering students of various schools to organize youth league groups affiliated to the Concordia Association (the Concordia Association is a group of Japanese invaders in the Northeast). All the work of the group is under the control of the Concordia Association. Its purpose is to promote the recognition of the puppet Manchuria and often sends people to give lectures in various counties and villages to deceive the people. (5) The Shenyang Japanese Gendarmerie recently summoned Wei, the head of the Puppet Education Department, accusing him of not working hard to build Japanese language schools, and ordered him to establish Japanese language schools in all counties in the shortest possible time in accordance with the order. (6) Yu Zhishan's rebellious troops recently occupied civilian farmland outside the West Gate of Beishancheng Town to build an airfield, with an area of more than 1,000 mu. The Japanese Kwantung Leased Territory requested 20 aircraft to be allocated to them, and they fly to various places every day to scout out the activities of the National Salvation Army. On the 4th of this month, more than 2,000 troops of the brigade, along with 300 Japanese artillery soldiers and six Japanese aircraft, advanced towards Chaoyang Town and engaged in a fierce battle with the 2,000 troops of the National Salvation Army led by Li Qiankun in the area. The Japanese aircraft dropped incendiary bombs, and the entire town was engulfed in flames, destroying countless houses. In order to preserve their strength, the National Salvation Army completely withdrew to nearby areas to wait for an opportunity to counterattack.</p>
<p>Another report: A person from Qingyuan said that Guan Xiangyang's National Salvation Army, with more than 10,000 soldiers, and Li Jingyang, the commander-in-chief of the White Flag Society, led more than 1,000 members of the White Flag Society and clashed with more than 2,000 of Yu Zhishan's troops led by Sun, the puppet chief of staff, in Nanshancheng Town on the 6th of this month. After a day of fierce fighting, Yu's troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated into the city. The National Salvation Army attacked from all sides and heavily besieged the city. Yu Zhishan is currently in Beishancheng Town. Because the National Salvation Army is powerful, he sent an urgent telegram to the Japanese Kwantung Leased Territory. On the 7th, the Japanese sent five aircraft to assist, flying to various places from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day to scout and bomb. However, the National Salvation Army is determined to fight and relies on strategic locations to fight without retreating. As of the 8th, Yu's troops in Nanshancheng Town had not yet escaped danger.

<h3>Korean Patriotic Corps</h3>
<p>Plotting to Bomb Important Japanese Figures</p>
<p>Still Dispatched by Kim Koo</p>
<p>Targeting Honjo et al.</p>
<p>Four People, Including Liu and Cui, Arrested</p>
<p>Bombs Also Shaped Like Water Bottles</p>
<p>Seoul Correspondence: According to the Kyung Sung Nippo newspaper of the 3rd of this month, Korean Patriotic Corps members Liu Sang-geun, Choi Heung-shik, Lee Seong-won, and Lee Seong-bal planned to assassinate Kantogun Commander Honjo Shigeru and South Manchurian Railway President and newly appointed Foreign Minister Uchida Kosai when the League of Nations Investigative Delegation arrived at Dalian Station from Shenyang and Japanese military and government officials personally greeted them. The local police station discovered the plan and arrested Liu and the other four, but kept it secret. It was not until the beginning of this month that the newspapers were allowed to report it. Here is a translation of the general outline:</p>
<p>Since the Manchurian Incident occurred and Japan implemented its invasion of the three northeastern provinces of China, the Korean Independence Party believed that the spark for the Second World War had been ignited and was actively planning a restoration movement on a large scale with careful planning. The Korean Patriotic Corps, led by Kim Koo, was solely responsible for assassination. Before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the organization had already dispatched violent elements to various places one after another, seeking opportunities to act. The Japanese authorities learned of this information early on, so they secretly deployed security lines in various places in Japan and Korea. The corps disregarded the sacrifices and on January 8th of this year, member Lee Bong-chang threw a bomb at the Japanese Emperor in Tokyo. On April 29th, they sent Yoon Bong-gil to throw special bombs at military and government officials at the Shanghai Japanese celebration of Tencho-setsu at Hongkou Park, and all eight people, including Shirakawa and Shigemitsu, were not spared. Afterwards, military police in various parts of Japan increased their vigilance, almost to the point of sleeplessness and sleeplessness, and they suspected that the corps was roaring, and even the movement of grass and trees was regarded as the corps' activities, making it impossible to defend against. On April 29th, the Dalian Post Office discovered a Korean throwing a letter with a Chinese-style secret telegram number. It was immediately sent to the police station in the port for inspection. It was only then that it was learned that there were several assassins lurking in the port, preparing to take action. Therefore, the entire city was searched. At dawn on May 24th, Choi Heung-shik was arrested at the home of Kim Jeong-soon, a Korean fisherman at No. 5, Beitashan Tong, in the Korean Fishermen's Association. The next day, Liu Sang-geun, Lee Won-seong, and Lee Won-bal were arrested one after another. After severe torture, the truth became clear. It is said that the four were all Koreans and were ordered by Kim Koo, the leader of the Patriot Corps. Choi Heung-shik (22 years old) was quick-witted and good at planning, and was solely responsible for investigating the security situation in Lushun and Dalian. On April 1st, he sneaked into Dalian by sea and hid in the home of Kim Jeong-soon in the Korean dormitory of the South Manchurian Railway, Kodama Ryo. During this period, he secretly went to Fengtian, Changchun, and Harbin to find opportunities. Liu Sang-geun (age 𠃒)</p>
<p>Assassination mission. On May 4th, he came to Dalian from a certain place and hid in the bedroom of a Korean employee of the South Manchurian Railway in the Kodama Ryo dormitory in Koyamacho. Lee Yong-bal, the eldest son of a 72-year-old man, Lee Seong-won and Seong-bal, were responsible for transporting weapons. Bombs and pistols were transported from a certain place by boat to Yingkou and then transferred to Dalian and delivered to Liu Sang-geun for storage. Liu received the weapons and hid them in his own suitcase. The four secretly communicated and made arrangements. They learned that the League of Nations Investigative Delegation would arrive at Dalian Station at 7:40 p.m. on May 26th. Honjo Shigeru and Uchida Kosai, who came here in advance to wait, would personally greet them at the time. They attempted to take the opportunity to bomb and annihilate the two in one fell swoop. If the opportunity was missed, they would change the date to 3:30 a.m. on the 30th when the investigation delegation left Dalian. After the purpose was achieved, they would commit suicide with the prepared pistols and would never allow the Japanese to capture them. After Liu Sang-geun was arrested, his attitude was calm. Choi Heung-shik said that he did not care about the failure this time, because his comrades were spread all over the place, dedicated to killing the Japanese giants who had ambitions. They would continue to advance and never stop the implementation of this plan. According to the confession, their purpose this time was to give a severe punishment to those who destroyed the peace of the East in front of the eyes of the investigation delegation and to make the international community understand that the Korean people's resistance to the strong Japanese was on the same front as China, and not like the Japanese unilateral deceptive propaganda, blindly obscuring the world's vision. It is said that the bomb copied by the police station is of the same type as the bomb used by Bai Chuan et al. in Hongkou Park. It is a large military water bottle weighing 130 taels containing strong explosives and thin white iron, wrapped in a 3-fen thick steel skin, lined with yellow flannel, and tied with a long belt. When throwing it, remove the small cap and pull out the tip. This tip can generate friction and ignite naturally. Moreover, because the water bottle-shaped bomb is tied with a long belt, it can use centrifugal force to adjust the distance according to the distance of the purpose, which is extremely accurate.

<h3>Ministry of Navy</h3>
<p>Requests Investigation of Gao You-tang</p>
<p>Claims Gao Damaged Military Reputation and Violated Regulations</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Member Gao You-tang recently made remarks to news reporters in Jinan, which involved the navy. The Ministry of Navy now believes that Gao has violated the provisions of Article 10 of the Impeachment Law, intentionally damaging the military's reputation, confusing the regulations of the council, and violating regulations. It has submitted a document to the government yesterday requesting an investigation. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>[Submitting a request for the investigation of Supervisory Yuan member Gao You-tang, who has damaged the military's reputation, shaken the people's hearts, confused the council's regulations, and violated regulations. I respectfully request your approval. I have read in the Shanghai Shen Bao on the 9th of this month that Supervisory Yuan member Gao You-tang made remarks in Jinan. One of them stated that the impeachment case against the Ministry of Navy will also be submitted to the Central Government. Because of the Shanghai War, the 19th Route Army advanced bravely, while the navy stood by idly and signed a treaty with Japanese Admiral Shiiozawa,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Agreeing that shells would not land on naval ships and that no shots would be fired. The 19th Route Army asked to borrow anti-aircraft guns but was refused, and even a single iron plate was not lent. It is too unbearable. The corruption on weekdays is unspeakable. The Marine Corps is not on the ships but is planting opium in Fujian, relying on its power to oppress the people. Director Yu often said, why bother to use the blood, sweat, and money of the people of the country to maintain the rice bowls of the people of Fujian? Because the current navy has become the world of the hereditary Fujian people. We advocate that the navy be completely abolished and that the ships be sold to merchants as merchant ships, because the navy's annual fee is more than one million, which is equivalent to having no navy. Why not free up this amount and add the proceeds from the sale of the ships to purchase 200 submarines? It should be known that the Chinese navy does not hope to attack people, but it is much better to defend the sea with 200 small boats than with useless warships. In addition, the Capital New Kyoto Daily also published the member's remarks, stating that the impeachment case against Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan was again being considered. The navy's monthly expenses require one million yuan, which is not insignificant. However, it cannot defend the country and resist foreign aggression, and coastal merchant ships are often robbed. The navy has not heard of any plans to suppress them, which is extremely shameful. The Marine Corps is forcibly planting chestnuts in Fujian, sucking the marrow of the people. What is the use of such troops? Therefore, it is suggested that the Central Government abolish the navy and use this huge sum of one million yuan per month to purchase 200 submarines. After all, it is better to use submarines to maintain the coastal defense than to be unable to fight and resist the enemy. I have investigated that Gao You-tang's impeachment of the navy has been reported in the newspapers more than once. The Ministry did not want to engage in meaningless debate and tolerated it again and again. However, the member has become more and more arrogant, even making speeches everywhere slandering the central government agencies to show off his ability to impeach and serve as a source of conversation. The remarks he made were all deliberately provocative and insulting to the government. Now, I will correct the slanderous remarks about the navy: One, the navy stood by idly during the Shanghai War, and anti-aircraft guns and steel plates were not lent. Since China and Japan have not formally declared war, how dare the navy act without government orders? As for the navy's purchase of military equipment and ammunition, reports have been filed. Whether there are anti-aircraft guns and steel plates that can be allocated and borrowed is already under the government's assessment. Even if there are, they must not be privately given or received. Two, a treaty was signed with Japanese Admiral Shiiozawa, agreeing that shells would not land on naval ships and that no shots would be fired. International treaties must be approved by the government and cannot be signed privately by any agency. Anyone with a little common sense can understand this. The so-called treaty between our army and Shiiozawa is said to be based on what? Three, the navy is corrupt on weekdays, and it is unspeakable. Our army has been working hard for years, day and night, and has been striving for various important government affairs and dare not slack off. All work has reports that can be verified. The member regards it as corruption and should be ordered to point out conclusive evidence. Four, the Marine Corps is not on the ships, but is planting opium in Fujian. The Marine Corps of all countries are not stationed on ships during peacetime. The member is ignorant of the navy's situation and the world situation, so he has this bizarre statement. Moreover, the Marine Corps stationed in Fujian has a good relationship with the local people, and the ban on smoking in the area where it is stationed has been repeatedly emphasized. The member fabricated slander without any evidence. The military's reputation is at stake, and all the soldiers are deeply indignant. Five, the useless navy should be completely abolished and the ships sold to merchants. The proceeds from the sale of the ships and the navy's expenses should be used to purchase 200 submarines to defend the sea. The configuration of warships and merchant ships is different, and it is difficult to apply the conversion of warships into merchant ships. As for the purchase cost of submarines, the small ones cost several million yuan per ship. If calculated at 200 ships, the cost is huge. Even if the cost of selling the warships and the navy's expenses are all allocated, how many ships can be purchased? The member has no naval common sense, and his plan is contrary to the facts. Moreover, the establishment of the navy by the country is not only responsible for defending the country during the war, but also for pacifying the rivers and seas and defending the local area in peacetime, which is an urgent task. In addition to submarines, should other ships be used to share the responsibility of patrolling and defending? Those who know the truth will be able to distinguish. The ships of our army have been working diligently to suppress bandits. As soon as they hear of bandit alarms, they rush to aid day and night. The details of what happened have been reported in detail and can be reviewed. The member said that he watched the pirates rampantly and had not heard of the navy having a plan to eliminate them. His reversal of black and white and arbitrary barking is even more hateful. The above items are based on the facts. Looking at the point of law again, according to Article 10 of the revised Impeachment Law promulgated by the National Government on June 25th of this year, Supervisory Yuan personnel shall not disclose any impeachment case to the outside world before it is transferred to the disciplinary agency, in order to protect the dignity of the council system and prevent the malpractices of lobbying. The member is responsible for the important task of supervision and should strictly abide by it, but he does not know how to check himself and has preemptively disclosed important cases, not only destroying the reputation of our army, but also violating the order and disregarding the regulations of the council. He is like this in one case, and it can be seen in other cases. Moreover, the member also said that Director Yu often said, why bother to use the blood, sweat, and money of the people of the country to maintain the rice bowls of the people of Fujian? Because the current navy has become the world of the hereditary Fujian people. According to the Nanjing Evening News of the 10th of this month, Director Yu said in Shanghai that the newspaper reported that Supervisory Committee member Gao You-tang made remarks in Jinan. According to Yu Youren, Gao said that the heads of various departments and ministries, 19 of them, have been impeached, which is not the case. What he said was that every time I went to the Central Government to attend a meeting, I looked around and saw that most of the people who had been impeached were glaring at me. It is baseless and does not need to be defended. As for the affairs of the Ministry of Navy, what is said is that why bother to use the blood, sweat, and money of the people of the country to maintain the rice bowls of the people of Fujian? It is the original text of a certain supervisory committee member impeaching the Minister of Navy. I thought at the time that the affairs of the Navy Department should not offend the people of Fujian Province. Therefore, I once told the original impeacher that the impeachment case should be based on facts and should not be a vague criticism. Now, the remarks are pointed to as my words, which is even more contrary to the facts. The other sections are mostly related to Gao Jun's personal feelings, and I naturally cannot answer on his behalf. It can be seen that the member's remarks are completely fabricated. With such important remarks, he has planted blame on the head of our agency. In addition to slandering our army, there are various arguments for insulting the government and alienating feelings. His intentions are even more unpredictable. Reputation is the second life of a soldier. If he is slandered for no reason, it is not appropriate to remain silent. In order to respect the authority of the government and maintain the regulatory rules of supervision, it is difficult to allow the member to privately confuse the situation. It is appropriate to present this to your hospital and ask you to forward it to the appropriate authorities for investigation and handling in accordance with the law, in order to uphold the order and maintain the military's reputation. I am extremely sincere and awaiting orders.]</p>
<h3>E Province Government Convenes</h3>
<p>Political Reorganization Conference</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Summons County Magistrates to Urge Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Members of Post-War Rehabilitation Committees in Various Counties Have Been Selected</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Commander-in-Chief Chiang previously ordered the E Province Government to convene county magistrates to the provincial capital for a meeting, and scheduled a personal interview. A total of forty-five county magistrates came to the province upon summons. At 9:00 AM on the 12th, they were led by Provincial Chairman Xia Douyin, Civil Affairs Director Zhu Huai Bing (Bi Hui Kang acting), Finance Director Shen Zhao Nian, Education Director Shen Shi Yuan, Construction Director Li Shu Cheng, Committee Members Kong Geng, Yan Xunfu, Cheng Ru Huai, Secretary-General Yang Zaichun, etc., to the headquarters to meet Chiang. Chiang first summoned the magistrates of Yidu, Badong, and Mianyang counties, individually inquiring about local conditions. He then summoned the entire group for a speech, generally stating that banditry in E Province was rampant for many reasons, but the biggest problem was past inaction and perfunctoriness. The county is a unit of self-governance, and the magistrate is an official close to the people. It is a disgrace for a magistrate to sit by and watch the people be ravaged by bandits. From now on, each magistrate should redouble their efforts, be willing to sacrifice, and be responsible. They should organize the masses, use local self-defense forces, and cooperate with local fair-minded people to thoroughly eliminate banditry. Regarding counties with bandits, they must have a clear investigation and reorganization plan regarding the bandit situation, how to proceed with suppression, as well as local security conditions, and transportation construction status, etc. He also said that if military officers stationed in various places, from division commanders down, bully county magistrates, they are permitted to telegraph the headquarters for handling. After the speech, he personally instructed Xia Douyin to hold a local political reorganization conference in the provincial capital within three days, for a period of three days. The attendees were stipulated to be nine party and government committee members from the headquarters, ten provincial chairman, directors, committee members, and secretary-general, six secretaries and section chiefs from the civil, finance, and construction departments, four secretaries and section chiefs from the provincial secretariat, and forty-five county magistrates. Those who have not reported will join at any time. After receiving the order, Xia immediately sent out notifications on the evening of the 12th, scheduling the start of the meeting at 8:00 AM on the 13th, to be completed on the 15th. The conference will formulate detailed plans and reports on methods of bandit suppression, disaster relief, security, and construction in various counties, to be submitted to the headquarters for selection and implementation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the provincial government received an order from Chiang to promptly select and recommend personnel for post-war rehabilitation in bandit areas and local gentry assisting in the suppression. Each county must guarantee the selection of two people, a head and a deputy. Every three or four counties will be designated as a post-war rehabilitation district, and two people will be guaranteed selection in each, with special privileges and respect, so that they can work hard for their hometowns and be responsible for assisting in the suppression. The civil affairs department was immediately ordered to compile a list and submit it to the headquarters for review on the 12th. It is planned that in the eastern E area, Qishui, Qichun, Luotian, and Guangji will be one district, with Committee Chairman Li Shiqiao and Committee Member Wen Juntian. Macheng, Huang'an, Huangpi, and Xiaogan will be one district, with Committee Chairman Cheng Ru Huai and Committee Member Yu Yu Zhi. In the central E area, Mianyang, Qianjiang, Jianli, and Hanyang will be one district, with Committee Chairman Nan Xian and Committee Member Ai Yu Ying. Hekou, Tianmen, Yingcheng, and Jingshan will be one district, with Committee Chairman Yan Xunfu and Committee Members Lu De Ze and Zuo Duo. In the southern E area, Yangxin, Daye, Echeng, Xianning, Tongshan, Chongyang, and Tongcheng will be one district, with Committee Chairman Yu Zi Xiang and Committee Member Wang Shi Liu. The county committee members are: Qishui Committee Member Li Shiqiao, Deputy Committee Member Guo Zhao, Qichun Committee Member Ling Shao Mei, Luotian Committee Member Liu Hong Yu, Deputy Committee Member Fang Guo Qing, Macheng Committee Member Zheng Mei Xuan, Deputy Committee Member Zheng Jie Qiao, Huang'an Committee Member Shi Yu Ling, Deputy Committee Member Chen Tie Hou, Huangpi Committee Member Li Xuan Xuan, Xiaogan Committee Member Jiang Shao Yuan, Deputy Committee Member Wang Bao He, Yangxin Committee Member Chen Zhi Ping, Daye Committee Member Liu Min Ru, Deputy Committee Member Tian Wei Zhong, Echeng Committee Member Hu Shun Sun, Deputy Committee Member Xia Lin Shu, Xianning Committee Member Yuan Qi Qing, Tongshan Committee Member Ruan Zheng Qing, Deputy Committee Member Xia Wen Ying, Chongyang Committee Member Rao Shu Fan, Deputy Committee Member Yu Tian, Tongcheng Committee Member Ge Song Chu, Deputy Committee Member Xia Feng Shi, Mianyang Committee Member Liu Shou Xin, Deputy Committee Member Yan Shuo, Qianjiang Committee Member Zhu Xin Fo, Deputy Committee Member Yuan Xuan Cheng, Jianli Committee Member Chuan Xiang Rong, Hanchuan Committee Member Chen Zong Kai, Deputy Committee Member Wang Zhen Nan, Tianmen Committee Member Hu Zi Ming, Deputy Committee Member Zeng Mao Tang, Yingcheng Committee Member Jiang Zuo Lin, Deputy Committee Member Zuo Duo, Jingshan Committee Member Liu Pei Qing, Deputy Committee Member Yin Shi Dao, Hanyang Committee Member Yan Jing, Deputy Committee Member Zhang Han Qing, Guangji Committee Member Zhou Wu Yi, Deputy Committee Member Gao Zhao Huang.

<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Changes in Educational Administration Personnel: Since the change of leadership in the county education bureau, the internal affairs have been greatly reorganized. It has recently been learned that the bureau received an order from the education department to dismiss supervisor Zhang Zhao Yun and replace him with Zhang Xing Xin. Committee members Shen Ru and Yan Zhen Bang have been dismissed, and replacements have not yet been announced. Previously, the elementary schools in the fourth district jointly presented a petition to retain the district education committee member. After being reprimanded by the bureau, the committee member, Xu Zong Yao, voluntarily resigned. The bureau approved the resignation and appointed Yin Xi Xiong as his replacement, who has reportedly gone to take over his duties.</p>
<p>The Aftermath of Cheng Jun's Being Torn: Cheng Jun, the former head of the public security bureau, was residing in Fengjing. When the Japanese invaders were rampant in the Shanghai area and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Qiantang Railway was in a tense situation, Cheng immediately led his relatives, Ye Yisun, his wife and daughters, and hired a boat to seek refuge in Dongzha. On the way, they encountered a bandit boat that ordered them to stop and boarded the boat to rob them. Cheng was Ye's brother-in-law, and the two daughters were his nieces. The family was wealthy, and if they were kidnapped, it would be extremely dangerous. Therefore, he was mindful of his familial relations and stepped forward, instructing the bandits to release everyone else and leave him alone, so that they could raise money for his ransom. The bandits complied. Cheng Jun was thus kidnapped by the bandits. When Ye returned home, he kept it a secret. Even when Cheng's family inquired, he did not admit that they had been attacked by bandits and kidnapped. It was only after time had passed and Cheng had been killed that they learned the details. Cheng's family, in great pain, suspected Ye of colluding with the bandits and reported him to the Water Bandit Suppression Command, which detained Ye for interrogation. The case was deemed a matter of justice and transferred to Songjiang, where it is currently being investigated by the county court's prosecutor's office. He was interrogated again yesterday, and his testimony remained the same as before. It is unknown how this case will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Four Major Bandits Transferred to Bandit Suppression Headquarters for Interrogation: The first district of the Water Public Security Bureau captured four Lake bandits in Shanghai: Zhang the Blind, Gao Ben Gen, Yun Zhou, and Zeng Pin Rong. Yesterday, they were transferred to the Suzhou-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Headquarters for interrogation. Bandit leader Zhang the Blind confessed to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters that he was from Anhui, his original name was Zhang Pu Yuan, and he served as a policeman in Zhejiang in the seventh year of the Republic [1918]. On February 17th of this year [1937], he colluded with Kong Xiang Hao, Wang Tu Zi, Ruan Li Yun, Xiao Ai, etc., and started a gang in Caojing, using the guise of selling salt to secretly rob. On March 3rd, in Shangmingdian, they kidnapped a Linghu man named Zhang. Later, they joined a gang to rob the Suzhou-bound passenger ship. Wang Yu Shan, a military officer from the 19th Army Transportation Department, was shot and killed by Gu Xing Wen. Later, they encountered police fire at Dianshan Lake. The next day, they encountered police fire twice more in Zhou Zhuang, resulting in many casualties on their side. He jumped into the water and escaped, and was sent to Shanghai from Fengjing. Their guns were all taken away by Qin Xiu Zi. On June 19th, a monk named Zhou invited him to go to Shan to commit a crime, arranging to meet on June 30th. Unexpectedly, he was arrested that morning. He continued to interrogate the other three bandits, then ordered them to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Soldiers Make a Ruckus at the Theater: The Suzhou Grand Theater in the northern district of Suzhou was showing a film at 9:00 PM on the 12th when suddenly more than ten water police guerrilla soldiers, each holding iron rulers and bayonets, stormed in through the front door and rushed into the accounting room. They cut the telephone lines, smashed more than twenty pieces of glass from the large glass windows, and destroyed advertising lights, etc., and then roared away. It is reported that the losses amounted to over a thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Local Silk Factories Still Able to Sell Well: The silk factories in this county have been successively shutting down due to the dire silk market and sluggish foreign sales, resulting in huge losses and even bankruptcy. Now, a few factories are continuing to operate to maintain the livelihood of their workers. Fortunately, domestic silk sales have been brisk recently. In May of this year, Suzhou silk factories purchased twenty pieces of You Yong brand silk from the Taifeng silk factory in this county, valued at 585 taels; five pieces of Que Que brand, valued at 550 taels; five pieces of Tiao Wu brand and ten pieces of Song Bai brand from the Qian Shen silk factory, valued at 550 taels; ten pieces of Er Quan brand, valued at 530 taels; ten pieces of Di Qiu brand from Yongtai, valued at 52 taels; and ten pieces of Di Qiu brand, valued at 500 taels. The Huafeng silk factory in Huzhou also purchased ten pieces of Song Bai brand from Ding Chang, valued at 550 taels, and ten pieces of Huang Pai brand from Yuan Kang, valued at 490 taels. In July, the Suzhou silk factory purchased five pieces from Yufeng, valued at 530 taels; five pieces from Yuji, valued at 580 taels; and five pieces of Jin Ma brand from Ji Ji, valued at 470 taels. In the months of May, June and July, a total of 120 pieces of factory silk were sold, with Huzhou being the strongest market, purchasing 60 pieces in June, followed by Suzhou.</p>

<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs in the Eighth District: Xie Bing Rong's home in Dongxin Township, the eighth district of Wu County, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits a few days ago, who wantonly searched and looted. Not satisfied, they also kidnapped Xie's sixteen-year-old son, Yuan Kang, and left a note demanding a ransom of 35,000 yuan, instructing them to contact them in Nanjing within seven days. Afterwards, the chief of the eighth sub-bureau of public security in charge of the area reported the case to the county on the 12th, requesting an arrest.</p>

<p>Hurricane Causes Disaster in Mapengwan: Mapengwan Town, located thirty li north of Youcheng on the canal levee, is an important transportation hub between north and south. Although the town is small in area, commerce is fairly developed. The town has a population of 112 families, less than a thousand people, mostly engaged in business and quite wealthy. Unexpectedly, at about 8:00 PM on the 9th of this month, there was a sudden storm of wind and rain, with particularly violent winds, lasting for more than ten minutes before stopping. In an instant, an unprecedented disaster occurred. At the southern end of the town, there is Taiping Lane. When the hurricane first started, it began in the middle of the lane and continued to the rice mill at the northern end of the town. All the shops and houses were destroyed, leaving only six buildings, including the rice mill at the north end of the town. Countless trees in the town were destroyed, and two utility poles were also snapped. Most tragically, at the Zhao Da Fang Inn in the town, there were two male and female travelers dressed as students who were staying at the inn that night. They were both killed in the disaster. The heads and abdomens of the man and woman were crushed by bricks and tiles, a bloody mess. Also, a tugboat docked in the town's canal, with seven or eight canal workers sleeping in the cabin, was swept into the air by the hurricane. When the wind stopped, it overturned in the river, drowning five people, one of whom had his abdomen ruptured and his intestines spilling out, a tragic sight. The others were all seriously injured. Three or four small boats in the canal were also overturned by the hurricane, drowning Wang and Wanfu Gui. The others were rescued. There were many civilian casualties in the town, but no accurate count is yet available. It is reported that the losses are estimated at 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The essence of the town has been destroyed, truly an unprecedented catastrophe. It is also reported that in Maojiazhuang near the town, more than ten houses were destroyed by the wind that night, but fortunately no one was injured.</p>

<p>Bandit Kidnapping Organization Cracked in Yu Xian District: On the afternoon of the 11th, members of the Yu Xian Town Sixth District Basic Team detained a suspect named Zhou Chang Ming in front of the Tian Sheng Chang cigarette shop in the western market of the town. He was taken to the team headquarters and interrogated by the Sixth District Chief and Team Leader, who revealed that Chen Ren Guan, who lived in the Da Cao Wang Temple area about three li from the town, had recently sent a letter to Huang Ting Rui, the town chief of You Guang Da Qiao Town, threatening him and demanding a loan of 3,000 yuan, using the alias Yi Shi Bin, and instructing him to reply within three days and have the letter delivered to the Tian Sheng Chang cigarette shop in Yu Xian Town. Zhou was arrested while Chen Ren Guan ordered him to pick up the letter at the shop. The team members then went to Da Cao Wang Temple to arrest Chen, but Chen had fled. Only the landlord, Li Sheng Shi, was apprehended. Chen Ren Guan's biological father, Chen Liang Bing, and his wife, Wu Shi, were arrested in the Tangxi area on the afternoon of the 11th. Wu A Biao, the father of Chen's wife Wu, was apprehended in Da Qiao Town (Wu is a major suspect).

<h3>The British Boxer Indemnity and Cultural Undertakings</h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Secretary-General Hang of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board Announces the Situation, Guowenshe: Recently, financial difficulties in the educational sector have left them with no solutions. They all hope that the management of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board will provide assistance, but the Board has no way to provide relief, which it fears will not be understood. Therefore, Secretary-General Hang Liwu announced his personal situation as follows: After the United States took the lead in returning a portion of the Boxer Indemnity to establish Tsinghua University, all countries have taken returning the Boxer Indemnity to carry out education and cultural undertakings as their aim. In the winter of the eleventh year of the Republic [1922], the British government declared that "[the outstanding Boxer Indemnity payable by China will be returned to China for use in educational and cultural undertakings beneficial to both countries]." Later, due to the general election in the British Parliament and successive changes in the cabinet, it was shelved. It was not until June of the fourteenth year of the Republic [1925] that the British Parliament officially passed [the Chinese Indemnity Bill], which was confirmed as necessary to study the use in advance. A consultative committee was established, consisting of eleven members, eight British and three Chinese (Mr. Hu Shi, Mr. Ding Wenjiang, and Mr. Wang Jingchun). In the fifteenth year of the Republic [1926], the committee organized a delegation to China to investigate and solicit opinions on the use of the returned indemnity. In the same year, the delegation prepared a report. Afterwards, China and Britain exchanged notes, which became the basis. Therefore, on September 19th of the nineteenth year of the Republic [1930], the first exchange of notes on the Sino-British Indemnity was resolved. In the first paragraph of Minister Wang's note to British Minister Lampson, it states, "[The Minister deeply hopes that your government will hand over to the Chinese government for management the full amount of the indemnity payable from December 1, 1922. After the actual handover of this money, the Chinese government intends to refer to the general intent of the report of the Sino-British Advisory Committee of 1926 for the handling of the money. The general intent of the report should be noted by the following board of directors. However, the Chinese government believes that the most beneficial plan for establishing a foundation in the first step is to reorganize and build Chinese railways and invest in other Chinese productive enterprises with most of the indemnity, namely, the current stored funds and future payable funds]." Furthermore, in the final paragraph of the same document, "[For the loans paid by the railways or other productive enterprises, interest should be paid and ultimately guaranteed. All funds for repaying the principal and interest of the loans should be handed over to the board of directors, which will immediately use them for educational undertakings]." Subsequently, the second plenary meeting of the Central Committee in May of the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], and the 226th meeting in May of the nineteenth year of the Republic [1930] and the 262nd political meeting on February 25th of the following year [1931], resolved that the methods for allocating the indemnity and the principles for guaranteeing interest should all be in accordance with the exchange of notes and clearly stipulated. It is estimated that the Ministry of Railways will be able to borrow two-thirds of the entire British Boxer Indemnity, the Huai River Waterways Commission will be able to borrow 40% of one-third of the entire British Boxer Indemnity, the Guangdong River Management Committee will be able to borrow 20% of one-third of the entire British Boxer Indemnity, and the Construction Committee, the Ministry of Industry, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee will each be able to borrow one-third of 40% of one-third of the entire British Boxer Indemnity.</p>

<h3>Disturbance at the Chinese Public School</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Open House: Students Refused to Pick Up Scraps of Paper and Fruit Peels</p>
<p>British Teacher Slaps Student: Ordered to Leave the School</p>
<p>At the Chinese Public School at 63 Haskell Road, an open house was held yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. About seven or eight hundred students and parents attended. When the parents were having tea and snacks, scraps of paper and fruit peels were scattered all over the ground. A British teacher (Anslice) then ordered the student Hong Zu Xiu (a student in the second B class of junior high school) to pick them up from the ground. Hong refused because cleaning up the venue was the responsibility of the school staff. The teacher slapped Hong with his hand and dragged him to the classroom on the second floor, where he punched him in the face and other places. All the students in the third year of junior high school witnessed this and were extremely angry. They expressed a common opinion, and together with the parents present, led by Hong Zu Xiu's father, they negotiated with the principal. Unexpectedly, Principal J. Moffat sided with the teacher, saying that the student had disobeyed orders and deserved to be punished. At that time, He Sheng Chang, a student in the third year of junior high school, spoke passionately and argued reasonably, but the principal, running out of arguments, turned red and became angry with He Sheng Chang, grabbing him, slapping him several times, and immediately expelling all the students and parents from the school, sealing the school gate.</p>

<h3>Lawn Tennis League</h3>
<p>Chinese Association Suffers Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>Yesterday, they lost to the Country General Association by a score of seven to eight. Yesterday, in a situation where sweat poured down like rain and iced drinks offered little relief, the Chinese Tennis Association unexpectedly lost to the Flag Country General Association by a score of seven to eight. Amidst the economic downturn, the only consoling aspect was that the five groups continued to maintain their undefeated streak of straight sets. It is said that Feng Xikang and Guo Qida can maintain their winning record of straight sets in this season's lawn tennis league, due to their rich experience and exceptional stability. Yesterday, there was a large crowd of spectators at the Chinese tennis court. The first group, Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia, who were under the watchful eyes of the crowd, failed to fully demonstrate their strengths. Their opponents, the double pair of Shi Guiya, were quite experienced, and his partner, Sally Wen's serve, was unparalleled in Shanghai, exuding the demeanor of a world-class player. They won the first set easily with a score of six to three. In the second set, Lin and Zheng regained ground with a score of six to one. In the third set, Lin and Zheng initially fell behind two to five, and in the next game, they were down one to three. They narrowly avoided defeat and exerted tremendous effort to turn the tide, ultimately winning with a score of eleven to nine. With a score of two to one, the game belonged to our victory. The fourth group of the Chinese team was completely defeated, while the third and second groups lost with scores of one to two. When the first, third, fourth, and fifth groups finished, the total score was seven to seven. The second group, whose victory or defeat was crucial, was eagerly awaited. After a long period of time, the Chinese group ultimately lost with a score of one to two, affecting the overall outcome. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lin Baohua, Zheng Zhaojia 3-6, 6-1, 11-9 vs. Shi Guiya, Sally Wen</p>
<p>(2) Smith, Hongsbao 9-11, 6-4, 6-3 vs. Jiang Daozhang, Yu Tianguang</p>
<p>(3) Ke Laiya, Mai Tangna 7-5, 1-6, 7-5 vs. Tu Yuan, Liang Deguan</p>
<p>(4) Hai Er, Henliqui 6-3, 6-1, 7-5 vs. Qian Yaobin, Wu Zhuren</p>
<p>(5) Feng Xikang, Guo Qida 6-2, 7-5, 6-3 vs. Hui Si, Po Lasi</p>
<p>World Games</p>
<h3>Athletes from Various Countries Continue to Arrive in Los Angeles</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Los Angeles, 12th Dispatch. The tenth Olympic Games are approaching, and athletes from countries such as England, Italy, France, and Germany have been arriving one after another. These athletes have begun practicing at the competition venues and swimming pools to familiarize themselves with the local conditions. They are all in high spirits and maintain a strong sense of friendship. International camaraderie is also very warm. The kings of swimming are athletes from Japan, the United States, and Germany. Therefore, Japanese athletes are diligently practicing, hoping to win the championship at this event. However, the intense summer heat of the Southern countries, according to Li Wai, is causing a stinging sensation in the eyes of the swimmers who immerse themselves in the swimming pool. Due to the increased participation of athletes from various countries, the training time for Japanese athletes has been reduced, so they are seeking other swimming pools for practice.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of the World Games</h3>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>(8) Review of Past Field and Track Competitions (Middle)</p>
<p>Fifth Session Although the aforementioned sessions were not yet free from their initial stages, the truly worthy World Olympic Games began with the fifth session in London, England, in 1908. The number of events increased to twenty-three, and most of the events set new records. The astonishing performances of Canada, South Africa, and Sweden added greatly to the spectacle of the Games. The United States experienced its first losses in the 100-meter and 200-meter races. American athletes won only the 800-meter, 1500-meter, marathon, high hurdle, and intermediate hurdle events. 巴特's time of one minute and 52.8 seconds in the 800-meter race remained unbroken for a long time, until it was surpassed by German doctor 貝爾則 at Stanford Bridge in 1926. The consecutive victories of 弗浪那根 in the hammer throw event are also noteworthy. At the closing of the session, the United States remained the champion, but the outstanding performance of British athletes marked the first time they had posed a serious challenge to the American athletes.</p>
<p>Sixth Session The session was held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, in 1912. The solemn and magnificent opening ceremony was unprecedented. The results of the Games produced numerous new world records. The outstanding performances of 克雷 (USA) in the 100-meter and 200-meter races, 茂雷迪斯 (USA) in the 800-meter race, 傑克遜 (England) in the 1500-meter race, and 枸爾梅尼 (Finland) in the 5000-meter and 10000-meter races were truly remarkable. These are just a few examples from the track events. In the field events, the long jump was just under 25 feet, the pole vault was nearly 13 feet, the javelin throw reached approximately 200 feet, the discus throw was around 150 feet, and the shot put exceeded 50 feet. Only four records from 1908 remained unbroken. With the continued dominance of the United States and the emergence of strong athletes from countries such as Finland and Sweden, the World Olympic Games reached a new level of competitiveness. Enthusiasts believed that the next session in 1916 would produce even more incredible results.</p>
<p>During the European War Unexpectedly, misfortune struck. The outbreak of the war prevented athletes from competing in track and field events. Instead, they went to the battlefield. The seventh Olympic Games, originally scheduled to be held in Berlin, Germany, in 1916, was destroyed by the ashes of the European War.</p>
<p>Seventh Session After the European War, the small European countries suffered deeply and began to actively promote sports to strengthen the physical fitness of their citizens. At the seventh session in 1920, which was restored in Antwerp, the capital of Belgium, Finnish athletes emerged as a new force, creating a special situation in the World Olympic Games. At the same time, the impact of the war caused some athletes to fall behind, resulting in a balanced situation with advances and setbacks. In the intense competition, the pole vault reached a new world record of 4.09 meters, and the javelin throw reached 65.78 meters. The time of 14.8 seconds in the 110-meter hurdles by 加拿大托姆遜 was particularly shocking. Notably, the veteran hero 芬蘭柯爾梅尼 returned and won the marathon, shortening the previous record by thirteen seconds. 芬蘭納米 made his debut at the event, winning the 5000-meter and 10000-meter cross-country races. He later set world records in events ranging from one mile to five miles as easily as reaching into his pocket.</p>

<h3>Poetic Prophecy</h3>
<p>Strange! Du Mu, a poet of the Tang Dynasty, was actually a prophet! His abilities were similar to those of Li Chunfeng and Liu Bowen; his "Autumn Evening" poem also possessed the same mystery as the "Tui Bei Tu" and the "Shaobing Song"!</p>
<p>"Silver candles in the autumn night cast a cold light on the painted screen, a small silk fan brushes away fireflies; the steps of heaven are cold as water in the night, I lie and watch the Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars." Isn't this poem familiar to everyone? It's simply thought to be about an autumn evening in the Tang Dynasty! Who knew it would instead be about an autumn evening in Beiping in the 21st year of the Republic [1932], composed out of a sense of indignation towards the Beiping authorities' large-scale arrest of movie stars.</p>
<p>Movie stars rely entirely on excitement on the silver screen; now, they've become silver candles casting a cold light on the painted screen. The silver screen is desolate; one can imagine the scene. This is the first line of the poetic prophecy.</p>
<p>What are fireflies? Of course, they're stars. In ancient poetry, fireflies are always compared to stars; lines like "soaring in the sky like stars" and "scattered like stars, wanting to approach the moon before the railings" are proof of this. Du Mu's "a small silk fan brushes away fireflies" refers to the large-scale arrest of movie stars. The "罗" [luo, silk] in "轻罗" [qing lu, light silk] is borrowed to reflect the "罗" [luo, net] in "罗网" [luo wang, net]. A large number of movie stars were easily caught in the net; it truly was a case of "a small silk fan brushes away fireflies". This is the second line of the poetic prophecy.</p>
<p>Beiping was the capital of past emperors; the phrase "天阶" [tian jie, steps of heaven] likely refers to the heavenly prison. The character "阶" [jie, steps] means "prisoner in the dungeon". Male and female movie stars were arrested together; male stars are naturally the Cowherd, and female stars are naturally the Weaver Girl. In the dungeon, the autumn is cool as water; how pitiful it is to see these male and female stars lying inside! This is the prophecy of the third and fourth lines.</p>
<p>How wondrous and strange; Mr. Du Mu can become sworn brothers with Chunfeng and Bowen, becoming a trio among the prophets.</p>
<h3>A Narration on the Origin of Pork Floss</h3>
<p>— Bicheng</p>
<p>One day, I took a steamer from Anting to Taicang. There were two people on the boat, speaking the Taicang dialect. They brought out wine and drank together, accompanied by Taicang-style pork floss. They drank and talked with relish. A guest asked about the popularity of pork floss. They said that it originated with Ni Hongshun of Taicang. Even in the vast commercial port of Shanghai today, sellers of pork floss still display Ni Hongshun's old brand. Just like the soy duck and soy meat of Lao Sanzhen and Lu Gaojian, using this brand is necessary to show high quality. Is it the same for Ni Hongshun's pork floss? One of the drinkers stopped his cup and replied, "Indeed. However, Ni Hongshun was not the originator of pork floss. In fact, it was created by a prominent official with a reputation in politics. Who was this person? It was none other than Qian Tiaofu, Minister Qian Dingming of Taicang." During the early years of Tongzhi, when Suzhou and Changzhou fell to the rebels, Qian Gong, as a licentiate representative of the Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang prefectures, requested troops from Governor-General Zeng. Governor-General Zeng then dispatched Li Hongzhang to lead troops from Shanghai, thereby pacifying the various prefectures. Qian Gong also abandoned his pen and joined the military. Later, he became Governor of Hunan. It is said that at that time, the cooks in the Governor's residence were highly skilled at seasoning and were good at creating new foods, not sticking to old methods. It is a pity that they did not emulate the Old Man of Suiyuan and write a cookbook to benefit the elderly. However, even this one dish of pork floss has brought great fame to Taicang and greatly benefited the Ni family, a result that cannot be considered unadmirable. According to the method of making pork floss, there is a special secret. It is said that snake oil must be used to prevent spoilage over time. Stored in containers, there is no need to remove the air, which is comparable to today's canned food. Even more strange is that the use of snake oil repels mosquitoes and flies. Based on this principle, microorganisms may not easily grow within it. As for the deliciousness of the flavor, it is also due to the use of snake oil. It is said that when Qian Gong retired to private life, he often made pork floss to entertain guests. It was made by Hongshun, who had served Gong in Hunan for a long time and had a good understanding of cooking. When Gong returned, he taught him the method of making pork floss. After Gong's death, Hongshun used his skills to set up a pork floss stall. He used his own name to print paper for the brand. After more than a year, he accumulated some capital and rented a house to set up a shop. Year after year, business prospered. Today, stores are opened in major cities, run by his children and grandchildren. However, it is no longer known whether snake oil is still used. Although Taicang is the place of origin, it is not closely studied today. However, the three characters 'Ni Hongshun' are still used as a brand to attract customers. In the future, they may even use phrases such as 'The First House' as a necessary trend. The guest listened and nodded. I then wrote it down for the compilation of local history."</p>
<h3>Peculiar Production Methods</h3>
<p>— Binlang</p>
<p>Recently, a friend wrote from Moscow, mentioning that since the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan in Russia, the entire country, regardless of gender, has been dedicated to their respective roles, striving to advance the cause of production. This spirit of diligence and thrift is worthy of admiration. He said that in Soviet Russia, not even a blade of grass or a handful of soil is easily discarded. All potential industrial raw materials are sought everywhere with meticulous attention. For example, the recent research and utilization of "dog hair" is also worthy of note. The authorities have counted the total number of "dogs" in the country, estimating it at twenty-five million. These many dogs can supply two thousand tons of dog hair annually. Such a huge amount of dog hair provides considerable support to the wool industry in the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, a nationwide order has been issued, urging people to shear dog hair and sell it at a price. The general idea is: "In general, livestock with long hair suffer from increased heat and constant panting in the summer. Dogs are beneficial domestic animals to humans. Their hair should be sheared and sold at a price. Not only is it beneficial to the dog's hygiene, but it can also significantly increase the output of industrial raw materials." As a result, almost all shorn dogs can be seen throughout Russia. Naturally, the increase in dog hair is not small. That kind of production method is truly groundbreaking.</p>
<h3>About Women</h3>
<p>— Liusha</p>
<p>Euphemisms for menstruation are avoided by most women, who replace them with various different terms. According to Xu Ou, "[Among the Latin and Teutonic peoples, the term 'menstruation' is commonly replaced with the equivalent term 'flowers,' because flowers symbolize the possibility of fruition.]" According to Du De, "[Some uncivilized tribes refer to menstruation as 'wearing deerskin' or 'going out'.]"</p>
<p>German women use the idiom "[I have mail again]" or "[Aunt has arrived]" when menstruating. Chinese women say "[The body has come]" or "[The mother-in-law has come]". However, Chinese female students often use "Menses" or "Bad Days" as substitutes.</p>
<p>Women's Pants In ancient China, women not only wore pants during the day but also refused to take them off when sleeping at night, and the pants of so-called upper-class women were tied even tighter when sleeping. However, the situation is quite different in the West. Originally, pants were Eastern clothing and seemed to have spread to Europe from Venice. Those who first adopted them in Europe were mostly prostitutes. It is said that if someone asked a peasant girl if she wore pants, she would exclaim, "[Would I wear pants? Madam! I am a respectable girl!]" According to a book published by Muir in 1783, Parisian women, except for actresses, did not wear pants. Of course, this trend has changed now.</p>

<h3>Random Talks by Di Xiangqi</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoxu</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoxu's reputation does not come from his calligraphy or poetry initially. The world uniquely calls him a master of calligraphy and poetry. This is true. But in the rise and fall of Qing Dynasty politics, he often planned and was in fact a politician. He passed the provincial examination in the Renwu year and became a secretary in the central government. Ashamed to be a low-ranking official, he had the intention to leave. He told people, "Serving as an official and holding a low rank, one must cater to superiors every day. One can still have enough to eat and be warm outside, but those who live inside are so poor that they cannot support themselves. I do not want to stay in this position for long." So he left. Later he changed to office in Jiangsu. After that, he was stationed in Kobe as consul. Zheng Xiaoxu's interactions with Japanese people began at this time. Governor Zhang Zhidong heard his name and recruited him into his staff. He also submitted a memorial praising his talent as capable of great use, and he was granted the rank of Daotai. At that time, officials in Hubei often referred to him as Chief Secretary Zheng. His influence was evident. Zhidong had a long-standing relationship with Wang Renkan (Kezhuang)'s several sons. One of them was appointed to the province as a sub-prefect and wanted to join the governor's staff. He asked Liang Jie'an (Dingfen) to speak on his behalf to Zhidong. Zhidong remained silent. He persisted in his request and was scolded angrily. He desperately sought advancement. Unable to obtain his request, he would not give up. He once told Dingfen about this matter. Dingfen said, "It will definitely be reported." There was an errand to the Governor, and he spoke as before. Xiaoxu happened to be present. Zhidong, waited until he finished speaking, and said angrily, "My staff doesn't need talented people. Someone like that may not be able to do it." "You are in charge of the Lianghu Academy. How about bringing him in as an assistant to treat people and manage affairs?" Dingfen agreed. Xiaoxu said, "I do not think so. In the world, whose writing is better than yours, teacher? In the world, whose official documents are better than yours? It is easy to be a secretary for others, but difficult to be a secretary for a master. Precisely because it is difficult, someone must want it. They will seek knowledge from it. Kezhuang is a talented scholar. His son must be a mediocre person. We must investigate." He looked at Dingfen. Dingfen said, "Su is very eloquent and truly understands my heart. I wanted to say it but dared not speak." Zhidong smiled and said, "Su is eloquent but sarcastic. Jie'an also has a hidden meaning. If I don't agree, both of you will be unhappy. If I agree, I should try him with something. Allow me to scrutinize it carefully." In less than five days, the order came. People like to praise and denigrate. How could Zhidong not do so? Xiaoxu was good at words, so he achieved what Dingfen had repeatedly failed to do in a few words. He was truly understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhu believes that in this martial environment, it would be best for children to take a course in martial arts first, learning to be a little soldier. He suggested teaching the children some boxing techniques. This would be easy to arrange. Although Master Zhang had only been teaching for a short time, he had already found more than a dozen very promising disciples. They also wanted to drag me in as a children's boxing instructor. These dozen or so of us would be sufficient for distribution, and Master Zhang would not have to trouble himself. Just imagine how impressive it would be to see those little fists swinging around on the grass, witnessed by relatives and friends!</p>
<p>Fifty-six</p>
<p>"The children are here to study, how can they always be boxing?" Some ignorant people might say this. Mr. Zhu and I had anticipated this point. Just as he was calling me to have the students come read and learn characters, I was about to make a suggestion to him. I knew that my views were correct, and I was very happy. These are the texts that Mr. Zhu himself wrote.</p>

<h3>Double Red Beans</h3>
<p>— Wu Dongyuan</p>
<p>In commemoration of the 60th anniversary of Shen Bao, I recall Cai Zifu, Zou Jiugai, Tiannan Dun Sou, Gao Changhan Shisheng and other elders, who have passed away one after another. Now Yu Wang Dungen, Chen Xuyuan, and Zhou Shoujuan, three gentlemen, have been in close acquaintance for twenty years and have been connected across thousands of miles. I compose this to offer a smile and wish Shen Bao Museum ten thousand years.</p>
<p>Zhou Caochuang. Wu Mengchuang. Double red beans in longing from two places. Tracing back to the Huangpu River. Writing field. Ink fragrance. A paper travels thousands of miles. Article light of the sun and moon.</p>
<p>Sentences Welcome Du Ling Yincheng, Disclosed by Shen Bao</p>
<p>Now I compose seven more chapters to send her away</p>
<p>(Old Envoy of Three Jins)</p>
<p>Difficult to dispel the shadows of dreams, send melancholy to ask for singing, Du Lixue. No need to look at words to know your state. Filial piety is more than just shame for hairpins and skirts. Intending to use open eyes to play in the meeting place. Searching for a seat that staggers is not yet fulfilled. It avoids dispersing the scene and terror. The Dharma Gate is shaken and loses the Wang Lang. Su San writes generations of astringent pearl throats. Or feels that the prince is ashamed. Famous cases should increase the folding chain. Calling Tianjin City is also an empty building. Understanding that joy is the root of misfortune. Sending grievances to strange changes is also what I guess. The illusion of the play is a matter of a moment. How is it like a transformation outside the play? Infinite chanting chapters open two eyes. I don't know how to press the sword is also a pearl. The tiger's head is accustomed to being arrogant. Only the iron bones are gentle to Fangqing. The poetry scene is different from the past. Another demon is replaced by another. The great magic is like a game. Locking only to the shape. At first glance, the Tao should be enlightened by Zen. The amorous words are forgotten to be deleted, that is, Buddha Immortal. The immortals and Buddhas have never deleted amorous words. The sweet and wonderful truth is born from the tongue.</p>

<h3>Interest Rate Skyrockets</h3>
<p>The recent surge in foreign interest rates has been spurred by the clamor for converting to a foreign currency standard. Banks, preparing for this change, have been competing to purchase foreign currency, resulting in a gradual increase in rates. Yesterday saw a particularly dramatic rise, with rates soaring by roughly three percent compared to the previous day. The silver interest rate, influenced by foreign banks absorbing cash, has also caused a squeeze in the market's active capital, leading to a sudden surge in overnight rates.

[Silver Interest] The early morning rate was 1 qian and 1 fen, higher by 2 fen compared to the previous day. The afternoon rate continued to rise by 4 fen, reaching 1 qian and 5 fen, a very strong situation. Consequently, the overnight rate surged to a massive 2 qian and 5 fen, the highest rate seen this month. Bank postings also showed a 4 fen rise.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currencies: Guangdong Small Coin Rises. Jiangnan small foreign coins fell back yesterday due to the excessively high price of the previous day. The early morning rate was 6 qian and 8 li, a slight decrease of 1 li. The afternoon rate was 6 qian and 7 li, continuing to fall by 1 li. There were 3,500 coins traded in the morning and 4,000 coins in the afternoon. Guangdong small foreign coins were priced at 5 qian, 9 fen, 1 li and a half in the morning, and 5 qian, 9 fen, 1 li and 7 hao in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 4 li compared to the previous day. There were 140,000 coins traded in the morning and 65,000 coins in the afternoon. Copper coins continued to decline by 1,000 wen to 414,000 wen, with only slightly over 34,700 strings of wen traded.</p>

Foreign firms received and paid out 1.4 to 1.5 million. Various kinds of goods exchange, special telegrams and miscellaneous items totaled over 5 million. The amount received was over 1 million. Only 800,000 entered the warehouse. Chinese banks received over 1.1 million in drafts, and paid out over 1.2 million. Various taxes, miscellaneous exchange, and pledge items totaled over 5.45 million. 300,000 were taken out of the warehouse.

<h3>New York Stock Market: Initially Strong, Then Soft</h3>
<p>(Report by the American Eastern Banking Corporation)</p>
<p>(Mixed Gains and Losses Compared to Monday)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the New York stock market, continuing the upward momentum from the previous day, maintained a steady climb. However, as the closing hour approached, selling pressure intensified, causing prices to plummet. Industrial stocks experienced slight losses compared to the previous day, while railway and utility stocks saw marginal gains. The bond market performed well, with another tenth of the planned joint bank purchase of bonds being realized (7 million yuan). The ultimate downturn in stock prices was attributed to declines in the prices of cotton, wheat, and meat on the same day. Furthermore, the total credit extension of the Federal Reserve System decreased by 22 million yuan, indicating that society was not urgently seeking funds to develop new businesses, which had a negative impact on market sentiment. Nevertheless, Tuesday's situation suggested a growing interest among investors in purchasing lower-value stocks, especially those linked to increases in commodity prices. The Dow Jones Indices for Tuesday are listed below:</p>
<p>July 11th | July 12th | Change</p>
<p>30 Industrials | 42.98 | 42.68 | Down 0.30</p>

<p>[Cotton Yarn Market]</p>
<p>Human-Tagged Yarn Sees Minor Fluctuations</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices Drop by Five or Six Taels</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market remains calm, but spot yarn sales are slow. Due to substantial purchases by Yunnan and Guangdong buyers, factories' spot inventories are tightening. The price of human-tagged yarn for July is five or six taels lower than the spot price, causing factories to be reluctant to deliver. However, one yarn factory delivered approximately 2,000 bales, with no other deliveries reported. While the financial situation remains tight, buyers are still confident. However, most sellers are selling due to the weakness of imported cotton, causing significant pressure. The future is uncertain.</p>
<p>Minor Fluctuations in Human-Tagged Yarn Prices. In the morning session, human-tagged yarn prices initially fell by 7 or 8 qian due to falling U.S. cotton prices. Prices then gradually recovered, resulting in a slight increase of 1.3 qian. The price of forward contracts fell by 2.4 qian. In the afternoon, the situation eased, with prices falling by 2, 3, or 4 qian for each month. Total transactions for the day were 19,100 bales. Rui Da sold 900 bales, Da Ji sold 600 bales, Ming De sold 850 bales, and Yuan Da sold 550 bales. Guang Feng bought 1,150 bales, Chang Feng bought 2,005 bales, and Shen Ji bought 600 bales. The closing prices for human-tagged yarn are listed below:</p>
<p>Human-Tagged Yarn | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Inventory</p>
<p>October | 1446 | Down 4 | 77,000</p>
<p>July | 1433 | - | 15,200 | November | 1446 | Down 5 | 82,050</p>
<p>August | 1440 | Down 3 | 39,550 | December | 1446 | Down 7 | 48,250</p>
<p>September | 1445 | Down 1 | 60,100 | Total | - | 322,150</p>
<p>Stable Spot Yarn Market. Spot yarn sales are good, with a total of 1,150 bales purchased by various groups throughout the day. Sales to peers totaled 25 bales. Prices remain stable.

<h3>Cotton Market at an Impasse</h3>
<p>Rumors of Japanese Merchants Collecting Spot Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market initially declined but then stabilized. However, U.S. cotton conditions are weakening, causing Xin Cheng to sell steadily. Retail investors are buying as prices fall. The reason is that the gold market is unlikely to decline significantly, and a certain Japanese cotton firm is heavily collecting spot cotton. According to some, hundreds of bales of cotton delivered by sellers of July-tagged cotton have been purchased by Japanese merchants. This has caused more merchants to take long positions. However, given the overall situation, the cotton market remains depressed. Low inventories of local cotton, coupled with Japanese intervention, make the future uncertain.</p>
<p>Zheng-Tagged Cotton Recovers Slightly After Falling. In the morning session, Zheng-tagged cotton prices opened lower due to falling U.S. cotton prices, with large sellers selling off, causing prices to fall by 5 qian. Prices then recovered in later trading, resulting in an overall decline of 2 qian. The afternoon market remained stable, with prices fluctuating by 5 fen to 1 qian for each month. Total transactions for the day were 55,200 dan. Ming De sold 3,100 dan, Xin Cheng sold 6,600 dan, Tong Xing sold 1,200 dan, and Yi Yu sold 1,100 dan. Yuan Da bought 4,500 dan, Yuan Da bought 2,500 dan, Rong Xing bought 2,600 dan, and De Ji bought 2,300 dan. The closing prices for Zheng-tagged cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng-Tagged Cotton | Closing Price | Change | Inventory</p>
<p>November | 3080 | Down 25 | 191,800</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Falls 15 Points</h3>
<p>Weak Spot Demand...Longs Liquidate</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton prices weakened due to good weather, weak spot demand, and long liquidation. Futures fell by 14 to 15 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. British cotton futures fell by 3 points, and spot prices rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 12th):</p>

<h3>Large Increase in Imports of Japanese Cloth to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Imports of cotton cloth and rayon fabrics from Japan in June were exceptionally high, the highest since September of last year, totaling 3,101 bales, a sharp increase from 800 bales in May. It is said that these were all pre-ordered goods.</p>
<p>[Grain Market: Rice Market Declines Further]</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, the rice market saw approximately ten suppliers arrive, but urban and rural sales were sluggish. Changshu and Xibei japonica rice prices fell by another two jiao.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, the rice market had a large influx of supplies from the hinterland, with abundant stocks. Sales were quiet and sentiment was weak. Thick japonica rice prices fell by about one jiao. Old rice from Zhongguan received no interest. Thin rice was being sold off at a discount of three jiao. Very few transactions took place in the morning. Prices fell by about one jiao. Luyang glutinous rice prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Northern Merchants Continue to Procure Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Persistent Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was quite active. There were new transactions from Tianjin merchants. Both Ningbo merchants and local villages were making inquiries, and the market was busy. Prices rose by a slight 2 jiao because of the hot weather and concerns the rice might spoil. Sellers were eager to sell at any price. On the day the Tianjin merchants bought 1,000 bags of the small variety. Local merchants and villages bought 2,500 bags of the small variety. The Ningbo merchants bought 1,500 bags of the small variety.</p>
<p>There has been no trade in forward rice for a long time. Yesterday, Saigon No. 1, 100 tons due in July, was offered at 4 taels and 7 mace. This was an internal affair for merchants to go to and from their hometowns, and new transactions were difficult to negotiate. At 10 yuan this would lose more than a yuan when compared to the previous price of 5 taels 2 to 3 mace.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Returns to Depression</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw prices fall after the morning opening. The price of foreign wheat fell by approximately 1.1 to 1.3 jiao. Prices neared the lowest record from last year. Market sentiment was weak, due to this and sales by Fufeng. Standard contracts for the current month could also be bought. People are concerned about both the abundant supply of spot goods, and the low prices on international markets. Market sentiment turned weak. The state of international market and the large factories seems inappropriate. In the end, the price of contracts for July and August fell by 7.5 li, the price of the September contract fell by 5 li. The price of the October and November contracts didn’t move, and the price of the December contract fell by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Inland Buyers Strong for Wheat</h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat futures market yesterday, there was an initial balance then prices improved. Trading was quiet, and prices were stable for this month’s contracts. There were fewer sellers of August and September contracts, and there was stronger demand from inland buyers, and the market was better as a result. However, the price of foreign wheat was down, making it inadvisable to be overly optimistic about the future. There was no movement for the current month’s contracts. The price of contracts for August and September were up 2 fen from the day before. Trading in the spot wheat market was flat as the supply had reached a balance, and factories were only fulfilling existing obligations. White Crane Lane Wheat was 2 taels and 6 qian and 8 fen, Changshu Wheat was 2 taels and 8 qian and 6 fen, Wusong Wheat was 2 taels and 7 qian, Anting Wheat was 2 taels and 6 qian and 8 fen, Shuangfeng Wheat was 2 taels and 8 qian, Zhitang Wheat was 2 taels and 8 qian, Xiangqiao Wheat was 2 taels and 8 qian and 3 fen, with the total being 2,000 bags, bought by Fuxin, Fufeng, and Xin Da.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Prices Decline in Quiet Trading</h3>
<p>Rumors of Industry Organization to Sell Publicly</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the Shanghai Sugar Exchange started with active buying, but prices were very low. Dutch sugar No. 24 was sold for 14 taels and 3 qian. Industry insiders said that the Finance Ministry had approved a remission of one half of the tax differences for Dutch sugar ordered in February and March, causing buyers to disappear, and the market weakened. There were no purchases. Taikoo sugar prices were, B -16 taels and 3 qian, DY -15 taels and 5 qian and 5 fen, CW -15 taels and 8 qian, trade was weak and prices were settling.</p>
<p>To save Dutch sugar from collapse, the industry is planning to sell rough and white sugar publically. It’s rumored that internal arrangements are nearly done. A general industry meeting will be held to discuss the decision.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Still Lacking Vitality</h3>
<p>European and American markets continue to weaken on Chinese silk prices; telegram transactions are sparse. Chinese silk merchants face significant losses from unsold stock. Domestic silk factories are also struggling due to the low-priced Japanese silk eroding sales. Market sentiment remains weak. Yesterday, only Dachang advanced with a Class B shipment of 13-15 bundles of Shanghai white factory silk, priced at only 520 taels. Samsung and others advanced with 15 bundles of second-grade yellow coarse silk, priced from 320 to 285 taels.</p>
<h3>Tea Firms Enjoy Brisk European Sales of High-Quality Mei Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, major British firms such as Xiehe, Yihua, and Jinjiang received substantial orders from Morocco for high-quality Mei green tea from Wudong, Tunxi, and other regions. They have begun large-scale procurement. Other traders are also taking advantage of the opportunity to purchase. Total transactions for Mei tea reached over 3,000 cases citywide. Transactions for Zhen Mei and Zhu tea of various grades are also trending upward. The long-depressed green tea market is showing signs of improvement. High-grade Qimen black tea is seeing increased activity, but the market for medium and low-grade tea remains sluggish.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>Nirong Sales Only Slightly Improved by the Dachuan Group</p>
<p>During this season, nirong (woolen fabric) transactions are weak. Yesterday, only the Dachuan group within the Dachuan Tong, Taikoo Yu, and Yihua Yu firms saw slight improvement. Plaid, solid color, and iridescent "Huade" nirong continued to be sold, but shipments were generally slow. Although the exchange rate shrank by 20 taels yesterday, it still required 260-270 taels per 1,000 taels, making it difficult to remit silver to Shanghai. Shanghai traders are advocating for shipments after prices fall. Aside from the Dachuan group, other small Sichuan groups from the Guandong, North China, and Yangtze River regions have shown no interest.</p>
<h3>Metals: Pig Lead Price Falls to 36 Yuan</h3>
<p>The overseas price of pig lead has plummeted. Yesterday's telegram indicated a price of only 36 gold yuan per ton, the lowest in decades. (This translates to only 10 taels in the Shanghai market, including all external expenses.) Consequently, the local market has been severely affected, with the standard price falling from 12 taels and 2.5 qian to 11 taels and 5 qian. However, with the current hot weather, sales are exceptionally slow, and the outlook is quite pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Procures Military Hardware</h3>
<p>The metal market is sluggish due to the continuous hot weather. Besides minor transactions from a few factories, there are very few large-scale deals. However, yesterday saw a sudden surge in activity from the Soviet Russian authorities, who are urgently procuring a large quantity of military hardware in Shanghai, totaling over 4,000 dan. The purchased items include over 1,200 dan of #12 new lead wire, driving up the price by several qian. The market price rose from 9 taels and 5 qian to 10 taels and 2.5 qian. It is reported that the cargo arriving at the six banks in a week has also been purchased at a price of 9 taels and 8 or 9 qian. The current spot market is almost completely depleted. Over 500 bundles of "Huayuan" lead wire were offered at a price of 5 taels. Transactions also occurred for Three-Sheet black iron, thick steel plates, and tinplate, but their prices did not fluctuate much. In addition, there were inquiries for pig lead, copper, and pure antimony, but no firm deals were made.</p>

<h3>Cai and Yang Joint Statement</h3>
<p>Withdraw Guarantee for Noulens' Release for Medical Treatment</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Xingfo traveled to Beijing by train on Sunday evening to work with Mr. Cai Yuanpei to petition the Jiangsu High Court to release Mr. and Mrs. Noulens on bail for medical treatment. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and issued the following joint statement with Mr. Cai: [“Yuanpei, etc., are concerned that Noulens is on the verge of death after a ten-day hunger strike in the detention center. Out of humanitarian concern, with the agreement of all parties, we submitted a request to the Jiangsu High Court to release him on bail for treatment at a Shanghai sanatorium. After two days of negotiations, there was no result, and Minister Luo of the Ministry of Justice unexpectedly resigned due to this matter. Yuanpei, etc., have no choice but to request the withdrawal of the guarantee, in the hope that Minister Luo will resume his post immediately. In addition to a letter to the Jiangsu High Court, we hereby make this public.”]</p>
<h3>Re-examination of Russian Beggar's Corpse</h3>
<p>No Injuries Found</p>
<p>Joint Examination by Renowned British and French Doctors</p>
<p>Brother of the Deceased Signs for and Claims Coffin</p>
<p>The suspicious death of Russian beggar Georgie Radikeff in the detention center of the Second Special District Court was re-examined yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the body examination facility of the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Dallas Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hiring Renowned British and French Doctors: Out of caution, the court, through the Chief Justice Ying Shi, instructed the forensic doctor Wei Ligong to invite renowned Shanghai forensic doctors to the scene for examination to ensure impartiality. Dr. Wei recommended Dr. Smith, the Commissioner of Health and Superintendent of the Hospital of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and French forensic doctor Dr. Villie, and Chief Justice Ying personally invited them. The two doctors arrived on time at 9:30 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Personnel Present: Chief Justice Ying Shi, Criminal Court President Wang Wangxu, along with Head Clerk Xiao Jinfang, Clerk Zhu Chengzhuo, Accounting Section Head Clerk Wei Yuwei, interpreters Zhang Dengqu, Dong Chang, Zhang Qingchun, forensic doctors Wei Ligong, Jiang Xuan, also arrived successively. From the Police Department were Western Detective Sa Cai'er, fingerprinting and photography section chief Yu Ai'tuo, translator Xu Fengshu, lawyer Fei Xizhen, Shanghai Municipal Council Legal Advisor Dou Ge, and the Police Department-hired forensic doctor Shandelei. The plaintiff, the deceased’s brother Simon Greyteke, along with his attorney Pu Laimei, also arrived.</p>
<p>Head and Face Skin Completely Decomposed: After all personnel gathered, the Tongren Fu Yuan Funeral Home was notified by telephone to send the collection director Zhang Yunsheng with the funeral workers Zhu Bingsheng, Yang Jinquan, and Li Guisheng to the scene. The coffin was removed from the cold storage, and the seal affixed by Tongren Fu Yuan Funeral Home was inspected by the personnel present. The coffin was then carried to the autopsy room in the back. Upon opening the coffin, the body was found to be decomposed, with the skin on the head and face completely decomposed.</p>
<p>No Wounds on Upper or Lower Body: The body was then placed on the autopsy table, and the coffin sides were removed. Forensic doctor Wei Ligong began the examination with Jiang Xuan recording the details. The three British and French doctors jointly examined the body. Police Department doctor Shandelei asked the deceased’s brother Simon Greyteke if he recognized the body. Simon replied that his brother was missing two teeth on the lower jaw and had a scar on his head. Upon examination, the head indeed had a scar, and the mouth was missing two teeth. Simon identified the deceased as his brother. Wei Ligong then conducted a detailed examination, with the three British and French doctors observing. No wounds were found on the head, face, nose, or body, confirming that the death was due to natural causes. The trousers worn by the deceased were also examined and showed signs of diarrhea, further proving that he had suffered from diarrhea before death. Wei Ligong then sawed off a piece of nasal bone and removed the trousers for further detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Interrogation of Brother After Examination: During the examination, Simon Greyteke argued that the deceased's trousers were black and questioned why they were now blue. He wanted to call a witness, Zhibu Dailaifu, to identify them. After the forensic examination, the results were reported to Chief Justice Ying. Judge Wang then instructed the funeral workers to nail the coffin shut and return it to the cold storage. Judge Wang then ordered Simon Greyteke to be interrogated. Simon had already invited witness Zhibu Dailaifu to the scene. The judge asked Simon, "Is this body your brother?" Simon answered, "He has a scar on his head and is missing two teeth, so it is likely him." The judge asked, "The deceased died in the detention center, was examined by the prosecutor, and was collected by Tongren Fu Yuan Funeral Home. Now, Tongren Fu Yuan Funeral Home has opened the coffin. Is that correct?" Simon answered, "Zhibu Dailaifu and my brother were detained together. He knows the color of his trousers. It would be clear if Zhibu Dailaifu could see them." The judge asked, "Did you see them during the examination?" Simon answered, "Yes, I did."</p>
<p>Issue of Trouser Color: The judge asked Zhibu Dailaifu, "The deceased is decomposed. How can you remember clearly?" Zhibu answered, "I can recognize them by looking." The judge ordered a bailiff to take Zhibu Dailaifu to the autopsy room to identify the body. Upon his return, the judge asked, "Is the body Georgie Radikeff? Are the clothes correct?" Zhibu answered, "The clothes were in the prison. He was not wearing them after death." The judge asked Simon, "Do you want to claim the body?" Simon answered, "The color of the trousers is wrong. I am suspicious." The judge then summoned Zhang Yunsheng, an employee of Tongren Fu Yuan Funeral Home, and asked about the collection process. Zhang answered that when they transported the body to the funeral home, the lower body was naked because the trousers were soiled and foul-smelling. Therefore, they were not put on but placed in the coffin. The feet were bare, without shoes. However, the collection record in the funeral home book has the number 1514 marked on the coffin head, so there can be no mistake.</p>
<p>Brother of the Deceased Signs for Coffin: The judge asked Simon again, "Today, we are examining the body of Russian Georgie Radikeff, who died in the detention center on June 19. Do you want to claim it, or should it be buried by Tongren Fu Yuan Funeral Home?" Simon answered, "I cannot say for sure if it is my brother, but I can claim it." The judge said, "You cannot be ambiguous." Simon answered, "I filed a request for examination on the 23rd. Why was it delayed until today? That is illegal." The judge said that the police department filed the lawsuit on July 7, and the trial was held the next day, so there was no delay. The judge added that since it was not his brother, he could not claim it. Simon hesitated for ten minutes and then answered, "I will claim it." The judge then ordered him to sign a receipt for the body. Judge Wang noted on the police department's release form that the body of Georgie Radikeff had been examined and was being claimed by Simon Greyteke for burial. The examination ended at 12:20 PM. During the examination, Zhou Zongxiang, a guard from the defendant detention center, also came to observe before leaving. Simon was taken to the police department by the Western Detective to await further processing.</p>
<h3>More Japanese Navy Returning Home Today</h3>
<p>Leaving Shanghai on the Tsushima Ship</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, almost half of the Japanese navy was dispatched to participate in the fighting. Subsequently, they were gradually withdrawn. The coastal defense ship Tsushima and over 300 sailors remained in Shanghai until the Sasebo reinforcement of 200 marines arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Tsushima and others were ordered to return to Japan.</p>
<p>Naval Withdrawal: The Japanese Naval Ministry dispatched a large naval unit of over 350 officers and sailors to Shanghai after the outbreak of the war. Today, they were ordered to withdraw, and their replacements have already been transported by the Nojima special service ship. The officers and sailors of the unit, along with their firearms and ammunition, boarded the specially dispatched transport ships Sakura Maru and Fengtian Maru, which docked at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu at 9:30 AM yesterday. They departed Shanghai, heading directly to the Sasebo Naval Port.</p>
<p>Departure of Tsushima: The Japanese coastal defense ship Tsushima, with a displacement of over 5,000 tons, also participated in the Japanese attack on Wusong. Today, it was ordered to return to Japan. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, it docked at the Huishan Wharf. Representatives of the Shanghai Japanese community, including Miri, Morika, Mitsui President Hayashi, and Naval Attaché to Shanghai Kitaoka, along with Major General Kuwahara and students from the Japanese Resident Elementary School, as well as veterans, came to see them off. Commander Sakonji of the Third Fleet sent a military band to the wharf to play music. At 10:10 AM, the ship departed Shanghai, heading directly back to Japan.</p>
<h3>Joint Committee to Convene Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Issue of Japanese Troops in the D District</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the D District, Japanese representative Okazaki has broken his promise twice recently. Chinese committee member Yu Hongjun decided yesterday to send a letter to Joint Committee member Cunningham, requesting that the Joint Committee be convened to resolve the issue. After back-and-forth negotiations, it has been decided to hold a meeting tomorrow (the 15th) at 10:00 AM to jointly discuss a solution.</p>
<p>Proposal to Convene a Meeting: Yesterday around 11:00 AM, due to the Japanese side breaking their promise twice, not only violating the spirit of the agreement but also violating international trust, Joint Committee member Yu Hongjun officially submitted a document to Chairman Cunningham requesting that a meeting of the entire committee be convened to jointly discuss and resolve the issue as soon as possible. The letter was sent out yesterday morning. An excerpt is as follows: (Omitted above) The Japanese troops in the D District and at the Hua Feng, Gong Da Feng Tian, and San Sha factories should have been completely withdrawn a month ago in accordance with the agreement signed on May 5. However, after a long period of time, the Japanese side has repeatedly expressed its intention to withdraw, but the result has been consistent delays without any sincere and definite response. Therefore, our committee reported the Japanese side's unreasonable delays to your honorable chairman on the 2nd of this month and requested your strong urging. We are extremely grateful for your repeated urging, but the Japanese side's excuses remain the same. Subsequently, the Japanese side also expressed several times to our committee, but only a small part of the Hua Feng yarn factory in Wusong was withdrawn as a result. After a meeting with Japanese representative Okazaki again on the 6th of this month, Okazaki promised to respond twice but failed to fulfill either promise. This case could have been brought to the Joint Committee for discussion long ago, but we always hoped that the Japanese side would uphold international credibility and withdraw immediately within the shortest possible time. Unfortunately, given the past attitude of the Japanese side, the provisions of the agreement have not been fulfilled. It is regrettable. The reason for having four temporary resident areas in the armistice agreement signed on May 5 was to accommodate the large number of Japanese troops and designate them as temporary resident areas. Now, the Japanese army has been completely withdrawn, and the vicinity of Shanghai has returned to its original state before the January 28th Incident. In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the agreement, the Japanese side should immediately withdraw the troops in the D District and at the Gong Da Feng Tian to within the areas beyond the concession boundaries (within the concession) in order to maintain the spirit of the agreement and to have the Japanese side express a definite date for withdrawal. Please, Mr. Chairman, convene a meeting of all committee members immediately to discuss, etc.</p>
<p>Joint Committee to Meet Tomorrow: Yu first handed the letter directly to Secretary Langer to be forwarded and then notified Langer by telephone. Subsequently, he received a reply from Langer stating that the matter had been forwarded to Cunningham and Japanese representative Okazaki had been notified. It was decided to hold the meeting at 10:00 AM on the 15th because the 14th is the French National Day, and it was feared that the French representative would be unable to attend. The location will still be the American Consulate.</p>
<h3>Representative of Mongolian Border Cavalry Describes</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Efforts in Northern Liaoning</p>
<p>Reception for Shanghai Press Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Appeal for Aid to Shanghai</p>
<p>Cheng Changkui, commander of the Mongolian Border Cavalry of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, recently sent representatives Zhuang Tianmin, Li Yingkai, and Huang Zhendong, chairman of the Shanghai Youth Volunteer Death Squad Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps, to Shanghai to request aid from all sectors. Yesterday afternoon, they hosted a reception for the press, where Huang Zhendong reported on the Shanghai Youth Volunteer Death Squad Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps's joining the Mongolian Border Cavalry and detailed the anti-Japanese combat. Huang said that the Shanghai Youth Volunteer Death Squad Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps, led by chairman Huang Zhendong, left Shanghai on June 7 and arrived in Ping on June 11. They then traveled through Recha Mongolian to Hei Yuanma, walking to the Ke Lu area. Along the way, they were warmly welcomed by the local authorities, and the commander of the Mongolian Border Cavalry, Cheng Changkui. Upon arriving in Ke Lu, they learned that the Re Border was in critical condition. The Mongolian Border Cavalry, stationed in Tongliao and Ke Lu, Liaoning Province, was bravely resisting the enemy. The team determined that the Tong-Ke area was a crucial area between Liaoning and Re Provinces. If anything untoward happened, Rehe would not be secure. It would be difficult to abandon what was near to save what was far away. Therefore, they immediately joined the force to fight the enemy together, in accordance with the principle that whoever resists Japan, we will support them. Huang also said that the commander of the Mongolian Border Cavalry, Cheng Changkui, is from Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, and is 42 years old. He graduated from the first class of the Northeast Martial Arts Academy and has held important positions in the military. Last year, he served as the chief of staff of the Mongolian Border Cavalry in northern Liaoning and as the commander of the central route. Now, he has been reorganized as the commander of the Mongolian Border Cavalry Detachment. Since the September 18th Incident, he has led his cavalry unit to occupy Tongliao and the Dalin Dahan area on the Siping-Taonan branch line, advancing towards Liaoyuan. However, due to the loss of Heishan County, which was occupied by friendly forces, and the intense shelling by enemy air force and artillery, they gradually became unsustainable after two days and nights of fierce fighting and retreated to the west of Tongliao. Both sides suffered heavy casualties in this battle. On December 14, after reorganizing his unit, he advanced east to Xishutong and encountered the enemy. After a fierce battle lasting one day and night, the enemy retreated. Our army immediately pursued and recovered Bola Huoshao Temple, Wafang, Liufangdi, Liujia Yuanzi, Sifangdi, Hujia Yuanzi, Wanglao Huiwopu, Yujian Company, and other places. In this battle, our army suffered few casualties, while the enemy suffered over 100 dead and 70 wounded. They also captured many spoils of war. On February 11, our army advanced to Yuliang Fort and encountered the enemy. On the 12th, they were surrounded by the enemy five times. Commander Cheng led his troops to use his self-invented flat-trajectory artillery to inflict heavy casualties. After a fierce battle lasting three days and nights, they finally repelled the enemy. In this battle, they killed a Japanese commander named Yushan and over 50 soldiers, wounded hundreds, and captured one enemy telescope, a full set of military maps, two machine guns, one cannon, and countless weapons and ammunition. Our army suffered over 70 wounded and over 30 dead. On March 17, they fought the enemy at Yingli Temple. After one day and night, the enemy retreated. Our army immediately pursued to Sanhuitang. On March 25, our army advanced to Sanhuitang. The enemy launched a fierce counterattack on our army. Our soldiers, risking their lives, resisted vigorously. After a fierce battle lasting two days and nights, the enemy finally retreated. Both sides suffered heavy casualties in this battle. So far, they have resisted for more than half a year and have fought the enemy dozens of times, finally preserving the corner of Tongliao until now. Of the more than 50 counties in Liaoning Province, this is the only area of a hundred square miles that has not been captured by the enemy. Now, the Re Border is in critical condition, and our army is at the forefront. If anything untoward happens, Rehe will be in danger. Since our army began resisting Japan, tens of thousands of patriotic people from home and abroad have come to join us, causing difficulties in supplies. In the current hot weather, many soldiers are still wearing leather and cotton uniforms, which is extremely miserable. Furthermore, ammunition is scarce, with each soldier averaging less than ten bullets. Therefore, while confronting the enemy across the river, they have sent representatives to Shanghai to appeal to patriotic people from all walks of life, requesting immediate and full support to recover the lost territory in the Northeast. The representatives will return to the battlefield to kill the enemy immediately after negotiations are completed.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigating Team, Including Lytton, to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arrival Expected on the 19th</p>
<p>Sir Victor Lytton, chairman of the League of Nations investigating team, and others are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Japan today on the Japanese postal ship Chichibu Maru. Yesterday, the Shanghai Japanese postal company received a telegram stating that Lytton and the members of the investigating team are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 19th of this month and will disembark at the New Customs Wharf at that time.</p>
<h3>French Water and Electricity Company Employees to Resume Work Today</h3>
<p>General Meeting Resolves to Accept Municipal Government Order</p>
<p>All Terms Awaiting Resolution by Authorities</p>
<p>After the strike by all employees of the mechanical department of the French Water and Electricity Company, the strong attitude of the company made it impossible for party and government agencies to mediate. Yesterday, a general meeting resolved to accept the order of the Municipal Government and resume work today, with all terms awaiting resolution by the authorities.</p>
<p>Water and Electricity Company Statement: The French Water and Electricity Company issued a statement saying that according to reports in various newspapers regarding the strike of the French tram and electricity workers, it seems that various parties are actively engaged in negotiations to mediate. It is hereby declared that this information is absolutely inaccurate. According to Chinese law, this strike is completely illegal, and any mediation is out of the question. The company also knows that both the Chinese and French authorities are fully aware of this.</p>
<p>Direct Labor-Management Consultation: The strike committee of the Second Special District Water and Electricity Industry Union sent representatives Shen Jingyi, Zhang Fubao, Chen Adi, Yu Guixiang, and others to the company at 2:00 PM yesterday. Accompanied by the comprador Yu Jingshan as translator, they met with the superintendent Kuchya and presented their demands, hoping that they would be accepted. The superintendent replied that the company welcomes the workers to return to work and guarantees their safety. The representatives then left at 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Orders Resumption of Work: The Municipal Government accepted the request of French Consul General Méléariat and immediately ordered the French Water and Electricity workers to resume work and await a resolution. Xu Yefu, the third section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, also summoned the union leaders Shen Jingyi and Zhang Fubao to persuade them to consider international relations and local security and resume work immediately, with all terms awaiting resolution by the authorities.</p>
<p>Union Issues Notice: The strike committee of the Second Special District Water and Electricity Industry Union issued a notice to all members yesterday, stating that a general meeting will be held at the Xiaoximen Youth Lecture Group at 2:00 PM on July 13. All members are required to attend on time. It is hereby notified. By 1:00 PM, all employees gathered on Luban Road and marched in formation to the Youth Lecture Group for the meeting. Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Committee and Zhu Lin from the Social Affairs Bureau attended to provide guidance. Later, the Second Division of the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, not having received orders from the headquarters, prohibited the assembly. The representatives of the party and government agencies explained the reasons to the headquarters, and the misunderstanding was resolved. However, all employees had already marched back to the union headquarters to await orders.</p>
<p>General Meeting of All Members: The Municipal Public Security Bureau, having approved the general meeting by the party and government agencies, sent the eighth squadron of the police brigade and police officers from the Second District Police Station, all armed, led by District Chief Zhang Kaitong, to Luban Road to provide protection. The meeting was then announced. The surrounding area was maintained by the picket team and police officers, with strict precautions. Shen Jingyi, Zhang Fubao, Cai Amei, and others were elected as the presidium, and Shen Naiwen recorded the minutes. First, the chairman reported on the negotiations by the party and government agencies and the Municipal Government's order to persuade them to resume work, with all terms to be negotiated with the French consul by the authorities, ensuring a final victory. Subsequently, Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Committee and Zhu Guilin from the Social Affairs Bureau repeatedly urged the workers to trust the government and consider international relations. Therefore, a resolution was passed on the spot that all would accept the order of the Municipal Government and resume work from the 14th, with all terms to be handled by the party and government agencies. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. At the same time, the police brigade withdrew.</p>
<h3>French National Day Today</h3>
<p>Lantern Parade Cancelled Last Night</p>
<p>Military Parade Held This Morning</p>
<p>Today is French National Day. In the past, the French Concession in Shanghai has always had grand celebrations on this day. All institutions and fire stations in the concession competed to decorate with lanterns, and a lantern parade was held on the eve of the holiday along Rue du Consulat and Avenue Joffre, full of dazzling colors. The French authorities originally intended to expand the celebrations as much as possible this time. However, due to the recent labor unrest in Shanghai, there was deep concern that lawless elements might take the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, they temporarily changed their initial plans, and the lantern parade last night was cancelled. However, the military parade in the French Park this morning was still held as usual. However, the park entrance tickets that were traditionally distributed by the French Municipal Council were also cancelled at the same time.</p>

<h3>New Risks Frequently Arising in Dike Work</h3>
<p>Urgent Need to Repair 1,500 Zhang of Engineering</p>
<p>Estimated Cost of Labor and Materials Approximately 600,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Rehabilitation Committee Urgently Cables Government Requesting Appropriation</p>
<p>The members of the Jiangnan Dike Rehabilitation Committee, including Mu Ouchu, believe that the dike works are facing financial difficulties and the consequences are unimaginable. Yesterday, they sent a letter to Chairman Gu and a telegram to Premier Wang of the government, requesting a swift appropriation of funds. The original texts are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Chairman: A letter from Mu Ouchu, a member of the committee, to the chairman of the committee, states: "Chairman Mo San, greetings. We met in Shanghai, and it has been a month since then. I hope you are well and prosperous, and I pray for you. Since the establishment of the Dike Works Association, nearly three months have passed. Fortunately, with your able leadership and the diligence of all colleagues, the project is progressing relatively quickly. If there are no special changes, the projects that have already started should be completed before the big flood. However, after the war in Shanghai, the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted. We previously received a transfer of 700,000 yuan in grain transport bonds, which, after repeated negotiations with banks, only yielded 310,000 yuan in silver dollars. Recently, fortunately, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and the Money Guild have guaranteed 70,000 yuan, leaving a shortage of 20,000 yuan from the originally planned 400,000 yuan. We will try our best to raise enough funds to fulfill our mission. However, the labor and material costs for the projects that have already started, along with various necessary administrative and reserve expenses, cannot be managed without 550,000 yuan. After deducting the 400,000 yuan borrowed, there is still a shortage of 150,000 yuan. The city also has a similar shortage. Although we have repeatedly appealed to the central government, we have not received a single cent of assistance. As for the social aspect, borrowing 400,000 yuan has already required repeated persuasion, and it is still insufficient. It is really impossible to start raising donations from scratch. Considering the government's high expectations and the urgent need for our hometown, I am anxious and unsure what to do. According to reports from the heads of various engineering departments, there are still about 1,500 zhang of engineering that have not yet started but urgently need to be repaired (a detailed list is attached separately). The estimated cost of labor and materials is really 600,000 yuan. After I, along with Committee Member Zhang Xiaoliang and Committee Member Shen Lisun, went to inspect, all the reports were accurate. If we ignore it, repairing here will lead to collapse there, and the state's huge funds will be wasted, and the local hidden worries will remain. If we continue the repair, there will be no funding. I am compelled to join the other members of the committee in sending a telegram to Premier Wang, describing the actual situation and requesting a large appropriation of funds (the telegram has already been published in this newspaper on the 10th and is omitted here). However, the central government's recent financial situation has long been known to us. If empty words are of no help, how can we manage the rehabilitation? I always advocate pragmatism in handling affairs. Since I have witnessed the dangerous situation and am deeply aware of the local economic difficulties and the inability to raise donations, I dare not fail to report the actual situation to you in detail, awaiting your wise guidance. Furthermore, although part of this year's project has been repaired, there are still many places that have not been repaired. The river water has already risen, and the autumn flood will inevitably be severe. Disaster relief equipment must be prepared in advance. The committee's responsibility is rehabilitation, and it has no authority to advise on this annual repair and disaster relief project. I and my colleagues are engaged in commerce and cannot devote ourselves fully to the committee's affairs. I also request that you order the responsible department to make proper preparations to avoid being rushed when the time comes and making mistakes in both areas. I cannot express my respect enough in this letter. I respectfully wish you good health. Mu Xiangyue."</p>

<h3>Cai Tingkai</h3>
<p>Reply to the Anti-War Alliance Telegram</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Anti-War Grand Alliance: I have received your telegram. Ending internal war is the only way to save the country. I express my utmost sympathy. Regarding the Guangdong province's military actions against the Qiongzhou army, a reconciliation has already been reached. I am informing you especially of this. Cai Tingkai bows.</p>
<h3>New County Government Office Begins Construction</h3>
<p>Completion Expected by Year-End, Construction Cost Over 70,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, last year, designated fifty mu of land near the North Bridge Town on North Huiji Road for the construction of a new county government office. Since the January 28th Incident, the construction plan has been suspended indefinitely. Now that order in Shanghai has been restored, the construction of the new office has begun on the previous day. The budget is over 70,000 yuan for construction costs, and it is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The new office will be open on New Year's Day next year. The style of the new office will be modeled after the new city government, and a zoo will be built in front of the county government office.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ming Talks About</h3>
<p>The Patriotic People of Nepal</p>
<p>Last year, in order to strengthen diplomatic relations between China and Nepal, the government specially sent Zhang Dingcheng to Nepal as a representative of the government to award the Grand Marshal of Nepal the rank of General of the Army of the Republic of China and the First Class Baoding Medal. After his mission, he received a grand welcome from the government and people of Nepal. In February of this year, the King of Nepal presented Ambassador Zhang with the Second Class Glorious Precious Star of Nepal. This time, he was summoned back to the country by telegram from Chairman Chiang. Because he passed through tropical areas such as India and Burma, he contracted an illness en route and made a brief stop in Shanghai, so he could not proceed immediately. It is said that Ambassador Zhang once served as Consul-General in India, Java, and other places and is well aware of the national conditions of those countries. This time, he was ordered to go to Nepal, and the people of Nepal deeply appreciated our country's generosity and wished to establish eternal friendship. The reporter found it strange that Nepal was originally a tributary state of our country, and its area is only 500 li and its width is no more than 1,500 li. How can it stand between China and India? According to Ambassador Zhang's findings, he made the following remarks: (1) The people of Nepal are courteous, righteous, and have simple customs and can adhere to the old Eastern morality. (2) The people are hard-working and good at fighting. The country's military preparedness is well-maintained, with a regular army of 100,000 and a reserve army of 200,000. Military equipment and ammunition are sufficient for self-defense. If there is a foreign invasion, the people will rise up to resist the enemy without the need for government mobilization, and the government also values public opinion. With unity from top to bottom, strong neighbors dare not covet it. (3) The people of Nepal hate using foreign goods. All household utensils are domestically produced. Moreover, the country is small and the population is sparse, so it is not subject to the restrictions of tariffs and the constraints of consular jurisdiction. It is completely a free country, which is very different from our country, which has a large land and a large population, but is not as strong as a small country. This really fills me with endless feelings.</p>

<h3>The Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee Takes Responsibility</h3>
<p>Gaoyou Dike Project to Be Completed Soon</p>
<p>The Achievements of Layman Lin Yin Destroying His Family</p>
<p>The Completion Ceremony Will Be Held on a Selected Date</p>
<p>During the severe autumn floods last year, the left bank of the Grand Canal, from the Six Gates of Jiangdu to the Dangjun Bridge of Gaoyou, had 27 breaches. Lakes and rivers merged into one, stretching for more than sixty li. The losses of life and property suffered by the nine counties north of the Yangtze River cannot be enumerated. The Shanghai Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee appealed for donations at home and abroad and engaged in emergency relief, with remarkable results. At that time, the great philanthropist Layman Lin Yin heard of this with compassion, destroyed his family to relieve the disaster, and donated 200,000 yuan to the committee. His heart of relieving the hunger and drowning of others can truly be called the embroidered Buddha of ten thousand families. Later, when the water level of the Grand Canal receded slightly, the Canal Works Rehabilitation Committee sent personnel to block the breaches and cut off the flow at various breaches. The Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee believed that dike repair work could both provide work as relief and fundamentally eliminate future floods, so it resolutely negotiated with the authorities and took responsibility for the dike construction project at the six major breaches in Gaoyou. The budget for the project was over 400,000 yuan. In addition to the 200,000 yuan donated by Layman Lin Yin, there was still a significant shortfall. However, the committee did not worry about it. In addition to actively soliciting donations, it also hired Canal Works Committee member Wang Shuxiang to preside over the engineering work and started work immediately. As of June of this year, four of the six breach projects have been completed in order. The remaining two locations, Dangjun Tower and Miaohangkou, are also imminent. The so-called six breaches are: Dangjun Tower, Miaoxiangkou, Yumatou, Qigongdian, Ershilipu, and Sanshilipu. A summary of the project is recorded below:</p>
<p>Breach Situation: (1) Dangjun Tower has always been a dangerous project, with a breach length of 160 zhang and a depth of about 3 zhang. (2) Miaohangkou has a breach length of 64 zhang and a depth of 1 zhang and 2.5 chi. (3) Yumatou has a breach length of 15 zhang and a depth of 1 zhang and 2.4 chi. (4) Qigongdian has a breach length of 22.5 zhang and a depth of 1 zhang and 1.9 chi. The above four locations are all in the northwest of the city. There are also Ershilipu and Sanshilipu, both in the south of the city. The breach length of Liushilipu is 62 zhang and the depth is over 1 zhang. The breach length of Sanshilipu is 67.5 zhang and the depth is 1 zhang and 2.7 chi. This is a general overview of the measurement of the six breaches.</p>
<p>Project Overview: Except for Ershilipu, the breaches were all brick and stone projects in the past. Last year's breaches caused almost all the bricks and stones to be washed away by the water. The dike restoration project was originally intended to still use bricks and stones or temporarily replace them with concrete. Later, due to the lack of time, it was changed to adding brushwood and straw to the earthwork to increase resistance during this year's autumn floods. Brushwood is soft and elastic. Even if it is impacted by huge waves, it will not be damaged. Using softness to control softness is no less effective than bricks and stones. However, after the start of this construction, it has been particularly difficult to obtain soil. The Dangjun Tower project needs to transport 44,000 square meters of soil. There are dam dikes built on both ends of the canal, and soil boats cannot reach it directly. The nearby fields are flooded and the soil is not suitable for construction, so all the soil required for this project is transported from four or five li away. It takes a lot of effort to build bridges and embankments. There are thousands of soil boats gathered at Dangjun Tower, with three people per boat. Every fifty boats are organized into a team. They recognize their flags and advance and retreat in an orderly manner. There are an average of three to four thousand laborers per day engaged in bailing water, carrying soil, and driving piles, all of whom are local disaster victims. There are also nearly two hundred staff members taking care of the dike work. This only applies to Dangjun Tower. Although the other five locations do not use as much soil or have as many staff members, the difficulties in hiring laborers and obtaining soil are the same as at Dangjun Tower. The modification methods for the six breaches are listed below: (Dangjun Tower) The length of the project is 167 zhang. The width of the top of the straw and soil is 4 zhang. The height is 2 zhang and 2.9 chi. The new slope has three contractions. The height of the straw is 2 zhang and 0.8 chi. The face soil is 8 cun thick, level with the top of the soil. The straw does not fill the pond. The inside and outside have three contractions. (Miaohangkou) The length of the project is 64 zhang. The width of the top of the straw and soil is 4 zhang. The height of the sac is 2 zhang and 1.5 chi. The new slope has three contractions. The height of the straw is 1 zhang and 7.6 chi. The face soil is 8 cun thick, level with the top of the soil. The straw is filled to a height of 4 chi at the bottom, with two contractions on one side. (Yumatou) The length of the project is 15 zhang. The width of the new top is 3 zhang. The length of the fur is 1 zhang and 6.2 chi. The new slope has three contractions. The outside height is 1 zhang and 7.5 chi. The new slope has two contractions. (Qigongdian) The length of the project is 22.5 zhang. The width of the top of the straw and soil is 4 zhang. The inside height is 1 zhang and 6 cun. The new slope has three contractions. The height of the straw is 1 zhang and 6.7 chi. The face soil is 8 cun thick, level with the top of the soil. (Ershilipu) The length of the project is 62 zhang. The width of the new top is 3 zhang. The inside height is 2 zhang and 2.4 chi. The new slope has three contractions. The outside height is 1 zhang and 8.1 chi. The new slope has two contractions, level with both ends. (Sanshilipu) The length of the project is 67.5 zhang. The total width of the straw work is 4 zhang. The inside height is 2 zhang and 5.2 chi. The new slope has three contractions. The inside height is 1 zhang and 6 chi. The face soil is 8 cun thick, level with the top of the soil. Currently, four of the above six dike projects have been completed according to the above measurements (Sanshilipu, Liushilipu, Qigongdian, Yumatou). The Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee is also responsible for the 853.7 zhang of flat work near the six breaches, including helping to raise, reinforce, and fill the gaps. This project has also been completed. Although this type of dike construction uses soil as a raw material, purely using soil to build up the dikes, with such great height and depth, and such a wide length, new soil and new work are difficult to consolidate. Therefore, pilings have been added to places such as Dangjun Tower, Miaoxiangkou, Sanshilipu, and Qigongdian. The names of the pilings are Guant, Guansao, and Qiansao. Approximately 4,000 pilings have been used in the four breaches, with lengths ranging from 2 zhang and 4 chi to over 3 zhang. Like the human body, soil is the muscle, and wooden piles are the skeleton.</p>
<p>Money Is Not Wasted: The original budget for the six breach projects was over 400,000 yuan, but based on current calculations, less than 400,000 yuan will be enough. This is due to the cheap price of soil and the integrity of the engineering staff. According to the desire for good engineering, personal supervision is necessary. Therefore, the six breach projects were presided over by Wang Shuxiang, who personally supervised the work day and night, so that the goal of not wasting money and returning the work to reality could be achieved. The Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee is naturally employing the right person, and Layman Lin Yin, who destroyed his family to relieve the disaster, must also be happy and deeply grateful that the six breaches will soon be fully completed, returning our entire dike and protecting northern Jiangsu. It is heard that the committee plans to send personnel to hold a completion ceremony at that time and invite the Jiangsu Provincial Government to inspect and accept the project.</p>
<h3>Department Telegram</h3>
<p>Resolving the Wenzhou-Chuzhou Salt Affairs Dispute</p>
<p>The people of Wenzhou and Chuzhou oppose the contractor system. Those in Shanghai have organized an improvement association, and Yongshou and other Frenchmen have also jointly organized an improvement association, actively petitioning. The Transportation Envoy has forwarded it to the office. The Transport Office received a telegram from the Department the other day, which is transcribed as follows: Zhou Transport Envoy, please read. Salt New Secret. The Transportation Envoy's No. 210 submission and attachments have been received. The contractor Wang Yongshan in Wenzhou and Chuzhou has been repeatedly accused. According to the Transportation Envoy's investigation and submission, the contractor has not handled the matter perfectly and cannot satisfy the local people. For the sake of fundamental rectification, the only option is to take it back and run it officially, and still follow the previous open method, so that anyone can pay taxes and transport salt. This should be approved. However, during the transition of taking it back and running it officially, there are urgent matters to be prepared. For example, whether Wang Yongshan has owed any taxes since he took office, and whether there are any unfulfilled permits and unsold salt, the Transportation Envoy should quickly investigate and clarify. If there are any unpaid taxes, they should be immediately recovered. Unfulfilled permits and unsold salt should be investigated and dealt with in accordance with Article 7 of the Wenzhou-Chuzhou Recognized Merchant Regulations. As for the various fees collected by Wang Yongshan in the salt price during his tenure, the Transportation Envoy should follow the instructions of the Salt Affairs Bureau of this Department, Renzi No. 831, and investigate thoroughly and demand payment within a time limit. The merchant patrol equipment and clothing purchased by Wang Yongshan were paid for by the recognized merchant from the patrol subsidy collected from the salt price, which was originally borne by the people and not purchased by the merchant himself. They should be ordered to hand over all of them to the public for inventory, without giving any compensation. Furthermore, according to the Transportation Envoy's previous telegrams, the salt reserves in Wenzhou and Chuzhou were exhausted early, and no Min salt was imported. Please allow the borrowing of 100,000 Jin of Huai salt to alleviate the salt shortage. After the cancellation of the Wenzhou-Chuzhou contractor, whether the salt reserves produced in various salt fields in Wenzhou and Chuzhou can meet the needs of free sales after opening, and if they are insufficient, how should they be supplied? If it is necessary to borrow from other areas, how should it be handled to ensure accurate transportation and sales? The Transportation Envoy should investigate and clarify these matters together and propose a solution quickly. If there are other matters that need to be prepared, the Transportation Envoy should carefully plan and submit them for review and handling. In short, the Wenzhou-Chuzhou contractor has not been managed well and should be revoked, but national taxes and people's food must be taken into account. We must speed up preparations and carry out the work earnestly, so as to achieve rectification as soon as possible. Please comply and report the handling situation to be checked as needed. Ministry of Finance, slight seal.</p>
<p>The Problem of Abolishing the Tael and Changing to the Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published a certain gentleman's remarks on abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan, discussing customs duties, foreign exchange, domestic remittances, debts, claims, national currency, and banknotes. The words were concise and insightful, providing excellent material for researchers. However, abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan is a major event. Many people in the country advocate making a decisive decision and proceeding quickly, but there are also those who advocate careful consideration and advance planning for various methods of dealing with the aftermath. This newspaper will further disclose the opinions of those who advocate caution, as follows:</p>
<p>The gentleman whose opinions are published today is a financial giant in Shanghai, who has been engaged in business in Shanghai for decades. He has also served in the current firm for more than ten years. He is knowledgeable about financial affairs and often makes accurate predictions. His words may be used as a source of inspiration for others. The gentleman said:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan, those who advocate a positive approach are indeed urging its success, and those who advocate a negative approach need not oppose it. Consider this a matter of fact, but the key is to ensure that there are sufficient funds after the change to the yuan, so as not to directly shake the finances and indirectly disrupt commerce. As for what we think should be paid attention to, let us try to speak about it, knowing that we will be blamed, but not caring.</p>
<p>Shanghai is currently a market that uses silver (the reporter notes that this is the so-called silver terminal), not only for money shops, which mostly use silver as the standard, but also for all domestic remittances, which are mostly converted in silver taels. Moreover, foreign trade mainly uses silver taels, and foreign banks are even engaged in collecting and storing silver as reserves. Therefore, although silver dollars are used in market transactions, silver taels are used in commerce, remittances, and foreign trade. Furthermore, Shanghai is a terminal where cash is received and delivered daily. When receiving and delivering, silver taels are always used. Therefore, the power of silver taels in the market can be imagined. Now that the tael is abolished and changed to the yuan, the financial industry has important relationships with customers and in mutual settlements, which should be paid attention to. However, domestic and foreign remittances can be calculated at the legal price, which may not be a problem.</p>
<p>As for customers, in the current financial industry, there are many foreign accounts and also many silver accounts. As Shanghai has always been a silver terminal, depositors who deposit silver taels must also be paid in silver taels when they withdraw. Now that the tael is abolished and changed to the yuan, silver dollars will naturally be given according to regulations. Furthermore, mutual settlements originally used silver, but now that the yuan has been changed, silver dollars should also be used for mutual settlements.</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghai was a silver terminal, and the national currency, silver dollars, has always been insufficient (the reporter notes that the current Shanghai market claims to have 200 million silver dollars, but in fact it may be no more than 150 to 160 million taels). The hard currency that is currently circulating actually contains less than seven qian of pure silver, but it is used as a representative of a market price of over seven qian (the price fluctuates and is called yangli). Moreover, due to the inevitable phenomenon of bad money driving out good money, provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Hubei, and other provinces, as well as Yuan dollars, are now being melted down into silver, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan per day (the reporter notes that melting down Guangdong dollars and Yuan dollars into silver, calculated at the current yangli, can yield nearly 200 taels of profit per 10,000 yuan). As a result, the hard currency circulating in the market is actually below its legal representative price. If the tael is abolished and changed to the yuan and these silver dollars are used as the exchange product for abolishing the tael, will silver depositors not suffer losses? This is the first thing that needs special attention.</p>
<p>It is well known that there is currently an insufficient supply of hard currency. After the abolishment of the tael, in order to alleviate the shortage of hard currency, banknotes will inevitably be used. However, China has been issuing banknotes for decades, such as the official money notes of Hubei and the Feng banknotes of the three northeastern provinces. Occasionally, due to incidents, they have either been cancelled in form or fallen to unimaginable levels. People who hold banknotes have suffered incalculable losses. Now, feeling the insufficient supply of hard currency and using banknotes, it will inevitably increase the amount of banknotes issued. In normal times, the circulation of banknotes is fine, but if there is a slight incident and a storm arises, the credibility of banknotes will inevitably become a problem again. In the past, with silver taels and silver dollars coexisting, and silver taels being the mainstay of market circulation, and with silver stored in reserves, it was still enough to use silver taels to settle the shortage of silver dollars. Now that the yuan has been changed, if the yuan is insufficient, even if banknotes are used, the credibility of banknotes will be a problem, and the market turmoil will be even greater.</p>
<p>For the current plan, the first thing to pay attention to when abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan is silver dollars. In short, it should be divided into two points:</p>
<p>(1) The fineness of silver dollars. The amount of pure silver contained in silver dollars should be equal to the value it represents and should not be reduced in the slightest. As for the legal price regulations, the government has the right to weigh them and formulate them based on the content. For example, if the amount of pure silver contained in each silver dollar is six qian and eight fen, then when the tael is abolished, the legal price of each yuan should not be higher than six qian and eight fen. If the legal price matches the pure silver, then when the tael is abolished and changed to the yuan, silver depositors will not lose money.</p>
<p>(2) Adding the minting of hard currency. There is currently an insufficient supply of hard currency for circulation, which is inconvenient once the tael is abolished. Therefore, the government should immediately add the minting of hard currency to ensure a steady supply that is sufficient for circulation in the national market, without having to wait for banknotes. If hard currency is sufficient and the fineness is uniform, then there will be enough cash for exchange, and silver taels can be cancelled without any problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, minting hard currency cannot be done quickly enough, so banknotes must be used temporarily. There should also be stricter regulations for banknotes:</p>
<p>(1) Issuing a fixed amount. Banks that issue banknotes today have a fixed amount, and the total amount issued rises and falls with the amount of circulation. Once the tael is abolished, the demand for banknotes will increase greatly, and those with the right to issue banknotes will inevitably increase the issuance due to the increase in demand. However, if the increase is too much and the amount is not fixed, even if the credit is good, how can everyone know about it? It is best for each bank to measure its own ability and set a total issuance amount. No matter what, the issuance should not exceed this amount. Then society will know that the bank's strength is sufficient to bear the burden, and its issuance credit will increase and its circulation will be smoother.</p>
<p>(2) Strict inspection. Today, those who issue banknotes have mostly implemented an inspection system. In the future, after the tael is abolished, the circulation of banknotes will be of great importance to the whole country. An extremely open and strict inspection should be carried out, and those responsible for the inspection should especially know that the people's livelihood and the country's destiny depend on it. They must not be afraid of hard work or show favoritism. All reserves of cash and securities should be personally checked one by one to show great credibility. Then the credit of banknotes will increase and the power of circulation will expand.</p>
<p>In short, to abolish the tael and change to the yuan, there must first be sufficient preparation and advance planning so that after the system is changed, the people will not have the slightest inconvenience or loss and there will be no further disputes. This is what the people hope for and what the financial industry should be responsible for. We hope to encourage each other with the people of the country to achieve success and offer our blessings.</p>

<h3>Guo Luman</h3>
<p>Marriage Dispute Case</p>
<p>Divided into Three Major Parts</p>
<p>To be Tried by Three Judges</p>
<p>Identity Case Suspended</p>
<p>Awaiting Public Prosecution Verdict for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Guo Luman, a native of Ningbo who owns a substantial amount of real estate and is past his prime, has a wife, Han Yueling, who has borne him three daughters. The eldest has already married out, and the youngest is also fifteen years old. Unexpectedly, Guo, on May 29th of this year, falsely claimed to have divorced Han and formally married Xu Zhiqing, a female painter from the City Temple, thus committing the crime of bigamy. Han not only requested the police to initiate a public prosecution against Guo but also retained lawyers Yang Linzhi and Zhang Jiahui to file a private prosecution against Xu Zhiqing for knowingly marrying a married man. Xu's uncle, Xu Guanchen, and the matchmakers Lian Jiming and Xing Chunhua, were also accused of aiding bigamy. Guo Luman, on the other hand, filed a civil suit against Han Yueling, claiming that Han's status as his wife had been extinguished by the divorce papers he had drawn up, and requested confirmation of his identity. Xu Zhiqing then also retained lawyer Chen Tingrui to sue Guo for fraudulent marriage, involving Han's younger sisters Qian Hu Miaosheng and Han Meisheng. All of these cases are interconnected. The First Special District Local Court scheduled hearings yesterday, morning and afternoon, to try them separately.</p>
<p>Identity Confirmation Case: At 10:30 AM, Judge Qiao Wanxuan of the Seventh Tribunal first opened the hearing for Guo's case against Han for confirmation of identity. The original plaintiffs and defendants, along with their respective lawyers, reported on time. In addition, many female relatives of both parties were in court to observe. According to the plaintiff, Guo Luman, his marriage to Han was arranged by his parents, but between the tenth and eleventh years of the Republic (1921-1922), he had already drawn up a divorce agreement and published a statement in the newspaper. The divorce papers and newspapers were kept in an iron box, which was taken away by Han. If that evidence is needed, Han should be ordered to hand over the box, etc. Guo's lawyer, Wu Chengyu, then presented a draft letter, stating that this letter was to Guo's father, Yonglan, inquiring whether his son had divorce papers. Although no written reply was received, someone was sent to inquire, and it was claimed that it was indeed the case, but unfortunately, Guo's father was unwilling to testify. Then, the judge questioned Guo and Han, who stated that she had never been divorced by Guo, and there were no so-called divorce papers. Han's lawyer, Yang Linzhi, then cited the Civil Procedure Law, requesting that the case be suspended, stating that because another criminal case was in progress, this case should be temporarily suspended until the criminal proceedings were concluded. This is a procedural issue of great importance, and a ruling is requested first. Guo's lawyer, on the other hand, opposed, saying that the criminal suit should be suspended first, and the criminal suit should be heard after the verdict in this identity suit. After consideration by Judge Qiao, he ruled in court that the civil suit should be suspended pending the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. He adjourned the court, and the clock struck eleven.</p>
<p>Police Prosecution Case: After fifteen minutes, the police's public prosecution of Guo Luman for bigamy and Guo and Han's private prosecution of Xu Zhiqing, Xu Guanchen, Lian Jiming, Xing Chunhua, and others for complicity in the marriage were heard by Judge Feng Shide in the First Criminal Tribunal. Thereupon, everyone involved in the case, including lawyers and relatives of both parties, moved from the Seventh Tribunal to the First Tribunal. This court was larger, and the audience was even larger, but most were women. However, the defendant Xu Guanchen and the two matchmakers did not appear in court. According to Xu Zhiqing, her uncle, Guanchen, was ill with anger because he was accused, so it was difficult for him to appear in court. As for the two matchmakers, they were not present because they had left Shanghai. The prosecuting lawyer for the police, Ru Baoyi, first stated that the defendant in the public prosecution was only Guo Luman. The remaining defendants were all privately prosecuted by Guo and Han. These two cases were interconnected. Whether they should be tried together should be considered. Judge Feng then announced that for the convenience of the trial, it was appropriate to try them together, but the public prosecution should not be confused with the private prosecution, so separate verdicts would still be given in the future. The lawyers for each side had no objection to this approach, and the interrogation began immediately. First, Guo Luman was asked if he had found any evidence. Guo's testimony was the same as in the civil court, still claiming that the evidence was hidden in the iron box, and requesting that the case be postponed again to continue searching for evidence. Guo's lawyer also presented the letter to Guo Yonglan, requesting that he be summoned to testify, but all were strongly refuted by the police lawyer, who stated that Guo had said that he had divorced Han, but had not produced any evidence, which was obviously empty talk. Moreover, Guo Yonglan had already published a statement in the newspaper that he was not responsible for his son's bigamy, which showed that there were no divorce papers. In short, the defendant's bigamy was undoubtedly the case. The civil court had suspended the identity suit, awaiting the conclusion of this case before reopening the hearing, so if the defendant's request for postponement was granted, it would not be approved. Judge Feng then questioned Guo and Han, who stated that there were no divorce papers in the iron box. The box had two keys, one for me and one for the defendant. Before the lawsuit, the defendant would often open the box, but after the lawsuit, he had never opened it. She also recounted the details of her private prosecution against Xu Zhiqing and others. The defendant Xu Zhiqing stated that she was twenty-seven years old. On December 24th of the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925), she was engaged to Guo Luman through Lian Jiming and Zhou, the mother of Xing Chunhua. At that time, Guo was living in the Jian De Hui dormitory, and the matchmaker said that Guo's wife was dead and that he was remarried. The following year, when she learned that Guo had a wife, she wanted to dissolve the engagement, but the matchmaker said that Guo had divorced Han. I didn't believe it in the end. Later, Jin Defu showed me Guo's handwritten letter, which said that he had broken off relations with Han. However, after this twist and turn, both parties put this matter aside for seven years. People and in March of this year Zhou of Xing suddenly the younger brother of Hu, Han Meisheng and Hu Miaosheng together to my house, and spoke of the wedding again.</p>
<p>Hu also stated that Guo had already divorced Han, and the family property had also been divided equally between Guo and Han. Guo was determined to marry her. If I still didn't believe it, I could ask a lawyer to testify or have both parents publish a statement in the newspaper. So on May 29th, we got married at the Yangbu Public Office. How could I know that it was all a deception they designed? Her lawyer, Chen Tingrui, presented the wedding advertisement as evidence. Questioning Guo Luman, he said that this was actually a trap set by Han to induce me to do it myself. I have not lived with her for ten years. She was resentful and designed to frame me. When I got engaged to Xu, although I said that I had broken off relations with Han, the woman did not believe me, so the matter was put aside for several years. I had no hope of marrying Xu. Last spring, Han asked me about this, saying why haven't you married her yet? I said I had no money. She immediately ordered her younger brother, Meisheng, to borrow 4,000 yuan from her brother-in-law, Hu Miaosheng, to pay the woman's family as betrothal gifts. At the same time, she accompanied me to rent a house in Gaoshou Lane to use as our new home. Han was also present on the day of the wedding. I heard that her initial plan was to wait for the betrothal gifts to arrive at the door and buy a large number of hooligans to cause trouble so that the police could intervene, and then take the opportunity to accuse me of bigamy. Fortunately, this plan was seen through by my eldest son-in-law, who called Han away beforehand, so fortunately, nothing happened that day, etc. However, Han denied this testimony. Judge Feng inquired until noon and then adjourned the hearing to continue on the morning of the 22nd. Guo Luman was still released on bail of 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Private Prosecution for Fraudulent Marriage: At 2:30 PM, Judge Wu Tingqi took the bench in the Second Criminal Tribunal to hear Xu Zhiqing's private prosecution against Guo Luman and others for fraudulent marriage. The plaintiff, Xu Zhiqing, first recounted the details of Han Meisheng and Hu Miaosheng's coming to discuss the marriage, which was roughly the same as what she said in the morning. Her lawyer, Chen Tingrui, further added that this case was actually created by Han. Han Meisheng and others are her younger brothers. The plaintiff believed them, thinking that Han had indeed broken off relations with Guo, and then decided to marry him. Guo Luman then stated that Han and Hu's visit to discuss the marriage was actually done by Han, and at that time, I was still in Hangzhou, etc. Questioning Han, she denied the statements of Xu and Guo. Han Meisheng and Hu Miaosheng both claimed that they did not go to Xu's house to discuss the marriage. Then, lawyer Chen presented the thin receipt for sending the letter and the matchmaker's wedding invitation, proving that Han and Hu had indeed known about it. Guo Luman also stated that the letter presented by lawyer Chen was indeed written by Hu. Hu also had the name Xian Zhang, so the note was signed with the name Xian Zhang, etc. Zheng Ruosun, the second landlord of the house rented by Guo in Gaoshou Lane, proved that Guo and Han came to rent the house together. Judge Wu then adjourned the case to be scheduled after the verdict in the divisible portion.</p>
<h3>Murder for Property Case in Pudong</h3>
<p>Two Perpetrators Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Zhang (surname Zhang) Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhang Linsen, a deceased racehorse leader in Huayuanshi Bridge, Pudong, had three wives and concubines. After Zhang and his first wife, Zhang Qian, passed away, they left behind property. Disputes arose over the uneven distribution between the legitimate and illegitimate sides. Zhang Qingxiang, the son of Zhang (surname Zhang), the third concubine, colluded with his maternal uncle, Zhang Quansheng, nicknamed "Beef Quansheng," to murder Linsen's eldest son, Guoxiang, and second son, Yuxiang. However, Yuxiang was shot and killed, while Guoxiang was injured but not killed. This case was thoroughly investigated by the prosecutor of the Local Court, who prosecuted Zhang Qingxiang and Zhang Quansheng for premeditated murder, and Zhang (surname Zhang) for joint murder. Judge Shen Youqi of the Criminal Tribunal repeatedly opened hearings to investigate and extensively consulted public opinion. After tireless research, he announced the end of the debate a few days ago. Zhang Guoxiang and Zhang Bao, the wife of Zhang Yuxiang, both filed private suits for compensation for damages. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen opened a hearing and brought Zhang Qingxiang, Zhang Quansheng, and Zhang (surname Zhang) to the case to announce the judgment. Zhang Qingxiang and Zhang Quansheng were both sentenced to death for jointly premeditating murder and deprived of their civil rights indefinitely. Zhang (surname Zhang) was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for joint murder. The defendants were jointly and severally liable to compensate Zhang Bao for 5,352 yuan for living expenses and 400 yuan for funeral expenses, and to compensate Zhang Guoxiang for 280 yuan for medical expenses and 500 yuan for consolation money. However, Zhang (surname Zhang) was temporarily released on bail during the appeal period, while Zhang Qingxiang and Zhang Quansheng were strictly guarded and shackled in the detention center.</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Society</h3>
<p>Releases the Evils of Opium Monopoly</p>
<p>The rumor of opium monopoly has been rampant recently. The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society is very concerned and has continued to resist. The society yesterday released the disastrous situation of opium monopoly in various colonial areas in Southeast Asia to arouse the attention of the people of the country. The general idea is that today, countries that implement opium monopoly are only in colonies, including Japan in Taiwan and the Kwantung Leased Territory, Britain in Hong Kong, the Straits Settlements, the Malay Peninsula, etc., the Netherlands in the East Indies, Portugal in Macau, and France in Annam. Except for Annam, the society has sent personnel to investigate all the above places. The actual situation can be summarized in a few words. Japan [Opium monopoly is only collecting taxes without prohibition.] The government protects illegal murderous businesses with laws, encourages people to commit suicide and murder with the government's power, and collects profits from it. The victims are overseas Chinese and indigenous people. Now let's give a few examples to prove the evils of opium monopoly: (1) My country is known as the "country of opium." According to the society's estimate, the people who smoke opium account for 5% of the total population, at most no more than 10%. In the Straits Settlements of British Malaya, the number of overseas Chinese reaches 20% to 30%. This proves that opium monopoly will increase the number of opium smokers. (2) The opium prohibition in Taiwan is praised by those who advocate monopoly in my country and try to get the government to follow suit according to law. However, the results of opium prohibition over the past 30 years are ridiculous. In 1897, there were 50,597 opium smokers. By 1930, these 50,000 opium smokers should have died out due to age. Unexpectedly, in the same year, a new registration was made, and there were still more than 26,000 public smokers and more than 25,000 private smokers, totaling more than 2,000 additional people. And those not included in the statistics are not included. This shows that opium monopoly cannot reduce the number of opium smokers. (3) The total number of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia is only more than 5 million. In 1928, the governments of British, French, and Dutch colonies imported 7,487 boxes of Indian and Persian opium for monopoly use, totaling 19,068,320 taels. If it is believed that opium monopoly is a scientific opium prohibition method, then the above places, which have been implementing monopoly for 20 to 30 years, still need more than 20 million taels of opium to supply the more than 5 million overseas Chinese people. In addition to expanding opium sales, what are the results of opium prohibition? (4) According to reliable statistics from the Singapore government, only 17% of the overseas Chinese who smoke opium brought their addiction from their home country, and 83% became addicted after arriving in the local area. This proves that the environment created by opium monopoly not only cannot make them quit opium, but actually drives people to become addicted. (5) In 1928, the Straits Settlements of British Malaya seized 3.2 million taels of opium smuggled by illegal immigrants. This shows that government monopoly cannot eliminate smuggling. (6) According to the report of the Malayan Opium Investigation Committee in 1924, almost all Chinese coolies smoke opium. These opium smokers live a life worse than cattle and horses, and spend more than 60% of their income on opium. These overseas Chinese are mostly trapped by opium addiction and cannot return to their home country for the rest of their lives in a foreign land. If we cite the above facts, we can see that the success of the opium monopoly policy lies in the money exchanged for the blood and sweat of poor, ignorant people. (7) The above examples are mostly from colonies where the government monopolies opium. The evils are so great. Even in my country, the former Opium Prohibition and Investigation Office and the official-merchant joint-stock monopoly organized by some people today will be even more unbearable. The above simple examples can show the harm of opium monopoly. Instead of calling it a scientific opium prohibition method, it is better to call it a scientific poisoning method. If we look at it from a scientific perspective, its results and effects are completely contrary to opium prohibition. Opium monopoly is a method of imperialist oppression of weak nations. If we recognize this as a scientific value, then we will be deceiving ourselves. If we recognize this as a good law and beautiful intention, it is actually neither good nor beautiful. Today, opium addiction is rampant in our country, there is no need to hide it. If the government has no determination to prohibit opium, how can we expect results? If the government is sincere, it should speak and act, and start with what it can do. For example, in Jiangbei, which is close to the capital, and Henan, where the acting capital is located, opium seedlings are everywhere. The special tax office of the two lakes, which violates the law, continues to exist. All kinds of things are enough to show that the authorities have no intention of prohibiting opium. It is not that opium cannot be prohibited. The current opium prohibition laws in our country are already very complete. The 44 motions passed by the first national opium prohibition conference are also very thorough. What is needed is only the determination and courage of the government authorities to earnestly implement them. Today, some people say that there is no way to prohibit opium, which is a big mistake. Today, it is not that there is no way, but that there are no people who abide by and enforce the law. The society's opposition to monopoly and supervision of opium prohibition is an unwavering and unchangeable principle. At this time of lax opium prohibition, we should work harder to follow the people of the country and fight to the end against the evil system of monopoly.</p>
<h3>Border Crossing Road Construction Case Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced yesterday that the Municipal Council Board of Directors had not discussed the method of border crossing roads today. However, Chairman Bell reported at the meeting that although Dr. Feixindun was ill, he had explained to a representative of the Municipal Government the points that the Municipal Council wanted to clarify in detail and discussed the textual revisions with him.</p>
<h3>Songjiang District</h3>
<p>Decision to Increase Salt Tax Rate</p>
<p>Shanghai Concession Increases by One Yuan Four Jiao Five Per Shi</p>
<p>Five Grades of High and Low Increase by One Jiao for Two Yuan Seven</p>
<p>Song District Can Earn Additional 500,000 After Tax Increase</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Finance Minister Song Ziwen has reorganized the salt tax and proposed a temporary tax rate for the reorganization of salt tax in the producing area. It has been passed by the Central Political Conference, and the Ministry of Finance has begun to implement it. The first phase of the reorganization area is the five districts of Liangzhe Songjiang, Huainan, Huaibei, and Changlu. Shanghai belongs to the Songjiang district, so yesterday the reporter specially visited the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy's Office to inquire, and the details obtained are as follows:</p>
<p>Song District Salt Administration: The Songjiang Transport Envoy governs the five prefectures of Su, Chang, Zhen, Tai, and Song. The Song prefecture includes Chuannan, Bao, and the concession. In the past, the salt tax rate varied from high to low. After the audit office rectified it, in terms of the Song district, the tax per shi was 2.7 yuan in 18 counties and 3.2 yuan in 6 counties. However, the salt tax rate in Songjiang remained the same, with five grades of 3.2, 2.7, 1.5, and 1.6 yuan. The entire district produces and sells 3 million shi annually, and the concession produces 200,000 shi. The total annual income is about 4-5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Concession Tax Increase: The office has received instructions to increase the salt tax in the Shanghai concession. The original tax per shi was 1.5 yuan, and now the tax will be increased by 1.45 yuan, including all miscellaneous taxes, totaling 4.5 yuan per shi of salt produced. The Su and Chang prefectures in the Song district will not be increased, and the salt tax in Zhen and Tai will not be increased for those at 3.2 yuan, and will be increased by 1 jiao for those at 2.7 yuan. Chuannan Jiandi in the Song prefecture and Baoshan Jie will also be increased by 1 jiao for 19 liang diagrams. The rest will be increased by more than 1 yuan, but the number is not large.</p>
<p>Increased Amount: After the Song district implements the tax increase this time, the concession area, calculated at half a yuan per shi, can increase revenue by 300,000 yuan. The remaining prefectures, with some increasing and some not, can increase by about 200,000 yuan. These 50 million yuan are part of the 6 million yuan directly increased by the Ministry of Finance after this reorganization.</p>
<p>Implementation of Collection: The office has been ordered to actively proceed. Yesterday, it issued a notice to the collection agencies under its jurisdiction and discussed the collection methods with the Salt Affairs Audit Branch. The implementation date is said to be undetermined, but it is likely that the collection will be based on the increased amount starting next month.</p>
<h3>Ministry and Provincial Governments Compete to Collect Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Advocates Tax Payment Temporarily Deposited in Bank</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Local Yellow Wine Industry Association inquiring about the tobacco and alcohol license tax, which is collected by the Ministry and provincial governments separately. Which is the formal agency? Please investigate and instruct so that we can follow, etc. The association immediately replied, "The association has submitted this matter to the Ministry of Finance, inquiring about how to deal with the fact that the Jiangsu Province has established a bureau to collect taxes without the approval of the Ministry. At the same time, we have also notified the third district tobacco and alcohol license tax sub-bureau of Jiangsu Province that this case is currently being submitted to the Ministry for instructions. Before the Ministry's approval, it is not convenient to advise tobacco and alcohol merchants to change to the provincial bureau for tax collection. Your industry's tax payment continues to be paid to the Ministry in accordance with the procedures and does not violate the law. If you are worried about the entanglement between the bureau and the province, then follow the method of the Liang Shaoyu industry and deposit the tax payment in the Bank of China and send a letter to the two sub-bureaus of the Ministry and the province. This matter is to wait for the Ministry's instructions to determine which direction it belongs to before complying. The above two methods can be considered and implemented by your association," etc.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau</h3>
<p>Deadline for Changing Land Certificates</p>
<p>Order to Inform All Households in Map 1 Land Ziwei in Huning District</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau announced yesterday, "For the purpose of announcement, after investigating the old 25th Bao Fourth Map in the Huning District, it has now been reorganized into Map 1 Land Ziwei in the Huning District. Since the land certificates of each household in the Wei began to be exchanged on September 16th of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), most of the property owners have complied with the payment of single strings to collect the land certificates. However, there are still some who have delayed collecting the drawings. According to the 14th article of the bureau's rules for issuing land practice certificates, it should have been reported to the Municipal Government for punishment. Considering that the property owners are scattered in all directions, the previous announcement may not have been fully informed. The Municipal Government has previously approved an extension of one year, and it has been more than a year. According to the case, the land of all households that have not exchanged certificates will be publicly auctioned or taken over by the city. However, the city suffered from war before, and transportation was inconvenient, resulting in exceeding the extended deadline. Now, in particular, a concession is given. Starting from the date of this announcement, the deadline is within three months to collect the property ownership certificate and go to the bureau to exchange the certificate. If there is any further delay, a punishment will be given," etc.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Promises</h3>
<p>Free Clean Water to Help Poor People Prevent Epidemics</p>
<p>Yesterday (Wednesday), the Municipal Council Board of Directors approved the recommendation of the Health Committee. In order to assist in preventing cholera, the public concession water company was specially authorized to make concessions on the water price contract, so that some clean water could be provided free of charge to poor residents. The water company also sent a letter to the Municipal Council, promising to supply residents without water pipes on the road's fire hydrants as usual, and there would be no time limit. At the same time, the Health Department also investigated and gave water at several locations, all of which were areas where cholera was more severe. It was found that this matter had been suggested by the publicity team of the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Conference, and the director of the fire brigade had drafted several methods. However, according to the director of the Health Department, free supply of clean water cannot completely prevent the spread of water, because there are still many wells everywhere, although disinfection has been carried out, but it is impossible to prevent washing vegetables and rice with river water and pond water. Also, there is no formal ratio between cholera statistics and unclean beverages, and residents' drinking water, those who do not get from tap water and artesian wells, are also less than 10%. Therefore, the director of the Health Department suggested that the free water supply can be approved in principle, but its implementation method and supply amount need to be carefully drafted. This idea was approved by the Health Committee, but if the expenditure is increased as a result, it must be submitted to the committee and the Board of Directors again. This recommendation was approved by the Board of Directors. The publicity team of the Epidemic Prevention Conference also suggested purchasing a cheap film projector to promote epidemic prevention, but because there is no concrete plan, the Health Committee decided to postpone it.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Procedures for Selling Public Land</p>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Council's sale of the remaining land at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, some newspapers have criticized its procedures. The Public Works Committee discussed this section on the 8th of this month and believed that the criticism was unreasonable. However, it is necessary to stipulate these procedures in principle. Therefore, a committee member suggested that in the future, the sale of remaining land should be advertised, and bids should be received for two months, so that buyers can discuss with their headquarters. Also, if valuable land is sold, in addition to publishing an announcement in the Gazette, advertisements should be published separately in the newspaper to ensure that everyone knows. This proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<h3>Tangqiao, Pudong</h3>
<p>The Bao Wei Tuan Kills Jiang Guohua</p>
<p>At about 8 pm the night before, the local Bao Wei Tuan member killed a person resembling an imposter cop in Tangqiao Zhen. Here is the record of the investigation:</p>
<p>Bing Gun Stop: At 8:45 pm the night before, there were four men wearing mismatched clothes walking around Chenjiazhai, south of Wangjiazhai in Tangqiao Zhen, Pudong. Yang, the platoon leader of the 2nd platoon of the Tangshu District Bao Wei Tuan, saw that these people looked suspicious and immediately led a few members to stop these four men. He questioned them about the password and searched them one by one. The first three people had no prohibited items. Unexpectedly, one of the people in the back suddenly put both hands in his pocket and pulled out a box gun. Yang saw that the situation was not good and immediately opened the pistol and shot the person. Two shots hit the right shoulder, and the bullet penetrated backward. One bullet hit the left waist and did not penetrate. He fell to the ground and died on the spot. The other three took the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>Willing Police Symbol: The deceased was wearing an outer robe of Chao blue cloth trousers, an inner white short shirt, yellow cloth shorts, yellow cloth leggings, black socks, and Zhigong cloth shoes. Yang searched the deceased's body on the spot and found a row of bullets and a symbol of a volunteer police officer named Jiang Guohua in a certain district. The 3rd sub-office of the Public Security Bureau 3rd District, took them back to the office for verification, and Yang took back a box gun to the regiment headquarters. The situation was reported to the superiors for verification.</p>
<p>Wife's Sad Complaint: Yesterday, Dong, the director of the 3rd sub-office of the 3rd District, ordered the local Bao Zhu Gongsheng to petition the Local Court. At 5 pm, Prosecutor Yang was commissioned, along with his staff, to come to the scene to inspect. The examiner found that the deceased had been shot and killed. The body was handed over to the family for coffin collection. Then, according to the wife of the deceased, Chang, her husband's name was Jiang Guohua, from Shandong. She also stated the situation of being shot and killed and requested justice. The official ordered to go to the court for questioning at 9 am today.</p>
<h3>Kong Guangfu Implicated in Wu Kaixian Case</h3>
<p>Municipal Party Department Sends Letter to Court Clarifying</p>
<p>In the case of Zhou Zhongyi and others involving robbery and murder, which is being handled by the First Special District Local Court of this city, one of the defendants, Kong Guangfu, allegedly made statements implicating Wu Kaixian, a member of the Municipal Party Department. The court has sent a letter to the Municipal Party Department to inquire about this. It is heard that the Municipal Party Department has responded to the court with the following letter: "Regarding your letter No. 56, in which you stated that this court is handling the case of Zhou Zhongyi and others involving robbery and murder, and that the defendant Kong Guangfu testified that after Shi Jinkun was shot and killed on August 21st of the 16th year of the Republic of China, someone was entrusted to submit a request to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to forward it to the Central Party Department for approval and issue a pension. The petition's signatory and whether Kong Guangfu entrusted someone to submit it, and whether Wu Kaixian, the current Standing Committee member of your Municipal Party Department, held a position in your Municipal Party Department in the 16th, 17th, and 18th years of the Republic of China all need to be investigated. We hereby request your Municipal Party Department to investigate and verify the name of the signatory of Shi Jinkun's petition and Wu Kaixian's positions year by year in the 16th, 17th, and 18th years, and respond as soon as possible, etc. In response to the above, regarding the case of Kong Guangfu's suspected murder, it was previously reported that Kong made accusations in the police station implicating Wu Kaixian, a member of this committee, as ordering the murder. We initially intended to send a letter to correct this, but the news also reported that Kong clarified in your court that his previous statements in the police station regarding Wu Kaixian, a member of the Municipal Party Department, were purely false accusations, and that Wu Kaixian had no involvement or suspicion of ordering the murder, so we disregarded it. During the period of party purification in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the former Labor and Peasant Department of this party had an employee named Kong Guangfu (not Kong Guangfu), but he left after only a few months. When Shi Jinkun was shot and killed, Kong Guangfu was no longer working in this party department. As for the claim that someone was entrusted to submit a request to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to forward it to the Central Party Department for approval and issue a pension, this department was destroyed by rioters last year, and the files are lost, so there is no record to verify. The current Standing Committee member Wu Kaixian is not Hu Kaixian. Wu Kaixian served as the secretary of the Organization Department of this party department from April of the 16th year of the Republic of China to April of the 17th year. In May of the 17th year, he served as the head of the Organization Department. He assumed his current position in March of the 20th year. When Wu Kaixian was the secretary of the Organization Department, the head of the Organization Department was Leng Xin, the head of the Labor and Peasant Department was Zhou Zhiliao, and the Standing Committee members were Chen [blank], Pan Yizhi, and Huang Huiping. At that time, each department handled its own affairs independently, and the secretary's position was responsible for internal documents and other matters, with no interference in external affairs. Wu Kaixian had no authority to handle affairs of other departments or direct the work of staff in other departments, so there is no basis to suspect him of ordering the murder. We hereby reply accordingly, hoping for your consideration. Furthermore, Zhang Guomin and others have never held positions in this party. The report that they are also staff members of this party department is clearly inaccurate. We hereby declare this in conjunction. Respectfully addressed to the First Special District Local Court of Jiangsu Shanghai."</p>

<h3>Municipal Authorities</h3>
<p>Inspect Ferry and Seawater Bathing Area</p>
<p>Future Inspections and Rectifications to be Conducted Regularly</p>
<p>The municipal Pujiang ferries, from the Nanjing Road Bund to Gaoqiao in Pudong, are sometimes boarded by military and police personnel without tickets or who take up too many seats, leading to disputes. The coastal beach in Gaoqiao Town is being developed by the Municipal Ferry General Management Office into a simple seawater bathing area for the city's residents to swim and relax. However, some merchants there are selling beverages without a health bureau license, and using unboiled water to wash cups, which is detrimental to hygiene. In order to rectify municipal operations, Huang, the director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, accompanied by Wen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Hu, the director of the Health Bureau, took a municipal ferry to Gaoqiao yesterday morning (the 13th) to inspect the area. They will handle the issues separately based on their on-site investigations. It is understood that they will conduct future inspections from time to time to ensure rectification.</p>

<h3>Port Quarantine Office Cholera Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Ships from Tianjin, Xiamen, Shantou, and Other Ports to be Quarantined from Today</p>
<p>Wu Liande of the Port Quarantine Office issued the seventh cholera weekly report yesterday (the 13th). The translation is as follows: '(1) In the past week, up to July 9th, the weather has been getting hotter every day. The highest indoor temperature reached 93.2 degrees Fahrenheit, and the highest temperature was 99 degrees (still one degree away from the highest [saturation] temperature). This week (July 2nd to 9th), a total of 317 cholera cases were discovered, with 21 deaths. The breakdown is listed below:</p>
<p>(District) (Cases) (Deaths)</p>
<p>Shanghai City 120 5</p>
<p>Public Concession 150 (including 13 (including</p>
<p>two foreigners) two foreigners)</p>
<p>French Concession 47 (including one 3 (including one</p>
<p>foreigner) foreigner)</p>
<p>Previous 1020 61</p>
<p>Total 1337 82 (including 7 foreigners)</p>
<p>(2) From the above, it can be seen that the cholera mortality rate in Shanghai this time is still low, only 6.1%. Among the 130 cases, 9 cases had been vaccinated before the onset of the disease, so all 9 cases were cured and recovered. (3) According to reports from medical officers serving in the war zones, such as Baoshan, Dachang, Lishan, and Jiading, there are approximately 2,000 wells in Baoshan County, but no cholera outbreaks have occurred yet. The residents of the other three counties rely entirely on river water for drinking water, so 40 cholera cases have been discovered, with 30 deaths. (4) Among the eight epidemic hospitals in Shanghai, the Xizang Road epidemic hospital has the most patients. According to Dr. Deng's report from the hospital, there have been 6 miscarriages (4 to 8 months pregnant) discovered among the female patients in the hospital. (5) The reassuring news is that the Shanghai Waterworks Company (Public Concession) has now installed 26 free water taps in poor areas to provide free water. The Public Concession Board of Works has also donated 5 water trucks and all spare parts to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for transporting water to poor areas. The Board of Works' enthusiasm is truly commendable. It is hoped that the effectiveness of this measure will be as significant as the implementation of vaccination. (6) Recently, the epidemic has spread widely in the cities of Dalian, Yingkou, and Henan, Shanxi in the northeast, as far as Xuyuan. Therefore, the traffic on the Longhai Railway (western Henan) has been temporarily cut off. According to the above, the cholera mortality rate in these ports is very high, reaching 50% to 80%. (7) Because cholera has already spread in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Tanggu, and Tianjin, this office has announced that these ports are epidemic ports from July 14th. All ships arriving in Shanghai from these ports must raise the quarantine flag (yellow flag) upon arrival and wait for inspection. All passengers, crew members, and sailors must undergo quarantine. Before receiving a traffic permit issued by the quarantine medical officer, they must not leave the ship and go ashore to emphasize the importance of epidemic prevention."</p>
<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>Collision Case Opens - The British ship collided with and sank the Texaco oil tanker "Keta Huai" and damaged the wharf, resulting in huge losses. This matter has been recorded in this newspaper. The harbor master of the Jianghai Customs summoned the captains and pilots of each ship yesterday at the customs to investigate the responsibility. First, he asked the captain of the "Keta Huai" to report the process of the collision, and then asked the Jianghai pilot Lin Guoying of the British ship "Pudeng." Lin said that the "Pudeng" ship collided with the "Keta Huai" because the "Chengdu" ship at the stern pushed it, leaving no room for maneuver, and causing the disaster. The case still requires investigation of the facts and will be continued to be heard. The port authority has not announced the results of the first trial.</p>
<p>Tax on Small Packages - Ships in the Yangtze River often have crew members and waiters who privately carry goods without paying freight. This is called "small packages." The ship authorities have repeatedly rectified this, but they often superficially comply. There are even more "small packages" on the Ningbo Yangtze River ships. The Jianghan Customs has imposed a small package tax because the ships' small packages do not pay freight or customs duties, resulting in huge annual losses. This has been notified to the ships for investigation. The shipping company has already held a meeting to discuss and implement strict regulations to crack down on this.</p>

Secretary Sun, recognizing the huge losses suffered by the disaster victims in the war zone, expressed his deep sympathy.

<h3>Obligatory Work During Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>It is now early July, and most schools have already started their summer vacation. Here are some suggestions for students to consider during the summer vacation, for the academic community to study.</p>
<p>(1) Distributing Printed Materials. Although there are many new books and newspapers being published, they are limited to certain areas and cannot reach everyone. Someone once said, "The current cultural movement is an aristocratic cultural movement," which is a poignant statement. However, I believe that even the aristocratic aspect cannot truly become widespread. I don't think there's much optimism for this narrow and weak cultural movement. Seeing this, we must think of ways to remedy it. This summer vacation provides us with a good opportunity to vigorously promote cultural endeavors. Suppose we distribute easily understandable printed materials, publishing articles that are closely related to the readers. On the one hand, we can collect valuable and interesting articles from classmates and show them to others. This will not only spark their interest but also guide them to improve their writing. However, there are many things to consider when distributing such printed materials. Here are a few points:</p>
<p>Printing: It is best to use letterpress printing if possible; otherwise, mimeographing is also acceptable. The most important thing is that it should be clear and legible.</p>
<p>Binding: If it is letterpress printing, the format of the Saturday newspaper can be followed. If it is mimeographed, it is best to staple it into a small booklet so that people who read it don't easily lose it.</p>
<p>Pricing: It is best if it can be distributed completely free of charge, without charging a single cent. If there are financial difficulties, the price should be set at the lowest possible level, because we must adopt a spirit of sacrifice when running this type of newspaper.</p>
<p>Material: Of course, the focus should be on the common people, to give them a sense of class consciousness. In areas with many merchants, more articles about merchant awareness and apprentice liberation can be included. In areas with many farmers and workers, more articles related to farmers and workers should be included. In short, adapt to local conditions and strive to be practical.</p>
<p>Style: Use entirely vernacular Chinese so that everyone can understand.</p>
<p>Signature: Do not sign anything to avoid others saying that we are showing off. The responsibility for publishing articles should be borne jointly by the organizers.</p>
<p>(2) Summer Obligatory Schools. Everyone knows that to improve society, we must first popularize education. To popularize education, everyone knows that we must promote obligatory schools. But obligatory schools! This call has been made for many years, but how many have actually been opened? We can barely find a few in cities, and they have virtually no impact in rural areas! Everyone! We must not just engage in empty talk. Let's be down-to-earth and do our best to actually do it. Our hometowns should have at least one or two obligatory elementary schools. We can borrow equipment from local elementary schools, and we can also borrow the buildings of local elementary schools. The equipment and rental costs can all be saved. As long as we spend a few hours a day, we can give those ignorant compatriots the opportunity to learn to read and study.</p>
<p>(3) Practice Labor. We talk about the sacredness of labor every day and read books about the sacredness of labor. But let's ask ourselves, have we actually practiced labor ourselves at all? It's truly shameful! I advocate washing clothes, cleaning roads, etc. We must all put these things into practice, not just to save a few coins or use fewer servants. It can also exercise our muscles and bones, put our labor ideology into practice, and smash the signboard of the young master and government official. Furthermore, if we can gather a few classmates and live together during this period, preparing all the food ourselves, it will not only cultivate an independent character, but also create a lot of interest!</p>

<p>On March 2nd of this year, threatened by Japanese aircraft bombing, I moved with the old and young, wandering and fleeing, and arrived at Beishendian Bridge in Shaxi Town on the 18th. I resided in the home of a farmer surnamed Su. As time passed, I recorded my experiences and showed them to friends to tell of my suffering. I record my journey covered in dust, my lodgings have changed several times. The scenery is so bleak, the season is still Qingming. The chaotic world is also very poor, and the old farmers still till the land with hardship. I am ashamed to spread words idly, with no plan to benefit the people's livelihood. I arrived in a hurry to escape the invaders, meeting only old friends. They earnestly offer food and drink, and laughter and words comfort my hardships. It is hard to bear the sight of scars everywhere, and hard to hold back tears. We all share responsibility for the rise and fall, and I am ashamed to be spared. Where is the Peach Blossom Spring? Fortunately, I found a secluded place to live. The market is far away, and there are few guests and friends. The customs are simple, and etiquette is sparse. I foolishly talk about staying as an old farmer in the countryside, enjoying new vegetables with healthy meals. I cannot ask about the road ahead, entrusting my fleeting life to fate. Although I have lost my place in this displacement, it is not enough to lament the difficulties. My impoverished escape has unexpectedly strengthened me, and I feel at peace living in the wilderness. I sometimes read books by the fence and occasionally hold a fishing rod by the stream. I am deeply ashamed of stealing leisure, lacking the talent to reverse the tide.</p>
<p>Also sent to my second younger brother, Yulin</p>
<p>Counting the days, we have been separated for three months, and I send my longing in a letter from thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Laughter and words before the lamp often linger in my dreams, and the scenes of the calamity are half in poetry.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself in the lonely inn, and I will support my aging mother at home.</p>
<p>The cuckoo in Jiangguan cries out repeatedly, asking when the returning boat will arrive.</p>
<p>It is precisely in middle age that one has many feelings, and again I see the situation in chaos like hemp.</p>
<p>Brothers bickering among themselves plot against each other, and jackals and wolves lurk, sucking blood flowers.</p>
<p>A surge of solitary indignation should strike the oars, and a man can make his home anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Do you know if we often think of each other at the ends of the earth? Tonight, I finish composing the poem, and the moon is already setting.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Portland Cement</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Cement mixed with gravel and sand becomes concrete, which is widely used in construction. There are many types of cement, the most important of which is Portland cement. Now, I will describe its raw materials, composition, manufacturing method, and setting.</p>
<p>(1) Raw Materials. The most common raw materials are limestone or marl, and clay or shale.</p>
<p>(2) Composition. The percentage of its main components is as follows:</p>
<p>Lime (CaO) 60-64.5 Average 62.0</p>
<p>Silica (SiO2) 20-24.0 Average 22.0</p>
<p>Alumina (Al2O3) 5-9.0 Average 7.5</p>
<p>Magnesia (MgO) 1-4.0 Average 2.5</p>
<p>Iron Oxide (Fe2O3) 2-4.0 Average 2.5</p>
<p>Sulfur Trioxide (SO3) 1-1.75 Average 1.5</p>
<p>Among them, the ratio of lime to silica, alumina, and magnesia is approximately 1.9 to 2.1. The ratio of silica to alumina is approximately 2.5 to 4. These two ratios are very important when manufacturing cement. If there is too much lime, the cement will expand and break during setting. If there is too little lime, the cement will set too slowly. If there is a lot of silica, it will set very slowly. If there is a lot of alumina, it will set very quickly.</p>
<p>(3) Manufacturing. Mix the above raw materials according to their composition, grind them into a fine powder, and load them into a furnace (the temperature in the furnace is approximately 1450 to 1600 degrees Celsius). Heat them until they are close to the melting point. The resulting gray lumps are called clinker. Take them out and cool them, then crush them into powder. However, clinker sets very quickly, so gypsum is usually added, about 2% or 3% of the weight of the clinker, and ground finely at the same time as the clinker. Gypsum has the effect of inhibiting the setting of cement and is called a negative catalyst.</p>
<p>(4) Setting. Cement can turn into a hard, stone-like substance after adding water. This is because the clinker contains components such as (CaO)2·SiO(CaO)3·SiO2(CaO)2·Al2O3 and (CaO)3·Al2O3. When they come into contact with water, they become hydrates. These hydrates are crystalline and can turn into hard blocks.</p>
<h3>Family Matters</h3>
<h3>The Flavor of a Large Family</h3>
<p>— Meng Yuan</p>
<p>The Shen mansion in P Town is considered one of the leading large families! The house employs many old maids and servant girls. Their lives ought to be comfortable and harmonious with everyone catering to their needs, which is a human's most happy living. However, the reality is the opposite, with many disputes often occurring in their home.</p>
<p>According to rumors from people inside the Shen mansion, the reason for the quarrels is all due to the Second Young Mistress. The Second Young Mistress was married by the Second Young Master last year. She is a graduate of the XX Women's Normal School and is presumably very knowledgeable! However, she doesn't understand anything about family matters. Every day, she just puts on makeup and orders servants around. The Old Madam (an eighteenth-century old woman) doesn't think this is right. She believes that a daughter-in-law is supposed to help with household affairs. What's the use if she can't do anything? Is she just here to eat and do nothing? (She doesn't know that new-style women in the twentieth century are all like this.) Therefore, she can't help but grumble behind her back!</p>
<p>The Second Young Mistress is truly full of airs, a modern woman. Besides putting on makeup, eating, she also plays cards and mahjong. She treats her husband as a bank and her family as a hotel. The more highly educated a woman is, the more she does this.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Old Madam often complains about her behind her back, scolding her for just eating, dressing, and playing every day, without understanding anything about the household affairs, not even knowing the proper greetings for elders. She has never paid her respects once, truly an uncultured woman.</p>
<p>The Second Young Mistress is such a proud person, how could she not get angry when she heard these words? Therefore, she often cursed, saying, "The Old Madam is an old antique, a confused old woman, a stupid thing from the twentieth century. It's enough that I have food to eat and clothes to wear every day. Why do I need someone to manage some household affairs?"</p>
<p>As a result, the rift between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law deepened. Recently, the Second Young Mistress returned home, and the Old Madam happily said, "Now that she's gone, I can live in peace!"</p>
<p>Later, the Second Young Master sent a letter asking her (the Second Young Mistress) to go to S Port, but the Second Young Mistress didn't even go home to explain, she just went to S Port on her own!</p>
<p>After living in S Port for two months, the Second Young Master wanted to return to his hometown to see his family, but the Second Young Mistress refused to come with him. He couldn't do anything about it, so he had to let her go!</p>
<p>Ah! This is the so-called flavor of a large family with servants catering to one's needs!</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>The Lesson of Boarding the Train</h3>
<p>— Yuezhong Xiaocan</p>
<p>"The train is coming soon!" A road guard in a yellow uniform shouted like this, he continued to say to a customer in a suit, "Hey! Sir! Please step forward, the train is coming, you will be hit!"</p>
<p>Woo... Woo... In the eardrums of every passenger, the train sounded far and near, the objects placed on the ground, all in orderly fashion, were picked up to prepare for the train to stop at the station, immediately go up, and find a comfortable seat.</p>
<p>Squeak... Squeak... The train pulled into the station, and the porter on the third carriage stuck his head out of the window and shouted, "Back!" "Back is empty!" But the passengers didn't care whether it was the front or the back, they just scrambled to get on.</p>
<p>The classmates traveling together were also scattered at that moment, only the leader, Mr. Xie, and I were still together.</p>
<p>"Did you hear that! The porter said the back is empty! Let's go to the back, shall we!" Mr. Xie asked me like this.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, let's go to the back, it's good that the back is empty!" I replied casually.</p>
<p>Arrived at carriage I, then carriage II, the porter in the window similarly stuck his head out and shouted, "Back!" "Back is empty!" We followed his instructions and walked back two more carriages, all of which were second class, but as we walked, the porter stuck his head out and similarly shouted, "Back!" "Back is empty!" We walked straight to the last carriage, and he was still shouting, "Back!"</p>
<p>"Back is empty!" At this time, we were really sweating profusely from walking and couldn't walk anymore.</p>
<p>With a "woo" sound, the train started moving, and we had to reluctantly jump into the last carriage. Once we got on the train, the reality told us that the porter was a truthful guide.</p>
<p>"We've been tricked! We've been tricked! It would have been better if we had boarded the front carriages earlier. The porter said 'the back is empty,' where is the emptiness? Terrible, terrible," Mr. Xie said regretfully like this.</p>
<p>"Alas! Really, we've been tricked. We walked so much, sweated so much, and couldn't find a seat, so we had to insert candles. But we've suffered this time, next time we'll learn to be smarter."</p>
