<h3 id="c27">本屆國聯行政會之面面觀翰 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>國聯行政會於今日開第六十六屆會議於日内瓦。於其三十餘條議程中。列有東北問題。國聯受理此案。至此已爲第四次。而於此第四次會議之時。適値遼案緊張之形勢。已擴至上海而有所謂突發事件。且此突發事件。形勢亦甚嚴重。蓋上海旣爲各國僑商居住之地。又爲國際經濟中心。當然爲國聯中人極度關心之問題。而議會將取何種態度。又必爲世界人士所極端注目者也。</p>
<p>自九一八至今。我當局對東北問題之應付。始終信仰國聯之必能伸張公義。故雖三次會議無結果。而中國當局。仍信仰國聯不衰。據今日日内瓦電。我國總代表顔惠慶博士對新聞記者稱。「中國不願援用會章第十六條。擬仍依賴理事會自己决定其他最妥善方法。以解决中日爭端。中國人民咸贊助國聯。望其能盡厥責吾人現覺國聯之存在。已見動搖。故吾人願竭力輔助國聯。證明國聯會章與理事會决議案是否有效」云云。觀顔博士之聲明。足爲我國當局仍將依賴國聯之確證。不提十六條。而希望國聯之自擇方法則信賴國聯。可謂至矣盡矣。惟國聯對此今日形勢更非昔日三次會議時形勢之中日問題。是否能改變其態度。是否能另擇善法。則吾人不能無懷疑耳。我國民鑒於國聯迭次會議之無辦法。希望政府於依賴國聯之外。另闢一新的外交途徑而政府則徘徊而不能决。反觀對手方之日本則如何耶。自若摫内閣於去年十一月十一日辭職後。犬養毅以政友會總裁之資格。出而組閣。調任駐法大使兼國聯代表之芳澤謙吉爲新外相。以「俄國通」聞世之荒木貞夫中將爲新陸相。新内閣對華政策。皆一致抱强硬的態度。取積極的策略。政府與軍人。更趨一貫。從此外交軍事。雙管齊下。對華政策之將愈緊張。不待言矣。新外相芳澤由西伯利亞東歸。而日俄不侵犯條約。忽然甚囂塵上。其於外交上之布置。幾使國際間所有之困難。完全排除。且自九一八以後。芳澤治終在國聯折衝。以「狂吸雪茄」「詞令遲慢」之閒暇態度。對付國聯。而國聯各要人。皆無奈之何。今觀察國聯體味入微之芳澤。旣内調爲外相。行見本屆國聯行政會。芳澤將安居東京。發號施令。運籌帷幄。遊刃而有餘矣。</p>
<p>至於國際間之空氣。以東北問題拖延至今。輿論已日趨於麻木不仁。日本利用此機會。一方集中全副精神期在短期間内消滅各處轟起之義勇軍。他方面則盡力向國際宣傳。日本目前在東北之主要任務爲「勦匪」。爲「膺懲。」以故最近歐洲報紙。對東北問題之標題。已從「日本佔領滿洲。」一變而爲「日本在滿勦匪。」可知歐洲輿論界之空氣。已完全爲日本電訊政策所籠罩。在本屆行政會未開會前已先造成一「是非顚倒」「皂白不分」之局面。則開會後將如何情形。已可默想而得矣。</p>
<p>且目前國際間之情勢。處處暴露極大之危機。一方面自德總理白魯寗氏宣佈德國無力還債以後。取消賠欵問題。已成爲歐美國際問題之重心。自洛桑會議被法國打消以後。賠償一事。成爲僵局。歐美當局皆勞心焦思。無法解决。世界經濟恐慌。日益擴大而亦無法補救。他方面軍縮會議又將開幕。列强雖日日言减軍。而仍日日以擴張軍備爲務。對軍縮毫無誠意。此兩事皆足以證明現世界已在極端矛盾之危機中。列强終日旁皇。期所以挽救此狂瀾。籌劃自身生死問題之不暇。又安能望其在國聯會中解决中日問題乎。然則我國今日之仍欲依賴國聯者。可以深長思之矣。</p>

<p>自從資本主義的黃金世界裏。出現了實行社會主義的蘇維埃聯邦共和國以來。這世界立即引起了異常的不安。資本主義的維護者。自是極端的予以誣衊中傷</p>
<p>、迫害、即一般保守的大衆。也對之懷着十分的疑惑。總之。蘇聯在世人的眼目中只是一種新奇的怪物。一種可怖的毒物。如像洪水猛獸一般的不容親近。</p>
<p>就如最近英國大文豪蕭伯納從英倫去訪問蘇聯。當他决定動身時候。他底親戚都如像死别一樣的哭起來。懇求他不要冐生命的危險。可是他一定要去。他們沒有法子。便送去許多包的食物、臥具帳蓬、以及一切需用的東西。他們都以爲蕭氏去到蘇聯。一定會挨餓。一定會找不着食宿之所。這是一幕何等滑稽的喜劇呀。而同時世人對於蘇聯的懷疑與誤解之深。好像是現今世界上一片未知的國土。簡直視爲一塊黑暗的大陸。另一個不可測的世界。我們也就可以想見了。不過在這世界。蘇聯確是一個奇異的國家。因爲蘇聯的存在與發展。使資本主義的國家感受到極鉅大的威脅。更使資本主義的生命之前途。蒙上一個極其黑暗悲慘的網。對於這一個資本主義世界的叛逆。大家都懷着仇恨。認爲不可以共存的敵意。所以當蘇聯革命之初。各國就實行對他經濟封鎖。實行武裝壓迫。四面包圍。使莫斯科成爲一座極危困的孤城。從一九一九至一九二一。蘇聯無日不在艱苦的鏖戰中。經歷接連幾年的奮鬥。蘇聯終於殺出了重圍。奠定了社會主義的基石。且更動搖資本主義的統治。在這樣兩條戰綫之上。資本主義國與非資本主義國的爭鬥。日益尖銳。日益激烈。因爲資本主義國家對蘇聯嫉惡仇恨之深。其造謠誣衊破壞。也愈益無所不用其極。而蘇聯的眞相。亦愈益不能爲世人所明瞭。十幾年來。世人對於蘇聯。只有殘酷的批評。或者說「這是人道之敵呀」。或者說「這是和平的擾者呀」。差不多呌遍了資本主義的世界。其實在蘇聯。人民雖說得不着很豐足的供給。但並沒有一方面過着極其豐裕的生活。而另一方面却忍受着飢寒與貧困的矛盾。尤其沒有將剩積的生産品燒掉而不分配與飢寒的國民的事實。雖說一般人工作時間都很長。但並沒有一方面安逸坐食他人的血汗。而另一方面被役使爲牛馬奴隷的矛盾。一切的利益。都由大衆平等的共同享受。一切的艱苦。也都由大衆平等的共同負擔。大家都向着一個理想的目標努力邁進着。</p>
<p>而且在整個世界經濟凋敝之下。每一個資本主義國家都束手徬徨。就連黃金之國的華盛頓政府。也不能例外。最近日本新聞聯合社東川喜一氏所編一種世界經濟現勢的圖表。書名呌做「世界往何處去。」揭示種種的失業如次。</p>
<p>「歐戰時的好景氣。各處有所謂船的暴發戶。因爲那時無論怎樣的破。都有驚奇的價値。可是現在雖是很漂亮的船。也都現出他的紅肚皮。變成閒着的船了。英國現有二百○四萬噸的閒船。差不多佔英國所有船的十分之一。日本則爲三十一萬頓。美國有二百六十六萬噸。···。講到造船工塲。那末任何一國都是半休或全停的狀態。····</p>
<p>「截至一九三一年八月一日。美國失業者有五百十萬人。到冬天怕要增到七百萬人。····德國失業人數在一九三一年的冬天。也要突破六百萬亦未可知：「不只是人船機械資本也失業。了躱在銀行的庫裏打呵欠。因爲失業而生意做得格外膽小。如是長期放欵。利息特别高。條件亦更苛刻。······」</p>
<p>他如購買力的减退。信用的收縮。貨幣的不穩。借欵的重負。産業的不振等。世界飢寒羣衆的嗷嗷哀聲。已經響澈雲霄了。獨有蘇聯站在這不景氣的圈外。每一個國民都帶着無限的希望。無限的歡欣。而孜孜工作着。</p>
<p>蕭伯納總不會說謊罷。當他訪問了蘇聯返至柏林的那一天。對新聞記者鄭重地說道。「如果你在那個地方親眼見過布爾希維克是什麽東西。那末你一定能覺得資本主義快要滅亡了。」去年七月三十一日。他在莫斯科全蘇的公共團體和文學團體爲他七十五歲祝壽的盛會裏。也曾說。「我覺得貴國各方面的現象。都有一種新氣象。這種新氣象。若到西方各國去找。一定是失望的。」蕭氏的話。該不會欺騙我們罷。</p>
<p>次如美人艾迪博士。是一位熱烈的基督敎信徒。在蘇聯革命後。先後到過四次。最近在他的蘇俄的眞相一書中說。「沒有别的國家能像蘇聯那樣的要藉着自己的統計。又用了全副精神去供給人民的需要。並且要使國家的經濟。在生産與消費方面的各部份。都能和人民的需要相適合。」</p>
<p>又如美國林克大學守舊的經濟學敎授胡佛氏。以社會科學研究會會員的資格。往蘇聯作長時間的考察以後。就寫了下面一段話說「關於人類歷史上最大的一種經濟與社會試騐的進程。世界上的人。不是茫無所知。便是以訛傳訛。······在現在的時候。美國要抑止少數的共産主義者。並以嚴厲的法令取締共産黨的宣傳。又用警察的勢力。拘捕共産黨的鼓動者。都是徒然的。也是不聰明的。···承認蘇聯眞正的活動事業。並且决意拿蘇聯所有試騐的材料。適應我們自己國家的需要。都是很重要的。······資本主義的制度。若沒有方法大大的改進最低工人階級的生活程度。同時又不能調和國際經濟上的競爭。那末一種戰鬥的興奮狂熱的蘇聯式的共産主義。在最近的十年中。可以打破柏林的門戶了。」（見艾迪蘇俄的眞相第一章）</p>
<p>那末我們對於蘇聯的政治制度之是好或壞經濟制度之是合理或不合理。應該可以從上述的話中求得答案來。</p>

<p>汕頭通信、潮梅人口繁殖、每年移往南洋羣島者、約十五六萬人、自一九二八年南洋受世界不景氣之影響土産滯銷、失業工人日增、匯水高漲、各埠商務冷淡、一九三零年八月一日、新嘉坡英殖民地政府下禁止華工入口令、其初每月准運二千三百二十一人進口、以廈門香港海口汕頭四埠爲限、至一九三一年十月一日、再縮減華人入口額爲一千一百六十名、汕頭每月在四埠中、僅分得四百張客票、各輪船公司因客票額旣受限制、乃將輪船調往别埠行走、聞本月一日起、新嘉坡續頒第七次限制華工人口令、此爲我國移民南洋所受最大之打擊、亦潮梅人士謀生之一大不幸事也、</p>
<p>其次則爲荷屬東印度增收華人入口稅、遏止華工入境、查十年前華人往八打威爪哇羣島者其初、每人收登岸稅二十五盾、繼則增至五十盾、一九二九年增至一百盾、一九三一年四月一日起增至一百五十盾、且須隨身携帶、登岸時繳納、否則不准登陸、旣繳稅金、仍須當地商店蓋印擔保、始得自由執業謀生、自此例頒後、潮梅往荷屬謀生者幾瀕絶境、</p>
<p>又次則爲暹邏政府一九三　年八月一日所頒之移民新例、自十一月起、凡華人進口、每人須繳稅金八十銖、未領得當地出國護照、或未證明何國籍民、則不准進口、此後每年仍須繳納身稅金十銖、此例實行後、在暹日餘萬華僑、負擔益重、謀生益難、</p>
<p>又次則爲安南西貢、亦於去年頒行新例、凡新客進境、須在新客衙門繳十五元登岸執照費、但此執照不能行使於河内諸地、限制華僑移動非常嚴格、華人每年除納人頭稅外、尙須納彙進稅、華人幾無法自全、</p>
<p>總上各種情形、我國政府旣漠不關心、爲有效之救濟、僑民更無法團結、改善環境、去年汕頭方面、常有從南洋各地解回失業之華工到埠、鳩形萊色、爲狀極慘、此等回國華僑、大都由華僑互助社代向市府請求舟車半費券遣之回籍而已查去年匯水高漲、華僑批信匯欵回汕、約四千餘萬元、前年爲五千餘萬元、照匯水額伸算、外貲輸入内地、去年約減一半有奇（前年每新加坡銀一元値國幣一元四角、去年每元値國幣二元二角至二元六角、）此項問題關、係潮梅人民生計、至鉅且大、因去年匯欵回汕者、多爲南洋華僑小資産家、因在南洋無法經營、故將其現有</p>
<p>之生産事業、盡行拍賣携欵歸來、非如前年時之多爲工人匯欵養家者可比也、查一九三零年從汕頭往南洋之人數爲十一萬五千七百九十一人、返國者爲九萬三千七百六十七人、在一九三一年各處限制華工入口後、從汕頭出口之華僑爲</p>
<p>五萬八千二百三十八人、返國華僑爲六萬五千八百六十六人適得相反之數、開空前未有入口超過出口之數字、此實今日嚴重問題也、（十七日）</p>

<h3 id="c77">兵工廠小輪輸運炸藥爆裂 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>年久炸藥疑係火星觸發</p>
<p>大中輪與拖船燬成虀粉</p>
<p>三十餘人僅蒯先發獲救</p>
<p>漁船及附近房屋同遭殃</p>
<p>昨日下午三時三十分、南市外日暉港西、北票碼頭外江面、忽發劇烈之爆炸聲、轟然巨響、黑烟冲天、遠近數十里、窗戶房屋、均被震動、一時全市警惶、謠諑蠶起、茲經關查、始悉係兵工廠運輸炸藥駁船、在浦江中失愼爆炸、死難者三十餘人、僅一人獲救、亦受重傷、運輸炸藥之小輪、及二駁船均遭炸沉、全部損失不貲、茲將詳情分誌如次、</p>
<p>運輸炸藥上海兵工廠需用炸藥料向由廠輪大中·淞雲·二艘、向浦東老鼠沙火藥庫裝運、依例每星期裝運一次、即派廠輪駁運、昨日亦然、該廠庶務課當於隔晚命該廠大中小輪、預僱民用駁船四艘、裝運砲彈廠火藥料（該廠廠工習稱爲黑藥）一百餘箱、分兩次由浦東拖帶來滬應用、</p>
<p>浦江爆炸大中小輪於昨日午後拖帶駁船艘、至浦東裝運該項黑色炸藥、先由駁船兩艘、裝載炸藥五十五箱、於下午、一時許、由大中小輪拖至西砲台碼頭卸去、於二時許卸竣、當於三時開回浦東碼頭、此際其餘兩駁船、已將炸藥四十五箱裝竣、遂復由該輪於三時二十分拖帶駛出、於三時三十分駛至日暉港西北票碼頭外江面、突發砰然一聲、濃烟冲天、拖船中彈藥轟炸無遺、二駁船被炸粉碎、大中輪亦頓時炸沉、但另據警備司令部方面消息、謂該部據調查報告、大中小輪拖帶駁船兩艘、共裝炸藥一百餘箱云云、</p>
<p>海軍施救當該輪被炸後、海軍警衛營水巡隊方面、尙未得悉眞相、遂疑有意外事項發生、當即派萬和江康江安三小輪、由該隊王隊副率同衛兵十餘人、馳往該處、時正三時卅五分、惟其時大中輪及所拖之駁船二艘、已完全炸毁、所有大中輪及駁船上人員、均已慘遭炸斃、僅由水巡隊在浦江中救起大中二副　先發一人、五時許、萬和小輪又撈獲屍身一具、係大中輪燒　之王莊大、昨晚該死遂停放海軍碼頭、並由該廠方面通知其家屬、一面萬和輪仍在打撈中、</p>
<p>肇禍原因據目擊此項奇樂之兵工廠職員研究所得、謂昨日風勢爲西北風、且其勢頗猛、當大中輪拖往浦中時、輪上煙囱之烟、因風勢關係、向後面駁船上吹去、烟中雜有火星此項炸藥、存貯過久、易於爆炸、重以日來天時溫暖、爲種種不幸之原因凑合、炸藥乃告爆裂、又據大通社消息、此次礮彈火藥在船中爆裂之原因、據最可恃之觀察、該「黑藥」爲淸宣統年間所儲、年代久遠、性甚亢燥而當時藥箱又不甚攷究、僅用本版製成、木乾而縮、致有箱縫、雖經該廠用紙張將箱縫黏貼、但終非妥善、裝入駁船後、附纜於大中輪後、拖牽行駛、而大中又輪身低小、致有烟囱中冒出烟火、颺入藥箱縫中、致突然爆發、不可收拾、</p>
<p>漁船橫禍當炸藥爆炸時、聲如巨砲、黑烟衝天、黃浦中江水鼎沸、附近有漁船兩艘、因船身較小、竟被炸力抛起丈餘之高、即時覆沒、船中男女老幼、均葬身浦中、尙有帆船一艘、被炸藥火星所燃、立時焚燒、幸即駛救、袛燬帆布一襲、大中輪後部遭猛力轟炸、其鐵錨竟飛起數丈、擊中北票碼頭内義泰興煤棧三樓玻窗、被毁甚巨、幸未傷人、</p>
<p>毁牆碎窗當爆炸時、聲聞數十里、南市及法租界居戶、均各感有極强烈之地震、高昌廟附近房屋被震坍者頗多、龍華路南洋中學、倒坍墻垣一堵、當時學生因不明眞相、均紛紛返家、其餘南市一帶店舖、如小東門福安公司等玻窗、均被震碎、</p>
<p>死傷人數昨日死傷人數、以時間短促、尙無精確統計、據兵工廠方面謂、被難者至少在三十人左右、查大中小輪共有職工七人、老軌錢潤金·老大顧月生·二副蒯先發·水手袁義財·魏阿四·王莊大·王金坤四人袁義財因病請假未罹此禍、而當時遇救者、亦衹蒯先發一人其餘兩駁兩駁船上船夫十餘人無一獲救、而同遭沉沒之兩漁船、死傷人口、當亦在十餘人以上、總計共逹三十人左右、蒯傷危險遇救之二副蒯先發、頭部已被炸有重傷、當由該廠庶務科彭科長着人用汽車送往上海醫院醫治、聞傷勢頗重、恐有性命之虞、</p>
<p>嚴重戒備當禍變發生時、本埠海陸軍警各機關聞警、即宣告戒嚴、並派員四出偵查、高昌廟海軍警衛營、以該處關係最屬重要、即宣告戒嚴、於碼頭四週、散放步哨、以防萬一、事後雖據報確悉炸藥爆裂、然恐好宄之徒、乘機搗亂故戒備仍不少衰、高昌廟附近駐防之陸軍、且禁止行人通行、</p>
<p>善後辦法昨日適爲星期日、兵工廠職員多未在廠、據該廠庶務課彭課長談、關於此事之善後辦法、因廠長在京、故一時尙難確定、惟廠中對於此次因公罹難之工友撫卹、當仍照向例辦理、現一方面正設法打撈屍身云云、淞滬警備司令部昨據確報後、即晚已呈報軍政部矣、</p>

<p>發表宣言</p>
<p>全國郵務職工總會成立宣言云、我們念念不忘的全國郵務職工總會、經過全國郵務職工、在艱難困苦的環境中、奮鬥了三年之久、到了今天才能和國人相見、我們不自覺地感到忻慰而歌之舞之了、我們回想過去三年中的奮鬥經騐、我們追求今後的努力前途、我們不能不覺到此艱難困苦中所産生的組織、是怎樣的可愛可貴、但同時又不能不感覺到此初生的組織、將怎樣努力、以衝破此惡劣環境中的重重荊棘、在此外憂内患交相侵逼的時候、尤其是自從「九一八」事變發生以來、全國民、衆都沉鬱在悲慘與哀憤的感覺中、想以整個民族的力量、來解决目前一切困難、我們認爲現在民衆第一步應做的事情、是自動地組織起來、連繫各個分散的力量、變成爲有組織有團結的力量、來和一切惡勢力及帝國主義者相奮鬥、這樣才能解除我們的痛苦、亦只有這樣才是整個國家整個民族的出路、我們全體郵務職工、深切地感覺到這點、所以將各地郵務職工團體集合爲總會的組織、我們一方覺得我們實力的增、大同時我們亦承認我們對於國家及社會所擔負的責任加重了、於此我們不得不提出本總會的使命、以昭告國、人民衆團體和政治、是根本不能脫離關係的、我們不僅只消極地認識這一點、而且還要積極地輔助政府、以充實這一層認識、爲什麽中國的政治、還是夠不上說已上執道、爲什麽、歷年來軍閥政府的苛捐雜稅、沒有引起民衆的反感、爲什麽國内還有起伏不定的内戰、最後、又爲什麽各帝國主義者明侵暗奪、把中國弄成一個次殖民地的國家、爲什麽中國民衆、對於不平等條、約沒有解除的辦法、我們敢大胆說一句、這些和民衆利益相反的一切的一切之所以存在、根本是爲了民衆沒有組織、沒有力量、不能輔助政府的緣故爲實行團結民衆、共赴國難、此本總會之所以成立者一、郵政是交通事業之、一負宣達文化發展國民經濟的極大使命、根本不是一個牟利的機關、近幾年來、因内政之更形腐化、投機之徒盤踞了郵政要職、不從郵政的使命上來做應做的事、衹知便利私、圖不惜打破郵政考試制度、以安插親戚故舊、並將郵政轉到商業的行爲上去、和一般商民來爭利、前年所成立的郵政儲金匯業局、就是很顯明的例子、我們郵務職工、現在進一步明瞭、只有我們本身來努力、才能達到郵政所負的眞使命、我們主張、郵政經濟應、絶對公開和獨立、郵政經濟、應儘先發展郵務·擴充郵綫但是分散的職工力量、是不能糾正當局的錯誤政策的、只有職工團結起來、在有組織的努力中、才能打破目前惡劣的環境、才能眞正負起郵政的根本使命、爲督促郵政當局、主持郵政經濟獨立、努力發展郵務、此本總會之所以成立者、二這次本總會代表大會、到會代表、雖有十六省區之多、但尙有不少邊遠之區、或因整個組織尙未成立或因環境關係、未能推派代表出席、這是本總會在這次大會中、所最感到美中不足的一點、我們知道、現在尙無組織之邊遠省區、或已有組織而並不健全的地方、其不組織或不健全之原因、根本不是職工們革命性之欠缺、是因人數較少、組織力量不足的緣故邊遠區域之同、人其需要整個組織之熱切、必較已有組織的區域爲更甚、現在總會組織、業已成立、我們相信在本總會領導之下、凡尙無組織、或只有不甚健全的組織的區域、必能因之而組織起來、健全起來、使總的組織更有力量、同時使散的組織、亦有所保障、爲促進各地會務、實現全國郵務職工團結、此本總會之所以成立者三、在百孔千瘡的中國社會中、自然沒有一個社會機關、可以說完美無缺的、祗有郵政還算是在國營公用事業中的佼佼者、其實要認淸郵政之所以得到此較好的成績、全是由於我們郵政人員的奉公守法、刻苦耐勞、可是現在郵政當局、一方剝削郵務職工的旣得我益、一方居然拿我們郵務職工的所努力獲得的盈餘、去恭維人家、結果、使郵政經濟、因不絶破壞而瀕於破産、現在郵局因經濟的困難、已令各郵區實行緊縮政策、在此現狀下、郵務職工們的待遇、當然更談不到改善、須知郵政建設方面的各項開支、純屬促進郵務所必需、現在的緊縮政策無異於自殺政策、以如此的郵政當局、倘若繼續想把建設郵政的經費、改善職工待遇的經費拿來自肥、我們是必然要極力反對的、但沒有總的組織力量、怎樣能抑制當局的野心、爲維護郵政、以期改善職工待遇、此本總會之所以成立者四、末了、我們再要說幾句、在本總會領導之下的郵務職工、雖足以代表全國郵務職工的全部、但尙有其他部份的、郵務職工、是在友會之下所領導的、我們希望在最近的將來、友會的總的組織成立後能夠同我們携手並進、共同奮鬥、我們相信在共同努务下、上述四項目的、必然更能費澈、更有把握、這是本總會在欣慶成立中的極大願望、再郵局是國營公用事業、服務於郵政的人們的唯一目的是服務社會努力人羣通訊交通的便利、所以說郵政不僅是國家的郵政、實在是全社會的郵政、因此郵政的榮枯與全國國民有切身利害的關係、本總會成立伊始、願永久秉承上述使命、爲民衆努力、並希望全國同胞、給我們以同情的援助、謹此宣言、中華民國全國郵務職工總會、二十一年一月二十四日、</p>

<p>七號棧房全燬</p>
<p>火塲損失鉅萬</p>
<p>英商怡和洋行所經理之其昌棧、在楊樹浦威賽碼頭浦江對岸、分東西兩棧、佔地均甚寬廣、去年十二月二十五日、西棧失愼、燒去棉花五千餘包鋼骨鐵板所建之Ｈ棧房、亦付之一炬、爲去年滬上罕見之大火、不謂事隔一月、西棧餘燼尙未熄滅、而昨晚東棧又告火警、自下午七時半左右起、燒至深夜、尙未全熄、損失之鉅、不下西棧、被燒貨物、亦以棉花爲大宗、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>夜工堆貨其昌東棧昨晨到有『日本太子號』輪船一艘、靠碼頭卸貨昨日係星期日、例皆休息、惟因船上貨物争於起卸、故該輪除白晝開工外、入晚亦另開夜工、將各貨從輪中卸下、次第堆入第七號棧房、其貨物爲白蠟烟紙等件、直至起火時止、各貨尙未卸淸、</p>
<p>突然起火昨日下午七時半左右、夜工已開、各工人正在忙碌堆卸貨物之時、突聞七號棧房中爆裂、發有異聲、俄而烟霧迷漫、火焰四竄、小工等即退出棧外、而巨禍已肇、濃烟蘊鬱、中人欲嗆、片刻間即爆發蔓延、馴至七號棧房全屋皆火、不可收拾、</p>
<p>全棧被焚火起後、該棧自備之救火小輪、即自浦江接水灌救、移時警報傳出、海關小輪爛泥渡救火車及工部局救火會小輪等、均到塲施救、無如棧中所堆者、除新上棧之白蠟及烟葉等雜貨外尙堆藏有棉花一千數百包、火起後、白蠟熔化、着物即燃、加以棉花助虐、勢乃愈熾、雖經各救火員竭力灌救、初亦無效、直至兩小時後、火勢始稍稍就範、然屋頂已完全燒毁、只留四週斷垣而已、</p>
<p>危險萬分遭殃之七號棧房、介於六號及九號之間、六號棧所儲者、大半爲火油、六七兩棧、相隔甚近、故七號起火後、六號棧房岌岌可危、萬一被火焰帶着、則决無倖理、油類爆發、危險之鉅、難以設想矣、幸當時經救火員竭力設法、隔絶火熖、因未肇大禍、</p>
<p>西棧餘燼西棧於十二月二十五日失愼、與昨日東棧火警前後相隔、爲時適屬一個月、西棧所焚者、因係大宗棉花、一個月來、餘燼未熄、常有死灰復燃之虞、故該棧常川派人駐守、以備隨時灌救、詎西棧之餘燼未熄而東棧又突告失愼、昨日遭殃之七號棧房建築時日已久、非若西棧之用鋼骨水泥築告者、故火起後屋西被焚甚速、火光熊熊、直冲霄漠、在滬西外灘已能遙矚而見之、棧内所堆棉花·白蠟·烟葉·木材·火漆·油類等、大都保有火險、損失鉅萬、確數未詳、但聞棉花一項、已値十數萬元、加以其他貨物、損失之鉅、可想而知、</p>

<p>丨結果零對三丨</p>
<p>甲組錦標不免搖動</p>
<p>丨史谷德現居首席丨</p>
<p>抱有西人會甲組冠軍希望之曁南隊、昨日因大將陳鎭和腿傷缺席、前鋒缺少指揮領袖、致毫無進攻能力、幸其内衛堅强、尙能維持、七十五分鐘半壁江山、平安過去、忽而改變戰略、調梁樹棠出任前鋒、漏洞一露、連失三球、時間告終零對三之結果、敗於臘克斯、甲組錦標前途、不免搖動、中華棒球塲觀者亦都爲之掃興矣裁判麥雪兒、</p>

<p>江善敬　　　　陳鎭祥</p>
<p>陳福忠梅洪寳</p>
<p>出戰未久舊創復發</p>
<p>曁南迎風作戰、丘中鋒撥球進取、球往返中區無甚出入、將五分鐘、丘氏舊創復發、出場休養、曁南軍心一震、敵人入侵四面壓迫、五路並進、陳部章·江善敬·馮運佑·梁樹棠·分别攔擋無隙可乘、十分鐘後、丘氏扶傷應戰、局勢轉爲平衡、丘氏攻門力弱、臘克斯守門隨手接出梁樹棠加以接濟、梅洪寳平地射去又入守門手中、</p>
<p>各憑天命龍門保全</p>
<p>全局形勢曁南前鋒進攻無力、内部當然加倍吃驚、但見敵人紛紛入寇、環攻不已、偶然突圍反攻、亦無驚人之、舉梁樹棠忽下决志、一枝孤軍、竟作遠征、雖未中的、略慰人心、　克斯前衛培克、亦遙出攻門、江善敬回擋、稍斜、球反向内趨、幸觸木柱、竟告無恙、死裏逃生、前鋒爲之奮起、先迫成角球、繼由梅洪寳傳中、終見丘東炎頂門、中在門柱、丘氏隨以一脚、又越門後一聲銀笛、上半時告終、零對零、</p>
<p>策略錯誤連失三球</p>
<p>下半塲起、曁南頗有轉機、助以風力、益覺有聲有色、梅洪寳身臨敵門、不自攻打、讓諸丘氏、丘氏痕未全、安有勁力、遂致大好良機、付之流水、臘克斯興兵、亦無效果、乃成互持局面、三十分鐘内、曁南以内部堅强、平安無事、忽遇臘克斯前衛Ｈ馬達蹈球倒地、傷臂出塲、以爲天賜其便、改變策略、梁符互調地位、藉以側重攻面、不料因此變動、即見愛爾琪乘隙傳球門前、陳部章雙手拍出、湯潑尼迎之以頭、正中門内江口一决、洪水源源而來、愛爾琪踢入第二球勞克哈又中第三球</p>
<p>覆巢之下英雄失性</p>
<p>當第一球失守之時、曁南又以馮莊互調、冀厚前鋒力量、誰知第二第三接連打入、於是完全注重進攻、或有轉機希望、惟球員身感覆巢之痛、竟至舉動野蠻實爲失計彼時於二俠精神重於勝負之一語、想已置之腦後、江善敬發性、犯規罰出、曁南又因此失去一道防綫、然其時雙方戰士、均無鬥志、不久即告閉幕、曁南以零對三失敗、從此林肯西捕在甲組地位無形中似昇上一級、而史谷德昨以四對零勝海軍、實際反居各隊之首、</p>

<p>看報不看廣告是一個很誤事的態度。我昨天早上把報紙展開來，彷彿在廣告欄裏見有「放棄縣長資格」幾個大字，當時並未留意，順手一翻便翻到國家大事上去了。</p>
<p>這幾個字雖被我的忽略廣告的態度連帶着忽略而去，但是它們在我的潛意識中，不知道怎樣，已經印了一個很深刻的印像。於是「放棄縣長資格」······「放棄縣長資格」······「放棄縣長資格」······接二連三的從我的腦海中浮了出來，最</p>
<p>後，我忽然下了一個斷語，「放棄縣長資格，怕不是一個尋常的廣告吧！」我便重新把報紙翻開，找着這樣一個標題：『前溧陽縣長李晋芳聲明放棄江蘇省第二屆考取縣長資格』</p>
<p>我從頭到尾把内容仔細看了一遍摘錄了下列幾條事實</p>
<p>㈠李晋芳因舉發財政局長潘可平舞弊被潘可平引薦人即蘇省主席葉楚傖停職</p>
<p>㈡李晋芳停職後乃將省方對於本案疏通關脫等不法行爲分呈監察院及鎭江地方法院；</p>
<p>㈢監察院已提出彈劾該案首犯，潘可平亦經軍政部捕禁；</p>
<p>㈣江蘇省甄用章程明示薦用人員發覺貪汚時應予舉薦人以懲戒葉楚傖等仍然無損毫鬆；</p>
<p>㈤江蘇第二屆縣長考試，葉楚傖爲主試委員，故與李晋芳有師生關係。李晋芳仿顧亭林否認爲貳臣錢謙益門生之例自動放棄考取縣長資格並拒領覆核文憑；</p>
<p>㈥李晋芳聲明前在湖北政務委員會試取縣長資格，雖無用處，自願存留。如果上述各節完全確實，那末李前縣長這篇聲明書是含有重要意義；這意義之所以重要是因爲它的裏面包含了一個具有代表牲的奮鬥丨在貪汚之下，貪汚之上，貪汚之中，奮鬥出一個廉潔的縣長來。</p>
<p>奮鬥纔是建設廉潔政府之康莊大道。我們要律已不苟，律上不苟方能創造出一個廉潔的社會。</p>

<p>— 張炎</p>
<p>頃讀湖南省縣政報告。載各縣社會風俗頗詳。爰將永綏縣之苗民風俗。擇錄數則。以餉閱者。</p>
<p>永綏縣連川屬之秀山。黔屬之松桃。及本省之保靖。鳳皇乾城等縣。按永綏民苗雜處。縣屬之上下九鄕。上下八鄕·上下十鄕等。民少苗多。語言不通。不諳客話。（官話俗謂之客話）以致政敎及他項宣傳。苗人諸多未解。現官方對於敎育特加注重。除推廣學校外。并令加習客話。以期民苗無所分别。歸於同化也。</p>
<p>苗民不信種痘。天花牛痘在在不知。故雖因有天花喪命者。苗人不惟不咎。反諉諸天命。聽其自然。</p>
<p>苗民之男女小孩。無論春夏。其頭上均戴有風兜。雖盛署亦不除去。嚴冬之際。兜旣未除。而仍赤其雙足。所謂顧頭不顧足。抑習慣使然耶。</p>
<p>永綏寸土入屯。經濟素稱落後。凡市面之行使。以及社會一般人之所信仰者。大都爲四川當百與當五十之銅元及市票。若本省之單雙銅元則不多見。即如袁頭銀幣苗人亦多有拒絶收受者。（下略）</p>
<p>永綏民苗雜處。生活異常簡單。日食二餐。在苗人則包谷甘　爲唯一養生之料此間人民。大都習於勞動。無論肩挑負販之事。男女均優爲之。且女子亦多赤足芒鞋。各自獨立而謀生計。絶無有仰給於男子者。</p>
<p>永綏苗人。居人口十之七八。漢人風俗習慣尙普通。苗人則異。聞人死僅唱孝歌舉哀。多不遵制成服。女嫁並不納采問名。僅由媒妁挿香放爆。以爲一種定婚之表現。甚有男女互相唱歌。即可藉以自由擇配者。他若春社現身龍。新年玩龍燈獅子及鞦　之類。尤爲熱閙。而苗人雖迷信鬼神。究不拜跪偶像。故凡家資稍裕者。每屆冬季。必先備牛一頭。擇定日期。縛之於柱。各以梭標剌之。名曰椎牛祭鬼。又名還儺愿。</p>
<p>苗婦生産時。亦能飲冷水。毫無危險。一苗婦必嫁數夫。方終其生。婚事不大愼重。喪事以母戚爲最尊。</p>
<p>永綏漢人女子。十四歲即不出閨門一步。男子二十加冠。開筵宴客。親戚送名字不區額以爲禮。風俗古樸。禮敎猶存。</p>

<p>在車上睡了一夜。天亮了又在車上坐了整半天。從我自己的觀點以推測到每個人的常情。我想這廂裏的同志們。也許都在沒奈何了這些無聊的光陰吧。車的四肢忽而停留。又忽而奔跑地指示我們一處處的名稱。好像是呌我們不要忘了這次雄壯的旅程。</p>
<p>陡然間汽笛又嗚嗚地如前呌了。一會兒「天津」兩個大字從我們的眼簾掠過。車體像萎頓般慢慢兒而停了。這時候窗外的人聲嘈雜。身驅魁梧的脚夫們。操着北方官話向旅客殷勤問訊。站上也有歡迎我們的同胞。衹因我們立刻又要前進。所以僅向他們感謝熱忱而已。</p>
<p>這裏本是我國有名的商業繁盛地。建設和交通都是很爲美備。帝國主義者早就埀涎欲滴了。因此白河兩岸都給他國租借。近日暴日在津門騷擾。也就是倚據我們租給他的土地來發難。然則這次天津的不幸。也是我們自種的禍根呢。</p>

<p>到了北平經過了幾天的旅途的生活，精神上總有些疲怠，但是一到了北平，却從又驚又喜的神情中把一切的不舒適的印象都遺忘得乾乾凈凈。丨丨這是心理上的一種變異。北平這個地方眞惹人憐愛啊！我見了北平的建築物，就得鄙視上海的那些八九十層的夷樓了；我聽了北平人的鄕音，就不想再聽外國有聲影片裏的歌唱了。多年不到北平來，北平的變異固然不很少，但想起了往日的游蹤，還未始不能依稀辨認。</p>
<p>工作開如等到我們認定了房屋，接洽好了一切，就開始工作。由洪深先生和張石川先生規定了一張時間表，我們大家都依從着做。每天上午六點鐘就得起身，要到下午四時才能工作完畢，似乎比在上海還要忙碌些，還要有規律些。然而，在那個時候，我們一羣人的蹤跡，幾乎被北平人視爲一種不可多得的趣味了，不必說在攝製外景的時候，露天戲塲外的觀衆常是滿立，（不是滿座（就是在我們的寓所外邊，也常使司　人應接不暇。但是我們自己呢，在忙碌的工作之餘，再也不能使無謂的交際來减我們的休憇的時間，雖然有許多不相識的朋友們很可感地來尋我們談話或攝影，我們總婉辭謝絶了「深居簡出」，丨丨在工作之餘丨丨原是在我們未來之前就决定了的計劃啊。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第三回瑜亮同來竟使筵席易散尹邢相避不知鈿盒誰遺安玉田見她如此不麻俐。臨走以前。還有這許多躭延與張致。心中自是呌苦不迭。但又拗不過伊。只好如命呌茶房快去打水。一會兒。水打來了。梁笑雲勒起兩隻袖管。露出一雙雪藕似的玉臂。到臉盆架子旁邊。慢慢的絞手巾洗面。又細細的洗了一回手。但還是不曾完。再從一隻手提皮包内掏出一個黃澄澄巧小晶瑩的粉盒。輕輕按着口上的機紐。嗤的一聲打開。現出一面小圓鏡子。旋對着鏡拈出盒裏面一個粉紅色的小粉撲。醮上些外國香粉。不住的在那吹彈得破的嬌　上。顚來竪去的細擦。好容易似乎擦匀凈了。又還拈着個小金棍兒。擠出那彈簧凸上的胭脂。向櫻唇邊又是一番輕描細點。看那些工夫。眞有說不出來的道地精緻。若是平常日子閒暇無事。安玉田從容逸豫在此靜看美人上粧倒是一種眼福。只是今天中心惴惴。念在有個李問霞就要闖到。委實沒有這種閒情。把這般眼福細享。一眼看着伊慢條斯理的只顧自家打扮。卻不管人家心裏是如何焦急。好似故意多磨時光特與人過不去的一般。直恨不得一手伸過去。就代伊把這些細巧工作。粗枝大葉的三下兩下弄完。好讓伊快快收拾過走路。可是心思白是這樣想了。不特不敢這樣鹵莽的去越俎代庖。就是想斗膽唐突一聲。再催上一句半句。也還是牙戰舌僵。哼都哼不出口。另一隻眼沒得事做。時時去偷窺書桌上的閙鐘。只見它也趁機會與人作難。長短針走得比那一天都快。轉眼間梁笑雲脂粉工夫還只做得一半。它這鐘倒約莫快走滿半個小時。這半個小時恰夠李問霞從師範大學雇車走到此地的時間。不由安玉田暗暗只呌糟透了。糟透了。這一回寃家准得碰上了頭。無可避免的了。勉强把心一橫。拚着兩面都不見好罷事到了這個危急關頭。眼見得這一暮三角式的愛情悲劇。就要啓幕。邊是準備着也上塲去如何加入表演。徒自驚惶憂急。是沒有用的了。</p>

<p>鄙人久矣沒有去看電影試片，前日蒙××影片公司惠贈請岾兩紙，因爲該公司攝製第一次有聲影片「······」業已完竣，假座卡爾登試片·我遂爲好奇心所衝動，乃於昨日（二十四）上午十一時，（請岾上十一時半我先半鐘到）驅車前往·</p>
<p>那時美國水兵，亦假座卡爾登，正在做他們「」的禮拜，還沒有完畢被邀諸同志（不是黨部同志是看戲同志）曁其愛人······只得鵠候門外，談談他們的情</p>
<p>話·</p>
<p>好容易「亞門」一聲，雙門大啓，諸男女同志遂如潮而進，各爭地盤·坐位旣定，視線集中，方冀眼福之幸臨，不料望眼將穿，周君搴幃而出·首先報告本片攝製之困難，與籌備時間的經濟·繼說：</p>
<p>「所抱歉的「······」一片，有幾段現在尙在首都檢查，還沒取到，還沒有取到，今天不能開映，請諸君明天準時駕臨××影戲院賞光云云·」</p>
<p>諸同志聽了這一番報告，莫不埀頭喪氣，口中嘖嘖不已·但我所不解的，這影片旣未到滬，何必先發請岾？即使爲經濟時間起見，預爲發出，但到那將開幕的時候，必定曉得影片沒有到了·該公司何以預先不早報告，免得同志們恭候多時，結果仍使人大大地失望·</p>
<p>并且政府機關做事，本來要趁他們的「高興」·他們「高興」就馬上檢查，他們「不高興」，躭擱十日半月，也不是希</p>
<p>罕的事·倘使現在還沒有取到，明日前往，照樣又來一趟白跑，將如何說法呢？</p>
<p>這雖是一椿區區小事，就是看不到也沒有什麽要緊，但是中國人做事，往往令人失去一種信仰心·於此可見·周君報告旣畢，另有一位先生報告：</p>
<p>「諸君請坐，不要起來，今日所收的請岾一一須重行發還」，報告旣畢開始發票·</p>
<p>詎知有一部分同志不聽報告的話，蜂擁上前，包圍發票員，大有望平街上之槪，發票員覩此情形，大呼「不發」「不發」不止，結果「急進派」達到目的，「緩和派」完全失望·</p>
<p>我看了這種情形·不免發生了一種深刻的影像·中國人不守秩序·不顧公益：已成了他們第二天性·所以隨處可以看到他們破壞秩序不顧公德的事實發生·</p>
<p>我因此得到一個小小的敎訓，破壞秩序，不顧公德的人們，權利目的完全達到，而一般保守規的尊重秩序的人，反致完全失望，假定後日再有同樣的事情發生，一般遵守秩序的人，鑑於前車，亦將同化，</p>

<h3 id="c157">談談碳氣孟復 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>炭氣是炭或炭質和氧的化合物·在化學上的名稱是二氧化炭（Ｃａｒｂｏｎ　Ｄｉｏｘｉｄｒ）公式是（Ｃｏ２）·這氣體常存在在大氣中，但是並不是多量的·大槪在鄕間曠野的地方，空氣中含有萬分之四，在都市人衆的地主，空氣中大槪含有百分之一·</p>
<p>凡燃料的燃燒，生物的呼吸，動植物的腐敗，都能發生此氣·並且在火山地帶，牠便更從地層中噴出·舉幾個例：如意大利的那不勒司附近·有一噴出碳</p>
<p>氣的地穴·美洲的黃石公園裏有一死谷（Ｄｅａｔｈ　Ｇｕｌｃｈ），生物走進便要窒息而死，因爲裏面含有多量的碳氣·不過雖然自然界裏不絶的生出二氧化炭，然而空氣中所含的數量大槪一定這就是因爲植物的葉藉了日光的力，能起一種同化作用，把吸收來的炭氣分解·分成炭和氧，吸取炭構成澱粉和炭水化合物·放出新鮮的養氣，因此空氧中的二氧化炭不致增多，如此看來，植物對於人生是很大的關係了·</p>
<p>二氧化炭是無色無嗅的氣體，比空使人窒息但是並沒有毒，更有一種特性便是石灰水能和炭氣化合，生出乳白色的沈澱，所以我們可以用此法來試騐二氧化炭：用一玻璃杯罩在燭熖上，幾分鐘後，把澄淸的石灰水傾入，然後用力振蕩，淸的石灰水就漸變成乳白色·或把我們呼出的氣吐入淸石灰水中，亦可以得着同樣的結果·假使要用化學方法來得到多量的二氧化炭，那袛要注稀鹽酸（普通都用此酸）於大理石（即炭酸鈣Ｃａｌｃｉａｍ　Ｃａｒｂｏｎａｔｅ），内即得·</p>
<p>炭酸氣的用途很廣，我把普通而重要的寫在下面：</p>
<p>㈠飲料丨夏天解署的汽水，便是利用高壓，使多量二氧化炭溶解於液中，或是用小蘇打和檸檬酸製成蘇打水，還有麥酒等都用二氧化炭，作爲淸凉有益的飲料·</p>
<p>㈡滅火丨市上所出售的滅火器，就是利用二氧化炭能隔絶養氣，且無助燃性的理由而製成·大槪的造法是如此；盛濃硫酸一小瓶，懸在重曹達（Ｓｏｄｉｕｍｂｉｃａｂｏｎａｔｅ）溶液中，設遇火災，趕快把滅火器倒置，於是小瓶撞破，兩液化合而發生炭氣，更可藉氣力把液體噴出，有時火勢雖大，竟能藉此器而奏效滬上有某滅火器製造的公司，當衆實地試騐數次，結果都很圓滿·科學眞是萬能啊！</p>
<p>㈢液態的炭氣丨二氧化炭假使降低溫度和增加壓力，牠便變成無色的液體·可把牠裝入鋼製的圓筒中，供給製造汽水等飲料的人·近時更把液態的二氧化炭，裝入鋼筒中，作爲滅火器·於是二氧化炭仍變氣體而洩出，因爲機關一開</p>
<p>，即把壓力减少，溫度增高·故液體仍舊還爲氣體·在歐美的電氣廠棉粉廠和輪船上，有的都用這種裝置了·（完）街頭社會學</p>

<p>在這種悽慘聲息中，我們就要問他們的脚爲什麽沒有了的？</p>

<p>社會上三種階級，資産階級當然生活優勝：勞働階級亦可將就：惟有長衫階級上不上，下不下，最感困難。虚僞的塲面，不能揭破。月薪的微薄，還不如工人，除去家用以外，尙有個人的消費和應酬，總是不能有餘，勉强添件衣服，難免有寅吃卯糧之虞：若皇天不佑，生下塲病，醫藥費只得向債台上設法去，再若飯碗打破，因乏人薦引，或爲顧全顔面，不肯降格爲工，那就非落魄顚沛不可。工人有了一種技藝，就不怕沒有吃飯的地方，這是工人謀生上的優點。</p>
<p>工人在中國本來是沒地位的，一向視爲「末務，」所以他們的生活最簡單。未成家的四五人合租一擱樓，已成家的四五塊錢租一亭子樓或後樓，伙食四五元，衣着三四元，每月費用，如是而已。如月入二十元已有贏餘，他們居陋，食窳，衣敝，皆沒有人過問的。（長衫階級就有人說他倒了霉了）然而自民十六革命以後，工人已佔到相當地位，工資提高不少，普通工人，可以月得四十餘元，現在仍有少數工廠的工人有加薪的要求；平心而論，工人的工作是很苦的·生活上愉快和舒服，誰不需要；其中頗有的確經騐宏富，技能高深，家口衆多的，因工資太少而感到生活不安定的痛苦；這是很希望資方酌量情形予以增加的。也頗有不少工人並無家庭負担；或雖有剩餘，消耗於不正當的支出，因之感覺工資不敷所用的，我來舉幾個例：</p>
<p>㈠某工人收入尙可，家用極省，月剩的在半數，因常往賭塲，以致負債纍</p>
<p>纍。</p>
<p>㈡某工人係獨身，並無家庭負担，但好華服裝飾，工餘外出，儼然一佳公子，因之入不敷出。</p>
<p>㈢某工人好嫖，有姘婦。</p>
<p>㈣某工廠工人，於散發工資後，揮霍無度，不待隔宿。已無剩餘。</p>
<p>㈤某女工家境平平。月入工資，可以自給·其裝飾儼如富女家，</p>
<p>我在上面所說，確是若干工人的弱點，並非誣蔑他們，更不是有意指摘。因旣發現有上述種種弱點，不忍緘默，纔很不客氣地直說出來。如果讀了以後，有則改之，無則加勉，這是我個人的希望，也就是國家社會的幸福！</p>

<p>Details Unknown, But Direction Seems Set</p>
<p>Postponement Considered for Severing Ties with Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 4 PM on the 24th, Wang convened a discussion meeting at the Lixingshe, gathering Central Committee members in Nanjing. Those present included Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Renjie, Gu Mengyu, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, Chen Gongbo, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Bijun, Qin Zhen, Chen Guofu, Ju Zheng, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, Chen Mingshu, Feng Yuxiang, Li Zongren, Li Jishen, Zhang Ji, Li Wenfan, Ma Chaojun, Zeng Zhongming, and over twenty others. A thorough study of the overall diplomatic situation was conducted. Chiang and Wang spoke most frequently during the meeting. The content was kept confidential by the committee members due to its diplomatic significance. However, according to reliable sources, regarding the Japanese issue, previous disagreements between those advocating rapid action and those advocating gradual action due to internal disunity have now been resolved by the majority of responsible personnel. It is expected that diplomatic authorities will be replaced and new representatives will be appointed. The burning of the Sanyou Company's main factory in Shanghai by Japanese individuals was also</p>
<p>discussed, but no concrete decisions were made. The meeting adjourned at 7 PM. (24th</p>
<p>Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Special Committee of the Central Political Council convened at the Lixingshe at 4 PM on the 24th. Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Chen Mingshu, Zhang Ji, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Li Jishen, Li Zongren, Feng Yuxiang, and others were present. Detailed discussions were held on important issues such as diplomacy, finance, and military affairs. The meeting adjourned around 6 PM. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9 AM on the morning of the 24th, Chiang and his wife went to Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum to pay their respects. At 10 AM, Wang visited Chiang at the mausoleum, where they discussed important diplomatic matters for a considerable time. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Lixingshe discussion meeting on the evening of the 24th, Wang told reporters that today's meeting was to prepare for the Central Standing Committee meeting tomorrow. The committee members first exchanged opinions, and before a formal decision is made, the committee members are unwilling to express their opinions individually. It is expected that important information will be released after the Central Committee meeting tomorrow. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today's meeting between Wang and Chiang at the mausoleum, and the discussions among important figures at the Lixingshe regarding diplomatic strategies, yielded no good solutions. They were speechless for a long time. As a result, it was decided to abandon the high-profile call for severing ties and first relieve Chen Youren of his duties. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain news agency, the government will continue to seek justice from the League of Nations and maintain peace in its diplomacy with Japan, postponing the severance of ties. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reliable sources, the new government's diplomatic policy, decided today, will revert to the consistent policies of the Chiang era. There will be changes in at least some of the ministers. Chiang has once again humbly declined the position of Chairman of the National Defense Committee. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Rumors of a Change in Foreign Minister <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Chen Youren Resigns Verbally to Sun</p>
<p>Luo Wengan Highly Favored as Replacement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Youren exchanged views with the British, American, and French consuls, and did not agree with the policy of severing diplomatic relations. Furthermore, the government committee members believe that declaring a severance of ties would only gain popular support without benefiting the national crisis and would prevent a proper resolution of the situation. Therefore, Chen has verbally resigned to Sun Ke and will not return from Shanghai. Additionally, the presentation of fifteen or sixteen articles of covenant to the League of Nations has not been well-received by various countries, making Chen feel even more troubled. Today, Lin Sen, Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and others consulted with Luo Wengan to seek his consent to act as Foreign Minister. Luo did not refuse outright, but stated that he feared he could not bear such a great responsibility, but he is expected to reluctantly accept. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Before leaving for Shanghai on the evening of the 23rd, Chen Youren met with American Consul Baker and told him that he would be going to Shanghai. Baker asked when he would return to Nanjing, and Chen smiled without answering. Baker predicted that Chen would not return. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Jiuguo Wanbao, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Peiping on the 22nd, emphasizing the two major issues of diplomacy and finance, stating that the only way to solve them is to first stabilize the country internally before talking about resisting foreign aggression. On the 24th, a reporter asked Chiang about this, and Chiang replied that he had not sent such a telegram and had not telegraphed Peiping before the 22nd. He stated that his return to Nanjing was entirely driven by conscience to work with his comrades to overcome the national crisis.

<p>Discussing the Policy of Ruling Manchuria and Mongolia</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military and foreign ministry officials held an important conference on the 23rd and 24th to discuss the policy towards Manchuria.

Make Manchuria and Mongolia a place where Chinese and foreign people can live in peace, and implement the open-door policy. 2. Restore Japan's special rights and interests. 3. If there is a demand for a new country, and it does not violate any treaty, it should be recognized as an independent state. (24th Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>

(23rd Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan Huijing, the Chief Representative of China attending the League of Nations Council, stated when meeting with journalists who called on him today that when the Council meets on Monday to re-discuss the Sino-Japanese Liaoning case dispute, China does not want to immediately invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to impose economic sanctions on Japan. He intends to rely on the Council itself to decide on other, most appropriate methods to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Chinese people fully support the League of Nations and hope that it can fulfill its responsibility. We now feel that the existence of the League of Nations has been shaken, so we are willing to do our best to assist the League of Nations to prove whether the League of Nations Covenant, Council resolutions, and other obligations are effective, and so on. China's great hope for a peaceful resolution lies in creating a state of tranquility so that direct negotiations can be opened on the reasons for Japan's aggression against Chinese territory. China now has 200,000 square miles of land occupied and 50,000 troops rendered ineffective.

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Mo, the former Director of the European and American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, lectured at Lixingshe at 2 PM on the 24th on what severing ties means.

However, if Country A wants to sever ties with Country B, it must first assess whether it has the strength. If it has the strength, then severing ties is not in question, as when the United States killed Italians, they severed ties immediately. If it does not have the strength and talks about severing ties, it is a path to self-destruction, which wise people do not do. We should sever ties with Japan now, but we do not have the strength, so we only declare our readiness to sever ties and cannot sever ties immediately. The matter is very clear. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e27">A Comprehensive View of the Current League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council will convene its 66th session in Geneva today. Among its thirty-odd agenda items, the Northeast issue is listed. This marks the fourth time the League has taken up this case. This fourth meeting coincides with the tense situation in Liaoning, which has spread to Shanghai, resulting in the so-called "sudden incident." Moreover, the situation is exceedingly serious. Because Shanghai is home to numerous foreign merchants and serves as an international economic center, it is naturally a matter of grave concern for members of the League of Nations. The attitude the council will adopt is also something the world will be watching with intense interest.</p>
<p>Since September 18th, our authorities' response to the Northeast issue has consistently been to trust that the League of Nations will uphold justice. Therefore, even though three meetings yielded no results, the Chinese authorities' faith in the League of Nations remains undiminished. According to a Geneva dispatch today, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, China's chief representative, told reporters, "China is unwilling to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant. We plan to continue relying on the Council to decide on other, more appropriate methods to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Chinese people wholeheartedly support the League of Nations and hope it can fulfill its responsibilities. We now feel that the League's existence is in jeopardy. Therefore, we are willing to do our utmost to assist the League to prove whether the League of Nations Covenant and the Council's resolutions are effective," and so on. From Dr. Yen's statement, it is evident that our authorities will continue to rely on the League of Nations. Not mentioning Article 16 while hoping the League will choose its own methods demonstrates utmost trust in the League. However, given the current situation, which is different from the Sino-Japanese issue during the previous three meetings, whether the League of Nations can change its attitude and find a better solution is something we cannot help but doubt. The Chinese people, seeing the ineffectiveness of the League's repeated meetings, hope the government will explore a new diplomatic path in addition to relying on the League. But the government hesitates and cannot decide. On the other hand, how does Japan, our opponent, fare? After the Tanaka cabinet resigned on November 11th last year, Inukai Tsuyoshi, as president of the Seiyukai party, came forward to form a cabinet. He appointed Yoshizawa Kenkichi, the ambassador to France and representative to the League of Nations, as the new foreign minister, and Lieutenant General Araki Sadao, known as an "expert on Russia," as the new army minister. The new cabinet unanimously adopted a tough stance and a proactive strategy towards China. The government and the military became more aligned. From then on, diplomacy and military affairs worked in tandem. It goes without saying that the policy towards China would become increasingly tense. Foreign Minister Yoshizawa returned from Siberia, and rumors of a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty suddenly grew louder. His diplomatic arrangements almost completely eliminated all international obstacles. Moreover, since September 18th, Yoshizawa had been negotiating at the League of Nations, dealing with the League with a leisurely attitude of "puffing on cigars" and "speaking slowly," leaving the League's key figures helpless. Now that Yoshizawa, who has a deep understanding of the League of Nations, has been internally appointed as Foreign Minister, we will soon see him comfortably residing in Tokyo, issuing orders, strategizing, and acting with ease in the upcoming session of the League of Nations Administrative Council.</p>
<p>As for the international atmosphere, with the Northeast issue dragging on, public opinion has become increasingly numb. Japan is taking advantage of this opportunity to focus all its efforts on eliminating the rising volunteer armies in various places in the short term, while also making every effort to promote internationally that Japan's main task in the Northeast is to "suppress bandits" and to "punish wrongdoers." Therefore, the headlines in European newspapers on the Northeast issue have recently changed from "Japan Occupies Manchuria" to "Japan Suppresses Bandits in Manchuria." It can be seen that the atmosphere in European public opinion circles has been completely enveloped by Japan's telegraphic propaganda policy. Before the Administrative Council meeting has even started, a situation of "reversal of right and wrong" and "confusion of black and white" has been created. One can already imagine what the situation will be after the meeting begins.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current international situation is revealing great crises everywhere. On the one hand, since German Chancellor Brüning announced Germany's inability to repay its debts, the issue of canceling reparations has become the focus of European and American international affairs. After the Lausanne Conference was thwarted by France, the issue of reparations reached a stalemate. European and American authorities are racking their brains and unable to find a solution. The global economic panic is expanding and cannot be remedied. On the other hand, the disarmament conference is about to open. Although the major powers talk about reducing armaments every day, they continue to expand their military preparations. They have no sincerity in disarmament. These two events are enough to prove that the world is in a crisis of extreme contradictions. The major powers are constantly perplexed, trying to save the situation and busy planning for their own survival. How can we expect them to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue in the League of Nations meeting? Therefore, our country's continued desire to rely on the League of Nations today is something to think deeply about.</p>

However, Director Zhang's intention to resign was firm and could not be reversed. Minister Huang also urged him to take office because customs affairs urgently need someone to preside over them, so he reluctantly took office today. Customs duties are the largest source of income for our country, and customs administration is particularly related to the people's livelihood and national economy.

<p>The Sino-Japanese Case Occupies One of the Important Agendas</p>
<p>French Representative Poncet May Serve as Chairman</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 24th - French representative to the League of Nations, Mr. Poncet, will serve as chairman of the Administrative Council and will arrive here this afternoon with the country's representative, Mr. Massigli. The Administrative Council will hold its first meeting at 11:00 tomorrow morning. According to the agenda, this session will be extremely heavy, and the issues it will discuss will include all matters within the purview of the League of Nations, no less than forty-one items. However, two of these issues are most important. The first is the report of the economic experts, and the second is the Sino-Japanese conflict. Regarding the report of the economic experts, the Administrative Council will likely make a decision in principle regarding this recommendation. As for the Sino-Japanese conflict, it is still unknown whether China will invoke Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. If it invokes this article, the legal basis for the Administrative Council's actions will change. Conversely, if China does not invoke this article, the Administrative Council will simply file the organization of the investigation team and await its report. Even if China invokes Article 15, the Administrative Council may not take any new actions, because according to this article, the League of Nations must first send personnel to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The United States Concerned About the Situation in Shanghai <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Commander of the Asian Fleet Has Discretionary Power</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 24th - The fact that the Japanese Marines are planning to land in Shanghai may lead to incidents and cause difficulties between Japan and the powers. Officials here are paying close attention to this matter. Secretary of State Stimson is now in New York, and Deputy Secretary of State Castle is discussing the situation with President Hoover. Because the US government does not want to be drawn into the whirlpool of the Far East disputes, it is eager to be cautious and has not ordered the commander of the navy in Manila to send warships to Shanghai, but the Navy Department has ordered the commander to assess the situation and handle it with full authority. The Shanghai Public Concession already has US Marines stationed there, and the commander can increase its strength if he deems it necessary.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 23rd - The concern here about the situation in Shanghai has lessened slightly today, because the consulate received a telegram saying that Japanese naval commander Shiozawa had promised not to take any action in the Public Concession without first consulting the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd - Deputy Secretary of State Castle expressed great attention to the situation in Shanghai, saying that the US Consul General in Shanghai has broad freedom to deal with any issues that may involve the United States.</p>

<p>Property Confiscated by the State</p>
<p>Barcelona Declares General Strike</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 23rd - President Zamora signed an order today dissolving the Spanish Society of Jesus. The battle between the Spanish Republican government and the Catholic Church has thus taken another step. The reason for the dissolution is that members must swear allegiance to the Holy See, and the Republic is not mentioned. The new order deprives members of the Society of Jesus of their legal rights, limits them to abandon church life within ten days, prohibits them from disposing of property, and all property is confiscated by the state for charitable purposes. Churches of the Society that have no members to manage them should be handed over to the districts where they are located.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 23rd - The Minister of the Interior today petitioned the National Assembly to allow the allocation of 100,000 pounds sterling to purchase military supplies and trucks, and to increase the police and storm troopers by 2,500 to curb riots. This proves the seriousness of the current situation in Spain.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 23rd - The Spanish government is still engaged in suppressing the rebel party. Barcelona has declared a general strike. Armed police are patrolling the streets. All roads leading to the city are heavily guarded. Those entering the city are subject to strict inspection. Other towns are also on alert in the same way. Cars passing the police station in Barcelona have been requisitioned. The police arrested 27 party members who were meeting at the headquarters of the Communist Party. Malaga has returned to normal. The strikers in Corunna have decided to resume work.</p>
<p>Havas, Barcelona, 23rd - Since Barcelona declared a general strike, 800 dockworkers stopped working this morning, and workers on ships also went on strike at noon. Transportation is completely paralyzed. Most shops are still open. Radicals are forcing most factories to stop work. In the afternoon, the situation changed, traffic returned to normal, theaters opened, and newspapers will be published in the evening. The Public Security Bureau is strict but extremely cautious. It has arrested some troublemakers and trade union members. The railway has not gone on strike. The garrison commander declared that the mountains near Figueres were occupied by the army this morning without resistance. It is expected that major factories can resume work on Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The German Chancellor Responds to the National Socialist Party <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Current Situation is Caused by the Treaty</p>
<p>Willing to Exhaust My Intelligence to Break the Current National Crisis</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - National Socialist Party leader Hitler previously wrote to Chancellor Brüning, opposing the extension of President Hindenburg's term by amending the constitution. Brüning has now responded, and the full text was published here tonight. The letter refuses to discuss the National Socialist Party's claims with Hitler and refutes Hitler's argument that the country's pain is due to party strife, saying that Hitler ignores the Treaty of Versailles and the victorious interpretations of the treaty within five years after the European War, which undermined Germany's various efforts to rehabilitate, leading to the depreciation of the German currency and even greatly harming national unity. At that time, thanks to the unity of all levels, regardless of party affiliation, and cooperation to defend against foreign troubles, the division was avoided. Today's situation cannot be attributed to individuals, nor can it be attributed to a party. All of it is due to the fact that the enemies of the past and the creditors of today still do not realize that the conditions imposed on Germany are based on emotion and do not take into account the facts, and forget that rich juice cannot be extracted from dry fruit. If this remains unchanged, the overall situation will not improve in the end. Then, it discusses the world economic storm, which is far-reaching, and Germany cannot be exempted, of course. He hopes that Hitler will not discuss things from the prejudice of political parties, that even if today's government is composed of Hitler's comrades, it must recognize this fact and carry out the policies implemented by the current government. He did not say that the government was entrusted by the president and is willing to exhaust its intelligence to fulfill its responsibilities. The only purpose now is to save the motherland from disaster. Everyone can judge our achievements according to their degree, but no one is allowed to doubt our sincerity.</p>

<p>Committee Established New Agreement</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 23rd - The committee discussing Germany's short-term debt has agreed that the existing payment relief agreement, which expires on February 29, should be extended for another year. The committee expressed its agreement with the bank experts who gathered in Basel to discuss Germany's donation rate, which has now reached its maximum limit, and declared that Germany has recognized its implementation of a regular and stable method of debt payment through goods and clearing, but its export opportunities for goods have now been limited due to the abolition of the gold standard in several countries. The committee's report mentioned the competition among countries around the world for the declining world trade, saying that trade policy should allow the flow of goods to pay off international debts. Countries should destroy trade barriers, open markets, and facilitate each other. The report also praised the great efforts and sacrifices made by Germany's government and people to maintain their position in extremely difficult circumstances. It is noted that the short-term debt related to this new agreement totals about 268 million pounds sterling. German banks have now issued a statement stating that the payment relief agreement has been extended for one year, until February 28, 1933, but Germany must legislate to approve the implementation of the existing agreement, otherwise foreign creditors may abolish the agreement. It is noted that the new agreement stipulates that 200 million marks in cash be borrowed from German banks and converted into ten-year loans. Each year, German banks will pay 15% of foreign debt into the trust fund of the German National Bank, and the German National Bank will issue 10% of securities to creditors. This is the first step in changing short-term debt into long-term loans.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - Last year, the volume of German industrial products decreased greatly. Germany has dropped to fourth place in the world industrial countries. It is noted that in 1928, Germany ranked second, after the United States. Now, the second place has been seized by Soviet Russia. Britain now ranks third, behind Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>The Other Party Can Declare the Treaty Void When Attacking a Third Country</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 23rd - The full text of the Soviet-Finnish Mutual Non-Aggression Treaty was published here today and is slightly different from what was reported in Europe and is somewhat unconventional. One of the most noteworthy articles is that if one of the contracting countries attacks a third country, the other party can declare the treaty void without prior notice. The two contracting countries guarantee each other's borders, territorial integrity, and political independence, and promise not to attack each other in any form. If one party is attacked by another country, the other party shall strictly maintain neutrality. Both parties also promise not to participate in any treaties, agreements, or alliances that are unfavorable to the other party. If disputes arise between the two countries that cannot be resolved through ordinary diplomatic channels, they shall be submitted to a mixed arbitration committee for judgment. Before the treaty is ratified, an arbitration treaty will be concluded separately. The validity period of this treaty is set at three years.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Rome, 23rd - Japanese naval Vice Admiral Nagano Osami and army Lieutenant General Matsui Iwane, representatives to the Disarmament Conference, suddenly landed in Naples this morning and took a special car specially prepared by the Italian government directly to Rome. The Japanese representatives were originally scheduled to land in Marseille and transfer to Geneva via Paris. Now, they have suddenly changed their route to Rome, so there is a lot of speculation from the outside world. After arriving at the hotel, Nagano, Matsui, etc. met with many Italian journalists, but their words were very cautious. Matsui even claimed that Japan is the most powerful country in maintaining world peace, so Japan will also do its best at this Disarmament Conference to make the conference a success, but other countries must also have the same reduction before it can be said.</p>

<p>Having an Affair with a Maid and Abandoning Her</p>
<p>The Police Department Leaks Secrets as a Tool for Political Struggle</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 24th - Hirokawa, a 22-year-old girl living with Yoshiwaka in Reigan Town, Kyobashi Ward, suddenly took hypnotic drugs at 5:00 am yesterday in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was discovered by her family and was not fatally injured. The girl confessed the truth after being questioned by the Kyobashi Ward Police Station, saying that in September of Showa 4, she was a maid in the home of Minister of Railways Jiangmu, and she had a relationship with Jiangmu, almost in the same status as a concubine. Unexpectedly, Jiangmu not only did not give her material or spiritual treatment, but suddenly dismissed her. She had no choice but to wish to die for him. According to the girl's description, the Metropolitan Police Department immediately distributed printed materials, but each party believed that such family secret cases should be strictly kept secret and should not be announced publicly. Now, because of party relations and the period of the general election struggle, the director-general disregards his image and uses the topic to attack as a means of attack, thus arousing criticism from the outside world. In addition to strongly denying the adultery, Minister Jiangmu believes that the behavior of Hasegawa, the director-general of the Metropolitan Police Department, in announcing the scandal and distributing printed matter to the press corps, is an abnormal action. Therefore, Minister of the Interior Nakahashi specially consulted with Vice-Minister Kawarada and Police Security Bureau Director Morioka at 11:30 tonight on the words and deeds of Director-General Hasegawa, and there will be a serious expression.</p>

<p>Since the appearance of the Soviet Union, a socialist republic, in the golden world of capitalism, this world has immediately become exceptionally uneasy. The defenders of capitalism have naturally resorted to extreme slander, persecution, and even the general conservative masses harbor deep doubts about it. In short, in the eyes of the world, the Soviet Union is merely a strange monster, a frightening poison, as unapproachable as a flood or a ferocious beast.</p>
<p>For example, when the great British writer George Bernard Shaw recently visited the Soviet Union from England, his relatives cried as if it were a final farewell when he decided to set off, begging him not to risk his life. But he insisted on going. Unable to stop him, they sent him many packages of food, bedding, tents, and everything he might need. They all thought that Shaw would definitely starve in the Soviet Union and would not be able to find food or lodging. What a comical scene! At the same time, the depth of the world's suspicion and misunderstanding of the Soviet Union is as if it were an unknown land in the present world, simply regarded as a dark continent, another immeasurable world. We can just imagine it. However, in this world, the Soviet Union is indeed a strange country. Because the existence and development of the Soviet Union make the capitalist countries feel a huge threat, and even cast an extremely dark and tragic net on the future of capitalist life. Everyone holds hatred for this traitor of the capitalist world, considering it an enemy with which they cannot coexist. Therefore, at the beginning of the Soviet revolution, various countries implemented an economic blockade and armed repression against it, surrounding it on all sides, making Moscow a dangerously isolated city. From 1919 to 1921, the Soviet Union was constantly in arduous battles. After several years of struggle, the Soviet Union finally broke through the siege, laid the cornerstone of socialism, and further shook the rule of capitalism. On these two battle lines, the struggle between capitalist and non-capitalist countries is becoming increasingly sharp and fierce. Because of the deep jealousy and hatred of capitalist countries towards the Soviet Union, their fabrication of rumors, slander, and destruction are becoming increasingly unscrupulous. And the truth about the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly difficult for the world to understand. For more than a decade, the world has only had cruel criticism of the Soviet Union, saying things like "This is an enemy of humanity!" or "This is a disturber of peace!" This has been shouted all over the capitalist world. In fact, in the Soviet Union, although people may not get a very abundant supply, there is no contradiction between living an extremely affluent life on the one hand, while enduring hunger, cold, and poverty on the other. In particular, there is no fact of burning surplus products without distributing them to hungry and cold citizens. Although most people work long hours, there is no contradiction between sitting idly and exploiting the blood and sweat of others on the one hand, while being used as oxen, horses, and slaves on the other. All benefits are enjoyed equally by the masses, and all hardships are borne equally by the masses. Everyone is working hard towards an ideal goal.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the face of the economic depression throughout the world, every capitalist country is at a loss, even the Washington government of the golden country is no exception. Recently, a chart of the current world economic situation compiled by Kiichi Higashikawa of the Japan News Alliance, entitled "Where is the World Going?", reveals various types of unemployment as follows:</p>
<p>"During the boom of the European War, there were so-called shipping upstarts everywhere, because at that time, no matter how broken a ship was, it had a surprising value. But now, even very beautiful ships are showing their red bellies and becoming idle ships. Britain currently has 2.04 million tons of idle ships, almost one-tenth of all ships in Britain. Japan has 310,000 tons. The United States has 2.66 million tons. ... Speaking of shipyards, every country is in a state of semi-shutdown or complete shutdown. ...</p>
<p>"As of August 1, 1931, there were 5.1 million unemployed people in the United States. It is feared that this number will increase to 7 million by winter. ... The number of unemployed people in Germany in the winter of 1931 may also exceed 6 million. "It is not just people, ships, and machines that are unemployed. Capital is also unemployed, hiding in the vaults of banks and yawning. Because of unemployment, business is done with extra caution. Therefore, long-term loans have particularly high interest rates and even more stringent conditions. ......"</p>
<p>Other issues include the decline in purchasing power, the contraction of credit, the instability of currency, the heavy burden of debt, and the depression of industry. The wailing of the world's hungry and cold masses has already echoed through the clouds. Only the Soviet Union stands outside this circle of recession. Every citizen is working diligently with infinite hope and infinite joy.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw would never lie. When he visited the Soviet Union and returned to Berlin, he solemnly told reporters, "If you have seen with your own eyes what Bolshevism is in that place, then you will definitely feel that capitalism is about to perish." Last July 31, at the grand celebration in Moscow held by all Soviet public organizations and literary groups for his 75th birthday, he also said, "I feel that all aspects of your country have a new atmosphere. If you go to the Western countries to find this new atmosphere, you will definitely be disappointed." Shaw's words should not deceive us.</p>
<p>Similarly, Dr. Eddy, an American and an ardent Christian, has visited the Soviet Union four times since the revolution. In his recent book, The Truth About Soviet Russia, he said, "No other country is like the Soviet Union in wanting to provide for the needs of its people by relying on its own statistics and using all its energy, and in wanting to make the various parts of the national economy, in terms of production and consumption, match the needs of the people."</p>
<p>Another example is Hoover, a conservative economics professor at Lincoln University in the United States, who, as a member of the Social Science Research Council, wrote the following passage after a long period of observation in the Soviet Union: "The people of the world are either completely ignorant or spreading misinformation about the progress of one of the greatest economic and social experiments in human history. ... At the present time, it is futile and unwise for the United States to suppress the small number of Communists, to crack down on Communist propaganda with harsh laws, and to arrest Communist agitators with the force of the police. ... It is very important to recognize the genuine activities of the Soviet Union and to decide to adapt the materials of all Soviet experiments to the needs of our own country. ... If the capitalist system does not find a way to greatly improve the living standards of the lowest working class, and at the same time cannot reconcile international economic competition, then a militant and fanatical Soviet-style communism may break down the gates of Berlin in the next ten years." (See Chapter 1 of Eddy's The Truth About Soviet Russia)</p>
<p>Then, we should be able to find the answers from the above words regarding whether the Soviet Union's political system is good or bad, and whether its economic system is rational or unreasonable.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Yan Xishan's Recent Words and Actions <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams Urge Chiang, Hu, and Wang to Go to Nanjing</p>
<p>Wu Peifu to Arrive in Datong</p>
<p>Jing Yuesiu Visits Yan</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Recently, Zhao Pilian came with a central government mandate, and also advised Yan to go to Nanjing. Therefore, rumors of Yan's return to public life spread for a time. It is said that Zhao brought with him a letter from Sun Ke, President of the Executive Yuan, to Yan, inviting Yan to share the affairs of the country. After Yan read the letter, he immediately telegraphed Chiang, Wang, and Hu, also hoping that Chiang and others would go to Nanjing as soon as possible. The original telegram said, "I recently received a letter from Mr. Zhesheng stating that the state of the country is such that comrades here, all</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>believe that at this time the only thing to do is to urge Mr. Hu, Wang, and Chiang to come to Nanjing together, to preside over the central government, and to seek internal peace first, before we can resist foreign aggression, etc., I have read and reread this and it has truly won my heart. Indeed, the country and the party are in imminent danger, and unless the entire party is united and of one mind, the disaster of destruction cannot be avoided. The three gentlemen are pillars of the party and the country, and all are in awe. At this time of national turmoil, we especially rely on their wisdom to work together to save the situation. I earnestly hope that you will go to Nanjing as soon as possible to share the heavy burden. In times of difficulty, the country will prosper, and perhaps there will be a solution. My humble sincerity is difficult to express in full. In my telegram, my mind is with you, and I am anxious to see you. Yan Xishan respectfully."</p>
<p>According to people who recently came from Hebian, Yan's recent attitude is that he has not expressed any concrete opinions on the Northwest Political Affairs Committee, but</p>
<p>he feels quite distressed about the evil phenomena of past oligarchical politics and cyclical wars in his conversations. Recently, Yan has been paying attention to plans such as the Ten-Year Self-Strengthening and National Salvation Plan. If he cannot avoid yielding to the urging of various parties in the future, he will start from the lower levels to thoroughly create a genuine democratic government. It is said that Yan has also been paying close attention to education and finance recently.</p>
<p>Wang Ping, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, went to Hebian Village the other day to ask Yan for instructions on the issue of the People's Court's interrogation. Zhao Pilian also arrived and, after joint consultation, it was decided to send a telegram urging Chairman Xu to return to the province immediately, and Yan sent Zhang Zhijie to Pingmian to urge him to return to Shanxi. The Provincial Government received a telephone call from Wang Ping from Hebian yesterday (the 20th), stating this matter, and saying that the telegram urging Xu had already been sent from Hebian.</p>
<p>News that Wu Peifu was about to pass through Datong to Beijing spread like wildfire recently. Yan received a telegram from Fu Zuoyi yesterday, saying that Wu had arrived in Linhe on the 18th and would arrive in Baotou today (the 20th). Wu also telegraphed Yan, reporting his itinerary, saying, "To Marshal Yan: With respect to your brother's achievements, I have respectfully learned of your telegram. I trust that your illness is improving without the need for medication. Thinking of you. Your brother arrived at Shizuishan, and it happened that [someone] was able to come to Linhe, and sent a car to wait, and condescended to meet in Datong. I am deeply grateful and comforted. The rest is fully expressed. I especially reply and hope you are aware. Wu Peifu respectfully."</p>
<p>Jing Yuesiu, commander of the Fourth Division of Northern Shaanxi, came to Taiyuan the other day. The reporter drove to visit him this morning and was received by Liu Shaoting. According to him, Commander Jing first went to Hangzhou for sightseeing after attending the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Beijing. After staying in Shanghai for several days, he went north and stayed in Beiping for about twenty days. He then returned to Shaanxi via Suiyuan, and took the opportunity to inspect the troops stationed in various parts of northern Shaanxi. Because the bandit situation in Lingzhong, on the border between Shaanxi and Suiyuan, was rampant, and the soldiers and bandits were fighting, making the road difficult to travel, he changed to a car to Taiyuan. The car went to Xinzhou and then to Hebian to visit Yan. In addition to reporting the course of this trip, he also discussed the development of industries in the Northwest. It is said that Jing believes that if industries in the Northwest are to be developed, roads must first be built to facilitate transportation. It is now decided to first build a long-distance highway from Yulin, one from Yulin via Fugu directly to Suiyuan, and one from Yulin to Liulin Town in Lishi, western Shanxi, connecting with the long-distance highway in western Shanxi, so as to directly reach Taiyuan. This plan can be started after returning to Shaanxi. As for the industries in northern Shaanxi, it is planned to first develop the oil in Yanchang County and the salt in Shenmu County. All plans have also been discussed in detail with Yan, and Yan greatly praised them. Jing will return to Shaanxi in two or three days. (January 21)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Liu Guitang's Troops Decide to Form a Division <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Regarding the reorganization of Liu Guitang's troops, at 2:00 p.m. today, Liu's representatives Xia Ziming, Li Ziming, and Zuo Ganqing went to the Provincial Government again to meet with Han Fuqu to discuss everything. Xia put forward several requests: 1) Please grant Liu Guitang's title so that he can lead his subordinates. Han immediately agreed that if Liu's troops had 5,000 rifles and moved to the north bank of the Yellow River, he would immediately announce him as the division commander and would not break his promise. (According to reports, Liu currently has more than 6,000 men with complete rifles.) 2) Regarding the issue of military uniforms, Xia requested that another 4,000 sets be issued. Han said that they were being rushed, and more than a thousand sets could be made ready by tomorrow afternoon and transported to Dawenkou for distribution. 3) Regarding the issue of military pay, Han said that it would be paid at the end of the month at the same time as the Third Route Army. 4) Regarding the issue of departure, Han said that today Gu Liangmin, commander of the 22nd Division, forwarded another telegram from Liu Guitang, requesting to march on foot to Gaotang after receiving the military uniforms in full, but it is extremely difficult to supply food and provisions along the way by marching on foot, and the request to march on foot is nothing more than distrust of me. Now I have decided to order Senior Advisor Cheng Xixian to travel ahead by car. If there are any changes, of course Cheng will be the first to suffer, as a guarantee. 5) Regarding the issue of Zhang Heilian's troops leaving the mountains, Xia said that Zhang's troops were eager to surrender, but they were intercepted by the Yishui militia and could not leave the mountains. Please issue an order to let them pass so that they can leave the mountains. Han said that after those in Dawenkou depart, those with names will be ordered to surrender and reorganize, and those without names will not be accepted. The results of the negotiations were quite satisfactory. Han also kept Xia and others for dinner at the Provincial Government, and again agreed that at 2:30 p.m. on the 23rd, Cheng Xixian, Xia Ziming, Li Ziming, Zuo Ganqing and others would escort the military uniforms to Dawenkou for distribution, and give instructions to Liu's troops, and consult with Liu on the issue of departure. It is said that Han still wants them to depart by car. (January 23)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Resolution of the Fuzhou Military-Civilian Conflict Case <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Huian Again Incites Great Change Due to Levying Tobacco Tax</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Although the military-civilian conflict in Fuqing County was stopped by Liu Jun, the regimental commander of the Second Regiment of the Second Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Forces, who led the You Baoying and Li Yunrong rain battalions, Lin Jing, the captain of the Second Independent Detachment of the Provincial Defense Forces, demanded compensation of 250,000 yuan because his troops lost two battalion's worth of military equipment and more than thirty battalion, company, and platoon leaders were killed in action during the incident. The Rescue Township Corps of Gaoshan and Longtian towns, however, argued that the villages had been repeatedly looted by Lin's troops and were unbearably trampled on. Unless they were transferred, the local area would never have peace. Both sides went to extremes and could not be resolved. Various groups in Fuqing County then sent Chen Ruyi and others to the province to petition the Security Office of the Provincial Government, requesting a swift resolution to avoid another war and further devastation of the local area. The Provincial Government then put forward a discussion at the committee meeting on the 19th, believing that Lin Jing had repeatedly harassed the local area and repeatedly ignored warnings, which was a violation of military discipline. It was decided to dismiss him from his post for investigation, and the troops under his command were to be separately reorganized by the Second Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Forces. If there were any who fled to various places, the local garrison and militia were allowed to intercept and disarm them at any time. As for the post-disaster matters in Fuqing, Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the Provincial Committee, and Zhou Xiaopei, the brigade commander of the Second Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Forces, were recommended to handle the matter properly. As soon as Lin Jing heard the news, he led his troops out of the county seat at 12:00 that evening, taking the road to Dongzhang Town and intending to go to Yongtai. Upon receiving the report, Liu Jun immediately led the You and Li battalions to pursue and attack, killing more than fifty people, capturing more than sixty people, and seizing more than a hundred guns. Lin Jing led the remnants to escape to Yongtai. On the 20th, the Provincial Government had telegraphed the Yongtai garrison Huang Bingwu's troops to intercept them. The Fuqing incident was finally resolved. However, the troops of Chen Guohui of the Second Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Forces stationed in Huian County shot and killed eight farmers and seriously injured more than ten farmers in Batou Township in the northern district of the county on the 15th of this month due to the forced imposition of a tobacco seedling tax, which aroused public outrage. More than ten thousand people immediately gathered to surround and disarm Chen's troops and destroy the Measurement Bureau (the agency in charge of the tobacco seedling tax). Upon receiving the news, Chen Guohui immediately transferred a large team from Quanzhou to suppress them. The two sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Upon receiving the report, the Provincial Government telegraphed yesterday to stop it. (January 21)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Wuhan Disaster Victims Given Deadline to Move Out of the Urban Area <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: According to recent investigations, there are indeed more than 300,000 disaster victims in Wuhan, most of whom are elderly, weak, women, and children, and their suffering is even greater. This is because the young and strong have gradually moved elsewhere to make a living on their own. The elderly, weak, women, and children have no work to do, so they have nowhere to return. Their living difficulties are especially pitiful. They eat chaff and wear rags. They live in streets and alleys. Under the wind and snow, hundreds and thousands of people sell their wives and children, which is common everywhere. The hell on earth is probably not enough to describe their suffering. Recently, the Post-Disaster Relief Committee, in view of the large number of disaster victims, decided that not only are the relief funds too small to be sustainable, but also fears that bandits will mix in and affect public security. It was decided to issue relief once and no longer issue it in the future, and a new relief area was designated, requiring all disaster victims to move there, otherwise the military and police agencies would enforce it. The Pacification Office, the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the Hubei Flood Relief Committee, and the Hubei Provincial Government jointly issued a notice limiting the time from the 23rd to the end of the month, to completely move out of the urban area within a week. The notice is as follows: "The principle of investigating and handling relief is that it is better to disperse than to gather. Moreover, during the winter defense period, with hundreds of thousands of disaster victims gathered in Wuhan, it is difficult to guarantee that bandits will not mix in and attempt to do wrong. However, the situation of the genuine disaster victims is extremely pitiful. Therefore, in the absence of a way to handle it, we have devised a two-pronged approach. It has been decided to move the existing disaster victims in the three towns of Wuchang, Hanyang, and Xia to a place farther away from the city. On the one hand, the place is remote to avoid mixing, and on the other hand, the situation is scattered to avoid crowding. Seven articles have been discussed and decided, listed below. This is to ensure the thorough relief purpose and the safety and order of the local area, and we will do what we say. Disaster victims must comply with it without violation. 1) The originally announced relief of 20 catties of wheat per disaster victim will now be issued half by the committee within a week, and the remaining 10 catties will be issued at the newly designated location. 2) No relief will be given in Wuhan in the future. 3) The winter relief of this committee will be suspended. 4) A new relief location has been designated, but no shelter will be built. Those who have already lived in the shelters of this committee can freely dismantle and move them, but they must not dismantle them arbitrarily, causing disputes. 5) The new relief location, such as those originally in the Hushan area of Hanyang, will be designated as the area between Caidian and Xinglongji under the jurisdiction of the county. Those in Hankou will be designated as the area between Hengdian and Qijiawan under the jurisdiction of Huangpi. Those in Hongshan, Meijiashan, Luojiashan, Changchun Guan, and various places in the provincial capital will be designated as the area near Jinkou under the jurisdiction of Wuchang. Although the relocation will not be out of the above areas, the disaster victims can choose an area closer to their original place of origin to move into, so that it will be easier to return to their hometowns in the future. 6) The newly built places will be requested by the committee to the Pacification Office to dispatch troops to be stationed there permanently for protection. 7) From the date of the notice, the victims will be limited to seven days to move to the new relief location. Those who refuse to move will be forcibly enforced by the military and police. (January 21)</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Calamity of War and Banditry in Huangpi <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Huangpi was previously attacked by rampant bandits, and the county seat was in imminent danger. After the suppression by various armies, the banditry gradually subsided. However, before they could catch their breath, Li Mingzhong's troops suddenly changed, and the inside and outside of the city suffered considerable losses. Even now, order has not been restored. At the same time, the bandit forces have returned after their departure. If there is an opportunity, the future disaster is still unknown. Therefore, the course of the mutiny and the current situation of the Red bandits are recorded as follows, according to what I have heard. First, the Red bandits attacked the city and were defeated, and fled back to</p>
<p>Huang'an. The troops that came to suppress them were mostly temporarily conscripted, each with its own defense area. After the bandits left, they returned to their defense areas. Huangpi County was still guarded by Li Mingzhong's troops of the 30th Division. The brigades of Li's division have always been uncoordinated, and Li has not been to the army for a long time. Wang Zhenhuai, Chief of Staff of the Governor's Office, acted on his behalf. Recently, the local clans changed the brigade commander of a certain brigade, and the rift became more apparent. The disaster occurred on the 17th. In the beginning of the incident, a small part of Li's Special Service Brigade opened the east gate of the county seat and fled towards Macheng. At dawn on the 18th, the 88th and 89th Brigades rushed to Huangpi from Huang'an and completely disarmed the troops of the Special Service Brigade that had not yet left the city. In the afternoon of the same day, soldiers inside and outside the city clashed, and at the same time, more than a hundred stores were looted. After Wang Zhenhuai and others tried their best to suppress them, they gradually subsided. However, until the 20th, the city gates had not been opened, and the stores had not resumed business. A certain councilor sent by the Pacification Office and Liu Weiyuan, the newly appointed magistrate of Huangpi, had both arrived at the county seat and had been meeting with Chief of Staff Wang of the Governor's Office and local gentry and businessmen for days to discuss post-disaster matters. Local order will be restored within days. As for Li Mingzhong, who was recuperating in Wuhan, he refused to see guests from the time the incident occurred. The next day, he took a boat to Shanghai for recuperation. The position of Commander of the 30th Division was taken over by Peng Zhenshan, sent by the Pacification Office, and the position of Deputy Commander was held concurrently by Wang Cibai, commander of the 22nd Route Special Service Brigade. The Governor's Office was still acting on behalf of Wang Zhenhuai. At the time of the mutiny, the bandits who had fled back to Huang'an thought there was an opportunity and made a comeback, causing Changxuanling, Baishuigang, Chenjiawan, Liujiaqiao, Wangjiahe, Hengshan, Luohan Temple, and Xilijiaji to become bandit areas again. According to people from Huangpi, the Red bandits conscripted young farmers into the Red Guards wherever they went, and conscripted old and weak women and children into the basket teams. The Red Guards were the vanguard, and the formal Red Army was the cover. Therefore, when the army suppressed the bandits, most of those who died were genuine farmers, and the Red Army suffered less losses. At the moment, the main force of the bandits is in Wanshan Temple and Changlinggang in the northeast, and the pseudo-Soviet government is set up in Hekou, at the junction of Beixiangwei and Huang'an and Luoshan in Henan. With Changlinggang, Baliawan, Pujiazhai, and Caijiawan as corners, the situation is extremely consolidated. If the bandit lair is not quickly destroyed, it is feared that it will eventually become a problem on the border between Hubei, Henan, and Anhui. (January 21)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Abrupt Decrease in the Number of Emigrants from Chao and Shan <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Last year saw a reduction of more than half compared to the year before.</p>
<p>Shantou correspondence: The population of Chaozhou and Meizhou is prolific, and approximately 150,000 to 160,000 people migrate to the Nanyang Islands each year. Since 1928, Nanyang has been affected by the global economic downturn, leading to sluggish sales of local products, a daily increase in unemployed workers, soaring exchange rates, and tepid commerce in various ports. On August 1, 1930, the British colonial government of Singapore issued an order prohibiting the entry of Chinese laborers. Initially, it permitted the entry of 2,321 individuals per month, limited to the four ports of Xiamen, Hong Kong, Haikou, and Shantou. On October 1, 1931, the quota for Chinese entry was further reduced to 1,160. Shantou received only 400 passenger tickets per month among the four ports. Due to the restricted number of passenger tickets, various shipping companies diverted their ships to other ports. It is reported that starting on the first of this month, Singapore will continue to issue the seventh restriction order on the entry of Chinese laborers. This is the biggest blow suffered by our country's immigrants to Nanyang and a great misfortune for those from Chaozhou and Meizhou seeking a livelihood.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Dutch East Indies has increased the entry tax for Chinese, curbing the entry of Chinese laborers. Ten years ago, Chinese going to Batavia and the Java Islands initially paid a landing tax of 25 guilders per person. This was later increased to 50 guilders, then to 100 guilders in 1929, and further increased to 150 guilders starting on April 1, 1931. Moreover, it must be carried with the individual and paid upon landing, otherwise landing is not permitted. Even after paying the tax, a stamp of guarantee from local businesses is still required for the individual to freely engage in employment and seek a livelihood. Since the promulgation of this rule, those from Chaozhou and Meizhou seeking a livelihood in the Dutch territories are almost in dire straits.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is the new immigration regulation issued by the Siamese government on August 1, 1930. Starting in November, all Chinese entering the country must pay a tax of 80 baht per person. Those who have not obtained a local exit passport or proven their nationality will not be allowed to enter. Furthermore, an annual head tax of 10 baht must be paid. After the implementation of this rule, the burden on the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Siam has become heavier, and it has become more difficult to make a living.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Annam (Vietnam), Saigon, also promulgated new regulations last year. All new arrivals must pay a landing license fee of 15 yuan at the New Immigrant Office. However, this license is not valid in areas such as Hanoi. Restrictions on the movement of overseas Chinese are very strict. In addition to paying the head tax each year, Chinese must also pay a remittance tax, making it almost impossible for them to sustain themselves.</p>
<p>In summary, the Chinese government is indifferent to these various situations. Without effective relief, overseas Chinese are unable to unite and improve their environment. Last year, Shantou frequently received unemployed Chinese laborers deported from various parts of Nanyang. Their gaunt and discolored appearance was extremely miserable. These returning overseas Chinese were mostly sent back to their hometowns with half-fare tickets for boats and trains, obtained from the municipal government through the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society. It is reported that last year, due to soaring exchange rates, overseas Chinese remittances back to Shantou were approximately 40 million yuan, compared to over 50 million yuan in the previous year. Based on the amount of exchange rates, the foreign capital flowing into the interior decreased by more than half last year (the value of one Singapore dollar was 1.4 yuan in national currency the previous year, while it was 2.2 to 2.6 yuan last year). This issue is of great importance to the livelihood of the people of Chaozhou and Meizhou. This is because many of those who remitted money back to Shantou last year were small-scale overseas Chinese capitalists who, unable to operate in Nanyang, sold off their existing</p>
<p>productive enterprises and returned with the funds, which is not comparable to the previous year when most remittances were from workers supporting their families. It is reported that in 1930, the number of people leaving Shantou for Nanyang was 115,791, and the number returning to the country was 93,767. After various places restricted the entry of Chinese laborers in 1931, the number of overseas Chinese departing from Shantou was</p>
<p>58,238, and the number returning to the country was 65,866, which is the opposite. There is an unprecedented situation where the number of entries exceeds the number of exits. This is a serious problem today. (17th day)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Financial Urgency in Zhenjiang <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang is located at the intersection of north and south of the Yangtze River, and its commerce has always been prosperous. Since the opening of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway caused changes in the terrain, it has gradually declined. In the last ten years, the situation has become even more desolate due to the siltation of the riverbanks and the failure of wheeled vehicles to connect. Passengers and goods are transferred through Huojiaqiao, and merchants and travelers move with the passengers and goods, resulting in an even more depressed situation for various industries. Last year's flood in Jiangbei caused the only remaining wholesale trade in Jiangbei to be interrupted. Although efforts have been made to recover outstanding debts, it is difficult to collect them in full. Although there are no precise statistics on the direct and indirect losses suffered by the business community due to the flood, it is estimated to be over one million, which has caused a financial panic in the city. Foreign silver has risen to 69 fen, and standard silver has risen to over 960 taels. The silver exchange rate has risen to 60 fen, which is a rare phenomenon. In the past week, although the prices of foreign silver and standard silver have not reached new highs, no one is willing to sell spot silver or standard silver at the market price. The daily quotations of the Money Trade Association are merely for show, and there is actually no transaction. The deposits and debts of money shops have always been based on the Erqi Bao banknotes. The Erqi Bao banknotes can only be used for book entries in the city. If it is necessary to repay debts to other places, it is necessary to exchange them for spot silver or purchase Shenyuan banknotes. It is necessary to negotiate with the corresponding money shops and add a certain amount to the market price. Only small amounts can be handled, but large amounts are difficult to fulfill. In view of this situation, various shops do not dare to deposit money in money shops after receiving payments or selling goods. They prepare to remit accounts to other places through banks, so the financial situation is even more stagnant. The relief measures previously agreed upon by the government and business, such as a bank loan of 500,000 yuan that can be cashed immediately, the Money Trade Association drawing out 1 million yuan in discounted bills, of which half has already been drawn, and the provincial government borrowing and allocating 1 million yuan in construction public bonds that are still pending mortgage of cash, and how to coordinate them, are also pending research and handling. However, there are not many days left until the end of the year, and the financial situation is still as stagnant as before. If relief is delayed further, the market situation will be difficult to be optimistic about in the future.</p>

<p>A Case of Alimony Leading to Serious Injury and Litigation: Fei Shiqing, who moved to Songjiang from the 14th District, had an affair with a certain widow in the past and lived together for a time. They had a daughter, but their feelings gradually faded due to other reasons, and they eventually separated. The woman filed a lawsuit in court, and the court ruled that Fei Shiqing should pay the woman a certain amount of alimony each year for a period of 25 years. Recently, Fei suddenly stopped making payments. The woman went to Fei's residence on the 23rd evening to demand the fulfillment of the judgment, which led to an argument. The woman wanted to move her own furniture, but Fei refused to allow it and pushed the woman out of the door. The woman fell heavily and her occipital bone struck the threshold, causing her skin to break and bleed. She called the police and was sent to the bureau. Because the woman's injuries were not minor, she was first sent to St. Joseph's Hospital for treatment. The doctor said that she had a concussion and there was a risk of danger. After bandaging her wound, she was sent back to the Public Security Bureau. This morning, she was sent to the court's procuratorate for interrogation. The official ordered the defendant, Fei Shiqing, to be detained for investigation. The injured person was sent to Songjiang County Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Bandits Rob in a Bustling Market: The Chen Hengyi Jewelry Store on Nanda Street in the city of Wuyi was visited by a customer wearing short clothes at around 11:00 AM on the 23rd, claiming to want to buy a gold ring. The shop assistant took out five rings for him to choose from. Unexpectedly, he seized the opportunity to grab three rings and flee south. The shop assistants and others followed him and chased him outside, and nearby police officers also joined in the pursuit. When they reached the Shijia Lane, the bandit knew that there were troops stationed ahead, so he threw the gold ring to the ground and fled. However, he was still caught.

<p>Fuxing Rice Store on Dongda Street Robbed: The Fuxing Rice Store on Dongda Street in Jiaxing was visited by three people wearing gray uniforms at 6:00 PM on the afternoon before yesterday, claiming to buy rice. The owner, Wang Shutang, greeted them and asked them which troop they belonged to. They replied that they were from the 7th Company of the 2nd Regiment and needed to buy 15 piculs of white rice. They also took a sample of the rice and left. After the store closed, they were about to go to bed when the three people suddenly came to knock on the door, saying that they urgently needed to buy rice now for breakfast tomorrow. The owner opened the window and the three people showed him the banknotes. The owner was unsuspecting and called the sleeping apprentice, Wang Jusheng (15 years old), to open the door and let the three people in. He then went downstairs to measure the rice. Unexpectedly, after the three people entered the door, they pulled out guns and bayonets and threatened the owner, tying him up with ropes and ordering the apprentice not to move.

<p>Recently, domestic newspapers have been reporting on the mutiny of the 3rd Cavalry Division stationed in Fengxian and the robbery of various agencies and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. We are surprised to hear this. The 3rd Cavalry Division has been stationed in Fengxian for several months now. Their discipline is strict, and the relationship between the military and the people is harmonious. The cause of this incident was purely a temporary problem with the local handling of the division's supplies. A few troublemakers took the opportunity to disrupt and incite the villagers, and after a long time, misunderstandings arose. The losses of various agencies and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank reported by the outside world are not true. However, the guns, ammunition, and horses of the police team of the County Public Security Bureau are still temporarily stored in the division's armory for safety reasons. Both sides have now reached a mutual understanding, the previous grudges have been removed, and all those detained have been released one after another. The guns, ammunition, and horses will be returned immediately. They shook hands and reconciled as before. After this incident, senior officials from various party and government agencies have conducted thorough investigations, and the truth has become clear. All rumors have been dispelled. Various agencies are still operating as usual, and the military and the people are living in peace. In addition to reporting this situation to the central government, the provincial government, and the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office, we are specifically telegraphing to correct the record. Wang Zilan of the Fengxian Education Bureau, Feng Shouxin of the Construction Bureau, Dong Yushu of the Public Security Bureau, Peng Shiheng, the Secretary-General of the Farmers' Association, and Hu Xiaomin, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Explosion of a Small Launch Transporting Explosives at the Arsenal <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Aged Explosives Suspected of Being Ignited by a Spark</p>
<p>The Da Zhong Launch and Tugboat Were Blown to Dust</p>
<p>Only Kuai Xianfa Survived Out of More Than Thirty People</p>
<p>Fishing Boats and Nearby Houses Were Also Affected</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, a violent explosion suddenly occurred on the Jiang surface west of Rihui Port outside the South City, and outside the Beipiao Wharf. The loud noise, black smoke billowed into the sky. Windows and houses dozens of miles away were shaken. The whole city was in a state of panic for a time, and rumors abounded. After investigation, it was learned that an arsenal barge transporting explosives had exploded carelessly in the Huangpu River. More than thirty people died, and only one person was rescued, who was also seriously injured. The small launch transporting explosives and two barges were all sunk. The total loss is immeasurable. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Transporting Explosives The Shanghai Arsenal needs explosive materials. The arsenal launches "Da Zhong" and "Song Yun" are used to transport them to the gunpowder depot in Laoshu Sha, Pudong. As a rule, they are loaded once a week and dispatched by arsenal launches. Yesterday was the same. The General Affairs Section of the Arsenal ordered the small Da Zhong launch to hire four civilian barges the night before, load more than one hundred boxes of shells and gunpowder (which the arsenal workers habitually call "black powder"), and transport them from Pudong to Shanghai for use in two batches.</p>
<p>Explosion in the Huangpu River Yesterday afternoon, the small Da Zhong launch towed barges to Pudong to load the black explosives. First, two barges loaded 55 boxes of explosives, which were towed by the small Da Zhong launch to the West Battery Wharf and unloaded at around 1:00 PM. The unloading was completed at around 2:00 PM, and the launch returned to the Pudong Wharf at 3:00 PM. At this time, the remaining two barges had loaded 45 boxes of explosives, and the launch towed them out again at 3:20 PM. At 3:30 PM, when it arrived at the Jiang surface outside the Beipiao Wharf in Rihui Port, there was a sudden explosion, and thick smoke billowed into the sky. The ammunition on the tugboat was completely destroyed by the explosion, and the two barges were blown to pieces. The Da Zhong launch also sank instantly. However, according to the message from the Garrison Headquarters, the department's investigation report stated that the small Da Zhong launch towed two barges, carrying a total of more than one hundred boxes of explosives, and so on.</p>
<p>Navy Rescue After the launch was bombed, the Navy Guard Battalion Water Patrol Team had not yet learned the truth, so it suspected that an accident had occurred. It immediately dispatched Wanhe, Jiangkang, and Ansan small launches, led by Deputy Team Leader Wang, along with more than a dozen guards, to the scene. The time was 3:35 PM. However, at that time, the Da Zhong launch and the two barges it was towing had been completely destroyed by the explosion. All the personnel on the Da Zhong launch and barges had been tragically killed. The Water Patrol Team only rescued Kuai Xianfa, the second mate of Da Zhong, from the Huangpu River. At around 5:00 PM, the Wanhe launch also recovered a corpse, which was Wang Zhuangda, the stoker of Da Zhong. Last night, the dead were placed at the Navy Wharf, and the arsenal notified their families. Meanwhile, the Wanhe launch was still salvaging.</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident According to the research of the arsenal staff who witnessed this bizarre incident, yesterday's wind was a northwest wind, and it was quite strong. When the Da Zhong launch was towing into the Huangpu River, the smoke from the launch's chimney was blown towards the barges behind due to the wind. The smoke contained sparks. These explosives had been stored for too long and were prone to explosion. Coupled with the warm weather in recent days, various unfortunate reasons combined, the explosives exploded. According to the Datong News Agency, the reason for the explosion of the shells and gunpowder in the boat this time, according to the most reliable observation, was that the "black powder" was stored during the Qing Xuantong period. It had been a long time, and its properties were very dry. At that time, the medicine boxes were not very carefully made, and they were only made of local wood. The wood was dry and shrunk, resulting in box seams. Although the arsenal used paper to paste the box seams, it was not satisfactory. After being loaded into the barges, the cables were attached to the back of the Da Zhong launch and towed. The Da Zhong launch was small, causing smoke and fire to emerge from the chimney and drift into the seams of the medicine boxes, resulting in a sudden outbreak that could not be contained.</p>
<p>Accident to Fishing Boats When the explosives exploded, the sound was like a giant cannon, and black smoke filled the sky. The river water in Huangpu was boiling. Two nearby fishing boats were thrown more than ten feet high due to the force of the explosion. They immediately capsized, and the men, women, old and young in the boats were buried in the Huangpu River. There was also a sailboat that was ignited by sparks from the explosives and immediately burned. Fortunately, it was rescued immediately, only destroying a sail. The stern of the Da Zhong launch was bombarded violently, and its iron anchor flew up several feet, hitting the glass windows on the third floor of the Yitaixing Coal Yard inside the Beipiao Wharf, causing great damage. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<p>Walls Damaged and Windows Broken During the explosion, the sound was heard for dozens of miles. Residents in the South City and the French Concession felt a very strong earthquake. Many houses near Gaochang Temple collapsed. A section of the wall of Nanyang Middle School on Longhua Road collapsed. At that time, the students did not know the truth and returned home. The glass windows of shops in the Nanshi area, such as the Fuan Company in Xiaodongmen, were shattered.</p>
<p>Number of Casualties Due to the short time yesterday, there are no accurate statistics on the number of casualties. According to the arsenal, the number of victims is at least about 30. The small Da Zhong launch had a total of seven employees: Captain Qian Runjin, Chief Mate Gu Yuesheng, Second Mate Kuai Xianfa, Sailor Yuan Yicai, Wei Asi, Wang Zhuangda, and Wang Jinkun. Yuan Yicai was on sick leave and was not killed. Only Kuai Xianfa was rescued. None of the ten or so boatmen on the other two barges survived. The death toll of the two fishing boats that sank together was also more than ten. In total, there were about 30 people. Kuai Xianfa, the second mate who was rescued in critical condition, suffered serious head injuries from the explosion. Peng, the section chief of the arsenal's General Affairs Section, sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by car. It is said that his injuries are serious, and his life may be in danger.</p>
<p>Severe Alert When the disaster occurred, the military, naval, and police agencies in this port were alerted and declared martial law. They sent personnel to investigate in all directions. The Naval Guard Battalion in Gaochang Temple, because the area was most important, declared martial law and placed sentries around the wharf to prevent any accidents. After the report confirmed that the explosives had exploded, fearing that troublemakers would take the opportunity to cause trouble, the alert was not reduced. The army stationed near Gaochang Temple prohibited pedestrians from passing through.</p>
<p>Aftermath Arrangements Yesterday was a Sunday, and most of the arsenal staff were not at the arsenal. According to Peng, the section chief of the arsenal's General Affairs Section, the aftermath of this incident cannot be determined for the time being because the director is in Beijing. However, the arsenal will still handle the compensation for the workers who died on duty in accordance with the usual practice. Currently, they are trying to salvage the bodies. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters reported to the Ministry of Military Affairs last night after receiving confirmation.</p>

Each ship has about 30 officers and soldiers. This time, a large amount of military equipment was transported to Shanghai for the use of the Japanese Marine Corps in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Military Equipment Unloaded Ashore This time, the Japanese fleet opened Shanghai. The Japanese Ministry of the Navy specially transported a large number of military goods, wartime supplies, and equipment, as well as guns, ammunition, and other items.

<p>Banking Industry Advance Payments Although there was no discussion on the issue of bank advance payments yesterday, it is learned that the banking industry believes that it does not have the capacity to provide the huge amount of 16 million yuan for two-month advance payments, with the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank each responsible for 4 million yuan, the Shanghai Commercial Bank responsible for 2 million yuan, and the Exchange and the Money Shop Association each responsible for 1 million yuan. According to Financial Vice Minister Lin Kanghou, the banking industry is not sure that it can raise 7.5 million to 8 million yuan. The Exchange was originally asked to be responsible for 1 million yuan, but the reply has been received, and it can only take 500,000 yuan. The number that other financial institutions are asked to share has not yet been answered, so it is difficult to predict how much the Shanghai banking industry can raise at this time. If it is said that 5 million yuan can be raised, then it can be said with certainty. As for the fact that the Haiguan Mei, the Chief of Customs, can raise about 3 million yuan, I (Lin himself) do not know the details, he said.</p>

<p>Documents issued The Citizens' Federation cabled the National Government Yuan and the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting that the unreasonable demands of the violent Japanese be rejected. At the same time, it issued a solemn declaration to inform the whole country. The record is as follows: (Cable to the National Government Yuan) To the Nanjing National Government Nanjing Executive Yuan Shanghai Municipal Government, The violent Japanese took the opportunity to make demands to the Shanghai Municipal Government, limiting the Shanghai Municipal Government to ban anti-Japanese movements by groups or individuals, and dissolve the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and similar groups, otherwise, they will take necessary military actions. At the same time, gunboats are gathering, and the citizens of Shanghai are extremely indignant. Thinking about the invasion of the northeast by the violent Japanese, the border defense officials abandoned their posts and did not resist with force. It has made the people of the whole country feel heartbroken. Countries around the world consider it an extremely disgraceful country. The violent Japanese have been even more unscrupulous, causing chaos in Tianjin, then disturbing Qingdao, and forcing Fuzhou. Now, they are going to use destructive means against Shanghai, the economic center and the trade hub of our country and various countries. Their eyes are set on China, with no eyes for other countries. It is already obvious that it should be clear that resisting Japan and saving the country should be done with force. However, loving peace is the nature of our people, so using civilian power is a matter of course for those who stand between heaven and earth, even Article 16 of the International League Covenant is clearly stipulated, the violent Japanese do not repent of their evil deeds, do not investigate the reasons for the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement, and do not seek a legitimate solution to the Korean massacre, the army that invaded the three northeastern provinces did not withdraw immediately according to the covenant, and asked the Shanghai Municipal Government to ban it. Alas, if such a demand is approved, the violent Japanese will definitely make further demands, saying, all kinds of education and various books and newspapers have anti-Japanese propaganda and are also anti-Japanese movements, and should be banned and destroyed, saying that various public and private institutions have members who are engaged in anti-Japanese movements, they should be disbanded or dismissed, saying that so-and-so are anti-Japanese activists, they should be severely punished, otherwise, in order to maintain imperial interests, they will have to take necessary military actions, If our country is afraid of its gunboat policy and will admit it one by one, it will forget that it is an independent country, it is specially requested that your government and the court, for this kind of unreasonable request of the violent Japanese that is enough to destroy our Republic of China, quickly instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to give a severe refutation and decide to deal with it with force, the people of Shanghai are willing to be the backing, and cannot win the extreme of waiting for orders (Declaration) The City Federation issued a solemn declaration against the violent Japanese demand to ban the anti-Japanese movement, begging newspapers across the country to forward it to compatriots across the country, The violent Japanese invaded our country's three northeastern provinces and despised world justice, which is already extremely indignant. It is wrong that the border defense officials did not resist with force, and the central government did not deal with it strongly, and it is laboring our people to use civilian power to automatically implement economic severance under Article 16 of the International Covenant. For the violent Japanese, it can be said that they have been benevolent and exhausted. However, it is not enough for the violent Japanese to invade the three northeastern provinces and disturb Tianjin, Qingdao, and Fuzhou. They have once again used disturbances against Shanghai, our economic center and the hub of Chinese and foreign trade. Gunboats have gathered to intimidate the municipal government, demanding the banning of the anti-Japanese movement and the dissolution of the anti-Japanese and national salvation groups. This can be admitted, and what else cannot be asked for, The violent Japanese plan is to make it impossible for our people to use both military and civilian power and to be their slaves and cattle. Once the municipal government approves this unreasonable demand, they can point out that our country's meetings, associations, speech, and publications are all anti-Japanese movements, and the staff of public and private institutions and individuals from all walks of life can be pointed out as members of anti-Japanese movements, and they can be dealt with as they please, and dismissed as they please. Compatriots, the phenomenon of national subjugation is like this, Our Shanghai citizens have already recognized that the border defense officials' non-resistance is a disgrace to their duties, the current government authorities have already stated clearly in the resolutions of the peace conference that non-resistance is not a good plan, and now our Shanghai citizens have already borne the brunt, Anyone with blood will naturally not want to laugh at a hundred steps with fifty steps, and the current government authorities are all pillars of the country, and they should not be willing to do things that laugh at a hundred steps with fifty steps, the indomitable spirit, our Shanghai citizens will never lose the slightest, for the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement, we will definitely go directly again, My beloved compatriots across the country, I hope you will work harder, be more unanimous against the enemy, be the master, or be the slave, all in this last five minutes of effort, go forward bravely, look at death as if returning home, and do not hesitate to express your feelings, I hope you will see clearly, Shanghai Citizens' Federation, saluting, respect,</p>
<h3 id="e84">Representatives of the Anti-Japanese Associations of the Five Southeastern Provinces Return to Shanghai <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Please Decide on a Major Policy Direction as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Representatives Ni Yibao, Zhou Zishi, Jin Luwang, Hou Nianyan, and Niu Busong of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations of the Five Southeastern Provinces previously went to Beijing to petition the Central Party Headquarters and the Special Committee of the Political Conference, requesting that a major policy direction be set immediately and diplomatic relations with Japan be severed immediately. However, no one in the committee was responsible. As a result, Hu Han of the Secretariat accepted it and promised to pass it on. After giving a satisfactory reply, in addition to paying a visit to the special commissioners in Beijing to earnestly state the reasons, they waited for three days, but there was still no solution. Representatives Ni Jin and Niu had already returned to Shanghai yesterday. The petition is recorded below. For the petition to set a major policy direction as soon as possible and sever diplomatic relations with Japan to maintain the critical situation and comfort the people's hope, The Japanese bandits are going deep, and the pass is not guaranteed. The public's anxiety has reached its extreme. Unscrupulous people from all sides are trying to take advantage of the opportunity to make trouble. In the past week, the situation has been obvious. It is inevitable that Japanese ronin will collude everywhere, and the disaster is lurking and will break out at any moment. Although Hu Wangjiang's entry into Beijing is near, the overall situation is not stable. In this special situation, there must be extraordinary measures. The meeting has been established for several days, and the sea is full of people. It should immediately observe public opinion, exercise special powers, and announce the direction at home and abroad. Saving the country is like saving a fire. The fire has already burned greatly. If there is water, it will be poured. The later the water is poured, the more fierce the fire will become. I had been waiting for your consideration, and I did not bother to say it. The Association has been established for three months, running around and calling for help. It is difficult to sleep and eat. It has repeatedly published its views and submitted petitions on file. Now, in view of the approaching of national subjugation and the devastating flood, I have specially sent eight delegates to present them. I beg your association to accept them, clearly show the major policy direction, and announce the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan to maintain the critical situation and comfort the people's hope. If it is delayed again, the people's hearts will disintegrate, and the people of the whole country will inevitably take the initiative to organize movements for the sake of saving the country and self-defense, so as to seek one in ten thousand. The future of national affairs will be unimaginable. I hope that you will accept the foolishness and report the organization of the Association separately for the record. This is also stated, Presented to the Special Committee of the Central Political Conference,</p>

<p>The Shanghai Women's Rights Movement League sent a letter to the National Salvation Groups, saying, since the party's dictatorship has been abandoned by the people, internal strife has continued, and foreign troubles have multiplied, the country will not be a country in April, Now the government is convening a national crisis conference, which seems to have a remorseful heart, but the oppression of the violent Japanese has been added frequently, and there is no way to survive. The League of Nations cannot be relied on, and there must be a correct way for self-salvation. Whether it is economic severance or military preparedness, saving the country should be engraved in the mind to resist the enemy, not just in words. Yi said that if a secret is not kept, disaster will happen, let alone if there is no preparation at all and it gives people a handle. The Book of Songs says, brothers quarrel at home, but defend against external insults, Although the government is not virtuous, it still belongs to compatriots, Our alliance believes that all our national salvation groups should plan for the long-term and the big picture, and automatically not use the words anti-some country, on the one hand, urge the government to abolish the one-party dictatorship, and eliminate the internal class struggle, so that all can hate the enemy and work together for the sake of the country, the personality is there, and there is no thought of dying later, I offer my thoughts, and I hope you will consider them,</p>
<h3 id="e86">Liu Jian Gong's Telegram to the Peiping National Salvation Association <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from Liu Jian Gong, representative of the Northeast Volunteer Army, reads as follows (titles abbreviated): To the Peiping National Salvation Association:</p>
<p>Greetings. Recently, I sent a telegram to the Peiping National Salvation Association, which stated: "To the Peiping National Salvation Association: As a soldier, Jian finds himself at a time when the nation is in peril and the Japanese invaders continue their occupation. Unable to bear the country's demise and the extinction of our race, I have specially united local militias to organize a volunteer army, knowing only to kill the enemy and save the country, and nothing else, merely fulfilling the duty of a citizen. Therefore, the volunteer armies of the people of Jinzhou East and Jilin have been organized and are directly engaged in fierce battles with the enemy almost every day. In the freezing weather, blood and iron fly everywhere. When ammunition runs out and reinforcements are exhausted, we continue with hand-to-hand combat. Any citizen of the Republic of China should understand and sympathize. If not, then at the very least, it should not be considered wrong. Your esteemed association has its own aims, and the volunteer armies under its jurisdiction have their own systems. However, they remain stationed within the Pass, not stepping beyond the boundaries, adhering to a policy of non-resistance, taking a hands-off approach, and even sending telegrams across the country claiming that Jian and others are not representatives of the volunteer army. Indeed, Jian and others are representatives of the Northeast People's Volunteer Army, not representatives of the volunteer army under your esteemed command. As for Zhao Jun Pengfei, he is indeed a man of courage. Having returned from Japan this time, he should take killing the enemy and saving the country as his duty. Since he has not received any favors from any party, he will not support any policy of non-resistance. Due to differing stances, it is difficult to gain the understanding of your esteemed association, and being criticized is unavoidable. It is both lamentable and laughable. Since your esteemed association calls itself a National Salvation Association, anyone who takes on the responsibility of saving the country should be treated equally, without regional boundaries, factional distinctions, or the need to engage in partisan strife. This is what we earnestly hope from your esteemed association. In short, Jian's efforts to resist Japan this time have been repeatedly suppressed. Enduring the pain in silence, I only seek to recover lost territory, restore our mountains and rivers, and seek the free survival of the nation and its people in the world, without suffering the pain of national subjugation and racial extinction. Even if I die unjustly in the afterlife, I would be content. Who is right and who is wrong, let the people of the country judge fairly. We dare not argue further." Liu Jian Gong bows in anticipation of your meeting, hoping for your clear understanding. Liu Jian Gong bows.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Establishment of the National Postal Workers' Federation <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Declaration Issued</p>
<p>The declaration of the National Postal Workers' Federation states: The National Postal Workers' Federation, which we have always remembered, has been fighting for three years through the efforts of postal workers across the country in a difficult and arduous environment, and today it can finally meet the people of the country. We are unconsciously happy and singing and dancing. We recall the struggles and experiences of the past three years, and we pursue the future of our efforts. We cannot help but feel how lovable and precious the organization born out of this difficulty and hardship is, but at the same time, we cannot help but feel how this nascent organization will work hard to break through the layers of thorns in this harsh environment. At a time when external troubles and internal strife are intertwined, especially since the "September 18th" Incident, the people of the whole country have been immersed in a feeling of sorrow and grief, wanting to use the strength of the entire nation to solve all the current difficulties. We believe that the first thing the people should do now is to automatically organize themselves, connect the various scattered forces, and transform them into an organized and united force to fight against all evil forces and imperialists. Only in this way can we relieve our suffering, and only in this way is there a way out for the entire country and the entire nation. All of us postal workers deeply feel this point, so we have gathered postal worker organizations from various places into a general federation. On the one hand, we feel that our strength has increased, and at the same time, we also acknowledge that the responsibility we bear for the country and society has increased. Here, we must put forward the mission of this federation to announce to the country, the people, and the masses that groups and politics are fundamentally inseparable. We not only passively recognize this point, but also actively assist the government to enrich this understanding. Why is Chinese politics not yet on the right track? Why have the excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies of the warlord governments over the years not aroused the resentment of the people? Why are there still intermittent civil wars in the country? Finally, why do the various imperialists openly and covertly plunder and turn China into a semi-colonial country? Why do the Chinese people have no way to abolish the unequal treaties? We dare to boldly say that everything that is contrary to the interests of the people exists because the people are not organized, have no power, and cannot assist the government. To implement the unity of the people and jointly face the national crisis, this is the reason for the establishment of this federation. 1. The postal service is one of the transportation industries, bearing the great mission of promoting culture and developing the national economy, and it is fundamentally not a profit-making organization. In recent years, due to the further corruption of internal affairs, speculators have occupied important positions in the postal service, and instead of doing what should be done from the perspective of the postal service's mission, they only know how to facilitate private interests, and they do not hesitate to break the postal service examination system in order to place relatives and old acquaintances, and turn the postal service into a commercial behavior, competing for profits with ordinary merchants. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, established the year before last, is a very clear example. We postal workers now further understand that only through our own efforts can we achieve the true mission of the postal service. We advocate that the postal economy should be absolutely open and independent, and that the postal economy should prioritize the development of postal services and the expansion of postal lines. However, the scattered forces of postal workers cannot correct the erroneous policies of the authorities. Only when postal workers unite and make organized efforts can they break the current harsh environment and truly bear the fundamental mission of the postal service. To urge the postal authorities to maintain the independence of the postal economy and strive to develop postal services, this is the reason for the establishment of this federation. 2. At this representative meeting of the federation, although there were representatives from as many as sixteen provinces and regions, there were still many remote areas that were unable to send representatives due to the fact that the entire organization had not yet been established or due to environmental reasons. This is the most regrettable thing that the federation felt at this meeting. We know that the reason why remote provinces and regions that have not yet been organized or have already been organized but are not sound is not due to a lack of revolutionary spirit among the workers, but because of the small number of people and insufficient organizational strength. The comrades in remote areas must need the entire organization more urgently than the areas that have already been organized. Now that the federation organization has been established, we believe that under the leadership of this federation, all areas that have not yet been organized or have only unsound organizations will be able to organize and improve themselves, so that the overall organization will be more powerful, and at the same time, the scattered organizations will also be guaranteed. To promote local association affairs and realize the unity of postal workers across the country, this is the reason for the establishment of this federation. 3. In the riddled Chinese society, there is naturally no social organization that can be said to be perfect. Only the postal service can be considered a leader in state-owned public utilities. In fact, to recognize that the reason why the postal service has achieved this better result is entirely due to the public service, law-abiding, hard-working, and diligent work of our postal personnel. However, now the postal authorities are exploiting the vested interests of postal workers on the one hand, and on the other hand, they are actually using the surplus earned through the efforts of our postal workers to flatter others, resulting in the postal economy being on the verge of bankruptcy due to continuous destruction. Now the postal bureau has ordered all postal districts to implement austerity policies due to economic difficulties. Under this current situation, the treatment of postal workers is of course even more out of the question to improve. It must be known that all expenditures in postal construction are purely necessary to promote postal services. The current austerity policy is tantamount to a suicide policy. If the postal authorities continue to want to use the funds for postal construction and the funds for improving the treatment of workers to enrich themselves, we will inevitably oppose them strongly. But without the overall organizational strength, how can we restrain the ambitions of the authorities? To safeguard the postal service in order to improve the treatment of workers, this is the reason for the establishment of this federation. 4. Finally, we must say a few more words. Although the postal workers under the leadership of this federation are sufficient to represent all of the postal workers in the country, there are other parts of the postal workers who are under the leadership of friendly associations. We hope that in the near future, after the overall organization of the friendly association is established, it will be able to join hands with us and fight together. We believe that under joint efforts, the above four goals will inevitably be more thoroughly implemented and more guaranteed. This is the greatest wish of this federation in celebrating its establishment. Furthermore, the postal bureau is a state-owned public utility, and the only purpose of people serving in the postal service is to serve the society and strive to facilitate communication and transportation for the people. Therefore, it can be said that the postal service is not only the postal service of the country, but is actually the postal service of the entire society. Therefore, the prosperity and decline of the postal service is closely related to the interests of the people of the country. At the beginning of the establishment of this federation, we are willing to permanently uphold the above mission, work hard for the people, and hope that compatriots across the country will give us sympathetic assistance. This is the declaration. The National Postal Workers' Federation of the Republic of China, January 24, 21st year of the Republic.</p>

<p>Proposal from the Southern Fujian Association</p>
<p>The Southern Fujian Association in Shanghai telegraphed Fujian organizations and Fujian compatriots at home and abroad yesterday, stating: "According to the proposal of Lin Youren, a standing committee member of this association, our Fujian is known as a land of scholars, producing loyal martyrs for generations. From Huang Daozhou, Zheng Chenggong, Lin Zexu, etc. in ancient times, to Fang Shengdong, Lin Juemin, Lin Shishuang, Chen Yu, Liu Jianyu, etc. in modern times, all fought to the death with foreign races, regardless of their own safety. Only the traitor Zheng Xiaoxu and his son Zheng Chui seduced Puyi and surrendered to the violent Japanese, hoping to rekindle the ashes of the restoration, fulfilling their treacherous plot to sell the country. They are truly the scum of our Fujian and should be announced to be expelled from the province. Please telegraph to Fujian organizations at home and abroad to unanimously advocate, etc." The proposal was passed unanimously. "We are urgently requesting that your association remember the disaster of Qin Hui to Song, Wu Sangui to Ming, and Li Wanyong to Korea, all of whom colluded with foreign enemies as internal traitors. These rebels are obsessed with personal gain and shamelessly serve the enemy. Our 30 million compatriots in Fujian Province, in order to maintain their own personality and the reputation of the entire province, cannot remain silent. We hope that you will unanimously condemn them, expel the rebels and their sons from the province, and avenge the public shame of our 64 counties. Fujian is fortunate, the whole country is fortunate." The Southern Fujian Association in Shanghai bows in respect.</p>

<p>Summoning Representatives from Various Labor Unions</p>
<p>Discussing Methods to Prevent Japanese Violence</p>
<p>During the national crisis, the Shanghai General Labor Union has been actively uniting the strength of various labor unions in the city and preventing traitors from taking the opportunity to cause disturbances, hoping to fulfill the practical task of actively facing the national crisis together. It has been quite effective for several months. Recently, in view of the increasing pressure from the violent Japanese and the large number and important position of workers in the city, for the sake of social security and national self-defense, it is said that it has been decided to summon representatives of various labor unions in the city at 2:00 PM on Tuesday (the 26th) at the association's location at No. 9 Runde Lane, Fusheng Road, to discuss the necessary methods to cope with the violent Japanese and maintain public order, so as to jointly plan for action and achieve the actual effect of resisting aggression.

The remaining committee members will go to Nanjing at a later date to meet with them separately.

<p>Today, a petition will be submitted to the Jianghai Customs and the Supervisory Office.</p>
<p>More than 200 customs brokerage firms in this city are vehemently opposed to the Customs' promulgation of management regulations, which require strict registration by the fourth of this month, due to the urgency of the timeframe. In addition to dispatching representatives to Beijing to petition, they will also unite with customs brokers nationwide to strive for their cause. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Association of Customs Brokers convened an executive committee meeting at its clubhouse at 38 Edward Road to discuss how to respond to the Customs' deadline for registration and implementation of the management regulations. Three points were resolved: (1) Appoint Shi Zhikun, Xu Youren, Zheng Renye, and others as petition representatives, who will first petition the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office in succession this morning. (2) If no results are achieved, the original representatives will proceed to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance. (3) Unite with customs brokers nationwide to resolutely oppose these three points. In addition to telegrams from customs brokers in various regions expressing their unanimous support, Xu Qingyun, a representative specially dispatched by the Hankou customs brokers, came to Shanghai to liaise closely and attended the meeting. The contents of the telegrams from various regions are recorded as follows: (1) Telegram from Changsha (excerpt): "The Ministry of Finance has issued new regulations for suppression, and our association has resolved to protest and has submitted them to party and government organs, requesting the Ministry to retract the order. This matter concerns the survival of our industry, and we request that your association take charge of everything to facilitate progress. Our association will provide support. We also request that you appoint representatives to go to Beijing to petition. Even if the goal of retracting the order cannot be achieved, the security deposit item must be absolutely denied. What is your association's opinion? How should we proceed with this matter? We eagerly await your instructions." The Changsha Municipal Association of Customs Brokers and Transportation Industry bows respectfully. (2) Telegram from Jiujiang (excerpt): "The telegram from Gengri has been received. We have not yet inquired about the progress of your association's resolution regarding the Customs' promulgation of the interim regulations for the management of customs brokerage firms and the current situation. Also, we read in the newspaper that the Customs has newly issued a four-part form for payment, which is very cumbersome. We now hear that after serious negotiations by your association, it has been changed to a white three-part form. What is the format of the white three-part form? Does the white three-part form still need to be affixed with a stamp, and how should it be affixed? We hope you will provide a reply for our reference. We believe that your association is located in the commercial center of the country and is a leader for customs brokers in various ports. We will follow your lead in everything and hope that you will not hesitate to teach and guide us, so that we may have something to follow. We would be deeply grateful." The Jiujiang Association of Customs Brokers bows respectfully. (3) Telegram from Shantou (excerpt): "We have read the ChaoHai Customs' announcement regarding the management and tax reporting regulations, which contain many obstacles. Our local industry intends to request the withdrawal of the order. We do not know what measures you are taking and what progress you are making. Please reply by telegram immediately for our reference." The Shantou Transportation and Docking Department bows respectfully.</p>

<p>Ni Yang Zhenhua, a woman from Huaining County, Anhui Province, is currently 24 years old. Her father, Yang Shouzhi, worked in the Railway Bureau in Wuhu before his death at the age of 54. Her mother died early. She then married Ni Kaiyu, son of Ni Jiacai, a native of Anhui who ran the Yiwen Pavilion paper shop in Wanyuan. After the marriage, her father-in-law also died, and the shop was managed by her husband. On September 11, 1927, her husband left home in a fit of anger due to family matters, and the shop was closed. Her aunt also died of illness, and there were no uncles or brothers on either her mother's or father's side. She only has a five-year-old daughter. Destitute and helpless, with no means of support, she came to Shanghai last October to look for her husband but found no trace of him. She got lost on the way and was sent by the police to the China Relief Association for Women and Children, where she has been staying for over a year. The association noted that Yang was anxious to return home, but Anqing was far away, and she was a woman, so they sent a letter to the Anhui Association of Compatriots in Shanghai requesting that she be sent back to her hometown, which would be more appropriate. The association sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the situation. The Relief Association for Women and Children sent Yang and her daughter to the association. The association inquired about her background and address in detail. Because she was eager to return to her hometown but had no reliable companion, a member of the association, feeling sorry for her plight, temporarily housed her in his home, employed her for housework, and waited for her relatives to claim her.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Second Major Fire at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Warehouse Number Seven Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>The Losses from the Fire Exceed Millions</p>
<p>The Qichang Warehouse, managed by the British firm Jardine Matheson, is located on the opposite bank of the Huangpu River from the Wayside Wharf in Yangshupu, divided into east and west warehouses, both occupying a very wide area. On December 25 of last year, the west warehouse was carelessly set on fire, burning more than 5,000 bales of cotton. The H warehouse, built with steel frames and iron plates, was also completely destroyed, making it a rare major fire in Shanghai last year. Unexpectedly, one month later, while the embers of the west warehouse had not yet been extinguished, the east warehouse caught fire last night, starting around 7:30 PM and burning late into the night without being completely extinguished. The losses are no less than those of the west warehouse. The goods burned were also mostly cotton. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Night Work Stacking Goods: The "Japanese Prince" arrived at the Qichang East Warehouse yesterday morning and docked to unload cargo. Yesterday was Sunday, which is usually a day of rest, but because the cargo on the ship needed to be unloaded quickly, the ship worked both during the day and at night, unloading the cargo from the ship and stacking it in warehouse number seven. The cargo included items such as beeswax and cigarette paper. The cargo had not yet been completely unloaded when the fire started.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire: Around 7:30 PM yesterday, night work had already begun, and the workers were busy stacking and unloading goods when they suddenly heard an explosion and a strange noise in warehouse number seven. Smoke quickly filled the air, and flames spread in all directions. The workers immediately retreated from the warehouse, but the disaster had already begun. Thick smoke billowed, making it difficult to breathe. In a short time, the fire broke out and spread until the entire warehouse number seven was engulfed in flames and could not be extinguished.</p>
<p>Entire Warehouse Burned: After the fire started, the warehouse's own fire-fighting boat immediately drew water from the Huangpu River to put out the fire. After a while, the alarm sounded, and the Customs' fire-fighting boat, the Muddy Water Ferry fire truck, and the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade boat all arrived at the scene to put out the fire. However, in addition to the newly arrived beeswax and tobacco leaves, the warehouse also contained more than 1,100 bales of cotton. After the fire started, the beeswax melted and ignited everything it touched, and the cotton fueled the blaze, making it even more intense. Although the firefighters tried their best to put out the fire, it was initially ineffective. It was not until two hours later that the fire gradually came under control, but the roof had been completely burned, leaving only the surrounding broken walls.</p>
<p>Extreme Danger: The ill-fated warehouse number seven was located between warehouse numbers six and nine. Warehouse number six contained mostly kerosene, and the two warehouses were very close to each other. Therefore, after warehouse number seven caught fire, warehouse number six was in imminent danger. If it were to be caught by the flames, it would be certain to be destroyed. The explosion of oil would be extremely dangerous. Fortunately, the firefighters tried their best to isolate the flames, so a major disaster was averted.</p>
<p>Embers of the West Warehouse: The fire at the west warehouse on December 25 was about a month before yesterday's fire at the east warehouse. Because the west warehouse contained a large amount of cotton, the embers had not been extinguished for a month, and there was always a risk of rekindling. Therefore, the warehouse constantly assigned people to guard it in preparation for putting out the fire at any time. Unexpectedly, while the embers of the west warehouse had not been extinguished, the east warehouse suddenly caught fire again. Warehouse number seven, which suffered the disaster yesterday, had been built for a long time and was not constructed with steel frames and concrete like the west warehouse. Therefore, the roof was burned very quickly after the fire started, and the flames soared into the sky, visible from the Bund in western Shanghai. The cotton, beeswax, tobacco leaves, wood, sealing wax, and oil stored in the warehouse were mostly insured, and the losses were enormous. The exact amount is unknown, but it is said that the cotton alone was worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. Added to the other goods, the scale of the losses is imaginable.</p>

<p>The current foreign manager of the American Express Bank Co., Ltd. at 15 Jiujiang Road, Austrian A. Porges, lived with his wife in room 912 of the thirteen-story Western-style boarding house at the far west end of Route Petain in the French Concession. Every Saturday and Sunday, Porges would regularly take his wife for a drive in the western suburbs of Shanghai, regardless of the weather. Yesterday, he again accompanied his wife in his own car, number 7895, heading straight for the western suburbs of Shanghai. At 12:15 PM, the car arrived near Zhongshan Road on Hongqiao Road, not far from the airport. The area around the airport has always been a martial law zone, and no one, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, is allowed to pass without a special pass. Porges did not pay attention and drove the car into the restricted area at high speed. The soldiers guarding the area saw the car driving past and rushed forward to stop it. Porges ignored them and continued driving straight ahead. The soldiers immediately fired a warning shot into the air, but the car continued to speed forward. The soldiers were unable to order the car to stop. In a desperate situation, they raised their guns and fired a shot at the car. The bullet entered from the rear of the car, hitting Porges in the back and piercing his chest. The car then stopped slowly. When the soldiers rushed up to check, Porges had already fallen into the car with a hole in his chest. Porges' wife was also dumbfounded. The soldiers immediately rushed to report to the airport and sent personnel to investigate. At that time, Porges had already lost consciousness and was taken to the hospital, but he died on the way. His body has now been transported to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road to await the encoffinment.</p>

<p>Shen Bingqian, President of the Shanghai District Court, has been transferred to the position of President of the Wuhu District Court due to wartime duties. The position of President of the Shanghai Court will now be taken over by Shen Xiqing, a staff member of the Ministry of Justice. The transfer order was forwarded by the High Court yesterday. The court is currently rushing to complete the handover procedures, so the various divisions and accounting and general affairs departments are extremely busy, waiting for the new incumbent to take over. The former President Shen Xiqing is from Shaoxing and has served as the Presiding Judge of the Jiangsu High Court and the President of the Wuxian Local Court. After Mei Yigui fled, he was transferred to the position of President of the Shanghai Local Court. He resigned after the Party army recovered Shanghai in 1927. He then moved to the Presiding Judge of the Zhejiang High Court. The year before last, he was transferred to the position of Chief Clerk of the Shandong High Court. Last year, he was transferred to the position of staff member of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. This time, he is reappointed to his current position.</p>

<p>Wu Liande Hosts Banquet for Chinese and Foreign Shipping Companies</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the Port Quarantine Station, hosted a banquet for managers and captains of Chinese and foreign shipping companies at the East Asia Restaurant on the evening of the 22nd. The banquet was scientific and full of interest, and nearly a hundred guests attended, making it a grand occasion. In his speech, he said, "Recalling December 9 of last year, I had the pleasure of meeting you all at the old Carlton Hotel. Today, I invite you to enjoy Chinese cuisine to change your palate, as Chinese cuisine also has its own merits. I would like to express my infinite wishes to you all, because port quarantine is not a matter for one family or one country. Its purpose is to protect the health of mankind and has a close relationship with international health. Although our office has not been in charge for very long, we have received a great deal of assistance from you all. Now, I am adopting the only new method of port quarantine in the world, which will not cause any inconvenience to either the passengers or the shipping companies, but will not be perfunctory. The current port quarantine system is based on the principles of the 1926 International Health Conference and is based on the implementation of quarantine work by the health authorities of various countries, and also takes into account the operations of shipping companies. Therefore, our office is also very willing to work hand in hand with you to promote the development of the health of mankind. I also hope that you will not misunderstand if you are sometimes fined for violating regulations. You must know that we have a fundamental cooperative significance for humanitarian health. I believe that you all understand this deeply. Over the years, we have received a great deal of assistance from various companies, as well as the Inspector General of Customs, the Customs Commissioner, the Shipping Department, and the Water Patrol. I would like to express my sincere gratitude. Now, I will briefly report the number of ships and crew members inspected by the medical officers of our office from October 1920 to December 1921. A total of 2,234 ships were inspected, with a tonnage of 15,142,733 tons. In Wusongkou, 697 ships were inspected, with a tonnage of 2,924,844 tons. In Shanghai, 5,414 Chinese passengers and 88,620 foreign passengers were inspected. In Wusong, 52,748 Chinese passengers and 3,514 foreign passengers were inspected. In Shanghai, 52,690 Chinese sailors, 85,309 European sailors, 72,346 Japanese sailors, and 9,705 Indian sailors were inspected. In Wusong, 39,669 Chinese sailors and 22,150 European sailors were inspected. This number does not include inland river vessels, because these vessels are exempt from quarantine during non-epidemic periods. This further illustrates the commercial development of Shanghai and the Yangtze River. I will now compare the tonnage of ships entering and leaving the Port of London in 1920: 160,085 ocean-going vessels (including cruise ships and fishing boats), totaling 22,582,014 tons, and 11,952 coastal vessels, totaling 6,650,900 tons. In 1921, the number of ships was 795, with a registered tonnage of 2,030,675 tons. 1,077 sailboats were inspected in Wusong, 1,828 in Nanshi, 401 in Yangshupu, 276 in the upper reaches of the Suzhou River, and 1,554 in the lower reaches. In total, 5,236 sailboats were inspected and disinfected this year. This is a record that can be used as a basis. In addition to quarantine and fumigation and disinfection, our office, led by myself and specialized personnel who have just returned from overseas investigations, is studying the rats and rat-related matters in the Shanghai port area. This research work will be gradually promoted to all ports in the country, so that in-depth scientific research can be conducted and benefit mankind. In addition, free treatment is provided at the attached clinics in Wusong and Nanshi for sailors in the port. Last summer, when cholera was prevalent in Shanghai, it was quickly extinguished thanks to the assistance of the health authorities of Shanghai and the concessions. A total of 482 cases of cholera were discovered, with only 57 deaths. The prevention and control work was carried out for 76 days from the start of the epidemic. After that, our office continued to carry out smallpox prevention work. Since winter, nearly one million people have been vaccinated against smallpox. We also paid special attention to ships coming from the Xiamen epidemic area and have gradually seen the extinction of the epidemic. Since January 1921, when our office took over the quarantine affairs of Xiamen Port and established an office, we have greatly renovated it and built a contagious disease hospital, which is deeply gratifying as it meets the needs of the smallpox epidemic in Xiamen. When our office took over, there were only two quarantine boats and one fumigation and disinfection boat. Now, we have expanded to four large boats and two disinfection boats. This is also a small achievement that I have striven to build for the country. I deeply hope that within the shortest possible time, we can develop more than 100 important ports along the coast and inland rivers of the country equally, so that we can keep pace with all advanced countries. In order to ensure the swift reception of world epidemic information, our office has established a secret telegraph code with the Far East Health Bureau stationed in Singapore by the League of Nations and the port quarantine agencies of major countries to exchange information and facilitate quarantine. Today, I have presented the duties and plans of our office to you all, and I deeply hope to exchange knowledge to correct any shortcomings and solemnly express my gratitude for your past assistance and my hope for your guidance in the future. I offer a cup of water and wine to wish the representatives of all major shipping companies good health.</p>
<h3 id="e109">National Medicine Industry Opposes Elevated Cost of Cortex Moutan <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal National Medicine Industry Association convened an urgent meeting the other day to address the inflated market price of Cortex Moutan by pharmaceutical companies. Attendees included executive committee members Li Kangnian, Zhou Qiansheng, Zhou Zhide, Zhang Hongzhao, Sun Wen'an, Zhuang Meitang, Niu Hegao, Feng Jinpu, Guo Baosheng, Zhang Meian, and Guangfu, among others. Zhuang Meitang chaired the meeting. Zhang Hongzhao, who proposed the meeting, reported on the situation where four firms – Yongtai Fu, Heli Yuan, Yicheng, and Licheng – had exclusive sales rights for Cortex Moutan, monopolizing the market. After discussion, it was unanimously decided to firmly oppose the monopolistic behavior of Yongtai Fu and others. Besides instructing all members to slow down the processing of Cortex Moutan raw materials in preparation for returning them to the sellers, a letter of protest was sent to the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, demanding a response within three days. The letter stated that the market price of Cortex Moutan should be based on the Hangzhou market price and not exceed it; otherwise, the goods would be returned to show determination. The letter reads as follows:</p>
<p>To the Pharmaceutical Industry Association,</p>
<p>We are writing to inform you that the four companies, Yongtai Fu, Yicheng, Licheng, and Heli Yuan, in your industry have for years monopolized the sale of Cortex Moutan, arbitrarily raising wholesale prices and using purely capitalistic means to manipulate the market. This oppresses small and medium-sized merchants and indirectly increases the burden on poor and sick families, which greatly affects society and commerce. Our association believes that the purpose of an industry association is to correct the malpractices of its members. Your association, as the leader of the pharmaceutical industry, has remained silent on the monopolistic behavior and market manipulation of Yongtai Fu and others, which is deeply perplexing. This year, the opening price of Cortex Moutan has risen to a staggering 150 taels of silver per dan (unit of weight), more than double the 70-80 taels per dan it sold for three years ago. However, the opening price in Hangzhou is only 200 yuan per dan, with an 80% weight conversion. Given that Shanghai and Hangzhou are neighboring cities with the same goods from the same sources, such a significant difference is hardly fair. Moreover, with Western medicine increasingly encroaching upon the market share of traditional Chinese medicine, the monopolistic behavior only gives the Western medical community more ammunition for criticism. The members of our association have suffered under this oppression for years and refuse to be treated like mere commodities any longer. We convened an urgent meeting today and unanimously decided to firmly oppose the monopolistic behavior of Yongtai Fu and others in manipulating the Cortex Moutan market. We have also resolved that the market price of Cortex Moutan in this city should be based on the Hangzhou market price and not exceed it, aiming to stabilize prices and alleviate the burden on the poor and sick. If Yongtai Fu and others insist on pursuing their monopolistic agenda and disregard public opinion, our members will have no choice but to return the goods to show our determination. We request that your association respond within three days of receiving this letter so that we may take further action.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>The various water and land authorities in Wusong held a special winter defense meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. Attendees included representatives from the 4th Regiment of the garrison, the Naval Command, the Fortress Headquarters, the Coastal Defense Office, the Chamber of Commerce, the Defense Corps, the Public Security Bureau, the Party Headquarters, the Municipal Office, and the 4th District Water Police Anti-Smuggling Brigade. Regiment Commander Zhong chaired the meeting. Discussions focused on strengthening defense measures, paying attention to key roads, and shortening the Songhu (Shanghai-Wusong) train route after 9:00 PM. Several other important matters were also discussed.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Electrical and Silk Weaving Industry Association Petitions for Investigation into Similar Organization <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical and Silk Weaving Industry Association submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that it had discovered an illegal organization forming without authorization, and requested a thorough investigation and prohibition to avoid confusion and misrepresentation. The association stated that since its establishment, it has a long history, and when public organizations were reorganized according to law, it was approved and registered by the Municipal Bureau and the Shanghai Party Headquarters, recognizing it as the legal group for the electrical and silk weaving industry in Shanghai. However, on the 22nd of this month, the association read in the *Shi Bao* newspaper that Lu Zhongying and others had initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Fine Weaving Electrical Silk Fabric Industry Association, and had convened a meeting yesterday at No. 3, Lane 3, Zhenhua Lane, Malong Road, electing Lu Zhongying and eight others as preparatory committee members. Regardless of the truth, and whether the report is entirely fictitious, Article 4 of the Implementing Rules for Industry Associations stipulates that if two or more organizations are initiated in the same industry, the local competent authority shall verify and determine which is legitimate. Furthermore, the association was established earlier and registered according to law, and it is difficult to allow an illegal organization to be established afterward, as it would violate the law and hinder association affairs, which is extremely undesirable. Therefore, in addition to attaching the news report from the *Shi Bao* newspaper, the association is submitting this petition for your office to review and investigate thoroughly, to prohibit the illegal organization, to avoid confusion, and for the public benefit of industry and commerce. It is reported that the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have also submitted similar petitions.</p>

The shareholders then discussed various proposals and unanimously decided to issue dividends starting on February 1st of this year. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Living a Romantic Life in the Dance Hall</p>
<p>Unwilling to Marry the Boatman</p>
<p>The dancer Wu Ailin, originally named Hou Panying, also known as Gendi, was betrothed to Genquan by her parents when she was fifteen years old. Shortly after, her father passed away, and her mother was unable to support her, so she was raised in her husband's family. However, the following year, Genquan's parents also passed away one after another. Genquan, needing to inherit his father's business, went out to work as a boatman, and sent Ailin to live with her aunt. Unexpectedly, in May of last year, she was enticed to come to Shanghai and became a dancer in a dance hall. Due to the influence of the environment, she completely changed her ways. Her mother also regretted the marriage and hired a lawyer to publish a notice in the newspaper stating that her daughter had never been betrothed to anyone. Genquan, upon reading the newspaper, rushed to his aunt's house to inquire, only to find that Ailin had long left. He immediately came to Shanghai and filed a petition with the First Special District Court, requesting mediation. However, Wu Ailin consistently avoided appearing, ultimately leading to the failure of mediation. Now, Wu Genquan has formally filed a lawsuit, requesting that their marriage contract be confirmed as legal. However, Ailin has now transformed into a purely modern young woman, showing no trace of her former village girl appearance. Having seen and heard nothing but extravagance, she is unwilling to marry a boatman. The matter is quite clear. Judge Yang held a hearing the other day and ordered a continued hearing at a later date to investigate the evidence.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Tan Meiying Files for Divorce for the Second Time <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Guangzu's Nature Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Living with a Dancer Again</p>
<p>Zhao Guangzu, residing at No. 60, Jingxin Lane, Huade Road, is a young and romantic man who particularly enjoys frequenting brothels. Several years ago, he was swindled out of the property deed of his house by the courtesan Mei Fei and Hu San, who mortgaged it away. His wife, Tan Meiying, was angered by this and turned against him, first suing Mei Fei for fraud in court, and then filing for divorce from Zhao. After the initial trial ruled against her, Mei Fei, unwilling to accept the verdict, filed an appeal against Tan Meiying. Tan Meiying also appealed the initial ruling against her divorce. Later, with the intervention of friends and relatives from all sides, both cases were settled peacefully. From then on, Mei Fei remained a goddess, and Zhao and Tan reconciled. After such a dramatic turn of events, it was believed that Zhao would stay away from the stages and dance halls and live with Tan until their hair turned white. Unexpectedly, the separation began again after only a year of reconciliation. Tan has now hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to request that the First Special District Court's civil mediation office summon Zhao Guangzu to court for divorce mediation. According to her statement, shortly after their reconciliation, Zhao relapsed into his old habits, abandoning his proper business and neglecting his family. He is now involved with the dancer Wang Aliu from the Dahu Dance Hall, openly cohabiting with her at No. 12, Xiangkang Lane, Baike Road. On the 2nd of this month, the plaintiff personally witnessed the two sleeping together. He spends his time gambling and wandering outside, often not returning home for several days. The debts he owes are constantly being demanded by creditors at the door, leaving her unable to cope. Recently, when she asked him for household expenses, he became enraged and assaulted her, showing no kindness or gratitude. Although he owns assets worth 100,000 yuan, he spends them recklessly, giving her whatever she demands. If all the family property is squandered one day, how will the plaintiff survive? Therefore, she requests mediation to persuade them to divorce and to order Zhao to pay her 20,000 yuan in alimony to support her livelihood. Judge Yang Yi held a hearing on Saturday, but because Zhao did not appear, the mediation could not proceed, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Peppermint Oil Lawsuit Still Unresolved <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jiliang, the general manager of the Shanghai Zhenhua Peppermint Manufacturing Factory, previously sent Li Qianwan, the manager of the factory, to Ji'an, Jiangxi Province, to purchase peppermint oil. Li then entered into an agency contract with Liu Youdao of the local Gongping Store and Wang Rongzhai of the Shengji Store, setting a fixed price. The two stores then shipped 10,000 catties (unit of weight) to Shanghai. However, Zhu suddenly complained that the price was too high and delayed picking up the goods and paying. Liu and Wang had no choice but to hire lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Zhan Yigang to file a lawsuit against Zhu and Li, requesting the court to order the defendants to repay the 122,300 yuan in advance payments. The case was heard again by Judge Li of the First Special District Court the other day. Defendant Zhu Jiliang still claimed that he only instructed Li Qianwan to go to Jiangxi to purchase goods for cash and had no right to enter into a contract. He equivocated in every possible way. Judge Li, understanding the defendant's intention to overturn the contract due to the lack of profit, tried to persuade Zhu to reach a settlement with the plaintiffs. Plaintiff lawyer Zhan Jifeng stated that the plaintiffs deeply understood the court's intention to resolve the matter peacefully and were willing to settle. However, Zhu ultimately did not want to suffer any losses and shifted all the responsibility to Li Qianwan, claiming that the contract was privately entered into by Li and that he would file criminal charges against Li. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that Zhu was intentionally delaying the matter and requested that the court make a swift ruling. Judge Li then ordered the defendant to either settle the case or file a lawsuit against Li within a week; otherwise, the case would continue to be heard.</p>

The robbers were armed with pistols and stole over 400 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars. The Gordon Road police were notified, and Chinese and foreign detectives immediately rushed to the scene. As they arrived at the lane entrance, the robbers were fleeing with the stolen goods. The detectives bravely stepped forward and fired a total of five shots, apprehending two of the robbers on the spot and recovering some of the stolen money. The other three robbers escaped in the meantime and could not be found. The two arrested robbers were taken to the police station for preliminary interrogation and will be sent to the court for further review.</p>

The cause of the fire was unknown. Zhu Benrong was then transferred to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for further interrogation and investigation.</p>

<p>Hong Nian</p>
<p>The current crises facing China are: (1) The lack of "sincere unity" among key party and government figures creates political instability; (2) Japan's occupation of the Northeast stirs up public unrest; (3) Victims of disasters (including disaster areas, war zones, and bandit areas) and refugees (referring to those fleeing the Northeast and those under Japanese rule) have no means of support and will resort to desperate measures; (4) The Red Army and the Communist Party advocate violent revolution to disrupt social order; (5) Thus creating a state of internal and external pressure on today's situation. How can this situation be "rectified" and "saved"? Clearly, it is necessary to quell internal troubles on one hand and resist foreign aggression on the other. But regardless of internal or external matters, the most important thing is to solve the economic problem first. We see that the disaster relief for floods, the relief for refugees in the Northeast, the assistance to Ma Zhanshan, and the support for the Volunteers in recent months have all been based on public donations. This "donation" is the quick fix for both internal and external problems. Examining the contributors to each donation, most are ordinary people with conscience and good intentions, especially ordinary people and poor vendors and paupers. They sympathize with the compatriots in distress and the patriotic soldiers, donating their lifelong savings with hard work and effort. How admirable and touching is this! What about the high-ranking officials? We rarely hear of them donating a single penny. Are they all "incorruptible and impoverished," poorer than even the vendors and paupers? I don't believe it, I don't believe it. After reading the previous newspaper statistics comparing the private wealth of certain officials to several million, I believe it even less. The government is as poor as the Beijing government, and even government agencies and offices are facing "starvation" and closure. At the same time, we also hear that many high-ranking officials deposit their money in foreign banks, remit money to foreign countries to buy land, operate large enterprises in the country, buy land, and build houses and villas. Therefore, I formally suggest that after those in power abandon their prejudices and establish a truly unified government, they should ask the high-ranking officials to generously donate two-thirds or one-half of their private property to save their compatriots, eliminate internal troubles, strengthen national defense, and fight foreign wars. "Distributing wealth will gather people." Distributing wealth is the best way to win over the people. If everyone has food to eat, then what Communist Red Army can stir up trouble again? Give generous rewards to brave men and store provisions for war. Diplomacy backed by military strength is bound to be victorious. This is the effective way to save the "crisis" and "disaster."

<p>The Ministry of Education previously issued a general order to investigate the general situation of secondary education throughout the country.

<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>In the summer of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931], based on the findings of the 17th year's [1928] survey and statistics, a general overview of secondary education throughout the country was compiled, and the "Outline for Secondary Education Facilities" was promulgated. All provinces and cities were instructed to comply with it starting from the 20th year. The main points are: 1. Ordinary secondary schools in all provinces and cities are already more numerous than vocational schools, so high school ordinary courses and junior high schools will not be added for the time being. 2. All provinces should add higher and lower-level agricultural and industrial vocational schools, depending on the circumstances. 3. County secondary schools should stop enrolling ordinary secondary school students and instead enroll vocational or rural normal school students. If it is indeed necessary to establish a secondary school, a vocational course or rural normal school course should still be attached. 4. All secondary schools should uniformly add vocational subjects or attach vocational courses. 5. Vocational schools or vocational courses attached to secondary schools should raise sufficient funds, strengthen equipment, and earnestly cultivate students' labor habits and production skills. 6. If private individuals in counties and cities apply to establish ordinary secondary schools, except in cases where the county or city is too far from the provincial secondary school and it is verified that it is necessary, they may be approved for establishment at their discretion; otherwise, they should be supervised or persuaded to change to agricultural, industrial, or other vocational schools. (6) Improving elementary education, such as promulgating standards for primary schools, kindergartens, and equipment, formulating standards for primary school moral education, and reviewing textbooks for primary school children (more than one hundred have been approved and determined, more than fifty have been returned for revision, and recently a committee has been organized to formulate standards for the compilation of children's books for the elementary education section).

In April of the 20th year, two methods related to promoting compulsory education were promulgated: one is the method for enriching children's enrollment in rural primary schools, and the other is the method for promoting primary education in prosperous cities. Recently, all provinces and cities have been instructed to follow these methods and submit detailed plans for approval and implementation.) Guaranteeing local educational funds (the "Measures for the Custody of Local Educational Funds" were formulated in May of the 20th year and submitted to the Executive Yuan for an order to all provincial and municipal governments to comply). (7) Promoting social education, such as promoting mass education (according to the latest report, there are a total of 20,089 mass schools nationwide, with Hebei having the most, with 6,606 schools, followed by Shanxi, with 5,734 schools. To facilitate literacy, efforts are being made to promote the phonetic alphabet), promoting libraries (there are 1,620 libraries nationwide, including 1 national library, 48 provincial libraries, 1,052 municipal and county and private libraries, 397 libraries attached to schools, 75 libraries attached to institutions and associations, and 41 libraries with specialized characteristics), promoting the national calendar and high-minded entertainment, soliciting national anthems, collecting educational products to be transported to Belgium for exhibition (China's performance ranked third), inspecting films, and organizing a calendar research association.

<h3 id="e133">Jinan Lost to Lux Due to Strategic Error <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Result: 0 to 3</p>
<p>The A-League Championship is Inevitably Shaken</p>
<p>Scott Still Leads</p>
<p>The Jinan team, which had hoped to win the A-League championship for Westerners, lost to Lux yesterday with a score of zero to three due to the absence of general Chen Zhenhe due to a leg injury and the lack of a commander at the front, resulting in no offensive ability. Fortunately, its internal guards were strong and able to maintain the half-wall for 75 minutes. Suddenly changing tactics, Liang Shutang was appointed as the forward, and as soon as a loophole was exposed, three goals were lost in a row. The game ended with a score of zero to three, losing to Lux. The future of the A-League championship is inevitably shaken. Spectators at the China Baseball Field were also disappointed. Referee: Maxwell.</p>
<p>Lux:</p>
<p>Beaker, Archie</p>
<p>Jensen, Cochren</p>
<p>David Turner, Thompson</p>
<p>Logen, Lochha</p>
<p>H. Mada, P. Mada</p>
<p>Jinan Team:</p>
<p>Liang Shutang, Long Liwen</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou, Fu Heyi</p>
<p>Chen Buzhang, Zhuang Shihong, Qiu Dongyan</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing, Chen Zhenxiang</p>
<p>Chen Fuzhong, Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>Old Injury Recurred Shortly After the Start of the Game</p>
<p>Jinan played against the wind, and Qiu Zhongfeng dribbled the ball to attack. The ball went back and forth in the central area with little progress. After five minutes, Qiu's old injury recurred and he left the field to rest. Jinan's morale was shaken, and the enemy invaded and pressed on from all sides, advancing on five fronts. Chen Buzhang, Jiang Shanjing, Feng Yunyou, and Liang Shutang separately blocked them with no chance to take advantage of. After ten minutes, Qiu re-entered the game with his injury, and the situation turned to balance. Qiu's attack was weak, and the Lux goalkeeper caught the ball at will. Liang Shutang supplemented it, and Mei Hongbao shot from the ground but went into the goalkeeper's hands.</p>
<p>Preserving the Goal is Left to Fate</p>
<p>The overall situation was that Jinan's forward attack was weak, and the internal guards were naturally doubly shocked. However, the enemy was seen invading one after another, attacking repeatedly. Occasionally breaking through for a counterattack, there was nothing surprising. Liang Shutang suddenly made up his mind, acting as a lone army, and actually made a long expedition. Although he didn't hit the target, it was a slight consolation to the people. Lux's forward Becker also launched a remote attack, and Jiang Shanjing returned the block slightly obliquely. The ball trended inward, fortunately touching the wooden pillar and remaining unscathed. Escaping from the dead, the forward rose up and first forced a corner kick, followed by Mei Hongbao's pass, and finally saw Qiu Dongyan's header, hitting the goalpost. Qiu then kicked it, and the first half ended with a whistle after crossing the goal, with a score of zero to zero.</p>
<p>Three Goals Lost in a Row Due to Strategic Error</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Jinan had a turning point, assisted by the wind, and felt even more impressive. Mei Hongbao approached the enemy's goal, but did not attack himself, letting Qiu do it. Qiu's injury had not fully healed, so how could he have strength? As a result, a great opportunity was wasted. Lux launched an attack, but it was also ineffective, resulting in a stalemate. Within thirty minutes, Jinan was safe due to its strong internal guards. Suddenly, Lux forward H. Mada fell to the ground with the ball, injured his arm and left the field, thinking it was a gift from heaven, changing their strategy and switching Liang and Fu's positions, in order to emphasize the offensive side. Unexpectedly, due to this change, Archie took the opportunity to pass the ball in front of the goal, Chen Buzhang slapped it out with both hands, and Thompson greeted it with his head, hitting the inside of the goal squarely. As the floodgates opened, the flood poured in. Archie kicked in the second goal, and Lochha scored the third goal.</p>
<p>Heroes Lose Their Temper When Their Nest is Overturned</p>
<p>When the first goal was lost, Jinan switched Feng and Zhuang again, hoping to thicken the forward strength. Who knew that the second and third goals were scored in succession. So they fully focused on the attack, hoping for a turning point. However, the players felt the pain of having their nest overturned, and actually acted barbaric, which was a miscalculation. At that time, the saying that the spirit of the Second Xia was more important than victory or defeat was probably put out of their minds. Jiang Shanjing became emotional, fouled and was sent off, and Jinan lost a line of defense as a result. However, at that time, both sides had no fighting spirit, and the game soon came to a close. Jinan lost to zero to three. From then on, Lincoln West captured an invisible ascent to a higher level in the A-League, while Scott won the Navy with four to zero yesterday, actually ranking first among the teams.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Shanghai Basketball A-League: Yesterday, Zhenru Won Big Against Youth <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>32 to 22 Points</p>
<p>The Situation Was Very Slow, and There Was No Excitement</p>
<p>The Elite Team Will Play Jianhua Tonight</p>
<p>The Youth Basketball Team, a variant of the YMCA, was greatly disappointed yesterday. In its first appearance in the Shanghai Basketball League, it was defeated by Zhenru by a large margin, with a result of 32 to 22 points. The score in the first half was 20 to 13. Referee: Shao Ji.</p>
<p>Youth's Strategic Errors; Zhenru Performed Very Well Yesterday. Huang Guanglin's shots were accurate and spectacular, with few misses. Because the situation was very slow, he was able to pass leisurely, with many good connections. Youth's defeat can be said to be due to strategic errors. The Chinese venue is larger than the Western Youth venue. Youth still used the old tactics of turning three or four times to shoot, not knowing that they were still far from the basket. Nineteen shots missed, and they never tried to break into the basket. How could they not lose? The whole team was scattered and the situation was not fast, with no excitement to speak of.</p>
<p>Zhenru Had a Smooth Ride. Although Youth's Cheng Jingxing opened the scoring first, Zhenru immediately chased out with 6 to 2 and 8 to 4, then 12 to 4, with a smooth ride, leading by a difference of eight or nine points. The first half ended with a score of 20 to 13, winning by seven points. At first, Youth used Diao Youdao as the right forward. Diao was a famous general who had not been on the field for a long time, and his skills were rusty. 　Lian En was then substituted, but there was still no improvement. Diao was put in again in the second half, but Zhenru still poured in, scoring 24 to 16. Zhenru then scored six points in a row, with an even greater difference, ending the game with a score of 32 to 22.</p>
<p>Zhenru Fouls and Scores; Youth Fouls and Scores</p>
<p>Huang Guanglin, Right, 0 Fouls, 15 Points, Diao Youdao, Right, 0 Fouls, 0 Points</p>

<p>The Elite Iron Army will play tonight, at 8:30 against Jianhua. Kong Guangyi and Xia Zeren have already returned to the team, so their strength has increased sharply. Jianhua is also a powerful team, with Chen Shiqiu and other generals, so it is worth watching. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Jiang Team │ 　Team B 1 5:30 Zhou Jiaqi</p>
<p>Seven Team │ Hold Middle School B 2 6:30 Chen Fuzhang</p>
<p>Quanguang │ Qingxin B 3 7:30 Wang Yiqiao</p>

<p>It is Internally Decided that Heissifron Was Seriously Injured</p>
<p>It was internally decided that Heissifron of the Shanghai team would serve as the center of the Inter-Port competition. However, Mr. He suffered repeated serious leg injuries in the Shanghai team's game against Lincoln in the Advanced Cup a few days ago. As a result, the Shanghai team failed to the game with a score of zero to five. In response to the selection of the center of the Shanghai team for the future Inter-Port competition, according to the transmission of the selection committee, it seems that this important task will be shifted to Dai Linjing of the Chinese team, because there are no other comparable people. In fact, Mr. Dai's skills and experience can definitely be up to the task.</p>

<p>Even with Four Donghua Generals</p>
<p>It Still Ended in Failure</p>
<p>A Scene from the Chinese Character Group Football League</p>
<p>In the Chinese Character Group of the Chinese Football Association, there was an unexpected result yesterday: the Lingnan team lost to the Youth team by zero to two. Although Lingnan had four generals, Li Yichen, Chen Hongguang, Chen Jiaqiu, and Chen Pu, they still ended in failure. The score in the first half was one to zero, with Youth's left inside forward Xu Buyun scoring. The score in the second half was also one to zero, with right inside forward Gu Yifei scoring again.</p>
<p>Reasons for Failure: Lingnan had previously defeated Jinan by three to one, while Youth had tied Jinan by one to one. When Lingnan defeated Jinan, Li, Chen Hongguang, and Chen Jiaqiu all served as forwards. Yesterday, they changed from attack to defense, with Li in the center, and the two Chens on the left and right, so the situation changed. The lineup yesterday was as follows:</p>
<p>Youth Team:</p>
<p>Wu Zhengxiang, Cao Chuxiong</p>
<p>Zhang Yangqian, Ma Wenjun, Xu Buyun</p>
<p>Wang Fengchun, Zheng Liankun</p>
<p>Zhang Pengnian, Xin Ziliang (Up), Gu Yifei</p>
<p>Tang Lu (Down), Zhu Xiaorong</p>

<h3 id="e139">Financial Gold Prices Weaken Last Week After Initial Sharp Rise <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Highest Nearly 700 Taels</p>
<p>Fluctuations Reached 38 Taels Throughout the Week. Gold prices last week still experienced drastic changes, with turbulent waves and unstoppable momentum. Daily differences reached over ten taels, leaving traders bewildered and at a loss. Consequently, supply and demand varied greatly. At the beginning of the week, momentum was still strong, with prices nearly reaching 700 taels. Afterward, a swirling pattern emerged until the end of the week, when the trend weakened sharply, plummeting to the 610-tael mark. The entire week saw a fluctuation of 38 taels, with a total decrease of 9 taels and 6 mace. This was mainly due to the overseas silver market first falling and then rising, resulting in a slight overall drop. The Shanghai market's exchange rate for British pounds shrank by half a notch, and the U.S. dollar exchange rate shrank by 0.875. Internal bank rates also slightly declined overall. Although British and U.S. exchange rates remained tight, the gold market moved in the opposite direction, greatly affected by the unsettled situation. Furthermore, news circulated from abroad that France had repeatedly withdrawn large sums of deposits from the U.S., and Germany intended to postpone war reparations, temporarily not making payments, all of which were unfavorable to the gold market. Consequently, hedging with exchange drafts gradually widened to over 50 taels, likely due to gold dealers colluding to create blank drafts to profit from arbitrage. This had a significant impact, pushing the settlement price of U.S. dollars from 50 taels to as high as 80 taels. For those who had not settled their two-month forward contracts for March, they initially had to pay over one tael to close the position. However, due to an oversupply of spot gold, they only needed to pay a few cents, and eventually, they even received a few cents. In the end, short positions had to pay two to three taels to close, a completely unexpected reversal. Furthermore, interest for red bar gold initially increased by ten taels, with Yufeng and Yongheng showing buying interest, but now only increased by four and a half taels. There were few consultants offering advice. The following is a summary of the week's developments:</p>
<p>Prices Continue to Fall by 9 Taels and 6 Mace. At the beginning of the week (January 18), Da Tiao Bank continued to shrink by 0.3125, and the silver price shrank by 0.375. The Xianling exchange rate initially shrank by 0.375, with the U.S. dollar at 0.75. Later, it was revised to a shrinkage of 0.25, with the U.S. dollar also at 0.25. Internally, Tingxiu Bank had high settlement volumes, and gold dealers were scrambling to collude. As for the gold market, it initially rose by 9 taels, reaching 688 taels, then 86 taels and 8 mace. Subsequently, due to excessive buying, it surged past 90 taels, reaching 96 taels and 8 mace. Later, large investors sold off, and the midday price was 89 and a half taels. In the afternoon, the market opened again at 93 taels, then retreated to 88 and a half taels, with selling pressure prevailing. By the close, it still trended upward, reaching 92 taels and 7 mace, a sharp increase of 13 taels and 9 mace compared to the previous Saturday. The day saw a fluctuation of 10 taels. On Tuesday, Da Tiao Bank further shrank by 0.375 to 0.3125, and the silver price shrank by 0.375. The Xianling exchange rate remained unchanged, and the internal rate remained flat. Dealers were scrambling to collude, with more covering than shorting. The gold market opened slightly higher by 8 mace, reaching 93 and a half taels. Due to unfavorable conditions and U.S. buying, news spread of a silver meeting, and prices fell from 95 taels to 92 taels. However, the exchange market tightened, reaching 99 taels. Then, with the U.S. dollar seemingly loosening, the midday price was 91 taels and 2 mace. In the afternoon, the market initially rose to 96 taels and 5 mace, then 98 taels. Due to large investors chasing purchases, Wu and others sold off, causing the price to fall back to 88 and a half taels. However, the closing price was 90 taels and 8 mace, slightly lower than the previous day by 1 tael and 9 mace, with a difference of 10 taels and 5 mace. On Wednesday, Da Tiao Bank rose by 0.125 to 0.1875, with the silver price unchanged. The local Xianling exchange rate remained unchanged, and the U.S. dollar shrank by 0.125, as the exchange rate tightened again. British and U.S. internal rates seemed to loosen, with little trading activity. The initial gold price was 92 and a half taels, an increase of 1 tael and 7 mace, as the silver price remained unchanged. However, conditions were still unfavorable, and the U.S. bought again. Soon after, prices retreated to 90 taels, but buying interest was strong, pushing the price up to 94 taels and 9 mace. However, although public bonds had opened, prices fell sharply. Furthermore, due to France withdrawing deposits from the U.S., sentiment was downward. The midday price was only 85 taels and 2 mace, and the afternoon opened at 83 and a half taels. Afterward, the market was relatively peaceful, with the closing price at 85 taels, a further drop of 5 taels and 8 mace. The entire day saw a difference of 11 taels and 4 mace. On Thursday, Da Tiao Bank slightly declined by 0.125, with the silver price unchanged. The Xianling exchange rate remained the same, and the internal British rate was flat while the U.S. rate shrank, due to exchange rate factors. However, dealers were heavily colluding. The gold market opened higher by 5 taels, reaching 89 taels, then 7 and a half taels. Later, as the exchange market strengthened, it rose to 91 taels and 9 mace. However, due to small spot transactions, large investors and banks sold off, causing the price to plummet by over 10 taels, reaching 79 taels and 8 mace. At midday, there were some buyers, and exchange drafts turned flat. The closing price was 83 taels and 9 mace, and the afternoon opened at 84 taels and 2 mace. Subsequently, due to rumors of a delay in German debt payments, the international community feared unexpected changes, causing widespread panic. The price fell to 78 taels and 5 mace. However, Yufeng, Yongheng, Wu, and others vigorously competed to buy, causing a surge of 12 to 13 taels, reaching 92 taels. The closing price was 88 taels and 8 mace, a large rebound of 3 taels and 8 mace compared to the previous day. The market saw a fluctuation of 13 taels and 5 mace. On Friday, Da Tiao Bank increased by 0.1875, and the silver price increased by 0.125. The Xianling exchange rate remained unchanged, and the internal rate saw an increase. The gold market opened slightly lower by 1 tael and 8 mace, reaching 87 taels, then 83 taels and 2 mace, and then 88 taels and 2 mace. However, selling pressure prevailed, causing a sharp decline. Yufeng, Yong and others competed to sell, causing the midday price to plummet to 69 taels. The closing price was 74 taels, and the afternoon opened at 71 and a half taels, as goods opened lower. The price retreated from 74 taels to 69 taels. Buyers were incessant, pushing the price up to 75 taels and 3 mace, then 70 taels and 5 mace. The closing price was 73 taels, and uncertainty caused prices to fluctuate greatly, a further decrease of 15 taels and 8 mace compared to the previous day. The day saw a high-low difference of 19 taels and 2 mace. On Saturday, Da Tiao Bank further increased by 0.375 to 0.3125, the silver market by 0.25, the Xianling exchange rate increased by 0.25, and the U.S. dollar also increased by 0.25. The internal British rate was firm and the U.S. rate was stable, due to exchange rate tightness. Gold dealers saw little trading activity. The initial gold price was slightly lower by 1 tael, reaching 72 taels, then 73 taels and 5 mace. Later, due to large investors such as Qian Changxiang acting on behalf of Banque de l'Indochine competing to sell, the price plummeted by over 10 taels, reaching 61 taels. Furthermore, due to strong buying, especially with the U.S. dollar remaining strong, the price rebounded. The midday price reached 70 taels, but poor sentiment caused the price to fall, retreating to 68 taels and 8 mace. The midday price was 69 taels and 2 mace, a further decrease of 3 taels and 8 mace compared to the previous day (a cumulative decrease of 23 taels and 4 mace over three days). The half-day also saw a fluctuation of 12 and a half taels, which can be considered enormous. The following is a breakdown of the high and low prices for British and U.S. silver markets, as well as exchange drafts and gold prices:</p>

<h3 id="e141">Ordinary Interest Rates and Soaring Guangdong Small Silver <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the market was typically quiet. The foreign interest rate in the market was very stable, with both morning and afternoon rates at 7 mace 1 fen 8 li 7 hao and a half, slightly better by several hao compared to the previous day. The silver loan rate in the morning was also 1 mace 3 fen, significantly higher by 3 fen compared to the previous day's afternoon rate. The situation was not critical. The amount of foreign exchange drafts made was 490,000 in the morning and 290,000 in the afternoon. There were no transactions in banknotes in either market. The amount of banknotes transacted outside the market was 55,000 in the morning and 40,000 in the afternoon. Banks were closed for the holiday and had no news. Money shops collected over 3.7 million in foreign public bills and over 32 million in silver public bills. Small money shops transacted 200,000 to 300,000, with over 200,000 from various sources.

<h3 id="e142">A Glimpse of the Difficulties of the Silver and Money Industry <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Inferior Goods Sealed and Not Sold</p>
<p>Securities Prices Depressed</p>
<p>Heavy Losses from Floods</p>
<p>The silver and money industry faces a significant challenge every time it solicits outstanding debts at the end of the accounting period. However, the difficulties this time are even greater than in previous years. The difficulties stem from: (1) Significant losses due to the seizure of inferior goods from various shops. The silver for the goods' price must rely on money shops for turnover. Now that the goods are sealed, there is no way to obtain cash. Although the debt collection is strict, there is no recourse. (2) The securities craze. Recently, due to difficulties in extending credit, the financial community has changed course, with many purchasing securities for profit. The sharp drop in securities prices has caused significant losses for the silver and money industry, as well as harming outsiders. Therefore, it is impossible to clear outstanding debts as desired. (3) Last year's floods caused damage to various commercial cities, and many merchants outside the affected areas were left with nothing. The goods were damaged by flooding, and the debt collection was delayed. If such a chaotic situation is not resolved, the silver and money industry will be in a difficult position. Due to the above three difficulties, there is no clear direction for this round of soliciting outstanding debts. According to the industry's announcement yesterday, only one-tenth or one-twelfth of the debts have been collected. This is a difficult situation never seen before in the commercial market.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Securities Prices Fall Several Yuan Again Last Week <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Unified Salt Tax and 20th Customs Tariff Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Last week (from January 18 to 23), the market conditions of various bonds at the local Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were such that the market was still inactive for the first two days of the week due to the unsettled situation. Later, the situation gradually improved. As the government clearly indicated its determination to maintain bonds, market sentiment improved, and the exchange decided to resume trading from Wednesday. Therefore, there were only four market days last week. Overall, the market was generally not quiet. A total of 161,000 yuan of spot goods were traded, including 29,200 yuan of salt tax, 26,000 yuan of the 20th Customs Tariff, 23,500 yuan each of demobilization and unified tax, 18,000 yuan of the 19th Customs Tariff, 13,000 yuan of the 20th Revenue, 12,000 yuan of the Unified Sixth Issue, 8,000 yuan of the 19th Charity, 6,000 yuan of the Demobilization Relief, and 2,000 yuan of customs duties. However, there was no market for the 96th Public Bond. Futures were more active on Wednesday, reaching 12.8 million yuan, and 8 to 9 million yuan on other days, totaling 37.845 million yuan. This included 3.80 million yuan of the January contract and 2.275 million yuan of the February contract for the 20th Customs Tariff, 3.785 million yuan of the January contract and 2.115 million yuan of the February contract for the salt tax, 3.16 million yuan of the January contract and 2.61 million yuan of the February contract for the unified tax, 2.7 million yuan of the January contract and 2.24 million yuan of the February contract for the 19th Customs Tariff, 2.67 million yuan of the January contract and 2.04 million yuan of the February contract for the 19th Charity, 2.595 million yuan of the January contract and 2.025 million yuan of the February contract for the 20th Revenue, 2 million yuan of the January contract and 855,000 yuan of the February contract for demobilization relief, 925,000 yuan of the January contract and 690,000 yuan of the February contract for demobilization, 525,000 yuan of the January contract and 25,000 yuan of the February contract for the 96th Public Bond, 395,000 yuan of the January contract and 10,000 yuan of the February contract for customs duties, and 400,500 yuan of the January contract for the Unified Sixth Issue. Regarding the price fluctuations of various bonds during the week, the market was initially very good on Wednesday, with enthusiastic buying interest from various parties, and prices generally rebounded slightly compared to the closing prices on the previous Tuesday. However, as large investors sold off, sentiment became weak again, and prices uniformly declined. Although prices fluctuated and rotated afterward, with no major ups and downs, the trend was consistently more downward than upward. For example, the unified salt tax and the 20th Revenue, whose prices had already fallen significantly, were now low, so the fluctuations throughout the week were relatively flat. The results were only about 1 yuan 3-4 jiao lower than the previous Tuesday for the unified salt tax, and slightly over 2 yuan lower for the 20th Revenue. However, the demobilization and 19th Customs Tariff, whose prices were higher than other bonds, would also be difficult to avoid if a consolidation was decided, so selling was particularly active in the market, and demand was very weak, resulting in the steepest price declines, with the results being about 4-5 yuan lower than the previous week. Other bonds also fell by about 3 yuan. Overall, the prices of various bonds were now quite close, ranging from 26-7 yuan to 35 yuan, with no higher prices. Observing the bond market, if the situation does not worsen or if there are no new developments, prices are not expected to fluctuate significantly in the short term. The following is a statistical breakdown of the high and low prices and fluctuations of various bonds in the four days of last week (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Active Sales in the South China Region</p>
<p>Actual cotton yarn sales were not bad last week. Activity was seen in the South China region, the Gangbang have fixed orders. The goods of various factories are sold out for the February-March futures period next year, and current spot goods are also scarce, so the market atmosphere is still tight. Japanese yarn prices are very low, tens of taels lower than Chinese yarn, and the practice of secretly changing brands is intensifying. The sales of local yarn have been seized considerably. This week, Yunnan and Guangdong Gangbang have the most purchases, with each Gang buying over 20,000 bales. Transactions are stable and smooth. Most scattered traders of standard yarn are inclined to sell, so the situation is bleak and lackluster, lacking vitality. Mid-month contracts are in good spot sales, and there are few deliveries this month, so buyers have a mindset to squeeze short positions, making the market tight. The highest price in the mid-month period once reached 157 taels and 3 mace, but weakened again at the weekend. As a result, each month increased by 7-8 mace to 1 tael compared to last week. The following lists the highest and lowest prices for the week:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Lowest Weekend Price Compared to Previous Week</p>
<p>January 156.0 154.9 155.7 Increase 1.20</p>
<p>February 156.8 155.4 155.4 Increase 1.10</p>

<p>April 157.3 155.2 155.5 Increase 0.50</p>
<p>May 157.3 155.4 155.4 Increase 0.50</p>
<p>June 157.3 155.3 155.4 Increase 0.30</p>
<h3 id="e145">Cotton Market Slightly More Active Last Week <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was quite active last week. As Indian cotton soared by more than 20 rupees, sentiment turned firm. At the same time, some manufacturers, seeing the high price of Indian cotton and the potential for profit, liquidated a lot of Indian cotton and switched to buying Chinese cotton to meet their needs. As a result, there was a momentary shortage of spot goods on the market. Last week, rumors circulated that Indian merchants would collect about 5,000 dan of goods on behalf of Japanese merchants this month, and Ningbo Gang also did not deliver, so this month became increasingly tight. The cotton pullback month was also lifted up by this. The situation turned slightly weaker on the weekend, due to rumors that Indian cotton fell back by more than 10 rupees, and the price of gold fell, so sentiment felt slightly softened. However, American cotton was very quiet this week. The price of standard flowers increased by 6-7 mace per month compared to last week. The following lists the highest and lowest prices for the week for Han Standard Cotton:</p>
<p>Han Standard Highest Lowest Weekend Price Compared to Previous Week</p>
<p>January 32.70 31.85 32.40 Increase 0.85</p>
<p>February 33.35 32.65 32.95 Increase 0.90</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was bleak, and traders took a wait-and-see attitude. The futures price fell by 12 pounds, and the spot price was unchanged. The British cotton futures and spot prices both fell by 2 points, and the Egyptian cotton spot price fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was closed.

<p>Yesterday's sources from South Shanghai were the 24th and 25th numbers, and sales were sluggish. Sukun white glutinous rice fell by 1-2 jiao. Tongli Beibai's arrival and sales were weak. Qingjiao sailboats, Tinglin Fenglian, and other early and late rice varieties were all lower by one chi. The situation has not rebounded. Du Yangjian and Tongbian were tight for the best and next best, but soft overall. According to telegrams from other ports, foreign rice was also imported in the past week.</p>
<p>Around 40 boats arrived at the New Gate, and market sales were weaker than before. Shops on both sides were preparing to close, so the situation was on the decline. Northern glutinous rice was the weakest, and arrivals were still strong, falling by 2 jiao. Early and late rice were unremarkable. There was a slight shortage of foreign port sharp-topped goods, and ordinary transactions were sporadic, with prices short by 5 fen. The river bottom market opened with 3,000 dan.</p>

<h3 id="e149">An Unprecedented Advertisement <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>It's a very misguided attitude to read the newspaper without looking at the advertisements. When I unfolded the newspaper yesterday morning, I seemed to see the big characters "Renouncing the Qualification of County Magistrate" in the advertisement column. I didn't pay attention at the time, and I flipped it over to national affairs.</p>
<p>Although these words were neglected by my attitude of neglecting advertisements, they had somehow left a very deep impression in my subconscious. So "Renouncing the Qualification of County Magistrate" ...... "Renouncing the Qualification of County Magistrate" ...... "Renouncing the Qualification of County Magistrate" ...... floated out of my mind one after another. Finally, I suddenly came to a conclusion, "Renouncing the Qualification of County Magistrate, I'm afraid it's not an ordinary advertisement!" I reopened the newspaper and found such a headline: "Former Liyang County Magistrate Li Jinfang Declares Renunciation of Jiangsu Province's Second Session of County Magistrate Qualification".</p>
<p>I carefully read the content from beginning to end and extracted the following facts:</p>
<p>(1) Li Jinfang was dismissed from his post by Pan Keping, the director of the Finance Bureau, who was recommended by Ye Chucang, the chairman of Jiangsu Province, for reporting Pan Keping's malfeasance.</p>
<p>(2) After being dismissed, Li Jinfang submitted the illegal acts of the provincial government in clearing up the case to the Supervisory Yuan and the Zhenjiang District Court;</p>
<p>(3) The Supervisory Yuan has filed an impeachment against the principal offender in the case, and Pan Keping has also been arrested and imprisoned by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs;</p>
<p>(4) The Jiangsu Province Examination Regulations clearly stipulate that the recommender should be punished if corruption is discovered in the recommended personnel, but Ye Chucang and others remained unscathed;</p>
<p>(5) Ye Chucang was the chief examiner of the second county magistrate examination in Jiangsu Province, so he had a teacher-student relationship with Li Jinfang. Li Jinfang followed Gu Tinglin's example of denying being a student of the traitorous official Qian Qianyi and voluntarily renounced the qualification of county magistrate and refused to receive the review diploma;</p>
<p>(6) Li Jinfang declared that he had obtained the qualification of county magistrate in the Hubei Political Affairs Committee, although it was useless, he was willing to keep it. If the above sections are completely true, then former county magistrate Li's statement contains important significance; the reason why this significance is important is because it contains a representative struggle - fighting out a clean county magistrate under corruption, on top of corruption, and in the midst of corruption.</p>
<p>Struggle is the grand avenue to building a clean government. We must be strict with ourselves and strict with our superiors in order to create a clean society.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>I recently read the Hunan Provincial Government's county administration report, which detailed the social customs of various counties. I have selected a few excerpts from the Miao customs of Yongshui County to share with readers.</p>
<p>Yongshui County is connected to Xiushan in Sichuan, Songtao in Guizhou, and Baojing, Fenghuang, Qiancheng, and other counties in this province. In Yongshui County, the Han and Miao people live together. In the county's upper and lower nine townships, upper and lower eight townships, upper and lower ten townships, and so on, there are fewer Han people and more Miao people. Their languages are mutually unintelligible, and they do not understand "Kehua" (Mandarin, commonly called "Kehua"). As a result, many Miao people do not understand government policies and other publicity. Currently, the government is paying special attention to education, and in addition to expanding schools, it is also ordering the learning of Kehua in order to eliminate the distinction between Han and Miao people and assimilate them.</p>
<p>Miao people do not believe in vaccination. They do not know about smallpox or cowpox at all. Therefore, even if someone dies from smallpox, the Miao people not only do not blame anyone but attribute it to fate and let nature take its course.</p>
<p>Whether in spring, summer, autumn, or winter, Miao boys and girls all wear wind caps on their heads. They do not remove them even in the hottest weather. In the severe winter, they do not remove their caps and still go barefoot. It can be said that they care for their heads but not their feet. Or is it simply a habit?</p>
<p>Land in Yongshui is used for military reclamation, and the economy is notoriously backward. What is used in the market and believed by the general public are mostly Sichuan copper coins worth 100 and 50 "cash," and single or double copper coins from this province are rarely seen. Even the Yuan head silver coins are often rejected by the Miao people. (Remainder omitted)</p>
<p>In Yongshui, the Han and Miao people live together, and their lives are extraordinarily simple. They eat two meals a day. For the Miao people, corn and sweet potatoes are the only source of nourishment. The people here are mostly accustomed to hard work. Both men and women are good at carrying things on their shoulders. Women often go barefoot and wear straw sandals, earning a living independently and not relying on men.</p>
<p>The Miao people in Yongshui account for seventy to eighty percent of the population. The customs and habits of the Han people are still common, but the Miao people are different. It is said that when someone dies, they only sing mourning songs and wail, and they do not usually follow the prescribed mourning clothes. When a woman marries, there is no betrothal or name asking. Only a matchmaker lights incense and sets off firecrackers as a form of engagement. Sometimes, men and women can choose their partners freely through singing to each other. Other things, such as spring social gatherings, dragon dances, New Year's dragon lanterns, lion dances, and swings, are especially lively. Although the Miao people are superstitious about ghosts and gods, they do not kneel before idols. Therefore, those who are relatively wealthy always prepare a cow in winter. They choose a date, tie it to a pillar, and stab it with spears. This is called "Chuiniu Jigui" (stabbing the cow to sacrifice to ghosts), also known as "Huan Nuoyuan" (returning the exorcism vow).</p>
<p>When Miao women give birth, they can also drink cold water without any danger. A Miao woman must marry several husbands before she dies. Marriage is not taken very seriously. In funerals, the maternal relatives are the most honored.</p>
<p>Han women in Yongshui do not step out of their chambers after the age of fourteen. Men have a capping ceremony at the age of twenty, with a banquet for guests. Relatives give names and do not restrict gifts. The customs are simple and ancient, and etiquette is still preserved.</p>

<p>(13) Passing Tianjin</p>
<p>Sangyuan is a town on the border of Yan (Hebei Province) and Lu (Shandong Province). Before the train started, I wanted to pay attention to the characteristics of this exotic landscape. How could I know that when we set off from Licheng, it was the first watch of the night when everything was silent. Coincidentally, that night my soul suffered under the iron hooves of Jinan. Therefore, I didn't even know when the train passed this important town of Sangyuan. What a pity!</p>
<p>I slept on the train for a night and sat on the train for a whole half-day the next day. From my own point of view, I can infer the common feelings of everyone. I think the comrades in this compartment are probably helpless against these boring times. The train's limbs suddenly stopped and then suddenly ran, indicating the names of places to us, as if to tell us not to forget this magnificent journey.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the whistle roared again as before. After a while, the two big characters "Tianjin" flashed across our eyes. The train slowly stopped as if it were wilting. At this time, the sound of people outside the window was noisy. Sturdy porters kindly greeted passengers in Northern Mandarin. There were also compatriots at the station welcoming us. But because we had to move forward immediately, we could only thank them for their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>This place is a famous commercial center in our country. Construction and transportation are well-equipped. Imperialists have long coveted it. Therefore, both sides of the Bai River are rented by foreign countries. Recently, the tyranny has been harassing Tianjin, relying on the land we rented to him to cause trouble. So, this misfortune of Tianjin is also the root of our own trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Talking About Stones <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Jia</p>
<p>The Yuhua Terrace stones in Nanjing have five colors. When placed in water, they are fresh, lively, and translucent, making them very lovely. During the late Qing Dynasty, every time there was an autumn exam, the vendors lining up in Maiyuan Street waiting for buyers were too numerous to count. The most precious ones were those with colors on the stone surface that formed the shapes of people or living things.</p>
<p>The Moso Mountain in Lijiang produces nephrite. The locals dig holes to extract it. When it first comes out, it is like gypsum, but it hardens when exposed to wind. Some look like jasper or agarwood jade, and they are very bright and transparent. The softer ones are like the stones from Qing Tian and Shou Shan caves. They are too brittle to be carved into seals but can be carved into wine vessels and water droppers. They can be given as local gifts and are called nephrite. There is also a type of black jade that is very solid. When it first comes out, it is green, but when it is touched with oil or sweaty hands, it becomes as black as lacquer. It is made into prayer beads and called Beifeng stone.</p>
<p>In Fujian, there is a Qingshan Mountain, which is the gateway to Putian. It produces "Xiangsi" stones, also called "male-female" stones. They are shaped like almonds and are white. When split, they have patterns inside. When placed on a plate and sprinkled with water, the two halves stand facing each other and then merge into one.</p>
<p>Meizhou in Fujian is located in the middle of the sea, with a circumference of over eighty miles. It is northeast of Chongwu and southeast of Pinghai, facing Ryukyu. The mountains produce black and white "Bo" stones, which can be used as chess pieces.</p>
<p>Seventy miles north of Lingbi County in Anhui Province, there is Qing Stone Mountain. (寰宇記 "Records of the Universe") says, "It is forty miles southwest of Xiapie County. Now, the Qing stones are taken to supply the Music Bureau. The floating Qing stones from Sishui in the Tribute of Yu are from here." Zhao Xihu wrote: Lingbi stones are found deep in the mountains, and they are only visible when dug. They are the color of lacquer, with thin white patterns like jade. They make a clear and far-reaching sound when struck. They cannot be scratched with a sharp knife. Fake ones are often made by dyeing Taihu stones.</p>
<p>Taihu stones are very precious. They have white patterns and make a slight sound when struck. Their exquisite and transparent parts are formed by water erosion, not by human work. However, genuine products are not easy to see. Forgers often wash and scrub them in water, removing their sharp edges. After several years, they sell them for a great profit. Only those with knowledge can distinguish them. Genuine ones have stone bones that have been eroded by waves. Over time, holes are formed naturally. Because they are in the water, they are difficult to transport.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people pile stones in gardens to create small mountains, which are called rockeries. The Sanfu Huangtu ("Maps and Records of the Three Capital Areas") records that Liang Xiaowang built the Tu Garden. The garden had Bai Ling Mountain, with rocks with names like "Fucun Stone," "Luo Yuan Rock," and "Xi Long Hillock." It also quotes the "Xijiuyiyi" saying that Yuan Guanghan, a wealthy man from Maoling, built a garden at the foot of the North Mountain, four miles east-west and five miles north-south. He channeled flowing water into it and constructed mountains with stones, over ten zhang high and extending for several miles. According to this, rockeries existed as early as the Han Dynasty. (Pi Rixiu's poem) "Children are not allowed to startle the secluded birds; medicinal herbs must be planted on the rockery."</p>
<p>The most precious Tian Huang stone is deep yellow like a ripe chestnut. The best ones are slightly transparent and have a crystalline radish shape. It is extremely precious when used for seals. Mao Qiling's "Hou Guan Shi Lu" ("Record of Stones Observed Later") calls the Tian Keng the best among the old collections of Shou Shan stones. It is also written as "Tian Huang" or "Tian Huang."</p>
<p>"Hua Ru Shi" (化乳石) is a type of pattern stone produced on Mount Tiantai Baohua. Its color is like tortoiseshell, and it is lustrous, firm, and clean. It can be used for books and paintings. (See "Tiantai Mountain Zhi" (天台山志).) Wang Mian of the late Yuan Dynasty first used "Hua Ru Shi" (化乳石) to carve seals, which was the beginning of stone seals. (See "Qixiu Leigao" (七修類稿).)</p>
<p>North of Zhaoqing City is the Seven Star Crags. Its stones are white and as lustrous as jade, and they can be used to make playthings.</p>

<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>An Autobiography by Movie Star Hu Die (Butterfly Wu)</p>
<p>After several days of traveling to Beiping (Beijing), I was mentally exhausted, but once I arrived in Beiping, the surprised and delighted feelings made me forget all the uncomfortable impressions. This is a kind of psychological change. Beiping is such a lovable place! Seeing the buildings in Beiping, I despise those eighty- or ninety-story foreign buildings in Shanghai. Listening to the local accent of the people in Beiping, I don't want to listen to the singing in foreign talkies anymore. I haven't been to Beiping for many years, and the changes in Beiping are certainly not few, but when I think of my past travels, I can still vaguely recognize them.</p>
<p>Work Begins After we identified the houses and negotiated everything, we started working. Mr. Hong Shen and Mr. Zhang Shichuan set a timetable, and we all followed it. We had to get up at six o'clock every morning and couldn't finish work until four o'clock in the afternoon. It seemed busier and more disciplined than in Shanghai. However, at that time, the footsteps of our group were almost regarded as a rare pleasure by the people of Beiping. Not to mention that during the filming of location shots, the audience outside the open-air theater was often standing full (not seated full), even outside our residence, the porters were often overwhelmed. But as for ourselves, in addition to busy work, we can no longer use unnecessary social interactions to reduce our rest time. Although many unfamiliar friends came to us to talk or take pictures, we always politely declined, "living in seclusion and keeping things simple" -- this was a plan that was decided before we even came.</p>

<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Yu and Liang Arrive Together, Causing the Feast to Break Up; Yin and Xing Avoid Each Other, Unknowing Who Lost the Enamel Box. When An Yutian saw that she was so unhurried, with so much delay and preparation before leaving, he was secretly suffering in his heart. But he couldn't go against her, so he had to order the tea boy to fetch water quickly. After a while, the water was brought. Liang Xiaoyun rolled up her sleeves, revealing a pair of jade arms like snow lotuses. She went to the washstand and slowly wrung the towel to wash her face. Then she washed her hands carefully again. But she still wasn't done. She then took out a small, crystalline, golden powder box from a handbag. She gently pressed the mechanism on the lid. With a "chi" sound, it opened, revealing a small round mirror. She then took out a small pink powder puff from the box and dipped it in some foreign fragrant powder. She kept rubbing it on her delicate cheeks that seemed to break with a touch. The skills were truly indescribably exquisite. If it were a normal day with nothing to do, it would be a pleasure for An Yutian to quietly watch the beauty put on makeup. But today, he was restless in his heart, thinking that Li Wenxia was about to barge in. He really didn't have the leisure to enjoy this eye candy in detail. One eye watched her slowly and leisurely taking care of her own makeup, but she didn't care how anxious others were in their hearts, as if she was deliberately wasting time just to make things difficult for others. He wanted to reach out and do the delicate work roughly, quickly finishing it so she could pack up and leave. But that was just what he thought. Not only did he not dare to boldly overstep and do the job for her, but even if he wanted to impudently urge her, his teeth would be chattering and he couldn't even hum. His other eye had nothing to do, so he often peeked at the alarm clock on the desk. He saw that it was taking the opportunity to make things difficult for him. The long and short hands were moving faster than any other day. In the blink of an eye, Liang Xiaoyun had only done half of her makeup, but the clock was about to move half an hour. This half hour was enough time for Li Wenxia to hire a car from the Normal University to get here. An Yutian secretly cried that everything was ruined, completely ruined. This time, the enemies were bound to run into each other, unavoidably. He reluctantly steeled his heart, resolved to deal with both sides. At this critical moment, seeing that this three-way love tragedy was about to begin, he was preparing to go on stage and join the performance. It was useless to just be alarmed and anxious.</p>

<h3 id="e155">A Small Lesson from Watching a Movie Preview <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>For a long time, I haven't gone to see movie previews. The other day, ×× Film Company kindly sent me two invitation tickets because their first talkie "......" had been completed. They had a preview at the Carlton Theater. I was moved by curiosity, so yesterday (24th) at 11:00 AM (the invitation ticket said 11:30, but I arrived half an hour early), I drove there.</p>
<p>At that time, the American sailors were also at the Carlton, holding their "......" worship service. It hadn't finished yet. The invited comrades (not the party comrades, but the theater-watching comrades) and their lovers ...... had to wait outside the door, chatting about their love stories.</p>
<p>Finally, with a "Amen" sound, the double doors opened, and the men and women comrades swarmed in, each fighting for a place. After the seats were set and the line of sight was concentrated, they hoped for the blessing of eye pleasure. Unexpectedly, after stretching their necks for a long time, Mr. Zhou came out from behind the curtain. First, he reported the difficulties in making the film "......" and the economics of the preparation time. Then he said:</p>
<p>"I am sorry that several segments of the '......' film are still being reviewed in the capital and have not yet been obtained. Since they have not yet been obtained, we cannot open it today. Please come to the ×× Theater on time tomorrow, and we will be honored by your presence."</p>
<p>Hearing this report, the comrades all hung their heads in disappointment, clicking their tongues in dissatisfaction. But what I don't understand is, since the film hasn't arrived in Shanghai, why issue invitation tickets in advance? Even if it's for economic and time reasons, issuing them in advance, then by the time of the opening, they must have known the film hadn't arrived. Why didn't the company report it earlier, so as to avoid the comrades waiting for a long time, resulting in great disappointment?</p>
<p>Moreover, government agencies do things based on their "happiness". When they are "happy," they immediately review. When they are "unhappy," delaying for ten or half a month is not rare. If they still haven't gotten it now, and we go there tomorrow, running in vain again, what can we say?</p>
<p>Although this is just a trivial matter, it doesn't matter if we don't see it. But the way Chinese people do things often makes people lose faith. This can be seen here. After Mr. Zhou finished his report, another gentleman reported:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, please sit down and don't get up. The invitation tickets received today must be returned one by one." After the report was finished, the tickets were started to be returned.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, some comrades didn't listen to the report and swarmed forward, surrounding the ticket clerk, like the situation on Wangping Street. Seeing this situation, the ticket clerk shouted "No issuing!" "No issuing!" incessantly. As a result, the "radicals" achieved their goal, and the "moderates" were completely disappointed.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, I couldn't help but have a deep impression. Chinese people not keeping order and not caring about public welfare has become their second nature. So everywhere, we can see facts of them destroying order and disregarding public morality occurring.</p>
<p>Therefore, I got a small lesson. People who destroy order and disregard public morality completely achieve their rights and goals, while people who generally abide by the rules and respect order are completely disappointed. Assuming that the same thing happens again in the future, the people who follow order, learning from the past, will also be assimilated.</p>
<p>Ah! Although this is a small matter in a movie theater, I'm afraid it's still a microcosm of the entire China?</p>

<h3 id="e157">Talking About Carbon Dioxide - Meng Fu <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide is a compound of carbon or carbonaceous substances and oxygen. Its chemical name is carbon dioxide (Carbon Dioxide) and its formula is (Co2). This gas is commonly found in the atmosphere, but not in large quantities. Roughly, in rural and open areas, the air contains four parts per ten thousand, while in urban and populated areas, the air contains roughly one percent.</p>
<p>The combustion of all fuels, the respiration of living things, and the decay of animals and plants can all produce this gas. Moreover, in volcanic areas, it erupts from the strata. Here are a few examples: near Naples in Italy, there is a cave that emits carbon dioxide. In Yellowstone Park in the Americas, there is a Death Gulch, where living things suffocate and die upon entering because it contains a large amount of carbon dioxide. However, although nature constantly produces carbon dioxide, the amount contained in the air remains roughly the same. This is because plant leaves use sunlight to perform a kind of assimilation, which decomposes the absorbed carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen, absorbs the carbon to form starch and carbohydrates, and releases fresh oxygen. Therefore, plants are of great importance to human life.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is a colorless and odorless gas that causes suffocation but is not poisonous. It also has a characteristic that lime water can combine with carbon dioxide to produce a milky white precipitate. Therefore, we can use this method to test for carbon dioxide: cover a candle flame with a glass, and after a few minutes, pour clear lime water into it, and then shake it vigorously, and the clear lime water will gradually turn milky white. Or, you can exhale your breath into clear lime water, and you will get the same result. If you want to obtain a large amount of carbon dioxide using chemical methods, you only need to inject dilute hydrochloric acid (this acid is commonly used) into marble (i.e., calcium carbonate Calcium Carbonate), and you will get it.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide has a wide range of uses. I have written down the common and important ones below:</p>
<p>(1) Beverages丨The soda water that relieves the heat in summer uses high pressure to dissolve a large amount of carbon dioxide in the liquid, or soda water is made from baking soda and citric acid. Beer and other beverages also use carbon dioxide as a refreshing and beneficial drink.</p>
<p>(2) Fire Extinguishing丨Fire extinguishers sold on the market are made using the principle that carbon dioxide can isolate oxygen and does not support combustion. The general method is as follows: a small bottle containing concentrated sulfuric acid is suspended in a solution of heavy soda (Sodium bicarbonate). If a fire occurs, quickly invert the fire extinguisher, and the small bottle will break, the two liquids will combine to generate carbon dioxide, and the gas can be used to spray out the liquid. Sometimes, even if the fire is large, this device can be effective. A certain fire extinguisher manufacturing company in Shanghai has carried out multiple on-site tests in public, and the results have been very satisfactory. Science is truly omnipotent!</p>
<p>(3) Liquid Carbon Dioxide丨If the temperature is lowered and the pressure is increased, carbon dioxide will become a colorless liquid. It can be loaded into steel cylinders and supplied to people who manufacture soda water and other beverages. Recently, liquid carbon dioxide has been loaded into steel cylinders as fire extinguishers. Then, the carbon dioxide is still transformed into a gas and vented, because when the mechanism is opened, the pressure is reduced and the temperature is increased. Therefore, the liquid still returns to being a gas. In Europe and the United States, some electrical factories, cotton powder factories, and ships have used this device.

<p>Every day, for work, I have to pass through the area of North Sichuan Road Bund Sima Road. I often see beggars without feet below the shinbones, regardless of the weather. They flow and cry, "Gentlemen! Ladies! Do good deeds!" Their voice is sad and miserable! People passing by intentionally or unintentionally throw one or two copper coins into their broken baskets. They still push the broken baskets and flow! Cry! These tragic sounds and tragic sights are forever never heard nor seen by the gentlemen and ladies who glide past in cars.</p>
<p>In these tragic sounds, we have to ask why their feet are gone?</p>
<p>No more than three ways:</p>
<p>(1) Chopped off as a cruel punishment for a crime, or slowly rotted away by cruel punishments (such as standing in a lime bucket ......)!</p>
<p>(2) Blasted away by the ruthless bullets of guns and artillery during wartime!</p>
<p>(3) Disabled due to an extremely unfortunate accident!</p>
<p>If the disability was obtained in (1), then how cruel is this punishment! For the sake of respecting the complete health of human limbs, there is a real need for rectification. If it was obtained in (2), then how cold is society to the heroes who endure wind and rain for the country and the race!</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place of international concern, allowing these disabled people to flow and cry on the streets is enough to expose the weakness of the municipality. A disabled people's home should be urgently established to settle these miserable people who are on the verge of death.</p>

<h3 id="e159">The Life of a Worker, Big Brother <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>There are three classes in society. The propertied class naturally lives a superior life. The working class can also manage. But it is the white-collar class that is neither up nor down that feels the most difficulty. Hypocritical appearances cannot be exposed. The meager monthly salary is even less than that of a worker. After deducting household expenses, there are still personal consumption and social expenses, so there is always no surplus. It is difficult to add a piece of clothing without the risk of living beyond one's means. If the heavens do not bless you and you get sick, medical expenses can only be obtained from debt. If you break your rice bowl and lack recommendations, or for the sake of saving face, you are unwilling to stoop to becoming a worker, then you will inevitably fall into decline and destitution. A worker with a skill does not have to worry about finding a place to eat. This is the advantage of a worker in making a living.</p>
<p>Workers in China originally had no status. They have always been regarded as "trivial pursuits," so their lives are the simplest. Four or five unmarried people rent a loft together. Married people rent a pavilion or back building for four or five yuan. Food costs four or five yuan, and clothing costs three or four yuan. That is all the monthly expenses. If the monthly income is 20 yuan, there is already a surplus. They live in humble dwellings, eat poorly, and wear shabby clothes, and no one cares about it. (People would say that the white-collar class is having bad luck.) However, since the revolution in 1927, workers have occupied a considerable position, and wages have increased a lot. Ordinary workers can earn more than 40 yuan a month. There are still a few factories where workers are demanding pay increases. Frankly speaking, the work of workers is very hard. Who doesn't need a pleasant and comfortable life? Some of them have rich experience, high skills, and many family members, and they feel insecure because their wages are too low. It is hoped that the capitalists will consider the situation and increase their wages. There are also quite a few workers who have no family burden; or even if they have a surplus, they spend it on improper expenses, and therefore feel that their wages are not enough. Let me give a few examples:</p>
<p>(1) A certain worker's income is still acceptable, and his household expenses are extremely frugal, with half of his monthly income left over, but he often goes to gambling dens, resulting in heavy debts.</p>
<p>(2) A certain worker is single and has no family burden, but he likes fancy clothes and decorations. When he goes out after work, he looks like a young gentleman, so he cannot make ends meet.</p>
<p>(3) A certain worker likes to patronize prostitutes and has a mistress.</p>
<p>(4) Some factory workers spend money recklessly after receiving their wages, not even waiting overnight, and have nothing left.</p>
<p>(5) A certain female worker's family situation is average. Her monthly salary is enough to support herself, but her attire is like that of a rich woman.</p>
<p>What I said above is indeed the weakness of some workers, not slandering them, and even less is it intentional to criticize them. Because I have discovered the above-mentioned weaknesses, I cannot bear to remain silent, so I have spoken frankly and unceremoniously. If you read it and correct your mistakes if you have them, and strive to do better if you don't, this is my personal hope, and it is also the happiness of the country and society!</p>

<p>× French Troops Assist Government Troops in Attacking the City (Continued)</p>
<p>The Small Swords Society had set up artillery positions at what is now Chenjia Wooden Bridge. Larer ordered them to be dismantled, but the Swords Society refused. Larer then joined forces with the government officers to capture the county seat. They first attacked the north gate, near the present-day Catholic Church on Yangjingbang. The French troops attacked fiercely, destroying a corner of the city wall, but because they did not receive assistance from the government troops, their efforts failed. Two French officers were killed, four were wounded, and thirty-two soldiers were wounded and seven were killed. After this battle, the government troops built a long wall from the Bund to the intersection of Henan Road, across the large wooden bridge over Yangjingbang (i.e., Chenjia Wooden Bridge), to cut off traffic between the city and the concession. The city was cut off from outside aid and became increasingly difficult to sustain. On February 17, 1854, the Swords Society withdrew from the county seat, which had been occupied for seventeen months. When the government troops entered the city, the order was in great chaos. The eastern part of the city was completely destroyed by fire. The government troops captured the bandits and immediately beheaded them, and the slaughter was not small.</p>
