<p>時評</p>
<h3>告日本國民又玄</h3>
<p>小引</p>
<p>最近日本外交時報十一月上旬號半澤玉城氏發表「再告中國國民」一文。黨其「告中國國民」發表之初。我國湯爾和氏及外交評論湯中氏。均曾爲文答覆半澤而日本外交時報。原爲與外交有關諸人所辦。但現已改變其素昔態度。肆意爲其軍國主義張目。半澤氏兩次告中國國民。其爲文之出發點。均在於剌激其本國國民。并爲軍國主義辯護。吾儕讀之。固感覺極度不快。然日本之於我國。已由假想敵人進而爲正面敝人。是故於此種奇異論調。不能不加以注意。爰於譯載半澤原文之外。作「告日本國民。」</p>
<p>㈠日本已走入岐途</p>
<p>日本之爲軍國主義國家通現世界各地無不盡知自九一八事變之後。此種十八世紀之遺。物乃分外發達加以日本軍閥造作事實。激動日本國民。所謂煽動的「敝愾同仇。」致日本國民遂如得燒熱病者然。不顧所謂事實之眞僞。更不管事理之是否恰當。只論利益不聞其他於是舉國若狂。從事於侵略我東北之舉矣。其侵略之唯一口實於萬寳山案中村案之外則有所謂「滿濛生命綫」「國防綫」問題以狂惑其國民以欺騙世界以侵略我中國名爲保持遠東和平實則破壞和平。名爲在東方張開防俄戰綫。預防赤化。實則獨占東三省。實現其大陸（侵略）政策者也。然而此種狂熱心理早已不堪理喻。然吾人所欲告者。非酖於軍國主義之狂人。乃爲頭腦比較清醒不爲一時情感所矇蔽之有識者故於半澤氏再告中國國民一文。不必加以逐條之辯駁。不過於半澤氏之「謬見。」不能不加嚴正之指責。以明世界尙有「眞是非」也。</p>
<p>㈢半澤氏之謬見</p>
<p>半澤氏一再「告中國國民」其着眼點約有兩端一則主張中日直接交涉擺開國聯拘束二則望中國有恒久之鞏固政府以上兩點在九一八事變之初吾人對於向國聯乞憐始終反對然求公理正義之伸張則决不稱讓故我國眞正輿論自始即未嘗依賴國聯多數民衆雖呻吟於帝國主義鐵蹄之下亦自始即誓以自力求更生之道至於對日直接交涉一事城下之盟古人所恥而現在事實我中國人亦萬不能抛棄民族利益而甘心任人之蹂躪也中國之政府乃中國人之内政决不容外人置喙半澤之言實亦狂悖之甚者也</p>
<p>日本一般輿論多爲承認「滿洲（傀儡）國辯護其實「滿洲國」之爲傀儡爲日本軍人所製造之傀儡非特立於敵對地位之華人所審知即固見甚深之國聯調查團亦深知所謂「滿洲國」者特日本軍人官吏所一手製造者也設無日本軍隊集中東北無日本官吏雜居「滿洲」則「滿洲國」將立即塌台其所謂「自衛權」之發動亦屬完全飾詞絶非事實捨此二者外「滿洲國」爲日本製品已屬彰明顧著之史實矧日本官吏在傀儡政府中其數竟達六百餘人大小實權均操諸日吏之手縱令在「滿洲」（傀儡）國四」曁遍貼「無領土野心」標語其誰信之</p>
<p>㈢日本侵略東北之結果</p>
<p>當前世界經濟恐慌愈趨深刻日本在世界諸工業國中較爲後進故表面上受病似較美德爲淺然而五十萬失業工人七十億農村負債已足以表現日本之衰退乃彼軍閥者以爲一旦對外有事挑起戰爭擴張領土則一切困難均可迎槍刃而解矣自去年九一八迄今爲時一年有餘日軍帶甲十萬横行三省不可謂不雄矣且也武藤信義以一身而兼任駐滿大使關東州長官又領駐滿軍司令三位一體其權不可謂不大其勢不可謂不兇猛而於肉搏相抗之東北義勇軍竟至無可奈何</p>
<p>以十萬之兵保護二十萬僑民之安全實爲世界空前之奇事數日前日内瓦暴動以一萬軍隊維持治安已爲識者竊笑其十五人即有一兵開世界之奇聞殊不知日本軍閥侵略「滿洲」乃每兩個日僑即有一兵又豈非奇中之奇耶年糜三億日金以上之巨欵其所得者幾何吾人之善隣其思之重思之</p>
<p>㈣日本國民應有之覺悟</p>
<p>中日兩國同文同種且同立於東亞其文化歷史關聯與夫利益關係與隔一重洋之英美相比又更親切而其間横亘軍國主義致中日國民間結成民族的百年仇恨不易解除爲今之計吾人固亦甚願中日兩國之携手而目前難題在日本而不在我國故中日間難題之解决必先附以下之先决條件</p>
<p>一日本必須抛棄侵略政策歸還我東北三省</p>
<p>二日本尤須磪實廢棄軍國主義而後和平乃可維持</p>
<p>必如是而後日本當前之經濟恐慌方有解决希望東亞之安全乃得保障確實日本國民諸君以其理性考量之其熟思之勿儘恃其一時之横以遺禍於百年也</p>

<p>▲國民社十五日胡佛總統專車電美國胡佛總統對於戰債現擬再允債務國延長停付期至少一年倘民主共和兩黨領袖對此俱能同意則將據此答復英法</p>
<p>據今日表示、胡佛總統以爲各債務國、在英法領袖之下、定將共起要求减讓或取銷、故認目前最良之臨時解决法莫如延長停付期、蓋胡佛深信前此之停付債務、曾拯救歐洲免遭財政上更進一憎之混亂、而美國亦得以保待國外市塲、同受其利、今若延長停付期、則各方均蒙其利、世界商務將受其益、倘經濟狀况能略見回蘇、則債務國勢將不能堅持减讓或取銷矣、</p>
<p>聞總統回京後、將草擬延長停付計劃、待羅斯福及其顧問來京、持以詳細商榷、一面再徵詢共和黨領袖意見、俟得各方同意、即予實行、據稱胡佛計劃、擬定一重行付欵之確定日期、但將來與英法代表、開談戰債全部問題後、仍可臨時變更、蓋胡佛信一而延長停付期、一面允談判戰債間題、此項辦法、英法當能接受、惟胡佛亦自知此項計劃、或將在國會遇頑强之反對、因今日已接電告、在下屆國會衆院有議長希望之雷奈、業已宣稱、現國會或下屆國會内、贊成延長付欵之希望絶微云、</p>

<h3>德國仍不願參加軍縮會議</h3>
<p>因法國不承認軍備平等</p>
<p>路透社十五日柏林電　巴本政府官塲發言人稱、法國在日内瓦提出之軍縮計畫、未必能使德國迅速復參加軍縮會法國計畫、係依照法國著名理論組織歐洲政治機關之計畫、德國不反對歐洲陸軍標準化之觀念、惟將軍火交與國聯管理、而由國聯分撥於被攻國之提議、則可視爲奇談云、德國非俟歐洲依允其軍備平等之權利後、不欲參加軍縮會、而法國則堅决不允承認此種權利、</p>
<p>路透社十五日日内瓦電　法國縮减軍備保障安全之提議、現已提交軍縮會主幹部者、已引起不少好感、但據一般批評、法國計畫至爲複雜、此間美代表對日本外交時報近載半澤玉城氏一文、題爲「再告中國國民」、文中對東北事件、完全諉咎於中國、自己却脫卸凈盡、且以直接交涉誘惑我國人、立意措詞、殊爲謬妄、本報於時評欄已爲文駁之、而將半澤原文譯載於此、讀者當知日人之詭辯技倆、實無所不用其極也、</p>
<p>上海事件以後、中國國民諸君、似乎已覺悟到了排日政策不可、似乎已體騐到了專靠國際聯盟或像美國似的第三國勢力來壓迫日本、事實是已完全失敗、同時、更深深的自覺到了希望終局的解决、就不能不根據中日直接的查涉過夫我們對中國政府及中國國民諸君、曾經下過一個極人的勸告、這勸告之要旨是第一、中國應該首先撤回對聯盟的滿洲問題的申請書第二、中國應該趕緊樹立起一個鞏固而　久、同時担當得起能中日直接交涉重任的政府、假使中國眞能夠實行這兩固條件、那末、我們也不惜愼重考慮一下過去中國諸君所悲鳴而認爲最後面目問題的滿洲宗主權問題、這個勸告、似乎也曾博得了中國與論若干的反響、同時促起了多數識者相當的考慮、結果中國政府的現實政策、却違背了我們的勸告、不僅沒有撤回對聯盟的申請書同時更新派了顧維鈞爲聯盟全權代表、鼓吹起各種排日方針、繼着直接間接的抗日政策、依然沒有變換它依賴聯盟的政策、</p>
<p>二　這個結果、時局是如何淮展呢、在日本、已正式承認了滿洲國在世界惡化了對華的認識、不僅這樣、李頓報告書公表後、暴露了中國的現實、引起了世界對華輿論的反感、過去的對華同情論、今日已成曇花泡影、這些事實、難道不是中國國民諸君應該自省的嗎</p>
<p>然而這些旣成事實、究竟是如何的展開呢、現在我們先說一下日本承認滿洲的　　罷、日本的承認滿洲國、誠然對於中國足一個困難的問題、中國的外交、誠然是因爲日本承認滿洲國而陷入於僵局、但是這個决不是日本故意要使中國困難、要使中國外交陷於僵局這實在是稱勸告、希望中國能撤回對聯盟的申報書、能宣佈中日直接交涉的誠意而不自陷於困難或僵局之中同時、在滿洲國承認前的日本、的確有過這樣很顯明的態度、在那時祗要對手方能有容納這提議的懇量、（日本在聯盟當力說中日直接交涉）然而中國政府不僅是没有容納了我們的勤告反而出之以逆行的態度結果、日本斷然承認滿洲國了、假使拿春秋的筆法而言、「中國以抗日政策及聯盟依賴主義、終使日木承認滿洲國焉」</p>
<p>三　更爲使中國國民諸君便於理解起見、再說明一下滿洲國承認的意義罷、日本承認滿洲國的結果、滿洲旣不是做了日本的領土、也不是做了日本的殖民地、而滿洲國反而可以因爲日本的承認而具備了獨立的主權滿洲國是　得了並不以日本之自由爲自由的對等權威、因此、單就日本國的便宜而言、與其承認滿洲國有對等主權而增是將來的憂慮毋寗運是與中國訂立了嚴重的條約、確定了滿洲的性質、較爲有利譬如從來的關東州、在法理上是寄託在中國主權之下的地域、但依據中日條約、日本己有了租借權、幾乎是完全的統治權、像這樣紙上的主權有什麽呢、在確定滿洲性質的時候我們對於主權、己不認爲是什麽重大的問題、何况乎是宗主權呢然而中國政府不是沒有考慮到這此問題嗎、不是沒有給與評論這問題的機會　這個看中國的不撤回對聯盟申請書不宣布中日直接交涉的誠意不就是一個很好的證據嗎、所以、在日本看來不能不認爲中國政府、是已抛棄了滿洲主權宗主權及一切一切的發言權了、這個事實中國國民諸君、不能不記憶一下、</p>
<p>四　因此、在事實上、滿洲是無主的地域、日本要占領也可以、要併合也未始不可以、然而日本已屢次向世界宣言、日本對於滿洲是沒有何種野心、當然日本是不想直接統治滿洲、同時也不想滿洲有賴於中國、有賴於聯盟、不得已、祇能容認現地之獨立運動、最近已正式承認了滿洲政府滿洲的統治祇能希望着滿洲住民自己的才能、這此、都是日本政策的本旨、換言之、日本因爲要避免併合滿洲的嫌疑起見、不得不承認滿洲的獨立、這個祇須看日本　就承認的問題、不惜化去了半載餘的歲月、在這個期間襄、給與了中國以十二分考慮的機會、給與了中國以研究最善手段的餘裕、然而中國政府、不原諒日本的眞意、不容納我們的勸告、終於使滿洲確定了今日的地位</p>
<p>所以、滿洲國的出現、並不是日本從中國那裡拿過來的、是中國自己抛棄的、因爲中國自己不行使他的發言權、結果、滿洲國　獨立日本纔承認、若使這裏有對於這旣成事實抱異　的中國人、那末告訴你、與其怨恨日本、毋寗還是責備你自己政府不好、來得適當、與其責備自己政府不好、還是　來　彈抗日政策與聯盟依賴策的失敗罷、這一些是　要中國國民諸君對於滿洲國問題反省的</p>
<p>五　其次、再講到國際聯盟與中國的關係、去年以來、中國以爲國際聯盟是唯一救世主、以爲哭訴於國際聯盟、一定可以買得聯盟的同情、然而今天的事情、是怎樣、先論討一下中國朝野期待着的李　報告書罷、當然、日本對於這報告書是要加以嚴　的批判、但報告書對於中國、是不是無條件的有利呢、賢明的中國國民諸君、應該省察一下、假使中國根據這　報告、根據這報告書所昭示着的國際聯盟對華意識、未來的中國、將如何受着聯盟支配呢、</p>
<p>第一、是滿洲問題雖說中國諸君絶呌着恢復失地、懇求着聯盟調查國的同情、熱望滿洲還元、但李頓報告書已明白說、「恢復去年九月以前的狀態已經是不可能了、」同時提唱着樹立起一個廣汎範圍的「自治」制度、在這個自治政府裏、以日本人占充分比額爲條件以外、旁的内容雖然不很明瞭、但他方而、認爲不考慮着日本與滿洲的歷史關係、什麽解决方法都歸無效的、同時、提唱着用有效的憲兵隊、維持滿洲内部的秩序、從這些看來、滿洲的自治、是以日本現有勢力爲基準的自治、它之所謂憲兵隊、當然是指現在日本的滿洲駐屯軍、果然是這樣、那末日本的獨立承認與李頓報告書的滿洲解决案、不過是低一重的差異而已、這裏、所不同的、祇僅是國際聯盟之能否掌握滿洲干涉之機會而已、同時、調查團對滿認識的根本、是立脚在中國本部與滿洲不能不分别着施政的源泉、因此中國的所謂失地恢復、調醒團已下了一個「不可能」的斷案這裏、中國國民諸君、還期待着聨盟解决滿洲問題嗎、</p>
<p>六、　第二是中國自身的問題根據李頓報告書的預言、實在已經構作成中國國際管理的前提了該報告書之文章、都是卓越的外交家所執筆、自然那記述是非常的巧妙而婉曲、但是根據調查團的「中國觀」而論中國政治的不安中日關係的障害都是遠東和平之癌、世界和平之危懼、這些「不安」都是由於中國的無鞏固之中央政府因此爲求實行中國内部改造起見、必須有一時的國際協力所謂國際協力當然就是國際管理、在報告書裡雖說沒有說明了他的方法、但很明顯的該報告書所提唱的宗旨是說中國的内亂政治的紛爭社會的經濟的不安、必然的要影響及於與中國有關係的諸國家之不安、給與了世界和平以一重脅威、因此不能不藉國際協力以解决了這些動亂這　中國期待於聯盟調查團的意義是暗晦了在中國原想恃爲律師的調查團結查反成了推事而判决了中國是有罪然則、中國是否是想向着世界暴露了自己的黑暗面、喚起了國際勢力之重壓纔招待着調查團而控訴日本呢還是中國一方面想抗擊着日本、一方面想甘受着歐美諸國重壓的意義呢、聰明的中國國民諸君這時候總應該冷靜的玩味一下這提案了罷、</p>
<p>七　關於李頓報告書、在中國應該省察玩味的實在是很多在這裏最該留心的、當然是滿洲自治案與中國國際管理案的　點、然則國際聯盟自己的空氣是怎麽樣呢、最近已　有了一個非常的變化假使「聯盟空氣」這句話、是有語的時候那末我們可以說内外領導國聯的英國法國義大利德國就是美國對於滿洲問題的輿論傾向却已經是變化了「日本侵略中國一中國是有組織的文明國」、原來國際聯盟的緊張就是從這些錯誤的前提上出發的現在歐美各國已經把這個前提放棄了、完全是站在新的認識之卜來觀察中日問題這個結果像李頓的報告書、歐美的政府及輿論已經瞭解遠東的特殊性再不拿西歐的國際常識來輕輕的卜一個判斷了現在煩惱聯盟大國頭腦的問題是歐洲自身的緊急問題聯盟自身的浮沉問題、換言之在這些問題之前滿洲問題是個非常小的問題了假使聯盟内爲一個滿洲問題要考慮或是失了日本、或是夫了中國的時候、當然决不至於因爲中國而失掉日本吧因此在未來的聯盟會議上國際聯盟因爲中國的原故、檢火裏的栗子、而破壞了聯盟自身像這樣愚昧的事情我們想是不至於的最近各國的輿論、已經是轉變爲折衷的親日的了就是美國的史訂生也不能不在這些輿論之前、縅守着沉默這些事實、難道不是中國國民諸君應該猛省的第一問題嗎、</p>
<p>八　然而中國國民諸君、現在還期待國際聯盟嗎、還打算呌國際聯盟做中國的救世主麽、把運命託咐他麽、假使中國果然能　依賴着國際聯盟而打開國運的時候、日本的利益、就是犧牲也不妨、「也决不至於可惜放手滿洲」但是、聯盟的意思、已經在李頓報告書裏而露了些鱗爪了、眞正的意思是中國的國際管理、是白人的亞細亞征服、牠們正希望着中日的紛爭而磨煉牠們遠東掠取的爪牙呢這個彷彿中日戰爭後的＝國干涉、＝國干涉後的遠東租借、同時、也像當年北洋系的政治家、誘引列國的勢力、開了瓜分中國的端緒、現在國民黨政寗錯　的聯盟依賴策、打開了中國國際管理的端緒、這些都已經是很顯明的事實了、中國的國民諸君、對時局的現狀、不起義憤嗎、</p>
<p>本來、歐美人對於東洋的國際政治、東洋的民族心理是不很明　、因此日本的一貫方針是不使歐美干涉東亞的問題、因此中日紛爭、應該根據中日直接交涉而解决、日本自身、不僅没有提訴到國際聯盟、而且有機會的時候、總隱蔽了中國的國　、打碎了各國的對華計劃（例如臨城事件待的中國鐵道管理案）　護中國的獨立主權、像這一次把中日問題提出了國際聯盟、聯盟的判斷、是以中國國際管理爲前提、這個完全是意料中的事情、因些日本對於去年的突發事件、就不想要希望聯盟的判斷、每當中國在聯盟咆哮的時候、日本總主張中日直接　涉總希望事態的圓滿收拾、然而中國政府以國際聯盟的不明瞭東亞事件、爲奇貨司居、强狠的讒訴日本、强狠的招請聯盟的干涉、結果、不祗是招來了今日的旣成事實搆成了國際管理的前提嗎、同時這個問題、實在是關係於東亞全局、東亞全民族　命的問題、而决不是一滿洲問題而已、因此聰明的中國國民諸君、第一須推　這　　　第二須、掃招來滅亡國　的政府與賣國政客、一新日已的國策、（孫懷　譯）</p>
<p>此計畫似尙贊同、因可視爲應合德國平等電備要求、並使德國復參加軍縮會之基礎也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十五日倫敦電　某保守黨議員今日下午詢問首相麥克唐納、謂法國關於軍縮及安全建設之計畫、旣已公佈、英政府、是否能對議院、保證任何建議牽涉英國而使之參加陸海軍之國際行動者、英政府於未經議會承認以前絶不予以接授、首相僅答稱、目下關於此事、正在進行談判政府按照習憒、不能不守緘默云、</p>

<p>據林君說：中暹係無約國，暹政府對於中國有政治色彩人物，向不招待；這番却不然，待以國竇，異常隆重；可見政變以後的暹政府，已改善其對華待遇。而且，現任各軍副司令，各部部長，都係華僑子孫，如蕭佛成委員的子婿，均充暹政府要職；參議院長某君述其家中尙藏有中土「光錄大夫」的銜牌，外交部長亦係中國文昌縣人。全暹人口一千萬，華僑佔五分之一；就中以潮州人爲最多，福州人次之。暹羅風俗習慣，彷彿第二的潮州，華暹人種，實在分别不出；因華僑在暹一納入口稅，便可充任官吏；現在暹羅各省的總督；都係潮州福州人充任云云。</p>
<p>唉！關東失陷以後，大家都有種「我瞻四方，蹙蹙靡所騁；」的感想；卻不料暹國以内·華僑還佔得這許多勢力；大家看了林君的談話，値得破涕爲笑的了。我特介紹於一般閱者，以便鼓勵我們民衆對外發展的精神。</p>
<h3>一二八戰役中之遺物</h3>
<p>— 鄒天馬</p>
<p>丨曁南大學陳列丨</p>
<p>去歲一二八事變，眞茹淪爲戰區，國立曁南大學初爲十九路軍軍部，又爲紅十字會前方醫院，迨十九路軍旣退，遂爲日軍所佔，該校慘遭蹂躪，校具標本搗毁一空，吾國高等敎育學府，竟淪爲敵國軍營，殊可歡也。</p>
<p>日軍撤後，幸該校主持人努力，數月間漸復舊觀，且該校從本學期起，自辦電燈廠與印刷所，又嚴格訓練學生，此未始非吾國敎育之一好現象也。</p>
<p>月之十一十二兩日，該校有菊花展覽會之舉，際此機會，并將日軍遺在該校之物品陳列，余嘗往觀焉，計有木屐，信紙，救護床。及零星什物甚夥，且有從空擲下之炸彈殼一枚，日本和尙衣一襲，其値吾人注意者，則爲日本小學生所繪之圖畫十餘幅，日本敎育，案注重訓練國民之愛國思想，自幼稚園以至大學，無不以此爲主旨，故自日軍侵佔我境後，彼國之小學敎師，即命兒童繪能激發兵士愛國心之漫畫，寄贈軍中，以作慰勞，曁南大學所陳列，乃係日本某小學學生所繪，寄贈十九聯隊者，或繪隨風飛揚之太陽旗·或繪　馬持槍之日兵，或繪中國兵士之被殺，林林總總，五光十色，要之其用意皆在藉此以激發軍人之愛國思想也。</p>
<h3>病態</h3>
<p>— 傳韻</p>
<p>丨對症下藥丨</p>
<p>身上暖烘烘的穿着駝絨新袍子，碰見人却會拚命的喊着：「多冷呀，可憐的東北義勇軍，在雪地裏，冰凉的拿着生硬的槍，打着，打着···」自己的手，又是揷在口袋裏，熊度是那樣的幽閑。說話，大槪是中國人唯一的拿手好戲！</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>坐在電車上，嘴裏是嚷着：「女人來，總得讓開位子的！」但是眼前膝頭上，是動蕩着，擁擠着那一些鷄皮鶴髮，瘦弱的，又討厭的，老的女人或男人。自己却泰然的坐着，心裏這樣想：「多討厭，老在這裏擠！」</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>多熱心，馬路上，報紙上，都可以看得見商店裏大拍賣，而且拍賣裏還是捐助義勇軍，於是「於多買一件，多救一條命」的招貼，便花花綠綠的貼在玻瑙櫃上面。多買一件，固然是可以多救一命，但一件之中加幾成之幾，却未必是會發生着那偌大的効力呢？</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>報紙上登載着捐助的啓事，轟動着只是一些發起的人：影戲院裏，三大公司的廣告，却轟動整千整萬的同胞們，買，拚命的買，錢是不在乎的！同一個報紙上，同登着大塊的廣告，然而，然而結果又是這樣！</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>女人們自己在喊着解放，别人也在替伊們宣傳着。表面上我們隨便走到一個機關裏·總可以看得見幾位女職員們·的確，這是一種解放的成績：但是，機關上的那種「花瓶」的風傳，却始終是在盛行着，女同志們，却那樣自滿着，承認着，「要不是解放，我何以會有職業呢？而且是這樣幽逸的職業呢？」</p>
<h3>讀書人之工業</h3>
<p>— ·陶·在·東</p>
<p>自天虚我生劍製無敵牌牙粉，爲國貨生色，以贖書人而爲工業，輿論稱之。一時瑜亮，厥有丁絨。丁續者，卽各報登載長沙華新羽絨公司專售之湖南特産丨製鴨被褥枕墊是也。絨之功用，不獨禦寒，兼爲浮水利器，其紛行銷全國，漸次出口，蔚爲一業。十餘年前，固根本無此物也。登明創造者，爲丁鵬　，字摶九，湖兩衡山縣人，祖父均翰林科甲，仕成返鄉，掌敎書院，以儒世其家。摶九以縣學生員，畢業師範大學，服務敎育界有聲。公暇研究鴨絨之製造，屢經失敗，虧耗不貲，親朋姗笑。摶九鍥而不捨，卒底於成，得政府之特許事利，由是丁絨之名詞，傳播人口。于言此者，以爲讀書本求爲有用之學，願我青年聰明才智，當用之於工商實業有用之途，一爲文人，便無足觀，必如陳栩圜丁摶九，方不愧爲讀書人耳。</p>
<h3>眞正隱逸之花</h3>
<p>— 石予</p>
<p>丨尙在人間丨</p>
<p>程瞻廬君把現在的菊花，呌它們做花中政客。假使五光十色的千百種名菊，都變了人，都生了嘴，也不能和老程去强辯的了。不過有一種菊花，它是不任受咎的；它依然是隱逸的高情逸致，保存着當年『鞠有黄華』的正色，就使東籬故主；再生今日：對之也沒有一些兒的愧怍。而且周茂叔見了它；也仍稱它爲花之隱逸。因爲盛大的菊花會上，它本來不願意厠身其間。菊花會上也用不着它。那些茶寮酒樓戲館；它當然終身沒有涉足，更不用說了。這種菊花究竟在什麽地方呢？只爲瞻廬兄常日在城圈子的書房裏，沒有到荒烟野蔓的窮鄉僻壤去走走，自然不會遇到眞正老牌的隱逸之花了。不過這種眞正老牌的隱逸之花，早經被人把它加上一個字，去譏評它，呌它做「野菊花。」彷彿現在慣出風頭的人，見了一個布衣樸　的老成之士，就不予他一個文明的文字，要把野蠻的一個野字去私諡他了。那知世人不放在眼裏的野菊花：它的花，它的葉，都可以配藥療病。原不比五光十色，變成政客性質的菊花，除了供給人玩弄外，就沒有别的用處。因此要把它特别提出來，講給人家聽聽。瞻廬兄旣把『花中政客』四字來譏笑菊花，一定對於眞正老牌的隱逸之花，沒有不愛敬的。瞻廬兄一定還要說我倒忘懷了；我倒忘懷了；是不是麽？</p>
<h3>短訊</h3>
<p>— 銘新</p>
<p>京滬滬杭函鐵路同人，此次爲援助東北義勇軍，特於月之十四十五兩日，假座三星舞台演劇籌欵，座劵計分二元一元五角三種，總數票面共發出五千餘張，因此兩日間觀者竟全告滿座。所演各劇，胥屬上乘，其中尤以向不輕易表演之諸名媛，而能慨然犧牲色相爲最難得。並悉該路同人，將繼往首都表演兩日，仍爲東北義軍請命云。</p>
<h3>死之岔道㈩㈥</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>伊不樂意；要想姓劃，恐怕給人尋根問底，知道了伊的來歷。可惜爺娘早去世了，沒有期功之親，纔做人家的意養媳，當時小得很，那裏記得姓。這可費斟酌了，經多回的考慮，揀百家姓上現代最華貴的姓，姓了一個蔣。</p>
<p>又是小報的投稿家着忙了，拍照片，印名片，做宣傳稿，認寄爺，一樣一樣，按步主班的做去，不久就紅起來了，幾乎把老資格的汲引者丨小珠丨都壓倒了。果然，不出小珠所料，衣食住都不用費心，願意供張的，應接不暇，正愁不能一一接受他們的美意盛情。的確，帶來的四隻小皮箱裏的衣服，一件也用不着了，天雨，時候遲早，沒有打扮，偶然披披，但是還怕給不速之客撞見了，惹他們笔話，當眞都送到典當裏去。小珠對伊說：</p>
<p>「你是做人家的，捨得把一雙絲襪丢掉了麽？恐怕還是前天晚上買的呢。」</p>
<p>愛麗說：「統上有一個小眼，不能穿了。」</p>
<p>小珠說：一我在蘇州，還見你用鈎子，抽破襪上的絲，補新襪的破空，難道到了上海，不滿三個月已忘記了。</p>
<p>愛盟抽一支香烟給小珠，自己也吸了一支，坐在沙發裏，仰起了頭，撮尖了嘴，吐出一圈一圈煙縷來，鼓着兩頤微笑，好久纔說：</p>
<p>一人是賤的，我想穿廿六塊一雙絲襪的，比我們更暴殄呢。」</p>
<p>愛姑戀愛麗，已到了十分火候了，什麽都變換一，只有額上距離左眉半寸光景地方，有一個瘢，雖給秀髮遮着，不經意的，要顯露出來的。這是不可磨滅的了。是在十歲那年，在翠微村上趕水，給阿根手裏的竹竿挑破的創痕。</p>

<h3>糧食米市陰化漲五六角</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日來源較前尤稀約抵念除號、市上銷場　　躍、陰化酒户採辦、行情猛跳六七尺、早晚稻及蘇同帮統提一二尺、洋杜尖頂緊次定、</p>
<p>新閘　蘇州河各帮來船三四十號、本街交易不見丨分活動、常錫北　略有囤户、開盤降漲二角薄稻飛來鳳寗胃稍有、跟起角許、變陰元貨少、價提三尺零全日斛開三四千石、</p>
<h3>洋客秈銷呆看疲</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况停頓無市、市面亦見疲軟因客秈來貨漸多、市上到存　有、棧存已達五千以上、途中亦有四五千包、不日抵埠因産地價落後、適値申市活潑之時、引起各帮販運、但搬運一多、價即步落、本客觀望之後、形勢立見不振福州與北帮雖尙有辦胃、但鑒於市面不佳、亦擯持不動守其跌後再辦、本街用神於河下米、因此全日未有成交、洋米存錢有六十萬包、雖大半數不能流動然有此大批存底外、再有國内新米豐收人心之虚、不言而喻、後市觀察似無樂觀也</p>
<h3>標粉平疲</h3>
<p>丨收前喊價略好丨</p>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、欠致量平疲之象、以洋麥報價、回小一二角左右、近遠期人心、均最軟弱、本月份現貨、北洋帮因對河關保、曾見迫切、惟一過封河、此　銷路、勢必遜色、遠期各月份、以買户不暢、亦見平疲較前日收盤、小五厘至一分二釐半不等、迨至下午開盤、初亦盤旋入後因廠抛有限、　阜兩廠、出數均屬無幾、各盤喊價略俏至現澳麥情形、聞又成交兩船、十二月二日裝船、價三兩五錢四分半、成傳四分七釐半、因匯率關係、喊價微昂頭澳麥逐步暢訂、此後升沉、全看銷場如何也、結果本月份不動、十二月份大二釐半、一月份小二釐半、二月份小七厘半、三四月份小五釐云、</p>
<h3>期麥俏俐之由來</h3>
<p>丨現籌不　　浮空抵補丨</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後各月份市面、形勢頗見俏利、因洋麥雖逐步暢定、且目下報價、並不昂貴依照現境、實雖活躍惟以市塲籌碼、實在不豐、故買氣稍旺卽易振動、上午各盤、以浮空抵補、近遠期似好一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、因傳廠家又有澳麥定成兩船、此種情形、雖尙無直接影響、惟將來洋麥之供給、當不成問題、因此人心微軟、結果一月份大二分、三月份小一分、餘無入云、</p>
<h3>芝加哥小麥多頭了結</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週二芝加哥小麥先因東方投機帮繼續買進而漲後因獲利了結回小結果比上日各期跌零八七五分、又十四日成交數共三千萬蒲歇兩茲將十五日行市列左、</p>

<h3>南北貨龍口粉銷路漸動</h3>
<p>龍口線粉干、近日銷路稍見活動、本街走胃較佳客貨開出百餘包、價十八兩六錢、查地價每砠爲二十五兩四五錢、疲勢平平、此間存底尙屬不多、統共　五百包之　烟臺粉亦少、昨市北規售盤上牌爲十九兩、次之十八兩八錢、南規售十八兩四五錢、烟臺粉十六兩、市價已至相當地步、如後市銷暢、當有漲望、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白復呈疲象</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以標金見跌、趨勢復疲、公會　盤二十四號粗砂白呌盤仍爲十四兩八錢五分、乃受手　　、竟無成交、十八號中砂白十四兩、二十號中砂白十四兩三錢、勢亦平疲八號新荷赤十一兩半、新九號十一兩七錢、陳貨次八號華新貨十一兩○五分、略有跌落、九十號陳貨十一兩五六錢、無更動國産青糖現在存底已缺、市價本可稍升、無如迴來走銷不暢、勢亦疲軟、提莊青開九兩五六錢、黄　青九兩四錢、隆江青九兩至九兩、錢、漳刁青茲聞建帮號家現有續到一批、如貨品干赤、價可稍升云、</p>
<h3>絲茶白廠經紐約來價仍小</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊絲市、仍乏進展可能緣紐約市塲絲綢巾雖見活動、而現絲廠進仍懈、更兼日絲旺到競銷仍力、絲價轉趨疲勢、白廠經紐約來價仍小、廠方以虧本難售云、</p>
<h3>無錫陳繭掃數運滬</h3>
<p>無錫絲繭商、因接江浙整理陳絲繭委員會一再通告後、除將手中所存陳絲繭照章登記外、茲以江浙絲業庫券發行在卽、各繭商存儲堆棧之陳乾繭、現均分批裝輪、運滬存儲、或委託絲廠代　、無錫陳繭二萬餘包、現已掃數運滬云、</p>
<h3>針秀眉交易暢旺</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、來路之針眉　　　綠茶、交易頗見暢旺、英莊天祥暢時等行、需要均般、市盤轉復堅硬、仍眉珠茶等花色、雖均有零星交易、但行家認價、依然緊縮、嫠源西北兩路貨、去路大爲呆滯、中低莊綠茶市面、已告穩定、高莊仍難認爲樂觀云、</p>
<h3>五金英白鐵實銷無幾</h3>
<p>昨五金市况、仍呈坪庸之局、各貨開出依然無鉅大數額、但以定價高翔、外匯挺秀、所以人心良佳、是以尙少回降者、惟久稱暢銷之英白鐵、近日實銷無多人氣、市勢均呈外强内弱之形勢、計三六尺每張估八錢二分三七尺九錢六分半、二十八號十二兩二錢、二十六號十一兩七錢半、二十四號十一兩五錢、二十二號十一兩二錢半、至於交易方面、三七尺聞有二三百扎、開出三六尺以及厚花色、各帮除有問津外、殊無採辦者、聞近來洋行現貨紛紛開出、所以標準前途、不免仍有影響也、至於上海所出本廠白鐵、近因成本昂貴、難於合算、所以市上開出、亦有杯水車薪之項、</p>
<h3>疋頭愈趨愈俏之眞馬鬃</h3>
<p>昨日公會市氣甚佳、各貨停價依然平穩、祇眞馬鬃袖裏趨勢愈趨愈俏、售價節節增漲、躉批每碼喊至一兩三錢半、市存不多、執貨者均居以爲奇按氣候突冷銷路驟廣、買方念需候用、因之不得不高抬價格、倘日後無新貨到來、其價尙須上漲矣、</p>
<h3>煤炭柳江煤價漲銷暢</h3>
<p>柳江白煤、日來銷路頗好、每日交易輒有三四百噸之多、昨日做開又有四百十餘噸、每噸、每噸售價漲起五錢計現售每噸爲十四兩云、</p>

<p>丨三十三比二十三丨</p>
<p>兩江大勝初級　崇德敗於綠隊</p>
<p>本屆西青女籃球會、昨晚開幕、以江南體師之棄權於西青籃隊、故僅四組中以東南與西青紅隊之戰最爲劇烈、兩隊實力平均、結果東南以三十三比二十三獲勝、第一塲兩江甲隊以四十六比六分勝初級兩江之表演亦美妙可觀、東南兩江皆富有得標希望、崇德之敗於綠隊、以身材過小、則不勝爲之可惜、</p>
<p>㈠兩江甲勝初級···四十六比六開幕賽兩江對初級、相形之下、形勢懸殊、兩江隊威風猶存、聯絡殊佳、投籃亦有標的且全隊平均攻守均佳、分數繼長增高扶搖直上對手初級實爲無能之輩、進不能攻、退不能守、第一節兩江得十一分初級未兩紀錄往後形勢相同初級仍無起色當兩江得二十六分時初級始開紀錄　得寳貴之兩分上半時乃成二十六比二第三節起初級增四分、兩江又加十六分成四十二比六總結果兩江以四十六比六勝觀兩江實力殊　　動、仍有保持冠軍之希望</p>

<p>㈡美婦勝兩江乙···三四比十四美國女子對兩江乙隊、競爭頗見劇烈、但少精彩美女子中鋒晏麗夫人與蒲沙許女士聯絡頗佳且動作迅速、投籃準確兩江乙以朱荷凰較爲出色但全隊球藝、尙覺欠缺、第一節爲八比三上半時爲十七比十、第三節爲三十比十二結果則爲三四比十四、美婦勝第四節起美隊因二人退塲乏人替補、僅以五人作戰、</p>

<p>㈢東南勝紅隊····三三比二三東南對西南紅隊之一塲、爲昨晚最緊張最重要者、以兩隊在爭標中、皆具相堂位、而實力相去無多也、結果東南稍佔優勢、以三十三比二十三分獲勝、在東南不黄去一大敵也、</p>
<p>東南隊一路居先　紅隊雖先罰中一分開紀錄、東南回首卽連中二球於是分數之差、東南始終以五分至八分超出而居先紅隊一步不鬆、在後追隨、因此殊現緊張之勢、最接近時、上半時終了、東南以十八比十三僅勝五分、東南最盛、則爲二十八比十五勝十三分、</p>
<p>傑漢生紅隊大柱　紅隊昨晚獲分畿全爲傑漢生一人之力、二十三分中、射中十八分一成風不减、紅隊動作之速、勝於東南、機會亦不少、徒以一前鋒除傑漢生外、具餘二人、無以射籃、杏則東南遭其牽手矣</p>

<h3>本市復興公債歸英商承銷</h3>
<p>蔡局長發表談話</p>
<p>上海復興公債條例聞經立法院修正通過、承銷合同、亦已簽訂、各報記者昨向財政局探詢承銷情形、承蔡局長發表談話如次、</p>
<p>㈠該項公債六百萬元、由上海英商利安洋行承銷、並委託匯豐銀行經理還本付息事宜、市政府將按票面八折實收、計洋四百八十萬元、㈡利安洋行照承銷金額繳欵後、如何推銷市政府不予過問、大約該行將按標面八五折售出、緣該行須担負一切推銷費用、如廣告等費、（本市前次發行公債、亦用費數萬元、）及經記人佣金等、故不能不將債價提高數厘、（按市面習慣、經記人佣金、約需二厘至四厘之譜、前上海電話公司發行公債二千萬兩、經紀人佣重、小者二厘、大者四厘、）將來本市對外信用日著、該項公債售價、能繼續提高、超過八五折以上、亦意中事耳、㈢上海匯豐銀行、最近十餘年、頗鮮經理中國債劵、此次本市債劵、由利安洋行承銷、並由匯豐銀行經理還本付息事宜、足見該行深知經濟上之共同利害、故能相與合作、以後本市建設事業、方興未艾、有賴於中外銀團贊助者至多、此不過一端而已、㈣我國内債由外商承銷者、前未多見本市、舉、將使外人興奮投資觀念、各種國内債劵、將同受良好之影響、㈤該公債定期二十年、完全清償年、</p>
<p>息七厘、利安洋行按票面八折承銷照數繳欵、並無任何佣金、自承銷日起、至清償日正、平均計算約得年息分零六毫六絲八忽、換言之、則市政府此次利用債欵、平均年息、亦爲一分零六毫六絲八忽、但利安洋行如按八五折售出、則投資者所得平均年息、爲九厘五毫八絲九忽、查各種國同債劵、雖有按十足或九八折發行、但市上開盤價格最高不過七八折左右、降至近日、僅及四五折之譜、按市價折合利率、已多在月息一分以上、故本市此次發行公債、其利率不能過低、惟以上述平均年息計算、已較各種債劵低减不少矣、㈥本市此次發行公債、以市民當戰等凋敝之餘、缺乏認購能力、故不向市民勸募、此節業於前次談話時詳細叙及、至本國銀行界方面、亦曾據由中央通訊社發表談話、謂戰後金融奇緊確無餘力承銷此項公債等語、緣此、乃商由外商承銷、實際上則爲間按利用外資、查利用外資辦理市政、在我國雖未多見、在他國則不乏先例、日本在歐戰前救濟金融、及地震後復興東京、迭次發行債劵、多向歐美銷售、至於舉辦國營事業、　多利用外資如美國在歐戰前、展築鐵道、則取資於英、日本投資南滿、獲得特殊權利　　多由英美挹注、數目前、台灣因發展電氣事業、借欵數千萬元、亦由紐約銅團摩根公司投資、此不過略舉數　而已、</p>

<p>史量才談　常務理事史最才語中央社記者云、收買招商局股票及三棧押欵二事、本局茲經收歸國營、關係政府之事、將由父　部主辦、故理事會未有討論、至於局方向中國　業公司收回三棧碼頭、公司方面、曾提昌抗議、而滬上各西文報、因未悉眞相多方責難本局、且以爲監視李國杰、而不提交法院究　、似不合法治、實到李國杰保暫被監視、一俟政府决定辦法後、或交法院審訊、或由政府處分、始能定奪、一方面接收三碼頭、　爲恐全體工人之發生意外　、蓋招商局前曾舉借匯豐銀行之五百萬兩、及鹽年欠息代墊捐稅等二百餘萬兩、其約七百餘萬兩、急須清償、故該項碼頭、已有第一債　人之匯豐銀行在、若加此一千萬兩中國營業公司之押欵、則招商局已全部破産、依此爲生之多數苦力工伇、必將全部失業、而我國之航、亦必全部斷送、故此種斷然之處置、亦有其不得已之苦衷在也云、</p>
<p>劉鴻生談　據總經理劉鴻生面告新聲社記者云、昨日報載、謂本人有四棧經理處非法被押云云實　誤會、本人只認此項抵押手續、如屬合法、則招商局當然承認、所謂合法者、就商業上言、則應由股東會通過、就政治上言、則如此大事、應由行政院通過、四棧抵押、是否經此手續、値得研究耳、</p>
<p>接收未了　董事會雖經理事會接收後、但各項文件、均未辦理結束、須俟晤李國杰、再行詳細點　、産業科、因與積餘地産公司關係甚大、尙未接收完竣、至於監事會、已在前監督處舊址開始辦公、理事會已在前董事會舊址開始辦公云、</p>
<p>美商抗議　昨日該局續接美商中國營業公司抗議函、繼續聲明、其並非放棄合同上得之權利、及催促派員負責、接洽種種手續、或了結本案、聞此案昨日理事會、業經討論、結果呈請交部、候示應付辦法云、</p>

<h3>小開綁親生子</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨見報載，鎭江晋源錢莊小開黄政卿，因賭博輸去萬餘金，無法可想，乃將年甫二齡幼子，命乳娘藏匿，揑告其父，爲匪綁去，卒因手續未周，事情敗露，</p>
<p>綁票案件，近來頗爲風行，甚至有綁朋友者，有綁親戚者，有綁東家者，而綁親生的兒子，尙是破題兒第一次聽見，黄政卿因爲賭博，輸去鉅欵，計無所出，乃綁親生兒子的票，向父詐錢，這事直接綁兒子的票，其實間接是綁父親的票，旣犯賭博又同盜匪，兩罪俱發，惡極萬分，宜黄老老鬍鬚翹起矣。</p>
<p>近來人心大變，大變人心，兒子可綁父親，父親可綁兒子，即綁票案中，已是花樣翻新，奇妙百出，其實綁票原不過是個抽象的名詞，凡用種種非法手段，而强逼他人的錢財，或用强權使人無理屈服，無法反抗的，無一而非綁票性質的行爲，惟綁票匪之綁票，尙有事實可以證明，法律可以懲辦，而非綁票匪之綁票，則誠無法裁制矣，我只有誦幾位老前輩之言曰，</p>

<h3>題臨夏調查業葬餓殍照片五古一首</h3>

<p>臨夏調查業葬餓殍照片五古一首甚</p>
<p>爲悲慘轉錄如下以告閱者</p>
<p>吾鄉苦兵燹，庶民半離散，屢撫屢叛離，饑寒未易免，溝壑留餘生，苟且延殘喘，太息八口家，大都雙足跣，但得裏糧多，何必菽麥辨，但得好雨來，何愁天氣暵，深受大府恩，翻嫌姚潭淺，我來振流亡，心長材力短，冷炙與殘羹，人難徧一盌，巡視菜色民，饑腸轆轤轉，尩羸面黄焦，死亡肢體斷，蠅蛃嘬血膏，狗彘銜髮辮，新鬼哭且言，甲兵何日洗，故鬼咈且吁，經綸何人展，欲將生命全，苦把唇鬚撚，嗟嗟亂離人，纍纍喪家犬，白膏堆如山，京觀封土墠，感此作悲歌，</p>

<h3>舊棉花爲新棉法</h3>
<p>— 一薇</p>
<p>棉絮翻在衣服中或在被褥内，用過一二年，棉質未改，略爲加工，就可化爲新棉，不獨柔而輕暖，且其伸縮力對於染色極爲相宜。</p>
<p>（一）將舊棉絮撕得粉碎，用彈車彈開，人力亦可，噴以清水。</p>
<p>（二）鍋中先用適量之清水煑佛，將苛性鈉投入，溶化後，取噴水舊棉，投入水鍋内，煑三小時而後撈起，（開鍋氣冲時面目切勿近）放榨床，榨去黑水，置竹籮内，用清水洗凈，榨乾。</p>
<p>（三）用甲乙二木桶，中桶底邊鑿漏孔一，孔之内邊，釘細鉛絲綱一層，用木塞塞之，將漂白粉傾入甲桶，用清水少許化開，添水攪匀，以蓋蓋置四小時，切勿洩氣，將乙桶接住甲桶漏孔，拔去甲桶木塞，使澄清漂粉水漏入乙桶，再傾入缸裏，加清水攪拌（夏水冷水冬用熱水）以洗過之棉，放入漂粉水内攪匀，以蓋蓋緊，（不可走氣以免漂白無力），浸十二小時，取出洗凈榨乾。</p>
<p>（四）用硫酸放入清水缸内，化成淡硫酸水，用漂棉放入，露置二小時，取出洗淨榨乾。</p>
<p>（五）用食鹽明礬一種，投入清水缸内，將洗凈榨乾之棉投入，淹一小時取出，以清水洗凈榨乾，曬燥，用彈花車彈開，或人力彈亦可，即成上白棉花較新棉尤勝。</p>
<p>製法：</p>
<p>舊棉花三十斤　食鹽研未五兩</p>
<p>漂白粉（BleacbngPowder）三斤四兩</p>
<p>苛性鈉（CaustjcSodo）四斤半</p>
<p>明礬（Alums）六兩</p>
<p>硫酸(SulluricAcid)一斤一兩</p>

<h3>神秘的情書</h3>
<p>— 阿羊</p>
<p>X女校裏的書信，須由每一級組織一審查會審查後，才發給各人。以是一般有情書往來的，大受其障碍，有些聰明的，大施其聯絡手叚，運動啦，請客啦，事情就得安然過去。有些呢，不免藉以要挾，或者竟不客氣地宣佈出來，笑話也就常常發生。</p>
<p>K女士誰都知道她有位情人的，但是絶沒有發現過一通情書，雖則每星期也有紅綠信封寫着她名字的信，他内容僅是幾句短句，或一首似詩非詩一類的文字，個中情形，局外人又都猜測不透的，眞的，字裏行間，常是發現一些不相干的描寫，這個，確是使審查的人們表示驚疑。以是不但對K女士生了神秘的懷疑，並且進一步誓要打破這個奇案</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，不得不使審查會裏人員努力對此疑案了。</p>
<p>又是一個日期大了。在一堆發人幽思的　件　　又發現了　　　　女士的信，精神自然貫注於此了，但是審查結果，依然是和前二次信的情形仿佛，僅是一首詩一類的文字，字句又是首尾不甚聯貫的。原函是這樣的；</p>
<p>明月皎潔地懸掛天空，</p>
<p>天是多麽的清朗幽靜！</p>
<p>三五點星兒閃閃搖動，</p>
<p>時光早已是萬籟俱靜！</p>
<p>法啞鈴奏起相思的曲，</p>
<p>國運偏又如此的多厄！</p>
<p>花好月圓已非時！</p>
<p>園林寂寞悲凋秋！</p>
<p>等候娜，天使來臨，</p>
<p>你記否？佳景良晨。</p>
<p>俗語說得好；「三個臭皮匠及個諸葛亮。」在全體審查員的全神貫注中，竟發現了個中秘密，原來這是一封神秘的約會情書，句子都是免强凑成，只重要着每句頭一個字，就是「明天三時法國花園等你」事情大白了，誰都感到事情的新奇，同時又佩服Ｋ女士情人的能發奇想。刹時間早已播傳全校，Ｋ女士也已紅了臉被同學的笑語中包圍了。</p>

<h3>新法敲詐</h3>
<p>— 粒火</p>
<p>好久不見的張君，昨天突然地降臨到舍間，使我出乎意外的歡欣，我連忙招呼他至屋裏叙談闊别的狀况，一番寒喧之後，在他的談話中，方知張君近在虹口開了一爿商店，生意還算不差，並述他新近受敲詐的事情，特錄出以供同好，</p>
<p>昨天下午，我（張君自稱）從親戚的家裏出來，擬搭六路電車回店，正徘徊在停車處的當兒，忽然地眼廉裏現出一個小夥子，他開口就道：</p>
<p>「張兄近來好啊？現在何處發財，兄弟近來境况異常拮据，不瞞老兄說，窮得連一日三餐也無着落，聞得老兄近來很是發達，府上新近租在海寗路，兄弟本當趨前拜訪，奈因衣衫褸襤，自慚形穢，今日天巧相逢，實屬萬幸，老兄去年在鄉時向弟面借之十元，迄今未承歸還，想係貴人多事，早已忌記了，兄弟對於這區區之數，本不應這樣的冒昧催討，奈因飄泊海上，開銷無着，又無親戚可靠，故不得已厚顔懇求，想吾兄當不爲弟怪」！</p>
<p>我被他說得天花亂墜，頭昏腦漲，至終還是一個莫明其妙，更沒有這樣一個人相識過，因同他力辯誤會，豈知他一口咬定說我自小還同過學，並且和他是親戚，他姓王，他姊夫的姑母同我母親是同胞姊妹，在去年的五月裏，曾托他在上海買過十元衣料，以前時常往來，近來想係我窮了，連朋友也不認識了，諸位先生們，你們看那有這樣道理！那許多的閑人，多覺得他理由充足，並且還得出履歷，都向我譏訕着，不應這樣的對待朋友，</p>
<p>我當時被他監着衆人，無緣無故的一頓訕駡，仗他的口舌鋒利，竟說得我面紅耳赤，哑口無言，毫無辯論的餘地，後來總算旁人出來做和事老，呌我給他一元以作罷論，我那時勢成騎虎，弄得進退兩難，祇得自認誨氣，給了一元終算解圍，後經我一打聽，果有此輩無賴，專在電車站及交通之處，向客敲詐，並且被詐的竟無可理論，他們是專在打聽各人履歷，一經被他探出，便可進行他的賣買，手婉好的，一次能騙到百餘元不等，但他們也看人頭起，倘是一般老上海的，决不會光顧的，奉勸一般忠厚的同志們，勿上他的圈套，</p>

<p>淞滬之役，十九路軍誓死抗日，屢挫敵鋒，舉世驚服，嗼爲神勇，眞是高山上敲鑼，（四方聞名）！「名爲鳴之諧音」</p>

<p>國難方殷，一般武人政客，還要攘利爭權，作威作福，眞是買了乾魚放生（弗得知死活）！</p>

<p>他答道；鄉下人的衣，食，住，十九都採用國貨啊！而都會裏的衣，食，住，十九都是舶來品呢！</p>

<h3>人道</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>人道主義者坐在黄包車上，當他經過外灘的時候，他看見許多苦力蓬頭垢面的在痛苦的使盡全力的搬運貨物，吭唷吭唷，十分悲痛，於是他不禁心慟；</p>
<p>「啊！這簡直是人間地獄·直是大不人道了。可是他們苦力爲什麽要這樣幹呢？難道他們不會去找旁的職業嗎？旣是人類爲什麽要過着牛馬般的生活呢？哎！他們眞是一羣笨猪啊！」於是滿腔尊貴的同情不免轉對他們加以鄙視了。但是他又想：「但是他們畢竟是十分可憐的啊，他們食不飽，衣不暖，誰也應當同情他們的。對了，我應當可憐他們，我可以給他們一些銅板，他們一定會十分感激的。而且這是我積陰德的頂好的機會，這樣做，對於我的道德當然是無形中提高了許多。一</p>
<p>於是只見他高懷惻隱，嫩肥的白手在懷中掏出一握銅板，嘩啦啦的從黄包車上鄭將下去。當然，這一羣饑餓的人們會瘋狂的搶着上來拾取銅元，拾得了的還要拾，沒有拾得的更要拾，每一個銅元都有如自己的生命，爭着，搶着，結果他從他手裏搶去，他又從他手裏奪回，於是咒罵，毆打，滾在地上，扭在汽車的輪盤旁邊，更有人從他們身上踏着過去，一會兒焦頭爛額，皮破血流。這時的人道主義者覺得非常榮幸，「哦做了好事了；」不由的從黄包車上跳下，挺着胸膛，走上前去，提高嗓子喊：　　「你們别打呀，爲什麽要打呢？我再給你們幾個好啦。」</p>
<p>又是一陣嘩啦啦，又是一羣人從四面八方奔來，又是搶，又是奪，眞的，他們爲着生存，爲着飢餓，爲什麽不應當如此呢？</p>
<p>當然，我們的人道主義者覺得更加「積德」了，自心坎裏湧上一般快樂，接上是哈哈大笑。但是他立刻遇着兩箭憤怒的眼光掃射在他的臉上，接上是一個大漢指着他怒吼着：</p>
<p>「你好笑嗎？你看着我們打架好笑嗎？你拿幾個銅板來敎我們打架給你看嗎？混蛋！」</p>
<p>咦！我好意救濟你們，難道還得罪了你們嗎？眞是一羣不識恩仇的野獸！」他恨恨的說。</p>
<p>「噢？你是救濟我們？」另一人說：「謝謝你的好意，可是你爲什麽看着我們爲了你幾個銅板打得皮破血流反到大笑起來？這不是有意和我們開玩笑嗎？」</p>
<p>羣衆中喊着濃重的嚷打的聲音，使得他感覺畏懼，於是立刻縮着身子逃出，飛快的跳上原來的黄包車，口裏吆喝着車夫「快！快！快走！」</p>
<p>在前面他是遇着一個武裝巡捕，於是急忙敎巡捕趕快去彈壓，理由是一羣「牛馬」在嚷着打他。</p>
<p>只見巡捕也像煞有介事連忙跑去。</p>
<p>一直走到自家門口，他才輕鬆的吐了一口氣。眼見黄包車夫滿頭是汗。</p>
<p>一會兒車夫接了錢喘着氣請求多加幾個銅板，可是他並不允許，他說：</p>
<p>「我不是和你講好了兩毛錢的嗎？又吵什麽？」</p>
<p>「不，先生！跑得太快，累不過，而且在外灘的時候，我又等了你許久。」</p>
<p>「請管這些丨多一個板也沒有。」</p>
<p>「可是請先生做做好事罷，我們太可憐了！」</p>
<p>但是這一位人道主義者終於悻悻的嘭的一聲將大門關上了。</p>

<h3>好萊塢的新生活　明星大閙孩子潮</h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>以前好萊塢的明星，誰都知道她們的生活，都在衣食住和玩的方面，互相競爭眩耀。但是從來沒有像現在對於孩子問題的那樣熱閙。從前，她們相互間的戰具是燦爛的服裝，華貴的汽車，奢侈的宴會，富麗的大厦甚至於玩的方面，一個闢了一所九個的高爾夫球塲，别的就爭造着十八個洞的球塲，當威廉海士在飯廳裏，舗了佈滿着各種花樣的地毬以後，但露拉彭海也就將他的飯廳舖了滿編着Beruvian蘭花式的地毯。腦瑪希拉在他的大姆指上，畫着奇巧的花色，瓊克勞馥也照樣描了一個他們對於孩子的觀念，向來是不大着重的，可是到了現在，好萊塢的空氣轉變了。她們所持以眩耀的唯一利器，是小孩了。</p>
<p>近來女星們的生活，都感到像在風浪裏的帆船，顚簸不安。有了小孩，就好像船有了錨，抛在江裏，就可鎭定。小孩是她們謀幸福的武器，命運的庇祐者。所以有名的女星，都希望在這個世界上，兼做一個有名的母親。她們更覺得一個小孩還不算完美，倘然沒有的話，那沒這一對夫婦，簡直是可憐蟲。</p>
<p>據希佛萊的朋友說，他想和他的夫人離婚，因爲他渴望着兒子的緣故。</p>
<p>約翰密而强的妻子，有前夫所生的兒子二個，約翰很愛他們。幾個月前，他自己也生了一個，近來他把這三個孩子，同時到法庭上去備案，要求承認用他的姓。現在已達到目的了，他覺得很得意意。</p>
<p>海倫海士的第二個孩子曼麗，是好萊塢有名的「聖孩」TbeActofGodＢaby當這個孩子産生之前，她正在拍Ｃoquetleo因爲她的生産，所以該片也忽然停拍。演員都鬧着向公司裏索薪金，經理沒法，只得到法庭裏懇勸解。他說女星的生産，是上帝的神聖行爲，人力所不能助的事情，（AnActofGcd），當時好萊塢的報紙上，就排着頭號字的標題TbeActofGodBabyo她覺得很奇怪，因爲她主演影片的名氣，倒沒有像生産這孩子的名氣來得大，</p>
<p>伊利諾鮑特門雖已生了二個女孩，還不能討着金維多的歡喜，所以他又娶了弗勞倫絲維多，弗勞倫絲已給他生二個女孩，最近又生了一個男孩，因此金維多就打算和伊利諾離婚了。</p>
<p>一游泳到好萊塢</p>
<p>亞林匹克運動大會游泳明星，伊琳諾霍姆，EleanorHolm不等到亞林匹克閉幕，就已被影片公司徵聘了去。她本來係㨗格飛歌舞團的演員。現在雖然加上了百米游泳錦標的冠冕，但是電影係歌舞的一種極好的歸宿，所以霍姆的歸向於電影，是很自然毫不勉强的。那幸運的電影片公司，就是華納兄弟公司。</p>
<p>他山之石</p>
<h3>獻給電影明星們</h3>
<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>有一些人說：現在中國的明星太多了。又有的說不夠，這兩種論調，各有見地的不同。關於說太多的，我們如果仔細的觀察一下，情形確是如此，祗要看近來幾家大公司裏的明星，好像是雨後春笋一樣的旺盛；假使說到他們所演的片子，給予觀衆的興奮意識呢，那又覺得後者所感到的很眞確。太多丨或是不夠，我們都可不必斷定。但是要知道一個電影明星的成功，並不是偶然的。必須要具幾個必要的條件：藝術技能上的修養，新社會多形態的意識，實地生活的體騐，這些都是一個明星成功的不可少的要素。所以我們期望着導演先生們，對於未來的演員，丨丨或現在的明星，在一部片子開拍的時候，須要使他們體會到劇中人的身份；不必矯枉過正，求合機械式的動作。這樣才能發揮他們的意識，到一種較好的表現。</p>
<p>在現在銀幕上所得到的印像，確不能使人滿意：往往一張片子上，有一兩個演員表演得還不算壞，但是要遇到了一個不合身份的演員，硬擠進去充數，那末這張片子，就算全功盡棄。</p>
<p>試舉一兩個例來說：中略：因爲作者所舉出的證例，或者是的確的，但在這幾位初上鏡頭的女主角們，或者她們不能體會到「良藥苦口」的好意，當作有意挑眼，非難，攻擊，反而失了作者鼓勵的眞意，並且從此失意，不自信，這都是要顧慮的。所以索興把他剪去了。（編者註）</p>
<p>身體的健康，也是個明星成功的要素。我們在銀幕上所見到那些外國演員；無論男女，沒有不是身强體壯，修短適中的帶着一種健美的體骼。要知道現在銀幕上所需要的是能夠刺激影響到大多數觀衆的健康美觀念。以前的什麽「溫文爾雅」；弱不經風；這此不僅不能倣效，並且要設法剷除。我企望負有藝術使命的明星們丨要立在時代車輪牽動地位，切不要「固步自封」的讓時代來拉自己。</p>

<p>導演小史</p>
<h3>史泰恩漢姆的一生（上）</h3>
<p>讀者且慢驚異這位導演名字的生澀，容我先來叙述他成功的經過。</p>
<p>史氏（EinstJosefVonSternbeim）現年三十九歲，他的體重二百八十磅，體積二立方米，身長二米三○，每天要吃一千克蘭姆的肉類，和攝取四加侖的液體，熱量是平温三十七度一分，變化爲七百五十克蘭姆的排洩物，他的呼吸是每天二萬一千，脈搏六萬，晨起必入浴，梳其頭髮並陰毛，他又信仰羅馬舊敎，俸給額每週四千五百元。</p>
<p>在三十九年之前，德意志南部的一個大學區内，有位年青的猶太種的洗濯女，被一個男性所侮弄而懷孕起來，那就是史導演的母親了，這男人是個近衛的士官，有着貴族階級的頭銜，史氏就繼承了這封建的勢力，而獲得許多特殊權利底保證，但他的母親，却說是受胎於上帝的聖靈，從而舉行了一個莊嚴的儀式，同時授予這個小天使以三位一體的金冠，當然，像這樣的事件，在那大學區裏的無神論者聽來，認爲是十分奇蹟的。</p>
<p>當史氏十六歲時，就决定了彼終身的兩大職業，雖然在東方人看來，或許不以爲怎樣的偉大，却是也很有趣呀，原來史氏的母親，爲欲使其兒子從洗濯籠和石鹼底泡沬中解放出來的緣故，便計劃了怎樣爲他選擇一種較高尙底職業，其時，適有一位退職了的少將設着一所私立的理髮大學，史氏便投考進去，穿起了大學生的服裝，當然，這是不消多說，在史母看來，兒子從此可以變成藝術家了，雖則這只不過是持着櫛和鋏的藝術家，却是可以借此交際些紳士們，闊政官，或是學界底聞人，比起洗濯業，自然要高貴得多了，史氏因了母親的啓示，對於這樣一種藝術衝動的職業，也表示相當的高興，竟以爲理髮師在藝壇上的地位，是是和詩人一樣的尊嚴呢。（未完）</p>
<h3>一九三二的中國電影界新女星風起雲湧</h3>
<p>— 吉仲</p>
<p>國産電影界，一響守舊而不前進的。自從陳燕燕主演「南國之」一片，而獲得一致的讚許後，各公司都感覺到提拔人材的重要。於是經聯華培植成大器者，有主演「野玫瑰」的王人美，主演「失足恨」的談瑛，主演「人道」的黎灼灼，主演「火山情血」的黎琍琍，主演「鐵骨蘭心」的馮潔貞，主演「粉紅色的夢」的薛玲仙，主演「故宫新怨」的陸雪英；天一公司也有主演「小女伶　」的袁美雲，</p>
<h3>啼笑因緣之一幕　星</h3>
<p>張恨水的啼笑因緣一書，拋說不過如此，（遠不逮春明外史）；而明星公司的電影啼笑因緣片子也並不怎樣驚人，（反不如舊時京華）。但是所以轟動的，當然是二者互相烘托宣傳的力量。明星公司犧牲了巨額的金錢，七十人同赴故都，也都是富有吸引力的大廣告。</p>
<p>好了！六萬尺大片，一套一套的，封神榜西遊記似的已出演了三分之二；其餘五六兩集，也已定期公映了。下圖便是第六集中樊家樹（鄭小秋）和何麗娜（胡蝶）在北平中山公園「公理戰勝」牌樓下情話喁喁的一幕。</p>
<p>主演「女性的呐喊」的王瑩；明星公司也有主演「舊恨新悉」的艾霞，主演「國魂的復活」的胡萍，主演「情侶」的龔秋霞，主演「可愛的仇敵」的朱秋痕。所以一九三二年的中國電影界，是新女星風起雲湧的一個時期。</p>
<p>昔日雄風而今安在</p>
<p>五六年前，威赫一時的幾個老牌影星如張織雲，楊耐梅，宣景琳等，目下都已成爲過去的人物。宣景琳自從脫離天一之後，徬徨歧途，總無問鼎之人，雖一度盛傳，加入羅根氏之聯合公司，但至今依然南華一夢，事實未成。張織雲與所天唐季珊仳離之後，遂爲明星公司所羅致，主演聲片「失戀」。片中情節，俱爲影射自己的身。我人以爲幕中人演劇中人，身份不謀而合，表演定當不恶；豈知日前試映，目擊者都謂女士於藝術一層，大爲退步。不獨動作呆滯，抑且近於做作。明星當局亦不以女士之作風爲然，此後或不將繼續合同。至於楊耐梅女士自脫離天一後，除爲大東金獅主演「春風楊柳」亦始終無一爿公司，加以聘請。耐梅自與粤人陳遜民結婚後，對於銀幕興趣，益爲淡薄。近日已結束上海法租界蒲柏路的公館。夫婦倆人，不日即將離滬赴港。銀幕豔影，或將從此絶賭了。</p>

<h3>像良將愛護好馬一樣</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>你今天對鏡子一照的時候，你就覺得與往日的照鏡子的時候大不相同。你看見鏡子裏的你，也與往日不很相同。你覺得今在的鏡子，有說不出來的樂趣在裏面。對不對？</p>
<p>對了。你與鏡子裏有了感情，自然覺得你自己的影兒不比以前了。你請鏡子老實告訴你。你的額骨是高是低。你要他老實告訴你，你的兩條眉毛是不是相並的，是不是一般粗細的。如果左眉翻過來做了你的右眉，右眉翻過來做了你的左眉，你的臉能不能變相。你的朋友你不會學得不是你了？再看，你的左右兩眼是不是一樣大小？左眼皮與右眼皮是不是一般高低？上下眼皮中間有沒有一條很深的線紋？（就是單眼皮與雙睛皮）如果有　兩邊是不是恰恰一樣的？有沒有高低？</p>
<p>這樣的查考一番之後，最好把關係你自己兩眼的詳細情形，記在一本簿子上。這是値得記錄的。人的脾氣往往把尙未得到的東西看得很重，把已經佔有的東西看得很輕。兩隻眼睛每天眞不知道要帮助我們辦成多少事。我們因爲亨福亨慣了，從來沒有發覺過眼睛的勞續。你如果已然决心决意把自己練成一個明星，你應當從今日起愛護你的眼睛，像古的時的良將愛護好馬一樣。</p>
<p>不對。你且先設身處地的想一想自己是一個瞎子。很可憐的瞎子！你想丨想你要看甚麽，甚麽皆看不見了。你發怒的時候，要用眼睛來發洩你的怒氣，但是你的眼睛是睜不開的。你想丨想你要當明星，影片公司不肯收用眞的瞎子。你這一輩子休想再成甚麽明星了。這是多麽可憐的事呀！</p>

<h3>Another Appeal to the Japanese People</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Recently, the early November issue of the Japanese Diplomatic Times published an article by Tamaki Hanzawa titled "Another Appeal to the Chinese People." When Hanzawa's "Appeal to the Chinese People" was first published, Mr. Erhe Tang and Mr. Zhong Tang of Diplomatic Review both wrote replies to Hanzawa. The Japanese Diplomatic Times was originally run by individuals involved in diplomacy, but it has now changed its former stance, recklessly promoting its militarism. Hanzawa's two appeals to the Chinese people are based on stimulating his own countrymen and defending militarism. We feel extreme displeasure reading them. However, Japan has progressed from a hypothetical enemy to a direct foe of our country. Therefore, we cannot ignore these peculiar arguments. Hence, in addition to translating Hanzawa's original text, we are writing "An Appeal to the Japanese People."</p>
<p>(1) Japan Has Gone Astray</p>
<p>The fact that Japan is a militarist state is universally known. Since the September 18th Incident, this relic of the 18th century has developed exceptionally. Furthermore, Japanese military cliques fabricate facts to incite the Japanese people, creating so-called emotionally charged slogans like "united in shared hatred." This has led the Japanese people to behave like those with a burning fever, disregarding the truth or falsehood of facts and whether matters are appropriate. They only consider benefits and ignore everything else, leading the whole country into a frenzy and engaging in the invasion of our Northeast. The sole pretext for this invasion, besides the Wanpaoshan Incident and the Nakamura Incident, is the so-called "Manchurian-Mongolian lifeline" and "national defense line" issues, used to confuse their own people, deceive the world, and invade China. This is done under the guise of maintaining peace in the Far East, but in reality, it is destroying peace. It is done under the guise of opening a front against Russia in the East, preventing communism, but in reality, it is monopolizing the three northeastern provinces and realizing their continental (invasion) policy. However, this kind of fanatical mentality is already beyond reason. What we want to tell are not those obsessed with militarism, but enlightened people with relatively clear minds who are not blinded by temporary emotions. Therefore, we do not need to refute Hanzawa's "Another Appeal to the Chinese People" point by point. However, we cannot help but make serious accusations against Hanzawa's "fallacies" to show the world that there is still "true right and wrong."</p>
<p>(2) Hanzawa's Fallacies</p>
<p>Hanzawa repeatedly "appeals to the Chinese people," focusing on approximately two points: First, he advocates direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, getting rid of the constraints of the League of Nations; second, he hopes that China will have a permanent and consolidated government. At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, we consistently opposed begging for help from the League of Nations, but we will never concede the demand for the extension of public reason and justice. Therefore, the true public opinion of our country has never relied on the League of Nations from the beginning. Although the majority of the people groan under the iron heel of imperialism, they have sworn from the beginning to seek self-regeneration through their own efforts. As for direct negotiations with Japan, ancient people were ashamed of a treaty signed under duress, and the current reality is that we Chinese people cannot abandon our national interests and willingly allow others to trample upon us. The government of China is China's internal affair, and no foreigner is allowed to interfere. Hanzawa's words are indeed extremely absurd.</p>
<p>Japanese public opinion generally defends recognizing the "Manchukuo" (puppet) state. In fact, the "Manchukuo" is a puppet created by Japanese soldiers, which is well known not only to the Chinese people in an adversarial position but also deeply understood by the League of Nations investigation team with deep insight. The so-called "Manchukuo" is entirely created by Japanese soldiers and officials. If there were no Japanese troops concentrated in the Northeast and no Japanese officials living in "Manchuria," the "Manchukuo" would immediately collapse. The so-called initiation of "self-defense rights" is also a complete fabrication and not a fact at all. Apart from these two points, the fact that "Manchukuo" is a Japanese product is already a clear and obvious historical fact. Moreover, the number of Japanese officials in the puppet government has reached more than 600, and all the real power, both large and small, is in the hands of Japanese officials. Even if the "Manchukuo" prints the slogan "Four Harmonies" and posts "No Territorial Ambitions" everywhere, who would believe it?</p>
<p>(3) The Consequences of Japan's Invasion of the Northeast</p>
<p>The current global economic panic is becoming increasingly severe. Japan is a relatively backward industrial country among the world's industrial nations, so the damage seems shallower on the surface than in the United States and Germany. However, 500,000 unemployed workers and 7 billion in rural debt are enough to show Japan's decline. The military cliques believe that once they engage in foreign affairs, provoke wars, and expand territories, all difficulties can be resolved by meeting the gun with the blade. Since September 18th of last year, it has been more than a year. The Japanese army, with 100,000 soldiers, has been rampant in the three provinces and cannot be said to be not powerful. Moreover, Nobuyoshi Muto, as both ambassador to Manchuria, governor of Kwantung Leased Territory, and commander of the Kwantung Army, holds three positions in one, and his power cannot be said to be not great, and his momentum cannot be said to be not fierce. Yet, they are helpless against the Northeast volunteer army fighting hand-to-hand.</p>
<p>Protecting the safety of 200,000 overseas Chinese with 100,000 soldiers is truly an unprecedented event in the world. A few days ago, the Geneva riot, where 10,000 soldiers maintained order, was ridiculed by the informed, and the fact that one soldier was assigned to every fifteen people opened a strange chapter in the world. Little do they know that for every two Japanese expatriates, one soldier is assigned in "Manchuria" invaded by Japanese military cliques, which is more than strange. How much has been gained from spending more than 300 million yen annually? Our good neighbors should think about it deeply.</p>
<p>(4) The Awakening That the Japanese People Should Have</p>
<p>China and Japan share the same script and are of the same race and are both located in East Asia. Their cultural and historical ties and interests are closer than those of Britain and the United States across the ocean. However, militarism has created a national hatred between the Chinese and Japanese people that is not easy to resolve. To solve this problem, we sincerely wish that China and Japan can work together, but the current problem lies in Japan, not in our country. Therefore, the solution to the difficulties between China and Japan must first be subject to the following preconditions:</p>
<p>1. Japan must abandon its policy of aggression and return our three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>2. Japan must truly abandon militarism, and then peace can be maintained.</p>
<p>Only in this way can there be hope for resolving Japan's current economic panic, and the security of East Asia can be guaranteed. Japanese citizens, please consider it with your reason, think about it carefully, and do not rely on your temporary recklessness to leave disaster for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>It is said that Fularji has been regained; after a fierce battle lasting a full day and night, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated; Zhang Dianjiu's troops are pressing towards Heihe</h3>
<p>The Japanese army has added three brigades and one regiment to Heihe</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a military dispatch from the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association, a telegram from the Harbin commissioner states that Zhang Dianjiu's troops of the Soviet army attacked Fularji and encountered more than 700 Japanese soldiers of the Komatsu detachment in the Zhujiapo area. After a fierce battle lasting a full day and night, the entire Japanese army was annihilated. Zhang's troops then occupied Fularji. Zhang Yuting's regiment of Zhang's troops, numbering more than 1,000, crossed the river and pressed on Bu Kui. The enemy forces collapsed at the sight of the battle, and Bu Kui could be taken any day now. Jiang's army, Pu Datong's brigade and Li Zhenhua's brigade, revolted at the same time, and the momentum of the volunteer army is increasing. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen's 13th telegram arrived in Ping, saying that according to a telegram from Pang Bingshan (on the 11th night), more than 600 enemy soldiers, consisting of a joint force of infantry and cavalry, set out from Tangdi to attack our Fularji position. Our Zhang Brigade engaged the enemy in a fierce battle in Yaokule. The weather was extremely cold that night, with temperatures as low as ten degrees below zero Celsius. The Japanese army could not bear this severe cold and retreated in fear, suffering heavy casualties. The Japanese side repeatedly wanted to conduct peace talks, but our side has sternly refused. Our army adheres to the principle of "rather be shattered jade than unbroken tile" and vows not to compromise with the enemy. Although the Japanese army has threatened to launch a large-scale attack, it is difficult to have a solid activity due to the severe weather. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military authorities, because General Su Bingwen has firmly refused negotiations, seem to have decided to take action to deal with him. The Ministry of the Army announced today that hundreds of new soldiers are scheduled to depart from Tokyo tonight to join the division in Qiqihar. According to news from Shenyang, a part of the Hirosaki Division has left Jinzhou and is heading towards Qiqihar. The Japanese are deeply afraid that the 250 or so Japanese expatriates captured as hostages will be annihilated, so they have not taken military action against Su until now. This morning, a spokesman hinted that it may be necessary to sacrifice these people (16th Reuters Telegram).</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to news released by the Japanese side, fresh Japanese troops are now being transferred to the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is expected that a general offensive against Su Bingwen will begin soon. It is also noteworthy that the fresh Japanese troops are now coming directly from Dalian to Taonan. This place is the southern end station of the Taonan-Angangxi Railway, and it is connected to the Chinese Eastern Railway near Qiqihar. It is heard that the fresh troops include infantry, cavalry, and artillery. While the Japanese authorities are preparing a large-scale offensive, they are negotiating with Su Bingwen. The real main purpose of the Japanese's superficial attempt to negotiate the release of Japanese prisoners is to force Su Bingwen to return to the "Manchukuo" government. Su's revolt has greatly struck the "Manchukuo." If this negotiation is carried out, it will be held in Russian territory. The Japanese and Manchu representatives are now flying to Russian territory because trains must pass through the territory under the jurisdiction of the Soviet army, so they cannot travel by land. Yesterday, eight Japanese and Manchu representatives took two military planes to Doria in Russia, and then took a car to Mazifusyakia to contact Su Bingwen. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Department, because Su Bingwen refused to compromise, received a request from Commander Muto to add troops to northern Manchuria.

<p>Lytton's Proposal</p>
<h3>Our Country Decides to Decline Gently; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Instructed the Delegation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to news from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the matter of establishing a Northeast Advisory Council under Chapter 10 of the Lytton Report has been discussed by the Foreign Affairs Committee and a decision has been made to decline gently. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed our delegation in Geneva the day before yesterday that when the League of Nations Executive Council discusses the Lytton Report on the 21st of this month, our side will explain the reasons why it cannot accept it, because the pseudo-organization in the Northeast was established under the instigation of Japan and does not reflect the true intention of the people of the Northeast. Under the armed oppression of Japan and the pseudo-organization of Manchuria, the true will of the people cannot be expressed. If the advisory council is held in accordance with Lytton's proposal, the Northeast representatives would be disguised Japanese representatives. In fact, in addition to the official representatives of China and Japan, Japan also has the right to have Manchurian representatives, adding to the Japanese representatives. China's representatives will never be able to have a meeting in the same room with representatives of an officially unrecognized local government, creating a phenomenon unprecedented in the world. If the Manchurian representatives are produced by election by the Manchurian people, then it will be able to accept the meeting. When the League of Nations Executive Council meets, our delegation will proceed in accordance with this instruction. (16th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests to the Japanese Ambassador</h3>
<p>To Suppress the United Press's False Rumors</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese United Press has repeatedly spread rumors in the past, and the government has revoked its right to broadcast electricity and requested the Japanese Ambassador to suppress it. Later, the Tokyo headquarters sent a representative to Nanjing to express its delight to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promised not to publish inaccurate news in the future, and replaced its Beijing correspondent, and then its postal and telecommunications rights were restored. However, the company has recently relapsed and spread rumors. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has protested to the Japanese Ambassador, requesting that it be severely suppressed. The general idea is that Japanese-run newspapers and news agencies in China often have inaccurate records of the Chinese political situation, confusing the public, and seriously affecting security. Recently, the Beijing news released by the Japanese United Press on November 5 stated that Zhang Xueliang recently entrusted Foreign Minister Luo to send a letter to Feng Yuxiang, asking him to dispel the rumors of the North China independence and restoration movement, which proves that this movement does exist. It also claimed that the Anfu faction and the former Zhili faction formed a new union, with Yan Xishan, Han Fuju, and others as military leaders, and would sever relations with the government under Chiang Kai-shek's influence and expel Zhang Xueliang from the new organization, which is even more bizarre. After examining the company's repeated false rumors, the Chinese government suspended its power transmission rights and requested your embassy to suppress it. However, the company did not repent and continued to fabricate news for malicious propaganda, which is very inappropriate. Your Excellency should be sternly warned that you must not send such false news again in the future. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

However, other units, such as the Foreign Cloth and Miscellaneous Goods Division, the Sugar Division, the Donation Bureau, the Taste Hai Jingguo Donation, the Commodity Inspection Office, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, the overseas questioning section, and the security branch bureaus, each time when returning overseas Chinese disembark and pass through customs, they are subjected to more than a dozen inspections along the way. If they have foreign blankets for warmth, umbrellas and biscuits given as gifts, or fresh fruits, they are often taken to the bureau and detained, and heavy fines are imposed, becoming confiscated. When the company goes to negotiate, each unit ignores them. Even boatmen and porters arbitrarily extort money. Please quickly and diligently improve the treatment of overseas Chinese after they return home. Also, Zhai Zongxin, the director of the Municipal Overseas Chinese Affairs section, treats the overseas questioning office as a means of profit, charging protection fees, liaison fees, color photograph fees, and stamp fees without affixing stamps, harassing overseas Chinese applying for assistance.

<h3>The Debt Problem Will Become a Point of Contention Between the US Government and Congress</h3>
<p>Hoover Formulates a Plan to Continue Debt Moratorium</p>
<p>To Be Implemented After Obtaining Roosevelt's Consent</p>
<p>Congressional Opposition is Very Strong</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 15th – President Hoover is currently planning to grant debtor nations a further extension of the debt moratorium period for at least one year. If both Democratic and Republican leaders can agree to this, he will use this as a reply to Britain and France.</p>
<p>According to today's reports, President Hoover believes that all debtor nations, under the leadership of Britain and France, will jointly request reductions or cancellations. Therefore, he believes the best temporary solution is to extend the moratorium period. Hoover deeply believes that the previous debt moratorium saved Europe from further financial chaos, and the United States was also able to maintain its foreign markets and benefit from it. If the moratorium period is extended, all parties will benefit, and world trade will benefit. If economic conditions can show a slight recovery, the debtor nations will not be able to insist on reductions or cancellations.</p>
<p>It is said that after the President returns to Washington, he will draft an extension plan. After Roosevelt and his advisors come to Washington, they will discuss it in detail. At the same time, he will seek the opinions of Republican leaders. Once agreement is reached from all parties, it will be implemented. It is said that Hoover's plan will set a definite date for resuming payments, but it can still be temporarily changed after future talks with British and French representatives on the entire war debt issue. Hoover believes that extending the moratorium period while agreeing to negotiate the war debt issue is acceptable to Britain and France. However, Hoover also knows that this plan may encounter strong opposition in Congress. Today, he received a telegram stating that Rainey, who hopes to be the Speaker of the House in the next Congress, has already declared that there is little hope of supporting the extension of payments in the current or next Congress.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 15th – The Belgian Ambassador to Washington today submitted the Belgian government's memorandum on war debts to Secretary of State Stimson. It is said that the content is the same as that sent by the British and French governments two days ago.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 15th – House Democratic Leader Byrns declared that any action to revise the debt agreement will be rejected in the current or next Congress.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 15th – After the news of President Hoover's plan to extend the war debt moratorium period was released today, senators and representatives rose up in opposition. Therefore, all parties believe that the war debt issue is very thorny and may require a Solomon to resolve it. (Note: Solomon is said to be an extremely wise judge of ancient Judah, similar to Bao Longtu in Chinese folk tales). Senator Harrison hopes to succeed Republican Smoot as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Rainey also hopes to succeed as Speaker of the House. Both are key figures in the Democratic Party. Today, within hours of hearing the news of the moratorium extension plan, they successively declared their opposition. Harrison stated that he has never changed his opposition to revising or canceling war debts, and he does not even support continuing the moratorium. If President Hoover believes that there should be sympathetic action towards the demands of Britain, France, and Belgium, then he will convene a special session of Congress. He is sure that any agreement reached by Hoover and Roosevelt or other parties will not be binding on the US Congress.</p>
<p>Harrison is known as the quick-tongued leader of the Democratic Party. This statement was made in Yorkville, Mississippi. It is said that he will come to Washington soon to prepare for the Democratic Party meeting before the opening of Congress on December 5th. Rainey is already in Washington, and his wording is quite euphemistic, only saying that he seriously doubts that the bill to extend the moratorium can pass in the current or next Congress.</p>
<p>Those who support the war debt moratorium proposal are currently hiding behind the scenes and will only speak after the President returns to Washington and announces the complete plan. However, it is expected that their reason for support will be that the country's financial and political position has improved. For example, the National Bank's financial report released today shows that the total financial resources of the 6,085 national banks nationwide in September were $22,565,995,000, an increase of $198,284,000 from July 31st. Although it is still $3,180,609,000 less than the same period last year, it can be seen that the domestic economic situation has improved, and it is indeed progressing towards recovery as the President said. It seems that the moratorium period can be extended. However, some observers believe that the President's statement is just a trial balloon to gauge opinions from all sides. Since Congress cannot complete this matter before the war debt is due, the President will first gauge the intentions of the members of both houses in order to determine the plan.</p>
<h3>Amazing Achievement in the Scientific World: Robot Pilots Airplane</h3>
<p>Actually Soaring in the Air for Thirty-Seven Hours</p>
<p>Comparable to the Non-Refueling Endurance Record</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Los Angeles, 15th – Today, an airplane piloted by a robot landed safely after flying in the sky for thirty-seven hours and fifteen minutes, actually able to compete with the non-refueling endurance record of a single-person piloted aircraft by aviation experts. The difference is less than an hour, which can also be called an amazing achievement in the scientific world. Although aviator Monroe was on board, he was only in a monitoring position and never touched the piloting machinery. When the plane was soaring over the Glendale and surrounding areas of Los Angeles, it was completely controlled remotely from the ground. When the gasoline in the plane was about to run out, Monroe notified the ground, and the robot still used the machine to make a perfect landing. According to the single-person endurance record, it was created by aviator Spikuz on October 3rd of this year near Long Beach, here, with an endurance of thirty-eight hours and forty-eight seconds.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Conference Agenda First Discusses the Lytton Report</h3>

<h3>Gu Weijun Arrives in Geneva to Expose Matsuoka's Propaganda Efforts</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 15th – Gu Weijun has arrived here and mentioned the recent remarks made by Japanese representative Matsuoka, saying that the concept of a unified and powerful Chinese government expressed in the Lytton Report is now making the Japanese uneasy. Therefore, they are trying to criticize the situation in China through propaganda. In fact, tens of thousands of foreigners are now living peacefully within China, and the lives and property of Japanese people in China, even during the Japanese army's devastation of the three northeastern provinces and the bombing of Shanghai in the past fourteen months, have also been protected by China. China has no xenophobia.</p>
<h3>Japan is Busy Dealing with the League of Nations; Opinion Paper Revised Again</h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Paris, 15th – At present, the Japanese Affairs Bureau of the League of Nations, which has moved to Paris, was fully mobilized yesterday because Ambassador Yoshida to Turkey delivered the text of the opinion paper. With the assistance of Secretaries Shiozaki and Yoshizawa, they reviewed the report from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM on the 15th and reported it in detail to Representative Matsuoka. As a result of the review, it was found that there were several points that needed to be revised to adapt to the recent situation. A telegram has been sent to the local government for instructions, and they will come to Paris to liaise with Representatives Matsuoka and Nagaoka. Representative Sato, who is in charge of new strategies for dealing with the Council, departed for Paris from the disarmament conference on the morning of the 15th to go to Geneva.</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Meets with French Industrialists</h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Paris, 15th – French industrialists hope to invest surplus capital in Manchuria. At 1:00 PM on the 15th, they met with Representative Matsuoka at the Hotel Majestic to ask Representative Matsuoka to explain that maintaining the security of Manchuria is the basic condition for ensuring their rights and interests. Representative Matsuoka explained the actual situation in detail, saying that "Manchukuo" is extremely eager for rapid progress and development, and advised them to travel to the Far East to inspect everything. As a result, the intentions of the French industrialists became more active. Switzerland, the Netherlands, and other countries also hope to invest surplus capital, but they must wait for the outcome of the League of Nations' deliberations before considering specific plans. In the future, when the security of "Manchukuo" is established, funds will surely flow in from Europe one after another.</p>
<h3>Outline of Matsuoka's Speech at the League of Nations</h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Paris, 15th – The content of Representative Matsuoka's speech to the representatives of various countries at the Council on the 21st was decided at a meeting of the Japanese delegation on the 14th. After the form and wording are revised, it will be telegraphed to the Tokyo government for approval. The main points of the speech are as follows: ㈠ Japan's actions in Shanghai and Manchuria did not exceed the scope of self-defense. ㈠ The independence of "Manchukuo," although a result of Japan's self-defense actions, was inevitably, automatically, and decisively carried out by 30 million people. The Japanese government did not participate. To make Manchuria subordinate to China, which does not have the complete form of a country, is not only a misfortune for 30 million people, but also violates the fundamental strategy for the eternal peace of the Orient. Therefore, recognizing the independence of "Manchukuo" is the inevitable mission of maintaining peace in the Orient. ㈢ The only way to solve the Manchurian problem is to affirm everything as it is; other methods are not appropriate. ㈣ If this belief of the Japanese government is unacceptable, what other good strategies are there? This is what the 90 million people of Japan are willing to listen to with bated breath.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – A trial run between Geneva and Iwatsuki is being planned to relay the situation of the League of Nations Council in Geneva to Japan.

They waited for the radio waves at 6:20 AM, but the signal reception was quite difficult for the first ten minutes, but it gradually improved around 6:40 AM.</p>
<h3>Japanese People Believe That the Opinions of the International Committee Are Insignificant</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th – The idea of organizing an international committee to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute is considered insignificant by people here today. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the rumored establishment of a national committee by Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, and other countries with interests in China has no right to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, but can only report to the League of Nations, which will then resolve it. Japan has no objection to this proposal. If this move is still the League of Nations' wait-and-see policy towards Manchuria, Japan has no reason to oppose it. The Yomiuri Shimbun also opposes this proposal, believing that it only adds unnecessary complications and states that if the League of Nations had not accepted China's petition earlier, the Sino-Japanese dispute would not have become so complicated. The League of Nations' intervention is not based on reality, but on empty theories.</p>
<h3>Concerns About Japan's Finances; Saito to Visit Saionji</h3>

<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th – The budget for the coming year has reached an unprecedentedly huge amount in Japanese financial history. In particular, the general accounting needs to issue more than 900 million yen in public bonds, so there is a high level of criticism from all sides. Everyone is worried about the future of the national finances. Within the government, it is planned that after the next year's budget is officially decided, Prime Minister Saito will make a statement explaining the unavoidable reasons for compiling a huge budget. At the same time, a research committee will be established to study fundamental reforms of the finances to show that there is an intention to remedy the financial flaws. This statement has recently become quite powerful. Prime Minister Saito will consider specific methods with Finance Minister Takahashi and other relevant parties in the coming days.</p>

In fact, those who spread this rumor probably have political undertones. MacDonald's health has recovered after resting in the countryside.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Dublin, 15th – As expected, the impeachment motion against the Executive Leader of the Free State, De Valera, was rejected in Parliament today. However, the number of votes was not far apart. Seventy votes were in favor of impeachment, while five more were against it. The parties argued fiercely, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. When the Minister of Agriculture discussed export subsidies, he said that the government did not want to issue export subsidies for sheep. Therefore, the opposition party claimed that rural sheep farmers would suffer indescribable hardships. Cosgrave, who proposed the impeachment motion, said that today is the most serious period of national hardship. If the country does not overthrow the current government, it will suffer terrible pain and irreparable losses. The government itself has lost the possibility of resolving the honor of England, acting recklessly, and putting the country on a dangerous path politically and economically. De Valera replied that the purpose of British policy is to drive out the government supported by the people and restore the government that once cooperated wholeheartedly with Britain. As a result of the vote, the government won by five votes.</p>
<h3>Papen's Position Shaken</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 15th – Prime Minister Papen's position is now very dangerous. The National Socialist Party now has the support of the Socialist Party, because Papen has denounced the Socialist Party as the enemy of the people, so they refuse to discuss the political situation with Papen. The Socialist Party claims that Prime Minister Papen and the various political parties cannot coexist. All negotiations for organizing a new cabinet are matters for the President, not the Prime Minister.</p>
<h3>British Shipping Companies to Eliminate Chinese Crew Members</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th – Labour Party Member of Parliament Logan raised the issue of British ships employing many Chinese sailors in the Lower House today, paying particular attention to the fact that the Blue Funnel Line's Peimousse has 60 Chinese sailors, saying that the Ministry of Commerce should advise shipping companies to hire British sailors instead. Labour Party Member of Parliament Kok-ho said that people say they buy British goods, so they should also hire British people. Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce, Parkin, investigated the matter and found that the Peimousse ship mentioned by Logan encountered a storm 150 miles off the coast of Nicaragua on November 9th and almost suffered an accident.</p>
<h3>Trotsky Carries a Gun for Self-Defense</h3>
<p>▲ To Give a Lecture on the History of the Russian Revolution in Denmark</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Istanbul, 15th – Communist Party dissident leader Trotsky, who has been living in a villa on Prinkipo Island here for four years, quietly took his family aboard the Prague ship last night to Marseilles, and then to Denmark, which was completely unexpected. It is said that Trotsky is going to Copenhagen, Denmark, to give a lecture on the history of the Russian Revolution to the Association of Socialist Students. Before leaving, he received a notice from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs allowing him to pass through France to Denmark. However, it is said that Trotsky and his secretary both carried guns for self-defense to prevent accidents. It is expected that if Trotsky cannot find a comfortable place to live in France, he will soon return here.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Istanbul, Turkey, 15th – The Danish Embassy has certified that Trotsky, the famous leader of the left wing of the Russian Communist Party, will go to Denmark and his passport has been signed. According to reports, Trotsky will take his family to Denmark to give a lecture on the Russian Revolution. The original scheduled stay in Denmark was eight days, but it is expected to be extended. Trotsky plans to travel to Sweden and Norway from Denmark and then return to Prinkipo near Constantinople.</p>

<h3>Japan and the Puppet Organization Decide to Conclude a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation</h3>
<p>The Drafting of the Articles is Largely Completed; To Incite the Puppet State to Sign Next Spring</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of Japan's Reckless Actions Before and After the League of Nations Conference</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th – It is heard here that Japan and "Manchukuo" will soon begin negotiations on a commercial treaty. Its draft is about to be completed. It is heard that its main points are: ㈠ When the administrative system of "Manchukuo" is stable, Japan is willing to abandon consular jurisdiction. ㈡ Reciprocal treatment is the basis of the treaty. ㈢ Carefully respect the open door and equal opportunity principles.</p>
<h3>Draft Completed</h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th – Regarding commerce and navigation between Japan and Manchuria, the provisions of the Japan-Manchuria Protocol are still applied, as stipulated in the past. However, in light of the special relationship between the two countries recently, there are many unfavorable and inconvenient points. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to conclude a Japan-Manchuria Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. It has asked Dr. Saito Ryoei, legal adviser to the Kwantung Army, to draft the text. Dr. Saito went to Manchuria in mid-October to conduct on-the-spot investigations. At the same time, he contacted the top officials of "Manchukuo" on everything. He recently returned to Japan, contacted the leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Commerce, Treaty, and Asia Bureaus, and the South Manchuria Railway Investigation Department to draft the treaty text. It is now largely completed. A joint conference will be held with related parties such as the military, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to conduct a final review and investigation of the text. Then, negotiations with "Manchukuo" will begin. The start of the negotiations is expected to be next spring.</p>
<h3>Treaty Content</h3>
<p>The text of the treaty is currently being kept strictly confidential. The following is a summary of its principles: ㈠ On the condition that "Manchukuo" is striving to improve the judicial system, Japan will completely abolish all consular jurisdiction over "Manchukuo" after five years. ㈡ A tariff system will be formulated based on the reciprocal terms of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce that have not yet been realized. ㈢ The principles of open door and equal opportunity, as stipulated in the founding declaration of "Manchukuo," will be observed. Japan does not stipulate or conclude a tariff system that enjoys special benefits. These three major principles are the basis for all other issues, such as the exchange of consular envoys and the rights of the two countries' citizens to travel, immigrate, and do business. All these are stipulated as the principled standards for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and Manchuria. However, when concluding the Japan-Manchuria Treaty of Commerce in the future, the issue of consular jurisdiction that other countries hesitate to grant to China will be taken by Japan as a leading example for Manchuria. It can be said that it is a further step forward, which is extremely noteworthy.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th – The Ministry of Communications has decided to install aviation lighting in various places by April of next year to start nighttime flights from April, enabling Japan and Manchuria to connect in one day. The following times and routes have now been decided: (Downstream) Departs Tokyo at 6:00 PM, departs Osaka at 8:00 PM, arrives in Fukuoka at 11:00 PM, departs Fukuoka at 7:00 AM the next morning, arrives in Dalian at 4:00 PM. (Upstream) Departs Dalian at 7:50 AM, departs Fukuoka at 4:00 PM, departs Osaka at 7:00 PM, arrives in Tokyo at 9:00 PM. However, nighttime flights will only be for postal flights for the time being. The aircraft used is the Navy's ○○ model. Recently, the Ministry of Communications and Japan Air Transport Co., Ltd. will hold a joint conference to make concrete preparations.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 16th – It is heard here that Dr. Matsumoto, a member of the House of Peers, will soon be appointed as the Supreme Advisor to "Manchukuo."</p>
<h3>Ottawa Agreement Comes Into Effect</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th – The Ottawa Agreement has been approved by the British Emperor. The Ministry of Finance has now issued an order that the Ottawa preferential treatment measures, with some exceptions, will come into effect from tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, London, 15th – The British House of Lords has passed the Imperial Conference Agreements for the third time. The new tariffs will take effect at 6:00 PM tonight. The King's Commissioner, Mr. Kaiserston, and Lord Stonehenge have given their royal assent. The most important of the new tariffs is the tax on foreign wheat, which is two shillings per quarter. Foreign copper is taxed at two pence per pound, and flaxseed is taxed at 10% ad valorem. In the future, the most affected by the wheat tax will be the United States, Argentina, and the Soviet Union. The most affected by the copper tax will be Chile and the United States. Argentina will be the most affected by the flaxseed tax, as Argentina has always had a monopoly on the import of flaxseed into the United Kingdom. Now, new taxes are being levied to encourage the import of Indian flaxseed. However, according to the Ottawa Agreement, this tax can be abolished within six months if the British government decides to abolish it. However, the wheat and copper taxes are stipulated to be implemented for at least five years. As for meat, the United Kingdom only produces half of its domestic needs, so it remains on the list of tax-free items. However, the British government has guaranteed to restrict the import of foreign beef, lamb, and ham. It is expected that Congress will soon formulate restrictive regulations, affecting the United States, Argentina, Peru, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, and other countries. Regarding cotton, the British government has also agreed to cooperate with India to enable the Lancashire cotton industry to use more Indian cotton and reduce the import of American cotton.</p>
<h3>Japanese Wind Disaster Losses</h3>
<p>53 Dead, 62 Missing</p>
<p>40 Fishing Boats and Over 200 Fishermen Are Hopeless</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – According to the detailed reports subsequently received by the Police Affairs Bureau, the damage caused by the hurricane in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, Gunma, and Nagano Prefectures includes 53 dead, 46 injured, 62 missing, 172 houses destroyed by fire, 4,792 houses completely destroyed, and 50,202 houses flooded at their foundations.

<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th – The number of fishing boats centered on the Ishiki Islands in the ports of Onahama, Ena, and Toyama in Fukushima Prefecture that were wrecked by this storm is gradually becoming clear. As of last night, the report that reached the Ministry of Home Affairs stated that 40 motorboats and more than 250 fishermen on board were completely missing and there is little hope of finding them.</p>
<p>▲ Japan Federation News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – The Izu Islands were also hit by a hurricane, causing extensive damage, especially to agricultural products.</p>
<h3>Is Ugaki to Become President of the Minseito?</h3>
<p>Major Activity in Tokyo Political Circles</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th – With the grand military review completed, and amidst subtle changes in the political landscape, Ugaki, the Governor-General of Korea, arrived in Tokyo yesterday. Activities behind the scenes to promote the Governor-General in political circles have been rampant for some time. For example, Kawasaki Katsu, Yoshikawa Kichirobei, and Tanaka Man-itsu of the Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Party) met with General Ugaki in Osaka. Meanwhile, Yamamichi Jyoichi of the Kokumin Domei (National League), on his way back from giving speeches in Nagano, made a detour to Osaka to return to Tokyo in the same car with General Ugaki. The attitude of Ugaki faction members within the Minseito, such as Tomita, Don-bo, Kawa-saki, Tsugi-ta, etc., towards General Ugaki's arrival in Tokyo is highly noteworthy. In addition, there is talk of Itoh Takio outside the party also being involved in maneuvers. In short, the movement within the Minseito to prepare for the next cabinet reshuffle and to support Ugaki is becoming more profound than ever before. Although General Ugaki is not expected to immediately join the Minseito due to the surrounding circumstances, influential party members within the Minseito, even those not part of the Ugaki faction, generally hold the following view: If a cabinet has no hope of being formed, it would be better to welcome General Ugaki, a non-politician, and support him with the Minseito as the center, which would be a more effective strategy. Therefore, General Ugaki's movements while in Tokyo are highly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th – Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki, visited Prime Minister Saito at his official residence at 9:00 AM today to report on the situation of Korean governance and the budget for the coming year. Afterward, they exchanged opinions on issues such as the situation of bandits in Jian-dao (Jiandao, 간도 in Korean), border security, and the protection of Koreans in Manchuria. He then visited Minister of Colonial Affairs Naga and had the same report and discussion at 10 AM.</p>

<h3>Germany Still Unwilling to Participate in the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Due to France's Refusal to Recognize Arms Equality</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th – A spokesman for the Papen government stated that France's disarmament plan presented in Geneva may not enable Germany to quickly rejoin the Disarmament Conference. The French plan is based on the plan of the famous French theoretical organization for a European political organization. Germany does not object to the idea of ​​standardizing the European army, but the proposal to hand over arms to the League of Nations for management and distribution to attacked countries can be regarded as a fantasy. Germany does not want to participate in the Disarmament Conference until Europe grants it the right to equality in armaments, but France is determined not to recognize this right.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th – France's proposal to reduce armaments and ensure security, which has now been submitted to the core leadership of the Disarmament Conference, has aroused considerable goodwill. However, according to general criticism, the French plan is extremely complex. The US representative here [is critical of] an article recently published in the Japan Diplomatic Times by Mr. Tamaki Hanzawa, entitled "Re-addressing the Chinese People," in which the Northeast Incident is entirely blamed on China, while the author completely absolves himself of any responsibility, and attempts to lure the Chinese people with direct negotiations. The intentions and wording are extremely flawed. This newspaper has already written a rebuttal in its commentary column and translated the original text of Hanzawa here so that readers can understand the deceptive tactics of the Japanese, who will stop at nothing.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, Chinese compatriots seem to have realized that the anti-Japanese policy is not feasible. They seem to have experienced that relying solely on the League of Nations or the forces of third countries like the United States to put pressure on Japan has completely failed. At the same time, they are deeply aware that if they want a final resolution, they must base it on direct negotiations between China and Japan. We have given extremely earnest advice to the Chinese government and the Chinese people. The main points of this advice are: First, China should first withdraw its petition to the League regarding the Manchuria issue. Second, China should quickly establish a strong and lasting government capable of taking on the important task of direct negotiations between China and Japan. If China can truly implement these two conditions, then we would not hesitate to carefully consider the issue of Manchuria's suzerainty, which Chinese compatriots have lamented and considered the most important issue. This advice seems to have won some reaction from Chinese public opinion and has prompted considerable consideration by many informed people. As a result, the Chinese government's actual policies have violated our advice. Not only has it not withdrawn its petition to the League, but it has also newly appointed Gu Weijun as the plenipotentiary representative to the League and promoted various anti-Japanese policies. The policy of relying on the League directly and indirectly against Japan remains unchanged.</p>
<p>2. What will be the development of the situation as a result of this? In Japan, the recognition of Manchukuo has officially worsened the perception of China in the world. Not only that, but after the publication of the Lytton Report, the reality of China was exposed, which aroused a negative reaction from world public opinion toward China. The past sympathy for China has become a fleeting bubble. Shouldn't the Chinese people reflect on these facts?</p>
<p>However, how are these established facts unfolding? Now, let's first talk about Japan's recognition of Manchuria. Japan's recognition of Manchukuo is indeed a difficult issue for China. China's diplomacy is indeed in a deadlock because of Japan's recognition of Manchukuo. But this is definitely not Japan's intention to make things difficult for China, to put China's diplomacy in a deadlock. This is truly a sincere appeal, hoping that China can withdraw its petition to the League and declare its sincerity in direct negotiations between China and Japan, and not trap itself in difficulties or deadlocks. At the same time, before the recognition of Manchukuo, Japan did have a very clear attitude. At that time, as long as the other party had the sincerity to accept this proposal, (Japan would strongly advocate direct negotiations between China and Japan in the League). However, the Chinese government not only did not accept our earnest advice, but instead acted in reverse. As a result, Japan resolutely recognized Manchukuo. If we use the style of the Spring and Autumn Annals, we can say, "China's anti-Japanese policy and League dependence ultimately led Japan to recognize Manchukuo."</p>
<p>3. To make it easier for the Chinese people to understand, let us further explain the significance of the recognition of Manchukuo. As a result of Japan's recognition of Manchukuo, Manchuria has neither become Japanese territory nor a Japanese colony. On the contrary, Manchukuo can have independent sovereignty because of Japan's recognition. Manchukuo has obtained equal authority that does not take Japan's freedom as its own. Therefore, just for the convenience of Japan, rather than recognizing Manchukuo with equal sovereignty and increasing future worries, it would be more beneficial to sign a strict treaty with China to determine the nature of Manchuria. For example, the Kwantung Leased Territory has always been a region legally entrusted under Chinese sovereignty, but according to the Sino-Japanese Treaty, Japan already had lease rights, which amounted to almost complete control. What is the use of such paper sovereignty? When determining the nature of Manchuria, we no longer considered sovereignty to be a major issue, let alone suzerainty. However, has the Chinese government not considered these issues? Has it not been given the opportunity to comment on this issue? Isn't this a good proof that China has not withdrawn its petition to the League and has not declared its sincerity in direct negotiations between China and Japan? Therefore, from Japan's point of view, it cannot but believe that the Chinese government has abandoned Manchuria's sovereignty, suzerainty, and all rights to speak. The Chinese people must remember this fact.</p>
<p>4. Therefore, in fact, Manchuria is a masterless region. Japan can occupy it or even annex it. However, Japan has repeatedly declared to the world that Japan has no ambition for Manchuria. Of course, Japan does not want to directly rule Manchuria, nor does it want Manchuria to rely on China or the League of Nations. It has no choice but to tolerate the local independence movement. Recently, it has officially recognized the Manchukuo government. The governance of Manchuria can only rely on the talents of the residents of Manchuria. All of these are the aims of Japanese policy. In other words, Japan had to recognize the independence of Manchuria in order to avoid the suspicion of annexing Manchuria. This can be seen from the fact that Japan spent more than half a year just on the issue of recognition. During this period, it gave China ample opportunity to consider and gave China the time to study the best means. However, the Chinese government did not forgive Japan's true intentions and did not accept our advice, which ultimately determined the status of Manchuria today.</p>
<p>Therefore, the emergence of Manchukuo was not something that Japan took from China, but something that China itself abandoned. Because China itself did not exercise its right to speak, as a result, Manchukuo became independent and Japan recognized it. If there are Chinese people who hold different views on this accomplished fact, then let me tell you, rather than resenting Japan, you should blame your own government for not being good, and rather than blaming your own government, you should reflect on the failure of the anti-Japanese policy and the League-dependent policy. All of these are for the Chinese people to reflect on the issue of Manchukuo.</p>
<p>5. Next, let's talk about the relationship between the League of Nations and China. Since last year, China has regarded the League of Nations as its only savior, believing that crying to the League of Nations would definitely buy the sympathy of the League. But what is the situation today? Let's first discuss the Lytton Report that the Chinese government and public have been looking forward to. Of course, Japan will severely criticize this report. But is the report unconditionally beneficial to China? Wise Chinese compatriots should reflect on this. If China relies on this report and the League of Nations' awareness of China as shown in this report, how will China be dominated by the League in the future?</p>
<p>First, on the Manchuria issue, although Chinese compatriots have been clamoring to restore lost territory, pleading for the sympathy of the League's investigative countries, and eagerly hoping for the return of Manchuria, the Lytton Report has made it clear that "it is no longer possible to restore the situation before September of last year." At the same time, it advocates establishing a "broad" system of "autonomy." In this autonomous government, in addition to the condition that Japanese occupy a sufficient proportion, although the other contents are not very clear, on the other hand, it believes that any solution that does not consider the historical relationship between Japan and Manchuria will be invalid. At the same time, it advocates using an effective constabulary to maintain internal order in Manchuria. From these points of view, Manchuria's autonomy is an autonomy based on Japan's existing power. The so-called constabulary naturally refers to the current Japanese garrison in Manchuria. If that is the case, then the difference between Japan's independent recognition and the Lytton Report's Manchuria settlement plan is only a slight one. The only difference here is whether the League of Nations can seize the opportunity to intervene in Manchuria. At the same time, the investigation team's fundamental understanding of Manchuria is based on the fact that the sources of administration of mainland China and Manchuria must be separated. Therefore, the investigation team has given a judgment of "impossible" to China's so-called restoration of lost territory. Here, are the Chinese people still expecting the League to resolve the Manchuria issue?</p>
<p>6. The second is the issue of China itself. According to the predictions of the Lytton Report, it has already constituted the premise of China's international management. The articles in the report are written by outstanding diplomats. Naturally, the description is very clever and tactful. However, according to the investigation team's "view of China," China's political instability and the obstacles to Sino-Japanese relations are all cancers of peace in the Far East and fears of world peace. These "instabilities" are all due to China's lack of a strong central government. Therefore, in order to implement China's internal transformation, there must be temporary international cooperation. The so-called international cooperation is naturally international management. Although the report does not explain its method, it is clear that the purpose of the report is to say that China's internal strife, political disputes, and socio-economic instability will inevitably affect the instability of countries related to China, giving the peace of the world a heavy threat, so it must be resolved by international cooperation. The significance of China's expectations for the League of Nations' investigation team is obscured. The investigation team that China originally wanted to rely on as a lawyer has instead become a judge and ruled that China is guilty. Then, does China want to expose its dark side to the world and arouse the heavy pressure of international forces before inviting the investigation team to sue Japan? Or does China want to resist Japan on the one hand and willingly accept the heavy pressure of European and American countries on the other? Wise Chinese compatriots should calmly consider this proposal at this time.</p>
<p>7. There are many things about the Lytton Report that China should reflect on and savor. The most important thing to pay attention to here is of course the key point of the Manchuria autonomy plan and the China international management plan. Then, what is the atmosphere of the League of Nations itself? Recently, there has been a very great change. If the phrase "League atmosphere" has meaning, then we can say that the internal and external leading countries of the League, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and even the United States, have changed their public opinion trends on the Manchuria issue. "Japan is invading China, and China is an organized civilized country." Originally, the tension of the League of Nations started from these false premises. Now, European and American countries have abandoned this premise and are completely observing the Sino-Japanese issue from a new understanding. As a result, like the Lytton Report, European and American governments and public opinion have understood the particularity of the Far East and no longer lightly make judgments based on Western European international common sense. The problem that is now troubling the heads of the great powers in the League is the urgent problems of Europe itself, the problem of the League's own survival. In other words, before these problems, the Manchuria issue is a very small problem. If the League has to consider whether to lose Japan or China for the sake of the Manchuria issue, of course it will not lose Japan for the sake of China. Therefore, at future League meetings, we think it is unlikely that the League of Nations will destroy itself by breaking up the League itself because of China. Recently, public opinion in various countries has turned to a compromise pro-Japanese position. Even Sterling of the United States cannot but remain silent before these opinions. Aren't these the first issues that the Chinese people should seriously reflect on?</p>
<p>8. However, Chinese compatriots, are you still expecting the League of Nations now? Are you still planning to call the League of Nations the savior of China and entrust your fate to it? If China can truly rely on the League of Nations to open up its national destiny, Japan's interests may be sacrificed, and it will not be a pity to let go of Manchuria. However, the meaning of the League has already been revealed in the Lytton Report. The real meaning is China's international management and the white man's conquest of Asia. They are hoping for the Sino-Japanese conflict to sharpen their claws for plundering the Far East. This is like the three-nation intervention after the Sino-Japanese War and the lease of the Far East after the three-nation intervention. At the same time, it is also like the politicians of the Beiyang faction who induced the forces of the powers and opened the beginning of the partitioning of China. Now, the Kuomintang government's wrong League-dependent policy has opened the beginning of China's international management. These are all very obvious facts. Chinese compatriots, are you not indignant at the current situation?</p>
<p>Originally, Europeans and Americans are not very clear about the international politics of the East and the national psychology of the East. Therefore, Japan's consistent policy is not to allow Europe and the United States to interfere in the issues of East Asia. Therefore, Sino-Japanese disputes should be resolved based on direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. Japan itself not only did not file a complaint to the League of Nations, but also always hid China's shortcomings and shattered the plans of various countries for China whenever there was an opportunity (such as the Chinese railway management plan waiting for the Lincheng Incident) to protect China's independent sovereignty. This time, the Sino-Japanese issue was brought to the League of Nations, and the League's judgment was based on the premise of China's international management. This was completely expected. Therefore, Japan did not want to hope for the League's judgment on last year's sudden incident. Whenever China roared in the League, Japan always advocated direct Sino-Japanese negotiations and always hoped for a satisfactory resolution of the situation. However, the Chinese government used the League of Nations' lack of understanding of East Asian affairs as a rare commodity to live in, strongly slandering Japan and strongly inviting the League's intervention. As a result, it not only brought about today's accomplished facts and constituted the premise of international management, but also this issue is really related to the overall situation of East Asia and the fate of the entire East Asian nation, and it is not just a Manchuria issue. Therefore, wise Chinese compatriots must first overthrow this government and secondly, sweep away the government and traitorous politicians who brought about the demise of the country and renew the national policy.

<p>This plan seems to be still approved because it can be regarded as meeting Germany's demand for equality in armaments and making Germany resume participation in the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 15th – A Conservative MP asked Prime Minister MacDonald this afternoon whether the British government, now that France's plan for disarmament and security construction has been published, can assure the parliament that any proposal involving Britain and making it participate in international naval and military actions will not be accepted by the British government until it has been approved by the parliament. The Prime Minister only replied that negotiations are currently underway on this matter, and the government cannot but remain silent in accordance with its custom.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Acting Governor of Anhui Province's Telegram: To all Shanghai newspaper offices and all fellow villagers of Anhui abroad, gentlemen: In the past, Anhui Province planned to issue 5 million yuan in highway bonds to build highways throughout the province and had submitted a report to the central government for review. Now, it has been found that the food tax assigned as the bond fund is not of a permanent nature, and the conditions for the guarantee are not very suitable. The original plan should be revoked immediately, and funds should be raised separately. In order to facilitate fundraising, the denomination of the bond will be reduced to 2 million yuan. Once the funds are raised, a request for issuance will be submitted again. As for the resolution of the Seven Provinces Highway Conference in Hankou this time, Anhui Province should build more than 3,200 kilometers of highways within a time limit, which cannot be delayed. All food taxes designated as special funds for road construction have also been included in the special budget for construction. Once the above highways are gradually completed, the food tax should be stopped immediately. In addition to the resolution by the provincial government meeting and separate reports, I am afraid that it is not well known, so I hereby send a telegram to inform you. Wu Zhongxin bows and engraves.</p>
<h3>Important News: Wang Yunping Arrives in Jinan to Talk About</h3>
<p>Progress of the Anti-Japanese Army in Rehe</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wang Yunping, Commander-in-Chief of the Rehe Anti-Japanese Army and Commander of the First Route Army, arrived in Jinan yesterday from Peiping (Beijing). He originally planned to visit Jiang Bocheng to discuss raising donations in Shandong to help the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army. Later, he learned that Jiang had returned to Peiping, so he changed his visit to Zhang Weicun, the provincial reorganization committee, to discuss everything. I met Mr. Wang a moment ago. According to his talk about the task of coming to Jinan, one is to visit Jiang Bocheng because Jiang had previously introduced him to He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, in Peiping, so as to facilitate the liaison for helping the Northeast Volunteer Army. Later, due to the tension in Rehe, I was anxious to return to defend, so I could not go to Beijing. This time, I think I will visit Jiang again to make contact. The second is that Chen Shiquan, the Peiping Municipal Party Committee, introduced me to Zhang Weicun, the Shandong Provincial Reorganization Committee, to discuss raising donations to help the Northeast Volunteer Army. More than 1,000 sets of cotton clothes have been raised in Peiping. The Northeast is Shandong people's second hometown. At this time of ice and snow, the Northeast Volunteer Army is still fighting the Japanese in single clothes, so I deeply hope that Shandong compatriots will help as much as possible. As for the recent situation of the Volunteer Army, my troops are divided into two routes, with more than 15,000 people. I also serve as the commander of the First Route Army, with Jia Fuchen as the commander of the First Division and Wang Xingwu as the commander of the Second Division, stationed in Shangdaoshan, Chaqianmiao, Gongyingzi, and Zhanyu Hongxing area. On the 13th, when I was leaving Peiping, I received a telegram that Commander Jia had occupied Shuanggang and was about to meet with Su Bingwen in Taonan to attack Qiqihar. Li Siru, the commander of the Second Route Army, and Li Haifeng, the commander of the First Division, are stationed in Liaoxi Xindian, Sanbaoyingzi, Old Shaoguo, Liulongtai, and Banjita area, with Xindian, 30 miles away from Chaoyang, as the base camp. Li Haifeng's troops have reached Banjita, 60 miles away from Jinzhou, and will join forces with Ge Xiao's Da Dao Dui (Big Sword Unit) (5,000 people) in Lingnan to attack Jinzhou, which can be occupied in the near future. Ge's troops killed more than 100 Japanese soldiers in Lingnan. The Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties and is scared to death. The people in various places have a very good feeling towards the Anti-Japanese Army and cooperate in everything, welcoming them with pots of food and drink, and the morale is very high. I will meet with Zhang Weicun in Jinan to raise cotton clothes and other items, and then I will return to Rehe to prepare to kill the enemy. The letter from Chen Shiquan to Zhang Weicun is recorded as follows: "Brother Weicun Jianjian, Tu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of the Rehe Anti-Japanese Army, has been leading Li Siru, Li Haifeng, Jia Fuchen, Wang Xingwu, and other troops in Liaoxi to fight the Japanese bloody for half a year. The results have been seen in the newspapers, I hope you know it well. Recently, the weather in the border area is cold and frosty, and the soldiers are all wearing single clothes and empty stomachs. Comrade Wang came to Jinan to raise cotton clothes and supplies. I and the comrades in Peiping, in addition to doing our best to raise money, are deeply afraid that it is a drop in the bucket and will not help. I think people in Shandong regard the outside of the customs as their second hometown, and I think there is no lack of patriots who will generously contribute. I dare to ask you to help as much as possible and raise money widely. I am deeply grateful. Chen Shiquan bows." (14th)</p>
<h3>Overall Rectification of Embankment Affairs in Hubei Province by the Headquarters</h3>
<p>Concerning the Water Conservancy Bureau and the Embankment Works Bureau, and the Funds Custody Committee.</p>
<p>Original Projects Transferred to the National Economic Committee for Handling</p>
<p>A Water Conservancy and Embankment Works Clearance Committee is formed to conclude outstanding cases.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Commander-in-Chief Headquarters of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, concerned with the haphazard construction of embankments in Hubei Province and the embezzlement by officials, leading to last year's unprecedented floods, finds a thorough rectification necessary to eliminate chronic problems. On the 15th, the Hubei Provincial Government was ordered to abolish the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Embankment Works Bureau, and the Embankment Works Funds Custody Committee. All water conservancy and embankment works affairs are to be transferred to the National Economic Committee for overall management, and a letter was sent for verification. The original embankment works funds will continue to be collected as before. A new Custody Committee will be formed to be responsible for safekeeping, preventing misappropriation. The Headquarters will organize a Hubei Embankment Works Affairs Clearance Committee to clear outstanding cases. The regulations of the above two committees will be formulated and promulgated simultaneously, marking a major reform in Hubei's water conservancy and embankment works. The original order is recorded as follows (details of the regulations omitted):</p>
<p>Order to the Hubei Provincial Government: Water conservancy and embankments are crucial to the livelihood of the people, safeguarding farmland and facilitating irrigation and transportation. Therefore, officials are appointed to manage these affairs, bearing a significant responsibility. However, the floods this year caused devastation, with embankments along the Yangtze and Han rivers collapsing one after another, resulting in widespread inundation. People and livestock perished, and property was destroyed, marking a calamity unseen in a century. The root cause lies in the Hubei Provincial Government's negligence in construction affairs over the years, failing to implement comprehensive planning, adopting simplistic solutions, and neglecting oversight. There was a lack of preparation beforehand, and hasty action afterward, wasting national resources and causing a catastrophe. Thinking of this, we feel deep sorrow. The Hubei embankment funds receive a substantial amount of revenue each year, yet management is so careless, allowing officials to arbitrarily embezzle funds.</p>
<p>Corruption is rampant, and there is no regard for the lives and property of the people. Such greed is intolerable. A thorough reorganization is necessary to rectify the situation and prevent future disasters. Moreover, rivers and waterways generally span thousands of miles, traversing numerous provinces and counties. Comprehensive planning is essential to ensure overall prosperity. If regions are divided, it will be difficult to achieve perfection. Therefore, after last year's major disaster, the National Government's Flood Relief Committee developed an overall plan for embankment construction, benefiting various provinces, as evidenced by the facts. It is now verified that the embankment works constructed by the Flood Relief Committee have been transferred to the National Economic Committee. The Committee has the Jianghan Engineering Bureau in Hankou, which manages the Yangtze River embankments from Huangmei County to Tuomaobu in Jianli, and the Han River from Hankou to Shayang. All projects in the province fall within its jurisdiction. The province need not establish separate embankment works and water conservancy agencies, which only create redundancy. All projects can be integrated and managed by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau. The original Hubei Embankment Works Funds Custody Committee, Hubei Provincial Embankment Works Bureau, and Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, etc., are to be abolished to reduce redundancy and conserve resources. The various projects originally handled by the Water Conservancy Bureau and the Embankment Works Bureau should be transferred to the National Economic Committee for overall planning and management, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau should be responsible for managing them nearby. The original designated embankment works funds, such as the surcharges on customs duties, special taxes, and land taxes, should continue to be collected as before. A separate Custody Committee for special embankment funds should be formed to ensure that the funds are used exclusively for embankment works and water conservancy projects in the province, preventing unauthorized use, and ensuring proper auditing. The previous outstanding cases and various documents of the agencies should be handled by a Hubei Water Conservancy and Embankment Works Affairs Clearance Committee organized by the Headquarters.</p>
<p>Letter to the National Economic Committee: Water conservancy in Hubei is of great importance, and the collection of special embankment funds is intended for timely repairs to benefit the people. However, due to mismanagement over the years, corruption has been rampant, resulting in the squandering of funds and frequent floods. All embankment and water conservancy affairs in the province should be fundamentally reformed to eliminate chronic problems and conserve resources. Furthermore, water conservancy involves several provinces, and if each locality divides its own territory, it will be difficult to achieve overall success. Comprehensive planning is essential to centralize authority. The Hubei Water Conservancy Bureau, Hubei Provincial Embankment Works Bureau, and Hubei Embankment Works Funds Custody Committee are hereby abolished. All original embankment and water conservancy projects are to be transferred to your Committee for management and planning. All necessary projects and affairs should be undertaken by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau in Hankou. The original embankment funds, including the surcharges on customs duties, special taxes, and land taxes, should continue to be collected as before. A separate Custody Committee should be formed to be responsible for safekeeping, ensuring that all funds are used for embankment and water conservancy projects in the province and not diverted for other purposes. Regarding the outstanding cases and disputes related to the abolished bureaus and committees, the Headquarters will organize a Hubei Embankment Works Affairs Clearance Committee to conduct a thorough investigation and ensure closure.

<h3>Hunan Province Holds Anti-Smoking Publicity Week</h3>
<p>▲ Anti-Smoking Parade with 50,000 to 60,000 People</p>
<p>▲ Burning of Opium and Parading of Opium Offenders Through the Streets</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: To demonstrate its determination to ban opium, the Hunan Provincial Government has established an Anti-Smoking Committee, with He Jian as the chairman. Leaders from the Party, government, and military have been appointed as committee members to oversee all matters. The 34th Division under Chen Quzhen, which previously used special opium seedling taxes for military expenses, has been ordered to immediately cease registering opium seedlings. The provincial treasury will allocate 20,000 yuan per month starting from November to compensate for the loss. Meanwhile, Party, government, and military organizations, along with civic groups, have jointly organized the "Hunan People's Anti-Smoking Publicity Week General Assembly Preparatory Office." A street parade will be held at the Provincial Education Association grounds at 9:00 AM today (the 14th) to expand anti-smoking publicity. Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 people from all walks of life are expected to attend. All public and private schools in the provincial capital will be closed for the day to allow full participation. He Jian will preside over the assembly. After the ceremony, He Jian will report on the significance of the meeting, followed by speeches from Xie Zuyiao and Tan Changkai, members of the Provincial Party Committee. The main points can be summarized as follows: (1) Banning opium is essential to save the declining Chinese nation and preserve China's international reputation. (2) To ban opium, it is necessary to simultaneously prohibit cultivation, transportation, sale, and consumption. (3) To ban opium, the government and the people must work together. After the speeches, the assembly unanimously decided to elect ten representatives, including Quan Shi, Tan Huang, Yun Tang, Gan Chen, and Jie Shi, to petition the Party and government organs in writing. The petition calls for the immediate abolition of the special tax collection agency and the execution of opium offenders to demonstrate the government's and the people's unified determination to reject drugs. A telegram will also be sent to urge the entire country to strictly enforce the opium ban. At that time, Peng Changzhuo, chief of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, will bring 5,249 pieces of opium paraphernalia, 200.06 taels of raw opium, 254.06 taels of opium paste, 220 taels of opium residue, 56 taels of opium ash, five opium lamps, and thirty-six opium offenders, including Liu Qingxiang, who have been seized in recent days, to the assembly grounds. The opium paraphernalia, paste, etc., will be burned on the spot, and the opium offenders will be paraded through the streets. When the opium is burned, the procession will immediately depart, with automobiles leading the way and the opium offenders at the rear. The parade will proceed from the Provincial Education Association, through Shuifengjing, Xuegong Street, Beizheng Street, Yuanmen, Shangfu Zheng Street, Bajiaoting, Pozi Street, Taipingmen, Fuxingmen, and into Zhongshan West Road, before returning to the Provincial Education Association and dispersing. Along the way, slogans such as "Execute Opium Offenders" and "People Voluntarily Report Opium Offenders" will be chanted. Crowds of onlookers will line the streets. After the meeting, ten automobiles will be dispatched to various parts of Changsha City to distribute leaflets with the message "Admonishing Opium Addicts Not to Enter a Dead End." The opium offenders will be divided into four districts (east, south, west, and north), with ten soldiers escorting nine offenders in each district, and paraded through the streets of Changsha City. Two airplanes will also be dispatched to fly over the city and suburbs to distribute anti-smoking leaflets. From 2:00 PM onwards, publicity teams will simultaneously depart to publicize the necessity of banning opium. (The entire city is divided into 113 districts, with a publicity team assigned to each district. Each team, consisting of five to ten people, is formed by schools, government agencies, organizations, and Party branches at all levels. The publicity campaign will run from the 14th to the 20th, with on-site publicity from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM each afternoon.) Anti-smoking publicity teams will deliver speeches in public at every street corner and alleyway. At 2:30 PM, the petition representatives, Quan Shi, and others, will first go to the Provincial Government to personally deliver the petition, requesting the abolition of the special tax agency and the execution of opium offenders. He Jian will respond, fully accepting the second point, while stating that the special tax agency is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and promising to immediately telegraph the Ministry for consultation. Subsequently, the representatives will go to the Provincial Party Committee to petition. Zhu Haohuai, a committee member, will receive them and promise to promptly forward the two points of the petition to the government for action. Judging from today's situation, the atmosphere for banning opium in Hunan Province is indeed very tense. It is hoped that the authorities and the people will persevere and not slacken their efforts in the future. (November 14th)</p>

<h3>Local Correspondence Songjiang</h3>
<p>Bran Cake Industry Protests Business Tax The Bran Cake Trade Association of Fengjing Town in this county telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the business tax on the bran cake industry, as stipulated this time, is collected at a rate of 0.5%, which is more than four times higher than last year. It has been observed that the area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has suffered repeated military disasters and floods in recent years, and the people are impoverished to the extreme. This year, silk cocoons have plummeted in price, and rice prices have fallen sharply, and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Bran cake is used by rural people for raising livestock and fertilizing fields. Although the business tax is directly levied on merchants, it is indirectly taken from farmers. Imposing a heavy burden on the impoverished people will likely lead to desperation and affect public security. Moreover, during the lijin era, bran cake was never taxed. Even the business tax regulations do not explicitly stipulate taxation on bran cake. When the business tax was first implemented last year, the trade association, deeply aware of the country's financial difficulties, agreed to pay 0.1% for retail and 0.05% for wholesale, simply to endure the pain for the sake of the overall situation. Now, the tax rate has been increased drastically, which the people cannot bear. In recent years, fertilizer powder has been selling well in the market. Our country's native fertilizer materials have been encroached upon year after year, leaving them with almost no foothold. If domestic fertilizers are not supported and instead have their taxes increased, it is tantamount to suppressing domestic goods and promoting foreign goods. We implore you to investigate the situation and refrain from increasing the business tax on the bran cake industry, maintaining the original tax rate. We await your instructions with utmost urgency.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Notorious Bandit Captured in Hupu Wei Xing, an accomplice of the sea bandit leader Wang Fengyi, who has already been executed, previously ran rampant with Wang Kai in the Baimao Hupu area. After the five bandits were captured, Wei Xing fled and disappeared. Unexpectedly, during the autopsy of the unexplained death of Bu Xiaolin in Hupu a few days ago, a crowd of onlookers gathered, and Wei Xing was among them. Wu Jinsheng, the second captain of the stationed township patrol boat, recognized him and secretly led his patrolmen to arrest him. That night, he was escorted to the city and transferred to the county government. The investigating judge secretly interrogated him on the 15th. His testimony is still confidential and has not been released. A Robbery Occurs in Broad Daylight A place near the new county government building inside the Dadongmen gate is considered quite lively. At around 11:00 AM on the 14th, a villager came to the city to pay rent, carrying a large sum of money. While passing through that area, someone suddenly snatched his money and ran away. The villager was shocked and shouted, chasing after the thief. Fortunately, a police officer in the area intercepted the thief and took him to the police station. The thief claimed to be named Tu Agui, and his accomplices were Chen A'er and Wang Alin. They recently came to Changshu from Shatou, Taicang. When asked about the robbery of the villager, they confessed without hesitation. The police station then transferred Wang to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Police Arrest Armed Robbers Shi Shaoqing, a police officer at the Wuqiao Substation outside the North Gate, received a report from Zhang Guiqing and Li Zhenxiang that a man from Anhui named Dun Sen was carrying a weapon and intending to commit robbery at the dock of a certain shipping company under Wuqiao. The police officer sounded the alarm and took the reporters to the police station, then together with the patrol leader went to arrest Guo. A Browning pistol and four bullets were found on him. He was immediately sent to the Fifth Sub-bureau for interrogation. According to the reporters Zhang Guiqing, Li Zhenxiang, and Chen, Guo had invited them to join him in the robbery, but they refused to break the law and reported him. Guo evaded and prevaricated. He was then transferred to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Tragic News of the Suicide of the Manager of Sanmao The manager of Sanmao Southern Goods Store on Nanchang Street outside the South Gate, Qiang Bingxiang, was known for his loyalty, honesty, and frugality, and was deeply trusted by the store owner. Bingxiang had a younger brother named Juquan, who used to be a partner in Shengsheng Paper Store in the north. Because of losses from small deals, he owed more than 500 yuan, leading to the store's closure. Creditors pressed hard, so Bingxiang acted as guarantor. Last winter, because of his younger sister's marriage, Bingxiang alone paid for the expenses, causing a loss of more than 1,000 yuan to the store. Moreover, his wife was addicted to gambling, leading to accumulating debts and an increasingly difficult situation. The morning before, Bingxiang had an argument with his wife over financial issues. After the argument, his wife ran out in a fit of anger, jumping into the river nearby, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was rescued by passersby and did not drown. Bingxiang saw his wife crying and his children wailing, and feeling overwhelmed by grief at the state of his family, he developed a desire to end his life. So, yesterday morning, he secretly took arsenic and committed suicide. After taking the poison, he still went to Sanmao and sat in the store, secretly crying. About an hour later, he felt excruciating pain in his abdomen, followed by bleeding from all seven orifices. The shop assistants were shocked and immediately sent him to Puren Hospital, but it was too late to save him, and he died. Afterward, his elderly parents cried bitterly, almost passing out from grief, which was truly tragic.</p>

<p>County Party Department Opposes Public Sale of Opium The County Party Department recently heard that some people in Yangyi Township are discussing the public sale of opium. It was brought up for discussion at the committee meeting on the 15th, and it was decided: (1) To telegraph the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government to publish the details of the public sale of opium. (2) To telegraph all counties to take strict measures against the public sale agencies with the power of the masses. (3) To send a letter to the Public Security Bureau to investigate the situation of the public sale of opium in the county and report the details truthfully. (4) To order the lower-level Party departments, district offices, and Public Security Bureau, etc., to conduct a thorough investigation and report.</p>
<p>Sentencing in Bribery Case of Clerk The case of Ni Yuzhang, a court clerk, bribing Hu Jingqing, a judge of the former criminal court, on behalf of Wang Zeng'aizhu (nicknamed Mei Lanfang), a manufacturer of toxic pills in Nanzhai Township, was repeatedly heard in court. Yesterday (the 15th), Wang Zeng'aizhu was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and fined 1,200 yuan for manufacturing opium substitutes and paying bribes. Ni Yuzhang was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined 400 yuan for paying bribes. Zhou Chengzhi and Xu Lida were sentenced to six months of imprisonment for assisting in paying bribes.</p>
<p>County Government Executes Two Bandits The County Government previously arrested two bandits, Zhu Guidazhu and Gengda, based on information from the police team, etc. After separate interrogations, the bandits confessed to repeatedly committing major kidnapping and robbery cases. They were sentenced to death and reported to the Provincial Government for approval. An order was received on the evening of the 15th to execute them as planned.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, County Magistrate Zhang sent police to sign and bring the two bandits, Zhu Guida and others, to verify their identities and escort them to the execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Discusses Business Volume Regarding the declaration of business volume for business tax purposes, the Chamber of Commerce has held repeated consultations, but the declared amount is still short by 2 million yuan. In the recent meeting, apart from a small number of merchants who slightly increased their declared volume, the rest either did not attend or did not increase their volume, resulting in no result. The Chamber's Executive Committee reported that they will continue to encourage various industries to try their best to increase the declared volume, while also requesting the authorities to appropriately reduce the target to avoid failure. Unexpectedly, before the Chamber could give its final reply, the Tax Bureau began investigating the accounts of various businesses. The businesses being investigated, such as Hu Dade Tai, requested the Chamber to negotiate for a postponement. The Tax Bureau agreed to send the investigated figures to the Chamber for reference and to temporarily refrain from taking administrative actions. The accounts have been sent to the Chamber, and the investigation results show that most of them do not match. The Tax Bureau is even more assertive, demanding that the Chamber make a final decision promptly. Otherwise, it will continue to investigate the accounts and, at the same time, follow the Provincial Department's order to collect taxes on all businesses that engage in both wholesale and retail, based on the retail tax rate. The Chamber then convened another meeting with various industries yesterday to decide to increase the original declared volume by 10%.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approves Price Increase for Official Salt The salt produced by various salt production companies in Lianghuai Jinan Field is mostly sold to the four banks of Hubei, Hunan, Western Anhui, and Western Hunan. The salt price was verified and stipulated by the government in the third year of the Republic based on the cost situation at that time. By the 15th and 16th years of the Republic, the cost of various expenses under the company such as the stove grain shop, contract labor, handling charges, barge freight and ferry fees had increased with the level of social life. The company applied for a price increase, which was approved by the Ministry of Finance after repeated consideration. The price increase for each stone in Hubei and Hunan banks is 2.5 cents, the price increase for each stone in Western Huai is 1.5 cents, and the price increase for each stone in Anhui bank is 2 cents.</p>
<p>Construction Surtax Old Merchant Takes Over The case of the new and old merchants dispute over the slaughtering construction surtax in this county has not been resolved. The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the county government, stating that the slaughtering surtax is related to construction and cannot be stalled any longer. The Chamber requested to change the appointment and allow the old merchant Zhang Run Chuan to take over, following the Gao Dian Standard (the new appointed merchant has a nominal annual quota of 8,295 yuan, which is paid monthly, and the old debts are gradually paid half monthly, etc. It is heard that County Magistrate Ma has approved the request and telegraphed the Construction Department for instructions.</p>
<p>Muslim League Sets Up Cattle Inspection Office The Yangzhou City beef craze has subsided for a long time. Private sales are still seen in the streets and it has not been completely eliminated. The beef industry, in order to maintain their livelihood, has now contacted Dai Jingshan and others, the president of the Muslim League, and submitted a request to the county government to establish a cattle inspection office. All slaughter cattle are allowed to be slaughtered and taxes are collected by the head. The cattle are still prohibited from slaughter according to the order.</p>
<p>Construction Department Plans to Repair the West Embankment of the Canal Director of the Construction Department, Dong Xiujia, according to Xu Xicheng, Director of the Jiangbei Canal Construction Bureau, who stated in a letter that the West Embankment of the Canal is not only an important project, but it also guarantees the protection of the East Bank. However, funding is difficult to raise, and construction is not easy. It is estimated that more than 300,000 yuan is needed. He requested ways to raise funds, etc. He specifically reported to the provincial government for approval to allocate 100,000 yuan from the Cao lending bonds. In addition, he wrote a letter to Qin Jingyang and Xi Mingfan of the National Economic Commission, stating the importance of canal construction and that the National Flood Relief Commission, which had been incorporated into the association, had promised to assist with 200,000 yuan. Please continue to remember the record and</p>
<p>approve the allocation of 200,000 yuan to the Canal Construction Bureau for engineering needs.</p>

<h3>Returning from Siam</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Those who pay attention to the world situation all know the situation in Siam after the coup this year, because Siam not only belongs to the same race and continent as our country, but also became a republic from autocracy.</p>
<p>The Siamese people migrated south from the Pamir Plateau and are of the same race as our country. The history promulgated by the Ministry of Education of Siam says this: the ancestral home of the Siamese people was in China, but they were deceived by the Tang people to move south. It can be seen that the Siamese people have already recognized that they are a branch of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>This time, the Southwest Political Council and the Guangdong Provincial Government sent Lin Yizhong to congratulate the Siamese government on the success of the revolution and to investigate the situation in Siam after the coup; he has now returned to Guangdong to report on the general situation during the Joint Commemoration Week.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lin, China and Siam are not treaty countries, and the Siamese government has never received Chinese figures with political color; but this time it was different, and they were treated with national courtesy and were extremely grand; it can be seen that the Siamese government after the coup has improved its treatment of China. Moreover, the current deputy commanders of various armies and ministers of various departments are all descendants of overseas Chinese. For example, the sons-in-law of Mr. Xiao Fucheng are all holding important positions in the Siamese government; the speaker of the Senate, Mr. So-and-So, said that his family still keeps the "Guanglu Dafu" title plaque from China, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs is also from Wenchang County, China. The total population of Siam is 10 million, and overseas Chinese account for one-fifth; among them, Chaozhou people are the most numerous, followed by Fuzhou people. Siamese customs and habits are like a second Chaozhou, and it is really impossible to distinguish between Chinese and Siamese people; because overseas Chinese in Siam can serve as officials as soon as they pay the import tax; now the governors of various provinces in Siam are all filled by Chaozhou and Fuzhou people, etc.</p>
<p>Alas! Since the fall of Guandong, everyone has a feeling of "I look around, but there is nowhere to go;" but unexpectedly, within Siam, overseas Chinese still occupy so much power; after reading Mr. Lin's speech, everyone deserves to smile through tears. I especially introduce it to the general readers in order to encourage the spirit of our people to develop abroad.</p>
<h3>Relics from the January 28th Battle</h3>
<p>— Zou Tianma</p>
<p>丨Exhibition at Jinan University丨</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident last year, Zhabei became a war zone. The National Jinan University was first the headquarters of the 19th Route Army, and then a front-line hospital for the Red Cross. After the 19th Route Army retreated, it was occupied by the Japanese army. The school suffered terrible devastation, and all the school equipment and specimens were destroyed. Our country's institutions of higher education have become enemy barracks, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army withdrew, fortunately, the school's administrators worked hard, and within a few months, it gradually returned to its former appearance. Moreover, starting from this semester, the school is running its own power plant and printing house, and is also rigorously training students. This is not necessarily a good phenomenon in our country's education.</p>
<p>On the 11th and 12th of this month, the school held a chrysanthemum exhibition. On this occasion, the items left by the Japanese army in the school were also displayed. I once went to see it, and there were many clogs, stationery, stretchers, and miscellaneous items. There was also a shell of a bomb dropped from the air, and a set of Japanese monk's clothing. What deserves our attention are the more than ten paintings drawn by Japanese elementary school students. Japanese education emphasizes the training of national patriotism, from kindergarten to university, all with this as the main purpose. Therefore, after the Japanese army invaded our territory, the elementary school teachers in their country ordered children to draw cartoons that could stimulate the patriotism of the soldiers, and sent them to the army as a form of consolation. The items displayed at Jinan University were drawn by students from a certain Japanese elementary school and sent to the 19th Regiment. Some depict the Japanese flag flying in the wind, some depict Japanese soldiers holding guns, and some depict the killing of Chinese soldiers. In short, the intention is to stimulate the patriotism of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Wearing a new camel-hair robe, feeling warm all over, yet meeting people and shouting desperately: "How cold it is!

Talking is probably the only forte of the Chinese!</p>

<p>Sitting on the tram, one shouts: "When women come, you must give up your seat!" But before one's eyes, on one's knees, are trembling, crowded, thin, annoying, old women or men. Yet one sits there calmly, thinking: "How annoying, always crowding in here!"</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>How enthusiastic! On the streets, in the newspapers, one can see stores holding big sales, and the sales are also donating to the Volunteer Army. Thus, posters saying "Buy one more item, save one more life" are pasted in colorful splendor on the glass counters. Buying one more item can certainly save one more life, but how many percent is added to an item, and is it necessarily going to have such a great effect?</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>The newspapers publish donation announcements, stirring up only a few initiators.

Indeed, this is an achievement of liberation. However, the gossip about the "flower vase" in the organization is still prevalent. The female comrades, however, are so complacent, admitting, "If it weren't for liberation, how could I have a job? And such a leisurely job?"</p>
<h3>The Industry of Intellectuals</h3>
<p>— Tao Zai Dong</p>
<p>Since Tianxu used his skills to create Invincible Brand Tooth Powder, adding glory to national products and redeeming his status as a scholar through industry, public opinion has praised him. At the same time, there was Ding Rong. Ding Xu, as advertised in various newspapers, is the Hunan specialty exclusively sold by Changsha Huaxin Down Company 丨 Duck bedding and pillows. The function of down is not only to keep warm, but also to be a tool for floating on water. Its widespread sales throughout the country and gradual export have become an industry. More than ten years ago, this product simply did not exist. The creator, Deng Ming, was Ding Peng, courtesy name Tuanjiu, from Hengshan County, Hunan. His grandfather and great-grandfather were both members of the Hanlin Academy. After becoming officials, they returned to their hometowns and ran academies, passing down Confucianism through their family. Tuanjiu was a student in the county and graduated from Normal University, serving in the education field with distinction. In his spare time, he studied the manufacture of duck down, repeatedly failing and losing money, with relatives and friends laughing at him. Tuanjiu persevered and finally succeeded, obtaining a special permit from the government. From then on, the term "Ding Rong" spread. In saying this, it is believed that studying should seek useful knowledge. It is hoped that the intelligence and talent of our youth should be used in useful industrial and commercial enterprises. Being just a writer is not enough. One must be like Chen Xuyuan and Ding Tuanjiu to be worthy of being called an intellectual.</p>
<h3>The True Reclusive Flower</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>丨Still in the Human World丨</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Zhanlu calls the current chrysanthemums "political figures among flowers." Even if the colorful hundreds of varieties of famous chrysanthemums were to turn into people, grow mouths, they could not strongly argue with old Cheng. However, there is a type of chrysanthemum that does not deserve blame. It still possesses the high spirit and refined taste of reclusion, preserving the proper color of "gathering yellow flowers" from that year. Even if the old master of the eastern fence were reborn today, he would not feel any shame in front of it. Moreover, Zhou Maoshu, upon seeing it, would still call it the "reclusive flower." Because it originally does not want to be among the grand chrysanthemum gatherings. And the chrysanthemum gatherings do not need it either. Those tea houses, restaurants, and theaters; it certainly would never set foot in them its entire life, let alone anything else. Where exactly is this type of chrysanthemum? It's just that Brother Zhanlu is always in his study in the city, and hasn't gone to wander in the desolate countryside, so he naturally wouldn't encounter the truly old-fashioned reclusive flower. However, this truly old-fashioned reclusive flower has long been criticized by people by adding a word to it, calling it "wild chrysanthemum." It's as if people who are used to showing off now see a simply dressed, honest, and experienced person, and refuse to give him a civilized title, but want to privately bestow the uncivilized word "wild" upon him. Little do they know that the wild chrysanthemum, which the world doesn't value, its flowers and leaves can be used to make medicine and treat illnesses. It's not like the colorful, political-natured chrysanthemums, which, besides being used for people to play with, have no other use. Therefore, I want to specially bring it up and tell people about it. Since Brother Zhanlu used the words "political figures among flowers" to ridicule chrysanthemums, he must have nothing but love and respect for the truly old-fashioned reclusive flower. Brother Zhanlu must also say that I almost forgot; I almost forgot; isn't that so?</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>— Ming Xin</p>
<p>The colleagues of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, in order to support the Northeastern Volunteer Army, will hold theatrical performances at the Sanxing Stage on the 14th and 15th of this month to raise funds. The tickets are divided into three types: two yuan, one yuan, and five jiao. A total of more than 5,000 tickets have been issued, and the audience has been completely full for two days. The plays performed were all of high quality, especially the fact that some well-known women, who usually do not perform easily, were able to generously sacrifice their beauty, which was most commendable. It is also learned that the colleagues of the railway will continue to perform in the capital for two days, still appealing for the Northeastern Volunteer Army.</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of Death (16)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>She didn't want to; she was afraid that using her real surname would lead people to investigate and find out about her background. It was a pity that her parents had passed away early, and she had no close relatives. Only then did she become someone's adopted daughter-in-law. She was very young at the time, so she didn't remember her surname. This was a matter of careful consideration. After much deliberation, she chose the most luxurious surname in modern times from the Hundred Family Surnames, and took the surname Jiang.</p>
<p>Again, the gossip magazine contributors were busy, taking photos, printing business cards, writing promotional materials, recognizing a "sugar daddy," one by one, step by step. Soon, she became popular, almost overshadowing the old pro 丨 Little Pearl 丨. Sure enough, as Little Pearl had expected, she didn't have to worry about food, clothing, or housing. Those willing to provide for her were endless, and she was worried that she couldn't accept all their kindness. Indeed, the clothes in the four small suitcases she brought were no longer needed. Whether it was raining or late, without makeup, she would occasionally throw something on, but she was still afraid of being caught by uninvited guests, causing them to gossip. She really sent them all to the pawnshop. Little Pearl said to her:</p>
<p>"Are you really willing to throw away a pair of silk stockings? I'm afraid they were bought just the day before yesterday."</p>
<p>Ai Li said, "There's a small hole in them, can't wear them anymore."</p>
<p>Little Pearl said, "When I was in Suzhou, I still saw you using a hook to pull threads from a torn sock to patch a hole in a new sock. Could it be that you've forgotten already, after being in Shanghai for less than three months?"</p>
<p>Ai Meng gave Little Pearl a cigarette, lit one for herself, sat on the sofa, tilted her head back, pursed her lips, and exhaled circles of smoke, smiling with her cheeks puffed out. After a long time, she said:</p>
<p>"People are cheap. I think those who wear 26-yuan-a-pair silk stockings are even more wasteful than us."</p>
<p>Ai Gu had fallen deeply in love with Ai Li. Everything had changed except for a scar about half an inch from her left eyebrow, which, although covered by her hair, would inadvertently show. This was indelible. It was the scar she got when she was ten years old, chasing water in Cuiwei Village, and was stabbed by A Gen's bamboo pole.</p>

New transactions from all parties were not smooth.

<h3>Yarn Flower and Yarn Market Continued to Decline</h3>
<p>丨The Actual Need Feels Too Stiff丨</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still falling, but it has not yet reached a drastic point, because of the bottom disk relationship, although people's hearts are mostly tired of seeing the multi-headed, but the atmosphere of selling is not very fierce, in short, the actual need is too stagnant, and in the blink of an eye, the end of the year is approaching, and the market is in a weak and depressed state, this month the Huai River has broken through the 40 tael barrier.</p>
<p>This month, the yarn broke into 40 taels The people marked the opening of the previous market, and the trading in the US cotton Pingding field was still small. Each month rose slightly by two or four cents. In the afternoon, Rongxing's multi-headed closed, and each month fell by two, five, six, and seven cents. The total daily transaction was 28,500 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>丨Scarce Source, No Sufficient Amount of Thrown-Out Volume for Spot Delivery丨</p>
<p>The cotton market remains firm due to a lack of sources from all directions. The amount thrown out by a certain manufacturer does not provide a sufficient amount of spot cotton for delivery. Currently, the spot price outside is one to two taels higher than the standard, so it is more cost-effective to offset in futures contracts. As for the small amount of goods shipped from various producing areas and the high prices reported, although the yarn market has fallen, the cotton market remains high. Judging from the general trend, the factory side feels increasingly difficult due to the situation of expensive cotton and cheap yarn.</p>
<p>Few New Sellers in Zheng Biao Market. Zheng Biao Cloth Opening: With American cotton stable, there were few new sellers in the market. Prices for all months rose by 1.2 qian, and then by another 0.5 fen. However, a certain manufacturer continued to throw out contracts in distant months.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Turns Cloudy, Prices Rise by 5-6 Jiao</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the source was even scarcer than before, about equivalent to the number of receipts cleared. Sales in the market were brisk, with distilleries purchasing, and prices jumped by 6-7 chi. Early and late rice, as well as Su-Tong types, all rose by 1-2 chi. Foreign glutinous rice was tight and secondarily priced.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Thirty to forty boats arrived from various groups on the Suzhou River. There was no activity in the market. Changshu and Beichuan had slight hoarding households. Opening prices rose and fell by 2 jiao. Bo Rice "Flying Phoenix" from Ningbo had some demand, and followed the rise by about 1 jiao. Spot goods became scarce, and prices rose by 3 chi. The total volume opened for the day was 3,000-4,000 shi.</p>
<h3>Foreign Kexian Rice Sales Stagnant, Market Seen as Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign Kexian rice market was stagnant and without activity. The market was also seen as weak because there were more and more shipments of Kexian rice, and there were goods in storage on the market. The stock in the warehouses has reached more than 5,000, and there are also 4,000-5,000 bags on the way, which will arrive soon. Because the price in the producing area has fallen, it happened to coincide with the lively time in the Shanghai market, which aroused the transport of various groups. However, as soon as the transportation increased, the price immediately fell. After observing the situation, the situation immediately became sluggish. Although Fuzhou and the Beibang still had purchasing demand, in view of the poor market conditions, they also held back and did not move, waiting for the price to fall before purchasing. The market is focusing on Heshang rice, so there were no transactions for the whole day. There are 600,000 bags of foreign rice in storage, although most of them cannot be moved. However, with such a large amount of inventory and the domestic new rice harvest, people's anxieties are self-evident. The outlook for the future market does not seem optimistic.</p>
<h3>Biao Flour Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>丨Bidding Prices Slightly Better Before Closing丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market in each month lacked momentum and showed a flat and weak trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell by about 1-2 jiao. Sentiment in both near and far terms was the weakest. Spot goods in this month, the Beiyang group has seen urgency due to the river closure guarantee, but once the river is closed, this sales channel will inevitably be inferior. In the long-term months, sales were not smooth, and it was also seen as flat and weak, down from the previous day's closing price by 0.05 to 1.25 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, it initially hovered and then prices rose slightly due to the limited amount of factory throws. The number of lots issued by the Yu and Fu factories were very few. The bidding prices in each lot were slightly better. As for the situation of current Australian wheat, it was heard that two more ships were transacted, with the loading date on December 2, and the price was 3 taels, 5 qian, 4.5 fen, and the reported price was 4.75 li. Due to the exchange rate, the bidding price was slightly higher. The Australian wheat was gradually being actively booked. The subsequent rise and fall will depend entirely on how the sales market goes. As a result, this month was unchanged, December was up 2.5 li, January was down 2.5 li, and February, March, and April were down 0.5 li.</p>
<h3>The Reason for the Lively Period Wheat</h3>
<p>丨Spot Goods are Not Abundant, Covering Short Positions丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the period wheat market opened in the morning, the market in each month showed a rather lively trend. Although foreign wheat was gradually actively booked and the current quoted price was not expensive, according to the current situation, it was indeed active, but because the number of chips in the market was really not abundant, it was easy to fluctuate if the buying sentiment was slightly strong. In the morning, each lot was covering short positions, and near and far terms seemed to be better by 1-2 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was reported that factories had booked two more ships of Australian wheat. Although this situation has no direct impact, the supply of foreign wheat will not be a problem in the future. Therefore, the sentiment was slightly soft. As a result, January was up 2 fen, March was down 1 fen, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Long Positions Liquidated</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that Chicago wheat on Tuesday rose first due to continued buying by Eastern speculative groups, and then fell back slightly due to profit-taking. As a result, each period fell by 0.875 fen compared to the previous day. Also, the transaction volume on the 14th was a total of 30 million bushels. The market prices on the 15th are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December 45.125 Decrease 0.875</p>
<p>May 50.000 Decrease 0.875</p>
<p>July 51.125 Decrease 0.875</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Sales Gradually Moving</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli have seen slightly more activity in sales recently. Sales in this market have been better, with more than 100 packages opened for sale, priced at 18 taels and 6 qian. The local price is 25 taels and 45 qian per zha, and the weak trend is flat. The inventory here is not large, totaling about 500 packages. Yantai vermicelli are also scarce. The market price yesterday was 19 taels for the top brand, 18 taels and 8 qian for the second, and 18 taels and 45 qian for the southern brand. The market price has reached a considerable level. If sales are smooth in the future, there should be a rise in price.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Show Weakness Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a weakening trend again as the biao jin fell. The Public Association's quoted price for the 24th coarse sand white was still 14 taels, 8 qian, and 5 fen, but because of insufficient bidding, there were no transactions. The 18th medium sand white was 14 taels, and the 20th medium sand white was 14 taels and 3 qian, and the trend was also flat and weak. The 8th new Dutch red was 11 taels and a half, and the new 9th was 11 taels and 7 qian. The old stock of the 8th Huaxin goods was 11 taels and 05 fen, with a slight drop. The 90th old stock was 11 taels and 56 qian, with no change. The current inventory of domestic green sugar is scarce, and the market price could have risen slightly, but because sales are not smooth, the trend is also weak. Tizhuang green opened at 9 taels and 56 qian, Huangjue Qing opened at 9 taels and 4 qian, and Longjiang Qing opened at 9 taels to 9 qian, and money. It is heard that a new batch of Zhangdiao Qing has arrived at the Jianbang store. If the goods are dry and red, the price can be slightly increased.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: White Filature Prices from New York Still Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port still lacked progress. It is possible that although the silk scarf market in New York was active, the current filature purchases were still slack. In addition, the Japanese silk continued to arrive in abundance, and the price of silk tended to weaken. The price of white filature from New York was still low, and the factory said that it was difficult to sell at a loss.</p>
<h3>All Chen Cocoons from Wuxi Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>After receiving repeated notices from the Chen Silkworm Cocoon Commission in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, silkworm cocoon merchants in Wuxi have registered the Chen silkworm cocoons in their hands in accordance with the regulations. Since the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Bonds are about to be issued, the Chen dry cocoons stored in the warehouses of various cocoon merchants are now being loaded in batches and transported to Shanghai for storage or entrusted to silk factories for processing. More than 20,000 packages of Chen cocoons in Wuxi have now been transported to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Needle Eyebrow Tea Transaction Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port saw quite brisk transactions in the "Needle Eyebrow" and green teas that arrived. The demand from British firms such as Tianxiang Changshi and others was generally good, and the market was turning firm again. Although there were scattered transactions in other varieties of tea such as Eyebrow Pearl Tea, the prices recognized by experts were still tight. The movement of goods from the Liyuan and Northwest routes was very sluggish. The market for medium- and low-grade green tea has stabilized, while the situation for high-grade tea is still difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Hardware: English Galvanized Iron Few Actual Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market still presented a mediocre situation. The goods opened were still not in large quantities, but because the fixed prices were high and the foreign exchange was strong, the sentiment was good, so there were few reductions. However, English galvanized iron, which has long been known for its brisk sales, has had few actual sales and little activity in recent days. The market situation shows a strong exterior and a weak interior. It is estimated that 36-inch sheets are 8 qian and 2 fen each, 37-inch sheets are 9 qian and 6.5 fen, 28 gauge is 12 taels and 2 qian, 26 gauge is 11 taels and 7 qian and a half, 24 gauge is 11 taels and 5 qian, and 22 gauge is 11 taels and 2 qian and a half. As for transactions, it is heard that there were two or three hundred bundles of 37-inch sheets opened for sale. Apart from inquiries, there were no purchases of 36-inch sheets and thick varieties. It is heard that foreign firms have recently been opening their spot goods in succession, so the future of standards will inevitably be affected. As for the galvanized iron produced by the Shanghai factory, it is difficult to calculate the cost because the cost is high, so the amount opened in the market is also a drop in the bucket.</p>
<h3>Textile: Increasingly Popular Genuine Horsehair Braid</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market atmosphere in the Public Association was very good, and the prices of various goods remained stable. Only the genuine horsehair braid lining became increasingly popular, and the selling price increased steadily. Wholesale prices have been bid up to 1 tael and 3 qian and a half per yard. There is not much stock in the market, and those who hold the goods are considering it extraordinary. As the weather suddenly turns cold, sales have increased sharply, and buyers need to use it, so they have to raise prices. If no new goods arrive in the future, the price will still have to rise.</p>
<h3>Coal: Liujiang Coal Price Rises, Sales Brisk</h3>
<p>The sales of Liujiang white coal have been quite good in recent days, with daily transactions often reaching three to four hundred tons. Yesterday, there were more than 410 tons opened for sale, and the selling price per ton has risen by 5 qian, so the current selling price is 14 taels per ton.</p>

<h3>Joint Association of Private Schools in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Declaration Demanding Subsidies to Develop Education</p>
<p>▲20% of the French Concession's Income Should Be Used for Chinese Education Expenses</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the French Concession of this city issued a declaration to request the French Public Works Bureau to develop Chinese education in the concession, stating:</p>
<p>"Since the opening of Shanghai as a port and the establishment of concessions by the French, more than 80 years have passed. The entire facilities of the concession need not be discussed too much. Just in terms of the tax obligations fulfilled by our Chinese people, the accumulated years have been enormous. According to reason and sentiment, our Chinese people should have the right to enjoy equality. However, the fact is greatly different. For education, which is considered the most important relationship for our people, very little attention is paid. Our national government, with the tax revenue of the concession in the hands of the French, is also limited by its economic power and cannot pay much attention. A small number of private schools have been established, but they are all unable to expand due to financial exhaustion, causing numerous students to have no way to study. This is indeed what our people are deeply dissatisfied with and cannot help but say. According to the latest statistics from the French Public Works Bureau, the population of the French Concession totals 479,571 people, of which Chinese account for 462,342 people, and the number of school-age children is as high as 128,437. Western children account for only 2,737 people. According to the 1932 budget of the French Public Works Bureau, the total annual income is approximately 6,921,732 taels. With such a large number of school-age children, how much funding should be used to establish how many schools, and how many Chinese children's schools should be re-established so that Chinese children will no longer sigh that they have no education? However, the French Public Works Bureau has failed to take this into account. In a jurisdiction with so many school-age children and such a large total annual tax revenue, it has only allocated 218,200 taels for education expenses and established three or four schools. It is estimated that Western public schools account for 130,000 taels, the Sino-French Academy accounts for 60,000 taels, and the newly established Chinese children's primary schools account for approximately 20,000 taels. Schools that are exempt from donations account for 8,200 taels. From this point of view, 24. Supervise and urge the government to recover the educational rights of the concession. It was resolved to submit the case to the Education Bureau. 5. Request the Public Works Bureau to exempt the advertising tax and handling fees for schools established with the approval of the Education Bureau. It was resolved to send a letter to the Public Works Bureau for approval. 3. Draft work plans for each department. It was resolved that the heads of each department should draft them within one week. 4. Appoint persons in charge of each group of the Research Committee. It was resolved to appoint Zheng Hongnian for the university education group, Tao Baichuan for the secondary school education group, Wu Xiu for the primary school education group, and Zhang Zaibo for the social education group. 5. The Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the French Concession sent a letter requesting that the French Concession Public Works Bureau unanimously allocate 20% of all income to Chinese education expenses. It was resolved that: 1. A letter should be sent to the Chinese directors of the French Municipal Council to strive for it. 2. A declaration should be issued. The meeting was adjourned after the discussion."</p>
<h3>Storytelling Competition Still Has Four Days</h3>
<p>▲Scheduled Gathering After Closing to Award Prizes</p>
<p>▲Important Competition to Continue</p>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the storytelling competition. The Yangzhou storytelling performance was quite tense. Starting today (the 17th), Guangyu Society members will continue to perform ballads and storytelling. The competition will close on the 20th, and the judges will meet on the 21st to discuss the results. The Education Bureau will then schedule a gathering to award prizes to the competitors. It is also heard that after this storytelling competition is concluded, the bureau will, on one hand, make further plans to organize and improve ballads and storytelling, and on the other hand, prepare to hold a city-wide humorous performance competition and various other miscellaneous competitions to promote social education in many ways. The rules and regulations have already been drafted by the bureau's Drama Review Committee.</p>
<h3>Legal and Health Counselor Meeting Held by the Vocational Guidance Institute</h3>
<p>Last night at 6 p.m., the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute of the China Vocational Education Society invited health counselors Song Guobin, Wang Yugang, Zeng Lixun, Ge Chenghui, Zhang Zhongming, Chen Bangdian, Huang Yixiang, Yang Baohang, Wang Zhenchuan, Xu Jihua, legal counselors Zhu Shaowen, Shan Yuhua, Qian Jianqiu, Wang Zhengshao, Yu Zhijiang, Yuan Yang'an, Li Zhongdao, Peng Yanghou, Huang Zixiong, etc., to hold a joint meeting at Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant. The director of the society, Mr. Jiang Wenyu, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, welcoming the counselors present and thanking them for their enthusiasm in guiding young people. Then, the deputy director, Mr. Yang Weiyu, delivered a speech with the same meaning. Next, the director of the institute, Hua Zhanen Pan Yangyao, reported on the progress of health and legal guidance at the institute in the past three years. In general, legal matters mainly involved divorce and inheritance cases, while health matters mainly involved sexual neurasthenia. Then, Wang Yugang, Zhu Shaowen, Li Zhongdao, and Shan Yuhua successively expressed their opinions, mainly as follows: (1) Dr. Wang Yugang advocated that young people who seek health guidance before becoming ill should be considered within the scope of health guidance, and the health counselors invited by the institute should provide guidance once a month. The names of all counselors and the dates and times should be disclosed by the institute in advance. Young people who are already ill and seek guidance should be considered as seeking disease guidance, which is not within the scope of health guidance, and should be referred by the institute to the counselors' clinics for diagnosis and treatment, with preferential treatment. (2) Lawyer Li Zhongdao advocated that legal issues should be divided into two categories: legal guidance and legal aid. Before the court trial, mediation work should be tried first. Shan Yuhua also supported this proposal. Finally, Zhu Shaowen was publicly recommended to draft a declaration on legal issues, hoping that young people would take divorce issues seriously. Mr. Jiang Wenyu, based on the diagnoses of various doctors, noted that in recent years, young students have been fond of reading erotic books and improper publications and enjoy talking about love, leading to an increasing number of cases of sexual neurasthenia. He drafted a declaration advising young people to pay attention to their health, hoping that young people would be alert. All the above issues were unanimously approved, and the meeting ended happily at 9 p.m.</p>
<h3>Fudan Alumni Hold Dinner Party</h3>
<p>A Banquet to Celebrate Guo Yun'guan's Appointment as Court President</p>
<p>A Farewell to Zhu Hexiang Who is Going to Nanyang for Investigation</p>
<p>Fudan University alumni Ye Zaoting, Zhang Zemin, Jin Tongyin, etc., in view of the fact that many alumni of the school during the Wusong Xujiahui era are serving in Shanghai, but there is rarely any contact among them, initiated a dinner party. The first dinner party was held last night with more than 20 attendees, all of whom were alumni who graduated about 20 years ago. Some had gray hair and some did not recognize each other. It was a joyous occasion to meet again. After a few rounds of drinks, Jin Tongyin stood up to give a speech, welcoming Guo Yun'guan's new appointment as the president of the Shanghai Special District Court, sending off Zhu Hexiang to Nanyang to investigate the situation of overseas Chinese, and deciding to name the dinner party the "Songhu Alumni Dinner Party" to be held once a year. After the meal, everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>Wu Jingxiong Lectures on the Art of Life</h3>
<p>At the Civic Education Center on the 20th of This Month</p>
<p>Of the 777 Western children, the educational expenses account for 130,000 taels, while the educational expenses for the 125,700 Chinese children of school age account for only 88,200 taels. What injustice in the world is greater than this? Moreover, Chinese people pay more than two-thirds of the entire French Concession's tax revenue. Now that the French Municipal Council is so indifferent to Chinese education, we cannot help but feel regret and deep dissatisfaction. According to the annual report of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, the total annual regular income is 15,537,220 taels, of which 1,186,920 taels are for Chinese education. Calculated proportionally, the French Municipal Council should allocate 5,287,666 taels for Chinese education. If we further calculate based on the 160,000 school-age children in the International Settlement and the current proportion of Chinese educational expenses, the French Municipal Council should allocate 9,089,050 taels for Chinese education. In comparison, the French Municipal Council's improper allocation is already obvious. Furthermore, we cannot be satisfied with the public concession's current facilities for Chinese education. In summary, we believe that developing Chinese education in the French Concession is an urgent task and a right that Chinese people in the French Concession should enjoy, and it is also a responsibility that the French Municipal Council should bear. For the current plan, the French Municipal Council should, at a minimum, allocate 20% of its total annual income to Chinese educational expenses. On the one hand, supplement the established private schools to seek expansion, and on the other hand, gradually increase the number of Chinese children's schools to seek universal education. The members of this association, bearing the important responsibility of education and witnessing this situation, cannot sit idly by. Therefore, we hereby initiate a request, hoping that people from all walks of life will provide assistance, and we especially hope that the Chinese directors and Chinese committee members will make a loud call to promote its realization. The members of this association especially vow to work tirelessly to promote the education of Chinese children. This is our declaration.</p>

<h3>Xiqing Women's Basketball Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Southeast Defeated Red Team</p>
<p>| 33 to 23 |</p>
<p>Liangjiang Defeated Junior by a Large Margin Chongde Lost to Green Team</p>
<p>The Xiqing Women's Basketball Association opened last night. Because the Jiangnan Sports Teacher gave up to the Xiqing Basketball Team, only among the four groups, the battle between the Southeast and Xiqing Red Team was the most intense. The strengths of the two teams are evenly matched. As a result, the Southeast won 33 to 23 with a slight advantage. It is a great enemy to the Southeast.</p>
<p>(1) Liangjiang A Won Over Junior ... 46 to 6 In the opening game, Liangjiang vs. Junior, the situation was very different. The Liangjiang team still had its prestige, the connection was very good, and the shooting was also accurate. The whole team was good at both offense and defense. The score continued to increase and the opponent Junior was incapable. They could not attack or defend. In the first quarter, Liangjiang scored 11 points and Junior did not record any. The situation was the same afterwards. Junior still did not improve. When Liangjiang scored 26 points, Junior finally opened the record and scored a precious two points. The first half ended with 26 to 2. From the third quarter, Junior added four points and Liangjiang added 16 points, making it 42 to 6. In the overall result, Liangjiang won by 46 to 6. Judging from Liangjiang's strength, there is still hope to maintain the championship.</p>

<p>Zhuang Mingzhen 0 times 0</p>
<p>Total 4 times 46</p>
<p>(2) American Women Won Over Liangjiang B ... 34 to 14 The competition between the American women and the Liangjiang B team was quite fierce, but there was less excitement. Mrs. An Li, the center of the American women's team, and Ms. Pu Shaxu had a good connection, and their movements were fast and their shots were accurate. Zhu Hehuang was more outstanding in Liangjiang B, but the team's basketball skills were still lacking. The first quarter was 8 to 3, the first half was 17 to 10, and the third quarter was 30 to 12. The result was 34 to 14, and the American women won. From the fourth quarter, the American team only played with five players due to the lack of substitutes after two players left the field.</p>
<p>▲American Women Fouls Score ▲Liangjiang Fouls Score</p>
<p>Pu Shaxu 3 times 10 Luo Qiyun 1 time 8 points</p>

<p>Total 7 times 34 Cai Qiao 0 times 0</p>
<p>Total 16 14</p>
<p>(3) Southeast Wins Red Team ... 33 to 23 The game between Southeast and Southwest Red Team was the most tense and important last night, because both teams are in the competition for the championship, and their strengths are not much different. As a result, the Southeast had a slight advantage and won 33 to 23. Southeast is not Huang and has a big enemy.</p>
<p>The Southeast Team Led All the Way Although the Red Team Scored a Point First with a Free Throw to Open the Record, the Southeast Immediately Returned Two Goals. As a Result, the Score Difference Between the Southeast and the Red Team Has Always Been 5 to 8 Points. The Southeast Always Leads the Team. The Red Team Never Lets Up and Follows Closely Behind. Therefore, a Tense Situation Appears. The Closest Time Was at the End of the First Half, When the Southeast Was Leading by Only Five Points at 18 to 13. The Peak of the Southeast Was 28 to 15, Leading by 13 Points.</p>
<p>Jie Hansheng is a Great Pillar of the Red Team The Points Scored by the Red Team Last Night Were Almost Entirely Due to Jie Hansheng Alone. 18 Points Were Scored Out of the 23 Points. The Red Team's Speed of Action is Faster Than the Southeast, and There Are Many Opportunities. However, Other Than One Forward Jie Hansheng, the Remaining Two Have No Way to Shoot the Basket. Otherwise, Southeast Would Have Been Restrained.</p>

<p>(4) Green Team Wins Chongde ... 60 to 6</p>
<p>In the last game, the Green Team of the Rowing Club defeated Chongde by a large score of 60 to 6. The first half was 25 to 6. Chongde's height was too short, while the Green Team was full of tall people, wide and large. Chongde's skills were good, but they could not do anything about it and could not do anything. They could not defend and could not attack. However, in the midst of the siege, Wang Xiangying also used three wonderful shots, which won a lot of praise.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Basketball Team Defeats Fudan University</h3>
<p>The Result Was 23 to 18</p>
<p>The Jiaotong University Basketball Team played a friendly match with the Fudan University Team at the Jiaotong University Gymnasium yesterday. As a result, Jiaotong University won 23 to 18. According to the Jiaotong University team, because they joined the Xiqing team this year, they started training only last week. This game was their debut. Although the connection and shooting skills were not top-notch, it was commendable that they were able to defeat the previously famous Fudan University. The skills of both sides were relatively average. However, the Jiaotong University team members were short, which was their disadvantage. In the first half, Fudan won 9 to 8. In the second half, Jiaotong University reversed the defeat and won 15 to 9. Both teams will have good efforts in the Xiqing Group A.</p>

<h3>This City's Reconstruction Public Bonds Underwritten by British Merchants</h3>
<p>Director Cai Issues Statement</p>
<p>Reports state that the Shanghai Reconstruction Public Bonds Regulations have been amended and passed by the Legislative Yuan, and the underwriting contract has also been signed. Yesterday, reporters from various newspapers inquired with the Finance Bureau about the underwriting situation. Director Cai issued the following statement:</p>
<p>(1) The public bonds, totaling 6 million yuan, are underwritten by the British firm Lih An &amp; Co. of Shanghai, and the HSBC Bank is entrusted to manage the repayment of principal and interest. The municipal government will receive 80% of the face value in real terms, amounting to 4.8 million silver dollars. (2) After Lih An &amp; Co. pays the amount of the underwriting, the municipal government will not interfere with how they promote the bonds. It is estimated that the firm will sell them at 85% of the face value, as the firm must bear all promotional expenses, such as advertising (the city's previous issuance of public bonds also incurred tens of thousands of dollars in expenses) and broker commissions. Therefore, the bond price must be increased slightly. (According to market practice, broker commissions are usually around 2% to 4%. The Shanghai Telephone Company's issuance of 20 million taels of public bonds had broker commissions ranging from 2% to 4%.) In the future, as the city's external credit improves, the selling price of these public bonds may continue to rise, exceeding 85%, which is also expected. (3) In the past decade or so, the HSBC Bank has rarely managed Chinese bonds. This time, the city's bonds are underwritten by Lih An &amp; Co., and the HSBC Bank is managing the repayment of principal and interest, which shows that the bank is well aware of the common economic interests and is able to cooperate. In the future, the city's construction projects will flourish, and we will rely heavily on the support of Chinese and foreign banking groups. This is just one aspect. (4) It is rare for Chinese domestic bonds to be underwritten by foreign merchants. Shanghai's initiative will excite foreigners' investment ideas, and various domestic bonds will be positively affected. (5) The public bonds have a term of 20 years for complete repayment.</p>
<p>The interest rate is 7%. Lih An &amp; Co. underwrites at 80% of the face value and pays the full amount without any commission. From the date of underwriting to the date of full repayment, the average annual interest rate is approximately 0.070668. In other words, the municipal government's average annual interest rate for using the bond proceeds is also 0.070668. However, if Lih An &amp; Co. sells the bonds at 85% of the face value, the average annual interest rate for investors would be 0.09589. Although some domestic bonds have been issued at full price or at 98% of the face value, the highest opening price on the market is only around 70% to 80%. Recently, it has fallen to only 40% to 50%. According to the market price, the interest rate is already more than 1% per month. Therefore, the interest rate for this issuance of public bonds cannot be too low. However, calculated at the above average annual interest rate, it is already much lower than various other bonds. (6) The city is issuing public bonds this time because citizens lack the ability to subscribe after the devastation of the war. Therefore, we are not soliciting subscriptions from citizens. This point was discussed in detail in the previous statement. As for the domestic banking sector, it was also reported by the Central News Agency that due to the severe financial constraints after the war, there was no surplus capacity to underwrite these public bonds. Therefore, we negotiated with foreign merchants to underwrite the bonds, which is essentially indirectly utilizing foreign capital. Although the use of foreign capital to handle municipal affairs is not common in China, there are many precedents in other countries. Before World War I, Japan issued bonds to Europe and the United States to alleviate financial difficulties and reconstruct Tokyo after the earthquake. Furthermore, many state-owned enterprises used foreign capital. Before World War I, the United States built railways with funds from Britain. Japan invested in South Manchuria and obtained special rights, mostly funded by Britain and the United States. Currently, Taiwan borrowed tens of millions of dollars from the New York copper syndicate Morgan &amp; Co. to develop its electricity industry. These are just a few examples.</p>
<h3>Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Decides to</h3>
<p>Form a Debt Restructuring Committee</p>
<p>Promote Qian Xinzhi and Li Fuxun to Draft the Charter</p>
<p>American Merchants Send Another Letter Continuing Their Protest</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held its second meeting to discuss the restructuring steps. It was decided to form a "Debt Restructuring Committee" and promote Directors Qian Xinzhi and Li Fuxun to draft the organizational charter. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Board of Directors Meeting Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the second Board of Directors meeting was held. Shi Liangcai, Zhang Shouyong, Ye Zhuotang, Yang Zhixiong, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Guangfu, Hu Bijang, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Sheng Lanchen, General Manager Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Gongquan, and others attended. Wang Xiaolai and Yu Rizhang were absent due to other commitments. Director Zhang Shouyong was elected chairman. First, General Manager Liu reported on the negotiations to recover the four wharves and dispatched personnel to maintain the current situation. Next, the board discussed the company's restructuring steps. All directors agreed that this matter was of great importance and decided to form a "China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Debt Restructuring Committee." Directors Qian Xinzhi and Li Fuxun were elected to draft the organizational charter in advance, which will be approved at the third Board of Directors meeting to ensure its early establishment. Afterwards, other important matters were discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Shi Liangcai's Statement Standing Director Shi Liangcai told a Central News Agency reporter that the acquisition of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's shares and the mortgage of the three wharves are matters related to the government after the company was brought under state ownership. The Ministry of Communications will be in charge, so the Board of Directors has not discussed it. As for the company's recovery of the three wharves from the American-owned China 영업 Co., the company has raised protests, and the Western press in Shanghai has criticized the company for not understanding the truth and for monitoring Li Guojie without submitting him to the court for investigation, which seems to be contrary to the rule of law. In fact, Li Guojie's temporary monitoring will only last until the government decides on a solution, whether to hand him over to the court for trial or to be handled by the government. The takeover of the three wharves was to prevent accidents involving all the workers. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had previously borrowed 5 million taels from HSBC Bank and owed more than 2 million taels in salt tax interest and subsidies, totaling more than 7 million taels, which urgently needed to be repaid. Therefore, HSBC Bank, as the first creditor, had a claim on the wharves. If the 10 million taels mortgage from the China 영업 Co. were added, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would have been completely bankrupt. The vast majority of coolies and laborers who depend on it for a living would have lost their jobs, and China's shipping industry would have been completely ruined. Therefore, this decisive action was taken out of necessity.</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng's Statement General Manager Liu Hongsheng told a New Voice News reporter that yesterday's report stating that his office was illegally seized was a misunderstanding. He only acknowledges this mortgage procedure if it is legal. Legality, in commercial terms, means that it should be approved by the shareholders' meeting. In political terms, such a major event should be approved by the Executive Yuan. Whether the mortgage of the four wharves has gone through this procedure is worth investigating.</p>
<p>Takeover Not Yet Completed Although the Board of Directors has taken over the company, the various documents have not yet been finalized. A detailed inventory will be taken after meeting with Li Guojie. The Industrial Property Section has not been fully taken over due to its close relationship with the Jiyu Real Estate Company. As for the Supervisory Committee, it has started working at the old site of the Supervisory Office, and the Board of Directors has started working at the old site of the former Board of Directors.</p>
<p>American Merchants Protest Yesterday, the company continued to receive protest letters from the American-owned China 영업 Co., continuing to state that they are not giving up their rights under the contract and urging the company to send someone to take responsibility and negotiate various procedures or settle the case. It is reported that the Board of Directors discussed this case yesterday and decided to submit it to the Ministry for instructions on how to handle it.</p>

<h3>The Post-War Relief Committee Begins Lending Capital to the Poor</h3>
<p>It Will Take About Four Days to Complete</p>
<p>Total Amount is 15,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Post-War Relief Committee, in order to restore the prosperity of the war-torn areas and to help the affected poor households to rebuild their businesses, has established a temporary lending office in Minli Road, Zhabei, and has established branches in six rural areas, including Jiangwan, Wusong, Zhenru, Pengpu, Yinxing, and Yinxiang, to handle various lending and borrowing matters. Since registration began, more than 300 poor households have borrowed capital. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the first batch of capital was lent to the poor.</p>
<p>Lending Measures The temporary relief lending measures are divided into (A) housing loans, (B) capital for the poor, (C) capital for small industries, and (D) repair loans for charitable organizations. As for the repayment period, the capital for the poor has a term of one year, housing loans and capital for small industries have a term of four years, and repair loans for charitable organizations have a term of six years.

<h3>Disaster Relief Committee Surveys the Yangtze River's New Embankment</h3>
<p>▲Invites Chinese and Foreign Celebrities▲ The Emei Steamer ▲Scheduled to Depart from Shanghai▲</p>
<p>Last year's flood disaster caused most of the Yangtze River embankments to be destroyed. The National Government's Flood Relief Committee was established and decided to use the "work-for-relief" method, using American wheat to build river embankments. The lower reaches start from Shierxu and the upper reaches end at Shashi, extending for more than 6,000 miles, employing 600,000 disaster workers and setting up ten offices. The construction of new embankments began in October last year and has now been completed. The unfinished projects of the Flood Relief Committee are now being taken over by the National Economic Council. Fourteen work-for-relief bureaus have been closed one after another, and four bureaus, including the Jianghan Bureau and the Jiangxi Bureau, are still remaining. The remaining funds from the relief wheat are now being used for dredging the Huai River's outer river and repairing embankments. The Flood Relief Committee believes that the new river embankment has been completed, so that even if the river water rises</p>

<p>to forty feet, it will still not overflow and destroy the embankment. Tens of thousands of acres of farmland near the embankment in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces will become fertile land in the future. The annual grain and agricultural products can be increased by tens of millions of yuan compared to the previous year, which can directly increase the wealth of the people and indirectly reduce bandits. The committee specially invited important figures from all walks of life in Shanghai to inspect the Yangtze River and inspect the current situation of the Yangtze River in order to plan further construction. The committee invited ten Westerners and forty celebrities from all walks of life in China, as well as the heads of the construction departments of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces, and Xin Bosheng and others, to go together. Yesterday, the committee specially chartered the Emei steamer from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to carry Chinese and foreign guests to inspect the Yangtze River embankment project. The round trip is scheduled for three weeks. The Emei steamer is specially undergoing repairs at the factory and is scheduled to depart on the 26th, starting from the Shierxu section and ending at Shashi. After the inspection is completed, the steamer will return to Shanghai. The invitation cards have been issued.</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression Headquarters</h3>
<p>Reviews the Additional Disaster Relief Donations on Road and Telegraph Fees</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Replies to the Three Provinces' Relief Association by Telegram</p>
<p>Has Telegraphed to the Executive Yuan to Instruct Relevant Departments to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Provisional Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei telegraphed General Commander Chiang on the 25th of last month, requesting him to find a way to add disaster relief donations to the road and telegraph fees. Yesterday, it received Chiang's reply by telegram. There have been many requests for disaster relief from various places. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Additional Disaster Relief Donations on Road and Telegraph Fees The association received a reply by telegram from General Commander Chiang of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, saying: "I have received and respectfully read the telegraph. The recovered bandit areas in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui are in urgent need of relief. The government's proposal to add disaster relief donations to the road and telegraph fees is an essential measure. This headquarters has reviewed the various sections opened in the original telegraph and telegraphed to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications to comply. I am attaching a copy of the original telegram for your information. Chiang Kai-shek [seal]" A copy of the original telegram from this headquarters to the Executive Yuan is attached. "To President Song of the Executive Yuan: According to a telegraph from Xu Minying, Vice Chairman Wang Zhen, Wang Xiaolai, and others of the Shanghai Provisional Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, the recovered bandit areas in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui are in urgent need of relief. They proposed to add disaster relief donations to the road and telegraph fees. After reviewing the various proposed methods separately, this department has determined the following: (1) The original telegram requested that disaster relief donations be added to long-distance passenger tickets on national railways, with 40 cents for first class, 20 cents for second class, and 10 cents for first class. It is proposed to follow the plan for first class, change the first class to 30 cents, and change the third class to 5 cents. The economic strength of third-class passengers is weaker, and ticket prices have been increased repeatedly in recent years. Calculated as a percentage, the increase is already higher than that of first and second classes, so it is not appropriate to add more. (2) The original telegram requested that disaster relief donations be added to freight transport on the Pinghan Railway, with 5% for salt and coal and 2.1% for other goods. It is found that freight transport on the Pinghan Railway is now dispersed by the Longhai Line and Huaiyun, and the commerce of Hankou is depressed. This is also one of the reasons, so it is not appropriate to increase freight rates again and hinder freight transport. Moreover, to develop the rural economy of Henan and Hubei, it is necessary to reduce freight rates and facilitate trade. This item should not be discussed. (3) The original telegram requested that disaster relief donations be added to telegrams, regardless of wired or wireless or distance, with 5 cents added to each telegram. It is found that adding donations to telegrams has little relationship with the livelihood of the people, so it seems possible to follow the plan. (4) The original telegram requested that the effective period for adding disaster relief donations be limited to six months. It is found that the planned period of six months is not too long, so it seems possible to follow the plan. However, it should be stated that it should be revoked immediately after the deadline. The above-discussed methods are enclosed with the original telegram and submitted to your esteemed yuan for review and to instruct the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications to comply. Chiang Kai-shek [seal]"</p>
<p>Anhui Organizes Relief Group The association received an official letter from Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, saying: "We have approved your letter instructing us to appoint local impartial gentry, merchants, and enthusiastic people to organize a relief group. We have submitted it to the committee's talks, and it was decided that the fundraising group should be established as soon as possible. The people's department will draw up the charter and submit it for approval. We have instructed the relevant departments to comply and request your review. "</p>
<p>Henan Relief Council Asks for Relief Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Relief Council, telegraphed: "It has been approved that the Henan Provincial Government's letter opens, it has been approved that General Commander Chiang's secret telegram opens, and it has been learned that Xu, Commissioner of the Ninth District of Henan, telegraphed that the refugees in Xinji have no food and no shelter and are in urgent need of relief. In addition to submitting the report, we respectfully submit this telegram and request a large sum of relief money quickly." In addition, the Henan Provincial Government replied, stating that they have approved the instructions to appoint local impartial silk merchants to jointly initiate the organization of a fundraising group and have instructed the provincial relief council to handle it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Party Department of the Division Asks for Relief A telegram from the Special Party Department of the 32nd Division of the Army stated: "We respectfully represent the 200,000 disaster victims in Zhongshan and sincerely appeal to you to open your purses and save them in order to save the remnants of the disaster."</p>
<p>Meeting to be Called Tomorrow The association sent letters to the inspection teams and preparatory committee members, saying: "We respectfully inform you that on the 15th of this month, representatives of various groups at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce discussed the organizational charter of the inspection team for the disaster areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei and decided to pass it with revisions. The following three proposals were also decided: (1) The minimum amount of the first disaster relief fund for the three provinces is tentatively set at 150,000 yuan. (2) The government is requested to allocate relief funds first for disaster relief by this association (3) The preparatory committee is notified to inform the legal groups to recommend one to three representatives as members of the inspection team within one week, etc. We have set the second preparatory committee meeting for 4:00 PM on the 18th of this month (Friday) at the Renji Pawnshop, where this association is located. There are important motions that need to be discussed and decided. We have enclosed the revised organizational charter and sent this letter for your attention. We respectfully request that you attend the meeting at the time."</p>

<h3>Typhoon Destroys Dongsha Island Lighthouse</h3>
<p>Attention Mariners</p>
<p>Typhoons have struck Luzon, Taiwan, and eastern Japan, causing extensive damage. The South China Sea has also been affected. It is reported that Dongsha Island, located near 116 degrees 43 minutes East longitude and 23 degrees 21 minutes North latitude, was hit by a severe typhoon and massive waves. A lighthouse built by the Coast Guard was struck by the high winds and waves and has been destroyed. The light on the tower is no longer functioning as a navigational aid. Upon learning of the incident, the Coast Guard immediately received a wireless report and has dispatched a large number of workers for repairs.

<h3>British House of Commons</h3>
<p>Discussion on Shanghai Special District Court Issue</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 15th reports that the issue of the Shanghai Special District Court was recently raised in the House of Commons and was discussed again today in the House of Lords. Earl Peel read a motion, requesting attention to the agreement establishing the court and inquiring what steps the government is currently taking to revise the agreement. Peel continued, stating that external parties have expressed the opinion that the current motion is inappropriate, and therefore he wishes to postpone the discussion. Secretary of State for War, Lord Hailsham, stated that the government is very grateful for Earl Peel's consideration. The government's reason for advocating postponement is that the developments in the Shanghai incident are not yet conclusive, and it cannot be determined whether discussing the matter would be beneficial to the public interest.</p>
<h3>Local Ningbo Residents Express Dissent Regarding Liu Shi's Troop Deployment to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Since the news of Liu Zhennian's troops being deployed to eastern Zhejiang spread, it has caused panic among the people of Ningbo. It is generally believed that eastern Zhejiang is still peaceful, especially the Ningbo area, and there is no need to station heavy troops there. Various business groups in Ningbo will jointly telegraph Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting him to order the troops to be deployed elsewhere to reassure the local population. They are also asking Ningbo natives residing in Shanghai to jointly appeal. It is reported that prominent Ningbo figures in Shanghai have received letters and telegrams from their hometown, requesting them to advocate for a unified stance. A meeting will be convened in the coming days to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Representative Discusses the Movement of the Guizhou Army and Chiang's Division</h3>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, Jiang Zaizhen's division of the Guizhou Army has recently experienced sudden movements and has been surrounded by troops dispatched by Wang Jialie, the chairman of the province. A reporter from the East China News Agency yesterday interviewed Mr. Xu, a representative of the Guizhou provincial government, to inquire about the details. According to Xu, Jiang Zaizhen's division, currently stationed in Zunyi, has been recruiting bandits, intercepting tax revenues, and allowing its subordinates to extort money at will. Recently, it has also been spreading rumors to confuse public opinion. Furthermore, on the seventh day of this month, the division suddenly dispatched a regiment to deploy military forces on the north bank of the Wu River, cutting off transportation. Its elite troops, led by Yuan Binglin, also rushed to Yachi River and other places in Qianxi County to shell Song's troops stationed there, intending to occupy the counties of Qianxi and seize tax revenues, thereby cutting off Guiyang's economic lifeline. After receiving the report, Chairman Wang Jialie, considering that Jiang's troops were acting as rebels and undermining unity during this time of national crisis, convened a meeting of important generals in Guiyang. As a result of the discussion, they agreed to disarm Jiang Zaizhen's troops by force to prevent further chaos. On New Year's Day, they ordered Brigadier General Jian Wenbo to lead four regiments from Guiyang, and also ordered You Guocai's division stationed in Anshun and Che Mingyi's division stationed in Tongren to each dispatch two regiments to advance towards Zunyi in separate directions, forming an encirclement to resolve the issue of Jiang Zaizhen's troops. It is verified that although the division is nominally a division, it only has two infantry regiments. It is expected that the entire force can be subdued within ten days.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Statement on Telephone Rate Hike</h3>
<p>The atmosphere of Shanghai citizens opposing the telephone rate hike had once subsided, but recently the Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association and the First District Citizens' Association are still working hard on this issue. In addition to sending letters to relevant local organizations, they have also sent telegrams to various ministries of the Nanjing government. Yesterday, the association received reply telegrams from the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others. The telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is as follows: "To the Shanghai Special District Citizens' United First District Branch and the Nanjing Road Business Community Association: Your telegram is acknowledged. If the matter of the Shanghai concession's telephone rate increase is as stated in your telegram, then the company's actions are indeed inappropriate and should be corrected to alleviate the burden on citizens. We have forwarded the situation to the Shanghai Municipal Government for investigation and handling. Sincerely, Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</p>
<p>The association also sent letters to the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Municipal Council yesterday. The original texts are included below: (To the Chinese Ratepayers Association): "Respectfully, we have recently received reports from our members Sanxing Factory (telephone 94834), Hefeng (94944), Ren Changtai (94798), Maoshenghe (94717), Changfeng (94683), etc., stating that the telephone service of these companies has been disconnected by the Shanghai Telephone Company on November 13, either because they had already paid the original price for the autumn and winter quarters or because they were waiting for the resolution of the rate increase negotiations. We request that your association strive for a resolution. In this regard, our association, representing the majority of its members, believes that the massive price increase should not be imposed abruptly. We have listed our reasons and sent a letter to your association requesting you to strive for a reasonable resolution. Our association hopes that the company will cancel the compensation for the new price and set a fair price instead, which is a compromise that takes both sides into consideration. We originally hoped that the dispute would be resolved quickly. However, the company disregarded this intention and took unreasonable measures, claiming that it had obtained the approval of the Municipal Council, and therefore dared to oppress users and do whatever it wanted, regardless of everything. Furthermore, it has already accepted the old price. Cutting off the lines of users who have already paid for the autumn and winter quarters is even more of a fraudulent act and violates commercial ethics. If this situation continues, there will be no good outcome. If a fire breaks out in a disconnected user's premises during this period, and they suffer unlimited losses because they cannot use the telephone, resulting in an unsafe situation, who will be responsible? This matter concerns social security and public transportation. We are writing to you again, respectfully requesting your association to investigate and provide a swift remedy, expressing our friendship." (To the Municipal Council): "Respectfully, we have recently received reports from our members, the Shanghai Telephone Company's users Sanxing Factory (telephone 94834), Hefeng (94944), Ren Changtai (94798), Maoshenghe (94717), Changfeng (94683), etc., stating that the telephone service of these companies has been disconnected by the Shanghai Telephone Company on November 13, either because they had already paid the original price for the autumn and winter quarters or because they were waiting for the resolution of the rate increase negotiations. We request that your department strive for a resolution. In this regard, our association, representing the majority of its members, believes that the massive price increase should not be imposed abruptly. We have listed our reasons and sent a letter to your department requesting you to accommodate public opinion. Our association hopes that the company will cancel the compensation for the new price and set a fair price instead, which is a compromise that takes both sides into consideration. We originally hoped that the dispute would be resolved quickly. However, the company disregarded this intention and took unreasonable measures, claiming that it had obtained the approval of your bureau, and therefore dared to oppress users and do whatever it wanted, regardless of everything. Furthermore, it has already accepted the old price. Cutting off the lines of users who have already paid for the autumn and winter quarters is even more of a fraudulent act and violates commercial ethics. We fear that if this situation continues, there will be no good outcome. If a fire breaks out in a disconnected user's premises during this period, and they suffer unlimited losses because they cannot use the telephone, resulting in an unsafe situation, who will be responsible? We are writing to you again, requesting your bureau to accept the public opinion of the majority of Chinese citizens, and quickly approve the requests in our previous letter, ordering the Shanghai Telephone Company to set a new, fair price, and immediately stop the practice of disconnecting lines, in order to facilitate public transportation and maintain social security, expressing our sincere friendship."</p>

The association expressed its deep sympathy and should adhere to the principle of mutual assistance, doing its best to assist the Vietnamese overseas Chinese in resolving their vital interests and completing the unfinished tasks of the representatives Huang and Ji.

<h3>Suspecting Wife of Infidelity, Man Throws Infant to Death</h3>
<p>Yu Longquan Listens to Friends' Rumors, Pitiful Girl Dies Wrongfully</p>
<p>Yu Longquan, the 25-year-old son of villager Yu Shenghe from No. 93, West Sanli Bridge, Pudong, is a plasterer. He married Zhao, who is 21 years old. They have been married for four years, but the relationship between the couple is very bad, and they often quarrel. This year, Zhao became pregnant. Yu Longquan heard rumors from his bad friend Ma Ligen, saying that Zhao had had an affair. Yu Longquan often argued that his wife's pregnancy was not his doing. Until last month, Zhao gave birth to a daughter. Yu Longquan was not at home. When he returned home the other day, he saw the child who was less than a month old and couldn't help but feel resentment. He immediately picked up the child and threw her to death. When he saw that the child was dead, he immediately fled. Yu Shenghe reported the news to the Third District, Third Precinct. In addition to detaining Yu Longquan for investigation, he ordered the local bailiff to report the case to the local court for examination yesterday.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Municipal Police Department's Detention of Military Equipment Samples</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Military Affairs previously learned of new military equipment recently invented in France. Therefore, it entrusted the Shanghai firm of Lihai &amp; Co. to transport several samples of new anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, etc., to Nanjing for inspection. The ministry issued passes along the way as proof. Fu Xi, a Sichuan military officer, learned that the new military equipment was excellent and telegraphed the Shanghai firm of Xianghe &amp; Co., requesting to transport it to Sichuan for inspection after the military inspected it. Therefore, the merchant shipped it from Nanjing to Sichuan the other day and loaded it on the Yongfeng Wheel the night before last to return to Shanghai. When it arrived in Shanghai, it was discovered by the special team of the Municipal Police Department that the number of pieces of military equipment did not match the number of pieces stated on the passport issued by the Ministry of Military Affairs. The military equipment was all detained. Yesterday, after learning of this, the merchant sent a representative to the Municipal Government to request its return. The negotiations are still in progress.</p>
<h3>French Envoy Visits Mayor Wu</h3>

<h3>Court Researching Case of Sealing Up Beixin Bookstore, Following Procedures</h3>
<p>Has Not Yet Notified the Police, Not Refusal to Execute. A newspaper reported yesterday that the police refused to seal up the Beixin Bookstore. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the court is definitely following legal procedures to handle the case, and it has only had a joint research discussion with the police department. There has been no notification to execute the sealing.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun Speaks. According to Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, the Municipal Government has not received formal notification about the police refusing to seal up the Beixin Bookstore. He is not certain about the details, so the Municipal Government is not in a position to comment. This matter is being handled under orders from the Central Government, and everything is being done according to the Central Government's instructions. In his personal opinion, whether or not the Beixin Bookstore has insulted Islam and whether or not its content constitutes criminal defamation are the prerequisites for the case. He understands that the Islamic Association has also requested Director-General Fessenden of the Ding Municipal Council to seal the store. It is unknown whether or not he has accepted the request. In light of the book industry's petition to withdraw the order, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has submitted a letter of request. However, the Municipal Government has simply forwarded the letter to the Central Government.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Proclamation. The Shanghai Municipal Government also issued a proclamation stating: "Proclamation regarding the incident. The Executive Yuan orders that ethnic equality and freedom of religion are the basic political tenets of our nation. The National Government, based on these tenets, has always supported all ethnic groups and religions in the country and has spared no effort. The Islamic people are an important component of the Republic of China and have made outstanding contributions to the party and the country, and have always been loved and respected by the whole country. However, it has been found that Beixin Bookstore, Nanhua Literary Society, and others have distributed insulting and malicious words against Islam, which is extremely absurd. Although the incident is minor, there is deep concern that distant rumors will cause misunderstandings. It has been ordered that the responsible agencies be severely dealt with according to law, to serve as a warning. In the future, all publications must not contain any form of contempt for any religion. In addition to the Government enforcing the law, it is hoped that all parties will be aware of the need to love and respect others, to discard differences and seek common ground. At this time of national crisis, it is especially important to strengthen unity and avoid causing incidents over minor matters. Let us all strive together. This is hereby proclaimed for general knowledge."</p>
<h3>Lu Feibo Discusses the Beixin Bookstore Case</h3>
<p>Only Seeking to Handle According to the Law, Not Protecting Beixin</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited Mr. Lu Feibo to inquire about the dispute between Islam and Beixin. Mr. Lu received the reporter and was asked whether the Islamic side had responded after the advertisement was published. Mr. Lu replied that he did not initially know that the Islamic community had established the United Association of Shanghai Mosques to handle the Beixin case, with an office in the Zhejiang Road Mosque. It was not until he met a member of the Islamic community, Mr. Huang, that he learned about it. Therefore, he went to the office at 11:00 AM this morning and was received by the Imam of the mosque, Mr. Ha Junde. Mr. Ha was very kind and said that the matter concerned the entire Islamic community and that he personally could not make any claims. He requested that a formal letter be sent to the association for consideration. After a brief discussion, he happily took his leave. However, at 3:00 PM, just as he was about to send the letter, he suddenly received a notification from Mr. Ha asking him not to send the letter, presumably because the opinions of the Islamic community were not yet unified. Mr. Lu also said that the insulting words against Islam in Beixin's publications were indeed unbearable. Not only the Islamic community hated it, but also many people in the book industry believed that such publications were a disgrace to the publishing industry. Recently, many people have sent letters to the Book Industry Association, questioning this matter. However, the Book Industry Association has no power to ban it. Beixin's offense against Islam is indeed deserved. Those in the industry who understand the situation will definitely not want to protect it in the slightest. Therefore, Beixin appealed to the industry association for assistance at the beginning of the incident, but the association refused because Beixin was to blame for its own troubles and did not want to be involved. Now, because of the administrative punishment and the change in the law, the impact is unimaginable. At this point, he could no longer stand by and watch, so he published the advertisement, hoping to negotiate a remedy with the Islamic representatives. This move was not only for the benefit of the entire publishing industry but also for the legal protection of the people of the whole country. Once this precedent is set, everyone will be in danger. He did not have the slightest intention to protect Beixin, and he hoped that the Islamic community would understand this. As for the word "mediation" in the advertisement, it was only intended to contact the Islamic community for consultations on remedies. As for the three proposed plans, they were all temporary assumptions and not fixed conditions. The Islamic community could exchange opinions during the face-to-face meeting. In short, if the Beixin case is handled according to the law, the Book Industry Association will have no objection, regardless of the outcome being unfavorable to Beixin. However, to seal the store without legal procedures is something that not only people in the industry will disagree with. The reporter then asked if the police had refused to carry out the order, as reported in the newspaper. Mr. Lu replied that he did not know and stated that the book industry had not applied to the Municipal Council. This matter concerns national dignity, and the book industry will definitely not do such a thing. The reason why he wanted to contact the Islamic community was not only for the benefit of the future of the book industry, but also to preserve the national dignity and the dignity of Islam. The reporter then asked about the rumor that the book industry would go on strike to protest. Mr. Lu declared emphatically that there would be no such action.</p>

<h3>Westerner Fined for Indiscriminate Shooting</h3>

He was warned that it was extremely foolish to discharge firearms in Chinese territory and was given a lenient punishment with the hope that he would not repeat the offense in the future. According to details of the case, a policeman from the Public Safety Bureau testified in court yesterday that he and two other policemen were patrolling the road on Sunday evening when they suddenly heard several gunshots coming from the east. They investigated to the front of the cement factory, where they saw a crowd gathered. Upon inquiry, they learned that a Westerner had been shooting indiscriminately. They searched the vicinity but found nothing. About ten minutes later, the defendant drove by in a car. Bystanders identified him as the Westerner who had fired the gun, so he was taken to the Public Safety Bureau and handed over to the authorities in the International Settlement. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he was shooting at the ground and did not endanger the public. The judge imposed a lenient fine and released him with a warning.</p>

<h3>Good News Extended During the Commemoration of Tongchang's Anniversary</h3>

<h3>Pudong Ferry Households</h3>
<p>Request to Designate a Permanent Ferry Dock. Lu Baokui and others from the Pudong Lannidu Ferry Business Office submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Government stating: "Submitting a document because the ferry dock has been abolished, livelihoods have been cut off, please designate a permanent ferry dock to provide relief and pacify the people. We, Baokui and 37 other households, are ferry operators in Lannidu, Pudong, generation after generation, relying on it to make a living. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities converted the Dongchang Wharf into a ferry, although the municipal government stated that the original ferry service operated by Baokui and others would still be allowed to continue operating, and the central ferry would be between Dongmen Road and Dongchang Road, and the ferry service of Baokui and others would be between Jiangtian Wharf and Lannidu, different routes, each unrelated. Even if other ferry terminals are established in the future, it is planned to reserve space for them to use. The documents are all there, showing the utmost concern of the municipal government for maintaining the livelihood of the people. However, recently, rumors spread that as a result of negotiations between the Bureau of Public Utilities and Huatong Zhan and Hongsheng Wharf, there would be a four-zhang-wide area north and south for the expansion of Dongchang Wharf. The implementation of a single ferry has already been decided, but the original ferry dock in Lannidu will be abolished, affecting not only the inability of Baokui and others to use the ferry, but also the inconvenience of commercial transportation and loading and unloading of goods. This is not a good plan. If it is implemented, Baokui and others will have no place to stand, and it will not be in accordance with the original intention of the previous municipal government's repeated statements. After repeated consideration, in order to ensure the safety of the ferry, we request that the municipal government investigate and stipulate that the current Lannidu Wharf or other suitable locations far from the municipal ferry be used as a permanent ferry dock. We believe that the livelihoods of dozens of families of Baokui and others are all due to the relief efforts of the municipal government, and we still earnestly request continuous maintenance and a swift designation of a permanent ferry dock, so that in the midst of vigorous construction, the intention of benefiting the people will not be lost. We are extremely apprehensive and await orders."</p>

After the formalities were completed, Chairman Pan Tang Guanyu reported, stating in brief, "After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the members of various committees dispersed and there was a lack of responsible personnel, which hindered the association's affairs. Although the war has subsided, the movement to advocate national goods should not be relaxed for a day, especially in our women's circles. Advocating national goods is the most effective weapon to defend against insults and save the country. This is why the association is in urgent need of reorganization. Currently, the association's premises are temporarily borrowed from No. 542 Zhonghua Road, which is only a temporary accommodation and not a permanent location.

<h3>Young Master Kidnaps His Own Son</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Yesterday, I Saw in the Newspaper That Huang Zhengqing, a Young Master From Jin Yuan Money Bank in Zhenjiang, Lost More Than 10,000 Gold in Gambling and Could Not Think of a Way Out; He Ordered His Wet Nurse to Hide His Two-Year-Old Son and Falsely Accused His Father of Being Kidnapped by Bandits; In the End, Because the Procedures Were Not Complete, the Matter Was Exposed;</p>
<p>Kidnapping Cases Have Been Quite Popular Lately, and There Are Even Those Who Kidnap Friends, Relatives, and Employers, But Kidnapping One's Own Son Is the First Time I Have Heard of It; Huang Zhengqing Lost a Huge Sum of Money Due to Gambling and Could Not Think of a Solution, So He Kidnapped His Own Son for Ransom to Defraud His Father of Money; This Directly Kidnaps His Son's Ticket, but Indirectly Kidnaps His Father's Ticket; He Commits Both Gambling and Banditry Crimes, Which Are Extremely Evil; Old Huang's Beard Is Rising;</p>
<p>Recently, People's Hearts Have Changed Greatly; Sons Can Kidnap Fathers, and Fathers Can Kidnap Sons; That Is, in Kidnapping Cases, the Patterns Have Been Innovated and Are Full of Wonders; In Fact, Kidnapping Is Just an Abstract Noun; All Kinds of Illegal Means Are Used to Force Others to Give Money, or to Use Power to Make People Subordinate Unreasonably and Unable to Resist; None of Them Are Behaviors of a Kidnapping Nature; However, the Kidnapping of Kidnappers Still Has Facts to Prove and the Law Can Punish, While the Kidnapping of Non-Kidnappers Is Truly Impossible to Control; I Can Only Recite the Words of a Few Old Seniors:</p>
<p>People's Hearts Are Not as Good as in Ancient Times;</p>

<h3>An Elegy on the Investigation and Burial of Starved Corpses in Linxia</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from a friend in Gansu, accompanied by an elegy by Deng Deyi on the investigation and burial of starved corpses in Linxia. It is so tragic that I transcribe it below to inform the readers:</p>
<p>My village suffers from the scourge of war,</p>
<p>The common people are mostly scattered.</p>
<p>Repeated pacifications and rebellions,</p>
<p>Hunger and cold are not easily avoided.</p>
<p>Remaining lives are left in ditches,</p>
<p>Barely prolonging their lingering breaths.</p>
<p>I sigh for the families of eight,</p>
<p>Most are barefoot.</p>
<p>If only they have enough grain inside,</p>
<p>Why bother distinguishing beans from wheat?</p>
<p>If only good rain comes,</p>
<p>Why worry about the weather being parched?</p>
<p>They deeply receive the grace of the great government,</p>
<p>But resent Yao and Tan being shallow.</p>
<p>I come to aid the displaced and deceased,</p>
<p>My heart is long, but my strength is short.</p>
<p>Cold leftovers and residual soup,</p>
<p>Are difficult to distribute to each bowl.</p>
<p>Inspecting the people's pallid faces,</p>
<p>Empty stomachs rumble like a pulley.</p>
<p>Emaciated faces are yellow and scorched,</p>
<p>Limbs of the dead are severed.</p>
<p>Flies and maggots suck blood and fat,</p>
<p>Dogs and pigs gnaw at hair braids.</p>
<p>New ghosts cry and say,</p>
<p>When will the armor be washed?</p>
<p>Old ghosts murmur and sigh,</p>
<p>Whose talent will be displayed?</p>
<p>Wanting to preserve their lives,</p>
<p>They bitterly twist their lips and beards.</p>
<p>Alas, people displaced by turmoil,</p>
<p>Are like wandering, homeless dogs.</p>
<p>White bones pile up like mountains,</p>
<p>Memorial mounds seal the earth.</p>
<p>Moved by this, I compose a lament,</p>
<p>Tears flow secretly as the song is completed.</p>

<h3>Turning Old Cotton into New Cotton</h3>
<p>— Yi Wei</p>
<p>When cotton batting is used in clothes or bedding for a year or two, and the cotton fibers have not changed, it can be turned into new cotton with slight processing. It is not only soft, light, and warm, but also has excellent elasticity for dyeing.</p>
<p>(1) Tear the old cotton batting into small pieces, loosen it with a cotton gin (manual labor is also acceptable), and spray it with clean water.</p>
<p>(2) First boil an appropriate amount of clean water in a pot. Add caustic soda and dissolve it. Then, take the sprayed old cotton, put it into the pot, and boil it for three hours before捞起(lao qi). (When the steam rushes out of the pot, do not get your face too close.) Place it on a press to squeeze out the dark water, put it in a bamboo basket, wash it clean with clean water, and squeeze it dry.</p>
<p>(3) Use two wooden buckets, A and B. Drill a small hole in the bottom edge of bucket B. On the inside of the hole, nail a layer of fine lead wire mesh. Plug the hole with a wooden stopper. Pour bleaching powder into bucket A, dissolve it with a small amount of clean water, add more water, and stir well. Cover it and let it sit for four hours, without letting the gas escape. Connect bucket B to the leaking hole of bucket A. Remove the wooden stopper from bucket A, allowing the clarified bleaching powder water to leak into bucket B. Then pour it into a vat, add clean water, and stir (use cold water in summer and hot water in winter). Put the washed cotton into the bleaching powder water and stir well. Cover it tightly (do not let the gas escape, to prevent ineffective bleaching), soak it for twelve hours, take it out, wash it clean, and squeeze it dry.</p>
<p>(4) Put sulfuric acid into a clean water vat to make dilute sulfuric acid water. Put the bleached cotton into it and expose it for two hours. Take it out, wash it clean, and squeeze it dry.</p>
<p>(5) Put edible salt and alum into a clean water vat. Put the washed and squeezed cotton into it and submerge it for one hour. Take it out, wash it clean, squeeze it dry, and dry it in the sun. Loosen it with a cotton gin, or manually, and it becomes superior white cotton, even better than new cotton.</p>
<p>Recipe:</p>
<p>Old cotton: 30 catties</p>
<p>Edible salt (ground into powder): 5 taels</p>
<p>Bleaching Powder: 3 catties and 4 taels</p>
<p>Caustic Soda: 4 and a half catties</p>
<p>Alums: 6 taels</p>
<p>Sulluric Acid: 1 catty and 1 tael</p>

<h3>The Mysterious Love Letter</h3>
<p>— A Yang</p>
<p>At X Girls' School, letters must be reviewed by a review committee organized by each grade before being distributed to individuals. This greatly hinders those who have love letters to exchange. Some clever individuals employ various means of networking, lobbying, and entertaining to ensure their letters pass safely. Others take the opportunity to blackmail or even openly announce the contents of the letters, leading to frequent jokes.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Ms. K has a lover, but no one has ever found a love letter from him. Although she receives letters with red and green envelopes bearing her name every week, their contents are only a few short sentences or a poem-like text. Outsiders cannot fathom the situation. Indeed, some irrelevant descriptions are often found between the lines, which surprises the reviewers. As a result, not only has Ms. K become the subject of mysterious suspicion, but the reviewers have also vowed to crack this strange case.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>, compelling the review committee members to dedicate themselves to this mystery.</p>
<p>Another date arrived. Among a pile of thought-provoking 件 (jian, documents), Ms. 女士 (nv shi)'s letter was discovered again, naturally focusing their attention on it. However, the review revealed that it was still similar to the previous two letters, only a poem-like text with disjointed sentences. The original letter was as follows:</p>
<p>The bright moon hangs serenely in the sky,</p>
<p>How clear and tranquil the heavens are!</p>
<p>Three or five stars twinkle and sway,</p>
<p>The time is already utterly quiet!</p>
<p>The French哑铃(ya ling) plays a melody of longing,</p>
<p>The nation's destiny is so full of misfortune!</p>
<p>A beautiful flower and full moon are no longer timely!</p>
<p>The garden is desolate and autumn grieves!</p>
<p>Waiting for 娜(na), the angel to descend,</p>
<p>Do you remember? Fine scenery and auspicious time.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang." With the undivided attention of all the reviewers, the secret was discovered. It turned out to be a mysterious love letter with a rendezvous, the sentences were barely pieced together, only the first character of each line was important, which was "Tomorrow at three, French Garden, waiting for you." With the truth revealed, everyone felt the novelty of the matter and admired Ms. K's lover's ingenuity. Instantly, the news spread throughout the school, and Ms. K blushed, surrounded by her classmates' laughter.</p>
<p>Behind the Scenes</p>
<h3>New Methods of Extortion</h3>
<p>— Li Huo</p>
<p>Zhang Jun, whom I hadn't seen for a long time, suddenly arrived at my humble abode yesterday, causing me unexpected joy. I hurriedly invited him into the house to discuss his current situation after our long separation. After some pleasantries, I learned from his conversation that Zhang Jun had recently opened a store in Hongkou, and the business was not bad. He also told me about a recent extortion incident, which I record here for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, I (Zhang Jun himself) came out of a relative's house and planned to take the No. 6 tram back to the store. As I was lingering at the tram stop, a young man suddenly appeared in my sight. He opened his mouth and said:</p>
<p>"Brother Zhang, how have you been lately? Where are you making a fortune? Brother has been in dire straits recently, to tell you the truth, so poor that I can't even afford three meals a day. I heard that you have been very successful recently, and your residence has recently been rented on Haining Road. Brother should have come to visit, but I am ashamed of my tattered clothes. It is fortunate that we met today. Last year, when you were in the village, you borrowed ten yuan from me, which has not been returned to this day. I suppose you have forgotten it because you are a busy person. Brother should not be so presumptuous as to urge you to repay this small sum, but because I am drifting at sea and have no means of income and no relatives to rely on, I have no choice but to shamelessly beg you. I hope my brother will not blame me!"</p>
<p>I was so confused by his flowery words that I couldn't make heads or tails of it. I had never met such a person before. When I tried to argue that he was mistaken, he insisted that we had gone to school together since childhood and that he was a relative. His surname was Wang, and his sister-in-law's aunt and my mother were blood sisters. In May of last year, I had asked him to buy ten yuan worth of clothing material in Shanghai. We used to visit each other often, but now that I am poor, I don't even recognize my friends anymore. Gentlemen, what kind of logic is that! Many bystanders felt that his reasons were sufficient and even produced my resume, mocking me for not treating my friends like that.</p>
<p>At that time, he was scolding me for no reason in front of everyone. Relying on his eloquence, he made me blush and left me speechless, with no room for argument. Later, someone came out to mediate and told me to give him one yuan to settle the matter. At that time, I was in a dilemma, so I had to admit my bad luck and gave him one yuan to get rid of him. After I inquired, I found out that there are indeed such rogues who specialize in extorting money from passengers at tram stations and transportation hubs. Those who are extorted have no way to argue. They specialize in inquiring about people's resumes. Once they find out, they can start their business. Those who are good at it can cheat more than a hundred yuan at a time. However, they also size up their victims. They would never patronize those who are old Shanghai residents. I advise all honest comrades not to fall into their trap.</p>

<h3>A New Interpretation of Code Words</h3>
<p>— Yun Zong</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialists are engaging in militarism, invading our territory, slaughtering our people, plundering our wealth, disregarding humanity, and ignoring justice, acting wantonly. They are truly 虧對頭寡婦 (kui dui tou gua fu) – losing out against the widow (unlawful and reckless)! "法 (fa, law)" is a mispronunciation of "髮 (fa, hair)."</p>
<p>During the Battle of Shanghai, the 19th Route Army resisted the Japanese to the death, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's advance. The world was shocked and admired their bravery. They are truly 高山上敲鑼 (gao shan shang qiao luo) – hitting a gong on a high mountain (famous in all directions)! "名 (ming, name)" is a homophone of "鳴 (ming, sound)."</p>
<p>Important figures in the Party, at a time when internal and external troubles are pressing, are still either visiting famous mountains and scenic spots or indulging in fine wine and beautiful women. They are truly 肉骨頭敲鼓 (rou gu tou qiao gu) – beating a drum with a meaty bone (昏𥋾𥋾 (hun dong dong) – muddled)! "葷鼕鼕 (hun dong dong)" is a homophone.</p>
<p>The nation is in dire straits, yet some military men and politicians still fight for power and profit, acting like overlords. They are truly 買了乾魚放生 (mai le gan yu fang sheng) – buying dried fish and releasing it (弗得知死活 (fu de zhi si huo) – not knowing whether to live or die)!</p>
<p>The armed class commits crimes and evils, but the government cannot punish them according to the law. They are truly 張天師被鬼迷 (zhang tian shi bei gui mi) – Zhang Tianshi being bewitched by a ghost (有法没用 (you fa mei yong) – having the law but not using it)!</p>
<p>Treacherous merchants sell enemy goods, only wanting to make money for themselves, regardless of whether the nation is doomed. They are truly 棺材裏伸手 (guan cai li shen shou) – reaching out from the coffin (死要錢 (si yao qian) – desperately wanting money)!</p>
<p>Casual Chat</p>
<h3>Shifting Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>I. Random Notes</p>
<p>We seek money to survive, but are seduced and bewildered by its power, causing us to fall and fail, ultimately losing our ability to survive.</p>
<p>The more civilized a place is in terms of material wealth and the more advanced it is in terms of scholarship, the more rampant evil grows. If you don't believe me, take a look at Shanghai! Adultery, theft, and murder fill the newspapers every day!</p>
<p>Everyone says that we should cast off hypocrisy in life, but life is ultimately inseparable from it. The greater the person, the greater the hypocrisy... Where is there a word of truth?</p>
<p>Venereal disease doctors seem to be practicing medicine to save the world and ferrying people across the sea of suffering, but in reality, something seems amiss. Because many people hold the preconceived notion of being prepared for any eventuality, the more venereal disease doctors there are, the more people suffer from venereal diseases.</p>
<p>II. What is Meant by Jointly Meeting the National Crisis?</p>
<p>A: What is meant by jointly meeting the national crisis?</p>
<p>B: It means jointly saving the nation from its crisis.</p>
<p>A: No, no, jointly meeting means jointly promoting. Promoting means accelerating. It means jointly accelerating the national crisis. Don't you see that several civil wars have broken out during this time of national crisis? Isn't that jointly accelerating the national crisis?</p>
<p>B: Yes, yes.</p>
<p>III. Two Radically Different Faces</p>
<p>When the manager speaks to the clerk, his face is very stern. At the same time, the clerk's face has no choice but to wear a pleasant expression. Radically different!</p>
<p>When the police officer raises his baton to hit the rickshaw puller, his face is very fierce. At the same time, the rickshaw puller's face is very frightened! Pitiful! Radically different!</p>
<p>When a beggar asks for money, his face is very sad. At the same time, the face he turns away has a very disgusted and angry expression. Radically different!</p>
<p>IV. The Most Patriotic People are Villagers</p>
<p>A friend said, "The most patriotic people are villagers."</p>
<p>I said, "How do you know?"</p>
<p>He replied, "Villagers' clothing, food, and shelter are all made of domestic goods! Whereas in the cities, the clothing, food, and shelter are mostly imported!"</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Humanity</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The humanitarian was sitting in a rickshaw. When he passed the Bund, he saw many coolies with disheveled hair and dirty faces painfully hauling goods with all their might, groaning and moaning. He felt very sad, and he couldn't help but feel heartbroken:</p>
<p>"Ah! This is simply a living hell, it is truly inhuman. But why do these coolies have to do this? Can't they find other jobs? Since they are human beings, why do they have to live like cattle and horses? Alas! They are truly a bunch of stupid pigs!" So his noble compassion inevitably turned to disdain for them. But then he thought, "But they are very pitiful after all, they can't eat their fill, they can't keep warm, everyone should sympathize with them. That's right, I should pity them, I can give them some copper coins, they will definitely be very grateful. Moreover, this is a very good opportunity for me to accumulate good karma. By doing this, my morality will certainly be elevated a lot.</p>
<p>So he displayed great compassion, and his tender, plump white hand reached into his pocket and took out a handful of copper coins, which he threw down from the rickshaw with a clatter. Of course, this group of hungry people would madly rush forward to pick up the coins. Those who picked them up wanted to pick up more, and those who didn't pick them up wanted to pick them up even more. Each copper coin was like their own life, fighting and grabbing, resulting in him snatching it from his hand, and him snatching it back from his hand. So they cursed, beat each other, rolled on the ground, and twisted around the wheels of the car. Some people even stepped over them, and soon their faces were covered in blood. At this time, the humanitarian felt very honored, "Oh, I have done a good deed." He couldn't help but jump out of the rickshaw, stick out his chest, walk forward, and shout in a loud voice: "Don't fight, why do you have to fight? I'll give you a few more."</p>
<p>Another clatter, another group of people rushed from all directions, again grabbing and snatching. Indeed, they were doing it for survival, for hunger, why shouldn't they do it?</p>
<p>Of course, our humanitarian felt even more "good karma," and a feeling of happiness welled up from his heart, followed by a burst of laughter. But he immediately encountered two angry gazes sweeping across his face, followed by a big man pointing at him and roaring:</p>
<p>"Are you laughing at us? Are you laughing at us fighting? Are you giving us a few copper coins to teach us to fight for you? Bastard!"</p>
<p>"Hey! I am kindly helping you, do you have to offend me?" he said resentfully. "They are truly a group of beasts who don't know gratitude!"</p>
<p>"Oh? You are helping us?" Another person said, "Thank you for your kindness, but why are you laughing at us as we fight for your few copper coins and our faces are covered in blood? Isn't this intentionally making fun of us?"</p>
<p>The crowd shouted loudly, making him feel fearful. So he immediately shrank his body and fled, quickly jumping back into the original rickshaw, shouting to the driver, "Quick! Quick! Go!"</p>
<p>In front of him, he encountered an armed policeman, so he hurriedly asked the policeman to quickly suppress the situation, on the grounds that a group of "cattle and horses" were shouting and trying to beat him.</p>
<p>The policeman also seemed to take it seriously and hurriedly ran over.</p>
<p>He didn't breathe a sigh of relief until he reached his own door. He saw that the rickshaw puller was covered in sweat.</p>
<p>After a while, the rickshaw puller took the money and asked for a few more coins, but he did not allow it, saying:</p>
<p>"Didn't I agree with you on two dimes? What are you arguing about?"</p>
<p>"No, sir! I ran too fast, I'm too tired, and I waited for you for so long on the Bund."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about that, not another dime."</p>
<p>"But please, sir, do a good deed, we are too pitiful!"</p>
<p>But this humanitarian finally slammed the door shut with a bang, resentfully.</p>

<h3>New Life in Hollywood: Stars Make a Big Fuss Over Babies</h3>
<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>In the past, everyone knew that Hollywood stars competed and flaunted their wealth in terms of clothing, food, housing, and entertainment. But there has never been such a craze for children as there is now. In the past, their weapons against each other were dazzling clothes, luxurious cars, extravagant banquets, and magnificent mansions. Even in terms of entertainment, one built a nine-hole golf course, and others competed to build eighteen-hole courses. After William Hayes laid a carpet covered with various patterns of Earth in the dining room, Dura Bon Hae also covered his dining room with a carpet embroidered with Peruvian orchids. Norma Shearer painted ingenious patterns on her thumb, and Joan Crawford did the same. Their concept of children has never been very important, but now the air in Hollywood has changed. The only weapon they use to flaunt is children.</p>
<p>Recently, the lives of female stars have felt like sailboats in a storm, unsteady and bumpy. Having a child is like a boat having an anchor, thrown into the river, which can be calming. Children are their weapon for seeking happiness, the protectors of fate. Therefore, famous female stars hope to be a famous mother in this world. They feel that one child is not perfect, and if they don't have one, the couple is simply pitiful.</p>
<p>According to Schaefer's friends, he wants to divorce his wife because he longs for a son.</p>
<p>John Miland's wife has two sons from a previous marriage, whom John loves very much. A few months ago, he had one of his own. Recently, he took all three children to court to file a case, requesting to adopt his surname. Now that he has achieved his goal, he feels very proud.</p>
<p>Helen Hayes' second child, Mary, is the famous "Holy Child" TbeActofGodBaby in Hollywood. Before this child was born, she was filming Coquetleo. Because of her childbirth, the film was suddenly suspended. The actors were demanding salaries from the company, and the manager had no choice but to plead with the court. He said that the female star's childbirth was God's sacred act, something that human power could not help (AnActofGcd). At that time, Hollywood newspapers printed the headline TbeActofGodBabyo in the top-tier font. She felt very strange, because the fame of her starring film was not as great as the fame of giving birth to this child.</p>
<p>Although Elino Bowton had already given birth to two daughters, she still could not please Kim Victor, so he married Florence Victor. Florence has given him two daughters, and recently gave birth to a son, so Kim Victor plans to divorce Elino.</p>
<p>Swimming to Hollywood</p>
<p>Olympic Games swimming star, EleanorHolm was recruited by a film company before the Olympics closed. She was originally an actor in the Jigefei Dance Troupe. Now, although she has added the crown of the 100-meter swimming championship, movies are a very good destination for dance and music, so Holm's return to movies is natural and not forced. The lucky film company is Warner Bros.</p>

<h3>Dedicated to Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>Some people say: There are too many stars in China now. Others say there are not enough. These two arguments have different viewpoints. Regarding the saying that there are too many, if we observe carefully, the situation is indeed the case. Just look at the stars in several major companies recently, which seem to be thriving like bamboo shoots after the rain. If we talk about the exciting consciousness they give to the audience in their films, then we feel that the latter is very true. We don't have to determine whether there are too many or not enough. But we must know that the success of a movie star is not accidental. Several necessary conditions must be met: artistic skill, an awareness of the multifaceted nature of the new society, and practical life experience. These are all essential elements for the success of a star. Therefore, we expect the directors to make future actors, or current stars, feel the identity of the characters in the play when a film starts shooting. It is not necessary to overcorrect and seek mechanical movements. This will enable them to give play to their consciousness and achieve a better performance.</p>
<p>The impression we get on the screen now is not satisfactory: often, one or two actors in a film perform reasonably well, but if an actor who is not suitable for the role is squeezed in to make up the number, then the whole film is a complete waste of effort.</p>
<p>Let's give one or two examples: Middle omitted: Because the examples given by the author may be accurate, but these female protagonists who are new to the screen may not be able to appreciate the good intentions of "bitter medicine is good for the mouth," and regard it as intentional fault-finding, difficulty, and attack, and instead lose the author's true intention of encouragement, and from then on become discouraged and not confident. These are all things to consider. Therefore, I decided to cut it out. (Editor's note)</p>
<p>Good health is also an essential element for the success of a star. The foreign actors we see on the screen, whether male or female, are all strong and healthy, with a well-proportioned and healthy body. We must know that what the screen needs now is a healthy aesthetic concept that can stimulate and influence the majority of the audience. The previous "gentle and refined," "too weak to withstand the wind," should not only not be imitated, but should also be eliminated. I hope that the stars who are burdened with artistic mission will stand in a position to drive the wheels of the times, and do not let the times pull themselves by "staying stuck in their ways."</p>

<p>Marlene Dietrich is truly a talented musician in Hollywood. She can use a steel saw to play beautiful melodies that no one can compare to.</p>
<h3>Stars Involved in Lawsuits</h3>
<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich was sued by Josetvon Sternberg's ex-wife, Mrs. RizavonSternbelg, in court for adultery, demanding compensation of 600,000 gold yuan. It is now said that they have reached an out-of-court settlement, but the content has not yet been disclosed.</p>
<p>BeverlyHille's furniture at Shivanson's BeverlyHille residence has been detained in the warehouse because the balance has not been paid, pending resolution in court. She and her husband, MichaelFarmer, are currently filming a PerfectUnderstanding film in England.</p>
<h3>Why Not Come Again?</h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>It is very strange that BusterKeaton and his wife, NatalieTalmadge, have now been granted a divorce by the court. It is a pity that a marriage that others thought was very complete has broken down. I don't know if they are able to separate and unite, and unite and separate. BusterKeaton also can't count how many times this is the breakup, so some people say; they may play the old tune again and get married again.</p>

<h3>The Life of Sternheim (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Readers, please do not be surprised by the unfamiliar name of this director; allow me to first narrate his path to success.</p>
<p>Mr. Stern (Einst Josef Von Sternbeim) is currently thirty-nine years old. He weighs two hundred and eighty pounds, occupies two cubic meters of space, stands two meters and thirty centimeters tall, consumes one kilogram of lamb daily, and ingests four gallons of liquid. His body temperature averages thirty-seven and one-tenth degrees, resulting in seven hundred and fifty grams of excrement. He breathes twenty-one thousand times and has sixty thousand heartbeats daily. He bathes every morning, combs his hair and pubic hair. He is also a believer in the Roman Catholic Church and receives a weekly salary of four thousand five hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine years ago, in a university district in southern Germany, a young Jewish laundress was impregnated by a man. This man was a guards officer with a noble title. Mr. Stern inherited this feudal influence, thus securing guarantees of many special rights. However, his mother claimed she was impregnated by the Holy Spirit, thereby holding a solemn ceremony and bestowing upon this little angel a Trinity gold crown. Of course, such an event, to the atheists in that university district, was considered quite miraculous.</p>
<p>When Mr. Stern was sixteen, he decided on his two lifelong professions, which, although perhaps not considered very great by Easterners, were nevertheless very interesting. Originally, Mr. Stern's mother, in order to liberate her son from the laundry basket and soap bubbles, planned how to choose a more noble profession for him. At that time, a retired major general happened to be running a private hairdressing university. Mr. Stern applied and enrolled, donning the garb of a university student. Of course, needless to say, in the eyes of Mr. Stern's mother, her son could henceforth become an artist, albeit only an artist wielding a comb and scissors. However, he could use this to socialize with gentlemen, powerful officials, or celebrities in academia, which was naturally much nobler than the laundry business. Inspired by his mother, Mr. Stern also expressed considerable joy at this artistic and impulsive profession, even believing that the position of a hairdresser in the art world was as dignified as that of a poet.

<h3>New Female Stars Emerge in the Chinese Film Industry of 1932</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>The domestic film industry has long been conservative and stagnant. Since Chen Yan Yan starred in "Song of the South" and received unanimous praise, various companies have realized the importance of promoting talent. Thus, those who were cultivated by Lianhua into great talents include Wang Renmei, who starred in "Wild Rose"; Tan Ying, who starred in "Regret of a Fallen Woman"; Li Zhuozhuo, who starred in "Humanity"; Li Lili, who starred in "Volcano Passion Blood"; Feng Jiezhen, who starred in "Iron-Willed Orchid Heart"; Xue Lingxian, who starred in "Pink Dreams"; and Lu Xueying, who starred in "New Grievances of the Forbidden City." Tianyi Company also has Yuan Meiyun, who starred in "Little Actress."</p>
<h3>A Scene from Laughable Fate Star</h3>
<p>Zhang Henshui's book "Laughable Fate" is merely so-so (far inferior to "A History of Spring Brightness"); and the Star Film Company's film "Laughable Fate" is also not very amazing (not as good as the old "Jinghua"). But the reason for its sensation, of course, is the mutually supportive promotional power of the two. The Star Film Company sacrificed a huge amount of money, with seventy people going to the old capital, which was also a very attractive advertisement.</p>
<p>Alright! The sixty thousand foot long film, set after set, like "Investiture of the Gods" and "Journey to the West," has already been performed in two-thirds; the remaining fifth and sixth episodes have also been scheduled for public screening. The picture below shows Fan Jiashu (Zheng Xiaoqiu) and He Lina (Hu Die) whispering sweet nothings under the "Justice Prevails" arch in Zhongshan Park, Beiping, in the sixth episode.</p>
<p>Wang Ying, who starred in "A Woman's Cry"; Star Film Company also has Ai Xia, who starred in "Old Hatred and New Understanding"; Hu Ping, who starred in "Resurrection of the National Soul"; Gong Qiu Xia, who starred in "Lovers"; and Zhu Qiuhen, who starred in "Lovely Enemy." Therefore, the Chinese film industry in 1932 was a period of emerging new female stars.</p>
<p>Where is the Former Glory Now?</p>
<p>Five or six years ago, several once-powerful old-brand movie stars, such as Zhang Zhiyun, Yang Naimei, and Xuan Jinglin, are now figures of the past. Since leaving Tianyi, Xuan Jinglin has been wandering aimlessly and has not been sought after. Although it was once rumored that she had joined Logan's United Company, it remains a Southern China dream, and the fact has not been realized. After divorcing Tang Jishan, Zhang Zhiyun was recruited by the Star Film Company and starred in the sound film "Losing Love." The plot of the film alludes to her own life. We thought that the person on the screen was playing the person in the play, and their identities coincided, so the performance must be excellent; who knew that at the preview the other day, eyewitnesses said that the lady had greatly regressed in the art. Not only are the movements sluggish, but they are also close to being artificial. The Star authorities also do not approve of the lady's style, and may not continue the contract in the future. As for Miss Yang Naimei, since leaving Tianyi, no company has hired her except for starring in "Spring Breeze and Willow Branches" for Datong Golden Lion. After marrying Cantonese Chen Xunmin, Naimei's interest in the screen has become increasingly weak. Recently, she has closed her mansion on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession of Shanghai. The couple will leave Shanghai for Hong Kong in a few days. The glamorous shadows on the screen may be permanently discontinued from now on.</p>

<p>Film Essays</p>
<h3>Cherish Your Good Horse Like a Good General</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabeih</p>
<p>When you look in the mirror today, you feel very different from when you looked in the mirror in the past. The you in the mirror also looks different from before. You feel that today's mirror has an unspeakable joy in it. Right?</p>
<p>That's right. You have a relationship with the mirror, so naturally you feel that your shadow is no different than before. Please ask the mirror honestly. Whether your brow bone is high or low. You want him to honestly tell you whether your two eyebrows are parallel, whether they are the same thickness. If the left eyebrow is turned over and used as your right eyebrow, and the right eyebrow is turned over and used as your left eyebrow, can your face change? Are your friends you won't learn from not you? Look again, are your left and right eyes the same size? Are the left and right eyelids the same height? Is there a deep line between the upper and lower eyelids? (That is, single eyelid and double eyelid) If there are two sides, are they exactly the same? Is there a height?</p>
<p>After such an investigation, it is best to record the detailed situation of your own eyes in a notebook. This is worth recording. People's temperament often places great importance on things that have not yet been obtained, and looks down on things that have already been occupied. Two eyes don't really know how much they help us do every day. Because we are used to enjoying blessings, we have never noticed the fatigue of our eyes. If you have already decided to train yourself into a star, you should cherish your eyes from today onwards, just like the good generals of ancient times cherished their good horses.</p>
<p>That's wrong. You might as well put yourself in the shoes of a blind person. A very pitiful blind man! Think about what you want to see, what you can't see. When you are angry, you want to use your eyes to vent your anger, but your eyes cannot be opened. You want to be a star, but the film company refuses to hire real blind people. You don't want to be any kind of star in your life. How pitiful is this!</p>
