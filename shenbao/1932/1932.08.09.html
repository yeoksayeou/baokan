<p>時評</p>
<h3>日人卵翼下之日俄獨立運動華·</h3>
<p>我東北有豐富之寳藏。有努力建設之人民。使能常在平和狀態之下其前途之發展。殊未可限量。而此種發展。不僅爲東亞之福。抑於世界經濟。亦多有裨益。自日本於九一八悍然進兵以來。此廣漠富庶之區。遂變爲東亞混戰之塲。世界禍亂之源乃日人迄未覺悟。一方挾满洲僞國。爲其積極侵略之工具同時更嗾使白俄在北满進行其西伯利亞獨立運動。此種破壞舉動蓋已由對中國之積極侵略。進商可蘇俄積極桃　矣。</p>
<p>據日本報紙所傳。流浪於全世界之白俄。近時異常活動。白俄代表漢定氏定於八月中旬赴日。白俄軍事聯盟極東參謀長彼得羅夫亦將赴日與日政府要人商量樹立新國家計畫彼等之使命。簡單言之。在（奪還祖國促成西伯利亞獨立國。）至其計畫。則擬先在所謂（满洲國）建設白俄軍人村然後再召集軍人三十萬。企圖以武力造成西伯利亞之獨立。漢定與彼得羅夫。自满洲傀儡僞組織成立後。即於四月間彼此協議。將在上海白俄組織之總部移至瀋愓。彼等且早與满鐡當局。關東司令部等要人。迭次折衝。故在北满凿業已召集白俄軍人六萬最近復得西伯利亞州會派之裴格羅懹漢夫博士之援助。飛檄散居全世界之白俄。計畫西伯利亞獨立之方法。準是以觀日人之破壞舉動。將藉白俄之勢力。由满洲而蔓延至西伯利亞矣。</p>
<p>白俄謀西伯利亞獨立。原不自今日始其實際運動在前均告失敗今日復有此企圖。成功與否。尙屬難言。依蘇聯近時軍事工業之發達以及對於遠東之戒備。日本欲在西伯利亞造成一個在其卵翼下之保護國。不能如乘吾多事之際。强迫溥儀在我東北成立僞组織之容易。可斷言者。　　日人北進之大陸政策。以（分而治之）爲手段。換言之。即破壞他國領土之完整而設法統治之。其造成满洲僞组織之用意。實即在此。僞組織造成後則更思施其用華人攻華之毒策。以满足其侵奪領土之野心。彼其嗾使白俄在西伯利亞獨立。對俄之用意與所採之手段。亦復如是。然而自僞组織成立以來。我愛鄕愛國之東北健兒不恤流赤血擲圓顱以相抗。日軍疲於奔命而日僑恐怖亦甚。東北問題去和平解决之途益遠。依此推想。日人嗾使白俄獨立運動。　論成功非易。就令積極進行有成功之望。結果亦惟有召禍而已</p>
<p>日人不恤以軍事行動。從事破壞。毁鄰國領土之完整。爲求向外發展也彼等以爲惟有向外發展。可以救本國經濟恐慌。孰知自其在我東北擾亂以來國内陡增無數饑餓之勞苦民衆。敢爲共産黨或法西斯蒂之前鋒武裝警官昕夕防衛。猶虞力有不逮。軍部爲恐革命勃發。最近更嚴重壓迫人民之自由加緊取締言論。以圖苟安。向外發展之效果如是。猶不及早回頭反而變本加厲。果何爲哉。據柏林電訊。柏林日報駐東京通信員施泰因氏。最近在該報發表一文。討究日本向外發展之運動。其結論謂（日本之目的在革新亞洲經濟。返本還樸。恢復理想中之上古時代。並以日本之精神統治亞洲蓋日本人視其本國精神。在一般國家之上也。）（反本還樸······上古時代）云云確爲今日大開倒車之日本之寫照。中俄兩國人民。不甘退化便應與大開倒車之日本積極抵抗。世界有識人士。若不願東亞復返於上古時氏亦當予開倒車者以懲創。</p>

<p>一入南陽鎭平等縣境界、絕不見罌栗與被毁被焚之屋舍、若别有一天地者、鎭平人彭錫田、號萬廷、曾肄業北京匯文書院、爲中學敎員多年、旋入西北軍幕、諳習軍事訓練、洊升爲西北邊防督辦公署秘書長、民十六年假歸、鎭平匪患正熾、其鄕來匪代表二人、索取槍械、謂苟不與者、焚殺立至、彭怒、斃二代表、集壯丁布置防禦、匪不得逞、自此村民皆奮發知自衛、未幾、彭回任西北軍戰、保衛之事、悉委之鄕人、防務鬆懈、匪勢又猖獗、鄕人無如何、促彭方任河南村治學院院長、醉心提倡村治、民十八年歸鎭平、全縣民衆涕泣環求、勿復出山、彭允之、但要以有錢者出錢、有力者出力、鎭平村治、自此正式開始、</p>
<p>時鎭平已遵令辦自治、分全縣爲若干區、區設辦公所、彭首令各該區普徧調查户口、依調查之結果、於農隙募集壯丁千八百人、編成一混成團、以四個月爲訓練期、依西北軍辦法、施行軍事訓練、兼施民衆敎育、注重精神陶冶、内外塲分班敎練、未識字者課識字、旣識、則令讀書、本縣有匪警、率以往勦、課餘從事工作、如築路造林類、實行陶知行氏敎學做合一主義、鎭平全境縣道鎭道鄕道、皆寬廣平治、井然有條、道旁植樹、無枯萎者、僅本年春季、次就公有林植樹、至一百二十萬株之多、</p>

<p>此經费何自來乎、彭令每畝年納麥二升、但一家不满五畝者免、田多者依累進法照加、此麥一部分充團員膳食、一部分售以充一切費用、有餘則明年减收蓋釆量出爲入法也、彭勸導村民、凡國家正稅、不得滯納、惟苛捐雜稅、與縣長約定、不得以此擾民、民愛戴之、識與不識、皆稱彭先生、一切奉令惟謹、縣長秦某與彭至洽、彭令各村設調解委員會、民有爭執、由會調解、不協、上之區、再不協、上之縣、蓋區與縣皆有會也、委員以地方負物望者充之、自民二十年一月迄二十一年六月、一年有半間、縣府未收一訴狀、縣監獄無　罪犯、調查者以七月往、述所見如此、鎭平全縣、路不拾遺、淅川敎育局長某、携其妻赴鎭平、輿後有篋置金飾、行次失墜、旣覺、及返索、赴區公所報告、正欲訪覓、而村人携篋至、蓋拾得之而不知物主、以報區公所也、此爲最近事實、</p>
<p>南陽一帶、盛行織綢、名南陽綢、鎭平有機二萬、彭爲之籌畫改良、在計議中彭爲人至刻苦、日常行事、用正楷寫日記、十餘年無一日間斷草率者、但口呐呐如不以能言、與之交落落不易合、</p>
<p>鎭平縣人口三十餘萬、有槍一萬餘桿、得團員八九千、足自衛已、於是鄰縣若南陽·南召·新野·内鄕、紛起仿辦、而以内鄕爲最有力、内鄕人别廷芳、號香齏、與彭先後創民團、其訓練與一切工作、大略相似、鄕人尊之曰别司令、有團員、萬餘、其他各縣大都稱是、縣與縣間、鄕與鄕間、設電話互通聲息、聯合自衛、匪不敢犯、犯者無大被重創以去、共黨屢欲由鄂西取道豫西、向北竄關陜、阨於數百里民團聯合帶、不得通過、去歲賀龍占淅川、爲彭别合力逐去之、</p>
<p>河南省主席劉峙嘉其功、奬贈子彈若干萬發、政府令劉鎭華駐南陽、設民團幹部、仿村治學院辦法、設各縣聯合師範學校、專養成各縣民團敎練與村治推行人才、將由此五縣擴大爲二十三縣、在計畫中、</p>

<p>關於僞國攫取東北各關事、總稅司梅樂和、近已發表英文宣言、特譯之如下、</p>
<p>（一）僞國政府自本年二月十七日、组織所謂東北政務委員會之後、卽自行通知東北各關監督及稅務司等、稱各關旣屬僞满洲國所有、自應歸東北政務委員會管轄之、同時各關監督及稅務司等、由該委員會訓令、照常服務、並稱各關已派有日本顧問一名駐關、監視各關一切政務、僞國先以封鎖稅收入手、然後將累積各銀行之關稅没收、最後再以高壓力驅逐各關稅務司、而强制接收各關、其所採取手之續之程序、約如下各節所述、</p>
<p>（二）東北各海關以及民國二十年各關收入之多寡、約可分列如下、</p>
<p>龍井村　海關兩　五十七萬四千兩安東海關兩三百六十八萬二千兩牛莊海關兩三百七十九萬二千兩哈爾濱海關兩五百二十七萬二千兩愛琿雖屬東北海關之一、但以不在僞满洲國勢力範圍之内、故現尙在中國政府管轄之下、而未受僞國勢力之波及、至於大連海關關稅之停匯、以及僞满洲國海關之成立等等、應於本宣言末節、單獨詳論之、以下爲各關近來變遷之情形　▲龍井村延吉關署稅務司華樂士（英人）約於三月上旬接到延吉關監督通知稱、東北政務委員會已經委派日本顧問一員、凡屬海關一切事務、均須與該日顧問商洽云云、惟是時之後、久久未有何種急劇之變動、迨至六月二十一日、該日顧問怱命海關貯欵之朝鮮銀行、凡稅務司所開支票、不得有效、但朝鮮銀行旣屬日商銀行、非在满洲國管轄之下、若不遵稅務司調度海關稅收之命令於法律上自無根據也、至六月廿九日、突有海關監督偕同日本顧問宮本及日本軍官井上等到關宮本井上未入門、而監督則偕同手執手鎗之衛兵人内要求立卽移交、時稅務司以手無寸鐡、當然不能表示反抗、故監督卽將日本顧問延入、宣稱該日顧問已受任該關稅務司之職、龍井村最後匯解稅欵之日、爲本年六月二十二日、總稅務司曾於七月十二日送致以下之公文於日本公使館、但尙未接其答復、該公文如下（銜略）逕啟者、頃准遼吉關署稅務司華樂十呈報稱、該署稅務司及其屬員已爲受命於日本顧問之武人所擯逐、而日本顧問、則尙有當地日本軍官井上與之偕同前往、井據華樂士報稱、琿春分關中國關稅官員英人馬根搩、亦以受武力之干涉、不能行使職務、井身處危險之中等情、特此奉懇代爲調解、何以日本軍事當局、如日本軍官井上等、竟會同满洲國顧問直接干涉中國海關行政（下略）、</p>
<p>▲安東安東關署稅務司鐸博賚所受第一次干涉表示、係在三月初間、由日領事以私人資格、勸告稅務司、謂關監督將請閣下以海關移歸僞國管轄望先爲預備、未幾、卽有海關日顧問之委派、但該顧問至六月中旬、始有積極行動、承轉僞國財政部命令、勒令中國銀行不得再匯稅欵往上海、自是所收稅欵、乃積存中國銀行、迨六月十六日、卽有武裝僞警四名、偕僞警署副督察長日人、往中國銀行通知經理、謂前來看守稅欵、六月十九日、中國銀行乃以七十八萬三千兩解交東三省官銀號、並通知稅務司、謂出於武力脅迫之結果、</p>
<p>安東關稅欵一部份、係存儲朝鮮銀行、該行爲日人公司、享有領事裁判權、不受僞國當道管轄、詎竟不肯匯出稅欵、聲稱奉漢城總行訓令、所有稅欵、解交满洲國政府、並據報告、漢城朝鮮銀行總行、曾將此問題商諸日本外務省及大藏省安東稅欵、旣被奪取之後、第二步及進攫海關行政、六月二十六日及二十七日、日顧問一再要求將海關移交於彼、稅務司當予拒絕、翌日遂有僞監督偕同顧問、第秘書十人等、至關署索取鑰匙、稅務司拒絕其請、卽有兩武裝僞警（俱日人）入室强索、稅務司仍力拒不允、遂有四僞警（皆日人）持來福槍、上剌刀入室、包　稅務司簽押桌、稅務司乃不得不屈服於武力之下、在提出最後抗議後、卽離關署、六月三十日、有安東關員司二十七人（日人二十五名、朝鮮人二名）、呈辭中國海關職務、稅務司乃將其餘效忠海關之員司、遷入稅務司住宅辦公、其地在日人管理之鐡路附屬地内、冀可繼續執行關務、同日日本顧問崎川卽偕便衣武裝日人入稅務司住宅、索取檔案、聲稱如拒絕移交、卽以武力攫取此項檔案、稅務司爲安全計、先期徒往住宅、至是遂向來人抗議其武裝强入坐落日本居留地内之美人住宅、詰問該顧問此舉是否通知日領事、得其同意、該顧問答稱、渠奉命令而行、不受日領事之命令、稅務司仍不允移交、復有三便衣武裝日人入室、見稅務司堅拒不與、卽拔出手槍相向、稅務司遂於槍口之下、被迫交出檔案、立由日人徒去、當時稅務司曾派一英籍關員、往毘鄰日領事署、請其</p>

<p>▲　北昨日常錫蜆子等帮共有十三四艘、本街交易不見十分踴躍、常熟·無錫·崑山·江陰·溧陽等白粳統提二角、早晚稻零椊走動近百石、形無漲跌、變陰元貨色寥寥、開盤定局、全市河廠斛開三千石之譜、</p>
<h3>洋米晨漲晚跌</h3>
<p>昨日洋米承前日之漲風、市氣甚佳、且有北洋帮購買西貢、南京購買小絞、各去千餘包、價乃步漲五分至八分不等、小絞米大至九元八角、繼因報載湘米卽將開禁、贛皖兩省收成亦佳、亦有來申之可能、本街囤户卽有售出、行情立見回落、小絞米自九元七角一分小至六角七分、中次九元六角至四角半、陳小絞開九元三角、共計開出四千包、一號西貢開二千五百包、價十元零三角至二角七分、</p>

<h3>期麥買風盛極一時</h3>

<h3>玻璃維亞的財主</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>渺乎其小全國常備軍不满四千人的玻璃維亞，爲着準備對外作戰，民衆裏面有一位慨當以慷的大資本家巴狄諾氏，捐助軍用飛機十五架，現金數百萬鎊，以供政府的備戰經費。這一條最近的國外新聞，給我們大中華民國的大資本家見了，覺得慚顔麽？</p>
<p>大資本家見了，不見得便會慚顔吧。或者，要笑這位小國大財主巴氏，把國家看的太重，金錢看的太輕了。有了這麽一筆鉅欵，不會存到外國銀行裏去麽？南美銀行靠不住，可以存到北美去；北美銀行靠不住，可以存到歐洲去。有了金錢，到處可以做富翁，戀戀這個玻璃維亞做甚？巴狄諾，我看你不是個俊物，是個外國壽頭。</p>
<p>這不是刻薄之談，事實告訴我，本年一二八之役，一時民衆捐助我們忠勇作戰的第十九路軍和第五軍，只有許多小資本家和非資本家，在裏面踴躍而興奮！他們財力有限，捐助的東西，只是軍米，醃菜，紙烟，絲棉馬甲，以及零碎凑成整數的現金捐欵。若要覓到一個慨當以慷的大資本家，一掏腰包便是飛機十五架現金數百萬鎊的資助軍用，我們大中華民國裏面有没有這般人呢？不消我回答了，孟老夫了早已說過的：然而無有乎爾，則亦無有乎爾。</p>
<p>爲什麽没有呢？大資本家的法律顧問告訴我：敝東的財力，儘有捐助幾架飛機的可能；但是捐助以後，只怕助長内戰，演成轟沈飛鷹兵艦的慘劇，所以只好不拔一毛了；人家的財主，毁家紓難是愛國：我們的財主，不拔一毛也是愛國。</p>
<p>嗄！原來如此，失敬失敬。</p>
<h3>記王敬久師長之言</h3>
<p>— 程小靑</p>
<p>此次十九軍及第五軍之抗日血戰。其壯烈偉大之戰蹟。不特光耀史乘。亦旣深鐫於愛國民衆之心版腦海矣。予今所紀。得諸第五軍八十七師師長舊雨王敬久君之口述。雖憎鱗爪。然信史一斑。足以揭日人諱飾傷亡數之秘幕。而令人聞之神王也。</p>
<p>本月五日。王君蒞蘇檢閱駐蘇部隊。先以電話致予。予因訪諸逆旅。闊别五載。握手道故。欣慰無量。而王君神采奕奕。英邁猶昔。當滬戰時。王君率八十七師作戰。師部駐劉行。奮勇殲敵。每戰輒身先士卒。予因叩其抗日之經過。王君謂此次作戰。其最足欣慰者。即將士之忠勇。與民衆之同仇。每一臨陣。士兵之血爲沸。衝擊摧陷。奮不顧身。此種精神實爲歷次戰爭所未有者。予念苟能以此精神。充盈於全國將士每一人之心坎。則區區島夷。實不足平。</p>
<p>予又詢敵人死傷之數究有若干。因據日軍部之公佈。死者僅四五百。傷亦不逾三千。雖明知其僞。而聆之未免氣短。王君莞爾曰。（此殆日人之欺人自欺耳。三十三日之鏖戰。敵人之死傷纍纍·至少必在一萬以上。嘗憶某次。敵人乘吾方之鐡絲綱尙未佈張妥密。驟以大隊衝鋒。吾軍俟其深入。亦率隊迎攻。敵人聞喊殺聲起。人人膽落。全隊潰退。然衝入時自鐡絲綱未佈之間隙而進。退時駭亂。乃不能從容得間而出。故全隊士兵三四百。幾悉數葬於吾軍彈火之下。則彼所云僅死四百餘者。未免滑稽太甚也。（予聆此。爲之神王稱快。</p>
<p>王君部隊現駐首都。方加緊訓練。俾成勁旅。以備保國禦敵。士兵每日除講堂上之學識科外。技術操練。亦有五小時之多。雖炎暑無間。而王君雖身爲師長。總握虎符。而擘畫訓練。仍必躬必親。即每日上操。亦親加督率。工作終朝。幾無片刻寗息。嘗謂際此國命絕續之交。身任軍役者。實不忍偷息自逸。其言殊足以發一般軍人之深省。王君年少眞純。儉樸謙和。有儒將風。方予往訪時。蘇城公安局長茅迺功君方就寓欵宴。座中有駐軍軍官數人及德顧問等。團附傅君殷殷以戰術請益。故所談皆關係戰術。茅君亦參加討論。應對如流。予初頗訝茅君以行政官。而於軍事知識何亦如數家珍。後乃知彼係王君之舊同事。曩曾任第二軍參謀長。固亦一軍事專家也。後駐軍領袖傅團附。一再以派遣衛兵爲請。王君力却之。茅君笑曰。（王師長乃平民師長。初無需此。）即此精神。亦有足多者也。</p>
<h3>瓜李艶名</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>浮甘瓜於淸泉。沉朱李於寒水。曹氏子之雋語。傳誦千古。蓋瓜與李同爲夏日之嘉果。可解暑吻者也。然瓜李俱有艶名。瓜得小娘之號。李居夫人之稱。古籍闕未載列。是不可不有以記述之。</p>
<p>不娘瓜。香瓜之一種也。色白質嫩。彷彿女郎之玉肌。剖之瓤紋細緻。汁甘似飴。我友徐君卓呆。在江灣治圃。栽小娘瓜满畦。夏日瓜熟。徐君親擷之以貽戚友。予亦曾啖嘗之。果與常口逈異。今歳倭人犯境。圃付一炬。小娘瓜之佳種。無復有存。惜哉。</p>
<p>目前藝海迴瀾社諸社友。携　千餘。赴杭展覽。借明秀之湖山。開書畫之盛會。逸興遄飛。豪情飇發。頗多佳話。諸社友有之江迴瀾紀以述之。當長車之過嘉興也。有筐以　果者。果殷紅而圓。濟羣斥一金。購得六七十枚。曰。廉哉槜李。因分貽社友而快朶頣焉。其石禾人。知禾産。曰。槜李每金祇二三枚。此非槜李。乃夫人李也。諸社友僉曰。艶哉斯名。艶哉斯名。馬萬里亟詢其石以夫人李之本幹如何。枝葉又如何。擬調丹靑以爲畫幅也。夫人李圖成。幸乞萬里賜示欣賞。昔人望梅止渴。今人不妨望李解纔也。一笑。</p>
<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>▲一撮毛</p>
<p>故都細民未盡脫除舊時代之虛榮觀念。往時都中婚禮儀仗較簡。旗人風俗尙存古意。多以婚時列喜字燈數十對。卽爲最靡　者。然自華整可喜。惟喪殯之儀則殊繁缛。其俗靈輿以六十四槓爲最隆。謂以六十四人舉柩也。以次遞殺。至於八人。其槓髹朱絕巨。每逢舉殯。輒暴諸衢路。號日晾槓。其棺罩依會典儀制。得施綵繪。近年多濫以華繡爲飾。絕無所本。以悅俗目而已。然華蓋金　。流蘇四注。有龍　之遺意。凡業此者日槓房。槓房輒以舉柩平穏自矜。相傳習此者須以盆水置柩上。升降俯仰而不溢爲能事。蓋舁人旣多。人體雖動而柩自平。固有可矜也。其首領前行。相度地勢。高卑寬狹。以響尺節其步趨。必詳必愼。自非他處所能及。喪儀行列。長或延及數里。蓋會典所制儀仗之外。俗人又以意增爲之。近多以白紙象柳枝持之。號日雪柳。於古未之聞也。其行列甚疎。故覺其愈長。又分左右而行。故雖長而不碍道中之車馬也。然此皆漢人之俗。满人喪儀有迴别者。其柩杼首而削旁。有似圭形。似其形製美於漢人之柩。宗室王公柩前懸貂一頭以爲徽識。猶有朔漠遺風。儀仗亦不似漢人之繁缛。北俗出殯必撒紙錢。剪纸象錢疊而持之。撒於空中。飛舞而下。頗繽紛可觀。有專業此者。其人頷旁有一撮毛。因以爲號。其人能撒之至高、矜爲神技。於是富貴之家。欲誇流俗。必雇此人。由此聲價愈高。喪家不得此人。至以爲恨事。嘻、北俗之誇誕顓愚。眞不可及矣。夫紙錢固已非古。唐之中葉。始聞此說。然猶焚以資冥福。若沿路飛爲　　之花。以喪儀博閭閻兒女之一笑。是何爲者耶。近年以來。俗人無知。專以侈其富厚閧動市人爲貴。南北皆然。推求其故。蓋以開元禮以後有不預凶事之說。於大喪無明交制定。遂得任意鋪張。致失常執。宣統中那拉后之殯卽靡誕無比。多不衷於古制。惡俗相沿。有由來矣。婚儀有定制。自不可踰。民國十一年遜帝婚儀。頗存古制。　簿　仗。具體而微。淸宵傳警。風送旌旗。與馬蹄緩緩之聲相應。眞如閱畫圖也。</p>
<h3>古廟敲鐘錄（六十九）</h3>
<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>七十六</p>
<p>我這幾天的主張是越弄越激烈了。朱先生突然問我說：（假使你拿了一省或全國的敎痛權，你預備怎樣去幹？）我毫不遲疑的回答說：（停辦學校，改設工廠！（朱先生問：（爲什麽不辦工學團？那工廠二字可怕！）我說：（我要辦的當然是工學團，不過我想要偏重生産之工以糾正傳統的消費之學。我在城裏聽說幾十年來農業學校，工業學校，實業學校，職業學校是幾乎完全失敗。我考察他們失敗的原因雖多而主要的就害在這塊學校的招牌。掛了學校的牌子，那些只會動嘴不會動手的先生學生都可以濫竿了。他們用學校的招牌做盾牌，可以暫時躱避時代的攻擊。他們哄騙社會說：（我們是在提倡生産敎育了。可是你們不要性急。你不能捉隻老母鷄來立刻呌她生蛋。過幾年，或者過幾十年我自然會生大鷄蛋，你看。）現在我們已經知道這隻老母鷄是只會拉屎不會生蛋了。我不願書獃子再躱在工學團的盾牌後面做蛀書蟲，所以直截了當的把學堂一齊改成工廠。朱先生說；（你的辦法極痛快！可是你要留心，書獃子雖然不會做工種田，却會演說，登報，寫文章，上條陳，發宣言。你的命運是會背着摧殘敎育之罪名下臺。結果是你的工廠辦不成，他們仍舊辦他們的學校一直到亡國。亡國他們也不怕，因爲殖民地也用得着不事生産的先生學生做麻醉的工具列。還有一層你要留心。你只知道學校裏有蛀書蟲，不知道工廠裏有拜金蟲。只要你把工廠的招牌掛起來，你些拜金蟲都會蜂擁而來了。這裏大家只顧賺錢。這裏黄金貴於一切，比人命還貴重！所以即使你能把工廠辦成，也不是你心目中的工廠了。一般辦學校的是抱着書本而忘了人生；一般辦工廠的是抱着黄金面忘了人生；一般社會運動者是抱着標語而忘了人生。從這樣改到那樣，從那樣改到這樣，若忽略了人生的大前提，都會使你失望。我們的工學團只是以人生爲大前提，在我們心目中，人生是超過一切。因爲要培養合理的人生所以反對學校，工廠，及一切忽略人生之組織而要創造出一種富有人生意義的工學團。你把學校改爲工廠是以一種缺乏人生意義的組織來替代另一種缺乏人生意義的組織，結果是趕了一羣狼來了一羣虎。我不願在你的熱烈的火花上澆冷水。也許你的意見是含了一部份眞理：要想打破根深蒂固的積習，難免要用些矯枉過正的手段。但是千萬不可忘了（培養合理的人生）乃是我們眞正的宗旨。）</p>

<h3>留學生的三個照片</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>照片是汉没有談頭的，尤其是留學生的照片，更没有可談性，但我的見解，却不如此。</p>
<p>留學生第一個照片，就是將要出洋的時候，他一定要登張照片，如某君在某某大學畢業，成績優良，現擬赴某國留學，定於某日放洋云云，一個照片。　　留學生第二個照片，就是某君在某國某某大學留學，現已畢業，學問優良，深得校長器重，定於某月某日乘輪回國，他日當出其所學，歸餉祖國，我國又得一政治傑出人才云云，又來一個照片。</p>
<p>留學生第三個照片，某君在某國留學，研究某某之學，頗有心得，大約明年暑假畢業，他日學成返國，其貢獻於祖國，實無限量云云，亦來一個照片。　　我想赤求學儘管求學，歸國儘管歸國，何必定要登載一二三三張照片呢？在報紙爲人宣傳，損失了少許新聞地位，到也不生問題，我不是刻薄的話，這種照片，完全是一種虛榮心的表現，似乎看到出洋留學，當作一件了不得的事情，驚人的傑作，這種頭腦，深爲可鄙，何怪中國人看到外國人，要視若天人，五體投地呢？僅僅做了幾年的留學生，已經變爲了不得的人物，無怪生長外國的舶來品道地人物，眞是還當了得麽？</p>
<p>并且留學外國的幾位先生，我考察他們的頭銜，不是法學博士，便是政治經濟學博士，而欲研究工藝商業等等實用之學，非常難得，試問政治經濟，是什麽東西，拆穿西洋鏡說，不是（陞官發財）的代名詞麽，研究政治，便想做官，研究經濟，便想發財，這不是陞官發財的表現麽？</p>
<p>我再以照片來說，現在出風頭的照片，本來甚爲風行，一是電影明星，二是歌塲舞女，三是新掛大律師招牌保障人權的法學家，多想登張照片，出出風頭，招來招來生意，試問留學生的三個照片，其用意究安在呢？</p>
<p>我想中國這樣的博士愈多，中國愈無辦法，愈無希望，</p>

<h3>機器油</h3>
<p>— 左</p>
<p>五十前，所有機器油皆由動物脂肪或植物質製成。如牛羊脂，鯨腦油，海豚油，菎麻子油，棕油等，都有廣大的用途。惟鯨油易乾，現罕用之。但海豚油仍應用於小型的手錶，牛羊脂仍用於某種汽機，菎麻子油制幤用於巨大的渦輪。但這些都是例外，現在從石油製成的潤滑料實際已將其他一切潤滑料取而代之了。原因是動植物油善於吸收空氣裏的氧氣，因而腐敗凝厚，變爲有害於金屬的酸質。礦物性的石油潤滑料即絕無此種缺點。</p>
<p>機器油種類極多，各專用，没有一種能適合一切用途的，一滴飛機油，用於手錶，可以使其停滯。反之，手錶油加入飛機摩達中，便失效用。單是汽車所用潤滑料，也有十二種之多。</p>
<p>機器油不會耗損，只會因吸收濕氣，塵埃及氧氣而消失潤滑效用。機油吸收氧氣以後，即生成一種化合物，雖暫時溶解於油中，但一遇冰冷的表面，便分析而爲堅硬的物質，殊有碍於輪軸的運轉。</p>
<p>良好的機器油必須具備下列幾個條件：（一）富有黏性，足以隔離金屬面；（二）富有流動性，能深入輪軸的一切空隙；（三）要有凝集力，不但能固着於金屬面上，且能形成薄膜而持之恒久；（四）能發散熱量，使軸承常冷；（五）不易乾燥，亦不致凝厚；（六）絕無酸性存在，不致侵蝕金屬。從石油製出的機器油比較的最切近這一切條件。但實騐家仍在孜孜研究，以求盡善盡美。</p>

<h3>討論會廢除迷信的先决問題如何破除迷信</h3>
<p>— 程浩</p>
<p>講到求神拜佛之無益，非但靡費有用的金錢，並且延誤大事，關係民生很巨。本來傳染病之流行，實是一種不淸潔不講衛生的結果，而一般迷信的人民却說是瘟神下降，以爲必須打醮超度鬼神，才可免除這種災禍。對於防疫，講衛生，毫不加以注意，因此不知要誤送了多少生命。我國一般婦女，對於其他的一切，多不很肯拿出錢來，獨於來神拜佛的一切用費，却很肯慷慨解囊。有的雖然家庭經濟不裕，諸多省儉，而於香燭之費，必在困難之中如數籌出，以爲將來菩薩可以何護其發財。假使統計全民這一項大靡費，必很可觀，如果能將這項欵子，用來辦公共的事業，也必很可一看了。</p>
<p>迷信的重要關係性如此，所以我們必須想想方法打破他。怎樣能打破呢？現在我且將我的愚見寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）將各地廟字改作公共事業的機關，或辦民衆學校，並焚燒一切偶像。人民如有迎神賽會的迷信舉動，地方當局應當干涉禁止。</p>
<p>（二）注重宣傳，灌輸普通常識。他們受了這種感化頭腦稍淸的人，或者能夠打破昏迷，不再迷信了。</p>
<p>（三）要根本剷除迷信觀念，還要注意兒童。因爲我國的舊家庭中，爲長者每命兒童要敬鬼神，有了這不好的敎訓，兒童自然要被傳染了。我希望小學的敎師們，對於（迷信）這個問題加以注意，隨時對學生加以指正。</p>
<p>我以爲（迷信）問題，在我國實在很是重要，希望大家用點精神來討論，想出一些（打破）的好方法來</p>

<p>社会的一角</p>
<h3>也是一個麫包問題</h3>
<p>— 阿·楊·</p>
<p>一個不調和的調子</p>
<p>天氣實在熱得太厲害了，午覺醒來，想做一點事情也不能做，我伸手到褲包裏摸一摸公園派司，便踏着我的破皮鞋走向法國公園去了。</p>
<p>那時大約已經三點多鐘了，公園裏的許多靠几已被先來的人們佔了去，但那樹根下死板凳却一條一條的在那兒休息着，因此·我便選了一個比較蔭涼的地方坐下。</p>
<p>在平常，當我每次到公園裏去的時候我總要帶着一本書或一份報紙去的，可是今天竟把這件事情忘掉了，一個人獨坐在一條死板凳上眞有些無聊啊，雖然我的身邊曾有着許多男男女女，但都是些陌生人，我不認識他們也正和他們不認識我一樣，而且，我討厭他們！雖然我的耳際也震盪着歌聲和笑聲，然而，這是我所不願聽的音樂呢！</p>
<p>於是我把肩兒靠在身後的樹上，閉了眼睛，打算小寐一下，但在這喧嘩的週遭里，我怎麽睡得着呀！當一個沉重的脚步聲經過我的面前時，我便竪直身躯，並且睜開我的眼睛來了，這時候，我發現了對面的死板凳上也來了一個外國女郎獨坐那裏。</p>
<p>不知道她是英國的，法國的，還是他國的女郎，她的年紀約模二十來歲，她穿的是一件素白的衣衫，一條湖色的短裙，不着襪子，一雙緋紅的脚兒满满的塡在上鞋裏面，衣衫上設有袖管，她那嬌嫩的兩臂也擺在外邊，襯着那素雅的衣裝，愈顯出她的可愛，而且，當她偶兒扭動的時候，那豐美的兩個乳房便在柔簿的襟下跳躍起來，這一跳躍啊，似乎能把每個男子的心都彈動了，她的鼻子並不十分高，眼睛是黑的，也不像别的一般灰藍得可怕。</p>
<p>不知怎的，我一見她就彷彿領受了充分的快感，我覺得她簡直是一件美術品呢，所以我常常偷看她，任她也常常望我，可是，當我們的視綫相觸的時候，我便不知不覺的低下頭來，雙頰上彷彿有血火在焚燒，我又彷彿當一個行竊的偷兒被主人發現了時一般的恐怖，而她，似乎還在向我微笑，在我看來，這簡直是一種更大的責罰啦。</p>
<p>數分鐘以後，我又不知不覺的抬起頭來偷看她了，啊，可眞奇怪，這時候竟有一位安現少年坐在她的身邊了，他身材很矮，穿一套白色的棉質西裝，戴的也是一頂白色的巴拿馬帽，在這白色的衣冠的襯托之下，他那付生來就已經很黑的面龐却顯得格外難看了，他坐在她的右邊，臉兒朝左，嘴兒呶動着，好像在向她訴說什麽或商量什麽，可是她一聲也不嚮，但在在又回過頭來把他打量一下，也不睬他，也不拒絕他。</p>
<p>於是我開始懷疑了，我想，大約她是個生意經吧，當時我曾聯想到蔣交慈在他的麗沙的哀怨中所描寫着的關於一個俄國妓女麗沙在虹口公園中兜攬生意的情形來，於是我更注意她，最後我已經肯定了她是個與麗沙同一命運的人了。</p>
<p>大約是爲了那位安南少年生得太不漂亮了吧，所以她常常向我微笑，並且把秋波送向我來，那位安南少年也正在用嫉妒的眼睛看我，我恐怕因此而破壞了他們的買賣並且失了我的眼福，於是我便立起身來，走到和他們相距較遠的地方又坐下了，在那裏，我可以仔細的窺探他們，但他們却不看見我，因爲我的地位剛剛在他們的背面。</p>
<p>那男的仍在呶動着他的嘴唇，她也和從前一樣一聲不嚮，但常常回頭看他。</p>
<p>最後她跋步走了，數秒鐘後，他也追趕上去，當他倆先後經過了一排矮樹而再出現於我的眼簾時，已經是一對手捥手的好人兒了。</p>
<p>一個是長的，一個是短的，一個是黑的，一個是白的－啊，這是多麽不調和的一個調子－想到這裏，我不禁失笑了。</p>
<p>剛出門的時候我又碰見了他倆，這時他倆正在一個零食店前圍着一張藤椅飲冰呢，她見了我，露出十分羞慚的樣子來，這使非常不安，在歸途中我還尋不出一個圓满的答覆來。</p>

<h3>龔大哥的喜訊</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>年齡已近三十歲的龔大哥，照理說眞是非有個妻室不可。近天來他眞的在積極進行，而且已有了相當的對象，這是我們應當爲他慶祝的。今天，我又會著了他，當然我第一句話就該詢問他的婚事。</p>
<p>（老兄！恭喜恭喜！聽說你現在已找著嫂夫人了。不知什麽時候有得喜酒吃）？</p>
<p>（謝謝！謝謝！不過，···不過·····這個不行得很不行得很）。這是他的回答。他說話時老愛摇著頭，同時也並不怎樣長於詞令：譬如說，不應該重覆的地方他也重覆，雖然他自已是確說得非常吃力，可是聽的人到反而模糊起來。其後我仔細的聽著他報告最近的經過。我完全没有擾亂他，我讓他能夠充分的說明他所要說的一切。</p>
<p>（昨天，昨天夜裏，我一個人又去看了她。在一個小弄堂裏。可惜那裏臭得很。不行，她，她腐敗得很。她第一句話就要我賭咒，不相信我二十九歲還没有老婆。我眞没有辦法。我說賭咒是不爲憑的，即使我發誓（我將不得好死），可是我眞的就會死嗎？我說你去調查好了。其後她說結婚時要坐花轎，並且，並且···馬上結婚。這眞没有辦法。我想這是馬上談不到的。我說還是先　　朋友，大家摸摸性子，但是她說行結了婚然後摸性子也可以的，結了婚還怕不懂得丈夫的性情嗎？這眞没有辦法。那末，那末我說假使···假使大家···大家性情不對，那末離婚嗎？·····她說離婚是决然不離的：同時也不贊成　朋友；因爲不知道的人還以爲一個大姑娘在外面　···　姘頭。這眞没有辦法。其後又說到結婚要坐花轎，當然我是不贊成，那···那不是寃枉花錢嗎？我主張儘可能的簡單一點：你說對嗎？可是她一定要坐花轎，說到最後還是要坐花轎。這眞是没有辦法－······不過我相信她對我是很好，爲了···爲了要見我，將幾年做工所積下的三粒金紐扣換了兩粒做新衣裳，在别人面前也老是，老是誇我好。可是·····可惜腦筋太腐敗了：女人到是满規矩的。···聽說她自已做工所賺的錢，在鄕下還買了幾畝田。···人到是···，可惜就是太腐敗了。眞是没有辦法。······）　　他似乎話已說已完，視線停留在我的臉上，好像是在等我回答；然而當我正在預備開口的時候，他却又馬上接下去了：</p>
<p>（其實我···我也因爲···因爲賺的錢不多，假如現在有錢的話，就是馬上結婚，坐花轎，我也没有什麽不可以的）。</p>
<p>他的話又說回來了，當然我也勸他不妨遷就一點。何况這所謂新舊的衝突在現代中國是普遍的現象。最後我祝福他們能夠很快的成功，因爲無論誰都是愛吃喜酒的。</p>

<h3>The Japanese Under the Wings of the Russo-Japanese Independence Movement in China</h3>
<p>Our Northeast possesses abundant resources and hardworking people. If it could remain in a state of peace, its future development would be immeasurable. This development would not only benefit East Asia but also contribute significantly to the world economy. However, since Japan's brazen invasion on September 18th, this vast and wealthy region has been transformed into a battlefield for East Asian conflicts and a source of global turmoil. The Japanese have yet to realize this. On one hand, they are using the puppet state of Manchukuo as a tool for their aggressive invasion. Simultaneously, they are instigating White Russians in northern Manchuria to carry out their Siberian independence movement. This destructive action has progressed from active aggression against China to active incitement against Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, White Russians scattered around the world have recently become unusually active. A White Russian representative, Mr. Handin, is scheduled to visit Japan in mid-August. The Chief of Staff of the White Russian Military Alliance in the Far East, Petrov, will also travel to Japan to discuss plans for establishing a new state with key figures in the Japanese government. Their mission, in short, is to "reclaim their homeland and promote the independence of Siberia." Their plan involves first building White Russian military villages in the so-called "Manchukuo," and then recruiting 300,000 soldiers, attempting to create an independent Siberia by force. Handin and Petrov agreed in April, after the establishment of the Manchukuo puppet organization, to move the headquarters of the White Russian organization in Shanghai to Shenyang. They have also repeatedly negotiated with key figures in the South Manchurian Railway authorities and the Kwantung Army Headquarters. As a result, they have already gathered 60,000 White Russian soldiers in northern Manchuria. Recently, they have also received assistance from Dr. Peglov-Hannoff, sent by the Siberian Regional Council, who is issuing calls to White Russians scattered around the world to plan the independence of Siberia. Based on this, it can be seen that Japan's destructive actions will use the power of the White Russians to spread from Manchuria to Siberia.</p>
<p>The White Russian's attempt to seek Siberian independence did not begin today. In fact, previous movements have all failed. It is still difficult to say whether this attempt will succeed. Given the recent development of Soviet military industry and its preparedness for the Far East, it will not be as easy for Japan to create a protectorate in Siberia under its wings as it was to force Puyi to establish a puppet organization in our Northeast when we were beset by internal troubles. It can be asserted that Japan's continental policy of northward expansion uses "divide and conquer" as a means. In other words, it destroys the territorial integrity of other countries and then tries to rule them. This is precisely the intention behind creating the puppet organization of Manchukuo. After the puppet organization was created, it then thought of using the poisonous strategy of having Chinese attack Chinese to satisfy its ambition to seize territory. Its incitement of White Russians to seek independence in Siberia, its intentions towards Russia, and the means it employs are also the same. However, since the establishment of the puppet organization, our patriotic Northeastern heroes have not hesitated to shed blood and sacrifice their lives to resist. The Japanese army is exhausted, and Japanese residents are also very fearful. The path to a peaceful resolution of the Northeast problem is becoming increasingly distant. Based on this, it is not easy for Japan to incite the White Russian independence movement to succeed. Even if it actively proceeds and has a chance of success, the result will only be to invite disaster.</p>
<p>Japan does not hesitate to use military action to engage in destruction, damaging the territorial integrity of neighboring countries, in order to seek external expansion. They believe that only external expansion can save their country's economic panic. Who knows that since they have been causing trouble in our Northeast, countless starving and suffering people have suddenly increased in their country. They dare to be the vanguard of the Communist Party or the Fascists. Armed police officers defend day and night, still fearing that their strength is not enough. The military, fearing the outbreak of revolution, has recently severely suppressed the freedom of the people and intensified the suppression of speech in order to seek temporary peace. The effect of outward expansion is like this. It is not as good as turning back early, but instead, it becomes even more serious. What is the purpose? According to a Berlin dispatch, Mr. Stein, the Berlin Daily's correspondent in Tokyo, recently published an article in the newspaper examining Japan's outward expansion movement. His conclusion was that "Japan's goal is to reform the Asian economy, return to simplicity, restore the ideal ancient times, and rule Asia with the spirit of Japan. The Japanese view their national spirit as superior to that of other countries." The words "return to simplicity... ancient times" are indeed a portrayal of Japan, which is now going backward on a grand scale. The people of China and Russia, unwilling to degenerate, should actively resist Japan, which is going backward on a grand scale. If enlightened people in the world do not want East Asia to return to ancient times, they should also punish those who are going backward.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Chiang Telegraphed that He Would Advance and Retreat with Wang</h3>
<p>Lin, Chiang, and Wang Plan to Meet in a Specific Location to Discuss Military and Political Plans</p>
<p>Chiang Sends Zhou Gengsheng to Shanghai to Persuade Wang to Return to His Post</p>
<p>Most Central Leaders Advocate Approving Zhang's Resignation</p>
<p>Chen Shuren Resigns as Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Gu Mengyu Will Also Resign (Nanjing) Chiang telegraphed He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, and others, stating that no matter what, Wang’s resignation as President must be firmly and comfortingly retained. If Wang decides not to do it, the younger brother will also resign and not do it. Afterwards, he urgently telegraphed He, Zhu, and the three others, saying that President Wang is currently in Shanghai. Please, the two brothers, go to Shanghai as soon as possible to earnestly retain him. Therefore, He first went to Shanghai on the evening of the 7th, and Zhu also followed on the morning of the 8th. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chiang summoned Wang Minjie and instructed him to forward a telegram to Cai Yuanpei, urging Wang to return to Nanjing, and sent Wuhan University professor Zhou Gengsheng as a representative to Shanghai to persuade him in person. Zhou took the Jiangyu ship east on the 8th. When passing through Nanjing, he will invite Tang Youren to go with him. Chiang is temporarily unable to return to Nanjing because he is presiding over the suppression of bandits in Hankou. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Lin, Wang, and Chiang Will Meet Once</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of President Wang's resignation, Lin, Wang, and Chiang will hold a meeting in the near future to discuss a proper solution. After Luo Wengan's letter of resignation was sent, he still went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work on the 8th, waiting for someone to succeed him before handing over the duties. Chairman Lin is extremely worried about Wang's resignation and has telegraphed Wang from Lushan, urging him to return to Nanjing immediately to preside over government affairs, and to discuss everything at length. It is heard that Lin plans to come to Nanjing and then to Shanghai within a few days to personally express his condolences and retain him, and invite Chiang to return to Nanjing for a trip to discuss all military and political plans. It is also heard that the meeting place for Lin, Wang, and Chiang has been selected at Lushan, and is currently still being telegraphed. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Telegram Has Not Yet Arrived in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chucang said that Zhang Xueliang's telegram to the Central Government had not arrived as of the morning of the 8th. It should arrive in Nanjing tomorrow. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, the Yishi Daily reported that Zhang Xueliang had decided to resign and will issue a general telegram to retire today. Northern military affairs will be taken over by the Military Reorganization Council, and political affairs will be presided over by the Beiping Political Council. Zhang has requested the Central Government to send personnel to take over. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon's official field news is that Zhang Xueliang's position is now the same as after last night's military meeting, with no changes. It was decided last night that Zhang should hand over the northern political power to the Political Council, the financial power to the Finance Committee, and the military power to the Military Reorganization Council. This proposal is still valid. Zhang is the chairman of the Political Council, a member of the Finance Committee, and a member of the Military Reorganization Council. Zhang has not resigned from these several positions. Finally, according to official field news, Zhang has no intention of leaving Beiping or getting rid of everything. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Business Community in Beiping Asks Zhang Not to Mention Retirement</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Representatives of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce Leng Jiaji and representatives of the Autonomous Committee Zhou Zhaoxiang visited Zhang at 5:00 PM, requesting that he prioritize the security of North China and not easily mention retirement. Zhang's resignation remains firm. (8th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Defends Himself Against Wang's Telegram</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Last night at 6:00 PM, military leaders convened a special meeting regarding Wang Jingwei's resignation. The meeting adjourned at 8:15 PM. The content has not yet been announced, but Zhang Xueliang may announce the results of the meeting when he meets with reporters at his residence this afternoon. Official field sources mentioned the matter of Nanjing raising funds in Wang's telegram, saying that Minister of Finance Song Ziwen had recently traveled to Beiping and promised to do his best to raise 5 million yuan. As for the Railway Ministry's 2 million yuan, it is well known that Zhang Xueliang is currently using certain funds from the Beiping-Shenyang Railway for administrative needs, so he requested the government to transfer the accounts. Regarding the 3 million yuan for Rehe, although Rehe is a province with only 800,000 people, with an income of 1.5 million yuan, it is necessary to support eight brigades of border defense troops, which is already insufficient in peacetime, and even more insufficient in the current extraordinary state. Therefore, Tang Yulin is seeking financial assistance from the central government. However, in fact, Zhang Xueliang has not telegraphed Wang Jingwei to request an allocation of 3 million yuan for Rehe's expenses. The section in Wang's telegram stating that Zhang Xueliang intends to request 3 million yuan from the Central Executive Yuan in the name of resisting in Rehe is completely unfounded. Zhang Xueliang has repeatedly stated that he is eager to make all telegrams public and let the people of the country judge the overall facts. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Luo Wengan Plans to Temporarily Maintain Government Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan told visiting reporters that after someone resigns, he will continue to be responsible for maintaining foreign relations until approval is received. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Most Important People Advocate Approving Zhang's Resignation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Most of the important people in the Central Government advocate approving Zhang Xueliang's resignation and telegraphing Chiang to solicit his opinion. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Gu Mengyu Resigns as Minister of Railways</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Zeng Zhongming returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 8th, he immediately visited Gu Mengyu to discuss everything. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Neither Gu Mengyu nor Zeng Zhongming attended the temporary standing committee meeting on the 8th. After Gu was summoned to Shanghai by Wang, he planned to telegraph his resignation from the position of Minister of Railways, and Zeng Zhongming was appointed to act as his agent. (8th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that Chen Gongbo and Gu Mengyu are both people who will advance and retreat with Wang. Since Wang has resigned, they should not stay, and they will also retire following Wang. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Meeting Will Proceed as Usual</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Executive Yuan, Deputy President Song, He Yingqin, Huang Shaoxiong, Chen Gongbo, Zhu Jiahua, and other ministers in Shanghai are all scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 9th. The Executive Yuan meeting on the 9th will proceed as usual. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi telegraphed from Beiping (to return to Nanjing immediately). (Nanjing) Li Jishen took the night train to Shanghai on the 8th to persuade Wang to stay. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Central Committee Discusses Attitude Towards Wang</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and others of the Guangdong Central Committee discussed their attitude towards Wang's resignation on the 8th and decided to wait and see how the central government changes, and temporarily did not express their attitude. The two committees then telegraphed Wang in a private capacity, urging him not to have any thoughts of retreating, but to perform his duties and punish Zhang Xueliang to the full extent of the law, as a warning to those who do not resist, and to apologize to the people. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zou Lu reported at the Political Council's memorial week on the 8th that Wang resigned because Zhang did not resist, which was very heartbreaking. However, Wang, as the president of the Executive Yuan, knew that Zhang did not resist, but still asked the government for money. The government did not punish Zhang, which was Wang's dereliction of duty. If Wang could resign to apologize to the people because he was incompetent, his declaration now says that he resigned to apologize to Zhang, which is really a slip of the tongue. The Executive Yuan is a responsible cabinet. Wang has resigned, but instructs the ministers not to resign, which is difficult to understand. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Chen Shuren Submits Resignation as Chairman of the Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shuren entered the Executive Yuan on the day to submit his resignation as Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The original submission stated, "Presented for the matter of earnestly requesting resignation. Shuren is a scholar who is isolated and independent by nature, and his political interests have long been faint. In recent years, he has lived in seclusion in his hometown, concentrating on art, thinking of contributing to the world through research and discussion. Unexpectedly, the Northeast Incident arose, and the national crisis deepened day by day. President Wang took office to overcome difficulties and sincerely invited him, so he tried to work together and prepared himself in the central government, and there was no transgression. Now that President Wang has telegraphed his resignation, Shuren's righteousness is the same, and he has no hesitation. He can only state the facts and earnestly request that he be allowed to be relieved of his original position as Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, so that he can unload his burdens and be able to rest and specialize in art, contributing to the country through division of labor, and fulfilling his original intention. He is grateful and awaits orders." (8th Central Telegram)</p>
<h3>Gu Discussed Reasons for Wang's Resignation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Mengyu said, "President Wang's resignation is not a personal attempt to shirk responsibility, but a retreat to the virtuous because his proposals cannot be realized. Now, the Central Government, in addition to telegraphing condolences and retention, has also sent He and Ju, two members, to visit Wang and retain him in person. Whether Wang can resume his post will be clear when He and Ju return to Nanjing. But according to my observation, since Wang has firmly requested resignation because his proposals cannot be realized, it is feared that his intention to resign cannot be dispelled by a single telegram of condolence or by sending representatives to retain him. It is necessary to study the reasons for his resignation and resolve his administrative difficulties before he can be expected to resume his post. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee decided on a policy of self-defense and resistance. Since then, repeated resolutions have been made at various standing committee meetings. The current problem is whether this established policy can be implemented. The Japanese army has forcibly occupied the three eastern provinces, and now intends to invade Rehe and disturb Beiping and Tianjin. If we do not resist, we will only bring about our own destruction. Wang bears full administrative responsibility. How can he sit idly by and watch the country and its territory fall into the hands of the enemy? Therefore, whether the resistance policy is determined to be implemented is the most important issue for China at present, and it is also the key to whether Wang resumes his post. Not only should we seek a solution to this problem to retain Wang, but we should also seek a way out for China's survival. As for the rumors that Wang's resignation is related to the National Political Participation Council, it is absolutely not true. Because the Political Participation Council is of great importance, we should gather opinions from all parties and seek a proper solution in order to implement it effectively in the future. Wang is very willing to accept opinions from all parties and is not discouraged by differences of opinion. I originally planned to go to Shanghai, but because government affairs are complicated, it is difficult to make the trip within a few days. I have previously submitted my resignation from the position of Chief of Railways to the Central Political Council. Although I have been comforted and retained, my intention to resign has not been dispelled. I am now waiting for someone to take over so that I can hand over the duties. I will continue to serve in the Central Government in the future and devote myself to party affairs." (8th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Retains All Ministers</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang sent a handwritten letter to Luo, delivered by Zeng Zhongming to Nanjing, and personally handed it over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 8th. The general idea of the letter was to describe the experience of going to Shanghai and the bitter feelings of having to resign this time. Luo has replied to Wang's letter of resignation, and has also entrusted Zeng to forward it. Wang instructed Zeng Zhongming to bring the letter to comfort and retain the ministers in Nanjing, hoping that they would settle down and work for the country. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Zeng Zhongming's Talk in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zeng Zhongming said, "Since Wang took office, his policy on resisting foreign insults has been to advocate active resistance. If we do not resist when the enemy arrives, and only rely on foreigners to seek survival, we will certainly not be spared. Therefore, in the past few months, in addition to using diplomatic means to deal with each other, he has been reorganizing the internal affairs day by day as preparation for resisting foreign insults and recovering lost territories. The greatest mission of his trip to Beiping last month was to discuss with Zhang Xueliang the measures to recover the lost territories of the Eastern Provinces, but he could not get his sympathy and returned without getting the main points. At that time, he was deeply stimulated by the inability to realize his proposals and had thoughts of retreating. However, he still hoped that he could realize and discover his conscience, and work together with the government to save the crisis. Unexpectedly, the enemy troops were approaching day by day, but he was still indecisive and perfunctory. He not only made no responsible statements, but also made endless requests to the government. At this point, he felt very helpless and believed that in this critical period, it was difficult to overcome the difficulties without immediately creating a new situation. Moreover, he felt that he bore a heavy responsibility and could not sit and wait for the country to perish and increase the crime of misleading the country. Therefore, he resolutely retreated, one to stimulate the conscience of those who bear the responsibility of defending the territory, and the other to promote all parties to quickly seek concrete measures to resist foreign insults. This was not an accidental passivity to shirk responsibility, nor was it for internal relations, but a positive expression of the overall interests and future. If the Central Government can quickly seek concrete measures for proper handling, Wang can return to Nanjing to assume responsibility for party affairs. If Zhang Xueliang can realize and actively resist, it is in line with Wang's original intention. On the contrary, even if Zhang resigns to apologize, Wang will never resume his post as a result."

<h3>Japanese Military Advocates Transplanting Rural Army to Northeast</h3>
<p>500 People as a Regiment, First Moving to Sanxing and Hailin</p>
<p>In Case of an Incident with Russia, They Can Be Conscripted at Any Time</p>
<p>▲ Chinese United News Agency, Tokyo, Eighth Day: The Japanese Cabinet has two views on immigration to the Northeast: one is from Finance Minister Takahashi, and the other is from the military. Takahashi said that the security of the Three Eastern Provinces cannot be maintained, and the Ministry of Finance cannot afford the large-scale immigration costs. The military refuted Finance Minister Takahashi, saying: "Immigration to Manchuria should not adopt an economic immigration policy, but a armed immigration policy. Ma Zhanshan has been defeated, and Li Du and Ding Chao have retreated into Mishan. Except for Wang Delin, there is no need to worry too much. Japan must send a large army to the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang to defend against Russia. In order to save military expenses, select rural troops to station there, and deploy military forces in the name of immigration. If the situation between Japan and Russia becomes critical, focus on military affairs. If the relationship between Japan and Russia eases, then focus on investigation work, preparing various facilities for the farmers who will follow. This can be said to be a win-win situation. If we wait for the restoration of security in Manchuria before implementing immigration, it will not be easy for a while." It is said that Takahashi has succumbed to the military. The general outline of the military's immigration plan is as follows: (1) Immigrants must be selected from volunteers among demobilized soldiers. (2) The number of people per regiment is limited to 500, and they will be selected twice a year. The number of immigration groups each time will depend on funding. (3) The immigration locations are set in the areas of Sanxing and Hailin, on the border between Korea and Russia. (4) The cost is 1,000 to 1,500 yuan per person per year, and it will be a continuous undertaking for ten years, with a total cost of 10 million to 15 million yuan, calculated on the basis of 10,000 immigrants. This is the first phase of the plan. It is uncertain whether this expenditure can be realized, and it must wait until the opening of the Diet next spring to see the results.</p>
<h3>England and France Widely Rumored that Italy Will Withdraw from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Rome Declares the Statement Inaccurate</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, Eighth Day: The news that Italy may withdraw from the League of Nations, published in the newspaper this morning, surprised people in London. The diplomatic correspondent of the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, said that Mussolini's concurrent position as Foreign Minister may be a prelude to Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations. There is a rumor in Paris that Italy, Germany, and Japan may all withdraw from the League of Nations soon. Yesterday, a Roman newspaper published this news in large font, without denying or criticizing it. The Italian Pan-Fascist Party has strict control over newspapers, but now it has disclosed this news, so it is generally believed to have important implications.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Rome, Eighth Day: Responsible parties here declared that there is no question of Italy withdrawing from the League of Nations. Former Foreign Minister Grandi advocated for moderate diplomacy. After Grandi recently resigned, the authorities here have earnestly stated that Italy's foreign policy will not change.</p>
<h3>Japan-Russia Fisheries Issue</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Makes Concessions to Japan</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, Eighth Day: In the Japan-Russia memorandum regarding the concession of fishing rights in the Soviet territorial waters of the north, Soviet Russia has taken a compromising attitude and will formally sign the agreement soon. This issue has been negotiated by the Japanese Ambassador to Soviet Russia, Hirota, and the Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Karakhan, for more than a year. Now that Hirota is about to return home soon, he is eager to complete it as soon as possible, and Soviet Russia has also responded with a compromising attitude, so it is easy to resolve.</p>
<h3>German Authorities Negotiate with Various Parties to Reorganize the Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Central and National Socialist Parties Tend Towards Cooperation</p>
<p>The Non-Partisan Nature of the Cabinet Will Not Be Shaken</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, Eighth Day: The current political situation in Germany is actually expected to avoid major changes. Several prominent leaders of the National Socialist Party seem likely to enter the cabinet, but the non-partisan nature of the current cabinet will not be shaken by this, and Chancellor von Papen will not give way to Hitler or other leaders of the National Socialist Party. Even the National Socialist Party members who enter the cabinet are not considered to be entering the cabinet as party representatives, but are leaping to the cabinet due to their political experience and the special trust of President Hindenburg. As for their names, nothing is known at the moment. It is expected that in the next few days, the government will negotiate with various parties in accordance with this policy. Chancellor von Papen returned to Beijing today, and the negotiations on reorganizing the cabinet should be completed before the end of this week. As for the Prussian government issue, it is also urgently waiting to be resolved. Observers of the political situation here predict that although the Central Party and the National Socialist Party have had fierce conflicts in the past few months, they can be expected to cooperate in the future. However, Hugenberg of the National People's Party does not seem to approve of the cooperation between these two parties, and his newspaper recently warned the National Socialist Party members that this kind of combination is quite dangerous.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, Eighth Day: Extremely reliable sources here now believe that after the reorganization of the German cabinet, the leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, may become Prime Minister, but it is unlikely that he will be given the post of Chancellor, because two of his party leaders, Strasser and Frick, are against his appointment as Chancellor, and President Hindenburg, Defense Minister Schleicher, and other important members of the current cabinet do not approve of giving him the highest position.</p>

<p>Bolivia's Attitude is Quite Strong</p>
<p>Opposes Interference from Neutral Countries</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, Eighth Day: The efforts of neutral countries to reconcile Bolivia and Paraguay have not met with any results. Paraguay has thanked Britain for its attention and stated that what Paraguay has adopted is purely a self-defense plan. Bolivia has not yet replied to Britain's note. According to news from the Paraguayan capital, the Bolivian President wrote to Congress, dissatisfied with the interference of neutral countries, saying that Bolivia has the right to the disputed land. Other than wanting to interfere, he does not understand what relationship the current situation has with other countries, as it does not hinder their rights or affect their future problems. Bolivia's attitude can be seen from this.</p>

<h3>France Holds Commemoration of the Merger of Brittany</h3>
<p>A Loud Noise Spoils the Fun</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Paris, Seventh Day: Today is the 400th anniversary of the merger of Brittany and France. A grand celebration was held in Rennes, but this morning, an incident of bombing the monument of Anne, Duchess of Brittany, spoiled the fun. Anne, Duchess of Brittany, was actually the mediator of the merger. After she married King Charles VIII and Louis XII of France, the two places merged to this day. After the incident, the police immediately conducted a thorough investigation, but the remnants of the bombing mechanism used in the case have not been found. The police speculate that this act must have been done by Brittany's autonomy activists, but so far they have not been able to obtain definite evidence.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Paris, Eighth Day: Fourteen people have been arrested in the Rennes bombing case of the Duchess of Brittany monument, all of whom are Brittany autonomy activists. The weekly magazine published by the party had recently written an article criticizing the monument as not being established.</p>

<h3>Germans Invent Artificial Porcelain Clay</h3>
<p>Dutch Invent Rubber Powder</p>
<p>Used for Paving Roads, Surpassing Asphalt</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Göttingen, 7th. Dr. Noll of the Mining Academy at the University of Göttingen has successfully experimented with artificial kaolin (i.e., porcelain raw material). It is estimated that the cost of mass production will be much lower than mining natural kaolin. The invention of artificial kaolin is a world first.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 8th. Today's Financial Times correspondent in Amsterdam detailed a new Dutch invention for converting rubber into a powder. The rubber enters the machine as a fluid, but exits as a dry powder. A little starch is added to prevent the powder particles from sticking together, so that the powder can be packed and shipped, which is cheaper than shipping the fluid, as the fluid contains 75% water. Rubber powder, when mixed with other materials for paving roads, is very suitable. According to the inventors, the cost of using this powder for road construction is slightly higher than using asphalt.</p>

<h3>New Village Governance Centered on Local Militias (Embracing)</h3>
<p>▲ Five Counties in Nanyang       ▲ Communist Bandits Eliminated</p>
<p>▲ Lawsuits Ceased and Prisons Empty      ▲ No One Picks Up Lost Articles</p>
<p>Someone went to the Nanyang area of Henan to investigate the situation of the local militias and returned to describe what he witnessed, recording:</p>
<p>Traveling west from Xuchang Station on the Pinghan Railway, passing through Xiangcheng County, Yexian County, and Fangcheng County, which have suffered greatly from banditry over the years, nearly 50-60% of the houses of the people have been destroyed or burned. The roadsides are full of poppys, the residents are overwhelmed by the harassment of bandits and the oppression of exorbitant taxes, and they flee in all directions. Fengxian County was once known for its wealth, but now as much as 8,000 hectares of good land is lying waste.</p>
<p>Once entering the boundary of Zhenping County in Nanyang, there are no poppies or destroyed or burned houses. It is as if entering another world. Peng Xitian from Zhenping, styled Wanting, once studied at the Huiwen Academy in Beijing and worked as a middle school teacher for many years. Later, he joined the Northwest Army headquarters and became proficient in military training, eventually rising to the position of Secretary-General of the Northwest Frontier Defense Commissioner's Office. In the 16th year of the Republic, he returned home on leave. At that time, banditry in Zhenping was rampant. Two bandit representatives came to his village to demand firearms, saying that if they were not given, they would burn and kill immediately. Peng was enraged, killed the two representatives, gathered strong men, and arranged defenses, preventing the bandits from succeeding. From then on, the villagers were inspired to know how to defend themselves. Before long, Peng returned to the Northwest Army to fight. The defense matters were entrusted to the villagers, but the defense became lax, and the bandits became rampant again. The villagers were helpless and urged Peng to take up the post of President of the Henan Village Governance Academy. Peng was devoted to promoting village governance. In the 18th year of the Republic, he returned to Zhenping. The people of the county wept and begged him not to go out again. Peng agreed, but insisted that those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength. From then on, Zhenping village governance officially began.</p>
<p>At that time, Zhenping had already followed orders to implement self-government, dividing the county into several districts, each with an office. Peng first ordered each district to conduct a comprehensive census. Based on the results of the census, he recruited 1,800 strong men during the agricultural slack season, organized them into a mixed regiment, and conducted military training for four months, following the methods of the Northwest Army, while also providing civic education, focusing on spiritual cultivation. Internal and external venues were divided into classes for training. Those who were illiterate were taught to read. Once they were literate, they were instructed to read books. If there was a bandit alert in the county, they were led to suppress it. After class, they engaged in work, such as building roads and planting trees, implementing Tao Xingzhi's "Learning and Doing are One" principle. All county, town, and village roads in Zhenping are wide, flat, and well-maintained. Trees are planted along the roads, and none are withered. In the spring of this year alone, trees were planted in the public forests, totaling more than 1.2 million trees.</p>
<p>After the four-month training period for these 1,800 men was completed, they were discharged and new recruits were enlisted. Currently, five regiments have completed training, totaling 8,000-9,000 men. All regiment members, after receiving training, are assembled once a month on the 1st and 15th of each month in the first year, and in addition to training, they are assigned work. In the second year, they are assembled once a month. In the third year, they are assembled once a year. In the first year, they are not allowed to leave the village. In the second year, they can leave the village after applying for leave. In the third year, they are free to leave the village. Firearms and clothing are provided by the public. On the days of training, meals are provided, and each person is given four strings of pocket money per month, equivalent to about one silver dollar.</p>
<p>Where does this funding come from? Peng ordered each mu to pay two sheng of wheat per year, but those with less than five mu are exempt. Those with more land pay more according to a progressive scale. This wheat is used partly to feed the regiment members and partly sold to cover all expenses. If there is a surplus, the collection will be reduced next year, adopting the principle of determining income based on expenses. Peng advised the villagers that all national taxes should be paid without delay, but regarding exorbitant taxes, he agreed with the county magistrate that they should not be used to harass the people. The people loved and respected him, and whether literate or illiterate, they all called him "Mr. Peng" and obeyed his orders carefully. County Magistrate Qin and Peng were on very good terms. Peng ordered the establishment of mediation committees in each village. If there was a dispute among the people, it would be mediated by the committee. If the mediation failed, it would be taken to the district, and if it still failed, it would be taken to the county, as both the district and the county had committees. The committee members were filled by respected figures in the locality. From January of the 20th year of the Republic to June of the 21st year of the Republic, for a year and a half, the county government did not receive a single lawsuit, and the county prison had no criminals. The investigator went in July and described what he saw in this way. In the entire Zhenping County, no one picked up lost articles. A certain director of the Xichuan Education Bureau took his wife to Zhenping. After their carriage, there was a box containing gold jewelry. They lost it on the way. When they realized it, they returned to look for it and reported it to the district office. Just as they were about to start searching, a villager brought the box, having picked it up and not knowing the owner, so he reported it to the district office. This is a recent fact.</p>
<p>The Nanyang area is famous for weaving silk, called Nanyang silk. Zhenping has 20,000 looms. Peng is planning to improve them and is in the process of deliberation. Peng is very hardworking. He writes a diary in regular script every day, and for more than ten years, there has not been a day when he has been negligent. However, he is inarticulate and not good at speaking, and it is not easy to get along with him.</p>
<p>Zhenping County has a population of more than 300,000, with more than 10,000 guns and 8,000-9,000 regiment members, enough to defend themselves. Therefore, neighboring counties such as Nanyang, Nanzhao, Xinye, and Neixiang have begun to imitate them, with Neixiang being the most powerful. Bie Tingfang from Neixiang, styled Xiangji, and Peng created local militias one after another. Their training and all their work are roughly similar. The villagers respect him as "Commander Bie." There are more than 10,000 regiment members. Other counties mostly call it that. Telephones are installed between counties and between villages to communicate information and unite for self-defense. Bandits dare not commit crimes. Those who do are severely wounded and leave. The Communist Party has repeatedly tried to pass through western Henan from western Hubei and head north to Guanzhong and Shaanxi, but they are blocked by the united belt of local militias hundreds of miles long and cannot pass. Last year, He Long occupied Xichuan, but Peng and Bie jointly drove him away.</p>
<p>Liu Zhi, Chairman of Henan Province, praised their achievements and awarded them millions of rounds of bullets. The government ordered Liu Zhenhua to be stationed in Nanyang and establish local militia cadres. Following the example of the Village Governance Academy, they established joint normal schools in each county to train local militia instructors and village governance promoters, planning to expand from these five counties to 23 counties.</p>
<p>The combination of military force and the people solves all internal and external problems. I heard these words before, but now I see them for the first time.</p>
<h3>Liu Xuegu, Leader of the Plainclothes Team Disturbing Tianjin, Arrested</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Army Supplying Arms and Ammunition to Disrupt Public Order</p>
<p>▲ Special Team Members Disguised Themselves to Capture Liu</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Li Jichun, the leader of the plainclothes team who disturbed Tianjin last winter and acted as a traitor, fled to Dalian under Japanese protection after his failure due to intense pursuit. After Li left Tianjin, he still entrusted his chief of staff, Liu Xuegu, to plot against Tianjin. On the 17th of last month, when the Japanese army invaded Rehe, Liu took the opportunity to become active. He contacted the Japanese army headquarters stationed in Tianjin and resorted to the same old trick, recruiting a plainclothes team. The Japanese army headquarters supplied them with arms, ammunition, and military pay. The Public Security Bureau's special team then sent capable detectives disguised as members of the plainclothes team. Liu did not know, and the special team was fully aware of Liu's every move. At 2:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, the sky was still dark, and the lights in the Japanese concession suddenly went out for about half an hour before coming back on. People thought the power lines were damaged and did not pay much attention since it was late at night. Little did they know that when the lights went out, ten trucks had driven out of the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple and stopped at Shianli on Suma Street, unloading dozens of wooden crates and transporting them into Liu Xuegu's residence at number 4. After investigation, it was found that there were 300 Mauser pistols, 20 boxes of ammunition, and 10 boxes of hand grenades. The Japanese believed that their actions were secret, but they had been detected by the Public Security Bureau. Bureau Chief Wang Yimin, upon receiving the report, immediately issued an order on the 4th to send the second and third special teams to arrest the troublemakers and bring them to justice for interrogation. After receiving the order, the special team sent all its members disguised as beggars, rickshaw pullers, peddlers, etc., and spread them around Shianli. When Liu walked out at around 11:00 AM on the 5th, looking very relaxed, he was immediately dragged onto a car by the disguised special team members as soon as he left the alley, and his mouth was stuffed with cotton to prevent him from shouting. The car drove directly into the Public Security Bureau. Bureau Chief Wang Yimin interrogated him personally in the office on the front floor, dismissing everyone else. The bureau has not yet released his confession. At 4:00 PM, Bureau Chief Wang, along with Sun Zhenhua, the leader of the second special team, and more than a dozen team members, escorted the suspect to Peiping to be handed over to the Pacification Commissioner's Office for interrogation.

<h3>The Bitter Struggle of Zheng Guilin's Righteous Army in Jinxi</h3>
<p>▲ Actively Operating Using the Green Fields as Cover</p>
<p>▲ But Lacking Bullets, They Rely on Hand-to-Hand Combat</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: A person from Suizhong said that recently, the righteous armies in various parts of the Northeast have been actively operating, taking advantage of the green fields, and have been in contact with each other. In the Jinxi, Suizhong, and Xingcheng areas, it is the National Salvation Army led by Zheng Guilin, totaling more than 10,000 cavalry and infantry, fully armed. This army has fought twelve major and minor battles in the past two months. Xingcheng was once occupied by this army, but due to a lack of ammunition supplies, it could not be held for long. This is also the main reason why the righteous armies cannot develop. Zheng's army is even more in dire need of bullets. Recently, each person has no more than 30 bullets left, and each person uses no more than 10 bullets in each battle. Moreover, the combat equipment is not sophisticated, with no machine guns or artillery, but the Japanese army still fears them. This is only due to their spirit of combat, resisting new-style weapons with their bodies. Their spirit of sacrifice is admirable. The current combat strategy adopted by the righteous armies is to disrupt the Japanese army and the puppet army's transportation, economy, and administration. Regarding transportation, Zheng's forces destroyed more than 20 li of railway tracks in Huangdigou, Haling and Gaoling on July 18th and 19th. They originally planned to destroy the railway bridges along the way, but the planned was unrealized due to the exhaustion of explosives. The righteous army's destruction of the railway is to make the Japanese armored trains ineffective. In addition, telephones in the surrounding villages were also destroyed by the righteous armies, so that the puppet army could not communicate. Regarding administration, wherever the righteous armies go, if the puppet police and security teams want to abandon their rebellion and return to the right path, they are treated equally. If there is resistance, force is used to suppress them. In addition to confiscating weapons, they are severely punished. Regarding the economy, at present, puppet officials dare not go to the surrounding villages to collect taxes. Even if they do, the local residents have already dispersed. The puppet regime's economy has been affected to some extent. On July 20th, the Japanese army set out in eight routes to encircle Zheng's righteous army. Those starting from the vanguard launched attacks in four directions: towards Jiumentai, Shimen, Pingying, and Malugou. Those starting from Huangdi launched attacks in three directions: towards Matigou, Yimahe, and Henghezi. Those starting from Suizhong expected to attack Shunshanbao and Heishanling. With such an encirclement, the Japanese army intended to annihilate Zheng's forces in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, Zheng's forces took advantage of the mountain's ruggedness and surrounded the Japanese army in the Yanmagou area. Both sides fought fiercely, and as a result, 96 Japanese soldiers were killed, loaded into 48 hemp bags and transported away. The number of those injured and dying along the way is not included. On July 29th and 30th, Zheng's forces made contact with the Japanese army in the Huangdi area northwest of Suizhong. Zhang Zijing, the chief of the Suizhong Public Security Bureau, also led puppet police to assist in the battle. The righteous armies fought bravely, resorting to hand-to-hand combat after running out of ammunition. As a result, more than 80 enemies were killed, more than 70 guns were seized, and three cannons were seized. This cannon is the only one left in Zheng's forces. More than 20 others escaped. Although the righteous army lacks ammunition, its combat experience and courageous spirit are enough to resist the Japanese army. On the 2nd of this month, the righteous armies occupying the Lianshan Station and Huludao were also Zhang Baiqiu's cavalry brigade of Zheng's forces, totaling more than 400 people. As for those recently active in Shenyang, they are Li Yunqing's 18th unit and Song Tianxiang's 19th unit of Zheng's forces. Because Song's subordinates are all students who have not yet graduated from the 11th class of the Baoding Military Academy, they are very brave in combat. The two routes have a total of more than 1,000 people, and the cavalry has more than 400 people, a very strong force. Therefore, they have also been successful in recent days. If the people of the country provide them with assistance, it will be difficult for the Japanese army to defeat the Jinxi area during these months of green fields in July and August.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Water Level in Shandong Has Fallen Slightly</h3>
<p>▲ Dama Family Has Turned Danger into Safety</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Today, the water level of the Yellow River in the upper, middle, and lower reaches has fallen. In the middle reaches, the water level at Luokou, north of the city, has fallen 4.4 gongcun, equivalent to 1 chi and 3.2 cun on the municipal scale, and the water level is 29.66 meters, equivalent to 8 zhang, 8 chi, and 9.8 cun on the municipal scale. In the lower reaches, the water level at the dangerous Gongdama Family has fallen 3.4 gongcun, but the potential danger has not eased. This morning, the 10th Dama again , and the river workers and soldiers of the 59th Brigade stationed in Lijin have been desperately digging out green material overnight in order to make. Today, more troops were added to dig, and the embankment in front of the segmented area is still collapsing. At 4:00 PM, the River Affairs Bureau received a long-distance call from Dama Family saying that since the northeast wind started this morning, the current has shifted south (Dama Family is on the north bank) and has gradually become stable. The number of people rescuing the danger has increased, and the addition of soldiers from the regiment to dig material is sufficient for use. At present, it can be guaranteed that there is no danger. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, left Jinan last night and arrived at Dama Family this afternoon to supervise the rescue and repair work. Yesterday, the water level near Luokou was huge, and the No. 2 Dam in Xiaoluzhuang was leaking 2 cun of water, and the situation was quite dangerous. The other dams were leaking 2-3 chi of water. Today, the water level has fallen, and the danger has been turned into safety. The provincial capital is safe. The embankment of the No. 9 Dam in Laoxuzhuang was brushed by the current, the water submerged and stabilized. (August 7th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Establish Large Armament Factory in Northeast China</h3>
<p>▲ Transformed from the Shenyang Arsenal</p>
<p>▲ Exclusively Accommodating Unemployed Japanese Workers</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied our Northeast on September 18th, the Shenyang Arsenal, a domestic enterprise, has also been occupied by the Japanese. The factory covers thousands of acres, and the machinery and equipment are worth 70 million yuan in national currency. The Japanese have now decided to transform the factory into a large armament factory, nominally called the "Japanese-Manchu Jointly Operated Armament Factory." In fact, it is operated by the Japanese. The Japanese side has now appointed Mr. Yoshida, advisor to the Kwantung Army, as the director of the factory and has begun preparing for the opening. It is scheduled to open on August 10th. A large number of armament technicians have been shipped from Japan. The factory also plans to recruit general unemployed workers from Japan as employees, with the number of workers provisionally set at 20,000. (August 5th)</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu's Letter to Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>▲ Lofty Talk About Confucianism and Promotion of National Policy</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Wu Peifu sent a letter to Chiang Kai-shek yesterday, advocating for the rapid establishment of national policy and the promulgation of a constitution. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>I believe that natural disasters are not to be feared, but man-made disasters are worrisome; national difficulties are not to be overcome, but the death of the national spirit is to be feared. There has never been a case where internal affairs were not properly managed and yet diplomacy could be discussed, nor a case where the national soul was not revitalized and yet popular sentiment could be discussed. Alas, the national situation is precarious, and the people's morals are shallow. Since ancient times, there has never been a situation worse than today. The superiors have no guiding principles, and the inferiors have no laws to abide by. The fundamental principles have fallen to the ground, and commands are not followed. Whose fault is this? Since the revolution, politics has lost its foundation, and education has lost its direction. Those who are unlearned and unskilled, blindly follow the trends of the times, and use the banner of reform, know only destruction and not construction, imitate the superficiality of freedom, seek only private interests, and disregard public interests. They criticize morality as decadence and slander ethics as pedantry. As a result, heresies and atrocities arise in support, and arrogant and reckless youths act arbitrarily, transgressing boundaries, which is worse than floods and wild beasts. Gradually, the government's credibility has declined, and the reputation of China has gone bankrupt. When brewing the revolution, there was only fear that the youth would not be willing to act, and it was necessary to encourage them. Once the political situation changed, the bad habits had become deeply ingrained, and the raging tide could not be stemmed. It was only then that they regretted the miscalculation of teaching monkeys to climb trees and hated that it was too late to mend the fold after the sheep was lost. Our country, which has been a civilized and advanced nation for thousands of years, has been slandered as an unorganized country and regarded as a semi-civilized nation. Is this not a great shame and humiliation? The world has no immoral civilization, and no society without order. Ethics is the mother of social etiquette, and morality has no distinction between East and West, new and old. A person without etiquette, a person without education, what distinguishes them from beasts? Therefore, the sages were concerned about it and taught them human relations: fathers and sons should be close, rulers and subjects should have righteousness, husbands and wives should be different, elders and juniors should have order, and friends should be trustworthy. The Three Bonds, Five Constants, Eight Virtues, and Nine Classics are all manifestations of morality and the spirit of ethics. Confucius answered Duke Jing of Qi's question about government by saying, "Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject be a subject, the father be a father, and the son be a son." Mencius said, "If human relations are clear above, the common people will be close below. Everyone loves their parents and respects their elders, and the world will be at peace." When the world is in order, the proper relationships will be maintained; when there is no order, the proper relationships will be ruined. The rise and fall of morality, the order and chaos of the country, all depend on this. Husband and wife must be married before there are parents and children. Families are formed through brothers. From that, by extension, all human relationships, speaking vertically, the respect for superiors and inferiors are the duty of ruler and subject. Speaking horizontally, the gathering of categories and separation of groups are the duties of friends. Because of this, society is established. The ancients created characters, all with purpose. The ruler is the head of the group, and sheep are animals that are good at gathering, so the character for group follows sheep. Sheep must have shepherds, so the ruler has the duty of shepherding the people. Also, the character for ruler follows Yin and kou. Yin means elder, and kou means issuing orders and commands. In ancient times, the words ruler and subject were used very broadly, not specifically referring to those in the court. Even if it is said that the republic has sovereignty in the people, how can we abolish the group principles of the nation just because of the abolishment of one principle. Besides, names, distinctions, and responsibilities are related. If this is disrupted, how can there be a country? For a country in heaven and earth, there must be standing up with it, and a person who does not learn etiquette cannot stand up. All laws and punishments can only restrain the person and body. Not as good as how etiquette and teaching can deeply influence people's hearts, therefore, overcoming oneself and returning to propriety is the practical work of self-cultivation. Moral rectitude is the great use of managing the country. The sages made etiquette as a means of governance, to clarify right and wrong, distinguish ranks, determine names, and unify the people's will. If one cannot abide by etiquette, how can one hope to abide by the law? It is unreasonable to talk about the rule of law while disregarding etiquette. And etiquette is principle, it is practice, the public principle of humanity, and the common practice for the world. Taking the principle of Heaven as the standard, conforming to the laws of nature, is the essence of this principle. If one wants to tear off crowns and destroy and confuse the order of superiors and inferiors for pleasure, then one will lead the world to be like beasts. Therefore, the lack of etiquette for a day is the key to managing the world. If we reject these things, what else can we use to regulate people's hearts and maintain principles? Some say that China's emphasis on etiquette and concession has led to its decline. This is a big mistake. It must be understood that etiquette is to regulate things, so as to stop strife and quell chaos, not to teach people to retreat and be cowardly in the face of things. Especially like the New Testament in Christianity that says, "If someone strikes you on the left cheek, offer them the right cheek as well." The degree of concession is almost greater. Why is the Christian nation prosperous? It is only because their teachings are based on morality, emphasize the creation of personality. Doing one's best is private virtue, treating others is public virtue. From small to the family and large to the nation, the affairs are internal within the family and external affairs, there is something to do with courtesy. A person who is not content to be wild and lacking etiquette will cause the etiquette to fail. It is clear that when etiquette has been abolished, the country is not a country. It is hoped that the government will appreciate that the order of Heaven cannot be lost and that the people's principles cannot be abandoned. It should quickly establish national policy, promulgate a constitution, reorganize ethical principles, treat them as natural laws, teach them from above and learn them from below. Anyone who is disloyal, unfilial, unfriendly, disobedient, untrustworthy, or unjust should be severely punished. The court should not be afraid, and the villages should despise them. In this way, the declining customs can be restored, and the decadent customs can be changed. If respect is given to etiquette and morality, ethics will prosper, order will be strict, and the principles will be righteous. Internally, it will enable the people to have something to follow and be content with their status, restoring the traditional spirit of our nation. Externally, it will enable friendly nations to have something to admire and respect, so as to promote advanced civilization and avoid being despised by the great powers. In order to achieve construction, there is nothing more important than this. In order to achieve innovation, there is nothing more urgent than this. The way to cultivate the foundation of the country, deepen the morality of the people, eliminate the source of chaos, and wash away national humiliation is nothing more than this. As a person in opposition, Peifu does not want to make too many comments on politics, but he is mindful of his responsibility for the rise and fall of the country and fears the consequences of its overthrow. I dare to offer my humble opinion, and I hope you will not regard it as irrelevant.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Army: Remnants Recover Xinfeng</h3>
<p>▲ Zhu De's Remaining Forces Flee Towards the East Bank</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Zhu De's communist bandit forces in southern Jiangxi, after failing to invade northern Guangdong, retreated to Xinfeng. Subsequently, due to Xinfeng being indefensible, they led the main force to retreat into Anyuan and Huichang. Yu Hanmou's First Column of the Cantonese Army then decided to attack. Ye Zhao's Second Division was responsible for the central route, while Li Zhenqiu's First Division provided flanking support from Nankang, responsible for the left flank. The Independent Third Division of the Second Column, led by Li Hanhun, was responsible for the right flank, advancing from Nanxiong along the Xintian Jiudu River to prevent the communist bandits in Xinfeng from fleeing south. With the deployment complete, a general mobilization was launched on July 27th. Ye's division on the central route reached the northeast gate of Xinfeng at noon on the 31st. Li's division on the left flank also searched for remaining bandits, covering the central route's advance. At this time, upon hearing the news, most of the communist bandits in Xinfeng withdrew from the city, only sending a small force to Datang to resist the right flank of the Cantonese Army, in order to prevent encirclement. Therefore, only the right flank engaged with the bandits. After the main force had retreated, the small force at Datang also hastily withdrew with the main force. In the afternoon of the same day, Ye's division entered the city of Xinfeng. The city was devastated after several major battles, with reactionary slogans of the communist bandits plastered all over the streets. Currently, the Cantonese Army is searching for remaining bandits and deploying troops for guard duty in Wangfu, Daxiaowo, Xintian, and other places. Ye's division reported by telegram yesterday, stating: "Our division recaptured the city of Xinfeng to the east. Several thousand bandits fled towards the east bank on the evenings of the 30th and 31st. The eastern gate bridge of Xinfeng was burned down by the bandits, preventing pursuit. The division headquarters and the three regiments of Ye (Gengchang), Li (Chonggang), and Deng (Qichang) are stationed inside the northeast city gate. Division Commander Li Zhenqiu will lead the regiments of the First Division to arrive today," and so on. Furthermore, Deputy Division Commander Li Jiang of the Independent Third Division telegraphed: "On the 30th, our Second Column advanced to the Xiaoche Wanlong area. The communist bandit covering force offered slight resistance in Xiaoche before fleeing towards Datang Anxi. The main force of the communist bandits is now fleeing towards the Anxi Anyuan area. All the communist bandits in Xinfeng retreated to Anxi on the 31st. Currently, there are no traces of bandits on both sides of the Xinfeng West River. Our First Column entered and occupied Xinfeng at noon today. This division will return to Wanlong from (blank) this afternoon," and so on. It is understood that the Independent Third Division returned to Wanlong because it was feared that there were still hidden bandits in the San Nan area on the right flank. Therefore, it was transferred back to await further orders, as the Second Column still had to take care of the San Nan area and could not join the First Column in Xinfeng. According to a report from the air squadron on the 3rd, a small number of local bandits are still hiding in the mountains near Nankang and Dajiang. As for the main force of the communist bandits in Xinfeng, after retreating towards Anyuan, they continued to retreat to their old nest in Huichang. As for the military operations on the Dongjiang front, they were also launched simultaneously. Army Commander Li Yangjing rushed to the front on the 29th to supervise the various units stationed in Xingning, Lianping, Heping, and Pingyuan, and will directly enter Xunwu to encircle and suppress the bandits. Li's unit has the Seventh and Eighth Divisions of the Third Army and the Independent First and Second Divisions, plus an Independent Brigade, which will be organized into the Third Column, entering Jiangxi from Dongjiang and advancing towards Huichang for suppression.

<h3>Severe Wind and Rain Disaster in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>▲ 1,800 Homeless Refugees Due to Collapsed Houses in Guangzhou for Days</p>
<p>▲ Chao Shan, Shunde, Kaiping, and Nanhai All Experienced Flooding</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the wind and rain disaster in this city on the evening of July 29th, although the floodwater in the streets outside the city has gradually receded in recent days, the old houses in the disaster areas have continued to collapse after the foundation of the walls have been washed away by rainwater. According to investigations, about 70% of the houses on Tianguan Lane have collapsed, and most of the residents are homeless and huddling on the roadside, which is very pitiful. As of the 2nd, the water was still about a foot deep in places such as Dongguan Railway Terminal, Yuexiu Lower Street, Yongsheng Street, Dongguan Garrison, and Qizheng Lower Street. Fortunately, the weather has cleared up since the 2nd, and it is expected that the accumulated water will disappear in a day or two. It is reported that various charitable organizations have taken in more than 1,800 refugees near the Northeast Gate in recent days. As for the collapsed houses, according to statistics on the 31st, there were 2 houses in Haoxian Street, 24 in Tianguan Lane, 6 in Tianguan Lane Qiyuan Alley, 4 in Bangui Lane, and 1 in Dakeng Canal in the Xiaobei Branch Bureau.

In the Dadong Branch Bureau, there were 26 houses in Yuexiu Lower Street, 6 in Beihang Street, and 6 in Xianxianggang. In the Yonghan Branch Bureau, half a house collapsed in Yangzhong Street, and 1 house collapsed in each of Liantang Street and Guangxiao Street. More than 10 houses collapsed in Hongsheng Street, Danggan Alley, Fuquan Alley, Dashi Alley, Shutong Alley, and Xihua Second Alley, injuring several people. On August 1st, there were still houses collapsing in Qinglong Lane, Dongchuan Road, and Henan. In recent days, the convenience hospital rescue team rescued more than 700 elderly people in the Dongguan Hui Lao Yuan and distributed them to various charity homes for shelter, and collected 88 bodies of drowned elderly women and 2 bodies of children in the hospital. There were more than 200 refugees next to the Fazheng Road, with no place to stay and hungry all day long. Fortunately, various charitable organizations sent bread to satisfy their hunger. On the same day, various charitable organizations held a meeting at the Ai Chong Shantang to discuss the relief of wind and rain victims in the city, and decided to allocate huge sums of money from the surplus funds of the Shanghai War Refugees Fundraising Association to handle relief, and requested the authorities to dredge the old Six Vein Canal as soon as possible to prevent future flooding. The provincial and municipal governments also held a meeting on the afternoon of the 1st to discuss the main points: (1) How should the victims of this disaster be resettled? (2) Flood prevention plan. The above is a glimpse of the disaster situation in Guangzhou City. As for other places outside the city, they also suffered from strong winds, rain and flooding at the same time. In Daliang City, Shunde County, 3 houses collapsed in Nanmen Bi Street and Ma Di Alley during the wind and rain on the evening of the 29th, drowning more than 30 people. During the wind and rain on the 28th and 29th, Kaiping and Shantou were flooded in the urban areas, and ships and trains were suspended, resulting in heavy losses. The water level of the East River has risen sharply by more than 18 feet in recent days due to heavy rain upstream. The river surface in Boluo Shilong downstream is turbulent, and both banks have been flooded. Fifteen boats were overturned the day before yesterday. The water level of the West River in Foshan Xiliao has risen by more than 2 feet. Upstream, such as Wuzhou, the water level has risen by 14 or 15 feet. On the other hand, the mountain torrents in the North River are 4 or 5 feet above the ground. In the northern part of Panyu County, such as Gaotang, Jiangcun, and Shijing, there were still 3 or 4 feet of floodwater on the 30th, and boats could be rowed on the rice fields. The roadbeds of the highways from Guangzhou to Panyu Taiping City and Huaxian were washed away by water. The roadbeds of the Nanhang and Tangmei stations of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway were washed out by rainwater on the evening of the 29th. On the 30th, the Guangdong-Hong Kong express and slow trains were suspended. Fortunately, the Railway Bureau quickly sent personnel to repair them, and the repairs were completed on the 31st. The trains resumed normal operations the next day. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3>Natural and Man-Made Disasters in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>▲ The Severity of Cholera is Unprecedented in Recent Years</p>
<p>▲ Female Bandit "Miss Wan" in Dingyuan is Rampant</p>
<p>Bengbu Communication: Disasters occur frequently in northern Anhui, which has injured the local vitality and withered the people's livelihood. Recently, cholera, drought, locusts, and accumulated bandits have caused harm to each other, and the people feel even more hardship. The situation of various disasters is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Drought: Since the beginning of summer in northern Anhui, rainfall has been scarce. When the dog days arrive, the weather is very hot. The highest temperature in the room has risen to 105 degrees Fahrenheit, causing pedestrians on the road to faint from time to time. Since the beginning of last month to today, more than 30 days have passed without a drop of rain, and northern Anhui has developed into a major drought. Many autumn crops in the fields have died from drought, and it is expected that there will be no hope for the autumn harvest.</p>
<p>▲ Locust Plague: Last year's massive flooding caused many fish and shrimp to lay eggs. This summer's long drought has caused the eggs to hatch into locusts. The reproduction is frequent and the growth is rapid. In recent days, swarms of locusts fill the sky, millions of them, flying south with the wind. Those that fall in the fields gnaw on the seedlings of sorghum until they are full. Most of the un-drought-stricken crops have been gnawed away by the locusts, so farmers are extremely anxious, saying that the situation will develop into a lean year.</p>
<p>▲ Cholera: The weather is extremely hot and cholera is prevalent. Since the discovery in Bengbu last month, nearly 2,000 people have been infected and more than 900 have died, mostly the poor and children. Now cholera is spreading rapidly. Northern Anhui, such as Fuyang, Huoqiu, Bo County, Su County, Mengcheng, Shou County, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Fengyang, Wuhe, and Chu Yi, is widely spreading, with successive deaths. Even the coffins have been sold out, and the later dead have no coffins to be buried. The deaths of the whole family are not uncommon. The severity of cholera is unprecedented in recent years. The Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee has recently sent personnel with a large number of cholera vaccines to various counties to carry out epidemic prevention and vaccination work, saving many people. ▲ Banditry: There have been many bandits in northern Anhui over the years. Although they have been repeatedly suppressed by government troops and local militias, they flee to other places when suppressed in one. The bandits come after the soldiers leave, and they have not been completely eliminated. Moreover, there are communist party members manipulating and directing the bandits, so the burning, killing, raping, and looting are very cruel. After a large group of red bandits in Huoqiu were defeated by Xu Tingyao's Fourth Division last month, they have been broken up into smaller groups and scattered in the countryside. They have not been completely eliminated for a while. Dagudui Ji in the second district of Huodong Shou County was recently attacked and looted by bandit leaders Cao Wuqi and Zheng Ju, who led more than 200 bandits. In northern Dingyuan, a female bandit leader, Miss Wan, has recently led more than 300 people to rampage near Luqiao, and her power is very rampant. Moreover, there is an autumn gauze account to hide her, so the government troops cannot advance to suppress them. In the areas of Chu Yi, Si County, and Lai An, the bandits are everywhere, and the people are suffering greatly. (August 6th)</p>
<h3>New Defense Line of Red Bandits on the Border of Jiangxi and Fujian</h3>
<p>▲ The 19th Route Army Has Been Stationed in Yan Yong</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: The military authorities decided to gather a large army to besiege the various red bandit forces in Fujian and Jiangxi. It is now confirmed that the two divisions of Shen Guanghan and Qu Shounian of the 19th Route Army, who are responsible for suppressing the bandits on the Fujian border, have advanced to Shizhong, Yongfu, and Longtan in Longyan, and Fushi and Kanshi in Yongding. It has been decided to attack the front of Longyan with the Shen Division and the side of Longyan with the Qu Division, using a steady strategy of advancing step by step on the entire front to prevent the cunning plan of the red bandits to encircle and intercept. As for the red bandits, most of them have fled back to their old nest between Jiangxi and western Fujian, and have designated Changting, Ninghua, Liancheng, Longyan, Shicheng, Ruijin, Ningdu, and Yudu as special military regions in Fujian and Jiangxi, with Liancheng and Longyan as the first defense line in western Fujian, Ninghua and Changting as the second defense line, Ningdu and Yudu as the first defense line in southern Jiangxi, and Shicheng and Ruijin as the second defense line. Luo Binghui is responsible for the western Fujian front, resisting the 19th Route Army, and Lin Biao is responsible for the southern Jiangxi front, resisting Chen Cheng's army. Furthermore, the bandit troops directly under Zhu Mao are called elite troops and are concentrated in Changting and Ruijin, using the inner line warfare method to make a final struggle. They are now deploying defensive projects step by step, and have installed the long-distance telephone line, which was captured from Zhang Zhen's division in Zhangzhou, between Changting and Ruijin to transmit news between Fujian and Jiangxi. The militia of the counties in western Fujian are considered to be anti-communist elements in the local area, familiar with the terrain, and brave in combat, so they plan to launch a fierce attack on the militia in the three counties of Longyan, Yongding, and Liancheng before the National Army's general offensive, hoping to eliminate their strength. However, after the two divisions of Shen and Qu of the 19th Army were stationed in the two counties of Yanyang, they have provided support for the militia, so the bandits will not easily succeed.

<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Various Chambers of Commerce Discuss Business Tax: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to make up for the deficit in the provincial treasury, is urgently seeking to increase revenue. It has resolved to implement the business tax and organize it. Although the Provincial Federation of Commerce has repeatedly appealed for exemption, it has not been possible to cancel it due to limited financial resources. Subsequently, the Federation of Commerce proposed six opinions on the business tax for the 21st year: (1) The business tax rate originally set at one per thousand will be increased to two per thousand; the one originally set at two per thousand will be increased to four per thousand; the one originally set at five per thousand and ten per thousand will remain the same; the whole industry will still be levied at half. The above measures will be implemented from July 1st. (2) The gold and silver industry should be regarded as a manufacturing industry and re-listed as the amount of capital to calculate the levy. (3) The business tax will be handled by the finance bureau of each county, and if there is no finance bureau, it will be handled by the county. (4) Each quarter's tax revenue will be collected in the first month of each quarter. If the store closes midway, the tax can be deducted and refunded according to the date. (5) The collection matters will be handled by one or two responsible persons from the local chamber of commerce. (6) The Provincial Federation will notify the chambers of commerce in each county and district to persuade local stores to declare the business tax number in accordance with the regulations, and convene a meeting to announce the intentions of cooperation in the old government to achieve results. The chairman of this county's Chamber of Commerce, Cai Zhongyu, and Zhang Tianmin of Tianma Mountain Chamber of Commerce, were entrusted by the Provincial Federation to convene the chambers of commerce of the counties under the old Songfu government to meet at the Songjiang Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 pm on the 8th. Representatives from the chambers of commerce of Songjiang, Sijing, Tinglin, Zhujing, Tianma Mountain, Nanhui, Qingpu, Minhang, Qibao, Fengjing, etc. attended. The convener Cai Zhongyu and Zhang Tianmin reported the reasons for the convocation, and then publicly elected Yang Zhimin as the chairman to discuss matters: (1) How should the six opinions of the Provincial Federation of Commerce be expressed? It was resolved that everyone unanimously agreed with pain and asked the Provincial Federation of Commerce to implement the six claims, but the provincial tax rate will not be recognized. (2) Those who have a tooth post or have paid local donations should pay the business tax. It was resolved that it was recommended that the Provincial Federation of Commerce request to check the original proposal and strive for the provincial hall. (3) A rating committee should be organized before the business tax is levied. It was resolved and passed, and the association recommended that the Provincial Federation of Commerce negotiate with the Provincial Hall. (4) If the tax collection agency needs to consult the merchant's account books, it should first inform the local chamber of commerce and forward it to the store to send the account books to the meeting for inspection. It was resolved and passed, and the association recommended that the Provincial Federation of Commerce negotiate with the Provincial Hall.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>▲ It is not easy to solve the car license dispute. The Wu County Education Bureau added 500 tricycle licenses to compensate for the accumulated education fees last month, and charged a deposit of 160 yuan for each license, totaling 80,000, to clear the accumulated education fees. This deposit has been paid to the Education Bureau by the Tricycle Rental Industry Association. On the one hand, the county government reported to the Education and Construction Halls for record, and the Education Hall has instructed to approve it, but the Construction Hall has not yet approved it, so the Construction Bureau has not been able to issue the licenses. As for the car dealers, they pushed this license to each member, which caused opposition from non-members. The county party department failed to mediate. Now the Car Association has submitted a request to the Education Bureau to urge the issuance of the license, and the non-member side has also submitted a request to the Education Bureau to postpone the issuance of the license. Therefore, the Education Bureau feels it is difficult and has submitted a request to the county for instructions. Now the non-member side is preparing to proceed with a legal solution because the association is dominating.</p>
<p>▲ A dispute occurred in the party department. The Wu County Party Department and its branches in the first, second, third, and fourth districts accused Zhu Yan, Liang Liaoyingzhong, etc. of dereliction of duty for personal gain, collecting illegal fees, and embezzling more than 4,000 yuan of party fees. They jointly submitted a complaint to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, requesting a thorough investigation and prosecution to rectify party discipline. On the 6th of this month, Chen Weizhi, a member of the Third District Party Department, went to the Party Department to collect fees. The Party Department considered that Chen Weizhi was suspected of being reactionary, and immediately detained him and telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to send police to escort Chen to the Public Security Bureau, preparing to send him to the province for investigation. However, party members Zhao Qizhen and others believed that Chen Weizhi was arrested innocently and have submitted a request to the province for investigation. Now the province has sent personnel to Suzhou for a secret investigation to verify the case.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ Qingfeng Yarn Factory expands. The Qingfeng Yarn Factory outside Zhou Shanbang, north of the North Gate, was established in the tenth year of the Republic of China. It has 26,400 spindles and 250 looms. The products are two types: plain cloth and flannel. Since the boycott of foreign goods, domestic goods have sold well, and the yarn and cloth produced cannot meet the demand. The yarn factory has been expanded, adding 15,000 spindles and 300 looms. The factory buildings for the cloth factory will be completed in a few days, and the factory buildings for the yarn factory will also be built by the deadline. It is expected that construction will officially start next spring. ▲ The People's Self-Defense Corps will start training on a regular basis. The Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government had previously ordered each county to immediately organize a People's Self-Defense Corps, stipulating that each county should have a chief leader of the People's Self-Defense Corps and each district should have a district leader, with the county magistrate as the chief leader and the district chief as the district leader. The organizational regulations and training subjects will be attached and sent to each county for unified compliance. After receiving the order, Magistrate Chen of this county considered the matter to be important and should be handled quickly. He raised 800 yuan from the county funds and began to prepare for it. At the end of last month, he successively recruited students for the special affairs training class at Shengxi Middle School. The admitted students were officially announced yesterday, including 48 formally admitted corps officers, Dai Linzhi, Hua Yinglong, Yang Jianzhang, Qi Qing, Feng Xianong, and 4 alternate corps officers, Deng Xiangming, etc. Training will begin at Zhidesi Temple in Huishan on the 12th of this month. The training period is set for one year and four months: four months of training, two months of internship, and six months of service.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Jiangsu Province Limits Measures to Increase Land Tax. The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously restricted the increase of surcharges on farmland for the sake of caring for farmers. The committee decided to inform all counties to comply. It has now issued eight measures to limit the increase of land tax, ordering the Finance Department to investigate and comply. The measures are as follows: (1) The total amount of land tax, regular tax, and surcharges shall not exceed one percent of the current land price as stated by the Prime Minister. Counties that have already exceeded this amount shall not increase it further, and shall gradually find ways to reduce it to suit one percent of the land price. (2) The total amount of land tax surcharges shall not exceed the amount of the old regular tax. Counties that have already exceeded the regular tax shall not add surcharges, and shall at most be equal to the regular tax. (3) Change taels of silver to yuan, and clearly indicate the old amount of silver to be paid per mu, the amount of silver yuan converted, and the amount of various surcharges in the easy-to-know form and grain certificate. (3) Rice for transportation should be changed from stones to yuan, and the old number of stones to be completed per mu and the number of various surcharges should be clearly indicated in the easy-to-know form and grain certificate. (5) The number of silver yuan converted into grain should be rounded to cents (6) Each county collects grain tax, still uses the phased collection method, and handles it according to the old example. (7) Before the implementation of clear measurement and pricing, the percentage of land price will temporarily be based on the current land price of each county. (8) If the land price in each city and township is high or low, the average number of each city and township will be used as the standard.</p>
<p>▲ Mutual Accusation of Colluding with Bandits and False Accusation. A dispute arose due to surveying in Gaozi Village, this city. Zhong Zhixi, Sun Xishou, and others mutually accused each other of colluding with bandits and false accusation. The Security Department transferred the case to the court for handling. Zhong Zhixi also intended to reconcile and submitted a request to the Procuratorate of the Local Court to withdraw the case, but it was not approved. The court issued summons yesterday, setting the trial for the morning of the 12th.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Smuggling Firearms Suspect Apprehended. Yesterday, the county police team arrested Lin Henian, a smuggler of firearms, in Guocun, Yiling, and seized a box cannon and 45 bullets. He has been taken back to the team for interrogation and punishment.</p>
<p>▲ Seven Counties Jointly Discuss Business Tax. Based on the resolution of the Provincial Federation of Commerce, the County Chamber of Commerce discussed the issue of business tax. Regarding the affairs of Jiangdu, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Taizhou, and Dongtai counties, Wang Jingting, the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, convened representatives from the chambers of commerce of each county to come to Yangzhou for discussion.

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲ The Ministry of Finance's Tax Police Will Temporarily Station in Nantong. Wang Tianming's unit of the Fourth Regiment of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Police, stationed in Yancheng, was transferred to Nantong last month. Later, it received a telegram from the headquarters ordering it to return to Yancheng. Since the telegram was not detailed, a telegram was sent back to the Hangzhou headquarters for instructions. It was ordered to temporarily station in Nantong to protect tax collection.</p>
<p>▲ The Amount of Funds for National Security has been Determined. The funds for national security in Nantong County are raised by merchants and farmers.

<p>▲ Jiangbei Shanties Repeatedly Catch Fire. The Jiangbei Shanties north of the old school grounds outside the South Gate suddenly burned down a few days ago. Because it was early and there was no water to fetch, the entire area was burned down. More than 20 households in Jiangbei cried and wailed, and went to the shade of withered temples and trees to stay. On the day before yesterday, around dusk, a fire broke out again in the Jiangbei straw sheds along the Gujialang area outside the East Gate. The grass was dry and the wind was strong, and the fire was soaring. Fortunately, the crowd came out together and extinguished it in less than an hour, without spreading to the city.</p>
<p>▲ A Floating Corpse Discovered in the City River. The plague in the city and countryside has become more intense in recent days, with more than a dozen people dying every day. Recently, famous people such as Shen Liansan, the owner of the butcher shop on Main Street, Mo Mengtao, a giant gentleman in Nanhetou, Mrs. Ge Huzhan, a wealthy family, and Ge Qin Yi, a local from Xiaojie Village, have all died of the plague. The people of the county are proposing to open wells and dredge rivers, but unexpectedly, a floating corpse of a child was suddenly found in the Wangyun Bridge City River last night. It has rotted and the face cannot be identified. The river is connected to the four gates, and the city's drinking water is drawn from the official river. For a while, those who saw it were panicked and did not know what to do. Later, a neighbor surnamed Wang funded a historic person to fish it out and bury it.</p>

<p>▲ A Store Accused of Malpractice. The Tiantian Store in Xishuangqiao, this city, is jointly established by wealthy merchants Han Xiangfu, Han Kuiwen, Hu Chengzai, and other small shareholders. It specializes in selling fruits and electrical materials, with Hu Chengzai as the manager and Han Xiangfu responsible for financial matters. Since its opening, it has been several years. Daily business is very prosperous, and outsiders say that it must make a lot of profit. But this year, the store suddenly felt a lack of turnover, and owed a lot of money to fruit and electrical material shops in Shanghai, and repeatedly urged them to ignore it. Now it has sued the court. Small shareholders of the store heard that the store was about to close down, and rushed to check the accounts. They began to send letters to Han and Hu, colluding to cheat, causing a lot of consumption. Now they have collected evidence of malpractice and filed a complaint with the court.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ A Private Tutor Committed Suicide Due to Poverty. Zhou Qingjin, a native of Hang County, 44 years old, had a few thatched houses on Shatianshang, outside Wangjiang Gate, Hangzhou. He taught local children. In recent years, schools have developed, and the establishment of private schools does not conform to modern education. Most of the students have changed to schools. Zhou's students have gradually decreased, and now there are only five or six students left, with a monthly income of only two yuan. Life is difficult, almost unable to make a fire. Therefore, he suddenly had the idea of committing suicide, so he hanged himself with a belt yesterday morning. He was seen by students who came to the school, and he had already died.</p>
<p>▲ The Red Blood Corps Warns the Transportation Industry. After the Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps Office was discovered in Hangzhou, yesterday there was another Chinese Red Blood Corps appearing, specializing in detecting the actions of various industries selling enemy goods. Yesterday, the Transportation Industry Association of this city received a warning letter from the Corps, which said, "Since the anti-Japanese movement has been abolished, Japanese goods have been coming to this city in large numbers. However, it has been found that the import of enemy goods is all handled by your association's member companies. Such profit-making and forgetfulness of righteousness is extremely painful for our country. Now we will issue a warning in advance. If anyone continues to transport enemy goods, our Corps will deal with them in the most severe way."</p>

<h3>Rotary Cup Preliminary Round Third Day: Anglo-American Match Undecided</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Singles Each Won a Set</p>
<p>▲ Another Set of Finals Will Be Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Rotary Cup International Tennis Tournament was the last day of the preliminary round yesterday. Since China had already obtained the right to the finals against Portugal, yesterday's singles was cancelled. Only the Anglo-American teams competed, and two sets of singles started simultaneously at the China Tennis Court from 4:30 p.m. As a result, the Anglo-American teams each won another set, totaling two to two. The situation is still even, and the solution to the finals must wait for the solution of another set of postponed games. It has been decided that it will be held tomorrow at 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>▲ After Squia defeated Turner to start, the old British general showed some edge, and the American Squia had no control strategy, losing the first set 4-6. The competition in the second set was quite intense, and Squia fought hard to win 7-5. After that, Turner, due to old age and lack of strength, did not accomplish much. Squia won two consecutive sets, winning the match 3-1. The scores are as follows: Squia (USA) 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 Turner (England) ▲ Stoker defeated MacDonald. American player MacDonald lost a lot of points, the reason is lack of control. Backhand shots were even less successful. Except for taking a 3-1 lead in the first set, he was willing to surrender and did nothing. As a result, he lost three straight sets. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Stoker (England) 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 MacDonald (USA)</p>
<p>▲ Another set of finals will be held tomorrow. The singles match between MacDonald (USA) and Turner (England) in the first day of the Anglo-American preliminary round has not been held and has been delayed until now. This match has become the key to solving the right to the finals, and its importance has increased. Yesterday, the China Tennis Committee held a meeting to review and discuss how to solve the postponed games. It was believed that the British team's absence was due to a misunderstanding in time coordination and was unintentional. In addition, the American team had expressed a good spirit of not wanting to win without labor, so it was decided to hold the match again tomorrow (Wednesday) at 4:30 p.m.</p>

<h3>Central University Agricultural College Representatives Come to Shanghai to See Cai</h3>
<p>After the Reorganization Committee of Central University implemented the reorganization, changes to the departments of the Agricultural College resulted in the six original departments of Agronomy, Colonization, Forestry, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Sericulture, and Horticulture and Agricultural Chemistry being changed to three departments: Plant Production, Animal Production, and Agricultural Chemistry. Mr. Zhao, who incited the trend, was temporarily appointed to maintain the college's affairs. The professors of the college unanimously believed that this move was contrary to the government's purpose of reorganizing Central University and rectifying education. They sent a telegram to Cai Jiemin and Li Zhongkui of the Central University Reorganization Committee, stating everything in detail, and publicly elected four representatives to come to Shanghai last night to explain the details in person. The telegram and the statements of agricultural groups are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Telegram from Agricultural College Professors to Cai and Li: To Honorable Mr. Cai Jiemin and Mr. Li Zhongkui: The Agricultural College is unfortunate to be included in the reorganization. Now, to have someone who incited the trend temporarily maintain the college's affairs is unfair and contrary to the original intention of the reorganization. Please uphold justice. Sincerely, Chen Guorong, Xia Defu, and twenty-one other professors of the Agricultural College of Central University.</p>
<p>▲ Two agricultural groups both expressed their efforts to strive for: The New China Agricultural Society and the Chinese Forestry Society believe that the Central University Reorganization Committee's reorganization of the Agricultural College's original six departments of Agricultural Colonization, Forestry, Horticulture, Agricultural Chemistry, Sericulture, Animal Husbandry, and Veterinary Medicine into three departments of Animal Production, Plant Production, and Agricultural Chemistry is an unprecedented move in our country. Even in Europe and America, it has never been heard of before. It is clearly a destruction of the academic system and has ulterior motives. The majority of members are extremely indignant and advocate sending a letter to the Central University authorities to question them based on reason. It is also heard that the majority of members of the Chinese Agricultural Society will also raise this issue for discussion at this year's annual meeting, and plan to submit a request to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government to strictly investigate and handle it.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Resolutely Resigns and Telegraphed to Nanjing to Approve Zhang Xueliang's Resignation</h3>
<p>The Six Ministers Visited Wang in the Morning to Persuade Him, but There Was No Result</p>
<p>Wang Told Reporters That There Was No Problem in Taking Over North China</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Has a High Voice to Succeed as Premier of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, Premier of the Executive Yuan, resigned to take responsibility and telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to ask him to retire at the same time to thank the people of the country. Wang received a reply telegram from Zhang Xueliang yesterday afternoon, saying that he had resigned to the Central Government and asked Wang to continue to preside over the central government and not affect the national plan because of him alone. The wording was extremely tactful. The Central Government specially sent He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, to Shanghai yesterday to meet with Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, who was in Shanghai, representing the Central Government, to convey a sincere request to stay and ask Wang to return to Nanjing to preside over the national government. The ministers of the six ministries of Finance, Internal Affairs, Industry, Navy, Military and Political Affairs, and Education, who were in Shanghai, gathered at Wang's residence yesterday morning to meet with Wang, and after three hours of discussion, asked Wang to resume his post, but Wang's attitude was unusually firm, and they dispersed without result. At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, Wang met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence and made an important speech. According to unofficial news yesterday, the Central Government will approve Wang's resignation, and the candidate to succeed as Premier of the Executive Yuan can be decided in the middle of next week, with Cai Yuanpei and Yu Youren having the highest voices. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, came to Shanghai on the order of the Central Government to persuade Wang to stay. He arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing at about 8:00 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by Chen Shaokuan, Chief of Naval Staff. They returned to their private residences for a short rest. At about 9:00 a.m., He went to Haige Road to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng. Soon, Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education, also arrived. They talked until 9:45 a.m., when He, Zhu, and Wu took a car to Wang's residence on Pushi Road to visit Wang, conveying the sincerity of the Central Government's earnest request to stay. As for Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, he stayed at his private residence in Wusong. He did not come to Shanghai yesterday due to business, but sent a special telegram to He stating that he would be allowed to come to Shanghai tomorrow (i.e., today).</p>
<h3>Six Ministers Visit Wang</h3>
<p>After Wang arrived in Shanghai and resigned, he moved to a new residence in western Shanghai to show his determination. Therefore, Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance, and Wu Tiecheng, Mayor, and others visited Wang's new residence for several days, but because very few people knew about it, they could not meet. Since the Central Government sent He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, to Shanghai to persuade him to stay, his family conveyed the message. Wang returned to his residence on West Pushi Road at dawn yesterday. At 8:25 a.m., Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, Huang Shaoxiong, Minister of Internal Affairs, and Peng Xuepei, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan, and others arrived at Wang's residence one after another. At 9:15 a.m., Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance, also arrived. At 10:00 a.m., He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, and Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education, arrived together. At 10:10 a.m., Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, also arrived. After the important figures arrived at Wang's residence, they visited Premier Wang on the second floor of Wang's residence. He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, first represented the Central Government and made a very sincere request to Premier Wang to stay and asked Wang to return to Nanjing immediately to take on the arduous task. Then, in his personal capacity, he urged Wang. Then, the ministers present also sincerely urged Wang to take office. After expressing his gratitude to He, the Central Government representative, and the ministers for their request to stay, Wang elaborated on the reasons for his resignation this time, which was to solve the important problem of North China in the future, and finally stated that his resignation was firm. After Wang finished speaking, the ministers made another request to stay, but Wang's resignation was firm, and there was no result. At 11:50 a.m., the ministers resigned and went to Song's residence for further discussion. They dispersed after talking for twenty minutes. According to a gentleman who participated in the persuasion of Wang, Wang's determination to resign seemed hopeless. The ministers discussed two measures regarding Wang's firm intention to resign and his inability to stay. (1) Make another sincere request to stay; (2) The various problems after Wang's resignation. After the ministers resigned from Wang's residence, they met and talked at Song's residence. The content was to exchange opinions so that they could report to the Central Government and Chairman Jiang, etc. The various problems related to the changes in the political situation were also mentioned.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Statement</h3>
<p>After the meeting adjourned, the reporter went to the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Wu and asked about the situation of the meeting yesterday morning. I was told that this morning, because the Central Government, Chairman Lin, and Chairman Jiang all sent telegrams entrusting Minister He, Minister Song, Minister Chen, and myself as representatives of the Central Government and Chairman Jiang to earnestly request Mr. Wang to stay and continue to serve as Premier of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, we made an appointment in advance this morning to go to Wang's mansion together to see Mr. Wang. In addition to asking Mr. Wang to cancel his resignation, we also had a brief consultation. Although Mr. Wang's intention to resign was still very firm after many people's request to stay, his attitude was better. Finally, he agreed to consider it. Although Wang sent a telegram to the Central Government yesterday requesting that Wang himself and Zhang be allowed to resign together, I expect that the Central Government will definitely not accept this request and will still ask him to resume his post. As for Zhang's resignation, other appropriate measures will be considered. How this measure will be taken cannot be told. As for the consultation at Minister Song's home later, it was to discuss further urging measures and issues related to the current situation.</p>
<h3>Continued Discussion in the Evening</h3>
<p>In addition to the important consultation at Wang's residence at about 10:00 a.m., there was another very important consultation after 5:00 p.m. Those who participated were Premier Wang himself, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, Central Committee member Wu Zhihui, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan Peng Xuepei, and Vice President of the Academia Sinica Yang Xingfo. Wang's wife, Chen Bijun, also participated in the meeting. When the meeting was held, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency happened to be at Wang's residence, so he learned that the focus of the discussion was on the reorganization of the National Government after Wang's resignation. At the same time, the issue of Zhang Xueliang's title after his resignation was also discussed. However, it was learned that among those present, except for Wang, who still expressed his resignation, the rest hoped that Wang would resume his post and were unwilling to reorganize the government at this time. In particular, Minister Song and Wu Zhihui spoke the most on this point. It was also heard that there was an intention to find a proper way to deal with Zhang Xueliang's Pacification Director, but the consultation was entirely to exchange opinions and will continue to be discussed today.</p>
<h3>Wang's Important Talk</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence on Pushi Road at 3:40 p.m. yesterday. Wang's remarks were as follows: (1) The tax revenue of each province is divided into two types: national tax and local tax. The national tax belongs to the central government, and the local tax belongs to the province. This is an easy principle to follow. If Zhang Xueliang, the Pacification Director of Peiping, intercepts all the national tax revenue of Hebei, Rehe, and Chahar, the amount of tax revenue and the types of tax revenue cannot be investigated. Even the tax officials are appointed by him. According to the tax revenue of Hebei in the 14th year of the Republic of China, the local tax was more than 2 million yuan, and the national tax was also more than 2 million yuan. The Changlu salt tax was more than 17 million yuan per year, and the tobacco and alcohol tax was more than 3 million yuan, with an average of more than 5 million yuan per month. The tax revenue cannot be said to be not abundant. After the Shenyang Incident, the central government ordered Director Zhang to resist, but Director Zhang did not send a single soldier and repeatedly telegraphed the central government to ask for huge amounts of money. During the January 28th Incident, the 19th Route Army bravely resisted Japan and did not ask the central government for money, and people from all walks of life gave up their homes to help the country. This is enough to prove that those who are determined to resist Japan are not worried about money, but are only worried about a piece of paper declaration and are unwilling to be determined to resist Japan. (2) In view of this, I telegraphed Director Zhang to resign, and I also firmly requested the central government to resign. Today, Director Zhang has telegraphed the central government, and I have also telegraphed the central government, requesting that Zhang's resignation be approved. The current situation in China, on the surface, has been unified, but in reality, most provinces and regions in the country have established their own banners and do not listen to the orders of the central government. The troops are not dispatched by the central government, and the tax revenue is intercepted by various places and disposed of by themselves. Since the central government cannot command the troops or allocate national taxes, how can the so-called long-term resistance be planned as a whole? My resignation this time is not for any individual, but because I am aware that the country is in urgent need of disaster relief, so if I want to overcome this difficulty, I must plan to resist on the one hand by the Military Affairs Committee and refresh the internal affairs on the other hand to seek factual unification. I intend that the national troops can be commanded by the Military Affairs Committee in the future, and the national finances can be planned by the central government as a whole. If the local expenses are insufficient, the central government will of course try its best to find a way to avoid being restricted. For example, when Gu Zhutong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, resigned due to financial difficulties, the central government sincerely tried to persuade him to stay and tried its best to find ways to relieve his difficulties, which can be taken as a precedent. I hope that the central government will no longer hesitate and will resolutely approve Zhang's resignation and my simultaneous dismissal, and I hope that at the Central Political Conference to be held this Wednesday, a person of high moral standing will be elected to succeed as Premier of the Executive Yuan, and as for the candidates for the various ministries, if the new Premier wants to make any changes, then the selection and reorganization will be on Thursday, so that a new situation can be changed in just four days, and long-term resistance can be planned as a whole, and the country's future will be optimistic.</p>
<h3>No Problem in North China</h3>
<p>When our reporter met with Wang yesterday, he asked Wang a few questions in particular. Wang answered in detail. (Question) Although Zhang Xueliang has resigned to the central government, if the central government sends someone to take over, how should it deal with the possible changes in his subordinates in order to uphold the traditional territorialism? (Answer) I hope that the central government will take the opportunity to approve Zhang's resignation and at the same time select impartial officials, such as He Yingqin and Zhu Peide, etc., who have no favor or grudge with the Northeast Army to take over. I firmly believe that there will be no problem in North China. (Question) Did Mr.'s actions this time obtain the understanding of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in advance? It is rumored that Mr. Chiang is partial to Zhang, and Zhang's resignation is probably just a piece of paper telegram. What does Mr. think? (Answer) On the day I came to Shanghai to resign, I sent secret telegrams to Chiang, and the clear telegrams were those disclosed in the newspaper. The secret telegrams described the course of the resignation and the difficulties of having to communicate with Zhang in order to cope with the extremely serious situation of foreign invasion in North China today. The telegram was very long. After Chiang read the clear telegram, he immediately replied with a sincere request to stay. I will send another telegram to ask him to read the secret telegram in detail and then telegraph his opinion. I think that my personal hard work can be understood. As for the rumor that Chiang is partial to Zhang, it is actually a misunderstanding. Chiang has difficulties with Zhang due to various reasons, so I will first break face with Zhang and do evil, and then Mr. Chiang will be able to deal with it easily. (Question) If the central government resolutely approves Zhang's resignation, but the central government and all parties still unanimously ask Mr. to resume his post and reluctantly take on the arduous task, can Mr. cancel his resignation? (Answer) Every time a warlord is removed, blood must be shed. If this time the North China issue repeats the internal strife, how can I face my people? Therefore, I have been thinking day and night and decided to use a new method to sacrifice me, a scholar, and die with the soldiers to benefit the country, which is very worthwhile. If the central government allows Zhang to resign, in order to implement my words and deeds, no matter what, I will never resume the post of Premier of the Executive Yuan. I would rather be a petty official and serve the public carefully, otherwise, the suspicion will be serious. How can I explain myself? (Question) Will Mr.'s resignation have any impact on domestic and foreign affairs? (Answer) My personal advances and retreats have nothing to do with the country's major plans. If the central government approves my resignation, the successor to the Premier of the Executive Yuan can be appointed on Wednesday. The candidates are Cai Yuanpei, Yu Youren, and Dai Jitao, who are the most suitable. In particular, Mr. Cai Jiemin has high moral standing and is sufficient to cope with it. Then, reorganize the various academies and ministries, which can be completed in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Zhang Responds to Wang with a Geng Telegram</h3>
<p>Limited to immediate arrival, Shanghai Premier Wang Jinggong's signature, received the fish telegram, very sad, Liang's work is not good, heavy burden on me, introspecting, ashamed, the meaning of the area, still willing to Chen for the public, self-defense must be prepared first, preparation can not be lifted without money, Liang's duty, all appeals, are necessary for self-defense, if knowing that the central government is difficult, and deliberately make a request, Liang although ignorant, also dare not come out of this, Zundian said, since a declaration, guarding against foreign insults, told the Ministry of Finance, that is, to raise 5 million, at least 2 million first, although there was this request two months ago, but due to special financial difficulties, I have not dared to mention it again recently, in order to defend itself, the province proposed to request the central government to coordinate the money, and the North China Political Committee decided by the general meeting of the committee to list the names of all the members to urgently ask, not Liang's personal request, and no matter to accuse the Executive Yuan of 3 million per month, the 2 million yuan of the Ministry of Railways was borrowed by the Beining Road, and the Ministry of Railways transferred the account, and I first received a telegram from Minister Song, and I thought that I was aware of Liang's embarrassment, and I ordered Minister Gu to allocate it according to the plan, although the matter has changed in the middle, it also showed the hard work of the public maintenance, in short, Liang Fenggong kept the land, and has always followed the central government's intention, if it is believed that Liang is still in office, it will hinder the progress of domestic affairs or diplomacy, and he will immediately retire, and there is no intention to avoid it, if it is because of Liang, and makes the public embarrassed, and the political hub has no master, Liang's sin, is really one hundred bodies can not be redeemed, I have just followed the public's intention and telegraphed the central government to dismiss my post and select personnel to replace me, but I remember that my public party and country pillar, the sea is in sight, must not be quickly attracted, and ignore the national crisis, and respectfully ask to resume my post immediately, preside over the great government, so that I can save the current difficulties, that is, Liang will also slightly increase the sin, and solemnly reply, all hope to be accepted, Zhang Xueliang kowtows, Gengyin,</p>
<h3>Wang Sends Another Telegram to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Nanjing Central Executive Committee, received Director Zhang's Geng Ri reply to Zhaoming Yu telegram, saying that self-defense must be prepared, preparation can not be raised without money, the duty is in place, all appeals, are necessary for self-defense, recite again and again, full of emotions, there is a thorn in the throat, willing to speak out quickly, the collection of provinces, the big difference is two types of national tax and local tax, the national tax belongs to the central government, the local tax belongs to the province, is an easy principle to follow, if there are provinces that offer the national tax to the central government, and the province's tax revenue is not enough for the province's administrative use, the central government should be responsible for solving the difficulties, for example, last month, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, resigned because the province's tax revenue could not make ends meet, Zhaoming's difficulties, regarded as being in the same position, repeatedly discussed, although it was not completely resolved, but the hardships have not been shared, and the joys and sorrows have not been related, if Zhang Zhuren's rule of Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, etc., all the national tax revenue has been intercepted, and not a single article is solved in the national treasury, not only the amount of tax revenue, the central government has no way to intervene, that is, the tax officials are also appointed by themselves, and have never told the central government, as for the local tax revenue, the names are numerous, and it is even more impossible to investigate, and its use is to support the troops, and how many troops are there, and how much does each soldier get per month, the central government also has no right to intervene, once the territory is in trouble, the central government is responsible for defense, then the telegrams for asking for military pay come like snowflakes, self-defense must first be prepared, preparation is not money, but the so-called money, has been swallowed by the mouth on weekdays, not a single drop is left, how can the central government get money to respond to its request, if the request is not fulfilled, then all the responsibility belongs to the central government, and it is not its fault to hand over the land to the enemy, alas, this kind of situation is not only the case in Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, but it is especially the case in Zhang Zhuren's rule, the name is one family, but in fact it is a foreign country, it is painful to speak of this, I believe that the only way to resist the powerful enemy today is to break the situation of the military separatism of each province, so that the central government can gather the wealth of the whole country and transport the troops of the whole country to fight for the survival of the whole country, if it can be like this, I dare not say that it will win, and the long-term resistance can be guaranteed, otherwise, it will collapse and disintegrate, and it will be too late to save itself, let alone save the country, Zhaoming is a scholar who holds the state affairs, empty-handed, what is the basis, can resist the separatist soldiers of each province, only the conscience does not die, the mouth and tongue still exist, with boldness and courage, the naked and dark chaotic situation of the whole country's internal affairs is exposed to the world, or it is said that taking chaos and insulting the dead, only to open the covetous, have never thought that this kind of dark chaotic situation, the neighboring country has already known it, what is unknown is, our country people, hiding the disease and avoiding the doctor, what is the use of it, now, Zhang Zhuren has said that he has telegraphed the central government to dismiss his post and select personnel to replace him, and I hope that the central government will immediately agree to his request, in order to break the situation of the military separatism, and at the same time, I hope that the central government will also agree to Zhaoming's request to dismiss his post as Premier of the Executive Yuan, in order to serve as a warning to those who have been in office for several months and have achieved nothing, so that the national people will admire the central government's determination to work hard for survival, and the central political and local political reforms will be carried out at the same time, and Zhaoming will be a copyist and sweeper in the party department, and will serve day and night, and dare not relax himself, pouring blood and Chen Ci, but the vertical mirror, Wang Zhaoming Qi,</p>
<h3>Various Industries Send Letters to Wang</h3>
<p>Various trade associations sent a letter to Wang Jingwei yesterday, saying that Mr. Jingwei's help and identification, according to the newspaper reports, Mr.'s telegram of resignation as Premier of the Executive Yuan, the meaning of public loyalty and national integrity, is overflowing, but the Japanese invaders are wanton, the Red bandits are rampant, alarm bells are ringing frequently, and the country is in a difficult time, Mr. is the first of the executive, and suddenly wants to retire, the group is panic, and do not know what to do, secretly thinking that the Central Political Conference, is the hub of decision-making and planning, but Hu Changwuwei, then Fei Dun Hong Kong, ignoring the state affairs, Jiang Changwei, then Feng ordered the suppression of bandits, sitting in Hanzu, can not come to Beijing to preside, then the leader of the group, the decision of the great plan, the potential is only Mr. is dependent on, if Mr. is also one of the things like Hu, and Jiangwei can not take care of it, then the central government is empty, and is giving the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of, this Mr. can not resign one also, the Executive Yuan is the center of launching politics, the relationship is significant, not to mention that in this difficult time, no matter the resistance to Japan and the suppression of bandits, there should be a comprehensive plan, practical preparation, and full assistance, and these tasks are all within the scope of the Executive Yuan's powers, should be presided over by Mr., now that the affairs are not over, and Mr. suddenly said resignation, those who know it may be able to bend and understand Mr.'s difficulties, those who do not know it will certainly take Mr. as retreating in the face of difficulties, it seems that it is not what a responsible politician should do, and the central government has no one, and the great government is stagnant, its impact on the country's future is even more profound and huge, this Mr. should not resign two also, looking for the reason for Mr.'s resignation, in the telegram to Zhang Xueliang, there is a saying (the only way to resign from the blame, to thank one person), then Mr.'s resignation, is due to the departure of Zhang Xueliang alone, Zhang Xueliang is indeed guilty, but the country punishes the official of the job, knowing that there is a track to follow, and Mr. holds the great plan, also has the right to dispose of it, now Mr. in order to thank Zhang Xueliang alone, and actually abandon his job and leave, and ignore the national crisis, and give the slanderer an excuse, Mr. will be able to explain himself, this Mr. should not resign three also, since acting as Premier of the Executive Yuan, holding the crisis and helping the head, enduring humiliation and bearing the burden, both inside and outside are admired, now actually flicking his sleeves and leaving, whether for the sake of the country or for Mr. personal account, all are not what a virtuous person should do, but also pray for the spirit of great fearlessness, to cancel the resignation, and order the drive to return, the country is very fortunate, silk satin industry association, cotton cloth industry association, rice shop industry association, coal ash industry association, sugar industry association, north and south exchange industry association, silk mercerized cotton weaving industry association, color printing industry association, 睗 industry association, flying flower industry association more than one hundred industry associations kowtow together,</p>
<h3>Mei Lehe Publishes Account of Puppet State Seizing Customs</h3>
<p>Regarding the puppet state seizing customs in the Northeast, Chief Inspector of Customs Mei Lehe has recently published a declaration in English, which is translated below:</p>
<p>(I) Since the establishment of the so-called Northeast Administrative Committee by the puppet state government on February 17th of this year, it has notified the superintendents and commissioners of customs in the Northeast, claiming that since the customs houses belong to the puppet Manchurian state, they should be under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Administrative Committee. At the same time, the superintendents and commissioners of customs were instructed by the committee to continue their services as usual, and it was stated that a Japanese advisor had been appointed to each customs house to monitor all customs affairs. The puppet state first began by blocking tax revenues, then confiscated the accumulated customs duties in various banks, and finally, under high pressure, expelled the customs commissioners and forcibly took over the customs houses. The procedures they took were roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(II) The amount of revenue from each customs house in the Northeast in 1931 can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>Longjing Village Customs: Customs taels 574,000</p>
<p>Andong Customs: Customs taels 3,682,000</p>
<p>Niuzhuang Customs: Customs taels 3,792,000</p>
<p>Harbin Customs: Customs taels 5,272,000</p>
<p>Although Aihun Customs belongs to the Northeast customs, it is not within the sphere of influence of the puppet Manchurian state, so it is still under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government and has not been affected by the puppet state's power. As for the suspension of remittances of customs duties from Dalian Customs and the establishment of the puppet Manchurian state customs, etc., these will be discussed in detail separately at the end of this declaration. The following is the recent changes of each customs house: ▲ Longjing Village Yanji Customs Commissioner Wallace (British) received a notice from the Yanji Customs Superintendent in early March stating that the Northeast Administrative Committee had appointed a Japanese advisor and that all customs affairs must be discussed with the Japanese advisor. However, after that time, there were no drastic changes for a long time. Until June 21st, the Japanese advisor suddenly ordered the Korean Bank, where the customs deposits were stored, that any checks issued by the customs commissioner would not be valid. However, since the Korean Bank is a Japanese bank and not under the jurisdiction of the puppet Manchurian state, there was no legal basis for not complying with the commissioner's order to transfer customs revenues. On June 29th, the Customs Superintendent, accompanied by Japanese advisor Miyamoto and Japanese officer Inoue, suddenly arrived at the customs house. Miyamoto and Inoue did not enter, but the Superintendent, accompanied by a guard holding a pistol, entered and demanded immediate handover. Since the Customs Commissioner had no weapons, he naturally could not resist. Therefore, the Superintendent brought in the Japanese advisor and declared that the Japanese advisor had been appointed as the customs commissioner of the customs house. The last day Longjing Village remitted taxes was June 22nd of this year. The Chief Inspector of Customs sent the following official letter to the Japanese Embassy on July 12th, but has not yet received a reply. The official letter is as follows (formal address omitted): Sir, I have received a report from Wallace, Customs Commissioner of Liaoji Customs, stating that the Customs Commissioner and his staff have been expelled by soldiers under the command of a Japanese advisor, and the Japanese advisor was accompanied by Inoue, a local Japanese military officer. Wallace also reported that Magan, a British Chinese customs officer at the Hunchun sub-customs, was also unable to perform his duties due to armed interference and was in danger, etc. I hereby request your mediation as to why the Japanese military authorities, such as Japanese officer Inoue, directly interfere in the Chinese customs administration along with Manchurian advisors (remainder omitted).</p>
<p>▲ Andong The first instance of interference experienced by Andong Customs Commissioner Torbor was in early March, when the Japanese Consul, in his private capacity, advised the Customs Commissioner that the Customs Superintendent would ask him to prepare for the transfer of the customs to the jurisdiction of the puppet state. Before long, a Japanese advisor was appointed to the customs, but the advisor did not take active action until mid-June, relaying an order from the puppet state's Ministry of Finance, ordering the Bank of China to no longer remit taxes to Shanghai. Since then, the taxes collected were deposited in the Bank of China. On June 16th, four armed puppet police officers, accompanied by the Japanese deputy inspector of the puppet police station, went to the Bank of China to notify the manager that they were there to guard the taxes. On June 19th, the Bank of China delivered 783,000 taels to the Eastern Three Provinces Official Bank, and notified the Customs Commissioner that it was the result of armed coercion.</p>
<p>Part of the customs duties from Andong Customs were stored in the Korean Bank, which is a Japanese company and enjoys consular jurisdiction, not subject to the jurisdiction of the puppet state authorities. Unexpectedly, it refused to remit the taxes, claiming that it was instructed by the Seoul headquarters to hand over all taxes to the Manchurian government. According to reports, the Seoul headquarters of the Korean Bank consulted with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance on this issue. After the Andong taxes were seized, the second step was to seize the customs administration. On June 26th and 27th, the Japanese advisor repeatedly demanded that the customs be handed over to him, which the Customs Commissioner refused. The next day, the puppet superintendent, accompanied by the advisor and ten secretaries, went to the customs house to demand the keys. The Customs Commissioner refused their request, and two armed puppet police officers (both Japanese) entered the room and forcibly demanded the keys. The Customs Commissioner still refused to comply. Then, four puppet police officers (all Japanese) with rifles and bayonets entered the room, surrounding the Customs Commissioner's signing desk. The Customs Commissioner had no choice but to succumb to the force. After lodging a final protest, he left the customs house. On June 30th, twenty-seven customs officials from Andong Customs (25 Japanese, 2 Koreans) resigned from their positions in the Chinese customs and transferred to the employment of the puppet state. The Customs Commissioner then moved the remaining customs officials who were loyal to the customs to the Customs Commissioner's residence to work, which was located in the Japanese-managed railway-affiliated area, hoping to continue performing customs duties. On the same day, Japanese advisor Qichuan, accompanied by plainclothes armed Japanese, entered the Customs Commissioner's residence and demanded the files, claiming that if the files were not handed over, they would be seized by force. For safety reasons, the Customs Commissioner had moved to the residence in advance. He protested to the visitors that they were forcibly entering the residence of an American located in the Japanese settlement and asked the advisor whether he had notified the Japanese Consul and obtained his consent. The advisor replied that he was acting on orders and was not subject to the orders of the Japanese Consul. The Customs Commissioner still refused to hand over the files. Three more plainclothes armed Japanese entered the room. Seeing that the Customs Commissioner firmly refused to comply, they drew their pistols and pointed them at him. The Customs Commissioner was forced to hand over the files at gunpoint, which were immediately taken away by the Japanese. At that time, the Customs Commissioner sent a British customs official to the neighboring Japanese Consulate to request</p>

<p>assistance, but the Consul was away on official business and the Vice Consul did not take any action to prevent this armed seizure of files. It is reported that 80% of the customs duties from Andong Customs were collected within the Japanese-managed Manchurian Railway-affiliated area. Therefore, the Customs Commissioner attempted to perform customs duties within the Manchurian Railway-affiliated area, believing that the Japanese authorities would not allow the puppet police to interfere within the affiliated area. Unfortunately, things did not turn out as expected. The puppet police entered the affiliated area and arbitrarily arrested four customs officials and intimidated the remaining officials. The Customs Commissioner had no power to protect the lives of his staff, and was forced to completely suspend customs duties within the railway-affiliated area. The last batch of funds remitted from Andong was on April 19th of this year.</p>
<p>▲ Niuzhuang Shanhaiguan Customs Commissioner She Naoman (British) reported that the Japanese advisor had requested the Bank of China on March 26th to hand over the accumulated customs duties and future taxes to the Eastern Three Provinces Official Bank. Under armed threat, the bank was forced to comply. However, half of Niuzhuang's tax revenue was deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, which is a Japanese institution with consular jurisdiction and not subject to the jurisdiction of the puppet state authorities. Unexpectedly, when the Customs Commissioner instructed it to remit the remaining tax revenue to Shanghai, the manager of the bank used the excuse that the puppet government had asked it to suspend remittances as a reason for refusing to comply. However, there were not many actions regarding the customs administration at first. On June 27th, the puppet superintendent and the Japanese advisor led a team of armed police to forcibly occupy the customs house. The Japanese staff of the customs also resigned from their positions in the Chinese customs and were employed by the puppet state. The local authorities appointed the former deputy customs commissioner Jiang Yuan as the customs commissioner of the puppet state. The Chinese staff of the customs were forcibly forced to continue their duties as before. One person who wanted to leave was arrested and detained. The last batch of funds remitted from the customs was on April 16th of this year.</p>
<p>▲ Harbin Binjiang Customs Commissioner Derong (British) reported that the puppet Manchurian state had taken away the customs duties stored in the Bank of China in Harbin at the end of March and forced the bank to promise to remit all future tax revenues to the Eastern Three Provinces Official Bank. Afterwards, the Customs Commissioner and his staff continued to work as usual for about two months, but were constantly subjected to various pressures to join the puppet state's customs. On June 26th, the true attitude of the puppet state was revealed, as puppet state police surrounded the customs house at midnight, led by the Japanese Consul, and forcibly took it over. The next morning, the Customs Commissioner went to the customs house, but was unable to enter because the customs house had been sealed off. On the same day, plainclothes Japanese (who openly admitted to being affiliated with the Japanese military commission) went to the homes of Chinese and Russian customs officials and forced them to sign voluntary applications to join the puppet state's customs. A Japanese advisor and police officers visited Deputy Customs Commissioner An Boke at his private residence and asked him to serve as the Customs Commissioner, stating that if he was willing to serve the puppet state in managing the Harbin Customs, he would receive a one-time reward of 8,500 pounds. An Boke refused to accept the bribe. Several days later, An was illegally arrested and imprisoned for five days. Many other customs officials were also arrested, including She De (Norwegian), the acting customs officer of the Manzhouli sub-customs. The Chinese customs officials were especially terrified. Even the Customs Commissioner's residence was surrounded by puppet state police. Soon, the puppet police broke into the door and entered, inspected the residence, and took away all the customs files. Finally, the Customs Commissioner and other customs officials were ordered to leave their residence. The last day Harbin remitted funds was March 28th.</p>
<p>▲ Dalian The Dalian Customs Commissioner is Japanese Fukumoto Jun, who has now been dismissed. The total tax revenue of the customs last year was 12,448,800 customs taels. The establishment of the Dalian Customs was based on the Dalian Customs Agreement concluded with Japan in 1907. Since the area is within the leased territory, the Chinese authorities initially believed that it would not be subject to the interference of the puppet state. Who knew that the changes would come as a surprise. Before June 7th, the Dalian customs duties were remitted every three or four days. However, from June 7th to 14th, the Chief Inspector of Customs did not see the tax revenue remitted, so he telegraphed Dalian to inquire about the reason for the delay. At that time, Customs Commissioner Fukumoto telegraphed back, saying that he feared that the remittance would provoke incidents, so he had not yet decided. Fukumoto also stated that Kawai, the foreign affairs secretary of the Kwantung Government, had expressed to Fukumoto that the puppet Manchurian state had a reason to enjoy the tax revenue of the customs houses within its territory. Afterwards, the Chief Inspector of Customs and Fukumoto telegraphed each other repeatedly. Fukumoto finally had no choice but to obey the order and try to remit the funds. Unexpectedly, all the procedures had been completed and the funds were about to be remitted when Kawai, a Japanese government official, suddenly interfered and did not allow the remittance to be made immediately. This Japanese official was not an official of the puppet Manchurian state. Therefore, the Chief Inspector of Customs sent a warning to Fukumoto on June 22nd that if he still did not follow the instructions, he should be regarded as disobeying orders. Fukumoto telegraphed back that he had received instructions from a certain party, and that if he obeyed the Chief Inspector of Customs' orders, it would greatly hinder Japanese interests, so he could not remit the funds. In short, Fukumoto was following the orders of the Kwantung authorities and refused to obey the legitimate instructions of the Chief Inspector of Customs. Therefore, the Chief Inspector of Customs dismissed Fukumoto on June 24th on the grounds of arrogance and disobedience. After Fukumoto was dismissed, the Chief Inspector of Customs appointed Nakamura Gen, the Japanese Deputy Customs Commissioner, to temporarily act as the Dalian Customs Commissioner. However, after receiving the instructions, Nakamura Gen resigned, and all 62 customs officials of Dalian Customs, except for one who had not yet resigned, telegraphed the Chief Inspector of Customs to announce that they were severing relations with the Chinese customs. The Chief Inspector of Customs has recently appointed Kishimoto Hirokichi to succeed Fukumoto as the Dalian Customs Commissioner in accordance with the aforementioned Dalian Customs Agreement and notified the Japanese Embassy on June 25th, requesting its consent. However, as of four weeks, the Japanese authorities have not sent a reply. Furthermore, after Fukumoto was dismissed, the puppet Manchurian state independently organized the Dalian Customs, with Fukumoto leading the Japanese customs officials to serve, and has now begun to illegally collect taxes.</p>
<h3>Maochang Bombing Case Yun Huifang Released on Bail Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Sentencing Set for the Morning of the 11th</p>
<p>Yun Huifang, a member of the Blood Soul Assassination Corps, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the French Concession Police on the 5th of this month for throwing a hand grenade as a warning at Maochang Foreign Goods Store on Minquan Road for selling Japanese goods. She was escorted to the Second Special District Court yesterday morning and released on bail after a trial at 2:00 PM. The sentencing is scheduled for the 11th. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Details of the Yun Case Yun Huifang, a patriotic youth from Changzhou, is 16 years old and works as a typesetter at the Lianhua Printing Factory on Shanhai Pass Road in the Public Concession. Her home is located at No. 207 Hengzhi Lane, Parker Road. During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai this spring, she served as a volunteer soldier and worked on the front lines. After the ceasefire, she returned to her original job. Recently, she hated the general profiteers who sold Japanese goods, so she joined the Blood Soul Assassination Corps as a member. She learned that Shen Maochun, a Ningbo native who opened the Maochang Foreign Goods Store at No. 347 Minquan Road in the French Concession, secretly sold inferior goods. On the evening of the 5th of this month, she carried a hand grenade and threw it at the Maochang Store as a warning. She turned and fled towards the Chinese area and was intercepted by a patrol officer and taken to the First Branch of the Second District Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The French Concession Police learned of this and sent detectives to inspect the Maochang Store. The explosive force was weak and did not injure anyone, only damaging five pieces of window glass and one square of the floor. A package of shrapnel was recovered and taken back to the police station for review. Various groups in Shanghai tried to rescue her.</p>
<p>▲ Police Investigation The acting director of the investigation unit of the political department of the French Concession Police, the French officer Sineng (transliteration), believed that the incident occurred in the French Concession, so he sent detectives to the Public Security Bureau last Saturday morning to bring Yun Huifang to the police station for investigation. He also joined Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession Police to search Yun's residence and found a hand grenade similar to the one thrown (now stored in the Public Police Station), preparing to send it to the court for questioning. Her family hired lawyers Zhao Chen and Shen Junru to defend and rescue her. The Changzhou Fellow Association also believed that Yun was detained for her patriotic enthusiasm and hired lawyer Liu Hongxun to appear in court on her behalf.</p>
<p>▲ Court Hearing Yesterday morning, the police escorted the defendant to the Second Special District Court for questioning. Her defense lawyers, Zhao, Shen, and Liu, also arrived at the court to wait for instructions. The police were represented by lawyer Fei Xizhen. Due to the congestion of trivial cases in the police station, the case was moved to the afternoon for trial. At 2:35 PM, Chief Judge Gang Xu of the Criminal Court, accompanied by acting clerk Ren Qiyuan and prosecutor Wu Xiaoke, took their seats in the Criminal Court. Chief Clerk Xiao Jinfang sat on the left side of the case to listen. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent executive committee member Ma Shaoquan to the court with a letter requesting leniency for the defendant. The defendant was brought out of the police detention center by the bailiffs, wearing a white short shirt with blue stripes, white cotton pants, a white serge long shirt, her hair cut in a flat top, purple-gray socks, and yuan-colored iron-machine satin shoes, standing calmly in the defendant's dock. No one from the plaintiff Maochang Store appeared in court. The court first questioned the defendant's age, origin, occupation, and address. The police lawyer stated the intention to prosecute, stating that the defendant threw a hand grenade at the Maochang Foreign Goods Store at No. 347 Minquan Road on the afternoon of August 5th, although it did not cause any disaster, only damaging glass floors. The defendant was detained by Chinese police in the Chinese area and brought back by the police. The defendant lived in the Public Concession and a similar hand grenade was found in her home. According to her confession, she obtained it as a volunteer soldier during the Sino-Japanese War and is currently a member of the Blood Soul Assassination Corps. The political department is prosecuting her under Articles 158, 166, and 381 of the Criminal Law. The police need to investigate further and request an extension of the week for trial. They also presented a package of shrapnel. The official asked the defendant, "When is your birthday?" She replied, "December 16th, snake." "Did you throw the hand grenade at Maochang Store at 9:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th?" She replied, "I threw it because he sells Japanese goods and I hate him very much. I wrote a letter to warn him first, but he ignored me, so I threw the hand grenade in his store to warn him. I planned to destroy his things to make him realize." "Where did you get the hand grenade?" She replied, "I was a volunteer soldier before and left four when I worked in Baoshan. Two have been used for warnings." "Who told you to throw it?" She replied, "It was my own conscience that dictated it." "The police accuse you of being a member of the Blood Soul Assassination Corps, is that true?" She replied, "I am one of the two who organized it. There is also someone named Li who does an oil business. They specialize in warning profiteers not to buy enemy goods and have no other purpose." The defendant spoke generously and passionately during her confession. At this point, the court ruled that the case was clear and there was no need for postponement.</p>
<p>▲ Lawyers' Arguments The court then ordered the beginning of arguments. First, the police lawyer argued according to the criminal law, item by item, and changed Article 381 to Article 382. Then, the lawyers hired by the defendant argued according to the law and asked the court to consider the defendant's young age and patriotic movement and give her a lenient sentence. Finally, the prosecutor gave his opinion and the court ruled that the arguments were over and set the sentencing for 9:00 AM on the 11th.</p>
<p>▲ Bail Granted According to the defendant's lawyer's request to allow the defendant to be released on bail to await instructions, the official asked the police for their opinion. The police lawyer stated that the police could agree if the defendant had a proper guarantee. The court then ordered the defendant to provide two store guarantees and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Rise Up to Resist Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>▲ Letter from the Municipal Cotton Industry Association The Shanghai Municipal Cotton Industry Association sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating, "Sir, our association has recently received letters signed by Jiang Shunchang, Blood Soul Assassination Corps, Patriotic Extermination Corps, Teenage Iron-Blooded National Salvation Corps, Anti-Japanese National Salvation Inspection Team, Extermination Inspection Team, Red-Blooded Extermination Corps, and Mu Zhongren Zhenxing Company, reporting that Yongyu Cotton Cloth Store at No. 51 Guangyu Lane, Pingliang Road; Tongfongsheng, Xieshengchang, Jufengyong, Xingchang, and Futai Cotton Cloth Stores at Zhengjia Muqiao; Zhichangxiang Cotton Cloth Store at No. 9 De'an Lane, Beishanxi Road; Hongda and Shunchang Cotton Cloth Stores at No. 451 Xiqingyu Lane, Beijing Road; Warehouse at No. 479 Hongde Lane, Zhejiang Road; and Tongshun Cotton Cloth Store at No. 486 across the street; Dacheng and Hefeng Cotton Cloth Stores at No. 66 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road; and Yuyuanheng Cotton Cloth Store in Zhoujin Lane all have private smuggling of enemy goods and disguise. Our association checked the stores reported in the letter and found that only Yongyu, Tongfongsheng, Xieshengchang, and Yuyuanheng are members of our association. We sent personnel to secretly investigate and learned that Yongyu has recently stopped and stated in a letter that they will never lose their personality and privately import enemy goods. If any fraud is found, they are willing to accept severe punishment. The rest of the stores either match the reports in the letter or have temporarily suspended their activities due to the increasingly fierce anti-enemy goods movement in various circles. After receiving the reports, our association has severely warned the above four members and given them three days to reply and express their attitude for verification. As for the other stores, since they have not joined our association, our association has no power to intervene. We can only report them to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for verification. We are afraid that the outside world will not know the truth and there will be misunderstandings, so we are specifically stating the process and sending this letter, hoping that your newspaper will disclose it. We would be very grateful."</p>
<p>▲ Emergency Meeting of the Southern Goods Industry Association The Shanghai Municipal Southern Goods Industry Association held an emergency meeting of the executive committee at 2:00 PM yesterday regarding repeated warnings from the Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps. Chairman Gong Jingyan reported and then began the discussion, resolving the following items: (1) Regarding the warnings from the Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps, notify all members to unanimously never sell inferior goods, do their best to promote domestic products, and ask all executive committee members to investigate in segments, and send staff to secretly and closely investigate. Enemy goods sealed up shall be sealed up forever in the store. Anyone found privately selling enemy goods shall be immediately detained and submitted to the executive committee for severe punishment, and all members shall be notified to abide by it. (2) According to the Chamber of Commerce Law, this association should re-elect half of the executive committee members. A general meeting of members will be held at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month for re-election, and members will be notified. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>▲ General Meeting of the Copper and Tin Industry Self-Defense Corps The Copper and Tin Industry Association's Self-Defense Corps held a general meeting of all members at 3:00 PM yesterday, with 25 people attending. Chairman Er Jun presided over the meeting and performed the rituals. The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and Tian Hexiang and Yu Futang, as well as guest Wang Bingquan, spoke in succession and put forward discussions: (1) The chairman reported that if Japanese goods are found again from today, how should they be handled? It was resolved to voluntarily seal them up. (2) How should violations or private imports of Japanese goods be handled? It was resolved that members of the same industry have the right to supervise each other and are allowed to report to this association for verification and handling. (3) Should inspectors be hired to assist members in supervising what they cannot reach? It was resolved to publish a notice to recruit two inspectors to take responsibility. (4) Tian Hexiang suggested that since we voluntarily seal up domestically, should we also inspect other businesses or copper factories that have not joined the association that privately import Japanese goods or disguise them as domestic goods? It was resolved that we should first investigate the actual situation, specify the business or factory name, and send a letter to the Municipal Street Association for detailed investigation. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Attention to the Eliminate Traitors Group</h3>
<p>▲ Secret Agent Team Organized, Investigation Commenced Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Foreign Ministry Requesting Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>Since the traitorous merchants in this city have repeatedly received bomb threats from the Iron Blood Eliminate Traitors Group, they have been in a state of panic and have ceased trading with Japan. According to reliable investigations, in the last half-month, Chinese merchants requesting returns of goods to the Japanese side have reached over one million yuan. This has led to unrest among the Japanese, and although the resident community and other related groups have repeatedly convened meetings to discuss countermeasures, no appropriate solution has been found to date. The night before last, the Federation of Japanese Chambers of Commerce and the Textile Industry Association, among others, held an emergency meeting at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce headquarters. The result of the discussion was the determination of the following two countermeasures: (1) Telegraph the Foreign Ministry to promptly lodge a direct protest with the Chinese authorities, demanding that they issue a general order to all provinces and cities to effectively prevent the activities of organizations such as the Iron Blood Eliminate Traitors Group. (2) Organize a secret agent team to conduct a rigorous investigation of the movements of the Iron Blood Eliminate Traitors Group in advance, as a basis for handling the matter. The telegram from the Japanese merchants in Shanghai to their government and the organizational law of the secret agent team are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Foreign Ministry (abridged above) The Shanghai war has ended, and the losses of our Japanese merchants in Shanghai have reached approximately eight million yuan. Due to the magnitude of the sacrifices, they have not yet been able to recover. The Chinese government, in retaliation for the Manchurian state's takeover of the Dalian Customs, imposed double taxation previously (?). The Iron Blood Eliminate Traitors Group and others are now openly active, on the one hand inflicting heavy blows on our merchants, and on the other hand causing extreme panic among the Chinese merchants who trade with us, who are requesting returns of goods. Within ten days, the value of goods stockpiled in warehouses has reached over one million yuan. Under this dual pressure, the overseas merchants are truly powerless to seek the development of trade with China. If this continues, it is feared that the Far Eastern market will have no place for our Great Japanese Empire. Therefore, we have no choice but to urgently telegraph, requesting prompt and direct serious negotiations with the Chinese government, demanding that the national, provincial, and municipal authorities of that country strictly and rigorously prevent all similar organizations to the Iron Blood Eliminate Traitors Group, and prohibit them from further threatening Chinese merchants who trade with us in various ways, so that the goods stockpiled in warehouses can be gradually sold off, in order to restore our country's (the Japanese referring to themselves) inherent power in trade with China. Otherwise, the future of trade with China will forever be in a dangerous situation. This telegram is respectfully submitted, requesting prompt action, not only for the benefit of all the overseas merchants in Shanghai, but also for the benefit of the merchants and people of our entire country, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Organization of a Secret Agent Team The organization of the Japanese secret agent team was decided and established at the meeting two days ago. Its organizational law is to be jointly organized by the dispatch of five people each from various commercial and related organizations in Shanghai, with ten people forming a small team. In total, approximately ten small teams can be formed. Each small team has a captain to direct daily investigations, and a overall captain to manage all the affairs of the team. The captains of each small team must report the daily findings of the team members to the overall captain in writing. If a serious situation arises temporarily and there is no time to report in writing, the overall captain can be reported to directly by telephone, and the overall captain will then handle the matter as appropriate. When secret agent team members go out to investigate, they should be given an appropriate symbol or proof of identity, which must be returned after returning to the team. It is also understood that this Japanese secret agent team began its investigation yesterday in both the Chinese and foreign districts.</p>
<p>According to another source, the Public Concession Police, due to the activities of the Eliminate Traitors Group, fear that they will disrupt local order and have sent detectives to listen for information about the group in various places in order to stop them at any time.</p>
<h3>Mi Chunlin Discusses the Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>▲ Detailed Counter-Japanese Measures to be Requested from the Central Government</p>
<p>▲ Hoping for Public Assistance Should There Be Incident in Rehe</p>
<p>Mr. Mi Chunlin, the former Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government, left Beiping on the third of this month and arrived in Nanjing on the fifth. He arrived in Shanghai last night via train from Nanjing. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Mi at his hotel and asked if he had been ordered by Director Zhang of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters to report to the Central Government on the political situation in the Northeast. Mr. Mi immediately denied this, stating that it was a private matter and that he had come to Shanghai to handle personal affairs. However, Director Zhang, taking advantage of his trip south, had entrusted him to carry letters to various friends in Nanjing. The reporter then asked about the current situation in the Northeast. Mr. Mi discussed that the Northeast issue can be divided into three aspects: (1) the Sino-Japanese problem, (2) the Northeast Volunteer Army problem, and (3) the recent resignation of President Wang. Since he left Beiping on the third, he could not answer the third question. The second issue concerns the people's automatic resistance to the Japanese army's trampling. The government naturally expresses its approval of this, but apart from what he has learned from the newspapers, he cannot report on its content and current situation. As for the first question, since the September 18th Shenyang Incident, Director Zhang has only obeyed the Central Government's orders in all his actions. The original hope was that the Japanese warlords would realize their mistakes and, on the one hand, listen to the fair resolution of the League of Nations. However, the Japanese side not only did not realize their mistakes but also became increasingly aggressive. Therefore, Director Zhang immediately convened an emergency meeting of Northeast generals to discuss resistance, drafted detailed measures, and submitted them to the Central Government for instructions. Furthermore, due to the emergency in Rehe, when he left Beiping, seven vanguard brigades had already departed for the border defense, and subsequent deployments were to follow. However, because it concerned military plans, he was not able to disclose them. However, to the best of his knowledge, Director Zhang not only had a long-standing determination to resist but also had factual evidence to support it. As for the economic situation in the Northeast, because the three provinces had already been occupied by the violent Japanese, and Rehe was mostly mountainous with little annual income, only Hebei and Chahar provinces, including Tianjin, had a monthly income of approximately four million yuan. However, the current Northeast army has a strength of 200,000 men, concentrated in the Hebei area, and the monthly expenses require approximately 80% of the total amount, with the remaining 20% allocated to various government expenses, making it truly difficult. During the January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War, the people enthusiastically contributed to boost morale. If there is another incident in Rehe in the future, it is hoped that donations will be received and provided. It is also hoped that assistance will be provided to the Northeast Volunteer Army, because the army relies on morale, and so-called morale is a sufficient supply and assistance from the rear. Although the Northeast Volunteer Army's morale is currently high, ammunition and food are lacking. Without assistance, it is feared that they will not be able to sustain their resistance. He will stay in Shanghai for four or five days and then return north.</p>
<h3>German-Russian Company Agrees to Send Aircraft to Transfer Eurasian Air Transport</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation had previously requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to telegraph the German government, requesting that the German-Russian Aviation Company send aircraft to the Sino-Russian border at the specified time to transport Eurasian airmail, etc. It is now learned that the Eurasian Aviation Company in Shanghai received a telegram from the German-Russian Aviation Company in Berlin yesterday, agreeing to do so.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Schmidt, the director of the aviation group of the Eurasian Aviation Company, and Mr. Liao Guanxuan, the director of the operations group, flew from Shanghai to Beiping on the fifth of this month and will fly from Beiping to Suzhou, Hami, Dihua, Tacheng, etc., tomorrow (the 10th) to conduct their second test flight (the previous test flight was conducted by Mr. Li Jingcong), in order to begin air transport before the end of September this year. It is also heard that the Eurasian and German-Russian Aviation Companies are currently discussing the location for the transfer of airmail, which will likely be a public airfield built in an area bordering China and Russia west of Tacheng, in order to transfer airmail between the two continents of Eurasia there.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Discovered Japanese Soldiers in Disguise in Shanghai West Zhabei</h3>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Investigation Reveals It to be Untrue</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that a rumor spread in the city yesterday afternoon that several Japanese soldiers, dressed in Chinese clothing and disguised as Chinese, went to Zhabei in western Shanghai and acted suspiciously. The Zhabei public discovered this and surrounded them. After discovering this, the Zhabei Public Security Bureau dispatched multiple police officers to escort the Japanese soldiers out of the country. A reporter specifically went to the municipal government last night to inquire. It was said that this matter originated from a certain Western evening newspaper today (i.e., yesterday). The municipal government has sent people to investigate. In fact, nothing of the sort occurred.</p>
<h3>After the Northeastern Postal Rights Were Infringed Upon</h3>
<p>▲ More Than a Thousand Postal Workers Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>▲ Anti-Propaganda by a Japanese Newspaper</p>
<p>Northeastern postal personnel, since the postal blockade, have been unable to move freely due to being under strict Japanese surveillance. Liaoning and Shenyang postal workers, after negotiations between the director of the regional administration, Ba Lidi, and the puppet government, obtained passports and entered the pass one after another. Recently, the British Consul in the Jilin and Heilongjiang districts protested to the Japanese side, and postal workers in that area will now gradually enter the pass as well. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>▲ Total Number of Employees Entering the Pass According to current investigations, the number of postal workers from outside the pass who have arrived is as follows: in Tianjin, 800 workers from the Liaoning and Shenyang districts and 110 workers from the Jilin and Heilongjiang districts; in Beiping, 156 workers from the Liaoning and Shenyang districts and 37 workers from the Jilin and Heilongjiang districts; in Qingdao, 39 workers from the Liaoning and Shenyang districts and 3 workers from the Jilin and Heilongjiang districts; in Shanghai, 21 workers from the Liaoning and Shenyang districts and 8 workers from the Jilin and Heilongjiang districts. In total, 1,164 people have arrived. More are continuing to arrive today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ British Protest to the Japanese Postal workers in the Jilin and Heilongjiang districts are under very strict surveillance, and even the right to communicate is obstructed. The director of the regional postal service, an Englishman named Smith, sought assistance from the British Consulate in the area due to various restrictions imposed by the Japanese side. The British Consul then protested to the Japanese and the puppet government, and only then did they have some freedom. The Shanghai General Post Office is now able to receive telegrams from Smith in the Jilin and Heilongjiang districts, stating that personnel from Jilin and Heilongjiang will also be able to leave the area outside the pass in the near future. ▲ Japanese Slanderous Propaganda Regarding the Northeastern postal blockade, the Japanese Osaka Asahi Shimbun engaged in aggressive propaganda yesterday, involving various countries in an attempt to create an international issue. The newspaper's headline was "Diplomatic Documents Sent to the Three Northeastern Provinces Detained by Tianjin, May Become an International Issue." The content briefly stated that since the Ministry of Transportation of the National Government ordered post offices throughout China to suspend postal services to the Three Northeastern Provinces, diplomatic documents from various consulates stationed in Fengtian have also not been received. The various consulates attach great importance to the National Government's actions, and if this continues, it will undoubtedly become a significant international issue, etc. The General Post Office immediately telegraphed the Tianjin Post Office for clarification. The Tianjin Post Office replied that the entire incident was a deliberate attempt by the Japanese side to engage in anti-propaganda in order to alienate our country from international sentiment, and that documents related to diplomatic matters are still being delivered by any means possible.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Zhenhai Warship Returns to Qingdao</h3>
<p>The Northeastern Navy Zhenhai warship, which transported Northeastern naval cadets to Shanghai this time, has been here for several days. It has been feted by naval personnel in Shanghai. The ship has now been ordered to sail back to Qingdao and departed from Shanghai yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Incense Industry Labor-Management Conditions The Social Bureau's Mediation Was Ineffective Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Management Agrees to Generally Increase Wages by Three Cents</p>
<p>▲ Second Mediation Set for the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>After accepting the advice of party and government agencies to resume work, incense industry workers in the city had their labor-management conditions formally mediated by the Social Bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday, with the Incense Industry Workers' Union, the Incense Industry Guild, and representatives from the management, Zhu Jiamo, and the labor side, Shi Zhiqin and Liu Qiming, attending. Li Weineng from the Municipal Party Headquarters was also present. Zhu Guilin, Chairman of the Social Bureau, presided, and Wang Zhiqin recorded. The chairman began by stating that the dispute had been advised by party and government agencies for the workers to resume work first, and that the labor-management conditions would be handled in accordance with the law. He now hoped that both labor and management would take a step back in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. The management stated (the incense industry has been suffering losses for years, reaching a critical point, leading to a gradual increase in unemployed workers. The old wages were not unified, such as stipulating four jiao and two fen for local workers and four jiao and eight fen for migrant workers, but in reality, the smaller workshops did not comply, inevitably affecting larger management. They hoped that wages would be unified in order to manage the business). The labor side stated (various management indiscriminately hire apprentices, leading to an increase in workers. Management then took the opportunity to dismiss older workers, which is why there are so many unemployed workers. The current wages of the workers are insufficient to maintain their livelihood, and they demand a 40% increase in wages). The discussion then began. The management agreed to increase wages by three silver cents per person per day. The labor side demanded a minimum increase of 20% (i.e., nine fen and six li). The management representatives felt that the matter was significant and needed to be considered before responding, so there was still no result. Finally, the chairman announced that a second mediation would be convened again at 9:00 AM on the 11th.</p>
<h3>The Hexing Tobacco Factory Labor Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>▲ Dismissal Compensation Paid by Management</p>
<p>The Hexing Tobacco Factory on Tongzhou Road in the city used the excuse of sluggish business to dismiss 11 union officials. The Social Bureau approved an order for the management to reinstate the workers, but the factory owner consistently refused. The 4th District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union felt that the case had been delayed for too long, and the workers' suffering was self-evident. They sought a swift resolution and went to the Municipal Social Bureau to petition, demanding that personnel be dispatched promptly along with the Municipal Party Headquarters to negotiate with the management. After receiving the report, the Social Bureau, considering the matter a violation of government orders, dispatched Zhu Guilin at 2:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by Zhong Quan from the Municipal Party Headquarters, along with all the unemployed workers, to negotiate. As a result, both labor and management agreed that the factory would pay each person dismissal compensation, resolving the matter and dispersing at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai County Representative Assembly Opens</h3>

<h3>Family Members of Anti-Japanese Soldiers Request Investigation into the Whereabouts of Liang Guoyou</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from Liang Zuo of No. 2, Duanhua Lane, Heye Second Lane, Xiguan, Guangzhou, stating that his friend Yu Rongji, who went to Nanjing from Guangzhou to find his son, had not been found. He passed through Shanghai on June 12th. Hearing that your association and various circles held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers, he thought that the dead were still blessed, and the living must be able to help investigate. His son, Liang Guoyou, was dispatched to Nanxiang and Liuhe after the 88th fake anti-Japanese war. On June 21st, he received a letter from the 88th Division in Nanjing, stating that Gao Zhisong saw Guoyou being wounded in the waist at Yanjiazhai and sent to Da Chang and then to a hospital in Shanghai, but he did not know which hospital. There has been no news of him ever since. Human life is like ants, and it is painful to say so. Therefore, he specifically implores your association to be generous and righteous to help investigate clearly, so that the separation of death and life can be known. He is extremely grateful, etc. After receiving the letter, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce handed it over to the 50th Shanghai Boy Scout Regiment to investigate with the Red Cross. Yesterday, the Red Cross replied that the association had thoroughly checked the list of wounded soldiers in the Shanghai war and found no person named Liang Guoyou.</p>
<h3>Reactionary Elements Riot at the White Russian Newspaper Office</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 PM on the 6th of this month, over 20 young men gathered at the Chira Russian-language newspaper office, run by White Russians, at No. 551 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. They threw stones and soda bottles into the office, shattering the glass windows, and shouted slogans of "Down with the White Russians" while distributing communist leaflets. Western Constable Dou Make and Chinese Constable No. 277, along with Russian firefighter Dada Lev, arrived and arrested Tang Xiangsheng from Jiangbei, Wang Aqing from Ningbo, Le Abang, and three others, along with stones, broken bottles, and leaflets, and took them to the police station for investigation. The details have been reported in various newspapers. Because this case involved politics, the police sent it to the Higher Third Sub-Court for investigation yesterday. Presiding Judge Lu sat in the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. Yao Zhaodi, the police lawyer, explained the case and prosecuted them in accordance with Articles 160 and 3801 of the Criminal Law and Articles 26 of the Law on Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China. Arno Erdu, the editor-in-chief of the Russian-language newspaper and the plaintiff, was represented by lawyer Plei Mei and appeared in court to recount the previous events. Upon interrogation, Tang confessed to pulling a rickshaw, and Wang and Le confessed to working as coppersmiths at the Huili Auto Shop. At this point, the court prohibited public attendance because the case was related to politics, and the details of the interrogation could not be recorded. It is heard that the court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody pending a scheduled retrial.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Conducts a Thorough Investigation into the Case of Inferior Rice Sold in Bulk</h3>
<p>▲ Red Seal Trademarks are All Sold by Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>▲ More than 100,000 Bags Stockpiled in the Yukang Warehouse</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a report from someone who signed as the "Traitor Merchant Investigation Team" about Shu Zhanyuan selling Japanese rice in bulk and immediately handed it over to the Commercial Affairs Section for investigation. Later, the Rice Trade Guild held a meeting to prove his innocence. The team then sent a detailed letter to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, pointing out the Japanese rice trademarks and the location of the stockpiled goods, requesting a thorough investigation. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce considered the matter to be of great importance and that both truth and falsehood should be thoroughly investigated in order to reveal the truth. Based on the original letter, it has sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. The original letter is recorded below. Respected Sirs, In our previous letter, we reported that the wicked traitor merchant Shu Yuanzhanyuan was selling Japanese rice in bulk. Our team members were filled with hope, believing that your association would take strict action. However, one day later, we saw a news report in the newspapers that the Rice Trade Guild was defending Shu Zhanyuan, and we have not heard of any action taken by your association. We were extremely astonished. An investigation found that Shu Zhanyuan made his fortune by selling Japanese rice in bulk, which is known to everyone in the industry. Today, the Rice Trade Guild only sent people to investigate the Rentai Company, Santai, Kaitai, and various rice shops once and immediately stated that the shops had no dealings with Japanese merchants and were not selling rice in bulk. We do not know by what method they investigated to achieve this hasty result. They also said that they had repeatedly reviewed the account books of the Rentai Three Rice Shops and found no evidence of bulk sales. However, Shu Zhanyuan was already present at the meeting at the same time. With only a few words, he still wanted to ask for justice. If we are not foolish, who would not know the situation inside? Afterwards, Shu Zhanyuan even dared to collude with one or two unscrupulous elements in the press, using news policies to deceive the eyes and ears of all circles. The Rice Trade Guild even published advertisements to prove that he was definitely not a traitorous merchant, which is even more astonishing. How can such a major event of bulk transporting Japanese rice be allowed to escape the law and cover the eyes and ears of the world with just a few lines of advertisements and a news story? Our team members have no gratitude or resentment towards this traitorous merchant, and we will definitely not make groundless accusations. Now that the Rice Trade Guild has proven that the traitorous merchant has absolutely no bulk sales of Japanese rice, if we continue to make empty statements, we will definitely not be convinced by the traitorous merchant or the guild. Based on our team's investigation, the Red Seal trademarks and DS trademarks sold by Rentai Company and the four lines of shops under the traitorous merchant's control, may we ask which country's merchants sell them? The traitorous merchant still has more than 100,000 bags in stock, all stockpiled in the Yukang warehouse in Xinzha. The traitorous merchant, feeling that the external situation is not good, sends people to repackage them with other trademarks day and night, secretly transporting them. If your association does not immediately send personnel to investigate after receiving this letter, it will be too late, and nothing will be found. The gentlemen of your association will become sinners for all time. Furthermore, the procedure of the Rice Trade Guild's investigation of Rentai is also highly questionable. How can the account books be relied upon in the case of traitorous merchants selling inferior goods in bulk? If traitorous merchants privately imported inferior goods, would they boldly write in the account books every day, "So many inferior goods were imported on such and such day, and so many inferior goods were imported on such and such day"? How could there be such a thing in the world? The members of the guild are also from the rice industry. How could they not even know this? Now they knowingly do wrong, using the excuse of checking the accounts to muddle through. It can truly be said that they are recklessly bold and willing to help the wicked. The destruction of the country will surely be brought about by such people. As for the investigation methods, there are also many aspects. Personnel should be sent to secretly collect samples of the rice for public inspection, and the names of the ships transporting the rice, the dates of arrival, and the brands and quantities loaded are all recorded by customs and can be reviewed. Absolutely do not allow them to be obscured in the slightest. Also, once the details of the bulk amount and the people the other party traded with are thoroughly investigated, which is right and wrong, which is a traitorous merchant and which is not a traitorous merchant, it should not be difficult to reveal the truth. There is one more point. If the traitorous merchant has a clear conscience, why not submit all the bills of lading to the guild for verification? Now, they are merely checking the account books and calling it a day, which is truly astonishing. No wonder that after it was revealed in the newspapers, the industry was angered, and all circles were in an uproar. Even if it is inconvenient to call the guild suspicious, the association's mishandling is indeed undeniable. Moreover, if this traitorous merchant is allowed to sell Japanese rice in bulk in this way and obtain a certificate from the guild and then be able to do as they please, and then various industries follow suit, the impact is huge, and the relationship is great. The future is not unspeakable. If your association believes that the Rice Guild's handling of the Shu Zhanyuan case is appropriate, you can stop talking about resisting goods in the future, and the impact will be that various guilds can testify, and absolutely no inferior goods can be found on the market. Alas, how sad. Your association leads the merchants, and their love for the country should be second to none. For the present plan, it seems that a special review committee should be formed by jointly selecting impartial people from the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Guild and the Rice Guild to handle the matter strictly in order to reveal the truth. As for the members of the Rice Trade Guild, they should keep themselves clean, avoid suspicion, and not ask questions. Otherwise, if they continue to protect them repeatedly, there are many powerful people in the community who will definitely not be able to forgive them. Also, although there are no major flaws in the handling of the Tongxing firm by the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Guild, it is not thorough enough and should be strictly handled to warn against illegal activities. Alas, the country is in such a difficult situation, and there is no conscience to speak of. Holding a pen to describe this, blood and tears flow together. That traitorous merchant Shu Yuanzhanyuan, ask yourself in the quiet of the night, how can you face your ancestors, how can you face the 19th Route Army that shed blood in Shanghai? If you continue to use insidious means to try to cover the eyes and ears of the world with one hand, you are truly not worth being eaten by dogs. How should your association handle this matter? Please announce it clearly in the newspapers and do not delay any longer. We are very fortunate, very fortunate. Also, our team has found considerable evidence, and once the special review committee is established, we will submit it to your association to assist in the verification and handling of the case. Combined statement, This is above the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Traitor Merchant Investigation Turn, August 8th.</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Proposes Improving Water Supply Methods</h3>
<p>▲ Recovering Municipal Expenses Through Public Bonds</p>
<p>▲ Implementing Metered Billing with Existing Rates for a One-Year Trial</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession, in a proposal to improve water supply methods, sent a letter yesterday to the Secretary of the Public Works Department, stating: We hereby inform you that the Shanghai Waterworks Company previously notified landlords of the cancellation of bundled water rate contracts, setting a deadline to force the signing of metered contracts under threat of water disconnection. This Association reported the matter to your bureau on June 27th. Recently, the Waterworks Company has further notified residents that water meters have been installed at their premises to measure water consumption and that water bills will be calculated based on meter readings from July 1st onwards. Since the bundled water rate contracts have not been cancelled by mutual agreement, they remain legally valid. The Waterworks Company's unilateral notification, forcing landlords to switch to metered billing by a set deadline, is extremely unreasonable. Whether installing water meters is feasible remains questionable. Based on the experience of general users, water prices increase significantly after meter installation, far exceeding the bundled rates. According to a report from Qinyu Company, located in Qinyu Li, east of Yangshupu Bridge, there are 67 houses, each with a monthly rent ranging from eleven to fourteen yuan, totaling 887 yuan per month. The water bill for May (bundled rate) was 61.85 yuan. However, the Waterworks Company's bill (calculated by meter) for the period ending June 25th, showed a consumption of 787,000 gallons, costing 431.81 yuan. Comparing the two, the metered rate is seven times higher than the bundled rate. Furthermore, according to a report from Jingji Company at 1809 Yangshupu Road, the monthly bundled water rate was 45.40 yuan. The Waterworks Company's bill for the period ending June 25th was 127.81 yuan, an increase of three times. Based on these two examples and other reports, the following three points are strongly supported: (1) According to Mr. Hill and the Waterworks Company, the key to the metered system is to prevent waste. However, after the Waterworks Company implemented the metered system on a trial basis, residents' water consumption did not decrease. This shows that the metered system has not encouraged users to save water. If the Waterworks Company adopts overly strict measures to restrict water usage, it may harm public health, requiring careful attention. (2) The water rates set by the Public Works Department and the Waterworks Company on December 24, 1931, clearly increase the burden on impoverished users. For example, tenants in Qinyu Li pay a monthly rent of only eleven or fourteen yuan, but the metered water bill requires them to pay as much as 6.40 yuan per month. How can they afford this? (3) The current water rates charged by the Waterworks Company are too high for the general public. According to Shanghai custom, landlords collect water fees from tenants on behalf of the Waterworks Company. Therefore, most houses in Shanghai are rented out with water included. For decades, landlords have followed this practice, making investment budgets at the beginning of their property ownership, based on the assumption that water fees account for 5% of the rent. However, in the past few years, water fees have been increased repeatedly, from 5% to 7.5%. While water fees have increased, rents have not increased proportionally, mainly because the current living conditions are extremely difficult, and rent increases for old houses have become impossible in recent years. Considering the above two examples, after the installation of water meters, water fees suddenly increase several times. In addition to paying land taxes, interest, insurance, repair fees, and depreciation, landlords must also pay 30% to 50% of their rental income as water fees for residents. Their difficult situation is self-evident. If there is no remedy, the real estate business may decline at any time, which would not be beneficial for the region. Furthermore, Mr. Hill and the Waterworks Company believe that the metered system is the only effective way to prevent waste. This Association does not object to this. However, it must be noted that under the current system where landlords collect water fees, the water fee payers are the landlords. Whether the tenants can consider the water price and save water is uncertain. Therefore, to achieve the goal of saving water, the current charging method must be changed. The Waterworks Company should directly collect the water fees from users based on their monthly water consumption, following the example of rent and electricity bills. If landlords are purely concerned with their own interests, the most straightforward way is to announce that they will stop collecting water fees and deduct the 6% water fee and surcharges from the rent, allowing residents to contract with the Waterworks Company themselves. However, after considering their own interests, landlords must also consider the residents. It is well known that the economic capacity of Shanghai residents has been weakened in recent years, and the majority of residents are impoverished. Forcing them to pay high water fees is practically impossible. As a result, residents will either unite to resist the Waterworks Company's profiteering policy or excessively save water, which will harm the health and public hygiene of citizens. This is something that the municipal authorities must pay attention to. Therefore, this Association proposes the following two measures to your bureau: (1) The Public Works Department should begin negotiations with the Waterworks Company to recover municipal operations. The costs can be financed by issuing 6% public bonds. If necessary, landlords can at least purchase a portion of them. (2) Water fees should temporarily remain calculated at 7.5% of the rent for a period of one year. During this year, the monthly water consumption of households with water meters should be recorded to obtain accurate data and revise the fair price of monthly water consumption, to maintain the Waterworks Company's original capital dividend. This matter concerns local security and the livelihood of the people. We respectfully hope you will consider and implement these proposals. To the Secretary of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Abandoned Military Supplies in the War Zone to be Transported to the Gaochang Temple Military Depot for Storage</h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Police Bureau Ordered Subordinates to Transfer Them</p>
<p>According to the Pacific News Agency, the Municipal Police Bureau, concerned about the frequent explosions of abandoned artillery shells in the Zhabei war zones, causing injuries to innocent people, has ordered its subordinates to quickly search all districts under their jurisdiction for various abandoned artillery shells, bombs, hand grenades, and various firearms, and to immediately send them to the General Bureau for transfer to the arsenal of the military factory for safekeeping, in order to prevent the recurrence of such tragic events. It is reported that the Fourth District and Second Precinct of the Bureau's Zhabei branch recently delivered to the Bureau five large artillery shells, seven small artillery shells, and twenty-one hand grenades. The First Precinct of the Fifth District delivered an airplane bomb. The Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District delivered three damaged 79 rifles, 180 various bullets, four hand grenades, and other military supplies. Huang Youyin of the Bureau's First Section, Armament Division, dispatched police officers yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. to transport the seized military supplies to the Shanghai Military Factory Arsenal at Gaochang Temple for safekeeping, along with official documents.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Urges Rubber Merchants Not to Undercut Each Other</h3>
<p>▲ A Sole Agent Should Be Established in Each Region of Southeast Asia</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently received a letter from Xue Fenshi, Manager of Yi Hua Commercial Co., Ltd. in Manila, Philippines, which stated: "Respectfully, I have heard that the rubber shoe manufacturers in Shanghai are very developed, and most of the shoes sold in the Philippines are manufactured in Guangzhou and transshipped through Hong Kong. Last year, more than 6,000 dozen pairs were sold in the Philippines. I believe that the sales of this product in the Philippines will increase year by year. Since 1930, when Japanese manufacturers began imitating American rubber shoes and selling them at low prices to defeat American products, Chinese merchants have been forced by the trend to sell Japanese rubber shoes, because their products are well-suited to the psychology of the Filipinos and have economic characteristics. Therefore, Japanese goods sell very well in the Philippines, which is why their commerce and industry have developed so rapidly. Moreover, Japanese manufacturers conduct in-depth research on overseas trade at all times. Small and medium-sized wholesalers and importers tend to compete at a loss, so Japanese manufacturers would rather sacrifice short-term profits than deal directly with such merchants, fearing that these merchants will misrepresent their products, making them unsalable in the future. Their sole purpose is to sign contracts with large-capital importers, granting them exclusive agency rights, and have these importers wholesale the products, in order to avoid the disadvantages of competition. Since the boycott of Japanese goods last year, Chinese rubber shoes have seized the opportunity to achieve large sales, which is very gratifying. However, based on my experience, some manufacturers have not only failed to make a profit, but have also suffered losses. For example, our company shipped several batches from Hong Kong, but was affected by the disorderly unloading of other companies and suffered losses. If Chinese goods continue in this way, it may turn joy into worry. I hope that Chinese rubber shoe manufacturers will quickly improve their overseas trade methods. If they can adopt the methods of Japanese manufacturers, I can confidently say that Chinese rubber shoes can permanently defeat American and Japanese goods in the Philippines. However, if the manufacturers do not quickly coordinate with each other and select well-reputed importers as their exclusive agents, the competition in the future will be even fiercer than before, and these Chinese goods, which should be selling well, will become unsalable, which would be a pity. I cannot bear to see Chinese goods fail. I respectfully request that you convene all rubber shoe manufacturers to discuss the selection of one well-reputed importer in each region of Southeast Asia (such as American, British, and Dutch territories) to be the exclusive agent for that region, in order to avoid the worry of Chinese goods failing to thrive overseas. At this time of fierce commercial warfare, I hope that the Chinese rubber shoe manufacturers in Shanghai will not imitate the Hong Kong Nam Pak Hongs, which accept commissions from anyone and everyone." The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the self-destructive competition among domestic rubber merchants in Southeast Asia will inevitably lead to mutual losses in the future, which is not beneficial to Chinese goods. Yesterday, it forwarded the contents of the letter to the Rubber Products Industry Association of the city to inform the manufacturers to pay attention and avoid repeating the same mistakes.</p>
<h3>Branch of the Xizang Road Contagious Disease Hospital Established</h3>
<p>▲ 9 Du Mei Road</p>
<p>The Xizang Road Contagious Disease Hospital is already full of patients and cannot accommodate more. Allowing them to be transferred to other hospitals would be time-consuming and could lead to danger. Recognizing this, the hospital, through the introduction of Mr. Yao Chang'an, contacted Mr. Li Ruoheng, manager of Wing On Real Estate Company, to borrow the address at 9 Du Mei Road as a temporary branch. Mr. Li generously agreed, and the branch has already been filled as soon as it opened. The Du Mei Road address is spacious, with lush trees and fresh air, which is truly a blessing for the patients and a generous gift from Mr. Li of Wing On.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Contagious Disease Hospital Held a Supplementary Opening Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Town Public Security Road Contagious Disease Hospital was destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. Recently, the hospital's director, Wang Han, and directors, Cai Xiangsun, Jin Bingzhang, Zhang Xinliang, Gu Shanzhang, and others, in order to prevent epidemics after the war in the area, raised funds to rebuild the hospital. With the introduction of Mr. Quan Zhiren, Xu Bingji undertook the contract at a low price. In the meantime, a temporary clinic was first established in Caiyuan, which has been convenient for the locals since its opening. It is reported that the hospital's buildings have now been completed, and the opening ceremony was held yesterday at 3:00 p.m. Those present from the Party and government agencies included Hu Hongji, representing Mayor Wu and also Director of the Health Bureau (represented by Section Chief Shen), Han Shichang of the Red Swastika Society, Dai Hong'en, Director of the Fifth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau, Lu Zhengyu, Commander of the Jiangwan Defense Corps, Wu Chuiying, Deputy Commander, and directors Zhang Xinliang, Gu Shanzhang, Jin Shusheng, and local gentry and merchants Zhang Yunjie, Li Xiaoyan, and more than 30 others. Director Wang Han presided over the ceremony. First, Director Wang gave the opening remarks, followed by Cai Xiangsun (represented by Gu Shanzhang), representing the board of directors, who reported on the hospital's past history and the process of restoring the hospital this time. Representatives from the Health Bureau then delivered speeches, and guest Mr. Liu Daokui gave a speech. After the meeting, photographs were taken and refreshments were served, and the attendees toured the facility before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the Physicians' Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Physicians' Association held its ninth meeting of the sixth executive committee yesterday. The attendees included (executive committee members) Cheng Hanzhang, Jiang Zhenxun, Xia Shenchu, Wang Qizhang, Liu Zhigang, Xie Yunshou, Pang Jingzhou, and (supervisory committee members) Xu Naili and Zhu Qiluo. Jiang Zhenxun served as acting chairman. The following matters were discussed: (1) The Ministry of Interior Health Administration sent a letter to the association informing it that the revised method for issuing physician certificates had been approved. It was resolved to print and distribute the letter and the revised method to the committee members for reference. (2) Whether to proceed with the Physicians' Association Law and the association's registration with the Ministry was discussed. It was resolved to proceed with both matters immediately, and to submit a request to the Municipal Health Bureau to forward the Ministry registration matter to the Ministry. (3) The China Credit Institute inquired about the death of a patient named Huo Chengzhi, who suffered from appendicitis and died in Tongren Hospital. It was resolved that since the hospital's physician, Dr. Gao, was not a member of the association, the matter could not be handled, and a reply should be sent immediately. (4) The Weiguo Martyrs' Family Relief Association requested fundraising donations. It was resolved to ask all members to make donations at the autumn general meeting. (5) The National Physicians' Federation sent a letter requesting local discussions on the unique circumstances and contributions to the rationalization of hospital organization, and to provide opinions to the health authorities for collection and implementation. It was resolved that since this proposal was originally made by the association, the original proposer, Jiang Zhenxun, should draft a statement of opinion. (6) Shi Ruxiong, director of the Huilu Yang Hospital Huilu Civilian Obstetrics Hospital, and Yu Songyun of the Zhongde Obstetrics Hospital, sent letters stating that, to popularize postpartum care for the poor after the war, all officially impoverished pregnant women would receive free delivery services at the hospital, and requested that all members be notified and widely publicized to benefit the public. It was resolved to comply with the request. (7) Physicians Wang Wanbai, Wu Zhibu, and Sheng Meiting applied for membership. It was resolved to approve their applications after review.</p>
<h3>Electrical and Silk Weaving Association Appeals for Remedial Measures for International Trade</h3>
<p>▲ Requesting Rebate of Artificial Silk Import Tax on Exported Silk Crepe</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical and Silk Weaving Factory Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the International Trade Association, which stated: "Respectfully, the Customs' increase in the import tax on artificial silk went into effect on August 4th. The purpose of this tax increase is to protect the sales of domestic natural silk. Not only are merchants happy to comply, but our association members also agree. However, a considerable amount of artificial silk interwoven products are exported to India and Southeast Asian ports. In recent years, these products have been challenging Japanese artificial silk. Now that the import tax on artificial silk has increased, the cost of artificial silk interwoven products will naturally be higher, which will greatly affect sales in India and Southeast Asia, making it even more difficult to promote them. To uphold the government's good intentions in increasing the import tax on artificial silk and to safeguard the development of domestic industrial products, we propose that your association forward a request to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance that for artificial silk fabrics and artificial silk interwoven fabrics woven by domestic factories that are exported overseas, the artificial silk import tax collected should be refunded in its original amount, to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain industry. In this way, the government's tax revenue will not be reduced, and foreign trade can also be smooth."</p>
<h3>Various Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Farms Petition for Exemption from Inspection of Improved Silkworm Seeds Upon Entry</h3>
<p>▲ The Commodity Inspection Bureau Has Sent a Letter to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Construction Bureaus for Discretionary Handling</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry recently received a petition from the Silkworm Department of Nanjing Ling University, Wuben Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Farm, and others, stating that when qualified silkworm seeds that have been inspected enter the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, they must be sent to the silkworm industry regulatory offices of each province for review and additional certification, with a fee of one cent per sheet charged, which is close to extortionate taxation and conflicts with the Ministry of Industry's Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Regulatory Rules. They requested that the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Construction Bureaus be informed to exempt improved silkworm seeds from entry inspection, in order to maintain the lifeline of the silkworm industry. After receiving the petition, the Bureau believed that improving silk starts with improving silkworm eggs, and it sympathized with the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Industrial Bureaus' regulation of substandard silkworm eggs as an essential step in promoting improved silk. However, the farms stated that the regulation of substandard seeds relies on inspections during the breeding process at the seed manufacturing farms and on the examination of moth corpses. Once the seeds have been produced, even if they are inspected, it is impossible to distinguish their quality. They also stated that from the acid treatment to the hatching period of autumn seeds, there are only seven to ten days. After the acid treatment, drying and sorting take another four to five days. From the south to the silkworm seed distribution points in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, even in areas with convenient transportation, it takes two or three days. In reality, it is impossible to transport them to the regulatory offices for stamping, which would delay the process. All of these statements are factual. If the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces want to prevent the import of substandard silkworm seeds that have not been inspected, they can clearly prohibit the entry of such silkworm seeds and conduct strict inspections. Silkworm seeds that have been inspected by government agencies and bear a qualified certificate should be allowed to be sold anywhere without regulation, to benefit seed merchants. It is reported that copies of the original petitions from each farm have been sent to the Zhejiang Construction Bureau and the Jiangsu Industrial Bureau for discretionary handling.</p>
<h3>The Zhu Shaoyi Case Disputes Are Escalating</h3>
<p>▲ Anti-Zhu Faction Workers Beat Up Neutral Faction Workers</p>
<p>A labor dispute arose among the car workers of the China General Omnibus Company in protest against the car department director, Zhu Shaoyi. Zhu Shaoyi then filed a lawsuit against the labor union leaders, Lu Jiyun and Fu Chongde, for allegedly posting slogans and distributing leaflets that insulted him. During the litigation, a group of workers published a statement claiming that the posting of slogans, etc., was not the opinion of all workers, which aroused the resentment of the opposing workers, who denounced them as lackeys. Recently, three car workers, Zhang Ruoyu, Hu Ruizhang, and Zhan Yongyi, were beaten up by workers from the anti-Zhu Shaoyi faction on South Railway Station Road. Zhang and others then went to the local court to have their injuries examined. Yesterday, the court ordered the defendants, Jiang Yongsheng, Zhu Bingkui, and Sun Duoyi, and nine others to appear in court. The case prosecutor, Yang, conducted a preliminary hearing and ordered Jiang Yongsheng and Zhu Bingkui to provide bail, while the others were released pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Another Large Department Store Appears on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>▲ Initiated by Hong Kong's Da Sun Company</p>
<p>▲ Located Between Lloyd Road and Xizang Road</p>
<p>The corner of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road in this city, originally the site of Rong Changxiang Yileye and the Zhonghua Photo Studio at Lloyd Road, was previously rumored to have been purchased by the Dahua Department Store organized by overseas Chinese. In fact, it is the Shanghai Da Sun Company. The company was initiated by Hong Kong's Da Sun Company, and was established by shareholders of the Hong Kong Da Sun Company and related parties. It purchased the above property from a major real estate owner in this city, Mr. Cheng. It faces Nanjing Road to the south, extends from Lloyd Road to the east, Xizang Road to the west, and the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to the north, covering an area of over two public acres. A fence has been built and construction of a nine-story department store will begin soon. The equipment will be very new. In addition to ordinary elevators, each floor will have the latest electric escalators, which have never been seen in Shanghai. A twelve-story state-of-the-art hotel will also be built. Various domestic goods factories will be established at another location. The Hong Kong Da Sun Company was established by overseas Chinese from Australia in the early years of the Republic of China. In South China, it is known as one of the three major companies, along with Sincere and Wing On. In Guangzhou, the architecture of the department store and the affiliated Asia Hotel is as high as dozens of floors, towering into the sky, and still ranks first in the city. When the new buildings of the company and the affiliated hotel are completed in the future, they will undoubtedly add a new dimension to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Li Zhong Li Door Keeper Murder Case</h3>
<p>▲ Tenants in the Alley Organize a Support Association for the Tragedy</p>
<p>The Li Zhong Li alleyway, located on Yuezhou Road in Hongkou, where the doorkeeper murdered the tenant, Zhou A'yu, has caused a sensation throughout Shanghai. The tenants of the alleyway have organized a support association for the tragedy, petitioning the municipal government, the municipal party committee, and various organizations for assistance. They have also hired three major lawyers, Yu Hualong, Chen Honglai, and Peng Qixiu, to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>The Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Supports the Aviation Association</h3>
<p>Since the China Aviation Construction Association began operating in the Mainland Commercial Market, it has received strong support from all walks of life. Previously, in order to promote the Association's self-made aircraft program, cooperation with the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association of this city was deemed necessary.

The child's head fell directly into the pot of boiling water. Instantly, the boiling water splashed everywhere. The child's head, face, and neck were all scalded by the boiling water, the skin peeling off and blood flowing. It was a tragic sight resembling a skinned frog. The child was barely breathing.

As Gu Zhenrong was in the hospital with serious injuries and unable to testify, the court ordered a postponement for further investigation. Yesterday morning, the police escorted He to the Fourth Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the victim, Gu Zhenrong, was present in court today and requested to be questioned. Gu Zhenrong testified that the defendant pushed his father to the ground and he went forward to dissuade him. Unexpectedly, the defendant immediately ran to another place, got an iron chisel, and stabbed him repeatedly in the chest, back, arms, and neck. He then took off his clothes to show the old scars and said that the stab to the neck was the most severe and he nearly lost his life. Questioned about this, the defendant said that he was forced to pay rent, which led to a quarrel and scuffle, and that Gu Zhenrong had tightly gripped his testicles, so he had no choice but to stab him with the iron chisel to escape. He asked for understanding. Judge Shen Bingrong ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>China Philanthropic Association's Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>The China Philanthropic Association's circular telegram states: To all newspaper offices nationwide, for the attention of all compatriots, in today's world, material civilization has reached its zenith, leading to a situation where those who strive survive, while those who do not strive are lost in the abyss. International affairs are consequently in a state of urgency. Our China, due to this, externally suffers from the oppression of international imperialism, and internally suffers from the pain of warlord infighting, leading to national economic bankruptcy and the people living in misery. Last year's floods were a disaster. Japanese imperialists seized the opportunity to occupy Shenyang, creating the tragic Eastern Incident. Our weak government, adhering to its consistent policy of non-resistance, watched as the Northeast fell, with no hope of recovery. Regarding the Shanghai Incident, it signed a ceasefire agreement, leading to complete diplomatic failure. Recently, Rehe is in imminent danger, but no military arrangements have been seen. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent, and a second world war is about to erupt from this. How cruel is imperialism, and how cowardly is our government! Their minds are blinded by selfish desires, losing the spirit of human equality and universal love. Recognizing this, this association dares to uphold the spirit of equality and universal love of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and the standpoint of the Three Principles of the People, gathering comrades, vowing to fight to the end with the evil imperialists and their henchmen, and striving for the final survival of our nation, and further pursuing the peace and happiness of humankind. May our compatriots strive together. The China Philanthropic Association bows respectfully.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, On August 5th, your newspaper's news section reported that Chengchang Coal Company was selling Japanese coal. We were very surprised to read this. Our company operates on a small scale, focusing on firewood and charcoal, and has very little coal trading. Moreover, our company has been within the war zone since the January 28th Incident, and business has not yet recovered. It is possible that there is another Chengchang Coal Company. Therefore, we request that you make a correction. Sincerely, Chengchang Coal Company, Broadway Road. August 8th.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Price Good at Three Liang Eight</h3>
<p>▲ The process changed from weakness to firmness. Yesterday's gold price first fell and then rose. The overall market had a difference of eight and a half liang. In the end, it continued to rise by four liang. The opening was low, at 740 liang. Later, large accounts bought aggressively, and the foreign exchange rate improved. A certain bank repeatedly purchased spot goods, totaling about 500 bars, thus spurring on futures. Market sentiment was particularly brisk, frequently rising by eight liang. The market later appeared soft. Afterwards, the market fluctuated by about 46 liang. A detailed record of the day is as follows.</p>

<p>▲ Quiet Afternoon Market: The afternoon market opened at 47 liang and nine qian. Tong Taichang and others all sold out, decreasing slightly to six liang and eight qian.

<h3>Exchange Rate Slightly Fluctuates</h3>
<p>▲ Morning Deficit Followed by Tightening: Loosening Again in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, there were no telegraphs from overseas silver markets. However, yesterday's report showed British prices rising and American prices falling, and the exchange rate continued to decrease slightly. The various exchange rates in the Shanghai market also showed divergent trends. The British gold exchange rate remained unchanged, the US dollar exchange rate fell by 1.25, the French franc fell by two yuan, the German mark decreased by 25, and the Dutch guilder decreased by half a guilder. The Hong Kong and Singapore rates remained unchanged. The intraday British rate was flat and the American rate was strong. The overall rate fluctuated slightly, with a deficit in the morning followed by tightening, and apparent loosening in the afternoon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the British gold exchange rate was even, and the US dollar exchange rate decreased by 0.0625. The gold price changed from weakness to firmness, and bank transactions were quite active, with approximately tens of thousands of pounds in British gold being traded. There was lively dealing between banks. The gold dealers had only slight increases or decreases. There was a total of 7-800,000 US dollars, with a large number of interbank transactions. Most Chinese merchants largely settled to offset short positions, with occasional hedging of exchange coupons. The Maccary also traded British and American exchange rates, buying US dollars at $30.50 for December and selling shillings at 9 pence (totaling 3 yuan, 4 jiao, 8 and a half fen). A record of the day's transactions is as follows.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange Rate Has 125 Differences In the Domestic Market: The selling price for August was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 75. The selling price for November was 9375.

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Unlikely to Improve</h3>
<p>▲ The General Overview of the Market Assembly is Quiet: Although yesterday was Monday, and the banks were open, according to previous conditions, the trend was generally perceived to be fragmented. Transactions and settlements were naturally numerous. Yet who would know that the assembly and transaction situation in the market at the beginning of this week was like the scene during the close, with settlements also not being numerous. The kind of dreary and languid atmosphere was enough to make one sigh with regret. It is certainly impossible to prevent the market from falling. It is truly even more difficult to make the market improve.</p>
<p>▲ The Price of Coins Continues to Soften, and the Split Feels Slightly Superior: (Silver Coins) In the early market, the price of coins fell due to active selling and sluggish buying. As a result, there were few transactions, and the price continued to fall to 6 qian, 8 fen, 7 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, and half a si. The noon market rose by 1 hao and 2 hu and half a si, to 6 qian, 8 fen, and 7 li and half a si. The result was slightly smaller by 2 hao and half a si compared to the previous day. (Silver Split) The early market transfer account and silver split were both 1 qian and 2 fen, seemingly higher by 4 fen compared to the previous day. The noon market dropped slightly by 2 fen, to 1 qian. The bank's listed price was 5 fen, without adding water from beginning to end.</p>
<p>▲ Copper Dollars Increase Mutually: The market price of Little Yang in Jiangnan continued to be smaller by 1 li compared to the previous day, only at 6 qian. The morning and afternoon were the same, and the situation fluctuated without much fluctuation. Transactions were 5,000 jiao in the early market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Little Yang in Guangdong seemingly rose by 1 li in the early market, to 5 qian, 8 fen, 3 li, and half a si. The noon market was slightly smaller by 1 hao and 2 hu and half a si, to 5 qian, 8 fen, 3 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, and half a si. Transactions were 95,000 jiao in the early market and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. 500 copper coins were delivered in length for 431,000 coins. Transactions were particularly numerous, with as many as 55,599,000 coins, and the equivalent silver amount reached 12,900 liang, creating the most recent record.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Settlement News Extremely Cold and Faded: Although yesterday's bank settlement news was a typical booming example, the situation was simple. Chinese merchants settled over 2.9 million bills, foreign merchants settled over 2.6 million, various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous settlements were 7.67 million, telegraphic transfer settlements were 1.2 million, special withdrawals were 2 million, pledge transactions were over 1 million, warehouse withdrawals were 600,000, and warehouse entries were 400,000. The total amount of settlements from money houses and silver public firms was over 29 million, and head settlement accounts were over 5.1 million. Various exchange remittances were settled over 900,000, and the actual amount was settled directly.</p>
<p>▲ Overseas Transactions Were Leisurely and Sales Were Blocked: In the early market, there were only 400,000 overseas exchange and draft bills, and even less in the afternoon, only 240,000. The amount of paper money outside the market was 125,000 in the early market and 60,000 in the afternoon market. The amount of paper money inside the market was 50,000 in the early market and 25,000 in the afternoon market. The amount of bank checks was 45,000 in the early market and 15,000 in the afternoon market. The amount of foreign exchange transactions by banks was 350,000 in the early market and 250,000 in the afternoon market. The amount of settlements between foreign accounts of various banks was over 1.9 million, the amount of paper money recovered and issued was over 2 million, the amount of settlements by money houses was over 6.4 million, the amount of settlements for foreign head accounts was over 1.7 million, and the amount of foreign exchange borrowings in and out was over 1.4 million. The number of overseas pledge transactions was over 800,000, and the number of small money house entries and exits was over 600,000. The long-term sales have been unheard of.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bonds Suddenly Drop Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday (8th), the morning market transactions of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, except for spot goods that are still scarce in and out, only 4,000 yuan were opened for downsizing, demobilization, and the 19th Customs, the rest were not available in the market. The futures fell sharply, and transactions increased slightly. It is estimated that the total turnover between the two rounds of trading was 3.98 million, of which salt tax accounted for 950,000 yuan, and the rest was around 450,000 yuan. Customs duties, downsizing, and 96 were still clear. Speaking of the trend of bond prices, due to the sudden turbulence in the current situation, people's hearts were empty, and demand was weak. Those with goods were eager to sell, which led to a disparity between supply and demand. When the prices of the various prices were initially opened yesterday morning, they all fell rapidly and sharply. The spot goods for downsizing and futures fell by about 1 yuan and 8 jiao, and the rest fell by 78 jiao to 1 yuan and a half or so. After the special price fell, it quickly settled, and there was no significant rise or fall after that, and the future was quite chaotic.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Silver Company)</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the New York stock market was stronger because the price of American wheat rose, and people's hearts were firmer. Buyers came in droves, and several stocks temporarily became scarce goods. Transactions were also brisk. Railroad stocks such as (Union Pacific Railroad) suddenly rose by a little less than ten points. Industrial stocks were traded even more briskly, and prices rose across the board. The most rising stocks were (United Chemical Dyes), up nine points, and (American Telephone and Telegraph), up seven points. Others such as (American Tobacco B), (Aoming Motors), and (Continental Canned Goods) also rose by four or five points. Since the close of the Lausanne Conference, the New York stock market has changed its trend. The belief of American domestic and foreign investors in securities investment is gradually recovering. However, according to a telegram from this Asia Company, short-term investors can take the opportunity to sell this Monday. The Dow Jones Index is attached below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Tends to Rise by Covering Short Positions</h3>
<p>New Sellers Discovered in the Aftermarket</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is trending upward. Due to the continued rise in American cotton prices, and the good demand for yarn in the market, the two gangs from Sichuan and Youtou still have purchases. The market sentiment is firm. Short positions are being covered. The large households see that the bottom goods are weak, so they endure the pain and close their positions. The rising trend in the market is becoming sharper. However, in the afternoon, there was a sudden collapse. The majority of the psychology was probed. There were many rumors in Shanghai. The military situation in Northeast China was tense. The Japanese army in Rehe was still in serious condition. There were quite a few new sellers, and the market fell again.</p>
<p>▲The Initial Bidding Is Good for Two Xu: The initial market opening was because of the rise in American cotton. A large short position was covered. The market atmosphere was stronger. Each month rose one or two, 36, to two liang and one qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the northeast situation was urgent. The atmosphere became even more intense. Each month fell four, eight, and nine qian to one liang. The total transaction volume for the day was 40,550 bales. Checking the sales, Renfeng sold 1,050 bales, Yuantai 950 bales, Taichang 900 bales, Yongchang 1,100 bales, Tonghe 1,150 bales, and Mingde 600 bales. Changfeng bought 1,950 bales, Yichang 1,700 bales, Changji 750 bales, Yukang 850 bales, Tongfu 550 bales, Zhenda 700 bales, and Gengfeng 650 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

According to the statistics of various gangs for the whole day, a total of 1,600 bales were purchased. The market price rose five qian to one liang in the morning, and was flat in the afternoon. The amounts purchased by the various parties are listed below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market: Good in the Morning, Reversal in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning but fell in the afternoon. The market trend was strong. Most people believed that American cotton would rise sharply, and that Wall Street's finances were strong, with stocks soaring, leading to active speculators. However, one manufacturer purchased a large amount of American-grown cotton in Shandong, about tens of thousands of bales, and sold short 12,000 dan of October cotton in the futures market. Some observers believed that American cotton would not rise significantly and sold short, causing the market price to fall sharply in the afternoon, and the situation to loosen. It is estimated that there are 12,179,000 bales. Shandong cotton is being actively opened, and the US government's production estimates tomorrow will greatly shake the world cotton market and have a great impact on the rise and fall of this cotton.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Biao Rises Two Qian: Zheng Biao opened higher in the morning due to bad weather for American cotton. There were more buyers in the market, and each month rose three or four qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that Shandong cotton was being opened, and large households sold off, causing the market to fall sharply, and each month fell two and a half qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 95,500 bales. The largest sellers were Yuanda (10,900 dan), Changji (2,000 dan), Changyu (2,400 dan), Tongxing (2,300 dan), Yifeng (2,100 dan), and Jifeng (2,300 dan). The largest buyers were Changfeng (7,200 dan), Ruida (4,800 dan), Yuanda (5,200 dan), Taixing (2,700 dan), and Yichang (2,600 dan). The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Closing Price Rise/Fall Account Balance Twelve 3170 Up 15 271,500</p>
<p>August 3220 Up 15 89,100 One 3170 Down 20 135,800 October 3180 Down 20 222,700 Total 993,800 November 3170 Down 20 274,700</p>
<p>▲High Cotton Prices Lead to Stagnant Demand from Factories: Due to rising prices, factories are facing stagnant demand for spot cotton. It is estimated that the source is 150 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Shandong American-grown cotton: 32.25. Yong'an purchased 5,000 pieces for delivery to the factory in October.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Cotton Market Trends Upward</h3>
<p>Tianjin News: The Xihe cotton market is trending firmer. Purchases from all parties are going smoothly. Merchants from Shanghai and Japanese merchants are showing signs of prosperity. As the season has reached a period of transition, people are more optimistic than before. The market has risen by five qian to two qian. Yuji Bank bought 476 bales, priced at 23 taels and 5 qian. Qingxi Bank bought 400 bales, priced at 23 taels and 2 qian. Furthermore, the market for American-grown cotton in Xihe is also showing signs of improvement. Purchases from Shanghai merchants continue. Yuji Bank bought 82 bales, priced at 27 taels and 5 qian. The future outlook remains firm.</p>
<h3>Prediction of US Cotton Government Report</h3>
<p>June 6th, New York Electric: The US government's first cotton harvest estimate is scheduled to be released on the 8th. Based on various private estimates, the production situation is predicted to be 67.9% of the normal year, totaling 12,179,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>The market was extremely firm last week. Price declines in the market were ignored because the public firmly believed that American cotton would rise in the near future. As prices rose, local factories continued to sell cotton cloth. Export demand decreased due to the narrow price difference between American and Indian cotton. Europe was almost completely stagnant. As for spot goods, business was still good due to continuous purchases by factories. Japanese transporters also shipped out large quantities. The following is a statistical appendix for the past week (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1931 1932</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1st 3,374 1,999</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 655 770</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1st 2,372 913</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 579 146</p>
<p>Shipped to China 422 209</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 1,344 520</p>
<p>Other regions 27 38</p>
<h3>Food: Scarce Rice Arrives Downriver, Sales Active</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday, the sources of goods from various Shanghai South gangs were slightly less, about ten boats or so. Sales in urban and rural areas are becoming more active. Changxi Northern Japonica rice and Sutong gang rice slightly increased in warehouses. Warehouse owners increased prices by three or four jiao in the morning. Early rice and foreign Du Jian rice were continuously handled by broker gangs, following up by one or two jiao. New Japonica rice arrivals and sales were break-even, and prices remained the same. Thin rice showed no honor or disgrace, slightly showing signs of downstream movement.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, there were thirteen or fourteen ships from Changxi, Xianzi, and other Northern gangs. Transactions on this street were not very active. Changshu, Wuxi, Kunshan, Jiangyin, Liyang and other white Japonica rice all increased by two jiao. Nearly a hundred dan of early and late rice were sold in small quantities, with no rise or fall in price. Very few first-class goods were available. The opening of the market was fixed, and the total volume of rice opened in river factories throughout the city was 3,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Rises in the Morning, Falls in the Evening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice continued the previous day's upward trend, and market sentiment was very good. Furthermore, Northern merchants bought Saigon rice, and Nanjing merchants bought Xiaojiao rice, each going for more than a thousand bags, and prices gradually rose by five to eight fen. Xiaojiao rice reached nine yuan and eight jiao. Subsequently, it was reported that Xiang rice would soon be unbanned, and the harvests in Jiangxi and Anhui provinces were also good, and it was also possible for them to come to Shanghai. Warehouse owners on this street immediately sold off, and the market quickly fell back. Xiaojiao rice fell from nine yuan and seven jiao and one fen to six jiao and seven fen. Medium-grade rice fell from nine yuan and six jiao to four jiao and a half. Old Xiaojiao opened at nine yuan and three jiao, with a total of 4,000 bags opened. One Saigon rice opened at 2,500 bags, priced at ten yuan, zero jiao, three fen to two jiao and seven fen.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Rises Due to Dry Weather</h3>
<p>The milling industry both inside and outside Shanghai has a strong intention to purchase.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed signs of rebounding, with the quoted price of foreign wheat rising by eight to five jiao or so. As a result, near and far terms opened higher, rising two or three fen from the weekend closing price. The activity of purchases both inside and outside the industry was partly driven by foreign wheat and partly by the drought, which has affected rice fields. Based on this situation, it is showing prosperity. However, large factories, due to the accumulation of flour and the worsening situation in the North, are deeply afraid of sales obstruction, so they are gradually releasing large quantities. Therefore, at the close, prices softened slightly. As a result, this month rose two fen compared to the previous week, September rose one fen and seven li and a half, October rose two fen and a half, November rose three fen, December rose two fen and a half, and January rose two fen.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Buying Spree Reached a Peak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, each month saw another surge, with the quoted price of foreign wheat rising by a huge five to eight jiao. The general public was very active. It was heard that the brokers close to the factories were particularly eager to buy, and the intention of local gangs to purchase was also very strong, with No. 43 entering about 50 cars and No. 28 entering more than 10 cars. Therefore, near and far terms rose step by step, and the increase was very strong. Looking at the future, if foreign wheat does not turn back, the wheat market should be able to hold steady. As a result, this month rose four fen, September rose seven fen, October rose nine fen, and November and December rose eight fen. The spot wheat market is still not prosperous, and sales are also stagnant. However, due to the color of the wheat, the opening price is bullish, with Suqian wheat opening at three taels and five qian and Yaowan wheat opening at three taels and six qian.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: American Merchants Actively Purchasing White Factory Silk</h3>
<p>American sales of Chinese silk have been stagnant for a long time due to the impact of low-priced Japanese silk. Recently, due to the increasingly poor quality of Japanese silk, which cannot be used alone to weave silk, silk weaving factories have begun to purchase white factory silk. At the end of last week, New York sent accounts for more than 1,000 bales. Because the prices were not high, after several negotiations, Qianli, Lanle, Bibei, and others sold 300 bales of B-grade, 13 to 22-thread white factory silk for the current and upcoming months at 90 taels per month, with an evenness of 76% to 85% and prices ranging from 430 taels to 550 taels.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Autumn Silkworm Seed Sales are Booming</h3>
<p>Farmers in various cities and towns in Hangzhou have been very disheartened about the silkworm industry in recent years due to repeated failures in silkworm rearing. Now, the heads of the Industry and Construction Bureaus have dispatched personnel to work with the county magistrates to supervise the town and district chiefs in each township to provide practical guidance and disinfection. The silkworm farmers are very moved. They are now dividing up to order autumn seeds from Hangzhou Heng and other seed production farms to prepare for rearing. For a time, autumn silkworm seed sales in the countryside were quite prosperous, and this year's autumn silkworm production will definitely increase.</p>
<h3>Luzhuang Zhenmei Tea Sales are Brisk and Prices are Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market in this port, merchants such as Yangzhuang, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tongfu were actively searching for Zhenmei green tea from Wudong, Tunxi, Shexian, Suian, Kaihua, and other places, and the market was quite active. High-grade goods from Gaoshang in Wuyuan East Road have already rebounded to 110 taels, which is five or six taels higher than before. Other items such as Zhenmei, Xiumei, and Pearl Tea are also selling well. Only the Zhenmei and Gongxi green tea from Wubei have not made significant progress in the market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Zhang Diaoqing Opens Up Two Qian</h3>
<p>Transactions in Coarse Sand and White Sugar Become More Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading market of the Sugar Market Association was quite active. The transaction price of 24th grade coarse sand white sugar of Dutch sugar was 14 taels, 6 qian, 5 fen, slightly higher at 14 taels, 7 qian, and 14 taels, 7 qian, 5 fen for those not yet taxed. Oil bag goods were 14 taels, 2 qian, 5 fen. Sales are quite strong, and the market is still bullish. 14th grade raw sand white sugar was 12 taels, 7 qian, bowl Qing was 9 taels, 2 qian, and Dongwu Qing was 9 taels, 4 qian, 5 fen. The trend is also firm. Taikoo sugar CW mark was 15 taels, 9 qian, HX mark was 15 taels, 3 qian, HM mark was 14 taels, 8 qian, and PX mark was 11 taels, 3 qian, 5 fen. There was little rise or fall compared to before, but the market was stable. There was a Huaxin sign on the sign board selling 500 bags of raw sand red sugar, priced at 12 taels and 7 qian. Zhenji Factory sold more than 100 bags of Binghua Qing, with the price rising to 13 taels. Deda and Dalai No. 2 sold more than 500 bags of Zhang Diao Qing, priced at 11 taels and 4 qian, which was 2 qian higher than the previous session, and the market was also exceptionally bullish.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Water-Stained Tinplate Sold at Auction Yesterday for Over Seven Taels</h3>
<p>Since the Texaco Oil Company's dock was sunk by a British ship last month, all the three thousand and hundreds of boxes of tinplate on the dock (its size is 14.25 inches wide and 18.75 inches long, and 15.25 inches wide and 20.25 inches long) have sunk to the bottom of the Huangpu River. Although attempts were made to salvage them, only more than 3,200 boxes were salvaged. Therefore, yesterday at the China Merchants Bureau North Open-air Auction, the lowest price was 6 taels and 7 qian, and the highest price was 8 taels and 1 qian, and the average price of the auctioned goods was in the range of 7 taels and 1 qian to 2 qian. However, because these goods have been at the bottom of the river for too long, all the goods have been immersed in water stains, so only this kind of market price was opened. However, good goods (90 pounds and 100 pounds), after this auction, sales will inevitably be slightly affected. Because many factories that previously purchased genuine goods now auction these goods, the actual use will inevitably be reduced.</p>
<h3>British Steel Plate Prices Fall as Before</h3>
<p>Recently, various hardware goods have been raised in price one after another. Therefore, British and American plain white iron, corrugated iron, new lead wire, tinplate, etc. all have a tendency to rise in the morning and become more expensive in the evening. Only British steel plate business remains the same, with few actual transactions, and the market is mostly downstream. Currently, 2.5 li is estimated at 8 taels, 5 li is 5 taels and 5 qian, 7.5 li is 5 taels and 2 qian and a half, and 1 fen is 4 taels and 9 qian. If a large number of transactions are made, the market can still be cheaper.</p>
<h3>American White Iron Arrivals Are Prosperous but Sales are Weak</h3>
<p>Regarding spot American white iron, a total of more than 3,600 bundles arrived in the past two days. Therefore, various firms in the market have no fear of shortages. However, customer sales are very rare, and the construction gangs' tinplate workshops also have little demand. Therefore, not much is being sold on the market. As for the market price, there is a strong outside but weak inside atmosphere. Currently, No. 31 can be estimated at 15 taels, 2 qian and a half per dan, No. 28 at 15 taels and 5 qian, No. 26 at 14 taels and 5 qian, No. 24 at 14 taels, and No. 22 at 14 taels, 2 qian and a half. However, the actual openings are all secretly discounted, according to those familiar with the situation. If the tight monetary situation eases and the Yangtze River gangs have a large number of transactions, the future of the market may turn around.</p>
<h3>New Lead Wire Sales Still Strong</h3>
<p>Recently, new lead wire sales have been strong due to strong sales from the Yangtze River gangs and gangs in Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai and other places. The market is quite active and the market is very bullish. No. 16 to No. 20 is estimated at 13 taels per dan, and No. 21 to No. 25 is estimated at 18 taels. Although yesterday was a Sunday, there were still 200 to 300 dan of transactions.</p>

<h3>The Wealthy Man of Bolivia</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Tiny Bolivia, whose standing army is less than 4,000 people, in preparation for foreign war, has a generous capitalist among its people, Mr. Badiño, who donated 15 military aircraft and millions of pounds in cash to provide for the government's war expenses. This latest foreign news, when seen by the big capitalists of our Great China, makes them feel ashamed?</p>
<p>When the big capitalists see it, they may not feel ashamed. Perhaps, they will laugh at Mr. Ba, the big wealthy man of this small country, for taking the country too seriously and money too lightly. With such a huge sum of money, shouldn't it be deposited in a foreign bank? If South American banks are unreliable, it can be deposited in North America; if North American banks are unreliable, it can be deposited in Europe. With money, one can be a rich man everywhere, so why be so attached to Bolivia? Badiño, I don't think you're a clever man, you're a foreign fool.</p>
<p>This is not a harsh remark. Facts tell me that during the January 28th Incident this year, only many small capitalists and non-capitalists were enthusiastic and excited about donating to our loyal and brave 19th Route Army and 5th Army! Their financial resources are limited, and the things they donate are only military rice, pickled vegetables, cigarettes, silk cotton vests, and small amounts of cash donations pieced together. If we were to find a generous capitalist who would take out 15 aircraft and millions of pounds in cash to assist the military, do we have such a person in our Great China? I don't need to answer. Mencius has already said: "If you don't have it, then you don't have it."</p>
<p>Why don't we have it? The legal advisor of the big capitalist told me: "Our boss certainly has the financial resources to donate a few aircraft; but after the donation, I'm afraid it will fuel the civil war and lead to the tragedy of the sinking of the Flying Eagle warship, so we have to refuse to pull out even a hair; for the wealthy men of other countries, destroying their homes to relieve the country's difficulties is patriotism; for our wealthy men, not pulling out even a hair is also patriotism."</p>
<p>Ah! So that's how it is, my apologies.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Words of Division Commander Wang Jingjiu</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>The heroic and magnificent battle of resistance against Japan by the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army this time has not only illuminated history, but has also been deeply engraved in the minds of patriotic people. What I am recording now is based on the oral account of Wang Jingjiu, a former comrade and Division Commander of the 87th Division of the 5th Army. Although it's just a few details, it's a glimpse of reliable history, enough to reveal the secret behind the Japanese's concealment of casualties, and to make people hear it with divine satisfaction.</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, Mr. Wang came to Suzhou to review the troops stationed in Suzhou. He first called me by telephone, and I visited him at his hotel. After five years of separation, we shook hands and exchanged greetings. I was immensely gratified. Mr. Wang's spirit was radiant, and he was still as heroic as before. During the Shanghai battle, Mr. Wang led the 87th Division in combat, with the division headquarters stationed in Liuhang. He fought bravely and annihilated the enemy, always leading the charge in every battle. I asked him about the course of the resistance against Japan. Mr. Wang said that what was most gratifying about this battle was the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers and the common hatred of the people. Every time they faced the enemy, the soldiers' blood boiled, and they charged forward, regardless of their own safety. This kind of spirit was unprecedented in previous wars. I thought that if this spirit could fill the hearts of every soldier in the country, then the small islanders would not be enough to conquer.</p>
<p>I also asked how many enemy casualties there were. Because according to the Japanese military headquarters, only four or five hundred were killed and no more than three thousand were wounded. Although I knew it was false, I couldn't help but feel discouraged when I heard it. Mr. Wang smiled and said, "This is probably the Japanese deceiving themselves and others. In the thirty-three days of fierce battle, the enemy's casualties were numerous, at least more than 10,000. I remember one time, the enemy took advantage of the fact that our barbed wire had not yet been fully deployed, and suddenly charged with a large force. Our army waited for them to go deep and also led the team to attack. The enemy heard the shouts of killing and everyone lost their courage. The whole team collapsed and retreated. However, when they charged in, they entered through the gaps between the barbed wire that had not been deployed. When they retreated in panic, they could not calmly find a gap to exit. Therefore, the entire team of three or four hundred soldiers was almost completely buried under the gunfire of our army. So what they said about only four hundred deaths is too ridiculous." (When I heard this, I felt divinely satisfied.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's troops are now stationed in the capital, stepping up training to become elite troops in preparation for defending the country and resisting the enemy. In addition to classroom knowledge, soldiers also have five hours of technical training every day. Even in the heat, Mr. Wang, although he is a division commander and holds the tiger tally, still personally plans and supervises the training. He personally supervises the exercises every day, working all day long, with almost no moment of rest. He once said that at this time of national crisis, those who are in military service really can't bear to be lazy and comfortable. His words are enough to awaken deep thoughts in the general military. Mr. Wang is young, genuine, simple, humble and harmonious, with the demeanor of a Confucian general. When I went to visit him, Mao Naigong, the director of the Suzhou City Public Security Bureau, was holding a banquet at his residence. There were several military officers and German advisors in attendance. Regiment Adjutant Fu asked eagerly for advice on tactics. Therefore, the topics discussed were all related to tactics. Mr. Mao also participated in the discussion and responded fluently. At first, I was quite surprised that Mr. Mao, as an administrative official, also knew military knowledge like a treasure. Later, I learned that he was an old colleague of Mr. Wang. He had previously served as the Chief of Staff of the Second Army, so he was also a military expert. Later, Regiment Adjutant Fu, the leader of the garrison, repeatedly asked to send guards. Mr. Wang strongly refused. Mr. Mao smiled and said, "Division Commander Wang is a civilian division commander. He doesn't need this at all." This spirit is also commendable.</p>
<h3>Slanderous Names of Melons and Plums</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"Floating sweet melons in clear springs, sinking red plums in cold water." The brilliant words of Cao's son have been passed down for thousands of years. Melons and plums are both fine fruits of summer, which can relieve heat and dryness. However, melons and plums both have slanderous names. Melons are called "Little Maid," and plums are called "Madam." Ancient books do not record this, so it is necessary to describe it.</p>
<p>"Little Maid Melon" is a type of cantaloupe. Its color is white and its texture is tender, resembling a young girl's jade skin. When it is cut open, the pulp is fine and the juice is as sweet as maltose. My friend, Mr. Xu Zhuodai, cultivated in Jiangwan, and planted a field of Little Maid Melons. In summer, when the melons ripened, Mr. Xu personally picked them to give to his relatives and friends. I have also tasted them, and they are truly different from ordinary melons. This year, the Japanese invaded, and the garden was burned to the ground. The fine variety of Little Maid Melon no longer exists. Alas.</p>
<p>Currently, the various members of the Yihai Huilan Society, carrying more than a thousand pieces, are going to Hangzhou to exhibit. They are borrowing the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains to open a grand gathering of calligraphy and painting. Their spirits are flying high and their heroic feelings are surging, and there are many good stories. The members of the Society of Jiang Huilan have written about it. When the long train passed Jiaxing, there was a basket of fruits. The fruits were crimson and round. Ji Qun spent a gold coin to buy sixty or seventy of them, saying, "How cheap are the Zhuli plums!" He then divided them among the members of the society and enjoyed them. Shi, a man from He, knew the produce of He, and said, "Zhuli plums cost only two or three gold coins each. These are not Zhuli plums, but Madam Plums." The members of the society all said, "How scandalous is this name! How scandalous is this name!" Ma Wanli urgently asked Shi about the roots and stems of Madam Plums, and how the branches and leaves were, intending to adjust the colors and paints to make a painting. When the Madam Plum picture is completed, I hope Wanli will show it to us for appreciation. In the past, people quenched their thirst by looking at plums. Today, people might as well relieve their talent by looking at plums. Just a joke.</p>
<h3>Records of What I Saw and Heard in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>▲A Tuft of Hair</p>
<p>The petty people of the old capital have not completely shed the vain concepts of the old era. In the past, wedding ceremonies in the capital were relatively simple. The customs of the banner people still retained the ancient meaning. Most of the extravagant ones would display dozens of pairs of "double happiness" lanterns at the wedding. However, they were neat and pleasing. However, funeral ceremonies were particularly complicated and cumbersome. According to custom, a coffin carried by sixty-four bearers was the most grand, meaning that the coffin was carried by sixty-four people. The number of bearers would be reduced in order, down to eight people. The poles were lacquered in vermillion and were extremely large. Whenever there was a funeral, they would be exposed on the streets, called "airing the poles." According to the ritual system of the imperial court, the coffin cover could be decorated with colored paintings. In recent years, it has been decorated with elaborate embroidery without any basis, simply to please the eyes of the common people. However, the canopies and golden tassels, flowing in all directions, still have the meaning of dragons and phoenixes. Those who work in this profession are called pole houses. Pole houses often boast of the smoothness of carrying the coffin. It is said that those who practice this must place a basin of water on the coffin and be able to raise and lower it without spilling. Because there are many bearers, although the human body moves, the coffin itself is stable, which is indeed commendable. The leader walks in front, assessing the terrain, height, and width, and measuring his steps with a ruler. He must be detailed and cautious, which is beyond the reach of other places. The funeral procession can extend for several miles. In addition to the ceremonial guards prescribed by the ritual system, the common people add to them at will. Recently, many people hold white paper willow branches, called "snow willows," which has never been heard of in ancient times. The procession is very sparse, so it feels even longer. It also moves on the left and right sides, so although it is long, it does not obstruct the vehicles and horses in the road. However, these are all customs of the Han people. The funeral ceremonies of the Manchus have a different form. The coffin is pointed at the head and the sides are shaved, resembling a jade tablet in shape. It seems that its shape is more beautiful than the coffins of the Han people. Before the coffins of the imperial family princes, a sable head is hung as a badge, which still has the remnants of the northern desert customs. The ceremonial guards are also not as elaborate as those of the Han people. Northern customs require scattering paper money at funerals. The paper is cut into the shape of money, folded, and held, and scattered in the air, fluttering down, which is quite colorful to look at. There are professionals who do this. The person has a tuft of hair on the side of his chin, which is used as a sign. The person can scatter it very high, boasting of it as a divine skill. Therefore, wealthy families, wanting to show off the common customs, must hire this person. As a result, his reputation became higher and higher. If the bereaved family cannot get this person, they even consider it a matter of regret. Alas, the exaggeration and ignorance of the northern customs are truly beyond reach. Paper money is already not ancient. This saying was first heard in the middle of the Tang Dynasty. However, it is still burned to provide for the afterlife. If it is scattered along the road like flowers, to gain the laughter of the children of the common people, what is it for? In recent years, the ignorant common people have specialized in exaggerating their wealth to stir up the city people. This is true in both the north and the south. Tracing the reason, it is because there is a saying that funerals should not be held after the Kaiyuan Ritual, and there is no clear system for major funerals, so people can arbitrarily spread out, leading to a loss of norms. During the reign of Emperor Xuantong, the funeral of Empress Dowager Cixi was incredibly extravagant, with many things not in accordance with ancient customs. Evil customs have been followed for a long time. Wedding ceremonies have a fixed system, which cannot be exceeded. During the wedding ceremony of the abdicated emperor in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the ancient system was preserved. The costumes and guards were concrete and subtle. The night guards transmitted warnings, and the wind sent the banners, corresponding to the slow sound of horses' hooves. It was truly like reading a picture.</p>
<h3>Record of Striking the Bell at the Ancient Temple (69)</h3>
<p>— Tingcao Zhai Fu</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>My argument these days has become more and more radical. Mr. Zhu suddenly asked me: (If you were to take control of education for a province or the entire country, how would you plan to do it?) I answered without hesitation: (Stop running schools and set up factories! (Mr. Zhu asked: (Why not run workshops? The word "factory" is scary!) I said: (What I want to run is, of course, a workshop, but I want to emphasize the production aspect of "work" to correct the traditional "consumption" aspect of "study." I have heard in the city that for decades, agricultural schools, industrial schools, vocational schools, and professional schools have almost completely failed. Although there are many reasons for their failure, the main one is this "school" signboard. With the school signboard hanging up, those teachers and students who can only talk but cannot work can get away with it. They use the school signboard as a shield to temporarily evade the attacks of the times. They deceive society by saying: (We are promoting production education. But don't be impatient. You can't grab an old hen and immediately tell it to lay an egg. In a few years, or even decades, I will naturally lay big eggs, you see.) Now we already know that this old hen can only poop and can't lay eggs. I don't want bookworms to hide behind the shield of the workshop and be bookworms anymore, so I bluntly changed all the schools into factories. Mr. Zhu said; (Your method is extremely straightforward! But you need to be careful, although bookworms can't work or farm, they can give speeches, publish in newspapers, write articles, submit petitions, and issue declarations. Your fate will be to be ousted under the accusation of destroying education. As a result, your factory will not be able to be established, and they will continue to run their schools until the country is destroyed. They are not afraid of the destruction of the country, because the colony also needs teachers and students who do not engage in production to be used as anesthetizing tools. There is another thing you need to be careful about. You only know that there are bookworms in schools, but you don't know that there are money-worshipping bugs in factories. As long as you put up the factory signboard, these money-worshipping bugs will swarm in. Here, everyone only cares about making money. Here, gold is more valuable than everything else, even more valuable than human life! So even if you can run the factory, it will not be the factory in your mind. Generally, those who run schools hold books and forget about life; generally, those who run factories hold gold and forget about life; generally, those who are social activists hold slogans and forget about life. From changing from this to that, from that to this, if you neglect the major premise of life, you will be disappointed. Our workshop only takes life as the major premise. In our mind, life is above everything else. Because we want to cultivate a rational life, we oppose schools, factories, and all organizations that neglect life, and we want to create a workshop full of life meaning. You changed the school into a factory to replace one organization lacking life meaning with another organization lacking life meaning. The result is driving away a pack of wolves and bringing a pack of tigers. I don't want to pour cold water on your passionate spark. Perhaps your opinion contains a part of the truth: if you want to break the deep-rooted habits, it is inevitable to use some overcorrection methods. But never forget that (cultivating a rational life) is our true purpose.)</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Kong Lufu told me. An old woman mistook the Central Party Headquarters for a pawnshop. It's quite funny. Record it to amuse the readers. One day. Next to Dingjia Bridge. Came an old woman with unsteady steps. Holding a large bundle. Asked the police where the pawnshop was. The police thought it was the Party Headquarters. Responded casually, "To the left." The woman indeed went left. When she arrived at the gate of the Party Headquarters. Did not dare to enter immediately. When she saw people coming out. All held packages in their hands. (Official business and packages) Coming and going frequently. The woman thought to herself. "The pawnshop is here." Holding the bundle, she went straight in. The guard stopped her, saying. "What do you want?" The woman showed him the bundle. Saying. "I'm here to pawn something." The guard laughed, saying. "That's all. This is the Party Headquarters. Not a pawnshop." The woman angrily said. "You said it was a pawnshop (homophone). And now you say it's not a pawnshop. What does this mean?" Still insisted on entering. After repeated explanations. The old woman seemed to understand. And left east.</p>

<h3>Three Photos of Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Photos are something that can't be discussed, especially photos of students studying abroad, which are even less discussable, but my view is not like this.</p>
<p>The first photo of a student studying abroad is when he is about to go abroad, he must publish a photo, such as Mr. So-and-so graduated from So-and-so University, with excellent grades, and now plans to study abroad in So-and-so country, and will set sail on So-and-so day, etc., a photo. The second photo of a student studying abroad is when Mr. So-and-so is studying at So-and-so University in So-and-so country, and has now graduated, with excellent learning, and is deeply appreciated by the principal, and will take a ship back to China on So-and-so day, and will use what he has learned to contribute to the motherland, and our country has gained another outstanding political talent, etc., and another photo comes.</p>
<p>The third photo of a student studying abroad is when Mr. So-and-so is studying in So-and-so country, studying So-and-so subject, and has gained a lot of experience, and will probably graduate next summer vacation, and will contribute to the motherland infinitely when he returns to the country after completing his studies, etc., and another photo also comes. I think it's fine to study hard, and it's fine to return to the country, but why must you publish one, two, three photos? It doesn't matter if you lose a little news status by publicizing it in the newspaper. I'm not being harsh, but these photos are completely a manifestation of vanity. It seems that going abroad to study is regarded as an incredible thing, an amazing masterpiece. This kind of thinking is deeply contemptible. No wonder Chinese people see foreigners and regard them as gods, prostrating themselves completely. Just being a student studying abroad for a few years has already become an incredible person. Isn't it even more incredible for the genuine foreign products who grew up abroad?</p>
<p>Moreover, the few gentlemen studying abroad, I examined their titles, are either Doctors of Law or Doctors of Political Economy, and it is very rare to want to study practical subjects such as crafts and commerce. May I ask, what are politics and economics? To put it bluntly, aren't they euphemisms for (getting promoted and making a fortune)? Studying politics means wanting to be an official, and studying economics means wanting to make a fortune. Isn't this a manifestation of getting promoted and making a fortune?</p>
<p>Let me talk about photos again. Nowadays, photos that show off are very popular. One is movie stars, the other is singers and dancers, and the third is lawyers who have just hung up their signs and protect human rights. They all want to publish a photo to show off and attract business. May I ask, what is the purpose of the three photos of students studying abroad?</p>
<p>I think the more doctors like this in China, the more hopeless China will be.</p>

<h3>Machine Oil</h3>
<p>— Zuo</p>
<p>Before 50 years ago, all machine oils were made from animal fat or vegetable matter. Such as beef and mutton tallow, whale brain oil, dolphin oil, castor oil, palm oil, etc., all had wide uses. Only whale oil is easy to dry, and is rarely used now. But dolphin oil is still used in small watches, beef and mutton tallow is still used in certain engines, and castor oil is used in huge turbines. But these are all exceptions. Now, lubricating oils made from petroleum have virtually replaced all other lubricating oils. The reason is that animal and vegetable oils are good at absorbing oxygen in the air, and thus become corrupt and thick, and turn into acidic substances that are harmful to metals. Mineral petroleum lubricating oils have no such drawbacks.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of machine oils, each for a specific purpose, and there is no one kind that can suit all purposes. A drop of airplane oil, used in a watch, can make it stop. Conversely, watch oil added to an airplane motor will lose its effectiveness. There are as many as twelve kinds of lubricants used in automobiles alone.</p>
<p>Machine oil does not wear out, it only loses its lubricating effect by absorbing moisture, dust, and oxygen. After machine oil absorbs oxygen, it forms a kind of compound, which is temporarily dissolved in the oil, but when it encounters a cold surface, it analyzes into a hard substance, which is very detrimental to the operation of the axle.</p>
<p>A good machine oil must have the following conditions: (1) Rich in viscosity, enough to isolate the metal surface; (2) Rich in fluidity, able to penetrate all the gaps in the axle; (3) Must have cohesion, not only can it stick to the metal surface, but also can form a thin film and maintain it for a long time; (4) Can dissipate heat, making the bearing often cold; (5) Not easy to dry, nor will it thicken; (6) Absolutely no acidity exists, so as not to corrode the metal. Machine oil made from petroleum is closest to all these conditions. But experimentalists are still diligently studying to seek perfection.</p>

<h3>How to Eliminate Superstition: The Precondition for Discussion Groups to Abolish Superstition</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hao</p>
<p>Speaking of the futility of praying to gods and worshiping Buddha, not only does it waste useful money, but it also delays important matters, which is greatly related to people's livelihood. Originally, the prevalence of infectious diseases is the result of uncleanliness and lack of hygiene, but the general superstitious people say that the plague god has descended, and that sacrifices must be made to save the ghosts and gods in order to avoid this disaster. They do not pay attention to epidemic prevention and hygiene, and therefore do not know how many lives have been mistakenly sent. The general women in our country are not willing to take out money for other things, but they are very willing to be generous for all the expenses of worshiping gods and worshiping Buddha. Some, although their families are not economically well-off, are very frugal, but they must raise the money for incense and candles in the midst of difficulties, thinking that the Bodhisattva can protect them in the future to make a fortune. If we can count this huge waste of the whole people, it must be very considerable. If we can use this money to run public undertakings, it must also be very impressive.</p>
<p>Superstition is so important, so we must think of ways to break it. How can we break it? Now I will write my humble opinion below:</p>
<p>(1) Convert the temples in various places into public undertakings, or run public schools, and burn all idols. If people have superstitious acts of welcoming gods and holding festivals, the local authorities should intervene and prohibit them.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to propaganda and instill common sense. Those who have been influenced by this and have a slightly clearer mind may be able to break through the coma and no longer be superstitious.</p>
<p>(3) To fundamentally eradicate superstitious ideas, we must also pay attention to children. Because in our country's old families, the elders often order children to respect ghosts and gods. With this bad lesson, children will naturally be infected. I hope that the teachers of primary schools will pay attention to the issue of (superstition) and correct the students at any time.</p>
<p>I think the problem of (superstition) is really very important in our country. I hope everyone will put some effort into discussing it and come up with some good ways to (break) it.</p>
<h3>The Only Shortcut</h3>
<p>— Yu·Hong·　·</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>Also a Bread Problem</h3>
<p>— A·Yang·</p>
<p>An Inharmonious Tune</p>
<p>The weather is really too hot, after waking up from a nap, I can't do anything. I reached into my pants pocket and摸ed my park pass, and then walked towards the French Park in my broken leather shoes.</p>
<p>It was probably already past three o'clock at that time. Many of the benches in the park had already been occupied by people who had come earlier, but the stiff benches under the roots of the trees were resting there one by one. Therefore, I chose a relatively shady place to sit down.</p>
<p>Usually, whenever I go to the park, I always bring a book or a newspaper, but today I forgot about it. Sitting alone on a stiff bench is really boring. Although there were many men and women around me, they were all strangers. I didn't know them, just as they didn't know me, and, I hated them! Although the sounds of songs and laughter were also vibrating in my ears, however, this was the music I didn't want to hear!</p>
<p>So I leaned my shoulders against the tree behind me, closed my eyes, and planned to take a nap, but how could I sleep in this noisy surrounding! When a heavy footstep passed in front of me, I straightened my body and opened my eyes. At this time, I discovered that a foreign girl had also come to sit alone on the stiff bench opposite me.</p>
<p>I don't know if she was English, French, or from another country. She was about twenty years old. She was wearing a plain white dress, a lake-blue short skirt, no socks, and a pair of scarlet feet were tightly stuffed inside her shoes. The dress didn't have sleeves, and her delicate arms were also exposed, setting off the elegant dress, making her even more adorable. Moreover, when she occasionally twisted, her plump breasts jumped under the soft, thin bodice. This jump seemed to be able to弾every man's heart. Her nose wasn't very high, and her eyes were black, not like the terrible gray-blue of other people.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but as soon as I saw her, I felt a full sense of pleasure. I felt that she was simply a work of art. So I often偷看ed her, and she often looked at me too, but, when our eyes met, I lowered my head unconsciously, as if blood and fire were burning on my cheeks. I also felt as scared as if a thief had been discovered by the owner. And she seemed to be smiling at me, which, in my opinion, was simply a greater punishment.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I couldn't help but抬ed my head to偷看 her again. Ah, it's really strange, at this time, an Annamite teenager was sitting next to her. He was very short, wearing a white cotton suit, and also wearing a white Panama hat. Under the衬托 of this white clothing, his face, which was already very dark, looked particularly ugly. He was sitting on her right side, his face facing left, his mouth pouting, as if he was telling her something or discussing something, but she didn't say a word, but turned around to look at him again, neither paying attention to him nor rejecting him.</p>
<p>So I began to doubt. I thought, maybe she's a business経吧. At that time, I associated it with the scene described by Jiang Jiao慈 in his "Lisha's Lament" about a Russian prostitute Lisha soliciting business in Hongkou Park. So I paid more attention to her, and finally I was sure that she was a person with the same fate as Lisha.</p>
<p>Probably because the Annamite teenager was too ugly, she often smiled at me and sent autumn waves to me. The Annamite teenager was also looking at me with jealous eyes. I was afraid that this would disrupt their business and ruin my enjoyment, so I stood up and walked to a place farther away from them and sat down again. There, I could carefully spy on them, but they couldn't see me, because my position was just behind them.</p>
<p>The man was still pouting his lips, and she was still silent as before, but often looked back at him.</p>
<p>Finally, she walked away. A few seconds later, he also chased after her. When the two of them passed through a row of low trees and reappeared in my eyes, they were already a good couple holding hands.</p>
<p>One is tall, one is short, one is black, one is white - ah, what an inharmonious tune - thinking of this, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>When I was just about to leave, I met them again. At this time, the two of them were standing in front of a snack shop, surrounded by a rattan chair, drinking ice. When she saw me, she showed a very embarrassed look, which made me very uneasy. On the way back, I still couldn't find a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>Want to Ride in a Sedan Chair</p>
<h3>Brother Gong's Good News</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Brother Gong, who is nearing the age of thirty, really must have a wife. Recently, he has really been actively pursuing this, and he already has a suitable partner, which we should celebrate for him. Today, I met him again, so of course my first sentence should be to ask about his marriage.</p>
<p>(Brother! Congratulations, congratulations! I heard that you have already found your sister-in-law. I wonder when we will get to eat wedding wine)?</p>
<p>(Thank you! Thank you! But, ... but ... this won't work, it won't work). This was his reply. He always shook his head when he spoke, and he wasn't very good at using words either. For example, he repeated things that shouldn't be repeated. Although he himself was definitely saying it with great effort, the listeners became confused instead. Afterwards, I listened carefully to his report of the recent events. I didn't disturb him at all, I let him fully explain everything he wanted to say.</p>
<p>(Yesterday, yesterday evening, I went to see her alone again. In a small alley. Unfortunately, it stinks there. No, she, she's very rotten. The first thing she said was that she wanted me to swear, she didn't believe that I was twenty-nine years old and still didn't have a wife. I really had no way. I said that swearing is not credible, even if I swear (I will not die well), but would I really die? I said, you can investigate it. Afterwards, she said that she wanted to ride in a sedan chair when she got married, and, and ... get married right away. There's really no way. I thought this was out of the question right away. I said, let's be friends first, everyone get to know each other's personalities, but she said it's okay to get married first and then get to know each other's personalities. After you get married, are you still afraid of not understanding your husband's temperament? There's really no way. Then, then I said, suppose ... suppose everyone ... everyone's personalities don't match, then what about divorce? ... She said that divorce is absolutely out of the question. At the same time, she doesn't approve of being friends first; because people who don't know us will think that a big girl is outside ... having an affair. There's really no way. After that, she talked about riding in a sedan chair when she got married. Of course, I don't approve of it. Wouldn't that be wasting money? I advocate being as simple as possible: do you think that's right? But she insisted on riding in a sedan chair. In the end, she still wanted to ride in a sedan chair. There's really no way - ... but I believe she is very good to me, in order to ... in order to see me, she exchanged two out of the three gold buttons she had saved up from working for several years for new clothes, and she always, always praised me in front of others. But ... unfortunately, her mind is too rotten: the woman is very规矩. ... I heard that she has also bought a few acres of land in the countryside with the money she earned from working herself. ... The person is ... but unfortunately she's just too rotten. There's really no way. ... ...) He seemed to have finished speaking, his gaze fixed on my face, as if he were waiting for my reply; however, just as I was preparing to speak, he immediately continued:</p>
<p>(Actually I ... I also because ... because I don't earn much money, if I had money now, then even if we got married right away and rode in a sedan chair, there's nothing I couldn't do).</p>
<p>His words came back to the same point. Of course, I also advised him to compromise a little. Besides, this so-called conflict between the old and the new is a common phenomenon in modern China. Finally, I wished them success soon, because everyone loves to eat wedding wine.</p>
