<h3 id="c1">國人將何以應付今日之危局 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>華</p>
<p>外患與内憂殆有固結不解之因緣。蓋内憂足以召外患。而外患亦足以增加内憂之程度。稽諸史乘。歷歷不爽。不獨中國今日爲然也。中國今日。内憂深。矣。外患亦嚴重極矣。埀危之局。將何以挽救。此誠今日國人當前急切待决之問題也。</p>
<p>自去年九一八以來。國人無日不在憂患之中。泊乎今日。日本更承認僞組織並與締結條約。將使東北永久脫離我版圖。且復乘機窺我熱河。動搖我華北。進而伸張其勢力於我全國。雖在東北。尙有忠勇之義軍。積極奮鬥。日人侵略我之算盤。未必能盡如其意。然我國若徒靜待國聯之動靜。或九國公約簽字國之舉動。而自身莫展一籌。將何以禦日本一步緊一步之侵略乎。</p>
<p>東北之情形。危險萬狀固矣。回顧西南如何據日本報紙所英國援助之下。向雲南靑海雙方進攻。欲將康藏完全收在掌握中而建設唐時代之大西藏。」此雖爲日人故意之宣傳。以期轉移吾人之目光於西南。而便其侵略我東北之進行。然康藏之警。由來巳久。最近靑海各團體復電中央告急。電文中且有以下之沉痛語。「曩者東北之禍急。而西南之禍緩。今則西」</p>
<p>南之禍亦亟。曩以國人不注意東北而東北亡。今如國人仍不注意西南。則西南亦將亡。」是西南亦岌岌可危。中國之邊患。不僅東北巳也。</p>
<p>邊患旣如此其深。反觀中國内部又如何。簡單之答語。即不勝杞憂而巳。以言經濟。農村　於破産。失業者日多一日。而國家之財政。日益竭蹶。秩序治安。亦受影響。以言内政。人民怨政府對外軟弱。無術以却强敵之侵略。而政府則責人民感情用事。不諒政府冷靜平和之對策。紛紛擾擾。徒使外患愈深。内部之問題益多。且内部之問題愈多。更足使列强在華起種種爭光恐後攘利之衢突。嗚呼。寳貴光陰。如此蹉跎。日復一日。來日大難。此種現象之足憂。實亦無可諱言者。</p>
<p>雖然。「其亡其亡。繫於苞桑。」國人誠能因痛感危亡之禍迫於目前。而蠲除對内之成見。以有效之對策對外。協力同心。努力自救。則目前所有種種危急情况。即不失爲解除内憂緩和外患之良藥。「國無敵國外患者國恒亡。」大敵當前。環顧四周。一年以來。果有何國予我以有力之救助國人果能從此覺悟。不作依賴外援之想。速定自力應付之方。則今日以前種種之眞躓。或即他日轉入坦途之起點。而彼敵國。不特不足以亡我。反足以予我起死回生之剌激。假如由今之道。無變今之習。大難臨頭。而猶泄泄沓沓。不知團結。不顧緩急。不肯犧牲小己以救大我。放棄私利以全公益。則後患之來必有不忍言不敢言者。覺悟與努力。惟在今日。莫再蹉跎。莫貽後悔。國人其念之哉。</p>
<p>要電</p>
<p>日本與僞組織訂約之次日</p>
<p>我國提出嚴重抗議</p>
<p>抗議書指出日本應負責任七大端</p>
<p>照會十二國請探取有效應付方法</p>
<p>抗議書全文</p>
<p>外部電達蔣使</p>

<p>「自去年九月十八之夕、日本軍隊按照預定計劃、突然轟擊瀋陽城以後、日本政府着着進行、使東三省之局勢、日趨嚴重、不僅中國主權、受極度之蹂躪、即國際條約神聖之原則、亦爲之根本動搖、世界和平亦遭悲痛之打擊、去年九月三十日、國際聯合會行政院之决議、促令日本政府、不再使局勢愈趨嚴重、并應至其遼吉兩省所佔之地、將軍隊撤至鐡路區域以内、日内政府且亦自己承認此决議、乃行政院决議甫經通過、日本軍隊立即隨之而擴大行動、進佔東北各省土地、包括齊齊哈爾及黑省内之其他重要城邑、十一月間、暴變發於天津、斯則天津日租界人員、實有以引致之、去年十二月十日、國際聯合會行政院、以日本之同意、重申誥誡、不許再行擴大局勢、并决議日本軍隊、應及早撤至鐡路區域以内、日本政府對於此項决議、則報之以侵略更甚之活動、其範圍不僅限於東三省、並波及於離發難地點甚遠之區域·錦州哈爾濱及東省其他軍事要塞、均無不受日本軍隊之炸擊、最後乃至奪據而後已、本年一月終、劇烈之戰事行動、起於上海、日本海軍陸戰隊、實爲戎首、日本竟增派陸軍至數師之衆、以致生命財産損失無算、日本旣以武力掠據東三省之全部、乃從事於傀儡組織之製造、謚之曰滿洲國、而使溥儀爲之主、一切實權則操之於向東京政府負責之官吏之手、至是攫奪我鐡路、截留我關鹽、及其他稅欵、破壞我郵政、屠戮壓迫我人民、恣意毁滅我財産、以及其他一切非法行動、盡以滿洲國之名義行之、實則主之者乃效忠日本政府、或受日本政府所支配之人員、日本在中國每次侵略舉動、中國政府無不向之提出嚴重抗議、喚起其對於自身所負重大責任之注意、無如日本對於此類抗議、非特漠然置之、反報之以侵略更甚之行動、世界各國對於其用暴動擴展疆土之政策、亦曾一再予以警告、本年一月之初、美國政府曾正式宣佈、「美國不能承認任何事實的局面爲合法、凡用違反一九二八年八月二十七日巴黎公約規定與義務之方法而造成之局面、條約或協定、美國均不承認之、」二月十六日、國際聯合會行政院十二代表宣言、「凡蔑視國際聯合會盟約第十條而侵犯會員國土地之完整、及變更其政治之獨立者、其他會員國均不應認爲有效」、三月十一日、國際聯合會大會一致决議、凡用違反國際聯合會盟約、或巴黎公約之方法而造成之局面條約或協定、國際聯合會會員匣負不予承認之義務」、又「中日爭端若在任何一方軍力壓迫之下、覓取解决、實與盟約精神相違背」、日本政府不顧友邦之忠言與警告、不顧國際聯合會之决議與訓誡、不顧人類之公論、現更對於其黷武主義所産生之傀儡組織、悍然加以正式承認、並與之締結所謂條約、俾日本有駐兵東省之權、藉欲淪陷東三省於日本保護國之地位、國際聯合會依照去年十二月十日、行政院通過而經日晒接受並决議所委派之調查團、以日本政府代表之協助、從事工作、今當該調查團工作甫竣、國際聯合會尙未加以討論之際、日本遽行承認僞組織此項舉動、一面適足以增加其罪戾、一面無異對國際聯合會之權威、爲侮辱性之挑戰、殊不如國聯之判斷必依眞理與公平爲歸宿也、日本悍然施行其暴力的殘殺的與征服的政策、其責任之重大、在近代國際關係之歷史上、罕與倫比、茲舉其犖犖大者如下、</p>
<p>（一）日本巳違犯國際公法之基本原則、蓋日本巳破壞中華民國領土之完整、纂奪中國之政治與行政權也、</p>
<p>（二）日本巳違犯法律之初步原則與人道觀念、蓋日本巳殺傷無數中國人命、毁損現時尙難統計之中國公私財産也、</p>
<p>（三）日本巳違犯國際聯合會盟約、蓋在該盟約中、各會員國會擔任尊重並保持所有聯合會各會員國之領土完整、及現有之政治上獨立、以防禦外來之侵犯也、</p>
<p>（四）日本巳違犯非戰公約、蓋在該公約中、各締約國曾鄭重聲明、放棄以戰爭爲彼此間施行國家政策之工具、並互允各國間設有爭諯、不論如何性質、因何發端、祗可用和平方法解决之也、</p>
<p>（五）日本巳違犯民國十一年簽訂之九國條約、蓋在該條約中、各簽約國除中國外、曾互允尊重中國之主權與獨立、以及領土與行政之完整也、</p>
<p>（六）日本巳違犯其自爲之誓約、蓋日本曾聲明在東省無領土企圖、且允於最速期間内、將日軍撤至鐡路區域内也、</p>
<p>（七）日本巳違犯國際聯合會歷次訓誡、蓋國際聯合會曾一再誥誡日本、不得就其因侵略中國而造成之形勢、再使擴大與惡化也、對於日本自去年九月十八日轟擊瀋陽城、至本年九月十五日、承認僞組織所有一切侵略行爲、及其發生之任何結果、中國政府當令日本政府、擔負完全責任、中國政府並保留其在現狀下國際公法與條約上所付與之權利、（十六日專電）</p>

<p>日本於一九三二年九月十五日竟實行承認所謂滿洲國、並公布所謂日滿約定書中、日本有駐兵東省之權、其目的欲淪陷東三省於日本保護國之地位、而所謂滿洲國者、固係日本在中國東三省領土内所製造所主持所支配之傀儡組織也、一年以來、日本所爲種種國際罪惡、連續不巳、不僅刦奪中國之主權、抑且違背最重要之國際條約、包括一九二二年在華盛頓簽訂之九國條約、該約貴國亦爲簽字國之一、（當事國之一）今者日本之承認僞國、無異在其犯罪行爲之索練上、又加一最毒之環、中國政府不得不促醒貴國政府、對於因日本承認滿洲國而引起之嚴重局勢、予以深切之注意、日本如何於九一八之夕開始襲據我東三省如何張其鐡腕、魚肉我三千萬同胞、如何纂刦我政權、藉造僞組織、胥爲舉世同知之事實、無庸贅述、所欲槪括一言者、即自九一八以後日本無日不擴大其暴行、以至於今日、而有此承認傀儡之舉、乃日本猶欲巧言欺世、謂所謂滿洲國者、乃東省人民圖謀分立之結果、殊不知東北傀儡組織、爲日本軍事侵略之産物、轉復用之爲工具、乃無可掩飾之事實、多數日本官吏、受東京政府之命令、發縱指使於舞台之上、眞正東北民衆、則宛轉哀號於日軍鐡蹄之下、苟使日本軍隊一日撤退、則所謂滿洲國之崩潰、可立而待、查九國條約第一條、締約各國除中國餐、應尊重中國之主權獨立、及領土行政之完整、日本製造傀儡、從而承認之、以及其侵略東北之種種行爲、其爲直接侵略中國之主權、嚴重損害中國土地行政之完整、殆無絲毫之疑義、當時九國條約之締結、即爲欲阻止此類事件之發生者也、今日本不僅對於中國肆行侵害、且肆意蔑視世界公論、罔顧其對於其他國家應盡之神聖義務、如日本之行爲不受相當制裁、九國條約當事國坐視該公約之成爲廢紙、其結果誠有不忍言者、其他國際條約是否繼續維持其神聖不可侵犯性、胥視此而定、而日本以武力奪取中國約四十萬方哩之土地、復不顧友邦之勸告、正式承認其在該地一手造成之非法組織、其慘酷結果、不僅限於中國、即世界和平亦受不祥之威嚇也、鑒此上述情形、中國政府認爲嚴重局勢、勢巳發生、涉及九國條約之適用問題、特依據該約第七條之規定、以充分坦白之意見、通知九國條約當事國政府、並請其對於日本自去年九一八轟擊瀋陽城以至於今年九月十五日正式承認滿洲國所有種種之侵略行動、因是而造成之事態、採取正當及有效之應付方法、</p>
<p>日本承認僞組織</p>
<p>外部通知國聯</p>
<p>外部訓條前晚發出</p>
<p>列舉日本侵略暴行</p>
<p>（南京）日本十五日實行承認僞組織後、外部十五日晚、即將訓條電達日内瓦、令我國代表即行致牒國聯、訓條大意如下、（一）自九一八以來、日本繼續施行其暴力的殘殺的征服的政策、其惟一目的、即在擴張領土、種種暴行、日益加厲、至今日乃有正式承認僞組織之舉、日本政府之承認僞組織、實係對歷來在東三省侵略中國領土完整之一切行爲、自劃招供、自承責任、而國聯盟約第十條、固明明規定應尊重并保持所有會員國之領土完整者也、（二）傀儡組織、純爲日人一手製造、一手操縱、所有實權、盡歸日人掌握、由日本承認傀儡、無異自己承認其侵略行爲、（三）日本與僞組織間之所謂議定書、純屬片面性質、僅爲日本國遂其在東三省建設保護團之野心而已、（四）依照日「僞」所訂議定書、日本不啻有擔任僞組織國防之權、今後日本實行此項規定、其對於中國及世界之威脅、至爲嚴重、（五）自中日爭執提交國聯以後、各方俱靜候解决、今調查團報告書、尙未披露、國聯并再三告誡、不各　大局勢、乃日本仍悍然不顧、一意孤行、製造僞組織、而承認之、蔑視國聯之權威、巳達極點、在上述情形之下、應即請求國聯加緊工作、採取最有效之方法、以對付目前之局面、（十六日中央社電）</p>
<p>附錄九國條約第七條全文、</p>
<p>第七條、締約各國協定、無論何時遇有某種情形發生、締約中之任何一團、認爲牽涉本條約規定之適用問題、而該項適用宜付諸討論者、有關係之締約各國應完全坦白互相通知、（十六日專電）</p>

<p>史汀生謂空言無補</p>
<p>（華盛頓）史汀生與國務院其他人員對於日本之承認「滿洲（僞）國」仍抱旁觀不語之態度、講壇報稱、官場一般見解以爲九國公約確爲日本所破壞、但華盛頓在日内瓦未有舉動時、對於「滿洲（僞）國」僅採行在外交上置諸不理之辦法、衆信國務院表同情於中國所稱「滿洲國」案件在胡佛主義之範圍内一說、但希望李頓報告書可爲對日談判以理直此事之根據、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國務卿史汀生今日接見新聞記者時、不允評論日本承認滿洲僞組織事、謂此時空言無補、所有切實行動、將會同其他有關係各國作最後决定、即對於巴黎所傳九國公約簽字國將開會取决日本是否違約之說、史氏亦不允加以徵實、僅鄭重聲稱、目下各事皆待國聯調查團報告發表再說、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>各國報紙</p>
<p>評承認僞國事法</p>
<p>（巴黎）法政府尙未接到日本承認「滿洲國」及中國對日抗議之正式通知、法國不欲有單獨行動、但願與英美及國聯密切接觸、必須認識李頓報告書後、始可表示意見、法報大都緘默態度、與官塲同、惟巴黎時報則對此最近發展、稍發議論、逆料遠東將發生令人不適之意外事件、並謂有關係方面苟稍知禮貌、則當靜待李頓報告書、及國聯對此報告書之决議而後行動云、巴黎時報希望日本不退出國聯、因此舉僅使此難題由國聯而轉移於九國公約之簽字國耳、此乃人人所願避免、尙望東京對於何爲保障合法利益所可許者、及何爲國際合作與尊嚴公約範圍内權利所禁止者、熟思而考慮之云、（十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）法報批評日本承認「滿洲國」之行爲措詞頗爲審愼持重、一般輿情以爲此舉殊不合理、巴黎日報謂日本縱在東三省有無可疑問之利益、但亦不許作此無益於遠東時局之姿勢云、又勢工報評論謂日本之承認「滿洲國」、乃對美對俄之直接危害、且係破壞九國公約之舉、恐將引起嚴重後果云、民報稱、日滿協定書之條欵直同軍事兼併之行爲云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>英（倫敦）孟却斯德指導報稱、日本遁詞、姑不具論、日本之承認「滿州國」、簡直撕碎中國肢體、而出之以强暴、此種强暴雖爲戰爭、然日本不謂爲戰爭也、日本至是已破壞中日兩國所簽定之條約、日本如此行爲、」乃全體國際秩序之打擊、歐戰以還、吾人固無日不欲在西方及東方維持此秩序也云（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報社論謂日本承認「滿洲國」、目下他國政府似不致效尤、日人在東三省之各種利益、已因日「滿」議定書而轉穩固、日本用歐戰前之政治手腕而獲此結果、第其反抗國聯約章凱洛格非戰公約與其他日本所簽字各約之原則、已無庸諱言矣、該報又評論日本聲明書中所言開放滿洲國内地、以容納外人一節、謂英人輿情對於此言之感想、猶不若因英人在牛莊被擄而起的感想之深切英人之不願入内地者、猶被匪擄、旅行於鐡路者、猶時遭危害、則轉不若禁止旅行之爲愈、日本之進行對滿政策、確然不稍顧及其義務、此早爲美國務卿史汀生與國聯决議案所抨擊、但在李頓報告書暴露各種事實之前、而欲辱及日本、將爲錯着、曩者日本在滬所行種種、大不列顚罕有贊助之者、但滿洲日人之地位、與上海迥然不同、未可一槪而論也云云、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>德（柏林）日本之正式承認「滿洲國」因宣傳已久、早在人意料中、故未引起多大之訝異、此間官塲稱、德國在遠東之政治上利益、並無危險、就商務關係言、日本屢以門戶開放爲言、今駐遠東之德政府代表、尙未有日本巳變其觀念之報告云、德國報紙頗重視日滿簽約及中國抗議事、但對此新發展、多不置評、僅保皇派報紙克魯士報稱、中日關係恐將愈形緊張、而再釀成不宣而戰之局勢、希望俄美兩國乘此機會、放棄其漠視之態度云、（十五日路爱電）</p>

<p>出席第十屆世界運動會之我國選手團、沈嗣良（總代表宋君復（敎練）劉長春（選手）於昨日上午八時半乘柯立芝總統輪到滬、在新關碼頭登岸、到埠歡迎者有各人親友、及體育界新聞界等、沈君因行李較多、檢騐費時、至十一時許、始離埠赴約翰大學、宋劉兩君於九時半卽趨車赴八仙橋靑件會下榻、今晨九時半乘京滬車轉赴北平、同船來滬者、尙有西靑體育主任托平君、茲將詳情錄下、</p>
<p>沈君談話</p>
<p>到處歡迎　余等在美、除華橋表示熱烈歡迎外、美國人民對於余等、亦處處均表示好感、並不以勝負爲懷、上海西人靑年會托平君、每日與余等周旋、聯絡感情、故我國此次參加大會、雖人少無成績可言、確得國際間民族之奸感、及極佳之印象、</p>
<p>赴會經過　余等於七月八日離滬、參加十屆世界運動大會、當於二十九日深晚到達洛山磯、當抵碼頭時、數十僑胞鵠立歡迎、驟增余等無限快樂、次日卽赴會行開會禮、大會第二日、劉長春君卽開始與賽、雖未奪得錦標而返、惟劉君之奮　精神、亦堪欽佩、而所歴經騐實多、故僅須能將個人經騐、貢獻提倡、作精密之討論、以備他日再度參與、深信此後倘能政民合作、對此有澈底之認識、極力提倡、以最後之决心、爲不斷之進行、力求普及、則不難於四年後、與歐美相較也、</p>
<p>大會結果　大會於八月十四日閉幕、美國第一、獲錦標四十一個、第二意大利、第三法國、第四瑞典、余等遂於二十一日啟程、今日始能與滬上同胞相見、氏又謂所有赴美沿途經過情形、巳迭誌報載、當回滬時、沿途並無特殊見聞、</p>
<p>心怵目　輪抵神戶、余等亦未登陸、據云日本在未承認僞滿洲國之前、連日迭有慶祝舉動、街頭巷尾、滿目標語宣傳、各游藝場所等、均已懸牌日九一八國慶紀念日、免費入座字樣云、</p>
<p>劉君談話</p>
<p>甚覺抱歉　記者於下午三時赴靑年會訪劉長春君、茲錄其談話如下、余（劉自稱以下此仿）此次赴美參加第十屆世界運動會、摩前以並無凖備、致毫無成績、　國慚愧萬分、甚望國人予以原諒、問時並望努力提　、準備下屆一九三六年之大會、至余之此次參加、並非政府遣派、所有此行川費、共八千餘金、全屬私人供給、故余僅代表我中華之國民而巳、</p>
<p>海行安適　余等於八月二十一日由洛山磯起程、二十六日由舊金山乘柯立芝輪返國、同行者有上海西僑靑年會體窗部總幹事托平、及梯生等、車　權尙須逗　月餘　國、海行　爲安適、一路風平淸靜、無顚波之苦、</p>
<p>美人歡迎　余等在美、美國人民處處表示熱烈歡迎、愛護倍至、卽如余與賽失敗後、亦均來握手、似代余表示十分遺憾、對日本電手、反甚冷淡、日處處表示譏諷態度、卽在運動會中之觀衆、見日　手有跌仆或失敗者、竟不約而同發出一種譏諷之聲、惟日選手而皮甚厚、總是拚命去幹、</p>
<p>今晨北上　余與宋先生（君復）原定十八日赴北平、但宋先生家中忽遭土匪擄刦、故無心再多勾留、决定今日上午乘早車由滬赴京、轉平浦車北上、原定滬上一切酬酢、均行辭謝云、</p>

<p>旗會　大會塲中末次運動節目終丁（騎馬跳賽）立將各種器具移去、五百員軍樂隊、及二千人組織之唱歌班、進場再奏、繼由專員持國名旗及國旗列隊遊行、與開幕禮時相似、各國選手因巳有回國、故俱未參加、進行畢、旗　齊集於司令臺前、成一半圈形曰「旗會、」</p>
<p>演說　閉幕禮由下列諸人演說、辭簡潔、但甚懇切、（一）亞林羣克會長白拉島伯爵、（ＣＣＵＮＴdeBalleLatout）（二）洛杉機市長寳德、（Ｐortor）（三）美國籌備委員會主席茄蘭特（Ｇarland）（四）德</p>

<p>鳴砲　全塲肅立至演說終了時、亞林辟克旗徽（全校異色穿連圓圈）下降、燃着十六晝夜之火炬、給此撲滅、同時砲響角鳴、全塲肅靜、高塔上并起美德荷三國旗、示九·十·十一三屆主辦大會升國度之意、</p>
<p>尾聲　唱歌班高唱「Ａloha-TillWeMeetAgain」歌畢、各國旗徽相繼退出大看臺下、漸漸隱滅、大會旗由八人平携至塲之中心、及歌聲終了、卽將旗捲起、盛大之運動會卽於此告終、（亞林辟克村及會場新聞席之紀載明日發表）</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>槍口是要向外的，我們喊口號的這張口，不要專向着外界高呼，郤要注重在内心作用，而喚醒自己不曾汩没的天良！</p>
<p>專向着外界高呼口號，自己喝一句，人家隨聲附和的照樣喝一句；說的好，是呌做喚醒國魂；說的不好，是呌做聊齋志異上的田雞敎書，又呌做香山匠人的打哼，宣卷先生的和佛。</p>
<p>古人遇着國仇家恥，是吩咐他人向我個人喚口號，而不是我個人向大衆喚口號，吳王夫差便是個模範者。他要報越王殺父之仇，郤敎他人立在庭中向自己大聲疾呼道：丨夫差！而忘越王之殺爾父乎？</p>
<p>古人鞭策自己，又有自己向自己喚口號！這個口號，不是高呼，郤是默誦，曾子便是個模範者。他每日三省其身，便是每日向自己默誦三回口號，呌做：丨爲人謀而不忠乎？與朋友交而不信乎？傳不習乎？口號不如心號、曾子的鞭策方法，更比夫差沈着一些：九一八的週年已到了，我願人人採取曾子的心號方法，每日三省，默默的鞭策着本人救國的内心作用。</p>
<p>會塲喚口號。固然是不可少的！我的意思，心號比着口號更重，在會塲中喚過口號的，尤其要每日三省其身的默呼着心號。</p>
<h3 id="c40">上海小姐 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 白石</p>
<p>上海人稱女孩兒家，呌做小姐。小姐本末甚希罕，女孩兒家，閨女，丫頭，大姑娘，都是一類的，隨着各地的風俗，隨意喊喊罷了。但是「小姐之上，加了「上海」二字，却就大大的不同。「上海小姐」，並不是住在上海的小姐，都可算爲上海小姐的。上海小姐的形成，却是有條件的。現在我大略的把形成上海小姐的條件說一說。</p>
<p>上海小姐降生的時候，同先聖列賢一樣的與旁人没甚分别。但是到了十歲左右，做父母的倘使預備女兒將來要形成一位上海小姐的話，那麽，必須把伊送到貴族化的學校裏去。進這種學校的目的，並不在乎程度，課程等等，第一是要使女兒懂得甚麽呌做「美」，「美」是如何養成的。下課之後，不可令伊處理家務，因爲煑飯，洗衣，抹桌，掃地，根本就是破壞「美」的工作。課餘的唯一工作，是練習歌舞，因爲歌是發音器官的練習，舞，可使股肉的發達平匀，曲線的度數增加，此外還有吃巧克力，留蘭香糖，汽水，冰其林，也是很重要的。因爲這種腸胃的鍜練，對於將來的交際前途，也是非常有益的。從此由小學而中學，一直到大學畢業，不變方法的這樣訓練着，再加些觀電影，吃大菜，坐汽車的課程，自然而然的會成爲一位手面闊綽，合乎時代，旣健且美的交際明星，或是說，社會之花，或是說，上海小姐了。</p>
<p>上海小姐的形成，不是輕而易舉的一回事。没有豪富的父親，華貴的環境，莫想做上海小姐。有些没有經適當的訓練，而拚命的學做上海小姐，那眞是寃。</p>

<p>丨糾正幾個誤解丨</p>
<p>我國的文字，每一個字有一個字的意義，雖然有許多詞是要併合起幾個字然後成功一個新意義的，尤其是音譯和直取的外來語，然而國人有許多因爲對於每個字有每個字的意義的觀念深了，所以對於這些外來語仍不免有每個字去解釋的觀念，因此會弄出許多笑話或誤解，例如在廣東最初行用銅元的時候，因爲没有相當的習慣上的名稱，同時又有了香港銅幣先入的原固，便直取英文的ＣＥＮＴＳ音譯作「仙士」：但是有一部份迷信的人以爲這樣稱呼銅臭，未免褻凟了「仙」和「士」，尤其是「仙」之不容褻凟，於是諱稱之曰「大錢」，曰「鏍」。這個「鏍」字讀如「累」字的淸平聲：在我們童年的時候，這種銅元的别稱是很通行的：現在廣東的鄉村還有人這樣呌着。又如近年流行的「模特兒」一個詞，本來是英語的ＭＯＤＥＬ的譯音，原來的意義是模型，模範，所以給人作繪畫的範型人物也呌作模特兒：其實你如果拿一隻狗，一條牛來作繪畫的型勢也可以稱作模特兒。但是望文生義的社會，因爲這個名詞尾巴上有了一個女兒的兒子字，又因爲女體範型的寫生繪畫，於是硬派定模特兒作爲裸體女子的專稱，甚至以模特兒爲一個猥褻可恥的名詞了。這眞是笑話。又如「幽默」，也是從英語ＨＵＭＯＵＲ音譯出來的，原意是含有「諧趣」而耐人玩味的意思，與滑稽相近，但是那個創譯者因爲滑稽這個詞給人家用得出了岔子了，簡直含有點下流胡鬧的意味，所以他不把Ｈomour譯作滑稽而别譯作幽默。其實幽默這個詞也不算譯得不好，不過這兩個字太有意義了，因爲這兩字恰巧是形容詞性，而兩個字的意義又極相近，於是給望文生義的朋友見了又發生誤解了。誤解且不打緊，而且居然誤用，他們把幽默當作了靜默，幽靜用。這又是一個大笑話丨最近流行的「法西斯蒂」「布爾喬亞」等詞，如果給望文生義的朋友看見了不知又要作何感想丨</p>

<p>「我不知道除了你以外，還有些什麽人，除非是我的國家，我的故鄉。我爲了你而流血，我爲了你而情願犧牲我的一切，我在戰塲上没有受傷，但是我心中己受了極大的創傷，除了你可以醫治外，任何人都不能療治。我願意把性命獻給全中華民族，不想將得到什麽榮譽，但是至少在你處，取到以前所損失的愛情權利；因爲當時我不是軍人，所以被一個軍人丨丨你的丈夫搶了去、我知道你崇拜武士，而且是勇敢的武士，所以拚命抵抗外侮。將來一切，我不願意想，我只願依舊服膺你的主義，繼續我的工作。」</p>
<p>「我還不明白你如何到現在方始找到了我，以前是怎樣了呢」</p>
<p>「」在前天，諸綺伯的女兒，曾到城裏見我，伊是一個人情悄悄而來的，伊的目的在表示伊眞語的愛與我，要我明白一個姑娘兒崇拜一位英雄而情願施愛於他，是一件極平常的事；但是全鎭的人，都由伊勸說，一致的崇拜一位英雄，大家捐錢，是極不易容的事，伊還告訴我，說鎭上有一個瘋婆，和一個窮孀婦，都捐了錢，這是狠值得人感動的。我告訴伊，我已有了一位狠美麗而聰明多情的太太，我已十分滿意，不久可以介紹給鎭上人見一見。爲國犧牲，是國民的責任、不足視爲怎樣特别榮譽的事，所以建碑的事，最好取銷了吧。」</p>
<p>「那麽你又怎知道這窮孀便是我，而我又住在這裏呢？」</p>
<p>「伊又說這是你自謙，你功在國家，婦孺都崇拜你，眞是值得讚揚的啊！像這個孀婦自已生活的狠苦的，還養着一個不相干的瘋婦，居然也凑一筆捐，不是你英雄的榮譽麽？伊這樣重複地贊美這位孀婦，我便問伊是什麽名字，住在那裏，伊一一都告訴我，並且願意在舉行落成禮的日子，領我來見見這位孀婦，所以我默記在心，驚奇而且感謝這位諸姑娘，聽說伊向我吻了一吻而分别，我才允許行落成禮一定親自參加。」</p>
<p>「給伊吻了没有？」</p>
<p>「是的，伊在我手背上深深地吻了一下呢。」</p>
<p>「那你應該歡喜了，有人給你造紀念碑，有人給你香吻，你該滿意了！」</p>
<p>「但是，我心上的創痕，你總不允許我醫療。」</p>
<p>「聽說今天担任揭幕的，便是這位諸小姐，你應該快些到會，免得伊深深盼望與心中的不安。」</p>
<p>「軍人要幾個女人來安慰，是狠容易，但是要能彀嘹解軍人心裏的是没有；尤其是我，不需要獻媚如俎上的肉，而渴求着一個女人的聖潔神靈之精神。」</p>

<p>外論社云、日本冒世界之不諱、悍然承認僞國本埠各西報、各有社論評其事、其中除泰晤士報以日人之立塲、出言袒護强辯、謂「日本自知身受世界輿論之裁判、而春照行其劃出之途徑、毫無猶預、正足證其信其行爲正當之力量、」大陸報譏慶祝之杯、「爲罪犯最後所服之一劑、」又譏僞國由自日本保護、駐兵、不須担任費用、爲「不勞而獲、」若南京再不從速醒悟、亦必「不勞而獲、」含義至深、惟因係國人立塲、均不足爲例外、其他各報見地各有不同、茲分摘大要於下，</p>
<p>法文日報「日本於此舉担負一切費用及作不顧國内外發生反響與否之冒險一試、無非因其處於保護者之地位、有最高管理國務之權、可於在滿辦理實業或公共事業之經騐、及保障其利益之無虞失落之前提下、由一己之私意、擬訂各種條文、……中國政府將依其慣例、向國際作無實效的呼籲、將來或發覺走入歧途、於最後五分鐘内、另闢生路、……莫斯科必將與東京訂一互惠條約、一方仍繼續在其勢力範圍内、作秘密活動、其他各國、則不將有所表示、而以李頓報告書爲面本、中國政府、對此收穫極微、雖曾向世界散布種子、吾儕將稱之爲虚妄政策、……事變之初、如中國採取較實際之政策、則可强令日本宣布其慾望而不再作愈份行動、如此可獲相當效果、乃自願立即投入國際公斷之泥潭中、……今已深陷及頸矣、……角力鬥智、方在萌芽時代、結束當遙遙無期、在此時期、日本可致於鞏固滿洲國之基礎、而中國則惟有引領鵠候、呈嗟呻吟、或終至失却耐心、…」</p>
<p>俄文日報　日本正式承認滿洲之舉、亦係正式開始爭取太平洋之日、他年遠東將成世界大變之中心、苟無第三者之力爲阻、日本將完成其鞏固滿洲之事業、滿洲一固、則日本最近歷史前途、在太平洋之鬥爭亦固、此鬥爭之參與國、將準備一切以赴之、因滿洲獨立成功、俄國遠東即成孤立、……將造不用一兵、不折一矢、而使其歸屬日本勢力範圍之下、蘇聯不能不顧慮及此、……一俟歷史時機巳至、日本須出滿境而入俄國遠東時、誰復與之爲敵、……國際及俄國之計劃中遠東環境若是構成、歷史將使此環境爲之一變、但非近數年之歷史、而將爲近數十年之歷史也、</p>
<p>大美晚報　依據日本帝國之觀點、僅統治鐡道區域實爲未足、與中國交涉、旣不能得一自身立塲視爲滿意之解决、日本依其自己之模型、進行培養保護與組織之獨立國家、現在自信有如母子之關係、而能干涉之矣、……世界各富强國家、深信繼續擴張勢力之結果、爲流血與戰爭、而自瀕於崩潰、……最近將來之戰爭、毫無問題、設若各國能不使領土增加、勢力擴大、則戰爭或有止息之可能也、…　　字林西報　其主要大意、以我國前次僅向國聯聲訴、而不援引九國公約、今次援引九國公約、而又不通知國聯、手續欠週、兩均可憾、</p>

<p>美俄與日本　記者旋詢以對日外交問題、及日美日俄戰爭之可能性、伍氏立振其外交家之雄辯、反覆申述、多中肯要、伍氏之言曰、國聯調查團之報告書、其結論雖聞於我國有利、然事實上國聯實無辦法、度此困難之局面、今日本旣承認僞國國人所望於國聯者、恐終將成爲畫餅、至日美戰爭、於最近之將來、恐亦未易實現、美海軍中人、曾著有理想日美戰爭小說、其内容略謂、日美戰爭、必以中國某地爲爆發點、開戰後、日海軍於三日内可佔領菲島、檀香山亦有危險、美最后勝利在於能持久云云、蓋深知美海軍長途遠征之弱點、故今日美政府有未取得外交上之奥援外、絶未能有積極之表示、至日俄戰爭、雖比較有可能性、但現在蘇俄方在竭力整理内部、使社會經濟、趨於安定、對於外來之壓迫、抱極端忍受主義、即對外宣傳赤化、最近亦巳减低力量、故雖以日方種種挑釁、俄國節節退讓、絶不至發生正面衝突、又可斷言也云云、</p>
<p>救國惟自救　伍氏又謂、國聯旣無能爲、日美日俄戰爭又不可能、則我人將坐令東北三省之淪亡、束手無策乎、日、救國惟自救、一方面東北各地之義勇軍、在困苦萬難中、作不斷的抵抗、另一方面民衆厲行經濟絶交、則日本雖得東北、軍費之支出浩敏、同時因義軍之擾亂、影響其生産量、屆時其國内必感覺得不償失之痛苦、我國乘機運用外交、或可操最后之勝利也、</p>
<p>不任外交官　記者又詢以倘中央擬借重先生、擔任外交事宜、先生作何表示、伍民答稱、余此次擬由水道北上、暫不往京、即中央有此意、余以才力薄弱、必不敢拜命、蓋辦外交、必須國内一致、否則政府與民衆意見紛歧、而政府中人復人自爲政、則對外有何辦法之可言云云、伍氏又稱、孫哲生先生不日即來滬、長行政院說、余未前聞、至胡展堂先生暫時並無來滬之意、</p>
<p>願復長瓊崖　關於瓊崖特區長官職務、伍氏謂、始終未曾辭去、惟現因瓊崖地方不靖、俟平靖後、仍願前往就職也云云、</p>
<p>林主席往訪　昨日下午五時、國府主席林森、親往戈登路伍氏寓邸、訪晤伍氏、詢粤中情形頗詳、談論約半小時、始行興辭、</p>

<p>引起日艦誤會</p>
<p>幾釀重大糾紛</p>
<p>十四日夜中、江順輪因水巡隊檢查烟土、開入手槍、致引起日艦誤會、派兵上輪搜查、經船主力阻始巳、該輪巳於昨晨出口、詳情如次、</p>
<p>查土糾紛　江順輪、此次從漢口開滬、進口後、停泊南棧碼頭、十四日下午八時許、有水巡隊長警多名、至船搜檢烟土、各處抄查、未有發見、水警即到火艙内、向船上加油夫錢彩雲、嚴詞盤詰、責令交出、錢不服、遂發生衝突、水警復將生火更夫等三人、傳閉火艙、嚴行盤詰、亦激起爭執、彼此毆打、三生火又遭毆傷、</p>
<p>開放空槍　此事發生後、船上輪機長　爾登ＧＧoulton得報、急入火艙、見海員中四人、已受傷、遂與水警爭論、水警又將其腿部擊靑、乃出艙而至甲板、當時水警拔出手槍、朝天開放六七響、不意引起日本海軍之誤會、幾釀重大事故、</p>
<p>日艦誤會　水警放槍之時、附近江面停有日本海軍第十五隊軍艦一艘、一聞槍聲、即放探海燈照射、查察槍聲由來、當爲日艦照悉、由江順輪内發出、遂由該艦派兵一隊、至該輪檢查、</p>
<p>欲施檢查　日軍艦即派海軍一隊、由軍官一名率領、即放小火輪一艘、載該兵至南市碼頭前、擅入我國商輪内、經江順主麥德惠安出而阻止、日軍詢問槍聲自來、而該船主以船上由華水警執行查檢任務、故有槍聲、對於日艦絶無關係、此時船上水警、巳經船主勸退、而日海軍初時堅欲檢查、經船主一再堅拒、歷半小時之久、始行退去、</p>
<p>呈報當局　日軍退去、後水警又二次到輪、曾搜出烟土兩包、當時因錢彩雲傷勢甚重、故將生火等三人帶去、嗣後將受傷之海員四名、由局送到某醫院施治、關於檢出烟土船上之人、堅不承認、昨日、該局巳將水警查土、與海員衝突、及放槍引起日海軍誤會、派兵武裝上輪、强欲搜查等情形、懇市府向日方交涉制止、以免再有同樣之事件發生云、</p>
<p>隊員談話　本報記者、昨特往訪水巡隊、據該隊某隊員聲稱、查近兩月來、本隊迭次在行駛長江各輪上、破獲大批烟土鉅案、本隊因責職所在、未敢稍忽、故凡有輪船抵埠、自必遵令加以嚴查、况江順輪由漢口啓椗時、本隊即得密報、謂該輪此次自漢來滬、火艙内藏帶大批烟土、故待該輪抵埠時、當晚即由本隊長警上輪搜查、詎料當時因彼衆我寡、若輩竟敢先向警士奪取槍械、並同時用木棍鐡尺、實行拒捕、警土等爲自衛起見、遂不得不開槍示威、而結果本隊警士一人且受重傷、亦可知若輩當時蠻橫一斑、但最後終於在該輪火艙内抄獲烟土兩麻袋計九大包、並由長警拘獲三人、人滅巳一併申解司法科、至於當時日本海軍發生誤會、本隊更無從負責、現巳由本隊隊長具情分報局長及市長核辦矣、</p>

<p>鐡道路業務司司長俞棪</p>
<p>在中央廣播電台講演詞</p>
<p>今天鄙人所講的題目、是「貨物負責運輸的意義及與國計民生之關係」、什麽呌作貨物負責運輸、簡單的說、貨物負責運輸、就是鐡路對於貨商所託運的貨物、自從收到貨物的時候起、至將貨物運到目的地交付收貨人止、在這個時間以内、鐡路要擔負相當的保管責任、要擔負安全敏捷的運送責任、要擔負相當的損害賠償責任、换一句話說、就是鐡路對於貨商的貨物、看作如同自己的東西一樣、盡力使他不受絲毫損害和延誤完妥的交到收貨人、除非因爲不可抗力的天災事變、或是貨物自己性質上的變化、或是貨商自己的過失以外、倘若貨物發生了損失、鐡路要負賠償責任的、</p>
<p>世界各國鐡路、對於貨商所託運的貨物、没有不負責任的都是盡他職務上所能辦到的、來替商人謀便利謀幸福、凡是貨物的損害、只要是在鐡路責任上所不應當發生的、没有不賠償的鐡路抽負的責任、旣然很重、他的設備和人員的辦事方面、不得不力求周密完善、貨商對於鐡路、也就愈加信賴、在名義上講、路商雖是分開的、但在事實上是一體的、所以他們鐡路的貨運、一天比一天增加、一般商民營業、也一天比一天的發展、國家富强、這自然是一個很大的原因、但是反過來看看我們中國的鐡路、對於貨運是如何的情况、我們的鐡路對於所運的貨物、向來是不負任何責任的、因爲不負責任的關係、鐡路的設備上、得將就就將就、鐡路人員辦事上、得敷衍就敷衍、久而久之、員司養成一種官僚惡習、鐡路失刦營業本質、貨商託由鐡路運送的貨物、不但是毫没有安全的保障、並目感受種種不便、貨商因爲血本的關係、不得不另想出路、因此遂發生種種弊端、最顯見的、就要算轉運公司了、貨商因爲免除自己向官僚式的鐡路員司交涉的麻煩、爲求貨物安全不受損失、不得不託由轉運公司代向鐡路報運、轉運公司因利益所在、遂乘機襲斷、任意居奇、甚或勾結車站不肖員司、上下其手、一般貨商大受剝削、五十餘年以來、鐡路貨運一天比一天的衰落、商民痛苦、一天比一天的加重、一直到了現在、貨商幾至無法自存、鐡路也漸漸趨於破産慘狀、假如我們再没有根本救濟的辦法、只好是大家等着同歸於盡了、</p>
<p>這種的危險情形、在十年前早已看到了、國人也早已要想法挽救了、所以在民國十年、前交通部招集全國鐡路運輸會議時候、就决定了實行貨物負責運輸、同時頒布了負責運輸通則、但是因爲種種原因、各路都没有澈底認眞實行、這十年的工夫、空空白過、鐡路貨運種種的弊端、較前更深、商民的痛苦、較前更大、到了現在、無論從那一方面着想各路貨運、是再不容不加以根本的整頓了、整頓貨運惟一的辦法、就是實行負責運輸、因爲實行負責運輸、鐡路對於貨商的責任加重、設備自然要求完善、員司自然要認眞辦事、絲毫不容苟且、商民運貨、才能有正軌可循、才能得到眞正的便利、已往的種種積弊、才能根本剷除、種種積弊、根本剷除、才能談得到發展商業、發展社會經濟、爲一般民衆謀幸福、這就是鐡道部這次决然厲行負責運輸最大的動機、和最重要的目的、</p>
<p>貨物負責運輸、是鐡路運貨上根本原則、違反這種原則、就是鐡路放棄他的使命自然不會有好結果的、我們的鐡路、所以有現在的惡劣現象、商民感受極度的痛苦、就是因爲違反這種原則的原故我們實行負責運輸以後、不但可以挽回從前的惡劣結果、前途更可以有無窮的希望這是自然的道理、可以斷言的就拿我們九月一日開始實行負責運輸的津浦京滬兩路來說、他們實行負責運輸的車站、一切辦理貨物的人員、因責任的關係都將從前的積習完全改變辦事的精神、也完全商業化了貨商方面、也感覺種種例利對於負責運輸、少數懷疑誤解的貨商也漸漸的明白了所以兩路的負責貨運、一天比一天的增加、在九月一日開辦的第一天津浦路負責貨物是三四○噸、京滬滬杭甬路是一四○噸、十餘日以來、津浦路已增加至二五一○噸京滬滬杭甬已增至二五八○噸、而一般貨商紛紛函請兩路積極擴充負責的辦法交口稱便這足見負責運輸對於一般貨商需要的迫切了由此推想假如兩路全棧完全實行後他的結果是怎樣再推想全國各路完全實行後、他的結果又當怎樣我們可以斷然的說等到將來各路一律實行負責運輸以後、可以舉辦各路負責聯運水陸聯運和國際聯運到了那個時候、一天比一天的全國工商各業必發展、社會經濟也必一天比一天的發達、那才算鐡路眞盡到他所負的使命了</p>
<p>少數的商人及少數的轉運公司、因爲特種的關係、對於負責運輸不免有不便於已的懷疑這實在是没有把負責運輸眞正的面目和精神認識淸楚的原因也是没有把眼光放遠的原因我們要透澈的想一想我們的工商各業到了這一種衰敗的地步、國民生計到了這一種危險的時期我們非要從改革建設上謀出路是别無他法可以挽救的不應當因己往的習慣或是目前的利益把遠大前途的利害忘掉負責運輸是爲一般貨商謀永久的出路爲國計民生謀永久的解决、不是專爲鐡路自身謀利益、社會經濟問題解决、全國各業自然都受到利益若是專顧自己目前的小利試問等到鐡路破産、各業破産轉運業、能不能獨存、明白這個道理、自然就不必懷疑了、並且負責運輸實行後、貨運流暢運輸公司營業、自能日趨發達、更大可不必過慮了、</p>
<p>總一句話說負責運輸是整理我國鐡路運輸惟一的辦法也就是解除商民痛苦發展社會經濟的根本大道全國各界要一齊起來、通力合作、把這一件大事完成、這就是本部的熱烈希望、也就是全國民衆的熱烈希望</p>

<p>稽考史蹟，中國過去及現在的敎育，幾乎全被豪富階級所獨佔了，淸季以前的科學制度，你若不是家世淵源，膏火裕如，芸窗十年，那你便莫想把書讀好，遑言登科中舉，因爲那種迂古敎育，劈頭就讀四書五經，隨你如何用工，起首兩三年功夫，總是寃枉糟榻了，最多只能認得幾個白眼子，若想移用到生活上去，煞是困難，于是窮人没福份，只得代代不通古今了，其後受了西洋文明的激盪，于是在光緖年間，慌脚慌手把此制度廢除，代之以學校敎育，原始用意，本在普及敎育，那知事實竟大謬不然，因爲政治不上軌道，野心政客從中攬權，每將敎育塲所一學校，攫來樹植私人勢力，招致黨羽，于是神聖的敎育界，便常演卑汚活劇，更形成一畸形象態，即大家都趨鶩似的向上層敎育中大學之發展，把基本的下層敎育，丢開不管，以故辦學愈久，敎育愈不普及，歐美各國，則反乎是，所重者在下層敎育，而舉國之大學，不若我上海一隅之多，是以彼邦敎育，是日趨繁榮，絶不像中國的尾大不掉，亂七八糟，並且眼看中匣的敎育，巳日益貴族化與商業化了，大學固然辦得很多，中學尤如比櫛的商店似的，你辦一爿，我辦一爿，一條馬路上可以找出好幾爿，一般辦學的，除了私樹勢力以外，便假着這幌子，從中牟利，學費及其他費用，昻貴絶頂，鵠的旣如此卑汚，内容自然不堪聞問，只要有的是袁頭，（鈔票也可）便可寫寫意進去，考試是敷衍場面，敎員尤迎奉學生，如從「野鷄學校」這徽號上想想，更可意像到不免有亂拉學生的活劇，在這種敎育制度之下，你若不是財産裕如的豪富階級，便無法踏進中學校的門庭，更不要夢想進大學，因爲那兒都無形的掛上了「學校重地，窮人莫入」，的兩塊方牌頭，事實是這樣的註定了你的命運，高深敎育的享受，深遠學理的探討，是豪富階級的專利權，窮人兒是没份的，只好望洋興嘆似的與學絶緣吧，基此，所以我想找一個如此補救的辦法來，丨舉辦民衆圖書館，好使一般好學而又無錢升學的窮人兒，在生活重壓之下，也可得些自修學問的機會，</p>

<h3 id="c104">墨水與消墨水之作法 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>墨水在吾國約三千年前就有了。在西方的埃及也很早就有用煤和油製成的墨汁。到十一世紀就有人以鞣酸和鐡的化合的製出墨水。但是它的質却比不上現在的墨水。至於我們現在所用的墨水是經過許多學者長時間研究的結果，而是距今約七十三年呌做列恩哈爾地氏改良的。</p>
<p>墨水的作法·其中最重要的藥品是鞣酸（ＴＡＮＮＩＣＡＣＩＤ）和硫酸亞鐡（ＦＥＲＲＯＵＳＳＵＬＰＨＡＴＥ）。本來祇要有這兩種藥品就可以作墨水，但是爲要質防沈澱和發霉，所以還要加些别的藥品。並且其分量也有一定而作法也很多。現在將藥品以及分量寫於下：</p>
<p>鞣酸　二三·四克　没食子酸　七·七克　硫酸亞鐡三○·○克鹽酸二·五克　阿拉伯樹膠一○·○克石炭酸一·○克　水一○○○·○克</p>
<p>這樣混成的是無色墨水，就是須等到寫後才能變黑色。所以還要加幾克烟硵（ＡＭＩＬＩＮＥ），那末就可以製出藍黑墨水。</p>
<p>紅墨水的作法</p>
<p>紅墨水的作法極簡單。其藥品如下：</p>
<p>紅染料ＥＯＳＩＮ二○克阿拉伯樹膠二○克酒精五○克石炭酸少量水一○○○克</p>
<p>紫墨水的作法</p>
<p>甲基一○克砂糖一○克草酸二克水一○○○克</p>
<p>消墨水的作法</p>
<p>把檸檬酸和酒石酸草酸，以同樣分量混成便可以作出消墨水。</p>
<p>消墨粉的作法</p>
<p>如果墨水没有乾而要消去紙上的字的時候，消墨水便失去其功用：所以須用明礬·琥珀·硫黃以同樣的分量混合，然後才用綢或棉花在紙上擦，就可以消去紙上的字。</p>

<h3 id="c105">改良婦女服裝之建議 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 警愚</p>
<p>男子服裝，已由張滄粟君建議改良，而婦女服裝，雖有懷靜誠君之建議，然僅改良其一部份的短褲，殊非所以澈底之道，因爲婦女服裝，根本有改良之必要，而弗容有所忽視的，爰將管見所及，臚陳如后，</p>
<p>我國婦女的服裝，在今日社會，可謂極盡陸離光怪之大觀，至於非中非西，亦中亦西，大都推陳出新，自矜奇詭，更有所謂新裝公司，從而推波助瀾，積極提倡，材料必取舶來，製法定崇歐化，轉將我國固有的絲織品，束之高閣，致造成生産過賸的恐慌，一方面復養婦女奢侈的心理與陋習，馴至發生經濟壓迫，道德墮落，家庭變故等種種流弊。</p>
<p>就拿現在夏天的製衣材料而論，大槪摩登化的婦女，都用一種薄如蟬翼的紗綢，是類紗綢，來自歐美，價值奇昻，製成衣服，果然輕似霧穀，凉爽異常</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，可是肌肉公開，靑年受其誘惑，因而誤入歧途者，不乏春人，敗壞風化，莫此爲甚！</p>
<p>就是普通所御的旗袍，何嘗不是沿襲滿淸舊習，（因是旗人服裝，所以稱做旗袍），在此革命潮流之下，烏容任其存在，况乎眞正旗袍，倒還寛博而適體，唯是目前流行的旗袍，早巳改得纎腰穿袖，不像樣子，穿在身上，怎爲舒服，加之牠的下擺多無衩，即或開衩，也祗二三寸高，等於未開，因是行動旣不方便，乘船登車，尤極費事，記得前年有一女子，有浦江趁輪，方當登輪之際，因被旗袍的下擺圍裹，不得展開大步，以致墮入浦中，遽遭滅頂、這樣看來，這種衣服是有損無益的！古者異服必誅，像目下一般婦女所服，才算是異服！可稱在必誅之列！</p>
<p>基上理由，所以婦女服裝，應有改良的必要，至於改良到如何程度，鄙意不妨仍以舊時的衣裙爲標準，而加斟酌損益，俾全國婦女，上衣下裙，趨於一致，穿着起來，也不致感覺不便，而發生傾跌的危險，就是觀瞻方面，亦頗儀態大方，毫不傷雅，選材一層，則應由政府明令提倡，限用國産絲織品，絶對禁用外貨，庶幾國貨暢銷，漏巵可塞，是否有當，仍請提交各會員共同討論，至爲企盼。</p>
<p>悲慘的一幕</p>
<h3 id="c106">姑母 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 玲</p>
<p>當我聽到姑母已經在人世間消逝了的時候，我足足痴呆地悲傷了好幾天！</p>
<p>我想到她那灰白色的頭髮，想到她那慘白色的面龐，想到她那柔軟的手掌，想到她那簡陋而淸爽的房屋臥室。凡是我的腦海裏所能記憶的一切，關於我姑母的一切，我都想到了！我想到這一切的一切時，我的心靈裏就好像失去了什麽東西似的，異常地難受與空虚！</p>
<p>未滿四歲便失去了母親的我，那眞是非常地可憐而又可憫！我想，假如當時没有像姑母那樣的人來撫養我時，我眞不知道要變成什麽樣的一種人！我想，我現在假如還可以說有一點靈慧的話，那顯然是我親愛的姑母所給予的。同時，我相信我有「愛」的認識的話，那也只是由姑母所給予的，除了我那可親近的姑母之外，誰還向我看過親善的一眼！</p>
<p>對照得很好的是我姑丈的兇暴！雖然他在我到他家裏的第二年便已死去，但他時常在洶酒之後，怒氣冲天地把我當作洩氣洞來發洩他滿腹怨氣的情景，却永遠永遠地，像毒蛇似咬住我的心，無論如何也不會忘記！</p>
<p>「你這個衰鬼，誰要你到我家來，你的母親已經給你害死（聽說我的八字很硬，我的母親便是給我的命硬死的，）你的家已經給你拆散，現在又要拆散我們的家嗎？你這個衰鬼！……衰鬼！……」</p>
<p>這種刻毒的兇很的惡駡時常都把我駡得哭了又哭；雖然我的姑母很和靄地把我拉到她的身邊或廚房裏去，用着柔和的話語來安慰我，但姑丈的惡駡總還得繼續下去。有時還用着恐嚇的口吻說：「你再哭！…你再不歇聲！…你這哭衰人的衰鬼！…我眞非把你打死不可！，</p>
<p>…」，時常都嚇得我不敢哭出來而又不可能地咳嗽起來！</p>
<p>眞的，在没有了自己的母親的我，父親又不能不爲着自己的生活爲人傭工，而無法來撫育我的當時，姑母竟能不顧姑丈的埋怨來撫育我，這眞令人越想越追慕的呵！</p>
<p>我想，姑母之如此愛我，也許因爲她没有親生的兒子吧！當我在小學校讀書的時候，她總是時常地在勉勵我；「阿玲，你得好好地用功呵！爲着你窮苦的父親，爲着你破敗了的家庭爲着你將來的事業！」當時我便被愛撫得像馴順的羔羊似的一天也不停地進學校裏去讀書！雖然我現在的身體非常文弱，但我一點也不敢怨埋她把我管敎得那樣馴順　　特别是當學期考試完畢，我拿着的奬品回到家中的時候，姑母總是緊緊地把我抱着，拚命地摸撫着我的頭面！喜歡的笑顔當中包含着淸苦的熱淚！有時還突然的問我；</p>
<p>「阿玲，你將來大了，發達了，還記得姑母嗎？」當我大堀而頑皮地回答說「記得」丨的時候，她便會哈哈地笑起來的。</p>
<p>「要記得才好呢！阿玲」</p>
<p>有時她喜歡得就像發呆，緊緊的拉着我的雙手眼睛仰視着天空，好像那遠遠的將來，一定會有美滿而快樂的境地！當她發呆之後，便熱烈地抱我吻我，摸撫我！</p>
<p>但是現在呢？她却被窮困的生活壓榨死了。她一生所憬憧的希求，也始終在現實的鐡蹄底下毁滅了！因此她在咽着最後一口氣時，也是飽含着眼淚的丨唉！這是多殘酷而悲慘的啊！</p>

<h3 id="e1">How Should the Chinese People Confront Today's Crisis? <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>By Hua</p>
<p>Foreign troubles and internal woes seem to have a permanently intertwined cause and effect. Internal unrest is enough to invite foreign aggression, and foreign aggression can amplify internal unrest. History bears this out repeatedly, and China's current situation is no exception. China today is deeply troubled internally, and facing extremely serious foreign threats. How can we salvage this precarious situation? This is indeed a pressing question for the Chinese people to resolve.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident last year, the Chinese people have been in constant anxiety. Now, Japan has gone further by recognizing a puppet organization and signing a treaty with it, intending to permanently separate the Northeast from our territory. Moreover, it is taking the opportunity to covet Rehe, destabilize North China, and extend its influence throughout our country. Even in the Northeast, there are still loyal and brave volunteer armies fighting actively, so Japan's plan to invade us may not entirely succeed. However, if our country merely waits passively for the League of Nations or the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to take action, without devising any plans of our own, how can we resist Japan's relentless invasion?</p>
<p>The situation in the Northeast is undoubtedly perilous. Looking back at the Southwest, Japanese newspapers claim that "with British assistance, they are attacking Yunnan and Qinghai from both sides, seeking to completely take control of Kang and Tibet and build a Great Tibet like in the Tang Dynasty." Although this is deliberate propaganda by the Japanese, aiming to divert our attention to the Southwest and facilitate their invasion of the Northeast, the situation in Kang and Tibet has been critical for a long time. Recently, various groups in Qinghai telegraphed the central government urgently, with the following poignant words: "In the past, the disaster in the Northeast was urgent, while the disaster in the Southwest was slow. Now, the disaster in the Southwest is also pressing. In the past, the Northeast fell because the people did not pay attention to it. If the people still do not pay attention to the Southwest, then the Southwest will also fall." Thus, the Southwest is also in imminent danger. China's border troubles are not limited to the Northeast alone.</p>
<p>With the border troubles so profound, what about the situation inside China? The simple answer is that we are overwhelmed with anxieties. Economically, the countryside is heading towards bankruptcy, the number of unemployed is increasing daily, and the nation's finances are becoming increasingly depleted. Law and order are also affected. In terms of domestic politics, the people resent the government's weakness in the face of foreign aggression and its inability to repel the strong enemy. The government, in turn, blames the people for acting emotionally and not understanding its calm and peaceful approach. The constant turmoil only deepens the foreign troubles and multiplies internal problems. Moreover, the more internal problems there are, the more opportunities arise for the great powers to scramble for advantages in China. Alas, precious time is wasted in this way, day after day, and great disasters lie ahead. The cause for concern regarding this phenomenon is undeniable.</p>
<p>However, "its fall, its fall, is tied to the mulberry bush." If the Chinese people can truly feel the imminent threat of national peril and set aside internal prejudices, devising effective countermeasures against external enemies and working together with one heart and mind to save ourselves, then the current critical situations may well serve as a good remedy for resolving internal woes and alleviating external troubles. "A nation without external enemies will always perish." With a formidable enemy at our doorstep, looking around, has any country offered us substantial assistance in the past year? If the Chinese people can awaken from this and abandon the idea of relying on foreign aid, quickly establishing a way to cope on our own, then the past stumbles may well become the starting point for a smooth path in the future. And that enemy nation will not only be unable to destroy us but will also provide the stimulus for our resurrection. If we continue on our current path without changing our ways, facing great disasters while still being complacent, unaware of the need for unity, disregarding urgency, and unwilling to sacrifice individual interests to save the greater whole, abandoning private gains to preserve the public good, then the consequences will be unbearable to speak of. Awakening and effort are needed today; let us waste no more time and leave no regrets for the future. May the Chinese people bear this in mind!</p>
<p>Urgent Telegrams</p>
<p>The Day After Japan Signed a Treaty with the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Our Country Lodges a Strong Protest</p>
<p>The Protest Points Out Seven Major Responsibilities Japan Should Bear</p>
<p>A Note is Sent to Twelve Nations Asking Them to Adopt Effective Response Methods</p>
<p>Full Text of the Protest</p>
<p>Telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Envoy Jiang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After receiving news on the afternoon of the 15th that Japan had formally recognized the puppet organization and signed the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs drafted a protest note that evening and telegraphed the full text to Envoy Jiang in Tokyo, instructing him to lodge it with the Japanese government. The protest note reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Since the evening of September 18th last year, when Japanese troops suddenly bombarded Shenyang according to a pre-determined plan, the Japanese government has been proceeding step by step, causing the situation in the three northeastern provinces to become increasingly serious. Not only has Chinese sovereignty been subjected to extreme trampling, but the sacred principles of international treaties have also been fundamentally shaken, and world peace has suffered a grievous blow. The resolution of the Council of the League of Nations on September 30th last year urged the Japanese government to refrain from further exacerbating the situation and to withdraw its troops to the railway zone in the occupied areas of Liaoning and Jilin provinces. The Japanese government itself also acknowledged this resolution. However, immediately after the Council's resolution was passed, Japanese troops expanded their actions, occupying the land of the northeastern provinces, including Qiqihar and other important cities in Heilongjiang Province. In November, disturbances broke out in Tianjin, which personnel in the Japanese concession in Tianjin were actually responsible for causing. On December 10th last year, with Japan's consent, the Council of the League of Nations reiterated its admonition against further expanding the situation and resolved that Japanese troops should withdraw to the railway zone as soon as possible. The Japanese government responded to this resolution with even more aggressive activities, the scope of which was not limited to the three northeastern provinces but extended to areas far from the place where the disturbances originated. Jinzhou, Harbin, and other military strongholds in the Northeast were all subjected to bombardment by Japanese troops, ultimately leading to their seizure. At the end of January this year, fierce military actions broke out in Shanghai, with Japanese naval landing forces taking the lead. Japan even dispatched several divisions of ground troops, resulting in countless losses of life and property. Having seized the entirety of the three northeastern provinces by force, Japan then engaged in the creation of a puppet organization, calling it Manchukuo and making Puyi its head, while all real power was controlled by officials responsible to the Tokyo government. Thenceforth, the seizure of our railways, the interception of our customs and salt revenues, and other taxes, the disruption of our postal service, the slaughter and oppression of our people, the wanton destruction of our property, and all other illegal actions were carried out in the name of Manchukuo, but in reality, they were directed by personnel loyal to or controlled by the Japanese government. The Chinese government has lodged strong protests with Japan for every act of aggression in China, drawing attention to the serious responsibilities it bears. However, Japan has not only ignored such protests but has responded with even more aggressive actions. Countries around the world have repeatedly warned against its policy of expanding its territory through violence. At the beginning of January this year, the United States government formally declared, 'The United States cannot recognize any situation de facto as legal, nor does it intend to recognize any treaty or agreement entered into between those governments, or agents thereof, which may impair the treaty rights of the United State or its citizens in China, including those which relate to the sovereignty, the independence, or the territorial and administrative integrity of the Republic of China, or the international policy relative to China, commonly known as the open door policy; and that it does not intend to recognize any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants and obligations of the Pact of Paris of August 27, 1928.' On February 16th, the declaration of the twelve representatives of the Council of the League of Nations stated, 'No member of the League should recognize any situation brought about by means contrary to the Covenant of the League of Nations.' On March 11th, the General Assembly of the League of Nations unanimously resolved, 'It is contrary to the spirit of the Covenant that the settlement of the Sino-Japanese dispute should be sought under the stress of military pressure on the part of either party.' Disregarding the friendly advice and warnings of other nations, disregarding the resolutions and admonitions of the League of Nations, and disregarding the common opinion of mankind, the Japanese government has now brazenly given formal recognition to the puppet organization produced by its militarism and concluded a so-called treaty with it, granting Japan the right to station troops in the eastern provinces, seeking to reduce the three northeastern provinces to the status of a Japanese protectorate. The League of Nations, in accordance with the resolution passed by the Council on December 10th last year and accepted by Japan, appointed a commission of inquiry, which is currently working with the assistance of representatives of the Japanese government. Now, just as the commission's work is nearing completion and before the League of Nations has had a chance to discuss it, Japan has hastily recognized the puppet organization. This action serves to increase its culpability and amounts to an insulting challenge to the authority of the League of Nations, as if the League's judgment would not be based on truth and fairness. Japan's brazen implementation of its violent, brutal, and aggressive policy of conquest bears a weighty responsibility, rarely equaled in the history of modern international relations. The most obvious aspects of this responsibility are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan has violated the basic principles of international law, having undermined the territorial integrity of the Republic of China and usurped China's political and administrative power.</p>
<p>(2) Japan has violated the preliminary principles of law and the concept of humanity, having killed and wounded countless Chinese lives and destroyed public and private property in China, the total value of which is currently difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>(3) Japan has violated the Covenant of the League of Nations, in which each member state undertakes to respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of all member states of the League against external aggression.</p>
<p>(4) Japan has violated the Pact of Paris, in which each contracting state solemnly declares that it renounces war as an instrument of national policy in its relations with any other high contracting party and agrees that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means.</p>
<p>(5) Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty signed in 1922, in which each signatory state, except China, agreed to respect the sovereignty, independence, and the territorial and administrative integrity of China.</p>
<p>(6) Japan has violated its own pledges, having stated that it had no territorial ambitions in the eastern provinces and promising to withdraw Japanese troops to the railway zone as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(7) Japan has violated the repeated admonitions of the League of Nations, which has repeatedly warned Japan not to further expand or worsen the situation created by its aggression against China. For all the acts of aggression committed by Japan from the bombardment of Shenyang on September 18th last year to the recognition of the puppet organization on September 15th this year, and for any consequences arising therefrom, the Chinese government holds the Japanese government fully responsible. The Chinese government also reserves its rights under international law and treaties in the current situation. (Special dispatch, 16th)"</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>A Note to Twelve Countries</p>
<p>Japan's Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>Is Like "Adding the Most Venomous Ring</p>
<p>to the Chain of Criminal Acts"</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The note from our country to the contracting parties of the Nine-Power Treaty was prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 16th and sent out. The contracting countries are the eight countries of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Canada, as well as Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Mexico, and Bolivia, totaling twelve countries. The wording of the note is completely identical, drawing the attention of the governments of those countries and, in accordance with Article 1 of the treaty, requesting them to take appropriate and effective measures. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"On September 15, 1932, Japan actually implemented the recognition of the so-called Manchukuo, and announced in the so-called Japan-Manchukuo agreement that Japan has the right to station troops in the eastern provinces, the purpose of which is to subjugate the three eastern provinces to the position of a Japanese protectorate. The so-called Manchukuo is a puppet organization that was created, directed, and controlled by Japan within the territory of China's three eastern provinces. For a year, Japan has committed all kinds of international crimes, one after another, not only plundering China's sovereignty, but also violating the most important international treaties, including the Nine-Power Treaty signed in Washington in 1922, of which your country is also a signatory state. Now Japan's recognition of the puppet state is like adding the most poisonous ring to the chain of its criminal acts. The Chinese government must urge your government to pay close attention to the serious situation caused by Japan's recognition of Manchukuo. How Japan began its occupation of our three eastern provinces on the evening of September 18, how it wielded its iron fist to oppress our 30 million compatriots, and how it usurped our political power by creating a puppet organization are all facts known to the world and need not be repeated. What we want to summarize in a word is that since September 18, Japan has expanded its violence every day, to the point that it has taken the act of recognizing the puppet state today, which Japan still wants to deceive the world by saying that the so-called Manchukuo is the result of the people of the eastern provinces seeking separation, but it is not known that the Northeast puppet organization is a product of Japanese military aggression, and is used as a tool. It is an undisguised fact that the majority of Japanese officials are dispatched by the order of the Tokyo government, directing and controlling the puppet organization. The true Northeast people are moaning under the iron hooves of the Japanese army. If the Japanese army withdraws for a day, the collapse of the so-called Manchukuo can be expected immediately. Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that the contracting countries, except China, should respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China. Japan's creation and recognition of a puppet state, as well as its various acts of aggression against the Northeast, directly infringe upon China's sovereignty and seriously damage China's territorial and administrative integrity, which is beyond any doubt. The conclusion of the Nine-Power Treaty at that time was to prevent such events from happening. Now Japan is not only carrying out aggression against China, but also wantonly despising world public opinion and disregarding its sacred obligations to other countries. If Japan's actions are not subject to appropriate sanctions, and the contracting parties of the Nine-Power Treaty sit idly by and watch the treaty become a waste of paper, the consequences will be unbearable to speak of. Whether other international treaties will continue to maintain their sacred inviolability depends on this. Japan has used force to seize about 400,000 square miles of Chinese territory, and has formally recognized the illegal organization it has created in that area, regardless of the advice of friendly countries. The tragic consequences are not limited to China, but also pose an ominous threat to world peace. In view of the above situation, the Chinese government believes that a serious situation has already occurred, involving the application of the Nine-Power Treaty, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the treaty, with full frankness, it informs the governments of the contracting parties of the Nine-Power Treaty and requests them to take appropriate and effective measures to deal with the situation caused by all the acts of aggression committed by Japan, from the bombardment of Shenyang on September 18 last year to the formal recognition of Manchukuo on September 15 this year."</p>
<p>Japan Recognizes the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notifies the League of Nations</p>
<p>Instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issued the Night Before</p>
<p>Listing Japan's Aggressive and Violent Acts</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Japan implemented the recognition of the puppet organization on the 15th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed instructions to Geneva that evening, ordering our country's representative to immediately send a note to the League of Nations. The gist of the instructions is as follows: (1) Since September 18, Japan has continued to implement its policy of violence, brutality, and conquest, with the sole purpose of expanding its territory. Its various acts of violence have become increasingly severe, and today it has formally recognized the puppet organization. The Japanese government's recognition of the puppet organization is in fact a confession and admission of responsibility for all the acts of aggression against China's territorial integrity in the three eastern provinces. Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations clearly stipulates that the territorial integrity of all member states should be respected and preserved. (2) The puppet organization is purely a product of Japanese manufacture and manipulation. All real power is in the hands of the Japanese. Japan's recognition of the puppet organization is tantamount to admitting its own acts of aggression. (3) The so-called agreement between Japan and the puppet organization is purely one-sided, and is only for the purpose of Japan fulfilling its ambition to build a protectorate in the three eastern provinces. (4) According to the protocol signed between Japan and the "puppet" organization, Japan has the right to assume the defense of the puppet organization. In the future, Japan's implementation of this provision poses a grave threat to China and the world. (5) Since the Sino-Japanese dispute was submitted to the League of Nations, all parties have been waiting for a solution. Now that the report of the Commission of Inquiry has not yet been disclosed, and the League of Nations has repeatedly warned against aggravating the situation, Japan has brazenly disregarded this and insisted on going its own way, creating and recognizing a puppet organization, and its contempt for the authority of the League of Nations has reached its extreme. Under the above circumstances, the League of Nations should be requested to step up its work and take the most effective measures to deal with the current situation.

<p>The United States Maintains a Policy of Observation</p>
<p>Stimson Says Empty Words are of No Help</p>
<p>(Washington) Stimson and other officials of the State Department are still taking an attitude of observation without commenting on Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo (puppet state)". The Tribune said that the general view in officialdom is that the Nine-Power Pact has indeed been broken by Japan, but Washington will only adopt a policy of diplomatic non-recognition of "Manchukuo (puppet state)" until there is action in Geneva. The public believes that the State Department sympathizes with China's claim that the "Manchukuo" case is within the scope of the Hoover Doctrine, but hopes that the Lytton Report can provide a basis for negotiating with Japan to resolve the matter. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, when meeting with reporters today, declined to comment on Japan's recognition of the Manchu puppet organization, saying that empty words are of no help at this time, and all substantive actions will be finally decided in conjunction with other relevant countries. Regarding the rumors from Paris that the signatories of the Nine-Power Pact will meet to determine whether Japan has violated the treaty, Stimson also declined to confirm, and solemnly stated that all matters are awaiting the publication of the League of Nations' investigation report.

<p>Newspapers of Various Countries</p>
<p>Comment on France's Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government has not yet received official notification of Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" and China's protest to Japan. France does not want to take unilateral action, but is willing to maintain close contact with Britain, the United States, and the League of Nations. It must understand the Lytton Report before it can express its opinion. Most French newspapers are silent, as is the official attitude. However, the Paris Times made some comments on this recent development, predicting that unpleasant unexpected events will occur in the Far East, and said that if the parties concerned had the slightest courtesy, they should wait for the Lytton Report and the League of Nations' resolution on the report before taking action. The Paris Times hopes that Japan will not withdraw from the League of Nations, because this move will only transfer the problem from the League of Nations to the signatories of the Nine-Power Pact, which is something that everyone wants to avoid. It is hoped that Tokyo will carefully consider what is permissible to protect legitimate interests and what is prohibited by international cooperation and the rights within the scope of the Convention of Dignity. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times published an editorial entitled "Japan and the Manchuria Problem", which stated, "We have known since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese conflict that it would have serious consequences. It is said that the conflict between the two countries was originally a local one, and it may not have been possible to end it if the Chinese and Japanese authorities had compromised. Although this method of resolution is open to discussion, the League of Nations has taken it over legally and has sent a commission of inquiry to investigate the situation on the ground. The two parties concerned should wait for the formal publication of the commission's report before taking any new actions that would fundamentally change the relationship between China and Japan. This is the right attitude. It is clear that Manchuria, with the assistance of Tokyo, declared its secession from Chinese protection and formed an independent state, which is legally debatable. However, it is a completely different situation when the new country has not yet been recognized by the great powers and Japan has hastily concluded an alliance treaty with it. Even if the alliance treaty is defensive in nature, it does not detract from Japan's acquisition of new military privileges and the inclusion of Manchurian territory. In fact, this move breaks the two principles of equality of rights for the great powers in the Far East and maintaining the political status quo. If this kind of treaty is signed before the problem accepted by the League of Nations is legally resolved, it is difficult to reconcile with the existing compromises and treaties. Therefore, the Tokyo government has placed itself in a difficult position with the League of Nations. Recently, some sources have said that Japan may withdraw from the League of Nations. From a rational and prudent point of view, this kind of difficult fact should not be allowed to turn into an irreversible situation. The changes in the future are difficult to predict in terms of the direct repercussions of this matter on the international situation. Japan is a great power, its politics have reached a mature stage, and it can understand the moral responsibility for maintaining peace. However, because of this, Japan should think twice before acting. In the name of its legitimate interests, how far can Japan go? Japan should respect the law in international cooperation and abide by the treaties signed in good faith. What kind of behavior is contrary to these two obligations and should not be done by Japan? The Tokyo government has a responsibility to carefully consider all of these issues. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers criticized Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" with cautious and prudent wording. Public opinion generally believes that this move is unreasonable. The Paris Daily News said that even if Japan has unquestionable interests in the three eastern provinces, it is not allowed to make this gesture, which is not conducive to the situation in the Far East. The L'Ere Nouvelle commented that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" is a direct harm to the United States and Russia, and is a violation of the Nine-Power Pact, which may lead to serious consequences. The People's News stated that the terms of the Japan-Manchukuo Agreement are tantamount to military annexation. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>England (London) The Manchester Guardian stated, "Regardless of Japan's excuses, Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" is simply tearing China's limbs apart and using violence. Although this violence is war, Japan does not call it war. Japan has now broken the treaty signed between China and Japan. Japan's behavior is an attack on the entire international order. Since the European War, we have always wanted to maintain this order in the West and the East." (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) A Times editorial stated that other governments are unlikely to follow Japan's lead in recognizing "Manchukuo". The various interests of the Japanese in the three eastern provinces have been stabilized by the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. Japan has achieved this result by using pre-European War political tactics. However, it is undeniable that its opposition to the principles of the League of Nations Charter, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and other treaties signed by Japan. The newspaper also commented on Japan's statement in its declaration that it would open the interior of Manchukuo to foreigners, saying that the feelings of the British people about this statement are not as profound as the feelings caused by the kidnapping of the British in Niuzhuang. The British do not want to enter the interior, but are still kidnapped by bandits. Travelers on the railway are still subject to harm from time to time. It would be better to ban travel. Japan's policy towards Manchuria is indeed not considerate of its obligations. This has long been criticized by U.S. Secretary of State Stimson and the League of Nations' resolution. However, it would be a mistake to insult Japan before the Lytton Report exposes the various facts. Great Britain has rarely supported Japan's actions in Shanghai in the past, but the position of the Japanese in Manchuria is very different from that in Shanghai and cannot be generalized. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Germany (Berlin) Japan's official recognition of "Manchukuo" has been expected for a long time due to publicity, so it has not caused much surprise. Officials here say that Germany's political interests in the Far East are not in danger. As far as business relations are concerned, Japan has repeatedly said that it will open its doors. The German government representative stationed in the Far East has not reported that Japan has changed its views. German newspapers attach great importance to the signing of the Japan-Manchu treaty and China's protests, but most of them do not comment on this new development. Only the royalist newspaper Kreuzzeitung said that Sino-Japanese relations may become more tense and lead to an undeclared state of war. It is hoped that Russia and the United States will take this opportunity to abandon their attitude of indifference. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Japan and the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Conclude a Military Agreement</p>
<p>Headquarters of the Kwantung Army Move to Changchun</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It was learned today that the military agreement concluded between Japan and the army authorities of "Manchukuo" was based on the provisions of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. Its contents have not yet been disclosed by the authorities. According to a government spokesman, this is purely an arrangement between the military authorities of both sides and does not bind the government. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, which recognized the puppet state of Manchukuo, stipulates that Japanese troops will be stationed in Manchukuo. However, due to financial reasons, the Kwantung Army does not intend to immediately change the deployment of its troops. However, the headquarters of the Kwantung Army will still move to Changchun in November in accordance with the established policy. The policy of national defense and security for the puppet state of Manchukuo in the future was stated by Army Minister Araki at the special Diet session that the area guarded by the Japanese army is several times larger than before. However, due to the small number of troops, the main policy will be to guard the railway lines and strengthen security. (Japan News dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan-Manchu trade reciprocity treaty is the basic condition for the Japan-Manchu economic union. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Manchuria has just been recognized, and there is no need to conclude a new treaty immediately. The temporary measures will be based on the Sino-Japanese trade treaty, and then wait for the opportunity to conclude a treaty. (Tokyo Telegraph Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Declares Customs Independence</p>
<p>The Dalian Customs Office Changes to the Puppet State Flag</p>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo" government issued the following statement today, which was telegraphed to the League of Nations Secretariat and the governments of various countries. The statement said, "The Manchukuo government will regard the Republic of China as a foreign country in the future with regard to customs duties and trade and navigation relations. The following will be implemented after September 25: (1) Goods transported from "Manchukuo" to the Republic of China by land or sea will be subject to export tax at the current tax rate, and imports will be subject to import tax. (2) Regarding the imposition of tonnage tax, the tonnage tax payment certificates issued by the Chinese government will not be recognized by "Manchukuo". (3) The right to navigate inland waters between the ports of Manchukuo and the ports of China will not be recognized. The permits to navigate inland waters issued by the Chinese government will not be recognized by the "Manchukuo" government. (4) In order to implement the above items, customs will be set up in Shanhaiguan and other places to start collecting taxes. (Tokyo Telegraph Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Dalian Customs Tax Collection Office was renamed the "Manchukuo" Dalian Customs yesterday. The puppet Minister of Taxation sent a telegram to the Customs Chief Fukumoto, appointing him and ordering him to replace the Manchukuo flag yesterday afternoon. (Tokyo Telegraph Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo" government issued a statement yesterday afternoon regarding the payment of foreign debts guaranteed by customs revenue, which said,</p>
<p>"The Manchukuo government, in accordance with the spirit of respecting all national agreements of the Republic of China, limited to those applicable to "Manchukuo", will send banknotes totaling 1,140,001 yuan to the Shanghai General Taxation Department as part of the burden of domestic and foreign debts of customs revenue. The 186,003 yuan detained by the Niuzhuang Yokohama Specie Bank will be accepted by the Nanjing government to pay off foreign debts, but only for this time. In the future, "Manchukuo" will bear the burden and remit it to the General Taxation Department. However, the "Manchukuo" government reserves the right to make a precise calculation of this amount when the guarantee burden of "Manchukuo" 's foreign debt is determined.

<p>Recent Situation of the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>(Beijing) A person from Changchun said that the puppet regent Puyi only has an empty name, and all power is in the hands of the Japanese commander. The former commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Shigeru Honjo, was arrogant in everything, which Puyi was dissatisfied with. In order to appease Puyi, the Japanese government replaced Honjo. When Muto arrived, he first sent someone to Changchun to express his intention to abolish the General Affairs Office, and sought Puyi's opinion. Puyi agreed to maintain it for one year. Puyi's monthly salary and stamp fee are 80,000 yuan. Puyi's residence is guarded by four Japanese attendants and military officers in rotation, and his diet and daily life are restricted. Zheng Xiaoxu and Xie Jieshi are extremely respectful to the Japanese. The Japanese are quite suspicious of Zhao Xinbo and Xi Qia. Zhao and Xi's residences are monitored by the Japanese. When a member of the investigation team saw Puyi, he asked if he was safe here. Puyi blushed and could not answer. Puyi sits in a city of sorrow every day, and tells everyone that he cannot do it and always wants to get away from this place. Puyi's face is thin and extremely unnatural.

<p>U.S.-Russia Espionage</p>
<p>Secrets of Japanese Industrial Mobilization</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, recently, in various factories such as aircraft, engines, and machinery throughout the country, due to the reliance on U.S.-Russia relations, foreigners often sneak into the inland to secretly detect the secrets of the Empire's industrial mobilization. Those who secretly fly around continue to appear. Although the army authorities have strictly cracked down, foreigners use huge amounts of money, and Japanese citizens are induced by profit, and it is inevitable that acts of treason are discovered. The government is vigorously pursuing countermeasures for the lack of national awareness. In addition, it is reported that Mr. Harde, the vice president of the National Bank of New York, accompanied by his secretary, Mr. Gads Ross, came to Beijing last month under the guise of investigating banking business, and their actions were quite erratic. They received instructions from the New York head office and sent telegrams to the general affairs departments of various branches in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, etc., ordering them to take photos of important public and private buildings in important cities in the Japanese mainland and in Dalian, Harbin, and other places in Manchuria. Although this matter was reported by the Military Police Headquarters and strictly cracked down, the heads of each bank strongly defended themselves to the Metropolitan Police Department, the Army Ministry, and the Military Police Corps, and ordered the authorities to correct it in the newspaper. However, the Japanese authorities' attitude was unusually tough, and they still pointed out that the photos taken were completely of important buildings for urban air defense and had a great relationship with military affairs. According to the selected important buildings to be photographed this time, there are (1) 30 locations in Kobe, (2) 59 locations in Osaka, and the details of Tokyo, Kyoto, and other cities are still unknown.</p>

<p>Asahi Aircraft Missing</p>
<p>Carrying Photos of the Traitorous Treaty with Japan</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 16th - The Asahi Shimbun's aircraft "Asahi," departed from Changchun at 11:10 yesterday morning, carrying various documentary films of the traitorous treaty signed with Japan, and took the route to Japan via Korea.

<p>German Foreign Minister Broadcasts Speech</p>
<p>Reiterating Armament Demands</p>
<p>Meeting of the Technical Committee on Disarmament</p>
<p>Germany, the United States, and Russia Did Not Send Representatives to Attend</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 16th - German Foreign Minister Neurath made a speech on wireless radio last night, stating the reasons why Germany sent a letter to the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, declaring that it could not attend temporarily. He briefly stated that unilateral reduction of armaments would lower Germany's status, be discriminated against, and put the country in extreme danger of insecurity. According to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany's reduction of armaments was the beginning of universal disarmament throughout the world. After a long period of preparation, the World Armaments Conference began in February this year. At that time, the whole world held great hopes for the conference, but its results were absolutely unsatisfactory, which disappointed the world. Germans are naturally even more disappointed. Therefore, before the fundamental issue of Germany's equal rights is resolved, Germany can no longer cooperate. Germany still recognizes that effective universal disarmament is an urgent plan to maintain world peace, but if other countries refuse to fulfill their universal disarmament obligations, Germany can no longer tolerate the severe restrictions imposed on freedom of armament. The security and defense rights required by other countries must also apply to Germany. The government knows this well and should have the backing of the whole country.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 15th - The Technical Committee of the Disarmament Conference reconvened today. Germany, the United States, and Russia did not send representatives to attend. The absence of the U.S. representative was reportedly due to Congress's severe cuts in the U.S. delegation's expenses. Russia has notified the secretariat of the conference that the acting Foreign Minister of Russia, Litvinov, will attend the meeting of the Executive Committee on September 21. As for the meetings of other committees and subcommittees, it is planned not to send representatives to attend again. The German government reportedly sent a letter to Henderson, the chairman of the conference, explaining that Germany could no longer participate in the Disarmament Conference before the issue of armament equality was resolved. The letter is expected to be published today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Amid Disarmament Calls</p>
<p>Countries Compete to Build Ships</p>
<p>Havas, London, 16th - A new submarine built by the Chatham Shipyard in the United Kingdom, which began construction in 1930, has now been completed. This submarine is the fifth submarine in the Dolphin fleet.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 15th - After the French Navy's latest destroyer, the "Maille-Brézé," was built, it was tested today. The speed reached 40 miles, the displacement was 2,480 tons, equipped with five 13.8cm guns, one 7.5cm gun, one 3.7cm anti-aircraft gun, seven torpedo tubes, and a crew of 250.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 16th - Germany will start building the third "Deutschland"-class pocket battleship at the Wilhelmshaven naval shipyard on October 1. According to the plan, the first batch of funds for the ship was approved in the last naval budget, but it was stipulated that the final decision should depend on the trend of the Disarmament Conference. Now the German government believes that the conference may not have practical results, so it has instructed the military authorities to start construction, which is expected to be completed in 1936.</p>
<p>Franco-Polish Military Alliance Treaty</p>
<p>Remains in Effect for Another Ten Years</p>
<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 16th - The Franco-Polish Military Alliance Treaty has been automatically extended for another ten years today because neither party made a declaration of unwillingness to continue today.

<p>German Speaker Accuses Papen</p>
<p>Preparing the Ground for Elections</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th - According to reliable sources, according to current law, the Parliamentary Investigation Committee has the same rights as ordinary courts and can summon citizens to attend the meeting as witnesses. However, if cabinet members are summoned this time, no one will attend the hearing. As for Göring's accusation of Papen's defamation, the public does not pay much attention to it, because the public is already tired of hearing about this kind of constitutional dispute, and they believe that Göring's purpose in doing this is only to find an opportunity to make several speeches and prepare the ground for future elections.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia Refuses Trotsky Entry</p>
<p>National News Agency, Prague, 15th - The Czechoslovak government previously allowed the famous Soviet official Trotsky to recuperate in Piestany, but now suddenly revoked the previous agreement, which greatly surprised everyone. The newspapers of the National Party tried their best to oppose allowing Trotsky to enter the country. Later, the Minister of Commerce, Mr. Matuschek, the representative of the National Democratic Party in the cabinet, requested that the previous agreement be revoked. Then the cabinet members of the Agrarian Party also followed suit, and the Minister of the Interior, Mr. Slavik, declared in the cabinet that if Trotsky lived in Piestany for a long time, he could not guarantee his safety. Therefore, the Foreign Minister had no choice but to send a telegram to the Czech consul in Istanbul, ordering him not to issue a passport. It is said that this decision may only be temporary.</p>
<p>Ottawa Agreement to Be Announced Next Month</p>
<p>Havas, London, 15th - The agreements signed between the United Kingdom and the various dominions in the Ottawa Conference have been kept secret. It is now scheduled to be announced in London from October 13.</p>
<p>The Netherlands Will Increase Tariff Barriers</p>
<p>National News Agency, The Hague, 15th - Many people in the Dutch political circles expect the government to greatly increase import taxes in the near future, some of which will be increased by half. The current general tax rate is 10%, and it is expected to increase to 15% at that time, which is necessary to balance the budget for the coming year.</p>

<p>Thousands of Meteors Will Fall With It</p>
<p>World News Agency, New York - A comet named "Tempel" has not been seen on Earth for 33 years. According to calculations by astronomers, this comet will reappear in November this year, and it will be most clearly visible in China and Japan. Regarding this appearance, it will be accompanied by a peculiar phenomenon, that is, at the same time, a large group of meteors will fly and fall on the Earth. The comet's closest approach to the ground is estimated to be on November 17 and 18. According to reports, the "Tempel" comet approached the Earth in August 1898, and at that time, it could only be observed scientifically on the east coast of North America and a part of the Atlantic Ocean. This year, it can be clearly seen in Japan and China between 2:00 and 3:00 in the afternoon of November 17 and 18, and it can be seen without the help of a telescope. As for the visible meteors, there will be as many as 1,000 in 6 hours.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Bandit Suppression Army <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Continuously Capture Yingshan and Shangcheng</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence - The 47th Division of Shangguan Yunxiang and the 54th Division of Hao Mengling were ordered to advance towards Yingshan from Qiguang and other places in eastern Hubei. The area originally belonged to Anhui Province, but it was temporarily assigned to Hubei for the convenience of suppression. Shangguan's division captured Jiming River on the 12th and fought hard to recapture Fangjiazu, the second gateway to Yingshan, that night. Hao's division also set out from Yejia River in the rain and occupied important passes such as Ping'anling, Fenghuanggua, and Mengmengshan on the 13th, and joined Shangguan to advance. They then arrived near Yingshan County and seized the hills. The Red bandits resisted stubbornly. From morning to noon, the bandit forces did not stop and all retreated into the city. The artillery of the unit concentrated its firepower and first destroyed the important passes on the city. The vanguard troops then broke through the south gate under the cover of artillery fire and machine guns. The bandits could not defend and fled north in embarrassment from the Xihua River. The bandits at Jimingjian also withdrew from the Donghua River at the same time. The National Army completely captured Yingshan County at 3:00 pm that day. They searched for the remnants of the bandits, comforted the people, and dispatched left and right wings to follow up from Jinjiapu Yangliubian. Shangguan Yunxiang, the commander of the 47th Division, received the report at the Qishui military camp late at night and telegraphed Hankou to report the victory. The text said, "Our army completely occupied Yingshan at 2:00 pm today. The remnants of the false 5th Division and the independent 13th Regiment of the false guerrillas retreated in different directions towards Jinjiazai and Huoshan. Our army is pursuing and cleaning up at the same time. In this battle, hundreds of bandits were killed and many were captured. They are being cleared up. The bullet factory manufactured by the Yingshan Red bandits was also intercepted and destroyed." As for the central route, after the recapture of Xinji, most of the Red bandits entrenched in Shangcheng as their last bastion. Jinjiaji, not far from Shangcheng, was their most important defense line, stationed with the false 10th Division, the Shangcheng Independent Division, the Guangshan Independent Division, and other Red Guards, claiming tens of thousands of people. At 4:00 pm on the 13th, they fought fiercely with the central route of the National Army, the 2nd Column, at Qiligang Suishicun. The National Army detoured to its right wing and attacked the flanks from the side. The bandits suffered heavy losses and were all defeated. They retreated to the Yujiaji fortress. The National Army took advantage of the victory and advanced sharply, engaged in hand-to-hand combat and climbed the fortress one after another. They finally broke through and occupied Yujiaji at 7:00 pm. Another part also captured Gedian Sanliudian and went straight to Shangcheng. The place had deep trenches and high fortresses, making it even more difficult to attack. On the evening of the 13th, the 1st and 2nd Columns of the central route of the National Army marched lightly and urgently and launched a night attack on Shangcheng. The Red bandits were caught off guard and the 1st Column broke into the southwest city gate. The bandits, seeing that the strong city had been broken, scrambled to escape, trampling on each other, causing countless deaths and injuries. Many were killed by the National Army. A part of them broke out of the city and were also intercepted. Thousands of people were captured. The above is the area of the central route army in eastern Hubei and southern Henan. Now, it is only necessary to connect with the right-wing army and capture the bandit nest of Jinjiazai, and the bandit suppression military affairs on this route can be concluded. (September 14)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Harbin Flood Gradually Recedes <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Still Ignore the Disaster Situation Outside Daoli</p>
<p>Bao Guancheng and Zhang Jinghui Compete for Power</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police Humiliates the Chief Inspector to Death</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence - Since the great flood in this area, the weather has been rainy recently, but it clears up soon. The upstream mountain torrents have been washed away, and the river water has fallen slightly. Since the flood, the water level has dropped by about 57 centimeters. The Flood Disaster Extraordinary Committee organized by the puppet government in Daoli has ordered the manufacture of ten drainage machines. Since the installation and implementation of drainage, the accumulated water in the city streets has been decreasing day by day. The southern end of Central Avenue and Xincheng Avenue is still not completely drained due to low-lying areas, but the water level has been reduced to about a foot. The water depth in the artillery team and Zhengyang River partial warehouses is still three or four feet or more. It will take about half a month to completely drain. Although the accumulated water outside Daoli has dropped since the river water receded, it has only decreased by one foot and five or six inches so far. East of Wuliu and Liuliu Streets, the water depth is still submerged. Merchants and gentry outside Daoli have repeatedly urged the puppet water committee to drain the water and relieve the market. Until recently, there was a proposal to start on September 20 and drain the water by October 20. However, the number of drainage machines needs to be increased to 21 to be effective within 30 days. In addition to the Chamber of Commerce trying to raise funds, the puppet water committee is rushing to manufacture them. Before the implementation of the drainage work, sandbags and wooden stakes were used to block a section of the embankment that collapsed on the Jiangdi 90th Street. This matter started on September 1. Four rows of sandbags were piled up to form an arc, and wooden stakes were nailed outside to prevent the water from washing them away. It is estimated that it will take four days to complete. The river water is currently about half a foot below the brick dam. The puppet water committee plans to wait until the water drops to 20 centimeters below the dam before draining the water. According to the Chamber of Commerce and various public groups, it is proposed to ask various ships to help by using the pumps on each ship to help drain the water. It can be drained mostly in about a week. The puppet water committee does not allow it, saying that the drainage plan is determined by the committee and other parties may not change it. The Chamber of Commerce and other groups painfully watched the losses and did not dare to argue. Later, it was learned that the acting chairman of the puppet water committee, Hirata (Hirata, the chief advisor to the puppet chief official's office and the municipal preparation office), colluded with Russian engineers and secretly accepted bribes, ordering the Russians to handle the matter. At the same time, the Japanese were gloating over the disaster of the Chinese. Therefore, although tens of millions of merchants outside Daoli were in the midst of the flood, Hirata never cared about it. Bao Guancheng, the puppet mayor, also served as the chairman of the puppet construction propaganda committee. Recently, he has been corrupting the organization of Greater Harbin and competing with Zhang Jinghui, the chief executive of the puppet special zone, for power. The undercurrent is very strong. Because the flood flooded Harbin, Zhang Jinghui complained to the Japanese that Bao was fond of doing good deeds and vying for credit, and the authority was not unified by him, which caused an unprecedented disaster. The Japanese believed it and transferred Bao to serve as a representative stationed in Japan, which was a clear promotion but a secret demotion. His vacancy was filled by Lu Ronghuan, who could take over around the 15th. Bao wanted to resign and not go because he was appointed to be a representative in Japan, which was a job that suffered the most. The Japanese did not allow it, so he complained a lot behind his back, saying that working with the Japanese was like living with tigers and wolves and could not predict when their beastly nature would erupt. Lu Ronghuan was the superintendent of the Eastern Railway who caused the Middle-Eastern Railway Incident in 1929. This gangster retired and lived at home and did not deeply conceal himself. After the establishment of the puppet country, he tried his best to run around. At first, he sought the superintendent of the Middle-Eastern Railway, but he opposed it. Later, he tried hard to get the mayor of Harbin, and now he has got his wish.</p>
<p>In this great flood, one person sacrificed, and the narration is quite pitiful. It can also be a warning to the great husbands of the subjugated country. The chief inspector of the Binjiang puppet public security bureau, Liu Zhao, ordered the police to patrol in shifts every day after the flood entered the city. He did not dare to slack off day and night. His achievements in the local area cannot be denied because he was an official of the subjugated country. Unexpectedly, at the end of July, because a certain inspector under his command was absent from duty, a Japanese military police sergeant, Maeda, slapped his face in public, and went to the flooded market barefooted to wade in the water to explore the depth. Liu was slightly distant, and Maeda beat him up in the street. At that time, there were many onlookers. Liu was seriously injured by the beating. After returning home, he became ill due to anger, and lingered for more than 20 days before dying. After his death, the Japanese military police forbade the coffin from being placed in the house and forced it to be buried quickly. His family had no choice but to bury him hastily. Liu had been the section chief and chief inspector of the public security bureau for nearly eight years and had never made a mistake. Unexpectedly, because he was demoted to an official of the puppet country, he was humiliated to death by a small soldier. It is also sad. (September 7)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Anhui Tea Merchants Oppose <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxi Levies Throughput Production and Sales Tax on Anhui Tea</p>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence - Yangzhuang red and green box tea of Huizhou is the largest export of Anhui Province. In recent years, in order to take care of the difficulties of tea merchants and promote the development of foreign trade of Chinese tea, the government has completely exempted the Lishui tax on exported box tea. The reason why Chinese tea does not disappear from the European and American markets is half dependent on this relief. This year, the Anhui Provincial Government has set up a special tea tax in various tea-producing counties. The tax rate on box tea has been changed to 20% of the value. After the opposition of all tea merchants, it was changed back to the 19th-year case, collecting 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 fen and 5 li per 100 catties of lead. Tea merchants believe that the restoration of the previous lead system will stop the opposition. Last month, thousands of boxes of box tea from Wuyuan's various terminal gangs were transported through Xiangtan, Dexing. The Jingwei team there suddenly blocked the box tea, drawing 8 jiao per box, because the Qingxiang funds were insufficient. Tea merchants refused to pay this illegal and harsh tax, which almost caused a great disturbance. Recently, the Hukou Investigation Office of the Jiujiang Collection Bureau of Special Products Production and Sales in Jiangxi Province has also forcibly collected production and sales taxes on box tea passing through Wuyuan, collecting 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 fen and 5 li per 100 catties according to the lead system. The tea house tea guests all said that this box tea is produced in Anhui Province. The Anhui Finance Department has stopped the lead tax on the finished case. Now, after passing through Jiangxi, this donation is levied again, which is difficult to accept. The office pointed out that tea merchants resisted the donation and blocked more than 3,000 boxes of tea from various houses, and ordered the additional payment of lead donations for box tea that had been registered before. The tea merchants had no choice but to send representatives to the Jiujiang Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association to request the general office to negotiate and release the tea. According to the report, the Xun Public Association believed that the office intended to make things difficult and sent representatives to the province to visit Director Hu of the General Office to request the cancellation of this donation and to state the suffering of tea merchants. Unexpectedly, Hu not only did not agree to the cancellation, but also pointed out that this Wuyuan box tea was produced in Dexing and must pay the donation according to regulations. The association had no choice but to telegraph the Shanghai Tea Industry Association, requesting the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to order the office to release the tea. After more than ten days, there was still no concrete solution. According to a letter from Jiujiang tea merchants yesterday, the bureau must forcibly collect this production and sales donation. The detained box tea has not been released. More than a thousand boxes of tea on the way are currently parked in Lizhou and are temporarily postponed for shipment. The two sides are in a stalemate, and it is difficult to solve it for a while. The tea industry association here believes that this illegal and harsh donation is unacceptable. Otherwise, tea exports must pass through Zhejiang and Jiangxi. If the counties follow the example of collecting donations, there will be no residue in the tea's blood. In addition to convening plenary meetings to discuss countermeasures, representatives are appointed to go to Beijing, Shanghai, Xunhan, requesting assistance from colleagues to resist until the goal is achieved.

<h3 id="e6">Jiangsu Province Business Tax <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Cannot Be Handled Entirely Like Zhejiang</p>
<p>Finance Department Approves the Chamber of Commerce Federation</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence - The Fifth Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation had a proposal to request the Finance Department to send personnel to cooperate with the Federation to investigate and imitate Zhejiang's handling of business tax rates. It is now learned that the Finance Department has approved it, stating briefly, "According to the previous report of the Federation, the results of regional guidance and the six opinions stated have been clearly instructed. The business tax law states that the business tax rate should be determined separately by each province and city based on the nature and situation of local businesses. That is to say, the nature and situation of each province are different. Even with regard to the most important tax rate, according to the principle of tax law, each province should examine the situation and determine it separately. There is no regulation that each province must be the same. In order to take care of the difficulties of merchants, this province will postpone the implementation of the original plan to collect 10 per mille, which has been approved by the Ministry of Finance, and refer to Zhejiang's method to temporarily set three tax rates of 5 per mille, 8 per mille and 10 per mille for separate collection. In addition, the project for merchants specializing in whole sales and wholesale is allowed to be temporarily collected at half price, which is already an excessive change and a compromise. In addition, the situations in each province are different, and it is difficult to combine the methods. The request to send personnel to investigate and imitate the entire handling should not be discussed. Now that the provincial treasury is empty and military expenses are urgent, the business tax funds in each county urgently need to be collected and used. It is difficult to postpone the investigation. The Federation should immediately telegraph the local chambers of commerce and inform the merchants to comply with the regulations as soon as possible. If they continue to wait and see on the pretext, it means that they intend to obstruct. The Ministry cannot tolerate it any longer. Please comply." (September 16)</p>

<p>Zhang Jingjiang and Li Shizeng Both Go to Meet and Talk</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Wang Zhaoming, Standing Committee Member of the Central Political Conference and President of the Executive Yuan, suffered a relapse of an old illness. He went from Nanjing to Shanghai for medical treatment. Although special envoys from the Central Government earnestly persuaded him to return to Nanjing for treatment, his condition worsened, and his fever increased. He was temporarily unable to return to Nanjing. On the 15th, he sent separate telegrams to Ye Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, and the Secretariat of the Central Political Conference, requesting an extension of his leave for two weeks and requesting that a member be entrusted to act as chairman during the meetings of the Central Political Conference, as was the custom. That night at 9:00 PM, he instructed the Railway Bureau to prepare a train, including two decorated cars and one baggage car, to depart from Shanghai's Fanwangdu to Hangzhou at 11:30 PM. In addition to Wang and his wife, Chen Bijun, there were also three secretaries and attendants. At 1:30 AM, the Hangzhou City Station received a telephone report from Shihudang Station near Fengjing, Jiashan, stating that Wang's special train had arrived at the station. The stationmaster temporarily ordered the railway police to drive away the coolies sleeping inside the station and ordered the city gates and iron gates to be closed to prevent idlers from entering or leaving. At that time, Central Committee members Chu Minyi and Zhang Fakui were waiting at the station. Newspaper reporters were also denied entry. Around 2:00 AM, the Sixth Sub-bureau of the First District received the news and sent a patrol officer to take care of the situation. The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau ordered a platoon of patrol cars to rush to the station for guard duty. He Yun, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Zhong Jixing, Captain of the Patrol Brigade, also arrived at the station to welcome him. It was not until 6:30 AM on the following day (the 16th) that Wang's special train arrived at Hangzhou Station. The police force saluted with their guns. After Wang got off the train, the welcomers had prepared a hired car for Wang and his wife to ride in. However, Wang's special train already had a car of his own, so he ordered the original car to return. Immediately, Wang and his wife, secretaries, attendants, Chu, Zhang, and others, seven people in total, split into two cars and drove to Mogan Mountain to rest without stopping. At 9:20 AM, they arrived at the foot of Mogan Mountain. The management bureau had prepared sedan chairs in advance to go up the mountain. They temporarily stayed in the June Rest Garden, the villa of Zhou Xiangling, a wealthy merchant in western Zhejiang. Prominent figures staying on the mountain, such as Zhang Jingjiang and Li Shizeng, all went to visit and talked for a long time. It is said that Wang will stay for several days to recuperate.

<p>County Hospital Opens a Morgue: The County-run Songjiang Hospital has undergone a major overhaul since appointing Dr. Zhang Shaoxiu as its director last month. The hospital wards and equipment have been newly added, and a large number of diagnostic and treatment instruments have been purchased. To facilitate childbirth, an obstetrician has been hired to oversee the obstetrics and gynecology department. The government subsidizes the regular expenses, still according to the original budget. The director has generously contributed his own funds to enrich the hospital's resources. However, the hospital still lacks a morgue, which has made it difficult to handle the aftermath of deaths. Therefore, he suggested to the authorities that this be brought up at the 21st Party-Government Meeting. It was decided that the county government should order the hospital to properly plan and set up a morgue. It is now known that the director has surveyed the buildings and estimated that the cost of installing doors and windows would be 67.30 yuan. After reporting back to the county government, the county government instructed the hospital and ordered the Finance Department to allocate 30 yuan from this year's reserve fund. The remaining shortfall will be made up by the hospital from savings in regular expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Wuxi <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Two District Chiefs Simultaneously Accused: Qian Zhongliang, the chief of the First District under the county, was recently accused by citizens Jiang, Quan, and Jinhong of being derelict in his duties, failing to publicize financial matters, and abusing his power. They submitted a petition to Sun's office, requesting that it be forwarded to the provincial government to remove him from office and appoint another competent official to manage local affairs. At the same time, citizens Deng Shuren and others from the Second District accused the district chief Zhang Guangdi of abandoning his war responsibilities and failing to publicize all public funds and income and expenditure accounts in the district for a long time, resulting in the failure to collect interest on treasury bonds. They jointly petitioned County Magistrate Chen to order an investigation and publicize the accounts in accordance with the law to protect public funds. Upon receiving the petitions, County Magistrate Chen has dispatched personnel to conduct thorough investigations in order to verify the facts and handle the matter accordingly.</p>
<p>New Trends in Opium Public Sales: The discussion of public opium sales has been rampant. However, the authorities believe that if they still wish to follow the previous case of establishing a smoking ban bureau and issuing licenses to smokers, it would easily provoke opposition from all parties. Currently, Jiangsu Province only allows the transport and sale of special goods from Hunan and Hubei, which is different from a complete lifting of the ban. Moreover, Jiangsu Province has not yet implemented public opium sales, so it still advocates the method of public transport and sale of domestic goods. The opinions put forward by the contractors in various counties have not been accepted. The contractors in various counties believe that this is similar to secret publicity and that the mixing of official and private goods will have a significant impact on transportation. As a result, they have all withdrawn their bids. Yin Xiangchen, the contractor from Wuxi, has returned to Wuxi from the province and has decided to give up on this special goods public sale. Those who were once rushing to bid are now disheartened and dare not ask about it. Jiangsu Province has fallen into a state of being无人问津, and in the future, the office responsible for the transport and sale of opium in Jiangsu Province, which is dispatched by the headquarters, will directly send personnel to transport and sell to various counties.</p>
<p>Change of Director of the Construction Bureau: Yao Dixing, the Director of the Construction Bureau of the county, was recently transferred to Yixing to replace Ge Ying, the Director of the Construction Bureau of Yixing, whose resignation was approved by the provincial government. Xiao Zicai (possibly Sicun) was appointed to act as the Director of the Construction Bureau of this county. The above order has already been issued. After receiving the order, Director Yao is currently rushing to hand over his duties. However, he has expressed his firm refusal to take up the post of Director of the Construction Bureau of Yixing. The newly appointed Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, Xiao Zicai, arrived in Wuxi from Zhenjiang by car yesterday (the 16th) with his entourage.

<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Thoroughly Investigates the Excessive Issuance of Cocoon Trays: Regarding this year's autumn cocoon prices, the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces previously convened silk cocoon leaders to discuss the standard cocoon price. It was agreed that 38 yuan would be the standard price. The autumn cocoon market in this county has been open for nearly ten days. However, due to the small amount of goods arriving, some cocoon traders have now closed their scales in order to avoid expenses. Silk manufacturers with better appetites are still excessively issuing cocoon trays and competing to purchase cocoons. Some slippery cocoon merchants with insufficient capital to turn around are also secretly issuing cocoon trays, offering five yuan per load according to the market price to lure cocoon farmers. This bad situation was learned by Tan Xihong and Zhong Kui, representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Nanjing. They sent a special telegram to the leaders of the silk cocoon industry in this county, Qian Fenghao and Hua Shaochun, requesting them to earnestly persuade their colleagues to maintain the provincial government's principle of standard cocoon prices and to investigate the initiator of the destruction for investigation. The original telegram stated: "To Qian Fenghao, Chairman of the Wuxi Silk Factory Association, and Hua Shaochun, Chairman of the Cocoon Industry Association: It has been reported that the cocoon price in Wuxi is being competitively raised to 60 yuan, which is extremely alarming. The government's relief of the silk industry originally aimed for the silk industry to work together to restore its original position. Currently, the silk market has slightly improved, but colleagues are deceiving each other and disregarding everything. This is tantamount to running counter to the government's intentions. We urge your association to earnestly persuade your colleagues to strive to maintain the provincial government's principle of standard cocoon prices and to investigate the initiator of the excessive issuance for investigation."</p>

<p>A Passenger on the Longda Steamer Was Beaten to Death by the Tea Room: On the 7th of this month, when the Longda Steamer of the Shanghai-Yangzhou Datong Company arrived at Ren Port, the ticket inspector found that a passenger, Mr. A, had not purchased a ticket. The passenger requested to be exempted from the ticket, but his request was rejected. He was beaten by the tea room, injuring his temple. He fell on the deck and died. The purser of the steamer immediately called several coolies to wrap his body in a straw mat and hide it next to the toilet. At midnight, they threw it into the river. Many passengers witnessed this, but they all sighed at the tragedy, thinking that it was none of their business.</p>

<p>The Provincial Department Orders Strict Pursuit of Handling Fees: Since the Provincial Department of Education sent five supervisors to Yangzhou to specially reorganize the education of Jiangdu, an embezzlement case of more than 15,000 yuan in handling fees was discovered in the financial layer. It is said that the amount should be shared equally by the education directors and cabinet secretaries who have served in the past five years. It is reported that the 7,000 yuan of the director's share has been collected separately by the cabinet secretaries and remitted to the county. As for the half that the cabinet secretaries themselves should return, they repeatedly requested the county magistrate to request the Provincial Department of Education to allow them to postpone the payment. County Magistrate Yang was afraid that the collection would be too urgent and would affect the current revenue of money and grain, so he reported the situation to the Provincial Department and asked for help. It is said that the Provincial Department of Education expressed deep dissatisfaction with the request for a temporary postponement. It immediately ordered the county government to still follow the previous orders and instruct them to pay within the specified time. If they set up excuses to disobey again, they will be escorted to the province for pressing.</p>

<p>Cancellation of the Examination of Party Training Teachers</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a notice to all colleges and universities above the specialized level regarding the cancellation of the examination of Party Ideology teachers and deans of student affairs in universities and colleges, stating: "The Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang's Office in Beijing approved a public letter No. 10236, stating: 'The Central Committee's 35th Standing Committee, according to a report from the Central Mass Movement Guidance Committee, stated that the examination of Party Ideology teachers and deans of student affairs in universities and colleges was originally intended to carefully select personnel to promote the development of Party Ideology education. Later, due to overly strict regulations, the examination was changed to a review, and it has not been successful for more than a year. Now that the Ministry of Education is studying the cancellation of the independent status of Party Ideology courses in colleges and universities above the specialized level in detail, it seems that there is no need to continue reviewing Party Ideology teachers and deans of student affairs in universities and colleges. Therefore, the 10th meeting decided to cancel the review of the qualifications of Party Ideology teachers in universities and colleges, and all documents and certificates of personnel requesting review stored by the Central Party Ideology Teacher Qualification Review Committee will be returned.

<p>Calling Principals of Primary and Secondary Schools for Talks</p>
<p>Reporting Three Matters</p>
<p>Since taking office, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, has been actively planning and promoting the city's education, sparing no effort. Yesterday, he specially called the principals of primary and secondary schools in the city for talks. Director Pan reported three matters, hoping that primary and secondary schools will pay attention to them: (1) Regarding the September 18th National Humiliation Memorial Day, the Ministry of Education has issued a clear order that schools should hold memorial meetings on that day to talk about the facts of national humiliation and arouse students' self-motivation. Avoid going out for parades to avoid accidents. (2) The failure of university education in the past was not due to a single reason, but the lack of strict training for students in secondary schools was the biggest reason. It is hoped that the principals of each school will adopt strict principles in training students to establish a foundation for university education. (3) Although the city's education funds are still fixed at 1.2 million per year, it is feared that they cannot be received in full due to the city's financial difficulties. It is hoped that each school will adopt a tight policy and save on various expenses to avoid being caught off guard when financial difficulties arise. Personally, I am deeply concerned about my downfall in assuming this position during this time of national crisis. If you have any suggestions, please let me know at any time, and I will adopt them sincerely.</p>

<p>Shen Siliang and Others Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Shen Talks About the International Impression of This Trip Is Very Good</p>
<p>Welcomed Everywhere, Regardless of Success or Failure</p>
<p>Song Junfu and Liu Changchun Head North This Morning</p>
<p>Shen Siliang (General Representative), Song Junfu (Coach), and Liu Changchun (Athlete), members of the Chinese delegation attending the 10th World Games, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:30 AM on the President Coolidge. They landed at the New Customs Wharf. Those who came to welcome them included relatives and friends of each person, as well as people from the sports and news circles. Mr. Shen had a lot of luggage, and the inspection took time. It was not until 11:00 AM that he left the port and went to the University of John. Song and Liu went to the Qingjian Association in Baxianqiao by car at 9:30 AM to stay. This morning at 9:30 AM, they took the Beijing-Shanghai train to Beijing and then took the Pingpu train north. Mr. Tuoping, director of the West Qing Sports Department, also came to Shanghai on the same ship. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Shen's Speech</p>
<p>Welcomed Everywhere: In the United States, in addition to the enthusiastic welcome from the Chinese community, the American people also showed goodwill to us everywhere, regardless of success or failure. Mr. Tuoping of the Shanghai Western Qingnian Association interacted with us every day to connect feelings. Therefore, although China's participation in this conference was small and there were no achievements, it did gain a sense of national sympathy and an excellent impression in the international community.</p>
<p>The Process of Attending the Conference: We left Shanghai on July 8 to participate in the 10th World Games, and arrived in Los Angeles late at night on the 29th. When we arrived at the pier, dozens of overseas Chinese stood to welcome us, which greatly increased our happiness. The next day, we went to the conference for the opening ceremony. On the second day of the conference, Mr. Liu Changchun began to compete. Although he did not win a medal, Mr. Liu's spirit of struggle is commendable, and he has gained a lot of experience. Therefore, it is only necessary to contribute personal experience and promote it. Conduct precise discussions in preparation for participating again in the future. I firmly believe that if the government and the people can cooperate, have a thorough understanding of this, vigorously promote it, make a final decision, and continuously carry it out, strive for universality, then it will not be difficult to compare with Europe and the United States in four years.</p>
<p>Results of the Conference: The conference closed on August 14. The United States won the first place with 41 medals, followed by Italy, France, and Sweden. We set off on the 21st and were able to meet with the compatriots in Shanghai today. He also said that all the experiences along the way to the United States have been repeatedly recorded in newspapers. There were no special incidents when returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>心怵目: When the ship arrived at Kobe, we did not go ashore. It is said that before Japan recognized the fake Manchuria, there were celebrations every day. There were slogans and publicity everywhere on the streets. All entertainment venues, etc., had signs with the words "September 18th National Day Celebration Day, free admission."</p>
<p>Liu's Speech</p>
<p>Feeling Very Sorry: The reporter went to the Youth Association at 3:00 PM to visit Mr. Liu Changchun. Here is a record of his speech: I (Liu calls himself below this imitation) went to the United States to participate in the 10th World Games. I did not prepare beforehand, so I did not achieve any results. I am ashamed of the country and hope that the people of the country will forgive me. At the same time, I hope to work hard and prepare for the next大会, which will be held in 1936. As for my participation this time, it was not dispatched by the government. All the travel expenses, a total of more than 8,000 yuan, were all provided by private individuals. Therefore, I only represent the people of China.</p>
<p>Safe Voyage: We set off from Los Angeles on August 21 and returned to the country on the President Coolidge from San Francisco on the 26th. Those traveling with us included Mr. Tuoping, the executive director of the sports department of the Shanghai Western Overseas Youth Association, and Tishang, etc. I still have to stay in the car for more than a month before I can return to the country. The voyage was very safe. The sea was calm and quiet all the way, without the suffering of颠簸.</p>
<p>American Welcome: When we were in the United States, the American people showed us a warm welcome everywhere and took great care of us. Even after I failed in the competition, they all came to shake hands, as if to express their regret for me. They were very cold to the Japanese players. Japan showed a mocking attitude everywhere. Even the spectators in the Games, when they saw Japanese players falling or failing, unanimously let out a kind of mocking sound. Only the Japanese players had thick skin and always tried their best to do it.</p>
<p>Heading North This Morning: Mr. Yu and Mr. Song (Junfu) were originally scheduled to go to Peiping on the 18th, but Mr. Song's home was suddenly looted by bandits, so they had no intention to stay any longer. They decided to take the early train from Shanghai to Beijing this morning and transfer to the Pingpu train to go north. All the entertainments in Shanghai were declined.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Closing Ceremony (Shen Siliang)</p>
<p>The grandness of the World Games closing ceremony matched the opening ceremony from start to finish. After two weeks of the world's gathering here, it temporarily came to an end. Everyone felt sorrow at the prospect of leaving such a solemn and stimulating event, and their emotions were clearly visible. Moved by the scene, each carried their own sorrow, even to the point of sobbing and weeping. Strong heroes displaying childlike emotions at this time and in this scene will be forever unforgettable to us.</p>
<p>Flag Ceremony After the final sporting event (equestrian jumping competition) in the stadium, all the equipment was removed. A 500-member military band and a 2,000-person choir entered the field and played again. Then, officials carrying national flags and the Olympic flag paraded in formation, similar to the opening ceremony. Because some athletes had already returned to their home countries, they did not participate. After the procession, the flags gathered in front of the podium, forming a semicircle called the "Flag Ceremony."</p>
<p>Speeches The closing ceremony included speeches by the following individuals. Their words were concise but very sincere: (1) Count de Balle Latour, President of the Olympic Committee; (2) Mayor Portor of Los Angeles; (3) Chairman Garland of the American Organizing Committee; (4) President of the German Amateur Sports Association (as the 11th Games were scheduled to be held in Germany).</p>
<p>Flag Presentation The organizing committee specially prepared an embroidered flag to be presented to the organizing committee of the host city as a gesture of gratitude and a symbol of honor. The flag was specially made and presented by the Mayor of Amsterdam, having been kept in the Amsterdam City Hall for four years. This time, the Mayor personally came to the Games to transfer the flag to the Mayor of Los Angeles, to be kept in the Los Angeles City Hall until the 1936 Games, when the flag will be sent to Berlin.</p>
<p>Cannon Fire When all stood in solemn silence until the end of the speeches, the Olympic emblem (interlocking rings of different colors) was lowered, and the torch that had been burning for sixteen days and nights was extinguished. At the same time, cannons fired and horns sounded. The flags of the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands were raised on the high tower, signifying the intent of these nations to host the 9th, 10th and 11th games.</p>
<p>Finale After the choir sang "Aloha - Till We Meet Again," the national flags and emblems were withdrawn from the grandstand, gradually disappearing from sight. The Olympic flag was carried by eight people to the center of the field, and as the song ended, the flag was rolled up, marking the end of the grand sporting event. (Reports from the Olympic Village and the press box will be published tomorrow.)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Financial Swap, Gold Market Momentum <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Shorts Post Up to Twelve Taels The price of gold suddenly soared yesterday. Coinciding with the gold exchange's scheduled swap day, business began an hour earlier at 8:00 AM, as per regulations. However, gold firms had already been trading outside the exchange in the early morning. The October-to-November swap was still posted by the shorts, initially at 6 taels and 5 mace, then 7 taels and 5 mace, with the lowest at 6 taels. When formally listed, it was 11 taels, as most longs were unwilling to swap lightly, while the shorts, being in the majority, were eager to swap in, causing the price to rise to 12 taels. It then rallied again, closing in the morning at 9 taels and 7 mace. Hengxing swapped long, while the shorts had already swapped properly. All October contracts were untraded. Opening volume was 729 taels, closing in the morning at 36.5 taels, up 14 taels and 8 mace from the 14th. This was due to the November listing being transferred. In the afternoon, the listing was canceled as usual, and most switched to trading November contracts.</p>
<p>November Contract Market Extremely Sharp The November contract was listed yesterday, and the situation was extremely sharp and the trend was smooth. It was particularly high at midday, with a difference of 10 taels between the morning and midday. However, the spread was only about 4 taels at most. Demand from fellow traders was very strong and bullish. The reason for the sharp rise was due to the large bullion price increase, American silver parity, and the fall in forwards and exchange rates, further exacerbated by the large swap. It was firm from the morning, mainly due to the tight foreign exchange situation, so progress was very rapid, continuing to rise by 10 taels. Later in the market, there was also a reversal of about 5 taels. Initially, it was strong and sharp, foreign exchange frequently contracted, and then it seemed to turn loose. As many longs sold off, the price fell sharply by more than 4 taels, finally closing between 724 taels, about 12 taels higher than before the closure (14th) (excluding the swap). Overall, bullion demand was still short. Here is a detailed account of the day's situation.</p>
<p>Morning Market Progresses Rapidly The November contract opened early at 718 taels, followed by 17 taels and 8 mace. The large bullion price had risen by one-quarter over the past two days, American silver rose and then fell, reaching parity, and silver futures repeatedly fell by 1.5 cents, so sentiment immediately rose. Shortly after, there was a 2 tael spread. At 8:30, buyers were active, with Qian Changxiang, Hengxing, Yuan Yifeng, Yongtong, Taichang, etc. all buying in, and the price rose by 4 taels. At 9:15, it was 22 taels and 3 mace, due to Yuan Kangxiang, Yuantai, Hengxing, and Yonglai selling and American dollars for October at 81.25 being available for settlement, and Zhongfu selling December at 31.0625, so at 9:30 it was 20 taels and 3 mace. HSBC listed English level American contracted 125, when the gold price was still level, around 21 taels. Hengxing sold out, retreating to around 20 taels. Then, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Yuanheng, Zhaofengchang, Zhifeng, and Yong bought in, and American dollars for December was doing 31 yuan, so the gold price rose by 3 taels until 10:15, when it was 23 taels and 5 mace. Later, because Huabi, etc. sold December at 31 yuan, Yuan Kangxiang, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Bingxing, etc. sold out, it ceded 2 taels. However, the up and down did not reach 1 tael until 11:00, when it was 21 taels and 5 mace. In the later market, the situation felt even sharper, and American dollars for December at 31 yuan could be sold to settle at .875, demand was very strong, and on the table, Xie Xing, Yong Richang, Yifeng, Yong Bingxing, Qian Changxiang, etc. were all buying in, a jump of three or four taels. It was particularly strong at 11:45, as it was known that the Prime Minister was expected to be reduced. Hengxing, Yuan Dadecheng, Fuyu, Hengyu, Fuchang, Yuanxing, Yong, etc. worked hard to buy in, so it was again stimulated by three taels all the way forward to 27 taels and 8 mace at 11:50. Then, Hengyu Zhaofengchang, etc. spat it out, and ceded 1 tael, and American dollars for December could be settled at .9375, until the market closed at 26 taels and 8 mace, and HSBC listed the fruit shrink 125, American dollars shrink 125, but did not take it as movement, it was already done early.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Sharpness Slightly Restrained The afternoon market opened at 26 taels and a half, followed by 8 taels and 1 mace, Yifeng Yong·Qian Changxiang sold out, and Huabi sold October American dollars at 30 and a half yuan, followed by zero households also selling out, so it was 26 taels and 7 mace. At the moment, Dadecheng, etc. bought in, and they knew that the Prime Minister had been reduced for the second time by 125, and the American dollars by 25, so they immediately added more than 1 tael, for 28 taels and 4 mace. After that, it was indeed hung shrunk, but it had already released its gas, and Yifeng Yong·Bingxing·Fuchang·Zhaofengchang were all out, HSBC came out with October American dollars at half a yuan, December at 75, at 2:30 for 26 taels and 6 mace. After entering, Mitsui absorbed January .875, and did half a yuan for October, Zhifeng Yong bought in, and added 1 tael, at 3:20 for 27 taels and 7 mace, but in these three quarters of an hour there were only a few cents up and down. In the subsequent market, Huabi HSBC sold November American dollars at .6875, especially Hengxing·Yifeng Yong·Yuanchun·Hengyu·Zhaofengchang·Dadecheng, etc. sold very hard, so the price plunged by 4 taels, and the spread was not much, until at 4:20 Richang, etc. also sold out, finally for 23 taels and 6 mace. At 4:30, the market closed at 24 taels and 2 mace, and then suppressed to 23 taels and 67 mace, about 12 taels higher than the skyrocketing of the 14th, according to the whole day's maximum 28 taels and 4 mace, the smallest 17 taels and 8 mace, a difference of 10 taels and 6 mace, the bare bullion counted as an increase of 17 taels, because the swap had already increased.</p>
<p>Revealed Price Mostly Suppressed by Eleven Taels The revealed price was initially 787 taels, calculated as pressing 66 taels to 60 taels, at noon because American dollars was again smaller by 125, it was changed to 790 taels, calculated as pressing 623 taels, in the afternoon it was changed to smaller 25, and it was 797 taels, calculated as pressing 70 taels to 73 taels, more than the 14th by 11 taels, registered for 90% 37 taels, November 27 taels, replenishing water in the morning 37 taels, afternoon 34 taels.</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange Changes Three Times a Day</p>
<p>Listed British Gold Shrunk Two-Five American Dollars Reduced by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Internal Plate First Tightened and Then Steadied Finally Turned Frustrated</p>
<p>In the past two days, the British silver bar has risen in price by two-fifths, and the American silver has leveled off. The exchange rate has been continuously decreasing. Therefore, the trend in the Shanghai market is tight. The HSBC listing only initially shrunk the American dollar by one-eighth, and the Indian exchange small two-eighth, the French franc decreased by two yuan, the German exchange by half a yuan, and the Japanese dollar by a small seven-eighth. The remaining, such as the English slope port, did not change.

The internal plate is also trending towards beauty and interest. In the early morning, it was tight, and then steadied. In the afternoon, it went from rising to frustrated. The result was two-fifths for English gold and American silver shrunk three-sevenths to four-sevenths compared to the 14th, and the gold price swap presented a sharp image in the sound, and the October price almost approached 740 taels. Because the swap was raised to more than 10 taels, the bulls held on, and the short side was greatly oppressed. Hua merchants' transactions are still prosperous, with English gold accounting for about 100,000 pounds, colleagues slightly released, and American silver accounting for about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Gold industry such as Chengfengyong, etc. were tying up against the empty, silver companies slightly entered October, and although the banks had sales, their will was very firm, and there was a possibility of shrinking back.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Yanghang Report On Thursday (15th), the New York stock market opened slightly higher and maintained until 11:00, suddenly plummeting. In the afternoon, public expectations for the number of freight cars were good, and the market rebounded again under the lead of railroad stocks. As a result, railroad stocks rose the most on this day. The total number of shares traded for the whole day was 3.1 million. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Yarn and Flowers</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Large-Scale Activity</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market, flat in the morning and rising in the afternoon, was due to the slightly active demand from the Guangdong gang and a change in the hearts of the people. However, the situation of foreign cotton is still weak as before. Some manufacturers have small ideas, and the general retail investors also tend to sell, but Rongxing's bulls are still safe and sound. In short, the bottom of the base yarn is too thin, and the reaction is faster.</p>
<p>Human Standard Assisted by the Promotion of Actual Needs. The human standard opened in the pre-market, with the price of American cotton falling sharply the previous day, and the atmosphere was very tired. Most people looked down on the decline of each month by one penny. In the afternoon, the actual needs were active, and each month rose sharply by one or two cents and four, five, or six cents. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 29,300 packages. It was found that Delong sold 2,150 packages, Yichang 3,100 packages, Gengfeng 1,000 packages, and Shenda 1,000 packages. Renfeng bought 1,300, Changfeng 1,900 packages, Dafeng 1,200 packages, and Rongxing 650 packages. The closing price is listed below.</p>

<p>The cotton market saw a morning decline followed by an afternoon rise. However, the imported cotton market remained sluggish, prompting textile manufacturers to aggressively sell off their stocks. The volume of unsold bales continued to accumulate, reaching approximately 160,000 piculs. This strong selling pressure was likely due to the favorable domestic new cotton production this year, leading to an inclination to sell and exert downward pressure. Despite this, imported cotton from the Wing On mill arriving in Shanghai was still priced between 38 and 39 taels. Furthermore, the current standard has been changed to fine cotton, which is two grades higher than last year. Therefore, buying occurred during the dips, and with exchange rates tightening, the market rose as new sellers faced shortages.</p>

<p>The Zheng Standard market opened weakly in the morning due to declining US cotton prices and large-scale selling by major players, causing declines of 5 fen to 2.5 cents across all months. In the afternoon, reports of heavy wind and rain in the Hankou region for the past two days, causing further damage to the new cotton crop, led retail investors to cover their short positions, pushing prices up by 3 to 4 cents across all months. The total trading volume for the day was 66,000 piculs. Sales included 4,000 piculs from Mei Kee, 3,300 piculs from Geng Feng, 4,600 piculs from Yuan Da, 2,300 piculs from Heng De, and 2,400 piculs from Yuan Da. Purchases included 7,400 piculs from Chang Feng, 3,000 piculs from Shen Kee, 2,000 piculs from Xing Yuan, 2,000 piculs from Xing Chang, and 1,700 piculs from Ji Feng.

<p>Hu Nan: Over the past two days, the rice market saw shipments from over thirty dealers. Sales in urban and rural areas have become more active since the Mid-Autumn Festival. New Japonica rice from Changshu and Chen Po, as well as rice from the Suzhou group, immediately rose by 0.3 taels. New Du Jian followed the rise and sold out immediately, increasing by 0.1-0.2 taels. Around 3,000 piculs were discharged at the Pujiang wharf.</p>
<p>News: Over the past two days, a total of 40 rice boats arrived. A total of 250 rice boats arrived from the river areas, with an estimated cargo of 17,500 piculs. At the opening bell in the morning, Northern Japonica rice, early rice, and new Japonica rice all rose by 0.2 taels. However, the situation eased in the afternoon. Glutinous rice trades were strong, and the market showed signs of tightening. There was a shortage of Du Yang Jian rice, and prices remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Larger by 0.15 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was quite active, with Saigon rice being the most sought-after commodity in the city. However, the stocks of medium and high-grade rice were mostly small-grained varieties. The total rice inventory in Shanghai was 830,000 bags, with small-grained rice accounting for 85% and Saigon rice accounting for 75%. Sellers were determined to hold onto their stocks and were unwilling to easily sell, while buyers' demand was strong. Yesterday, a total of 2,000 bags were offered, with prices 0.15 taels higher than before the festival. Small-grained rice sales have been weak recently, and although sellers were unwilling to easily sell, prices could not rise. Yesterday, over 1,500 bags were offered, with prices ranging from 8.63 to 8.55 taels. Medium and second-grade rice ranged from 8.5 to 8.4 taels. Number 1 Saigon rice ranged from 9.5 to 9.35 taels. These were all purchased by local dealers, with no inquiries from out-of-town buyers. Xiangxian rice and other varieties also saw no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Flour: Sharp Decline and Small Rebound <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of a sharp decline after opening in the morning. The prices for foreign wheat plummeted by 0.5-0.7 taels from the closing price before the market break. Although the price rebounded by 0.1-0.3 taels yesterday, the near-term outlook remained poor. Therefore, market sentiment was weak after the opening. Later, foreign firms reportedly dumped wheat at extremely low prices, with rumors of 3.75 taels being offered and even 3.72 taels being considered, causing market panic. Sellers aggressively sold, and mill outputs were strong. The momentum of selling and the rumors of foreign wheat dumping caused long-term contracts to decline even more. The strange phenomenon of November contracts being inverted was seen, showing market sentiment was bleak. At the close, the trading volume reached over 600,000, with prices falling by 0.2-0.4 taels. When the market opened in the afternoon, market sentiment gradually stabilized, and mills stopped selling. Some speculative positions were covered, and market sentiment improved slightly, rebounding by about 0.1 taels. However, the practice of ordering foreign wheat has begun, and prices are unlikely to rise excessively. As a result, this month's price fell by 0.0125 taels compared to before the market break, October fell by 0.0175 taels, November fell by 0.0225 taels, December fell by 0.0275 taels, and January and February each fell by 0.03 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed signs of stabilization in the morning for all months. Foreign wheat prices had fallen sharply by 0.5-0.7 taels the previous day, but rebounded by 0.1-0.3 taels yesterday. Therefore, both buyers and sellers were in a wait-and-see mode, with little change in the near term. Selling was strong in the long term, and the market showed signs of weakening. When the market opened in the afternoon, market sentiment weakened again due to the sharp decline in the flour market in the morning and the negative sentiment regarding foreign wheat. The market feared that excess wheat would be dumped again. Not only did the long-term outlook weaken, but the near term could not be held. If merchants have wheat contracts for foreign wheat, the wheat market may repeat the mistakes of the past. As a result, this month's price fell by 0.04 taels compared to before the market break, October fell by 0.06 taels, November and December fell by 0.06 taels, January fell by 0.07 taels, and February fell by 0.09 taels. The current wheat market is still active, and prices are stable. Suqian wheat opened at 3.52 taels, totaling 3,000 bags.</p>

<p>New Fung Foreign Firm reported that on Thursday the 15th, Chicago wheat initially fell due to the weak New York stock market, but later rebounded due to better export claims. As a result, prices rose by 0.25-1 pound compared to the previous day. The total trading volume on the 14th was 40 million bushels. The closing prices for the 15th are listed below:</p>

<p>Overseas Raw Silk Market: Previously, Japanese silk was discounted and dumped, causing Chinese silk prices to plummet. European and American firms were eager to suppress prices and purchase. Chinese silk merchants were unwilling to sell at low prices, leading to a stalemate. Yesterday morning, foreign firms again invited Chinese silk merchants to negotiate transactions. A large quantity of yellow and white factory silk was again sent by telegraph to New York, Lyon, and other places. The outcome will depend on the telegraph response. Yesterday, Da Chang and Kaili imported 13-15 thread Jinshuangying silk, totaling 30 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, with prices ranging from 685 taels to 635 taels. Ganli imported 41 packages of 13-15 thread Sichuan yellow silk at a uniform price of 625 taels. Kechang and others imported 37 packages of medium to coarse Guopen yellow silk, with prices ranging from 285 taels to 300 taels.</p>

<p>Market Arrivals Increasingly Scarce...Customs House Preparing to Cease Weighing</p>
<p>This year, farmers in Haining's various towns and villages have all adopted the improved varieties issued by the guidance centers, resulting in good cocoon production. Unfortunately, the harvest is only 40-50% of the spring harvest. The cocoon market has been open for over ten days. Initially, each firm aggressively competed to purchase superior cocoons, pushing prices up to 46-47 yuan. The number of cocoons collected by each firm has only been 400-500 piculs. Recently, market arrivals have become increasingly scarce, and cocoon prices have continued to rise. Improved high-quality varieties have already risen to 48-49 yuan. Each cocoon firm is preparing to cease weighing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw the Dutch exchange rate strengthen, and afternoon gold prices rose again. The Public Association's clearing price remained firm. Number 24 raw and white sugar was offered at 14.55 taels, and several hundred bags were later traded at 14.525 taels due to the Mid-Autumn Festival having just passed and market activity not yet being robust. Regarding exchange pricing, the Jian group offered a batch of Zhenxing Number 3 rock sugar, totaling 120 packages. It should have increased in price, but the industry insisted on not allowing it and still traded at 10 taels. The later trading session did not accept it, and continued offering will definitely lead to price increases.</p>

<p>Metal trading remained quiet yesterday. The number of goods offered by the various markets was limited. However, the standards of each market have decreased recently due to easing prices overseas. Flat white iron, tinplate, new galvanized wire, and black iron sheets are all showing a downward trend. However, transactions were still limited due to tight credit, and market activity remained slow. However, there was surprising news: a white iron factory has emerged in Shanghai! The goods are managed by the China Steel Products Company. The first batch of spot goods has already been offered, with Number 24 priced at 10.075 taels per picul and Numbers 26 and 28 priced at 11 taels. 7-foot sheets are priced at 8.8 cents per sheet. The quality is said to be quite bright.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Slogans Are Not as Good as Heartfelt Calls <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The gun barrel should be pointed outward. We, who shout slogans, should not focus solely on shouting loudly to the outside world but should emphasize internal action to awaken our unpolluted conscience!</p>
<p>Solely shouting slogans to the outside world, you shout a sentence, and others echo you with the same sentence. If it's good, it's called awakening the national soul. If it's bad, it's like the frog teaching in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" or the "humming" of the Xiangshan artisans, or the chanting of sutras by the storytelling master.</p>
<p>In ancient times, when facing national and familial shame, people instructed others to shout slogans at themselves, not themselves shouting slogans at the masses. King Fuchai of Wu was a model example. To avenge the murder of his father by the King of Yue, he instructed someone to stand in the courtyard and loudly proclaim to him: "Fuchai! Have you forgotten the King of Yue who killed your father?"</p>
<p>In ancient times, people also spurred themselves on by shouting slogans to themselves! This slogan was not shouted aloud but recited silently. Zengzi was a model example. He examined himself three times a day, reciting the slogans silently to himself each day, calling out: "Have I been disloyal in my efforts for others? Have I been untrustworthy in my dealings with friends? Have I not practiced what I have been taught?" Slogans are not as good as heartfelt calls. Zengzi's method of self-鞭策 is more measured than Fuchai's. The anniversary of September 18th has arrived. I hope everyone adopts Zengzi's method of heartfelt calls, examining themselves three times a day, silently encouraging their own inner action to save the country.</p>
<p>Shouting slogans at meetings is certainly indispensable! My point is that heartfelt calls are more important than slogans. Those who have shouted slogans at meetings should especially examine themselves three times a day, silently calling out with their hearts.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Shanghai Miss <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Baishi</p>
<p>People in Shanghai call girls "Miss." The term "Miss" is not particularly rare. Girl, maiden, lass, young woman are all similar terms, used according to local customs. But adding "Shanghai" before "Miss" makes a big difference. "Shanghai Miss" does not mean any Miss who lives in Shanghai. The formation of a Shanghai Miss has conditions. Now I will explain the conditions for forming a Shanghai Miss.</p>
<p>When a Shanghai Miss is born, she is no different from others, like the ancient sages. But when she is around ten years old, if her parents intend for her to become a Shanghai Miss, then they must send her to a aristocratic school. The purpose of going to such schools is not about grades, curriculum, etc. First, it is to make the daughter understand what is called "beauty" and how "beauty" is cultivated. After class, she should not be allowed to do housework, because cooking, washing, wiping tables, and sweeping floors are fundamentally destructive to "beauty." The only work after class is to practice singing and dancing, because singing is practice for the vocal organs, and dancing can make muscles develop evenly and increase the curves. In addition, eating chocolate, spearmint gum, soda, and ice cream are also very important. Because this kind of training of the stomach is also very beneficial for future social prospects. From elementary school to middle school, all the way to university graduation, training in this unchanging way, plus some courses on watching movies, eating fancy meals, and riding in cars, will naturally create a generous, up-to-date, healthy, and beautiful social star, or in other words, a flower of society, or in other words, a Shanghai Miss.</p>
<p>The formation of a Shanghai Miss is not an easy thing. Without a wealthy father and a noble environment, don't think about becoming a Shanghai Miss. Some people who have not been properly trained and desperately try to become Shanghai Misses are truly miserable.</p>

<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>The two youths I know are both from wealthy families, enjoying the benefits of their ancestors. However, their actions are like ice and charcoal. Youth A, after the death of his parents, observes a vegetarian diet and worships Buddha. His home is always full of monks and Taoists, and he only hopes for his parents' rebirth in the Western Paradise, free from the suffering of reincarnation. Six years have passed like one day. He wears plain clothes and cloth shoes, and treats people with courtesy. No one would recognize him as the wealthy son of a mansion who rides a motorcycle. Youth B spends nights indulging in pleasure, squandering money like dirt. His father divided the family property for him, but he squandered it all in over a year and still demanded money relentlessly. If the old man even slightly offended him, he would raise his arms and threaten him, saying, "Killing you is nothing more than paying with my life." His attitude was fierce, like the impetuous and bold Zhang Xinsheng. The old man could only swallow his voice and weep, letting him do as he pleased, even afraid to show any anger. The world is full of people like Yang Wanshi, but I have never heard of anyone being afraid of their son like this. It also awaits Ma Jie Fu to come forward and lend a hand.</p>
<p>Who is Youth B? I don't want to say. Youth A is the so-called Lonely Lotus Hermit on the sea.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Taking Words Literally <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Yiwei Sheng</p>
<p>| Correcting a few misunderstandings |</p>
<p>Each character in our country's writing has its own meaning. Although many words need to combine several characters to create a new meaning, especially transliterations and direct translations of foreign words, because people have deeply ingrained the concept that each character has its own meaning, they still inevitably interpret these foreign words character by character, leading to many jokes or misunderstandings. For example, when copper coins were first circulated in Guangdong, because there was no corresponding customary name and because Hong Kong copper coins had already been introduced, the English word "CENTS" was transliterated as "仙士" (xian shi, meaning "immortal scholar"). However, some superstitious people believed that calling copper coins that would profane "仙" (xian, immortal) and "士" (shi, scholar), especially the inviolability of "仙," so they euphemistically called them "大錢" (da qian, big money) or "鏍" (luo, screw). This "鏍" character is pronounced like the level tone of the word "累" (lei, tired). In our childhood, this alternative name for copper coins was very common. Even now, people in Guangdong villages still call them that. Another example is the recently popular term "模特兒" (mote'er), which is a transliteration of the English word "MODEL." The original meaning is a model or exemplar, so people who pose for paintings are also called "模特兒." In fact, if you use a dog or a cow as a model for painting, you can also call it a "模特兒." However, in a society that takes words literally, because this term has the character "兒" (er, son) at the end and because of nude female figure painting, they have rigidly defined "模特兒" as a special term for nude women and even consider "模特兒" as an obscene and shameful term. This is truly a joke. Another example is "幽默" (youmo), which is also transliterated from the English word "HUMOUR." The original meaning is "humorous" and thought-provoking, similar to "滑稽" (huaji, comical). However, the person who coined the term thought that "滑稽" had been used excessively and even had a vulgar and frivolous connotation, so he did not translate Humour as "滑稽" but translated it as "幽默" instead. In fact, "幽默" is not a bad translation, but these two characters are too meaningful, because these two characters happen to be adjectives, and the meanings of the two characters are very similar. So, those who take words literally misunderstand them again. Misunderstanding is not a big deal, but they actually misuse them. They use "幽默" as "靜默" (jingmo, silent) or "幽靜" (youjing, tranquil). This is another big joke! If they see the recently popular terms "法西斯蒂" (faxisidi, fascist) or "布爾喬亞" (buerqiaoa, bourgeoisie), I wonder what they will think!</p>
<h3 id="e54">A Poem for Palanquin Carriers <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Shiyu</p>
<p>| Self-Reliance | And Self-Striving</p>
<p>In the past, when I was a teacher, I often told my students that self-reliance is the purest and most noble thing. For example, the money earned by those who sell pancakes and those who pull rickshaws is more worthy than the salaries of those in various government offices, agencies, and bureaus who can actually do their jobs without shame. Even we teachers sometimes catch a cold and miss a class or two, but we still receive our salaries without deduction. We should feel ashamed of those who labor. Therefore, I say that labor is sacred. Because pancake sellers cannot miss making even half a pancake, and rickshaw pullers cannot walk fewer than ten or eight steps, the money they earn is truly earned and they have no reason to be ashamed. I went to Mogan Mountain this time and after admiring the Biwu Waterfall, I was moved by the palanquin carriers' ability to work hard and strive. I wrote a poem for them:</p>
<p>Returning from viewing the waterfall, my feet are already weary,</p>
<p>Riding in a mountain palanquin, following the mountain's turns.</p>
<p>From high to low and low to high,</p>
<p>Contorted, wanting to look up, quickly bowing.</p>
<p>Mountain rocks are rugged, the path is narrow and dangerous,</p>
<p>The palanquin carriers all pant like Wu oxen.</p>
<p>Ten miles of road, a hundred miles of difficulty,</p>
<p>Straw sandals torn, one foot bare.</p>
<p>Sweat drips drop by drop onto the grass roots,</p>
<p>Mountain grass grows lusher, the ground richer.</p>
<p>Passing a ruined temple, briefly stopping the palanquin,</p>
<p>To drink clear spring water, seeking shade to rest.</p>
<p>Breath not yet steady, they set off again,</p>
<p>Commendable for their labor, self-striving and encouraging.</p>
<p>With this spirit and strength, they can handle great affairs,</p>
<p>Virtue and kindness widely spread, their plans and strategies unfolding.</p>
<p>How few are those who are wealthy and noble who cannot be corrupted,</p>
<p>Their spirit and strength fully revealed, their ugliness hidden.</p>
<p>Great are the palanquin carriers, my teachers,</p>
<p>Each step on solid ground, without shame.</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>"I don't know what other people there are besides you, except for my country, my hometown. I shed blood for you, and I am willing to sacrifice everything for you. I was not wounded on the battlefield, but I have suffered a great wound in my heart, which no one can heal except you. I am willing to give my life to the entire Chinese nation and do not want to receive any honors, but at least from you, I want to regain the rights to love that I lost before; because at that time I was not a soldier, so a soldier—your husband—snatched you away. I know that you admire warriors, and brave warriors, so I desperately resisted foreign aggression. I don't want to think about the future, I just want to continue to adhere to your principles and continue my work."</p>
<p>"I still don't understand how you only found me now. What happened before?"</p>
<p>"The day before yesterday, Zhu Qibo's daughter came to see me in the city. She came quietly alone. Her purpose was to express her sincere love to me, to make me understand that it is a very normal thing for a girl to admire a hero and be willing to show her love to him; but the people of the whole town, persuaded by her, unanimously worshiped a hero and donated money, which is extremely difficult. She also told me that there was a crazy woman and a poor widow in the town who had both donated money, which was very touching. I told her that I already had a very beautiful, intelligent, and affectionate wife, and that I was very satisfied and would soon introduce her to the people in the town. Sacrificing for the country is the responsibility of every citizen and should not be regarded as a particularly glorious thing, so it would be best to cancel the monument construction."</p>
<p>"Then how did you know that this poor widow was me, and that I lived here?"</p>
<p>"She also said that this was your modesty. You have contributed to the country, and both women and children admire you, which is truly worthy of praise! Like this widow, who lives a very hard life herself and also supports an unrelated crazy woman, yet she also managed to contribute a sum, isn't that your heroic honor? She repeatedly praised this widow, so I asked her what her name was and where she lived. She told me everything, and she was willing to take me to see this widow on the day of the dedication ceremony, so I kept it in my heart and was surprised and grateful to this Miss Zhu. I heard that she kissed me before we parted, so I agreed to personally attend the dedication ceremony."</p>
<p>"She kissed you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she kissed my hand deeply."</p>
<p>"Then you should be happy. Someone is building a monument for you, someone is giving you a kiss. You should be satisfied!"</p>
<p>"But you won't let me heal the wound in my heart."</p>
<p>"I heard that it is this Miss Zhu who will be in charge of the unveiling ceremony today. You should go to the meeting soon, to avoid her deep anticipation and unease."</p>
<p>"It is very easy for a soldier to have several women to comfort him, but there is no one who can understand the soldier's heart; especially me, I do not need flattery like meat on a chopping board, but I crave the spirit of a woman's pure soul."</p>

<p>Punish the Eastern Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Urging the Government to Quickly Determine a Grand Plan</p>
<p>National People's Salvation Federation Telegram: To all National People's Organizations and Newspaper Offices: The Northeast has fallen for a year. Initially, it was a mistake to adopt a policy of non-resistance, followed by a mistake to rely on the League of Nations. Procrastination has led to a situation where the violent Japanese are recklessly pursuing their insatiable ambition, openly recognizing the puppet organization in the Northeast, and signing the so-called Japan-Manchuria Protocol. All those with blood and spirit are filled with outrage. (Omission) We, the members of this federation, deeply lament the imminent demise of our country. We have convened meetings for discussion and resolved to immediately urge the government to order all provinces to dispatch large armies within a specified timeframe. These armies should converge and move north, aiming to gather all the military forces of the nation to punish the rebels and recover the lost territories. We must not continue to engage in prolonged resistance, passively waiting for negotiations, or simply paying lip service to the current situation. As this matter concerns the survival of the Party and the nation, we hope that everyone will rise up together and devise plans for salvation. In addition to sending telegrams separately, we hereby report to you. We hope for your understanding and oversight. Respectfully, the Preparatory Committee of the National People's Salvation Organization Federation. Furthermore, a telegram was sent to the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee in Guangzhou, urging them to promptly order the southwestern provinces to dispatch troops and jointly save the nation from peril, etc.</p>
<p>People's Organization Federation Telegram: To all compatriots nationwide: Japan has militarily invaded our three northeastern provinces, creating the puppet state of Manchuria to deceive the world. Now, it has specially dispatched the so-called plenipotentiary envoy Mutō to sign the Japan-Manchuria Protocol with the puppet state in Changchun today. This is no less than expressing Japan's determination to annex our three northeastern provinces even before the League of Nations Investigation Team releases its report. Its abandonment of the Nine-Power Treaty and destruction of international covenants are glaringly obvious. Our country has no other way out but to swear to resist until death to seek survival. We hope that all compatriots nationwide will rise up together, urge the government to issue a clear order to mobilize a large army to punish the puppet state, and, at the same time, recall the ambassador to Japan and strictly implement economic severance. For only in this way can we ensure the survival of our nation and people. We are sending this telegram with surging blood, feeling extremely urgent. Respectfully, the Shanghai United Federation of People's Organizations.</p>
<p>Trade Union Federation Telegram: To the esteemed Executive Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing: Following the September 18th Incident, the three northeastern provinces were lost. On September 15th, 1932, Japan recognized the puppet organization, and the three northeastern provinces were lost in both name and reality. For a year, our people have been running around appealing and requesting the central government to quickly determine a grand plan to recover the Northeast. However, each time we appeal, the central government lacks a firm attitude to announce to the nation, allowing the Japanese to take an inch and then a foot, taking advantage of the situation to encroach further. Now, the Japanese have recognized the puppet organization, the situation on the border of Jehol is critical, North China is in danger, and enemy warships are densely deployed along the Yangtze River, including famous cities and important towns. The situation is critical, leaving no room for delay. The people are panicked and cannot find peace day or night. Such a situation cannot be resolved by appealing to the League of Nations, which has no real power. We urge the central government to quickly determine a grand plan, launch a large-scale punitive expedition, and recover the Northeast to revive the nation's spirit in this critical situation. We also beseech you to issue a clear announcement to dispel public doubts. We are eagerly awaiting your orders. Respectfully, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, along with the Five District Water and Timber Industry Unions, the Newspaper Industry Guild, the Ink Manufacturing Industry Guild, the Leather Manufacturing Industry Guild, the Cantonese Steamboat Timber Industry Guild, the Civilian Steamboat Timber Industry Guild, the First District Dockworkers' Union, the China Seamen's Industrial Federation, the Shanghai Branch Preparatory Committee, the Tea Workers' Union, the Third District Silk Reeling Industry Union, the Preserved Meat Industry Union, the Fourth District Dockworkers' Union, the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, and the Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Union.</p>
<p>Hongkou Organizations Telegram: The United Federation of Civil Organizations Hongkou District Branches and the joint office of various organizations such as the Jiashing Road, Yangtzepoo, Broadway Road, Hankow Road, Soochow Road, Yinshang Road, East and West Seward Road, Avenue Road, North Szechuan Road, and North Kiangsi Road Commercial Federations, recognizing that the violent Japanese are implementing the recognition of the puppet state, should express strong opposition. Yesterday, we convened an emergency joint meeting to discuss measures and immediately issued two telegrams: (1) To the esteemed National Government in Nanjing: Japan's occupation of the Northeast has changed the color of our territory, leaving a stain. It has been a year since then. We grieve the loss of our land and lament the subjugation of our people. Our great shame and humiliation have reached their limit. Japan is using a policy of forceful occupation and implementing deceptive schemes to create a puppet state that is entirely under its control. Our government should order a punitive expedition to rescue the people of the Northeast from their deep suffering. Now, the Japanese have openly revealed their true colors and recognized the puppet state. The news has spread, and everyone is filled with outrage. At this critical moment, we must urgently recover our lost territories to complete our territory. We should order a punitive expedition. The Japanese dare to defy the world and attempt to destroy treaties. If we do not resist tyranny and seek complete justice, how can we uphold righteousness and proclaim justice? We urge your government to seek self-preservation, quickly determine a grand plan, and save the nation from peril, etc. (Omission) (2) To the esteemed Mr. Yan, China's chief representative in Geneva, and to all member states of the League of Nations: Japan has forcefully occupied our Northeast and single-handedly created a puppet state, which it has scheduled to recognize. The entire nation, upon hearing this news, vows to resist until death. Japan dares to reveal its ugly face, destroy peace in East Asia, and seize our territory, treating the world as if it were uninhabited. We urgently hope that you will uphold justice, support treaties, and sanction the violent Japanese to maintain world peace and promote international justice.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Japan Recognizes the Puppet Organization <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Comments from Various Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The Foreign Press Agency says: Japan disregards the world's disapproval and brazenly recognizes the puppet state. Various Western newspapers in this city have published editorials commenting on this matter. Among them, only The Times, from a Japanese perspective, speaks to defend and justify the action, saying that "Japan is aware that it is subject to the world's public opinion, and it continues its charted course without hesitation, which proves its confidence in the righteousness of its actions." The China Press mocks the celebration as "the last dose taken by a criminal" and criticizes the puppet state, which is protected and garrisoned by Japan without having to bear the cost, as "a free lunch." If Nanjing does not wake up quickly, it will also receive "a free lunch," which is deeply meaningful. However, because these are from a Chinese perspective, they are not exceptional. Other newspapers have different viewpoints. The following is a summary of the main points:</p>
<p>The French-language newspaper *Journal de Shanghai* said: "Japan is bearing all the costs of this move and is taking a risk, regardless of whether or not there will be a reaction at home or abroad. This is only because it is in the position of protector, with the highest power to manage national affairs. It can, based on its own selfish motives, formulate various provisions under the premise of experience in operating industries or public undertakings in Manchuria and ensuring that its interests are not lost... The Chinese government will, as usual, make ineffective appeals to the international community. In the future, it may discover that it has gone astray and, in the last five minutes, find another way out... Moscow will definitely conclude a reciprocal treaty with Tokyo, and one party will continue to operate secretly within its sphere of influence. Other countries will not express anything but will use the Lytton Report as their textbook. The Chinese government has gained very little from this. Although it has scattered seeds to the world, we will call it a false policy... At the beginning of the incident, if China had adopted a more practical policy, it could have forced Japan to declare its desires and not take any more excessive actions. This could have achieved considerable results, but it voluntarily plunged into the quagmire of international arbitration... Now it is deeply mired up to its neck... The struggle of wits and strength is only in its infancy, and the end is far away. During this period, Japan can consolidate the foundations of Manchuria, while China can only lead the swans and wait, groaning and sighing, or eventually lose patience..."</p>
<p>The Russian-language newspaper *Shanghai Zarya* said: "Japan's formal recognition of Manchuria is also the day that it formally begins to fight for the Pacific Ocean. In the future, the Far East will become the center of great changes in the world. If there is no third party to obstruct it, Japan will complete its consolidation of Manchuria. Once Manchuria is consolidated, Japan's recent historical future and its struggle in the Pacific Ocean will also be consolidated. The countries participating in this struggle will prepare everything to go to it. Because Manchuria's independence is successful, Russia's Far East will be isolated... [Russia] will create a situation where it does not need to use a single soldier or break an arrow to make it belong to Japan's sphere of influence. The Soviet Union cannot but consider this... Once the historical opportunity has arrived and Japan must leave Manchuria and enter Russia's Far East, who will be its enemy?... If the Far East environment is constructed in international and Russian plans, history will change this environment, but not in the history of the next few years, but in the history of the next few decades."</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* said: "According to the views of the Japanese Empire, it is not enough to only rule the railway area. Negotiations with China cannot achieve a solution that it considers satisfactory. Japan is proceeding with cultivating, protecting, and organizing an independent country according to its own model. It now believes that it has a mother-child relationship and can interfere in it... The world's great powers deeply believe that the result of continuing to expand their power will be bloodshed and war and will lead to collapse... The war in the near future is without question. If countries can avoid increasing their territory and expanding their power, then war may be stopped..."</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* said: "Its main idea is that our country only appealed to the League of Nations last time and did not invoke the Nine-Power Treaty. This time, it invoked the Nine-Power Treaty but did not notify the League of Nations. The procedures were incomplete, and both are regrettable."</p>
<h3 id="e58">Wu Chaoshu Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Chen Ce Came Along and Will Travel to Beiping and Tianjin Together</p>
<p>Wu Talks About National Salvation, Saying Self-Salvation Should Be Sought Quickly</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Personally Visited Mr. Wu for a Long Talk</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wu are Scheduled to Go to Hangzhou This Morning</p>
<p>Central Committee member Wu Chaoshu and his wife, along with former Guangdong Naval Commander Chen Ce, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 12:00 noon aboard the French postal ship "D'Artagnan" from Hong Kong. They disembarked at the China Merchants Zhongzhan Pier and went straight to their private residence to rest. According to Mr. Wu, this trip is entirely a private tour and does not involve any mission. After staying in Shanghai for a while, they plan to travel north to Beiping and Tianjin with Mr. Chen to inspect the situation in North China, etc. Mr. and Mrs. Wu will go to Hangzhou this morning to watch the tide. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcome at the Pier: Mr. Wu's ship entered the port at 11:00 AM and arrived at the China Merchants Zhongzhan Pier at 12:00 noon, immediately docking. Prior to this, the Water Police Corps Captain Zhu Haishan led eight police officers to provide security around the area. Those who came to greet them included Central Committee member Ma Chaojun, former Guangdong Naval Chief of Staff Jin Yanwen, Mayor Wu's younger brother Wu Zixiang, Municipal Government Secretary Tang Shixuan, and more than 20 relatives and friends of the Wu and Chen families. After the ship finished anchoring, the welcomers all went aboard to greet them. It was not until 1:00 PM that Mr. Wu and Mr. Chen disembarked together, got into a car, and returned to their private residence at 29 Gordon Road.</p>
<p>Wu Chaoshu's Remarks: Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, our reporter visited Mr. Wu Chaoshu at his residence and asked about the purpose of his trip. He replied that this was entirely a private tour and did not involve any mission, nor was he ordered by any party. After visiting the war zone in Shanghai, he plans to travel north to Beiping and Tianjin with his wife and Commander Chen and his wife to inspect the situation in North China. The reporter asked if he would meet with Zhang Xueliang. He said no. The reporter also asked if he would take a detour to Shanxi. He replied that he might go, but he would decide after arriving in Beiping.</p>
<p>The United States, Russia, and Japan: The reporter then asked about diplomatic issues with Japan and the possibility of a war between Japan and the United States or Japan and Russia. Mr. Wu immediately used his diplomatic eloquence to repeatedly state his views, many of which were pertinent and important. Mr. Wu said that although the conclusions of the League of Nations Investigation Team's report are said to be favorable to our country, in fact, the League of Nations has no way to solve this difficult situation. Now that Japan has recognized the puppet state, what the people of our country expect from the League of Nations may eventually become a pie in the sky. As for a war between Japan and the United States, it may not be easy to realize in the near future. A person in the U.S. Navy once wrote an ideal novel about a war between Japan and the United States. The content roughly said that a war between Japan and the United States must have a flashpoint in a certain place in China. After the start of the war, the Japanese navy can occupy the Philippines within three days, and Honolulu is also in danger. The final victory of the United States lies in its ability to persevere, etc. This shows that it is well aware of the weakness of the U.S. Navy's long-distance expedition. Therefore, the U.S. government cannot have any positive expression unless it has obtained diplomatic support. As for a war between Japan and Russia, although it is relatively more possible, the current Soviet Russia is making every effort to consolidate its internal affairs and make its social economy tend to stability. It adopts an extremely tolerant doctrine toward external oppression. Even its external propaganda of communism has recently reduced its strength. Therefore, even with various provocations from the Japanese side, Russia is retreating step by step and will never have a head-on collision, which can also be asserted, etc.</p>
<p>National Salvation Through Self-Salvation: Mr. Wu also said that since the League of Nations is incapable and a war between Japan and the United States or Japan and Russia is impossible, will our people just sit idly by and watch the loss of the three northeastern provinces and be helpless? No. National salvation can only be achieved through self-salvation. On the one hand, the volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast are making continuous resistance in difficult circumstances. On the other hand, the people are strictly implementing economic severance. Then, although Japan has obtained the Northeast, the expenditure on military expenses is huge. At the same time, due to the disturbance of the volunteer army, it affects its production volume. At that time, its country will definitely feel the pain of not being worth the loss. Our country can take the opportunity to use diplomacy, or it can manipulate the final victory.</p>
<p>Not to Serve as a Diplomat: The reporter also asked if the central government intends to rely on you to take charge of diplomatic affairs, what would you express? Mr. Wu replied that I plan to go north by waterway this time and will not go to Nanjing for the time being. Even if the central government has this intention, I will definitely not dare to accept the order because of my weak talent. Doing diplomacy requires internal unity, otherwise, the opinions of the government and the people will be divided, and the people in the government will act on their own. Then what can be done externally, etc. Mr. Wu also said that Mr. Sun Zhesheng will come to Shanghai soon and will be the head of the Executive Yuan. I have not heard of it before. As for Mr. Hu Zhantang, he has no intention of coming to Shanghai for the time being.</p>
<p>Willing to Return to Lead Qiongyai: Regarding the position of the head of the Qiongyai Special Zone, Mr. Wu said that he has never resigned from it. However, now that the Qiongyai area is not peaceful, he is still willing to go to take office after it is pacified, etc.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Visits: Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government personally went to Mr. Wu's residence on Gordon Road to visit Mr. Wu. He asked about the situation in Guangdong in great detail and talked for about half an hour before taking his leave.</p>
<p>Going to Hangzhou Today: Mr. and Mrs. Wu are scheduled to take a car to Hangzhou this morning to watch the tide. According to Mr. Wu, he does not intend to meet with Wang Jingwei in Hangzhou.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Due to Inspection of Opium <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangshun Steamer Caused a Misunderstanding by a Japanese Warship</p>
<p>Almost Leading to a Major Dispute</p>
<p>On the night of the 14th, the Jiangshun Steamer fired a pistol due to the Water Patrol's inspection of opium, which caused a misunderstanding by a Japanese warship, which sent troops to search the ship. After obstruction by the ship's crew, it stopped. The steamer left port yesterday morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opium Inspection Dispute: The Jiangshun Steamer, which arrived in Shanghai from Hankou this time, was docked at the Nanzhan Pier after entering the port. At around 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th, several water patrol team leaders and police officers came to the ship to search for opium. After searching everywhere, they found nothing. The water police then went to the fire room and questioned the ship's stoker, Qian Caiyun, harshly, ordering him to hand it over. Qian refused, and a conflict occurred. The water police then locked up three stokers in the fire room and questioned them severely, which also sparked a dispute. They beat each other, and three stokers were injured.</p>
<p>Firing Empty Shots: After this incident occurred, the ship's chief engineer, G. Goulton, was informed and rushed into the fire room. Seeing that four of the sailors had been injured, he argued with the water police. The water police also bruised his leg. He then left the cabin and went to the deck. At that time, the water police drew his pistol and fired six or seven shots into the air, unexpectedly causing a misunderstanding by the Japanese navy, which almost led to a major accident.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship's Misunderstanding: When the water police fired their guns, a Japanese Navy 15th Squadron warship was docked on the nearby river surface. Upon hearing the gunfire, it immediately turned on searchlights to investigate the source of the gunfire. The Japanese warship quickly determined that the gunfire came from the Jiangshun Steamer, so it dispatched a team of soldiers to inspect the steamer.</p>
<p>Wanting to Conduct an Inspection: The Japanese warship immediately dispatched a team of navy soldiers, led by an officer, and launched a small launch, carrying the soldiers to the front of the Nanshi Pier and arbitrarily entering our country's merchant ship. The Jiangshun owner, Mai Dehui'an, came out to stop them. The Japanese soldiers asked where the gunfire came from, and the shipowner explained that the gunfire was from the Chinese water police who were carrying out inspection duties on the ship, so there was gunfire, and it had nothing to do with the Japanese warship. At this time, the water police on board had been persuaded to leave by the shipowner. The Japanese navy initially insisted on conducting an inspection, but after the shipowner repeatedly refused for half an hour, they finally retreated.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Authorities: After the Japanese soldiers retreated, the water police came to the ship twice more and searched out two packages of opium. At that time, because Qian Caiyun's injuries were very serious, the three stokers were taken away. Afterwards, the four injured sailors were sent to a certain hospital by the bureau for treatment. Regarding the people on board who were found with opium, they firmly denied it. Yesterday, the bureau had reported the situation of the water police's inspection of opium, the conflict with the sailors, and the gunfire causing a misunderstanding by the Japanese navy, which sent armed soldiers to the ship and forcibly wanted to search it, to the municipal government, requesting negotiations with the Japanese side to stop it, so as to avoid similar incidents from happening again.</p>
<p>Team Member's Talk: Our reporter made a special visit to the Water Patrol Team yesterday. According to a team member of the team, in the past two months, the team has repeatedly cracked major cases of large quantities of opium on various steamers sailing on the Yangtze River. Because the team is responsible for its duties, it has not dared to neglect in the slightest. Therefore, whenever a steamer arrives at the port, it must be inspected in accordance with the order. Moreover, when the Jiangshun Steamer set sail from Hankou, the team had received a tip that the steamer was carrying a large quantity of opium in its fire room this time. Therefore, when the steamer arrived at the port, the team leader and police officers immediately went on board to search it that night. Unexpectedly, at that time, because there were few of us and many of them, those guys dared to seize guns from the police officers and at the same time used wooden sticks and iron rulers to resist arrest. For the sake of self-defense, the police officers had to fire warning shots, and as a result, one of the police officers of the team was seriously injured, which also shows the barbarity of those guys at that time. But in the end, two sacks of opium, totaling nine large packages, were found in the fire room of the steamer, and three people were arrested by the police and sent to the Judicial Section together. As for the Japanese navy's misunderstanding at that time, the team was not responsible for it. The team leader has reported the situation to the bureau chief and the mayor for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Sichuan Provincial Government Telegram <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Tibetan Bandits Still Plan to Counterattack</p>
<p>Sichuan-Xikang Army, Knowing Their Deceptive Plan, Rapidly Seizes Chamdo</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government Office in Shanghai received a telegram from the Sichuan Provincial Government yesterday, saying that it had received a telegram from Kangding stating that after our (Sichuan-Xikang) army captured Dege and other counties, the Tibetan bandits, in order to buffer, were both asking us for peace and actively trying to cross the Jinsha River to counterattack.旅長 Yu Ruhai旅長 has already telegraphed Liu Zongzhihui (Wenhui) to instruct everything and ordered his troops to join forces with the troops from Xining to attack Chamdo quickly. The Tibetan bandits have no base in Kang, and they must withdraw from the country. In recent days, our side has been very victorious. Chamdo can be taken within days. Also, the officers and soldiers of our vanguard troops in the Tibetan expedition who died in the Zhucheng Chase Egg Formation on the 删除th (15th) of the month greatly shook the morale of the front line that day, and they all wanted to win the final victory to lay the foundation for Xikang and consolidate the border.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Advises Various Industries <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Goods Should Be Carried by Domestic Ships</p>
<p>Mutual Relationship Is the Only Way to Survive</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to various trade associations and the four major commodity groups yesterday, saying that the letter from the Municipal Shipping Trade Association on the 14th stated that "Chinese people use domestic goods, domestic goods are loaded on domestic ships, and domestic ships use domestic coal. This mutual relationship and mutual obligation must not be interrupted or neglected. Now that domestic ships use domestic coal, the industry has painfully realized this. Chinese people also use domestic goods, which is gradually becoming widespread. However, domestic goods loaded on domestic ships has not been fully implemented. It has been found that most of the various domestic goods in the city that are produced by factories and distributed to other ports are still loaded on foreign ships. The cigarettes of the Nanyang Huacheng Tobacco Company are the most numerous and most famous. Other domestic goods are too numerous to mention. This mutual relationship is therefore interrupted, and this mutual obligation is therefore neglected. To infer its influence and seek its results, it is feared that it is not only our domestic ships that have no hope of survival. Your association is the center of various industries, and it will definitely not discriminate in supervising its members. Now that you have warned domestic ships must use domestic coal, and you have not issued a warning for domestic goods not to be loaded on domestic ships, it must be because the investigation has not been completed and no one has reported it. Our association has seen and heard it, and we dare to send you a letter. We respectfully hope that you will examine it and quickly give a practical warning. From now on, all domestic goods in the city and all factories manufacturing domestic goods that are shipped to other ports must be carried entirely by domestic ships, so as to help each other survive and show their determination to save the country." Our country has been economically invaded by the great powers, and the losses incurred over the years are enormous. Now that the national crisis has not ended, all citizens should be vigilant and self-disciplined and seek ways to save the country. Even a small amount of money used in peacetime should be carefully selected for its destination to identify its advantages and disadvantages. Unless it is absolutely necessary, how can we arbitrarily give profits to foreigners and disregard the economic livelihood of our own people? The contents of the letter are pertinent to the times and must be seriously warned. In addition to sending a separate letter, we hereby write to your association to check and advise your members that from now on, all goods shipped to other ports must be carried by domestic ships in order to promote them and avoid the outflow of rights and interests. This is what we hope for.</p>

<p>Bombing at Minghua Store</p>
<p>Two Panes of Glass Shattered</p>
<p>Customers Were Greatly Frightened</p>
<p>The Minghua Silk and Satin Store at No. 485 Nanjing Road received a warning from the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group on August 20, saying that the store had re-sold the inferior goods that had been sealed up. The store immediately published a statement in the newspaper. Unexpectedly, at around 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon, when customers were crowded, a teenager in a gray long gown suddenly went up to the second floor in a hurry. Before long, he came down and walked to the middle of the store, where he shouted for customers to evacuate quickly. Then he threw a bomb into the store and ran away. But the explosive force was not strong, so no one was injured. Only two panes of glass facing the street were shattered. The Old Gate Police Station was informed and immediately sent detectives to investigate. They also picked up the exploded iron fragments and kept them for the record. It is heard that the store received another warning letter after the incident, explaining the reason for throwing the bomb.</p>

<p>Requesting Consultation with the Ministry of Railways to Change Original Land Acquisition Plan</p>
<p>Hong Lanxiang and Wang Shouyu, municipal committee members of the Zhenru District of Shanghai Municipality, submitted a document to the mayor yesterday, stating, "We are submitting this report based on the actual situation. Seven or eight out of ten residents in our district are farmers, and they rely on the income from cultivation for their livelihood. Farmers cannot survive without land to cultivate. The area of our district is less than 50,000 mu. After deducting rivers, roads, markets, villages, residences, and graveyards, there are only 30,000 mu of arable land. The farmers of more than 4,000 households already feel that there is not enough land. In the past ten years, land has been acquired in our district for Jinan School, Jinan New Village in 1924, and International Radio Telegraph in 1929. The area acquired by these three entities is more than 1,000 mu, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of farming households. Now, there is a proposal to relocate the Joint Transportation Terminal of the Ministry of Railways to Zhenru, and the land to be acquired extends west beyond Taopu to Jingtang, east to Wangjiajing Residence, south to Caijia Residence, and north to the Beijing-Shanghai Road, amounting to about 4,000 mu, almost one-tenth of the entire district's area. If this matter is carried out, at least 1,000 households in our district will lose their livelihoods. If these people, who depend on the land for their livelihood, lose the land they rely on for survival, how will they make a living? Living elsewhere is not their strength. If they leave their hometowns and go elsewhere, where in this vast land will they find a place to settle down? While the district committees were at a loss, this morning, hundreds of villagers, including Li Juqing, Li Bo, Zeng Zhi, and Hou Zhuoting, spontaneously gathered, bringing the old and the young, to request that we forward their plea to the mayor to find a way to stop this, so that they can eke out a living. Because this matter concerns the livelihood of farmers, we request that the mayor promptly consult with the Ministry of Railways to change the original plan and find another suitable location, so that the farmers in our district, who have survived the catastrophe, can barely survive. This would be a great act of benevolence. Respectfully submitted to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai."</p>

<h3 id="e70">Villagers in Enclosed Villages Petition the Railway Bureau <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau Indicates That the Base Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways is building a joint transportation terminal for two railways between Zhenru and Pengpu. The villages of Wangjiajing and Wangjiazai, north of Jiaotong Road, believe that their villages can be avoided. They petitioned the municipal government for relief some time ago. This newspaper reported yesterday that representatives were sent to the Two-Railway Administration to petition. The situation is detailed below:</p>
<p>Petition Situation: Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, village representative Hou Xuanqing petitioned the Two-Railway Administration on Baziluka, where he was received by Secretary Ding Zhenheng. The representative briefly stated that most of the villagers are farmers. Now that the farmland is about to be completely bought up, and the village houses are also enclosed, the villagers' livelihoods will be cut off. The suffering in the future is unimaginable. Although transportation is for the benefit of the country and the people, the problem of people's livelihood should also be taken into account. After investigation, the villages of Wangjiajing and Wangjiazai north of Jiaotong Road can be avoided in terms of geographical situation and railway construction. Therefore, we specifically request Director Chen to forward the request to the Ministry of Railways for relief, and to request that it be submitted to the Two-Railway Rehabilitation Meeting for discussion to allow avoidance, which the villagers will be extremely grateful for. Secretary Ding replied that the Railway Bureau also understands the suffering of the people, so the villages should be avoided as much as possible to alleviate the people's difficulties. The villagers' intention is to ask Director Chen to forward it to the Ministry of Railways for approval.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau's Statement: Yesterday, a Datong News Agency reporter specifically asked Chen Xinghan, Director of the Two-Railway Administration, for his opinion on the matter of the villagers in the villages enclosed by the Ministry of Railways requesting avoidance. Secretary Ding kindly received the reporter on his behalf. He said that the Ministry of Railways, in order to rehabilitate Shanghai and facilitate transportation, will relocate the North Station and build a joint transportation terminal. Director Chen had previously submitted a plan for the rehabilitation of the two railways to the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry of Railways then formed a Two-Railway Rehabilitation Committee to be in charge of the matter. All rehabilitation plans for the two railways are discussed and decided by the committee. Regarding the relocation of the North Station of the two railways and the construction of the joint transportation station, it was previously planned to purchase four to five hundred mu of private land. Officials sent by the Ministry of Railways have been carrying out surveying work in recent days, which has not yet been completed. The land enclosed has not yet been determined. However, the area surveyed is very large, which is to prevent speculators from taking the opportunity to buy and sell. Therefore, the current enclosure is temporary in nature. In the future, a location must be selected within the current enclosure. Whether there are villages in the current enclosure that can be avoided is a matter handled by the Ministry of Railways and the Public Works Bureau. I am not very clear about it. However, it is a fact that the villagers are suffering after the village is enclosed. I think the Ministry of Railways will decide to allow avoidance within the possible range.</p>

<p>Labor Dispute at the Tram Company</p>
<p>Union Executive Dismissed by the Company</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Has Sent Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>All workers in the Vehicle and Machine Departments of the Public Concession Tram Company prepared to organize the Third District Hydroelectric Industry Union last year. On January 1st of this year, under the guidance of Party and government agencies, it was formally established. Unexpectedly, Executive Directors He Zhaoming and others were dismissed by the company, which caused a labor strike. The Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to investigate yesterday in order to conduct mediation.</p>
<p>Union Submission: The Third District Hydroelectric Industry Union submitted a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, stating, "Submission for Forwarding. According to the union case, Executive Director He Zhaoming and others reported, 'Submission for Request. I, Zhaoming, have been working as a coppersmith in the British Tram Company for many years. Unfortunately, since September 1931, I have been ill and requested leave according to regulations, which was approved. As the illness has not yet healed, I have requested and been granted an extension of leave. Due to the illness, the delay lasted until January 4th of this year, when I recovered slightly and went to the company to cancel my leave and resume work. Unexpectedly, the company supervisor (British) ordered that Zhaoming and others be suspended from their duties and not be allowed to resume work. I replied on the basis of reason that I had not violated the regulations and there were no acts of negligence. I still requested to be allowed to resume work in order to ensure my livelihood. Not only did the supervisor not grant my request, but he also said that he had learned that I was active outside organizing a union, and therefore dismissed me. According to law, workers are allowed to organize unions, and this does not hinder my duties. How can the company dismiss me on this pretext? I immediately reported to your union and requested that it be forwarded for negotiation. Later, due to the rampant violence of the January 28th Incident, union affairs were suspended, and the matter was delayed. Now it has been restored to its original state. I have to ask your union to forward it to the Party and government agencies to send personnel to negotiate with the company to allow me to resume work, and to demand that the unpaid wages be paid in full. This is a matter of public convenience.' According to this, the employee has been working in the British Tram Company for many years and has never had any negligence. Since November of last year, he has enthusiastically initiated the organization of a union and legally submitted an application. He was elected as a preparatory committee member. He had been responsible for all union affairs. During his responsible period, he became ill and applied for leave from the company. Since the preparatory work was completed and was being established, and the illness was also cured, he went to the company to resume work. Unexpectedly, the company dismissed him for organizing the union, and he has been unemployed for more than eight months. The livelihood of his family is difficult to describe. The union believes that the employee lost his job due to public affairs, and the company unreasonably dismissed the worker, resulting in no effective guarantee for workers' work. The situation is very pitiful. Therefore, we have submitted this document to request that your union bureau investigate and send personnel to negotiate with the company for reinstatement and to demand that the wages during the suspension period be paid in full in order to facilitate union activities and ensure security. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>Authorities Investigate: After the establishment of the Third District Hydroelectric Union, the Tram Company dismissed Executive Director He Zhaoming (machine worker), Gong Hongfa (machine worker), and Fang Xiuyan (vehicle worker) on the pretext of dismissal. All the workers heard about it and believed that the company was undermining union activities, and they were very angry. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Third Section, to investigate yesterday in order to conduct mediation.</p>

<p>Receiving Congee and Applying for Rice Tickets</p>
<p>Since the Zhabei Charity Association opened the second congee kitchen on Liuying Road last month, it has been nearly two months. Every morning at 5:30, disaster victims, unemployed men and women workers from all roads go to the factory to receive congee. The number of elderly, weak, women, and children has increased to seven or eight thousand, and more than sixteen shi of congee rice are needed every day. Most of the large and small factories in Zhabei have recently closed down, and more and more workers are eating congee, and the need for rice is huge, and the funding is extremely tight. In addition, thousands of poor people from the disaster area have come to the Zhabei Charity Association to apply for rice tickets, and the situation is getting more and more crowded. It is reported that Wang Binyan, the director of the association, has submitted a request to the City Government War Zone Relief Committee for allocation of assistance, which has been approved and maintained by the Relief Group.</p>

<p>Father and Son Become Enemies Over Sale of Ancestral Property</p>
<p>Family Feud Erupts at Mid-Autumn Festival Feast</p>
<p>Father and Son Each Have a Witness</p>
<p>Two Witnesses Are Also Father and Son</p>
<p>Lu Gentao, a local resident, is currently fifty years old and works as a Hongbang tailor. His son, Lu Jinbao, is twenty-six years old and works as a coppersmith in the machine shop of a certain factory. Since childhood, he has been adopted by Lu Zhao, a woman of the same clan, as her adopted son. Last autumn, Lu Gentao sold a piece of ancestral land to his nephew Lu Changming (the eldest son of Lu Jinbao's brother Lu Jintao). After receiving the money, Lu Jinbao came forward to claim that he wanted to share in the proceeds. Gentao refused to give him any money since Jinbao had already been adopted out and had no right to inherit, and a grudge between the father and son grew. One day, Jinbao carried a copper-handled dagger, intending to harm his biological father. His uncle Lu Jintao found out about this and took the knife away, and the matter subsided. Recently, Lu Zhao also wanted to sell the property to Lu Changming, but a dispute arose in the middle, resulting in litigation. Lu Changming sued Zhao in the civil court of the First Special District Court, and Zhao lost the case. The day before yesterday was the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival. Lu Changfa, the second son of Lu Jintao, hosted a lunch for his family at his residence at 3101 Dongyouheng Road. Lu Gentao and his son were both invited. Unexpectedly, just as the relatives and friends were seated and about to eat, Gentao and his son had another conflict over the issue, and Lu Jinbao picked up a wine bottle on the table and hit his father hard on the head, causing a serious injury. Blood flowed all over his face and the glass shattered. Someone reported the incident to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to arrest Lu Jinbao and take him, along with the broken pieces, to the police station for detention. Lu Gentao was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the summary court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the above situation, saying, "Please pay attention to Article 298 of the Criminal Law, which states that those who injure their direct ascendants should have their original sentence increased by two-tenths. Therefore, please severely punish him as a warning to those who defy morality." Lu Gentao and his witness Lu Jintao also reported the case, proving that yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and when they were having lunch, Jintao persuaded the defendant, a young man, not to drink too much, but the defendant did not listen to the good advice and took offense. He picked up the wine bottle on the table and hit Gentao on the head, and then punched him three times, causing injury and bleeding. They also hired attorney Xi Yafu to appear in court and bring a private prosecution, requesting that in addition to the heavy punishment, he be ordered to pay medical expenses of eighty yuan. When questioned, the defendant denied the accusations, saying that the plaintiff had designed to frame him, and that his finger had been bitten by the plaintiff. He also hired attorney Gan Lin to appear in court to defend him. Finally, the defendant invited his witness Lu Changfa (Lu Jintao's second son) to testify, saying, "Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and I invited the clansmen to lunch. The plaintiff suddenly came and dragged the defendant out and beat him in the courtyard. I did not see the defendant hit the plaintiff with a wine bottle." Lu Jintao and his son acted as witnesses for the plaintiff and the defendant, respectively, which was a funny thing. Then the lawyers from both sides began to debate, and Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the case and announced that the debate in the case was over and the sentence would be pronounced next Monday. The defendant was remanded in custody. It is unknown how this case of moral outrage will end.</p>

<p>Maximum Height Reached Over Thirty-Nine Feet</p>
<p>In past autumn floods, the tide would rise violently, damaging crops, causing great concern to farmers. However, since the autumn floods this year, the tide has not been very high, so the rice crops in the four villages of Songjiang have not been damaged. This flood was the largest of the year. Since the day before yesterday (15th), the tide has been high. The maximum daily tide has risen to thirty-eight feet (customs water scale), and the evening tide has risen to more than thirty-eight feet. Yesterday, due to the northeast wind, the tide rose even higher, and the water was red, with rapid currents rising to more than thirty-nine feet. The tide in the Wusong Yunzaobang was level with the outer road. If it rises another half a foot, it will rush into the road, and residents may suffer again. Fortunately, although it is a northeast wind, the east is large and the north is small. If the north is large and the east is small, the residents would be unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Ruling on the Three Friends Dispute <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Officials Urge Company to Comply</p>
<p>Company Appeals the Ruling</p>
<p>Workers Resume Hunger Strike This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, sent a telegram to Mayor Wu of Shanghai regarding the labor dispute and closure of the Yinxiang Port factory of the Sanyou Industrial Society, urging the company to comply with the arbitration award. The company defied the order and refused to pay for meals. The municipal government and other parties met yesterday to discuss solutions. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Company Has Appealed: Following the ruling by the Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee on August 31 regarding the labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Society, the company immediately expressed its disagreement. Several days ago, it prepared a petition and dispatched Managing Directors Shen Jiucheng and Wang Xianhua, Acting Factory Manager Lao Huimin, and Secretary Chief Ji Jiannan to the local court to file an appeal. Regarding the meal expenses of more than 1,200 workers in the factory, amounting to 120 yuan per day, the company, citing financial burden, refused to pay.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang’s Telegram: Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, sent a telegram to Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, which stated in brief, "The arbitration decision on the labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Society Cotton Mill is appropriate. It is hoped that the company will be persuaded to comply with the arbitration award."</p>
<p>Municipal Government Order: The Municipal Government issued an order to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating, "For compliance with the order, according to a petition submitted by Zhang Yihai and others, standing directors of the 7th District Cotton Textile Industry Union, the company is deliberately appealing and suspending the payment of meal expenses. It is requested that emergency measures be taken to value human life." Based on this, a copy of the petition is attached, ordering the bureau to promptly instruct the company to continue to maintain meal expenses until the case is resolved. This order is issued.</p>
<p>Suspension of Meal Expenses: Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, six representatives from the 7th District Cotton Textile Industry Union, including Xia Zhongzhao, Qin Changgeng, Bao Boyi, Zhang Tingliang, Wu Renfu, and Qin Haiyan, went to the Social Affairs Bureau to collect meal expenses for two periods. The company still refused to pay. Representative Wang Xianqing from the Social Affairs Bureau then went to the Municipal Government to discuss effective solutions to quickly resolve the meal expenses issue, in order to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Workers Still on Hunger Strike: After hearing the news, the workers residing at the Labor Hospital immediately stated that if the meal expenses could not be received, they would continue the hunger strike. Because the company still did not provide meals yesterday, the workers continued their hunger strike this morning. The list of names is as follows: Hong Jiaben, Liu Yushan, Sun Xuren, Lu Shiying, Gong Yushu, Yin Mingzhang, Xie Yonggui, Zhang Zegang, Yan Qilang, Li Yinsheng, Mao Zhaocheng, Shen Yucheng, Fan Yinchuan, Hou Zhangyuan, Ma Jinchun, Zhao Weiyin, Liu Yuanxing, Gao Jinshan.</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Qiuxin Factory Labor Unrest Was Heard Yesterday <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Party and Government Mediation Still Yields No Results</p>
<p>The Company Proposes Three Demands</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, after a strike broke out at the Shanghai Army Camp Qiuxin Shipyard, the Party and government repeatedly sent representatives to mediate. Because the company's attitude was tough, there was no hope for a solution at the time. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Dai Yongchan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Zhu Jintao, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the Qiuxin Factory in the Shanghai Army Camp for negotiations. Mr. Medilo received them and stated that he was unable to handle the case at the moment, so he had telegraphed the general company in France to inquire about solutions. Finally, he added that the Party and government representatives could consult with the executives of the Shanghai General Company in Yangjingbang, which might lead to a reasonable solution. Therefore, the Party and government representatives went to the General Company again in the afternoon for negotiations. The general manager of the company received them and explained the intention of the Party and government agencies to mediate, and proposed two solutions: (1) The dismissed workers should return to work; (2) Wages should be paid as usual for the strike period. At that time, the general manager of the company agreed and requested two points from the Party and government agencies: (1) Be responsible for ensuring that all workers return to work; (2) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. The Party and government representatives replied that the first point was fully accepted, and that there would be no problem with the second point if the company did not oppress the workers. While the two sides were negotiating, Mr. Mai, the manager of Qiuxin Factory, unexpectedly intervened, insisting on dismissing the workers, and said that if the workers were allowed to return to work, the factory's face would be completely lost. After listening to Mr. Mai's words, the company's general manager completely overturned the previous agreement and proposed three unreasonable principles for resuming work: (1) Workers must return to work unconditionally by the 18th; (2) Salaries will be acknowledged one-third up to the 16th; (3) Worker No. 821 must be dismissed. At that time, the Party and government representatives refuted this, saying that the fault for the current labor unrest lies with the company, and that unreasonable conditions should not be proposed again. Thus, the two sides went to extremes, and at 4:00 PM, they dispersed without any results.</p>

<p>Starting September 16th</p>
<p>China Merchants, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, Taikoo, Hongan, Jiejjiang, Zhaoxing, Ningshao, Minsheng, Jufu and other ten companies issued a notice yesterday, which reads: To whom it may concern, our companies transport goods exported from Shanghai to the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and various ports in Hunan. The shipping fees are mostly paid monthly or seasonally. In recent years, the cost of various commodities has been high and expenses have increased daily. Moreover, all expenditures require cash, making turnover quite difficult. After public discussion, starting from September 16th, all shipping fees for goods shipped to the above-mentioned routes will be collected in cash or bank drafts (for a maximum of ten days).

<h3 id="e81">Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Prevents <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Merchants from Installing Telephones Beyond Borders</p>
<p>The Telephone Company Should Bear Full Responsibility for Delaying the Contract</p>
<p>Since the expiration of the telephone contract between the former China-Foreign German Telephone Company and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company's installation of telephones beyond its borders in the urban area has been stopped by the Bureau of Public Utilities. On the one hand, the bureau urged the company and the Telephone Bureau to negotiate a temporary contract for transition. Unexpectedly, although the company had signed and approved the draft agreement in October of last year, it has delayed signing the formal contract until now. Citizens, unaware of the details of the case, still apply to the telephone company for telephone installation. However, the company does not explain the reasons why installation is not possible, but instead instructs them to request a special permit from the Bureau of Public Utilities, hoping to shift responsibility. It was learned yesterday that the Bureau of Public Utilities specifically issued a letter stating that the company should bear responsibility for delaying the contract and should subsequently explain to users that it has not yet obtained exclusive operating rights and directly refuse installations, in order to dispel public misunderstandings. The original letter is excerpted below: Greetings, regarding the case of your company operating a telephone business in the road sections beyond the boundaries of the public concession and the French concession, since the Bureau, together with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and your company, respectively stamped and signed the draft temporary contract in October of last year, your company has delayed until now and has not indicated when the formal contract will be signed. This is regrettable. Before the temporary contract is formally established, your company should not install telephones in the above-mentioned sections according to law. Recently, it has been found that users residing in the sections have requested your company to install telephones, but your company does not immediately explain the reasons why installation is not possible and directly refuses it. Instead, it instructs them to request a special permit from the Bureau. This move on your company's part is nothing more than an attempt to delegate to the Bureau the responsibility for causing inconvenience to citizens. However, after the Bureau explained the details of the negotiation of the temporary contract in detail, most users were able to understand. In order to avoid unnecessary trouble for citizens, your company should, in the future, immediately explain that it has not yet obtained exclusive operating rights for telephones in these sections when encountering requests to install telephones in these sections, and refuse installation directly. Do not make excuses or shirk responsibility. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Telephone Company.</p>

<p>Respond to the Case of the Invasion of Asia-Europe and Are Willing to Vow Support</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the products of the Chinese Asia-Europe Electric Appliance Factory being excluded from sales in Southeast Asia by the Philips light bulb company, the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products and the China National Products Maintenance Association, in order to protect the interests of members and safeguard overseas trade, advocate serious negotiations. In addition to sending telegrams to various agencies to protest, they also sent letters to relevant public groups in various provinces and cities requesting assistance. According to telegrams from electrical industry trade associations and national products organizations in Hankou, Shantou, Tianjin, Qingdao, Chengdu, Beiping, Nanchang, Tangzhou, Kaifeng, Shanghai, the capital (Nanjing), Jinan, Hangzhou, Taiyuan, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Wuhu, Bengbu, Zhenjiang, Zhengzhou and other places, they successively replied, expressing unanimous support and vowing to be a backing force. Excerpts from the original letters are as follows: (1) Quick telegram from Hankou Electrical Materials Industry Trade Association, (omitted above) "Approved the telegram from your association that the electric bulbs produced by the Chinese Asia-Europe Electric Appliance Factory are sold in Java. Because of the suitability of quality and price, they are envied by the Dutch Philips Company, which makes slanderous accusations and excludes them in every possible way. Finally, the local authorities ordered them to stop selling, and they are still not satisfied, and even further demanded compensation for losses. How can this not cause grief and indignation! Since the opening of ports and seas, all countries have treaties for trade and protect each other without discrimination. However, the actions of the Dutch merchants are outside the scope of free commercial competition, and their authorities are also shielding them and striking overseas trade in violation of the spirit of the treaty. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Our merchants, in order to respect the development of national rights and interests, and not to implement the purpose of commercial treaty reciprocity, the real economy will be lost, and there is no hope for the future. Your association's duty lies in taking responsibility. I hope you will do your best to support so that negotiations can be resolved fairly and there is no disturbance in overseas trade. Otherwise, we will treat them in the same way, using profits to resist them. Our association is closely related and vows to be a backing force." (Omitted below) (2) Telegram from Chao-Mei National Products Industry and Commerce Federation, (omitted above) "Since foreign insults have become increasingly urgent and the national situation has become weaker, the initial rise of national products is like a baby leaving the wall to learn to walk, and there is always a fear of falling. What is relied upon is the government and the people, working together to promote and maintain it, like a nanny hoping to grow into an adult easily. Receiving your letter now, I am deeply saddened to learn that the various national electric bulbs produced by the Shanghai Chinese merchant Asia-Europe Electric Appliance Factory have been promoted and sold in the Dutch-occupied territories by the overseas Chinese Qingnian Trading Company. Overseas Chinese have always been angry at the imperialists for their oppressive power and love the applicability of national products, so they do their best to purchase and sell them. Therefore, they have touched the jealousy of the Dutch merchant Philips. Not hesitating to cause international resentment for commercial issues, they instigated the Dutch authorities to destroy them under the pretext that our national product Asia-Europe light bulbs have taken their argon gas and other manufacturing rights. They suddenly oppressed and stopped business with unreasonable problems. Hearing this, I am filled with anger. Hu Xiyuan of Asia-Europe Electric Appliance Factory has worked hard to improve and maintain, so that he has the current situation. Now, the Dutch merchant Philips, in order to protect his own interests, is actually destroying our country's inherent industry. Moreover, the manufacture of commercial goods, except for the new products that can truly be invented independently and obtained the permission of the government in the place of manufacture to issue a license and announce a patent, which can enjoy the exclusive manufacturing rights for several years, what is the so-called encroachment? The Dutch merchant Philips has not obtained the patent announcement from our government, so naturally, it cannot have any effect. What is the crime of counterfeiting? Then, if foreign merchants manufacture various kinds of goods to cater to the habits of our people and sell them in our country's market, can our merchants also say that they are encroaching on exclusive manufacturing rights? In summary, it is extremely unreasonable to make trouble. At this time, our country's national products are declining, and the market is almost completely invaded by foreign goods. Industrial and commercial organizations have repeatedly appealed and petitioned the government. They are trying their best to promote it above, and the people are realizing that the imperialists use cunning and hideous faces as tools for deception and are using national products below. Our association is responsible for protecting national products, and the chairman cannot refuse. I dare to inform the people of the country, to pay attention to promoting national products. The external pressure of the Asia-Europe electric bulbs is not enough to be afraid of. The meeting has already appealed to the Ministry of Industry of the National Government to transfer and consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to refute the shamelessness of the Dutch merchants according to reason, and should wait for the instructions and resolve them properly. If the Dutch merchant Philips still does not repent and considers our people to be deceivable, then our association will lead our members and request all compatriots across the country to unanimously not buy the electric bulbs of the Dutch merchant Philips as a way to deal with it. The Chu bow is obtained by the Chu people, and they can dispose of it freely. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Social Affairs Bureau Convened Various Industries <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>To Explain the Significance of Factory Inspection</p>
<p>Can Take Care of Factual Issues</p>
<p>The Results of Various Industries Expressing Their Opinions Were Satisfactory</p>
<p>After the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to start implementing the initial factory inspection on September 1, various industrial and commercial groups requested a postponement due to the decline of industry and commerce after the war. The bureau specifically convened various groups on the 14th and 15th to explain in detail, and the results were satisfactory. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Industry Representatives: On the 14th, Li Ruzhang and Yang Zhenxin from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Zhenzhang, Ye Zhangcheng, and Qi Fuming from the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, and Zhang Zemin from the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation attended. On the 15th, Wan Xuefang from the National Products Rubber Products Industry Association, Xian Guansheng from the Biscuit Candy and Canned Food Industry, Dong Xiyan from the Enamel Industry Association, Cao Runshen from the Lighter and Flower Rolling Industry Association, Zhu Xiaoyun from the Printing Iron Can Industry Association, Xiao Ziming from the Chinese Soap Industry Association, Wang Shiqiang and Jin Yinwu from the Electric Silk Weaving Industry Association, Yang Boru from the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association, Ding Chong from the Refining Industry Association, Hong Weiguan from the Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association, Xu Guanqun from the Cosmetics Industry Association, Wang Yaochen from the Flour Mill Industry Association, Fei Xiangxue from the Knitting Industry Association, and Shen Huachen from the Silk Factory Industry Association attended.</p>
<p>Chairman's Explanation: Tian Heqing, Director of the Social Observation Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, who chaired the meeting, elaborated in detail on the meaning of the Factory Law and the Factory Inspection Law promulgated by the state, and informed that it has been a year since the implementation of the two regulations, and the situation of each factory is complex, and compliance is not without difficulty. Therefore, this bureau has carefully considered the scope and method of the initial inspection. The purpose is to gradually eliminate the difficulties of each factory. Factory inspection, on the one hand, is to remind the factory of its legal obligations, and on the other hand, it can provide more opportunities to contact each factory, so that a more accurate view of the actual situation of each industry can be obtained, and all facilities can naturally adapt to the current situation. Then, the matters within the scope of the initial inspection were explained one by one to clarify that each factory does not have any reason to have difficulties. He also said that when factory inspectors carry out inspections, they should consider the actual situation and the difficulties of the factory, and asked them to submit them to the inspectors as much as possible. Finally, the representatives expressed many opinions, some on the general situation of the Factory Law, and some on the special circumstances of each industry. All were explained in detail by the chairman, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Please Severely Punish Counterfeit Merchants</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Court, requesting that counterfeit merchant Wen be severely punished, stating, "The cloth produced by our member, Xiecheng Cloth Factory, has long been registered with Longcheng as a trademark. In March of this year, rumors spread that Longcheng fine twill was replaced and counterfeited by enemy goods. A reward was offered in the newspaper. On August 22, 200 pieces of Longcheng fine twill were discovered at Shenda Transport Company, with the words 'Shanghai Tongtai sent to Shaoxing Yuantai received' printed on the package. We immediately reported it to the police and summoned Wu Zijing, the manager of Tongtai, for questioning. We have already filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai First Special District Court and have already had one hearing. Please uphold justice." "It has been found that the factory is a member of our association, and the goods produced are entirely national products. This time, Tongtai's counterfeiting not only caused losses to the factory, but also hindered the movement to resist enemy goods. If it is not severely punished, how can the law be maintained and cunning merchants be warned? Accordingly, we request your court to severely punish Tongtai's counterfeiting case in order to maintain national products."</p>

<p>After the Tonghua steamer ran aground at Huangsangkou in Qizhou, the China Merchants Bureau sent the Lijji and other steamers to tow it. Yesterday, the bureau received a telegram from Tonghua saying that the front part of the ship had run aground on the river bank, while the stern was still in the river. The arrival of the Jiangxin steamer also failed to tow it. It is particularly difficult to rescue it at this time, and the Tonghua steamer is very dangerous.

<h3 id="e87">The Murder Case on Paul Street Concluded <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Police Do Not Prosecute the Communists</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 23rd</p>
<p>Chen Yun (also known as Keming), a Shaoxing native residing at No. 7 Chengxinfang, Paul Street, allegedly used a kitchen knife to injure and kill Wang Zixi (also known as Huang Zixi, 23 years old), a native of Pudong, in the pavilion of the house at around 5:00 AM on the 7th of this month. After the case was discovered, he was arrested and escorted to the First Special District Court by Chinese and Western detectives from the Huishan Police Station. He has repeatedly confessed and details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong continued the hearing in the Fourth Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police, stated that the communist books seized in the defendant's bedroom in the pavilion of the house were being changed, and the defendant had consistently denied that they were his in the police station, so he would not be prosecuted. Huang Jintang, the father of the deceased, hired a lawyer to file a private suit, stating that the cause of the case was that the defendant had previously borrowed 80 yuan from the deceased and collected 11 yuan in rent privately. He asked him for it that day, which led to the incident. There was no ambiguity with his wife. The private suit now seeks to compensate the defendant for the loan and funeral expenses, totaling 591 yuan. When questioned, Chen Yun confessed that the communist books seized were not his, and there was no such thing as the loan mentioned above. He said that the deceased Huang Zixi came to his place to play and chat that day, and every time he mentioned asking his wife to come to Shanghai to live with him, it touched the hatred in his heart. In addition, he drank too much alcohol at the time and his nerves were disordered, which led to the incident. The court ordered the debate to begin, and the police lawyer Zhang said that the police accused the defendant of premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law, and the deceased suffered a total of 21 knife wounds on the chest, forehead, temples, ears, hands, and other parts, which was tantamount to dismemberment and was extremely cruel. He requested that the defendant be severely punished. Chen Yun was defended by a designated lawyer, Huang Xiubo. Chen finally claimed that he had an elderly mother, wife, and children at home and requested leniency. He had nothing else to say. Judge Shen ordered him to be taken into custody and await sentencing on the morning of the 23rd of this month.</p>

<p>Spreading to Four Neighbors</p>
<p>The wire on the third floor of the house of He Yixiang at No. 14 Dahuali, Belle Road, French Concession, suddenly exploded at 8:00 PM last night, causing a fire. The momentum was so fierce that it immediately broke through the roof and spread to Tiansheng Cloth Factory at No. 13 and a certain family at No. 15. Black smoke filled the air and the firelight soared. The residents in the house barely escaped with their lives. Upon receiving the news, the French Concession Fire Brigade immediately drove to the scene to put out the fire and tried to cut off the wires to prevent the fire from spreading. However, the fire was raging and difficult to extinguish for a while. As a result, the Yang family at No. 16 was also burned, and the fire spread to No. 17. After the firefighters bravely put out the fire until around 9:30 PM, the momentum was slightly reduced. An investigation after the incident showed that all houses from No. 13 to No. 16 were completely burned, and the three-story building at No. 17 was also burned. Among them, only Tiansheng Cloth Factory had fire insurance of 18,000 taels.</p>

<h3 id="e110">The True Meaning of Responsible Freight Transportation <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yu Yan, Director of the Railway Business Department</p>
<p>Speech at the Central Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>The topic I will discuss today is "The Significance of Responsible Freight Transportation and Its Relationship to National Economy and People's Livelihood." What is responsible freight transportation? Simply put, responsible freight transportation means that the railway assumes considerable responsibility for the goods entrusted by the shippers, from the moment the goods are received until they are transported to the destination and delivered to the consignee. Within this timeframe, the railway must assume corresponding custody responsibilities, the responsibility for safe and prompt transportation, and the corresponding responsibility for compensation for damages. In other words, the railway treats the shippers' goods as if they were its own, striving to ensure that they are not subject to any damage or delay and are delivered intact to the consignee. Unless due to force majeure events such as natural disasters, or changes in the nature of the goods themselves, or the shipper's own negligence, if the goods are lost, the railway is liable for compensation.</p>
<p>Railways in all countries around the world are responsible for the goods entrusted by shippers. They do their best to provide convenience and happiness to merchants. All damages to goods that should not have occurred under the railway's responsibility are compensated. Since the responsibility borne by the railway is very heavy, its equipment and personnel must strive for thoroughness and perfection. Shippers also have increasing trust in the railway. In name, the railway and merchants are separate, but in fact, they are one. Therefore, their railway freight increases day by day, and the business of the general public develops day by day. National strength is naturally a major reason. However, looking back at the situation of our Chinese railways regarding freight, our railways have never assumed any responsibility for the goods they transport. Because they are not responsible, the railway's equipment is as good as it can be, and the railway staff are as perfunctory as they can be. Over time, employees have developed bureaucratic bad habits, and the railway has lost its original business essence. Goods entrusted to the railway for transportation not only have no security guarantee, but also experience various inconveniences. Shippers, due to capital constraints, have to find other ways out. Therefore, various malpractices have arisen. The most obvious is the forwarding company. In order to avoid the trouble of dealing with bureaucratic railway employees and to ensure the safety of their goods and avoid losses, shippers have to entrust forwarding companies to report and transport goods to the railway on their behalf. Forwarding companies, driven by profits, seize the opportunity to monopolize and arbitrarily manipulate prices, or even collude with unscrupulous station employees, manipulating things from top to bottom. General shippers are greatly exploited. For more than fifty years, railway freight has declined day by day, and the suffering of merchants has increased day by day. It has reached the point where shippers can hardly survive, and the railway is gradually approaching bankruptcy. If we do not have any fundamental solutions, we can only wait for everyone to perish together.</p>
<p>This dangerous situation was seen as early as ten years ago, and the Chinese people have long wanted to find ways to remedy it. Therefore, at the National Railway Transportation Conference convened by the former Ministry of Communications in the tenth year of the Republic, it was decided to implement responsible freight transportation, and the general rules for responsible transportation were promulgated at the same time. However, due to various reasons, the various routes did not thoroughly and conscientiously implement it. These ten years have passed in vain. The various malpractices of railway freight are deeper than before, and the suffering of merchants is greater than before. Now, no matter which aspect you consider, freight on various routes can no longer be fundamentally rectified. The only way to rectify freight is to implement responsible transportation. Because the implementation of responsible transportation increases the railway's responsibility to shippers, equipment will naturally be required to be improved, and employees will naturally have to work diligently and not allow any perfunctoriness. Merchants transporting goods can follow a regular path and obtain real convenience. All past accumulated malpractices can be fundamentally eradicated. Only by fundamentally eradicating all kinds of accumulated malpractices can we talk about developing commerce, developing the social economy, and seeking happiness for the general public. This is the biggest motivation and the most important purpose of the Ministry of Railways' resolute implementation of responsible transportation this time.</p>
<p>Responsible freight transportation is a fundamental principle of railway freight transportation. Violating this principle means that the railway is abandoning its mission, and naturally there will be no good results. The reason why our railways have the current poor state and merchants feel extreme pain is because of violating this principle. After we implement responsible transportation, we can not only reverse the previous poor results, but also have unlimited hope for the future. This is a natural principle and can be asserted. Take the Jinpu and Jinghu routes, which started implementing responsible transportation on September 1st. The staff of all stations implementing responsible transportation have completely changed their past practices due to responsibility, and their work spirit has also been completely commercialized. Shippers also feel various benefits. Shippers who had doubts and misunderstandings about responsible transportation have gradually understood. Therefore, the responsible freight of the two routes is increasing day by day. On the first day of opening on September 1st, the responsible freight on the Jinpu route was 340 tons, and on the Jinghu Huhangyong route, it was 140 tons. In the ten days since then, the Jinpu route has increased to 2,510 tons, and the Jinghu Huhangyong route has increased to 2,580 tons. Generally, shippers have sent letters requesting the two routes to actively expand the responsible measures, praising them. This shows the urgent need for responsible transportation for general shippers. From this, we can imagine what the result will be if the entire station of the two routes is fully implemented, and then imagine what the result will be if all routes across the country are fully implemented. We can resolutely say that after all routes are uniformly implementing responsible transportation in the future, responsible combined transportation, water and land combined transportation, and international combined transportation can be organized. At that time, the national industry and commerce will inevitably develop day by day, and the social economy will inevitably become more and more developed. Only then will the railway truly fulfill its mission.</p>
<p>A small number of merchants and a small number of forwarding companies inevitably have suspicions about responsible transportation due to special relationships. This is really because they have not clearly understood the true face and spirit of responsible transportation, and they have not taken a long-term view. We need to think thoroughly about how our industry and commerce have reached this point of decline, and how the people's livelihood has reached this dangerous period. We have no other way to save it but to seek a way out from reform and construction. We should not forget the long-term interests of the future because of past habits or current interests. Responsible transportation is to seek permanent solutions for general shippers, and to seek permanent solutions for the national economy and people's livelihood, not just to seek benefits for the railway itself. If the social and economic problems are solved, all industries across the country will naturally benefit. If we only care about our own current small profits, what is the use of asking whether the forwarding industry can survive independently until the railway goes bankrupt and the various industries go bankrupt? If we understand this principle, we naturally don't have to doubt it. Moreover, after the implementation of responsible transportation, the smooth flow of freight transportation and the business of transportation companies will naturally develop day by day, so there is no need to worry too much.</p>
<p>In a word, responsible transportation is the only way to rectify the railway transportation in our country, and it is also the fundamental way to relieve the suffering of the merchants and develop the social economy. All sectors of the country must unite and cooperate to complete this major event. This is the ardent hope of the Ministry, and it is also the ardent hope of the national public.</p>

<h3 id="e112">From China's Current Education to the Establishment of Public Libraries <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Historically, education in China, both past and present, has been almost entirely monopolized by the wealthy class. Before the Qing Dynasty, if you were not from a family with deep roots and ample financial resources, you could not hope to study well, let alone pass the imperial examinations. Because that kind of antiquated education required you to read the Four Books and Five Classics from the very beginning, no matter how hard you worked, the first two or three years were always wasted. At most, you could only recognize a few words, and it was very difficult to apply them to life. Therefore, the poor had no fortune and could only remain ignorant generation after generation. Later, influenced by Western civilization, the system was hastily abolished during the Guangxu reign and replaced with school education. The original intention was to popularize education, but the reality was quite different. Because politics were not on track, ambitious politicians seized power and used educational institutions as places to cultivate their personal influence and recruit party members. Therefore, the sacred field of education often turned into a base and vile drama, and a distorted phenomenon formed, namely, everyone flocked to the development of higher education and universities, neglecting the basic lower-level education. Therefore, the longer schools were run, the less education was popularized. In contrast, Western countries emphasized lower-level education, and the number of universities in the entire country was not as many as in one corner of Shanghai. Therefore, education in those countries flourished, unlike China's unwieldy and chaotic situation. Furthermore, secondary education in China is becoming increasingly aristocratic and commercialized. Universities are established in large numbers, and secondary schools are like shops in a row. If you open one, I open one. Several can be found on one street. In general, those who run schools, in addition to cultivating personal influence, use this as a guise to profit from it. Tuition and other fees are extremely expensive. Since the goal is so base and vile, the content is naturally not worth mentioning. As long as you have money (袁頭，钞票也可), you can enter casually. Exams are a formality, and teachers are particularly flattering to students. Thinking about the label of "wild chicken schools," you can imagine that there are often dramas of randomly recruiting students. Under this kind of education system, if you are not a wealthy class with ample property, you cannot step into the gates of a secondary school, let alone dream of entering a university, because there are two invisible signs hanging there: "School area, the poor are not allowed to enter." In fact, your fate is determined in this way. The enjoyment of higher education and the exploration of profound theories are the exclusive rights of the wealthy class. The poor have no share and can only remain detached from learning like gazing at the ocean and sighing. Therefore, I want to find a way to remedy this, namely, to establish public libraries, so that the poor who are eager to learn but have no money to go to school can also have some opportunities to study on their own under the pressure of life.</p>

<p>People say that West Lake is most beautiful in spring, but I love suburban outings in the cool autumn. The jade plate (moon) has not yet fallen, and I still doubt it is summer. The golden millet is just beginning to contain (seeds), and I am beginning to feel autumn. Snowy lotus roots and green water chestnuts are good for side dishes. Cloud pines and purple chestnuts each form a ball. At this time, I alone embrace the moon over the calm lake, and the rushing tide flows against the current.</p>

<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>Ink existed in our country about three thousand years ago. In the West, Egypt also had ink made from coal and oil very early. In the eleventh century, someone made ink using a compound of tannic acid and iron. However, its quality was not as good as today's ink. As for the ink we use now, it is the result of long-term research by many scholars, and it was improved about seventy-three years ago by a person named Lienhard.</p>
<p>Ink Making Method: The most important chemicals are tannic acid and ferrous sulfate. Originally, ink could be made with just these two chemicals, but to prevent precipitation and mold, some other chemicals must be added. Moreover, there is a certain amount and many methods. Now the chemicals and amounts are written below:</p>
<p>Tannic acid 23.4 grams, gallic acid 7.7 grams, ferrous sulfate 30.0 grams, hydrochloric acid 2.5 grams, gum arabic 10.0 grams, carbolic acid 1.0 gram, water 1000.0 grams</p>
<p>What is mixed like this is colorless ink, that is, it must wait until after writing to turn black. Therefore, a few grams of aniline must be added, then blue-black ink can be made.</p>
<p>Method for Making Red Ink</p>
<p>The method for making red ink is extremely simple. The chemicals are as follows:</p>
<p>Red dye EOSIN 20 grams, gum arabic 20 grams, alcohol 50 grams, a small amount of carbolic acid, water 1000 grams</p>
<p>Method for Making Purple Ink</p>
<p>Methyl 10 grams, sugar 10 grams, oxalic acid 2 grams, water 1000 grams</p>
<p>Method for Making Ink Remover</p>
<p>Mixing citric acid, tartaric acid, and oxalic acid in equal parts can make ink remover.</p>
<p>Method for Making Ink Remover Powder</p>
<p>If the ink has not dried and you want to remove the words on the paper, the ink remover will lose its function. Therefore, alum, amber, and sulfur must be mixed in equal parts, and then wiped on the paper with silk or cotton to remove the words on the paper.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Suggestions for Improving Women's Clothing <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yu</p>
<p>Men's clothing has already been suggested for improvement by Mr. Zhang Cangsu, but women's clothing, although Mr. Huai Jingcheng has suggested improvements, only improved a portion of the shorts, which is not a thorough solution. Because women's clothing fundamentally needs improvement, and cannot be ignored, therefore, I will list my humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Women's clothing in our country today can be described as the ultimate spectacle of splendor and strangeness. As for non-Chinese and non-Western, also Chinese and also Western, they mostly bring forth the new from the old, and boast of novelty and strangeness. There are also so-called new clothing companies that fuel the trend and actively promote it. The materials must be imported, and the manufacturing method must admire Europeanization, turning our country's inherent silk fabrics into high shelves, resulting in panic of overproduction. On the one hand, it fosters women's extravagant psychology and bad habits, leading to various malpractices such as economic oppression, moral degradation, and family changes.</p>
<p>Taking the clothing materials for summer now as an example, most fashionable women use a kind of gauze silk as thin as cicada wings. This kind of gauze silk comes from Europe and America, and its value is extremely high. Clothes made from it are indeed as light as mist and exceptionally cool,</p>
<p>, but the muscles are exposed, and young people are tempted by them, and thus stray into the wrong path. There are many such people, and nothing is more destructive to morality than this!</p>
<p>Even the commonly worn cheongsam is nothing but a continuation of the old customs of the Manchu Qing Dynasty (because it is the clothing of the banner people, so it is called cheongsam). Under this revolutionary trend, there is no room for it to exist. Moreover, the real cheongsam is still broad and suitable for the body, but the currently popular cheongsam has long been changed to have a slender waist and narrow sleeves, looking unlike anything. How can it be comfortable to wear on the body? In addition, most of its hemlines have no slits, or if they do, they are only two or three inches high, which is equivalent to not having any. Therefore, movement is not convenient, and it is especially difficult to get on and off boats and cars. I remember a woman who was catching a boat in the Huangpu River the year before last. Just as she was about to board the boat, she fell into the river because she was wrapped in the hem of her cheongsam and could not take a big step, and she died instantly. From this point of view, this kind of clothing is more harmful than beneficial! In ancient times, strange clothing was punishable. The clothing worn by women today is considered strange clothing! It can be said to be on the list of punishable items!</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, women's clothing should be improved. As for the degree of improvement, in my opinion, it may be based on the old-fashioned dress as a standard, and with careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages, so that the women of the whole country, with their tops and skirts, tend to be consistent. Wearing them will not feel inconvenient, and there will be no danger of falling. In terms of appearance, it is also quite dignified and generous, without being inelegant at all. In terms of material selection, the government should issue a clear order to promote and limit the use of domestic silk fabrics, and absolutely prohibit the use of foreign goods, so that domestic goods can be sold well and the leakage can be stopped. Whether it is appropriate or not, please submit it to all members for common discussion, and I hope for it very much.</p>
<p>A Tragic Scene</p>
<h3 id="e117">Aunt <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>When I heard that my aunt had passed away from this world, I was in a daze of sorrow for several days!</p>
<p>I thought of her gray hair, her pale face, her soft palms, her simple and clean house and bedroom. Everything that my mind could remember, everything about my aunt, I thought of it all! When I thought of all these things, it was as if I had lost something in my soul, and it was extraordinarily uncomfortable and empty!</p>
<p>Having lost my mother before I was four years old was truly very pitiful and pitiable! I think, if there had not been someone like my aunt to raise me at that time, I really don't know what kind of person I would have become! I think, if I can still say that I have a little intelligence now, then it is clearly given to me by my dear aunt. At the same time, I believe that if I have a recognition of "love," then it was also only given to me by my aunt. Besides my approachable aunt, who else has ever given me a kind look!</p>
<p>What contrasts very well with this is my uncle's violence! Although he died the second year after I came to his house, the scenes of him often, after drinking alcohol, venting his anger on me as a vent, will forever, like a poisonous snake, bite into my heart, and I will never forget them no matter what!</p>
<p>"You jinx, who wants you to come to my house? Your mother has already been killed by you (I heard that my horoscope is very strong, and my mother was killed by my strong destiny), your family has already been broken up by you, and now you want to break up our family too? You jinx! ... Jinx! ..."</p>
<p>Such venomous and fierce curses often made me cry and cry; although my aunt gently pulled me to her side or to the kitchen, using gentle words to comfort me, my uncle's curses would still continue. Sometimes he would use a threatening tone, saying, "If you cry again! ... If you don't stop crying! ... You crying jinx! ... I really have to beat you to death! ,</p>
<p>...", often scaring me so much that I dared not cry out but coughed uncontrollably!</p>
<p>Really, in those days when I had lost my own mother, and my father had no choice but to work as a hired worker for his own livelihood and was unable to raise me, my aunt was able to raise me regardless of my uncle's complaints. This truly makes me yearn for her more and more!</p>
<p>I think my aunt loved me so much perhaps because she had no children of her own! When I was studying in elementary school, she always encouraged me: "A Ling, you must study hard! For your poor father, for your broken family, for your future career!" At that time, I was petted like a docile lamb, and I went to school to study every day without stopping! Although my body is very weak now, I don't dare to complain about her teaching me to be so docile. Especially when the semester exams were over and I returned home with the prizes I had won, my aunt would always hold me tightly, desperately caressing my face! Her happy smile contained clear and bitter tears! Sometimes she would suddenly ask me:</p>
<p>"A Ling, when you grow up and become successful, will you still remember your aunt?" When I replied loudly and playfully, "I will," she would laugh heartily.</p>
<p>"You must remember, A Ling."</p>
<p>Sometimes she would be so happy that she would be in a daze, holding my hands tightly, her eyes looking up at the sky, as if that distant future would definitely have a beautiful and happy situation! After she came out of her daze, she would passionately hug me, kiss me, and caress me!</p>
<p>But now? She was squeezed to death by a life of poverty. All the hopes and desires she had yearned for in her life were ultimately destroyed under the iron heel of reality! Therefore, when she took her last breath, she was also full of tears. Alas! How cruel and tragic this is!</p>
