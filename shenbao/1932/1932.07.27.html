<h3 id="c1">歐洲對美之挑戰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（上）　彬·</p>
<p>｜洛桑公約簽字後國際情勢之轉捩</p>
<p>歷盡波折與艱難的洛桑會議。經全歐各國的政治家外交家亘三週餘之焦盧苦思爭論與商討。在本月九日總算已經簽定了一般人所認爲『打破了賠償問題的大難關開世界經濟復興的先河』的『洛桑公約。』</p>
<p>這公約究竟肯定了一些什麽呢。換言之。他究竟是否解决了賠償問題呢。。</p>
<p>檢查公約的本質。第一·把德國爲大戰的戎首這一罪狀撤銷了。第二·把依照楊格計劃德國所應付出的三百五十萬萬馬克的鉅數。减至三十萬萬馬克。</p>
<p>而且等到三年以後。德國金融信用恢復的時候才付出。作爲歐洲善後基金。。</p>
<p>這在德國當然可以説是討得了一些便宜。同時賠欵問題也可以説是已經獲得了可能解决的途徑。</p>
<p>然而在此一『肯定』之後。接着又來了一個『否定。』這一『否定。』便是所謂</p>
<p>英法意比四國的『紳士協定。』紳士協定的主要内容。是協定的四國在没有把他們各自的戰債解决以前不批准洛桑公約。這即無異於説非等美國勾銷全部的戰債。洛桑公約也不能履行。這裏還有一個更深刻的作用在。假如美國不肯勾銷戰債。洛桑公約不能履行的責任。便應歸美國負荷。所以四國紳士協定。不僅是否定了洛桑公約。同時亦即爲歐洲形成一個聯合。公然向美挑戰。</p>
<p>本來自從一九一八年歐戰結束。凡爾賽和約成立以後。美國挾其對歐洲的。爲一百五十六億金元的鉅大的戰債。透過凡爾賽和約。實際上已征服了整個的歐洲。大戰以後。歐洲各國無異成了十四名紐約華爾街的銀行家所代表的美國帝國主義者的外庫。道威斯計劃與楊格計劃産生。更使此外·庫獲得充分的保障。德國的資源關税·以至全德六千萬人民的經濟生活。固都已爲美國所掌握支配。即其他各國如英如法如意等國。因爲戰後的凋敝仰賴美國金元的貸予。亦不能不屈服於美國之前。順受其支配。假如我們説在歐戰中。美國是以軍事勢力作基礎。在柏森哥指揮之下。在歐洲獲得了堅固的地位。那末·我們更不得不承認在歐戰後。美國是以金元勢力爲基礎。在道威斯計劃與楊格計劃支配之下。對歐洲獲得第二次勢力之擴張。</p>
<p>美國的金元勢力就在這樣的情勢之下。透過凡爾賽和約。透過國際銀行。。</p>
<p>支配了歐洲的政局十多年。</p>

<p>學生應如何利用暑假</p>
<p>（一）　王孝英·</p>
<p>（一）暑假的意義</p>
<p>在氣候非常炎熱的夏天、無論設備得怎樣好的課堂、總無以避酷暑的威𦦨、尤其是在每天的中午時間、高溫度的空氣、窒悶得人昏昏欲睡、再也振不起精神、晚上的燈火已不可親、更難自習、所以這裏確實需要一個短時期的假期｜｜暑假、然而暑假的意義、並不是説學生的學業、在暑假中間、便可以完全輟棄、而只是説在此溽暑中、學生從學校回家、生活的調節、得以比較自由决定、</p>
<p>（二）今年的暑假</p>
<p>今年的暑假、更値得我們注意、上海的日軍尙未完全撤退、東三省的義勇軍也正在炎日之下和日帝國主義拚命、熱河目前又告警、而且去年的水災、尙未平復、眼前是一幅悽厲慘絶的『流民圖』國難如斯、民苦如斯、我們在此暑假中、更何容獨樂其樂、長日優遊、</p>
<p>而且、目前全國人民百分之八十以上没有讀書的機會、失學的青年、觸目皆是、我們能在數萬人中爭得一個讀書的機會、不能説不是十分幸運、因此、我們絶不容辜負這個機會、也就不容輕易地度過了當前暑假的大好時光、</p>
<p>（三）利用暑假的計劃</p>
<p>在暑假中、我們應該做些什麽呢、在下面我擬定一個大綱、各個人、可以估量可能的限度、去規定自已的計劃、</p>
<p>Ａ研究學術方面、首先要提到研究學術、當然、已有的知識、我們絶不能使牠從記憶中消逝、而新的研究、也應當加强記憶的深度、並使死板的記憶、化爲活動的體系、在研究的方法上、要取兩個相反的途徑、而實是整個研究歷程之各半、卽是、一·拿故有的知識來解説現實、再二·從現實的探究中求得新的理論、至於研究的範圍、也可略分爲二、</p>
<p>（甲）關於自然科學、如榖物、和家禽的研究、風暴、季節、雨、山洪、冰、雹、隕石、的研究、改良種子和肥料的研究、土壤的研究、驅除病蟲的研究、防疫的研究、天災造因的研究、特産和土製品的研究····等等、舉凡周遭的一切、都可應用爲研究自然科學的材料、</p>
<p>（乙）關於社會科學者、世界經濟恐慌、與洛桑、軍縮等會議的研究、蘇聯五年計劃與文化政策的研究、日本的研究、東北問題的研究、農村經濟的研究、水利和水患的研究、風俗習慣以及各地文化的研究、災區情况的研究、内地交通的研究、以及學潮研究等、須注意到一切社會現象之間、均有互相影響互相激變的關聯、日常閲讀報章雜誌、並考察附近發生的特别事故、如自殺搶案之類、探究各種的原因和結果、使能了解現存社會的本質、由此而準備將來置身於社會的時候、去怎樣地决定臻進社會福利所應取的方針、</p>
<p>Ｂ修養身心方面　青年學生、正常血氣方剛的氣候、在修養身心的方面、也應該特别注意、惡劣的習慣、和傳染的病毒、同樣地是賊害社會的大敵、我們要嚴防其結合在我們的身心之上、</p>

<p>曁南大學護校運動</p>

<p>該校各院系學生、互推出代表、於二十四日在該校第一院開臨時代表大會、當卽决議、由該校全體同學組織學生護校運動會、以執行并實現護校之任務、乃訂期於昨日（二十五日）召集全體同學大會、亦卽學生護校運動會之成立大會、昨日（二十五日）午前八鐘、該校全體同學集合於第一院操場、蘇州中學部亦派代表參加大會乃於火傘高張之下、正式開會、當日所討論及通過之决議、爲（一）該會定名爲國立曁南大學全體學生護校運動會、（二）該會組織以大會爲最高機關、大會閉後、以執委會爲最高機關執委會分總務·組織·宣傳·交際·調查五部·執委人數爲二十一人、候補爲七人、由大中兩部同學中共同選出、執委係對執委會負責、另設一秘書處、向大會負責、（三）發出成立宣言、（四）推派代表賀德府·謝少白·劉荆蔭、馮玉璋、林珠光等五人、携呈文於昨（二十五）晚快車晉京、向行政院敎育部請願、（五）通電全國文化機關及各大中學請求援助、并通電南洋及各地僑胞一致聲援、</p>
<p>又該會定期於二十七日午後二鐘、假本埠威海路中社招待新聞記者、執告該會成立經過及最近工作情形、</p>
<p>大敎授孫寒冰等意見</p>
<p>對朱談話解答頗爲詳盡</p>
<p>整頓敎育須有具體方案</p>
<p>南京大道社記者昨訪曁大法學院長孫寒冰、敎育學院院長郭一岑及敎授張海曙胡秋原於中央飯店、叩以此次行政院對於曁大裁併意見、茲錄其談話如左、此次政府裁併曁大之决議案、是由敎育部長提出、行政院會議通過、同人對於行政院整頓敎育之通令與夫敎長朱家驊氏爲整理全國大學發表之談話、原則上非常贊同、尤其政府對於敎育整頓之苦心、同人更十分諒解、不過旣是整頓全國之大學、似應有一具體方案、予國人以共見、方能收兼籌統顧之效、而在實施上、更應有一定之標準、此係就整頓的一般而言、至於對曁大方面、根據二十四日新京日報朱部長所發表之談話、同人也有幾點意見、（一）</p>
<p>華僑敎育之意義與目的、我們認爲不單是在培植歸國之華僑子弟使其認識祖國之文化與風尙、同時更應造就國内人士向海外發展之人才、我</p>
<p>們認爲後者更比前者重要、根據此點、對於朱部長所謂『有人』説『華僑大學不必要、』認爲未必合理、而對於曁南大學之收取、非華僑子弟之學生、亦并非算錯、至於謂曁南大學之設立、其</p>
<p>目的是爲酬庸效勞祖國之華僑、當初設立之緣因或是如此、但至現在其目的、其意義總該順應時代需要、進步一點、（二）關於敎法兩院的裁併、在朱部長之意、似此次曁大因滬戰損失、應該緊縮、至於緊縮辦法、便是把法學院併入中、</p>
<p>大、敎育學院、縮爲一系、（原有三系）據該談話中所列理由、我们認爲有幾點誤解、一·大學生修習敎育、并非單爲師資之準備、二·專習敎育之學生畢業後之出路問題、我們認爲是整個敎育之出路問題、决非縮院爲系之辦法所能解决、再查敎育學院設立之意義、由於近代敎育科學之發達、如敎育行政、敎育心理、都已自成一個研究的系統、决非一系所能包括、就我國之需要而言、更有重視敎育科學之必要、蓋敎育之所以破産、固係整個社會問題、然而敎育行政人才之缺乏、與夫敎育方法之無知、也顯然是一個重大原因、關於法學院、同人之意見、也與朱部長稍有不同、一·朱部長説、南京國府所在、政治實施、悉起於此、此點與法學院之歸併、有何關係、我們頗不明瞭、不敢妄測、大學敎育、本非完全、限於應用方面、而於專門學者之造成、更爲重要、比方拿經濟系來講、設在全國金融中心之上海、似較首都爲佳、就是法律系著名法學家和律師、住在上海的亦比較多、所以法學院應否設在首都、頗成疑問、再就裁併的原則上説、依朱部長所説同一區域内、院係重複者歸併、但是結果則恰得其反、查上海國立大學、除曁大外、并無敎育學院及法學院、反之、曁大已有設立已久之商學院、這次忽又在上海新設一獨立商學院、豈非重複、至於説曁大必須採取緊縮與集中政策、以期無減敎育之效率、何謂『中』、如何『集』該談話未曾説明、茲就經費方面來看緊縮的效果、亦屬疑問、曁大固可因緊縮而省、同時中大焉得不因澎漲而增乎、、况且曁大法敎兩院雖裁併、而於該兩院之基本科目、如政治經濟等社會科、以及心理學敎學法等科目、仍須設立、仍須相當經費、此外還有一點、就是一個大學這麽大的改革、事先總須與該學校當局磋商一下、倘是等到該校把下年的計劃逐步施行的中途、忽而將其大加更動、則事實是萬分困難的、曁大招生已經快截止了、下年敎授的聘書、也早已發出、這種不顧實際的困難、似乎不不足以表示尊重敎育、整理敎育之至意、我們對於政府、對於朱部長的改革敎育的用意、是　端　成、但希望一方面努力求改革、一方面也該　實際情形、對曁大猶希望能顧到該校事實、妥籌一個良善的辦法、</p>

<p>自由談包辦文化　　中國文化的悠遠盡人皆知，而歐亞學風的同時並茂，吾們也已略略提起。近世以來，中國文化日益凋落，西洋文化，日益向榮，這是什麽原因？説起來一言難盡，但最大的原因要歸根到中外立國之道的不同。中外立國之道確是判若天壤，西洋以拓殖主義立國，中國以閉關主義立國。閉關主義害殺了中華民族，已經是老生長談，吾也説過好幾次，而現在吾又不得不説，實在因爲閉關主義害人害得太苦了。　　你想民國以前，闌入闌出，竟説是犯法，人民連往來旅行都没有自由。其實是專制皇帝自私自利的政策，皇帝想拿全國的人都錮禁起來，死心塌地的服從皇帝，使他們走入閉關的途徑。　　皇帝要百姓死心塌地的過着閉關生活，他絶不願百姓有一些創告造和建設的精神因爲百姓有了創造和建設的精神，皇帝就怕造反，所以維持皇帝運命的儒家替皇帝制一條天經地義：　　『非天子不議禮，不制度，不考文。』　　所謂『禮』『制』『文』那一件不是文化的要素，然而都要天子一個人包辦，中國傳統的心理竟夢想有一包辦文化的皇帝，豈不是一件怪事？　　文化被皇帝一手包辦，於是中國的文化乃如江河之日下，吾想這就是中國文化凋落的大原因。到現在，還有許多人仍想在一種思想的武斷之下，籠照天下，依舊是中了皇帝主義的毒，閉關主義的毒。嫩江之西瓜彈  鄭逸梅　　自古利器必密藏。始足以誅滅仇讐。故劍之於魚腹。匕首之於地圖。俠士之用心。於茲可覩，最近嫩江一役。有所謂西瓜彈者。創聞也。按嫩江在黑龍江。古名難水。將軍馬占山據險以與倭軍抗戰。馬之部下徐寶珍氏。奮勇當先。大敗倭軍。并毁嫩江橋。倭大隊援兵至。仍被擊敗。倭向寗平退却。狼狽不堪。且天氣酷熱。口渴殊苦。徐氏乃異想天開。囑數卒卸其戎服。而易以流氓之衣。各擔西瓜。僞爲負販者。并剜瓜瓤而實以炸彈者凡若干枚。雜置其中。不易辦也。乃繞小道而至敵方。倭軍渴吻不可解。見纍纍西瓜。大喜。攫而聚啖之。正快朶頣。而炸彈爆發。倭軍之貪口腹而喪生者。不知凡幾。徐寶珍聞巨聲砰然。立驅健兒猛力進撲。大刀隊爲左右翼。擒倭軍而以大刀斫之。圓顱滖滖。亦如西瓜之纍纍焉。從此敵方相戒勿啖西瓜。瓜販亦不擔瓜以賣。戄干倭軍之怒。而遭無妄之災也。友人徐紹平見予所撰頣和園之西瓜一文。遂以西瓜彈事見告。紹平蓋聞諸黑山白水間之歸客所談。信而有據者也。蘇州熱屑  孫籌成　　　蘇州最近一旬内。華氏寒暑表升至百度。昨日因公前往。僉謂如是酷熱。向所未有。爰將因熱而發生之瑣聞。摘錄一二如下。　　小販連天呌苦　蘇州之玄妙觀。與南京之夫子廟上海之城隍廟相仿。咸小販林立。游人不絶。蘇俗大家閨秀。每至下午。欲購物品者。咸携僕而赴觀前。親自選擇。其他紳士與青年。則集於三萬昌吳苑等茶肆品茗。以消永書。最近數日。因室中桌椅。亦均發熱。靜坐家内。已汗流如雨。故不敢外出。致路上行人稀少。一般小販無人交易。莫不呌苦連天。　　敎會蹙額愁眉　十九路軍退守第二道防綫後。蘇州城内外設置防禦工程。居民富有者。紛紛遷避。省立蘇州中學等校。在學生星散。曾宣布停課五旬餘。現欲補授是項課程。故今歲暑假少放一月。刻仍照常上課。數十人羣聚一堂。研求學問。熱不可當。兼之因戰事關係。敎員應得之薪水。不特折扣。且須拖欠。身體旣受束縛。經濟又遭打擊。故莫不蹙額愁眉　　公園人山人海　城内以王廢基之公園最寛暢。今歲圖書館北面。又添建一亭。亭畔紛置木凳。以供游人休息。近因白晝驕陽肆威。皆深居簡出。入夜男女聯袂往游公園者。不絶於途。西亭茶肆前。特搭碩大無朋之蘆蓆棚。以出售汽水氷淇淋等冷食。漬水池旁所置露天靠椅。人爲之滿。其他大樹下。茅亭内。荷池旁。以及綠草如茵。席地而坐者。人山人海。夜半始散。　　孝子語無倫次　城南王姓婦。於前月去世。預擇五七開弔。次日出殯。届期儀仗甚盛。親朋咸集。乃子向有嗜好。身體柔弱異常。是日預定路由甚長。因天氣酷熱。執事人等咸須加工。故遂縮短。下午一時發引。兩旁觀者如堵。孝子身穿白衣。且爲孝幔所蔽。空氣不通。中途昏暈。由在旁侍僕竭力施救。雖未殉親。然已危險。舁歸後。時發囈語。越兩日始復元。謔者謂孝子語無倫次。係哀啓上欺人語。不意今乃實行云。識字的貓  影呆　　世界上最聰明而同時並且勇敢的貓，最近竟死掉了，伊产産在暹羅，名字呌比利尼潑賽能夠旘二百個字，伊的主人是摩列師小姐，住在華賽斯德深山中的一個草屋裏面，貓能夠旘字，自然也是一種奇聞啊。隨筆  李季宏　　　三個朋友在炎熱的夏夜明月下談天：『我從此不動聲色了｜』甲説：　　『我已經不動聲色了｜』乙説：　　『嗚嗚嗚』一輛汽車，耀着電光燈駛過，車内一位青春的少女！　　『看｜看｜一個女人｜』丙説：　　『喔？···』甲和乙從丙凳上爬起，跟着汽車在神往目送｜　　『我從此不動聲色了？』丙冷笑着對甲乙説：　　塌車夫拉着沉重的貨車在熱得溶了的柏油路上走｜車輪在柏油裏黏住｜車夫號呌着血汗流着的拼命推，拉｜電車夫，汽車夫踏着铃，按着喇叭在催促｜人們露着笑臉在旁邊參觀，啊｜大衆文藝也？　　一個朋友寫信給我：『我近來總捧了茶壼，吸着烟的朝都市的大道上看摩登姑娘！···没有飯，我還不覺得什麽，没有姑娘，我定會死的！·······我們不應爲藝術而藝術了···不應鑽在象牙塔内高唱戀愛之浪曲了｜我們應該寫些大衆需要的文藝來！····』　　什麽話｜手捧冰淇淋，汽水；寫堂而皇之的『霍亂文章』？抱粉做的姨太太，高唱禁娼｜而内戰，日長期抵抗，忍痛作戰？値得介紹的國貨工廠（十一）  何躬行　　十九軟木塞工廠　　軟木塞、銷路繁多。近代物質文明。製造化妝品食品等工廠林立。無一不需用軟木塞者。上海製這軟木塞工廠。在最近一二年内。開設至二十餘家。社會上需要可知。大者如直隸路之成蓮記。辣斐德路之中國。白爾路之大顧。方浜路之林陳泰。他若興隆等等。　　軟木産於熱帶。及菲洲葡萄牙等處。其銷售我國也以件計。每件重二百磅左右。貨分六等。平均每件市價在五十兩上下。造塞時。有機器。卽名造塞機。全部分三種。一拉。一切。一推。以來路軟木板。用拉機分爲條。再用切機。切成小方。入推機推之。卽成圓形木塞矣。最後入木質搖筒中打光之。推機如舊式推刨然。不過利用輪軸旋轉耳。塞之大小長短。須先在推機上配置模型。（上項三種機件。拉機較大。每部價須一百五十元左右。其他約百元上下。其運用係人力。上海方浜橋。復順昌機廠。專製此項機器。）每機每日可出貨三千五百枚。至四千枚。近有德式機器用馬達者。小者可日出七萬枚。大者可十二萬枚。然現在上海尙無購用者。以設備上須用較大資本也。貨分特頭二三等。每等又分一號至十三號。最賤者每千枚値洋一元。最貴者至十八元。年銷貨品價値在六十萬以上。近年外貨進口幾絶跡矣。　　（二十）餅乾工廠　　餅乾以麵粉爲主要原料。國産者尙可應用。惟欲製上等鬆脆之品。則不得不仰給洋麵。此麥種關係。是須從根本上改良也。　　上海製造餅乾者。以泰豐公司爲第一家。厥後陸續開設。迄今已四五十家矣。中如冠生園泰康邁羅華孚溥利春申大陸等廠。均甚著名者。其資本自一二萬元至三十萬元不等。此外以一二千元之小資本者。居其多數。設灶一二具。鳩工十餘人。每年出品自三四千元至一二萬元不等。其裝璜或用鐵罐。或用紙袋。銷路除本埠外。以江浙兩省爲大宗。價目至不一律。　　製造餅乾除麵粉外。如糖香料颜色藥粉等品。大都係外貨。惟鷄蛋油脂二項。尙係國貨。而奶油則又外貨矣。查泰豐公司。年銷餅乾。一百萬磅。需粉二萬五千包。設合上海各廠計之。洋麵之　銷路殊鉅。况外洋餅乾進口。每年又必在五六十萬元以上耶。　　夫幽燕糕餅。江浙細點。爲我國數千年來固有之特産。其味未必不如餅乾。惜包禁裝璜。守舊不變。至爲國人厭棄。殊可歎也。古廟敲鐘（五六）  不除庭草齋夫　　　六十三　　秋兒問『一年的計畫可是我們從大年初一朝一直到三十晚所要做的事呢』？』朱先生説：『是的。在這計畫裏應該包括各人所要做的事和大家合起來所要做的事。你們看一看我們四周的山，都是秃着頭，好看嗎？有什麽法子呌他不秃頭？』櫻兒説：『秃頭的山不好看，應該栽樹。』朱先生説：『對｜古廟的一年計畫中該列入栽樹。你們算一算每個孩子能栽幾棵樹？若把四山栽滿要育多少樹苗？一共要多少人栽才能把牠們栽滿？我們小朋友能栽幾個山頭？這些問題都要算出來，才能定出一個精確的計晝。山上無樹不但是不好看而且還有許多别的壞處，你们也要慢慢的去研究，今天却没有功夫討論这個。你們看除了栽樹之外還有什麽要緊的事要做呢？下雨天你們到學堂裏來有什麽不方便？』春香説：『下雨路不好走，我前次滑了一跤爬起來，簡直成了一個泥菩薩。我想要把路做得好些。』朱先生説；『造路是我們該做的一件迫切的工作。從前羅馬帝國的軍隊每到一處必造一條大路通到羅馬。我們古廟的學生無論住在那個村莊裏必造一條小路通到古廟。還有别的事嗎？夏天給蚊子叮覺得舒服嗎？』羊兒説：『這該死的蚊子咬得我一晚不能睡。還有那壁蝨喲｜先生，你若有法子把這兩種壞蛋除掉，那我就快樂了。』玉兒説：『我妈妈説：「壁蝨是個木客。木客怕鹽商。只要弄些鹽放在床縫裏就把壁蝨醃死了。』朱先生説：『玉兒的法子，大家可以試試看。我没有經騐不敢保險。總之這壁蝨與蚊子好一比是帝國主義，我們必須打倒他。還有一個東西比壁蝨蚊子更厲害。你們猜是誰？他歡喜在毛厠缸裏玩，玩厭了又飛到你的菜碗裏吃點心。這樣他時常從糞坑裏帶些　來送人吃，呌人吃得吐瀉，甚而至於送命。牠是什麽？』香姑説：『這是蒼蠅｜也要除掉。』朱先生説：『好，從前周處除三害的故事，你們是聽過了。我們現在也要除三害：一除蚊子：二除壁蝨：三除蒼蠅。你們再想想，現在東三省已經被日本軍閥奪去了，小朋友應該怎樣盡你們的小小力量把東三省拿回來？』武兒説：『我們趕快學打拳。』李兒説：『玩科學把戲，發明小炸彈轟他走。』玉兒説：『向爸爸要些錢寄給義勇軍。』朱先生説：『你們講的這些法子都好。但是玉兒的法子我有些懷疑。用爸爸的錢捐給義勇軍只是你爸爸盡的力，不是你盡的力。』玉兒説：『那未，我提議我們每人用自已的勞力赚一些』錢作爲收復東三省之用。』······</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言組織改良社會討論會芻議  嚴夢　　　　　讀了日前本刊組織改良社會討論會小啓之後·發生無窮的感想：丁茲國難日亟·山河變色，而社會問題日趨複雜之秋，改良社會之組織，實在適切時弊刻不容緩的要圖。作者不敏，亦謹貢芻蕘之議，以作諸君子之參考焉！　社會革新，完全是靠先知先覺的志士的努力完成。以激烈之手腕行之，爲求達改善之信仰和目的，於是演成大流血的悲劇也不惜的，那不是革命。例如一般烈士壯言：（大丈夫謀世，不成殉之·」這是慷慨悲歌之士擊劍長鳴的勇氣·　　然而以和平之方法改良，這也是抱有很同情的人們所爲，同樣是爲了大多數人的幸福和社會的進步而已。如今本利登高一呼，我相信這是時的需要，不久就當應者雲集了，這個建議，是國難中的救亡治本問題，對於中國青年思想和社會前途的影響自然是很重大的。不過怎樣組織？怎樣改良？以及怎樣進行？我們就有待於恂恂的社會學者的商榷了·　　我是個不學無術的人，對於社會原有的不良制度和法律道德的不健全，大概都不是草草的一篇短文可以盡情瀝述　，現在單就事實可行方面建議，以冀作愚者之一得罷了　　中國社會目前最壞的現象，是一般青年將有用的精神和身體都不去作生産的事業，而祇知奔競鑽營爲尙。這眞是國運的莫大危機，所以我們常常見到社會上絶大矛盾的事實。譬如某人在野的時候，他的言論大都是神聖的，光明的：可是一旦上了台，他們做壞事的本領就要比平時他們痛駡的政客還要高强。他們的權力不曾用到正當的地方去培養人才，反而將很好的天才也埋没了，摧殘了！　　所以有人説，人生可分爲三個時期：青年的時代要改進社會，中年時代便與社會推移。暮年索性阻止社會的進步而日趨腐化。爲救中國未來的孩子，爲救中國的社會，我們眞要立刻嚴密地組織起來，切實地去研究社會敎育的根本補救方案。擎起光明正義的火把，領導後來的青年走平安的康莊大道。　　要談到如何改良，那更要明顯的指中國社會的病狀與病源，而提出具體的方法去糾正牠的病態，愚昧無知，就得從敎育入手，貧乏落伍，那便非努力生産不可。然而中國社會的當前大敵，實在無過於『宿命』與『名敎』。｜尤其是政治不修明的惡影響·我們覺得要改良中國社會，他的功能不是靠口號，標語和演説，而端賴埋頭埋腦的幹。我們雖以最和平之心緖爲之，但都必須具有大無畏的精神，堅毅的坦白心懷｜　　領袖慾和權利慾一點也不能存在。有時候，我們會被誣爲公敵，受得了嗎？惟一介不苟取，方可與言社會改良｜青年們，别再沉淪了，中國正待意志很强的青年們的奮起，頂天立地的男子漢，誰不可做個感天地而泣鬼神的甘地？改良社會討論會怎樣改良社會婚喪制度  金煥　　（説明）誰都知道在現在的一個社會裏，不論做一椿喜事，一椿喪事，上等些，總要化上幾千塊錢，中下等些，也得要化上幾百塊錢才夠，在農村經濟這樣的衰落時代，小小的一家人家，豈不是要爲了一椿喜事，一椿喪事，負了一大筆的債務嗎？『哭笑不得』，在這畸形的社會裏，正多着呢｜因此鄙人特提出了這個問題，貢諸大家討論，怎樣的來改良這婚喪制度，去解决社會的民生。　　現在把我個人對於婚喪制度的意見，發表如下：　　（婚事）婚事根本要廢除賣買式的金錢制度，在訂婚的當兒，只須簽一張婚約，經雙方親長證明，到了結婚的時候，新夫婦只消在親長證明，監察之下，舉行宣誓典禮，事後，再登報遍告知好親朋，廢除一切餽贈，筵席等虚僞消耗，這樣，恐怕也不算是不鄭重，不正當，况且結婚那件事，是人人所必須經過的，（特别的人除外）一些也没有什麽大驚小怪，這樣一來，（一）可省去主客兩方的無謂消耗，（二）可把這筆費用做生産的資本，再滑稽一些的説，也可免受摩登女子，今日結婚，明日離婚的影響，而損失鉅大財資。　　（喪事）人孰不有死，不過死得「得當」與「不得當」「可惜」與「不可惜」罷了，那未對於「得當」的「可惜」的，只要紀念他的精神，繼續他的遺志，或者範圍擴大一些的話，那末就舉行一個追悼會，或出一本紀念刊物就便得了，根本用不着，開弔，出喪，素車，白馬，來出死風頭，甚至「招妓女以侑酒，舉游藝而娛賓，」這種矛盾的事情，不但損費錢財，同時還要給人家大駡呢｜并且鄉間還有一種陋俗，譬如人家死了人，那親里鄰朋，總是光臨闔第，他們拿幾串長錠的代價，換得一家大小三頓的口糧，這樣的鉅大消費，眞是累死人也死不起呢｜　　現在鄙人特地具了些意見，供給大家參考，是否有當，還祈公决！　　改良婚姻制度案永　　（理由）　中國現在的婚姻制度，在新舊潮流互相衝突之下，所演的悲劇，實不忍目覩，如情死案，情殺案，爲了婚姻不自由而逃婚者，賴婚者，逼婚者，自殺者，見聞多矣，在這種潮流的婚姻制度之下，舊式婚姻固不滿意，而自由戀愛，亦不足取，故婚姻制度之在今日，實有改良之必要。　　（原則）（一）以節約爲原則，因爲現代的婚姻，不論男婚女嫁，大都故事鋪張，爭擺塲面，不顧自已家庭經濟的實力，如此，則每一次婚嫁以後，男女雙方，均受經濟上的重大損失，以致負債中落，甚至於破産，拆穿説一句，實在是没有多大意義，嚴格説來，可説是毫無意義，故婚姻亦須以節約爲原則　　（二）以雙方同意爲原則　婚姻如以媒妁撮合的，亟應徵求男女雙方本人的同意，如以自由戀愛而成者，亦應徵求各該家長的同意，因家長老成持重，經騐豐富徵求之當不致吃虧　　（三）改强迫爲指導　中國舊式婚姻，往往由家長一手包辦，兒女絶對没有過問權，只有服從的義務，如此强迫辦理，致兒女前途幸福於不顧，實屬不合，自後爲家長者，應改强迫爲指導。　　（四）禮物應有限制，中國婚嫁爲親友者，必送禮物，以示恭賀之意，其意亦未始不善，惟禮物亦應有相當限制，不宜過多過奢，俾不致影響個人經濟。　　（五）應儘量用國貨　中國婚姻制度上有所謂嫁粧者，考其來源，大都洋資，而尤以衣料爲最，嗣後應力糾是弊，在可能範圍以内，絶對不用外貨，俾利權不致外溢。　　（辦法）　（甲）關於節約方面者應由各地指導民衆機關，組織婚嫁節約會，以資提倡。　　（乙）關於男女本身者　應請雙方婚姻介紹人，特别注意。家長及本人，亦應特别注意。　　（丙）關於指導方面者　應由各地民衆敎育機關，組織婚姻指導所，民衆有關於婚姻上的問題，亦可就近向民衆敎育機關請求指導，而民敎機關，應請學識經騐豐富者，主持是項組織。　　（丁）　關於送禮方面者　各地青年同志，可發起一婚嫁節約會，會中規定婚嫁送禮標準，俾不致侈奢，加入斯會者，應絶對遵守。　　（戊）關於提倡國貨方面者　應由各地學校公所，敎育機關，加以宣傳指導，并請行政機關出示公告，勸大家購用國貨！如有不遵守者，可定懲戒法以懲戒之，如完全用國貨者，行政機關亦予以奬勵。　　以上數項，皆爲鄙人思慮之所及，顧遺漏及不詳之處頗多，希望同志們大家來討論來研究。新到貨色括括呌，旣是便宜又是好，特别洋盤大學店，拍賣暑期學士帽。  佛題文藝爲閑華覓殯舍於羊婆墩  洪荆山　　落日青山悵獨行。一懷難了百年心。亦如神理隨形盡。叵奈覊愁與日深。遠浦歸魂如有待。殘宵短夢試重尋。白頭偕隱成虚願。凄絶羊墩近故林。三月四日載閑華枢渡海歸葬　　歲歲羈留爲治裝。一棺共載太凄凉。怒潮撼夢關山黑。殘夜招魂島嶼蒼。但覺歸舟成獨往。尙從遺掛覓餘芳。沈沈影事分明在。法　何時共道塲。科学衣服的清潔法（續）  譚冠翰　　　我們赴宴的當兒，肉汁常會膏吻着我們的衣服，所幸也有方法除掉它，先把被汚的部分，用苛性鉀細細洗滌，再在清水裏漂凈絞乾，將兩頁吸水紙，舖置於被汚部分的上下方，然後用燙斗在紙上烘擦，俟水分吸乾，汚跡也不見了，倘若沾染了茶汁，却分作兩部整理，（一）白衣服可在熱水裏搓洗，或用漂白法更佳，（二）顔色衣服便要用微溫的水裏滌凈，或用硼砂水洗濯亦可。　　墨水汚了衣服，誰也會用飯搓揉，其實除了飯，西瓜子的肉嚼爛塗上擦之，功效更大呢，假使遭染了顔色的墨水，倒是困難的工作，但也不然，（如紅綠等色）我們可先用羢布或海綿吸取酒精洗擦，再用潔凈牙刷蘸阿母尼亞水徐徐揩拭，最後把過　酸鉀液（成分｜過　酸鉀三瓦，水三○○立）和酸性亞硫　鈉液（成份｜酸性亞硫酸鈉二瓦，水三○○立）漂洗，晒乾後，汚跡自消滅。　　天雨的時候，在馬路間行走，往往遇着泥漿由車馬的輪軸飛轉而輸送到我們的衣服上，未始不失雅觀，但是，遇着這種欠適的事情時，我們不要着急，勿把濕布將它揩抺，因爲泥漿一經水分，不但不能消滅，反將汚點的範圍擴大，更碍觀瞻，所以，我們首先非要鎭靜不可，忍耐底等它乾燥後‘才把鈍刀輕輕刮去泥團，再用衣刷刷去它的遺痕，這樣，便能得到滿意了。　　新開張的商店，少不了要裝飾一番，粉刷呀，油漆呀······我們倘若經過其地，五彩的漆液，或者會垂愛我們的衣服而黏附着它的上面，像私奔底被我們帶到家來，但是，誰喜歡它呢，於是我們不免又要勞苦一回，把它遣散了，在未動手之先，我們須先明白漆的成分，它是用煮沸過的阿麻仁油和鉛粉而鍊成的，所以‘我們先要用鈍刀把它的最上層慢慢刮去，再塗些松節油，待它所含的乾性油溶解，並使鉛粉游離，俟乾後，用毛刷揮去白色粉跡，再搽些揮發油，汚點便自然而無踪影了。天理昭彰  士本　　他是一個色中餓鬼，時常在幹那異性的追求，雖則家中有着如花似玉的美貌妻子，可以來供他肉的狂歡，但是他是一個素來喜新厭舊的人物，並且抱着（家花不比野花香）的主義，所以在旁人</p>

<p>看來足彀他性的揮霍的矯妻，也不過是算他的常備的工具，　　本來在上海要暢達性的需要，是很極端的便利的，只要你腰包中麥克麥克，隨時隨地可以有精選的貨品來供給你的，　　北朱家橋，是肉的集團，也是上海最神秘的性大陸，今天他從公司裏回來，坐在二路電車上，心中默默的想，有好幾天没有幹野花的追求，所以精神上覺得有些萎頓了，時間還早，不妨到性大陸一遊，以舒身心上的煩悶，車到黄金大戲院門前，他就下落電車，三脚兩步地向目的地前進，　　他踏進了肉的市場的×莊，專門爲人行方便，尤其痴男怨女所最崇拜，是感戴的人間月老王大娘，笑嘻嘻地上前殷勤招待，並説『謝先生，｜這兩天怎麽不來，難道碰着吃素嗎？』　　『素到不吃，只有嘗着家常便飯，野味兒倒眞的齋戒幾天了，弄得胃口呆倒了，所以今天特地跑來補救補救，你快點去和我揀一個上等的新鮮貨來，待我開開胃口，』他説畢，一張包滿色素的臉上，顯着緊張的情緒，似乎在要求王大娘馬上去發那動員命令。　　不到數分鐘，　外面送進一股帶着重性誘惑的迷人的香氣，接着一陣清脆的皮鞋得得聲音，他抬頭一望，看見王大娘同着一個花枝招展的美麗女子進來，在極短的時間中，他已評判了她，的確是一個上等的西洋道地貨，當即表示萬分的滿意，王大娘介紹之後，作一度的貨價談判後，就去表演肉的藝術。　　他和她正在精精有味地，突飛猛進地，演那張博士發明的第×種×的時候，猛然聽得隔壁房裏，傳來一聲很熟的（啊唷唷）的聲音，他再側耳靜聽了一回，覺悖然大怒，立時停止工作，下落性舞臺，倉倉皇皇地跑過去，打門入内，見赤裸襟一對肉彌陀，也在表演肉的藝術，他見了，不由的眼中火拼，突然上前一把揪住那女角色，拳頭像雨點般的照她打去，並且嘴裏惡狠狠地發出嚴厲的詰問，『賤人｜你倒好，到這裏來幹這不知廉恥的勾當，今天碰得巧，被我撞破，要你的命了，···』　　『我未在這裏做這種不知廉恥的行爲，你來做怎麽？···難道只許州官放火，不許百姓點燈，男女的需要，是一樣的，假使只有男的可以滿足私慾，那嗎，你弄的女人，從那裏來呢，你的妻子，供給了人家，你就動武，那嗎，供給你的女子，也是人家的妻子，難道你是領了派司，有的特殊權利啊，哼哼，男偷婆娘女偷漢，這種是應該的報應啊，』　　原來他揪住的女角色，正是他的妻子，也是一個常常進出×莊的人物，今天看見丈夫到了鐘點，還不回來，曉得他去追逐異性了，自已不妨也去作異性的追逐，天判他們夫婦巧遇，她一跑也跑到王大娘家裏，王大娘是只認得謝先生，謝師母是不認得的，况且她向來進出，恐被王大娘聲張出去，所以移名換姓，今天她不曉得丈夫也在這裏，所以胆大而來，那知演到中間，突被丈夫來捉住，好在一眼看見丈夫也是從房裏出來，身旁站着另一女性，就知道丈夫也在幹這種勾當，頓時胆壯了百倍，馬上發着上面這樣有理的反抗聲浪。　　『唔唔唔····』他給他的妻子一席話説得閉口無言。市場訊　　福利公司夏季大减價　南京路四川路轉角福利公司、舉行夏季大减價，將所有英法及美國全部貨品、一律削價出售、　　　　　折不等、全部貨品、皆係應時新貨、歡迎各界士女參觀　　公佈欄　　上海第一特區地方法院　　刑事第一審判决　匯山捕房訴張士恒等鴉片案張士恒王自愼張壽山張嵩林持有鴉片一罪各處罰金三十元張寶根田汝海無罪鴉片烟具照單没收▲老閘捕房訴雷李氏鴉片案雷李氏持有鴉片一罪處罰金二十元鴉片没收▲老閘捕房訴周菊寶持有鴉片案周菊寶持有鴉片罪處罰金三十元鴉片没收▲老閘捕房訴趙許氏鴉片案趙許氏持有鴉片一罪處罰金二十五元鴉片没收▲老閘捕房訴田文生鴉片案田文生持有鴉片代用品一罪處罰金三十元紅丸等没收▲老閘捕房訴梁馬氏鴉片案梁馬氏持有鴉片一罪處罰金五十元鴉片没收▲老閘捕房訴陳新保持有鴉片案陳新保持有鴉片一罪處罰金二百元鴉片没收▲虹口捕房訴張長白竊盜案張長白竊盜一罪處拘役三十日▲新閘捕房訴朱海泉竊盜案朱海泉竊盜一罪處拘役三十日戈登路捕房訴王才龍等鴉片案王金氏吸食鴉片一罪處徒刑三月前科徒刑二月緩刑二年之宣告撤銷應合併執行徒刑四月王才龍持有鴉片一罪處罰金十元烟具照單没收▲新閘捕房訴曹阿二竊盜案曹阿二竊盜一罪處徒刑四月▲匯司捕房訴徐子明搶奪案徐子明搶奪一罪處有期徒刑三個月裁判確定前羈押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲總巡捕房訴高金生强盜案高金生給夥三人强盜累犯處有期徒刑五年六月裁判確定前羈押日數以二百抵徒刑一日▲孫紹增與戚日棟等傷害案本件不受理▲新閘捕房訴尤學沂侵占案尤學沂共同侵占一罪處拘役四十日裁判確定前羈押日數以二日抵拘役一日▲公共租界會審公廨訴王才明强盜再核案王才明携帶兇器結夥强盜二罪每罪處有期徒刑六年執行徒刑八年判决確定前在監日以執行刑期論▲公共租界會審公廨訴趙　平等强盜再核案趙　平王華亭携帶兇器結夥强盜一罪各處有期徒刑七年判决確定前在監日數以執行刑期論▲戈登路捕房訴周其友過失殺人案周其友因業務上過失致人於死一罪處罰金三百元經强制執行而未完納以二元折易監禁一日裁判確定前羈押日數以一日抵金一元▲公共租界會審公廨訴胡文有殺人未遂再核案胡文有意圖爲犯罪之用而持有軍用槍砲子彈一罪處有期徒刑二年六月意圖免犯罪之處罰而犯殺人未遂一罪處有期徒刑七年執行徒刑八年判决確定前在監日數以執行刑期論▲公共租界會審公廨訴孫喜明持有軍用槍彈案孫喜明意圖爲犯罪之用而持有軍用槍砲子彈一罪處有期徒刑二年六月判决確定前在監日數以執行刑期論▲公共租界會審公廨訴沈阿四等强盜案沈阿四洪六生李和和携帶兇器結夥强盜各一罪各處有期徒刑七年判决確定前在監日數均以執行刑期論▲戈登路捕房訴張子卿侵占案張子卿王阿四共同侵占業務上持有物各減處有期徒刑三月裁判確定前羈押日數以二日抵徒刑一日項福青無罪▲總巡捕房訴周開丙竊盜案周開丙以竊盜爲常業未遂累犯處有期徒刑一年二月裁判確定前羈押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲新閘捕房訴梅如起傷害案梅如起傷害人身體處有期徒刑二月裁判確定前羈押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲匯司捕房訴包里沙夫妨害公務案包里沙夫妨害公務一處徒刑四月▲李薪傅傳等訴盛潤清詐欺侵占案盛潤清無罪附帶民事訴訟移送民庭審理▲總巡捕房訴張孟興竊盜案張孟興竊盜罪處拘役二十日▲老閘捕房訴吳兆富等竊盜案吳兆富結夥三人竊盜累犯處有期徒刑二年六月楊如　結夥三人竊盜處有期徒刑一年二月裁判確定前羈押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日▲戈登路捕房訴朱旗狼强姦案朱旗狼意圖姦淫和誘未滿二十歲之女子脱離監獲人一罪處有期徒刑一年六月裁判確定前羈押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲杜杏寶訴畢尺瑚妨害風化案本件不受理▲公共租界會審公廨訴葛長根擄人勒購再核案潘長根帮助擄人勒贖一罪處有期徒刑六年判决確定前在監日數以執行刑期論▲公共租界會審公廨訴田阿見等擄人勒贖等案再核田阿見擄人勒贖一罪處有期徒刑十三年金宏臣顧高漢尹濱興擄人勒贖各一罪各處有其徒刑十年張子萬陳阿毛張元根帮擄人勒贖各一罪各處有期徒刑七年劉林仙意圖犯罪之用　持有爆裂物一罪處有期徒刑二年六月判决確定前在監日數均以執行刑期論▲匯山捕房訴何鏡梅等鴉片案何鏡梅吸食鴉片處有期徒刑二月裁判確定前羈押日數以二日抵徒刑一日緩刑二年沙耀文吸食鴉片累犯處有期徒刑三月裁判確定前羈押日數以二日抵徒刑一日烟具等照單没收▲公共租界會審公廨訴李大喜子等强盜案李大喜子顧小鍋子携帶兇器結夥强盜二罪每罪處有期徒刑六年執行徒刑十年王小四子携帶兇器結夥强盜二罪每罪處有期徒刑五年執行徒刑八年判定確前在監日數均以執行刑期論　　民事第一審判决　馬肇成與孫志良貨欵案被告應清償原告貨欵銀六百七十五兩七錢三分九厘訴訟費用被告負担史全餘等與葛賢蔽保債案被告應債還原告史金餘銀二百元又償還原告炘元賢本銀五百元及自民國十六年六月二十一日起至本年七月四日止按月一分五厘之利息原告其餘訴訟駁回訴訟費用由原告史全餘負担十六分之四原告炘元賢負担十六分之五其餘由被告負担▲陳旭升與友寗森記汽車公司等欠租案被告等應連帶給付原告租金一千零四十元又自本年六月二十二日起至七月二十一日租金洋一百三十元訴訟費用由被告負担十分之九原告負担十分之一原告其餘之訴及假執行之聲請均駁回▲丁鄧季華與上海華興水火保險公司賠債案原告之訴駁回訟費由原告負担▲褚富生與盧楊氏確認身分案確認原告與被告無親屬關係訟費由被告負担食旦與成立興屋記吳少五票欵案被告應償還原告銀五百兩並自民國二十年十二月十五日起至償還之日止週年五釐之利息訟費由被告負担▲周福田與沈子勤等執行異議案被告周開泰徐釗佩所欠被告沈子勤之欵不得就原告所設福記清華池浴堂與壟龔哲甫返還保單案被應將原告出給周開甲一千元之保單交還原告訟費由被告負担▲白利東生與張潤生等借欵案被告張潤生應償還原告洋三百元此欵限每月拔還三十元還清爲止如不能償還由被告沈養記陳和富連帶代爲償還訟費由張潤生負担▲盧子慶與季鳳清等同居案被告季鳳清與原告同居原告其餘之訴駁斥訟費由被告季鳳清負担▲沙唯一等與上海華商紗布交易所爲確認議决無效案被告就第一五一二號揭示所爲之决議宣告無效訟費由被告負担▲陸恊邦與錢周氏欠租及遷讓案被告應償還原告洋二百元並於判决日起一個月内遷讓出屋到期如不遷讓本案尙未確定時於遷讓部分應予假執行原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告負担九分之八原告負得九分之一▲佑尼干與莊全福欠租等案被告應將白克路懷德里二一三號房屋交還原告接收並償還原告房租洋一百七十四元訟費由被告負担▲忠記經租賬房顧良忠與華海記欠租等案被告應償還原告房租洋三百八十五元並准原告與被告解除租約令被告遷讓出屋又確認原告對於被告置於所租屋内之動産有留置權訟費由被告負担本件關於遷讓部分予假執行▲陳瑞卿與徐富根等欠欵案被告徐富根應清償原告貨欵銀八千九百五十元零四角五分又票欵銀一千八百元上開貨欵如徐富根不能清償時應由被告張振興號東於銀四千零四十二元六角九分之限度内負代還之責原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由原告負担二十分之一被告徐富根負担二十分之十五被告張振興號東負担二十分之四▲泰利有限公司經租金畊舜與萬康醬園等欠租案被告萬康醬園應償還原告洋六百五十一元又小洋八十四角被告萬康三米號應償還原告洋三百三十三元又小洋三十六角被告朱貢禹應償還原告洋二百二十元零五角被告馬文爃應償還原告洋二百十四元五角原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由原告負担十分之四餘由被告等比例負担▲王光前等與趙煜南貨欵案被告應清償原告王光前銀二百十七元零二分六厘王新濤銀四百十七元七角二分朱振元銀四百五十五元零二分八厘訟費由被告負担▲貢元與王熊等欠租案被告王熊應償還原告洋四十八元被告張陸令應償還原告洋四十八元被告劉春應償還原告洋六十元被告尤阿大應償還原告洋三十六元被告朱榮全應償還原告洋四十八元訟費由被告等比例負担▲姚南記與羅甘　欠租案被告應償還原告銀六千九百十七兩並自起訴時起至執行終了時止週年五釐之法定遲延利息又被告應卽遷讓出屋本判决准予假執行訴訟費用由被告負担▲中國煤球廠樂葆庭與源森柴炭號貨欵案被告應償還原告洋三百七十四元八角二分並自民國二十一年六月二十一日起至執行終了日止週年五釐之遲延利息訟費由被告負担▲陳福忠與聞人傑股欵案被告應償還原告股欵洋五百元兩告合夥契約准予解除原告其餘之訴及被告之反訴均駁回本訴訟費原告負担六分之一被告負担六分之五反訴訟費由被告負担▲吳逸仙與蔡榮華等欠租案被告蔡榮華張宏勳張金才王文榮各應償還原告洋一百零三元五角樂寶林忻根楚咨應償還原告洋一百一十三元八角八分趙萬沼應償還原告洋一百二十四元二角原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告等比例負担▲格他生與黄錫青等欠欵案被告黄永福應償還原告洋三百元如不能償還時由被告黄錫青代爲償還訟費由黄永福負担▲戈列脱天司基與勃洛赫欠薪案被告應償還原告洋三百元訟費由被告負担▲鄭徐氏等與陸金山欠欵案被告應償還原告鄭徐氏洋一百元並自民國十八年四月十九日起至償還之日止週年二分之利息被告應償還原告徐祥生洋十五元原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告負担▲姜良生與王國亮等欠欵案被告王國亮應償還原告洋六百元内洋三百元如不能償還時由被告鄔尖才鄔茂根連帶代爲償還訟費由被告王國亮▲同泰永號與合　營業有限公司等保費案原告之訴及假執行之聲請均駁回訴訟費用由原告負担▲度松度松與余志勛欠欵案被告應償還原告洋一百二十元訟費由被告負担▲三　生與錢蘭生等欠欵案被告錢蘭生應償還原告洋三百元内洋二百五十元如不能償還時由被告俞大貴代爲償還原告對於被告俞大貴其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告錢蘭生負担▲　亞格那生與朱桂

<p>(Part 1) by Bin</p>
<p>| A Turning Point in the International Situation After the Signing of the Lausanne Treaty</p>
<p>The Lausanne Conference, after many twists, turns and difficulties, after more than three weeks of anxious and painstaking consideration, debate, and discussion by European politicians and diplomats, finally signed the "Lausanne Treaty" on the 9th of this month, which is generally regarded as "breaking through the major hurdle of reparations and opening up a precedent for world economic recovery."</p>
<p>What exactly does this treaty affirm? In other words, does it really solve the reparations problem?</p>
<p>Examining the essence of the treaty: First, it removes the charge that Germany was the instigator of the Great War. Second, it reduces the huge sum of 35 billion marks that Germany was supposed to pay under the Young Plan to 3 billion marks.</p>
<p>Moreover, it will not be paid until three years later, when Germany's financial credit is restored, as a European recovery fund.</p>
<p>This can certainly be said to be a bargain for Germany. At the same time, the reparations issue can also be said to have found a possible solution.</p>
<p>However, after this "affirmation" came a "negation." This "negation" is the so-called</p>
<p>"Gentlemen's Agreement" of the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium. The main content of the Gentlemen's Agreement is that the four countries will not ratify the Lausanne Treaty until they have resolved their respective war debts. This is tantamount to saying that the Lausanne Treaty cannot be implemented unless the United States cancels all war debts. There is also a deeper effect here. If the United States refuses to cancel war debts, the responsibility for the non-implementation of the Lausanne Treaty should be borne by the United States. Therefore, the Four-Power Gentlemen's Agreement not only negates the Lausanne Treaty, but also forms a united Europe and openly challenges the United States.</p>
<p>Originally, since the end of the European War in 1918 and the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles, the United States, with its huge war debts to Europe of 15.6 billion gold dollars, had actually conquered the entire Europe through the Treaty of Versailles. After the Great War, the European countries were no different from the foreign treasury of American imperialists represented by fourteen New York Wall Street bankers. The Dawes Plan and the Young Plan were produced, further ensuring this foreign treasury. Germany's resources, tariffs, and even the economic life of all 60 million Germans were all controlled and dominated by the United States. Other countries, such as Britain, France, and Italy, also had to submit to the United States and accept its control because they relied on American gold dollars for loans after the war. If we say that in the European War, the United States gained a solid position in Europe based on military power under the command of Pershing, then we must admit that after the European War, the United States gained a second expansion of power over Europe based on gold dollar power under the control of the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan.</p>
<p>The gold dollar power of the United States, under such circumstances, through the Treaty of Versailles, through international banks...</p>
<p>has dominated the political situation in Europe for more than ten years.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Postal Workers from the Eastern Provinces Enter the Customs in Batches <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Pingjin Post Office Sets Up Reception Centers at the Train Station</p>
<p>Postal Workers Entering the Customs are Assigned to Various Postal Districts for Employment</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than 3,000 postal workers from the three northeastern provinces, including 250 from other provinces, have entered the customs in three batches. The Japanese are trying to prevent them. Those who have disguised themselves and arrived in Ping include Liu Yaoting, Deputy Director of Postal Affairs of the Three Eastern Provinces, An Baixiang, postal worker, Wu Shuqi, Director of the Jinzhou Bureau, and Wu Tiesen, Director of the Qianwei Bureau. More than 1,000 postal workers are on their way to enter the customs. The postal authorities have received an order from the Ministry of Communications that after this large number of postal workers arrive in Ping, they will be assigned to various postal districts in North China for employment, maintaining their original positions and receiving their original salaries. It is estimated that more than 300 of the first batch of more than 1,000 employees entering the customs will be assigned to the Ping postal district, more than 400 to the Jin postal district, more than 300 to the Jinan postal district, and other employees entering the customs will be assigned to various districts in South China. The Ping Postal Workers' Union sent a telegram to the postal bureaus along the Beining Railway to properly receive the postal workers entering the customs and provide all food and accommodation. A reception center has been set up at the Pingdong Railway Station. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Yaoting, Deputy Director of Postal Affairs of Liaoning Province, and Wu Shuqi, Director of the Jinzhou Post Office, entered the customs to discuss with Pingjin the arrangements for the entry of more than 3,000 postal workers from the Northeast. It has been decided that 300 people will be arranged in each of the Beiping and Jinan postal districts, 400 people will be arranged in the Tianjin postal district, and the rest will be sent to other postal districts for employment.

<p>No Mail from the Northeast Entered the Customs Yesterday</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) After all the post offices in the Northeast were sealed off on the 25th, no mail entered the customs on the 26th. At noon, there were staff from the Jinzhou, Xingcheng, and Suizhong bureaus, and in the evening, there were employees from the Shenyang and Xinmin bureaus who disguised themselves and arrived in Yu in small numbers. More are coming. Japanese military police along the way have been ordered to inspect and appear to want to detain postal workers. The Ping Postal Administration Bureau sent two staff members to Yu to receive them. The employees entering the customs took the night train to Ping. According to a staff member from the Jinzhou Bureau, at noon on the 25th, a Japanese man named Nagaoka went to the Jinzhou Bureau to search and posted a notice in front of the door, saying that the post office would be taken over and operated by the State of Manzhou from now on, selling State of Manzhou stamps, money orders, and postcards. All employees of the bureau must continue to serve as usual and not leave their posts without permission. According to a postal worker from the Shenyang Bureau, the Northeast Post Office was originally scheduled to be sealed off at the end of the month, but the head office, in view of the urgent situation, ordered it to be implemented in advance. All documents and light miscellaneous items from the bureaus have been transported to Pingjin for temporary storage, even the date stamps have not been left behind. On the night of the 24th, Balidi posted a notice in front of the Liaoning Postal Administration Bureau, saying that because the postal affairs in this jurisdiction have been forced to be unsustainable, it is hereby ordered to be sealed off from today onwards. The assets of this administration are estimated at 2 million, of which liabilities include more than 800,000 in unpaid savings and more than 200,000 in unpaid remittances. On the night of the 25th, Balidi summoned the employees of the administration to his residence for a speech and issued salaries for July and travel expenses to enter the customs, ordering all employees to gather in Ping. The Shanghai Head Office has designated the employees entering the customs to serve in the Pingjin Shanghai Qingdao bureaus. (26th Special Telegram)</p>

If China objects, Japan will set up an international post office in Dalian. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Japanese Force Postal Workers to Resume Work</p>
<p>(Beiping) Postal workers returning from the Northeast said that because we sealed off postal services in the Northeast, all post offices were closed and all mail communication was cut off.

<p>Japanese Government's Attitude After the Blockade</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government does not seem to want to act rashly regarding the Nanjing government's blockade of postal services in the Northeast, but intends to watch the development. It is expected that Japan may come forward to mediate as in the previous customs case. However, if China's actions cause losses to Japan, it is said that the Japanese government will lodge a protest.

<p>Miao Peinan's Division Returns to Shaoguan</p>
<p>Political Council Sends Zou Lu to Hong Kong</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Southwest Executive Department issued a circular telegram on the 26th, saying that the Communist bandits attacked Nanxiong on the 12th, hoping to seize our Guangzhou as a base to harm the whole country. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of one group were loyal and courageous, and fought bravely with two divisions for three days and nights, finally killing more than 6,000 enemies, capturing more than 1,000, and seizing more than 1,000 rifles. The remaining bandits were scattered. The Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian armies are now pursuing on different routes, determined to achieve a fundamental clearing. At this critical moment of national crisis, we deeply believe that only by destroying the Communist bandits can we consolidate the national foundation, and only by punishing the rebels can we resist the neighboring enemies. The Guangdong and Guangxi armies have already shouldered the responsibility of suppressing bandits, and the central government can relieve the worries of the south. We only hope to practice the words of long-term resistance, mobilize a large army, leave the customs to crusade, and recover lost land. We especially hope that our compatriots will confirm that today's suppression of Communists and punishment of rebels is the only way for national survival.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Impact of Seizure of Northeast Customs on Loan Guarantees <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A key official of the Ministry of Finance stated that the entire tax revenue from the Northeast customs for this month has been seized by the Northeast puppet regime. This not only deals a sudden blow to China's finances but also has a serious impact on all reparations to various countries and loan guarantees. Recently, the Japanese side is still conducting so-called mediation activities on this issue, demanding that the Chinese government recognize the Northeast customs revenue as being received by the puppet regime. They demand that all foreign debts guaranteed by the Northeast and Dalian customs be fully allocated from the Dalian customs revenue. If this is insufficient, it should be supplemented from the Northeast customs revenue. Our government still maintains its original position and will never compromise. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Song Ziwen stated today that the customs revenue for July, due to the seizure of all customs in the Northeast and the extraordinary deficit in customs revenue nationwide, it is estimated that the amount available to offset this month's loan repayments will fall short by Shanghai taels 3.7 million. It is estimated that the net customs revenue for July will only reach Shanghai taels 9.6 million, compared to the average monthly net revenue of Shanghai taels 19.331 million last year, a difference of more than almost one-fold. It is recalled that the tax revenue for June, according to the announcement by the Inspector General of Customs at the beginning of this month, totaled Shanghai taels 12.827 million. Offsetting the Shanghai taels 12.935 million due for loan repayments, not only was there no surplus, but there was also a deficit of Shanghai taels 100,800. The situation this month is even worse, with the estimated shortfall reaching as high as Shanghai taels 3.7 million. This dangerous situation is mostly due to the Japanese forcibly seizing the total revenue of all customs in the Northeast, including Dalian customs, resulting in a monthly reduction of about Shanghai taels 2 million in recent months. In addition, due to the decline in trade as a result of Japanese military actions in the Northeast and Shanghai, tax revenue has also decreased. The current tax situation shows that the statement by certain parties that there is no reason for international concerns that the customs revenue may be insufficient to cover loan repayments after the seizure of the Northeast customs is absurd. Minister Song also said that the Dalian branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank, under a bizarre pretext, claiming that the puppet authorities of Manchuria prohibited its remittance, strongly refused to remit the tax revenue accumulated before the seizure of the Northeast customs to the Shanghai office for loan guarantees. This accumulated tax revenue, along with the accumulated tax revenue of the Bank of China, which was also prohibited from remittance, amounted to a total of customs taels 2 million. The most basic principles of the international banking community have been undermined with such a flimsy excuse, which is truly unexpected. Minister Song also said that the urgent situation where tax revenue is insufficient to offset loan repayments requires the adoption of all feasible methods to remedy the situation. Now that China's finances are already being severely affected by the global economic recession, Japan's seizure of China's tax revenue, which guarantees international debts, makes the situation even more serious, which is truly unfortunate. Although the customs seized by the Japanese in recent months have not remitted a single penny, China has still been able to maintain its credit for debt repayment with difficulty. However, its ability to cope with this tense situation is clearly being affected by the monthly shortfall in tax revenue. (26th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The major difficulties in the transitional period of abolishing taels and adopting yuan, which are worthy of consideration, are that after the implementation of the abolition of taels, there will be a shortage of silver dollars because supply cannot meet demand. Although the mint is actively increasing minting, due to time constraints, the market will not have enough currency in circulation before a large quantity of silver dollars is minted. The government is discussing this issue in detail and will formulate a remedial measure under the principle of avoiding difficulties for the business community. As for international trade, a separate remedial plan will also be formulated to avoid obstruction. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Shi Qingyang stated that foreign reports have recently stated that the Tibetan side has concluded a secret treaty with Britain, and Russia is paying close attention to this matter, etc., which may not be true. Although the territories of Britain and Tibet are adjacent and Tibet is rich in resources, it may not be ignored by the British. However, the Dalai Lama has always been strongly anti-British, and even his close confidants are also anti-British, so it is unlikely that he would suddenly do this. Communication between China and Tibet is obstructed, information is blocked, and misunderstandings easily arise, giving outsiders an opportunity to take advantage of. The central government has always advocated a broad and peaceful approach to the Kang-Tibetan dispute, waiting for them to naturally come to their senses. It will not resort to force unless absolutely necessary. I am currently collecting various relevant documents and submitting them to the central government to formulate a comprehensive solution so that I can go there as soon as possible and handle the matter accordingly.

<p>Dr. Hayashi Appointed New President of South Manchuria Railway</p>
<p>Let's See the Future Steps of Aggression</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th – In order to unify the administration of Japanese in Manchuria, the Japanese Cabinet today decided to temporarily appoint the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in the Northeast as Plenipotentiary Envoy, concurrently serving as Governor-General of Kwantung and managing the South Manchuria Railway. The envoy will be under the direction of the Foreign Minister, managing diplomatic affairs and inspecting Japanese consulates stationed in Manchuria. It is predicted here that Army Training Inspector General Muto will be appointed to this important position. On the same day, the Cabinet meeting decided to appoint former Ambassador to Brazil, Arita Akira, as Minister to China, and Count Hayashi Hirotaro as President of the South Manchuria Railway. Due to this development, the government has telegraphed Kwantung Governor-General Yamaoka to return to Tokyo.</p>
<p>Outline of the Four-Headed Political Unification Plan</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 26th – The Japanese Cabinet today held a Cabinet meeting to decide on the Manchurian Four-Headed Political Unification Plan. The outline is as follows: (1) The Kwantung Army, Kwantung Government-General, South Manchuria Railway Company, and consular agencies will remain as before. (2) The Commander of the Kwantung Army will be appointed as the Governor-General of Kwantung. The Army Commander will govern the Kwantung Army, the Kwantung Government-General, and the South Manchuria Railway Company. To oversee the Consuls-General, the Commander of the Kwantung Army will be appointed as a temporary Plenipotentiary Ambassador. The positions of Kwantung Army Commander, Kwantung Government-General, and Plenipotentiary Ambassador will be combined into one. (3) To assist the Plenipotentiary Ambassador, additional personnel will be appointed, with the Chief Aide holding the qualification of Vice Foreign Minister. (4) The Kwantung Government-General and Consulates-General will remain in place, so there will be no Director-General of Administrative Affairs or Political Affairs Director-General, nor will there be a need to divide into Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, or Police Bureaus. (5) Consuls in Manchuria originally under the jurisdiction of the Embassy in China will now be transferred to the Plenipotentiary Ambassador. (6) The President of the South Manchuria Railway must be directed by the Plenipotentiary Ambassador, and the administrative power of the South Manchuria Railway's affiliated areas will be under the Kwantung Government-General. The purpose of this plan is to place all power in the three eastern provinces—political, diplomatic, industrial, administrative, and police—in the hands of the Japanese military. The Japanese military's desire to seize all political power in Japan has reached its first step. This plan is a proposal from the Kwantung Army Headquarters. The military's stance is very firm, and both the Colonial Affairs Ministry and the Foreign Affairs Ministry do not dare to oppose it. It is scheduled to be implemented on August 5th, and the first ambassador will be appointed, with former Chief of Staff Muto nominated for the position. Furthermore, the Japanese government will dispatch four powerful politicians to serve as councilors in the pseudo-state's pseudo-council. It is rumored that the Japanese government's candidates include Yamaoka, the current Governor-General of Kwantung; Nagata, the Mayor of Tokyo; Lt. Gen. Tsukushi; Tanaka, former Ambassador to Russia; Dr. of Law Matsumoto Joji; and former Tokyo Deputy Mayor Shirakami Yugen—selecting four from these six. The current councilors of the pseudo-council are Yuan Jinkai, Zhang Haipeng, Gui Fu, and Luo Zhenyu. If this is realized, the pseudo-state will be, in name and in reality, a branch store of Japan.</p>
<p>General Muto Is Well-Versed in Russian Affairs</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 26th – Today, the Cabinet meeting decided on the Four-Headed Political Unification Plan. Minister of the Army Araki recommended former Director-General of Education General Muto Nobuyoshi as the temporary Plenipotentiary Ambassador, which was unanimously approved by the cabinet ministers. The official appointment is scheduled for early August. The reason the Japanese Army Ministry recommended Muto as ambassador is because Muto is one of the few Russian experts within the Japanese Army, and they want to use Muto to deal with Russia.</p>
<p>Muto was born in Saga in 1868. He was appointed Second Lieutenant in the Army in 1893, Major General in 1916, Lieutenant General in 1919, and General in 1926.

After the May 15th Incident, he resigned as Director-General of Education and served exclusively as a Military Councilor. He is currently 65 years old.</p>

Finance Minister Takahashi was initially very optimistic, but after hearing the reports from local officials, he realized that without a major determination to deal with the situation, it would be impossible to escape this crisis. It is rumored that he has decided to distribute all the government-owned rice in storage to farmers before the Diet convenes, and at the same time, to start civil engineering projects early to provide farmers with a reasonable income. It can be seen that the difficulties of Japanese farmers have reached an extreme point.</p>

<p>Japanese Merchants Greatly Alarmed</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 25th – The Indian government today ordered the tax bureau to immediately investigate the issue of increasing taxes on cotton goods not manufactured in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the tax increase is to protect the Indian cotton textile industry. A large amount of Japanese cotton goods are imported into India. If the tax increase is implemented, Japanese goods will be most affected.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 26th – Representatives of Japanese importers and exporters in India today formed a delegation to meet with Sir [name], the Commerce Member of the Governor-General's Executive Council, to discuss the position of Japanese imported goods due to the possibility of India imposing new taxes on non-British-made cotton goods. They said that the Japanese only want to receive fair treatment in the Indian market. Although the tax rates have already increased, Japanese goods are still being imported in a steady stream, which proves that the production costs of Japanese goods have been reduced to an extremely low level. The representatives denied the claim of dumping and said that imports of British cloth into India have increased by 34 percent recently, while Japanese goods have only increased by 9 percent. Sir [name] told the representatives that the matter of the new tax has been handed over to the tax bureau for handling, and the bureau will listen to opinions from all sides.</p>

<p>Confession of the Assassin of President Doumer</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 25th – The trial of Goguloff, the assassin of President Doumer, opened today. After the public prosecution was read, the presiding judge described the defendant's past facts one by one. Goguloff only answered "Yes, yes." When asked about the defendant's</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>political activities, the defendant confessed that he had no relationship with the Bolsheviks, but he expressed great sympathy for Kerensky, the leader of the provisional government. The presiding judge then asked him whether he had been a member of the "Cheka" as the Caucasian Latsaroff had said. The defendant shouted loudly, "No, Latsaroff is a royalist. I am a social democrat. Latsaroff is actually a provocative witness. I oppose his words." Then he said, "I am a social democrat, not a royalist. I want to attack Bolshevism, but no one listens to me. If France cannot help me, then everything is over. 150 million people in Russia are punished with hard labor. My assassination is to express a protest on behalf of these 150 million people. Therefore, it is not an assassination, but a political tragedy." The judge asked about the defendant's abortion in the Czech Republic. Goguloff said that it was a slander by the royalists. When the judge mentioned the "Green Party" issue, Goguloff immediately held up a copy of the money in his hand and shouted loudly to the crowd, "France! France! Will it listen to me?" The whole hall burst into laughter. The presiding judge quickly stopped him. Goguloff also said, "I organized the Green Party to preach the truth. Unfortunately, I was deceived by my own party members." When the judge asked about his living situation, the defendant said that he had married for the fourth time and received 40,000 francs. Before that, it was very difficult. He lost 10,000 of this money at the Monaco casino. At this point, the court temporarily adjourned. The court reopened at 3:15 PM, and the interrogation of the assassination of the president began. The judge asked, "When you assassinated him, the muzzle of the gun was close to the president's body." Goguloff replied, "Perhaps so, but I don't remember very well. At that time, I only saw President Doumer's head. I only fired the gun once. But I also can't explain why I carried so many weapons and bullets." The judge asked, "Why did you only fire the gun once?" Goguloff replied again, "Fired the gun once." The judge asked in this way five or six times, and Goguloff's answers did not change five or six times. The last time, he said, "I shot once with an automatic pistol. The gun went off by itself." As soon as this was said, the crowd was shocked. The defendant also said that the gun had not been used for a long time since he lived in the Czech Republic. The only thing the defendant paid attention to was his Green Party plan. His feelings were obvious. Then he declared, "The reason I assassinated the president was because he cooperated with the Federation and approved the tyranny of communism to harm Russia. He had no grudge against Doumer. I am a good friend of France." The presiding judge announced the end of the interrogation and then called the witness. The first one on the stand was former Colonial Minister Paul Reynaud. He happened to be beside the president at the time of the assassination. Reynaud described the painful state of Doumer when he was dying, which was tragic and moving. Goguloff clenched his fist and shouted to Reynaud, "You can take my life, but my thoughts are for the happiness of the Russian people, so they should be saved." Association of Veterans Authors President [name] and Journalist [name] spoke last, both saying that there were fifteen seconds between the two shots.</p>
<h3 id="e59">U.S. Senator Borah Suggests <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Convening a World Economic Conference</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th – Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested several days ago that the League of Nations meeting be convened immediately to consider the correction or cancellation of war debts. Now he has put forward an important suggestion, saying that the United States should initiate the convening of an international economic conference. He believes that any international discussion aimed at permanently restoring trade should focus on war debts and reparations as important issues. This matter must be handled as soon as possible. He asserted that armaments must be greatly reduced. He will demand that the world reduce armaments by half. Borah's plan focuses on linking war debts with prosperous trade, advocating that U.S. negotiations should be based on the ability of debtor countries to absorb U.S. exports, rather than on their ability to repay, and advocating that a conference be convened by a country other than the United States, in order to avoid the League of Nations, because the League of Nations is now an insignificant organization. According to the New York Herald Tribune, Borah's remarks may not have been approved by the White House in advance. However, according to the New York Times, it was learned from a high-level source that Borah was just blowing his own horn, neither consulting the White House nor the State Department. Borah also wants Soviet Russia to participate in the conference and acknowledges that it is difficult to convene this conference before the autumn elections. Borah stressed that if countries do not unite quickly today, the economic decline will be endless. If there is no upward trend today, the situation will worsen and eventually become a disaster.</p>

<h3 id="e60">North China Generals Arrive in Beiping <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Han Fuju and Shang Zhen Arrive First</p>
<p>Xu Yongchang and Others Will Follow Soon</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Recently, due to the tense situation in North China, senior generals have arrived in Beiping to discuss major plans together. Those who have already arrived include Han Fuju and Shang Zhen. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Han Fuju: Shandong Chairman Han Fuju and former 13th Route Commander-in-Chief Shi Yousan arrived in Beiping at 3:00 AM on the 23rd. According to Han's statement, "I (Han referring to himself) am a soldier and come from the ranks. As for the country, I only know to do my best in my duties. Also serving as civil administrator, the responsibility is heavy. In Shandong, the goal is to eliminate bandits and pacify the people. Now that foreign aggression is becoming increasingly urgent, I believe that (1) internally, we should implement unity and combine the strength of the whole country to resist foreign aggression. Naturally, there are ways. With the loss of the Northeast, national defense has been lost. The impact has made Tianjin and Beiping precarious. With the issue of Rehe arising, the people of the country must recognize that it is not the issue of Rehe, but the entire issue of China. Everyone must use their strength to help this national crisis. In North China, in particular, everyone should think of a way to unite sincerely. The adage 'lips are gone, teeth are cold' is self-evident. If the Japanese occupy this place, they will want that place. If everyone has the mindset that China is vast and rich in resources, then it will not end. Regarding this point, before leaving Jinan, I telegraphed Sun Chu, Yang Aiyuan, and Xu Yongchang in Shanxi, asking them to meet in Beiping to discuss solutions. I have received a reply telegram, agreeing to depart immediately. If time permits, they can come together, otherwise one or two of them will come along. Today's affairs are extremely urgent. Everyone must seek solutions in the absence of solutions, and seek survival in the face of impossibility. (2) As a soldier, I only know to protect the country and its borders. If foreigners invade our land, even an inch or a foot, I will never ignore it. Today, not only must the current situation be maintained, but the lost territories of the Northeast must also be recovered. China's nation raises the most soldiers. This is the day to serve the country. Although the enemy's special qualities are strong, if we use a prolonged method to extend the situation, in the end, justice can still triumph over power. Soldiers only need to be able to sacrifice, and they must sacrifice themselves. There is no reason why we cannot win the final victory. Life is only a hundred years, and everyone will eventually die. As long as we see through the meaning of death, nothing is unsacrificable, nothing is impossible to do. Today, against foreign countries, is precisely a great path to do. In short, China today is at a time of reckless courage, not a time to be afraid in the face of adversity. The people of the country should immediately realize that after the country is destroyed, there is no such thing as rich or poor, noble or lowly, all will perish together. (3) Shi Hanzhang came with me this time to meet with Director Zhang (Xueliang). It is a manifestation of sincere unity. Shi often says that he is from the Northeast, and now he has personally experienced the plight of a destroyed country, which is extremely painful. The only way to save it in the future is for everyone to unite and defend the country. Director Zhang is said to have a minor illness. After the adjutant-general Tang (Guozhen) makes contact, he will accompany him to pay respects to Director Zhang. Mr. Feng (Yuxiang) is currently in Taian, reading, writing, painting bamboo, and traveling, with a very leisurely attitude, and has no other intentions for the time being. I came here at the invitation of Director Zhang to discuss military and political issues. I plan to stay in Beiping for a week and then return to Shandong."</p>
<p>Shang Zhen: The 32nd Army Commander Shang Zhen arrived in Beiping by the Pinghan express train at 7:40 AM on the 23rd. Han Fuju, Wan Fulin, and Li Peiji welcomed him at the station. After Shang got off the train, he thanked the welcomers one by one and asked when Han had arrived in Beiping. He then took a car to his private residence on Nanchang Street to rest. The reporter went to Shang's residence to send a card requesting an audience, and obtained the following remarks: "A part of my army has been ordered to move defenses to Henan Province, and they have now arrived at the new defenses. Gao Hongwen's brigade is in western Henan, with the brigade headquarters stationed in Luoyang. Huang Guanghua's brigade is in northern Henan, with the brigade headquarters stationed in Zhengzhou. The 32nd Army Headquarters is stationed in Xingcun. The 42nd Brigade and all directly subordinate units are still stationed at the original defense in Shunde. After the relocation of the Gao and Huang brigades was completed, I went to Hankou on the 11th to pay respects to Chairman Chiang to report on the progress of the relocation. I stayed in Hankou for four days and five nights, and returned north to Shunde on the 16th. The communist bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui are scheduled to be eliminated within three months. Even if it is difficult to complete on schedule at that time, they should be wiped out within six months. Since Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou, the morale of the army has been greatly boosted, and discipline has been greatly improved. I came here to pay respects to Director Zhang and report on the defense. I will stay in Beiping for three to five days and then return to the defense area."</p>
<p>Xu Yongchang: Shanxi Provincial Government Chairman Xu Yongchang sent a telegram to Han Fuju on the 23rd, saying that he would definitely come to Beiping from Taiyuan on the 25th or 26th, with one of Yang Aiyuan and Sun Chu accompanying him. In addition, Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi will also come to Beiping in the next few days to pay respects to Director Zhang and discuss military and political issues in North China. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">He Yingqin Reports on Resisting Aggression and Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>He Yingqin reported on resisting aggression and suppressing bandits at the Central Memorial Week on the 25th morning, stating roughly that the important issues facing China currently are resisting aggression and suppressing bandits. Failure to resist foreign aggression will lead to national subjugation, and failure to suppress the Red bandits will lead to racial extinction. I am responsible for suppressing bandits in Jiangxi Province, and I will now report on the recent bandit situation in various provinces in general terms: (1) Jiangxi Province: Jiangxi is the base of the Red bandits, and the extent of the bandit disaster and the difficulty of suppression are the greatest among all provinces. It is estimated that the bandits have an organized military force of over ten armies, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 men, with approximately 30,000 to 40,000 rifles. They are scattered in southern Jiangxi, including Xingguo, Yudu, Ruijin, Shicheng, Ningdu; western Jiangxi, including Lianhua, Yongxin, Xiushui, Tonggu; eastern Jiangxi, including Geyang, Dexing; western Fujian, including Changting, Jianning; the border between Guangdong and Jiangxi, including Dayu, Nanxiong; and the border between Hunan and Jiangxi, including Guidong, Rucheng. In the past, methods of suppressing bandits that sought quick results consumed much effort but achieved little success. This time, the method of suppressing bandits is to take a steady and solid approach. After recovering a place, the area is thoroughly cleared. Since implementing this approach, the bandit units in eastern Jiangxi, such as Fang Shao, and western Jiangxi, such as Kong Duan, have been dealt severe blows repeatedly. The Peng Dehuai bandit unit, which has been causing trouble on the border between Jiangxi and Hunan, has also been encircled and attacked by the combined forces of the National Army from Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan in the area around Guidong, Rucheng, Jilongyingqian, and Shangbao. The Peng bandits, failing to invade Hunan, and the Zhu bandits also fled back to Jiangxi from Fujian, attempting to reoccupy their old nest in southern Jiangxi and plotting to disturb the border of Guangdong. However, the Guangdong army under Yu Hanmou was prepared, and the troops from Hunan and Jiangxi continued to pursue them relentlessly. Recently, Zhang Meixin's division of my unit defeated the bandits near Nanxiong. The 19th Route Army has now fully arrived in Fujian, and Chen Bonan has increased the number of troops and the Gui army under Wang Zanbin are successively concentrating on the border of Jiangxi. A major blow to the Red bandits and the annihilation of all or most of them is inevitable soon. The reports from Hong Kong that Dayu, Nanxiong, and Nankang have been captured by the bandits are completely untrue. (2) The border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui: The border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, including Huang'an, Luotian, Yingshan, Shangcheng, northern Huang'an and Macheng, western Liu'an and Huoshan, southern Guangshan, Luoshan, Huangchuan, Gushi, and southeastern Xinyang, spans hundreds of miles, with a bandit gathering of 30,000 men and approximately 20,000 rifles. The bandit leaders are Ji Xun, Duan Dechang, Xu Xiangqian, and others. Although various armies have been suppressing them for years, the bandits are constantly on the move, making it difficult to eliminate them. Last month, taking advantage of our engagement with foreign affairs, the bandits advanced to Gushi with a portion of their forces and fled to the area of Sanhejian, Liu'an, and Huoqiu with the majority of their forces. They even occupied Zhengyangguan for a time, and the Jinpu Railway line became strained. Subsequently, Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to Wuhan to supervise the suppression, and the Central reinforcements arrived. Huoqiu has been recovered by Xu's division, and the Red bandits have suffered over 7,000 casualties and prisoners. The future of suppressing bandits in the border area of the three provinces should improve day by day. (3) Hubei Province: In Hubei Province, apart from the three towns of Wuhan and their surrounding areas, famine victims and bandits are mixed everywhere. In addition to eastern Hubei, central Hubei has He Duan with approximately 30,000 men and 20,000 rifles. Southern and western Hubei have Kong Hechong, Wang Bingnan, and a portion of He Duan's forces, with approximately 10,000 men and approximately 5,000 rifles. To the north, there are Chen Kechun, Wei Guozhu, and other bandit groups with 20,000 men and approximately 10,000 rifles, relying on the mountains and lakes, and constantly on the move. In the spring of this year, He Chengjun divided the entire province into three pacification zones and made efforts to clear out the bandits. Xu Yuanquan's troops in central Hubei and Wang Lingji's Sichuan army in western Hubei have achieved results, inflicting significant blows on the bandits. Now Chiang is in Wuhan, planning a comprehensive clearing. Although the bandit problem in Hubei is deep-rooted, it should not be difficult to eliminate them together with the bandits in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui at an early date. The Red bandits in various provinces are holding up more than 600,000 National Army troops. While major Red bandit forces must be destroyed and cleared by military force, the root of the problem still lies in political improvement and transportation construction. In early May, the Jiangxi Provincial Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Meeting was held, and I proposed ten motions: (1) Strictly implement the Baojia system (household registration); (2) Organize the masses; (3) Build fortresses extensively; (4) Promote highways; (5) Clean up land; (6) Recruit refugees; (7) Comfort and appease those who were coerced into joining; (8) Assist in the clearing of bandits; (9) Promote cooperation; (10) Clarify official corruption. All were passed. Chiang also convened a bandit suppression meeting in Lushan, and after extensive consultation and inquiry on administrative construction issues related to bandit suppression, a perfect decision was made, strictly ordering the provinces in the bandit areas to follow and implement it. The Lushan meeting also decided on the principles for dealing with those who have reformed and those who were coerced into becoming bandits: (1) If the masses were indeed coerced, they should first submit a pledge that they were indeed coerced in the past and that they will sincerely reform in the future, and the pledge should be guaranteed by their father, brother, clan head, or a fair-minded local gentry, and the pledge should be submitted to the county magistrate for approval. (2) Those who were coerced into joining the bandits and have reformed after being approved by the county should be ordered to have guarantors to monitor and correct their behavior at any time. (3) If the reformed elements voluntarily return to their hometowns and have not held important false positions or committed major crimes, they should voluntarily issue a sincere pledge of repentance and attach a guarantee from their father, brother, and five neighbors, and submit it to the county magistrate for approval. (4) After the reformed elements are approved by the county magistrate, the county magistrate will issue a certificate of reformation, and they should be supervised by the guarantor at any time. (5) Reformed elements who can demonstrate one of the following achievements in bandit suppression work may be exempted from the restrictions of the preceding article and may be separately submitted to the county magistrate for review and award according to their circumstances: (A) Capturing and delivering bandit leaders; (B) Reporting the hidden area of bandit leaders or a huge bandit den and leading the way to its destruction; (C) Surrendering a number of guns or a large amount of grain;</p>
<p>(D) Being able to publicly expose all the inhuman crimes and rebellious acts of the Red bandits in the place of residence, with notable achievements. (6) The lives and property of the coerced masses and reformed elements should be fully protected after being approved by the competent government agency to return to their place of residence. (7) Local people should not satirize or insult the coerced masses and reformed elements who have been approved by the government to return to their place of residence. (8) Any public officials who handle the reformation and cause extortion or obstruct the reformation of the people by force will be penalized, and the reformed elements and their relatives may report the facts to the county magistrate, but those who make false accusations out of malice will be punished in reverse. (9) The county magistrate of each county should announce the above-mentioned measures to the public to ensure that everyone knows them. (10) The county magistrate of each county should report the cases of resettling the coerced masses and reformed elements to the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs for record. Our party is very lenient to the Red bandits who repent and reform. Xu Tingyao captured thousands of bandit officials and soldiers in Huoqiu this time. Except for a few dozen important bandits who are responsible for political guidance who are temporarily detained, the rest are given funds to return to their hometowns. Seventy to eighty percent of the Red bandits are coerced or enticed, hoping that they can abandon evil and return to righteousness. Forgetfulness is indeed an inferiority of the Chinese nation. After the September 18th Incident, the people of the country only knew the danger of the Northeast and forgot the hidden danger of the Red bandits. After the January 28th Incident, the people of the country only knew the danger of Shanghai and ignored the problems of the Northeast and the Red bandits. When the Shanghai war stopped and the Japanese soldiers withdrew, the people of the country regarded resisting aggression and suppressing bandits as if they were irrelevant, living in a drunken dream, singing and dancing, and indulging in the sweet dream of the old nation for thousands of years. If this continues, even without the invasion of foreign enemies and bandits, it will be difficult for the Chinese nation to reach the path of independence, equality, and freedom. This is what I personally feel most painful about, and I hope that the people of the country will make serious corrections.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Rampant Banditry in Wuyuan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence: Wuyuan is located on the border of Anhui, adjacent to Jiangxi and Zhejiang. In recent years, the Red bandits have caused disaster in Jiangxi, and the situation in Wuyuan has been tense from time to time. Since last winter, when Zhou Jianping and Tang Zai just two bandit groups took advantage of the withdrawal of the garrison troops in Wuyuan, they looted and burned extensively and left. Last month, Shao and Zhou two bandit groups with more than 4,000 people, besieged Xinheng in Dexing County, and at that time, they planned to attack Wuyuan City again. Fortunately, the bandit suppression army stationed in Jiangxi joined forces with the air force to launch a combined attack, killing more than 2,000 bandits. The remnants fled in all directions. It is heard that recently, hundreds of bandits from the group have fled to the area of Tian Zhanfang, 30 miles away in Dongxiang, 40 miles away from Wuyuan City, looting extensively. Many of the nearby villages that did not have time to escape were captured, and their lives and property suffered heavy losses. There is now a trend of spreading throughout the county. It is heard that the central government has dispatched the 57th Division, Tan Brigade, from Wuhu to garrison the county seat. Huabu and Kaihua on the border of Zhejiang also have troops from the 6th Division, Zhao Guantao's unit, stationed there. It is found that the two places are close to the bandit area, so the people of the county are very anxious.</p>

<p>Gunpoint Robbery in Niujiaobang During the Day: A gunpoint robbery occurred in Niujiaobang, Yuanmiao Temple, Suzhou City, at around 5:00 PM on the 25th. The victim was Zhou Wenbao, a clerk from the Qimen Yiyuan Wheat Shop, who was escorting 4,000 yuan in silver to the Qingtai Zhuang in front of the temple. On the way back, because he still had a balance of 50 yuan in hand, he was intimidated by a teenager holding a handgun, who robbed him of the 50 yuan in silver. The police quickly captured the teenager and found the stolen silver and a handgun. According to his confession, his name is Xia Wenhua, an employee of the Hongsheng Match Company, 20 years old, from Ningbo (external rumors that he is the nephew of Gui Minbo, the manager of the Greater China Match Company, are inaccurate). His monthly salary at the factory is 14 yuan, and the factory provides food and lodging. This theft was actually due to a marriage arranged in his hometown for next month (August), which must be completed on schedule. All of his monthly salary has been spent, and in Ningbo customs, failing to marry on schedule is considered a great shame, so he resorted to this measure. As for the source of his handgun, according to his confession, he borrowed it from the Fifth Division of the Merchant Corps because he usually had contact with people in the Fifth Division of the Merchant Corps. The police from the Second and Third Precincts immediately transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Record of Prison Warden Transfers: On the 26th, the High Court announced that the resignation of Cheng Zhenlin, prison warden of Taixing, was approved. The vacancy was filled by transferring Jiang Zhenyuan from Nanhui. The vacancy of the prison warden of Nanhui was filled by appointing Li Yingchang. In addition, Tao Shouhe, prison warden of Liyang, was accused of being transferred to the province. The vacancy was filled by appointing Xin Jijin, and Ye Chengshu was appointed as the acting director of the detention center of this court.</p>

<p>Petition to Revise New Regulations on Cotton Yarn Transportation Permits: Lixin Company of this county believes that the new Cotton Yarn and Woven Product Origin/Destination Change Transportation Permit issued by the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance is divided into two types: Pure Weaving Factory Special Cotton Yarn Direct Woven Product Transportation Permit. There are many obstacles, and it should state the reasons to seek improvement. It roughly stated that pure weaving factories have a wide variety of product colors, which are more unsalable than plain coarse cloth, and the situation is very different. Winter goods are stored in summer, and spring goods are sold in autumn. Often, they are stored for a year and a half and cannot be sold out. Moreover, some cotton cloths woven in spring must be sold in August or September and have been stacked for half a year without any movement. If the new regulations stipulate that the period of three months expires, it will actually be too late. Moreover, the new regulations stipulate that the permit holder may report the unsold goods to the local tax authorities, who will verify that the goods match the permit and grant an extension. This is too cumbersome. Moreover, the goods that each factory transports to wholesale outlets for distribution every day must be sold at the right time and cannot be sold out at that time. In the future, when the three-month period expires, the wholesale outlets in various places will inevitably have to apply to the local tax authorities for an extension every day. Not only will merchants suffer greatly, but the government will also feel cumbersome and overwhelmed. Although pure woven products are not goods that are directly subject to tax, they are indirectly goods that bear the unified tax. They should be treated the same as cotton yarn. Once the old regulations are changed, merchants may occasionally make omissions, and penalties will follow, which will lose the government's purpose of maintaining domestic goods. Yesterday, it specially sent a public letter to the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association, requesting it to forward it to the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance to strive for the revision of the two types of transportation permits stipulated in the new regulations, with a validity period of one year. If the reasons for not being able to sell out after the expiration date are still reported to the local tax authorities, who will verify that the goods match the permit, an extension will be granted.</p>

<p>Ministry Appoints Commissioner to Shazhou to Secretly Investigate Important Cases: Yang Shinan, a commissioner sent by the Capital Garrison Command, arrived at Chunyangtang in the Fourth District of Shazhou a few days ago to secretly investigate the district headquarters of the Fourth District Security Regiment. According to reports, Xu Jinxiu, a member of Chunyangtang, served as the pseudo-vice commander of the Red bandits on the Jinghu Line and planned a major riot in August this year. To prevent problems before they occur, an early investigation was conducted. After local people stated that Xu was fair and just and had graduated from the Party Affairs Training Institute, it was feared that it was a malicious accusation and not a fact. After the commissioner Yang investigated, he left Shazhou and returned to Nanjing to report.</p>

<p>Summoning of Wuchang Ship Smuggling Offenders: Zhang Guangyou, the main character in the Wuchang ship smuggling case, was prosecuted by the Zhenjiang Court after the case was discovered and sentenced to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 800 yuan. Lu Jinyu, who was related to the case, was sentenced to two years and one month of imprisonment. Xu Ruirui was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and a fine of 500 yuan. All refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court. Because the general amnesty was imminent, the defendants in the case had not been interrogated. Now that the general amnesty order has been issued, the criminals are appropriately sentenced to reduced sentences.

Yesterday, summons were issued and the trial was scheduled to be held at 8:00 AM on August 6.</p>

<p>Terrible Epidemic Spreading: The weather has been extremely hot in recent days, with the Fahrenheit reading reaching 103 degrees. Cholera or various types of similar epidemic diseases have been found in the city and suburbs, and at least a dozen people die every day. It is even worse in Shaobo. The fastest cases are beyond treatment, and death occurs within an hour. For example, the daughter-in-law who sells clothes in Guanfeng Lane and the Qiao woman from Xiaqiao Township who came to Yang to offer incense to Guanyin. One went to see a Western doctor and returned to get a salt water injection, but was already dead when she returned. The other went from the city to the mountain, but died before reaching the mountain, and was carried back in a rattan chair. Today (24th), Chen Qixiaohe from Beixiaojie had an attack of a rash at his father-in-law's house, and died halfway while being carried, and has been taken to the Western Temple for burial.</p>
<p>Two Jin of Noodles Leads to Two Tragic Deaths: Mei Da and his wife, disaster victims from Yangjiazhuang, Shaobo, have two young children and have no means of support and are constantly hungry. Yesterday, Mei helped work in a neighboring village, and his wife pledged two jin of noodles from a neighboring cake shop with old clothes and returned home. After leaving through the back door to find amaranth, in the blink of an eye, only a little noodles were left. Detecting that the two children had eaten it raw because they were extremely hungry, she could not help but feel sad, and secretly entered the room and hanged herself. When Mei returned and saw the situation, knowing that he could not live, he also hanged himself. The next morning, the neighbors learned about it and helped with the funeral, which was also tragic.</p>

<p>Epidemic Spreads and Deaths Follow: Since the epidemic spread from Shanghai to this county, an average of six or seven people die every day inside and outside the city. Recently, the Yang family in Yinyang Lane, a storyteller from Kuailewei, a certain A from Fengjing, and a Fang from Guanghua Sock Factory all died of the epidemic within two or three hours. Coffin shops have started working at night. Most of the customers in pharmacies are those who buy ten drops of water and cologne. For a time, the medicines to treat the epidemic were sold out. Pu Yangyong, a doctor at the Central Pharmacy, specially prepared 100 yuan of medicinal seedlings and offered them as preventive injections. More than 600 people have applied for injections. There are also others who are doing the same good deeds as Pu, and the number of people seeking treatment is unknown. The towns of Xindai, Xincang, and Xinmiao are more superstitious and do not seek radical treatment, and the number of deaths is even greater.</p>

<p>Eastern Township Silkworm Farmers Change to Raising Autumn Silkworms: The silkworm farmers in the eastern township failed to produce silkworm cocoons this year, and the losses are not light. Recently, the provincial government issued autumn silkworm seeds and instructed them to change to raising autumn silkworms again to make up for the shortage. County Magistrate Zhang went to the township a few days ago to make a propaganda campaign. Now the farmers are busy with field work due to the drought, and they are not fully confident in planting rice, so most of them buy autumn silkworm seeds in order to make up for the losses.</p>
<p>Farmland in Four Townships Suffers from Drought: There has been no rain in Xiaoshan for the past two weeks of hot weather. Most of the mountain township farmland has withered. The early rice in the southern township is lacking rain, resulting in failure to form ears and a significant reduction in harvest. The late rice in the eastern and western townships is currently being cultivated, and the water is also very busy. However, under the hot sun every day, the river water dries up more quickly. If the drought continues for another ten days, the farmland in the four townships may be difficult to bear fruit, resulting in a drought.</p>

<p>How Students Should Use Their Summer Vacation</p>
<p>(I) Wang Xiaoying</p>
<p>(I) The Meaning of Summer Vacation</p>
<p>In the very hot summer, no matter how well-equipped the classroom is, there is no way to avoid the might of the scorching heat. Especially during the noon hours every day, the high-temperature air is suffocating and makes people drowsy, unable to muster any energy. The lamplight at night is no longer friendly, and it is even more difficult to study on your own. Therefore, there is indeed a need for a short period of vacation here—summer vacation. However, the meaning of summer vacation is not to say that students' studies can be completely abandoned during the summer vacation, but only to say that in this sweltering summer, students return home from school, and the adjustment of their lives can be decided more freely.</p>
<p>(II) This Year's Summer Vacation</p>
<p>This year's summer vacation is even more worthy of our attention. The Japanese troops in Shanghai have not completely withdrawn, the volunteer army in the three northeastern provinces is also fighting the Japanese imperialism desperately under the scorching sun, and Rehe is currently alarming again. Moreover, last year's flood has not yet been recovered, and what is in front of us is a tragic and miserable "Picture of Refugees." The national crisis is like this, the people's suffering is like this, how can we be content to enjoy ourselves alone and leisurely spend our days in this summer vacation?</p>
<p>Moreover, more than 80% of the people in the country currently do not have the opportunity to study. There are unemployed youths everywhere. We can say that we are very lucky to be able to fight for a chance to study among tens of thousands of people. Therefore, we must not fail this opportunity, nor can we easily spend the good time of the current summer vacation.</p>
<p>(III) Plans for Utilizing Summer Vacation</p>
<p>What should we do during the summer vacation? Below I will outline a summary, and each individual can estimate the possible extent and set their own plans.</p>
<p>A. In terms of academic research, the first thing to mention is academic research. Of course, we must never allow our existing knowledge to disappear from our memory, and new research should also strengthen the depth of memory and transform rigid memory into an active system. In terms of research methods, two opposite paths should be taken, which are actually half of the entire research process, that is, 1. Use existing knowledge to interpret reality, and 2. Seek new theories from the investigation of reality. As for the scope of research, it can also be roughly divided into two:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding natural sciences, such as the study of grains and poultry, the study of storms, seasons, rain, mountain floods, ice, hail, and meteorites, the study of improved seeds and fertilizers, the study of soil, the study of pest and disease control, the study of epidemic prevention, the study of the causes of natural disasters, the study of special products and local products, etc. Everything around us can be used as materials for the study of natural sciences.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding social scientists, the study of the world economic panic and the Lausanne and disarmament conferences, the study of the Soviet Union's five-year plan and cultural policy, the study of Japan, the study of the Northeast problem, the study of rural economy, the study of water conservancy and water disasters, the study of customs and cultures in various places, the study of the situation in disaster areas, the study of inland transportation, and the study of student movements, etc. It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that all social phenomena have mutually influencing and mutually exciting relationships. Read newspapers and magazines daily, and investigate special accidents that occur nearby, such as suicides and robberies, to explore various causes and results, so as to understand the essence of the existing society and prepare to decide how to take the direction of promoting social welfare when we enter society in the future.</p>
<p>B. In terms of cultivating body and mind, young students, with the normal climate of high spirits, should also pay special attention to cultivating body and mind. Bad habits and infectious viruses are equally great enemies of society. We must strictly prevent them from combining with our body and mind.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline of Measures for Public Schools in January of the 18th year of the Republic of China and has repeatedly urged its implementation. Public schools in various places have sprung up and made great progress. However, when can we expect them to be popularized, how much will the number of illiterate people be reduced, and what is the situation regarding funding, teachers, and teaching? There is no practical survey. Therefore, the Ministry prepared a questionnaire in February and March of this year and instructed the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to fill it out item by item. Currently, 25 provinces and cities have reported to the Ministry. In order to understand the implementation of public education in the country, the Ministry has compiled a comparison of the general situation of public schools in various provinces and cities as a basis for future improvement. The following is a summary of the main points explained in the statistics: (1) The estimated number of out-of-school people in various provinces and cities is approximately 224,473,253 (referring to older out-of-school people). (2) The number of illiterate people reduced in various provinces and cities is more than 1.45 million (approximately 1.5% of the total number of illiterate people). (3) The province with the largest reduction in illiterate people is Shanxi, and the provinces with the smallest reduction are Henan, Hubei, and Xinjiang. (4) The annual funding for public schools in various provinces and cities is approximately 497,000 yuan. (5) The lowest monthly salary for teachers in public schools is 2 yuan, the highest is 50 yuan, and the average is 14.3 yuan. (6) In the total of 25 districts, 23 districts have coeducational schools, 1 district has separate schools, and 1 district only accepts male students. (7) The city with the most female students is Shanghai, and the provinces with the fewest are Shandong, Rehe, and Xinjiang. (8) The lowest age of students is 7 years old, and the highest age is 61 years old. (9) The shortest study period is three months, and the longest is one year. (10) The difficulties are generally the lack of funding and talent, uneven student levels, and difficulty in enrollment.</p>

<p>Jinan University Nursing School Movement</p>
<p>｜Professor Sun Hanbing and Others Go to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>｜Student School Protection Movement Association Established Yesterday</p>
<p>Firm Opposition to the Government's Abolition and Merger of the Law and Education Schools</p>
<p>Representatives such as He Defu Elected to Go to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan formally passed the Ministry of Education's proposal on July 22 to abolish and merge the Law and Education Schools of National Jinan University, in addition to the Professors' Association dispatching representatives such as Sun Hanbing and Guo Yicen to Beijing to petition, the students have been particularly enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Students from various departments of the school mutually elected representatives and held a temporary representative assembly in the first school building on the 24th. It was immediately resolved that all students of the school would organize a Student School Protection Movement Association to carry out and realize the task of protecting the school. A date was set for yesterday (the 25th) to convene a general assembly of all students, which was also the inaugural meeting of the Student School Protection Movement Association. Yesterday (the 25th) at 8:00 AM, all students of the school gathered in the playground of the first school building. Representatives from the Suzhou Middle School Department also attended the meeting, which was officially opened under the scorching sun. The resolutions discussed and passed on that day were: (1) The association was named the National Jinan University All-Student School Protection Movement Association; (2) The organization of the association would have the general assembly as the highest authority. After the adjournment of the general assembly, the executive committee would be the highest authority. The executive committee would be divided into five departments: general affairs, organization, publicity, social interaction, and investigation. The number of executive committee members would be twenty-one, with seven alternates, jointly elected from students of the university and middle school departments. The executive committee would be responsible to the executive committee, and there would be a separate secretariat responsible to the general assembly; (3) Issue a founding declaration; (4) Dispatch representatives He Defu, Xie Shaobai, Liu Jingyin, Feng Yuzhang, and Lin Zhuguang to Beijing by express train last night (the 25th) with a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education; (5) Send telegrams to national cultural institutions and major middle schools requesting assistance, and send telegrams to overseas Chinese in Nanyang and other regions for unified support.</p>
<p>In addition, the association has scheduled a press conference at 2:00 PM on the 27th at the China News Agency on Weihai Road in this city to announce the establishment process and recent work of the association.</p>
<p>Opinions of Professor Sun Hanbing and Others</p>
<p>Detailed Answers to Zhu's Remarks</p>
<p>Concrete Plans Needed for Educational Reform</p>
<p>A reporter from the Nanjing Dadao News Agency yesterday interviewed Sun Hanbing, Dean of the Law School of Jinan University, Guo Yicen, Dean of the Education School, and Professors Zhang Haishu and Hu Qiuyuan at the Central Hotel, asking for their opinions on the Executive Yuan's decision to abolish and merge Jinan University. The following is a record of their conversation: The government's resolution to abolish and merge Jinan University was proposed by the Minister of Education and passed by the Executive Yuan meeting. We very much agree in principle with the Executive Yuan's general order to reform education and the remarks made by Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua on reorganizing universities across the country. In particular, we fully understand the government's painstaking efforts to reform education. However, since the reform is of universities across the country, there should be a concrete plan to give the people of the country a common vision in order to achieve the effect of comprehensive planning and overall consideration, and there should be a certain standard in implementation. This is in general terms of the reform. As for Jinan University, based on the remarks made by Minister Zhu in the "Xin Jing Daily" on the 24th, we also have a few opinions: (1)</p>
<p>Regarding the significance and purpose of overseas Chinese education, we believe that it is not only to cultivate overseas Chinese children who return to their homeland so that they can understand the culture and customs of the motherland, but also to cultivate talents in the country to develop overseas. We believe that the latter is more important than the former. Based on this point, we believe that Minister Zhu's so-called "someone" saying "overseas Chinese universities are unnecessary" is not necessarily reasonable, and it is not wrong for Jinan University to accept students who are not overseas Chinese children. As for saying that the purpose of establishing Jinan University is to reward overseas Chinese who have served the motherland, the original reason for its establishment may have been this, but now its purpose and significance should conform to the needs of the times and be more progressive. (2) Regarding the abolition and merger of the Law and Education Schools, in Minister Zhu's view, Jinan University should tighten its belt due to the losses suffered in the Shanghai war. As for the austerity measures, the Law School will be merged into Zhongda, and the Education School will be reduced to a department (originally three departments). We believe that there are several misunderstandings in the reasons listed in the remarks. First, university students studying education are not only preparing to become teachers. Second, we believe that the employment problem of students specializing in education is the problem of the entire education field, which cannot be solved by reducing the school to a department. Furthermore, the significance of establishing the Education School is due to the development of modern educational science. Fields such as educational administration and educational psychology have become research systems, which cannot be covered by a single department. In terms of our country's needs, it is even more necessary to value educational science, because the bankruptcy of education is a problem of the entire society. However, the lack of educational administration talents and the ignorance of educational methods are also a major reason. Regarding the Law School, our opinions are also slightly different from Minister Zhu's. First, Minister Zhu said that the National Government is located in Nanjing, and the implementation of politics originates from here. We are not sure what relationship this has with the merger of the Law School and dare not speculate. University education is not entirely limited to applied fields, but is more important for the creation of specialized scholars. For example, taking the economics department, it seems better to be located in Shanghai, the financial center of the country, than in the capital. Famous jurists and lawyers also live in Shanghai more often, so whether the Law School should be located in the capital is quite questionable. In terms of the principle of abolition and merger, according to Minister Zhu, departments and schools that overlap in the same region should be merged, but the result is exactly the opposite. There is no Education School or Law School in Shanghai National University other than Jinan University. On the contrary, Jinan University already has a well-established Business School, but now a new independent Business School has been established in Shanghai, which is not a duplication. As for saying that Jinan University must adopt a policy of austerity and concentration in order to ensure educational efficiency, what does "middle" mean? How to "concentrate"? The remarks did not explain. Looking at the effect of austerity from the perspective of funding, it is also questionable. Jinan University can certainly save money by tightening its belt, but wouldn't Zhongda have to increase because of expansion? Furthermore, although the Law and Education Schools of Jinan University are abolished and merged, the basic subjects of the two schools, such as political economy and other social sciences, as well as psychology and teaching methods, still need to be established and still require considerable funding. In addition, there is one more point, that is, such a major reform of a university must be discussed with the school authorities in advance. If the school's plan for the coming year is gradually implemented, and then it is suddenly greatly changed, then the fact is that it is very difficult. Jinan University's enrollment is about to close, and the letters of appointment for next year's professors have already been issued. This kind of disregard for practical difficulties seems to be insufficient to show respect for education and the intention to reform education. We are sincerely supportive of the government's and Minister Zhu's intention to reform education, but we hope that on the one hand, we will work hard to reform, and on the other hand, we should also consider the actual situation. We hope that Jinan University can take into account the facts of the school and properly plan a good solution.</p>
<p>Summary of the Performance Evaluation of Municipal Schools in the 20th Year</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education is required to conduct an annual assessment of the performance of municipal school principals at the end of the academic year. According to the results of this year's assessment, among the city's more than 180 schools, those whose terms have expired and should be reappointed are: 17 schools whose first phase of one-year service has expired, and 14 schools whose second phase of two-year service has expired. Specifically, with the exception of the South District, there are no changes in the municipal primary schools in the Shanghai South District. Ruan Xingzhi, the principal of the South District Primary School, has repeatedly requested to resign last year, but the Education Bureau has instructed him to stay. Now the principal has resolutely resigned, and Director Xu of the Education Bureau has failed to persuade him to stay and has approved his resignation. He has selected Cheng Minkai, the principal of Zhenxiu Primary School, who has worked hard in school management, to be transferred to the South District. Chen Xiangxin, the principal of Wusong Primary School, has been transferred to Zhenxiu, and Chen Liqing, the principal of Yinxie Primary School, has been transferred to Wusong. Chen Shouzhi, the principal of Gaoqiao Primary School, has been transferred to Yinxie, Su Shude, the principal of Tangyan Primary School, has been transferred to Gaoqiao, and Jin Xuanlun, the principal of Gucun Primary School, has been transferred to Tangyan. Most of them are promotions. The principal of Gucun Primary School will be replaced by a qualified person appointed by the Education Bureau. Regarding the municipal schools in Zhabei District, temporary primary schools have been newly established in accordance with the temporary reorganization plan after the January 28th Incident. The principals have been appointed to be responsible for the reorganization and opening of the schools. Regarding the municipal schools in rural areas, Zhao Tizhen, the principal of Jincheng Primary School, has resigned and has been replaced by Shi Hengsheng, the principal of Xigou Primary School. In addition, principals of various primary schools in rural areas have been dismissed for poor management, ineffective school management, or dereliction of duty, or for gambling. There are 11 schools in total, most of which are single-grade primary schools. The Education Bureau has appointed qualified personnel to replace them. There are also several schools that have been mutually transferred. It is also reported that Wang Wenbin, the principal of Hongbei Primary School, Feng Yi, the principal of Hongxi Primary School, Zhang Dingpei, the principal of Jiangqiao Primary School, Yang Huaichun, the principal of Yangen Primary School, have all achieved good results and have been commended by the Education Bureau.</p>
<p>New Plan for the First Municipal Experimental Primary School</p>
<p>Jia Yin Appointed Principal</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Municipal Experimental Primary School is one of the educational experimental institutions specially established by the Municipal Bureau of Education. Therefore, the Bureau of Education attaches great importance to it, and the Ministry of Education also pays close attention to it. The school's experiments in the past few years have focused on gifted children. However, this is an initiative in educational experiments in various countries, and the results obtained have not yet been determined. The Bureau plans to formulate a new plan for the coming year, expand the scope of the experiment, and pay attention to the selection of principals. Special standards have been set, and only those with the following qualifications can be appointed: (1) Must have graduated from a university education department or a higher normal school and have received higher education training; (2) Must have been in charge of an experimental primary school for more than three years and have achieved results; (3) Must have insights and writings on primary school education and be rich in educational research. It has now been decided to select Jia Yin as the principal. Mr. Jia graduated from the Education Department of National Higher Normal School and has served as the director of the Taicang Education Bureau, the director of moral education of Jiangsu Provincial Fourth Middle School, the director of the affiliated primary school of the Education Department, the principal of the experimental primary school of Jiangsu Provincial Taicang Middle School, the secretary of the Fujian Education Department, the director of the primary education department, the local education guidance, and a teacher and lecturer at the Fujian Local Administrative Personnel Class A Training Institute. He has rich experience and writings. He has written 22 books, 18 papers, and 3 translations, which meet the above standards very well. The Municipal Bureau of Education has already appointed him. It is reported that Mr. Jia has come to Shanghai to take over.</p>
<p>Vacancy for Principal Li of He'an Primary School</p>
<p>Principal Chen of Feihong Transferred to Fill the Position</p>
<p>Xu, Director of Academic Affairs of Feihong, Promoted to Principal</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) He'an Municipal Primary School is one of the largest municipal schools, with 18 classes and nearly 1,800 students. Principal Li Bojun, formerly the principal of Yangzheng Primary School, has been working hard to reorganize the school since he was transferred by the Municipal Bureau of Education last year. Although it has only been a year, the school has made many improvements. Recently, due to the end of the semester, Principal Li returned to his hometown to rest for a while and suddenly contracted typhoid fever and died. After receiving the news, the Education Bureau unanimously believed that the principal was excellent in learning and knowledgeable, had a good way of managing the school, and did not shirk his responsibilities. He was deeply relied upon. Now he has died of an epidemic, and everyone is saddened. However, it is reported that the Education Bureau attaches great importance to the school, and after much consideration, it has been decided to appoint Chen Kunzhen, the principal of Feihong Primary School, as the successor. Principal Chen has been working in municipal schools for many years and has always achieved good results. He has always had a close personal relationship with Principal Li, and they often discussed and studied together on improving school affairs and all teaching plans. He also often visited the school's faculty and staff. Now that Principal Li has a vacancy, Principal Chen's appointment will definitely continue to implement the plan to improve He'an Primary School, so as to achieve the effect of ease and familiarity. The position of principal of Feihong Primary School will be succeeded by Xu Ziling, the director of academic affairs of the school, as decided by the Education Bureau, in order to have a skilled person take over. The appointment orders have been issued.</p>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Education</p>
<p>Summer Workshop Scheduled to be Held</p>
<p>From August 17th to 27th</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the war on various schools this year, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has shortened the summer vacation period. Therefore, the routine 3rd Summer School will be changed to a Summer Workshop, starting on August 17th and ending on August 27th. Elementary school teachers must supplement three subjects at present: (1) Elementary School Physical Education; (2) Elementary School Labor; (3) Elementary School Hygiene. All principals of municipal single-grade primary schools and those who teach elementary school physical education, labor, and hygiene in private primary schools throughout the city must attend the lectures. The lecturers are all contemporary elementary school experts and are rich in practical experience. It is reported that the lecturer for elementary school physical education is Chen Kuisheng, who graduated from the physical education department of the National Higher Normal School and has served as a teacher in primary and secondary schools in various provinces and cities, as well as a referee in various National Games and the 8th Far Eastern Games.

<p>Tongji Students Retain President Hu</p>
<p>The Student Association of the Medical School of National Tongji University wrote a letter to retain President Hu Shuhua, saying: "Respected President Hu Shuhua, we are writing to inform you that we were surprised to read in the newspaper on the 26th that Hunan Province has hired you to serve as the president of Hunan University. Since you have been the president of our school, you have spared no effort in construction and rectification. Even under extremely difficult financial circumstances, our school has been able to continue to teach and make progress. Looking at the recent trend of unrest in national universities, it is far better than others. This is because of your high moral standing and the cooperation between teachers and students. Now that the wounds of the school have not yet healed, there is still much that needs your hands to build. How can you leave at this time, leaving us in a state of panic, as if we were leaving a loving mother? We implore you not to accept other appointments and to devote yourself to bringing glory to Tongji. Then not only will we be fortunate, but the future of Tongji will be truly dependent on it. We respectfully wish you well."</p>

<p>Mingde Girls' School Relocates</p>
<p>The Mingde Girls' School, founded by the Shanghai Flour Exchange and the Brokers' Association, has achieved great success for nearly ten years. Now, because the original school site is insufficient, a building at Huajinfang Mansion on Huajin Road in the city has been selected as the new school building. The location is convenient for transportation and the environment is quiet. There is also a sports field, school garden, auditorium, and library, all of which have been arranged. Yu Chuanding, the director of moral education of Kunfan Girls' Middle School, has been invited to serve as the director of moral education, and Sun Ruzhong, who has served as the director of academic affairs in primary and secondary schools in the city for more than ten years, has been appointed as the director of academic affairs.

<h3 id="e79">Minister of Finance Song Flew to Beijing Yesterday Morning <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Advisor, Dana, Accompanying</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen came to Shanghai this time to confer with important personnel from the customs and taxation departments and various financial circles on how to deal with the rebellion seizing customs duties in the Northeast, discuss methods for abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan, and plan for the increase of 1.5 million yuan in the anti-banditry funds that were previously discussed with President Wang in Shanghai. Most of the important issues have been settled, so Mr. Song took Mr. Zhang's private plane to Beijing at 5:15 AM yesterday morning, accompanied by Zhang Xueliang's advisor, Dana, and others. The matters discussed by Mr. Song with various circles in the city before leaving Shanghai and the circumstances of his departure are recorded below:</p>
<p>Important Meetings Held Before Leaving Shanghai After Mr. Song came to Shanghai this time, he held meetings for several days with Vice Minister of Finance Zhang Shouyong, Jianghai Customs Supervisor Tang Haian, Chief Inspector of Customs Meierhe, Director of the Customs Affairs Department Zhang Fuyun, Chinese and foreign advisors from the customs and taxation departments, and financial circles such as Yu Qiaqing, Bei Songsun, Li Fusun, and Hu Mengjia to discuss customs duties, the abolition of the tael and the replacement of the yuan, and various important financial issues, all of which have yielded considerable results. At about 9:30 PM the night before last, Mr. Song and others held another important meeting at the Chief Inspector of Customs Office on Hart Road. Those present included Zhang Shouyong, Meierhe, Zhang Fuyun, Tang Haian, and western advisor Yang Ge and other eight people. According to the results of the meeting, it is said that some important principles have been decided. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Chief Inspector of Customs Meierhe yesterday to inquire about the course of the meeting. Because Meierhe did not want to publish anything about this, he asked various parties for information on how to deal with the problem of the rebellion seizing customs duties in the Northeast. It was decided to blockade the Northeast customs and publish a declaration on the blockade of the customs in the three northeastern provinces. As for the various measures to be taken after the blockade of the Northeast customs, specific measures have also been drafted. Due to his eagerness to leave Shanghai, Mr. Song has temporarily handed over the tasks of Shanghai negotiations to Vice Minister of Finance Zhang Shouyong to carry out separately, so as to implement them in the near future.</p>
<p>After Arriving in Beijing, He Will Go to Wuhan and Then to Peiping Because Zhang Xueliang, the Pacification Commissioner of Peiping, is very concerned about the Japanese army's ambition to attack Rehe and because the rebellion's seizure of customs is urgent, he specially sent his Western advisor, Dana, on Zhang's private plane from Beijing to Shanghai the night before last. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Dana immediately met with Mr. Song to report on everything and was ordered to invite Mr. Song to go north to discuss matters. Therefore, Mr. Song took the original plane to Beijing at 5:15 AM yesterday morning. In addition to Zhang's advisor Dana, Qin and Chen's secretaries and Shen Qingyi, an advisor to the Ministry of Finance, also accompanied him. After arriving in Beijing, Mr. Song will visit President Wang to report on everything and will then take the original plane to Wuhan to visit Chiang and then go north to visit Zhang.</p>
<h3 id="e80">News from Outside the Pass: Suspension of Postal Services <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Original Bureau for Refund of Three Provinces Drafts</p>
<p>Faster Postal Routes Available in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>Following the government's order to block postal services in the Northeast, postal services in the three provinces have been terminated, and all personnel are entering the Pass in succession. The following is a record of yesterday's news:</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Bureau News: Regarding the suspension of postal services in the three northeastern provinces, a notice was issued on Sunday (the 24th), announcing the complete suspension of drafts issued by the bureaus in those three provinces, parcels sent to those provinces, and all other postal items. The public is further reminded that drafts issued by those bureaus will no longer be honored. The original payment amount should be claimed directly from the issuing bureau by the purchaser. Furthermore, mail transported via Siberia should (unless otherwise notified) be rerouted via the Pacific Ocean or the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>Lin Shi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning: Lin Shi, Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications, has been making great efforts to deal with the situation since the rebels seized postal services in the Northeast. After the Ministry of Communications announced the blockade of postal services in the Northeast on the 23rd of this month, he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning, as Shanghai is the national postal center. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Lin met with Huang Naishu, Director-General of Posts, to conduct a thorough study of the various measures to be taken after the blockade of postal services in the Northeast, and has drafted a number of concrete plans.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Yaoting's Remarks: According to the Datong News Agency, Liu Yaoting, Deputy Postal Director of the Shenyang Postal Bureau in the Liaoning area, paid a visit to Huang Naishu, Director-General of Posts, after arriving in Shanghai, to report on the events leading up to the blockade of postal services in the Northeast and the arrangements for postal workers to enter the Pass in batches, providing a detailed account. However, Mr. Liu, deeply affected by the difficulties he faced in Shenyang, and exhausted from the journey, is now suffering from dysentery. He has been granted leave by the General Bureau for temporary recuperation. A Datong News Agency reporter met with him at his residence yesterday. According to Mr. Liu, he took a train from Shenyang on the morning of the 16th and stayed briefly in Beijing and Tianjin to coordinate arrangements for postal workers entering the Pass. He arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 24th (Sunday). He added that he could not disclose the current situation of postal services in the Northeast at this time, but it was generally the same as reported in the newspapers. At the time, a senior official from the Shanghai Postal Bureau was also present and made two points to the reporter: (1) There are more than 30,000 postal workers nationwide, but only over 2,000 in the Northeast. The report that there are over 30,000 postal workers in the Northeast is incorrect. (2) The Postal Director of Shenyang, Mr. Balidi, and the Postal Director of Harbin, Mr. Sismis, will only begin their journey into the Pass after all postal workers from the Northeast have entered the Pass. They are currently still in their respective bureaus, handling the final arrangements. The reporter also learned that Mr. Liu is from Henan Province and was appointed as Deputy Postal Director of Shenyang in the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic of China, having stayed in Shenyang for more than three years. His family was also in Shenyang but have since followed Mr. Liu to safety in Beijing.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Gather in Four Locations: Postal workers from the three provinces are entering the Pass on orders, but not as a single unit. Instead, travel expenses are issued by each postal bureau, instructing them to travel separately to four locations: Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai. The bureau also provides travel expenses for reaching one of these four locations. As of yesterday, the General Bureau had not received reports on how many of the approximately two thousand postal workers from outside the Pass would be assigned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Glimpse of the Postal Union Regulations: Regarding the Japanese government's introduction of the puppet Manchukuo to join the Universal Postal Union, a person in charge of the General Postal Bureau stated that, according to the regulations of the Postal Union, joining the Union requires the introduction of three member states. As only Japan is acting as the introducer, this does not fully comply with the regulations. Without joining the Postal Union, not only would its issued stamps be equivalent to invalid stamps according to regulations, but it would also be fundamentally unable to qualify for exchanging mail with member states.</p>
<p>Faster Postal Route in Southeast Asia: According to the "North China Daily News,"</p>
<p>Since the blockade of postal services in the Northeast, mail to Europe has been rerouted by sea, which takes several days longer than taking the Siberian route. However, there is an even faster postal route than the Siberian route that may not be well known to the public. The Netherlands has recently opened a regular air route between Batavia (Java) and Amsterdam. Light mail, such as letters, sent from Shanghai via this route can reach Europe in 18 days. The connecting method is to send the mail by ship to Java or Singapore, and then connect with the Dutch air route in Batavia or Alorstar. The Batavia-Amsterdam air route is one of the longest air routes in the world and has been operating for several years, but it is little known in China. Its history dates back to 1924 when a Dutch aviator flew a single-engine plane from Amsterdam to Batavia, encountering several obstacles along the way and arriving in 24 days. Three years later, the famous Dutch aviator Koopman flew again, this time in a three-engine plane, and completed the journey smoothly from the Netherlands to Java in just 12 days, and the return journey was even faster, taking only nine days, setting a new world record at the time. In 1931, this record was broken. Subsequently, a subsidiary company was established in Java, named the Dutch East Indies Airlines, with four aircraft. After a third test flight on November 1, 1929, regular flights began, operating every 14 days, carrying passengers and mail. At the time, the Dutch postal authorities, to facilitate the public, provided very light airmail stationery and envelopes and charged very low airmail rates, but only for light mail. Parcels and heavy mail still had to be transported by sea. On October 1, 1930, the service was changed to once a week to facilitate transportation, which almost doubled the amount of mail carried. The flight time has also been shortened, with Batavia to Amsterdam taking only nine days, and the flights are very stable. In the three years since its opening, there has only been one incident, and the mail was not damaged, only delayed by five days. Currently, flights depart from Amsterdam every Thursday and arrive in Batavia the following Friday, and depart from Batavia every Friday and arrive in Amsterdam the following Saturday. Recently, the company plans to use new aircraft to shorten the flight time, hoping to reach the destination in five days. As for the connection between China and this air route, a Hong Kong-Singapore air route could be opened to connect directly with Java, and if it were extended further north to Xiamen and Shanghai, mail sent from Shanghai could reach Europe in at most ten days in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Japanese Residents to Mail to Northeast <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Acceptance to Begin Today</p>
<p>Mailboxes Added at the Bund Wharf</p>
<p>Japanese Ships to Dalian to Sail Every Three Days</p>
<p>Since our blockade of the postal bureaus in the Eastern Provinces, Japanese residents in Shanghai have been extremely panicked and have been discussing countermeasures for days, planning to first organize a temporary postal bureau to deal with the situation. Although the spokesperson of the Japanese Consulate has repeatedly denied this, the Japanese residents still held a meeting yesterday to discuss solutions. Our authorities believe that such actions by the Japanese residents would be illegal, so they have dispatched personnel to investigate secretly. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting of Japanese Residents: According to the Far East News Agency, in order to establish a temporary communication mechanism with the puppet Manchukuo in the future, and to counter our blockade policy, the Japanese residents of this port have been holding meetings for several days. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., the acting chairman of the administrative committee of the Japanese Residents' Association, Yasui, the chairmen of the various chambers of commerce, Lin Xiongji, and members of the Current Affairs Association, etc., convened a meeting at the Japanese Club to discuss the matter. The meeting did not end until 6:00 p.m. According to Japanese newspaper reporters, a concrete plan has been decided as a result of the meeting, roughly deciding to set up a transportation agency to accept letters to Manchuria. In name, they will try to avoid names such as "postal bureau" so as not to conflict with international law and the Universal Postal Union. This agency will be located in the Japanese Club or the General Assembly of the Residents' Association, and personnel who previously worked in the Japanese Residents' Postal Bureau in this port during the strike of our postal workers will be hired to handle all mailing work, so as to ensure familiarity, and efforts will be made to transfer several postal workers from Japan to assist. The responsibility for transporting the letters will be borne by the Dalian Steamship Company and the Shanghai branch of Nippon Yusen Kaisha. They will also maintain close contact with Japanese residents in Tianjin and Dalian, and have already sent telegrams to solicit methods and opinions from both places. It is said that they will also send personnel north to make contact if necessary.</p>
<p>Dalian Ships Handle Delivery on Behalf: This newspaper reporter has learned that the collection and delivery of mail to the Northeast and Siberia by the Japanese has been confirmed as of yesterday, and will be handled by the Shanghai-bound ships of the Dalian Steamship Company, which is run by the South Manchuria Railway. It is stipulated that Shanghai can send and receive every three days. Secondly, yesterday the Dalian Steamship Company received a telegram from its headquarters, instructing that the mail room on the ship be enlarged starting from today's departing ship, and a special commissioner be appointed to manage postal affairs.</p>
<p>Mailboxes Set Up at the Wharf: Yesterday, the Dalian Steamship Company added mailboxes on the Bund wharf, specifically for mailing mail to places such as the three northeastern provinces, Harbin, and Siberia. The establishment of a postal bureau may cause international disputes, so a person has been specially dispatched to the wharf to be responsible for collecting letters, in effect having a postal bureau without the name of one. In terms of procedures, it is taking a shortcut.</p>
<p>Acceptance to Begin Today: The Japanese will begin collecting mail to the Northeast from 8:00 a.m. today at the Bund wharf. It is said that the postage for mail to Siberia was originally set at 25 cents per ounce, but is now reduced to 14 cents, and no stamps will be affixed. Instead, a stamp will be applied by the collection office. Yesterday, many people went to the Dalian Steamship Company on Sichuan Road to mail letters to the Northeast. In addition to instructing them to go to the Bund wharf to deliver them, the company issued a notice stating that the company does not accept letters to the three northeastern provinces, etc. The first batch of mail collected on behalf of the company today will be delivered to Dalian tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. by the Dalian Maru ship, and then forwarded to various places in the three northeastern provinces, Harbin, and Siberia.</p>
<p>Provisional Delivery Method Set: Currently, it is provisionally stipulated that postal services to the Northeast can be provided every three days. Secondly, they will not be collected and delivered every day, but will be collected and delivered one day on the morning after the Dalian Steamship arrives in Shanghai. The second batch of letters to the Northeast will be collected on the 31st and sent out on August 1st by the Fengtian Maru ship. As for mail from various places in the Northeast to Shanghai, it will also be carried by the company's ships and then forwarded by personnel.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union cabled Zhang Xueliang in Beiping yesterday, saying, "National Emergency, To His Excellency General Zhang Xueliang, Pacification Commissioner of Beiping, The Japanese army is plotting to take Rehe imminently. That place is a crucial pass to North China. If it is lost, the defenses will be breached, and the entire Beiping-Tianjin region will be exposed to invasion. If you continue to act leisurely, it will be impossible to recover. We hope that you will no longer miss opportunities and repeat past mistakes. Please make a decisive decision and personally lead your elite troops to rush to support. Order mobilization and unite to resist Japan. Then the Japanese bandits can be wiped out, Rehe can be defended, and there is hope of recovering the lost territories of the three provinces. The matter is urgent, the disaster is imminent. Success or failure, merit or demerit, depends on this one action. We express our views frankly, and we hope you will understand. Shanghai General Labor Union, bows respectfully."</p>
<p>Another cable from the Federation of Labor Unions to the Central Government says, "To the National Government, the Military Commission, the Pacification Commissioners of various provinces, and the commanders of various armies, divisions, and brigades, Since the brutal Japanese invasion of the Northeast, the authorities have opened the door to welcome the invaders, and the important border areas of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces have been lost. A year has passed, and the lost territories have not been recovered, while the brutal Japanese ambition has not ended. They are again invading Rehe with heavy troops, to fulfill their desire to invade Beiping and Tianjin. If we continue to procrastinate and make mistakes, the nation will be destroyed soon. We urge your government to order Zhang Xueliang to personally lead the Northeast Army out of the Pass on a fixed date to resist the brutal Japanese, in order to atone for past mistakes. Order the Pacification Commissioners of various provinces and the commanders of various armies, divisions, and brigades to mobilize the entire nation and unite to resist Japan, vowing to drive the Japanese invaders out of the three islands, and not to lose an inch of our territory. Our one million laborers in Shanghai will spare no sacrifice and are willing to provide support to achieve the original intention of resisting Japan and saving the country. The survival of the nation depends on this one action. We hope that you will carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages. Shanghai Federation of Labor Unions, bows respectfully."</p>

<p>Willing to Work Hard to Defend Ourselves</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Association, due to the emergency in Rehe and the invasion by Japanese bandits, cabled Zhang Xueliang, the Pacification Commissioner of Beiping, urging him to resist Japan with real strength and not repeat past mistakes, which would plunge the country into an abyss of no return. We have now received a reply from Zhang, saying, "To the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Association, I have read your cable. Your patriotic enthusiasm is greatly appreciated. Neighboring insults continue, and the national crisis deepens. As long as there is breath, we vow to defend ourselves. We rely on the entire nation to unite with sincerity to seek final victory. We must work hard in time and encourage each other. Special reply, Zhang Xueliang, bows respectfully."</p>

<p>The National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China cabled, "To the National Government and the people of the whole country, Since the Northeast Incident, it has been ten months. The strong enemy is pressing us urgently, and the people of the country are advocating resistance. Our association believes that dealing with the national crisis is a matter of utmost urgency, and we have made repeated arguments. Most recently, on the 8th of this month, in view of the dangerous situation in North China, we also telegraphed the whole country, clearly listing five measures: arresting traitors, appointing special commissioners, concentrating troops, uniting friendly countries, and organizing the people (suspected omission of words). We hope you will understand. Unfortunately, our prediction has come true, and the Japanese army has attacked Chaoyang, and airplanes have harassed us. We are heartbroken to hear this. Although the government and local military and political authorities have said that they will resist and coexist with Rehe, we have not yet heard of any comprehensive plan for the whole country to resist the enemy. If there is no sufficient preparation for military affairs, how can we quickly respond to the crisis? If there is no overall planning for resisting the enemy, how can we come up with a foolproof plan? Now that the signs have appeared and the disaster is deepening, there is no room for maneuvering. Our association once again reiterates our proposal, and we ask the government to resolutely implement resistance, with the aim of recovering the lost territories and the method of concentrating all our strength. Adopt and implement the five measures mentioned in the previous cable. The people of the whole country should also unite and work together to promote the spirit of the nation and maintain the integrity of the country. The people of the country have always been united in patriotism. Time is running out, and we should rise up quickly. We express our views with tears, and we hope you will understand. The National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China, bows respectfully."</p>

<p>Rice from Hunan and Anhui is Only Two Yuan Per Dan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Soy and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association yesterday, saying, "We have learned that the price of rice in Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces is extremely low, only two yuan per dan, while rice merchants in our city are still rushing to purchase foreign rice. On the one hand, this affects the rural economy, and on the other hand, it cannot suppress unnecessary leakage of national wealth. The national economy and people's livelihood are harmed. Therefore, we are writing to your association to inform all members that they should give priority to purchasing domestic rice in the future. If there are any difficulties, we hope you will inform us at any time so that we can find a solution. We are most grateful."</p>

<p>Investigating Goods Continuously Transported by Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>The supply of foreign rice in Shanghai has been crowded this year, but sales are sluggish, and market prices are gradually declining. The price of small twisted rice has fallen to 8.67 yuan, but the sales path remains stagnant. There are currently more than 1.6 million bags of rice stored in various warehouses. Due to the hot weather, the rice is piled up and not moving, with some stored in warehouses for five, six, eight, or nine months. It is feared that if it is not sold for a long time, it will become moldy. Therefore, various warehouses are informing the owners to take the goods. Among the rice stored in various warehouses, half is rice transported by Japanese merchants. Upon learning of this, the rice industry association immediately refused to buy and sell it, and the association held a meeting to discuss measures to crack down on inferior goods. Fearing that the members would secretly trade with them, the association has warned all members. However, Japanese merchants secretly entrusted brokers to sell the rice, promising high profits and reducing the price to 8.1 yuan. Recently, certain firms in the Wanyu Wharf in Nanshi have bought the rice at this price, hoping to make a profit by selling it. The matter was heard by the industry, and the firms were advised not to buy inferior goods. The association has held a meeting to break off economic ties with Japan, and our members must not violate this and must abide by the resolutions. On the one hand, they are investigating the brokers who handled the transactions and the amount of goods in order to report to the association for disposal.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, considering that the Northeast Volunteer Army generals Ma Zhanshan, Ding Chao, Li Du, Wang Delin, Cheng Zhangkui, Zhang Yebang, and others have successively sent representatives or personally come to Shanghai for assistance, and at the same time, the situation in Rehe is becoming increasingly tense and the national crisis is becoming more urgent, feels the need to provide substantial and material assistance to these armies as soon as possible. Therefore, it was proposed at yesterday's 32nd executive director meeting. After auditing, the total amount of funds raised at various collection points in Shanghai was more than 35,000 yuan. It was unanimously decided to allocate 30,000 yuan to a certain general familiar with the situation in the three northeastern provinces, who will use all the funds to quickly purchase bullets and distribute them equally to the armies for long-term resistance against the enemy.</p>

<p>Construction Completed, No Worries for the Autumn Floods</p>
<p>The sea embankment in the Gaoqiao East Embankment area of this city suffered from strong winds and heavy rains last autumn, which eroded and damaged the sea embankment. At that time, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works sent personnel to repair it as a temporary expedient. This year, the Bureau of Public Works, in view of the dangerous situation last year, is taking precautions and making long-term plans. Bidding began on June 1st, and construction started on June 6th, divided into nine sections. Seven sections from the "Ai" section to the "Qiang" section were completely rebuilt as stone embankments. The "Rong" section to the "Xia Er" section, which were originally concrete embankments, have also been repaired. The nine sections total 1,700 meters, 11,100 cubic meters, and the total cost is 550,000 yuan. The municipal government has now allocated 250,000 yuan, and the remaining funds will be allocated by the Embankment Works Committee and other sources. The plan is to complete the rebuilt stone embankments in seven phases and the repaired embankments in five phases. It is expected that all will be completed in one month. Although the Public Works personnel are scorched by the sun, their work has not been interrupted, and half of the work has already been completed. If the rain does not cause any hindrance, it will be possible to complete all the work according to the steps. According to the Bureau of Public Works, if this project is done well, there will be no worries about the autumn floods this year.</p>

If the aforementioned assemblies and associations occur, proper persuasion and mediation should be carried out in advance to resolve disputes. This is of utmost importance,' etc. We have received this order.

<p>Requesting Prompt Refund of Overcollected House Tax</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "Regarding this matter, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Federation Hongkou District Branch Office, which states: 'The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession levies a municipal general tax based on rent, and the citizens comply. What else can be said? Since last year, the Public Works Bureau, in order to increase revenue, has arbitrarily increased rents and imposed harsh taxes, which has greatly harmed businesses. According to a report from the Wuchang Road Branch, Dexintang, located at 537 Wuchang Road, has two buildings with a monthly rent of 148 taels. They were forced to pay 56 taels per month, totaling 48 taels and 3 qian in silver. In addition to the 41 taels, 4 qian, and 4 fen that should be paid, they were overcharged 6 taels and 8 qian and 6 fen. This kind of overestimation of rent and tax collection is illegal and unreasonable, and it is infuriating. We demand negotiations to return the extra money in full in order to demonstrate justice. The 16th joint meeting resolved to send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to strongly protest and punish the tax collectors in order to maintain the credibility of the Public Works Bureau,' etc. The overestimation of rent and tax collection will unduly increase the burden on taxpayers. If this is not stopped, the consequences will be dire. We are responding to the situation by requesting that your association seriously negotiate to prevent this illegal tax collection from happening again in order to avoid many disputes,' etc. The overestimation of rent and tax collection is actually the same as increasing the tax rate. This association has repeatedly sent letters to your bureau to correct this, but it has repeatedly occurred, which is regrettable. In response to the aforementioned letter, we are writing to request that your bureau order the tax office to refund the overcollected 6 taels, 8 qian, and 6 fen to Dexintang.

<p>The Jiangsu Province War Zone Relief Committee sent a letter to various agencies, stating: "Regarding this matter, since the Jiading, Taicang, and Baoshan war zones have experienced the devastation of war, the people have been displaced and migrated, and those who have luckily escaped death are groaning in bed. Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been extremely hot and epidemics have occurred. After a major war, there will inevitably be a major epidemic, and the spread of infection is especially expected. Our association has sent a letter to the National Government's Shanghai War Zone Post-Disaster Preparatory Committee, requesting that the Epidemic Prevention Group find ways to prevent epidemics and establish epidemic prevention hospitals in Jiading, Nanxiang, Huangdu, Baoshan, Kunshan, and other places, and separately dispatch personnel to administer vaccinations. However, the area is vast and the population is large, and it is difficult to provide universal vaccination. Those who die of epidemics in remote areas are still unable to receive assistance. We are deeply worried about this and plan to widely solicit summer emergency medicines for Sha and epidemic diseases from Western pharmacies, Chinese medicine shops, and charitable organizations, and distribute them to disaster-stricken areas and disaster victims as a precautionary measure. We have always admired your enthusiasm for public welfare and your miraculous effectiveness in preparing medicines for Sha and epidemic diseases.

<h3 id="e104">Li Guojie Organizes Specific Plans for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Pained Account of Past Corruption</p>
<p>Detailed Explanation of the Fundamental Reorganization Plan</p>
<p>Submitted to the Supervisor for Approval and Implementation</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the leading shipping enterprise in our country, but it is like a body suffering from a long illness, riddled with holes, on the verge of death, with debts accumulated to over seventeen million taels. Its business has declined to its lowest point, with excessive staff, many dilapidated ships and warehouses, and countless instances of corruption. Since Mr. Li Guojie took office as general manager, he has strived for fundamental reorganization to save shipping rights. He has submitted a report to Chen Fumu, Vice Minister of Transportation and Supervisor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, detailing the current real situation, how to reorganize, and the reorganization plan and implementation steps, offering his opinions for consideration and requesting instructions. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Current Real Situation. The following is respectfully submitted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to report on the real situation, the general overview of the inspection and reorganization since taking office, and a proposed fundamental reorganization plan, requesting review, approval, and implementation. Today's China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is like a body suffering from a long illness, riddled with holes, on the verge of death. Outsiders are unaware of the truth and still believe that it has hidden wealth and regard it as a lucrative post, vying to share in it. Once they enter the company and witness all the abuses, they think of reform but have no time. They personally experience all kinds of difficulties and want to eliminate them but have no power, so they suffer as if bearing a great burden and sitting on pins and needles. Since 1928, although I, Guojie, have remained in the position of chairman of the board, I have had no say in the company's personnel and administration. Everything was isolated. At that time, there was much talk about reorganization, but I never expected that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's condition would become so severe. Since taking office, I have carefully inspected and realized that this disease has penetrated deep into the bone marrow and reached the final and most serious stage, which is far beyond my usual expectations. In terms of debt, it has accumulated to more than seventeen million taels, an increase of more than one-third compared to before. The number is truly alarming. As for interest, some is long overdue and has not been paid, and some has been repeatedly postponed for both principal and interest but has always been in arrears, resulting in creditors constantly demanding payment and leaving no peace. In particular, the HSBC Bank is the largest creditor. Recently, due to the large amount of overdue interest, it has demanded the return of the entire principal and interest of the loan, about seven million taels, according to the original contract. Last year, because it was promised to be repaid by the end of the year, the pressure to repay has become more urgent than before because of the inability to pay. They have the right to dispose of the collateral, and we are in danger of bankruptcy. After repeated negotiations by the board of directors, it is fortunate that there has been no breakdown yet, but how can we continue to evade this with empty words? This is the biggest problem. In terms of business, the main source of income is the cargo carried. However, due to poor communication with merchants, ships often fail to be fully loaded. Furthermore, there are cases of underreporting, understating weight, classifying goods incorrectly and using inaccurate sizes. Bills of lading and customs declarations are often inconsistent. This kind of corruption has been accumulating for a long time, and the leakage is almost half. The branch offices in various ports still use the old system of package payments for cargo freight, or they have switched to reporting actual expenses. There is no unified method. As a result, the cunning embezzle at will, and the weak use the excuse of compensation, deceiving each other, which is very unreasonable. Although there are quotas for cargo brokers to pay for passenger tickets, because the guarantee deposit is too large, they regard it as unchangeable. If there is a surplus, they consider it their private income, and if there is a deficit, they claim that they cannot afford to compensate. Furthermore, because they are greedy for a full load, they overcharge for tickets, and gradually exceed their authority, starting the anchor and berthing at ports. The captain's authority has gradually been taken over by the cargo brokers. As for the collection of small freight fees, the original intention was to prevent the smuggling of brokers, but smuggling has not been prevented and is difficult to prevent. Furthermore, they openly smuggle private goods and seize cabin space, so that each voyage of the ships on the river and sea loses money. Even if they do not lose money, there is not much profit to speak of. In addition, the country is in turmoil, and there are frequent requisitions, with wounded soldiers and scattered soldiers being sent here and there, almost using the ships as homes. Therefore, monthly expenses are high during requisitions, and even the income from ordinary business is often not enough to cover expenses, with a shortfall of tens of thousands. This is the second biggest problem. In terms of personnel, since the division of departments and sections, the number of personnel has been increasing day by day, and expenses have also been expanding. Take the tea servers on each ship as an example, each time a cargo broker is changed, a new group is added. The old ones cannot be removed due to the interference of the labor union. If the handling is too strict, there will be a storm. As a result, the number of staff increases day by day, causing abuses. The heads of various branch offices use the excessive advance payments as a protective talisman. Although they know that they are not very competent, it is not easy to replace them. As for the position of the navigator, it is related to the lives and property of the entire ship. How important it is! The New China ship was wrecked the year before last because of the use of a second mate with no technical experience, causing great damage. However, various parties do not understand and regard the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as an ordinary agency, thinking that it is irrelevant to academics, and they can easily place idle personnel here. As a result, they ask for vacancies, and the gifts pile up. If they are not satisfied, it often causes misunderstandings and severe criticism. This is the third biggest problem. In terms of ships and warehouses, most of them are dilapidated and urgently need repair. An inspection of the existing company ships shows that there are only twenty-five ships, and less than half of them are in good condition and suitable for use. The rest are too old, run slowly, have insufficient tonnage for loading, and consume twice as much coal. In recent years, although they have been repaired from time to time, the materials and labor are all substandard, and the repair costs are wasted. The warehouses and ships are still in the old style and are mostly dilapidated, with limited storage capacity. The authorities groan and become haggard in the midst of economic difficulties. All fundamental plans such as adding ships, building warehouses, and upgrading wharves are beyond their ability. They simply let the new ones gradually become old and the old ones gradually become abandoned. What is even more regrettable is that the central government is thinking about reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but the bad habits of theft and leakage on various ships and warehouses have not been eliminated at all. Not only does the public suffer abuses, but merchants also suffer frequent losses. This is the fourth biggest problem. In terms of assets, whether they are complete shipping assets or various real estate unrelated to the shipping industry, they have not been fundamentally reorganized and are allowed to be abandoned, no different from barren fields. It is a pity. For example, various wharves and docks should have been upgraded and cultivated long ago to exploit the land. However, following the old ways, year after year, what initially would have cost only 50,000 taels to upgrade and build, later increased to 300,000 taels. Now, it is no longer possible to do it for 600,000 or 700,000 taels. Land prices are soaring and changing rapidly. In this intangible way, I don't know how much profit has been abandoned. The wharves and warehouses operated by various foreign companies in our country are not worth mentioning. Just look at the Gonghexiang Wharf near the North Station. Since the upgrade, the tall buildings have stood high and the momentum is magnificent. Compared to it, we should feel ashamed. Also, the houses along Fuzhou Road are small and narrow and urgently need to be rebuilt. Ten-story buildings can be built, with one or two floors for the company's office use, and the rest can be leased at a high price. On the Bund, one can see the tall buildings of various large commercial firms, standing tall and majestic. Compared to these short houses that have not progressed for a long time, it is like wearing worn-out clothes standing next to someone wearing fox fur, which is very shameful. In today's land where every inch is worth gold, there is no plan to develop and generate profits. Only debts are troublesome, and expenses are short. After much thought, I plan to sell some of the assets to obtain a large amount of cash to alleviate the temporary difficulties. Therefore, there is a theory of selling assets to save shipping. I don't know that the company's assets that can be sold are all wharves and land protecting the wharves, which are related to the fate of the shipping industry. It is impossible to sell them. As for assets unrelated to the shipping industry, there are not many of them. At most, the value is only a few million. Furthermore, under the current circumstances of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it is difficult to find a buyer. Moreover, the property deeds have all been pledged to creditors and are subject to restrictions. Even if some property prices are obtained, they must be deducted to repay the debt first. We will still have little left in our hands, only to regret it. Therefore, instead of eagerly seeking ways to generate profits from assets, we only diligently seek to divide the profits of the organization, eating away at the foundation, which is a great taboo in business. This is the fifth biggest problem.</p>
<p>Implementation of Reorganization. The above five problems have either already erupted externally or are still lurking internally, and are enough to lead to the death of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. I, Guojie, see this dangerous situation and feel that I have no way to deal with it. Furthermore, when I was hastily appointed, it happened to be after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, and the financial situation was even more exhausted. The salaries of employees and sailors have been in arrears for almost two months. The company's daily water and electricity and other necessary needs are almost exhausted. Only one coal company is still willing to do business with us. Hardware must be purchased in cash in small quantities. The total amount of repair fees and goods and labor payments owed to various factories is tens of thousands. The cash handed over by the previous general manager was only two thousand or so, while the bad checks were over 400,000, some of which were due and some of which were due soon. I was unwilling to wear a broken hat. In addition, the nature of this company is uncertain, causing many doubts and concerns. Standing on this position, it is even more difficult to cope with, and handling affairs is even more difficult. Only by upholding the spirit of reorganization of the Ministry of Transportation and the supervision, and bearing the earnest entrustment of the shareholders, and remembering the hard work of the ancestors in creating this company, I, Guojie, bear a heavy responsibility for this company, and my fate is closely related to it. Now that I am focusing on reorganization, how dare I be afraid of difficulties and seek complacency? I have to try my best to seek treatment, hoping to achieve a little effect. However, the disease is deep and the accumulation is difficult to reverse. To deal with it perfunctorily will not help, and to apply strong medicine rashly will also lead to disaster. The only plan is to make a fundamental and conscientious plan and gradually seek salvation. The current palliative measures must be carried out step by step in order to be effective. However, it will take time and a longer period. It cannot be fully expressed. It is impossible to cure a dying body with one medicine. It is impossible to run fast with a cane. Now the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has too much debt and too many disputes. Each problem takes weeks or months to find a solution. If the political tide is transferred and the authorities advance and retreat together, the plan will be determined and the foundation will be shaken. I can only respectfully refuse to pay. I will briefly present to you the reorganization process that has been planned and organized in the past three months, starting with palliative treatment. (1) Debt. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's heavy debt and bad credit have been mentioned above. The government has no large amount of money to subsidize, and the shareholders lack the financial resources to increase capital. We have reached the end of our rope. In the business world, only those with strong capital can control everything. Otherwise, they can only rely on personal strength and reputation to deal with all parties. The reason why various creditors are becoming increasingly tight is that they do not trust me, and I have no practical way to inform them. Now, I am contacting various domestic and foreign creditor groups separately, starting with connecting feelings, clearing up misunderstandings, being open and honest, distinguishing between urgency, and negotiating phased repayments. I will also convert various dead debts into living debts. For those assets that were not fully mortgaged before, I will raise some loans to provide turnover, hoping to restore credit. The creditors know that I have a practical solution and show some understanding. Now, the two months' salaries owed to employees and sailors by the previous general manager have been raised and paid, and the overdue checks have also been paid separately. In the midst of the stagnant atmosphere, it is fortunate that a slight sign of life has appeared. (2) Business. I am now supervising the responsible personnel to focus on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Min and Guangdong areas to develop business. On the one hand, I am conscientiously connecting business information and soliciting cargo. On the other hand, I am strictly auditing and preventing embezzlement. Various branch offices and ships and warehouses are gradually being improved. I have also formulated sound and practical measures, and re-measured the cabin space of each ship and set up charts so that the cabin volume and cargo weight can be calculated according to the charts at a glance. Furthermore, the two matters of review and investigation are extremely beneficial to increasing profits and eliminating abuses. I have set up a review team in the secret room of this office, specializing in reviewing all accounts of the company to ensure that there are no omissions. In addition to the inspectors, I have added several investigators who are dispatched at any time to various branch offices and ships and warehouses in foreign ports to conduct detailed investigations of various situations for review. As for coal and hardware and other materials, I plan to take open and direct measures. Coal will be ordered directly from major coal mines, and hardware will also be purchased wholesale from overseas, which should be more cost-effective and avoid various abuses. However, because the financial resources are not yet abundant, I have to temporarily purchase from local companies in small quantities at any time. Since the rectification, the income from passenger and cargo freight in April has been slightly stronger than before. Unfortunately, May and June are slack months, and the central government has requisitioned ships for military transport. The ships on the river and sea are not evenly distributed and cannot actively operate. (3) Personnel. Although the company is now under the supervision of the government, it is a business and not an official position. It must be purely commercialized and managed by scientific methods. Therefore, the use of personnel must be based on talent, and it is important to pay attention to personality and old morality first. If one place does not have the right person, there will be abuses in that place. Therefore, it is better to keep the old staff than to change to new staff, because business is definitely not something that outsiders can handle. Although the heads of various departments and important staff members of the company are not all-rounders, they all have considerable knowledge and solid personality. As for the senior crew members, they will be carefully reviewed in the future to avoid repeating the mistakes of the New China ship. However, there is a great lack of shipping professionals. Not only is it difficult to find management talents, but it is also difficult to use the staff of the engine and driving departments appropriately. Among the engine crew, there are still many who have been promoted from copper craftsmen, which is evident in the difficulty. In the past, we mostly borrowed talents from foreign countries, which caused the sovereignty to fall into the hands of others. If we change to Chinese staff, we are often afraid of making mistakes due to insufficient experience. Now, the shipping department has been ordered to recruit these trainees in stages and send them to various ships for on-the-job training for promotion. It is best to select talents based on qualified examinations, and those who are recommended through connections often cannot avoid the sigh of being a mediocre player in an ensemble. (4) Ships and Warehouses. The dilapidated condition of the company's ships has been mentioned before. If the economy is slightly better, it is necessary to add twenty or thirty new ships in order to turn around freely. Now, we can only consider the situation and repair them separately for temporary use. However, when bidding for tenders, various factories deliberately charged high repair costs, leaving almost nothing to come out. The China Merchants Machinery Bureau in Pudong has been shut down for several months and has not yet resumed work. It has always been convenient to undertake various projects for the company. Therefore, I have allocated funds to order it to resume work and entrusted the New Feng, New Ming, and Tu Nan ships to the factory for repair, one to save repair costs and one to restore the factory's business. There are not many funds, which is a double benefit. Other ships are still planned to be gradually priced to make them complete. The various wharves and docks are also being planned for repair. The Zhonghua North Three Warehouses have always been used to berth foreign ships. Since Zhao, the former general manager, changed to the manager of the Fourth Warehouse, the credit has plummeted, so that foreign merchants are unwilling to insure and banks are unwilling to accept drafts. The Chinese warehouses have been idle for two years and no one has paid attention to them. The business has plummeted. This is not easy to restore without a large amount of capital. Now, the South Warehouse, namely Jinliyuan Wharf, is being used as a model warehouse for preliminary reorganization, banning theft and leakage to benefit merchants. However, the foundation of the wharf is still mixed with the land of Jardine Matheson and Sandetang. Although a lease agreement has been signed, in recent years, disputes have often arisen due to overdue land rent. Fortunately, the address of Sandetang has been purchased by the company and there is no problem. The land of Jardine Matheson, whether leased or purchased, is also under negotiation. The French Concession has recently had negotiations on the garbage wharf problem, which has encroached on property rights. I am also negotiating strongly, and it has not been resolved yet. I will report on the results later. (5) Assets. The total assets of the company are estimated to be worth about 50 million taels according to the current market price. The foundation cannot be said to be weak. It is only that we have not thought about fundamentally generating profits. Although we have huge assets, we are poor day and night, just like the saying "holding a golden bowl and begging for food." Now, I plan to thoroughly liquidate all assets in various ports, regardless of whether they are related to the shipping industry, and plan to run profitable businesses so that there is no abandonment. The annual rental income will gradually increase, and the assets will also increase accordingly. Even if it is absolutely necessary to sell some assets unrelated to the shipping industry in the future, the prices will be better than they are now.</p>
<p>Fundamental Reorganization Plan. In short, to make the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company revive, we must design from the root, without any doubt. The above-mentioned points are only palliative measures. We are reorganizing the current situation, and many of them are things that have been delayed in the past or have been done but not completed. At this time, we have to make up for them one by one. For example, the case of the encroachment on the Lotus Pond property of Zhenjiang, the case of the Tonghua ship hitting and sinking the Xinji Company sailing boat for compensation, and the case of the company's arrears in the price of hardware after the collapse of the Yuanchang Kun Company are all lawsuits that have been going on for years and have been in dispute for months. Some are still in contention, and some have already lost the lawsuit. Now, they are all being cleared up one by one, and the company is not suffering any losses. There are many other kinds of entanglements. I am planning to clear them up one by one. Even the most important budget of the company has not been established. Various important regulations are still lacking. Although they are ordinary things that should be done within the scope of my duties, because they have not been done in the past, it is like creating something out of nothing. It will not be completed without a considerable amount of time. It is like a person who is seriously ill and has been harmed by medicine, or has been delayed for a long time and has suffered from external feelings. We must first slowly relieve the wrong medicine, remove the miscellaneous feelings, and mix it with ginseng porridge to revive it. Then, we can discuss the way to treat the root cause, and we can find a way. Otherwise, a mess of silk threads will be more difficult to clean up. I will respectfully present to you the predetermined direction of progress in the future and formulate a fundamental plan for reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. (1) Increase new capital. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company now wants to restore vitality and activate blood vessels. Without urgently adding capital, it will not be effective. This matter is of great importance. A cup of water is difficult to quench thirst. We must increase new capital of 30 to 50 million to be effective. How easy is it to talk about such a large amount of money? We look to the government and discuss with the shareholders, but we cannot do anything about it. It is almost hopeless in the country. We have no choice but to look to overseas Chinese compatriots, hoping that they have this power. I have seen that in recent years, the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese has been soaring. They often regret that they cannot see the merchant ships of their motherland fluttering the national emblem and galloping in the ocean in distant foreign lands. After the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War, their donations and funds exceeded tens of millions. If we can use this patriotic psychology to add overseas Chinese capital and cooperate with the old shareholders, it is a great opportunity. Moreover, there are many Cantonese shareholders in the company who have close relationships with overseas Chinese merchants, which is easy to approach. I, Guojie, have sent people to discuss this plan with overseas Chinese in the South Seas Islands, and they have all expressed their approval. However, because the nature of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has not been determined and it is in a precarious situation, they have shown some doubts. If someone is responsible, it is not difficult to have a successful hope. (2) Absorb foreign capital. It has long been determined by the government to absorb foreign capital and develop all domestic production industries. Foreign debt is not impossible to borrow, but it must be used for profit. The company's assets are all over the provinces, but they are mostly abandoned because there is no money to cultivate them. If we can use other people's capital to develop for us, the benefits of building what we get are immeasurable. In August 1928, when the Ministry of Transportation convened a national transportation conference, I, Guojie, contributed this idea, planning to use foreign capital to upgrade and build the Zhonghua North Three Wharves as a foundation for promoting foreign shipping. It has already been taken into account. Now, I plan to use the collection of overseas Chinese capital as the body and the borrowing of foreign capital as the use. Recently, there have been several informal contacts with major merchants from various countries to borrow money. It can be realized only if the company's fundamental plan is determined. (3) Expand domestic shipping. Based on the above two plans, if the finances are indeed in order, then we should add dozens of new ships with larger tonnage, open up shipping routes to various ports in the inland rivers and outer seas, build wharves and warehouses everywhere so that they are all brand new, and build docks and add machine factories to expand domestic shipping as much as possible to prepare for recovering shipping rights. (4) Open up overseas shipping. Now, if our country's merchant ships suddenly think of crossing the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and competing with European and American countries, not only do we not have this ambition, but it is also a pipe dream. At this time, we cannot plan broadly, but the South Seas area, Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, Binalanong, Philippines, Java, Batavia, Manila, and other ports, are full of overseas Chinese, and the business is huge. The rice, sugar, coal, tin paper, fur, wood, and groceries produced are the main exports. It is not impossible to open up shipping routes to and from these ports. Therefore, when domestic shipping has gradually expanded, we should expand to various ports in the South Seas. We plan to set two routes first, one from Shanghai through Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, Haiphong, Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, and Binalanong to the west, and the other from Shanghai through Xiamen, Shantou, Singapore, and Batavia to the south. Each route is scheduled to have two ships of 8,000 tons each, sailing on schedule, one to comfort the long-standing desire of overseas Chinese merchants, and one to seek the development of overseas trade, which is a step that should be taken in the plan. (5) Run sea and land intermodal transport. For sea transport, in addition to the major ports in the South Seas, through Annam, Myanmar, and Siam, in the future, there should be direct shipping routes from this company. As for the Philippines, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Manila, and other places, there are overseas Chinese organizations that operate shipping companies, and we should contact them to run intermodal transport to expand business. The North Sea shipping route should be promoted even more. We should contact the Russian commercial fleet company in Vladivostok to run intermodal transport to collect the profits of the Siberian Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway. As for land transport, we should stipulate intermodal transport methods with major railways in the country, properly formulate regulations, and abide by them to show the government's intention to maintain subsidies. (6) Cultivate shipping professionals. The lack of shipping talents is the biggest shame of our country and the reason for the company's decline. Since the closure of the Wusong Merchant Marine School in the first year of the Republic, there has been no place to produce such talents. The scale of the China Merchants Public School is small, and the funding is insufficient. The Huajia Training Ship, which was taken over and continued, was seized by warlords midway, and all the work was wasted. When Zhao, the former general manager, changed to set up a shipping specialty, it was only because of its humble and simple facilities, easy courses, and short-term students, which was not a plan to truly cultivate talents. I, Guojie, believe that in the company's fundamental plan, talents are the most fundamental of the fundamentals. We should urgently establish a most magnificent merchant marine school, with departments of management, navigation, and engine, with at least enough capacity for 1,000 students, and attach several training ships to sail to various ports on the river and sea in stages and train in each class. We must make small achievements within five years, and within ten years, all the talents of the company will be students of this project. We must also follow the precedents of the customs and postal services to formulate treatment and incentive rules to protect the law, make the best use of their talents, use their learning appropriately, and there will be no omissions. To sum up the above six items, if we can follow the Russian Five-Year Plan or the Turkish Three-Year Plan, focus on responsibility, and set a deadline, the company's future will have the hope of rejuvenation. Apart from the nature and status of the company, which will be presented separately, I deeply hope that this fundamental reorganization plan can be deployed by me, Guojie, gradually implemented, guided by your supervision, and that the road will be far away, so that it will not be abandoned halfway, and that the work of building a mountain will not be lost to a basket of soil. I dare not underestimate my ignorance and rudeness. I will carefully present the true state of illness of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the general reorganization situation since taking office, and the proposed fundamental plan to your review, and respectfully request that it be presented to the Minister and instructed to obey. Respectfully presented to Chen, Vice Minister of Transportation and Supervisor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Li Guojie, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<h3 id="e105">[Producing Film on Cholera] <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>At this time when cholera is rampant, the general public is unaware of the source of the disease and methods of prevention. Once infected, they do not know to choose the correct doctor for treatment, resorting to scraping or taking medicines that do not match the symptoms, leading to worsening conditions and counterproductive results, which are common occurrences. Mr. Du Yuesheng, in order to make the general public understand and promote awareness, specially collaborated with the Red Cross Cholera Hospital on North Xizang Road and the Star Film Company to film how cholera spreads, how scraping leads to worsening conditions, and how treatment can lead to recovery. They have been filming day and night at the hospital for several days, capturing all aspects of dietary hygiene, the suffering of infection, the dangers of scraping, and the hospital's facilities, such as ambulances, injections, treatments, emergency shots, and saline drips. Filming has been completed, and it is said that it will be screened soon to broaden publicity.</p>
<p>Treating a Child's Diarrhea with Opium Pods:</p>
<p>Resulting in the Death of the Child</p>
<p>Dai Hegui's five-year-old daughter, Cai Bao, who lived at No. 63 Huanghe Road in the French Concession, recently suffered from severe diarrhea. Her mother, Ms. Song, believing that opium could treat diarrhea, gave the child an opium pod to swallow the day before yesterday. However, the child was young and weak, and the excessive dose caused poisoning, leading to a critical condition. She was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. She died in the hospital at 5:15 yesterday morning. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for examination. Subsequently, the deceased's parents petitioned the police to waive the examination and allow them to handle the matter themselves. The police chief approved their request, and they proceeded to coffin and bury the body in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Eight-Wheel Trolley Cars in the Public Concession:</p>
<p>Started Operating on All Routes Yesterday</p>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Co., Ltd. in the Public Concession, noting the increasing number of trolley car passengers, has not only increased the number of cars on each route but also imitated the styles of Chinese and French concession trolley cars, adding several new-style eight-wheel trolley cars to operate on Routes 1, 2, and 3. Each car can accommodate 50 passengers. It is said that the company is continuing to manufacture these cars to reduce passenger congestion.</p>

<p>Provincial Order Restricting Additional Tax Levies on Land Tax</p>
<p>Recently, additional tax levies on land tax in various regions have often been several times more than the regular tax, increasing the burden on the people year after year. The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday to restrict these levies. The original order stated: "For compliance matters, it is hereby ordered that an investigation reveals that the additional tax levies on land tax in various counties are many times, or at least double, the regular tax revenue, increasing the burden on the people year after year. Strict restrictions are necessary to demonstrate prudence and compassion. It is hereby stipulated that from the 21st year of the Republic onwards, any increase in the burden on the people must first have the proposed project submitted to the responsible department for approval, and then the transferred funds must be submitted to the responsible department for review. If there are no violations, it should then be submitted to the provincial government for discussion to demonstrate restriction. In addition to separate distribution, it is hereby ordered that the county magistrate comply and instruct subordinates to comply without fail. Sincerely, this order, etc., has been received. In addition to separate distribution, it is hereby ordered that the county magistrate comply and instruct subordinates to comply without fail."</p>
<p>Case of Interference with Family and Enticement</p>
<p>Lin Ahua, a native of Ningbo, recently filed a complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Yue Agui, who runs the Xinyi Clothing Store at No. Xin Xin Li on Kim Shenfu Road, of interfering with his family and enticement, among other charges. The court held a hearing yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff stated that he married Yue Xiaoxiang, a 19-year-old cousin of Yue Agui, in the 19th year of the Republic. Later, she was bewitched by the defendant, using the excuse of returning to Ningbo and has been gone for a long time. She came to Shanghai in March of last year and returned to Ningbo in October, encouraged by the defendant. In November, she returned to Shanghai and suddenly disappeared. Later, he learned that she had remarried under the direction of the defendant, thus interfering with his family. He pleaded for punishment, etc. The defendant also entrusted the lawyer Quan Ren to state the defense, claiming that Yue Xiaoxiang is Yue Agui's younger sister, not a cousin. Last October, their mother saw that their relationship was deteriorating and temporarily took her home to ease family disputes, not at the defendant's suggestion. As for encouraging her to return to Ningbo, there was no such thing. Moreover, Xiaoxiang has not remarried. To establish a charge of enticement, there must be enticement. Xiaoxiang came home because of the plaintiff's abuse, and she was advised many times. Xiaoxiang said that if she were to return to the Lin family, she would rather die here. The defendant, out of affection for his sister, temporarily kept and cared for her. How can this be called enticement? Moreover, the word "enticement" refers to inducing and exploiting a person's mistakes while having the power to control them. Now that the defendant has neither induced nor exploited a person's mistakes, how can this be called enticement? Furthermore, Article 13, Paragraph 3 of the General Principles of the Civil Code stipulates that even a minor who is married has the capacity to act and cannot be considered to have committed this crime. Therefore, Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 414 states that once a minor is married, they have the capacity to act and there is no issue of separation from their parental rights. Those who entice underage men and women do not constitute a crime under Article 257 of the Criminal Code, etc. Since further evidence is needed, the hearing was adjourned.</p>
<p>Young Woman Conning for Money</p>
<p>Zhang Guangyu, an employee of the Municipal Bureau of Education, who lives at No. 34 Borton Village on Route du Père Robert in the French Concession, was visited at 10:30 yesterday morning by a young woman, about 27 or 28 years old, with a dark complexion, wearing high-heeled leather shoes, and a new-style white rayon cheongsam, carrying a colorful parasol. She first claimed to be visiting and said that she also worked in the Second Section of the Bureau of Education, and was a colleague of Mr. Zhang. Today, she had taken a day off because her child was sick and was accompanying the child for treatment. She needed to borrow ten yuan because she did not have enough money for medical expenses, promising to return it tomorrow. Mr. Zhang's family knew that there were female employees in the Bureau and, since her story sounded credible, they believed her and paid the amount. When Mr. Zhang returned home from work, his family told him the story, and Mr. Zhang knew that there was no such woman in the Bureau, so he realized he had been cheated. He hopes that people from all walks of life will pay attention and, if similar incidents occur again, detain the woman.</p>
<p>Smuggling and Selling Poisonous Gas Guns Sentenced to Three Years Each</p>
<p>The three Japanese men, Kono, Taniguchi, and Nakama, smuggled poisonous gas guns to Shanghai and colluded with Ningbo native Xu Zailin and Shaoxing native Tian Chunian to sell them secretly. Song Bingzheng, an inspector from the Narcotics Suppression Department of the Public Works Department, along with detectives Ding Yugao and Chen Yaoting, learned of this and apprehended the five Chinese and Japanese smugglers in Room 511 of the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road, confiscating nine poisonous gas guns and over two hundred bottles of poisonous liquid. They were sent separately to the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai and the First Special District Court for detention and trial. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the three Japanese men have been interrogated by the Japanese Consulate and confirmed to have engaged in smuggling. However, they were only detained for one week before being deported back to their country with a light sentence. The poisonous guns and poisonous liquid were returned to the Japanese men to take back to Japan. Yesterday morning, the police, noting that the case of the Japanese defendants had been concluded, escorted the two Chinese defendants, Xu and Tian, to the First Special District Court. Judge Qian conducted the trial. The police lawyer, Lv Rubao, stated that the three Japanese men had been interrogated by the consulate and that the defendants had jointly sold poisonous gas guns, which are prohibited internationally. The evidence was solid, and severe punishment should be imposed. Judge Qian then questioned the two defendants, Xu and Tian, who both confessed without dispute. The court immediately sentenced them each to three years in prison. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed will be deducted from the prison term at a rate of two days for one day. The police lawyer stated that the number of days of detention of each defendant in the capital should also be deducted. The court approved.</p>
<p>Private Primary Schools in the Concession Ordered to Improve</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education, noting that private primary schools in the concession are numerous, has found that while many have registered in accordance with regulations, many others have not completed the registration process. These unregistered primary schools have corrupt practices and numerous shortcomings. If they are not regulated and rectified, it will not only fail to benefit the children seeking education but also disrupt the education system. Therefore, the Bureau has specially selected its employees to conduct inspections by district, eliminating the bad and preserving the good to facilitate improvement. It has been found that the Chengde Primary School run by Zhou Gongxiang at No. 241 South Chengdu Road, the Demao Primary School run by Wang Xungao of Suzhou opposite the Yangshupu Road Foreign Affairs Bureau, the Siming Huaide Primary School run by Zhang Shiqing of Ningbo at No. 238 Changqing Lane on Tongzhou Road, the Jiaotong Primary School run by Xu Jin at No. 38 Wenzhou Road, and the Jiying Primary School run by Zhang Mingyi at No. 395 Qipu Road all have issues such as unclean school buildings, poor teaching methods, or a lack of funding. Some even use the school to collect money under false pretenses. The Bureau Director has sent a written request to the First Special District Court to strictly ban these schools and requested that the ban measures be sent back for review. The court recently issued summonses, delivered by the political department of the General Police Department, sending Detective Pan Lianbi to notify each school principal to appear in court for questioning. However, Xu Jin of Jiaotong has already closed the school and his whereabouts are unknown. The school site has now been changed to Jinling Primary School by Qian Zhifan. Zhang Mingyi of Jiying has also closed the school and Zhang has gone to Wuhan. Therefore, only Zhang Shiqing of Siming and Zhou Gongxiang of Chengde appeared in court yesterday morning. Wang Xungao of Demao sent a lawyer as a representative. Judges Wu Tingqi and Fu Lin opened court in the Second and Fourth Tribunals, respectively, for the trial. Zhang Shiqing admitted that he was willing to improve in the future and comply with all regulations. Zhou Gongxiang requested a two-week deadline to start rectification to comply with the regulations. Wang's lawyer also stated the same. The judges ordered the summoned parties to leave and submit a detailed report on the improvement situation for the Municipal Bureau of Education to review.</p>
<p>Russian Watchman Commits Suicide Due to World-Weariness</p>
<p>The Russian watchman, Kraiteikov, age 31, of the Meiqing Leather Company at No. 400 Qiwupu Road in East Shanghai, previously served as a soldier under Zhang Zongchang. Last year, he was introduced by his friend, Kemmen, to work as a watchman at the company. The Russian man suddenly felt weary of the world because he thought his income was too meager. At around 5:00 AM, he shot himself in the chest with his own pistol in his bedroom, falling to the ground in extreme pain with blood gushing out. Li Haizhu, a Chinese clerk, heard the sound and rushed over, horrified at the sight. He immediately reported to the police, who dispatched Western detective and Chinese detective Ma Wenda to investigate. They found a suicide note in the bedroom, which read, "I never wanted to work here, but I have two beloved dogs, please take care of them." He was then transported to Gongji Hospital, but had already died. The body was taken to the forensic examination center on Fielan Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the First Special District Court came to the center for examination. According to the testimony of witness Li Haizhu, at 5:30 that morning, he was washing his face when he suddenly heard a gunshot from the deceased's bedroom. He rushed to see what had happened and saw the deceased lying on the ground with a gunshot wound. He touched him and felt a faint breath, so he reported to the police. The Western and Chinese detectives reported the details of the investigation and presented the suicide note. The American manager of the Meiqing Company, Mr. Meiersen, stated that the deceased was indeed a watchman for the company and requested to claim the body for burial. Mr. Guo approved, ruling that the deceased Russian, Kraiteikov, had indeed committed suicide with a pistol before his death, and the body was handed over to Mr. Meiersen for burial after he signed a guarantee.</p>
<p>Retrial and Sentencing in the Assassination of Ling Runxiang Case</p>
<p>The case of Ling Runxiang, a Guangdong native and director of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, being assassinated by gunfire at the entrance of Dexing Lane on North Jiangxi Road at 6:00 PM on July 28, 1920. The five Guangdong natives, Ou Zhaocheng (i.e. Ou Zhaocheng), Liu Xizhuang, Luo Baoliang, Ou Chang, and Ou Chuntong were apprehended by Feng Shuofu, a Chinese detective in the Hongkou Police Department, on August 4 of the same year at the Guangwutai Theater in the Chinese territory. They were then handed over to the Garrison Headquarters, sentenced as military prisoners, and sent to the capital for execution. Later, family members hired lawyers to request the Ministry of Military Affairs to send the case to the Jiangning District Court to overturn the original verdict for a retrial. Since the location of the Ling case and the arrest of the criminals, Lu Ju, etc., were all in the Shanghai concession, the court sent the five men to the Hongkou Police Department on June 8 of this year to be handed over to the First Special District Court. After repeated trials, it was found that the murderer was Hu Ying, who was still at large. The court then announced the end of the defense and sentencing process. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin opened court and announced that defendant Ou Zhaocheng was found guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced to twelve years in prison, Liu Xizhuang, Ou Chang, and Ou Chuntong were found guilty of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to five years in prison each, and Luo Baoliang was sentenced to three years in prison. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed will be deducted from the prison term at a rate of two days for one day. The police lawyer stated that the number of days of detention of each defendant in the capital should also be deducted. The court approved.</p>

At the home of Chen Zhou on Mofang Lane, No. 1 in the South City, a fire broke out at 6:30 AM the day before yesterday due to a fire left on a pile of rice straw while cooking breakfast. Neighbors alerted the local fire brigade, which dispatched a truck and extinguished the fire. Only a corner of the roof of the flat house was burned.

<p>Acupuncture Doctor Comes to Shanghai to Practice</p>

<p>The 20th District Branch of the Citizens Association Opposes Telephone Price Increase</p>
<p>The 20th District Branch of the Citizens Association, in response to the telephone price increase in the concession, yesterday specially notified its members to fill out volunteer forms to gather public opinion and negotiate accordingly. It also sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association in the Concession, forwarding it to the Chinese Directors of the Public Works Department for negotiation. The letter stated: "To the esteemed sirs, since the Japanese invasion of Zhabei on January 28, the businesses in our northeastern district have been completely destroyed. Even the shops in the central district, although not directly ravaged by the Japanese, have suffered significant indirect effects due to the stagnation of the market for more than two months. Now, as we are preparing to restore the market and strive for commercial recovery, the realization of the telephone price increase, which is most important to commerce, is causing deep concern. We believe that the telephone is a public utility and has a monopolistic nature. It should strive for the benefit of the public. How can it take advantage of its monopolistic position to seek private gain and implement a price increase, disregarding the interests of the public? At a time when commerce is depressed after the war, increasing the price of telephones is a violation of the original purpose of public utilities. The company claims to be upgrading to automatic machines and intends to pass the cost on to users, but this reason is insufficient. Upgrading to automatic machines is a facility for the company to develop its business. The profits earned over the years should be used for this purpose. Moreover, in the future, as shops find it more convenient to communicate, they will inevitably install telephones, and the revenue will be considerable. In short, such price increases are entirely one-sided. The company is only seeking profit and disregarding the burden on users. The Public Works Department should not disregard the ability of taxpayers to pay, ignore legal principles and human feelings, and rashly approve the increase. We are sending this special letter to your association, requesting that you forward it to the Public Works Department for reconsideration and request the Chinese Directors present to argue strongly for the cancellation of the price increase in order to alleviate commercial difficulties and benefit the market."</p>
<p>Deadline for Registration of Confiscated Goods</p>

(2) To notify the Chamber of Commerce by letter to inform the relevant industries that they have until the end of this month to come to the association to complete registration. No extensions will be granted after the deadline, etc. This is hereby communicated. Please review and forward to your respective industries for compliance and registration before the deadline to avoid further delays.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I read the "Harbor Quarantine Dispute" in your newspaper's local news section, which does not match the facts. According to nautical practice and harbor quarantine regulations, all matters related to the voyage and port quarantine are the responsibility of the shipowner. The reason why the quarantine medical officer ordered the police to detain the Xinfeng was because the chief mate of the ship, Jiang Changqing, was unfamiliar with nautical regulations and disobeyed the shipowner's orders, abusing his authority. Since the January 28 Incident in Shanghai and the subsequent discovery of cholera outbreaks in various ports, all imported ships have been quarantined in the harbor. The number of ships inspected daily often ranges from a dozen to more than twenty. The procedures and methods for quarantine have already been announced in Announcement No. 24 by this office and communicated to Chinese and foreign shipping companies for compliance. The report stated that the Xinfeng arrived at the Jinliyuan Wharf at 8:40 AM yesterday (July 25), but the medical officer of this office did arrive on board at 8:45 AM, without any dereliction of duty. The shipowner's signed document can be used as verification. As they were preparing to implement the quarantine work, the chief mate Jiang came out and rebuked the medical officer of this office for being troublesome and pulled down the quarantine yellow flag. In order to maintain the quarantine regulations and maintain order, the medical officer had to summon the police for protection and reported to the office. Later, Director Wang of the Shipping Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company came to mediate. Director Wu, considering that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-run shipping company and that the ignorant and violating chief mate Jiang is also a fellow compatriot, did not impose strict punishment in order to safeguard the national image and support the younger generation of the shipping industry. He only ordered the chief mate Jiang Changqing to personally apologize to the office to settle the matter. This is the true situation of the dispute from beginning to end. Since this office took over the harbor quarantine, shipping companies from all countries have praised and complied. However, some domestic shipping companies lack this level of awareness and often cause disputes, which is regrettable. Therefore, this office often provides various conveniences to the domestic shipping industry, hoping for cooperation to avoid internal conflicts and ridicule, so as to enhance our international standing. Thinking that your newspaper's editorial standards are high, perhaps the reporting was not detailed enough, leading to errors in transmission. This letter is sent to you in the hope that you will make corrections. Sincerely, Harbor Quarantine Administration, July 26, 21st year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Basic Principles of Railway Responsibility for Transportation Regulations (Continued)</p>
<p>Zheng Baozhao</p>
<p>(G) Special services that the carrier is not required to provide by law. The shipper only has the right to require the public carrier to accept and transport the goods in the usual and customary manner, and cannot force the carrier to provide special services or transport them in a manner different from that used to treat the general public. If any carrier provides any special privilege business due to special contact, it is considered not to be within the scope of its responsibility, to fulfill the obligation of a public carrier, and will not be responsible for the liability of the insurer.</p>
<p>(H) Types of public carriers. The method used by the carrier for transportation is not a condition for determining whether it is a public carrier. The question of whether it is a public carrier depends on whether the carrier is willing to lease freight and transport the goods of the public. The general opinion is that express companies are not public carriers, because express companies do not directly transport the goods themselves, but indirectly transport them through railways, ships, or other carriers. The company itself has no way to intervene, cannot send employees or agents to manage the goods that have arrived, and cannot exercise any supervision over such employees or agents. However, in court, express companies are considered to be public carriers, because the contract for public carriers does not require that the transportation must be completed entirely under the direct guidance and management of the carrier itself. Any public carrier may choose to transport the goods themselves or entrust an agent to transport them under their supervision and management. If the situation exceeds this, a separate contract must be drawn up to specify the details. Therefore, it is appropriate for the court to recognize express companies as public carriers, because although the company itself does not transport the goods, it entrusts railways, ships, or other carriers to transport them under its supervision, which is the same as transporting them themselves. As for the nature of delivery companies, which is quite similar to that of express companies, they are also regarded as public carriers</p>

<p>It seems that even his extravagant wife, capable of squandering his wealth, is merely a tool for him.  Originally, in Shanghai, satisfying one's carnal desires is extremely convenient. As long as your wallet is fat with money, you can have meticulously selected goods to satisfy your needs at any time and any place.  North Zhujia Bridge is a hub of flesh, and Shanghai's most mysterious continent of sex. Today, on his way back from the company, sitting in the No. 2 tram, he thought to himself that he hadn't pursued any "wild flowers" for several days, so he felt somewhat listless. It was still early, so he might as well take a tour of the continent of sex to relieve the boredom of his body and mind. When the tram arrived in front of the Golden Grand Theatre, he got off and headed towards his destination in a few strides.  He stepped into the × Villa, a meat market specializing in providing convenience, especially revered by infatuated men and resentful women. Old Woman Wang, the human matchmaker they were most grateful to, greeted him with a beaming smile and said, "Mr. Xie, why haven't you come these past two days? Have you perhaps turned vegetarian?"  "Vegetarian I am not, I have only been eating home-cooked meals. I have been abstaining from wild delicacies for a few days, making my appetite dull. So, I specially came today to make amends. Quickly pick out a top-notch fresh item for me, to whet my appetite." As he spoke, a face filled with lust displayed an intense eagerness, as if demanding that Old Woman Wang immediately issue the order to mobilize.  In less than a few minutes, a captivating fragrance carrying a strong sexual allure was wafted in from outside, followed by the crisp sound of leather shoes. He looked up and saw Old Woman Wang entering with a beautifully adorned woman. In a very short time, he had assessed her and confirmed that she was indeed a top-notch, authentic Western product. He immediately expressed his utmost satisfaction. After Old Woman Wang introduced them and negotiated a price, they proceeded to perform the art of the flesh.  He and she were engrossed in their pleasure, making rapid progress, performing the ×th kind of × that Dr. Zhang invented, when suddenly he heard a very familiar "Oh dear, oh dear" sound from the next room. He listened intently again, feeling a great surge of anger. He immediately stopped his work, stepped down from the stage of sex, and rushed over in a fluster, kicking the door open. He saw a pair of naked "flesh Buddhas" inside, also performing the art of the flesh. Upon seeing this, his eyes blazed with anger. He suddenly stepped forward, grabbed the female character, and rained blows down on her like raindrops, while uttering harsh and severe reproaches, "You slut! So, you've come here to do this shameless thing. You're unlucky to be caught by me today. I'll take your life!"  "If I am not allowed to do such a shameless act here, why are you allowed to do it? Does the magistrate have the right to burn down houses, but not the common people to light lamps? The needs of men and women are the same. If only men can satisfy their desires, then where do the women you mess with come from? You become violent when your wife is being pleasured by another man. Then the woman who is pleasuring you is also someone else's wife. Do you have a special license granting you special rights? Hmph, men steal wives and women steal husbands, this is a deserved retribution!"  It turned out that the female character he had grabbed was none other than his wife, a frequent visitor to × Villa. Today, seeing that her husband hadn't returned home at the usual time, she knew that he had gone to pursue other women. She figured she might as well go and pursue other men herself. Fate had it that the couple encountered each other. She had also run to Old Woman Wang's place. Old Woman Wang only knew Mr. Xie and did not recognize Mrs. Xie. Moreover, she had always used an alias when visiting, for fear of Old Woman Wang blabbing it out. So, she changed her name. Today, she didn't know that her husband was also here, so she had come boldly. Who knew that in the middle of their performance, she would suddenly be caught by her husband. Fortunately, she immediately saw that her husband was also coming out of a room with another woman standing beside him, so she knew that her husband was also doing the same kind of thing. Instantly, she became a hundred times bolder and immediately voiced the above rational protest.  "Ugh...ugh..." He was rendered speechless by his wife's words.

<p>City Government Transfers Case to Japanese Consulate for Negotiation</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Zhabei in this city, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately began investigating</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>household registrations. This has now been completed. However, in the area of the Mixed Court District, many Japanese residents refused to accept the household registration investigation when the Municipal Public Security Bureau went to investigate. As a result, the foreign household population statistics are still pending. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, considering this matter of great importance, specifically petitioned the City Government to negotiate with the Japanese Consul. The City Government, after receiving the petition, yesterday transferred a letter to Japanese Consul Murai for negotiation. The original letter is recorded below: Respectfully, the case is based on the report from the Municipal Public Security Bureau stating, according to the report from He Yiming, the district chief of the Fifth District, that the household registration inspector Jia Wenbin reported that about a hundred Japanese households in Lane 164 and Lane 236 of Baole'an Road, Yuqingli, and Yong'anli of North Sichuan Road in his jurisdiction jointly refused to fill out the forms. The proper procedure was requested. In addition to instructing the inspector to persuade them tactfully and continue the investigation, it is proper to report the situation and request examination and compliance. Previously, according to the report from the director of the Household Registration Section of this Bureau, a letter has been sent to the takeover committee for negotiation. Now, according to the aforementioned report, in addition to the instruction, it is proper to report the situation and request examination and approval to facilitate the case negotiation, which is in the public interest. Therefore, this letter is sent to request your review and instruct them to fill out the forms in accordance with the case for protection. We look forward to your reply.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Public Concession June Sanitary Overview <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department's June report states that the death rate for foreigners this month was 8.43 per thousand, and the death rate for Chinese was 9.98 per thousand. This is the lowest figure in twenty-five years. The number of deaths from infectious diseases in June compared to May is as follows: Cholera, in May, 25 cases, 1 death, percentage was 4; in June, 342 cases, 31 deaths, percentage was 9. Other infectious diseases, in May, 337 cases, 152 deaths, percentage was 45; in June, 348 cases, 149 deaths, percentage was 43. Since June 6, cholera has reached epidemic proportions, but the number of deaths is not high, perhaps because the nature of this cholera is milder or because of stronger resistance. The cause of cholera is quite complex and not easily understood without thorough research. Generally speaking, it can be divided into two types: short-term and chronic. "Short-term" is also a comparative term. As for the plague in Shanghai, it has developed more slowly this year compared to other locations. Regarding prevention work, it was inconvenient to administer injections in June due to heavy rainfall, but still 59,332 people were injected, totaling 87,270 people. Those injected by other organizations are not included in this number. In June, 600 wells were disinfected by the Health Department, but this measure also has drawbacks. If the amount of medicine used is insufficient, it can easily make drinkers careless, and because of the odor, it may even lead people to drink other water. However, drinking water is not the only source of cholera, so the method of prevention cannot be achieved overnight. Regarding this matter, cracking down on street vendors is an important issue. The crackdown on street vendors must be carried out in conjunction with the establishment of markets. We have been actively proceeding to the best of our ability. Two more will be built this year. Also, poor boat dwellers are a major problem that the Public Concession cannot solve alone. Dredging rivers, supplying clean water, and public education are all problems. Due to incomplete reporting, effective isolation cannot be carried out at the point of the outbreak. In addition, of other infectious diseases, smallpox has greatly decreased. There were 24 reported cases of scarlet fever. 65 Chinese people died of tuberculosis. There is nothing else noteworthy. The pathology laboratory was quite busy this month. There were 62 cases of plague treatment, four of whom came from other ports. The tuberculosis hospital and the venereal disease hospital were both busy. Regarding food, 105 samples of milk and cream were tested, and 87 were qualified. Four herds of cattle were inspected, and eight herds were tested for tuberculosis. The number of slaughters at the bureau-established slaughterhouse increased this month. 23 cattle and 13 pigs were discarded. Business at the vegetable markets was as usual, but due to a shortage of meat, butchers were noticeably diminished. Bakeries, ice cream shops, and ice factories were given special attention. 134 types of food were analyzed and tested for mold. A total of 180 cases were prosecuted for violating licensing regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Cholera Outbreak in the Southwestern Suburbs of This City <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>In the southwestern suburbs of this city, in the towns along the Caoxi River, Hongqiao, and Shanghai-Minhang Road, the weather has been extremely hot in recent days. Farmers working in the fields under the scorching sun have developed a plague. Patients experience simultaneous vomiting and diarrhea, abdominal pain like being twisted, and the infection spreads extremely quickly. Some die within moments without being treated. In the past two days, dozens of men and women have died from cholera. Local officials are now administering vaccinations to prevent the spread of the epidemic, and purchasing large quantities of Shada medicine water, distributing it to various villages. It is also known that Caohejing Town will establish a medical clinic on the 30th of this month, and has hired famous doctors from various departments to provide diagnoses separately.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Summer Epidemic Prevention Compilation <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Hongkou Public Epidemic Hospital, thanks to the contributions of Gu Shaoqing, Shen Shaoyu, Cai Xinjing, Cai Zhufang, and Han Pihao from the business community, specially requested Dr. Wang Boyuan and others to establish the Public Epidemic Hospital at the entrance of the small vegetable market on Dongyouheng Road in Hongkou, providing day and night diagnoses. All registration fees, medicine fees, and hospitalization fees are waived. Since its opening, more than a hundred workers from factories in the area and poor residents nearby have sought treatment daily. Recently, a patient named Dai Agen, who was suffering from an epidemic and unconscious for about an hour, was treated by Dr. Wang of the hospital and recovered, it is said.</p>
<p>The Fifth District of the County Organizes Injections and Medical Treatment. Xing Zhigang, the district chief of the Fifth District of Shanghai County, in view of the recent hot weather and the prevalence of epidemics, has hired Western doctors to provide free vaccinations at the major intersections of the towns of Tangkou and Tiqiao under his jurisdiction. Furthermore, considering that farmers working in the fields are exposed to the scorching sun and suffer from heatstroke and various seasonal illnesses, and that the poor and sick are unable to seek medical treatment, he has specially invited renowned doctors from various departments, including Hu Youxin, Wang Sicheng, and the female physician Zhang Youfang, to establish a summer medical clinic in Chenhangji, providing free consultations and medication. From July 25th to September 30th, regular diagnoses will be provided. It is said that there are more than two hundred patients every day, which is very crowded, and the local people have benefited greatly.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Recent Situation of Du's Epidemic Hospital <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng, in order to relieve the epidemic and benefit the poor, has taken on the responsibility of establishing five epidemic hospitals this year. The hospital affairs of each hospital are assisted by Dr. Pang Jingzhou. At this time of cholera prevalence, the clinics of each hospital are extremely busy. It is estimated that the Gaoqiao Jiqun Hospital has an average of more than 200 outpatient visits per day, the Lannidu Hospital has more than 100 visits per day, and the Yangjing Hospital also has nearly 100 visits per day. During the epidemic period, the Shanghai North Xizang Road Emergency Epidemic Hospital had more than 300 visits per day, including internal medicine and surgical outpatient visits. Recently, Mr. Du, in view of the severe epidemic in various villages in Pudong, specially established an epidemic hospital in Gaohang Township, which is currently being prepared and will be established soon. The area is densely populated with inadequate sanitation facilities, and many people are suffering from the epidemic. It is expected that there will be more than 100 visits per day. If calculated in this way, the five hospitals will treat 300,000 patients annually, all completely free of charge, benefiting the sick to a great extent.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Recent News from Yangjing Town Epidemic Hospital <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yangjing Town in Pudong is densely populated and has many factories. Every summer, epidemic prevention is established to benefit the poor and sick. This year, local gentry, in view of the widespread epidemic after the war, expanded the Yangjing Epidemic Hospital in Baorentang on Baoren Road. They specially hired Dr. Sun Naikang, a top student of the famous Shanghai doctor Pang Jingzhou, as the medical director, and also hired Dr. Feng Guliang, nurses Wu San, Tang Ruirong, pharmacist Huang Zhenxin, and general affairs Huang Shengji to assist. This year, all the equipment in the hospital is more complete than in previous years, including a consultation room, a physiological saline injection room, a dispensing room, a waiting room, a morgue, and multiple wards specifically for admitting epidemic patients day and night, providing diagnoses and medicine free of charge, specializing in internal and external medicine and providing free epidemic prevention injections. It is reported that since the hospital opened on the 5th of this month, it has been less than two weeks, and more than 1,500 patients have been treated, with more than 20 cases of true cholera, all of whom have been cured and discharged. The number of people seeking treatment at the hospital every day is crowded and overwhelming.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Recent News from the Second Red Cross Epidemic Hospital <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Second Epidemic Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society last month, the number of patients has exceeded 6,000. The original 150 beds have now been increased by 40 due to the increase in inpatients and the lack of space. It is reported that yesterday more than 40 patients needed saline injections. The severity of the epidemic can be imagined. However, it is also because the hospital is located in a suitable location at Zhangjiabang, north of the Racecourse, and the staff are all top choices, so people are happy to seek treatment with the hope of recovery. The telephone number is 31271, and an ambulance is available to pick up patients immediately upon receiving a call, free of charge.</p>
