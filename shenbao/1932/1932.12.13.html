<p>美國負問題前途重大責任</p>

<p>喬治復將日本在滿洲之行動、與英國在埃及之行爲、兩相比較、並聲明彼在靑年之時、曾追附約翰勃　德之後、對於英國政府之政策、加以攻擊、彼今已有許多理由、可以引誘日本之安然繼續施行其現在之政策云、致於此種理由、是否穏健、則至可疑問、而喬治個人之意見、深　倘此種理由果然穏健者、則歐洲前次之大戰、實屬毫無意味、則是目前之吾人、仍在開倒車、回復戰前之路徑、而造成國際間無政府狀態、與帝國主義之進攻是也、</p>

<h3 id="c24">砲擊山海關與新軍縮案晦 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>㈠日本在國聯特别大會中。旣爲主持公理之各國所不容。雖有一二國代表爲其所蒙蔽。然而仍不能掩蔽其以武力侵略之事實。不過欲把持其所謂「旣成事實」起見。乃不能不更造作新的假事實。以爲舊時僞造事實之烟冪。</p>
<p>第一借新問題之發生。轉移國際間對舊問題之注視。蓋（滿洲（傀儡）國）者。雖三歳小兒亦審知其爲日本軍閥所僞造。借以緩和國際間之反對者也。在理固難許其獨占東北三省。在勢更不容其支配遠東市塲。日閥亦知其然也。乃多方求得英國諒解。以開放「滿洲」之門户爲條件。以更進一步之武力擾亂作威脅。</p>
<p>第二東北三省陷落以後。除華軍無抵抗退出而外。所謂舊時弊政之改革。所謂秩序之維持。所謂外國僑民生命財產之確保：：：無一不爲虚僞之飾詞。日官之貪墨。且駕其軍閥而上之。秩序也者。惟有混亂而已。英國僑民且常被擄。其他更成俎上之肉矣。彼欲掩蓋其醜惡。須造作更緊張之現象。以維繫其傀儡之存在。</p>
<p>於是本月八日之夜。山海關復又砲聲震天矣。熱邊又增加日軍一大隊矣。無論其爲虚聲抑爲更進一步之武力擾亂。而國際公約之無力。日本軍閥之横暴。則已爲世界所共知。我國能始終忍讓任人宰割。而不亟起敵拼死命相「角力」耶</p>
<p>㈡彼日本者對華雖採取積極的攻勢。而對列則不能不戴上仁義道德之面具。於軍縮尤表示贊同。然其所提之軍縮新案則何如。據日内瓦五日電稱。日本松平恒雄佐藤春夫兩表所提軍縮新案内容如下。</p>
<p>「第一部（一設恊定）英美爲十一。日本爲八。其標準在區别防禦與攻擊之性能廢乘航空母艦。主力艦則由三萬五千噸减低至二萬五千噸。主砲口徑由十六英时減至十四英時大洋艦由一萬噸减至八千噸。潛水艦由二千噸減至一千八百噸」在日本近海距離。尤以保持潛水艦爲最有利。「世界五大海軍國。皆當肯定的縮減其相對性質之主力艦及巡洋艦各國就其地理的位置與特殊的關係。僅决定總噸數之最大限制。其實際之軍力。以現實之保有量爲標準。第二部（特别恊定）以世界各國之直接利害關係爲基礎。而以地方爲區别（如太平洋組。大西洋組。歐洲組。南美組。）以第一部之恊定爲基礎。於可能範圍内。縮小各國現時所保持之艦艇數量。</p>
<p>㈢僅以表面觀察。日本此種提案。縱非根本縮小軍備。而海軍就質量的縮減似甚确實真有謀人類幸福。圖世界和平之感。然細審其内容。　之以山海關之被轟繫。熱河之被侵襲。東北人民之被殘殺。則所謂和平面具。已破毁無餘矣。</p>
<p>所謂限制攻擊的性能者。十六砲與十四时砲有以異乎。一萬噸與八千噸。有以異乎。而潛水艦在歐戰期中非挑動美國參加之唯一武器耶。矧日本所最注目者。第一爲遠東市塲之獨占。第一爲菲列濱及關島之軍港。第三爲太平洋上之制海權。設使主力艦縮小。航空母艦　棄。則美國對太平洋西岸之市塲。萬難保持。菲列濱及關島之海軍根據地。將淪於敵手太平洋海上　覇。除加利福尼亞沿岸而外。恐再不許美國同鼎。而限制攻勢的性能者。特限制美國之攻勢性能。限制其不得飛越太平洋而已耳。</p>
<p>日本則乘此時機。利用其短小精悍之海軍組織。非特可以雄飛東海。且可以侵入我國腹地。借保僑之名實行其獨占的市塲支配也。所尤恐者軍縮面具如果作成。則山海關之砲聲將及於　河以西。而蹂躝遼東之鐵騎。恐將踏遍熱河而次及幽燕。列國容成迷於甘言。震於現勢而我國則身當其衝。備嘗其苦。能不亟起與敵作殊死之奪鬥耶。</p>

<p>川戰之起原　成都之特殊狀况</p>
<p>巷戰之經過　戰後之人間地獄</p>
<p>此次别川戰、好像是人身上的一個瘡、已銰</p>
<p>經積了五六年、是不能不潰爛才潰爛的、川省地面大山多、兼交通不便所以容易產生封建軍閥、自從楊森敗後、留下四個大頭子、一個在重慶、俗稱渝劉、（即劉湘）二十一軍軍長、三個在城都、一是二十四軍軍長劉文輝、同時是省政府主席·俗稱省劉、一是二十八軍軍長鄧鍚侯、一是二十九軍軍長田頌堯、合稱鄧田劉三軍長、</p>
<p>就全部言、二劉勢力最大、一則據守重慶、奄有川東二十餘縣、其兵力及於湖北沙市、稅收極爲旺盛、一則占據成都、屬縣有全川之半、（七十餘縣）且富庶之區、如永川内江資中資陽、：均在其内、稅收亦不惡、前者（劉湘）挂肯四川善後督辦的銜頭、抱負自是非凡、大有統一川局作西南盟主之槪、所以厲兵𥞊馬不遺餘力、�</p>
<p>現在居然川江有他的兵艦、渝縣有他的飛機塲、一身而兼海陸空軍司令、氣熖更炙物可熱、對於省劉、未免有許多呌他過２不去的地方、最顯著的、莫過於扣留他在下游購買的一切軍用品、久而久之、就連撥藥用品也同樣扣留、省劉爲此曾不惜屈尊親到重慶交涉、渝劉不但不允放還、並且百般延宕、將他軟禁了一個多月、省劉回到城都发以後、其種憤悶之氣、不問可知、而渝劉自覺西南盟主之地位非商議所能辦到、也就積極備戰了、　兼以後有後台、内有内應、（田頌堯）其動志益堅、　十月初就開始了他的軍事行動了、</p>
<p>省劉自知來勢不佳、於是唱倸定同學合作之説、同時對於鄧田畏示寛大、劃出三縣與鄧、三縣於田、然而田與劉湘早有默契、站在一條戰綫、（聯軍）十　月六號、田軍先在成都向省劉開槍了、劉初絶不還擊、然終未回田軍長之心、乘聯軍前綫節節勝利、省劉節節退讓、以爲加以脅迫、不難使省劉屈服、整軍退出城外、坐收漁人之利、於是屢屢釁、那知道省劉堅　抱城存與存城亡與亡之决心、絲毫不爲所動、而成都之巷戰、遂不可避免、於十一月十五下午一點半的時光就揭幕了、</p>
<p>成都的特别狀况、不但全國没有、就連世界也没有、</p>
<p>成都城周圍、大約二十八里的光景、城牆大部尚稱完整、以歷史言主、分本城與少城、本城就是成都、少城原是滿城、本城占東面約全部三分之二、東門内（東大街春煕路）　带、爲工商業所在、馬路寛廣、夜間電炬照耀、行人擁擠、北平西四牌樓、不及其二三、少城彷佛瀋陽的商埠地、爲一般逹官貴人住所所在、没什麽工商業這是没什麽特殊的、</p>
<p>其特殊的地方、在行政組織上、稍露端倪、丨一個城是兩縣的屬地、東南兩部是華陽的屬地、有華陽縣政府、西北兩部是成都縣政府的屬地、有成都縣政府、兩縣政府之上、還有一個市政府、市政府之上還有一個省政府、省政府還有三個軍政府、（三軍部）三個軍政府、可説是太上政府了、</p>
<p>在治安上、其特别已比較明白、丨各街有各街的圑務公所、由各街住户出錢、養幾個烟容滿面老弱不堪的兵士、保持街上的治安、其上又有市政府的警察、警察之上、又有省城軍警聯合辦事處的軍警、更上有各軍軍部直接所派的士兵、這士兵也可説是太上的士兵、</p>
<p>最特别的是在軍事防區、丨一個城分三個防區、就大體來講蚈在戰前、二十四軍占南門内一带及東門内一带、二十八軍占北門内一带及西門内一带、餘爲二十九軍的防區、就再詳細的一看、二十四軍防區之内、或還有二十九軍的防地、錯綜複雜、難於究詰、各軍的防區、綫絶對彷彿獨立國家、内邊的行政人員、如縣政府人員由軍部委任、聽軍部的指揮、内邊的稅收、由軍部徵收、内邊的治安、由軍部主管、什麽警士什麽軍警聯合辦事處的軍士、都不過聾子的耳朶、警士可算是全國最可憐的了、脚上襪子都没有、身穿淡黄的軍衣、手拿一根哭喪棒、連街上都不敢站、都偷偷的躱在舗面裹、有殺人赿貨的事發生、丨並且時常發生的丨凶手由這個軍區跑到那個軍區、什麽事都没有了、甚而白畫殺人赿貨、均無人過問、人民真是軍閥的芻狗、生命財產一點保障都没有、</p>
<p>在這樣局勢之下、省劉自然是坐臥不安、而鄧田年來亦覺得被迫、有不能久安之勢、所以戰是不能避免的、</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>成都巷戰、自十一月有十五日下午起、至二十四日早晨止、最激烈的是頭兩天、一氣打二十四個小時、未曾停息片刻、大砲機關槍手溜彈同時並用、隆隆貫耳、想到失地、想到國聯的代表、不禁令人淚下、兩軍作戰的焦點、起初共有兩處、㈠爲二十四軍軍部、㈡爲皇城、後來又加入東門外的兵工廠、</p>
<p>二十四軍軍部丨即從前的將軍府、是少城與本城交界的所在、其北面不遠、就是二十九軍的防區、其師長曾南夫的公館在奎星樓街、距離軍部甚近、此處前後左右火線最密、大街小巷、都滿堆着石板彷彿一道的城墻、</p>
<p>皇城丨俗傅　是劉後主的遺城、清末尚稱完好、民國二年經了一月多的轟炸、現在殘留的僅不過一個南門、一個北門、和一大的土堆、號稱煤山、從南門到北門都是學校、南門内兩旁是兩個中學、中間是四川大學文學院·敎育學院、後頭是附屬小學·民新中學·及藝專男生部、</p>
<p>皇城地勢甚高、站在煤山或城門上、可以俯瞰全城、因之遂爲軍事上必爭之地、兵工廠丨在東門外、爲二十九軍生命的源泉、據云通常有二千餘人在内做工、槍械子彈、都可製造、</p>
<p>其次要的地方、爲距皇城不遠的陜西街、此處爲劉公館所在、</p>
<p>除了頭兩天外、其餘大都是白天休息、夜裹開火、記者住南門内南校塲法學院、始終甚安全</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>二十四日據出的佈告、二十九軍接受鄧錫侯的調停、允許撤兵出城、並云秩序現已恢復、但到處僞難通過、直至昨日（廿五日）午後、方得到處周遊、二十四軍軍部未受大損失、可憐的是四周的民房、皇城四川大學及前面兩個中學、都没什麽損失、毁壤得最慘的、是後邊的附屬小學民新中學及藝專、大部都被燒了、未被燒的、都到處是槍洞洞殘垣破壁、好不令人傷心、再後丨出門丨御西邊街更打得悽慘、這條街是小生意小買賣的拉車的所在、平日已經苦不堪言、現在窠巢穿天、什物消失、更何以爲生、有的是孩子　啼飢號寒、母親清涙度滾滾、仰天興嗟、有的是三寸桐棺横於門前、妻子椎心泣血、不知所云、有的是道士誦經響聲叮噹、送此幽魂、有的母死父在、孤兒一羣、有的繞室迴環、涕泗滂沱、有的兩目直瞪、彷彿南柯夢醒、加添上猶在露天臥食鴉片的烟鬼、加添上糞氣塞鼻的毛厠、十八層地獄、恐怕也不過如此、</p>
<p>然尤有更傷心者在也丨這是在御西邊街的東頭、一個婦人哭得鼻涕一把、眼淚一把、囗沬圑、哭得死去活來、她的丈夫早去世了、她的惟一指望、是她六歲的爱兒、丨被槍打死了、她千辛萬苦養的一隻猪、也被軍隊宰吃了、現在四壁索然、：這是在東御河北街、（貼着皇城）一百九十六號家裹、一座很漂亮的洋房裹、一共停了六囗棺材、有老嫗抱頭痛哭、從她哭聲中聽到有一個　是好的丈夫、兩個是她的男兒、兩個是她的女兒、：：：天地爲之悽愴、寃魂誰去報復：：：</p>
<p>但：：奇怪、實在也没什麽可奇、聽説田劉兩軍長又在進行合作了、在巷戰的期間、這合作的呼聲、也曾發現了兩次、並且兩軍長也曾過頭、：：</p>
<p>又聽説田頌堯仍與渝劉相聯、現在暫時退出城外、待聯軍逼近成都、再捲土重來、：：：</p>
<p>究竟到那步田地、我們不知道、就連當局也不知道、我們所可知道的、當局也自己　明白的、是「一切以個人地位爲轉移、」</p>
<p>滿街上貼着打倒田頌堯、因爲他㈠違反民意、㈡破壤和平、㈢挑動川戰、㈣勾結劉湘等等標語、墨汁未乾、保護二十九軍軍官住宅的佈告、又煌煌的披露了、</p>
<p>二十八軍將領與二十九軍將領通電、勸告二十四軍將領棄暗投明、説「不要爲個人的走狗、要爲國家的軍隊、」是多麽堅　决啊、多麽激昂啊、乃不轉眼間二十八軍將領又高唱中立了、鄧軍長又本悲天憫人之旨奔走和平了、：：：（十一月二十六日於成都）</p>

<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>「喂喂‘不要跑，小癦三，捉賊！」一個很大的發音在大發的背後喊，正在打算着籃裏的東西的三得，比大發更嚇，看清楚了才知道不是喊着自家，自家的手還没有伸進籃子　。</p>
<p>在大發近傍覧茄子毛荳的男人站起了，謗遇了面　兩個大籃子，向前面追去。</p>
<p>「捉這個小賊，我一轉頭，就偷了三個大茄茄</p>
<p>子！······喂，豆腐的老三，謝謝你替擔子留一留心吧！</p>
<p>聴到的人都注意這件新的熱閙了。</p>
<p>在前面跑着的一個孩子，一脚踏着了什麽東西，險些兒滑下去，可是他還没命的跑，這路上的人又多，越想跑快，就越跑悄快。至底給一個胖胖的提着長籃子的男人，像闊人家裹廚司模樣的，一把抓住了。那孩子瘦得像柴乾，經不起那有力的一抓，就歪歪斜斜的退了好多路，蹲在地上了，可是手　大茄子仍舊捧得緊緊的没有放手。剛從地上爬起，那個賣茄子的已經走至跟前。</p>
<p>「你怎麽偷老子的東西，一天生意也赚不了多少錢，給你偷三個還得了嗎？」</p>
<p>孩子是滿脸兇横的神氣。見到賣茄子的過來搶他手裏的東西·又瘋一般地想逃跑了，可是他逃不了，他就説··</p>
<p>「這三個就給我吃吧，我不知道多少時候没有得吃了，你就做一回好事罷。」</p>
<p>「你要吃，我也要吃啦，都像你這樣子來偷，我也吃不成飯了。你要吃，跟你老子要去才對，怎麽這樣小的年紀就會動手偷！」</p>
<p>「那麽你還有飯吃的時候，就給我吃一點吧！我老子是餓死了的，媽做縫碎的又養不活兩個人，我没有地方可以去要飯吃啦。」</p>
<p>賣茄子的聴了就呆着不動。孩子像飢餓野獸那樣的，又想衝過了人　逃去。</p>
<p>「這小王八羔子，聽他這些鬼話，這麽點年紀就會偷東西，不把他敎訓，再長大點還了得」</p>
<p>孩子聽了人　中這個話生氣了，他把一個茄子描準了那個人丢去，説··</p>
<p>「又不是偷你的，干你什麽事！不偷要餓死，你管得了我！」</p>
<p>賣茄子的看見孩子丢了他的茄子，也真的生氣了。</p>
<p>「小賊，那麽你偷人家的東西倒是應該的？」</p>
<p>人羣中那個給茄子撃痛痛了的人，狠狠的走前兩步，跟賣茄子的一起伸了拳頭，拳頭都落在那　孩子的身上。</p>
<p>「啊呀，」大發才一個疏忽，再一看時那孩子的嘴邊已經有着血了。</p>
<p>見了血好像大家全爽快，敎訓也完了，就把那孩子推在一邊，走不到三步路，孩子又倒了下去。賣茄子的拾起三個茄子，咕嚕着回到自家的籃子跟前去了。雖然還吃了一點虧，！</p>
<p>這麽一來少做幾個生意，可是心裹總覺得痛快了。</p>
<p>「大發，走啦，老站着幹什麽？」</p>
<p>大發一回頭，看見三得手裏捧了幾個挺大的大蒜，還有小小的幾根蘿　。奇怪得正要問大發，忽地就懂得了一切。</p>
<p>「你不怕給人家打嗎！走到一條小弄裹，大發急急的咬着蘿　問。</p>
<p>「我比孩子要高明，還得謝謝他，因爲人家要緊瞧熱閙，我才得下手的。我在一個買了好多大魚大肉的籃子裹拿的，拿了生的魚肉反不中吃，就跟他客氣點兒啦」</p>
<p>三得臉上泛起一一絲微笑。</p>

<h3 id="c149">戀愛是無條件的嗎？ <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 龺紀女士</p>
<p>無條件的愛，已經成爲過去的高調··至於現在，則大數人已承認愛不是無條件的了。自然，我也是大多數中的一個。</p>
<p>愛之具有條件，雖已被人公認，但是其條件則因人而不同··其實那些高唱無條件的愛的人，她們或他們的愛的原質中、就無形中包含有條件在，不過他們或她們自己不覺得，或者不肯説出來罷了。</p>
<p>究竟什麽是愛的條件呢？普通常常以爲就是金錢，勢力及美色、丨這也難怪人家這樣誤會，因爲現在很多戀愛者便常常以此爲條件。丨其實除此以外，條件還多着呢，譬如高深的學問，高尚的道德，共同的思想，向上的志願，剛强的毅力，特殊的才能，强壯的身體··相當的年齡，温和的性情······等等都是，算來算去，總不外乎物質的與精神的或外表的與内在的爾種範圍。一個人可以有一個條件或幾個條件以爲她或他選擇愛人的標準。</p>
<p>我敢武斷的説，有條件的愛並不玷汚愛的神聖。要判斷神聖的愛是否爲條件所玷汚，須先看講愛的人的條件是甚麽。換句話説，只有那些以金錢，勢力及美色爲條件的人才是卑鄙，下流；而以學問、性情、身體、思想、志氣、才能等爲條件的人却是正當、合理、高尚前者的愛可以説是買賣式的、嫖客與妓女式的，而後者的愛却不然、那是互愛，那是真正純潔的愛。前者根本講不上是愛、簡直是無聊的衝動，易於發生危險、丨不是女的被棄，就是她另有所歡，或琵琶别抱丨而後者則不然，他們的愛是理智化的·有深厚的根基·所以也就經久不變。</p>
<p>我覺得現在稍息有點志氣，想做個獨立者的女子，常常以婚姻爲一個討厭的問題，結婚吧，前途就會埋葬在家庭生活中，不結婚吧·免不了受追求的麻煩和因向自己求婚不遂的譭謗。於是結婚與否，二者之間，必擇其一。究竟何者爲善？我以爲不結婚便罷，要結婚須得謹愼，愛應該理智化，即是定出合理的純潔的條件來以擇自己的對象，萬不可受金錢或小白臉的引誘，由這樣的愛而結合的婚姻關係，不但不會使自己的志氣消沉下去，而且還可以彼此鼓勵着去幹彼此應幹的事。因此我主張愛是要有條件的。</p>
<p>「愛是有條件的嗎？」這是一個實際問題，也是一個有趣的問題。現在這問題重新爲韋紀女士所提出，被愛火燃燒着的「青年男子」及「妙齡女郎」們，請對於係們切身的問題加以仔細的考慮，並請公開你們的卓見。編者</p>

<h3 id="c151">賣藝 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 濤</p>
<p>在前日的新聞報和上海晨報上，在昨日的本報上，陶知行先生登載有一則賣藝的啓事，賣的是文，字，和講。</p>
<p>他的啓事中有四句詩··「風高誰放李逵火？武訓討飯也不易！自殺不成怕坐牢，從來不演折腰戲。」在這四句詩中，不僅是畫出了這畸形社會的一個輪廓，而且這裏面還活躍着陶先生的全部人格。放火旣不願，討飯又不易，而自殺則又是犯罪的勾當，做一個現社會的人直是何等的艱難呵！</p>
<p>陶先生是一個有主張的敎育家，「敎，學，做，」是他的口號，凡是參觀過曉莊師範以及讀過曾在本報發表過的古廟敲鐘錄的人，對於這句話，我想大槪是都不會懹疑的。所以陶先生的文和講，都是經騐的積纍，充滿了「力」，和「能」。至於他的字，也挾有一股沉着的力。關於這些，陶先生自己雖説並没有和賣瓜人一樣高呌「我的瓜是多麽甜，」但，我們却可以證明陶先生的瓜，確實是甜的！</p>
<p>本來，在我國，每個人都懂得一點生意經，眼前的一切，就無不是「買賣勾當，」買賣位置，買賣人情，買賣人命，都成爲正當的買賣，但，在南京夫子廟賣藝的女生，却被認爲有關校譽而開除學籍，從這點我們可以想見惟有藝的買賣不容易做。正因爲藝不易賣，所以「人情」「人命」才易賣，我們不希望這現象再延長下去，所以陶先生肯「硬着頭皮試一試，」我」</p>
<p>們是極表贊同。</p>
<p>假如社會是識貨的話，我想，陶先生不等到「擇吉開張，」一定會「生意興隆！」</p>
<h3 id="c152">水力發電 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊</p>
<p>人們很早便知道應用大自然的水力促成人人類的進步，如水力春米水力旋磨等。至近百年來，又發明了電氣原理，知道利用電磁氣，以機械力來發生電力；其後更能以深山的溪流發電。於是在這五六十年中，人類努力開發水流，到現在乃爲水力發電的全盛時期。</p>
<p>但水力發電的工程是怎樣的呢？先在河流中築設堰堤，使上流成爲一大貯水池，若是利用湖水，當然不必如此。其次在河流的直角方位設一流水口，從流水中取出泥砂或其他一切雜物，自流水口陸續延着水路而導入水槽。所謂水槽是在流水口的傾斜而上裝着壓水管而使水流猛烈的下降。壓水管的下端裝設水車，　水力之衝擊而旋轉。再將水車直接着發電機，發生電力。然後電力通過變壓器加以昇壓，以電線送至變電所。最後在變電所中降低電壓，而傳送到用户家裏。</p>
<p>經濟的水力發電所，當然是大規模的能夠產生多量的電力，但是技術進步，减少運轉費用，　末小型的發電所也很經濟。但是小型發電所需要許多職工、所以現在不使用職工的自動發電所甚爲發達。最近這一方面技術上有着顯着的進步。</p>
<p>自動水力發電所分爲二種。一爲　重要發電所内電力不足的時候，或因必要而將主要發電所的開關閉塞的時候，於是自動發電所的電動機開始旋轉而輸送相當的電力。另一種爲純自動式，如自動發電所的貯水池的水面，完全停止在某一定高度，而其浮標却仍上升，於是自動的關閉制禦回路機關而發電所開始旋轉。如水而下落便自動的停止、而等待所需要的水面恢復。</p>
<h3 id="c153">雲南的玀（二） <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 王俞</p>
<p>滴水的時候到了，許多婦女和老頭子們便換上清潔的衣服，用金瓶或銀瓶或其他的瓶或壺斟滿了一瓶清水，带往缅寺。於是大佛爺便率領着他們，一而念經，一面把瓶裏的清水一滴一滴的滴在每個偶像的　面，聽説這是對偶像表示敬意的意思。如果他們尊敬你，他們也也把清水　到你身上來的。</p>
<p>缅寺裡整理得異常清潔，所以居住在寺裏的人們常常是赤足的。而那供奉偶像的地方，是無論什麽人都不許穿著鞋子踼進未的，如果違犯了，就要受到　厲的責罰。</p>
<p>（三）他們的裝束因爲與漢人雜居的緣故和漢人一樣。但在女人的一方面，却還表現着特殊的情調。</p>
<p>她們不像那些鄉下姑娘一般纒着足兒，也不像都市小姐一般束着胸兒，總之，　的體格是很健康的。她們雖然蓄着一頭很長的頭髮，可是並不把牠披在肩上。她們穿的是很短的白上衣和很長的黑裙。她們的裙，就是一整幅五尺見長，三尺見寛的布。她們的腰部，有一根長長的带子束在裙端，而且束很緊，因爲他們是以細腰爲美的。頭上，她們像印度人一般用頭巾包着，可是她們的頭巾很長，包在頭上，就好像戴着一頂草帽似的，熱烈的日光可以晒不着他們那白而嫩的臉。</p>
<p>從前，無論男或女，他們都喜歡把自己的牙齒染成漆一般的黑，以爲這　美觀。女人們還要在耳　上掛上一對環。但現在，這樣的裝飾已經不能在玀　萃中愽得榮　了，幾乎絶跡了。</p>
<p>她們旣不喜歡擦粉，也不喜歡塗胭脂。</p>
<p>（四）他們的禮儀説起他們的禮儀來，可真有味。記得我在小學代，曾跟我的祖父到一個玀　的家裡去作客遇。入席的時候，那位老主人首先在左邊坐下，然後請我的祖父坐在右邊。當時我的祖父也喜歡講究這些盧爲的禮儀，於是他自己爭先的跑到右邊去，而把左邊的席位讓與那位老主人。我當時看見這種情形，有點英明其妙，回家以後我把這事告訴我的父親，他才解釋給我聽，説玀　是以右邊爲大左邊爲小的，正和我們漢人以左爲大以右爲小的習慣相反。</p>
<p>當我們家裡來了客人的時候，我們不是要預備一些好的菜飯並有要陪着客人一塊兒吃喝嗎？可是玀　的禮儀却不是這樣的。玀　如果把你當作貴客看待，他們便擺着一桌子菜飯讓你一個人享用。在我們看來，這簡直含有一逐客一的意思，而在他們呢，却是特别　待的意思。</p>
<p>（五）他們的娛樂每年在清明節以前的第十天，他們有一種屬於宗敎形式的娛樂，呌做「採花」，或者呌做「採大花」。在這個時候，他們停止一切的工作，換上新衣，大家都擺出一付愉快的面孔來，彷彿我們對於新年或西洋人對於聖誔節一樣。</p>
<p>他們開始這種娛樂是在清明前十數日的時候，然而只有在清明以前的第十天　玩得最閙熱，所以他們把那天呌做「大採」，以前的　天都呌做「小採」。</p>
<p>小採的時候，先由缅寺裏的小和尚在缅寺的大門口打着鼓，擂着　，敲着　，拍着　台上常用的鉸子，這樣的依着單　的拍子奏了半天，表示「採花」的玩意見已經開始了。從這時起，每天下午便有許多男女自由的　合到缅寺　來，每人手裡握着一把家花或野花，還有一雙碗丨或是　碗，或是磁碗，或是土碗，有時還可以看見金製的碗丨這雙碗是　備往清流中　「拿沙」的時候　的。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>耀星説着，裝出女性走路的樣子來給海泉看，同時做了一個鬼臉。於是他倆在這陰鬰的空敎室裹閧笑了一陣。</p>
<p>打掃敎室的老雜差拿着條帚走進來了。他倆便從敎室裏怱怱的走出來。</p>
<p>唐耀星今天在霞飛路華龍路口的一家俄菜館裏請了海泉吃了一餐夜飯，也和他談了不少文壇的近狀。歸納他的意思是，中國的文藝界實在是太壤了，亂七八糟的。只要拿定一個主張·積極地幹下去，一定可以制覇文壇。以前文藝界之糟，就是糟在没有一派有主張的文藝。</p>
<p>但是海泉聽見心裏有點不舒服，忍耐不住了，便反駁了他一下。</p>
<p>「周大哥，金二哥，馬三哥，他們辦的火星文藝月刋不是有主張的文藝刋物麽？」</p>
<p>「那算得什麽東西！第一句是兩行眼淚，第二句是一股熱血。簡直是胡説覇道！一點系統的理諭也沒有。」</p>
<p>給耀星一反駁，海泉一時又沒有話可回答了。</p>
<p>周德，金梅山，馬至愚三個人，是近來才新成立的火星文藝會的創辦人。他們標榜着社會主義文藝的招牌，新出了一種火星文藝月刋。他們正大興高彩烈，像新開張的小雜貨店，請了一班西洋樂隊，在他們的社樓上，啼啼打打，叮叮噹噹的吹奏起來了。</p>
<p>海泉便想，唐耀星這個人的主張未免太强了一點。他的説話，縱令不錯，但是那種偏着頸項説話的神氣，實在會引起對手方的反感。有理的主張也要變爲無理的主張了。</p>
<p>臨别時，唐耀星再叮囑他改天介紹他去會會陳華民先生·羹要他守秘密。</p>
<p>海泉搭了電車回到曾敎授寓門首來時，聽見屋子裏很熱閙的，像有許多人在談話。他覺得有點奇怪，忙停了脚步，偷了一下。但是一句話也不懂·原來裏面的人們所説的是東洋話。他想有客在前面客堂裏，不便在那裏經過，忙　到後門首來，敲門，娘姨便開了門。他剛踏進來，就聽見　子夫人也趕出來·立在樓梯下的門邊。</p>
<p>「林先生回來了？吃過晚飯沒有？」</p>
<p>「吃過了。」</p>
<p>他答應着，便打算上樓。但好奇心呌他偷望了一上前頭的客廳裏。他看見」個東洋男人，兩個東洋女子，男的像有些歲數了，至少在四十以上。</p>
<p>「他們是新從日本鄉裏的，讓我招待他們一下。真對不住了，林先生。」</p>
<p>鶴子夫人隻手扶着樓梯的扶欄，向着他嫣然地笑了一下。她那種笑容，有些像向他乞憐的神氣。海泉還不明白她爲什麽要向他表示那樣的態度。他只點了點頭·一直走上樓上去了。</p>
<p>當唐耀星要他加入他們的文藝圑體時，他本來有七分願意的。不過不便馬上滿口答應，不能不謙遜了一下。想到今後自己寫的文章有發表的機會了，不禁又高興起来。</p>

<h3 id="c182">濟南妖匪案 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>近日社會上發生了一件比較值得注意的事，那便是濟南破獲妖匪一案，八日濟南通訊云，</p>
<p>昨早七時濟南破獲妖匪案，當將人犯宋王氏樂川傅賓祺等，連同抄出之伴朝鸞駕全副，及神樓，黄綾神年，錦衣冠，旗幟等物，解送到局，現將人犯暫押拘留所，最可注意者，爲李樂川所供，宣統主迭派人來接洽，云日本可供給槍砲，助奈成事，又云練習符咒甚多，槍砲可以不入云，聞李之詭謀，已醖釀多年，某也宰相，某也將軍</p>
<p>我們看了這則新聞，覺得確有探討的必要，</p>
<p>第一可説由日本主使，至少的話，也可説是日蛤所組織的僞滿洲國所主使，祇看李樂川口供，「宣統派人來説，日本可供給槍砲」，即可知其大槪，就事實言，更足證明有日本陰謀的可能，遠點説，十七年濟南慘案，被日兵佔擾數月，城内不免撒下許多暴目的陰謀種子，經過幾年的醖釀，遂成今日的雛形組織，近點説，自九一八禍變後，國内已有不少漢奸暗中受日方指揮，希圖活動，漢口曾破獲過一起漢奸的大活動，就如萬方雜處的上海，恐亦不免有兩種組織的存在，况濟南係北方重鎭，與平津等處，均極有地理及政治上的關係，所以説是暴日的陰謀，實具有可告靠性。</p>
<p>第二，北方本爲吾國文化發祥地，但近今以還，却成了封建餘孽的喘息所，舊勢力的匯合場，昔曾引起八國聯軍的拳匪之亂，近有唸經拜佛種種鬼組織的活躍，此次之妖匪組織，適與拳匪如出一轍，且連年以來，天災人禍，交相煎逼，韓劉之大火併，更閙得田廬成墟，鷄犬不寗，以此一般平民，或受舊小説之迷醉，或中了一貫的傳統，舊思想的遺毒，於是乃形成祈神求福以及從事創造「真命天子」的幻想，這也可以説得過去。</p>
<p>總之這妖匪組織之出現，實係惡劣的現社會所造成，所以要肅清這種匪孽，非單單清匪所能了事，必定先要將内亂平靖起來，政治清明起来，外患抵抗起來，此種妖孽自無由而生，否則「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生，」這樣的把戲正方興未艾呢。</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3 id="c183">酒 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 盛水根</p>
<p>酒除了我們飮用以外，有地（例如上海）還把酒當做烹調的東西。各國關於酒的名稱，可算多極了。但是總不外澱粉變成的洒精。取富含澱粉的穀物蒸�</p>
<p>熟，加麯菌，那末澱粉變成糖，再加釀母，於是糖變成爲酒精。這時的化學反應如後··</p>
<p>Ｂ１２Ｈ２２Ｏ１１＝Ｈ２０＋４Ｃ２Ｈ６ＯＨ４ＢＯ２麥芽糖　水酒精　二氧化炭氣做洒的方法　拿糯米浸入水中，再用水漂清，倒入鍋内，蒸熱以後；拿飯倒了出來，攤放在清潔的地方，等牠冷後，然後盛在缸的中，加入酒藥，和飯拌匀；倘使有液體流出，再加入酒麴和清水等，那末令漸漸的漲了起來，發了大熱，生小泡，每天須攪拌十幾回，以五六天爲度：再經過了兩三個月，把飯所變成的，混濁液汁，盛在綢做的袋内，拿到壓榨器上去榨，那就可以榨出液汁來，這液汁就是酒了，但是這酒我們還不可以飮喝，因爲這酒是生的，所以我們呌牠是生酒：這樣以後，再經過十幾天酒渣沉下缸底，就把生酒灌入壺内，放在鍋上蒸二十分鐘的時候而後，這酒便可以飮喝了丨因爲是熟了丨這大槪是做酒的方法。</p>
<p>酒的種類　酒的種類，因酒精成分的多寡，製酒原料的種類，與夫附加品物的不同，所以製成的酒，遂有種種的名稱：例如惠斯兄（Ｗｈｉｓｐｅｙ）含酒精４４％５５，勃蘭（Ｂｒａｎｄｙ）含酒精５０丨％５８／·像中國的高梁酒及汾酒等含酒精３－５％以上的酒的種類，大槪多是我們平日所飮喝的種類。</p>
<p>酒的益處和害處，飮酒少許，足以振起精神，活動筋骨，但是濫飮及亂飮對於腎臓，胃臟，神經，血管，都是有害，又能貽憂後世。凡世間的低能兒和不良兒，大半都是毫飮家的子孫。酒醉發狂，又爲犯罪的原因。所以各國都設法禁酒，或課以重稅，都沒有效果。像北美合衆國表面上已算禁絶，但是偷做</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>，偷運，偷飮的人，也還是多。他們的禁酒的成績，和我們中國的禁烟大約彷彿啊！</p>
<p>酒醉解醒的方法我們平日所飮的酒，不可多飮，倘使多飮，雖然是善於飮酒的人，也必易醉，倘使一旦飮醉，往往致禍，所以現在有一很簡便的方法，使醉者醒之，約略的一説：法拿醬油冲湯一碗，丨須待温和方可丨與醉者飮之，立即清醒如常。還有一法：就是拿酒倒入碗内，放皮蛋和糖在内，就是多飮一些，也不一致死醉。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3 id="c184">一個小小的建議 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我在本月五日的貴報裏，看見了徐君所述的「環境的壓迫」一文，不禁引起了我無限的感慨！現在的一般學徒們丨誰不是受了「環境的壓迫」和經濟的困難，不得已而棄了可愛的學校生活，再跑入這萬惡的社會裏的。</p>
<p>即如我，假使在幼年的時候，不受環境的影響，沒有意外的阻碍，能夠安好的結果；但至少總有相當的成績，足以自慰。</p>
<p>現在，我却是與徐君站在同一地位了。</p>
<p>以我本身的經騐而論：在環境支配之下，過的是呆板式的生活，無絲毫興趣之可言，故而終朝是悶悶不樂匠。我想大多數的學徒們，必定感到同樣的乏味。所以我們想打破這個苦悶，必須大家聯絡起來。以下便是我一個小小的建議：</p>
<p>第一步，凡在　欄通訊的學徒，希望先生從中介紹，使得我們可以自由倘若因此使性情相近的能漸漸熟悉起來，感情便可由此融治。</p>
<p>第二步，感情融治之後，便可進一步而成爲知己的朋友。那末，將來於事業方面，可以彼此扶助。就是於生活改進和學識修養，也是大有裨益的。</p>
<p>以上便是我的一點愚見，未知徐君見了以爲如何？同時並希望本市的學徒們，大家提出意見來討論討論。至於具體的方法，那是要請熱忱的先生以站在－</p>
<p>領導地位的態度，來指示我們一個進行的方針。洪明昌十二·八·</p>
<p>編者按：在同樣生活方式之下，其所遭受的苦樂，大都份當然是一致的。</p>
<p>所以，自從徐君覺人「環境的壓追」一封信發表以後，我們接二連三的收到類似的信真多啊！不昌説自己的薪水有限不足以維持家庭，便是説終日在過着牛馬的生活無機會讀書閱報：不是説自從父親死後沒法償還大批債欵，便是説母老妹幼眼看喪嫁等費毫無着落······簡直舉不勝舉。總括的説：無非是因爲生活的悲慘，和經　的恐慌，想打出一條出路來。</p>
<p>這些信使我們看了，足夠封封吊淚丨深表無限的同情。我們想竭力設法解决這些因難的問題，吹用了大家的悉雲，使大家的生活都能滿足；但是，我們有什麽法子呢？我們要曉得社會上的一切都是息息相關的，在這個内憂外患交迫之際，在這個市塲不景氣和農村破產的環境之中；我們可以説：諸君的問題都不是個人的而是社會的，也不是個人的低能，而是現社會根本發生了缺陷。不將這個缺陷糾正了改造了，則個人的問題是永遠無法解。</p>
<p>我們更須曉得的，徒然的「仰屋興嗟」是不中用的；嗟嘆自是嗟嘆，痛苦不還是痛苦嗎？愁苦之神不會像燕子那樣的膽小，被你一嗟嘆就駭跑的，若不馬上想出有效的辦法驅逐牠，牠將常常的來光顧你。但是，有效的辦法在何處呢？牠不在「天之涯，海之角，」仍在各人的自身。最先能夠有見及此而且能打破悲慘愁悶的空氣的，要推洪君的來信了！</p>
<p>洪君信中所説的辦法雖屬仍是原則的初步的，但極有公開討論的價值，在本星期日（十一日）業餘周刋第二期的業餘漫譚裏面，記者已經約略睥提過，現在就將　發表在下面，希望一般朋友們集中力量對準這個目標發抒偉見吧。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「怎樣有些肚子痛！：：：」痛得很厲害！在東溝登岸的時候，我因爲已聽大經三令五申的限制你到了浴塲，不許下水，便故意哼起肚子痛來，結果自然是别人一齊下水，我却得了陪伴你的好差使。</p>
<p>「我們走過去喝幾杯冰淇淋吧！」我快活得彷佛突然减少了十年的年紀。挽着你的一支又白，又嫩，又爽滑，像用象牙製的雕刻品一般的手臂，一路笑，一路跳的望一座竹桿和蘆蓆所搭的飮冰室奔去。</p>
<p>「不錯！肚子痛應該多喝幾杯冰淇淋！」你那流利活潑，美得跟天上的星一般無二的眸子裏，透着一種一半是歡喜，一半是調倪的笑意向我煽動着。我自己也忍不住失聲笑了。</p>
<p>小朋友！小猪　！弟！丨你是一個男人，不是一個女人。丨你實在是世界上最美麗，最聰慧的一個小精靈！我永遠崇拜着。</p>
<p>我自己也承認，我這一個人底情感衝動，的確有些過火：往往在失意或得意的時候，有許多反常的舉動。那一天，當然我是很得意了，於是一杯一杯的美女牌冰淇淋，便像一口清水一般不費事的裝進了我的肚子去。一霎時，已經是第六杯的開始了。</p>
<p>「不許喝了！」你伸手搶了去。</p>
<p>「好！祇這一杯，讓我再喝了吧！」我像一個頑皮的孩子一様地，向他的母親厮纒着。同時，竟張開着五條手指，準備實行强刦的下策了。</p>
<p>雖然，我們的臉上，都有極真誠的笑在那裏浮着，但是彼此都不肯放棄自己的主張：一杯冰淇淋，便成了雙方爭奪的目標。最後，你眼看不能抵敵我了：不料靈巧的你，竟把這目的物一　手，丢到了地上去，同時伸長你的足尖，祇一脚便解决一切。</p>
<p>你顯然是勝利了，便伏在我的膝蓋上笑得像　。</p>
<p>「他們好親熱啊！」旁座上的人，在悄悄地發出一種艷羨的耳語來。</p>
<p>「他們：：：他們是什麽？」我俯在你的耳朵上問着。</p>
<p>「他們大槪是兄妹吧！」你含糊着答復。</p>
<p>「不！多分是表兄妹！」我很得意地調笑着。</p>
<p>哈哈！親愛的小朋友！你瞧，我把這件事情記得多麽仔細啊！老實説，衹要有你和我在一起的時候所有的一切經過，都像烙鐵烙過一般的，牢牢地刻在我的腦神筋上了。</p>
<p>就是最普通，最簡單的一個小動作，也是决不會遺漏的。</p>
<p>在高橋是爲了得意的剌激而大喝冰淇淋，在霞飛路是爲了失意的剌激而大喝冰淇淋，雖然同樣是剌激，不過中高橋的時候，有你在旁邊限制着我，因此並沒有過分；這一天，旁邊的那些羅宋姑娘們，爲着她們的生意起見，慫恿之不遑，那有再來勸阻之理！於是在五十分鐘之内，我竟一口氣的喝完了，不，簡直是呑完了五大杯的冰淇淋。末了，還加上兩大杯赤荳刨冰。真可謂極喝水之能事了！</p>
<p>不過，人究竟不是鐵打的！半天功夫的風雨，和多量的冷飮，終於在我躺在床上的時候，一齊發作了。嘔吐，泄瀉，發熱，不約而同地走來和我握手了。當第二天，丨便是我起身的那一天的清晨·太陽光從窗口上慢慢地伸起牠的頭來，隔着玻璃，向我發出一種奚落的訕笑：我一着腦，便死命的掙扎了起來。頭像孫行者聽了禁篐咒一般的痛，痛得似乎己經裂開來分了幾片了。</p>
<p>「啊！今天真不能走了！」勉强爬下了床，不料身子竟像裝進了一袋棉花堆裏，晃晃蕩蕩的老是站不直；兩條腿也崛得再不肯服從我的命令，走一步路簡直比爬一座山還難。因此，我就起了遲一天再動身的一個半消極的念頭。（未完）</p>

<p>— 凛</p>
<p>影戲是處處寫實的，所以宇宙間的萬物，凡人所看得見的，影片裏亦應當看得見，於是珍禽異獸毒蛇蟲豸之屬，亦得時時於影片中見之以擴我人之眼界。好萊塢各影片公司中，需用各種動物最多者莫如派拉蒙。而派拉蒙的一位採辦科主任比爾斯氏ＰｕｓｓｅｌＰｉｅｒｃｅ亦頗有廣搜搏採之才，所以公司方面，無論需要什麽東西，他總能設法弄到，從來不辱使命。不多時以前，這位比爾斯君，奉到公司方面的命令，呌他尋覓Ｃｒｉｍｓｏｎｆｏｌｍｉｃｉｄａｅ兩千個。當然Ｃｒｉｍｓｏｎ係紅色的，但是ｆｏｒｍｉｅｉｄａｅ是什麽東西，比爾斯却從來沒有聽見過，於是他就翻起外國康煕字典來，原來那就是一種紅色螞蟻的科學名稱，這紅蟻作什麽用呢？是用在『獸中之王』一片裏的，其中有一幕有兩個獵人，爲獅所殺，伹紅蟻竟聚而合二人之屍，頃刻而盡，比爾斯於是就在加利福尼亞省南部，四方尋覓這種可怖的紅蟻聚集之所。却巧有一位先生，在他的花園發見了這種紅蟻，想設法驅滅。比爾斯於是就同他商量了，用蜜糖　　引誘紅蟻，裝入罐頭裏，拿到影片場中應用去了。</p>
<p>比爾斯對於尋覓以及訓練各種獸類是覺得沒有什麽因難的，但是平常的訓練與攝影場中萬盞强烈燈光之下是絶然不同的。往往一獸經過長時期訓練，一到攝影場中，就呆若木鷄，或竟因驚懼而顯露其暴烈的本性。再則獅子老虎等猛獸，祇認得訓練牠的人，别人一槪不買賬的。有一次派拉蒙拍馬戲中的一幕，有一隻獅子拍了一早晨的戲，真是馴如貓兎，在那訓練員在場的時候，一切演員同牠厮混在一起，一點也沒有怕懼。到了吃中飯的時候，訓練員去吃飯了·獅子的籠子放在攝影塲中，有幾位演員，因爲同牠玩了一早晨，以爲牠是極和善的，仍舊近籠去逗弄那獅子。那知那獅子看見訓練並不在旁邊，就向那進籠的人撲過去，兩個同時被獅子撲倒在地。幸虧訓練員趕到，救了兩個人的性命，但是那危險，真是間不容髮的。</p>

<p>— 學范</p>
<p>我們感覺得近來影片的出版數量，雖則很大；但他們的描述的目光，太偏重於一面了。人事是這樣的複雜人生又那樣的變幻，難道劇本的取材，只有轉來轉去，僅僅於這男女之間嗎？我們到影場裏所見到的；只是戀愛的故事，我們誠有些看得膩了！我們也明白製片家的目光，偏重於戀愛，爲迎合一般觀衆，故影片的故事，不管通不通，影片的設備，不管健全不健全，只要片中有男有女，談情説愛，就草率地公演了。固然這種影片也能受一部分人的歡迎，但這方面的成功，是影片本身的失敗！」</p>
<p>我並非絶對反對影片不該叙述戀愛的故事我的意思是：於戀愛故事之外，有許多的人生的片段，可以描述，有不少可以諷刺的，悲歌的各方面的人生，作爲影片的材料。如果導演的目光能四射到他的周圍，那裏沒有好資料呢？假若目光能到下層階級去，則其成就更無限量了！我們試看現在一大堆的國產影片中，談戀愛，描寫的影片那張值得人們的歌頌？而只有一張「人道」是比較成功的，總之　目前的我國社會，似乎不需要　　之音，紙迷金醉的劇材；而需要一種怎樣剌激這垂死的民族，使改造一個民族的新生？諸位智慧的編劇家！不知你們於意如何？</p>

<h3 id="c190">雷門諾伐羅的發跡（下） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 希孟</p>
<p>他在浪漫的藝術界裏，混跡了幾年，後來就從紐約去到落杉磯（好萊塢的所在），他就脫離了瑪琳穆根的歌舞圑，去尋求他一千塊錢一個星期的夢想的實現。那時候，他的同國人凡倫鐵諾，已經成名，美國全電影界的人們，崇拜他如同一個偶像。但雷門諾伐羅，無忮無求的，繼續他的工作，亦頗能自得其樂。</p>
<p>造就凡倫鐵諾的聲望的，就是藍克斯恩格藍姆Ｒｅｘｌｎｇｒａｍ那時恩格藍姆正從事於ＴｈｐｒｉｓｏｎｅｒｏｆＺｅｎｃａ的攝製，ＲｕｐｅｌｔｌｆＨｅｎｔｚａｕ的飾角還沒有尋到。雷門當時已經演過一張片子，但經騐還不十分豐富。他從朋友處得了一副介紹信，就去見恩格藍姆。</p>
<p>恩格藍姆對他看了一眼，搖搖頭。他説「對不起得很，你的形貎却巧與我劇中人相反Ｒｕｐｅｒｔ人甚高，皮　白晢，態度高倨，年紀亦比你大些」那時雷門年紀不過二十二歲，黑睛黑髮，完全是墨西哥人的代表。</p>
<p>雷門一時係失敗了，但他請求恩格藍姆無妨讓他試試，恩格藍姆告訴他，明天可以再來，但切不可存奢望，因爲他的機會，幾如登天般難。雷門又請恩格藍姆告訴他劇中人的品格形貎，到底是怎樣的，恩格藍姆就在他的介紹信的背後，寫了許多字交給雷門，呌他回去吧。</p>
<p>雷門似乎很失望的取回了他介紹信，踱到家裏，細細將劇中人的身份形狀，研究了一番。他忽然跳了起來，跑到一家服裝店裏，選購了一套服裝，明天一早跑到恩格藍姆那裏。恩格藍姆拾起頭來一看，驚奇得張開了口説不出話來，原來雷門的形狀，已經更改得與理想上的劇中人一般無二。後來恩格藍姆，又仔仔細細看了他一回，就替他戴上了一只單眼眼鏡。雷門諾伐羅的臉，那時還很平滑，單眼眼鏡，戴上去就滑下來，但劇中ＲｕｐｅｒｌｏｆＨｅｎｔｚａ一角，是雷門諾伐羅莫屬了。這就是他發跡成爲大明星的開始。（完）</p>

<p>馬陋芬在十三歲的時候，在城内九畝地的萬竹小學讀書；那時候，恰巧黎家小妹妹，因慕萬竹的聲譽，特地女扮男裝，也來求學。她的班次，恰與馬君相同；很巧不過的，她又與馬君同坐一隻椅子。在起初，當然，誰也不知道　純的小學校中，暮地裡裡跑出一位女性來。但是日子久了，黎妹妹的舉止行動，就不免給人家看出破綻；更以她生得美婉動人，於是就有幾個同學，格外的與她親近。而馬陋芬呢，自然，「近水樓台先得月」，他們倆在學校裏，幾乎形影不離；每逢放假的日子，馬君常租了一輛脚踏車，讓黎妹妹坐在他的後面，到鄛間冷靜的地方去飛馳着玩。當時一種親𠽋的形態，確會惹起全班同學的酸勁。二學期後，他們公注意的人太多了，於是就一同轉學出去，但是他倆的感情，仍很熱烈，以後黎家妹妹，投身歌舞界，而馬君也便追隨左右；不過後來黎妹妹的名望太大了，致使馬君有望塵莫及之嘆。但是黎妹妹終於是不忘情的，這樣，馬陋芬便在黎妹妹與她的小父親錦暉的獎掖扶持下，成就了今日這様的地位。</p>

<p>無論那一個戲院都有説明書，牠的責任是在告訴你這本戲中的劇情。以我的經騐來説，最好在電影未開映以前，不許看説明書。</p>
<p>理由是這様的：如果你看過了説明書，那就預先曉得劇情，於是電影　映時必定引不起你十分的興趣。　如一個女人被二個男子戀愛着，如果我們早已知道某一男子是得勝的，那是多末的乏味！預知了劇情，你的精神就會鬆弛，一些都不會緊張起來。</p>

<h3 id="c194">自由擠淚的習慣 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>最難分别哭和笑的就是我們這一雙眼睛。做哭的表情所以常常能夠像笑的緣故就是因爲眼神太足。人在笑的時精审是積極的，所以眼光集中；哭的時候精神是消極的，所以眼光散漫。不用一滴眼淚的帮助，你試對照相機留下一個哭的形態來，結果往往像笑。這就是因爲眼光太集中了的緣故。</p>
<p>大攝影塲裏拍哭的『特寫』（Ｃｏｓｅｉｎ）的時候，除了少數明星已經練成自由擠淚的習慣者外，普通都是把甘油Ｇｌｙｃｅｒｉｎ）滴進演員眼眶裏去以代真淚。兩滴眼淚緩緩地流下臉來竟可以把哭的表情底種種弱點完全掩蔽起來。由此可見眼淚在哭的表情上有多大的價值了。</p>
<p>用甘油的方法雖然是很巧妙，但是在滴進眼眶去的時候，那種味兒就和眼病患者由醫生滴進眼藥去的味兒差不多。滴進甘油之後，你還得把眼皮關閉起來，等待着發光和鏡頭全配好了，然後在開鏡頭的時候，用勁去擠出那兩滴甘油來，無論如何總顯得有點不自然的。</p>
<p>因爲這個緣故，我們在練習的時候應當『取法乎上』，及早練成這種自由擠淚的習慣。在沒有經騐的人看來，或者以爲這是不可能的事。其實只要你肯在心理和呼吸兩方面各用一點功夫，自由擠淚並不是一件難事。</p>

The original text declares that the Chinese and Soviet governments have, from this day forward, resumed formal diplomatic relations, exchanging ambassadors and consuls as usual.

<p>(Nanjing) Bian Dingyuan, Section Chief of the Ministry of Finance, telegraphed Deng Mianren in Shanghai, "To Deng Mianren, Director of the Shanghai Central Bank: This Ministry's wireless radio station faces north across the corridor, where public servants usually reside. At 10:05 AM today, a fire broke out for unknown reasons. Clerk Tong ascended the building, saw the fire, and cried for help. Upon being notified, the Section Chief, along with staff, soldiers, and laborers, rushed to put out the fire and rescued important files from each department. Due to strong winds, various fire brigades arrived to provide assistance. Approximately five interconnected upper-story rooms, one building housing the wireless radio station, the Public Debt Department, and the Secretariat, plus three corridors, were completely destroyed.

<p>At 10:00 AM, carelessness suddenly caused a fire. At the time, the wind was very strong, and the flames blazed fiercely. Various fire brigades arrived to do their utmost to extinguish the blaze. Meanwhile, military police were deployed nearby to maintain order. By 11:30 AM, the fire was put out. The Secretariat's filing room, the Tax Department's filing room, a wireless radio room, two workers' dormitories, and four corridors were destroyed. All important files were temporarily rescued, with only a small portion of less important documents being burned. A small part of the electrical equipment was also damaged. The source of the fire is said to be the workers' dormitory on the upper floor of the third southern building. There are various theories regarding the cause of the fire. Some say it was caused by workers smoking cigarettes and leaving behind embers, while others say it was due to workers burning charcoal indoors carelessly, causing the fire to spread. Two workers suspected of being involved have been taken to the First Police Bureau for questioning but have not provided any useful information. They have since been returned to the Ministry of Finance for interrogation. After the incident, the Ministry's General Affairs Department urgently telegraphed Minister Song, who was in, and Deng Mianren, Director of the General Affairs Department, reporting the incident and requesting instructions. Upon receiving the telegram, Deng immediately came to Nanjing to handle all matters. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) Cai Tingkai is going to the provincial capital and is expected to return to Zhangzhou on the 13th. The reasons for the delay in assuming the post of Pacification Commissioner are: 1) The issue of Liu Zhennian's troops being under the jurisdiction of the Fujian Pacification Headquarters has been telegraphed to the Central Government for instructions; 2) The issue of Guangdong continuing to allocate 300,000 in funds is awaiting resolution. Once Liu's troops are placed under jurisdiction and the provincial government is established, Guangdong will continue to provide funds. Therefore, he is returning first and will assume the post after the New Year when things are resolved. Cai's younger brother, Langkai, arrived from Guangdong on the 12th and immediately went to Zhangzhou. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e12">U.S. and Russia Angered by Actions of League of Nations; U.S. Non-Participation is a Warning; Russian Foreign Minister Also Indicates Non-Participation; Will the 19-Member Committee Change its Plans? <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The arrival of Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov in Geneva today has led to many rumors. Official circles say Litvinov is here because of the disarmament issue, but many believe Litvinov is active in many areas, not just disarmament. Some say Litvinov will conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan here. Judging from Matsuoka's speech at the assembly last Thursday, this statement does not seem entirely groundless. It is also expected that Litvinov will discuss cooperation between the 19-member committee and the Soviet Union. Russian sources say the Soviet Union has no intention of participating in the League of Nations' troubled affairs, but many believe the Soviet Union will participate in discussions but does not want to be left out. The situation is different for the United States. The League of Nations has now received a strong hint from the United States that if it does not align with the U.S. position, the U.S. government will not participate in the work of the 19-member committee. This warning has caused those who expected the 19-member committee's work to proceed smoothly to change their plans. It is now believed that the committee will spend the entire week trying to find a solution. Matsuoka's statement that any arbitrary actions on the Sino-Japanese issue will have consequences that the proposers did not anticipate will make the committee's discussions extremely difficult. Therefore, a major crisis may occur this week. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) With the issue of equality in armaments resolved, Geneva is now focusing on the Far East dispute. The 19-member committee will meet today. Because the issue is complex and serious, the meeting will be held in secret. Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov arrived here today and, in addition to reiterating Russia's neutrality on the Sino-Japanese dispute, refused to make any statements. It is widely believed that Russia will be invited to join the discussions immediately, without waiting until the principles of mediation have been established. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) After arriving here today, Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov told several acquaintances that the Soviet Union feels no obligation to pull the League of Nations' chestnuts out of the fire. It is reported that Litvinov is tired of participating in any discussions in the League of Nations, believing that the League of Nations has considered over one hundred disputes in the past fifteen months but has never felt obligated to invite Russia to participate. Therefore, Litvinov feels that the Soviet Union can refrain from asking about the League of Nations' current problems. Litvinov spoke with German Foreign Minister Newton for a long time after arriving in Geneva today. Newton left for his country immediately afterward. According to those close to Litvinov, Litvinov came to Geneva because it was said that the Soviet Union had joined other countries in burying the International Disarmament Conference. Therefore, the only event in Geneva that Litvinov is paying attention to is disarmament. It is widely rumored that Litvinov came here to discuss a non-aggression treaty with the Japanese representative, but those who claim to know Litvinov's purpose well have denied this claim.</p>

<p>(Geneva) According to diplomatic circles here, because Britain and France are openly protecting Japan in the League of Nations Assembly, promoting the Japanese military's atrocities, and have no sincerity in upholding justice, the U.S. and Russia cannot easily cooperate with the League of Nations. Although the 19-nation committee, at the suggestion of British Foreign Secretary Simon, organized a mediation committee and invited the U.S. and Russia to participate, Russia stated that the Manchurian Incident occurred fifteen months ago. The League of Nations has taken no countermeasures and has allowed the Japanese military to act arbitrarily. Although it has repeatedly stated that it will mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute, it has not taken active steps and has not expressed goodwill in inviting Russia and the U.S. to participate. Now that things have reached this point, Russia is invited to share this responsibility, but Russia cannot easily agree to this. The U.S. has stated that unless the League of Nations expresses its determination to uphold justice and support the covenant, the U.S. is unwilling to participate as a tool for Japan to promote the destruction of China. If the U.S. and Russia are firmly invited to participate, the two major powers of Britain and France, which control the League of Nations, must go through a self-reproach. Therefore, the participation of the U.S. and Russia has become hopeless. However, if Britain and France repent, the League of Nations will unanimously deny the puppet organization and resolve that Japan is an aggressor nation. This would be tantamount to making Japan leave the League of Nations. It is expected that the League of Nations will fall into an irreparable deadlock again by the end of this week.

<p>(Tokyo) British representative Sir John Simon's proposal to establish a mediation committee was relayed by representative Matsuoka, requesting instructions. As a result of consultations between Foreign Minister Uchida, the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the military, a reply was sent on the night of the 10th as follows: 1) The Imperial Government, based on the principles of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, does not recognize the authority of the 19-nation committee or other special committees to mediate under Article 15, paragraph 3. Therefore, any resolutions of the committee cannot be binding. 2) The proposal of the 19-nation committee to invite the U.S. and Russia cannot be approved in principle. Moreover, the Lytton Report and Japan's written opinion have been submitted to the League of Nations Council. Therefore, entrusting a special committee with non-member states (Russia) is unreasonable. 3) The Japanese government has stated its opposition to the League of Nations' attitude of inviting the U.S. and Russia. It will abstain from voting on the resolution and continue to maintain a watching attitude. The mediation committee disregards Japan's written opinion and has no basis.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang and his wife, along with Secretary Deng Wenyi and over 30 attendants, left Wuhan on the 10th aboard the Yong Sui warship, escorted by Chu You. On the morning of the 11th at 9:00 AM, they passed Jiujiang and arrived at Hukou to inspect the Shizhongshan Fortress and pay respects at the Zeng-Peng Shrine. They left Hukou at noon and passed Madang at 3:00 PM to inspect the Madang Fortress. They inspected the civilian situation in Jiangjiawan Town and boarded the ship at 5:00 PM. At 8:00 PM, they passed Anqing and arrived at Xiaguan at noon on the 12th. They plan to stay in Nanjing for two months before departing again to suppress bandits. The headquarters staff will remain in Wuhan. The Capital Gendarmerie Command and the Police Department added patrols along the route on the morning of the 12th. The commander of the 87th Division, Tu Jingjiu, led a special company to guard the wharf. Those who went to Xiaguan to welcome him included Dai Chuanxian, Shi Qingyang, Luo Wengan, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Qun, Ye Chucang, Zhu Peide, Chen Shuren, Shi Ying, Wang Boling, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Yao Zong, Zhou Yawei, Chen Yi, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Siyu, Gu Zhenglun, Xiong Shihui, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, Ding Chaowu, Zhou Qigang, Peng Xuepei, Zhang Zhijiang, Fang Zhenwu, Zhang Yipeng, Fang Jue, Zhao Pilian, Miao Peicheng, Zhang Mojun, and approximately one thousand people, including various Mongolian princes, representatives, and groups. Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan boarded a small boat on the morning of the 12th to greet him and personally took care of him. At 12:30 PM, the Yong Sui docked, and a 19-gun salute was fired to welcome him. Chiang greeted the welcomers with a smile. Chiang wore a yellow wool Sun Yat-sen suit, a black coat, a yellow wool top hat, and black leather shoes. He looked very well, but thinner than when he left Nanjing. He disembarked with his wife and took car number 515 directly to his private residence at the military academy to rest. Chairman Lin personally visited to express his sympathy. At 1:30 PM, Chiang and his entourage took cars number 525 and 527 to Chairman Lin's private residence in Shibanqiao to return the visit. After a brief conversation, they left and went to the flower archway on Yanling Lane, then to Zhongzheng Street, and turned onto Zhonghua Road, heading directly to Zhonghua Gate to inspect the construction of the Nanjing city. At 1:50 PM, they returned to their residence. According to Chiang's aides, Chiang spent six months in Wuhan actively suppressing bandits, and the remaining bandits are expected to be wiped out in two months. Chiang's return to Nanjing is purely to attend the Second Plenary Session. After one month, he will return to Wuhan. The duties of the headquarters in Wuhan will be handled by Chief of Staff Cao Haosen and Secretary-General Yang Yongtai respectively. The joint proposals of Chiang and Wang for the Third Plenary Session were brought to Nanjing some days ago. They include suggestions on internal affairs, foreign affairs, bandit suppression, and other important policies. Due to the fatigue of the journey, Chiang, along with Soong Mei-ling and bodyguards, went to Tangshan to bathe at around 3:00 PM and returned to the city to his residence at 5:30 PM to rest.

The standard for the conference representatives is 1,600 people, with 600 people allocated to government agencies (10 people per agency) and 1,000 people to organizations. A letter will be sent to Chiang requesting him to attend the conference to give instructions so that they can listen to his teachings and know what to follow. (Central Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chiang arrived in Nanjing, he returned to the official residence of the Central Military Academy. In the afternoon, Chairman Lin of the National Government personally visited the Military Academy to visit him and express his sympathy. At 1:30 PM, Chiang led four followers to Lin's private residence in Shibanqiao to pay a visit. He then said goodbye and took a car from Shibanqiao to Yanggong Temple in Bieting Lane and turned into Taiping Road, folded to Zhonghua Road, inspecting the urban conditions and road engineering and returned to the Military Academy. He then received various key figures and military and political leaders.

<p>(Tokyo) It is widely rumored in Geneva that the 19-nation committee will be reduced to a seven-nation committee consisting of China, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, the United States, and Russia, which are directly related to the Sino-Japanese issue, to consider methods of mediating the Sino-Japanese issue. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its absolute opposition to this matter for the following reasons: 1) The Japanese government has established a policy of seeking a solution to the Sino-Japanese issue through direct negotiations between the two countries and absolutely opposes interference by third countries. Therefore, Japan will not participate in any committees organized by the League of Nations. 2) If the mediation committee has the nature of binding Japan's future position, Japan will actively oppose the establishment of the committee. 3) Opposition to the participation of the U.S. and Russia. 4) The League of Nations has established a mediation committee, limiting its self-purpose to reviewing the Lipton Report and the opinions of China and Japan, or studying the issue of reforming China's internal affairs.

<p>(Geneva) Chinese Representative Dr. Yan Huiqing today submitted a document to the League of Nations stating that the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Ambassador to China on December 6 regarding the massacre of Chinese people in Fushun. Japanese Representative Nagaoka has sent a message to the League of Nations today, saying that on December 8, a Japanese armored train traveled from the front to Shanhaiguan and was bombed by Chinese soldiers near the Great Wall, so the armored train also returned fire. In order to resolve this matter, military authorities from China and Japan have sent personnel to Shanhaiguan. The Japanese authorities there are determined to make efforts to prevent the matter from escalating. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e23">Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George Discusses the Far East Situation; World Opinion Has Tilted Towards China Due to the Lipton Report; Japan's Aggressive Policies Have Created International Anarchy <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The United States Bears a Heavy Responsibility for the Future of the Issue</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berlin Bolsen Guide published an article today by former British Prime Minister Lloyd George on the Far East situation, which has attracted great attention. George expressed his view that although the Lipton Report has described the Far East issue, it has not changed the situation. At the same time, world opinion has tilted towards China due to the Lipton Report.</p>
<p>George further compared Japan's actions in Manchuria with Britain's actions in Egypt and stated that in his youth, he followed John Bright in attacking the policies of the British government. He now has many reasons to allow Japan to continue to safely implement its current policies. It is questionable whether these reasons are sound. George's personal opinion is that if these reasons are indeed sound, then the previous great war in Europe was meaningless. Then we are currently going backwards, returning to the path before the war, and creating international anarchy and the aggression of imperialism.</p>
<p>George further stated that the Manchurian issue is a touchstone to test whether an international document containing unexpected consensus and rich source material, such as the Lipton Report, can transform from words into reality through the power of world opinion. As for pressure, there is no hope other than the pressure of world opinion. At this time, all countries can only offer verbal protests, and each country has its own economic and political concerns that cannot be alleviated by war.</p>
<p>George finally placed a heavy responsibility on the United States, because unless the United States can intervene forcefully, other countries can do nothing. George concluded that (this is a great opportunity for the United States). (National Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Bombardment of Shanhaiguan and Obscurity of the New Army Reduction Plan <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(1) Japan, in the League of Nations Special Assembly, has already been rejected by countries upholding justice. Although one or two national representatives have been misled, it still cannot conceal the fact of its military aggression. However, to maintain its so-called "accomplished facts," it cannot but fabricate new false facts to cover up the old fabricated facts.</p>
<p>First, it seeks to divert international attention from old problems by creating new ones. The (Manchukuo (puppet) state) is known by even three-year-olds to be a fabrication of Japanese militarists, intended to alleviate international opposition. It is difficult in principle to allow it to monopolize the three northeastern provinces, and even more unacceptable to allow it to dominate the Far Eastern market. The Japanese clique is aware of this. Therefore, it seeks British understanding in various ways, using the opening of the "Manchurian" door as a condition and further military disturbances as a threat.</p>
<p>Second, after the fall of the three northeastern provinces, apart from the Chinese army's unresisting withdrawal, the so-called reform of old malpractices, the so-called maintenance of order, and the so-called security of foreign residents' lives and property are all false rhetoric. The corruption of Japanese officials even surpasses that of their militarists. As for order, there is only chaos. British residents are often kidnapped, and others are even more like meat on the chopping block. To cover up its ugliness, it must create a more tense situation to maintain the existence of its puppet regime.</p>
<p>Thus, on the night of the eighth of this month, Shanhaiguan was once again shaken by the sound of artillery fire. A large detachment of Japanese troops has been added to the Rehe border. Regardless of whether it is just a bluff or a further military disturbance, the powerlessness of international treaties and the tyranny of Japanese militarists are already known to the world. Can our country continue to endure being slaughtered without immediately engaging in a life-and-death struggle?</p>
<p>(2) Although Japan adopts an aggressive offensive against China, it cannot but wear a mask of benevolence, righteousness, and morality towards the great powers, especially expressing agreement on arms reduction. But what about its proposed new arms reduction plan? According to a Geneva dispatch on the 5th, the content of the new arms reduction plan proposed by Japan's Tsuneo Matsudaira and Haruo Sato is as follows:</p>
<p>"Part 1 (Establish Agreement): Britain and the United States at 11, Japan at 8. The standard is to distinguish between defensive and offensive capabilities, abolish aircraft carriers, and reduce battleships from 35,000 tons to 25,000 tons. Main gun caliber reduced from 16 inches to 14 inches. Ocean-going ships reduced from 10,000 tons to 8,000 tons. Submarines reduced from 2,000 tons to 1,800 tons." Maintaining submarines is most advantageous, especially in waters near Japan. "All five major naval powers should positively reduce the relative nature of their battleships and cruisers. Each country should determine the maximum limit of total tonnage based on its geographical location and special circumstances. Its actual military strength should be based on its existing holdings. Part 2 (Special Agreement): Based on the direct interests of various countries in the world, and distinguished by region (such as the Pacific group, the Atlantic group, the European group, the South American group). Based on the agreement in Part 1, reduce the number of ships currently maintained by each country as much as possible."</p>
<p>(3) Judging only from the surface, this proposal of Japan's, even if it does not fundamentally reduce armaments, seems quite sincere in reducing naval quality and quantity, giving a sense of striving for human happiness and world peace. But examining its content closely and connecting it with the bombardment of Shanhaiguan, the invasion of Rehe, and the slaughter of the people of Northeast China, the so-called mask of peace has been completely shattered.</p>
<p>What is the difference between 16-inch guns and 14-inch guns? What is the difference between 10,000 tons and 8,000 tons? And wasn't the submarine the only weapon that incited the United States to join during the European war? Moreover, what Japan values most is, first, the monopoly of the Far Eastern market; second, the naval ports of the Philippines and Guam; and third, sea control in the Pacific. If battleships are reduced and aircraft carriers are abandoned, it will be extremely difficult for the United States to maintain its market on the western coast of the Pacific. The naval bases in the Philippines and Guam will fall into enemy hands, and hegemony on the Pacific Ocean, except for the California coast, will likely no longer be shared with the United States. And restricting offensive capabilities specifically restricts the United States' offensive capabilities, restricting it from crossing the Pacific.</p>
<p>Japan, on the other hand, takes advantage of this opportunity, utilizing its small and highly efficient naval organization, not only to soar in the East China Sea but also to invade the hinterland of our country, using the name of protecting overseas Chinese to carry out its monopolistic market domination. What is especially feared is that if the mask of arms reduction is successfully created, the sound of artillery fire in Shanhaiguan will reach west of the Yellow River, and the iron hooves trampling Liaodong will likely traverse Rehe and then reach Youyan. The great powers may be deceived by sweet words and shocked by the current situation, while our country will bear the brunt, experiencing all the suffering. Can it not immediately rise up and engage in a life-and-death struggle with the enemy?</p>

<p>[P Sichuan Generals Unanimously Endorse Zhang Qun's Telegram Advocating that Zhang Submit a Request to the Central Government for Adoption and that Liu Wenhui's Troops Retreat to Xinjin&gt;</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Zhang Qun's telegram (dated the 29th of last month) advocated the establishment of a Sichuan Political Reorganization Committee and the reorganization of Sichuan politics based on the National Government's explicit order of the 17th year of the Republic. Sichuan generals have successively replied by telegram endorsing it. On the 12th, another telegram was received from Deng Xihou (dated the 7th) and a telegram from Tian Songyao (dated the 5th). Zhang's advocacy has now won the support of all the generals in Sichuan. Zhang will submit a request to the Central Government and hopes it will be adopted. If accepted, he will further formulate concrete measures to bring Sichuan politics into order. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Tian Songyao's telegram to Zhang Qun regarding the method of eliminating the Sichuan war stated: "Your esteemed telegram has been respectfully received. I deeply admire your brother's painstaking efforts to eliminate the scourge of war and stabilize the homeland in Sichuan. I also strongly advocate that Sichuan affairs be resolved through political methods. Your brother's proposal to reorganize Sichuan politics, based on the Central Government's mandate and adopting public opinion in Sichuan, establishing a committee with representatives from the gentry and people to openly discuss implementation measures, to resolve disputes and open up a new situation, is something I greatly admire and endorse. I am now proclaiming this to the public and friendly armies, hoping that you, brother, will exert great efforts to realize it as soon as possible. However, I would like to add that with the national crisis at hand, internal strife is constantly occurring. No person of insight does not feel pained by this. The Central Government and the people of the country unanimously avoid mentioning civil war, but they do not know that if the root of civil war is not removed, the outbreak of civil war is inevitable. If they avoid treatment and only know how to perfunctorily mediate, not only will they lose prestige, but they may also be unable to quell the scourge. For the sake of the Central Government, they should clearly distinguish right from wrong to determine justice. Anyone who raises troops and causes trouble, and is not supported by public opinion and is difficult to condone in principle, should be ordered to be sanctioned once it is verified. If they refuse to submit to sanctions, they should be explicitly ordered to be suppressed. Rewards should come from utmost impartiality, and likes and dislikes should be shared with the people, so that the fundamental principles can be revitalized and civil war can be eliminated. This is not only for the sake of Sichuan affairs. However, the dispute in Sichuan has been going on for more than two months. The Central Government cannot but understand the rights and wrongs of the matter and the direction of the people's hearts. Therefore, the Central Government should quickly deal with it to relieve the suffering of the people and alleviate the worries in the west, and should not sit and listen to the evolution of the situation. I hope that you will report this to the Central Government, and I especially hope that my brother will exert great efforts. Sincerely replying, please forgive my ignorance. Your younger brother, Tian Songyao, bows." (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>

It is rumored that Zhu swallowed a snake bone, which caused poisoning and death, but those who ate with him were all unharmed. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e57">British Government's Note to the U.S. on War Debts Expires, Payment Still Made <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>However, declaration made that it cannot be regarded as a recurrence of the repayment system; further negotiations are necessary before next June. ▲ London, 11th (Reuters) – Today, the British government issued a note to the U.S. State Department stating that the December 15th debt installment will be paid in gold. This is because, under the current circumstances, it is the least burdensome method for the British government. It was then clearly stated that this payment must be regarded as the last batch under the existing Anglo-American war debt agreement and cannot be seen as the beginning of a renewed payment of the amounts stipulated in that agreement. This payment is only being made because time is too short for further discussion. Moreover, the U.S.'s insistence on this payment greatly increases the hope of re-examining the entire war debt structure. Therefore, it is specifically declared that the amount paid this time must be regarded as part of the final settlement amount in the future. It also emphasized the importance of both countries exchanging views on the war debt issue as soon as possible, urging negotiations on this matter before June 15th next year to avoid the risk of total destruction of current international agreements. Britain still firmly believes that there is no other way to reduce the danger of exchange rate fluctuations other than postponing the payment due on November 15th. Therefore, it deeply regrets the U.S.'s decision to collect the debt. It further declared that Britain firmly believes that resuming war debt payments would inevitably lead to economic disasters; therefore, the current payment must not be regarded as a return to normal debt repayment.</p>
<h3 id="e58">U.S. Reply Rejects British Conditions for Payment <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>▲ Washington, 11th (Havas) – The U.S. response, after being reviewed by Hoover over the phone, was delivered to British Ambassador Sir Ronald Lindsay. The reply noted that the U.S. government was willing to put on record the British government's decision to pay the installment due on December 15th. However, regarding the reservations in the British note, the reply stated: "The U.S. Treasury Secretary cannot accept payment except according to the conditions contained in the agreement for settling war debts." It also stated, "Only the U.S. Congress has the power to change the obligations assumed by each government." The reply further stated that the U.S. State Department considered that "the measures the British government intends to propose after a comprehensive study of the war debt issue in the future, as mentioned in the fifth and sixth paragraphs of its note, are merely an opinion." Regarding this point, the reply reiterated the U.S. note of December 8th, stating that President Hoover was prepared to study the entire war debt issue and propose various plans to stabilize exchange rates, restore commerce, and raise prices. However, the reply declared that the U.S. government and people attached great importance to maintaining the current war debt agreement; therefore, the U.S. rejected Britain's reservation regarding the December 15th war debt installment. Although very polite, it firmly opposed it. The drafting of the U.S. reply was extremely swift; the State Department delivered the reply to the British Ambassador six hours after receiving the British note. According to observations from well-informed sources, the reiteration of the current war debt agreement in the reply was a method used by the U.S. government to avoid attacks from within the country. It is well known that the U.S. government actually wanted to agree with Britain's statement, but it is also a fact that the U.S. Congress has supreme power over this matter. The U.S. State Department believes that the French note will also contain a statement similar to the British note, and the U.S. reply will be the same as the reply to Britain.</p>
<h3 id="e59">France's Attitude Consistent with Britain; Herriot Explains War Debt Case to Parliament <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>▲ Paris, 10th (Reuters) – The French cabinet decided to pay the U.S. debt installment due on December 15th, but with reservations, to act in concert with Britain. The Finance Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies also advocated payment. Therefore, the debate in Parliament tomorrow is no longer of concern to the public. However, everything still depends on the nature of the reservations. Currently, the right-wing party is entirely against payment, the central party's attitude is unclear, the Radical Party mostly advocates payment, and the Socialist Party, which holds the overall view, is very indifferent. If Herriot treats this as a matter of confidence, then the fate of the cabinet may depend on the number of votes in favor or against. If he does not treat this as a matter of confidence, then the chance of parliamentarians supporting payment, even with reservations, will decrease.</p>
<p>▲ Paris, 11th (Havas) – Unless something unexpected happens, the Chamber of Deputies will discuss the war debt issue on Monday according to the following procedure: Premier Herriot will take the stage at 3 p.m. to deliver a declaration in the name of the government, providing a comprehensive explanation of the war debt issue, and report to the Chamber of Deputies the reasons for the government's decision regarding the debt installment due on the 15th of this month. Normally, after a cabinet declaration, parliamentarians would immediately stand up to respond. This time, only one person will be allowed to respond after Herriot's speech. Subsequently, the government will request the parliament to immediately discuss the war debt case. At this point, the speaker will announce a recess for at least one hour to allow the government's proposal to be posted. If there are draft laws, amendments from various committees, or counter-proposals, they will be posted at the same time as the government proposal. During the recess, the Foreign Affairs and Finance Committees will discuss the government proposal. If there are any doubts that Premier Herriot needs to explain, the Premier can also attend and respond. After the committees' discussion, the formal large-scale debate on various proposals in the Chamber of Deputies will begin. The registered parliamentarians will raise questions to the government. The full text of the cabinet proposal will only be finalized tomorrow. In short, regardless of the procedures, the cabinet will submit a draft law to the Chamber of Deputies requesting the disbursement of funds to repay the $96,000,000 due on the war debt. If this case is approved by the Chamber of Deputies, the government will then attend the Senate to explain everything.</p>

<p>Germany still reserves the freedom to withdraw</p>
<p>Five-Power Declaration delivered to the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Key members to meet soon in Geneva</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 11th (Reuters) – The German people regard the German arms equality plan set in Geneva as a great victory for German disarmament policy. There were frequent telephone calls between Berlin and Geneva last night and this morning. German Foreign Minister Neurath spoke with German Chancellor Schleicher several times for a considerable amount of time. Schleicher then went to meet President Hindenburg. Afterwards, he instructed the Foreign Minister to formally sign the agreement. German officials believe that this plan is equivalent to stipulating that all provisions of Chapter 5 of the Treaty of Versailles, if they can be equally applied to all countries participating in the Disarmament Conference, are effective. Germany also believes that if the principle of equality is denied in the details, Germany still has the freedom to withdraw from the Disarmament Conference. If obstacles arise in the implementation of this principle in the future, Germany can be in a dominant position, because it can point out to the world that this agreement is not being observed.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 11th (Reuters) – The declaration signed by British Prime Minister MacDonald, U.S. Representative Norman Davis, French Representative Paul-Boncour, German Foreign Minister Neurath, and Italian Representative Aloisi, granting Germany equal rights to participate in the Disarmament Conference, has been delivered to the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, today. The declaration contains the intention to include various restrictions on the arms of all countries in the future Disarmament Convention, and clarifies that the implementation of these equal rights will be discussed at the conference. The principle of equality must be included in the Disarmament Convention.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 11th (Reuters) – British Prime Minister MacDonald is departing for London tonight. Although he feels tired, he will still stop in Paris for several hours. Key members of the Disarmament Conference are scheduled to meet within this week, but the Disarmament Conference will be postponed until January. The new step being planned is for the Five Powers to meet in London on January 15th. The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, will also attend this and subsequent Five-Power meetings. U.S. Representative Norman Davis is scheduled to depart for New York on Tuesday. His plan to include various measures already agreed upon by the Disarmament Conference in a convention will likely be discussed at the London meeting in January. British Foreign Secretary Simon will remain in Geneva until the end of this week due to the Sino-Japanese incident. There is reason to believe that the work of the Special Committee of Nineteen cannot proceed smoothly, and the explicit topic of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" will soon be brought up for discussion.</p>

Finance Minister Takahashi visited Prime Minister Saito at 10 a.m. this morning to convey the Seiyukai's intentions.

<p>Destroying Our Agencies and Civilian Homes While Falsely Accusing Us of Firing First</p>
<p>Rumors Spread of Simultaneous Uprisings in Tianjin, Peiping, and Yuguan on the 15th</p>
<p>Intended to Support Japanese Army's Attack on Rehe, But We Are Fully Prepared</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondent – The Japanese army is pressing the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army with seven divisions of troops. General Su Bingwen fought bitterly at Haiman for two months, annihilating more than 20,000 Japanese rebels. Later, due to limited ammunition reserves and no way to replenish them, he reluctantly and tearfully announced on the 4th of this month that he was retreating into Russian territory. Now that the military situation in Northern Manchuria has come to an end, the Japanese army is shifting its aggressive gaze to Rehe. Their plan is to station one division on the Haiman line, one division on the Harbin-Changchun line, and one division to suppress the Volunteer Army of Ding Chao and Li Du. The remaining four divisions, after a short rest and replenishment, will take the South Manchuria Railway and enter the puppet Fengshan Road, stationing troops in Jinzhou, Yixian, Zhangwu, and Tongliao, and attacking Rehe in three routes. Another route will seize Shanhaiguan. This is the first step in their military plan. Once Rehe and Yuguan are captured, they will advance towards Peiping and Tianjin. This is the second step. Once Peiping and Tianjin are captured, they will advance along the Peiping-Hankou, Peiping-Suiyuan, and Tianjin-Pukou Railways, and move the puppet regime into the old capital. This is the third step. However, Rehe is covered with mountains and difficult to attack. Tanks are useless, and artillery and aircraft are not very effective. Therefore, the Japanese had long planned to use political means to acquire Rehe. Unexpectedly, Tang Yulin's attitude was unpredictable. So they changed their methods and spent huge sums of money to buy out traitors, who sneaked into the border of Rehe, propagated resistance against Japan and expulsion of Tang, guided the armed masses, and organized a puppet self-defense force. Originally, the folk customs of Rehe were simple and honest, and they had suffered too much from the pain of harsh government in recent years. As long as someone led the expulsion of Tang, they would follow like the wind, without considering that they were working for the Japanese.</p>
<p>In view of the above, Rehe, Peiping, Tianjin, and Yuguan have entered a troubled autumn. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, the Japanese army sent armored trains from Suizhong to make provocative moves outside Shanhaiguan. The Japanese garrison stationed in Yuguan also sent out armed sentries to move around, and the situation was extremely tense. At 10 p.m., the Japanese armored train fired more than a dozen shells into the city at the east entrance of Shanhaiguan Railway Station. He Guozhu, commander of our 9th Brigade, immediately sent personnel to negotiate, but to no avail. The armored train even rushed into the pass and fired 20 to 30 shells between Qinhuangdao and Shihezi, destroying the railway station's water pump (i.e., the water tower on the locomotives) and injuring a guard. At 11 p.m., it returned to Shanhaiguan, hooked our army's telecommunications train to the armored train, dragged it out of the pass, dismantled our radio station equipment, and transported it away. At this time, the military's morale was indignant and the public's morale was panic-stricken. Commander He immediately reported to Zhang Xueliang via long-distance telephone and asked for instructions. Zhang immediately ordered "peaceful handling, no rash action." He immediately followed the instructions and strictly instructed his subordinates to remain calm. Therefore, the sub-customs of Qinhuangdao Customs, established in Yuguan, was attacked by thugs directed by Japanese soldiers, who robbed the tax money and the Japanese goods detained for tax evasion. At the same time, they used hand grenades to attack the Public Security Bureau and robbed the bayonets and firearms. At 2 a.m. on the 9th, the armored train rushed into the pass again and traveled between Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan, blocking the tracks with obstacles. Therefore, the eastbound trains on the Beining Railway only reached Qinhuangdao. After repeated negotiations with the Railway Bureau, and since many refugees had gathered at Yuguan Railway Station and had to be transported, the Japanese army finally agreed to remove the obstacles. The Railway Bureau prepared more than a dozen third-class carriages to transport refugees to Qinhuangdao, who then took trains west. Commander He, accompanied by Public Security Bureau Chief Mao, went to the headquarters of the Japanese garrison in the morning of the 9th to negotiate. Unexpectedly, the commander, Wakaho, took out a written document stating that Chinese troops had first fired at the Japanese armored train, and the Japanese army had returned fire in self-defense, etc., and forced He to sign it. At this time, the armored train fired six or seven more shells as a demonstration. He refused to sign because it violated the facts. Wakaho knew that he could not force him, so he changed his tune and said that he would reinvestigate and talk again at 3 p.m. At the appointed time, Commander He went to the Japanese garrison, but Wakaho said that according to the investigation report, there were many Volunteer Army troops hidden inside and outside Yuguan City, and there was gunfire in the city last night, so they fired shells. However, he did not admit to towing away our army's telecommunications train, dismantling the radio station, robbing our customs, and attacking our Public Security Bureau, resulting in no results. After the incident, an investigation revealed that three shells fell on the sub-customs, injuring three customs officers. One shell fell in front of the county education bureau, shattering the mounting stone in front of the door. Two shells fell in the 9th Brigade headquarters and the Public Security Bureau, but did not explode. One shell fell on each of the following: Juhua Hall, Juhua Inn, Qianfuxin Pharmacy, Fan's small shop, Zhao's bun shop, He's residence on North Street, and the 5th Elementary School, all of which exploded and destroyed the houses. One shell fell on Wang's vegetable garden at Jiaolouwan, but did not explode. Two shells fell on the empty land west of Shuixi, one shell fell on Wang's tomb, two shells fell on the Xiaolingguan Temple, and one shell fell on the west entrance of Shuncheng Street. The total number of shells was 23. There were still 20 to 30 other shells that had not yet been found. The people of Yuguan had all dug cellars, and when they heard the sound of shelling, they fled into the cellars, so there were no casualties. Also, at 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. on the 9th, a Japanese aircraft flew from Qian'an to Yuguan for low-altitude reconnaissance. The east and south gates of Lin'yu County were tightly closed, while the north and west gates were open. The city market was in a state of semi-shutdown, fully demonstrating a bleak and terrifying scene. All schools were closed and the students scattered. The Japanese army dug trenches at Nadaotai's tomb, more than ten miles east of the east gate. Commander He also deployed defensive works at Erlidianzi, two miles outside the east gate, and transferred the 665th Regiment from the county to reinforce the defense. According to Shanhaiguan long-distance telephone reports, although last night (9th) passed peacefully, the Japanese armored train did not retreat, and the Japanese aircraft came again this morning, causing unrest and mass evacuation. The Japanese army is building a large airfield at Xujiawopu, east of the Nanling station on the Jin-Chao branch line, forcing 3,000 to 4,000 laborers to work hard, and building a highway from Beipiao through Nanling to Rehe.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Nakamura Kotaro, commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, sent Staff Officer Miura to Yuguan yesterday (9th) noon to exchange military opinions. He also sent more than 300 artillerymen to Yuguan to prepare for battle, and dispatched the destroyer Asagao from Dalian to Tianjin to await orders. Japanese Consul Sangishima in Tianjin visited Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong at 2 p.m. yesterday, stating that the Chinese troops in Yuguan were provoking the Japanese army and requesting that they be stopped immediately. The Japanese embassy in Peiping also made similar protests to Zhang Xueliang. Yu Xuezhong sent personnel to Yuguan last night to investigate everything. It is now rumored that the Japanese army will launch an attack in Peiping, Tianjin, and Yuguan on the 15th of this month to support the Japanese army's attack on Rehe. According to our authorities, this information may be a bluff and may not be reliable, but our side is adequately prepared. If they really come to make trouble, we have a responsibility to defend our territory and will not give up. The power of the Japanese army lies in tanks and aircraft. If there is street fighting, both sides are equal. Therefore, this time our side has not prepared sandbags and electric fences, because in street fighting, if soldiers hide behind electric fences and sandbags, they will not want to move forward. If there are no electric fences and sandbags to rely on, they must quickly move forward and fight when they see the enemy attacking. Our northern warriors must at least make the Japanese army have a proper understanding. (December 10th)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondent – The National Music Concert of the Datong Music Association was held at the People's Cinema at 4 p.m. today (10th). More than 400 people attended. It opened on time. The first thing that entered the audience's ears and eyes was the "National Music Suite, Chapter 3" played by all the members of the association. Then Wang Bingnan performed a solo on the ancient se "Shouyang Palace". The sound was melodious and the entire audience was silent. Before long, the sound subsided and the curtain fell. After a brief arrangement, Tian Yinghui's ancient qin solo appeared. The name of the song was "Drunken Fisherman Singing in the Evening", playing leisurely, intermittently, as if a drunken fisherman were beating his boat on the Jiangtan beach and singing folk songs. Then, as applause sounded, Yang Shao Yi's pipa solo "Spring River Flower Moon Night" began to play, sometimes tight, sometimes relaxed, like a complaint, like a plea, melodious and pleasant. Following Yang was Wang Dianyu's silk string performance. The program was "Weaving Room Teaching Son", with vivid imitations of trumpets, sheng pipes, military bands, etc., leaving the listeners amazed. Next was the "Guo Jie Lou" ensemble by the Jinpu Railway National Music Troupe. More than a dozen people participated, the sound stopping the clouds, and the aftersound circling the beams, making the atmosphere in the hall tense. Soon, Li Huaxuan's erhu solo "Liu Qing Niang" appeared, performing a song in which he changed his tune seven times, the sound of the oriole was clear and pleasant, and graceful and pleasing. Next was Yang Sheng Yi and Wang Bingnan's duet on pipa and other instruments, "Moon High". Song Binglan, a female, sang the Kunqu opera "Bu Bu Jiao" and "Ma Zai Bo". Fu Jingyuan's erhu solo "Autumn Wind Falling Leaves" was desolate and sad, touching the audience. The finale was the entire ensemble of "Qiu Ying Qu". It ended at six o'clock. (December 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Mengcheng Drug Manufacturing Case Transferred to Court <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zaigong has been escorted to the Fengyang High Court</p>
<p>Another Drug Manufacturing Facility Discovered in Guoyang</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondent – After Chen Zaigong, the main criminal in the Mengcheng heroin manufacturing case in northern Anhui, was captured and escorted to Bengbu, the principal offender, Li Mingxun, and more than 20 accomplices, including Yu Yiting, Li Xiuqing, and Wang Ziqing, all fled upon hearing the news, and the drug manufacturing equipment was also secretly hidden. Thousands of taels of opium dross from the drug extraction have been dumped into the pond, poisoning countless fish of all sizes, which can be described as harming innocent bystanders. The various public organizations in Mengcheng believed that the case was of great importance and feared that they would be implicated. After Chen Zaigong was arrested, they jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting that Chen Zaigong be transferred to the court for handling in order to avoid being tried by military law in Bengbu. Therefore, Chen Zaigong was only interrogated twice at the Bengbu Garrison Headquarters, but Chen consistently denied participating in the manufacture of drugs. On the 9th, Commander Xu Tingyao suddenly received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, ordering Chen Zaigong to be transferred to the Fengyang Court for handling. In the afternoon at 1 p.m., he sent a clerk from the military law office and four armed soldiers to take Chen from the detention center, along with 49 documents related to the case, and escort them to the First Branch of the Anhui Higher Court in Fengyang for legal processing. Upon hearing this news, Wang Jianhu and Zhang Zhendong, the Mengcheng Party and Education representatives who reported the drug manufacturing case, urgently telegraphed Chairman Chiang in Hankou that night, requesting that Chen Zaigong be ordered to be escorted back to Bengbu and handed over to the garrison headquarters for handling, but it is unknown whether this will be effective. While the Mengcheng heroin case, which caused a sensation for a time, has not yet been fully resolved, Guoyang has again heard of the cracking of a heroin manufacturing case. It can be imagined that drugs are spreading in northern Anhui. A few days ago, County Magistrate Xu of Guoyang led a team on patrol and learned that a drug manufacturing facility had been set up in Huangzhuang, a northern township of the county. He immediately led the Third Squadron of the Public Security Bureau to investigate and, sure enough, discovered it on the spot, seizing more than 200 taels of heroin, a large batch of opium, a drug manufacturing machine, and more than 20 barrels of gasoline, and arresting six criminals involved in manufacturing drugs: Wang Hanqing, Lu Zhongyang, Li Wen, Jin Yunlu, He Chungao, and Yang Ru, and escorting them to the county. Xu immediately interrogated them personally, and the criminals confessed to manufacturing drugs without reservation. Xu immediately telegraphed the province for instructions, and the provincial government replied, ordering that the criminals be sentenced to three or five years of imprisonment and fined between one and ten thousand yuan. Xu has complied with the telegram. Mengcheng and Guoyang counties are adjacent, and the manufacturing of drugs is well known in the vicinity. With these successive crackdowns, the drug atmosphere in northern Anhui may be slightly curbed. (December 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Jiangsu Province Land Deed Tax Reduced for One Month <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>From the 20th of this month to the 20th of February</p>
<p>During this period, both the basic and surtaxes will be collected at half price</p>
<p>On the 9th of this month, the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee passed the Finance Department's proposal at its 550th meeting: The land deed tax in this province has not been actively paid due to the low grain prices and economic depression this year. From the 20th of this December to the 20th of next January, it will be collected at half of the original tax rate. During this one-month price reduction period, the original surtaxes and capital donations will also be collected at half price uniformly, and the stipulated overdue penalties will also be waived to reduce the burden on the people. The original proposal of the Finance Department is recorded as follows: "The land deed tax in this province is designated as the construction public bond fund. Currently, due to the low grain prices and economic depression this year, the land deed tax in various counties has not been actively paid, and the fifth issuance period is approaching. It is estimated that the fund for principal and interest repayment is very far short, and we must quickly find relief methods. The land deed tax rate was originally set at nine and six for sales and mortgages. To promote the vigorous collection of land deed tax, it is necessary to have a special price reduction to attract business. It is proposed that from the 20th of this December to the 20th of January, we will collect half of the original tax rate for one month. During this one-month price reduction period, the original surtaxes and capital donations will also be collected at half price uniformly, and the stipulated overdue penalties will also be waived to reduce the burden on the people and promote the vigorous collection of land deed tax. Is this appropriate for the sake of consolidating the credit of the public bond fund? Please decide publicly."</p>

If the fine is not paid, two yuan will be offset against one day of imprisonment, commuted to detention, for a term not exceeding one year. He is acquitted of the remaining charges." After the sentence was announced, Judge Hu instructed Hu Lifu in court, saying, "Your crimes have been judged today. You have been convicted of four crimes. If you disagree, you can appeal within ten days from the date of delivery of the judgment." Hu replied, "Of course, I will appeal," and then left the court. (12th)</p>

<p>The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, upon</p>
<p>seeing the report that the Jiangsu Provincial Government meeting decided to abolish the Department of Industry, believes that the Department of Industry is related to the people's livelihood, and that Director He has been in Jiangsu for many years, is familiar with the people's conditions. Formerly in charge of agriculture and mining, he now comprehensively oversees industry, with obvious achievements and widely respected reputation. The Jiangsu Provincial Government's sudden abolition of the Department of Industry is tantamount to indicating to the people of Jiangsu that all industries can be abandoned. Therefore, yesterday (the 12th), separate telegrams were sent to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting correction and prompt cancellation of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's proposed abolition of the Department of Industry to avoid confusion and to emphasize industry.</p>

<p>Tan Xihong, Director of the Ministry of Industry's Forestry and Land Reclamation Department, recently noted that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry has been ordered to be abolished. However, due to the importance of the projects managed by the department, such as sericulture and food, it is necessary to conduct an investigation. Therefore, he took a train from Nanjing to Wuxi the night before last. The next day, he went to the Huaxin and Minfeng silk factories outside the South Gate for inspection. Yesterday, silk industry leaders Qian Fenghao and others hosted a banquet and invited County Magistrate Chen Fude, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yang Hanxi, and Municipal Asset Director Qian Sunqing to attend. During the banquet, Director Tan discussed detailed plans for the future development of the silk industry, the relief of the current crisis, the relief of rural bankruptcy, and the increase in food prices. Director Tan also told reporters that his tasks in Wuxi are: 1. To relieve farmers. At a time when rice prices are plummeting, the ancient saying goes, "Cheap grain hurts farmers." If the government does not take measures, next year rice prices will rise, and it will be monopolized by unscrupulous merchants. Those who benefit will probably still be merchants, not farmers. However, the government's power is only enough to increase the import tax rate on foreign rice and privately ban the transport of rice. 2. To unify silkworm breeds and expand the model area for sericulture. Jiangsu is a sericulture region. The former Director of the Department of Industry had already proposed unifying silkworm breeds, which will be implemented next year. The Ministry intends to review and approve after inspection. Jintan County in Jiangsu Province has already been designated as a model area for sericulture. Now, counties with inferior goods will be selected for improvement, and new knowledge of silkworm rearing will be imparted, so that they can become the second model area.</p>

<p>Zhao Sun, a widow in Xiaozhi Village, Xinlian Township, Wuyi Fourteenth District, had her four-month-old posthumous orphan kidnapped from its sleeping tub by several bandits on the night of the 29th of last month. Afterwards, the bandits sent three letters in a row, demanding a ransom of three thousand yuan, requiring someone to hold three straw sandals and go to Xiaoche Huangshan to negotiate, otherwise Zhao Sun's house would be destroyed, etc. After this case occurred, several days had passed. After the victim and the township head reported the case to the county government, County Magistrate Zhang immediately ordered Detective Team Leader Ni Gusheng to strictly arrest them. Upon receiving the order, Captain Ni sent detectives to Xinzha Town on the afternoon of the 11th and arrested the kidnappers Xu Guanghuo and Chen Panhai. However, the hostage has not yet been found.

<p>A Hong Porcelain boat in Zhapu sailed out to sea the day before yesterday and suddenly saw a pirate ship approaching. The boat deliberately dodged east and west, but the pirate ship kept chasing it, so it repeatedly fled into the estuary, hurriedly landed, reported to the fishing protection team, and transferred the information to the Public Security Bureau, the Tax Police Team, and the Security Corps. However, the pirate ship had already chased and sailed into the entrance. All the teams rushed to the seawall to guard it. As expected, the pirate ship sailed in with its sails raised, and they fired guns and shouted to stop it, firing more than twenty shots in total. At the same time, the city announced temporary martial law. Seeing bullets raining down, the sailing boat hung a mast light, obeyed the order to drop anchor, and sent a representative on a small boat, claiming to be a hemp skin boat from Shaoxing, which had also encountered pirates in the middle of the journey but had escaped by speeding up. The Public Security Bureau then telegraphed the Shaoxing Customs Brokerage, which replied that it was indeed a law-abiding merchant, and the sailing boat was released on bail yesterday.</p>

<p>Futi is located in the northwest of Anhui, bordering Henan to the west, and has always been an area where bandits emerge. The area has been severely affected by banditry for many years. Although government troops and local militias have made efforts to suppress them, they have not been able to completely eliminate them. Recently, with the approach of winter and the end of the year, many hungry people have taken risks and joined the bandits, gathering at night, and gradually forming bandit gangs. The bandit leaders Zhao Hongshan, Zhang Siyan, Yang Xiaoheizi, and others, with more than 400 bandits, have recently gathered in the Li Gang Bridge area, more than 20 li from the Zhaiji, in the tenth district of Futi, entrenched and harassing, only 180 li from the county seat. They are burning, killing, raping, and looting, and the situation is extremely rampant. Residents are fleeing. In recent days, they have gathered more and more, and their momentum has become increasingly large. They have also fled to the Guan Yuemiao Zhangjiawa area on the border of Anhui and Henan. The county government of the neighboring county has telegraphed the Fourth Division Commander Xu Tingyao, stationed in Bengbu, to send troops to suppress them.</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Beginning and End of the Chengdu Street Fighting <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Origin of the Sichuan War – The Special Situation of Chengdu</p>
<p>The Course of the Street Fighting – The Human Hell After the War</p>
<p>This Sichuan war is like a sore on a person's body, which has been accumulating for five or six years, and it cannot but fester. Sichuan Province has a large area, many mountains, and inconvenient transportation, so it is easy to produce feudal warlords. Since Yang Sen's defeat, four big bosses have remained: one in Chongqing, commonly known as Yu Liu (i.e., Liu Xiang), the commander of the Twenty-first Army; and three in Chengdu: one is Liu Wenhui, the commander of the Twenty-fourth Army, who is also the chairman of the provincial government, commonly known as Provincial Liu; one is Deng Xihou, the commander of the Twenty-eighth Army; and one is Tian Songyao, the commander of the Twenty-ninth Army, collectively known as the Deng Tian Liu Three Army Commanders.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Second Liu's forces are the largest. One occupies Chongqing, controlling more than 20 counties in eastern Sichuan, with its military strength extending to Shashi in Hubei, and its tax revenue is extremely strong. The other occupies Chengdu, with its subordinate counties accounting for half of Sichuan (more than 70 counties), and rich areas such as Yongchuan, Neijiang, Zizhong, and Ziyang are all within it, and its tax revenue is also good. The former (Liu Xiang) holds the title of Director-General of Sichuan Rehabilitation and has extraordinary ambitions, with the idea of unifying Sichuan and becoming the leader of the Southwest, so he spares no effort in preparing his troops and horses. Now, the Sichuan River has his warships, and Yuxian has his airfield. He is the commander of the army, navy, and air force, and his power is more and more oppressive. Provincial Liu inevitably has many things that he cannot get away with. The most obvious is the withholding of all military supplies he purchased downstream, and after a long time, even the medical supplies are withheld. Provincial Liu did not hesitate to condescend and personally went to Chongqing to negotiate. Not only did Yu Liu refuse to return them, but also delayed and detained him for more than a month. After Provincial Liu returned to Chengdu, the kind of anger can be imagined. Yu Liu, feeling that the position of Southwest leader cannot be achieved through negotiation, also actively prepared for war, and also had a backstage and inside support (Tian Songyao), so his determination became more and more firm. In early October, he began his military operations.</p>
<p>Provincial Liu knew that the situation was not good, so he sang the theory of classmate cooperation, and at the same time showed leniency to Deng Tian, dividing three counties to Deng and three counties to Tian. However, Tian had an understanding with Liu Xiang long ago and stood on the same front (the Allied Army). On October 6, Tian's army first opened fire on Provincial Liu in Chengdu. Liu initially refused to fight back, but still did not reverse Tian's army commander's heart, taking advantage of the Allied Army's victories in the front line and Provincial Liu's concessions to think that by coercion, it would not be difficult for Provincial Liu to submit, and the whole army withdrew from the city, sitting back and profiting from the situation. So he repeatedly made provocations, but Provincial Liu firmly held the determination to survive with the city or perish with the city, and was not moved in the slightest. The Chengdu street fighting was inevitable and opened on November 15 at 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Chengdu's special situation is not only unique in the country, but also in the world.</p>
<p>The circumference of Chengdu City is about 28 li. Most of the city walls are still intact. Historically, it is divided into the Main City and the Minor City. The Main City is Chengdu, and the Minor City was originally the Manchu City. The Main City occupies about two-thirds of the east. The area inside the East Gate (East Street Chunxi Road) is the location of industry and commerce. The roads are wide, the electric lights shine at night, and the pedestrians are crowded. The Xisi Archway in Beiping is not as good as two or three of them. The Minor City is like the commercial port of Shenyang, where the residences of the general dignitaries are located, and there is no industry and commerce. This is nothing special.</p>
<p>Its special feature is in the administrative organization, which is slightly revealed. One city is the territory of two counties. The southeast part is the territory of Huayang, with the Huayang County Government. The northwest part is the territory of Chengdu County, with the Chengdu County Government. Above the two county governments, there is also a Municipal Government. Above the Municipal Government, there is also a Provincial Government. The Provincial Government also has three Military Governments (Three Army Headquarters). The Three Military Governments can be said to be the Supreme Government.</p>
<p>In terms of public security, its special feature is relatively clear. Each street has its own Regiment Affairs Office, funded by the residents of each street, raising a few old, weak, and opium-faced soldiers to maintain the public security of the street. Above this, there are also the police of the Municipal Government. Above the police, there are also the military police of the Provincial City Military Police Joint Office. Further up, there are soldiers directly dispatched by the military headquarters of various armies. These soldiers can also be said to be the Supreme Soldiers.</p>
<p>The most special thing is in the military defense zone. One city is divided into three defense zones. Generally speaking, before the war, the Twenty-fourth Army occupied the area inside the South Gate and the area inside the East Gate. The Twenty-eighth Army occupied the area inside the North Gate and the area inside the West Gate. The rest was the defense zone of the Twenty-ninth Army. Looking at it in more detail, there may still be the defense area of the Twenty-ninth Army within the defense area of the Twenty-fourth Army. It is intricate and difficult to investigate. The defense zones of various armies are absolutely like independent countries. The internal administrative personnel, such as the county government personnel, are appointed by the military headquarters and listen to the command of the military headquarters. The internal tax revenue is collected by the military headquarters. The internal public security is managed by the military headquarters. The police and the military police of the Military Police Joint Office are nothing more than deaf ears. The police can be said to be the most pitiful in the country. They don't even have socks on their feet. They wear light yellow military uniforms and hold a mourning stick. They don't even dare to stand on the street. They secretly hide in the shops. If a murder occurs, the murderer runs from this military district to that military district, and nothing happens. Even murders and robberies in broad daylight are not investigated. The people are really the straw dogs of the warlords, and their lives and property have no guarantee at all.</p>
<p>Under such a situation, Provincial Liu is naturally uneasy, and Deng Tian has also felt forced in recent years, and there is no way to live in peace for a long time, so war is inevitable.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>The Chengdu street fighting, from the afternoon of November 15 to the morning of November 24, was the most intense in the first two days, fighting for 24 hours at a stretch, without stopping for a moment. Cannons, machine guns, and grenades were used simultaneously, rumbling in the ears. Thinking of the lost land and the representatives of the League of Nations, I couldn't help but shed tears. The focus of the two armies' operations was initially in two places: (1) the headquarters of the Twenty-fourth Army; (2) the Imperial City; and later the arsenal outside the East Gate was added.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Twenty-fourth Army, i.e., the former Governor-General's Office, is located at the junction of the Minor City and the Main City. Not far to its north is the defense zone of the Twenty-ninth Army. The mansion of its师长(Division Commander) Zeng Nanfu is on Kuixinglou Street, very close to the headquarters. The front, back, left, and right fire lines are the densest here. The streets and alleys are full of piles of stone slabs, like a wall.</p>
<p>The Imperial City, according to folklore, is the遗城(remnant city) of Liu Houzhu. It was still intact at the end of the Qing Dynasty. After more than a month of bombing in the second year of the Republic of China, only a South Gate, a North Gate, and a large mound of earth, known as Coal Mountain, remain. From the South Gate to the North Gate are all schools. On both sides of the South Gate are two middle schools, in the middle is the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Education of Sichuan University, and behind it are the affiliated primary school, Minxin Middle School, and the male department of the Art School.</p>
<p>The Imperial City has a very high terrain. Standing on Coal Mountain or the city gate, you can overlook the entire city, so it is a strategically important place. The arsenal, outside the East Gate, is the source of life for the Twenty-ninth Army. It is said that there are usually more than 2,000 people working inside, and guns and bullets can be manufactured.</p>
<p>The next important place is Shaanxi Street, not far from the Imperial City, where the Liu Mansion is located.</p>
<p>Except for the first two days, most of the rest were resting during the day and firing at night. The reporter lived in the Law School of the South Campus inside the South Gate and was always very safe.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>According to the announcement issued on the 24th, the Twenty-ninth Army accepted Deng Xihou's mediation, allowed the troops to withdraw from the city, and said that order had now been restored. However, it was difficult to pass through everywhere. It was not until yesterday (the 25th) afternoon that I was able to travel around everywhere. The headquarters of the Twenty-fourth Army did not suffer major losses. It is a pity that the surrounding civilian houses, Sichuan University in the Imperial City, and the two middle schools in front have not suffered any losses. The most severely damaged were the affiliated primary school, Minxin Middle School, and the Art School, most of which were burned. Those that were not burned were full of gun holes, broken walls, and it was so sad. Further back (out of the door), the Yuxi Bian Street was even more miserably fought. This street is where the small businesses and rickshaw pullers are located. It has already been unspeakable suffering on weekdays. Now the nests are pierced through the sky, and the objects have disappeared. How can they live? Some children are crying with hunger and cold, and their mothers are shedding clear tears and sighing up to the sky. Some are three-inch wooden coffins lying in front of the door, their wives are heartbroken and crying, not knowing what to say. Some are Taoists chanting sutras with a clanging sound, sending off this secluded soul. Some mothers have died and their fathers are still alive, leaving a group of orphans. Some are circling around the room, crying and weeping. Some are staring straight with both eyes, as if waking up from a Nanke dream, adding the opium addicts still lying in the open air and eating opium, adding the hairy toilets with fecal smells filling the nose. The eighteenth layer of hell is probably nothing more than this.</p>
<p>But there is something even more heartbreaking, and that is at the east end of Yuxi Bian Street, a woman crying with snot, tears, and saliva, crying to the death. Her husband died early. Her only hope was her six-year-old beloved son (who was shot to death. Her only pig, which she had worked so hard to raise, was also slaughtered and eaten by the army. Now the four walls are empty. This is at No. 196 Dongyu Hebei Street, (next to the Imperial City), in a very beautiful foreign-style house, a total of six coffins are parked. An old woman is crying with her head in her arms. From her crying, I heard that one [Blank] is a good husband, two are her sons, and two are her daughters: The world is sad for it, who will avenge the wronged souls:</p>
<p>But: Strange, there is really nothing strange about it. It is said that the two army commanders Tian and Liu are cooperating again. During the street fighting, the call for this cooperation was also discovered twice, and the two army commanders also crossed over:</p>
<p>It is also said that Tian Songyao is still connected with Yu Liu and is now temporarily withdrawing from the city, waiting for the Allied forces to approach Chengdu before making a comeback.</p>
<p>In the end, we don't know what stage it will reach. Even the authorities don't know. What we can know, and the authorities themselves also know, is "everything is shifted according to individual status."</p>
<p>The streets are plastered with slogans such as "Down with Tian Songyao" because he (1) violates public opinion, (2) destroys peace, (3) provokes the Sichuan war, (4) colludes with Liu Xiang, etc. Before the ink was dry, the notice protecting the residences of the officers of the Twenty-ninth Army was brilliantly revealed.</p>
<p>The generals of the Twenty-eighth Army and the generals of the Twenty-ninth Army telegraphed to advise the generals of the Twenty-fourth Army to abandon the dark and turn to the light, saying, "Don't be personal running dogs, be the army of the country." How firm it is, how passionate it is. But in the blink of an eye, the generals of the Twenty-eighth Army sang neutrality again. Army Commander Deng is once again running for peace with the aim of compassion: (November 26 in Chengdu)</p>

<p>He Yingqin and Others Left Last Night</p>
<p>Sun Ke and Others Have Not Decided on a Date</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter visited Central Committee Member Sun Zhesheng at his private residence yesterday to inquire about when he would go to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee. According to him, the Third Plenary Session is of great importance to the country's future, so he has decided to go to Beijing to attend and jointly discuss national affairs. It has been decided that he will go to Beijing within the next two or three days. Most of the Central Committee members in Shanghai will go to Beijing to attend. Committee Member Song Qingling does not intend to attend. Regarding the issue of proposals, he has already drafted several proposals, but according to the order recently issued by the Central Committee, all proposals from Central Committee members must be registered by the Secretariat of the Third Plenary Session and officially announced, so he cannot disclose them now. However, the content is based on the national salvation program he had previously drafted. According to the reporter's investigation, Sun originally planned to take the night train to Beijing on the 14th to attend the opening ceremony of the Third Plenary Session on the morning of the 15th. However, due to matters that needed to be delayed, it has now been decided that he will accompany the Central Committee members in Shanghai Wu Chaochu, Zhang Huichang, Ma Chaojun, Chen Ce, Liang Hancao, Fu Rulin, and others on the night express train to Beijing on the 15th. As for Bai Wenwei, Li Liejun, Xiong Kewu, Zhang Zhiben, Yang Shukan, and others, the date of departure has not yet been decided. He Yingqin, Wu Tiecheng, Zeng Zhongming, Zhang Jingjiang, and others have already taken the night train to Beijing last night to attend.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Committee members Guan Su Ren, Deng Qingyang, Guang Xiu, and Li Qia'an have also taken the night train to Beijing last night. According to Guan Su Ren, before his departure, he told reporters that he had a meeting with Mr. Sun Zhesheng and other Shanghai Committee members last night (i.e., the night before last) to discuss the date of going to Beijing and attendance issues. Regarding the date of going to Beijing, it was decided that the committee members would go to Beijing in batches within one or two days. As for the proposals, Mr. Sun Zhesheng has drafted two proposals: one on concentrating national strength to save the crisis, and the other on the implementation of the party and government guidelines. The Shanghai and Guangdong Committee members will jointly sign them and submit them to the plenary session for discussion.</p>

<p>Will Definitely Not Attend the Third Plenary Session</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang Sells His House</p>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Central Committee member Xu Du-bi yesterday and asked him when he would go to Beijing to attend the meeting and about Feng Yuxiang's repeated telegrams of correction. Xu stated the following: I do not intend to go to Beijing to attend the meeting. Since the September 18th National Crisis, anyone with even a little patriotic spirit has been willing to abandon internal and personal prejudices, unite sincerely, and save us from peril. Therefore, at the First Plenary Session in Nanjing in January of this year and the Second Plenary Session in Luoyang in March, I attended with a full heart and a spirit of knowing no bounds in speaking my mind. However, the result was not only useless but also caused many misunderstandings, which I find very painful to think about. This time, when the Third Plenary Session convenes, I should attend, but if I attend without speaking, I would be as silent as a cicada, which would be meaningless. If I speak my mind fully, it will inevitably cause more misunderstandings, not to mention that even if I speak, it may not be effective. Therefore, after careful consideration, I think it would be better not to attend. After Mr. Feng arrived in Zhangjiakou, although</p>
<p>little news has been heard, colleagues and friends who have received letters have said that whenever Mr. Feng moves to a new place, the outside world speculates in various ways, creating illusions out of thin air. For example, when he first moved from Xuzhou to Mount Tai, there were all sorts of rumors. After he lived there for a long time, the rumors subsided. Later, when the war in eastern Shandong broke out, Mr. Feng moved to Zhangjiakou to avoid rumors, but unexpectedly, rumors arose again because of this. Is this oversensitive speculation, or is it malicious slander from someone with ulterior motives, which is exhausting. Mr. Feng is free to live wherever he wants, and if people in society recognize this, rumors will naturally not arise. Furthermore, if Mr. Feng has rumors when he lives in Zhangjiakou, who can guarantee that there will be no rumors if he moves to other places?</p>
<p>Currently, Mr. Feng is in financial difficulty and is planning to sell two houses he bought in previous years, namely the library where he currently lives and Ai Wu Lu. After this matter is settled, he may move elsewhere, which is also possible.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Wage Increase Crisis Among Employees on Two Railways <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Preventing Hangzhou Train from Leaving for Shanghai</p>
<p>Resolved Only After Great Effort</p>
<p>Employees at all stations along the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, due to the issue of wage increases for January and February of this year, repeatedly requested equal treatment for all employees and sent more than 50 representatives from various stations to the head office to petition. They did not receive a concrete and satisfactory result. Yesterday morning around 8 o'clock, workers from the gate station, vehicle section, and engine section in Hangzhou, feeling that the end of the year was approaching and there was still no hope of a concrete solution, gathered dozens of employees from stations such as the gate, Nanxing, and Hangzhou to come to Shanghai to continue their petition, requesting that the vehicle section allocate a special train. The vehicle section did not dare to assign one without authorization, which caused a disturbance. At that time, the thirty-ninth fourth-class passenger train from the gate to Hangzhou was being fitted with the engine to depart, leading a crowd of workers to sit on the tracks at the station to prevent the engine from moving. Later, leaders from the engine and vehicle sections did their best to persuade and comfort them, asking them not to take actions outside the rails, to work peacefully, and to wait quietly for a batch order, as there would be a solution for equal treatment for all. The employees then withdrew from the tracks, and the thirty-ninth slow train for third and fourth-class passengers was able to depart for Shanghai. In addition to being delayed at the station for an hour, the third and fourth-class passenger train arrived at the Shanghai station about two hours late.</p>

<p>▲ Implementation Can Be Approved Once the Attached Schedule Is Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that the silk and satin industry and the electrical silk weaving industry associations stated in their letters that the Vietnamese government was imposing excessive taxes on silk fabrics, making it impossible for Chinese silk to be sold in Vietnam. They telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that it quickly negotiate a new treaty with the French side to maintain China's foreign trade in silk. It is now known that the Chamber received a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday: The presentation is noted. The Sino-French Vietnamese Special Convention has not been approved and implemented for a long time because the attached schedule has not yet been agreed upon. The Ministry is now actively negotiating this attached schedule with the French side. Once it is finalized, the convention can be approved and implemented by both parties. Please be informed of this.

<h3 id="e89">Chen Xinghan, Director of Two Railways Bureaus, Suddenly Resigned Yesterday <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Chen Xinghan, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus, suddenly submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that he had been in a busy and stressful position for a long time, his mind and body were exhausted, and he earnestly requested to resign from the positions of Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, hoping that the Ministry would approve his request so that he could recuperate. He humbly stated that he had been appointed by the Ministry to take over as Director of the Two Railway Bureaus because the Shanghai Incident had just erupted, the country was facing a national crisis, and the Two Railways were in a crucial position, related to the overall strategy of foreign resistance and military affairs, and could not be without a responsible person for a single day. He was motivated by a sense of duty and reluctantly came forward to maintain the situation. Therefore, during the military period, although he experienced many dangers and dealt with difficult situations, he still worked hard to maintain military transportation, so that the front-line combat would not be disrupted due to transportation interruptions, and to rescue railway property, so that more than one hundred locomotives and vehicles left behind in the North Station area would not be used by the enemy. In addition, he rescued refugees, maintained transportation, and protected merchants' goods, doing everything within his power. After the war ceased and negotiations began, he realized that restoring transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was of utmost importance to the country's politics, social economy, and international perception, so he started working on repairs to railway stations and planning train schedules. He worked tirelessly and slept little, and finally restored full line traffic on the day the enemy troops withdrew. At that time, after accumulating fatigue, he originally intended to retire after the task was completed to recuperate. Thinking that although traffic had been restored, construction still needed to be planned and maintained, and that the Shanghai Main Station was the hub of the Two Railways, it was necessary to quickly restore it. Therefore, he forgot his limitations and, based on his daily experience and observations, prepared a report on the restoration of the Shanghai Main Station and submitted it to the Ministry, hoping to contribute to the effort. Fortunately, the Ministry adopted it and convened a Two Railways Construction and Restoration Committee. At the meeting, the general plan was decided and only awaited implementation. Since Chen Xinghan took over the position until now, for several months, he had been loyal in times of crisis and followed regulations in routine matters, never daring to neglect his duties, which had caused him great effort and concern. Now that railway affairs had returned to normal and construction was expected to be completed soon, he humbly submitted this document to explain the situation and earnestly requested that he be allowed to resign and that a capable person be selected to take over as soon as possible to emphasize railway affairs, so that he could rest and recuperate and plan to repay the country in the future. He was overwhelmed with gratitude and awaited orders.</p>

<p>▲ Plans to Stay in Shanghai for Two Weeks Before Going to Beijing</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, French scholar Pellet, a professor at the Collège de France, has been studying Chinese affairs for decades and is known as a China expert. He arrived in Shanghai aboard the French mail steamer Zhen Nusha. This trip followed a visit to Vietnam, where he stayed briefly, postponing his ship by one voyage. It is reported that Pellet is on a mission from the French Ministry of Public Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to his interview with reporters, although his last visit to Vietnam was thirteen years ago, he has maintained close contact with the country since he established the École Française d'Extrême-Orient in Vietnam thirty-three years ago and is familiar with the situation there. Listening to him talk about Vietnam today, even decades ago, feels like yesterday. After landing at Penang on the postal steamer Alami, he traveled through Bangkok, Angor, and then to Jinta City, Sisek, and Hue-Hanoi. Although he traveled in haste, he was able to gain insight into the development of the area by visiting the museum and the archaeological research institute. He has now reached the main goal of his trip by arriving in China. China is a country he deeply loves and has devoted his life to studying its culture. He aims to increase opportunities for contact between scholars of the two countries and to observe China's achievements from a scholarly perspective, thereby enhancing academic cooperation between the two countries. He currently plans to stay in Shanghai for two weeks before going to Beijing for a short stay of two months.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Secretary-General Yu Talks About the Recent Situation of the Municipal Administration <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government spoke to reporters yesterday about various recent situations in the municipal administration, as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Financial Tightening Issue</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the war, the Shanghai Municipal Government's budget for this year has a deficit of more than one million yuan in income and expenditure. In addition, due to the expenses of the security team, the budget has increased by one million yuan, making the treasury even more stretched. Therefore, in order to tighten finances, Director Cai raised the issue at the 222nd municipal meeting. It was decided that I, Director Cai, and Commissioner Xu would work together to find remedial measures. The measures that have now been agreed upon are as follows: 1. Increase revenue. There has always been a division of troops stationed in this city for security, and its expenses have been borne by the central government. This year, due to the need to suppress the communists, the troops were transferred elsewhere, and the local police force felt thin, so the security team was organized. The annual expenses are about one million yuan. At a time when income is short, the municipal government really cannot afford this huge sum. Therefore, it is planned to request the central government to allocate funds separately for the security team's expenses, which will surely be approved by the central government. 2. Reduce expenditure. To make up for the deficit of more than one million yuan, expenditure will be reduced. All bureaus and affiliated institutions should strive to save as much as possible in all areas where savings are possible. All temporary expenses that have been approved by the municipal government but have not been paid should be listed by the Finance Bureau and submitted to the mayor for review, distinguishing between priorities and moderately reducing or delaying them. If the above two measures can be implemented, the municipal treasury deficit may be temporarily made up.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Municipal Bank Expansion Issue <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Bank has not been able to develop fully due to a lack of capital. However, its credit has been established, and there is a slight surplus every year. If it can be actively expanded, its future prospects are unlimited. Mayor Wu, in view of this, has decided to expand the original capital of one million yuan to six million yuan, separately soliciting three million yuan in commercial shares and three million yuan from the municipal government. In addition to the original capital of one million yuan, one million yuan will be disbursed from the Fuxing Public Bonds, and the remaining one million yuan will be transferred from the municipal government's profit-making enterprises.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Municipal Ferry Expansion Issue <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>As for the expansion plan of the municipal ferry, which requires 300,000 yuan, a corresponding method has also been discussed and handed over to the Finance and Land Bureaus for consultation and implementation. Since the municipal ferry was established, its business has been developing and its income has been increasing. In addition to expenses and replenishment, there is a considerable surplus. If the expansion plan is successful, it will not only benefit the transportation of citizens but also generate profits in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Petition Representatives from the Anti-Civil War Association Will Go to Beijing Tonight <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Association Issued a Public Telegram Yesterday</p>
<p>Stating Liu Xiang's Crimes</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the Anti-Civil War League, after deciding at the third meeting of the Standing Committee the day before yesterday to announce non-cooperation with Liu Xiang for violating the orders of the National Government and continuing the civil war, convened a meeting of the daily Standing Committee members at 1:30 pm yesterday to discuss the telegram that should be sent. Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Liu Zhanen (representing Xu Jiqing), Wu Daquan (representing Qian Xinzhi), Yan Esheng, and others attended. After discussing various telegrams, they were sent separately. Furthermore, the representatives to Beijing, Lin Kanghou and Liu Zhanen, are scheduled to take the night train to Beijing at 11:30 tonight, carrying a petition to petition the Third Plenary Session.</p>
<p>The association issued a public telegram yesterday (with title omitted):</p>
<p>For your review. The national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, and we have no time to resist foreign aggression. If anyone has a heart, how can they bear internal strife? Since its establishment, this association has been working hard to achieve the goal of domestic stability and foreign resistance with the united strength of the people. Unexpectedly, in mid-September of this year, this association repeatedly received reports from Sichuanese in Shanghai stating that both Chengdu and Chongqing were making military movements, fearing that misfortune would occur, and requesting that methods be devised to eliminate it. This association believes that at this time of national salvation, we should not have internal conflicts. If the authorities in Sichuan can make a clear statement, then it can prove that the accusers are wrong. Therefore, on September, telegrams were sent to Chengdu Military Commander Liu Wenhui and Chongqing Military Commander Liu Xiang, asking them to respond quickly by telegram to reassure the people. Soon, Military Commander Liu Wenhui replied by telegram, stating that Wenhui was internally seeking harmony, compromising himself for the sake of others, and that this was his consistent goal, witnessed by the gods. Even if people do not understand me, I will try to avoid it. However, I can make concessions and never start a war, etc. Military Commander Liu Xiang also replied by telegram, stating how could we kill each other and lightly start a war? The military action you inquired about is completely fictitious. It is just that there are many rumors and some people may be dissatisfied and intend to provoke, etc. This association carefully examined the wording of the two telegrams. Although the meanings were different, they were consistent in denying the war. We immediately announced it. By early October, the rumors became even more urgent. This association sent telegrams to both parties again, asking them to quickly order their troops not to act rashly. After the telegram was sent, Liu Wenhui responded to the telegram again, stating that he could settle disputes internally and would not hesitate to make compromises. He still hoped that those who are greedy and rebellious would awaken so as not to betray his sincere teachings, etc. However, Liu Xiang did not respond. Not long after, the war broke out. This association sent letters and telegrams, urging a cessation of hostilities, but to no avail. Even when the central conference and the ministry telegraphed to stop the war, and the National Government issued a clear order to cease fire on November, it not only failed to move the listeners who were inciting chaos, but it even intensified. Even street fighting occurred in the provincial capital, and the city was turned into rubble, with more than 40,000 houses destroyed and more than 10,000 citizens killed, opening up an unprecedented catastrophe in Sichuan in three hundred years. This association repeatedly received reports and was extremely pained and angry. At the same time, the International League of Nations was holding a conference in Geneva, and our country's representatives were striving to uphold justice. But looking back at the domestic situation, it was as if our enemies were pleased and our friends were regretful. Who is responsible for this? The crime cannot be concealed. On the 23rd of last month, this association again received a telegram from Military Commander Liu Wenhui stating the course of his retreat, voluntarily giving up defenses everywhere, hoping that someone would uphold justice and resolve the dispute as soon as possible. This association immediately sent the telegram to the National Government Military Council Military and Political Department, reiterating strict orders to generals on all sides to instruct their troops to abide by the government's order to cease fire and asking Military Commander Liu Xiang to express his agreement with the peace proposal and jointly plan for a settlement. After the telegram was sent, we received a reply from the Military Council, stating that the Sichuan war was being resolved, but there was still no indication from Military Commander Liu Xiang. According to reports in the newspapers in recent days, Military Commander Liu Xiang has scheduled a general offensive, and the war has intensified again. The failure to stop the Sichuan war this time is attributable to him, and there is no denying it. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai newspapers, a telegram from Chengdu on November 12 stated that Rongzhang Municipal Elementary School teachers and students were propagating the abolition of war and were arrested by Wang Zanxu's troops of the Chongqing Army, detained in the headquarters, and the leading student, Shen Xuanheng, was immediately executed. Not only that, but the Chongqing telegram on December 2 stated that after the Xinshu Daily published the National Government's order to cease fire, it was investigated and sealed by the garrison department, and people in Sichuan mediated, and the person in charge wrote a letter of repentance to settle the matter. It is that Military Commander Liu Xiang not only stopped the people's anti-civil war movement, but also resented the National Government's ceasefire order and vented his anger on the Xinshu Daily. What about the protection of human rights? What about freedom of speech? On the same day, a telegram from Chongqing stated that Liu Xiang had detained Lan Wenbin, a brigade commander of the 21st Army, for opposing the civil war for 20 days and executed him by shooting on December 1. Furthermore, the Yutong Bank, which has strong capital, was sealed by Liu Xiang because it did not underwrite the third phase of financial public bonds, all cash was confiscated, and the manager was imprisoned. If he disregarded everything, was fond of chaos by nature, and acted arbitrarily and violently, he was directly intolerable to the national law and public opinion. According to Article 2, Item 3 of the association's constitution, if a civil war unfortunately occurs, the association's group members and individual members should unanimously refuse to cooperate. It was specially approved by the third meeting of the Standing Committee on the 10th of this month that the crimes of Liu Xiang, who violated the orders of the National Government, continued the civil war, sealed newspapers and banks, and shot students, should be announced in a telegram, and it was formally decided not to cooperate with Liu Xiang. For this purpose, this special telegram is sent to you. We request that the central government use its administrative power to severely sanction and dismiss him from all positions, which should not be tolerated. We also hope that the people's groups and public opinion organs across the country will express their views and jointly condemn him. Members of this association should especially earnestly implement the association's charter and refuse any cooperation with Liu Xiang to ensure that this criminal of civil war, who divides the country and causes chaos, is intolerable to the people of the whole country, and is subject to severe condemnation, more severe than axes and halberds. We offer these painful words in the hope that you will take note. The third standing committee of the General Alliance for the Abolition of Civil War: Standing members Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Wu Daquan, Liu Zhanen, Qian Xinzhi, Lu Jianquan, Pu Xinya, Jin Jianquan, Song Yuting, Chen Liting, Zhou Zuomin, Chen Peide, Leng Zhanqi, Yang Meizhen, Li Gongpu, Hu Shuhua, Fu Yueqi, Li Denghui, Yuan Songxun, Liu Shimu, Wang Yansong, Yu Xiaochuan, Xu Huaiqing, Wang Yi, Li Kuian, Yan Esheng, Yu Rongqiao, Lin Junbao, Chen Shi, Ma Wenhui, Xu Jiqing, Chen Zheqing, Lu Zhangyuan, Di , Zhou Xuexiang, Zhu Xuefan kowtow,</p>

<p>Second Remittance of 18,440 Yuan</p>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Association of Manila, Philippines and the United Nations Anti-Japanese Relief Association, yesterday transferred 18,440.012 yuan in national currency through the Shanghai China &amp; South Sea Bank to Mr. Zhu Qing, each receiving half to aid the anti-Japanese Northeast [illegible]. It is learned that the association previously remitted 18,600 yuan, this is the second remittance. It is understood from the original letter [illegible], the Japanese invaders have intensified their aggression, the people of the Northeast are in dire straits, calling for help. The central government provides insufficient protection, and even the volunteer army fighting bitterly for years lacks adequate supplies. How can we not be pained by this? Fortunately, our [Mr. Zhu] is a pillar of strength, admired by the whole nation. This glimmer of hope is only for you. We overseas Chinese regret that we cannot take up arms to obey your orders, but we will each fulfill our duties [illegible], so that our soldiers who charge into the fray and sacrifice themselves for the country will not lack material resources. We will gather grass [illegible]. Therefore, we have remitted all 9,220.06 yuan raised to you, sir, for proper distribution to boost the morale of the troops and to save the country. We are praying that you will soon sing a triumphant song. Respectfully to Commander Zhu of the Northeast National Salvation Army, The Guangdong Provincial Association of the Philippines and the United Nations Anti-Japanese Relief Association, Chairman Huang Haishan, Treasurer Wu Shilai, Secretary Wu [illegible].</p>

We still earnestly request the association to consider and allocate funds for relief, so that the spirit of loyalty and righteousness may be upheld and the success of the restoration may be achieved. This is our earnest hope."</p>
<p>▲ Donation from Transportation Soldiers: The association received a letter from the First Regiment of Transportation Soldiers, sent by the Southern soldiers, stating: "We, the officers and soldiers of this regiment, deeply admire the Northeastern Volunteer Army's years of arduous fighting.

<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army Transportation Corps, after being ordered to cease activities by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, initially planned to disband immediately, temporarily dismissing all staff and awaiting an opportunity. However, all the initiators of the corps, over a dozen people, intended to go out to the passes to join the Volunteer Army out of their patriotic aspirations. He Yuanhun, Commander-in-Chief of the Rehe National Salvation Army, commissioned Bo Wei, Commander of the Sixth Route Army, and Liu Daxiong, Counselor of the Sixty-First Division of the Nineteenth Route Army, believing that the corps's organizational purpose was perfectly suited to the needs of the Volunteer Army, felt it was a pity to stop it. Therefore, they explained the misunderstanding to the authorities, who approved its establishment and guided the resumption of work, renaming it the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Transportation Corps. The initiators of the corps, Zheng Jianbo and others, expressed their gratitude and immediately found an office location at the Chenxiangge on Dajichang Street, and it was decided to start working today.</p>

<p>▲ Talking about the Relief Situation Outside the Passes</p>
<p>After the first batch of members of the Northeastern Volunteer Army Medical Team arrived in Jinxi, they immediately started medical work in the Qi Jizhou unit of the Volunteer Army on the Fourth Road in Jinxi. Currently, due to the lack of medicine at the front, the team specially sent its member, You Chunsheng, back to Shanghai to report to the office about the medical situation outside the passes and to request the allocation of medicines to be transported to the front to meet the urgent needs. According to You Chunsheng, after the news of the Soviet army's withdrawal spread, the Volunteer Armies on all fronts were extremely indignant and willing to fight to the last ditch against the Japanese invaders. They are currently training soldiers and horses, and will issue an attack order within days. Therefore, there is an urgent need for medical supplies. He was specially sent to Shanghai to contact the rear, and he will return to the front as soon as the medicines are ready. He also said that it has been snowing in the area since November 4, and the Volunteer Army medical team is still working in the freezing cold wearing only thin cotton clothes. Therefore, he hopes that all sectors will find ways to provide assistance, so that the comrades at the front can serve with peace of mind.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Shareholders' Rights Protection Association of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Hosted the Press Yesterday <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Government's Acquisition of Shares at Fifty Taels</p>
<p>Will Send Representatives to Petition the Third Plenary Session in Beijing</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, since the government issued an order to prepare funds to take back the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the shareholders of the company have risen up to form a Legal Rights Protection Association to study the interests of the shareholders. Yesterday, the association held a tea party for the press at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association in Shanghai on Xizang Road, attended by dozens of people. During the meeting, Li Zhengwu, the organizer of the association, first stood up to report the purpose of inviting the reporters and said that he hoped that the media would uphold public opinion. Then, Li Cishan stood up to report the origin of the Shareholders' Rights Protection Association and to request the government to take into account the interests of the shareholders. The speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Li Cishan reported on behalf of the association: "We are all shareholders holding shares in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Accumulated Assets Company. Our shares are traded annually without a market, but the assets of our two major companies are valuable. According to reports from experts and responsible personnel, there are indeed huge sums of 50 million to 70 million taels. Recently, we saw the order from the National Government, according to the proposal of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation, to decide to return the shares of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to state ownership, giving each set of shares a price of fifty taels. We, the people, do not have much to say about this strict order from the government. However, we heard an ancient saying, 'In a country ruled by law, orders cannot change laws.' We, the shareholders of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, remember that on December 21, 1929, the National Government issued a glorious order, 'The Regulations on the Supervision of Public Utility Enterprises Operated by Private Individuals are hereby formulated and promulgated.' Article 2, paragraph 5 of these regulations specifically includes the two words 'shipping.' Our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, operated by private individuals, is naturally a public utility enterprise operated by private individuals subject to these regulations. These regulations are our golden rules, so we cannot but remember them firmly. Articles 14 and 15 of these regulations stipulate the methods for returning enterprises to public ownership. Article 14 was amended once on February 7, 1931. The current text is: 'Article 14. After thirty years from the establishment of a public utility enterprise operated by private individuals, the supervisory authority may take it back into public ownership at a price, but must notify one year in advance.' Article 14, paragraph 2, states: 'For public utility enterprises operated by private individuals established before the implementation of these regulations, after thirty years from the implementation of these regulations, the provisions of the preceding paragraph may be used to take them back into public ownership. If the time limit is shorter, it shall be in accordance with its regulations.' Article 15 states: 'When a public utility enterprise operated by private individuals is taken back into public ownership, it shall be paid according to the price assessed by experts based on the total amount of its existing assets.' Article 15, paragraph 2, states: 'If there is a disagreement with the aforementioned valuation, the local court shall send one person, and the local autonomous group and the Chamber of Commerce shall each send two people to form a valuation committee to review and determine the price.' This is the law formally promulgated by our National Government. This law was promulgated and implemented on December 11, 1929. By November of this year, it will be two years and eleven months. According to the mandate given by the law, our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company operated by private individuals still has seventeen years and one month. Can it be taken back into public ownership immediately without notice, shortening its legal life? This is the first point we should study. The total amount of existing assets of our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Accumulated Assets Company, according to expert reports, is more than 50 million taels. After deducting the repayment of debts, the assets owned by our shareholders, calculated at 84,000 shares, should be worth more than 600 taels per share. According to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation's claim, calculated at 1,200 taels per set. Now, regardless of the total amount of our assets, let's just talk about the number of shares. The words 'total amount of existing assets' are still prominently displayed in the current law. I don't know what kind of law this method of calculating by set is based on. This is the second point we should study. The law clearly states that when taking it back into public ownership, it should be based on the total amount of its existing assets, according to the price assessed by experts. Now, we are given 50 taels of cash per set, and I don't know which expert's report this is based on, and whether it is the total amount calculated based on the value of those assets. This is the third point we should study. We hold shares in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and of course we hope that these shares will be protected by the law already granted to us. We are citizens of the Republic of China, and we especially hope that the laws of the Republic of China will maintain their due credibility and effectiveness. If the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation want to propose amendments in advance, to return the company to public ownership, they are free to amend the law to whatever extent, or indefinitely, or without giving a price, as long as they follow the legislative procedure and promulgate and implement it, it will take effect. However, they did not do any work to amend the law. Under the very clear and detailed regulations mentioned earlier, they are depriving us of more than twenty-three years of legal rights without any basis. In order to protect our own interests, we cannot willingly endure this. In order to respect the use of national laws and the effectiveness of laws, we also need to discuss with the government and ask them to consider it. The reason why we organized the 'Shareholders' Rights Protection Association' is precisely for this."</p>
<p>Petitioning in Beijing</p>
<p>According to Li Cishan, although the association has not yet officially published a notice to register shareholdings, it has already received official letters and telegrams from shareholders stating that more than shares have been registered. The association plans to petition the government after reaching 20,000 registered households and will send representatives to Beijing to petition during the Third Plenary Session, and consult with the Supervisory Yuan and the Legislative Yuan on the issue of the government's takeover of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>

<p>The Special Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Party, due to the Japanese police's unauthorized arrest of Chinese seamen on the British ship "Russian Queen," sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Consulate in Nagasaki requesting negotiations with the Japanese side. Now, they have found a copy of their urgent telegram to the Tokyo General Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, which reads as follows: "To the Tokyo General Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang: Previously, we read in the newspapers about the Japanese police's unauthorized arrest of Chinese seamen on the British ship 'Russian Queen.' We ordered personnel to investigate with the shipping company. Later, we received a report stating that a Japanese worker was injured due to an accident on the 'Russian Queen,' resulting in the detention of three Chinese seamen by the Japanese police, who have not yet been released. The incident has occurred more than a week ago. We dare not speculate on the current situation. If it is indeed true, we earnestly request your department to negotiate with the ambassador to Japan for their release and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future, so as to protect the safety of seamen. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nagasaki Consulate, we are sending this telegram to you for your information and response. Sincerely, the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch Preparation Committee."</p>

<p>Chiang Individually Receives Visitors</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM on the 5th, Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, received Xu Shiying, Wen Lantao, Li Zushen, Qian Hua (representing this newspaper), Lu Yi (representing the Xinwen News), and Wan Shen Sun Faxu and Xu Guozhi, representatives of the Shanghai fundraising committee for the temporary disaster relief in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, at the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. At the same time, he also received four representatives of the Nanjing-Beiping disaster area inspection group in individual meetings. Due to his busy schedule, the conversation time was limited to three minutes. Xu and this newspaper's reporter arrived at the headquarters at 10:30 AM. After waiting in the reception room for a while, Chiang met them one by one. The details of the conversations are recorded separately below. 1. When Xu Shiying paid his respects, he first recounted the inspection of the dike project and the organization process of the disaster relief association in Jiangxin. Then, he reported four points: (1) Please ask the headquarters to send personnel to demarcate the inspection route of the bandit area. (2) All sectors in Shanghai have begun raising funds for the emergency disaster relief in the three provinces and will do their best to allocate funds for disaster relief in one county as soon as possible and actively carry out the relief in the fastest way. (3) The method is based entirely on the rural relief regulations issued by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. (4) A portion of the surcharge on electricity and water can be allocated to disaster relief funds. Please ask the government to negotiate with Chairman Song. Chiang responded that Xu was already old and it was not appropriate for him to travel to the bandit area and endure all kinds of hardships. He asked him to return to Shanghai as soon as possible to take charge of everything. 2. When Wen Lantao met with Chiang, he said briefly that he was very satisfied with the dike project he had inspected along the way. It was rare to see such a historical project completed during the Commander-in-Chief's time. He hoped that the Commander-in-Chief would pay special attention to future protection. He also said that the Commander-in-Chief's bandit suppression was out of love for the people, and Lantao was now willing to ask for love for things, that is, the fish in the West Lake had been approved by the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to be released, but Mayor Zhao had disobeyed the order. Please ask the Commander-in-Chief to find a way to deal with it. Chiang immediately agreed and asked Wen not to travel far again. Wen said that the Commander-in-Chief was so hardworking and able to endure hardship. As a member of the people, how dare Lantao be afraid of hard work? 3. When Li Zushen paid his respects, he stated the necessity of external propaganda, such as the completion of this dike project, to show the world the efforts of the Chinese people and the cooperation between the government and the people, so that the post-disaster recovery could be done quickly.</p>
<p>Chiang's Talk</p>
<p>When Chiang met with this newspaper's reporter, he said that he would return to Beijing within a week to attend the Third Plenary Session and would come to Wuhan in about a month to preside over the bandit suppression. This newspaper's reporter asked the Commander-in-Chief whether he had any special proposals for the Third Plenary Session. (Answer) I am currently organizing them. (Question) Will they be submitted jointly with Mr. Wang? (Answer) Not yet decided. (Question) In terms of diplomacy, if the League of Nations cannot resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, will the government determine its own response policy? (Answer) Regarding diplomatic matters, the government has determined a detailed response policy. (Question) In terms of domestic affairs, unity and sincerity are the main goals in times of national crisis. In your opinion, can it be done based on the current situation? (Answer) Given time, it can definitely be done. (Question) Can Mr. Hu Zhantang and the two gentlemen, Yan and Feng, go to Beijing to attend the First Plenary Session? (Answer) There has been no news recently. (Question) There are rumors that the Commander-in-Chief has formed a fascist and blue-shirt group. The headquarters has repeatedly corrected this, but the rumors have not stopped. What is the truth? (Answer) I have heard nothing about this. It is all unfounded rumors. Please tell the Shanghai press." The conversation time was long, and the reporter took his leave. (Qian Hua from Hankou, December 5)</p>

<h3 id="e107">Xing Zhigang Submits a Request to Yan Shenyu to Request the Provincial Office to Return Two Years of Borrowed Grain <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the Fifth District Chief of Shanghai County, yesterday submitted a report to the County Government, requesting that it be forwarded to the Provincial Office to allocate the prepaid Winter Dredging for the fifteenth and twentieth years to alleviate the people's difficulties. The report continued, requesting that the Provincial Office follow the original plan to allocate the prepaid winter grain to uphold national credibility and comfort the people's hopes. It was found that over the years, Jiangsu Province had borrowed winter grain in advance, accumulating a debt of four yuan and five jiao per stone. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Finance Department formulated a plan to allocate and repay it in installments over five years, from the nineteenth year to the twenty-third year, to be fully repaid as scheduled. The Provincial Government Committee decided to issue a public announcement in conjunction with the Finance Department, which can be verified. However, in the nineteenth year, due to insufficient provincial government budget, an order was received to postpone the repayment. In the twentieth year, the district was hit by continuous rain and disaster. After the autumn harvest, the district chief requested to allocate the pre-borrowed winter grain for the tenth and twentieth years to alleviate the disaster situation. The government issued the Finance Department Directive No. 4770, which stated: "The report is noted. Regarding the borrowed grain, according to the original plan, this department will repay it in full this year. However, this year's continuous rain and disaster have resulted in a significant shortfall in provincial revenue. If we return the borrowed grain, it will be even more difficult to sustain. This department has already submitted a report to the Provincial Government, which has decided to postpone it for one year. The order is to comply. Therefore, there is no need to protect it. You should immediately inform the district." Given the previous situation, a directive was issued to inform the district. It was noted that after this year's military disaster and famine, the people's morale was revived. Although the autumn harvest was relatively abundant, the price was surprisingly low, and the cotton consumption was reduced. It was insufficient to recover the losses of last year. The people's livelihood was deteriorating. The provincial government had already issued a clear order to postpone the repayment of borrowed grain for one year. In the minds of the people, national credibility could be maintained. When the one-year period expires, it should be repaid according to the plan. The eager expectation is like birds waiting to be fed. However, recently, the news of continued postponement of the winter grain levy has caused the people to lose hope and panic. The district chief witnessed the people's difficulties and, based on the township chiefs' inquiries, dared to request the governor to forward a report to the Provincial Office, approving the allocation of 1.8 yuan per stone of pre-borrowed winter grain for the nineteenth and twentieth years, in order to maintain national credibility and relieve the people's difficulties. This is truly a public service.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Shanghai radio broadcasting issue is expected to be resolved soon. It is rumored that this week, representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council will meet with the Chinese Radio Administration to jointly manage all radio stations in China, including those in the Shanghai concessions. In the future, Nanjing will designate the call signs and wavelengths to be used. According to the current plan, radio stations in the International Settlement and the French Concession must first apply to the Chinese Radio Administration for the call signs and wavelengths to be used. Then, the radio stations in the concessions must register with the competent authorities. The Chinese Radio Administration is currently equipping itself with wave detection machinery. It is expected that the Chinese and foreign authorities will agree on a cooperative basis for joint management of radio stations in the concessions. If radio stations still arbitrarily disregard the designated wavelengths and disrupt radio waves, Chinese experts will investigate and provide evidence, and the foreign officials in charge of the concessions will stop them.</p>

<p>The body has become charred</p>
<p>The tragic scene is heartbreaking</p>
<p>No. 4, Ronghua Lane, Milu Road, French Concession, is a building with three floors above ground and two side rooms. In the east side room downstairs, a man surnamed Xu runs a toy shop, using sulfur ammunition to make toy guns for children. He hires male and female workers to teach people how to make small dots of ammunition on paper. Yesterday, at 0:20 PM, it is unknown how, but he was careless, and the sparks spread to the sulfur. Suddenly, the wind picked up, and the fire became even fiercer. In an instant, it spread to the neighbors. The neighbors were unable to rescue anything and rushed out to escape and sound the alarm. One person was unable to escape and died in the fire. The fire brigade arrived after hearing the news and extinguished the fire in about an hour. The fire destroyed five or six houses on either side. Later, the fire brigade dug out a corpse from the rubble. The limbs had been charred, and the head and limbs were broken and incomplete. The intestines flowed out of the abdomen, a terrible sight. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for an autopsy, and the court will be requested to inspect it today. The police station sent detectives to investigate and arrest the arsonist, who is said to have fled. After the incident, it was discovered that a female worker, Duan, 32 years old, from Huzhou, resident of No. 1 Yongkang Lane, Fangbang Road, was missing. It is unknown if she was the person who was burned to death. After an hour and a half, the seventeen rooms in the front, middle, and back buildings were completely destroyed. This can be considered a great disaster for the place.</p>
<p>Total Losses After the fire broke out, because of the bursting of bullets, all the personnel in the office who were enforcing the law and rescuing people, all kinds of case files and important objects in the office, as well as the uniforms and bedding of the police officers, etc., were not able to be taken out. As for the firearms, in addition to the rifles carried by the police officers on duty outside, it is reported that there were still ten rifles, seven Mauser pistols, four pistols, and hundreds of large and small bullets in the office, which were all burned. Fortunately, the police escaped quickly, so no one was injured when the bullets exploded. The total estimated loss is several tens of thousands of gold. As for the detention center in the office, there were no prisoners detained that night, otherwise, due to the danger of flying bullets, they would have had to be released, which would have been too late.</p>

<p>A patrol officer's charcoal stove caused a major disaster</p>
<p>The Third District, First Branch of the Pudong Yangjiadu Public Security Bureau suddenly caught fire at 6:45 PM last night. Soon, the fire reached the firearms and bullets, causing explosions, making it impossible to extinguish. As a result, all seventeen rooms of the branch were completely burned down. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Branch Situation The branch is located on the west side of Yangjiadu Street. It used to be an ancient temple, which was converted into a police station during the Shanghai Police Department era. There are three buildings in the front, middle, and back, facing south. The front building is the dispatch room, detention center, and household registration reporting office. The middle building has a ceremonial hall in the center, the chief's office on the right, and the patrol officer's office and armory on the left. The four temple rooms are the dormitories for the patrol officers. The three rooms in the back are the kitchen and warehouse. Therefore, the area is quite large, and the buildings are very sturdy. As for the surroundings of the branch, the front is the main street, the east and west sides are long alleys, and the west and north sides are vacant land of the Commercial Bureau's new warehouse. Therefore, there are no adjacent buildings on any side.</p>

<p>At 6:45 PM last night, the patrol officer Ouyang Liang lit a charcoal stove in the patrol officer's office to keep warm because the weather was very cold. Unexpectedly, while adjusting the fire, sparks flew out. Patrol Officer Ouyang's bed was covered with straw, and the sparks landed on the straw, causing it to ignite. Patrol Officer Ouyang thought it would be easy to extinguish, but the fire spread to the wallpaper around the room, making it impossible to control. At this time, the chief Yang Zhongquan and the patrol officers rushed over after hearing the alarm. Seeing the patrol officer trying to put out the fire in a confused state, they quickly rescued him. They found that Ouyang's face and hands had been burned. They immediately sounded the alarm whistle for help. In a short while, the fire broke through the roof and spread to the adjacent armory. The bullets of the rifles and pistols were heated by the fire and exploded one after another, flying in all directions. The patrol officers, fearing danger, could not provide any rescue and had to flee. As a result, the fire became more and more uncontrollable.</p>

<p>The fire was raging, and the red light pierced the sky. Even on a moonlit night, it could be seen from three to five li away. At that time, the north wind was strong, and the fire spread in all directions. The Pudong Fire Brigade heard the alarm and rushed several pump trucks to the scene to put out the fire. However, the location was far from the Huangpu River, and the water in the nearby small river was also scarce, making it difficult to do anything. Before long, the middle and back buildings were completely burned down. The fire was raging, and the front building was also quickly engulfed. The firefighters tried their best to put out the fire with water, but to no avail. After another half hour, the front building was also completely destroyed. At this point, the fire could not be extinguished and gradually diminished, but the interior was still burning fiercely. A total of</p>

<p>The roof has a very large hole punched through it</p>
<p>Nine people injured, three seriously</p>
<p>At 2:19 PM yesterday, the iron chimney of the Fengtai Silk Factory in Zhabei was suddenly blown down by a strong wind, punching through the roof and injuring many people. Nine people were sent to the hospital. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Site Survey The Fengtai Silk Factory has been operating for many years, managed by Sun Xianbin (zi Rongchang). It is located between Pingjiang Bridge and Dayang Bridge on the west side, built along the Tanzi River, covering an area of more than ten mu. The main gate faces west. The buildings are very sturdy, all built with forty-inch bricks. There are two floors, with more than 600 male and female workers, mostly female workers.</p>
<p>Incident Situation At 2:15 PM yesterday, when the female workers in the silk reeling workshop upstairs were working, amidst the roar of the northwest wind, they suddenly heard a crashing sound. More than 600 male and female workers were all terrified. A hole about two or three zhang in circumference had been punched through the roof of the silk reeling workshop. Tiles, wooden boards, and other debris fell in a chaotic manner. The workers rushed to escape. Fortunately, the workshop had four wide sluice gates and ladders, and no one was trampled and injured. However, in the area where the accident occurred in the workshop, from No. 140 to No. 154, many people were injured, some in the head, some in the hands and feet, and some in the back.</p>
<p>Injured Names After the accident, the factory manager Sun Rongzhang and other employees rushed to the scene. At the same time, Ge Ruiwei, the patrol officer of the Tanziwan branch of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, and patrol officers Zhang Lingqing and Cao Jinyang also led more than ten police officers to rush to the scene. In addition to letting all the slightly injured workers off work, the more seriously injured were sent to the Longhua Hospital for treatment in the factory manager's own car. There were a total of nine people, all women, mostly teenage girls. Their names are listed as follows: Ni Xiaohua, Sun Cuinan, Sun Wu, Li Yindi, Xu Wang, Sun Caizhen, Nie Hu, Li Wang, Cao Zhu. Among them, Sun Caizhen, Li Wang, and Nie Hu were the most seriously injured.</p>
<p>Post-Incident Observation At about 4 PM, after hearing the news, the reporter drove to observe the scene. He handed his card to the factory manager Sun Rongchang, inquired about the above situation, and was then led by Sun to observe the various locations. He saw that the chimney was made of five-tenths-inch thick steel plates, with a total of twenty-seven sections, about five or six zhang high, and four chi two cun in diameter. It was secured on all sides with iron cables. However, the wind was too strong, causing the disaster. According to Sun, if the buildings had not been sturdy, the disaster would have been even more severe. Although many people were injured this time, there should be no danger to life, which is considered fortunate. However, the loss of repair costs is very large, and it will take about a week to restore to the original state.</p>
<p>The body burned to death cannot be identified. The gender must be determined after an examination today.</p>

<p>▲ Monthly income of only ten yuan</p>
<p>▲ Very poor economy</p>
<p>Xi Chunqiao, a partner of Dalun Silk and Satin Store, was kidnapped on the 9th of this month while traveling from Suzhou to Dongting Dongshan on the Yutai Ferry. In fact, Xi is very poor and works as a low-level clerk, an ordinary merchant. The kidnappers mistakenly thought that Xi was rich and kidnapped him without further investigation. Xi Chunqiao is already 61 years old. He used to work at the Yuanchang Silk and Satin Store in the city and later worked at the Jiuhe Silk and Satin Store. He resigned due to old age and was recommended by a friend to work at Da with a salary of more than ten yuan. He has only an old wife at home and no children. His daily economy is very poor. However, he is honest and has never made any mistakes in more than forty years. Only because he stutters, he could not explain clearly when he was kidnapped. Therefore, the kidnappers saw that he looked tall and burly, and he also had some money that he was carrying home for a fellow villager, so they did not ask about his background and kidnapped him suddenly. It was a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Ningbo Fellow Association Responds to the Yin County Government, Expressing Opinions on Clearing Sand Fields <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai believes that the former Ningbo Sand Field Branch's handling of the Yin County sand fields has violated the law and disturbed the people, arousing resentment from the victimized owners. Although the Zhejiang Provincial Government has proposed remedial measures, many of them are excessive and deviate from the facts, failing to effectively correct the situation and suppressing public opinion. Yesterday, they specifically raised their opinions and sent a letter to the Yin County Government, requesting them to vigorously preside over the matter. The letter stated: "Upon receiving your letter and the attached Civil Affairs Department's clearance of sand fields to remedy the situation and resolve the various methods, we immediately invited fellow villagers to the association to view them. Everyone believes that the methods proposed by the Civil Affairs Department are excessively biased towards the facts, ignoring the detailed regulations of the Ministry, which is not what a country ruled by law should do. The Sand Field Branch has regulations to follow, but it should follow them but does not, often using approved special cases as an excuse, which is an undeniable violation of the law and oppression of the people. Now, after consultation with the fellow villagers, we propose the following opinions: 1. In the future, the various detailed regulations for clearing sand fields in Zhejiang issued by the Ministry must be strictly followed by the county bureau, and no special cases should be used to make the people have nowhere to turn. 2. When handling , the county bureau should still follow the procedures stipulated by the Ministry and conduct on-site inspections. 3. All cases that have been because the branch has not followed the legal procedures should be announced as invalid." For this matter, we ask Your Excellency, the County Magistrate, to vigorously preside over it, so as to uphold the law and resolve disputes. It is also reported that the owners being tried will organize a Property Rights Protection Committee in Shanghai to handle the registration procedures for victimized owners and vow to oppose the illegal actions of the Sand Field Branch.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Turning a Small Matter into a Big Issue: A Meaningless Dispute Between Friends <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A dispute arising from neon lights and automobiles</p>
<p>Chen Wentao and Cao Yuanfeng become enemies</p>
<p>Friends unsuccessfully attempt to mediate at Y品香</p>
<p>Going to the police station in the middle of the night to confront each other, and even resolving it in court</p>
<p>丨Cao Yuanfeng is acquitted for speaking irresponsibly while drunk丨</p>
<p>Chen Wentao, a salesman for the Xingguang Electric Automobile Advertising Company at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, had recently secured a deal with the Nanjing Hotel to install neon lights made of red and green glass tubes, priced at 3,703 taels of silver. The hotel paid a large portion of the price in cash, with the remaining 1,202 taels to be paid with a promissory note due on November 15th. When the due date arrived, Chen Wentao presented the note for payment. However, Chen's colleague, Cao Yuanfeng, had previously purchased a car from the hotel manager for 900 yuan, paying only 300 yuan and still owing 600 yuan. Cao had not repaid this debt. Therefore, the hotel wanted to deduct the amount owed by Cao from the payment to Chen. Lu Jian resolutely refused. Last Saturday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Chen and Cao negotiated at Xingguang because of this financial entanglement, with Chen claiming that Cao's overdue car payment had made it difficult for him to receive his payment. During the discussion, Chen's anger was visible, and the two sides started arguing and then wrestling. The colleagues tried their best to mediate, and the two sides reluctantly retreated, each with minor injuries. B Zhiying and Li Dayu, intervened as mediators and invited both Chen and Cao to a room at the Y品香 Hotel that evening, hoping that the two would be able to resolve their grievances face-to-face. Although Chen responded to the invitation, Cao could not be found anywhere. The group waited until midnight, but Cao still did not appear, so everyone dispersed. Chen also returned to his home at 193 Qingyu Lane, Dagu Road. However, as he approached the entrance of Qingyu Lane, he saw car number 3838 parked there. Chen knew that the car belonged to Cao. At that moment, seeing the car reminded him of the man, and he suspected that Cao was still angry about what happened during the day and had come to provoke him. Therefore, he dared not go home immediately. Coincidentally, two Chinese constables were on guard at numbers 2203 and 1044 near the alley entrance. Chen told them what had happened and asked them to accompany him home to avoid being harassed by Cao. Both constables agreed. However, when they arrived at his home, Cao was not there. Chen asked his family, and they all said that Cao had not come. Chen then relaxed and went to bed. Unexpectedly, just as he was deep in a sweet dream, the head of the Xinzha police station, Zhao Rongsheng, and the Western inspector, Mr. Wilcocks, arrived at his house, woke Chen up, and summoned him to the police station for questioning. It turned out that after Cao Yuanfeng was persuaded to stop fighting by B and Li, he had no way to vent his anger. He harbored it in his heart until late at night. Not only could he not calm his anger, but he also thought about Chen's job, which had been recommended by Cao himself. Now Chen was publicly disrespecting him, repaying kindness with ingratitude. Who could tolerate this? So he drove to Chen's house, intending to reason with him. However, when he arrived at the door, Chen had not yet returned from Y品香, and Chen's wife refused to open the door late at night, so he returned in vain. On the way, he was almost taken advantage of by petty thieves. Cao became even more suspicious that Chen had plotted against him. Therefore, he reported to the police station, saying that as he was walking out of Qingyu Lane, there was no light in the alley. He only saw three dark figures following closely behind him. Suddenly, he was struck on the head twice with a metal object. He fell down in pain, and when he got up, the dark figures had disappeared. Cao was certain that Chen had a handgun, so he did not dare to chase after them. The police chief felt that the matter was extremely strange and could not believe it. However, Cao firmly insisted that what he encountered was the truth, and he resolutely signed his name on the written record, indicating that if he made a false accusation, he would willingly accept the consequences. When the Chinese and Western detectives brought Chen in for questioning and investigated, it was proven that Chen was still at Y品香 at the time. Cao was then enlightened. Chen also declared that he had a handgun because he was a special constable number 725, but he had surrendered the gun to the police department on the 15th of last month. Cao's report about the handgun was also a lie. The police chief immediately ordered Cao to be detained. Yesterday morning, Cao was handed over to the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Yanqi questioned him. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the case, stating that Cao had indeed violated Article 180 of the Criminal Code, the crime of false accusation. However, after the investigation was clarified, Cao admitted that he had spoken irresponsibly while drunk, which could be excused. He requested the court to consider this. The defendant hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. Chen Wentao also hired lawyer Zhang Jiahui, stating that he was falsely accused for no reason and that Chen should file a private lawsuit to seek compensation for reputational damages. After Judge Wu questioned both parties and witness B Zhiying, he ruled that the defendant was acquitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhou Xuegen asks: "I feel that my current job is completely incompatible with my personality. My aversion to my current job is not because I am vain, accustomed to luxury, unwilling to endure hardship, and only want to earn a high salary and achieve a superior position. I just feel that the business I work for is full of feudal colors, extremely conservative, and has no progress at all. The hiring standards only value age, not talent. The entire fate is already entering the abyss of decline. I have no hope for my future. Therefore, I feel that I must find another way out. Although I have an aversion to my current job, I will continue to serve until I get a suitable job. On the one hand, I continue to study hard in my spare time, preparing for the opportunity to come in the future, so that I can abandon the job that is not suitable for my personality and take the job that is suitable for my personality. I am planning like this, please ask whether it is appropriate or not?" Reply: "From your letter, I can know that you have a considerable understanding and considerable insights into the current society, and you are also a young man with vigor and ambition. On this point alone, I can conclude that your future must be bright. We fully agree with your plan. We believe that as long as a person is willing to work hard, there is no problem that cannot be solved. With knowledge, you never have to worry about not having a use for it. However, your efforts should not be solely for the 'individual', but also remember the entire 'society' at all times."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Mingchun asks: "My friend, Mr. Chen, is already engaged."</p>
<p>"His fiancée dropped out of school halfway through. Chen asked his parents-in-law to allow her to continue her studies, but his parents-in-law refused and instead became resentful towards Chen. Chen is very disappointed and feels that his fiancée's personality is incompatible with his own. She also cannot manage household affairs. He is considering dissolving the engagement. However, Chen has a job that was introduced by his father-in-law. If he proposes to dissolve the engagement, he is afraid that he will be criticized for being ungrateful. If he does not dissolve the engagement, the future happiness of Chen and his fiancée will be hindered. Is there a better way to resolve this?"</p>
<p>Reply: "Knowing that the other party's 'personality is incompatible with one's own' and still getting engaged is already a mistake. If what is stated in the letter is true, then there are only two options: dissolve the engagement or not. Apart from this, there is no better way to have both. Regarding the problem of Chen's fiancée's schooling, other methods can still be used, such as entrusting someone to discuss it. If Chen feels that his fiancée's personality is fundamentally incompatible with his own, then there is really no way to force it. The marriage issue is of great importance to personal happiness and cannot be used as an exchange item for other conditions. Chen only needs to ask whether dissolving the engagement is 'appropriate' or 'inappropriate'. The unreasonable criticism from society is completely irrelevant." Mr. Lu Xianglin asks: "I have been an apprentice mechanic for two years. Now, due to the shutdown of the factory, I will have to find another job to make a living. Should I continue to learn to be a mechanic? Or should I abandon my original goal and choose another occupation?" "It seems that what the letter says, there is still some hope in entrusting relatives and friends. It's just a matter of 'time'. Since it is impossible to wait passively, it is necessary to think of other methods. But thinking of other methods does not absolutely mean abandoning the mechanic profession. You may as well regard the mechanic profession as your ideal and as the standard for choosing a career. If you can find a mechanic position, then jobs that are similar in nature to the mechanic profession are also possible. If you can't do it again, then temporarily take other professions with different natures, and pay attention to it at any time in the future."</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu Peiliang asks: (1) How to read books? (2) The shopkeeper oppresses me, and my actions are not free. Is there a way to solve it?</p>
<p>Reply: "Regarding the questions in your letter, I will answer them in two points: (1) Most of the current popular publications or books use symbol punctuation, but you still inevitably 'break sentences when reading'. This may be because what you are reading is too deep, or you have not deeply understood each word in a sentence. This is also 'speaking white words' (saying should be 'profession'). You should now first read things that you can understand and simple words slowly. Don't be impatient. If there are words you don't know or don't understand, you should look them up in the dictionary and make sure you understand every word and sentence. Over time, you will naturally see results. (2) The oppression of shop assistants by professional shopkeepers is a common phenomenon in today's society. This is a complete social problem. It is impossible to solve it alone. Now, on the one hand, you can try to improve yourself within the scope of not hindering your work, in order to cultivate your own skills. On the other hand, you can pay attention to opportunities and look for another job."</p>
<p>Xiang Junying asks: "A and B are competing for a piece of land. The land definitely belongs to B, but A knowingly occupies it without any deeds. How will this case be judged?"</p>
<p>Reply: "The trial focuses on evidence. If there is no contract, there should be other evidence, such as human witnesses, boundary stones, various registration certificates, etc. Anything that can prove that the land definitely belongs to B can be presented."</p>

The important resolutions made were as follows: (1) The province's education fees have been in arrears for several months, making it difficult for various education institutions to maintain their current operations. Regarding how to solicit payment, the following measures were resolved: 1. A representative group of eight institutions, including Jing Tang Zhenxi, was selected to formally request payment from the Education Fee Management Office, limiting the payment to be made before the end of January of the 12th year, clearing the operating expenses for November of the current year. 2. The representatives of the above-mentioned institutions will gather at the Jingmin Education Center at 2:00 PM on December 14th to go to the management office together. 3. If negotiations fail, they will take concerted action with representatives of primary and secondary schools on the 16th. 4. It is stipulated that the management office must issue expenses to the social education institutions simultaneously with the Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary School and the affiliated primary school. (2) The province's social education institutions' staff and teachers' treatment standards and the eligibility criteria for tenure, seniority pay, pension, and bereavement compensation are currently not clearly defined. Regarding whether the association should submit opinions for the department's reference, it was resolved that the director Zeng would separately send letters to each member to draft methods to be submitted to the board of directors for collation before the end of January of the 22nd year for the department's reference. (3) Regarding the proposal to temporarily suspend the payment of income tax because the treatment of the province's social education institutions' staff and teachers cannot be improved, it was resolved that: 1. The association will send a circular to the heads of each institution asking them to temporarily withhold the deducted and unremitted amounts and return the remitted amounts. 2. The association will send a circular to inform the staff and teachers' associations of each institution that after the association's constitution is amended, the Educational Institute, the Jiangsu Provincial Yinzhou Public Education Center, and the Sports Field will be elected as directors of the next joint association.</p>

<p>Screening Completed, Classes Resume on January 10th</p>
<p>A communication from Hainan states that the Shandong Provincial High School, which was dissolved by the Education Department on the 5th of this month due to the major unrest caused by opposing the joint entrance examination, has come to an end. As the weather is getting colder and the winter vacation is approaching, the Education Department has ordered the principal, Song Wu, to expedite the handling of the aftermath, which is now largely complete. According to Education Department Director He Siyuan, the high school is approved to resume classes on January 10th. The school will hold a school affairs meeting in the coming days to conduct student screening, and will resume classes immediately after the screening is completed. The missed classes and wasted time of the students this year will be compensated by extending the winter vacation next year. I plan to make a trip to Beijing around the time the high school starts to meet with Education Minister Zhu Jiahua to report on the province's disturbances. As for the city's schools, the winter vacation is scheduled to begin on the 18th of this month.</p>

<p>Group A is further divided according to individual circumstances, grouping those with similar defects together.</p>
<p>Groups B and C can be further divided according to age, height, and weight.</p>
<p>Group D can select various elective subjects according to the students' interests, such as martial arts competitions, sports, skill selection, dance, etc., and then be divided into groups.</p>
<p>Note: If classes are held in groups according to this example, attention must be paid to the timetable. It is best to dedicate the time after 2:00 PM every day to physical education and not schedule other classes.</p>
<p>(Example 2) According to the Cao Tong grade system:</p>
<p>First step: Divide each class into male and female groups.</p>
<p>Second step: Divide each class according to the physical examination results. Those who need special corrective exercises are separated into one group, and the rest are divided into several groups according to age, height, physical fitness, or skills. They still attend classes in the same class but use grouped teaching methods. Each group is set up with a group leader to assist the teachers in taking responsibility for order and leadership. The teachers must provide additional guidance and teaching to the group leaders.</p>

<p>Written due to the first defeat of the Batavia Qunli Team</p>
<p>After the football match that day, on the way home, a passionate supporter of Qunli said to me angrily, constantly blaming the other team members for not providing adequate support and ruining a winnable situation. In his overreaction, he even said that the Qunli were all useless people, and that his anger had reached boiling point, which is why he said such things. However, impartially speaking, apart from Adek Wu, there are probably no other truly outstanding players in Qunli. They do not have a thorough understanding of the science of football. Their practice sessions seem decent in terms of footwork and ball control, but once they are in a real match (especially after conceding a goal), they completely lose their normal control and instinct to manage the ball in a rush or in a state of over-anxiety. This is because</p>
<p>there is no good evidence of having experienced big matches, and the players invariably suffer from stage fright. To get rid of this problem, it is best to work hard on one's own skills, because as the saying goes, "A person with great skill has great courage." In a football match, only those with great skill are courageous and careful; only those who are courageous and careful can take full advantage. In addition, I have also heard that Qunli are always as brave as tigers when they encounter strong teams, performing exceptionally well, but when they encounter weak opponents, they perform poorly and without energy, so they often achieve unexpected feats. It is really unbelievable that Qunli was able to defeat the Chinese-Portuguese team last year, because everyone knows that the overall and individual strength of the Chinese-Portuguese team is much higher than that of Qunli. This kind of inconsistent state is also something that will only be discovered when each individual's skill has not reached perfection. With the old habit of saying what I know, I want to put forward a few points for my teammates to study, and on the one hand, I also hope that they will not think of me as a busybody and can pay a little attention: (1) Get rid of the habit of dribbling. (Dribbling can only be used when absolutely necessary or when one's own side is winning and wants to delay time.) (2) Learn to kick cross balls more often, so that one's kicks can reach where one wants them to go. (3) Passes should have a certain purpose and intention, as well as a considerable degree of accuracy. (Our team gets the ball no small number of times during matches, but after getting the ball, blind kicking is very common, and the effect is equal to nothing, and it also wastes energy. A wise man would not do this.) (4) Practice immediate kicking. (Many teammates have the bad habit of stopping the ball before kicking it. This must be greatly improved.) (5) The left foot is not very flexible. Sometimes, when the ball comes to the left foot, one has to lean the body to the right before one can execute a kick. However, all top-notch players use both left and right feet. Practice until the ball comes from either side and is controlled by that side to save time. Practice until you don't always have to look at the position of the ball when controlling it, but can imagine it in your feeling. Then you can say that you are a good player (6) Header is one of the important parts of the ball game. When topping, you should first observe the direction of the ball and predict the landing point. (7) When it is a few yards away from the landing point, you should make an effort to jump to the highest point that your strength can reach. When topping, do not be afraid of pain, do not shrink your neck, do not bend your waist, and do not bend your legs. Look at the ball with your eyes and concentrate on this top. Focus on the opportunity to respond, either forward or backward or left and right, so that the pass can reach your own team, which is the step that should be taken on the head. Our team's heading needs to be greatly improved. (8) Put the football on the football's freedom, and do more research on the time to distinguish the value of sooner or later (time is the most important point, and the effect is different if you kick the ball early or late. More people in our team think that it is a small thing and ignore it, and they are unwilling to study it, which is really wrong.) (9) Common sense should be learned more often, cut and studied more, and applied more practically. (For example, in the last game, the middle road was blocked, so we should have advanced to the side as soon as possible, and for example, when we lost the first ball at the beginning of the game, it was still early, but we were eager to retaliate and kicked the ball as if we were afraid of not being in a hurry. We lost the standard repeatedly in a hurry, and when we lost the second ball in the last five minutes, there was little time left, so we should have been back to the city. *</p>
<p>Borrow one, use a blitzkrieg to try to win back the draw, but instead take things calmly. When the ball comes to your feet, you take it yourself and are unwilling to release it, which is a mistake.</p>
<p>Think about it, no one can be perfect, and everyone has weaknesses. As long as you can make up your mind and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, you will make progress. (10) Be humble and willing to be taught, and do not be ashamed to ask questions. It is not shameful to ask others for advice if you do not understand, but it is really shameful to not understand but think you understand and disdain to ask others. Asking questions and discussing are shortcuts to success. I think that those who play football well do not necessarily have the ability to teach others. On the other hand, those who can teach others are not necessarily football players. It is beneficial to discuss a difficult problem with anyone. For example, I have always liked people to ask questions, although I dare not admit that I am a good teacher, and I dare not say that my own opinions, arguments, strategies and playing styles are the best, but I dare to say that I have been in the football world for more than ten years, and the two items of research and experience have indeed given me unlimited knowledge and the rewards of teaching and training. If you don't abandon me and come and talk about your football experience, I dare to guarantee that you will definitely gain some benefits from the discussion.</p>
<p>The above is only a rough idea. There are also some subtle points that I can't think of for a while, so I would like to ask everyone to use their brains to study them and work hard to improve. Brothers, let's get started. The lush garden of success does not limit who can enter it. As long as you have the desire to enter that beautiful garden, you will eventually reach it. Look, the gatekeeper of the Garden of Success is holding the key and smilingly waiting for you! !! (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e148">He Who Steals a Hook is Executed (III) <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>"Hey, hey! Don't run, Little Pockface, catch the thief!" A loud voice shouted behind Dafa. Sande, who was thinking about the things in the basket, was even more frightened than Dafa. He saw clearly that it wasn't shouting at him. His own hands hadn't reached into the basket yet.</p>
<p>The man who was browsing eggplants and green beans near Dafa stood up, and the two big baskets collided as he chased after the person in front.</p>
<p>"Catch this little thief, I turned around and he stole three big eggplants! ...... Hey, Mr. Lao San of the tofu shop, thank you for keeping an eye on my load!"</p>
<p>Those who heard it paid attention to this new excitement.</p>
<p>A child running in front stepped on something and almost slipped, but he ran desperately. There were many people on the road, and the more he wanted to run fast, the more quietly he ran. In the end, he was grabbed by a fat man with a long basket, who looked like a chef in a rich family. The child was as thin as firewood and couldn't withstand the powerful grab. He retreated crookedly for many steps and squatted on the ground. But the big eggplant in his hand was still tightly held and not let go. Just as he got up from the ground, the eggplant seller had already come up to him.</p>
<p>"Why are you stealing my things? I can't earn much money in a day's business. If you steal three, how can I make a living?"</p>
<p>The child had a fierce look on his face. Seeing the eggplant seller coming to snatch the things in his hand, he tried to run away like a madman, but he couldn't escape. He said...</p>
<p>"Just let me eat these three, I don't know how long it's been since I had anything to eat. Just do a good deed."</p>
<p>"If you want to eat, I want to eat too. If everyone comes to steal like you, I won't be able to eat. If you want to eat, you should go to your father. How can you start stealing at such a young age!"</p>
<p>"Then give me some to eat when you have food to eat! My father starved to death, and my mother does odd jobs sewing and can't support both of us. I have nowhere to go to beg for food."</p>
<p>The eggplant seller was stunned when he heard it. The child, like a hungry beast, wanted to rush past the crowd and escape again.</p>
<p>"This little bastard, listen to his nonsense. He's so young and already steals things. If he's not taught a lesson, what will he be like when he grows up?"</p>
<p>The child was angry when he heard this in the crowd. He threw an eggplant at the person, saying...</p>
<p>"It's not stealing yours, what's it to you! If I don't steal, I'll starve to death, you can't control me!"</p>
<p>The eggplant seller was really angry when he saw the child throwing his eggplant.</p>
<p>"Little thief, so it's right for you to steal other people's things?"</p>
<p>The person in the crowd who was hurt by the eggplant took two steps forward angrily and, together with the eggplant seller, raised his fists. The fists fell on the child's body.</p>
<p>"Ah," Dafa was careless for a moment, and when he looked again, the child's mouth was already bleeding.</p>
<p>Seeing the blood seemed to make everyone happy, and the lesson was over. They pushed the child aside, and before they had walked three steps, the child fell down again. The eggplant seller picked up the three eggplants and grumbled back to his own basket. Although he had lost a little,</p>
<p>This way, he would do a few less businesses, but he felt happy in his heart.</p>
<p>"Dafa, let's go, what are you standing there for?"</p>
<p>Dafa turned around and saw Sande holding a few big garlics and a few small radishes in his hands. He was strangely about to ask Dafa, when he suddenly understood everything.</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid of being beaten! Go to a small alley," Dafa asked anxiously, biting the radish.</p>
<p>"I'm more clever than the child. I also have to thank him, because people are anxious to watch the excitement, so I can start. I took it from a basket of people who bought a lot of big fish and meat. It's not worth eating raw fish and meat, so I'll be polite to him."</p>
<p>A smile appeared on Sande's face.</p>
<p>May 1932, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Is Love Unconditional? <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhuo Ji</p>
<p>Unconditional love has become a thing of the past. As for now, most people have admitted that love is not unconditional. Naturally, I am one of the majority.</p>
<p>Although it is generally acknowledged that love has conditions, the conditions vary from person to person. In fact, those who sing the praises of unconditional love have conditions implicitly contained in the essence of their love, but they themselves do not feel it or are unwilling to say it.</p>
<p>What are the conditions of love? People usually think that it is money, power, and beauty. It is no wonder that people misunderstand it like this, because many lovers often take this as a condition now. In fact, besides this, there are many other conditions, such as profound knowledge, noble morality, common thoughts, upward aspirations, strong will, special talents, strong body, appropriate age, gentle temperament, etc. After counting, it is always nothing more than two kinds of ranges: material and spiritual, or external and internal. A person can have one condition or several conditions as her or his standard for choosing a lover.</p>
<p>I dare to say that conditional love does not tarnish the sacredness of love. To judge whether sacred love is tarnished by conditions, one must first see what the conditions of the person who speaks of love are. In other words, only those who take money, power, and beauty as conditions are despicable and vulgar; and those who take knowledge, temperament, body, thought, ambition, talent, etc. as conditions are just, reasonable, and noble. The former's love can be said to be a buy-and-sell type, a pimp and prostitute type, while the latter's love is not. It is mutual love, it is truly pure love. The former is not love at all, it is simply a boring impulse, prone to danger. Either the woman is abandoned, or she has another lover, or she remarries. The latter is not the case. Their love is rationalized and has a deep foundation, so it is lasting and unchanging.</p>
<p>I feel that now that slightly ambitious women who want to be independent often regard marriage as an annoying problem. If they get married, their future will be buried in family life. If they do not get married, they will inevitably suffer the trouble of being pursued and slandered by those whose marriage proposals are not successful. Therefore, between marriage and non-marriage, one must choose one. Which is good? I think it's better not to get married. If you want to get married, you must be careful. Love should be rationalized, that is, to set reasonable and pure conditions to choose your partner, and never be tempted by money or gigolos. A marital relationship combined by such love will not only not make one's ambition decline, but also encourage each other to do what each other should do. Therefore, I advocate that love must have conditions.</p>
<p>"Is love conditional?" This is a practical question and an interesting question. Now this question has been re-raised by Ms. Wei Ji. "Young men" and "beautiful young ladies" who are burning with the fire of love, please consider carefully the questions that are closely related to you, and please make public your brilliant opinions.

<h3 id="e151">Performing Arts <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>In the Xinwen Bao and Shanghai Chen Bao the day before yesterday, and in yesterday's edition of this newspaper, Mr. Tao Xingzhi published an advertisement for performing arts, selling his writing, calligraphy, and lectures.</p>
<p>His advertisement contained four lines of poetry: "Who dares to unleash Li Kui's fire in these high winds? Even Wu Xun finds begging difficult! Suicide avoids imprisonment, but I'll never play the bowing game." These four lines not only depict an outline of this畸形 society, but also reflect Mr. Tao's entire personality. Unwilling to set fires, finding begging difficult, and suicide being a criminal act, how difficult it is to be a person in contemporary society!</p>
<p>Mr. Tao is an educator with principles. "Teaching, learning, doing" is his slogan. Anyone who has visited Xiaozhuang Normal School or read "Ancient Temple Bell Ringing Record" published in this newspaper will likely not doubt this statement. Therefore, Mr. Tao's writing and lectures are accumulated experience, full of "strength" and "ability." As for his calligraphy, it also possesses a composed strength. Regarding these, although Mr. Tao himself did not loudly proclaim like a melon seller, "How sweet my melons are!" we can prove that Mr. Tao's melons are indeed sweet!</p>
<p>Originally, in our country, everyone understands a little about business. Everything before us is nothing but "business dealings": buying and selling positions, buying and selling favors, buying and selling lives all become legitimate transactions. However, the female student selling her art at the Confucius Temple in Nanjing was expelled for allegedly damaging the school's reputation. From this, we can imagine that selling art is not easy. Precisely because art is not easy to sell, "favors" and "lives" are easy to sell. We do not want this phenomenon to continue, so we greatly approve of Mr. Tao's willingness to "bite the bullet and give it a try."</p>
<p>If society is discerning, I think Mr. Tao will not have to wait until "choosing an auspicious day to open," and will certainly have "a prosperous business!"</p>
<h3 id="e152">Hydroelectric Power <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong</p>
<p>People have long known to use the power of nature's water to promote human progress, such as water-powered rice hullers and water-powered mills. In recent centuries, the principles of electricity have been invented, and we have learned to use electromagnetism to generate electricity with mechanical power. Later, we were able to generate electricity from mountain streams. Therefore, in the past fifty or sixty years, humans have worked hard to develop water resources, and now we are at the height of the hydroelectric power era.</p>
<p>But what does a hydroelectric power project look like? First, a dam is built in the river to create a large reservoir upstream. If using lake water, this is naturally not necessary. Second, a water intake is built at a right angle to the river, and sediment or other debris is removed from the water. The water is then channeled through a waterway into a penstock. A penstock is inclined upwards at the water intake and is equipped with a pressure pipe to allow the water to descend rapidly. A water turbine is installed at the lower end of the pressure pipe, which rotates due to the impact of the water force. The water turbine is directly connected to a generator to produce electricity. The electricity then passes through a transformer to increase the voltage and is sent to a substation via power lines. Finally, the voltage is reduced at the substation and transmitted to users' homes.</p>
<p>Economical hydroelectric power plants are of course large-scale and capable of producing large amounts of electricity, but with technological advances and reduced operating costs, even small power plants are very economical. However, small power plants require many workers, so automated power plants that do not use workers are now very developed. There has been significant progress in this area recently.</p>
<p>Automated hydroelectric power plants are divided into two types. One type starts the motor of the automated power plant when the power supply in the main power plant is insufficient or when the main power plant's switch is closed due to necessity, and transmits a corresponding amount of power. The other type is purely automatic. For example, if the water level in the automated power plant's reservoir is completely stable at a certain height but its float continues to rise, the control circuit mechanism is automatically closed and the power plant begins to rotate. When the water level drops, the plant automatically stops and waits for the required water level to be restored.</p>
<h3 id="e153">The Lolo People of Yunnan (2) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yu</p>
<p>When it was time to drip water, many women and old men would put on clean clothes, fill a gold, silver, or other bottle or pot with clear water, and take it to the Burmese temple. Then, the Great Buddha would lead them in chanting scriptures while dripping the clear water from the bottles, drop by drop, onto the faces of each idol. It is said that this is to show respect to the idols. If they respect you, they will also sprinkle clear water on you.</p>
<p>The Burmese temple is kept exceptionally clean, so the people who live in the temple are often barefoot. No one is allowed to step into the place where the idols are worshiped wearing shoes. If they violate this rule, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(3) Their attire is similar to that of the Han Chinese due to their mingling, but in women's fashion, special sentiments are still expressed.</p>
<p>They do not bind their feet like country girls, nor do they constrict their chests like urban misses. In short, their bodies are very healthy. Although they keep long hair, they do not wear it over their shoulders. They wear short white tops and long black skirts. Their skirts are a whole piece of cloth five feet long and three feet wide. They wear a long belt around their waist at the edge of the skirt and tie it very tightly because they regard a slender waist as beautiful. On their heads, they wear headscarves like Indians, but their headscarves are very long. When they wrap them around their heads, it looks like they are wearing straw hats, so the scorching sun cannot tan their fair and tender faces.</p>
<p>In the past, both men and women liked to dye their teeth a lacquer-like black, considering it beautiful. Women also wore a pair of earrings. But now, such decorations can no longer win honor among the Lolo people and have almost disappeared.</p>
<p>They do not like to wear powder or rouge.</p>
<p>(4) Their customs. Speaking of their customs, they are truly interesting. I remember when I was in elementary school, I went with my grandfather to visit a Lolo family. When we sat down, the old host first sat on the left and then invited my grandfather to sit on the right. At that time, my grandfather also liked to pay attention to these vulgar etiquettes, so he rushed to the right side and gave the left seat to the old host. I was a bit confused when I saw this, and when I got home, I told my father, and he explained to me that the Lolo people consider the right side to be larger and the left side to be smaller, which is the opposite of the Han Chinese's custom of considering the left side to be larger and the right side to be smaller.</p>
<p>When we have guests at home, don't we prepare good food and accompany our guests while they eat and drink? But the Lolo people's etiquette is not like this. If the Lolo people treat you as an honored guest, they will set up a table of food for you to enjoy alone. In our eyes, this simply implies an intention to send the guest away, but to them, it is a special hospitality.</p>
<p>(5) Their Entertainment. Every year, ten days before the Qingming Festival, they have a religious form of entertainment called "Picking Flowers," or "Picking Big Flowers." At this time, they stop all work, put on new clothes, and everyone puts on a cheerful face, as if we were celebrating the New Year or Westerners were celebrating Christmas.</p>
<p>They begin this entertainment ten days before Qingming, but they only play the most lively on the tenth day before Qingming, so they call that day "Big Picking," and the previous days are called "Small Picking."</p>
<p>During the small picking, the young monks in the Burmese temple first beat the drums at the entrance of the Burmese temple, strike the gongs, knock the cymbals, and clap the small cymbals commonly used on stage, playing in a simple rhythm for half a day, indicating that the "picking flowers" game has begun. From this time on, many men and women freely gather at the Burmese temple every afternoon, each holding a handful of household flowers or wildflowers, and a pair of bowls -- either wooden bowls, porcelain bowls, or earthen bowls, and sometimes even gold bowls. This pair of bowls is prepared for "taking sand" in the clear stream.</p>

<h3 id="e154">The Crossroads of Era and Love 13 <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Yao Xing said, imitating the way a woman walks for Haiquan to see, and at the same time making a face. So the two of them laughed in the gloomy empty classroom for a while.</p>
<p>The old janitor cleaning the classroom walked in with a broom. They hurriedly walked out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Today, Tang Yaoxing treated Haiquan to dinner at a Russian restaurant at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Cardinal Mercier, and also talked to him a lot about the recent situation in the literary world. His main point was that China's literary and art circles are really too bad, a mess. As long as you settle on a proposition and work actively, you can definitely dominate the literary world. The reason why the literary and art circles were so bad in the past was that there was no school of thought with a clear proposition.</p>
<p>But Haiquan felt a little uncomfortable when he heard this, and couldn't help but retort to him.</p>
<p>"Didn't Brother Zhou, Brother Jin, and Brother Ma publish a literary magazine with a clear proposition?"</p>
<p>"What does that count for! The first sentence is two lines of tears, and the second sentence is a burst of hot blood. It's simply nonsense! There's no systematic theory at all."</p>
<p>Haiquan couldn't answer for a moment when Yao Xing retorted.</p>
<p>Zhou De, Jin Meishan, and Ma Zhiyu are the founders of the Mars Literary Society, which was recently established. They are promoting the banner of socialist literature and art and have published a new magazine called "Mars Literary Monthly." They are celebrating and cheering, like a newly opened grocery store, inviting a band of Western musicians to play and bang on their building, dinging and donging.</p>
<p>Haiquan thought that Tang Yaoxing's proposition was a bit too strong. Even if what he said was right, his manner of speaking with his neck tilted would really cause the other party to feel disgusted. Even a reasonable proposition would become an unreasonable one.</p>
<p>When they parted, Tang Yaoxing repeatedly urged him to introduce him to Mr. Chen Huamin another day, and asked him to keep it a secret.</p>
<p>When Haiquan took the tram back to Professor Zeng's residence, he heard a lot of noise in the house, as if many people were talking. He felt a little strange, so he stopped and peeked in. But he didn't understand a word, because the people inside were speaking Japanese. He thought there were guests in the front living room, so it was inconvenient to pass through there. He hurried to the back door and knocked, and the maid opened the door. As soon as he stepped in, he heard Mrs. Hezi coming out and standing by the door at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin is back? Have you had dinner?"</p>
<p>"I've eaten."</p>
<p>He replied and planned to go upstairs. But curiosity told him to steal a glance into the living room in front. He saw a Japanese man and two Japanese women. The man looked a bit old, at least over forty.</p>
<p>"They just came from the Japanese countryside. Let me entertain them for a while. I'm really sorry, Mr. Lin."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hezi smiled at him with one hand on the banister of the stairs. Her smile was a bit like begging for his pity. Haiquan didn't understand why she wanted to show him that kind of attitude. He just nodded and went straight upstairs.</p>
<p>When Tang Yaoxing asked him to join their literary group, he was seven-tenths willing. However, it was inconvenient to agree immediately and he had to be humble. Thinking that he would have the opportunity to publish his articles in the future, he couldn't help but feel happy again.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Gold Market Dominated by Buyers <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Under the influence of international news, yesterday's market was dominated by buyers. As a result, it rose 1.90 taels compared to last Saturday. In contrast, the silver market trended differently, with British falling and American rising, and the exchange rate rose by more than 2 cents. The price of gold opened lower, likely due to tight British bills and weak American bills. Later, both turned bullish. It was reported that US Secretary of State Stimson stated that war debts owed by Britain must be repaid according to the convention. Another report said that France was denied permission to use various currencies as collateral and should repay in cash. Upon hearing this news, the market's confidence strengthened, buying sentiment was strong, and market prices frequently rose sharply, surging by 7 to 8 taels, and then broke through the 800 tael mark (reaching 804.80 taels). The price retreated at noon, and there were no major changes in the afternoon market, seemingly reduced by 2 to 3 taels, because the exchange rate was stable. Later, it stood at 802 taels.</p>
<p>The morning session showed progress. Since early January, the two markets had fallen by 2.20 taels to 797.50 taels, followed by 6.60 taels. Recently, Heng Tai, Heng Chang, Yong Yuan Mao, and Yong Yuan Mao, etc. went up to the market to compete for purchases. Mccalli first absorbed February's British gold 1893753 and absorbed February's American gold 375, causing the market price to return to 2 taels, directly reaching 98.67 taels at 9:30. HSBC's listing was announced, and the American gold was lengthened by 25, because the exchange rate of the gold to British gold did not move, but the price of gold was not affected, only retreating to 8.23 taels. Soon after, news of debt repayment was heard, which was beneficial to the bulls, so the market situation was激. The price was fiercely boosted by Zhi Feng, Yong Heng Yu, Yuan Mao, Heng Chang, Yong Yuan, Xiang Yuan, Chun Yuan, Yuan Mao Yong and others who rushed to buy. Mitsui also absorbed 375 taels of gold in March, causing the price of gold to move straight forward, soaring by more than 5 taels. At 10:00, it was 803.7 taels. At this time, Yongfeng and hedgers sold, and each number changed to throwing American gold, and at 10:15, it was 0.019 taels. Before long, it still went upward, and Yuan Mao Fu Tai Xiang Heng Yu and scattered shorts quickly rushed to enter, and rose again by 2 taels, reaching 0.048 taels at 10:30. At that time, the old Citibank came out with American gold 375 in March, and each bank mutually made British gold 8125 in January, because Zhaofeng, Chang Yifeng, Yongyuan, Tai Dadecheng, Fuyu, etc. took the opportunity to sell, so it turned down, but the turnaround was only counted in cents, until 11:15, it was 0.02 taels, Heng Yu, Dadecheng Yuanchun, Hongkang Yong Yuanmao Yong entered, and pulled up another 1.67 taels, and at 11:20, it was 0.037 taels. At this time, Daxing Yong Chun and others came out again, and it only took four or five minutes to fall back by 2.2 taels, counting 0.015 taels, Fuyu and scattered households dragged in and raised it to 0.03 taels, entering the after-market peace, and the ups and downs were not counted in cents, until the noon closing was 0.027 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was ordinary, and the ending returned to 2.90 taels. The afternoon market opened at 0.024 taels, but only four or five were followed, and then Yifeng Yong bought in, so it rose to 0.035 taels, but the American gold was ordinary, and 1875 could be closed in January, and the same in December, so the gold exchange rate immediately retreated by 2.5 taels, for 0.01 taels. Repeatedly, a few households bought in and pulled it up about 2 taels, until 3:00 it was 0.028 taels, Zhi, Yong Yuanchun, Qian Chang Xiang, Shunli, etc. sold, the old Citibank came out with American gold 1875 in January, and Anda came out with 375 in March, causing the price to be difficult to stand, and it only took a few minutes to depreciate by 2 taels. At 3:15, it finally reached 800 taels. After entering the market, Yuanxiang purchased goods. At 3:30, it was 0.023 taels, Zhifeng Yong, Shunli Yuan, Xing Yong, etc. sold to 4:00 and it was 800 taels and 0.005 taels. Repeatedly, Yifeng Yong Daxing Yong Yuan Mao, etc. bought in, and the bank mutually made 3125 of American gold in February, and the money was good again by 1.0 tael. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 0.016 taels, which was 1.90 taels higher than the previous Saturday. According to the daily maximum price of 804.80 taels and the minimum price of 796.60 taels, the difference was 8.20 taels, and the red bar was calculated to add 12 taels.</p>
<p>The revealed price was less suppressed by ten taels. The revealed price was revealed with American gold in the big 25, so it was 857 taels, calculated at 58 taels. Then 52 taels and 54.5 taels were received at noon, which was ten taels less than the previous Saturday. The climb was 0.04 taels to 0.03 taels, and the water was 0.05 taels to 0.04 taels.</p>
<p>Each number has a strong desire for speculation. The transactions on the surface are still.

<p>▲Arrivals Scarce丨Prices in Production Areas Higher Than in Shanghai▲</p>
<p>The rise in the cotton market is intensifying, but overseas cotton markets are showing mixed trends, and the situation remains soft. The firmness in Shanghai is due to a lack of supplies from various sources, and prices in production areas are excessively high compared to Shanghai, resulting in very few goods being shipped to Shanghai. Although the price of foreign cotton has fallen compared to the past, it is still not particularly cheap. On Saturday, Shenxin purchased Indian cotton, which was Pingguo coarse lint cotton, in a quantity of 2,000 pieces at a price of 29.5 taels. The cotton market currently still has an upward trend.</p>

<p>丨丨Label Flour Rises Uniformly丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a uniform rising trend. Prices for foreign wheat improved by about 0.20 to 0.30 taels. On the trader side, the Tianjin traders remained unchanged, while the Dalian traders showed an intention to buy. The general public was also concerned about the payment of war bonds and deeply worried about significant changes in the gold market, leading to a boost in sentiment. In the afternoon sessions, near-term sentiment showed renewed strength. The Dalian traders continued to push prices up, and spot flour was being drawn out, estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 bags (one source said it was being shipped to northern Manchuria). This situation caused unusual excitement. Futures also showed an upward trend. However, the China Company, which was heavily burdened with new responsibilities, was selling, so the rise was slower. In conclusion, the current month rose by 0.03 taels, January-February rose by 0.025 taels, and March-May rose by 0.015 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Wheat Futures Improve in the Afternoon <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened in the morning, the prices for various months were generally stable. There were few transactions and no significant fluctuations. As the afternoon session approached, trading became slightly more active. However, the market prices for various periods were mostly paying attention due to the resurgence of the flour market. This was because the local inventory was depleted, and the market would not be able to move without relief from foreign wheat. Traders with fixed orders would be willing to sell if the market was not good, but would be unwilling to sell if the market was good, so the mentality of hoarding for profit could not be avoided. As a result, the current month improved by 0.03 taels, January remained unchanged, and February, March, and April each rose by 0.03 taels.</p>

Because the market was sluggish and funds were stranded, the owners had to reluctantly devalue to seek to sell. Thus, the visitor currency suddenly fell by about 0.5 yuan, which allowed the southern traders to buy 1200+ bags of Hunan Wu and ji rice. Other than the southern traders buying visitor currency, there was also a small bit of new Jiangxi machine red rice (200 bags), other sorts are not inquired. The northern traders were, because the Jiangzhe Du gates had not been open, and transport was not viable, so they turned their attention back to visitor rice. 130 bags of Hunan red rice were purchased, priced at 6.75-6.70 yuan. This test run was deemed profitable, and they would continue this going forward. There was Jiangxi machine red rice at 7.70 yuan (200 bags), then there was Chen Yuan rice at 7.60-7.40 yuan (700 bags), Wu machine Yuan rice at 8.089 (214 bags), Hunan machine Yuan rice (200+ bags) at 9.00 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Jinan Demon Bandit Case <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Recently, a rather noteworthy event occurred in society, namely the cracking of the demon bandit case in Jinan. A dispatch from Jinan on the 8th stated:</p>
<p>Early yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, the demon bandit case in Jinan was cracked. The culprits, including Song Wangshi, Le Chuan, Fu Binqi, and others, along with the confiscated full set of imperial paraphernalia, shrines, yellow silk banners, brocade robes, flags, and other items, were escorted to the bureau. The suspects are currently being held in detention. Most notably, according to Li Lechuan's confession, the Xuantong Emperor repeatedly sent people to negotiate, claiming that Japan could supply firearms to help achieve their goals, and that they had practiced numerous spells, so firearms might not be necessary. It is said that Li's conspiracy has been brewing for many years, with so-and-so to be prime minister, and so-and-so to be a general.</p>
<p>After reading this news, we feel there is indeed a need for investigation.</p>
<p>Firstly, it can be said that this was instigated by Japan, or at the very least, by the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Just look at Li Lechuan's confession, "The Xuantong Emperor sent people to say that Japan could supply firearms," and you can get a general idea. Factually speaking, this further proves the possibility of a Japanese conspiracy. Looking back, during the Jinan Incident of the 17th year [of the Republic, 1928], the city was occupied and disturbed by Japanese soldiers for several months, inevitably sowing many seeds of secret conspiracy. After several years of brewing, this has now taken the form of a nascent organization. More recently, since the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident, 1931], many traitors within the country have been secretly directed by the Japanese, hoping to engage in activities. A major operation by traitors was cracked in Hankou. Even in Shanghai, where people from all over gather, there are probably two such organizations. Moreover, Jinan is an important northern city, with close geographical and political ties to places like Pingjin [Beijing and Tianjin], so the claim of a Japanese conspiracy is indeed credible.</p>
<p>Secondly, the North is originally the cradle of Chinese culture, but in recent times, it has become a haven for feudal remnants and a gathering place for old forces. In the past, the Boxer Rebellion, which triggered the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion, occurred here. Recently, there has been the activity of various occult organizations that chant scriptures and worship Buddhas. This demon bandit organization is just like the Boxers. Moreover, in recent years, natural disasters and man-made calamities have been pressing down on the people. The major conflict between Han and Liu has turned homes into ruins and left people and animals in a state of unrest. Thus, ordinary people, either intoxicated by old novels or poisoned by consistent traditional, old ideas, form fantasies of praying for blessings and creating a "true Son of Heaven." This can also be understood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the emergence of this demon bandit organization is indeed caused by the terrible current society. Therefore, to eradicate such bandits, it is not enough to simply suppress them. We must first quell the internal strife, clarify the political situation, and resist foreign aggression. Only then will such evils have no opportunity to arise. Otherwise, "the wildfire cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows and it grows again," and such a farce will just be in full swing.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge</p>
<h3 id="e183">Wine <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Shuigen</p>
<p>Besides being a beverage, wine is also used as an ingredient in cooking in some places (like Shanghai). There are countless names for wine in various countries, but they are all essentially alcohol made from starch. Take starch-rich substances and steam them until cooked, then add yeast. The starch turns into sugar, then add brewing microbes, and the sugar turns into alcohol. The chemical reaction at this time is as follows:</p>
<p>B12H22O11 = H20 + 4C2H6OH4BO2 Maltose Water Alcohol Carbon Dioxide</p>
<p>Method of making wine: Soak glutinous rice in water, then rinse it clean with water. Pour it into a pot and steam it until hot. Take the cooked rice out and spread it on a clean place. After it cools, put it in a jar, add wine yeast, and mix it with the rice. If liquid flows out, add more distiller's yeast and clear water, so that it gradually swells up, becomes very hot, and produces small bubbles. Stir it a dozen times a day, for five or six days. After two or three months, put the cloudy liquid that the rice has turned into in a silk bag and press it on a wine press. That way, you can squeeze out the liquid, which is wine. But we cannot drink this wine yet, because it is raw, so we call it raw wine. After that, after a dozen days, when the wine dregs settle to the bottom of the jar, pour the raw wine into a pot and steam it for twenty minutes, and then this wine can be drunk, because it is cooked. This is roughly the method of making wine.</p>
<p>Types of wine: The types of wine vary due to the amount of alcohol content, the types of raw materials used, and the different additives. Therefore, the wines produced have various names. For example, whiskey contains 44%-55% alcohol, and brandy contains 50%-58% alcohol. Chinese sorghum wine and Fenjiu, etc., contain more than 3-5% alcohol. These are roughly the types of wines we usually drink.</p>
<p>The benefits and harms of wine: Drinking a small amount of wine can invigorate the spirit and activate the muscles and bones, but excessive and indiscriminate drinking is harmful to the kidneys, stomach, nerves, and blood vessels, and can also cause problems for future generations. Most of the mentally deficient and delinquent children in the world are descendants of alcoholics. Drunkenness and madness are also the causes of crime. Therefore, various countries have tried to ban alcohol or impose heavy taxes on it, but without effect. The United States of America, on the surface, has banned it, but there are still many people who secretly make, smuggle, and drink it. Their success in banning alcohol is roughly similar to our China's ban on opium!</p>
<p>Method of sobering up from drunkenness: We should not drink too much of the wine we usually drink. If we drink too much, even those who are good at drinking will easily get drunk. If we get drunk, it often leads to disaster. So now there is a very simple way to sober up a drunk person, roughly speaking: take a bowl of soy sauce soup (must be warm) and give it to the drunk person to drink, and they will immediately become clear-headed as usual. There is also another method: pour wine into a bowl, add preserved eggs and sugar, and even if you drink a lot, you won't get deadly drunk.</p>

<h3 id="e184">A Small Suggestion <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>In your newspaper on the 5th of this month, I saw the article "The Oppression of the Environment" written by Mr. Xu, which couldn't help but arouse my infinite feelings! Now, which apprentice is not suffering from "the oppression of the environment" and economic difficulties, and had no choice but to abandon their beloved school life and run into this evil society?</p>
<p>Like me, if I had not been affected by the environment in my childhood, without unexpected obstacles, and was able to have a good result, then at least I would have had considerable achievements to comfort myself.</p>
<p>Now, I am standing in the same position as Mr. Xu.</p>
<p>Based on my own experience, under the control of the environment, I live a monotonous life, with no slightest bit of interest, so I am depressed all day long. I think most apprentices must feel the same boredom. So, if we want to break this boredom, we must unite. The following is my small suggestion:</p>
<p>First step, for all apprentices who communicate in the [blank] column, I hope that the teacher will introduce us, so that we can be free. If this allows people with similar personalities to gradually become familiar with each other, then feelings can be melted together.</p>
<p>Second step, after feelings are melted together, we can further become close friends. Then, in the future, in terms of career, we can help each other. That is, in terms of life improvement and academic cultivation, it is also very beneficial.</p>
<p>The above is my humble opinion, I wonder what Mr. Xu thinks of it? At the same time, I hope that the apprentices in this city will put forward their opinions for discussion. As for the specific method, it is necessary to ask the enthusiastic teacher to stand in a leading position and indicate to us a direction to proceed. Hong Mingchang 12.8.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Under the same lifestyle, the joys and sorrows suffered are mostly the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, since Mr. Xu Jue's letter "The Oppression of the Environment" was published, we have received many similar letters one after another! Bu Chang said that his salary is limited and insufficient to support the family, that he is living the life of a horse all day long without the opportunity to read books and newspapers: not that since his father died, he has been unable to repay a large amount of debt, but that his mother is old and his sister is young, and he sees that there is no money to pay for the funeral and marriage, etc. ...... It's simply endless. In short, it is nothing more than because of the misery of life and economic panic, that they want to find a way out.</p>
<p>These letters, when we read them, are enough to seal and shed tears丨express deep sympathy. We want to try our best to find a way to solve these difficult problems, blowing everyone's cloud, so that everyone's life can be satisfied; but, what method do we have? We must know that everything in society is closely related. In this time of internal and external troubles, in this environment of sluggish market and rural bankruptcy; we can say: The problems of you are not individual, but social, nor are they individual incompetence, but the fundamental defects of the current society. Unless this defect is corrected and transformed, the individual's problems can never be solved.</p>
<p>We must also know that purely "looking up at the roof and sighing" is useless; sighing is sighing, and pain is still pain, right? The god of sorrow will not be as timid as a swallow, and be frightened away by your sigh, if you do not immediately think of an effective way to drive it away, it will often come to visit you. But where is the effective method? It is not in "the edge of the sky, the corner of the sea," it is still in each person's own self. The first to be able to see this and break the air of misery and sorrow, is to push Hongjun's letter!</p>
<p>Although the method mentioned in Hongjun's letter is still the principle of the preliminary stage, it is very valuable for public discussion. In the amateur talk of the second issue of the amateur weekly this Sunday (11th), the reporter has already briefly mentioned it, and now it will be published below, hoping that friends will concentrate their efforts and express their great opinions on this goal.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Why does your stomach hurt a bit!:::" It hurts so badly! When landing at Donggou, because I had already heard the Great Classics issue three orders and five applications to restrict you from going into the water when you arrived at the bathhouse, I deliberately hummed about a stomach ache, and as a result, of course, everyone else went into the water together, but I got the good job of accompanying you.</p>
<p>"Let's go over there and have a few ice creams!" I was so happy that I seemed to have suddenly reduced my age by ten years. Taking your arm, which was white, tender, and smooth, like a sculpture made of ivory, we laughed and jumped all the way to a frozen-drink shop built with bamboo poles and reed mats.</p>
<p>"That's right! You should drink more ice cream when your stomach hurts!" In your bright and lively eyes, as beautiful as the stars in the sky, a kind of smile that was half joy and half teasing flickered at me. I myself couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Little friend! Little piggy! Brother! 丨You are a man, not a woman. 丨You are really the most beautiful and intelligent little elf in the world! I will always admire you.</p>
<p>I myself admit that my emotional impulses are indeed a bit excessive: often when I am frustrated or proud, I have many abnormal actions. That day, of course, I was very proud, so cup after cup of Beauty Brand ice cream went into my stomach as easily as a mouthful of clear water. In an instant, it was already the beginning of the sixth cup.</p>
<p>"Don't drink anymore!" You reached out and snatched it away.</p>
<p>"Okay! Just this one cup, let me drink it again!" I pestered his mother like a naughty child. At the same time, I actually opened up five fingers, preparing to implement a forcible seizure policy.</p>
<p>Although there were extremely sincere smiles floating on our faces, neither of us was willing to give up our own opinions: a cup of ice cream became the target of the two sides' contention. In the end, you saw that you couldn't resist me: unexpectedly, the clever you actually threw this target in one hand to the ground, and at the same time stretched out your toes, and solved everything with just one kick.</p>
<p>You were obviously victorious, and lay on my knees laughing like crazy.</p>
<p>"They are so intimate!" The people on the side seat were quietly issuing a kind of envious whisper.</p>
<p>"They:::what are they?" I asked, leaning over your ear.</p>
<p>"They are probably brothers and sisters!" You replied vaguely.</p>
<p>"No! Mostly cousins!" I teased very proudly.</p>
<p>Haha! Dear little friend! Look, I remember this thing so carefully! To be honest, as long as everything that happened when you and I were together is engraved on my brain nerves like a branding iron.</p>
<p>Even the most common and simplest little action will never be missed.</p>
<p>In Gaoqiao, I drank ice cream wildly because of the excitement of being proud, and in Avenue Joffre, I drank ice cream wildly because of the excitement of being frustrated. Although it was the same excitement, but when I was in Zhonggaoqiao, you were limiting me by my side, so it wasn't excessive; on this day, those Russian girls next to me were urging me for the sake of their business, and there was no reason to come and dissuade me again! So, within fifty minutes, I actually finished drinking, no, I simply swallowed five large cups of ice cream. In the end, I added two large cups of red bean shaved ice. It can be said that I have done my best to drink water!</p>
<p>However, people are not made of iron after all! Half a day's work of wind and rain, and a large amount of cold drinks, finally broke out together when I lay in bed. Vomiting, diarrhea, and fever all came to shake hands with me at the same time. The next day, 丨was the morning of the day I got up·The sunlight slowly stretched out its head from the window, and sent me a mocking sneer through the glass: I got a headache and struggled desperately. My head hurt like Sun Wukong heard the Tightening Spell, it hurt so much that it seemed to have split into several pieces.</p>
<p>"Ah! I really can't leave today!" I reluctantly climbed out of bed, but unexpectedly, my body seemed to be stuffed into a bag of cotton, shaking and unable to stand straight; my legs were also determined not to obey my orders anymore, and walking one step was simply more difficult than climbing a mountain. Therefore, I had a half-negative thought of starting a day later. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Strange Overseas News: Animals and Insects Can Also Perform <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Movies are realistic everywhere, so everything in the universe that people can see should also be seen in movies, so rare birds and animals, poisonous snakes and insects, etc., can also be seen in movies from time to time to expand our people's horizons. Among the various film companies in Hollywood, the one that needs the most various animals is Paramount. And Mr. Bill Pierce, the director of the purchasing department of Paramount, also has quite a wide range of talent, so the company, no matter what it needs, he can always find a way to get it, and never fails to live up to his mission. Not long ago, this Mr. Bill Pierce received an order from the company, telling him to find two thousand Crimson formicidae. Of course, Crimson is red, but what is formicidae? Bill had never heard of it, so he turned to the foreign Kangxi dictionary, and it turned out that it was the scientific name of a kind of red ant. What are these red ants used for? They are used in the movie "King of the Beasts". There is a scene in which two hunters are killed by a lion, but red ants gather and join the bodies of the two people, and are finished in an instant. So Bill searched for the gathering place of this terrifying red ant in southern California. By chance, a gentleman discovered this red ant in his garden and wanted to find a way to exterminate it. So Bill discussed it with him, using honey to lure the red ants, put them in cans, and took them to the film scene for application.</p>
<p>Bill feels that there is no difficulty in finding and training various kinds of beasts, but ordinary training is absolutely different from that under the thousands of strong lights in the photography studio. Often, an animal, after a long period of training, becomes as dull as a wooden chicken when it arrives at the photography studio, or even reveals its violent nature due to fright. Furthermore, fierce beasts such as lions and tigers only recognize the people who train them, and do not buy anyone else's account at all. Once, Paramount was filming a scene in a circus. A lion filmed a scene all morning, and it was really as tame as a cat rabbit. When the trainer was present, all the actors mixed with it without any fear. When it was time for lunch, the trainer went to eat. The lion's cage was placed in the photography studio. Several actors, because they had been playing with it all morning, thought it was very kind, and still went near the cage to tease the lion. Who knew that when the lion saw that the trainer was not around, it pounced on the people who entered the cage, and two were knocked to the ground by the lion at the same time. Fortunately, the trainer arrived in time and saved the lives of the two people, but that danger was really imminent.</p>

<p>Rochelle Hudson's charm is famous, and she is always willing to show off her jade arms. Her slim figure is really something that no one can not praise. She was born in Oklahoma eighteen years ago, and became famous as soon as she arrived in Hollywood, which is surprising to many people who cannot reach her.

<p>Reader's Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Material of the Film <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Fan</p>
<p>We feel that although the number of films published recently is very large, their descriptive vision is too biased on one side. Human affairs are so complex and life is so changing, is it possible that the material of the script can only be turned around and only between these men and women? What we see in the movie theater is just love stories, and we are really tired of watching them! We also understand that the producer's vision is biased towards love, in order to cater to the general audience, so no matter whether the story of the film is logical or not, and no matter whether the equipment of the film is sound or not, as long as there are men and women in the film, talking about love, it is hastily premiered. Of course, this kind of film can also be welcomed by a part of the people, but this aspect of success is the failure of the film itself!"</p>
<p>I am not absolutely opposed to the film not telling love stories. What I mean is: besides love stories, there are many fragments of life that can be described, and there are many satirizing, tragic aspects of life that can be used as film materials. If the director's vision can shine around him, where is there no good material? If the vision can reach the lower class, then its achievements are even unlimited! Let's look at the current large number of domestic films. Which film that talks about love and describes love is worth praising? And only one "Humanity" is more successful. In short, it seems that the current Chinese society does not need the sound of [] and paper fans, but needs a kind of how to stimulate this dying nation and make a new life for a nation? Wise screenwriters! I wonder what you think?</p>

<h3 id="e190">Ramon Novarro's Rise to Fame (Part 2) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Meng</p>
<p>He mingled in the romantic art world for a few years, and then went from New York to Los Angeles (where Hollywood is located). He left Marlene Muugen's song and dance troupe to seek the realization of his dream of one thousand dollars a week. At that time, his compatriot Valentino had already become famous, and people in the entire American film industry worshiped him like an idol. But Ramon Novarro continued his work without any regrets, and was quite content with himself.</p>
<p>What made Valentino famous was Rex Ingram. At that time, Ingram was engaged in the filming of The Prisoner of Zenda, and the role of Rupert of Hentzau had not yet been found. Ramon had already acted in a film at that time, but his experience was not very rich. He got a letter of introduction from a friend and went to see Ingram.</p>
<p>Ingram glanced at him and shook his head. He said, "I'm very sorry, your appearance happens to be the opposite of my character Rupert. Rupert is very tall, has fair skin, a haughty attitude, and is older than you." At that time, Ramon was only twenty-two years old, with black eyes and black hair, and was completely representative of Mexicans.</p>
<p>Ramon failed for a while, but he asked Ingram to let him try it anyway. Ingram told him that he could come again tomorrow, but he must not have any extravagant hopes, because his chances were as difficult as ascending to heaven. Ramon also asked Ingram to tell him what the character's character and appearance were like. Ingram wrote many words on the back of his letter of introduction and gave it to Ramon, telling him to go back.</p>
<p>Ramon seemed very disappointed to take back his letter of introduction and walked home, carefully studying the character's identity and appearance. He suddenly jumped up, ran to a clothing store, selected a set of clothes, and ran to Ingram's place early the next morning. When Ingram looked up, he was so surprised that he opened his mouth and couldn't speak. It turned out that Ramon's appearance had been changed to be exactly like the ideal character. Later, Ingram looked at him carefully again, and put a monocle on him. Ramon Novarro's face was still very smooth at that time, and the monocle slid down when he put it on, but the role of Rupert of Hentzau belonged to Ramon Novarro. This is the beginning of his rise to become a big star. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e191">A Scene of Ma Loufen and Li Minghui <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Lixuan</p>
<p>When Ma Loufen was thirteen years old, she was studying at Wanzhu Primary School in the Nine Acres area within the city. At that time, it so happened that the younger sister of the Li family, admiring the reputation of Wanzhu, disguised herself as a boy and came to study there. Her class was the same as Ma's; coincidentally, she also shared a desk with Ma. At first, of course, no one knew that a girl had suddenly appeared in the pure primary school. However, as time went on, Miss Li's behavior inevitably revealed her true identity. Moreover, because she was beautiful and charming, several classmates became particularly close to her. As for Ma Loufen, naturally, "being near the water tower, one gets the moon first." The two of them were almost inseparable at school. Whenever there was a holiday, Ma often rented a bicycle, letting Miss Li sit behind her, and they would ride to quiet places in the suburbs to play. At that time, their intimate demeanor certainly aroused jealousy among all the classmates. After two semesters, they attracted too much public attention, so they transferred to another school together. However, their affection remained strong. Later, Miss Li joined the singing and dancing world, and Ma also followed her. However, Miss Li's fame became too great, causing Ma to feel that she could never catch up. Nevertheless, Miss Li never forgot their past friendship. Thus, with the encouragement and support of Miss Li and her father, Jinhui, Ma Loufen achieved her current status.</p>

<p>— Xing Su</p>
<p>When Xue Juexian met Wang Cilong in Hong Kong, he asked Wang to introduce talent to assist in film production in Shanghai. Wang introduced his old friend, But Du Yu. Now that Xue has come to Shanghai and contacted But Du Yu, But has agreed to assist in the preparations. In the future, matters such as directing, set design, and hiring actors will all be entrusted to But. Whether the film production work will be entrusted to the American company Johnson is yet to be decided. Zhou Shilu will be in charge of the photography. The first work currently being prepared for filming is the sound film "White Gold Dragon," a masterpiece originally performed by Xue on stage. The script is from a foreign play, and the original text of the foreign script is given to But Du Yu as a reference when directing.</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Experience of Reading a Synopsis <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Chaoyang</p>
<p>Every theater has a synopsis. Its responsibility is to tell you the plot of the movie. In my experience, it's best not to read the synopsis before the movie starts.</p>
<p>The reason is this: If you've read the synopsis, you'll know the plot in advance, and the movie won't arouse much interest in you. If a woman is loved by two men, it's so boring if we already know which man will win! Knowing the plot in advance, your spirit will relax, and you won't be tense at all.</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Habit of Freely Squeezing Tears <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabe</p>
<p>The most difficult things to distinguish between crying and laughing are our eyes. The reason why a crying expression can often resemble a laughing one is because the eyes are too focused. When a person laughs, their spirit is active, so their eyes are focused; when crying, their spirit is passive, so their eyes are scattered. Without the help of a single tear, if you try to leave a crying expression for the camera, the result will often look like laughter. This is because the eyes are too focused.</p>
<p>When shooting crying close-ups (Close-in) on a large set, except for a few stars who have already developed the habit of freely squeezing tears, usually glycerin is dripped into the actor's eye sockets to replace real tears. Two tears slowly flowing down the face can completely conceal all the weaknesses of a crying expression. From this, it can be seen how valuable tears are in a crying expression.</p>
<p>Although the method of using glycerin is very clever, the taste when it is dripped into the eye sockets is similar to that of eye drops given by a doctor to patients with eye diseases. After dripping in glycerin, you still have to close your eyelids and wait for the lighting and camera to be fully adjusted, and then force out those two drops of glycerin when the camera starts rolling. It always looks a little unnatural.</p>
<p>For this reason, we should "aim high" when practicing and develop this habit of freely squeezing tears as early as possible. In the eyes of inexperienced people, it may be thought that this is impossible. In fact, as long as you are willing to put in a little effort in both psychology and breathing, freely squeezing tears is not a difficult task.</p>
<p>(The "Ugly and Unbearable Expressions" published yesterday should have been placed before the "Crying Without Breathing Assistance" from the day before yesterday. Due to the author's forgetting to indicate the number, this error occurred. Please forgive the readers. Author's note)</p>
