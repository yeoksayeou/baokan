<p>時評</p>
<h3>遥望山海關與關外彬</h3>
<p>上海停戰協定甫經簽字。而榆關之空氣。又突轉緊急。最近駐榆日軍。藉口演習。向我挑釁。其欲進窺榆關。控制平津。扼我門户。斷關内外之聨絡。俾得致力於東北全局之底定。蓋已昭然若揭。　　自九一八禍變以至放棄錦州。國人引領北望。旣憤强鄰之横暴。復痛不抵抗者之怯葸。茹悲忍痛。熱血怒火。早已不能自制。復經一二八禍變再作。淞滬亦淪於日軍之手。然而除少數自動先後各個英武抗爭外。其他軍人仍都持隔岸觀火之態度。不共起積極禦侮。遂爲日軍所各個擊破。凡此事實。誠足令國人痛心疾首。未能或忘。今榆關又告急矣。中央究將如何。彼負有衛國守土之重責者。又將下令撤退乎。　　據榆關守將何柱國旅長談。决誓死扼守。與天下第一關共存亡。壯哉此語。國人實皆已聞矣。吾人認榆關爲我重要門户。榆關而失。則華北完全被人控制。故際此緊急之時會。當局决不容持不積極準備之態度。一誤再誤。使門户之險。又落人手。而應集合全國力量。共謀抵抗。决不容使國土再失一寸。假如仍陽言抵抗。陰則觀望。是即爲誠心誤國禍國。換言之。即爲甘心出賣東北。日前張學良曾請示中央。中央復電衛國守土。張亦表示遵命。吾人民切盼此往復之電文。不再徒爲欺騙國人耳目之一種官樣文章。　　抑又有進者。目前東北各地之義勇軍。尚正在艱難奮鬥之中。吾人精神上認爲東北之未爲淪亡。滿洲僞國之未能鞏固樹立。都以有此義勇軍在。塞外孤軍。刻苦鏖戰。氣吞河嶽。義薄雲天。然而自滬局平定。停戰協定簽字。中央固已置（收回失地）（討伐僞國）於腦後。吾人民亦大都已忘却前日之創痛。重返於晏安耽毒之途。嗚呼。吾人其忍令東北四百七十六萬華方里。就此離我全國版圖而淪亡耶。其忍令東北三千萬同胞。長此呻吟於水深火熱之悲境耶。　　此次日本國内驟生大變。顯爲日本主義（法西斯蒂勢力）之日益抬頭。其對華侵略政策。將愈趨於强硬。蓋不卜可知。榆關之風雲。隨時可以掀起。國人如不急謀所以自處之道。則禍變之發。殆眞不堪設想矣。</p>

<h3>日内瓦近狀談（下）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>國聨範圍以外，歐美各國輿論上，都給我們有力的帮助，如蘇俄及近東的土耳其，埃及，美國更十分同情，即南美洲之阿根廷Argentine,巴西Bresil，智利Chile,這ＡＢＣ三國，雖不能與强國媲美，然在南美的勢力，也着實不小。以國聨會員及非會員的六十二國的輿論而言，就可以知道全世界對我表好感的，倒有五十餘國之多。所以這次中日糾紛，我國已得國際間在道德上絶對勝利的榮譽，然而榮譽究屬很空虚的，我們所要求的，乃是實際的獲得，如其國聨終於不能對日本採取切實有效的制裁，而迫令還我土地，償我損失，則我國又何必存着過分的夢想？已往國聨僅能説幾句公道話，以後是否能引用盟約第十六條，使日本屈服，即國聨中人，至今還認爲疑問！　　日内瓦近來冠蓋如雲，各國外交官，都非常活躍，現正召開的大會有四：（一）國聨行政大會，此會每年開會三次，五月爲常會期，中日問題，當然列爲重要的議案。（二）國聨十九人特委員，爲專門研究中日問題而特别設置的議會。（三）軍縮大會，此會因遠東問題的突發，故各國對軍縮方面，各有所戒備，可見中日一戰影響之鉅。（四）禁烟大會，自東北被佔爲國成立後，據説鴉片有專賣的動議，更引起此會熱烈的注意。以上這四個國際大會，都因爲中日事件而連帶發生許多關係，足見遠東問題嚴重性的一斑。我國現亦集中外交力量於日内瓦，如顔惠慶·劉文島·黄慕松·胡世澤諸氏，分頭出席上述四大會議，折衝樽俎，異常努力，事實上我國代表在日内瓦活動的能力，或且較勝於日本。可是外交全靠國力爲轉移，没有强有力的政府·堅强的民族·和雄厚的海陸空軍來做後盾，憑你外交家如何運用雄才大略，也是徒然的！其次一國的外交，必須確定他的外交政策，譬如人與人交際，有所謂（道義之交），或（患難之交），國與國亦何能例外？我國外交，向無一貫的政策，有時就不免陷於孤立的形勢。希望今而後，打破了國難的難關，進而刷新政治，充實國力，然後外交上才可操勝利的左劵。</p>
<h3>郭孝子</h3>

<p>瀏河有郭某者。世隸耕。春耘秋稼。舉家賴以給。有老母。瞽且病。終歲纒綿床蓐。郭事之唯謹。每有甘旨。輒以進。不敢私也。鄉里咸稱之。尋日軍進襲。郭居處適當火線之衝。其妻謂之曰。寇深矣。盍避去。郭曰。母老。復病瞽。跬步維艱。奉之奔波。是速其死也。若棄之。自求生存。珔下寗有是理乎。吾雖愚。亦不至此也。妻曰。然則坐以待斃乎。郭曰。母存與存。母亡與亡。求吾心之所安而已。死生奚畏哉。未幾。戰作。砲火甚烈。彈下如雨。村鄰盡避。獨郭奉母處之怡然。一夕。巨彈中其廬屋焚垣圮。闔家殉焉。　　舍親葉君。與郭比鄰。是夕以事逗村中。目覩其舉家就難。死事極慘。彼則刦燼餘生。避難來杭。爲余述其梗槪如此。爰表而出之。藉供世之一般梟獍其心者。讀之有所惕也。（却酬）</p>

<p>。他們於寒風雪花欺凌之下，提著豆大的油燈，移動了濕重的脚步，在等待雇用勞働的客人。　　這高聳，龐大的前門城樓，正如我在畫片裏看到的一樣，所不同的是現在加多了幾片雪花，樓前少了幾匹踱著沉著慢步有如詩人的駱駝。</p>

<p>罪惡博物院英京倫敦的蘇格蘭塲ScotlandYard中。有一個著名的黑博物院。BlackMu-Seum陳列罪犯們所用以犯罪的一切物品。形形色色。觸目驚心。最近意京羅馬。也新開了一所罪惡博物院。MuseumofCrim件質相同。其中陳列的。很有許多有趣的東西。一柄短劍。柄上刻着（科西嘉近親復仇）“CorsicaVendefta”字樣。而刀鋒上更有一句可怖的話。（願我所弄成的創傷足以致死。）此外又有一個專部。陳列罪犯們越獄脱逃的東西。内中有釘子鐵鍵等物。更有筆尖一種。是罪犯們用了細工夫。改成刀子一樣。更聰明的。是一種假手槍。完全以麵包製成。而塗以黑色。原來是一個罪犯用以恐嚇住了獄卒·竟被脱逃的。這博物院也像倫敦的黑博物院一樣。只能供專家參考。並不公用</p>

<p>先是佩孚軍敗。退守武昌。武昌武泰閘者。清末張之洞督兩湖時。以資百萬築成之。於是咸寗七邑得免水患。丙寅秋。水高於岸者二尺。行人没踝。某軍踞洪山。瞰擊城中。佩孚渡江至夏口。夕與圻坐室間談。其鍠牽簾入。見圻。欲有言而止。索紙書數行眎佩孚。佩孚曰。是非予所欲爲也。圻率爾曰。决江灌敵乎。佩孚曰然。公何由知爾。圻曰。子武曾謀諸吾。吾期期以爲不可。至是其鍠顧圻曰。幸秘之。毋爲它人語。其鍠退。圻乃正色對佩孚曰。此閘儻决。咸寗七縣皆淹没。七縣之民近千萬。敵卒祗四千。以四千之敵。而犠牲七縣之人。毋乃不可乎。且敵高踞洪山。平線在武昌城上二三十丈。决水則僅與江平。竊恐敵不一斃。而居民盡死焉。兩方樹幟舉兵。皆曰救民。我不救民。而反。我不救民。</p>
<p>殺民。何也。佩孚動容。乃止。其鍠計莫酬。銜圻甚。後其鍠死襄樊亂軍中。圻今猶健飯吟詩。天道可信。而不可信。不可信。而可信也。圻之事佩孚。艱苦備嘗。至於佩孚之敗。再起。復敗。圻乃去而之他。居三年。以非其人。未任一職。未建一言。携愛姬狄美南南歸。安居園林。不復有問世之志。圻之才識。匪常人所及。何止於工詩。詩則富唐人風韻。著有江山萬里樓集。　　我國之航空事業。肇始於民國二年。其初亦僅供軍事上運用也。袁世凱創辦南苑航空學校。以秦國鏞任校長。經始之時。校中有機六架。均係購自德國。各教練亦均德人。在民國三年剿擊白狼時。秦氏與某教練。曾一度各駕一機。飛豫省光山偵察。然以邇時駕駛窳劣之故。在軍事上殊少相當價值。社會人士。亦鮮有注意之者。然秦氏之在中國。則固不能不視爲航空界先導也。　　民五以後。航校曾一度擴充飛機至十二架。率者皆購自外國。以不善修理故。未久竟損去三四架。迨張作霖伸勢力於北京。頗知重視航空。然彼祇認東北爲根據地。故於南苑航校。絶不計畫擴充。反將校中完好飛機。擅取八架。運入東北。以爲空軍基礎。復分向美日充量購置。更聘外籍教官。積極訓練。於是東北空軍。遂以質量之充實優良。得嶄露頭角於國内。然以典守失職之故。九一八之變。卒資盜糧而長寇燄。而南苑航校。則因屢受摧殘。早已成爲歷史上之名詞矣。至於我國之民用航空事業。則肇始於十七年交部創辦之滬蓉航空。蓋最近期間事也。</p>

<h3>招請會計員</h3>
<p>在圓明園路的一所大厦内二層樓上，一張××公司的字條，貼在寫字問的彈簧門上，我就小心地推門進去，　　（昨天登在報上的招請會計員收賬員各一位交際員數位的就是這裏嗎？）我很謹愼面帶恭敬的態度，向那坐在寫字桌上的一位年約三十餘歲的先生問，　　（是的）他回答，　　（現在已經滿額了，但會計部尚有一個缺席，月薪卅元，膳宿自給，除舖保外，尚須現金保證二百元），他接着説，　　那時我就問他，旣有了殷實的舖保，爲何尚要二百元的現金保，他毫不躊躇的説道，（因爲有了舖保，雖有保證的可能，但倘有虧欠公司數十元或百數元的小欵，或發生較小的事情，那麽固然可以依法向保證者追償，但爲了這筆小欵，而請律師和訟費，恐得不償失，所以經敝公司經理的决議，自後招添職員，除舖保外，必須相當的現金保，）我聽了他這番言語，覺得亦有充分理由，我倆正待繼續説話的當兒，門外又跑進來二個年輕女子，果然她們來的任務，亦是爲了這事，他也照例的告訴她們種種待遇和條件，後來她們要求現金保，可否減少些，他很嚴正的表示，絲毫不能讓步，並且説這是公司所定的章程不消説都爲了這事，我因爲時間的關係，就寫了一個通信處，約定星期日的上午聽回音，我出了那寫字間，在歸途中自想着，在我踱進去的時候，他不是説祗有一個缺度了，但是後來接二連三的進去，他並未提起那句話，這是第一疑點，他旣登報招請會計員，無非是要物色要當人材，對於所請的職員，應有相當的考慮，是否能勝任其責，而他對於這一點，始終毫不注意，祗要有二百元的現金保和舖保的能力，就可錄用，這是第二疑點，　　到了星期日，那天因爲有了别事，不能前去，後來亦就把這事擱起，大約隔了三星期以後，我又在報上的聘請欄裏，看見類似的招請廣告，而絶他的地址，却在福熙路××公司裏面，第二天我恰巧經過那所在地，我就順便跑進去詢問，不料剛進門，就看見前在圓明園路和我談話的那位先生，同時有幾個先我進去的青年，他的談話，又和前次所説的絲毫没有差異，那時我更加疑惑起來，前次他旣説祇有一個缺席，而那天前往接洽者恐十倍不止，而何以又登偌大招請廣告，况招請職員，是一件光明正大的事情，爲何始則圓明園路，旣則福熙路，那其中的背景不言自明，　　逢年寫於五月十三晚</p>

<p>姑奶奶的那位十歲左右的小姑娘，每夜跟着太太少奶奶們，出去，耳濡目染的學會了輪盤賭，回來便模倣着，强要我和××，各人拿出錢來，陪她玩。銅元還不要，一定要銀元，有時搶了我們的三五塊銀元，堅不肯還，不向她要吧？我們辛苦一月，所得幾何？向她索討吧？她便不知輕重的把剪刀等鋭利的器具，亂戳亂擲，我們只好忍氣吞聲，不敢攖其凶鋒，　　他們寗願把整百的銀錢，輸在輪盤賭上，而不捨得買一具電器風扇，那位怕熱的胖太太，一到夏天，無論吃飯打牌，都呌我們站在她背後，替她扇着，繼續不斷地扇着，我們雖扇得手酸力乏，她還是惱怒地，怨天尤人，甚至賞我們兩個耳光，　　太太吃飯要扇，少爺和那姑少奶奶的小姑娘，也鬧着要扇，我們兩隻肉手，竟變做那不感覺困乏奇異電氣風扇。忙得汗流如雨，走頭無路，　　一般人的眼光裏，以爲奴婢們，似乎都是下賤而貪小，不顧廉恥的，所以主人少了銀錢或首飾等貴重的東西，都疑心是婢僕們偷的，我們那位缺少義方之訓而無知人之明的東家，平時防範我們更和防盜賊一樣的嚴厲，　　一天，不幸姑奶奶的一只金戒子和一只手鐲，都不翼而飛了，老爺太太們都聲色俱厲的説是我們偷的，勒令我們招出來，可憐我們氣得不能開口，他們把我們綑起來拷打一頓，又把我們全身和舖蓋衣包等都加以嚴密的搜查，還是查不出贓物·又痛打一頓硬生生説是給我們拿出去當了，逼着要當票，我和××那時都寗願給他們活活打死，却不甘心誣認自己做賊、　　太太雖然賠償了姑奶奶，但她想着破費了二三百塊洋錢，好不心痛，便擘擘拍拍的拿我們來出氣·我痛不欲生，幾番要想自殺，又怕死了更是寃沉海底，唉！那時生旣痛苦，死又不能，眞呌人難受哩！　　天有眼睛，後來這位少爺忽然染了梅毒，一天厲害一天，瞞不住老爺太太們了，追問原委，才恍然大悟偷金戒子金手鐲的乃是堂堂的少爺，而不是我們這些下賤的奴婢，才得打破他們的疑團，伸雪了我們的寃枉，　　Ｃ夫人聽得這裏，不禁念一聲（阿彌陀佛）引得我們哄堂大笑，才打斷了女僕的話柄，我也就起身告辭了，</p>

<p>大學生不閙閙學潮，便不算得爲大學生，　　學校中有了幾位運動健將，便可以替學校爭不少聲名，　　罷工風潮，是伙計歇老闆的生意，　　和摩登女子談貞操，簡直是對牛彈琴，　　自己有了一個博士碩士的頭銜，隨便放了一個臭屁，人家也會説是香的，　　在現在社會上混飯吃的人，若不會掉槍花，説謊話，這人便是屈死，　　卡片上若不多印了幾個頭銜，便不算爲闊老官，　　身是穿了中國的長衫，而褲子却洋裝的，這便是現在最時髦的服裝，</p>
<p>小可思議</p>
<h3>前倨後恭</h3>
<p>— 懦俠</p>
<p>一個中的婦人，對於她底丈夫王老闆，很誠懇的説：　　（寳寳篤爺，你今天還是没有事做，和我一塊兒到公司裏買點東西罷，）　　王老闆祗是坐在沙發上吸烟看報，當作没有聽見，直到第三次追問，才裝着笑臉答道，　　（給朋友們看見是很難爲情的，你還是自己一個人去罷，）　　她没有話好説，便懊喪地獨自走了，　　×　　×　　×　　×　　×　　王老闆對着他底愛人，很誠懇的説：　　（你今天到公司裏去買東西嗎？我陪你一塊兒去罷）　　他底愛人祇是對鏡抹粉，當作没有聽見，直到第三次追問，才裝着笑臉答道：　　（給姊妹們看見是很難爲情的，你還是等在家裏罷，）　　他没有話好説，瞧着愛人去了，便躺下摇椅上打瞌睡，專候她回來，</p>

<h3>投資一萬萬元之</h3>
<h3>一九三二年新車甘</h3>
<p>▲福特計劃最鉅美國汽車界中。近有一事頗能引人之注意。即福特公司努力於新福特汽車之製造是也。據福特公司宣稱。其造成之新汽車將運往全美二百個大城市中陳列。以供衆覽。福特公司此舉不但在美國汽車界中放一異彩。即多數之失業工人亦將蒙其利益。蓋亨利與愛特賽爾福特之新猷。大有與（不景氣）挑戰。而予失業問題以一個確切之解答也。福特之東部新廠在紐裘賽之愛琪華德地方。雖公司方面對於雇工人數。不願有所表示。但舊工人將儘先錄用之説。當頗可靠耳。目下在福特公司執業之工人。約有七○·○○○人。據估計。將增至一○○·○○○人。而最多時可容一二○·○○○名工人。入廠工作云。　　福特製造新汽車。其所需之流動資本。爲數甚屬可觀。蓋動輒以百萬金計算也。據美聨社消息。其費用包括者有如下列。（一）在地屈立屋地方。原料·運輸及人工。美金三○○·○○○·○○○元。（二）鐵道及輪船公司所費。八六·○○○·○○○金元。（三）每月採購新原料。五二·○○○·○○○金元。（四）裝飾及布帛用費。美金四八·○○○·○○○元。（五）市塲採購之鋼料。四七·○○○·○○○金元。（六）胎輪。美金二○·○○○·○○○元。（七）一○·○○○名工人每月工資。美金一八·○○○·○○○元。（八）本廠所造之鋼料。美金一六·○○○·○○○元。（九）玻璃費用。一○·○○○·○○○金元。（十）增添之機器。六·三七五·○○○金元。（十一）伸展性鑄鐵。五·○四四·○○○金元。（十二）漆料。四·八五四·○○○金元。（十三）粗橡皮。四·八○○·○○○金元。（十四）生鐵四·六八○·○○○金元。（十五）硬木。四·○○○·○○○金元。（十六）銅。三·五○○·○○○金元。（十）（七）鉛。一·五○○·○○○金元。照上述之數量估計。運輸需用之車輛。回内者二三六·○○○輛。向外者二二八·○○○輛。如是則鐵道人員將得工作甚多。而不致空閒虚度矣。　　福特公司總理愛特賽爾福特氏。於宣佈新車問世時。稱其父及渠深信。此時國内商業得有若干之復興可能。福氏又稱。（我等對於新車之前途。知之甚切。所欲造之汽車。當具汽車缸八隻。及極大之馬力。然其結構上則又極簡單。其特色一若其速率及力量。而其售價又當與大衆能購買之旨相符。余敢切實言之。建造此車時之一切成本。不在計算之中。蓋因成本算之愈切。則其售價亦必隨之而俱高。故造車時之時間與光陰。均不在計算之中者也。余等深明責職所在。想盡方法。以求工人之復業。目下此事業已着手。下星期四國人即可批判余儕之工作矣。除八汽缸及六十五匹馬力之汽車外。另造一種四汽缸及五十匹馬力者。此兩種之汽車均有十四個不同之式樣。但除引擎引。兩車大體上咸相同。車身及車架絶對相同。但兩車之售價則各各不同。因Ｖ八者將列於低價汽車之中。而（四）則更低廉者此爲余等服務駕駛公衆之本旨。尤其在目下之經濟狀况中也）。　　美國之汽車公司均投鉅資。以計劃一九三二年之汽車事業。其所投資之數。已逾美金一·○○○·○○○·○○○元、更有多數公司業已造成新車問世。其所計劃進步之處。有非數年來所意想者。此種進步之處。信能促進業務之向上。但届二月得悉福特之計劃後。則又不覺下退矣。其所受之打擊。尤以低價汽車爲愈甚。其他各汽車公司之領袖。咸冀此種鼓吹不過令人於購買之前。一覘新福特之究竟如何。而當陳出之時則購買之情勢又當恢復矣。苟此言而確。則福特新車問世之時。可令一般營業。均得增進也。　　通用汽車公司近設一種銷售組織、以銷售及製造聨合於一起、其所關者爲中價汽車之璧克·哇爾特司麻皮而。及鮑恩台克等是也。克雷斯勒之潑萊茅斯汽車、於四月三日出世。司蒂倍克及搿萊哈姆潘兩家。均稱售賣方面。甚爲得手。故各種新車之前途咸甚光明耳。　　新福特車Ｖ八者每小時可行七十五英里。四汽缸者每小時可行六十五英里。至其引擎構造方面之特色。亦有可爲介紹者。如無聲同發變速。無聲齒輪。引擎橡皮之隔離。下行化油器及化油靜默器。自動火花管理。隔膜式喞筒。使燃料由後部之油櫃衝出。此外尚有柔性横置之半懸彈簧。新式之尾彈簧。自動校正雙動式减震器。大號四輪制車。新式電接鋼輻車輪。具有大形之轂。轂帽。及大輪胎。新車所用橡皮之處甚爲廣汔。車架及行動齒輪之彈簧鈎連。及吸震環鍊等處。俱用橡皮隔離。以减震勢。車身與車架之間。亦以橡皮爲墊。</p>
<h3>交通器具流線化左</h3>
<p>▲動力世界的一個大革命　　假定你駕着現時習用的汽車疾馳於大道上。每小時行六十英里。又假設你的汽車突然改變了一下。牠的發動機移到了後方去。平直的放熱器削成了圓形。車頭燈和防衝器都縮在平滑圓凸的前頭部裏面。四角方方的車後部曳長而拖着一條尖長的尾巴。　　現在。看看你的速度計。雖然你並没有將加速器推進一釐一毫。你的車行速率已由每小時六十英里增加到七十五英里了。同時車行速率雖增加。而汽油消耗量則絶未增加。　　這種理想的改革便是（流線化）（Streamlining）的效果之一。所謂（流線）｜讀者大槪已經知道吧｜就是流體（如水及空氣）流動的路線。（流線化）云者。就是（將行動物體的外廓範成一種式樣。使流體得以暢流無阻。因而减少其阻力）之謂。　　如果一輛汽車曾經適當的流線化。每加侖汽油可行三十五至四十英里。至少要比用舊式汽車時的哩程加多一倍。現在的汽車大都有方形的背和許多突出的部分。這些都足以阻碍空氣的暢流。因而使汽車受到極大的阻力。　　最近美國有一種（淚珠式）汽車（“Ｔear-drop”car）出現。引起了一般人的注意與批評。大家以爲下墜的淚珠或雨滴是完全流線化的形態。美國標準局氣體力學專家德立敦博士。（Dr·H·L·Dryden）獨不謂然。他以爲一般人未免過於重視涙珠形而忽視了其他形態。（其實）他説。（凡没有足以引起逆漩的稜角的任何形體。都可説是流綫化的。從流綫的觀點説。那（涙珠）形不一定是最好的形態）。德氏又稱。局部的或表面的流綫化。（如將方邊改成圓邊）不能發生效果。所有自動車必須依照從實騐解來的原理加以改造。　　博士又説。一般汽車駕駛者多不知道普通汽車的最高速度係受空氣阻力的限制。當車行至每小時四十或五十英里以上的速度時。風的阻力變成了唯一的障碍物。所以把這阻力减小也就是把速度相當的增高。流綫化的應用可以把這阻力减去一半。　　德立敦博士更發表一種卓見。謂現在所稱流綫化的汽車。固然能以一加侖汽油行加倍的路程。然其所受阻力尚十倍於完全流綫化的汽車·最高標準的獲得有待於來日。到那時一加侖汽油當可行馳一百英里或以上了。　　汽車的流綫化。除形式的改造外。尚包含多種根本的改造。如引擎的移到座位後面。座位的降低。車身横斷面積的縮</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>小等等。流綫化的結果將使駕駛汽車一事更爲舒適而經濟。因爲汽車各部的構造是簡單化了。又當汽車行馳的時候。由於空氣暢流的結果。可免塵土的飛揚於車後。　　美國加利福尼亞州現在至少已有六條運貨汽車路上的運貨汽車改成流綫形式了。結果是。牠們能夠載運達到法定重量限度的貨物。而汽油消耗量所增無幾。在德國的大道上。流綫化的汽車已經是數見不鮮。在英國也漸漸可以見到流綫化的汽車了。不久以前白尼爵士（SirDenistounBuroey）的飛船式汽車初次出現於英國的道路上。羣衆看見了那打成一片。富有曲綫美的機器。無不驚奇不止。那車雖祗有二十二匹馬力。然據馬路實騐所示。竟能達到每小時八十英里的速度。在其他各國。汽車的流綫化受到同樣的注意與歡迎。（未完）消息</p>
<h3>道奇新車特色一斑影呆</h3>
<p>道奇車之在汽車界也。向來以物質良好而著名。他如製造之精良。車輛之可靠。外觀之美麗。皆爲社會人士所贊美者也。一言以蔽之。道奇車之一切。均較各種車輛爲優。固爲汽車界所公認者也。最近上海方面。運到八缸·六缸·道奇新車不少。故我人將此種新車。逐一加以研究。則道奇新車。自有特殊之優點。此固無可疑義者也。窮源追本。道奇兄弟汽車公司。其初以製造闊邊堅靱之小汽車而著名。彼時此種小車。銷路之發達。竟得未曾有。此後逐年有新車之介紹。問世於汽車市場。大得車主之悦意。迄於今日。道奇車之價值。已爲同業之冠矣。　　道奇汽車。以構造精密而見稱於汽車市場。上文已言之矣。然一九三二式新車。構造方面。亦根據前例。不少改變。且速率之增加。安全之增進。外觀之改美。更非歷年新車所能及也。昔日製造車輛之時。工程方面。精益求精。不遺餘而力。今年之新車。内部構造。更見注意。舉凡昔日優點。目前全數保存。而對於修飾方面。今日更見精良。是故道奇新車其在今日。已成最完美之汽車。　　經售道奇新車者。爲中國汽車公司。購車之人。不拘日夜。均可前往試車。車主一經嘗試。道奇車之優點。不難立見。如自動齧合子。無聲齒輪。以及活輪等。更爲主要之優點也。至於力量之濃厚。尤屬得未曾有。不拘六缸·八缸·在難行之道路上。運用驚人之推進桿。亦可得最快之速率。以馬力而言。猶如天馬行空。隨處可以活躍。不拘在鄉村或城市街道之上行車之時。均可聲息全無也。即用最高之擋排。亦無震盪之虚。　　自動齧合子。完全與活輪系統合作。活輪採取雙用式。用以處置齧合子也。無聲齒輪亦爲優點之一。運用之時。在任何環境之下。全無聲息。此外如有氣温證明器之水力制動機。亦爲最新裝置。車身用整塊鋼鐵鑄成。故可增加車輛之堅固程度。蓋任何震力。均不能破壞車身也。車架形如橋樑。是故行駛路上。亦可作競賽汽車之用也。用第二擋排。每小時速率。亦可達五十哩。綜上所述。道奇新車。其優點如何。想讀者亦不難洞悉。是以自新車問世以來。不數月間。已風行全球矣。</p>
<h3>惠廉斯阿韋蘭之新紀錄</h3>

<h3>Looking Out Towards Shanhaiguan and Beyond the Pass</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement has just been signed. However, the atmosphere at Yuguan has suddenly turned critical. Recently, the Japanese troops stationed in Yuguan have used the excuse of exercises to provoke us, revealing their intention to invade Yuguan, control Beijing and Tianjin, guard our gateway, and sever connections between inside and outside the Pass, so as to dedicate themselves to settling the overall situation in the Northeast. This has become crystal clear.</p>
<p>From the September 18th Incident to the abandonment of Jinzhou, the people of our nation have strained their necks looking north. They are both indignant at the arrogance of the powerful neighbor and resentful of the cowardice of those who did not resist. Bearing sorrow and enduring pain, their burning blood and anger have long been uncontrollable. After the January 28th Incident recurred, Shanghai also fell into the hands of the Japanese army. However, apart from a few who voluntarily and heroically resisted, other soldiers still adopted an attitude of watching the fire from the other side of the river, not rising up together to actively defend against the enemy, thus being defeated individually by the Japanese army. All these facts are indeed enough to make the people of the nation feel heartbroken and unable to forget. Now Yuguan is again in a state of emergency. What will the central government do? Will those who bear the heavy responsibility of defending the country and guarding the land order a retreat again?</p>
<p>According to Yuguan garrison commander Brigade Commander He Zhuguo, he is determined to defend it to the death and coexist with the First Pass under Heaven. How heroic are these words. The people of our nation have all heard them. We recognize Yuguan as our important gateway. If Yuguan is lost, then North China will be completely controlled by others. Therefore, at this critical moment, the authorities must not adopt an attitude of not actively preparing, making one mistake after another, causing the strategic pass to fall into enemy hands again. They should gather the strength of the entire nation to jointly resist, and absolutely not allow another inch of our territory to be lost. If they still verbally claim resistance but secretly watch and wait, then they are sincerely deceiving and harming the nation. In other words, they are willingly selling out the Northeast. A few days ago, Zhang Xueliang requested instructions from the central government, and the central government replied with defending the country and guarding the land. Zhang also expressed his compliance. Our people earnestly hope that these back-and-forth telegrams will no longer be merely a kind of official formality to deceive the people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast are still struggling arduously. We mentally believe that the Northeast has not yet been completely lost and the puppet state of Manchukuo has not yet been firmly established because of the existence of these volunteer armies. The isolated troops outside the Great Wall are fighting hard, their spirit swallowing rivers and mountains, their righteousness reaching the heavens. However, since the Shanghai situation was settled and the ceasefire agreement was signed, the central government has already put (recovering lost territory) (punishing the puppet state) behind them. The people have also largely forgotten the trauma of the past and returned to the path of ease and comfort. Alas. Can we bear to let the 476,000 square miles of the Northeast be lost from our national territory? Can we bear to let the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast continue to groan in the tragic situation of deep water and scorching fire?</p>
<p>This time, a sudden great change has occurred in Japan, clearly showing the rising tide of Japanism (fascist forces). Its policy of aggression against China will become increasingly rigid, which can be known without divination. The situation in Yuguan may erupt at any time. If the people of the nation do not urgently seek a way to deal with it, then the outbreak of disaster will be truly unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Political Turmoil Brewing in Japan</h3>
<p>Suzuki Succeeds Inukai Tsuyoshi as President of the Seiyukai. Military Seeks Supra-Party Cabinet. Tokyo Uneasy, Exchange Closed. Interior Minister Suzuki.</p>
<h3>Appointed President of the Seiyukai</h3>
<p>Tokonami Faction Gains Understanding. Reuters, Tokyo, 17th. Interior Minister Suzuki has been elected President of the Seiyukai. He will convene a general meeting of Seiyukai members this afternoon to hold a formal inauguration ceremony. The only one who competed with Suzuki for the presidency this time was Tokonami Takejiro. It is widely believed that Suzuki will not only succeed Inukai as President of the Seiyukai but also succeed him as Prime Minister. Suzuki is very popular among the leaders of the Seiyukai and has the highest support. Suzuki is 64 years old this year, studied law in his youth, served as Chief Judge of the Tokyo District Court, went abroad in 1908 to investigate the situation of justice, and served as Vice Minister of Justice six years later, and then promoted to Minister of Justice. In March of this year, the cabinet history moved people to choose Suzuki to succeed Takahashi as Interior Minister.</p>
<p>Far East Agency, Tokyo, 17th. After Inukai Tsuyoshi, President of the Japanese Seiyukai, was assassinated, the Seiyukai held a series of meetings yesterday with party members of the House of Representatives and executive meetings to discuss the issue of the successor president. Because the struggle between Suzuki and Tokonami was fierce, it was not easy to reach a result in the meeting place, so a committee was formed to conduct an out-of-meeting understanding movement. Because Takahashi Korekiyo expressed his refusal to be elected, Mochizuki and others tried to persuade the anti-Suzuki faction, asking various factions to consider the position of the party due to the deteriorating environment and not to go to extremes. The understanding movement was quite effective in the evening, and the Tokonami faction expressed its willingness to step down. Therefore, the general meeting of party members passed the election of Suzuki Kisaburo as the successor president at 9:00 a.m. today. Suzuki formally expressed his acceptance of the election on the spot and decided to visit Tokonami in the afternoon to ask for his support.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 17th. At 3:30 p.m. today, the general meeting of members of the Seiyukai was held at the headquarters, with more than 300 members of both houses attending. Chairman Kuhara of the General Affairs Department unanimously decided to elect Suzuki as the new president. Suzuki delivered a speech on the spot, saying that at this important moment for the country, with the help of everyone, he would work hard in the party to live up to the expectations of the people. Seiyukai's new president Suzuki.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 17th. Regarding Interior Minister Suzuki's succession to the presidency of the Seiyukai, the Democratic Constitutional Party observes as follows: Interior Minister Suzuki's appointment as the successor president is due to the fact that Tokonami Takejiro knows that today's situation is impossible without cooperation and declares his support for Suzuki. However, the definite opposition between the Tokonami and Suzuki factions has been going on for a long time, and it is doubtful whether it can be completely dissolved as a result, because the seed of the dispute has not yet been removed. Saionji.</p>
<h3>Quietly Watching the Political Situation Unfold</h3>
<p>Trip to Tokyo Suddenly Postponed. Dentsu, Tokyo, 17th. Saionji, who lives in Okitsu, suddenly postponed his trip to Tokyo tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. Saionji has had leg neuralgia for the past two or three days, but it does not hinder his trip to Tokyo. At this important time, Saionji rejects the strong will of the military and does not adhere to the constitutional normal way theory. It is thought that he is temporarily quietly watching the changes in the political situation and then taking measures, so he suddenly postponed his trip to Tokyo. Therefore, the changes in the political circles today and tomorrow are worthy of attention. Japanese militarists.</p>
<h3>Promote a Transcendent Cabinet</h3>
<p>See National Interests Above All Else. Gaining Sympathy from a Portion of the Public. Araki Visits Saionji for Understanding. Indicates No Cooperation with Party Government. Reuters, Tokyo, 17th. While the saying that Interior Minister Suzuki is forming a Seiyukai cabinet is gaining momentum, the military has already indicated today that it will not participate in any cabinet other than a transcendent cabinet based on national interests. Vice Chief of Staff Masaki met with Army Minister Araki this morning, saying that if the new cabinet is a political party cabinet, the army does not want to recommend the Army Minister, because the party is in difficulty and there must be a transcendent cabinet. According to the Japanese constitution, the Army Minister must be a current military officer, so if the army does not agree, the cabinet cannot be formed. Therefore, it is widely believed that Army Minister Araki is persuading Saionji to advocate the organization of a national government that transcends political parties.</p>
<p>Dentsu, 17th. Army Minister Araki, representing the entire army, directly visited Elder Saionji to state his opinion, saying that in view of the current domestic situation, formal party politics can hardly save the country's emergency. Therefore, he is absolutely opposed to the emergence of an established party cabinet and must organize a unanimous national cabinet to cope. He earnestly requested that Lord Yuan consider carefully and take good care of it. This will cause great waves in future political changes, so all parties are paying close attention to this.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th. The selection of the new cabinet will not be decided before May 20, because Duke Saionji must arrive in Tokyo on the 19th. Members of the Seiyukai Diet held a general meeting this afternoon and unanimously elected Suzuki as president to fill the vacancy left by Inukai Tsuyoshi. Now that the military is unwilling to recommend the Army Minister, Suzuki's formation of a cabinet may not be a reality. According to well-informed sources, the military's advocacy of organizing a national cabinet seems appropriate, because it is now clear that no political party cabinet can gain sufficient respect and trust to cope with the current national crisis. The military and the public do not agree with the means of the youth radical faction, but although the main newspapers and leaders strongly criticize their actions as being out of line, they express sympathy for their will. Therefore, those who acted violently on Sunday seem to have achieved at least one of their goals, that is, to create a situation and force the country to recognize the need to organize a national cabinet and see national interests above all else. If a national cabinet is organized, then Hiranuma, president of the Kokuhonsha, will serve as prime minister, the unexpected rise of.</p>
<h3>Hiranuma Support Movement</h3>
<p>Promotes the So-Called (Japanism). Relying on the Kokuhonsha as its Backing. Opposes Party Politics. Advocates Strong Foreign Policy. Disappointed Politicians and Militarists Unite. Reuters, Tokyo, 12th. Although the Japanese political situation now seems to be calm, undercurrents are still brewing. Anyone who pays attention to the situation can see it. The current silence is a sign that a storm is about to break out. Each party is working actively to consolidate its position so that it can compete for power at the appropriate time. Hiranuma Kiichiro, Vice President of the Privy Council, is now using the powerful Kokuhonsha as a medium to attack the corruption of politics and advocate a strong foreign policy. Army Minister Araki greatly supports him and cooperates with him. However, Araki and Hiranuma both stated that they do not agree with the stick policy. In fact, this movement is quite similar to Germany's National Socialism, not Italy's stick policy. If there is no way to name it now, it may be called Japanism. Hiranuma believes that many Diet members are self-serving and corrupt. Such a Diet cannot truly represent the people. Therefore, he leads Kokuhonsha members to hold meetings frequently and distribute leaflets to members of retired soldiers' organizations and youth organizations across the country, actively publicizing the disadvantages of party politics. Although Hiranuma and nationalistic figures such as Cabinet Secretary Mori are extremely inclined to nationalism on the surface, they are much milder than those on the far right. The far right hopes that the Kokuhonsha will be its pioneer to realize its dream of a second restoration of imperial power. The relationship between the Japanese far right and the nationalistic faction is like the relationship between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in the late Russian Empire, except that the purpose of its movement is to consolidate the throne rather than weaken imperial power. There are other leaders in the anti-party politics movement, (1) Mr. Akamatsu, the leader of the system that recently broke away from the Social Democratic Constitutional Party and is working on national society, (2) Mr. Nakano, a former member of the Democratic Constitutional Party, Nakano withdrew from the party when the Minseito cabinet was overthrown due to the issue of Interior Minister Adachi last December and advocated the organization of a coalition cabinet. Nakano is inclined to nationalism and has ambition. It is said that he is currently in contact with Akamatsu and his national socialist faction and other disappointed politicians to cooperate. Although the leaders of the above-mentioned factions are not united, their political views have many points in common, because they all oppose the current party system and their national thought is very strong. Their political claims are to support the Japanese Emperor and overthrow communism and other left-leaning doctrines. As for capitalism, all factions oppose it, but the degree of their opposition is different. The recent expansion of the right-leaning reactionary elements in Japan, especially the Kokuhonsha of nationalism, and the increase in party members cannot be denied. It is especially noteworthy that important speech organs that have always opposed changing the existing political system, such as the Asahi Shimbun and Nichinichi Shimbun, are vigorously criticizing the corruption and incompetence of political parties, and know only selfishness, so that the potential power of reactionary elements is gradually spreading. There are even more severe warnings to both the Minseito and Seiyukai parties, saying that if political parties are blindly ignorant and only know about the party and ignore national interests, then the future changes are easy to imagine. However, after careful examination of the domestic situation, if the parties know to rein in on the brink, this crisis can still pass safely.</p>
<h3>Attached Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Essay</h3>
<p>Before Inukai was assassinated, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an article stating that political turmoil was about to begin, detailing various activities to support the Hiranuma cabinet, which was quite radical. It can be seen that the sudden outbreak of this coup was a matter of great research. A special translation is provided below. Taking advantage of the current political turmoil and the infighting between the ruling and opposition parties, Hiranuma Kiichiro, who is trying to gain power, is taking noteworthy action. With the Kokuhonsha as its central force, it has vaguely begun a major political activity. Mr. Hiranuma has the military as his background, and his claim for a strong foreign policy with Army Minister Araki are of the same mind. He criticizes the existing political parties, despises the interests of the country, and uses only party interests and strategies as tools. The acquisition of seats through bribery elections cannot represent true public opinion. Therefore, he spares no sacrifice to try to overthrow the abuses of the party. Now Hiranuma is promoting the implementation of his claims, using the name of the Kokuhonsha to lobby important cities across the country and unite with retired soldiers' groups and youth groups to expand the propaganda movement. As in the past, the speeches of the Kokuhonsha and Army Minister Araki in Osaka are enough to represent the purpose of the organization. The strangest thing is that Mori, the Secretary-General of the government, also expressed sympathy for the Kokuhonsha movement. As a result of repeated consultations between Army Minister Araki and the leaders of the army, powerful comrades, such as Izawa Taki, Vice Chairman of the House of Peers, Nagai Ryutaro of the Minseito, and Prince Konoe Fumimaro, Vice Chairman of the House of Peers, and powerful figures in the financial world, are gradually leaning towards the Hiranuma support movement, all advocating the necessity of breaking the status quo and organizing a strong cabinet. Hiranuma himself personally came forward to visit Saionji in Okitsu, seeking Lord Yuan's understanding. Saionji is worried about the future of the political situation because the military's advocacy of supporting Hiranuma is causing various strategies to break the status quo. He is currently taking a calm attitude and must carefully consider the aftermath before taking action. However, on the other hand, to the movement aimed at supporting Mr. Hiranuma, such as the new party movement of Mr. Nakano Seigo's faction, which is labeled with social nationalism, the split of the Social Democratic Party in the proletarian camp, and the internal resistance of the Masses Party are also very sympathetic. Therefore, the trend of the Hiranuma support movement is becoming more and more apparent. It is expected that a considerable wave will be stirred up in the political situation before and after the end of the Second Extraordinary Diet. However, Secretary-General Mori's endorsement of the campaign has been warned by Interior Minister Suzuki, Education Minister Hatoyama, and other friends. Therefore, Secretary-General Mori has carefully considered his current position and changed his previous attitude. However, in today's situation, the Hiranuma support movement is still moving forward bravely regardless of the extent of Secretary-General Mori's efforts. (According to the author, Hiranuma and Araki are working together and have the support of Nakano, Akamatsu, Konoe, Izawa, Nagai, Oya, and Mori. Their power is strong. Now that Inukai has been assassinated and neither the Seiyukai nor the Minseito has anyone to succeed him, it is very possible that Hiranuma will form a cabinet.)</p>
<p>Hiranuma's brief history. After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, Hiranuma was appointed as a prosecutor. In September of the 4th year of Showa, when Count Yamamoto took office as the cabinet after the earthquake, Hiranuma was appointed Minister of Justice. After resigning, he served as a director of Waseda University and concurrently as president. He then served as a councilor of the Privy Council and is currently the Vice President of the same court. During the Wakatsuki cabinet, he also served as the President of the Legislative Council and the President of the Shrine System Investigation Committee and the Religious System Investigation Committee. In the 15th year of Taisho, he was awarded the title of Baron. Hiranuma is now nominated to be the next Prime Minister of Japan and is closely related to the military and fascists. He will be one of the leaders of the Japanese Fascist Party in the future. (Hualian News Agency). Seiyukai.</p>
<h3>Will Continue to Form a New Cabinet</h3>
<p>Get Through the Parliamentary Difficulties. There will be major changes in the selection of cabinet members. Foreign Minister Yoshizawa is determined to be difficult to retain. Far East Agency, Tokyo, 17th. The issue of the successor president of the Japanese Seiyukai has been resolved through the understanding movement of various parties. It has been decided that Suzuki will succeed. Since the Japanese cabinet has the upcoming extraordinary Diet and the Seiyukai has a total of 303 members in the House of Representatives, accounting for the vast majority of the total number of members, it is imperative that the Seiyukai continue to form a cabinet to avoid the dissolution of the Diet. Tomorrow, after Saionji arrives in Tokyo in the morning and observes the situation, it is expected that he will immediately request the Emperor to select Suzuki as Prime Minister to cope with the situation. However, it is widely believed that the Japanese fascist movement has become a prairie fire. This terrorist act was committed by this faction. Even if the Seiyukai continues to form a cabinet, due to objective circumstances and its internal situation, it no longer has the strength of the Inukai president's era. Therefore, it is expected that it will not be able to cope with major difficulties, especially that it will be unable to stop the planning of the fascist movement of the navy and army. Therefore, the Japanese political unrest will inevitably have major fluctuations during the transition of the extraordinary Diet.</p>
<p>Far East Agency, Tokyo, 17th. After the successor president of the Japanese Seiyukai is determined, it has become an inevitable fact that the Japanese cabinet will continue to be formed by the president of the Seiyukai. Therefore, Suzuki is already looking for candidates for cabinet members so that he can take office immediately after the great order is issued. The approximate list of candidates is as follows: Former cabinet members Tokonami Takejiro, Qin Tuoxiang, and Kawamura Justice Minister will continue to remain in office. Seiyukai Secretary-General Mori, Secretary-General Yamaguchi, and Matsunaga will all join the cabinet. Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo will resign, and the successor has not yet been determined. It is most likely that Deputy Chief of Staff Masaki will be promoted to the position of Army Minister. The Navy Minister will be succeeded by General Okada.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 17th. If the Japanese Emperor orders Suzuki, the new president of the Seiyukai, to organize the successor cabinet, how will the cabinet members change? This is what is generally speculated, but according to the following distribution, it seems most appropriate, that is, Finance Minister Takahashi and Tokonami must remain in office. Tuomu Minister Qin Fengzhu, Minister of Justice Kawamura Takeji, Minister of Commerce and Industry Maeda Yonezo, the above are definitely retained. Minister of Agriculture and Industry Yamamoto, Minister of Communications Mitsudo, the above are generally retained. Minister of Finance Katsuda Takeji, Minister of Railways Mori Kaku, Minister of Education Akita Kiyoshi or Shimada Toshio, Minister of Interior Hatoyama Ichiro, etc. As for Foreign Minister Yoshizawa, it will be difficult to retain him. The voices for his successors are Yoshida Shigeru, Hirota Hiroki, Nagai Matsuzo, and Mori Kaku.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 17th. Regarding the issue of the successor cabinet, the establishment of the Suzuki cabinet has become stronger this morning. However, when it is established, it is expected that there will be considerable reorganization of the members of the new cabinet, because Finance Minister Takahashi and Minister of Railways Tokonami have both firmly declined to be reappointed, and Interior Minister Suzuki himself will be promoted to Prime Minister, so the three provinces of Interior, Finance, and Railways must find successors. It is said that Katsuda Takeji is the most likely candidate for Minister of Finance. In addition, Mori Kaku, Shimada Matsuo, and others all hope to join the cabinet. Yamaguchi Yoshiichi and Matsuno Tsuruhei are the most popular for the position of Cabinet Secretary-General, and Yamazaki Tatsunosuke is the most promising for the position of Director of the Legislation Bureau. In short, there will be a major reorganization of the Suzuki cabinet.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 17th. Due to this coup, it is worth paying attention to whether the extraordinary Diet can be held as scheduled. However, according to the government's interpretation, it is believed that if the Diet can be convened as expected on the 23rd, it is not necessary to postpone the request to hold the opening ceremony and to stop the meeting and re-promulgate the edict. Therefore, it is generally believed that the opening ceremony will be postponed.</p>
<p>Far East Agency, Tokyo, 17th. The date of the Japanese Imperial Conference is approaching in an instant, but the cabinet has not yet been formed. No matter which faction rises to form a cabinet in the future, after the Imperial Conference is held on the 23rd, it will inevitably request a recess for a certain period of time in order to establish a government countermeasure from it. Democratic Constitutional Party.</p>
<h3>Supports Parliamentary Politics</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 17th. Duke Saionji will enter Tokyo from Okitsu on the 18th. Regarding the Imperial answer to the successor cabinet, the President of the current Seiyukai has decided that Interior Minister Suzuki will succeed. The opposition party, the Democratic Constitutional Party, has expressed a public attitude from the standpoint of supporting parliamentary politics and opposing the fascist movement, and has decided to maintain the Seiyukai cabinet. Therefore, the opportunity for the establishment of the Suzuki cabinet is gradually becoming more powerful. Although the movement to support Hiranuma Kiichiro in forming a cabinet has considerable power, the result of the establishment of the Hiranuma cabinet would be to recognize a powerful coup d'état. Senior officials are quite worried about this, and many parties do not support it, so the possibility of its realization is very small. (Coupdetat comes from the French Coup d'etat, meaning coup).</p>
<p>Far East Agency, Tokyo, 17th. After Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated, the fascist faction actively attempted to overthrow party politics. The Democratic Constitutional Party held an executive meeting this morning and decided to fully support party politics as the principle of Japanese politics.</p>
<h3>Inukai's Pre-Established Will</h3>
<p>Unable to End His Reign Politically. Had Foresight. Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 17th. Prime Minister Inukai fought hard during his lifetime to establish party politics. The people called him (the God of Constitutional Government). The Prime Minister knew early on about today's misfortune. Before taking office as the President of the Seiyukai in the fourth year of Showa, he made a will, the contents of which are as follows, (1) The funeral must be simple, and the farewell ceremony will only be held by close relatives, (2) Only the words (Inukai Tsuyoshi) are engraved on the tombstone, without recording ranks and titles, etc. On the side is engraved, born on April 20, the second year of Ansei, a native of Tingshi, Bitchu, (3) The cemetery is in Tokyo City.</p>
<h3>Three Assailants of Power Plants Arrested</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 17th. On the evening of the 15th, someone attacked the power plants of the Tokyo Electric Power Company and the city's electric power company, plunging Tokyo into darkness. Since the incident, the Metropolitan Police Department has been strictly arresting the perpetrators. As a result, it was learned that it was done by the Aikyo Society outside Mito City. Its leader is Kozauburo Tachibana. However, Tachibana has fled to Manchuria and his current location is unknown. Three of the perpetrators were arrested in the city on the evening of the 16th, and there are also clues to the remaining five or six accomplices. They are expected to be arrested soon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th. Those who attacked the power plants on Sunday have been arrested. It is now known that these young people are all followers of Tachibana, a farmer in a certain county. Tachibana runs a private school in the countryside, with few disciples. He also advocates the so-called patriotism by violent means and advocates distributing land equally to farmers. Therefore, he has used a system of collective farming in farming in the countryside. Since the case, the person has disappeared. It is now believed that he has fled to Manchuria.</p>
<h3>Tokyo People Uneasy</h3>
<p>Stock Exchange Still Not Open. People's News Agency, Tokyo, 17th. Tokyo still feels extremely uneasy today. The situation has made little progress. Although the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced yesterday that it would open today, the board of directors convened a meeting at 8:00 a.m. this morning and decided to suspend it again due to the people's unrest. The intense infighting within the Seiyukai for the new president, coupled with the fact that the new cabinet has not yet been formed, is a major cause of people's instability.</p>
<h3>Prospects for Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Military in Power Will Be More Rigid Towards China. This newspaper's special dispatch from Peiping on the 17th, the envoy's message, this time Inukai's assassination was completely because the Japanese military was dissatisfied with Inukai's diplomatic strategy and the Shanghai Agreement. The Japanese military advocated the Asian Monroe Doctrine under the slogan of supporting the Japanese Constitution. The prospects for Sino-Japanese relations are feared to become even darker.</p>
<h3>English Newspaper Comments on Japanese Political Turmoil</h3>
<p>The Rise of Nationalistic Movements  -  A Russo-Japanese War May Ultimately Be Inevitable  -  ▲ Reuters, London, 17th. The question of whether the extreme nationalistic movement in Japan, which led to the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, was inspired by Hitlerism or Fascism, or arose from the Japanese government's moderate stance on the Sino-Japanese dispute in Shanghai, is now receiving national attention in Britain. The Manchester Guardian carries an editorial today stating that Japan has reached a critical point in its internal development. Japan's political development has ultimately failed to keep pace with its economic development, as Japan, though a highly organized industrial nation, still has a government with many feudalistic characteristics. The paper also discussed Russo-Japanese relations, stating that if the current internal strife in Japan results in the establishment of a military dictatorship, a Russo-Japanese war may be unavoidable. The former Morning Post correspondent in Japan, Bickering, also published an article in this morning's paper, stating that the trend in Japanese domestic politics is strongly towards democracy. Even the Emperor's authority is almost religiously sacred, and the Japanese people will never tolerate a system containing overt despotism. The Times carried an editorial discussing the future of Manchuria, stating that Manchuria is racially and geographically a part of China. Japanese military and government officials should realize that assuming full responsibility for the area will inevitably lead to a heavy burden. The paper hopes that the Lytton Commission can propose a solution satisfactory to both countries. It also stated that Japanese troops in their operational areas will sooner or later inevitably clash with Russian troops. Although Manchuria may shine brightly in the future through Japanese development, it should be known that it is currently full of difficulties and dangers.</p>
<h3>Ten American Warships Withdraw</h3>
<p>The American destroyers stationed in Shanghai, Nos. 218, 219, 222, and 224, as well as submarines Nos. 36, 37, 39, and 41, were led by the cruiser USS Chaumont and withdrew yesterday due to the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai and the lack of need to remain there. They have already departed Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Takeover Committee Took Over Dacha Yesterday</h3>
<p>Joint Committee Oversight  -  Japanese Troops Leave the Territory in the Afternoon  -  The Security Brigade Takes Over Defense  -  The Japanese troops stationed in Dacha have, as agreed, completely withdrawn before 1:00 PM yesterday. The takeover committee on our side sent takeover specialists Tao Xiaojie and Lu Fengpu to handle the takeover matters the day before. The takeover was completely completed at around 1:00 PM yesterday. However, the situation in that area after the disaster is bleak, and post-disaster matters need to be urgently addressed. Therefore, people in that area have already organized the Baoshan War Disaster Relief Association to focus on carrying out reconstruction work. The details are recorded as follows:  -  ▲ Investigation of Japanese Troops Stationed in Dacha  -  The total number of Japanese troops stationed in Dacha reached 3,000. Their defensive locations were divided into five places: (1) Baohua Temple, (2) Qianxi Elementary School, (3) Su family residence, (4) Sun Jingxi residence, (5) Pushan Villa. There were infantry, cavalry, artillery, and horse-drawn mountain artillery teams, and everything that should be there was there. When the front-line combat was intense, that place was the Japanese army's rear headquarters. Its headquarters was stationed in Baohua Temple, and it was presided over by Xing Xianyi, the first battalion commander of the 7th Infantry Regiment, who served as the commander of the Japanese military garrison in Dachang Town.  -  ▲ Takeover Committee Departs  -  Since the Japanese side decided to completely withdraw its troops stationed there by 1:00 PM on the 17th, the takeover committee on our side, in order to negotiate properly in advance, sent special envoy Tao Xiaojie, Lu Fengpu, the second district chief of Baoshan County, and others as takeover committee members to Dachang the day before to discuss takeover procedures. Tao and others arrived there at around 10:00 AM the day before and immediately visited Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi and Lieutenant Kitamura Masae to discuss takeover matters. Tao and others also went to Luodian that night to notify our police force that they must arrive in Dachang completely before 10:00 AM yesterday in order to take over defense immediately after the Japanese troops withdrew. Tao and others stayed overnight in Luodian that night and set off for Dachang with the Capital Security Brigade responsible for the takeover at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning.  -  ▲ Our Police Force Arrives at the Field  -  The force responsible for taking over defense in Dachang this time was a company of the Capital Security Brigade, totaling 150 people, led by company commander Zhu Huang. When they arrived at the Beishihe Motor Road Bridge in Dachang Town, they temporarily camped there. Takeover committee members Tao and Lu first went to the Japanese headquarters to notify our police force that they had arrived and to discuss takeover procedures. Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi decided to completely withdraw the Japanese troops before 1:00 PM in the afternoon. After 1:00 PM, our police force would be responsible for maintaining law and order, and it was decided that the Longlin Pagoda Temple in Dachang Town would be the location for our police force to station. After the negotiations were completed, Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi personally accompanied Tao and Lu to the motor road bridge to greet our police force.  -  ▲ Japanese Troops Withdraw in Batches  -  The Japanese troops in Dachang were sparse in number. They began to withdraw in batches from 9:00 AM yesterday morning. All horse artillery teams were completely withdrawn before 11:00 AM. Infantry battalions were also withdrawn in batches. Before 12:00 PM yesterday noon, more than 2,600 of the more than 3,000 troops stationed in Dachang had completed their withdrawal. The garrison locations, such as Qianxi Elementary School, Su family residence, Sun Jingxi residence, and Pushan Villa, had all been completely withdrawn. Only the Baohua Temple garrison headquarters still had more than 400 infantrymen stationed there for the final withdrawal.  -  ▲ Once a Misunderstanding Was Resolved  -  When our police force took over defense yesterday morning, Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi had a misunderstanding. When Xing Xianyi accompanied our takeover officials Tao and Lu to greet the Capital Security Brigade, Xing Xianyi suddenly expressed to committee members Tao and Zhu that the Capital Security Brigade's takeover was inconsistent with the agreed terms. The agreement stipulated that the withdrawn areas should be taken over by special police. The so-called special police referred to regular police. Now the takeover was by the Capital Security Brigade, which seemed to violate the agreement. At that time, the Japanese garrison commander spoke forcefully. After our special envoy Tao explained the meaning of special police, there was no stipulation about Beijing. After repeated explanations, Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi finally nodded without saying anything. He immediately led our police force to station in the Longlin Pagoda Temple in Dachang Town. Then the national flag carried by our security brigade began to fly over Dachang Town.  -  ▲ Joint Committee Oversight  -  Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops, according to the agreement, it must be supervised by the joint committee composed of China, Japan, and neutral countries. Therefore, when the Japanese troops withdrew from Dachang yesterday, military attachés from various countries on the joint committee and Japanese committee member Harada arrived at the Japanese garrison headquarters in Baohua Temple in Dachang at 12:15 PM. Our committee member Wen Yingyi arrived in Dachang at 12:30 PM and carefully inspected the town's surroundings. He then went to the Japanese garrison headquarters in Baohua Temple to meet with the Japanese military attachés and the military attachés from various countries. He was received by Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi, and they talked for a long time before ending at 1:15 PM. Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi immediately stood up and poured champagne, congratulating the military attachés from various countries, our committee member Wen Yingxing, and takeover committee members Tao and Lu. They then went outside to take several photos together. Finally, Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi and Japanese Lieutenant Adjutant Kitamura Masae also took a photo with the temple monk Zheng Yin to commemorate the occasion. It was already 1:30 PM. The last 400 infantrymen remaining in the temple had also completely withdrawn. Japanese military attaché Harada said goodbye first with the military attachés from neutral countries. Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi and Lieutenant Adjutant Kitamura Masae also shook hands and said goodbye to our committee members. At this point, the Japanese troops in Dachang had completely withdrawn.  -  ▲ Exchange of Documents for Japanese Troop Withdrawal  -  Before the Japanese troops withdrew, Japanese garrison commander Xing Xianyi, our takeover committee member Lu Fengpu, and Zhu Huang, the company commander of the Capital Security Brigade responsible for taking over Dachang, exchanged and signed documents as a ceremony of handover between the two parties. Each party held one copy of this exchange of documents. The original documents handed over to our side by the Japanese side are recorded as follows: (The commander of the Japanese garrison in Dachang handed over the land, buildings, materials, and security used by the Japanese army at 1:00 PM on May 17, Showa 7, and the committee member of the Republic of China takeover committee assumed responsibility for the protection and security of the people thereafter, and the Japanese army no longer bore any responsibility. Therefore, please committee members of the Republic of China confirm at 1:00 PM on May 17, the 21st year of the Republic of China, that the land, buildings, materials, and security used by the Japanese army near Dachang Town have been completely protected by the Japanese army, and after the Japanese army garrison commander in Dachang Town has handed over all the security, they will assume responsibility for the protection and security thereafter. The two parties have agreed and signed in Baohua Temple in Dachang Town. Japanese Army Garrison Commander in Dachang Town Xing Xianyi, Republic of China Takeover Committee Lu Fengpu, Capital Police Department Fourth Security Company Commander Zhu Huang.  -  ▲ Wen and Sun Inspect  -  Our committee member of the joint committee, Wen Yingxing, specially accompanied takeover committee members Lu Fengpu and Tao Xiaojie to Dachang Town to conduct a detailed inspection at around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. They inspected the entire town for a week and went to the Longlin Pagoda Temple, where our police force was stationed, to inquire about everything in detail. He returned to Shanghai at 2:15 PM. In addition, Sun Xiwen, the magistrate of Baoshan County, also went to Dachang in person at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to preside over the takeover matters and investigate the disaster situation to properly plan for post-disaster relief.</p>

<p>▲ Post-Disaster Matters in Dachang - The Dachang Town area covers 130 square miles, including 1 town and 28 villages, with more than 7,000 households and a population of more than 30,000. It is bordered by Baojia Bridge in the Zhenru District to the south, Miaoxing Town, Zhuyuan Dun, and Jinjia Wooden Bridge to the east, Nanxiang to the west, and Yuncao River to the north. The town is densely populated, with many shops and markets. When the Japanese army invaded, the area was the rear guard of our army, with more than 30,000 troops stationed there. Therefore, it attracted the attention of the Japanese, who sent bombers to drop bombs, destroying more than one-third of the town's houses. On March 1, after our army retreated to the rear defense, the area unfortunately fell under the iron heel of the Japanese army. Yesterday, during the takeover, the reporter from the China Eastern News Agency specially accompanied Wen Yingxing, our committee member of the joint committee, to inspect the broken walls and rubble, which were desolate at a glance. The once prosperous market had been reduced to rubble. According to takeover committee member Lu Fengpu, it is estimated that more than 30% of the houses in the area were bombed and destroyed, and more than 30% were burned after being occupied. The town suffered the most severely. However, when our army retreated, the residents fled one after another, so there were few who were killed. As for the villages, when the Japanese army set fire to the houses, those who escaped were brutally shot, and those who stayed were burned to death. The matter was so tragic that it was painful to hear. According to the current first-step investigation, more than 400 people have been killed. At the moment, the villagers are displaced and wandering, unable to return. The most urgent task is to handle post-disaster relief. Therefore, the Baoshan County War Disaster Relief Association has been launched to focus on handling local post-disaster matters. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has allocated 300,000 yuan to the three counties of Jiading, Taicang, and Baoshan for relief. Baoshan received 100,000, of which 30,000 has been designated for Dachang to carry out reconstruction work. However, the destroyed residential buildings and the planting of fields also need to be addressed urgently. Regarding agricultural relief, the provincial government has allocated 1,000 dan of cotton seeds, which have been distributed without remaining, but it is far from enough. The residents' houses have also been requested from the Shanghai Local Maintenance Association to raise donations to promote reconstruction as soon as possible. As for the rectification of roads and bridges, the dredging of city rivers, etc., the Construction Bureau has also been consulted to start separately. Before the Japanese army withdrew, they cut down many telegraph poles along the way. At this time of takeover, they should also be repaired immediately. In short, in the area of Dachang today, everything is waiting to be done, and it is really not allowed to delay. Mr. Lu also told reporters that Baohua Temple in that area is one of the major monasteries in Jiangsu Province, covering an area of 140 mu. Previously, our 78th Division was stationed there, so the enemy frequently bombed and dropped more than 100 bombs, all of which fell around the temple. The temple has remained intact to this day. According to the Japanese army after the incident, when the Japanese planes inspected in the sky, they looked at the temple from afar and saw it as a sea of smoke. When the bombs fell there, they were all blown away by the whirlwind, believing that the temple gods were uniquely spiritual. Therefore, after occupying it, although they used the temple as the garrison headquarters, they did not dare to destroy it. This is a near-myth, which may be credible and incredible. Before the Shanghai War, Dachang had only 12 county police officers, and everything in the area was maintained by the local security corps. Now the security corps members have been scattered, and it will take time to recover. The small number of 150 police officers seems to be insufficient to maintain it. It is planned to request the takeover committee to send more police force so that local law and order can be worry-free. ▲ Takeover Committee Press Release Yesterday, the Takeover Committee issued a press release announcing the takeover of Dachang Town, saying that Lu Fengpu, the second district chief of Baoshan, and special envoy Tao Xiaojie, returned to the committee this afternoon and reported that they had completely taken over Dachang Town at 2:00 PM today. All issues concerning the security and reorganization of the town after the takeover will be handled by the district chief, and he will urge the competent authorities to restore various businesses as soon as possible and start investigating the household registration at the same time. ▲ Gujia Town Has Been Taken Over The Takeover Committee received a report from Baoshan County Magistrate Sun yesterday, saying that according to the report, the Japanese troops in Gujia Town, which is under the jurisdiction of the third district of Liuhang in the county, withdrew on the 13th. The third team leader of the provincial police team, Zhao Zhiqin, was immediately dispatched, leading 10 long-term police officers, to meet with Chen Long, the acting director of the third sub-bureau, leading the police to the town, preparing until 12:30 PM, when the Japanese troops were completely withdrawn, and our police immediately entered and set up posts. ▲ Jiangqiao Has Also Been Taken Over The Municipal Public Security Bureau submitted to the Municipal Government yesterday, saying, "Submitting a document stating that the Japanese troops in Jiangqiao have withdrawn, and officials and police have been dispatched to restore the original state, and a document has been submitted to Your Excellency for review and record." According to the report of Bi Zhenhua, the director of the first office in the sixth district, "This office has found that the Shanghai War has ended, and the Japanese troops in the front are gradually withdrawing. The Japanese troops formerly stationed at the Jiangqiao Branch Office under the jurisdiction of this office completely withdrew at 3:00 PM on the 10th of this month. The inspector of the branch office, Yu Zuyou, contacted the gentlemen in the town to clean up the local post-disaster matters and ordered the inspector to lead the long-term police to Jiangqiao on the 12th to restore the original state and continue to work. In addition to reporting the details of cleaning up the post-disaster matters in another document, we should first report the restoration date to Your Excellency for review," etc. In addition to ordering the director of the office to supervise his subordinates to seriously clean up all post-disaster matters and report at any time, we should prepare a document and submit it, requesting Your Excellency to review and record. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu, Director of the Public Security Bureau Wen Yingxing. ▲ Scheduled Takeover of Baoshan The Takeover Committee also reported that Baoshan County Magistrate reported that on the afternoon of the 16th, he and Huo Shi, a special envoy of the committee, held a letter from Harada, a military attaché of the Japanese embassy, to Baoshan County to contact the Japanese troops stationed in the city to receive the city on a specific date. He met with Major General Maeda, the commander of the 6th Infantry Brigade of the Japanese Army, and Adjutant Uetani, who stated that the troops of the regiment planned to withdraw the troops stationed in Yangxing on the 25th of this month and then withdraw the troops stationed in Baoshan County on the 26th, asking our side to lead the police to each place the day before to prepare for the takeover. ▲ Contacting Yangxing for Takeover At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the Takeover Committee sent Wang Qingtao, the first district chief of Baoshan, and Liu Yumen, a special envoy of the committee, with a letter to Yangxing to contact the Japanese garrison stationed there to discuss takeover matters and detoured to Luodian to send a letter to the Baoshan County Magistrate to discuss everything. ▲ Collecting Firearms and Ammunition from the War Zone The Public Security Bureau issued a notice yesterday, saying, "For the sake of notice, it has been found that in the war zone, people who have picked up and collected firearms and ammunition are the bureau. In order to eliminate future troubles and dangers, the bureau has previously announced that the presentation of receipts and rewards has been filed. Now that the police power in northern Shanghai will be gradually restored, the loss and preservation of all firearms and ammunition must not be small. It is necessary to reissue the announcement. Anyone who has picked up firearms and ammunition must submit them to the local management office for verification and transfer within seven days from the date of the announcement. If anyone dares to conceal the report after the deadline, once it is verified or reported by someone, they will be charged with illegally possessing military firearms and will never be tolerated. All should abide by this order, be careful." Director Wen Yingxing. ▲ Jurisdiction of the Peace Police Regarding the jurisdiction of the peace police, Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government issued an order to Lu Luyun, the captain of the Peace Security Brigade, yesterday, saying, "For the sake of following the order, the security brigade should be controlled and dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. In addition to the separate order, this order should be obeyed." In addition, Director Wen Yingxing of the Public Security Bureau was ordered, saying, "For the sake of knowing the matter, all security brigades transferred from Beijing to Shanghai to take over the withdrawal area should be temporarily controlled and dispatched by the bureau. In addition to the separate order, this order should be obeyed." ▲ Letter Requesting the Return of Road Property Regarding the traffic on the two railway bureaus, due to the Japanese side's failure to return the Wusong Machine Factory and other properties as soon as possible, the two railway bureaus have not been able to complete the full line repair. Yu and Wen, our members of the joint committee, have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side has not given a definite answer. Therefore, Yu Hongjun specially sent a formal letter to the Japanese members yesterday, requesting the Japanese side to return the property of the two railways as soon as possible. The letter also solemnly stated that the Japanese side confirmed in the small committee of the ceasefire meeting that even in the garrison area, it should not hinder the traffic of the two railways. In addition, he also sent a letter to Mr. Ke Ninghan, the chairman of the meeting, requesting him to urge the Japanese side to return the road property as soon as possible. After our side sent the letter, Japanese committee member Murai, representing Okazaki, expressed to our side that the railway machine factory, etc., could be returned in a short period of time. ▲ Exchange of Living and Dead Prisoners The China Eastern News Agency reported that the Japanese authorities had previously requested our side to find a way to transport the remains of Japanese soldiers who had died in battle in Taicang and other places and were buried there back to Shanghai and hand them over to the Japanese side. Our side proposed exchange conditions, saying that after the remains of the Japanese soldiers were found, 38 of our captured soldiers must be released at the same time. The Japanese side immediately agreed. Now, the two Japanese soldiers buried outside the South Gate of Taicang have been found by the county and specially hired a steamship to transport them to Shanghai yesterday. Our side notified the Japanese authorities to send someone to receive them as soon as possible and release our 38 captured soldiers immediately.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Takeover Postponed</h3>
<p>▲ Delays in Welcoming Trains on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway ▲ Zhenru, which was originally notified by the Japanese side to withdraw on the 20th, but yesterday the Takeover Committee received a notice from the Japanese side that due to shipping reasons, the takeover schedule was changed, and Zhenru was changed to withdraw at 12:00 AM on the 23rd, and the western part of the Jiangwan Town Railway was returned first at 11:00 AM on the 19th, so the Takeover Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at the agency at 11:00 AM today (18th) to discuss preparations for taking over the area west of the Jiangwan Town Railway. At the same time, the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will also have to be postponed.</p>
<h3>New Atmosphere After the Takeover</h3>
<p>▲ National Flags Flying to See the Light of Day Again ▲ Municipal Government Announcements to Settle Refugees The jurisdiction of the Fourth District Headquarters of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, south of Suzhou River, south of the railway, west of Zhejiang Road, and east of Guangzhao Road, as well as the territory of the First Branch and the Second Branch, has been taken over by our side after the withdrawal of the Japanese army. The city situation has gradually recovered. The details of various situations are recorded as follows ▲ Post Office Recovery The Zhabei District Post Office on Gonghe Road and the Postal Savings and Remittance Branch were reorganized by Director Zheng Yuanluan, leading the staff, the day before, and started working yesterday. It is temporarily stipulated that the office hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. There are a total of eight staff members and 24 mailmen. Ordinary letters, registered letters, and express letters in the received area are delivered as usual. However, ordinary letters have also been delivered to areas where the Japanese army has not yet withdrawn, while registered letters and express letters have been suspended to avoid errors. ▲ Household Registration Completed According to Wu Hefu, the director of the household registration section of the Public Security Bureau, there are about 20,000 households in the territory of the Fourth District Headquarters, about 5,000 in the territory of the Fourth District First Branch, and about 10,000 in the Second Branch, totaling more than 35,000 households.

The Zhabei Engineering Management Office of the Public Works Bureau went to sort out everything yesterday by the acting director, Zhou Zanbang, accompanied by three technicians and four foremen. ▲ Public Utilities Jiang Songxiao, the director of the street lamp management office of the Public Utilities Bureau, led workers and managers to sort out the street lamps since the day before and immediately sent workers to the received area to repair the street lamps. Because the damage to the street lamps was easy to repair, as of yesterday, more than 600 street lamps had been completely restored. The advertising management office on Zhongxing Road decided to temporarily move to No. 56 Minli Road to continue working as usual. The vehicle management office on Minli Road sent technician An Huan yesterday to sort out everything and is scheduled to start working today.

The ship donation office on Guangfu Road sent staff to sort it out yesterday and is scheduled to recover at the same time as the taxation office. ▲ Residents Move Back The shops, restaurants, vegetable restaurants, and snack shops in the received area of Zhabei have sorted out their windows and are preparing to resume business. Residents moved back from the concession to carry luggage and equipment in an endless stream, and the Hengfeng Bridge was overcrowded. Although the shops have not resumed business, they all hung the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth. The Shanghai North Office of the Public Security Bureau has sent double or four posts to each main road, and all road posts have been completely restored. The police brigade patrols the received area, and the security is very strict. ▲ Municipal Government Announcement Yesterday morning, Mayor Wu Tiecheng posted an announcement to reassure the people, saying, "For the sake of announcement, since the January 28 Incident, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Zhenru and other places have successively become war zones. The people have suffered the pain of exile, and their huts have suffered the disaster of artillery fire. Nine out of ten houses are empty, and the essence is exhausted. Flesh and blood are scattered, and livelihoods are collapsing. This mayor has witnessed this with heartache and is extremely sad and angry. Now that the ceasefire agreement has been concluded, the Japanese army is withdrawing one after another, and the order is becoming more and more stable. The districts that were complete in the past will naturally restore their prosperity. In addition to immediately restoring the guard and properly planning for post-disaster relief, this announcement is combined with the announcement of the migration of the people. Those who come to return to their old homes, serve your fields, sweep away the atmosphere, and restore our old view, without any hesitation. You will see the prosperity of the restoration. This mayor has great expectations. This announcement, May 16, 21st year of the Republic of China, Mayor Wu Tiecheng.</p>

As for the Japanese barracks in that area, they also began to be demolished yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Save-the-Post Movement</h3>
<p>▲ Representatives visited Chen Mingshu but still no resolution. ▲ Expedite the implementation of the Postal Base Consolidation Plan. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and postal workers' unions from all over the country have proposed a Postal Base Consolidation Plan and submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for adoption and implementation. However, after repeated submissions, the Ministry has not yet issued a definitive response to the plan proposed by the unions. Yesterday, the union sent representatives to visit Minister Chen Mingshu to present everything, but to no avail. The emotions of all postal workers in the union are becoming increasingly agitated. In recent days, postal workers' unions from all over the country have been continuously inquiring about the progress, and expressing that the plan is the only good strategy to save the post office and that, no matter what, they must insist on urging the authorities to realize it in order to seek the permanent consolidation of the postal base. The following is a record of the urgent telegram from the National Postal Workers' Union to the Ministry of Communications: Urgent, Respectfully addressed to the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing. Ever since the recovery of postal rights, the post office has been deteriorating day by day, with chaotic systems, the establishment of redundant agencies, and the misappropriation of postal funds, shaking the foundation of the post office. Looking back at the situation under Sir Kunde's management, one cannot help but feel heartbroken. Our association has long been determined to address the difficulties of the post office and to rectify and maintain it. The Postal Base Consolidation Plan jointly proposed by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and postal workers' unions from all over the country this time is a concrete rescue plan for the post office, obtained through years of research and verification. The Ministry of Communications should take charge of the consolidation of the post office and should have already made grand plans in its secret deliberations.

Vice Minister Guo replied that he had long intended to withdraw from everything after the signing of the Shanghai Armistice Agreement, and that he was even less willing to serve as Foreign Minister again with his disgraced body. The reporter then asked whether the order to go to the United Kingdom as an envoy had arrived in Shanghai and whether he had decided on whether or not to go. Guo replied that after the Executive Yuan decided to appoint him as the envoy to the United Kingdom, the British envoy Lampson had informed him that the British government had telegraphed its consent. However, he still intended to go to Nanjing to discuss this matter with President Wang, so it was not yet time to talk about whether or not to go.</p>

<p>British people to Japanese Ambassador</p>
<h3>Raising Objections to War</h3>
<p>▲Radical elements stormed the embassy and demanded to see Ambassador Matsudaira</p>
<p>▲ May Day demonstration in front of the embassy. The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reported that on the afternoon of the 9th, five representatives of the National Unemployed Workers' Movement of Great Britain, and one woman, broke into the Japanese Embassy in London. They forcefully demanded to meet Ambassador Matsudaira on the upper floor of the diplomats' residence and handed over a letter of protest against the war. At that time, Ambassador Matsudaira was working in his office. Upon hearing that the crowd was forcing their way in, he was afraid to leave his room for lunch. The situation was resolved only after police officers dispersed the crowd. It is noted that police officers entering the embassy is unprecedented. A special dispatch from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun in London stated that on the 9th, a crowd rushed into the Japanese Embassy, forcefully demanding to meet Ambassador Matsudaira and submitting a letter of protest regarding the Far East issue. Embassy personnel, upon hearing the news, sent police to suppress the crowd, who reluctantly left. Earlier, on May 1st, Labor Day, a large crowd had gathered and demonstrated in front of the Japanese Embassy, and it was fortunately resolved by police dispersal. Later, someone tried to ascertain the whereabouts of Ambassador Matsudaira. Matsudaira had returned to London from Geneva to attend the British royal banquets on the 11th and 12th. Upon hearing that Matsudaira had returned, they took this action. A Japanese Diet慰問團 Delegation Observes</p>
<h3>Dangerous Future of the Puppet State</h3>
<p>▲ Manchus worry about becoming a continuation of Korea</p>
<p>▲ Also fear falling into Zhang Xueliang's hands again. The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reported that the Diet member 慰問團慰問團 (comfort group), consisting of eighteen members including Tatsujiro Uchino, which had been sent to comfort the Kwantung Army and residents in Manchuria, returned home on the Nagasaki Maru on the 13th. According to Lieutenant General Uchino's inspection results, he made the following statement: Since the establishment of the new state of Manchuria, the Manchus have harbored concerns about the new state and its relationship with Japan, believing that Japan will eventually annex Manchuria like Korea, and the natives will be expelled by the Japanese. Even among the senior officials of the new state, there are concerns that after a future Japanese-American war, Manchuria will fall into the hands of Zhang Xueliang again. Therefore, they hold pessimistic views on various reforms. However, the Puyi, Zheng Xiaoxu, and Xi Qia faction are concerned about their own survival and pay close attention to future trends. As for Shanghai, it is currently difficult to expect Sino-Japanese amity. Although the entire army has been withdrawn and replaced by increased marine corps, it is still doubtful whether Sino-Japanese relations can avoid unfortunate incidents in the future.</p>
<h3>Inspection Report of Shanhaiguan</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese troops repeatedly spy on Jioumenkou and Shimenzhai</p>
<p>▲ The puppet Fengshan Railway is completely owned by the Japanese. This reporter met with local authorities in Shanhaiguan in the evening, who claimed that the Japanese military's request to suppress the activities of the Volunteer Army is not only aimed at Shanhaiguan, but also seeks to seize Jioumenkou and Shimenzhai. Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, previously sent someone to Shanhaiguan, repeatedly demanding that Brigade Commander He allow Japan to send 国境監視警察 (border surveillance police) to be stationed in Jioumenkou and Shimenzhai. He did not agree to this. Even when the Japanese army pursued the Volunteer Army, they were not allowed to cross the border of Suizhong County. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, Japanese troops suddenly arrived at Lijia Fort, which is under the jurisdiction of Linyu County and is located in Hebei Province. The Japanese army has clearly invaded eastward. On the morning of the 11th, more than 400 Japanese soldiers went to Mayingzi to be stationed. According to reports from local refugees, the Japanese army fired live ammunition for about twenty minutes when they arrived in the village. From Shanhaiguan to Jinzhou, a large Japanese detachment is stationed in Suizhong. In recent days, many have been dispatched to Qiansuo and Qianwei. Because Jioumenkou is the throat of Yuguan, and if this place is lost, Yuguan will be shaken, our side has now dispatched troops to guard it. Japanese soldiers in Shanhaiguan have been conducting exercises in the South China Barracks for days. Fearing accidents, many residents near South China have moved into the city. Also, at 4 PM on the 10th, more than 80 puppet police officers, led by Captain Kinukawa Hitoshi (Korean) and Squad Leader Guan Zongxian (Chinese), conducted drills outside the southeast corner of the city wall and fired live pistols. The residents were panicked. Because the police had previously declared that they were protecting the road, but their actions had gone too far, Brigade Commander He has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese garrison commander, Matsushita Shigetoshi. In response to the Japanese army, fearing that it would use the pretext of various dangers to overseas Chinese, we have organized a special police force to be responsible for the Nan Guan area. In the future, the station will also be managed by this police force. The Ninth Brigade is responsible for the security of the city. The special police serve as a buffer between the Chinese and Japanese troops. It is verified that the police were all selected from Linyu County. There is a post every two to three hundred steps. The captain is concurrently the Public Security Bureau Chief, Chen Baoshen.</p>
<p>This reporter then returned to the station to investigate the organization of the puppet Fengshan Railway. The General Bureau of the railway is located at the Liaoning Main Station. Shanhaiguan has a Chief of General Section in charge of traffic matters. There are two daily trains from Shanhaiguan in the morning and evening. One goes to Jinzhou, and one goes directly to Shenyang. There is a train commander (Japanese) on the train. All passengers must be inspected at the major stations of Suizhong, Jinzhou, and Goubangzi. Japanese inspectors grope young women's breasts and lower parts, while Japanese soldiers laugh beside them. The impolite behavior is hateful. The puppet Fengshan Railway trains are those seized from the Beining Railway. The locomotives and passenger cars have been changed to Fengshan symbols. The passenger cars are green. The station masters at each station are Japanese, and the deputy station masters are Chinese. The Japanese station masters are stern and harsh to their subordinates. If they are slightly displeased, they will punch and kick them. A certain Zhang, the deputy station master of Dagushan, released the westbound train two or three minutes early on the 8th of this month. The Japanese station master slapped him hard and ordered him to run on the platform for an hour. Zhang resigned in debt, but was arrested and imprisoned by the Japanese army. All railway telegrams and telephones are controlled by the Japanese station masters, and Chinese station masters are not allowed to interfere. Station accounting has been completely changed to Japanese characters. Of the puppet Fengshan Railway branch lines, only the Yingkou branch line and the Jinchao branch line can operate. The rest have not yet been restored. As for the puppet Fengshan Railway's consignment of passengers' luggage, in addition to collecting freight per piece, the Japanese station master must also pay an additional two jiao (small coins) per piece of luggage. This money goes into the Japanese station master's private pocket. A small number of the puppet Fengshan Railway police are former police from the Beining Railway, and the majority were recruited in Shenyang. The puppet Fengshan Railway porters have also changed into new-style vests, with a red circle of cloth embedded in the middle, inscribed with the English initials of Fengshan and numbers. At 8:40 PM, the puppet Fengshan train arrived from Shenyang to Shanhaiguan. Most of the passengers are working-class people. Only one first and second class passenger car is attached, and no one cares. The passenger cars are plastered with Honjo Shigeru's proclamations and proclamations from the puppet railway bureau. Honjo's proclamation advises farmers not to join the Volunteer Army, and the language is extremely comical. When the passenger car arrives at Shanhaiguan Station, the puppet police board the train to inspect it. Before the various trains of the Beining Railway depart, the puppet police also patrol with guns, paying close attention to the passengers. After the reporter completed his inspection, he took the Beining train back to Beiping that evening. However, a police officer followed him. In the first-class compartment, the Japanese army openly opened the door to inspect. The Shanhaiguan station of the Beining Railway is managed by a foreign employee, Corbin. Due to the Japanese military's disturbances, Corbin moved his office to a small foreign building next to the station to avoid their arrogance. In summary, the situation in Shanhaiguan is already extremely tense. (12th) Central Aircraft</p>
<h3>Reconnaissance and Bombing of Red Bandits in Zhengyang</h3>
<p>▲ Bandits in Lu'an moving towards Zhengyang</p>
<p>▲ Fu and Huo counties are stepping up their defenses. According to communications from Bengbu, Zhengyang in northern Anhui has fallen. Bandits from Lu'an have been increasing towards Zhengyang for days. According to the Changhuai Water Police Bureau's Anbing warship's investigation in Fengtai, when Zhengyang was first occupied by the bandits, they still allowed people to enter and exit. There are about a thousand bandits, who have looted several hundred strong men and women, and dozens of ships of property, all transported to the Lu'an area. On the 13th, the bandits pressed on to Thirty Li Fort, and Shouxian was in a tight situation, with telephone lines cut. Cheng Ying, of Ni Rongxian's团团, and the county police are responsible for defending the city and are on high alert. That night, Ni arrived in Fengtai by car, and his two battalions were scheduled to arrive in the county seat on the 14th. Ni held a defense meeting at the county government with Wang, the director of the Water Police Bureau. The defense is temporarily guarded by the water police and local regiment police. The forces are weak, so there is a great need for reinforcements. Approximately one hundred refugee boats from the Zhengyang and Shouzheng areas are coming to Bengbu one after another. The Chang'an ship arrived in Bengbu from Fengtai at 11 AM on the 14th, reporting the truth. The ship is scheduled to continue upstream on the Huai River tonight (15th) or tomorrow morning to continue to explore the upstream situation and maintain the waterway to ensure unimpeded traffic. The 7th Aviation Squadron stationed in Bengbu dispatched seven aircraft driven by pilots at 11 AM on the 14th to Zhengyang for reconnaissance. They saw a team of Red bandits carrying red flags entering the south gate and dropped multiple bombs to bomb the bandits. Until the afternoon, the seven aircraft returned to Bengbu. On the 15th, two more aircraft were dispatched and flew to Zhengyang to conduct reconnaissance and bombing of the bandits. According to refugees from Zhengyang, Song Shikebu, west and south of Zhengyang, is engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits, and the people's militia have also risen up to support them. The Hidden Treasure Collection and Matou Collection have been recaptured by the people's militia. Battles have also occurred near Thirty Li Fort between Zheng and Shou, probably between the团警团警 and the bandits. Fuyang, Yingshang, Huoqiu, Shouxian, Fengtai, and other counties have all stepped up their defenses. Lu'an is also defending. On the morning of the 15th, Xu Tingyao's unit of the 4th Division arrived with a brigade and stopped in Bengbu for a short rest before heading to the upper reaches of the Changhuai to suppress the bandits in Zhengyang. (15th) Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Border</p>
<h3>Establishment of a General Headquarters for Suppressing Communists</h3>
<p>▲ Zhu Peide appointed commander, headquarters established in Hankou</p>
<p>▲ Troops stationed in the border areas of the three provinces are under his command. According to communications from Hankou, the 伪第四军 puppet Fourth Army led by Kuang Jixun in the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui border areas is the most valiant. In recent years, the counties of Guangshan, Luoshan, Huangchuan, Shangcheng, and Gushi in Henan Province, Huangpi, Huang'an, Macheng, and Huangmei in Hubei Province, and Huoqiu, Yingshan, Huoshan, and Taihu in Anhui Province have all been ravaged. Government troops have also repeatedly suffered defeats in suppression campaigns, such as the capture of Yue Weijun and the death in battle of Zhao Guanying. The arrogance of the bandits is self-evident. After the fall of Huang'an, the bandit's new base was successfully established again. Thus, it can spy on Xinyang to the north, damage the Pinghan Railway, and take Wuhan to the south, intending to occupy the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The situation is serious, almost more so than in the past. Initially, the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Border Pacification Commissioner's Office was established, with Li Mingzhong as the commissioner. The troops under his jurisdiction included the four divisions of Ji Ren, Yu Xiang, Ge Yunlong, and Xia Douyin. Ji Ren pursued, and Yu intercepted. After years of bloody battles, the bandit's momentum was slightly curbed, but it was impossible to thoroughly eliminate them due to the deep mountains and dense forests. Later, Ji Hongchang left his post, and Li also had internal problems. In January of this year, Li resigned, and the Pacification Commissioner's Office was abolished at the same time. The suppression of bandits in the border area was without a dedicated official responsible. In April, the Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office sent representatives to Beijing to visit the Military Affairs Committee, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to report on the military affairs of bandit suppression in Hubei Province and suggested that a senior official be appointed in the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui border areas to be responsible for overall supervision and suppression. After considering for a long time, Chiang believed it was necessary, so he decided to appoint Zhu Peide as the General Commander for Communist Suppression in the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Border Areas. The headquarters will be established in Hankou, and all troops stationed in the border areas of the three provinces will be under his command. The 88th Division of Yu Jishi, which previously resisted Japan in Shanghai, has also been dispatched to assist. Zhu is currently the Director of the Office of the Military Affairs Committee and Director of the Third Department, and he will not be replaced. Once he finds someone to act on his behalf, he will come to Hankou to invite the military authorities of the three provinces to hold a military conference to decide on a concrete plan for bandit suppression, and then issue a mobilization order. It is expected that the bandit suppression will become more active in the future.</p>
<h3>Hubei Province Actively Clearing the Countryside</h3>
<p>▲ The Countryside Clearing Promotion Association holds a membership meeting</p>
<p>▲ Requesting military and political organs to recover the fees apportioned to the gentry and wealthy. According to communications from Hankou, the Hubei Countryside Clearing Promotion Association has been established for quite some time and bears the greatest responsibility for raising funds. At the beginning of the association's establishment, it stipulated that the post-bandit suppression expenses would be 10 million yuan, with five methods of raising funds: (1) collecting salt surcharges, (2) increasing land taxes, (3) collecting business protection donations, (4) issuing post-disaster public bonds, and (5) fines from banning opium in various counties. The fifth item is negligible. Items two and three are also difficult to implement. Only items one and four are sufficient to supplement. However, the collection of salt surcharges has not yet been approved by the central government. Recently, after negotiations between the Pacification Office and the Hubei Coast Salt Affairs Audit Office, they have agreed to allocate 150,000 yuan per month. The item of bandit suppression public bonds totals 3 million yuan, which is to be apportioned among the gentry and wealthy in the province with property above 20,000 yuan according to their grades. However, after the floods and bandit disasters in Hubei Province, the poor have long been buried in ditches, and many of the wealthy have scattered in all directions. It is uncertain whether such a huge amount of money can be raised as scheduled. In order to facilitate bandit suppression, the association convened the second membership meeting on the 14th to discuss this matter. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Those gentry and wealthy who are apportioned public bonds and fail to pay within the deadline or refuse to accept letters of recommendation for public bonds shall be submitted to military and political organs for assistance in recovery. (2) If the gentry and wealthy believe that the amount of the purchase is inconsistent with their property, after verification, they shall be recommended for subscription according to their actual property. (3) The salt tax surcharge will continue to be strongly advocated to the central government, and 200,000 yuan per month will be allocated from the salt tax items for bandit suppression expenses until the day the bandits are cleared. Many people attended the meeting that day. He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, Kong Geng, Li Shucheng, Ye Peng, and others participated. Xia and He both gave speeches. Xia said that bandit suppression has made progress recently, but no one has handled the aftermath of each recaptured place. He hopes that the gentry and elders living in Wuhan will return to their hometowns, lead the people, and jointly seek to recuperate. He said that the bandit suppression in Hubei Province has been approved by the central government, and two more divisions have been transferred to assist, which can be deployed soon, and the strength can be said to be substantial. He hopes that public bonds will be raised as soon as possible so that it can progress smoothly. As for the discipline of the troops, it must be rectified, and it must be strictly corrected by orders. In addition, regarding the matter of borrowing one million yuan from the banking community with municipal public bonds as collateral, it was previously agreed that He Baohua, the representative of the Pacification Office, Shen Zhaonian, the representative of the Provincial Government, and Zhou Xingtang, the representative of the Association, would be responsible for the negotiations. However, the conditions of the banking community were very harsh: (1) The amount of the loan was reduced to 400,000 yuan. (2) The 150,000 yuan per month promised by the Salt Affairs Office was designated as collateral. (3) The Clearing Association apportioned 720,000 yuan in public bonds to the banking community, canceling the original agreement, resulting in no results. Therefore, He and others also presented reports at the general assembly meeting, and all agreed that they could not accept it, so it was agreed to hold another meeting that night to discuss it in detail. It is heard that it will be decided to abandon this loan and borrow from Jin City, Nonggong, and Provincial Banks. It is expected that it can be established after further negotiations. (May 14th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Rectifies Land Tax</h3>
<p>The Regulations for the Organization of the Land Tax Rectification Committee of Jiangsu Province have been passed by the Provincial Committee Meeting. They are now recorded as follows: (Article 1) The purpose of these measures is to rectify land tax and eliminate accumulated malpractices. (Article 2) The Land Tax Rectification Committee shall be jointly organized by one or two capable personnel from each office and department under the Provincial Government who are familiar with the land tax situation. (Article 3) The Committee shall rectify land tax in each county, starting with the county with the most serious accumulated malpractices, and the county shall be designated on a temporary basis. (Article 4) When the Committee arrives in a county, it shall first check the grain depot’s register of grain quotas, the household registers, and the tax collection registers to ascertain the exact amount of old arrears over the years, as well as the amount of grain depot collusion, both paid and unpaid, as a basis for investigation. (Article 5) In the case of old arrears, if it is found that the head of the grain depot and the tax collection officials have engaged in malfeasance, secretly collected taxes without remitting them, and the actual arrears are on the books of the clerks, the clerks should be immediately detained and ordered to make restitution within a deadline. If they resist detention and refuse to pay, their property should be seized and they should be severely punished according to the law. (Article 6) In the case of old arrears, if it is found that local bullies and gentry have resisted payment, and the actual arrears are owed by large households, the clerks should be instructed to truthfully provide a list of the names and addresses of the large households to the county, and military police should be dispatched, along with tax collection officials, to collect taxes from each household. If they still resist payment, they should be summoned to court for detention and pursuit, or their property should be seized for compensation. (Article 7) In the case of old arrears, in addition to the depot clerks and large households, there are also scattered small households with actual arrears owed by the people. The tax collection officials of each village should be instructed to summon the village heads to the bureau to report the true names and addresses of each taxpayer, and pursue payment from each household. If they intentionally conceal information and refuse to truthfully report, the village tax collection officials and village heads should be immediately dismissed and sent to the county for strict punishment. (Article 8) If the head of the grain depot in each county is found to have engaged in malfeasance and embezzled a large amount of national tax revenue, and the circumstances are serious, the Committee should submit a special report to the Provincial Government and dispatch police to escort him to the province for strict punishment according to the law. (Article 9) When the Committee members go to the counties to serve, they shall be paid travel expenses according to regulations. (Article 10) The expenses for rectifying land tax shall be paid from the item of overdue fines. (Article 11) These measures shall be promulgated and implemented after being decided by the Provincial Government Committee.</p>
<h3>The Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Gradually Becomes Active</h3>
<p>In recent months, due to the sluggishness of the world economy, silk prices have plummeted, and finance has stagnated. The silk inventory in Shanghai has reached more than 20,000 bales, and the silkworm cocoon inventory has reached more than 100,000 piculs. Silk and cocoon operators have suspended operations due to capital losses, and silver firms have stopped lending due to the falling value of collateral. A few days ago, the Ministry of Industry and the competent authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces convened various related industries in Shanghai to hold a silk and cocoon relief conference, and resolved to exempt raw silk exports from taxes and subsidize each picul by one hundred taels. The Shanghai silver firms also believe that silk sales are of great importance to finance, and have continued to provide loans as much as possible. In the future, cocoon market activities and the resumption of work in silk factories are expected. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry believes that the province's silkworm industry is prevalent in the south of the Yangtze River, and it is difficult to achieve universal loan issuance in Shanghai. It specifically instructed the county governments and chambers of commerce of Kunshan, Wuxian, Wujiang, Jintan, Danyang, Wujin, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Changshu, Yizheng, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Jurong, Huaiyin, Lianshui, Yixing, Liyang, Jingjiang, Songjiang, Nantong, and Haimen to instruct the silver and money industries to cooperate with silk and cocoon merchants and help each other when spring cocoons are on the market in order to maintain the silkworm industry. According to a Hangzhou dispatch, the silk and cocoon industries in Zhejiang Province have also become pessimistic since being affected by the Shanghai war. In order to relieve the silk and cocoon industry, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has formulated five measures and submitted them to the Political Committee for deliberation and implementation. Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Department of Construction, went to Shanghai a few days ago to attend the joint meeting of the authorities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and achieved satisfactory results in relieving the silk and cocoons of various provinces. The Hangzhou silver and money industry has organized a loan committee on the second floor of the Bank of China. Cocoon merchants in various counties and silkworm farmers in rural areas can directly borrow money. The provincial government also proposed resolutions on the 483rd committee meeting of the Finance and Construction Departments, resolving to set the maximum and minimum cocoon prices from 15 yuan to 30 yuan, and the cocoon drying fee shall not exceed three yuan. The municipal and county governments have been ordered to announce this to the public. The Hangzhou Municipal Government has also persuaded the cocoon merchants in Hangzhou to collect new posts from the Department of Finance and set up cocoon collection agencies. The cocoon agencies in Linping, Pingyao, Jianqiao, and Tangqi and other towns have all started weighing cocoons on the 16th. Yesterday, farmers who picked cocoons for sale were already on their way. This year, all cocoon agencies are using new weights. The purchase price of 100 catties of fresh cocoons is about 30 yuan. However, only Qingcheng is a silk weaving factory in the urban area that collects cocoons. (May 15)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express News</h3>
<p>▲Wuhu County was recently ordered to build the Wuhu-Xuancheng-Guangde Highway within a limited time. County Magistrate Wu is actively preparing with the Director of the Construction Bureau, has established an office, raised enough labor, and is scheduled to start construction on the 18th and complete it within ten days. ▲Luo Liangjian, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of the Anhui Provincial Government, accompanied by Zhang Yawei of the Provincial Committee, went to Hefei from Wuhu to discuss Anhui politics with Chen Diaoyuan, and went to Chaoxian County to investigate the incident in which County Magistrate Qi Wenqu shot and killed several people while registering tobacco seedlings. He returned to the province via Wuhu yesterday. ▲In Anhui Province, in addition to the 27 offices set up by the Special Business Tax Bureau, local branches are also scattered, which is more harmful than the previous Likin checkpoints. Chambers of Commerce in various counties have requested their cancellation, but have not yet been approved. Now, the Provincial Federation of Commerce has expressed that the new provincial government still has no intention to abolish the tax. Today, it sent another telegram to fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai and chambers of commerce in various counties, requesting a concerted effort to save the people of Anhui. ▲The Wuhu Infant Care Center once planned to sell 40 acres of land along the Xijiang River, where it operates, due to insufficient funding. However, it was recently discovered that although the land was nominally sold to Zheng Yuebo, the manager of the Chinese and He Fu Kerosene Company, it was actually resold to the American Texaco Oil Company to build oil tanks. Although the price was 41,000 yuan, the Infant Care Center actually received less than 15,000 yuan. Therefore, Anhui natives in Beijing and people from all walks of life opposed it as selling national land and losing sovereignty. People from all walks of life held another meeting at the Infant Care Center today, unanimously advocating to suspend the sale. (14th) Local Communication</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲Re-requesting Exemption from Rent The Jiangsu Provincial Government collected two months' rent this time. Because this county is adjacent to the war zone, and affected by the war, the social economy is in panic. After making great efforts to raise money, one month's collection has been handed over to the province. Now the official authorities want to collect the second month's rent. Merchants and people, unable to bear the burden, have repeatedly requested the Chamber of Commerce to send a telegram to the provincial government on a cold day, appealing for exemption. Now Wu Baocheng and others have sent another telegram to the provincial government and the departments of finance and civil affairs. The text reads: Gu Junjian, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, I humbly report that since the Shanghai War occurred, Songjiang County is adjacent to the war zone. Affected by the war, all industries have been suspended. The losses suffered are extremely high, and the people's strength is depleted to the extreme. The local people have struggled to pay one month of this rent collection, which is already difficult. It is also heard that Shanghai and neighboring counties have been granted exemptions. Therefore, I especially appeal to your Excellency to consider the difficulties of the people and approve the exemption of the second month's rent collection, so as to leave a little vitality to the local area. We are deeply grateful. In addition to submitting to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance, we hereby submit this telegram, Wu Baocheng, Du Lin, Mei Huang, Wu Zhengfu, Tang Mujiu, Wang Yufang, etc. kowtow.</p>

<p>▲Smuggling Cattle to Aid the Enemy Cao Yunlong, captain of the first squad of the sixth team of the second district of the Water Police, seized three boats smuggling cattle at Gaoqiaokou yesterday, carrying a total of 61 cattle, along with cattle traffickers Zhu, boatmen Shen Fusheng Yao Chaoyun, etc., and sent them to the team headquarters. According to them, the cattle were goods from Zhu Yongtai's cattle business in Danyang, and were intended to be shipped to Shanghai to be resold to Japanese merchants. Captain Cao Yunlong immediately solved the problem of smuggling cattle to aid the enemy, since the smuggling of cattle has long been strictly prohibited by provincial order, and the cattle that aid the enemy are even more important.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>▲Two Navigational Vessels Robbed The navigational vessel from Wu County to Yixing Heqiao, which departed from Changzhou City at Zhang Evening, encountered a pirate ship early in the morning of the 15th, near the Wudong Bridge in Yixing County. More than a dozen bandits fired shots to intimidate the vessel, and then jumped onto the navigational vessel to search and plunder. The loss was about a thousand yuan in total, but no one was injured. The day before, a navigational vessel from Zhaibqiao, while passing through the Shiwudong Bridge, was also robbed. The cargo on board was all moved to the pirate ship before it sailed away, resulting in a huge loss. Afterwards, both vessels reported the case to the county government and requested the arrest of the bandits. ▲Two Kidnappers Apprehended Zhang Yinsheng, the head of the Jinniu Township in the fourth district of Wu County, was previously kidnapped by bandits and then redeemed with money. Yesterday, the 14th, Fu Zhonghe, the captain of the police squad stationed in Panxu Town, received a report that the kidnappers in the case were Zhang Rongzhao and Zhang Heshang, who had previously surrendered themselves. He immediately sent a team to the Wang Hongquan teahouse in Baizhang Town and apprehended the two criminals, Zhang and others. After interrogation, they confessed to acting as intermediaries for a ransom of 800 yuan and receiving rewards. Captain Chuan immediately sent the two criminals to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>▲County Magistrate Escorted to Province Hua Zhen, the county magistrate of Xinghua County, had been in office for nine months of ten years. Recently, he was impeached and dismissed by the provincial government meeting at the suggestion of Zhao, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. Before this, on the morning of the 12th, he secretly ordered the new County Magistrate Chen Yuyan to lead the first company of the special service battalion of the Security Department, led by Hui Shaoxing, and a squad of soldiers, to quietly go to the Xinghua County Government to show the order. Hua immediately handed over the seal. After Chen took over the matter, Hua was placed under the supervision of Hui, and the four department heads, Cai Zhaoyuan, Huang Huang, He Jiazhen, and Hu Tingliang, were placed under the supervision of Shi Decheng, the captain of the county police brigade, pending review and handling by the provincial order. Yesterday afternoon, County Magistrate Hua and Commander Hui arrived in the province under escort and were temporarily detained at the first company headquarters of the Provincial Government, pending instructions from Director Zhao. ▲Kidnapping Case in Yizheng Cracked The kidnapping case that occurred on the night of the 13th of this month at the Shifang Silkworm Seed Farm in the Xinximen of this city was learned by Shao, the captain of the Provincial Capital Investigation Team, who immediately led a team to pursue the kidnappers in different directions. On the way, he learned from Li Xingwu that there were bandit boats hiding in the Sanyi River, and the case was probably committed by the bandits. After receiving the report, Captain Shao immediately ordered Zhang Jichuan, the investigator, Li Yuwu, the investigator, and several others to go to the river to arrest the bandits. Two bandit boats from the Sanyi River were found, and several male and female kidnappers, including Liu Buxiang and Li Wangshi, were arrested. Two kidnapped children from Yizheng, Yang Songling (13 years old) and Bian Xiuzi (11 years old), were rescued and taken with the team for interrogation. As for the kidnapping case at the Shifang Silkworm Seed Farm, a suspect was arrested a few days ago, but after interrogation yesterday, no clues were found. The farm has not yet received a ransom letter.</p>

<p>▲The Tragic Situation of Disaster Victims in Jiangdu County In the Touxinqiao Township of the third district of Jiangdu County, due to the floods last year, there was no autumn harvest. The cries of the hungry were everywhere. Later, the disaster relief association witnessed the tragic situation and allocated some wheat flour to the township to provide temporary relief to hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. Unexpectedly, the spring famine this year is even worse. The disaster victims are all digging reed roots and river grass to fill their hunger, and recently they have even reached the point of starvation. This tragic situation is truly unbearable to witness. Now, in the blink of an eye, it is time to plant autumn crops, but it is difficult to raise funds for labor and seeds. If no measures are taken to provide relief, then there will be no hope for the autumn harvest this year.</p>

<p>▲Shot and Killed the Victim After Extortion Attempt On the night of the 12th, at the home of Xu Fucheng, the elder brother of Xu, the deputy head of Zhangzhuang Township, Libao District of this county, several bandits holding box guns suddenly came to Xu's house and attempted to extort silver dollars. When the extortion attempt failed, Xu was shot and killed. Later, the security team rushed to pursue the bandits, but they had already fled far away.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>▲Banditry and Injury in the East Township The home of farmer Song Rubing in the second village of the East Township of this county was robbed by bandits the night before, and the victim was burned with fire. Yesterday, Song Rubing came to the city to file a report with the county government, requesting an examination of the injuries. At 3 p.m., Judge Zhang held a court hearing. According to Song Rubing's statement, at the time of the ninth watch, four bandits came, speaking with a local accent, and broke into the house. They burned the victim's parents and children, and then entered the room to search and rob, resulting in the loss of 50 silver dollars and clothing, etc. He requested an examination and handling of the case, etc. Later, Zhu Dezhang, the examiner, confirmed that Song Rubing, his father Song Yongfeng, and his mother Song Bian had indeed been burned. Judge Zhang ordered that personnel be dispatched to investigate the scene, ordered the team to strictly investigate, and return the case for handling according to the law. It is reported that Song Yongfeng, due to his age of over seventy years, suffered severe burns and may be in danger of death. Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Gao Keji</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor, I was astonished to read the news in your newspaper on May 14th, "A Tragedy Occurred in the Nanhui Election Committee." It has been found that Keji received a public letter from the Nanhui County Security Committee, ordering him to investigate the case of Chen Eyi and others, citizens of the sixth district, accusing Chen Xinyi, the head of the district, and Tang Yaoyu, the head of the jia, of illegally detaining, tying up, and injuring them. On the morning of May 10th, he took the first patrol boat of the police team sent by the county government with 12 policemen to Liuzhao Town. As soon as they arrived at the pier of the town's steamer, they saw Tang Yaoyu, Ji Qingren, Lu Da, Zhang Yongmei, Zhang Peilin and others leading many people with guns gathered on the shore. In an instant, they swarmed off the boat, forcibly twisted and dragged Keji ashore. Tang Yaoyu, Ji Qingren, Lu Da and others directed the rioters to open fire, beat Keji, and imprisoned him. The firearms carried by the accompanying policemen were also snatched away. The Zhuhai Security Team heard the alarm and came to rescue them, but their weapons were also confiscated, and three members of the team were captured. Fortunately, the county government continued to send a police team, a water patrol team, a guerrilla team, and policemen to rescue them in time. The above is Keji's situation of being beaten and imprisoned when he went to the sixth place to investigate the case that morning, which has nothing to do with the party headquarters election. The content of your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts. I am writing to request a correction in order to avoid confusing rumors. I sincerely hope so. Gao Keji, May 14th</p>

<h3>Account of the French Mail Ship Fire</h3>
<p>▲First-class Ship George Philippar</p>
<p>▲Machine Exploded, Ship-Wide Electrical Failure</p>
<p>▲Total Loss of Two Million Dollars</p>
<p>The newly built, most modern, first-class mail ship George Philippar of the French Mail Ship Company, after its completion, came to Shanghai for the first time. On April 23, it sailed back to its home country from this port. Unexpectedly, when it reached the Red Sea, near the port of Athens, the ship's hull suddenly exploded, and the entire ship caught fire. Many passengers were in distress, and even more sailors were killed. The ship was almost completely destroyed, with a loss of approximately $20 million. This is truly the greatest tragedy in the maritime world in recent times. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Elegant Ship Hull</p>
<p>The ship is the best and largest new mail ship of the French Mail Ship Company. The elegance of the passenger cabin layout, and the magnificence of the reception hall and dining room, are almost like a royal palace. According to the company's statement to reporters yesterday, the ship's large dining room is the first in Europe in terms of its magnificence and grandeur. The cost of the decoration at that time was 1 million francs, and the furnishings in the hall were mostly valuable antiques. The total cost of the ship, as confirmed yesterday, was 80 million francs, equivalent to 10 million taels of Shanghai silver.</p>
<p>▲Details of the Accident</p>
<p>Last year, the French Mail Ship Company built two new 24,000-ton, high-speed mail ships, using electric steam power, capable of traveling 19 nautical miles per hour. One was named Phil Croesus, and the other George Philippar, both assigned to the China-France line. The ship's maiden voyage to Shanghai coincided with the aftermath of the Great War in Shanghai. On April 23, it made its first trip from Shanghai to Marseille. Many passengers boarded the ship for Europe. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, the ship arrived in the Red Sea, near the port of Athens, off the coast of Soumailli. Suddenly, an explosion occurred in the engine room. Because it was powered by electricity, the fire quickly spread throughout the ship, and the situation was particularly fierce. Captain Vick urgently sent a wireless call for help, and at the same time released lifeboats to rescue passengers.</p>
<p>▲Passengers Rescued</p>
<p>This time, the ship was carrying a total of 950 passengers to France, of whom 135 disembarked from Shanghai, mostly Westerners, with only a few Chinese, such as Wang Jun and Mrs. Shen Wang. Westerners, such as Mr. Mazzalron, the manager of the French Tram Company in Shanghai, also took this ship back to their country. After the accident, two British ships and one Russian ship first sailed to rescue the passengers. It has been reported that about 600 people have been rescued by British and Russian merchant ships. It is still unclear whether the remaining 300 people were rescued by other ships or went missing, as there have been no further reports. Among the passengers on board this time, most of those who departed from Shanghai were French naval officers, and a team of French naval soldiers withdrawn from Shanghai also took this ship back to their country. This time, they all suffered the same fate.</p>
<p>▲Russian Ship Rescues</p>
<p>The National News Agency's Aden dispatch on the 17th stated that a wireless message was received today stating that a Soviet Russian ship carrying 420 passengers and crew members rescued from the George Philippar was sailing here. In addition, it has also been confirmed that among those who escaped danger, three have died and several have suffered severe burns. It is now feared that the total number of deaths and injuries, after combining reports from various sources, will far exceed this number.</p>
<p>▲Rescued Passengers</p>
<p>Reuters' Athens dispatch on the 17th stated that the Kandelaker carried over 128 rescued people, including 66 passengers, 15 soldiers, 22 sailors, and 25 seamen. It will arrive here at 3:00 p.m. today. The Masut carried 125 rescued people, including 39 French passengers, 16 children, 5 natives, 11 naval soldiers, 3 crew members, and 51 Chinese seamen. It will arrive here at 5:00 p.m. The French ship Antrepont set sail at midnight yesterday to pick up the 420 people rescued by the other ship, and then transport them here, or send them to Jibouti.</p>
<p>▲Difficult Navigation in the Red Sea</p>
<p>The Red Sea is a very hot place, and navigation is very difficult. Five years ago, the company's mail ship Vindinapora also had an accident there. This time, when the George Philippar traveled to that place, the French Navy ship in this port received a wireless report stating that the cause of the accident was that the Red Sea was too hot, which caused an electrical explosion that spread throughout the ship. Therefore, although there were fire-fighting equipment on board, it was impossible to extinguish the fire.</p>
<p>▲Sharks Eat People</p>
<p>There are many sharks in the Red Sea, and they are all huge. Sailors warn each other against working when ships pass through, because if they fall into the sea, they will definitely be eaten by the sharks, and there is no hope of survival. This time, when the ship had an accident, many of the people on board who did not have time to get into the lifeboats and fell into the sea could not be rescued and were eaten by sharks.</p>
<p>▲Sailors Killed</p>
<p>Most of the firemen in the ship's stokehold were Chinese, totaling 19. At the time of the electrical explosion, these 19 firemen were unable to escape and were all killed by the explosion. It is said that none survived. A considerable number of sailors also failed to escape and were buried in the fire. The investigation is still ongoing.</p>
<p>▲Goods Completely Lost</p>
<p>The goods transported to Marseille and Paris from Shanghai on this ship included 214 pieces of Huzhou silk and silk waste, 210 boxes of tea, 59 pieces of valuable luggage, yarn waste, pig intestines, and dozens of pieces of groceries. A large amount of goods shipped from Japan, Hong Kong, and other ports to France was also on board. This time, the cargo hold was completely burned down.</p>
<p>▲Ship Hull Destroyed</p>
<p>The ship is still burning near Athens. Captain Vick has been rescued by a Russian ship. It is found that the captain was originally the captain of the Bourges ship. Last year, the Bourges ship caught fire and burned down in France, so he was reassigned as the captain of the new ship. Unexpectedly, he encountered a disaster on his first voyage. Now, the Shanghai office has received a telegram from the Athens branch, but the cause of the accident has not been reported in detail. However, it can be confirmed that the ship is completely destroyed. The total loss is estimated to be 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>▲Startling Questions</p>
<p>The National News Agency's Paris dispatch on the 17th stated that although there are many conflicting reports about the passengers on the French mail ship George Philippar, there is now good reason to believe that all of them are out of danger. As for the cause of the fire, it is still a mystery, and speculation has begun. It is still remembered that the ship was almost destroyed by fire not long after it was launched. Therefore, some people speculate that there are still weaknesses in its internal structure, which led to this major disaster. However, some also speculate that the negligence was due to someone else's conspiracy. It is said that before the ship set sail for its maiden voyage from Saigong, detectives boarded the ship for a thorough search. At that time, the authorities discovered a conspiracy, because the ship was transporting military supplies to Japan, and some people attempted to blow it up. Although the shipping company denied it at the time, and the detectives did not find any suspicious objects, it is speculated that there may have been an automatic explosive device hidden in the ship, which the detectives did not detect. However, because its timing mechanism was incomplete, it did not explode until the return voyage. Starting today</p>
<h3>Suspension of Silk Export Tax</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reports that, due to the recent decline in the silk industry, the government has established relief measures. According to reliable information, the export tax on white silk, gray silk, yellow silk, dougong silk, and waste silk listed in Nos. 180 to 184 of all export tariffs, as well as the special donation originally levied (i.e., the silk industry public debt fund collected by the Jianghai Customs), has been decided by the Ministry of Finance to be suspended from the 18th of this month, and all customs nationwide have been ordered to implement it uniformly.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Epidemic Prevention Efforts</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, the authorities of the Chinese and foreign concessions held a meeting regarding the current outbreak of cholera in the city. The outbreak was discovered earlier this year than last. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health of the Ministry of Interior, along with specialists Jin Baoshan and Yan Zhizhong, have already arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, at 3:00 PM, they convened a formal epidemic prevention meeting at the Shanghai Port Quarantine Administration. All agenda items were fully discussed and have been submitted to the relevant agencies for prompt and effective implementation to benefit public health. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Details: Attendees included Hu Hongji, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, and Division Chief Wu Liguo; Jordan, Director of the Public Concession Health Department; Dr. Labo, representing the French Concession Municipal Council's Supervisor Fotianya; Wang Peiyuan, Chairman of the Chinese Red Cross; Yan Xiqing, President of the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital; Chen Yonghan, representing Zong Liande, Director of the National Port Quarantine Administration; Cheng Zhaiyi, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory; and Liu Ruiheng, Jin Baoshan, and Yan Zhizhong from the Department of Health, among others. Director Liu served as chairman. After the meeting commenced, the chairman gave a speech, stating briefly that the joint epidemic prevention work of the Chinese and foreign concessions last year, as well as the large-scale publicity efforts, had yielded very good results. Cholera has already been discovered this year, so efforts should be continued promptly to protect the safety of citizens' lives. Furthermore, most of the gentlemen present are old friends, which is especially valuable. He expressed his hope that everyone would contribute to the epidemic prevention efforts so that today's meeting can achieve satisfactory solutions.</p>
<p>▲ Resolutions: (1) Representatives from the Central Cholera Prevention Office, the Municipal Health Bureau, the French Concession, and the Public Concession reported on the results of last summer's epidemic prevention efforts. (2) All parties will cooperate to continue the following: A. Establish a Central Epidemic Prevention Headquarters in Shanghai to oversee all relevant matters, with the Department of Health supervising its progress. B. If an epidemic is discovered, the relevant agencies should promptly investigate the location where it occurred and the family's situation. At the same time, the joint headquarters must be notified to send personnel to inspect everything to prevent the spread of the epidemic. A subcommittee should also be established to investigate various epidemic diseases. C. Establish a subcommittee to organize lectures, films, and other written publicity methods. (3) Conduct epidemic prevention injections for all Shanghai citizens. Hu Hongji announced that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau plans to inject at least one million people this year. The Public Concession and French Concession also expressed their willingness to assist as much as possible. The epidemic prevention vaccine for the Chinese concessions has been decided to be fully supplied by the Shanghai Health Laboratory. (4) Investigate, coordinate, and improve the equipment and resources of various hospitals in the city, as well as temporarily establish epidemic hospitals to provide places for preventing and treating epidemic diseases during the summer.

All of the above major cases have been resolved. Each representative present was instructed to immediately notify their respective administrative agencies to be responsible for handling them separately.</p>
<h3>Record of the Postal Remittance Bureau Supervisory Committee</h3>
<p>▲ Song Ziwen and Chen Mingshu Both Attended. The regulations of the Supervisory Committee of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau were previously formulated and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. All seven committee members, excluding the Minister of Transportation, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Audit, and the Director of the Postal Department as ex-officio members, the other three committee members were appointed by the Executive Yuan: Liu Shufan, Deng Ruiren, and Zou Minchu. The supervisory committee held its first meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Savings and Remittances Bureau. Minister of Transportation Chen Mingshu, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, Minister of Audit Ru Yuli, Director of the Postal Department Long Dafu, and committee members Liu, Deng, and Zou (Deng Ruiren as proxy) attended. Minister Chen chaired the meeting, reporting on the establishment of the committee. Yang Jianping, Director of the Savings and Remittances Bureau, reported on the business conditions of the past two years, stating briefly that although the development of the bureau's business since its official establishment in March of the previous year has not been entirely satisfactory, the results have also been considerable. The bureau's main businesses are remittances, savings, and investments. The business operations of the past two years have all improved. For example, the total amount of remittance drafts issued in the 18th year (i.e., before the establishment of the bureau) was over 13.3 million, and in the 20th year, it increased to over 16.1 million. Previously, the annual increase was no more than 5 million, but now it has increased by nearly 30 million. There are four reasons why it has increased so sharply: (1) Adding domestic remittance bureaus and offices; (2) Increasing the amount of remittances; (3) Adding small amount remittance drafts; (4) Reducing remittance fees. Regarding savings, the total amount of savings in the 18th year was only over 11.8 million, but in the 20th year, it increased sharply to over 27.6 million. The main reasons for the sharp increase were (1) Restoring and increasing savings post offices; (2) Adding various types of savings; (3) Paying attention to publicity and convenient methods for depositors. As for investments, a prudent approach has always been adopted, and cash reserves are kept sufficient, usually above 40%. The types of investments are divided into four categories: (1) Domestic and foreign government bonds; (2) Bonds of the Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin Municipal Councils and various public utility companies; (3) Real estate; (4) Mortgage loans and overdrafts. All account statements have been reported to the ministry for record. The bureau has only been established for two years, and it has coincided with floods and wars, and the finances of various places have been sluggish. However, even with these results, the future is unlimited. I have only been in office for more than three months, and it has coincided with the military affairs against Japan, and the market is depressed. Therefore, I have to adopt a tightening policy for business. For example, unimportant employees in the bureau have been laid off. In the future, we must strive for prudence in investment. Because savings are the hard-earned money of the common people, entrusted to the bureau for safekeeping. I will definitely take the interests of depositors and the development of the national economy as the premise. Afterwards, Committee Member Liu Shufan proposed that the bureau's accounts be audited and publicized to strengthen public trust. It was resolved to entrust Chen Riping as the accountant of the committee to audit and publicize the accounts. Also, because the committee's affairs are important, Ru Yuli, Liu Shufan, and Deng Ruiren were jointly elected as standing committee members to handle various matters during the recess of the committee.</p>

<h3>Meeting of the Zhabei Defense Corps</h3>
<p>▲ The First, Second, Seventh, and Eighth Squads Have Already Been Deployed for Defense ▲ Planning to Investigate, Register, Organize, and Consolidate. Wang Binyan, the head of the Zhabei Defense Corps, after our side took over the Fourth District Headquarters and the First and Second Sub-Offices, convened a temporary emergency corps affairs meeting at the Zhabei Corps Headquarters yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to restore the Defense Corps. The various circumstances are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ The Corps Affairs Meeting was attended by Corps Head Wang Binyan, Special Affairs Director Jiang Huaishu, Special Affairs Deputy Director Feng Yixian, Squad Leader of the First Squad Yu Xipin, Squad Leader of the Second Squad Xu Youtang, Squad Leader of the Third Squad Mo Meiqing, Squad Leader of the Fourth Squad Na Minyi, Squad Leader of the Fifth Squad Liu Changqi, Squad Leader of the Sixth Squad Hou Yuncai, Squad Leader of the Seventh Squad Chen Yuxin, Squad Leader of the Eighth Squad Lu Lilang, Squad Leader of the Ninth Reserve Squad Wang Delin, and Guard Squad Leader Li Xiuling. Wang Binyan presided over the meeting, and Li Xiuling recorded the minutes. First, the chairman reported on the assistance provided to the military and police during the war. Then, discussions began on (1) Corps Head Wang's proposal on how to restore the local Defense Corps. It was resolved to proceed with consolidation as soon as possible to facilitate restoration. (2) Special Affairs Director Jiang's proposal to actively investigate the original members of each squad and register any deaths and losses of firearms. The proposal was passed. (3) Squad Leader She's proposal to negotiate the dismantling and opening of the barbed wire on the Xinzhapu Bridge to facilitate traffic. The proposal was passed. (4) Squad Leader Mo's proposal that it is difficult to investigate corps members because some Japanese troops have not completely withdrawn. It was resolved to find ways to investigate. (5) The areas of the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Squads are difficult to restore because the Japanese troops have not withdrawn. It was resolved to start work. (6) Regarding the large number of firearms lost or privately hidden in the areas of the Seventh and Eighth Squads, how should they be handled? It was resolved that the squad leaders should find ways to collect them or purchase them with funds, and report to the corps headquarters beforehand. (7) The Beiping police are not familiar with the local situation and urgently need assistance to maintain order. The proposal was passed. (8) A letter from the flour industry stated that a lot of wheat flour being transported in the Suzhou River is being stolen, and they request defense to maintain commercial goods. It was resolved that the Ninth Squad should be deployed for defense.</p>
<p>▲ Restoration Plan. A reporter from the New Voice Press met Corps Head Wang Binyan yesterday and asked about the plan to restore the Zhabei Defense Corps. According to him, the Zhabei Defense Corps has eight squads, each with 100 members, six corps soldiers, one squad leader, three platoon leaders, and one clerk, totaling 112 people, as well as the Guard Squad, the Ninth Reserve Squad (i.e., the Water Patrol Squad). The total number is more than 1,000 people. When the Shanghai Incident occurred, they assisted the military and police in maintaining local order. After our army retreated, they followed to places such as Qingpu and Suzhou, and most of the firearms were transported out, so fortunately, there were few losses. However, the exercise of duties had to be temporarily suspended. Now that our side has taken over the jurisdiction of the four districts of Zhabei, we will immediately find ways to restore it. As for the restoration plan, the first step is to report the deployment, the second step is to investigate, the third step is to register, and the fourth step is to organize and consolidate. The previous regular expenses were 1,434 yuan per month, which was allocated by the municipal government. It was stopped after the Shanghai Incident. Now it has been decided to request temporary expenses from the municipal government, which should not be a problem. Starting yesterday, the members of the First Squad, Second Squad, Seventh Squad, Eighth Squad, and Ninth Reserve Squad in Shanghai have been deployed for defense. However, the Third Squad, Fourth Squad, Fifth Squad, and Sixth Squad have not been deployed because the Japanese troops have not withdrawn from their areas, but they have already reported for duty and will be restored after the withdrawal.</p>
<h3>Sending Refugees Back Home</h3>
<p>The Jia Ding Fellow Villagers Association on Avenue Joffre, in view of the fact that the Japanese troops in the county have withdrawn one after another and order has been restored as usual, has specially prepared many ships to send the fellow villagers who have taken refuge in Shanghai back home. The ships are under the Xinyang Bridge. The departure time depends on the tides. Those who want to take the ship can register with the association first so that they can be sent to the dock.</p>
<h3>The Flower and Yarn Industry Volunteer Army Returns from the Front Lines</h3>
<p>The Flower and Yarn Industry Volunteer Army of this city, after the January 28th Incident, was deployed to Pudong and was responsible for the transportation of supplies for the Shanghai Garrison. Later, they were ordered to be reorganized into the Protection Unit of the Transportation Department of the 19th Route Army, stationed in places such as Su Kun for work. It has been two months now, and with the situation coming to an end, they urgently need to be withdrawn for rest. Therefore, the district captain Lu Junlin led them back to Shanghai. They arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday. Due to other reasons, they changed their landing point to Pu Zuo. More than 100 people, including representatives of the Yarn Industry Association, the Cotton Industry Federation, the Women's Comfort Association, and local defense corps, went to the port to welcome them. The team members have been away from their hometowns for a long time and have endured hardships. One day, they returned to their hometowns, and they were all in high spirits. Then, Chen Zixin, the administrative committee member and defense corps leader of Yangsi Township, hosted a banquet. During the banquet, Chen delivered a welcoming speech, and squadron leader Yang Xixian expressed his gratitude and reported on the details of participating in the battle of the 19th Route Army. It is said that the army has been praised by the superiors for its past achievements and has received many firearms, military flags, commemorative medals, and awards, which are very precious.</p>
<h3>Report on the Tragic Spring Famine in Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng stated that the National Government Relief Association allocated 80,000 yuan to Jiangsu for spring relief, which was not enough to provide relief, so the association's Chairman Song telegraphed: To Chairman Song and Vice Chairman Xin of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, and Director Zhu of the Work Group, I acknowledge receipt of the Director's telegram allocating 80,000 yuan to Jiangsu to relieve the spring famine in the counties north of the Yangtze River. At this time of national difficulty, it is a great act to relieve the disaster-stricken people, and all who are aware cannot help but shed tears of gratitude. However, after investigating the counties north of the Yangtze River, the disaster is too heavy, and the spring famine is worse than the winter famine. Although winter relief has been implemented, if spring relief is not continued, deaths will follow one another at the time of the green and yellow unripened crops. This can be predicted early. Therefore, Jingsheng submitted a request in a supporting telegram in February of this year, which was not only listed as the reason for Jingsheng's resignation, but also predicted the situation that the spring relief would not be done and the previous efforts would be abandoned, as well as the situation that various groups would be unable to continue the relief. Later, on the Geng Day, Shan Day, Xin Day, and You Day in February, continuous telegrams were sent requesting at least 500,000 yuan for spring relief to select the most affected areas for relief. On Zheng Day in March, the methods for sending spring relief were resubmitted. At that time, the war was not over, and the association had difficulty raising funds and violated the reply telegram. Resignation was not allowed, but the increase in funds was beyond reach. The environment made it impossible to do anything but sigh. Recently, what Jingsheng predicted has unfortunately become a reality one by one. Therefore, there were requests again on Jing Day in April, Qin Day, and Dong Day of this month. The current state of misery and the cessation of life chances cannot be remedied by a small amount of relief funds. I would like to respectfully report to you separately (1) The current situation of the disaster victims in various counties cutting off food. In Xinghua, Gaoyou, and other counties, the winter relief has been exhausted, and there is no hope for spring wheat. They are digging and eating the mineral white soil (commonly known as Guanyin powder), which causes intestinal astringency and difficulty in bowel movements, and many people have died. In Dongtai, Yancheng, Fuyang, Shaobo, Baoying, Taixian, and other places, there is also little spring wheat. They eat perennial animals. After the aquatic products are exhausted, they continue to eat artemisia and other wild plants, and their faces are swollen. Those who die are gray in color and look like they have been poisoned. Moreover, gatherings of people to cause disturbances occur several times a day. Those who commit suicide by jumping into the river are often heard. In Huaiyin, Siyang, Huai'an, Tongshan, Xiaoxian, Pixian, Suqian, Yangzhou, Lianshui, Jiangpu, and Liuhe, the land is originally full of springs, and although wheat is planted, they cannot wait for it to ripen. They often use green seedlings to fill their stomachs, cutting off their own livelihood. The situation is very pitiful. According to reports, in the fourth district of Pixian County, more than 110 people starved to death on Dong Day of this month. In Xiaoxian County, there is a family that has committed suicide in a row, thousands and tens of thousands of people are running around and shouting, swimming and arriving, taking risks, and it is impossible to prevent them. The above situation is not only the case in four counties. In the cities, there are also many people who are cut off and waiting to die. (2) The reason why the amount of money is not enough for relief. The amount of money and goods from the winter and urgent relief, combined with the implementation of various groups, is about more than 3.6 million yuan, and there is still a shortage at times. Spring relief has always been considered to have more households than winter relief. In addition, after the war, not only those who used to live in the south of the Yangtze River and support themselves have returned one after another, but also those who have lived in Songhu for a long time and live by working have also returned to the north of the Yangtze River with the elderly and children, adding tens of thousands of unemployed people every day, adding to the number of people waiting for relief. Roughly speaking, those who cannot live without relief total more than 3 million people. If we talk about the situation, even if there are more than 3.6 million, the amount is still huge. Moreover, the groups have no money to help, and the 80,000 yuan issued by the association is only 1% or 2% of the urgent winter relief. If it is said to be strict elimination, it is actually impossible to eliminate. If it is said to be strict investigation, it is also impossible to investigate. Not only is it difficult to provide great relief, but it is also impossible to start. (3) The plan to select the best for relief. Since the association's relief funds are already very difficult, I dare to ask for 500,000 yuan to start with the above 19 counties. The severely affected counties can get 45,000 yuan, and the less severely affected counties can get 12,000 yuan. Depending on the local situation, either set up porridge factories, or still check households to give leaders, or still subsidize the incomplete embankment projects. Each county will first implement the most severe areas in the severely affected areas, and then ask various charities to raise funds to promote and cooperate in order to reduce deaths slightly, so that the desire for kindness can be achieved, and people can be saved completely, but only to delay death for a moment, to appease and appease, but to stop the chaos from sprouting slightly. If you are willing to approve, I will respectfully submit the grades of severity of the various counties separately, as well as the cooperation methods with the charities, for review and approval to see if they are appropriate. Respectfully awaiting your decision. Cheng Jingsheng, Commissioner of Jiangsu, Koutou, Han.</p>
<h3>Gao Youtang Replies to the Letter from the Anti-Drug Association</h3>
<p>Gao Youtang, a member of the Supervisory Yuan, replied to the letter from the Anti-Drug Association yesterday, stating: To the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, I acknowledge receipt of your letter while traveling in Los Angeles. It is an honor to receive your award, and I am deeply grateful. The impeachment of Liu Ruiheng was proposed in the fall of last year, but the government put it aside and did not deal with it. Recently, the Disciplinary Committee was established, and the Executive Yuan transferred it to the committee. Whether to punish him or not is the right of the committee. Currently, open cultivation, transportation, sale, and smoking are rampant in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Kaifeng, and it is heard that Hebei, Shanxi, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan are also thinking of following suit, raising funds in name, but in fact enriching themselves. My colleagues are collecting evidence and plan to impeach them one by one to fulfill their responsibilities. Whether the government can handle it according to law is difficult to predict. For me, I am only making the listeners aware of the warning. In the future, if your association obtains evidence, I hope you will teach me at any time, and I will be very welcome. I have received the papers in the monthly journal that you sent, and I have read them with admiration. I would like to express my thanks and wish you all the best. Gao Youtang, Qiqi.</p>
<h3>There are Four Articles in the Company Law Enforcement Act That Extend the Implementation Period</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Industry, stating that Article 11 of the Company Law Enforcement Act stipulates that stocks and bonds of limited companies that have not been signed and sealed by five or more directors should be signed and sealed by five or more current directors within one year after the implementation of the Company Law. Also, according to Article 6 of the same law, if the stock payment paid before the implementation of the Company Law is less than one-half of the par value of the stock, the insufficient part should be paid up in accordance with the law within one year after the implementation of the Company Law. According to Article 12, if a company issues bearer shares exceeding one-third of the total number of shares before the implementation of the Company Law, the excess number of shares should be changed to registered shares within one year of the implementation of the Company Law. According to Article 13, if the shares issued by a company before the implementation of the Company Law do not comply with the second provision of Article 115 of the Company Law, they should be corrected in accordance with the law within one year after the implementation of the Company Law. The amendment period for the aforementioned provisions will expire on June 30 of this year. Although many companies have followed and reported the corrections, there are also many who have not followed due to various difficulties. In order to understand the difficulties of businesses and to ensure that all companies comply with the new law, the Ministry has submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government for approval to extend the period by one year (i.e., extend the period to June 30, 1933). The bureau has ordered the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to notify all companies to follow the instructions.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs of Out-of-Stock Stores</h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Replied to Lawyer Zhou Xiao's Letter. The sale of a store is prone to disputes. According to Article 21 of the Merchant's General Rules, the transfer of a business name shall not be used to oppose a third party unless it is a transfer of registration. The legal provisions are very clear. Recently, a large merchant was involved in a lawsuit over the sale of a store, and Lawyer Zhou Xiao'an was handling the case. However, what are the customs of Shanghai merchants in this regard? We have sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inquire. The reply from the chamber is recorded below. (Dear Sir, I have received your letter, inquiring whether it is necessary to register the sale of a store according to Shanghai merchant customs after the sale, and whether this registration system is implemented in this city. We have sent personnel to investigate. The current situation in this city is that whether a store is registered or not depends on whether the store was registered with the Ministry of Industry before the sale. If it was registered before, it should still be registered after the sale so that a new certificate can be exchanged and the registered benefits can be continued. Otherwise, no registration procedures have been handled. If the store was registered with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for industry and commerce before the sale, it must also apply for registration with the Social Affairs Bureau after the sale and issue a business license to the purchaser. Otherwise, there is no need to go through the registration procedures. This is the case for general stores. As for whether the registration system is implemented in this city, the Ministry of Industry handles the registration of companies and businesses in order to understand the organization, capital, and business of the businesses and to protect all the legal interests of the businesses. There are no regulations that force businesses to register, so its authority is limited to those who have been registered. If they have not been registered, they are generally not consulted. Therefore, according to the current situation, the registration system and registration procedures have not been widely implemented. We hereby reply to you by letter, and please check.

<h3>Song Zigao Entices and Murders Fellow Villager</h3>
<p>▲ Previously Committed Murder and Escaped to Shanghai ▲ Sun Baohua Extorted Money and Was Killed Song Zigao, also known as Li Xingting, a native of Songjiang, worked as an inspector at the Kungsheng Yuan in the Nine Acres area. On the evening of the 24th of last month, he lured his fellow villager Sun Baohua, who resided at No. 84 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, to the Great World entertainment complex. He suddenly produced a bayonet and attempted to kill Sun, stabbing him in the neck. He then placed a forged suicide note in Sun's pocket and fled. The Great World reported the incident to the police, who sent Sun to Renji Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, Su Deshan, a detective from the special agency of the French police, discovered that Song was hiding in Room 24 of the Jiangxin Hotel in the Zhoujin Lane on the Fourth Road. On the 27th of the same month, they went to arrest him, but Song resisted arrest, causing Su's chest to be injured. He was eventually apprehended and taken back to the police station, then escorted to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The police have now learned that at the end of 1919, Song and Shen Aqin murdered a widowed woman surnamed Zhang and two others near the Xiuye Bridge outside the West Gate of Songjiang. After the incident, Shen was arrested and executed, while Song escaped to Anhui. In the spring of 1930, he came to Shanghai and worked at Kungsheng Yuan. Sun found out about this and frequently extorted money from Song, leading Song to harbor resentment and plot to kill Sun. On March 3rd, March 16th, and April 19th, he tricked Sun into writing a will under false pretenses and secretly stamped it with Sun's seal. Finally, on April 24th, he lured Sun to the Great World and carried out the murder, stabbing Sun in the neck with a bayonet and stuffing the forged will into Sun's pocket before fleeing. The police prepared a detailed report and are prosecuting him for premeditated attempted murder under Articles 284, Sections 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, Judge Xiong Huiping from the Third Criminal Court continued the hearing. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, requesting that the law be applied. The victim, Sun Baohua, who had recovered from his injuries and been discharged from the hospital, also appeared in court to testify about the circumstances of the attempted murder. When questioned, Song Zigao admitted to attempting to murder Sun Baohua and resisting arrest. He evaded the question regarding the murder case in Songjiang. The court reviewed the evidence and adjourned the hearing to a later date. The defendant was returned to custody. The Cao Qingcheng Assassination Case</p>
<h3>Dog Secures Two Murderers</h3>
<p>▲ Gun Found in Murderers' Room ▲ Defendant Claims Tao Guanzheng Masterminded the Assassination Cao Qingcheng, a native of Hubei who resided at No. 41 Yuansheng Lane, Route Lafayette in the French Concession and worked as an inspector at the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was shot and killed by assassins in front of No. 184 Carler Road at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. Two bullets struck his head, killing him instantly. At the same time, the assassins mistakenly wounded Jin Shoupei, a native of Jiangwan who lived at No. 25 in the same lane as Cao, in the abdomen and back. Detectives pursued and apprehended two of the murderers, seizing a handgun and twenty-one bullets from each. They were taken to the police station. Jin was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, and Cao's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan funeral parlor for an autopsy. Details of the case were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that during the night, the captured criminals were interrogated by the police chief. One, named Liu Guobao, 17 years old, from Sichuan, residing at No. 305 Weihaiwei Road, and the other, named Li Shiying, 22 years old, from Henan, with no fixed address, both confessed that Tao Guanzheng, who is still at large, masterminded the assassination. They stated that Tao resided at the Yanzhi (cigarette paper) store at No. 980 Huade Road in the Public Concession. The special agency immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives, together with Chinese and Western police officers from the Public Concession, to Tao's residence at No. 980 Huade Road. They seized two handguns, two pairs of handcuffs, two daggers, a saw, and acid, among other items. They also took the second landlord, Zhu Jinming, a native of Hangzhou, into custody. The following morning, Li Zecai, a native of Anhui, was apprehended at No. 305 Weihaiwei Road and brought to the police station. Because Tao had privately stockpiled weapons, and there was concern that he may have committed other crimes, the Public Concession Police sent the two handguns to the French Police for examination to determine if they had been used in any other crimes. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the Criminal Division of the French Police requested that the Second Special Court appoint Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke, accompanied by a forensic doctor, to examine the body and conduct an inquest. The presiding judge heard a report from the police chief and then heard a statement from Cao's widow, Mrs. Cao Hu, who said that her husband had gone out to buy a raincoat the day before and was tragically murdered. She sought justice. The official autopsy determined that Cao Qingcheng had died from gunshot wounds to the head sustained before death. The widow took custody of the body for burial. The arrested criminals will be sent to court for questioning. Subsequently, at 11:00 AM, the police escorted the four criminals to the Second Special Court, where Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu, along with Prosecutor Wu and Clerk Zhu Chengzhuo, conducted a preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court. Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, presented the case, stating that the police were temporarily prosecuting the defendants for premeditated murder under Articles 282 and 284, Section 1, of the Criminal Code. However, due to time constraints, the police had not yet completed their investigation and requested that the court adjourn the hearing for two weeks to allow for further investigation. The handguns, bullets, and other items were presented as evidence. Presiding Judge Wang briefly questioned the defendants. Liu and Li both confessed that Tao Guanzheng, who is still at large, had instructed them to carry out the assassination the day before. Zhu and Li both claimed to have no knowledge of the assassination. The court adjourned the hearing until May 31st, and the defendants were temporarily remanded to police custody. Yang Jingcun, a native of Anhui</p>
<h3>Accused of Abandonment and Assault</h3>
<p>▲ Defendant is the Nephew of the Late Military Governor ▲ Aunt Mrs. Yang Zhang Also Accused ▲ Plaintiff is a Former Courtesan and Yang's Concubine ▲ Demands Punishment, Compensation, and Divorce Yang Jingcun, a native of Anhui and nephew of the late Zhejiang Military Governor Yang Shande, and his aunt, Mrs. Yang Zhang, have recently been sued by Kong Chen, a 45-year-old woman from Zhenjiang residing at No. 2006 Fukang Lane, Hai'ning Road, North Zhejiang Road, along with her daughter Yang Kong, also known as Shujun, 24 years old. They have retained lawyer Zhao Zuwei to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing them of mistreatment, abandonment, and joint assault, along with a civil lawsuit. The facts of the complaint are as follows: the plaintiffs are a mother and daughter. Shujun initially worked as a courtesan, and the defendant Yang Jingcun often visited. Knowing that Shujun had some savings, he repeatedly enticed her, and they married in the first month of the lunar calendar two years ago. No bride price was paid, and no written contract was made. Initially, their love was strong, but over time, Yang grew tired of her. Because Shujun was physically weak and unwilling to prepare his opium pipes late into the night, he gradually saw her as a thorn in his side. Mrs. Yang Zhang, Jingcun's aunt, acted as his accomplice, constantly scolding and beating her, treating her like an enemy. The houses at No. 2006 to No. 2008 Fukang Lane are all owned by Jingcun. Shujun had deposited 300 yuan in her own name at the Four Banks Savings Society in June of the previous year and another 100 yuan in July, which were subsequently taken by Yang. When they moved into Fukang Lane, Yang refused to provide any household items, so Shujun used her own money to buy furniture and other items for their use. For the past two years, he has not provided any living expenses, which Shujun has covered with her own savings, spending over 1,000 yuan on household expenses. Now that her savings are depleted, the defendant not only shows no remorse but has intensified his abuse, constantly scolding and beating her. Her situation is so dire that she fears she will soon die. Even more unexpectedly, during the recent war, the plaintiff Kong Chen and her son Fan Kun came to Shanghai to seek refuge and temporarily lived with Shujun. On April 8th, for unknown reasons, the two defendants became angry and began scolding them from No. 2008 to No. 2006, and physically assaulted the mother and son. At the time, fearing their ferocity, they dared not retaliate. On the 18th, they again assaulted Kun in the lane. Kong Chen heard the commotion and went to investigate and was also beaten, causing her to bleed profusely. They called the police, who took her to a hospital for treatment and initiated a lawsuit. However, the police believed it was a domestic dispute and refused to represent them, leaving them with no recourse. The two defendants are guilty of assault under Article 293 of the Criminal Code and abandonment under Article 310 of the same code and should be severely punished according to the law. The defendants' actions are cruel and have completely severed any sense of obligation. It is impossible for Shujun to continue living with them, so she requests permission to sever her family ties with the defendant Mrs. Yang Zhang and requests that both defendants jointly compensate her with 200 yuan for medical expenses and 300 yuan for recuperation expenses. She also requests that Yang Jingcun return Shujun's savings of 400 yuan, the 2,200 yuan she spent on household expenses, and 20,000 yuan for alimony to support her life. The court accepted the case and issued a summons. Judge Feng Shide from the Second Criminal Court convened a hearing yesterday afternoon. Neither of the defendants appeared, nor did any lawyer represent them. The plaintiff's lawyer, Zhao Zuwei, stated that because the defendants had failed to respond to the summons, he requested that an arrest warrant be issued. Judge Feng briefly questioned the plaintiff and adjourned the case to a later date.</p>

<h3>Large Quantity of Red Pills Confiscated</h3>
<p>▲ Involving Two Post Office Employees ▲ Thirteen-Year-Old Ningbo Child Xu Jincheng was exploited between the 11th and 13th of this month to deliver 42 packages of printed materials from the Shanghai Huishuwu Publishing House, falsely named, to the North Sichuan Road Post Office, addressed to Xuzhou. Gao, an investigator at the post office, found that they all contained a large quantity of red pills. Xu was detained, and the Hongkou Police Station dispatched Chinese Detective Shi Enjian and Western Detective Hai'er to arrest him, along with the red pills, and bring them to the police station. After questioning, they learned that the red pill operation was located at No. 66 Ximen Road in the French Concession, and the main culprit was surnamed Zhou. They secretly went and, together with French police officers, arrested four men and women surnamed Zhu and escorted them to the Second Special District Court, while Zhou fled. The Hongkou Police Station escorted Xu to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, two more accomplices were apprehended: Lou Zhitian from Nanjing and Liu Desheng from Shanghai, both employees in the post office package room. Yesterday morning, they were also escorted to the First Court's Division A. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that the defendant Lou Zhitian was an employee of the North Sichuan Road Post Office, and Liu Desheng was employed at the Avenue Joffre Branch in the French Concession. In the adjourned hearing, Xu testified that those people had been asked to identify him. In January, those people delivered the same type of packages to Xuzhou. Those red pills, totaling 20 packages, were held up at the Nanjing Post Office due to the outbreak of war and have been telegraphed back and are now stored at the police station, for a total of 62 packages. He asked the court to question the defendants and first confiscate the red pills. When questioned, Xu testified that Liu Desheng hired a rickshaw puller to deliver the red pills to the main bureau, and Lou Zhitian checked the number of packages. The third time, because the matter had been exposed, Lou instructed me to take them back, but I was detained. I don't know what was inside. Lou Zhitian testified that a colleague surnamed Wang, who is still at large, also handled the matter and did not know that they were red pills, etc. Liu Desheng testified that he knew Xu because he had asked him to find business opportunities. Later, a colleague surnamed Chen introduced him to someone surnamed Zhou at No. 66 Ximen Road who had private printed books to send to Xuzhou. He initially refused, but later someone named Wang Lin at the main bureau agreed. Because the French Concession was strictly inspected, he asked Xu to send them to the main bureau, but [He] did not know [They] contained red pills. [Xu Jiahui Liu Desheng hired lawyer Liang Bohua, and Lou Zhitian hired lawyer Chen Ting. [Partially Obscured] Under lawyer [Partially Obscured] The Wan Huan Judge ordered all the defendants to be returned to custody, [Partially Obscured] The red pills, sixty-two packages in total, were confiscated first.</p>
<h3>Penalties for Opium Offenders</h3>
<p>▲ Two Women Sentenced to One Year ▲ Since the vigorous opium eradication campaign in the French Concession, a group of people who were in the business of running opium dens have found their livelihoods [Partially Obscured] Causing them to complain endlessly. They had to find other ways to make a living, so they secretly rented rooms in major hotels in the Public Concession to light lamps and provide opium for people to smoke. At around 8:00 PM the night before last, the Anti-Narcotics Department of the Public Concession Police learned that Room 415 of the Greater China Hotel on Tibet Road was being used as a secret opium den to allow people to smoke opium. Chinese Detective Song Bingzheng, Detective Zhang Shaoqing, Ding Yugao, and Western Detective Pan Gensi secretly went to the room and arrested the two people lighting the lamps, Jin Shiji and Ma Youcai, and eight opium smokers: Yang Huadi, Hu Liquan, Lu Baohua, Xi Shengbao, Ni Zhushi, Yang Xishi, and others. Along with 36 taels of opium paste, three opium lamps, two opium pipes, and one opium tray, they were taken to the Old Gate Police Station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated that Jin and Ma were prosecuted under Article 10 of the Anti-Opium Law, while the remaining defendants were prosecuted under Article 11 of the Anti-Opium Law, requesting that they be held accountable. When questioned, all the defendants denied the charges except for Jin Shiji, who admitted to selling opium. Ni Zhushi even hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to defend her. Presiding Judge Zhou Han reviewed the evidence and sentenced Jin Shiji and Ma Youcai to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan each. Xi Shengbao was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for assisting. The remaining defendants were sentenced to one month of imprisonment each.

<h3>Peace of Mind Senior Monk's Rare Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>Ningbo Senior Monk Peace of Mind, family name Fu, second in the family, courtesy name Yanyun, started out in the rice business. After the age of sixty, he suddenly had a great enlightenment, wore robes and became a monk, presided over the Baiyi Chan Temple in Ningbo, and served as the fundraising director for the Buddhist orphanage. He has traveled to Nanyang, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Burma, India, and other places, raising millions of yuan each year, which he immediately remitted to local officials for orphanage education expenses to show that he was not selfish. Wearing simple robes, he visited the Four Famous Mountains. Last year, during the Shaanxi disaster, he raised a large sum of money and went to Shaanxi with General Zhu Ziqiao to provide disaster relief, saving many lives. This year, the eighteenth day of the fourth lunar month is the Senior Monk's 70th birthday. Gentlemen in Ningbo and Shanghai have each contributed cash to celebrate the Senior Monk's birthday. The money will be used to establish a farm and dormitories for the orphanage. The event is a benevolent act, and sponsors are extremely enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>The State of Education in Taicang After the Flood and War</h3>
<p>▲Deficit of 70,000 to 80,000 Yuan ▲Temporary Austerity Measures ▲Approved by Meeting The education expenses in Taicang, Jiangsu Province, have become difficult to manage. Last summer, it suffered from floods, and this spring, it was affected by war. The local finances are extremely depleted. For the 20th year, about 30,000 yuan of education funds for the first semester are in arrears and have not been paid. In addition, there are outstanding interest-bearing debts of more than 20,000 yuan to the financial sector. The two items total about 60,000 yuan. If based on this year's budget, more than 80,000 yuan is still needed for various budget items in this semester, totaling more than 140,000 yuan. However, according to the Finance Bureau, only more than 60,000 yuan of overdue education expenses have not been collected, resulting in a shortfall of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. How to make up for this huge deficit is a major problem at present. On the afternoon of the 11th, the reporter specifically interviewed Mr. Hui Meishan, the Director of the Education Bureau. His remarks are recorded below. According to Director Hui, the county's education expenses are extremely exhausted. Seeking new sources of income is not permitted by the facts. Considering the situation, it is necessary to reduce expenditures. Regarding the organization of this bureau, in accordance with the latest standards issued by the Department (Grading Standards and Expenditure Table for Education Bureaus in Various Counties), austerity will be implemented first. The administrative expenses of this bureau after the austerity will be more than 400 yuan per month, only one-third of the previous administrative expenses. Other schools and social education institutions have been suspended since this semester. All principals and directors will be granted leave without pay in this semester, imitating the example of Baoshan County (the teachers of various schools and the staff of various social education institutions may also follow this example). All school and institution buildings, stationery, and other items will still be entrusted to the personnel on leave to properly manage. Starting from May, the bureau will raise and distribute custodial fees on a monthly basis. If there is an immediate need to open schools due to environmental needs, schools and institutions will be established in accordance with the prescribed standards, realistically and pragmatically. Supplementary funding will be provided from the collection of overdue items in the 21st year, and maintenance fees and business expenses will be taken into account. While implementing austerity, the intention is to actively strive for progress. With this approach, if the overdue education expenses can be fully collected in the near future, the past income and expenses can be offset, and the difficult situation thereafter can gradually improve. He also presented a brief record of the austerity measures decided by the Education Administration Committee on the 9th of this month, as follows: A. Elementary Schools (by school) Monthly Custodial Fee Total Custodial Fees for All Levels Single Grade: 3 yuan 273 Two Grades: 4 yuan 76 Three Grades or More: 5 yuan 45 Total: 394 B.

<h3>Shanghai Education After January 28th (6) Still</h3>
<p>▲Schools Maintain Classes | Spirit Rejuvenated</p>
<h3>9. Maintaining the Reopening of Schools</h3>
<p>With lingering fears gradually suppressed, a sense of responsibility gradually emerged, spurring action. By late February, teachers from various troubled areas converged in Shanghai to discuss maintaining the reopening of schools. Shanghai Law College and Fudan Practical High School relocated to the shores of West Lake to hold classes. The affiliated high school of Jinan University moved to the city of Suzhou and hung up its school sign. In addition to opening classes in the concessions, the university headquarters also established a branch in Guangzhou. Sanmin Elementary School sought refuge in Nanhui. Of the remaining 130-plus schools, those with the means rented alternative premises in the special district, including more than ten schools such as Labor University, China Public School, Central Business College, Provincial Shanghai High School, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, China Women's Physical Education School, and Nanyang Commercial College. Those without the means had to temporarily merge with existing schools in the special district. Those with neither the means nor any other options had to temporarily close down. The funding for maintenance varied depending on the history, content, activities, and number of students of each school. The luckiest were the Minli High School near Nanmen and the Nanyang High School near Shihui Bridge. Unlike other schools, these two schools opened early, a week before the outbreak of gunfire in Zhabei. Almost all of their students had paid their fees and packed their belongings to enter the school, reciting the classics and the ABCs with confidence. Schools that opened after January 28th found that students were not always understanding of the painstaking efforts of the administrators, and were hesitant to attend classes, resulting in temporary classrooms that were not as bustling as before, with many schools sparsely populated. However, Jinan, Labor, China Public, Shanghai High, Nanyang Model, Jiaotong University and other schools had a considerable number of students. Although the initial war zone was in Zhabei, the impact extended beyond the city of Shanghai. Even youth middle schools in the special district temporarily served as apartments to accommodate fellow citizens in distress. The Youth Association Middle School, Peide Girls' Elementary School, and Tonghui Elementary School, among others, were converted into refugee shelters or wounded soldier hospitals. Moreover, in areas outside of the French Concession and the South Shanghai District, such as Pengpu, Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Zhenru, Caoging, Gaogiao, and Fahua, about 50 municipal schools were affected by the war and found it difficult to maintain operations. Schools in areas without troops stationed or artillery fire also had few students for a time. Therefore, among the schools that historically opened around February 3rd or 4th, and continued without interruption, there were likely only a handful, apart from the Municipal Bide Elementary School in the French Concession and a few schools in rural areas. However, even if schools were forced to delay opening, or temporarily suspend classes, or had few students, they immediately resumed classes whenever the opportunity arose. This indomitable spirit of struggle was truly admirable. With the municipal government's revenue plummeting, the initial period of the war was extremely difficult. The monthly operating expenses of the Municipal Education Bureau, originally stipulated at 102,500 yuan, fell to 20,000 yuan. How could this amount be allocated to more than 200 affiliated institutions? In the midst of countless difficulties, the authorities devised an impossible solution to barely maintain operations. This solution was as follows: 1. All municipal primary and secondary schools, except for single-grade elementary schools, would temporarily postpone opening, and teachers and staff would remain on leave without pay. 2. During the period of postponement, schools would handle matters separately according to the following regulations: A. Secondary Schools: (1) The principal of each school would receive a living allowance of 40 yuan and be responsible for the full custody of the school. (2) Each school should retain one clerk, with a monthly living allowance of 30 yuan. (3) Each school should retain two workers each for Wuben and Jingye, four for Xinlu (including two gardeners), two for Wusong, and two for Yangjing, with a monthly salary of 12 yuan per person. (4) All other teachers and staff would remain on leave without pay. (5) The office expenses for each school would be determined as follows: 10 yuan per month for Wuben and Jingye, and 5 yuan per month for Xinlu, Yangjing, and Wusong. B. Elementary Schools: (1) Principals with an original salary of 40 yuan or more would receive a living allowance of 40 yuan; those with less than 40 yuan would receive their original salary and be responsible for the custody of the school. (2) Schools with 12 or more grades should retain one clerk, with a monthly living allowance of 30 yuan. (3) Each school should retain a certain number of custodians: one for schools with six grades or fewer, two for schools with more than six but fewer than twelve grades, and three for schools with more than twelve grades. The monthly salary would be 12 yuan per person in the South Shanghai and Zhabei districts, and 8 yuan per person in other districts. (4) All other teachers and staff would remain on leave without pay. (5) Single-grade elementary schools, except those in the war zone, would open classes as usual, and their office expenses would be temporarily paid from the school construction fund, set at 5 yuan per month. (6) Schools with two or more classrooms that were not in the war zone could continue to operate as usual if they could use the school construction fund revenue to maintain operations after the bombing of the office of the factory department of the French National Labor University. The school would formulate detailed measures and submit them to the bureau for approval. (7) The office expenses for each school would be 3 yuan per month for schools with six grades or fewer, 4 yuan per month for schools with more than six but fewer than twelve grades, and 5 yuan per month for schools with more than twelve grades. Rent and telephone expenses would be provided separately. Besides the above measures, there were indeed no more appropriate solutions. However, schools relied solely on school construction funds for maintenance, and every school complained bitterly. For example, the Municipal Wanzhu Elementary School had 28 grades, and according to the standard, it should have received 560 yuan in administrative expenses, but now it received a total of 5 yuan, including everything. No wonder the administrators were working harder than ever. They were envious of the teachers at Jiaotong University, the only one, who were not in arrears of their salaries. One People's Education Center: 25 yuan Second People's Education Center: 12 yuan Simple People's Education Center: 10 yuan Arts and Crafts Training Center: 12 yuan Experimental District: 12 yuan Women's Vocational School: 3 yuan Agricultural Education Center: 8 yuan Tea Garden Night School, etc.: temporarily suspended Total: 82 yuan E. Total Expenses: Elementary Schools: 394 yuan Complete Elementary Schools: 100 yuan Secondary Schools: 49 yuan Social Education: 82 yuan Other Uses: 600 yuan Total: 1225 yuan (Note) 1. The monthly expenses of the Education Bureau are not included. 2. Subsidies for various schools and social education institutions are suspended across the board. This city</p>

<h3>Jingye Xinlu Normal School Students Visit and Practice</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the annual increase in municipal elementary schools in the Shanghai area, there has been a sense of a shortage of qualified teachers. The Municipal Education Bureau, aware of this, has not only established normal departments in the senior high schools of the Municipal Jingye Middle School and Wuben Women's School, but also created the Xinlu Normal School. This summer, the first group of students from Jingye and Xinlu will graduate and, as usual, will participate in visits and internships to gain experience. It is reported that the level of this year's graduates is quite complete. When they serve in schools in the future, the municipal schools will be more vigorous and energetic with the addition of this new force.</p>
<h3>Practical Night School Promotes Industrial Salvation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Practical Vocational Night School, recognizing the urgent need for various construction projects in the country today, has established an engineering drawing department in the school, in addition to organizing the Oriental Construction Company. It started with a series of architectural drawing classes, and the students were very enthusiastic. It has now hired architects Huang Yixuan and Huang Zengmu to preside over the classes. A correspondence department has also been established, inviting famous teachers Wang Qinzhi and Gan Weilian to preside over it. The fees are low, and the graduation period is short, to broaden the career or further education opportunities for secondary school youth.

<h3>A Letter to People Interested in Education and Forestry in Jiangsu (1)</h3>
<p>Li Yingong respectfully submits this letter. Yingong has been in charge of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Forest from April of the 17th year of the Republic to February of the 21st year, a period of less than four years. Although I have worked diligently in the public interest, I am afraid that there are still areas where I have not been able to meet people's expectations. I would like to briefly explain this. Initially, the forest area was repeatedly ravaged by bandits, and the buildings and gardens were in a state of widespread dilapidation. The forests were also in a similar condition. Anyone involved in the matter could speak to this. After I took over, I carefully formulated annual plans, revised the methods, and strived to improve efficiency in business. Therefore, I did not hesitate to use all the funds (at that time, the annual fee was 30,800 yuan, which was later increased to 32,000 yuan), with nine-tenths used for the forest area business, and one-tenth allocated for necessary administrative and miscellaneous expenses. This is detailed in the past annual reports, so there is no need to list them all. Generally, people in Jiangsu feel that education funds are scarce and are ignorant of forest management principles. There are occasionally criticisms that are too demanding and far removed from the facts. Yingong has never taken offense. However, it is not convincing for people in the education field to echo these sentiments (I recall that last year, a certain person copied a friend's outdated and decaying newspaper from the previous year and used it to stir up trouble and incite a revolt to sell his disruptive skills). I want to be able to explain myself, but how can I? I will discuss the points of misunderstanding below. (1) Pruning pine trees, according to planting statistics, the cost should yield huge profits (Answer) This is too idealistic. After trees are densely planted, side branches have few opportunities to flourish. How is it different for young pine trees? Pruning pine trees is not a necessary procedure in nurturing them. Even if pruning is advocated, it should not be done for trees under ten years of age. Moreover, if the pruning is not done properly, it can easily leave dead knots, which will directly reach the heartwood, causing unlimited losses. The reason why the education forest occasionally prunes is to cut down lower branches to isolate weeds to help prevent fires, and to use the branches to accumulate and sell, which can help increase income. The amount of pruning per year follows established precedents, and the forest area, which was established early on, supervises the forest workers to select for pruning, or adopts the method of branch division by rural farmers. The area is about 2,000 mu per year, in order to produce good timber from those pruned. Beyond this, there is no need for pruning. Those that are too overgrown will be thinned. However, the trees planted in the earliest period of the education forest have not yet reached the age of thinning (The age of ordinary forest trees reaches about 20 years before thinning is considered). The education forest was only established in the fifth year of the Republic, and the trees in the first forest area are still under 15 or 16 years old, not to mention others. As for pruning miscellaneous trees, it is not always necessary, or for natural forests, once every five or seven years, then it belongs to the reorganization work to promote growth and is not concerned with profit.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Plummets</h3>
<p>▲Decline Reaches Seventeen Taels ▲Impacted by the Death of the Japanese Prime Minister</p>
<p>The gold exchange reopened yesterday, though hit hard by the news of the Japanese Prime Minister's passing. Gold prices dropped sharply, though the morning and afternoon markets did not change much. The difference between the initial and final prices was fourteen taels, with the total drop reaching seventeen taels. It initially plummeted twenty taels, then broke through 690 taels. This was largely due to the assassination and subsequent death of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, leading to fears of a worsening world situation. The rise in silver prices further fueled panic. As foreign exchange rates shifted from deficit to equilibrium, those covering their positions in the industry entered the market, causing the gold price to rebound by ten taels. The afternoon market initially returned to 700 taels but later weakened. Exchange rates appeared to strengthen. The day's situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Opening Plunge of Twenty-Four and a Half Taels</p>
<p>The seven-month contract opened at 690.5 taels, a plunge of 24.5 taels. Large bars of silver rose by 16/1, with the price of silver rising a total of 7/8 in two days, and private telegrams adding 3/4. It then rebounded by three taels to 93.5 taels due to successful purchases by Yuanheng, Wanxing, and Shunli. Soon after, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Hongkang, Yongyuan, and Dayong all sold, exacerbated by a weakening US dollar. The August initial price of 32.5 yuan plummeted by six taels to 87.5 taels. Hengyu, Hengxing, Fuyu, Shunli, and Neixing bought in, and HSBC absorbed half a yuan of August US dollars, reaching 95.5 taels at 9:30 AM. British gold was up half a penny, and the US dollar at 75, retreated to 93 taels. Afterwards, Fuyu, Zhifeng, Yongyi, Fengyong, Hengxing, Tongchun, Yuanheng, Xiehing, and Yong competed to buy again. US dollars for June at 75 and September at 32.25 were eagerly purchased by banks. At 10:15 AM, it reached 99 taels, fluctuating by only one or two taels.

At 11:40 AM, it was at 97 taels, and remained flat thereafter. The noon closing price was 97 taels and seven qian, with the listed price changed to 768 taels, with a squeeze of 72.3 taels. The noon closing price was 70 taels.</p>
<p>▲Afternoon Market Continues to Decline</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 701 taels, then 701.5 taels. The Dalian gang and Hengyu initially bought actively. Later, Zhifeng, Yonghong, and Kangyong sold. The August US dollar initially absorbed 32 yuan, then sold at the same price. Pan Gen bought 0.25 for September, so the gold price fell by four or five taels to 696 taels and eight qian at 2:20 PM. Later, Yuanmao, Yongheng, Hengyu, Dadecheng, and Yifengyong competed to buy, and September US dollars could be sold at 1.25, causing morale to rise, reaching 700 taels and three qian around 3:00 PM. Suddenly, small amounts appeared, fluctuating by two taels. At 4:00 PM, Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, and Chengyongyong had strong selling pressure, and September US dollars were trading at 1.25, causing the gold price to plunge by four taels to 96 taels and two qian at 4:10 PM.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Rise in Both Official and Unofficial Markets</h3>
<p>▲Chinese Merchants Dumping to Cover IOUs</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market continued to rise, and exchange rates rose again. HSBC's listed rates had already risen by two notches, with British gold up half a penny to one shilling and eight and a half pence, and US dollars up 0.75 to 31.25 yuan. Hong Kong remained unchanged at 77 taels, Indian exchange rose 2.5 yuan, French francs rose 22, German exchange added 3.5 marks, and Japanese yen added 2.25 shields. Singapore dollars fell by 3.25 taels. Although the internal situation of the banks was also easing, it was not as drastic as the gold market's plunge. Because of the assassination of the Japanese Prime Minister, the gold market plummeted by over 20 taels. It was loose in the morning, then recovered slightly, and hardened again in the afternoon. The result was that British gold rose by 0.3125 and US dollars rose by only half a yuan compared to last Saturday. Chinese gold merchants tended to dump, mostly covering IOUs, with US dollars totaling about 1.1 million yuan. Yufengyong and Chengyongyong were the most active, and the Dalian gang and speculators also sold, but few settled. Banks' buying interest was still strong, and settlement prices were squeezed because the top cover was 42-43 taels away. British gold trading was extremely sluggish.</p>

<h3>Discount and Loan Rates Flagging</h3>
<p>▲Tight Collection</p>
<p>▲Market Overview</p>
<p>Foreign discount rates are weak and stagnant. Prolonged stagnation in this area is an obstacle to the revival of the market atmosphere. For several days now, the atmosphere has been devoid of activity. Furthermore, the past two days, due to the week and Advent, the exchanges were closed for two days, making the situation all the more bleak. Although business resumed as usual yesterday, trade was not very busy, apart from foreign banks slightly busier with collection procedures.</p>
<p>▲Discount Rates (Foreign Discount)</p>
<p>In the morning, both supply and demand were competitive, but the existing surplus was difficult to avoid, resulting in a drop of 1.125 qian to 7.01 qian. The afternoon market was the same. (Silver Discount) The morning and afternoon markets were both 5%, slightly better than the previous day's afternoon market, but there was no hope of a surge. The markup was 8%, and banks did not list prices.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions</p>
<p>Jiangnan small silver coins, due to having a source but not being able to be sold, shouted for a small price, in order to sell them, and as a result, they suddenly fell by 0.05 qian, to a trading price of 6.05 qian. Morning trading was at 4,000 jiao, and the afternoon market at 6,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver coins were also small in the morning. Because the foreign discount rate trended down, so did it, to 5.99775 qian, and then entered the 6 qian mark. The afternoon market rebounded by 0.015 qian, to 6.00875 qian, similar to the previous day. Morning trading was at 220,000 jiao, and the afternoon market at 90,000 jiao. Copper coins were still at 419,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the inflow and outflow of silver funds appeared to be higher among foreign merchants due to the two-day closure. Bills collected amounted to 3,340,000, and various goods, exchange drafts, and miscellaneous items collected amounted to 4,890,000. Telegraphic transfers amounted to over 800,000, and warehouse entries were 700,000. Chinese merchants collected over 2,330,000 in bills, exchange drafts and miscellaneous items over 2,600,000, goods funds collected over 1,400,000, customs duties collected over 700,000, telegraphic transfers over 400,000, and warehouse exits were 500,000. Money shops and silver guilds collected over 31,100,000, markups collected over 4,400,000, various remittance funds collected over 600,000, and cash received over 300,000. (Foreign Funds) In the market, the early market of exchange draft marking was 290,000, the afternoon market was 580,000, the money market had only 10,000 in the afternoon market, while the outside market had 140,000 in the early market and 50,000 in the afternoon market.

<h3>Government Bonds Suddenly Drop by About One Yuan</h3>
<p>▲Trading Volume Exceeds 2.8 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 17th), various bond market conditions in the Chinese Securities Exchange. Although several spot markets opened, except for approximately 10,000 for '96' and 'Entire 6', the rest were only several thousand yuan, totaling 32,000 yuan. In the futures market, price fluctuations were significant, and buying and selling activity was quite lively, making market conditions far better than before. The morning saw 1.28 million yuan, and the afternoon saw over 1.5 million yuan, totaling 2,855,000 yuan. Among these, unified salt tax bonds of 20 volumes each accounted for 47-480,000 yuan, while others also totaled over 300,000 yuan. However, '96', customs duties, and retrenchment were very quiet. As for the trend of various bond prices, in the early morning, the market showed no changes, and prices continued to hover. Fluctuations were very slight compared to the previous day. Suddenly, market sentiment weakened, and selling transactions were particularly active. Although buyers were not inactive, the situation of supply exceeding demand was very obvious. Consequently, prices of various bonds fell sharply in unison, dropping about one yuan more than in the morning, and each fell by a little 0.7-0.8 jiao to one yuan or more compared to the previous day. Only financial prices remained slightly firm. The reason for the price drop was that changes in the Japanese political situation and the future of Sino-Japanese diplomacy were generally predicted to be unfavorable.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Shows Slight Rebound</h3>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Bank)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, the New York Stock Market opened with quotes lower than those of Saturday. Later, news of rising wheat prices buoyed sentiment, and seasoned traders seized the opportunity to buy. As the market neared closing, short positions were covered, further improving the atmosphere. The closing price was generally higher than the previous day, with industrial stocks averaging a gain of 1.48 pounds. The main concerns in yesterday's market were the sharp falls in the Japanese yen and government bonds. Cotton piece goods prices also fell, but because the rise in wheat prices was a stronger influence, it had no impact. However, yesterday's price improvements should not be considered stable, as there are still many negative factors. For example, the dividend reduction of the "DuPont de Nemours" company to one dollar is more than enough to offset the rise in wheat prices. Although everyone is hoping for continued and greater improvements, unless there is good economic news, it is uncertain whether yesterday's prices can hold.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Markets Sluggish</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is again in a stagnant state, with an extremely loose situation. This is because, after extreme activity, there must naturally be a period of rest. Therefore, there is less demand from various yarn groups, resulting in demoralization. However, the situation of various factories is better. So, realistically speaking, the price of 154-155 taels for standard yarn should be sustainable. However, those outside the industry see business as not improving and are still cautious, and new entrants have not yet enthusiastically entered the market, so the market atmosphere is wavering. However, in this unfavorable surrounding environment, the power to rise is very difficult. The current situation still does not escape the realm of hovering.</p>
<p>▲Human Standard Morning Good, Afternoon Return</p>
<p>Before the opening of the human standard morning market, because the price of gold trended down and the Japanese case was very big with their financial chaos, most people were watching for a fall. Unexpectedly, American cotton rebounded and the market atmosphere rose, with prices rising by 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 qian for each month. In the afternoon, hearing that actual demand was calm, the market situation was slightly tired, with each falling 0.01-0.04 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 3,050 bales. It was found that Yikang sold 200 bales, Changfeng 250 bales, Yiyu 350 bales, and Heshen 100 bales. Jifeng bought 150 bales, Yongchang 500 bales, Mingde 150 bales, and Changji 150 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>▲Spot Yarn Consumption Turns Light</p>

Prices fell by 0.025 to 0.05 qian.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Supported by American Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned upward, but on the previous day, most people thought that the Japanese incident could cause the gold price to fall sharply, so there were more short sellers. Unexpectedly, American cotton rebounded and rose by 0.20 pounds, causing the market atmosphere to turn around. Sellers in the market were lacking. However, the gold market is trending down, so the future still depends on foreign cotton for advancement or retreat.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Standard Rises by 0.02-0.03 Qian</p>
<p>Although the gold price fell at the opening of the Zheng Standard morning market, foreign cotton rose, reversing the weak market conditions of the previous day and making it tight. Buying interest in the market was higher, with prices rising by 0.015 qian for each month. The market atmosphere was still good in the afternoon, with prices rising by another 0.01 qian for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 9,300 dan. It was found that Ruiyuan sold 400 dan, Yuanda 700 dan, Yu Chang 400 dan, Renfeng 300 dan, Dafeng 300 dan, Changhe 700 dan, and Changfeng 900 dan. Yikang bought 300 dan, Yicheng 300 dan, Yongchang 900 dan, Hengyi 600 dan, Daji 600 dan, and Shenyu 900 dan. The Zheng Standard closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>▲Raw Cotton Absolutely No Opening</p>
<p>Existing cotton mills are stopping sales, and there has been no news of opening.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rebounds by Twenty Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to pressure from sellers, but then strengthened due to excessive rainfall and short covering. Futures rose by 0.19 to 0.21 pounds, and spot prices rose by 0.20 pounds. British Indian cotton markets were closed. The original telegram records are on the left. (Telegram on the 16th)</p>

<p>Previous Week's American Cotton</p>
<h3>Gradually Entering a State of Chaos</h3>
<p>A New York telegram from May 13 reported on the cotton market situation for the week: Raw cotton buying has gradually decreased this week. The price increases of last week have lost some of their buying momentum due to scattered selling and liquidation. Due to disappointing securities market conditions, reports of smooth progress in Southern cotton crops, and the uncertainty of various bills in Congress, Southern spot conditions have not eased. It is heard that demand is sluggish and there are not many sellers. Traders have stopped May deliveries, and it is rumored that about 20,000 bales of cotton for New York May delivery will be shipped to Germany and Liverpool. Temperatures are still causing concern in many places, as dry weather is currently conducive to cotton crop development. At the same time, there is still bullish sentiment, based on the fact that prices are already low and a bumper cotton harvest may not be possible. This sentiment can be seen in the slight buying when market prices fall.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Markets - Tea Market Downtrend Unabated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign merchant tea market in this port, both road tea and local tea, the Zhenmei green tea from firms such as Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tongfu, all had sporadic purchases, but because the incoming prices from abroad were too low, and the exchange rate continued to be high, the recognized prices were even more stringent than before. The city-wide transactions of Zhenmei and Zhenmei needle tea totaled over 460 cases, and the selling price fell again by two to three taels compared to the previous day. As for Qimen, Fuliang, and Jiande road black tea, 11,754 cases have already arrived. After two days of lengthy negotiations between Chinese and foreign parties, new prices have still not been announced, and the situation is quite pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Yushan Green Tea Opens at High Price</h3>
<p>The Yushan and Shangrao areas of Jiangxi Province have always been known for their abundant tea production. Recently, large quantities of new goods have been launched on the market in places such as Zhengjiafang and Zhangcunjie. Foreign firms, due to making significant profits last year, continue to work tirelessly despite the frequent alarms of banditry. According to news from that area, the Zhengjiafang first-grade spring tea has already opened, with a price of 52 yuan per dan, which is 15-16 yuan higher than last year. However, it is said to be tender, and the quality seems better than in previous years.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Markets Uniformly Tighten</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday, the rice market in southern Shanghai had very few sources from various groups, only about 10, and the stock in Puxi was still scarce. City and rural store sales were affected because the end of the small month had just passed, and the goods were weak, leading to a further increase in the price of thick japonica rice. The price of thin early double-crop rice was bleak. Although sales were small, the price of brown rice in the interior rose, and the market price continued to harden, increasing by more than 0.2 yuan. The path for white glutinous rice was insignificant. Glutinous rice was still in high demand by wineries, and the price rose by nearly 0.1 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, the west road in northern Shanghai had more than 10 sources, but the store appetite in this city was not smooth. Also, due to the rainy weather, sentiment was weak, and the price of thick japonica rice was sluggish in the early market. By the time of the late market, the foot of the rice container turned active, and the surface temporarily did not move. Not much thin rice arrived. There was a slight social event for foreign customers. The opening price was reduced by 0.2 yuan. The white glutinous rice road was sparse, showing a soft appearance. The buy-in of shadowed yuan was quite vigorous, and the large plate suddenly rose by 0.1-0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Foreign Rice Released in June and July</h3>
<p>▲ The current digestion of foreign rice is very active, and the price has increased by nearly a corner. Yesterday, the foreign rice market was very active in sales. In addition to the inland areas of this street continuing to purchase, the Hankou and Jiangbei gangs were also searching for purchases in the market. The market price immediately rose by nearly a corner. The reported prices were: 13,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice, priced at 10 yuan and 6.5 jiao to 10 yuan and 3.5 jiao; 300 bags of Xiaojiao brown rice, priced at 9 yuan and 7.5 jiao; 500 bags of Min Dang rice, priced at 11 yuan; 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice, priced at 11 yuan and 7.3 fen to 11 yuan and 7 jiao. In the afternoon, a foreign company released a large batch of futures, and people's hearts and the market trended downward. These futures are all new transactions after the war. It is estimated that Xiangmao released 500 tons of Saigon No. 1 rice for the second half of June, with long grains priced at 5 liang and 4.5 qian, and round grains priced at 5 liang and 5.5 qian. Taihe Foreign Company sold 4,000 tons of Saigon No. 1 rice to the Nanjing gang for delivery in Nanjing in July, at the same price. In addition, this street and foreign companies sold a batch of cargo, including 2,000 bags of Min Dang rice, priced at 11 yuan; 1,000 bags of red Xiaojiao rice, priced at 9 yuan and 8.7 fen; and 1,000 bags of Kachiradi brown rice, priced at 9 yuan and 8.5 fen, all to be delivered within two weeks, and all taken in by this street. 200 tons of recovered Xiaojiao rice were opened, priced at 5 liang to 4 liang and 9.8 fen.</p>
<h3>Flour Firm at First, Then Trending Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was initially firm but then declined, with a trend of weakness. Initially, the weather was overcast and rainy, and foreign wheat was quoted at 4.5 jiao higher, leading to optimistic sentiment. Later, as the weather turned clear, a new ship of foreign wheat arrived, and the mills released futures, causing market prices to immediately weaken. The overall market transactions were light, and hoarders were watching, with actual consumption stagnating. The market may continue to decline slightly. The initial price for this month's military vessel flour was 2 liang, 0 fen, and 3.5 li, which decreased by 2.5 li and then fell from 2 liang, 0 fen, and 2.75 to 2 liang, 0 fen, and 2.5 at the close. The old brand flour was quoted by this street at 2 liang, 0 fen, and 4.25, decreasing to 2 liang, 0 fen, and 3.75, and closing at 2 liang and 4 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods, Xiamen Kumquat Cakes Have Arrived</h3>
<p>Xiamen kumquat cakes have not been transported for a long time, and the previous goods had already been sold out. It has been found that 15 cases of boxed goods arrived on the Hanyang Wheel the day before yesterday. Samples were seen yesterday. The cakes are soft and have a reddish color, which can be called top grade. It is said that the cost is above 20 liang. Because sales have not yet started here, a deal has not yet been made. However, the source of the Zhang Code is infiltrated by the Red Army, and there is concern that subsequent batches may be interrupted.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Head Cloths and Piece Goods is Dull</h3>
<p>The piece goods market has been particularly dull in recent days. Local customers have shown no excitement. The reasons for this are: first, the end of May is approaching, and funds are tight, so people are hesitant to purchase more; second, Eastern goods are very active, and their quoted prices are lower than domestic goods, so that most of the sales channels of the shops on this street have been seized by them; and third, it is the off-season, coupled with the fact that the Yangtze River area has not yet recovered from the floods and is also affected by the rampant Communist bandits, which makes it difficult to make progress. Yesterday, the prices of domestic cotton cloth still fell more than they rose. Thirteen-pound cloth remained stable at 5 liang and 4 qian. Eleven-pound cloth fell to 4 liang and 7 qian. Nine-pound cloth remained at 4 liang, 2 or 3 qian. Although there were more purchases of coarse canvas for horse feeding and military uniforms, the more they were sold, the cheaper they became, falling from 7 liang and 5 fen to 6 liang and 8.5 qian. Local customers were more active in fine cloth, but were constrained by Japanese factory goods, and prices fell step by step. Twelve-pound cloth is on the verge of falling to 7 liang. However, the price decline of 13-pound Hubei goods has slowed down recently due to purchases from Yantai, Qingdao, and other gangs. Yesterday, Wannianging was sold for 8 liang and 5 qian, Saima for 8 liang and 3 qian. Western goods were mostly sold in small quantities. Striped poplin moved slightly more than before, with those priced around 3 qian being the most popular. White striped linen and ramie cloth are still being purchased by Ningbo and other ports on this street, and prices are neither high nor low.</p>
<h3>Yellow Twill Continues to Be Released</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wool and woolen goods market showed a trend of weakness. There was no vitality in the market. Spring sales have ended, and the demand from buyers has decreased. Only raincoat cloth and summer goods continue to be released. Yesterday, more than 20 pieces of yellow twill were sold, purchased by military uniform gangs and Western-style tailors. The prices were: Aipu brand, 5 qian and 1 fen; Taihe Three Lions, 5 qian and 5 fen; Shuang Fugui, 4 qian and 9 fen; President, 5 qian and 3.5 fen; Tianxiang, 4 qian and 6.5 fen; Yongle, 4 qian and 7.5 fen; Gongping Shuangmei Dianpao, 4 qian and 8 fen; and miscellaneous brands of lower grade goods were sold by the shops at a retail price of 6 jiao and 3 or 4 fen per yard.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Sales are Brisk and the Market is Firm</h3>
<p>The recent trend of tinplate is very good. Customers and factories are taking in goods, and hoarders are also taking in more goods due to low costs, so the market is trending well. It is estimated that 90-pound British goods are priced at 10 liang and 2.5 qian per box, 100-pound goods at 11 liang and 7.5 qian, 90-pound American goods at 13 liang, 100-pound goods at 14 liang and 7.5 qian, 180-pound British goods at 22 liang, Company Iron at 23 liang, and 200-pound genuine American goods at 29 liang and 7.5 qian. It is estimated that there were a total of 700 to 800 boxes sold in the market yesterday, and both buyers and local customers were very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Coal, White Coal Sales are Weak and the Market is Flat</h3>
<p>Recently, the trading of various types of white coal has been exceptionally quiet. The daily transaction volume of Hongqi Shanxi Cheng goods is no more than 200 to 300 tons. However, the sales of coal for stoves such as Mark Haifeng are still good, and the quoted prices are also flat. Yesterday, Hongqi white coal was sold for 21 liang per ton, Shanxi white coal for 19 liang and 7.5 qian, Haifeng white coal for 21 liang, Mark white coal for 21 liang and 5 qian, special Changdeng white coal for 17 liang, and Liujiang white coal for 16 liang.</p>

<h3>A Discussion of the Recent Situation in Geneva (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Outside the scope of the League of Nations, the public opinions of European and American countries have given us strong help, such as Soviet Russia and the Near Eastern countries of Turkey and Egypt. The United States is even more sympathetic. Even the South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, these ABC countries, although they cannot compare with the powerful countries, their influence in South America is indeed not small. In terms of the public opinion of the 62 countries, both members and non-members of the League of Nations, it can be known that more than 50 countries in the world have expressed goodwill towards us. Therefore, in this Sino-Japanese dispute, our country has won the honor of absolute moral victory in the international community. However, honor is ultimately very empty. What we are asking for is practical gain. If the League of Nations ultimately cannot take effective sanctions against Japan and force it to return our land and compensate us for our losses, then why should our country harbor excessive dreams? In the past, the League of Nations could only say a few fair words. Whether it can invoke Article 16 of the Covenant to make Japan submit is still considered a question by the people in the League of Nations! Recently, Geneva has been crowded with officials and dignitaries, and diplomats from various countries are very active. There are currently four major conferences being held: (1) The League of Nations Administrative Assembly, which meets three times a year, with May being the regular session. The Sino-Japanese issue is of course listed as an important agenda item. (2) The League of Nations Committee of Nineteen, a specially established council specifically for studying the Sino-Japanese issue. (3) The Disarmament Conference. Due to the sudden outbreak of the Far East issue, countries are on guard regarding disarmament. It can be seen that the Sino-Japanese war has had a great impact. (4) The Opium Suppression Conference. Since the establishment of the puppet state after the occupation of the Northeast, it is said that there is a motion to monopolize opium, which has aroused enthusiastic attention from this conference. These four international conferences are all related to the Sino-Japanese incident, which shows the seriousness of the Far East issue. Our country is also concentrating its diplomatic efforts in Geneva. Mr. Yan Huiqing, Liu Wendao, Huang Musong, and Hu Shize are attending the above-mentioned four major conferences separately, negotiating and working hard. In fact, the ability of our country's representatives to operate in Geneva may even be better than that of Japan. However, diplomacy depends entirely on national strength. Without a strong government, a strong nation, and a strong army, navy, and air force as backing, no matter how diplomatic you are, it is in vain! Secondly, the diplomacy of a country must determine its diplomatic policy. For example, in interpersonal relationships, there is the so-called (moral friendship) or (friendship in adversity). Why should countries be an exception? Our country's diplomacy has never had a consistent policy, and sometimes it cannot avoid falling into an isolated situation. I hope that from now on, we can break through the difficulties of the national crisis, and then revitalize politics and strengthen national strength, so that we can win in diplomacy.</p>
<h3>Filial Son Guo</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wanlong</p>
<p>There was a man named Guo in Liuhe. His family belonged to the farming class. Plowing in spring and harvesting in autumn, the whole family relied on it for support. He had an old mother who was blind and sick, and she was bedridden all year round. Guo took care of her very carefully. Whenever there was something delicious, he would always offer it to her, not daring to keep it for himself. The villagers all praised him. Soon, the Japanese army invaded and attacked. Guo's residence happened to be in the line of fire. His wife said to him, "The enemy is deep. Why don't we take shelter?" Guo said, "My mother is old and blind, and walking is difficult. Taking her to flee would hasten her death. If I abandon her and seek survival for myself, would there be any reason in the world? Even if I am foolish, I would not do this." His wife said, "Then shall we sit and wait for death?" Guo said, "I will live with my mother, and die with my mother. I only seek peace of mind. What is there to fear about life and death?" Before long, the war broke out, and the artillery fire was very fierce. Bullets fell like rain. All the villagers took shelter, but Guo alone served his mother and lived happily. One night, a giant shell hit their house, burning the walls and collapsing the walls. The whole family died as martyrs. My relative, Mr. Ye, was Guo's neighbor. That night, he lingered in the village because of something. He witnessed their whole family's death. The death was extremely tragic. He survived the disaster and fled to Hangzhou, where he described the outline of the events to me. Therefore, I write it out to serve as a warning to those who have the heart of beasts. May they be alarmed when they read it. (Thank you for the reward)</p>
<h3>The Disorganized Front Gate Fellow</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>｜Miscellaneous Writings of the Old Capital, Part 2｜ Stepping out of the noisy and chaotic East Railway Station, filled with shouts and the smell of smoke, the first thing that caught my eye was the towering, massive, seemingly miraculous, yet familiar Front Gate tower. Then I saw the heads of people wriggling under the towering building, and the slowly moving streetcars. The streetlights shone brightly and humorously on the ground, and a tin hat was blown back and forth by the cold wind. At this time, the snow was falling even harder, and the toiling people covered their heads with a piece of cloth, without any fixed rules or direction, just like small insects on the water's surface weaving together. Only in the dark corner next to the station stood a large, black pile of rickshaw pullers. Under the threat of cold wind and snowflakes, they held bean-sized oil lamps and moved their wet, heavy footsteps, waiting for customers to hire them for labor. This towering, massive Front Gate tower is just like the one I saw in the picture, except that there are now a few more snowflakes, and a few fewer camels pacing slowly like poets in front of the tower.</p>
<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Museum of Evil Scotland Yard in London, England, has a famous Black Museum. The Black Museum displays all the items used by criminals to commit crimes. Various shapes. Shocking. Recently, Rome, Italy, also opened a new Museum of Evil. MuseumofCrim 件The quality is the same. Among the items displayed in it, there are many interesting things. A short sword. The handle is engraved with the words "Corsica Vendefta" (Corsican Kin Vengeance). And there is a more terrifying sentence on the blade. (May the wounds I cause be fatal.) In addition, there is a special department. It displays the items used by criminals to escape from prison. There are nails, iron keys, etc. There is also a pen tip. It was carefully modified by criminals to look like a knife. Even smarter. It is a fake pistol. Made entirely of bread. And painted black. It turned out that a criminal used it to intimidate the prison guard and was escaped. This museum is also like the Black Museum in London. It can only be used as a reference for experts. Not public</p>
<h3>Weapon Person</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>The weapon person is a more advanced and latest invention of the robot. The shortcomings of the original robot are in creating what kind of actions and what kind of languages. It can only do these rigid actions and languages. It can never do the actions and languages of natural people. In short, its actions and languages are passive, not automatic. The weapon person is very different. The appearance and form are the same as the robot. The content is automatic and passive. The passive and automatic are inseparable and separable. Its magicalness cannot be described by my clumsy pen. Helplessly. Only use ventriloquism and hypnotism as a metaphor. Ventriloquism. One person makes a gesture. Pointing and gesticulating. Raising eyebrows and winking. Suddenly happy and angry. Or singing or crying. The posture is varied. Words and deeds are consistent. Looking closely. Only then did he know that the sound came from another person behind the scenes. The key is the reed. The trick is double. The weapon person is similar. The hypnotist uses the meaning of the hypnotist as the meaning of the hypnotized person. So the hypnotized person's language and actions are at the mercy of the hypnotist. At this moment. The inherent spiritual power of the hypnotized person. If it disappears. The power of the technique. The weapon person is also similar. Combining these two similarities. Sometimes combined into one. It is either ventriloquism or hypnotism. The weapon person is so clever. Sigh and stop. The manufacturer of the weapon person is the same family as Ren Renhao Genfeng, who was given the posthumous title of Wenzheng, who was the prime minister during the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty. Its production motivation. About the year when our country sent Wu Tingfang Yan Fu and other Western students. And after I created the Fujian Shipping Administration Bureau and the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. By 1882. That is, the year of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. The model is slightly complete. Not yet refined. Since this year, secret processing has been advancing rapidly. The people of our country also provided many materials. Until the September 18th Incident last year, the production was completed. This year, 39, the largest one has been built. It is displayed in the shipyard on the left bank of the Songhua River. Let's go and visit it. Recently, Gu Weijun went out of the customs. The weapon person he saw. I'm afraid there are more than just this largest one. When Mr. Gu returns to Japan. Can ask about it.</p>
<h3>The Sigh of China's Aviation Industry</h3>
<p>— Shi Mingzhi</p>
<p>The development of the world's aviation industry. France and Germany were the earliest. But so far, it has only been more than 20 years. And at the beginning, it was only limited to military use. In the early days of the European War. Zeppelin airship. Extremely active. French small aircraft. Also quite powerful. So countries competed to manufacture. After the end of the war. The military aircraft and airships of the great powers. Most of them are more than a thousand. Since the military is oversupplied. Then move part of it for commercial transportation. Since then, the aviation industry. So it is common to the people.</p>

<h3>Yang Qi (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Earlier, Peifu's army was defeated and retreated to Wuchang. Wuchang Wutai Gate was built by Zhang Zhidong, the governor of Huguang at the end of the Qing Dynasty, with a capital of one million. Therefore, the seven counties of Xianning were spared from flooding. In the autumn of the Bingyin year, the water was two feet higher than the shore. Pedestrians were ankle-deep. A certain army occupied Hongshan, overlooking and attacking the city. Peifu crossed the river to Xiakou. In the evening, he talked with Qi in the room. His general Qian entered, saw Qi, and wanted to say something but stopped. He asked for paper and wrote a few lines to show Peifu. Peifu said, "This is not what I want to do." Qi said quickly, "Shall we breach the river to flood the enemy?" Peifu said, "Yes. How did you know?" Qi said, "Zi Wu had planned this with me. I repeatedly thought it was impossible." At this time, Qian looked at Qi and said, "Fortunately, keep it secret. Don't tell anyone else." Qian retired. Qi then said to Peifu in a serious tone, "If this gate is breached, the seven counties of Xianning will be submerged. There are nearly ten million people in the seven counties. There are only four thousand enemy soldiers. Is it not right to sacrifice the people of the seven counties for the sake of four thousand enemies? Moreover, the enemy is perched high on Hongshan, and the horizontal line is twenty or thirty feet above Wuchang City. Breaching the water will only be level with the river. I am afraid that the enemy will not be killed, but the residents will die. Both sides raise banners and troops, saying they are saving the people. I am not saving the people, but killing them. What is the reason?" Peifu was moved and stopped the plan. Qian's plan failed. Qian resented Qi very much. Later, Qian died in the Xiangfan rebel army. Qi is still healthy, eats well, and writes poetry. The way of heaven is believable and unbelievable, unbelievable and believable. Qi served Peifu and endured many hardships. As for Peifu's defeat, rise again, and defeat again, Qi left and went elsewhere. After three years of living with someone who was not the right person, he did not hold any position or make any suggestions. He took his beloved concubine, Di Meinan, and returned to the south. He settled in a garden and no longer had any desire to ask about the world. Qi's talent and knowledge are beyond the reach of ordinary people. He is not just good at poetry. His poetry is rich in the style of the Tang Dynasty. He has written a collection called "Jiangshan Wanli Lou." Our country's aviation industry began in the second year of the Republic of China. In the beginning, it was only used for military purposes. Yuan Shikai founded the Nanyuan Aviation School, with Qin Guoyong as the principal. At the beginning, the school had six aircraft, all purchased from Germany. The coaches were also all Germans. In the third year of the Republic of China, when suppressing the White Wolf, Qin and a certain coach each drove one aircraft to fly to Guangshan, Henan Province for reconnaissance. However, due to poor driving skills at that time, it was of little value in the military. The social elite also paid little attention to it. However, Qin's presence in China cannot but be regarded as a pioneer in the aviation industry. After the fifth year of the Republic of China, the aviation school once expanded to twelve aircraft. They were all purchased from abroad. Due to poor repairs, three or four aircraft were damaged after a while. When Zhang Zuolin extended his power to Beijing, he knew to value aviation very much. However, he only recognized the Northeast as his base, so he did not plan to expand the Nanyuan Aviation School. Instead, he took eight good aircraft from the school and transported them to the Northeast as the foundation of the air force. He also purchased a large quantity from the United States and Japan, and hired foreign instructors for active training. As a result, the Northeast Air Force was able to stand out in the country due to its quality and quantity. However, due to the dereliction of duty by the guards, the September 18th Incident ended up supporting the thieves and fueling the flames. The Nanyuan Aviation School, which had been destroyed many times, had long become a historical term. As for our country's civil aviation industry, it started with the Shanghai-Chengdu aviation service founded by the Ministry of Transportation in the seventeenth year. This is a recent event.</p>

<p>— The Owner of Seeking Happiness Zhai</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Going to a Grand Family Often Makes the General Fall Down; Being Imprisoned in a Prison of Love Can Make a Husband and Wife Be Caged. Ye Zuozhang hurriedly waved his hand and said, "Okay. I think you can talk. I should follow you. But he must be truly talented. Let's take him another day. Wait for me to ask him. As long as it's that kind of thing. I'll send him a commander or brigade commander. I won't be ambiguous. But there's another thing. Old Ba, you have to see my love. In the future, you and your partner will move to my provincial capital to live. You have to come to my office often to talk to me. Don't put on airs and ignore people anymore." Liang Xiaoyun replied with a smile, "I will naturally know what is good and bad. I will often come to greet you." Ye Zuozhang also learned to pout and said, "What kind of greeting? Just as long as you are no longer so imposing and cold to me, I will be very satisfied." After saying that, he shook his head and danced with joy. The fifth wife spat and said, "You are just so inhuman. If you don't say anything, I advise you to be more disciplined. Will it work or not?" Sure enough, Ye Zuozhang was scolded by the fifth wife, and then he became much more honest. He only picked some ordinary things to chat with them. Seeing that it had been more than an hour. He suddenly looked at the watch on his wrist and shouted strangely, "Oh no. It's almost seven o'clock. There's a banquet at Commander Peng's house. There's also a foreign ghost. I have to go earlier. Old Ba. I won't accompany you anymore. You must ask me another day." Liang Xiaoyun conveniently took out a resume card and handed it over, saying, "The person I married is called An Yutian. This is his resume. I promise to bring him to see you in half a day." When she said this, her apricot face was slightly flushed, revealing a bit of coy shyness. Ye Zuozhang took the card and stuffed it into his pocket without even looking at it. But he widened his eyes, staring at Liang Xiaoyun's spring shoot-like slender jade fingers. It seemed that he wanted to use the magic of perspective to peep along a straight line from her white wrist all the way to the various curves and beauty of the sleeves. And when Liang Xiaoyun realized it. She hurriedly pulled her wrist back and shrunk it behind the fifth wife. Ye Zuozhang suddenly sighed a long grievance. He stretched his feet to the edge of the bed to find his shoes. But he couldn't find them in a hurry. Fortunately, De Shun was peeking through the crack in the door curtain outside. He rushed in and found the shoes in the distance. He also squatted down to put them on for him. Only then could he get out of bed and start walking. He walked to the door. He turned his head back to Liang Xiaoyun and waved his hand. He used a new foreign trick of using his fingertips and corners of his mouth to deliver a kiss. He repeated a few laughs with his teeth bared. Seeing that Liang Xiaoyun was still pretending not to see him. Only the fifth wife was sneering at him. He couldn't help shaking his head. He turned his body around and strode away with a majestic and arrogant air.</p>

<p>Speech</p>
<h3>Officialese, Part 4</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has resolved to establish chief county magistrates in fifteen counties including Shanghai, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Songjiang, and Taicang. There will be changes to the current county magistrates, and talent will be the standard. If interpreted according to the text of this passage, the previous fifteen county magistrates were not selected based on talent at all, which has already been publicly admitted. What is puzzling is that Jiangsu Province, with its sixty-one counties, originally had first-class, second-class, and third-class counties. Why is there now a new category of chief county magistrate? This is very strange. However, the scope of authority of the so-called chief county magistrate is unknown compared to that of the former first-class county magistrates. If the scope of authority is also the same as that of the first-class county magistrates, and only the name of chief county magistrate is changed, this is called (changing the soup but not the medicine,) why go to the trouble? Furthermore, the issue of talent cannot be identified solely through examinations, introductions, relatives, etc. It is necessary to test their performance before seeing whether they are talented or not. If so, is it possible that none of the fifteen counties has achieved satisfactory results in governance? It is unknown what kind of people the newly appointed fifteen county magistrates are, whether they will have amazing achievements that can be shown, which is also doubtful. Or it is said that the reason why the provincial government established the chief county magistrates is not like this, or there is another motive. However, the recent provincial government is unwilling to do practical work and instead focuses on making a fuss over superficial details, which is one example. This is officialese, part 4.</p>

<h3>Expressing Resentment</h3>

<p>Who bears the responsibility for the border,</p>
<p>Opens the door to invite the thieves?</p>
<p>The rivers and mountains are stained with blood,</p>
<p>The golden walls have turned to ashes.</p>
<p>White bones vie for food with dogs,</p>
<p>Green forests echo with the cries of ghosts.</p>
<p>The sad wind rustles,</p>
<p>The setting sun shines on the city wall.</p>
<p>Hearing that the enemy has come to the homeland,</p>
<p>The slaughter has emptied the city.</p>
<p>On the day of the nation's survival,</p>
<p>In the midst of the mountains and rivers, I am filled with emotion.</p>
<p>In this life, I have encountered great chaos,</p>
<p>And I intend to join the army.</p>
<p>Where will this great catastrophe end?</p>
<p>I raise my head and ask the heavens.</p>
<p>Beacon fires rise continuously,</p>
<p>The enemy's atmosphere has not yet been cleared.</p>
<p>Luoyang sings and dances merrily,</p>
<p>Shanghai is filled with war-like sorrow.</p>
<p>Ants climb the chariot and weep,</p>
<p>Turtles go ashore and roam.</p>
<p>The southeast is lightly abandoned,</p>
<p>I weep and cry for the divine land.</p>
<p>The cream and blood have been extorted,</p>
<p>The common people cannot bear it.</p>
<p>Pretending to be mighty, they drive fierce tigers,</p>
<p>Plundering food to feed hungry eagles.</p>
<p>In broad daylight, they dance like demons,</p>
<p>In red mansions, they hate ghosts at night.</p>
<p>Towering old mansions,</p>
<p>Withered and fallen, like dead vines.</p>

<h3>Several Small Handicrafts</h3>
<p>— Guan Han</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the most significant tragedy has been the impact on countless refugees suffering unemployment. Besides employing the unemployed as much as possible, we should also impart knowledge of small-scale crafts to enable them to have skills to support themselves. Having seen this, I am presenting three or two minor crafts that I have researched and successfully developed, hoping to fulfill my responsibility.</p>
<p>(1) Flypaper</p>
<p>Ingredients: 4 ounces of rosin, 1 ounce of honey, 1 ounce of raw sesame oil.</p>
<p>Instructions: Put the above ingredients into a pot, heat to melt, and stir slowly with a stick to mix evenly. Then, spread it on thick hemp paper that has been soaked in glue.</p>
<p>(2) Mosquito Repellent</p>
<p>(A) Ingredients: 80% camphor alcohol (available at pharmacies), 20% denatured alcohol.</p>
<p>Instructions: Mix them evenly in a bottle, seal, and store to prevent leakage. If having an outdoor evening banquet, apply it all over your face, hands, and feet to avoid mosquito attention. Or, put a few drops on your pillow for a peaceful sleep without worry.</p>
<p>(B) Ingredients: Equal parts lemon juice, a little wine, and Zhenjiang vinegar.</p>
<p>Instructions: Mix them evenly in a bottle as before. Spray around the bedroom or damp areas to repel mosquitoes.</p>
<p>(3) High-Quality Tooth Powder</p>
<p>Ingredients: 9 ounces of light lead carbonate (WhitePowderedChalk9ozs), 1 ounce of white sugar (WhiteSugerIoz), 1.5 ounces of high-quality olive oil soap powder (PowderedCortileSoapI2\Iozs), 1 ounce of white angelica powder (OrrisRootIoz).</p>
<p>Instructions: After preparing the above ingredients, mix them thoroughly in a bowl.

<h3>Random Thoughts on Reading</h3>
<p>— Bei Lei</p>
<p>(Those who aspire to read lack money, and those who have money to read lack aspiration) is a common ailment of modern youth. We can cry for the former and mourn for the latter.</p>
<p>(Readers dislike exercise, and those who like exercise often don't read) is also one of the defects of modern education. Those who excel in intelligence are poor in physical strength, and those who excel in physical strength are weak in intelligence. Neither can accomplish great things.</p>
<p>(Viewing education as a source of profit and students as fat sheep) is why Chinese education has not been able to develop to this day.</p>
<p>The ancients said (reading to clarify aspirations) and also (reading to understand principles). Hu Shi said (reading for the sake of reading). These are all answers to why one should read. But now there are new interpretations, namely (reading to show off), (reading to pursue the opposite sex), (reading to practice being future politicians and dignitaries), and (reading for romance).</p>
<p>If you give a student a scientific book and ten books on politics and economics, they will always quickly grab the books on politics and economics and run. A volume of Oscar Wilde's English literature is not as popular as one (History of Sexuality).</p>
<p>The more one reads, the less one dares to speak, but what one can say is not refuted. Those who speak a lot and often have limited knowledge.</p>
<h3>Drops of Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>During the yellow season, I was alone, left behind in front of the gray-white window. The loneliness of wanting to die tightly wrapped me, allowing my mood to remain tranquil, so I was very indulgent towards my own thoughts.</p>
<p>The wealthy family across the street paid a very high price for these beautiful roses, but they couldn't thrive due to the master's kindness. This must have disappointed the rich man too much, right?</p>
<p>However, roses can always be repurchased, even though their thorns sometimes prick your skin.</p>
<p>As long as you have money, you can become an official. Similarly, as long as you are an official, you will make money. Originally, these are two-in-one, one-in-two things.</p>
<p>Some say that the command knife can command scholars, but most of the so-called scholars are happy to be commanded by the command knife.</p>
<p>That's how they depend on each other for survival.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that (a certain military leader) is going to personally take the field again... But this (command knife) does not announce his full name in advance, but only prefixes it with the word (a certain). Why? I think this is probably because once, twice, three times..., afraid of being asked (Aren't you ashamed?)</p>
<p>Before the white cat left, the mice started fighting again. If they can't decide the winner, they can ask the tabby cat for help.</p>
<p>This is brothers fighting within the walls, defending against external (insults).</p>
<p>The old bully next door was secretly attacked by hooligans. The weak were overjoyed and laughed loudly, but were immediately seen by the bully's godson, who gave the laugher a full slap. I think this was really a satisfying hit; (...Why did you laugh at his stepfather's death in his face? What an idiot!)</p>

<p>Suddenly the electric light came on, and the room was filled with white light. My mood was subdued by it and did not dare to tremble.</p>

<h3>Seeking an Accountant</h3>
<p>On the second floor of a large building on Yuanmingyuan Road, a sign from ×× Company was posted on the spring door of the office. I carefully pushed the door open and went in.</p>
<p>("Is this the place that advertised in the newspaper yesterday for an accountant, a debt collector, and several social secretaries?") I cautiously asked a gentleman, about thirty years old, sitting at the writing desk, with a respectful attitude.</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>
<p>"We are already fully staffed, but there is still a vacancy in the accounting department, with a monthly salary of thirty yuan. Room and board are not provided. In addition to the shop guarantee, a cash guarantee of two hundred yuan is also required," he continued.</p>
<p>At that time, I asked him, since there is a reliable shop guarantee, why is a cash guarantee of two hundred yuan still needed? He said without hesitation, ("Because with a shop guarantee, although there is a possibility of guarantee, if there is a debt of tens or hundreds of yuan to the company, or if a small incident occurs, then it is certainly possible to seek compensation from the guarantor according to the law, but for this small amount of money, hiring a lawyer and paying litigation fees may not be worth the loss. Therefore, after the decision of our company's manager, from now on, in addition to the shop guarantee, new employees must have a considerable cash guarantee.") After hearing his words, I felt that it was fully justified. Just as we were about to continue talking, two young women ran in from outside the door. Sure enough, their mission was also for this matter. He routinely told them about the various treatments and conditions. Later, they asked if the cash guarantee could be reduced. He solemnly stated that there could be no concession, and said that this was the company's regulations. Needless to say, it was all for this matter. Because of time constraints, I wrote down a mailing address and agreed to hear back on Sunday morning. As I left the office, I thought to myself that when I walked in, he didn't say that there was only one vacancy, but later one person came in after another, and he didn't mention that sentence. This is the first suspicious point. Since he advertised in the newspaper for an accountant, he undoubtedly wanted to find suitable talent. He should have given considerable consideration to the employees he hired, whether they could be competent for their responsibilities. But he never paid attention to this point. As long as you have a cash guarantee of two hundred yuan and the ability to get a shop guarantee, you can be hired. This is the second suspicious point.</p>
<p>On Sunday, because I had other things to do, I couldn't go, and later I put this matter aside. About three weeks later, I saw a similar recruitment advertisement in the newspaper's employment section, but his address was at ×× Company on Fuxi Road. The next day, I happened to pass by that location, so I conveniently ran in to inquire. Unexpectedly, as soon as I entered the door, I saw the gentleman who had talked to me on Yuanmingyuan Road before. At the same time, there were several young people who had entered before me. His conversation was exactly the same as what he had said last time. At that time, I became even more suspicious. Last time he said that there was only one vacancy, but there were more than ten times the number of people who went to negotiate that day, and why did he publish such a large recruitment advertisement again? Moreover, recruiting employees is an open and aboveboard matter, so why was the address first on Yuanmingyuan Road and then on Fuxi Road? The background behind it is self-evident.</p>

<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>A Maid's Confession (2)</h3>
<p>— Le Shan</p>
<p>The young girl, about ten years old, of the great-aunt always went out with the madam and young madam every night. Influenced by what she saw and heard, she learned to play roulette. When she came back, she would imitate it, forcibly asking me and ×× to take out our money and play with her. She didn't want copper coins, she had to have silver dollars. Sometimes, she would snatch three or five silver dollars from us and firmly refuse to return them. If we didn't ask her for it, how much would we earn in a month for our hard work? If we asked her for it, she would carelessly poke and throw sharp objects like scissors. We had no choice but to swallow our anger and not dare to confront her fierce edge.</p>
<p>They would rather lose hundreds of silver dollars on roulette than be willing to buy an electric fan. Whenever the fat madam, who was afraid of the heat, reached summer, she would order us to stand behind her and fan her, whether she was eating or playing cards. We kept fanning her continuously, and even though our hands were sore and tired, she would still angrily complain and blame heaven and earth, even rewarding us with a couple of slaps.</p>
<p>The madam wanted to be fanned while eating, and the young master and the great-aunt's little girl also made a fuss about wanting to be fanned. Our two fleshy hands became a strange electric fan that didn't feel tired. We were so busy that we were sweating like rain and had nowhere to go.</p>
<p>In the eyes of ordinary people, maids seem to be lowly and greedy, disregarding shame. Therefore, when the master lost silver coins or valuable things such as jewelry, they suspected that the maids stole them. Our master, who lacked moral instruction and had no ability to judge people, usually guarded against us as strictly as against thieves.</p>
<p>One day, unfortunately, one of the great-aunt's gold rings and one of her bracelets disappeared. The master and madam said in stern voices that we stole them and ordered us to confess. We were so angry that we couldn't open our mouths. They tied us up and beat us, and then conducted a thorough search of our whole bodies and bedding, clothes, and bags, but still couldn't find the stolen goods. They beat us again and insisted that we had taken them out to pawn, forcing us to produce the pawn tickets. At that time, both ×× and I would rather be beaten to death than falsely admit to being thieves.</p>
<p>Although the madam compensated the great-aunt, she felt very pained at the thought of spending two or three hundred yuan, so she vented her anger on us. I was in so much pain that I wanted to commit suicide several times, but I was afraid that dying would only sink me deeper into injustice. Alas! It was so painful to live, and impossible to die, it was truly unbearable!</p>
<p>Heaven has eyes. Later, the young master suddenly contracted syphilis, which became more and more severe every day. He couldn't hide it from the master and madam. After questioning him, they finally realized that it was the dignified young master who stole the gold ring and gold bracelet, not us lowly maids. Only then did their suspicions break and our grievances were cleared.</p>
<p>When Mrs. C heard this, she couldn't help but say ("Amitabha"), causing us to burst into laughter, which interrupted the maid's words. I then got up to say goodbye.</p>

<h3>Humble Later, Arrogant Before</h3>
<p>— Nuo Xia</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman said very sincerely to her husband, Mr. Wang:</p>
<p>("Honey, you still have nothing to do today, why don't you come to the company with me to buy something?")</p>
<p>Mr. Wang just sat on the sofa smoking and reading the newspaper, pretending not to hear. It was only after the third question that he put on a smiling face and replied,</p>
<p>("It would be embarrassing for my friends to see me, you should go by yourself.")</p>
<p>She had nothing to say, so she left alone in frustration.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang said very sincerely to his lover:</p>
<p>("Are you going to the company to buy something today? Let me go with you.")</p>
<p>His lover just put on makeup in front of the mirror, pretending not to hear. It was only after the third question that she put on a smiling face and replied:</p>
<p>("It would be embarrassing for my sisters to see me, you should just wait at home.")</p>
<p>He had nothing to say. He watched his lover leave, then lay down on the rocking chair and dozed off, waiting for her to return.</p>

<h3>Investment of 10 Million Dollars for</h3>
<h3>The 1932 New Car Competition</h3>
<p>▲Ford's Grand Plan In the American automobile industry, one recent event has attracted considerable attention. That is, Ford Motor Company's efforts to manufacture new Ford automobiles. According to Ford, the new cars it produces will be shipped to 200 major cities across the United States for public display. Ford's move not only adds a unique color to the American automobile industry but also benefits a large number of unemployed workers. Henry and Edsel Ford's new initiative boldly challenges (the depression) and provides a concrete solution to the unemployment problem. Ford's new eastern plant is located in Edgewater, New Jersey. Although the company is reluctant to disclose the number of employees, it is reliable to say that former workers will be given priority. Currently, Ford employs approximately 70,000 workers, which is estimated to increase to 100,000, and can accommodate up to 120,000 workers at its peak.</p>
<p>Ford's manufacturing of new automobiles requires a considerable amount of working capital, easily amounting to millions of dollars. According to Associated Press news, the expenses include the following: (1) Raw materials, transportation, and labor in Detroit: $300,000,000. (2) Expenses for railway and shipping companies: $86,000,000. (3) Monthly procurement of new raw materials: $52,000,000. (4) Expenses for decoration and fabrics: $48,000,000. (5) Steel materials purchased from the market: $47,000,000. (6) Tires: $20,000,000. (7) Monthly wages for 10,000 workers: $18,000,000. (8) Steel materials manufactured by the plant: $16,000,000. (9) Glass expenses: $10,000,000. (10) Additional machinery: $6,375,000. (11) Malleable cast iron: $5,044,000. (12) Paint: $4,854,000. (13) Raw rubber: $4,800,000. (14) Pig iron: $4,680,000. (15) Hardwood: $4,000,000. (16) Copper: $3,500,000. (17) Lead: $1,500,000. Based on the above quantities, the transportation will require 236,000 inbound vehicles and 228,000 outbound vehicles, which will provide railway personnel with more work and prevent them from being idle.</p>
<p>When announcing the launch of the new car, Edsel Ford, General Manager of Ford Motor Company, stated that his father and he firmly believe that domestic commerce can have some recovery at this time. Ford also said, "We are very clear about the future of the new car. The car we want to build should have eight cylinders and extremely high horsepower, but its structure should be very simple. Its characteristics should be its speed and power, and its selling price should be in line with the public's ability to purchase. I can definitely say that all the costs of building this car are not taken into account, because the more carefully the cost is calculated, the higher the selling price will be. Therefore, the time and effort spent on building the car are not taken into account. We are very aware of our responsibilities and are trying our best to find ways to restore workers to their jobs. This project has already started. Next Thursday, the people of the country can judge our work. In addition to the eight-cylinder and 65-horsepower car, we are also building a four-cylinder and 50-horsepower car. These two types of cars have 14 different styles, but except for the engine, the two cars are generally the same. The car body and frame are absolutely the same, but the selling prices of the two cars are different. The V8 will be listed among the low-priced cars, while the (4) will be even cheaper. This is our aim to serve the driving public, especially in the current economic situation."</p>
<p>American automobile companies have invested heavily in planning their 1932 automobile businesses. The amount of investment has exceeded $1,000,000,000, and many companies have already launched new cars. The progress planned is beyond what has been imagined in recent years. This kind of progress is believed to promote the improvement of business. However, after learning about Ford's plan in February, people inevitably felt a setback. The impact was particularly severe on low-priced cars. Leaders of other automobile companies hoped that this kind of promotion would only allow people to see what the new Ford was like before buying, and that the buying situation would return to normal when it was presented. If this is true, then the launch of Ford's new car can increase general business.</p>
<p>General Motors Company recently established a sales organization to integrate sales and manufacturing. The companies involved are Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac, which are mid-priced cars. Chrysler's Plymouth car was launched on April 3rd. Studebaker and Graham-Paige both stated that sales were very successful. Therefore, the future of various new cars is very bright.</p>
<p>The new Ford V8 can travel 75 miles per hour, and the four-cylinder can travel 65 miles per hour. As for the characteristics of its engine structure, there are also some that can be introduced, such as silent synchronous shifting, silent gears, engine rubber isolation, downdraft carburetor and carburetor silencer, automatic spark management, diaphragm pump to force fuel out of the rear fuel tank. In addition, there are flexible transverse semi-suspended springs, new-style tail springs, self-adjusting double-acting shock absorbers, large four-wheel brakes, new-style electric steel-spoked wheels with large hubs, hubcaps, and large tires. Rubber is used extensively in the new car. Rubber isolation is used in the frame and the spring hooks and shock-absorbing chain links of the running gear to reduce vibration. Rubber is also used as a pad between the car body and the frame.</p>
<h3>Streamlining of Transportation Equipment</h3>
<p>▲A Great Revolution in the World of Power</p>
<p>Suppose you are driving your current, commonly used car at high speed on the road, traveling at 60 miles per hour. Now, imagine your car suddenly changes: its engine moves to the rear, the flat radiator becomes rounded, and the headlights and bumpers are shrunk and integrated into the smooth, rounded front. The square rear of the car is elongated, trailing into a long, pointed tail.</p>
<p>Now, look at your speedometer. Even though you haven’t pushed the accelerator even a millimeter more, your car's speed has increased from 60 to 75 miles per hour. Simultaneously, while the speed has increased, the gasoline consumption has not increased at all.</p>
<p>This ideal reformation is one of the effects of "streamlining." "Streamline"—readers probably already know—is the route of fluid (like water and air) flow. "Streamlining" means shaping the outline of a moving object in a way that allows fluids to flow smoothly without obstruction, thereby reducing its resistance.</p>
<p>If a car has been properly streamlined, it can travel 35 to 40 miles per gallon of gasoline, at least doubling the mileage compared to using an old-fashioned car. Most current cars have square backs and many protruding parts, all of which obstruct the smooth flow of air, thus subjecting the car to great resistance.</p>
<p>Recently, a type of "teardrop" car has appeared in the United States, attracting general attention and criticism. Everyone thinks that a falling teardrop or raindrop is a perfectly streamlined form. However, Dr. H.L. Dryden, a fluid mechanics expert at the U.S. Bureau of Standards, disagrees. He believes that people tend to overemphasize the teardrop shape and neglect other forms. "In fact," he says, "any shape without edges that cause reverse vortices can be considered streamlined. From a streamlined point of view, the 'teardrop' shape is not necessarily the best." Dr. Dryden also states that partial or superficial streamlining (such as changing square edges to round edges) is ineffective. All automobiles must be remodeled according to principles derived from practical experiments.</p>
<p>The doctor also says that most car drivers do not know that the maximum speed of an ordinary car is limited by air resistance. When the car travels at speeds above 40 or 50 miles per hour, wind resistance becomes the only obstacle. Therefore, reducing this resistance is equivalent to increasing the speed accordingly. The application of streamlining can reduce this resistance by half.</p>
<p>Dr. Dryden further expresses a brilliant insight, stating that while currently so-called streamlined cars can indeed travel twice as far on one gallon of gasoline, their resistance is still ten times greater than that of a completely streamlined car. The attainment of the highest standard awaits the future. At that time, one gallon of gasoline will be able to travel 100 miles or more.</p>
<p>The streamlining of cars involves not only formal modifications but also various fundamental changes, such as moving the engine behind the seats, lowering the seats, reducing the cross-sectional area of the car body, and so on. The result of streamlining will make driving more comfortable and economical because the structure of the car will be simplified. Also, when the car is driving, dust can be prevented from flying behind the car due to the smooth flow of air.</p>
<p>In California, USA, at least six freight trucking routes have already converted their trucks to streamlined forms. As a result, they are able to carry goods up to the legal weight limit with little increase in gasoline consumption. On the roads of Germany, streamlined cars are already common sights. In England, streamlined cars are also gradually becoming visible. Not long ago, Sir Denistoun Burney's airship-like car made its first appearance on British roads. The crowd was amazed by the integrated, beautifully curved machine. Although the car only had 22 horsepower, road tests showed that it could reach a speed of 80 miles per hour. In other countries, the streamlining of cars is receiving similar attention and welcome. (To be continued) News</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Features of the New Dodge Car</h3>
<p>Dodge cars are renowned in the automotive world for their excellent materials. Their manufacturing excellence, vehicle reliability, and beautiful appearance are all praised by society. In a word, everything about Dodge cars is superior to other vehicles, which is generally recognized in the automotive industry. Recently, many new eight-cylinder and six-cylinder Dodge cars have arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, we have studied these new cars one by one, and it is undeniable that the new Dodge cars have their own unique advantages. Tracing back to the source, the Dodge Brothers Motor Company was initially known for manufacturing sturdy, wide-edged small cars. At that time, the sales of these small cars were unprecedented. Since then, new cars have been introduced to the automotive market every year, greatly pleasing car owners. To this day, the value of Dodge cars has become the best in the industry.</p>
<p>Dodge cars are known in the automotive market for their precise construction, as mentioned above. However, the construction of the 1932 model new car is also based on previous examples, with many changes. Moreover, the increase in speed, the improvement in safety, and the beautiful appearance are beyond the reach of previous new cars. In the past, when manufacturing vehicles, the engineering aspects were refined and perfected, sparing no effort. This year's new car has paid even more attention to the internal structure. All the advantages of the past are fully preserved, and the decoration is even more exquisite today. Therefore, the new Dodge car has become the most perfect car today.</p>
<p>The dealer of new Dodge cars is the China Motor Company. People who want to buy a car can go for a test drive day or night. Once the car owner tries it, the advantages of the Dodge car are immediately apparent, such as the automatic engaging clutch, silent gears, and live wheels, which are even more important advantages. As for the richness of power, it is even more unprecedented. Regardless of the six-cylinder or eight-cylinder, it can use an amazing push rod on difficult roads to obtain the fastest speed. In terms of horsepower, it is like a heavenly horse flying in the sky, and it can be active everywhere. When driving in the countryside or on city streets, there is no noise at all. Even using the highest gear, there is no sense of vibration.</p>
<p>The automatic engaging clutch works perfectly with the live wheel system. The live wheel adopts a dual-use type, which is used to handle the engaging clutch. Silent gears are also one of the advantages. When in use, there is no noise under any circumstances. In addition, the hydraulic brake with a temperature indicator is also the latest device. The car body is cast from a single piece of steel, which can increase the car's robustness. Any force cannot damage the car body. The frame is shaped like a bridge, so it can also be used as a racing car on the road. Using the second gear, the speed per hour can also reach 50 miles. In summary, readers can easily understand the advantages of the new Dodge car. Therefore, since the new car was launched, it has become popular all over the world in just a few months.</p>
<h3>New Record of Williams-Avellan</h3>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>A Williams-Avellan six-cylinder sports car broke the record between New York and Los Angeles by traversing an extremely long distance of the continent at the fastest speed. The return trip time was only seven hours apart.</p>
<p>▲The new record was produced by a long distance of 6,770 miles back and forth between New York and Los Angeles. The new record between the two cities was produced in 135 hours and 22 minutes. The average speed was 50.066 miles per hour, which is the new highest average speed. The former was 47.05 miles. The climate of the trip ranged from hot to watery, rainy and foggy, from sea level to over 8,000 feet above sea level. In order to produce the record, it sometimes traveled more than one mile in one minute.</p>
<p>▲Cross-country rush departed from the Western Union Association west of New York at midnight. The two drivers reached Los Angeles 65 hours and 19 minutes after departure. This itinerary has been completed. This new record from one coast to another is not only the glory of Williams-Avellan, but also the great efforts of the two drivers. Before departure, one of the drivers said, "My intention is to choose a low-priced car for this trip." After researching various low-priced cars, he decided to choose a Williams-Avellan six-cylinder sports car because of its strong structure, high horsepower and safety characteristics.</p>
<p>▲Overcoming dangers In the past, the records between the two cities were produced by cars with higher prices than Williams-Avellan, and with the help of highway experts and police to guide the route and so on. However, this time Williams-Avellan did not have any kind of help, so safety through large cities and rural areas was a major issue. The speed was therefore hindered. The first part of the trip was to pass through the Ali Han Mountains with 440 miles in heavy fog. This section of the road was extremely difficult to do, but it was still able to travel 444 in 7 hours and 49 minutes, with an average speed of 58.7 miles per hour. The 415 miles from Washington to Junsef were reached in 474 minutes. The 415 miles from Spring Land to Tepica in Erlenor were also reached in 474 minutes. There were times when the speed of the car was as fast as 70 miles per hour. Secondly, the 985 miles from Tepica to Earl Punk had extremely winding mountain roads and faced the sea breeze blowing from the Pacific Ocean, and passed through the famous Raton Gorge. It was still rare to be able to complete the journey in 18 hours and 31 minutes, with an average speed of 53.7 miles. This section of the itinerary is indeed enough to prove the reliability of the car's engine power, radiator, and oil system, all of which have given us great satisfaction. 65 hours and 19 minutes after leaving New York, we arrived safely in Los Angeles. After arriving, we inspected all the mechanical parts, and their perfect condition remained the same as before. The next afternoon, we set off again and passed through the desert at night. Later, when we reached Mt. Furnace and Mt. Taff, the temperature dropped to freezing point, and the effect of the car's motor remained the same as before. 45 hours after leaving Los Angeles, we arrived in Petersville. We arrived in Washington at 6:43 the next morning. From here, heading towards New York, the speed gradually decreased, because officials were inspecting the machinery from time to time.</p>
<p>▲Back to New York We safely arrived at the Western Union Association in New York at 3:22 pm. We came out to inspect and verified that the time spent was 135 hours and 22 minutes, which is a new record for the round trip from New York to Los Angeles. A driver said, "Our car was officially inspected at the New York Service Department after arriving, and it was guaranteed that the car's motor still maintained excellent condition after traveling 6,770 miles." According to 1932, it is the 25th anniversary of the Williams-Avellan Company. The Knight and Bobbitt cars manufactured by the company are welcomed all over the world. In the past few years, it has produced several speed and economic records. The price of this year's 1932 car is the lowest in the company's history. Yingtam</p>
<h3>British Automotive News Pei</h3>
<p>▲British people like to drive children's cars (children's) cars are small criminal cars. Economical cost and convenient driving. All drive big cars and go up. In recent years, British people's trends have shown a fondness for small cars. Therefore, a kind of small car with 8 to 12 horsepower is popular in London. This kind of small car not only saves a lot of fuel, but also has the benefit of reducing taxes and fees. British middle-class people like to buy it the most. All those who used to buy 13, 16 and 20 horsepower cars have changed to use this kind of small car because of the heavy horsepower tax and the high price of fuel. According to London car dealers, the 20 horsepower big cars will gradually decrease in the future. As for the small cars, they are often sold out after they leave the factory. There is a great trend of demand exceeding supply. The difference in the cost of big cars and small cars can be seen from the proportion. For example, if each car travels 7,000 miles a year and each gallon of gasoline costs 3 shillings and 2 pence, the expenses of various sizes of cars are as follows. 8 horsepower, tax 8 pounds, insurance 12 pounds, gasoline 10 pounds and 8 shillings, a total of 30 pounds and 8 shillings. 9 horsepower, tax 9 pounds, insurance 12 pounds, gasoline 11 pounds and 14 shillings, a total of 32 pounds and 14 shillings. 15 horsepower, tax 15 pounds, insurance 15 pounds, gasoline 23 pounds and 7 shillings, a total of 53 pounds and 7 shillings. 20 horsepower, tax 20 pounds, insurance 20 pounds, gasoline 26 pounds and 10 shillings, a total of 66 pounds and 10 shillings. The above tax, insurance, and gasoline are the three prerequisites for driving a car. The 30 pounds and 10 shillings of the 8 horsepower car is one times different compared with the 66 pounds and 10 shillings of the 20 horsepower car. The difference in cost between big and small cars can be understood from this.</p>
<p>▲More British cars exported According to the statistics of the British Ministry of Commerce in March, the number of car exports increased by £11,674 compared with February. However, if compared with the same period in 1931, it fell by £38,475. In total for three months, it decreased by £300,059. The export of complete cars and parts increased by £67,392. The export of car frames increased by £19,279. The total number of motorcycles and parts in March increased by £117,603 compared with February. March of this year increased by £21,074 compared with the same period last year. However, three months decreased by £184,147. Regarding imports, the number this year is less than last year. Compared with the same period last year in March this year, the import of all cars fell by £27,578. The total number of three months decreased by £73.625. The import value of car frames decreased by £14,691 in March this year compared with March 1931. The total of three months fell by £36,115. The number of imported parts increased by £59,980 in March compared with the same period last year. If the total is calculated in three months, it will be less by £35,213. Comparing imports and exports, British car exports exceeded imports by £217,510 in March. The total oversupply for three months was £956,103.</p>
<p>▲Decrease in the number of American-made cars exported to the UK Although the UK manufactures many cars by itself, the number of cars imported from foreign countries in previous years was also quite large. However, last year, due to the UK's change in tax rates and the tendency of buyers to purchase small cars, the number of foreign cars exported to the UK decreased significantly. Among them, the impact of cars made in the United States was even greater. According to statistics, the number of cars shipped from the United States to the United Kingdom last year was only 3,130 units. In 1930, there were 10,694 units. In 1929, there were 22,729 units. Comparing the two, the difference is far away. The reasons for the decline can be roughly divided into four points. 1. Due to the decline of all industries, the economic power of the society is unstable, and buyers are hesitant to move forward. 2. The British pound depreciated, resulting in a huge hidden loss. 3. The import tax on foreign goods has increased. Cars are taxed based on horsepower. 4. British people tend to wear small cars. With the above four relationships, the import of American cars is decreasing day by day. As for horsepower taxation, it is not very high, but the amount of import tax is huge. British people who buy foreign cars are often unwilling to spend extra money. Therefore, when choosing between them, they unconsciously plan a lot for American cars, and replace them with domestic products.</p>
<p>▲Current status of automobile taxation in the UK In 1920, the UK levied the current system of motorcycle tax. In the past twelve years, it has increased from £7,775,000 to £28,000,000. The latest tax revenue, from December 1, 1931 to February 20, 1932, totaled £16,931,359. The same period last year was £16,993,368. Comparing the two, it decreased by £62,000. This is probably the first time that income has decreased since the automobile tax was levied. The tax revenue in 1930 was £16,552,113, and in 1931 it was £16,993,368. Last year increased by £441,255 compared with the previous year. As for the £62,000 that fell from September last year to February this year, it was not because the number of car registrations was small, which affected the tax revenue. In fact, the number of cars has been growing. However, because most buyers choose small cars, the tax they pay also decreases with it. Miscellaneous notes</p>
