<p>時評</p>
<h3>美俄果有共同對日之準備乎華·</h3>
<p>光隂如白駒過隙。日本以武力製造之满洲僞組織。自其成立以來。忽忽已六閱月矣。當其成立之初。曾於三月十二日。要求列國承認。當時中外目光。雖均注於滬案。然僞組織爲日人之傀儡。舉世共曉。故列國無一承認之者。於是日本亦逡巡。未予承認。惟在日人之意。以爲若承認僞組織。則其今後在我東北破壞條約之一切舉動。皆可詭稱僞組織所爲。與日本無干。而規避其責任。於日本有莫大便利。是以今將不顧一切。悍然進行其承認僞組織之準備矣。　　日本欲承認僞組織。自不能不有所顧慮。國聯之反對日本承認僞組織。調查團。在日本時早有表示。誠以日如承認僞組織。不僅表示蔑視國際公約。抑且違反歷届國聯大會之决議。其影響所及。不止中國一國已也。國聯之反對</p>
<p>日本所不能不顧慮者也。此外美俄兩國。一則深懼日本由侵略北满。進而蠶食西伯利亞與沿海州。一則爲爭太平洋霸權。絕不願容日本獨佔東北之利源。皆反對日本承認僞組織。故對此兩國。日本亦昕夕不安。謀所以應付者也。　　今者。日本進行承認僞組織之準備益亟。而主義絕不相容之俄美兩國。據連日外電所傳。其復交運動。竟已漸入佳境。且又漸見具體化。美國將允許蘇俄在美發行債票。俄國將承認一部分對美之舊債。並允許美國在堪察加半島設立海軍根據地。此議如成事實。或即兩國共同對付日本之準備。此與東亞局勢未來之變化。有深切之關係。吾人良未可忽視。</p>
<p>美俄復交。能否成爲事實。以及何時成爲事實吾人雖未敢懸揣然假使兩國復交能在最近將來實現實於兩國均屬有利。殆可斷言。如（一）美國可以立即解除孤立之困境。（二）美國之投資與貨品。可得一廣大之市場。（三）日本鑒於兩國合作。野心或可稍戢。對於美國必留餘地。此就美國之立場論。於美有利之點也。更就俄國言。有利之點。亦復不少。如資本主義國家反俄聯合戰線。從此不易造成一也。俄日間一旦有事。俄國不致孤立無援。單獨犧牲二也。獲得美國物資之援助。可以促其國内建設事業之進步三也。俄固渴盼復交成爲事實。第不知向來保守之美國。果有促成兩國邦交恢復之勇氣否耶。</p>
<p>美俄兩國。有由接近而進於復交之望。未始非由俄國自强不息之故。俄如内部不安。邊境之軍備不修。遑論美俄復交之呼聲。因主義上根本不同之故。將莫由發生。抑且竊恐日軍或已壓境。而俄國國運將墮入黑暗之深淵。難於自拔。亦未可知。此吾人所不可不注意者也。</p>
<p>反觀吾國對日又如何。收復失地。渺不可期。比較上對日有力量者。僅僅東北義軍之苦鬥而已。然武籐到任。將以收拾我義軍爲其重要之任務。而内田近復大放厥辭。謂「世人多以爲日本如承認满洲國。世界各國必干涉日本。但據外務省所得消息。目前各國因經濟恐慌。無餘力涉及遠東問題。假使某國出而干涉。日本已抱定方針。干涉亦是徒然。」嗚呼。内田作此目空一切之談。各國能承受耶。我不暇深究各國之能承受與否。但願國人痛自深思反省。羣策羣力。共同實施所以自救之有效方策。毋使侵略我者之虚驕。日甚一日耳。</p>

<p>意企圖推翻國聯調查報告</p>
<p>華聯社九日東京電　日外務省昨日電命駐日内瓦日代表部通知國聯秘書處、謂日本將與李頓報告書同時提出關於满案之日本意見書、以便同時審議、本來國聯調查團爲日外交部所要求、經理事會同意而簡派的、至調查後之今日、日本反不尊重李頓報告書、另提出意見書、意在擾亂大會、日本之出爾反爾之外交政策、頗惹起歐美人士之反感、</p>
<p>路透九日東京電　據似屬可靠之消息、李頓調查報告書承認恢復满洲舊日之地位爲不可能、故建議闢爲不設軍備區、而予以自治權、由日本顧問匡助之、中國則在名義上享有該地之主權、報告書並建議日本·中國·「满洲僞國」·應聽令自行開直接談判、而由國聯監視云、日政界評論此項消息、謂日本雖擬於最近之將來承認「满洲僞國」、但日後亦能勸「满洲僞國」與中國談判云、</p>

<h3>石丸少佐批評九一八事變日政府之責任（三）</h3>
<p>節譯日本對世界戰爭</p>
<p>丨自知無理由可以對簿公庭丨</p>
<p>丨故毅然拒絕第三國之裁定丨</p>
<p>夫主張道義之國聯、責難日本之主張與態度、當知其决非侮辱日本、實因日本忽然大開倒車、重演過去時代之尚力主義、不用平和手段、解决紛爭、而徑自訴諸武力、故不得不加以糾正也、吾意偉大國民之在世界、與其大言壯語、主張尚力主義、何如鄙武力而不用、另選和平政策之爲愈、即至萬不獲已、必須出於用兵一途時、亦應使其行動光明正大、不受人疑、方爲得策、言念及此、我覺我陸相所謂「行動合於天意」一語、尚有冷靜考慮之必要、未可輕易言之也、關於满蒙問題、外部軍部之思想、旣已根本不同、於是對國聯之觀念、亦分尊重與輕蔑兩種主義、兀然對立、遂致满洲事變突起、不但不能利用國聯、反使日本陷於重大不利、</p>
<p>幣原式外交、旣取武力否認主義、國際協調主義、結果當然爲國聯尊重主義、不待言也、自國聯出世以來、日本即爲忠實擁護之一員、至幣原坐上外交椅子、其色彩遂益見濃厚、幣原外交、頗能依賴國聯以牽制美國、於外交上迭占優勝、何以一遇满洲事件、全世界俱變爲敵人、一方面固由外交當局、準備有所未周、而軍部之輕蔑國聯、亦自爲其主要原因也、國聯否認戰爭、標榜以法代力之原則、而我軍部則以正義·人道·和平爲欺人假面具、遂不得不主張武力萬能主義、其與國聯相齟齬、而變爲國聯輕蔑主義、自是在人意中、毫不足怪、</p>
<p>因輕蔑國際聯盟、對於非戰條約、亦當然現出輕蔑之傾向、輕蔑國聯與非戰、結果遂顯出二種現象、第一、謂制裁無力不足畏、至如國際輿論之非難、尤覺半文不值、萬不得已、退出國聯可耳、此種視同兒戲之見解、聞之令人失笑、蓋對付國聯與非戰、在我極感棘手、觀於满洲上海兩事變之經過、不啻明白相告、在軍部身當其衝、豈有毫不自覺之理、不過故作豪語、以自欺欺人而已、第二、因輕蔑國聯與非戰之結果、造出一種强硬意見、即解决满蒙問題時、全然拒絕第三國干涉、凡照國聯規約、遇有紛爭之和平處理方法、一概避忌、不予接受、</p>
<p>凡國際條約、認爲有法律性質者、例如日本謂中國怠棄條約義務、則爲旣成條約上之條文解釋爭執、照國聯規約第十三條、當委諸仲裁或司法審判以解决之、此現代國際政治之常軌也、以此以故、常設國際司法法院規程第三十六條第二項所謂應訴義務、聯盟國必須承受、並應加入一九二八年第九次國聯總會所採用之議定書、方足以表示熱心和平處理國際紛爭之態度、夫應訴義務、三十餘國、皆已承受、在常任理事國中、不承受者、祇有我日本一國、至於議定書、自英法爲始、其他多數國家、均已加入、唯我國尚無加入之表示、其故何也、實因一部分政治家及軍人、極力主張满蒙權益、係從賭國運之戰爭得來、與國家生存、關係重大、遇有紛爭、萬不能聽第三國裁定、雖經外交當局、屢次設法勸首、終不肯改變故態、</p>
<p>擁護满蒙權益、拒絕第三國裁定、此種意見、亦不可謂毫無理由、回憶二十餘年前、我政府因舊租借地房屋稅問題充十分勝訴之成算、出訴於常設仲裁法院、結果與豫期相反、完全敗訴、今又援引此事、謂满蒙問題、交付仲裁或司法審判、亦定於日本不利者、但吾意則不以爲然、何也、現在之常設國際司法機關、已臻十分發達可以信賴之境地、不應妄事猜疑也、然如满鐵並行線問題係由中日密約（譯諸按據我政府宣布並無此項密約）所生之拘束、中國方面、主張時代錯誤、不能適用、請求國聯再審議時、我國將不免有窮於辯論之苦、又如满鐵沿線駐兵權、蘇俄早經放棄、我國逞其頑强、始終延抗不撤、究有何種理由、可與人公庭對簿乎、由此等問題看來、亦安怪我有拒絕第三國裁定或干涉之願望、不過日本對中國之包藏禍心、又恐因此而被人窺見底藴、此吾國所以對於國際司法一層、始終徬徨歧路、不肯前進之實在癥結也、唯是國際紛爭、以和平方式解决、已成世界上一種趨勢、我日本欲以獨力違抗之、庸有幸乎、故不如於適當保留之下、承受應訴義務、并加入議定書、較爲利多害少、此在我賢明之軍部、允宜加以考慮者也、</p>

<h3>國輪業公决水脚收現</h3>

<p>北洋航營衰退　北洋一路烟津青威各埠、本年戰事以後、營業從未起色、始則因銀錢業停止放欵、客帮多不能辦貨、市塲周轉不靈、最近又受日軍攻熱等謡傳、而百貨全停、僅略有麵粉裝載、又以東北線内之華輪、一部移行華北、遂致貨少船多、釀成噸位過剩現象、近來甚至開行一輪、所收水脚、不敷燃煤之用、故無一輪不受虧耗、</p>

<p>二一技譚</p>
<h3>從駿骨說到鷹骨</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>千金市駿當年有，</p>
<p>百萬求鷹今日無：</p>
<p>從此龍宫添鬥力，</p>
<p>戰船拱衛水晶都。</p>
<p>同是一把枯骨頭，有人肯出重價買駿骨，没有人肯出重價買鷹骨；駿骨何其幸？鷹骨何其不幸？</p>
<p>燕昭王千金購駿馬，馬不幸先死了：昭王仍用五百金購得死馬的骸骨而歸。這樁故事，載在戰國策上。死馬的枯骨，還值五百金，千古相傳，以爲美談。</p>
<p>久沈在大海裏的飛鷹戰鬥艦，不是有起絞出海的消息麽？但是，根據粤報記載，起絞出海的計畫，又將取消了。只爲，總部派出美國某工程師，前往查勘和估計：起絞費，約須銀三十餘萬元；修理費，約須八十餘萬元；兩共須銀一百一二十萬元，才能化死鷹爲活鷹。庫中没有這一筆閑欵，這一把鷹骨頭，只好長期沈淪在海底了！</p>
<p>駿骨有人肯出重價購去，鷹骨却没有人肯出重金起絞出海；唉！沈淪的飛鷹，年深月久以後，豈不要和赤壁懷古詩中丨折戟沈沙鐵未消，一例看待麽？</p>
<p>我們海軍部，損失了若干戰鬥力：海龍王的海軍部，當然要增加着若干戰鬥力了。我這一首七言絕句，一詩二用：</p>
<p>一，追悼飛鷹。</p>
<p>二，恭賀海龍王。</p>
<h3>睡豬</h3>
<p>— 江·萍·</p>
<p>國人該醒醒了丨</p>
<p>日本人的隨時隨地侮辱中國人，差不多已成了一種普遍的習慣，他們心目中的中國人，簡直都是束手待斃，任人宰殺的豬仔。</p>
<p>在山田武吉所著的一本日本新满蒙政策裏，有這樣的一句話，兹迻譯如下：</p>
<p>「：：：當這現在的時候，「睡獅」的中國已暴露了他「睡豬」的眞面目，而爲各國俎上之肉。」</p>
<p>這句話的意思是很顯然的；從前外國人所給中國「睡獅」的雅號，山田以爲還不大確當；因爲中國如果眞是睡獅的話，在重重的創傷下也該醒醒而作困獸之鬥了，可是中國不但没有困鬥的準備，而且仍是這樣的一味好睡，那當然不是食人的「獅」而是被食於人的「豬」了！　　我看了這句話後，非常氣憤，但是，平心靜氣地再從歷史上去細細回憶，慚愧，竟找不出一些可以反駁山田的譏訕的資料。</p>
<p>「九一八」「一二八」的兩大變動，日本是一步緊一步的向前進逼，而中國却是一步鬆一步的往後倒退。人民被屠殺了也不引起什麽憤慨，土地被侵佔了也不引起什麽悲哀。政府再三曉諭人民以鎭靜，人民也還以爲火不曾燒到眉毛而在隔岸，還可以觀賞，是痛癢不關，漠然無覺的一種狀態。這些「睡夢正濃」的國民，實在令人有點寒心！</p>
<p>時間過去得很快，第二年的「九一八」又將來臨。朋友們，快些醒醒罷丨只管這樣睡下去，那眞要變做睡豬了丨</p>
<h3>水的界限</h3>
<p>— 俞·人·英·</p>
<p>黄浦江和蘇州河丨</p>
<p>一個星期日的早晨，我覺得很無聊：於是就到白渡橋公園去吸一會比較清新的空氣。這時的人跡很稀少，祇有幾個人在一塊兒打太極拳。</p>
<p>我沿着江濱踱去，眼前就呈現着黄浦江和蘇州河的交界。幾個苦力在撑一隻逆風的船，我很同情的對着他們注視。當我正在觀察江面的時候，却不得不使我驚奇的：爲什麽黄浦江和蘇州河的水流分成一條界限？在黄浦江的一面，是一種含有沙質的深黄色。在蘇州河的一面，是一種好像沉着什麽污澱的黝黑色：儼然彼此不相侵犯的，雖然流水是在澎湃着，儘管往能夠流到的地方鑽。　　使我回憶到往昔閩遊的途中，在某一處的洋面，一面的海水，起伏着碧綠的波紋。而在另一方面，却掏起了令人恐怖的黑浪。</p>
<p>這或許是河與海海與洋的界限吧？</p>
<h3>矛盾的心理</h3>
<p>— 秋·郎·</p>
<p>丨觀察的一般丨</p>
<p>在這畸形的社會中，最容易表現一般人的矛盾心理，略舉如下：一個青年男子，他感到生活的枯澀和單調，他總是不惜犧牲了一切，來追逐着女性，冀求達到最後之目的丨結婚丨等目的達到了，他更感到經濟和其他問題，覺得愛情不足償其損失，他又羨慕着獨身主義者的自由。</p>
<p>居住在農村裏的人們，正渴慕着繁華像神仙世界般的上海，住在上海的人，却又在欣慕農村生活的清幽，恬適。　　站在新的立塲上的摩登女郎，伊們的口號早喊着，「男女平權」「解放」「自由」等等，可是伊們十人中倒有九個，經濟不能獨立，是要倚靠男子生活的，試思怎樣謀「平權，」「求解放，」這不是言行不相符嗎？</p>
<p>「人生不幸爲女子身，」「願祝他生化」</p>
<p>女兒，」這兩句是絕對矛盾的話，究竟誰棄誰取，我從前總難得到明確的解答，如今看到現代的女子，處處占便宜，出風頭，那還是採用第二句爲妙。</p>
<h3>兩種有槍階級</h3>
<p>— 閣·重·樓·</p>
<p>丨彈槍和烟槍丨</p>
<p>槍的種類很多像步槍，手槍，盒子槍，機關槍：：：等，有的便於携帶，有的便於射撃，總刮的說：它是一種殺人的利器。</p>
<p>國家製造槍械，爲的是捍衛疆土，保障國魂，像馬占山將軍東省轉戰，蔡廷鍇將軍淞滬抗日，都是深明大義，各盡其責　不但全國内的同胞齊聲贊美，全世界的人類也都表示同情。</p>
<p>寫了很多的話，還没有寫入正文，我現在要談的兩種有槍階級，一種是勇於内戰而槍口却不敢轉向外的，再一種就是吞雲吐霧的有槍階級了，雖然烟槍和彈槍性質不同，然而我們看見拿烟槍的人不但自已要疲弱而死，妻子也要跟着受累，所以我們認爲烟槍和彈槍，一樣的富於危險性！一樣是殺人的利器！</p>
<p>「槍口向内，」「槍桿向内，」都是自殺政策，都是走入歧途，奉勸這兩種階級中人，從今而後，有槍的「槍口向外，」有槍的「放下槍桿，」那麽我們中華的前途，纔有一線復興的希望！</p>
<p>二十枝譚刊誤諱篇。十一行。石農。誤植不農·十丈輕綸篇。九行。四明。誤植四名。十四行。無比。誤植無味。白頭内使篇。二行。誠惶。誤植誠隍。載笑載言。誤植戴笑戴言。末行。話前塵·誤植誤前塵。一并更正。</p>
<h3>銀絲（十）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>好！我們無須再談舊事，但是你應該想到我以前曾經說過一句話，丨以後一定會　一個機會再見你，而在這時候，却决不是舊時的袁和甫，更不是舊時當小學教員的袁和甫。這句話你該不曾忘掉的吧？這十幾年來吃盡了苦，爲的是你，爲的是國家，我已把生命，名譽，財産，一概置諸度外。咳！芬茗！你老了，無論如何，總是我的罪孽。但是，你知道麽？這一間屋子，當時我那裏知道便是你的家，否則我一定不使敵人的砲，攝掉了你的左右隣居，而使你這屋子孤立得教人可憐。當時我更那裏知道你是住在這鎭上，否則我一定預先找到了你，保護你出險，不使你受一些驚慌。」</p>
<p>「咳！我的屋子？我那裏來自已的屋子！租來的屋子，早已被砲火所轟掉；並且一些東西也不留了。但是，我們的國土没有失掉尺寸，我是十分敬佩你的神勇。眞是僥倖得很，謝謝我的上帝，你還没有老，依然是一個青年的模樣，雖然出入於鋒鏑裏面，你該自已满足而更加努力了。我在報紙上見過你照片，我便很奇怪，怎樣與我的：：：老友是一個神態，我很歡喜，我像發狂的一般，無時無刻不是祝禱你打勝仗，給我民族，爭一些光榮；但是我很悽凉，有時常常自已告訴自已；你的老友是一個小學教員，他呌袁和甫，不是袁人楷，你别痴想吧！丨這樣的錯覺，是多麽愚蠢，多麽可悲呢！」</p>
<p>「是呀。我還記得從前有一次你給我一封信，信裏有兩句話！與其做拜倫的情人，不如做拿破侖的棄婦。我又記得你有一次向我說道：一個男子，應該學中古的騎士，不該學專寫劇</p>
<p>本的莎士比亞。現在我才體會到你的說話，是多麽的偉大！我寗可離開了你，抛棄了家庭，受盡當時許多人的唾駡，而刻苦實行，以至於現在。現在呢，你該满意了。但是，我已和你十多年不曾見面，不曾通音問，今天再見，眞和隔世的人一般了。芬，你的感想，是怎麽樣呢？」</p>
<p>這時樓上的瘋子，忽然在哈哈的大笑，像男子一般地大笑。</p>
<p>「咦！樓上是誰？」袁團長很驚奇，而凝神地聽；並且想走上樓梯。</p>
<p>「咳，可憐是一個瘋子，也是我唯一的同伴，請你不要去瞧伊，伊見了生人，也許會格外地瘋狂，請你原諒我，待我上樓去照呼一下再來伴你說話。」芬若擱住了袁團長而自已上樓。</p>
<p>大門上又有敲著，袁團長正想去開門，而樓上的瘋子，忽然又在痛哭，伊的哭聲，正和三歲的孩子，被人搶了糖果，一樣地悲袁。</p>

<h3>洋厘市價波紋式的升降</h3>
<p>近來金融需求不暢、各業無形停頓對於洋厘市價、本無所謂漲跌、詎昨晨忽因銀行買胃及錢莊供給方面、彼此競爭關係居然盤高厘餘、人心果然添色　究以底充流滯、終則無轉機之可能、於是早市漲後、午市重跌、大有波紋式的起伏升降之概、其實似乎難望升色耳、</p>
<p>早昻午疲之釐價　「洋厘」早市較前午又昻七毫半、爲六錢九分一厘七毫半、午市仍回疲半厘　爲六錢九分一厘二毫半、結果較前午好二毫半、而趨勢當嫌懦弱、恐有續小之虞、「銀拆」早午兩市銀拆均開五分、較前日又小去一分　劃頭加水六七分　銀根鬆象較前日大都彷彿</p>

<h3>標粉跌度尚微</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上下午各月份市面、大致呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價、續小二角左右、因此人心未免看疲、廠家方面、現粉去胃、始終未見大暢、故大廠則盛傳須暫時停車、一面可免現粉之湧積、一面可使收麥易於就範、不過是否存有作用、目下尚難推測、客帮方面、南洋尚有問訊、餘無動靜、故人心雖不佳、跌度尚不尖銳也、九月份至十二月份較前日跌七厘半、一二月份跌一分云、</p>
<h3>期麥都呈平穩之態</h3>
<p>昨期麥上下午各月份市面、都呈平穩、以洋麥報價、雖續小二角左右、惟内地帮方面、以目下之標準、均賴本麥、果若到貨不暢、套入者不多、似於洋麥之報價、無甚大出入、人心之堅、當屬此故、不過廠家無意問訊、非廉不可、照此情形、後步當難擯高也、結果本月份較前日好二分、十月份好一分、十一月份不動、十二月份好一分、一月份好二分、現麥市面、亦趨穩定、開瑶灣麥三兩五錢七分、揚州麥三兩四錢二分、至四錢半、紹興麥三兩四錢、計二千包云、</p>

<h3>五金五金呈平淡局面</h3>
<p>美白鐵客銷無多　美白鐵交易、邇因廢歷中秋節近、各帮均抱觀望、所以成交不多、惟行情緣底存軟薄、故尚挺勃、刻市四十八張每担估十五兩二錢半、二十八號十六兩、二十六號估十五兩、二十四號估十四兩、厚花色行售十三兩五錢云、</p>
<p>新鉛絲現貨已竭　新鉛絲昨開出雖云無多、性市上現貨已覺枯竭所以市盤矗立無斜、如粗花色估十兩光景、中檔花色每担亦可估至十三兩二錢半、細檔花色每担估十八兩二錢半、查交易係粗中兩檔開出爲最多、細檔因成交較少、故市較靜云、</p>

<h3>九一八紀念</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>七日東京電，日本全國，刻作種種布置，準備舉行九一八紀念，</p>
<p>同日南京電，教部通令各省市教廳局，轉飭所屬各校，遵照中央規定辦法，紀念九一八國難，</p>
<p>同一紀念，同一九一八紀念，不知我國人對於此種紀念，感想若何，而日人之對於此種紀念，感想又若何，我國人之對於日人紀念，感想若何，而日人之對於我國紀念，感想又若何，各有自已的立塲，各人自有其感想，原可置之不論，</p>
<p>我國的紀念固多，而國恥的紀念，尤爲進步，若將我國所有的國恥，一一而紀念之，我恐與星期日同一忙碌，正爲我國國恥之多，而國人的腦筋，麻木不仁，幾不知紀念爲何事，而紀念日之得以休假者，猶如從前三月廿八之迎神賽會，七月十五日之蘭盆勝會等等，同一歡迎，此種紀念，試問可憐不可憐？　　經過一度國恥，看看我國之朝野情形如何，心理如何，依舊，復經過一次國難，再看看當局之措施如何，國民之行動如何，又依舊，古人所謂「蹶一次者長一智，」而我國愈蹶而愈不振，難道我國人的頭腦特别異於人麽？不過一次紀念，二次紀念，三次四次紀念，常此紀念下去，總有一次最大的紀念，換言之就是末次的紀念，若竟到此地步，我恐雖欲紀念而亦不可得，</p>
<p>自歐洲大戰停止以來，於今不過十五六年，當時德國之軍備財政，受恊約國之控制，幾乎無翻身之日，而六日柏林電，德國防部長施萊轍，在閱兵時發表激昻演詞，謂德國不能再忍受二等國待遇，東普魯士，尤應準備防緊危險云云，可知十餘年中，而德國將完全恢復其從前之武力，我念及此，不禁感慨係之，</p>

<p>植物需要的養分　我們知道，植物在生長的時候，需要的養分有碳素，水素，酸素·窒素·燐酸·鉀·鐵·硫黄等十種，尤其是極酸·鉀（加里）窒素（　）三種原素是最屬重要，燐酸和加里在植物細胞生成上是必要的成分，若使一旦缺了這兩種元素，就不能使得細胞增殖，窒素却是植物體内蛋白質和其餘有機物構成上不可缺的一種最緊要的元素，所以供給若是不充分的時候，作物就難於發育，</p>
<p>水産肥料的成分　水産肥料裏面，對於這三項要素，大都是完全無缺，像韞粕和鰊粕是含着很多窒素的肥料</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>粕和鯨骨鱈骨等是含着很多燐酸的肥料，一般海藻類，却都有加里的肥料，所以若使能夠應用學理製造起來，可說是再好没有的了，不過須注意的，水産動植物在普通總以供食用，工用，藥用，爲主，若是特地的拿來製造肥料，那是太不合算了，所以除非在豐漁和銷路滯隘的時候或是價值低賤的瘠瘦魚類作這種原料外，其餘都是利用食用品化製品的副産物，加以適當的處理或者混合着其他物品製成的，</p>
<p>水産肥料的種類　因爲牠的製法不同，可以分成下列五種，（一）乾製肥料（二）壓榨料（三）化製肥料（四）混淆肥料（五）雜肥料</p>
<p>各種肥料的製法　（一）乾製肥料，牠是取魚介類的全體或是一部分，乾燥起來製成的，不過原料一定要新鮮並且要少含脂肪，（二）壓榨肥料，是把魚介類煑熟以後，壓榨分離牠的脂肪和水分，然後乾燥製成的，這種功效要比第一種爲顯著，因爲一煑熟能夠使蛋白質凝固，在貯藏時間中不致容易引起腐敗，而肥料分的分解，依着脂肪的融解，水分的壓去，製品乾燥却是比較容易得多，並且將來使用的時候，也不致因着脂肪的多量存在使得肥料成分的分解遲緩，再壓出的魚油，又是有用的副産物，這才呌做一舉而兩得呢，（三）化製肥料，就是使用化學方法製造的，水産肥料中，能夠使用化製法的很多，像鯨骨，海豚骨·魚骨·介殻·海藻等，不過現在對於提倡國産孰重銓民族生存照用劣貨民族淪亡</p>
<p>這種原料製成肥料的，都不過是粉碎之乾燥之罷了，實在因爲我國科學的落後，簡直没有利用化學方法的，這樣要牠的成績好，價格高，豈不是痴人說夢，（四）混淆肥料，把魚腸血液等煑汁，混和着木炭，和土壤等製造成功的，（五）雜肥料，除了上面所講四種以外，凡是一切魚介類，苔藻類和石灰，滷汁等，無特别的製造的，都屬於這一類，</p>

<h3>關於改革早婚流幣之補充</h3>
<p>— 文·炳·</p>
<p>讀本日（六日）浣花君提議改革早婚流弊一文理透言順，最切時弊：心折之下，末議圖參，爰走筆草述是篇，郵登本欄，旨在「引玉」已耳。</p>
<p>浣君對早婚成因，缺而未詳，特爲略加補充，尋根究柢，形成我國早婚陋習之原由有四：</p>
<p>（一）我國社會因受自然環境之支配，而又歷鮮推動歷史車輪之時代人物，故過去四千餘年，朝代雖有遞嬗，但是總長夜漫漫的在封建漩渦中翻觔斗：組成此種社會集體之單位，是爲家族，某一家族之能否在社會上獨佔優越地位，以其中口多寡爲準則：以此遂無形促成一般人早婚早育，以冀人　蕃衍　爲　爭光。</p>
<p>（二）因封建社會之經濟結構單純，謀生比較容易：遂使一般人不以婚嫁及家庭爲累，是亦形成早婚之一因。</p>
<p>（三）由以上兩種原因，漸漸形成一般人之視線，對某人品評，恒首重子孫衆多，所謂「多子多福，」「有人即財，」「早生貴子，」已成爲通常恭維語：於是遂使年壯有子者，生出「抱孫心切」的渴慕心理，未成年之男女，亦以及早成婚，早生兒女爲榮。</p>
<p>（四）尚有一極大原因，即爲我國科學不發達，教育不普及，一般人罔知早婚爲害之烈：於是大家閉眼盲從流俗，不問成效，不顧利弊，陳陳相沿，風氣尚矣，</p>
<p>基於以上四因，乃遂形成我國今日之早婚陋習，其流弊現象，浣君已列舉綦詳，毋庸贅述，兹余尚有言者，是爲今後應如何施行改革耳。</p>
<p>對症下藥，鄙見如是：</p>
<p>（一）法令方面：各主管地方之法令機關，應嚴訂條文，舉辦婚姻登記，男子未满二十，女子不及十八者，絕對禁止結婚，如有違反法定年齡，秘密結婚者，一經查出，科罰重金。</p>
<p>（二）教育方面：在中學以上，酌添婚姻研究一課，每週授課一小時，延聘深有研究之人主教其間，用科學方法，理喻學生：此外如生理衛生等課，亦應注意及此，隨時加以討論，使一般學生率皆利害曉然，從而首爲之倡，改革早婚。</p>
<p>（三）新聞界方面：凡由早婚而引起之社會新聞：如因早婚以致生計艱難，自殺，或因此以致男女體質衰萎，早世，或所育子女不强，夭殤，新聞記者應詳加闡明，曉示社會人士，以昭來者之戒。</p>
<p>（四）私人方面：凡一般旣知旣覺之私人，應以身作則，絕不任性早婚：並隨時隨地作有力之文字或口頭宣傳，使見聞之者，潛移理化，深明早婚之害。</p>
<p>上列四法，除（一）係消極的外，餘三條皆爲積極辦法，易行而又有效。</p>
<p>此問題倘能依法解决，不獨有利於單别私人，其於民族國家之强盛，更有莫大之關係在焉，賢彦碩達，曷不詳加討論！</p>
<p>一封書</p>
<h3>情書</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>摯愛的亞孟：</p>
<p>我在病中收着你寄自榆關的第三信了。亞孟！你可知道你所關懷的英昨天還在利害的病着哩。啊！雖然我的體温很高，可是從不曾一刻忘却你所給與我的恩愛，以及你正在萬里長征中等候着我的消息。然而，亞孟！你可知道狠毒的醫生是無論如何也不會允許我給你寫信的呀，我徒然是忍痛的掙扎着起來遭受看護婦兩次三番的禁止。</p>
<p>其實，亞孟！我簡直失却了執筆的手力，我猜得準，假如你看着我這瘦弱的手臂，你一定會傷心落淚。然而我的精神却十分健康，這是可使我親愛的亞孟稍可安心的。不是嗎？只要我的精神不死，我始終是爲你祝福的呀！</p>
<p>亞孟！我病了喲！當我病到萬分痛苦的時候，我常是傷心的默念着：　　丨亞孟！你回來喲！你在什麽地方呀？你爲什麽不來看我呢？你的訪問是可能醫治我的呀！：：：天呀！你將我的人兒帶到那裏去了呢？難道就不能讓我在未死之前再見他一面嗎？</p>
<p>啊！我這樣呼喊着，當然你是不會聽見的，可是與我同一病房的人們，都因着我的瘋狂而嘆息。而且我的同學萍姊有一次爲我拭着眼淚說：</p>
<p>丨别這樣吧，你得了解，你的丈夫是一個中華民族的鬭士，一個民族的死亡比較你的疾病更重要得多哩：何况他現在還不知道你在害病。</p>
<p>我痴果的望着她那顫抖的嘴唇，我感覺無限的慚愧。其後他還說：</p>
<p>丨你應當這樣想，你應當這樣忍痛的寛恕你的丈夫。</p>
<p>於是我只會藏着頭盡情的痛哭，原來我不能像一個孩子似的去眷戀一個反帝國主義的革命者呀！</p>
<p>今天我再將你的來信重讀了兩遍，每讀一遍，總有一種新的恩情深重的刻劃在我的心頭。祇有你的一字一句才能安慰我寂寞的心情，更使我對你的信心無窮的加重。</p>
<p>在你的來信中使我迷惑在關外的砲聲中，「皇軍」的進攻熱河更使我切齒仇恨日帝國主義的殘暴而戰慄。你說你的身體十分健强，可是我却想像得出你的肉體是十分疲乏。至於你的精神當然是愉快的，因爲我相信你的事業會結與你無限的慰安。雖然我們的分離會使你感受凄清，但是，這决不致於影響你偉大的信仰吧。我的亞孟！我現在完全懂得，我們須得爲被壓迫民族奮鬥而置愛情於身外，我們决不能花前月下的等候着帝國主義的割宰；何况你的妻正在誠摯的期待着你的成功，這個愛情的鼓勇，至少可使你得着相當的助力罷。</p>
<p>再說：我們是恩愛的夫妻，同時也是革命的伴侣，我没有機會跟着你一同前去，可是我怎能使你爲了我而懈怠你自身的工作呢？我們知道而且相信：我們决不可因着愛情而損傷我們倆固有的觀念，因爲共有的觀念動摇，不啻是毁滅自身的愛情。我親愛的同志！聽着罷，我們必須永遠堅定着我們的意志，不要開始損傷我們的愛情！亞孟！一個眞的革命者，决不會受累於兒女們：你相信這句話嗎？</p>
<p>但是，亞孟！我畢竟是女性，在劇病的時候，我還渴望着你能立刻歸來。現在我却清醒的克服了我的感情，我已覺醒了我對你的責任了。至於上面所寫的病中的呼號，你該會懂得那是病態而不致引你的Ｓentiment吧。那末我爲什麽要如此的向你告白呢？這是我對於你的純眞而不能有所藏隱。</p>
<p>醫生在禁止我再往下寫去，就此停止。</p>
<p>醫生告訴我一星期後便可出院，我眞喜，請爲我快樂。</p>
<p>窗外的雨聲瀝瀝，我的心頭又是凄凉又是興奮。敬祝你殺！殺！殺！殺盡敵人浴血歸來！</p>
<p>屬於你的病人英上</p>
<p>Ｘ月Ｘ日於三等病室中。</p>

        <h1>1932.09.10</h1>
<h3>Is America and Russia truly preparing a joint effort against Japan?</h3>
<p>Time flies like a white colt passing through a crack. The Manchurian puppet organization, created by Japan through force, has been in existence for six months since its establishment. When it was established, on March 12th, it requested recognition from various countries. At that time, both Chinese and foreign attention was focused on the Shanghai Incident. However, the world knew that the puppet organization was a Japanese puppet, so no country recognized it. As a result, Japan also hesitated and did not recognize it. However, Japan believed that if it recognized the puppet organization, all its future actions in Northeast China to destroy treaties could be falsely claimed to be done by the puppet organization, which would not involve Japan and avoid its responsibility, which would be of great benefit to Japan. Therefore, it is now preparing to brazenly proceed with the recognition of the puppet organization, regardless of everything.</p>
<p>Japan cannot but have some concerns about recognizing the puppet organization. The League of Nations opposed Japan's recognition of the puppet organization, and the Investigation Team expressed this early on when it was in Japan. This is because if Japan recognizes the puppet organization, it will not only show contempt for international conventions, but also violate the resolutions of previous League of Nations conferences. The impact of this will not be limited to China alone. The League of Nations' opposition is something that Japan cannot ignore. In addition, the United States and Russia, one deeply fears that Japan will invade Northern Manchuria and then gradually encroach on Siberia and the Maritime Province, and the other, in order to compete for Pacific hegemony, absolutely does not want to allow Japan to monopolize the resources of the Northeast, both oppose Japan's recognition of the puppet organization. Therefore, Japan is also uneasy about these two countries and is trying to find a way to deal with them.</p>
<p>Now, Japan's preparations for recognizing the puppet organization are becoming more urgent. According to foreign dispatches, the resumption of relations between Russia and the United States, which have fundamentally incompatible ideologies, has gradually improved and is becoming more concrete. The United States will allow Soviet Russia to issue bonds in the United States, Russia will recognize a portion of its old debts to the United States, and will allow the United States to establish a naval base in the Kamchatka Peninsula. If this agreement becomes a reality, it may be a preparation for the two countries to jointly deal with Japan. This has a profound relationship with the future changes in the situation in East Asia, which we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Whether the resumption of relations between the United States and Russia can become a reality and when it will become a reality, we dare not speculate. However, assuming that the resumption of relations between the two countries can be realized in the near future, it would be beneficial to both countries. This can be asserted. For example: (1) The United States can immediately get rid of its isolation. (2) American investment and goods can obtain a vast market. (3) Japan, in view of the cooperation between the two countries, may restrain its ambitions and leave room for the United States. This is from the perspective of the United States, and it is beneficial to the United States. Furthermore, from the perspective of Russia, there are also many benefits. For example, it will no longer be easy to create an anti-Russian united front of capitalist countries. Once there is a conflict between Russia and Japan, Russia will not be isolated and helpless, and sacrificed alone. The assistance of American materials can promote the progress of its domestic construction projects. Russia is eager for the resumption of relations to become a reality. However, I don't know if the traditionally conservative United States has the courage to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>The hope that the United States and Russia will move from approaching each other to resuming diplomatic relations may not be unrelated to Russia's unremitting self-improvement. If Russia is internally unstable and its border defenses are not well-maintained, let alone the call for the resumption of relations between the United States and Russia, it will not be possible to occur due to fundamental ideological differences. Moreover, I fear that the Japanese army may have already pressed the border, and Russia's national fortune will fall into the abyss of darkness, making it difficult to extricate itself. This is what we must pay attention to.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country's response to Japan, the recovery of lost territory is unlikely. Comparatively, the only force against Japan is the arduous struggle of the Northeast Volunteer Army. However, Mutō's arrival will make the suppression of our Volunteer Army its important task. Uchida recently made a lot of noise, saying, "Many people believe that if Japan recognizes Manchuria, the countries of the world will interfere with Japan. However, according to information obtained by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the countries are currently in economic panic and have no energy to be involved in the Far East issue. Even if a certain country comes out to interfere, Japan has already determined that interference will be futile." Alas, Uchida made such arrogant remarks. Can the countries bear it? I don't have time to delve into whether the countries can bear it or not, but I hope that the people of the country will reflect deeply, pool their wisdom and efforts, and jointly implement effective measures for self-rescue, so as not to allow the arrogance of those who invade us to increase day by day.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>The Volunteer Army Attacks Dashiqiao Station Again</h3>
<p>Dashiqiao Bombed, Japanese Military Train Derailed</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Attacks Nü'erhe Station on the Fengshan Railway</p>
<p>(Dalian) At 1:30 this morning, about 300 Volunteer Army soldiers attacked Dashiqiao Station on the South Manchuria Railway again. The Japanese side responded with police officers and railway guards. The Japanese side suffered more than a dozen casualties each. They retreated at dawn. Currently, all trains on the line are suspended and traffic is chaotic. (9th China United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Dalian) This morning, the Volunteer Army attacked Dashiqiao on the South Manchuria Railway again, bombing the railway. As a result, a Japanese military train derailed and overturned, killing and wounding 15 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army received a telegram and sent a guard team from Haicheng to Dashiqiao, but it was too late. (9th China United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) A Japanese aircraft flew low over Yu and scattered leaflets at 10:30 AM on the 9th, saying, "The sorghum is ripe, harvest it quickly!" It circled for about ten minutes before flying east. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) The Volunteer Army is constantly appearing and disappearing along the Fengshan Railway. Nü'erhe was suddenly attacked at 4:00 AM yesterday. There were only eight Japanese soldiers at the station, and two were killed and six were injured. The Japanese army in the front area has been stationed near Sanshan for some time, searching for the Volunteer Army, but they are shooting aimlessly. Gunfire can be faintly heard in Yuguan, especially clearly at night. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Volunteer Army Recovers He and Advances on Fushun</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is heard that the Northeast Volunteer Army has advanced on Fushun again. There is a large coal mine there, which is related to the South Manchuria Railway. Therefore, the Japanese and Manchurian troops stationed there are very alarmed. It is also heard that the Volunteer Army has captured five Japanese instructors of the "Manchukuo", and a part of the army under Zhu of the "Manchukuo" has revolted and joined the Volunteer Army, and is now preparing to jointly attack Shenyang. (9th Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Jilin Volunteer Army Severely Wounded the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Jilin Volunteer Army has at least 50,000 soldiers, and has now been renamed the National Salvation Army. It is said that they recently severely wounded the Japanese army, killing as many as 150 enemies in one battle. It is also said that they expect to recover Changchun or Jilin City before October. (9th Reuters)</p>
<h3>A Puppet Fengshan Railway Train Attacked</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A train of Fengshan Railway passenger cars is parked south of the Yuguan station platform. Most of them are converted from South Manchuria cars. They depart from Shenyang three times a day at 9:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and 6:00 PM. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 8th, an express train on the Fengshan Railway from Shenyang to Yuguan was ambushed by more than 300 Volunteer Army soldiers when it arrived at Xinglong Station. The locomotive was hit by eight shells, killing one driver and wounding one cook. The train overturned, injuring a total of eleven passengers. The railway guard team fought fiercely with the Volunteer Army on the 9th. All the station staff fled. The Japanese sent a team from Xinmin to assist. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Shenyang Volunteer Army Plans to Occupy the Arsenal</h3>
<p>(Beiping) On the night of the 7th, more than 100 Shenyang Volunteer Army soldiers broke in from the Xiaodongbianmen earthen city and rushed to Xiaoheyan, planning to occupy the arsenal. They were blocked by Japanese tanks and fought fiercely for several hours. Shenyang is becoming more and more terrifying. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mutō Returned to Shenyang from Dalian Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Manchuria, General Mutō Nobuyoshi, returned to Shenyang from Dalian at 3:30 PM today. Lieutenant General Itagaki Seishirō, advisor to the puppet executive, arrived in Shenyang by plane at 7:40 AM this morning. He is scheduled to discuss the new treaty with Manchuria drafted by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs with Ambassador Mutō tonight or tomorrow morning. If the negotiations go well, he will go to Changchun to meet with Puyi and ask the puppet executive to sign it, as Japan's formal recognition of Manchukuo. (9th China United News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Battle History of Feng Zhanhai's Troops</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhanhai's representative, Mr. Men, came to Ping from Shulan to talk. The army was originally the guard regiment of the Jilin Governor's Office, with more than 7,000 officers and soldiers. After the traitor Xi Qia surrendered to Japan, Feng resisted the enemy with this team. The police and armor all came to join, and it increased from one regiment to one brigade.

The speech was very long, and he said at the end, "We are now in such a difficult and critical environment. Commemorating the Premier's first uprising has two major significance, which should be deeply understood. First, the development of the national movement must come from internal and external troubles. Let everyone realize the national renaissance movement. Second, to do the revolutionary movement, there must be a very strong unity and a clear direction. If the interior is broken and the direction is changed, not only will there be external destruction, but you will fall into a situation of failure. The lesson learned by our party is that it has suffered repeated failures because the interior cannot be united. The current environment is the same as in the Sino-Japanese War. At this moment, Japanese imperialists are oppressing the Chinese nation. Our party is guiding the people with political power to resist the oppression of Japanese imperialists. We must have a very solid organization and effort, and take the experience we have gained in the past as our lesson for the future. If we truly unite the interior and use the power of the entire nation, then any difficulty will not be enough to shake the survival of our nation and the foundation of our country. This is what everyone should pay attention to when holding the commemoration meeting today, so that everyone can work together and walk on the road of national rejuvenation and complete the unfinished business of the Premier."

<h3>Robbery at the Nanjing Branch of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>Five Robbers Make off with Over Ten Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Nanjing Police Offer Reward for Arrest</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today at around 10:00 AM, five people suddenly arrived at the Chengbei Branch of the Bank of China on Xuejia Alley. Two were dressed in long gowns, and three in short jackets. One of them carried a large black leather suitcase. The bank's security guard thought they were depositors and paid no attention. The two men in long gowns each drew pistols from their sleeves, pointing them at the guard and the reception room. The three in short jackets fired two shots. One ran to the manager's office, and the other to the teller window. The man carrying the small leather suitcase drew a small knife from his sleeve and cut the telephone line. Wang Ren, the branch manager, had just gone to the main jewelry store in Chengnan. The robbers entered the manager's office, urgently asking where the manager was. Those who replied said he had already gone to the main store in Chengnan. The robbers drove all the employees into the dining room, guarded by the two men in long gowns. The man carrying the small leather suitcase opened the suitcase and sorted out the banknotes in the counter, not taking any one-yuan bills. After filling the suitcase, they left together, taking only five to six minutes. The amount of cash stolen was a staggering 17,000 yuan. After the robbers fled, the bank's security guard and employees urgently reported to the police and scattered to give chase, but they disappeared without a trace. The police department has dispatched a detective squad to investigate. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Lin Shi Discusses Northeast Postal Service</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Lin Shi, Director of the Postal Department, spoke about the Northeast postal service. The Japanese had been coveting it for some time. After the September 18th Incident, they detained our mail, insulted our postal workers, and forcibly seized it. To associate with the puppet organization would be no different from compromise. In general, the blockade of the Northeast postal service was not done for the sake of blockade, but was a reluctantly chosen cessation of operations, leading to the current state of blockade. Outsiders, not understanding the situation, have criticized it greatly, which is deeply regrettable. Foreign policy is a comprehensive strategy of the National Government and cannot be altered by one department. Before the Japanese could fully seize, plunder, and arrange things, our country resolutely suspended postal services in the three provinces and withdrew all postal workers, dealing a significant blow to the other side. The over three thousand postal workers who packed their bags and entered the passes showed the character of our nation. The lost territories of the three provinces will one day be recovered, and everything will be ours. Conversely, if the country changes color and the land falls, the postal service cannot exist alone. He hopes that the people will understand the government's measures and jointly plan for the recovery of the Northeast. (9th Dispatch)</p>

According to a message from a Chinese person, he saw bandits escorting Mrs. Pawley, who was riding a donkey, but did not see Mr. Corkran. Although the Japanese authorities and the "Manchukuo" authorities are making every effort to find the two, they are concerned for their lives. It is now known that the Japanese authorities had warned Pawley and others not to ride outside Niuzhuang, but they ignored the warning, so they encountered danger. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The British Consul-General in Shenyang, Isdahl, has asked General Muto, commander of the Japanese forces in Manchuria, to find a way to rescue Mrs. Pawley and Mr. Corkran.

The British and Japanese consuls in Niuzhuang, after receiving the information, have instructed the "Manchukuo" Niuzhuang Defense Commander to negotiate for their rescue. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Content of Lytton Report Circulated by Japanese Side</h3>
<p>Japan Plans to Submit Counter Proposal Style Opinion</p>
<p>Italy Attempts to Overthrow League of Nations Investigation Report</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 9th - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday telegraphed its representative office in Geneva to notify the League of Nations Secretariat that Japan will submit its opinion on the Manchurian case simultaneously with the Lytton Report, so that they can be reviewed simultaneously. Originally, the League of Nations Investigation Team was requested by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and dispatched with the consent of the Council. Today, after the investigation, Japan is disrespecting the Lytton Report and submitting another opinion, intending to disrupt the General Assembly. Japan's fickle diplomatic policy has aroused resentment among European and American people.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th - According to seemingly reliable sources, the Lytton Investigation Report acknowledges that restoring Manchuria to its former status is impossible. Therefore, it recommends that it be designated as a demilitarized zone and granted autonomy, assisted by Japanese advisors. China would nominally enjoy sovereignty over the territory. The report also recommends that Japan, China, and the "Manchukuo puppet state" be instructed to engage in direct negotiations, monitored by the League of Nations. Japanese political circles commented on this news, saying that while Japan intends to recognize the "Manchukuo puppet state" in the near future, it can also persuade the "Manchukuo puppet state" to negotiate with China in the future.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Tokyo, 9th - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified the League of Nations Secretariat that Japan is preparing to send its opinion to the League of Nations within four to six weeks of receiving the League of Nations Investigation Team's report, so that it can be compared with the report. This opinion should be discussed together with the report by the League of Nations Council. It is expected that if the League of Nations Investigation Team's report can reach Tokyo by the end of this month, Japan's reply will be sent out by around November 10th.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th - According to news received today by official sources here from Beiping, Japan has largely won on all points, so it should be satisfied with the Lytton Investigation Team's report. The source of this news was not specified, but it was said to come from parties related to the investigation team. According to them, the content of the report is as follows: (1) It recounts the disputes between China and Japan but does not make judgments; (2) It states that Japanese individuals assisted in the establishment of "Manchukuo", but the Japanese government did not support it, but later supported it because it saw that the new country was friendly to Japan; (3) It declares that the actions of Japanese soldiers, although believing themselves not to have exceeded the scope of self-defense, the Japanese military authorities actually exceeded the necessity of self-defense; (4) The report does not contain the word "aggression"; (5) It states that the Chinese Volunteers were assisted by Zhang Xueliang. Tokyo has heard that the report contains chapters on the following matters: (A) The situation of disturbances within China; (B) Japan's rights in the three eastern provinces; (C) The need for Japan to open up the resources of the three eastern provinces; (D) The war history after September 18th; (E) Economic situation; (F) Anti-Japanese movement. Tokyo also heard that the recommendations in the Lytton Report contain a caveat that if any changes occur at this time, the conclusion should be revised. The so-called changes probably refer to Japan's recognition of Manchukuo.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Scathingly Criticizes Japan's Policy Towards Manchuria</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - The Manchester Guardian today published an editorial scathingly criticizing Japan's policy in Manchuria, saying that Manchuria is not comparable to Korea, nor can it be allowed to become like Korea. However, there is still talk of delaying the publication of the Lytton Investigation Team's report, fearing that its conclusions may offend Japan. Professor Murray, Chairman of the League of Nations Association, wrote a letter to the communications column of the Manchester Guardian, saying that the League of Nations cannot abandon the path of fairness and justice out of fear of Japan's withdrawal. He meant that to govern a land as large as France and Germany, with a population of thirty million Han, Manchu, and Korean people, requires the strongest countries in the world to bear this responsibility. If Japan is not assisted by other major powers, this kind of undertaking, even if it desires temporary local success, is unattainable. He firmly believes that the failure of Japan's policy is ultimately unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Bolivian Troops Take Offensive, Paraguay Mobilizes</h3>

<p>Havas, Asuncion, Paraguay, 8th - Official sources believe that the Bolivian action of occupying the Falcon fort is an offensive. The people of Paraguay remain calm as usual. Although the situation is extremely serious, the government's attitude remains extremely calm and decisive.</p>

<h3>US Adopts Cautious Attitude Towards Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Seeks Effective Cooperation with League of Nations</p>
<p>Japan Believes Puppet State Will Not Be Bothered for Now</p>
<p>Kokumin, Washington, 8th - Today, key figures indicated that although the US government, because of the Nine-Power Treaty, urgently desires to protect China's sovereignty as much as possible, it has decided to temporarily adopt a policy of non-interference regarding Japan's imminent recognition of the so-called "Manchukuo." It is said that the US State Department is currently adopting a cautious and prudent policy, hoping that it can be effective. Its diplomatic strategy is to effectively cooperate with the League of Nations and maintain an international united front to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. It is believed here that if the US protests Japan's recognition of Manchukuo, it will not only be ineffective but will also undermine the international united front.</p>

<h3>South Manchuria Railway Employees Reject President Hayashi</h3>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 9th - 30,000 employees of the South Manchuria Railway Company have jointly rejected the new President, Count Hayashi Hirotaro, saying that an educator is not fit to bear this difficult situation, which has made President Hayashi in Tokyo feel quite stuck. It is rumored that someone is manipulating this behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th - President Hayashi of the South Manchuria Railway, shortly after taking office, has already had a direct conflict with the employees of the South Manchuria Railway. Hayashi has now returned to Tokyo to explain the truth and his position to all parties, requesting understanding. As the period for recognizing the puppet state is imminent, and the South Manchuria Railway has extremely important responsibilities, the government is determined to quickly resolve this issue.</p>
<h3>Attempted Assassination of Emperor to be Sentenced Soon</h3>

<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th - Lee Bong-chang, a Korean who threw hand grenades at the Emperor's car at Sakuradamon in Tokyo on January 8th of this year in an attempt to assassinate the Emperor, has been decided to be attached to a special court department as a result of the trial by the Supreme Court.

<h3>Using Military Dogs to Guard South Manchuria Railway Line</h3>

With the help of military dogs, it will scout out the residences of the Volunteer Army for combat.</p>
<h3>Hindenburg Returns to Berlin, Meets with Premier and Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>New Parliament Scheduled to Reconvene on the 12th</p>
<p>Hitler Accuses President of Being Old and Incapable</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 8th - Today, Hindenburg and Papen held internal political talks for half an hour. Government sources claim that this conversation shows that the President and the Premier are in complete agreement. After Papen left, the President met with Foreign Minister Neurath. Papen then met with the Speaker of the House, Nazi politician Göring, and decided that the House will reconvene on September 12th in accordance with the previously resolved procedure. The government will issue a declaration. Kokumin, Berlin, 9th - This morning, German President Hindenburg met with the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Congress for more than twenty-five minutes in closed-door talks. Afterwards, the Prime Minister's Office claimed that Speaker Göring had suggested to the President that the Nazi Party and the Center Party form a new cabinet. The President reserved his decision on this, but reiterated his confidence in the Papen cabinet. According to well-informed sources, it is anticipated that the President will order the dissolution of Congress by the end of next week.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, 8th - Yesterday, the leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, publicly accused the Head of State Hindenburg of being old and incompetent during a speech. This matter has aroused deep impressions in political circles, public opinion circles, and ordinary people. Hitler's remarks indicated that Hindenburg is eighty-five years old and about to die, while he himself is young and promising and can wait for his death to replace him. This arrogant attitude has been criticized even by the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, which once extremely supported Hitler, as painful, not only lacking intelligence, but also completely lacking respect for the elderly, and not understanding the principles of social organization. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the entire Nazi Party unanimously agrees with this kind of speech by its leader.</p>
<h3>De Valera Decides to Attend League of Nations Regular Meeting</h3>

If so, the Administrative Council, which begins on September 23rd, will be chaired by De Valera, and the League of Nations General Assembly, which opens on September 26th, will also be chaired by De Valera.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Hopes and the Royalists in Disagreement</h3>
<p>Presidential Resignation Not Approved</p>
<p>Reuters, Athens, 9th – The political turmoil in Greece is developing. Prime Minister Venizelos has submitted his cabinet's resignation to President Zaimis. It is reported that the President advised him to remain in office pending the results of the September 25th election. Prime Minister Venizelos has had disagreements with Royalist leader Tsaldaris for many years, which became more decisive this Sunday. This was because Mr. Venizelos delivered an election speech attacking the former royal family, saying that the disasters suffered by Greece were caused by the personal politics of the former leaders of the royal family and their stubborn insistence on restoration despite the warnings of major powers. Tsaldaris immediately protested to the President, opposing this revolutionary rhetoric and requesting the President to intervene to guarantee the freedom of the future election and to show respect for the will of the people. President Zaimis refused his request, saying that the President should be above party affiliation. Tsaldaris then declared to the public that if the Royalists were to gain power, they would definitely not raise the issue of restoration. Prime Minister Venizelos then returned to Athens from Crete and submitted his resignation so that the President could act freely. However, it is reported that Mr. Venizelos also advised the President not to accept his resignation, fearing serious consequences.</p>
<h3>Gloomy Danube Economic Conference</h3>
<p>France Refuses to Lend Money to Central European Countries Again</p>
<h3>Italian and French Representatives Clash</h3>
<p>National Press, Rome, 8th – The Stresa Conference concluded its debates today and entered the committee meeting stage. Conflicts have now arisen between France and Italy. Britain and Germany are helping France, intentionally isolating Italy. The dispute arose because France opposed directly providing financial aid to the Danube states and proposed a joint agreement to handle the surplus agricultural products of the Danube states, thereby reviving the economies of these states. Italy strongly opposed a joint agreement and advocated that both parties should arrange and collect funds from various countries and distribute them based on the amount of grain exported by each state in the past three years.</p>

<h3>Startling Robbery in a Bustling London Street</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th – A shocking robbery occurred here this afternoon. The location was in one of London's busiest streets. The incident occurred when a person suddenly broke into a large jewelry store on Oxford Street when the street was crowded with pedestrians. The robber immediately closed the door, lowered the curtains, and ordered the two assistants, one deputy manager, and one woman in the room to raise their hands. The robber then completely emptied the jewelry boxes, retreated to the door, and fled. By the time the jeweler called the police, the robber had disappeared without a trace. It is reported that robberies in the West End of London are rare.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Bluemner's Promotion to Ambassador to France</h3>
<p>But the News Could Not Be Verified</p>
<p>National Press, London, 8th – It is widely rumored here that the British Ambassador to China, Bluemner, will be promoted to Ambassador to France, succeeding Tyrrell. However, inquiries with people in the Foreign Office have not been able to confirm this. It is reported that Mr. Bluemner is currently on a long leave back in England and is scheduled to return to China at the end of the year. This is because Mr. Bluemner has been serving as an envoy to China for five and a half years without returning home, and he has been particularly laborious in mediating the Shanghai war. Therefore, he has taken a longer leave to rest. As for Ambassador to France Tyrrell, it is expected that he will retire at the end of the year. There are various speculations about his successor, and the authorities are also carefully considering it. Mr. Bluemner already has the qualifications of an ambassador, and his friends all feel that he will be able to perform his duties happily after being transferred to Paris.</p>
<h3>The British Textile Workers' Strike Turns Serious Again</h3>

<p>A Prelude to the Resumption of Relations Between the United States and Russia</p>

This film depicts the American people's abuse of black people. The Soviet Russian authorities feared that this anti-American film would provoke resentment from the Americans, so they ordered it to be stopped. However, the official announcement of the reason for the ban was that the equipment was incomplete.</p>
<h3>The Young King of Annam Returns to His Homeland</h3>

The Governor-General of Annam, Chamin, the Prime Minister, and representatives of the Annam government came to greet him on the gunboat "Alerte". After the two ships exchanged salutes as usual, the "Alerte" approached the "Dumont d'Urville" and carried the young king across the river. Shortly after, they arrived at the capital. The people of Annam from all provinces came to admire his elegance, and the crowds were huge.</p>

<h3>Major Ishimaru Criticizes the Japanese Government's Responsibility for the September 18th Incident (3)</h3>
<p>An Abridged Translation of Japan's War Against the World</p>
<p>丨Knowing Full Well There Is No Justification for a Legal Contest丨</p>
<p>丨Therefore, Resolutely Rejecting Arbitration by a Third Party丨</p>
<p>When the League of Nations, which advocates morality, criticizes Japan's propositions and attitude, we should understand that it is by no means insulting Japan. It is because Japan has suddenly taken a great step backward, reenacting the power politics of the past, not using peaceful means to resolve disputes, but resorting directly to force, so it has to be corrected. I believe that for a great nation in the world, rather than making grand speeches and advocating power politics, it is better to despise force and not use it, and to choose a policy of peace. Even when it is absolutely necessary to resort to military force, its actions should be open and aboveboard, and not be suspected by others. Thinking of this, I feel that my Minister of the Army's saying that "actions are in accordance with God's will" still needs to be calmly considered and should not be said lightly. Regarding the Manchurian and Mongolian problem, the ideas of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military authorities were fundamentally different. Therefore, there were two diametrically opposed ideologies regarding the League of Nations: respect and contempt. As a result, the Manchurian Incident suddenly broke out, not only failing to utilize the League of Nations but also putting Japan in a seriously disadvantageous position.</p>
<p>The Shidehara-style diplomacy took the principle of denying military force and international coordination, and the result was naturally respecting the League of Nations. This goes without saying. Since the League of Nations came into being, Japan has been a faithful supporter. When Shidehara took his place in foreign affairs, its color became even more pronounced. Shidehara's diplomacy was quite able to rely on the League of Nations to restrain the United States, repeatedly gaining advantages in diplomacy. Why, when the Manchurian Incident occurred, did the whole world turn into enemies? On the one hand, the diplomatic authorities were not adequately prepared, but the military authorities' contempt for the League of Nations was also a major reason. The League of Nations denied war and promoted the principle of substituting law for force. However, our military authorities regarded justice, humanity, and peace as deceptive masks and had to advocate the omnipotence of military force. Its conflict with the League of Nations and its transformation into contempt for the League of Nations were naturally expected and not at all surprising.</p>
<p>Because of contempt for the League of Nations, there was naturally a tendency to despise the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Contempt for the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact resulted in two phenomena. First, it was said that the sanctions were weak and not to be feared, and the condemnation of international public opinion was not worth half a penny. If absolutely necessary, withdrawing from the League of Nations would be acceptable. This kind of childish view is laughable. In dealing with the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, we feel extremely difficult. The course of the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents is like a clear warning. The military authorities are in the line of fire. How can they not be aware of this? However, they are just putting on a bold front to deceive themselves. Second, as a result of contempt for the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, a strong opinion was created, that is, when resolving the Manchurian and Mongolian problem, all third-party interference should be rejected. Any peaceful settlement methods for disputes under the League of Nations regulations should be avoided and not accepted.</p>
<p>All international treaties that are considered to have legal nature, for example, Japan said that China abandoned its treaty obligations, then it is a dispute over the interpretation of the provisions of the existing treaty. According to Article 13 of the League of Nations Covenant, it should be submitted to arbitration or judicial trial for resolution. This is the norm of modern international politics. For this reason, Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, the so-called obligation to respond to litigation, must be accepted by the member states of the League, and they should join the protocol adopted by the ninth General Assembly of the League of Nations in 1928 in order to express their enthusiasm for peaceful settlement of international disputes. The obligation to respond to litigation has been accepted by more than 30 countries. Among the permanent member states, only Japan has not accepted it. As for the protocol, starting with Britain and France, most other countries have joined it, but our country has not yet expressed its intention to join. What is the reason? In fact, some politicians and soldiers strongly advocate that the rights and interests of Manchuria and Mongolia were obtained from a war that gambled on the fate of the country and are of great importance to the survival of the country. In the event of a dispute, it is absolutely impossible to listen to the arbitration of a third party. Although the diplomatic authorities have repeatedly tried to persuade them, they have never been willing to change their old ways.</p>
<p>Supporting the rights and interests of Manchuria and Mongolia and rejecting the arbitration of a third party, this kind of opinion cannot be said to be completely unreasonable. Recalling more than 20 years ago, my government, because of the old concession land tax issue, had a very good chance of winning the case, and filed a lawsuit with the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The result was contrary to expectations and completely lost the case. Now, this matter is cited again, saying that the Manchurian and Mongolian problem, if handed over to arbitration or judicial trial, will also definitely be unfavorable to Japan. However, I do not think so. Why? The current permanent international judicial organs have reached a stage of complete development and can be trusted. We should not be suspicious. However, if the parallel railway problem of the South Manchurian Railway is caused by the Sino-Japanese secret agreement (Translator's note: According to the announcement of our government, there is no such secret agreement), and the Chinese side claims that it is an error of the times and cannot be applied, and requests the League of Nations to review it, our country will inevitably suffer from the difficulty of debate. Also, regarding the right to station troops along the South Manchurian Railway, the Soviet Union had already given it up. Our country insisted on resisting it to the end. What kind of reason can we present in a public court? Judging from these issues, it is no wonder that I have a desire to reject third-party arbitration or interference. However, Japan's harboring evil intentions towards China, and fearing that this will allow people to see its hidden secrets, is the real crux of why our country has always been hesitant and unwilling to move forward on the issue of international justice. However, the peaceful resolution of international disputes has become a trend in the world. Is it fortunate for our Japan to resist it alone? Therefore, it is better to accept the obligation to respond to litigation and join the protocol with appropriate reservations, which is more beneficial than harmful. This is what my wise military authorities should consider.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Visits Yan</h3>
<p>Exchanging Views on the Current Situation</p>
<p>Immediately Returning to Hankou to Report to Chiang</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Zhang Qun, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, came to Taiyuan with Jin Chairman Xu Yongchang yesterday after completing his work in Beiping. He is staying at the Shanxi Hotel. The military and political dignitaries of Jin Province welcomed him at the station. In the evening, Yan Xishan visited Zhang twice at the hotel, and they had a long and pleasant conversation. That night, Yan hosted a banquet at the hotel to welcome Zhang. Zhao Daiwen, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Yang Ai'yuan, Sun Chu, and others were present as guests. The hosts and guests were extremely harmonious. This afternoon (the 5th), Xu Yongchang, in the name of the provincial government, also held a public banquet at the hotel. More than 40 people from the military and political circles were invited. In the evening, Zhao, Xu, Fu, and Jia Jingde, in their personal capacity, hosted a dinner party at Jia's residence. Zhang is scheduled to visit Jinci tomorrow and will have another meeting with Yan tomorrow evening. The day after tomorrow, he will take the Zhengtai train to leave Taiyuan and head south to Hankou to report to Chiang. Zhang's visit seems to have an important mission regarding the current situation. According to Zhang's speech in Taiyuan, he said: "I (Zhang referring to himself) had planned this visit to Taiyuan when I went north. Now that the affairs in Beiping are over, I have come to visit Mr. Yan to renew old friendships and exchange views on the current situation so that I can report to the Central Government and Mr. Chiang after returning south. Mr. Yan has a wealth of experience in politics, military affairs, and academics. At this time of national crisis, I am willing to do my best to assist the Central Government and Mr. Chiang in jointly taking responsibility for saving the country. As for how to implement the entire anti-Japanese plan, Mr. Yan will follow the orders of the Central Government. In addition, I also intend to take this opportunity to study the local conditions in Jin Province, but the stay will only be one or two days, and I am afraid that I will not be able to conduct on-site investigations. As for Beiping, it has been very stable since the establishment of the Military Affairs Commission branch. The generals in North China will continue to work hard and implement the declaration of the Political Committee plenary session of the previous month from beginning to end. Mr. Zhang Xueliang plans to visit Chiang in Hankou in the near future, but the date has not been set. I plan to go to Shijiazhuang the day after tomorrow to transfer trains and go south. If there is a chance to come again in the future, I would like to stay here for a few more days to learn from all parties." (September 5th)</p>

<p>[P Songjiang</p>
<p>Record of the Nine-County Joint Defense Conference: The fourth Nine-County Joint Defense Conference was held in this county. On the morning of the 9th, representatives from various counties arrived in Songjiang successively. The meeting began at 1:00 PM, attended by Shen Yong from Songjiang County, Cheng Ruji from Kunshan County, Wang Zhengcheng from Wujiang, Zhang Pengzhu from Wujin, representative Wu Hanjin from Yixing, Tu Kaixing from Jinshan, Yu Ding from Qingpu, Zou Jing from Wu County, Chen Chuande from Wuxi, representative Chen Qishu from the Yongjing District, Shen Jing from the Songjiang Public Security Bureau, Chen Rongchu from the Police Team, and chaired by Shen Yong. Matters discussed included: (1) Shen Yong proposed that the previous meeting resolved to conduct a review of household registration, which had been submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval. However, the review of household registration involved complex procedures, and the situations in various counties were similar. Therefore, detailed rules were drafted to ensure consistency and facilitate implementation. Whether this was appropriate was put to a vote. The rules were approved and reported to the Department of Civil Affairs for record and implementation. (2) Yu Ding proposed whether to hold a regular joint suppression campaign as the winter defense season approached to ensure the safety of the people. It was resolved to pass the proposal, and the Joint Defense Office would determine a date and notify the counties to hold a joint suppression campaign. (3) Wang Zhengcheng and Zhang Pengzhu proposed whether each county should establish a district defense committee to facilitate progress since the Provincial Security and Defense Committee had already been established. It was resolved to submit a request to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval and to issue a notice to all counties for compliance. (4) It was decided that the fifth meeting would be held in Wuxi on October 14th. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Notorious Bandit Qi Achang Arrested and Escorted to Songjiang: Caohjing and Shanyang in Punan are close to the coast, making it an area where bandits frequently appear. Recently, many robbery cases have occurred. For example, in the Mengjiawei case, Wu Dequan's family was robbed and injured, and the head of the household, Wu Zhu's mother, died from her injuries. Wu Chengdu, the captain of the Second Detachment of the Shanyang County Police, recently learned that Qi Achang, the ringleader of the Qi family gang, a fierce bandit who had previously been wanted by Captain Cao but not apprehended, had secretly returned to his hometown and was committing robberies everywhere. The detachment leader disguised himself the night before last and led police to arrest Qi at Liu Fuyuan's house, and also apprehended a fellow thief, Huang Fugen. After bringing them back for interrogation, they confessed to their crimes. They were escorted to the county government today (the 9th) for further processing.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Reprimanded for Ineffective Tax Collection: The county has accumulated over 200,000 yuan in overdue land taxes for consecutive years. To address this, the provincial government appointed Hong Benli, Liu Gonghe, and five others to Changshu to thoroughly clear the arrears. However, the county has suffered from repeated floods and war disasters in recent years, leading to a decline in social and economic conditions. Although the tax collection committee has deployed soldiers from the Provincial Security Team, accompanied by political police and grain officials, to collect taxes from each household, the results have been minimal. Since February, only over 50,000 yuan has been collected, less than a quarter of the total amount due. As a result, the committee suspects the county magistrate of negligence and of protecting local interests, and has repeatedly petitioned the provincial authorities. On the 7th, the provincial government issued a special reprimand to the county magistrate, Tan Yigui, stating that clearing land taxes was an integral part of the provincial government's plan, and that the county magistrate should assist the committee in strictly collecting taxes and should not make excuses or deliberately obstruct the process. The committee reported that the county magistrate had stated that he could not be responsible for deploying security team soldiers to pursue tax payments, and that only two of the many delinquent taxpayers had been detained, which suggested negligence. The magistrate was instructed to make every effort to assist the committee in collecting taxes as much as possible and to avoid delays.</p>
<p>Chief of the Third Water Police District Arrives in Changshu to Raise Funds: The Thirteenth Water Police Squad of Changshu has been in arrears of pay for seven months, leaving the officers and soldiers with no means to buy food. Squad Leader Yang Qingjiu even sold his own steamboat to maintain their meals. In response, Shen Weiyang, the chief of the Third Water Police District, arrived in Changshu yesterday to discuss fundraising measures with the county government. However, due to the county treasury being empty, no solution could be found, and he left disappointed. He then summoned all the officers and soldiers of the Thirteenth Squad for a speech, explaining the difficulties of the pay arrears and expressing hope that they would endure the hardship and practice self-reliance. He also conducted an inspection of their drills. In the evening, the county magistrate hosted a dinner for him. The district chief returned to Suzhou the next day.</p>
<p>New Director of Education Bureau Has No Definite Arrival Date: Since Zhou Fengjing took over as the director of the Education Bureau of this county, he found the situation difficult to manage in less than two months and requested to resign and leave Changshu, which was approved. Yu Cheng from Jiangyin was appointed to succeed him, but many days have passed, and the new director has not arrived. According to news from Jiangyin, Director Yu went to the provincial capital to thank the committee and receive training, but has not yet returned to Jiangyin. There is no definite date for him to take over the position in Changshu. It is said that the reason for his delay is the deep divisions among the educational circles in Changshu, as well as the arrears of teachers' salaries, which have reached seven months. If the new director arrives with no funds available, it will be difficult to appease the education community. Moreover, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and schools are hoping that the new director will promptly issue salaries so that they can celebrate the festival. Given these difficulties, he has been hesitant to take office easily. Efforts are being made to find funds through contacts in the Finance Bureau, hoping to issue one term's worth of salaries after taking office to maintain the situation. However, according to the Finance Bureau, while education funding is important, it is extremely difficult to raise funds, and they can only guarantee half a term's worth. Since Changshu needs over 24,000 yuan per month for education, not including the expenses of the bureau and social education institutions, it will be difficult for the new Director Yu to arrive before the festival.</p>
<p>Prisoners Causing Trouble Transferred to Suzhou: The County Government of this county previously received an order from the High Court to transfer fifty Kunshan prisoners to Changshu. However, these prisoners are deeply corrupted and frequently cause trouble in prison, including coercing fellow inmates to go on hunger strikes. Seeing this situation, the county government and local individuals feared that it would not only disrupt prison administration but also lead to unexpected incidents, and repeatedly petitioned the High Court to transfer the prisoners elsewhere. Yesterday (the 7th), the county government received an order from the High Court approving the transfer of these prisoners to the Suzhou Temporary Criminal Detention Center. After receiving the order, the county government immediately ordered the prison officials to present the forty-six remaining prisoners (excluding the four who died in prison due to illness), and dispatched a large number of political police and armed police from the Public Security Bureau to escort them on a Suzhou-bound ship that same day for transfer to the High Court.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Dispute Over the Operation of the Kunxing Steamboat: In July of this year, the Kunxing steamboat began operating between Kunshan and Taicang, holding Kunshan County Construction Bureau’s Operation Certificate No. 60. It made four round trips daily, its route matching those of Guangli, Yu Da, and Louqin companies’ boats. Due to the narrowness of the boat’s body and the lack of tugboats, the boat’s speed was significant, and the fares were cheap, resulting in thriving business. Recently, Mao Tigan, the district chief of the Eighth District of Taicang County, and the township head of that district petitioned the county government, claiming that the current autumn tide was high and that over 10,000 mu of farmland in Shuangfeng were low-lying and entirely dependent on the dikes on both sides. The boat’s passage caused waves to splash everywhere, greatly impeding the farmland. The Guangli, Yu Da, and Louqin companies also launched negotiations, claiming that the boat had not complied with the Jiangsu Province Inland River Small Steamboat Regulation Ordinance and the Jiangsu Province Construction Department’s Provisional Method for Issuing Inland River Steamboat Operation Certificates, and that its timing conflicted with that of other boats. According to insiders, the content of this case is very complex, and a solution may not be reached quickly.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Recovering Misappropriated Funds from the Former Director of the Education Bureau: After the change of director in the Wu County Education Bureau, Director Wu (previous) reported to the Department of Education that 20,160 yuan were used for graded increases in teacher salaries in the 20th year, and over 19,000 yuan were spent on establishing six central elementary schools, totaling more than 39,000 yuan. Yesterday, the County Government received instructions from the Department of Education stating that the former Director Wu had not only invented pretexts and excessively misappropriated funds, but also made redundant and duplicated expenditures for school-level increases in the county, as if all the educational expenses of the county were his personal property to be dispensed at will, which was extremely reckless. Under such circumstances, the budget would lose its effectiveness. All the funds misappropriated by the former director must be recovered to uphold public funds.</p>
<p>Anti-Drug Association Reports a Large Number of Opium Traffickers: The monopoly on the sale of opium smoking cessation drugs in Wu County was contracted by twelve opium traffickers, who paid a deposit of 20,000 yuan and committed to sell 15,000 taels per month. The first batch of 5,000 taels had already been transported to Suzhou, but the Anti-Drug Association sent a special letter to the District Prosecutor’s Office to report eight opium traffickers. Chief Prosecutor Xu immediately appointed a prosecutor to conduct a secret investigation and arrest, causing panic in various opium dens in the city, which closed down one after another. However, most of the opium traffickers had already heard the news and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Court Investigates Opium Case in Dongshan: The Dongshan (East Mountain) Area Defense Corps in Suzhou interfered with Public Security Branch Officer Li Xiuyi's arrest of opium dealers and seized the opium dealers. Huang Yiqing, a citizen of the township, filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office requesting an investigation according to the law. After approving the complaint, the District Prosecutor's Office summoned Officer Li Xiuyi, Defense Corps Commander Ju Tingyang, Deputy Commander Dong Baoluo, and witnesses Liu Fusheng and Zou Baonan, water police officers, yesterday for a court hearing. As a result of the interrogation, Ju Tingyang and Dong Baoluo were released on bail, and Li Xiuyi was suspected of accepting illicit payments and was released on 100 yuan cash bail pending further questioning.</p>
<p>Key Suspect in Robbery of Steamboat Arrested: Xu Fengshan, the leader of the detective team of the Suzhou-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Headquarters, received a tip that Chen Jigen, a key suspect in the robbery of a steamboat, was hiding in the Shanghai Concession. Detective Xu personally went to Shanghai and arrested the suspect, who was taken to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Suzhou for interrogation. In the morning of the 8th, the suspect was interrogated by the military law section. The suspect confessed that he was 34 years old and from Wuxi, but denied being involved in the steamboat robbery. He is currently being interrogated.</p>
<p>Rectification of Police Affairs in Jiangsu Province: The funds for the Wu County land and water public security are heavily in arrears. The land public security has not been paid for four months, and the water public security (Third District) has not been paid for seven months. The provincial funds allocated to Wu Jiang and Changshu counties have no funds to allocate. In view of this, County Magistrate Zou went to the provincial capital the day before yesterday to request assistance from the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance. The department replied that the arrears of land and water police salaries were not limited to Wu County; the arrears throughout the province amounted to about 3 million yuan. They were planning to comprehensively rectify the water and land police affairs throughout the province, eliminating the weak and retaining the strong, and cutting redundant branches. They were currently raising funds before deciding on a plan. They instructed Wu County to try to overcome the difficulties, and the issue would be resolved in the shortest possible time. County Magistrate Zou returned to Suzhou on the evening of the 7th, and it was learned that Shen, the chief of the Third Water Public Security District, had also gone to Changshu County to request the Finance Bureau to quickly allocate the provincial funds for the police salary, but there were no good results.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Department Appoints Investigator for Assault Case Involving Public Official: On the 25th of last month, Zhao Yuting, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, was beaten and injured by out-of-town people at the Merchants' Hotel. The main perpetrators have not yet been identified. After the Provincial Government Department of Civil Affairs received a report from County Magistrate Ma, Chairman Gu ordered a strict investigation to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice. After the details of Chief Inspector Zhao's assault were published in detail in the Capital Central Daily News on the 4th of this month, the central military and political authorities also paid close attention to it. Yesterday (the 7th), the Department of Civil Affairs again appointed Li Jinglian to come to Cheng investigate. That night, he went to the Merchants' Hotel to inquire about the circumstances of the incident. According to the room service attendant, the beating occurred on the street, and the perpetrators spoke with an out-of-town accent. The commissioner returned to the province today (the 8th) to report.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Military Police Investigate Secret Transport of Arms and Ammunition by Bandits: Bandits are rampant in the eastern townships of Tong County, and County Magistrate Zhang is leading a team to suppress them. Fearing that the arms would be seized by the government forces, the bandits secretly transported them elsewhere, and many cases have been uncovered. The military police agencies, considering that this county is a key gateway for all counties north of the Yangtze River, and that bandits often smuggle arms and ammunition, decided to strictly investigate and inspect all ports in Jianghai.</p>
<p>Famine Victims Rush to Seize Wheat: The county government allocated wheat for work relief to dredge the Jiangchuan River in Jinghua District. However, the famine victims there gathered and robbed the wheat. The county government held Shen Siming, the person in charge of safekeeping, responsible for negligence and ordered him to compensate.</p>
<p>Court Dispatches Police to Investigate Opium Traffickers: After the public transport of opium in Tong County, the opium was transported in batches, causing public outrage. The Nantong County Court Prosecutor's Office has dispatched police to arrest the key opium traffickers. If any public officials are found to be protecting them, they will also be arrested at any time, and the public is allowed to report them.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Issuance of Battle Zone Relief Vouchers in Lieu of Cash: The Battle Zone Relief Committee of Jiangsu Province, after being approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee, allocated 1 million yuan in pledge vouchers. 345,000 yuan have already been directly collected from the Provincial Government and are being used as pledges. As the need for funds is urgent, the Provincial Government ordered the Department of Finance to allocate the remaining 655,000 yuan to various counties in Jiangnan to be used as pledges for cash. The Department of Finance has drafted the allocation for each county and ordered them to report to the department for transfer. Wuxi's allocation is 69,000 yuan. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the department ordering that personnel be dispatched immediately with official seals to the department to collect the vouchers so that they can be actively implemented without any delay.</p>
<p>Tongyi Cocoon Firm Robbed and Shut Down: Tongyi Cocoon Firm, located near Chang'an Bridge in the Sixth District (Tianxiashi) of the county, is currently opening to collect cocoons as the new cocoons are entering the market. After only two days of weighing, at 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, four bandits suddenly entered the accounting room with pistols and robbed more than 400 yuan in cash and banknotes before leaving. A worker at the firm secretly exited through the back door and ran to inform the Xiyangqiao Defense Corps, who dispatched many members to pursue the bandits. The Bashiqiao Business Corps also heard the alarm and started a search, and the villagers also gathered upon hearing the news. At that time, a villager from Daduntou saw two bandits fleeing in a panic, and one of the bandits scattered 30-40 yuan of the stolen silver on the ground. The villagers were distracted by picking up the money, allowing the bandits to escape. One bandit was arrested in Huaxiang, and a pistol was found on him. He was immediately taken to the city for interrogation.</p>
<p>Industry Conferences on Business Tax: The County Chamber of Commerce convened a temporary meeting of various industries yesterday to discuss the business tax issue. More than 70 people from more than 50 industries attended, and Xia Zhenlong, the director of the Business Tax Bureau, also attended. The meeting proceeded as follows: (1) Qian Sunqing and Cheng Jingtang, the Chamber of Commerce representatives attending the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation General Assembly, reported on the proceedings of the provincial conference. (2) Director Xia of the Business Tax Bureau expressed his intentions, hoping that each industry would truthfully declare their income, considering both sides and avoiding bias. If there were any difficulties, they could openly discuss and negotiate. The final decision was to wait for the provincial authorities to investigate the methods in Zhejiang Province before making a final determination. At the same time, a committee was elected to assist the Business Tax Bureau in handling all matters.</p>
<p>Autumn Cocoon Firms Are Crowded with Goods: As of yesterday, 64 firms from the surrounding villages have opened for autumn cocoon collection. The collection has been crowded in recent days. The most productive has been the Renchang Cocoon Firm in Luoshe, which has collected more than 80 loads of fresh cocoons. The highest price for cocoons has been offered by the Yiyuan Cocoon Firm in Luoshe, which is paying 48.5 yuan per load. Yingyi, Yongkang, Changganglingji, Yanqiao Guangcheng, Zhonghe, Xingchang of Gu Ting Temple, Yongtai of Sizitou, and Hechun of Zhang Village, among other cocoon firms in the Fifth District (Tianxiashi), have collected varying amounts of goods, ranging from more than 70 loads to 20-30 loads. The price of cocoons has been as high as 50 yuan. However, the Huimin and Dali City Xinda cocoon firms in Huixiang, due to the factory's emphasis on austerity, are still paying only 40 yuan and have collected only a dozen or so loads. When the Cocoon Industry Association of this county hosted a banquet for Shanghai and Wuxi silk cocoon merchants the day before yesterday, they discussed the cocoon collection methods and decided to strictly prohibit speculators from setting up firms to collect cocoons with high-priced loans, to protect the interests of farmers. Yesterday, the Cocoon Industry Association submitted a request to the county government to issue a strict prohibition.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Transfers Patrol Officers: After Wu Yi newly appointed Public Security Bureau Chief You Zhenji took office, he transferred Qin Dakun, a patrol officer from the Second Police Station of the First Branch Bureau in Dongmen, to the Xixiashu Police Station yesterday (the 8th) morning. The original Xixiashu patrol officer was transferred to the Butou Ninth Branch Bureau, the original Ninth Branch Bureau patrol officer Xie Rong was transferred to the Seventh Branch Bureau, and the original Seventh Branch Bureau patrol officer Zhuang Ruinian was transferred to the Dongmen First Branch Bureau.</p>

<p>Uncle Rapes Niece: Leng Xianzhang, a resident of Dongmen Street, is approaching forty years old. He usually makes a living selling fried dough twists. His wife is deceased and he only has one daughter named Lian Dizi, who is fourteen years old and can be called a young beauty. Father and daughter depend on each other and get along well. The other day, Leng's brother-in-law Cao Xuelin came to Leng's house to visit relatives. Since it was late, he stayed overnight at the house. Leng went out in the evening to work as a hawker, and Lian Dizi accompanied Cao to chat at home while waiting for her father to return. Unexpectedly, at midnight, Cao saw that Lian Dizi was already aware of things between a man and a woman. Forgetting all moral principles, a bestial thought arose in him. He began by teasing her with sweet words. When he saw that Lian Dizi did not agree, he finally used force at night. Lian Dizi was young and weak, and although she resisted with all her might, she could not overcome him and was eventually raped by Cao. When her father returned, the girl told him the truth. Cao prevaricated, and an argument ensued. Both sides resorted to violence. Neighbors, seeing the situation, felt indignant and informed the police on duty, who took them both to the Second Branch Bureau. After a preliminary interrogation by Branch Chief Zhang, the case was deemed criminal and immediately transferred to the court. After the prosecutor's office held a hearing, it ordered Cao to be detained pending investigation and legal action.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Bank Alarm Causes a False Alarm: Since the Central Bank robbery that occurred in broad daylight, all banks have installed dedicated alarms connected to the First Branch Bureau of Public Security as a precaution. It was prearranged that if they encountered bandits again, they would press the alarm, and the Public Security Bureau would immediately dispatch a team to surround and arrest them, to prevent any bandits from escaping. Unexpectedly, at 11:30 this morning, the alarm suddenly rang at the First Branch Bureau. Suspecting it was bandits, they urgently ordered the team to assemble and telephoned each sub-station, sending police to surround and arrest them in three directions around Zuowei Street. For a time, traffic on the east and west streets and at the entrances of various alleys was completely cut off. As a result, nothing was found. They then went to the various banks to inquire, and were told that there was no bandit alert and no one had pressed the alarm. A false alarm was declared, and the matter was finally settled.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>The Aftermath of the Destruction of the New Shangyu Newspaper Office: Since the New Shangyu Newspaper Office in this county was destroyed on the 31st of last month by Zhu Dingming, incited by Cao Zhencai, the chairman of the Baiguan Red Cross Branch, who also assaulted the director of the newspaper office, Gu Siyu, and staff member Shen Zhenfu, after the newspaper office sued the county and requested their arrest, unexpectedly at about 9 PM on the 4th, Cao Zhencai's son Cao Zhong'an and Zhu Dingming, etc., plotted to sneak into Gu Siyu's house, grabbed Gu, and beat and humiliated him. Afterwards, his family came out to intervene, and Gu took the opportunity to break free. The next afternoon, Gu again filed a lawsuit with the county. Wary of what happened before, he requested the Baiguan Public Security Bureau to send four police officers to escort his sedan chair. While traveling to Yinling Pavilion, unexpectedly Cao Zhong'an, Zhu Dingming, and more than a dozen unemployed vagrants who were lying in ambush, intercepted Gu's sedan when they saw it arriving. They slapped and kicked him, and Cao Zhong'an forced him to write a "correction regarding the Red Cross Branch City Hospital's news about people dying from the epidemic and an apology that the assault and destruction of the newspaper office was not incited by Cao Zhencai and was carried out by Zhu Dingming." At that time, the escorting police officers were powerless to resist. Under violent duress, Gu bowed his head and followed Cao Zhong'an's dictation, writing it down before being released back to the city. On the 6th, he reported it to the county for investigation. Upon receiving the report, the county government immediately ordered the bailiffs to arrest them. That evening, Cao Zhong'an and Zhu Dingming secretly came to the county to inquire about news and were spotted by the bailiffs, who arrested them. After a brief interrogation by Examining Officer Zhu, he ordered them to be detained. On the 7th, he also issued a warrant summoning Cao Zhencai for a joint investigation. Two Kidnappings Occur in the City and Countryside: Chen Qinghai, the son of Chen Lieshan, who runs a rice shop in Mengzha Bridge, outside the East Gate of this county, was having dinner in the shop at 7:30 PM on the 7th when he was suddenly broken in on by three bandits disguised as workers with a Shengxian accent, who kidnapped him. Qinghai's wife, Huang, hearing the noise, came out to see and mistakenly thought it was her husband arguing with someone. She went forward to mediate, but when she saw the bandit pull out a pistol, she shouted for help. Xu Nanrong, a partner at the Wanshun Rice Shop in that area, was alerted and went to give chase. By then, the hostage had already been taken by the three bandits for about half a kilometer. Xu tried his best to catch up, but the bandits threatened Xu with a gun. Xu was terrified and retreated, reporting to the Public Security Bureau and the county defense team. By the time the military and police arrived, the bandits had already gone far away. Since the incident, the whole city has been shocked, believing that with the military and police guarding the city, this kidnapping was not only audacious on the part of the bandits but also due to a lack of thoroughness in the usual precautions. Also, Chen Zhulao's home in Zhangjiatian Village, in the southern countryside, was broken into at night the other day by more than a dozen bandits wielding sharp weapons, who kidnapped Zhulao to Siming Mountain and left a letter demanding a ransom of five thousand yuan, to be delivered at a certain temple in Beizhuang, and so on.</p>

His second son, Yanxing, only eight years old, enrolled in the first grade of the Fourth Middle School Elementary School the other day. Unexpectedly, at 2 PM yesterday, as the cook was drawing water from the well in the courtyard, the student ran past in a hurry, lost his footing, and fell into the well. A certain teacher from the school jumped into the well and rescued him, and he was immediately taken to the Central Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died.</p>

<h3>President Wang Still Has No Date to Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Tang Youren Came to Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Urge His Return</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Wang Jingwei, a member of the Central Executive Committee, came to Shanghai for medical treatment this time and will need quite some time. Fearing that the central government's affairs would be stalled, he previously telegraphed Ye Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Standing Committee, to act as chairman of the Central Political Council. At that time, Secretary-General Ye was in mourning for his beloved daughter and was in a state of grief. He telegraphed back to decline. Wang then telegraphed Gu Mengyu, a member of the Central Committee and Minister of Railways, to act as his deputy. Gu, at the regular meeting of the Central Political Council on the 7th, read Wang's telegram but no decision was made. The Secretariat of the Central Political Council, wondering who to consult for instructions on important cases during Wang's absence from Nanjing, did not know what to do and submitted this issue to the Central Standing Committee for discussion on the 8th. Those present believed that Wang's illness would be cured soon and that there was no need for a deputy in fact. They decided to send Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, to Shanghai to urge Wang to return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over everything. Tang arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Nanjing yesterday morning and immediately returned to his residence to rest. In the afternoon, he went by car to Pushi Road to visit Wang, but Wang had already gone out for medical treatment and they did not meet. In the evening, Tang visited Wang again and conveyed the Central Government's hope that Wang would return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over government affairs. The reporter visited Tang at his residence yesterday and asked about Wang's condition and the date of his return to Nanjing. According to Tang, Wang took the opportunity to come to Shanghai for treatment of diabetes because the political affairs were relatively relaxed at this time. He is currently undergoing examinations and treatment at both the Nuoer Hospital and the Huangyun Hospital, and will not be able to leave Shanghai to return to Nanjing in the next few days. As for the rumors that Wang is being passive, they are absolutely untrue. The date of my return to Nanjing has not been determined.</p>

<h3>The Philippine Tobacco Merchants Association Donates $4,000 to General Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>Entrusted to the Relief Association for Forwarding</p>
<p>The Philippine Chinese Tobacco Merchants Association sent a letter to Zhu Qinglan yesterday and remitted $4,000 in Shanghai silver via the China Xingye Bank, requesting that it be forwarded to Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, for military supplies for the war of resistance against Japan. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>To Zhu Qinglan: Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, Mr. Qinglan, The Japanese bandits are invading, and the Northeast has fallen. In an instant, almost a year has passed. Not only has the bloodshed in Shanghai not dried and the humiliation not been avenged, but the situation in Rehe is becoming increasingly serious. The Japanese bandits are like wolves and tigers, which is heartbreaking. Fortunately, General Ma Zhanshan and the Northeast Volunteer Army, based on the principle of defending the territory, are fighting to the death. Their indomitable spirit is admired far and wide. We respectfully remit $4,000 in national currency through the China Xingye Bank for the purpose of rewarding the troops. Please accept it and forward it. Your kindness will be greatly appreciated. Respectfully wishing you well, The Philippine Tobacco Merchants Association.</p>
<p>To Ma Zhanshan: Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, Zhu Qinglan, forwarding to General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province and all officers and soldiers of the Northeast Volunteer Army, Since the Japanese bandits invaded in the past, using their wild ambition to nibble away and swallow like whales, forcibly occupying Liaoning and Jilin, and attacking Jinzhou, now they are advancing into Rehe, attempting to plunder Pingjin. Their power is so strong that it seems unstoppable. Seeing the mountains and rivers broken and the map changing color, this national crisis is infuriating. Fortunately, you are leading the Northeast Volunteer Army to bravely kill the enemy, fighting for the country's survival and for the nation's dignity. Hearing the good news from afar, we deeply admire you. We hope that you will continue your efforts, take advantage of the remaining power of victory, and annihilate the Japanese bandits in order to achieve the goal of recovering lost territory. Although overseas Chinese live far away in foreign lands, they must do their part and pledge to be your rear guard. We respectfully remit $4,000 in national currency through Mr. Zhu Qinglan of the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association as a reward for your army and all the volunteer armies, to express our humble intentions. Please accept it and await a reply. Wishing you well, The Philippine Tobacco Merchants Association.</p>

<h3>Official Burial in Hubei for Tian Tong’s Coffin After Its Return</h3>
<p>Arriving in Hankou by Jianghua Steamer on the 13th</p>
<p>The Hubei Provincial Government has selected the 20th of this month for the public burial of Kuomintang elder Mr. Tian Ziqin, and resolved to dispatch a special steamer to Shanghai to receive the coffin. It is heard that after deliberations, the provincial steamers were deemed unsuitable due to either low speed or unfamiliarity with the route. Yesterday, Director He Chengjun separately telegraphed Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director Wu Xingya of Shanghai, and Director Zhang Yanling of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in this city, entrusting them to arrange for the Jianghua steamer to transport the coffin, ensuring expediency. The provincial government also appointed Secretary Zhou Zun as the special commissioner to Shanghai to handle all matters related to receiving the coffin. Yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu, Director Wu, Director Zhang, and Mr. Tian Jiwei and other family members of the deceased Mr. Tian discussed the matter and agreed to move the coffin from the Hubei Guild Hall on Zhizaoju Road in the Nanshi area at 3 PM on the 12th to board the steamer, which would depart the next day. In addition to notifying various organizations and groups to send representatives to pay their respects at the time, the municipal government has reportedly also ordered the mobilization of security troops, a military band, etc., to escort the coffin to the Jiangnan dock, to demonstrate solemnity. The following is a transcription of Director He's telegram to the family of Mr. Tian: To Brother Tian Jiwei, No. 72, Yongyu Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, Shanghai, Greetings. Received your telegram with respect. I have been discussing with the provincial government, headquarters, and shipping companies for days, but due to the ships being too small and unfamiliar with the route, they are unsuitable. The Sanbei Company only has two ships that can transport the coffin, and they cannot arrive in Hankou until around the 15th, which is too rushed. I have no choice but to telegraph Tiecheng, Xingya, and Zhang Yanling in Shanghai, to make arrangements locally, intending to charter the entire middle cabin or select a certain number of units on either the Jianghua or Jiang'an. I have already telegraphed Tiecheng, Xingya, and Zhang Yanling to discuss and decide. This is more reliable in practice, but I am very uneasy that I could not send a special steamer to receive the coffin, which is lacking in solemnity. The provincial government has instructed Secretary Zhou Zun to handle everything. Please give us your instructions. Respectfully, your brother He Chengjun, Yu.</p>
<h3>Recent Progress of Dike Construction in This City</h3>
<p>80% to 90% of the Project Already Completed</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the dike construction in the Gaoqiao area of this city, undertaken by the Public Works Bureau, is largely completed. Recently, rumors of workers stealing materials have caused panic among the residents of the area. A reporter inquired with the Public Works Bureau about this matter. Chief Mo of the Fourth Section of the Bureau explained as follows: The original dikes in the Gaoqiao area were mostly destroyed after last year's flood. To ensure the safety of the residents in the area, the municipal government ordered the Bureau to rebuild them. The Bureau specially assigned the Director of the Dike Construction Section of the Second Division to be stationed in Gaoqiao to supervise the work. All materials are inspected by the Bureau before being used. However, the other day, it was discovered that some wooden piles did not meet the specified dimensions (the wooden piles were supposed to be about 12 feet long). The supervisor immediately ordered the workers to remove and replace them. This led to misunderstandings in the outside world, and a report was made to the Dike Construction Committee. The Committee sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and found no evidence of theft or shortage. The rumors have thus subsided. As for the progress of the dike construction, although it is not yet completed, even with extremely high tides, there will be no accidents.</p>
<p>Another report states that the dike construction in this city has been underway for nearly three months and will soon be completed. According to responsible personnel from the Bureau yesterday, the Gaoqiao seawall in this city suffered damage during the typhoon in late August of last year. The Bureau immediately sent workers to repair it, which was fortunately successful for the time being. However, the dangerous situation was not alleviated. Therefore, after the emergency repairs, the Bureau drafted a thorough repair plan for a permanent solution. While it was being processed, the January 28th Incident unfortunately occurred, and everything came to a standstill. It was not until the establishment of the Dike Construction Rehabilitation Committee in late April of this year, with the advocacy of local figures and the urging of the municipal government, that work could officially begin in mid-June. Even though the municipal treasury was severely depleted after the war, the municipal government still allocated 250,000 yuan for the dike construction expenses. Since the resumption of work, the progress of each section of the project has been very rapid, and 80% to 90% of the overall project has now been completed. It is expected that the entire project can be completed before the deadline. However, the section known as "Xiaer" (遐邇) is taking longer because it was originally a reinforced concrete dike, and the main body of the dike collapsed into the sea during the storm surge last year. This time, it is taking great effort to repair it. Furthermore, the contractor for the section's level piles was found to be using short piles. The dike construction personnel discovered this, and immediately implemented a pile extraction inspection. A six-foot short pile was found, and a report was sent to the Bureau. Director Shen sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and strictly ordered the on-site personnel to supervise the contractor to remove all the wooden piles that had been driven to thoroughly investigate. Due to the above circumstances, the completion of this section of the project may be slightly delayed compared to other sections.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters Test-Fired Artillery Yesterday in Longhua</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters test-fired artillery near the Longhua Airfield yesterday, firing more than ten types of ammunition, including illuminating rounds and smoke rounds of various colors, such as red, white, yellow, and purple. The Headquarters had previously informed residents not to be alarmed and invited people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, to the scene to observe. The ordnance was manufactured in France. If the test results are satisfactory, a number of them will be ordered.</p>
<h3>Water Rates Double</h3>
<p>Huacheng Tobacco Company Requests Negotiation</p>
<p>Taxpayers’ Association Asks Municipal Council to Handle</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers’ Association sent a letter yesterday to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which stated: “We are writing to you concerning a letter from the Shanghai China Huacheng Tobacco Company, which states that the water used by the company's office at No. 476 Ningbo Road and the four residential houses behind it was originally calculated based on rent, with a monthly rent of $71.50. Starting in June of this year, the water company abolished the old regulations, installed water meters, and charged $40 plus change for the second half of June. Unexpectedly, the bill for July was over $130, nearly doubling the previous water bill, which is unbearable. Therefore, the company has temporarily suspended payment of last month's water bill. We are writing to you to investigate and request that you forward the letter to the Municipal Council, consulting with the water company to maintain the old regulations to relieve the burden. This would be a demonstration of public spirit. We have reviewed the increase of one-quarter surcharge from the previous year, regardless of the lack of justification, which has already caused losses to users. Now, the water fee calculated by the water meter has increased drastically, and such a method can increase the water company's profits, but the burden on users is too great. In the opinion of this association, the base price of 62.5 cents per thousand gallons is too expensive. This association hopes that the interests of the company and users will not conflict, so as to achieve fairness. Otherwise, the original intention of a monopolistic public utility will be lost, and the original intention of your bureau in approving this public utility will also be completely lost. Based on the aforementioned circumstances, we are writing to request that your bureau promptly resolve the issue with the water company in a fair and mutually beneficial manner. Respectfully addressed to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council."</p>

<p>Park and Road Projects Also Continue</p>
<p>The current construction status in the city center can be divided into three types: buildings, parks, and roads.

<h3>Workers at Qiuxin Shipyard Went on Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>All Work Stopped Completely</p>
<p>Labor Union Reports to Party and Government Authorities</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, a labor strike broke out at the Shanghai Junying Qiuxin Shipyard due to the dismissal of twelve workers. The Party and government authorities intervened and the workers had initially agreed to return to work. However, the factory suddenly broke its promise, and the Party and government authorities sent personnel to intervene again. The management took a firm stance and refused to mediate, causing great indignation among the workers throughout the factory, so they unanimously went on strike yesterday.</p>
<p>Strike Notice: After the factory refused the mediation of the Party and government authorities, the labor union immediately convened a general membership meeting that evening, resolving to declare a strike starting yesterday. The labor union also issued a strike notice stating: "Notice: As resolved by the extraordinary membership meeting, the factory has repeatedly oppressed workers, violated labor-management contracts, rejected labor union representatives, and dismissed a large number of workers, disregarding the mediation of the Party and government authorities. It is believed that the factory has completely adopted high-handed measures against our workers and has no sincerity in accepting the returning workers and all labor-management cases. All our workers have no choice but to take the final measure to urge the factory to realize its error. Starting on the 9th of this month, we will implement a strike. Please comply and implement this notice. To all workers of the Qiuxin Shipyard, issued by the Strike Committee."</p>
<p>Strike Situation: Starting at 7:00 AM yesterday, workers from all departments of the factory, including the fitter shop, lathe shop, coppersmith shop, blacksmith shop, foundry, sheet metal shop, electrical department, welding department, painting department, crane department, carpentry department, and turbine department, went on strike. The factory immediately locked the iron gates of each department and ordered the workers to leave the factory.</p>
<p>Strike Discipline: (1) Workers must absolutely abide by the resolutions of the Strike Committee; (2) Workers must absolutely execute the orders of the Strike Committee; (3) Workers must not return to work without the orders of the Strike Committee; (4) Workers must not collude with the management to undermine the strike; (5) The Strike Committee may use the most effective methods to punish violators of the above disciplines.</p>
<p>Workers' Demands: After the workers declared the strike, they immediately put forward four demands: (1) All dismissed workers must be reinstated; (2) Wages must be paid as usual during the strike; (3) The contract must be revised; (4) Travel expenses must be paid as usual for outside work.</p>
<p>Strike Declaration: The Qiuxin Shipyard has been in operation for more than twenty years, and the relationship between labor and management has always been harmonious. After the establishment of the labor union in the sixteenth year, the lives of our workers have been slightly improved, and all workers have been diligent in their work. Therefore, the relationship between labor and management has become even better with the establishment of the labor union. Since Mr. Maitiroly took over this spring, he has been hostile to the labor union, oppressed workers, and arbitrarily overturned the labor-management contract, so disputes have arisen frequently. Recently, eleven workers from the iron department went to work on Xujiahui Tailasite Road. According to the original factory regulations, workers sent to work outside the factory were paid travel expenses based on the distance, which was allocated by the factory. Unexpectedly, the travel expenses allocated this time were suddenly deducted. Our workers' daily wages are already meager, and they must make up for travel expenses, which affects their livelihood. Therefore, they demanded from the factory that if travel expenses were not paid, the factory should provide vehicles for transportation. Unexpectedly, the factory not only refused to accept it, but also dismissed all twelve workers, which aroused public indignation and caused a labor strike. Our association reported to the Party and government authorities for handling. After the Party and government authorities sent personnel to mediate the other day, the factory agreed to reinstate eight of the dismissed workers, and the remaining four would be further mediated, and the workers were ordered to return to work first. The workers, in consideration of the orders of the Party and government authorities, compromised and reluctantly accepted. Unexpectedly, the factory broke its promise after the workers returned to work and refused to reinstate them, which caused public indignation and forced them to use the workers' last weapon and implement a strike to urge Mr. Maitiroly to realize his error. Since Mr. Mai took over as supervisor this spring, only half a year has passed, and he has caused dozens of disputes of all sizes. He has refused to negotiate with our labor union representatives and has disregarded our Party and government authorities. He has refused to implement the results of each mediation. Therefore, a general strike was launched on the 9th to seek a final victory. We hope that all sectors of society will uphold justice. We would be very grateful. This declaration.</p>
<p>Labor Union Report: Reporting that the factory refused to reinstate workers, inciting a factory-wide strike. Please review and approve, and request to consult with the Public Security Bureau to order protection. The factory of our association, Qiuxin Shipyard, dismissed twelve workers without reason. Previously, we had prepared a document reporting the facts and circumstances to your bureau, and requested mediation to maintain labor. Subsequently, on the 8th, your bureau sent personnel to mediate. The factory agreed to reinstate eight of the dismissed workers, and the remaining four would be further mediated, and the workers were ordered to return to work first. Unexpectedly, the factory broke its promise when the workers returned to work and refused to reinstate them, which caused public indignation, and all the workers in the factory automatically went on strike on the 9th. In addition to ordering all workers to maintain order and wait quietly for a solution, the association has prepared a document to report, and request your review and approval, and request to consult with the Public Security Bureau to order protection. This would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Xu Chongdao Strike</h3>
<p>The Management Agrees to Reinstatement of Six Dismissed Workers</p>
<p>After the Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store experienced a strike, the Municipal Party Department sent personnel to persuade and guide, and four principles were decided. Work resumed the other day. However, the management wanted to dismiss six of the strike leaders, which caused another twist. Now, after further negotiations by the Municipal Party Department, the management has agreed to reinstate them, and the labor strike has been declared resolved.</p>
<p>Agreement to Reinstate: Xu Chongdao's management believes that this strike was initiated by Cen Yongkang and other six people, disrupting business, which was illegal. Therefore, immediately after the reinstatement of the employees, a notice was posted announcing the dismissal of Cen and other six people to deter others. This was opposed by all employees, and the public was extremely angry. They petitioned the Party and government authorities, requesting a stop to it. Li Weixiong from the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Department, together with Zhao Zhenhui and other labor union representatives, went to negotiate with the management and agreed to reinstate Cen Yongkang and other six people immediately. Therefore, this labor strike was resolved.</p>
<p>End of the Strike Committee: All employees of Xu Chongdao declared a strike to support Chen Peiran, and organized a Strike Committee, electing Cen Yongkang and other twenty-three people as strike committee members. Now that the labor strike has been resolved, the Strike Committee has also ended at the same time. If disputes arise in the future, the small group meeting will be responsible for handling them.</p>
<h3>A Portion of Workers at Xiangsheng Factory Caused Trouble Yesterday</h3>
<p>Factory Manager Krekloto Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>Labor Union Representatives Seek Instructions from Party and Government</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, a portion of the workers at the Pudong Xiangsheng Iron Factory suddenly resorted to violence yesterday, causing the factory manager, an Englishman named Krekloto, two Western administrators, and watchman Wang Heshang, and Patrolman No. 14 to be beaten and injured. The factory was unable to operate, so the factory gates were closed in the afternoon. The labor union sent representatives to the Party and government authorities to seek instructions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Dispute: The Pudong Xiangsheng Factory was founded by a British merchant with a capital of over 30 million yuan. It has been in operation for more than eighty years. Other factories, including Hefeng, Dongjiadu, and Yesong Shipyard, are also under the jurisdiction of the factory. There are a total of more than 1,200 workers, so the scale is extremely large, and the business is quite developed. Recently, the factory discovered that 37 workers, including Zhao Fusheng, Shen Liumin, and Liu Gui, had not been working in the factory since April 4th of this year. After sending people to investigate four times, it was not found that the workers were working in the factory. Therefore, the factory issued a notice on the 7th of this month, announcing that Zhao Fusheng and other 37 people would be suspended from duty on the 14th. After the Fifth District Shipbuilding Labor Union learned of this, it convened a meeting of directors and supervisors the night before (the 8th) to discuss the matter. It was resolved to instruct Zhao Fusheng and other 37 people to report the details so that they could negotiate with the company. Sudden Use of Force: At 9:00 AM yesterday, the workers Zhao Fusheng and other 37 people suddenly turned off the factory's electric motors and used iron machines as weapons. The factory manager, an Englishman named Krekloto, two Western administrators, watchman Wang Heshang, and Patrolman No. 14 were beaten and injured. After receiving the report, the Third District Public Security Bureau immediately sent armed police to suppress the situation, but the workers took the opportunity to escape. The injured were immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. After the incident, the factory closed its gates at 12:00 noon and announced a temporary suspension of work.</p>
<p>Labor Union Seeks Instructions: After the dispute occurred, the labor union sent Standing Director Zhang Linhua to report the incident to the Municipal Party Department and seek instructions. Wang Manyun, the director of the Civil Training Section, received him and promised to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth before handling the matter. Then, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau, where Wang Gang from the Third Division received them and also promised to investigate with the Party Department before making a decision. At the same time, the labor union notified its members to wait for the Party and government authorities to handle the matter in accordance with the law and sent a letter to the Third District Public Security Bureau requesting that personnel be stationed in the factory to protect the other genuine workers.</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Goods Exported to India Must Be Marked with Nationality</h3>
<p>The Federation of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories recently received a notice from the Ministry of Industry stating that the toothpaste, face powder, bath powder, and other goods produced by the Shanghai Meixing Company were detained by Indian customs. Please forward this case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiation. It was ordered to send a letter to the International Trade Bureau, transferring it to the British Commercial Counselor in Shanghai to inquire about the reason for the detention. It was said that the United Kingdom requires goods imported from other countries to have clear markings indicating the country of manufacture, otherwise they will not be allowed to be imported. This case should be investigated by the local Chinese Consul regarding trademark regulations and then negotiated, which would be more effective. It has been ordered that the Consul General in India investigate and handle it.</p>

It is possible that the bonds will be issued next spring.</p>

<h3>Closing Arguments in You Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 15th</p>
<p>The case of former Shanghai Fifth District Chief You Bolu and others, for the killing and wounding of Cai Yongfang and others, was transferred to the Shanghai District Court for sentencing. You and others appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court. After several hearings and summons of witnesses, most of the family members of the deceased and the injured, with the persuasion and assistance of the Municipal Party Department, were given appropriate compensation by the Municipal Government and initially withdrew their complaints. However, most could not be notified. The Higher Court opened the first hearing at 2:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Presiding Judge Song Yuan, Judges Zhu Zongzhou and Wu Yuheng, and Prosecutor Zhu Tingyao. Presiding Judge Song instructed You Bolu, Qiao Xuechang, Lin Zhanyou, Wu Maolin, Liu Weicheng, Lin Duxiang, and others to provide detailed accounts of what had happened. Presiding Judge Song questioned them one by one on whether the firing was aimed at the sky or level, whether the firing took place inside the compound or at the entrance, and how many people had entered the compound. After providing a copy of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's reply about the types of firearms used in each district for the defendants to review, the prosecutor began to present the case, beginning the closing arguments. The lawyers for You Bolu, Qu Yue, Shen Zhaojiu, and Zhang Yipeng, presented their closing arguments first. Lawyer Qu stated briefly that before the closing arguments in this case, the court should pay special attention to the following points: (A) The case occurred during the aftermath of the September 18th Incident, and the public in Shanghai was extremely angry with Japan; (B) The case was reported by the Party Department, and the Party Department had a certain position. Therefore, the Shanghai District Court specially opened a collegial panel for this case, and dispatched armed police to defend the trial; (C) What kind of responsibilities did the defendants have in their positions at the time; (D) The testimony of witnesses must be sought to be genuine and impartial; (E) The deceased and injured have been compensated by the Municipal Party Department. The above points must be considered first, and then a fair judgment can be sought in this case. The only evidence in this case is the bullets. Those examined in the hospital were different from those used by the police officers. Firing into the sky: the next day of the case (October 2nd), Shanghai newspapers all recorded it. Shi Tifen is a member of the Sixth District Party, and the testimony before and after must be viewed and studied together. Furthermore, Baoshan Road runs in a southwest and northeast direction, while the gate of the Fifth District faces southeast. There is no space to the right inside the gate, and there is an empty courtyard to the left. There is a wall in front of the courtyard, about ten feet high. The dead and wounded were all to the left of the gate, some very far away. If the gun were fired level, it would have to penetrate the wall. Otherwise, there could be no causal connection with the dead and wounded. Lawyer Shen stated briefly that according to the investigation by the Municipal Department, there were those that were not fair. After reading the testimonies, some said that more than ten or dozens of shots were fired. It can be seen that in addition to the eight shots fired by the police officers, there were other guns fired. The use of firearms has its own regulations, and the defendants' firing was in accordance with these regulations. Regardless of whether the dead and wounded are related to the police officers' guns, it is difficult to be held responsible, even if they are related. Please examine all sides and make a judgment in favor of the defendants. Lawyer Zhang stated briefly that in short, the case is about (1) whether the dead and wounded were hit by the gun fired by You, and (2) whether the trajectory of the bullets fired into the sky in the courtyard could reach the location of the dead and wounded. A crowd rushed into the district gate, and the situation was critical, so they had to fire to intimidate them. At that time, the situation in Shanghai was serious, and it was difficult to make a fair judgment. The jurisdiction should be transferred in accordance with the law. Now that the investigation is clear, the defendants should be declared innocent, and the police officers' views should also be handled together. Tao Jiachun, the lawyer for the five defendants including Lin Qingxiang, argued briefly that this lawyer was originally the designated counsel for the first instance. Now, because the original judgment was indeed not appropriate, he is still fulfilling his obligations and maintaining the defense. The second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth defendants should not be punished in accordance with Article 36 of the Criminal Code. According to Article 35 of the "Punishment Law", they should also not be punished. It was also clearly argued that bullets that do not hit and shots fired into the sky cannot bear the criminal responsibility for the dead and wounded. After the public prosecution declared the end of the closing arguments, Presiding Judge Song continued to question Xu Shichang, the lawyer for the private prosecution. The lawyer stated that private prosecution could be brought in accordance with the second instance. Presiding Judge Song stated that it had been mentioned in the first instance but no judgment was made, so it would not be appropriate to proceed with the hearing. Lawyer Xu then retreated. After the clerk read the record, Presiding Judge Song stated that the case was scheduled for sentencing at 1:00 PM on the 15th of this month, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at China Merchants Electric Company Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Workers Oppose Reinstatement of Zhou Guangrong and Others</p>
<p>Letter to Company Requests Prompt Dismissal</p>
<p>The Greater Shanghai General Labor Union stated that since the labor dispute occurred in the First District Water and Electricity Workers' Union of the Nanshi area, the former union directors Zhou Guangrong and five others were expelled from the union and a letter was sent to the company requesting the termination of their positions. The matter has not been resolved for many days. Recently, it was heard that Zhou Guangrong and others had returned to the factory to work, leading to widespread indignation. An emergency board of directors meeting was convened to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Drivers Resign: All the workers of the company, because the former union directors Zhou Guangrong and five others were involved in undermining labor movements, passed a resolution in a meeting to expel them from the union and sent a letter to the company to terminate their employment. Although the company did not announce the dismissal of Zhou and others after their expulsion from the union, Zhou and others ultimately did not dare to come to the factory to work. Therefore, they applied for leave from the company. Now, Zhou and others believe that a long time has passed, so they went to the company a few days ago to cancel their leave and planned to continue working. Unexpectedly, this was discovered by the workers. At that time, more than 30 drivers and workers asked for leave from the company and returned their badges, declaring that if Zhou and others were allowed to be reinstated, the workers would resign en masse, thus leading to a dispute.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: The First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, upon receiving a report that the former Standing Committee member Zhou Guangrong and others had returned to the factory to work, convened an emergency board of directors meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday. Chairman Tan Honglin resolved to send a letter to Lu Bohong, the manager of China Merchants Electric Company, requesting that Zhou and others not be allowed to work before the case is resolved; otherwise, the company will be fully responsible for any labor unrest that occurs.</p>
<p>Letter to the Company: The union sent a letter to China Merchants Electric Company yesterday, which stated: "Dear Manager Lu, our union previously requested your company to immediately terminate the employment of the disruptive elements Zhou Guangrong, Zhu Hanhe, Tang Junsheng, Zhang Ruoyu, Dong Yiwu, and Lu Rongtang. It has been a long time, and we have not seen your company take decisive measures. Today, we received reports from workers that they have seen these individuals working at the factory, and we do not know whether this is tacitly approved by the company. Our union is deeply concerned that the unrest will escalate and lead to unexpected events. Therefore, we are writing to request that your manager continue to suspend their employment until the case is resolved; otherwise, our union will not be responsible for any unfortunate consequences. Respectfully, to Manager Lu of China Merchants Electric Company."</p>
<p>Party Department Investigation: After learning that a labor dispute had occurred at China Merchants Electric Company, the Municipal Party Department, fearing that the situation would escalate, dispatched Dai Yongchan, a cadre from the People's Training Section, to investigate both the labor and management sides and to advise the workers not to allow the situation to escalate.</p>

<h3>Binjiang Red Swastika Society Appeals on Behalf of Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Only Large-Scale Relief Can Achieve Universal Assistance</p>
<p>The Binjiang disaster was unprecedented. When the dikes broke, the Red Swastika Society rescue team immediately dispatched 60 boats to the north and south banks to rescue disaster victims and set up shelters. The cries for help from the disaster victims taking refuge on the roofs were unbearable. Although the society rescued them one by one and provided emergency relief, the disaster area was vast, and it was difficult to reach everyone. Recently, the society sent a special commissioner to Dalian to appeal and issued a general letter appealing to all sectors of society in the country. During this national crisis, reading this tragic and desperate text cannot help but bring tears to one's eyes. The society's general announcement is recorded below for the consideration of benefactors from all walks of life. "Dear Sirs, since the devastating flood on August 7th, the torrential flow was terrifying and soul-stirring. People were terrified and rushed to escape. Upon hearing the news, our society was as furious as if we had been stabbed. We immediately urged the rescue team to set out in different directions and actively provide relief. We prepared four steamers and sixty small boats to shuttle back and forth between the north and south banks of the river, patrolling the streets and cities, and helping all living beings. For five consecutive days and nights, we worked tirelessly. We used vehicles to carry those on land out of danger and to safe places. At the same time, we found suitable locations in Nangan universities and Dongtie warehouses, a total of seven places. By the 12th, we had sheltered more than 27,000 refugees. The number of people who were rescued and left immediately was no less than 30,000. At that time, the area inside and outside Daoli was a vast expanse of water, which had become a swamp. The water depth east of the 16th street in Daowai was more than ten feet, and the west was eight or nine feet or four or five feet. The water level in Xu Wuliu and Liuliu streets in Daoli was slightly lower, and the remaining places were three to five feet shallow and submerged at the deepest. This flood was truly unprecedented. Our association has the great responsibility of providing relief. We worked courageously every day, and we did not complain of hardship. For all refugees, we distributed bread three times a day, and then we set up three porridge factories in Nangan, which can meet the needs of 15,000 people, providing two meals a day, so that the women and children of the refugees can eat without starving to death on the road. Moreover, after the flood, the foul air was pervasive, and the epidemic had already begun, and the disaster victims were even worse. Prevention is more important than cure, and hygiene is the most important. We built 42 toilets in various places, and we also distributed epidemic prevention drugs and sent many doctors to carry out epidemic prevention inspections. If there are patients, they will be treated at any time. A clinic was also set up in front of our association to rescue the disaster victims who have no funds to avoid delaying their lives. By the afternoon of the 12th, the water level gradually receded, and by this morning, it had decreased by six inches. However, since the past few days, the wind and rain have been frequent, and the refugees who are sleeping in the open are in a miserable state. Now that it is autumn and the night is cold and frost is falling, if the resettlement is not properly planned, how can the disaster victims survive? All our colleagues are in the disaster area. Even if we have great ambitions, we can't do what we want. Although many benefactors have enthusiastically donated funds, the amount is still a drop in the bucket. At this time of great disaster, there is immeasurable sinking, and only a large-scale plan can achieve the effect of universal assistance. Therefore, our colleagues are proceeding with difficulty and dare not slack off. Only by relying on the concerted efforts of all associations and joint assistance can we achieve the perfect compassion. In addition to sending separate letters, we should also send a letter to ask for investigation, pay special attention, and hope that Nan will give us advice."</p>
<h3>Provincial Order to Assist in Collecting Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued an order yesterday to the various chambers of commerce of Minhang, Maqiao, Sanlin, etc. in this county, stating: "We have received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating that the current reorganization of business tax in this province was originally intended to be handled seriously to achieve remedial results. According to reports from various bureaus, commercial organizations in various counties are still mostly arbitrarily watching and waiting, and some are even using the excuse that the tax rate is different from the six measures established by the Chamber of Commerce to refuse to declare. The six measures previously submitted by the Chamber of Commerce were originally a kind of resolution behavior, but merchants in various counties have used them to resist the provincial tax rate, which is very unreasonable. Moreover, the business tax revenue is of great importance to the military and police needs of this province. If there are delays and omissions, it will inevitably have a great impact. In addition to ordering the bureaus to handle the matter seriously and not be afraid of difficulties, the county magistrates are responsible for the special responsibility of monitoring and collecting. At the beginning of the reorganization, a truly responsible attitude is needed to impress people. The various commercial organizations must be clearly informed so that there will be no more excuses to watch and wait. Only then can the tax revenue be guaranteed. In order to supervise and urge progress, this office has prepared a document to be submitted to your government for review and approval, and to order all county governments to comply strictly and to strictly order all commercial organizations to comply with the regulations set by the province, which is convenient for the public. This order, in addition to the order and distribution, is ordered to the chamber of commerce to comply strictly."</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs Compiles Food Statistics for the 20th Year</h3>

The total amount of rice arriving throughout the year at the three locations of Hexia Customs, Shanghai Customs, and the railway station is more than 3.6 million yuan, and the sales volume is similar. The number of foreign rice orders is more than 2 million dan, and the number of arrivals exceeds 500,000 dan. The total number of wheat imports throughout the year is more than 18 million dan, and the number of exports is only 560,000 dan. The number of flour imports is more than 1.2 million bags, but the number of exports is more than 24 million bags. The number of bean imports is more than 6 million dan, and the number of exports is only more than 1.7 million dan. The detailed statistics have been oil-printed by the bureau in advance to prepare for the needs of various places.</p>

<h3>Proof Required for Purchasing Goods from Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association yesterday notified its fellow members, stating: "We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which briefly states that from now on, when purchasing goods from the eastern provinces, regardless of wholesale or retail purchase, the merchant should request the local commercial organization to issue a certificate of proof for each batch at the time of transaction, so as to facilitate verification at the place of sale and avoid disputes. With the approval of the above, the Executive Committee held a temporary meeting yesterday to discuss it. It was decided that since there is no chamber of commerce in Dalian, only the Chinese Merchants' Council, which is the nature of a chamber of commerce, should be contacted by this association. In the future, please issue a certificate of proof for each batch of goods shipped out at any time. At the same time, reply to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce that if there is still a need for proof in the future, the Chamber of Commerce should still provide considerable assistance in maintaining the interests of merchants. At the same time, announce to the fellow members that from now on, all purchases of goods from the eastern provinces must be issued by the Chinese Merchants' Council as proof for verification at the place of sale in order to avoid disputes."</p>
<h3>The Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Prevents Arbitrary Tax Increases</h3>
<p>Please Handle According to the Ministry's Approval</p>
<p>The nine industry associations in this city, including the Tobacco Exchange Industry, Liquor Store Industry, Native Yellow Tobacco Industry, Dry Tobacco Industry, Shaoxing Tobacco Industry, Fenjiu Industry, Wine and Dish Restaurant Industry, Soy Sauce Garden Industry, and Liang Shaojiu Industry, jointly stamped and submitted documents to the Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating: "Our industries' businesses are in tobacco and alcohol. For the tobacco and alcohol license tax, we have been paying to the place of donation according to the original license amount at the end of each quarter. Before the 17th year, only two periods were levied each year, and those who paid two yuan only paid four yuan per year. Since the 17th year, it has been changed to four seasons, which is double the tax amount compared to the previous one. The merchants of each industry have been struggling to bear the burden in order to fulfill their duties because of the many national affairs. During the 1/28 incident this year, both Shanghai and Baoshan suffered sudden disasters, and all industries were suspended. Although traffic has gradually recovered since then, the business of merchants in each industry is far from what it was before. We were planning to petition for a reduction in various donations and taxes in order to ease the burden and maintain livelihoods. However, for this year's tobacco and alcohol license tax, the ministry changed the commission system to a bidding system. Wang Yao, a speculator from outside the industry, steeply increased the bid amount and won the bid to undertake the business, which is more than 16,000 yuan higher than the previous year. The calculation shows that the component is more than 20%. When merchants heard the news, they were extremely alarmed and asked our association for clarification. Our association sent a telegram to the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol on August Youri, asking for clarification. On September 5th, the Tax Administration approved the issuance of the 972nd document, which stated, 'The Shangbao tobacco and alcohol license tax has increased significantly. Merchants are alarmed. Please order the bureau to explain.' It was known from the You telegram that the tobacco and alcohol license tax has been changed to a selection commission this time, and the increase in the bid amount is purely to turn private into public and eliminate corruption. The collection follows the old rules, so how can it affect the merchants? Moreover, it is an open election, and the selection commission will naturally choose the one with the highest bid amount. There is no reason to abandon the more and take the less. The claim in the telegram does not clearly understand the purpose of our administration to verify tax revenue and eliminate accumulated malpractices. Please order the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol to explain clearly and forward the information.' Upon receiving this, it proves that the director of the Tax Administration clearly understands the difficulties of the merchants and clearly instructs that the collection should follow the old rules, which is a definite proof that there is no increase in the burden. However, our association is sincerely afraid that the collection sub-bureau will try to profit and abuse its power, or that there will be acts of harsh collection, and that it will satisfy its desires, and then use the assistance of the police district to make peace-loving merchants subject to its oppression. The Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Joint Meeting decided on September 7th to submit a petition to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and to send separate letters to each district office of the city's public security, explaining the difficulties of the merchants and requesting that the meaning of sympathy for the merchants be included in the assistance. The entire body passed a resolution that, in addition to submitting and sending letters separately, the documents should be presented jointly, and it is hoped that the superiors will review and approve them. In consideration of the difficulties of the merchants, please order all districts to handle the situation according to the Ministry's approval in the event of arbitrary tax increases and disputes arising therefrom, so as to show sympathy and secure commerce, and still ask for approval to follow. It is for the public's convenience."</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Protests Case of American Soldier Beating Peddler to Death</h3>
<p>The United States is a Civilized Country Under the Rule of Law, and Our Country Has a Long-Standing Friendship</p>
<p>The Sailor's Behavior Harms His Country's Reputation and Should Be Punished with Compassion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, according to a letter from lawyer Chen Ru, the party concerned, Hu Cai, claims that her husband, Da Kun, was a fruit vendor. He relied on the meager profits of his hard work and was extremely poor. Unexpectedly, on the night of August 25th, he was selling fruit in front of the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Road when four American sailors, returning without leave, grabbed the fruit and ate it without paying a penny. When he argued with them slightly, he was brutally beaten, resulting in serious injuries and death. The widow has been blind for a long time and cannot work. She has six children, all of whom are young. Their daily life depended on her husband. Now that she has suffered such a misfortune and her grievances have not been addressed, what will the widow and orphans rely on in the future? Please, lawyer, stand up for justice and send a letter to the Taxpayer Association on behalf of the union to negotiate with the Municipal Council in accordance with reason, so as to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderer and providing compensation. Both the living and the dead are grateful." The fact that the American sailor relied on his strength to beat an innocent peddler to death is truly inhumane and disregards justice. If he is not punished according to the law and provided with generous compensation, how can the dead be comforted and the family be settled? Although the sailor who caused the incident was detained by the police and handed over to the relevant commander for verification, your association is the representative organization of the Shanghai citizens and its duty is to maintain the interests of the citizens. If the sailor is so barbaric and treats the people like weeds, if he is allowed to go unpunished, then this trend will grow and the millions of citizens in Shanghai will be in danger. In addition to our lawyer sending another letter to the Municipal Council asking it to uphold justice and investigate according to the law, we are sending a special letter to your association, asking it to send a letter to the Municipal Council, asking it to uphold justice and hire a foreign lawyer to negotiate in accordance with reason, so as to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderer and providing compensation in order to show fairness. The United States is a civilized country under the rule of law and places great emphasis on humanitarianism, and its relationship with our country has always been cordial. The sailor's beating to death is inevitably a stain on the virtue of your country. It is hoped that you can provide generous compensation and punish the murderer according to the law. According to the letter, we are sending a letter to your bureau asking it to handle the matter according to the law and achieve the purpose of providing compensation and punishing the murderer."</p>
<h3>National Shipping Industry Resolves to Collect Cash for Shipping Fees</h3>
<p>Implemented from September 15th</p>
<p>Since the 1/28 incident, all industries in Shanghai have been hit hard, and the impact on the Chinese shipping industry has been even greater. Recently, the ships traveling to the north and south seas have been operating sluggishly and affected by financial conditions. The shipping association convened all members yesterday and publicly discussed that from the 15th of this month, all import and export shipping fees should be collected in cash and no credit should be given, in order to maintain the status quo. The phenomenon of the decline of shipping is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Loss of Northeast Business: Since Japan forcibly occupied the Northeast on 9/18, the business of Chinese ships in ports such as Andong, Yingkou, and Dalian has been severely hit. Since the Northeast opened to navigation every year, from March to October, Chinese ships competed to load soybeans to the ports of Nanhua. This year, most Chinese ships cannot go there (except for some who use Japanese shipowners). The loss of this route this year cannot be calculated in numbers. Recently, the Volunteer Army has been active in all directions, and the Yingkou area has completely suspended the handling of goods. The Tai Ku wheel, a British merchant ship that specializes in sailing to Yingkou, has been postponed repeatedly due to lack of cargo. All business has been monopolized by Japanese ships, and at least sixteen or seventeen ships have been stopped from sailing on the Northeast route.</p>
<p>Decline in Northern Shipping Operations: The ports of Yantian, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Weihai on the North Sea route have never improved since the war this year. At first, the silver and money industry stopped lending, and most merchants could not handle goods. The market turnover was sluggish. Recently, rumors of the Japanese army attacking Rehe have caused a complete halt to department stores. Only a small amount of flour is loaded. Moreover, some Chinese ships in the Northeast route have moved to North China, resulting in a shortage of goods and an oversupply of tonnage. Recently, even if a ship is sailing, the shipping fees collected are not enough to cover the cost of fuel coal. Therefore, no ship is not losing money.</p>
<p>Southern Goods Are Not Congested: In recent years, the goods going to Fujian, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangdong in South China have been very small. The main business of transshipping from the Northeast has been cut off, and the Chinese ships have been severely hit. The Nanhua ships of China Merchants have already stopped sailing two ships. The Sanbei Company took the opportunity to add the Taishan wheel to the Nanhua class, which will sail tomorrow. At present, there are only three Chinese ships sailing to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong in Shanghai. Because there are few shifts, they can barely support themselves.</p>
<p>Shipping Fees are Collected in Cash: In the past, the northbound and southbound ships of various shipping companies in Shanghai usually recorded the freight for up to three months. This year, they were hit by the Shanghai War, and the business on all routes was sluggish. The price of various materials and hardware stores used on the ships was high, and cash was required for payment, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, the Shipping Association convened representatives of more than 40 shipping companies yesterday to discuss ways to maintain business. It was decided that from September 15th, all import and export shipping fees for sea-going vessels sailing on the north and south routes will be collected in cash and no credit will be given. The cash collection method has been decided by the company and will be announced to the newspapers today for all customers to follow in order to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Opium Hidden in Broom Handles</h3>
<p>Secrets Revealed When Scattered on the Ground</p>
<p>HeNan native Hu Dewang hired No. 947 rickshaw at the Bund Customs Wharf at 10:55 AM yesterday and loaded 41 brooms, ordering rickshaw driver Sun A'san to pull them to Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. When the rickshaw passed Fuzhou Road, two brooms suddenly fell to the ground. At that time, a plainclothes police officer with No. 766 and No. 1480 from the General Patrol House happened to pass by and picked up the brooms, preparing to catch up and return them. Unexpectedly, a smell of opium emanated from the brooms. The two officers chased after the rickshaw, stopped it, and after inspection, found that the broom handles were hollowed out and filled with opium. They took Hu and the opium to the General Patrol House. Chinese detective Wu Chunrong weighed the confiscated opium, which weighed 396 taels. Hu was arrested and sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division 1 yesterday morning. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Patrol House, prosecuted him for selling opium in violation of Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law, and said that according to the defendant's confession at the Patrol House, the items were given to him by two men wearing Western suits to carry. Therefore, the Patrol House hoped to arrest the two men and requested the court to adjourn the hearing. Then, the two Chinese officers who filed the case proved the circumstances of the arrest. When asked by the defendant, he firmly stated that he was entrusted by two men wearing Zhongshan suits who he did not know to carry the items. Feng Shide, the head of the criminal court, checked the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained and the hearing adjourned.</p>

<h3>Two Thousand Yuan in Banknotes Disappears</h3>
<p>Carrying Banknotes by Car Interrupted En Route</p>
<p>Two People Get on the Car and Realize the Banknotes Have Been Stolen</p>
<p>The Bank of China at No. 22 Renji Road in Beishi dispatched Fu Anding, a Ningbo native and old clerk, at around 4:00 AM yesterday to carry banknotes worth 2,000 yuan to a flower shop in Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Fu immediately carried the money and took a car prepared by the bank, driven by Wang A'san, a Yangzhou native, to Nanshi. When they arrived near the Gongyi Wharf on Luban Road, they found that the workers of the Municipal Public Works Bureau were repairing the road. Wang stopped the car and got out with Fu, asking the workers to move the bricks and stones piled up in the middle of the road slightly to facilitate their passage. After they had finished speaking, they got into the car and were about to drive off when they suddenly realized that the 2,000 yuan in banknotes placed in the car had disappeared. They were greatly shocked at the time and immediately reported the matter to Dai Qinglai, the watchman of the 11th post in the area. After reporting to his office, Director Yi questioned Fu and Wang in detail and felt that the details of the case were very bizarre and there were many doubts. He ordered the case to be kept for investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Kidnappers Arrested</h3>
<p>Five Kidnapped Boys and Girls Rescued</p>
<p>After secretly investigating, Hua detective Cai Zhitian of the Bandit Suppression Precinct discovered a large number of kidnappers hiding in house number 27, Xihua Lane, Gongping Road. He coordinated with Western detectives and secretly went to the location the night before last, arresting Fujian natives Lin Hong, Chen Bixue, Lin Shengjin, Yixing woman Wang Xiuying, Fujian woman Lin Li and others. Four boys and one girl were rescued, named Xiao Bao Bao (5 years old), Mao Mao (5 years old), Su Hua (6 years old), and the girl named Lin Di. After interrogation, it was revealed that accomplices Zhao Wang, Zhao Li, and Xue Wang were hiding at house number 24, Beikai'er Road. The detectives went there and apprehended the others. In total, eight male and female kidnappers were arrested and taken back to the precinct for separate detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The precinct's lawyer, Chen Ming, explained the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants and presented the three confiscated sales contracts and 100 yuan in banknotes as evidence, requesting an extension of the detention and stating that the families of the children could not be contacted. According to the girl Lin Di, she is twelve years old, surnamed Zhou, and a native of Ningbo. Her parents died early, and she lived with her aunt at the entrance of Peixing Lane, Dadongmen Street. Her aunt passed away in April of this year. She was sent to work as a factory girl at the Shenxin Seventh Factory in Yangshupu. She now boards and lodges with an old woman named Zhang Jin in a certain number of Wenxing Fang, Dalianwan Road. She recognized the defendants Lin Li and Zhao Wang about a month ago, and they led her to an old woman from Wuxi at a glass shop near the Xia Hai Temple, who transferred her to the Fujian woman Lin Li, the defendant, at number 27, Xihua Lane, Gongping Road, to be bought as a goddaughter. Lin Li has a biological son named Da Bao Bao, who is twelve years old, and she was not being married to him, etc. Judge Shen Bingrong briefly questioned each defendant and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date. The four boys and one girl were sent by the precinct to the Chinese Women and Children Relief Society for temporary care.</p>
<h3>Condition of Jardine Matheson's Jiahe Steamer After Running Aground</h3>
<p>Fore Cabin Damaged, Passengers and Crew Safe</p>
<p>The Jiahe, a steamer of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., sailed to the upper Yangtze River after being repaired in Shanghai last time. On the 4th of this month, it set sail from Yichang to Chongqing, carrying a large amount of cotton yarn. At 4:00 PM on the 7th, when the ship reached the river about fifty miles downstream from Chongqing, the river pilot was careless due to the strong current, causing the Jiahe to run aground on a submerged reef. The bottom of the hull was damaged by the reef, the iron plates were dented into the cabin, and suddenly broke. Water immediately entered the cabin. The shipowner sent out an emergency signal, which was received by an American warship, which sailed to rescue them. The American warship sent a radio message to Shanghai, reporting that the Jiahe had an accident on the upper Yangtze River and claiming that the ship had sunk. When this alarming news reached Shanghai, passengers and their families eagerly inquired about the truth. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. also telegraphed Chongqing to inquire about the cause of the Jiahe accident. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from Chongqing, reporting the conditions of the grounding, stating that the bottom of the forward cabin was damaged but the main structure was not affected, and that all passengers and crew were safe. Currently, the Jiahe has gone to Chongqing. According to news from the company yesterday, the Jiahe will soon return from Chongqing to Yichang. The damaged area may be towed back to Shanghai for major repairs.</p>
<h3>Completion of Shanghai Municipal Jiangwan No. 1 Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>No. 2, 3, and 4 Cemeteries to be Established in Succession</p>
<p>Site Also Determined for Caohejing Crematorium</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, recognizing that private funeral homes are solely profit-oriented, and that scattered coffined burials in the countryside are both unsanitary and uneconomical, proposed the construction of public cemeteries. It was originally planned to build the No. 1 cemetery in Jiangwan, the No. 2 cemetery in Pusong, the No. 3 cemetery in Caojing, and the No. 4 cemetery in Pudong. Each cemetery would occupy more than 100 mu of land and could accommodate approximately 4,000 to 5,000 coffins. However, due to the city's financial constraints, it was difficult to proceed with all projects simultaneously, so it was proposed to build them in phases. The No. 1 cemetery in Jiangwan has now been completed. The cemetery occupies 120 mu of land and includes facilities such as a ceremony hall and rest area. Roads surround the cemetery and provide direct access to the gravesites. There are 4,000 Class A gravesites and 1,000 Class B gravesites. The rental fee for Class A gravesites is 60 yuan per site, while Class B gravesites are free. The No. 2 cemetery is planned to be established next year, with additional cemeteries built annually thereafter. Recently, it was also proposed to build a crematorium in Caohejing, with an estimated area of 10 mu and a cost of 20,000 yuan. The site has been identified, and the plan has been approved by the municipal government. Construction will begin as soon as funding is available. The regulations for the management of municipal public cemeteries and the detailed rules for the management office of municipal public cemeteries are copied below:</p>

<h3>Qi Zhang Lawsuit Scheduled for Judgment</h3>
<p>Qi Rengxi, a native of Fujian, currently residing at No. 72, Wanyi Fang, Luban Road in the French Concession, fell in love with his wife's younger sister, Zhang Meili, ten years ago when his wife Zhang Meifeng was seriously ill in Tianjin. They have been living together for ten years and have seven children, five boys and two girls, the oldest being eleven years old and the youngest only nine months old. Qi was active in Tianjin, where he founded the Xiehe Company and served as general manager. The company went bankrupt in 1928, owing more than four million yuan. Qi was detained by Governor Zhu at the military law office, but Mei Li paid for his rescue. After his release, Qi had disagreements with his wife and went with Mei Li to the Northeast, where he frequented Zhang Xueliang's residence in Fengtian, becoming a prominent political figure in the Northeast. Last year, he came to Shanghai and founded the Guanhai Evening News, but later reconciled with his wife and became estranged from Mei Li. The Evening News was shut down. Qi filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special District Court to terminate his relationship with Mei Li. This spring, Mei Li also sued Qi in the criminal court of the Second Special District Court for undermining public morals. After two trials, the case was concluded on the grounds that it was a civil matter, so Mei Li lost the lawsuit. After the criminal lawsuit ended, Qi proceeded with the civil lawsuit. Mei Li then filed a civil counterclaim, seeking compensation of 140,000 gold yuan for the upbringing and education expenses of the seven children. As she was unable to pay the litigation fees, she applied for legal aid, which was approved by the former Judge Qu. The case was summoned for questioning, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, another summons was issued, and both parties and their representatives, lawyers Xu Zuyan and Li Zuyu, arrived at the court to await instructions. At 11:00 AM, Judge Zhu Ganlin opened the fourth civil court to hear the case, questioning both parties in detail about the origin of their animosity and the history of their changing affections. After the questioning, he ordered the debate to begin. After the lawyers for both sides debated according to the law, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the judgment for the 19th of this month.</p>

<h3>Java Company Offers Preferential Treatment to Chinese Passengers</h3>
<p>Due to the Xiao Case Impact</p>
<p>Negotiations by Mr. Qian Yield Results</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies is the most popular destination for Chinese traveling abroad for trade. Java, Batavia, and other places can only be reached by Java Company ships. Although British and French mail companies also sell tickets, they all require transfers. Therefore, Java Company ships are particularly sought after for both passengers and cargo. One ship sails from Shanghai every week, with a total of ten "Zhi" class ships. The business is very prosperous. Since the Xiao case occurred on the Zhibade ship two years ago, Chinese people have been extremely angry. Although the company fired the perpetrators, the Chinese people's resentment has not subsided, and the boycott is very strong, which has affected the business. In view of this, the company, after consulting with the Chinese and Western Trade Association in February of this year, dispatched Mr. Qian Chongfu to inspect the South Seas region and negotiate with the Java headquarters to improve the treatment of Chinese passengers. The results are good. It is heard that Mr. Qian has already returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, the reporter met him at the company. According to him, he was sent to inspect the South Seas region, passing through Hong Kong, Little Luzon, Makassar, Batavia, Java, and more than ten other ports, traveling back and forth for more than four months. The scenery there is very beautiful, and the weather is warm. The inland areas of Yogyakarta, Surakarta, and other places are rich in produce. The natives there all believe in tree worship, praying to trees. Their knowledge is very rudimentary. There are more Chinese than natives. As for negotiating with the headquarters on the issue of preferential treatment for Chinese passengers, the results are very satisfactory. In the future, Chinese passengers, regardless of their class of ticket, will be managed by Chinese compradors, and the shipowners will not interfere. The onboard services will also be improved, so there is no need to worry when taking the company's ships in the future.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Disaster Victims Demand Continued Relief</h3>
<p>The disaster victims in Hejiazhai, Zhabei, who were displaced by the Shanghai war, were once given relief by Wang Binyan, director of the charity organization, a month ago. However, almost a month has passed, and the disaster victims are worried about clothing and food as autumn approaches and the weather suddenly turns cold. The people earnestly pleaded with the delegation representatives He Huijun and He Ruiren to again ask Director Wang Binyan for continued and adequate relief.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Murder on Hongqiao Road</h3>
<p>Dong Genfa Dies, His Wife Seriously Injured</p>
<p>At around 8:30 PM last night, six robbers suddenly appeared inside a tea garden at No. 889 Hongqiao Road. Only one robber had a gun, and another had a knife. The others were empty-handed. The robber with the gun went inside and closed the door tightly. The garden owner, Dong Genfa, and a partner, seeing this, tried to escape, but their exit was blocked, so they had to submit to their fate. However, when the robber with the gun went inside to rob money, Dong's wife desperately rushed to the door and shouted for help. She was blocked by the robber with the knife outside the door, and the two became entangled in a fight. The robber used the knife to stab her in the throat. Fearing that this would turn out badly, the robber with the gun also turned around and fled. Dong Genfa chased after him, pouncing on the robber with the knife. However, the robber with the gun saw him and shot at Dong, missing the first shot. He fired a second shot, hitting Dong in the chest. Dong immediately fell to the ground. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the robbers fired another shot into the air and fled into the wilderness. Because the area was remote, the incident was not noticed until the robbers fired the gun. A Westerner living nearby heard it and immediately used the telephone to report it to the police. The police dispatched detectives to investigate and discovered what had happened. However, the robbers had already fled. Dong Genfa and his wife were rushed to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. However, Dong died en route due to his serious injuries. Dong's wife's injuries were also quite critical. The police are currently pursuing the case.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault on Avenue Foch</h3>
<p>At 11:30 PM the night before last, five robbers broke into house number 123, Xiqing Lane, Avenue Foch in the French Concession, each armed with a handgun, and ransacked the house, escaping with more than one hundred yuan. A woman named Gu Maotou chased after them and shouted for help, but was shot in the foot by one of the robbers, who then escaped without a trace. After hearing the news, the police immediately dispatched detectives to investigate and sent Gu to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injuries are not serious and there is no danger to her life.</p>
<h3>Wusong Electricity Has Not Yet Been Restored</h3>
<p>Municipal Committee Requests Order to Resume Operations</p>
<p>The provision of electricity to all users in the Wusong area has been the responsibility of the privately-run Baoming Electric Company. Since the outbreak of war, the factory site has been destroyed and suffered great damage, causing delays until now, with no news of restoration. Therefore, Wusong is still a dark world. The Wusong Municipal Committee members Tang Chengzong and Liu Ziwen, in view of this, yesterday submitted a document to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, stating: "Submitting a request to order the electric company to resume operations within a limited time, in order to revitalize the city. The degree of post-war recovery in our district is no less than that of other war zones, but electricity is still lacking. The streets are dark at night, causing inconvenience to commerce and public security. Citizens are complaining. The original Baoming Electric Company in our district has been operating for many years and was quite prosperous. Since the outbreak of war, it has suffered losses and has yet to show any real intention to resume operations. It is also heard that the company has a proposal to merge with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, but this is also far from certain. Electricity is an important public utility, and has a close relationship with society. Now that Baoming Company is neither resuming operations on its own nor merging with Zhabei, and is repeatedly delaying, making the entire town a dark world for a long time, it is very inappropriate. We earnestly request your bureau to order the company to start resuming operations immediately and to find a way to provide electricity in the shortest possible time. If the company is unable to proceed, for the sake of the needs of the citizens and for the convenience of public security, we have no choice but to request your bureau to take decisive action and take it over for municipal operation, in order to facilitate recovery. This is for the public good."</p>
<h3>Hardoon Company Sues Tianbaozhai for Rent Arrears</h3>
<p>Tianbaozhai, located at No. 80, Minfeng Lane, Jiujiang Road, was sued by Shen Licheng, the property manager of the Hardoon Company, for defaulting on rent. Shen retained a lawyer and filed a suit in the First Special District Court, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay the rent arrears and move out immediately, and to approve a preliminary attachment. Lang Jingji, the owner of Tianbaozhai Pharmacy, the defendant, retained lawyer Jiang Chiping to argue that a problem had arisen between the landlord and the tenant that could not be resolved, so the plaintiff did not come to collect the rent, but instead sued for rent arrears. The so-called problem was, first, the requirement to use the solar calendar to collect rent, and second, the citywide rent reduction event. Because these problems were not resolved, the plaintiff stopped collecting rent, so the defendant temporarily deposited the monthly rent payments in the bank. His request to terminate the lease contract is even more a nitpicking and fabricated lawsuit, and should be dismissed, and he should be ordered to bear the litigation costs in order to suppress the strong and cunning. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shi of the court summoned the case for trial. Shen Licheng, the plaintiff's property manager, testified that the defendant owed six months of rent, totaling 450 taels of silver. Lawyer Jiang Chiping, representing the defendant, stated that since the landlord is the Hardoon Company, and Shen Licheng is now in court to prosecute, if he is representing Hardoon, he should submit a letter of authorization. However, he does not have such authorization, so he has no right to sue. The plaintiff's request for preliminary attachment is also completely unfounded and should be dismissed. The judge then ordered the plaintiff to submit a formal letter of authorization and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<p>Last Year's Report</p>
<p>The Secretariat's report for the previous term is excerpted below. The 1931-1932 football season in Shanghai was unprecedented, with no match reaching completion. The Sino-Japanese conflict extended to Shanghai, and all sports activities in the area were suspended at the end of January. After six weeks, the situation and weather made it possible to conclude the matches, but the practical difficulties of continuing the games remained elusive. The biggest impact of not continuing the matches was on the Western Police team, which had qualified for the Scotto Cup final, the Senior Cup semi-final, and had good prospects in the First Division league. However, due to the general assembly order for officers in the police department, despite consultations with the Chief Inspector, they had to respect the Inspector's opinion. The Chinese National Sports Association also believed that although the incident had stopped, the people's emotions were still high, and it was better for the Chinese teams to temporarily suspend participation. Therefore, although there were friendly matches later, the actual matches of the previous term had stopped on January 22. The situation of each group in the previous term is listed below.</p>
<p>First Division League: The First Division league and the Second and Third Divisions were canceled entirely after being suspended at the end of January.</p>
<p>Nations Cup: Reached the second week of matches. The subsequent schedule was England vs. Italy, Jewish vs. Portugal, Japan vs. Scotland, China vs. Russia.</p>
<p>Scotto Cup: Donghua and Western Police qualified for the final.</p>
<p>Senior Cup: The British Army Lincoln team, which was about to leave Shanghai, qualified for the final. Donghua and Western Police qualified for the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Junior Cup: Reached the fourth week. The unfinished schedule was (1) Dongguang or Lincoln Leather vs. Youyou, (2) Scott Depot or Pagoda vs. Jewish, (3) Special Service Team vs. Lacrosse or Hualing, (4) St. Francis vs. Lincoln Headquarters.</p>
<p>Zilin Cup: Reached the fourth week. The unfinished matches were (1) St. Francis vs. Western Police, (2) Special Service Team had qualified for the semi-finals, (3) Scott Depot vs. Hujiang or Portugal, (4) AFS vs. Serres.</p>
<p>Interport Matches: The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport match was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai during the Lunar New Year. The players had also been selected, and the Hong Kong team was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on January 30. As a result, on January 29, a telegram was sent to the Hong Kong club to cancel the match and request them to stop coming to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fouls and Lateness: The number of player fouls and team lateness has not decreased. The committee is inclined to take stricter measures. Regarding the large number of teams participating in each group last year, thanks to the assistance of Hongkou Park, the Racecourse Yiyuan, and the China Baseball Field, no difficulties were encountered. It can be stated that the standard of football last year, as a whole, was still high. Although there were many participating teams in the junior group, considering Shanghai's population ratio, this increase is appropriate.</p>
<h3>Summer Football Taiping vs. Chinese Police Compete for Inter-Team Cup</h3>
<p>Finals Held This Afternoon</p>
<p>| Yesterday, Huadong Won 4-0 Against Qunhua |</p>
<p>Inter-Team Cup Final: The teams that have qualified for the Summer Football Inter-Team Cup final are Taiping and Chinese Police. The final has been scheduled for 3:30 PM this afternoon at the China Baseball Field. The Summer League has two groups. The schedule is also listed below:</p>
<p>Team Name and Group | Time and Venue | Referee</p>
<p>Taiping vs. Chinese Police (Final) | 3:30 PM Baseball Field | He Chunhui</p>
<p>Dajiang vs. Xingguang (Part 1) | 5:00 PM Baseball Field | Huang Renyi</p>
<p>Qiangnan vs. Zhihua (Part 1) | 5:00 PM Football Field | Shen Huichun</p>
<p>Huadong Wins Against Qunhua: Only one group match was held yesterday, which was Huadong vs. Qunhua. As a result, Huadong won by four goals. The Qunhua team only had nine players on the field, so their strength was greatly reduced. The Huadong lineup was also not perfect, and they played casually and coped with ease. They won by three goals in the first half and one goal in the second half. The goal scorers were as follows: (1) Dong Xiaopei, (2) Qian Jingyong, (3) Hu Youcheng, (4) Qunhua mistakenly kicked the ball into their own net.</p>
<h3>Xianfang Cup Championship Belongs to Yukuai</h3>
<p>Runner-up is Zhonghua Club</p>
<p>The second Xianfang Cup of the Shanghai Chinese Tennis Association. Since the heroes from ten directions gathered on July 17, all the matches are about to conclude, and the status of each team has become apparent. It is heard that the association has already prepared the championship badges to be awarded to each member of the champion Yukuai team, and the prize flag for the runner-up Zhonghua Club. As for the individual championship silver cup, six are needed for this year, and Mr. Hong Xianfang, who initiated the cup, has graciously donated them. Such a person as Mr. Hong can truly be called a zealous promoter.</p>
<p>All unplayed matches are now limited to be reported to the secretariat of the association before the 17th of this month, in order to conclude the competition. Those who still fail to do so will be considered as forfeits by both sides with no points awarded. The schedule of the unplayed matches is as follows:</p>
<p>Tongle vs. Feipeng: First singles, third set</p>
<p>Huaguang vs. Xiaguang: First doubles</p>

<h3>Youheng Football Team to Compete Against Postal Service Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Youheng Sports Association football team is scheduled to compete against the Shanghai Postal Administration football team at the China Baseball Field at 9:00 AM on the 11th. The Youheng team lineup is Zheng Weibang, Wang Dekang, Wu Xuechu, Mei Zifan, Hong Zunsan, Yu Binqi, Shao Yugong, Shen Shiyan, Kong Zhi, Deng Quyang, Shen Bingcong. The reinforcements are Sun Shuliang, Zhang Yishi, Wu Boying, Zhang Yicong, etc. The records of the two teams have been checked.</p>
<h3>News from the China Race Walking Association</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, there has been no time to attend to various sports. Therefore, the men's 13-mile long-distance race walking and the women's 5,000-meter race walking initiated by the China Race Walking Association have been temporarily suspended. Due to various reasons, they cannot be held again and have been announced in the newspaper. The International Games this year will be held in October. The 5,000-meter race walking event is a great opportunity to compete with the "blue-eyed" foreigners. Mr. Zhou Quanyu, who won the 5,000-meter race walking championship and set a new record, will participate again, and Mr. Shi Jinsheng, the champion of the International Race Walking who broke the record last year, also intends to join. The competition will definitely be intense at that time. It is understood that members of the association who are fond of race walking and wish to join should contact the association.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian of the National Tennis Championship Advances to the Quarterfinals</h3>
<p>| Last Year's Runner-Up Lord Fails</p>
<p>| Barnes Defeats Stephens</p>
<p>| Cumming Loses to Allison</p>
<p>New York, Forest Hills, 8th - The semi-quarterfinals of the National Tennis Championship were decided today. The only surviving French general in the invading army, Ke Xian, won again and advanced to the quarterfinals. Veteran champion Barnes also defeated Stephens. The meeting between the French and American teachers is imminent. Last year's runner-up Lord's defeat to Sedel was shocking news. At the same time, Allison eliminated Wood with a score of 3-1.</p>
<p>Ke Xian's Lone Deep Dive: Eight foreign players participated in the competition, but so far only the French general Ke Xian remains standing tall. He defeated Hills today and advanced to the quarterfinals. The French champion still uses his gradual approach to eliminate enemy generals. He lost the first set 4-6, but in the next three sets, he seemed to be in control as the host. He completely dominated the game, and even achieved a complete victory in the final set.</p>
<p>Sedel is Formidable: After the American new general Sedel defeated the British advocate Austin with a score of 3-0, the spectators praised him. Unexpectedly, he defeated Lord today, which is also a surprise in this tournament. The competition in the first set was fierce, but victory belonged to the newcomer. Lord performed even better in the second and third sets, and won completely. It is indeed true that the younger generation is formidable.</p>
<p>Barnes Wins Again: Barnes won again today, defeating Stephens 3-0, becoming the first to advance to the final four. At the same time, the American Davis Cup participant Allison defeated Wood 3-1. Wood initially won the first set, but eventually lost three consecutive sets due to insufficient experience and was eliminated.</p>
<p>The Final Four of this Tournament: The National Tennis Championship singles competition, where heroes compete for the deer, produced the final four today. The results at the time of entry into the quarterfinals are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Ke Xian (France) defeats Hills (USA) 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0</p>
<p>(2) Sedel (USA) defeats Lord (USA) 10-8, 6-0, 6-0</p>
<p>(3) Allison (USA) defeats Wood (USA) 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4</p>
<p>(4) Barnes (USA) defeats Stephens (USA) 6-3, 7-5, 6-4</p>

<p>Twenty-One Miscellaneous Talks</p>
<h3>From Swift Horse Bones to Eagle Bones</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Thousands of gold could buy a swift horse in the past,</p>
<p>Millions are useless to find an eagle today;</p>
<p>From now on, the Dragon Palace adds to its fighting strength,</p>
<p>Warships guard the crystal capital.</p>
<p>They are both piles of dry bones, but some are willing to pay a high price for swift horse bones, while no one is willing to pay a high price for eagle bones. How lucky are swift horse bones? How unlucky are eagle bones?</p>
<p>King Zhao of Yan spent a thousand gold to buy swift horses, but unfortunately, the horse died first. King Zhao still used five hundred gold to buy back the skeleton of the dead horse. This story is recorded in the Strategies of the Warring States. The dry bones of a dead horse were still worth five hundred gold, passed down through the ages as a beautiful tale.</p>
<p>Wasn't there news that the Flying Eagle battleship, which had been sunk in the sea for a long time, was going to be salvaged? However, according to Cantonese reports, the plan to salvage it has been canceled again. This is because the headquarters sent an American engineer to investigate and estimate: the cost of salvage would be about 300,000 silver dollars; the cost of repairs would be about 800,000 silver dollars; the total cost would be 1.1 million silver dollars to turn a dead eagle into a live eagle. There is no spare money in the treasury, so these eagle bones will have to sink to the bottom of the sea for a long time!</p>
<p>Someone is willing to pay a high price to buy swift horse bones, but no one is willing to spend a lot of money to salvage eagle bones. Alas! After the sunken Flying Eagle has been submerged for years, won't it be treated like the "broken halberd buried in the sand remains unrusted" in the nostalgic poem about Chibi?</p>
<p>Our Navy Department has lost some fighting strength: the Dragon King's Navy Department will certainly increase its fighting strength by some amount. This seven-character quatrain of mine serves two purposes:</p>
<p>1. To mourn the Flying Eagle.</p>
<p>2. To congratulate the Dragon King.</p>
<h3>Sleeping Pig</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ping</p>
<p>The Chinese People Should Wake Up!</p>
<p>Japanese people insulting Chinese people anytime and anywhere has almost become a common habit. In their eyes, Chinese people are simply piglets who are bound to be slaughtered and allowed to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>In a book called "Japan's New Manchuria-Mongolia Policy" written by Yamada Takeji, there is a sentence like this, which is translated as follows:</p>
<p>"::: At this moment, China, the 'sleeping lion,' has exposed its true face as a 'sleeping pig,' and is a piece of meat on the chopping board for various countries."</p>
<p>The meaning of this sentence is very obvious: Yamada believes that the nickname "sleeping lion" given to China by foreigners in the past is not accurate enough; because if China is really a sleeping lion, it should wake up and fight like a trapped beast under the heavy wounds, but China not only has no preparations for a trapped beast fight, but is still sleeping in this way, then it is certainly not a man-eating "lion" but a "pig" that is eaten by people! After reading this sentence, I was very angry, but after calmly and quietly recalling history, I was ashamed to find no materials that could refute Yamada's ridicule.</p>
<p>In the two major changes of "September 18th" and "January 28th", Japan is advancing step by step, while China is retreating step by step. People are slaughtered without causing any indignation, and land is occupied without causing any grief. The government repeatedly exhorts the people to be calm, and the people still think that the fire has not burned their eyebrows and are on the other side of the river, and they can still watch, which is a state of indifference, unawareness, and indifference. These "deeply sleeping" people are really a bit chilling!</p>
<p>Time passes quickly, and the "September 18th" of the second year is coming again. Friends, wake up! Just keep sleeping like this, and you will really become sleeping pigs!</p>
<h3>The Boundary of Water</h3>
<p>— Yu Renying</p>
<p>The Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>One Sunday morning, I felt very bored, so I went to the Waibaidu Bridge Park to breathe some relatively fresh air. At this time, there were very few people, only a few people were playing Tai Chi together.</p>
<p>I strolled along the riverside, and the junction of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek appeared before my eyes. Several coolies were pushing a boat against the wind, and I looked at them with sympathy. When I was observing the river surface, I couldn't help but be surprised: why does the water flow of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek divide into a boundary line? On the side of the Huangpu River, it is a deep yellow color containing sand. On the side of the Suzhou Creek, it is a dark black color as if something is settled and stained: they do not invade each other, even though the water is surging, and despite drilling into places that can be reached. It made me recall the journey to Min in the past. On a certain ocean surface, the sea water on one side was undulating with turquoise waves. On the other hand, frightening black waves were raging.</p>
<p>Could this be the boundary between the river and the sea, the sea and the ocean?</p>
<h3>Conflicting Psychology</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>| General Observation |</p>
<p>In this deformed society, it is easiest to show the conflicting psychology of ordinary people. Some examples are listed below: A young man feels that life is boring and monotonous. He always sacrifices everything to pursue women, hoping to achieve the ultimate goal | marriage | After the goal is achieved, he feels more economic and other problems, and feels that love is not enough to compensate for his losses. He also envies the freedom of bachelors.</p>
<p>People living in rural areas are longing for the prosperous and fairy-like Shanghai, while people living in Shanghai are admiring the quiet and comfortable rural life. The modern girls standing on the new position, their slogans have long been shouted, "Equal rights for men and women," "liberation," "freedom," etc., but nine out of ten of them cannot be economically independent and have to rely on men's lives. How can they seek "equal rights" and "seek liberation?" Isn't this inconsistent with words and deeds?</p>
<p>"It is unfortunate to be born as a woman in life," "I wish I could be a daughter in the next life." These two sentences are absolutely contradictory. Who should be abandoned and who should be taken? I have always found it difficult to get a clear answer. Now that I see modern women taking advantage and showing off everywhere, it is better to use the second sentence as the best.</p>
<h3>Two Types of Armed Classes</h3>
<p>— Ge Chonglou</p>
<p>| Gun and Opium Pipe |</p>
<p>There are many types of guns, such as rifles, pistols, box cannons, machine guns: etc. Some are easy to carry, and some are easy to shoot. In general, it is a lethal weapon.</p>
<p>The country manufactures guns and weapons to defend the territory and protect the national soul. General Ma Zhanshan's battles in Eastern Province and General Cai Tingkai's resistance against Japan in Shanghai are all examples of understanding righteousness and fulfilling their responsibilities. Not only do compatriots across the country praise them, but people all over the world also express their sympathy.</p>
<p>I have written a lot of words, but I have not written into the main text. The two types of armed classes I want to talk about now, one is brave in civil war but dare not turn the muzzle outward, and the other is the armed class who swallow clouds and spit fog. Although opium pipes and bullets are different in nature, we see that people who hold opium pipes not only weaken and die themselves, but their wives also suffer. Therefore, we believe that opium pipes and bullets are equally dangerous! They are equally lethal weapons!</p>
<p>"Gun muzzle inward" and "gun barrel inward" are both suicidal policies and are going astray. I advise people in these two classes to "gun muzzle outward" and "put down the gun barrel" from now on. Then, there is a glimmer of hope for the revival of our China!</p>

<p>"Good! We don't need to talk about the past anymore, but you should remember a sentence I said before: I will definitely have a chance to see you again in the future, but at that time, it will definitely not be the Yuan Hepu of the old days, nor the Yuan Hepu who was a primary school teacher. You shouldn't have forgotten that sentence, right? In the past ten years, I have suffered all kinds of hardships for you and for the country. I have put my life, reputation, and property all aside. Alas! Fenming! You are old, but no matter what, it is always my fault. But, do you know? This house, how could I have known at the time that it was your home, otherwise I would definitely not have allowed the enemy's artillery to destroy your neighbors on the left and right, leaving your house isolated and pitiful. I didn't even know at the time that you lived in this town, otherwise I would have found you in advance, protected you from danger, and prevented you from being frightened at all."</p>
<p>"Alas! My house? Where did I get my own house! The rented house was long ago destroyed by the artillery fire; and nothing was left. However, our country has not lost an inch of land, and I deeply admire your bravery. It's really fortunate, thank my God, you are not old yet, and still look like a youth, although you have been in and out of the line of fire, you should be satisfied and work harder. I saw your photo in the newspaper, and I was very surprised, how is it that you look so much like my: : : old friend, I was very happy, I was like crazy, always praying for you to win the war, to win some glory for our nation; but I am very sad, sometimes I often tell myself; your old friend is a primary school teacher, his name is Yuan Hepu, not Yuan Renkai, don't daydream! Isn't such a delusion so foolish and so sad!"</p>
<p>"Yes. I remember once you gave me a letter, and there were two sentences in the letter! Rather be Byron's mistress than Napoleon's abandoned wife. I also remember you once said to me: A man should learn from the knights of the Middle Ages, not from Shakespeare who specializes in writing plays. Now I realize how great your words were! I would rather leave you, abandon my family, endure the condemnation of many people at that time, and work hard to put it into practice, until now. Now, you should be satisfied. However, I haven't seen you or heard from you for more than ten years. Seeing you again today is like meeting someone from another life. Fen, what are your feelings?"</p>
<p>At this moment, the madman upstairs suddenly burst into loud laughter, laughing like a man.</p>
<p>"Huh! Who is upstairs?" Regiment Commander Yuan was very surprised and listened attentively; and wanted to go upstairs.</p>
<p>"Alas, sadly, it's a madman, and also my only companion, please don't go to see her, if she sees strangers, she may go even crazier, please forgive me, I will go upstairs to take care of her and then come back to talk to you." Fen Ruo stopped Regiment Commander Yuan and went upstairs by herself.</p>
<p>There was another knock on the door. Regiment Commander Yuan was about to open the door, but the madman upstairs suddenly started to cry bitterly. Her crying was as sad as a three-year-old child whose candy had been snatched away.</p>

<h3>U.S. Government's Second Cotton Crop Report</h3>

<h3>The Downturn in the Grain and Rice Market Intensifies Again</h3>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, there were twenty to thirty incoming boats from various groups. Sales in the market were sluggish, and the downturn in new foreign sharp rice intensified. The opening price dropped by three "chi". Changshu Beigeng rice and Sutong rice were sold as soon as they arrived, and the market price did not fluctuate. Early and late rice from Qingjiaoting, Lin Songyin, and other places continued to arrive, but the appetite from all sides was sluggish, and the price dropped by two "jiao". Bian Yin Yuan rice sold briskly, and there were some transactions, but the market conditions appeared loose. The new japonica rice market saw no rise or fall.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: Yesterday, the supply increased slightly. The situation for both new and old goods was declining. Damaged old rice from Zhongguan was about three to four "jiao" lower. The market conditions were mostly down and little up before the festival. The amount of early thin rice arriving was low, and sales were sluggish, with a drop of one to two "jiao". Transactions of new Duyu rice were increasingly rare. River accumulation increased, and the buying interest was silent. The top-quality goods from Changshu and Xixi did not arrive in large quantities, and there were some retail sales. The production areas continued to report softening, with prices weakening by a "jiao".</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Continues, Northern Merchants Tentatively Start</h3>
<p>Shantou Adds Hunan Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw slightly more activity from traders, but the market conditions have been weak for a long time, making it difficult to recover. As for the sales channels, some Northern merchants purchased 200 bags of Siamese rice and 400 bags of small glutinous rice, and Shantou merchants continued to purchase 400 bags of Hunan rice. Some Saigon small glutinous rice was also purchased on this street. The market situation is very good, but there is no change in the prices. The overall market opened with 1,000 bags of small glutinous rice, priced from $8.75 to $6.70; 500 bags of Saigon rice, priced from $9.45 to $9.22; 200 bags of Siamese rice, priced from $9.10 to $9.05; only 400 bags of Jing rice from Hunan were offered, priced at $7.52. The market is temporarily stable, and a large increase can only be expected if there is a large shipment in the future.</p>
<h3>The Decline in Tapioca Flour Is Still Minor</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tapioca flour market, both in the morning and afternoon for all months, generally showed a flat and weak trend. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat continued to drop by about two "jiao", people inevitably turned bearish. On the manufacturers' side, the sales of current flour have not been smooth, so it is rumored that major factories will temporarily shut down to avoid the accumulation of current flour and to make it easier to acquire wheat. However, whether this will work is still difficult to predict at present. On the traders' side, there were still inquiries from Southeast Asia, but otherwise there was no movement. Therefore, although sentiment is not good, the decline is not sharp. The prices for September to December fell by 7.5 "li" compared to the previous day, and the prices for January and February fell by one "fen," it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Are All Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, both in the morning and afternoon for all months, were stable. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat continued to drop by about two "jiao", the domestic merchants depend on local wheat according to the current standards. If the arrivals are not smooth and there are not many arbitrageurs, it seems that there is not much difference from the quoted price of foreign wheat. The firmness of the sentiment is due to this. However, manufacturers are not interested in inquiries unless the price is low. Given this situation, it will be difficult to lower the price in the future. As a result, the price for this month was two "fen" better than the previous day, the price for October was one "fen" better, the price for November was unchanged, the price for December was one "fen" better, and the price for January was two "fen" better. The current wheat market is also stabilizing, with Yaowan wheat opening at 3 taels, 5 mace, and 7 fen, Yangzhou wheat at 3 taels, 4 mace, 2 fen to 4 mace, 5 fen, and Shaoxing wheat at 3 taels, 4 mace, totaling 2,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Thursday (the 8th), Chicago wheat initially rose due to better export demand, but then fell due to profit-taking. As a result, it was 0.75 to 0.875 pounds lower than the previous day. The total number of transactions on the 7th was 20 million bushels. The market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price       Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September (Old Crop)       52.875       Down 0.875</p>
<p>September (New Crop)       52.625       Down 0.875</p>
<p>December       57.000       Down 0.750</p>
<p>May       62.125       Down 0.875</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods, Hainan Dried Longan Arrivals Are Scarce, Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Hainan dried longan has recently become scarce due to low arrivals, and previous traders have suffered losses, so they are unwilling to sell cheaply. Only about 200 pieces have arrived in this batch, so various businesses are eager to purchase. Yesterday, the Northern and Southern goods markets were open, with top-quality goods opening at 26 taels, with slightly lower prices for lower grades, an increase of about 2 taels compared to the previous price.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h3>Sugar Market: Jianbing Has Been Out of Stock for a Long Time, and Arrivals Have Resumed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a firm rise in the exchange rate and a tight trend in the Dutch exchange rate. No. 24 coarse white granulated sugar (ordinary goods) was priced at 14 taels, 4 mace, 2 fen and a half, an increase of 2.5 fen compared to the previous day. Machine-ground fine white sugar was priced at 14.5 taels, and the medium white sugar market was flat with no increase or decrease. Renji Factory opened with dozens of pieces of top-grade Binghua green, priced at 12 taels and 2 qian. Jianbang firms opened with 20 boxes of Polo Brand high-quality handmade ice sugar, priced at 9 taels and 7 qian per "zhu". The market is expected to rise again. Jianbing has been out of stock for a long time, and the inventory is very low. Yesterday, it was found that the Taikoo Company's Nan Ning Wheel imported 400 boxes, but the cost was high, and they were unwilling to sell without raising the price, so the market situation remained tight.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, European and American Silk Telegrams Are Transferred to Shanghai Daily</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market in Shanghai showed a firm and smooth trend daily. According to European and American markets, Chinese silk mills are still eager to purchase. Yellow and white silk are transferred to Shanghai daily via telegram, and the market is firm and brisk. Yesterday, Lianna, Xinsheng, Dachang, and others purchased 70 packages of grade B Shanghai white silk from 13 to 15 filaments, priced from 645 to 700 taels. They also purchased 50 packages of Sichuan yellow silk from 13 to 15 filaments from Tiejia and Mujia Yangfan, priced from 595 to 660 taels. Samsung Kechang and others purchased 45 packages of Mianyang yellow silk, priced from 370 to 410 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Cocoon Cooking Machine Sales Are Smooth</h3>
<p>Domestic Machine Households Purchase 500 to 600 Loads Daily</p>
<p>The sales of silk factory cocoon cooking machines are now smooth in Europe, and the sales appetite of domestic machine households has also increased. Transactions are brisk. Domestic machine households in Shanghai have purchased a total of 500 to 600 loads of silk factory cocoon cooking machines from Kangsao and Huzhou daily, and the price has increased by 4 to 5 yuan. The current market price of factory goods has opened at 25 to 26 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Xincheng Cocoon Shops Have Opened Scales</h3>
<p>Xin, the price of cocoons collected today is expected to be around 3 "jiao" per catty. In the villages of He Prefecture, both the spring and summer silkworm harvests this year were poor, so the farmers are paying attention to the autumn silkworms. Most of them have already spun silk into cocoons. The cocoon shops preparing to collect cocoons have rented factory buildings, about a dozen of them. For example, the Xin Cocoon Shop opened scales on the 8th, and the Xinzhen Cocoon Shop can also open scales today to collect cocoons. The expected price of cocoons is about 3 "jiao" per catty, it is said.</p>
<h3>Luzhuang Zhenmei Sales Are Smooth, Prices Drop</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi, Wudong, Shexian, Suian, and other places was purchased by British firms such as Yihe, Xiehe, Baochang, and Tongfu. Transactions were not deserted. However, the tea market has been sluggish for several days since last week. The attitude of Chinese merchants is no longer as tough as before, so traders took the opportunity to suppress prices, causing the market to fall by 7 to 8 taels to 10 taels. Although there were some transactions of needle tea and pearl tea, the selling prices also trended downward. Regarding Gongxi tea, the Russian Xiezhuhui still has not relaxed its intentions, but due to the price limits set by foreign telegrams for purchasing goods, the market has not been fully developed. Therefore, the transactions of Gongxi tea in recent days have mostly been of inferior quality.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Hardware Presents a Dull Situation</h3>
<p>There are not many sales of American galvanized iron. Because the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, various groups are taking a wait-and-see approach, so there are not many transactions. However, because the underlying inventory is low, the prices are still firm. Currently, No. 48 is estimated at 15 taels, 2 mace and a half per "dan", No. 28 at 16 taels, No. 26 is estimated at 15 taels, and No. 24 is estimated at 14 taels. Thick grades are sold at 13 taels and 5 qian, it is said.</p>
<p>New lead wire is out of stock. Although there was not much new lead wire opened yesterday, the current stock on the market is depleted, so the market price is standing firm. For example, coarse grades are estimated at around 10 taels, medium grades can also be estimated at 13 taels, 2 mace and a half per "dan", and fine grades are estimated at 18 taels, 2 mace and a half per "dan". It is found that most of the transactions are for coarse and medium grades, while the fine grades are quieter due to fewer transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3>Coal, Fengtian Coal Powder Prices Are Stable</h3>
<p>Fengtian white coal powder has been out of stock for a long time, and the inventory is scarce. However, the selling price has not improved due to sluggish sales. It is now autumn, and various coal briquette factories have begun to purchase goods, so sales have gradually become smooth, and the price has gradually stabilized. Yesterday, 380 tons were traded at 8 taels and 5 qian, it is said.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>September 18th Commemoration</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th Dispatch: Japan is currently making various arrangements to prepare for the September 18th Commemoration.</p>
<p>Nanjing, same day dispatch: The Ministry of Education issued a notice to the education departments of various provinces and cities, instructing the schools under their jurisdiction to follow the central government's regulations to commemorate the September 18th National Humiliation.</p>
<p>The same commemoration, the same September 18th Commemoration, I wonder what the Chinese people think about this kind of commemoration, and what the Japanese people think about this kind of commemoration? What do the Chinese people think about the Japanese commemoration, and what do the Japanese people think about the Chinese commemoration? Each has its own position, and each has its own feelings, which can be left unmentioned.</p>
<p>China has many commemorations, and the commemorations of national humiliation are especially progressing. If all the national humiliations of China are commemorated one by one, I am afraid it will be as busy as Sunday. It is precisely because of the many national humiliations of China that the minds of the Chinese people are numb and insensitive, hardly knowing what commemoration is for, and the commemorative days that can be taken as holidays are the same as the former god-welcoming events on March 28th, the Ullambana Festival on July 15th, etc., all welcomed. Is this kind of commemoration pitiful or not? After experiencing a national humiliation, see how the situation is in China's government and public, and what is the psychology like? The same as before. After experiencing a national crisis, see how the authorities' measures are, and how the people act? Again, the same as before. The ancients said, "One fall makes one wiser," but China becomes less and less prosperous after each fall. Is it that the minds of the Chinese people are particularly different from others? However, one commemoration, two commemorations, three or four commemorations, and constantly commemorating like this, there will always be one biggest commemoration, in other words, the last commemoration. If it really comes to this point, I am afraid that even if we want to commemorate it, we will not be able to.</p>
<p>Since the end of the European War, it has only been fifteen or sixteen years. At that time, Germany's military preparations and finances were controlled by the allied countries, and there was almost no chance of recovery. However, on the 6th, a Berlin dispatch stated that the German Minister of Defense, Schleicher, delivered a passionate speech during a military parade, saying that Germany could no longer tolerate being treated as a second-class country, and that East Prussia should be prepared to defend against danger. It can be seen that in more than ten years, Germany will fully restore its former military power. When I think of this, I cannot help but feel emotional.</p>

<h3>I Was Born Today</h3>
<p>— Yanghuaizhutang Zhuren</p>
<p>Five thousand years up and down, I was born today. Above is not the era of Tang and Yu, when sages are not born every generation. Below is not the era of Li and Zhao, when education has not been completely lost. Even in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, the disturbances were endless. However, there were disciples of Confucius who strived to be teachers of benevolence and righteousness. Although the princes were divided, the whole world was still one. King You joked by lighting the beacon fire, and the heroes fought to support him. They still knew to unite to resist the barbarians, and they wielded their spears in the same room. Heretical theories did not run rampant, although the strategists still used their skills. How would they know that now, people are advancing, and I am not necessarily. Western civilization emphasizes materialism, and if it is not guided by the Way of the King, it is still suspected of being unreal. What am I capable of now? The disease has become incurable. I have not learned from others' strengths, but only know to indulge in pride and idleness. Doctrines are also diverse, and it is difficult to distinguish the strange and bizarre. What is Marxism? Its wind is particularly cold. Although it inverts the cause and effect, it still has its merits. It confuses my youth, and they regard it as the first. To live in this world is unparalleled in difficulty since ancient times. Moreover, those in power still slander and envy each other. They fight among themselves, willing to be the oyster and the snipe. The powerful neighbor is watching covetously, and the pressure is getting closer and closer. If we do not quickly seek self-rescue, who will mourn when the country is destroyed? Today is indeed difficult and dangerous, but I was born today.</p>

<h3>Talking About Aquatic Fertilizers</h3>
<p>— Man · Qian ·</p>
<p>Nutrients Needed by Plants We know that plants need ten kinds of nutrients when they grow: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potassium, iron, and sulfur. Especially phosphoric acid, potassium (kali), and nitrogen (　) are the three most important elements. Phosphoric acid and potassium are necessary components in the formation of plant cells. If these two elements are lacking, cells cannot proliferate. Nitrogen is an indispensable element in the composition of proteins and other organic substances in plants. Therefore, if the supply is not sufficient, crops will be difficult to develop.</p>
<p>The Composition of Aquatic Fertilizers In aquatic fertilizers, these three elements are mostly complete. For example, oilseed cake and herring cake contain a lot of nitrogen.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Cake and whalebone, cod bone, etc. contain a lot of phosphoric acid. Generally, algae contain potassium fertilizers. Therefore, if it can be manufactured using scientific principles, it can be said to be the best. However, it must be noted that aquatic animals and plants are generally used for food, industry, and medicine. If they are specially used for manufacturing fertilizers, it is too uneconomical. Therefore, unless it is during times of abundant fishing and sluggish sales, or when low-value, lean fish are used as raw materials, the rest are by-products of edible and chemical products, which are properly processed or mixed with other items to make fertilizer.</p>
<p>Types of Aquatic Fertilizers Because the manufacturing methods are different, they can be divided into the following five types: (1) Dry fertilizer (2) Pressed fertilizer (3) Chemically processed fertilizer (4) Mixed fertilizer (5) Miscellaneous fertilizer</p>
<p>Manufacturing Methods of Various Fertilizers (1) Dry fertilizer is made by taking the whole or part of fish and shellfish and drying them. However, the raw materials must be fresh and contain less fat. (2) Pressed fertilizer is made by cooking fish and shellfish, pressing to separate the fat and water, and then drying them. This effect is more significant than the first type, because cooking can coagulate the protein, which will not easily cause corruption during storage. The decomposition of the fertilizer components follows the melting of fat, the pressure of water, and the drying of the product, which is relatively easy. Furthermore, when used in the future, it will not cause the decomposition of fertilizer components to be slow due to the large amount of fat present. Furthermore, the pressed-out fish oil is a useful by-product. This is called killing two birds with one stone. (3) Chemically processed fertilizer is made using chemical methods. Many aquatic fertilizers can be made using chemical methods, such as whale bones, dolphin bones, fish bones, shells, and algae. However, at present, we are focusing on promoting domestic products and respecting national survival.</p>
<p>This raw material is made into fertilizer, but it is just pulverized and dried. In fact, because of the backwardness of our country's science, we simply do not use chemical methods. How can we expect it to have good results and high prices? It is just a fool's dream. (4) Mixed fertilizer is made by mixing fish intestines, blood, etc. with charcoal and soil. (5) Miscellaneous fertilizer includes everything besides the four types mentioned above, such as all kinds of fish and shellfish, algae, lime, and brine, without special manufacturing, all belong to this category.</p>

<h3>Supplement on Reforming the Evils of Early Marriage</h3>
<p>— Wen · Bing ·</p>
<p>After reading the article "Hu Jun's Proposal to Reform the Evils of Early Marriage" in today's (6th) newspaper, I found it to be thorough and reasonable, and highly relevant to current abuses. In admiration, I would like to add a few points. I have written this article and posted it in this column with the aim of "attracting jade."</p>
<p>Hu Jun did not provide sufficient details on the causes of early marriage, so I will add a few points and delve into the root causes. There are four reasons for the formation of the bad habit of early marriage in China:</p>
<p>(1) Because Chinese society is dominated by the natural environment, and there have been few historical figures to drive the wheels of history, the past four thousand years, although dynasties have changed, have been a long night of tumbling in the feudal whirlpool. The unit that makes up this social collective is the family. Whether a family can occupy a superior position in society depends on the number of members. This has invisibly promoted early marriage and early childbirth among the general population, in the hope that their descendants will flourish and bring honor to the family.</p>
<p>(2) Because the economic structure of feudal society is simple, it is relatively easy to make a living. This makes people less burdened by marriage and family, which is also a reason for early marriage.</p>
<p>(3) Due to the above two reasons, people have gradually come to value the number of children and grandchildren when evaluating someone. The so-called "many children, many blessings," "people are wealth," and "early birth of a noble son" have become common congratulatory remarks. Thus, those who have children at a young age have developed a yearning for "holding grandchildren," and unmarried men and women also regard early marriage and early childbirth as an honor.</p>
<p>(4) There is also a very important reason, which is that science is underdeveloped and education is not widespread in China. People are generally unaware of the harm of early marriage. Therefore, everyone blindly follows customs, regardless of results or disadvantages, and the trend has been established for a long time.</p>
<p>Based on the above four reasons, the bad habit of early marriage in China has been formed today. Hu Jun has listed the resulting abuses in great detail, so I will not repeat them. What I still want to say is how to implement reforms in the future.</p>
<p>To prescribe the right medicine for the disease, my humble opinion is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Legal aspects: The legal authorities of each responsible area should strictly formulate provisions and conduct marriage registration. Men under the age of 20 and women under the age of 18 should be absolutely prohibited from marrying. If anyone violates the legal age and secretly marries, they should be heavily fined once discovered.</p>
<p>(2) Educational aspects: In middle schools and above, a course on marriage research should be added, with one hour of instruction per week. People with in-depth research should be hired to teach the course, using scientific methods to reason with students. In addition, courses such as physiology and hygiene should also pay attention to this and discuss it at any time, so that students can all clearly understand the advantages and disadvantages, and take the lead in advocating and reforming early marriage.</p>
<p>(3) Journalistic aspects: For any social news caused by early marriage, such as suicide due to financial difficulties caused by early marriage, or the weakening of the physical constitution of men and women and premature death, or the weakness and premature death of children born as a result, news reporters should explain in detail and inform the public to serve as a warning to those who come later.</p>
<p>(4) Private aspects: All private individuals who are already aware should lead by example and never indulge in early marriage. They should also make vigorous written or oral publicity at any time and in any place, so that those who see and hear them can be subtly influenced and deeply understand the harm of early marriage.</p>
<p>Of the four methods listed above, except for (1), which is passive, the remaining three are all active measures, which are easy to implement and effective.</p>
<p>If this problem can be solved according to law, it will not only benefit individual private individuals, but will also have a great relationship with the strength of the nation and the country. Worthy scholars and great men, why not discuss it in detail!</p>
<p>A Letter</p>
<h3>Love Letter</h3>
<p>— From Me</p>
<p>My dearest Ya Meng:</p>
<p>I received your third letter from Yuguan while I am ill. Ya Meng! Do you know that the Ying you care about was still seriously ill yesterday? Ah! Although my temperature is very high, I have never for a moment forgotten the love you have given me, and that you are waiting for my news in the midst of your long journey. However, Ya Meng! Do you know that the cruel doctors would not allow me to write to you no matter what? I am merely struggling to get up in pain, suffering the nurses' repeated prohibitions.</p>
<p>In fact, Ya Meng! I have simply lost the strength to hold a pen. I can guess that if you saw my thin arms, you would surely be heartbroken and shed tears. However, my spirit is very healthy, which should put my dear Ya Meng at ease. Isn't that so? As long as my spirit does not die, I will always be blessing you!</p>
<p>Ya Meng! I am sick! When I am in extreme pain, I often sadly murmur: | Ya Meng! Come back! Where are you? Why don't you come to see me? Your visit could cure me! ::: Heavens! Where have you taken my darling? Can't you let me see him once more before I die?</p>
<p>Ah! I shout like this, of course you won't hear me, but the people in the same ward as me sigh because of my madness. And my classmate Sister Ping once wiped away my tears and said:</p>
<p>| Don't be like this, you must understand that your husband is a fighter for the Chinese nation, and the death of a nation is much more important than your illness: besides, he doesn't even know you're sick right now.</p>
<p>I stared blankly at her trembling lips, and I felt infinite shame. Afterward, she also said:</p>
<p>| You should think like this, you should forgive your husband with such endurance.</p>
<p>So I could only hide my face and cry to my heart's content, because I couldn't be like a child clinging to an anti-imperialist revolutionary!</p>
<p>Today I reread your letter twice, and with each reading, a new and profound sense of kindness is etched in my heart. Only your every word can comfort my lonely heart, and make my confidence in you infinitely stronger.</p>
<p>In your letter, I am confused by the sound of cannons outside the Great Wall, and the "Imperial Army's" attack on Jehol makes me grit my teeth in hatred for the brutality of Japanese imperialism and tremble. You say your body is very strong, but I can imagine that your body is very tired. As for your spirit, it is certainly happy, because I believe that your career will bring you endless comfort. Although our separation will make you feel lonely, it will certainly not affect your great faith, will it? My Ya Meng! I now fully understand that we must fight for the oppressed nations and put love aside. We cannot wait for the imperialists to carve us up while enjoying the flowers and the moon; moreover, your wife is sincerely looking forward to your success, and this encouragement of love can at least give you considerable help.</p>
<p>Furthermore: we are a loving couple, and also revolutionary companions. I don't have the opportunity to go with you, but how can I make you slacken your work for my sake? We know and believe: we must never damage our inherent ideas because of love, because the shaking of shared ideas is tantamount to destroying our own love. My dear comrade! Listen, we must always be firm in our will, and not begin to damage our love! Ya Meng! A true revolutionary will never be burdened by children: do you believe this?</p>
<p>But, Ya Meng! I am, after all, a woman, and when I am seriously ill, I still long for you to return immediately. Now I have soberly overcome my emotions, and I have awakened to my responsibility to you. As for the cries of illness written above, you should understand that they are morbid and will not evoke your sentiment. Then why should I confess to you in this way? This is because of my purity towards you and I cannot hide anything.</p>
<p>The doctor is forbidding me to write any further, so I will stop here.</p>
<p>The doctor tells me that I can be discharged from the hospital in a week, and I am truly happy, please be happy for me.</p>
<p>The sound of rain outside the window is pattering, and my heart is both desolate and excited. I sincerely wish you kill! kill! kill! Kill all the enemies and return covered in blood!</p>
<p>From your patient, Ying</p>
<p>X month X day in the third-class ward.</p>
