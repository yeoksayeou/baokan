<h3 id="c1">國際形勢之展變　翰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近三日來。國際形勢。似有展變之兆。據二十二日倫敦路透社電（法政府已改變其對中日之遠東政策將抛棄其對於日本行爲之幕後扶助而堅守國聯會章。）同日巴黎路透社電又謂。（法國始終擁護國聯於遠東條約權利之决議。對於東三省。從未有與美國意見不同之處。故目前並無所謂法。故</p>
<p>國傾向美國之問題。）斯三電也。同爲路透所拍。一則發自倫敦。一則發自巴黎。前後語氣。頗堪研究倫敦電之表示。顯然爲法國遠東政策有所改變。而巴黎電之解釋則可以作對於從前袒日之欵謗有所辯白解。亦可以作法國對於遠東政策並未改變解。然則改變政策云云。果爲眞確之報告乎。抑係虚構之流言乎。法國之遠東政策。究將何如。斯誠最堪注意之問題。</p>
<p>最近美參議員李德赴歐。聞曾與法密議。（美對戰債問題。允攷慮法國之立塲。法對中日問題。亦望維美國之立塲。）以戰債問題與中日問題繫成一大連環。而使法國對於遠東政策之展變。傾向美國。此法國遠東政策改變之説。其可能一也。德國提出軍備均等要求後。表同情者有意俄。法處境至窘。即使英有助法抑德意究難解脱其隱憂。計惟有尋一有力之與國。而斯有力之與國。舍新大陸之盟主外。其誰是求。此法國遠東政策改變之説。其可能二也。過去法對中日問題。態度至不明瞭。察其内幕。法日之關係。似爲日本對於軍縮問題擁護法國之主張。而法國對於中日問題。則不妨礙日本之行動。其實法國在遠東。僅有殖民地之利益。祇須日本之行動與其殖民地之利益不發生衝突。則法國亦可視若無覩。今者日已承認僞國。且堅决宣言若報告不利於日。則日必退出國聯。法國對付德國之軍備要求。則惟以國聯會章之遵守爲答而於日本對國聯之恫嚇。將處何種態度。實一至難之問題。此法國對於遠東政策不得不有所改變。其可能三也。</p>
<p>雖然。法國遠東政策之改變。其眞可信而無疑乎。美對戰債問題。若允攷慮法國之立塲則美國至少須準備類於勾銷戰債之大犧牲。斯一大犧牲。其可以實現乎。其可以在短時間内實現乎。在美總統未改選。前殊置答。是則美法提携之説。斯時猶未可信也。法冀美且法以抑德。惟美亦欲法减縮軍備爲攷慮戰債之前提。法於目前軍備之維持。視爲安全之生命線。已歷次聲明在前。斯爲法美根本難以接近之點。斯點而一日未能除去。則法美提携之説。亦一日不可信。法國對於中日問題之態度。始終推諉於國聯。而國聯則始終運用其延宕之手段截至斯時恐法國尙未有改變其旣定政策之必。要是則法美提携之説。更可懷疑矣。</p>
<p>惟路透電訊。風來空穴。豈無因緣。據二十二日巴黎國民社電。日俄有相親之説。日本擬購用俄油而不再用美油。蓋自美國决議以艦隊之大部份集中夏威夷後。日本頗有戒心。他方面俄國對於（滿洲國。）擬成立妥約云云。日俄親善之説。與法美提携之説。不先不後。遙遙相對。恐非偶然之事實。曩者俄美親善之説。甚囂塵上。而日俄關係。則時而緊張。時而弛緩。尤令人不可捉摸。惟俄向有與日訂不侵犯條約之願。祗須西伯利亞有磐石之安。則雖以（僞圖）爲緩衝。於俄國目前之利害上打算。亦未始不可。故日俄關係之接近。亦非駭人聽聞之事。日俄果實現親善。則日可對英法諸强表示恫嚇。意若曰。如英法美聯合一致。則日本將聯合俄國以對付之。由斯而觀。則法美接近之説。亦不可謂爲無因也。</p>
<p>我國在此國際形勢展變之際。外交之運用。究有何種準備耶。各國之外交專家領袖正在奔走聯絡鈎心鬭角。出其敏妙活潑之手。段以應付此變化莫</p>
<p>測之國際局勢。而爭最後勝利之一着。我國外交家應付之手段。又將何如。要電</p>

<p>之作、不可謂少、其正手抽球、亦少失誤、發球固其特長、每藉此得分、總之二人精神振作、工作吃緊、致使名將德孚與惠特甘拜下風、至於英國之敗、咎在惠特之不能如法泡製、每失衆望、德孚雄健如昔、時有傑作、其表演不在林邱之下、</p>
<p>連得兩盤　是賽繼初級單打决賽終了而起、德孚發球失利、林寳華發球獲勝、中華遂得兩局、後惠特與邱輪流發球、各得一局、英國鋒芒忽盛、林邱高球還送失當、反予對手以攔擊、英國得以五比三局佔優、中華頓告危急、幸德孚發球之局失利、林寳華發球之局獲勝、乃打出去路、成五比五、以後英國時佔先着、林邱平等之、七比七後、中華連加兩局、乃以九比七反敗爲勝、第二盤起、中華一路進展、頗見順利、球時向兩邊襲進、使敵不易招架、而林寳華之發球、每操勝利、結果以六比三勝、當最後一局競爭殊烈、平手者五次之多、或攔網、或高球、或高壓、各展所長精彩百出、惟德孚之發球、曾有三次雙誤致爲林邱所勝、</p>
<p>一失一得　前兩盤林邱精神振作、爲所欲爲得心應手、精彩百出、以爲不難一氣呼成、以直落三勝、詎知第三盤開始林邱竟一變前狀、反覺精神暗淡、每况愈下、以一比六失敗、乃再接再厲於第四盤之競爭、一氣作成四比一局、但以下林寳華發球之局竟以滑四敗北德孚發球之局、林邱時送高球、但近在網前、致被對方攻擊機會、乃成四比三、又成四、比四形勢忽又平均、林邱奪回惠特發賣之一局再居優先、下局爲林發球、觀衆咸拍手迎之、預祝其成功、果然不負衆望、以六比四竟全功、奪得錦標、</p>

<p>維護航權</p>
<p>已在籌備</p>
<p>華商輪局、向以招商·三北·寗紹·三公司、規模最大、營業亦較巨、近年江海各路内、小規模之輪公司、日漸增多、約計有四十餘家、類皆路綫無定班次不常、隨時隨地、裝運客貨、今年一二八戰事發生、銀錢業愼重放欵、各處客帮、均减少辦貨、航業界影響最大、加以東北被日强占、航權失落、國輪將不能暢行、航運範圍、益形縮小、華商航業、尤有一蹶不振之勢、本埠航會主席陳伯剛·虞洽卿等、爲挽救國輪維護航權起見、遂實行國輪聯合大同盟藉以抵禦外輪之侵佔、記者聞訊、特赴各方面詳加調查、爰將大槪狀况、報告如下、</p>
<p>聯盟原因　本埠華商輪局、大小四十餘家、除一部有固定路綫及班期者外、餘皆規模狹小、僅有一二商輪、並無行航綫、類多臨時派班、裝運客貨、每有數船競駛一地、因爭儎而濫跌水脚、營業被其搗亂、運率爲之破壞、今年各地缺貨、航運一落千丈、滬上數十家國輪中、僅中威與大通兩公司、營業較優、自僞國與日本訂約後、國輪航路益蹙、本埠航會主席陳伯剛虞洽卿等、協議挽救華輪業之清淡、决將全體聯盟合作入手、</p>
<p>團結辦法　陳虞二氏提出國輪聯合、主張營業公開、勿使再有畸輕重之激烈競爭、業由陳氏將此項主旨、向全體會員陳述、各公司均表示同情、此項團結辦法、大致使各輪局聯合一起、併所有之全部商、輪按照各船原行路綫、然後由聯合辦事處公同支配、務使平均、酌盈劑虚、俾運費一律、不許再擅自漲趺、其營業仿滬台綫内六公司之聯安航局辦法處理之、庶可維持久遠、</p>
<p>保持航權　國輪大同明盟成立後、可泯同業自行内爭、運率客脚亦告統一、班次固定、更可免有貨無輪、或船多貨缺之慮、於客家亦多利便、而於本國之江海各路、均可支配船行、以杜洋商輪之覬覦侵奪、各埠抵制仇輪之國貨、均可由國輪承運、此舉於保持航權、亦至爲重大也、此事現由陳君主持籌辦中、不久可以告成、</p>
<p>水脚問題　關於水脚收現問題、滬上各輪公司、議定九月十六日起、客貨運費、一律繳現、至多十日期票不再記帳、曾記本報但此事宣佈後、各報關行一致反對、拒絕付現、連日各輪公司爲此事與報關行磋商之下、依報關業須四十五天期付欵、而輪公司公議之下、已酌量讓步、改爲二十五天期付納、現時尙在討論、大約將以一個月期爲决定云、</p>

<p>糖漿木桶中夾烟土嗎啡</p>
<p>海關抄獲後正在澈究中</p>
<p>招商局行駛長江一帶之江大輪、此次由漢開滬、於前日抵埠詎當晚起卸貨物時、因碼頭癟三圖竊貨物突然發現該輪運來之糖漿木桶中、夾帶大批烟土及巨額嗎啡、經人秘報海關會、同法捕房中西探捕、在金利源十六號貨棧中、查獲大糖桶五十三只、除兩桶完全滿裝糖漿外、其餘五十一桶内中悉數夾帶嗎啡烟土、當經如數截留、暫存海關棧房、現正澈查運土主犯、茲將詳情探錄於後、</p>
<p>發現烟土　江大輪於前日上午十時抵滬、停泊法租界外灘金利源碼頭、貨物至下午三時一刻、方始卸完、悉數囤入第十六號貨棧中、當時忽有碼頭癟三多人、將多數木桶之一、用鐵器撬開、發現桶内夾帶烟土、經人察覺、遂密往海關報告、</p>
<p>海關查扣　海關據報後立卽派大隊抄關員會同捕、房中西探捕赶往檢查、果然抄獲糖桶内全裝烟土、遂悉數扣留、共計有五十三桶之多、除兩桶純粹滿裝糖漿外、其餘三十九桶、每桶均夾帶烟土二十斤、尙有十二桶爲嗎啡、兩共值洋一百五十萬左右、點明後、當卽逐運至海關棧房暫存、</p>
<p>查無貨主　案發後海關查閲五十三桶之嘜頭Ｐ·Ｅ·Ｈ·Ｔ·裝來提貨之客人並無名</p>
<p>號、係用來人提單、故究屬何人之物、無從澈查、加之販土人心頗機巧、若輩深知長江一帶、素非産糖區域、而假扮客人退貨、以冀蒙蔽檢查者之耳目、初固不料因癟三之行竊、而功敗垂成也、</p>
<p>冒領獎金　自是案發生後、社會揣測紛紜、有謂當該項烟土嗎啡自宜昌運至漢口時、卽有眼線假扮旅客、同乘江大輪追踪而下、迨輪抵南京、該眼線卽先行豋陸、搭乘京滬火車潛行來滬卽向海關告密惟是否屬實尙難臆料、但昨日竟有人逕赴海關冀圖領取十分之三之獎金、當時海關爲愼重起見、特向領獎人詰問運來之嘜頭、察其是否、符合而領獎人竟瞠目不能對、因是海關未曾照給、</p>
<p>輪局查究　記者鑒於本案之關係重大、特向各方詳加探訪、但該項烟土究屬何人所運、終詳確息、或謂主運者係一劉姓、内容係由二十餘大股、聯組而成、此番運滬、已第三四次云云、昨據招商局負責人宣稱、對於該項烟土、因有報裝之客家、及提單等各種來源、該局全不負責、聞已向漢口究查報裝客家、眞相不難自白云、</p>
<p>西報紀載　字林報云、海關職員昨在法租界抄獲大宗烟土、價值當在二十五萬至五十萬元之間、計共五十桶、約重一百四十五擔、卽六噸之鉅、當由法租界與公共租界巡捕先後護送至海關禁品庫房、此項烟土、似係數日前自漢口運來、混報爲糖、運交本埠某銀行、當初不疑有他、故卽視同普通貨物、暫堆法租界關棧、迨昨日碼頭小工前往搬運、忽有一桶墜地裂開、烟土散落滿地、其外面固有糖一層、但烟土氣味、迅卽外溢、一小工首往檢視諸小工隨之、爭欲檢取、遂爲關員所悉、上前阻止、反被小工流氓所毆、乃急出報告法捕房與海關、迨巡捕趕到已有流氓百餘人在場聲勢洶洶、卒由巡捕驅散、並在土桶四周、派捕圍守、旣而海關抄班領袖史庫士率衆馳至、檢查之後、台悉全屬烟土、遂召汽車五六輛、分載五十桶、由法捕護送至洋涇浜、更由公共租界巡捕接護、運回海關、此項禁、品究係何輪裝運、昨夜猶未確悉、現海關當道、正在澈底偵查中、又據大陸報云、昨日下午海關當道在金利源碼頭破獲價值一百萬元之大宗烟土、共裝五十木桶、每桶約七百磅、係自江天輪卸下、某碼頭小工信以爲糖、破桶一角、意圖偷竊、遂發覺爲烟土、報告捕房、聞此項烟土、係自通州裝輪、估計共有四十三萬盎斯、以市價每盎斯二元四角計、所值不下一百萬元云云、</p>

<p>他和老牛已到了自已的家了，他把老黃牛照着天天如此的慣例纜在塲角上的那顆果子樹下，餧了些青草，轉身往裏走去，他還沒有進門，早見那小黑狗向着門内狂吠，他知道一定有個不是常來的生人在裏面，急忙進門一噍，原來是住在前面這村子裏當地保的徐家伯伯和兩個穿着制服的警士。</p>

<p>— ·佛</p>
<p>絕食是不吃飯，不吃麵包，這一種消極而無聊的辦法，不意近日居然如大廉價的風行一時，殊爲可怪，</p>
<p>我所不慬的，據醫生云，凡氣體强壯的人，如餓七日，必定要死，否則五日，若我輩素來吃飯不多的人，尤其餓不起，假定我絕食三日，一定要一命嗚呼，而據印度國民大會代理會長宣稱，甘地絕食，雖或可支持二十五日，但如絕食十日，則恐永無復原之望，而牛蘭夫婦，前日亦餓十餘日之久，而竟然不死，大約絕食亦有道歟，或曰，絕食祗不吃飯，不食麵包，而其餘諸物可吃，誠如是·則每日吃些牛乳鷄蛋等顃，似可永不餓死，絕食等於虚文，現在我旣不要絕食，且不必去研究他的絕食方法，可知天下事，多不易做，即就絕食一端，非有門檻者不能辦也，</p>
<p>但絕食雖風行一時，而其效力之大小，則逈乎有别，例如前日牛蘭夫婦，絕食十有餘日，而各要人中，有因主義關係，有因國際係，奔走營救，函電交馳，結果得以不死，且有特赦之望，此絕食之較爲有效者也，其次爲三友實業社的工友，因要求復工不遂，亦大家去絕食，結果非但不能達到目的，而反引起一般大企業家與中央民運指委會，在報紙上大打其筆墨官司，而結果一無所獲，昨據浦那電，自甘地絕食後，印人多開始絕食，藉對甘地與其政見，表示同情，又云，甘地今絕食入第三日，現在已微有希望，因瑣拉維亞今晨謁見甘地後宣稱，賤民參政權問題，今日定可得最後解决，如此則甘地之絕食，果有意想不到之效力歟，</p>
<p>我所更不解的，甘地爲人，除自已刻苦自勵外，亦並無何等驚人的偉績可言，惟雖在絕食時，每日紡紗與祈禱之常課，仍不爲輟，即此一端，而見甘地之刻苦耐勞，强毅不屈的精神，已完全表露，昔曾文正公讓在軍書旁午時正面每日一小時寫字工作，决不肯輟，到底建立殊功，今見甘地之絕食，而益認識偉人鎭靜的態度，與其建立偉功、非尋常徼倖可致　，耶穌自有道理也，</p>

<p>誰都知道酒精是澱粉製出來的、却沒有見過從木材裏也能夠製出酒精來。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>但是我們要曉得，以前一切不可能的事，現在不都是司空見慣了嗎？木材製酒精，在最近的將來，也許要成爲很平常的事，是用不着驚奇的。因爲這不但是已經試騐成功，而成本又很低廉，是我國急需要製造的。所以將牠的製法，寫在下面：</p>
<p>木材製酒精，是利用一種化學作用而成功的。牠的製法，本有多種。其中的一種，就是先用個桶，滿盛極細的木屑，再將這木屑用蒸汽蒸一小時後，便將濃硫酸放在這木屑裏，使牠膨脹，就漸漸的變成澱粉體的糊狀化合特而溶解。次將這溶解液裏放入多量的冷水，熱至攝氏一百二十度時，便變爲葡萄糖。將這糖裏加入少量的鹼，俟中和後，再加入釀母菌使牠發酵後，然後將這溶液放在另一個有孔的桶裏，使液體流下，這流下的液體就是酒精。另一種方法，是將木屑裏放入稀硫酸，熱至很高的温度時，牠便變爲葡萄糖，再將這糖用上面同樣的方法製造，牠也就可以變爲酒精了。</p>
<p>除了上面這兩種方法外，還有一種方法，就是用强鹽酸來處理木材。當强鹽酸放入木材裏時，木材中的纖維素受了强鹽酸的作用，便變爲葡萄糖，再由這糖裏也可製出酒精來。</p>
<p>木材何以能製酒精呢？這是因爲木材主要的成分是纖維素，纖維素是由澱粉凝集而成的。若將酸類的東西，放入這纖維素裏，便起化學的作用，變成葡萄糖，再由這糖裏製出酒精，是很容易的事啊。</p>

<p>— ·薦·樓·樓</p>
<p>在這樣人浮於事的龐大社會上，人才對於職位，眞是絕對的求過於供，追求麵包的旣與日俱增，而供給麵包的却祗日見其少，因此一般雇用主對於服務人員的選擇和取用，也便不得不（以質限量）的拿資格來作消極的限制，於是資格的獲得，便儼然成爲謀事的先决條件，除了大人物的援引提植，和拿財力來攢營等，儘可無需資格而穩得優越的位置外，就是一碗吃不飽的苦飯，似乎也必需具有某種資格，才挨得着份兒，</p>
<p>在現在，差不多上自行政官署，至一般公務機關，以逮普通的較大的公司商店，已多半把資格當作取捨人才的準的，有些地方，簡直拿資格來定職位的高下，和薪給的多寡，例如我國著名的某大印書館，對職員顯然以博士·碩士·國外留學生，和國内學畢業，以及專校畢業等等，分成各級，以定薪額，不能越雷池一步，無形中標榜着（無資格者勿和我門）的禁令，可是這裏所謂資格，却成了狹義化而僅指學位而言了。</p>
<p>在此我又聯想起我國的考試制度了，揆諸考試的原義，當然應以擢取眞才實學爲主旨，可是在事實上却適得其反，往往在招考的規程上，開頭就明白規定了應試者的資格，而以審查學位，檢騐文憑，爲考試的第一步手續，祇要資格合符，查核及格，即可埋虎過去，至於學識經騐如何，儘可不問，而所謂口試筆試等等項目，却祗等具文而已，例如我國的律師，依據明文規定，例須經過正式考試，才能獲得律師證書，執行職務，可是統觀全國數千律師，正式經過考試的殆絕無僅有，因爲祗須取得一張國外大學或國内立案法校的畢業證書，便可以亨受（甄拔）的優遇，茲姑不論甄拔制度顯與考試制度大相扞格，而在甄拔的標幟下，一般混得資格者，都得安然濫竽，反之一般畢生精究法學的眞實學者，却因不合甄拔的規程，而永遠被摒於淘汰之列，這能説是一種公允的辦法麽。</p>
<p>雖然，我們細繹（資格）的原義，本來賅有兩重意義，（資）是一種内質的條件，指眞實的學識經騐而言，（格）是一種外形的條件，指學位文憑及任事履歷等等而言，所以談資格者，自應兩者兼顧，勿容偏頗，而選擇人才，在必要時寗取資而捨格，和符擇才的眞義　，可是在現代社會上，能資格俱備者，委實什不得一，於是有格無資者儘量充塞於社會，並且隨處佔了大便宜，而有資無格者却成了一個被唾棄者，到處碰壁，記得（生活）上某君曾大喊（吃盡了資格的虧），我們知道在這浩渺的人間，與某君同病的正不知有凡幾咧。</p>
<p>我覺得這是一個很值得注意的問題，現社會的（輕資重格），實是一種捨本逐未的病態，而有亟待改革的必要，本欄專以改良社會爲職志，因敢拉雜發表鄙見，不過關於改革的方案，個人識見有限，未敢率爾擅擬，深冀薄海同文，能來其同的商榷一下，裨能獲得一個正確而能實行的解决方法，那是拙作（抛磚引玉）的本意了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Transformation of the International Situation by Han <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In the past three days, the international situation seems to have shown signs of change. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd, "The French government has changed its Far Eastern policy towards China and Japan, abandoning its behind-the-scenes support for Japan's actions and adhering to the League of Nations charter." A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the same day also stated, "France has consistently supported the League of Nations' resolutions on treaty rights in the Far East. It has never disagreed with the United States on the issue of the Northeast Three Provinces. Therefore, there is currently no issue of France leaning towards the United States." These three dispatches, all from Reuters, one from London and one from Paris, have quite different tones, worthy of study. The London dispatch clearly indicates a change in France's Far Eastern policy, while the Paris dispatch's explanation can be interpreted as a clarification of past accusations of pro-Japanese bias, or as France not having changed its Far Eastern policy. Is the report of a policy change a true account, or a fabricated rumor? What will France's Far Eastern policy ultimately be? This is truly a question that deserves the most attention.</p>
<p>Recently, U.S. Senator Reed went to Europe and reportedly held secret talks with France, "The U.S. may consider France's position on the war debt issue, and France is expected to maintain the U.S. position on the China-Japan issue." The war debt issue and the China-Japan issue are linked into a large chain, causing France's Far Eastern policy to change and lean towards the United States. This is one possibility for the change in France's Far Eastern policy. After Germany raised the demand for equal armaments, Russia intentionally expressed sympathy, putting France in a very difficult situation. Even if Britain helps France to restrain Germany and Italy, it will still be difficult to escape its hidden worries. The only solution is to find a powerful allied country, and who else to seek but the leader of the New World? This is the second possibility for the change in France's Far Eastern policy. In the past, France's attitude towards the China-Japan issue was very unclear. Looking into its inner workings, the relationship between France and Japan seemed to be that Japan supported France's position on disarmament issues, while France did not obstruct Japan's actions on the China-Japan issue. In fact, France only has colonial interests in the Far East. As long as Japan's actions do not conflict with its colonial interests, France can also turn a blind eye. Now that Japan has recognized the puppet state and resolutely declared that if the report is unfavorable to Japan, Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations, France can only respond to Germany's armament demands by adhering to the League of Nations charter. What attitude will France take towards Japan's threat to the League of Nations? This is truly a difficult question. This is the third possibility for France to change its Far Eastern policy.</p>
<p>However, is the change in France's Far Eastern policy truly credible and beyond doubt? If the U.S. agrees to consider France's position on the war debt issue, then the U.S. must at least be prepared for a major sacrifice similar to writing off the war debt. Can this major sacrifice be realized? Can it be realized in a short period of time? It is difficult to answer before the U.S. presidential election. Therefore, the idea of U.S.-French cooperation is still not credible at this time. France hopes that the U.S. will restrain Germany, but the U.S. also wants France to reduce its armaments as a prerequisite for considering war debts. France regards the maintenance of its current armaments as the lifeline of its security, and has repeatedly stated this in the past. This is a fundamental point of difficulty for the U.S. and France to approach. As long as this point is not removed for a single day, the idea of U.S.-French cooperation will not be credible for a single day. France has always pushed responsibility for the China-Japan issue to the League of Nations, and the League of Nations has always used its means of delay. Until this time, I am afraid that France has not yet had the necessity to change its established policy. If this is the case, then the idea of U.S.-French cooperation is even more questionable.</p>
<p>However, Reuters telegrams do not come from nowhere. According to a dispatch from the Parisian National Society on the 22nd, there is talk of amity between Japan and Russia. Japan intends to purchase Russian oil and no longer use American oil, because Japan has become wary since the United States decided to concentrate the majority of its fleet in Hawaii. On the other hand, Russia plans to conclude an agreement regarding the "Manchukuo." The talk of Japanese-Russian friendship and the talk of French-American cooperation, one before the other, are remotely related, and are probably not accidental facts. In the past, the talk of Russian-American friendship was rampant, while the relationship between Japan and Russia was sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, making it even more difficult to grasp. However, Russia has always had the desire to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan. As long as Siberia is safe as a rock, then even using the "puppet map" as a buffer is not impossible from the perspective of Russia's current interests. Therefore, the rapprochement between Japan and Russia is not an unheard-of thing. If Japan and Russia achieve friendship, then Japan can express threats to Britain, France, and other powers, as if to say, if Britain, France, and the United States unite, then Japan will unite with Russia to deal with them. From this perspective, the idea of French-American rapprochement cannot be said to be without cause.</p>
<p>At this time of transformation in the international situation, what kind of preparations does our country have for diplomatic operations? Diplomatic experts and leaders from various countries are running around, contacting each other, and engaging in intrigue, using their clever and agile methods to deal with this unpredictable international situation, and striving for the final victory. What will be the means of our country's diplomats? Key telegram.</p>

Suddenly, an airplane arrived, scattering leaflets containing earnest language, urging the puppet state's army to defect. The rebel troops were besieged on all sides, and a portion defected to Ma Zhanshan. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the rebel troops ordered a retreat, concentrating in the suburbs of Harbin. The arsenal caught fire, and plainclothes troops were discovered at the slaughterhouse. The southeastern suburbs of Harbin seem to have fallen into the hands of the Self-Defense Forces, causing great chaos in the city. Rumors spread that Russian troops would mobilize. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Beijing: On the morning of the 20th, the righteous army under Zhang Mingwu and Wang Xianting clashed with Japanese troops for ten hours between Huating Village and Wofosi Temple in the northwest of Jin County.

<p>Harbin: According to local newspaper reports, the anti-Manchu army has won a great victory, approaching Harbin and carrying out encirclement operations, no more than seven miles from the city. However, the Japanese military authorities are both refuting rumors and actively defending. Yesterday and today, they have been installing barbed wire everywhere, especially focusing on the new city. Russian newspapers report that the anti-Manchu army has recovered Shuangcheng Township near Shuangchengpu, and is now advancing on Shuangchengpu with 3,000 men. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Harbin: The anti-Manchu army has cut the railway near Satu (transliteration), one hundred li west of Harbin, so trains cannot pass through again. According to Japanese sources, yesterday a thousand anti-Manchu soldiers attacked Anda, entering the city through the south gate. Japanese military police and (Manchukuo) troops are still resisting. Japanese reinforcements have rushed from Qiqihar to help. Shuangcheng County, 31 li south of Harbin, was once occupied by volunteer soldiers, but after a joint attack by Japanese and (Manchukuo) troops, the city was retaken after two hours of fighting. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Beijing: The Japanese side has decided to transfer elite troops to northern Harbin to attack Ma Zhanshan, and to dispatch another 10,000 elite troops to search and destroy righteous armies in various places, scheduled to be implemented in early October. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>

They also sometimes use air force intimidation, distributing leaflets, or Japanese soldiers going to various villages to promote and fool the villagers. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Beijing: Han's infantry regiment and pistol team under Cao Fulin landed near Longkou on the morning of the 23rd. Liu's army only left a battalion to guard, and immediately retreated to Huang County. Most of them were ordered to go to Laizhou for combat. The area has now been taken over by the Northeast Navy and Han's army. The Dengzhou Marine Corps has also landed to maintain order. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Beijing: When Liu Zhennian's vanguard was in Laizhou, it declared war on Han's army, and built trenches in Zhaoyuan, Qixia, Laiyang, and Muping, planning to take the opportunity to break through Han's encirclement strategy. Liu himself is still commanding operations on the front line. Although Han has ordered a ceasefire, the Zhang Luanji Brigade of Liu's army guarding Yexian launched an attack on the provincial army from the southeast. At the same time, the mortar team at the Huoshen Temple in the south gate shelled the Han army's positions. Han's Rong and Li brigades also fiercely counterattacked, and besieged and disarmed a brigade of Liu's army, escorting them to the rear.

<p>Qingdao: Liu's army in Yantai withdrew completely on the evening of the 23rd. Marine Corps from the Northeast Navy's Zhaohe, Haichen, and Jiangli ships landed at 6:00 a.m. on the 24th. Captain Wang of the Zhaohe issued a notice to temporarily maintain local security. The landing of the marines was met with no resistance and no shots were fired. This matter is of great importance. According to Chinese speculation, the purpose is to occupy Yantai and its income, and Liu Zhennian's failure can also be verified. One point should not be ignored, namely that the landing of the Marine Corps has the possibility of preventing Han Fuju from expanding his sphere of influence. The current order in Yantai is excellent. Machine guns are placed outside the HSBC Bank for protection. The Chinese seem to welcome this incident. All shops are flying flags to welcome the Marine Corps. There are no troops in Yantai, which is a relief. The Liu army stationed in Yantai left at night with Brigade Commander Li, who told Reuters reporters that they were heading to the base in Qixia, about 55 miles southwest of here. It is heard that the Marine Corps also landed in Dengzhou. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Yantai: The landing of the Chinese Marine Corps and the withdrawal of the garrison seem to be a harbinger of Han's army occupying this territory. But judging from the phenomenon, the provincial army has not yet advanced sharply, and there is no news from the war zone. However, according to reports from Chinese warships in Longkou, the port is still peaceful, which proves that Han's army cannot deeply advance from Pinglidian. It is heard that there is no change on the Laiyang front. Although Liu Zhennian's whereabouts are unknown, reliable sources now believe that Liu is still resisting Han Fuju in Laizhou. Yantai can be safely secured. Captain Zhaohe of the cruiser Zhaohe told Chief Consul Wei Bai of the American Consulate General that he had sent the Marine Corps, carrying quick-firing guns, to station in all important points of the territory, so that foreign troops would not have the opportunity to raid. He also said that he and the 650 marines who landed were willing to temporarily take responsibility for protecting the territory. According to long-distance telephone calls from Dengzhou this morning, everything is peaceful. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Yantai: Judging from the phenomenon, Liu's army is now retreating rapidly towards Qixia, where Liu has prepared a huge amount of military supplies, probably intending to hold out for a long time. Qixia is about forty miles southwest of Yantai, and is almost entirely surrounded by mountains. It is extremely difficult to break through unless attacked from the sky, making it a truly excellent defensive position. Liu's headquarters has moved away from Yantai, and there are no traces of Liu's army on the motor road leading to Weixian, so it is currently very difficult to obtain accurate information on the war. However, the Yantai Chinese Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from Han Fuju today, saying that his troops will arrive in Yantai within two or three days. Han stated that he did not want to continue seeking armed conflict, so people here now speculate that there may be a possibility of mediation. It is said that after Liu Zhennian leaves Shandong, he will be given a position in Anhui Province. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Niuzhuang: Continuous heavy rain increases the hardship of the two kidnapped British nationals and also hinders the efforts of rescuers because the intermediary sent by the British Consulate to contact the bandits cannot return immediately due to the rain. Another person was sent this morning with a letter to see the bandits, urging them to send representatives to conduct negotiations as soon as possible. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The London Times reported in a telegram from Niuzhuang on the 24th that Japanese officials believe that the kidnapping of Mrs. Paure, a British national, was instigated by the Chinese authorities in Beiping. The Chinese government believes that this is purely a Japanese attempt to completely blame the Beiping authorities for its inability to protect foreigners in the three northeastern provinces in order to absolve itself of responsibility. In the future, similar incidents in Niuzhuang and other places in the three northeastern provinces will inevitably be attributed to the Beiping authorities. How ridiculous! Niuzhuang and other places in the three northeastern provinces are currently under Japanese military occupation. To blame the Beiping authorities for the kidnapping of foreigners is no different than saying that the Japanese earthquake should also be blamed on others. The people of Niuzhuang and other places in the three northeastern provinces cannot bear the harassment and oppression of the Japanese army and take risks, becoming bandits. Therefore, the presence of the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces is actually the cause of the creation of bandits, and at the same time, it has no ability to protect the lives and property of people inside and outside the region. It is merely trying to shirk its responsibility to the Beiping authorities, which is enough to expose its own weakness. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shenyang: The commander of the Niuzhuang (Manchukuo) army has sent a letter to the bandit leader, stating that if the two kidnapped British nationals are safely released immediately, no punishment will be imposed.

Muto's deputy has replied to the London Daily Express, stating that the Japanese military authorities are now making every effort to rescue the two, but they cannot use harsh methods, fearing that if pressed too hard, the bandits will kill the two. The Japanese military authorities hope that this matter can be satisfactorily resolved soon. He also stated that the bandit's kidnapping was clearly instigated by outside forces.

<p>The National News Agency’s dispatch from Leningrad on the 23rd states that the Soviet Russian Baltic Fleet is currently holding autumn exercises. The exercises are being personally reviewed by Military Affairs Commissioner Voroshilov aboard the battleship Marat. The exercise plan targets the attack on Leningrad and Kronstadt by enemy forces. All members of the Baltic Fleet are mobilized, with airships and aircraft playing an especially important role. This shows that this year's autumn exercises are by no means ordinary exercises. Russian newspaper commentaries regard this as a prelude to the expansion of the navy. Among the foreigners participating in the autumn exercises, the Italian Generals Nobai are the most prominent, and Zhanzhaonuo observed the aircraft designed and manufactured by himself.</p>

<h3 id="e70">League of Nations Council Yields to Japanese Request to Postpone Discussion of Investigative Report <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yan Huiqing Opposes in Vain Based on Legal Grounds</p>
<p>Decision to Publish Report on October 1st</p>
<p>Meeting to Study to be Held Six Weeks Later</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 24th states that the League of Nations Council met at 11 am this morning to discuss Iraq's admission to the League and China's request regarding the Three Eastern Provinces. The Council voted to approve Iraq's accession to the League since Britain's representation of that country has expired. Council President de Valera (leader of the Irish Free State) then spoke, saying that the Council could consider Japan's request for a postponement of the discussion, but before making a proposal, he had to express his regret that Japan had immediately recognized Manchukuo and signed a treaty with it without waiting for the discussion of the Lytton Report or even its publication. This move seriously hinders the resolution of this dispute. However, he now proposes to accept Japan's request in principle. As for what day the Council meeting will be convened several weeks later, it remains to be decided. Japanese representative Nagaoka said that Japan's request for a postponement of the discussion was out of practical necessity and asked the Council to consider the transportation situation between Japan and Europe and not to decide on a time that was too hasty. As for the recognition of Manchukuo, he is willing to wait for an appropriate time to criticize it. Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Yan then spoke, opposing the postponement, saying that Japan would take advantage of it and make the situation more serious. He does not understand why Japan needs to send a special commissioner to transmit instructions. If that person is lost on the way, will the discussion be postponed again? Japan has many personnel in Geneva, and telegrams are not obstructed. Therefore, China strongly opposes the postponement. Dr. Yan presented legal reasons to prove that the Council is not qualified to grant Japan's request and later suggested that the matter be referred to the Committee of Nineteen for review because only this committee has the right to review the matter. Dr. Yan also said that Japan has already benefited from the delay, expanding its occupation on 400,000 square miles of Chinese land, and the organs of customs, post offices, and salt revenue inspection offices have all been destroyed by it. The Chinese delegation received a telegram yesterday stating that Japan is preparing to send troops to invade Rehe. If it is delayed again, the danger will be very great. This matter should be resolved quickly and should not be delayed. President de Valera interjected, saying that he could not doubt whether China's opposition was justified. Although the Council's powers are limited by certain resolutions passed by the Assembly, the Council has the right to study the Lytton Report first and then submit it to the Assembly. Spanish representative Madariaga spoke, recognizing that prolonging the situation was indeed dangerous and denouncing Japan's recognition of Manchukuo, but supporting the President's proposal to postpone the meeting. Dr. Yan again opposed the Council's qualification to postpone the discussion of the matter based on legal grounds, but Dr. Yan ultimately failed to persuade the Council to follow his words. The meeting agreed in principle to postpone the meeting. Approximately November 21st may be the date for the Council to discuss the Three Eastern Provinces issue. The Council decided to publish the report of the Investigative Group on October 1st and to publish the map as soon as possible after October 1st. The full report and its attachments will also be sent to the Chinese and Japanese governments on October 1st. The Council also decided to meet on November 14th to study the report. Japanese representative Nagaoka made his last effort, hoping to extend the deadline slightly, using the reason that the floodwaters around Harbin had not receded. Nagaoka's words aroused laughter from the audience. The Council finally passed a resolution to meet on November 14th, but it allowed the President to extend the period again if he deemed it necessary, but by no more than two weeks. Therefore, the date for the Council to discuss the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces will be approximately November 24th at the latest.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Paul-Boncour's Speech Had Implicit Meaning <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>France's Pro-American and Anti-Japanese Expression</p>
<p>The National News Agency’s dispatch from Geneva on the 23rd states that it has recently been learned that League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond secretly reported to the Council that he had notified the Manchu puppet regime that it could not forward the two telegrams it had sent to the member states. These telegrams have now been placed in the archives. According to reports, the two telegrams sent by the puppet organization reported on the tax agreements and protocols it had signed with Japan. Moreover, during this short League of Nations Council meeting, although the Japanese request for a postponement of the discussion of the report was most noteworthy, there was another matter that was also of great concern to people in the League of Nations. According to recent rumors, France has slightly changed its policy toward the Far East. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, France had shown a pro-Japanese tendency, but recently, rumors have said that Paris' attitude has changed slightly. Generally, people believe that French Army Minister Paul-Boncour's speech to the Council on the South American-Bolivian dispute stated that when two countries bound by the League of Nations Covenant have a conflict, no matter where the conflict occurs on Earth, it must be regarded as a failure of the League of Nations. This is undoubtedly certain, and it can be used to corroborate the theory that France has changed its attitude. As for the reasons for France's shift, many believe that it is because Japan changed to contracting with Soviet Russia to supply gasoline, which aroused the desire to be friendly with the United States.</p>

<p>The Electric Communication dispatch from Tokyo on the 24th states that, according to a telegram from Geneva, five of the twelve vice-presidents of the League of Nations' regular general assembly, including the representatives of the permanent council members Britain, Japan, Belgium, France, and Italy, have traditionally been elected without competition. This time, a portion of the movement caused by the negative feelings regarding the Manchurian issue has made the election of the Japanese representative particularly noteworthy.</p>

<p>From Economic Cooperation to Political Compromise</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd Dispatch from the National News Agency: There is close attention here to the talks currently underway between the Japanese and Russian governments in Moscow. However, unlike observations in Paris and elsewhere, German diplomatic circles believe that, although both military and civilian factions in the Japanese and Russian governments experienced a brief period of unease following frequent unpleasant incidents near the Sino-Russian border, subsequent information obtained by the German side suggests that both sides are actively seeking to avoid conflict and to reach an understanding on all outstanding issues that could lead to conflict. This is clearly demonstrated by the recent agreement on fishery rights, which eliminated some disputes over the fishery rights issue that Japan values most. As for the claims in American and French newspapers that negotiations between Japanese industrialist Matsushita and the Soviet authorities have political undertones and implications for US-Japan relations, it is considered here that such claims are exaggerated. According to German political circles, Japan's desire to increase imports of Russian goods is a natural trend and has no political significance. After Japan increases its purchases of Russian goods, its domestic manufactured goods, which are urgently seeking outlets, can also increase sales in Russia. However, it is undeniable that increased economic cooperation will naturally affect political relations between the two countries, at least in terms of influencing Moscow's attitude toward the Manchurian issue.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th Dispatch from the China United News Agency: Tokyo received a telegram from Washington stating that the US is highly skeptical of reports that Russia will recognize the puppet state. According to observations by US diplomatic circles, the reasons for US Secretary of State Stimson's disregard for Russia are mainly as follows: (1) Stimson previously went to Geneva to exchange views with representatives from Britain, France, and Italy on the Far East issue. Soviet representative Litvinov requested a meeting, but was rejected, and the US has not changed its policy toward Russia, with US-Russian relations remaining as they were before. (2) The Sino-Russian border stretches for six hundred miles, and without cooperation with Japan and Manchukuo, it would be difficult to manage. The US is not cooperating with Russia, expecting to profit from a Russo-Japanese war. Russia is unwilling to fall into the US's trap. (3) Russia's Far East Five-Year Plan is underway and it does not want to provoke a conflict with Japan, preferring to wait until the plan is successful before preparing for a conflict with Japan. Currently, it can only bide its time. (4) Russia's prior recognition of the puppet organization would give it equal rights with Japan in diplomacy, making it easier to monitor Japan's actions and preventing Japan from immediately annexing Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>

<p>Believes Franco-Italian Harmony is Not Impossible</p>
<p>Peace is Difficult to Achieve with Unequal Armaments</p>
<p>Paris, 23rd Dispatch from the National News Agency: In a meeting yesterday with the Rome correspondent of the Republican newspaper, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini reiterated his call for peace and disarmament, refuting the theory that the French left-wing government cannot be friendly with the Italian Fascist government. Mussolini expounded on the concept of Fascism, saying that its aim is neither reactionary nor conservative, and therefore it is quite possible to achieve harmony and coordination with French democracy. Fascism is a pure product and cannot be transported to France or other countries, nor can it be applied to France or other countries. When asked about the different views between France and Italy, Mussolini replied that he believes understanding is possible, but also admitted that the current Franco-(Yugoslav) alliance is an obstacle to agreement between the two countries. Continuing the discussion on the disarmament conference, Mussolini said that the French government and public largely hold the opinion that Germany's demand for equality in armaments can never be recognized, which is a major cause of turmoil in European political and diplomatic circles today. If a nation like Germany is treated unfairly, the world will never have a peaceful day. If the policies of the former Allied Powers are not changed in the short term, the same disputes that previously led to war will become increasingly acute, and the final outcome is too terrible to contemplate. Finally, he said that at present, not only Europe, but the whole world is facing the prospect of disarmament, and that fair disarmament and the restoration of international trust are the only foundations for building a prosperous and secure edifice.</p>

<p>Discussing Methods for Invading Jehol and Overthrowing Zhang</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Permanently Station Troops in Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>Using Traitorous Troops to Incite Mutual Slaughter</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th Dispatch from the China United News Agency: General Mutō, Commander of the Kwantung Army, has scheduled a conference of chiefs of staff from various armies in the Eastern Provinces to be held in Shenyang for four days starting on the 27th. The main issues are: (1) the number of Japanese troops needed in the Three Eastern Provinces and their garrison locations; (2) military deployment matters required for Russia and China; (3) Japan has obtained the right to station troops under the new treaty, so ways to eliminate the Volunteer Army need to be devised; (4) strategies to be adopted regarding the Jehol issue; (5) discussing how to eliminate Zhang Xueliang's military strength in order to achieve the goal of completely overthrowing Zhang Xueliang. It is reported that the Japanese military will only be able to decide on a final attitude toward the Jehol issue after the conference.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th Dispatch from the China United News Agency: As a result of the consultations between Major General Okamura, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and the military authorities after his return to Japan, the Japanese army plans to permanently station troops in various parts of the Three Eastern Provinces. The details are highly confidential, but the main points obtained from the investigation are as follows: (1) All defenses in the Three Eastern Provinces will be jointly the responsibility of the Japanese army and the puppet regime, with traitorous troops specially assigned to deal with the Volunteer Army, implementing a policy of inciting mutual slaughter among the Chinese people. Key positions will be filled by Japanese personnel, who will also direct operations. (2) The main task of the Japanese army in Manchuria is to prepare for war against Russia and for military aggression in North China. In peacetime, they will avoid conflict with the Volunteer Army as much as possible, actively preserving their strength. However, along the South Manchuria Railway, where the lives and property of Japanese residents are involved, the Japanese army will be used as the main force. (3) In order to achieve the aforementioned goals, the Japanese army is gradually building fortresses and barracks needed for permanent troop deployments in key locations. The first step will be to establish bases in Manzhouli, Qiqihar, Harbin, Sanxing, Taonan, Changchun, Yanji, Jinzhou, and Chaoyang. (4) In addition to the troops stationed before September 18th, it is planned to increase the force by four to six divisions and distribute them to various locations. (5) The military expenses will initially be borne by the Japanese army itself, but in the future, the entire amount will be added to the puppet regime's burden, intensifying the exploitation of the people in Northeast China. (6) All Chinese public buildings, ancestral halls, and even former barracks should be unconditionally available for the Japanese army to use freely.</p>

<p>Fasting for Four Days, Now Dizzy and Speaking Weakly</p>
<p>Pune, 24th Dispatch from Reuters: Negotiations on the electoral system for the lower castes reached a compromise this morning. The announcement of this news comes at just the right time, as Gandhi's doctors claim that Gandhi's condition is gradually weakening due to a lack of nourishment, and is worsening with each passing hour. If the fast is not ended as soon as possible, there will be no hope of recovery. Now that the dispute has been resolved, Gandhi's life can be saved.</p>
<p>Pune, 24th Dispatch from Reuters: The formal agreement on the lower castes is currently being typed up and will be signed in prison by representatives of both the caste Hindus and the lower castes in front of Gandhi. At the same time, the leaders of both sides are drafting a telegram to British Prime Minister MacDonald, reporting the content of the agreement and asking the Prime Minister to cancel the part of his decision regarding the electoral system for the lower castes, so that Gandhi can immediately end his fast. Gandhi is lying quietly in bed, and when friends told him the content of the agreement, he propped himself up and smiled to show his agreement.</p>
<p>Pune, 23rd Dispatch from Reuters: Today's news is that Gandhi's condition is gradually deteriorating, his voice is weak, and he is suffering from nausea and dizziness, and it is difficult for him to open his eyes. He has not touched anything but water for the past eighty-two hours.</p>
<p>Pune, 24th Dispatch from the National News Agency: According to news this afternoon, the issue of the electoral system for the lower castes has been compromised. Half an hour before the compromise, at 2:20 p.m., Dr. Khilde, a famous mental health expert and personal physician, examined Gandhi's condition in front of the jail doctor of Yilaftada twice and expressed alarm each time. Khilde told reporters gathered in the prison that if he did not immediately stop receiving guests and stop negotiating, his life would be in danger, and even if he started eating again, it would be ineffective. He also said that although he had slept peacefully last night and his heartbeat was still good, his condition deteriorated this morning. It is not yet known whether Gandhi will stop fasting immediately. He had previously said that he would not eat until British Prime Minister MacDonald agreed to a negotiated solution.</p>

At present, the most attention is paid to the new cabinet's economic plan, especially its foreign trade policy, because Hansson declared a few days ago that he advocated creating a system for managing foreign trade in imitation of the Soviet Russian method, because only the state can manage foreign trade to balance imports and exports.</p>

<p>London, 23rd Dispatch from Reuters: The Lancashire cotton industry dispute, which lasted for about four weeks, has now been resolved. After eight days of negotiations, the representatives of both sides have agreed on a method of reducing wages by one shilling and eight and a quarter pence per pound. However, one more important point remains to be resolved, which is the issue of the reinstatement of all workers who had left the factory before the formal strike. Representatives of both sides are currently discussing this issue, and if necessary, they will meet overnight in order to find an agreement and resolve all disputes. It is expected that full resumption of work will not be possible on September 26th. This cotton industry strike began on August 27th and involved 200,000 workers. As a result, Britain lost business worth £1 million per week, and the workers lost £500,000 in wages per week. The employers originally planned to reduce wages by two shillings and nine pence per pound, but due to the mediation of the Ministry of Labor, both sides have agreed to reduce wages by one shilling and eight and a quarter pence per pound.</p>

<p>To Meet with Han in Weixian to Mediate the War</p>
<p>The Two Armies in Yexian Are at a Standstill</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the war in eastern Shandong, people across the country have paid great attention to it during this time of national crisis. Zhang Huacun, of the Shandong Provincial Reorganization Committee, telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou on the 20th, requesting that a senior official familiar with Shandong affairs be sent to the east to make effective mediation to avoid the suffering of the people. Chiang Kai-shek believed that Chief Counselor Jiang Bocheng had a close relationship with Han for three years, and also served as a member of the Provincial Party Department last year. He was quite familiar with the situation in Shandong, so he telegraphed Jiang, ordering him to go to Shandong to mediate as circumstances dictated. Jiang boarded a train from Ping for the south yesterday. We only received a telegram last night, and this morning (22nd) at 9 o'clock, people from all sectors of the military, government, and party went to the station to welcome him. At 9:30, Train 201 from Pingpu arrived in Jinan. Jiang got off the train and greeted the welcoming people one by one. He then went to the Jinan Central Bank to rest. I made a special trip to visit him. According to Jiang, this trip was due to an order from the Commander-in-Chief to come to Jinan to meet Chairman Han to mediate the Jiaodong Incident, hoping that both sides would first stop military action, and then deliberate on a settlement plan. Chairman Han has always been upright and has always obeyed the Commander-in-Chief, which I have always known. This action was taken as a last resort, and in the future, he will be able to obey the Commander-in-Chief's opinion to resolve the matter. Director Zhang (Xueliang) of Beiping also advocates resolving this matter as soon as possible, and also takes the Commander-in-Chief's opinion as his own. As for how to resolve it in the future, the method will be entirely decided by the central government. As for Liu Zhennian's side, I have not been in contact with him for a long time. I heard that he has reported the incident to the Commander-in-Chief. Chairman Han is currently at the front. I will accompany Committee Member Zhang Bingqian (Yue) east tonight to meet with Han to discuss everything. We plan to go to Weixian first and call Han on the phone, and then agree on a meeting place. At 5 p.m., Wang Fangting hosted a banquet for Jiang at his private residence in Zhijin City, and invited various important people to accompany him. At 12 o'clock that night, Jiang and Zhang Yue took a special train to Weixian. It is expected that they will be able to meet with Han tomorrow.</p>
<p>As for the situation at the front, it is reported that there is still fighting near Yexian. On the 20th, Zhang Luanji, commander of the Independent Brigade of Liu's army, led two regiments of infantry to attack Han's army from the southeast of the city. They were counterattacked head-on by Li Hanzhang's unit of the 85th Brigade of the 29th Division of Han's army. After several hours of fighting, Liu's army could not resist and retreated. At the same time, a unit of Liu's army at the Huoshen Temple in the South Gate of Yexian also bombarded Han's army with mortars. Han's army did not return fire. That afternoon, Han Fuju went to the front to inspect the front line in Shahe, arriving one mile outside the West Gate. Liu's army relied on trenches along the moat to resist the attack. There was a small conflict between the two sides, and Han immediately returned to Shahe. It is reported that three representatives of the people in Yexian City went to Han's camp in Shahe on the 21st to ask him to consider the lives of the people in the city and not to bombard the city. It is said that Liu's army in the city has begun to plunder, dismantling the doors and windows of civilian houses to repair the city moat. Civilian food has been sealed and marked, and civilians are running out of food. The morale of the army is panic-stricken. A company of garrison troops suddenly mutinied last night. Yexian has had a good autumn harvest this year, but most of the harvested crops are outside the city and have not been transported into the city. Therefore, the city is short of food and it is difficult to hold out for a long time. Han expressed that he would never use artillery bombardment unless absolutely necessary to avoid harming the people. The representatives thanked him and left. Now heavy troops and militiamen are stationed about four or five miles outside the city, like a gathering of clouds and mist, with a very strong attacking momentum, but they have not yet begun to attack. It is rumored that Liu Zhennian is also in Yexian City, but it is not known for sure. Weixian is currently rushing to build an airport for planes to take off and land. It will be completed soon (22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e83">Many Bandit Leaders in Honghu Captured <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the bandits He and Duan fled north to Nanzhang, and the remnants of the pseudo-7th Division also fled east led by the pseudo-Division Commander Wang Yiming, there are no large gangs of red bandits in Honghu. The suppression troops there have two divisions and one independent brigade. All the important passes have been recovered one after another, and they are now searching the center of the lake. Xu Yuanquan moved from Yuekou to Xindi on the 19th to command the various units. On the 20th, he inspected the area of Xiaogangwen, Huangpeng Mountain, and Koukou, and met with Zhu Huaibing, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs that evening. They returned to Xindi together on the 21st, and went to the front line of Zhuhe again on the 22nd to supervise the army. It is reported that it has been scheduled to clear all the remaining bandits in the lake before the 25th. The war situation there has been very smooth in recent days. Xu Jiwu, the brigade commander, personally led the Niu and Ren regiments on boats into Honghu on the morning of the 18th to search for bandits. They discovered dozens of large bandit ships at Yaokou River and immediately pursued them, seizing 40 guns and capturing 16 bandits, many of whom were important bandit criminals, including Xu Caiguang, the Minister of Reorganization of the Pseudo-Xiangxiyu Military Committee, Wu Chunfang, the Minister of Organization of the Pseudo-Xiang'exi-Hubei-Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Sun Huatang, the Chief of Staff of the Pseudo-Education Army and the current Chief of the Intelligence Section of the Pseudo-Xiang'exi Provincial Military Committee, Zhou Shaolou, the manager of the Pseudo-3rd Army, and Chen Wenjin, the director of the Financial Department of the Pseudo-7th Division. They have all been sent to Xindi to await interrogation. In Shijagou, Xiaotasi, and other places, more than 300 bandit soldiers were found, but they were all scarred and starving to death. They were also escorted to Xindi by the brigade to await orders. It is particularly noteworthy that the bandits value guns and ammunition very much. They do not fire a single bullet during the exchange of fire, and even if they are defeated, they would rather sacrifice more people than abandon a gun, because all sides are blocked and there is no way to get supplies. Since the 10th Army entered the lake, they have seized a large number of bandit guns, and they are still engaged in searching for guns. The 41st Division seized 66 rifles in Tongzi Lake on the 17th, 139 rifles on the 18th, and 8 mortars and 46 rifles south of Tongzi Lake on the 19th. A large number of weapons were also seized in Xihugang, Taxiehe, Chenjiadun, Datokou, Jiangsikou, Zhengdaohu, and Sunjiatai. On the 20th, the division continued to seize 26 rifles and carbines, 1 submachine gun and 1 pistol, 5 or 6 major pieces of machinery from the arsenal, 17 small pieces of machinery, and more than 120 parts. On the 21st, 81 rifles and carbines were seized in Potian Goufangjiawan, Li Haichun, a pseudo-battalion commander, was captured, and a large part of the arsenal's machinery and a radio were salvaged. Xu Jiwu Brigade of the 48th Division seized 11 mortars, 21 gun carriages, and 77 rifles. Xue's Regiment of the New 3rd Brigade also found more than 300 rifles stored by the bandits south of Dukou Dakou. It can be seen that the red bandits there are now only concerned with escaping, and they do not care about the guns. Commander Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Xu Yuanquan to convey his praise for the loyalty and courage of Zhang and Liu's units in striking at the bandit dens. He also telegraphed Zeng Yiding, the commander of the Second Fleet of the Navy, to convey his praise for the meritorious service of the Yong Sui, Min Sheng, Min Quan, Xian Ning, De Sheng, Wei Sheng, Shun Sheng, Gong Sheng, Yi Sheng, and Ren Sheng warships in patrolling the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and assisting in the suppression, in order to encourage them (September 23rd).</p>

<p>Jiang and Cai Go to Zhangzhou Upon Arrival in Xiamen</p>
<p>Jiang Then Goes to the Provincial Capital from Zhangzhou</p>
<p>Situation in Xiamen: Xiamen Correspondence: Jiang Guangding, Director of the Fujian Pacification Office, and Cai Tingkai, Commander of the 19th Route Army, arrived in Xiamen on the Java Company's Zhi Ni Jianana輪 on the afternoon of the 16th. After lunch, they went to Songyu by electric boat with Jiang Yanfu, Lin Yuheng, Xu Minghong, Tang Dehuang, and others who came with them.

Jiang gave a speech to the press on the ship. (Reporter asked) The Fujian Provincial Defense Army has always been criticized by the public, and has recently had conflicts with the people from time to time. I don’t know if it will still be under the command of the provincial government in the future. Director Jiang must have a plan in mind. Can you tell us about it? (Jiang replied) This matter has not been discussed yet, and I cannot express it at this time. (Asked) He Xianzhu, the deputy commander of the 3rd Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, recently extorted tobacco seedling donations and sent troops to massacre Dongsha Village. It is said that the clan chief of the village and people from Putian and Xianyou have sent telegrams to the Pacification Office to accuse He. How will Director Jiang deal with this matter? (Answered) I don’t know the situation of this matter, and I haven’t received a report. (Asked) Regarding the military affairs of suppressing the Communists in western Fujian, will Commander Cai still be in charge in the future? (Answered) Commander Cai will still be in charge. (Asked) When will Director Jiang go to the province? (Answered) In a day or two. (Asked) Will the Director go ashore today or go directly to Zhangzhou? (Answered) Go ashore first, and then go to Zhangzhou after resting. Lin Guogeng and Cai Tingkai had already approached at this point, and Jiang and Lin and others went to the Ping Dian Lun of the Bank of China and landed at the Zhangfu Wharf. It was exactly 12:40 p.m. The Maritime Public Security Bureau sent Inspector Liao Weijin to lead more than a dozen water police officers to take the electric boat to protect them. The Marine Corps Company of the 19th Route Army was dispatched on shore to post sentries, and the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau also arrived. After Jiang, Cai, Lin, and others landed, they went to the fourth floor of the 19th Route Army Office to rest, talked for about 20 minutes, and Lin Guogeng resigned and returned to the headquarters. Jiang and others had lunch at the office. At 2:30 p.m., Jiang, Cai, Huang Qiang, Tang Dehuang, Jiang Yanfu, and others took the electric boat of the Road Administration Office to Songyu and entered Zhangzhou. At the same time, the Maritime Public Security Bureau also sent 12 armed water police officers to take the Zhonghe electric boat to escort them to Song. The 19th Route Army Headquarters in Zhangzhou sent a squad of guards to escort them on the Daban Sheng electric boat.</p>
<p>Situation in the Province: Fuzhou Correspondence: After Jiang Guangding and Cai Tingkai entered Zhangzhou from Xiamen, Jiang returned to Xiamen from Zhangzhou.

He rested briefly at the Naval Entertainment Club. Those who came to Majiang to welcome them that day included Xing Dian, Director of the Adjutant's Office, Fan Zongchi, Director of the General Staff Office, Tan Qixiu, Brigade Commander, members of the provincial government, the deputy commander of the martial law, and the brigade commander of the 1st Brigade of the Army. Before long, Jiang and others left the Lianhuan Club and took a fast boat to the province. Fang, the acting chairman of the Taijiang Naval Public Office, and the heads of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Finance and Education, as well as all the commissioners of the Provincial Party Department, were waiting there. Representatives of various social organizations also went to the new Taijiang Wharf or Wanshou Bridge to express their welcome. After Jiang shook hands with Fang as a courtesy, Fang invited him to board a car and go to the city to go directly to the Pacification Office. The sound of firecrackers was loud along the way. After Jiang arrived at the Pacification Office, he personally came out to meet the representatives of various social organizations and thanked them for their welcome. The representatives of the social organizations also gave welcome speeches and expressed their expectations for the two matters of suppressing the Communists and resisting Japan.

<h3 id="e86">After the Recovery of Jinjiazhai in Xinji, It is Decided to Establish Jingfu and Lihuang Counties <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>A New Military Agricultural System Will Be Piloted</p>
<p>Uncultivated Land Will Be Given to Soldiers to Cultivate</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that Xinji, belonging to Guangshan County in Henan Province, and Jinjiazhai, belonging to Lu'an County in Anhui Province, have been bandit dens for several years. Xinji was the location of the puppet "Henan-Hubei-Anhui Three-Province Soviet," gathering a large number of bandits. Jinjiazhai was particularly famous for its rugged mountain roads and precipitous terrain. For nearly a hundred years since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, it has long been a haven for bandits, even called "the modern Liangshan Marsh." The Red bandits have occupied this place for six years. Their leaders are Kuang Jixun, Xu Xiangqian, Liao Chakun, Zhang Guotao, Chen Changhao, Xu Bingzhong, Deng Zhigao, etc., possessing tens of thousands of troops. They take Xinji, Jinjiazhai, Qiliping, Xuanhuadian, Shangcheng, Yingshan, Huang'an, and Zhufo'an as their military and political center, making every effort to operate. In Xinji and Jinjiazhai, they have built extremely solid fortifications, stockpiling grain and ammunition, believing that they can take the three provinces if they advance, and defend themselves if they retreat. Recently, the government army advanced in multiple routes, winning victories one after another. All important towns have been recovered in order. Jinjiazhai was the last to fall, and the remnant bandits fled in disorder. Although they have not been completely wiped out, their base area is completely lost. The time for complete suppression should not be far off. Commander-in-chief Chiang Kai-shek believes that Xinji is located between Bopi River in Guangshan County, Henan Province, and Qiliping in Huang'an County, Hubei Province, and has been deeply influenced by bandits. Jinjiazhai is more than 200 li away from Lu'an County, more than 200 li away from Huoqiu County, and more than 100 li away from Shangcheng County in Henan Province. For the sake of permanent peace and convenience of control, it is necessary to change the county governance. It was originally planned to rename Xinji as Yongjing County and Jinjiazhai as Yongning County. Later, because Liu Zhi and Wei Lihuang made great contributions to suppressing bandits, it was decided to rename Xinji as Jingfu County and Jinjiazhai as Lihuang County to commemorate their achievements. Both are under the jurisdiction of Henan Province. The county magistrate is also recommended by Liu Zhi. Although his duty is that of a county magistrate, he is actually treated as an administrative inspector commissioner, increasing his status and giving him power, so that he can be responsible for handling local affairs. It is heard that Liu has selected two capable officers and recommended them to Chiang, and detailed the local disaster situation, requesting emergency relief. Chiang has replied by telegram asking Liu to plan and decide to do his best to remedy the situation. The land problem in the bandit area should also be solved. According to a staff member of the headquarters, wherever the Red bandits have occupied for a long time, they have implemented the slogan of "overthrowing local tyrants and distributing land." In reality, only the real Red Army enjoyed the distribution of land. Also, because they were plundering everywhere, they could not cultivate and harvest. The real farmers were driven to become "substitute cultivation teams." As a result, "substitute cultivation" became "lazy cultivation." Therefore, the so-called Red areas were nothing but barren and desolate land. Now, the headquarters has invited experts to discuss and has drafted regulations on military agricultural settlements in the bandit areas, stipulating that if the area of abandoned land in each county in the bandit areas exceeds six-tenths of the total cultivated land in the county, it will be designated as a military agricultural settlement county. All abandoned land in the military agricultural settlement county will be confiscated and owned by the public, and land will be distributed to the active soldiers for cultivation according to the number of people. Approximately three to seven mu of land will be allocated to each soldier. All detailed regulations will be announced soon. This military agricultural settlement method will be first piloted in Jingfu and Lihuang counties. (September 23)</p>

<p>Although the oil of Yanchang is the only product that makes Yanchang increase its status, after three days, we were already satiated with the smell of oil, and finally had to leave reluctantly. I remember that day was September 3rd. Because of the lack of a good horse, I had to change to a small donkey. It didn't walk very fast. I sat on its back and had plenty of time to browse all the natural beauty. The clear spring in the stream seemed to be playing a constant rhythm. The pearl dew on the green grass was inadvertently destroyed by the trampling of the donkey's hooves. If the dew knew, it would definitely scold the imperialist behavior of mankind. After an hour or two, we parted with the stream and walked into the mountains. At first, the weak donkey seemed to be able to勉强 follow the horses. However, the mountain became steep, and it was too weak to climb the mountain, so I had to come down and lead it straight up the green mountain path. After a few minutes, the horse tracks in front of me became blurred and even disappeared. Alas, I had fallen behind. When I reached the high mountain plain, although I鞭驴疾走, I could not see the riders in front, nor the people sitting on the luggage mules behind. I was like Zhang Guolao riding a donkey alone, in the vast mountains, there was a possibility of getting lost everywhere. My heart was very full. For a moment, I felt that the beautiful little flowers on the side of the road seemed to be義誚ing the uneducated traveler. The wheat ears in the field, which were raised and had not yet垂垂, laughed very傲慢ly at the monotonous行人. The clouds passed slowly, and the wind came萧萧. It did not give any guidance to my future. In the crossroads where people徘徊摸索, the wind and clouds, which are the most out of all material things, seemed to be pulling their faces and becoming snobbish. I finally arrived at Aqingzhai, the place where all the 打煎 was located, at one o'clock in the afternoon, and met with the riders. We sat on the stones in twos and threes to rest. After half an hour, we saw the luggage mule team coming湾湾曲曲游蜓 like a long snake. At that time, our only lunch, noodles and 玉蜀黍, had already been cooked in the home of an old 百姓, waiting for the cook to bring them out. The pressure on our stomachs was too利害, so we devoured them like狼吞虎嚥. We had all given up all unnatural虚伪, and unintentionally暴露着 mankind's固有的天真 in Shaanxi from time to time, just like the巍大的山脉 exposed the coal oil or other treasures that he had蕴积 for thousands of years.

<p>Minutes of the Red Branch Meeting: The Songjiang Red Branch held its sixth meeting at the meeting hall on Malu Bridge on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month. Chairman Sheng Yuanyin's agenda included: (1) Whether the epidemic hospital should be closed early. Resolved: Because the weather is getting colder and the epidemic atmosphere has been killed, and all the inpatients have been cured and discharged, and because the funds of this branch are extremely short due to not issuing donation booklets, it is decided to close it early at the end of this month to save expenses. (2) Reassignment of the staff of the office of this branch. Resolved: Wu Chengfu is promoted to executive director and Zhu Zishou is promoted to secretary and designer. In addition to sending letters urging them to take office on a specific date, Huang Xiaohe is also promoted to assist in the work to facilitate the progress. (3) The case of purchasing a base for the construction of the meeting hall of this branch.

<p>Merchants Request Postponement of Implementation of Weights and Measures: The county government was ordered to promote weights and measures, and first sent personnel to inspect the scales and rulers of various industries on a daily basis. Now, various trade associations feel that it is inconvenient to gather and change to the new system. Yesterday, a joint meeting was convened at the county chamber of commerce to report that the old scales of the copper, tin, iron, lacquer, candle, and flour industries that have been investigated have been sealed and canceled. It is ordered to change to the new system of weights and measures within one week. If the old instruments are still used during the second phase of the investigation, they will be detained and punished. However, Suzhou, which was the old provincial capital and a place with flourishing commerce, has not yet heard of the implementation of the new system of weights and measures. Shanghai, which is the gathering place of national commerce, has once investigated weights and measures, but it has been several months and there is no news of changing to the new system. The source of commercial goods in Song City mostly comes from Suzhou and Shanghai. If Songyi changes to the new system before Suzhou and Shanghai, Song merchants will suffer losses and it is unbearable. After discussion by the crowd, it was generally agreed that it would be appropriate to wait until Suzhou and Shanghai implement the new system before Songyi follows suit. The decision was telegraphed to the provincial government, requesting that the county be ordered to postpone the implementation temporarily to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.</p>

After Wang went out of the city to Aozi Street, the civilians, who had not stated the reasons for their anger, dispersed. A dispute thus came to an end.</p>

<p>Preventing Immense Calamities Caused by Welcoming Gods and Holding Temple Fairs On the 18th of this month in the morning, the local populace suddenly spread the word that the Wu Xiang Temple was about to welcome gods and hold temple fairs. Upon hearing the news, various organizations immediately convened a meeting to discuss methods of prevention. It was agreed that a letter would be sent to the Third Company of the Provincial Security Force stationed in Pu Province, requesting them to dispatch 40 men. The Protection Corps would dispatch 7 men, and the Public Security Bureau would dispatch 10 men to go and peacefully persuade them to desist. At 5:00 AM on the 19th, various organizations arrived at the temple and saw over two hundred men and women burning incense, gathered in front of the temple gate, showing no signs of disturbance. Unexpectedly, in less than an hour, the sound of gongs arose from all directions, and in an instant, a crowd of one or two thousand people gathered, surrounding the Wu Xiang Temple, throwing incense fiercely into the temple. The crowd grew larger and larger. The Provincial Security Force and others inside tried to persuade them with great effort but to no avail. It was said that gunshots were heard in the midst of the crowd. Seeing this situation, the police and security forces were deeply concerned that bandits might be hiding among them, taking the opportunity to riot, so they fired shots into the sky as a warning and retreated from the temple gate. The Director and Company Commander were both beaten and injured. Police officers from the Provincial Security Force, the Protection Corps, and the Public Security Bureau were tied up with cloth by the rioters and placed behind the temple, where they were burned. They were later sent to the hospital for treatment. The police and security forces lost five rifles. Among the populace, three male and one female villager were found dead from gunshot wounds. Upon receiving the news, the county government immediately dispatched the third squad leader of the county police to suppress the situation. The county government also ordered the arrest of Wu Chen and Long Hua, the monks of the Wu Xiang Temple, as well as the village head and the police officer involved in the incident, and brought them to the government office for interrogation.</p>

<p>Win the Senior Singles Final</p>
<p>The Shanghai Senior Tennis Singles semi-final, which has attracted national attention, Lin Baohua vs. Qiu Feihai, Zheng Zhaojia vs. De Fufu, which was postponed from last Sunday, will be held today. These four are the four gold medalists in the Shanghai tennis world. Once they compete, it will naturally cause a sensation. The order of play is as follows: Zheng Zhaojia vs. De Fufu starting at 2:15 PM, followed by Lin Baohua vs. Qiu Feihai. The venue is the French Chamber of Commerce. Tickets are one yuan per person.</p>
<p>Today's battle is of such great importance that it needs no further description. However, there is one thing that must be told to the audience: Lin and Qiu have competed twice before, each winning once with a score of 3-1. Today is essentially the final between the two. Therefore, it attracts even more attention from the audience. However, both Lin and Qiu are heroes of the Chinese tennis world. Who wins and who loses is not important. It is best to put victory and defeat aside and appreciate this great match with a proper and broad vision. It is hoped that proper consolation and encouragement will be given to both the winner and the loser. As for Zheng Zhaojia vs. De Fufu, Zheng may not be able to win. Some say that De Fufu's technique has become even more refined this year than last year. If so, then it is even more difficult for Zheng to be optimistic. But no matter what, Zheng is a rising young player whose skills have not yet reached their peak. Even if Zheng fails in this battle, we must not lose hope. We should comfort and encourage him. It is hoped that the audience will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Lin and Qiu Defeated British De Fufu and White 3-1</p>
<p>Sun Linfang Defeated Sun Na to Win the Shanghai Junior Singles Championship</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai defeated British De Fufu and White with full spirit and after four sets of fierce battle, winning the Robert Cup for the third consecutive year. More than a thousand spectators rejoiced in the success of Lin and Qiu in winning glory for the Chinese tennis world, in addition to enjoying the feast for the eyes. In the Junior Singles Final, Sun Linfang also defeated Sun Na 3-1 to win the championship. The Junior Singles competition has been won by China every year since 1930, for three years now. The first time was Yu Tianguang, the second time was Qian Wenbao, and this year, yesterday, was the third time for Sun Linfang. It cannot be said that the progress of the Chinese tennis world in recent years is not significant. Yesterday's matches were held at the French Chamber of Commerce. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e116">Junior Singles <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>|Sun Linfang Wins the Championship|</p>
<p>Starting at 2:15 PM, Sun Linfang and Sun Na began competing for the Junior Singles Championship. The performance of the two was mediocre and lacked excitement. Because their techniques lacked both variety and skill, it was boring. In the first set, Sun Linfang showed timidity everywhere. He was unable to calmly deal with the opponent's mediocre shots and often made unforced errors. As a result, Sun lost the first set 2-6. Sun showed some improvement in the second set, and the opponent repeatedly lost points. Sun won 6-3. In the third set, Sun Na was at a loss, while Sun's spirit gradually recovered. The timidity was somewhat removed, and he won 6-1 without much effort. The competition in the fourth set was more intense, and the situation was quite tense. However, Sun could have won but was careless. In a mediocre situation, he caused the audience to worry about Sun's gains and losses. From 2-2, 3-3, all the way to 6-6, 7-7, Sun had the advantage at times, but unexpectedly, this situation developed. Fortunately, he added two more games at the end and won the final victory 9-7.</p>

<p>|China Wins the Championship|</p>
<p>Brief Description of Skills Yesterday, the cooperation between Lin and Qiu was flawless. There was no significant difference in the individual skills of the two. They both performed well. Qiu Feihai maintained a calm attitude throughout. Lin Shihua still inevitably made one or two mistakes in his high-pressure shots, which he has always regarded as difficult, but his successful</p>
<h3 id="e118">Robert Cup China-England Final (Yongfang Photography) <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>works cannot be said to be few. His forehand strokes also had few mistakes. His serve was his specialty, and he used it to score points. In short, the two were in high spirits and worked hard, causing the famous generals De Fufu and White to admit defeat. As for England's defeat, it was due to White's inability to replicate his usual performance. He often disappointed. De Fufu was as strong as ever and had brilliant moments. His performance was no less than Lin and Qiu's.</p>
<p>Winning Two Sets in a Row The match followed the conclusion of the Junior Singles Final. De Fufu failed to serve, and Lin Baohua won the serve. China then won two games. Later, White and Qiu took turns serving, each winning one game. England's momentum suddenly became strong. Lin and Qiu's high balls were improperly returned, giving the opponent a chance to intercept. England took a 5-3 lead. China was in immediate danger. Fortunately, De Fufu's serve failed, and Lin Baohua's serve won, turning the tide and making it 5-5. After that, England took the lead at times, and Lin and Qiu equalized. After 7-7, China added two more games in a row and reversed the defeat with a score of 9-7. From the second set onwards, China progressed smoothly. The ball was often aimed at both sides, making it difficult for the enemy to parry. Lin Baohua's serve often won. As a result, they won 6-3. The competition in the last game was particularly fierce, with five ties. Whether it was a volley, a high ball, or a high-pressure shot, each side displayed their strengths in a variety of ways. However, De Fufu's serve had three double faults, which led to Lin and Qiu's victory.</p>
<p>One Gain and One Loss In the first two sets, Lin and Qiu were in high spirits, doing whatever they wanted and succeeding easily. They thought it would be easy to win three straight sets, but unexpectedly, Lin and Qiu changed their previous state in the third set, feeling dull and getting worse and worse. They lost 1-6, so they continued to work hard in the competition in the fourth set, making four games in one go. However, Lin Baohua's serve in the following game ended in a disastrous defeat. In De Fufu's serve, Lin and Qiu often sent high balls, but they were too close to the net, giving the opponent a chance to attack, resulting in a 4-3 score, and then 4-4. The situation suddenly became equal again. Lin and Qiu won back one game of White's serve and regained priority. The next game was Lin's serve. The audience clapped their hands to welcome it, wishing him success. Sure enough, he lived up to expectations and won the championship with a score of 6-4.</p>

<p>Our Country Presents Silver Tripod</p>
<p>Carries Voluntary Mail</p>
<p>Captain Wolfgang von Gronau, the German aviator circumnavigating the globe, along with his assistant Captain Ziemer, pilot Heck, and wireless operator Alberley, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday on a Dornier Wal flying boat and was warmly welcomed. The China Aviation Construction Association originally planned a banquet last night, but Captain von Gronau declined politely due to the urgency of time. Instead, a silver tripod was presented, inscribed with the four characters "Peng Cheng Wan Li" (A bright future) to commemorate the occasion. Captain von Gronau is scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Hong Kong this morning at 7:00 am, then to Manila, carrying approximately 10 kilograms of voluntary mail. The China Aviation Construction Association also sent a welcome letter to Captain von Gronau yesterday, stating: The China Aviation Construction Association extends its sincerest and warmest welcome and wishes him great success in the entire journey. Captain von Gronau departed from his motherland, passed through dozens of countries, crossed several oceans, and experienced countless hardships. This astonishing flight, which has shocked the whole world, is indeed an extremely glorious feat and is admirable. Captain's this trip is not only a success for his individual, but also enough to enhance the friendly relations between the people of China and Germany. China and Germany have always had good relations, especially in aviation, which started the earliest and has achieved remarkable results. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation is the best example of aviation cooperation between China and Germany. Aviation relations between China and Germany not only benefit the two countries, but also benefit the world's transportation and culture. The Captain's aircraft not only carries the friendly relations between China and Germany, but also carries the seeds of world culture. China's aviation industry is still in its infancy. Its development depends on the thorough awareness and efforts of the Chinese government and the people, and also hopes for the help of friendly people from abroad. The Captain's arrival gives us great encouragement and excitement. This Association represents all members to wish the people of the two countries closer and closer, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries closer and closer, like the two wings of an aircraft that cannot be separated. There is also an attached statement: This Association, together with China and Eurasia Aviation Corporations, originally planned to hold a grand meeting to welcome him sincerely. However, due to the Captain's eagerness to go to the south, now a silver tripod is respectfully presented to wish Captain von Gronau a bright future.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Shanghai United National Shipping Alliance <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Regulating Business</p>
<p>Maintaining Navigation Rights</p>
<p>Already in Preparation</p>
<p>Among the Chinese shipping companies, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanpei Steam Navigation Company, and Ning Shao Steam Navigation Company have been the largest in scale and business. In recent years, small-scale shipping companies have gradually increased in the Yangtze River and coastal routes, numbering about 40. They all have irregular routes and infrequent schedules, loading and transporting passengers and goods anytime and anywhere. The "January 28th Incident" occurred this year, and silver money companies have been cautious in lending money. Various trade guilds have reduced their purchases, and the shipping industry has been most affected. In addition, the Northeast was forcibly occupied by Japan, navigation rights were lost, national ships cannot travel smoothly, and the scope of shipping is further reduced. Chinese shipping is in danger of collapsing. Chen Bogang and Yu Qiaqing, chairmen of the Shanghai Shipping Association, in order to save national ships and maintain navigation rights, implemented a United National Shipping Alliance to resist the encroachment of foreign ships. The reporter heard the news and went to various parties for detailed investigations and reports the general situation as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Alliance: There are more than 40 Chinese shipping companies of all sizes in Shanghai. Except for a few with fixed routes and schedules, the rest are small in scale, with only one or two merchant ships and no fixed routes. Most of them dispatch ships temporarily to load and transport passengers and goods. There are often several ships competing to sail to one place, and they abuse fare reductions in order to compete for cargo, disrupting business and destroying freight rates. This year, there is a shortage of goods in various places, and shipping has plummeted. Among the dozens of national ships in Shanghai, only the China Wei and Da Tong companies have better business. Since the puppet state and Japan signed a treaty, the routes of national ships have become more restricted. Chen Bogang and Yu Qiaqing, chairmen of the Shanghai Shipping Association, agreed to save the sluggish Chinese shipping industry and decided to start with the alliance of the whole body of companies to cooperate.</p>
<p>Methods of Unity: Chen and Yu proposed the united national ships, advocating open business and avoiding fierce competition. Chen has presented this theme to all members, and all companies have expressed their sympathy. The general method of this unity is to unite all shipping companies and allocate all merchant ships according to the original routes of each ship, then jointly controlled by the joint office, so as to ensure an average, to adjust excesses and deficiencies, so that freight rates are uniform, and no unauthorized increases or decreases are allowed. Its business is handled in accordance with the Lian'an Shipping Bureau method of the six companies on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, so as to maintain long-term operations.</p>
<p>Maintaining Navigation Rights: After the establishment of the United National Shipping Alliance, it can eliminate internal competition among the same industry, freight and passenger fares will also be unified, schedules will be fixed, and there will be no worry about the lack of ships or goods. It is also more convenient for passengers, and the ships can be used to control the traffic on the Yangtze River and coastal routes to prevent foreign merchants' ships from coveting and encroaching. National goods in various ports that resist enemy ships can be transported by national ships. This move is also of great significance for maintaining navigation rights. This matter is currently being planned and managed by Mr. Chen and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Freight Rate Issue: Regarding the issue of freight rates and cash payments, the shipping companies in Shanghai have agreed that starting from September 16, passenger and freight fares will be paid in cash, and at most 10-day promissory notes will no longer be recorded. This newspaper once recorded this matter. However, after this announcement, all customs brokers unanimously opposed it and refused to pay in cash. In the past few days, the shipping companies and customs brokers have been negotiating on this matter. According to the customs brokers' requirement for 45-day payment period, the shipping companies have agreed to make concessions after public discussions and changed it to 25-day payment period. It is still under discussion and will probably be decided in a month.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Chu Minyi Says Wang's Illness is Still Serious <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Noel Went to Hangzhou Yesterday</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, returned to Shanghai from Mogan Mountain the night before last. A reporter from the New Voice Press visited Mr. Chu at the Sino-French Industrial College and asked about the exact condition of Mr. Wang Jingwei. He was kindly informed that the level of sugar in Wang's urine was 1.97 per thousand the last time he was examined in Shanghai. This time, the result was 2.16 per thousand, so the increase in his condition can be known from the comparison. Furthermore, taking the sugar level of ordinary people as an example, it averages about 0.90 to 1.20 per thousand, so Mr. Wang's condition cannot be effective in a short time. Wang's disease not only contains a lot of sugar, but also contains acetone. At the same time, his mouth can smell an ether-like odor. This odor is enough to help aggravate diabetes, but fortunately it is still very slight and easy to remove, but it will not work without a considerable period of rest. When former Minister Gu Mengyu went to Hangzhou, he went to see him with a German doctor, who also said that his illness must be fundamentally resolved, otherwise it may worsen at any time. As for the results of recent recuperation, the fever has completely subsided. Now Dr. Noel has discovered new results after experimenting on Wang's disease and will go to Hangzhou (ie yesterday) and then to Mogan Mountain to diagnose Wang. Currently, Mr. Wang eats very little, and completely refuses to eat any starchy foods. However, it will take at least a few weeks of recuperation to make it absolutely not in contact with the outside world and not use brain power to be effective. I am also a doctor who does not hang up a pot in the mountains, so I am always there to assist, and there are no other tasks. It is also learned that Mr. Chu is scheduled to return to Nanjing tomorrow and will have to go to Hangzhou again within three days.</p>

Yesterday, the association received a telegram from Zhang saying that the incident would not expand. The Jinan Chamber of Commerce and others also telegraphed that peace was expected. In addition, Shen Honglie also had a telegram reporting the latest situation. The telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from Zhang Boling: I arrived in Jinan and had talks with all parties. I learned that the content of this incident is not complicated and is not as rumored outside and will not expand. Now Director Li is telegraphing the front to schedule a meeting with Zhang Boling. (Sent at 9:10 am on the 24th)</p>
<p>Reply Telegram from Han Fuju: Urgent, The General Assembly of the War Abolition Society, respectfully read the telegram. Mr. Zhang Boling is welcome to come to Shandong. I will return to Jinan in the near future and can talk about everything in detail. Han Fuju respectfully. Sent at 12:35 pm on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Reply Telegram to Zhang Boling: Urgent to Jinan Chamber of Commerce to forward to Mr. Zhang Boling. Respected telegram received. I have just received a telegram from Han saying, "Mr. is welcome to come to Shandong. I will return to Jinan in the near future and can talk about everything," etc. We believe that the situation is urgent, and we earnestly request you to go to the front to meet with Han to achieve a method of elimination as soon as possible. Please consider and telegraph a reply. War Abolition Society General Assembly respectfully. Reply Telegram from Jinan Groups: Respected telegrams received. Mr. Zhang Boling arrived in Jinan yesterday morning and is now waiting for a reply from Chairman Han, planning to go to the front for talks. After investigating the cause of this military, it is not complicated and there is hope for peace. Jinan Chamber of Commerce, Bank Association, Money Industry Association respectfully. (Sent at 10:10 am on the 24th)</p>
<p>Telegram from Shen Honglie: The General Assembly of the War Abolition Society, After receiving your telegram, I learned that your Association entrusted Standing Committee member Mr. Zhang Boling to represent you in Shandong to seek reconciliation. Your enthusiasm and determination are deeply admired. Mr. Boling's morality and achievements have always been admired by the people of the country. His words are invaluable and will surely be effective. I have known Mr. Zhang for a long time and will do my best to assist him and hope to meet your expectations. Please release the note. Furthermore, Yantai Longkou is a mixed place of Chinese and foreigners, and people's hearts are restless. If there is any untruth, it is inevitable to involve diplomacy. Yesterday, Liu's army in Longkou withdrew, and the chief of the public security bureau also left. All local authorities asked our army to protect them because no one was responsible. I have ordered the Yongxiang and Chuyu warships stationed there to temporarily send troops to land to maintain order and protect foreigners, and will not ask about politics or finance. Once someone takes over, they will withdraw their defenses and return to the ships. Now fortunately, the place is peaceful, and both Chinese and foreigners are harmonious. The Yantai Local Chamber of Commerce and the American Consul also asked our army's Zhaochun warship stationed in Yantai to send troops to assist in defense. Since Liu's army still has a small number of troops stationed in Yantai, although they agreed to do their best to protect them, they could not immediately land. The above two sections are the latest situation. In addition to informing the Han and Liu armies to avoid misunderstandings, I have informed you of the note and reported it. Shen Honglie.</p>
<p>Reply Telegram to Shen Honglie: Mayor Shen of Qingdao, I have received your telegram, and I admire your love of peace and maintaining order. If the current situation can avoid war, please telegraph as soon as possible. Mr. Boling has arrived in Jinan, and Han sent a welcome telegram. Also heard, War Abolition Society General Assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Completion of the Dongtang Project the Pond Works Association Entertained People from All Walks of Life Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Shen Yi, Mu Ouchu, and Others Gave Speeches in Succession</p>
<p>The Traffic at Gaogiao Breaks the Silence</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Seawall had been in disrepair for many years, and in last year's autumn flood season, it was almost in danger. Fortunately, it was rescued properly and nothing happened. Subsequently, under the supervision and assistance of the government and the people, the Jiangnan Pond Works Committee proceeded smoothly and has completed its work. The Association entertained people from all walks of life yesterday afternoon to visit the Gaogiao Pond Works in Pudong. At around 2:00 pm, they arrived at the seawall to inspect the various sections, accounting for seven or eight tenths of the entire Gaogiao project. Due to limited funds, it can only be safely maintained for a while and is not very solid. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Departing Personnel: Yesterday at 1:00 pm, the visitors from all walks of life gathered at the Bund Bronze Man Wharf and immediately boarded a ship to depart. The Jiangnan Pond Works Committee was led by Vice Chairman Mu Ouchu, Committee Members Jin Houcheng, Xu Guanzhi, Tang Chengzong, Zhong Renjie, Shi Wendan, and Director of the Municipal Government Works Bureau Shen Yi, etc. They arrived at Gaogiao around 2:00 pm and disembarked, then took a car to the car station, and then hired rickshaws to go to the Pond Works Office for inspection.</p>
<p>Overview of Dongtang: Dongtang is 16 kilometers long. The old seawall protection project was incomplete, which led to a sudden danger on August 24 last year when it encountered a hurricane. At that time, there were more than ten places that were urgently repaired. The construction of the current project is limited by funds and can only be built in the most important places, which is not even seven tenths of the dangerous places last year. A total of nine sections were built this year, including seven sections of stone work and two sections of cement work, with a total length of more than 2 kilometers and a total project cost of more than 284,000 yuan. Construction started successively on June 20, and it has been more than two months now. Except for the Yuanyi cement work section, which has not been completed due to changes in the plan, the remaining eight sections have all been completed. The old-style stone work is used, but the stone is replaced with 1-3-6 concrete cement glue. The wood is also slightly lengthened. Due to the different structures, there are three types: two stones, three stones, and three barrages. There are seven locations for this project. According to the terrain, tide, and wind and wave conditions, separate plans are made for the required work. Except for the large stones purchased by the Works Bureau itself, the rest are contracted by the Zhongnan Company. A total of more than 11,540 cubic meters of large stones are used, costing more than 45,830 yuan. The remaining labor and materials are contracted for more than 159,900 yuan, totaling 205,759 yuan and 61 cents. The cement work was built before the Works Bureau took over. After last year's unusual storm, a section of the Yuanyi section's wall collapsed, and the cement wall of the Rongzi section also tilted outward. This time, it is a repair work and an additional protection wall project. All the required labor and materials are contracted by the Zhongnan Company, costing 74,756 yuan. Because of the change in plan, the collapsed wall of the Yuanyi section has been purchased 997 cubic meters of large stones by the Works Bureau for a supply of 3,887 yuan, totaling 78,643 yuan.</p>
<p>Shen and Mu's Speeches: After inspecting the various places, there are the Shuizi section, Yizi section, Yuanzi section, Qiangzi section, Rongzi section, Juzi section, and Chenfu section. As for the Shouzi and Yuzi sections, they were not visited due to time constraints. After the visit, at 5:00 pm, Zhang Danru, director of the Pudong Pond Works Management Office, entertained people from all walks of life to rest at the Pond Works Office. Director Shen then reported that this pond work started on June 15 and was completed in mid-September, which took about three months. Thanks to the success of local people and the Pond Works Committee, Vice Chairman Mu, etc. Subsequently, Mr. Mu reported that the pond work repair funds were 150,000 from the municipal government, 400,000 from the provincial government, 250,000 from the Ministry of Railways, and 10,000 from the flood relief donation, totaling 810,000, which can only treat the symptoms. If it is to treat the root cause, it will cost millions, so the completion of this project can be said to be a very small part of treating the symptoms, and at most it can be safely maintained for half a year. The danger is still inevitable. I hope that the National Government can extract millions of yuan from the absence of a way to fundamentally repair it, so that it can be done once and for all. At around 6:00 pm, they boarded a ship and returned.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Murai Left Shanghai Yesterday to Return <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Murai Kuramatsu, the former Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, was transferred to Sydney, Australia as Consul-General by order of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He has been busy packing his luggage and rushing to complete the handover in recent days. Since the matter has been completed, he left Shanghai at 9:30 yesterday morning on the Nisshin Company's Shunyo Maru to return to Japan. After reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he will go to Sydney to take up his new post. Those who went to the wharf to see him off included Japanese Consul-General Ishisha Jutaro, Deputy Consul Shirai Yasu, American Consul-General Kreminhan, British Consul-General Bredemann, and dozens of representatives from Japanese groups in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Fushun and Jilin Have Been Recovered One After Another</p>
<p>The Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association office received a victory report yesterday saying that Wang Fengge, commander of the troops under Tang Juhua, commander-in-chief of the Liaodong Volunteer Army, suddenly recovered Fushun on the 11th and 12th. Most of the concession was burned, three mine shafts were destroyed, and more than 1,000 enemies were killed. More than 3,000 of our army and civilians were killed or injured. Su Bingwen's brigade in Heilongjiang Province rebelled and is besieging Longjiang. The traitor Xu Baozhen, the brigade commander, was attacked, and the Japanese army collapsed and retreated. Feng Zhanhai's troops in Jilin recovered Jilin on the first day. Governor Kui Qian died of extreme fright, and Xi Zhi escaped to Changchun by plane. It seems that the Eastern Province has fallen into chaos. I hope that you will quickly visit the elders of Liang, Ren, Pei, and Zu in Shanghai and urge the government to send troops to provide strong support. The opportunity must not be missed, and there will be no more time. A telegram has been sent, and the association has telegraphed Chen Luyang.</p>
<p>The association also received a telegram from the Northeast Anti-Japanese Salvation Association saying that according to a report from the Liaoji commissioner, at noon on the 12th, the enemy's infantry and air force, with a total of 500 people, advanced to the Tanghezi area of ​​Hongluo Mountain. Liu and Sun's troops from a certain road went to meet them and were reinforced by 300 guards from the Zhang Division. A fierce battle broke out. The enemy used field artillery and aircraft to threaten us. Our army killed a regimental commander and wounded seven officers and soldiers. One enemy aircraft was shot down by our army, and six tanks were trapped in the sand. Ma Yin, Propaganda Department of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Salvation Association, and Fuxin also sent a telegram saying that General Zhu's Jian, Yibu 9,000, occupied Faku in the north and Tongjiang in the east, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers and capturing one cannon and 300 guns. Zhang (this code is unclear) is under siege. Please send someone to Fuxin to receive assistance. Reply to Jia Bingyi Yin.</p>

<p>Yang Yijie, representative of the 4th Route of the Northeast Volunteer Army, and Liu Zongyao, representative of the 20th Route, etc., arrived in Shanghai to ask for assistance. I am afraid that it will be difficult to obtain satisfactory results, and they will fail to fulfill their mission of requesting assistance. It is planned to summon all representatives of the volunteer army in Shanghai to discuss specific methods and jointly plan to benefit the comrades in the front line who are fighting the Japanese army.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Northeast Puppet Advisor, American Kinney, Transfers from Shanghai to Geneva <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>According to the China East News Agency, the Northeast puppet government, intending to probe the intentions of various countries, has specially dispatched two American puppet advisors to Geneva to assist the Japanese delegation in attending the current session of the League of Nations General Assembly. One of the individuals from the puppet government arrived in Shanghai the night before last and is scheduled to depart Shanghai for Europe on the 27th of this month. A reporter from the China East News Agency went to interview him, as this is the first time since the establishment of the Northeast puppet government that such a puppet figure from the puppet government has been discovered on the maritime front.</p>
<p>Circumstances of Departure: It has been learned that the puppet government has dispatched a total of two puppet advisors to Geneva, both of whom are American. The one who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday is named Kinney. He used to work for the Northeast Railway Bureau, and his behavior and thinking have always been pro-Japanese, so it is not surprising that he has joined the puppet government. As for the other person, named Brabson, he used to be a consultant to the National Government, enjoying his salary while occasionally engaging in foreign propaganda for us. After the establishment of the puppet government, he was recruited by the Japanese, and he willingly became a tool of the Japanese and devoted himself to propaganda against our country. With the opening of the current League of Nations General Assembly, the puppet government has sent these two individuals to Geneva in order to probe the intentions of various countries.</p>
<p>Separate Departures: The puppet government has already decided to send the two individuals, but there was no suitable task assigned to them. It was then decided to order the two to participate in the work of the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations. After receiving the order, Brabson left first. His current whereabouts should already be in America. As for Kinney, he was scheduled to travel from Changchun to Harbin on September 11th, and then transfer via the Siberian Railway to Europe. With his itinerary set, Kinney, along with Mr. Pan Lingdun, a reporter stationed in Changchun for the London Daily Mail, set off from Changchun on that day in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Ambush on the Way: Kinney and Pan Lingdun set off from Changchun, knowing that the anti-Japanese volunteer army along the way was very powerful. For safety, they dispatched many Japanese soldiers to escort the train. Unexpectedly, at 10:30 PM that night, when the train arrived at Yaomen, the tracks there were suddenly sabotaged by the volunteer army, and the train derailed. At that time, the train was brightly lit, while the outside was extremely dark. The volunteer army took advantage of this natural assistance and immediately shot and killed the Japanese soldiers in the train from the dark. They then boarded the train to search. Kinney, at this time, also tried to escape. He found a burlap sack on the way and used it to cover himself, walking on foot to Harbin. His original plan to go to Europe via Siberia was changed due to fear of the volunteer army's strength. He changed his plan to go from Harbin to Dalian, and from Dalian, he took a ship to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Puppet's Talk: This puppet advisor under the puppet government arrived in Shanghai on a Japanese ship, the Fengtian Maru, from Dalian the day before yesterday afternoon. According to what he told the reporter, he will stay in Shanghai for three days and then leave Shanghai on the 27th of this month on the Japanese ship Saww Maru for Europe. He also talked about the experience of being ambushed by the volunteer army on the way, saying that on the afternoon of September 11th, he and his friend Pan Lingdun traveled from Changchun to Harbin. At 10:30 PM that night, after two-thirds of the journey had been completed, the tracks were suddenly sabotaged by the volunteer army near Yaomen, and the entire train was surrounded. All the Japanese soldiers on the train were killed. His compartment was shot at more than fifty times, but fortunately, he lay down and was not injured at first. When the volunteer army boarded the train to search, he jumped off, lay in a ditch, and then jumped into the sorghum fields. After the volunteer army retreated, he found a military uniform left by the volunteer army, covered himself, and escaped.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Tragic Flood Situation in Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Water Depth in Jilin Province Reaches Fourteen to Fifteen Feet</p>
<p>Heilongjiang Province Suffers Even More, Turning into a Vast Swamp</p>
<p>Incalculable Loss of Life and Property</p>
<p>According to the flood investigation report from Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, there are over 40,000 flood victims in Yilan County, Jilin Province, with a shortage of food. In Weihe County, 7,000 to 8,000 houses were washed away, and the total property loss is estimated to be over 3 million. In Harbin, the water depth reached fourteen to fifteen feet. The local Red Swastika Society and other organizations have successively rescued and accommodated over 23,260 flood victims. About 80,000 to 90,000 flood victims have sought refuge on high ground. Over 100,000 people, unwilling to abandon their goods and property, remain in buildings. The flooded area in Heilongjiang Province is even wider, and the disaster is even more severe. Counties such as Longjiang, Qinggang, Yalu, Nehe, Gannan, Hulan, Tonghe, and Mulan have all turned into vast swamps. The loss of life and property is incalculable. People are displaced and starving, a scene too tragic to describe. The Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees, composed of various charitable organizations in this city, is the most trusted and has the longest history of handling charitable affairs. It is reported that the association has decided to provide urgent relief to the most severely affected disaster areas in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and will publish announcements to appeal to people of all nationalities at home and abroad who are eager to help others and who can transcend regional boundaries and join forces to provide assistance enthusiastically. This is not only good news for the disaster victims in the two provinces but also what the people of the country yearn for and pray for.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Preparations for the Municipal National Goods Exhibition <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Goods Exhibition has been decided to be held at the Penglai Market on October 10th, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now heard that there are three main sections: internal display and exhibition, temporary market, and recreational activities. The general public believes that this is a good way to promote national goods and to seek sales for various national goods manufacturers. The exhibits in the internal display section can be freely retrieved by the manufacturers from the date of the exhibition's closing. The temporary market will be arranged by the organizers with electricity and running water, and participating merchants will select their own responsible persons to compete for sales on site. The recreational activities section will feature voluntary performances of songs and dances by outstanding experts from reputable girls' schools. The spoken drama section will be voluntarily participated in by reputable playwrights. An advertising section will be added, and a special publication will be printed for the publicity of various manufacturers. Manufacturers who wish to display exhibits or participate in the temporary market are welcome. The recreational activities section will not charge admission fees. Anyone who purchases national goods at the venue will be entitled to a voucher for the recreational activities section. The recreational activities section can use the voucher to welcome visitors to the venue. This promotion of national goods is funded by a special appropriation from the municipal government, purely for the benefit of the national goods manufacturers themselves and to cultivate the public's psychology and habit of loving and using national goods, mutually encouraging and praising the spirit of national independence. Chairman Lin of the National Government pays extreme attention and has specially inscribed the words "Enriching the Country and Benefiting the People." On the opening day, Mayor Wu will invite various agencies and organizations to participate in the ceremony. It is truly an unprecedented exhibition. In recent days, various manufacturers have been rushing to register for the sake of the honor of their own products.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Post-War Reconstruction Funds for this City <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Distribution Plan for 270,000 Dollars Determined</p>
<p>The Zhabei, Wusong, Wan, Yinhang, Pengpu, Yinxiang, and Zhenru districts of this city have suffered enormous losses since the war. The municipal government, in order to plan for the restoration of normalcy in the Wusong and other districts, had requested the National Government's Shanghai War Zone Reconstruction Committee to allocate funds for relief. The committee has approved an allocation of 250,000 dollars to be distributed by the Municipal War Zone Reconstruction Committee. This was brought up for discussion at the 11th meeting on the 22nd and the following decisions were made:</p>
<p>Distribution Plan: (1) Petty loans for the poor: 45,000 dollars. (2) Housing construction loans: 123,000 dollars. (The above two items will have 20,000 dollars withdrawn to be used as relief funds for secondary schools in the city affected by the disaster.) (3) Small industry loans: 40,000 dollars. These loans will be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau's General Loan Office and are specifically for small industries affected by the war and unable to continue operating, with loans of up to 500 dollars.

Charitable organizations in the war zone, such as the Second Vagrant Rehabilitation Center and the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, have been destroyed and have no funds to repair them. In order to ensure the continuation of charitable activities, this loan is specially set up to meet the needs. The number is not temporarily limited and will be determined after reviewing the needs of the requesting organizations. It will be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau's General Loan Office, and the procedures will be determined separately. (5) Zhabei porridge distribution expenses: 10,000 dollars. (6) General Loan Office start-up expenses: 7,000 dollars. The General Loan Office's regular expenses are not included. The equipment expenses for the General Loan Office are 505 dollars, and the equipment expenses for the seven branch loan offices are 1,050 dollars. The estimated printing expenses for two years are 5,044.46 dollars. (7) Relief funds for secondary schools in the city affected by the disaster: 40,000 dollars. The total of the above seven items is 270,000 dollars.

<h3 id="e145">Verdict in the San You She Labor-Capital Lawsuit Announced <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Original Lawsuit and Counter-Lawsuit Both Dismissed, Litigation Costs Borne Separately</p>
<p>General Labor Union Committee Visits Mayor to Request Prompt Handling</p>
<p>The factory shutdown dispute at the San You Industrial Society in Yinxiang Port, Hudong, was arbitrated by the Municipal Government's Arbitration Committee. The labor side expressed that they would accept it with pain, while the capital side declared their objection and filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting three points: (1) That the 20th arbitration decision made by the Shanghai Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee on September 1st of this year be abolished. (2) That it be confirmed that the original workers of the San You Industrial Society's Yinxiang Port factory have already been dismissed, and that the defendant hand over the occupied parts of the factory and equipment to the original plaintiff for acceptance. (3) That the litigation costs be borne by the defendant. The court hearing was held on the 21st of this month, and both parties hired lawyers to appear in court for defense. The labor side also filed a counter-lawsuit, requesting compensation for losses during the shutdown period. The presiding judge announced that the verdict would be announced on the 24th (i.e., yesterday). Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Gong Yuting and Zhang Youhai, the legal representatives of the 7th District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, along with more than ten workers who had attended the hearing, appeared in court at 10 AM to await the verdict. The plaintiff did not send anyone to the court. Judge Zhao Shulan, Judges Wang Run and Wang Shicheng, along with the clerk, took their seats in the Sixth Civil Court and announced the verdict: the plaintiff's lawsuit and the defendant's counter-lawsuit were both dismissed, and the litigation costs were to be borne separately. The written statement of reasons will be delivered to both parties within three days.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Shanghai General Labor Union, due to the capital side of the San You factory not complying with the arbitration and defying the orders of the Party and government agencies by refusing to pay the workers' food allowances, which have been unpaid for four periods, resulting in the entire workforce facing starvation and in an extremely critical situation, members of the union, Zhu Xuefan, Shao Xubai, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, and Zhao Zhenyao, together with Xia Zhongzhao and Bao Boyi, representatives of the 7th District Cotton Workers Union, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 10 AM yesterday. Mayor Wu personally received them. The representatives stated their intentions, saying that although the capital side's defiance of the arbitration decision by filing a lawsuit in court was scheduled to be decided today (i.e., yesterday), it was difficult to determine when it would be resolved. The prolongation of the dispute was causing great anxiety, and the capital side had also taken the opportunity to stop paying food allowances, causing the workers to face the fear of starvation. If a prompt solution was not found, it would lead to unfortunate incidents, so they asked the mayor to pay attention to it. Mayor Wu replied that the municipal government was waiting for the court's verdict on the San You case, and after the court's verdict, the municipal government would strictly enforce it. As for the capital side's suspension of workers' food allowances, the municipal government also had a solution and would definitely not allow the workers to starve. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Large Shipment of Opium Seized on the "Jiangda" Steamer <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Opium and Morphine Concealed in Syrup Barrels</p>
<p>Customs Officials Thoroughly Investigating the Case</p>
<p>The "Jiangda," a steamer operated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Yangtze River route, arrived in Shanghai from Hankou the other day. During the unloading of cargo that evening, dockworkers attempting to steal goods discovered a large quantity of opium and a significant amount of morphine concealed in the syrup barrels being transported on the steamer. A secret report was made to the Customs House, and together with Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Police, they searched warehouse number 16 at Jinliyuan and found 53 large syrup barrels. Except for two barrels that were completely full of syrup, the remaining 51 barrels were all filled with morphine and opium. All of the contraband was seized and temporarily stored in the Customs House warehouse. An investigation is currently underway to identify the main culprits involved in the opium smuggling. The detailed information obtained through investigation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Discovery of Opium: The "Jiangda" steamer arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM the other day and docked at the Jinliyuan wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. The unloading of cargo was not completed until 3:15 PM, and all the goods were stored in warehouse number 16. At that time, a group of dockworkers pried open one of the many barrels with iron tools and discovered opium concealed inside. This was noticed, and a secret report was made to the Customs House.</p>
<p>Customs Seizure: After receiving the report, the Customs House immediately dispatched a large team of customs officers to conduct an inspection together with Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station. They indeed found opium fully packed in the syrup barrels and seized all of it, totaling as many as 53 barrels. Except for two barrels that were purely filled with syrup, the remaining 39 barrels each contained 20 catties of opium. There were also 12 barrels of morphine, with a combined value of approximately $1.5 million. After verifying the quantity, they were immediately transported to the Customs House warehouse for temporary storage.</p>
<p>No Consignee Found: After the incident, the Customs House checked the markings P.E.H.T. on the 53 barrels. The customers who came to pick up the goods did not have names or numbers, and they used a bearer bill of lading. Therefore, it was impossible to thoroughly investigate whose goods they were. Furthermore, the opium dealers were quite cunning. They knew that the Yangtze River area was not a sugar-producing region, and they pretended to be customers returning goods, hoping to deceive the inspectors. They initially did not expect their scheme to be ruined by the theft of dockworkers.</p>
<p>Attempt to Claim Reward: Since the incident occurred, there has been much speculation in society. Some say that when the opium and morphine were transported from Yichang to Hankou, an informant disguised as a passenger boarded the "Jiangda" steamer and followed it. When the steamer arrived in Nanjing, the informant disembarked first, took the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to Shanghai, and then reported to the Customs House. However, whether this is true is difficult to say. But yesterday, someone went directly to the Customs House, hoping to receive a reward of three-tenths of the value of the goods. At that time, the Customs House, for the sake of caution, specifically questioned the person claiming the reward about the markings on the goods to see if they matched. The person claiming the reward was unable to answer. Therefore, the Customs House did not pay the reward.</p>
<p>Steamship Company Investigation: The reporter, in view of the importance of this case, made detailed inquiries to all parties. However, it was never determined who transported the opium. It was said that the main transporter was a Mr. Liu, and the contents were jointly funded by more than 20 major shareholders. This was the third or fourth time it had been transported to Shanghai. Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the company was not responsible for the opium because there were shippers and bills of lading from various sources. It was heard that an investigation had been launched in Hankou to find the shipper, and the truth would soon come to light.</p>
<p>Western Media Coverage: The North-China Daily News reported that customs officials seized a large quantity of opium in the French Concession yesterday, worth between $250,000 and $500,000. There were a total of 50 barrels, weighing approximately 145 piculs, or 6 tons. They were escorted by the police of the French Concession and the International Settlement to the Customs House warehouse. The opium appeared to have been transported from Hankou a few days ago, declared as sugar, and delivered to a bank in the city. Initially, no one suspected anything, so it was treated as ordinary cargo and temporarily stored in the French Concession warehouse. Yesterday, when dockworkers went to move it, one barrel fell to the ground and broke open, scattering opium all over the ground. Although there was a layer of sugar on the outside, the smell of opium quickly spread. One dockworker first went to inspect it, and other dockworkers followed, vying to take some. This was noticed by the customs officers, who stepped forward to stop them but were beaten by the dockworkers. They rushed to report to the French Concession Police and the Customs House. When the police arrived, there were already more than a hundred gangsters at the scene, making a lot of noise. The police dispersed them and surrounded the opium barrels. Later, Shi Kushi, the leader of the Customs investigation team, arrived with his men. After inspection, it was confirmed that it was all opium. He summoned five or six cars to transport the 50 barrels in batches, escorted by the French police to the Yangjingbang, and then escorted back to the Customs House by the police of the International Settlement. It was not yet clear last night which steamer transported the contraband. The relevant authorities of the Customs House are currently conducting a thorough investigation. According to the Continental Times, customs officials cracked down on a large amount of opium worth $1 million at the Jinliyuan wharf yesterday afternoon. It was packed in 50 wooden barrels, each weighing approximately 700 pounds. It was unloaded from the "Jiangtian" steamer. A dockworker mistakenly believed it was sugar and broke open a corner of the barrel, intending to steal some, and discovered that it was opium. He reported it to the police. It is said that the opium was loaded onto the steamer in Tongzhou and is estimated to total 430,000 ounces, worth no less than $1 million at a market price of $2.40 per ounce.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Huang Yimei, Son of Martyr Huang Xing, Kidnapped <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Held Captive by Bandits in Huanglong Mountain</p>
<p>Huang Yimei, the second son of the martyr Huang Xing, is a handsome young man. Four years ago, he went to France and majored in agriculture and forestry in Paris. He returned to China this summer after completing his studies. On his way back, he planned to inspect the land reclamation conditions in North China. Therefore, he set off from Paris in mid-July with three of his friends, returning to China via Siberia. They entered Manchuria, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, and went to the area west of Baotou, carefully inspecting the land along the way. In early August, they detoured to Lungkwan, intending to transfer to Taiyuan and then return south. Unexpectedly, on the way to Huanglong Mountain south of Hecheng, Mr. Huang and his friends stayed at a farmhouse at the foot of the mountain to examine the soil quality and agricultural products in detail. They were targeted by the mountain bandits, who, on the night of August 22, armed with lights and weapons, captured Mr. Huang and his three friends and took them into the mountains. The bandit leader interrogated them harshly. Knowing that Mr. Huang was a descendant of the martyr, he forced him to write a letter to his family, instructing them to pay a ransom of 20,000 yuan by September 25, otherwise they would be executed. After receiving the letter from Mr. Huang, his family was extremely anxious because the martyr had no inheritance and they could not raise such a large sum of money in a short time. They are now asking for assistance from the families of other martyrs. Mr. Huang has also sent several letters from the bandit den to a certain Central Committee member in Shanghai, begging him to find a way to rescue him and quickly remit the money to Zeng Shize at 35 Shuanglong Lane, Dadongmen Street, Taiyuan (Zeng is Mr. Huang's uncle). Because he is on Huanglong Mountain, he cannot handle it directly. If the money is sent to his home, it is too far from the bandit den.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Lu Ziqing Tragically Shot and Killed by Kidnappers <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Lu Called for Help After Being Kidnapped</p>
<p>Bandits Shot Him in a Panic</p>
<p>Lu's Energy Weakened, and He Died from His Injuries</p>
<p>The Chauffeur's Life Can Hopefully Be Saved</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, an attempted kidnapping and shooting of the victim occurred near Kunming Road and Liaoyang Road. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Lu Ziqing's Business: The victim, Lu Ziqing, courtesy name Jiupeng, was 48 years old and from Ningbo. He lived at 24 Fen'an Lane, Huade Road, and was the manager of the Huada Foreign Firm at 6 Sichuan Road. He also engaged in real estate and recently established the Huadong Iron Factory at the corner of Zhaobang Road and Kunming Road, hiring technicians to assist with everything. Every morning, before going to the Huada Foreign Firm, Mr. Lu would always accompany his eldest son, Jiankang, 21 years old, in his own yellow Chevrolet car, number 10035, to the factory to inspect it. He personally handled all the affairs in the factory. His chauffeur was Lu Dalong, from Yangzhou, 33 years old.</p>
<p>Bandits Asked for Help with Guns: At around 9:00 AM yesterday, Mr. Lu still accompanied his eldest son and engineer Sun Xuetang in his own car to the factory as usual to inspect it. He was about to leave when Mr. Ding, a foreman, came forward to discuss matters with Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu stopped to talk. After a few words, four thugs suddenly jumped out from outside the door, each holding a handgun, and said to Mr. Lu, "Friends, help us." Seeing that something was wrong, Mr. Lu knew he had encountered kidnappers and quickly jumped into the car. The chauffeur, Lu Dalong, also quickly started the engine and drove off. His eldest son, Jiankang, and engineer Sun Xuetang were fortunate to have been warned by another cement worker and stopped them from going out, thus escaping the disaster.</p>
<p>The Chauffeur Was Dealt with First: The car had not gone more than a few yards when it was chased by the bandits. They intimidated the chauffeur with guns and ordered him to stop. The chauffeur had no choice. Seeing that the bandits were all on foot, he secretly locked the engine so that the car could not move and hid the key in his pocket. When the bandits approached the car, they ordered the chauffeur to hand over the engine key. Lu Dalong replied that it was in the factory and he had to go to the factory to get it. Upon hearing this, the bandits began to search the chauffeur's pockets. Lu Dalong desperately covered his pockets. The bandits drew their guns and fired three shots at his head and waist. The chauffeur immediately fell into the car. One of the bandits got into the car, pushed him to the side of the road, and drove the car westward.</p>
<p>The Victim Shot While Calling for Help: Mr. Lu was guarded by three bandits beside him. Seeing that his chauffeur was injured, he shouted for help in the car. The three bandits covered his mouth. When the car reached the intersection of Binyang Road, Mr. Lu saw a uniformed police officer and two plainclothes detectives coming towards him about 200 yards away. He bravely shouted for help. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits fired two shots at the top of Mr. Lu's head, pushed him out of the car, and drove away quickly. The detectives heard the gunfire and saw someone falling out of the car. They rushed forward and saw that Mr. Lu had fallen in a pool of blood, barely breathing. At the same time, Mr. Lu's chauffeur was found nearby. They rushed to send the injured master and servant to Tongren Hospital for treatment and reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station. The police station immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and search for the missing car, which was found near Jiangwan Road and North Sichuan Road at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Master Died, but the Servant Could Still Be Saved: Lu and the chauffeur Lu Dalong were sent to Tongren Hospital by the Yulin Road Police Station. The hospital immediately gave them emergency treatment and found that the bullet was still lodged in Lu's skull, making it difficult to remove for the time being. Due to Mr. Lu's age and weakened energy, he died from his injuries at 5:00 PM yesterday. The hospital reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station. The police station sent the corpse car to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road for examination. Mr. Lu left behind a wife, a concubine, eight sons, and one daughter. His eldest and second sons were born to his first wife. His second son, named Kuan, 15 years old, is currently studying at Guanghua University. The chauffeur Lu Dalong was injured in the face, back, and buttocks in three places but is not in serious danger. The bullet has been removed by the hospital, and his life can hopefully be saved. The police station is paying close attention to this case. After a day of investigation yesterday, they have made some progress.</p>

<p>Also Said He Was Ashamed to Be Shot</p>
<p>Asked the Judge Not to Publish It in the Newspaper</p>
<p>Chen Huiging, a kidnapper from Yancheng, 36 years old, was found to have conspired with accomplices to kidnap Yan Yutang, a real estate businessman with number 58 Jiangxi Road, at around 9:00 AM on May 4th of this year, while the victim was riding in his private car number 8967 to an office. He was arrested by Chief Detective Liu Zhaokui and others from the General Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, he was sentenced to death and reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. He was ordered to be executed. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Puzeng came to the execution court and ordered the police to bring the prisoner Chen forward. He asked if he had any last words and wrote a letter to his family. According to Chen Huqing's confession, he had already written a letter to notify them. Now I have been deceived by evil friends and committed this unfaithful, unfilial, unkind, and unjust act. Therefore, I have placed my parents, wife, and children outside my heart. Only in the police station is there a gold watch worth $70, which I now ask the court to send a letter to my relative Liu Jisheng at number 427 Kangti Road in the French Concession on my behalf. He finished speaking with a bitter smile, lamenting that his mind was already confused and repeatedly touching his forehead with his hand, unable to speak. Judge Shen ordered the Chinese and foreign police to take him down, along with the photos and the entire case file, and escort him to the execution ground of the Second Prison in Caohejing in a car. At the same time, he sent a letter to the local court, instructing Inspector Chen Dai to bring the bailiffs Gu Hanqing, Wang Jianqing, Gao Jinsheng, Zhou Lianghua, and Xiong Dingchen to the execution ground. The prisoner confessed that he was 36 years old and from Yancheng, and requested that a letter be written to Liu Jicheng on Kangti Road, asking him to tell his wife to raise his two-year-old child and never forget his parents-in-law. I am very ashamed to be shot today and ask the judge not to publish it in the newspaper. Our country's national power is declining. I hope that the people of the country will love their country and struggle, etc. The official ordered the execution, and the execution bailiffs took the prisoner down for execution. The body was taken away by the hall for collection.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Silk Factory Strike Expanded, Concession Area Joined the Strike <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Fulun Silk Factory Strike Was Quickly Resolved</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Sent Personnel to Mediate</p>
<p>More than 9,000 female workers in the silk factories in Hongkou suddenly announced a general strike the day before yesterday morning. Party and government agencies are sending personnel to investigate and mediate. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the silk factories in the three districts and the Fulun Shuanggong Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road also joined the strike, and the situation is quite serious. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Continued Strike: About 12 silk factories in the Hongkou district, such as Chengxiang Chengyuanfeng, etc., with more than 9,000 female workers, requested an increase in wages and a reduction in working hours. Since the general strike was announced the day before yesterday morning, all work in the factories has been completely stopped. Yesterday, the factories did not sound their whistles, and most of the female workers stayed at home, waiting for a resolution. A reporter from the Dagong Daily went to inspect each of the factories yesterday afternoon and saw that work had stopped in each of the factories and there were no workers gathering in front of the factory gates. The situation was quite quiet. The factories still insisted on refusing the demands. Otherwise, they would rather open the factory.</p>
<p>Three Districts Joined: Yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, many female workers at the Yuyuan Silk Factory on Guoqing Road prevented workers from entering the factory, so only 60% of the workers went to work. Seeing the tense situation, the factory owner released all the female workers in the factory. After leaving the factory, the female workers went to the Chuxin Silk Factory on Manzhou Road and continued to the Longyuan Xuxiang Jingwei Runchang and other silk factories on Arabassatur Road. The female workers of each factory automatically stopped working and went out to join the strike. The factories also stopped work. At that time, the order was in chaos throughout the area. The police station immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to suppress the situation. The Silk Industry Union of the Three Districts sent personnel to persuade the workers. The female workers put forward four conditions: (1) Restore wages of six cents, (2) Working hours must not exceed eleven hours, (3) Reissue the previously deducted big ocean subsidies, and (4) Restore the Sunday reward. The union representative promised to submit a petition to the party and government to negotiate with the capitalists. It was not until 8:00 PM that the female workers began to disperse gradually.</p>
<p>Submit Petition to Party and Government: After accepting the demands of the female workers, the Silk Industry Union of the Three Districts sent representatives Yang Shumei and others to submit a petition to the party and government agencies requesting approval. The original petition is as follows: The matter is about requesting the quick dispatch of personnel to mediate the matter. The meeting reported that the factory did not comply with the mediation decision of July 8, deducting big ocean subsidies, which almost caused a labor strike. Later, the meeting repeatedly persuaded the workers and submitted a petition to your bureau, requesting that the factory be ordered to fulfill the mediation decision. After several months of delay, on the 20th of this month, after your department mediated, it was decided that work would start at 6:00 AM and end at 6:00 PM. The wages of the car washer were increased, and the previously deducted big ocean subsidies were investigated and reissued, etc. However, at a time when the price of silk in this factory was more than 200 taels higher than when the mediation was done on July 8, not only was the wage not increased, but it repeatedly failed to comply with the decisions of the two mediations on July 8 and the 20th of this month. The working hours were ostensibly in compliance with the mediation on the 20th of this month, with work starting at 5:40 AM, but secretly extending the afternoon work time to 6:40 PM. Therefore, the daily working hours have not been shortened, and are still the same as before the second mediation. Therefore, all the workers are unable to bear it, and the strike that has been brewing for several months broke out this morning, and proposed (1) restoring the original wage amount, (2) working hours must not exceed eleven hours, (3) reissuing the previously deducted big ocean subsidies, (4) restoring the Sunday reward and increasing the wages, and other conditions, requesting the union to negotiate to achieve the goal. This area's silk factory owners have always been difficult to reason with, and a special document is submitted to report it. It is hoped that personnel will be dispatched quickly to mediate to avoid the expansion of the labor strike. This is indeed a virtue. Respectfully submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>The Fulun Disturbance Subsided: Since the female workers in the silk factories in the entire Hongkou area went on a general strike the day before yesterday, the female workers of the Fulun Shuanggong Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road did not join because their treatment was different from that of the single-worker silk factories. Unexpectedly, starting yesterday morning, all 400 female workers in the factory suddenly announced a strike. The reason was that the factory had repeatedly dismissed workers without reason, so the female workers expressed dissatisfaction. Yesterday, the factory suddenly dismissed four female workers again, which aroused the anger of the workers, so they announced a strike starting in the morning, demanding the reinstatement of the four dismissed female workers. After hearing the news, the Silk Industry Union of the Fourth District sent two representatives, Dong Xingen and Lu Xusheng, to mediate. As a result, the capitalists agreed to reinstate the four dismissed female workers. The female workers also believed that the goal had been achieved and decided to resume work today.</p>
<p>Jiucheng Strike Failed: Yesterday, at noon, when the female workers of the Jiucheng Silk Factory on Changan Road in Zhabei were dismissed from work, all the female workers gathered at the factory gate to discuss the matter, demanding an increase in wages and intending to strike. The situation was very serious. Fortunately, Wu Suzhen and others were sent by the Silk Industry Union of the Sixth District to persuade them, so it was not realized. However, when work started in the afternoon, all the female workers were still unwilling to enter the factory. Therefore, the work start time was about an hour later than usual. According to the person in charge of the union, who told the Dagong Daily reporter, the union has now sent personnel to do their best to persuade the workers to wait for the resolution of the three or four districts. The union will then negotiate with the capitalists based on reason. In short, within the scope of the union, during this serious period, a labor strike will never be allowed to occur.</p>
<p>Party and Government Sent Personnel to Investigate: Since the female workers in the silk factories in the Hongkou district had a strike, the party and government agencies in this city, because the matter was serious and needed to be handled urgently, sent Zhou Lianze, a staff member of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Committee, and Wang Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Section of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, to the Silk Workers' Union of the Fourth District to investigate and solicit opinions because the strike had expanded and could not be mediated for a while, so they immediately returned to the bureau to report, intending to discuss solutions and then proceed with the handling.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Mediation of the Xiang Sheng Iron Works Dispute Still Yielded No Results <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>A New Worker Was Beaten and Injured Yesterday</p>
<p>The dispute at the British-owned Xiang Sheng Iron Works in Pudong has been mediated by the party and government, but it has not been resolved due to the persistent attitude of both parties, which has led to a strike in support of the Hefeng Shipyard. Yesterday, the factory hired new workers to work, who were beaten by the old workers and were in critical condition. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Went to Mediate Again: At 9:00 AM yesterday, Zhou Lianze, a staff member of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Committee, and Wang Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Section of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the office of Boss Pengsi on Broadway Road again to mediate in order to avoid the expansion of the dispute. Boss Pengsi and Deputy Boss Bao Naiman met with them. They agreed to reduce the number of dismissed workers from 106, but insisted on the original proposal for the rotating shifts of the small workers and the Shengda Department, which led to no resolution. A Disturbance Occurred: At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Xiang Sheng factory hired four new workers, including Yang Zhulin, who were transported by the company's steamer "Galaidisi" to the other side of the river to work. They were blocked by the laid-off workers of the Xiang Sheng factory, who severely beat the new workers, causing serious injuries. At the same time, the old boatman was also bitten in the right ear by the workers, causing blood to flow. Because there were no police officers stationed there, the workers who committed the crime escaped. Later, the factory boss sent a letter to send the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Liu Defu and eleven others went to take over the Wharf Workers' Union the day before yesterday, but Liu Defu and Xu Jianye were severely injured by a small number of workers. They were sent to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, after the doctor applied medicine and bandaged Liu Defu, he was generally out of danger. However, Xu Jianye had a high fever. According to Gu Nanqun, the director of the hospital, if there is no change within three days, there may be no danger. Yesterday, the wharf workers rushed to offer condolences.</p>

<p>Prepared to Formulate an Implementation Plan</p>
<p>The Formal Discussion Ended</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Postal Economic System Research Committee, there has been no definite research and implementation plan for consolidating the postal system. The postal workers' unions and staff unions in various places have repeatedly delayed the matter and have sent telegrams to the association requesting prompt handling. Yesterday, the Shanghai Postal Affairs Associations sent another letter to the association. The words were sincere. The original text is as follows: (Omitted above) It is reported that the postal employees of the whole country, in order to maintain the postal service, have proposed a plan to consolidate the postal base. Mr. Society and the executive officers have generously taken on the role of mediator, accepted the principles of the plan, and submitted it to the association for research and implementation. The people of the whole country have been looking forward to the association being able to obtain a satisfactory result as soon as possible. We have heard that your association is eager to end the matter and has urged the specialist committee to formulate the entire plan for discussion, which has been many days ago. This kind of news is indeed welcome to the people of the whole country, but it has not convened a meeting for two weeks, which is very doubtful. The association looks forward and backward, and deeply feels that the work of the research committee will be delayed for a long time. The people of the whole country will be anxious and will inevitably fall into the state before the mediation. The plan for now is to hope that the chairman of the association will convene a meeting as soon as possible, based on its original intention, to seek a satisfactory solution. As the saying goes, "Cultivating virtue requires nourishment, and the public and others will surely be able to suppress public expectations." I respectfully present this, and I hope that you will appreciate and accept it.</p>

<p>The Taxpayers' Association Sent a Letter to the Municipal Government to Request Negotiations</p>
<p>The Public Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association was yesterday requested to negotiate with the Municipal Government for the French Concession Municipal Council to forcibly collect land donations from Fangdan land tenants. The letter stated, "Respected Sirs, according to a letter from lawyer Jiang Zongpan, it has been claimed by Jiang Changlin of Jiang Yuji Construction Factory, who is the client. (The situation has been recorded in the newspaper of the 23rd, omitted here) It is found that the Public Concession Engineering Bureau also had the act of collecting land donations in the past, but it was canceled after the Chinese Taxpayers' Association fought for it according to law. The case is the same, so it must be fought for to maintain sovereignty. It should be requested to forward the situation to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Public Concession and quickly provide assistance. According to this, it is transferred accordingly. I hope you will check it for He. It is found that Fangdan land is in the Concession area. According to the text and spirit of international conventions, and based on legal reasoning, the municipal organs of the Concession absolutely have no right to collect land donations. The Public Concession has had the same incident. After the association fought for it according to law, it was exempted from implementation. The authorities of the Public Concession were able to be convinced by the law, which is admirable. Furthermore, the authorities of the French Concession imprisoned workers in addition to sealing, which is not allowed by humanity. According to the letter, the association hereby requests the government to quickly negotiate to protect sovereignty.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Municipal Authorities Order Telephone Company to Cease Repair of Underwater Cables <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company installed telephones in various districts of Pudong in this city, using underwater cables buried in the Huangpu River to connect with Puxi. Recently, the cables were damaged, and water entered the lines, rendering them unusable. The company previously failed to report to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, the responsible authority, and privately dispatched workers for repairs, which the Bureau promptly stopped by instructing the Public Security Bureau's water patrol team. Subsequently, the company submitted a form requesting permission to proceed with the work. However, the Bureau of Public Utilities, citing the company's repeated delays and evasions regarding the already signed temporary contract draft, and its lack of legal basis for operating and repairing equipment within the city, did not grant permission. Yesterday, it was learned that the company had sent a letter to the Bureau of Public Utilities, stating, in essence, that if permission to repair the cables was not granted, the Bureau should be held responsible for the impact of the delay in restoring public services. The Bureau, regarding this as a result of the company's delay in signing the contract, responded severely, stating that the company should bear full responsibility. It also instructed the water patrol team to maintain strict surveillance throughout the night to prevent the company from secretly repairing the cables and urgently submitted a report of the situation to the Municipal Government for review. The Bureau's letter to the telephone company is excerpted below: "To the Shanghai Telephone Company: Your letter of the 23rd of this month has been received. It is noted that your company has not entered into any contract with this Bureau or the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. Your company has no legal basis for installing or repairing any telephone equipment within this city. This Bureau has no obligation to issue licenses to your company, and this Bureau has the right to weigh whether or not to issue them. If any impact arises from the delay in restoring public services, it is entirely the result of your company's delay in formally signing the temporary contract draft signed on October 23rd of last year, and your company should bear full responsibility. The statement in your letter that this Bureau should be responsible is without basis. This letter is in response for your information. Respectfully, [signed] Bureau of Public Utilities."</p>

<h3 id="e158">Closing Arguments Heard in Day and Night Bank Director Lawsuit <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for Afternoon of the 28th</p>
<p>In the case of the collapse of the Shanghai Day and Night Bank's Great World Amusement Savings Department, the former French Court ruled to partially reject the claims against Ye Shantao, while Zhao Qinbo, Zhou Songqing, Chen Xingwu, and others were held responsible as directors and shareholders. Subsequently, the creditors, dissatisfied with the portion of the judgment concerning Ye Shantao, retained lawyers Wang Shizong, Yan Luqing, Chen Zhibi, Dong Yu, Jiang Yiping, and others to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court, seeking to confirm Ye Shantao's responsibility as a director and shareholder. Zhao Qinbo, Zhou Songqing, Chen Xingwu, and others also appealed the initial judgment of the former French Court, retaining lawyers Yang Zhihao, Lu Shaozong, Zhang Shizhao, Wu Zhiping, and others to request the High Court to overturn the original judgment. These developments have been reported in various newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, the Civil Division of the Third Branch of the High Court, presided over by Division Chief Zhao Zhenhai, along with Judges Guo Dezhang and Fan Peien, held a hearing in Civil Court One. All parties involved were represented by their attorneys. The court first briefly questioned each of the attorneys and then ordered the commencement of arguments. Attorney Yan Luqing, representing the appellants, stated that the facts of the case had been clarified by the presiding judge and requested that the court proceed in accordance with the appellant's request. The arguments of the other attorneys representing the creditors, including Wang Shizong, were similar. Wu Zhiping, representing Zhou Songqing and Chen Xingwu, argued that his clients held positions as consultants to the Gongfa Company and received monthly "husband and horse fees." They were neither directors nor shareholders and requested that the original judgment be overturned and the claims of Jing Xiren and others be rejected. Ye Shantao was represented by lawyers Lu Shaozong and Zhang Shizhao, who argued that although their client, Ye Shantao, had previously been a director of the Gongfa Company, he had declared his resignation in 1922, which was announced in the newspapers. As for the 200 shares of stock under Ye Shantao's name, they were transferred to Ge Songxuan in September 1930. Since Ge is present and can testify, and Ye had already resigned, why does Ye Shantao's name still appear in the new board of directors roster from 1928? Lawyer Lu replied that this was likely a mistake by Huang Chujiu, but that all the account books presented were Huang's one-sided records. The court then questioned witness Ge Songxuan, who stated that he was from Hangzhou, sixty years old, and that in September 1930, Ye Shantao transferred 200 shares to a merchant, with a face value of 2,000 yuan, for a price of 1,000 yuan. The merchant bought them because he saw the potential for profit. At that time, he wanted to transfer the shares at the Gongfa Company, but the transfer was stopped because it was dividend time. This was the truth. Zhao Qinbo's son, Zeng Yu, represented by lawyer Yang Zhihao, stated that the initial judgment held Zhao Qinbo responsible as a director, but Zhao was neither a director nor a shareholder. He was merely a close friend of Huang Chujiu and assisted him in various matters, for which he received monthly compensation. He requested that the original judgment be overturned. After reviewing the statements, the court announced the conclusion of arguments and scheduled the verdict for 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month. The court adjourned as the clock struck eight.</p>

<p>Yang Quanfu's Extreme Cruelty</p>
<p>Xia Hehai, a carpenter from Pudong, lived in an unmarked rural bungalow on Qianjiatang in the French Concession along Avenue Joffre. He left for work at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday. His neighbor, Yang Quanfu, a fellow villager and plasterer, knew that Xia was away and conceived an evil plan. He dug a hole in the wall from his house and entered Xia's house, stealing clothes, ornaments, and cash worth over 80 yuan. To destroy evidence and evade responsibility, he set fire to the bedding on Xia's bed. When the fire started, he fled back to his own house through the original hole. Neighbors noticed the fire and extinguished it with water, preventing a major disaster. When Xia returned home, he was informed by his neighbors and reported the incident to the police station. Detectives, along with Wen Zhi, went to the scene for investigation. Yang was not at home, but he was apprehended when he returned home at midnight. Under interrogation, he confessed to the crime. The stolen goods, including cash, banknotes, and silver coins, were recovered and taken to the police station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. Police lawyer Gu Xixi stated the details of the case, saying that the defendant's arson and theft were extremely heinous. Fortunately, neighbors noticed and extinguished the fire, preventing a major disaster. The police are prosecuting him for endangering public safety and theft under Articles 187 and 338 of the Criminal Code. However, the police investigation is not yet complete and requested a one-week extension for further interrogation. Yang Quanfu admitted to the theft and arson without denial. Judge Tai reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned to October 1st for further interrogation. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>More than 30 tenants in Zhenping Lane along Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession recently received notices from their landlord stating that rents would be increased by 30 to 40 percent starting October 1st. The rent will be collected by lawyer Zhang Junying on behalf of the landlord. All the tenants were alarmed and immediately discussed methods of opposition. They have now retained lawyers Chen Nan and Ye Jingyi to represent the 30-plus tenants and sent a letter to the landlord, requesting the revocation of the rent increase. They also plan to issue a declaration, seeking public opinion from all sectors.</p>

<p>Court Schedules Separate Hearings</p>
<p>The houses in Xihua Lane, Fair Square, on East Xihua Road in Hongkou are owned by the Fuyuan Real Estate Company. They were newly completed in October of last year. The rent for a two-story shikumen house is as high as 40 yuan per month, while the rent for a storefront ranges from 40 to 75 taels. Due to economic difficulties after the war, the tenants are unable to afford the rent and have requested a monthly reduction, following the precedent of three-story storefronts, but without success. Recently, the property management was changed to the American-owned China Business Company, which immediately filed lawsuits for rent arrears. Separate hearings are scheduled for the 27th and 28th of this month. It is reported that the tenants believe the landlord is using the power of foreign businesses, which is detrimental to national dignity, and are determined to fight to the end. They also claim that the contract terms are entirely one-sided and mostly unfair. They have retained lawyer Wang Jishi to represent them in court and have collected evidence of excessive collection of petty rents and opening fees, preparing to formally prosecute and have organized a publicity committee to send representatives to various organizations to announce the truth and request substantial assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Marital Dispute of University Student Fang Jiali <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Initially Engaged to Miss Cai, Then Cohabited with Miss Li</p>
<p>Recently Infatuated with a Prostitute, Miss Li Has Now Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Fang Jiali, 22 years old, resides in Zhengdeli, South Chengdu Road, and possesses a large fortune. He is still studying at a certain university. He was initially engaged to a Miss Cai, but then became involved with Li Sanyuan (21 years old), a graduate of Suzhou Changhai Women's School from Wumen. They rented a house and cohabited. However, recently Fang became infatuated with a prostitute named Fengjun Laqi, abandoning Li as if she were a stranger. Li then retained lawyer Xi Ya'fu to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Fang Jiali and Fang Jiali's mother, Fang, and Zhu Lianyuan, for seduction. The lawsuit stated, in essence, that it was a case of abandonment and seduction and requested severe punishment according to the law, as well as an attached private prosecution. The lawsuit alleged that in the spring of 1930, the defendant coveted the plaintiff's beauty and colluded with Zhu Lianyuan, a fellow villager of the plaintiff, to shower her with flattery and lure her to No. 27 Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road. They falsely claimed that he was not yet married and asked Zhu to act as a matchmaker to marry the plaintiff as his wife. That night, they held a banquet to entertain the matchmaker. During the banquet, the defendants planned to intoxicate the plaintiff. They then opened room 225 at the Dongfang Hotel and forcibly raped her while she was mentally dazed and unable to resist. The next morning, he introduced her to his mother, Fang, and uncle, Fang Yixin, to show that he was not deceiving her. He then claimed that since they were husband and wife, they should cohabit, so they settled in No. 12, Guifuli, Taiping Bridge. On May 17th of that year, the plaintiff suffered from severe vomiting. The defendant suspected that she had caught a cold and instructed his concubine (i.e., Fang) to accompany her to Dr. Fang Jiacheng's clinic in Yehuali, Tongfu Road, for treatment. After Fang diagnosed her as pregnant, the entire Fang family was extremely happy. Fang instructed the plaintiff to move to No. 38, Juxingli, Beitidali Road, so that they could visit each other day and night. Meals were provided at the defendant's uncle Fang Yixin's house. They then moved to the defendant's own residence at No. 25, Zhengyuanli. On December 21st of that year, the plaintiff gave birth to a daughter, and the defendant's mother was even more pleased, naming her Meidi. Clothes and items were purchased by Fang. Since then, the relationship between the two sides has become even more affectionate. In the first month of 1932, the defendant suddenly looked worried and said that he had been engaged to a Miss Cai in his youth and that she would imminently sue if he did not marry her. He asked for forgiveness and asked to marry Miss Cai first and the plaintiff later. If she could help him through this crisis, he would never forget her kindness. The plaintiff, seeing the defendant's sincerity, agreed to save him. After the defendant married Miss Cai, they still lived in peace. However, the defendant was greedy and insatiable. Soon after, he had an affair with Fengjun Laqi of Shantou Road. The plaintiff, seeing the defendant's unbridled behavior, went to Fengjun's place to inquire and tried to dissuade him, and told his mother. However, the defendant suddenly turned against the plaintiff because she was preventing his actions, urging her to marry someone else and ignoring her. He also stopped paying for her living expenses. The act of raping a woman while she is mentally incapacitated and unable to resist constitutes a crime under Article 202, Section 1 of the Criminal Code. Deceiving someone into believing that they have a marital relationship and engaging in joint adultery constitutes a crime under Article 244 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, the second and third defendants designed to help the first defendant seduce the plaintiff and commit adultery, which constitutes a crime under the same Article 244. The plaintiff requests that the court arrest and severely punish them according to the law to uphold morality and order the first defendant to pay the plaintiff a one-time sum of 30,000 yuan for living expenses. It is hoped that this will be approved. After receiving the complaint, the court will reportedly schedule a hearing soon.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Health Bureau Inspector Extortion Case <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Qian Guisheng Fined 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Qian Guisheng, a native of this county who worked as an inspector for the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Bureau on Pingliang Road, extorted 300 yuan from 13 stallholders, including Zhang Zigui, at the Wuzhou Road vegetable market on the grounds of relocation at 2:30 PM on the 9th of this month. In the end, 222 yuan was settled, and business continued as usual. Subsequently, a letter was sent to the Bureau's Western Supervisor, who arrested Qian and sent him to the Jiading Road Police Station before handing him over to the First Special District Court. According to his confession, all the money was handed over to a Western official named (Nong). He was ordered to summon the Western official to testify. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin conducted an investigation at the Criminal Division Four. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the order to move the vendors in the Wuzhou Road vegetable market upstairs was indeed issued. Later, the vendors requested the Health Bureau to cancel the decision. The (Nong) Western official wrote a letter to the director, canceling the previous proposal on the 7th. The vendors paid the money on the 9th. According to (Nong), he had not seen the defendant since he went on leave. The Western official was present in court and requested to be questioned. According to (Nong), he was British and an inspector at the Pingliang Road Health Bureau. At the time, the vendors went to the office and talked to the defendant, and he knew a little. However, the money obtained by the defendant was not handed over to him. When questioned, Qian Guisheng insisted that the order to relocate the vendors was issued on the 5th. At that time, the vendors went to the office to request help. Nong said he would find a way. On the 7th, the director ordered the cancellation of the order. He then asked him to go to the Wuzhou Road vegetable market to collect the money. In the afternoon of the 9th, (Nong) had his chauffeur drive to the court, picked him up, and handed over the money near the entrance of the court. He had only been working at the Health Bureau for two weeks. The Western official called him foreman. Police lawyer Zhang said that the defendant's attitude was unrepentant and questioned the Western official for a long time. Considering the situation, (Nong) was very suspicious, but the defendant did not have the ability to embezzle the money. The crime of dereliction of duty charged by the police seemed illegal and requested a lighter sentence, suggesting that the defendant was a dupe. The defendant also retained lawyer Zheng Wenkai to defend him. The court questioned each of the vendors whether they wanted to recover the money they had worked hard to earn. They replied yes. Judge Fu then sentenced Qian Guisheng to a fine of 200 yuan. If he could not pay, he would be imprisoned at a rate of three yuan per day. The number of days of detention would be offset by three yuan per day. He was ordered to return 222 silver coins to the vendors and post a 500-yuan bond for release.</p>

<p>At Dong Xiaomao's vegetable garden near the Diaochiaotu outside Baoshan's South Gate, four or five robbers speaking with a northern accent suddenly arrived at around 2:00 AM the day before yesterday. Armed with sharp weapons, they threatened Dong's family members to remain silent. They robbed the people nearby of their money and went to Dong's aunt's side, taking four or five taels of gold and silver jewelry, worth about 300 to 400 yuan. The elderly woman, over fifty years old and from Wusong, had just returned home from Song that day and was caught in the robbery. She resisted resolutely and shouted for help, causing the robbers to stab her head four or five times with sharp blades, severely injuring her and causing her to fall to the ground. The robbers then fled in different directions. Yesterday, after receiving the news, the Baoshan County Government immediately sent personnel to the scene for investigation and ordered the Public Security Section to conduct a thorough investigation to apprehend the robbers. By yesterday afternoon, Dong Xiaomao reported to the government that his aunt had died from her injuries. The county government immediately sent Assisting Judge Bao Ruilin to the scene to examine the body. At the same time, detectives were still dispatched to strictly apprehend the robbers.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Soap Factory Worker Dies Tragically <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Xie Qijin Falls into Boiling Pot and Scalded to Death</p>
<p>Xie Qijin, 21 years old, a native of Qingjiang, worked as a worker in the China Soap Factory at No. 231 Yangshupu Road. At 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, he was working next to a soap-boiling pot when he accidentally fell into the pot. At that time, the temperature of the soap material being boiled in the pot reached as high as 160 degrees Celsius. Although the foreman, a British national named Muller, and colleague Ning Wengui were nearby, they were unable to save him. After being pulled out, he was badly burned beyond recognition. After being notified, the Yangshupu Police Station ordered detectives to investigate and transferred the body to the Fielun Road autopsy station. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Court, which sent prosecutor Guo Wei, forensic officer Wang Zudian, and others to the station to examine the body. During the public hearing, the witnesses testified that Muller, a British national, said that the deceased was standing on a wooden board next to the pot. The pot contained two kinds of soap-making materials. The deceased was adjusting the rod inward when the boiled liquid suddenly rose and fell into the deceased's eyes, causing him to fall in. Ning Wengui testified that he and the deceased were working together at the scene, and the Western foreman was also there, ordering them to work quickly, so the deceased was anxious and fell in. Xie Qiao, the deceased's mother, testified that she was 68 years old and usually depended on the deceased for support, so she requested that the factory provide generous compensation. After hearing the testimony, Guo ruled that the deceased Xie Qijin had died from being scalded while alive. The body was handed over to his mother, Xie Qiao, after signing a bond, for burial. The factory representative agreed to give the deceased's mother a compensation of 400 yuan.</p>

<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I am writing to you on behalf of my client, Mr. Zhu Binkui (formerly Bingkui), who claims that he read in the Shen Bao on the 12th of this month that Bingkui was posing as an investigator, claiming that Bao Muxian and others had dug up graves and defrauded foreigners of 300 yuan, and that he had reported it and ordered the police to investigate. He was shocked. Bingkui has now entrusted a lawyer to inquire, and Bao Muxian said that he did not know Zhu Bingkui, so how could he have defrauded foreigners of 300 yuan? He thinks that the investigator's investigation was inaccurate, and because the matter concerns his reputation, he entrusted your lawyer to write to your newspaper to correct the matter in order to avoid misinformation.</p>
<p>I am writing to you with the facts and hope that you will correct the matter.</p>
<p>Yours respectfully,</p>

In the Morning and Afternoon, It Was Still Seven Taels Higher, but in the End, It Continued to Rise by Five Taels. Initially, the Silver Market Declined, but It Was Not Affected. In Fact, the Futures Market of the Silver Exchange Declined and Weakened. The Stock Market Was Small and Then Large Again, so the Morning Opened Flat. Sellers Showed Courage and Immediately Fell. As the Exchange Rate Stabilized, News From Abroad That Mexico Was Buying Gold and Intended to Adopt the Gold Standard Strengthened People's Hearts. Large Households and Short Sellers Bought in a Frenzy, and the Exchange Rate Was Slightly Tight. The Price Suddenly Advanced and Suddenly Broke Through the 730 Tael Mark. However, the Cashier of the Industry Was Divided. The US Dollar Was Not Very Popular and Retracted Slightly, but Still Remained Outside the 30 Tael Mark.

<p>According to News From the Financial World Yesterday, the Silver Furnace Bought the Good Malpractice of British and Dragon Dollars, etc., at a Price Increase for Profit, and Placed It in Lu Yang to Turn It Into Silver. Because the Foreign Li Has Been Falling Recently, Exceeding the New Price of Historical Special Lows, the Individual Interest Is Very High, so They Bought and Melted It One After Another. Now It Has Been Visited by the Government, Thinking That This Melting Will Inevitably Lead to the Disappearance of Good Malpractice in the Market, Which Greatly Hinders It. Now It Is Heard That Personnel Have Been Sent to Investigate and Report. If This Rumor Is True, It Must Be Clearly Prohibited to Prevent Unlimited Restrictions.</p>

<p>Demand Is Active and Prices Rise Slightly</p>
<p>A Total of More Than 3.5 Million Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday (Nian Si Ri) the Market Situation of Various Bond Markets in the Chinese Securities Exchange, Spot and Future Transactions Were More Than the Previous Day. The Popularity of Buyers and Sellers in the Market Was Quite Lively. Although the Situation Is Still Not Greatly Improved, It Is Approaching the End of the Month and the Settlement Period Is Approaching. Spot Supplement Is More Popular and Drop Transactions Are Quite Active. Zero Households Have Received In Between. The Market Demands More Than the Supply. The Prices Are Consistent and Hovering to Rise Gradually. However, the Trend Is As Stable As Before. The Up and Down Between the Various Plates Is Subtle. As a Result, Each Rose by About Three or Four Angles Compared to the Previous Day. However, the Futures Such As the Whole Six Customs Duties and the Follow-Up Dismissal of Soldiers Only Changed by an Angle. Observing the Situation of the Bond Market, Although It Seems to Be Turning Slightly, Specially Speaking From the Ringing Image, It Is Difficult to Be Too Optimistic. Check the Spot Transactions of Various Bonds for a Total of 7,000 Yuan. Futures Were More Than 1.7 Million in the Morning Market and 1.83 Million in the After Market, for a Total of 3.595 Million Yuan, of Which Salt Tax Accounted for More Than 900,000, Dismissal of Soldiers 600,000 Yuan, Unified Tax 720,000 Yuan, and Others Were Clearer.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Cotton Yarn Market Sentiment Leans Bearish <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market experienced a morning dip followed by an afternoon rise, but the overall trend is weak. Due to unfavorable conditions, most are inclined towards a bearish outlook. Actual demand in the market is increasingly quiet, and all sectors lack vitality, except for Rongxing, which maintains a bullish position and remains unmoved. In summary, the base price has already reached a medium level. Shanghai factories have relatively depleted their existing yarn stock, leading to a shortage of newly released yarn. However, generally, people believe that although the harvest is abundant this year, the price of rice is too low, making it difficult for farmers to achieve significant economic prosperity. Consequently, there is less hope for robust yarn sales in the future, and the sentiment remains bearish.</p>
<p>People's Standard Drops Below 50 Taels</p>
<p>The People's Standard market opened with a decline due to another drop in American cotton prices, leading to an increase in sellers. Market sentiment loosened, with each contract falling by one, two, three, or four cents. By the afternoon closing, the market generally tightened, with each month rebounding by five or six cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 36,250 bales. The sales breakdown is as follows: Dachang sold 2,500 bales, Changfeng 1,400 bales, Shenji 1,200 bales, Tongsheng 550 bales, Zhijin Yukang 1,000 bales, Yuanda 850 bales, Shenda 850 bales, Xiesheng 1,000 bales, and Jifeng 600 bales.

<p>Spot Yarn Market Extremely Quiet</p>

<p>American cotton prices dropped another 20 points, further weakening market sentiment. The favorable weather conditions in the country are conducive to the listing of new cotton, intensifying sellers' intentions. A certain factory has increased its sales volume, reportedly offering over 200,000 dan. However, general retail buyers, considering the high prices of foreign cotton, and noting the significant purchases made by various factories on this day last year, are reluctant to relax their grip on the 32-tael standard cotton. Nevertheless, with the current surge in new cotton listings from all regions, the buying power is somewhat diminished.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Continues to Weaken by 3-4 Cents</p>
<p>The Zheng Standard market opened with a decline due to another drop in American cotton prices, leading to a scarcity of buyers and a softening market sentiment. Each month's contract fell by 3-4 cents. The market conditions were particularly weak in the afternoon opening, but prices rebounded by the closing. As a result, each month rose by 0.5 to 1 cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 78,500 dan. The sales breakdown is as follows: Dafeng sold 5,100 dan, Xincheng 1,500 dan, Hengde 1,500 dan, and Changfeng 1,700 dan. Jifeng bought 4,000 dan, Yuanda 4,900 dan, Rongxing 1,500 dan, and Yicheng 1,300 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Cotton (21st): The cotton market in Xihe, Tianjin, remains weak. Foreign merchants' interest is still active, with 600 bales transacted at an opening price of 23 taels. Shenbang Yuji Company purchased 40 bales, also at an opening price of 23 taels. The North River long-staple cotton market is stable, but sales have become sluggish. Hengyuan Yarn Factory purchased 100 bales at an opening price of 27.5 to 28 taels.</p>
<p>Yarn (21st): The Tianjin cotton yarn market is weak, with limited transactions. Customers are disinterested, with only Xianghe sellers purchasing 10-count Sanguang yarn at 124 taels and 16-count Baxian yarn at 130 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices initially weakened due to widespread selling, then strengthened due to support from Wall Street, and finally softened again due to hedging sales in the South. Futures prices fell by 18 to 25 points, and spot prices fell by 20 points. British cotton futures fell by 6-7 points, and spot prices fell by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 20 points.

<p>Heavy Rains in Mississippi and the West</p>
<p>New York, September 23rd: A report on the cotton market conditions this week states that raw cotton prices initially fell and then rose due to purchases by the public and short covering. Hedging activity has decreased compared to before, and speculative long positions seem to have been largely closed. Short sellers have been accumulating, and upon seeing a gradual decrease in cotton sales and a surge in buying interest, they became apprehensive. The reason for the strong buying interest is the report of heavy rains in the Mississippi River basin, rain in various parts of the East, and storms in the West. This is expected to delay the listing of new cotton and damage already open cotton bolls. Private reports mentioning the inferior quality of new cotton are still circulating. Some say that the cotton yield in the first half of September is even worse than the usual situation for the entire month. However, some also predict that the peak of new cotton listing activity will occur before mid-October, as last year, the period with the most new cotton listings and the lowest cotton prices in the fall was in early October. Hedging transactions have now decreased, and it is reported that several cotton farmer groups are stockpiling their cotton. The weekend statistics are recorded below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1931 1932 Cumulative listings this season 1,502 1,725</p>

<p>Southern Market Not Opened Due to Disputes</p>
<p>Southern Shanghai: Yesterday, the rice supply from various sellers reached approximately 1120, but the stock in Pudong was limited. Due to a sudden dispute between the rice merchants and the measuring clerks, the workers stopped measuring, and the goods ready for sale had to wait until the dispute was resolved before they could be measured.</p>
<p>New Zha: Yesterday, 56 ships arrived from inland areas. Transactions in both urban and rural areas were sluggish. Kunshan and Yixing rice prices were each down by 20 cents, and the price of new Yangdu Jian rice was also down by nearly 10 cents. Changshu and Wuxi early japonica rice prices were stable, while new japonica rice and new guest japonica rice prices were unchanged. However, water caltrop rice was scarce and sold quickly, stabilizing the opening market.</p>

<p>Imported Rice Sales Slow and Slightly Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market remained uninterested. Local business was less than 1,000 bags, and prices showed a slight decrease of 5 cents. However, sellers remained firm and unwilling to lower prices significantly. Due to sluggish sales and the continuous arrival of new rice, it is difficult for the situation to improve without large-scale customer demand. Yesterday, 300 bags of small-milled rice were sold at 8.60 yuan, and 100 bags of old small-milled rice were sold at 8.37 yuan. 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were sold at 9.40 yuan. There is not much Hunan rice in the market, about 1,000 bags of Zhejing rice, with a price difference of about 1 yuan, making it difficult to match. Therefore, sellers are unwilling to sell their existing stock. Yesterday, Fuzhou sellers purchased 150 bags of Hunan Zhejing rice at 7.55 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Standard Flour Market Stabilizes <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month generally seemed to stabilize. Although the quoted price of imported wheat was slightly lower by about 10-20 cents, the gold price rebounded sharply, and the exchange rate fell. Additionally, although the factories had confirmed orders for imported wheat, they did not try to sell to make money. However, customers were unmoved, and outsiders were aware of the situation, so everyone observed and waited, pushing against each other. Due to the absence of sellers, a few speculators made small purchases, which slightly strengthened the market. However, the total transaction volume for the day was only 190,000 bags, reflecting the quiet market. Future trends will depend on the attitude of the factories. As a result, the price for this month was 0.25% higher than the previous day, October was 0.5% higher, November was 0.75% higher, December was 0.1% higher, January was 0.75% higher, and February was 0.5% higher.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Wheat Futures Continue to Fall <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month continued to fall due to the continued decrease in the quoted price of imported wheat by about 10-20 cents. Factories continued to confirm orders for imported wheat, which naturally made the position of domestic wheat similar to last year. Therefore, most large sellers of No. 43 wheat continued to close out their positions. As a result, all market prices were unfavorable. Fortunately, there were not many new short sellers, so the decline was slightly less severe. As a result, this month was down 0.3%, October was down 0.3%, November was down 0.1%, December was down 0.2%, January was down 0.1%, and February was unchanged. The spot wheat market has become quiet again. Only 300 bags of Yaowan wheat were sold at 3 taels, 5 qian, and 2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Prices Stabilize <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to a slight decrease in the Dutch exchange rate and a slight increase in the standard gold price, the trend of the sugar market stabilized. The price of No. 24 raw white sugar remained at 14 taels, 5 qian, and 7.5 fen, with no change. The price of No. 20 medium white sugar was 14 taels, and the price of No. 18 medium white sugar was 13 taels, 8 qian, showing a weaker trend. The price of No. 10 Dutch red sugar was 11 taels, with 200 bags transacted, which was still considered popular. The No. 24 old raw white sugar that arrived in April was of lower quality. The association quoted a price of 14 taels and 5.5 qian, but due to the buyer's intention to lower the price, a deal was not reached. It is estimated that the price will be around 14 taels and 5 qian. Sales of crystal sugar have recently become flat again, but the cost of existing stock is high, and there is no intention to lower prices.</p>
<h3 id="e203">North-South Goods: Red and Black Dates Debut <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>One Falls, One Rises</p>
<p>Recently, new red and black dates have been arriving on the market. Nearly 1,000 bags of Tianjin cotton red dates have arrived in Shanghai. The initial price was 6 taels and 2 qian, which then dropped to 5 taels and 8 qian. Unexpectedly, the price then dropped again to 4 taels and 6 qian to 4 taels and 2 qian. As a result, both customer and self-operated goods have suffered losses, mainly because the dates are damp and soft, making it difficult to maintain the price. Few first arrivals here are sold at 8.5 to 8 taels. The market price yesterday was reduced to 7 taels. The price of new Jixin red dates in the Hankou market is 9 taels, and traders bought some and sell them at 12 taels. The new black dates this year are of good quality. The first few dozen bags were sold at 8 to 8.5 taels. Since then, 200 bags of customer goods and dozens of bags of self-operated goods have arrived. A small amount of customer goods were sold, with high-quality goods at 8 taels and slightly lower-quality goods at 7 taels and 6 qian. Stockholders are unwilling to lower prices further and plan to raise them to 8.5 taels. Therefore, the market price has also risen, with quoted prices of 9 to 8.5 taels, indicating a stable and promising market.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Market Price of Sun-Dried Longan Pulp Declines <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The arrival of sun-dried longan pulp from Tongan has increased recently. As the quality of the goods is not very good, sales are sluggish, and the market price is gradually declining. The previous price was 32.5 taels. Yesterday, it was reported that the sellers continued to sell, and a total of more than 100 boxes of the previous batch of goods were sold at prices that were 2-3 taels lower.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of new sales channels in the United Kingdom, British firms have been constantly purchasing Shandong Da Er Wan silk. However, the quoted prices are not high. Yesterday, Xiangmao and other firms purchased 360 bales of Da Er Wan silk from silk factories at prices ranging from 33 to 34.5 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market continued to be quiet. European firms did not receive replies to their telegrams sent last week regarding ordinary fine teas from Wuyuan and Tunxi. They have adopted a passive attitude. Only Jardine Matheson and the Russian Cooperative Association made slight transactions for tea grading. Selling prices have declined. There were no transactions for black tea from Ningbo.</p>

<p>Broadcloth Sales are Booming</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no special increases or decreases in various woolen goods and threads. The demand from Jiangxi and Chongqing sellers remained strong, and local sales were also brisk. Broadcloth sales have been particularly strong recently, with significant transactions from both local and customer buyers. Original boxes and individual pieces are being sold, indicating a promising trend. However, selling prices have fluctuated slightly because new goods have arrived, making it difficult to raise prices. Yesterday, top brands like Kongshi, Hua Ji, Hualun, Xin Zhongyong, and Lulin were still sold at 6 taels and 5 qian, Rong Kang Yong Ji brand at 6 taels and 2.5 qian, and good Chinese goods at 4 taels, 6 qian, and 7.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Metals: New Iron Wire Arrives <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the metal market was outwardly active. Sellers from Tianjin, Biaodao, Xuzhou, the Yangtze River, and inland areas were all purchasing, and transactions were brisk. However, the opening amount in large quantities was still not much. I will divide the market into sections below,</p>
<p>New Iron Wire Sells as Soon as it Arrives: New iron wire colours and patterns have long been incomplete, causing those who wanted to purchase to not be able to because of the lack of variety. Yesterday it was heard that 4 or 5 hundred units of new iron wire arrived, and those who heard the news were fighting to buy it. It is said that they have already sold out the stock. Prices for the 16th to the 20th are estimated to be 13 taels, 2 qian, and 5 fen per unit, while the 21st to the 25th are 17 taels and 5 qian. These prices are several qian higher than the previous market.</p>
<p>Egg Factories are Purchasing Tinplate: The golden wind brings coolness, and the jade dew announces the cold. There is no harm from heat damage or mosquito bites when transporting eggs, so all the egg factories are starting to operate. Therefore, the tinplate business is also starting. Over the past two days, there have been seven or eight hundred boxes ordered. The estimated price for top-grade American goods is 33 taels, the price for second-grade is 32 taels and 5 qian, and the price for small-grade is 14 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<p>Nails Sales are Increasing Greatly: Recently, sales on the Yangtze River have increased greatly, with more than 1,000 barrels opened one after another. Factory prices have increased, with each barrel at 5 taels and 5 qian, while the export price is still at 6 taels (including taxes).</p>
<h3 id="e209">Coal <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Coal Dust Sales Vary</p>
<p>Sales of Mark and Hongqi coal dust have gradually improved in recent days, with customers often loading and transporting them. Local dealers and coal briquette factories are also eager to dismantle them. Sellers from Hangzhou purchased 200 tons of Mark dust and 80 tons of Hongqi dust, and buyers from Wuhu purchased 100 tons of Hongqi dust. Local coal briquette factories took in 800 tons, and dealers received more than 360 tons. Selling prices were temporarily firm, with Hongqi dust at 9 taels and 4 qian and Mark dust at 8 taels and 6 qian.</p>
<p>800 tons of Jiaozhou white coal dust arrived a few days ago, with an opening price of 8 taels per ton. However, due to the poor quality of the goods, transactions did not occur. Sellers are now willing to lower prices to sell them. The market opening price has fallen by 5 qian per ton but still lacks customers.</p>
<p>Sales of Kailuan coal lumps and dust have been brisk recently. Loading and unloading of existing goods at the dock is crowded, and market transactions are also lively. Local silk factories and small merchants have purchased large quantities, with total transactions of more than 1,600 tons. The market price is firm, with lump coal at 8 taels and 2 qian, No. 1 dust at 8 taels and 2 qian, and No. 2 dust at 8 taels.</p>

<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Recently, this publication has been favored by fellow writers, and submissions have been particularly enthusiastic, with very elegant writing. Could this delightful trend be an unexpected result of the changes in this publication's goals? We express our gratitude for this. This special issue focuses on modern life. We did not prepare for it in advance, as we unintentionally discovered several articles describing "life" in many submissions. Remembering that life is a serious and urgent issue in modern society, Juanweng suggested compiling a special issue on "Modern Life."</p>
<p>Speaking of the hardships and complexities of life, I believe that no nation's people can compare to the Chinese. Our Chinese people's lives are truly bizarre and a spectacle of ancient and modern times. A mixed bag of narratives includes the decadent lives of high-ranking officials, the impoverished lives of scholars, the hellish lives of disaster-stricken refugees, and the lives of laborers treated like beasts of burden. During this time of national crisis, there are also the lives of compatriots in occupied territories living as slaves, the bloody lives of the Northeast volunteer army, and the fiery lives of civilians in war zones. These countless life scenarios range from the blissful experience of ascending to heaven to the miserable existence of being in hell! How can a small number of people enjoy temporary comfort while billions languish in disaster and famine? Isn't this the crime created by politics? We originally hoped for the early success of the revolution, allowing the masses to work with dedication and enjoy their fruits. How could we know that the current situation would be like this, with no hope of improvement!</p>
<p>Who would want to live this subhuman life? Who doesn't want to enjoy comfort? However, comfort is always something for the distant future. As a weak nation, we only hope for coarse clothing and simple food, where everyone can live and work in peace, without foreign aggression or internal conflicts. That would mean our collective life is resolved. Now that the national crisis is increasingly urgent, with survival hanging by a thread, we hope that a few privileged people will have a heart for helping the world, supporting the vulnerable and rescuing the needy. Don't just seek personal security, but think of the masses; the merit will be immeasurable! Consider the universally admired Gandhi. His daily life consists of bread and goat milk for sustenance, simple clothing, bare feet, spinning yarn, and praying as regular activities. How many people in the world can match his great ideals, words, and deeds? May the officials and people of our nation be firm, patient, and resilient, taking Gandhi as their master, always mindful, and acting like the sages of old, "Worrying about the world's troubles before the world does, and enjoying the world's pleasures only after the world has."</p>
<h3 id="e211">A Plea from Life <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>The World is Cold and Uncaring</p>
<p>First, let's look at the lamentations of impoverished singers in this era of deformed capitalism: "Fire camp, fire camp, faintly red, Grandpa carries water to sell shallots, Grandma churns batter for paper lanterns. Son falls ill and becomes a quack doctor, Daughter-in-law carries a bag to catch lice. Poor today, poor tomorrow, picking up brass and copper." Next, we see the burden of farmers: "Singing a song while transplanting rice, This year's harvest will fill the granary. The ox exerts effort, the ox eats grass, Officials eat rice, I eat chaff. Even the mice want a share of the grain." It's all about the country being poor and the people suffering, with the endless internal strife of warlords, which then produces: "Airplanes fly in the sky, cannons pass on the ground, Trains carry soldiers, carts carry fodder. The rich live in foreign buildings (villagers call foreign concessions foreign buildings), the poor dig cave dwellings." The continuation of natural disasters and wars, coupled with heavy taxes and levies, how can rice not be expensive? Look at "Droughts and floods make rice expensive, The poor suffer. Vegetable roots and tree bark, who cares about their taste? Beggars can beg for food, but the poor can only watch. No work to do, and people still scold them for being lazy." Thus, the poor have no work to do, leading to widespread unemployment. If they lose their jobs, don't they need to eat? But "No money in their pockets, they walk like wandering souls." Try to reason with people, but the world is cold and uncaring, so "When people are poor, they become thin and dark. Borrowing fifty cents, they get nothing. Turning back, people treat you like a thief." If they can't borrow money and can't get food, what can they do? Find "Guanyin powder" (fine clay) to eat. But it causes bloating and can't be eaten, but how can they endure hunger and cold? So, unimaginable crimes are committed one after another. Are these all their own choices?</p>
<p>The times give folk songs the above voices. How moved are we to hear them? But this is precisely what the powerful and wealthy hate. So they close their eyes, and the radio will never broadcast the cries of suffering.</p>
<h3 id="e212">A List of Living Expenses in the Capital <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>It is Not Easy to Live in Chang'an</p>
<p>Since the government moved south and Nanjing became the capital of the country, the laws of economics of supply and demand caused prices of goods, food and housing to all increase. Though there is no CPI to compare, roughly, it can be estimated that living cost is five times higher than ten years ago, and ten times higher than twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Civil servants who rely on salaries to live, since the national crisis, get very little income, which is hardly enough to maintain the most basic standard of living. How much the living expenses will amount to for each family becomes information that people would like to know. Here is a most minimal example.</p>
<p>The conditions for this most minimal example are: (1) Small family size, (2) few social engagements, (3) not modernized, (4) at most hire one maid to live thrifty lives. On the other hand, it must also (5) maintain some dignity, and not degrade to begging.</p>
<p>Government Employee Family Expenses Chart</p>
<p>Amount in Yuan</p>
<p>A. Rent 20.0 Roughly 14% on the high side</p>
<p>B. Food 40.0 Roughly 28% on the high side</p>
<p>C. Clothing 15.0 Roughly 11% on the low side</p>
<p>D. Education 15.0 Roughly 11% on the low side</p>
<p>E. Daily Sundry Expenses 25.0 Roughly 18% on the low side</p>
<p>Divided into (1) water bill 2 yuan (2) electricity bill 2 yuan (3) Snacks alcohol and cigarettes 6 yuan (4) Cosmetics 3 yuan (5) stamps 2 yuan (6) toothpaste, towel, toilet paper, matchsticks, paper and writing materials 3 yuan (7) Transportation 3 yuan (8) Summer mosquito coil and fan, winter coal fire, and other sundry expenses average 4 yuan</p>
<p>F. Maid Salary 4.0 Roughly 2.8% on the high side</p>
<p>G. Entertainment 8.0 Roughly 5.7% on the low side</p>
<p>H. Gifts and Donations 13.0 Roughly 9.5% on the low side</p>
<p>Total 140.0 Yuan (100%)</p>
<p>From the chart, entertainment only takes 5% of the expenses, and gifts are double the expense of entertainment. This is already at a minimal level. Which government employee's gift expenses don't exceed one-tenth of income? Monthly clothing expenses are only 15 yuan which are not enough for the whole family to buy shoes and socks. So the wives have to sew two pairs of cloth shoes for themselves. Food expenses are 40 yuan for a family of five. That is an average of 8 yuan per person. Outside meals will cost 12 yuan. Cooking at home is more economic. The rent of 20 yuan can only get you an old flat. Renting a new foreign style house will cost at least 70 yuan. The necessary expenses add up to 140 yuan. Only civil servants with senior positions have this income. For military officers, unless they are major generals, they cannot reach this income. How can the small clerks live?</p>
<p>Sigh!</p>
<h3 id="e213">A Reporter's Life - Fragments <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— ·Wang· Ding· Jiu</p>
<p>|The Uncrowned King's Realm|</p>
<p>I am just a nameless nobody in the world of journalism. So I call myself a small reporter, (Mr. Hesheng, please forgive my cheeky self-appointment). In my short experience, I feel that being a reporter is both possible and impossible. Now I present my personal experiences as fragments for the benefit of society, so that people can understand a corner of a reporter's life.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>A reporter's stomach is sometimes wide, sometimes tight. When there is food, it's nights of banquets in several places, Chinese banquets and Western meals, eating until one is bloated. When there's nothing to eat, one must serve the public on an empty stomach. One has to understand the stale leftovers and swallow them down. It really echoes the common saying: "When there's food, eat it hot. When hungry, starve to death."</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Reporters are like children's toys. When great figures, organizations, and businesses need publicity, they are treated as honored guests and entertained with wine and food. When they are useless, they are tossed aside. If you try to approach them, the great figures block you, organizations close their doors, and merchants shake their heads.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Reporters return from attending divorce cases in court, facing difficult dilemmas. The slightest bias or exaggeration will result in either the plaintiff cursing and scolding or the defendant getting angry. Meeting outside the court, the fashionable ladies are most impolite, cursing "kill a thousand times," even scolding "little devils"! Alas!</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Reporters fear news censors the most. After exerting all their energy to gather information, the results are unilaterally deemed unsuitable for publication. When the censor deletes something important, it feels like a prisoner being sentenced to death, filling one with resentment.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>A reporter's wife is the unluckiest. After marriage, she doesn't get to enjoy any conjugal pleasures because a reporter's life means working late into the night, leading to a life of solitude as if she were a widow. Returning home at midnight, his wife wants to chat, but he is already asleep like a log. She can only sigh in vain. Therefore, my conclusion is: Reporters are not uncrowned kings at all; they lead miserable lives!</p>
<h3 id="e214">Hong'er's Old Ox <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— ·Shen· Zhen· Yue</p>
<p>|A Scene from Rural Life|</p>
<p>It was dusk, and the blood-red sun in the west was about to temporarily bid farewell to everything in the world. Crows and magpies were singing goodnight songs in the woods, facing the setting sun. At this time, everything should be resting. Hong'er led his old ox, its work for the day completed, singing mountain songs all the way home.</p>
<p>He and the old ox arrived at their home. As usual, he tethered the old ox under the fruit tree at the corner of the threshing ground, fed it some grass, and turned to go inside. Before he even entered, he heard the little black dog barking wildly inside the door. He knew there must be a stranger who didn't usually come. He hurried inside and saw Uncle Xu from the village in front, the local bailiff, and two uniformed policemen.</p>
<p>·····································</p>
<p>"Uncle Xu, you understand, the fields have been barren for several years. Paying seven *shi* of rice, we don't even have enough to eat porridge. Fertilizer money is indispensable. The rice we borrow in the spring costs eighteen or nineteen yuan per *dan*. When we take the new rice we harvest to the city to sell, each *dan* is only worth seven or eight yuan. The money from selling two *dan* of new rice isn't even enough to pay back the debt of one *dan* of white rice. Where do you think we can get money to pay rent and taxes? If we pay the rent and taxes, we'll have nothing to eat or wear. To be honest, we only eat two thin bowls of porridge a day, and even that's hard to manage." Hong'er's father said to the bailiff.</p>
<p>．　··································································</p>
<p>"Who cares if you eat porridge or rice? If you have money, you can pay. If you don't have money, we'll go see the county magistrate together," one of the policemen warned Hong'er's father.</p>
<p>··········································</p>
<p>"Sir, please forgive me. I really don't have money to pay the rent and taxes right now. When the harvest is better, I'll pay it all off," Hong'er's father pleaded with the policeman.</p>
<p>···································································</p>
<p>"Who cares if you have a good harvest or not? Since you don't have money, come, come, come... let's go together," one of the policemen said.</p>
<p>Hong'er's father pleaded bitterly, and Hong'er's mother and Hong'er also wept and begged for mercy. But tears and snot couldn't replace money. In the end, the police still dragged Hong'er's father away.</p>
<p>································</p>
<p>It was getting late, and the sunlight was gone. The old ox under the fruit tree had eaten its fill. Hong'er and his mother were still sitting on the doorstep, crying. They hadn't even had any porridge, and their stomachs were growling loudly, as if they were also complaining.</p>
<p>···································································</p>
<p>The next morning, Hong'er's mother led the old ox to the city.</p>
<p>·············································································</p>
<p>Night fell again, and Hong'er's father and mother both returned, but the old ox was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Research on Fasting <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— ·Fo</p>
<p>Fasting, which means not eating rice or bread, is a passive and boring method. Unexpectedly, it has recently become popular like a bargain, which is quite strange.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is that, according to doctors, a physically strong person will definitely die if they starve for seven days, or at least five. If people like me, who don't eat much normally, would be even less able to withstand it. Suppose I fasted for three days, I would definitely die. According to the acting president of the Indian National Congress, Gandhi can probably survive fasting for twenty-five days, but if he fasts for ten days, there is fear that he will never recover. Yet, the Nulands fasted for over ten days the other day and didn't die. Perhaps there is a way to fast? Someone said that fasting only means not eating rice and bread, but other things can be eaten. If so, then eating things like milk and eggs every day would seem to prevent starvation forever. Fasting would become just a formality. Since I don't want to fast and don't need to study fasting methods, I know that many things in the world are not easy to do. Even just fasting is something that not everyone can do.</p>
<p>Although fasting is popular for a time, the extent of its effectiveness is very different. For example, when the Nuland couple fasted for more than ten days the other day, various important people, due to ideological connections or international relations, rushed to rescue them, exchanging letters and telegrams. As a result, they were able to avoid death and even had the hope of a pardon. This is a relatively effective form of fasting. The second case is the workers of the Sanyou Industrial Company, who, because their request for resumption of work was not granted, all went on a fast. As a result, they not only failed to achieve their goal but also provoked a paper war in the newspapers between general major entrepreneurs and the Central Civil Movement 指委會, with no results. According to a dispatch from Pune yesterday, since Gandhi's fast, many Indians have begun to fast to express their sympathy for Gandhi and his political views. It is also said that Gandhi is now on the third day of his fast and there is now a glimmer of hope, because Solavia, after visiting Gandhi this morning, announced that the issue of the right to participate in politics for the untouchables can be finally resolved today. If this is the case, then Gandhi's fast has unexpected results?</p>
<p>What I don't understand even more is that Gandhi, apart from being frugal and self-disciplined, doesn't have any amazing achievements to speak of. However, even while fasting, he still continues his daily routines of spinning and praying. From this alone, we can see that Gandhi's spirit of hard work, perseverance, and indomitable spirit has been completely revealed. In the past, Zeng Wenzheng made it a rule to write for one hour every day, even when military affairs were pressing, and he never stopped, eventually achieving great success. Now, seeing Gandhi's fast, I am even more aware that the calm attitude of great men and their achievement of great deeds cannot be achieved by mere luck. Jesus has his own reasons too.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Making Alcohol from Wood <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— ·Shao· Liang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that alcohol is made from starch, but few have seen alcohol made from wood.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>But we must understand that everything that was impossible in the past has now become commonplace, right? Making alcohol from wood may become very common in the near future, and there will be no need to be surprised. Because this is not only already successfully tested, but the cost is also very low, which is something that our country urgently needs to manufacture. So, the method of making it is written below:</p>
<p>Making alcohol from wood is successful by utilizing a chemical action. There are originally many ways to make it. One of them is to first use a bucket, fill it with very fine wood chips, and then steam these wood chips with steam for one hour. Then put concentrated sulfuric acid in the wood chips to make it expand, and it gradually becomes a starch-like paste compound and dissolves. Then put a lot of cold water in this dissolving liquid and heat it to 120 degrees Celsius, and it becomes glucose. Add a small amount of alkali to this sugar and, after neutralization, add yeast to make it ferment. Then put this solution in another bucket with holes to allow the liquid to flow down. This flowing liquid is alcohol. Another method is to put dilute sulfuric acid in the wood chips and heat it to a very high temperature, then it becomes glucose. Then use the same method as above to make this sugar, and it can also be turned into alcohol.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two methods, there is also a method of treating wood with strong hydrochloric acid. When strong hydrochloric acid is put into the wood, the cellulose in the wood is acted upon by the strong hydrochloric acid and turns into glucose, from which alcohol can also be made.</p>
<p>How can wood be made into alcohol? This is because the main component of wood is cellulose, and cellulose is formed by the aggregation of starch. If acidic substances are put into this cellulose, a chemical reaction will occur, turning it into glucose, and then making alcohol from this sugar is easy.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Qualifications Question <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— ·Jian· Lou· Lou</p>
<p>In such a large society with an excess of people, the demand for talent for positions is absolutely greater than the supply. As the pursuit of bread increases day by day, the supply of bread is only decreasing day by day. Therefore, employers have no choice but to use qualifications as a passive restriction in the selection and use of service personnel (to limit the quantity by quality). As a result, obtaining qualifications has become a prerequisite for finding work. In addition to the introduction and promotion of big figures and the accumulation of wealth for operations, one can surely obtain a superior position without any qualifications. Even for a meager meal, it seems that one must have certain qualifications to get a share.</p>
<p>Nowadays, qualifications are mostly used as the criterion for selecting talents from administrative offices to general public service agencies, and even ordinary larger companies and shops. In some places, qualifications are simply used to determine the level of positions and the amount of salary. For example, a famous large printing house in our country obviously divides employees into different levels, such as doctors, masters, foreign students, domestic university graduates, and vocational school graduates, to determine salary amounts, and cannot cross the line. It implicitly proclaims the prohibition of (those without qualifications do not enter our doors). However, the so-called qualifications here have become narrow and only refer to academic degrees.</p>
<p>Here, I am reminded of the examination system in our country. Considering the original meaning of the examination, it should of course be to select true talents and practical knowledge as the main purpose, but in fact it is the opposite. Often, the regulations for recruitment clearly stipulate the qualifications of candidates at the beginning, and the examination of academic degrees and inspection of diplomas are the first step in the examination procedure. As long as the qualifications are met, the verification is passed, and you can sneak through. As for academic knowledge and experience, you can ignore it, and the so-called oral and written tests are just formalities. For example, lawyers in our country must, according to explicit regulations, pass a formal examination to obtain a lawyer's certificate and perform their duties. However, looking at the thousands of lawyers across the country, almost none have formally passed the examination, because only obtaining a graduation certificate from a foreign university or a legally registered law school in China can allow one to enjoy the preferential treatment of (selection). Putting aside the fact that the selection system clearly contradicts the examination system, under the banner of selection, the general mixed qualifications can safely pass for true, while the general real scholars who have devoted their lives to the study of law are forever excluded from the ranks of elimination due to not meeting the regulations of selection. Can this be said to be a fair approach?</p>
<p>Although, if we carefully analyze the original meaning of (qualifications), it originally contains two meanings: (qualifications) are an internal condition, referring to true academic knowledge and experience, and (form) is an external condition, referring to academic degrees, diplomas, and work experience, etc. Therefore, when discussing qualifications, both should be taken into account, and there should be no bias. When selecting talents, it is better to choose qualifications and give up form when necessary, which is in line with the true meaning of talent selection. However, in modern society, those who have both qualifications are indeed rare, so those with form but no qualifications fill society as much as possible and take great advantage everywhere, while those with qualifications but no form have become discarded and hit walls everywhere. Remember that someone on (Life) once shouted (suffered the loss of qualifications to the full), we know that in this vast world, those who suffer the same disease as someone are not known to be many.</p>
<p>I think this is a problem that deserves attention. The current social (emphasizing form over qualifications) is a morbid state of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch, and there is an urgent need for reform. This column is dedicated to improving society, so I dare to express my humble opinions in a haphazard manner. However, regarding reform plans, my personal knowledge is limited, and I dare not rashly propose them. I sincerely hope that all compatriots can come together to discuss them, so that we can obtain a correct and practical solution. That is the original intention of my clumsy work (throwing a brick to attract jade).</p>

<p>— ·Yun</p>
<p>Night revealed its black shadow, shrouding the entire world. The autumn wind was blowing, and the street lamps cast their dim yellow light. Although the scene was bleak, the streets began to liven up, filled mostly with people who looked like workers.</p>
<p>Upstairs in a small teahouse facing the street, the sound of gongs and drums began to ring. The entrance was lit by brilliant electric lights, reflecting some seductive words: (This teahouse tonight specially invites XXX, etc., to sing XXX.)</p>
<p>So, this teahouse swallowed up many of these workers. They came to enjoy this new autumn evening after a day's work. For three hundred coins for a ticket, they could have a pot of tea and listen to local opera.</p>
<p>This low-level pleasure seems to occupy a part of their entire lives. Dance halls, movie theaters, and cafes, these urban civilized pleasures that require money, they would never think of stepping into.</p>
<p>The lively sound of gongs and drums resounded throughout the quiet universe of this autumn night. The sharp singing of women and the strange flirting of men and women on stage all constitute the unique characteristics of this entertainment venue.</p>
<p>The blue smoke, like clouds and fog, filled this popular theater. The audience's laughter and noise were also characteristic of this place.</p>
<p>The warm air was filled.</p>
<p>After half past eleven, the theater closed, and the quiet streets became lively again. A large group of spectators poured out of the teahouse and walked home in the silvery moonlight.</p>
<p>Their hearts were filled with satisfaction, and they discussed who did well and who did poorly in groups of three or five on the road.</p>
<p>The slightly cold autumn wind blew, but they did not feel cold.</p>

<p>— ·Hui· Jun</p>
<p>For those who have been to school, exams are a necessary hurdle. There are entrance exams for admission, monthly exams, quarterly exams, and also temporary exams, quizzes, and final exams of various kinds. Therefore, to cope with various difficult challenges, students who read books but don't forget entertainment and read books but don't forget love, rack their brains and carefully design schemes to deceive teachers and get scores and credits, so that they can graduate, and report to their parents.</p>
<p>There are methods of cheating, as the saying goes, (magicians all know how to perform tricks, but each has their own skills). To summarize, there are no less than the following types:</p>
<p>Distracting the Tiger from the Mountain: It is difficult for the teacher to supervise the exam, but it is difficult to guard against. For example, A and B collude. A deliberately asks the teacher to explain the test questions, diverting his attention, and B takes the opportunity to copy from here and there, or turn the book to copy the hidden items, displaying skills.</p>
<p>Division of Labor and Cooperation: Beforehand, agree with the classmates sitting in front, behind, left, and right, that A is responsible for Chapter 1 of a certain course, and B is responsible for Chapter 2. After the work is assigned, everyone works hard and prepares carefully within their defense zone, increasing the night shift. If the test questions are in A's territory, A will send someone to help other classmates, and the same will be done in B's territory.</p>
<p>Standing Guard: As soon as the test paper is distributed, immediately send a copy to a classmate waiting outside the exam hall. After receiving it, he asks a classmate of a higher grade to do it. After the answer is done, make a ball of paper, and when the teacher is not paying attention, make a wink and throw it in. If the teacher sees it, he can refuse to accept it, and there is no handle to find.</p>
<p>Dual-Purpose Hat: When encountering exams, you often see several classmates wearing baseball caps, because on the one hand, when stealing a look at the book, the gaze is downward, making it difficult to detect, and at the same time, hidden items can be placed in the hat, pretending to scratch the head and think, and you can steal a look at everything.</p>
<p>All Kinds of Hidden Items: Hidden items come in all shapes and sizes, some are just outlines, and after reading the title, you can associate with the content. These are made by students who are more willing to study. Students who do not study copy many things in tiny characters, but they are all irrelevant things. I once saw a classmate who wrote words on a blank piece of paper with a needle. On the surface, there was nothing, but the effort spent was really not small. There are also those who imagine things, write the hidden items on foreign paper, and tie them to the belt with a rubber band. When the teacher comes, they automatically hide it in a hurry.</p>
<p>The Secret of the Sleeves: The sleeves are the most convenient for hiding items.</p>
