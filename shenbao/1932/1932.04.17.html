<h3 id="c1">日本之左傾運動彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>由於資本主義經濟之轉入第三期。整個資本主義世界。已困頓於動盪恐怖杌𣕕不安之悲境。此種動盪與不安。不僅限於經濟界之體。抑且進而引起政治上動盪之狂濤換言之。即經濟危機之深刻與擴大。必進而引起政治上之危機。左傾運動。固日形激化而右傾運動。亦必顯呈最後一刹那廻光返照之現象。一時驟形抬頭。</p>
<p>日本爲脆弱之後進資本主義國家。處於當前資本主義經濟恐慌之狂潮中。自更特别感受困頓。而其國内思想界左右傾之分化。自日趨顯明爲鎭壓左傾思想之抬頭。爲挣扎其崩潰之生命。政治之轉向於法西斯蒂化。亦自更爲不可避免之事實。</p>
<p>政治法西期蒂化之特徵。一爲軍國主義之抬頭。財閥與軍閥聯成一氣。加緊其對弱小民族與殖民地之侵略。積極準備資本主義國際間不可避免之（火併）。同時更積極努力於反社會主義聯合戰綫之形成。另一即爲在國内對左傾勢力。施行更猛烈高壓以。偏隘之國家思想民族思想。麻醉一般國民激起其愛國狂熱以阻遏其左傾運動。今日之日本。即在此種情勢之下。挣扎其瀕於崩潰之命運。同時並醖釀孵育（新日本）之新生。</p>
<p>因日本軍閥之專横其政治制度雖號稱（政黨政治）（議會政治）實則（）</p>
<p>政治完全爲軍閥所操縱。由於近年來深刻擴大之不景氣之激盪。軍閥之勢力。乃愈得一伸張之良機。九一八禍變之突發即伸張其軍閥主義勢力之第一步。同時亦即開始資本主義國際競争與對殖民地再分割之第一聲。在另一方面則更積極努力於對美戰争之準備。積極努力於反蘇聯合戰綫之造成。儼然以東方反蘇聯之盟主自居。</p>
<p>在政黨方面。代表産業資本階級之政友會内閣。以代表金融資本階級之民政黨之反對。而又無以駕御軍閥。已漸呈不支之勢。而不得不以决然之手段。實行解散議會。而民政黨方面。則因基礎動搖。黨内分裂。最近且積極聯絡軍人。極力勸誘宇垣大將入黨。欲借軍人以撑持其危局。其杝如號稱無産黨之社會民衆黨。最近亦揭露其虚僞之面目。改名國家社會黨。以國家社會主義爲口號。同情於軍閥。謳歌法西斯蒂。農民勞働黨。切實聲明對莫斯科立於獨立地位。勞工黨亦顯呈傾向國家主義之趨勢。</p>
<p>至於在社會方面。則國家主義與汎繫主義更爲流行。種種法西斯蒂團體之組織。如所謂黒龍會。血盟暗殺團等。皆以發展國家思想。保存舊有文化與道德。暗殺政客及財閥爲事。自濱口死於創傷後。井匕與團涿磨亦先後被狙。此案發生後。牽涉頗廣全國爲之騷動。法西斯蒂運動之高漲。於此亦可想見。法西斯蒂運動旣日益高漲。對於左傾勢力自加緊摧殘故最近對於革命思想之取締。益加嚴重凡反資本主義及反議會政治者。皆加以嚴厲裁制增加警察力量。嚴重考察犯人思想。税關檢查對思想方面特别嚴重處理。取締思想上之人物及書籍之出入。命令宗教團體及教育機關宣傳崇重宗教及君主。總之於取締左傾思想。麻醉人民蓋無所不用其極。然而左傾運動。果足以爲支持舊日本之命運之台柱乎。革命勢力果可以取締高壓而遏止乎。此乃爲根本問題。日本之前途。吾人應亦不難推斷矣。</p>

<p>横田喜三郎謂脱離爲失策</p>
<p>並閘述日本不能感情用事</p>
<p>横田博士之意見　近來主張脱退國聯者甚多、全國輿論界甚有贊成之者、余以爲脱退國聯、毫無理由可言、蓋在法律上旣無意義、在政治上尤爲失策、不過爲單純的感情而已、從法律上言、主張脱退國聯者、謂與國聯斷絶關係、可免種種干涉、國聯不能以被告地位處分日本、此種觀念、完全錯誤、誠以日本如决脱離國聯、須經過二年、始發生效力、則脱退後二年内、日本不得不負盟約上一切義務、國聯審查滿洲事件、日本當然負法律上審查之義務、雖二年後與國聯脱離關係、然滿洲事件如過二年仍未解决、日本仍應受該問題之牽連、不能不受國聯盟約之拘束、近日主張脱退者、輙以爲加入國聯受法律上種種拘束、遇事遭理事會總會决議或勸告、不克發揮自已之意志、今若脱退、在法律上不論理事會之决議、總會之勸告、如無當事國之同意、可不受其拘束力、即全會一致、獨日本反對、當不受其拘束、如此滿洲上海問題之適用規約第十五條、亦可置之不理、特外務省以爲第十一條尚無關緊要、祗反對第十五條之適用可也、此不惟無理解釋正當之盟約、實際上絶無反對十五條之理由、蓋適用第十五條與適用第十一條性質相同、兩條之不同點、單除紛争當事國外、因全會一致之勸告、如當事國一方承諾時、當事國他方亦不得有戰鬥行爲、然日本是否有戰鬥行爲、可以明矣、從政治上言、日本宣告脱離後、在二年間、一方仍負國聯盟約一切義務、他方反喪失理事會總會代表的立塲、並放棄各種主張的機會、結果聯盟各國、單據中國片面的報告则下判斷、於是日本失却外交上的地位况各國之意嚮、與世界的輿論、頗有關係、迥憶世界大戰前之德國、國勢如何强盛、大戰時軍事的行動、如何活動、至最後竟遭在崩潰者何耶、蓋因全世界經濟封鎖爲其大原因、因經濟封鎖、無論如何强盛的軍國主義、亦不能立脚矣、今日歐洲各國、以過去大戰的經騐、一旦用最惡的手段、將如何耶、日本對外、已有深刻的軍國主義印象、對内亦積極謀軍國主義的進展、主張脱退國聯者、不外實行政策之第一步、其失策無識、達於極點、由此觀之、脱退國聯、在法律上政治上之無理由、無待再言矣</p>
<p>主張脱退論者、直接第一動機、原爲適用盟約第十五條之故、彼輩以爲國聯忽視日本之反對、竟欲適用十五條於滿洲事件、但就十五條明文所載、凡國交將至斷絶的紛争時、如不受裁判、一方因當事國之請求、當然自動的可適用十五條、日本必不能怪國聯之措置、憶滿洲事件發生之初、因兵力衝突、將陷於國交斷絶、國聯依中國之請求、自動的援引十五條、當然適用於滿洲事件日本原無反對之理由、良以日本加入國聯時、已同意於盟約、今决不能提出反對、自相矛盾、要之、第十五條之適用、爲當然不可避之事實、則主張脱退論者、必謂國聯忽視日本之主張、竟容中國之請求、其無智無謀、不明盟約原理、甚矣、</p>
<p>主張脱退論者之第二動機、以爲在國聯諸小國方面之言論、嘗以無責任之地位、非難日本、此更爲不合理之談、當意大利占領哥爾夫島時、大受小國之非難攻擊、結果意大利不得不屈服、就此種事實、可以明證、若以在總會席上、日本憤小國之非難攻擊、即提倡脱退、試觀世界之新聞雜誌、恐比在總會時小國之言論攻擊爲尤甚、國聯當然以世界輿論爲準繩、蓋世界輿論之所趨、可爲國聯之鏡、國聯藉此鏡、可以明察各國民意之趨向、而日本專以大國之面目論爲辭、僨恨小國之攻擊、完全屬於一種感情論、其不通情理、莫此爲甚、單純感情論、自不利於日本、然日本脱退國聯、將來必永久爲世界所非難、斯日本之地位、從此亦不易挽回矣、</p>

<p>附錄國聯處置中日糾紛經過</p>
<p>日本自佔領齊齊哈爾後、乃集中兵力於北寗路線、以爲進取錦州的預備、至十一月二十四日、日軍前鋒已迫近錦州之東三十分里、二十五日、我國代表乃向行政院告急、要求於錦州之西東設一中立區、由國聯派英法意軍隊前往防守、如果我國兵力不足以拒敵、則此種不得已的辦法、最少可防止日軍的西進、况且有外兵之防守、則日軍必不敢借故進攻、以與外兵爲難、惜過後數日、我國當局、又托北平法使向日本表示、如果日軍肯回藩陽、則華兵亦當撤退長城以内、遂激起國民的反對、</p>
<p>國聯方面、對於中立區的設立、雖甚贊成、但由其派兵防守一層、又遭日本的反對、結果、祗允英法德等北平使館派員前往、與中日兩方軍隊指揮、就地磋商設中立區辦法、</p>
<p>日兵想進攻窺錦州的時候、所宣佈理由、爲我國軍隊集中於錦州一帶、足以危害日本軍隊安全、白里安爲避免衝突計、二十五日致電中日政府、請命令前方軍隊信止軍車行動、二十七日、日本政府答復白里安説、假使華兵能退入肯城之内、則日兵亦可退回審陽、除必要時、得取道錦州赴華北保護日僑外、日本軍隊、當不逾過錦州中立界線、由錦州西至山海關一帶、應由中國地方政府維持治安、但由錦州起東至瀋陽一帶之治安、須由瀋陽政府維持、他的用意、爲由錦州至瀋陽的治安、當得日本管理、</p>
<p>十一月二十八日、日代表復致白里安一函、除重申前函大意外、并表示不滿國聯干涉劃界問題、其用意乃指我國當局、旣已托北平法國公使、與日本政府直接交涉、國聯若不要干涉、結果將延遲該問題的解决、第二天、白里安也曾去函駁覆、但我國政府、因人民反對、遂取消前議、而當時日外長因日后向錦州進迫、爲各國所非難、乃向日皇辭職、關東司令官爲敷衍内閣起見、遂於十一月二十九日將迫近錦州之兵撤回瀋陽、我國代表至此、亦宣言放棄定期撤兵之原則、自從十一月二十二日會議通過派員調查原則之後、國聯秘書廳及日本代表團、兩方即已分别從事决議案的起草、後因錦州中立區問題發生、遂將草案擱置、及我國放棄設立中立區要求後、行政院乃繼續起草工作、（未完）</p>

<p>當十九路軍與敵人奮勇抵戰之時難道十九路軍不挖壕麽？、何以百姓笑嘻嘻的帮助呢、難道十九路軍無供應麽？何以百姓整千累萬送去呢、總之現在的軍隊、要使百姓望而生愛、不可使百姓望而生畏、纔可爲抗日唯一的軍隊、纔算爲我們民衆的軍隊、</p>

<p>— 夢茹盦主</p>
<p>去秋馬氏江橋一戰，震爍寰宇，余作歌張之，及聞馬氏變節，此詩亦棄諸敝篋，昨閲馬氏反正一電，爲之一快，則我詩固不可以不存也，乃錄之，以核其將來，關東作賊皆豪傑，將軍馬上技尤絶，白骨成山卷甲回，一馬如龍萬馬噎，幡然虎變作干城，十年坐嘯邊塵清，豈獨雄威振殊俗，兒啼不敢聞姓名，一朝遼陽動鼙鼓，蝦夷跨海來縱横，玄莵城頭角聲死，貔貅十萬餘空營，鐵騎横馳一千里，投鞭欲斷嫩江水，將軍奮臂裂裳起，男兒報國此時矣，八千子弟從如雲，帳下歡呼各效死，巨刃在手摩天楊，會看驅賊如驅羊，九月癸亥賊大舉，飛船殷夭彈如雨，鰲翻地穴江倒流，血浴玄黄迷處所，將軍令出威如山，萬馬無聲齊出堵，黄雲下蕩旗角開，將軍一騎突陣來，赤熛射破鯨魚浪，將軍逐賊江橋上，回頭躍馬十丈高，十盪十决翻賊巢，是好男兒死此土，敢有後者腥吾刀，我氣益振賊益蹙，再接再厲無一撓，天搖地岌龍蛇走，不見賊前見賊後，四野惟聞辟歷聲，紛紛碎落貪狼首，將軍人馬皆天龍，入陣馬黑出陣紅，山河北戒獨　拄，邊功第一今誰同，吁嗟乎，一從胡騎牧遼野，七十餘城望風下，江橋一捷賊膽摧，相戒莫攖龍江馬，關河北望淚眼枯，失羣哀雁雲中呼，爲語將軍志莫渝，一心殺賊當如初，功成待繪凌烟圖，吾筆猶能一歌再歌爲君書，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan's Left-Wing Movement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Due to the capitalist economy entering its third phase, the entire capitalist world is mired in a state of turmoil, terror, unease, and distress. This kind of turmoil and unease is not limited to the economic sphere but also extends to trigger political upheaval. In other words, the deepening and expansion of the economic crisis inevitably leads to a political crisis. The left-wing movement is naturally intensifying, while the right-wing movement is bound to exhibit a last-gasp resurgence, a momentary flash of revival.</p>
<p>Japan, as a fragile and late-developing capitalist country, is particularly feeling the distress amid the current capitalist economic panic. The division between the left and right wings in its domestic ideological circles is becoming increasingly clear. To suppress the rise of left-wing thought and to struggle for its collapsing life, the political shift towards fascism is an inevitable fact.</p>
<p>The characteristics of political fascism include: first, the rise of militarism. The financial cliques and warlords join forces, intensifying their aggression against weak nations and colonies, and actively preparing for the inevitable (infighting) among capitalist nations. At the same time, they are also actively striving to form an anti-socialist united front. Second, domestically, they implement more violent repression against left-wing forces and use narrow-minded nationalistic and ethnic ideologies to intoxicate the general populace and incite patriotic fervor to curb the left-wing movement. Today's Japan is struggling for its collapsing fate under these circumstances while also brewing and incubating the rebirth of a "New Japan."</p>
<p>Because of the Japanese warlords' autocracy, although its political system is nominally (party politics) and (parliamentary politics), in reality, ()</p>
<p>Politics is entirely manipulated by the warlords. Due to the impact of the recent deepening and expanding economic downturn, the warlords' power has gained a good opportunity to expand. The sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident was the first step in expanding their militarist power. At the same time, it was also the first shot in starting capitalist international competition and the re-division of colonies. On the other hand, it is also actively working on preparations for war against the United States and actively striving to create an anti-Soviet united front,俨然assuming the role of the leader of the anti-Soviet alliance in the East.</p>
<p>In the political party arena, the Seiyukai cabinet, representing the industrial capitalist class, is being opposed by the Minseito party, representing the financial capitalist class, and is unable to control the warlords. It is gradually showing signs of collapse and has had to resort to decisive measures to dissolve the parliament. On the Minseito party side, its foundation is shaken, and the party is split. Recently, it has actively contacted the military, trying to persuade General Ugaki to join the party, hoping to use the military to support its precarious situation. The Social Democratic Party, claiming to be a proletarian party, has recently revealed its hypocrisy, changed its name to the National Socialist Party, and used National Socialism as its slogan, sympathizing with the warlords and praising fascism. The Farmer-Labor Party has explicitly declared its independent stance from Moscow. The Labor Party is also showing a tendency towards nationalism.</p>
<p>As for society, nationalism and Pan-Asianism are becoming more popular. Various fascist organizations, such as the so-called Black Dragon Society and Blood Pledge Assassination Corps, are all focused on developing national thought, preserving old culture and morality, and assassinating politicians and financial magnates. Since Hamaguchi died from his wounds, Inoue and Dan Takuma have also been targeted one after the other. After this case occurred, it involved a wide range of people, and the whole country was in turmoil. The surge of the fascist movement can be imagined from this. As the fascist movement is rising day by day, it is naturally intensifying its destruction of left-wing forces. Therefore, the crackdown on revolutionary thought has become more severe recently. All those who oppose capitalism and anti-parliamentary politics are subject to severe sanctions. Police forces are increased, and the thoughts of criminals are seriously investigated. Customs inspections are especially strict in handling ideological matters, cracking down on the entry and exit of ideological figures and books, and ordering religious groups and educational institutions to promote the importance of religion and the monarch. In short, in suppressing left-wing thought and anesthetizing the people, every possible means is being used. However, can the left-wing movement really be a pillar to support the fate of the old Japan? Can revolutionary forces be suppressed by crackdown and repression? This is the fundamental question. The future of Japan, we should not be difficult to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e2">League of Nations Special Committee Reopened Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Deadline for Troop Withdrawal from Shanghai</p>
<p>No Resolution After Three Hours</p>
<p>Representatives of Small Countries Advocate Fairness</p>
<p>Japanese Delegation Fabricates Alarming Stories</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 16th: The League of Nations' Special Committee of Nineteen held a closed-door meeting today, chaired by Hymans, to discuss the deadline for the Japanese army's withdrawal from Shanghai. After about three hours, many difficulties were encountered in setting a date. It was felt that this matter should be resolved locally by the authorities. Today's meeting did not reach a resolution. Chairman Hymans is now consulting with representatives from both China and Japan. It is now believed that the Special Committee will reconvene next week and will eventually make a decision. Once the local situation returns to normal, the Japanese army should withdraw immediately. The Special Committee members believe that when Shanghai returns to normal should be determined by the neutral country commission in the area. It is now believed that after consulting with Chinese and Japanese representatives, Hymans will propose a motion. According to a public statement, Hymans has been ordered to submit concrete proposals to the Special Committee.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 16th: This morning, the Committee of Nineteen held a closed-door meeting, chaired by Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans. Representatives from China and Japan were not present. During the meeting, opinions were exchanged on two main points: (1) The compromise reached last Saturday by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy, as well as both China and Japan in Shanghai to sign a truce agreement. Representatives from the United Kingdom, France, and Italy have telegraphed their respective governments, stating that in their opinion, this measure is in line with the spirit of the resolution passed by the League of Nations Assembly last month. The governments will then forward this telegram to the League of Nations. Today, the Committee of Nineteen studied this compromise to see if it is consistent with the spirit of the resolution adopted by the League of Nations Assembly. (2) The second issue discussed by the Committee of Nineteen was what kind of mechanism should monitor the implementation of the various clauses contained in the Shanghai truce agreement once it is established. Some parties in Japan fear that the Committee of Nineteen appointed by the League of Nations will replace the negotiators in Shanghai, but this is not the case. It is generally said that the Committee of Nineteen will hold a public meeting this afternoon, and representatives from both China and Japan will participate.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th: The Japanese government has instructed its representative in Geneva not to attend the meeting of the Committee of Nineteen. If the committee specifically invites a Japanese representative to attend, the Japanese representative may send a lower-ranking official without representative status to provide information to the committee.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 16th: The Japanese delegation sent a telegram from Shanghai on April 14 to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, stating that Japanese residents are still being beaten by Chinese. Although the Municipal Council police are doing their best to protect them, it is still unavoidable in the Public Concession. On April 13, a Japanese employee went to the French Concession and was beaten by five Chinese, most likely students, causing serious injuries. On April 14, a Japanese barber in the Public Concession was beaten by many Chinese and was in critical condition.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 15th: Today, representatives of various small countries expressed resentment after hearing British Ambassador Lampson's suggestion that Japanese troops withdraw from Shanghai within six months. They argued that the Committee of Nineteen should have a faster withdrawal recommendation. It is now expected that when the committee meets tomorrow, the opinions of the representatives of small countries will differ from those of the representatives of large countries. The small countries will be led by Spain, while the large countries will be led by the United Kingdom and supported by France and Italy. If the large countries' argument prevails and they consider Lampson's proposal to be a fair compromise, then the Committee of Nineteen may suggest that China accept this plan.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 15th: The special meeting of the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations General Assembly is now scheduled to convene tomorrow at 10:00 AM. Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans will preside. The Japanese representative has also submitted a lengthy memorandum after the Chinese representative. The representatives of the two countries' memoranda each state the reasons and opinions for the Shanghai negotiations being deadlocked. It is generally recognized here that the atmosphere of this committee meeting is slightly tense, and conflicts of opinion may occur, causing unexpected repercussions.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th: The League of Nations Special Committee will hold an informal meeting at 11:00 AM on Saturday to discuss the Far East situation, without inviting representatives from both China and Japan to attend. The memorandum submitted by the Chinese representative to the Special Committee stated that the current situation in Shanghai is still dangerous because the agreement has not been reached and peace is at risk of being broken at any time. The main obstacle to the fulfillment of the League of Nations General Assembly resolution accepted by both China and Japan is the Japanese government's insistence that the Japanese army's withdrawal into the Public Concession and the area of roads built beyond the border must wait until Japan believes that the situation has made sufficient progress to make Japanese people feel safe. At the same time, the Japanese government also insists on holding a round table conference before withdrawing troops. The memorandum puts forward the following methods: (1) When discussing the truce agreement, hostile actions must be effectively stopped, and the withdrawal of the Japanese army must be stipulated. (2) Prepare to hold a round table conference in Shanghai. (3) The Japanese army must withdraw completely by a certain date. This is part of the truce and cannot be subject to the political situation. The Japanese representative is also stating to the League of Nations Secretariat Japan's views on the failure of the Shanghai negotiations. This document will also be submitted to the Special Committee. The Japanese representative's letter states that the only difficulty that still exists is the issue of the date for the Japanese army to withdraw into the Public Concession and the area of roads outside the border. Because of the current situation, China is responsible, and the Japanese authorities cannot predict the exact date for the withdrawal of troops. However, the Japanese government, in view of the efforts of friendly country representatives and the fact that this kind of problem can only be resolved through local negotiations, still hopes that an agreement can be reached in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Army in Western Shanghai Prepares for War <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the Chinese army was forced to take defensive action due to the Japanese army's more alarming activities on the north bank of the Suzhou River. Therefore, on Thursday morning, it sent a reconnaissance team to the area of Robison Road on the banks of the Suzhou River to investigate the Japanese army's movements. After learning that the Japanese soldiers had not entered the south bank, they returned. There has been no movement in the positions of the Chinese army. According to people in the Chinese army, the Japanese army has recently made repeated provocative attempts in order to restart hostile actions so that it can advance south of the Suzhou River in preparation for invading the southern city. In the past week, every morning at 10:00, a Japanese aircraft has flown over the Suzhou River, scouting the terrain at low altitude, penetrating deep into the southern city and returning. On Wednesday morning, someone was seen on Robison Road, where a team of Japanese soldiers, disguised as merchants and beggars, each carrying weapons, mingled into the crowd and left. These people seemed to have crossed the river near the coal kiln and wanted to scout the terrain in the south of the river. In addition, the Japanese army in the western part of Shanghai was seen busy preparing for war yesterday (the 15th) after the morning. Therefore, the Chinese army had to pay close attention to the movements of the Japanese soldiers. Furthermore, yesterday, reporters from this newspaper also saw Japanese sailors and White Russian workers digging trenches on Jiangwan Road, Tongji Road, Baziqiao, Chenjia Garden, Zhonghua Xin Road, and 63 Garden, and they were very busy. Residents of Zhabei were terrified by this action of the Japanese soldiers, so they fled into the concession again. It was also heard that the Japanese army was building barracks in Wusong, which are almost complete. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers with two machine guns are stationed in front of one of the barracks for defense. At present, all schools in Wusong, such as the Fisheries School, China Public School, Tongji University, Merchant Marine School, and Medical University, have been occupied by the Japanese army. This time, the Japanese army transport ship Kajimasan Maru came to Shanghai, and another 900 Japanese soldiers were transported to Shanghai. They landed at the Wusong Grain and Rice Warehouse Pier at around 8:30 in the morning.</p>

It is heard that the foreign affairs office has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate and take action.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Japanese Aircraft Crashed Yesterday Morning <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Pilot Safe, Aircraft Destroyed by Fire</p>
<p>The "大美晚报" reports that this morning (16th), a Japanese army aircraft was flying in the sky. Due to engine damage, the pilot jumped out with a parachute from about 2,000 feet in the air and landed safely. The unmanned aircraft crashed into the field north of the Shanghai University sports field. According to a Shanghai University staff member who witnessed the incident, at around 11:00 AM, two Japanese army single-wing pursuit aircraft took off from the air base near the school and practiced tactics in the sky above the university sports field. After about half an hour, one of the aircraft was seen unable to move freely at a height of about 2,000 feet. One or two seconds later, the pilot jumped out from his seat, and the parachute opened, blown northward by a gentle breeze. At first, it seemed that it would fall into the river, but it was blown back by the wind and landed safely in the field. The aircraft suddenly tilted and seemed to be about to fall on the school's sports field. However, after descending several hundred feet, it suddenly veered to the right and crashed rapidly into the field, far from where the pilot landed. Immediately after landing, thick smoke and flames rose, and it is heard that it was burned down.</p>

<p>Old Traitors Dismissed</p>
<p>New Puppets Take the Stage</p>
<p>The "大美晚报" reports that the Chinese political organs under the control of the Japanese army in Zhabei reappeared today (16th) after they emerged on April 1 and were dissolved by order of the Japanese naval authorities on April 11. However, its leading figures are no longer the same people. Yesterday, the Preparatory Office of the Zhabei Citizens' Maintenance Association was first established at No. 211 Yucai Road near Linping Road. This morning, it officially moved to No. 66 Minli Road. The main personnel have not yet been announced. It is only heard that several famous Chinese figures in the Public Concession and the French Concession have been invited to assist in this effort. Most of the general employees are still people from the old Maintenance Association. They have now started working. However, the president and directors of the old Maintenance Association have not been able to resume their old jobs. Yesterday, another 54 police officers, 8 clerks, and 4 special investigators were sent to Wusong to organize a branch. However, most of the houses in Wusong today have been destroyed by the war, and the refugees who have returned to their hometowns only have grass fences to shelter them from the wind and rain. Although farmers are cultivating in the fields, many villages have been destroyed by artillery fire. It is still a long way to go to restore the old appearance. The police hired by the Zhabei Maintenance Association are all unarmed, wearing blue cloth uniforms. The investigators are all in plain clothes and are stationed at the entrances to the various roads, searching people's belongings. Last night, someone in a car distributed anti-China leaflets in the Pingliang Road area, persuading Chinese people to oppose the warlords' plans and to have citizens manage Shanghai themselves. This leaflet was printed by the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Citizens' Self-Strengthening Association.</p>

<p>Released After Four Hours of Negotiation</p>
<p>The "字林西报" reports that Mr. Ford, a British teacher at the Western Children's Public School, was detained by soldiers of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces for four hours yesterday (the 15th) because he released a Chinese man. The Chinese man was accused of robbing someone because he was carrying a short knife, and he was tied up. Ford was finally released at 8:20 PM. According to a report obtained by the patrol, Ford had ridden a motorcycle over the railway line and entered Zhabei from the back gate of Hongkou</p>

<p>Park. Then the above-mentioned incident occurred. It happened that at about 4:35 PM, a Western constable and a Chinese constable were patrolling the area on a motorcycle and caught sight of five or six Japanese soldiers surrounding a Westerner not far from the Jiangwan Road. They stopped their vehicle, and a Japanese soldier came forward, but they could not understand each other's language. The Japanese soldier then wrote the words "Need to summon Japanese soldiers," which were translated into English by the Chinese constable, and they understood his meaning. The Western constable and others stayed for a while, and then several more Japanese soldiers came forward, threatening them with bayonets and forcing them to leave quickly. Subsequently, the Dixwell Road Patrol Room was reported and dispatched Deputy Western Patrol Commander Miles Coffey and a Japanese patrolman. When they arrived, the Japanese soldiers were escorting the motorcycle, etc., to the Gendarmerie Headquarters. The situation was reported to the Dixwell Road Police District Director Cannete and Patrol Chief Uehara. Finally, the Deputy Western Patrol Commander was also ordered to leave the military department. Finally, Cannete personally handled the negotiation for Ford's release, but the Japanese authorities insisted on detaining Ford for further investigation. Finally, late yesterday, the Japanese Consulate General issued a statement stating that Ford had written a letter of apology and had been released. Furthermore, according to a statement from the Japanese military headquarters, the Chinese man was a robbery suspect who was arrested near 63 Garden and was carrying a short knife. The Westerner came to cut the rope that bound him, so he was detained.</p>

<p>Foreign Warships: The two U.S. destroyers, No. 222 and No. 217, the "尔满号" and "惠披尔号" respectively, which were previously ordered to go to Zhenjiang and Nanjing, were transferred back to Shanghai yesterday. The U.S. gunboat "芬煦号", which was heading to the Yangtze River, also returned to Shanghai yesterday and has entered port. The French gunboat "摩里号" has come to Shanghai from North China and has also entered port.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships: A Japanese 16th Destroyer Squadron ship, escorting the transport ship "春光丸轮," carrying a large amount of military steel plates, ammunition, food, and military medical supplies, has arrived in Shanghai and is being unloaded in Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships: The NYK Line has recently decided to reserve the cabins on ships such as the "笠置," "山城," "山形," "近江," and "八幡丸" exclusively for military use, and will not sell tickets to passengers, because many sick and injured officers and soldiers from the Shanghai-based army and navy have returned to their home country, and the Japanese side is also sending replacement troops to Shanghai from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="e18">National Crisis Relief Association Held General Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The National Crisis Relief Association held a general membership meeting at the Zhongshe on Weihaiwei Road yesterday at 2 PM. More than thirty people attended, and Zhang Yaozeng was elected as chairman. After the meeting began, Wen Qinfu first reported on the association's diplomatic stances, and Huang Renzhi reported on the proceedings of the National Crisis Conference. Then, various important cases were discussed and the following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the case of Japan instigating the puppet state of Manchuria to refuse Gu Weijun's entry into Manchuria, intending to conceal the truth of Japan's aggression, it was resolved to urgently telegraph Gu Jun, insisting that he must go regardless, and to telegraph the League of Nations, exposing Japan's conspiracy. (2) Regarding Ma Zhanshan's revolt and the association's need to commend Ma Zhanshan and urge him to vigorously resist Japan, it was resolved and passed. (3) Regarding the stance the association should take on the advocacy of the Civil Constitutionalism Advancement Association, it was resolved to send a telegram of support.</p>
<p>Supporting the Civil Constitutionalism Association: To be read by all newspaper publishers and the people of the nation. We recently read the telegram from members who did not attend the National Crisis Conference, listing specific proposals for national salvation, culminating in civil constitutionalism, and the initiation of the Civil Constitutionalism Advancement Association. This association has long believed that the country needs a fundamental law to bring order to the people, and that a constitution not created by the people cannot be considered impartial or trustworthy. We have previously listed five points: (1) Announce the abolition of one-party rule, (2) Abolish the use of "currently ruling" in official documents, (3) Prohibit party branches at all levels from interfering with people's gatherings and associations, (4) Prohibit the use of public funds for party expenses, (5) Convene a national representative assembly to draft a constitution within a time limit. We announced this to the nation via telegram on February 14th. Currently, the national crisis is severe. To resolutely resist Japan and overcome a strong enemy, it is essential to establish a grand plan for national cooperation to achieve the great effect of national unity against the enemy. The telegram's contents align with our previous proposals. After hearing this, we unanimously support it. We specifically telegraph our support for this proposal and hope that people across the country will rise up together to promote the early completion of the people's constitution, so that people's lives may have a foundation to rely upon. This is deeply fortunate. respectfully, National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Telegram Encouraging Ma Zhanshan: To Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heihe. We have received your two excellent telegrams. Your awe of righteousness and clear understanding of right and wrong, along with your lonely devotion, have deeply moved us. In the past, there were widespread rumors of your affiliation with the puppet state, which saddened those who heard of it. Now that the facts are clear and your intentions are revealed, the survival of the Northeast is tied to the nation's lifeline. We sincerely hope that you will see through your initial sorrow and restore our territory. The people of the whole country vow to be your support. We look forward to your banners from afar and await news of your victory. respectfully, National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Joint Association of Various People's Organizations Hosts Representatives from Beiping <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Association of Various People's Organizations hosted a banquet at the Dongya Restaurant yesterday for representatives from Beiping, including Ling Changyan. More than ten people attended, including Wang Zhisheng, Zhang Juansheng, Wang Baozhen, Yan Jin, Li Qiaozhi, and Shen Zurui. Wang Baozhen delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Mr. Ling's southward journey represents the people of the north. We respectfully express our utmost sincerity and welcome. The people of Shanghai have recently gained a new understanding. In the future, we should expand the anti-Japanese movement, concentrate the strength of the people, and do practical work to save the country. During the Shanghai Battle, the 19th Route Army automatically resisted, and the people provided assistance in terms of material and strength. The bloody battle lasted for more than a month, and this achievement is the result of military-civilian cooperation. It has become an indelible fact. Recently, diplomacy has repeatedly been humiliating. To save the country from danger, our people should automatically take on the responsibility of saving the country. We will resolutely oppose those who obstruct us, and we will overthrow with all our strength those who are willing to sell out the country." Ling Changyan then expressed several points of view: (1) Expand the organization of the people, with Shanghai, Beiping, and Guangzhou as the foundation for a national organization, so that the people of the whole country can unite and concentrate. (2) Adopt national economic policies. Politics must have economics as its background. We believe in the Three Principles of the People, but we must choose its priorities and adapt to the trend, in order to move towards the path of socialism. (3) Promote local autonomy, develop popular education, and increase popular political awareness. In short, national salvation groups must be divided into two types: those that address the symptoms and those that address the root causes. The way to address the symptoms is to mobilize the masses, expand the organization, and fight together. The way to address the root causes is to adopt national economic policies from above and adopt local autonomy proposals from below. Finally, Zhang, Wang, Yan, Shen, and others all put forward their opinions, opposing compromise diplomacy and relying on the League of Nations, and hoping that the whole country would unite in their demands and fight together. The meeting ended with excitement at 3 PM.</p>

<p>Deng Xihou and Liu Cunhou's reply to Zeng Qi</p>
<p>To Mr. Mu Han,</p>
<p>Your radiant letter, forwarded by Lianju, has been received, and we are deeply moved by your intention to supervise and teach us to send troops to resist Japan. Since the Japanese invaders invaded Liaoning and then probed at Shanghai, Hou has repeatedly telegraphed to express his determination to fight the enemy desperately and save the country from danger together. Upon receiving the order from Shanbing, I have again exhorted my troops and prepared for departure. I have long been determined to perish together and am even more eager to take up righteousness. However, the central government will have the General Staff Department formulate and order the route of troop deployment, which cannot be easily moved independently. Your intention to set out in different routes will be presented to the central government for adoption, and perhaps it will be approved to go north. In short, whether going north or east, the Sichuan army cannot remain stagnant and stick to the bottom of the well at this time. Our conscience is not dead, and we swear not to engage in empty talk. It will not be long before we shoulder our spears and advance. We hope you will understand this and encourage us. We are fortunate, Deng Xihou, respectfully.</p>
<p>To brother Wu Lianju of Beiping, to be forwarded to brother Zeng Muhan,</p>
<p>The reverent telegram forwarded by Lianju is imbued with great righteousness, which we cannot help but feel moved by. Hou's love for the country will not lag behind others. Since the violent sun invaded Liaoning and Shanghai, I have repeatedly telegraphed to volunteer and have been waiting for orders with my spears as pillows, to curb this fierce aura. In recent days, Jiang and Wang have also discussed plans for the Sichuan army to select 50,000 elite soldiers and send them to Henan and Hubei. Once the route is determined, we will follow your instructions to unite with comrades in Sichuan in various units and go to Henan via Shaanxi. We still ask you to give us advice from time to time, so that we may follow it. We pray, Your brother, Liu Cunhou, respectfully.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the volunteer army of the flower and yarn industry in this city has been stationed in Pudong and has been responsible for the Shanghai supply station of the 19th Route Army, transporting goods, with remarkable achievements. Recently, with the approval of the General Headquarters Staff Office of the army, they were transferred to the Kunshan Transportation Office to serve, led by squad leader Lu Junlin. The director, Tang Dehuang, issued firearms and symbols and ordered them to manage important matters such as ships, vehicles, and telegrams in places such as Su and Kun. It is reported that the army has recently been busy with work and has ordered rear team members to depart in batches.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sends Representatives to the Capital to Petition for the New Sugar Tax <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>White Sugar Currently Valued at Six Taels Must Be Taxed at Eight Taels</p>
<p>How Can the Daily Necessities of Ordinary People Bear Such a Heavy Burden?</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, due to orders from the Ministry of Finance, has revised the tax rate on sugar from April 1st, calculating an increase of more than double the old tax rate. It is found that each bag of white sugar is currently worth no more than six taels but must pay more than eight taels in customs duties. The tax is as high as 30% of the value of the goods. No other imported goods are subject to such a heavy tax. Sugar merchants believe that sugar is a daily necessity for ordinary people. In this autumn of declining people's strength, it is impossible to suddenly increase the heavy burden. They have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting reduction, exemption, and postponement, but have not been approved. The association previously determined that the sugar goods in February and March would not be less than hundreds of thousands of bags. Previously, in accordance with the notice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the shipment of goods ordered from various countries was delayed, and it has not yet been shipped to Shanghai. If the new tax is implemented, the losses will be even more severe. They have sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, hoping that it will fulfill its responsibilities and send a committee to the capital to plead for the sugar merchants. It is now known that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appointed Standing Committee member Wang Yansong at yesterday's regular meeting to go to the capital with sugar industry representatives to plead their case.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Recent News on the Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Li Guojie has been working on the reorganization. The recent news he has obtained is distributed as follows:</p>
<p>Staff Reduction: Before the company was taken over by the National Government, the number of staff members in the entire company was limited, and the salaries were relatively low. The total monthly salary of the general office staff was only over 9,000 taels. Later, after several commissioners expanded the scale of the company, the monthly salary expenditure has reached over 30,000 taels. After Li Guojie took over, he immediately started from the aspect of tightening up, first canceling the general management office, and recently reducing the staff of various sections and departments. In recent days, more than 50 people from various sections and departments have been announced to be laid off. The salary item can save more than 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Supervision: Supervisor Chen Fumu will come to Shanghai to take up his post, and his office is located on the third floor of the company. The original radio station, etc., on the third floor has been moved to the No. 7 dormitory. During the relocation period, radio reception and transmission will be temporarily handled by the China Radio Engineering Society Radio Station and the Xinjiang Tianlun Motor. The scale of the supervisor's office is quite large and is also divided into sections for management. A total of more than 40 staff members have been assigned.</p>
<p>Ships: There are already five Yangtze River ships sailing along the Yangtze River as traffic ferries. The Yuan'an ship, which was chartered to transport coal for passengers in the South Seas, was recovered by the shipowner for his own use in Hong Kong due to rental fees. Upon receiving the report, the company plans to send fairness to the South Seas to sail on its behalf.</p>
<p>Wharf: The company's Jinliyuan Wharf is the best of Shanghai's steamboat wharfs, with convenient unloading and a large area. However, the company has paid no attention to the wharf for many years. Due to long-term disrepair, the accumulated silt in each wharf has been increasing day by day. Recently, when the tide recedes, it is only eight feet deep, which makes it impossible for ships in the river and sea to sail regardless of their load when the tide recedes, which seriously hinders ship travel. The administrator has already submitted a request for dredging.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Statement from the First Special Court Regarding Criticisms from the MacKay <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Jurisdiction Belongs to Different Areas</p>
<p>Many Misunderstandings of the Facts</p>
<p>A letter from the Registry of the Shanghai First Special District Court states: On the 14th of this month, a newspaper reported on the criticism of the court by Mr. MacKay, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in his report to the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers. There were points of unclarity regarding the court's jurisdiction, and the facts of the events cited were not entirely accurate. Fearing that the outside world would misunderstand, a special statement is made. The question of whether to ban people's patriotic movements falls within the scope of administrative authority and cannot be preempted by the court. MacKay's claim that the court protects the anti-Japanese movement fails to understand the court's position. Moreover, according to our country's laws, the court's principle of judging cases is to not prosecute without a complaint. Since September 18th, the Municipal Council has only filed three cases with the court regarding the anti-movement, all of which have been judged impartially by the court in accordance with the law. Although the theory of evidence collection and the weight of the cases differ, and opinions vary, the independence of the judiciary allows for appeals as a means of redress and cannot be hastily judged as intentional favoritism based on subjective prejudices. There have been no other prosecutions or private prosecutions related to anti-Japanese incidents in the court. Whether there is any truth to the so-called forced seizure of 600,000 yuan worth of Chinese goods in MacKay's report, which were then sold and disposed of without authorization, and the illegal arrest and detention of several Chinese merchants, the court has no way of knowing. A statement must be made in this regard. In terms of responsibility, the authority of the special district prosecutor is limited to cases under Articles 103 to 186 of the Criminal Code, according to the agreement. Regarding the circumstances of the forced seizure of goods mentioned in MacKay's report, even if true, the special district prosecutor is not responsible for prosecution. Now, MacKay blames the court for not hearing or inquiring, which shows that he does not fully understand the court's jurisdiction. The other parts of MacKay's report, such as the failure of the court to enforce the law when the boycott of Japanese goods began, and the court's attitude being one of the causes of the Sino-Japanese Zhabei War, are even more misunderstandings. Furthermore, the number of civil cases accepted by our court has greatly increased compared to the era of the Provisional Court, and the handling procedures are more detailed. Since Dean Zhou took office, he has begun to actively reorganize, and there has been a visible improvement. MacKay's report does not mention any specific facts of dissatisfaction, and our court has no way of answering them. As it concerns the credibility of the judiciary, we respectfully request that your editor examine this and publish it in the newspaper to clarify the truth. This is our sincere prayer.</p>

<p>Suzhou Creek (i.e., Wusong River) is the only waterway for inland and Shanghai water transportation. The Shanghai Local Maintenance Association has repeatedly telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting them to order the river's land and water police teams to be responsible for maintaining order. Yesterday, Xu Pucheng, the district chief of the first district of the Provincial Water Police Team, received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Civil Affairs Department, ordering him to allocate police teams and boats to be stationed along the river in sections. District Chief Xu immediately ordered Luo Daokun, the team leader of the third team, and Zhou Xingbei, the team leader of the fifth team, to select officers to patrol and protect the river in sections.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Two Major Medical Associations Merge <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>To Be Named the Chinese Medical Association</p>
<p>At 7 PM yesterday, the executive committees of the Chinese Medical Association and the Bo Medical Association held a joint meeting on the fifth floor of the Bank Club at No. 4 Hong Kong Road to pass a motion to merge the two associations. All executive committee members of the two associations attended, and Dr. Yan Fuqing was elected as the temporary chairman. Maxwell, a representative of the Bo Medical Association, first reported that the association used a postal voting method to solicit the public opinion of all members, and the results showed that those who supported the merger accounted for almost all of the members. Zhu Hengbi, a representative of the Chinese Medical Association, then reported that the association handled it in the same way, and the results showed that 98% of the members supported it. After listening to the reports, the executive committees of the two associations agreed to merge and named it the Chinese Medical Association. All the members of the two associations resigned, and Zhu Hengbi nominated, with the approval of Maxwell, and elected the list of new association officers as follows: Chairman Niu Huisheng, Vice Chairmen H. H. Merris and Hu Huide, Secretary-General Zhu Hengbi, Accountant Zhu Jiacheng, Editor Lin Zongyang, and James L. Maxwell, Committee Members J. L. H. Paterson, Le Wenzhao, Frances King, and Xiao Zhigao. All members passed. The new association's articles of association will be passed by the general assembly to show prudence. The Bo Medical Association was established in 1887 and was founded by European and American physicians traveling to China. It held a conference once in the second year. Its publications were the Bo Medical Association Bulletin, and the editorial department reprinted various medical books, which were adopted by many medical schools. It has reached thousands of members. The Chinese Medical Association was established in the third year of the Republic of China and was founded by Chinese physicians. It also has nearly a thousand members. Its publications are the Chinese Medical Journal, all of which are works carefully researched by the members. There are many original works, and they have a very deep understanding of medical essence. The merger of the two associations has broken the international boundaries of the academic community, and the future is bright. It is a righteous undertaking.</p>
<h3 id="e29">The Great Alliance for Promoting National Products Sends Letters to Various Cities and Counties <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Designing to Expand Publicity</p>
<p>Promoting Production to Save the Country</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association sent letters to national product organizations in famous provinces, cities, and counties across the country, asking them to design and expand publicity efforts, actively awaken the people to promote national products, implement production to save the country, and resist for a long time, sharing the national crisis and protecting national products. The original letter stated: (omitted above) Promoting national products is the only shortcut to saving the country through production. Our association has been working hard to promote national products for 12 years, and the psychology of saving the people to use national products has gradually achieved results. As Shanghai is the center of manufacturing national products, it cannot be slightly neglected to run and appeal. It has been severely harmed by the violent Japanese invasion of Shanghai. National product factories are under the power of guns, cannons, and bombs and have been almost completely destroyed. We painfully observe the current situation, which cannot be restored in a short time. It is a major catastrophe in the process of promoting national products. However, continued efforts will eventually lead to success. However, at this time of attack, the productivity of national product factories is weak, and Japanese goods that harm national products will take advantage of the opportunity to rise and dominate sales. Considering that the people have a weak will and are easily tempted, the outflow of rights and interests will be used to build weapons, which will prepare for invading China and harming our people. The lessons of the past are not far away. How can we not be deeply grieved? The 16th regular meeting of our association's 12th session resolved to hand over the design of publicity to the publicity department, actively awaken the citizens to promote national products, and send letters to national product organizations in various provinces, cities, and counties to step up the publicity of national products, assist in the process, and record it on file. In addition to the design, we are sending a letter to your association in response to the enthusiasm for promoting national products and the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, taking advantage of the deep and serious impression of this national crisis to actively discuss and expand publicity efforts, awaken the people to promote national products, save the national crisis together, and maintain national products. We hope you will investigate and handle this, and we hope to see your reply for guidance.</p>

<p>The National Lawyers Association of the Republic of China previously convened a temporary executive committee in Shanghai and invited lawyers' associations from various provinces to send representatives to Shanghai to meet at the Shanghai Lawyers' Association to discuss matters that should be promoted and reformed in the judiciary. Twelve meetings were held, and a special committee was organized to study the criminal law and criminal procedure codes. The committee elected members of each group and modified, studied, and discussed various important motions on file. However, at that time, violent Japanese troops invaded the country, and the members of each group did not complete the discussion of each case. Now, committee members Fei Tinghuang and Zhang Shituan have drafted reports on the cases submitted to them for research and sent them to representatives of various associations. On the one hand, they have submitted the most important cases to the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration for review and handling.</p>

<p>Advocating Using Art to Contribute to the World</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Shuren arrived in Shanghai from Hankou the day before yesterday by a Great China Company steamer and is staying at Wang Jingwei's residence. Yesterday (the 15th) at noon, he, accompanied by He Xiangning and Liu Yazi, drove to Avenue Dubail to visit his party friend Liu Haisu. In recent years, Mr. Chen's interest in politics has waned, while his progress in art and learning has been rapid. Yesterday, he had a long conversation with Liu Haisu, advocating using art and learning to contribute to the new world. He will pay attention to international art promotion in the future. In 1934, China and Germany will jointly hold a Chinese art exhibition in Berlin.

<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the General Manager of the Public Concession Bureau yesterday, stating that according to a letter from Xu Zhongjian, his residence is located on North Shanxi Road, north of Hongkou Haining Road, which is the front line of defense. The sandbags are full, and the residents have already moved away. Now it is slightly quiet, and he moved back on April 1. The donation collectors followed immediately, their momentum fierce. It happened that I was away on business, and the women were ignorant. Seeing the Westerners threatening and employing force, they were at a loss, running around crying, and almost getting sick, etc. It is noted that the association has already written to your bureau requesting to suspend the collection of donations. According to the previous letter, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and order the donation collectors to suspend the collection to show compassion.</p>

<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation recently received a letter from Fang Xili, a merchant from Wangjiaxi, Dutch East Indies, stating that his daughter Yan Yu, before leaving, entrusted her classmate to exchange the national currency she had saved for Dutch currency to bring back. There were thirty Dutch guilders (exchanged at a small money shop on Sichuan Road when departing). When they arrived at the pier, they immediately handed it over to their brother. After the brother inspected it, there were many newly made ones. However, recently, many counterfeit goods have been found in Xijiang. For the sake of prudence, the brother asked the police chief to check it on their behalf to prevent accidents. As a result, eight out of ten were counterfeit. Fortunately, they reported it themselves, avoiding lawsuits, otherwise they would have been wrongfully imprisoned. It is heard that entry into the country is prohibited. I sincerely hope that this news will be reported in the newspapers so that our overseas Chinese students will be cautious when they want to return to the Dutch East Indies. Being deceived when exchanging Dutch currency is a minor matter, but violating local laws is a major crime.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Anti-Opium Association Asks for Prosecution of the Chief Culprit of the Fujian Public Opium Sales <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Association believes that Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of Fujian Province, colluded with the garrison to implement public opium sales. Although opposed by all parties, it was forced to cancel. However, Fang's crime of violating laws and harming the party and the country is unforgivable. Yesterday, it specially sent a letter to the Executive Yuan, requesting strict legal action to rectify official discipline. The original letter is recorded as follows: (Dear Sir, the opium public sales in Fujian Province, although temporarily canceled due to the resolute opposition of this association and various mass organizations, the rumors of a secret movement to revive it are rampant. Moreover, Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of Fujian Province, the chief culprit who advocated the opium public sales, has not been punished by the central government according to law, which is not enough to appease the public's anger and rectify officialdom. It is found that Mr. Fang has a habit of addiction to opium and has committed numerous evils. The people of Fujian Province hate him to the bone. This time, he brazenly disregarded everything and promoted opium public sales, illegally established a prohibited goods inspection office, appointed relatives, namely, Lin Zhong, as the director-general, widely distributed henchmen, and appointed opium officials to enrich themselves and harm the people, poisoning the country. Although the plan failed soon, his violation of the prohibition law, disregard for the law, deliberation, and willingness to engage in unscrupulous acts are unforgivable. If he is allowed to escape the net and is not severely punished, then in the year of profit, everyone will rush to it, and in the year of leniency, everyone will be bold. It is difficult to guarantee that officials in various provinces will not follow suit. This association has received numerous letters and telegrams from Fujian Province and various associations of Fujian natives in Shanghai, protesting and requesting this association to request the authorities to severely punish the culprits in this case. Therefore, based on public opinion, we request legal action. We implore Your Excellency to rectify the officialdom, maintain the rule of law, quickly remove Mr. Fang from all his concurrent positions, and punish him severely to warn against imitation and ban opium, which will be a virtuous act. Sincerely, Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government,)</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Times, in recent years, there have been quite a few people around the world discussing the use of films to subsidize education, and even conservative teachers have had to admit the benefits of this matter. The League of Nations has endorsed this new method of education, so it has organized the International Film Education Association and established a Chinese Committee in Shanghai. The association held its second meeting on Thursday. According to Mr. Boss, the honorary representative in China, this move has received the sympathetic cooperation of the Nanjing Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government. For example, Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health, and Xu Peihuang, Director of the Education Bureau, have joined the association and are working hard. Subsequently, the members discussed what kind of educational films are most suitable for Chinese schools, and discussed raising funds to purchase films, or collecting various films and disseminating them to schools in the city. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession also sent Foster Cump, the supervisor of the Education Department, and the French Concession Board sent Grosbois, the principal of the French Public School, as representatives to attend the meeting. Because the association currently has insufficient members to actively promote this movement, it decided to recruit 20 correspondents from various provinces to be responsible for publicity work. Because Boss will return to China in the next few days, Foster Cump was elected as the chairman of the Chinese Committee.</p>

<p>Public Works Department Responds to Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department on April 4, expressing its views on the issue of cracking down on unlicensed vendors. The Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Department replied to the association yesterday, saying that recently, due to the current situation, there are many refugees in the concession, and the power of the patrol is difficult to be thorough in cracking down on unlicensed vendors, and the number of these vendors is increasing day by day. As normalcy gradually returns, satisfactory measures have been taken for the problem of obstacles on the roadside and the problem of unfair competition between unlicensed vendors and shops and markets. The shops have complained to the Bureau about the disturbances of the vendors, and the obstruction of traffic has also been repeatedly discovered. Therefore, for the sake of safety and order, we have to seek to improve this situation, and the original letter from the joint chambers of commerce of each road also mentioned this matter.</p>

<p>Lawyer Ren Zhennan, in the case where Yongshang Zhuang Chunfu accused Xu Qiyang of defrauding more than 5,000 yuan in the case of Wang Lianxiang suing for bigamy, was sentenced to four months of imprisonment and compensation for Zhuang's private prosecution in the first instance by the local court. Ren refused to accept the judgment and appealed again. Yesterday morning, the original court held a hearing. Zhuang Li, Zhuang Chunfu's wife, testified that Zhuang Chunfu was sued by Wang Lianxiang for bigamy, and Ren Zhennan was hired with a defense fee of 200 taels, which was introduced by Qian Yumin and Liu Gongda. Later, because Ren said that he could reconcile with the other party's lawyer, a handling fee of 500 taels was paid to the other party at the China Hotel, which was equivalent to 696 yuan in foreign currency. At that time, there were Qian Yumin and my husband. The next day, another 1,000 yuan was paid. The third time, 3,000 yuan in foreign currency was paid in Ren's office, all of which were banknotes and a 500 tael check from the Shanghai Bank. I took out the 3,000 yuan from the cloak and personally handed it to Ren Zhennan. The 500 tael check was borrowed from Qian Yumin. Qian Yumin came to court after the first trial, but has not been seen since, and I don't know where he has gone, etc. Zhuang Chunfu also testified the same as before. Ren Zhennan was questioned and testified that Qian Yumin had not been to the original trial several times, and only came after I was detained. I want to completely deny the plaintiff's accusation of fraud. The official said that Qian Yumin and Gu Gongda must be summoned before the matter can be thoroughly understood. Ren said that if Qian Yumin never arrives, the appellant will always be detained. The original trial did not investigate the evidence. The official said that the appeal trial will of course definitely re-investigate, and the court does not know how to summon Qian Yumin for a while, but in this case, you should withdraw the appeal, otherwise the loss will be even greater. Ren Zhennan was unwilling, and the official ordered him to be detained and wait for a way to summon the witnesses for a retrial.</p>

<p>The Crime of Premeditated Murder Attempted Is Established</p>
<p>Ge Chengrong and Dong Shaoqing are each Imprisoned for Eight Years</p>
<p>Ge Chengrong, a 50-year-old man from Yangzhou, lives at No. 43, Sanyuanfang, Yangshupu. Five years ago, he was a foreman of the Longda Steamer at Datong Wharf. Later, due to discord with his wife Ge Chen, he remarried Ge Zhao as a concubine, separated from the big wife, and let Ge Chen replace him as the foreman of the steamer. She rented a room on the upper floor of the pavilion at No. 57 Hongshanli, Xinzha Road. Later, Ge and Shi had a lawsuit and had already separated their relationship as husband and wife in writing. Recently, Ge had no decent occupation and was in extreme economic difficulty. On February 28 this year, he met his friend Dong Shaoqing at Chunyuan Teahouse on Xinqiao Street. Ge recruited Cui, Wu Xiaodaizi, and the two of them to discuss how to kill Ge Chen. As a result, they decided to use violence. On the morning of March 2, they went to Shi's house at 6 AM. Lao Cui was downstairs, and Ge, Lu, and Wu went upstairs, tightly pinching Shi's neck and throat, and Shi fainted. Ge and others saw that their goal had been achieved and thought she was dead, so they fled one after another. Later, Shi's maid Zhang Shen noticed it and tried to wake her up.

<p>Jiang Jinrong's 19-year-old daughter Jindidi, a native of Yangzhou living at No. 418 Roberts Road, suddenly disappeared on the 9th of this month. People were entrusted to look for her without success. On the 11th, a letter was received from the daughter, saying that she had voluntarily married and hoped that her parents would not worry. The father was horrified because Jindidi had already been betrothed to her cousin Zhou Hongfu, who was also from the same hometown, and they were about to get married immediately. Therefore, he was extremely anxious. The day before yesterday, he received another letter, knowing that his daughter was cohabiting with Chen Wenkui, a native of Anhui, 27 years old, at No. 148 Tangshan Road. Therefore, he reported the information to Huishan Police Station, which sent agent Zhao Ruisheng to arrest Chen and bring the girl Jindidi to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to Gao Yiting of the First Special District Court. According to the police lawyer Qian Xunxun, the two letters were presented for inspection and trial. The plaintiff Jiang Jinrong claimed that his daughter Jindidi was 19 years old this year and was a female worker in the Dongyang Yarn Factory. The defendant gave his daughter four rice tickets and whispered intimately before leaving. I knew they were having an affair and forbade my daughter from going out. Unexpectedly, two days later, the defendant came to tease my daughter again and was scolded by his wife before he escaped. Jindidi was betrothed to the Zhou family when she was three years old and had received a betrothal gift. She was supposed to marry him this fall. He asked the court to punish the defendant. Jiang Zhou also claimed that Jindidi was his daughter, 19 years old, a Tiger. She briefly reported the course of events. The girl Jindidi claimed that she was 21 years old, a Rat, and had known the defendant for about a year. She now wants to marry the defendant and claimed that she had not been betrothed to her cousin Zhou, etc. The defendant was questioned and claimed that he had known the girl for seven months, introduced by a friend named Wang. He had a relationship with the girl in the past three months. That day, the girl came to his house and refused to go back. So, he asked his friend to write a letter to notify her mother to agree. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Judge Qiao sentenced Chen Wenkui to six months of imprisonment to warn him, and the girl Jindidi was taken back by her parents.</p>

They discovered a few days ago that a Ningbo native, Lu Chengxiang, had been secretly manufacturing morphine, a poisonous drug, at his residence at No. 31 Fengbo Lane, Wusong River Road, to supply the now-popular production of "red pills" (a type of drug), making considerable profits, in violation of the prohibition. They immediately reported to the Western Detective Chief, who, along with Western and Chinese detectives, quietly went to arrest him around 9 PM that night. Lu was at home and was arrested on the spot. Over 100 pounds of manufactured morphine (packaged in bottles) and manufacturing equipment were seized and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Special District Local Court for investigation. At 3 PM, Judge Li Changnian, along with clerk Wu Shan, and prosecutor Wu Xiaoke, came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. First, the police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, stated the case, saying that the police were temporarily prosecuting the defendant under Article 6 of the Opium Prohibition Law, because the police had discovered the defendant was secretly manufacturing morphine, went to arrest him, and seized a large amount of manufactured morphine cakes. As the case is serious, a thorough investigation is required, and he requested the court to postpone the hearing for further questioning. When questioned, the defendant Lu Chengxiang claimed to be in the rice business (Note: the defendant owns the Xiangfengshun Rice Shop, behind the Great World). He gave vague answers regarding the morphine matter and hired a lawyer to defend him, requesting permission for bail pending the adjourned hearing. The judge said that the case was serious and that the defendant would have to provide a cash bond of 10,000 yuan to be released on bail. After the defendant's lawyer requested a reduction, the court ordered the hearing to be adjourned to April 24, and the defendant was released on bail of 6,000 yuan in cash; without bail, he would be returned to custody.</p>

<p>Carried in a Truck</p>
<p>Discovered by Police Officer</p>
<p>Li Chen, a young woman from Funing, of marriageable age, and not unattractive, lost her husband in an accidental explosion of gunpowder while he was making firecrackers. Unable to settle down, she secretly came to Shanghai last winter and cohabitated with a man named Guo, living together as if they were husband and wife. When her in-laws heard about this, they sent her cousin, Li Youcai, to Shanghai to find out her address. He went to her residence the other day and tried to persuade her to return home, but she was so infatuated with her lover that she refused. Li Youcai had no choice but to hire someone to tie her hands and feet with rope, stuff her mouth with cotton to prevent her from making noise, and hire a truck to hide her in the vehicle. As they sped near Dapu Bridge outside Ximen, an officer from the Second District noticed the truck's suspicious behavior and ordered it to stop for inspection. They discovered the bound woman, removed the cotton from her mouth, and she immediately cried for help. The group of people, along with the truck, were taken to the Second District Headquarters. After interrogation, they were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I am writing to inform you that the report in your newspaper yesterday regarding a Japanese ship masquerading as a Chinese ship to seize inland navigation rights contains many inaccuracies. I have not accepted any employment from the company mentioned. I met Mr. Li of that company while the ship I was serving on was passing through Dalian. We discussed hiring a Chinese captain, but the proposed terms of employment were not suitable, and the matter was dropped. I have no connection with the company and have never been in contact with them. I ask for a correction to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Jin Bingtang, April 16th.</p>

The Chinese representatives, including Gu Weijun, will travel to the north via the South Manchurian Railway from Dalian. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Inquiry Commission's route to the east, the Japanese side still insists that they will not be responsible for safety unless it goes via the South Manchurian Railway. The Inquiry Commission believes that traveling via the South Manchurian Railway would require a detour and make it inconvenient to collect materials along the railway. They still prefer the Beining Railway and are actively consulting with the Japanese representatives. The Inquiry Commission previously telegraphed the League of Nations in Geneva to inquire about the departure. The reply has arrived, instructing them to proceed at their discretion. The representatives held two meetings at the Beijing Hotel today, morning and afternoon, to discuss the itinerary and route to the east. A tentative departure has been set, and all staff have been notified to prepare for the journey. (16th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Lytton and four members went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a few days ago to review the files to prove whether the so-called "parallel railway line" secret agreement existed. Our side had already presented the original text of the "New Three Eastern Provinces Treaty" and the minutes of the meeting in Nanjing. There was no other secret agreement. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that there was indeed a Nanjing Agreement and sent a copy to the Inquiry Commission as proof. After verification a few days ago, it was discovered that the secret agreement the Japanese were referring to was the minutes of the meeting. The minutes of the meeting are not a treaty, let alone a secret agreement. Thus, the basis on which Japan has been arguing for months on the issue of parallel railway lines has completely disappeared. (16th dispatch)</p>

They will advance along the Mayi River to meet the Self-Defense Army in Yimianpo Maoer Mountain, and their momentum is growing. The Japanese Murai Brigade moved to Acheng on the 16th morning.

<p>(Harbin) The situation in northern Manchuria is becoming increasingly complex. The Self-Defense Army, not the Manchurian state army, is definitely in control of the overall situation. Government troops stationed in various small towns have joined the Self-Defense Army one after another, and in several places, upon hearing that the Self-Defense Army is about to attack, they flee and surrender to the other side. The Manchurian state army has now acquired a new name, "Baomingjun" (Life-Preserving Army), meaning that they can do everything but fight for the (new) country. After Ma Zhanshan's defection, the momentum of the Self-Defense Army greatly increased. Ma recently went to Qiqihar to pack up his furniture and dismiss his servants. He left the city on April 4 with four carts full of household goods, initially stopping in Baiquan, where he was warmly welcomed by the local Self-Defense Army. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>

The bandits opened fire to force the train to stop, causing the train service to be suspended for ten hours.

<p>Harbin Police Chief Refuses</p>
<p>(Moscow) A telegram has been received here from Blagoveshchensk, reporting that the Japanese army in Harbin is actively attempting to provoke a serious dispute between the Soviet Union and the Manchurian government. It is said that these Japanese troops are firmly demanding that the Chinese authorities in Harbin inspect the Soviet consulate in that city. The reason for the demand for inspection is the false accusation that the Soviet Consul General is planning terrorist acts to sabotage the Chinese Eastern Railway. Although it is clear that the bridge bombing incident was orchestrated by White Russians, a reliable source reports that the Japanese military in Harbin held a meeting on the 12th of this month and decided to demand that the Chinese police in that city carry out this plan to inspect the Soviet consulate. The mastermind behind this is a Japanese advisor to the Harbin Chinese Police Department. However, despite the urging of the Japanese advisor, the head of the Harbin Police Department, Wang Qihua, refused, saying that he had not received direct orders from the Manchurian government in Changchun. The real reason for his refusal is that the Japanese advisor insisted that the action appear to be carried out independently and voluntarily by the Chinese police. It is said that when the Japanese advisor asked Chief Wang to carry out the inspection, he stated that this matter must absolutely not be known to the outside world as being directed by the Japanese army.

<h3 id="e81">Soviet Communiqué Comments on Japanese Provocative Behavior <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Containing a Special Political Effect</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's newspaper, Izvestia, today published a long editorial entitled "Continuous New Provocations in Manchuria." It stated that recent incidents in the area under the jurisdiction of the new government in Manchuria are quite noteworthy and suspicious. Suspected Russian conspiracy cases have been discovered one after another, and they seem to be directly linked to the actions of the Manchurian police and to the counter-propaganda of Japanese and White Russian newspapers. The provocative act of bombing the Songhua River Bridge occurred just as the famous White Russian leader Semenov was openly negotiating with powerful figures in Tokyo. After this negotiation, Japanese and Manchurian newspapers uniformly began a new attack on the Soviet Union. The methods of the Japanese newspapers are quite bizarre. They want to link the White Russian bridge bombing case on the Songhua River with the Harbin military vehicle accident and the unfounded rumors that Ma Zhanshan fled to Hailanpao, using them as an excuse to demand that the Japanese authorities in Manchuria take resolute action against a certain country. Japanese journalists shamelessly imitate the tone of politicians, vaguely saying that a certain country has recently planned to launch red terrorist sabotage activities. (The country they are referring to is obviously the Soviet Union). It is clear that their intention is to provoke a dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union. The Japanese newspaper in Harbin even stated that the Eastern Branch of the Communist International is related to Zhang Xueliang and the Kuomintang. The only deficiency is that the newspaper did not say that Gandhi and Hitler were both involved in the conspiracy to bomb the Songhua River Bridge. In short, those who can see clearly can understand this reversal of right and wrong. Their true intentions are even more evident in the recent rumors about Ma Zhanshan. We all know that at the beginning of the Manchurian Incident, the Japanese falsely accused General Ma of having relations with the Soviet Union and of receiving Soviet aid. Then a document was discovered, revealing that the Japanese themselves were transporting military supplies to General Ma. After that, General Ma settled matters peacefully with the Japanese and became an important official in the new Manchurian state. Now, the Japanese are again claiming that he has a relationship with the Soviet Union. However, today's statement issued by TASS has fundamentally refuted this rumor. Ma's speculative actions this time were obviously directed by the Japanese in order for the Japanese to create rumors that he had a relationship with the Soviet Union. These rumors are just as unfounded as the earlier reports in Japanese newspapers about the relationship between Ding Chao, Li Du, and the Soviet Union, and about the Soviet Union sending terrorists to Harbin to destroy the White Russian registration office. According to Izvestia's speculation, this continuous provocative behavior contains a special political effect. It intends to show the state of unrest in Manchuria in order to create an excuse for increasing the Japanese army. Regarding this point, a Tokyo newspaper specially published a document from the French military, stating that the new government in Manchuria has shown itself to be unable to maintain order, and it is quite necessary for the Japanese army to increase its forces. Izvestia pointed out another reason for the Japanese newspapers' continuous provocation and rumor-mongering: the League of Nations Inquiry Commission is about to arrive in Manchuria. The Japanese warlords want to use this despicable method to show the guests from Geneva that the Japanese troops occupying Manchuria and the White Russian troops there are "guardians of civilization." Although those who plot provocation want to use the Manchurian incident to incite a war in the Far East, their goal may not be easily achieved. Since the incident occurred, the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to its policy of peace abroad and protection of the interests of all workers at home. The Soviet Union will expose these conspiracies as much as possible, but will not be provoked to escalate the situation. (15th TASS dispatch)</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan Urged Him to Stay and Returned His Resignation</p>
<p>Shen Jin Ding's Talk:</p>
<p>Regarding the South Manchurian Railway Parallel Line Issue</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan resigned from his positions as Minister of Justice and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Executive Yuan urged him to stay. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo resigned from all his concurrent posts. The State Council decided to return the original resignation. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 11 a.m. on the 16th, Shen Jin Ding, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, received reporters from the capital on behalf of Minister Luo and made the following statement: Minister Luo is attending a meeting of the Executive Yuan and asked me to receive you on his behalf. Now, I will talk to you about the recent diplomatic situation. (1) Regarding the issue of parallel lines of the South Manchurian Railway, the Reuters report of Minister Luo's last conversation differed greatly from what Minister Luo actually said. Now, I will briefly explain to you. The so-called parallel lines are recorded in the minutes of the meeting supplementary to the Sino-Japanese Conference on Matters Concerning the Three Eastern Provinces in 1905. The Japanese version, which they call a secret agreement, differs slightly from the original text of the minutes. The original text states: "For the purpose of maintaining the interests of the Eastern Provinces Railway, the Chinese government agrees not to build parallel main lines or branch lines that would damage the interests of the railway near the railway before the recovery of the railway." This statement is recorded in the minutes and not included in the treaty. It is only kept in the minutes, so it has no effect as a treaty. Even the minutes themselves only have the signatures of the Chinese and Japanese representatives attending the meeting and do not have a seal, so they are certainly different from a treaty. For many years, what Japan has regarded as a parallel line and opposed has been the Datong Line. The Datong Line is more than 100 miles away from the South Manchurian Railway. It is not near it and its direction is not completely parallel. Even knowledgeable Japanese people, such as Professor Yokota of Tokyo Imperial University, have commented that the Datong Line cannot be considered a parallel line of the South Manchurian Railway. If the Datong Line is said to be parallel to the South Manchurian Railway, then the Tokaido Line and the Chuo Line on Honshu, Japan, can also be considered parallel. This shows that justice resides in people's hearts and legal principles cannot be ignored. Furthermore, statistics prove that the South Manchurian Railway's profits have not decreased due to the opening of the Datong Line. The recent decrease in the South Manchurian Railway's profits is due to its own management, which is too bureaucratic, and the impact of high gold prices. The Japanese side cannot subjectively blame the Datong Line, saying that it has damaged the interests of the South Manchurian Railway. In addition, the Xi'an Line is also considered by the Japanese side to be parallel to the South Manchurian Railway. This line is not only not parallel to the South Manchurian Railway, but is also further away, so it certainly cannot damage the interests of the railway. Moreover, China is using its own funds to build railways in its own territory to promote the economic development of the Northeast. Why should foreigners interfere? Furthermore, the Northeast has vast lands. In addition to the South Manchurian Railway, several more railways can be built. How can foreigners subjectively and arbitrarily oppose the construction of one or two more lines? (2) Regarding the Shanghai Ceasefire Conference, the Shanghai Ceasefire Conference was held based on a resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly. Now, the conference is stalled because Japan is exceeding the scope of the discussion of the ceasefire conference. Although the ceasefire conference is now deadlocked, the subcommittee meetings continue to be held, which proves that our side has no intention of breaking up the ceasefire conference. Unexpectedly, recently, the Japanese representatives in the subcommittee meetings have again raised issues outside the scope, which ultimately led to the adjournment of the subcommittee meetings. Our side certainly cannot bear any responsibility. Now, we are only waiting for a fair explanation from the League of Nations Special Committee. As for the policy to be adopted by our government, it is currently under careful consideration. According to today's news, it is said that the Japanese government seems to have instructed its representatives not to participate in the League of Nations Special Committee. If this is true, it is tantamount to saying that Japan does not want to be a member of the League of Nations and may place itself in an isolated position internationally. This kind of statement is the same as the argument that the country wants to withdraw from the League of Nations. Now, I will comment on the argument that Japan is withdrawing from the League of Nations. Recently, many Japanese have advocated withdrawing from the League of Nations. I personally feel that there are doubts as to whether these people have a deep understanding of the League of Nations Covenant. The Covenant stipulates that two years' notice must be given before withdrawing from the League of Nations, and all due responsibilities must be fulfilled one by one. Moreover, this matter has a significant relationship to Japan itself. After the European War, Japan was entrusted by the League of Nations to govern Yap Island. If it withdraws from the League of Nations, it must return the island to the League of Nations. Would Japan be willing to abandon it so hastily? Therefore, the argument of withdrawing from the League of Nations is probably just a high-sounding statement. (3) Regarding the issue of the pseudo-organization in the Northeast refusing to allow Gu's representatives to enter Manchuria, it is heard that the Japanese side has expressed informally that if the investigation team inspects the South Manchurian Railway line, it should bear the responsibility of protection. Where the investigation team intends to go should be decided by the team itself and not be subject to restrictions from any party. As the Northeast is a part of China's territory, our government will send appropriate troops to accompany them and be responsible for protecting the entire investigation team. This is currently under careful consideration. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Guo Taiqi Reports on the Negotiations</p>
<p>It is Said That Concrete Measures Have Been Decided</p>
<p>Telegraph to Yan Huiqing to Instruct Him on Matters</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held meetings on both the morning and afternoon of the 16th, chaired by Wang Zhaoming, to discuss the issue of Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Guo Taiqi reported on the breakdown of the ceasefire conference and presented all his views. The discussion on future countermeasures was very detailed. However, due to strict confidentiality, the content of the meeting was not released. It is only heard that concrete measures have been decided. A telegram was immediately sent to Yan Huiqing to supplement his report to the League of Nations Special Committee and instruct him on matters. Countermeasures were also discussed regarding the issue of the pseudo-state refusing to allow Gu to accompany the investigation team out of the pass. The entire organization of the League of Nations investigation team cannot be slightly affected by the unreasonable opposition of the pseudo-state. The investigation team has made a strict statement. Our diplomatic authorities have protested against the Japanese initiative in this matter. The responsibility for future security issues will naturally be assigned. Moreover, because the Northeast is our country's territory, if necessary, we will use force to protect all members of the team out of the pass. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today's State Council meeting discussed the countermeasures to the Shanghai Ceasefire Conference, studied the six recent telegrams from Yan Huiqing, and Guo Taiqi presented the 13 negotiation sessions. As a result, the countermeasures will be determined after the results of the Geneva Special Committee's discussion are telegraphed. Regarding the issue of the Northeast refusing Gu, although the Japanese side has expressed that it does not oppose the investigation team's hope to replace Gu, this matter has no reason, because Gu's mission was given by the National Government. On this point, the central government has no room for consideration. The government will still adhere to the original policy without any change. Some people advocate telegraphing Lytton again, stating that Japan must be responsible for the security of Gu after he arrives in the Northeast, and the chairman of the investigation team should make a statement to Japan again.

<p>Tells the Press He Does Not Want to Discuss the Shanghai Situation</p>
<p>Close Talks with Tardieu in Paris</p>
<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald Will Meet Him Soon</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 16th The US Secretary of State Stimson arrived here today. According to his statement to the press, he came here as the US representative to the Disarmament Conference to seek concrete results to benefit world peace, which is the common hope. He also said that he did not want to discuss the Shanghai issue.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 15th The US Secretary of State Stimson has arrived in Paris and immediately went to visit the French President Doumergue. Then, he had lunch with the French Prime Minister Tardieu. After the meal, the US and French Prime Ministers discussed world issues, especially focusing on disarmament. In the afternoon, Stimson received news reporters and said that the disarmament plan presented by US Representative Gibson in Geneva was not the US disarmament plan.</p>
<p>At 9:50, Stimson took a train to Geneva. In February, US Representative Gibson proposed in Geneva to completely abolish submarines, poison gas, and germ warfare, protect civilians from aerial bombardment, specially restrict tanks and mobile heavy artillery, and limit military spending. He also advocated extending the Washington Treaty and the London Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 15th Tardieu hosted Stimson at the Foreign Ministry. After the banquet, he had another meeting with him and then received British Ambassador Lord Tyrell. At 4:30, Tardieu attended the State Council meeting and reported on the work of the Disarmament Conference. After the meeting, he received Stimson and US disarmament representative Davis and talked for an hour. Tardieu then received the press and briefly said that he was very happy to meet his old friends after 20 years. We will freely study various issues related to the two countries in a friendly spirit, and pay special attention to the issues discussed in Geneva.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th British Prime Minister MacDonald plans to go to Geneva from London on April 20, the day after the Chancellor of the Exchequer presents the budget in the House of Commons, to personally contact French Prime Minister Tardieu, US Secretary of State Stimson, and other important politicians from various countries on international events.

<p>The Navy Secretary claims:</p>
<p>American Fleet to Remain in the Pacific</p>
<p>Its Deployment to be Determined by the Evolving Situation</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 15th – U.S. Navy Secretary Adams stated today that the U.S. Scouting Fleet, after its maneuvers off Honolulu and the West Coast, will likely return to the Atlantic as originally planned. However, he added that its original orders are subject to change at any time. It is noted that yesterday, Navy Department personnel indicated that the department was considering extending the stay of the entire fleet in the Pacific due to the protracted nature of the Far East crisis. There were also indications that the Scouting Fleet had received orders for an indefinite deployment in the Pacific. Today's statement by the Navy Secretary, therefore, raises the question of whether the situation is serious and he is unwilling to reveal the truth, hence this deliberate obfuscation.</p>

<p>Reports of Exploding Poison Gas Bombs are Inaccurate</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 15th – The TASS news agency today published a strongly worded condemnation of Japanese actions in the Three Eastern Provinces, stating that Japanese soldiers in Harbin are implementing a provocation plan to create a serious conflict between Soviet Russia and the authorities of the Three Eastern Provinces. The Japanese military authorities in Harbin are urging the Chinese authorities to search the Russian Consulate in Harbin under the pretext of the Russian Consulate harboring acts of violence and sabotage against the Chinese Eastern Railway. In reality, these acts of violence are committed by White Russians and Chinese and Japanese individuals. It is reported that the Harbin police chief stated that he cannot comply with the Japanese request to search the Russian Consulate without direct orders from the Changchun government. It is also reported that the Japanese are instructing that any search of the Russian Consulate must be carried out entirely by Chinese police, and that it must not be announced that this action is being directed by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Reuters, Riga, 16th – Soviet Russian newspapers are expressing unease about reports of the discovery of a plot to bomb the Songhua River railway bridge. The Izvestia newspaper stated that such actions are intended to draw Soviet Russia into a military conflagration.

<p>Reuters, London, 15th – The National Liberal Party is deeply concerned about the evolving situation in the Far East and intends to find ways to strengthen the government's handling of the Far East situation at the National Liberal Party's annual conference in Clacton. Sir Herbert Samuel will deliver an important statement on the Far East conflict at the conference, stating that the Far East incident hinders the development of international justice and a peaceful order. The international order cannot tolerate a violent policy that conflicts with the League of Nations Charter, the Pact of Paris, and the Nine-Power Treaty. The British government should maintain and support the policies outlined in the League of Nations resolution of March 11 and not recognize the situation that has been created in the Three Eastern Provinces or elsewhere that is contrary to the Pact of Paris, the League of Nations Charter, and the Nine-Power Treaty. If the policy of protest continues to be ineffective, the National Liberal Party Conference is willing to support a unified or collective sanctions plan that is most conducive to establishing peace and justice with minimal damage and delay.</p>

<p>Advocating National Socialism</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th – The Japanese Social Democratic Party, formerly the most stable party in the Japanese people's movement, has now split. Dissenters will organize a new political party based on national socialism. This split demonstrates the trend of anti-capitalism in Japan and the distrust of party governments, as party governments prioritize party interests over national interests. The government's attempt to remove Uchida, the president of the South Manchurian Railway, due to party relations, has aggravated the political situation and drawn criticism from the army and navy. The army and navy are now gradually gaining the trust and respect of the people.</p>
<p>Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – The Social Democratic Party split yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the National Socialist faction of the expanded Central Committee was defeated. Secretary-General Akamatsu and other cadres, along with 38,000 members of the Japanese Farmers' Union, 4,000 members of the Comrades Association, and 5,000 members of the Socialist Youth League, have jointly prepared to establish a new party. The remaining Social Democratic faction will hold an emergency Central Executive Committee meeting this afternoon to discuss future policy. As a result, they have decided to establish a strong, legitimate, and unified proletarian political party.

<p>Wang Delin Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army</p>
<p>Harbin-Suifenhe Line Tense, Fierce Fighting in Yanbian</p>
<p>Ding and Li Supplement Military Strength, Plan Counteroffensive</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Since the 7th, the situation on the Harbin-Suifenhe line has become tense again. This is because the vanguard of the first route of the National Salvation Army, led by Liu Wankui, advanced to the Hengdaohezi station. The Zhu Lihan Regiment of the puppet Jilin army stationed at the station, equipped with machine guns and artillery, defected en masse and joined the National Salvation Army. Zhu's regiment only had three companies; two companies defected, and the remaining company was transported by freight train back to Yimianpo to join the Japanese army. On the morning of the 8th, the National Salvation Army gradually increased its forces and advanced towards the areas of Shitouhezi and Hailin station. The 26th Brigade of Xing Zhanqing, who had agreed to be incorporated by the puppet Jilin authorities, also conducted anti-Japanese activities after receiving their pay, moving diagonally to the left of the Wujimi River and threatening the rear of the Japanese army at Yimianpo. As a result, the Japanese army and the Xi Qia army were attacked from both sides. Xi's three brigades, in conjunction with the Japanese army's Amano and Hase units (one company each), are holding the Yimianpo-Zhuhe section, adopting a defensive posture and only sending aircraft for reconnaissance. The National Salvation Army is now organized into five routes, under the command of a general headquarters. The commander-in-chief is Wang Delin, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Liu Wankui. The commanders of the five routes are Wang Delin (1st route), Liu Wankui (2nd route), Jiang Haishan (3rd route), Zhang Zhibang (4th route), and Li Xiangshan (5th route). The first route also has three special operations detachments. The second and fourth routes each have a cavalry detachment. The total number of troops is over 30,000, including about 5,000 "Big Sword" and "Red Spear" troops. The general headquarters has a propaganda department, and many patriotic young volunteers are participating in the work. Each passenger and freight train from Suifenhe to Harbin has slogans such as "(Down with the puppet state of Manzhou, eliminate the traitor Xi Qia and Zhang Jinghui)" pasted on them, all of which were pasted on when the train passed Hengdaohezi. The general headquarters is currently located in Ning'an, and the deputy general headquarters is located in Maqiaohe. After Wang Delin's first route recovered Ning'an, he sent special operations detachments to actively advance towards Yanbian, intending to open up the Sino-Korean border and assist the Korean uprising. Since the 5th, the attacks on Yanji, Sandaogou, Liangshuiquanzi, and Longjingcun have been very fierce. The Chinese and Koreans oppressed by the Japanese in Yanbian have risen up in large numbers in response to the righteous cause, so Wang's first route has increased to 15,000 men. The Japanese army sent two companies of Korean troops to attack, and there were fierce battles on the 6th and 7th, with little progress. They are now planning to send another brigade to attack. The headquarters of the 2nd Division of the Japanese Kwantung Army plans to move to Wujimi in the coming days, intending to advance towards Ning'an and Muling. However, half of the three brigades under the division are scattered in various places and are being held back by the Self-Defense Army near Fangzheng, so their strength to attack Ning'an is probably not great. Fangzheng County fell on April 5th. The Japanese army entered the city at 2:00 PM on the same day. Initially, the Self-Defense Army, led by Feng Zhanhai, Zhao Yi, Gong Changhai, and Ma Xianzhang, concentrated about 10,000 men in Fangzheng and held the three key passes of Sanjiaxinzi, Gaolimaozi, and Dzigou in the south, east, and west of Fangzheng. Li Du and Ding Chao arrived at the front line on the evening of the 4th to command due to the emergency. At 5:00 AM on the 5th, the Japanese army, led by Amano and Hase and the bandit army of Yu Shencheng, totaling 8,000 men, launched a fierce attack, using tanks and armored vehicles to break through the three key passes, and six new-style aircraft of the Kwantung Army flew over the city walls and dropped bombs, totaling over a hundred. Important places in the city were destroyed, and several hundred innocent people were killed or injured. Li and Ding, believing that the city could not be defended, ordered a retreat to the Demoli, Daloulemi, and Xiaoloulebi areas north of Fangzheng at noon to establish a new defensive line. The Wakamatsu company of the Amano brigade of the Japanese army pursued greedily, and was bravely countered by the Gong Changhai brigade in Demoli. The cavalry arrived everywhere, and the enemy was forced to retreat. In this battle, over 300 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese army began to retreat in panic. The main force of the Japanese army has now been transferred back to Wujimi, leaving two companies to cooperate with the bandit army of Yu Shencheng to hold Fangzheng, and they no longer have the strength to advance further. However, Japanese aircraft, in teams of four or five, bomb Yilan all day long. At noon on the 7th, they dropped over 40 bombs, destroying over 20 civilian houses and killing over 30 soldiers and civilians. They bombed again on the 8th, destroying five market houses and killing two pedestrians. Fortunately, Li Du's arrangements were very meticulous and he had anti-aircraft guns, so he was not afraid of the harassment of Japanese aircraft. Ding and Li are also doing their best to replenish their military strength, planning a major counteroffensive in the near future. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e141">Japanese University Professor Discusses the Pros and Cons of Leaving the League of Nations <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Kisaburo Yokota Believes Leaving is a Mistake</p>
<p>Also States That Japan Cannot Act Emotionally</p>
<p>Dr. Yokota's Opinion: Recently, there have been many advocating withdrawal from the League of Nations, and public opinion across the country is very supportive. I believe that there is no reason whatsoever to withdraw from the League of Nations. It is meaningless from a legal standpoint and an even greater misstep from a political standpoint, being nothing more than a purely emotional reaction. From a legal standpoint, those who advocate withdrawal from the League of Nations say that severing relations with the League of Nations can avoid all kinds of interference and that the League of Nations cannot punish Japan as a defendant. This notion is completely wrong, because if Japan decides to withdraw from the League of Nations, it will take two years for it to take effect. Therefore, within two years of withdrawal, Japan must fulfill all obligations under the Covenant. If the League of Nations reviews the Manchurian incident, Japan is naturally obligated to legally comply. Even if relations with the League of Nations are severed after two years, if the Manchurian incident is not resolved after two years, Japan will still be affected by the issue and cannot escape the constraints of the League of Nations Covenant. Recently, those who advocate withdrawal often believe that joining the League of Nations is subject to various legal constraints, and that in the event of a dispute, the resolutions or recommendations of the Council and the General Assembly cannot give full play to their own will. If we withdraw now, legally, regardless of the resolutions of the Council or the recommendations of the General Assembly, without the consent of the country concerned, it will not be bound by its binding force, that is, if the whole assembly is unanimous, only Japan opposes it, it will not be bound by it. In this way, Article 15 of the Covenant can also be ignored for the Manchurian and Shanghai issues. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Article 11 is not important and only opposes the application of Article 15. This is not only a misinterpretation of a legitimate covenant, but in practice, there is no reason to oppose Article 15. This is because the nature of applying Article 15 is the same as applying Article 11. The difference between the two articles is only that, apart from the parties to the dispute, if a party to the dispute agrees with the unanimous recommendation of the whole assembly, the other party to the dispute must not engage in combat. However, it is clear whether Japan is engaging in combat. From a political standpoint, after Japan announces its withdrawal, it will continue to bear all the obligations of the League of Nations Covenant for two years, while losing its position as a representative of the Council and the General Assembly and abandoning various opportunities to assert its claims. As a result, the countries of the League will make judgments based solely on China's one-sided reports. Japan has lost its diplomatic position, and the intentions of various countries and world opinion are quite related. Recalling Germany before the World War, how strong its national power was and how active its military actions were during the war, why did it collapse in the end? Because the global economic blockade was the main reason. Because of the economic blockade, no matter how strong the militarism is, it cannot stand. Today, the countries of Europe, based on the experience of the past war, will use the most evil means once, what will happen? Japan already has a deep militaristic impression on the outside world, and is also actively seeking the advancement of militarism internally. Those who advocate withdrawal from the League of Nations are nothing more than the first step in implementing this policy. Their mistake is ignorance to the extreme. From this point of view, there is no reason to withdraw from the League of Nations in law or politics, there is no need to say it again.</p>
<p>The direct first motive of those who advocate withdrawal is the application of Article 15 of the Covenant. They believe that the League of Nations has ignored Japan's opposition and wants to apply Article 15 to the Manchurian incident. However, according to the explicit provisions of Article 15, whenever there is a dispute that threatens to sever diplomatic relations, if it is not subject to adjudication, Article 15 can automatically be applied at the request of a party to the dispute. Japan cannot blame the League of Nations for its actions. Recalling that at the beginning of the Manchurian incident, due to the conflict of forces, it was about to fall into the severance of diplomatic relations, the League of Nations automatically invoked Article 15 at China's request and naturally applied it to the Manchurian incident. Japan originally had no reason to oppose it, because when Japan joined the League of Nations, it had already agreed to the Covenant, and now it cannot contradict itself by raising objections. In short, the application of Article 15 is a fact that cannot be avoided, then those who advocate withdrawal must say that the League of Nations ignored Japan's claims and allowed China's request. Their lack of wisdom and knowledge, and their misunderstanding of the principles of the Covenant, is extreme.</p>
<p>The second motive of those who advocate withdrawal is that the speeches of the small countries in the League of Nations often criticize Japan from an irresponsible position. This is even more unreasonable. When Italy occupied Corfu, it was severely criticized and attacked by small countries. As a result, Italy had to yield. From this fact, it can be clearly seen that if Japan is angry at the criticism and attacks of small countries at the General Assembly, it will advocate withdrawal. Looking at the world's news magazines, the criticism and attacks of small countries are probably even worse than at the General Assembly. The League of Nations naturally uses world opinion as its guide, because the trend of world opinion can be used as a mirror of the League of Nations. By this mirror, the League of Nations can clearly observe the trend of public opinion in various countries, and Japan only uses the face of a great power as an excuse and hates the attacks of small countries. This is completely an emotional argument. Its lack of understanding is extreme. Purely emotional arguments are not conducive to Japan. However, if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will inevitably be permanently condemned by the world in the future. Japan's position will not be easily reversed from now on.</p>

<p>Appendix: The League of Nations' Handling of the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>After occupying Qiqihar, Japan concentrated its forces on the Beining Railway line in preparation for taking Jinzhou. By November 24, the Japanese vanguard had approached within 30 li east of Jinzhou. On November 25, our representative urgently appealed to the Executive Yuan, requesting the establishment of a neutral zone west and east of Jinzhou, defended by British, French, and Italian troops sent by the League of Nations. If our forces were insufficient to resist the enemy, this unavoidable measure could at least prevent the Japanese army from advancing westward. Moreover, with the defense of foreign troops, the Japanese army would certainly not dare to attack under the pretext of making trouble with foreign troops. Unfortunately, a few days later, our authorities, through the French envoy in Beiping, indicated to Japan that if the Japanese army was willing to return to Shenyang, the Chinese troops would also withdraw inside the Great Wall, which aroused the opposition of the people.</p>
<p>The League of Nations, while strongly in favor of the establishment of a neutral zone, was opposed by Japan to the idea of sending troops to defend it. As a result, it only allowed the British, French, and German embassies in Beiping to send personnel to consult with the commanders of the Chinese and Japanese armies on the spot to establish a neutral zone.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army wanted to attack Jinzhou, the reason it announced was that our troops were concentrated in the Jinzhou area, which was enough to endanger the safety of the Japanese army. In order to avoid conflict, Briand sent a telegram to the Chinese and Japanese governments on November 25, asking them to order the front-line troops to stop military vehicle movements. On November 27, the Japanese government replied to Briand, saying that if the Chinese troops could retreat into Ken City, the Japanese troops could also retreat back to Shenyang. Except when necessary to go to North China via Jinzhou to protect Japanese expatriates, the Japanese army would not cross the neutral boundary line of Jinzhou. The security from Jinzhou West to Shanhaiguan should be maintained by the local Chinese government, but the security from Jinzhou East to Shenyang should be maintained by the Shenyang government. His intention was that the security from Jinzhou to Shenyang should be managed by Japan.</p>
<p>On November 28, the Japanese representative sent another letter to Briand, in addition to reiterating the main points of the previous letter, and expressed dissatisfaction with the League of Nations' interference in the demarcation issue. Its intention was to point out that since our authorities had already entrusted the French minister in Beiping to directly negotiate with the Japanese government, if the League of Nations did not want to interfere, the result would delay the resolution of the issue. The next day, Briand also sent a letter in reply, but our government, due to public opposition, cancelled the previous agreement. At that time, the Japanese foreign minister resigned to the Japanese emperor because he was criticized by various countries for pressing on Jinzhou later. In order to appease the cabinet, the commander of the Kwantung Army withdrew the troops that had approached Jinzhou back to Shenyang on November 29. At this point, our representative also declared the abandonment of the principle of withdrawing troops on a regular basis. Since the meeting on November 22 adopted the principle of sending personnel to investigate, the League of Nations Secretariat and the Japanese delegation had separately engaged in drafting resolutions. Later, due to the Jinzhou neutral zone issue, the draft was shelved. After our country abandoned the request to establish a neutral zone, the Executive Yuan continued to draft the work (to be continued)</p>

<p>Victims Compete for Fire Algae and Wheat Seedlings</p>
<p>Successive Deaths, Spring Epidemics Worrying</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Disasters in northern Anhui are frequent, the vitality of the place has been damaged, and the people's livelihoods are almost gone. The recent spring famine has led to widespread starvation. As far as the 21 counties in northern Anhui are concerned, the disaster is more serious than in central and southern Anhui, but the relief funds allocated are less, which has led to an unusually severe disaster situation in various counties recently. In counties such as Taihe, Hao County, Shou County, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Su County, and Dingyuan, the victims, because the grain was flooded last year and there was no grain to eat, peeled off tree bark, ground it into coarse powder, mixed it with water algae, grass roots, leaves and other things, steamed it and ate it. Although it is difficult to swallow, it is better than being hungry. All rivers, streams, and swamps that produce water algae have supervisors guarding them day and night, not allowing others to steal them. Water algae on the market sells for as much as 200 coins per catty. According to Xu Baizheng, the chief of the Taihe emergency relief, the county suffered a hail disaster first, followed by flooding, and the disaster situation was the most tragic. What people would not eat in a good year and used to feed pigs, the victims are now competing to eat. Mr. Xu brought specimens of the victims' food, totaling as many as 12 kinds. After eating, the victims' faces are mostly yellow and swollen, the price of rice is like pearls and firewood like cassia, it is conceivable. Recently, tree bark and fire algae have been almost exhausted. The victims are banding together and going to the fields to cut wheat seedlings and cook them at home. However, due to the lack of nutrition, the victims' faces are swollen after eating. Therefore, personnel from Su County who came to Bengbu to receive relief advocated the distribution of edible salt to provide relief. The cooking of wheat seedlings by the victims has become a widespread phenomenon. However, in remote markets in the northwest, women and children are openly bought and sold. Such situations are often found even in Bengbu City. Moreover, the victims gather in places where they have no way to make a living and no way to beg, and they rob food everywhere. In the Suixi area of Su County, a family has been without food for several days, and the child is very hungry, crying and begging for food. The mother was pestered by the child and made a cake shape out of mud to give to the child, hoping to reduce the crying. It can also be said to be tragic. Although there are occasional porridge factories in various counties and towns, there are too many victims, and there is a feeling that there are too many monks and too little porridge, and it is impossible to benefit everyone. When the victims have been hungry for a long time, they become skinny and occasionally faint and die with clear water flowing from their mouths. The disaster area is wide, deaths are successive, and corpses are lying in the fields,无人掩埋. It is expected that when the weather is humid and warm, epidemics will inevitably occur, thinking about this, I am worried.</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Government Relief Water Disaster Committee released emergency relief in northern Anhui, totaling 6,730 tons of American wheat. Due to the impact of the Shanghai War, transportation was difficult, resulting in delayed inspections and releases. Later, 2,000 tons were converted into cash and released to take both into account. As for Quan Shaowu, the newly appointed director of the Anhui Northern Relief Office of the Disaster Area Working Group of the Association, who came to Bengbu, is quite lacking in handling relief matters</p>
<p>Representatives Guo Zhongyi and Jiang Zijing and others are particularly strong in opposition. Someone recently telegraphed Zhu Qinglan in Shanghai to ask him to punish him in order to maintain relief affairs and save the people. (April 13)</p>

<h3 id="e144">Financial Market Stagnation, Sparse Transactions, and the Continued Decline of Exchange Rates <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's financial situation saw the market continue to be cold and quiet, resulting in an inability to develop various transactions. Banks had no busy schedule due to the Saturday afternoon holiday. The morning exchange rate was 7.03 cents, and the afternoon rate was 7.02125 cents, a drop of about 0.01 cents in both markets. Compared to the previous day's morning rate, it fell by more than 0.015 cents, indicating that it is difficult for the market to recover and that further declines are foreseeable. Interbank lending rates remained at 0.015, with little change, but the money supply tended to be quite loose. Bank rates were at 0.06, and the "Liu Tou" premium was only around 0.01. Transactions of promissory notes amounted to over 1.9 million, slightly better than in previous days. Outward remittance drafts amounted to 475,000 in the morning market, and only 25,000 in the afternoon market. Bank transactions were 400,000 in the morning market and 300,000 in the afternoon market. Foreign firms' inward and outward remittances totaled over 1.1 million. In terms of silver remittances, foreign firms accounted for over 3.7 million, including over 500,000 in exchange and mortgage loans, and over 900,000 in merchandise loans. Chinese firms accounted for over 4.1 million, including over 400,000 in customs duties, over 500,000 in foreign currency, and over 700,000 in merchandise loans. Silver shops and public silver offices' remittances totaled over 26 million, foreign public offices' remittances totaled over 3.4 million, silver "Liu Tou" funds were over 2.5 million, foreign exchange funds were nearly 1.2 million, and small silver shops' transactions were over 400,000. Small Jiangnan silver coins remained unchanged at 0.061, with only 2,000 jiao transacted in the morning market. Small Guangdong silver coins were 0.06115 in the morning market and 0.0611 in the afternoon market, with 105,000 jiao transacted in the morning and afternoon markets. Copper coins rose by 1,000 "wen" to 416,000 "wen."</p>
<h3 id="e145">Long-Term Transactions Reach Extreme Desolation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Second Extension Failed to Meet the Deadline</p>
<p>A General Ledger Impossible to Sort Out</p>
<p>Currently, six long-term settlement periods are nearing completion. The funds due in half a month must be cut off from the previous "worm me" situation. In past years, this time was so prosperous, with busy and lively transactions and considerable prices. Unexpectedly, after the Shanghai Incident, various industries stagnated. For some of the maturing funds in the financial sector, not only was it impossible to claim them back, but also the funds that should have been settled at the end of last year, which had once been transferred to the current account as long-term funds, have not been repaid a single cent to this day. Now, with the second extension of the funds due in a quarter of a month, they have failed to meet the deadline. The general ledger is simply impossible to sort out. Therefore, in the past two days, there was no clue as to how to claim the funds that were due in a quarter of a month. Naturally, it is difficult to fully supply new funds. As a result, there were only small transactions to decorate the market. It is said that yesterday's volume was only in the range of 300,000 to 400,000. Although there was no standard interest rate, it was at least above ten taels. As for long-term deposits, it is said that most are prepared to be transferred. If so, the financial sector can still cope, but there is a risk of being overwhelmed. However, the overall bleak situation is truly reminiscent of the past.</p>

<p>Long Live the Republic of China, A certain gentleman participated in the Battle of Jinan. He belonged to Su's regiment under Fang Zhenwu's command. The May 3rd Incident occurred. The isolated army defended the city. When the ammunition was exhausted, the entire nation broke through the encirclement. Crying "Long Live the Republic of China!" and holding the national emblem, his courage suddenly increased. The sound of killing shook the sky. The regiment suffered very little loss. In this Shanghai battle, the gentleman again led his troops to Shanghai to assist the 19th Route Army. In the Miaohang and Jiangwan areas, they fought fiercely for dozens of days. According to the gentleman's account, whenever in a crisis, he always used the slogan "Long Live the Republic of China!" to stir up the morale of the army, which always turned danger into safety and wiped out the captives. The speaker said, "Although we have no sharp weapons, our hot blood is indeed our sharp weapon." Therefore, the sound of "Long Live the Republic of China!" on the battlefield is the only treasure of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>The First Martyr of the Shanghai War. The Japanese invasion of Shanghai was sudden. It was what is called the behavior of thieves. At that time, a large contingent of our army was stationed in Zhenru. The front line of the Zhabei Railway Station was guarded by military police. At 11 p.m. on the night of January 28th, the enemy attacked with armored vehicles. The momentum was quite fierce. Our army only had short guns and stray bullets, and the disparity in numbers made it difficult to sustain. A loyal and brave nameless hero, carrying explosives, threw himself at the enemy. The bomb exploded and destroyed the vehicle. The enemy, thinking it was a landmine, was in a panic. Our army took advantage of the situation to pursue and finally won a great victory. And our Republic of China's national hero also shed blood on Baoshan Road. His loyalty and bravery will forever be known to the world. This was the first martyr of the Shanghai War.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Begonia and Butterfly Dreams in the Park <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The scenery of Xidi Lake and Mountain is boundless. In past years, horses and carriages thronged, and men and women were like clouds. Now, all have been chased away in the chaos. Returning to the old place, I seek to relieve my boredom. I decided to enter the city park with a friend. The park used to have many flowers and trees, but they have been ravaged by wind and rain. The rouge is all in disarray. Only within a fence on the west side, several weeping begonia trees are planted. They are called "iron stems" and also "drunken beauties." The tall trunks have dense branches. The flowers bloom especially abundantly. They are round and jade-like, with powdery flesh and soft fat. The luster is like a fairy, and the charm is unmatched. It is truly like a beauty's drunken sleep. Moreover, looking around, the peach and apricot branches are almost bare, but these alone are full of smiles, just like the towering Lingguang Hall. Could it be that the weak begonia has turned into a pine and cypress that withers later? It is fitting that all the visitors in the park linger and are reluctant to leave. Thus, the beauty, with her drunkenness, turns to intoxicate the guests. Alas, what kind of world is this? Disaster is imminent. How can one get drunk in front of the flowers and end this life? Therefore, I record it with two quatrains:</p>
<p>The fragrant time is all entrusted to the chaos of war,</p>
<p>What a pity that the beautiful gardens are falling red.</p>
<p>Only two or three begonia trees remain,</p>
<p>The beauty still smiles in the spring breeze.</p>
<p>The landscape of broken rivers and mountains is renewed,</p>
<p>The spirit of flowers is seen in drunkenness.</p>
<p>Relying on a piece of rouge color,</p>
<p>Holding up the ten miles of spring in Ronghu Lake.</p>

<h3 id="e162">The Shanghai Battle and Armaments (11) - One Hidden <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Tank Vehicles: Scientific advancement leads to the mechanization of military circles. The rapidity of movement, the greatness of attack power, and the possession of defensive power are improving day by day. Now, let's talk about mechanized tank vehicles. This vehicle is also known as an armored car or war chariot. There are male and female distinctions. Males are over thirty-seven tons, while females are just around twenty tons. However, they are all surrounded by steel plates. The vehicle can carry two artillery operators, two drivers, and two reconnaissance officers. It is specifically used to break through trenches and barbed wire. It can also climb mountains and cross hills. Even in dense forests, movement is very free. Therefore, it is called a land cruiser. As for the origin of the war chariot, it originated in ancient China. Sun Tzu mentioned the use of prepared war chariots. However, the war chariot at that time was a four-wheeled vehicle capable of carrying more than ten people, covered with leather to protect against arrows and stones. In the Crimean War of 1853, the British army used steam-powered vehicles to transport military supplies. Later, due to the advancement of internal combustion engines, the power of the Dissel Engine over Turfin (divided into air turbines, gas turbines, steam turbines, and hydraulic turbines) made operation convenient. Before long, a man named Thomas, Tank, Bluro from the Setford Industrial Chamber of Commerce in Setford, England, completely reformed the vehicle's structure, giving it a brand new look. Therefore, the vehicle was named after him.</p>
<p>[P A Heroic Death (1) - Mo Yi</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, it's been chaotic these past two days. We don't understand what they're doing. It wasn't until the mobilization order came down today that we knew we were going to fight the 'dwarf devils'. I heard that the 19th Route Army brothers beat the 'dwarf devils' so badly they fled in defeat. Is that really true? If it is, then I'll be happy. Ever since I was twenty years old, when my home was burned down by bandits, I've been in the army. It's been almost eight years now, and not a year has gone by that I haven't been on the front lines. Luckily, I've been lucky, and I haven't died once. But fighting, fighting, it's all been against our own people, and I'm really getting tired of it. I've always wanted to change things up, but there's never been a chance. But now it's great, we're going to fight the 'dwarf devils'. People say the 'dwarf devils' are very powerful, but I don't know if that's true. I remember that year you fought them in Jinan. What do you think of them compared to us? Damn it, powerful? I'm not afraid of the 'dwarf devils'!"</p>
<p>("Old Zhao, don't listen to what people say. The 'dwarf devils' only have better weapons than us, but in every other way, they can't compare to us. Remember that time in Jinan, we only had one battalion, and we repelled a regiment of them. Do you think they're any good? Didn't you fight bandits in Jiangxi last year? To be honest, the 'dwarf devils' are much easier to fight than bandits! Fighting bandits is like fighting adults, fighting 'dwarf devils' is like playing with kids. As the saying goes, 'short people have a lot of schemes,' but what's strange to me is that when it comes to fighting, why don't the 'dwarf devils' have any schemes?" Haha!") Old Zhang made a dismissive expression on his face, casually picked up a small wooden stick from the table in front of the bed, pretending to play with it, and said with a laugh ("Really? Don't fool me!: : : No matter what, whether they're powerful or weak, I'm definitely going to fight them! Old Zhang, you have to fight hard too! If you don't, humph, if anyone doesn't fight, damn it, I'll beat them to death first!") Old Zhao said excitedly, reaching out two arms from the quilt, clenching his fists, making a big circle in the air, and punching upwards, as if those two palms could kill two enemies. ("Okay, Old Zhao, it's getting late. Let's sleep. Tomorrow we have to go to the front lines to kill 'dwarf devils'!") ("Where are we going tomorrow? Zhabei? Jiangwan? Wusong? I don't want to be assigned to rear-line work.")</p>
<p>("Jiangwan. It's the front line. It's the very front line. Aren't you happy now?")</p>
<p>("Of course I'm happy. It's my bad temper, if I have something on my mind, my eyelids just won't close.: : : :") Although Old Zhao said that, his snoring was already coming from his nose.</p>
<p>("He said he couldn't sleep. Ha: : :") Old Zhang turned off the light and also went to sleep.</p>
<p>(In an instant, this room controlled by darkness was filled everywhere with the great spirit of every warrior)</p>
<p>of serving the country and killing the enemy.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Cooperation between the Military and the People <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>Soldiers protect the people with their lives, and the people pay taxes to support the soldiers. Therefore, soldiers and the people are originally on the same front line, and the relationship between them is originally very close and loving.</p>
<p>Now, when the country is in trouble, I think of a small piece of history from the Hongchang era. I remember the elders saying that during the Hong Yang Rebellion, those who fled to Jiangbei, upon hearing that the seven counties of Songjiang Prefecture had been recovered by Li Hongzhang's army, rushed home. At that time, the Hong Yang troops were based in the east in Suzhou and Changzhou, and in the west in Jiahe. The area around Songjiang was still disturbed and unstable, but the general population already deeply believed that Li Hongzhang could provide thorough protection, in a reliable and trustworthy manner, and everyone hurried back to their hometowns. The spirit of military-civilian cooperation at that time can be seen in general.</p>
<p>Now, the 19th Route Army has resisted the brutality of the Japanese for more than forty days. In the areas of Zhenru and Nanxiang, there are many stationed troops, and the sound of artillery shakes the eardrums every day. However, the general public remains calm and settled as usual. Those with money provide some money, and those with goods provide some goods. They are very polite, and they even decline with thanks. It can truly be said that they do not take a single needle or thread. This is also a manifestation of military-civilian cooperation, which is particularly rare.</p>
<p>Now, a month or so has passed since the ceasefire. Why is it that in the Changshu and Kunshan areas, the number of fleeing people is increasing day by day? Not only that, but even in Songjiang and Jiaxing, which are not war zones, there are countless people, young and old, fleeing to different places every day. I asked them, "The war is not tense, why are you fleeing here?" They shook their heads and refused to say. I asked, "Is your area peaceful or chaotic?" They still shook their heads and refused to say. I asked, "Since the war is not tense and the area must be peaceful, why are you fleeing to Shanghai, where rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as expensive as gold?" They shook their heads again and refused to say. Alas! I know the reason. Is it perhaps because of the lack of cooperation between the military and the people, or perhaps too much cooperation? Originally, since there are many troops, good and bad may inevitably be mixed together, but everything depends on whether the commander is capable or not.</p>
<p>When the 19th Route Army was fighting bravely against the enemy, did the 19th Route Army not dig trenches? Why did the people help with smiles on their faces? Did the 19th Route Army have no supplies? Why did the people send them in thousands and tens of thousands? In short, the current army must make the people love them when they see them, and not make the people fear them when they see them. Only then can it be an army that is unique in resisting Japan, and only then can it be considered an army of our people.</p>

<h3 id="e164">General Ma's Song <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ru'an's Owner</p>
<p>Last autumn, General Ma's battle at Jiangqiao shook the world. I wrote a song to praise him, but when I heard of General Ma's defection, this poem was also abandoned in my worn-out box. Yesterday, I read a telegram about General Ma's reversal, which made me feel very happy. Therefore, my poem cannot but be preserved. I am recording it now to examine his future. The bandits in Guandong are all heroes, and the general's horsemanship is especially outstanding. White bones form mountains as armor rolls back, one horse is like a dragon, and ten thousand horses are choked. Suddenly, like a tiger changing, he becomes a city defender, and for ten years he sits and whistles, clearing the border dust. Not only does his mighty power shake foreign customs, but children dare not even hear his name. One morning, the drums of war sounded in Liaoyang, and the Ezo crossed the sea to plunder. The horns of Xuan Tu city sounded their death knell, and more than one hundred thousand brave soldiers were stationed in empty camps. Iron cavalry galloped across a thousand miles, and throwing their whips, they wanted to cut off the Nen River. The general clenched his fist, tore his clothes, and rose up, saying, "This is the time for a man to serve his country!" Eight thousand disciples followed like clouds, and they cheered under the tent, each ready to die. The giant blade in his hand scrapes the sky, and we will see him driving the bandits like sheep. In the ninth month, on the day of Guihai, the bandits launched a major attack, and flying ships roared, with bullets like rain. The turtle capsized the earth's hole, the river flowed backward, and blood bathed the black and yellow, making the location confusing. The general's order came out with the power of a mountain, and ten thousand horses silently emerged from the fort. The yellow clouds fell downwards, and the flags opened, and the general charged into the formation on a single horse. The red fire shattered the whale waves, and the general chased the bandits on the Jiangqiao. He turned his horse and leaped ten zhang high, and with ten charges and ten decisions, he overturned the bandit nest. It is good for a man to die on this land, and anyone who retreats will taste my bloody blade. My spirit increases, and the bandits shrink back. We continue our efforts without stopping. The sky shakes, the earth trembles, and dragons and snakes move. We only see the bandits before, and we only see the bandits behind. In the wilderness, we only hear the sound of thunder, and the heads of greedy wolves fall in pieces. The general's men and horses are all heavenly dragons. They enter the formation black and leave the formation red. The mountains and rivers north of the pass are all supported by him, and who can compare to him in first-class border merits? Alas, ever since the Hu cavalry herded the Liao wilderness, more than seventy cities have fallen at the mere sight of them. The one victory at Jiangqiao shattered the bandits' courage, and they warned each other not to offend the horses of Longjiang. Looking north across the pass, our tearful eyes are dry, and lost geese cry in the clouds. Tell the general not to change his will, and to kill the bandits with all his heart, as in the beginning. After the success, wait for a painting of Lingyan Pavilion to be made. My pen can still sing one song again and write it for you.</p>

<p>— Gan Fu</p>
<p>I read the two poems titled "Spring Regret" in your newspaper's local supplement on the eleventh. Now I follow the original rhyme and present it to you for your consideration.</p>
<p>Disaster starts from internal conflicts, and I have felt pain for a long time, suffering from years of waste without caring. It is pitiful that when one insults oneself, others will also insult. A great country and rivers are regrettable and have sunk.</p>
<p>Fragrant sea waves overturned by butterfly matchmakers, the east wind is cunning and jealous of the flowers blooming. It is pitiful that under the spring hooves of the barbarian horses, a miserable white turns red, rolling in.</p>

<p>Seeking Poems for the "Blood Flower Collection": The Asian Culture Society, in view of the declining national power and the depressed morale of the people, feels that without promotion, there is no way to inspire them. Especially in the recent bloody battle in the Northeast and Shanghai, our country has suffered greatly from the trampling of Japanese bandits, and the tragic situation is difficult to describe in writing. Therefore, they have specially hired Mr. Li Jianweng and others to edit the "Blood Flower Collection," seeking poems that describe the displacement of the war and are full of patriotic and inspiring spirit. Whether newly written or old works, complete rhymes or long songs, all are welcome (new-style poems are also collected). Once adopted, a small remuneration will be offered. Please send your contributions to the Asian Culture Society on Kang Nao Tuo Road.</p>
<p>The "Plain People's Evening News" to be Published Regularly: Shanghai newspapers have always been noticed by Chinese and foreign people, but most are published in the morning. Recently, Mr. Zhang and others, due to the timeliness of news and the fluency of Huang, have specially followed the example of evening editions in major European and American ports, organized the "Plain People's Evening News," which will publish one sheet per day. Its main purpose is to explore the real needs of the people and guide the major trends of society, striving to publish true and rapid news in detail, so that people in Shanghai can learn about the current events of the day during the dimming of lights, and people in other ports can also learn about the news from the sea when the dawn breaks. The preparation of the newspaper has been completed, and it has been decided to publish it on the sixteenth of this month.</p>
