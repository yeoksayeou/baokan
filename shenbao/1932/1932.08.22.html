<h3>日軍突襲熱河元</h3>
<p>日人圖攫熱河之用。心早己如司馬昭之路人皆知。前此飛炸朝陽。即準備爲侵熱之實力發動。其所以猝然中止者。徒以我義勇軍之在後牽制耳。説者謂因爲有義勇軍之牽制。故汪張辭職之政潮日人雖視爲侵熱發動之好機會。然亦未敢輕易動手。我國人見日人不於此可動之時機發動。遂亦因自寛慰。以爲日人欲掃盪我義勇軍。當非短時間所可能。則其實行侵熱窥平津之暴舉。至少當在冬盡春初之後。而於是戒懼之心弛防衛之備懈。奮起抗日之勇氣。亦日即衰怠。嗚呼。果如是者。我國人之夢。眞無無日醒矣。</p>
<p>蓋日人之併吞滿蒙。爲其整個計劃。欲通外蒙。非得熱河不可。故其進取熱河。爲其寤寐所祈求之物。豈遂以區區義勇軍之牽制而稍阻。其發動之時期亦視其各方布置之如何而定豈遂以一時之小勝負爲轉移。前數日北方即傅武藤全權一旦發表。錦朝線軍事立即發動。是則日人之侵熱。早己預定步驟。苟有時機。詎肯坐失。今日軍來果己突然進攻。由義縣及朝陽寺衝入熱境。直撲北營子南嶺。據湯玉麟電告南嶺己失守。我軍退集北營子。窺其行動。絶非如前次之藉口石本事件。僅以爆炸朝陽作爲試探而止。性質之危險嚴重。可國内要電</p>
<h3>熱邊戰事己發動錦州日鐵甲車衝入熱河境圖取朝陽南嶺發生激戰戰綫延及口北營子日機在熱邊投彈建築物悉被炸毁</h3>
<p>山海關月前日軍攻熱、深恐遼西義軍躡其後、故未遽敢積極行動、近以義軍前次攻錦攻瀋之役、鋒鋭受挫、一時士氣沮喪、迄今仍未振復、故於十八日起、斷然反守爲攻、錦州日軍、遂調大兵、紛向熱邊出動、圖取朝陽、以作根據、同時並對遼西義軍、取大包圍形勢、料在短期内、熱邊將有重大發展、今午日鐵甲車仍續向南嶺猛攻、另有裝甲汽車進攻口北營子、我董旅竭力抵抗士氣奮旺、晨有日機三架飛朝陽威脅、并發傅單、告我駐軍退出朝陽、以免塗炭地方、綏中日軍近並積極重築大飛機塲、（二十一日專電）</p>
<p>北平本壚官方消息、熱河省政府、昨日澈夜有急電到平、謂二十日錦州日軍、遣派鐵甲車多列爲先鋒、由義縣及朝陽寺衝入熱境、與我駐南嶺董旅發生激烈衝突、戰綫延長至口北營子一帶、至晚間發電時、尚在交鋒中、（二十一日專電）</p>
<p>北平湯玉麟電平稱、一·日甲車開至破廟子、與我方實行開火、現在正抵抗中、二·十九午日機在朝陽飛散傅單、造謡警告義軍回鄉、三·十九晚日甲車開赴南嶺、與我方接觸、旋以南嶺我隊退至口北營子集中、朝陽至口北營子百數十里、增援困難、（二十一日專電）</p>
<p>北平二十晨日機七架、向錦熱邊境擲彈、一切建築物村莊大樹木、悉被炸燬、並散放傅單、中有凡與義軍同謀抵抗日本軍者、即殺勿赦、等荒謬言詞、居民恐慌、逃避一空、又日機二十下午二時、向南嶺轟炸我軍根據地車站郵局均被燬損北平熱河駐軍參謀長李贊庭、軍事代表孟昭田因熱河軍事緊急、將請各將領開會、討論辦法、（二十一日專電）</p>
<p>錦州日軍與熱河軍、在朝陽寺南嶺間開單·日軍從朝陽寺得鈴木部隊之應援、激戰數時間後、於昨午後九時擊破熱河軍、佔領南嶺、（二十一日電通電）</p>
<p>瀋陽援救石本氏事、關東軍持冷静態度、委由錦州部隊辦理、錦州部隊則持愼重、即十九日熱軍之開槍事件、擬以地方解决之方針、又湯玉麟之態度不明、故將石本問題、及熱境内之義軍問題、發出警告、概由張參議轉致、要求湯氏誠意之回答、視回答如何、再開始適當之行動、（二十一日電通電）</p>
<p>北平據今日華報稱、最近日機曾屢至榆關以北投燃燒彈、致有中國村落若干横被焚毁、惟日機來炸時農民皆事先得訊、逃入高梁墳中、故無甚死傷、俟日機飛回後、此等無家可歸之農民、均大批逃入關内、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>東京據北平來電、今晨四時、湯玉麟急電張學良、謂二十日在錦州之日軍、以鐵甲車爲先導、由義州朝陽寺侵入熱河省内、與熱河軍發生衝突、戰線延長發展至北票附近、現尚在激戰中、（二十一日電通社電）</p>

<h3>朱家驊閉幕辭</h3>
<p>教育部願以最大的努力</p>
<p>平均發展全國體育事業</p>
<p>中國所需要之體育基礎</p>
<p>培養國民合作團結精神</p>
<p>全國體育會議今天閉幕了、這次我們的會期、雖則只有五天、但在這五天中我們能夠得到許多體育專家與許多擔負各地方體育責任的同志來集合討論、交換意見、擬訂了一個國民體育實施方案、確己爲中國的體育前途闢一新紀元、教育部很感謝諸位遠道而來的熱忱、尤其感謝這幾天諸位不憚揮汗的努力、諸位這幾天的努力、己經結有一個極大的果實、這個果實、是以前所没有的、這次會議以前、各地方努力的同志、各有各的觀念、各有各的辦法、意見不一致、行動不一致、因此數十年來、全國體育的改進、繼少、有滿意的成效、而教育部方面、因爲各地方同志意見的不能統一、行動的不能一致、無從相互合作、縱有使全國體育作整個改進的願望、也苦於以難使其實現、現在諸位己經擬定了一種整個的方案、這個整個方案至少是諸位统一意志的表現、有了這個統了一的意志、從此教育部與諸位可以準此統一的意志、酌量實際的情形、共同工作、以謀全國體育的改進、教育部極願以最大的努力、使全國體育事業、與其他事業、作平均的發展、與諸位更始、亦願諸位本此統一意志的精神、與教育部及努力體育改進同志、恊力工作國民體育的宗旨、脱離不了國家、脱離不了社會、改進國民體育、必須在國家與社會的意義下去實行、才不會失其成效、尤其是今日的中國、外有强敵的壓迫、内有匪禍天災、交相造亂、國家危殆、社會破産、除非全國四萬萬的同胞、全體動員、國家决不得救、社會决不得救、所謂個人亦必同歸於盡、要全國動員、就不能不犧牲個件的自由國民體育的改進、在今日的中國環境中、是要培養全國動員的體質基礎、我們要謀每一個國民的體質、有充分而平均的發展、但尤要的、是使每一個國民、有强健而活潑的體質、作爲團結禦侮、合作興國的基礎、過去的比賽體育、雖則是國民體育改進中、所不能避免的過渡現象、但其結果流於個性的自由發展、超過社育的發展是不容諱飾的、每個學校裏、儘有大肌肉極發逹的運動員、而一般的同學、却仍其面黃肌瘦、駝腰曲背毫不振作的狀態、對於社會不能發生好印象、這就是忽略社會的觀念、</p>
<p>中國現在所需要的、是全國國民的團結合作、因爲運動必需合作、必需團結、所以我們在體育上、特别要注意這一點、因此我們更加需要的、是一般程度的普遍提高、使能合作團結、所以這次會議、諸位於所訂的方案中、懸定［培養民國合作團結之精神］一目標、兄弟個人很欽佩諸位的卓見、希望諸位這次回去努力改進工作的時候、時時記住這個目標、使受諸位的指導作體質培養的國民、人人能夠得到合作團結、强健而又活潑的體質基礎、則這次體育會議的開會、其影響所及、豈僅全國體育一事、得有極大改進而己、</p>
<h3>王正廷致答詞</h3>
<p>補充三點意見</p>
<p>强國與强種均從體育起</p>
<p>提倡體育以代替惡習慣</p>
<p>議决方案希望切實推行</p>
<p>諸位應主席之命代全體會員致答詞、甚爲欣幸、且甚慚愧、</p>
<p>今日在座諸位第一要感激教育部招待之周至、特代表全體會員、向教育部部長次長、籌備委員會褚先生致謝、</p>
<p>此次會議的方案精神褚先生己有説明、兹不道代表會員略爲補充數點而己</p>
<p>中國人向不認識身體之重要、向來只注重藝術道德方面、雖然古時曾列付御爲六藝之一科、到了現在、却没有人注意了、吾人常説、要謀長生不老究意怎樣才能長生不老、此生百年之後、强健的身體遺傅於後代、即爲長生不老所以强國與强種均在體育方面起頭、此爲補充的第一點</p>
<p>人羣社會、一舉一動均爲習慣所養成中國人的惡習慣、有極大的危險賭博與雅片均係自殺自己、中國人所以要有惡習慣者在於無好的體育</p>
<p>來代替他、習慣之養成在於精神不、足世界上有强健身體之人種、如盎格魯薩克遜人、一個人有體育場兩個人有體育場的、决不會有惡的習慣了、我們乃把好的習慣如屋内屋外的運動、提倡起來、以代替壞的習慣、這是要補充的第二點、</p>
<p>中國人的大毛病會議是一件事實行又是一件事、開會時精神甚好、會議完畢後、即朿之高閣了、體育關係民族存亡、萬萬不可如此希望的確切實實行在政府方面、希望能把方案竭力推行、在會員方面、希望帮助政府也努力去推　力案這是補充的第三點完了</p>
<h3>大會宣言</h3>

<p>爲我國新體育發動開始</p>

<p>爲今後新體育之新旗幟</p>
<p>教育部爲積極提倡國民體育、特召集本會議、以謀今後全國體育之進行與發展際此强隣壓境、國難當頭、本會議彌覺所負使命、更爲重大、竭大衆之心力擬訂一國民體育實施方案以待施行、於此有應爲國人告者</p>
<p>我國近百年來、不特受帝國主義者種種侵略而危及其生存即以國民身體日就衰弱言之如不思所以强種種身之方雖云四萬萬之衆、亦將歸於天然淘汰、本會議認爲提倡國民體育實爲延續民族生命之重要途徑、惟實施國民體育絶不能任其畸形發展、務必切實推行、力求普及、使全國國民、成爲健全分子、然後國民體育、始奏其功、故本會議尤認普遍發展爲實施國民體育之重要條件唯普及而愈能提高、唯提高則更有進步、深望全國國民對此有明確之認識以最大之努力爲不斷之進行、</p>
<p>本會議於此更鄭重聲明者本會議閉幕之後即我國新體育發動之始、以後吾人應依據國情與國民性、爲實施國民體育之標準、凡不背科學原則、及適合人類天性之種種體育活動不以其來源之不同有所軒輊、要皆根據此標準、各取其長、而一律提倡之、抄襲模倣、固失其民族之自信力、故步自封、亦失其民族之偉大性、故本會議爲我國體育前途計深望全國國民、對於種</p>
<p>身處活動方法、抱［擇善而從］之態度、母分新舊中外、咸立於今後新體育旗幟之下、促國民體育之猛進、</p>
<h3>昨日大會閉幕禮禇民誼報</h3>
<p>南京光華攝</p>
<p>此次本會議所决方案、均本此旨、詳爲規定、如鍳於己往體育之漫無方針、體育範圍與目標之擬訂、感於從前無專設機關之主持體育而有規定全國體育行政組織之决議關於人才之養成、經費之確定并經詳細討論、提也且體意見、他如設備之原則、考成之方法課程教材之整理、與夫國術之特别提倡及分年實施計劃等等、無不與以上所示各點、作一貫之主張、理論事實、兩相兼顧如能舉國一致、共策進行、我中華民族其有復興之望乎謹此宣言、</p>
<h3>會員離京回籍</h3>
<p>褚民誼陳奎生來滬</p>
<p>南京二十一日電、全會會員二十晚、除本京會員己離社外、其餘多數會員、己離京回籍、勵志社房間己退租十六個、明日午刻全體離社、郝更生等准二十一晚車回平、褚民誼陳奎生赴滬、</p>
<h3>大會之種種</h3>
<p>招待會員今午止</p>
<p>大會通告、本會議延期招待會員、延至二十二日上午十二時止、</p>
<p>會員讚美勤奮體育叢書</p>
<p>上海勤奮書局出版之體育叢書、係全國體育專家吴藴瑞袁敦禮金兆均吴邦偉蔣湘青金兆均宋君復彭文餘王復旦王能飛等廿餘體育專家合著、己出三十餘種、陳列大會會場、見之者無不稱爲空前之體育專書、爲實施國民體育方案之良佳工具、再上海標準運動懸具公司、陳列國貨運動器公司、亦得會員之讚美、</p>
<h3>會塲花花絮絮</h3>
<p>體育與國術論戰大會中討論主設立國術專門學校一案時、會員即分兩派、一方謂國術爲體育之一部、不必另設專所研究、可含併於體育專門學校内、一方則極力反對、謂國術乃我國固有之運動、無論於健身强國、均有莫大之成效、且於愛國思想、尤可充分表現、反觀今之體育、以抄襲他國爲能事、反將國粹棄而不願、且亦忘其根本、故爲補救國術人才欠缺起見、非設專院研究與提倡不可、當變方辯論時、激昻之狀、溢於意表、尤以馬良之離座拍桌、高聲演説爲最、但表决時、後者失敗</p>
<p>某專家快人快語某專家於討論舉行運動會應充分聘請專家籌備案時、謂中央體育塲在籌備之先、因無專家參加籌劃、致虚耗百餘萬、建築會場於離城十餘異之山麓、因京中尚無電車通行、運動者僅限於極少數之汽車階級、平民無法享受、二十年後本利計算、國家損失逹一千六百萬之鉅、此爲不聘專家籌備之弊也、又謂體育係整個的、應不分男女、更不必冠以男女專家之稱號、該案因此通過、</p>
<p>囬教之忠實信徒專家馬良回教信徒、秃其頂而長其髯、衣白色衫、長至膝蓋、背後開一岔、一若西裝大衣、袖管長小、褲管長至脚跟白、襪黑鞋、服裝異於他人、談論時每滔滔不絶、口若懸河、餐時每獨食、因未便破戒、可謂信徒矣、</p>
<p>女會員之眞精神大會中會員五人、列席者數人、自開幕之日起、至閉幕之日止、每次均按時出席、不稍懈怠、亦常起立負責發言、其精神堪稱崇也</p>
<p>國民體育實施方案（一）</p>
<h3>一引言</h3>
<p>凡欲解决一問題、須先認清問題自身之意義及範圍而後方能論及解决方法體育二字之意義在各種不同時代不同社會中甚有出入、且一般人心目之體育各有不同之見解、如不先將其意義闡明、範圍劃清、率爾規定其實施方案、不但着手之時無所適從、即實施之後、難免結果與始願相違、至爲危險、故於草定此方案之先、不得不將體育之意義及範圍略爲申述之、</p>
<p>體育二字自常人視之不過爲身體之鍛錬、第自生物學心理學逹以來、傅統之心身二元説既不能存在、且近代教育之目的并非只爲知識之供給、而爲整個機體生活之訓練、於是吾人始深切明瞭、體育之表面雖爲大肌肉活動、但由此以引起生理上心理上之變動甚多、而爲整個機體生活訓練必不可少之方法、故體育之意義非僅身體之鍛錬、乃從身體各種大肌肉活動中供給教育之機會之謂也、換言之欲逹到教育上之各種目標、身體活動乃爲一主要之手段與方法、機體之發育與健康之促進、爲身體活動必然之結果、體育不僅逹此目的、尚有其他教育上之重要目標、如社會道德、基本生活技能、善用閑暇之方法、公民必具之態度與能力、無不能藉各種身體活動以訓練而培養之、故體育與教育不能分之爲二、所不同者體育只以身體大肌肉活動爲逹到教育目標之方法、而教育所採用逹到其目標之方法、除體育尚有他種而己因此所有體育之設施、均須以能逹到整個教育目的爲標準、同時凡非以身體大肌肉活動教育方法者、均不得謂之爲體育也、爲對於體育範圍明確認識起見、以下數點不得不於此處説明之</p>
<h3>（一）體育與軍事訓練</h3>
<p>軍事訓練之目的、爲供給國民軍事知識、訓練國民禦侮之能力、及培養國民民族之意識、現在各級學校之軍事訓練率督注重步兵之操演、且因教練殊欠嚴格、不獨眞正軍訓之目的難逹、即盲從命令不畏死之士兵亦不可得、欲逹軍事訓練目的、一方面須力求科學與工業之發逹、社會與經濟之安甯與稳固、一方面除於國民相當年齡予以嚴格澈底軍人生活之訓練外、必須於無形之中多方培養民族意識、及禦侮有力學校之中各種學科均須以此爲目的、尤以歷史、地理、公民等科爲最有效、至於體育乃爲供給國民充分發育之身體、勇敢機敏之精神、無形之中對於逹到軍訓目的有重大之供獻、自不待言、若認步兵之操演爲體育、以之爲軍國民訓練之主要方法、則謬誤敦甚、故本方案除對於軍訓有間接供獻之體育自身的價值外、整個軍訓之各方面、政府另有辦法、無牽及之必要也、</p>
<h3>（二）體育與衛生及健康教育</h3>
<p>一般人因體育之能促進發育及健康、遂常認體育爲衞生之一部、或以衛生爲體育之一部、實則二者各有其範圍不能混而爲一也、從社會方面言之、衛生其爲政府重要職權之一、包含醫藥之供給、環境之改良、疾痛之預防、民衆之衛生訓練與開導等項之設施、從學校方面言之、健康爲教育目的中最重要之一項、包含健康之保護與視察、環境衛之設施、適當之衛生教學等項之設置、健康爲生活之要素、而教育與實際生活有關、舉凡一切學校内之活動與設施均不能無健康教育之意義及成分、體育既屬學校内學科及活動之一、對於健康教育有相當之供獻、體育之必然結果爲促進機體之發育與健康、前己言之、此即其對於健康教育之最大供獻、但除此必然之健康結果外、體育尚有其他對於教育之主要供獻、况體育之組成分子純爲大肌肉活動、健康教育之組成分子所有學校之活動與教育均含有之、故體育與健康教育雖同屬於教育範圍内者、實則大有區别也、本方案只能於體育範圍内立論、不涉及衛生及健康教育也</p>
<h3>（三）體育與勞動</h3>
<p>體育既爲大肌肉之不活動、於是常有人認爲與勞動相彷彿、甚有主張以勞動代體育者、殊不知二者之目的及意義均不相同、勞動之目的爲生産、體育之目的爲教育、勞動之於兒童時有戕賊身體之害、故未成年之兒童不宜勞動、早爲社會學家及教育家所公認、體育爲發育身心之唯一工具、若以有生産之勞動代替兒童之游戲與運動、其剥奪兒童發育與教育之機會未有甚於此者也、勞動爲成人之工作、體育則爲娱樂、工作固爲生活之必要、而適當之娱樂亦爲生活之不可無、况體育所欲逹到之各種教育目標如前所述者、均非勞動之所能逹、故主張以勞動代體育者、實過於崇信工利主義而忽略體育内之各種教育意義也、</p>
<h3>（四）體育與童子軍</h3>
<p>童子軍本爲訓練青年戰争時充當斥候之技能逐漸發展成爲有織織的多方的青年訓練、其主要内容爲予青年與自然界及社會實際接觸之機會、以培養對人對對物之種種生活技能與正當態度、其組織之方法則純爲學校課外活動、一如以學校教室内所學者、於此課外設計中實習之、故童子軍爲一整個教育設計、另逹其特殊之目標、體育不能代童子軍、猶童子軍之不能代體育也、至於童子軍所練習之種種身體活動與技能測騐、固非與體育無關、因其爲整個教育設計、自不能不採取許多體育活動與材料、但此種體育之活動與材料、自應與學校體育課程有相當之聯絡、不待言矣、</p>
<h3>（五）國術在體育上之地位</h3>
<p>國術爲我國民族固有之身體活動方法、一方面可以供給自衛之技能、一方面可作鍛鍊體格之工具、不獨在民族史上有其固定之價值、即從近代科學如解剖生理等方面觀察之亦未可厚非、發揚之研究之、實爲今日之必要、但學術無國界人、類之天性中外無不同、凡不背科學原則及能適合人類天性之種種體育活動、均應按照國内社會狀况一律提倡之、不應以其發源之地點不同而有所軒輊、故國術實爲體育活動之一種、不能因其爲我國所固有者而予以特珠之地位、以捐棄其他合乎科學及教育之體育活動也另一方面言之學術既無國界、則我國之國術固應力謀其在國際間之發展、不應以之爲奇貨可居觀乎日本之柔道近日爲歐美許多人士所學習、况我國國術之奥妙遠在其上乎、至於國内體育家對於國術應加以深切之注意與研究、而國術家應對於近代體育及其基本之學科亦須有相當之認識、此實爲發揚及研究國術之必要途徑、</p>
<h3>二目標</h3>
<p>一·供給國民機體充分平均發育之機會、</p>
<p>二·訓練國民隨機運用身體以適應環境之能力、</p>
<p>三·培養國民合作團結之精神、</p>
<p>四·培養國民俠義勇敢刻苦耐勞之風尚、發揚民族之精神、</p>
<p>五·培養國民以運動及游戲爲娱樂之習慣、</p>
<h3>三行政及設施（一）行政及組織系統</h3>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>秋老虎</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>有虎之名無虎之形有虎之暴無虎之貌的秋老虎，又在這送暑迎凉聲中飛舞而活躍！</p>
<p>老虎二字，是代表兇猛的意思：兇猛的野獸，老虎以上還有獅大哥：不過爲着産生的區域問題，中國人罕見獅子，只害怕着老虎罷了。兇猛的婦人，呌做雌老虎，面貌柔善，而兇在骨子裏的人，呌做笑面老虎：墨榻的碑帖，索價異常狠辣的，呌做黑老虎：尋常的東西，當做奇貨可居的，呌做老虎肉。還有其他種種的無形老虎，不及詳證：總而言之，老虎二字，便是兇猛的代名詞。</p>
<p>秋老虎三字，不問而知，便是形容秋暑酷烈的意思：但意思：但是，盛夏的酷熱，勝於秋暑，爲什麽不喚一聲夏老虎呢？有人説：盛夏酷熱是當然的,不必另立什麽夏老虎的名詞：惟有交了秋季，分明貼着打倒酷暑的標語，人人都希望着金風送暑，玉露迎凉：卻不料秋天的酷熱，比着盛夏，有過之，無不及！大家存着一種失望之心，所以異口同聲，都説：可怕的秋老虎！</p>
<p>其實呢，秋老虎不用怕，怕的是四季的老虎，一方的老虎不用怕，怕的是徧地的老虎！甚麽呌做四季老虎和徧地老虎？這個答案載在檀弓上面，孔二先生説的：苛政猛於虎也！</p>
<p>民衆只求幸免苛政的壓迫，己是感激不盡的了：這局部肆虐的秋老虎，怕它做甚？怕它做甚？</p>
<h3>蘇諺詮釋</h3>
<p>— 飯牛翁</p>
<p>七塔八幢九饅頭蘇城内外共有七塔。如虎邱塔。在閶門外虎邱山。上方塔。在胥門外支硎山。雙塔。在葑門内定慧寺。亦稱雙塔寺。當日科舉時代。吴郡取士試院即在寺右。白塔。在東城内臨頓里。瑞光塔。在盤門内瑞光寺無樑殿之前。明長洲狀元文震孟作記。北寺塔一名報恩塔。在城北。係吴大帝赤烏六年孫權報母恩而建。黃蓋蔣欽丁奉周泰程普等督造。舊有斷碑在草萊中。飯牛於三十年夏爬羅剮刮搜得之。别有記幢。形如小塔而低。磚砌實心不空。父老相傅。古時人道忠厚。路有拾遺。置於幛下。俟失物者自往認取。非己物不妄取也。余庽蘇五十年所見幢僅三處。一在恤孤局前。一在衛道觀。一在濂溪坊巷甫橋頭。其他五幢。知者鮮矣。饅頭非食點也。乃洗澡之浴堂。因建築之屋頂圓。似饅頭頂。故稱之曰饅頭。昔桑葉巷中尚有一家。十年前亦售歸張紳改爲宗祠。九饅無一饅矣。</p>
<p>吴趨坊看會老等閶門内臯伯通橋左。有吴趨坊。爲明才子唐伯虎六如居士舊住處。故伯虎畫幅題欵落吴趨唐寅。坊之北頭。市廛櫛比。蘇州原有三節會。每年</p>
<h3>蔡廷鍇之帽與馬伏魯</h3>
<p>帽與馬平常物也。而蔡廷锴將軍之帽與馬。則物以人名殊值吾輩之記述與讚頌。</p>
<p>蔡將軍自赴閩後。最引人注目者。爲將軍之呢帽帽作鼻烟色敗舊不堪。塵土點點着其上。而將軍則出入必偕。見人並頻揚此敗舊之帽以示答禮。有人怪而詢之。將軍曰。此爲余在淞滬指揮抗日戰争時所戴者。</p>
<p>塵土着其上。有如戰旗之彈痕斑斑。足留一紀念。故不願棄之。亦所以誌不忘耳。論者乃稱其帽與華盛頓之鞋林肯之筆。並稱美談。</p>
<p>蔡將軍除此可珍貴之帽外尚有一馬。亦至足珍貴。馬身驅峥嵘。毛色光潔。蓋一千里駒也滬戰時。曾供將軍之駕御。馳騁於槍林彈雨中。累建奇功。聞此馬得自前歲討閣馮之役。族表抵濟南。與石友三戰。此馬即得自石軍。據云。此馬獨蔡能駕。他人駕之。必狂吼亂躍。論者乃又稱此馬與關壯繆之赤兎先後嫓美焉。</p>
<p>清明。七月望。十月朔。爲上元中元下元三節。是日土穀隍神。廟祝香火司事。必盛飾旗傘。廣招鑼鼓。抬泥像袍笏出城。至虎邱厲壇。主祭無祀孤魂。闔城内外盛會。如交讓王。外安齊王。裏安齊王。周襄王。姜太公。伍子胥。春申君黃歇。痢疾司羅隐。眼目司任昉。小織造部堂蔣子文。水仙王柳毅。校塲土地朱鈞。麗娃鄉駙馬府潘元紹。（潘乃姑蘇王張士誠之愛婿）餘則一府三縣諸神社會共計三十六起。城中士女童叟。必於是日至吴趨坊口守候。吴趨坊乃各盛會必經之路。故曰吴趨坊看會老等。老等者。蘇州人久守之謂也。清末此風漸息。民國二十年來。三節會打倒不聞矣。</p>
<h3>女人和化裝品</h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>一個人用顔色去塗染玫瑰花想使得它更鮮艶些，誰也要笑他是一個傻瓜：但一個很美麗的女人，並不以伊的本來面目示人，却加上一番人工使得伊變得更妖艶些，人們還以爲是理所當當然，説什麽［愛美天性］的話，這裏面也許含着神秘的哲學意味罷。其實結果也不過發展了化裝業和發明了各種新奇的化裝術而己。</p>
<p>一百五十年以前，英國國會曾經議决一案：［凡是女人，無論什麽階級的女人，從此以後必須遵守此條議决案，不得用濃烈的香水，塗脂抺粉，钁假牙，裝假髮，戴環或圈，着高跟鞋，或束腰等人工化裝術增加自己的誘惑力以吸引男人：否則嚴責不貸。］在那時，的確曾經建築了很多新式的監獄給這些漂亮的女人們住。然而，愛妮沙蓓皇后和一般皇親國戚不但違背議决案，並且更奢侈的以法國酒和牛乳洗浴。</p>
<p>像這些紅的胭脂，的的香粉，血似的塗唇膏，染指甲的藥水，洗臉的香皂洒在身上的香水和一切畫眉等等人裝品，從古到今並没有讓女人們失望過，不過眼前更科學化和藝術化罷了。就如普通的香蕉會把它當作香料：羊毛會當作雪花膏之類的原料。總之，製造成一種化裝品，第一，能使女人：無論老太太或小姑娘：全愛用：第二，不損害皮膚，原料得要純粹：第三，準得不時改良它，或者改頭換面的算是一種新發明的，不能讓女人發生厭惡的心理。</p>
<p>有一個化裝品專家説道：［女人化裝以了後，站在鏡子面前，左顧右盼的，總得使自己看上去减輕了歲數和增加誘惑力，伊覺得很美了，從心靈深處覺得是己經巧奪天工了：才願意把經過一番人工製造的伊送到社會上去和别的女人競争。尤其是夜間，在那暗澹的燈光下，或淡汩的月光下，那一般人工美的勁兒，讓你瞧了，眞夠你受的：但，假使你得到了伊的賜予，到明天早晨當你醒的時候，覷着你懷抱中的伊，啊，你究竟領略了些什麽呢？：：虚僞，啊！虚僞！]</p>
<p>女人，可憐的女人，虚僞的女人，這樣的化裝，把你們弄成人工美便是你们的美德麽？不以本來的你們而赢得别人的信仰心便是你們的勝利麽？可是男人們又爲什麽愛外表美的女人。而不注意女人内心的美呢？這，女人之所以愛化裝品如命和以人工美使得自己更嬌艶，更動人，也許是男人們的罪惡。然而，這總是一個不可解的謎：女人和化裝品。</p>
<h3>首都之夜</h3>
<p>— 林裕廬</p>
<p>上海之夜。是那麽繁華。是那麽神秘。首都是新興的都市。雖然没有上海那樣繁華。可是那夜色的神秘。也足夠耐人尋味的了。記者旅居此間月餘。就把這裏的情形。隨你的寫來。在黃昏時分。鼎鼎有名的太平路和夫子廟。這種熱閙的景况。不亞於上海的北四川路和城隍廟。當你獨步於太平路上。那裏有紅緑的［年紅照耀着偌大的廣告。路的兩旁充滿了大商店。百貨雜陳。華燈燦爛。吸此着許多男女顧客。寛大的階沿。有不少的女性會給你看到。裝束較上海爲樣素。雖則看倒也很肉感。確没有上海那樣妖冶。短袖翻領。赤足白鞋。黑色短裙。這是唯一的女學生裝束。幾遍及於全城。</p>
<p>當你站立在夫子廟前。令你會嗅到粉香肉味。雖則南京没有公開或私設的娼妓。可是所謂［賣嘴不賣身］的歌女。很多很多的在茶樓上設台清唱。苦悶的人兒擠在堂。捧場點戲。興高彩烈。至於眞個消魂。當然還有去向。不過爲警局所禁。因此非熟客不得問津。小子聞友人道及如此。旁的恕我不知了。</p>
<p>這座不夜之城裏。納凉的勝地是很多。最令人流連忘返的。要算秦淮河和玄武湖了。從夫子廟的小公園内。僱了一隻畫舫緩緩的向秦淮河中馳去在船上約。你可對酒獨酌。心悶時兒。你可喚個歌女唱幾支曲兒聽聽。秦淮河中有專事賣唱的船隻。每隻船上約有二三歌女不等丨丨並有覽食品的小船時時會來兜攬生意。在河中你還能揩油聽着黃鶑般的歌喉。嬌滴滴地唱着情歌。京調小曲揚州調。可以説應有盡有。雖則是更深夜静。那小小的秦淮河依舊會充滿了畫舫。比奏淮更幽静更廣泛更可愛的清凉界。就是玄武湖了。玄武湖的全部。現在範爲五洲公園·我以爲上海的麗娃栗妲村和虹口公園。也有波光月色。可是都不及這裏的好。大大的面積爲玄武湖割絶了。成爲像島似的五個小洲因此就名公園爲［五洲］啦。這裏修竹叢深。樹蔭濃密·處處顯露出幽静的自然美來。因此騷人雅士們替它題個雅號。呌［處女公園］。在夜色中。玄武更美了。那面也有小的畫舫。可是絶對没有歌女們的足跡。也有自己划漿的小游艇。駕了一葉扃舟蕩漾於玄武中心。丨丨寛大的水面。覺不着畫舫的擁擠丨丨抬頭望明月。低頭照樣也是看明月。微風吹縐了湖面而起漪漣。燈光照耀在水面上。形成光亮而又動遥的一條。兩旁有垂柳的倒影。灣曲的湖道。穿過了小橋。處處有不同的景色。在湖中間或也能聽到［梵啞林］的悠揚。在對岸邊也若窺見一對情侣在小艇上互相擁抱。水上的一副倒影。那情狀會令單身漢羡煞妬煞。如其能一杯在手。那時管教你忘了一切。忘了自己。大有飄飄欲仙之概。你還會想到回去嗎。呀。神秘哉首都之夜。有多少幸福的人們。在你懷抱中做着詩的美夢。</p>

<p>原棉廠需活動多矣</p>
<p>棉市一週以來、日見高峰、形勢挺秀、一般投機家傾向多頭、因海外美棉稳定、金市未見大落、國内新棉尚未有確實把握、於是買方心意大濃、逢跌購買做多、但某廠商猛力抛賣、包額殊巨、探其意見、以今庚雨水調匀、新棉生産狀况豐盛、故對於新棉傾向抛出、雖有大量之售出、都被投機者吸收、所以市氣較昻、至於新棉情形、據中華棉産統計會調查、大約有一千0五十萬担以外、較去年增加四百萬担以外、此項數量、爲民八年以來之大豐收、標語一週以來、成交統計五十萬00六百担、各月價格比前週漲九錢五分、惟八月份以青黃不接之際、交貨者缺乏、獨漲二兩一錢、廠方現棉量較爲活動、美棉比前週漲十五碍音、兹將各廠商買去現棉之額、分列如下、</p>

<h3>修正滬法院恊定問題</h3>
<p>司法院定十月照會各國</p>
<p>日方聯絡各國阻礙進行</p>
<p>本埠公共租界江蘇高等法院第二分院·上海第一特區地方法院·及法租界江蘇高等法院第三分院·上海第二特區地方法院之恊定、均將於明年四月前期滿·司法行政部、現己準備向領事團方面、接洽修正事宜、并定十月間照會各國、同時開會議討論、昨得詳情如下、</p>
<p>先期照會各國據司法界某當局談、對於修正恊定事宜、外交部方面、或將於十月前照會各國、因按之該恊定規定、凡恊定期滿經雙方同意、得延長其期限三年、如須届時修正者、則應於期滿半年前、由一方先行照會各方、然後得以修正、蓋能於半年内作修正上種種之準備也、</p>
<p>法院建議呈部據高等法院第二分院書記官長張大椿語新聲社記者云、司法行政部修正恊定、雖與本院本身有關係、然本院方面、并未參加、因此係外交上之問題、惟本院爲貢獻司法行政部起見、業己將收回後辦理之經過·及種種應改良之點、一一呈報部中、以供將來修正時之根據云、</p>
<p>將來交涉趨勢記者嗣又從他方面探悉、該四法院之恊定、雖在進行修正、然其進行之順利與否、尚須視政治爲轉移、在目下政局未定之際、對於此事之進行、實有極大之困難、而外人又易利用此點、加以阻礙云、</p>
<p>日方蓄意作梗日本方面、因修正恊定、將使我國對於特區各法院之權利擴大、如司法警察權·檢察權·之收回、外籍律師辯護權之取消、故蓄意破壞、滬戰之後、日方曾宣稱滬戰係法院所造成者、而竟引起一般外人之誤信、最近日又聞有秘密向各國聯絡、阻礙我法院修正之説、記者復以此詢問高等法院二分院推事郭懷璞、郭作非正式表示、謂一切事物、均須依照自然之趨勢而行、如本法院與特區法院、於會審公廨時代、盡爲外人之勢力、後收回改組爲臨時法院、遂有一大部分權入我國掌握中、迨臨時法院再改特區法院、又被我方收回一部份權利然則此次修改恊定、當然依法再行收回各種應有之權利、而决無開倒車、使特區法院形成更畸形之地位云、</p>

<p>言</p>
<h3>對於報告諸君報告兩件事並答復幾句</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>今天鄙人要對諸君説幾句話，在未説之前，己感覺了百二十分的抱歉，因爲本刋自改組以來，蒙諸君熱心愛護，紛紛投稿，使本刋在社會上得到不少的佳評，都是諸君愛護本刋，熱血精心結搆的成績，所最抱仄的，本刋篇幅有限，而每日投稿之信，平均總有三四十封之多，即有傑作佳文，每因積壓過多，一時亦無從披露，使諸君精心結撰的佳作,等於付諸東洋大海，這何等不安的事呢，而三次登報公告，暫緩惠投，未獲原諒，仍踵相接，於此蓋見諸君愛護本刋之深，令人悚惶無地者也，兹有兩件瑣事，報告並答復如左。</p>
<p>一，改良社會文，應有系統的記載，曾有某君哪此要求，此事鄙人編輯之初，亦是如此，但各方惠來稿件，問題既屬複雜，而所接的信，又不在一時，若使一個問題，討論終結，再登其他問題，無論天天登載同一問題，幾令閲者生厭，並且問題有容易解决者，亦有不容易解决者，其中亦有許多困難情形，譬如政府召集開一大會，或各團體開一大會，事先徵求各會員意見，嗣將各種提案，作有系統的統製後，再交大會討論，本刋的討論改育問題，萬不能這樣手續，這是一件困難的事，</p>
<p>一·投稿諸君，往往有如不登載，乞將原稿寄還等要求，但本刋投稿之多，既如前述，今日不能登出，明日又繼續增加，如此一批一批積壓下來，即要將原稿奉還，己如大海撈針，無從尋覓，即如改良社會問題一項，現己積存稿件，至百餘封之多，實在無從整理，最好兩請諸君暫緩發稿，以清積件，以後諸君如有不用索還之件，請不必見寄，此種苦衷，亦祈原諒，譬如某君寄來一稿，如該稿性質，絶對不能用，即便奉還，倒也爽快，但看該稿，尚有一登價值，不得不暫爲存留，俟機披露，豈知一櫊下來，就無翻身之日，此種困難情形，不得不爲諸君告也</p>
<p>一·本刋投稿諸君，大抵係學堂青年居多，然亦有中途失學者，或公司中職員，亦不乏其人，故諸君中每有不以自滿，或來書願執弟子禮者，或請介紹函授學校，擬作進一步之研究者，此種情形，殊堪憐憫，但　陋如余，天然没有爲人師的資格，而欲爲諸君介紹，亦是一件困難的事，因爲鄙人對於各界，素少接洽，上海函授學堂，共有多少，何者爲善，何者爲劣，均屬茫然，此又不能壓諸君所要求者此也</p>

<h3>近代的新式滅火器</h3>
<p>— 白洪</p>
<p>大都市中，時常有火災發生，爲防備萬一起見，各大公司以及各工廠中近來都有一種新式滅火器。這種滅火器系一密封着的圓柱形的金屬罐，罐中藏着滅火的藥品。用時極便，只須將罐倒轉頭來，在地板上用力一擊，或扭動罐頂的螺旋，管内立刻便會噴出一種氣體來，這氣體射到之處，火即熄滅，爲效極鉅。説起這東西的造法來却異常簡單，祇不過是一隻簡單的二氣化碳發生器耳　二氣化碳，俗呌碳酸氣，是一種不能助燃的氣體。我們知道空氣裏有一種氣氣，是一種能帮助燃燒的氣體，火遇之即發强烈的燃燒。但一旦遇着碳酸氣把火包圍起來，使與空氣中的氧氣隔絶，火立即熄滅。你可以用下面的方法，來做一隻簡單的滅火器試試看：</p>
<p>用一隻大的廣口瓶和一隻水瓶（這瓶要能放入大瓶中才行）：一些重碳酸鈉（即小蘇打）：一些鹽酸或硫酸：一根上等金屬線：一技尖頭玻璃管：一隻橡皮塞。現在，你把大瓶裏悵滿三分之一的重碳酸鈉。把小瓶裏裝滿鹽酸或硫酸，然後用金屬絲將小瓶緊起來，懸入大瓶中，但不能將小瓶的口没入重碳酸鈉中，防止重碳酸鈉和鹽酸混合。此刻你把懸小瓶的金屬線掛在大瓶口上，用橡皮塞緊緊的將大瓶口塞牢。橡皮塞中央有一孔，孔中插入尖頭玻璃管。插入瓶中之管長。以瓶倒轉時不至被鹽酸和重碳酸鈉所淹没爲妙。這隻簡單的滅火器就這樣成功了。你燃起一根火柴或燭來，將瓶一個翻身，使鹽酸與重碳酸鈉相混合。將火放到尖頭玻璃管的口上去看，管裏冒出氣來，火遇着這氣體立刻熄掉了。原來，這時候鹽酸與重碳酸　相混合，發生化學作用，放出多量的碳酸氣來，將火滅掉了。眞的新多滅火器，牠的内部構造，完全和這相同。就是應用這兩種藥品相合時，發生一酸氣造出來的。這種滅火器對於油酒之類發生火災時，救滅最有效。因爲這些流質發生燃燒時，不是水所能滅得掉的。</p>
<p>滅火器應該放在家庭中最便當的地方，而且必須學習牠的用法。到十分危急時，就不至於心惶撩亂，無所措手足了。在施用的時候，應該將這氣體射往火上面，因爲牠比空氣重。也不能呼吸這種氣體。</p>
<p>萬一不幸爲火所包圍，不必着惶，認清樓梯的位置和逃避的路，倘若能夠的話，最好把衣服弄濕，覆在口鼻上呼吸，然後在地板上爬行。咸者用繩縛住床，拉住繩從窗户裏逃出來。如果你非從高樓上跳下來不可的時候，那末，先抛下被褥地毯等，人再跳在上面，危險此較少些。</p>
<p>當心你家裏的火，一切災難都可以免掉，而且一切滅火器都不必需要了。</p>

<h3>關於男女平等問題</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>讀了振君的男女平等問題，固如振君所謂［還是一個懸案，並未解决·］但讀了祖娥女士（我認定她是女士）的答復振君的男女平等問題，却尤使我發生更甚於此的感想，爰敢不揣冒昧，略抒鄙見，以蘄此問題的相當認識，</p>
<p>我根本覺得二君的宏論，都只涉及一些枝節，皮相，不曾抓住骨幹，易言之，即是二君都犯了大前提的差誤，所以演繹下來的結論，也便糢糊，使人摸不着究竟，打開歷史來看，眞正男女平等的史蹟，恐只有在最原始的共産社會，（漁獵時代）男女在極開塞的環境中，作同樣極簡單的工作，以滿足其極樸質的生活，才算眞正平等，其後因掠奪與單争的結果，漸漸形成私有制度，女人因受生理及其他環境之支配，不如男子强梁，於是女人硬被擠出了平等水綫，在封建社會裏，女人是男子的附屬品！</p>
<p>奴隸，那是無疑義的事實，即在資本主義的現社會裏，大體説，女人仍是男子的附屬品·玩物：但同時亦可找出男供女玩的事實來，這是畸形社會的畸形現象：其或己有少數男女躋於平等，那到底是最少數，試問在法律上，女人尚無澈底的平等待遇，又無經濟甚礎，還有社會倫理，習慣法等的束縛，怎能使女人走上生活平等？故據鄙見，要男女眞正平等，須至未來的新社會，才能談到至於説女人的會寫［親愛的哥哥］，［Kissme］［oveyou］，男子的穿着挺直的服裝，梳得滑光的頭髮，痴心拜倒到旗衫之下，這並不能説是玩物的行爲，而是愛戀異性的表現，就是到了未來的新社會裏，此種行爲，恐不但不會消滅，且會更盛吧。</p>
<p>至娥女士説［：：：］一切權利義務己分不出男女了：：己臻至男女平等的地位·］這不知她怎樣在開口，恐不免戴了有色眼鏡吧？又説：：［只要我們誠心：：隨時隨地解决了男女平等的問題，：：視女仍舊［女人是女人］如此説來，：：實現終究不此實現了·］如此説來，男女平等，竟是一個誠心，觀念的問題了，眞未免滑天下之大稽，其餘娥女士的錯誤，因爲篇幅所限，恕不一一指説總之：男女眞正的平等，全基礎於經濟條件，而經濟條件，復與社會制度相關聯，女人在現社會的經濟基礎之下，欲想與男人眞正平等，那是不可能的難事，充其量亦只有至少數可以談到，我是與張娥二君都不相識，所言自認公正，質之二君及諸位會員先生以爲可如</p>

<p>— 友如</p>

<p>：什麽？你講底什麽？在這極不景氣底家庭狀况之下，我勸你别儘説這等使人驚心動魄底説話：］夫茫然地回答。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Launch Surprise Attack on Jehol</h3>
<p>The Japanese ambition to seize Jehol has long been as obvious as Sima Zhao's intentions to everyone. The previous bombing of Chaoyang was a concrete action in preparation for the invasion of Jehol. The reason for its sudden cessation was solely due to the constraint imposed by our Volunteer Army in the rear. Some say that because of the Volunteer Army's constraint, the Japanese, though viewing the political turmoil of Wang Jingwei and Zhang Xueliang's resignations as a good opportunity to launch an invasion of Jehol, did not dare act rashly. Our countrymen, seeing that the Japanese did not launch an attack at this opportune moment, became complacent, believing that it would take the Japanese a considerable amount of time to sweep away our Volunteer Army. Therefore, they thought that the violent act of invading Jehol and eyeing Tianjin and Beiping would occur at least after the end of winter and the beginning of spring. Consequently, their vigilance waned, their defense preparations slackened, and their courage to rise up and resist Japan diminished daily. Alas, if that is the case, our countrymen's dream will never come to an end.</p>
<p>The Japanese annexation of Manchuria and Mongolia is their entire plan. To connect with Outer Mongolia, they must have Jehol. Therefore, their ambition to seize Jehol is what they crave day and night. How could they be slightly deterred by the constraint of the Volunteer Army? The timing of their launch also depends on the arrangement of various aspects and not on a temporary victory or defeat. A few days ago, it was reported that the plenary power of Mutō had been announced in the North, and military actions on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line were immediately launched. Thus, the Japanese invasion of Jehol has long been a predetermined step. If there is an opportunity, how could they sit idly by and lose it? Today, the Japanese army has indeed launched a surprise attack, breaking into Jehol from Yixian and Chaoyangsi, and heading straight for Beiyingzi and Nanling. According to Tang Yulin's telegram, Nanling has fallen, and our troops have retreated to Beiyingzi. Judging from their actions, it is not like the previous excuse of the Ishimoto incident, merely using the bombing of Chaoyang as a test. The nature of the danger and seriousness can be seen from the domestic urgent telegrams.</p>
<h3>War Has Broken Out on the Jehol Border Japanese Armored Trains Rush into Jehol Territory Fierce Battles Erupt Over Chaoyang and Nanling Front Lines Extend to Koubei and Beiyingzi Japanese Aircraft Bomb the Jehol Border, Buildings Destroyed</h3>
<p>Prior to the Shanhaiguan incident, the Japanese army attacked Jehol, deeply fearing that the Liaoxi Volunteer Army would follow in its wake, and therefore did not dare to take active action. Recently, because the Volunteer Army suffered setbacks in its previous attacks on Jinzhou and Shenyang, its morale was temporarily depressed and has not yet recovered. Therefore, starting from the 18th, it resolutely turned from defense to offense. The Jinzhou Japanese army dispatched large forces to move towards the Jehol border in an attempt to seize Chaoyang as a base. At the same time, it adopted a large encirclement strategy against the Liaoxi Volunteer Army. It is expected that there will be significant developments on the Jehol border in the short term. This afternoon, Japanese armored trains continued to attack Nanling fiercely, and armored vehicles attacked Koubei Beiyingzi. Our Dong Brigade is doing its best to resist with high morale. In the morning, three Japanese aircraft flew over Chaoyang to threaten and spread leaflets, telling our garrison to withdraw from Chaoyang to avoid causing suffering to the local people. The Japanese army in Suizhong has recently been actively rebuilding a large airfield. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Official news from the Beiping office: The Jehol Provincial Government sent an urgent telegram to Beiping overnight yesterday, stating that on the 20th, the Jinzhou Japanese army sent many armored vehicles as vanguards to rush into Jehol territory from Yixian and Chaoyangsi, engaging in fierce clashes with our Dong Brigade stationed in Nanling. The front line extended to the Koubei Beiyingzi area. When the telegram was sent in the evening, they were still clashing. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Tang Yulin's telegram from Beiping to Beiping stated: 1. Japanese armored vehicles drove to Pomiaozi and opened fire on our side, which is currently resisting. 2. On the 19th at noon, Japanese aircraft scattered leaflets in Chaoyang, spreading rumors and warning the Volunteer Army to return home. 3. On the evening of the 19th, Japanese armored vehicles went to Nanling and made contact with our side. Subsequently, our team in Nanling retreated to Koubei Beiyingzi to concentrate. Chaoyang is more than a hundred li from Koubei Beiyingzi, making reinforcements difficult. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th, seven Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on the border between Jinzhou and Jehol. All buildings, villages, and large trees were destroyed. They also scattered leaflets containing absurd words such as "Anyone who conspires with the Volunteer Army to resist the Japanese army will be killed without pardon." Residents were panicked and fled. Furthermore, at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 20th, Japanese aircraft bombed our military base, station, and post office in Nanling, all of which were damaged. Li Zanting, Chief of Staff of the Jehol Garrison in Beiping, and Meng Zhaotian, Military Representative, will request a meeting of various generals to discuss countermeasures due to the emergency of the Jehol military situation. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>The Jinzhou Japanese army and the Jehol army opened fire between Chaoyangsi and Nanling. The Japanese army received support from Suzuki's unit from Chaoyangsi. After several hours of fierce fighting, they defeated the Jehol army and occupied Nanling at 9 PM yesterday. (Telegraph from the 21st)</p>
<p>Regarding the Ishimoto incident rescue, the Kwantung Army is taking a calm attitude and has entrusted the Jinzhou troops to handle it. The Jinzhou troops are taking a cautious approach. Regarding the shooting incident by the Jehol army on the 19th, they intend to resolve it locally. Furthermore, because Tang Yulin's attitude is unclear, they have issued warnings regarding the Ishimoto issue and the Volunteer Army issue within Jehol, all of which were conveyed by Councilor Zhang, demanding a sincere response from Tang Yulin. Depending on the response, they will begin appropriate action. (Telegraph from the 21st)</p>
<p>According to today's Chinese newspaper in Beiping, Japanese aircraft have recently repeatedly dropped incendiary bombs north of Yuguan, resulting in the burning of several Chinese villages. However, the farmers were notified in advance when the Japanese aircraft came to bomb and fled into the sorghum fields and graves, so there were not many casualties. After the Japanese aircraft flew back, these homeless farmers fled into the pass in large numbers. (Reuters telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo According to a telegram from Beiping, at 4 AM this morning, Tang Yulin sent an urgent telegram to Zhang Xueliang, stating that on the 20th, the Japanese army in Jinzhou, led by armored vehicles, invaded Jehol Province from Yizhou Chaoyangsi, engaging in a clash with the Jehol army. The front line extended and developed to near Beipiao, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. (Telegraphic News Agency telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>Beiping Feng Yong returned to Beiping from Jehol today and went to Kailu for reconnaissance. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>The Lushan Conference Proceeded Well</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, Song Ziwen, and others returned to Nanjing by plane yesterday.</p>
<p>Two plans are proposed regarding the issue of the President of the Executive Yuan: resignation and retention.</p>
<p>The Central Standing Committee's extraordinary meeting today will combine and discuss to make a final decision.</p>
<p>It is expected that Wang will remain until the Third Plenary Session, when it will be resolved.</p>
<p>Nanjing Wang Jingwei and six others descended the mountain at 8 AM on the 21st and arrived in Jiujiang at 11 AM. He Yingqin transferred to Nanchang. Wang, accompanied by Song Ziwen, Zhu Peide, Wu Jingheng, Zeng Zhongming, and Song's attendant Huang Chun, flew to Nanjing from Xuncheng at 12 PM. After receiving the telegram in Nanjing, Chu Minyi, Wang and Song's attendants, and guards went to the former palace airfield to welcome them. At 2:30 PM, the plane arrived, circled the city twice, and landed. After Wang and others got off the plane, Chu Minyi took a photo. They then returned to their private residences by car. Chen Bijun reportedly remained in Lushan for a few days to rest due to illness before returning. Wang talked about meeting Lin Sen and Jiang Jieshi in Lushan and reported the original reasons for this resignation, requesting that they be sincere and agree to his request. Lin and Jiang both encouraged him to take responsibility. After four days of consultation, the results of the plan were determined, brought to Nanjing, and will be submitted to the Central Extraordinary Standing Committee for discussion on the 21st. One is what he proposed. Regarding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, he resolutely requested his resignation. In order to cope with the seriousness of the national crisis, he is willing to continue serving in the Executive Yuan, shoulder a part of the President's duties, and assist his colleagues in the Executive Yuan in governing the country. The second is what Lin and Jiang proposed, roughly meaning that his resignation is when foreign aggression and internal troubles are serious. It is not advisable to change the central administrative leadership. In any case, it is necessary to temporarily maintain the difficult situation and cope with the national crisis. The issue of resignation can be submitted to the Third Plenary Session for discussion and a decision by the General Assembly. Therefore, his stay or departure will be the final decision of the Central Standing Committee tomorrow. Regarding the general resignation of the ministers of the Executive Yuan, after the issue of the President is decided, it is expected that there will be no changes in the heads of the various ministries and commissions. Or, one or two ministers may have resigned several times before his resignation, and it will also be up to the Central Committee to discuss and decide. In short, the stay or departure of internal personal actions is irrelevant to the overall plan to the outside world. The government's anti-Japanese proposition remains unchanged. Wu Jingheng said that the results of the Lushan Conference were very impressive. When President Wang met with Mr. Lin and Jiang, he expressed</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>a firm resignation and was unwilling to continue. Lin and Jiang repeatedly and sincerely comforted and retained him, treated each other with sincerity, expressed their feelings, and encouraged each other with national affairs. After two talks, Mr. Wang's persistent attitude changed a lot. Today, everyone is willing to regard the rise and fall of the country and the survival of the nation as their own responsibility, so there is no need to talk about anything. Everyone in Lushan requested President Wang to resume his post, believing that today's responsibility is entrusted to the President and no other. The result of the talks was to decide on two principles and submit them to the Central Committee for discussion. Mr. Wang is a comrade in our party who is brave in taking responsibility, or he may no longer speak of resignation and resume his post. Although this trip to Lushan was only three days, there were six or seven talks, and I participated in five of them. In the first three times, we discussed the issue of President Wang's resumption of his post. In the remaining two times, although we briefly discussed issues such as bandit suppression and diplomacy, because we had already formulated a bandit suppression plan and diplomatic policy, there was not much discussion on this item, but just a casual talk. The Huaibei generals issued a telegram to retain Zhang Xueliang, which is a procedure for Chinese military and political figures to take office and resign, and their subordinates to respond. All kinds of rumors are speculation. As for the chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Jiang Jieshi also did not send a telegram to Zhang to act as an agent. Because Jiang is suppressing bandits in three provinces, progress is being made, and it is temporarily difficult to go north. The red bandits in the three provinces can be eliminated in the short term, but their party has a relatively large influence in our country and must be cleaned up for ten or eight years. Mr. Jiang took a plane back to Wuhan at 2 PM on the 21st. I originally planned to return to Nanjing tomorrow, but because Song had something to do, I returned to Nanjing on the same plane today. Song Ziwen said that the results of this trip to Lushan were satisfactory. The contents are not fully known because the factors have not fully participated in the talks. I am in a hurry to return to Nanjing because there is an important matter in Shanghai, and I plan to fly to Shanghai on the 22nd. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>The Nanjing Central Standing Committee is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting on the morning of the 22nd. Wang Zhaoming, Wu Jingheng, and others will attend and report on the situation of the Lushan Conference. At the same time, Wang will propose a resignation case, and Jiang will propose a retention case to be combined and discussed to make a final decision. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Nanjing According to information from the Shishi News Agency, Ironworks Director Gu Mengyu expressed to people that he has not achieved any results since taking office and is determined to leave to make way for the virtuous. Even if Wang agrees to resume his post, he will never do it again. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Today, the Central Committee members in Nanchang all left Lushan, Jiang returned to Wuhan, Wang set out to return to Nanjing, and the plane took off early in the morning. It may be done in the afternoon. The Lushan meeting decided to retain Wang, and it is uncertain whether Wang will resume his post. There are new decisions on anti-Japanese military affairs, diplomacy, and finance, which will be submitted to the Central Committee for implementation. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Nanjing Wang Jingwei, Song Ziwen, Zhu Peide, and Wu Zhihui arrived in Nanjing by plane today after a three-day meeting with Chairman Lin and Military Affairs Commission Chairman Jiang in Guling. According to political sources here, the results of the Guling meeting were quite satisfactory. The details have not yet been officially announced, but it is heard that the main result of the discussion is that Wang Jingwei has actually agreed to Chairman Jiang's request to temporarily remain in office until the Third Plenary Session is convened. It is now believed that when the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee here meets tomorrow, it will submit this proposal for Wang to formally accept. He Yingqin also participated in the Guling meeting and has not yet returned to Nanjing, but has gone to Nanchang to inspect the Communist suppression war. (Reuters telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>Nanjing A Reuters interviewer met with Wang Jingwei tonight. According to reports, because the country is currently in distress and after the leaders have made great efforts to retain him, he has agreed to remain in office temporarily. However, Wang has not made any definite statement about withdrawing his resignation, intending to retire as soon as the Third Plenary Session decides on a successor. The political circles here are very satisfied with the results of the Guling meeting, because it is inconvenient to reorganize the government at this time. It is now believed that the government will convene the Third Plenary Session in mid-September to resolve various political issues, and the selection of a successor to the President of the Executive Yuan is one of them. It is heard that Military Affairs Commission Chairman Jiang has left Guling and returned to Wuhan, and will not go elsewhere for the time being. (Reuters telegram on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Speaks to the Generals</h3>

<p>Hope to Take National Interests and People's Welfare as a Prerequisite</p>
<p>Yu Song's Inauguration Date is Undecided</p>
<p>Zhang will Move to the Summer Palace Within Days</p>
<p>Beiping Zhang Xueliang issued another speech to the generals today, saying that his resignation was entirely for the sake of the overall situation of the country. Thinking with sincerity, he said that if he travels to Europe and the United States to study politics and increase his personal knowledge, it will be for the use of the country in the future. Speaking privately, we are all good friends. Although I resign as Director, I still cannot abandon the feelings of friends. Wherever the country needs me, I will do my best for it. Everyone's telegrams to retain me are extremely touching, but my resignation to resolve military power is precisely to love the country and show the personality of a soldier. I hope that everyone will recognize national interests and people's welfare as a prerequisite and do it practically. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

Now that Zhang has resigned, the Pacification Headquarters has also been ordered to close. Therefore, all the Secretariat and all the office staff moved out of the Shuncheng Prince's Mansion on the 20th and went to the Pacification Headquarters to handle the closure. As for Zhang's prepared residence in the Summer Palace, it was also cleaned up yesterday. A part of the daily furniture has been moved from the Shuncheng Prince's Mansion in succession.

<h3>German Parties Negotiating to Form a Prussian State Government</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 20th. Negotiations between the Centre Party and the National Socialist Party to form a Prussian state government will begin on Tuesday. On the 11th of this month, two Centre Party members of parliament, Joss and Bowers, met with Chancellor Papen to explain the Centre Party's policy of establishing a cabinet with a parliamentary coalition, to provide a strong guarantee of adhering to the rule of law. The party's current policy remains unchanged, so negotiations between the two parties to form a Prussian government are proving difficult. It is widely rumoured that former Prussian Prime Minister Braun has had lengthy talks with Defence Minister General Schleicher, saying that even if the cabinet is presidential, it must be based on parliamentary rules. The Centre Party still advocates that the National Socialist Party and the Centre Party jointly join the government, but the Speaker of the Prussian State Parliament, the National Socialist Party member Kerr, recently returned from Sengcheng with instructions from the party, and as a result, the above-mentioned method may not be put into practice. The National Socialist Party's mouthpiece insists that the party will demand the posts of Prussian Prime Minister, Interior, Finance, and Justice. If so, even after the Centre Party and the National Socialist Party cooperate, they will still not be able to obtain real power and will inevitably be fooled.</p>
<h3>Lancashire Cotton Industry Strike Developments</h3>

<h3>German Government Willing to Negotiate Disarmament Issues with Britain and France</h3>
<p>Germany's Hopeful Conditions</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 20th. Some reports claim that the German government is discussing the issue of comprehensive disarmament, especially the parts related to Germany, with the governments of Britain and France in Geneva. In addition to Britain and France, it also wants to discuss with the Italian government. Most military and political figures here comment that this move may be a kind of mortgage made by Chancellor Papen to the Nationalist Party and the National Socialist Party before the opening of the House of Representatives. To avoid this kind of interpretation as much as possible, informed sources claim that this matter is not a new negotiation, but a rehash of the talks that were intended to be conducted in Geneva before. What the Germans hope for in Geneva is to conduct talks on the comprehensive disarmament issue, especially those related to Germany. The Treaty of Versailles has various restrictions on German military affairs, while other countries are not subject to any restrictions. This time, Germany intends to discuss these clauses. Military figures say that what Germany wants to obtain is (1) the right to enjoy and experiment with all new-style military equipment that other countries already have; (2) reducing the term of service in the German army from twelve years to six or four years without requiring an increase in the number of troops. The current priority is to increase the number of officers by two to three times. As for ordinary soldiers, they can be supplied by physical education groups that implement military training, without the need for other means.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 20th. Germany intends to ask the European countries directly concerned to discuss Germany's equal rights and the reorganization of the national defense forces with Germany before the disarmament conference is reconvened. This news has aroused fierce resistance from the Parisian press, and the authorities are therefore quite uneasy. People close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are trying to reduce the importance of this negotiation, saying that the new German lower house will open soon, and there are extremely urgent economic and social problems that need to be solved, so the German government is not eager to solve these foreign policy issues. However, it is also particularly said that Britain and France must conduct negotiations on the level of equality of rights. It is also said that this matter was already started in Geneva, so that the German representatives believed that France would never refuse this consultation. Germany's views on this matter have been explained repeatedly by members of the German cabinet, and General Schleicher's statement is particularly important, so it is very clear what Germany's opinion is. As for what method and when to conduct negotiations with Germany, it is a matter of diplomatic strategy, which must be determined by observing the situation in all aspects, and the attitude of French public opinion is naturally one of the most important points to be noted. The German Foreign Ministry is paying close attention to the criticisms of the French press for this reason. In addition, there is another point that we should pay attention to, that is, the country's demands are originally based on national honor. Since a few weeks ago, there have been domestic political issues mixed in with it. The Germans claim that if Germany can expand its national defense forces from 100,000 to 300,000, then half of the Nazi stormtroopers can be immediately incorporated into the formal army, and the remainder can be eliminated by the compulsory work system. The Germans also said that [the members of the Nazi stormtroopers are determined to be soldiers. If they are incorporated into the formal army, then after two months, these people will surely forget Hitler and serve the Federation faithfully.] This kind of argument is of course very alarming, but those who advocate this theory are close to the government, and this is of great interest.</p>
<h3>Closing of the British Empire Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Twelve Imperial Agreements Signed</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 20th. The closing plenary session of the British Empire Economic Conference was held in the House of Commons at half past ten this morning. The atmosphere in the venue was filled with satisfaction and fatigue. Last night's meeting slightly modified several agreements. Representatives and staff were busy all night. When the General Assembly opened today, there were no empty seats in the side halls. All the representatives, advisers and experts were present. Canadian Prime Minister Bennett entered the venue on time and proposed to pay tribute to the British Emperor. The South African Minister of Finance seconded the motion. After the declaration of allegiance, the report of the First Committee was put to a vote and passed without discussion. Then the representatives signed the agreements. The first agreement to be signed was the British-Australian Agreement, followed by the British Agreements with New Zealand, India, Newfoundland, Rhodesia, and Canada. Finally, agreements between the various autonomous regions were also signed one after another. After the signing was completed, Bennett presented Baldwin with a silver plate as a birthday gift. The plate was engraved with the handwritten names of the representatives. Baldwin gave a speech to thank him, and then proposed to thank the chairman, committees, and staff in general. This proposal was unanimously passed. Baldwin then presented Bennett with a silver plate as a memento. Bennett thanked him and said that the various agreements could increase the mutual benefits of the various parts of the Empire and occupy a considerable position in the economic world. A total of twelve Imperial Agreements were signed today, seven of which were signed by the United Kingdom, including one with South Africa, which was signed after the British-Australian Agreement. The remaining agreements were concluded between Canada and South African Republic, Canada and the Irish Free State, Canada and Rhodesia, South Africa and New Zealand, South Africa and the Irish Free State. The British-Indian agreement stipulates that Indian goods will receive a preferential treatment of 10 percent, which will increase the tax rate on certain foreign goods in order to increase the preferential treatment enjoyed by India. The exemption from taxes for Indian cast iron and semi-finished steel shipped to the UK will be discussed in London at a later date. Foreign flaxseed will be taxed at 10 percent to give preferential treatment to Indian flaxseed. India will give preferential treatment of 7 percent to certain automobiles and other products. When the Indian Tariff Board's recommendations on textiles are decided, preferential treatment of 10 percent will be given to cotton and silk textiles. However, rayon and silk textiles may be subject to protective taxes. All colonies will allow India to enjoy the full benefits of their preferential tax rates, and India will also allow the main products exported by the colonies to enjoy preferential treatment, except for sugar. Labour Party representative Lansbury spoke out against the Ottawa policy, saying that whenever elections are held, the Labour Party will try to free the British people from the economic constraints imposed by the Ottawa Conference. In order to avoid monopolies, the details of each agreement must be published upon ratification. It is heard that the representatives are deeply gratified that this conference was able to resolve the complex issues involving many interests one by one. It is believed that the agreements will meet the principles enumerated by Baldwin at the opening of the conference. Baldwin said at the time that although the Empire is large, it cannot be regarded as complete if it abandons the rest of the world. The success of the conference should be sought in terms of tax reduction, and tax increases are secondary.</p>
<p>After finishing his speech, Canadian Prime Minister Bennett announced the British Emperor's telegram of congratulations on the success of the conference, expressing his satisfaction as at the beginning. He then rose again to announce the historic British Empire Conference was immediately closed, and the representatives bid each other farewell and left the venue. The British and Indian representatives rushed to the special train to Quebec, and from there took a ship back home.</p>
<h3>Professor Piccard Arrives in Venice</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Venice, 21st. Professor Piccard and his wife arrived here today in a plane piloted by Italian Aviation Minister Balbo, staying for a day. When Piccard left the plane, he was greatly welcomed by the crowd. The minister then drove Piccard and his wife through the Grand Canal. As soon as passers-by saw them, they knew that the car was carrying a great scientist, and Piccard was warmly cheered and respected. Also arriving here with Piccard were three planes carrying journalists from Italy and Switzerland. Before Piccard departed, someone who produced a sound film in the United States asked Piccard to say a few words in English to make a film. Piccard replied that he was Swiss and was willing to make a short speech in German with a Swiss accent. He then made a speech praising the strange and astonishing scenery of the stratosphere.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Desenzano, 20th. Italian Aviation Minister Balbo took time out from inspecting naval and air force exercises to personally fly a naval plane here to welcome Belgian Professor Piccard. Italian poet, patriot, soldier, and Weng Dadannuo, who lives in seclusion in the Victory Villa by Lake Garda and has not come out for many years, has also sent a telegram saying that he will come here to congratulate Professor Piccard on his success in exploring the stratosphere and write a poem to celebrate it. Havas, Belgian capital, 20th. The professor's assistant, Cousins, has returned to Brussels by plane. Cousins confirmed that some instruments, such as thermometers, were shattered when the balloon landed, but this shattering was expected, so it had nothing to do with the research. Cousins said that they suffered from severe cold and stayed at an altitude of 16,000 meters for several hours. The results of the aerial observations will take some time to study. Cousins is not yet able to know the details. Professor Piccard sent out radio signals with a wavelength of 40 meters in the air, which were clearly audible. According to Cousins' estimates, this balloon ascent was 400 meters higher than the previous one.</p>
<h3>Five-Nation Aircraft Circuit of Europe Race</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 20th. Forty-one light aircraft from Germany, France, Italy, Poland, and Czechoslovakia will depart from the Tempelhof Airfield outside Berlin at 7:00 tomorrow morning for the Circuit of Europe race. All technical tests have been held at the Stargen Airfield near Berlin for a week and will be completed this afternoon.

The main race will require flying 4,600 miles, from the 11th to the 27th, a total of three legs. The second leg requires a day of rest.

If the champion of this edition is still Motzek, or another German aviator, the trophy awarded by the International Aviation Association can be permanently retained by the German Aviation Club. Of the forty-one aviators participating this time, the Germans account for fifteen and the other twenty-six are from other countries, with the aviators from Italy and Poland being particularly strong opponents of the Germans. There is only one female aviator, Ms. Spanner from England, but because England did not join the competition, she represents the Italian Aviation Club and hangs the Italian flag. As for the German female aviator Bayernhoin, she lent her plane to Motzek and did not participate.</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei Meet in Lushan</h3>
<p>Discussing National Affairs with Chairman Lin and Central Committee Members</p>
<p>He Yingqin to Return to Province Soon to Command Anti-Communist Operations</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: It is reported that prior to his westward journey from Nanjing to oversee the anti-communist operations, Chairman Chiang convened a conference of the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan in Lushan to discuss anti-banditry. Subsequently, Chairman Lin traveled from Nanjing to Lushan to escape the summer heat and recuperate. Chiang also went to Lushan for a brief respite from the intense heat in Hankou. Wang Jingwei, Song Ziwen, Luo Wengan, and others also traveled from Nanjing to Lushan to discuss foreign affairs, military matters, finance, and all issues related to resisting Japan. Since then, important figures of the party and state have visited Lushan, adding to its splendor. Wang Jingwei resigned due to Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance policy, causing a loss of focus in both domestic and foreign affairs. Taking advantage of Chairman Lin's presence in Lushan, Chairman Chiang repeatedly telegraphed Wang, urging him to come to Lushan for discussions to dissuade him from resigning. With the mediation of various Central Committee members, Wang finally agreed to return to Nanjing via Lushan to discuss with Lin and Chiang the selection of a successor after his resignation, and to resolve all important issues currently facing the central government. Chiang flew from Hankou to Xunyang at 5:00 PM on the 15th and then ascended Lushan to meet with Lin. He immediately telegraphed Wang to urge his arrival, and also invited Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, and others to attend a meeting to exchange views. According to the General Headquarters for Anti-Banditry Operations in the border areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian, General Commander He sent a telegram from Lushan, stating, "I, along with President Wang, Minister Song, Chief of Staff Zhu, Mr. Wu Zhihui, and Central Committee member Chen Bijun, flew from Nanjing to Xunyang on a Sikorsky aircraft on the morning of the 17th. We arrived safely at Guling at 1:00 PM that afternoon and paid our respects to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to discuss all matters. I (He) will return from Lushan the day after tomorrow to the department to handle all military affairs before returning to Nanjing." According to information obtained from Lushan and Jiujiang, Wang, Wu, Song, Zhu, He, Chen, and other Central Committee members arrived in Lushan after noon and held a meeting that evening at Chairman Chiang's residence. Lin, Chiang, and Wang all attended. Important issues such as Wang's resignation, the selection of a successor as President of the Executive Yuan, the Japanese invasion of Rehe, anti-Japanese measures, diplomacy at the League of Nations conference, post-anti-banditry arrangements, and the date for the Third Plenary Session were all discussed. Chairman Chiang gave a detailed report on anti-communist military affairs, and Song Ziwen also had new plans for unifying and reorganizing finances. The Central Committee members will remain in Lushan for another day or two to finalize discussions on the important issues before returning to Nanjing for approval by the central government for implementation. Therefore, the exact date of the Central Committee members' descent from the mountain is uncertain. However, He Yingqin, after going to Nanjing last month, has been away for over a month. The military affairs of the Anti-Banditry Headquarters in the three provinces require attention. After Guangdong and Fujian troops actively mobilized, the bandits Zhu, Mao, and Peng concentrated their forces in Xingguo, Ningdu, Yongfeng, and Guangchang on the central bank of the Gan River, actively advancing north towards Ji'an, Jishui, Nanfeng, Le'an, and Lichuan, creating a tense situation. He believed that the northward retreat of the bandits was a good opportunity to eliminate them. He has discussed a comprehensive suppression plan with Chairman Chiang and decided to return to the province the day after tomorrow to command the troops to encircle the bandits on the east bank of the Gan River, hoping to wipe them out in one swift stroke.

<h3>Peasant Uprising in Lingbi, Northern Anhui, Suppressed</h3>
<p>Communist Bandits Seize the Opportunity to Rise Up</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Farmers in the fifth district of Lingbi, Anhui Province, were provoked into revolt due to the county government's excessive collection of opium seedling taxes and oppression by the district head, Zhang Runan. They occupied villages and confiscated weapons, attracting the attention of the Anhui provincial authorities, who dispatched personnel to mediate. According to news from Shuanggu Town, Zhang Runan, the district head of the fifth district of Lingbi, seeing the severity of the farmer uprising and realizing the situation was unfavorable, fled to Xuzhou after the incident. However, the more than 2,000 angry farmers, gathering more than 2,000 weapons, entered Youji again and sealed up Tianxinghao Grocery Store, which was associated with Zhang. At that time, the town's garrison had already fled to Yugou Town. The rioters searched for the corrupt gentry Zhang Boyin, Li Shenwu, and Captain Li of Yangshan, who were in collusion with Zhang. They first distributed the grain stored by the corrupt gentry and then set fire to their houses. Unexpectedly, local bandits and communist elements, seeing the farmers' actions, also took the opportunity to rise up, using the farmers' name to confiscate the villagers' self-defense weapons. In Shangba, Xiewei, and Dazhaowei west of Shuanggu Town, more than a dozen weapons were confiscated. It is said that the bandit leader Zhao Leyi initiated this. At 8:00 AM on the 14th, a group of bandits gathered forty to fifty rifles and attacked Chaoyangji (18 li south of Shuanggu Town). Fortunately, the police and militia of the village were able to defend it, resisting the bandits. They fought fiercely for a day without being breached. At night, the bandits, unable to sustain the attack, retreated to the northwest. That night, the bandits entered Mengwei again to forcibly collect weapons. The villagers resisted and were not confiscated. On the same morning, dozens of bandits suddenly arrived at Dugu Heap south of Chaoyangji, claiming to be residents of Youji. The residents of the village, unprepared, were suddenly invaded, and extensive arson and looting took place. All the weapons in the village were seized. On the 15th, bandits attacked Jingquwei (northeast of Chaoyangji). The details are unclear. On the morning of the same day, communists were also discovered in Baijiawan north of Shuanggu Town, gathering sixty to seventy people with forty to fifty guns, confiscating all the weapons in the village. The Shuanggu Public Security Team, upon hearing the news, immediately sent police to investigate. After engaging in a battle with the bandits for more than ten minutes, the bandits retreated to the north. Currently, Shuanggu is heavily defended, so the bandits have not dared to approach. The local organizations in the town previously sent representatives to Xuzhou to request military assistance. However, the military authorities, considering that the farmers were forced into rebellion, have not yet sent troops. The Tongshan County government first sent a cavalry unit of thirty public security officers to be stationed in Shuang, and then sent fifty more police officers, coupled with the local defense corps, to provide strict defense, ensuring that there would be no incidents. However, the Yuwu Bureau in the town, seeing the rise of local bandits, the wealthy gentry fleeing to Xuzhou, recently petitioned Li Yannian, the Xuzhou Garrison Commander, to send troops to suppress them. It is unknown whether it will be approved. Jiang Dingwen, the Commander of the Second Army stationed in Bengbu and concurrently the Garrison Commander, is also paying close attention to the peasant uprising in Lingbi. In addition to telegraphing Li Yannian, the commander of the 9th Division stationed in Xuzhou, to handle the matter carefully nearby, he sent personnel to Lingbi's fifth district yesterday to investigate the truth of the farmers' anti-tax uprising. The Lingbi County government also telegraphed Bengbu to report to Jiang Dingwen, stating that after the county magistrate personally went to appease the rioters, they had gradually dispersed, the disturbance had subsided, and the situation would not escalate. However, the rioters have been appeased, and bandits have seized the opportunity to rise up, with communists commanding them. If the authorities do not quickly send a large army to suppress them, the border between Jiangsu and Anhui will likely not be peaceful. (August 19)</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Government Appeals for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Submitting a Petition to the Executive Yuan, Eloquently Describing the Situation of Disaster Victims Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>Requesting the Disaster Relief Commission to Allocate a Large Sum of Money to Organize Post-Disaster Rehabilitation</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Xia Douyin, the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, previously submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan in May, requesting the Disaster Relief Commission to allocate funds for relief due to the severe flooding and banditry suffered by the people of Hubei. The request was approved. However, a long time has passed, and the funds have not been distributed. As the anti-banditry operations are nearing victory, the disaster areas being recovered are increasing daily, and the number of disaster victims awaiting relief is also increasing daily. At the same time, funds are needed to carry out post-disaster rehabilitation. On the 20th, another telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan, appealing for disaster relief. The original telegram is as follows: "To President Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing: The various counties in Hubei Province have suffered from repeated bandit attacks after the floods, leaving the countryside devastated, villages in ruins, lush weeds along the roads, and corpses everywhere. The stench fills the air, and disease is rampant. Such calamities and disasters are unprecedented. For all post-disaster matters in the recovered bandit areas, a large amount of relief funds is needed to appease the refugees and pacify the rebellious. Moreover, the provincial treasury is depleted due to theft, and the people are exhausted. Helpless, I, Douyin, have eloquently described the dire situation and all the post-disaster matters that need to be addressed in the disaster areas in a telegram on May 9, requesting your compassionate consideration. This was brought before the 35th Executive Yuan meeting, which resolved to approve it and ordered the Disaster Relief Commission to allocate relief funds. Another telegram was sent on July 29, requesting the Disaster Relief Commission to remit the funds as soon as possible. We should patiently wait for the arrangements, but how dare we repeatedly petition. However, a long time has passed, and not a single cent has been remitted by the Disaster Relief Commission. While our hope is strong, we have not received any actual benefit. The dying disaster victims cannot wait any longer. Currently, the General Commander of Anti-Banditry Operations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Henan, and Hubei is stationed in Hubei to oversee the suppression of banditry in various counties. The bandit situation is gradually being cleared, and the disaster areas being recovered are increasing daily. Therefore, the number of disaster victims awaiting relief is also increasing daily, and the post-disaster matters that need to be addressed are now urgent. At this critical juncture, if the means to win back the hearts of the people are not met, not only will all previous efforts be wasted, but the subsequent recovery will be even more difficult. After the devastation, the remaining people will return home to find their houses in ruins and search for food only to find everything gone. In a blink of an eye, autumn will turn to winter. If they do not die of hunger and cold, they will inevitably become bandits. Douyin has a responsibility to care for them and feels guilty day and night. Therefore, I can only plead in another telegram, earnestly requesting the Executive Yuan to immediately order the Disaster Relief Commission to swiftly comply with the previous order and allocate a large sum of money to Hubei as soon as possible so that all urgent matters can be addressed. I await your orders with utmost urgency. Xia Douyin, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, respectfully bows. (August 20)"</p>

<p>Defense Forces in Western Fujian Return to Guangdong</p>
<p>19th Route Army Takes Over Defense of Shanghang and Yongding</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Before the 19th Route Army moved to southern Fujian, Guangdong dispatched the Independent 1st Division under Huang Renhuan to garrison Wuping and Shanghang, and the 7th Division under Huang Yanzhen to garrison Yongding, purely for defensive purposes to protect the upper reaches of the Zhang River. Last month, Luo Bingtan's troops in Changting burned and looted Longtan, Xiayang, and Zhongkeng in Yongding. The Ye regiment stationed in Yongding city did not engage. The 7th Division urgently dispatched the Training Regiment under Luo Tanchun to garrison Shishang Hutousha in Dapu. The Fujian bandits retreated upon hearing the news. At that time, Shen Guanghan's troops of the 19th Route Army had reached Longyan Shizhong and arrived in Longtan on the 25th. The bandits fled from Baisha back to Changting. The 19th Route Army was deployed between Hulei and Kanshi and entered Fengshi Shanghang on the 30th to prepare an offensive against Changting. The local communists in Yonghang fled into the mountains. Luo Zhichun, seeing the tranquility of the Fujian-Guangdong border, returned to Meixian from Dapu on the 2nd and stationed in the Ye regiment in Yongding city. After the 49th Division under Tu Sizhong sent troops to take over the defense, they returned to Guangdong. The Commander of the 1st Independent Division, Huang Renhuan, returned to Jiaoling from Shanghang on the 31st and camped inside and outside the city in ancestral halls and temples. Forty horses and artillery pieces were transported to Sanzhenwei on the border of Jiaoling. Huang led a company of guards to Meixian via Xinpuwei on the 2nd. Furthermore, Li Yangjing, the Commander of the 3rd Army, inspected the defenses in Heping Longchuan in the upper reaches of the Dong River on the 4th and was expected to arrive in Xingning around the 7th. He was scheduled to arrive in Meixian city on the 10th to discuss deploying troops to Jiangxi. Recently, local communists have gathered in Anyuan and Xunwu in Jiangxi, setting up decoy troops to restrain the Fujian-Guangdong-Jiangxi anti-banditry forces. The Chaozhou-Meizhou Cantonese troops will be able to enter Jiangxi to suppress bandits only after the main force of the 19th Route Army reaches western Fujian. The Red bandit Gu Dacun's troops sneaked into Fengshun County - Baxiangshan, Tongziyang, Xizitan, Huangfengliu, Jiulongzhang, Houyan, Niudoushe, Geduli, Xiaosang, Jinjing, Shen'ao, Gangdu, Hanxi, Douxi, Yetian, occupying civilian houses, looting rice, relying on danger to resist stubbornly. A gentleman named Zhang suggested to County Magistrate Zhang Wodong to ask Camp Commander He to be responsible for the search and suppression, and the police teams from various districts divided into ways to block. No matter where the Red bandits occupied areas are attacked, the good people should be rescued first and placed near the city. All the houses in the bandit areas should be set on fire and destroyed, so as not to be used as nests by bandits again. The Red bandits have no food and shelter, and the red flames will naturally go out. County Magistrate Zhang also greatly appreciated this suggestion. Fortunately, the Guangdong troops entering Fujian have now returned with a strong force, and the people of Fengshun can hope to drive Gu Dacun's bandits out of the country without burning civilian houses.

<p>Regulations for International War Pensions and Awards Determined by the Ministry of Military Affairs</p>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs, recognizing that various countries around the world have established regulations for pensions and awards for the army, navy, and air force in international wars, whereas our country still lacks such provisions, has already formulated the Regulations for International War Pensions for the Army and Air Force and the Regulations for Rewarding Meritorious Officers and Soldiers. Yesterday, it issued a circular to all military organizations to comply with these regulations. Excerpts of the two regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>Pension Regulations: Regulations for Preferential Pensions for the Army and Air Force in International Wars (1) Officers and soldiers who die in action or are severely injured and die as a result of international war (in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Wartime Pension Regulations), and those who are injured in action, shall be granted preferential pensions with promotion. (2) Those who become disabled due to international war shall, according to the regulations for transfer to hospitals, be promoted by one rank for their allowances and salaries when admitted to the Veterans' Rehabilitation Center. However, those who have already received preferential pensions with promotion shall be handled according to the pension rank they receive. (3) The children of the deceased officers and soldiers in international wars shall be given priority for admission to veterans' schools. (4) The pension procedures for these injured and deceased officers and soldiers shall be simplified and expedited in accordance with Article 20 of the Provisional Wartime Pension Regulations for the Army and Air Force, as follows: For the deceased, the directly subordinate senior officer shall fill out Form A of the investigation report and a certificate and submit them together. If the names and addresses of the legal family members are clearly stated in the forms, pensions may be granted in advance. Afterwards, the county government of the deceased's hometown shall submit Form B to the provincial government for verification and record. For the injured, after receiving treatment at the hospital, a certificate of injury grade shall be issued, attached with a recent 2.5-inch half-length photo of the injured person, and the detailed permanent mailing address shall be filled in. It shall be submitted by the original directly subordinate senior officer to the Ministry of Military Affairs for advance pensions. (5) The pension award orders for these injured and deceased may be filled and issued by the Ministry of Military Affairs first and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for record, in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Provisional Wartime Pension Regulations. (6) In the event of particularly heroic deaths or cases of significant importance, a request may be submitted to the National Government for an order to grant pensions first or for special promotions. Special funeral expenses may be granted to senior generals, officials may be sent to pay respects, and the civil affairs authorities of the deceased's hometown may choose a location to erect a monument. These are all special honors and should be reported for approval at any time.</p>
<p>Award Regulations: Regulations for Rewarding Meritorious Officers and Soldiers of the Army and Air Force in International Wars (1) All personnel who have performed meritorious service in international wars shall be awarded in accordance with these regulations. (2) The standards for awards shall be based on the already promulgated Army, Navy, and Air Force Medal Regulations (including the Blue Sky White Sun Medal specifically for international wars), the Army, Navy, and Air Force Award Regulations, the Regulations for Awarding Army, Navy, and Air Force Medals, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force Medal Awarding Method. (3) The responsible officer shall divide the combat personnel into three categories: special meritorious service, superior meritorious service, and ordinary meritorious service. They shall be compared to the awards for suppressing internal rebellions or bandits, such as promotion by one rank for awards. (4) In the future, when officers and soldiers are promoted, transferred, or appointed, these awards shall be considered as the primary achievement.</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Returns to Qingdao from Beiping</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: After Zhang Xueliang, the Pacification Commissioner of Beiping, telegraphed his resignation, Shen Honglie, the Mayor of Qingdao and Commander of the Northeastern Navy, was summoned to Beiping by Zhang. Shen repeatedly expressed his desire to resign to Zhang, but Zhang earnestly urged him to stay and not leave hastily. Shen, seeing the sincere pleas from all sides, returned south from Beiping and made a brief stop in Tianjin. He boarded train number 201 of the Pingpu Railway and arrived in Jinan at 9:00 AM this morning, staying at the Jiaoji Hotel. After a brief rest, he went to the provincial government to meet with Han Fuju and decided to return to Qingdao on the Jiaoji train at 9:00 PM tonight. According to Shen, Zhang's resignation has been approved. Although he is eager to leave, he is deeply concerned about the security of Tianjin, Beiping, and North China, which is of great importance, and is making proper arrangements. The Northeastern generals have shared hardships together for more than twenty years and have deep camaraderie. On a personal level, he feels reluctant to leave. On a public level, he fears misunderstandings that may arise from his departure, so he is taking great pains to make proper arrangements. He has been giving instructions to the generals for hours each day. Reports that Chairman Chiang will travel from Hankou to Beiping are false. Chiang is in Hankou directing the suppression of the communist military, a task of great responsibility. Nanjing is not a suitable place to stay in the short term, let alone Beiping. As for Rehe, there are currently no major changes. (August 20)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water Level Continues to Recede in Shandong</h3>
<p>Liuzhuang Stone Dam Still Not Completed</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Over the past few days, the water level has receded in both the upper and lower reaches, and the current has slowed. The situation at various hazardous worksites has generally stabilized. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, has been extremely busy. He just returned to Jinan from inspecting the river works downstream yesterday and reported to Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government. He is going to the upper reaches again this morning to inspect the hazardous worksites and the breach at the Huanghuasi levee, guiding the officers and soldiers in their defense. Chairman Han Fuju of the provincial government telegraphed him to supervise all officers and soldiers along the river in their patrol and defense, without the slightest negligence. Liuzhuang in the upper reaches is a well-known hazardous worksite located in Hebei Province. If there is a breach, the water will rush down, turning the counties in western Shandong into a marsh. Therefore, the Cao County River Works Promotion Association built a stone dam there two years ago to resist the water. The total cost of the project is 240,000 yuan. In addition to half of the amount being collected from the eight counties of Cao County along with taxes, the provincial government decided to allocate 120,000 yuan from the provincial treasury at the time. However, the stone dam project has not yet been completed. The Cao County River Works Promotion Association is now requesting the Department of Finance to release the provincial funds to complete the project. Today, at the standing committee meeting of the provincial government, the Department of Finance presented this case for discussion. It was decided that due to the shortage of funds in the provincial treasury, it was impossible to raise the money. The decision was made to allocate the funds when the finances are more abundant.

<h3>Zhu Jiqing's Three Declarations (Continued)</h3>
<p>Second Letter to Armed Comrades and Comrades Before Leaving the Pass It has been almost two months since we last met. I am very happy to see you again. This is not just a customary greeting, because I see that our internal strength has increased and there is reason to be optimistic. The last time I came, I greatly admired your spirit of hard struggle, but I was very worried about the lack of salaries and weapons. No matter how brave you are, how can you kill enemies with your bare hands, how can you fight with empty stomachs, and how can you deal with stubborn enemies who have sophisticated equipment and well-fed horses? It is not without danger. This time the situation is different. Since I returned to Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai and reported to all sectors about the struggle of our army in the past few months, all sectors were greatly moved, and donations of salaries and weapons have been pouring in continuously. The amount of money and ammunition received is quite considerable and has been distributed to various units. Although our army is stationed in a vast area and the number of people is large, it still feels like a drop in the bucket. But compared with the pitiful situation of no assistance at all last time, it must be said that it is much better. On the material side, it must be said that there is progress, which of course has a great relationship with the resistance to the enemy. That's why I'm so happy. However, because of this, I feel that there are some things I should say to you. (1) The current operations should be carried out rapidly. Now the fields are full of crops, a vast expanse of green. As the northerners say, "The green gauze curtain is up." Under such circumstances, the effectiveness of the enemy's planes and artillery is minimal. It is the best opportunity for us to fight. Of course, our struggle is long-term, but taking advantage of the natural conditions to inflict a major blow on the enemy is an indispensable strategy at present. What I mean is that no matter what, in the near future, we must have a vigorous and enthusiastic blow against the enemy. Moreover, the donations of salaries and weapons from all walks of life this time are full of expectations, and we must work harder to report back. Comrade Su Youxi in Shanghai, this time, because of the donations of salaries and weapons from all sides, ran around and died in an accident. It is the most tragic memory. If we have a slightly hesitant and timid appearance, not only will we be sorry for the enthusiastic living, but how can we be worthy of the dead who sacrificed their lives for public affairs? Therefore, the current combat operations must be pursued urgently and must not be delayed. This is one. (2) The funds received should be used practically. There are still many prevalent bad habits in the military, such as eating empty salaries and selling supplies. Those who know the situation cannot but be heartbroken. The leaders of the armed comrades of the National Salvation Army of our country are all pure and upright and are not afraid of being infected by this bad habit. However, there is indeed a lot of attention when it comes to the use of funds. If you are not careful and let go slightly, and the places where you can save and save cannot be extremely saved, it will inevitably have a negative impact on the power of the funds themselves. It must be known that we are now in a time of world economic panic, and our country is also the same. It is really not easy for all parties to generously donate money without any stinginess. If there is even a trace of extravagance, even if all parties do not blame us, will we ask ourselves, will our conscience be at peace? Now a Finance Committee has been established in the Command Headquarters, which is specifically responsible for auditing the expenditures of various departments. A separate Economic Committee is established in the place of economic sources. All members of the committee are domestic celebrities with good reputation, and there are many enthusiastic donors. The committee has the power to strictly supervise all expenditures. For example, if there is any doubt about the expenditures of Wu Zhibu's troops, the Commander-in-Chief shall be fully responsible to the committee. Such public finances leave no room for ambiguity. And this resistance is of a long-term nature. There are many places where we rely on the help of all parties in the future, and it is not limited to this time. In terms of expenditure, we show our serious and rigorous spirit. This is even more related to our future business reputation. This is the second. I think the above two points are the most important. In addition to making combat plans, organizing everything properly, and formulating various reimbursement methods, I will ask the comrades to abide by them and act in accordance with what I said, to restore the decline of the Chinese nation and to prevent the Japanese invaders from achieving their ambitions. The overall situation is fortunate, and I am fortunate. In addition, all troops under our army should make active contact, have sincere unity, strictly enforce discipline, improve coordination at any time, and thoroughly investigate traitors. There are many things to improve, as well as the work of contacting the people. I hope all comrades will carefully examine the environment and respond properly. I will no longer enumerate them one by one. (End)</p>

The county detective squad received a tip earlier this month that a bandit ship was hidden in Qingshui Port, located at the border of Kunshan and Taihe. Captain Bai, upon receiving the report, led his team in an investigation for several days, but found no trace of the ship. Around 9 p.m. on the 18th, a large ship appeared, carrying a dozen burly men. The team, finding their appearance suspicious, followed and investigated, but the bandits became aware of their presence and immediately abandoned the ship, landing and firing warning shots. Fortunately, the detective squad was prepared and surrounded them from both sides, engaging in a fierce battle for about an hour. The bandits, unable to hold out, fled. One bandit, Xu Hengde, was killed on the spot, and four others, Xu Shutang, Liu Tongsou, Deng Taobao, and Xu Hengle, were captured. One bandit ship and three guns were seized, and the kidnapped victim, Pan Xuerong, was rescued. All were handed over to the county for questioning. Request for funds to urgently repair the Changtai Seawall. The coastal seawalls of Changshu Xuliujing and Taicang Yuebingtai, Daotang Temple, Fangjia Yan, Yanglinkou, etc., have been severely damaged and collapsed due to years of disrepair. Director Dong of the Construction Department once visited Tai to inspect the damage. The main project requires approximately 700 zhang, and 30-40% of the military damage restoration project remains. If the weather is favorable, it can be completed before the Mid-Autumn Festival high tide. If repairs are not urgently carried out, the autumn flood will be very dangerous and cannot be delayed. Director Dong has forwarded a request to the Seawall Engineering Committee to allocate funds for urgent repairs and to continue to raise funds for the main project in order to strengthen coastal defense.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Guild of Inn Workers is ordered to disband. The Guild of Inn Workers, composed of inns and teahouses in Suzhou, has been in dispute for a long time over its incompatibility with the Trade Union Law, as teahouse employees are considered shop assistants and should join the relevant trade union. Yesterday, the county government received an order from the Industry Department, stating that the Guild of Inn Workers should be disbanded immediately. County Magistrate Zou immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to work with the district office to send personnel to implement the dissolution. All records and equipment were taken into custody by the district office.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>The county government plans to establish a National Products Exhibition Hall. The county government approved the proposal made at the 11th Representative Assembly of the County Party Department to establish a National Products Exhibition Hall. The Executive Committee decided at its 6th meeting to allocate funds for planning and sent a letter to the county government to prepare for its implementation. Yesterday, the county government ordered the County Chamber of Commerce and the district offices to discuss concrete implementation measures and report to the government for a scheduled meeting to form a preparatory committee, select a central location in the county, and find ways to establish the hall to facilitate viewing and completion.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Convicts from Kunshan compel fellow inmates to go on a hunger strike.</p>
<p>The county prison in this county was previously in disrepair, and the land was to be used for building a market. Therefore, more than 40 new prison cells were built in Dabudao Shan, which can accommodate more than 300 prisoners. They were completed in the spring of this year, and the prisoners were moved in together. Last month, the High Court ordered the transfer of 50 prisoners from Kunshan to Changshu due to overcrowding. However, these prisoners were inherently unruly. At the beginning of their arrival in Changshu, they stirred up trouble over the wetness and dryness of their food. Fortunately, the defense was well-managed, and no incidents occurred. Unexpectedly, these prisoners have recently compelled other inmates in the prison to go on a hunger strike, demanding the opening of shackles, etc. The prison director believes that the crimes of these criminals are deeply ingrained, and this kind of action may seriously hinder the future of prison administration, which is deeply worrying. Therefore, the Prison Building Committee and the Prison Coordination Association jointly sent a telegram to the High Court requesting that the 50 prisoners transferred from Kunshan be transferred to another prison.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>A case of forced suicide in Qishuyan. Cheng Shusheng, a waiter at the New New Inn in Qishuyan, Wuyi, was dismissed by the innkeeper Jiang Ruibao on the 16th of this month for some reason. He then sought employment at the Transportation Inn. Unexpectedly, on the 19th, the New New Inn was raided by the 10th Branch of the Public Security Bureau and fined for gambling. Innkeeper Jiang Ruibao suspected that Cheng Shusheng had reported him and secretly reported the matter to the 10th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who severely beat Cheng Shusheng that night. Unable to bear this injustice, Cheng Shusheng resented his life and secretly went to the small attic in the back, where he hanged himself with his own belt. His death was discovered at noon on the 20th, and the scene was tragic. The court, upon receiving the report, immediately sent personnel to conduct an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The detective team seizes stolen goods and evidence. Ren Songlin, the captain of the County Public Security Detective Team, was ordered by detective Hu Keyin, along with informant Zhang Zhongbao, to arrest the bandit Cui Xueshu. After sending him for investigation, they rushed to Dayi to arrest the principals involved in the case of shooting and killing Ying Guonei. The three principals, Bian Shiqian, Bian Shicai, and Bian Shichang, were arrested. Yesterday, they were sent along with a related letter, fourteen red slips, a razor, a list of stolen goods, and a donkey ridden by Bian Shili found in the principal's home. They were sent to the team for interrogation. The letter was quite cunning. In addition to ordering detective Hu to urgently arrest the "Big Man" bandit, the stolen goods, evidence, and prisoners were sent to the Public Security Bureau early on the 20th and transferred to the county to be handled by the court.</p>
<p>Shaobo Hengyu Pawnshop is approved to resume business. Shaobo Hengyu Pawnshop suspended business last autumn due to flooding. It has now joined new shareholders and has been reorganized. It is scheduled to resume business on September 4th, solely for the livelihood of the poor.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>The corpse is transported to the city for autopsy in the case of a killing of a nephew. Meng Laixuan, director of the 5th Branch (Chahui) of the County Public Security Bureau, reported that Ji Shen, who lives in Lujiabao Village, reported that her husband, Ji Fu, went to her maternal uncle Xu Zhunlin's house in Xujia Village on August 5th to borrow ten yuan to prepare for a trip to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Xu Zhunlin not only refused to lend him the money, but also beat Ji Fu to death. The corpse was placed in a coffin and buried. Xu Er and Liu Er were present at the scene of the beating to help. The petitioner urgently requested the bureau to forward the case to the county government and request the dispatch of personnel to conduct an autopsy and arrest the murderer to seek justice. The branch director, based on this, immediately submitted the case to the bureau for forwarding to the county government. It is now known that the county government has ordered the branch director to transport Ji Fu's coffin to the city for autopsy and to interrogate Xu Er and Liu Er.</p>
<p>Bombs are discovered during the well dredging project. During a well dredging project yesterday outside the South Gate of the Kaowu Ting training ground, six iron objects were excavated, each weighing more than ten jin. Both ends had screw mechanisms and were elongated and rounded, presumably bombs. The director of the training ground immediately prohibited their movement and reported to the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to transport the bombs to the bureau to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Notorious bandit Zhang Xiqiao is arrested. Zhang Xiqiao, a notorious bandit from Nanxiayang, Kaowu Ting, was wanted by the county government for a previous crime. He went to Shanghai for more than a year and had not returned. A few days ago, he suddenly returned to his hometown. Wang Xuguangshou of Hongji Town, the victim, learned of this and secretly reported to the county government. Magistrate Qian, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered detective captain Yang Zhao to lead a team to capture him, and he was taken to the brigade headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Aiding and abetting blackmail is adjudicated. Huang Ruiting, the chief of Lishui Town, Jiaxing, was previously involved in a case where a letter signed "Yi Shibin" demanded 30,000 yuan, containing many threatening words. The base squad of the Yuxian District Security Corps detained Zhou Changming, the bandit involved in the case, in Yuxian Town. After interrogation, Zhou Changming confessed that "Yi Shibin" was an alias used by Chen Renli, so he was the principal offender. The squad set out to arrest Chen, but Chen had already fled. His wife Wu and his father-in-law Wu Abiao were arrested and sent to the court for interrogation. After multiple interrogations by the court, Wu and Wu Abiao were not prosecuted due to insufficient suspicion. Zhou Changming was sentenced yesterday to two years and five months of imprisonment and fined 300 yuan for aiding and abetting blackmail.</p>
<p>The Yuan Da Money Exchange is liquidated. Shen Boji, the manager of the Yuan Da Money Exchange in Jiaxing, has been operating the exchange with mediocre results in recent years. Last winter, it was nearly liquidated. Due to the Shanghai Incident, all industries were suspended, further worsening the situation. Recently, due to financial difficulties, Shen fled. The exchange sent all the books and 1,900 yuan of cash to the Money Exchange Association to handle the matter. The association immediately announced the liquidation. Since the manager was in hiding and could not handle the liquidation, a warning was published in the newspaper, requiring Shen to return to He. Shen returned to He yesterday and is working with the association to begin the liquidation.</p>
<p>Rice stem borers are rampant in the southern countryside. Rice stem borers are rampant in the southern countryside of Jiaxing. The County Pest Control Association has allocated funds to purchase and eliminate them. From the 15th to the 20th, the association received more than 1.7 million rice stem borer eggs from Xinhuang, Xinfeng, Qifeng, and other districts, with a cost of more than 1,320 yuan. Other districts are still collecting and sending them. The severity of the pest damage is alarming.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Tao Sijin appeals to the Supreme Court. Tao Sijin, a female student at the Art Academy, appealed to the High Court in the case of killing Liu Mengying. The High Court revoked the original first-instance judgment and changed the sentence to death for Tao and two years of imprisonment for Xu Qinwen. Liu's sister, Qingxing, was satisfied with the death sentence for Tao, but felt that the sentence for Xu was too lenient and submitted a petition to the High Court Procuratorate to appeal according to law. Tao Sijin also disagreed with the second-instance judgment and hired lawyer Wang Gong to file an appeal with the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>A family of six tragically loses five members. An epidemic has recently broken out in Fangmen Village, Songlin District, Fenghua. Mr. Lu, a nearly 70-year-old resident, had a son, two grandsons, a wife, and a daughter-in-law. His son died of the epidemic a few days ago. The next day, his two grandsons also died. On the fourth day, his daughter-in-law died, and on the fifth day, his wife died. In a period of six days, a total of five people died. Mr. Lu himself did not die, but was overwhelmed with grief.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>One kidnapper is captured in Tianle Township. Cao Qijin, a fisherman outside the South Gate of Xiaoshan, reported that his grandson was kidnapped by bandits on the night of the 10th. County Magistrate Zhang Zonghai immediately ordered detectives to investigate. He recently heard that the kidnapped grandson was in Tianle Township and sent patrol captain Xu Jiande and detective captain Chen Zurong with four detectives to secretly capture the kidnappers on the 10th. Unexpectedly, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The two sides fought for 20 minutes. The bandits were unable to hold out and notorious bandit Xu Haisheng was captured and sent to the county for strict interrogation that night.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>A major criminal is arrested and sent to the county for poisoning and killing people. After the discovery of the poisoning case at the Dongyue Temple well in Hefei City, no arrests were made. After that, personnel were assigned to monitor the well outside the Gongjing during the day and it was covered and sealed at night. The criminals did not dare to show their tracks and turned to poisoning in the four villages. The tiger epidemic has now spread to the eastern Xiangdian Pu and the southern Xiang Sanhe, and the dead are numerous.</p>
<p>The villagers, unable to get timely rescue and treatment, suspected poisoning and guarded day and night. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 16th, the villains Wang Yongkui and Chen Zhifu were caught poisoning a well in Dong Thirty Villages. Two packs of black poison were found on the spot. Wang was burned to death by the villagers, and Chen was sent to the county by Zheng Siming, the chief of the Second District, on the 17th. County Magistrate Sun believes that the case is important and is conducting a secret trial.</p>
<p>Gangs of local bandits are rampant in the western countryside. In the areas of Jiangjunling, Changgangdian, and Gaoliuji in Hefei, this year's drought has caused the rice to dry up and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Thousands of people have turned to banditry, looting and extorting at will, occupying villages and towns with great momentum. County Magistrate Sun of Hefei has sent Security Corps Chief Xia Wentang to lead a team to suppress them and has requested assistance from the 55th Division Yang Mingfang Brigade stationed in Jinqiao Guanting to maintain order.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Yan Ziqing</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao: I have read the section "Inside Story of the Soil Smuggling Case in Tongcheng, Nantong" in the local correspondence column of your newspaper on the 16th. It states that the principal offender, Wai Fu, is Yan Ziqing, the accountant of the Public Security Bureau, and that the capital for soil smuggling was misappropriated from 2,000 yuan in rent deposits. After investigation, our bureau arrested ten smugglers, including Cheng Guangbin, and immediately sent them to the Nantong Court for interrogation. The procuratorate is currently conducting a court investigation and has found no involvement of public officials. The bureau's rent is collected and remitted immediately, with no deposits. The details reported by your newspaper are presumably based on false rumors. I am writing to request a correction. I hope you will publish it in the newspaper. Sincerely, Yan Ziqing, August 19th.</p>

<h3>Closing Ceremony of the National Sports Conference</h3>
<p>The sixth general assembly was held in the morning, followed by the closing ceremony.</p>
<p>The "National Physical Education Implementation Plan" was passed and a declaration was issued.</p>
<h3>Congratulatory Success for the Conference Chonggan</h3>
<p>At this time of strong neighbors pressing our borders and national crisis looming, the Ministry of Education's convening of the National Physical Education Conference holds profound significance. The Conference Preparatory Committee first requested physical education experts to draft a National Physical Education Implementation Plan, and received over two hundred proposals from various parties. Representatives from various agencies and experts, numbering over one hundred, were gathered and spent five and a half days during this hot season, thoroughly discussing and passing a comprehensive [National Physical Education Implementation Plan] suitable for our national conditions and easy to implement. The goal is to complete the implementation within five years, which is truly an important path to continuing the life of our nation. The reporter respectfully wishes the conference success.</p>
<p>It has been a long time since our country advocated physical education, but there has been no definite goal or suitable method. Some have even misunderstood that sports competitions are physical education, not knowing that sports are only one type of activity in physical education. Now that the plan has set five goals, there is a standard to follow from now on, and there will be no more misunderstandings. In addition to stipulating goals, the plan also details the physical education administrative organization, funding regulations, teacher training, performance evaluation, and implementation methods. It also sets out the various conditions to be completed within three years and five years. Thus, from today onwards, our country's promotion of physical education will have goals, organization, methods, be easy to popularize and complete, unlike the cluelessness of the past.</p>
<p>The reporter here deeply hopes that the government will vigorously implement the plan without losing the original intention of convening the meeting, and that the public will assist in the implementation without failing the expectations of the conference. Then the nation will have hope for continued survival.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>First Case</p>
<p>(1) Du Tingxiu suggested that the establishment of physical education committees at all levels under the administrative and organizational system, regarding provinces, cities, and counties, has too long a time limit. The limit for provinces and cities should be changed from June to February, and the limit for counties and cities should be changed from one year to one month.</p>

(4) The Chairman's amendment was passed without objection.</p>
<p>Second Case</p>
<p>(1) Chen Mengyu suggested that under the teacher training section, for universities and high school teachers, 1. The National Physical Education College should be changed to Physical Education College and a vocational school should be added; for junior high school and elementary school teachers, 2. The Provincial Physical Education Vocational School, limiting vocational schools to the provincial scope, is too narrow.</p>
<p>(2) Wu Guonan explained that the case of private physical education colleges had already been passed, and Mr. Shi Zhen also said that previously passed motions should not be discussed.</p>
<p>(3) Chen Shizhen proposed an amendment: for university and high school teachers, 2. Change it to public and registered private universities that appropriately set up physical education departments; for junior high school and elementary school teachers, 2. Change it to public and registered provincial physical education vocational schools. Wu Yunrui and others seconded.</p>
<p>(4) Chen Mengyu asked Director Gu Shusen whether graduates of vocational schools could teach in high schools.</p>
<p>(5) Gu Shusen explained that vocational school graduates can teach in high schools, and suggested that the item for university and high school teachers be divided into two items, which could solve the difficulty.</p>
<p>(6) Yuan Dunli said that Mr. Gu's suggestion could be recorded in the minutes.</p>
<p>(7) The Chairman agreed with Yuan Dunli's proposal, which was passed without objection.</p>
<p>Third Case</p>
<p>(1) Su Jingyou said that the case of the position of national martial arts in physical education and the establishment of national martial arts halls is conflicting and should be amended.</p>
<p>(2) Du Tingxiu proposed to cancel the section on [the position of national martial arts in physical education], and there is no need to dwell on the trivial details.</p>
<p>(3) Xu Yusheng proposed to retain the original proposal.</p>
<p>(4) The Chairman put it to a vote, and the majority agreed that this section should remain, and it was passed. Fourth Case</p>
<p>(1) Xu Yusheng suggested that in the matter of experimental areas, under the organization of national martial arts classes, it should be changed to (such as the new Chinese martial arts Tai Chi exercises, those that conform to scientific principles can be adopted and used).</p>
<p>(2) The Chairman put it to a vote and it was passed.</p>
<p>Fifth Case</p>
<p>(1) Du Tingxiu suggested that under the equipment section, the field size of one hundred square feet should be changed to the Chinese unit of "mu."</p>
<p>(2) Hao Gengsheng opposed Du's amendment.</p>
<p>(3) Chen Shizhen said that there is no need to discuss the wording too much (the audience applauded). Different opinions can be submitted to the Ministry of Education for reference, which was approved by the audience.</p>
<p>Sixth Case</p>
<p>(1) Sun Mingxiu suggested that under the teacher treatment section, outstanding physical education teachers should not advance or retreat with the principal. Hao Gengsheng explained the reason for not adding trivial details.</p>
<p>(2) Sun Mingxiu argued that at least an item on guaranteeing physical education teachers should be added. (3) Chen Shizhen said that guaranteeing teachers is not limited to physical education, and the Ministry of Education is making every effort to handle it (the audience applauded).</p>
<p>At this point, the Chairman announced the end of the discussion. The plan was formally passed, and each proposal still stands alone and will be sent to the Ministry of Education for reference.</p>

<h3>Zhu Jiahua's Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education is willing to make the greatest effort</p>
<p>To develop the national physical education cause evenly</p>
<p>The foundation of physical education that China needs</p>
<p>Is to cultivate the spirit of cooperation and unity among the people</p>
<p>The National Physical Education Conference is closing today. Although our session has only lasted five days, in these five days, we have been able to gather many physical education experts and comrades responsible for physical education in various places to discuss, exchange ideas, and formulate a National Physical Education Implementation Plan. It has indeed opened a new era for the future of physical education in China. The Ministry of Education is very grateful for the enthusiasm of all of you who have come from afar, and especially grateful for your efforts in sweating these past few days. Your efforts in these few days have already borne a very large fruit. This fruit did not exist before. Before this conference, comrades working hard in various places each had their own ideas and their own methods. Opinions were inconsistent and actions were inconsistent. Therefore, for decades, the improvement of national physical education has been slow, with little satisfactory effect. On the Ministry of Education side, because the opinions of comrades in various places could not be unified and actions could not be consistent, it was difficult to cooperate with each other. Even if there was a desire to make the entire country's physical education undergo a comprehensive improvement, it was difficult to realize. Now you have formulated a comprehensive plan. This comprehensive plan is at least a manifestation of your unified will. With this unified will, from now on, the Ministry of Education and all of you can follow this unified will, consider the actual situation, and work together to seek the improvement of national physical education. The Ministry of Education is extremely willing to make the greatest efforts to make the national physical education cause develop evenly with other causes, and to make a fresh start with all of you. The Ministry of Education also hopes that all of you will, based on this spirit of unified will, work with the Ministry of Education and comrades striving for physical education improvement. The purpose of national physical education cannot be separated from the country and cannot be separated from society. Improving national physical education must be carried out in the meaning of the country and society in order to not lose its effectiveness. Especially in today's China, there is the pressure of strong enemies from outside, and the chaos caused by bandits and natural disasters from within, the country is in danger, and society is bankrupt. Unless all 400 million compatriots in the country are fully mobilized, the country will never be saved, and society will never be saved. The so-called individuals will also perish together. To mobilize the entire country, one cannot but sacrifice individual freedom. In today's Chinese environment, the improvement of national physical education is to cultivate the physical foundation for national mobilization. We want to seek full and balanced development of the physique of every citizen, but more importantly, it is to make every citizen have a strong and lively physique as the foundation for uniting against insults and cooperating in building the country. Past competitive sports, although an unavoidable transitional phenomenon in the improvement of national physical education, have resulted in the free development of individuality exceeding the development of society, which cannot be denied. In each school, there are many athletes with extremely developed large muscles, but the general students are still in a state of pale and weak skin, hunched backs, and uninspired spirits, which cannot create a good impression on society. This is neglecting the concept of society.</p>
<p>What China needs now is the solidarity and cooperation of the entire nation, because sports require cooperation and unity. Therefore, we must pay special attention to this point in physical education. Therefore, what we need even more is a general increase in the level so that we can cooperate and unite. Therefore, in the plan that all of you have set in this conference, setting the goal of [cultivating the spirit of national cooperation and unity], I personally admire your insightful views very much. I hope that when all of you go back to work hard to improve your work this time, you will always remember this goal, so that the citizens who receive your guidance and are cultivated physically can all obtain a strong and lively physical foundation for cooperation and unity. The impact of the convening of this physical education conference is not limited to the great improvement of national physical education.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting's Response</h3>
<p>Supplementing Three Points of View</p>
<p>Strong Country and Strong Race Both Start with Physical Education</p>
<p>Promoting Physical Education to Replace Bad Habits</p>
<p>It is hoped that the Resolved Plan will be earnestly implemented</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure and a great shame to be ordered by the Chairman to deliver a response on behalf of all members.</p>
<p>Today, the first thing all of you present should do is to thank the Ministry of Education for its thoughtful hospitality. On behalf of all members, I would like to thank the Minister and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education and Mr. Chu, the Preparatory Committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu has already explained the spirit of the plan of this conference. I will now briefly supplement a few points on behalf of the members.</p>
<p>The Chinese people have never recognized the importance of the body and have always only focused on the artistic and moral aspects. Although it was listed as one of the six arts in ancient times, no one pays attention to it now. We often say that we want to seek longevity and immortality. How can we achieve longevity and immortality? After a hundred years, a strong body inherited to future generations is longevity and immortality. Therefore, a strong country and a strong race both start with physical education. This is the first point of supplementation.</p>
<p>In human society, every move is formed by habit. The bad habits of the Chinese people are extremely dangerous. Gambling and opium are both suicide. The reason why Chinese people have bad habits is that they do not have good physical education to replace them. The formation of habits lies in insufficient energy. There are strong and healthy races in the world, such as the Anglo-Saxons, where one person has a sports field and two people have a sports field, and there will never be bad habits. We are promoting good habits, such as indoor and outdoor sports, to replace bad habits. This is the second point to be supplemented.</p>
<p>The big problem of the Chinese people is that meetings are one thing and implementation is another. The spirit is very good during the meeting, but after the meeting is over, it is put on a high shelf. Physical education is related to the survival of the nation and must never be done this way. It is hoped that it will be implemented in a concrete and realistic manner. On the government side, it is hoped that the plan will be vigorously promoted. On the member side, it is hoped that they will help the government and work hard to promote the plan. This is the third point of supplementation. Finished.</p>
<h3>Conference Declaration</h3>
<p>Promoting National Physical Education</p>
<p>Is an Essential Path to Continuing National Life</p>
<p>After the Conference Closes</p>
<p>The Launch of Our Country's New Physical Education Begins</p>
<p>Regardless of Old or New, Chinese or Foreign</p>
<p>As the New Banner of the New Physical Education from Now On</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has convened this conference to actively promote national physical education in order to plan the future progress and development of national physical education. At this time of strong neighbors pressing our borders and national crisis looming, this conference feels that the mission it bears is even more important. It has exhausted the hearts and minds of the masses to formulate a National Physical Education Implementation Plan to be implemented. There is something that should be told to the people of the country here.</p>
<p>In the past hundred years, our country has not only suffered various invasions by imperialists that endanger its survival, but also the national body has become weaker day by day. If we do not think about ways to strengthen the race and the body, even if we have a population of 400 million, we will be subject to natural elimination. This conference believes that promoting national physical education is an important path to continuing national life. However, the implementation of national physical education must never be allowed to develop in a distorted manner. It must be earnestly promoted and strive for universalization so that the people of the whole country become healthy members. Only then will national physical education be effective. Therefore, this conference especially believes that universal development is an important condition for the implementation of national physical education. The more universal it is, the more it can be improved, and the more it is improved, the more it can progress. It is deeply hoped that the people of the whole country will have a clear understanding of this and make the greatest efforts for continuous progress.</p>
<p>What this conference further solemnly declares is that after the closing of this conference is the beginning of the launch of our country's new physical education. From now on, we should base our standards for implementing national physical education on national conditions and national character. All kinds of physical education activities that do not violate scientific principles and are suitable for human nature, regardless of their different sources, should not be discriminated against. They should all be based on this standard, take the best from each, and be promoted equally. Copying and imitating will certainly lose the nation's self-confidence, and being stuck in the past will also lose the nation's greatness. Therefore, for the sake of the future of physical education in our country, this conference deeply hopes that the people of the whole country will adopt the attitude of [choosing the good and following it] towards ways to strengthen the body and activities, not distinguishing between old and new, Chinese and foreign, and stand under the new banner of the new physical education from now on to promote the rapid advancement of national physical education.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Reports on Yesterday's Closing Ceremony</h3>
<p>Photographed by Guanghua in Nanjing</p>
<p>The plans decided by this conference are all based on this purpose and are specified in detail. Considering the past lack of direction in physical education, the formulation of the scope and goals of physical education, and feeling that there was no specialized agency to preside over physical education in the past, there is a resolution to regulate the national physical education administrative organization. Regarding the cultivation of talents and the determination of funding, detailed discussions and many opinions were also proposed. In addition, the principles of equipment, the methods of evaluation, the organization of curriculum and teaching materials, the special promotion of national martial arts, and the phased implementation plan are all consistent with the above-mentioned points, and theory and facts are taken into account. If the whole country can be united and work together, our Chinese nation will have hope of revival. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Members Leave Beijing to Return Home</h3>
<p>Chu Minyi and Chen Kui Sheng Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st Telegram. On the evening of the 20th, except for members from this capital who had left the society, most of the other members had left Beijing to return home. Sixteen rooms in the Lizhi Society have been vacated. All members will leave the society at noon tomorrow. Hao Gengsheng and others are scheduled to return to Ping by train on the evening of the 21st. Chu Minyi and Chen Kui Sheng are going to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of the Conference</h3>
<p>Hospitality for Members Ends This Afternoon</p>
<p>Conference Announcement: This conference has extended the hospitality for members until 12:00 PM on the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>Members Praise the Diligent Physical Education Series</p>
<p>The physical education series published by the Shanghai Diligent Bookstore is a collection of writings by more than 20 physical education experts including Wu Yunrui, Yuan Dunli, Jin Zhaojun, Wu Bangwei, Jiang Xiangqing, Jin Zhaojun, Song Junfu, Peng Wenyu, Wang Fudan, and Wang Nengfei. More than 30 types have been published and displayed at the conference venue. Those who see it all praise it as an unprecedented specialized book on physical education and a good tool for implementing the national physical education plan. In addition, the Shanghai Standard Sports Equipment Company and the National Goods Sports Equipment Company, which displayed national goods sports equipment, also received praise from the members.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Conference Venue</h3>
<p>Debate on Physical Education and National Martial Arts: When the conference discussed the proposal to establish a specialized school for national martial arts, the members split into two factions. One side said that national martial arts is a part of physical education and there is no need to set up a separate institute to study it, and it can be included in the physical education specialized school. The other side strongly opposed, saying that national martial arts is a unique sport in our country and has great effects on fitness and strengthening the country, and can fully express patriotic thought. Looking back at today's physical education, it takes copying other countries as its ability, but abandons and is unwilling to use the national essence, and also forgets its roots. Therefore, in order to remedy the lack of national martial arts talents, it is necessary to set up a specialized institute for research and promotion. During the debate, the excitement was beyond words, especially Ma Liang's leaving his seat, pounding the table, and speaking loudly. However, the latter failed in the vote.</p>
<p>A Certain Expert's Candid Words: When a certain expert discussed the proposal that experts should be fully hired to prepare for the holding of sports meets, he said that before the Central Sports Field was prepared, because no experts participated in the planning, more than one million yuan was wasted, and the venue was built at the foot of a mountain more than ten miles away from the city. Because there are no trams in Beijing, the athletes are limited to a very small number of automobile classes, and the common people cannot enjoy it. After twenty years of calculating the principal and interest, the country's losses reached a huge amount of 16 million yuan. This is the drawback of not hiring experts for preparation. He also said that physical education is a whole and should not be divided into men and women, nor should it be prefixed with the titles of men and women experts. The proposal was therefore passed.</p>
<p>A Faithful Follower of Islam: Expert Ma Liang, a follower of Islam, shaved his head and grew a beard, wore a white shirt that reached his knees, with a slit in the back, like a western-style overcoat, with short sleeves and trousers that reached his heels, white socks and black shoes, and his attire was different from others. He spoke eloquently, and ate alone during meals because it was inconvenient to break his fast. He could be called a true believer.</p>
<p>The True Spirit of Female Members: Among the members of the conference, five were female members and several were auditors. From the opening day to the closing day, they all attended on time and did not slack off. They also often stood up to take responsibility for speaking. Their spirit can be praised.</p>
<p>National Physical Education Implementation Plan (1)</p>
<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
<p>To solve a problem, one must first recognize the meaning and scope of the problem itself, and then discuss the solution. The meaning of the two characters "physical education" varies greatly in different eras and different societies, and the general public has different views on physical education. If its meaning is not clarified first and its scope is not clearly defined, and an implementation plan is hastily formulated, not only will there be nowhere to start when starting, but it is inevitable that the result will be contrary to the original wish after implementation, which is extremely dangerous. Therefore, before drafting this plan, the meaning and scope of physical education must be briefly stated.</p>
<p>The two characters "physical education" are regarded by ordinary people as nothing more than physical exercise. Since the advent of biology and psychology, the traditional dualism of mind and body can no longer exist. Moreover, the purpose of modern education is not only to provide knowledge, but to train the entire organism's life. Therefore, we deeply understand that although the surface of physical education is large muscle activity, it causes many physiological and psychological changes, and it is an indispensable method for the training of the entire organism's life. Therefore, the meaning of physical education is not only physical exercise, but to provide educational opportunities from the various large muscle activities of the body. In other words, in order to achieve various educational goals, physical activity is a major means and method. The development and health promotion of the organism is a natural result of physical activity. Physical education not only achieves this goal, but also has other important educational goals, such as social morality, basic living skills, methods of using leisure time well, and attitudes and abilities that citizens must have, all of which can be trained and cultivated through various physical activities. Therefore, physical education and education cannot be separated into two. The only difference is that physical education only uses the large muscle activity of the body as a method to achieve educational goals, while the methods adopted by education to achieve its goals, in addition to physical education, still have other kinds. Therefore, all physical education facilities must be standardized to be able to achieve the entire educational purpose. At the same time, all those who do not use the educational method of large muscle activity of the body must not be called physical education. In order to clearly recognize the scope of physical education, the following points must be explained here.</p>
<h3>(1) Physical Education and Military Training</h3>
<p>The purpose of military training is to provide citizens with military knowledge, train citizens' ability to resist insults, and cultivate citizens' national consciousness. At present, military training in schools at all levels focuses on infantry drills. Moreover, because the training is not strict enough, not only is it difficult to achieve the purpose of true military training, but even soldiers who blindly follow orders and are not afraid of death cannot be obtained. To achieve the purpose of military training, on the one hand, it is necessary to strive for the development of science and industry, and the stability and consolidation of society and economy. On the other hand, in addition to giving citizens of considerable age strict and thorough training in military life, it is necessary to cultivate national consciousness in many ways invisibly. All subjects in schools must take this as their purpose, especially history, geography, and civics are the most effective. As for physical education, it provides citizens with fully developed bodies and brave and quick-witted spirits. It goes without saying that it makes a major contribution to achieving the purpose of military training invisibly. If one thinks that infantry drills are physical education and takes them as the main method of training military citizens, then the fallacy is extremely serious. Therefore, in addition to the value of physical education itself, which indirectly contributes to military training, the government has other methods for all aspects of the entire military training, and there is no need to involve it.</p>
<h3>(2) Physical Education and Hygiene and Health Education</h3>
<p>Because physical education can promote development and health, people often think that physical education is a part of hygiene, or that hygiene is a part of physical education. In fact, the two have their own scope and cannot be confused into one. From a social perspective, hygiene is one of the important functions of the government, including the provision of medicine, the improvement of the environment, the prevention of diseases, and the establishment of public health training and guidance. From a school perspective, health is one of the most important goals of education, including health protection and inspection, environmental health facilities, and appropriate health education. Health is an element of life, and education is related to actual life. All activities and facilities in schools cannot be without the meaning and components of health education. Physical education is one of the subjects and activities in schools, and makes a considerable contribution to health education. The inevitable result of physical education is to promote the development and health of the organism, as mentioned earlier, which is its greatest contribution to health education. However, in addition to this inevitable health result, physical education still has other major contributions to education. Moreover, the components of physical education are purely large muscle activities, and the components of health education contain all school activities and education. Therefore, although physical education and health education both belong to the scope of education, they are actually very different. This plan can only be based on the scope of physical education and does not involve hygiene and health education.</p>
<h3>(3) Physical Education and Labor</h3>
<p>Since physical education addresses the inactivity of large muscles, some people often consider it similar to labor, and some even advocate replacing physical education with labor. However, they fail to realize that the purpose and meaning of the two are different. The purpose of labor is production, while the purpose of physical education is education. Labor can harm children's bodies, so it is generally recognized by sociologists and educators that children who have not reached adulthood should not engage in labor. Physical education is the only tool for developing the body and mind. If productive labor replaces children's games and sports, there is nothing more detrimental to depriving children of development and educational opportunities. Labor is work for adults, while physical education is recreation. Work is essential for life, and appropriate recreation is also indispensable. Furthermore, the various educational goals that physical education aims to achieve, as mentioned earlier, cannot be achieved through labor. Therefore, those who advocate replacing physical education with labor overly believe in utilitarianism and neglect the various educational meanings within physical education.</p>
<h3>(4) Physical Education and Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>The Boy Scouts, originally a training for young people to serve as scouts in wartime, has gradually developed into a multi-faceted youth training organization. Its main content is to provide young people with opportunities to interact with nature and society, to cultivate various life skills and correct attitudes towards people and things. The method of organization is purely extracurricular activities, just like applying what is learned in the school classroom to practical exercises in this extracurricular design. Therefore, the Boy Scouts are a whole educational design to achieve its special goals. Physical education cannot replace the Boy Scouts, just as the Boy Scouts cannot replace physical education. As for the various physical activities and skill tests practiced by the Boy Scouts, they are certainly not unrelated to physical education. Because it is a whole educational design, it cannot but adopt many physical activities and materials. However, these physical activities and materials should have considerable connection with the school's physical education curriculum, needless to say.</p>
<h3>(5) The Status of Traditional Chinese Martial Arts in Physical Education</h3>
<p>Traditional Chinese martial arts are a unique physical activity method of our nation. On the one hand, it can provide self-defense skills, and on the other hand, it can be used as a tool for physical exercise. It not only has a fixed value in national history, but also cannot be overly criticized from the perspective of modern science such as anatomy and physiology. Promoting and researching it is necessary today. However, academics have no national boundaries, and human nature is the same regardless of origin. All kinds of physical activities that do not violate scientific principles and are suitable for human nature should be promoted equally according to the social conditions in the country. There should be no distinction based on their place of origin. Therefore, traditional Chinese martial arts are a kind of physical activity and should not be given a special status simply because they are unique to our country, to abandon other physical activities that are in line with science and education. On the other hand, since academics have no national boundaries, our country's traditional Chinese martial arts should strive for its development in the international community. It should not be regarded as a rare commodity. Looking at Japanese judo, which has recently been learned by many people in Europe and the United States, how much more profound are the mysteries of our country's traditional Chinese martial arts? As for domestic physical educators, they should pay close attention to and study traditional Chinese martial arts, while traditional Chinese martial artists should also have a considerable understanding of modern physical education and its basic disciplines. This is a necessary way to promote and research traditional Chinese martial arts.</p>
<h3>Two Goals</h3>

<p>2.  Train the ability of the people to use their bodies flexibly to adapt to the environment.</p>
<p>3.  Cultivate the spirit of cooperation and unity among the people.</p>
<p>4.  Cultivate the national spirit of chivalry, courage, perseverance, and hard work, and promote the national spirit.</p>
<p>5.  Cultivate the habit of using sports and games as recreation for the people.</p>

The match between Qiang Nan and Jin De was terminated immediately. The match between Qing Nian and Yue Qun continued as usual and did not stop due to the heavy rain.

It is heard that the Municipal Education Bureau has approved his request and transferred Chen Xiangxin, the principal of the Wusong Elementary School, to succeed as the principal of the South District School.</p>
<h3>Twenty Groups Held a Garden Party Yesterday to Bid Farewell to Students Going Abroad</h3>
<p>Various Circles Encourage Each Other to Seek Practical Knowledge to Save the Country</p>
<p>More Than Forty Students Going Abroad Will Set Sail at 4 PM Today</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Min Bao, Chen Bao, Da Wan Bao, China Global Student Association, China Review Weekly, Jiaotong University, Jinan University, Fudan University, Guanghua University, Business School of Central University, International Problems Research Association, Tsinghua Alumni Association, Hua Mei Xie Jin Society, China Vocational Education Society and other twenty groups held a farewell meeting at 4:30 yesterday afternoon in Mayor Wu's Garden at 474 Haig Road. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Education Bureau Chief Xu Peihuang, former Minister to Italy Wu Zonglian, Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan, educators Tao Zhixing and Shu Xincheng, newspaper figures Pan Gongzhan, and other male and female guests and students going abroad, totaling more than two hundred people, making it the largest farewell to students going abroad in recent years. A record of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Opening of the Meeting: After various circles arrived around 4:00, a group photo was taken first, and then the opening of the meeting was announced. The situation was as follows: (1) Ringing the bell to open the meeting; (2) Playing music; (3) Chairman Mayor Wu delivering the opening speech; (4) Ms. Yao Jinxin's piano solo; (5) US Consul General Ke Yinhang's speech; (6) Dai Cuilun playing the violin and Ms. Li Xianmin playing the piano together; (7) Director Xu Peihuang's speech; (8) Ms. Li Xianmin's piano solo; (9) Tao Zhixing's speech; (10) Ms. Cai Wenyi and two other ladies singing "Little Soldiers"; (11) Speeches by guests Mr. Hehe, the editor of the North-China Daily News, Mr. Anna, the US Commercial Counselor, and Mr. Li Zhaobin, the President of Jiaotong University; (12) Reply speech by Mr. Chen Renbing, the representative of the students going abroad; (13) Zhu Shaoping's report on the preparation situation. Tea and refreshments were served during the meeting, and the Public Security Bureau Band provided entertainment. The event ended happily near 7:00.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Our country's dispatch of students to study abroad has always lacked a consistent policy and a certain standard, so that talents and needs cannot be adapted. The reason for this is that we do not understand the current situation of the country, the truth of society, and even more do not know the preparations for various academics that should be in line with the world trend. Now the national crisis is becoming more and more urgent, like a patient whose symptoms have gradually become clear. All of you have solid academic training, and you should be deeply stimulated by the national crisis in recent years. This time you are going abroad to study, you must all have the purpose of saving the country. Critics ridicule studying abroad for the sake of vanity as "gilding," but I say that you are going abroad to "dispense medicine" for the sake of saving the country. Because the national situation is like this, the so-called policy and standard of studying abroad do not need to be formulated by the state, but all of you who have received considerable education must be able to choose it yourselves. In the future, you will all return to the country as emergency medicines, the so-called "accumulating wormwood for three years."</p>
<p>Encouragement from Various Circles: (1) Director of Education Xu Peihuang's speech encouraged all students going abroad to study what is practical and useful, and to develop among the people in the future, instead of concentrating in cities. (2) Tao Zhixing's speech stated that the failure of students studying abroad in the past was due to reading dead books, reading books to death, and dying after reading books. In the future, we must use both hands and brains. China is a country created by farmers, and what we learn in the future should contribute to the 85% of farmers in China, transform the countryside, create a good old foundation for China, save the country, relieve disasters, and solve the problem of the Eastern Province. (3) US Consul General Ke Yinhang encouraged all students to pay attention to practical learning and integrate with the society of the country they are in. (4) Mr. Hehe, the editor of the North-China Daily News, and Mr. Anna, the US Commercial Counselor, also provided many words of encouragement. (5) Li Zhaohuan, the President of Jiaotong University, gave a speech saying that this trip should strive to promote Chinese culture so that European and American countries can understand the truth of our country.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Shaoping, the director of the Global China Student Association, made a brief report after the speeches of all the students going abroad: (1) All students studying abroad must gather at the Global China Student Association tomorrow (that is, today) morning to discuss everything; (2) Today we are very grateful to the mayor for allowing us to hold the meeting here. The batch of students, about forty people, are scheduled to set sail directly to the United States on the President Stephen ship at about 4:00 this afternoon.</p>

<p>Two One Branch Talk</p>
<h3>Autumn Tiger</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The autumn tiger, which has the name of a tiger but not its form, and the ferocity of a tiger but not its appearance, is dancing and active again in this sound of bidding farewell to summer and welcoming coolness!</p>
<p>The word "tiger" represents fierceness. Above tigers, there are lion big brothers among fierce beasts. However, due to the regional problem of origin, Chinese people rarely see lions and are only afraid of tigers. Fierce women are called tigresses, and people who have a gentle appearance but are fierce at heart are called smiling tigers. Ink rubbings of steles and inscriptions that are priced exceptionally harshly are called black tigers. Ordinary things that are treated as rare commodities are called tiger meat. There are also other kinds of intangible tigers, which cannot be verified in detail. In short, the word "tiger" is a synonym for fierceness.</p>
<p>Without asking, one knows that the three words "autumn tiger" are used to describe the scorching heat of autumn. However, the scorching heat of midsummer is greater than the heat of autumn. Why not call it a "summer tiger"? Some people say: The scorching heat of midsummer is natural, and there is no need to establish a name like "summer tiger." Only when autumn arrives, clearly posting slogans to overthrow the scorching heat, and everyone hopes for the golden wind to send coolness and the jade dew to welcome coolness, but unexpectedly the heat of autumn is more than that of midsummer! Everyone has a sense of disappointment, so they say in unison: The terrible autumn tiger!</p>
<p>In fact, there is no need to be afraid of the autumn tiger. What is to be feared is the tiger of all seasons, and there is no need to be afraid of the tiger of one place, but what is to be feared is the tiger all over the place! What are the tigers of all seasons and the tigers all over the place? The answer is recorded in the Tan Gong above, said by the second Mr. Kong: Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger!</p>
<p>The people only seek to be spared the oppression of oppressive government and are already immensely grateful. What is there to be afraid of this local autumn tiger running rampant? What is there to be afraid of?</p>
<h3>Interpretation of Suzhou Proverbs</h3>
<p>— Fan Niu Weng</p>
<p>Seven Pagodas, Eight Memorial Columns, Nine Steamed Buns There are seven pagodas inside and outside Suzhou City, such as Tiger Hill Pagoda, on Tiger Hill outside Changmen; Fangshan Pagoda, on Zhixing Mountain outside Xu Men; Twin Pagodas, in Dinghui Temple inside Fengmen, also known as Twin Pagodas Temple, which was the examination hall of Wu County in the imperial examination era; White Pagoda, in Lindun Lane in the east city; Ruiguang Pagoda, in front of the Beamless Hall of Ruiguang Temple in Panmen, with an inscription written by Wen Zhenmeng, the Zhuangyuan of Changzhou in the Ming Dynasty; North Temple Pagoda, also known as Baoen Pagoda, in the north of the city, built by Sun Quan in the sixth year of Chiwu in the Wu Dynasty to repay his mother's kindness, supervised by Huang Gai, Jiang Qin, Ding Feng, Zhou Tai, Cheng Pu, and others. There used to be a broken stele in the weeds, which Fan Niu scraped together in the summer of the thirtieth year. There are separate records of the memorial columns, which are shaped like small and low pagodas. They are solid brick structures with no hollow space. According to the elders, people in ancient times were kind and honest. If they found lost items on the road, they would place them under the memorial columns and wait for the losers to come and claim them. They would not take what did not belong to them. I have only seen three memorial columns in Suzhou in my fifty years. One is in front of the Orphanage, one is in Weidao Temple, and one is at the bridgehead of Lianxi Lane. Few people know about the other five memorial columns. Steamed buns are not food snacks, but bathhouses for bathing. Because the roof of the building is round, like the top of a steamed bun, it is called a steamed bun. There used to be one in Sangye Lane, but it was sold to Zhang Shen ten years ago and converted into an ancestral hall. There are no nine steamed buns left.</p>
<p>Wu Qu Lane to See the Festivals Changmen Nei, left of Gao Bo Tong Bridge, is Wu Qu Lane, the former residence of Tang Bohu, the talented scholar of the Ming Dynasty, also known as Layman Liuru. Therefore, Bohu's paintings are inscribed with "Tang Yin of Wu Qu." At the north end of the lane, the shops are densely packed. Suzhou originally had three festival fairs every year.</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai's Hat and Ma Fulu</h3>
<p>Hats and horses are ordinary things, but General Cai Tingkai's hat and horse are worthy of our description and praise because of the person's name.</p>
<p>Since General Cai went to Fujian, the most eye-catching thing was the general's woolen hat, which was the color of snuff and extremely old and worn, with specks of dust on it. The general always took it with him and frequently raised this old and worn hat to show his gratitude to people. Someone asked him strangely, and the general said, "This is the hat I wore when I commanded the war of resistance against Japan in Shanghai."</p>
<p>The dust on it is like the bullet marks on a battle flag, leaving a memorial, so I don't want to discard it, and it is also to never forget. The commentators said that his hat and Washington's shoes and Lincoln's pen are equally beautiful tales.</p>
<p>In addition to this precious hat, General Cai also has a horse that is also very precious. The horse has a majestic body and shiny fur. It is a thousand-mile steed. During the Shanghai war, it was used by the general to gallop through the rain of bullets and build up great achievements. It is said that this horse was obtained from the battle against Feng Yuxiang the year before last. His clan table arrived in Jinan and fought with Shi Yousan. This horse was obtained from the Shi army. According to legend, only Cai can ride this horse. If others ride it, it will roar and leap wildly. The commentators then praised this horse and Guan Zhuangmiao's Red Hare for their beauty.</p>
<p>Qingming, the seventh month of the lunar calendar, and the first day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar are the Shangyuan, Zhongyuan, and Xiayuan festivals. On this day, the land and grain gods, temple administrators, incense fire officials, etc., must decorate the flags and umbrellas, widely recruit gongs and drums, and carry the mud statues and official robes out of the city to the Li Altar on Tiger Hill to preside over the sacrifice to the lonely souls. It is a grand festival inside and outside the city, such as King Jiaorang, King Wai'anqi, King Li'anqi, King Zhou Xiang, Jiang Taigong, Wu Zixu, Lord Chunshen Huang Xie, Luo Yin, the god of dysentery, Ren Fang, the god of eyes, Jiang Ziwu, the little weaving department official, Liu Yi, the water fairy, Zhu Jun, the land of the school field, and Pan Yuanshao, the princess consort of Liwa Township. (Pan was the beloved son-in-law of Zhang Shicheng, the King of Gusu.) In total, there are thirty-six events for the gods of the three counties of one prefecture and the social associations. The scholars, women, children, and old people in the city must go to the entrance of Wu Qu Lane on this day to wait. Wu Qu Lane is the only way for each grand festival, so it is said that "Wu Qu Lane to see the festivals." "Old people" is what Suzhou people call those who have waited for a long time. This custom gradually subsided at the end of the Qing Dynasty. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the three festival fairs were abolished and unheard of.</p>
<h3>Women and Cosmetics</h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>If someone used colors to paint a rose flower to make it more vivid, everyone would laugh at him as a fool. But if a very beautiful woman does not show herself in her original appearance, but adds some artificial touches to make her more enchanting, people still think it is a matter of course and say something like "loving beauty is human nature." Perhaps this contains a mysterious philosophical meaning. In fact, the result is nothing more than the development of the cosmetics industry and the invention of various novel cosmetic techniques.</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, the British Parliament passed a resolution: "From now on, all women, regardless of their social class, must abide by this resolution and must not use strong perfumes, apply grease and powder, wear dentures, wear wigs, wear rings or circles, wear high heels, or use corsets and other artificial cosmetic techniques to increase their attractiveness to attract men; otherwise, they will be severely punished." At that time, many new-style prisons were indeed built to house these beautiful women. However, Queen Anne Elisabeth and the general royal relatives not only violated the resolution, but also lavishly bathed in French wine and milk.</p>
<p>Like these red rouges, fragrant powders, blood-like lipsticks, nail polishes, face-washing soaps, perfumes sprinkled on the body, and all kinds of eyebrow pencils and other artificial cosmetics, they have never disappointed women from ancient times to the present, but they are now more scientific and artistic. For example, ordinary bananas can be used as fragrances, and wool can be used as raw materials for snow creams. In short, the manufacture of a cosmetic, first, should make women: whether old ladies or little girls: all love to use; second, it should not harm the skin, and the raw materials must be pure; third, it must be improved from time to time, or reinvented as a new invention, so as not to make women feel disgusted.</p>
<p>A cosmetics expert said: "After a woman puts on makeup, standing in front of the mirror, looking left and right, she must make herself look younger and more attractive. She feels very beautiful, and feels from the depths of her heart that she has already surpassed the natural, and is willing to send her, after a series of artificial manufacturing, to society to compete with other women. Especially at night, under the dim lights or pale moonlight, the artificial beauty is enough to make you suffer. But, if you get her gift, when you wake up tomorrow morning, looking at her in your arms, ah, what have you finally realized?: Hypocrisy, ah! Hypocrisy!"</p>
<p>Women, poor women, hypocritical women, is such makeup, turning you into artificial beauty, your virtue? Is it your victory that you win the faith of others without your original selves? But why do men love women with external beauty and not pay attention to the inner beauty of women? This, the reason why women love cosmetics as their lives and use artificial beauty to make themselves more delicate and moving, may be the sins of men. However, this is always an incomprehensible mystery: women and cosmetics.</p>
<h3>Capital Nights</h3>
<p>— Lin Yulu</p>
<p>Shanghai nights. So bustling. So mysterious. The capital is a new metropolis. Although not as prosperous as Shanghai, the mystery of its night scene is enough to pique one's interest. Having resided here for over a month, this reporter will depict the scene as it is. At dusk, the renowned Taiping Road and Confucius Temple present scenes as lively as North Sichuan Road and the City God Temple in Shanghai. As you stroll alone on Taiping Road, the red and green lights illuminate the enormous advertisements. The roadsides are lined with grand stores, displaying a variety of goods, and the bright lights attract numerous male and female customers. Many women can be seen on the wide steps, dressed more simply than in Shanghai, though still sensual, but certainly not as flamboyant. Short-sleeved turned-down collars, bare feet in white shoes, and black short skirts are the standard uniform for female students, common throughout the city.</p>
<p>Standing before the Confucius Temple, you'll catch the aroma of powder and meat. Although Nanjing has no officially sanctioned or private brothels, there are many "singing but not selling" songstresses performing on stages in tea houses. Melancholy souls crowd the halls, offering support and requesting performances, filled with excitement. As for true indulgence, of course, there are other avenues, but these are forbidden by the police, thus only regulars are privy. Your humble servant has heard tales of this from friends, beyond which I am ignorant.</p>
<p>In this sleepless city, there are many havens for cooling off. The most unforgettable must be the Qinhuai River and Xuanwu Lake. From the small park at the Confucius Temple, one can hire a painted boat to glide gently along the Qinhuai River. Aboard, you can drink alone, or when feeling down, summon a songstress to sing a few tunes. There are boats on the Qinhuai River dedicated to singing, each carrying two or three songstresses, and small food boats that frequently come by to solicit business. On the river, you can enjoy listening to nightingales singing love songs in delicate voices. Jing opera melodies, Yangzhou tunes—you can say they have everything. Even in the deep quiet of the night, the small Qinhuai River remains filled with painted boats. More serene, more expansive, and more delightful than the Qinhuai River is Xuanwu Lake. The entirety of Xuanwu Lake is now designated as Five Continents Park. I believe that Liwa Chestnut Village and Hongkou Park in Shanghai also have shimmering waters and moonlight, but they don't compare to this place. The vast area of Xuanwu Lake is divided into five small island-like continents, hence the name "Five Continents" for the park. Here, lush bamboo groves and dense tree canopies reveal quiet, natural beauty everywhere. Thus, refined scholars have given it the elegant name "Virgin Park." Xuanwu is even more beautiful at night. There are also small painted boats, but absolutely no traces of songstresses. There are also small rowboats for hire. Steering a small boat to float in the heart of Xuanwu, the wide expanse of water makes one unaware of the crowded painted boats. Looking up, you see the bright moon; looking down, you also see the bright moon. A gentle breeze ripples the lake surface, and lights shine on the water, forming a bright and shimmering line. The reflections of drooping willows line the winding lake paths, and passing under small bridges reveals different scenes at every turn. In the middle of the lake, one can sometimes hear the melodious sounds of a violin, and on the opposite shore, one might glimpse a couple embracing in a small boat. The reflection on the water would make any bachelor envious and jealous. If one could hold a cup in hand, it would make you forget everything, forget yourself, and feel almost like an immortal. Would you still think of returning? Ah, mysterious are the capital's nights. How many fortunate people dream poetic dreams in your embrace?</p>

<h3>Last Week's Gold Market in Financials Continued to Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Last week's spot gold happened to coincide with swap deals, so only the initial day of September saw market activity. Opening at 732 taels, it surged 6.4 taels, due to the continued contraction of the silver market. Subsequently, as dealers had privately opened swap deals a day in advance, the premium narrowed, initially to 6 taels, then frequently decreased to only 3 taels, with bulls still paying the premium. Major bulls like Yuanxing Yong were willing to swap out, and spot goods seemed sufficient. Furthermore, as short sellers were in the majority, market prices suddenly weakened, plunging 10 taels. On the 16th, the official opening for futures trading was even cheaper, calculated at 6 mace, even with bulls once briefly posting a loss of 1 or 2 candareens, eventually settling at a premium of 6 mace. Consequently, the market price abruptly fell to 705 taels and 8 mace, closing at 09 taels and 4 mace. The 22.6 tael decline over two days, compared to the previous week, resulted in a further drop of 16.2 taels. Opening for October at 718 and a half taels, the silver market rebounded that day, and both official and unofficial exchange rates in Shanghai loosened, causing an immediate drop to 05 and a half taels. Afterwards, the trend hovered, and the waves were relatively calm. When the silver market contracted again, conditions improved, exceeding 720 taels. However, as domestic and international silver markets and exchange rates seemed to diverge, the gold market weakened. Although it briefly rose to 724 and a half taels on Thursday, it returned to the 20-tael mark by the weekend, ending at 17 taels. This five-day period saw a difference of 21 taels, and the difference between opening and closing was a decrease of 1.5 taels. Overall, it has fallen for four consecutive weeks, totaling approximately 30 taels. The recent gold trading chips are estimated at approximately 22,000 units, with major firms holding slightly more long positions. However, the excess held by major players like Yuanxing Yong has decreased compared to before. The short positions, like Hengxing's, were larger, and Yuanmao Yong also had over 1,000 short positions, mostly from those who had not completed their swaps in September, now only about 2,000 units. The divergence between overseas silver markets and local exchange rates, with British and American silver prices rising for three consecutive weeks in the opposite direction, has since slightly decreased. However, HSBC's listed British and American exchange rates have increased by half a notch. Internally, the trends diverged, with British rates contracting and American rates increasing, but the numbers were small, roughly 125 each. Gold businesses are generally focusing on covering their positions to offset previous shorts. Also, given the expected rise in gold prices, they are wary of losses and have already cashed out. The initial settlement price for US dollars was around 60 taels, which later reached over 80 taels, and then fluctuated around 70 taels. The open market was relatively stable, around 19 taels. The spot gold market paused this week, as the Central Bank rarely absorbed gold due to unfavorable prices. Here is a list of the high and low silver market exchange rates and spot gold prices for the week:</p>
<p>Type | Highest | Lowest | Change from Previous Saturday</p>

<h3>Rapid Surge in the Interest Rate Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to active buying by money houses, market prices rose even further. The morning rate was 6 candareens 9 fen 1 li, and the afternoon rate was 1 li 7 hao 5. As a result, the morning market rose 2 candareens 6 hao 25 compared to the previous day. The silver call rate in the morning was 8 fen better, and the afternoon rate decreased slightly by 2 fen, resulting in 6 fen. Transactions for foreign currency remittance drafts totaled 630,000, and only 30,000 in paper money in the morning. Call money transactions were over 6 million. Due to bank holidays, money shops received over 3.7 million in foreign currency notes and over 21 million in silver notes. Remittances from various sources totaled over 300,000. Small money shops transacted over 500,000. The exchange rate for subsidiary currency, Jiangnan small foreign coins, was 6 candareens in both the morning and afternoon, with only 3,500 jiao transacted in the morning.

<h3>Last Week's Bond Market Wavered with Slight Increases</h3>
<p>Last week's situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed that spot trading remained sparse, with only 47,000 yuan transacted in total. The futures market was slightly more active compared to the previous week, but the market remained sluggish. Major players remained aloof as before, and market transactions were sporadic. However, the September market was gradually becoming active due to swap deals. The total turnover was 19.82 million yuan, an increase of over 4.3 million yuan compared to the previous week. With the chaotic political situation, market sentiment was unsettled, and supply and demand conditions changed frequently. Market prices fluctuated and were quite chaotic, as the rise and fall of each price depended solely on the momentary supply and demand conditions, without any consistent trend. Buying was more active in the market, and prices rose across the board. Among them, "Disbandment Bonds" rose nearly 1.5 yuan, while other bonds rose by about 1 yuan. On Tuesday, they fell back by 7 or 8 jiao, and on Wednesday, they rose again by 6 or 7 jiao, while on Tuesday they rose or fell by a small number of jiao to about 1 yuan. For the first two days of the week, fluctuations were slightly higher, but the fluctuations were very small. Overall, prices were slightly firmer compared to the previous week, with increases outweighing the declines. Spot prices for the Sixth Consolidated Loan, Series 6, spot for the 20 Customs Consolidated Tax Bonds, Financial Bonds, etc., rose by an average of over 1 yuan, while other bonds rose by several jiao to 7 or 8 jiao. Only spot for the 96 Loan, Series 96, and the current month futures for the Compilation and Remittance of Foreign Troops 19 Customs Bonds were slightly weaker. Spot for the 19 Customs Philanthropic Bonds fell by 3.5 yuan compared to mid-July. The bond market trend was as chaotic as before, and it was said that the Securities Exchange had resumed full-day trading starting last Wednesday. The price changes for each bond during the week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn Market Sees Many Bulls, Trading Floor Dried Up</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn sales have been sluggish for the past week. All merchant groups are lacking vitality because domestic economic conditions are still difficult to ease. Purchasing power is weak. Also, many parties processed a lot in the previous month. As a result, it is now more lonely. Moreover, prices have risen 16 taels compared to when they were lower. All traders are buying September and October futures, indicating a speculative nature on the part of the customers. It is also a plan to prepare for the future. However, domestic goods from each factory are currently in short supply, so it's difficult to see the market falling. Rongxing, a major firm, is extremely enthusiastic, and is still buying more on dips. The amount of its sole proprietary account is over 17,000 bales. In addition, Changfeng also has 10,000 bales. These two have about 30,000 bales, an amount that is locked up, so the trading floor is naturally dry. The intention is based on the fact that this year's conditions are good in all regions, autumn sales will be strong, and that the price of American cotton is stable. With these two major reasons, the bullish sentiment is very strong. The market goes up when there is a dip. The yarn price for the week rose by 1 tael 7.8 candareens compared to the previous week. The total turnover for the week was 132,950 bales. Most of the customers were from Changsha and Sichuan, followed by others. The total for the week was only 4,863 bales, including 625 bales from fellow merchants. Prices rose by about 1 tael. The breakdown of purchases by merchant group is listed below:</p>
<p>Merchant Group | Bales |</p>
<p>---|---|</p>
<p>Guangdong | 647 |</p>
<p>Jiangxi | 10 |</p>
<p>Changsha | 1,065 |</p>
<p>Inland | 195 |</p>

<h3>This Month's Cotton Rose by 2 Taels and 1 Mace</h3>
<p>Cotton mills need to be more active.</p>
<p>The cotton market has been reaching daily highs for the past week, and the situation is very promising. Speculators are generally bullish. The price of American cotton is stable, the gold market has not fallen sharply, and there is no reliable information about the new domestic cotton. Therefore, buyers are very eager to buy, and they are buying more when the market dips. However, one manufacturer is vigorously selling off, and the number of bales is very large. The opinion is that the new cotton harvest will be abundant due to this year's favorable rainfall. Therefore, there is a tendency to sell off new cotton. Despite the large amount of sales, they have been absorbed by speculators, so the market is rising. As for the new cotton situation, according to a survey by the China Cotton Production Statistics Association, there are approximately over 10,500,000 dan, an increase of over 4,000,000 dan compared to last year. This quantity is the largest harvest since 1919. For the past week, transactions have totaled 500,600 dan. The prices for each month are up 9 mace 5 fen from the previous week. However, the August prices, which are a transitional period, have risen by 2 taels and 1 mace due to the lack of delivery. The current amount of cotton in the mills is more active. The price of American cotton is up 15 "impediments" compared to the previous week. The amounts of current cotton purchased by each manufacturer are listed below:</p>
<p>Flower Name | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Volume Traded | Term |</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>New Fire Engine Flower | 30.50 | - | 200 Bales | September/October Delivery |</p>

<h3>First Estimate Report of National Cotton Production in the 21st Year Released by the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced the first estimate of national cotton production in the 21st year at 5 PM on August 20, 2022, as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area: 37,086,775 mu</p>
<p>Ginned Cotton Production: 10,829,162 dan</p>
<p>The above estimates are based on: (1) Reports from the eleven provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang; (2) The cotton crop conditions up to August 14; (3) Losses from disasters suffered by cotton crops in each province before August 14 have already been calculated; (4) Cotton fields are in mu, and cotton production is in dan.</p>
<p>The following compares this year's first estimate with historical cotton field production:</p>
<p>Year | Cotton Field Area | Ginned Cotton Production |</p>
<p>---|---|---|</p>
<p>1919 | 33,037,881 | 9,028,390 |</p>
<p>1920 | 28,327,297 | 6,750,403 |</p>
<p>1921 | 28,216,168 | 5,429,220 |</p>
<p>1922 | 33,464,595 | 8,310,355 |</p>
<p>1923 | 29,554,053 | 7,144,642 |</p>
<p>1924 | 28,771,577 | 7,808,882 |</p>
<p>1925 | 28,121,027 | 7,534,351 |</p>
<p>1926 | 27,349,727 | 6,243,585 |</p>
<p>1927 | 27,610,276 | 6,722,108 |</p>
<p>1928 | 31,926,311 | 8,839,274 |</p>
<p>1929 | 33,811,255 | 7,587,021 |</p>
<p>1930, First Estimate | 37,593,012 | 8,809,567 |</p>
<p>1931, First Estimate | 35,468,352 | 6,793,241 |</p>
<p>Second Estimate | 34,182,747 | 6,460,641 |</p>
<p>Final Revised | 31,637,779 | 6,399,780 |</p>
<p>1932, First Estimate | 37,086,775 | 10,829,162 |</p>
<p>The average condition of this year's national cotton production can be described as relatively stable. Compared to 1931, this is a bumper crop. In 1931, only the north was better, while the main cotton-producing areas in the Yangtze River basin, Jiangsu and Hubei, experienced unprecedented crop failures. This year, the climate was not necessarily good, but it was significantly better than in 1931, especially in the north. Cotton crops in the northern provinces are most susceptible to drought. In the past few years, China's poor cotton harvests were mainly due to crop failures in the north caused by drought. This year, except for a few areas that did not receive enough rain, the amount of rain in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan was excessive, even causing flooding. In the flooded areas, cotton crops were naturally damaged, but the area was very small, and most cotton-growing areas were good. In Shaanxi, although it rained once, it was still dry and suffered hail damage, resulting in lower production than in 1931. All other provinces had increased production. In recent years, there has been less banditry in Hebei, and rural social conditions have been roughly stable. Cotton cultivation has also made slight progress, and the field production has almost doubled this year. Shandong is most suitable for cotton cultivation in terms of soil and climate, and cotton harvests have been abundant in recent years. Henan has traditionally been known for cotton cultivation. Due to frequent wars and natural disasters, cotton production has been greatly reduced. This year, the rainfall was appropriate, and the harvest was more abundant. In the south, 1931 suffered from floods, while 1932 had the opposite problem, suffering from drought. However, the cotton crop conditions were ultimately better than in 1931, as the cotton harvest in 1931 fell to a very low limit. The yield per mu in Jiangsu Province was less than 10 jin in 1931, and over 4 million mu in Hubei Province were submerged and completely failed. Therefore, although there was a drought this year, the production has doubled compared to 1931. In recent years, cotton cultivation in Hunan Province has progressed rapidly. It also suffered crop failures due to rain last year, and it has now returned to its old form. In total, the cotton production of the eleven provinces is estimated to be over 10 million dan, the highest number in recent years. The production amount seems very large, but in fact, the cotton field area has greatly increased compared to the past, and cotton crops rarely have a relatively good harvest. Generally, if the north is good, the south must be poor, as in 1931. Conversely, if the south is good, the north will be poor, as in 1929. The total amount of cotton produced has not increased until now. This year, cotton crops in the north are better, and the south is also expected to have a normal harvest. Therefore, the production amount has suddenly increased compared to the past few years. The cotton field area and ginned cotton production for each province in this estimate are compared with the final revised estimate for 1931 below:</p>
<p>Province | 1932 (This Estimate) | 1931 Revised Estimate |</p>
<p>---|---|---|</p>
<p>| | Cotton Field Area | Cotton Production | Cotton Field Area | Cotton Production |</p>
<p>Liaoning | - | - | 1,142,430 | 177,680 |</p>
<p>Hebei | 4,954,645 | 1,560,464 | 2,953,000 | 844,000 |</p>
<p>Shandong | 7,300,236 | 2,649,257 | 7,974,000 | 2,154,882 |</p>
<p>Shanxi | 3,437,848 | 1,118,348 | 3,488,778 | 781,728 |</p>

<p>Hubei | 7,568,210 | 2,706,640 | 4,284,260 | 1,037,002 |</p>
<p>Jiangxi | 2,159,286 | 237,646 | 1,278,920 | - |</p>
<p>Anhui | 529,490 | 590,134 | 629,004 | 430,500 |</p>
<p>Jiangsu | 8,504,829 | 1,716,731 | 7,656,244 | 1,626,480 |</p>
<p>Zhejiang | 1,607,700 | 493,058 | 1,841,873 | 398,834 |</p>
<p>Total | 37,086,775 | 10,829,162 | 31,637,779 | 6,399,780 |</p>
<p>This estimate was made during a time of intense heat, epidemics, banditry, and difficult travel. The north was also experiencing continuous rain and flash floods, making the survey particularly difficult. Fortunately, each province worked hard to complete the task on schedule. However, although Liaoning Province had sent surveyors, they were unable to complete their work due to many obstacles. Therefore, it was not included. The second estimate for this year is scheduled to be released on December 15.</p>

<h3>The British-Owned Bus Strike Became More Serious Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gunshots Heard on Rue du Lieutenant Foch, No One Injured</p>
<p>Workers Arrested, Chinese Police Escort Buses for Protection</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: "Since the implementation of the bus workers' strike, although party and government agencies have attempted mediation, the company's attitude has been resolute, offering no hope of a resolution. Yesterday morning, a Route 9 bus was driving on Rue du Lieutenant Foch when someone suddenly fired a gun, attacking the bus. Fortunately, no one was injured. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Gunfire Disturbance: At approximately 10:00 AM yesterday morning, a Route 9 bus was traveling on Rue du Lieutenant Foch near the Chengdu Road intersection when a figure resembling a worker, dressed in blue cloth shirt and pants, riding a bicycle, followed behind the bus. He immediately pulled out a handgun and fired directly into the bus. The bullets pierced both sides of the bus, but fortunately, due to the few passengers, no one was injured, although they were greatly frightened. Upon hearing the alarm, the French police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to pursue the assailant, but he had already taken the opportunity to escape. Furthermore, at 2:00 PM, a Route 1 bus was surrounded by striking workers on Hart Road, who damaged the engine parts. When a Route 9 bus drove to Route Marco Polo, someone threw buckets of feces, watermelons, and stones into the bus, damaging two pieces of glass. A similar incident also occurred when a Route 10 bus drove to Yangshupu Road."</p>
<p>Workers Detained: At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a ticket seller, No. 34, was walking near the Great World amusement center when he was seen by detectives. Due to his suspicious behavior, he was arrested and sent to the Songshan Road Police Station. At the same time, a ticket seller, No. 199, was arrested near the Dongxin Bridge and taken to the Xinzha Police Station.</p>
<p>Protection for Bus Operation: Since the restoration of routes, there have been numerous disturbances, causing passengers to hesitate. Yesterday, a shooting incident occurred. The company has specifically requested the police to assign one plainclothes Chinese police officer, carrying a handgun, to each bus for protection, in order to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Company Reward: The British-owned China General Omnibus Company authorities, due to the repeated disturbances that have occurred since the ticket sellers went on strike, will offer forty yuan in silver to anyone who can arrest a worker causing trouble on the spot.</p>
<h3>Workers of Three Foreign Telegraph Companies Demand Wage Increase</h3>
<p>Deadline for Reply Today</p>
<p>The delivery workers of the three foreign companies in this city, Great Northern Telegraph Company, Great Eastern Telegraph Company, and Pacific Commercial Telegraph Company, have initiated a labor strike due to demands for increased wages. They have submitted six conditions and have given the company authorities until today (the 22nd) to reply; otherwise, all will resign voluntarily. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Background: The three telegraph companies, Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Commercial, are all located at 4 Avenue Edward VII. The total number of telegraph delivery workers in these three companies is seventy-seven. Among them, the highest monthly wage is twenty-nine yuan, and the lowest is only eighteen yuan. With the rising cost of living, they all feel that their income is insufficient. Therefore, on the night of the 15th of this month, they gathered to hold a general meeting, demanding that the management be presented with conditions for a wage increase. On the following day (the 16th), they submitted six conditions in writing. On the 19th, they sent a second letter to the company authorities, setting a deadline for a reply by the 22nd; otherwise, all would voluntarily resign.</p>
<p>Demanded Conditions: The seventy-seven messengers of the three companies wrote to the management of the three companies, stating: "Due to the increasingly high cost of living and the exorbitant prices of all commodities, our colleagues' income is insufficient to sustain their lives. We respectfully request that you generously agree to the following conditions, for which we would be deeply grateful. Please reply immediately." Attached are the conditions: "(1) Starting from August of this year, wages must first be increased. We request a uniform wage increase of eight yuan, and then an annual increase of four yuan thereafter. (2) We request double wages at the end of the year. (3) If anyone unintentionally violates company rules and is dismissed, they must be compensated based on their years of service with the company, with one month's wage paid for each year. (4) If anyone resigns voluntarily or is dismissed by the company without cause, or if someone is dismissed by the company due to old age, they must be compensated based on their years of service with the company, with two months' wages paid for each year. (5) If someone is injured while serving, resulting in disability that prevents them from working, their wages must continue to be paid monthly until death. If someone dies, their family must be provided with a three-year pension calculated by wage. (6) The daily work hours are limited to eight hours. This rule does not apply to days when the offices are closed." Company Attitude: After the workers presented their conditions, the company authorities stated that the general manager, Peng Sun, was avoiding the summer heat in Japan and could not be held responsible for a response. The assistant manager, Aiterson, stated that he did not have the authority to accept these conditions. Therefore, it is unlikely that a response will be given today. The workers may take action tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Double Palace Silk Factory Workers Strike</h3>
<p>Only One of the City's Seven Factories is Operating</p>
<p>Cause: Demand for Wage Increase</p>
<p>There are seven Double Palace Silk Factories in this city, including Honglun, Xinlun, Jinglun, Ruilun, Yonglun, and Fulun. They were completely shut down when the Shanghai War started. Since the restoration of order in Shanghai, due to the economic downturn and poor business, only the Fulun Factory at the end of Tianbao Road, with a total of 440 machines, has managed to open 216 machines, employing 352 workers. From the day before yesterday, all the workers at this factory suddenly went on strike. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden Strike: The wages of workers in Double Palace Silk Factories were five jiao and three fen when Single Palace Factories paid six jiao. After the Shanghai Incident, when work resumed, wages were changed to four jiao and two fen, the same as the military factories. This year, workers in Single Palace Factories went on strike to demand a wage increase, and after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the wage was set at four jiao and five fen. The Double Palace Factories subsequently increased the wages of some of their workers to four jiao and five fen. The workers at all the Double Palace Factories suddenly went on strike the day before yesterday, without formally requesting anything from the factory beforehand and without negotiating with the factory afterward.</p>
<p>Ambiguous Attitude: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency went to the factory to inquire. According to the factory manager, the Double Palace Silk Factories are almost entirely closed down, business remains poor, and it is difficult to maintain even the current situation. Forty to sixty-sixty-textured silks are selling for 320-330 taels. If the workers have demands, they hope that representatives will come to negotiate, and the factory will be able to accept and discuss them within its capabilities. According to news from the workers' side, the demand is for improved treatment and the restoration of wages to four jiao and five fen across the board.</p>
<h3>Fourth Day of Hunger Strike by Sanyou Factory Workers</h3>
<p>General Labor Union Sends Personnel to Force-Feed Milk</p>
<p>Company Suddenly Locks Down Water Supply</p>
<p>All Sectors Expressing Active Assistance</p>
<p>Twenty-three Sanyou Factory workers, including Hong Jiaben, have been on a hunger strike since it was implemented, and yesterday was the fourth day. Because there is still no hope of a resolution, they continue to refuse to eat. The City General Labor Union, believing that the workers' lives are in danger, has sent personnel to force-feed them. As a result, the workers reluctantly drank a small amount of milk. The company suddenly stopped providing water yesterday morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forceful Encouragement to Drink Milk: General Labor Union representatives Shao Lubai, Zhou Xuexiang, and Ye Xianggao arrived at the Sanyou General Factory at 12:00 PM. After more than ten attempts at persuasion failed, the three representatives, Shao, Zhou, and Ye, considering that the hunger-striking workers had been fasting for four days, without a drop of water, and that their lives were in extreme danger, joined with personnel from the Seventh District Cotton Weaving Union to hold the workers' hands and feet and force-feed them with spoons. As a result, each of the hunger-striking members reluctantly drank a small amount of milk, stating that they would not resume eating next time until the dispute was resolved. Relocation of Hunger-Striking Workers: The hunger-striking workers were previously lying in the cool yarn room. Representatives from the party and government agencies and the General Labor Union, believing that the air in the room was polluted and would exacerbate the workers' suffering, managed to move them into a room next to the factory's office on the previous evening.</p>
<p>Condition of Workers in the Hospital: After workers Hong Jiaben, Shen Yucheng, Zhang Zegang, Hou Zhangyuan, etc. were sent to the Labor Hospital, they refused to take even medicine from yesterday onward. The hospital doctors decided to administer medication through injections. Water Supply Locked Down: At approximately 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the Public Concession Yangshupu Fire Brigade suddenly dispatched three steelworkers to the Sanyou Industrial Society's General Factory in Yinxianggang to lock down all the factory's own fire hydrant faucets with lead wire. However, the workers need to draw water from these for daily drinking, washing clothes, and bathing. The sudden closure of the water supply caused widespread panic. Zhang Yihai, the executive director of the Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, upon hearing the news, went to the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District, requesting that he inquire with the Fire Brigade about the reason for the closure. He dispatched Patrol Chief He Xiangfa to Yangshupu Fire Brigade to inquire about the truth. As a result, the Fire Brigade stated that they were acting on the orders of the Municipal Council. The newly appointed head of the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District, Wang Qintang, believing that the matter concerned public safety, has taken steps to negotiate and thoroughly investigate the reason for the closure.</p>
<p>Widespread Condolences and Support: Yesterday, various groups who went to express condolences and support, in addition to General Labor Union representatives Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, and Ye Xianggao,</p>
<p>also included representatives from the Steamboat Industry Labor Union, the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Tea Room Labor Union, the Tea Labor Union, the Musical Instrument Labor Union, the Joint Association of Shanghai East District Yarn Factories, the Newspaper Labor Union, and others.</p>
<p>General Labor Union Hosts Banquet for Various Sectors: The Shanghai General Labor Union hosted a banquet at 3:00 PM yesterday on the ninth floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge to entertain various public organizations, including the Law Society, the Joint Association of National Salvation Groups, the Citizens' Federation, the Nanjing Road Business Association, the National Postal Workers' General Union, and over fifty other organizations. Representatives such as Shen Junru, Ren Zhongheng, Wang Jian'e, Zhang Zilian, and Zhang Yichen, as well as over sixty reporters from various newspapers, were present. Zhu Xuefan, a standing committee member of the General Labor Union, first reported on the Sanyou Factory dispute and the tragic situation of the workers' hunger strike, requesting that all sectors stand on humanitarian grounds, uphold justice, and offer deep sympathy and assistance. Subsequently, representatives Shen Junru, Zhang Zilian, and Ren Zhongheng, among others, expressed their views, stating that they deeply sympathized with the Sanyou Factory workers' hunger strike over demands for reinstatement and that the employers were disregarding them. They stated that if any unfortunate events were to occur in the future, the employers would be responsible both legally and morally, and they expressed their active support, adjourning the meeting at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Forced Feeding of Milk Again: After the General Labor Union entertained the various sectors, the representatives, believing that the workers had been on a hunger strike for four days and that although they had consumed some milk, their lives were still in danger, decided to send Shen Junru, Wang Jian'e, Shen Zuru, and others to the Sanyou Factory again, accompanied by General Labor Union representatives Yu Xianting and Chen Peide, to force-feed them. However, the workers kept their mouths tightly shut, so the representatives forcibly poured milk into them to prevent their lives from being endangered.</p>
<p>Announcing the History of Sanyou: The Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Union yesterday issued a written statement to inform all sectors about the history of Sanyou Industrial Society, stating: "Sanyou Industrial Society was founded by Shen Jiucheng, Chen Wanyun, and a Mr. Wang, hence the name 'Sanyou' (Three Friends). It started in the first year of the Republic, with a factory on Sichuan Road near Yokohama Bridge, manufacturing only cotton thread candle wicks, which were sold by the Whiteaway Laidlaw &amp; Co. candle factory. At that time, the capital was only over three hundred yuan. By the sixth year of the Republic, additional capital of sixty thousand yuan was raised, and it was organized as a limited liability company, weaving various towels. The Iron Anchor brand towels sold on the temporary market were very popular, eventually causing the disappearance of these imported goods from the market. In the seventh year of the Republic, the manufacturing plant was moved to Yinxianggang (the current general factory) for expansion, adding larger towels. In the tenth year of the Republic, additional capital of 200,000 yuan was raised to produce patterned towels. In the thirteenth year of the Republic, additional capital of 600,000 yuan was raised to produce single-width bedsheets, free cloth for cooking stoves, and various household cotton thread products. In the eighteenth year of the Republic, a branch factory was established in Hangzhou, and additional capital of 1,200,000 yuan was raised. In the twentieth year of the Republic, the capital was increased again by 800,000 yuan, bringing the total capital before and after to 2,000,000 yuan. However, the society's capital has been increased repeatedly, mostly through dividends. The society's profits over the years have been very substantial, with a surplus of over 321,800 yuan last year alone. Therefore, its business development is the best among Shanghai's factories. The Shanghai general factory has not yet resumed operations, while the Hangzhou branch factory is operating as usual, and the number of employees at the Hangzhou factory is twice that of the general factory. The capitalists are using the pretext of insufficient working capital and stockpiles of inventory, and their intentions are obviously fraudulent. Now, the manager, Shen Jiucheng, lives a life of luxury, traveling in cars, with a broad body and a smiling face, enjoying the happiness of the world, and hardly knows that there are suffering compatriots living a hellish life. Therefore, the workers who worked hard to create production in the past have been treated like discarded fans in autumn, not worth a glance. We have specially described the society's history, hoping that you will examine it carefully."</p>
<h3>Revision of the Shanghai Court Agreement Issue</h3>
<p>Judicial Yuan Sets October to Notify Various Countries</p>
<p>Japanese Side Contacts Various Countries to Obstruct Progress</p>
<p>The agreements for the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court in the Public Concession of this port, the Shanghai First Special District Court, the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court in the French Concession, and the Shanghai Second Special District Court will all expire in early April of next year. The Ministry of Judicial Administration is now preparing to contact the Consular Body to negotiate revision matters and has set October to notify various countries and hold meetings to discuss. Details were obtained yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Prior Notification to Various Countries: According to an authority in the judicial circle, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may notify various countries regarding the revision of the agreement before October, because according to the agreement's provisions, if the agreement expires and both parties agree, the term can be extended for three years. If it needs to be revised at that time, one party should notify all parties six months before the expiration date, and then it can be revised, so that various preparations for revision can be made within six months.</p>
<p>Court's Suggestions Submitted to the Ministry: According to Zhang Dachun, the chief clerk of the Second Branch of the Higher Court, the revision of the agreement by the Ministry of Judicial Administration is related to the court itself, but the court has not participated because it is a diplomatic issue. However, in order to contribute to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the court has submitted to the ministry the process of handling matters after recovery and various points that should be improved, so as to provide a basis for future revisions.</p>
<p>Future Negotiation Trends: The reporter further learned from other sources that although the agreement for the four courts is being revised, whether or not the progress will be smooth depends on political changes. At a time when the political situation is uncertain, there are great difficulties in the progress of this matter, and foreigners can easily use this point to obstruct it.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Intentionally Disrupting: Because the revision of the agreement will expand our country's rights over the courts in the Special District, such as the recovery of judicial police power and prosecutorial power, and the cancellation of the right of foreign lawyers to defend, the Japanese side is deliberately undermining it. After the Shanghai War, the Japanese side claimed that the Shanghai War was caused by the courts, which led to misunderstandings among foreigners. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese secretly contacted various countries to obstruct the revision of our court. The reporter asked Guo Huaipu, a judge of the Second Branch of the Higher Court, about this. Guo made an informal statement, saying that everything must follow the natural trend. For example, in the era of the Mixed Court, this court and the Special District Court were entirely under the influence of foreigners. Later, after the recovery and reorganization as the Provisional Court, a large part of the power was taken over by our country. When the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Special District Court, some rights were recovered by our side. Therefore, this time, the agreement will naturally be revised to recover various due rights according to law, and there will be no reversal, making the Special District Court more deformed.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Arrest of Customs Officers at Binjiang</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Search Mr. Pue, the Foreign Customs Commissioner's Private Residence</p>
<p>Remained Unyielding, Fortunately Released After Negotiations</p>
<p>The Customs seizure at Binjiang has already been officially announced by Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, with a brief account of the events. According to recent official reports, before the Binjiang Customs was seized by the Japanese and the puppet state with military force, Chinese and foreign customs officers at the site had once met to discuss resistance measures. After unanimous passage, they vowed to resist to the death and all the customs officers signed to show their determination. Then, at 11:00 PM on June 20th, the Japanese invading Manchurian troops suddenly dispatched armed soldiers, along with puppet state police and Japanese and White Russian detectives, to surround the Nangang General Customs, the Bazhanjiang Customs, and the residences of Chinese and foreign customs personnel. The situation was serious, as if facing a formidable enemy. The Japanese troops also made it clear that they were subordinate to the Military Commission and forced the customs officers to sign voluntary service forms for the puppet state's customs service. At the time, a small number of customs officers were weak-willed and were forced to submit, but most of the other customs officers took the opportunity to escape with the British Customs Commissioner Pue, Deputy Customs Commissioner Amberkro, Secretary General Sang, Inspector and Port Authority chiefs, carrying cash checks and important documents. They also tried their best to provide assistance. The other customs officers were sent by Customs Commissioner Pue to the British, American, and Italian consulates for temporary shelter. Unexpectedly, on July 7th, the head of the puppet state's Visitation Bureau, in cooperation with the chief of the Third Precinct of the Puppet Police, led puppet police chiefs and detectives to surround Customs Commissioner Pue's residence, claiming to search for communists and breaking into the residence, arbitrarily searching for about five hours. At that time, the British Vice-Consul in Harbin and a reporter from The Times of London, both witnessed these illegal acts, but nothing was found as a result. Only registration books and account books were taken before leaving. They then demanded the arrest of four Chinese customs officers. Customs Commissioner Pue and the British Vice-Consul protested, and the puppet state allowed to take the four officers for questioning and promised to release them immediately. The four Chinese officers were temporarily detained in the China Bank office, and then transported by the puppet police by car to the puppet state's Visitation Bureau, where they were imprisoned in a small, filthy, and unbearable prison. The next day, their families went to the prison to visit, but were not allowed. Fortunately, they managed to bribe the guards and were allowed a glimpse through the iron windows. It wasn't until the 19th that a Japanese national, the head of the puppet state's Visitation Bureau, interrogated them in the office. By this time, Pue, the Customs Commissioner, and the British Consul had been negotiating, and the puppet state had no choice but to release them. After a round of questioning, they were released only after obtaining the permission of the new Customs Chief Yu Shaowu. It wasn't until the 20th that the four customs officers were released. When the four customs officers were interrogated, the puppet state's Visitation Bureau offered them heavy bribes, ordering them to work in the puppet state's customs service, and promising that the positions and salaries would be better than before. The customs officers firmly refused to submit. They were then forced to disclose the whereabouts of important customs documents, but nothing was gained, and they were released.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Groups Demand Prohibition of Japanese Soldiers' Unauthorized Actions</h3>
<p>Letter to Consular Body to Stop Japanese Military Atrocities</p>
<p>Submission to the Municipal Government to Negotiate Compensation for Damages</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Council to Assume Responsibility for Security</p>
<p>The joint office of the Citizens' Federation Hongkou District Branches, and the Jiashang Road, Haining Road, Yangshupu Road, Hanbury Road, North Xizang Road, Suzhou Road, Broadway Road, East and West Huade Road, Yinxiang Road, Edinburgh Road, North Jiangxi Road, Chuanbao Road, and other business associations, more than twenty groups, based on the joint request of the Washington Road shop owners for negotiations, concerning the atrocities committed by the Japanese army there on August 10th at 11:00 PM, and the compensation for damages to which they are entitled, to ensure that such things do not happen again in the future and to maintain the peace of the concession, resolved at a joint representative meeting: (A) to write to US Consul General Cunningham, the leader of the consular body, to stop the illegal actions of the Japanese army; (B) to submit to the municipal government, to negotiate compensation for losses with the Japanese side; (C) to write to the Municipal Council, to assume responsibility for guaranteeing security within the concession in the future. The documents issued by the office are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Consular Body: Japan's fierceness is known to the world, and its ambition is rampant. It implements a gunboat diplomacy and policies of bombings with poisonous gas, seizing our country's land and trampling on the lives and property of our citizens. The fairness of the world's nations shows universal indignation, and the proposal of humanitarianism. Shanghai is a major international commercial port, connected to the commerce of all nations, and the honorable leaders of the consular body have always advocated good diplomatic relations. The organization of the Joint Committee to withdraw the Japanese army is especially admired by our Chinese citizens, in order to jointly seek the safety of the port of Shanghai. However, the Japanese are cunning and deceitful. Since the abolition of the Joint Committee, the Japanese army has been flexing its muscles and acting with arrogance, and on August 10th at 11:00 PM, more than fifty Japanese soldiers, in the Hongkou area of the Public Concession at the intersection of Washington Road and Yangzhou Road, destroyed the bamboo fence of the factory opened by Chen Meixing, and illegally and violently beat workers Deng Wenhui and Zhao Acai, causing unrest among the residents of the street. This matter concerns the unreasonable and tyrannical actions of the Japanese army, and the security of the concession is at stake. If it is not strictly investigated and prohibited, and if the Japanese army is not held responsible to ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future, we implore you to order the consuls of all countries to stop the illegal atrocities of the Japanese army. How can we allow the Japanese army to land at any time in the peaceful place of Shanghai, and make a fair statement, so that rumors will cease, so that we can live and work in peace? It is not only for us Chinese, but also for everyone. We are especially eager to reach you and hope you will investigate and grant our sympathy, and we hope to receive a reply. Sincerely, we address US Consul General Cunningham, leader of the consular body in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Submission to the Municipal Government: Regarding the atrocities of the Japanese army, quickly negotiate to protect the lives of the people and uphold humanity. It is now reported by the shops at the intersection of Washington Road and Yangzhou Road that at 11:00 PM on August 10th, fifty Japanese soldiers, arriving in several trucks and motorcycles, smashed the bamboo fence of the factory opened by Chen Wanxing, violently beat people, and stabbed Zhao Acai in the chin with a bayonet, and shot him in the chest, as well as injuring more than ten workers including Deng Wenhui. They also forced all the workers out of the factory, and monitored them, not allowing them to speak out, standing dumbfounded in the middle of the road. Such illegal actions should be negotiated. Based on this, it is confirmed that it is true that the Japanese army is acting unreasonably and barbarically, causing injury to life and damage to property. We implore the government to make a serious negotiation with the Japanese side: (1) severely punish the illegal Japanese army; (2) compensate for the losses; (3) guarantee that such inhumane acts will not happen again in the future; (4) reasonably prevent armed actions beyond the borders. The matter concerns the maintenance of local public safety, so as to warn against the</p>

<p>future, to achieve the goal, to calm public anger, is it appropriate to submit a document to the mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Wu, and hope that the negotiation will be swift, to the extreme expectation.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Council: In response to the joint report from the shops on Washington Road, that on August 10th at 11:00 PM, fifty Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived at the factory established by Chen Wanxing at the intersection of Yangzhou Road, smashing bamboo fences, destroying objects, and violently beating people, and injuring Deng Wenhui and fifteen others, stabbing Zhao Acai in the chin with a bayonet, and hitting his chest with a gun, etc., and expelling workers from the factory, standing dumbfounded in the middle of the road, monitoring their actions. Such unreasonable disturbance of the people's homes and endangering of security, please negotiate compensation. After the joint representative meeting, negotiations were made with the Municipal Council, and it was found that the road is one of the roads in the Public Concession, and the citizens have the obligation to pay taxes, while the Municipal Council should bear the responsibility of protection. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army committed atrocities and injured our Chinese citizens, and the inhuman actions were disregarded by the police at the time, allowing them to disturb the peace of the boundary, causing residents to be in a state of great panic. The bureau has abandoned its responsibility to maintain public safety, and there is nothing more serious than this. If proper precautions are not taken quickly in the future, how can the locality be maintained and public safety be guaranteed? The bureau should be held responsible for the unfortunate accident that occurred within the boundary and compensate for it in order to pacify the people and make justice shine, and ensure public safety in the future, and not allow the Japanese army to move freely, in order to emphasize the covenant.</p>
<p>For the sake of public convenience, this is addressed to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Telegraph of the Northeast National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Liaison Office Propaganda Committee of the Northeast National Salvation Army received three telegrams from Shanhaiguan on the 20th yesterday, recorded as follows: (1) Telegram at 10:00 AM: Because the National Salvation Army units of Liu Xiangge, Xu Guoliang, etc., are recently active in the vicinity of Anshan, Lishan, Qianshan, and Liaoyang, the Japanese army urgently mobilized the traitorous army of Wang Dianzhong from Yingkou to Lishan for alert. Late at night, there was fighting in the suburbs of Yingkou, and Japanese warships retaliated with artillery fire. At dawn, Japanese aircraft demonstrated, and people panicked. (2) Telegram at 1:00 PM: Shiqiao is located at the intersection of the South Manchuria Railway main line and the Yingkou branch line, and its location is strategically important. For more than ten days, the railway and telegraph lines have been repeatedly destroyed by the First Route Fourth Detachment of the National Salvation Army, led by Yu Zhendong. The enemy is struggling to cope. Luo, an engineer from the pseudo-Fengshan Railway, is ordered by the enemy to supervise and expedite repairs whenever traffic is cut off by the righteous army. Zhang Zi'an's unit, the Second Detachment of the First Route of the National Salvation Army, kidnapped him during a night attack on Juliuhe Station, as a warning to those who act as accomplices to the enemy. (3) Telegram at 3:00 PM: Since last night, the situation in Kangping County has been tense, and conflicts are expected within days. Tongliao is still in enemy hands.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to Xiong Shihui, Pleading to Abolish the Magnetite Tax</h3>
<p>Hu Yongzhi's Meritorious Service in Suppressing Bandits and Pacifying the Southeast</p>
<p>Cannot Cover the Fault of Suppressing Industry and Commerce and Harming the Economy</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce pointed out that although the Jiangxi Province established the special industry product and sales tax for bandit suppression and post-disaster relief, its representative Wang Yansong, together with the magnetite merchants' representatives, went to Beijing to petition for its abolition. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance repeatedly ordered its abolition, but these orders have not been followed. Yesterday, Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Standing Committee Members Wang Yansong, Bei Songsun, Yu Zuoting, and Lu Wenlong jointly sent a letter to Xiong Shihui, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, vehemently stating the reasons for its abolition. The letter reads, "Chairman Tianyi, greetings. Since this envoy moved to Fuzhang Gate, it has been long since we had the pleasure of your instruction, and we feel deeply ashamed. Regarding the matter of Jiangxi Province establishing a special product and sales tax for bandit suppression and post-disaster relief, entrusted by the magnetite merchants here, in addition to telegraphing the government to petition for its abolition, we also sent a private letter to you, expressing our views roughly. However, as time passed without a response, we assumed that our arguments failed to fully grasp your intentions for Jiangxi's prosperity and were therefore set aside. Later, we read in the newspapers your reply telegram to the Jiangxi Public Association, a lengthy and eloquent document analyzing the pros and cons, with the salvation of Jiangxi as its ultimate goal. Your adherence to righteousness is firm, and your belief in the principles is sincere, truly embodying the demeanor of ancient sages, and deserving of our utmost admiration. However, ancient philosophers said, 'Neither favor nor oppose, but compare with righteousness,' and 'Actions need not be resolute, but only where righteousness lies.' Thus, it is known that suppressing public opinion to assert one's own views, issuing a policy and adhering to it inflexibly, even if the intention is as pure as the heavens and can move the gods, can only be called 'public' but not 'fair.' This is why Wang Anshi was wise but ultimately regretted by later generations. If you do not mind hearing unpleasant truths, please allow us to fully express our ignorant opinions. When Hu Yongzhi implemented the Likin tax, even if Hubei Province was free from military conflicts, its annual revenue was only over one million taels. However, initially, there was the expedition to Xunyang, followed by the campaign to Anhui, directly seizing the key to transforming the overall situation in the Southeast with one province's grasp. Zeng Guofan said that Hubei, a barren region, supported an army of 60,000 with monthly expenses of 400,000 taels. Imagine, if Likin were not used as a substitute, where would the funds come from? The situation in Jiangxi Province is different, where the suppression of bandits relies on the central government and post-disaster relief is handled locally. The circumstances are vastly different. However, Hu initiated this practice, and corrupt officials have since used it as a convenient way to raise funds. After the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion, it was protected in every possible way, and despite repeated orders for its abolition, no one was willing to comply, ultimately poisoning the situation for seventy years. Industry and commerce have gradually declined, leading to the phenomenon of foreign goods flooding China, providing an opportunity for economic aggression, and Hu Yongzhi is not free from blame. Generally, matters involving raising funds are like the saying in the 'Book of Rites,' 'Once it is initiated, no one dares to abolish it.' Once a policy is implemented, abolishing it is as difficult as ascending to heaven. The beginning is easy, but the end is difficult, as ancient people have already said. Therefore, although Hu Yongzhi's implementation of the Likin tax had the merit of pacifying the South, it cannot cover the fault of suppressing industry and commerce and harming the national economy. Only after the National Government explicitly ordered the abolition of Likin could the seventy years of corrupt policies be completely eliminated. Although it can be said to be bringing the dead back to life, the people's livelihood has suffered such a long period of deprivation that only a small part has been restored. Therefore, the decree to abolish Likin is like defending a newly built dam on a river that has long been breached. It is appropriate for officials and the people to work together to guard this dam. If it is still considered insignificant and a small-scale test is attempted in a remote area, it is like a thousand-tael dam collapsing due to an ant hole. In such a situation, the only option is to gather the masses again to perish in the flood. Today, the joint efforts of the people of Jiangxi and those from outside Jiangxi to oppose this move are like a river dam that has been breached for seventy years and has just been closed. It is absolutely unacceptable to allow it to be breached again. This is not to find fault with you, but the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui have already implemented and stopped various forms of Likin tax, which you are aware of. The province of Hubei is surrounded by bandits on all sides, and only the three towns of Wuhan remain intact. The disaster is no less severe than righteous uprisings. If Jiangxi insists on its original plan, and Hubei follows suit, how can we respond? This is what merchants privately worry about and dare not fail to report to you. You said that once the product and sales tax is paid, it can be circulated throughout the country, which is different from the Likin tax of the past. In fact, when the Likin tax was first implemented, the regulations were also lenient and not every pass was set up with checkpoints. Later, the profit was analyzed to the smallest detail, the legislation gradually became stricter, and the tax rate also increased. The Likin tax from the late Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China had instances where the tax rate reached five or ten percent, gradually deviating from the original intention of the Likin tax. This could not have been anticipated at the beginning. Moreover, the merchant adds the Likin to the price, and ultimately it is passed on to the consumer. If it is sold in the province, the surviving people who have already suffered banditry cannot bear to be exploited again. If it is sold in other provinces, people will consider Jiangxi products relatively expensive, and merchants will find it more difficult to profit from operating Jiangxi products, and will inevitably seek alternatives. Therefore, Jiangxi Province's attempt to restore the Likin tax will inevitably lead to slow sales and abandonment of natural advantages, further increasing unemployment and fueling banditry. What the Jiangxi Public Association insists on disputing should be examined impartially, and it seems to have value for consideration. Furthermore, regarding the magnetite industry, Jingdezhen, which produces magnetite, is close to bandit areas. Since the provincial bureau sent personnel to establish a bureau and start operations, it was destroyed by unemployed workers who gathered to destroy the bureau. Recently, kiln factories and merchants have all suspended operations because the case has not been resolved for a long time. The provincial bureau suddenly sent personnel again at this time, and even led a company of soldiers to go there, relying on armed forces to assert their authority. Even if bandits do not take advantage of this, it is feared that it will trigger a major change. The three bandit disturbances in Changzhen have left the area with long-term damage. If another major disaster is brewed, the vitality will be completely destroyed. Jiangxi's magnetite products, suffering from this setback, cannot be transported and sold to various places, and the newly emerging magnetite industry in the Northeast has also been completely destroyed since the Shenyang Incident. What is sold after this is only hatred of goods. Can anyone with blood and spirit not sigh with regret? You said that the bandit suppression and post-disaster relief donation was agreed upon by all, but according to what the Jiangxi merchants reported, it is not entirely true. When the case was discussed, among the one hundred and several dozen people, only forty-one agreed. Subsequently, the reverse evidence was used for the vote, and it was hurriedly passed. The representative of Guangfeng County, Xu Jinghuan, and others believed that it was inappropriate and described the situation of the meeting in the newspaper, almost incurring the official's displeasure. The so-called unanimous consultation is feared to be the officials catering to the will of the superiors, and you have not noticed it. This case has been instructed by the central authorities and discussed by senior compatriots, but you insist on not changing your mind. However, Xiaolai and others still dare to offend you because the merchants are in distress, and it is impossible to refuse the obligation, and you are sincerely serving the country, and it is impossible to refuse the righteousness. Perhaps you can appreciate their sincerity and make a change in an imperceptible way. We hope you will forgive our recklessness and ignorance. Respectfully submitted, and wishing you success in your work."</p>

<h3>Handling of the Anhui Northern Relief Work Corruption Case, Representatives of the Anhui Fellow-Townsmen Association Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Regarding the Anhui Northern Relief Work corruption case, the National Government Relief Committee previously sent personnel Sun Yunzeng and Wang Chusheng, along with representatives of the Beijing-Shanghai Anhui Fellow-Townsmen Association, Shi Yinsheng, Wang Zhaoquan, Yue Xiangru, and Lv Yinan, to Bengbu for investigation. They spent more than twenty days in Bengbu, collecting ample evidence. They recently returned to Shanghai and have drafted a 64-page report on the investigation, with 102 pieces of important evidence attached, and 9 agreed-upon solutions formulated before departure. Based on the facts and in accordance with the criminal law and the regulations for punishing relief personnel, they have formulated 9 opinions on punishment and submitted them to the National Government Relief Committee, requesting that they be dealt with according to the original agreement and according to law. There are four items regarding Yang Shucheng's abuse of power for personal gain, three items regarding Chen Shifu's delay in relief work, and nine items regarding Quan Shaowu's concealment and delay. There are also six items regarding the Bengbu Grain Station's deduction of wheat exchange accounts and two items regarding those responsible for price changes, all of which are said to be accompanied by irrefutable evidence. It is requested that the Relief Committee separately transfer the cases to the court, increasing the punishment by one-third, or deal with them on its own according to the severity of the circumstances. As for how much wheat was under-issued and how much wheat remained from the work relief, it is also requested that the numbers be published and re-issued. The report was submitted on the 20th of this month. Furthermore, Tan Shaohua, representative of the Anhui Northern Flood Relief Association, also came to Shanghai recently to participate in and assist in the process.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Responsible Transportation of Freight Cars on National Railways</h3>
<p>Implemented from September 1st</p>
<p>Yu Chengzhi, Director of the Operations Department of the Ministry of Railways, has spared no effort in reorganizing the operations of various railways since taking office. Director Yu believes that responsible transportation of freight cars is crucial to the development of railway operations. The progress of railway operations in various countries relies heavily on freight transport, followed by passenger transport. Therefore, he immediately formulated the "General Regulations on Responsible Transportation of Freight Cars on the Railways of the Republic of China," which has been promulgated by the Ministry of Railways and is scheduled to take effect on September 1st. Zheng Baozhao, Director of Transportation of the Lianglu Railways, has always advocated the commercialization of railways and has also studied responsible transportation extensively.

The details of the regulations on responsible transportation of freight cars are presented below:</p>

The railway waives the loading fee, unloading fee, or loading and unloading fee, but during loading and unloading, the railway may, depending on the circumstances, assign responsible personnel to supervise on-site at any time. Article 21: Verification and sealing of cars loaded on dedicated sidings. After the consignor has loaded a full car of goods on the dedicated siding, before the vehicles are transferred to the station for shipment, the stationmaster or freight clerk shall, together with the consignor, check each item listed in the consignment note one by one to ensure that they match.

Goods transported responsibly shall not be escorted by the consignor in the car, but if necessary, if the consignor requests to take care of them in the car and is approved by the railway, they shall purchase third-class passenger tickets in accordance with the regulations, with a maximum of two people per car. Article 24: Matters to be observed by the caretaker. The caretaker shall carry the responsible freight receipt or delivery order with them for inspection. They shall not obstruct railway operations and shall not smoke or carry dangerous goods such as lamps and candles. Article 25: Consignor changes.

<h3>Unreasonable Doting of an Old Mother</h3>
<p>A Prodigal Son Should Feel Ashamed</p>
<p>The Law Does Not Forgive, Sentence Remains Imprisonment</p>
<p>Cui Jiaping, a man from Jiangbei, aged 23, residing at No. 73, Qingyuli, Yangshupu Road, heard his wife crying on the 15th of this month at about 2 p.m. His wife complained that his mother, Cui Sunshi, asked her to attend to her father-in-law's illness, leading to verbal arguments, etc. Cui, in a moment of protecting his wife, beat his mother's chest and abdomen, causing minor injuries. Someone reported this to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched a detective to arrest Cui Jiaping and bring him to the station. Sunshi was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The next morning, he was transferred to the First Special District Court, where the police station charged him with the crime of injuring a senior family member. After obtaining Ms. Cui's consent during the inquiry, it was ordered that the defendant be detained pending Ms. Cui's recovery. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin continued the trial in the Fourth Criminal Court. Cui Sunshi, having recovered from her injuries, appeared in court and stated that she was confused and disoriented at the time and mistakenly accused her son Jiaping of beating her. In reality, only her waist was bruised from bumping into something, and her chest and abdomen were completely uninjured, asking the court to release him. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, argued that Ms. Cui was deliberately trying to absolve the defendant, but the police station's prosecution could not be withdrawn. He maintained that for the sake of social order and morality, the defendant should be punished according to the law, or given a chance to reform and be granted a suspended sentence. When questioned, the defendant firmly insisted that he did not beat his mother. Judge Fu declared to Cui Sunshi that she should not be overly doting. He asked about what kind of son he was.  Ms. Cui firmly requested his release. After giving the defendant a thorough admonishment, Judge Fu sentenced Cui Jiaping to one year of imprisonment, with the number of days in custody to be credited at two days for one day of imprisonment, suspended for four years.</p>

<h3>The Whole Zhejiang Public Association’s Anti-Smoking Stance</h3>
<p>The Whole Zhejiang Public Association sent separate letters to Commander Jiang and Director Lü regarding its anti-smoking stance. The text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To Commander Jiang Dingwen, Mr. Mingshanxiang: Upon reading the Shanghai Evening News of August 11, regarding the news that the people of northern Anhui resisting the tobacco levy had led to a major upheaval, which is truly heartbreaking for the people. Tracing back to the northern invasion of the Japanese bandits in Liaoning and Shenyang, and the destruction by the Red Army in the south of Fujian and Jiangxi, the water, drought, and epidemics in various places are also approaching in succession. Our people are dying from enemies, bandits, disasters, and epidemics in countless numbers. Northern Anhui borders Jiangsu and is close to the capital. However, it is said that people die from officials as a result of resisting the tobacco levy. Alas, our common people have so many and such broad ways to die. Our association is alarmed by the rampant spread of the scourge of smoking and saddened by the abandonment of moral principles. We were heartbroken and deeply worried about the impending catastrophe when we heard that the special tax office in Anhui Province was established in defiance of orders. Now, it is reported that the county committee of Suxian County, carrying soldiers, forcibly demanded tobacco levies, shot and killed villagers, resulting in a huge tragedy. Recently, the incident has escalated and spread to Lingtong and other counties. The government even labeled them as violent mobs and communist bandits, and a large-scale suppression is imminent. The entire northern Anhui region will be plunged into an area of terror for a long time. At this moment, your command is transferring defenses to Bengbu, Anhui, and is responsible for guarding the local area. It is requested that you clearly inform the provincial authorities to quickly and permanently exempt this tobacco tax, allow the people to start anew, investigate and punish the names of the officials who incited the upheaval to alleviate the people's grievances. It is also requested that you quickly select and dispatch officers to the site of the incident, convene local elders, explain the great righteousness, and order them to disband and return to their fields within a limited time, and not to cause further disturbances to peacefully conclude the case. If it is absolutely necessary, only punish one or two ringleaders and not indiscriminately punish those who were coerced, so as to avoid implicating the innocent and it is not appropriate to resort to arms lightly, lest it causes the destruction of both the good and the bad. Our association, holding to local friendship, pleads for the people of that area. Respectfully asking for your kindness and consideration. An attached clipping is also respectfully submitted for your review. Respectfully, wishing you peace and prosperity. The Whole Zhejiang Public Association respectfully submitted on August 20.</p>
<p>To Director Lü Bichou, Mr. Bichou: It has been eight months since you came to Zhejiang. Our association, fearing being accused of overstepping its bounds, has never dared to express a small opinion to disturb your ears. Now, upon reading the newspaper, it is reported that Zhejiang Province will convene a provincial anti-smoking conference today. It is truly commendable that you are able to rectify internal affairs and focus on anti-smoking efforts amidst the turmoil of political trends, which is fortunate for the people of Zhejiang. Our association is alarmed by the rampant spread of the scourge of smoking and saddened by the abandonment of prohibitions, feeling as if we have a bone stuck in our throats, and we have long wanted to express ourselves. Fortunately, we have encountered a virtuous official who removes harm for the people, and we feel sympathetic and joyful. In addition, we have an expectation. We earnestly offer our shallow knowledge, which may not be helpful, and hope that the great gentleman will adopt it. Tracing back, Zhejiang has always been the province with the best smoking ban. From the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic of China, there was a trend of complete eradication. The main approach was that the government and the people worked together bravely. Each county established anti-smoking branches [later renamed anti-smoking bureaus], and local gentry were selected to manage the affairs. In addition, smoking cessation bureaus and rehabilitation centers were established to provide assistance, with local officials and people's organizations providing guidance and supervision. As a result, bribery, connivance, planting, and fraud were unheard of, and offenders were able to be transformed and reformed. The effect was rapid, and planting and selling were completely eradicated. Since the abolition of the anti-smoking bureaus and the assignment of their powers to the police, without allowing the people to intervene, the scourge of smoking has re-emerged. Police officials are from other places and are not familiar with the local situation. The virtuous ones have the worry of not being able to see and hear everything, and the unscrupulous ones take advantage of the smoking ban for profit. The strict smoking ban is beyond question. Today, if you want to rectify the smoking ban, even if you cannot restore the old system, you must allow the people to participate in the management. You should order each county to organize county, district, township, and town anti-smoking investigation committees, responsible for investigating planting, selling, and smoking incidents, subject to the supervision of the highest local administrative officials. The police are only responsible for assisting in the investigation, and they are allowed to be commanded by the investigators. Except for current offenders, they have no direct power of arrest. Penalties are completely submitted to the local judicial organs for processing. Investigation expenses are drawn from the anti-smoking fines to cover rewards. If government officials are suspected of having smoking habits, the people are allowed to report them. The province and county should establish all levels of investigation centers and formulate special regulations to handle them. In this way, it will not violate the political system, and the people will be spared from disturbances. The anti-smoking policy will surely be implemented. As for the severity of the smoking scourge and the different situations in each province in Zhejiang, the provinces of western Zhejiang, such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, are adjacent to Shanghai, and transportation by ferries is convenient, so smoking is particularly prevalent. However, if you pay attention to searching at stations and wharves, you can gradually reduce it. Shanghai, Jinhua, Quzhou, Yanzhou and other places all smoke red pills. The Shanghai Evening News reported on the 2nd of this month that there were six red pill manufacturing institutions in Lanxi City, and there were a total of more than 70 large and small sales institutions. The daily sales of red pills in urban and rural areas amounted to 150,000 pills, which is a shocking number. The districts of Wenzhou and Taizhou have always been areas for producing opium pulp. At that time, banning planting required significant sacrifices. Recently, the prohibition has been relaxed, and the old trick of private planting has been used again. Deep mountains and valleys are again planted with poppy seeds. Autumn is approaching, and it is time to plant seeds again. Special attention should be paid to strictness. Fortunately, Zhejiang's politics have always been known for being honest, and there has been no special tax or forced planting. Prohibition is still easy. If officials and people can cooperate and conduct serious investigations, without being perfunctory or abusive, and rewarding and punishing fairly, holding on to strictness, the scourge of smoking in Zhejiang will surely be completely eradicated. As for Zhejiang Province’s anti-smoking achievements, the two files of the first year of the Republic of China are still there. Should they be followed or still need to be revised is up to your wisdom to examine and take. There is no need for our association to elaborate in detail. One day, when you save the world from the darkness and pull the fallen out of the sea of suffering, your merits will be as great as Yao's and will stand alongside Yu's governance of floods and fierce beasts. Our association respectfully awaits and watches. An attached copy of the Evening News is also included for your review. Respectfully submitted, wishing you political auspiciousness. The Whole Zhejiang Public Association respectfully submitted on August 15.</p>

<h3>Liu Hongsheng and Others are Appointed as Reorganization Committee Members of the Coal Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Municipal Coal Industry Association had previously convened two general membership meetings, but both failed to form due to insufficient legal attendance. Therefore, it submitted a request to the competent authority to allow for reorganization. Liu Hongsheng, Xie Hengchuang, and fifteen others were publicly appointed as reorganization committee members. According to the person in charge of the association, it is rare that Mr. Liu Hongsheng has readily agreed to take on this arduous task. It is also heard that Mr. Liu already has an entire plan to promote domestic goods and the determination to maintain the development of the industry.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Industry Association Re-election Yesterday</h3>
<p>Increased the Number of Supervisory Committee Members to Seven</p>

He Yuanqing from the Municipal Party Department, Song Zhongqing from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Lu Wenshao from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended the meeting to supervise the election. Lu Zhengbing presided over the meeting, and formalities were followed. First, the chairman reported on the association's work progress. Regarding the promotion of domestic silk, the association participated in the fashion exhibition organized by the Social Affairs Bureau and the exhibition of domestic silk and satin. Regarding the business tax, because Zhejiang Province drafted tax rules with a heavy levy of 30/1000, special representatives were sent to Beijing and Zhejiang to petition, eventually reaching the goal of not exceeding 2/1000. Regarding patriotic obligations and disaster relief, approximately 20,000 yuan was donated for the 19th Route Army's military expenses, and approximately 10,000 yuan was donated to disaster relief for floods and bandits in various provinces. Next, representatives from the upper levels gave instructions. Then, the proposals were discussed. (1) It was proposed to authorize the executive committee to urge members to earnestly implement the association's rules. The resolution passed. (2) It was proposed to earnestly promote domestic goods and strictly prohibit members from privately importing inferior goods. The resolution passed, and the executive committee was authorized to expel members with evidence and publish the expulsion in newspapers for public censure. (3) It was proposed to request the central government to issue a nationwide order to party and government agencies and civil servants to earnestly wear domestic silk fabrics as an example to the people.

Their words were passionate and moving, and the applause was thunderous. The proposal to increase the number of supervisory committee members to seven was also passed.

<h3>Former Employee Plots to Harm Former Employer</h3>
<p>Extortion Fails, Thrown Into the River</p>
<p>At around 10 a.m. yesterday, someone suddenly shouted for help near the river by Song Jiaoren's tomb in Zhabei. Passersby and farmers in the area heard the shout and went to investigate. They saw two people wrestling in the river and immediately rescued them. After inquiring, it was revealed that the former employee, Zhong Dingfa, and others had been extorting their former employer, Xiang Yixin, without success and intended to harm him. Someone ran to report this to the Tanjiaqiao Police Station, and Officer Chen Xuemin immediately led police officers to the scene and brought everyone to the station, where they were transferred to the Fourth District. District Officer Zhu Ligong interrogated Xiang Yixin, who stated that he was 47 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 39, Xiangyi Lane, Gonghe Xin Road. He owns a glass factory and a Xingchang foundry on Oujia Road in Hongkou. He enjoys chanting Buddhist scriptures, so he bought more than ten acres of land at the end of Gonghe Xin Road in Xiangyi Lane and built a temple for self-cultivation. He goes to this temple every day to chant Buddhist scriptures. This morning around 9 a.m., he was sitting in his own car from the foundry on Oujia Road to the temple to chant Buddhist scriptures. Unexpectedly, when passing by Song Park Road, he encountered three former employees who had quit from the foundry, who blocked the way and extorted 100 yuan. Xiang refused at the time and drove to the temple. At 9:30 a.m., he took a car from the temple back to the factory. He did not know that Zhong and the others were still waiting at the original location. They were stopped again, and Zhong dragged him off the car, claiming that if he did not lend them 100 yuan, they would push him into the river and drown him. Then, he was forcibly pushed into the river by the three of them, causing his whole body to be soaked. Fortunately, he was rescued, and did not suffer the disaster of drowning. Later, the head of the Tanjiaqiao Police Station and police officers arrived, but the other two accomplices had already fled. Zhong Dingfa confessed that he was 41 years old, lived at No. 99, Keming Road, Yokohama Bridge, and was a foundry worker. This morning, at around 7 a.m., he and his companions, Jiang Pingfang and Yu Shoushen, discussed borrowing money from Xiang Laoyan near a tea shop on Qiujiang Road, and then waited by Song Jiaoren's tomb. The first time they encountered Xiang was around 9 a.m. Xiang refused to lend them money and left. Later, they saw him driving out of the temple, and Jiang and Yu pulled the car and asked him to borrow 100 yuan for them to go to Sichuan to do business. Xiang jumped out of the car, grabbed him, twisted him to the river, and fell into the river together. His driver shouted for help, and Jiang and Yu fled. He wrestled with Xiang in the river and was rescued and pulled ashore. There were also female relations, Lu Ajin (46 years old, from Shanghai, living in Xujiazhai, Gonghe Xin Road), and Gu Aimei (55 years old, living in Jiangyuan Lane, Xinzha), who claimed that they were both Buddhist friends with Xiang Yixin and came to express their condolences, and did not know anything else. After verifying the confessions, the district officer, based on the case of accusation of extortion without success and intention to harm, except for Lu Ajin and Gu Aimei who were found to be irrelevant and released, ordered them to be sent to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Beating and Injury of Director of the Typecasting Department of the Chung Hwa Book Company</h3>
<p>The Perpetrators Are Still Shifting Responsibility to Each Other</p>
<p>Ni Yougeng Describes the Incident</p>
<p>At the end of June of this year, the head office of the Chung Hwa Book Company on Jing'an Temple Road dismissed several workers from each department who were not performing well. However, those who were dismissed believed that this was done by Ni Yougeng, the head of the typecasting department of the factory.  They harbored resentment towards Ni. They secretly gathered and discussed, and funded vagrants to wait at the entrance of Minhhou Lane, Hardoon Road in the west of Shanghai at 8 a.m. on July 18. When they saw Ni arriving, they rushed forward and attacked him with fists and weapons, causing Ni to be seriously injured and fall to the ground. Fortunately, a Westerner caught a glimpse of the incident, intervened, and the perpetrators fled. Later, the police arrested Liu Wenqing, Han Liuxiu, Li Qili, Tao Shunbao, Xu Yunzhou, Gao Haosheng, Gu Guisheng and other seven suspects in this case.  They were sent to the First Special District Court and detained, awaiting further interrogation after Ni recovered. This has already been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that Ni's injuries have passed the dangerous period and are gradually recovering. Therefore, the Special Court held a hearing yesterday morning. Ni also appeared in court with his lawyer, Pan Zhensheng, and filed a private prosecution, requesting compensation for damages. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, presented the case.  Ni Yougeng stated that on November 16 of last year, he took office as director of the typecasting department of the Chung Hwa Book Company. On June 31 of this year, the factory director dismissed workers such as Tao Shunbao, Xu Yunzhou, and Gu Guisheng, who were not performing well. On July 18 at 8 a.m., I was going from home to the factory. While passing by the entrance of Minhhou Lane on Hardoon Road, four people suddenly rushed out of the lane. One person choked my throat, and two others each held knives and sticks. The knife-wielding person stabbed my leg twice, causing me to fall to the ground. As I was trying to get up, the person with the stick hit my back several times, causing me to pass out. I have been treated until now and have not fully recovered. My legs are swollen and painful, and I cannot walk properly. He pointed out that the defendant Liu Wenqing was the perpetrator who was present at the time and also said that Gao Haosheng also seemed to be present, and the rest were not seen. He requested a strict punishment. As for why the defendants committed such a heinous act and injured my body, it must be asked of Han Liuxiu, because Han was repeatedly promoted by me, but instead of being grateful, he committed such a cruel act. I really feel that people's hearts are sinister. When questioned, Liu Wenqing confessed that this incident was led by Wang Lao Si and Xiao Shandong, who were at large, who instructed me to go to fight. But when I arrived, Ni was already injured, so I did not actually do anything. Han Liuxiu denied being promoted by Ni and was evasive about the attack. Li Qili, Tao Shunbao, and Gu Guisheng confessed that they were not at the scene when the fight occurred, but Han had previously instructed them to contribute money to hire someone to fight, so Li and Gu each contributed five yuan, and Tao contributed eight yuan. Xu Yunzhou confessed that he did not know anything about this matter. Gao Haosheng did not admit to being present, saying that he was sick that day, so he went out to see a Tong Shen girl on Luban Road at 7 a.m. for treatment and returned home at 2 p.m., which can be investigated. Judge Wu ordered the defendants to be detained and interrogated again in seven days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai North Office of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Resumes Operations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai North Office of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association resumed operations yesterday after being robbed. A meeting was convened at its superior association on Ningbo Road. Mr. Weng Tiansheng was publicly elected as chairman. After the formalities were completed, Chairman Weng briefly stated: "Since the Japanese pirates wreaked havoc, the entire office has been reduced to ashes. Today, we are resuming operations after the pain. How can we let it go? In the future, we must never forget the enemy (the audience gnashed their teeth)." Tong Lingyun said that operating with enemy goods is no different from eating a bomb. My first expectation is to ensure that the industry does not import any enemy goods. Teng Zhixiang said that after the robbery, the industry deeply knows that it is not enough to restore the original office to seek welfare. The national tax and local tax, etc., especially need to be researched, and the superior association also believes that the office's responsibilities lie in this, and it is inconvenient to remain abandoned for a long time, and there is an expectation to promote restoration. Today, the office is implementing restoration. The industry is not afraid of the heat and participates in the summer heat, which is enough to show enthusiasm. This restoration of the office is no different from redoing someone's house. The affairs are more complicated, and it is natural. I hope everyone will be of one mind and achieve the effect of uniting the public and becoming a city. Subsequently, all matters of progress were discussed. Ye Peilin was invited to serve as a clerk, and Wang Rukang was invited to serve as a donator. The office is temporarily borrowed from No. 728, Wanxiangli, Aierjin Road.</p>
<h3>Bandits Take Advantage of the War to Kidnap Villagers</h3>
<p>Yang Zhiqing, a villager in the Gaojiazai area at the end of Yangshupu's Ningguo Road, suddenly disappeared in March of this year during the Shanghai war. Later, Zhang Qiutao, who lived in the same house, helped to look for him, and threatening letters of extortion came one after another at that time. Therefore, Yang's mother entrusted Zhang to find and contact him. It was said that 5,000 yuan was required at a low price in Caojiadu. The final negotiation was for 2,000 yuan, but it was still not resolved. It was already May. Yang's mother was anxious, so she filed a complaint with the Yangshupu Police Station, which arrested Zhang Qiutao. According to Zhang, he forged the letters to defraud Yang's mother. However, he also implicated Chen Ziwen, Song Xiaogou, Yang Dongnu and others as kidnappers. Therefore, the police station sent Zhang to the First Special District Court, which sentenced Zhang Qiutao to two months of imprisonment and a fine of 500 yuan. Yang Sannu, who was also involved, was acquitted. However, Chen Ziwen, Yang Dongnu, Zhu Xiaogou and others were still at large and had not been arrested. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Team was reported and arrested them successively a few days ago. They confessed that they took advantage of the chaos to kidnap and plot to extort money. They were immediately sent to the Judicial Section and transferred to the local court for trial.</p>
<h3>Girl Sues for Seduction and Injury</h3>
<p>Yang Fengmei, a young girl from Caohejing Town in the western countryside of this county, recently hired Lawyer Wu Lüpíng to file a private prosecution with the criminal court of the local court. The gist of her lawsuit is: "The plaintiff, Yang Fengmei, is 17 years old (born in the Year of the Dragon). Her parents died when she was young, so she was fostered at the home of her uncle, Hu Jingzhi (in Caohejing Town). Chen Xuewen opened a lace factory in the town last year and rented Hu Jingzhi's house. Chen used Fengmei's youth and easy deception, so he feigned diligence and seduced her in every possible way. Fengmei was seduced by him, so on November 26 of last year (at that time, there were many rumors in the countryside during the Shanghai war), she was driven by Chen to Shanghai and went to the Oriental Hotel together. Fengmei was deceived and lost her virginity there. Then, she rented a house in Qianjiatang, Xiafei Road, in the French Concession for about half a month. Chen left without returning, leaving Fengmei's life uncared for. Fengmei originally intended to commit suicide to end her life, but her accumulated hatred was not vented, and she was still unwilling. Therefore, she is suing Chen Xuewen for seduction and injury according to the law. If she is under sixteen years old, she will be charged with rape." Yesterday, Judge Deng held a hearing. The defendant Chen Xuewen did not appear. Only the plaintiff Yang Fengmei and Lawyer Wu appeared in court to recount the past. The judge ordered another subpoena.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Five Robbers in Connection with the Robbery on Rue de Kouen-Tchen</h3>
<p>Regarding the robbery at the residence of Madam Wu Ma, a Suzhou woman living at No. 56 Rue de Kouen-Tchen in the French Concession, which occurred at 5 a.m. on the 14th of this month, where robbers broke in and stole clothing and other valuables worth over 500 yuan: One robber, carrying the stolen goods, fled to the International Settlement. Two Chinese detectives on patrol from the British police force spotted and intercepted him. While being taken to the police station, the robber, in desperation, pulled out a pistol and shot himself in the waist. The bullet entered his abdomen. He was taken to the Municipal Council Hospital but died from his injuries. This incident has already been reported in various newspapers. Following this incident, the French police conducted a thorough investigation of the robbery gang. Yesterday, Inspector Jin Jiulin, Detective Zhang Ziying, and Li Yaolong of the special agency, discovered that the gang was hiding in Room 14 of the Baohe Inn at No. 201 Dehe Lane, Canton Road, in the International Settlement. At 10 a.m., they, together with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Laozha Police Station, rushed to the location and arrested the robbers Wang Zhiming, Fei Yongxing, and Yu Youqing. They also found two pistols and twenty bullets under the sofa chair. Furthermore, they arrested Qian Ju, a member of the gang, at No. 23 Zhongxing Inn on Sanma Road, and Jiang Yihai at No. 76 Chunjiang Third Inn on Rue de la Mission in the French Concession. A total of five robbers were arrested and taken back to the police station to await interrogation by the Second Special District Court this morning.</p>
<h3>Gu Guitang Commits Suicide Due to Wife's Elopement</h3>
<p>Gu Guitang, a 36-year-old Jiangsu native who performed Changzhou Tanhuang opera, committed suicide yesterday after his wife ran away, causing him extreme grief and resentment. Around 10 p.m., he secretly ingested opium paste. He was discovered, and the Gordon Road Police Station was immediately notified, dispatching Patrolman No. 78 to take Gu to Renji Hospital. Treatment proved ineffective, and he died at 1:30 a.m. the next morning.</p>
<h3>Punishment for Establishing an Illegal Roulette Gambling Den</h3>
<p>A foreigner, who had previously established a large, private roulette gambling den at No. 809 Route Gustav-Le Rouge in the French Concession, was discovered by the French police. Twenty-seven Chinese and foreign accomplices were arrested and brought to the Second Special District Court. After investigation, they were sentenced accordingly. The police subsequently apprehended Zhao Bingzhang, also known as Zhao Changzhang and Shao Bingfu, from Pinghu, who was an accomplice at the gambling den. He was brought to the Second Special District Court yesterday. Zhao confessed to being an accomplice at the gambling den. The presiding judge sentenced Zhao Bingzhang to one month of imprisonment and a fine of one hundred yuan for assisting in providing a gambling venue, as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Zheng Wei and Others Indicted for Malfeasance</h3>
<p>Zheng Wei, the chief of the Fourth Precinct of the Third District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau in Gaoqiao District, has been frequently involved in acts of malfeasance and oppression of the people since taking office, such as illegal punishments, bribery, and extortion. The local people have suffered greatly. Citizens Chen Chen, Xu Xinghou, and others from Gaoqiao reported the major malfeasance of Chief Zheng Wei in a formal complaint to the Shanghai District Court. Yang An, the prosecutor of the court, conducted a thorough investigation and confirmed that Zheng Wei was indeed involved in malfeasance and obstruction of freedom. A public prosecution was initiated in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law. Meng Zhaolong, a police officer in the same precinct, was dispatched to guard the area near Zhangjiazhai on the 23rd of last month. Late at night, he broke into the home of Zhang Linsheng with a firearm and committed robbery. The criminal was captured on the spot by the public and handed over to the precinct, which transferred him to the District Court. The prosecutor also investigated and confirmed the facts and initiated a public prosecution in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>[P Edison Warehouse Carelessly&gt;</p>
<p>At 11:05 p.m. last night, a warehouse of a certain number in the Edison Electric Bulb Factory at No. 140 Rue Robert in West Shanghai caught fire due to carelessness. Suddenly, flames erupted, accompanied by thick, dark smoke and blazing firelight. A large amount of raw materials and a large glass shed were destroyed. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire at 4:45 a.m. this morning.</p>
<h3>Complications Regarding Fire Insurance Claims at Yuanchang Pawnshop</h3>
<p>Yuanchang Pawnshop, located in Gongyi Lane on Kaifeng Road in the International Settlement, was destroyed by fire on February 4th of this year. Prior to the fire, the owner of the pawnshop, Cai Mingsheng from Chaozhou, had taken out fire insurance with the Ping An Company. The company was organized by pawnshop operators using a system of mutual guarantee, so the payment of compensation should have been straightforward and without any problems. However, the person in charge of the company's affairs used the excuse of war to delay the compensation. After Cai repeatedly urged them, a meeting was finally convened, and Zheng Ziliang, a public appraiser, was invited to investigate and arbitrate. According to the investigation, the fire was indeed an accidental fire and not related to war damage, and the fire insurance on the property had already been compensated, etc. However, after receiving the report, the company continued to delay and did not resolve the matter. Cai Mingsheng was dissatisfied and appealed to the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai to uphold justice and resolve the matter properly. The Chamber of Commerce then convened a meeting of its executive and supervisory committees a few days ago, chaired by Zheng Zhengqiu. Zhou Songsheng, Xiao Zizhen, Li Shaogeng, Cai Junqing, Weng Ziguang, Guo Jiuru, Zheng Ziliang, Fang Gongpu, Lin Huibo, and more than 30 others attended. They decided to appoint Li Shaogeng, Guo Jiuru, and Zheng Ziliang to conduct a reinvestigation and report. It is said that the results are completely consistent with the previous investigation. Now that there is this conclusive evidence, the company should not be able to make any further excuses.</p>

<h3>Husband and Wife Mutually Defame and Fight</h3>
<p>Wife and Mother-in-Law Both Injured</p>
<p>Neither Party Wants a Divorce</p>
<p>Li Aji, a 28-year-old native of Ningbo residing at No. 52 Rue Edward VII, had a quarrel with his wife, Yao, a 24-year-old also from Ningbo, around 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, resulting in injuries to her chest and abdomen. Yao's mother, Ni, intervened to mediate but was stabbed in the left arm and neck by Li, causing her to fall to the ground and cry for help. Chinese Constable No. 2023 arrived upon hearing the commotion and arrested Li, along with a kitchen knife, and took him to the Wayside Police Station for detention. The next morning, he was transferred to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the defendant claimed at the police station that the injury to his mother-in-law, Yao Ni, was not caused by him with a knife, but that she had injured herself with a broken piece of mirror glass. However, the investigation by the police revealed this to be untrue. Both victims, having been bandaged by doctors at Tongren Hospital, came to court to testify. The kitchen knife was presented as evidence. Yao stated that she had been in Shanghai for four years since coming from her hometown. Lately, because the defendant has a mistress, he often abuses her. She has been subjected to both physical violence and wants a divorce but I am unwilling. He then wrote a letter asking my mother to take me back, so last night another dispute arose and he beat me and kicked my abdomen with his feet. My mother stepped forward to mediate and was cut with a knife. Yao Ni said that the defendant is my son-in-law. This time he wrote to me asking me to come to Shanghai for only four days and was very rude to me. He wanted to divorce my daughter but I would not agree, so he beat us and cut me with a knife, and showed the court her wounds as evidence. The defendant stated that his wife, Yao, often goes out to play or returns late at night. He does not know what she is doing outside, and she has a lover. He has previously scolded her, and she has taken her clothes, jewelry, and 50 yuan and left without saying goodbye. Her mother came later and demanded that he hand over his daughter. He lost his father at the age of five, and it was not easy to marry a wife, so the matter of divorce is not true. Last night, his wife took a package of wool yarn and went out. He saw it, grabbed her, and slapped her twice. His mother-in-law's injury was caused by cutting herself with broken glass and falsely accusing him of stabbing her with a knife. He asked for judgment. The witness, Hu Agu, stated that he is a neighbor of the defendant and they are both foreign garment workers. He knows something about the defendant's marital disputes. His wife, Yao, often does not return late at night and he does not know what she is doing outside. The defendant often scolds her and she often runs away, so he asked her mother to come to Shanghai to make it clear that he would not be responsible for her disappearance in the future. Their quarrels have been going on for several months. Yao Ni's injury was not caused by the defendant with a knife. Judge Fu Lin considered the circumstances of the case to be bizarre, with both parties claiming to have affairs and unwilling to divorce, so he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and the hearing postponed for further investigation. The two women were taken by court officials to the forensic office to examine their wounds to determine what caused Yao Ni's arm and neck injuries. The defendant's letters should be brought to the next hearing.</p>

Qichun and Guangji, Hubei Since its establishment in 1925, the Qichun and Guangji Native Place Association in Shanghai has provided much relief to fellow villagers in Shanghai. However, in recent years, due to frequent natural disasters and man-made calamities in Hubei Province, more and more refugees have come to Shanghai. The association, due to economic and other reasons, has been unable to provide as much relief as it would like. The persons in charge of the association, Song Fuhua, Cheng Deshui, etc., deeply regret this. They have joined forces with fellow villagers from military, political, academic, and business circles to expand the scale of the association and promote charity in order to prevent fellow villagers in Shanghai from becoming destitute. It was agreed that Minister Guo Taiqi would promote the initiative before he left for England, and Wu Xiangwu, Guo Baodong, and others successively sent letters of support. A few days ago, representatives of the association, Cheng Deshui, Wu Ding, Wu Jingtang, Guo Taijun, etc., went to Yangxingzhen to visit President Ju Juesheng, to discuss the expansion plan and explain its necessity. President Ju expressed extreme support and donated 100 yuan to cover the initial expenses. Despite his busy schedule, he gave instructions on the plan, showing his enthusiasm for his fellow villagers. It is said that during the expansion period, members from all walks of life have enthusiastically provided assistance, and the future development of the association is expected to be optimistic.</p>

<h3>Reading [Mr. Ma Yinchu's Second Discussion on Abolishing the Taels and Changing to Yuan, In Response to Mr. Wu Jingxiong] by Wang Zhaoye</h3>
<p>I read in the newspaper Mr. Ma Yinchu's second discussion on abolishing taels and changing to yuan, in response to Mr. Wu Jingxiong. The article was thousands of words long. After reading it, I realized that Mr. Ma is a learned and knowledgeable man, truly worthy of being called an economist of our time, and he is truly admirable. However, Mr. Ma's response to the questions raised by Mr. Wu included phrases such as "I fear there is no solution for ten thousand generations" and "Must we wait until after the country is destroyed before the opportunity arises?" This borders on emotional argument and does not truly answer the questions raised by Mr. Wu. Furthermore, in his essay, Mr. Ma labeled Mr. Wu as "driving in reverse" and "anti-evolution," which seems to lack the calm and rational attitude of a scholar engaged in research and exploration. This is not what we expect from Mr. Ma. Overall, Mr. Ma's argument for abolishing taels and changing to yuan is that the time is now ripe, and it is necessary to abolish and change. Mr. Wu's argument, on the other hand, is that the time to abolish taels and change to yuan has not yet arrived, but he does not fundamentally oppose it. Therefore, the focus of the dispute between Mr. Ma and Mr. Wu is the timing of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, not whether the anomalous system of both silver taels and silver yuan should coexist. This is perfectly clear. Mr. Ma's essay discusses how beneficial it would be to abolish taels and change to yuan, and how harmful it is not to do so, but he glosses over the issue of timing. Does Mr. Ma believe this answer is sufficient, or does it fail to satisfy our expectations? I venture to inquire of Mr. Ma about some of the points in his response to Mr. Wu that are not entirely clear: (1) Mr. Ma stated that Mr. Wu's claim that abolishing taels and changing to yuan is not the right time when internal affairs are not in order and foreign affairs are not well managed is like arguing whether the mother hen or the egg came first, and that it is a mystery that no one can solve for ten thousand generations. I believe this analogy is inappropriate. From a national perspective, the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan is merely one aspect of internal affairs. Everyone knows that the country's internal affairs are not in order. A national census has not been completed, and there are no statistics on the types and quantities of products. Yet, Mr. Ma seems to view the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, which is a part of internal affairs, as if the country will be destroyed if it is not implemented immediately. This is making a mountain out of a molehill, focusing on the trivial while neglecting the important. Secondly, Mr. Wu's argument that the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan must wait until foreign affairs are well managed is also reasonable. This is evidenced by the January 28th Incident, where the lack of a uniform silver tael and silver yuan system made it difficult to apply exchange rates. At that time, the whole country was in a panic, and those with shallow national concepts even tried to deposit their money in foreign banks. Because silver taels were a virtual standard, it was easier to restrict their circulation than silver yuan. At that time, the crackdown on exchange rate transfers among businesses was illogical in theory, but effective in practice. Thinking about it now, the financial security of Shanghai and the whole country could have been protected, avoiding chaos. Moreover, fewer funds would have flowed into foreign banks in an emergency, and the country would not have been so easily manipulated by foreigners. Isn't this a result of the exchange rate system? How can Mr. Ma still use the mystery analogy? This is one of Mr. Wu's reasons for believing that the time to abolish taels and change to yuan has not yet arrived. Mr. Wu feared that after abolishing taels and changing to yuan, if there is no centralized issuance and insufficient reserves, there may be excessive issuance of paper money and rising prices. This must be said to be a insightful and well-considered concern. However, Mr. Ma stated that there are many reasons for rising prices, and instead of considering ways to prevent this problem, he argued that even if the issuance system is unified and the reserves are sufficient, it is still difficult to guarantee that there will be no excessive issuance. It seems that Mr. Ma is deliberately leaving a loophole for those who would abuse the issuance of paper money, and making the abolition of taels and the change to yuan a preparation for the excessive issuance of paper money. If the result of abolishing taels and changing to yuan is truly like this, then Mr. Ma's words today seem to have an ulterior motive. While we may have some doubts about Mr. Ma's arguments, we dare not hastily say that Mr. Ma is doing something improper. In summary, there is still no good solution for how to prevent the excessive issuance of paper money after changing to yuan. This is the second reason Mr. Wu believes the time to abolish taels and change to yuan has not yet arrived. Mr. Ma also said that after Germany's defeat in World War I, paper money tended to be over-issued. However, China has had frequent civil wars for years, and there have been opportunities for over-issuance everywhere. If there were only a unified currency standard system, I fear that the rampant war for nearly twenty years would have long caused the paper money situation to become unimaginable. Mr. Ma repeatedly cited evidence to dispel doubts, but in the end, the more evidence he cited, the more confused the readers became, leading them to believe that the good regulations of the United States and France are insufficient to restrain abuses, so it is better to maintain the status quo for the time being, wait for the opportunity, and then seek reform. This is the third reason Mr. Wu believes that the time to abolish taels and change to yuan has not yet arrived. Mr. Ma also compared the silver yuan to a wife and the silver tael to a concubine, saying that the wife has a respected position, like the silver yuan having legal status, while the concubine has no legal basis, like the silver tael. Mr. Ma then asked Mr. Wu a serious question about abolishing the wife to establish the concubine, or abolishing the concubine to honor the wife. I believe that the wife should not be abolished, just as the silver yuan must be commonly used. There is no need for explanation. However, to base the concubine's position purely on legal grounds and not allow her to exist for even a moment is a stubborn and unreasonable argument. Even if Mr. Ma himself does not have a concubine, can all of Mr. Ma's relatives and friends who have concubines wake up in the middle of the night, slap the table, stomp their feet, and banish their concubines without delay? The word "concubine" has existed for a long time. This anomalous system cannot be resolved in a day or two, but it is also not necessary to exist permanently. It is necessary to allow time, gradually eliminate it, and dig out the root causes of this system to prevent abuses. The issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan today is similar. This is the fourth reason Mr. Wu believes that the time to abolish taels and change to yuan has not yet arrived. In summary, the four points where Mr. Ma refutes Mr. Wu are precisely the points where Mr. Ma fails to justify himself. This is why we cannot help but take a bystander's stance and offer a suggestion to Mr. Ma. As for Mr. Wu's argument that the current paper money cannot circulate throughout the country and that this is an obstacle to unifying the currency system, Mr. Ma said that this is putting the cart before the horse. I cannot help but say that Mr. Wu's argument is wrong. Our argument is not to act as a judge between Mr. Wu and Mr. Ma. Those who are right will be seen as right, and those who are wrong will not escape public opinion. Furthermore, Mr. Ma argued that the decline of China's rural economy, the concentration of funds in cities, and the decline of urban commerce are related to politics, but can also be unrelated to politics. He cited England and the United States as examples, even though the politics of the United States have been on track for some time, the rural economy has declined, wheat cannot be sold, and funds are concentrated in London and New York without a place to be used, and recessionary phenomena can be seen everywhere. In order to overthrow Mr. Wu's argument, Mr. Ma actually relieved our government of the responsibility of failing to protect industries. Furthermore, this came from the mouth of an economist, so the government will have even more reason to ignore the appeals of the common people in the future. What is the sin of this? Moreover, the recession of industry and commerce in England and the United States is entirely due to overproduction. On the other hand, this is not the case in our country. Our country's products were originally dominated by silk and tea, but now tea is equivalent to zero, and silk is about to disappear. As for miscellaneous grains, fur, and other sporadic products, ask the export companies, those that have stopped operating have stopped, and those that have reduced have reduced. Although the foreign market is poor, it is also due to the failure to pay attention to the quality of products over the years. As for silk, the European and American markets have already been occupied by the Japanese. Even if our people want to catch up quickly, they are afraid it is too late. Moreover, the government does not care about the exhaustion of production, but only focuses on exhaustive taxation. This is the government's policy. Once the market declines, people only seek to sell at low prices, not caring about planting in other years. This is also the mentality of the people. Today, our country's products have neither accurate statistics nor appropriate distribution. Once they decline, they become exhausted, unlike countries such as England and the United States, which decline due to overproduction. The methods of remedy, such as restricting their products or promoting sales abroad, are effective measures to protect production. This cannot but be attributed to the ability of the British and American governments to implement their policies of protecting production, and their people are also able to self-consciously remedy the situation. On the other hand, what about our country? The decline of our country's industry, commerce, and rural economy cannot be compared with that of countries such as England and the United States. This is perfectly clear. Furthermore, the last paragraph of Mr. Ma's article contains points of contribution to the government authorities. Regardless of whether the theories and methods are suitable, they are suggestions. The so-called "governance is shared by public opinion," and Mr. Ma is at most one of the public opinions. However, the last sentence of his conclusion says that the government should "do it quickly, do it practically, do it firmly, and proceed slowly." This tone directly seeks to obliterate everything with one's own opinion and force the government to implement it so that others cannot interject. In this case, Mr. Ma has lost the attitude of a scholar studying and exploring the truth.</p>

<h3>Reporting Two Things to Everyone and Answering a Few Questions</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Today, I would like to say a few words to everyone. Before speaking, I already feel very apologetic, because since this publication was reorganized, it has received enthusiastic support from everyone, and many people have contributed articles, which has allowed this publication to receive a lot of positive reviews in society. This is all thanks to everyone's love for this publication and the results of their enthusiastic and carefully crafted work. What I am most worried about is that the space in this publication is limited, and on average, we receive thirty or forty letters of submissions every day. Even if there are excellent and well-written articles, they are often delayed due to excessive backlog, and there is no way to publish them in a timely manner, which is equivalent to throwing everyone's carefully crafted articles into the ocean. This is such an uneasy thing. We have published notices three times to temporarily suspend submissions, but we have not been forgiven, and submissions continue to arrive one after another. From this, we can see how deeply everyone loves this publication, which makes us feel terrified. Now, there are two trivial matters to report and answer as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Articles on improving society should have a systematic record. Someone made this request. I also felt this way when I started editing this publication. However, the submitted articles are complex, and the letters we receive do not come at the same time. If we were to publish only one issue after discussing and concluding, and then publish other issues, it would be boring for readers to publish the same issue every day. Furthermore, some issues are easy to resolve, while others are not. There are also many difficult situations. For example, when the government calls a meeting or various groups call a meeting, they solicit the opinions of all members in advance, and then compile all the proposals into a systematic system before submitting them to the meeting for discussion. The discussion on education issues in this publication cannot follow this procedure. This is a difficult matter.</p>
<p>2.  Some contributors often request that their original manuscripts be returned if they are not published. However, as mentioned earlier, we receive so many submissions. If we cannot publish them today, more will continue to be added tomorrow. After accumulating batch after batch, it is like looking for a needle in a haystack to return the original manuscripts. For example, we have already accumulated more than one hundred articles on the issue of improving society. It is really impossible to organize them. It is best to ask everyone to temporarily delay submitting articles in order to clear the backlog. In the future, if you have articles that you do not need to be returned, please do not send them. Please forgive us for this difficulty. For example, if someone sends an article that is absolutely unusable, we will return it immediately. However, if the article has some value and is worth publishing, we have to keep it for the time being and wait for the opportunity to publish it. Who knew that once it was set aside, it would never be published. I have to tell everyone about this difficult situation.</p>
<p>3.  Most of the contributors to this publication are young students, but there are also some who dropped out of school midway or are employees in companies. Therefore, some of you are not complacent or send letters expressing your desire to be disciples or ask to be introduced to correspondence schools to make further progress in your studies. This situation is very pitiful. However, I am so ignorant that I do not have the qualifications to be a teacher for others. It is also difficult to introduce you because I have little contact with various fields. I am completely ignorant of how many correspondence schools there are in Shanghai, which are good, and which are bad. This is also something that I cannot fulfill your request.</p>

<h3>Passing Zhabei</h3>
<p>— Chen Shizhi</p>
<p>Yesterday, I passed Zhabei by car. The barren hills after the war were desolate and filled with sadness. I could not bear to linger. I wanted to find my old home in Hongda Lane, but it had already turned into scorched earth.</p>
<p>Pointing to the ruined walls, I spoke of the calamity and ashes,</p>
<p>The desolate scene filled my eyes, and I could not bear to linger.</p>
<p>I wanted to find the old fortress, but I pitied the scorched earth.</p>
<p>The remaining years of my life are filled with worries and sorrows.</p>
<h3>Feelings</h3>
<p>Sighing at the ups and downs of the vast officialdom,</p>
<p>Talking about the changes of the world, my hatred turned deeper.</p>
<p>Five years of drifting were like a dream,</p>
<p>Ten thousand misfortunes surrounded me as I ascended here.</p>
<p>When feeling the times, I should recite Du Fu's poems,</p>
<p>When worrying about the country, I should chant Qu Yuan's lyrics.</p>
<p>Following the ancestors' teachings has now ended,</p>
<p>And I will entrust my sorrows to the Yaoqin.</p>

<p>— Bai Hong</p>
<p>In large cities, fires often occur. In case of emergency, major companies and factories have recently installed a new type of fire extinguisher. This fire extinguisher is a sealed cylindrical metal can containing fire extinguishing chemicals. It is very convenient to use. Just turn the can upside down and hit it hard on the floor, or twist the spiral at the top of the can, and a gas will immediately spray out of the tube. Wherever this gas shoots, the fire will be extinguished, which is extremely effective. The method of making this thing is actually very simple, it is just a simple carbon dioxide generator. Carbon dioxide, commonly known as carbonic acid gas, is a gas that cannot support combustion. We know that there is a kind of gas in the air that can help combustion, and fire encounters it to produce strong combustion. But once carbonic acid gas surrounds the fire, isolating it from the oxygen in the air, the fire will immediately go out. You can use the following method to make a simple fire extinguisher and try it out:</p>
<p>Use a large wide-mouthed bottle and a water bottle (this bottle must be able to fit into the large bottle): some sodium bicarbonate (ie baking soda): some hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid: some good metal wire: a sharp-pointed glass tube: a rubber stopper. Now, you fill one-third of the large bottle with sodium bicarbonate. Fill the small bottle with hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, then use metal wire to tighten the small bottle and suspend it in the large bottle, but do not submerge the mouth of the small bottle in the sodium bicarbonate to prevent the sodium bicarbonate from mixing with the hydrochloric acid. At this moment, you hang the metal wire suspending the small bottle on the mouth of the large bottle, and tightly seal the mouth of the large bottle with a rubber stopper. There is a hole in the center of the rubber stopper, and a sharp-pointed glass tube is inserted into the hole. The length of the tube inserted into the bottle is such that it will not be submerged by hydrochloric acid and sodium bicarbonate when the bottle is turned upside down. This simple fire extinguisher is thus successful. You light a match or candle and turn the bottle over so that the hydrochloric acid mixes with the sodium bicarbonate. Put the fire to the mouth of the sharp-pointed glass tube and watch, gas comes out of the tube, and the fire immediately goes out when it encounters this gas. Originally, at this time, hydrochloric acid mixed with bicarbonate, a chemical reaction occurred, releasing a large amount of carbonic acid gas, extinguishing the fire. The internal structure of a real new fire extinguisher is exactly the same as this. It is made by using these two chemicals to combine and generate an acid gas. This fire extinguisher is most effective for extinguishing fires involving oil and wine. Because these liquids cannot be extinguished by water when they burn.</p>
<p>Fire extinguishers should be placed in the most convenient place in the home, and you must learn how to use them. In times of great urgency, you will not be flustered and at a loss. When applying it, you should shoot this gas on top of the fire, because it is heavier than air. You must not breathe this gas either.</p>
<p>If you are unfortunately surrounded by fire, do not panic, identify the location of the stairs and the escape route. If possible, it is best to wet your clothes and cover your mouth and nose to breathe, and then crawl on the floor. The brave ones use ropes to tie up the bed, pull the rope and escape from the window. If you have to jump down from a high building, then first throw down bedding, carpets, etc., and then jump on them, the danger will be less.</p>
<p>Be careful of the fire in your home, all disasters can be avoided, and all fire extinguishers will not be needed.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Issue of Gender Equality</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>After reading Zhenjun's issue of gender equality, it is indeed as Zhenjun said ["still a pending case, not yet resolved."] However, after reading Ms. Zu'e's (I believe she is a lady) reply to Zhenjun's issue of gender equality, I have even stronger feelings about this, and I dare not take the liberty to express my humble opinion, in order to have a proper understanding of this issue.</p>
<p>I fundamentally feel that the grand arguments of both of you only involve some details, superficial aspects, and do not grasp the backbone. In other words, both of you have made errors in the major premise, so the conclusions that are deduced are also vague and make people unable to grasp the truth. Looking back at history, the history of true gender equality probably only existed in the most primitive communist society (the hunting and gathering era). In the most closed environment, men and women did the same very simple work to satisfy their very simple lives, which can be considered true equality. Later, as a result of plunder and single competition, the system of private ownership gradually formed. Women were not as strong as men due to physiological and other environmental factors, so women were forced out of the line of equality. In feudal society, women were appendages of men!</p>
<p>Slaves, that is an undoubted fact. Even in today's capitalist society, in general, women are still appendages and playthings of men. But at the same time, you can also find the fact that men are playthings for women. This is a deformed phenomenon in a deformed society. Perhaps a small number of men and women have achieved equality, but that is still the smallest number. Ask yourself, in law, women still do not have thorough equal treatment, nor do they have an economic foundation, and they are also bound by social ethics, customary laws, etc. How can women achieve equality in life? Therefore, in my opinion, true gender equality can only be discussed in the new society of the future. As for saying that women write ["Dear Brother"], ["Kiss me"], ["I love you"], and men wear upright clothes, comb their hair smoothly, and worship the cheongsam, this cannot be said to be the behavior of playthings, but rather the expression of love for the opposite sex. Even in the new society of the future, I am afraid that this kind of behavior will not only not disappear, but will become even more popular.</p>
<p>As for Ms. Zu'e saying ["Everything, rights, and obligations can no longer distinguish between men and women: : It has reached the point of gender equality."] I don't know how she is speaking, I am afraid she is wearing colored glasses? And also said: ["As long as we are sincere: : The issue of gender equality can be resolved anytime, anywhere: : Regarding women as still ["women are women"], in this way, the realization will never be realized."] In this way, gender equality is actually a matter of sincerity and concepts. It is truly a great joke. As for Ms. Zu'e's other errors, I will not point them out one by one due to space limitations. In short: True gender equality is entirely based on economic conditions, and economic conditions are related to the social system. Under the economic foundation of women in the current society, it is impossible to achieve true equality with men. At most, only a small number can be discussed. I do not know Zhang Erjun, and I believe that what I have said is fair. I ask Erjun and all members if it is acceptable.</p>

<h3>Gift Giving</h3>
<p>— You Ru</p>
<p>"Ah! It's terrible! Look, this hateful calendar is running particularly fast. Isn't it the fifteenth again today? Fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, ah! Including today, there are only three days left! Aren't you going to plan for that?" the wife said.</p>
<p>"What? What are you talking about? In this extremely bleak family situation, I advise you not to keep saying such startling things," the husband replied blankly.</p>
<p>"Tsk! Tsk! You're really driven to poverty! You may be confused, but people aren't as poor as you! Who wants to say those scary things that look at people's status, but this is the truth! Can you escape it?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! I remember! It's terrible! Are you talking about the gift for the W family?"</p>
<p>"Of course, this is not like rent or firewood and rice bills, where even if people are pressing you hard, they still let you plead poverty once and avoid it twice, and you can still barely cope with it. But as for this:"</p>
<p>"Sigh! Stop talking, stop talking, let's discuss a temporary solution."</p>
<p>"Only:"</p>
<p>":: How? Do you have a solution?"</p>
<p>"I'm ashamed of you, a big man, even a little gift needs his wife to think of a solution."</p>
<p>"Alas! Who says it's a little? The interactions in our company have always been at least two yuan, but considering my relationship with W and my status in the company, this minimum of two yuan is really not enough. Besides, you calculate, how many gifts have we given in the past half month? According to my income, it's already taken up one-third! Yet this is something that cannot be delayed for even a day! What should I do? What should I do?"</p>
<p>"What can I do? Who told you businessmen to love watching the officialdom so much, and make gift-giving so important?"</p>
<p>"Less idle talk, I have to ask you for this matter::"</p>
<p>"Take it! I only have this little bit of jewelry left! Pawn it early or pawn it late, when you're done with it, see what else you can do?"</p>
<p>"Alas!::"</p>
<p>Lamentable</p>
<p>P&gt;A Scene on the Road</p>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>Summer! It has gradually disappeared its ferocity. As the setting sun of early autumn falls, a golden breeze blows in gusts, how refreshing! Suddenly: clang: clang: the sound of gongs and a burst of musical instruments forcefully pierced my eardrums from the noisy voices of people and the rumbling of cars. Ah! A funeral procession is on the road again, I wondered in my heart.</p>
<p>I poked my head out from the counter, and looking through the crowd, I couldn't help but sigh. Ah! No, no, it turned out to be a parade of Taoist priests performing a ritual! Driving away the plague ghosts, they wore pearl crowns on their heads, Taoist robes on their bodies, and held 錂, gongs, flutes, and rattled them. Those Taoist priests' yellow-black faces, plus this nondescript dress, would scare the souls out of you if you saw them in the middle of the night. Behind them followed a group of children, playing mischievously.</p>
<p>At this time, the pedestrians on the road stopped to watch, and the people at work also ran out of the houses, all opening their mouths, pointing east and drawing west, discussing with interest:</p>
<p>"What a pair of big lanterns; and it is also written with the four characters of Lan Meng Sheng Hui," a neighbor named Zhu said to a neighbor named Wang:</p>
<p>"Look! This is a 'See You Get Rich' Wuchang, so lifelike!" Mr. Zhu said again to Mr. Wang: "Have you seen the real one with your own eyes?" Mr. Wang stared at the person who asked this:</p>
<p>"Um:: If I had seen 'See You Get Rich' with my own eyes, I would be fine. ""What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"You are a real idiot, you don't even know this, if we bumped into 'See You Get Rich,' we would immediately kneel down and ask him for money, and he would definitely agree, so being able to see him would make you rich, wouldn't that be good?"</p>
<p>"Bah! You're talking nonsense, where is there such a thing."</p>
<p>"If you don't believe me, then forget it! May I ask, what is a ritual for? Isn't it just to ensure peace and remove plagues?"</p>
<p>"Hey! According to you, what kind of epidemic hospital should be set up? What kind of doctors are needed? Pharmacies and pharmacies, everything is useless, and they can all be closed!"</p>
<p>[:: :::::::::::::::]</p>
<p>"Kang Shi!" A friend shouted: cutting off the words I heard!</p>
