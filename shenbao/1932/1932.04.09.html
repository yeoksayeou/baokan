<h3 id="c1">停戰撤兵會議再容退讓乎彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>中日上海停戰撤兵會議。自集會至今。以日方之百般刁難。毫無誠意。無日不在艱難進行之中。吾人細審日方之意旨。並分析當前之情勢。既曾於七日「前途黯淡之停戰撤兵會議」一評中。指陳會議前途極多暗礁。并陳述吾人對於此次會議之主張。今大會中關於日軍之完全撤兵退一條。日方終無誠意協商解决。而撤退地點則大致已都如日方之願望。日步步進逼。我則節節退讓。日軍撤退期限一點。且亦已在英使所提三項折中辦法之下。關始作讓步之討論。瞻顧前途。危機至多。目前已臨到最後之時機。吾人敢再以嚴正之態度。重申吾人之主張。</p>
<p>此次之停戰撤兵會議。實爲遵依國聯理事會三月四日之决議而產生。國聯四日决議明白說明爲建議中日兩國開始進行「確定停戰」及「日軍撤退」辦法之談判。同時更以我國顏代表在國聯中所聲明之（一）此項談判僅限於有關實行停戰及日軍完全撤退之事件。（二）撤退不得附帶任何條件之兩點。而嚴正詮釋其意義。並嚴正確定此次談判之性質。即「完全撤退」一語。以日使重光之詢問。亦經我郭外次明白解釋爲「完全撤退至一月三十八以前原防。」然而三月二十一日末次預備會議所决定之原則三點。則明白限制我軍防地。日軍仍得駐在租界毘連地帶。是不僅爲違反國聯决議之精神。及顏代表之聲明。抑且爲破壞我領土之完整與政治之獨立。故預備會議之結果。我國即已陷入失敗地位。而日方即已取得交涉初步勝利。</p>
<p>迨會議正式舉行。集議至今。由大會而軍事小組。會停戰協定五條。已通過其四。第三條日軍撤退程序中之撤退地點與撤退日期兩點。乃成爲雙方爭持之焦點。今第一點撤退地點。聞已將如日方之願望而解决。則吾人不能不承認此次談判。我方已步步走入窘境。步步走入日人之圈套。撤退地點既已勢將必至如日人之願望而解决。撤退日期寗又將在英使所提三條折中辦法之下。開始進行讓步之談判耶。</p>
<p>日軍撤退之地點。現既已將决定爲吳淞江灣第四處。設使撤退時間。又將有所謂「期限」之協定。此「期限」究爲「六月」乎。抑將隨所謂圓桌會議之久暫而藉曰延長乎。吾人今敢問在此「期限」中。我方亦將準備參加所謂「圓桌會議」乎。如其參加。則圓桌會議而在大軍壓境之下進行。是何</p>
<p>異於城下之盟。吾人其甘受城下之盟之奇恥大辱乎。</p>
<p>會議之結果既已限制我軍留駐現有地位。復使日軍撤退之領土主權不因撤兵而即恢復。則日軍實爲未撤。我之領土主權實爲未恢復是則我國之參加此次停戰會議。其目的豈僅在於停戰之名耶。</p>
<p>於此。吾人敢聲請我政府一細審當前之利害。並再細審日方之有無和平之誠意。目前已臨到最後之關鍵。絕再無可以讓步之餘地。吾人更敢重提吾人之主張。</p>
<p>㈠不承認日本有條件撤兵。及併軍事問題與政治問題爲一談。　　㈡上海事件與東北事件不容分别談判。</p>
<h3 id="c2">停戰會議昨開小組會 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<p>停戰會議小組會議、昨晨在英領署内舉行於十時起討論、形勢似稍和緩、結果僅擬定日軍撤退後暫駐之吳淞區、至江灣閘北引翔港等處、亦有論及、惟詳細之規定界限、須由小組會出席代表後日晨赴上述地點視察後、再行會勘决定、小組會定今晨十時續開、大會則於今日午後三時舉行、茲分誌其詳情如下、</p>
<h3 id="c3">昨晨會議 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>昨日上午十時、小組會議開始、出席人員仍爲我方郭德華·黃强·日方田代·島田·喜多·西村·梶原·及英參贊桑希爾·美參贊特萊斯台爾·法參贊彭那維泰·意參贊法拉鐵尼等、日方初欲討論蘇州河以南及浦東之華軍駐防情形、我方加以拒絕、旋乃討論日兵暫駐地點、對於吳淞之薀藻浜張華浜等處、滬</p>
<p>東之引翔港·江灣之跑馬廳·殷行閘北之六三花園·日本公墓等均加討論、吳淞方面、因各代表曾於前日午後赴該地視察甚詳、故規定亦較詳、雙方各出紙筆、畫成地圖、爭論多時、始有一小部份之地點、得到同意、惟仍多模稜含糊之處、於是定下星期一（十一日）再赴吳淞江灣引翔港閘北等處視察後、再確定地點、會議定於今晨繼續舉行、</p>
<h3 id="c4">暫駐區域 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>昨晨雙方討論之日軍暫駐區域、共有四處、經探得如下、㈠吳淞方面、在薀藻浜之北、縱橫各二千密達、即二英里左右、南至外馬路附近、西至康家行·及北泗塘河、北及印家宅·孫家樓、東至黃浦江畔、以該區域内有吳淞鎭及淞滬鐵路·同濟大學·中大醫學院·中國公學·等校、均劃出在外、日軍不得駐屯、故原則上雖係一正方形、而實際上則爲一斜長方形、其四圍之界限、則以附近之小河流爲間斷棧、㈡江灣方面自淞滬路東之跑馬廳至殷行鄉屬之、各處面積綫、亦以小河爲界限、㈢引翔港方面、自引翔鄉西北至軍工路之一部分、該處亦爲日軍駐屯地惟滬江大學則不在内、㈣閘北方面爲六三花園、至日本公墓一帶、西以橫浜爲界、東至鐵路等處、大致與前相同以上各處、除吳淞方面較爲詳細外、其餘三處面積綫均未决定、須視察後始定、</p>
<h3 id="c5">今日大會 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>今日午後三時、將舉行正式會議雙方於該會中將先考慮、昨日下午及今晨小組會議討論之地點、并再議前日開會中、英使藍浦森提出之條件、昨日日人方面消息日使重光、對於第一條之日軍於六個月内完全退至租界及越界築路、惟屆時須視滬上日僑之生命財產安全如何而定一點、可以允許、則第二條及第三條辦法可勿採用、</p>
<h3 id="c6">昨日公報 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>昨日公報如下、今晨舉行軍事小組委員會、詳細討論四地點、稍有進步、所有各地點之面積、因有一小部份以紙筆示出、故費時甚久、地點大致决定、但須賴當地視察以補助之、明晨十時、小組會議繼續進行、</p>
<h3 id="c7">日方表示態度 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>同意三種條件不能明示日期日聯社八日東京電云、田代參謀長報告七日停戰交涉之三種案件、陸軍中央部對此三案表示同意、</p>

<h3 id="c139">鋼刀九十九 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 張延祥</p>
<p>回憶辛亥革命時。劉伯溫燒餅歌及推背圖傳誦一時。余最喜其中『手執鋼刀九十九。殺盡胡兒方罷休』二句。蓋頗足資鼓勵也。昨又憶及。思索其意義。忽憶瀋案爲九月十八日夜十一點發動。稱爲「九十八案」。唯時已交十九日子時。正符「九十九」之數。滬案發生。十九路軍爲國殺賊。氣吞河山。而三將領之名隱含「九十九」之繼。蔣總指揮之蔣字頭有二個「十」蔡軍長之蔡字頭又二個「十」戴司令之戴字頭有一個「十」。中田字又一「十」。下共字又二個「十」戴司令名戟。下有一個「十」字。頭上一個「十」字則少一畫。可說十減一爲九。總計適符「九十九」。豈偶然哉。蔣總指揮之鼐字。意爲九鼎。蔡軍長之廷字意爲九廷。又隱示九九之數。</p>
<p>第二句胡兒之『胡』字。分爲『古月』二字。可對『今日』。即今之日本也。蔡軍長之楷字右旁爲『比日』。戴司令之戟字含『戈日』。均有日字。與胡兒爲日本相關連。鋼刀則我之大刀隊。與日軍短兵相接也</p>
<h3 id="c140">戰後隨筆 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 鸚哥</p>
<p>滬戰吃緊的時候。美國兵在愛而近路開封路一帶佈滿了鐵絲網。把人家的大門都攔住了。現在滬戰已經轉向了西。槍聲漸遠終於聽不見了。但是愛而近路等地的鐵絲網依然攔住了人家的大門。還没拆卸。居民都要繞道。或是在空隙處鑽進去。當然是很不便利的。可是一個姓高的中年婦人却說。「這斷命鐵絲網不拆也好。用他替小兒子晒晒尿布倒嘸啥」。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>小獅子的母親。每天朝晨提着空籃子出去。到晚總有滿滿的一籃燒焦了的木頭提回家。隔壁的王媽看着眼紅了。問小獅子的母親道。「你往那去搬來這許多木柴。」小獅子的母親却很得意地說。「我也犯了本錢的。每天要買三隻香蕉和一匣香烟給日本兵吃呢。」</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>滬戰以後。閘北的狗比人還多幾倍。我到閘北去。注視狗身上的毛是發着光澤。並用很肥。狗的眼睛是紅的。看見生人。做着虎勢直撲上去。很是凶猛。</p>
<p>生物學上說狗是狼的别種。雖於馴服在人家。可是牠仍然保有狼的根性。誠然誠然。</p>

<p>— 萍</p>
<p>難產之國難會議，會期既一再展緩，會員也分批敦聘，現政府。意態躍躇，據各方情形觀察，預測會議的結果，必難盡如人意，其惟一癓結，就在討論的範圍，僅限於禦侮·救災·綏靖三問題。這三項誠然是當前急務，然而外侮不自今日始，天災兵禍年年有，現政府歷年努力的成績，究有若干可以告慰於民衆？自身也應當深深的反省。所以欲解决今日的國難，在於「化除杜絕合作之黨治，實現全民協力之憲政」這纔是迫切的先决問題。</p>

<p>滬戰與軍器㈢</p>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>手槍</p>
<p>Pis　tol的種類很多。原係意大利所創造。大扺爲防禦與敵接近時用的。且因便利携帶而爲自衛的利器。軍隊用的手槍。還有信號手槍。Signal-Pistol瓦斯手槍。Gass-Pistol新式的自動手槍。可抵輕機關槍的效用。現在各國通常使用足以代表的。爲Velgman式自動手槍。其槍口的口徑。爲七耗六。發射的速度。在一分間有四八○。射達的距離。約八○○米突。這類手槍。東北工廠。能照樣倣造。九一八事變發生後。北大營兵工廠被日軍佔據。聽說失去了幾萬枝。所以他們用中國貨來打中國人。這一點。我們不得不感謝張學良的賜予至於我國原有的手槍。本爲極簡單的鐵製品。好像步槍一樣的。用火藥鐵子。技術既極幼稚。使用亦不很靈。每因引火的銅帽機關（用燐火紙造成。外罩以銅製的蓋）潮濕。即不能發射。且因裝置火藥過多。鐵製槍筒。常常發生爆裂。甲午之役。曾被日軍奪去兩三枝。現今陳列在東京九段上遊龍館内。記者的腦中。到現在還歷歷不忘的。至於這回滬變。在閘北江灣陣地。被我軍截獲的手槍。多爲日本南部式的自動手槍與十四年式的自動手槍。這類手槍。是日本人改良印度副王送給豐臣秀吉與貝路里Beloly送給的六連發手槍。參照Velgman式所改良的。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第四回　婚約逼人來游移自擾　宼氛掠地去釁始重開誰知安玉田被伊糾纒得過久。無心感領盛情。反膩煩這種瑣碎。只冷冷的回答道。算了罷。時候已不早。我也就快要睡了。等我明早起來自己換罷。似這般類于下逐客令的拒絕。殆無異于將一杓冰水潑在伊沸熱的心情上。自使伊掃興不淺。然而尙未成婚的愛人。被此總須保持着一點客氣的。况且女子在禮防的外表上。還更要自尊自重一些。當下就不便表示爭持。尤不能再行留逗。無意識地側耳一聽。院落裏寂靜無聲。全公庽的隣客們大概都已入了睡鄉了。再看那書桌上的鐘。針尖已快走到一點。悵悵然發出極不自然的苦笑來道。不覺的就摸索到這般晚了呢。不獨你應當早些安歇。連我也就要走了。好在你我的事情。已談得有了頭緒。明天你只請魏先生作介紹人。那還不容易說妥嗎。到晚上我仍來這裏看你。一切還好再談呢。安玉田也不再挽留。便也親身送伊到大門外。並替你雇車。伊臨行還再三叮囑他。明晚務必在公庽中等候着伊。他没口子的只答應是。就把伊打發走了。回得房來。忙着就上床攤被睡覺。可是總像有一件事似一塊大石頭般橫亘在他的胸中。使他翻來覆去不以安然入睡。他自然也思索過。這就是李問霞逼他宣布婚約的那件事。但婚約是出于自願而早已秘密對伊口頭訂妥的。問心實并無翻悔或推諉的意思。但很奇怪的在有些不可解之間。又似乎老覺得是不願宣布。并不肯急於如此定局。然而這又究竟是期待些什麽呢。只消一閉上眼來。那個名貴華美的梁笑雲。倩影兒就在他腦幕中湧現了。不過梁笑雲齊大非偶。他不是不知道的。他對於伊實不應該有什期待。只是冥冥中總似有一種神或魔在逼促着他。老是死不下這條心。而必須姑且期待着。縱然明知無益。郤總以爲將來必有奇妙的機會的到來。而可以得着意外的收穫。</p>

<p>惟十九路軍曾有一朝「養兵千日用在一朝」這是一句有經騐有理智的古話，但是既說養兵，天然不能無費，故兵費原是國家正當支出的大宗經費，也是人民應當供給的一種負擔·</p>
<p>昨見京電，全國軍費，經政府核定每月爲一千萬元，由財部籌撥，若照這電大致看來，原不是一椿希奇古怪的事，不過我算算，每月爲一千萬元，則每年爲一萬二千萬元，不知政府每年全部收入有幾，我不曉得，不過我想起，政府中尙有所謂敎育費實業費等等，關係亦十分重要，不知政府每月議定若干，倘也照軍費每月一千萬元一千萬元的支配，是否政府有此相當收入·</p>

<p>在閘北吳淞砲聲停止的第二天，我到閘北去一看，使我痛心欲絕，在平時熙熙攘攘的街市里巷，到處都是些華人的屍體，前天，我又去環覩一週，這些屍體固然不見了，但在附近的田地上，都是淺墳壘壘，行經其旁，空氣與他處大别，我因此想到，這些忠厚的華人，固已被敵人的槍砲殘殺了，但是他們很不願意遺留在人間的屍毒，却在那隨着漸漸溫暖天氣發瀉了·我於是做這篇屍毒，一方面爲死者表示哀慨，一方面爲對日奮鬥者以作參考·</p>
<p>動物或人體腐敗時，其中所含的氣質有機物，經一種細菌作用，而生成各種屍毒，這是一類有鹼性的毒物，其毒性的强弱各不相同，據科柏逹的研究，肉體腐敗二四至二八小時後，就有屍毒發生，毒性最强，所含毒素呌紐林（VelgmnNaeurine)至五六日後，則毒性較弱，屍毒的化學組織雖未確定，但用植物鹼試騐法，皆起顯著之反應，故法化學家檢騐屍體毒物時，必用植物鹼法行多種試騐後，而决定死者生前中某種植物鹼而死，</p>
<p>屍毒對生物所起之生理反應，往往與植物鹼不同，故中毒致死者頗多，因屍毒所含之主要毒素紐林，毒素甚强·其中毒之生理作用，在能使神經系瘋癱及心臓惡化，所起病徴，爲眩晕，嘔吐，瀉痢，瞳孔放大，脈搏微弱，四肢寒冷，卒至週身麻痺，喪失知覺而死，至於解屍毒的方法。通常皆用阿特洛品，因阿特洛品，能與紐林起相反作用·</p>

<p>有許多人見了這個題目，一定覺得很奇怪，無線電是近代物質文明·科學發達的最新結晶·因着無線電的發明，而予人們以不少便利；每個國家都恃以爲軍事上交通上的利器，怎麽是亡國的利器呢？並且英美各國無線電都比中國發達，怎麽他們不亡國，反因而日臻富强，到中國來，便變成亡國的利器呢？</p>
<p>無論一件什麽事，總逃不了好壞兩方面的·譬如現代種種科學的新發明，在好的方面，固然是科學愈發達，物質愈文明，得到不少的享受，但是從壞的方面看，却科學愈發達，殺人愈便利，人類愈臻野蠻，恰是相反，無線電亦是如此，善利用之·則日臻富强，不善利用之，便是亡國的利器·</p>
<p>在歐美各國，差不多每家都裝有無線電·他們的目的是要使全國消息靈通，所以一出大事，即由無線電台播送，一霎時全國的人民都知道了·其次便是請名人演講，使人民增加智識·娱樂是最不注重的一個目的，但是中國恰與此相反，娱樂是最要的目的，每天播送的，完全是娱樂的節目·至於名人演講，或國家大事，則着實難得·像一二八這樣的事，日本在一小時内，全國都已知道了，中國直要到明天翻開報紙，才知道，這不是一件顯而易見的事實嗎？</p>
<p>因爲中國的裝置無線電的目的是娱樂，所以一班資產階級同有閒階級的人們，從前還要走出來才能得到視聽之樂的，現在只要裝了無線電，連大門都不必出，可以得到種種的娱樂，於是在家鎭日的陪着妻妾，姿情淫樂，天大的事，也不管了，眞是一機在手，萬念俱空·幸虧現在中國還不能人人裝着無線電，不然，豈非國家大事，没人管賬了嗎？此時不亡，更待何時？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Will the Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Conference Allow Further Concessions to Japan? <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Shanghai Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Conference, since its inception, has been proceeding with difficulty due to the Japanese side's various acts of obstruction and lack of sincerity. Having carefully examined the Japanese side's intentions and analyzed the current situation, we pointed out in our commentary on the 7th, "The Dim Prospects of the Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Conference," that there were many hidden reefs ahead for the conference, and we also stated our views on this conference. Now, regarding the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, the Japanese side has no intention of negotiating a resolution, while the withdrawal locations have largely been as desired by the Japanese side. Japan is pressing forward step by step, while we are retreating step by step. On the matter of the deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops, discussions on making concessions have even begun under the three compromise proposals put forward by the British ambassador. Looking ahead, there are many crises. We have now reached the final moment. We dare to reaffirm our position with a solemn attitude.</p>
<p>This Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Conference was actually produced in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations Council on March 4. The League of Nations' March 4 resolution clearly stated that it suggested that China and Japan begin negotiations on "determining a ceasefire" and "Japanese troop withdrawal" measures. At the same time, the meaning was solemnly interpreted and the nature of the negotiations was strictly defined by Representative Yan's statement to the League of Nations: (1) This negotiation is limited to matters related to the implementation of a ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops; (2) The withdrawal must not be subject to any conditions. That is, the phrase "complete withdrawal." In response to an inquiry from Japanese envoy Shigemitsu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo also clearly explained that it meant "complete withdrawal to the original defenses before January 38." However, the three principles decided at the last preparatory meeting on March 21 clearly restricted the defense of our troops, and Japanese troops were still allowed to be stationed in the area adjacent to the concession. This is not only a violation of the spirit of the League of Nations resolution and Representative Yan's statement, but also a destruction of the integrity of our territory and the independence of our politics. Therefore, as a result of the preparatory meeting, our country has already fallen into a position of failure, and the Japanese side has achieved an initial victory in the negotiations.</p>
<p>Since the official commencement of the conference and the assembly to this day, from the general meeting to the military sub-group, four of the five ceasefire agreement articles have been passed. The withdrawal location and withdrawal date in the third article on the Japanese troop withdrawal procedure have become the focus of contention between the two sides. Now that the first point, the withdrawal location, is said to be resolved as desired by the Japanese side, we cannot but admit that our side has been walking into a difficult situation step by step in this negotiation, and walking into the Japanese trap step by step. Now that the withdrawal location is bound to be resolved as desired by the Japanese side, will the withdrawal date also begin to be negotiated for concessions under the three compromise proposals put forward by the British ambassador?</p>
<p>Now that the location of the Japanese troop withdrawal has been decided as Wusong Jiangwan, and the fourth location, supposing there is an agreement on a so-called "deadline" for the withdrawal time, will this "deadline" ultimately be "June?" Or will it be extended on the pretext of the duration of the so-called round table conference? We now dare to ask, during this "deadline," will our side also be prepared to participate in the so-called "round table conference?" If we participate, then the round table conference will be conducted under the pressure of a large army.</p>
<p>What is the difference from the oath of surrender under the city? How can we willingly suffer the extraordinary shame and humiliation of the oath of surrender under the city?</p>
<p>Since the result of the conference has restricted our troops from remaining in their existing positions, and has allowed the territorial sovereignty of the territory from which the Japanese troops are withdrawing to not be restored immediately due to the troop withdrawal, then the Japanese troops have actually not withdrawn, and the territorial sovereignty of our country has actually not been restored. Then, is the purpose of our country's participation in this ceasefire conference merely the name of a ceasefire?</p>
<p>Here, we dare to implore our government to carefully consider the current advantages and disadvantages, and to carefully consider whether the Japanese side has the sincerity for peace. We have now reached the final key moment, and there is absolutely no room for further concessions. We dare to reiterate our position.</p>
<p>(1) We do not recognize Japan's conditional troop withdrawal, and we do not combine military issues with political issues for discussion. (2) The Shanghai incident and the Northeast incident cannot be negotiated separately.</p>

<p>After Determining the Provisional Stationing Location of Japanese Troops in the Wusong Area, Representatives Will Go to Jiangwan Yinxiang Zhabei to Conduct a Joint Inspection. The Sub-Group Will Continue to Meet This Morning, and the General Assembly Will Continue to Meet This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Ceasefire Conference sub-group meeting was held in the British Consulate yesterday morning, starting at 10:00 a.m. The situation seemed slightly more moderate. As a result, only the Wusong area where the Japanese troops would temporarily station after their withdrawal was proposed. Jiangwan, Zhabei Yinxiang Port, etc. were also discussed. However, the detailed regulations and boundaries must be determined by the representatives attending the sub-group meeting after inspecting the above-mentioned locations on the morning of the day after tomorrow. The sub-group meeting is scheduled to continue at 10:00 a.m. this morning, and the general assembly will be held at 3:00 p.m. this afternoon. The details are recorded separately as follows.</p>

<p>The sub-group meeting started at 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning. The attendees were still Guo Dehua and Huang Qiang from our side, Tashiro, Shimada, Kita, Nishimura, and Kajiwara from the Japanese side, and British Counselor Sansom, American Counselor Trice, French Counselor Penavete, and Italian Counselor Falatiani. The Japanese side initially wanted to discuss the garrison situation of the Chinese troops south of the Suzhou River and in Pudong, but our side refused. Then, the temporary stationing location of the Japanese troops was discussed. The Yunzaobang Zhanghuabang area of Wusong, Hu</p>
<p>The Yinxiang Port of Dong, the racecourse of Jiangwan, the No. 63 Garden of Yinxing Zhabei, and the Japanese Cemetery were all discussed. On the Wusong side, because the representatives had gone to the location for a very detailed inspection on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the regulations were also more detailed. Both sides took out paper and pens, drew maps, and argued for a long time before a small part of the location was agreed upon. However, there were still many ambiguous and vague areas. Therefore, it was decided to go to Wusong Jiangwan Yinxiang Port Zhabei and other places for inspection again next Monday (the 11th) before determining the location. The meeting was scheduled to continue this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Temporary Stationing Area <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese military's temporary stationing areas discussed by both sides yesterday morning totaled four locations, which were explored as follows: (1) In the Wusong area, 2,000 meters each vertically and horizontally north of Yunzaobang, which is about two English miles, south to the vicinity of the outer road, west to Kangjiahang and Beisitang River, north to Yinjiazhai and Sunjialou, and east to the Huangpu River. The area includes Wusong Town and the Songhu Railway, Tongji University, China Medical College, China Public School, and other schools, which are all excluded, and the Japanese army must not station troops. Therefore, in principle, it is a square, but in reality, it is an oblique rectangle. The boundary of its four sides is intermittently stacked with nearby small rivers. (2) In Jiangwan, from the racecourse east of Songhu Road to Yinxing Township, the area lines are also bounded by small rivers. (3) In Yinxiang Port, from the northwest of Yinxiang Township to a part of Jungong Road, this place is also a Japanese military garrison, but Shanghai University is not included. (4) In Zhabei, from No. 63 Garden to the Japanese Cemetery area, the west is bounded by Yokohama, and the east is roughly the same as before to the railway and other places. The area lines in the other three locations have not been determined, except for the Wusong area, which is more detailed. They must be determined after inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Today's General Assembly <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The formal meeting will be held at 3:00 p.m. today. Both sides will first consider the locations discussed at the sub-group meeting yesterday afternoon and this morning, and then discuss the conditions proposed by British Ambassador Lampson at the meeting the day before yesterday. According to Japanese sources yesterday, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu said that the first condition is that the Japanese army will completely withdraw to the concession and the cross-border road within six months, but the second and third conditions can be waived if the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in Shanghai is determined at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Yesterday's Bulletin <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's bulletin was as follows: The Military Sub-Committee was held this morning to discuss the four locations in detail, and there was some progress. The area of all locations was demonstrated on paper, so it took a long time. The locations were generally determined, but they must rely on local inspections to supplement them. The sub-group meeting will continue at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Japanese Side Expresses Its Attitude <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Agreeing to Three Conditions Cannot Clearly Indicate the Date. Jiji News Agency, Tokyo, 8th dispatch, states that Chief of Staff Tashiro reported on the three cases of the ceasefire negotiations on the 7th. The Army Central Department expressed its agreement with these three cases.</p>
<p>Jiji News Agency, Tokyo, 8th dispatch, states that the Shanghai ceasefire negotiations have made no progress due to China's insistence that the Japanese side clearly indicate the withdrawal period. The Army Ministry headquarters believes that the Japanese side absolutely cannot clearly indicate the withdrawal date until the safety of Shanghai is ensured at the round table conference.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Sichuan Association Strongly Rejects Compromise Measures <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's Japanese residents are all safe. It is easy for Japanese soldiers to come, so why is it difficult to withdraw quickly? In short, it is a pretext for Japanese aggression. The supervisory authorities refuse to discuss it. A letter from the Sichuan Shanghai Association states that the whole of Shanghai's civil groups should be informed that the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference is in a stalemate. Some people are openly siding with the Japanese side and proposing so-called compromise measures: (1) The Japanese side should make a separate statement, the wording of which is: "If the local order in Shanghai is completely restored and it can be guaranteed that the overseas Chinese are safe, the Japanese army hopes to completely withdraw within six months." (2) China and Japan should make a joint statement, that is, after the Japanese side's above-mentioned statement, add an accompanying statement from our side, the wording of which is: "China believes that this agreement cannot take effect until the Japanese army has completely withdrawn." (3) China should make a separate statement, the wording of which is: "Before the Japanese army withdraws to the public concession, it is considered to be in violation of the League of Nations resolution, and this agreement cannot take effect." The Japanese side has recognized this measure and wants to force China to recognize it, but the Chinese representative has not refused and has already asked the government for instructions. After reading the above, the association cannot help but be astonished. If all these measures can be recognized, it would be better to simply cede Songhu to Japan, which would be even more pleasant. First, if the Japanese side really has the sincerity to withdraw troops, it can be withdrawn completely in two or three days, so why does it take six months? If it takes six months to withdraw, has it ever taken so long for them to send troops to Shanghai? However, our representatives also do not hesitate to deceive themselves and openly discuss the issue of their troop withdrawal time. This is astonishing. Second, what kind of withdrawal method is used as the standard for the troop withdrawal time, which is set at six months? Moreover, it is said that the withdrawal will only begin when the local order is completely restored and it can be guaranteed that the overseas Chinese are safe. That is, if the Japanese side does not admit that the local order has been completely restored and that the overseas Chinese can be guaranteed, it can not withdraw troops for a day without bearing any responsibility. Third, Shanghai has already opened the market and the concessions have already been lifted, so what order has not been restored? What is so-called unrestored is only the Zhabei Jiangwan Wusong area occupied by the Japanese army. Since they have indulged vagrants and traitors to do evil in these areas, we have no way to intervene. May I ask, if the Japanese army does not withdraw, how can we plan to restore it? Fourth, the Japanese side's so-called guarantee of the safety of overseas Chinese is the pretext it used for this invasion of Shanghai, and the Japanese overseas Chinese in Shanghai have never been unsafe. This is a matter of fact and cannot be allowed to be fabricated. If we admit to guaranteeing overseas Chinese, the Japanese side can get rid of its military responsibility for attacking Shanghai this time. Fifth, although our side also states that the bilateral agreement cannot take effect if the Japanese army does not completely withdraw, this agreement can bind us at least not to use force to recover Songhu within six months. Because the Japanese side can excuse that six months have not yet passed, and how can we know that they will not withdraw their troops? If we want to use troops, we will be blamed for destroying peace. Sixth, if the Japanese army does not withdraw after six months, we can use force to recover Songhu, but after they have made six months of long-term military preparations in Songhu, even if we can counterattack, it will be difficult to succeed. If this is recognized, it is no different from raising a tiger to devour oneself. Seventh, the Japanese side does not make a statement responsible for deciding when to withdraw the troops, but says that it hopes to withdraw under certain conditions. This is completely insincere and fundamentally violates the League of Nations resolution. What agreement and statement do we still have with them? Knowing that this agreement statement is invalid, we deliberately do it. I don't know who we want to deceive. The above seven points are the critical juncture for the survival of Shanghai. A little carelessness will lead to self-inflicted harm. I dare to ask all my compatriots in Shanghai to unite and supervise the government authorities and attending representatives to immediately reject this measure and not discuss it. If we want to implement a policy of non-resistance and only seek to reach a compromise with Japan, and sign without thinking, not only will our people not recognize this humiliating and power-losing treaty, but they will also take strict measures to deal with the government and seek self-salvation for our nation. The matter is urgent and the time is pressing. My patriotic compatriots, will they also know how to plan to save it? The members of the association are really looking forward to it. Shanghai Sichuan Association, Geng Yin,</p>

<p>Suzhou, 8th, special dispatch states that at 9:00 a.m. on the 8th, one Japanese aircraft circled twice very low over Fushan Yucheng Hupu. The people in the aircraft could be seen and went to Baimao. At 9:30 a.m., one Japanese aircraft scouted over Taicang City, Maojia City, and Yuewang City. At 9:45 a.m., one Japanese aircraft arrived at Kunfei and circled twice. I fired with a gun and escaped. It came again at 10:10 a.m., flew around once, and left. At 10:30 a.m., one Japanese aircraft came to Baimao New City, circled several times, and threw a bomb that landed in the fields of Xinqiao and did not explode. I repelled it with anti-aircraft guns. The enemy in Fuqiao Town retreated to Yanglinkou. When Taicang entered Fuqiao Shisan, the county government sent Wang Yue to be the director of the Fuqiao Public Security Bureau. More than a dozen enemy troops and traitors from Laixin Town quarreled and killed eight traitors after dividing the spoils. The rest were locked up. On the 8th, Suzhou captured seven people, including Li Feishang, the pseudo-commander of the Loyal Patriotic Army, and escorted them to the headquarters. There are nearly 10,000 enemy troops in Jiading City, stationed in various ancestral halls, schools, and bureaus. They fired guns and practiced targets in the streets and alleys, and the people were panicked. Prosperous places have been destroyed. Commander Mao and Brigade Commander Weng accompanied</p>

<p>The Japanese army in Shanghai has a large batch of military food. Yesterday, it entrusted a certain British ship in this port to load more than 1,000 tons to Hankou, which was used by the Marine Corps, etc. There was also a batch of ammunition and military supplies that were loaded onto the Yuanjiang Maru and sent to the various ships in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3 id="e13">American Personages' Declaration on Boycotting Japanese Goods <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Issued by the American Boycott Association</p>
<p>The American intellectual class, angered by the Japanese warlords, exhausted their soldiers and asked for arms, invaded China, trampled on non-warfare and the Nine-Power Pact, and destroyed world peace, so they jointly advocated boycotting Japanese goods and organized the American</p>
<p>Boycott Association, America Boycott Associatian, at 218 Madison Street, New York, hoping to promote the awakening of the Japanese warlords through private economic sanctions, in order to maintain peace and maintain justice. For a time, the people of the country responded to the news, advised each other, and did not buy Japanese goods. Although it has not been long since then, according to Washington news, it has had a significant impact on Japanese-American trade. Now, the American Boycott Association's Declaration on Boycotting Japanese Goods has been received and translated in order to show the enthusiasm of the people of that country in maintaining peace. The title is "Why not boycott those who disrupt peace? Boycott for peace." It states, "Gentlemen, even if you are an ordinary man or woman in the United States, you still have great power to stop the current war in China and curb the threat to our peace, so that it does not spread and become difficult to map, and there is a risk of regretting it. You don't have to wait for the slow and outdated international diplomatic machinery, or the government that pays attention to other issues and is concerned about future elections, to save this situation. You can immediately stand up and do it yourself today. If you can boycott Japanese goods sold in the United States today, you can immediately force Japan to stop the war and be willing to accept public judgment. According to Japan's foreign trade, 36% is in China and 40% is in the United States. Since China refused to buy Japanese goods, this 36% has actually been completely lost. If we also boycott Japanese goods, 76% of Japan's foreign trade will be temporarily suspended. The result can be imagined. Japan will inevitably succumb. The countries of the world have shown that they have lost 76% of their foreign trade and can continue to engage in hostile actions. Boycotting Japanese goods will not cause a US-Japan war, because Japan does not dare and cannot resist this kind of boycott. The Japanese economic community will not be able to last without collapsing. The Japanese are afraid of this kind of boycott and will inevitably accept it and come to peace, and may not dare to rashly engage in war. We must exercise this power today, but it is not out of anger, nor is it out of hatred, but out of great regret, because the situation has come to this point, and we have to force the Japanese warlords to know that in today's civilized world, they must not regard the treaties that stipulate the peaceful resolution of international disputes as mere written documents. We do not want to determine who is right and who is wrong between China and Japan in Manchuria, but we believe that Japan's use of force in Manchuria and Shanghai is a big mistake. Japan must submit its disputes to public judgment. If the Japanese feel that they are right, they should submit them frankly without any doubt. Japan must be taught a lesson so that it knows that the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Pact, and the League of Nations Charter are not ideal articles for those who aim high, but rather the solemn and common-sense determination of rational nations to see an orderly, safe, and not turbulent and terrifying future world, and therefore conclude these sacred treaties. If today's Japan is not stopped, the results of our thirteen years of efforts to achieve international order will be completely destroyed. Everything from the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Pact, the League of Nations Charter, and the Open Door Policy will be trampled on without leaving anything behind. If today's Japan's path is not blocked, security cannot be expected. Looking ahead, we only have the terrible war, using chemical drugs, poisonous gas, and sky bombings, to cause total destruction, and plunge the world into financial bankruptcy. Gentlemen, you, I, and the ordinary men and women of the United States all want to see a rational life with good order and good design in our future, but only by maintaining the Kellogg-Briand Pact and other peace treaties can we prove this kind of life. If peace cannot be maintained by following this path, please buy gas masks immediately and stop all plans. The situation is imminent and there is only today, no tomorrow. Therefore, we must immediately boycott Japanese goods today without delay. This is not a fleeting accidental event, but for the sake of peace treaties and for the sake of world order. If we lose the opportunity to make a plan, it will be too late. Furthermore, gentlemen, at this time, you can still appeal to the rational feelings of the Japanese people. If it is too late, it will be too late. If the Japanese warlords see that it is not difficult to play with the powers, they will eliminate all opposing elements in the country. The whole of Japan, under its command, will begin to follow the path of overcoming the world. Afterwards, Japan's military power, with the help of coal, iron, and oil resources from China and Manchuria, will become stronger and stronger. If there is another act of destroying peace and world order, no one will be able to withstand its attack. Now its military power is lacking basic economic power and cannot engage in a long-term war. This time, it is taking advantage of the troubled times in the world to show its ambitions. We can still call it a false alarm. If it is later, we cannot add these four words. If you want to see international order, protect our country from future aggression, and save the innocent lives of non-combatants, you should immediately catch up and boycott Japanese goods immediately. You must know that when you read this article, countless women and children are looking up at the bombing planes hovering overhead, wondering where the second batch of bombs will fall, and your crisis of peace is also increasing with time. The following is a list of Japan's main exports to the United States. Please refer to this list and make our strength visible today: "Raw silk, dried beans, crab meat, multicolored porcelain, silk fabrics, straw hats, lotus flowers, tulip flowers, narcissus bulbs, otter skins." When you buy the above-mentioned items, you must obtain reliable proof that they are not Japanese goods. For example, raw silk is the lifeblood of the Japanese economy, accounting for 90% of the total value of Japanese goods exported to the United States. However, Japanese silk also accounts for 90% of the raw silk used in the United States. Therefore, when buying silk fabrics, it is extremely difficult to determine whether it contains silk or not, but if it can be effectively boycotted, Japanese silk will definitely be hit hard. If you cannot clearly prove that the silk fabrics you buy are from China, France, Vietnam, or other non-Japanese silk, it is better not to buy them and choose cotton, wool, or artificial silk fabrics instead. If there are other commonly used Japanese goods among you, please check them yourself, especially the goods sold in the uniform stores of five cents and ten cents. You must check whether there are words such as made in Japan. Our country's laws stipulate that foreign goods must indicate the name of the country of manufacture, so it is very easy to know whether it is Japanese goods. When you go to the stores you usually trade with, please tell the owner, manager, and salesperson the reasons mentioned in this article and the determination not to buy Japanese goods again, and advise them not to approve Japanese goods again. In addition, please do not take Japanese ships or transport goods on Japanese ships. I hope that you will use your personal judgment to make the boycott of Japanese goods have a great effect and please implement it immediately. There is no end to the expectations. Sincerely, the American Boycott Association.</p>

<p>Opposing the Conclusion of a Treaty that Loses Rights and Humiliates the Country. The Whampoa Alumni Save the Country Corps sent a telegram saying, "To all newspapers and compatriots across the country, the Japanese disaster is unspeakable for our country. At this ceasefire conference, the Japanese side actually proposed a peace agreement prohibiting all anti-Japanese movements and accepting the Manchurian-Mongolian secret agreement, and designated Zhabei as a neutral zone, demanding to station troops in four important military areas: Wusong, Zhabei, Yinxiang, and Jiangwan, and not determining the withdrawal period. There is no sincerity for peace, which is clear as a mirror. It is reported that our side has completely conceded to this request. If this is true, it is obviously obliterating public opinion and willingly selling the country. If a treaty that loses rights and humiliates the country is concluded, the people of the country will never recognize it. This group vows to oppose it to the death. The telegram is sad and indignant, and extremely urgent. The executive members of the Whampoa Alumni Anti-Japanese Save the Country Corps, He Jingmin, Zhu Yecang, Xu Ruiheng, Li Tianzhao, Tian Zibin, and all 400 members, bow."</p>
<h3 id="e15">Recent Situation of the National Wounded Soldiers Hospital <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The National Wounded Soldiers Hospital, located at Jiaotong University on Haig Road, has been established for more than a month. Recently, it was reported that most of the wounded soldiers have recovered, and the hospital is located in the Chinese community. If the peace talks break down, the traffic may be hindered. Therefore, there is a saying that it will be temporarily closed in the middle of this month in advance. The reporter took a car to visit the hospital the day before yesterday, and recorded what he heard and saw as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Organization Overview <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The internal organization of the hospital is presided over by the Board of Directors, which is in charge of the overall planning of the hospital. Under the Board of Directors, there are four groups: the Dean, the Vice Dean, the Medical Affairs, the Administrative Health, and the Service. Doctors and nurses are in charge of the Beijing Union Hospital and the Hong Kong St. John Ambulance Brigade, as well as doctors and nurses from Shanghai who are enthusiastic about saving the wounded. There are more than ten doctors and about eighty nurses in the hospital, and about fifty staff members, for a total of more than one hundred and fifty people. All of them are not paid, and the round-trip travel expenses are also self-prepared. Some staff members work full-time, while others work part-time, because everyone has to take care of their original occupations in addition to the hospital affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Injury Statistics <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The hospital was originally equipped to accommodate 500 wounded soldiers. However, due to the retreat of our army and its isolation from the front lines, it only accommodated over 270 people. The statistics for the injured parts are as follows: left hand 22%, head 15%, left stomach 8%, right hand 8%, left leg 7%, right leg 7%, chest 6%, right arm 6%, right leg 5%, left foot 5%, shoulder 4%, back 3%, other 4%.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Wounded Soldiers' Life <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The youngest is 16 years old, the oldest is 53 years old, with an average age of about 22. Most are from Hunan province, followed by Guangdong, then Zhejiang and Jiangsu, totaling 16 provinces. In terms of military unit, the 61st Division has the most, followed by the 88th Division, 87th Division, 60th Division, and 78th Division. In the hospital, apart from the seriously injured who are bedridden all day, the slightly injured mostly stroll in the hospital's lawn. Jiaotong University is naturally beautiful with flowers and trees. When the weather is fine, the hospital specially plays music on a phonograph for the wounded soldiers to enjoy in the sunlight. Every Saturday afternoon, a concert is held in the school's gymnasium for the entertainment of the wounded soldiers. All wounded soldiers' hospitals have difficulties in providing food. This hospital specially elected four representatives from the wounded soldiers to serve as kitchen committee members, jointly responsible for managing meals with the staff.</p>
<h3 id="e19">A Letter of Thanks <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The hospital's entire organization and equipment were set up hastily, so it is difficult to be perfect. However, in terms of spirit, there is certainly much to be admired. Members of the Hong Kong St. John Ambulance Brigade are mostly children of overseas Chinese merchants in Hong Kong who voluntarily returned to the country to share the national crisis. When they came, the Hong Kong government did not allow them to leave the country. After several negotiations, they obtained a special permission from the King of England before they could make the trip. The Peking Union Medical College's rescue team was also voluntarily organized by the hospital's Chinese doctors to come to the battlefield to rescue wounded soldiers. One from the south and one from the north, it is a rare coincidence. They all take great care of the wounded soldiers. Recently, the hospital discharged wounded soldiers who publicly issued a letter of thanks, which is recorded as follows. This shows the wounded soldiers' feelings about the hospital. The original letter is as follows: To all Boy Scouts, nurses, medical officers, and doctors, greetings. We have been here at the School of Law and Politics for four weeks. You have treated us with respect and love like compatriots, day and night. Now our injuries have fully recovered, and we are about to be discharged from the hospital. You have also given us clothes and money. We are truly ashamed that we have nothing to repay you with. When we return to our troops, we will promote your kindness and love to our superiors and brothers. As the saying goes, "People leave their names behind, and geese leave their calls behind." Everyone admires you, and everyone respects you. We cannot express ourselves enough. We respectfully ask about your well-being. Huang Baozhong, Zhao Pinzhi, Feng Desheng, Bowing, Room 111.</p>

<p>The citizens of the various Chinese-leased areas in the city have seen a significant reduction in their economic capacity due to the violent Japanese invasion and the strike to resist the enemy. They have organized a rent reduction committee to request landlords to reduce or exempt rent in order to ease the burden on citizens, and have petitioned the municipal authorities for assistance. However, only the Yeguang Company has voluntarily waived two months' rent. Yesterday, it was heard that the property department of the Pacific Trading Company in this city has also voluntarily exempted two or three months' rent. The announcement is recorded below: This is to inform you that the owner of the houses in this area, considering the impact of the war on your tenants, has specially exempted two months' rent for February and March of this year. However, this right is only granted to those who do not owe rent. If all tenants can pay off their accumulated rent in full within this month, they can also enjoy this right. Otherwise, the two months' rent will still be collected. This is hereby announced.</p>

<p>A label was mistakenly attached and hidden in the baggage compartment. The President of the travel agency, Tan, narrated the incident.</p>
<p>During the League of Nations Investigation Commission's trip to Hankou, it was rumored that Sir Lytton's white iron box was lost on the journey. As this matter was of great importance, the reporter visited the China Travel Service. According to President Chen Xiangtao, Sir Lytton's white iron box was not lost. The luggage of the League of Nations Investigation Commission, from Shanghai to Hankou and then from Hankou to Pukou, was carefully taken care of along the way by specialists assigned by our company. There were hundreds of pieces of luggage, and the procedures were very complicated. When the Investigation Commission went to Hankou, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handled the luggage in two categories. Items to be used on the ship to Hankou were affixed with brown labels for placement in the cabin, while items not to be used were affixed with green labels and placed in the baggage compartment. Our company's personnel handled them separately according to these labels. Later, when the ship was about to depart, Sir Lytton suddenly remembered the white iron box and searched everywhere for it but could not find it. Then, our company's personnel found it among hundreds of pieces of luggage in the baggage compartment. It was clearly labeled with a green label.</p>
<p>It turned out that Sir Lytton's aides had accidentally made a mistake when labeling the white iron box. This is the true story of what happened at that time.</p>

Therefore, he has not been taking much medicine recently and only eats a small amount of easily digestible food each day, fearing that it will harm his stomach. The sections on recovery reported in the Shanghai newspapers a few days ago are not true.</p>

According to the Public Works Department, the bungalow southeast of the girls' school on the site needs to be moved to the southwest. The principal of the school suggested rebuilding a three-story building for cooking and art rooms. The acting director of the Education Department stated that there was no such provision in the budget. The Director of the Public Works Department stated that the original plan did not include bedrooms. Everyone believed that there was no need to set up bedrooms in a commuter school and that the principal should be notified to change it to another use. Also, for the construction of the boys' school, the buildings attached to the girls' school should be demolished. The subsidies for foreign schools were determined as follows: 60,000 taels for the Japanese school, 3,000 taels for the German school, 2,500 taels for the Jewish school, 1,500 taels for the First Russian school, and 500 taels for Ms. Dealpen's school. Regarding the exemption from donations and taxes, the chairman stated that from 1933 onwards, the subsidies should include exemption from taxes and donations. In the future, the amount of subsidies may not be as large as it is now in order to take care of other foreign schools. As for the subsidies for Chinese schools, the chairman stated that he hoped to reach an agreement with the Chinese authorities as soon as possible. A committee member reported that he had had informal contact with the Municipal Education Bureau and that a more definite report may be available at the next meeting. The Director of the Education Department also reported on the reopening of the schools.

<h3 id="e32">The Story of Mrs. Zhang Jingsheng's Suicide <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jingsheng has strange habits and lives in a house built in the field. His wife still guards the empty boudoir alone. The two sides have repeatedly clashed. A letter from Shantou on March 31 states: Among the young men and women of modern China, who does not know Dr. Zhang Jingsheng? His life deeds, those who pay attention to reading newspapers, can mostly tell. His wife, Ms. Xu Chunjing, unfortunately committed suicide in her hometown of Fushan, Raoping, this month on the 17th.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Taking Heartbreak Grass to Kill Herself <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The reason for her death, according to the Shantou newspaper, was "stimulated by a kind of love that is more separated than together," that is, the result of unrequited love and the inability to satisfy sexual desire. Many people doubt this record, because it is contrary to the beauty and sex that Dr. Zhang has studied hard all his life, and it is far from the truth. Because of Xu's tragic death, the people of Raoping,</p>
<h3 id="e34">Developed a Kind of Ballad <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Saying, "A scholar wears a gauze hat, Focusing on managing the country and not caring for the family, It is better to marry a farmer, Who farms in the day and returns home at night." This was made to commemorate Xu. When Zhang and Xu got married twenty years ago, their love was very deep. Zhang studied at Tongwen Middle School in Shantou and was extremely intelligent. He was ranked as the champion when he graduated. The villagers called him Xiucai Zhang. Later, he went to France to study at the University of Lyon, worked hard to study, and obtained a doctorate in philosophy. Ten years ago, he returned to his hometown in glory. The county magistrate and village elders specially protected and welcomed him. Many people</p>
<h3 id="e35">Called Him Zhuangyuan Lang <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Because Zhang was too Europeanized, his dealings with the world could not fit in with the customs. In Chao'an Changjin Middle School for half a year, student tides rose one after another, and he was attacked by public opinion. Zhang resigned and went north to serve as a professor at Peking University for several years. He married Ms. Chu Songxue, Xu Chunjing did not hear about it. Zhang also proposed a divorce, Xu endured it, hoping that Zhang would change his mind and be a first-class lady. She also carried her books to a female school in Chao'an, just to improve her studies,</p>
<h3 id="e36">Can Please Zhang <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>At that time, Zhang and Chu were very happy in Ping and forgot about the hardship in the room. Later, Chu had other ambitions and separated from Zhang. The Beauty Bookstore opened by Zhang was sealed in Shanghai and was expelled after going to Hangzhou. Those who had friendship with Zhang mostly regretted it. Zhang gave the son born by Chu to Xu Chunjing to raise. Xu could not give birth to a son with Zhang due to less gathering and more separation, and regarded Chu's son as her own. Chu's son also called her Niang. Last year,</p>
<h3 id="e37">Zhang Returned to His Hometown from Paris <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>He was quite short of travel expenses, which were raised by various friends. Zhang was extremely frugal when he passed through Shantou. When friends visited, they asked when the second volume of his new book "Sex History" would be published. Zhang refused to talk about it and said that he went to France to study the social foundation of autonomy and rural areas, and made on-site explorations. After returning home, he trained his seven-year-old son to live as a tree artist. Xu saw that her husband's habits had changed greatly, and she also tried to please him, hoping that people and the moon would last forever and always sing together. According to outsiders' speculation, marrying a husband as a sex doctor, between the beds, of course,</p>
<h3 id="e38">There is unspeakable happiness <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Everything is perfect, but Zhang is not used to living at home, and spends more than a thousand yuan to build another wooden house in the field, covered with reeds, and surrounded by iron gauze nets, without using glass. Zhang told people that it can make the air flow smoothly. People call it a strange doctor. Xu Chunjing still guards the empty boudoir alone, with cold pillows and blankets, spending her lonely life. One day Xu</p>
<h3 id="e39">Quietly went to the field <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Opened the door of his thatched cottage, Zhang scolded, you country woman, you really don't understand hygiene, opening the door once, followed in many microorganisms, if you come in twice a day, after a month, my room will become a mountain of insects, where will I live, if you want to come to me in the future, please knock on the door outdoors first, let me come out to talk, Xu blushed and retreated in depression, this is</p>
<h3 id="e40">The Main Reason for Suicide <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Zhang lives in the thatched cottage every day, very regularly, in addition to chairs, tables and canvas beds, books are piled up on the ground</p>
<p>On the board, like a hill, get up at five o'clock in the morning to take a bath, in the creek</p>
<p>Although the wind and cold are piercing, there is no gap, sometimes washing two or three times a day, farmers call it copper skin and steel bones, after bathing, do deep breathing and exercise seven o'clock breakfast eat green vegetables, eggs, milk, beef, noodles (machine-made dry), tofu, fresh fish, soybeans, green beans, put a pound scale on the dining table, when eating, the plate</p>

<p>Exactly two pounds, two pounds and four taels at noon, one pound and eight taels in the evening, analyze the quality contained in the food, such as a doctor dispensing medicine, opening a dish is similar to a prescription, one day his wife washed the vegetables unqualified (careless), Zhang saw it and angrily said, you are so unhygienic, washing less than three times, you want to kill me, Xu was ashamed, Zhang gave a big lecture on hygiene subjects in the kitchen, saying how to put bowls and chopsticks, how to fear dust, there are insect eggs parasitizing in green vegetables, when washing, you must carefully wash each leaf and root, and then use boiling water to wash it, Xu was</p>
<h3 id="e42">Angered to Tears <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>This is another reason for Chunjing's suicide, Zhang Breakfast After eight thirty, I started translating and writing, and in the afternoon, I read and copied, rarely laughed, when he was working, he did not answer all relatives and friends, even if there were letters sent from afar, he must wait for leisure to open and read, after the work was completed, or with his seven-year-old son, hoe to</p>

<p>Dig up soil, test the soil quality, and note what kind of plants are suitable for planting in a certain place, and arrange them in piles, like the five hundred Arhats of Lingyin Temple, or patrol the villages and alleys, see that the drains are not clear, the garbage is not removed, that is, order the nearby people to pick it up, the villagers call it "Zhuangyuan tour Jin Street", Zhang's life dare not be violated a little, sometimes go into the neighbor's kitchen, supervise the neighbor to repair and wash the whole sweep, Zhang is sometimes scolded by people, also do not care, after all, the heart of awe still exists, Zhang sometimes sees women</p>

In the recent forty days, bandits have risen in various places, and the steamer that has been robbed has been robbed more than twenty times. A batch of wealthy gentry in Wuxi recently carried a huge amount of property and took an armed steamer to Shanghai. They were also robbed by bandits on the way, losing property worth 300,000 yuan.

<p>Wuxi wealthy households Sun Zhenqiu, celebrity Yang Bangfan, and Sun Duosen's son-in-law, Mr. Jia, and Wu Guanli, etc., were afraid that the armistice would break down and the Japanese planes would wreak havoc. They discussed moving valuables such as precious property and current costumes to Shanghai, and planned to deposit them in the vault of China Fortune Bank, and send the families of each person to live in the concession. Also, considering that in the past few days, seven inland river steamers have been robbed, everyone discussed at that time to find a safe way. At that time, there was a transport steamer from a factory that returned to Shanghai from Jiangyin. Yang Bangfan once served as the director of the Shanghai Arsenal and was quite familiar with it. He negotiated with the round to carry the belongings and families of each person to Shanghai. After agreeing, they disembarked in Wuxi,</p>
<h3 id="e48">Armed Protection to Shanghai <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>

Yang, Sun, Jia, Wu, etc., boarded the boat, and also thought it was reliable and worry-free, that is, escorted the boxes and properties to open Shanghai. The security was very strict along the way. However, when the boat arrived near the Dianhe River, it suddenly saw many sampan-style boats in front of it. When the round approached, bandits fired shots to stop it. There were more than one hundred bandits present, each holding a box cannon rifle, surrounded the steamer, and many bandits jumped into the round to rob.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Lawsuit Regarding a Russian Yacht <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>A Russian named Ke Lashafu owned a yacht named Si Fantelina, which was stolen in Vladivostok in October of last year and disappeared without a trace. This year, a friend of Ni discovered the yacht in Shanghai's Huangpu River. The yacht had been renamed Piqisini. He entrusted lawyer Bo Laituofu Yan'esen to request the new owner, Fu Laqiusi, to return the yacht to the Shanghai First Special District Court. Yesterday, civil court president Li Chi conducted the trial. The defendant argued that he had bought it from two Russians and lawyer Zhang Jiahui proved that it was in complete good faith and had no intention of buying stolen goods. When questioned, the original licenses of the three Russians were found to not have been issued by the Vladivostok Customs. Although the Shanghai Russian Seamen's Association translated it into English, the secretary of the association, Bao Luoting, testified in court that he could only prove that the English translation was his, and could not prove that the yacht's license was legitimately obtained. Subsequently, Lawyer E stated that the plaintiff's yacht theft was certified by the Vladivostok Customs, the Diplomatic Office, and the Chinese Consulate, and the facts were clear and indisputable. Moreover, the yacht was completely consistent in dimensions, depth, weight, shape and color, with the subject matter of the case, with photographs as proof. Since the defendant bought it from three Russians, the original license of the three Russians should be examined for defects. According to the registration principle of ships, if the three Russians had registered with the Vladivostok Customs, then a certificate from the Customs should be used. The license presented by the defendant does not have a certificate from the Customs, and even the witness Bao Luoting presented by the defendant cannot recognize the seal on the license, so it is undoubtedly forged. In other words, since the original license has flaws, the defendant's acquisition is also illegal. According to Article 949 of the Civil Code on Property Rights, the defendant should return the yacht to the plaintiff. The defendant's lawyer argued that the defendant's possession was in good faith, and if he wanted to return it, he should be compensated for the amount paid by the defendant. Lawyer E immediately argued that the defendant's proof of good faith only exempts him from criminal liability, and is only not purchasing stolen goods, and cannot be exempted from his civil liability because of good faith. The return of the price must be determined based on whether it meets the conditions of Article 950. Since the defendant did not purchase it from an auction or a public market, and the three Russians are not ship merchants, then the return of the price has no legal basis and a judgment should be made according to the plaintiff's request. The defendant's witness also raised the issue of the power of Red Russia and White Russia, but in fact, this case is purely a simple theft case and has nothing to do with politics. Lawyer E also responded to this. The case was judged yesterday. The main text was that the defendant should deliver the yacht to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff should pay 1,300 yuan to the defendant, etc.</p>

<p>Relief Association Runs Isolation Hospital  The Temporary Relief Association for Refugees in the War Zone of this city has established more than 30 boarding houses to provide relief to the war-stricken compatriots. Three temporary temples were used as places for accommodation and treatment. In recent times, refugees fleeing Shanghai from the interior have continued to arrive in a steady stream. Accommodation has become increasingly difficult and the lodging places are overcrowded. In addition to finding ways to add lodging places at any time, due to the unfavorable weather and the prevalence of seasonal diseases, there are many refugees in the lodging places belonging to the association, and it is inevitable that some will suffer from seasonal diseases. In order to take care of the lives of the refugees, the association has found a large Western-style house at 476 Haige Road, which has been opened as an isolation hospital, to ensure hygiene and prevent infection.</p>

<p>Widespread Condolences  The Newspaper Industry Union issued a message stating that the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao authorities had, on this occasion, groundlessly expelled workers, blockaded the workplace, and illegally detained workers, causing labor-management disputes. Although powerful figures had been appointed to mediate, the management showed no sincerity, almost causing a breakdown. Details had already been reported in the newspapers. Various groups in Shanghai, fearing that both parties would take extreme measures, continued to make great efforts to mediate and sent personnel to express their condolences to the workers of the newspaper. The situation yesterday is summarized below.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Mediate  The Shanghai Postal Workers Union, upon hearing that mediation between the two sides had failed, sent representatives Yu Songqiao and Cheng Zuoqing to express their condolences yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. They expressed their indignation at the improper actions taken by the newspaper management on this occasion and were reportedly preparing to send representatives to mediate with the management. If the management again showed no sincerity in resolving the matter, they would resolutely provide support with their strength.</p>
<p>Union's Attitude  The person in charge of the Newspaper Industry Union told reporters that the means of destruction employed by the capitalists were endless. For example, the advertisement recently published to register all workers, after careful study by the union, proves several points. 1. Why register old workers? 2. Various regulations and labor-management contracts have been signed, so why fill out a letter of willingness? 3. The cause of this incident was only the issue of printing the Da Wanbao newspaper, which had nothing to do with the newspaper itself. 4. No new demands were made in advance, and there were no illegal actions, so there was no such thing as willful arbitrariness and peace of mind. All of this proves that the capitalists deliberately destroyed the workers' organization, so the union is determined to do its best to deal with it.</p>
<p>Sending Condolences 1. Publishing Industry Industrial Union Organizing Committee (omitted above) All workers of the Shishi Xinbao under your association have recently been brutally destroyed by the management, relying on external forces. The news has caused deep indignation. The history of labor movement in your newspaper is glorious. This time, the leadership has oppressed the workers and engaged in struggle. The success of the great achievements can be predicted. Our association respectfully sends a brief letter and sends representatives Ge Hecai, Feng Jifang, etc. to express their condolences. We hope to make greater efforts to win the final victory. (omitted below) 2. First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, omitted above. On this occasion, the Shishi Xinbao management forced the workers of the museum to print the Da Wanbao newspaper, using various threatening means to destroy the labor movement, and using the amulet of imperialists to detain loyal workers, and even insult the members of your association, which is contrary to reason and illegal, which is extremely infuriating. In addition to being willing to be the backing of your association, we will send another special letter of condolence. (omitted below) 3. China Journalism Research Association. This time, your association was brutally suppressed by the capitalists, blockaded the workplace, and expelled workers because it refused to print the Da Wanbao, a trust newspaper industry. When our colleagues heard the news, they were all filled with righteous indignation. They unanimously decided to send comrades Chen Weizhong and Ye Qing to represent our association to express their condolences and hope that your association will fight with the capitalists and persist to the end. Our association will naturally be the backing of your association. (omitted below)</p>
<p>Letter to the Lawyers Association  In addition, because the newspaper's employee Jiang Jiemin used a self-defense pistol to illegally arrest workers, violating the police law, the union sent a letter to the Lawyers Association, requesting the association to impose appropriate sanctions. The original letter is as follows: Sir, Jiang Jiemin, a member of your association, used a self-defense pistol at the intersection of Damalu Jiangxi Road at 2 AM on the 5th of this month to illegally arrest Ma Deren, Wu Miaosheng, Hu Wan, Shen Gengsheng, Zhang Wenquan, Chen Shixiang, Zhu Zuxing, and Wang Kegang, eight workers from our association. This is extremely wrong. Your association has always been committed to upholding justice and protecting human rights. Jiang Jiemin's illegal actions should be immediately expelled from membership as a warning to others and to protect the reputation of your association.</p>

<p>Wang Jingwei Reports on Disaster Relief, Resistance to Aggression, and Pacification 丨 Zhangjia Said Buddhism Can Help Sincere Unity (Beiping) Luoyang Telegram, The Congress on the morning of the 8th was chaired by Wang Xiaolai. Wang Jingwei reported on resistance to aggression, disaster relief, and pacification, saying that resistance to aggression and pacification were closely related, and that disaster relief was also closely related. All three must be on the right political track to have good results. The Kuomintang has taken practical political responsibility for only three years. Although there have been many disputes in the party, they are all due to disagreements on political views, not competition for power and profit. Now that unification has been achieved, we are striving to shorten the period of political tutelage. Subsequently, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on diplomacy, followed by a speech by Zhangjia Living Buddha, saying that the national crisis is imminent, and the five ethnic groups should unite. The power of Buddhism can make sincere unity and does not conflict with the Three Principles of the People. The Congress will continue at 2 PM in the afternoon. (Eighth Daily Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Wang Jingwei's Opening Speech <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Luoyang) President Wang gave an opening speech at the opening ceremony of the National Disaster Conference on the 7th, saying that the holding of this National Disaster Conference was decided by the Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, and later decided by the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee. The National Disaster Conference should discuss matters related to resistance to aggression, disaster relief, and pacification. The National Government issued an order in January this year and decided to hold the meeting in Nanjing on February 1, but unfortunately, the Shanghai Incident occurred. The National Government moved to Luoyang on January 30, so the meeting could not be held as scheduled. Only today can the meeting be opened in Luoyang. This meeting is a manifestation of the consistent national consciousness of the Chinese nation. This national consciousness is the crystallization of more than 4,000 years of China, and is the only lifeline that supports the country for more than 4,000 years. Our national consciousness not only has national characteristics, but also has global characteristics. Internally, we seek the freedom and equality of ethnic groups within the country, and externally, we seek the freedom and equality of the entire Chinese nation in the world. Unfortunately, in our efforts to seek freedom and equality, Japan has continued to attack us. Conspiring to split my north and south in the Xin Hai year was the first step. The request for the 21 articles in the fourth year of the Republic of China was the second step. The Jinan Massacre in the seventeenth year was a plot to destroy my unification as the third step. Now it is making a fourth step attack, which is more serious than before. If we want to break through this difficult situation, we must promote national consciousness and strengthen unity and struggle. The most important task during the period of political tutelage is to awaken the masses, especially the productive masses. The so-called production includes spiritual production and material production. At present, the most important thing is that all spiritual and material producers work together. You are the most outstanding members of all producers. Now you are all in the National Disaster Conference, jointly seeking ways to solve the national crisis, and I believe that there will be great success in the future. In addition to paying tribute to you today, I have two more points to make. One is the issue of responsibility. The National Party Comrades fully bear the responsibility for the national crisis and cannot shirk it. We are very willing to accept everyone's assistance in holding this meeting today, but we never intend to shirk responsibility. The second is the issue of authority. The Executive Yuan prepared the National Disaster Conference in accordance with the order of the National Government, and the order of the National Government was based on the resolution of the Central Party. The National Disaster Conference discusses matters related to resistance to aggression, disaster relief, and pacification. Therefore, the Executive Yuan is of course responsible for answering questions within this scope. The Executive Yuan cannot answer questions outside this scope, but everyone can freely express their opinions. As for various issues related to military affairs, finance, diplomacy, and resistance to aggression, disaster relief, and pacification, the various departments of the Executive Yuan have already prepared to report to you.

<h3 id="e74">Speech by Member Tao Menghe <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>(Luoyang) At the opening ceremony of the National Crisis Conference, member representative Tao Menghe delivered a speech, roughly stating: 1. Regarding the location for holding this National Crisis Conference, some advocated for Nanjing, but after I arrived in the temporary capital, I felt that holding it in Luoyang was even better than Nanjing. This is because the recent history of the Republic of China has all taken place in areas with convenient transportation, and everyone lacks a deep understanding of the central interior. Now, being able to hold the National Crisis Conference in Luoyang will naturally allow for a deeper understanding of China's national conditions and the dangerous situation of the national crisis. 2. In the past one or two decades, we have not worked hard to carry out the national independence movement, quell internal strife, and ensure the solid and complete organization of the country. When the Kuomintang was in power, it could have earnestly implemented Mr. Sun Yat-sen's policies, but unfortunately, in reality, things did not go as desired, and our people did not unanimously urge the government to promote and expand national consciousness, making the country a very powerful entity that could stand in the turbulent Pacific situation. This responsibility should be borne jointly by all the people, but the Kuomintang should also bear considerable responsibility. Those participating in this meeting are willing to do their best to demonstrate that our national spirit and organization are extremely cohesive and powerful, and are even more willing to unanimously support the current government in implementing the resolutions of the conference to achieve the goal of resisting aggression. 3. If the people can strive to thoroughly implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, then the Republic of China can undoubtedly become one of the most powerful countries along the Pacific coast. Before the Kuomintang's period of political tutelage is completed, how to begin to truly implement all of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings is a fundamental question. As for whether the three major issues of resisting aggression, disaster relief, and pacification discussed in the conference can be implemented depends entirely on the power, policies, and methods of the current government authorities. We cannot but say that in the past few years, the realization of Sun Yat-sen's doctrine has not yet been achieved, but we still believe in the future of the Kuomintang. This belief is the hope that it can truly and thoroughly implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings in the future. We come to this meeting from this standpoint, and we hope that the chairman can convey the contributions of the members' discussions to the government, and even more hope that the government authorities can adopt or refer to them as much as possible.

Zhang Honglie, the director of the Construction Department, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of Han, and Lytton gave a speech of thanks. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 5:20 PM today, the investigation team and welcomers toured Daming Lake in twenty-four boats. The entire lake was under martial law, and the lakefront was packed with onlookers. They first arrived at the ancient Lixia Pavilion. The team expressed great respect upon seeing a portrait of Confucius. Then, they went to the library and greatly admired the Song and Yuan books and ancient zithers, saying that sculpture and music were both introduced to the West from China. Gu Weijun led the team to visit the traces of Japanese artillery shells from the May 3rd Incident. Lytton was quite surprised. Gu told reporters that the Northeast opposed his visit, but there was no formal statement. He would, of course, go. The Northeast's unwillingness for him to go was within expectations. Then, they boarded the boats again and went to the North Pole Pavilion, then changed to cars to tour the city's main roads, returning to the station at 7:05 PM. All sectors of society bid farewell at the station as scheduled, with military music playing as the train departed northward at 7:10 PM. Lytton nodded and returned the greeting from inside the train until the train left the platform. On this day, Zhang Shaotang, the secretary-general of the provincial government, waited for the team at the provincial government on behalf of Han. Gu Weijun introduced them. Zhang Xueliang sent an armored car and Commander Tao with a company of martial arts troops to greet them in Dezhou. Han sent the "Beiping" armored car to Dezhou. Today, flags were hung throughout the city, and the streets were cleared. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The investigation team's special train has arrived in Yucheng. Reporters from Jinan newspapers visited the investigation team and Representative Gu, and were received by Zhang Xianglin for talks. On the 7th, Foreign Minister Luo answered Chairman Lytton's question in Nanjing, saying that the Foreign Ministry had not received any official documents from Tokyo stating that the "Manchukuo" opposed Chinese representatives accompanying the investigation team. He also asked about the investigation team's attitude. Lytton replied that the team must have Chinese representatives participate and, based on the League of Nations resolution, would adhere to clear facts and impartial judgment. Opposing the Chinese representatives was no different from opposing the investigation team. As for the situation and organization that occurred in the Eastern Provinces in recent months, the investigation team could certainly not recognize them. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) A telegram from Lincheng stated that Chairman Han had sent Senators Dai Yanqiu and Wei Qingping, with a team of fifty armed guards, on an armored train to Xu to welcome and protect the investigation team back here, boarding the train to take over defense duties. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The local press in this city has prepared questions for the investigation team: 1. Opinions on the Shanghai Truce Conference. 2. What is their understanding of China after investigating the Shanghai war zone? 3. What are their related thoughts on the May 3rd Incident today? There is also a written statement to the team, with key points: 1. The Twenty-One Demands, the May 3rd Massacre, and the recent dispatch of troops to the Northeast and Shanghai are all part of Japan's traditional and consistent policy of aggression against China, which the team should have a fundamental understanding of in this Sino-Japanese dispute. 2. The resistance of the Chinese army and volunteers against Japan, and the people's spontaneous economic boycott of Japan, are all the result of Japan's actions, not the cause of Japan's dispatch of troops and implementation of tyranny. It is hoped that this principle will be reported to the League of Nations. 3. The Northeast rebels are all manipulated by the Japanese, who want to replay the old drama of the subjugation of Korea. 4. China sincerely wishes to work with the League of Nations for world peace, but Japan is trampling on the League of Nations Covenant. 5. The people of Shandong have suffered from the May 3rd artillery fire, and after the incidents in the Northeast and Shanghai, they still have to protect Japanese expatriates, which is even more painful. In short, it is hoped that the team will complete its peace mission with an impartial attitude and that the investigation will be successful, so that world peace and prosperity can be maintained.

<p>(Bengbu) The investigation team's special train arrived in Bengbu at 10:05 PM on the 7th. More than a hundred representatives from all walks of life welcomed them at the station. Gu Weijun accompanied Lytton and five others off the train to meet eight visitors. Lytton held name cards and shook hands with them one by one, saying that the investigation team had arrived here and was undeserving of everyone's welcome. Thank you. Ma Jingchang gave a simple speech, reporting on Japan's violent aggression against China and asking for justice to be upheld and peace maintained. Lytton nodded, indicating acceptance. Then, he walked over and met with the welcomers. At ten o'clock, Lytton and the others boarded the train and departed northward. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Passed Through Xuzhou Late at Night Without Being Welcomed <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The League of Nations investigation team's special train left Pukou at 4:00 PM on the 7th and passed through Bengbu at 10:00 PM, arriving in Xuzhou at 3:30 AM on the 8th. A welcome slogan in Chinese, English, and French was made on the overpass of the Xuzhou station, and the electric lights shone extremely brightly. Representatives from all walks of life had already arrived at the station earlier to greet them and had prepared a welcome speech, pushing Feng Jieren to deliver the speech in English. Later, Qian Zongyuan, the director of the Jinpu Railway's on-train reception, sent a telegram from Bengbu, stating that he had received instructions from Representative Gu that the special train arrived in Xuzhou in the middle of the night, and all the representatives were already asleep, so he requested that all greetings be waived. Therefore, they temporarily dispersed. When the train arrived at the station, personnel from the Jinpu and Longhai Railways took care of it at the station, and the order was extremely quiet. At 4:30 AM, the train departed northward, scheduled to arrive in Jinan at 4:00 PM for an inspection of the traces of the May 3rd Massacre, and scheduled to arrive in Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 9th. The train consisted of a total of eighteen cars, towed by locomotive number 287, which was replaced by locomotive number 279 in Xuzhou to tow it north. Between Pukou-Xuzhou and Xuzhou-Dezhou, the 3rd and 1st Railway Artillery Teams followed the train, with armored cars in the front and rear, providing extremely thorough security. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Qian Zongyuan told reporters that the investigation team's representatives felt very comfortable on the train here, saying that it exceeded their ideal vehicle. The representatives held a meeting on the Longhe ship on the morning of the 7th before boarding the train to discuss Representative Gu's visit to the Northeast. The representatives believed that they were commissioned by the League of Nations to conduct an open investigation and treat both China and Japan with an equal spirit, without allowing any discrimination. Since the Japanese representatives had already participated, the Chinese representatives should also go. They unanimously agreed to Gu's visit to the Northeast. When passing through Chuzhou and Bengbu, representatives from all walks of life were granted an audience, and were received by the German representative. The Japanese representative Yoshida always accompanied him, so the representatives had little to say to the welcoming representatives, responding with a smile. As for his own mission, he was fully responsible for the reception on the Jinpu line, he said. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) When the League of Nations investigation team passed through Xuzhou, a certain foreigner spoke to reporters at the station in a private capacity, saying that Japan's refusal of Representative Gu to go to the Northeast was completely unreasonable. Gu was invited by the investigation team, and refusing Gu was tantamount to opposing the investigation team, and also tantamount to opposing the League of Nations. Within the scope of the Chinese military, Japanese representatives can participate, and within the scope of the Japanese military, Chinese representatives can of course participate. As for the refusal to allow the Chinese side's prepared train to pass through the border, it is even more unconscious. The same vehicle is travelling the same route, why not be responsible for its protection? Moreover, the Northeast is still Chinese territory, but it is temporarily occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese action only exposes their weakness and provides grounds for the world to criticize them. Looking at America's boycott of Japanese goods, the Japanese dare not say a word, showing that the means of coercion are applied selectively. Having lived in China for a long time, I sincerely hope that the Chinese people can strive to strengthen themselves and avenge this humiliation, he said. (8th Dispatch)</p>

Late tonight, Harbin received a report of a major victory by the old Jilin army, saying that the old Jilin army had recovered all stations along the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway from Hailin to Shitouzhezi.

<p>British and French Differ with German and Italian Views, Conference Reaches Stalemate. Germany Opposes Preferential Tax Rates. Bulgaria Demands Membership. Representatives Employ Political Maneuvering, Unable to Shake Off Centuries of Bad Habits.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 7th: It is heard that the Four-Power Conference of England, France, Italy, and Germany will adjourn tomorrow and will probably reconvene in Geneva, as representatives from various countries will gather in Geneva next week to attend the disarmament conference. The committee studying the Danube River economic problems met all day, dispersing only at 5 PM. According to reliable sources, although the committee tried hard to find a solution to the problem, it ultimately failed to make real progress in reconciling the differences between England and France with Italy and Germany. England and France advocate the establishment of a union of Danube River countries, while Germany and Italy do not agree. The afternoon meeting was devoted to studying statistics and data on the economic conditions of the Danube River countries. However, the disagreement was the same as in the morning. Some parties expect that the four countries can eventually reach a consensus agreement, but some kind of data is being collected, which cannot be obtained in one or two hours, so an agreement may not be reached tomorrow. According to responsible sources, the main point discussed today was the suggestion that a certain country should abolish its rights under the most-favored-nation treaty with a certain country in the Danube River. It is heard that the committee agreed in principle that the Danube River countries must stand on a self-sufficient basis, and any assistance given by other countries should be based on enabling the countries to develop themselves without external assistance. Relying solely on external assistance is definitely not enough to avoid the collapse of the Danube River countries, and the Danube River countries should establish an agreement on their future happiness themselves. Italy and Germany believe that the conference will be ineffective unless all the Danube River countries participate, and they also argue that Italy and Bulgaria should be included in the Danube River countries. They also said that many other countries are also related to the trade of the Danube River countries, and their interests are also very complicated, so it is almost impossible to obtain proposals that suit all parties' interests. The conference proceeded with great sincerity on the surface, but the participants still used their manipulation skills, unable to shake off the old habits of European rival countries for centuries. This kind of political maneuvering made the economic difficulties suffered by the Danube River countries even more unmanageable, so the discussion resulted in a stalemate. Although the participants unanimously said that they should urgently find ways to save the Danube River countries from bankruptcy, the main problems were not mentioned after the meeting began. The main point of contention was whether the five Danube River countries should conclude a customs union, or whether each country should clearly stipulate treaties with third parties. They held different opinions and failed to agree, so the progress of the conference was suspended. According to the above two proposals, they must be approved by all countries in the world that have most-favored-nation treatment treaties with the Danube River countries. At a time when many European politicians are now suspecting each other of having treacherous intentions, Sir Arthur Salter, Director of the Financial and Economic Section of the League of Nations, has just published a book entitled "Recovery," which details the economic and political reasons that led to the current crisis. The knight contributed to European civilization in only two ways: one is to realize the ideal of common security, and the other is to mutually conclude military alliances and wage world wars. The knight also mentioned the significant losses caused by private financial groups arbitrarily providing loans. The loans granted by the Swedish Kreuger &amp; Toll company to the Danube countries alone have approached 20 million English pounds.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 8th: The Four-Power Conference broke down at 11:30 this morning because it could not agree on a plan to save the economic difficulties of the Danube River countries. According to the final communique, the major powers all believed that the Danube River countries and other countries should take joint action as a matter of urgency to place the Danube River countries on a solid foundation. This is also the first step in the recovery of the European economy. After the meeting was discussed, it was found that there were many economic points that needed to be further studied. Because the League of Nations will hold an important meeting next week, the Four-Power Conference cannot continue. However, the four countries will still exchange views on the reserved points and continue to make progress in the best way, etc. This proves that the bright hope that the Danube River countries could be saved early has now disappeared. The only hope left is that perhaps the exchange of views between diplomats and the economic discussions of the League of Nations can overcome all difficulties and achieve something. It is generally recognized that the British delegation made great efforts to reconcile the differences between all parties, but unfortunately, the conference still ended in failure due to divergent opinions. At the end of the meeting, Foreign Minister Grandi said, "The matter is over. We have done everything we can." The German chief representative, Bülow, said, "From the beginning, I knew that such a complex problem could not be solved in three days."</p>
<p>National News, London, 8th: The Four-Power Danube River Conference has resolutely rejected the proposal to organize a customs union in the Danube River basin, because it is equivalent to restoring the economic organization of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Not only are there many opponents, but also there are thorns everywhere, and it is very difficult to realize. Furthermore, in this conference, in fact, it was also unable to agree on how many countries should be included in the Danube River basin. In addition, the major powers are unwilling to abandon their most-favored-nation rights in their commercial agreements with the Danube River states, which is also a major reason why the conference has fallen into a stalemate, and it is an element that has contributed to the rejection of the proposal to organize a customs union, because the major powers, even for the temporary mutual levying of preferential tax rates among the Danube River states, do not wish to easily agree.</p>
<p>National News, Sofia, 8th: The Bulgarian government has instructed its ambassador to the United Kingdom to send a letter to the British government, reapplying for Bulgaria to be listed as one of the Danube River states in the economic agreement to rescue the Danube River proposed by the major powers. According to a press release, the Bulgarian official document strongly stated that the country's finances, like those of other Danube River states, are exhausted to the extreme. If it does not receive the same rescue, it will go bankrupt.</p>

<p>Li Guilin's persuasion is ineffective. Anti-Japanese soldiers along the river recover Nong'an. Changchun, the puppet capital, is in great panic.</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: Xi Qia's enticement of Ding Chao and Li Du to surrender has recently been in vain. The issue in dispute is whether to hand over military power. Xi Qia only agreed to issue a batch of military pay, and refused all other requests. Ding and Li also refused to yield, so there were no results. Seeing that Ding and Li's resistance was very firm, the Japanese side forced Xi Qia's first and seventh brigades of the police and military on the 27th of last month to launch a sudden advance against the Liangzhuhe Self-Defense Army, intending to attack Ding and Li unprepared. However, the police brigades understood the Self-Defense Army and were unwilling to kill each other, so at the beginning of the battle, they only fired into the air. The Japanese army realized their intentions and immediately had the Amano Brigade supervise the battle from behind, using machine guns and artillery to suppress the front line. Therefore, the Self-Defense Army truly engaged the police brigades, and after a day of fighting, the Self-Defense Army was in a very advantageous position. However, Wang Zhiyou, who was negotiating peace in Harbin, was detained at this time. Xi Qia further telegraphed Li Guilin, using Wang's voice to persuade Ding and Li to cease fire. Li Guilin went to Liangzhuhe on a special train, still wanting to persuade Ding Chao in person. Ding, along with Zhao Yi, Feng Zhanhai, and others, avoided him and went to Yanshou. Only Xing Zhanqing and Chen Decai, because of their special relationship with Li, still met with Li. Li persuaded Xing and Chen to accept the conditions, gather at Yimianpo, and listen to the issuance of pay and reorganization. That night, Ding Chao received a letter in Yanshou and immediately ordered the Self-Defense Army to retreat to Fangzheng, to avoid military morale from collapsing. Xing and Chen's troops, with more than two thousand people, also retreated with Ding Chao, leaving less than four battalions who would listen to the reorganization. Li Guilin is still handling this matter on the Ha-Sui Line. After Ding Chao led his troops to retreat to Fangzheng, Yu Shenzheng led more than 10,000 of the puppet Jilin army, with the help of the Japanese army's Taniguchi and Ono brigades, launched a fierce attack on Fangzheng, fierce fighting for two days, several Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in the air, and fires broke out in many places in the city. The Self-Defense Army rescued the fire on one side and fought back on the other. The Japanese aircraft "Patriotic" flew very low while dropping bombs, and was shot down by the Self-Defense Army, and the driver died immediately. On the morning of the 31st, Gong Zhanhai's Self-Defense Army attacked and occupied Shixian County. At the same time, because the Japanese army rushed to Nong'an to reinforce, our army's strength was suddenly reduced, and the Self-Defense Army fiercely repelled Yu's army, and pursued them to the Gaolimaozi area, defeating a brigade of the puppet army. Fangzheng was then safe. Li Du is organizing military supplies and temporarily organizing volunteer armies in Yilan, for long-term resistance. The former National Salvation Army in Tailai Town, Heilongjiang Province, also arrived in Yilan, and was reorganized by Li into a detachment. Therefore, although there were fewer troops from Xing Zhanqing and Chen Decai, they were replaced by this, and the strength was not reduced. The Gong Zhanhai army, which occupied Binzhou, also retreated back to Fangzheng because Yu Shenzheng's troops cooperated with the Japanese army to counterattack. Yesterday, it was heard that there was still fierce fighting at Gaolimaozi, and Yu Shenzheng's puppet army was surrounded by the Self-Defense Army. The headquarters of the 2nd Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Harbin moved to Wujimi Station (140 li from Yimianpo) on the eastern section of the East China Railway on April 2. Personnel and supplies were transported by a special train. Division Commander Domon also followed, reportedly to launch a general attack on the national salvation armies of Wang Delin and Liu Zhenbang in Mudanjiang above Modaohezi. Wang Delin himself led his troops to attack along the Ji-Dun Railway. More than a thousand of Wang's troops have advanced to Mudanjiang Station on the eastern line. Liu Zhenbang's large army is in Muling, and recently recruited a large number of broadsword troops, numbering 2,000, with great momentum. The Japanese side is deeply worried, so it is anxious to attack, but it is also heard that the movement of the 2nd Division Headquarters is to facilitate the command of anti-Russian military affairs, and may need to be moved to Hengdaohezi in the future. As for the troops of the three brigades under Domon's command, except for the Murai Brigade being scattered along the Ha-Sui Line, the Amano and Taniguchi brigades rushed to Nong'an to reinforce on the 31st. The county seat of Nong'an is only 120 li away from Changchun, the puppet capital. At 5:00 AM on March 29, it was recovered by the 7,000 troops of Li Qingshan's National Salvation Volunteer Army, which had captured Fuyu. Liu Yukun's 1,500 troops of the first cavalry brigade stationed in the city had expelled their brigade commander and joined the National Salvation Army, so the recovery of the county seat was quite easy. The original Changchun Japanese Consulate Branch, consular staff and Japanese canvassers, and Japanese expatriates all fled to Changchun, causing great panic in the Changchun puppet court. Because there were not many stationed troops, 500 Japanese troops, 300 police, and Jin Bitong's 1,000-man garrison force took many cars to defend. On the way to Huangtulingzi (20 li from Nong'an), they were ambushed by the National Salvation Army, killing countless people and seizing seven carloads of supplies and ammunition. Only one car escaped. On the 30th, the Japanese side increased the Manchurian Railway garrison by 1,000 troops, together with Xi Qia's Ji-Chang garrison and seven Japanese aircraft to attack. The Japanese army launched a fierce artillery attack, and the city streets were destroyed by artillery fire, with countless military and civilian casualties. The volunteer army still calmly fought back. By the evening, the Japanese army was repelled. At noon on the 31st, the Japanese side changed to seven aircraft dropping bombs and bombing, and the merchants' residences in the city were destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>But the volunteer army was still not afraid. In the afternoon, the Japanese planes returned and left. On this day, a group of 3,000 volunteer bandits intercepted a transport team of Xi Qia's army, capturing a large amount of military supplies, as many as 20,000 rifles, 70,000 rounds of ammunition, and 50,000 mortar shells, all of which were carried into the National Salvation Army. The Japanese side was even more worried, so in addition to调 the Amano and Taniguchi brigades, it also调回 the Kaamura brigade, which had returned to Korea, and scheduled to concentrate at Huangtulingzi on April 1, and issued a general attack order on the 2nd. At the same time, Zhang Haipeng's bandit cavalry of 4,000 and Xi Qia's bandit army of 3,000 defended the puppet capital. Moriren, the commander of the Manchurian Railway Garrison, has been ordered by Honjo to command and has arrived in Changchun to plan. It is expected that there will be a fierce battle in the Nong'an area. (April 1)</p>
<h3 id="e138">Investigation Team Travels from Hankou Through Nanjing to Beijing <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>On the 7th, the investigation team departed from Pudong, scheduled to arrive in Beiping on the afternoon of the 9th. There were welcomes in both Bengbu and Xuzhou. According to the planned schedule, the investigation team left Hankou at 9:30 PM on the 5th. He Chengjun and others boarded the "Longhe" ship to see them off. Lord Lytton replied in Chinese, "Wishing you good health." When the investigation team returned from visiting the refugee reception center and Wuhan University in Wuchang, the city was already illuminated with countless lights. Only students from various schools and Boy Scouts were seen standing on the dock. As the wind and sand were severe at that time, the investigation team felt uneasy and boarded the ship first to bid farewell, and then went ashore for dinner. Lord Lytton was the last to return.</p>
<p>The impression the investigation team gained in Wuhan was better than expected, particularly praising the magnificent architecture of Wuhan University. As for the levee works, they thought they were too rudimentary and feared they would be insufficient to prevent flooding. At 9:00 AM on the 6th, when passing Jiujiang, representatives from various circles, including the garrison commander Guo Su, and the county magistrate Jiang Yi, boarded the ship to welcome them. However, representative Gu had already telegraphed Xiong Shihui to decline the honor. Lord Lytton and others freely disembarked to sightsee, but returned after only an hour. Many Westerners bought porcelain as souvenirs.</p>
<p>The representative of the Pingpu Railway under the Ministry of Railways finalized the special train schedule on board, as follows: ㈠ Depart from Pukou at 4:00 PM on the 7th, arrive in Jinan at 4:00 PM on the 8th; ㈡ Depart from Jinan at 7:00 PM on the 8th, arrive in Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 9th; ㈢ Depart from Tianjin at 2:30 PM on the 9th, arrive in Beiping at 6:00 PM on the 9th.</p>
<p>The reception organization finalized the disembarkation and boarding procedures. It was estimated that the "Longhe" would arrive in Nanjing at 1:00 PM on the 7th. The ship would dock in the middle of the river, and lunch would be on board. After lunch, they would take the "Chengping" ferry to Pukou. When disembarking from the ferry, the investigation team would go first, followed by the Chinese and Japanese representatives. The rest would wait until the luggage was transported before boarding the train with the Pingpu Railway reception staff. When boarding the train, the badge issued by the railway should be pinned on the lapel, and the assigned berth should be found according to the special pass. As for the luggage, it would be transported by the China Travel Service. Items with red paper would be placed in each person's room, while items with green paper would only be available for collection after arriving in Beiping. The badge was round and made of silk, with jujube-red color at the top and bottom. The top said "Welcome" and the bottom said "League of Nations Investigation Team". The center was white and printed with the Pingpu Railway emblem, which was quite beautiful. Personnel who could not be accommodated on the special train would take a special express train, departing at 7:00 PM on the same day. Because it did not stop en route, it would arrive in Beiping before the investigation team (sent from Nanjing on the 7th).</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Nanjing at 12:30 PM on the 7th aboard the "Longhe" ship. The ship docked in the middle of the river. While waiting for the "Chengping" ferry to arrive and unloading the luggage, Lord Lytton and four others, accompanied by Representative Gu Weijun, went to Foreign Minister Luo Wengan's private residence to bid farewell and review all important documents. They then crossed the river and boarded the special train, departing for the north at 4:10 PM.</p>
<p>The train belonged to the Beining Railway and was specially prepared for tourist groups. It was no less luxurious than those in Europe and America. Lord Lytton and Earl McCordie shared a car, General Claudel, Major General McCoy, and Dr. Heaney shared a car, Representative Gu Weijun and his confidential secretary shared a car, Secretary-General Dr. Haas and Deputy Secretary-General Pelt shared a car, and Japanese representative Isaburo Yoshida and his confidential secretary shared a car. In addition to the bedrooms, these five cars all had reception rooms. There was also a conference car, a dining car, several ordinary first-class sleeping cars, and a luggage car. Later, due to the increased number of people, the previous plan to take the Tianjin-Pukou through train was canceled. One first-class blue steel car and three third-class cars were added. The interior was extremely luxurious. Most of the equipment used was domestically made. The attendants were also trained and well-versed in Western customs. The Ministry of Railways also sent Yang Xianfen, Peng Like, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway sent Qian Zongyuan, Yang Jinbo, Yang Tianyun, Zhao Guodong, and the Beining Railway sent Hu Guanglu, Tan Yaozong, and Huang Juechen to take care of them along the way. In addition to the defense army providing protection along the way, the Capital Garrison Command also sent military police to protect the train, and the reception was very thorough.</p>
<p>When the train passed through Chuzhou, Mingguang, and other small stations, flags were raised to show respect. At 10:20 PM, it arrived in Bengbu. Local business representatives Sun Yuanfu, academic representative Ma Jingchang, agricultural representative Li Lingxiao, industrial representative Shao Ziying, press representative Dai Jiufeng, and party representative Xia Shi boarded the train to welcome them and presented welcome speeches.</p>
<p>The investigation team heard that Xuzhou had prepared a grand welcome, but as it was late at night, it was very inconvenient. Representative Gu specially telegraphed Commander Wang Jun to thank all circles and asked them not to trouble themselves (sent from Xuzhou on the 8th).</p>

<h3 id="e139">Ninety-Nine Steel Knives <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>—Zhang Yanxiang</p>
<p>I remember during the 1911 Revolution, Liu Bowen's "Shaobing Song" and the "Tui Bei Tu" were widely circulated. I especially liked the two lines: "Holding ninety-nine steel knives, killing all the barbarian children until they stop." They were quite encouraging. Yesterday, I recalled them again and pondered their meaning. I suddenly remembered that the Shenyang Incident was launched at 11:00 PM on September 18th, known as the "September 18th Incident." But by that time, it had already entered the midnight hour of the 19th, which exactly matches the number "ninety-nine." When the Shanghai Incident occurred, the 19th Route Army killed the invaders for the country with overwhelming force. The names of the three generals implicitly contained the succession of "ninety-nine." The head of General Commander Jiang's name "Jiang" has two "tens," the head of Army Commander Cai's name "Cai" also has two "tens," and the head of Commander Dai's name "Dai" has one "ten." The "Tian" character in the middle is another "ten." The lower "Gong" character has another two "tens." Commander Dai's given name "Ji" has a "ten" at the bottom. The "ten" at the top lacks a stroke, which can be said to be ten minus one, which is nine. The total happens to match "ninety-nine." Is this accidental? General Commander Jiang's given name "Nai" means nine tripods. Army Commander Cai's given name "Ting" means nine courts, which also implicitly shows the number ninety-nine.</p>
<p>The word "Hu" in the second line "barbarian children" can be divided into the two characters "Gu" (ancient) and "Yue" (moon), which can be matched with "Jinri" (today), which is present-day Japan. The right side of Army Commander Cai's name "Kai" is "Bi Ri" (compared to the sun). Commander Dai's name "Ji" contains "Ge Ri" (dagger-axe sun). They all contain the character "Ri" (sun), which is related to the "barbarian children" as Japan. The steel knives are our broadsword teams, which engage in close combat with the Japanese army.</p>

<p>When the Shanghai War was tense, American soldiers filled the area around Avenue Road and Kaifeng Road with barbed wire, blocking people's doors. Now the Shanghai War has turned to the west. The sound of gunfire has gradually receded and finally cannot be heard. However, the barbed wire in areas such as Avenue Road still blocks people's doors and has not been dismantled. Residents have to take detours or squeeze through the gaps, which is certainly inconvenient. But a middle-aged woman surnamed Gao said, "It's good that this damned barbed wire isn't dismantled. It's not bad to use it to dry my youngest son's diapers."</p>

<p>The mother of Little Lion goes out every morning carrying an empty basket. By evening, she always brings home a full basket of burnt wood. Mother Wang next door is envious. She asked Little Lion's mother, "Where do you go to get so much firewood?" Little Lion's mother said proudly, "I also spend capital. I have to buy three bananas and a box of cigarettes for the Japanese soldiers every day."</p>

<p>After the Shanghai War, there were several times more dogs than people in Zhabei. When I went to Zhabei, I noticed that the dogs' fur was shiny and very fat. The dogs' eyes were red. When they saw strangers, they would pounce on them like tigers, very fiercely.</p>
<p>Biology says that dogs are a subspecies of wolves. Although they are domesticated by people, they still retain the nature of wolves. Indeed, indeed.</p>

<p>The National Crisis Conference, which is difficult to produce, has repeatedly postponed its meeting, and members have been appointed in batches. The current government is eager to try. According to observations from all parties, it is predicted that the outcome of the conference will not be satisfactory. The only crux lies in the scope of discussion, which is limited to the three issues of resisting foreign aggression, disaster relief, and pacification. These three are indeed urgent tasks at present. However, foreign aggression did not begin today, and natural disasters and wars have occurred every year. What achievements has the current government made in its efforts over the years that can be gratifying to the people? It should also reflect deeply on itself. Therefore, to solve the national crisis today, it is necessary to "eliminate the one-party rule of division and cooperation and realize the constitutional government of national cooperation." This is the urgent prerequisite.</p>

<p>Shanghai War and Military Equipment (3)</p>
<p>—Yi Zang</p>
<p>Pistols</p>
<p>There are many types of pistols. They were originally created in Italy. They are generally used for defense when approaching the enemy and are a convenient and effective tool for self-defense. The military uses signal pistols, gas pistols, and new automatic pistols that can be as effective as light machine guns. The most common and representative pistol used by various countries is the Velgman automatic pistol. The caliber of its muzzle is 7.6 mm. The firing rate is 480 rounds per minute. The range is about 800 meters. This type of pistol can be imitated by factories in Northeast China. After the September 18th Incident, the Beidaying Arsenal was occupied by the Japanese army. It is said that tens of thousands of them were lost. So they used Chinese goods to fight the Chinese. We have to thank Zhang Xueliang for this gift. As for our country's original pistols, they were very simple iron products, like rifles. They used gunpowder and iron bullets. The technology was extremely immature, and their use was not very effective. The copper cap mechanism (made of phosphorus paper and covered with a copper cap) would often not fire if it was damp. And because too much gunpowder was loaded, the iron barrel would often explode. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, two or three of them were seized by the Japanese army. They are now displayed in the Yushukan at Kudanzaka in Tokyo. The reporter still remembers them vividly. As for the pistols captured by our army in the Zhabei and Jiangwan positions during this Shanghai Incident, most of them were Japanese Nambu-style automatic pistols and Type 14 automatic pistols. These pistols were improved by the Japanese based on the six-shot pistols sent by the Indian Viceroy to Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Beloly, referring to the Velgman model.</p>

<p>—Master of Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Marriage Proposals Press, Causing Hesitation and Self-Disturbance; Enemy Troops Seize Territory, Rekindling Old Conflicts</p>
<p>Who knew that An Yutian, being entangled by her for too long, had no intention of accepting her kindness and was instead annoyed by this trivial matter. He coldly replied, "Let it be. It's getting late. I'm going to sleep soon. I'll change it myself when I get up tomorrow." This kind of rejection, similar to issuing an eviction order, was no different from splashing a ladle of ice water on her boiling heart, greatly disappointing her. However, a lover who is not yet married must maintain a bit of politeness. Moreover, a woman must be even more self-respecting on the surface of etiquette. She could not express any contention at that moment, nor could she linger any longer. Unconsciously, she listened carefully, and there was silence in the courtyard. The neighbors in the public house were probably already asleep. Looking at the clock on the desk again, the hands were almost at one o'clock. With a melancholy and extremely unnatural bitter smile, she said, "I didn't realize I had been groping around until so late. Not only should you rest early, but I should also leave. Fortunately, our affairs have been discussed with some progress. Tomorrow, you just need to ask Mr. Wei to be the matchmaker, and it won't be difficult to settle. I'll still come here to see you in the evening. Everything can be discussed again." An Yutian no longer tried to keep her. He personally escorted her to the gate and hired a car for her. Before leaving, she repeatedly urged him to wait for her in the public house tomorrow night. He answered with a series of "yes" and sent her away. Returning to his room, he hurriedly went to bed to spread out the quilt and sleep. But it always seemed as if something, like a large stone, was lying across his chest, preventing him from falling asleep peacefully. He naturally pondered that this was the matter of Li Wenxia forcing him to announce their engagement. But the engagement was voluntary and had already been secretly agreed to verbally. In his heart, he really had no intention of regretting or shirking it. But strangely, in some inexplicable way, he always seemed to be unwilling to announce it and was unwilling to settle it so quickly. But what exactly was he waiting for? As soon as he closed his eyes, the noble and beautiful Liang Xiaoyun's figure would appear in his mind. However, Liang Xiaoyun was unequal in status. He didn't not know this. He really shouldn't have any expectations of her. It's just that in the darkness, it always seemed as if a god or demon was urging him. He was always unwilling to give up and must temporarily wait. Even though he knew it was useless, he always thought that there would be a wonderful opportunity in the future, and he could get unexpected gains.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Gold Standard Trend Steady and Healthy <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Continued rise of four taels. Yesterday, the trend of the gold standard was outstanding, once breaking out of 710 taels. Initially, the rise was due to the relentless decline in overseas silver markets, already seeing a new high price of 712.8 taels. Subsequently, the ups and downs were probably due to the different trends in foreign exchange rates for British pounds and US dollars. Because of the sharp drop in exchange rates, the market then turned weak due to large accounts selling off due to the poor situation. At noon, it was only counted between 705 taels. The aftermarket softened further, but the market situation was peaceful, with a high-low range of only about nine taels throughout the day. In the end, it continued to rise by 4 taels. People's hearts are still in a daze. The situation of the front and back markets is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning market was weak and then strong. The May opening surged by 11.2 taels to 711.5 taels. The major silver fell by 3/16, the small silver price by 3/8, and private telegrams by 9/16. Then it fell back by 1.5 taels, and immediately rose by more than 2 taels to 12.8 taels, due to the rush of short positions by Zhifengyong, Hengyu, and retail accounts. Later, sellers exceeded the limit, including Datacheng, Yiyu, Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, and Dalian gangs selling together, so it fell by 5 taels. As for the June British gold, it was tied to 8 pence. Until 9:30, the shilling exchange rate was announced unchanged, and the US dollar was slightly down 0.25. At this time, the gold price was 07 taels and 67 cents. It continued to fall to 06 taels and 2 cents. Then Bombay bought 180,625 June British gold. Later, Hengyu, Yifengyong, Datacheng, and others competed to buy, and a certain bank opened more than 100 cash transactions, so it rose by 5 taels. However, there was a fluctuation of one tael and several cents every half hour, reaching 11.5 taels at 10:15. Unexpectedly, the selling wind suddenly intensified. Speculators Wu and Dayuyong, Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, Yuankangxiang, etc. came to sell, mainly because the opening in the morning was too large and because of the unstable situation. The price could not be supported, and it fell by 6-7 taels in less than half an hour, to 04 taels and 8 cents at 10:30. Afterwards, it seemed to ease, with a swing of more than 2 taels. The exchange rate for each exchange was erratic. At 11:00, it was 07 and a half cents, and at 11:30, it was 5 taels and 1 cent. Then it added 1.34 cents, with limited transactions. The noon close was 05 taels and 7 cents. The listed price was 774 taels, with a discount of 67-68 taels to 62-63 taels. The noon close was 67-68 taels.</p>
<p>The after-market was exceptionally flat and tired. The after-market opened at 05 and a half taels. Then, Yifengyong, Datacheng, Tongtaichang, and others entered the market, rising by more than 3 taels to 08 and 7 cents. At 2:20, a small side was seen again, as Hengchangyong, Hengyu, and Guangbang Yifengxing sold off long positions. In addition, the current shilling could be exchanged for 180,625, and the Wheat Bank showed Citibank at 31.625 yuan. At 3:15, it was 04 taels. After entering the market, Qianchangxiang and others bought in, adding up to 06 taels. From 3:30 to 4:00, there were only a few cents up and down, between 06 taels. Afterwards, sellers never stopped, dropping to 4 taels. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 04 and a half taels, an increase of 4 taels and 2 cents compared to the previous day. The largest increase in one day was 12.8 taels, and the smallest was 04 cents, a difference of 8.8 taels. The listed price was discounted from 65 taels to 70 taels, the logged price was from 7 taels to 06 taels, the make-up water was 700 taels in the afternoon and 699 taels, and the red strips increased by 3 taels 7 and a half cents to 4 taels 7 and a half cents. Transactions were made among peers, and customer sales were still low.</p>
<p>Complex transactions of various exchanges. According to the statistics of transactions on the trading floor, Yifengyong, Datacheng, Yuankangxiang, Yuhe, Hengkangyong, and Hengchangyong all entered the market. Wanxing, Shunli, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, Futaiheng, Fuyu, and Wu all exited. Yuanmaoyong and Yuantai Tongtaichang were very busy in and out. In the afternoon, Yifengyong and Datacheng Hongkangyong all Zhifengyong and Hengyu Hengchangyong all exited. The rest of the exchanges were quite complicated.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Foreign Exchange Situation Still Tight <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>

As for the prices traded by banks, the British pound and the US dollar were tight, which was also the trend of exchange rate decline. However, it was strong in the morning and then loosened, which was because the gold price changed from sharp to flat. In the afternoon, the exchange rate and gold market seemed to be weak.</p>
<p>The result was better than the previous day, but the British gold was not lightly reduced, and the US dollar was reduced by 0.25. British exchange rate swaps started today, and it is the same as the US exchange rate. It is also tight near and loose far. It is found that the gold gang still occupies a short position in US dollars, but the number is less than last month. Recently, most of them are Wheat United. Morun is similar to Rodotong. There were many transactions yesterday, about 670,000 pounds in English, slightly less in Meng. There were also 780,000 yuan in gold transactions, with demand exceeding supply. Therefore, it is said that they are pulling near and releasing far.</p>

<p>Yesterday's city foreign cents languished due to light trading. The early market was 7 qian 08 cents and a half, and the noon market was only 7 qian 07 cents 8 hao 7 hu and a half. The selling sentiment was still rampant, so it is feared that there will be a continuous decline in the long run. The silver dismantling in the morning and noon was the same as 1 qian and 5 fen, which was the same as the previous day. The bank listing was still 6 points. The water head change fell by 1 qian, calculated as 3 qian. The exchange remittance amount in the morning market was 250,000, and 325,000 in the noon market. The banknotes were 10,000 in the morning market and 25,000 in the noon market. The bank check was 57,000, the exchange transaction was 650,000 in both markets, the foreign household transaction was more than 400,000, and the various receipts and payment messages totaled more than 4.3 million for the Hua Merchants Bank, more than 500,000 for the mortgage payment, more than 300,000 for the telegraphic transfer, more than 400,000 for the exchange remittance, more than 3.9 million for the Qianzhuang foreign public list receipt, more than 31 million for the silver public list receipt, more than 1.2 million for the foreign head payment, more than 2.1 million for the silver head payment, more than 300,000 for the small Qianzhuang transaction, the auxiliary coin Jiangnan small ocean was 6 qian 1 fen 6 li 2 hao and a half in the morning market, 6 qian 1 fen 5 li and a half in the noon market, the transaction was 2 angles in the morning market, 1,500 angles in the noon market, Guangdong small ocean was 6 qian 1 fen 7 li 7 hao and a half in the morning market, the same price in the noon market, the transaction was 70,000 angles in the morning market, 40,000 angles in the noon market, the copper coin was still 407,500 texts, the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Cocoon Tea Loan Situation <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>It is the spring season. In the cocoon tea producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, new goods will be launched one after another. Merchants in Shanghai who are engaged in this business had prepared for this in previous years and rushed to carry out their plans. But this year, when it is about to be the season, they are silent. However, the reason for the stagnation is that the financial community cannot release funds to the fullest extent, so that even the cleverest woman cannot cook without rice. Even if there is an opportunity to be made, how can their strength not be achieved? According to financial sources, they are not stingy in general with cocoon tea. Generally, those who are really killable can still have funds available. However, it is not like the previous year where you can press the loan or use the cushion release. Because this year, cocoon tea funds are treated as credit transactions, just like the bank's current account withdrawal. In the recent period, banks have released more than one million, and Qianzhuang has also released nearly one million (some say it has exceeded one million). However, the cocoon tea industry differs greatly from these small amounts of funds. A large-scale silver group must come forward to maintain it, or it can engage in the purchase of new goods. According to the current situation, new tea is about to be launched, and the cocoon season is still early, so we can engage in preparation early.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market situation is increasingly tired. The peace conference has become a stalemate again, which makes people inevitably worried, and the finance is difficult to loosen. Therefore, various gangs are not brilliant, and the sales channels are sluggish. As for the interior, they are all affected by the silver roots, and the yarn sales are cut off. If the external cotton situation is very pessimistic, then the future of the yarn market is still difficult to be optimistic. The 32-count decline is severe, and in the afternoon it secretly fell by several taels, but the market conditions have not been announced. Judging from the general situation, the market price still has a tendency to decline. Statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 300 bales throughout the day, and the market prices of fine yarns fell by 2-3 taels. The 20-count yarn fell by 0.5-0.75 qian. The customer gang imported 200 bales from Sichuan, 40 bales from Jiangxi, 10 bales from the interior, 38 bales from Ningbo, 45 bales from Shantou, 5 bales from Fujian, 5 bales from Nanyang, 5 bales from Wuhu, and 40 bales from the same trade.</p>

<p>The cotton market is still weak, and the spot sales are exceptionally deserted. Because the US and Indian cotton markets are trending tired, and the decline is sharp, the May period of 6 minutes has already broken through. Therefore, various factories are more and more indifferent in view of the decline in the world's cotton industry. However, some of them have a quantity to handle, but they want the price to be low, so they intend to absorb it. However, the sellers are unwilling to be too accommodating because the traffic is affected by the Japanese army and the source is difficult. As a result, the market situation is extremely dim.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to the poor performance of Wall Street and a lack of buying. Later, it strengthened due to some short covering. Futures fell by one to six points, and spot prices fell by five points. British cotton futures fell by two points, and spot prices fell by nine points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by fifteen points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with Broach cotton falling by 0.05 rupees. (Report from the 7th)</p>

<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, the source of green rice from various groups was insufficient due to bad weather, resulting in less arriving. Early in the morning, the city's shops experienced strong winds, and buyer sentiment was weak. Few fresh top-quality transactions occurred, and mid-grade goods became more active. Prices for goods from production areas gradually tightened. The price of Su Tong rice increased by another one or two dimes. There was a slight accumulation of early and thin second rice. Ningbo rice sales were slow, while sales in the city slightly improved, causing the market to immediately rise by two dimes. The sales of foreign Du Jian rice were normal, and the price did not rise or fall. Two hundred piculs of Bianyuan rice arrived yesterday, and distilleries immediately purchased them in large quantities, causing the price to jump by half a dollar.</p>
<p>Shanghai North: Yesterday, the supply from the west road was less than 10. Transactions on this street were slower than the previous market. Demand for thin rice from dim sum shops was still high, and prices rose by two dimes. The price of top-quality Su Chang rice was similar to the previous session, with mid-grade slightly increasing by five cents. Early rice and foreign Jian rice arrived and sold evenly, so the trend continued to rise. Various river factory goods sold about 3,500 piculs.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Reasons for Stagnation in Foreign Rice Sales to Hankou <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxi opened, transporting 20,000 bags of foreign rice to Hankou. Merchants in this street and rural villages are still planning to handle shipments of Haidao rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market initially heard that Hankou merchants had stopped buying. The southern situation was soft. Chongming merchants in the market sold several hundred bags. This street also continued to supplement the market, allowing it to remain stable. The reason for the Hankou merchants' cessation was that Jiangxi recently opened, and 20,000 bags of Jiangxi rice have been directly shipped to Hankou. It is expected that more shipments will continue. There are also rumors that Hunan province will also lift restrictions. Therefore, Hankou merchants are sourcing locally, reducing the amount shipped to Shanghai. However, the appetite of rural villages in this street is still good, so the Shanghai market can still remain stable.</p>
<p>The inventory of native customers' indica rice in this city has long been exhausted. Shipments have been absent for a long time, and arrivals are lacking even after the train line was cut off. Even the small number that is transported via civilian boats is not much. There is still some inventory of customer yuan rice. Yesterday, 136 bags of Jiangxi Jiyuan rice, totaling over 1,000 bags, were purchased by the Beiyang Quan Dao group at a price of 14.3 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Flour Price Reaches 2.21 Taels <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Futures buying was very active, and the price rose again by one cent. Yesterday's flour market showed a gradual upward trend in both the upper and lower markets. The May futures for the Battleship brand were supported by both factory and customer parties, and the upward trend was even stronger, with the price rising to 2.095 taels, a significant increase of one cent compared to the previous day. Spot flour followed closely, up 0.025 taels. Although there were no official offerings for the June futures, the market price has already crossed the 2.1 taels mark. Trading in the unified market futures was very active, with about 100,000 transactions, but all were net trades, not actual consumption by customers. The market was even more lively with ins and outs throughout the day, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Public Association's pricing session was still scarce due to the slight calming of the atmosphere after the sudden opening of road goods. Dutch Sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar fell to 13.1 taels, with the market showing little activity. The trend still appeared stable. Dutch fine granulated white sugar was at 13.2 taels, and No. 18 medium granulated white sugar was at 12.7 taels, with very little activity in and out. Taikoo refined B-mark was at 16.2 taels, with a lack of deliveries. HX mark rose from 14.55 taels to 6 cents, HM mark was at 13.525 taels, and H mark was at 12.2 taels with quite active trading. The market shape was very beautiful, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port gradually became active because European firms, in view of the Chinese silk merchants' insistence on selling only at higher prices, telegraphed their respective headquarters to report everything. Yesterday morning, New York and other ports telegraphed back to Shanghai, and silk prices turned upward. Yesterday, Luen Lok Bik imported 30 bales of White Factory silk, and Jardine Matheson imported 45 bales of Sichuan Yellow Factory silk, with prices firm and rising, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Piece Goods: Local Shops Active in Handling Coarse Twill <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market has been trending steadily in recent days. Actual sales have been difficult to show improvement for the time being because the overall situation is uncertain. Inland groups have almost completely stopped, while Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other ports are still active, but purchases are also limited. Domestically produced drills are gradually falling in price. Hongzhang Three Sheep is selling for 0.375 taels, Jiangyin goods Fang He Ting is selling for 0.315 taels, and Quan Sha's Lun Chang goods are only selling for 0.26 taels. Jiangyin goods of Zhigong呢 are also selling for 0.315 taels, a drop of 0.5-0.6 taels compared to the winter of the previous year. The decline in Western goods' Su Fu silk is very severe. He Kangde goods are opening at 0.375 taels, and tailoring is at 0.55 taels. Xiashan Yuan Yu silk is particularly lacking, so there is a general impression that foreign goods are hard to find. However, Xiashan goods are now being converted into coarse twill dyed Yuan colors and stepped on for light, which can be used together with Dong goods' Yuan Guang twill. Therefore, coarse twill has an unexpected outlet. Yesterday, San Yu was at 5.25 taels, San Tu was at 5.2 taels, and Mao Ying was at 5.1 taels. The market for fine cloth and fine twill was stable yesterday, and there were signs of softness in coarse cloth, it is said.</p>

<p>The recent trade in British steel plates has become stagnant again, leading to standard soft selling. Currently, 0.025 inches are selling for 9.5 taels, 0.05 inches for 6.5 taels, 0.075 inches for 6.15 taels, and 0.1 inches for 5.5 taels. Compared to the opening market price, they have all fallen by 0.2-0.3 taels. According to the Public Association's news, there are discussions to maintain the price due to the high costs. However, foreign firms are selling their spot goods in the market, and hoarders are also returning their inventory. Due to oversupply, there is a lack of methods to regain popularity.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Military Expenses and the Buddha <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Only the Nineteenth Route Army once had a day to "Raise soldiers for a thousand days to use them for one day." This is an ancient saying with experience and reason. But since we talk about raising soldiers, it is natural that there can be no expenses. Therefore, military expenses were originally a large part of the country's legitimate expenditure, and also a kind of burden that the people should bear.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw a telegram from Beijing saying that the national military expenditure, after being reviewed and approved by the government, is 10 million yuan per month, to be allocated by the Ministry of Finance. Roughly looking at this telegram, it is not a strange thing. But when I calculate it, 10 million yuan per month is 120 million yuan per year. I don't know how much the government's total annual income is. However, I remember that the government also has so-called education expenses, industrial expenses, etc., which are also very important. I don't know how much the government approves each month. If they also distribute 10 million yuan per month like military expenses, I wonder if the government has such a corresponding income.</p>
<p>I will not worry about this problem for the time being. What I want to talk about now is that the 10 million yuan approved by the government and allocated by the Ministry of Finance, I don't know where the Ministry of Finance will get this 10 million yuan from? I think it must be accumulated from the sweat and blood of our ordinary people, and a part of it is taken out from the hard work of ordinary people to provide it.</p>
<p>Let me ask again, why do ordinary people go to provide such huge expenses? Why do ordinary people willingly take it out to provide it? Because the responsibility of the soldiers was originally the four big characters of "Defend the Country and Protect the People", which is what I said above, "Use it in one day". Alas!</p>
<p>I think of this one day. I am watching this one day.</p>

<p>Zhuzun wrote "Mozi's Idle Talk, Supplemented and Corrected", spending more than ten years, searching the words of hundreds of scholars, and compiling a book of hundreds of thousands of words. Mr. Chen Shiyi of Houguan praised him as a friend who could argue with Sun Zhongrong, and Mr. Tang Weizhi of Xishan called him the culmination of Mozi's learning. Five years ago, it was handed over to the Commercial Press for typesetting and printing, and was printed in over a thousand pages in small type. It was about to be bound when the Commercial Press was destroyed by the Japanese army, and my book also suffered the disaster. I wrote a poem to mourn it.</p>
<p>Who pities the anti-war theory repeated thousands of times? Again I see an unprecedented war disaster unfold. Universal love has the same intention as God. (It is said that Mozi's theory has something in common with Christianity) Without blackening, there is no way to quell the ashes of Qin. Years of experience have dimmed the wind and dust. The enmity between Yan and Ying becomes the sorrow of drums and horns. I have failed my friends' kindness for ten years. Letters urging the book's publication have come frequently in vain. (In the past ten years, the study of Mozi has flourished greatly, and many scholars at home and abroad have written to ask about the publication of my book.)</p>

<h3 id="e161">Cadaver Poison Storage <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The day after the sound of artillery ceased in Zhabei and Wusong, I went to Zhabei to take a look, which made me heartbroken. In the usually bustling streets and alleys, there were Chinese corpses everywhere. The day before yesterday, I went around for another week. These corpses were naturally gone, but in the nearby fields, there were shallow graves everywhere. Walking past them, the air was very different from other places. I therefore thought that these honest Chinese people had already been brutally killed by the enemy's guns and cannons, but they were very unwilling to leave behind the cadaver poison, which was being released with the gradually warmer weather. So I wrote this "Cadaver Poison", partly to express grief for the dead, and partly as a reference for those fighting against Japan.</p>
<p>When animals or human bodies decay, the organic substances contained in them are transformed by a kind of bacteria to form various cadaver poisons. This is a class of alkaline toxins, whose toxicity varies in strength. According to research by Koelker, cadaver poison occurs 24 to 28 hours after the body decays, with the strongest toxicity. The toxin contained is called neurine. After 5 to 6 days, the toxicity is weaker. Although the chemical structure of cadaver poison has not been determined, it produces a significant reaction when using the plant alkali test. Therefore, forensic chemists must use the plant alkali method to conduct various tests when examining corpse toxins, and then determine which plant alkali the deceased died from before his death.</p>
<p>The physiological reactions of cadaver poison on living organisms are often different from those of plant alkaloids. Therefore, many people die from poisoning, because the main toxin contained in cadaver poison, neurine, is very strong. Its toxic physiological action is to paralyze the nervous system and worsen the heart. The symptoms include dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, dilated pupils, weak pulse, cold limbs, and finally general paralysis, loss of consciousness and death. As for the method of detoxification of cadaver poison, atropine is usually used, because atropine can have the opposite effect to neurine.</p>

<p>The rich people in society who seek fame through waste are nominally different from fools, but in reality they are almost the same, because the extravagant things done by the rich and the foolish things done by the fools are actually not much different. Now let's take two examples of extravagant things done by the rich to prove my point of view.</p>
<p>The wife of a certain chairman lives in the Western District of the Shanghai International Settlement, which is close to the small vegetable market. However, she does not go to the nearby small tea market to buy vegetables every morning, saying that the prices are too expensive. Therefore, she takes her car to Mongol Road in Zhabei every day to buy fish and meat. This kind of extravagant method of thrift, if the gasoline used by the car is compared with the money saved from the small vegetable market, can be used as evidence that extravagance and foolishness are similar.</p>
<p>My friend teaches in the home of a certain wealthy man. Recently, this master's family property was sealed due to litigation, and my friend has to go to that humble temporary residence to teach every day. This Dongweng gentleman, in order to save a dinner, sends the teacher home by car (because my friend lives in the west of Shanghai) after completing the reading lesson at 6 pm every day. This is another extravagant calculation, which is similar to that of a fool.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Radio is a Tool of National Subjugation by Mian Yi <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Many people will find this topic very strange. Radio is the latest crystallization of modern material civilization and scientific development. Thanks to the invention of radio, people have been given a lot of convenience. Every country relies on it as a weapon for military and transportation. How can it be a tool of national subjugation? Moreover, radio is more developed in the UK and the US than in China. Why don't they perish, but instead become richer and stronger, and when they come to China, they become a tool of national subjugation?</p>
<p>No matter what happens, it cannot escape the good and bad sides. For example, the modern new inventions of science, on the good side, it is true that the more developed science is, the more civilized materials are, and people get a lot of enjoyment, but from the bad side, the more developed science is, the easier it is to kill people, and the more barbarous human beings become, which is exactly the opposite. Radio is also the same. If you use it well, you will become richer and stronger. If you don't use it well, it is a tool of national subjugation.</p>
<p>In European and American countries, almost every family is equipped with a radio. Their purpose is to make national news unimpeded, so once a major event occurs, it is broadcast by the radio station, and the people of the whole country know it in an instant. The second is to invite celebrities to give lectures to increase people's knowledge. Entertainment is the least important purpose, but China is exactly the opposite. Entertainment is the most important purpose, and what is broadcast every day is completely entertainment programs. As for celebrity speeches or national events, it is really hard to come by. In the event of January 28, Japan knew about it throughout the country within an hour, but China had to open the newspaper tomorrow to find out. Isn't this an obvious fact?</p>
<p>Because China's purpose of installing radio is entertainment, a group of bourgeois people and idle classes used to have to go out to get the pleasure of seeing and hearing, but now they only need to install a radio, and they don't even have to go out the door, and they can get all kinds of entertainment, so they accompany their wives and concubines at home all day long, indulging in licentious pleasures, and ignoring any major events. It is true that with one machine in hand, all thoughts are empty. Fortunately, China still cannot afford to have everyone equipped with a radio, otherwise, wouldn't the country's major affairs be unattended to? If it doesn't perish at this time, when else will it?</p>
<p>I earnestly hope that the domestic radio industry will pay attention to this point.</p>

<h3 id="e164">University Students' Love Sickness by Yi Zang <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Albert Hegar, the president of Missouri State University in the United States, has published interesting opinions on solving the love sickness of general university students.</p>
<p>He said that to make students concentrate on their studies, the first thing to solve is their love sickness. To solve this problem, is to support their lovers to get married, because most male and female students often flirt with each other in the classroom, and they turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the teacher's explanation. When the teacher asks a question, they stare blankly and don't know how to answer. When they leave the class, they rush to the lounge to look for the students they love, and offer their affection. If they can't find that lover, most of them skip class and go out.</p>
<p>Every morning, they rush to school to wait outside the door. After school, if there are male and female couples who love each other, they will naturally go out happily in pairs. If there are people who are not matched, they will look like stray dogs, pacing around with their heads down and dejected, making all kinds of homework put aside. Therefore, students who usually have good grades, once infected with this love sickness, none of them can pass the test every time. So, to make students learn, the first thing is to solve their symptoms. This is what I (Dr. Hegar) have gained from past experience. In my opinion, for students in the university who have one-sided thinking patients, it is best to set up a marriage opinion box. Which student looks at which person, can vote by name as much as possible. After opening the votes, if there are three or four male students who want to win the favor of the princess, the student can be allowed to choose freely. This is very fair. Dr. Hegar also said that when the number of university students getting married increases in the future, the school should set up nurseries to avoid them having too many worries.</p>

<p>Medical and Pharmaceutical Review Agency: According to the Medical and Pharmaceutical Review Agency, the Medical and Pharmaceutical Review Agency was initiated in the winter of the Republic of China in 1928 by dozens of medical and pharmaceutical experts in Shanghai, including Dr. Chu Minyi, Wang Qizhang, Yu Yunxiu, Xie Yingrui, and Zhou Mengbai. Soon, Dr. Chu Minyi was publicly elected as the editor-in-chief to publish the Medical and Pharmaceutical Review Semi-Monthly. In the past three years, more than 70 issues have been published. The opinions in it, regardless of new or old medicine and pharmaceuticals, are all ingenious and precise. One paper is popular, and there are thousands of subscribers at home and abroad. Recently, the Japanese have been showing their tyranny and disregarding public reason. The dark curtain of their medical and pharmaceutical names invading our country has been revealed one by one, and a list of Chinese medicines and other countries' medicines that can replace Japanese medicines has been compiled. In addition, texts on scientific defense such as green gas bombs and poison gas have also been researched and published. Subscriptions for the whole year of 24 issues only cost one yuan for postage. To request a sample issue, send a letter to No. 408, Rue Albert, with five cents for postage, and it will be sent immediately.</p>
<p>China English Day and Night School: China English Day and Night School, located at the intersection of Nanshi Road on Nanjing Road, has been established in Shanghai and Hangzhou for many years. It was founded by Dr. Raimon from the West and Dr. Song Ziqiang. The individual classes and special classes specially set up by the school have excellent grades, because its teaching method is suitable for the students' level, very detailed and earnest. The courses and time can be determined by the students themselves, so that the students do not interfere with their legitimate work, and can come and go casually day and night, and be taught as soon as they arrive. Therefore, those who register for the class are very enthusiastic.</p>
