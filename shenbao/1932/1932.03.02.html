<h3 id="c1">異哉松岡洋右之游說彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日軍閥一手撕碎國際盟約。破壤世界和平。去年九一八突然强佔我東北。今年一二八復進窺我淞滬。企圖以斬斷財源威脅我政府屈服。以擾亂市塲逼迫列强讓步。此種野心與暴行。已昭示世界以日人對於正義與和平所應負荷之鉅責。</p>
<p>在目前日軍閥正　扈飛揚肆其慘毒之際。近忽自東京來一「特客。」自命代表犬養毅個人。爲緩和上海局勢而來。蓋即前任「滿鐵副總裁」「滿蒙通」「政友會之要角」之松岡洋右是。此高貴之客來滬後。即寓居於黄浦江頭之華懋飯店。旦夕游說於歐美僑滬人士之間。其發言。記者雖未耳聞。但如歐美友人所轉述。則其持論與曩年在西京太平洋會議席上所侃侃而談者。與彼最近所著「動搖之滿蒙」一書中所錚錚而論者。正無不符合。　　松岡所游說者計有七點。一、爲滿蒙問題不承認中國有干涉之資格。二、爲日本爲遠東之主人。列强應承認日本之亞細亞門羅主義。三、爲九國公約。日本係受壓迫而簽字。無遵守之必要。四、爲現在中國紛亂日本應維持治安。俾列强得以安全從事貿易。五、爲膺懲中國。六、爲戰至中國屈服求和訂立城下之盟而後止。七、爲日本將改造遠東局面。即維持九國公約。與蘇聨携手之二途。上述七點。旣荒謬。亦復毒辣。茲請嚴辭痛關如次。　　第一·東北爲我國之領土。我有神聖之主權。爲世界所公認。去年九一八日突然强佔我東北是則爲維護我領土行政主權之完整。我自有收回失地之必要。第二·美國之門羅主義。乃爲對於歐洲各國干涉南美各國内政而發以任何一國不能侵害他一國之主權爲原則。今日軍侵中國。原則上已與門羅主義相背馳。則所謂亞細亞門羅主義者。除解爲以武力獨覇亞洲而外。究將何以自圓其說。第三·九國公約訂於華盛頓會議席上。日不僅未受任何壓迫。且曾取得多種交換利益。第四·中國之紛亂。都爲日本財閥軍閥所一手造成。彼輩且以此爲對華之一貫政策。日本之發言人。在國際間常以「非現代的」「無組織的」國家侮辱我國。吾人茲請反問最近「日軍閥不經天皇敕令。擅向我國不宣而戰。」「井上被剌。」「外交人員對外發言不能負責。」「總選舉用武力壓迫」之種種事實。果能謂爲有組織之國家乎。日軍在滬恣意屠戮婦孺。又果能謂爲現代文明國家乎。自上海禍變以來。各國貿易爲之破壞殆盡。尙能安心從事貿易乎。第五·不曰侵略。而曰膺懲。無非欲以此矇蔽世界人士之耳目。日本究亦曾思及此種倒行逆施。將引起世界對日之膺懲否乎。第六·城下之盟。吾人今已認淸决謀長期之抵抗。以待國際之變化。及日軍閥自身之崩潰。日軍閥一日不罷兵。我國一日不停止抵抗。</p>
<p>至於最後所謂改造遠東局面之兩種政策。前者爲向列强暗送秋波。固早爲世界所齒冷。後者則爲威嚇列强讓步。日本旣已極力宣傳佔據滿蒙以防赤化。更積極向蘇聨挑睘固尙安有聨蘇聨之可能。就使能之。但彼時華盛頓政府或亦將先正式承認蘇聨。以打破日本之陰謀。是則日本究將以此向誰要脅耶。</p>
<p>總之。日本財閥軍閥政客之野心。早已爲世界人士所深悉。列强安有不能忍受目前上海暫時之苦痛。而甘心放棄未來世界政治經濟之立塲。史汀生致波拉函。已明白表示反對日政府之政策與日軍閥之行動矣。國際輿論。亦已顯然對日譴責矣。彼松岡之游說。將安所施其技倆耶。</p>

<p>陣地五失五得</p>
<p>今晨仍在激戰</p>
<p>閘北一帶大火</p>
<p>前日敵軍傾其全力、猛攻閘北八字橋一帶、雙方晝夜血戰、我軍防綫、凡三失三得、敵軍死傷、達三千人以上、戰事之烈、實較曹家橋江灣等役爲烈、可謂一二八以來第一大戰、而天通菴·竹園墩·小塲廟等處、更爲敵軍砲火之焦點、鏖戰至昨日正午、記者自大塲脫險返館時、砲聲猶隆隆不斷、詎至下午二時後、敵軍竟收拾殘餘、增加援軍、第四次向八字橋迤北一帶等處、繼續猛攻、激戰之烈、尤甚於前三次、最後凡五失五得、我軍仍固守陣地也、茲將各方情形、探錄於次、</p>
<h3 id="c9">敵四次攻八字橋敵軍在八 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>字橋經兩晝一夜之苦戰、至昨晨已力盡精疲、至九時許、敵援軍又到、集中約三四千人、復利用其集團砲兵及三四十門之各式重砲、及大批飛機爲掩護、作第四次之猛烈進擊、砲彈到處、房屋立時起火、蓋敵軍所用完全爲硫磺彈及霰溜彈也、飛機所擲炸彈、無一彈在百磅以内者、加之鐵甲車威脅更甚、敵步兵得此最大之助力、更乘勢作猛烈之衝鋒、當時我軍見敵來勢過猛、爲避免犧牲計、僅以機關槍稍加抵抗、至正午十二時許、我軍即向後撤退約一百米突、</p>
<h3 id="c10">收失地再度肉搏當時我軍 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>撤退一百米突後、立即調動大批生力軍、向該處增援、至下午一時許、我軍更四度反攻、均視此處爲全綫關係所繫、□師師長並親赴該處指揮、我軍士氣更覺百倍、人人均抱犧牲决心、全軍同時動作、以多數之手提機關槍爲前導、猛向敵軍陣地衝擊、喊殺之聲、震撼遠近、同時我軍大刀隊已滖滾進敵陣、刀光四射、血肉横飛、鏖戰歷一時四十分之久、敵陣全潰、紛紛竄退、於是遂仍佔原有陣地、並檢獲敵軍機槍數挺、步槍三百餘枝、鋼帽子彈無數、嗣後敵即用大砲不斷轟擊、無一分鐘之間斷、待至薄暮敵軍又取攻勢、迄至今晨、攻擊益亟、但我軍仍固守原線、屹然未動、</p>

<p>間所發砲彈、在閘北一帶落下者、都爲硫磺彈、因此每彈到處、大火隨之、八字橋方面、有三處大火、竟日未熄、惟無大統路及虬江路之利害、虬江路方面九如里、已全部燒燬三多里亦已延及入晚已移向西部大統路方面、於下午三時五十分起、被日機擲彈後、亦起大火、延燒甚烈、入晚更熾、遙見一片通紅、火焰萬丈、至繕稿時、火勢尙有加無已、</p>

<p>敵軍砲轟竟無片刻停息</p>
<p>我軍以敵屍作障蔽衝鋒</p>
<p>前日敵之主力攻我八字橋及沿閘北一帶、不能動我分毫、昨日拂曉、又日軍猛攻小塲廟竹園墩、敵方大砲飛機偵察威脅經過、達十餘小時之久、敵我雖有一度進退、但結果我軍終將敵擊退、主陣綫仍毫無變動、茲將戰情錄下、</p>
<h3 id="c13">竹園墩殲敵 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>敵前日分三路猛攻八字橋天通菴至昨早十時、仍向廟行江灣間之竹園墩小場廟進襲、我軍駐防該處者爲□□師一部、見敵來即奮勇迎擊、戰約半小時、敵即派出兩大隊、一向江灣前進、一在竹園墩衝鋒、同時敵軍大砲砲彈密集、向同一地點轟擊、預計一句鐘内所落砲彈、近三百粒、空間並由飛機投彈、激戰之烈、較曹家橋一役有過之無不及、至十一時許戰更烈、我軍憑竹園墩東河浜而守、敵軍連續衝鋒、舞間斷之時、我軍陣綫一度稍稍後退約二百米之地、其時敵亦跟蹝而進、來勢愈猛、當此緊逼關頭、我援軍開上、實行抄襲、敵祗得匆匆而退、然已不及、被我擊斃、達二百餘名、</p>
<h3 id="c14">火綫之距離 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>廟行江灣小塲廟竹園墩等陣綫、敵我相距最近處僅二十餘碼、步槍亦失效力、上午十時、敵以攻八字橋之兵、改攻小塲廟、據口旅軍官談敵昨日攻擊最烈之處、爲廟行至竹園墩一段中、最近時雙方均以手溜彈撲擊、故一俟出壕、即與衝鋒、敵砲火雖烈、對我實毫無辦法、</p>
<h3 id="c15">敵屍作障蔽 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>國聞社記者所叩運回傷兵、據談、敵在竹園墩廟行、遺死纍纍、我軍屢退屢進者、幾數度矣、當我軍進攻衝鋒時、全以敵屍作障蔽、本日江灣以北至廟行一綫、均有劇烈戰爭、余傷手退下、棉服即爲手溜彈所炸破、戰事至現時（午後四時）止尙未停止云云、</p>
<h3 id="c16">吳淞方面戰况 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>

<p>▲敵艦利用商輪開砲</p>
<p>▲敵機到處抛擲炸彈</p>
<p>▲均無損害我軍陣地</p>
<p>昨日戰事、側重於八字橋·竹園墩·及廟行一帶、故吳淞方面、較爲沉靜、除下午敵艦一艘、藉商輪掩護、偷向砲台開砲數響外、竟日並無激烈之槍砲聲、惟自早晨七時起、有敵機九架、向吾砲台及薀藻浜陣地、擲彈破壞、但多未命中、我軍毫未受損、關於吳淞方面之各項消息、彙誌如次、</p>

<p>柏林日爾曼尼亞中央黨機關報評論云、日本提議在某數種條件下、準備停止敵對行動之舉、確爲一種進步、日本現在之所以抑制其慾望者、實因中國軍隊抵抗勝利、與華盛頓政府發表宣言所致、此外列强通牒請其將司令部與軍艦退出公共租界、而日本金融財政狀况均不見佳、國内復有反抗軍閥行動之表示、凡此種種、皆爲日本提議停戰之原因、日本原冀上海一隅、彈指可下、迨軍書告捷、再與中國進商滿洲問題、彼時日本軍威旣立、不患中國之不俯首就範、而其他列强亦不復堅持異議、此種計畫現在已成泡影、日本軍隊近年以來、戰無不勝、此次敗北、固日人始料所不及者、其一再增援、延長戰事者、蓋欲僥倖一勝、以恢復其軍威耳、否則日本在上海之軍事行動、恐早久停止矣、且國聨特别大會不日開幕、日本應付之困難、將更甚于以前之行政院、日本于此思之已熟、宜其急于改變方針也、（二十九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>就是主在中日涉前、不能有任何先决條件、　是針付日本從前所提的交涉、以先决的五項基本原則而發的、所以我們接受三國的調停、而日本則不肯接受、後來三國又提第二次調停、要求先在滬停戰、然後解决東北問題、我們明知上海與東北問題、是不能分的、所以我們的答復、是如果解决上海問題爲解决東北問題的第一個步驟、則中國可以接受、但日方則不特回答而突向上海市長下哀的美敦書、對於此事、經兄弟於本月二十日已有通電、日本之無理要求、甚至有吳淞砲台不得從新設備、是直以庚子各國對於大沽砲台前例相加、故中國當然不能接受、而日本更不待答覆、再次進攻了、此後各國的與論、均責備日本、現在三日之後、國聨便開特别大會、討論中日問題、我們希望國聨開大會時、可以引用盟約第十六條、各國對日實行經濟封鎖、雖不能决其能通過、而我們必要抵抗、然後方能引起國際注意、由此可見了、所以此次上海抵抗、一面予日本一個嚴重敎訓、使他知道欲亡中國、斷不是容易的一回事、一面是增加各國對中國的信用、此外還有一個重要意見、便是提起民族的意識、今次抵抗、不獨軍隊抱必死决心、即滬居民、亦絶不以破家亡身爲念、更勇敢輸捐、援助前敵將士、甚至黨外的人、亦一致擁護政府、而黨内同志、團結一致、更不待言了、這便是民族意識的振揚、雖不敢說是我民族復興的機會、至少可見我民族意識還好、就算亡國、也是流血的亡國、至於政府應援上海駐軍、現已有事實證明了、此後如日本繼續增兵、我們亦必繼續增援的、這種擴大戰事的責任、是由日本負担的、現在一般人有兩種不同意思、一種人以爲就中國現在的財力和軍備、絶不能與日戰、一種人以爲中國對日本戰、必可操勝算、雖然看去矛盾、但都有眞理在、因爲照普通戰爭看去、中國的軍備財力、當然打不過日本、但一個被壓迫民族抵抗帝國主義的侵略、是以他的民族全體力量作殊死戰的、所以不能以普通戰爭的比較、來作勝敗的標準的、這是完全取决于民族要亡不要亡的念頭的、　　絶交宣戰的話、現在是不應講、因爲日本是　　的、尙不公然宣戰、我們是正當防衛的、更不必說宣戰了、我們要悲壯而不可誇大、誇大是自欺欺人、悲壯才是死力抵抗的决心、我們爲民族生存起見、應該抵抗、而且必要抵抗、對内可以提起中華民族的意識、對外可以抑制日本的野心、增加中國在國際上的信用、這是中國生死存亡關頭、也是我們唯一的出路、</p>

<p>The Japanese militarists have single-handedly torn up international covenants and shattered world peace. Last year, on September 18th, they suddenly and forcibly occupied our Northeast. This year, on January 28th, they again encroached upon our Songhu (Shanghai). Their intention is to cut off our financial resources, threatening our government into submission, and to disrupt the market, forcing the powers to yield. This kind of ambition and brutality has shown the world the great responsibility that the Japanese should bear for justice and peace.</p>
<p>At this time, when the Japanese militarists are running amok and committing atrocities, a "special guest" suddenly arrived from Tokyo, claiming to represent Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi personally, coming to ease the situation in Shanghai. This person is none other than Matsuoka Yosuke, the former "Vice-President of the South Manchuria Railway," a "Manchuria and Mongolia expert," and an "important figure in the Seiyukai party." After arriving in Shanghai, this distinguished guest resided in the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, daily lobbying among European and American expatriates in Shanghai. Although reporters did not hear his speeches firsthand, according to what European and American friends relayed, his arguments are entirely consistent with what he spoke eloquently at the Pacific Conference in Tokyo in the past and with what he argued strongly in his recent book "The Wavering Manchuria and Mongolia." Matsuoka's lobbying points are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Regarding the Manchuria and Mongolia issue, China has no right to interfere.</p>
<p>2.  Japan is the master of the Far East. The powers should recognize Japan's Monroe Doctrine for Asia.</p>
<p>3.  The Nine-Power Treaty was signed by Japan under duress and does not need to be observed.</p>
<p>4.  China is currently in chaos. Japan should maintain order so that the powers can safely engage in trade.</p>
<p>5.  Punish China.</p>
<p>6.  Fight until China surrenders and sues for peace, signing a treaty of subjugation, and only then stop.</p>
<p>7.  Japan will transform the Far Eastern situation, either by maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty or by joining hands with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The above seven points are both absurd and vicious. I now offer a stern and painful critique as follows:</p>
<p>First, the Northeast is our country's territory. We have sacred sovereignty, which is recognized by the world. The sudden and forcible occupation of our Northeast by Japan last September 18th means that in order to maintain the integrity of our territorial and administrative sovereignty, we have the necessary right to recover our lost territories.</p>
<p>Second, the United States' Monroe Doctrine was issued in response to European countries interfering in the internal affairs of South American countries, based on the principle that no country can infringe upon the sovereignty of another country. Today, Japan's invasion of China, in principle, is already contrary to the Monroe Doctrine. Then, what is the so-called Asian Monroe Doctrine if not a hegemonic grab for Asia by military force? How can it justify itself?</p>
<p>Third, the Nine-Power Treaty was signed at the Washington Conference. Japan was not only not under any duress but also obtained various exchange benefits.</p>
<p>Fourth, the chaos in China is entirely caused by Japanese financial groups and militarists. They even use this as a consistent policy towards China. Japanese spokespersons often insult our country in international arenas as an "unmodern" and "unorganized" nation. We now ask in return: can the recent facts that "Japanese militarists launched an undeclared war against our country without an imperial order," "Inoue was assassinated," "diplomatic personnel cannot be held responsible for their external statements," and "the general election was suppressed by force" be said to be the actions of an organized country? Can the wanton slaughter of women and children by the Japanese army in Shanghai be said to be the actions of a modern civilized country? Since the Shanghai incident, the trade of various countries has been almost completely destroyed. Can they still safely engage in trade?</p>
<p>Fifth, instead of calling it an invasion, they call it punishment, merely attempting to deceive the eyes and ears of the people of the world. Has Japan ever considered whether this kind of perverse behavior will provoke the world's punishment of Japan?</p>
<p>Sixth, as for a treaty of subjugation, we have now clearly resolved to engage in long-term resistance, awaiting international changes and the collapse of the Japanese militarists themselves. As long as the Japanese militarists do not cease their troops, our country will not stop resisting.</p>
<p>As for the last so-called two policies for transforming the Far Eastern situation, the former is a secret courtship of the powers, which has long been disdained by the world. The latter is to threaten the powers into yielding. Japan has already vigorously promoted the occupation of Manchuria and Mongolia to prevent the spread of communism. Furthermore, Japan is actively provoking the Soviet Union. How is it still possible to ally with the Soviet Union? Even if it were possible, the Washington government might first formally recognize the Soviet Union to thwart Japan's conspiracy. Then, whom will Japan threaten with this?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the ambitions of Japanese financial groups, militarists, and politicians have long been deeply understood by the people of the world. How can the powers willingly abandon their future political and economic position in the world by merely tolerating the temporary suffering in Shanghai? Secretary Stimson's letter to Borah has clearly expressed opposition to the policies of the Japanese government and the actions of the Japanese militarists. International public opinion has also clearly condemned Japan. Where will Matsuoka apply his tricks?</p>

<p>▲ Enemy Retreats to Boats, Almost All Capsized</p>
<p>For days, the enemy has been exerting all its strength, launching fierce attacks on our Zhabei, Jiangwan, Miaohang, and Wusong lines, lasting for dozens of hours. However, they have all been repelled by our troops. Therefore, they changed their strategy. On the night before last (January 29th), they dispatched a large number of warships and aircraft to harass Liuhe and Yanglinkou. At the same time, they also sent thousands of ground troops, using dozens of junks. At dawn yesterday, under the cover of artillery and aircraft, they launched a sneak attack. They were immediately met with a head-on counterattack by our troops. The enemy suffered more than half casualties and retreated in defeat. The following is a compilation of the battlefield situation obtained by this newspaper:</p>
<h3 id="e4">Enemy Warships Cover Ground Troops Landing Yesterday Morning <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>At about 6:00 AM, about twenty enemy warships and more than fifty junks (note: these junks were seized by enemy warships on the river a few days ago) on the sea off Liuhe and Yanglinkou transported enemy soldiers, about two thousand or more. Under the cover of aircraft and artillery, they landed at the mouth. Our military authorities immediately dispatched a large contingent to surround them. The artillery fire from both sides was very fierce. After fierce fighting until about 11:00 AM, the enemy gradually became unsustainable and retreated to the bay.</p>

<p>A special telegram dated the 1st stated that at 2:00 AM on the 1st, Suzhou heard artillery fire all night. It was discovered that nine enemy warships arrived at Yanglinkou on the 29th and started shelling the shore at night. Our garrison initially did not return fire. The shelling became more intense on the morning of the 1st. At about 10:00 AM, we also returned fire with a few shells. At 11:00 AM, the enemy's artillery fire ceased, and the warships also retreated to Shanghai. At the same time, thirty-two enemy aircraft flew in a show of force over the Songjiang, Liuhe, and Yanglinkou area.</p>
<p>A special telegram from Changshu dated the 1st stated that at 4:00 AM this morning, five Japanese warships sailed to Yanglinkou again, attempting to land. They fired more than fifty shells. Our [missing characters] division and Feng Da's Volunteer Army calmly fought back. The sound of artillery fire reached dozens of miles and could be heard throughout the city. At 8:00 AM, the enemy was unable to sustain itself and retreated eastward. The shells all landed in the fields and did not harm anyone.</p>

<p>A special telegram from Suzhou at 9:00 PM stated that at 4:00 PM on the 1st, seven small steamers arrived at the Fuzhou-Taicang border at Floating Bridge, and 700 Japanese soldiers landed and set fires. Our garrison's two companies fought back but were defeated. The Yanglinkou Brigade came to their aid upon hearing the news and routed the enemy. They fled back to their original steamers, but the steamers were trapped in the sand. We opened fire, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties and was almost completely annihilated.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Visitor from Liuhe Reports the Real Situation Yesterday, according to <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>A certain merchant from Liuhe stationed in Shanghai said that a Mr. Zhu took a private car from Shanghai to Liuhe at 9:00 AM yesterday. At Panjiazhai, more than ten miles from Liuhe, he saw more than twenty aircraft in the sky dropping bombs along the way, making it impossible to move forward. He immediately returned to Shanghai. On the way, he met refugees from Liuhe who said that more than thirty Japanese warships were docked on the river surface in the area from the mouth of Liuhe to Yanglinkou. This morning (i.e., the morning of the 1st), Japanese warships fired more than two hundred rounds of artillery at Yanglinkou, destroying many civilian houses. Our defensive forces there firmly held their ground and did not return fire. At the same time, five or six salt boats were seized by Japanese warships, and the salt was thrown into the sea, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers. Under the cover of Japanese warship artillery fire, they attempted to sail into the entrance and land, but were detected by our troops, who immediately opened fire. Seeing that they could not succeed, the ships retreated immediately. The defensive forces there reported to the headquarters, and troops were added to the Liuhe and Yanglinkou area yesterday afternoon to strengthen the defense. It is said that the river mouth in that area is now closed, the sandy beach is far away, and it is difficult for Japanese soldiers to land. However, the aircraft only bombed civilian houses and did not hinder our military defenses in any way.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Bloody Battle of Baziqiao <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Positions Lost and Regained Five Times</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Still Continues This Morning</p>
<p>Large Fire in the Zhabei Area</p>
<p>The enemy forces devoted all their efforts the day before yesterday to fiercely attack Baziqiao in Zhabei, and bloody fighting took place day and night on both sides. Our defense line was lost and regained three times, and the enemy forces suffered over 3,000 casualties. The intensity of the battle was more fierce than those at Caojiaqiao and Jiangwan. It can be said that it was the largest battle since January 28th, and Tiantong'an, Zhuyuan墩, and Xiaochangmiao were the focus of the enemy forces' artillery fire. The artillery fire was still booming incessantly when the reporter escaped from Dachang and returned to the office at noon yesterday. Unexpectedly, after 2:00 PM, the enemy forces regrouped their remaining forces, increased reinforcements, and launched a fourth offensive on Baziqiao to the north and other areas. The intensity of the fierce fighting was even greater than the previous three times. Finally, they were lost and regained five times, and our troops still firmly defended their positions. Here is a recording of the situation from all sides:</p>
<h3 id="e9">The Enemy Attacks Baziqiao for the Fourth Time After two days and one night of hard fighting at Baziqiao, the enemy forces were exhausted by yesterday morning. At about 9:00 AM, enemy reinforcements arrived again, concentrating about three or four thousand men. They resumed utilizing their group artillery and thirty to forty various heavy artillery pieces and a large number of aircraft for cover and launched a fourth intense offensive. As the shells arrived, the houses immediately caught fire, because the enemy forces were using sulfur bombs and shrapnel. None of the bombs dropped by the aircraft were less than a hundred pounds. With the added threat of armored vehicles, the enemy infantry gained the greatest assistance from this and took advantage of the momentum to make a fierce charge. At that time, seeing that the enemy's momentum was too fierce, our troops only offered slight resistance with machine guns to avoid casualties. By about noon at 12:00 PM, our troops retreated about 100 meters to the rear. <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<h3 id="e10">Regaining Lost Ground and Close-Quarters Combat After our troops retreated 100 meters, they immediately mobilized a large number of reinforcements to reinforce the area. By about 1:00 PM in the afternoon, our troops counterattacked for the fourth time, all regarding this place as the key to the entire line. The [missing characters] division commander personally went to the area to command, and the morale of our troops was even more a hundredfold. Everyone was determined to sacrifice themselves. The entire army moved at the same time, with a majority of hand-held machine guns leading the way, fiercely charging towards the enemy's position. The cries of killing shook the distance. At the same time, our army's broadsword teams had rolled into the enemy's ranks, blades flashing, blood and flesh flying. After fierce fighting lasting for one hour and forty minutes, the enemy ranks completely collapsed and fled in disarray. As a result, we still occupied the original position and seized several enemy machine guns, more than 300 rifles, and countless steel helmets and bullets. Afterwards, the enemy continuously bombarded with artillery, without a minute's interruption. By dusk, the enemy took the offensive again, and the attack became even more urgent until this morning, but our army still firmly held the original line without moving. <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<h3 id="e11">Large Fire in Zhabei Again The shells fired by the enemy yesterday fell in the Zhabei area were all sulfur bombs, so a large fire followed every shell. There were three large fires in the Baziqiao area that did not go out all day, but they did not pose a threat to Datong Road and Qiujiang Road. The Jiuru neighborhood of Qiujiang Road has been completely burned down, and Sanduo neighborhood has also been affected. By evening, it had moved towards the western Datong Road area, which also caught fire after being bombed by Japanese aircraft at 3:50 PM in the afternoon, and the fire spread very fiercely. It became even more intense at night, and a bright red glow was visible from a distance. The flames were soaring. As of the time of drafting, the fire was still intensifying. <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>

<p>The Enemy's Artillery Bombardment Never Stops for a Moment</p>
<p>Our Troops Use Enemy Corpses as Barriers to Charge</p>
<p>The main force of the enemy attacked our Baziqiao and along the Zhabei area the day before yesterday and could not move us in the slightest. At dawn yesterday, the Japanese army fiercely attacked Xiaochangmiao Zhuyuan墩. The enemy's artillery and aircraft reconnaissance and intimidation lasted for more than ten hours. Although we advanced and retreated once, our army ultimately repelled the enemy, and the main battle line remained unchanged. The battle situation is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e13">Annihilating the Enemy at Zhuyuan墩 <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The enemy launched a three-pronged attack on Baziqiao Tiantong'an the day before yesterday. Until 10:00 AM yesterday morning, they still attacked Zhuyuan墩 Xiaochangmiao between Miaohang and Jiangwan. The part of the [missing characters] division that was stationed there bravely counterattacked as soon as they saw the enemy coming. After about half an hour of fighting, the enemy sent out two large teams, one heading towards Jiangwan and the other charging at Zhuyuan墩. At the same time, the enemy's artillery shells densely bombarded the same location. It is estimated that nearly 300 shells fell within one sentence, and aircraft dropped bombs in space. The intensity of the fierce fighting was more than the Battle of Caojiaqiao. The battle became even more intense at about 11:00 AM. Our troops defended by the East River of Zhuyuan墩. The enemy troops charged continuously, and our front line once retreated slightly about 200 meters. At that time, the enemy also followed closely, and the momentum became more fierce. At this critical moment, our reinforcements came up and carried out a sneak attack. The enemy had to retreat in a hurry, but it was too late. They were killed by us, reaching more than 200 people.</p>
<h3 id="e14">The Distance of the Fire Line <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The closest distance between the enemy and us on the battle lines of Miaohang Jiangwan Xiaochangmiao Zhuyuan墩 was only more than 20 yards. Rifles were also ineffective. At 10:00 AM, the enemy changed the troops attacking Baziqiao to attack Xiaochangmiao. According to a battalion officer, the most fierce attack by the enemy yesterday was in the section from Miaohang to Zhuyuan墩. At the closest time, both sides used hand grenades to attack, so as soon as they left the trenches, they charged. Although the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, it was ineffective against us.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Using Enemy Corpses as Barriers <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>According to the wounded soldiers transported back by the Guowen News Agency reporter, the enemy left dead bodies at Zhuyuan墩 Miaohang, and our army had repeatedly retreated and advanced several times. When our army attacked, they all used enemy corpses as barriers. There was a fierce war on the line from Jiangwan to Miaohang to the north today. The remaining injured hand retreated, and the cotton clothes were torn by the hand grenade. The war has not stopped as of the present time (4:00 PM).</p>
<h3 id="e16">Battle Situation in Wusong <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>▲ Enemy's Attempt to Cross the Seawall Thwarted</p>
<p>▲ Enemy Warships Use Merchant Ships to Open Fire</p>
<p>▲ Enemy Aircraft Drop Bombs Everywhere</p>
<p>▲ All Have No Damage to Our Army's Position</p>
<p>Yesterday's battle focused on Baziqiao, Zhuyuan墩, and Miaohang. Therefore, the Wusong area was relatively quiet. Apart from an enemy warship using a merchant ship as cover to fire a few shots at the fort in the afternoon, there was no intense gunfire all day. However, starting from 7:00 AM, nine enemy aircraft dropped bombs and destroyed our fort and the Wenzaobang position, but most of them missed, and our army was not damaged at all. The various news about the Wusong area are compiled as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e17">Enemy Aircraft Bombing <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>At about 2:00 AM yesterday, intermittent machine gun and rifle fire was heard between Wusong Fort and the Lion Forest. The artillery fire was very sparse. It was quiet after about forty minutes. According to the investigation yesterday, enemy soldiers sailed to the coast of Xiaoshabei Seawall, northwest of Baoshan City, on small boats, hoping to launch a surprise attack and land but were detected and repelled by our army. At about 7:00 AM yesterday, nine enemy aircraft took off from outside the port and bombed our fort and the Wenzaobang military position. The enemy aircraft hovered in the sky for a long time and dropped more than a dozen bombs in total. Very few exploded, and many fell into the sea. It was not until about 9:00 AM that they were shot down by our anti-aircraft guns. Six aircraft flew back outside the port, and the remaining three flew east.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Enemy Warships Escort Military Supplies <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>At about 11:00 AM yesterday morning, an enemy white tugboat towed two iron-shell barges that were very deep in the water, but no enemy soldiers were seen on board. What was loaded on them seemed to be a large amount of machinery and ammunition and military supplies. It sped quickly into the port from outside Sanjiashui and went to Shanghai. Afterwards, an enemy warship traveled with it for protection. When the enemy warship arrived at Wenzaobang, it opened fire and bombarded our military position, firing a total of five shells. Our army did not return fire. According to the observation of the situation yesterday, the number of enemy soldiers at Zhanghuabang has greatly increased compared to before, and traces of enemy sentries can be found everywhere. Machine gun and rifle fire can be heard from time to time in the Wenzaobang area, which is generally a demonstration by sentries on both sides. At about 12:00 AM, thirteen enemy trucks, fully loaded with a large amount of sacks, were transported from Shanghai to the Zhanghuabang Railway Factory. Also, the mainland reported that, according to news from Zhanghuabang at noon today (the 1st), the Japanese 14th Division is landing at the railway dock there. Infantry, artillery, cavalry, etc., were first disembarked from the transport ship, and then the old headquarters of the 24th Brigade, led by Major General Nittabara, were transported.</p>

<p>At about 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Ningshao Company's Yongxing Wheel of this port, opened to Ningbo from Shanghai, and when it arrived at the mouth of Wusong, a Japanese destroyer followed and tracked it. When Yongxing Wheel was about to arrive in front of the Wusong Battery, the Japanese warship again performed its old trick of stealing and hitting the battery. With the cover of merchant ships, the battery opened four cannons. Since there were merchant ships in our battery, we did not return fire. After the Japanese warship opened fire, it escaped into the Pujiang.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Enemy Soldiers Shipped Again Yesterday <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>A large number of Japanese reinforcements were uniformly sent on the large transport ships such as the Haruna Maru Nagasaki Maru Fengtian Maru at night the day before yesterday, entering the port at night to avoid attention. Until yesterday morning, another 2,000 people were transported to land on Zhang Huabang. By 3:20 in the afternoon, the Nanyang Maru wheel again arrived in Shanghai carrying more than 1,000 Japanese troops, most of whom were in plainclothes, and landed at Zhang Huabang and Huangpu Dock. At about 4:00, the transport ships Haruna Maru Fengtian Maru Nanyang Maru and the 22nd torpedo boat, etc. all sailed out of Wusong at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Mine Explodes Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>▲ Huge Sound North of the Waibaidu Bridge</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Warship Izumo Almost Blown Up</p>
<p>A mine suddenly exploded at the north bank of the Waibaidu Bridge at about 1:00 PM yesterday, and the Japanese flagship Izumo, which was docked there, was almost bombed. The situation is checked and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e22">Docking Location <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Izumo, the flagship of the Third Battle Squadron of the Japanese Navy, has a displacement of 9,800 tons and is the flagship of Vice Admiral Nomura, the naval commander in Shanghai. It is docked in front of the Mitsubishi Wharf along Wuchang Road in Hongkou, that is, in front of the Japanese Consulate on the north bank of the Waibaidu Bridge. After the new commander-in-chief of the Shanghai Japanese Army, General Shirakawa, came to Shanghai, the Japanese Army and Navy Commanders held military meetings and operational plans, etc., on the ship. It is the general machinery for the Japanese army to issue orders.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Mine Bombing <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>At about 1:00 PM yesterday, a mine exploded suddenly in the river outside the Izumo flagship, about four yards away from the ship. The mine was so powerful that it made a loud noise, and the water on the river surface flew up several feet high, and the ground along the Huangpu was shaken. The nearby houses were also shaken. The Izumo ship was shaken and swayed. If the distance was slightly closer, the ship would have been difficult to escape.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Strict Investigation Afterwards <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>After the mine exploded, the Japanese naval officers on the ship were all horrified. At that time, they ran to the deck, and a small motor launch was released by the ship to investigate the surrounding area, but nothing was found. At 1:40, a small launch, carrying two barges, went to Suzhou River from South Huangpu. Passing through the area, it was detained by the Japanese warship and strictly searched. Because nothing was found, it was released.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Foreign Press Records <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Great Beauty Evening News said that today (the 1st) someone attempted to destroy the Japanese Navy Rear Admiral Nomura's flagship Izumo and the Japanese destroyer Oie docked in the Pujiang with a deep-water mine. There were two bombings in total. The first time was at 11:00 in the morning, near the destroyer Oie on the Pudong side. The bombing was very fierce. It was heard that the warship was not seriously damaged except for some damage to the officers' lounge. The second time was at 1:20 PM, and many buildings in the Bund were shaken. According to Rear Admiral Shiozawa speaking to the Great Beauty Evening News representative on the Izumo, the bombing location was about 30 meters from the side of the Izumo. At that time, Vice Admiral Nomura and Lieutenant General Shirakawa, commander of the 11th Division who arrived in Shanghai this morning, were holding talks. According to the Japanese authorities, the Izumo is docked near the Japanese Consulate, and the ship was not damaged. After the incident, Japanese warships in the port immediately lowered small boats to search for it, fearing that there were other mines. They are still engaged in this activity in the afternoon. The Chinese sampans near the bombing site have all been inspected, and two sampan boatmen have been arrested. At that time, the bombing was so violent that it was enough to shake the mountains. Therefore, the Shanghai citizens initially thought it was an earthquake. The dining room and barbecue room of the Cathay Hotel at the Nanjing Road intersection were shaken by the bombing, and the public was horrified. Many Japanese rushed out of the door, thinking that the Tokyo earthquake was seen in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Mayor Wu <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Talks of Peace Are Hopeless</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Use Delaying Tactics</p>
<p>▲ We Are Prepared to Sacrifice</p>
<p>In the past two days, the air of peace has suddenly become noisy again. Peace messages have been sent from Nanjing, Tokyo, and Geneva. The reporter immediately wanted to understand what was going on, so I visited Mayor Wu, who gave the following speech: At a time when the Japanese army is actively increasing its reinforcements, there is an air of peace, which is an absolutely contradictory phenomenon. The origin of this air of peace is nothing more than two paths: one is that friendly countries that care about international peace are making continuous efforts to mediate this Shanghai war; the other is that the Japanese are releasing insincere peace remarks with other purposes, using the air of peace to dazzle international vision and delaying the opening of the League of Nations special meeting. In recent days, radio stations throughout Japan have been heavily promoting that China wants to make peace with them, doing everything possible to cover up. Secondly, their reinforcements have not arrived completely, and those who have arrived are not ready. Use this as a delaying tactic. This is the usual trick of the Japanese. Even friendly countries that are working hard for peace have no certainty about the peace movement under this contradictory phenomenon. Although China loves peace, it will not relax its resistance because of the air of peace. We must prepare everything to make the greatest sacrifice in order to achieve true peace.</p>

<p>The Progress of Peace Negotiations</p>
<p>▲ Gu Weijun's Speech</p>
<p>The mediation of the peace movement by the ministers of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, was still at a standstill yesterday. Our representative, Gu Weijun, and Japanese Navy Nomura held an informal meeting on the British warship Kante, and the Japanese side is now asking the Japanese emperor for instructions on the Shanghai truce principle they have developed. Therefore, whether the formal peace conference can become a reality is still unknown. A reporter from this newspaper visited Mr. Gu Weijun yesterday and asked about the real situation of the peace talks. Mr. Gu replied that the British Naval Commander in Shanghai, Kelly, invited him to the British flagship Kante last Sunday to attend a tea party. When he arrived, the Japanese Naval Commander, Nomura, was also present. Commander Kelly immediately suggested to both parties to try to negotiate a truce. Our side immediately stated that if the Japanese side abandons the demands made on the 18th of last month and puts forward another truce method based on the principles of equality and justice, our side can consider it. The Japanese side indicated that it could not insist, so the possibility of peace talks was discovered. However, the prerequisite was the withdrawal of troops. We insisted on simultaneous withdrawal, and they insisted that our troops withdraw 20 kilometers. After both parties agreed, a truce was based and reported to our government. The peace movement has stopped here, and further development will depend on the sincere decision of the Japanese side.</p>

<p>▲ Oppose the Neutral Zone/Free City Movement</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Groups, Chu Fucheng was publicly elected as chairman. Regarding the unified method for pensions for fallen soldiers, Li Cishan has been dispatched to the Association for the Nurturing of Fallen Soldiers to Safeguard the Nation to discuss everything with Xu Shiying, so as to promote its early realization and comfort the loyal souls. Furthermore, the Association has recently heard that a small number of people are advocating that Shanghai be established as a neutral zone or renamed as a free city. It has been found that free cities are precedents of European countries that have perished. China is an independent country. Whether it is a neutral zone or a free city, it will destroy the integrity of the territory and sovereignty of the Republic of China. If any Chinese participates in this movement, they will be regarded as traitors. The Association vows to oppose it to the death.</p>

<p>Shoot and Kill Red Cross Team Members</p>
<p>▲ Yu Hongzhang's Spirit of Sacrifice Will Not Die</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Soldiers Are Brutal and Devoid of Humanity</p>
<p>The late coal magnate Yu Yingchu from Ningbo opened the Dundacheng Coal Company at No. 63-65 Zhili Road in the Public Concession. For more than a decade, Yu has established branches in major commercial ports. Yu has five sons. The eldest is named Hongkui, the second is Hongfu, the third is Hongsheng, the fourth is Hongjun, and the youngest son is named Hongzhang. He is 22 years old and not yet married. He once studied at Fudan University and is extremely patriotic. Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, Hongzhang has deeply hated the atrocities of the Japanese and repeatedly wanted to join the army, but was stopped by his family. However, his heart of serving the country has never been forgotten for a moment. This time, the war in this city broke out again. Hongzhang immediately organized the Shanghai Coal Industry Association Rescue Team with his coal industry colleagues and personally joined the First Special Team, going to the front line every day to work. The night before, a fierce battle took place at Baziqiao. Our army's position was lost and regained three times. The number of casualties must have been not small. At 8 AM yesterday morning, Hongzhang, together with six members of the 11th Detachment, went to the front line to rescue the wounded soldiers. They got off the car at Dongbaoxing Road and walked. At 10:30 AM, near Xingjiaqiao, they were suddenly seen from the upper floor by Japanese soldiers in the direction of Baziqiao. The enemy aimed with rifles and fired two shots in a row. One bullet hit Yu's chest, and he fell to the ground immediately. Another bullet hit his buttocks, and he bled even more. The people traveling with him quickly put him in the car, which also contained a wounded civilian, and rushed the car to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, because the bullet hit a vital spot, he passed away at 4 PM. At 4:30 PM, the body was taken to the Universal Funeral Home for encoffining. The funeral is scheduled for the 3rd at the National Cemetery. The colleagues of the Coal Association unanimously mourned and lamented that Yu Jun was enthusiastic about patriotism this time and was brutally murdered by the Japanese invaders. Moreover, Yu Jun's family is wealthy, but he was willing to sacrifice so much, which is especially commendable. It is expected that there will be a tragic and grand scene at the public funeral.</p>

<p>Letter of Condolence to the Family of American Pilot Short</p>
<p>▲ Died for Humanitarianism and Justice</p>
<p>▲ His Fame Will Be Immortal Like the Great Men of All Ages</p>
<p>American aviator Mr. Short was flying to Beijing this time and was bombed to death by Japanese aircraft in Suzhou for no reason. The 19th Route Army generals Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, etc., sent a letter of condolence to Mr. Short's parents yesterday. The original text reads: "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Short, On the afternoon of February 23rd at 3 PM, six Japanese robbers' naval aircraft hovered over the sky of Suzhou and dropped bombs on innocent and unarmed civilians. The loss and damage to the lives and property of the people are unprecedented. Your son, Short, flew a Boeing aircraft and fought with the above-mentioned six Japanese aircraft. After ten minutes of machine gun fire, your son unfortunately crashed to the ground and died. When we write this letter, we cannot help but feel regret and respect. It is true that Mr. Short did not shoot down the invading Japanese aircraft, but Mr. Short killed the Japanese pilot leading the attack, so the Japanese aircraft could not do what they wanted and drop bombs at will. No matter how appropriate the words of consolation are, they cannot express our grief and sympathy for your loss. However, we can assure you that Mr. Short's bravery is unparalleled in the world. Mr. Short sacrificed his life so that others could live. Mr. Short sacrificed in armed warfare and for the protection of humanitarianism and civilization. If Mr. Short's death is only for the struggle of China, it would be an underestimation of Mr. Short's brave and humanitarian actions. Because Mr. Short died for humanitarianism and justice, his name will be immortal like the great men of all ages, and his excellent achievements will be remembered by the Chinese people forever. Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and Dai Ji."</p>

<p>The Yangbu Association on Meng Hua Street, Dongqingyuan Road, inside Laoximen, is the headquarters of the 7th Regiment of the Security Team in the Hunan District of Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, a resident of the house across the street, who works in a Japanese foreign company, suddenly had a car carrying many items of luggage, like someone moving to escape a disaster, stop in front of the house. The security team members thought it suspicious that residents of Hunan have been fleeing north to the concessions recently, but now they are moving to the South City. They immediately inspected and found a landmine more than a foot long wrapped in cotton blankets. They immediately detained the people and inspected the house, where they found a huge hole dug inside that would reach the home of a certain lawyer next door.</p>

<p>They immediately arrested the three traitors and learned that the place where the explosive items were manufactured was a small machine shop called Wenbi in Fengde Lane, South Railway Station. They then went to the machine shop with the security team and police to arrest the owner of the machine shop and seized bombs and other items.</p>

<p>▲ After Capturing Her Husband, They Killed Her Son</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (29th), near 6 PM, a local rural woman, about 30 years old, was carrying a bag of clothes and wearing a camel hair cheongsam inside out, with her hair cut off, wearing a purple woolen hat, and a white gauze towel tied on her forehead. She seemed to be suffering from a mental illness, walking north along Zhejiang Road from Dongxinqiao in the Public Concession to Guangdong Road and then turning east, cursing incessantly. She was followed by nearly twenty children and men and women watching the excitement. The ignorant children joked and cursed at her. The woman asked people for the whereabouts of her husband along the way, asking people if they had seen her Ah Ming. People asked who her Ah Ming was, and she replied that he was her husband, who had been captured by the thousand-times-cursed Japanese. Someone then asked her name and where she lived, and why she was in such a state of distress. The woman was mentally confused and initially gave irrelevant answers. Later, she said that she had fled from Jiangwan, near the Jiangwan Racecourse. A few days ago, she and her husband took their four-year-old son and fled, but the thousand-times-cursed Japanese captured her husband on the way, and her son was killed because he was crying. She knelt down and begged for mercy. All the members of her family have been scattered. After saying this, she cried loudly. People asked her name again, but she did not answer, and continued to walk east while crying, calling out her husband's name. Her state was very miserable.</p>

However, it seems that the relief of wounded soldiers is still lacking in agility and bravery. Soldiers wounded in battle, regardless of the severity of their injuries, must be rescued and treated immediately in an extremely rapid manner to reduce the spread and expansion of the injuries. Otherwise, serious injuries will inevitably lead to death, and minor injuries will also become serious. Therefore, based on the past relief situation, it is hoped that the relief personnel will pay special attention to this point.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also replied to General Cai. Because over eighty trade associations such as silk, satin and cotton cloth requested to resume business, and acting on the advice of General Cai of the Nineteenth Route Army to encourage opening the market, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees. They decided to announce the resumption of business on March 1st. Yesterday, shops in the French Concession and the area south of the Suzhou River in the International Settlement reopened one after another. The Sincere, Wing On, and The Sun department stores on Nanjing Road were the first to open at 10 a.m. Although other stores were operating as usual, most of their glass windows and iron canopies had not been removed due to fears of hooliganism. They repeatedly inquired with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce about whether there were any guarantees. According to a responsible person from the association, the Shanghai police authorities stated that they were making earnest preparations to protect the commercial market. Therefore, all businesses could safely operate. The association also replied to General Cai, stating: "Regarding your letter instructing us to encourage the Shanghai business community to open the market as soon as possible, this matter has been submitted to a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees for discussion. Everyone believes that after this military affair, many Shanghai citizens have been displaced. At this time of difficult circumstances, it is especially important to calm people's hearts, reduce unemployment, and regulate finance in order to support the precarious situation and plan for long-term resistance. In response to the requests of various trade associations, it was decided to announce to all merchants and residents of Shanghai that starting from March 1st, all businesses within the safe areas of the city should uniformly resume business."</p>

<p>The War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association previously borrowed a special Jianghua steamer from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for the purpose of sending refugees back to their hometowns. All coal, labor, and food expenses are borne by the association. It is currently docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf and is scheduled to depart tomorrow (3rd) to transport refugees along the Yangtze River.

<p>Petition the Department of Education for Relief of Lost Schooling</p>
<p>The Second Grade Students' Association of the Fishing Department of the Wusong Fisheries School petitioned the Department of Education yesterday to request relief for the loss of schooling due to the destruction of their school by the Japanese pirates' artillery fire during the attack on Songjiang. The original text is recorded below (omitted above). Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Japanese pirates have wreaked havoc throughout Songjiang and Shanghai, especially targeting cultural institutions. The school is located in Songbin, behind the fortress, and is the highest institution in the country for cultivating fisheries talent. In recent years, it has made efforts to promote and frequently strike at the Japanese aggression in China's fisheries industry. Therefore, the Japanese pirates have harbored deep resentment. On the day of the attack on the fortress, the school was the first to be ravaged. All school property, such as buildings, factories, specimens, books, instruments, training boats, and the luggage and belongings of teachers and students stored in the school, were completely destroyed by artillery fire. The loss is estimated to be around a million. Since then, the students have felt at a loss for their studies and their future is uncertain. The school authorities have also stated that recovery is difficult. Therefore, we respectfully submit this to your department, requesting that you quickly provide relief measures for the students or request that the Ministry of Education grant the students the convenience of freely transferring to other fisheries schools. Also, please submit a request to the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to file a serious protest with Japan, demanding compensation for all losses so that it can be restored (omitted below).</p>

<p>Foreign Affairs Committee</p>
<p>Discusses Resumption of Diplomatic Relations with Russia</p>
<p>The Nanjing Foreign Affairs Committee resolved yesterday to fully restore diplomatic relations with Russia, which is considered of utmost importance. There is much speculation here. It is common knowledge that troops are being sent to quell the Manchurian rebels, but the decision to restore Sino-Russian commercial and diplomatic relations is surprising. It should be known that the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia has been rumored among the general population of China for four months, believing that if the world does not help China resist the armed invasion of Japan, China's only path is to join hands with Soviet Russia. China would rather be friends with communism than submit to Japanese military control. It is generally believed here that yesterday's decision by the Foreign Affairs Committee will be adopted by the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee meeting in Luoyang tomorrow. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>The Nanjing Foreign Affairs Committee convened a meeting today to discuss various issues, lasting three hours. After the meeting, someone told the Associated Press reporter that there were three matters discussed today: (1) Restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, (2) Resolution of the Shanghai issue, (3) Suppression of Manchurian independence. Regarding the second item, because Foreign Minister Luo Wengan is still continuing discussions with the British and French ministers, there is no concrete plan yet. However, regarding the second and third points, it is said that the majority of members support the immediate restoration of diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia and the immediate dispatch of troops to suppress the rebels in the Northeast. After the discussion, a draft proposal was drawn up to be submitted to the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang. After this case is passed by the Central Executive Committee, it is expected to instruct Mo Dehui, the Chinese representative to Russia, to conduct consultations on the long-unresolved issues of restoring diplomatic and economic relations on the Middle East route. After the Foreign Affairs Committee adjourned, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan met with French Minister Wilden, holding discussions for a long time. (29th National Press Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>The reaction of the British to the recent developments in Shanghai can be summed up in one sentence: hope mixed with fear. Those in the know have heard the news of peace talks in Geneva and Shanghai, while at the same time hearing the news of the Japanese army preparing to continue its offensive, as if they have fallen into a fog, not knowing what to do. The Times stated that it would be a mistake to view Japan's recent proposal as a bluff, as the strong resistance of the Chinese army has not weakened Japan's determination to use the necessary troops to achieve its goals. If Tokyo is purely thinking about resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute, then the article might say something like this, but Japan has already obtained the cooperation of the powers related to the Far East. All parties should do their utmost to find a solution, and Britain does not want to be in a special leading position in the resolution, but it absolutely does not support Lansbury's cowardly opinion of withdrawing British troops and relocating British expatriates. Lord Cecil wrote to The Times in response to Japan's rebuttal, stating that he cannot cancel the points mentioned in the letter signed by him and many colleagues published in The Times on February 18, because Japan's policy has dealt a major blow to the joint maintenance of peace. This policy has not only sacrificed thousands of lives, but also increased the world's economic difficulties. Political circles in Paris and Washington are all delighted with the development of the Sino-Japanese dispute in Geneva, and especially trust Sir Simon. According to Washington news, Simon has started a truce movement and has telegraphed Secretary of State Stimson several times in the past three days. However, Washington believes that peace is still out of reach, and the Chinese government's decision to suppress the new state of Manchuria is also a major reason. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>The German Germania Central Party newspaper in Berlin commented that Japan's proposal to stop hostilities under certain conditions is indeed a kind of progress. The reason why Japan is now restraining its desires is due to the victory of the Chinese army's resistance and the declaration issued by the Washington government. In addition, the powers' ultimatum requested it to withdraw its headquarters and warships from the public concession, and Japan's financial and financial situation is not good. There is also a sign of resistance to the warlord's actions in the country. All of these are the reasons for Japan's proposal for a truce. Japan originally hoped to take Shanghai in a snap, and then discuss the Manchurian issue with China after the military victory. At that time, Japan's military power would be established, and it would not be worried that China would not succumb, and other powers would no longer insist on dissent. This plan has now fallen through. The Japanese army has been invincible in recent years, and this defeat was something that the Japanese had not expected. Its repeated reinforcements and prolongation of the war were aimed at a lucky victory to restore its military power. Otherwise, Japan's military actions in Shanghai would have stopped long ago. Moreover, the League of Nations Special Assembly will open soon, and Japan's difficulties in coping will be even greater than the previous Executive Yuan. Japan has thought about this thoroughly, so it should be anxious to change its policy. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>In the Lower House today, Undersecretary of State Eden answered the question of Conservative Party member Knox, explaining the financial situation of China and Japan to the League of Nations. He said that as of the end of 1931, China should have paid 14,900,000 gold francs in League of Nations fees, and Japan should have paid 17,200,000 gold francs. Japan has already paid its fees, but China owed 9,700,800 gold francs between 1922 and 1930. The 11th session of the League of Nations decided that this debt would be amortized over 20 years. China has since paid 481,000 gold francs and still owes 9,227,000 gold francs. China should have paid 1,438,000 gold francs in 1931 fees, but only paid 719,000 gold francs, so China owes a total of 9,947,000 gold francs to the League of Nations. Knox asked, "Can a country that owes fees also enjoy the full rights of a member of the League of Nations?" Eden replied, "Yes." (Twenty-ninth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Establishment of the Puppet Regime</p>
<p>▲The Process of Zang Shiyi, Ma Zhanshan, and Zhang Jinghui's Meeting in Shenyang</p>
<p>▲The Organization of the Puppet State Initially Takes Shape</p>
<p>▲All Plans Follow the Will of the Japanese</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The four key figures who gathered in Shenyang, following the will of the Japanese side, convened what they called a "New Country Construction Conference." It was learned that this conference was held at the puppet provincial government at 5 PM on the afternoon of the 16th, after Ma Zhanshan arrived in Shenyang. Zang Shiyi, Zhang Jinghui, Ma Zhanshan, Xi Qia, Yu Chonghan, Yuan Jin'kai, Zhao Xinbo, and others were all in attendance. In accordance with the "New Country Framework" proposed by the Japanese side, they discussed it. Xi Qia advocated for restoration of the monarchy, while Zang Shiyi and Ma Zhanshan advocated for a republic, leading to slight disputes among them. On the 17th, they continued to meet at the puppet provincial government, under the guidance of the Japanese side, to change to two groups for discussion. First, they discussed establishing the highest organ of a unified Northeast political power, severing relations with the Central Government and peace, and forming the blueprint for constructing a new state system. Then, they discussed the second step of the construction outline. On that day, they decided to establish a Northeast Administrative Committee, elect members, and imitate the previous organization of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to complete the highest ruling organ. On the spot, Zang Shiyi was selected as the chairman, but Zang declined, and Zhang Jinghui was promoted to fill the position. In addition to Zang Shiyi, Xi Qia, and Ma Zhanshan, six members were added: Tang Yulin from Rehe, Beile Qimote Semu representing Inner Mongolia, and Ling Sheng representing Hulunbuir. Zhao Xinbo served as the Secretary-General. Regarding the location, Zhang Jinghui, for personal convenience, advocated setting it up in Harbin, Xi Qia advocated setting it up in Jilin, while Zang Shiyi, considering Liaoning as the political center, advocated setting it up in Shenyang. Due to unresolved discussions, it was changed to be discussed after the meeting. On the evening of the 18th, they continued to meet at Zhao Xinbo's residence in the commercial district, deciding to publish the declaration of the establishment of the Northeast Administrative Committee. The wording was quite absurd, the original text stated: "The Northeast Incident has occurred for several months, the people deeply desire governance, like the thirsty yearn for water. At this time of change, the hope for recovery is especially urgent. Jinghui and others have been honored to be elected to lead the provinces and regions, to reform and innovate, which is our inescapable duty. Therefore, we gather our plans in one place. Without the public opinion of the people, we cannot build a new path. Therefore, the four northeastern provinces, special districts, and Mongolian princes and nobles, have organized an organ called the Northeast Administrative Committee. With the establishment of this committee, we are notifying both domestic and foreign parties, and at the same time severing relations with the party-state. The northeastern provinces and regions are completely independent. Furthermore, in the spirit of independence, we will strive to improve administration. In the past, warlord tyrannical rule arbitrarily exacted taxes, and the people lived in misery. The tears of the common people have not yet dried, and the remaining poison of the claws and teeth still exists. We must thoroughly eradicate them and not allow them to sprout again. Those who comfort the people are called marquises, and those who protect the people are called kings. When the four borders are at peace and the people rest, popular rule can be achieved. This is the first mission of this committee. Recently, violent populism has been rampant, accumulating resentment, and social morality is declining daily. Society is the foundation of the nation, and morality is the origin of politics. Loyalty, trustworthiness, sincerity, and respect can be practiced even by barbarians. Without holding a policy of excluding foreigners, international wars will be eliminated. Furthermore, we will use the principles of open door and equal opportunity to coexist and prosper with society and the nation. This is the second mission of this committee. Internal stability and external harmony are the basis of politics. We should strive to consolidate the foundation and promote the prosperity of the branches and leaves. Thus, we will encourage professions and develop commerce, so that those who make profits will increase daily, and those who lose their jobs will decrease daily. As social benefits increase, class struggles will naturally disappear. Communism will not prevail, and people's livelihood can be expected. This is the third mission of this committee. To complete the above three major missions, we have established this committee to seek happiness for the people of the northeastern provinces and regions, and to seek happiness for the people of all ethnic groups in the Northeast. Heaven and the sun are above, witnessing this declaration, hoping that all fellow countrymen and gentlemen will rise up to help us." Zhang Jinghui, Xi Qia, Ma Zhanshan, Zang Shiyi, Tang Yulin, Ling Sheng, Qimote Semu Beile, kowtow. Afterwards, they discussed the establishment of a new country. Xi Qia still insisted on the restoration of the monarchy, arguing with Zang, Ma, and others without reaching a decision. Later, the Japanese side advocated for a vote to decide. As a result, the majority favored a republic. Therefore, in accordance with the Japanese side's "New Country Framework," they discussed and passed each article. The state system was defined as a constitutional republic, and the politics adopted a system of provincial autonomy. The head of state was the Chief Executive, under whom were established the Legislative, State Affairs, Supervisory, and Advisory Councils, as well as eight departments including Civil Affairs. The organization of each department was roughly as follows: Civil Affairs Department established General Affairs, Local Affairs, Police Affairs, Culture and Education, Civil Engineering, and Health Affairs; Foreign Affairs Department established General Affairs, Political Affairs, and Commerce Affairs; Military Affairs Department established General Affairs, Staff Affairs, and Military Affairs; Finance Department established General Affairs, Tax Affairs, and Financial Affairs; Industry Department established General Affairs, Agricultural Affairs, and Industrial and Commercial Affairs; Transportation Department established General Affairs, Railways, Postal Affairs, and Water Transport; Justice Department established General Affairs, Administration, and Legal Affairs. The State Council established a General Affairs Office, Legislative Bureau, Advisory Committee, and Public Security Administration Bureau. The Supervisory Council established Supervisory and Penal Departments. The organization of the court system was divided into the Supreme Court, High Court, District Court, Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, and Chief Prosecutor of the Local Court. After the meeting adjourned on the 18th, Xi Qia and Ma Zhanshan returned to Jilin and Heilongjiang respectively, while Zhang Jinghui remained in Liaoning to establish the Administrative Committee.

<p>All Japanese Nationals Return Home</p>
<p>▲Japanese Military Police Increase Provocations</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people in Wuhan has become increasingly tense. The Japanese concession has also become more heavily guarded. After several provocations by the Japanese, the authorities responded calmly, preventing any incidents from occurring. However, the Japanese remained vigilant and did not show any signs of retreat. In recent days, the Japanese naval landing forces have frequently landed to practice various tactics, and the shouts of killing have continued throughout the night. Japanese nationals are returning home one after another, and it is rumored that they will all be heading east. The head of the Japanese concession police station has also taken leave and left Hankou. At the same time, armaments and explosives have been transported in batches from Shanghai. The general public cannot help but feel alarmed, and rumors are spreading everywhere, causing panic throughout the city. However, it is said that there are only about a thousand Japanese soldiers in Hankou, and the Yangtze River is falling, making warships more practical. Although they may have the intention to provoke, they may not dare to try. The defense of Wuhan is currently very tight. The Hankou and Hanyang areas were initially guarded by Xu Tingyao's troops. Now that Xu's troops have moved north, they have been replaced by Wan Yaohuang's troops. Wan serves as the commander of the Hankou defense zone, with Ye as his deputy. The Wuchang area remains the same, with Ye serving as the chief of the police department and brigade commander, taking on a particularly important responsibility. According to the case report, under this special diplomatic situation, the security is extremely tight, and it will definitely not affect public safety. In the future, we will continue to uphold the principle of not being subdued by unreasonable aggression and not joining in rudeness to respond to the expectations of Chinese and foreign people. If one day Japanese soldiers cross the border to provoke, we will be the first to resist and will do our best to defend our territory. No sacrifice will be considered, and so on. (February 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e135">Guangdong Actively Prepares for National Defense <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲Naval, Land, and Air Defenses Have Been Tightly Arranged</p>
<p>▲Nanhai County Raises Huge Sums to Pre-Store Military Rice</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Guangdong Province is currently rushing to prepare for national defense. In addition to Shantou's coastline being strictly guarded by Li Yangjing leading his troops and a certain independent division, Guangzhou, as the gateway to southern China, should be actively prepared. The Humen and Changzhou fortresses have been reinforced with defensive works and equipped with new heavy artillery. From Humen into the Pearl River basin, up to the suburbs, such as Shougouling, Guanyin Mountain, and Baiyun Mountain, there are tight setups. On the Henan side, which is separated from the provincial capital by a waterway, the situation is also important. Moreover, recently, Japanese people have established several Japanese warehouses in the Zhoutouzui and Fenghuanggang areas near the water on the Henan side. In recent days, local villagers have discovered that the Japanese are using ships to transport heavy items ashore and carry them to Japanese warehouses, usually late at night. Each night, they transport several times, which has attracted outside attention. The authorities are deeply concerned that this secretive behavior of the Japanese may have some kind of purpose. Therefore, they are paying the same attention to the defense of Henan as they are to Hebei (i.e., Guangzhou City). Following the defense measures of Hebei, they have installed many anti-aircraft guns in key traffic locations. Two battalions of the army are drawn from the Second Army and stationed in the Xiaogang area. Anti-aircraft monitoring posts are set up in a certain place in Henan and a certain place in Huangpu. The west is responsible for the Liang Gongfu regiment of the First Teaching Regiment, and the east is responsible for the Chen Hanguang department of the Guard Brigade. Anti-aircraft guns are installed in appropriate locations, and telegraph stations are dispatched to both east and west sides, commanded by Liang's regiment and Chen's brigade, to communicate information at any time. The Pearl River surface is assigned the Zhongshan warship as an air defense monitoring post, and personnel are assigned to specialize in it. The ship is also equipped with anti-aircraft guns. As for aerial patrols, the Air Force Headquarters dispatches planes to Humen at any time to scout for enemy ships outside the port. Along the coast of Guangzhou City, temporary bunkers are built where necessary. Public utilities, such as the electric light plant and the hydro plant, are ordered to have their responsible persons rush to build defensive works to prepare for emergencies. Regarding food reserves, preparations are currently being made. Yesterday, the Nanhai County government initiated the organization of a Food Storage Committee, convened merchants from Foshan, Jiuwang, Guanshan, and other places to discuss the organization of the committee. Ten local business directors were immediately elected as members of the committee, and an office was set up in Foshan to begin work. Regarding raising funds to purchase rice, in addition to borrowing 20% of the capital of all stores in the county, all local public funds will also be borrowed. More than 1.6 million yuan has already been raised, and it is estimated that 7 million yuan will be raised to purchase enough rice for one year. All rice industry shops in the county must purchase rice at twice the amount of their original stock to prepare for thick food storage and to help with national defense. (February 24th)</p>

<p>Expanded Memorial Week</p>
<p>▲Wang Zhaoming Reports Determination to Resist Violent Japan</p>
<p>At 9 AM on the 29th, the Central Party Headquarters and various organs of the National Government held the fourth expanded memorial week in Luoyang. Those in attendance included Wang Zhaoming, Gu Mengyu, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Shao Lizi, Zhu Peide, Lin Sen, Qin Zhen, Zhang Ji, He Yingqin, Chu Minyi, Bai Yunti, Chen Bijun, Feng Yuxiang, Shi Qingyang, Guo Chuntao, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Yu Zhongzhen, Duan Xipeng, Xiao Jishan, Miao Bin, Cheng Tianfang, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Zhaoying, Yang Jie, Li Ciwen, Ding Weifen, Gong Ludong, Dai Kuisheng, Ke Xinge, Li Zonghuang, Wang Qi, Yu Jingtang, Shi Ying, Wang Faqin, Li Liejun, Deng Feihuang, Shen Yunchao, Zheng Zhannan, Zeng Yangfu, Zhou Qigang, Wang Maogong, Huang Shaogu, Wang Boling, Huang Jichen, Miao Peicheng, Ding Chaowu, Xie Zuomin, Zhou Fo Hai etc., as well as nearly a thousand representatives from the central organs and local groups. After Ju Zheng, as chairman, led the ceremony, Wang Zhaoming reported, briefly stating, "Brothers, today I will give a summary report on the military and diplomatic aspects of what I have experienced traveling between the Jinpu and Longhai Railways over the past month. Since the Japanese army attacked Shanghai on the 28th of last month, it has been a month. Our Shanghai garrison has resisted the Japanese with all their might for a month. This resistance has two important meanings: (1) Last year, on September 18th, the Japanese army sent troops to the Northeast and occupied Liaoning and Jilin provinces within 24 hours. This was the result of non-resistance. This time, our army in Shanghai resisted with all their might and did not lose an inch of land after 30 days of hard fighting. This fact is a refutation of the doctrine of non-resistance. Resistance means not losing an inch of land after 30 days, while non-resistance means losing two provinces in 24 hours. This is a major lesson at the critical juncture of national survival. Therefore, the 30-day resistance in Shanghai shows that even if China can be destroyed, it will not be destroyed without bloodshed. This is a profound lesson for Japan. (2) In terms of diplomacy, although countries previously spoke of fairness to us, they were very cold. The biggest reason was that China itself did not resist. Since the resistance in Shanghai, world opinion has changed immediately, and the attitudes of various countries have been better than before. On the 30th of last month, the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France took on the task of mediation. One point in the proposed conditions was very important.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>That is, in the Sino-Japanese negotiations, there can be no preconditions whatsoever. This was aimed at the five basic principles of negotiation previously proposed by Japan as preconditions. Therefore, we accepted the mediation of the three countries, but Japan refused to accept it. Later, the three countries proposed a second mediation, requesting a ceasefire in Shanghai first and then resolving the Northeast issue. We clearly know that the Shanghai issue and the Northeast issue cannot be separated. Therefore, our reply was that if resolving the Shanghai issue is the first step in resolving the Northeast issue, then China can accept it. However, the Japanese side not only did not reply but suddenly issued an ultimatum to the mayor of Shanghai. Regarding this matter, I have already sent a telegram on the 20th of this month. Japan's unreasonable demands even include the stipulation that the Wusong Fortress cannot be re-equipped, which is directly comparable to the example of the powers imposing on Dagu Fortress in the Boxer Protocol. Therefore, China naturally cannot accept it, and Japan did not even wait for a reply before attacking again. After this, the opinions of various countries all blamed Japan. Now, three days later, the League of Nations will hold a special meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue. We hope that when the League of Nations holds the general meeting, it can invoke Article 16 of the Covenant and impose economic sanctions on Japan. Although it is not certain that it will pass, we must resist and then we can attract international attention. From this, we can see that the resistance in Shanghai has given Japan a serious lesson, making it know that it is not easy to destroy China. On the other hand, it is increasing the credibility of China in the eyes of various countries. In addition, there is another important point, which is to raise national consciousness. This time, not only the troops are determined to die, but also the residents of Shanghai are not concerned about losing their homes or lives. They are even more brave in donating and helping the soldiers on the front lines. Even people outside the party are unanimously supporting the government, and the unity of comrades within the party goes without saying. This is the revival of national consciousness. Although I dare not say that this is an opportunity for the revival of our nation, at least it can be seen that our national consciousness is still good. Even if we are conquered, it will be a bloody conquest. As for the government's support for the Shanghai garrison, there is already factual evidence. In the future, if Japan continues to increase its troops, we will continue to increase our support. The responsibility for expanding this war rests with Japan. Now, people generally have two different views. Some people believe that given China's current financial and military strength, it is impossible to fight Japan. Some people believe that China is bound to win against Japan. Although they seem contradictory, both have truth in them. Because, according to ordinary warfare, China's military and financial strength certainly cannot defeat Japan. However, a suppressed nation resisting imperialist aggression is fighting a desperate battle with the full strength of its entire nation. Therefore, the standard of victory or defeat cannot be based on a comparison of ordinary warfare. This depends entirely on whether the nation wants to be conquered or not. The words of breaking off diplomatic relations and declaring war should not be spoken now, because Japan is invading, but it has not yet openly declared war. We are acting in legitimate defense, so there is no need to talk about declaring war. We must be tragic but not exaggerate. Exaggeration is deceiving oneself, while tragedy is the determination to resist with all our might. For the sake of national survival, we should resist and must resist. Internally, we can raise the consciousness of the Chinese nation; externally, we can restrain Japan's ambitions and increase China's credibility in the international community. This is a critical juncture for China's survival, and it is also our only way out."</p>

<p>Methods for Patriotic Martyrs</p>
<p>"Killing oneself to achieve benevolence and sacrificing one's life to take righteousness" are the true spirit of our country's nation-building for thousands of years, which can never be erased in the slightest. This time, the soldiers of the 19th Route Army and various volunteer armies have been loyal and courageous in defending the country and killing enemies. The momentum has become more and more fierce, the atmosphere of the invaders has been frustrated, and the country's reputation has increased. All of this is due to the martyrs' protection of the country's every inch of land and their great fearless spirit of not fearing death or caring for their own lives, sacrificing boundless loyal blood to achieve this. The people of the country should immediately plan ways to revere and methods to comfort these respectable, lovable, and worshipable martyrs, so that they can comfort the loyal souls and manifest their righteousness. Therefore, I will record and present my humble opinions on the left:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding matters that should be handled for reverence, the Shanghai community should immediately initiate a request to the central government to approve the establishment of a Zhaozhong Shrine in each province and city, dedicated to enshrining the martyrs who died defending the country this time, and stipulate January 28th as the anniversary of our country's resistance to violent Japan. On the due date, the whole country should unite in suspending business and paying respect to show reverence and encourage loyalty. So that our country's nation-building spirit of "killing oneself to achieve benevolence and sacrificing one's life to take righteousness" can be maintained without decay. This is one thing that the people of the country should immediately proceed with.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding matters that should be handled for comfort, the Shanghai community should immediately initiate a request to the central government to approve the division of an area in the capital and each province and city to build residences dedicated to the families of martyrs to live in, named "Martyrs' Village." All families of martyrs can request to live in them at any time, free of all expenses. Their children can enter schools, whether they are universities, middle schools, or elementary schools, and the government should grant them special permission for free tuition. The alimony for their orphans can be raised by each province and city, included in the budget, and used as legitimate expenses. This is the second thing that the people of the country should immediately proceed with.</p>
<p>In summary, the loyal and courageous killing of enemies by the 19th Route Army and various volunteer armies this time is truly the restoration of a new life for our country in the world and opens a new era in our country's history. It is also sufficient to show that our nation is a resolute and compassionate nation that upholds public reason and justice, loves peace, and sincerely believes in humanity, and is by no means comparable to the barbaric, cruel, and inhuman warlords of violent Japan. If the world does not perish, public reason will surely prosper. The people of our country should know more about how to strive for self-improvement. (Zhenyi)</p>

<p>Congratulate Japanese Army's Defeat</p>
<p>▲Special Meeting on March 3rd Feared to be Unfavorable to Japan</p>
<p>▲Matsudaira, Nagano, and Matsui Strive to Smooth Things Over</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun received a telegram from Geneva by special correspondent Okuma, stating that since the Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai, representatives from various countries in Geneva, as well as people from small countries, have repeatedly heard news of the Japanese army's defeat, and they have all been ecstatic. Whenever they meet Chinese people, they shake hands to congratulate them on their victory. Among them, hundreds of reporters from various countries, due to their lack of understanding of Chinese affairs, all deeply believe that the Japanese army was defeated. Representatives from small countries who have harbored suspicions were particularly delighted upon hearing the news of Japan's defeat. Some representatives also slandered the Japanese military, making excuses to increase troops, expanding the war in every way possible, sparing no effort. They also said that the League of Nations General Assembly on March 3rd is approaching, and although Japan is sending large reinforcements in an attempt to drive out the Chinese army before the meeting, the League of Nations leadership has long regarded the Shanghai Incident as a major issue since the League of Nations convened. Japan should understand the will of the League of Nations and take care of the League of Nations' face. If military action continues until the convocation of the temporary general assembly, the meeting on March 3rd is feared to be greatly unfavorable to Japan. Therefore, the Japanese plenipotentiary representative in Geneva, in view of the unfavorable future situation, especially invited foreign reporters on the 25th by Ambassador Matsudaira and Lieutenant Generals Nagano and Matsui to strive to smooth things over.</p>

<p>Announces Airplane Sacrifice</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun carried a war message released by the Japanese Ministry of the Navy, stating that after the naval aircraft of the Third Fleet bombed Wusong Town, when it was about to return to the ship for recovery, it suddenly overturned, and the fuselage was badly damaged. Lieutenant Kimura Kenji was injured, and Aviation Petty Officer Izutake Hajime died. In addition, the fighter plane of the flight team that departed to bomb the Nanxiang Station the other day, which was piloted by Petty Officer Ariga, suddenly went missing. After the flight team searched everywhere, there was no trace of it. This was the first sacrifice of a military aircraft.</p>
