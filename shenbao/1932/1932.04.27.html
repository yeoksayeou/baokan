<h3 id="c1">軍縮會議之前途翰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>軍縮爲國聯之主要任務。載於國聯之最高憲章。乃軍縮正式大會。幾經挫折。於聨盟成立已届十二年後之最近。始見召集。今復以種種關係暫告停頓豈眞如意外相格蘭第所謂。［軍器爲人類長時間心血之結晶。廢棄尚須有待］耶。</p>
<p>昔俾斯麥嘗預言。［一八七○年之普法戰爭。自後人視之殆兒童之嬉戲］果也。一九一四年之大戰對於物質與精神之破壞。至今猶令歐人永留沈痛悲慘之印象苟一言及未來大戰之恐佈。則更談虎色變與前次大戰較恐更將視爲兒童之嬉戲矣。是故歐洲非戰之心理。深入一般平民之腦。中歐洲人士。無論男女老幼。莫不厭戰。惜乎列國政府。對於國防之預算。仍遠超一般行政費之。上坐使國家財政無法均衡。益以經濟制度之紊亂國際關係之複雜。恐未來之殺機仍方興而未艾。</p>
<p>此次軍縮會議之召集適値世界經濟恐慌。臻於尖銳之程度而日本侵略中國。又正在極力進行之時期。當時上海之槍砲聲。適與日内瓦之介導和平</p>
<p>。聲成極端之矛盾軍縮會議事前雖有五年籌備之公約草案。而各國代表仍</p>
<p>雄辯滔滔。經長時期之討論。而論的猶未及軍縮之本題列强間鈎心鬥角。殆皆欲自國之軍備。處於優越之地位。他國之軍備實行眞正之减縮。法國以安全保障爲軍縮之先决問題。其目的在遏止德國之复仇永握歐陸之覇權。德國期實行軍縮。須以平等徒遇爲原則。其目的在脫離凡爾塞和約之拘朿。重振德國之軍備。意國認惟有軍縮始爲安全保障之基礎。與法國之主張針鋒相對。目的在擊破法國政策之诡辯英國希望軍縮大會爲倫郭海軍協約之擴大。目的在防止美國勢力之澎漲美國以减輕戰債爲實行軍縮之交换條件。目的在打開世界經濟之僵局。再造美國金圓之繁榮蘇聯主張澈底裁軍。以誇大之詞。揭穿軍縮之假面具目的在維持五年計劃之進行避免外界勢力之侵擾。至日本自始即無裁軍之誠意。以袒護法國之主張結好於。法俾對華侵略。可以進行無阻。列强斤斤於一般問題之討論。其所着眼者。非爲軍縮。也爲欲借軍縮以運用外交之工具而已。</p>
<p>至於最近各國主張在表面上似已漸漸納入問題之本身所謂侵略戰器之限制。猛烈戰具之廢除。經英外相西門提出以後。雖經法國猛烈之反對。仍得多數之同意。此後討論之焦點。將集中於軍縮之技術問題。而列强之鈎心鬥角。將益臻於繁複細密使吾人不諳軍事學及戰器技術者。墜入五里霧中。究其　結。列强無非欲籍技術問題之精密計算爭得自國軍備之優越地位而已。軍縮云何哉。</p>
<p>且也列强間之利害衝突。自日本積極侵略吾國以來。愈益明顯。太平洋上有日俄美之三角爭鬥。歐陸有德法意之暗爭。賠償問題戰債問題等等。皆懸而莫决。多腦河經濟同盟之議。障礙孔多。而國際聯盟對于中日之爭議。種種曲折。顯已喪失其權威。最近史汀生赴歐樂觀派且認爲與大戰後威爾遜赴歐有同等之重要。詎料各方接洽。絕鮮成效。凡此皆足以襯出國際背景之日益慘淡。愈顯軍縮前途之悲觀也。</p>
<p>總之軍縮前途。不擊於會議形式上的結果。全視國際形勢爲轉移。今日國</p>
<p>際形勢之險惡在在皆足以證明軍縮之無望。吾人惟有引法外交家彭古之語以證明之日。［軍縮會議一旦失財則世界之危機。將日益擴大。非至爆發不止也。］</p>

<p>小國代表懷疑英使新方案</p>
<p>一致反對變更决議案原文</p>
<p>颜惠慶宣布日在東省企圖</p>
<p>路透社二十六日日内瓦電云、國聯十九國特委會、今日在此開會、討論中日爭案、會議匪特不公開、且異常秘密、</p>
<p>國民社二十五日日内瓦電云、國聯大會十九國委員會主席希孟、已於今日發出通知書、定二十六日下午三時三十分舉行秘密會議、在日本拒絕决議案草案之形勢下、考慮上海時局、聞英公使藍溥森已將日人所提折衷辦法、轉達日内瓦、主張修改草案内第四項、授權混合委員</p>
<p>會、遇撤兵辦法上有怠忽或缺乏進步時、報告國聯、而删去草案第十一項、但中國代表反對若斯减削混合委員會之權力、致不克以大多數同意表决撤兵期、日代表松平今日又訪美國務卿史汀生、陳述日本對於滿洲與上海事件之態度、國聯今日發表四月二十一日中國所送照會全文長十二頁、宣稱、滿洲傀儡改府爲日本野心之暴露、並追維美國及國聯各會員國保證不承認滿洲政治地位違犯條約或盟約而遇成之任何變更、宣稱日本故意破壞中國滿洲地方領土、與政治之完整、並駐六萬大軍於其地、</p>
<p>路透社二十五日日内瓦電云、十九國特委會、將於明日重開議、是項决定、係今日各小國代表非正式討論之結果、南美諸邦及希臘西班牙等國代表、因外間有解决上海事件新方案之傳聞、均表示不安、蓋恐造成先例、致日後各小國如遇國際纠纷、將處於不利地位也、外傳英使藍溥森及日使重光葵、曾擬定新方案、對於上海協定草約第四項、擬加補充、使</p>
<p>混合委員會不特視察日軍撤退之進行、且於中日任何一方如有漢視或不遵照合理建議時、負報告之責任、惟此傳聞、未能證實、故此間謠諑繁興、數多揣測之</p>
<p>词、衆認上述方案之弱點、乃混合委員會之决議、是否應全體一致或以多數能過、即可生效、中國代表團爲籌備應付明日之十九國特委會起見、發表一篇長文、叙述日本在東省之企圖、並舉日本自日骮戰爭後、於各重要國際會議中之舉動、作爲引證、</p>
<p>國民社二十五日日内瓦電訊云、十九國委員會内大多數小國之代表、由西班牙代表馬達利亞加領袖、今日非正式集</p>
<p>會、討論十九國委員會公開會議中、倘各大國對於委員會議决案提出新解釋、俾該案較易爲日本接收時、各小國應取之一致態度、現各小國議决之態度、尚未發表、但表示反對放寛决議案原有解釋之範圍、與减輕其分量、</p>
<p>國民社二十五日日内瓦電云、國聯大會十九國委員會内各小國、已决定反對更改决議案原文或其解釋、但聞各大國代表連日私人談話中、連美國務卿史汀生在内、大半係考慮十九國委員會决議案能否加以更寛泛之解釋、以免造成嚴重之危局、國聯總秘書德魯蒙對於此事</p>
<p>最爲活動、今日又開午宴、其上賓中有十九國委員會之委員數人、英相麥唐納亦在座、</p>
<p>路透社二十六日倫敦雲云、駐華英使藍溥森修正之中日休戰新方案、已由國民政府在原則上接受、此項消息、今日已在倫敦徴實、衆意此新方案、可望由日政府接受、</p>
<p>路透社二十六日東京電云、今日據外省負責人稱、駐華英使藍溥森之提議、如提交上海和平會議、而非在日内瓦提出、則可得優惠之考慮、蓋日本堅持遵守三月四日國聯决議案下之手續、而不能承認根據三月十四日决議案而成立之十九國特委會法律上地位也、聞南京有依允藍公使方案之說、果爾、則日政府希望上海談判不久即可復開、而締結休戰協定云</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社會二十五日倫敦電云、西門外相對於上海中日談判之僵局、發表宣言、略謂主要困難、在日本軍隊撤退時期、此項問題由十九委員會從事調查、在該會未有决議以前、不能作任何有益之報告、</p>

<p>郭泰祺藍溥森昨返滬</p>
<p>今晨先開起草委員會</p>
<p>郭使英間題聞已打銷</p>
<p>外交次長郭泰祺及英公使藍溥森在京、與行政院長汪精衛·外交部長羅文幹·及軍事委員會長蔣介石·面洽上海停戰問題、茲以英藍使所提出之折中辦法業經我政府當局接受、郭次長及英藍使、因於</p>
<p>昨晨十時三十分、乘蔣介石自備之福特飛機返滬、十九路軍參謀長黄强、亦同機返滬、英藍使並即於下午三時、赴日總領事館、訪日使重光葵、密談一小時而去、英藍使僕僕京滬、斡旋和平、今以國聯議會特别委員會秘密會議所通過之决議案第十一條、規定日軍最後撤退日期、由上海共同委員會、到期、經任何一造動議開會、以大多數通過决定一節、日本表示反對、國聯方面、旣成僵局、及此間停戰會議因亦無從重開、英使遂向我政府當局、另提折中辦法、據外交界消息、英使所提折中辦法、衹將今次國聯决議案第十一條、加以字句上之修正、使視原文較爲温和、惟於本義並無多大變更、至於大多數通過或全體同意通過等字句、則已删去、蓋此間歷次會議所議定停戰協定草案關於共同委員會辦事細則之附件已有此種規定、無須國聯决議案重複决定也、我政府對英使折中辦法、旣已表示接受、</p>
<p>日本對此、聞亦不致反對、日内瓦方面、可望因此打開僵局、此間停戰會議重開形勢、遂成爲遲早問題</p>
<p>至於此間停戰會議究竟何日重開、郭次長昨日返滬、表示仍須俟國聯方面通過决議案後、方能確定開會日期、我方方針、對於此點、初無變更也、更據外交界預測、國聯議會特别委員會、昨夜會議、可望通過决議案、則今日日内瓦方面、當有報告遞到、明後日、此間或有根據國聯决議案即行重開停戰會議之可能、蓋各方均已準備、祗徒日内瓦方面之發展</p>
<p>而已、</p>

<p>對於停戰會議有關之郭泰祺調任駐英公使問題、本報曾謂、此事有某種政治背景、郭於使英、恐未必就、郭次長最近入京、於此事原有一部分關係、郭氏今返滬、對使英問題、仍無具體表示、祗謂、時機尚遠、茲更據熟悉内幕者言、郭氏入京之結果、此事或已無形打銷矣云、</p>

<p>倭寇滬凟。中外共憤。我十九路軍與之抵抗。歷時一月之久。殲敵二萬之衆。爲我國提高國際地位。爭求民族生存。尤爲朝野上下所共仰。該軍一五五旅旅長黄固。精良强幹。運籌幃幄。往往出奇制勝。茲紀該旅軼事數則如後。以見我軍此次抗日之一斑。</p>
<p>士兵勸習打靶子自九一八事變發生後。人心皇皇。舉國鼎沸。該旅士卒。亦皆憤激異常。旅長黄固。每値公餘之暇。其所部。宣講東省被陷之事實。並揭穿日人圖滿之野心。士卒聞之。莫不怒髮衝冠。抱破釜沈舟之志。冀與一决生死。平時操練。遂益加勤奮。尤注重打靶一道。其打靶也。先在靶上繪一人形。上書日本人三字。於是即瞄準此目標打去。一聲打中。則咸喜形於色。人心大快。且或致慶賀之辭。或呼抗日之口號焉。</p>
<p>飯孟菜碟退敵人敵人作戰。恃其軍械之精良。向我進攻其猛。但其大部士卒。以平日之養尊處優。毫無作戰經騐。故臨陣退即却者。大有其人。二月二十五日傍晚。敵三十餘向我陣地來窺。該處我軍。僅有一五五旅兵士三名。正據壕進食、瞥見日軍前進。不及舉槍射繫。隨取飯孟菜碟。向遠擲去。詎敵兵胆小如　。以爲手溜彈從天而降。急棄甲曳兵而走。我亦舍而不追。惟相與拊掌而已。</p>
<p>班長隻身奪新槍二月念五日竹園墩之役。敵方有連珠射來。其聲異常。爲前所未聞。該旅第二團班長陳友之。久列戎行。能征慣戰。料爲敵之最新式利械。欲得之而甘心。時該團第五連亦欲奪此新式之殺人利器。奮勇衝進。因以犧牲不少。入夜該班長乘夜色迷濛之下。獨由側面蛇行而進。深入敵陣。敵槍手數人。方入睡鄉。遂一一殺而死之。奪槍而返。後據敵俘虜云。此槍名鐵兜機關槍。係日本最近發明。輕便犀利。非他種槍械所能望其項背。此乃初次使用於戰場云。</p>

<p>那知京在這一天的半夜裏。寨外人馬沸騰。竟開到了一營剿匪軍隊。呌開寨門。便進來搜捕匪首牛黑風。安大成向那帶隊的營長一打聽。郤還是安大奎呌他們來的。因爲軍署裏捉拿牛黑風。賞格懸得很重。安大奎久想高陞做實職的帶兵官。苦無機會。便不惜賣友求榮。向駐防司令部告密。他另還帶了一營隊伍。在後面打接應呢。初以爲牛黑風進了他安家寨。至少總得住上一夜。那還不是鹽中之鳖。由他手到擒來。送上去邀功嗎。不想牛黑風没上這個當。竟使他撲了一個空。安大成聽了。并還大大的不滿意。只駡他作事荒唐。不留後步。事前絲毫没有個商量。就胡亂去請兵。幸虧是牛黑風已走了。没曾兩方衝突上。若眞個衝突開來。就算他捉冷剌能將牛黑風擒住。達到陞官發財的目的。但牛黑風在未就擒之先。郤先饒我不得。好好的安家寨。就會整個兒壞在他手裏。先遭池魚之殃了。安大奎捉牛黑風不著。又聽說安大成在責備他。就未回寨來。悄悄收兵回去。更不料牛黑風耳目靈通。四下裏所派的暗探。早迭連將這些事火速報告與牛黑風知道。牛黑風一聽。不由三尸神暴跳。七　火生烟。以爲安家弟兄。竟這樣的不夠朋友。他旣不仁。我便不義。登時集合起匪衆六七百人。趁官兵剛走不遠。就一回馬槍仍復殺到安家寨來。安大成情知不妙。但以爲終有辯白餘地。仍吩咐團了打開寨門延入。郤不想牛黑風此時心懷怨毒。已是翻臉不再認人。在寨門外大喝一聲。先將安大成拿下。隨後一窩蜂殺進寨來。不分靑紅皂白。逢人便殺。見房便燒。可憐安大成受了他兄弟的連累。一句話都没來得及說。就死於匪衆亂槍之下。回頭住宅一著了火。安大奶奶和家下人等。也都焦頭爛額。死於非命。只有一個忠勇的長工在危急時反把安玉源抱到屋後白菜地害子裏藏　著。　免於難。</p>

<p>昨見報載、據瀋陽消息、［溥儀在長春被剌、未中要害、原因係拒簽日滿新條約、致受日閥警告一這個消息、是否確　、雖尚不得而知、假定此說而果確的話、有人謂是溥儀的僥倖、我說是溥儀的大不倖、</p>
<p>據有人說、溥儀的頭腦、尚屬清楚、喜看書、頗有新思想、這次東北串了一齣新把戲、一方爲日人所刧持、一方爲一般狐羣狗黨做復辟的夢所造成、這種話我不全信、或者也有一部分理由、果然如此、漙儀在長春竟被剌死、到是溥儀良心未昧的一個絕好證據、我們大家可以原諒他、和悲悼他、</p>
<p>若未被剌死、到是使他活受罪、名目是執政、而其實一絲一毫没有主權、完全是一個傀儡、這樣的執政、與拘禁有什麽分别呢？再拿我國全部歷史打開來看看、自古失國的君主、有一個生全的麽？而滿清遜國、非但不加戕害、還要給他皇室優待經費、一年數百萬元、現在因爲國家政費竭蹶的缘故、所以把此欵取消、但是民國之待溥儀、眞可謂仁至義盡、溥儀回過頭來想想、也應感激涕淋了、</p>

<p>玻璃陶小桃</p>
<p>玻璃對於人類是非常的有用，小可以助人看到肉眼所不能看到的微生物，遠可以助人研究一萬萬光年外之星宿。每光年等於六萬萬萬英哩，因爲光線在一年的時間行六萬萬萬英哩，玻璃做的天文镜可以令人看到六萬萬萬萬萬英哩之外的星，再說得平常些，玻璃做的窗户可以容許光明進房，却不許蒼蠅進來搗亂，這是多麽奇妙的發明啊！那日常用的燈罩，瓶子，杯子的效用也不消說了，玻璃的功用旣然是這麽大，我們對於牠的歷史，製造，何能不知道呢？</p>
<p>在好幾千年前，埃及人早已會做玻璃了，不過他們做的玻璃不大好，比現</p>
<p>在的黑玻璃瓶還要不能透明，到了十五世紀時，歐洲斐尼士人就會造透明的玻</p>
<p>璃了，不過僅爲少數貴族造裝飾品，價値簡直比金子還貴重，</p>
<p>牠的製造法普通的以石灰石，炭酸鈉，石英砂（又名二氧化　）混合後放在　中燒，大約燒到攝氏表２００的時候，這混合物就溶化了，成爲透明的液體，冷則成爲固體即玻璃。在成液體時，用一長約五尺的吹管，蘸了一丝，用嘴一吹即成一圓形，把吹管和所吹成的玻璃品截斷，即放在温室中讓牠漸漸的冷才能很堅固，如使牠忽然冷下來，則很容易破裂，如果我們要吹成各種式樣的瓶子，則非有模子不行，將吹管蘸一點玻璃液體放在模子中，一吹便可以吹出和模子一樣的東西來，普通做化學器械的玻璃中間是放了鉀鹽的，做出的玻璃性堅硬，稱之爲硬玻璃，放納鹽製成的玻璃性軟些稱之爲軟玻璃，可以製門窗上的玻璃，用氧化鉛代替石炭石製成的玻璃軟而折光度大可估光學儀器，如透鏡等，玻璃窗上的玻璃是將玻璃液體吹成長形的圓筒，中間切開再把牠弄平而成功的，從模中出來的玻璃品極不光滑，但可以隨意修飾，中國玻璃業已漸漸發達，山東的濟南，上海的閘北都有小規模的玻璃廠，就近去參觀一番，是很能長見識的，</p>

<p>慘遇號鶯</p>
<p>有一小隊難民在滬西某一條馬路上缓缓地走動着，在人潮裏，他們是被視作次人類的一種動物的，</p>
<p>他們走過中山橋，折回西北，漸漸地背離起塵囂的上海，經過了第一個鄉村時，他們嗅到了新春的氣息，望見了靑色的植物，這一下使他們感到了似乎從高壓的空氣裏脫離出來的舒適，於是，他們加緊了脚步，</p>
<p>的確，他們連一元錢一輛的獨輪車也唤不起，準備用二條腿來走完這五十多里的長途，這樣所以他們必得利用休息來恢復疲勞，</p>
<p>走過了鐵路，開始碰見羣羣向上海逃來的農民，問或有一二個同鄉夾在裏面，彼此就站住了攀談幾句，比較親近的人，那就勸告他們打回頭，用着恐怖的語調，叙述着一二件新鮮的事，末後他們便加上一句···［回到地獄，你們？］</p>
<p>内有一個勤儉的中年農夫，擒着涙喃喃的回答他們：［有什麽法想，收容所一樣是地獄，還是到自已村裏去死罷，</p>
<p>這是一個荒僻的獨家村，村子上除了幾隻吱吱呌着的烏雀外，連一條活的狗也找不到，破牆上有二三條日本標語，脫去了角在風裏吹，屋子雖還存在，但屋子裏再也没有一件完整的東西，滿服都是凌亂的稻草，破衣，以及毁了的門窗和家具，</p>
<p>現在，他們是陷在絕望的深崖裏了，隠隠地從遠處有人聲近來，他們聽得十分清楚，這是一種非常的聲息，各人都驚駭的站了起來，偷偷地奔到塲外，突然在村子的收獲塲的東角上，出現了三個並非我國的兵士，這驚人的發現，使他們失去了知覺，</p>
<p>一陣獰笑夾着一串［吉葛吉葛］的話，起初他們拍拍女人的肩膀，用槍柄敲敲女人的小脚，接着，他們做着手勢，要他們一齊脫去衣服，他們擎着顫抖的手作揖，但這是不生效力的，</p>
<p>最後，他們把兩個幾乎在氣忿和恐怖中死去的男子，牢牢捆住，逐個的抛到收獲塲上，然後，他們各人拖着一個女人走進屋中，</p>
<p>太陽在西天發出最後一線的光燄時，那三個獸行的人走了，他們方才掙扎出來，</p>
<p>如此，他們又决定了明天再走的計劃，一切羞辱忿怒恐怖的情緒，都化作了泪水，</p>

<p>官宦之家吾</p>
<p>我今天所以跑到黎太太家裏去，不過僅是以友人的關係去討望而已。當我剛走進門，便聽到熱閙的牌聲，我想：［今天到來得凑巧，否則又是要</p>
<p>我補上一個，當他們是［三缺一］的時候，然而今天已是人</p>
<p>馬齊全，該不會要我送給她們的纸烟錢了。］果然，當渺小的我在她面前出現的時候，她只是似乎抱歉的在說：</p>
<p>［對不起，我們又在打牌···荷花······拿烟給客人吃！｝</p>
<p>接着是妙齡的丫頭奉上茶烟。</p>
<p>没有多久，牌已宣告結束。黎太太的牌風眞好，面前整整的是一堆銅板還有幾元光洋。她剛一起身，便招呼我到她的［大烟間］去。一個丫頭早已在一旁燒好了烟在等她，於是她懶懶地躺下去。打了一個呵欠後，微露着烏黑的牙齒並帶笑容的說：</p>
<p>［今天我眞請着了财神］，打［花會］打中了，剛剛打牌又　了好些銅板。］</p>
<p>好運氣，好運氣！·····［今天花會出了什麽？］我凑趣的問着，因爲這確能使她非常高興。</p>
<p>［我昨晚夢見不打仗了，今天居然出了［太平］，你說這不眞是奇怪嗎？］　　［啊！黎太太的夢眞的靈騐，幾時我也要托托福，跟着你打幾個銅板。］　　我猜得準，這使她非常中聽，但是好她來不及笑，因爲她已吮着那粗大的烟管了。</p>
<p>由於她的談話中，我知道黎先生已由廣東而到洛陽，參加所謂重大關鍵的國難會議去了。她本來可以趁此機會去看［行都］的牡丹，（一切招待費，都是政府底的原故）可是因爲黎先生帶了一個由私人書記而變爲姨太太的女人去，這使她覺得難堪，樂得在家裏閒散閒散了。不過，黎先生自去洛陽以後便寄了好些錢來，並且有把握謀着一個很可發財的位子，這到是可以敎黎太太笑逐顔開的。</p>
<p>［聽說上海又要打仗了，這怎麽好呢？］她突然擔　的問，於是我也迎著她說：</p>
<p>［没有的事吧。是是黎太太！明天打［九官］或［萬金］到是頂好的字哩。］</p>

<p>從一點鐘兩點鐘以至於三點鐘四點鐘，在幾次三番的微雨之後，希望終於變成了事實。</p>
<p>歪帶帽子的童子軍在丁鈴丁鈴的脚踏車鈴聲中穿過了我們的視綫，隨後便是載着花圈的汽車，載着靈柩的汽車，載着女童子軍的汽車，載着洋男洋婆的汽車，汽車緊接着汽車、汽車之後還是汽車。</p>
<p>一羣綠色的送殯者在觀衆的眼簾中消失以後，昻着頭的縮回了頭，站在馬路中間的人們退進了人行道，最後，靜安寺門口的拆字先生，在幾度摸小鬍子之後，下了他那特别包廂小板橙。</p>
<p>歸途上，聽到了兩種聲音：</p>
<p>［嘸啥好看！］</p>
<p>［早曉得如此，誰高興等三四個鐘頭！］</p>
<p>回去在書桌上看了報纸之後，</p>

<p>美車銷售不暢</p>
<p>英國之汽車製造業。在歐洲方面雖稱發達。然與美國相較。出品多寡。大相懸殊。故英國自造之汽車。尚不敷本國及其附殖民地等處之應用。於是美製汽車。在英倫市塲上。遂佔一重要之位置矣。爾來歐洲經濟狀况。一落千丈。百業凋零。民生大難。各國爲維持其本身利益起見。無不用種種方法。奬勵國内工業之發展。並鼓勵國民努力購自造之國貨。故英國乃有［買不列顚貨］之口號。所受之影響。雖不盡如上言。要亦有若干相連之關係耳。</p>
<p>去年由美運往英國銷售之汽車。爲數不過三千三百三十輛。若與往年相較。大見衰落。兩年前一九三○年。美製汽車已經銷於英國者。計一萬零六百九十四輛。一九二九年爲數更鉅。共計二萬二千七百二十九輛。以此三個數目互相比較。消長盛衰。蓋可瞭如指掌矣。今單去年十二月而論。此一個月中。美國所造之汽車及車架等運往英國出售者。其總數不過八十件。一九二九年同時。乃有一千零十九件之多。</p>
<p>美國汽車之所以不能在英暢銷者。其理由已略如上述。此外又有一頗重大之原因。則爲馬力抽稅之實行。及小形汽車之風行是也。馬力抽稅者。係根據汽車馬力之大小。而徴其應納之稅。尚有外製汽車之進口抽稅。亦極嚴重。購買者因外貨抽稅之重。往往裏足不前矣·至於英製之大汽車。邇來銷塲更形冷落如二十匹三十匹四十匹馬力者。抽稅奇重。馴至無人顧簡。故其舊車之出售亦不能得到相當之善價。最近英倫某荷蘭商人。曾購英國舊汽車四百餘輛。運往荷蘭。因其地尚無所謂馬力抽稅之例也。</p>
<p>英國汽車製造商爲避免馬力抽稅起見。竭力製告客種小汽車出售。其馬力大概爲九匹·十匹·及十五匹。上次英倫汽車展覧會開幕時。有汽車商行十二家。咸以小汽車陳列塲中。此項汽車大都稱爲孩兒車、其馬力大過十匹者也。小汽車之長處不僅能避免重稅。且於經濟上亦有重大之關係、平時燃料减省。費用可少。故其風行一時。大衆咸有棄大就小之概矣。近二月來。英國汽車之國内銷售。其確數尚未得悉。但知其約數爲一三八·○○○輛而已。美製汽車之銷數則不過四·二○○輛也。此數若與一九三○年之一五五·○○○輛相較。所去遠矣。出口方面則因英镑跌價。反有起色去年其數爲一八○九九二件。一九三○年爲二三·二一○件。去年終之十一十二兩月。英鎊跌價頗佔優勢。兩個月間之出口汽車爲四·五六○輛。一九三○年同時。衹有四·一一九輛。</p>
<p>英國汽車商行及製造家。對於美國汽車之運銷。競爭甚烈。英國汽車廠有不少在英國設廠造車者。據去年調查。其美商廠出售之運貨車。係完全在英國製造者。其出口銷售於英屬地各處。結果頗獲餘利。又有一家汽車廠。其出品半數在英製造。結果因商業衰落。銷數跌去百分之十。去年英製運貨汽車之銷數、約計五○·○○○輛。</p>
<p>一九三一年英國汽車之銷售於紐絲倫者、總計二千四百十四輛。價値二七二·二八五鎊。美國汽車之銷數祇四百七十五輛。價値五九·九七五元。美國汽車之銷售於阿非利加者。大見遜色。錫蘭亦有同樣狀况。英國汽車在此兩地之銷數。頗見暢旺。澳洲因種種關　汽車進口咸見低落。但英製汽車之在澳銷數。一九三一年之上半年六個月中。上增至百份之五○·七。一九三○年同時祇及百分之十七。職是之故。英國汽車之出口業尚可樂觀云。</p>

<p>俄之汽車事業。究屬如何。想亦爲讀者所亟於聞悉也。因將蘇俄最近對於汽車事業之計劃與進行概况。錄之以實本刋。</p>
<p>蘇俄工業方面。近來雖日見發展。然汽車製造之工廠。向付缺如。而俄國所用之汽車。本由美國進口。然最近蘇俄當局。鑒於汽車事業之有關國計民生。以及有助軍備。已决擬實行自造汽車。所有汽車工廠。在着手建築者。其中太半已告落成。不久以前。蘇俄第一輛自造汽車。已告功成。報章雜誌。爭載此事。以作慶祝。然第二輛自造汽車。又將發現於市上矣。目前所製汽車。僅在臨時工廠中製造。每天可製成汽車五兩輛。然所有機件。則完全由美國方面運來。是故目前蘇俄所産汽車。與其名之謂自造。不若名之日自配。蘇俄計劃中所造汽車工廠。與美國地屈勞哀最大之新式汽車工廠。並無不同之處。蓋此種車廠。我人已數見不鮮。從另一方面觀察。蘇俄待能自造汽車而後。每天製車千輛。亦非難事。惟時間問題耳。自第一輛汽車製成之日。以達汽車事業完成之時。其進展情狀。自有不光階段。依照程序進行。惟在預定計劃之中。目前已成之車廠。將來能每日産車四百輛。已爲到達最高之目標矣。在希望之中。汽車上所有機件。有若干部分。已能自造。進行程序。已定一五年計劃。最初二年。所有機件。完全由美國運來。自已不過裝配而已。至第三年年底。自造之機件。至少當有一半。第四年年氏。约有百分之七十五。至第五年年底。則舉凡汽車上所需要之一切。已完全可自造。不必仰求美國之供給矣。廠屋之建築方法。完全採取克利扶蘭奥斯汀車廠之形式。此廠落成而後。將來所有一切工作。均不必仰給他人。即水力問題。亦開　人工自流井。在此新廠之中。因各種機件。尚未購來。故各種佈置方法。亦尚未定當。待將來機器購到以後。按照形式。再行佈置。且機器尚未訂定之前。美國·德國·英國等。同時向蘇俄兜攬。以作營業上之競爭。是故在此種狀况之下。將來蘇俄究况採購何國出品。目前亦尚未定當。自去年十一月一日起。實行加緊工作。以冀廠屋之早日落成。將來落成以後。内部所置馬達至少當有六千架。規模之宏大。亦已可想而見。此種巨大之工廠。工人之繁多。自不必說。是故廠方已有建造工人住宅之决議。在此住宅區域之中。舉凡旅館、公園、市政廳、醫院、學校等。與一切有關工人生活之設備。莫不應有盡有。在預定計劃之中。共造四層樓磚屋三百幢。每幢可住二百家。全部落成以後。不啻爲一個新建之市鎭矣。</p>

<p>據最近本埠所得正式統計。一九三一年美國所登記之新製客用汽車。其總數爲一、九○八、○一六輛。是年汽車之銷售數。較一九三○年跌云七○○、○○○輛。前年在美國售出之汽車。其數目爲二、六二六。○六八輛也。目下汽車製造業諸領袖對於本年之汽車業前途。春估計之目光各有不同。某巨頭及若干領袖人物預料一九三二年之塡舊售出數目。將於本年美合衆國之汽車銷數大有裨益。而令其數達到三、○○○、○○○輛之譜。此乃樂觀派之估計。其次者爲固執派。預料最小奶度之汽車銷數當在二、○○○、○○○輛左右。更有人謂今年汽車銷售數大約介於二、五○○、○○○輛及三、○○○、○○○輛之問云、</p>
<p>全美銷售之汽車總數中。以通用汽車公司所造之雪佛蘭危冠軍。其總數計爲五八三、三八七輛。其次則爲福特卡。以九與十之比。屈居亞軍。據去年之統計視之。雪佛蘭之銷數實佔全美汽車售出數之三分之一。一九三一年美國二十家著名汽車之銷數如後。</p>

<p>一九三○年時。璧克及鮑恩台克在美國汽車之銷售位中居第三及第四。一九三一年之潑萊茅斯竟一躍而居於璧克及鮑恩台克之上。位居第三。實爲近來稀有之佳象。潑萊茅斯爲克雷斯勒汽車廠之出品。在東方諸國行銷頗廣。璧克汽車與其售價相等之同儕中。仍舊保持其原有之位置。雖其銷數似見弱於一九三○年。然聲譽之佳。則與並時進矣。一九三一年潑萊茅斯進步甚速。於是將鮑恩台克由第四位而抑之於第五。然在實際上則銷數較一九三○年增加有五千輛之多。福特之出品年焕然一新。挾有四缸及八缸新車問世。頗足動人聽聞。但其在一九三一年之銷數中。則跌落最鉅。一九三一年之銷數計共五二八、五三九輛。較之一九三○年跌去約有五十萬兩輛之鉅。一九三○年之福特銷數計爲一、○五五、一○五輛。一九三○年美國二十家著名汽車之銷數列表如後。</p>

<p>關於汽車銷售之月份關係。照兩年來之統計視之。亦頗有趣。一九三○年及一九三一年美汽車銷數最旺之月均爲四月份。其次則爲五月份。六月與三月咸屬第三位。茲將新車註册之一九三○年及一九三一年月份總比較。錄之如后。一九三○年　　月份　一九三一年</p>

<p>手。故氏實與有攻焉。　　正如其他英美二國汽車大王相同。在未發跡時。家况類多清貧。例若美國之福特。早年曾充工匠。約翰惠萊斯嘗爲修理司務。而英國之奥斯汀伯爵。幼時則爲技師之學徒。毛律斯伯爵。由機器師起手。然則享利伯爵之環境。更不如人。讀其小史。當知其達今日之地位。自亦更萬難矣。彼九歲時即孤。翌年·在倫敦充販報童子。自已覔食。十四至十七歲時。彼入大　鐵道工廠爲學徒。滿師後進李氏製造局。不久復轉入一器具工廠。每星期以五十四小時的汗血。换得二元七角五分之工資。</p>
<p>彼受敎育。僅及三年。不過對於製電學識。頗爲豐富。故又就僱於倫敦電光公司。不幸年方十九。而公司倒閉矣。</p>
<p>彼竟不爲挫折。遂出私蓄微資。獨開一勞埃司小公司。專造弧光燈泡。但是此種營業收入不佳。乃在一八八四年。開始製造發電機器。忽然各棉織廠。船舶。及本地工廠等。先後競用發電機。於是需要大增。但在一九○○年、爲殖民地戰而稍跌價。</p>
<p>當時勞埃司爲購辦時經濟光陰起見。特購汽車一輛。豈料大失所望。蓋此汽車不可靠而多閙聲也。是以亨利遂運入工廠。全件拆開。以觀究莧如何製造。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Future of the Disarmament Conference <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Disarmament is the main task of the League of Nations, enshrined in the highest charter of the League. The formal Disarmament Conference has suffered setbacks, and it was only recently, twelve years after the League's establishment, that it was convened. Now it has been temporarily suspended due to various reasons. Is it really as French Foreign Minister Briand said, "Armaments are the crystallization of mankind's long-term efforts, and their abandonment must await further consideration"?</p>
<p>Bismarck once predicted, "The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 will be seen by posterity as mere child's play." Indeed, the destruction of material and spirit caused by the Great War of 1914 still leaves a deep and painful impression on Europeans. If one mentions the horrors of a future war, it will be even more terrifying than the previous Great War, and may be regarded as child's play. Therefore, the psychology of non-war in Europe is deeply rooted in the minds of ordinary people. People in Central Europe, regardless of gender or age, are all war-weary. It is a pity that the national defense budgets of various countries still far exceed general administrative expenses, making it impossible to balance national finances. Coupled with the disorder of the economic system and the complexity of international relations, the future killing intent may still be on the rise.</p>
<p>The convening of this Disarmament Conference coincided with the world economic panic reaching its peak and Japan's aggression against China being in full swing. At that time, the sound of gunfire in Shanghai formed an extreme contradiction with the voice of mediating peace in Geneva. Although there was a draft convention prepared for five years before the Disarmament Conference, representatives of various countries were still eloquent. After a long period of discussion, the debate has not yet reached the main topic of disarmament. The great powers are all engaged in intrigue, trying to place their own military strength in a superior position while implementing genuine reductions in the military strength of other countries. France takes security guarantees as a prerequisite for disarmament, with the aim of curbing German revenge and permanently holding the hegemony of Europe. Germany hopes that disarmament will be based on the principle of equal treatment, with the aim of breaking away from the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles and reviving German military strength. Italy believes that disarmament is the basis for security guarantees, in sharp contrast to France's position, with the aim of breaking the sophistry of French policy. Britain hopes that the Disarmament Conference will be an extension of the London Naval Treaty, with the aim of preventing the surge of American power. The United States takes reducing war debts as an exchange condition for implementing disarmament, with the aim of breaking the deadlock in the world economy and recreating the prosperity of the American dollar. The Soviet Union advocates complete disarmament, using exaggerated language to expose the false mask of disarmament, with the aim of maintaining the progress of the Five-Year Plan and avoiding external interference. As for Japan, it has no sincerity in disarmament from the beginning, protecting France's position and befriending France so that its aggression against China can proceed unimpeded. The great powers are preoccupied with discussions on general issues. What they are focusing on is not disarmament, but using disarmament as a tool for diplomacy.</p>
<p>As for the recent claims of various countries, they seem to be gradually moving towards the core of the issue on the surface. The restriction of aggressive weapons and the abolition of fierce weapons, after being proposed by British Foreign Secretary Simon, although strongly opposed by France, still received the majority's approval. After this, the focus of discussion will be concentrated on the technical issues of disarmament, and the intrigue among the great powers will become more complex and detailed, causing those of us who are not familiar with military science and weapons technology to fall into a fog. In the end, the great powers are nothing more than trying to use the precise calculation of technical issues to compete for the superior position of their own military strength. What about disarmament?</p>
<p>Moreover, the conflicts of interest among the great powers have become increasingly obvious since Japan's active aggression against our country. There is a triangular struggle among Japan, Russia, and the United States in the Pacific. There is a secret struggle among Germany, France, and Italy in Europe. Issues such as reparations and war debts are all unresolved. The proposal of the Danube Economic Alliance has many obstacles. The League of Nations' twists and turns in the dispute between China and Japan have clearly lost its authority. Recently, optimists even considered Stimson's visit to Europe to be as important as Wilson's visit to Europe after the Great War. Unexpectedly, the contacts between the parties have yielded little results. All of this is enough to highlight the increasingly bleak international background and make the future of disarmament more pessimistic.</p>
<p>In short, the future of disarmament does not depend on the results of the conference in form, but on the shift in the international situation. The dangerous international situation today is enough to prove the hopelessness of disarmament. We can only cite the words of French diplomat Cambon to prove it: "Once the Disarmament Conference loses its financial resources, the world crisis will expand and will not stop until it explodes."</p>
<h3 id="e2">League of Nations Special Committee Held Secret Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of Small Countries Suspect British Ambassador's New Plan</p>
<p>Unanimously Oppose Changing the Original Text of the Resolution</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing Announces Japan's Attempts in Dong Province</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 26th – The League of Nations’ 19-Nation Special Committee met here today to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute. The meeting was not only not open to the public, but also exceptionally secret.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 25th – The chairman of the League of Nations’ 19-Nation Committee, Hymans, issued a notice today to hold a secret meeting at 3:30 pm on the 26th. Under the circumstances that Japan has rejected the draft resolution, the situation in Shanghai is being considered. It is reported that British Ambassador Lampson has forwarded the compromise solution proposed by the Japanese to Geneva, advocating amending the fourth item in the draft, authorizing the Mixed Committee to report to the League of Nations when there is negligence or lack of progress in the troop withdrawal plan, and deleting the eleventh item of the draft. However, the Chinese representatives opposed such a reduction in the power of the Mixed Committee, resulting in the inability to vote on the troop withdrawal period with a majority agreement. Japanese representative Matsudaira today also visited U.S. Secretary of State Stimson to state Japan's attitude towards the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents. The League of Nations today published the full text of the note sent by China on April 21, which is 12 pages long, declaring that the Manchurian puppet government is an exposure of Japan's ambitions, and recalling the guarantees of the United States and the member states of the League of Nations not to recognize any changes in the political status of Manchuria that violate treaties or covenants. It declared that Japan deliberately destroyed the territorial and political integrity of China's Manchurian region, and stationed 60,000 troops there.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 25th – The 19-Nation Special Committee will reopen tomorrow. This decision is the result of an informal discussion among the representatives of various small countries today. Representatives from South American countries, Greece, Spain, and other countries have expressed anxiety due to rumors of a new solution to the Shanghai incident. They fear that this will set a precedent, putting the small countries in a disadvantageous position in future international disputes. It is rumored that British Ambassador Lampson and Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu have drafted a new plan to supplement the fourth item of the draft Shanghai agreement, making the Mixed Committee responsible not only for inspecting the progress of the Japanese troops' withdrawal, but also for reporting any obstruction or non-compliance with reasonable recommendations by either China or Japan. However, this rumor has not been confirmed, so there are many speculations here. It is generally believed that the weakness of the above plan is whether the resolution of the Mixed Committee should be unanimous or effective by a majority vote. The Chinese delegation issued a long article to prepare for tomorrow's 19-Nation Special Committee, describing Japan's attempts in Dong Province, and citing Japan's actions in various important international conferences since the Russo-Japanese War as evidence.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 25th – Most of the representatives of the small countries in the 19-Nation Committee, led by Spanish representative Madariaga, held an informal meeting today to discuss the unanimous attitude that small countries should take if the major powers propose new interpretations of the Committee's resolutions in the open meeting of the 19-Nation Committee, so that the case is easier for Japan to accept. The attitude decided by the small countries has not yet been released, but it expresses opposition to relaxing the scope of the original interpretation of the resolution and reducing its weight.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 25th – The small countries in the League of Nations’ 19-Nation Committee have decided to oppose changing the original text of the resolution or its interpretation. However, it is heard that the representatives of the major powers, including U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, have mostly considered whether the resolution of the 19-Nation Committee can be given a broader interpretation in private talks in recent days to avoid creating a serious crisis. League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond is most active in this matter and held a luncheon today, among whose guests were several members of the 19-Nation Committee and British Prime Minister MacDonald.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th – British Ambassador to China Lampson's revised new plan for the Sino-Japanese ceasefire has been accepted in principle by the National Government. This news has been verified in London today. It is generally believed that this new plan is expected to be accepted by the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th – According to responsible persons in the provinces today, Lampson's proposal could be given preferential consideration if it were submitted to the Shanghai Peace Conference rather than being submitted in Geneva. Japan insists on complying with the procedures under the League of Nations’ resolution of March 4, and cannot recognize the legal status of the 19-Nation Special Committee established under the resolution of March 14. It is heard that Nanjing has agreed to Lampson's plan. If so, the Japanese government hopes that the Shanghai negotiations can be reopened soon and a ceasefire agreement can be concluded.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 25th – Foreign Secretary Simon issued a statement on the stalemate in the Sino-Japanese negotiations in Shanghai, stating that the main difficulty lies in the timing of the withdrawal of Japanese troops. This issue is being investigated by the 19-Nation Committee, and no useful report can be made before the Committee has made a resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Turnaround in Ceasefire Conference <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Guo Taiqi and Lampson Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Drafting Committee to Open This Morning First</p>
<p>It is Heard that Guo's Matter of Being an Envoy to England Has Been Eliminated</p>
<p>Foreign Vice-Minister Guo Taiqi and British Ambassador Lampson, in Beijing, met with Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, and Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the Shanghai ceasefire issue. Because the compromise solution proposed by British Ambassador Lampson has been accepted by our government authorities, Vice-Minister Guo and British Ambassador Lampson took Chiang Kai-shek's private Ford plane back to Shanghai at 10:30 am yesterday. Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army, also returned to Shanghai on the same plane. British Ambassador Lampson went to the Japanese Consulate General at 3 pm to visit Japanese Envoy Shigemitsu and secretly talked for an hour before leaving. British Ambassador Lampson has been shuttling between Beijing and Shanghai to mediate peace. Now, the 11th article of the resolution passed by the special committee of the League of Nations stipulates that the final withdrawal date of the Japanese army shall be determined by the Shanghai Joint Committee by a majority vote after any party moves to convene a meeting. Japan has expressed its opposition. The League of Nations has become deadlocked, and the ceasefire conference here cannot be reopened. Therefore, the British Ambassador proposed another compromise solution to our government authorities. According to diplomatic sources, the compromise solution proposed by the British Ambassador only makes textual amendments to the 11th article of the current League of Nations resolution, making it milder than the original text, but there is not much change in the original meaning. As for the words "majority vote" or "unanimous agreement", they have been deleted, because the annex to the draft ceasefire agreement on the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee, which was agreed upon at previous meetings here, already has this provision, and there is no need for the League of Nations resolution to repeat it. Our government has expressed its acceptance of the British Ambassador's compromise solution.</p>
<p>Japan is also unlikely to oppose this, and the deadlock in Geneva is expected to be broken. The reopening of the ceasefire conference here is becoming a matter of time.</p>
<p>As for when the ceasefire conference will reopen, Vice-Minister Guo said yesterday when he returned to Shanghai that the date of the meeting can only be determined after the League of Nations has passed a resolution. Our policy has not changed at all on this point. According to diplomatic predictions, the special committee of the League of Nations is expected to pass a resolution at the meeting last night, and a report will be sent to Geneva today. In the next few days, there may be a possibility that the ceasefire conference will be reopened here based on the League of Nations resolution, because all parties have been prepared and are only awaiting developments in Geneva.</p>
<p>Although the general assembly of the ceasefire conference and the military sub-committee are still about to be opened but have not yet been opened, a drafting committee was established last night. The committee is only composed of representatives from China, Britain and Japan. The Chinese side is Zhang Sixu, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese side is Katsuo Okazaki, Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, and the British side is Takeman, Chinese Secretary of the British Embassy. They were notified separately last night that they would meet at the British Consulate General at 10 am this morning to make a final review of the articles and sentences passed at previous ceasefire conferences.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Guo Taiqi's transfer to the position of envoy to England, which is related to the ceasefire conference, this newspaper once said that this matter has a certain political background, and Guo may not take the post as envoy to England. Vice-Minister Guo recently went to Beijing, and this matter was originally related to it. Mr. Guo has not yet made any concrete expression on the issue of envoy to England when he returned to Shanghai today. He only said that the time is still far away. According to those familiar with the inside story, the matter may have been eliminated invisibly as a result of Mr. Guo's visit to Beijing.</p>

<p>Suzhou, 26th – The towns of Liuhe and Floating Bridge have been stabilized. The stores have opened one after another, but the Japanese currency cannot be effectively resisted and is most abused by gamblers. An enemy plane reconnoitered Kunshan at 10:30 on the 26th. The enemy in Liuhe suddenly argued in two factions on the morning of the 25th. Later, most of them boarded ships one after another and returned to their country. The number of enemy troops stationed there is now less than 200. There are no large groups of Japanese troops in Anting, only sentries come and go. Shirakawa inspected the vicinity of Liuhe on the afternoon of the 25th, and the residents of Zhujiazhuang fled in droves.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Statement of the Northeastern National Salvation Army <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Qing, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern National Salvation Army, and all armed comrades issued a circular telegram and declaration, which are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Circular telegram to the Central Party Department, Party Departments at all levels, the National Government, Governments at all levels, Legal Organizations, Mass Organizations, Newspapers, and all armed comrades and compatriots across the country: The three northeastern provinces have fallen for half a year now. The Japanese imperialists are displaying their territorial ambitions, following the old trick of annexing Korea, buying traitors, and establishing a puppet state. The 30 million compatriots in the eastern provinces are about to be reduced to slaves and beasts of burden and cannot extricate themselves. Comrades are burning with anxiety and cannot live in peace. We believe that the only plan for today is to expand the organization of the national armed forces, engage in the national liberation war, restore the territory, and return our rivers and mountains. There is no other strategy. The organization of the "Northeastern National Salvation Army" is pledged to this purpose. We will rise up and kill the enemy. Before the Japanese army has completely withdrawn from the territory, even if there is only one person left, we will fight to the end. The gods of our whole country, the patriotic enthusiasm, who is not as good as us? Those who are willing to share the same hatred with the enemy, why not come? This army is the vanguard.</p>
<p>Declaration Since the September 18th Incident, the violent Japanese army has occupied all important places in my three northeastern provinces in the shortest possible time. They thought that our national army could be easily deceived and the authorities could be threatened, so they went on to burn Qingdao, attack Fuzhou, bomb Shanghai, and force Shantou. Amidst the panic of the whole country, tens of millions of people in the northeast are even more trapped in a situation of no assistance. The violent Japanese took this opportunity to buy national traitors, establish a puppet state, and carry out the old trick of annexing Korea, disturbing and taking our rich and vast territory. If the northeastern heroes and the compatriots of the whole country are willing to let their country be turned into the second Korea and willingly be slaughtered, what else is there to say? If not, then it is appropriate to take action quickly and not leave any regrets. This is why the Northeastern National Salvation Army was organized. Here is a report to the country and my northeastern compatriots. What my country is good at compared to Japan is the determination of the people to resist imperialism. What is lacking is the strong, sharp, and cruel weapons for military use. The victories of the troops stationed in Songhu and the long-term resistance of the armed people in the northeast have already shown that what is good at can more than make up for what is lacking. However, the invasion of Japanese imperialism is using the power of the entire country. If my country resists individually in various places and cannot establish close contact and respond to each other, it will inevitably fail. Therefore, resistance must be a national mobilization, organize its steps, and jointly seek the final victory. This is what the Northeastern National Salvation Army ardently hopes for during its arduous struggle. Moreover, if my country wants to seek freedom and independence, there is no other way but for the people of the whole country to rise up with their own strength and fight to the end. Military victory, future ceasefires and peace talks, can only obtain relatively favorable terms. To get rid of humiliation, it is futile to seek not one's own efforts, but to expect the mediation of friendly countries. Only to seek military victory, there must be a determination to fight persistently. In the persistent struggle, even if there are small sacrifices, one must not lose heart because of it and make compromises for peace negotiations. The Northeastern National Salvation Army is vowed to sacrifice blood and brains to exchange for national independence and freedom, and death is more than glorious.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must recognize that the war of resistance against Japan is to seek the liberation of our entire nation and to increase the international status. Its nature is different from the repeated civil wars. Therefore, the Northeastern National Salvation Army, wherever it goes, must first establish civil rule, protect the freedom of the people, and establish the foundation of a democratic system in the national anti-Japanese struggle. Based on the above points, establish the creed as follows: First, to resist the violent Japanese, all armed people in the northeast should share the same hatred with the violent Japanese troops who forcibly occupy my three provinces. When fighting against the Japanese army, the armed people of all roads must take unified steps and provide close support. I also hope that the northeastern army currently stationed in Guan Nei will set out from Guan Wai and fight together. Second, to eliminate the puppet state, establishing a puppet state is a trick of the Japanese imperialists. Its intention is to use Han traitors as puppets. It must be known that the purpose of the Japanese imperialists occupying the northeast is to eliminate the industry and commerce of my people and replace them with the business of the Japanese, and to seize the farmland of the people and replace them with the reclamation of the Korean people. Once sovereignty is lost, there is no guarantee. It is difficult for my weak business to compete with the strong capital. Therefore, to punish the puppet state is the only way for tens of millions of compatriots in the northeast to survive. Third, to defend the local area, the Northeastern National Salvation Army is pledged to be the armed force of the northeastern people. Wherever the army goes, it will be tasked with eliminating the Japanese army and protecting the lives and property of my compatriots. Armed forces that cannot defend the local area or protect the lives and property of compatriots are thieves of the people and fools of the country, and are not true national armed forces. Fourth, to support civil rule, the Northeastern National Salvation Army is pledged to be the team that protects compatriots, is intent on resisting Japan, and does not participate in civil affairs. After recovering all places, my northeastern people will immediately establish local autonomy under the assistance of this army. All matters that should be promoted or reformed will be decided by the will of the majority. Under the above four conditions, the Northeastern National Salvation Army is a branch of the national anti-Japanese and national salvation army. In the national mobilization, following the compatriots of the whole country, we will deal with the violent Japanese. I do not want to be subjugated, who can subjugate me? This is the greatest creed of this army.</p>

<p>The two party departments sent a telegram to Ma Zhanshan, which is seen by all newspapers. Recently, a telegram was sent to General Ma Zhanshan in Tongbei. The text reads, "The country is in crisis, General Ma Zhanshan of Tongbei, greetings. After reading the two telegrams, I know that the General has risen up to resist Japan and is making persistent efforts. The sound of the wind is spreading, and the sea is rejoicing. Since the Shenyang Incident, Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, the territory has changed color, and the southeast half has been deeply devastated. At this time of national survival, when the League of Nations is conducting a thorough investigation, the General has shouted out to expose the dark curtain, issue the conspiracy of the violent Japanese, and correct the international vision and hearing. With the Han Dynasty in mind, the General has greatly invigorated the national soul, followed the righteousness of Itagaki Masayoshi, and restored the old view of Jiangshan. The people of the whole country will be the General's backing. I specially send this telegram to express my comfort and encouragement. May you be aware of it. Printed by the Special Party Department of the Kuomintang Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway."</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japan Uses Koreans to Colonize Zhabei <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese army forcibly occupied Zhabei, a false local maintenance association was first established. Recently, it has instigated Koreans to move to Zhabei in the name of doing business to seek to occupy power. The following is a record of recent events:</p>
<p>Korean Commercial Observation Group in Dalian and Qingdao, with the approval of the Japanese authorities, has organized commercial observation groups to come to Shanghai to inspect Zhabei. First, more than 20 Koreans from Qingdao went to Northern Shanghai to inspect, so that they can move shops to Baoshan Road. Recently, 20 Korean businessmen from Dalian, Jin Shunnan, Zhang Tiangen, Li Shanyu, Zheng Yuzhou, Park Boksun, Yin Baiwan, etc., who are Koreans doing business in Dalian, formed a observation group to Shanghai to inspect the Zhabei area and planned to open shops under the guidance of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Korean Prostitute Houses Since many Japanese soldiers are stationed in Zhabei, the Japanese have recently moved three classes of Korean prostitute houses from Qingdao. Twenty prostitutes, including Bei Dongxing, Wu Biyi, Cui Fenyi, Jin Shunyi, Zhao Caiyi, and Park Youkuo, were led to Shanghai by Koreans Jin Dayu, Zhao Chengshou, Li Guanggu, and Li Hetong. They immediately went to Zhabei, established prostitute houses, and set up wine houses, etc., saying that they were for the entertainment of Japanese soldiers. Some of them were sent to Wusong.</p>

<p>All Chinese workers at the Yesson Shipyard's Pudong and Broadway Road factories refused to repair a Japanese shallow-draft warship that was damaged by the artillery fire of our 19th Route Army when the enemy attacked Liuhe. The factory's manager insisted on refusing because he had signed a repair contract with Japan, which led to a labor dispute. After Zhao Erchang from the Municipal Party Department and Qiu Peihao from the Social Affairs Bureau went to mediate, they obtained the consent of the manager and all Chinese workers to sign and resolve the dispute.</p>

<p>Commander Cai Allocates a Pension</p>
<p>Chen Jinquan, a Ningbo native residing at 259 Avenue Dubail in the French Concession, was 27 years old and worked as a chauffeur. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, he had deeply resented foreign aggression and immediately joined the 60th Division, 1st Regiment of the 19th Route Army. He was responsible for driving military vehicles in and out of the front lines and transporting ammunition. He worked very diligently and was praised by Regiment Commander Wang. Unfortunately, he was fatally shot by the enemy while our troops were retreating to Nanxiang. His hometown still has his elderly mother and his wife, Ms. Yu, whom he married only last year. They lived together in Shanghai. His passing has left them destitute, which is truly pitiful. When Commander Cai learned of this, he commended his loyalty and bravery and ordered the Shanghai office to allocate a pension of one thousand yuan to support his bereaved family. His mother and wife have already received the full amount.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Shanghai Municipal Council Issues Statement <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office issued a statement regarding the incidents of Japanese people being beaten in the Public Concession as follows:</p>
<p>The hope of Shanghai's future lies in the early restoration of commerce. All those concerned with the interests of this city are striving to restore normalcy today. However, there are many difficulties ahead that need to be overcome. The commerce and prosperity of the Public Concession are based on a fair administrative body. Although this body is subject to extraordinary restrictions due to its special nature, it has managed to gain the trust of all parties, attracting massive investments of hundreds of millions of pounds and a population of over one million.</p>
<p>Shanghai has recently gone through an extremely difficult period. We must face it with courage and genuine goodwill to hope for its recovery. Unfortunately, there are still some unstable forces within the concession. One result is that irresponsible Chinese people have repeatedly assaulted Japanese civilians. Such incidents further delay the recovery of normalcy, which is something no sensible person desires. If they continue to occur, they may cause serious disputes. Attacking individuals is of no benefit to the country. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council firmly believes that the Chinese press can use its power to persuade all residents not only to maintain public order themselves, but also to do their best to prevent others from disrupting it. The Shanghai Municipal Council has always done its best to maintain public order, and will continue to work hard and use all available tools to protect residents of all races. However, the efforts of the Shanghai Municipal Council must rely on the assistance of the public. All residents, both Chinese and foreign, should contribute to the efforts of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Shanghai Municipal Council, in a spirit of trust, asks for the assistance of the Chinese press to prevent attacks on Japanese people in the concession and to restore normalcy as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Currently Investigating Losses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods, in order to encourage the Zhabei people to use national goods and to promote the sales of products from member factories, held the Zhabei National Goods Exhibition on January 15th for a period of two weeks. The results were quite good. Unfortunately, due to the impact of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, it could not be safely closed. The goods of the factories were damaged, and the association's affairs have not yet been concluded. Yesterday, the standing committee of the association decided on the following measures: (1) Send personnel to the factories to conduct on-site investigations of losses and report them to the Social Affairs Bureau. (2) All expenditures will be appropriated according to the original budget, and Fang Jiange, Pan Dechun, and Wang Dongyuan will be publicly elected to review the accounts. (3) Collect materials and print a report booklet to distribute to the factories. (4) Schedule a final meeting for next Thursday. The above measures will be handled by Xu Jianhou, Zhang Deqi, and Chen Binghui, the three standing committee members, together with the staff of the various departments, to complete the procedures.</p>

In addition, the Japanese side sent 40 military police, gendarmes, and high-ranking criminal investigators, as well as 200 plainclothes detectives, to monitor the actions of the investigators and their attendants, as well as the contact between local people and the investigation team. In order to prove that they cannot withdraw their troops, the Japanese secretly sent 600 Korean ruffians dressed in Chinese clothes to act as bandits, planning to riot within days as an excuse.

The people who were sent to greet the team included Zheng Xu (Zheng Xiaoxu's nephew) and Zheng Zidong, the inspector-general of the Shenyang Police Bureau. Before the investigation team arrived in Shenyang, martial law was imposed, and Japanese police and security team police were transferred to work as plainclothes detectives. In addition, a division of Japanese troops was transferred from Lushun to increase defenses. Zang Shiyi was usually heavily monitored by the Japanese, and he knew nothing about the investigation team coming to the Northeast beforehand. The Department of Education ordered schools to send students to welcome the investigation team with flags and to have six female students present flowers. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) A Reuters special correspondent, who arrived here from the Eastern Provinces, said that the attitude of Manchukuo towards Gu Weijun has put the League of Nations investigation team in a difficult situation. The investigation team is still struggling and has not yet made any decision, but its decision will probably not be outside of the following points: (1) The entire team goes north, with Dr. Gu not leaving Lord Lytton's side. (2) The members of the investigation team advance alone, while the Chinese and Japanese assessors are left in Shenyang. (3) Part of the team sets off, and part of the team stays in Shenyang with the assessors. (4) The investigation team succumbs to the obstruction policy and abandons its procedures. The investigation team's office in Shenyang is in a Japanese hotel, and its living rooms and corridors are full of Japanese detectives. It is said that several Chinese who attempted to enter the hotel have been arrested by the Japanese police. All streets are lined with Japanese military police, and many Japanese are wearing Chinese police uniforms. There are many Japanese on the railway section from Shanhaiguan to Shenyang. When the special correspondent passed by train, he encountered several military trains of Japanese soldiers from the South Manchuria Railway heading to Shenyang, presumably because the Japanese army in Shenyang has continued to move to Harbin in the past few days, so these Japanese soldiers went to Shenyang to fill the defenses. It is said that a division of Japanese troops is currently in Harbin, preparing to launch a large-scale campaign along the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway to suppress the troops that oppose Manchukuo. When the special correspondent's train passed Goubangzi, Japanese soldiers lined up on the platform to see off a Japanese military officer. There was also a group of Japanese geishas and several Manchukuo cavalrymen waving the flags of Manchukuo and Japan in the ranks. When they arrived at Suizhong County, the passengers were all checked by Japanese soldiers with guns, and even foreigners were not exempt. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Joined Forces with Ding and Li to Advance Westward</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Jilin said that after the September 18th Incident, Wang Delin's troops had only 400 soldiers and more than 300 guns. They secretly resisted Japan. When two Japanese who were surveying the Jihui Road were killed in December last year, the Japanese sent envoys to mediate, but they refused to yield. In less than two months, they gathered 30,000 people and more than 20,000 guns, organized into four brigades and one independent regiment. They mostly used guerilla warfare, so Japanese tanks, airplanes, and artillery could not be effective. In the Battle of Dunhua on February 21st, they killed 30 enemies, captured 2 machine guns and seized 8 more. Near Huangheniizi, they shot down two enemy planes. In the Battle of Nanhutou on March 8th, they captured one mountain gun and killed more than a hundred enemies. Our army only suffered about a hundred casualties. At the moment, the army has recovered four counties including Dongning, Ningan, Mishan, and Muling. They have also joined forces with Ding Chao and Li Du, and are advancing westward step by step, hoping to join forces in Changchun and overthrow the puppet government run by the Japanese.

The draft amnesty law was reviewed jointly by the Law and Military Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the 26th. According to a certain committee member, the scope of this law is very broad, and colleagues believe that social order is still in a state of unrest, and once implemented, there will be great abuses. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider it. Moreover, the so-called amnesty is not a general or complete amnesty, and it is necessary to take into account the facts and set the standards for reduction or exemption based on the severity of the circumstances. There are also those who advocate postponing the implementation, which is quite reasonable. Although the case has been submitted for review, it is difficult to obtain a result in the short term due to the complexity of the issue. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Vladivostok Establishes Naval and Air Force Bases</p>
<p>Nationwide Party Members Military Registration and Training</p>
<p>Promote US-Russian Alliance to Jointly Restrain Japan</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: The Morning Post published an article this morning discussing Soviet Russia's preparations for war against Japan. It stated that since the end of last year, Russian troops and war materials have been continuously transported to eastern Siberia, and the number of troops stationed on the border has also increased. The construction of fortifications in Vladivostok is being carried out under the guidance of experienced technicians, many of whom are German military officers. Vladivostok has now also established air force and submarine bases. The submarines were dismantled and transported from the Black Sea to Vladivostok, where they were manufactured and assembled by German technicians and mechanics. There are now about 15 to 20 submarines launched in Vladivostok. A naval and air base is currently being established in Posyet Bay, which is not far from the Korean border, thus endangering the Japanese naval bases in northern Korea.</p>
<p>National, Moscow, 25th: It is learned that all Communist Party members of military age are currently preparing to actively defend the Soviet Union. All Communist Party members must undergo physical and intellectual examinations to determine their suitability for a certain type of military service or a certain type of rear service, and register with the state so that they can be conscripted in the future. Millions of people have already been examined. All five million members of the Communist Youth League and most of the three million Communist Party members are currently receiving appropriate military training according to their talents. All Russian newspapers attach great importance to the New York telegram of the American Associated Press international affairs expert Siemens's paper and the Scripps Howard newspaper's editorial urging Russia and the United States to restore normal relations, claiming that the opinions expressed in the paper and the editorial are in line with the most influential public opinion in Russia today. They recognize the United States as one of the most powerful forces in the Far East situation. Although there are no formal relations between Soviet Russia and the United States because the Americans refuse to recognize the Soviet government, the Russians want to recognize the United States as a powerful ally in the event of a war against Japan. Moscow is now continuing to promote the possibility of a Russian-American alliance to restrain Japan and hope to slow down its aggressive actions in Siberia.</p>
<p>National, Washington, 25th: Today, US Senator Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Borah stated that although the sentiment in the United States regarding the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia is gradually increasing, it has not yet reached the stage of being submitted to the Senate for discussion. Borah further stated that he himself has a very good impression of recognizing Soviet Russia, but feels that the time is not yet ripe, so he is not convenient to strongly advocate it. Borah also explained the reasons for the trend of recognizing Soviet Russia, saying that one reason is that the United States is affected by economic pressure and wants to increase foreign trade, and the other is that the United States believes that the recognition of Soviet Russia can prevent the danger of Russo-Japanese war from becoming more sinister.</p>

<p>National, Geneva, 26th: The 16th International Labor Conference ended this afternoon, with more than twenty resolutions passed one after another, all related to the international economic crisis and the international unemployment problem. Regarding solving the unemployment problem, it is recognized that holding public works projects to shorten working hours is the most effective method. International Labor Bureau Director Thomas delivered a closing speech, strongly refuting rumors that the representatives' differing opinions hindered the progress of the conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 26th: When the International Labor Conference held a plenary meeting today, Chinese and Japanese representatives engaged in a fierce verbal battle. The Chairman of the Credentials Committee, Yoshihisa (Japan), declared that the delegations of certain countries, including China, cannot be complete, in fact, due to special reasons in the country. The Chinese representative Shi Dongfa (transliteration) rose to object, saying that the incompleteness of the Chinese delegation is not due to a disregard for conference affairs, but in fact, due to recent foreign troubles, which made it impossible for employers and labor representatives to gather to elect representatives. Shi also demanded that Yoshihisa withdraw his previous remarks, but Yoshihisa only agreed to include the Chinese representative's protest in the official record.</p>

<p>National, Geneva, 25th: Today, the main committee of the International Disarmament Conference decided that the General Committee will suspend meetings for the next two weeks, tacitly acknowledging that there is unlikely to be progress before the French elections. Therefore, the General Committee will be convened tomorrow morning to submit this matter for a vote. However, the main committee decided that during these two weeks, if the Technical Committee completes its work on formulating definitions of aggressive and defensive weapons, the General Committee should still meet, but no new issues will be raised. This time, the UK advocated suspending meetings for two weeks, while France attempted to change the agenda and immediately discuss the US plan to limit land armaments. US representative Gibson objected, claiming that the later cases on the agenda all rely on the resolution of the plans of France and Germany. Therefore, after the General Committee meets, it should first discuss the plans of France and Germany, but it feels that the main committee should devote itself to private contacts in these two weeks so that there can be some progress on the various political issues before they are raised for discussion again.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 25th: The term of the current Prussian cabinet will expire on May 20. In view of the results of Sunday's elections, the cabinet will probably resign on its own accord and is unwilling to be subjected to a vote of no confidence when Parliament reconvenes. However, the current cabinet must remain in office until a new cabinet is formed. It is expected that forming a cabinet will be difficult. The current Prime Minister Braun and the Minister of Interior may have to continue to hold power in Prussia for some time. Whether the National Socialist Party can obtain the support of the Central Party members or its preferential neutrality and hold power will have to wait until Parliament is convened before it can be judged. The Central Party members currently have 67 votes.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 26th: Today, the Prussian Ministry of Interior officially announced that the new Prussian Parliament will be convened on May 20, and at the same time expressed that Prussian Prime Minister Braun and the cabinet members will resign as soon as the new parliament is established and held a meeting.</p>

<p>National, Paris, 25th: The French general election is only a week away, so the election 　activity is now becoming more and more intense, and national public opinion is especially speculating about the election result, with varying opinions. However, looking at the overall situation, the world is affected by economic depression, and France cannot be an exception, so the result of this election must also be slightly left-leaning, which is an inevitable trend. Furthermore, the extreme Socialist Party is taking advantage of the instability of people's minds to seek the victory of its party. However, even if the Socialist Party wins, the foreign policy will not change. There are also those who say that Tardieu will join hands with the leader of the extreme Socialist Party Herriot and jointly enter the cabinet, which is also one of the predictions.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Increasing Japanese Troops <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Third Division Arrives in Jilin and Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Hirose's Tenth Division Has Arrived</p>
<p>Eighth and Ninth Divisions Will Follow</p>
<p>National Salvation Army Headquarters Established in Suifenhe</p>
<p>A Brave and Capable Young Female Captain</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Japanese Army's Tenth Division from Himeji arrived in Harbin on the 18th.  Its main force is still en route and is expected to arrive completely within ten to twelve days. The division commander is Lieutenant General Hirose, commanding four infantry regiments, two cavalry regiments, and one artillery regiment, totaling 16,000 personnel.  In the future, except for three regiments remaining in Harbin, the rest will be deployed along the Harbin-Suifenhe railway line.  Besides this division, the Eighth and Ninth Divisions will arrive in Jilin and Heilongjiang soon, together with the old Second Division, the Suzuki Mixed Brigade, and the Murai Mixed Brigade, reaching the Japanese plan of 75,000 troops. The commander of the Second Division, the Yokokawa Brigade, will go to the Jilin-Changchun railway line to take charge of the garrison, while the Amano Brigade will be stationed in Heilongjiang Province for a long time.  The Japanese heavy troops gathering in Jilin and Heilongjiang are not only targeting us but also Russia.  However, Japanese propaganda claims they will attack Ding Li's self-defense army and the National Salvation Army, and plan to use the first batch of ships dispatched when the river ice melts to transport Japanese soldiers to the lower reaches of the Songhua River to attack Yilan and Fujin.  It is rumored that the newly arrived Eighth and Ninth Divisions will also be specifically assigned to this task. The self-defense army in the Yilan and Fujin area, with the support of Ma Zhanshan's army from eastern Heilongjiang, recovered Fangzheng County last week.  It is now garrisoned by Chen Zongdai's troops.  A small number of Japanese troops and Xi Qia's troops have retreated to Gaoli Maozi and Jiaxinzi. Xi Qia's troops are unwilling to kill each other; each soldier has both red and yellow armbands.  When the self-defense army arrives, if they cannot retreat in time, they wear red armbands to show their allegiance.  Therefore, the Japanese side deeply suspects that Xi Qia's troops have a tacit understanding with the Jilin army and are completely unreliable. The National Salvation Army on the eastern section of the Eastern Railway advanced to Shitouhezi on the 18th.  The main force joined the Second Route led by Liu Wankui and moved towards Gaolingzi.  Xi Qia's troops retreated to Weishahe, relying on the assistance of Japanese troops from Yimianpo to form a front line.  On the 18th, the railway tracks between Dadaohezi and Shitouhezi stations were dismantled by Xi Qia's troops to prevent the advance of the National Salvation Army, so the National Salvation Army is currently stationed in that area. The Japanese Army's Murai Brigade is constructing defensive works in the southern mountains of Yimianpo to prevent the National Salvation Army from attacking.  Vehicles on the Harbin-Suifenhe railway line are frequently delayed due to the advances and retreats of the National Salvation Army and the Japanese army. Wang Delin's National Salvation Army headquarters has recently moved to Suifenhe.  Its commando teams are still active near Yanji. The International Youth Army is expanding its organization by contacting Koreans and Japanese, echoing Wang's army. The Japanese side fears that deeper incursions will be unfavorable, and because the area is on the Russian border, it is easy to have direct conflicts with Russia, so they are only deploying troops between Erdaogou and Longjingcun. Recently, they also transferred an air force team to be stationed there permanently for assistance. From Yimianpo to Suifenhe, local officials and tax authorities are being replaced by the National Salvation Army. All politics are in order, and the people love the National Salvation Army. They also provide special protection for the Eastern Railway traffic. Passengers traveling there do not feel any danger. A branch headquarters of the National Salvation Army is located in Hengdaohe, with a captain who is a beautiful young woman, wearing a blue silk shirt, carrying a Mauser pistol, often riding a horse through the streets, extremely brave and capable, and the soldiers are very respectful to her. The Japanese side claims that she is from Soviet Russia and graduated from the Far East International Military and Political School. (19th)</p>

<p>Official Circles Claim to "Prohibit Through Taxation"</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: When Anhui, Henan, Hubei and other provinces opened up opium prohibition and established taxation bureaus in the past, those in the North with a desire for profit were extremely envious. They repeatedly agitated for the public sale of opium in North China. Gu Zhang Xueliang expressed his opposition. The Hebei Provincial Civil Affairs Director Wang Yuke also once said to others, "I only have one son. I will never do anything unethical." Unexpectedly, after the September 18th Incident, the Northeast Army obeyed the order of non-resistance and successively withdrew into the pass, with no fewer than 200,000 people. In the past, the military expenses were shared by Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, and Chahar, and assisted by the Central Government. With the national crisis, the central government's finances were extremely stretched and no longer assisted. Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces were also occupied by the Japanese army. After Hebei and Chahar provinces abolished likin, the provincial treasury revenue sharply declined. Although taxes such as business production and sales were used to compensate, it was only about one-third of the previous likin revenue. Expenses for political and educational construction were already insufficient. Now, suddenly adding military expenses for 100,000 to 200,000 people, how can they bear it? Therefore, the Beiping Financial Reorganization Committee was born in response to the times. The so-called reorganization is that no matter how difficult each agency is, they are required to raise a certain amount of military expenses every month. Therefore, each agency only has one way: to reduce salaries and report effectiveness. At first, 80% of the salary was issued, and then 80% of 80% was issued, so in reality, only 65% was issued. For clerks and secretaries with a monthly salary of 20 yuan, the actual amount received each month was 13 yuan. It is not even enough for personal food, let alone supporting a family. However, even with such austerity, the amount saved is still not enough to cover the military's expenses, resulting in arrears in pay for several months. The armed ranks have raised difficulties one after another, even threatening to refuse to be responsible if wages are not paid. The provincial and municipal authorities lack the ability to make money, and there have been angry remarks about suspending the payment of political and educational construction expenses (party fees are of course excluded) to pay for military expenses. Unexpectedly, they actually went ahead and publicly sold opium.</p>
<p>Recently, Yan Xishan rectified Shanxi's administration, believing that the people of Shanxi were too deeply addicted to opium, spending more than 50 million yuan each year. To gradually eliminate the poison, he implemented the official sale of anti-smoking medicine. This anti-smoking medicine uses opium paste as the main raw material. It is estimated that it can generate 20 million yuan in profit each year to be used for military and political construction expenses. The Hebei provincial authorities, upon hearing this, were greatly envious and also proceeded with the public sale of opium. Zhang Xueliang, due to financial difficulties for military expenses, expressed his tacit approval. However, Hebei Province had long since ceased the cultivation of poppies. Blacklisted goods come from Chahar and Rehe provinces. To ensure that the source is unobstructed and the benefits are shared equally, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces simultaneously implemented public sales. The Rehe provincial authorities have other methods and did not implement the same system. However, the name "public sale of opium" is not elegant, so it is euphemistically called "prohibit through taxation," establishing bureaus and issuing [destruction certificates]. The brewing and maturity of this matter took only ten days, because it was feared that public opinion would be against it, so it was carried out secretly and very quickly. The names of those in charge have not yet been announced, but it is known that the traffickers are all "tigers wearing hats." Real opium traffickers mostly failed to join. In Tianjin, the Northern Company has been established, with capital of an unknown amount, but it is known that a total of more than 3,000 tons of goods have been transported to the Dongkou and Beikou ports, which can be described as shocking. There are also many transporters in transit. The public sale locations in Hebei Province that have been decided are Tianjin, Beiping, Tangshan, Tanggu, Shanhaiguan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Daming, which will be gradually expanded in the future. As far as Hebei Province is concerned, the annual tax is estimated to reach 30 million yuan. It has now been decided to implement public sales on May 1st. After this, anyone who does not affix a destruction certificate will be considered a criminal and arrested. In recent days, soil prices have fallen sharply because there is too much inventory in the concessions, and everyone wants to sell it before the public sale period. However, in the future, major soil traffickers in the concessions will have no way to smuggle it, and there will be many people who will lose their jobs due to the public sale.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the military, police, and gendarmerie agencies in this city received an order from their superiors to investigate and punish private transportation of drugs, with the following content: (1) Gendarmes, police, and road police who seize drugs that have not been affixed with a destruction certificate will be sent to the Drug Prohibition Committee for summary destruction. (2) For the private transportation of drugs mentioned above, one-third of the value estimated by the committee will be used as a cash reward to encourage them. (3) Those who are completely arrested by the gendarmes, police, and road police will receive the full amount of the reward. (4) Those who are arrested after being reported by someone will receive half of the reward for the informer and the gendarmerie/police, respectively. If two or more groups of agencies simultaneously discover or arrest someone, they should share the reward equally. (5) Anyone has the right to report the drugs mentioned above. Those who report should report to the gendarmerie/police in the jurisdiction, and the agency receiving the report should immediately cooperate with the gendarmerie/police to search and arrest them according to the law. (6) Those who make false reports will be fined between 100 and 1,000 yuan. (April 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Gradually Eliminating Bandits in Southern Shandong <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Heilian's Troops Flee to Linyi</p>
<p>People in Shandong Suggest Developing Mengshan</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The bandits Zhang Heilian, Wang Changyou, Yang Guangsheng, Shi Zengfu, and others in southern Shandong were surrounded and severely suppressed by Xie Shuxian, the commander of the southern Shandong militia, leading the militias of Mengyin and Yishui counties, together with the 244th Brigade of Yun Qichang stationed in Yishui. Except for Shi Zengfu, who has already returned to righteousness and was organized as a southern Shandong militia under control,</p>
<p>Zhang Heilian, Wang Changyou, and others fled to Jishan. Yang Guangsheng fled to Niutougu. Soon, Yang Guangsheng was arrested and executed. His troops lost their leader. The headquarters of the southern Shandong militia then ordered the directly subordinate mixed regiment and Shi Zengfu's troops to</p>
<p>Swiftly and fiercely suppress them. On the 20th, the troops were completely defeated, and Yang Guangsheng's parents, wife, and children, as well as thirteen important bandit leaders, were captured. Yang's head has been escorted to the Tai'an County government. Zhang Heilian, Wang Changyou, and others, who were hiding in Jishan, have now fled to the mountains in the boundary of Linyi due to their isolated and weak forces. The commander of the 81st Division stationed in Linyi, Zhan Shutang, will lead his troops to suppress them. Xie Shuxian, the commander of the southern Shandong militia, specially sent Wang Chenmian, the regimental adjutant of his directly subordinate mixed regiment, to Jinan from Xintai at 9:30 yesterday (the 23rd) to report on the recent situation of suppressing bandits. He immediately went to the provincial government to meet with Han Fuju to report on the situation of suppressing Zhang Heilian, Yang Guangsheng, and others, and to ask for</p>
<p>Instructions on how to deal with the captured relatives of Yang Guangsheng. It is said that after Wang met with Han, he was ordered to execute Yang's head and thirteen bandits and display their heads in Tai'an as a warning to the public.</p>
<p>Mengshan in southern Shandong stretches for hundreds of miles, deep and dangerous, with few people. In the past twenty years, it has become a bandit den, making suppression very difficult. The people in hundreds of villages near Mengshan have fled, leaving no one. In the past two years, after repeated suppression, it has gradually been cleared. The mountains are rich in resources. Not only are there inexhaustible mineral and timber resources, but it can also be used as a vast pasture. It is truly a major</p>
<p>Mysterious treasure trove in southern Shandong. Hou Zunzhao, a former lieutenant colonel staff officer of the southern Shandong militia headquarters, who knows the situation in the mountains of southern Shandong, recently submitted a petition to the provincial government, requesting that the Mengshan resources be developed by the militia to combine soldiers and farmers. The content of his petition is roughly as follows: (1) There are more than 300 villages near Mengshan with no one, and most of the fertile land is barren. Therefore, the land tax in Fei, Meng, and Ding counties has been reduced by four-tenths, and the number of people migrating has been reduced by three-tenths. If Mengshan can be developed, the displaced people will return to their homes and cultivate their land, and the land tax will return to its old rules, increasing revenue by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan each year. Not only will industry develop and forestry flourish, but the scenic spots will also be improved. (2) Historically, opening mines and developing wasteland requires huge sums of money. In this difficult time, it is difficult to raise money to proceed. It is planned to use the southern Shandong militia as the backbone of the development, implementing the policy of turning soldiers into workers and combining soldiers and farmers. If the provincial treasury adds working equipment, it can be handled. (3) Although there are many trees in Mengshan, no one is in charge, and people are allowed to cut them down, making prevention difficult. After development, a large-scale forest farm can be planned, which can help the country's wealth. (4) Our country is based on agriculture, with many people and little land in the interior. Over the years, people from Zhili and Shandong have gone to the Northeast to reclaim land, showing that the people are rich in agriculture. Since Mengshan has been developed, the fertile land without people can be sold at official prices, so that the land tax can be returned. The newly developed official property can also be priced to the people and taxed according to law. Since the incidents in the Northeast, the number of farmers going to the Northeast has decreased sharply. Mengshan is located in central Shandong, compared with those who travel thousands of miles to buy land and reclaim it in the Northeast, the advantages and disadvantages of distance are obvious. (5) Take the materials, stone, and soil of Mengshan and set up kilns on the spot to burn lime bricks and tiles, and sell them to farmers at low prices, so that the old villages with few people can be easily rebuilt. The wood of Mengshan can be used as rafters, pillars, and beams, and can also be sold to the people at low prices, so that villages can be easily formed. (6) After Mengshan is developed, cattle can be raised to benefit farmers' cultivation, sheep can be raised to benefit farmers' clothing, chickens can be raised to benefit farmers' food, and there are many beehives in Mengshan, which can be expanded to raise bees. Mengshan has water and can also raise fish. There are many foxes in the mountains, which are considered excellent. (7) Honeysuckle and Polygonum multiflorum are the main products of Mengshan, and other medicinal products can also be planted. Mengshan also produces tea, which is very cool and can treat fire diseases. As for flowers, bamboo, and tea, they can also be planted according to the local conditions. (8) Fei has silver mines, and Meng has coal mines, which can be mined one after another. (9) Historically, the strategy of enriching the country has been mainly to generate profits. The various sources of profit mentioned above are somewhat helpful. Now that the banditry has been cleared, the progress is timely. The procedures for proceeding are to first build the main road to Mengshan to facilitate the people's movement, set up kilns to burn bricks and tiles to facilitate the people's housing, and divide and measure the land to facilitate the people's cultivation. All</p>
<p>These plans and management can belong to the Department of Construction, and the required labor can be taken from the southern Shandong militia. If there are bandits, they will be suppressed. If there is no labor, they will work. Progress will be gradual, and the matter can be accomplished. If so, the southern Shandong militia will benefit the people, and the benefits will be great.

<h3 id="e87">Second Yin Ruins Discovered in Junxian <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Anyang Dispatch: Since last year's case of officials and civilians colluding to steal cultural relics in Xin Village, northwestern Junxian, the Henan Provincial Government detained and prosecuted County Magistrate Zeng Liangdong and strictly ordered the arrest of the fugitives. In order to preserve the cultural relics, the Academia Sinica and the Henan Provincial Government specially formulated eight articles on the method of jointly organizing the Antiquities Research Association and designated Xin Village in Junxian as a pilot area. The Research Association then sent member Guo Baojun to Junxian with Ma Yuancai, a representative of the Henan Provincial Government, to prepare for excavation. Guo and others arrived in Junxian on the 12th of this month. County Magistrate Li Shude of Junxian was ordered in advance to send 30 security team members to protect the village. On the 13th, Guo and others also arrived in the village with County Magistrate Li. On the 16th, work officially began, with dozens of workers. Many cultural relics have been unearthed successively,</p>
<p>Such as stone axes, shell knives, sickles, divination bones, tiles, cooking pots, bronze arrowheads, stone arrowheads, bone arrowheads, and bone saws, all of which are very similar to those unearthed in Xiaotun, Anyang. There is also a section of rammed earth in the southwest, which is especially distinctive. The northern section of the rammed earth was already exposed in the past, with a total of more than 40 layers visible, 6 meters high, about 16 meters long, and about 4 meters wide. Its southwest is covered by a thick layer of loess. The boundary between the loess layer and the rammed earth is obvious. The east wall of the rammed earth is mostly filled with gray soil, which is level with the rammed earth. Most of the cultural relics come from it. There are also rammed earth remains in the north field, about 15 meters long, and the edge has not yet been seen. Each layer is about 0.05 meters thick, slightly different from the above-mentioned thickness of 0.15 meters to 0.2 meters. According to Guo and others, it was rumored last year that this place was the Yin Dynasty mausoleum, but according to the excavation situation in recent days, no definite evidence has been obtained. However, judging from the shape of the unearthed objects and the condition of the strata, it can be asserted that this place is a residential site of the Yin people. As for whether the Yin Dynasty mausoleum is also in this place, one dare not arbitrarily determine it without more abundant materials. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Investigation and Reporting of Disaster Situation in Eastern Henan <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Many People in Various Counties Starved to Death</p>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The terrain in eastern Henan is low-lying, and the flood disaster is particularly severe. Although relief has been provided several times, many people have been saved. However, in this famine spring, when the old grain has run out and the new grain has not yet arrived, disaster reports and requests for relief from various counties are pouring in. The Provincial Relief Association has specially sent Wang Yinghou and others to various counties with severe disasters to investigate the disaster situation in order to find ways to provide relief. At this moment, the members have completed the investigation of the disaster situation in six counties in eastern Henan and reported to the Relief Association. The overview</p>
<p>Is as follows: (1) In Xiayi County, the flood receded relatively late last year, and only five-tenths of the wheat was planted. About one-third of the wheat was dug up and eaten by the disaster-stricken people this spring. Recently, strong winds have repeatedly occurred, causing the wheat seedlings to turn yellow and wither, and the tree buds to wither and fall. Emaciated women and children compete to collect tree leaves as if they were vying for a prize. However, after door-to-door investigations, all families are found to be empty and the stoves are cold. Most people fill their stomachs with leaves, and some mix sorghum hulls to make cakes for food, but it is only eaten once a day or every other day. The situation is the same in other areas, and the misery is indescribable. (2) In Yongcheng County, the northeast two, eight, and nine districts had very little wheat harvest last year, and the autumn was flooded. Because the flood receded relatively late, not enough wheat was planted. The spring was dry, and many seedlings withered. The market price of wheat and beans is 550 wen per catty, and sorghum is 455 wen. Grain prices are extremely high,</p>
<p>Unprecedented. Emaciated people gather in groups to collect wheat seedlings and bark to fill their stomachs. The county government has announced a ban on eating wheat seedlings, but it cannot be stopped. The danger to people's lives can be imagined. (3) In Zhecheng County, the first district, beggars fill the streets in the city. Three abandoned children were found crying for their parents, and one disaster-stricken person starved to death. The relief distribution association has not yet buried them. There are those who carry cypress bark, elm leaves, willow leaves, and sweet potato vines to sell as food. In Dongguan, agricultural implements and utensils are displayed on the street, all sold at reduced prices. More than a thousand disaster-stricken people gather in the Taiyi Temple in Xiguan, and many have died of the seasonal epidemic. According to Li Yongchun, the town leader of Cishengji Town in the second district, Zhang Chun, Liu Xing, and 13 others in the town have starved to death one after another. Zhang Jingxian, the brigade commander, reported that Zhang Xiaoxian and 7 other starving people in the village died of starvation, two young women fled, and countless people became beggars. In the third district, the investigation team saw that the town leader Yang Quanwen was burying disaster-stricken people who had starved to death and said that Yang Xixing and 9 others had starved to death in the town this spring, 5 women had fled, and countless people had become beggars. Moreover, Wang Daochun and 3 others were burned to death and Wang Daomei and 4 others were killed by Li Gongcheng's bandits at the Kaihuangdian Store. Wang Zhongbo and 3 others were kidnapped, and 372 houses were burned, leaving thousands of refugees homeless. The disaster in the fourth district is particularly severe. Every family hears the sound of hunger, and every day people starve to death. Zhang Youdao, a Confucian scholar in Qitaishi Town, committed suicide due to starvation. Lu Yingfa, a wealthy household in Lu Guanmiao Village, had his stored grain divided up and eaten by starving people and committed suicide by jumping into a well with his wife due to starvation. There is a slave market in Hong'enji, and 1,043 houses were burned and 42 people were killed in 18 villages in Xuankou Township by Li Gongcheng. There are also groups of three or five robbing grain and intercepting vehicles, so grain trucks dare not enter the territory. In this time of famine, it is easiest to cause chaos, which has a great impact on local security. The investigation team has consulted with County Magistrate Zhu to find ways to prevent it. (4) In Luyi County, the Liu Huitang family in Liu Wafang Village in the first district committed suicide due to starvation. In the second and third districts, there are almost no people. There are only people with pale faces who are almost blown down by the wind, crawling on the road in groups of four or five. The misery in the two districts is especially severe. Wang, the wife of Sun Lianzhong in Wa Sun Village, had a son who was only four years old and kept crying from hunger. Wang had no way to survive and threw herself into a well to die. Wang Shuang in Qiuquji abandoned his son on the side of the village because his wife had already starved to death and was picked up by the village chief. Wang Shuang traveled to Xiaolizhuang, about ten miles north, and threw himself into a well to die. Li Zicheng's family of three in Liwa Village in the fourth district committed suicide by throwing themselves into the river together. The disaster situation in the sixth, seventh, and eighth districts is similar to that of other districts, but they are more severely ravaged by bandits than other districts. (5) The residents along the Nihe River, twenty miles south of Xiangcheng County, rely entirely on aquatic plants, snails, grass roots, and bark for sustenance. Two people starved to death in Ma Tinglan's family in Malaozhuang, one starved to death in Ma Mao's family, one starved to death in Ma Enzan's family, one starved to death in Ma Nao's family, one starved to death in Lu Zhenlun's family, one starved to death in Zhang Hao's family, one starved to death in Hou Jin Yang's family, and Qiu Ma died of starvation. (6) The disaster situation in Shenqiu County is even more severe. The rich have become destitute, and the poor have become starving corpses. Wild vegetables, bark, aquatic plants, and snails have long been exhausted. Emaciated people are heard crying from hunger along the way. In Xu Lizhuang and other places in the sixth district, nine people, including Lu Zhuo, starved to</p>
<p>Death. In Ximen Village in the first district, three people, including Yang Laoda, starved to death. In Wanglaojia Village in the second district, one Wang Daniu starved to death. In the third district, 16 people, including Li Jianyin, starved to death. The rest are also waiting to be fed and are on the verge of death.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Guizhou Construction Department Surveys and Measures the Huangguoshu Hydropower Plant <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Guiyang Dispatch: In order to prepare for the construction of the Guiyang Shuikousi Hydropower Plant, the Guizhou Provincial Department of Construction recently hired engineer Xu Kuannian from Shanghai to come to Guizhou to design it. After Xu arrived in the province, the director of the department, Ju Ren, accompanied engineer Xu, the director of the Electricity Bureau, Yu Pengsen, and the department's technical personnel, Hua Laifeng, Zhang Gengrong, Luo Youmei, Li Shuheng, Xie Zimei, and Li Yifeng, to Huangguoshu to conduct on-site surveys and measurements. As a result, according to engineer Xu's report, the Huangguoshu Waterfall has a head of 210 feet. The cross-section downstream of the waterfall is 137 feet wide, 9 feet at the deepest point, and the average flow rate is about 2 and 3/4 inches per second, resulting in a flow rate of 184 cubic feet per second. If water pipes are used to divert water to the turbine, it can generate 3,000 horsepower all day long. If the purpose is only to supply electricity for lighting and it is assumed to be used for ten hours a day, the water power can be increased to 7,200 horsepower. If electricity is sent to the place of use and it is still calculated as being used for ten hours a day, the actual usable power is about 3,700 kilowatts. Based on 40 light bulbs per kilowatt, the water power obtained during the measurement of Huangguoshu can light 150,000 bulbs.</p>
<h3 id="e90">XuZhou Disaster Victims Crowd <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou correspondence: Xubu suffered unusually severe flooding last summer. A flood relief association was established by various sectors to carry out relief efforts. However, after winter, as time passed, the authorities inevitably became less enthusiastic about disaster relief. Now, in the spring famine, there are many disaster victims in the area, especially in rural areas where transportation is inconvenient and food is scarce, leading to widespread starvation. In the urban areas, due to easier transportation, disaster victims from all directions have gathered, resulting in roads filled with displaced people. The Relief Branch Association has been handling relief distribution and has requested Mr. Zhu Ziqiao to allocate 100 tons of red grain. A few days ago, Mr. Zhu sent Zhang Yuting and Wang Guolin to transport it from Ping to Xuzhou. The Relief Branch Association is organizing investigations and distribution in the surrounding villages. The Xuzhou Red Swastika Society is also separately handling the distribution of flour, setting up porridge kitchens, and organizing price controls, but these efforts are like a drop in the bucket and difficult to make widespread. The Jinpu Railway Garrison Headquarters, concerned that the large number of disaster victims might affect public order, yesterday specifically instructed Chen Xueshun, the head of the military police and police department, and Yang Wei, the magistrate of Tongshan County, to quickly devise ways to eliminate the problem. The order stated, "Last year's floods affected various provinces, and disaster victims from all directions are displaced. Xuzhou is a strategic location, and more and more people are coming here. They are leading the old and carrying the young, begging for food from door to door, enduring the wind and dew. It's extremely tragic. Although there are relief organizations and charitable groups in Xuzhou City, they do not investigate and register the refugees' movements, nor do they find ways to send them away. The number of people increases daily without limit. Providing a fixed amount of relief grain to an unlimited number of refugees yields little effect and creates greater problems. Recently, refugees have gathered in the city, forming groups and begging from door to door. There are even starving people on the roads, which is not only unsightly but also inhumane. Those in charge of local administration should take immediate action. Moreover, as the number of displaced people increases daily, the weak are abandoned in ditches, which is pitiable, while the strong resort to desperate measures, which is likely to affect public order. If we do not quickly devise ways to eliminate this problem, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, we order the heads of the department and the county to jointly supervise the local police to conduct thorough investigations and registration of the number of refugees entering the area, and to convene relief organizations and charitable groups to earnestly discuss ways to accommodate, relieve, and send them away. This must be implemented within a specified period. Special attention should be paid to the repatriation aspect to ensure that disaster victims from all areas do not gather in one city, creating a hidden danger for the local area. We hereby set a deadline of five days from the receipt of this order to determine a solution, and ten days to implement it effectively. As this matter concerns local public order, the heads of the department and the county must work hard and take responsibility for handling it, and must not procrastinate or cause delays, which will incur punishment. They should also report on the progress of implementation at any time for verification." The two agencies, after receiving the order, immediately proceeded to handle the matter. However, while disaster relief requires the unreserved efforts of all parties, it is also important to address the root cause. Dredging rivers and using labor in place of relief were pre-planned by last year's flood relief association. Therefore, the local authorities should pay even more attention to this." (23rd)</p>

<p>People's Education Center Raises Aircraft Fund (Zhenjiang Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang People's Education Center, recognizing the urgent need to promote the aviation industry, and deeply affected by the severe damage caused by Japanese aircraft bombings during the recent invasion, is determined to catch up quickly. It aims to awaken the public and use national resources to purchase aircraft to assist the government. It has launched an initiative to raise funds for patriotic aircraft. It is reported that the third meeting of the center's administrative council resolved that all staff members would donate 3% of their monthly salaries starting from May to be saved as a fund, to take the lead in this. The fundraising matters for all sectors will be handled by the Promotion Committee. It is determined to raise funds in the shortest possible time to purchase the "Zhenjiang" aircraft as the first priority, and to promote and encourage people in all counties to follow suit.</p>
<p>Presenting Increased Salt Price to Cover Pacification Expenses (Yangzhou Correspondence) Nineteen gentlemen and elders from various counties north of the Yangtze River, including Han Zishi and Wang Jingting, today (23rd), in the name of representatives of various counties north of the Yangtze River, submitted a joint petition to the Ministry of Finance, the Salt Administration, the Lianghuai Salt Transport Commissioner, and the Huainan Salt Transport Deputy Commissioner, and the Songjiang Salt Administration. They generally stated that after the establishment of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Pacification Commissioner Zhang was stationed in Yangzhou and dispatched troops to suppress bandits in dozens of counties north of the Yangtze River, as well as the achievements of defending the dangerous dikes above Baoying during the autumn floods, which blessed our people. Now that there is talk of Pacification Commissioner Zhang requesting the dissolution of the office, they are all concerned that with the Shanghai situation unresolved, the people's hearts are unsettled after the floods, and there are many unemployed people, which would give bandits an opportunity to take advantage of. They specially visited the Pacification Commissioner to beg him to dispel this idea, only to learn that the central government's allocation of regular expenses was less than a quarter of what was needed, and the provincial allocation for bandit suppression has also been delayed for a long time. However, funds are the mother of facts. Therefore, after repeated consultations, they felt that the most universal and least burdensome way to raise funds would be to add five cents per stone of salt sold in Jiangsu Province to the tax, allowing it to be included in the selling price. This would be easy and convenient. Therefore, they petition to instruct merchants to implement this starting from May, and request approval to comply.</p>
<p>Another Japanese Aircraft Arrives in Taicang (Taicang Correspondence) Today (23rd) at 9:05 AM, a Japanese military aircraft arrived in Taicang, circled the city five times, and flew towards Kunshan. At 9:35 AM, another aircraft arrived, flying very low. The aircraft circled outside the North Gate three times and then flew towards the southwest.</p>
<p>All County District Chiefs Submit Collective Resignation (Changshu Correspondence) All fifteen district chiefs in this county have not received any district expenses since January of this year due to the impact of last year's floods. Now, with the arrival of a large army, they are feeling quite strained in terms of reception. Therefore, on the 20th, all the district chiefs came to the city and jointly petitioned the county government, requesting that the Finance Bureau be instructed to quickly return the more than 11,000 yuan owed since April. Subsequently, the county government summoned Finance Director Wang to discuss the matter. However, due to the poor harvest this year, it was impossible to prepare these district expenses. They then consulted with the banking community, but to no avail. Seeing that there was no hope of obtaining the funds, the district chiefs, led by Jin Ping, the chief of the first district, jointly submitted a collective resignation. After receiving the petition, County Magistrate Tan was quite alarmed. The next day, he entrusted Jin, the head of the first section, and others to find a way to mediate. He also invited leaders from the banking community to the county to discuss solutions. The district chiefs again petitioned the Finance Bureau, and had a heated exchange with Director Wang, even banging on the table before dispersing. After much deliberation, the Finance Bureau temporarily borrowed 5,000 yuan from the banking community and distributed it to the district chiefs on the afternoon of the 22nd, ending the wave of district chiefs demanding funds.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob Rice, One After Another Wuxi Correspondence: In the seventh district (Huai Shangshi) of the county, at the residence of Wang Toumao, a resident of Heshangqiao, about three miles south of Zhangjingqiao, who has always been engaged in farming, around 9:00 PM the other day, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came, broke down the door and entered the house. The four bandits tied Wang's hands behind his back, covered his eyes with white cloth, and locked him in a room. The remaining bandits looted extensively. As a result, more than ten stones of white rice were robbed. The next day, the house of Zhang Qibao in Yuejingwan Village in the same district was also visited by more than forty bandits, who robbed more than twenty stones of white rice and 106 yuan in silver dollars, but did not take clothes or other items. The faces of the bandits were covered with blue cloth, slightly revealing their eyes. It is said that they were generally poor people who, unable to borrow money, resorted to desperate measures.</p>

Later, the farm owner petitioned the authorities to issue a notice and ordered some of the beehives to be moved to Xilin Temple in the city. Recently, members of the new beekeeping cooperative have been communicating with all parties and have determined that Zhao Jiaqiao will be set up with more than two hundred Italian bee hives. The honey bees were scattered, collecting flower juice. The ignorant farmers believed that it harmed the plants. They rose up in opposition and questioned Cui, the director of the Xincun Cui Public Security Bureau. Director Cui was in a dilemma. The farmers, seeing that there was no solution, gathered thousands of people on the night of the other day, surrounded the bee farm, moved the beehives together, and planned to set them on fire. The local officials, fearing that it would cause trouble, rushed around to mediate. It is reported that the beekeeping cooperative has agreed to move elsewhere.</p>

<p>Large Businesses Close Down Due to the Impact of the Shanghai Incident Xiaoshan Correspondence: Xiaoyi is located in the center of Hangzhou and Shaoxing, and the commercial market has always been lively. However, the entry and exit of all goods depends entirely on the Hang-Hu Qianye for remittance. Since the beginning of this spring, the war in Shanghai has affected business completely, and business in Xiaoshan has completely stagnated. Xiaoshan has suffered financial panic, and the people have squeezed out silver dollars. Because businesses cannot operate smoothly, many have declared their closure. The Xiaoshan Guanghe Rice Store, Hengyuan Qianzhuang, Xiaoshan Pharmacy Deyuan Nanhuozhan, etc., are all old stores that have been in business for many years. Now they have also been affected by the financial situation and have announced their closure. There are still Gongyu and other miscellaneous goods stores that are also planning to auction off and close down. From now on, businesses will be hit by this blow, and most of them will not be able to continue to open for business.</p>
<p>The Tragic News of Bandits Tearing Up the Ticket Li Tugen, a resident of Shanghu Village in Ninghai North Township, is 65 years old and works as a barber. He has a little savings. Unexpectedly, on the night of the fourth day of the previous month, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came, broke down the door and entered the house, and tied him up. Later, his son negotiated with the bandits and redeemed him for 200 silver dollars, which were to be sent to the bandit's den, Kangjū Temple, on the 14th. When his son delivered 200 silver dollars on the 14th, the bandits suspected that his family had even more silver dollars because they were all silver dollars.</p>
<p>They insisted that his son send another 500 yuan in the near future before they would release his father. His son had no choice but to pay the silver dollars and wipe away his tears. The bandits waited until the 14th of this month without seeing the money delivered, and they angrily tore up the ticket, Li Tugen, at Lujing Jiao. His coffin was transported back by his son on the 18th.</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Rural Education Department of Lida High School Suffers a Terrible Robbery <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Losses Reach More Than 46,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The school buildings of Shanghai Lida Academy were originally divided into two parts. One was located on Lida Road in Jiangwan, Shanghai, for the junior high school and the general course of the high school. It was completely destroyed when the Japanese army attacked Jiangwan. Details have been published in various newspapers. The other was located in Nanxiang, Jiading, for the rural education department of the high school, located south of the Jinghu Railway, about seven miles away from the Nanxiang train station. It covers an area of more than 160 mu, with a fish pond of 25 mu in the middle. The school building is built next to the pond, with excellent scenery. To the northwest of the school building is a chicken farm, with four modern chicken coops that can raise more than 2,500 chickens. To the south of the school building is a bee farm, to the west is a cotton seed improvement area and a horticultural area, and the rest is wheat and rice fields. Usually, all production activities are operated by the student-teacher co-organized work-study society. In addition to raising chickens, bees, and fish, they also engage in cultivation. Therefore, the production gained is enough to meet the needs of students' learning. After our army changed its strategy and withdrew from the first line of defense, the Japanese army occupied Nanxiang. First, they slaughtered all the chickens, sheep, rabbits, and farming cattle raised by the school. The rice and wheat grains were looted. Then they destroyed the school building horizontally. The bee farm and bee colony were destroyed. According to an on-the-spot investigation, the storage room, shed, cattle shed, and grass shed north of the school building have been burned to the ground. The meeting hall, chicken feed room, kitchen, farm buildings, and farm tool room have all been pried open and destroyed. The bricks and tiles are in a mess, and the situation is very miserable. The chicken coops and greenhouses in the northwest of the school building have been dismantled, and the wood, glass, and wire mesh have all been transported away. The large and small boats and motor drain pumps parked in the schoolyard have all been robbed. The indoor utensils have been completely destroyed. Even the bamboo fences, doors, windows, and floors have not been spared. The total property loss has reached more than 46,000 yuan. The Academy founded the rural education department originally to improve rural culture and improve the lives of farmers. It was a long and arduous road, but it had just begun to take shape. It was planned to add a compulsory primary school to prevent poor young people in the vicinity from losing their schooling. How could the barbaric Japanese army have used all means to destroy our country's cultural institutions? The school was located in a remote rural area, but unfortunately suffered this terrible robbery.</p>

<h3 id="e99">International Shooting Finals First Half <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Medina Takes the Advantage</p>
<p>Score 1000 to 750</p>
<p>The Key to the Individual Championship Lies in the Second Half Today</p>
<p>Although Li Gongying Lost Momentum Yesterday, Hope for Victory Remains Shanghai International Advanced Shooting Competition, yesterday was the first day of the finals. At the beginning of the war, the Chinese Li Gongying made a smooth shot and was full of energy. However, it was only a fleeting moment and he was trapped below. He finally lost money to the Portuguese Medina by 750 to 1000. In the first game, 500 to 368, and in the second game, 500 to 382, the Portuguese took the lead. Yang Dina's huge numbers are 62, 34, 44, 39, 75, 71, 45, 33, 50, 76, a total of 92 hits, with an average of more than ten points per hit. Mr. Li's huge numbers are 37, 41, 56, 53, 38, 45, 34, 45, 91, 52. Today is the second day of the finals, and the competition is still divided into two games at 5:30 and 9:00. Although Mr. Li is currently losing momentum, the future is still optimistic, because Mr. Li's usual skills have not yet been fully utilized. Today, the goal of the two is 1,000 points for Medina and 1,250 points for Mr. Li, for a total of 2,000 points.</p>
<p>Medina Seizes the Opportunity to Take the Lead</p>
<p>In the first game, which started at 5:00, Medina missed the first shot and scored no points twice. Mr. Li continued to advance, adding 9, 19, and 37, and took the lead with 65 to 2. At this time of smooth sailing, he suddenly handled it improperly, giving others an opportunity. Medina took advantage of the situation and went straight up, soon surpassing him in front with 149 to 78. Mr. Li had two huge numbers of 41 and 56, and the difference in score was only one point (223 to 224). This was the closest score in the first game, and the closer ones were 310 to 319. In addition, the distance was always around 100 points. After Medina added two huge numbers of 75 and 71, Mr. Li was disappointed. The score in the first half was 500 to 368.</p>
<p>Li Gongying Is Far Behind</p>
<p>In the second game, which started at 9:00 and ended at 11:30, Medina was about to lose the opportunity. It was a pity that Mr. Li did not make good use of it. The distance between the two was often within 150 points. After 15 shots, Mr. Li failed to score five times in a row, which was a fatal injury that was difficult to get rid of later. In short, Medina was as calm as usual, and almost every shot was not empty. Mr. Li was cramped and uneasy, and his actions were out of place. The God of Fortune said goodbye again. Therefore, the difference in distance gradually became farther and farther, and disappointment set in at 580 to 940.</p>
<p>Mr. Li suddenly made an amazing move, scoring 91 points in one shot, creating the largest score of the day. At that time, he was determined to do something, but the timing was too slow, and he was far behind. Medina took the lead with 1,000 points to 750 points.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Department Approves Flexibility in Sugar Tax <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Result of Representatives Going to Beijing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, previously due to the Jianghai Customs announcement, following an order from the Ministry of Finance, to implement new sugar tax rates starting April 1st, and using polarimetric testing as the standard for classification. The industry had previously ordered 500,000 dan of red and white sugar from Java and other places for February and March. Due to the Shanghai war, following the Chamber of Commerce's notice, letters were sent to various foreign firms to delay loading. Therefore, only partial shipments have not yet returned to Shanghai. If the newly established tax rates are applied, there would be a sudden increase of more than four taels. The sugar for which foreign firms were asked to delay loading would, after arriving in Shanghai, incur more tax than before, which is truly difficult to bear in the current situation. Moreover, the new tax regulations have as many as fourteen categories, with tax rates differing by as much as two yuan per dan of customs duty, making it complex, cumbersome, and unbearable. Sugar taxes worldwide, in East Asian countries, mostly use the Dutch standard for classification. Although European and American countries use degrees as the basis, they only differentiate between raw materials and finished products, with absolutely no division into as many as fourteen categories. It was requested that the classification standard be changed to one category for below 90 degrees, one category for 91 to 96 degrees, and another category for above 97 degrees, etc. This was submitted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting adoption and implementation. Subsequently, the association further stated that if the Ministry of Finance increased the sugar tax to protect domestic sugar, then the quantity of sugar produced in our country has decreased in recent years, and is not even sufficient to supply one corner of the country, relying entirely on imported goods to make up the difference. Moreover, sugar is needed for flavoring and cooking, and has become a necessary item for the people. The floods have just subsided, followed by the Japanese disaster. Increasing the sugar tax will only make the people's livelihood more difficult. In terms of commerce, the sugar trade has very thin profits, with peacetime earnings only reaching five per thousand. This time, the 500,000 dan of sugar with delayed loading will require additional tax payments. According to established practice on the foreign firm side, foreign taxes are usually borne externally. When the sugar industry resells to trading houses, it includes the tax. This kind of newly increased tax is truly impossible to recoup. Moreover, there are many categories of imported goods, but the increase only applies to the sugar tax. The value of each dan of white sugar is only about six taels, but the tax is as high as more than eight taels. No other goods have such a heavy tax. Upon the request of the sugar industry, the standing committee meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce publicly appointed Standing Committee member Wang Yansong, along with industry representative Zheng Zenan and others, to go to Beijing to present the actual situation to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, requesting a temporary suspension of implementation. The petition representatives have completed their work and returned to Shanghai last night. It is heard that the relevant departments and courts have all understood the difficulties of the sugar industry and agreed to make adjustments. As for the report in yesterday's newspaper stating that the Ministry of Finance had not approved the extension, it was still a reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's telegram before the petition representatives arrived in Beijing, and not the result of the representatives' petition, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Department Regarding Electricity Fees <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Electricity Fees Should Be Based on Actual Usage</p>
<p>Deposit Reduced by One-Third</p>
<p>The Shanghai Settlement Taxpayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the Secretary of the Public Works Department, stating: "Dear Sir, According to Wang Xinfu's letter, the electricity bill for this month from the power company states that 12 degrees of electricity were used, totaling three taels, seven mace, and five fen of silver, etc. According to this calculation, the power company has clearly implemented a measure to increase the minimum monthly electricity fee by two times. Recently, we have seen in the newspapers that your association is negotiating with the Public Works Department regarding this matter. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to inquire whether our electricity fee should be paid according to the new rate before the negotiations are properly handled. We also request that your association first send a letter to the Public Works Department, instructing them to immediately inform the power company that for all users who delay payment due to the unresolved issue, the electricity supply should not be cut off, to avoid inconvenience, etc." After investigation, regarding the new electricity fee regulations, this association has sent a letter requesting rectification. According to the letter, the electricity fee for 12 degrees should only be one tael and four mace and four fen of silver based on the current rate. Now, it is required to pay three taels, seven mace, and five fen of silver, which means that people are bearing an obligation of two taels and three mace and one fen of silver without any rights. This kind of new regulation causes ordinary people to suffer uncompensated losses. If calculated by ten thousand households, the Shanghai Power Company can obtain 23,100 taels of silver per month without providing electricity, and 277,200 taels of silver per year. At seven mace and two fen per national currency, it would be 385,000 yuan. This kind of new regulation is unreasonable in terms of legal principles and has drawbacks in reality. Furthermore, the French Concession's electricity fees are based on actual usage, with no so-called minimum fee. We truly do not know why your bureau approved this kind of regulation. Moreover, recently, the Shanghai Power Company has changed to collecting electricity fees once a month, unlike when your bureau handled it, collecting every three months. Why is the deposit not immediately refunded by two-thirds? In other words, why is the deposit collected based on more than one month's estimated usage? This association believes that the above two methods benefit the company and harm the users, which is contrary to legal principles and lacks a basis for fairness. Accordingly, we send this letter requesting that the Shanghai Power Company promptly change these new regulations: (1) Electricity fees should be based on actual usage; (2) The deposit should be reduced to one-third as before when it was collected every three months. We hope you will investigate and handle accordingly."</p>

<p>The Wu Song yellow croaker (i.e., spring fish) season is a major business every year. All fishing boats entering the port are handled by Bao Feng, Cui Sheng, and Shen Tai, the three major firms for distribution. The annual sales are estimated to be worth millions of gold. This year, the business locations of these three fish firms were destroyed by artillery fire, making it difficult to restore them immediately. Initially, there were plans to relocate to Shanghai for business, but due to various difficulties and the inconvenience of the fishing boats traveling back and forth, the three firms decided to establish a joint office in Wu Song (located at 29 Guizhi Road) to temporarily maintain business. Yesterday morning, three large fishing boats, Guang Zeng Shun, Zuo Zeng Mao, and Xu Zeng Sheng, entered the port. In the afternoon, the customs inspected the boats, and the cargo can be unloaded and sold starting today. It is heard that the cargo entering yesterday was distributed by Bao Feng firm, with a fixed price of six yuan and sixty-four cents per 80 jin, approximately twelve jin per yuan. Fish firms in Shanghai and Hakka customers in the interior have already sent personnel to Wu Song to purchase in bulk.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, businesses have been suspended, and residents of the war zone have been displaced. Although various charitable organizations have been providing relief every day, if this continues for a long time, tens of thousands of disaster victims will not be engaged in production, which is ultimately not beneficial for society. Recently, enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life have organized the War Zone Refugee Relief Association, dedicated to discussing ways to maintain the livelihoods of refugees and methods for education and post-disaster recovery. It is understood that the association has already been established, with a temporary office located at 4 Remy Lane, Remy Fang, No. 4. Currently, they are actively recruiting members.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Cross-Border Road Construction Telephone Problems <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Decision to Eliminate Toll for Communication Between Chinese and Settlement Concessions</p>
<p>The telephones on the Shanghai West cross-border roads were installed by the former China and Germany Telephone Company because the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications lacked lines. The contract expired on December 16, 1930. Subsequently, temporary contracts were renewed with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Municipal Public Utility Bureau. However, these will also expire at the end of June this year. Last year, the three parties, the Telephone Bureau, the Public Utility Bureau, and the Telephone Company, negotiated the renewal issue after the contract expired. However, the Public Works Department of the Public Settlement opposed a certain item, and no results were achieved. At the end of last year, the Public Utility Bureau sent a letter urging the company to discuss the matter again as soon as possible, and it was scheduled to be held on January 14th. However, it was postponed due to the Sino-Japanese issue. Director Wei of the Telephone Bureau believes that June is approaching in the blink of an eye, and the renewal issue must be resolved immediately. Therefore, he has consulted the Public Utility Bureau to urge the company to schedule a meeting. Mr. Wei also plans to first consult with the Public Utility Bureau on all matters today. In addition, telephone users in the Chinese and Settlement Concessions must register in advance for communication, and pay a communication fee of five cents per call. The procedure is also very complicated. Mr. Wei has decided to come up with a proper method to eliminate the need for registration and payment of communication fees, as well as the cumbersome procedures, in order to benefit users and expedite communication. It is predicted that after implementation, the telephone business will definitely develop rapidly.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association has a long-standing reputation for social services. During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, they were enthusiastic in providing relief to refugees in the war zone, sparing no effort. However, the association faced financial difficulties. Therefore, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM yesterday (the 26th), a display exhibition was held at the association's foreign branch at 22 Nanjing Road. The exhibition was initiated by Jin Mao Yunqin and featured velvet-woven birds and animals, children's supplies, knitted French beauties with lifelike forms, and handmade simulated fresh flowers (including both Chinese and foreign styles).

<h3 id="e109">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Reduced Tax Collection for Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Ministry of Finance and the Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol yesterday, stating: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol: On the 25th of this month, the Shanghai Tobacco Industry, Fen Wine Industry, Shaoxing Wine Industry, and Tobacco Leaf Industry Associations jointly stated in a letter that due to the impact of the Shanghai war, commerce has been suspended. Our association has jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance and the Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol, requesting exemption from the summer tobacco and alcohol license tax for this year to alleviate the difficulties of businesses, etc. The ministry replied that after investigating, Shangbao County experienced commercial impact due to the war, which is a fact. However, tobacco and alcohol licenses are taxes levied on business operations. All tobacco and alcohol shops, except those that are closed and exempt from taxation, should follow the regulations and obtain licenses. There is no precedent for exemption due to circumstances, and the request cannot be approved. Please take note of this reply. The provincial bureau also replied, stating that the impact of the war is only temporary, and the request to exempt the summer license tax cannot be approved. Please take note of this reply. We received this reply after a little over a month. The spring tax collection period began on January 1st, and most (70-80 percent) had already completed their tax payments before the January 28th incident occurred. The businesses were only operating for slightly over one month before the incident. Moreover, it is customary to settle accounts at the end of the year, and people have been displaced and are suffering greatly. Although some are forced to reopen their businesses now, they have been idle for a long time, and their capital has been depleted. Some hope to collect accounts receivable to prepare for closure, while others are working hard to maintain the business to feed their families. They cannot stop if they want to. In the end, business is still bleak. Under these circumstances, it would not be excessive for the government to show love for the people and issue currency to provide relief. Our association does not dare to make this request because we are well aware of the inadequate state of the national treasury. Therefore, we only request exemption from the summer license tax. Unexpectedly, the Ministry of Finance believes that there is no precedent to follow and refuses to approve the request. However, the Japanese invasion is also an extraordinary event. Merchants would not complain unless they were truly in dire straits. Alas, our merchants have no way to complain, and the tax collectors have a superficial view, thinking that since the shops have reopened, they are sending out tax collectors everywhere to intimidate and scare people under the guise of heavy national taxes. They do not ask about the content of the business or anything else. They only know how to drain the pond to catch all the fish, regardless of the people's plight. It is also heard that the spring tax collected by the bureau did not reach three-tenths of the original amount submitted to the province. Why is the government favoring the contractors (i.e., the tax collectors) while being harsh on the merchants after the disaster? Our association witnesses the difficulties of the merchants and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specially send this letter to your bureau for review and request that you forward it to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Finance's Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol. Since it is difficult to completely waive all taxes, please allow reduced tax collection so that both national taxes and business conditions can be taken care of. Once the overall situation returns to normal, it will still be handled according to the previous regulations, etc. According to this, since the merchants in Shangbao County have been affected by the war since the January 28th incident, the stagnation of their tobacco and alcohol business is a fact that cannot be concealed. Such an extraordinary event, those in charge of taxation should not be stubborn due to lack of precedent, and insist on scraping. Furthermore, according to reports, the spring tax submitted to the province is less than 30% of the full amount. The provincial treasury has limited income, but the tax collection bureau is still taxing as usual, giving it an opportunity to profit. Why is the government better to them than to the merchants? Now, after the merchant had requested exemption for the summer license tax, it was not approved. As such, they are forced to ask for reduced tax, and it is stated that once the overall situation returns to normal, the regulations will still be followed as normal. They are taking public tax collection into account, even while asking for reduced burden. Your ministry and bureau should be considerate of the businesses and no longer reject them on set rules, which will leave them voiceless. We request this in the telegram and hope it will be approved, as it will be for public convenience. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Memorial Service to be Held at the Jade Buddha Temple on the 30th</p>
<p>Shen Zhuowu, manager of the China Evening News, unfortunately encountered an accident on the Dada Company's Dade ship while heading to Jiangbei to preside over disaster relief efforts last year at Qiwangsha. It has been over one hundred and thirty days. Suddenly, the remains were found on the shore, notifying the Chonghai Qiwu County Association and Shen's relatives. Shen's family members were filled with both sorrow and joy, and could not bear to have the remains exposed for any longer. Hastily, the coffin was entombed at the Five County Assembly Hall on Xietu Road yesterday morning, and there was no time to invite friends and relatives widely. Thus, close friends Zheng Hongnian, Zhang Zhenxi, Wang Hanliang, Sun Zhenwu, Cai Jianqing, etc., and fellow villagers in Shanghai, recognizing Shen's service to society for more than twenty years, leaving behind an elderly mother and young children in impoverished circumstances, the sound of weeping was deafening at the time of the entombment. The Shen Zhuowu Funeral Office has been set to hold a memorial service at the Jade Buddha Temple on the 30th. Shen's relatives and friends also plan to discuss all funeral arrangements and aftercare.</p>

<p>Kidnappers and Japanese Soldiers Exchange Fire</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 25th) morning, there was a sudden incident in Zhabei Qiujiang Road in which kidnappers and Japanese soldiers exchanged gunfire. It is heard that the victim, Chen Ruiwu (transliteration), is the owner of a restaurant on Suzhou Road and was shot and injured. As for the details, a reporter inquired with Japanese officers yesterday, and it was claimed that no detailed report has been received yet. However, according to the investigation by the Continental Daily, at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Chen was on his way to visit a friend on Qiujiang Road when suddenly seven bandits came forward, grabbed him into a car, and rushed to Zhabei via North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road. When passing Qiujiang Road, the Japanese soldiers ordered the car to stop for questioning. The driver answered in Japanese, claiming to be returning to his residence in Zhabei, and was released. Chen, seeing the situation, immediately cried for help. The Japanese soldiers shouted at the car to stop, but the driver accelerated and sped forward. At the same time, two bandits in the car opened fire on the Japanese soldiers, and the Japanese soldiers returned fire. It is believed that the driver was hit, as the car suddenly stopped. One bandit jumped from the rear to the front and pushed the driver away, taking over the wheel and driving away. Chen was seen attempting to escape, but was shot by a bandit and fell into the car. At this time, the Japanese soldiers continued to chase and fire, firing a total of more than forty bullets. However, due to the car's extreme speed, it eventually escaped. It is claimed that the car has a Zhabei business license plate number.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Anhui Review Monthly Magazine, founded by Anhui natives in Shanghai, telegraphed Wu Zhongxin, etc., stating: "To Wu, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, Luo, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, He, Director of the Department of Finance, Cheng, Director of the Department of Construction, and all members including Zhang Wujiangguang: Our Anhui is suffering from harsh taxes. Placed in a state of misery, the people have been exhausted. Anhui people have been making rescue efforts in the province for years, exhausting their minds and efforts, hoping to relieve the distress. Last winter, the joint office of various Anhui associations abroad published a notice to the Anhui people, stating that all taxes and illegal levies created by Chen Diaoyuan should not be paid. The paper was full of agitation, hoping to solicit attention and correction. Now, fortunately, the central government cares about the people and has specially appointed you to return to Anhui to govern. At first, it was thought that you would surely reverse what Chen Diaoyuan had done and first abolish all illegal harsh taxes to alleviate the people's difficulties. Recently, on the 24th of this month, a Shanghai newspaper reported that Anhui Province's special business taxes on bamboo, wood, tea, hemp, silk, cocoons, food, oil, cotton, paper, and other categories will not be discontinued due to the reorganization of the provincial government, and will not be ceased despite merchants' opposition. Upon investigation, this kind of special tax is more harmful than Likin. As many as twenty-seven bureaus have been established. The extraction tax is layered, and the tax rate is as high as twenty to fifty per thousand, calculated on quantity and value. How can merchants bear this? At a time when bandits and communists are rampant and all industries are depressed, if we continue to collect taxes, then Chen Diaoyuan created it, and you will enjoy its success. It is foreseeable that production will be slow and sales will be difficult, and the people will be increasingly impoverished. The three thousand people of Anhui will not die under the military warlord's boots, but instead will die under the hands of Anhui people governing Anhui. You love your hometown, how can you bear to do this? We specially send this telegram and respectfully request that you resolutely abolish the taxes to console the people's expectations. We earnestly express our request, awaiting your order. Shanghai Anhui Review Monthly Magazine."</p>

<p>The local taxi association had requested that the Public Works Department allow taxis to park near theaters, restaurants, and hotels, because public buses had already been granted the right to park near cinemas. Recently, the Deputy Secretary of the Public Works Department replied to the association, stating that public buses drive after the end of performances at the Picardie, New Light, and Guangling theaters, and park at designated locations, not at the entrance of the theaters. This is to provide cheap fares for the public, so it does not affect the business of taxis. In addition, there are taxi companies near each of these theaters. If other companies are allowed to park outside the theaters and solicit passengers, then these companies will definitely protest first. The space required for public buses to park three vehicles near the theaters is not much. Public buses must also operate in an orderly manner and not honk their horns to attract customers. If taxis are allowed to gather at entertainment venues, then the drivers and their assistants will inevitably honk their horns excessively, which will disturb the public, and it will be extremely difficult for the police to manage. Therefore, the Public Works Department does not want to approve the request.</p>

<p>The Tragic Situation is Unbearable to Read</p>
<p>The local Chinese Jisheng Society reports that, according to Zhai Fengxiang, director of the Anhui disaster relief office in southern Anhui, the disaster situation in Xuan Cheng, Fanchang, Nanling, and other counties is extremely severe. Although the disaster situation was relieved via our associations and the Emergency Water Disaster Association, since the beginning of spring, people have been starving to death. Root bark and tree bark have been eaten completely. There was a case where several dozen copper coins were given to a young child to buy food on the street, while the entire family committed suicide by poison. The situation of tragic deaths in various counties and villages is everywhere and endless. According to reports from Wuhu, the average disaster victim is unable to feed their fill or cover their body. They barely maintain their lives. They lack the oxen to plow and have no seeds to sow. In the past, they could sell their wives and children, but now, there is no one to ask about wives and children. They will either starve to death. There is no way to live and no solution to be found. According to reports, in Gaoxing village of the west ling section of Siyang County, Jiangsu, a family of thirteen committed suicide because they ran out of food and had no way to borrow. In addition, the director of the Henan relief office of the association, after returning to Shanghai from Henan, stated that the tragic disaster in southern Henan, etc., the villagers were starving and unable to bear it. The wheat has been exhausted, and the wheat harvest is hopeless. There is no place to die and those who are not going to risk it are few, and so on. Other demands for relief are coming in like snowflakes and cannot be met. The disaster situation is extremely severe after the local war. There are disaster victims everywhere in Taicang, Liuhe, Kunshan, Changshu, etc. Relief is not enough. The higher refugee, without food or clothing, is scattering. In addition to the shelters that have been temporarily allocated, there are countless awaiting rescue. The disaster in other provinces and counties is like this. The disaster near this port is like that. During this great calamity, deaths follow in quick succession. I hope people can make up their minds to save money and all kinds of expenses in order to save the disaster and clear up the hidden dangers.</p>

<p>Tang Shenyu Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>In October of the 19th year of the Republic of China, Chen Zhusun, Tang Shenyu, Zhu Yougui, and four others raised 20,000 yuan to open the Zhenda Company at 392 Nanjing Road, specializing in stocks and government bonds. Tang and Zhu served as the general manager and deputy general manager, respectively. After starting operations, Tang and Zhu privately established four accounts under the names Yuji, Boji, Wenji, and Baoji, engaging in excessive trading, resulting in significant losses over the years. They secretly sold all the bonds deposited by customers with Zhenda Company to cover the losses. Recently, as the losses increased and could not be sustained, Zhu fled, and Zhenda Company went bankrupt. It is currently being liquidated.  Tang Shenyu, upon the company's bankruptcy, reported to shareholder Chen Zhusun, who hired lawyer Wu Linkun to report to the Lao Zha Police Station. Western detective Hao'er and Chinese detective Lang Chengpei arrested Tang. Qing Qingren, the company's bookkeeper, Li Tairan, was also arrested as a suspect in the joint malfeasance.  Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station and attorney Wu Linkun, representing Chen Zhusun, successively stated that the defendants jointly concealed accounts and embezzled public funds amounting to 466,115.35 yuan. However, this was the amount admitted by the defendants and only a rough estimate. The actual amount may not be determined for some time.  When questioned, the defendant Tang Shenyu confessed that Zhu Yougui, who is still at large, was the instigator of the matter. Li Tairan claimed to have no involvement. Judge Zhou Hanting reviewed the confessions and sentenced Tang to two years imprisonment. Li was found not guilty. Detention will continue during the appeal period. The ancillary civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Division for trial.</p>

<p>Police Officer Luo Bin Remanded</p>
<p>The Case is Scheduled for Sentencing</p>
<p>Police officer Luo Bin of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, on the night of the 13th of this month, sought bean curd jelly to warm himself at the bean curd shop opened by Li Wenqing at 12 Kangjia Lane, Xiaodongmen. He had a quarrel with the shop assistant Liang Zaifu, who was from Chongming. In a fit of anger, Luo repeatedly struck Liang in the lower body with the barrel of his gun, injuring his kidney sinews. At that time, Luo was seized and escorted to the First District, Second Precinct and then to the District Court, where the injury was confirmed. Prosecution was initiated, but unexpectedly, Liang's injuries proved fatal. He died in hospital without responding to treatment. After further examination by the court, the nature of the charges were amended and yesterday morning, Judge Qian Chengjun held a court hearing. The defendant Luo Bin stated that he did not know Liang Zaifu. At three o'clock on the night of the 13th, while eating bean curd jelly, he struck Liang with the butt of his gun because the deceased had cursed him first. He did not expect the injury to be so severe, and it was too late for regrets. He had only been a policeman for two months, and he had no hatred for the deceased, and he did not act deliberately. Li Wenqing, the owner of the bean curd shop, stated that Luo Bin was a patron, and there was no hatred between him and the deceased. At three o'clock on the night of the 13th, the defendant came to eat bean curd jelly. When apprentice Shi Ruilang replied that it was not ready yet, the defendant hit the apprentice on the head. Liang Zaifu came to advise, saying that people should treat each other politely. He then struck Liang Yaofu with his gun. I was already asleep at the time, and Shi Ruilang and others told me about it afterwards. Liang died in Guangci Hospital at four o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th. Shi Ruilang stated that he was an apprentice. There were two shop assistants in the shop, one was Shi Ruiqing, and the other was Liang Zaifu. The police officer came to eat bean curd jelly and asked me for it. I said it wasn't ready and immediately slapped me. Liang Zaifu then said that other brothers were polite, why were you unreasonable? He then struck Liang Zaifu on the left side of his lower body with his gun. The second time Liang grabbed it, dragged him outside, and slapped him twice, etc. Shi Ruiqing stated that he was a bean curd shop assistant, and the rest was the same as what Shi Ruiqing said. The judge then asked if he was taken to the police station at that time, and answered that martial law was in effect at that time, and the police were not called until the next day. At this point, Prosecutor Yang was invited to the court to state his opinion. Appointed defense lawyer Hu Yuanjun defended according to precedent. The court then announced the conclusion of the debate, scheduled the sentencing for a later date, and remanded the defendant.</p>

<p>Plans to Create a Civilian Hospital</p>
<p>After the start of the Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai, the people in the rear engaged in relief and assistance, and many military hospitals were organized and established for medical treatment. In addition to the wounded soldiers who have fully recovered and been discharged, there are still many who have not recovered and remain in the hospital. It is learned that in order to unify the organization of military hospitals, the central government decided to establish three large-scale military hospitals in Bengbu, Wuxi, and Hangzhou, and to concentrate the soldiers wounded in the anti-Japanese war in these three hospitals for medical treatment. It is stipulated that the wounded soldiers in Shanghai and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road area will be treated in the Hangzhou Military Hospital. The wounded soldiers along the Beijing-Shanghai Road will be treated in the Wuxi Military Hospital. The wounded soldiers along the Jinpu Road will be treated in the Bengbu Military Hospital. The relocation has now begun separately. The original military hospitals in Shanghai will be closed in sequence depending on the situation of each hospital. Some people believe that it is a pity to abandon the equipment and medicines prepared by the military hospitals. Shanghai also feels the lack of civilian hospitals. Therefore, it is planned to initiate the organization of a civilian hospital and transfer all the equipment of the military hospitals to the civilian hospital for application. It is truly a win-win situation and is currently being planned. (Far East News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e126">Argument Concluded in the Case of a Daughter-in-Law Biting Her Mother-in-Law <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for May 3</p>
<p>Old woman, Huang, a local resident of a flat in Kangjili Lane, Kanti Road, French Concession, is sixty years old this year. Her daughter, Cui Bao, also known as A Liu, is twenty-seven years old and works in the Maya Silk Weaving Factory. She has been in love with the company's accountant, Chen Qiao, for more than two years. Recently, they asked a matchmaker to arrange a marriage, and it was agreed that they would be married on the 11th of this month. Huang prepared generous wedding clothes, dowry, and ornaments for her daughter, worth more than 800 gold. Huang's eldest daughter-in-law, Ye Zhang, nicknamed "The Tigress," was jealous that her mother-in-law was spending huge sums of money to marry off her daughter. On the 7th of this month, she extorted 3,000 yuan from her mother-in-law without success, and harbored resentment. At ten o'clock that night, she sneaked into the room while Huang was asleep and bit Huang's lower body six times, biting off two pieces of skin and flesh, one of which had been dragged away and eaten by rats. Not satisfied, she burned more than 50 pieces of her young daughter-in-law Cui Bao's wedding clothes the next morning. Cui Bao reported to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Zhang and seize the ash of the clothes, and escorted her to the Second Special District Court. The police prosecuted her for the crimes of injuring a close relative and damaging property under Articles 293, 298, and 382 of the Criminal Law. The case was detained in the detention hall for investigation. Details have been recorded in previous reports. Neighbors Lu Wenbing, Zhu Wang, Sun Yongxing, and Song Guojun all testified in court in this case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang 　Xu and Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke visited the First Criminal Court for a continued hearing. They first interrogated both parties. According to Ye Cui Bao, her elder sister-in-law injured her mother and burned her wedding clothes. She requested an investigation and compensation for the clothes, etc. The defendant still denied it in every possible way. The court ordered the debate to begin. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi argued that the defendant's crime in this case can be divided into two points: first, injuring a close relative, biting her mother-in-law's lower body six times; second, damaging her young daughter-in-law's wedding clothes. All witnesses have testified in court, and she should be punished according to the law. The defendant's side initially hired lawyer Peng Qixiu to defend, but Peng appeared in court yesterday and announced the termination of the mandate. Dong Banggan was temporarily hired as a defense lawyer. Subsequently, the prosecutor made a statement, stating that the defendant's crime was in line with items 1-7 of Article 20 of the Criminal Law, and the judge should make a judgment in accordance with Article 294 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Finally, the attorney Ye Fokan, representing the plaintiff, supplemented his reference to the Criminal Law. The court declared the debate concluded, scheduled sentencing for May 3, and remanded the defendant.</p>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the report of the Shibo (申報) newspaper, we, the World and China Society (世界與中國社), would like to clarify that the Wuxi Correspondent (無錫通訊) article on April 20 stated that "Ms. Tao Fanggu (陶方榖女士) was arrested after the post office found a copy of the World and China (世界與中國) magazine" (世界與中國雜誌), which led to her arrest. However, according to the facts, and according to the Shibo (時報) newspaper on April 10 and the Great Evening News (大晚報) newspaper on April 23, it was "China and the World" (中國與世界) that was found, not "World and China" (世界與中國). We checked and found "China and the World" (中國與世界) in the market and it is a small weekly magazine, while our magazine is published monthly with 100,000 to 200,000 words in each issue. The content and format are completely different. Moreover, our magazine is registered with the Ministry of Interior of the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government, and has been reviewed and approved by the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. The arguments are accurate and have always been praised by all parties. There is no suspicion of being reactionary. We are only concerned about the reputation and business development, so we specially commissioned your lawyer to send a letter to you, asking you to correct it immediately, so as not to mix things up and harm the business. We hope you will consider it, and please check and correct it. Sincerely, Shanghai News Agency Editor, Lawyer Chen Zhigao, April 25.</p>

<p>The Trend Remains Unstable</p>
<p>Creating an Unprecedented Record</p>
<p>Recently, the price of foreign silver has been plunging since mid-month when it once fell to a low of 7 qian and 2 li. The authorities tried to raise the price, and tea merchants made some purchases, so it stabilized for the past ten days or so. In the past few days, due to weak confidence and sluggish sales, prices have continued to fall, surpassing the previous low. Yesterday afternoon, it actually approached the 7 qian mark, showing the courage to break through this mark, which is an unusual change in the market. Even the most experienced people have never heard of this situation before. The early market price yesterday was 7 qian and 1 li 5 hao, which was 2 hao 5 li lower than the previous day, causing alarm in the outside world. In the afternoon market, it suddenly fell another 1 li 2 hao 5 li, reaching only 7 qian and 0 li 2 hao 5 li, setting a new record low, which is definitely not a good thing for business. The amount of remittance drafts made was 745,000 in the morning market and 365,000 in the afternoon market.

The amount of silver public bills received and delivered was more than 31 million. The amount of foreign headline funds received and delivered was more than 1.4 million. The amount of silver headline funds received and delivered was more than 2.7 million. The amount of various receipts and deliveries from banks was about 2.78 million for Chinese merchants and more than 4.2 million for foreign merchants. The amount of receipts and deliveries of various goods, exchange, mortgage, customs duties, special funds, and foreign funds was more than 5.78 million. The amount of small money house transactions was more than 400,000. The market price of supplementary coins followed the downstream trend of foreign silver. The price of Jiangnan small foreign coins and Guangdong small foreign coins was the same at 6 qian and 1 li 7 hao 5 li in the early market, which was about 2 li lower than the afternoon market of the previous day. The afternoon market was 6 qian and 0 li 5 hao, which was 1 li 2 hao 5 li lower than the early market. The price of Jiang and Guang coins remained the same. The amount of Jiang coins made was 1,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The amount of 　　coins was 120,000 jiao in the morning market and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins increased by 1,500 wen, to 417,000 wen.

<p>Both markets experienced slight fluctuations.</p>
<p>Complex international financial situation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American exchange rates plummeted. The trend was almost the opposite of HSBC's quoted prices. British gold should increase by one tick (0.25), at 1 shilling and 8 pence.

The pound initially weakened and then stabilized. It seemed weak in the afternoon. The result was an increase of 0.375 compared to the day before, with a total turnover of about 100,000 pounds. Most gold dealers were bullish. The US dollar was stable in the morning and then weakened. It returned to level at noon and trended weaker in the afternoon, still up 0.125 from the previous day. Normally, exchange rates should tighten after a sharp drop, but this was not the case yesterday, hence the potential for gold prices to fall. The total turnover for the day was about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, with more selling than buying. There were many hedging transactions. In short, the international financial situation is very complex. Today (April 27th), the major players are expected to be bullish.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Cotton Yarn Exchange Council <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Proposed six conditions</p>
<p>The Brokers Guild is still discussing items 1, 2, 6, and 3. The Cotton Yarn Exchange Brokers Guild received the six proposals from the council and convened a meeting at 3 PM yesterday to discuss them. Regarding the first proposal to increase special certificates for cotton yarn, it is difficult to comply. However, subsequently, the guarantee deposit should be changed to half cash and half substitutes. Regarding the second item, increasing commissions, this should be postponed due to the difficult times of national crisis. Regarding the sixth item, the cotton yarn grading table,</p>
<p>The appraisal period was previously checked every six months, now changed to three months, and a majority decision has not been reached. The above three items are still under discussion. The six conditions are attached below: (1) The market will open on May 2nd. However, for the sake of business safety, both buyers and sellers of cotton yarn should uniformly pay a special certificate cash deposit of 6 taels, and cotton should uniformly pay a special certificate cash deposit of 2 taels.</p>
<p>(2) It is proposed to increase handling fees after the market opens.</p>
<p>(3) The method of collecting guarantee deposits according to grade, which was previously drafted, is now planned to be implemented when the market opens.</p>
<p>(4) Improve handling procedures: A. Standardize forms, B. Organize the market, C. Facilitate procedures, D. Please cooperate in handling matters.</p>
<p>(5) This time, the reopened market will feature futures contracts, with terms temporarily from July to October, totaling four months. Cotton will be traded for seven, eight, and thirteen months.</p>
<p>(6) In order to improve the cotton yarn grading table appraisal period, the subsequent futures contract grading table will only specify the most recent three months.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Yarn Sales Only 450 Bales <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>20-count "Ren Zhong" yarn has fallen 18.5 taels from its peak.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is increasingly sluggish, and the situation is very loose. Business is quiet everywhere because of the unstable situation, tight credit, and difficult commercial activity. The goods from inland yarn factories are being shipped to Shanghai one after another, indicating the coolness of trade. Foreign yarn has also seen a sharp drop. There is no vibrancy along the Yangtze River, and there are many stockpiles in Hankou. The North China region is occupied by Japanese yarn. According to Tianjin brokerage firms, Japanese goods flood the market there, and prices are extremely accommodating, leaving no room for Chinese yarn. Therefore, judging from the overall situation, the future is still difficult to be optimistic about. However, continuous declines have already caused a considerable drop. 20-count "Ren Zhong" yarn has fallen 18.5 taels from its peak. The downward trend may temporarily stop. According to some, the rainfall in the four rural areas of Geng is still relatively even this year, and sales may improve later. In short, the unstable situation and stagnant finance are major obstacles to the yarn market. It is found that all firms bought a total of 450 bales throughout the day. Among them, fellow merchants bought 15 bales. Prices fell again by 0.05 to 0.1 taels. Ningbo buyers bought 20 bales, Tianjin buyers bought 110 bales, Shantou buyers bought 50 bales, Changsha buyers bought 20 bales, North China buyers bought 60 bales, inland buyers bought 65 bales, Wuhu buyers bought 5 bales. Shenxin factories are still releasing small quantities.</p>

<p>Factories have no demand</p>
<p>The cotton market is quiet. There is no demand for spot cotton. Various mills are very hesitant about procuring raw materials because the yarn market's downward trend has not stopped, and US cotton is flat. However, the stock of foreign cotton in Japanese warehouses in Shanghai is still thick, while local cotton inventories are weak, and sources from all regions are still depleted.</p>

<p>Slight fluctuations in British and Egyptian cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was mixed. It was initially weak due to long position liquidations, then firmed up due to buying by peers. The price of current goods rose by 5 to 7 points. Spot goods rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose and fell by 1 point, and spot goods rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 5 points. Indian cotton market closed.

<p>Also, the local American &amp; Oriental Cotton Company (美安棉行) received a New York telegram on April 21st stating that the cotton market lacks a clear trend. Near-term positions are being liquidated, causing nervousness. Spot cotton base prices remain stable, with few sellers. Demand is limited to Europe. Texas still needs rainfall. Preparations for new cotton crops elsewhere are progressing well.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Silk, Tea, Seawater Salt, and Spring Silkworm Rearing Significantly Reduced <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Rural economy declines... Silkworm egg prices are surprisingly cheap</p>
<p>Haiyan, Zhejiang is also a silkworm rearing area. Farmers in the surrounding villages regard sericulture as an important sideline. This year, the rural economy has declined significantly. There is nowhere to borrow funds for silkworm rearing. Only families with mulberry trees have reduced their rearing. The rearing volume has decreased significantly. Currently, after the second molt, silkworm egg prices are surprisingly cheap. In previous years, each sheet of eggs would sell for more than one yuan and several jiao. This year, it only sells for three or four jiao, and it's all on credit. The cocoon market this year is bound to be unusually depressed.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Zhejiang and Jiangxi Tea News <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Fuliang green tea picked early</p>
<p>The southeastern villages of Fuliang, such as Nan'an Tan, Zangjia Wan, and Shixiang, produce abundant tea. In addition to supplying foreign companies to produce black tea every year, the rest is picked green and sold to shops. This year, there are fewer tea shops in northern and western Fuliang than in the past. Farmers are deeply concerned about narrow sales channels and low prices. They plan to pick and sell to shops early because early-picked tea is tender and easily welcomed by buyers, and high prices can be obtained.</p>
<p>Suichun new tea will soon be available</p>
<p>Green tea in Sui'an and Chun'an, Zhejiang, sprouts earlier than in Anhui due to soil conditions in recent years. This year, tea shops in both places are extremely eager because the tea stocks in Shanghai have been sold out, and foreign companies have very high demand. Although the banks have tightened foreign exchange, most shops rely on money shops for loans. There is no concern that tea export companies will not be able to obtain funds. Tea shops in Gangkou, Weiping, and other places are very enthusiastic, raising and transporting cash to prepare for the market. If the weather warms up in the near future, new tea can be harvested. Tea merchants from Anhui and Jiangxi plan to relocate there to set up business because Sui'an has convenient transportation and abundant tea production.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Grain and Rice Market: Weak, Then Stable <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in southern Shanghai, there was continuous spring rain. Not many arrived from the west. There was a shortage of common bang special japonica rice. Scattered transactions of two to three thousand stones. The price is stable in the middle range. Special goods rose by a few jiao. Yinhua wine shops and food vendors continued to buy, and the price rose by half a yuan. Qingjiao white rice and Feilaifeng rice sold evenly, and the price remained the same. There were no significant fluctuations in the foreign Du-jian rice market.</p>
<p>In the northern market yesterday, the rice situation was that goods arrived from inland numbered in the teens and twenties. In the morning, the number of people entering the market was not very enthusiastic. Early rice and thin rice were the most abundant. The price rose by one jiao. Common Xizhou white japonica rice was available, causing the price to rise by five fen. The supply of foreign Du-jian rice was limited, and sales in this street were weak, with a softening trend.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Local Merchants Absorb Foreign Rice <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market stalled again. However, the passport for 30,000 bags from the Jiangbei firm has been issued and must be transported sooner or later. Local merchants are buying in advance, waiting for an opportunity. Retail sales to rural households were also slightly inquired, so the market did not decline due to the suspension of buying by 客辦. A total of 6,000 bags of Xiaojiao were opened on the market, priced at 10.005 yuan, 中 at 9.92 to 9.78 yuan. 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 were priced at 11.22 yuan. 100 tons of Xiaojiao for May delivery were priced at 5 taels. The transactions were conducted by local merchants and retail customers. The price was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Factories Maintain a Firm Stance on Spot Flour <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market generally trended sideways. Tianjin buyers were very quiet. Military ships were inactive, with only the fort having a small sales volume. Fujian Xingdai buyers absorbed two to three thousand bags throughout the day. Spot goods for April were flat and weak due to most people's eagerness to sell, still opening at 11.095 to 0.075 taels. The market sentiment for May was slightly better due to customer buying, opening from 0.0975 to 1.1025 taels, 0.025 taels better than the previous day. Observing the attitude of the factories, they remain firm. This price should be stable.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Turn Upward <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no significant rises or falls in the market conditions of sugar-producing areas. In the local association market, there was no hope for a postponement of the request for the new sugar tax. Therefore, market sentiment improved, and prices generally rose. Dutch Sugar No. 24 raw and white sugar was offered at 12.9 taels, and many buyers were still watching. Hong Kong goods traded at 12.7 taels, and transactions were still active. Later, several hundred loads of Dutch goods were traded at 12.85 taels. The supply was also lacking, and the market was still strong. Dutch red sugar No. 10 was relatively flat at 9.85 taels. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 16.2 taels, HX mark was 14.9 taels, HM mark was 13.75 taels, and Japanese mark was 12.1 taels, all taking advantage of the trend and being quite popular. There were more than 40 bags of domestic superior white powder opened on the market, priced at 15.5 taels, and the market situation was also very firm.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Textiles: Western Textiles in an Unfavorable Environment <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Arrivals are continuous</p>
<p>Sales to outside customers are sluggish</p>
<p>The Western textile market has become increasingly lifeless recently. The goods ordered in February and March of last year have been arriving in Shanghai successively. Northern ports are having brisk sales of Eastern goods at low prices, causing demand to turn sluggish. The Yangtze River firms are constrained by financial pressures and are also greatly weakened by the floods of last year, so their intention to buy is flat. Nanhua ports previously had sporadic transactions, but have recently stopped ordering due to the communist disturbances and the Xiamen firm has also stopped buying. In addition, because costs are high and the pound sterling is still difficult to rise, selling prices are falling step by step. The downward trend of feather yarn is even more severe. 斜地 is only selling at 3 qian on the market, silver bars at 4 qian up and down, and pepper ground at about 5 qian. However, the sales channels are limited. Only the Ningbo and Wenzhou firms have been buying slightly in recent days. The northern firm bought more than ten pieces of white striped linen gauze yesterday, with 中和 at 3 qian 2.5 fen, 好華 at 2 qian 8.5 fen, and 德記 at 2 qian 9 fen. The sales of 元羽 silk has been greatly reduced due to the under the table activities of Eastern goods. Yifeng Aiju sold for 11.5 taels, Gongping Sanyou for 13.5 taels, Tianfu Tianguan for 13.4 taels, and 華記's Four Mice 元帆布 were slightly bought in this street, priced at 5 qian 8 fen. Plain Western yarn became sluggish again after a period of activity. Double-line rainproof cloth, 怡和好華 and 華記 brands, were generally offered at 3 qian 7.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e148">North-South Goods: Lily Flower Drops Again and Again <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The near future is not promising</p>
<p>Lily flower returns have been poor due to weather conditions, and the goods are very susceptible to spoilage. Sales from all regions are unusually sluggish, so the market has fallen by as much as six or seven in total. It has been found that the stockpiles in Shanghai and Zhenjiang are still abundant, and supply exceeds demand. This is the main reason for the downward trend, and most people are eager to sell, so the market situation is still difficult to be optimistic about in the short term. Yesterday, the market's top Zhuang prices were 19 taels, with only scattered transactions. 中庄 reached 14 or 15 taels, and the secondary was not more than 10 taels to 7 or 8 taels, varying.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Hardware: Sales to Outside Customers Decrease, Difficult to Expect Progress <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Hardware transactions are increasingly quiet as long-term contracts expiring at the end of April. Transactions in various markets are unusually quiet. Although sales to outside customers of 嚋昔暢成 were once brisk, they are also quite scarce at present, due to the impact of tight credit. There is no hope for any development in this street's business. Quotations for various goods have declined as a result. The recent trend of green lead, tinplate, black iron sheet, and galvanized iron sheet all show signs of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. According to people in the industry, if one wants to see the development of the hardware future, it is feared that a large closing period is necessary.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Glimpses of the 19th Route Army <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao</p>
<p>The Japanese pirates harassed Shanghai. Both Chinese and foreigners were indignant. Our 19th Route Army resisted them, lasting for a month. Annihilated 20,000 enemy troops, raising our country's international status and striving for national survival. Especially admired by the imperial court and the common people. Huang Gu, the commander of the 155th Brigade of the army, was intelligent and capable, planning strategies and often achieving unexpected victories. Here are some anecdotes of the brigade to see a glimpse of our army's resistance against Japan this time.</p>
<p>Soldiers Persuade Each Other to Practice Target Shooting Since the September 18th Incident, people have been panicked, and the whole country has been boiling. The soldiers of the brigade were also very angry and excited. Brigade Commander Huang Gu, in his spare time, lectured his troops on the facts of the Eastern Provinces being lost and exposed the Japanese ambitions to seize Manchuria. The soldiers were furious when they heard this, with the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, hoping to fight to the death. During peacetime training, they became more diligent, especially in target shooting. In their target shooting, they first drew a human figure on the target with the words "Japanese" written on it. Then, they aimed at this target and shot. When a shot hit, they were all overjoyed, feeling relieved. They would either offer congratulatory remarks or shout anti-Japanese slogans.</p>
<p>Using Rice Bowls and Dishware to Repel the Enemy The enemy relied on the sophistication of their military equipment to attack us fiercely. However, most of their soldiers, raised in comfort and luxury, had no combat experience, so there were many who retreated in battle. On the evening of February 25th, more than 30 enemy soldiers came to spy on our positions. There were only three soldiers from the 155th Brigade stationed there. They were eating in the trenches when they saw the Japanese soldiers advancing. They didn't have time to raise their guns, so they took their rice bowls and dishes and threw them far away. Unexpectedly, the enemy soldiers were as timid as mice. They thought it was a hand grenade falling from the sky and quickly abandoned their armor and weapons and fled. We also let them go without chasing them, only clapping our hands and laughing.</p>
<p>Squad Leader Single-Handedly Seizes a New Gun During the Battle of Zhu Yuan Dun on February 25th, the enemy fired a series of shots. The sound was unusual, never heard before. Chen Youzhi, the squad leader of the 2nd Regiment of the brigade, had been in the army for a long time and was capable in battle. He figured it was the enemy's newest weapon and wanted to get it. At that time, the 5th Company of the regiment also wanted to seize this new killing weapon and charged bravely, sacrificing many. At night, the squad leader took advantage of the dim night and crept in from the side, sneaking into the enemy camp. Several enemy gunmen were asleep. So he killed them one by one and seized the gun to return. According to enemy prisoners, the gun was called a "helmet machine gun," the latest Japanese invention, light and sharp, and could not be compared with other guns. This was the first time it was used on the battlefield.</p>
<p>[P The Modern World</p>
<p>— Translated by Yi</p>
<p>What exactly is a modern world?</p>
<p>It is a playground. In every field, there shines a light of hypocrisy. With irony and ridicule, they perform dramas of the remnants of justice and morality that people consider to be outdated.</p>
<p>It is a conservatory of music. The sounds of cheering and booing drown out all the music. One cannot tell whether the musician's tune is correct or whether the rhythm of the instruments is in sync.</p>
<p>It is a large casino. Dice and playing cards fly everywhere. Throughout the hall, we can vaguely and intermittently hear the triumphant laughter and disappointed sighs of gamblers.</p>
<p>It is a grand banquet. On the ceiling, many sharp swords hang by thin threads. Each sword has a guest sitting beneath it, and an invisible hand writes terrifying words on the wall. But all the guests calmly and carelessly drink wildly.</p>
<p>It is a store. Even the dust inside is worth a golden price. They all trade with each other using deception and fraud.</p>
<p>It is a maze. No matter how nimble you are and how you follow the guiding thread from the past, you can walk a hundred circles in the crossroads and never find the way out you imagined.</p>
<p>It is a sea full of reefs. Although it is a calm and tranquil ocean, shipwrecks and sunken ships lie everywhere. Because the light illuminating the lighthouses in the sea completely deceives the eyes of sailors. The anchors cannot be cast on the soft mud on the seabed. The ship circles on the turbulent water, unable to move forward or backward. The boatman peers at the afterglow of the setting sun, panicking and bewildered. Looking ahead, he does not know where to find his final destination in the vast ocean.</p>

<p>To Brother Shi Shipan: I have not seen you in a long time, and I am thinking of you. I have a friend who heard that you created a Chinese sound film machine and wants to invest in cooperation.

<p>Those with guns say, "I can't beat him"; those without guns say, "I can't hit him." So they have to be slaughtered!</p>
<p>The Chinese are most brave in fighting the Chinese, no wonder the Japanese want to drive the Chinese to fight the Chinese.</p>
<p>A part of the people are shouting "National crisis is imminent," and many people are indifferent because the "national crisis" is on the heads of a part of the people, behind the brains of a part of the people.</p>
<p>When the September 18th Incident occurred, other ordinary people said, "The people of the Northeast are suffering." When the January 28th Incident occurred, other ordinary people said, "The people of Shanghai are suffering." These ordinary people do not seem to have thought that the people of the Northeast and Shanghai are their own compatriots, let alone that their own positions are the same as those of the Northeast and Shanghai.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Betrayal and Severance of Friendship Unluckily Encountering a Generous Guest, Anger is Bound, and Deliberating Strategy is Most Difficult to Endure, the Beauty's Favor</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, that night at midnight, the camp was in an uproar. A battalion of soldiers arrived to suppress bandits, calling to open the camp gate to come in and search for the bandit leader, Niu Heifeng. An Dacheng inquired with the battalion commander leading the team, and it turned out that An Dakui had called them. Because the military headquarters was offering a heavy reward for the capture of Niu Heifeng. An Dakui had long wanted to be promoted to a substantive military officer but had no opportunity. So he did not hesitate to sell out his friend for glory and reported to the garrison headquarters. He had also brought another battalion of troops to provide backup. He initially thought that if Niu Heifeng entered his Anjia Camp, he would have to stay at least one night. Wouldn't that be like a turtle in a jar, easily captured and sent to claim the credit? He did not expect Niu Heifeng to fall for this trick, which made him miss. An Dacheng heard this and was greatly dissatisfied, only scolding him for acting absurdly and not leaving any room for maneuver. He had not consulted at all beforehand before randomly asking for troops. Fortunately, Niu Heifeng had already left, and there had been no conflict between the two sides. Even if he caught Niu Heifeng with a cold stab and achieved his goal of promotion and wealth, Niu Heifeng would not have spared me before being caught. The good Anjia Camp would have been ruined by him, first suffering the calamity of the fish in the pond. When An Dakui failed to capture Niu Heifeng and heard that An Dacheng was blaming him, he did not return to the camp. He quietly withdrew his troops and returned. Even more unexpectedly, Niu Heifeng's ears and eyes were very sharp. The secret agents he had sent out had already swiftly reported these things to Niu Heifeng. Upon hearing this, Niu Heifeng became furious, thinking that the Anjia brothers were not enough friends. Since they were not kind, he would not be righteous. He immediately gathered six or seven hundred bandits. Taking advantage of the fact that the government troops had not gone far, he turned around and returned to Anjia Camp. An Dacheng knew things were bad, but he thought there was still room for explanation. He still ordered the group to open the camp gate and let them in. He did not expect that Niu Heifeng was now harboring resentment and no longer recognized anyone. Outside the camp gate, he shouted loudly and first captured An Dacheng. Then, a swarm of people rushed into the camp, killing people indiscriminately and burning houses upon seeing them. Pitifully, An Dacheng was implicated by his brother and died under the bandits' random gunfire before he could say a word. When the house caught fire, An Da's wife and family members were also burned to death. Only a loyal long-term worker rescued An Yuyuan in the emergency, hiding him in the cabbage field behind the house to avoid the disaster.</p>

<p>Talking and Saying</p>
<h3 id="e154">On the Rumor of Pu Yi's Assassination in Changchun <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper a report from Shenyang that "Pu Yi was assassinated in Changchun, but not fatally wounded. The reason was his refusal to sign the new Japan-Manchukuo treaty, leading to a warning from the Japanese faction." Whether this news is accurate is still unknown. Assuming this is indeed the case, some say it is Pu Yi's good fortune, but I say it is Pu Yi's great misfortune.</p>
<p>Some say that Pu Yi is still clear-headed, enjoys reading, and has quite modern ideas. This time, a new farce was staged in the Northeast, partly due to his being kidnapped by the Japanese and partly due to the restoration dreams of a bunch of sycophants. I don't entirely believe this, but perhaps there is some truth to it. If it were true that Pu Yi was assassinated in Changchun, it would be excellent proof that Pu Yi's conscience was not entirely lost. We could all forgive him and mourn him.</p>
<p>If he was not assassinated, then he is living a life of torment. In name, he is the head of state, but in reality, he has not a shred of sovereignty, being entirely a puppet. What difference is there between such a head of state and being imprisoned? Looking back at our entire history, has any monarch who lost his country survived unscathed? Yet, when the Qing Dynasty abdicated, not only was he not harmed, but he was also given royal treatment and expenses of several million yuan per year. Now, because the country's finances are exhausted, this payment has been canceled. But the Republic's treatment of Pu Yi can truly be called benevolent and righteous. Pu Yi should think about it and be moved to tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>Therefore, I deeply fear that this news is inaccurate, and if it is accurate, I even more deeply regret that he did not die.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Poems on Luoyang by Xu Ying</p>
<p>The aura of kingship in the southeast has long faded away,</p>
<p>Hairpins of gold lie scattered, no longer in rows.</p>
<p>The beacon fires of Lord Chunshen rise to the heavens,</p>
<p>A blue canopy hurriedly enters Luoyang.</p>
<p>The palaces of Luoyang, a desolate, cold mist,</p>
<p>In the desolate world, years pass.</p>
<p>Suddenly, news arrives of a court assembly in spring,</p>
<p>The east wind brings a night of blooming flowers.</p>
<p>Looking south to Chunshen, already three thousand li,</p>
<p>No alarms sound, sleeping peacefully in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Still calling Chang'an a secondary capital,</p>
<p>Planning to flee further west to avoid the barbarians.</p>
<p>The spring waters of Jin Bridge surpass the waves of Wu,</p>
<p>More beautiful than the sights of Jinling.</p>
<p>Fleeing west, only seeking to evade the invaders,</p>
<p>Moreover, hearing of a comfortable place to settle.</p>
<p>What is the use of a million heroic troops,</p>
<p>Hanging their hands, heading southeast to surrender?</p>
<p>From now on, the principle is non-resistance,</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Qin Hui is the one who knew best.</p>
<p>Returning to reside once more on the western coast,</p>
<p>Scheming and vying for power, desires fulfilled.</p>
<p>Yet laughing that an official post can cause illness,</p>
<p>The governor alone can claim a thousand autumns.</p>
<p>Slandering Niu and ousting Li, wasting effort on management,</p>
<p>High salaries and official positions, matters finally settled.</p>
<p>The ambition to restore the Central Plains is ultimately abandoned,</p>
<p>Only now realizing that Yin Hao was just empty words.</p>
<p>The petty man changes his face but not his heart,</p>
<p>The flawed lineage is passed down, is it just today?</p>
<p>Neither fighting, surrendering, nor fleeing,</p>
<p>You gentlemen are still ashamed of Ye Mingchen.</p>
<p>The gathered heroes fly to the Western Palace,</p>
<p>Striving to devise plans to defend the nation from calamity.</p>
<p>Alas, the courtyard is full of empty, good ideas,</p>
<p>Spring comes, always delaying the beauty's rainbow.</p>
<p>Entrusting the rise and fall of the former kingdom to mournful poems,</p>
<p>Banners and flags seen in the distance, barbarian clouds deep.</p>
<p>In what year will the halberd be drawn to pass through three households,</p>
<p>The old men of Chu meet, tears filling their sleeves.</p>

<p>Glass Ceramics by Xiao Tao</p>
<p>Glass is extremely useful to mankind. On a small scale, it can help people see microorganisms that are invisible to the naked eye; on a large scale, it can help people study stars hundreds of millions of light-years away. Each light-year equals six trillion miles, because light travels six trillion miles in a year. Telescopes made of glass can allow people to see stars six trillion trillion miles away. To put it more simply, glass windows allow light to enter the room but prevent flies from coming in to make trouble. What a wonderful invention! The uses of everyday lampshades, bottles, and cups are also obvious. Since the functions of glass are so great, how can we not know its history and manufacturing?</p>
<p>Several thousand years ago, the Egyptians were already making glass, but the glass they made was not very good, even less transparent than today's dark glass bottles. By the fifteenth century, the Phoenicians in Europe could make transparent glass, but it was only used to make decorations for a few nobles, and its value was simply more precious than gold.</p>
<p>Its manufacturing method commonly involves mixing limestone, sodium carbonate, and silica sand (also known as silicon dioxide) and then burning it in a kiln. When heated to about 200 degrees Celsius, the mixture melts into a transparent liquid, which becomes a solid when cooled, i.e., glass. While in liquid form, a long blowpipe about five feet long is dipped into it, and then it is blown into a circle with the mouth. The blowpipe is cut off from the blown glass item, and then it is placed in a greenhouse to let it cool gradually so that it is very strong. If it cools down suddenly, it is easily broken. If we want to blow bottles of various shapes, then a mold is essential. Dip a little glass liquid with the blowpipe into the mold, and blow it to produce something that is the same as the mold. Ordinary glass for making chemical equipment contains potassium salt, and the resulting glass is hard, called hard glass. Glass made with sodium salt is softer, called soft glass, and can be used to make glass for doors and windows. Glass made with lead oxide instead of limestone is soft and has a high refractive index, making it suitable for optical instruments such as lenses. Glass for glass windows is made by blowing the glass liquid into a long cylindrical shape, cutting it in the middle, and then flattening it. Glass items that come out of the mold are very rough, but they can be modified at will. The glass industry in China has gradually developed. Jinan in Shandong and Zhabei in Shanghai both have small-scale glass factories. Visiting them nearby can broaden one's knowledge a lot.</p>

<p>The Tragic Encounter of the No. 8 Oriole</p>
<p>A small group of refugees was walking slowly on a certain road in western Shanghai. In the crowd, they were regarded as a kind of subhuman animal.</p>
<p>They walked across Zhongshan Bridge, turned back northwest, gradually moving away from the noisy Shanghai. When they passed the first village, they smelled the breath of the new spring and saw the green plants. This made them feel as if they had escaped from the high-pressure air, so they quickened their pace.</p>
<p>Indeed, they couldn't even afford a wheelbarrow for a dollar. They were prepared to walk the more than fifty li of the long journey on their two legs, so they had to take advantage of rest to recover from their fatigue.</p>
<p>After passing the railway, they began to encounter groups of farmers fleeing towards Shanghai. Occasionally, one or two fellow villagers were mixed in, and they would stop and chat for a few words. Those who were closer would advise them to turn back, describing one or two fresh events in a terrifying tone. In the end, they would add a sentence... ["Going back to hell, you?"]</p>
<p>Among them was a thrifty middle-aged farmer, clutching his tears, murmuring in reply to them: ["What can we do? The refugee camps are just as much hell. We might as well go back to our own village to die."]</p>
<p>This was a remote, isolated village. Apart from a few crows cawing, not even a live dog could be found in the village. There were two or three Japanese slogans on the broken walls, stripped of their corners, blowing in the wind. Although the houses still existed, there was no longer a single complete thing in the houses. Everything was messy straw, torn clothes, and destroyed doors, windows, and furniture.</p>
<p>Now, they were trapped in the deep abyss of despair. Faintly, voices came closer from the distance. They heard them very clearly. This was a very unusual sound. Everyone stood up in shock and secretly ran to the outside of the threshing ground. Suddenly, on the eastern corner of the village's harvest field, three soldiers appeared who were not from our country. This shocking discovery caused them to lose consciousness.</p>
<p>A sinister laugh mixed with a string of "Ji Ge Ji Ge" words. At first, they patted the women's shoulders and tapped the women's small feet with the butts of their guns. Then, they gestured, wanting them to take off their clothes together. They clasped their trembling hands in a bow, but this was ineffective.</p>
<p>Finally, they tied up the two men who were almost dead from anger and terror and threw them one by one onto the harvest field. Then, they dragged a woman each into the house.</p>
<p>When the sun emitted its last ray of light in the western sky, the three bestial men left. Only then did they struggle out.</p>
<p>In this way, they decided on their plan to leave again tomorrow. All the feelings of shame, anger, and terror turned into tears.</p>

<p>The Home of Officials by Wu</p>
<p>The only reason I ran to Mrs. Li's house today was to pay a visit as a friend. As soon as I walked in, I heard the lively sound of mahjong tiles. I thought, "I've come at a good time, or else I'd have to fill in for one of them when they were 'one short.' But today, everyone is here, so they probably won't need me to give them money for cigarettes." Sure enough, when the insignificant me appeared before her, she only said seemingly apologetically:</p>
<p>"Sorry, we're playing mahjong again... Lotus... bring tea and cigarettes for the guest!"</p>
<p>Then a lovely young maid served tea and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Before long, the mahjong game ended. Mrs. Li's mahjong luck was really good. In front of her was a neat pile of copper coins and several silver dollars. As soon as she got up, she called me to her "opium den." A maid had already prepared the opium pipe and was waiting for her. So she lazily lay down. After yawning, she revealed her dark teeth with a smile and said:</p>
<p>"Today, I really invited the God of Wealth." I won the "flower game," and I also won quite a few copper coins playing mahjong."</p>
<p>"Good luck, good luck!... What did the 'flower game' pay out today?" I asked to join in the fun, because this would definitely make her very happy.</p>
<p>"I dreamt last night that there was no more war, and today, it actually paid out 'Peace.' Isn't that really strange?" "Ah! Mrs. Li's dreams are really accurate. When will I get to benefit from your good fortune and bet a few copper coins with you?" I guessed correctly, this pleased her very much, but she didn't have time to laugh, because she was already sucking on that thick opium pipe.</p>
<p>From her conversation, I learned that Mr. Li had gone from Guangdong to Luoyang to participate in the so-called important, crucial national crisis conference. She could have taken this opportunity to see the peonies in "Temporary Capital" (because all the hospitality expenses are paid by the government), but because Mr. Li took a woman who had gone from being a private secretary to becoming a concubine with him, this made her feel embarrassed, so she was happy to relax at home. However, Mr. Li had sent quite a bit of money since going to Luoyang and was confident of securing a very profitable position, which made Mrs. Li smile from ear to ear.</p>
<p>"I heard that there's going to be another war in Shanghai. What should we do?" she suddenly asked worriedly, so I also echoed her and said:</p>
<p>"That's not going to happen. That's right, Mrs. Li! Tomorrow, 'Nine Officials' or 'Ten Thousand Gold' are very good characters to bet on."</p>

<p>A Sketch of Xiao Te's Funeral by Lao Tang</p>
<p>A sky covered with dark clouds enveloped everything. The wide Jing'an Temple Road was crowded with spectators watching the "Grand Funeral Procession." The "Sando Tou" and "Ah San" faces were covered with beads of "calling customs" sweat. The movie cameras and tens of thousands of eyes were waiting eagerly, like waiting for rain in a great drought, for the arrival of the coffin of the righteous warrior Xiao Te who sacrificed for humanity and justice!</p>
<p>From one o'clock to two o'clock and even three o'clock and four o'clock, after several rounds of light rain, hope finally became a reality.</p>
<p>Boy Scouts with tilted hats passed through our line of sight with the ding-a-ling of bicycle bells, followed by cars carrying wreaths, cars carrying coffins, cars carrying Girl Scouts, cars carrying foreign men and women, cars following cars, cars still following cars.</p>
<p>After a group of green mourners disappeared from the audience's eyes, those who had raised their heads retracted them, and the people standing in the middle of the road retreated to the sidewalk. Finally, the character dismantler at the entrance of Jing'an Temple, after touching his mustache several times, stepped down from his special box-like stool.</p>
<p>On the way home, I heard two kinds of voices:</p>
<p>"Nothing to see!"</p>
<p>"If I had known it would be like this, who would have been happy to wait three or four hours!"</p>
<p>After returning home and looking at the newspaper on my desk, I realized that I hadn't looked "carefully" just now. It turned out that the newspaper clearly stated that the procession would "turn around at Xiaoshadu Road." I asked the people who watched at the entrance of Hardoon Garden, and they said they saw three bands.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Current State of the British Automobile Industry <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Sluggish Sales of American Cars</p>
<p>Although the automobile manufacturing industry in Britain is considered developed in Europe, there is a vast disparity in output compared to the United States. Therefore, British-made cars are insufficient to meet the needs of the country and its colonies. Consequently, American-made cars have held a significant position in the British market. In recent times, the European economic situation has deteriorated drastically, with all industries declining and people facing great hardship. To protect their interests, various countries have used different methods to promote the development of domestic industries and encourage citizens to buy domestically produced goods. Hence, Britain has adopted the slogan "Buy British Goods," which has had some impact.</p>
<p>Last year, the number of cars shipped from the United States to Britain for sale was only 3,330 units, a significant decline compared to previous years. Two years ago, in 1930, 10,694 American-made cars were sold in Britain, and in 1929, the number was even higher, totaling 22,729 units. Comparing these three figures, the rise and fall can be clearly seen. Considering just December of last year, the total number of cars and chassis manufactured in the United States and shipped to Britain for sale was only 80 units. In the same period in 1929, there were as many as 1,019 units.</p>
<p>The reasons why American cars have not sold well in Britain have been mentioned above. Additionally, there is another significant reason: the implementation of horsepower taxation and the popularity of small cars. Horsepower taxation is based on the engine's horsepower to determine the tax to be paid. The import tax on foreign-made cars is also very high, deterring potential buyers. As for large British-made cars, their sales have become even more sluggish, as those with 20, 30, or 40 horsepower are subject to extremely high taxes, leading to a lack of demand. Consequently, the resale of old cars does not fetch a good price. Recently, a Dutch merchant in Britain purchased over 400 old British cars and shipped them to the Netherlands, as there is no horsepower taxation there.</p>
<p>To avoid horsepower taxation, British car manufacturers have been striving to produce and sell small cars, generally with 9, 10, or 15 horsepower. At the last British Motor Show, 12 car dealerships showcased small cars. These cars are often referred to as "baby cars," with most having horsepower exceeding 10. The advantage of small cars is not only avoiding high taxes but also their significant economic benefits, such as fuel savings and reduced costs. Therefore, they have become popular, with many people abandoning large cars for smaller ones. In the past two months, the exact number of British car sales within the country is unknown, but it is estimated to be around 138,000 units, while American car sales are only about 4,200 units. This is a far cry from the 155,000 units in 1930. On the export side, due to the devaluation of the pound, there has been improvement, with 18,992 units last year compared to 23,210 units in 1930. In the last two months of last year, November and December, the devaluation of the pound was particularly advantageous, with 4,560 cars exported, compared to only 4,119 units in the same period in 1930.</p>
<p>British car dealerships and manufacturers are fiercely competing with American car sales. Many American car factories have established plants in Britain to manufacture cars. According to a survey last year, the commercial vehicles sold by these American factories are entirely manufactured in Britain and exported to various British territories, resulting in substantial profits. Another car factory, with half of its products manufactured in Britain, experienced a 10% decline in sales due to commercial recession. The sales of British-made commercial vehicles last year are estimated to be around 50,000 units.</p>
<p>In 1931, the total number of British cars sold in New Zealand was 2,414 units, worth £272,285, while the sales of American cars were only 475 units, worth $59,975. American car sales in Africa were also significantly lower, and the situation in Ceylon was similar. British car sales in these two regions were quite brisk. In Australia, due to various factors, car imports have generally declined, but the sales of British-made cars in Australia increased to 50.7% in the first six months of 1931, compared to only 17% in the same period in 1930. Therefore, the outlook for the British car export industry is optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Reflections on the Automotive Industry in Soviet Russia <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The automotive industry is a significant asset in war, which readers have probably long realized. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense, with newspaper reports suggesting that Russia and Japan are busily preparing for war, creating a sense of imminent conflict. Therefore, readers are keen to know the current state of the automotive industry in Soviet Russia. Below is a record of Soviet Russia's recent plans and progress in the automotive industry to inform this publication.</p>
<p>Although industry in Soviet Russia has been developing rapidly, there has been a lack of automobile manufacturing plants. The cars used in Russia were originally imported from the United States. However, recently, the Soviet authorities, recognizing the importance of the automotive industry to the national economy, people's livelihood, and military preparedness, have decided to implement domestic automobile manufacturing. Most of the automobile factories that were under construction have now been completed. Not long ago, the first Soviet-made car was successfully produced, and newspapers and magazines widely reported this event as a celebration. Soon, the second Soviet-made car will be available on the market. Currently, cars are being manufactured only in temporary factories, producing about five cars per day. However, all the parts are imported from the United States. Therefore, the cars currently produced in Soviet Russia are better described as "assembled" rather than "made." The automobile factories planned by the Soviet Union are no different from the largest, most modern automobile factories in Detroit, USA. In fact, we have seen many such factories. From another perspective, once Soviet Russia can manufacture cars independently, producing a thousand cars per day will not be difficult. It is only a matter of time. From the day the first car is produced to the completion of the automotive industry, there will be different stages of development, proceeding according to plan. The current factories aim to produce 400 cars per day, which is the highest goal. It is hoped that certain parts of the cars can be manufactured domestically. The progress is planned in five-year increments. In the first two years, all parts will be imported from the United States, with only assembly being done locally. By the end of the third year, at least half of the parts should be manufactured domestically. By the end of the fourth year, about 75% should be domestic. By the end of the fifth year, everything needed for the cars should be manufactured domestically, without relying on supplies from the United States. The construction of the factory buildings is entirely based on the form of the Cleveland Austin Car Factory. After the completion of this factory, all future work will not depend on others. Even the water supply will be provided by artesian wells. In this new factory, various machines have not yet been purchased, so the arrangement methods have not yet been determined. Once the machines are purchased, the arrangement will be done according to the form. Before the machines were ordered, the United States, Germany, and Britain were all competing for the business in Soviet Russia. Therefore, under these circumstances, it is not yet determined which country's products Soviet Russia will purchase in the future. Starting from November 1st last year, work has been intensified to expedite the completion of the factory buildings. It is expected that after completion, the interior will house at least 6,000 motors, and the scale will be impressive. The number of workers in this massive factory will undoubtedly be large. Therefore, the factory has decided to build worker housing. In this housing area, there will be hotels, parks, municipal halls, hospitals, schools, and all other facilities related to worker life. The plan is to build 300 four-story brick buildings, each housing 200 families. Upon completion, it will be like a new town.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Safety of the New Studebaker Car <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The new Studebaker car has numerous features, but its most prominent feature is its safety construction. Among vehicles in the medium price range, there is no car like the new Studebaker that has so many safety features providing ample protection. Here are the most noteworthy safety features: The new Studebaker car, regardless of its style, comes standard with safety glass for its windshield and windows, without extra charge. This glass is clear as a mirror and unaffected by moisture. It is made by combining two layers with a thick, transparent material. Even in the event of a violent impact, it will only crack and not shatter, as the fragments stick to the laminated layer. This is further enhanced by the all-steel welded body construction, which provides even greater safety. The excellent chassis construction is also a major reason for Studebaker's absolute safety. The chassis has a double drop frame, and the body is mounted exquisitely and appropriately. The front and rear wheels are also particularly widened, so the center of gravity is lowered, and the entire car operates smoothly and without vibration. Other features, such as improved free-wheeling, automatic driving management, automatic choke, safety steel-core steering wheel, and new reflector taillights, all provide passengers and drivers with safety and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Statistics</p>
<h3 id="e168">Last Year's U.S. Car Sales Statistics Praised <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>According to recent official statistics obtained locally, the total number of new passenger cars registered in the United States in 1931 was 1,908,016 units. Car sales in that year fell by 700,000 units compared to 1930. The number of cars sold in the United States in the previous year was 2,626,068 units. Currently, leaders in the automotive manufacturing industry have different views on the future of the industry this year. Some giants and leaders predict that the number of used car sales this year will greatly benefit car sales in the United States, reaching 3,000,000 units. This is the optimistic estimate. The second group, the conservatives, predict that the minimum car sales will be around 2,000,000 units. Others say that car sales this year will be approximately between 2,500,000 and 3,000,000 units.</p>
<p>Of the total number of cars sold in the United States, Chevrolet, manufactured by General Motors, was the champion, with a total of 583,387 units. Ford came in second, with a ratio of 9 to 10. According to last year's statistics, Chevrolet's sales accounted for one-third of all car sales in the United States. The sales of the 20 most famous cars in the United States in 1931 are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Chevrolet 583,387 units 2. Ford 528,539 units 3. Plymouth 94,278 units 4. Buick 90,871 units 5. Pontiac 73,154 units 6. Dodge 53,068 units</p>
<p>7. Chrysler 52,664 units 8. Whippet 46,679 units 9. Studebaker 46,653 units 10. Essex 42,543 units 11. Nash 39,366 units 12. Willys 38,572 units 13. Auburn 29,535 units 14. DeSoto 28,429 units 15. Graham 19,207 units 16. Hudson 19,188 units 17. Whippet 17,425 units 18. Packard 16,252 units 19. Oakland 12,985 units 20. Cadillac 11,135 units According to the above statistics, it should be known that the top three cars are all in the low-price class of American cars. Among them, Chevrolet ranked first with the largest sales. Ford's passenger car sales were also not small, ranking second. Plymouth was the first in this class of cars to use free-wheeling construction and have "floating" power. Last year's sales unexpectedly increased greatly, ranking third in total car sales in the United States.</p>
<p>In 1930, Buick and Pontiac ranked third and fourth in American car sales. In 1931, Plymouth jumped to third place above Buick and Pontiac, which is a rare phenomenon in recent times. Plymouth is a product of Chrysler Motors and sells widely in Eastern countries. Buick still maintains its original position among its peers with similar prices. Although its sales seem weaker than in 1930, its reputation is still good. In 1931, Plymouth made rapid progress, pushing Pontiac from fourth to fifth place. In reality, its sales increased by more than 5,000 units compared to 1930. Ford's products were completely new, with the introduction of new four-cylinder and eight-cylinder cars, which was quite sensational. However, its sales in 1931 fell the most. Sales in 1931 totaled 528,539 units, a decrease of about 500,000 units compared to 1930. Ford's sales in 1930 were 1,055,105 units. The list of sales of the 20 most famous cars in the United States in 1930 is as follows:</p>

<p>Henry Royce's Biography</p>
<p>Earl Henry Royce is a famous automobile manufacturer. The outstanding performance of the British seaplane in winning the Schneider Trophy and achieving a record of 400 miles per hour was due to the internal machinery manufactured by Royce. The Standard "Swallow" car, which is not scheduled to arrive in Shanghai,</p>
<p>The British Standard cars managed by the China Motor Company have arrived, including the Standard "Little Nine," Standard "Big Nine," Standard "Nineteen," and Standard "Twenty." These four types of cars are well received by all sectors of society. It is recently heard that there is also a Standard "Swallow" car that is not scheduled to arrive in Shanghai. This car is a specially low-built two-seater roadster, with a large luggage compartment behind the car body, making it a modern and practical sports car.</p>
<p>Therefore, he has made great contributions to it. Like other American and British automotive kings, their families were mostly poor before their success. For example, Ford in the United States was a craftsman in his early years, John Willys was a repair clerk, and Earl Austin of Britain was a technician's apprentice in his youth. Earl Morris started as a machinist. However, Earl Henry's environment was even worse. Reading his biography, it is known that it was even more difficult for him to reach his current position. He was orphaned at the age of nine. The following year, he became a newsboy in London, earning his own living. From the age of fourteen to seventeen, he entered a railway factory as an apprentice. After graduating, he entered the Lee Manufacturing Bureau. Soon after, he transferred to a tool factory, earning two dollars and seventy-five cents a week for 54 hours of hard work.</p>
<p>He only received three years of education, but he had a wealth of knowledge in electrical engineering. Therefore, he was employed by the London Electric Light Company. Unfortunately, the company went bankrupt when he was only nineteen years old.</p>
<p>He was not deterred by the setback, and he used his meager savings to open a small Royce company, specializing in the manufacture of arc light bulbs. However, this business did not generate much income, so in 1884, he began manufacturing power generators. Suddenly, cotton mills, ships, and local factories began to use generators, and the demand increased greatly. However, in 1900, prices fell slightly due to the colonial war.</p>
<p>At that time, Royce bought a car to save time and money, but he was greatly disappointed because the car was unreliable and noisy. Therefore, Henry brought the car into the factory and dismantled it completely to see how it was made.</p>
<p>Soon, he planned to build his own car, improving the engine and removing noise. In 1903, he succeeded. However, the car was small, with only ten horsepower. However, it was valued by Rolls. They agreed to manufacture cars in Manchester. As the supply could not meet the demand, they expanded to Derby and opened a Rolls-Royce company.</p>
<p>Initially, they only raised 50,000 yuan in capital, and the architect used 5,000 yuan. Royce also personally designed the first building, which still exists today. The factory was completed and opened in 1906.</p>
<p>Today, Earl Henry is still a director, major shareholder, and chief technician of the company. He completes the Rolls-Royce engine, he designs and manufactures the machines, which enabled the British Air Force to defeat Germany in the last World War, and he manufactures the interior of the aircraft, which enabled John Alcock and Arthur Brown to successfully fly across the Atlantic for the first time. He also plans and manufactures the engines to be particularly effective, which helped the British Royal Air Force win three consecutive Schneider Trophy victories.</p>
<p>In 1930, Henry Royce was ennobled as a baronet. At the celebration banquet last year, he was very humble, saying, "In the early years of struggle, the general technicians and foremen were more meritorious than I."</p>
<p>His actions can be represented by the motto on the door of the Derby factory: "Why are we poor? Because we are wasteful, especially in wasting time." (Remuneration for Relief)</p>
