<h3 id="c1">日本承認僞國與世界之危機 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日本承認僞國之怪劇。已於鑼鼓喧天之後。演入正塲矣。今日以前。中國曾盡力阻止此怪劇之開演。世界主持公義者。亦曾一致表示不歡迎此怪劇之見於世界舞台。而彼軍閥專政之日本竟蔑視中國全體堅决之表示。違逆世界公共之輿論。不稍有所斂戢。以有今日之行動。則在今日。我中國除誓死否認。以實力貫澈所表示之態度外。已不必再有所言。而列强如眞欲避免世界紊亂之因此實現其對日發揮國際制裁之力量。亦已不容稍緩</p>
<p>中國對於日本之製造僞國。及其無理取閙之承認問題。歷有所聲明。八月二十九日外長羅文幹駁日外相内田演說之言論中。更嚴重聲明。中國絶對不因武力之壓迫。而放棄尺土寸地或主權之一部。同時對於武力之侵襲。决盡其力量。予以抵抗此中國外交當局依據國民公意所表示之正當態度。今日本承認僞國巳成事實。中國國民巳决意一面督促政府。以實力收回東北之土地主權。一面各盡其力。以圖所以自救。成敗利鈍。雖難逆料。而觀於東北義勇軍活動之現勢。則我中國人民。不肯輕易放棄其無端被人侵佔之土地。而决意盡力與敵人周旋。巳可槪見。此吾人於怪劇開演之今日。所不能不向世界鄭重表示者。</p>
<p>圖際間之於東北事件發生後。早應予日本以應有之制裁。而所以至今未見制裁力之發揮者。無非敷衍目前。暫維亞洲之和平耳。然吾人認爲過去亞洲大陸之能得小康者。其最大之理由。一爲列强内部經濟之不安定。二爲列强在中國勢力均衡之牽制。今若於此世界經濟極度恐慌之秋。列强在華。再稍有不合公理之舉動。則中國人民激于義憤。甘願犧牲。其結果恐非特無以助各國解除生産過剩之煩惱。或且反以促進世界經濟之崩潰。亦未可知。再日本旣獨佔我東北。獲取豐富之戰爭原料。則列强愈有直接衝突之可能。權利競爭之機一動。即難維持苟安之局勢近人每恐東北問題。成爲引起世界二次大混亂之導線。即緣於此。今若日本實行承認僞國。寗能保其不成爲二次大混亂之導線。世界與遠東和平。又將何從維持。此在怪劇開演之今日。更强所亟應認明者也。</p>
<p>孫中山先生易簀之際。默誦「和平·奮鬥·救中國」且遺囑中。又以「……聯合世界上以平等待我之民族。共同奮鬥。」昭示全國。倘使列强間不能維持公理。迫我於無可容身之絶境。則我國人民窮無所之。惟有起而聯俄或聯合世界弱小民族。以趨於共同奮鬥之一途。至發生一列强所不及料之變動。亦所難料。</p>
<p>故就上述各方面觀察日本承認僞國以後。若我國不即以武力討伐。或列强不予以公理之判斷。則世界和平前途。誠堪憂慮。而列强自身。亦未便樂觀。吾人今日。固惟有盡力於自救自助。然爲世界友邦計「救人即所以自救。助人即所以自助。」勿明于近利而惑于遠害。庶使世界和平。或可收亡羊補牢之功。不然。一旦巨變突起。所受直接之影響者。固不僅我中國已也。</p>

<p>只有二分半的性命</p>
<p>「騎馬行船三分命」、但是從膚施到甘谷峪的乘坐夾　之險只有二分半的性命、這是北組副主任劉澄厚於八月三十日下午五時、到了甘谷略住所時很有感觸的話、的確那天（三十日）的路、並不十分難走、而各人遭遇的情形、却是危險極了、猶憶那天淸晨七時半的時候、我們的驢馬和夾窩、搖搖擺擺、浩浩蕩蕩的走出膚施城門、不到三四分鐘、我所乘坐的夾窩、忽然後面的一匹驢子、好像是見了上海辣斐花園的音樂、狠高興地跳舞起來、我覺得事情有些不妙、立卽出窩步行、而面前情深如海的鑛業家黄伯逵君堅欲和我交換乘坐、我却之不恭、只好聽之、不料中途夾窩的前後二驢、都同時舞蹈起來、夾窩頓時翻下、旁觀者多爲黄君揑一把汗、但黄幸未受傷下午一時、我們石磘店子打煎（即休息）旣畢、陜省府參議馮煥章君所坐的夾窩、當在渡河時候、夾窩到了中流、前驢和從驢不合作、前驢便脫離夾窩而獨立、馮氏幾乎翻入水中、十分危險、除此以外、朱節瑞君從馬上跌下來、一足受傷很重、他雖然請了團醫胡廷玉君醫治、但是他步行的時候、依然還有些鐡拐仙的神態、</p>
<p>甘谷峪不過從膚施到延長中間、我們的一個過夜的地方、因爲膚施和延長相距有一百六十里之遥、我們每天所走的路程、不過八九十里、因此我們便在甘谷峪的一個小學校中住宿一夜、翌晨（三十一日）一淸早、可是我們起來趕路的時候、大家都起了戒心、因此拖拉夾窩的驢子們、到了懸崖屹立的當兒、也發起了舞興來、那末我們的生命、就發生問題、一時棄夾窩而步行的人、增加不少、果然中途農學家李永興君的夾窩、突然取了一百八十度的姿勢翻了下來、到篋翻箱、淋漓盡致、幸虧李君早已加入步行、脫了此厄、不然、至少要擦去了些額上的皮、飽受一塲虚驚哩、</p>
<p>在正午十二時黑家堡打煎之後、我們大部分都是以爲覆窩可鑒、實行步行、可是羣山陡然兀立、道旁石片滿地、卽步行也是不易、我們拚命的向前進、一時左右、便跑到了西河子溝、因河水在涸、水流僅狹如一線、我們在河道中行走、所以覺得比較平穩些三時半遥見孤城一座、突現眼前、便知道我們已到了久以石油著名的延長了、</p>

<p>遂感許多困難矣、茲將逐日經過略述如左、以備留心西北者參考焉</p>
<p>八月十五日由西安出發南行五十里、晚宿於「引駕回」地方、沿途均屬平地、但天久不雨、農田盡荒、十村九空、誠有令人不忍卒覩之慨、惟愈近引駕回、村中樹木漸稠、低窪處偶見靑苗在焉、蓋愈近大山、則雨量較大、而濕度亦稍高故耳、引駕回地方虎疫之烈、爲空前僅見、該鎭人口不上千人、而日死於是疫者總不下三十餘人、一室之内、數人同死者、固屬常事、卽全家共死於疫者、亦不希罕、人民徒從事禱神、不講究衛生、以求預防方法、誠堪憫也、卽以本組人員而論、兵士及夫役染疫者、是日亦不下十餘人、幸團員均無恙、所苦者本組醫生葉君耳、</p>
<p>八月十六日自引駕回南行十五里、卽由「大石嘴」入秦嶺山脈矣、山行六十里、晚宿於半廟、由引駕回至大石嘴一段、仍爲平地、距山較近山水不觖、灌漑自易、故稻田玉蜀黍等、常呈一片靑色、誠爲入潼關後之僅見者、但各村虎威不減於引駕回、由大石嘴入山後、因近年來山居者大增、森林盡毁、林地改爲農田、山勢曲折、五步一灣、十步一轉、而山澗則轉輾於羣山之中、誠壯觀也、故所快者團員之脈、惟所苦者團員之腿耳、晚至半廟、天氣漸凉、非綿不暖、</p>
<p>八月十七日由半廟起程南行三十里、越八千尺高之秦嶺、再由嶺南下行三十餘里、晚宿於三里橋地方、是日所經各地、居民漸稀、森林較稠、吾人於不知不覺間己入大山氣候矣、當此時令、雨不大而繼續不斷、雲不淺常與行旅不便、嶺上有韓文公廟在焉、誠蘇氏所謂公之靈如水在地中、無處不有也、及至三里橋時、團員多赴山澗中之「天然池」内洗那不化分文之汽水澡誠旅中樂事也、晚間開會時、始知過去兩日、本組人員死於疫者、有兵士一人、夫役五人、會場中驟現一種悲痛狀况、</p>
<p>八月十八日由三里橋動身順乾祐河而南下、經過營盤鎭行八十里、晚宿於柞水縣南五里之石嘴子、經過營盤鎭時、人民恐吾人將疫氣從嶺北帶至嶺南、多焚雜草而驅逐癘氣、然則吾人己變爲瘟神矣、過柞水縣城時、見滿街高張標語、以示歡迎考察團、標語如「陜西實業考察團爲開發西北之先鋒」等、最奇者爲「歡迎中國科學社驅逐疫氣」等標語、</p>
<p>八月十九日在石嘴子停　一日、與該縣縣長建設局局長及法團代表開談話會、作一全縣調查統計、</p>
<p>八月二十日由石嘴子起程、除大隊順乾祐河南行經圪塔寺、於次日（二十一日）午時抵鎭安縣外、另由李德毅敎授組織一分隊、經雲蓋寺山道探查該地杯業狀况、該分隊亦於二十一日午時抵鎭安、與大隊復合、大隊經過各地由胡庶華主任領導考察該地銅鑛、採有標本、以待分析化騐、分隊所經各小道之森林狀况、實較他處爲佳、若云大規模開採、則不甚經濟、居民多種橡樹、其量可觀、及至鎭安縣城時、卽見滿街標語國旗高懸、其措辭與柞水相同、晚上與該縣縣長及各法團代表作一長時間談話、直至十二時、始盡歡而散</p>
<p>八月二十二日淸晨由鎭安起程南行、以次過宿靑銅閘西河關蔴坪河、共行三百六十里、而於二十五日晚、安抵安康縣城、茲將此四日中旅行經過槪述如左、</p>
<p>（甲）山路艱險　所經各地、每日路程旣長、山勢更險、所行路途、大都臨河小道、計其寃不過尺餘、偶爾失足、那有生還、卽以由西河關舟行四十里至趙家灣一段而論、危險萬狀、水流旣急且淺舟底與河石相擦成聲、急流之中、船頭常與岸石有相撞之虞、幸團員富冒險性、皆無難色、（乙）幸未遇匪吾人旣脫虎疫之威、然終日轉輾於險山之中、匪風不無可慮、本組旅行程序、因之亦有相當改良及準備、以防萬一、幸無意外、尙堪告慰各團員家愚、</p>
<p>（丙）種山問題開種山坡、爲戶口增加現象、此次所經各山、業已開種者、超過半數以上、其餘未開種者、或因經開過而不能再耕者、或爲多石之處不能開耕者、若常此以往、不設法補救、則山地愈開愈少、戶口則有增無减、數十年後、誠爲該處一大問題也、</p>
<p>二五十晚抵安康縣時、綏靖司令張飛生親出郊外相迎、入城已萬家燈火、標語滿壁、國旗諷揚、軍樂大作、此間盛况、亦不減於西安臨行時也、　　八月二十六日是日起停留安康凡兩日、二十六日晨休息、下午赴張飛生司令讌會、晚間與縣長各法團談話、二十七日晨五時、張司令請團員閱兵、及向兵士談話、午赴各法團讌會、並有當地土戯助興、下午各團員分赴郊外及各商店調查一切、最奇者、少數民衆竟視本團若八府巡按使然、有向本團請減輕雜稅者、有向本團控告土豪劣紳者、大約彼等均未明瞭本團之使命、要亦可憫也、安康縣城臨漢水南岸、爲由漢中運貨至漢口之孔道、昔時商務頗盛、民國十二年出口貨值己超過五百萬元以上、大商家有數十家之多、今因時局不靖、至漢口水道難通、竟成十門九閉之死市矣、望當局對鄂境内漢水交通再四注意焉、八月二十七日燈下記於安康城西第七中學）</p>

<h3 id="c20">小學訓育問題（下）吳增芥 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>二·怎樣養成兒童的良好行爲訓育不是呌學生腦子裏裝滿道德觀念、而是要把這種觀念和理想、表現出來、我們要看他是否明瞭德的意思、祗要看他能否照德目的思意做、根據這層意思、小學訓育、不是空空洞洞的講解道目、或組織兒童自治會舉幾個領袖負責就算了事、眞正的訓育、要個個學生都能分担全體活動的工作、個個兒童都有責任心、凡兒童能力所及的種種活動如出版新聞、維持秩序、管理圖書等等、各級學生、都要輪流着做、這樣、才能普遍的訓練、打破少數人活動、多數人被動的老例、</p>
<p>三·怎樣指導兒童現在一般小學對於兒童、行爲的指導、唯一的辦法、就是「善必有賞、惡必有罰、」好學生到了學期終了時、拿到許多奬品、心喪非常高興、壞學生便罰做苦工、「關夜學、」高聲叱責、甚至施以夏楚、賞罰究竟是最好的方法麽、用奬品鼓勵、容易養成驕傲的態度懲罰足以使兒童懷恨敎師、不信仰敎師、賞罰要不要用、有什麽方法可以替代、這些問題、都須研究、敎師對於兒童的指導、眼光要放得遠大、要從各方面着想、不能囿於成見、要知道頑皮的學生不一定就是無用的人、循規蹈短的、不一定是可造之才、活潑又與頑皮不同、這幾點敎師也得注意、</p>
<p>四·怎樣改善社會兒童有許多不良習慣、可說都是從成人學來的、别的不要說、就以淸潔和秩序兩點而論、小學生在校裏差不多天天聽到先生講淸潔、守秩序的重要、但一出校門、跑到街上、却到處很骯髒、很嘈雜、小孩子覺得講求淸潔和守秩序、不過是學校以内的事、出了校門、因爲大家都如此、就可以隨便、像這樣的心理、學校裏的訓育、還有什麽成效、小學敎師要知道訓育不是關住了校門做得成功的、要兒童有良好的行爲、要從成人做起、所以小學敎師、必得担負成人敎育的工作、把成人敎好了、再去訓練兒童、那才事半功倍、如果丢了成人敎育、講兒童訓練、那就事倍功半、</p>
<p>五·怎樣聯絡家庭要訓育著有成效、又必須聯絡家庭、家長和敎師對於兒童訓練、原是共同負責的、但事實上家長對於兒童的態度、和敎師對於兒童的態度不能一致、家長也許不知道怎樣訓導兒童、有的太嚴、有的太寛、有的父親和母親對於兒童的態度不一致、這些現象、都使學校訓育、發生困難、小學敎師應多做家庭訪問的工作、認可我們去遷就家長、不要坐在校裏等家長來、或開遊藝會丨美其名曰懇親會丨就算做了聯絡的工作</p>
<p>因篇幅有限、本文就此結束、小學訓育上的問題正多、敎師須隨時注意改進、願與小學敎育界諸同志共勉之、</p>

<p>蔡等預先登輪江海關監督唐海安·因輪船改於下午五時出口、預計蔣光鼐氏必可准時趕到、與蔡廷鍇等同船返閩、於是遂事先令江海關備鏡輝號小火輪、在江海關碼頭候用、蔣等一到、即可出發、同時爲鄭重計、特由江海關派水巡捕數名、會同淞滬警備司令部所派偵探七人、在碼頭上嚴密戒備、唐氏并親偕秘書在碼頭上守候、以便送行、奈蔣等至四時半、尙未聞有抵埠消息、唐氏因時間怱促、恐蔣蔡不及同船離滬、乃一面令江海關港務主任格林氏、向渣華公司接洽、再將該輪出口時間延長半小時、一面令秘書以電話通知蔡氏、請先行登船等候、蔡氏因於四時五十分、乘汽車至江海關碼頭、與唐海安等先行乘鏡輝號小火輪出發、至浦東藍烟囱碼頭、登芝尼加拿號輪船、候蔣同行、同時江海關另備鏡輝號小火輪、在碼頭等候、以備蔣氏乘坐、Ｉ</p>

<h3 id="c91">從戀愛說到靈草 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>戀愛本是個美滿名詞，可惜由變愛而得到美滿結果的，祇是個少數丨爲着熱戀而發生不幸事件，爲着失戀而聲明脫離夫婦關係的，差不多成了日報中的刻板文章：這是什麽緣故？</p>
<p>愛河多浪，好事多磨，這是戀愛過程中常有的事，本不足奇；但是，近來發生的戀愛慘變，多半用情不專，成了三角戀愛底下的犧牲者，不能諉之於天命說什麽愛河多浪，好事多磨。要救濟社會上這種種缺憾，一没有因熱戀而發生不幸，二没有因失戀而男女仳離：任憑一等那麽温的道德家或政治家，感化無從感化，禁止無從禁止，也只有抽一口冷氣，謹謝不敏罷了丨我在無意之中，從本草綱目拾遺上，見有離情草，和合情草的紀載：區區的一莖草，可以支配男女愛情的離合，這眞是救濟社會的靈草，熱戀和失戀的對症良藥了。我把兩種草的産地和效用，載在後面：</p>
<p>離情草，産在雲南夷地，士民多有鬻之者；凡人爲情慾錮蔽，往往致死：得此草一莖煎服之，入口即豁如夢覺，斷緣絶愛，亦不自知其所以然也。</p>
<p>合情草，産永昌府瀾滄江外，草根潔白，結男女交合狀；土人見之，用稻米周遭圍之，掘方可得，否則遁去，有夫婦不和者，服之即歡好，然載諸江船，輒沉溺不得渡：智者用長線繫諸岸側，持線登舟，渡畢，然後引過。故滇省近邊一帶，時時有之：聞服之者曰：男視女，雖嫫母，西子王嬙不若也。女視男，雖醜，亦潘安；雖老，亦健兒也。</p>
<p>以上，都是本草綱目拾遺的原文。假使，陶思瑾吃了離情草，便没有兩雌相殺的慘禍；熱戀黎妹妹的吃了離情草，也没有兩雄相殘的突變；而且閙不淸的離婚男女，都吃了合情草，便不會再打離婚官司，銅牌律師的生涯，也受了大大打擊了丨草木的效力，有這麽的偉大而靈異麽？只怕是一種草木的神話吧。</p>

<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>丨一切當求光明圓滿丨</p>
<p>中秋的月亮，最是光明，最是圓滿，所以也最受人欣賞，但是當我們欣賞光明圓滿的月亮時，應想到我們的國土如何？東北淪亡已經一年了，好比月的缺而不全，我們當努力奮鬥，還我山河，重光國，使我四百萬英方里之領土，光明無纎垢，圓滿無殘缺，一如中秋之月亮，又當想到我國之政治如何？今日之政治，黑暗得没有一線光明，支離破碎得不健全，我們當以民衆的力量，監督政府，使政治淸明，組織完滿，也象中秋之月的光明與圓滿，令人可愛，今日的社會，也像政治樣的組織不良，黑暗不堪，我們當以沈着的態度，銳敏的思想，堅强的意志，去改造社會，使它組織圓滿，大放光明，人們生活這社會裏，欣欣然像露立在中秋的月下，歷來的救國團體，終不免黑幕重重，不能收圓滿的結果，我們今後當如何健全其組織？當如何使各個心成爲整個呢？發生萬丈光芒，有圓滿結果的收穫，而也像今宵之月，轉輾東北的健兒，武器不完全，餉糈不充足，東數百人，西數千人，他們的作戰計劃是何等不圓滿，他們的前途是何等的黑暗可怕，我們當如何助以軍需，助以武器，予以一切物質上精神上之助力，在東北發出萬丈光芒，掃蕩陰霾，而收得圓滿的結果。總之，擺在我們目前的一切，都當求其光明與圓滿，求其如今宵明月之光明與圓滿，中秋之月的光明與圓滿固令人發生快感，目前的一切求得其光明與圓滿，更能使人感到快樂。</p>

<p>— 白石</p>
<p>烟霧彌漫的香斗，佈滿了一屋子，這便是象徵東北的義軍，拼命的發出烟彈藥霧，打倒日本帝國主義。但是想到了一到半夜香斗點完時，烟霧就消滅了，不禁不寒而慄。</p>
<p>藕斷絲不斷，這本是一句俗語。不料今年中秋吃藕，這句俗語，却象徵了東北情形。滿洲國己由日人造成，老百姓依然不忘故國，那分明是藕斷絲不斷。但是想到把藕送進嘴的時候，不斷的絲，也要斷了。更爲之不寒而慄。</p>
<p>月餅。是中秋不可少的點綴品，同時也正可象徵中國的國勢。中國宛如一個整個的月餅。東也租界，西也殖民地，正如被人剝去了皮屑。現在日人索性獅子大開口，一口咬去了東北一大塊，餅　也露出來了。而且給他咬剩的，日人尙鑱涎欲滴。言念及此，我益覺慄慄自危。</p>

<p>秋來了，在都市，是不會感到秋的肅殺的，要有，也祇是趕着秋節禮物的餽送，和賞中秋所應用的物品，那蓮蓉百果的廣東月餅，伴着在凉爽的皓月底下可人的秋意，這，和着公子小姐鑒賞着春天裏的鮮「花」，夏季雨後初霽七色的「虹」，和着這「一輪明月」秋夜賞月詩意的濃郁和凉人胸腑的寒意，這是應該使人忘去千倍煩惱萬倍愁的時候丨</p>

<p>「那你做了團長，」一定是很快樂的了；也許你的故鄉和以前的一切，不再有價值，使你偶然地迥憶？」</p>
<p>「什麽！我有一息之存，不會把以前的陳跡遺亡；我有一些些的靈機，我總在想怎樣使我的好芬若快樂。你應該知道在你决定要出嫁的那天，我心裏是怎樣的難受，但是我不願意學一般人的懦弱呑安眠藥片，或投海去自殺：我只想如何懲戒你，使你在某一個時間，遇到某一個環境，覺得嫁這個營長，完全是錯誤，而適應家中人的要求與期望，也是絶大的謬誤；我還自己信任自己，决不是一個敎書匠的胚子，一定可以像中國之所謂上馬殺賊，下馬草露布；或者像西洋中古武士般的神勇，或在某一個時期之内，把你掠奪到我處，是從你丈夫的手中。咳丨當時是這樣地的憤激，全身的血，都呈了沸狀；而你呢，正在享受新婚之快樂，有另外一個男子，偎倚着你，擁抱着你，怎知道你的罪人，是抛棄了一切逃到軍隊中去呢？」</p>
<p>「是的，這是我的過失，也是我自己的不幸；但是現在呢，一切都完了，我除了祝禱你永久得到幸福，替國家人民盡責以外，什麽心思都没有了。」</p>
<p>「那麽你一輩子過這樣生活都無怨了？」</p>
<p>「我不能再怨誰：怨自己的命·也是毫無意識。美麗的靑年，像流水一般地已經過去，我不預備再希求什麽，在斷氣之前。」</p>
<p>「但是你不希求什麽，難道也不許我有什麽希求？」</p>
<p>「這當然是例外，你應該有更大的希求，嬌妻，聰明的孩子，震驚全世界」</p>
<p>和拯救全人類墮落的工作，你該希求，你該達到你底目的：但是你不該再到這裏來，遇到你以前不幸的朋友。」</p>
<p>「你的思想，不能再使它更美麗一些和以前一樣麽？你的生活，不能使它愉快一些，超過巳往和現在的樣子麽？以前我的憤激，現在巳變爲切望，以前的舊恨，我願意一切都忘掉，但是我不願忘掉你待我的熱情，我不信你的靑年巳過去，我現在眼前所見到的，依舊是十三年前美麗的好芬若。我不願你一輩子受苦，永久和瘋人住在一塊兒，不願你永遠給别人家女兒繡嫁衣裳；我想蹤見你將被我所擁抱，將爲了我而給你自己繡一件嫁有。」</p>
<p>「咳丨你原諒我吧，我雖然只嫁了兩個月，丈夫便死掉，孤苦零丁，以至於現在，中間兩家的家族親戚，都慢慢地死去，只剩　了一個無聊而不死的我，但是我想在未斷氣之前，拯救一個人，這個人便是那個瘋子，可憐伊也是一個可憐虫，請你容許我，不要反對我或剝奪我的意志；但是你的情意，我將帶到我的棺木裏去，永遠地感激。」</p>

<p>— 寄生蟲</p>
<p>九、七、本報本埠附刋銓君畫的一張揷畫，上面畫了一個和尙，團坐着敲木魚，旁邊題了『社會之寄生蟲』六字，我看了不禁爲和尙大聲呌屈，我並不是同情於和尙這種專靠募化來坐着吃用，我又並非來替和尙張目，打抱不平，不過因銓君題了「社會之寄生蟲」六字，我心裏覺得銓君的責備，未免偏重，因爲我們中國的寄生蟲，豈止和尙，而和尙之中，又豈無生産者，現在我單把上海來說一說，一般住洋房吃大菜坐汽車的，整天游手好閒，不做事情，及一般想做事情，而社會不給他們事做，驅强者以打家刦舍，弱者以悲鳴行乞的擱置不談，單就上至行政長官，下至販夫市儈，試問那一個是生産者，如果認爲這一般是不生産的，那末請問呌他是什麽？不是社會之寄生蟲是些什麽？而且這些寄生蟲，除了低級員　黃包車夫之外，他們的生活，要比卜晝卜夜的生産工農同胞，舒適得多，上海多少人口，我却不得底細，而寄生者與被寄生者，固又答不出一個準確比例，但照現狀看來，我可武斷一句，百分之一之比，一定是差不多「寄生者九十九人被寄生者一人」而且這些高等寄生蟲，自己不生産，不要去說，她却還要拼命地消費到外國去，「買外國貨」使自己寄生在上面的一般被寄生的生産同胞，有産不能生，豈不欲同歸於盡，</p>
<p>我這篇拙文，並非指摘銓君這張畫稿的意思不對，實在因銓君這題字社會之寄生蟲而引起我胸中久欲傾吐而未曾吐的一個社會觀念，（却酬）</p>

<p>照這樣看來時間與空間，確是一樣的重要。</p>
<p>現在我再舉幾個例子來說明這四度空間。</p>
<p>關於一度空間的，我們差不多是不很常見，不過我曾見過這樣的一叚故事是：一隻螳螂正在路上走着·前面忽來了某將軍的一輛車子，但牠却還是很勇敢地前進、毫不避讓，於是牠就犧牲了，這個故事原是說螳螂的勇敢，但或些是螳螂對於二度或三度空間還没有相當的認識的緣故。</p>
<p>關於二度空間我記得古時有這樣的一句話是，劃圈爲牢，就是說把一個犯有過失的人的四週，只消劃一個圈，他就會永遠地站在那裏，這是表示古人的誠實，不過我們細細地考慮起來，這或些是古人思想的簡單，他們只知道有二度空間，對於三度空間或些還没有發現，還没有相當的認識。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>至於三度空間，我們的生活就是在三度空間中。</p>
<p>中國人對於四度空間還没有相當的認識。</p>
<p>從前我曾聽過這樣的一個笑話：有一個人在路上走，忽然遇到大雨，但他却還是慢呑呑地踱着，有人問他爲什麽不快一點跑，他的答覆是前面也在下雨何必要跑得快呢。</p>
<p>聽了這樣的一個故事，我們决不能說他是個　子，他的說話中間，的確也有哲理的存在，他的話並没有什麽錯誤，不過我們只能說，他對於四度空間還没有相當的認識。</p>
<p>中國人對於第四度空間，確是缺少認识，就是以文字而言，英法德諸國的文字中都有時間性，中國是没有的。</p>
<p>中國人開會時常遲到，這或些也是個證明</p>
<p>現在第五度空間又將近發現了，科學落伍的中國，對於四度空間，至少應有相當的覺悟。</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3 id="c116">改良會計之建議 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣繼融</p>
<p>會計學者，以科學之方法，研究記賬原理之學術也，考中國商店工廠，採取新式會計者，固屬不多；即用半新式者，亦甚寥寥：大多數商號，仍用舊式之單式會計，以記其日常之賬項而已，憶丨吾國商店，因記賬不明，從中作弊而發生種種問題者，不知凡幾，工廠出品，或因成本計算不確，而競爭失敗者，又不知凡幾，以至家庭方面，因收入支出，事前旣少預算，事後又無决算，而傾家蕩産者，亦不知凡幾。當茲國難方殷之秋，工商衰落之際，各業裁員之時，提倡國貨之中，改良會計，更不宜遲。况黨治之下，經濟公開，已成例案，若不從速改良，而一仍舊貫：競爭其能優勝乎？經濟其能公開乎？家庭其能寛裕乎？茲擬數條，以資參考：</p>
<p>（一）現在社會各機關，對於會計一席，非親即眷：或有請會計師審查者，其意亦不過欲免外人之諮議耳。故爲會計師者，當以公正無私之精神，精密審查，詳細報告：勿使一班民衆，失其信仰，而會計事業前途，有所妨磚也。</p>
<p>（二）中國爲世界之商場，競爭之烈，不言而喻。吾國工業，方在萌芽，政府旣少提倡，又無保護，欲與外商競爭，難矣。際此提倡國貨之時；吾國商人，應改良出品，應售價低廉，務使「價廉物美，」以合羣衆之心理。惟新式成本會計，是求蓋成本計算而正確，則於最低之賣價中，仍有相當之盈利，故吾國各工廠各商家，不特有採用新式會計之必要，且在較大之工廠中，應設立成本會計研究部，使成本低而售價廉；，則銷貨因時而增加，國産因此而推廣，其收效之宏，可預卜也。</p>
<p>（三）會計師公會，爲研究會計學之樞紐，益當常有關於會計之各種出版物，以資商業上之參考，藉資鼓勵。爲會計師者，勿高抬身價，亦應取給從廉，俾欺期普及。</p>
<p>（四）學校爲培植未來之人才，今後尤應加添簿記與會計一科，以供給社會之需要，商店與工廠，更應盡量用學校畢業生，以便改良，而利進行，即在家庭，亦切實用也。</p>
<p>（五）各埠商會，亦應聘請會計家，或聯合會計師公會。共同討論會計問題·使一班商民，得明瞭新式會計之原理與利益。並隨時指導，促其改良。若能如是，則其效果更大矣。</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3 id="c117">一個中學生 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>本學期，我們敎室裏：多了一個驀生的面孔，他那臉上塗得像石灰般的白，只差没有搽上一點胭脂，口紅，否則眞和女性差不多呢？身上香水灑得香氣襲人，眞是一股紈袴的氣派，他自己說以前在Ｓ大學讀書，快要畢業了，因爲要弄張中學文憑，所以托我們校長的小舅子介紹來的？</p>
<p>這位屁精先生，（同學公送的綽號）把讀書不當做一回事，大槪他忘記了來校的本意，所以他每天至多上二小時課，不過有一點許多同學是很佩服他的？就是儘他怎樣缺課：大菜單上却從没有他的大名，</p>
<p>他每天是這樣的浪費着，早上六時從外面（跳舞塲）回來：就上床睡覺，非到十點半不起身，所以九到十一的二課他是從來没有上過，只有正式上課的一天是例外……十一點到十二點的一課總算來敎室裏坐坐，但，不是看報就在看小說，很少的留意在書本子上·他一聽見散課鐘打了，倒先敎師而出！……</p>
<p>他雖然是膳宿的，可是飯堂裏從不見他露過臉：只有校門對過ＸＸ軒裏倒可以找到的，（當然嗎！他們公子哥兒：校裏的飯菜怎配胃口呢？）</p>
<p>下午一點到二點：似乎還能勉强上課，一到二點以後，就不再來敎室裏了，據在他隔壁一間的Ｌ說：在二時半就有一個敎戲的：帶着鳥師來唱女起解等，最不可解的，這時舍監也像聾了耳朶的人，一響不響，反正其他宿舍裏要是這樣就得受他干涉，這一點我也不得不認爲這位屁先生神通廣大？三時以後天天有一個摩登女郎來找他，於是就一同出外，不到天亮不回來。</p>
<p>唉！這種學生並不是眞心來求學，恐只是掛掛牌吧？而學校當局竟然也能容留這社會的蠧蟲般底學生，也眞是一件怪事，唉，敎育敎育，竟然敎出這樣的學生來！</p>

<p>— 士本</p>
<p>前天從館裏回家，走進弄堂，只見隔壁張家的門前，站着許多婦女在交頭接耳的談話，大家的視線，又都射向裏邊，似乎有怎麽好看的把戲，舉得大衆這樣地注意似的，不覺好奇心起，踱過去一看，只見張家客堂中間，坐着一位五十左右的老婆子，看她打扮，身上穿着一件長可過膝的靑布單衫，脚上穿着一雙有紅布鞋拔的鞋子，耳跟上掛着和銅元大的一副圓脚環子，頭上梳着一個高聳在頭頂的元寳式髮髻，在她這副古怪的十八世紀裝束看來，知道她是一個三姑六婆中的一份子呢，她身邊圍坐着五六個年輕婦女，都側着耳，在靜聽她的說法，張媽媽的大媳婦，正在全神貫注地和她談話，「奶奶！八字我也算過了，毛病我也明白了，命裏是注定着有的，不過能不能今年就見喜？那末，待我問一問靈官看呢？」那老婆子說着，探手入懷，摸出一個寸許長的木偶，放在自己耳邊，像聽電話般地聽了一回，繼續說道，「靈官說，你命裏得子很遲·要到三十八歲，還得望十年功夫，」</p>
<p>「老婆婆！那嗎，請你再問問靈官，有怎麽法子好想？」張家大媳婦，求子心切，顧不得怎麽難爲情，而這樣說着，但是一張雪白的臉上，早已紅雲朶朶了，</p>
<p>「……」老婆子嘴唇一顫一動，似乎在默唸怎麽咒語，手裏的木偶，又不住地塞到耳際去接吻，一会兒，說道，「靈官巳經說過了，和你種一個好了，不過要你助香燭鈿四元，…牠呌我給你麒麟送子丸八粒，你在八月中秋下半夜，用開水冲入香灰，服下肚去，那時，靈官在暗裏，和你種一個白白胖胖的官官了，」</p>
<p>「噲！婆婆！價鈿太大，阿好减少些嗎？」張家大媳，兒子要想養，銅鈿倒有些肉麻，</p>
<p>「奶奶！你不明白了，這個銅鈿，不是我用的，是靈官買香燭用的，你也不要說了，靈官說出的話，從來没有二話的啊丨」老婆子這樣眞不二價的胡謅着說，</p>
<p>「那嗎丨銅鈿憑你四元，不過請你求靈官快些…」，張家大媳，說到這里，難爲情起來，就不說下去，忙着在身邊摸出大洋四塊，授給那婆子，</p>
<p>「奶奶放心，我們做事，向來不拆爛汚的，包你來年現在，小官官捧在手裏，那時我還要來呷杯喜酒哩丨一老婆子滿臉笑容，顯着勝利的情緖，邊說邊將四只老洋，往懷裏塞去，</p>
<p>「靈官，……種一個白白胖胖的官官，……香燭……Ｘ塊洋鈿……一一霎時，由西弄楊家客堂裏，傳出這樣一種聲音，</p>
<p>無生路</p>
<h3 id="c119">梅英 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 人仄</p>
<p>梅英因爲經濟的關係，不能不輟學了，眼見同學們都快樂地夾着書包小校去，自己却留在家裏過那寂寞的生活。　　但是能夠在家裏舒適地過日子。倒也好了。因爲受了麫包的驅使，生活的鞭子一下一下的打在背上，又不得不逼迫着走上謀生的路道。</p>
<p>她的母親代她找到了一件工作，在一家烟草公司裏做女工。</p>
<p>第一天早晨上工時，她携了一隻食籃，走出門來，她是如何的羞慚丨因爲恐怕遇見熟識的人，祇得低下了頭，揀冷靜的路走。</p>
<p>在廠裏，因爲梅英是生手，當然免不掉要受工頭和其餘的女工的奚落。就是别人在說笑時，梅英也認爲是在訕笑自己。</p>
<p>吃飯時·梅英把食籃打開，一碗飯一碗菜，梅英一看，不由心裏一酸，暗暗地流下幾滴淚來。恐怕給人家看見，只得將眼睛抹了一抹，勉强吃了幾口飯，又重復把食籃蓋好。</p>
<p>嗚，嗚，嗚丨氣笛鳴了三聲，工人放工了：許多的人，都擁擠着，走了出來。梅英也跟着在内。</p>
<p>在路上，她滿懷着悲哀，走着走着，竟不知不覺地到了黃浦灘邊。她心裏想：「咦丨怎麽會走到此地來呢？唉丨想起來眞令人起無限感慨呢丨父親和母親是如何的愛我，現在爲了生活的鞭策，却抛頭露面來做這種工作，還要受人們的嘲笑。唉丨唉丨在這世界裏，那裏還找得到同情呢？明天，後天，我將受着同樣的難堪，呌我如何是好呢？」</p>
<p>想到這裏，她底淚水像泉般湧着，滴滿了衣衫，滴上了地上。</p>
<p>許久許久，她止住了悲哀，轉而一想：「唉！這種世界還有什麽留戀呢？倒不如一死來得乾凈，就是父親和母親也可以减少許多痛苦。」</p>
<p>想罷，便放了食籃，向着江水，將身一縱。</p>
<p>黃浦的江水，流着流着，呑没了梅英，祇起了幾個漩渦，又如常地永恒地流着。</p>

<p>— 君恒</p>
<p>因爲生殖的關係，性的需要，是當然人人免不了的，不過，衣食無靠的告化子，有了一妻還不算數，也要學學那達官貴人們弄上一個小老婆，這倒不可不一記，</p>
<p>我有個朋友在陸家浜路上，開了一爿小雜貨店，我常常到他那裏去談天，他們隔壁有一間矮平房，也就是乞丐的住宅、日昨，當我正在同我那朋友閒談的時候，砰的一聲，這是茶碗打碎的聲音，接着就是三個衣衫襤褸的男女，扭成一團，從那矮平房裏打出來，一個四十多歲的女的，指着那三十來歲鼻子裏流着血的女的，駡道：「你這爛汚Ｘ，我同他是十幾年的夫妻，向來是很和睦的，自從你迷住了他，他就抛棄了我，我今天非把你的Ｘ撕豁了不算一又撲上去一把抓住了那三十來歲的女的頭髮，一隻脚又去踢那男的，後來總算被他們的鄰居勸開了，這一塲醋海風波才告平靜丨</p>
<p>我那朋友說：那男的每天用紅臘燭油和麵粉化裝着爛腿上街上去要錢，每天總要弄到兩三吊錢，那三十來歲的女的，也是到各衖堂裏裝着找尋丈夫，哭哭啼啼地眞像很可憐的樣子，所以有時候還能騙到三四塊錢一天，她就是他新近姘上的，算是小老婆，那四十多歲的女的，是告地狀要錢，是他的大老婆，我那朋友又說：我這小小的雜貨店，眞不如他們呢，他們還放印子錢呢丨</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Crisis of Japan's Recognition of the Puppet State <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The bizarre drama of Japan's recognition of the puppet state has, after much fanfare, entered its main act. Before today, China had tried its best to prevent the opening of this bizarre drama, and those in the world who uphold justice had also unanimously expressed their disapproval of this bizarre drama appearing on the world stage. However, the military dictatorship of Japan disregarded the resolute opposition of the entire Chinese nation and went against the common opinion of the world, not showing the slightest restraint, resulting in today's actions. Therefore, today, China has no choice but to vow to deny it to the death and to implement its stated stance with force. There is no need to say more. If the major powers truly want to avoid world chaos as a result, they should exert their power of international sanctions against Japan without delay.</p>
<p>China has made repeated statements regarding Japan's creation of a puppet state and its unreasonable recognition of it. In his remarks rebutting Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida's speech on August 29th, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan stated even more seriously that China would never give up an inch of its territory or a part of its sovereignty due to military pressure. At the same time, it is determined to resist military aggression with all its strength. This is the legitimate attitude expressed by the Chinese diplomatic authorities based on the public opinion of the people. Now that Japan's recognition of the puppet state has become a reality, the Chinese people are determined to urge the government to use force to recover the land and sovereignty of the Northeast, and at the same time, to do their best to save themselves. Although the success or failure is difficult to predict, judging from the current situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army's activities, it is clear that the Chinese people are unwilling to easily give up the land that has been invaded and occupied for no reason, and are determined to do their best to deal with the enemy. This is what we must solemnly express to the world today, at the opening of this bizarre drama.</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the Northeast Incident, the international community should have imposed the necessary sanctions on Japan. The reason why the force of sanctions has not been exerted so far is nothing more than to appease the present and temporarily maintain peace in Asia. However, we believe that the biggest reasons why the Asian continent has been able to enjoy a relatively stable situation in the past are: first, the internal economic instability of the major powers; and second, the constraints of the balance of power among the major powers in China. Now, if the major powers in China take actions that are not in line with public morality in this time of extreme global economic panic, the Chinese people, driven by righteous indignation, will be willing to sacrifice themselves. The result may not only fail to help countries overcome the problem of overproduction, but may even accelerate the collapse of the world economy. Furthermore, now that Japan has monopolized the Northeast, acquiring abundant war materials, the major powers are all the more likely to have direct conflicts. Once the competition for rights and interests is triggered, it will be difficult to maintain the current state of peace. People have recently feared that the Northeast issue will become the fuse for a second world war, and this is the reason. Now, if Japan implements the recognition of the puppet state, how can it be guaranteed that it will not become the fuse for a second world war? How will world and Far Eastern peace be maintained? This is what must be recognized even more strongly today, at the opening of this bizarre drama.</p>
<p>When Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, he silently recited "Peace, Struggle, Save China," and in his will, he also instructed the entire nation to "...unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and struggle together." If the major powers cannot uphold justice and force us into a desperate situation where we have nowhere to turn, then the people of our country, with no other recourse, will have to rise up and unite with Russia or unite with the small and weak nations of the world to embark on the path of common struggle, and unpredictable changes may occur, changes that the major powers cannot foresee.</p>
<p>Therefore, observing from the above aspects, after Japan's recognition of the puppet state, if our country does not immediately launch a military expedition, or if the major powers do not make a fair judgment, then the future of world peace is truly worrying. The major powers themselves should not be too optimistic. Today, we can only do our best to save ourselves and help ourselves, but for the sake of the friendly countries of the world, "saving others is the way to save oneself, helping others is the way to help oneself." Do not be blinded by short-term gains and confused by long-term harm, so that world peace may be able to achieve the effect of mending the fold after the sheep is lost. Otherwise, once a major change occurs, those who will be directly affected will not only be China.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' serious protest against the Japanese government's recognition of the Northeast puppet organization will be submitted to the Japanese side on the 15th, and the full text will be published. The content of the protest details the facts before and after Japan's forceful seizure of the Eastern Provinces to the recognition of the puppet organization, and solemnly denies that the existing organization in the Eastern Provinces under the military occupation of the Japanese army is illegal. The puppet organization established has no qualification to conclude treaties with any country, as it is not a national entity. The Japanese government's destruction of China's territorial integrity and recognition of the puppet state is a violation of the sacred obligations and responsibilities of a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also decided to send similar notes to the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and other seven countries of the Nine-Power Treaty on the 15th, detailing the facts of Japan's military invasion and occupation of our Eastern Provinces and its organization and creation of a puppet state after the September 18th Incident, and stating our country's consistent efforts to maintain peace in the Far East and its adherence to all international treaties. The Chinese government deeply regrets Japan's announcement of its recognition of the puppet state, which violates Articles 1 and 2 of the Nine-Power Treaty, and should request the governments of the countries that signed the treaty to pay serious attention to the sacred responsibilities they bear under the treaty. The Chinese government is extremely willing to hear advice on how to maintain the dignity and effectiveness of the treaty. (14th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The original text of the Japan-Manchukuo Treaty was originally planned to be notified to various countries before the signing, but it has been firmly decided that there is no need to formally notify various countries. The original text will be published tomorrow simultaneously with Foreign Minister Uchida's remarks. As for sending a copy of this treaty to Geneva for filing, it is currently considered unnecessary, but it may be necessary to do so in the future. Officials stated that this document, which is written in Chinese and Japanese, is a kind of protocol, not a treaty. It is reported that the contents of this protocol are the same as those reported on September 2, except for slight changes in the wording. In the future, it will still be necessary to conclude a military agreement in order to stipulate the details of the military clauses contained in the protocol, and it will also be necessary to conclude a commercial treaty. According to the contents of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol reported on September 2, it includes clauses such as mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and Japan's right to station troops in various parts of the Three Eastern Provinces and to assume the responsibility for "Manchukuo's" internal and external defense.

If Japanese coal further reduces its price, the Qingdao sales market will also be seized, and coal merchants will go bankrupt. Han said that the coal surcharge of three jiao and seven fen per ton has been abolished.

<p>Competing for Control of the South Manchuria Railway</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the China Press, 14th: Since Hayashi Hirotarō took over as president of the South Manchuria Railway Company, internal affairs have been in great disarray. Many of the 30,000 employees sympathize with young military officers, advocating internal reforms to prevent financial cliques from monopolizing huge profits. They propose that new directors should be selected from among the employees. President Hayashi is in a dilemma in Tokyo. It is rumored that the military has recommended Lieutenant General Yamauchi Shizuo of the Army to serve as advisor to the South Manchuria Railway and Colonel Kōmoto Daisaku of the Army Reserve to serve as a director, thereby militarizing the railway and giving the military all practical power. On the other hand, the Japanese government has recommended Ota Kataro, director of the Building and Repairs Division of the Ministry of Finance, Tomita Tsuta, director of the Finance Division, Ōbuchi no Ki, head of the Tokyo branch of the South Manchuria Railway, and Gunji Mikaeru, director of the Shenyang office, for selection. The conflict between the military and financial cliques is currently intense, and the situation remains chaotic.

<p>German Prime Minister Refuses to Attend</p>
<p>Permanent Committee of the Reichstag</p>
<p>Speaker and President Engage in Written Battle</p>
<p>Causing Constitutional Conflict</p>
<p>Various Parties Begin Preparing for Elections</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from the National Press, 13th: Since the sudden dissolution of the German Reichstag, the constitutional dispute has erupted like a raging tide, with each side attacking the other for violating the constitution. Although Reichstag Speaker Göring has effectively abandoned the dispute over the invalidity of the dissolution order, he still insists that the voting procedure on the Communist Party's motion of no confidence was completely legal. Therefore, the emergency decrees issued on September 4th and 5th have been revoked. However, the cabinet strongly denies this fallacy and has informed the Reichstag's Permanent Committee that if Göring does not change his view, cabinet members will refuse to attend the Permanent Committee meetings. As a result, all members of the Permanent Committee except for the German National People's Party passed multiple motions, one of which was to request the Prime Minister to attend the committee meeting. When the Prime Minister did not attend, they proceeded to accuse the Prime Minister of openly violating the constitution and decided to report to the President. They also passed a motion from the Centre Party to re-examine whether the Reichstag dissolution order was legal. The reasoning differed from that of the National Socialist Party, arguing that the wording of the order was of a preventive nature, intended to prevent the Reichstag from exercising its constitutional right to revoke the emergency decrees, so the question of its validity has arisen. In addition, there was another point of conflict. Last night, the police, without the consent of the Reichstag authorities, entered the Reichstag to search the Communist Party's offices. The police claimed that they had received a confidential report from a reliable source that the Communist Party was plotting to blow up the Reichstag, so they could not wait. However, the search yielded only a few documents and a book, with no other contraband. As a result, the Reichstag's Permanent Committee passed another strong protest, condemning this action as a violation of the Reichstag's immunity from ordinary judicial searches. They also passed a motion requesting the government to announce the date of the Reichstag re-election. Late in the evening, the government published the correspondence between the Reichstag Speaker and the President regarding the Permanent Committee's resolution accusing the Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior of not attending, which caused shock both within and outside the government. The Speaker's letter violated the usual etiquette, lacking both the formal address at the beginning and the respectful closing. The President's reply severely condemned the preposterous accusations, stating that if Speaker Göring had followed the Reichstag's rules of procedure and constitutional conventions, all disputes would not have arisen. Late at night, the government issued a statement explaining the whole matter, stating that there was no doubt about the validity of the Reichstag dissolution order and the invalidity of the Communist Party's motion of no confidence, because, in the government's opinion, the voting on the motion took place after the Reichstag had already been dissolved. Currently, cabinet members cannot attend Reichstag committee meetings until the Reichstag authorities and the Permanent Committee clearly acknowledge this fact. (Note that the Permanent Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee continue to exist as usual after the Reichstag dissolution.) In addition, they refuted the Permanent Committee's inappropriate citation of Article 25 of the Constitution and cited the example of former President Ebert dissolving the first Reichstag. Late into the night, Speaker Göring sent another lengthy letter to the President, this time with the formal address and respectful closing, as usual. The content was a defense of the voting procedure on the motion of no confidence, which fully complied with Reichstag law, so the emergency decrees issued on September 4th and 5th were invalid. He declared that although he acknowledged that the Reichstag had been dissolved, he could not accept the view that the dissolution was justified and legal. His reasons were different from before, claiming that according to the Republican Constitution, the Reichstag could not be dissolved twice within the same specified term. As for how the government will respond to this letter, it has not been announced as it is late at night.</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from Reuters, 14th: German parties are no longer discussing the legality of the Reichstag dissolution. They are all fully engaged in election planning. The Social Democratic Party has issued its first declaration to the nation, and the radical parties are all preparing. However, the National Socialist Party is not focusing on issuing declarations, etc. They are now seeking ways to expedite the elections. According to the constitution, the elections must be held before November 6th.</p>

We have accepted all means to avoid armed conflict. Today, we informed the Committee of Neutral Nations that we are prepared to accept a ceasefire proposal once it is received. Paraguay has strictly complied with the obligations it owes to the member states of the League of Nations and members of civilized society. This is something we can be confident of."</p>
<p>Unrest in Brazil Continues</p>
<p>Revolution Breaks Out Again in Chile</p>
<p>Interim President Forced to Step Down</p>
<p>Buenos Aires Dispatch from Havas, 13th: According to news from the capital of Brazil, the disturbances in various regions of Brazil, which are allied with the rebel army of São Paulo, are increasing daily. The government has claimed that these disturbances have been suppressed by government troops, but military operations near the capital and Minas Gerais and other places have not stopped. The government has sent reinforcements to suppress the rebels in Santa Catarina.</p>
<p>Santiago Dispatch from Reuters, 13th: Chile has experienced several revolutions and counter-revolutions in recent months, and now another revolution has occurred, this time bloodlessly. Today, Air Force Commander Merino, relying on military force, sent an ultimatum to President Dávila, giving him until 4:00 p.m. to resign or he would bomb the presidential palace. The letter accused Dávila of deviating from socialism and harming the poor. Dávila yielded and submitted his resignation. He is said to have taken refuge in the US embassy here because Dávila had previously served as the Chilean ambassador to the United States. Merino has established an interim government, with General Blanco, the commander-in-chief of the army, as the acting president.</p>
<p>Assassin of French President</p>
<p>Russian Criminal Executed on the Guillotine</p>
<p>Escorted to the Execution Ground in the Early Morning Dawn</p>
<p>Remembers His Motherland Before Execution</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch from the National Press, 14th: The Russian criminal Goguloff, the assassin of former French President Doumer, was executed on the guillotine outside the Santey Prison in Paris this morning. At approximately 6:03 a.m., the blade fell, and the head and body fell into separate baskets. The execution was completed in five minutes, and the body was taken away by horse-drawn carriage and buried in the Ivry Cemetery. Thousands of people watched the execution, but due to the strict security and the speed of the execution, few were able to witness the execution.</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch from Havas, 14th: Goguloff, the assassin of the former French President, was executed at 5:52 a.m. this morning. The crowd was unprecedentedly large. Since last night, the crowd had gathered, and barriers were set up 40 meters from the execution ground to prevent the crowd from rushing in, so about 1,500 spectators were blocked from seeing the execution. Last night at 2:00 a.m., the execution stake was erected, and the executioner and his assistants, all dressed in white cloth shirts and trousers, made their final preparations. A scaffold was set up a few meters away, appearing as a black shadow in the clear night. The execution stake was set up in front of the prison wall between two elm trees, behind which was a white wooden fence. During the night, Goguloff slept peacefully in his narrow bed in the prison, like an ordinary person. Another prisoner shared the same room with him. The lights in the room remained on all night, and the guards constantly peered through the gaps in the door to observe the prisoner's sleeping state. At 4:30 a.m., Dr. Paul, a forensic doctor, arrived at the prison. Soon after, the Prosecutor General of the French Republic and the prisoner's defense lawyers, Rérolle and Roger, also arrived. Before entering the prison cell, Rérolle told reporters that Goguloff's wife intended to retrieve her husband's body. Soon after, the executioner reported to the judge that the execution procedures were ready. Then, they urged the criminal to wake up. When the judge entered the room, the prisoner was still sound asleep. When the judge called him to wake up, the prisoner heard the noise from outside, but showed no sign of panic. After a moment, he seemed to realize something and mumbled a few words. Then, the prisoner changed into a wide-necked shirt, and the executioners cut off some of the long hair hanging down from his neck. At this time, the guards at the execution ground all drew their swords. The street lights were extinguished, and the executioners surrounding the scaffold, along with their two main assistants, were now dressed in black and wore skullcaps. The prisoner was given a religious salvation ceremony by a priest and quietly listened to Mass, followed by baptism. Then, he uttered a few words, saying, "I am neither a royalist nor a communist. I die for my cause, just like all the peasants in Russia who are oppressed by the Reds." The prisoner drank two glasses of red wine, but refused the cigarettes offered. Afterwards, the prisoner entered the execution ground with the priest and his defense lawyers. At this time, he said to those around him, "Please tell my wife that I love her very much. I have caused my wife to suffer. I beg her to forgive me, and I hope that my wife can raise our soon-to-be-born child to adulthood and that he will continue to believe in my cause in the future. Now, I am dying for this good cause." After speaking, Goguloff revealed his strong chest in front of the scaffold, with no expression on his face. The two executioner's assistants helped him down, as Goguloff's legs were tied and he could not climb down the ladder. When approaching the scaffold, Goguloff's attitude was different from that of ordinary criminals. He only stared at the execution machine, without showing any fear. At that time, Goguloff spoke softly to himself, but it could be heard clearly, saying, "Please forgive me." The priest covered the prisoner's head with the sleeve of his black robe, so as not to distress him by seeing the guillotine. The priest then embraced the prisoner, and Rérolle kissed the prisoner goodbye. After the executioners had set up the execution machine, the prisoner was still heard muttering to himself, saying, "Oh, France, my motherland." Then, with a sudden sound, the blade fell, and the execution was extremely quick, very different from usual. It took less than ten seconds from start to finish. By 6:05 a.m., the execution ground on the Avenue d'Arago had been cleaned, the scaffold had been dismantled, and the barriers on the road had been removed. The spectators who had waited for a long time, having seen nothing, returned disappointed. In a short time, the execution site was covered with fresh sand, leaving no trace to be found.</p>
<p>Match King</p>
<p>Engaged in Scams Before His Death</p>
<p>Liquidator Releases Preliminary Report</p>
<p>Stockholm Dispatch from Reuters, 13th: The preliminary report of the liquidator of the estate of Match King Kreuger was published in the newspapers today, referring to Kreuger as a criminal, not a businessman. The report analyzes the large-scale scams set up by Kreuger, saying that Kreuger thought of himself as a great man, but he was not. Kreuger, after failing to maintain his nominal business, engaged in fabricating rumors of huge profits in order to maintain the impression of his financial stability. What distinguished him from ordinary people was that he was a criminal. The directors of Kreuger &amp; Toll knew that Kreuger's various reports and documents regarding the company's position were false.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Zhao Pi-lian Passes Through Jinan on His Way to Beijing <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Central Committee member Zhao Pi-lian passed through Jinan at 9:30 this morning (the 13th) on the Pǔpǔ Line Train No. 201, representing Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Taiyuan, to make contact with the Central Government. I interviewed him on the train, asking about his mission in Beijing. Zhao said, "I don't have any particular mission on this trip to Beijing. However, in this time of national crisis, those who bear the responsibility of the Central Government must gather in Nanjing and work together to overcome the national crisis. I will also report to the Central Government on the recent situation in Shanxi on behalf of Commissioner Yan. I will also take the opportunity to discuss matters such as Central Government's financial assistance to the Shanxi military. I will not be leaving Beijing and returning north in the short term." I asked how Commissioner Yan views the overall situation. Zhao replied that Commissioner Yan sincerely hopes that everyone will unite to resist foreign aggression. Yan previously returned to Hebian Village to care for his father, who was ill. He has now recovered, so he has returned to Taiyuan. Zhang Qun recently went to Taiyuan from Pingjin and met with Yan several times. He has now returned to Hankou. Regarding the overall situation in North China, the Central Government probably has concrete plans. I asked about the military pay of the various armies in Shanxi. He replied that the Central Government had previously promised to provide 600,000 yuan per month to Shanxi, but due to financial difficulties, it has not been allocated. As for the guest armies, such as those of Sun Dianying, Song Zheyuan, and Pang Bingxun, Director Zhang (Xueliang) provided some financial assistance each month during the period of the Beiping Pacification Office. Zhang Renjie and Bao Gang's armies raised funds locally. The original armies stationed in Shanxi were supplied by the provincial government. After the establishment of the Taiyuan Pacification Office, its powers were divided with the Beiping Pacification Office, and the Central Government promised to provide another 100,000 yuan per month to the Shanxi armies, but it has also not been allocated. Because Shanxi is poor and has financial difficulties, I am going to Beijing this time to request the Central Government to expedite the allocation. I asked about the recent floods in Shanxi. Zhao replied that the Fen River flooded this year, and 30 or 40 counties along the river were affected. It was partial, not completely flooded. The southern gate of Taiyuan was also flooded due to the breaching of the Fen River dam. When the floodwaters rose, the garrisoned troops in the city closed the city gates to prevent flooding, fortunately avoiding being flooded. Previously, a few counties in southern Shanxi had a widespread tiger plague, but it has now subsided somewhat. I asked where the remnants of Liu Guitang's bandits are currently operating. He replied that the remnants of Liu Guitang's bandits were previously in the Ling Shou area on the border of Shanxi and Hebei. They never entered Shanxi. They have now moved to the Chahar-Suiyuan area. There are few bandits in Shanxi. It is quite peaceful. (September 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Bandit Situation in Anhui Province Gradually Being Eliminated <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The bandit forces of Quan Guangyi and Zhang Da-bizi in Anhui Province, after merging, disturbed the areas of Tongcheng and Lujiang. The provincial government sent the police second brigade, Ni Regiment, to join the Tongcheng, Lujiang, and Shu counties militias to suppress them. Later, it was decided to request support from the 33rd Brigade, led by Brigade Commander Tang Yunshan, and sent a regiment of troops to assist. Tang also went to command. The original plan was to encircle and annihilate them, but the strength of the militias near the Chaohu Lake in Lujiang was somewhat weak, so the bandits fled in that direction. The Ni Regiment is currently pursuing them. The Tang Brigade has advanced to Lujiang, approaching the border of Shucheng County. Yesterday, the provincial government received a telegram from Xiong Gonglie of Tongcheng, stating that Zhang's bandits, after fleeing north from Shaxi, were closely pursued by the Ni Regiment to the vicinity of Pingdingshan in Forty Forts, where they engaged in fierce fighting. The Tang Brigade had set out from Dongtangchi on the 8th, preparing to launch a head-on attack. As for the Shucheng area, Liang Guanying, the commander-in-chief of the 25th Route Army, telegraphed the provincial government, stating that the Zheng and Liu Brigades of the route army had successively recovered Jiugongzhai, Lianghekou, Heishidu, Daxiao Yiling, Xindianhe, Bangedian, and other places, and were currently eliminating the remaining bandits and resettling the displaced. Provincial Chairman Wu Zhongxin has sent a telegram of commendation. As for the Liuan area, Wang Jun also telegraphed the provincial government, stating that the Red bandits had been repeatedly defeated and had concentrated their forces to retreat and defend Mabou. The 19th, 21st, and 33rd Brigades were deployed to advance on Xianghuling, Shajiawan, and other places, breaking through the first and second lines of defense of the bandit area, engaging in day and night hand-to-hand combat, and completely recovering Mabou. Several thousand bandits were killed in this battle. The units are now attacking Majialing, Yangjiadian, and other places. Jinjiazai has been surrounded and will be captured soon. As for the sporadic small bandits in Tongcheng and Wuwei, the provincial government has also sent the Wang Battalion of the first regiment of the second police brigade and Liao Yunze, the chief of the first section of the Security Office, to the Liujiadu, Xiang'an, and Huanggutun areas to search and suppress them.

<p>Only Two and a Half Portions of Life</p>
<p>"Riding a horse or sailing a boat is only worth three portions of life," but the danger of riding in a "jiawo" (a type of covered litter) from Fushi to Ganguyu is only worth two and a half portions of life. These were the heartfelt words of Liu Chenghou, Deputy Director of the North Group, when he arrived at the Ganguyu residence at 5:00 PM on August 30th. Indeed, the road that day (the 30th) was not particularly difficult, but the experiences of each person were extremely dangerous. I still remember that day, at 7:30 AM, our donkeys, horses, and "jiawo" carriages, swaying and swaggering, marched out of Fushi city gate in a grand manner. In less than three or four minutes, one of the donkeys pulling my "jiawo" carriage suddenly started dancing as if it were listening to music in the Shanghai La Fei Garden. I felt that something was amiss and immediately got out of the "jiawo" to walk. However, Mr. Huang Bokui, a mining magnate with profound feelings, insisted on exchanging places with me. I could not refuse out of politeness and had to agree. Unexpectedly, both the front and rear donkeys pulling the "jiawo" started dancing simultaneously midway. The "jiawo" carriage immediately overturned. Onlookers were very worried for Mr. Huang, but fortunately, he was not injured. At 1:00 PM, after our break at Shiyaodianzi (resting place) was over, the "jiawo" carriage of Feng Huanzhang, a councilor of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, was crossing the river when the "jiawo" carriage reached the middle of the stream. The front donkey and the following donkey did not cooperate, and the front donkey broke away from the "jiawo" and went its own way. Mr. Feng almost fell into the water and was in great danger. In addition to this, Mr. Zhu Jierui fell from his horse and injured his foot severely. Although he asked the group doctor, Mr. Hu Tingyu, to treat him, he still looked like an iron-crutch immortal when he walked.</p>
<p>Ganguyu was just an overnight stop between Fushi and Yanchang. Because Fushi and Yanchang are 160 "li" apart, and we only traveled eighty or ninety "li" each day, we stayed overnight in a small school in Ganguyu. The next morning (the 31st), when we got up to hit the road, everyone was on guard. Therefore, when the donkeys pulling the "jiawo" carriages reached the edge of the cliffs, they also felt the urge to dance. Then our lives would be in danger. For a time, the number of people abandoning the "jiawo" carriages and walking increased significantly. Sure enough, midway, the "jiawo" carriage of the agriculturalist, Mr. Li Yongxing, suddenly did a 180-degree flip. The contents of the boxes were scattered all over the place in the most vivid detail. Fortunately, Mr. Li had already joined the walkers and escaped this disaster. Otherwise, he would have at least grazed some skin on his forehead and suffered a false alarm.</p>
<p>After breaking at Heijiabao at 12:00 PM, most of us believed that the overturned "jiawo" carriages were a warning and decided to walk. However, the mountains stood tall and steep, and the roadsides were full of stone slabs, making it difficult to walk. We desperately pushed forward and, after about an hour, ran to Xihazigou. Because the river was dry, the water flow was only as narrow as a line. We walked in the riverbed, so it felt relatively smooth. At 3:30 PM, we saw a solitary city in the distance, suddenly appearing before our eyes. We knew that we had arrived at Yanchang, which has long been famous for its oil.</p>
<p>Since we left Xi'an, we have kept accurate records of the altitude, temperature, and climate of various places. Now that we have passed the halfway point of our journey, I will copy out the records for reference:</p>

<p>The Shaanxi Industrial Survey Group split into two groups, North and South, to set out on their surveys. The North Group's survey report has already been published daily in the newspapers. Now, the first report of the South Group is disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>August 15th was the date on which the North and South groups of the Shaanxi Industrial Survey Group simultaneously departed from Xi'an. On that morning, the heads of various departments of the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the director of the Longhai Railway Administration all came to the departure point to bid farewell to the members of each group, making it quite a grand occasion.

<p>Therefore, many difficulties were felt. The daily progress is briefly described below for the reference of those who are concerned about the Northwest.</p>
<p>On August 15th, the group departed from Xi'an and traveled 50 "li" south, spending the night in a place called "Yinjiahui." The entire route was flat, but due to the prolonged lack of rain, the farmland was barren, and nine out of ten villages were empty. It was truly unbearable to witness. However, the closer to Yinjiahui, the denser the trees in the villages became, and seedlings could occasionally be seen in the low-lying areas. This was because the closer to the mountains, the greater the rainfall and the slightly higher the humidity. The severity of the tiger epidemic in Yinjiahui was unprecedented. The town had a population of no more than a thousand people, but the daily death toll from the epidemic was no less than thirty people. It was common for several people to die in the same room, and it was not uncommon for entire families to die from the epidemic. The people only engaged in praying to gods and did not pay attention to hygiene to seek preventive methods. It was truly pitiful. Even among the members of our group, no fewer than ten soldiers and laborers contracted the epidemic that day. Fortunately, the group members were all unharmed, except for Dr. Ye.</p>
<p>On August 16th, the group traveled 15 "li" south from Yinjiahui and entered the Qinling Mountains through "Dashizui." The group traveled 60 "li" in the mountains and spent the night in Banmiao. The section from Yinjiahui to Dashizui was still flat. The mountains were close, and the water was abundant, making irrigation easy. Therefore, rice paddies and cornfields were often a patch of green, which was truly a rare sight after entering Tongguan. However, the ferocity of the tigers in each village was no less than in Yinjiahui. After entering the mountains from Dashizui, the number of people living in the mountains has greatly increased in recent years, and the forests have been completely destroyed. Forest land has been converted into farmland. The mountains twisted and turned, with a bend every five steps and a turn every ten steps. The mountain streams wound through the mountains, which was truly spectacular. Therefore, what pleased the members was the scenery, but what troubled the members were their legs. When the group reached Banmiao in the evening, the weather gradually cooled, and it was impossible to keep warm without cotton-padded clothing.</p>
<p>On August 17th, the group set off from Banmiao and traveled 30 "li" south, crossing the 8,000-foot-high Qinling Mountains, and then traveled more than 30 "li" down the south side of the mountains, spending the night in Sanliqiao. In the areas traversed that day, the residents gradually became sparse, and the forests became denser. Unknowingly, we had entered the mountainous climate. At this time of year, the rain was not heavy but continuous, and the clouds were not shallow, often causing inconvenience to travelers. There was a Han Yu Temple on the ridge, which was truly as Su Shi said, "The spirit of the Duke is like water in the ground, everywhere." When the group reached Sanliqiao, many members went to the "natural pool" in the mountain stream to take a soda bath that did not cost a penny, which was truly a pleasure on the journey. At the meeting in the evening, it was learned that one soldier and five laborers from our group had died from the epidemic in the past two days. A sorrowful atmosphere suddenly appeared in the meeting place.</p>
<p>On August 18th, the group set off from Sanliqiao and went south along the Ganyou River, passing through Yingpanzhen and traveling 80 "li", spending the night in Shizuizi, five "li" south of Zhashui County. When the group passed through Yingpanzhen, the people feared that we would bring the epidemic from the north of the mountains to the south of the mountains, so they burned weeds to drive away the plague. So we had become plague gods. When the group passed through Zhashui County, we saw slogans posted all over the streets to welcome the survey group. The slogans included "The Shaanxi Industrial Survey Group is the Pioneer of Northwest Development," etc. The most bizarre slogan was "Welcome the China Science Society to Drive Away the Plague," etc.</p>
<p>On August 19th, the group stopped in Shizuizi for a day, and held a discussion meeting with the county magistrate, the director of the Construction Bureau, and the representatives of the legal entities to make a county-wide survey and statistics.</p>
<p>On August 20th, the group set off from Shizuizi. In addition to the main group traveling south along the Ganyou River, passing through Guta Temple and arriving in Zhen'an County at noon the next day (the 21st), Professor Li Deyi organized a detachment to explore the local cup industry situation through the Yungaisi mountain road. The detachment also arrived in Zhen'an at noon on the 21st and rejoined the main group. The main group, led by Director Hu Shuhua, investigated the local copper mines in various places, collected samples, and waited for analysis and testing. The forest conditions of the small roads passed by the detachment were indeed better than in other places. If large-scale mining were considered, it would not be very economical. Residents mostly planted oak trees, and the quantity was considerable. When the group arrived in Zhen'an County, slogans and national flags were seen all over the streets, and the wording was the same as in Zhashui. In the evening, a lengthy discussion was held with the county magistrate and representatives of various legal entities until 12:00 AM, when everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 22nd, the group set off from Zhen'an and traveled south, passing through Qingtongzha, Xiheguan, and Mapinghe, totaling 360 "li", and arrived in Ankang County on the evening of the 25th. The travel experience during these four days is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The mountain roads were difficult and dangerous. The daily journey in the traversed areas was long, and the mountains were even more dangerous. The roads traveled were mostly small paths along the river, which were only a foot or so wide. An accidental misstep would lead to no chance of survival. Take the 40 "li" journey from Xiheguan by boat to Zhaojiawan as an example. It was extremely dangerous. The water flow was rapid and shallow, and the bottom of the boat rubbed against the river stones, making a sound. In the rapids, the bow of the boat often ran the risk of colliding with the rocks on the shore. Fortunately, the group members were adventurous and had no difficulties. (B) Fortunately, the group did not encounter bandits. Although the group had escaped the threat of the tiger epidemic, there was still concern about bandits in the dangerous mountains all day long. The group's travel procedures were therefore appropriately improved and prepared for any eventuality. Fortunately, there were no accidents, which was comforting to the families of the group members.</p>
<p>(C) The problem of planting mountains. Opening up mountain slopes for planting is a phenomenon of population increase. More than half of the mountains that the group passed through had already been opened up for planting. The remaining uncultivated areas were either because they had been cultivated and could no longer be farmed, or because they were too rocky to be cultivated. If this continued without finding a remedy, the amount of mountain land would decrease, while the population would increase. After several decades, this would truly be a major problem in the area.</p>
<p>On the evening of the twenty-fifth, when the group arrived in Ankang County, Commander Zhang Feisheng personally came to the suburbs to greet them. By the time they entered the city, thousands of homes were lit up, slogans covered the walls, national flags fluttered in the wind, and military music was played. The grandeur here was no less than when the group departed from Xi'an. From August 26th, the group stayed in Ankang for two days. On the morning of the 26th, they rested, and in the afternoon, they attended a banquet hosted by Commander Zhang Feisheng. In the evening, they talked with the county magistrate and various legal entities. At 5:00 AM on the 27th, Commander Zhang invited the group members to review the troops and talk to the soldiers. At noon, they attended a banquet hosted by various legal entities, and local operas were performed for entertainment. In the afternoon, the group members went to the suburbs and various shops to investigate everything. The most bizarre thing was that a few people even regarded the group as if they were imperial envoys. Some asked the group to reduce miscellaneous taxes, and some accused local tyrants and evil gentry. It is estimated that they did not understand the group's mission, which was also pitiful. Ankang County is located on the south bank of the Han River and is a major thoroughfare for transporting goods from Hanzhong to Hankou. In the past, business was quite prosperous. In 1923, the value of exported goods exceeded 5 million yuan. There were dozens of large businesses. Now, due to the unstable situation and the difficulty of the waterway to Hankou, it has become a dying market with nine out of ten doors closed. It is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention to the Han River transportation in Hubei Province. (Recorded at the Seventh Middle School in the west of Ankang City on August 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Extension of the Longhai Railway to the East Section <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province Plans Commercial Port Locations</p>
<p>The eastern extension of the Longhai Railway is expected to open to traffic to Xugou by the end of this year. In the spring of next year, after the Sunjiashan Tunnel is completed, it can open to traffic to Laoyao, and a wharf will be built there. It is expected to be completed in two or three months. At the 528th meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, regarding the Longhai Railway Bureau's plan to set up commercial areas in Xugou, Laoyao, and other places along the route, the locations for establishing commercial ports were planned in detail. It was resolved to have the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Industry jointly review the plan, which would be convened by the Construction Department. This type of construction is extremely important to the prosperity of northern Jiangsu. The original letter from the Longhai Railway Bureau to the Jiangsu Provincial Government is recorded as follows: "Regarding the construction of a wharf by this bureau in Xugou, the situation has been reported to your government in previous letters. The survey procedures are nearing completion, and the earthwork and stonework of the roadbed have already begun. It is expected that traffic to Xugou can open by the end of this year. In the spring of next year, after the Sunjiashan Tunnel is completed, traffic can open to Laoyao, and the wharf there will also be completed and open for transport in two or three months. At this time, there will inevitably be many travelers and merchants coming and going, but it is necessary to have the facilities for hotels and warehouses to accommodate them. However, the area around Xugou is extremely remote, with few villages. If the government designates the commercial area in advance and plans for the safety of land and water in advance, merchants will not be suspicious and will naturally be eager to invest and engage in construction. Your government has far-sighted vision and strives for construction. All of these facilities must have been planned in detail to meet the expectations of the people. The railway and the local area are an integrated whole, sharing weal and woe. Has your government considered designating the location for the establishment of a commercial port, or is it anticipated when it can be opened? Please provide detailed information so that the railway administration can also promote it at the same time and share the optimistic success."</p>

<p>Changing the Method of Accepting Mortgaged Silkworm Cocoons and Reorganizing Jiangsu and Zhejiang Factories</p>
<p>The Silk and Silkworm Cocoon Committee previously stipulated the method for cleaning up old silkworm cocoons. Anyone who transported old silkworm cocoons from warehouses to factories for silk reeling, whether their own cocoons or commissioned silk reeling, should report to the committee in writing in advance, and a certificate would be issued after the investigation stock confirmed that there were no errors. Now, the deadline for the export subsidy for old silk is approaching, with only four months left until the end of the year, and the relationship between the mortgaged funds and the pledged funds is extremely important. It is necessary to strive for convenience in terms of procedures. The method has been changed. In the future, if old silkworm cocoons are to be shipped to warehouse owners, the cargo owner may request a certificate from the warehouse stating the number of the warehouse receipt, the number of packages shipped, and the date of shipment, and send it directly to the committee to issue a silk reeling certificate. Yesterday, the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi Silk Factories Association was notified to inform the factories to check and handle.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Problems in Elementary School Moral Education (Part 2) by Wu Zengjie <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>2. How to Cultivate Good Behavior in Children: Moral education is not about filling students' minds with moral concepts, but about expressing these concepts and ideals. We need to see if they understand the meaning of morality by observing whether they can act according to moral principles. Based on this understanding, elementary school moral education is not just empty lectures on moral precepts or the organization of children's self-governance societies with a few leaders in charge. True moral education requires every student to share in the work of collective activities, and every child to have a sense of responsibility. All kinds of activities within the reach of children's abilities, such as publishing news, maintaining order, and managing libraries, should be done in rotation by students of all grades. In this way, universal training can be achieved, breaking the old pattern of a few people being active and the majority being passive.</p>
<p>3. How to Guide Children: The only methods generally used in elementary schools to guide children's behavior are "good deeds must be rewarded, and bad deeds must be punished." Good students receive many prizes at the end of the semester and are very happy, while bad students are punished with hard labor, "detention," loud scolding, and even corporal punishment. Are rewards and punishments the best methods? Encouraging with prizes easily fosters pride, while punishment can cause children to resent teachers and lose faith in them. Should rewards and punishments be used? What methods can replace them? These questions need to be studied. Teachers should have a broad vision when guiding children and should consider all aspects. They should not be bound by preconceived notions. They should know that naughty students are not necessarily useless people, and those who follow the rules are not necessarily talented. Teachers should also pay attention to the difference between liveliness and naughtiness.</p>
<p>4. How to Improve Society: Many bad habits of children can be said to be learned from adults. Not to mention other things, let's take cleanliness and order as examples. Elementary school students hear their teachers talk about the importance of cleanliness and order almost every day at school. But as soon as they leave school and go to the streets, they find it dirty and noisy everywhere. Children feel that emphasizing cleanliness and order is only a matter within the school. Outside the school, because everyone is like that, they can be casual. With this kind of mentality, what effect can school moral education have? Elementary school teachers should know that moral education cannot be successfully done by closing the school gates. To have children with good behavior, it must start with adults. Therefore, elementary school teachers must take on the work of adult education. Only by educating adults well can they train children with greater success. If adult education is abandoned and only children's training is emphasized, it will be a case of doing twice the work with half the results.</p>
<p>5. How to Connect with Families: To make moral education effective, it is also necessary to connect with families. Parents and teachers are jointly responsible for children's training, but in reality, parents' attitudes toward children and teachers' attitudes toward children cannot be consistent. Parents may not know how to guide children, some are too strict, some are too lenient, and some fathers and mothers have inconsistent attitudes toward children. These phenomena make school moral education difficult. Elementary school teachers should do more home visits. We should go to accommodate the parents, not sit in the school and wait for the parents to come, or hold entertainment programs, ostensibly called "parent-teacher conferences," and think that we have done the work of connection.</p>
<p>Due to limited space, this article ends here. There are many problems in elementary school moral education, and teachers must pay attention to improvement at all times. I would like to share this with my colleagues in the elementary school education community.</p>

<p>Lost 4-0 to the Municipal First Team</p>
<p>The Twentieth Army football team visited the Songhu war zone today and played a basketball game with the refereeing association in the evening. They will leave Shanghai for Hangzhou tomorrow. Therefore, yesterday afternoon's football match with the Municipal First Sports Field team was their last battle. According to the record of the Twentieth Army football team's performance in Shanghai, wins and losses were mixed, neither profitable nor unprofitable. Therefore, yesterday's game was quite related to the team's overall account. However, the Municipal First Army had a tough attitude, continued their efforts, and developed a one-sided situation, winning 4-0, which was quite unexpected. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After the lower team Shuwei Yinjiao sounded, the two armies formed their positions, intending to attack. The Municipal First Center forward first passed the ball, and the left and right armies communicated and passed it, reaching the Sichuan army's penalty area, like a gust of wind and rain. Left forward Huang Guorong got the ball in a hurry and shot against the momentum. The ball immediately went into the net, killing a power display, in less than two minutes.</p>
<p>Shooting from afar at the gate, preparing for the battle, the Municipal First's arrogance increased, but the Sichuan army did not show weakness. Left forward Ma Zuyin was particularly brave and active, but the Municipal First left midfielder Ding Zhaocheng watched him very closely, and the hero had almost no place to use his skills. Since the Municipal First's front army had no worries about internal defense, they bravely attacked directly. The Sichuan army welcomed and rejected them separately, and the position gradually became chaotic. The Municipal First left inside player Fu Zhibin shot a ball from afar, directly penetrating the gate, making the score 2-0.</p>
<p>Scoring three consecutive goals, the Sichuan army suffered a setback, and their momentum declined slightly, while the Municipal First's front army's attack became more urgent. Center Chen Liang, left and right midfielders Yang Guozhen and Ding Zhaocheng all crossed the gap and welcomed and sent each other according to the opportunity. In a short time, the Municipal First Army was again in the Sichuan Army's penalty area, rushing from left to right. As a result, Wang Boyong got the supply from Cao Qiuting and turned around to sweep and shoot, scoring three goals in a row.</p>
<p>The Sichuan army worked hard. After the Sichuan army suffered heavy losses, they worked hard to attack fiercely. Liu Ximeng led the three armies, came in a long drive, and surrounded the three sides. Suddenly, a ball flew straight to the upper left corner of the Municipal First's goal. Goalkeeper Wang Jingen jumped and grabbed it, kicked it out, and the crisis passed.</p>
<p>Unfeeling feet, after the lemon, Municipal First left inside guard Zheng Zhiyun came on the field, united with Lu Yongxi, the wall was more solid, and the Sichuan army's momentum was even more depressed, and within the territory, it was often trampled by the Municipal First Army. In this situation of being besieged on all sides, Mai Youliang's feet were unfeeling, and he took the opportunity of a corner kick to score another goal.</p>
<p>Close to dusk, the battle was mixed. At this time, it was dusk, and the color was vast. The Sichuan army defended with all its strength and had no intention of attacking, and the critical situation had not diminished slightly. Blocking from the left and right, it was extremely chaotic. Three penalty kicks were not hit, which can also be said to be fortunate.</p>

<p>Song Ziwen and Chen Gongbo Talk</p>
<p>The Central Government Decides to Suppress the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>The National Government Has Already Decided on a Concrete Plan</p>
<p>A Clear Order Will Be Issued After the Publication of the League of Nations Report</p>
<p>A Protest Has Been Lodged with Japan and a Note Has Been Sent to the Washington Treaty Countries</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the Japanese Privy Council formally approved the recognition of the puppet organization, the central government decided not only to lodge a stern protest with Japan but also to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty to draw the attention of the signatory countries to Japan's invasion of the Northeast and its blatant disregard for everything by formally recognizing the puppet organization. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan, at his residence yesterday to inquire whether the National Government would issue an order to suppress the puppet organization immediately after Japan announced its recognition of the puppet organization on the 15th. According to Song, the suppression of the puppet organization is not because Japan recognizes it. All rebels must be suppressed. The National Government is determined to suppress the puppet organization in the Northeast. According to Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, the central government has already decided on a concrete plan for suppressing the puppet organization in the Northeast. The reason for the discussion at yesterday's Executive Yuan meeting was that the League of Nations hoped not to complicate the Northeast problem before the publication of the investigation report. Therefore, the National Government's clear order to suppress may be issued after the publication of the League of Nations investigation report. As for Japan's absurd move, it clearly violates the Nine-Power Treaty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will lodge a serious protest and send a note to the signatory countries of the treaty, asking them to pay special attention.</p>

<p>Jointly Telegraphed the League of Nations</p>
<p>Upholding Justice and Maintaining Conventions</p>
<p>Sanction Japan for Recognizing the Puppet State</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, and the Shanghai Money Trade Association sent two telegrams yesterday regarding Japan's recognition of the Manchurian puppet state: (1) Minister Luo and Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, please forward to the Secretariat of the League of Nations in Geneva. Japan's recognition of the Manchurian puppet state further proves the destruction of China's territorial sovereignty and integrity. Our country strongly opposes this. We hope that you will uphold justice, uphold conventions, and quickly impose sanctions to maintain world peace. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of China, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, and the Shanghai Money Trade Association respectfully kowtow. (2) Sent to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing. Japan's recognition of the puppet state further proves the destruction of our country's territorial sovereignty and integrity. The affiliated associations have jointly telegraphed the League of Nations, requesting sanctions. We earnestly request a strict protest and hope that the whole country will unite and fight against foreign enemies to save the country from danger. We are waiting for orders. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of China, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, and the Shanghai Money Trade Association respectfully kowtow.</p>
<h3 id="e35">The Tragic September 18th <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>City Government Dispatches Police for Prevention</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Announces Half-Mast Flags</p>
<p>The anniversary of the September 18th National Humiliation is approaching, and coupled with Japan's open recognition of the puppet organization, compatriots across the country will undoubtedly feel even more grief. The municipal authorities are deeply concerned that excessive public outrage may lead to excessive actions, necessitating precautions. All sectors have decided to hold mourning ceremonies on that day. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Expresses its View: A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency went to the municipal government yesterday to inquire about the prevention measures for the September 18th commemoration. According to the person in charge of the municipal government, if the commemoration of September 18th in this city can be carried out with calm and solemn actions amidst grief and fervor, there is no need for prevention. However, it is inevitable that hot-blooded youths and patriotic people may become overly激動 and exceed the limits, leading to disturbances. At the same time, reactionary elements taking the opportunity to make trouble is also a concern. Therefore, in order to maintain order, police force will be increased and strict precautions will be taken before and after September 18th, so that the entire city can commemorate in an orderly manner and avoid unexpected events. As for the Japanese newspapers' reports that 5,000 troops have been added in the Zhenru area and that our country is actively purchasing military equipment for conflict with Japan, these are all deliberate attempts by Japanese news to provoke feelings between the two countries and make the situation worse. In fact, no troops have been added to this city. At this time of international turbulence, it is truly regrettable that the Japanese newspapers suddenly have such inaccurate news reports.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Notice: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all industry associations and store members in the city, stating that the Shenyang Incident will soon be a year old, and the three northeastern provinces have fallen into foreign hands. All of our citizens should emulate themselves with unwavering determination to avoid the pain of China's downfall. Therefore, the entire city is gathered, and the Youth Propaganda Team is borrowed to hold a National Humiliation Commemoration Meeting on the morning of September 18th at 9:00 AM. It is hoped that all industry associations will send two representatives to attend the meeting at that time. All stores in the city should also fly flags at half-mast for one day to express the grief of the entire country.</p>
<p>Fasting to Express Sorrow: Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese Vocational Education Society has done its utmost for practical national salvation work. Recently, it launched a monthly donation campaign based on salary size to support the Northeast Volunteer Army, with the aim of sustaining the resistance force. The movement in this city has been vigorous, and the accumulated amount is quite considerable. Yesterday, the society received a telegram from representatives of various national salvation organizations in Beiping, Yan Baohang and Cha Liangzhao, which stated that the local organizations proposed a national noon fasting on September 18th to express the determination to recover lost territory. Various organizations, schools, institutions, families, and individuals should voluntarily hand over the saved meal expenses to local trust institutions, banks, or newspapers for collection and remittance to the Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association to help the suffering compatriots in the Northeast. It is requested that this be promoted in Shanghai to promote public spirit. After discussion, all expressed their support. Those who signed up to join included Huang Renzhi, Liu Zhanen, Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, Yao Huiquan, etc., all the staff of the headquarters, and personnel from various affiliated institutions, totaling more than a thousand people. The noon meal expenses saved at that time will be approximately over one hundred yuan, which will be given to the Northeast Refugee Relief Association.</p>

<p>Japanese Troops Stationed in Shanghai on Alert</p>
<p>After the Japanese government announced its recognition of the puppet organization, the Japanese military and political authorities in this city, with the approaching of September 18th, were increasingly afraid of arousing resentment among the Chinese people, so they became more actively on alert. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Armored Vehicles Deployed in Two Locations: The Japanese Shanghai Daily News published on the evening of the 14th that the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, with the impending recognition of Manchukuo (puppet state) and the upcoming September 18th National Humiliation commemoration, fearing that the Chinese people would express themselves, has been preparing everything for several days before. The areas under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai have been divided into two areas, east and west. The so-called east refers to the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, while the west is near Caojiadu. Each part is assigned a large squadron of armored vehicles to guard everything.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Anchored in the Huangpu River: The entire fifteenth squadron of torpedo boats has arrived in Shanghai. The four destroyers of the twenty-fourth squadron, "Yanagi," "Momo," "Hinoki," and "Kashiwa," are anchored at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The cruiser "Tenryu," the gunboat "Toba," and the first-class destroyer "Urakaze" are all anchored in the Huangpu River with the flagship "Izumo."</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Notifies Residents: The China United News Agency reported from this city on the 14th that the Japanese consulate issued a notice to Japanese residents, stating that within this week, they should not go to the French Concession and Nanshi lightly to avoid accidental disasters. Due to the Japanese recognition of the puppet state and the upcoming September 18th commemoration day, it is feared that public outrage will be aroused and unexpected changes will occur. Japanese people are asked to be cautious. It is heard that the Public Concession and the French Concession will implement a special curfew order on the 18th.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Jiang and Cai Return to Fujian on the Same Ship <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Arrives by Plane from Hankou</p>
<p>Fan Qiwu and Many Others Travel Together</p>
<p>Jiang Guangnai, the Director of Pacification of Fujian Province, after being summoned to Hankou by telegram by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek the day before yesterday, originally intended to delay his return to Fujian until the next sailing date. However, because the next sailing date was too long, he contacted Tang Hai'an, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, who agreed to change the ship's departure time to the afternoon. Therefore, Jiang was able to arrive in Shanghai from Hankou at 4:00 PM and returned to Fujian on the same ship with Cai Tingkai and others at 5:30 PM. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Ship's Departure Changed to the Afternoon: When Jiang went to Hankou the day before yesterday, the ship "Zhini Jiana" was scheduled to depart at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Due to the lack of time, he originally planned to change to the next ship leaving Shanghai. Later, after Tang Hai'an, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, contacted the Zhawa Shipping Company, the company agreed to change the ship's departure time to 5:00 PM in the afternoon. Therefore, after Jiang received a telegram in Hankou, he came to Shanghai at his leisure. However, due to bad weather on the way, the arrival time in Shanghai was delayed. The ship further extended the departure time by half an hour, and Jiang arrived.</p>
<p>Cai and Others Board the Ship in Advance: Tang Hai'an, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, because the ship was changed to depart at 5:00 PM in the afternoon, anticipated that Jiang Guangnai would arrive on time and return to Fujian on the same ship with Cai Tingkai and others. Therefore, he ordered the Jianghai Customs to prepare the "Jinghui" steamboat in advance to wait at the Jianghai Customs pier. As soon as Jiang and others arrived, they could set off. At the same time, for the sake of solemnity, several water patrol officers were specially dispatched by the Jianghai Customs, together with seven detectives sent by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, to be strictly on guard at the pier. Tang also personally accompanied his secretary to wait at the pier to see them off. However, Jiang and others had not arrived at 4:30 PM. Tang, due to the urgency of time, feared that Jiang and Cai would not be able to leave Shanghai on the same ship. He ordered Green, the port director of the Jianghai Customs, to contact the Zhawa Company to extend the ship's departure time by another half an hour, and at the same time ordered his secretary to notify Cai and ask him to board the ship first to wait. Cai arrived at the Jianghai Customs pier in a car at 4:50 PM and first took the "Jinghui" steamboat with Tang Hai'an and others to the Pudong Landian Chimney Pier to board the "Zhini Jiana" to wait for Jiang to arrive. At the same time, the Jianghai Customs prepared another "Jinghui" steamboat to wait at the pier for Jiang to take. I</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>Jiang Rushes to Arrive by Plane: After Jiang Guangnai received the telegram in Hankou, he took the Song's aircraft "Saikesi" to Shanghai at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Due to poor weather along the way, the aircraft flew very low and slowly. It usually takes four hours to travel from Hankou to Nanjing, but Jiang and others did not arrive in Nanjing until 2:30 PM. By the time they arrived at the Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai, it was already 4:10 PM. Acting President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen, Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu, and Song's secretary Huang Chundao all went to the airport to welcome him. Jiang's visit was also to convey Chairman Chiang's opinions on comforting Wang Jingwei and reorganizing the Fujian provincial government to Song Ziwen and others. After Jiang got off the plane, he left the Hongqiao Airport in the same car with Song and Chen. Song and Chen inquired in detail in the car about Chairman Chiang's opinions on the reorganization of Fujian Province. Lu Wenlan, who returned to Shanghai on the same plane as Jiang, was unable to travel with Jiang and Cai due to time constraints, so he returned to his residence to rest.</p>
<p>Jiang and Cai Leave Shanghai on the Same Ship: Jiang left the airport in the same car with Song and Chen at 4:15 PM and arrived at the Jianghai Customs pier at 5:10 PM. He then transferred to the prepared "Jinghui" steamboat to cross the river. Song Ziwen, Chen Mingshu, and Secretary Huang Chundao sent him to the Jianghai Customs pier, bid farewell to Jiang, and returned. Jiang arrived at the Pudong Landian Chimney Pier at 5:25 PM and left Shanghai on the "Zhini Jiana" with Cai Tingkai and others to return to Fujian.</p>
<p>Jiang Guangnai's Remarks: After General Jiang Guangnai boarded the Jingguang ship, he entered the cabin to rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency also entered the cabin and asked Jiang about the results of his visit to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. According to Jiang, his meeting with the chairman was entirely to report and discuss military affairs and pacification matters in Fujian Province. The reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government was not discussed. As for the military expenses of the 19th Route Army being supplied by the central government, Mr. Cai had already discussed this with Chiang during his previous meeting. The plan for suppressing bandits is a military secret and cannot be disclosed. When I departed from Hankou this morning (i.e., yesterday morning), the weather was bad, and I was running around by air and land, so I felt very tired. After speaking, the reporter left the cabin.</p>
<p>Fan Qiwu and Others Travel Together: According to those close to Jiang and Cai, the reorganization of Fujian Province has been largely discussed and a considerable result has been reached. Mr. Fan Qiwu has agreed to serve as the financial commissioner and will travel with Jiang and Cai. Otherwise, Fan would not have gone. However, all parties still believe that implementing the reorganization is more difficult. It is heard that in addition to Fan, those who followed included Zhuang Weigang, the Superintendent of the Xiamen Customs, Xu Minghong, the Secretary of the 19th Army, Tang Dehuang, Qiu Zhaochen, and Ye Shaoquan, and many others.</p>

<p>Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun Have Not Yet Met</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei's illness has been severe for days, with a high fever, so he has refused to see guests. Yesterday morning, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi and Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo visited Wang at Pushi Road one after another, but neither was able to meet him. Mayor Wu and Chiang Kai-shek's representative Zhang Qun, who were specially sent by the central government to urge Wang to return to Nanjing early, notified Wang's residence the day before yesterday to convey the central government's and Chiang Kai-shek's intentions, but yesterday, according to Wu and Zhang, they had not yet received a reply from Wang's residence, so they had not yet met with President Wang.</p>

<p>Donate Silver to Aid the Volunteer Army Outside the Customs</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reported that the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from the Philippine Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association, which stated that on the 30th of this month, the association remitted 730 taels of silver (1,000 yuan in Chinese currency) through Standard Chartered Bank to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for transfer to your association. In addition to sending a separate letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting it to forward the money, we should also send a letter to your association to check and reply. We will attach the official receipt below. As for the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army's determination to sacrifice themselves in resisting Japan, overseas Chinese admire it very much. In addition to actively publicizing and requesting assistance from overseas Chinese everywhere, our association also vows to be their backing. In addition to the 1,000 yuan remitted above, we will continue to remit funds in the future so as not to fail the Northeastern heroes who are winning glory for the country. We look forward from afar in Nanyang, and words cannot express our feelings. Sincerely, Fu Menghan, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association in Midao, Xili Ren Province, Philippines.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Ordnance Factory and Artillery Factory Cease Operations <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Ordnance Department Sends Personnel to Verify Materials</p>
<p>Merger Committee Holds Third Meeting Today</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Ordnance Factory was ordered to merge with the Jinling Factory, it began to wind up operations. The Ordnance Department specially sent committee members Li Shiqiong and others to Shanghai the day before yesterday to separately verify the materials of the factory in order to relocate them. The artillery factory of the factory was also ordered to stop work the day before yesterday. Factory Director Song Shizhen is scheduled to return to Shanghai today to handle the winding-up. The details are listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>Artillery Factory Ordered to Stop Work: The Shanghai Ordnance Factory has been shut down for six months, but part of the artillery factory was previously extended for six months by the Ordnance Department because it still needed to repair various military supplies sent by the various armies. The required funds were also directly claimed from the department by the factory. The six-month period for this month has expired, so the department ordered the factory to stop work and wind up operations. After receiving the order, the director of the factory, Chen Shihong, in addition to ordering the cessation of work, also went to Beijing yesterday to ask the Ordnance Department for instructions on how to properly resettle the workers after the cessation of work and will return to Shanghai in one or two days.</p>
<p>Committee Members Come to Shanghai to Verify: The Ordnance Department sent committee members Li Shiqiong, Zhou Dianli, and Yang Zijia to Shanghai the day before yesterday to be responsible for handling the remaining materials of the factory and whether they should be transported to Beijing and the disposal methods of scrap copper and iron. After Li and others arrived in Shanghai, they stayed at the Zhenhua Hotel and set up a temporary office in the factory to verify various materials every day. If they are in good condition, they will be transported to Beijing; those that cannot be used will be auctioned off. A small part has now been verified and will be completed soon and returned to Beijing to report back.</p>
<p>Song Returns to Shanghai Today: The factory director, Song Shizhen, previously resigned but was not approved and was ordered by the department to be responsible to the end. Therefore, after Song returned to Shanghai from Qingdao, he still went to the factory to work every day. However, because his wife and others were still in Qingdao to escape the summer heat, Song went to Qingdao again a few days ago to welcome his wife and others back to Shanghai and is scheduled to arrive today to be responsible for the winding-up.</p>
<p>Lin Tongyu Went to Hangzhou Yesterday: Most of the machines of the factory were moved to Hangzhou after the January 28th Incident. The disposal of these machines has also been determined. Yesterday, Lin Tongyu, the chief of the audit section, went to Hangzhou to inspect them as a standard for future relocation.</p>
<p>Meeting to Be Held Today: The merger committee formed by the factory, the Jinling Factory, and the Ordnance Department has held two meetings in Beijing. The location issue has been decided, and a third meeting is scheduled to be held today. Jin Shouyu, the director of the Engineering Office of the committee, also went to Beijing yesterday to participate. Whether to build a factory building will be decided at today's meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e43">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>To Revise the Responsible Transportation Regulations</p>
<p>To Express the Hardships on Behalf of Merchants</p>
<p>Hoping That the Government Will Accept Public Opinion</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Railways, Nanjing:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways: Regarding the issue of responsible transportation by the railways, the association previously cabled the Ministry, based on the opinions of the transportation industry, regarding the various obstacles in the regulations, requesting permission to invite the business community to openly discuss them. The request was not approved. Subsequently, the Business Department transferred 300 copies of these regulations to the association, which were distributed to various industries for detailed study. At the same time, the Ministry separately explained them, but the doubts of various industries were not dispelled. They all said that the regulations were contrary to the purpose of convenience and savings. The facts are all there, and they cannot be refuted by empty words. The grain and bean industries are particularly contentious. Recently, they have been actively preparing to switch to water transport in the hope of reducing their burden, which shows that the Ministry's view that the transportation industry alone holds dissenting opinions on the responsible transportation case is inaccurate. The association has a responsibility to express the hardships of merchants on their behalf and also has the ambition to maintain the development of road transport. We deeply hope that the Ministry can accommodate public opinion so that this case can be resolved fairly, so that the national economy and people's livelihood can benefit. Therefore, the various articles that the business community requires to be revised are recorded on a separate sheet and presented by cable. We request that the Ministry examine and approve them for implementation as a matter of public convenience. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Ministry of Railways Encloses Villages <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Villagers Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Requesting Ways to Avoid the Enclosure</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that the Ministry of Railways is building a joint transport terminal west of Zhongshan Road in Zhabei, to the Zhenru area. It has sent personnel to measure and survey the base and will soon jointly determine the boundaries with the municipal government to enclose the land for use. It is found that the land enclosed this time is over three or four thousand acres, and the villages enclosed are also over thirty. However, the villagers in the area north of Jiaotong Road, including Wujiajing, Zhangjiazha, and Wangjiazha, believe that their villages can be avoided based on the geographical situation. They specially sent representative Hou Xuanqing to the municipal government to petition Mayor Wu, requesting ways to provide relief and allow them to be avoided. Lin Yannan, the director of the general affairs section, met with them on his behalf. The representative explained in detail the suffering of the farmers after the villages were enclosed, requesting the government authorities to understand the suffering of the people and approve ways to avoid the enclosure. Lin replied that the municipal government would try its best to accommodate the opinions of the people within the possible scope and would refer it to the Ministry of Railways for review and approval. The representative was satisfied and left. The copy of the document presented to the municipal government is copied below:</p>
<p>Petition for the villages enclosed by the Ministry of Railways to build a joint transport terminal, requesting relief and requesting the Ministry of Railways to approve the avoidance of the enclosure to alleviate the people's livelihood and stabilize the community.</p>
<p>It is noted that the Ministry of Railways' enclosing of land to build a joint transport terminal for the two railways west of Zhongshan Road in the Zhenru Pengpu area is originally intended to revitalize Shanghai and facilitate the national transport, and the people dare not oppose it. However, judging from the recent measurements and boundary determinations by the Ministry of Railways, more than thirty villages have been enclosed, especially in the area north of Jiaotong Road, including Wangjiajing, Zhangjiazha, Zhuxiang, Zhujiazha, Zhangxiang, Wangjiazha, and other villages, which are beyond expectations. Upon hearing this, the people felt like a bolt from the blue and were extremely frightened, all believing that their livelihoods would be cut off from now on. Unable to do otherwise, they appealed for relief, hoping for understanding. Clothing, food, and housing are the three major elements of human life. The people have lived in this area for generations and have been engaged in farming as a profession. Their livelihoods depend entirely on the maintenance of agricultural production. Now that the farmland has been bought, the means of production have been lost, and the village houses that provide shelter from the cold have been enclosed, making it impossible for the people to live and work in peace and maintain their lives after the disaster. The people mostly belong to poor families and have been engaged in farming all their lives. They are indeed unable to work or do business halfway. Now that they cannot farm and cannot live, it is tantamount to putting the people to death. Once forced to take a different path and take risks, it will have a profound and significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. This is the first reason why relief and avoidance of the enclosure should be requested. Although the Ministry of Railways pays for the land bought from the people and provides relocation expenses for the enclosed villages, the price of land nearby will inevitably skyrocket due to convenient transportation, so the land price paid will not be able to buy the same land again, and the relocation expenses provided will not be able to cover the cost of rebuilding. The hard work of farmers over the years is only enough to make a living, and there are no savings to be used for relocation. Moreover, villages have a close relationship with farming. Farmers live here and cultivate and eat here. If there is any remaining land enclosed, it will be difficult to relocate to other places far away, abandoning their careers. Moreover, rural houses have geographical habits and cannot be built anywhere like in cities. Therefore, since they cannot live nearby and cannot relocate far away, how can they imagine the miserable life in the future? This is the second reason why relief and avoidance of the enclosure should be requested. The base enclosed by the Ministry of Railways covers an area of 3,000 to 4,000 acres, while the land enclosed north of Jiaotong Road, from Jiazhazhai, sloping eastward to Zhongshan Road, covers only 100 acres, but more than ten villages are affected, and more than 300 farmers are affected, with production losses of more than one million yuan per year, which has a significant impact on the folk economy. The enclosed villages are all along Jiaotong Road, and the price of land per acre is mostly several thousand yuan, which is several times higher than the price of land south of the road. It is not cost-effective for the Ministry of Railways to buy it. Moreover, Jiaotong Road was originally the main road between Zhabei, Zhenru, and Nanxiang, but now it is also enclosed, and the road line will inevitably be changed in the future, incurring heavy economic and procedural costs. If it is expanded beyond the existing enclosed base south of the road, there will be fewer villages and lower land prices, and it will be close to the existing Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. It will also not hinder the original Jiaotong Road. It is beneficial in both reason and principle. This is the third reason why relief and avoidance of the enclosure should be requested. The construction of the joint station by the Ministry of Railways is inevitable, but we hope that it can understand the suffering of the people and provide relief. We respectfully submit this document and request your excellency to examine it, provide relief, and quickly forward it to the Ministry of Railways, requesting it to avoid the villages north of Jiaotong Road to alleviate the people's livelihood and stabilize the community. It is truly virtuous and convenient. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Annual Meeting of the Chinese Statistical Society <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Second Day's Record</p>
<p>The Chinese Statistical Society continued its second general meeting yesterday morning at the ninth floor hall of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Attendees included members Zhu Junyi, Liu Dajun, Sun Zheng, Yang Runyu, Mao Qihe, Sheng Jun, Jin Guobao, Chen Huayin, Li Quanshi, Tang Qixian, Sun Chaohuan, Lu Zongwei, Zeng Zhaocheng, Chen Zhongqi, Liu Tiesun, Chen Susun, and over thirty others. The meeting commenced at 9:00 AM, chaired by Zhu Junyi. They discussed Chinese statistical terms to unify translations. Each term from the first, second, and third meeting resolutions of the Statistical Terminology Discussion Committee was scrutinized. A total of 133 statistical terms were approved, with one retained. The meeting was then adjourned. After the adjournment, a joint banquet was held by the Pacific International Academic Society, the Chinese Economic Society Research Committee, and the Shanghai YMCA. Chen Liting, a representative of the YMCA and the Pacific International Academic Society, delivered a welcome speech, expressing the hope that various academic groups would cooperate and work together. He Dequi, a representative of the Chinese Economic Society Research Committee, also delivered a welcome speech. Next, Li Quanshi, a representative of the Statistical Society, gave a reply. The banquet concluded. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the entire group departed from the YMCA and visited the Customs Library on Xinzha Road. The curator, Ruan Shourong, and the administrator, Chen Shuxun, showed the guests around the library which housed over 10,000 books. The collection focused on Chinese issues and economics. The Customs publications were particularly complete. All issues of the "Bank Weekly," a full set of the "North-China Daily News," and the complete "Weekly Review" were among the rare books. On average, five to six people visited the library daily. The library was established last year, and this year's book acquisition budget was 30,000 taels. The Customs Compilation Office was located on the second floor. It housed the statistics department, specializing in statistical work, equipped with complete statistical machinery valued at over US$200,000. The staff consisted of 41 people, working seven hours a day from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The salaries ranged from 20 to 60 yuan per month. Most of the female staff had a secondary school education. Creating a report required three steps. The department head was an American, MEGWINE, and the deputy head was HOBSTOCK. After the visit, the group proceeded to the Public Utilities Bureau in Fenglin Bridge. Director Huang Boqiao gave a welcoming speech expressing his apologies, and the group was divided into four groups to tour the various departments. The entire group of over 30 members toured the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. At 5:30 PM, they attended a reception hosted by the municipal government. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and Public Utilities Bureau Director Huang Boqiao were present. Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying, "It is a great honor for me to meet with all of you experts today. Since its establishment, the municipal government has not been able to carry out construction to its full potential for the past five years due to various reasons. There are two reasons for this: (1) the concentration of the economy in the concessions, and (2) the impact of the current situation. Because the economy is concentrated in the concessions, the finances are very difficult. At the same time, the Nanshi and Zhabei districts are reluctant to increase the burden on citizens. Therefore, the municipal government can only spend within its means and cannot spend beyond its means. Therefore, the municipal government has made little progress in construction. I hope that all of you present will provide guidance." Next, Liu Dajun, the president of the Statistical Society, gave a reply, saying, "Among all the cities in the country, Shanghai is number one. The labor dispute statistics of the Social Affairs Bureau are valuable. Last year, I was sent by the National Government to Europe for inspection. Germany and Italy were the best. I have served in the Legislative Yuan and the National Government for four years, and I feel that statistics are very important. Today, on behalf of our society, I would like to express my gratitude to the municipal government and various bureaus." Next, Wu Dajun, the director of the Central Bureau of Statistics, gave a speech, saying, "The government fully encourages the study of statistics. There is a need for cooperation between the government and research groups. Research groups must base their work on the registration and administrative statistical materials produced by the government, to be truthful and accurate. The government must also use the most economical and effective methods to obtain statistical reference materials from research groups. Higher-level governments are too hasty in urging lower-level governments to submit statistical materials, forcing them to falsify reports. To break through this difficulty: (1) can the amount of statistical material needed by governments at all levels be reduced to the minimum? (2) the accuracy of statistical reports from governments at all levels must be guaranteed; (3) the statistical materials produced must have practical applications." He also briefly described the four characteristics of the new central statistical system. The Central Political Conference has already passed the principles of the Statistics Law, and the Legislative Yuan will pass it soon. The above difficulties can all be broken through. Last night at 7:00 PM, the society held a reception on the second floor of the China Society to answer questions from various sectors and to host out-of-town members. Dozens of guests from various sectors and representatives from various organizations attended, along with over 30 members. At the dinner, Mr. Liu Dajun distributed his books "The Statistical Undertaking in China," "English Chinese Population Statistics," "A Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Financial Resources," his edited "China Review Weekly," the English "What Will Happen After the War Against Japan," and the Statistical Daily "Special Issue on International Conferences." President Liu Dajun gave a speech, followed by speeches from the guests, all hoping that the society would work hard on statistical undertakings and serve as the general statistical research organization for the entire country. Finally, the Guangyi Photo Studio took a group photo and the meeting adjourned and concluded.</p>

<p>Proposals to be submitted to the Municipal Authorities regarding Water Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association held its twentieth general meeting at 4 PM yesterday. Representatives from various institutions including the Xingye Bank, the Continental Bank, the Donglai Bank, the Central Trust Company, Liu Jingdetang, Zhou Gengji Jingji Company, Huada Foreign Company, Jin Xing Company, Longzhang Company Jingji Company, Yongqing Company, Jiuxing Company, Changtai Company, and others, including Kui Yanfang, Shen Jixuan, Ye Shantao, Wang Zihou, Yu Shian, Yuan Yiqing, Dou Yaoting, Chen Zhongci, Li Bohan, Jiang Bingsheng, and over eighty others were present. Kui Yanfang was elected chairman and Tao Leqin was the recorder. First, the chairman reported on correspondence with the Public Works Department. Next, Li Bohan reported on the issue of increased water prices. The association had organized a special committee to discuss the matter, which decided to adopt both proactive and passive measures to deal with it. The association was preparing to create a "Memorandum on the Drastic Increase in Water Fees," which would list examples of the current water fees calculated using the old percentage (75%) of rent method and the new meter reading method, as well as the increase in multiples, in order to be simple and clear. It would be sent to the Public Works Department and the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Public Utilities Committee, requesting them to find ways to provide relief. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The memorandum was revised and approved. (2) A resolution to send letters to all members urging them to dig wells as a passive measure was passed. (3) To make suggestions to the municipal authorities and the public regarding construction: (A) Maintain the calculation of water fees based on rent as the standard (because the additional cost has been added to the water company's expenses). (B) If water fees must be calculated using meters, then (a) the burden on poor people must not be increased; (b) the water company should install water meters in every household, estimate the cost of water supply through testing, and then calculate water fees using meters uniformly, setting three or two levels of water prices according to the level of rent. However, the water fees should be paid directly by the users. The resolution was passed. (4) A resolution to discuss using vernacular Chinese to print a declaration to be sent to all landlords, stamped with the accounting office's seal, and posted in various alleys was passed. The meeting adjourned at around 7 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Investigation of Inferior Goods <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Hu Futin Assaulted</p>
<p>Turmoil in the Handkerchief Industry</p>
<p>Wang Ruizhang Sued</p>
<p>Wang Ruizhang, the owner of the Xintongfeng Factory in Donggonghe Lane, Simalu (Fourth Road), has been in conflict with Hu Futin, an investigator from the Shanghai Handkerchief Industry Association. Both parties have filed lawsuits in the First District Court. The following is a record of the cause: According to a complaint from a member of the handkerchief industry, after the economic severance with Japan began, on June 7, factories such as Jianxin, Jingxin, and San Yi convened a meeting of the industry. It was resolved unanimously not to buy or sell inferior goods, and violators would be severely punished. All members signed in agreement. More than ten days later, it was discovered that the member Xintongfeng Factory was privately importing inferior goods. An emergency meeting of all members was convened to discuss how to handle the situation. Wang Ruizhang attended the meeting and stated that it was an accidental import and that such behavior would not happen again. However, according to a member's report on August 22, the factory was still importing inferior goods. To be cautious, Hongfu Factory's Hu Futin was specially assigned to investigate the truth. Unexpectedly, Wang Ruizhang not only refused the investigation but even dared to assault and humiliate him, causing Hu to suffer serious injuries, and declared, "My business is my own affair. Who dares to make things difficult for me?" Hu reported the injury to the association, which convened a meeting and decided to expel the factory from membership. Wang Ruizhang also hired a lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper, stating that the inferior goods stored by the industry before July numbered more than 10,000. His factory only had a small number and had already registered them on file. He had never imported inferior goods since then. He also stated that Hu Futin approached him on August 19 to sell 130 dozen towel handkerchiefs from Hongfu Factory. He agreed to buy 100 dozen, but not the remaining 30 dozen. On the third day, August 22, Hu went to collect the price of the 30 dozen, and a conflict arose during the conversation. On August 24, Hu and Mr. Miao went to the factory, and the money for the 30 dozen was paid in full. The Handkerchief Industry Association was indignant upon reading this and commissioned lawyer Wu Guochang to represent them in a rebuttal, stating that the report to the association about Wang Ruizhang continuing to import inferior goods was not made by Hu Futin. Hu was injured at the factory because he was commissioned by the association to investigate whether he was continuing to import inferior goods. Now, he is fabricating claims in an attempt to deceive the public. Wang Ruizhang also replied, saying that they were protecting Hu Futin, obliterating the facts, not investigating the cause of the quarrel, seeking revenge, and falsely accusing him out of spite. In addition to publishing the details in flyers, the association has also commissioned lawyer Wu Guochang to file a lawsuit against Wang Ruizhang in the First District Court. The lawsuit is as follows: "For refusing to investigate inferior goods and causing injury through assault, please investigate and severely punish according to the law to appease public opinion and deter evil deeds. The plaintiff has been in the handkerchief business for many years. My industry, hating the brutality of the violent sun (Japan), in order to pursue economic severance to bring about its demise, established an association and resolved to vow not to buy or sell inferior goods, violators will be punished, After each member voluntarily signs, unexpectedly after more than ten days, it was found that the defendant violated the rules and privately imported inferior goods. The association convened all the members to discuss the handling method. At that time, the defendant came to the meeting and pleaded that it was a mistake and asked for forgiveness, and that he would never commit the crime again in the future, otherwise he would be willing to accept the most severe punishment. He also made a letter of intent to show that he had no other intentions. Unexpectedly, the defendant lost his conscience, risked being irresponsible, according to the report of the members on August 22, the defendant still imported inferior goods. In order to be cautious, the association specially assigned the plaintiff to go on the morning of the 24th of this month At about 12 o'clock, go to investigate the truth. Unexpectedly, the defendant not only refused to investigate, but also committed a violent assault, causing serious injuries to the plaintiff's chest, which was diagnosed by Nanyang Hospital and a certificate was issued. The defendant's actions constituted a crime under Article 293 of the Criminal Law, and he filed a lawsuit in accordance with the provisions of Article 337 of the Criminal Procedure Law. After receiving the complaint, the court issued a summons, scheduling a hearing for both parties at 11 AM on the 22nd of this month.</p>

<p>Li Ruiling Kidnapped</p>
<p>Abducted on the Thirteenth Night in Tanggu</p>
<p>Shanghai Residence Receives an Anonymous Telegram</p>
<p>Li Ruiling, the comprador of the Jardine Matheson's Northern Shipping Line vessel "Dingsheng", went to Tianjin on the ship this time. The "Dingsheng" could not enter the Baihe River because of the shallow water when it arrived in Tanggu, so it stopped in Tanggu to load and unload goods. It left Tanggu on the 15th to return to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Li Ruiling was suddenly kidnapped by bandits in Tanggu on the night of the 13th. It was also heard that two clerks from Jardine Matheson's Tanggu branch were also missing. After Li Ruiling was kidnapped, his wife in Shanghai suddenly received a telegram yesterday morning. It was sent from Tianjin and reported that Li Ruiling had been kidnapped. The end of the telegram was not signed, which was very strange. Li's wife did not believe it at first, but at noon, Jardine Matheson also received an official telegram from Tanggu stating that Li Ruiling had indeed been kidnapped and his whereabouts were unknown. Yesterday, the Shanghai office wired its Tianjin branch, reporting to the military and police authorities to investigate Li's whereabouts and notifying his family. The "Dingsheng" can leave Shanghai today to go south. Li Ruiling has no family property, and his monthly income is only enough to make ends meet. The reason for the kidnapping is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Korean Ticket Collectors <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Dispute over Severance Pay</p>
<p>Under the Great Clamor of the Crowd</p>
<p>A Large Number of Detectives Came to Suppress</p>
<p>After Using Force, All Were Detained</p>
<p>Transferred to the Japanese Consulate for Handling</p>
<p>Yesterday at 4:30 PM, thirty-one dismissed Korean ticket collectors from the Public Car Company of the Public Concession on Kang'nuo Road (Connaught Road) had a dispute with the company over the collection of severance pay. When the public car ticket sellers and ticket collectors requested a raise from the company and were unsuccessful, they went on strike. The company temporarily ordered thirty-one Korean ticket collectors to act as ticket sellers. But as the ticket collectors did not agree, the company recognized that these ticket collectors were disobedient, hindering business, and they dismissed the thirty-one Korean ticket collectors. The ticket collectors then requested the company in a joint letter to issue two years' salary as severance pay so that they could return to their home country. It is said that the company agreed to issue 150 yuan per person and agreed to issue it yesterday. Therefore, the ticket collectors gathered at the company yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock to receive it. As there was no result, they turned to the company manager to negotiate, also without result. The crowd then made a great clamor. The company was afraid of causing trouble, so it quickly reported to the Gordon Road police station. A large number of detectives were sent to the scene to suppress them. Unexpectedly, the ticket collectors prevented the detectives from entering and used force. The detectives then arrested all the ticket collectors and transferred them to the police station by truck and sent them to the Japanese Consulate for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Dispute over the Accounts of Public Property between Uncle and Nephew <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yucheng Accused</p>
<p>Xu Hands Over Two Kinds of Account Books</p>
<p>One is a Complete Copy</p>
<p>Xu Yucheng, a shareholder of Hengtong Qianzhuang (Money Exchange), was accused of embezzlement by his nephews Xu Wenrong, Wenxin, Yan E'sen, Zhong Hongsheng, and others in the First Special District Court due to a dispute over public property accounts. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zhen opened the court to interrogate. First, the plaintiff and defendant were asked about their age and address, and then the plaintiff Xu Wenrong's complaint was questioned. According to his statement, the defendant was his uncle. After our family divided the property in the 31st year of Guangxu (1905), a copy of the public property was submitted. It was estimated to be worth more than 80,000 yuan and was managed by the defendant. Until now, the defendant has never handed over the account books, so now we have no way of knowing the exact amount of public funds. However, if the account books are investigated, there must be evidence to prove the discrepancies. However, because the defendant is an uncle, we nephews dare not say that he has embezzled. We have recently learned that the defendant has submitted the account books to the court, and I have requested to copy them. I must wait until after verification before I can know the exact amount. During the defendant's management period, although he entrusted his third uncle to manage the account because he was going to Beijing, after the third uncle died, the defendant took over again. If the third uncle had any deficits during his management, the defendant did not declare them when he took over, which shows that the third uncle had no deficits. Next, according to the defendant Xu Yucheng's statement, I managed the public account from the time the family was divided in the 31st year of Guangxu (1905) until the autumn of the 32nd year (1906). Because I had to go to Beijing, I handed it over to my younger brother Shiheng to manage. Shiheng managed it for a total of four years and two months. Because he died of illness, I took over again. However, after Shiheng died, the account was settled, and more than 1,000 yuan was used up. Now I am accused by my two nephews, which is really inexplicable. My income and expenses are all clear, but three account books were taken away by the plaintiff long ago, and the rest are all there. The defendant's lawyers Yang Linzhi and Ye Shaoying immediately stated that the defendant has brought all the receipts and payments for all these years to the case, and the account books have also been submitted to the court. However, there are two types of account books: one is the original account of funeral expenses, and the other is a copy. The copied account is purely transcribed based on various receipts. Please verify. If there is any fraud, I am willing to accept the punishment. He also submitted several packets of account bills. The plaintiff's lawyer E'sen then requested the court to note that the defendant had admitted that the account books submitted by the defendant were copies. He then recounted the situation where he requested the defendant to hand over the accounts in the civil court. The two defendant's lawyers also presented the accountant's audit report along with their pleadings. After Judge Wu examined and verified them, he found that further investigation was needed and ordered the hearing to be adjourned to another date.</p>

<p>Experience of Collecting Exhibits in Hangzhou for the Exposition</p>
<p>Cai Wuji, director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, noted that Dr. Arber, an American, had emphasized the art and handicrafts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in his speech in Shanghai last time. He went to Hangzhou with Xu Baohua last Wednesday to discuss the issue of products from Zhejiang province. They repeatedly negotiated with Hangzhou Mayor Zhao Zhiyou, Chamber of Commerce President Wang Zhuzhai, and relevant personnel in the Zhejiang Construction Department. Mayor Zhao convened representatives from various industries in Hangzhou twice and held meetings in the auditorium of the municipal government. Cai Wuji and Xu Baohua successively reported on the participation process and the situation of collecting exhibits. Finally, it was decided to organize a committee in Hangzhou to collect exhibits on behalf of the Shanghai organizers. Wu Gang, the head of the Social Affairs Section of the Hangzhou Municipal Government, was responsible for convening the committee. In both meetings, the Chamber of Commerce and representatives from various industries were able to openly and honestly raise difficult questions for discussion, and Cai and Xu explained them one by one. As a result, it was extremely successful. As for the products from other counties in Zhejiang province, coordination with the Construction Department had been completed. The agricultural products will be handled by Section Chief Zhang of the Construction Department, the industrial products will be handled by Section Chief Wu, and the construction projects will be handled separately by Section Chief Zhu of the Zhejiang Highway Bureau, Director Chen of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau, and Director Du. All types of products from Hangzhou and Zhejiang province are allowed to be sent to Shanghai by the end of this year. Cai Wuji and Xu Baohua, seeing that their official business was completed, left Hangzhou by special train last night and returned to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Society recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways with many misunderstandings and replied to the Ministry by letter yesterday. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"To whom it may concern: We have received your Ministry's telegram stating that it is responsible for transportation and has no relationship with the Jiangsu Province Opium Public Sales. This measure is to relieve the pain of transportation for merchants and promote the prosperity of the railway industry. Our Society expresses its sympathy and trusts it very much. As for the questions asked by our Society, we will reply to them separately as follows: (1) In recent years, railway police have cracked many cases of transporting soil by train, and your Ministry's announcement of the regulations for responsible transportation coincided with the Jiangsu Province's implementation of opium public sales on the same day, September 1, which is easy to cause misunderstandings (2) Many cases of private transportation of opium in Jiangsu Province are transported by railway. Our Society has reports available for consultation at any time (3) Our Society's request to the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate the truth is different from directly requesting punishment. Even from the perspective of the two phrases 'where there's smoke, there's fire, it's not without reason,' it is also suspected based on previous cases of railway transportation of soil. In short, our Society thoroughly opposes public sales and has no ill will towards your Ministry (4) Our Executive Director Mr. Han's reply to the reporter of the Dalu Newspaper, the phrase 'I don't know how the truth is' does not have the meaning of determining whether it is true or not, and cannot be hastily regarded as our Society admitting that this news is true or not (5) The Jiangsu Opium Public Sales has been rumored for a long time, newspapers have reported it, and people have been talking about it. Our Society's request to the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate and impeach it is largely based on newspapers. It is incomprehensible that only your Ministry has not heard of it (6) According to the telegram, responsible transportation has nothing to do with public sales, but the matter of soil traffickers transporting opium by train may not be completely eliminated. I dare to ask your Ministry to strictly order the inspectors and railway police on each route to carefully verify. If there is any concealment found, please send the person and the stolen goods to the court for punishment in accordance with the law in order to maintain the opium ban (7) Our Society's purpose is pure, does not ask about politics, does not participate in party disputes, and strives for the struggle against drugs entirely from the position of the people. Our Society's fair attitude has been the same for eight years. The telegram said to satisfy the selfishness of one or two people. I don't know what it refers to. Our Society has enemies and grudges in the fight against public sales, but the action of resisting public sales is really to please the hearts of the people and to disregard the wishes of one or two people. The above answers are all from the bottom of our Society's heart, and I dare to believe that it will be sympathized with by your Ministry. In response, I hope you will take note of it, and I will be very grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e57">Seaport Quarantine Office Cholera Weekly Report <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Sixteenth Issue</p>
<p>Wu Lien-teh, Director of the Seaport Quarantine Office and concurrently Director of the Shanghai Provisional Cholera Prevention Office, issued the sixteenth cholera report yesterday (the 14th) as follows: (1) During the past weekend (September 10th), only 110 cases of cholera were discovered in the city (with 10 deaths). This is a decrease from the 131 cases (with 11 deaths) of the previous week. This indicates that the cholera epidemic in Shanghai is showing a clear trend towards becoming milder. The regions and number of cases discovered last week are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Region　Number of Cases　　Number of Deaths</p>
<p>Shanghai City　40　　0</p>
<p>International Settlement　28 (including 2 foreigners)　　4</p>
<p>French Concession　41　　5</p>
<p>Unknown　1　　1</p>
<p>Total Last Week 110 (including 2 foreigners)　　10</p>
<p>Total Previously 4103 (including 7 foreigners)　　301 (including 19 foreigners)</p>
<p>Grand Total 4213 (including 73 foreigners)　　311 (same as above)</p>
<p>(2) It was observed that several weeks ago, the cholera outbreak in the French Concession was more rampant than in other areas, due to the presence of over 12,000 Russian residents, many of whom were refugees. Fortunately, the health authorities of the French Concession administered cholera prevention injections to all residents, regardless of age, so the Russian community did not suffer significant epidemic harm. (3) The weather this week was cool with frequent rain. The highest temperature recorded on September 10th was 88.3 degrees Fahrenheit, the lowest on September 4th was 62.2 degrees Fahrenheit, with an average of 74.0 degrees. Humidity ranged from 55 to 97 degrees, with an average of 80.1 degrees. (4) The cholera epidemic situation in other ports also showed a decrease. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Cases　　　Number of Deaths</p>
<p>Nanjing (Weekend report of September 10th)　48　7</p>
<p>Hankou (Weekend report of September 3rd)　56　6</p>
<p>Xiamen　Same as above　52　13</p>
<p>Guangzhou　Same as above　3　　0</p>
<p>Tianjin　Same as above　　0　0</p>
<p>(5) Considering that the cholera epidemic situation in the seaports of Tianjin Tanggu, Yantai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou has become very mild, the Quarantine Office has decided to announce the removal of the designation of these ports as epidemic ports, starting from September 16th. Therefore, ships arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin Tanggu, Yantai, and Guangzhou will no longer need to display quarantine flags upon arrival and can be exempted from quarantine. However, this does not apply to cases where infectious diseases or deaths are discovered on board. As for ships coming directly from Hong Kong to Shanghai, they will still be subject to routine quarantine. Ships coming from Hong Kong via Shantou and Xiamen to Shanghai will still be subject to passenger list quarantine procedures. (6) Regarding the two cities closest to Shanghai with the most convenient transportation, such as Hangzhou and Ningbo, no epidemic reports from those areas had been received. Fortunately, a report was received from Dr. Ding Licheng of the Ningbo Hua Mei Hospital, stating that the first case of cholera in the city was a female discovered on July 9th. Since then, the epidemic has gradually spread, reaching over 4,000 cases, with over 500 deaths. During the outbreak, eight temporary epidemic hospitals were dedicated to prevention and control, but not all patients were hospitalized. The Ningbo Red Cross Hospital and Jiangdong Hospital treated 2,127 cholera patients, of whom 156 died. Ningbo has no running water supply, and residents can only drink well and river water. (7) On September 5th, a sailboat arrived in Shanghai from Huzhou with five crew members. Two of them had cholera. The boat owner, surnamed Song, 52 years old, contracted cholera at 4:00 AM on September 5th and died at 3:00 PM the same day, a total of only 11 hours from illness to death. His youngest son, 16 years old, also fell ill on the same day and died the next morning. The other three were fortunate enough to be unharmed. Upon arrival in Shanghai, they were given cholera prevention injections by this office. This is specially recorded for your attention. (8) Recent investigations show that the beds in the epidemic hospitals are mostly empty. For example, the Xizang Road epidemic hospital, which usually accommodates 60 to 70 patients, now averages only 5 to 6 patients. It is expected that the hospital can be closed by the end of the month. Other epidemic hospitals, such as the Hongkou epidemic hospital on Tangshan Road and the epidemic hospitals attached to the Chinese Red Cross Society, will be closed on September 15th. Only the Isolation Hospital of the Shanghai Municipal Council will continue to operate.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Xiang Sheng Tannery <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Workers Stage a Full Strike Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Objecting to the Factory's Dismissal of a Large Number of Workers</p>
<p>Resumed Work in the Afternoon After Persuasion from the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The New Voice Agency reports that the Xiang Sheng Tannery on Pingliang Road, Eastern Shanghai, has been in operation for over 20 years and its business has been thriving. However, it suddenly announced the dismissal of a large number of workers in the newspaper the day before yesterday, without prior notice. Upon hearing this news, all the workers were extremely indignant and went on strike yesterday morning. The union reported the matter to the Party and government authorities, requesting mediation. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Document Presented to the Party and Government Authorities: The Tannery Workers' Union presented a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating, "Regarding the Xiang Sheng Tannery's unwarranted dismissal of a large number of workers, we request that personnel be dispatched to legally prevent this in order to maintain people's livelihood. It has come to our attention that the workers of the Xiang Sheng factory reported to the union that they have been working in the factory and have always been law-abiding. The workers could no longer bear the factory's oppression and had to legally join the union to seek job security. Because all the workers joined the union, the factory could not implement its oppressive measures and became even more intensified, suddenly dismissing as many as 18 workers and publishing in various newspapers that the factory used to make white leather but now makes red leather and recruits new workers, etc., in order to deceive the outside world. However, it is not known that the manufacturing of red leather requires the work of gray leather room (originally green leather) workers to peel and manufacture. The factory published in various newspapers that it would switch to making red leather, and the gray leather room workers would have no work to do. This is truly a cover-up, deceiving the outside world and not understanding the language of the leather industry. Now, the factory workers are oppressed by the bourgeoisie, using the poisonous language of deceiving the outside world as a reason to suddenly dismiss as many as 18 workers. The entire factory's workers are extremely indignant and have gone on strike. In addition to the union ordering the workers to strictly maintain order and await a resolution quietly, we hereby request that your (union) bureau promptly dispatch personnel to stop this, so as to facilitate the workers' movement and maintain people's livelihood. We await your orders with utmost urgency and respect."</p>
<p>The Party Headquarters Dispatches Personnel to Mediate: After receiving the union's report, Wang Manyun, Director of the People's Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, dispatched cadre Fan Guoren, along with representatives from the union, to rush to the factory at 11:00 AM yesterday to mediate. However, due to the factory's tough attitude, mediation could not proceed. At the same time, the dismissed workers were advised to return to work as usual, and the striking workers were advised to resume work first and await the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate according to the law. Thereupon, all the workers accepted the advice and returned to the factory to resume work in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Tonghua Steamer Dispatches Chief Mariner to Rescue <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Tunan's Rescue Proves Ineffective, Ordered to Sail to Hankou</p>
<p>Jiang Xin Now Dispatched to Find a Way</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Bureau's Jianghua steamer ran aground in Qizhou, the hull was fortunately undamaged. The Tunan steamer, which was dispatched to rescue it, was ordered to go to Hankou to perform duties, leaving it still in danger. The General Bureau decided to send the Jiangxin steamer's chief mariner to rescue it again. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxin Dispatched Again: Li Guojie, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, received a wireless report yesterday morning signed by Xu Haisheng, Captain of the Tonghua steamer, and Huang Hongqian, Captain of the Tunan steamer, stating, "Tunan's rescue is ineffective. Please dispatch another capable vessel. The tide is gradually receding. Tunan is ordered to go to Hankou to perform duties." He immediately wired the Hankou branch to have the Jiangxin steamer rush to join the Liji steamer in the rescue after its arrival. It is reported that Jiangxin is not equipped with wireless, and it will have to arrive in Hankou today, wait for passengers and cargo to be unloaded, and then rush to the rescue. The date of departure from Hankou is expected to be the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Finding a Way to Get Out of Danger: McKenna, Chief Mariner of the China Merchants Bureau, an Englishman, is experienced in navigation. He was ordered by the General Manager to travel to Beijing on the Jianghua steamer the day before yesterday, then transfer to Qizhou to find a way to tow the Tonghua steamer out of danger. He brought various towing and lightering equipment. It is expected to arrive the day after tomorrow. At that time, the Liji and Jiangxin steamers will work together to tow and rescue it, and a way to get out of danger will definitely be found.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Wusong Baoming Electric Company <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Merged with Zhabei Water and Electricity Company</p>
<p>Wusong's Electricity Business Can Be Restored Soon</p>
<p>Water Supply Project is Large and Difficult to Implement in the Short Term</p>
<p>Among the electrical companies in this city operated by Chinese businessmen, there were originally six: 1. Zhenru, 2. Baoming, 3. Xianghua, 4. Pudong, 5. Zhabei, and 6. China Merchants. Only the China Merchants and Zhabei companies had generators. Although Baoming also had generators, its power was very weak. As for Zhenru and Xianghua, they used electricity from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and Pudong used electricity from the China Merchants Electric Company. After the war, the Wusong Baoming Electric Company suffered heavy losses, resulting in a declaration of closure. As a result, residents in the Wusong area felt greatly inconvenienced and applied to the city authorities to find a way to restore it quickly. However, the Baoming Company, with huge losses, was unable to continue operations, so it was merged into the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities convened shareholders of both companies to discuss the merger. The principle has now been decided. Roughly, Baoming's stocks will be converted into Zhabei's stocks at a discount. Various details are still being carefully discussed. However, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, believes that the electricity in Wusong needs to be restored urgently, so he ordered the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to start various projects immediately. The company's generator is originally located on Jungong Road, which is very close to Wusong. The construction project is very convenient. It is said that it can be completed soon. As for the Wusong water supply problem, it was originally intended that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company would install pipes at the same time, but because the project is large, it is difficult to implement in the short term.</p>

<p>Bureau of Public Utilities Determined to Restore</p>
<p>Currently Investigating the Reasons for Losses</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus Company in this city was forced to close down due to excessive losses. Public utilities, according to national laws and regulations, cannot be arbitrarily suspended. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Xu Yuanfang, secretary of the Bureau of Public Utilities, regarding this matter yesterday. According to him, it is true that the Shanghai South Public Bus Company could not continue to operate due to excessive losses. However, the company is still considering raising funds again to restore operations. If this cannot be realized, the Bureau of Public Utilities will find another way to handle it. In short, the Bureau of Public Utilities will not allow the traffic on the original routes to be suspended for long. As for the restoration method, if the city government has funds, it can be taken over by the city. Otherwise, it can be contracted out to merchants again. Currently, Director Huang is studying the reasons why the company is losing money, so that it can be used as a reference for future city-run or merchant-run operations, so as not to repeat the same mistakes.</p>

<p>At 1:00 AM the other night, more than 30 bandits suddenly broke into the home of Tan Ruiqing in Zhaojiadang Township, Fifth District, Shanghai County, intending to rob. They were immediately discovered by the eighth Jia of the nearby Riot Corps, and riot corps soldiers, including Tan Jinxiang, rushed to resist, repelling them on the spot. Tan Jinxiang resumed his courage and pursued them, resulting in being surrounded by the bandits, who fatally wounded him in the head with knives. The township head immediately reported to the district office, and the district chief Xing Zhigang, riot corps assistant Wang Sicheng, and Fifth Public Security Bureau chief Xiao Jianxun led a large number of patrol soldiers and riot corps soldiers to investigate, confirming the facts. District Chief Xing then reported to the local court, and Prosecutor Li was assigned to the township for investigation. He also reported to the Shanghai County Government and the Nanhui County Government, requesting a general order for joint arrest. It is now reported that District Chief Xing, Corps Commander Kong, and others believe that riot corps soldier Tan Jinxiang was loyal and courageous in resisting the bandits and died tragically in the line of duty. They have jointly requested the county government to forward a request to the provincial government for awards and compensation, and intend to organize a memorial service and tribute to console the martyr's soul and inspire encouragement.</p>

<p>Platoon Leader, Russian Teenager, Commits Suicide by Gun</p>
<p>Reasons for Suicide Unknown</p>
<p>Burial Arranged by Friends</p>
<p>Olisak Rexki, a 24-year-old Russian platoon leader in the International Volunteer Corps, shot himself in the head with a rifle in the corps barracks on Fujian Road at approximately 7:00 AM the other morning. His brains were blown out and flesh and blood flew everywhere. Upon hearing the sound, a corps member, Russian Meng Xueli Ditai Ke, arrived and found him lying in a pool of blood. He immediately reported to the Central Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. However, the Russian was already dead. The body was transported to the Philand Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was requested to assign Prosecutor Zhan Liangce, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to the morgue to examine the body. According to Meng Xueli Ditai Ke, 35 years old, Russian, the deceased was a friend. No one saw him when he shot himself. There were four people living in the deceased's room, and three of them had gone to breakfast at the time, so the reason for his suicide is unknown. According to the corps commander, Sibili Chu, 35 years old, Russian, residing at 1881 Xiasi Road, the deceased's family is not in Shanghai, and he is now collecting the body on their behalf. Zhan then ruled that the deceased, Russian Olisak Rexki, male, committed suicide with a rifle. The body was handed over to Sibili Chu, the corps commander of the Russian Merchants Corps, to be taken back for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Ruthless Kidnappers <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Attempt to Extort Money Even After the Hostage Escapes</p>
<p>Wu Tongchao Suffers Unspeakably</p>
<p>One Kidnapper Arrested En Route</p>
<p>Wu Jingyang, a driver from Yimei Electric Company at No. 131, is from Yancheng. He and his wife, Wu Shen, live at No. 3, Fengyu Lane, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei. His father, Wu Tongchao, has some property in his hometown of Yancheng. On March 12 of this year, a large number of bandits in Yancheng suddenly broke into the Wu family armed with weapons and kidnapped Wu Tongchao. At the same time, Tao and Zhou, etc. were also taken away, sending a letter to Wu's family demanding a ransom of $1,500. His son, Wu Jingyang, immediately returned to his hometown and contacted the bandits. Due to ransom issues, an agreement could not be reached. Until April 22, these people committed another crime in Funing County, Jiangbei. The victims reported it, and the authorities dispatched troops to pursue them. As a result, several hostages were rescued on the ship, and Wu Tongchao also escaped at that time, but had already suffered in the bandit's lair for 46 days. Afterwards, the bandits still refused to let Wu go, sending two letters to his son, Wu Jingyang, instructing him to take care of it, otherwise there would be unfavorable consequences. After receiving the letter, Wu ignored it. Until the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Jingyang's wife, Shen, met Wu Hongcheng, a Jiangbei kidnapper in the case, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Cardinal Mercier. She reported it to Chinese Constable No. 2043 and Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei, who arrested Wu Hongcheng and detained him in the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to the police lawyer Wang Yaotang, the incident occurred in Jiangbei and should be transferred to the Jiangbei authorities for trial. However, the victim Wu Tongchao's son, Jingyang, lives in Shanghai, and has recently received two threatening letters from the bandits. Therefore, this case requests an extension for the police to investigate and determine where the incident occurred before deciding whether to accept the case. He is currently asking permission to detain the defendant. Wu Jingyang further stated that since his father was kidnapped, the bandits demanded a ransom of $1,500. I returned to Yancheng to contact the defendant, but a price could not be agreed upon. Later, my father was rescued by the army. He was on a ship hired by the bandits for a total of 40 days and suffered greatly. Afterwards, I received two threatening letters instructing me to take care of it. Because my income is limited, I cannot fulfill the bandits' desires, so I ignored it. The two letters have now been handed over to the police. It was not until yesterday that I met the defendant on the way.</p>

<p>I then called the police and arrested him. It turns out that the defendant, Gao Fajin, and the plaintiff, Gao Xijin, are quite influential in the Jiangbei area, with many apprentices under their control. When Wu Hongcheng was interrogated, he confessed that he knew nothing about the kidnapping case. He had just come to Shanghai yesterday and was arrested. After Judge Ge Sixun reviewed the confession, he ordered that Wu Hongcheng be detained and interrogated again next Monday.</p>

<p>Thief Li Hanzhang Caught with Guns and Bullets</p>
<p>Ruentai Feng Rice Shop on Doushi Street, Nanshi Chinese Area, has been sending out bill collectors to collect debts from all parties due to the approaching lunar Mid-Autumn Festival. Yesterday, the shop's bill collector, Chen Chunlin, went out to collect debts in the morning. At approximately 5:45 PM, he had collected a total of $1,335 in banknotes, $324 in local bank notes, and two checks, one for $758 and one for $358. At that time, he was about to return to the shop when five bandits suddenly jumped out of Zhoushan Road near Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, displaying handguns and blocking his way, robbing Chen of all the money on his person and fleeing in different directions. Chen then pursued closely behind. One of the thieves turned around and fired two shots, fortunately missing. Nearby detectives also gathered upon hearing the sound and surrounded the area. As a result, thief Li Hanzhang was intercepted and a handgun with live ammunition was seized, and he was taken to the police station. After a thorough interrogation by the police chief, he was ordered to be detained and sent to court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Gouging-Out-Eyes Case of the Ding Family <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Dingjiagang, Gaoqiao, Pudong, is a community where the Ding family lives together. Ding Achun does not engage in proper work and often steals clothing from family members, which is resented by the family. In late last month, Ding Achun stole clothing drying on bamboo poles, which was seen by Ding Changyu (also known as Wang Laoguan), who reprimanded him. As a result, they quarreled and fought. Ding Changyu was no match and gathered other family members, including Ding Abing, Ding Longhu, Ding Jintao, Ding Ayuan, Ding Shunsheng, and others, to take revenge on Ding Achun. Because Ding Achun was isolated, he was beaten all over and had his eyes gouged out, resulting in blindness and disability. Ding Achun's wife, Ding Wei, then filed a complaint with the Nanhui County Government, which arrested and detained the murderer Ding Changwang. It was also discovered that Ding Longhu was in the clothing store opened by Ding Bingquan in Gaomiao. Ding Zhu discovered this and immediately reported to the Fifth Police Station of the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Police Chief Yu Ruilin arrested and escorted Ding Longhu to the station. After interrogation by Director Wang Tongzongshan, it was found that the case involved injury and disability and was sentenced to the Third Section for legal processing.</p>

<p>Soliciting National Goods Samples for Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association sent letters to Zhenhua, Tianzhang, Jiangnan, Gongqin, and more than 30 other factories regarding the solicitation of samples for Nanyang Bridge ports, stating: "Dear Sirs, Chen Youzhang, dispatched by the Guangming National Goods Company in Surabaya, Java, has come to Shanghai to investigate national goods and intends to first solicit sample prices and then take them back to Surabaya, select goods needed locally, and then prepare prices for procurement. It has been found that all overseas Chinese in the Nanyang region have a very keen psychology of loving and using national goods. At this time of intense pressure from neighboring countries, they feel particularly indignant. The representative has now arrived in Shanghai and has opened dozens of goods, such as those of your factory, instructing them to be solicited separately. Correspondently, a letter has been sent, and Clerk Xu Qingwen has been sent to listen. Please give samples of the goods produced by your factory, as well as price lists, so that they can be forwarded. This matter concerns foreign trade, so please do not look down upon it.

<p>To Demolish Unauthorized Sheds</p>
<p>The Acting Director of the Works Department of the Municipal Council reported at the last Works Committee meeting that the Board of Directors decided last year that no more sheds would be allowed to be built anywhere, but at the beginning of this year, due to the unsettled situation, strict supervision was not possible. It is now found that there are about 1,000 unauthorized sheds, which should be demolished after giving one month's notice according to last year's case. This matter has also been discussed with the Chinese Council, which believes it is feasible. The Director of the Health Department also stated that the existence of most of these sheds is detrimental to public health, and most of the people living there can find other housing. After research by the committee, it was believed that this matter had been thoroughly investigated last year. For the sake of public health, all unauthorized sheds should be demolished after giving one month's notice according to the old case. This proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors on Wednesday.</p>

<p>At 6:50 PM the night before last, a young woman was seen standing on the Baidu Bridge outside the Suzhou Creek estuary. Taking advantage of a moment when others were not paying attention, she suddenly jumped into the river to kill herself. With a loud splash, waves scattered in all directions. Fortunately, Chinese Constable No. 35 from the Customs Water Police Station was passing by in a boat. Seeing this, he immediately took steps to rescue the woman and brought her to the police station. Under questioning, she stated her name was Yu Jin'e, 22 years old, married to a Mr. Lu. They lived at No. 3184 in the Pu'an Fang neighborhood of Hongkou. "My husband has two elder brothers and one younger brother. The younger brother, named Bingzhang, used to work on foreign ships, but he went mad and lost his job. Now he is at home, beating people arbitrarily every day and is completely unreasonable. Today, I was beaten by him again and have nowhere to seek justice, so I was so angry that I committed suicide," she said. The police officers, considering her to be narrow-minded, offered words of advice and sent a detective to summon her husband's sister-in-law, a Mrs. Qiu, who came to the station to take her home.</p>

<p>At around 12:00 AM the night before last, a young woman, about 17 or 18 years old, dressed in a fashionable qipao, suddenly came to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway South Station and asked if there was a night train to Hangzhou, which seemed suspicious. The station police saw that she was unaccompanied late at night and looked like she was running away secretly, so they became suspicious and went forward to question her. Her words were evasive, so they took the woman to the police station for interrogation. She stated her name was Xing, a young woman, 18 years old, from Donggong, Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province. Her stepfather was Xing Jingui. "In February of this year, I was seduced and became intimate with He Yihua. We eloped together to Hangzhou and lived at No. 6 Amitabha Lane, Wan'an Bridge. He worked pulling a water cart in West Lake. Later, because life was difficult, my lover He Yihua tricked me into coming to Shanghai to find work. I believed him, so I took a fourth-class train to Shanghai today. But unexpectedly, He had bad intentions and sold me to a brothel to become a prostitute. Therefore, I did not want to and taking advantage of his inattention, I fled to the train station overnight, intending to take a train back to Hangzhou." After the police station investigated and clarified the situation, they prepared a document and sent her to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care.</p>

This spring, when Jiading was occupied, the fellow villagers in Shanghai organized a relief association, and Chen especially devoted himself to presiding over it, which was deeply admirable. It was a pity that such a promising young man suddenly passed away. It was a loss not only for his fellow villagers but also for society and the country. Finally, Chen Zhaowen, representing the family, gave a speech of thanks, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e91">From Love to Magical Herbs <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Love is originally a beautiful word, but unfortunately, only a few get a happy ending from transformed love. For the sake of passionate love, unfortunate events occur, and for the sake of unrequited love, declarations of separation from marriage have become commonplace in daily newspapers. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>The river of love is full of waves, and good things are often thwarted. This is common in the process of love and is not surprising. However, recent love tragedies are mostly due to unfaithfulness, becoming victims under triangular love, and cannot be attributed to fate, saying that the river of love is full of waves, and good things are often thwarted. To remedy these shortcomings in society, one is to prevent unfortunate events from occurring due to passionate love, and the other is to prevent men and women from separating due to unrequited love. Let alone moralists or politicians of the first rank, who are unable to influence or prohibit, can only take a deep breath and politely decline. Inadvertently, I found records of "Parting Love Grass" and "Harmonious Love Grass" in the *Compendium of Materia Medica Supplement*. A mere blade of grass can control the separation and union of love between men and women. This is truly a magical herb for saving society and a remedy for passionate love and unrequited love. I have listed the origin and efficacy of the two herbs below:</p>
<p>Parting Love Grass is produced in the Yi region of Yunnan. Many civilians sell it. When people are imprisoned by emotions and desires, they often die. If you take a blade of this grass and decoct it, you will immediately wake up as if from a dream, severing ties and abandoning love, without even knowing why.</p>
<p>Harmonious Love Grass is produced outside the Lancang River in Yongchang Prefecture. The roots of the grass are pure white, forming the shape of men and women uniting. When the locals see it, they surround it with rice before digging it up, otherwise it will escape. If a couple is not harmonious, taking it will make them happy. However, when loaded on a river boat, it will sink and cannot cross. The wise use a long line to tie it to the shore, hold the line to board the boat, and then pull it over after crossing. Therefore, it is often found in the areas near the border of Yunnan Province. It is said that those who take it say that a man sees a woman, even if she is Mumu, Xishi and Wang Zhaojun are not as good. A woman sees a man, even if he is ugly, he is like Pan An; even if he is old, he is a strong man.</p>
<p>The above are all original texts from the *Compendium of Materia Medica Supplement*. If Tao Sijin had eaten Parting Love Grass, there would have been no tragedy of two females killing each other. If those who passionately loved Miss Li had eaten Parting Love Grass, there would have been no sudden change of two males killing each other. Moreover, if divorcing men and women who are making a fuss all ate Harmonious Love Grass, they would not file for divorce again, and the careers of copper-plated lawyers would be greatly affected. Can the efficacy of grass and trees be so great and miraculous? I'm afraid it's just a myth of grass and trees.</p>

<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>丨Everything should seek light and perfection丨</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival moon is the brightest and most perfect, so it is most appreciated. But when we admire the bright and perfect moon, what should we think of our country? The Northeast has been lost for a year, like a moon that is missing and incomplete. We must strive to recover our mountains and rivers, restore our country's glory, and make our four million square miles of territory bright and without blemishes, perfect and without defects, just like the Mid-Autumn Festival moon. We should also think about our country's politics. Today's politics are so dark that there is not a single ray of light, and so fragmented that they are not sound. We must use the power of the people to supervise the government, make politics clear and complete its organization, just like the brightness and perfection of the Mid-Autumn Festival moon, making it lovable. Today's society is also like the political organization, which is poor and unbearably dark. We must use a calm attitude, sharp thinking, and strong will to transform society, making its organization perfect and radiant. People living in this society are happily like dew standing under the Mid-Autumn Festival moon. Throughout history, the national salvation groups have inevitably been full of dark secrets and have not been able to achieve perfect results. How should we soundly organize it in the future? How should we make each heart become a whole? Generate great rays of light and have a harvest with perfect results, and also be like the moon tonight. The brave soldiers who are repeatedly turning over in the Northeast do not have complete weapons and sufficient supplies. There are several hundred people in the east and several thousand people in the west. How imperfect is their battle plan, and how dark and terrible is their future? How should we help them with military supplies and weapons, and give them all kinds of material and spiritual assistance, so that they can shine brightly in the Northeast, sweep away the haze, and achieve perfect results? In short, everything placed before us at present should seek its light and perfection, seeking the light and perfection of tonight's bright moon. The light and perfection of the Mid-Autumn Festival moon are indeed pleasing, and achieving light and perfection in everything at present can make people feel even happier.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Mid-Autumn Festival and the Northeast <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Baishi</p>
<p>Incense burners filled with smoke and mist filled the room, which symbolized the righteous army in the Northeast desperately emitting smoke bombs and gunpowder mist to overthrow Japanese imperialism. But thinking that when the incense burners were burned out in the middle of the night, the smoke and mist would disappear, I couldn't help but feel a chill.</p>
<p>Even when the lotus root is broken, the silk remains connected. This is originally a common saying. Unexpectedly, eating lotus root this Mid-Autumn Festival, this saying symbolized the situation in the Northeast. The Manchurian state has been created by the Japanese, but the common people still do not forget their homeland, which is clearly that even when the lotus root is broken, the silk remains connected. But thinking that when putting the lotus root into my mouth, the silk that is still connected must also be broken. I feel even more of a chill.</p>
<p>Mooncakes are an indispensable ornament for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and they can also symbolize China's national power. China is like a whole mooncake. The east is a concession, and the west is a colony, just like being peeled of skin. Now the Japanese simply open their mouths wide and bite off a large piece of the Northeast. The pastry filling is also exposed. Moreover, the Japanese are still drooling over what is left after they bite. Thinking of this, I feel even more apprehensive.</p>

<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>丨Cut open the mooncake, and leave a corner丨</p>
<p>The young masters and young ladies who have climbed out of the swimming pool are about to try on new autumn clothes. 丨Life is always so fresh, lively, and lovely: in the active and sweet spring, it is always so immersed and washed: the smooth asphalt road is suitable for the Austin cars of 1932 to speed: the major companies with autumn sales are suitable for young ladies and young wives to choose diamond jewelry and dazzling silk fabrics of various colors: what makes the lives of young masters and young ladies more comfortable and richer is the rise of greater department stores and the creation of the world's most modern cinemas: the form of life is always a melody, that is: confusion, decadence, licentiousness, and sinking丨</p>
<p>Autumn has come. In the city, you will not feel the desolation of autumn. If there is, it is only the rushing of autumn festival gifts and the items used for enjoying the Mid-Autumn Festival. That lotus seed paste and mixed nuts Cantonese mooncake, accompanied by the lovely autumn atmosphere under the cool and bright moon, this, together with the young masters and young ladies appreciating the fresh "flowers" in spring, the seven-colored "rainbow" after the summer rain, and the rich poetic atmosphere and the cool feeling that cools the lungs of the "round bright moon" on an autumn night, this should make people forget thousands of times of troubles and ten thousand times of sorrows丨</p>
<p>But, cut open the mooncake, and leave a corner丨That quarter of the Northeast that has been seized, under the "round bright moon" shining on the 30 million compatriots outside the customs who are shedding tears and fighting to the death, when you are eating coconut, mixed nuts, and ham mooncakes, to commemorate the tragic pain of your 30 million compatriots locked up outside the customs, I hope you will leave a corner for them as a memorial of mourning丨</p>
<p>The bright moon is lovely, and the Northeast is even more lovely丨One-quarter of the land, our 30 million compatriots丨</p>

<p>(7)</p>
<p>"Then you became a regiment commander," you must be very happy now; perhaps your hometown and everything from the past are no longer valuable, causing you to occasionally reminisce?"</p>
<p>"What! As long as I have a breath of life, I will not forget the traces of the past; as long as I have a little bit of inspiration, I am always thinking about how to make my dear Fenruo happy. You should know how uncomfortable I was in my heart the day you decided to marry. But I didn't want to learn the cowardice of ordinary people by swallowing sleeping pills or jumping into the sea to commit suicide. I only thought about how to punish you so that at some point, in some environment, you would feel that marrying this battalion commander was completely wrong, and that adapting to the demands and expectations of your family was also a huge fallacy. I still trust myself. I am definitely not a schoolteacher in the making. I can definitely be like the Chinese saying, 'mount the horse to kill bandits, dismount the horse to draft proclamations'; or like the divine bravery of medieval Western knights, or within a certain period of time, snatch you to my place from your husband's hands. Alas, I was so indignant at the time, and the blood in my whole body was boiling. And you, you were enjoying the happiness of your new marriage, with another man leaning on you and embracing you. How would you know that your sinner had abandoned everything and fled to the army?"</p>
<p>"Yes, this is my fault, and also my misfortune. But now, everything is over. Besides praying that you will always be happy and fulfill your responsibilities to the country and the people, I have no other thoughts."</p>
<p>"Then you have no regrets about living this kind of life?"</p>
<p>"I can't blame anyone anymore. Blaming my own fate is also meaningless. Beautiful youth, like flowing water, has already passed. I don't plan to ask for anything more before I breathe my last."</p>
<p>"But if you don't ask for anything, doesn't that mean I'm not allowed to have any wishes?"</p>
<p>"Of course, this is an exception. You should have bigger wishes: a lovely wife, smart children, work that will shock the whole world</p>
<p>and save all of mankind from depravity. You should wish for it, you should achieve your goals. But you shouldn't come here again, to meet your former unfortunate friend."</p>
<p>"Can't you make your thoughts more beautiful, the same as before? Can't you make your life more joyful, surpassing the past and the present? My indignation from the past has now turned into earnest longing. I am willing to forget all the old hatred, but I don't want to forget the passion you had for me. I don't believe your youth has passed. What I see before me is still the beautiful Fenruo from thirteen years ago. I don't want you to suffer for the rest of your life, living with a madman forever, I don't want you to embroider wedding dresses for other people's daughters forever. I want to see you embraced by me, embroidering a wedding dress for yourself for my sake."</p>
<p>"Alas, please forgive me. Although I only married for two months before my husband died, leaving me lonely and desolate until now, the families and relatives of the two families in between have slowly died, leaving only a bored and immortal me. But I want to save someone before I die. That person is that madman. Poor thing, he is also a pitiful wretch. Please allow me, don't oppose me or deprive me of my will. But your affection, I will take to my coffin and be eternally grateful for."</p>

<h3 id="e96">Financial and Gold Markets React and Fall Back <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Falling back by more than five taels, yesterday's gold auction market showed a reaction and fell. There were some twists and turns in between, but the overall market did not fall back by more than four taels. Looking back, the near and far months of the overseas silver market uniformly reported contractions. However, the price of gold was just the opposite. It initially fell, because the footing of the silver bars was not good. The United States posted a premium of 125 or more after the market closed, as if there were buyers. Therefore, the market turned firm, which affected it. The psychology of the industry tended to weaken. Afterwards, because the swap had already started, the exchange was based on the level of the discount. However, with a rise and fall of two or three taels, the foreign exchange deviated, and short positions were seen, making the market even more lackluster. Because of Wednesday, the agents of each gold firm had previously requested the exchange to close the market, but were not allowed. Although the exchange issued another notice yesterday advising them to operate as usual, the representatives would not rest until their goal was achieved, so they did not open the market. However, they all arrived at the exchange at 4:30 PM as scheduled, and then dispersed. The swap starts on the 16th of each month, but each firm must start one day earlier. However, the 15th was a holiday for the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar, so trading only started yesterday morning. The discount was still posted by the short side, initially four taels to 3.8 taels. Then, because the bulls were unwilling to lightly swap, it was pushed up to 6.89 taels to seven taels, and finally returned to 5.5 taels, with a little more than six taels. It is said that most of the major bulls did not take action, but there were quite a few transactions. The Guangbang Hengxing shorts swapped about 2,000 or so, and the rest will not be traded until the 16th. Now, the details of the morning market are recorded below.</p>
<p>There were not many twists and turns in the morning market. The opening price for October was 724 taels, a drop of three taels. Although the large bars and the price of silver both contracted by one-half, and the footing was not good, there seemed to be a reaction. The private telegram was only 5/16 lower (but the gross price had been done at 25.26 taels). Then, Zhao Fengchang, Xie Xingyong, Bingxing came in, and was raised from 23.4 taels to 24.9 taels. The English Gold Bank absorbed 19.5 for December. Subsequently, because Hengxing, Yuanhong, Kang Yong, Yuanxing, Yongfutaiheng, Dadecheng and others sold, and HSBC sold to Mitsui 31.25 in September of British gold, it fell slightly by three taels. At 9:30, it was 21.9 taels. HSBC also posted half a notch higher, 125 each for British and American. Then it rose because retail investors came in, seeing 23.4 taels. At 9:45, the swap suddenly started, but the price was not very high, only about four taels or so were posted by the shorts. Therefore, Fuyu, Yongfeng, Bingxing, Xiexing, Yongyifeng, Yonghengchang, Yongdadecheng and others sold off, probably because October US dollars could be settled at 31 yuan, and September British gold at 19.375. Therefore, at 9:50, it was 21.4 taels. Later, seeing the large swap, Hengxing and others came in to swap, and buyers also poured in, such as Ruixing, Yuanmao, Yongyuantai, Hengyu, Shenkang, Qianchang, Xiang and others. In particular, Mitsui absorbed 1875 of December US dollars, reaching 25.1 taels at 10:10. However, Hengxing sold, and Zhao Fengchang, Yuanyuanmao and others also sold, so it retreated by more than two taels. However, from 10:15 to 11:00, there were only a few cents of trading. At 11:10, it was 22.3 taels, and then added one tael, making it three and a half taels. After 11:30, it suddenly became soft and tired, because this month's US dollars were matched at 9375, and December at 25. Moreover, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Zhao Fengchang, Futaiheng, Hengyu, Tong Taichang and others came to compete for sale, so the price could not be supported, and it plunged by more than two taels. At 11:45, it was 20.08 taels. Retail shorts only closed early because there was no market today to guard against unforeseen changes. Therefore, the price added another tael, making it 22 taels. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 21.7 taels, and then it was done at 22.67 taels. However, people's hearts were dazed. Compared with the posting price the day before yesterday, it had fallen back by 5.3 taels, which was really unexpected. According to the half-day maximum of 25.1 taels and the minimum of 20.8 taels, there were 4.3 taels of rise and fall. The total red bar was 8.5 taels.</p>
<p>The quoted price was pressed down by two taels. The quoted price was 125 for the US dollar, and it went up to 784 taels, pressing it down by 61.2 taels to 65 or so, and then 62 taels, which was two taels more than the previous day. The registration and water replenishment was 22 taels.</p>
<p>The amount of bars is already felt to be lacking. Trading on the table is still active, and most of them are squeezing straight bars. In total, Yuanmaoyong, Qianchangxiang, Ruixing, Tongtaichang, Yuantai, Hengxingyuan, Yuhe, Fuxingyong and others all came in. Hengyu, Daxingyong, Shunli, Xiexingyong, Hengchangyong and others occasionally came in and out. Zhifengyong, Wanxing, Hengxing, Fuyu, Hongkangyong, Yuanxingyong, Futaiheng, Zhao Fengchang, Bingxing, Yifengyong, Dadecheng all came out. The rest is complicated and impermanent. The Dalian gang only sold more than 200 bars and bought more than 100 bars. The Guangbang (Hengxing) sold more than 700 bars. The amount of bars in each firm is especially felt to be lacking, only counting within 20,000 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Foreign Exchange Rises Simultaneously in Open and Black Markets <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Although the silver market all reported declines yesterday, the exchange rates for British increased and American decreased. However, the market in this port was just the opposite. In fact, because the price of silver had fallen too sharply, there was still fear of a reverse rise. Therefore, the HSBC listing was extended by half a notch, 125 each for British and American exchanges. The rest also increased. However, Hong Kong did not change. As for the domestic market, it gradually loosened, from being flat in the morning, and then tending to be tight. As a result, compared with the previous day, British gold increased by .0625, and American gold increased by .1875. The gold market also saw a reaction, falling by 5 taels. Since the swap had already started, the discount was not very large. Chinese merchants traded frequently. Today (the 15th) is the Autumn Festival, and all banks and gold exchanges are closed for one day, so yesterday's market was even more active. It is estimated that tens of thousands of pounds of British gold were traded, with varying inflows and outflows. Each bank did a little matching. Sassoon &amp; Co. sold a total of 5-6 million US dollars in December. Most of the gold industry hedged to cover short positions, with some hedging gold auctions. The afternoon market was closed as usual, and it is expected that large bars will rise.</p>
<p>The domestic market for British exchange rose and fell by 125 in half a day. The morning opening price for September was 1 shilling 9 pence 1875, October 25, November 3125, December 375. The buying price for each month was increased by .0625. Huabi bought 9 and a half pence in December. Zhongfu also absorbed 9 and a half pence in December (Sassoon out). HSBC and Mitsui matched 3125 in September. Sumitomo issued 375 in September. The closing price at noon was 9 pence 3125 to half a yuan, and the buying price was 375 to 5625.</p>
<p>The domestic market for American exchange rose and fell by 1875 in the first half of the day. The morning opening price for September was 30.75 yuan, October 8125, November 1 yuan, December 125. The buying price was 30.875 yuan to 1.25 yuan. Huabi issued 30.875 yuan in October. HSBC and Mitsui did each other's 30.875 yuan in October. North Korea issued 1 yuan in October. Maihang issued 1.25 yuan in December. Huabi and Shanghai matched 1 yuan in October. Macaulay and Citibank both issued 1.25 yuan in December. Shanghai and HSBC both spent 1.1875 yuan in December. HSBC issued 30.875 yuan in October. Mitsui absorbed 1.1875 yuan in December. Pangen absorbed 1.0625 yuan in November. Anda issued 30.75 yuan in September. Shanghai bought from the Netherlands 30.9375 yuan in September. Mitsui and Zhengjin matched 1.25 yuan in December. Shanghai issued 1.3125 yuan in December. The closing price at noon was 30.875 yuan to 1.25 yuan, and the buying price was 1 yuan to 375. Also, one US dollar is equivalent to 3 taels, 2 qian, 6 fen, and 53 li of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Large Bar Telegram Reports Rise <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 14th, telegram, large bars have seen a recovery, the closing price for the near term is 17 pence 9375, an increase of 1875 compared to the previous day, and the far term is 18 pence, an increase of 25.

<p>Yesterday, the market atmosphere for both silver and foreign dollars was due to the eagerness of sellers in terms of transactions, and the influx of foreign funds was also abundant. Although there were buyers, the situation was ultimately seen as deteriorating. The settlement situation in the silver market was also quite stable, but the influx of funds was very abundant. Although the allocation of funds by banks was commensurate with supply and demand, the limited use led to a surplus.</p>
<p>The dismantling rate is consistently downstream. The morning dismantling rate for "foreign cents" was 6 qian, 9 fen, 1 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, half, a decrease of 3 hao, 7 hu, half compared to the afternoon market the previous day. The afternoon market changed to an increase of 1 hao, 2 hu, half, to 6 qian, 9 fen, 1 li, half. The result was 3 hao, 7 hu, half better than the morning market the previous day. The "silver dismantling" rate was 3 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of 1 fen compared to the previous day. The allocated funds added 3-4 fen.</p>

The transaction volume was 7,000 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market continued to fall on Tuesday (13th) due to the election and the uncertainty of the political situation. Bulls therefore took the opportunity to close out their positions. The Democratic Party's victory in Maine initially caused the stock market to plummet by more than 13 yuan. Although people pulled it back afterwards, the rebound was also fierce, but the result was still a huge drop compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 5.1 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The Yarn Market Remains Flat and Weak</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market rose in the afternoon after falling in the morning. The situation is still weak. The Rongxing bull is still struggling hard, but retail investors generally believe that the overseas cotton market is sluggish, and their desire to sell short is unusually strong. The momentum is strong, and the prospects are lacking in confidence. However, the current inventory is not very thick, and it can still support it for a while, but most people are watching the decline.</p>
<p>The morning decline and afternoon rebound in the People's Standard. The People's Standard opened in the morning, and American cotton fell again. Selling was strong, and retail investors closed out their positions. Each month fell 6, 7, 8, 9 qian to 1 tael, and broke through the 9 tael mark. Later, as those who profited closed out their positions, the market price rebounded slightly. Each month rose 4, 5, 6, 7 qian to 1 tael. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 40,100 bales. It was found that Mind was sold 1,300 bales, Senkang 1,550 bales, Hengde 1,150 bales, Changfeng 1,750 bales, and Xincheng 1,000 bales. Gengfeng was bought 3,000 bales, Changji 950 bales, Yichang 900 bales, Dachang 1,000 bales, and Tonghe 1,350 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales are sluggish. Spot yarn sales are still sluggish. It was found that a total of 550 bales were purchased throughout the day. The market price of new factory Ren Zhong yarn fell sharply by 1 tael and 5 qian. The purchase amounts of each party are listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 110 Hankou 10 Fujian 25 Colleagues 85</p>
<p>Anqing 105 Guangdong 160 Ningbo 3</p>
<p>The cotton market is dominated by selling.</p>
<p>American cotton fell again and again. The 8 fen mark for the distant months has also been broken. People were very panicked in the morning, and most believed that the prospects for American cotton were not good. Therefore, the Xincheng sellers took advantage of the situation and pursued, and threw out more than 10,000 dan, increasing the total short position to more than 100,000 dan. However, retail investors generally believe that the recent decline has been too violent, and the price of gold is difficult to be small, so those who are stable are holding a wait-and-see attitude. The prospects for American cotton are hard to predict.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard is loose and weak. The Zheng Standard opened in the morning. Because the decline in American cotton was still strong, the selling atmosphere in the market was very strong. Each month fell 2-3 qian, and 2-3 disks rebounded again. As a result, it fell 5 fen to 2 qian. In the afternoon, only October rose by 3 qian, and the remaining months rose by 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 86,800 dan. It was found that Xincheng was sold 12,800 dan, Ruidai 4,100 dan, Dafeng 2,300 dan, Yudai 2,700 dan, and Changfeng 1,900 dan. Gengfeng was bought 4,600 dan, Heshen 3,100 dan, Changfeng 3,900 dan, Yuandai 2,400 dan, Changhe 1,500 dan, and Hengyi 1,500 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>December 3245 … 278,200</p>
<p>Raw cotton is also affected by American cotton. The need for raw cotton has also turned sluggish again. Because the decline in American cotton is too strong, procurement has stopped again. The source is estimated to be 2,176 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to the weakness of Wall Street and the liquidation of Southern sets. Sellers were active and weak. Futures fell 28-31 points, spot fell 35 points. English cotton futures fell 32-33 points, and spot fell 36 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell 40 points. The Indian cotton market was stable, with Ping Guoer falling 19.75 rupee, Aomula falling 14.25 rupee, and Bailuoxi falling 15 rupee.

<p>Autumn Festival Rice Market Also Suspends Trading for One Day</p>
<p>Yesterday in the Shanghai South rice market, the supply from the West Road was limited, and trading within the local street was slight. Four loads of newly arrived "Du Yang Jian" rice were sold out the same day at a price increase of two jiao. There were slight quantities of "Chang Xi Bei Geng" and "Su Tong Bang Xiang Wei" rice, which followed suit with a small increase. However, the sales of superior fragrant rice were sluggish, and the price dropped by about half a dollar.</p>
<p>Over ten boats carrying "Xin Zha Chang Xi Xian Zi" and other types of rice arrived at the New Gate wharf. The sales situation within the local street was not good. The market situation for various goods was weak and tight. Thick, fresh "Geng" rice was offered at a price increase of nearly one jiao. Early and late rice sales were mediocre, without significant price fluctuations. There was no distinction in price for new goods. River mills were opening at around 2,500 cash per shi. From tomorrow, trading houses will close their books for the accounting period and suspend trading for one day. No reports were received from the North and South markets, and it is said that trading will resume as usual on the 16th.</p>
<p>Sales of Imported Rice Improve in Local Street</p>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market saw sluggish wholesale sales. The general market only saw the North Bank handle 200 bags of small-grain rice. Otherwise, there were no inquiries. However, there was still interest in the local street. Due to scarce inventory of Saigon rice, those who had it were treating it as a rare commodity. However, due to sufficient stock of small-grain rice in the market and the availability of new river rice and guest rice, it was still difficult for the market to improve. Yesterday, 2,000 bags were offered, and the market improved slightly. Other types of rice also saw a slight increase. The general market offered 2,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice at a price of 9 yuan, 3 jiao and a half to 2 jiao and 8 fen; 800 bags of small-grain rice at a price of about 8 yuan, 6 jiao and a half to 3 jiao and a half; 800 bags of Siam rice at a price of 9 yuan; and 260 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice at a price of 13 yuan and a half to 12 yuan and 8 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Flour Prices Decline <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a gradual decline in prices across all months after the opening. Although imported wheat prices fluctuated slightly, the market sentiment was stable at the opening. However, later, factories such as Fu Feng continued to release flour due to surplus imported wheat they had already contracted for, and smaller factories also followed suit. This led to a decline in opening prices, which were about one or two fen lower than the previous day. During the afternoon session, the price for the current month fell to as low as 9 qian and 5 li. Prices for later months also showed weakness. Subsequently, due to the competition from the Fuzhou and Fuduo groups, the market sentiment improved slightly, and prices recovered by nearly a fen from their lowest point. However, with imported wheat available for purchase and rice prices remaining low and loose, it was difficult for the flour market to look promising. As a result, prices for September and October fell by 7 li compared to the previous day, November and December fell by 2 and a half li, January fell by 5 li, and February fell by 1 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a generally flat and weak trend in the morning and afternoon sessions across all months. There were few transactions in the morning sessions, and the market remained stable. The afternoon sessions were more active. Although there were no large-scale sales, imported wheat could be ordered (it was rumored that not only Fu Feng had contracted for imported wheat, but also Fu Xin and Xin Da, at a price of 3 liang and 8 qian), and this avenue was not blocked. If the situation stabilized, hedging transactions would surely occur again, so the bullish sentiment softened, and prices for all months gradually weakened. As a result, the price for the current month was down by 1 fen compared to the previous day, October down by 1 fen, November down by 2 fen, December down by 3 fen, and January and February down by 2 fen. The current wheat market remains stable. The opening price for Huangqiao wheat was 3 liang, 5 qian and 2 fen; Zhenjiang wheat 3 liang and 4 qian and a half; and Anting wheat 3 liang and 3 qian, with a total of 2,000 bags offered.</p>

<p>According to a report from Xin Feng Foreign Firm, Chicago wheat prices on Tuesday (the 13th) initially fell due to the weakness of the New York stock market but later recovered due to better export demand. As a result, there was little change compared to the previous day (the 12th). The total volume traded was 40 million bushels. The closing prices for the 13th are listed below:</p>

<p>Foreign Firms' Silk Market Continues Weak</p>
<p>Prices for Chinese silk in European and American markets continue to decline. European and American firms in Shanghai are feeling the pressure to suppress prices and accumulate inventory. Factories have insufficient stock and little intention to sell. Yesterday, only San Mao and others purchased 13 to 15 bundles of Sichuan yellow silk from the factory at a price of 545 taels. Xin Fu and others purchased 15 bundles of Gong Ma Si brand Shun Hao Seven Star white silk at a price of 455 taels.</p>

<p>Nansha Model Silk-producing Area Only Yields Slightly More Than 300 Jin</p>
<p>Nansha in Shaoxing has been designated as a model silk-producing area by the Zhejiang Construction Department. It has a guidance center, and all procedures such as seed distribution, disinfection, egg incubation, and mulberry feeding are conducted under the supervision of instructors. Therefore, the results are the best. The new cocoon harvest is about 80% of a normal year. The fresh cocoons collected by the autumn cocoon production and sales cooperative are currently being dried in order, and the drying loss is the lowest. On average, 306 jin of fresh cocoons can be dried into 100 jin of dry cocoons. Other reports indicate a drying loss requiring 312 jin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Tunxi high-grade green tea from the British firm Tian Yu Foreign Firm saw some activity as it received foreign demand and purchased over 400 cases. However, goods from Wuyuan and Northwest villages remained sluggish. Many sellers disliked the high price. Needle-shaped green tea and other varieties saw active trading, but opening prices were 7 to 8 taels lower. In addition, although the inventory of Qimen black tea was only slightly over 10,000 cases, British and American firms showed little interest in purchasing due to the low prices of Indian tea. The market was almost completely stagnant.</p>

<p>Head Scarves are In Demand</p>
<p>The trend for wool head scarves for Western-style clothing is quite good. As the weather turns cold, retail sales are gradually picking up, and there is a sudden increase in customers selecting clothing for autumn. The sales situation is therefore good, and market sentiment is rising and becoming more active. Woolen shops in the Hongkou area are now rushing to produce samples and are extremely busy soliciting orders from tailors. Hua Wei head scarves are priced at 7 liang and 2 qian and a half, Hua Lun at 5 liang and 7 qian and a half, Lin Nan at 7 liang, and Tian Xiang and Rong Tai at 3 liang and 8 qian and a half to 4 liang and 4 qian.</p>

<p>— Parasite</p>
<p>In the issue of the 本埠 supplement of our newspaper on September 7th, Mr. Quan's cartoon depicted a monk sitting in lotus position, chanting and tapping a wooden fish, with the inscription "Social Parasite" above it. After seeing it, I couldn't help but feel the need to speak out on behalf of the monks. It's not because I sympathize with their reliance on alms for sustenance, nor am I advocating for them or righting wrongs. However, because Mr. Quan used the phrase "social parasite," I felt that his criticism was somewhat biased. The parasites in China are not limited to monks, and among monks, there are producers as well. Now, let me just talk about Shanghai. Generally speaking, those who live in Western-style houses, eat fancy meals, and ride in cars, loafing around all day without doing anything, as well as those who want to work but society doesn't give them the opportunity, driving the strong to robbery and the weak to begging, are not under discussion. I'm just asking, from the highest-ranking government official to the lowest street vendor, who is a producer? If we consider these people to be non-producers, then what should we call them? Aren't they social parasites? Moreover, apart from low-level clerks and rickshaw pullers, their lives are much more comfortable than those of the hardworking farmers and laborers who toil day and night. I don't know the exact population of Shanghai, and I certainly can't give you an accurate proportion of parasites to those being parasitized, but based on the current situation, I can boldly assert that the ratio is almost one to one hundred: "99 parasites for every 1 person being parasitized." Furthermore, these high-level parasites not only don't produce themselves, but they also desperately consume goods from abroad, "buying foreign goods," making it impossible for the producing compatriots being parasitized to survive. Isn't this a desire for mutual destruction?</p>
<p>My humble article is not intended to criticize Mr. Quan's cartoon for being incorrect. It's just that Mr. Quan's inscription "social parasite" aroused a social concept in my chest that I had long wanted to express but hadn't yet. (Payment received)</p>

<h3 id="e115">A Discussion on Four-Dimensional Space (Continued) <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>From this perspective, time and space are indeed equally important.</p>
<p>Now, let me give a few more examples to illustrate this four-dimensional space.</p>
<p>We hardly ever see things in one-dimensional space. However, I once heard a story like this: A mantis was walking on the road. Suddenly, a general's car came from ahead, but it still bravely moved forward without yielding. So, it sacrificed itself. This story was originally about the bravery of the mantis, but perhaps it was because the mantis didn't have a sufficient understanding of two- or three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>Regarding two-dimensional space, I remember an ancient saying: "Draw a circle as a prison." That is to say, if you just draw a circle around someone who has committed a mistake, he will stay there forever. This shows the honesty of the ancients. However, when we think carefully about it, perhaps it was due to the simplicity of their thinking. They only knew about two-dimensional space and hadn't yet discovered or had a sufficient understanding of three-dimensional space.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>As for three-dimensional space, our lives are in three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>The Chinese do not yet have a sufficient understanding of four-dimensional space.</p>
<p>I once heard a joke like this: A person was walking on the road and suddenly encountered heavy rain. But he still strolled along slowly. Someone asked him why he didn't run faster. His reply was that it was raining ahead too, so what was the point of running faster.</p>
<p>After hearing such a story, we certainly can't say that he is a fool. There is indeed philosophy in his words. There is nothing wrong with his words, but we can only say that he doesn't have a sufficient understanding of four-dimensional space.</p>
<p>The Chinese do indeed lack an understanding of four-dimensional space. Even in terms of language, the languages of England, France, and Germany all have a sense of time, but Chinese does not.</p>
<p>Chinese people are often late for meetings. This may also be proof of this.</p>
<p>Now, the fifth dimension is about to be discovered. China, which is lagging behind in science, should at least have a sufficient awareness of four-dimensional space.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Suggestions for Improving Accounting <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jirong</p>
<p>Accounting scholars study the principles of bookkeeping using scientific methods. Few Chinese shops and factories adopt modern accounting; even fewer use semi-modern methods. The vast majority of businesses still use the old-fashioned single-entry accounting to record their daily transactions. I recall countless cases where Chinese shops faced various problems due to unclear bookkeeping, leading to embezzlement. There are also countless instances where factory products failed to compete due to inaccurate cost calculations. Furthermore, on the household level, countless families have been bankrupted due to a lack of budgeting beforehand and no final accounting afterward. At this time when the nation is in trouble and commerce and industry are declining, and when various industries are laying off employees, it is all the more important to promote domestic goods and improve accounting practices. Moreover, under party rule, economic transparency has become a precedent. If we don't improve quickly and continue with the old ways, how can we compete successfully? How can the economy be transparent? How can families be prosperous? Here are a few suggestions for reference:</p>
<p>(1) In current social organizations, accounting positions are often filled by relatives or friends. Even those who hire accountants for audits often do so merely to avoid external advice. Therefore, accountants should conduct thorough reviews and detailed reports with a spirit of impartiality and selflessness. Do not let the public lose faith, as this would hinder the progress of the accounting profession.</p>
<p>(2) China is a world marketplace, and the competition is fierce. China's industry is still in its infancy. The government offers little promotion or protection, making it difficult to compete with foreign businesses. At this time of promoting domestic goods, Chinese merchants should improve their products and offer lower prices, striving for "low prices and good quality" to appeal to the masses. Modern cost accounting is essential for accurately calculating costs, allowing for reasonable profits even with the lowest selling price. Therefore, it is not only necessary for Chinese factories and businesses to adopt modern accounting, but larger factories should also establish cost accounting research departments to lower costs and reduce selling prices. Sales will increase accordingly, and domestic production will be promoted, with predictable results.</p>
<p>(3) The Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as the hub for the study of accounting, should regularly publish materials related to accounting for commercial reference and encouragement. Accountants should not raise their fees too high and should offer reasonable prices to promote widespread adoption.</p>
<p>(4) Schools, as the breeding ground for future talents, should add bookkeeping and accounting courses to meet social needs. Shops and factories should employ as many graduates as possible to facilitate improvement and progress. This is also important on the household level.</p>
<p>(5) Chambers of Commerce in various cities should also hire accountants or jointly discuss accounting issues with the Institute of Certified Public Accountants, allowing merchants to understand the principles and benefits of modern accounting. They should also provide guidance from time to time to promote improvement. If this can be done, the effect will be even greater.</p>
<p>School Scene</p>
<h3 id="e117">A Middle School Student <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Wei</p>
<p>This semester, there is a new face in our classroom. His face is painted as white as lime, just missing a touch of rouge and lipstick, otherwise he would almost look like a woman. He has so much perfume on him that the fragrance is overwhelming, truly a fop. He says he used to study at S University and was about to graduate, but because he needs a middle school diploma, he asked our principal's brother-in-law to introduce him.</p>
<p>This "ass-kisser" (the nickname given to him by the classmates) doesn't take studying seriously. He has probably forgotten the original intention of coming to school, so he only attends a maximum of two hours of class each day. However, there is one thing that many classmates admire about him: no matter how much he cuts class, his name never appears on the list of absentees.</p>
<p>He wastes his time like this every day. He comes back from outside (the dance hall) at six o'clock in the morning and goes to bed. He doesn't get up until half past ten, so he never attends the two classes from nine to eleven, except for the one day of formal lessons... He manages to sit in the classroom for the eleven to twelve class, but he either reads the newspaper or novels, rarely paying attention to the textbooks. As soon as he hears the dismissal bell, he is the first one out of the classroom!</p>
<p>Although he boards at the school, he is never seen in the dining hall. However, he can be found at XX Restaurant across from the school gate. (Of course! How could the school's food suit the taste of a young master like him?)</p>
<p>He seems to be able to force himself to attend the one to two class. But after two o'clock, he never comes back to the classroom. According to L, who lives in the room next to him, there is a singing tutor who brings a bird master to sing "The Female Escort" etc. from half past two. Most inexplicably, the dorm supervisor seems to be deaf at this time, not saying a word. Anyway, if any other dorm did that, he would interfere. In this respect, I must admit that this "ass-kisser" has great influence. After three o'clock, a fashionable girl comes to find him every day, and then they go out together, not returning until dawn.</p>
<p>Alas! This kind of student doesn't sincerely come to study, perhaps he's just using it as a front? And the school authorities can actually tolerate this social parasite. It's really a strange thing. Alas, education, education, actually educates such students!</p>

<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, on my way home from the office, I walked into the lane and saw many women standing in front of the Zhang family's door, talking and whispering. Everyone's eyes were all directed inside, as if there was some good show to watch, attracting so much attention from the public. Out of curiosity, I walked over to take a look and saw an old woman in her fifties sitting in the middle of the Zhang family's living room. Judging by her appearance, she was wearing a blue cotton single-layer shirt that reached past her knees, shoes with red cloth heel pulls, and a pair of round earrings as big as copper coins on her ears. Her hair was styled in a high, ingot-shaped bun on top of her head. From her strange eighteenth-century attire, I knew that she was one of the gossiping women. Five or six young women were sitting around her, all leaning their ears to listen quietly to what she was saying. Zhang's mother's eldest daughter-in-law was talking to her intently. "Granny! I've already had my bazi calculated, and I understand the problem. It's destined in my fate to have children, but will I have good news this year? Well, let me ask the Lingguan to see," the old woman said, reaching into her arms and taking out a wooden puppet about an inch long, placing it next to her ear, as if listening to the telephone. She continued, "The Lingguan says that your fate is to have children late. You'll have to wait until you're thirty-eight, still ten years away."</p>
<p>"Old woman! In that case, please ask the Lingguan again, is there any way to think of?" Zhang's eldest daughter-in-law was eager to have children and didn't care how embarrassed she was, saying this. But her snow-white face was already blushing.</p>
<p>"..." The old woman's lips trembled and moved, as if murmuring some incantation. The wooden puppet in her hand kept being stuffed to her ear for a kiss. After a while, she said, "The Lingguan has already said that it's good to plant one with you. But you need to donate four yuan for incense and candles... He told me to give you eight Qilin Sending Son pills. On the lower half of the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, use boiling water to mix it with incense ash and drink it. At that time, the Lingguan will be secretly planting a white and fat official with you."</p>
<p>"Ah! Grandma! The price is too high, can you reduce it a bit?" Zhang's eldest daughter-in-law, wants to raise a son, but finds the money a bit painful.</p>
<p>"Grandma! You don't understand. This money is not for me, it's for the Lingguan to buy incense and candles. Don't say it anymore. The Lingguan never goes back on his word!" the old woman said in a way that there was absolutely no bargaining,</p>
<p>"In that case... I will pay you four yuan, but please ask the Lingguan to make it faster..." Zhang's eldest daughter-in-law, became embarrassed at this point, and stopped talking. She hastily reached into her pocket and took out four silver dollars, handing them to the old woman.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Grandma. We always do things properly. I guarantee that by this time next year, you will be holding a little official in your hands. At that time, I will come to have a cup of wedding wine!" the old woman said, with a smile all over her face, showing a victorious mood. She stuffed the four old dollars into her arms while saying this.</p>
<p>"Lingguan... Plant a white and fat official... Incense candles... X dollars..." In an instant, such a sound came from the Yang family's living room in the west lane.</p>
<p>No Way Out</p>
<h3 id="e119">Meiying <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Ze</p>
<p>Meiying had to drop out of school because of financial reasons. Seeing her classmates happily carrying their schoolbags to school, she was left at home to live a lonely life. But it would have been nice if she could have lived comfortably at home. Because driven by bread, the whip of life hit her back again and again, she had to force herself to embark on the road to earning a living.</p>
<p>Her mother found her a job as a factory worker in a tobacco company.</p>
<p>When she went to work for the first time in the morning, she carried a food basket and walked out of the door. How ashamed she was! Because she was afraid of meeting acquaintances, she had to lower her head and walk on quiet roads.</p>
<p>At the factory, because Meiying was a novice, she was inevitably ridiculed by the foreman and the other female workers. Even when other people were joking, Meiying thought they were mocking her.</p>
<p>At mealtime, Meiying opened her food basket. A bowl of rice and a bowl of vegetables. When Meiying saw it, she couldn't help but feel a pang in her heart and secretly shed a few tears. Afraid of being seen, she had to wipe her eyes and force herself to eat a few mouthfuls of rice, then re-cover the food basket.</p>
<p>Woo, woo, woo! The whistle blew three times, and the workers were released. Many people were crowding and walking out. Meiying also followed inside.</p>
<p>On the road, she walked with sadness. Walking and walking, she unknowingly arrived at the Bund. She thought, "Eh! How did I get here? Ah! It's really heartbreaking! How much did my father and mother love me? Now, driven by the whip of life, I have to show my face and do this kind of work, and I have to be laughed at. Ah! Ah! In this world, where can I find sympathy? Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I will suffer the same embarrassment. What am I going to do?"</p>
<p>Thinking of this, her tears welled up like a spring, dripping all over her clothes, dripping on the ground.</p>
<p>For a long time, she stopped being sad, and turned around and thought, "Ah! What's there to be nostalgic for in this world? It's better to die cleanly. Even my father and mother can reduce a lot of pain."</p>
<p>After thinking, she put down her food basket and threw herself into the river.</p>
<p>The waters of the Huangpu flowed, flowed, swallowed Meiying, only raised a few whirlpools, and flowed as usual forever.</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3 id="e120">About the Beggar's Mistress <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Heng</p>
<p>Because of reproduction and sexual needs, it is of course unavoidable for everyone. However, a beggar who has no food or clothing and already has a wife, also wants to learn from the wealthy officials and get a mistress. This is something that must be recorded.</p>
<p>A friend of mine runs a small grocery store on Lujiabang Road. I often go there to chat. Next door to them is a low bungalow, which is also the residence of beggars. Yesterday, while I was chatting with my friend, there was a loud bang, which was the sound of a teacup breaking. Then three ragged men and women, tangled together, were pushed out of the low bungalow. A woman in her forties pointed at the woman in her thirties, whose nose was bleeding, and cursed: "You rotten thing, I have been his wife for more than ten years, and we have always been very harmonious. Ever since you bewitched him, he abandoned me. Today, I must tear your thing apart!" She pounced on her and grabbed the hair of the woman in her thirties, and kicked the man with her foot. Later, they were finally persuaded to stop by their neighbors. This storm in a vinegar sea finally calmed down.</p>
<p>My friend said: The man puts red candle oil and flour on his rotten leg every day, dresses up and goes to the streets to beg for money. He always gets two or three strings of cash. The woman in her thirties also goes to various lanes to pretend to be looking for her husband, crying and looking very pitiful, so sometimes she can still cheat three or four yuan a day. She is the woman he recently took as a mistress, considered his concubine. The woman in her forties, is the first wife, goes to beg people to sue for money. My friend also said: my little grocery store is really not as good as them, they are even lending money at high interest!</p>
<p>"Hmm, this deformed society!" I couldn't help but sigh. (Payment received)</p>
