<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯調查團成功之先例翰·</h3>
<p>日前李頓爵士應外次郭泰祺之宴。席次贈言。謂「國聯成立已届十年。遭遇危機已非一次。莫不設法消弭。從未失敗。念已往之成績。深信今茲之事件。必得圓滿之解决。」聊聊數語。其自信力與責任心溢於言表。我人除希望其克盡責任完成自信以外。更有何說。爵士所謂已往之成績。以我人思之。其最著者殆惟一九二五年之布希糾紛一事乎。</p>
<p>考一九二五年十月二十二日。希臘軍大舉犯布加里亞。佔布國之邊境。布政府馳電日内瓦。要求召集行政會。引用盟約第十條及第十一條。行政院開會後第一步工作。即在設法停止敵對行爲。第二步工作。勒令希臘撤兵。結查皆如國聯所願。是時主席白里安居間斡旋。尤爲努力。痛斥一般不守盟約之國家。供自衛之名。行侵略之實。行政會且决議組織一調查團。任務約分三點。第一調查事實。判明責任。第二規定賠償。第三建議解决糾紛方法。白里安以。此一事件。得循國聯正當之徑。進行順手。至以爲報而英外長張伯倫。更認此一事件。足爲任何會員國之楷模。當時首先贊成張伯倫之發言者。日本代表安達是也。</p>
<p>調查團工作之結果。確定希臘侵占布國之土地。實係違反盟約。任何託辭。皆不足掩飾此侵略之事實。而賠償之責。亦即由希臘任之。統觀全案。自始至終。依據盟約。迅速解决。而調查團之工作。實與有力。當時調查團工作完竣。行政會特組織一審查委員會。委員長適爲日本代表安達。其瀋查報告。尤義正詞嚴。曰「侵犯鄰國之土地。雖爲種環境所逼迫。亦决不能掩飾違約之事實。而圖卸賠償責任。我人認此爲最高之原則。必得行政院全體之贊同。」　　此誠國聯解决糾紛案中最光榮之一頁也。是時非特白里安輩堅持正義。不可撓屈。即日代表亦知國聯約章之尊嚴。有儼然不可侵犯之色。然返觀今日中日之糾紛。則何如耶。自去年東北起事以來。遷延已經半載。日本旣唾棄盟約於不顧。而其侵略中國土地之面積。雖西歐任何大國所不及其影響直足牽動世界之和平乃國聯之所以處斷此事。能如昔日之主張公道。絶不爲强權所威脅耶。此事以前之成績且勿論。以後進行。能挽救以前之需滯而追踪解决布希糾紛之光榮耶。</p>
<p>調查團諸公。果欲期「今茲之事件必得圓滿之解决」乎追踪解决布希糾紛之光榮乎。則請一讀最近薛西爾爵士之儻言。爵士之言曰「將來之解决。若不懲治不正當之侵略。若不駁斥黷武政策若不保證國聯忠貞之會員獲所被加害之賠償。則將使國際道德受一危害之打擊」薛丁爾爵士之言揆諸大戰後國際之新道德。亦絶非陳義過高之論。布希糾紛。已成先例。我人惟希望調查團勉力爲之。以自全其信義而已。李頓爵士昨在酬答大學代表詞中。希望「會員國維持和平。心口一致。」今觀安達代表之言如彼。而日本自身之行爲則如此。然則如日本者。非心口最不一致之國家乎。常此心口不一致。則調查團工作之前途。荆棘多矣。我人又不能不爲國聯前途憂。</p>

<h3>王曉籟致辭</h3>
<p>此次國聯調查團諸君、因敝國發生空前之非常狀態、惠然蒞止、鄙人等得盡竭誠歡迎之忱、不勝榮幸、國聯自成立以來、甫逾十稔、爲日尙淺、就其所處理國際紛爭之事而論、雖未能謂爲充分發揮其權威、然亦皆有相當之效果、使一般國家咸知除武力外别有解决爭端之塗徑、是以吾人歷來之感想、不能不認爲國聯已有相當之成功、國際已關一新時代、不幸而於去年九月十八日、突有日本軍隊佔據瀋陽之事發生、未幾而於十一月十八日又佔據黑龍江·本年一月三日又佔錦州·一月二十八日又以其海軍陸戰隊襲攻閘北、於各地肆行破壞焚燒、三月一日攻佔離上海七十里之瀏河、同日其一手製造之滿洲僞政府、在長春宣告成立、所有國際聯盟約章·華盛頓九國公約·凱洛格非戰公約·均爲之破壞餘、國際聯盟開會一镒、則日軍在華之暴行進展一次、此種舉動、直接予全世界以威脅、間接即予國聯以威脅、於是國際聯盟竟遭遇自成立以來所未有之困難、辦理異常棘手、不得已乃有國聯調查團之派遣、諸公承國聯之推舉、連翩來華、質言之、遠東事變之能否消弭、世界和平之能否保全、繫於國聯雙肩、而國聯之能否措置盡善、則繫於諸公之調查報告、故諸公此來、不啻以國聯將來之生命、托付於諸公雙肩、其任務之重大、實非尋常言詞所可形容、按國聯當時議决、派遣調查團之時、本以滿洲事變爲主、雖於諸公起程在途之日、即有滬戰發生、事變愈形擴大、然日人之肆擾東南、本爲欲鞏固其在東北竊據之勢力而起、故滬事仍當歸納於東北事件之中、當諸公來華之後、東三省無一中國能自由行使政權之機關、旣無中國官吏可以訪問、又無公家　案可以參考、敝會敢斷言、諸公在東三省調查所得之資料、必均爲已經過日人修改、或出於日人製造之資料、故敝會以爲欲求明瞭事實之眞相起見、對於東三省以外我國公私各團體之叙述、諸公實有竭誠傾聽之必要、不揣冒昧、敢總括爲三大端、以貢左右、按日人此次在東三省突然用兵佔據之理由、無非藉口中國不尊重條約、對於懸案、延不解决、以致彼武人不能靜待、不得已遂取自由行動、此層證諸日兵佔據瀋陽以後、日内閣開始閣議追認其行爲、可爲確證、日人動詆中國爲不合近代組織之國家、試問軍人在外自由行動、不受其政府指揮、此種國家、可謂合於近代之國家乎、此層認爲無關宏旨、姑不深論、其指摘中國最大之理由、第一爲不尊重條約、以敝會觀察、則不尊重條約者常在日本、不在中國、此可以不列各事證明之、蓋日本今日在東三省釀中外外交史上稀有之惡化、皆由於㈠設置所謂南滿鐵路守備隊、㈡設置所謂南滿鐵道附屬地、㈢於遼吉兩省設置日本警察、茲逐一詳爲分析、則南滿鐵道設置守備隊之權利、本係據照俄人在中東鐵路之先例、自日俄議和以後、日本曾與中國訂約、一俟俄國人將東淸鐵道守備隊撤退以後、日本即當同時撤退、然俄國東淸鐵道守備隊自民國七年即已撤退、而日軍則踞守南滿鐵道如故、由此言之、究係日本不尊重條約乎、抑係中國不尊重條約乎、其次所謂南滿鐵道附屬地、按照中俄所訂東省鐵路合同、祗有鐵道用地免付地租之權利、他無規定、而宣統元年中俄所訂哈爾濱公議會辦事大綱、明認鐵道用地治理之權、屬於中國、至中日兩國所訂東三省善後條欵、對於所謂南滿鐵道附屬地者、更屬毫無規定、而日本則以南滿鐵道視爲關東租借地之延長、對於行政司法三權、無不攘奪凈盡、由此言之、究係日本不尊重條約乎、抑係中國不尊重條約乎、日人在遼吉兩省、遍地設有日警、民國五年、曾經我國外交部調查、謂遼寗一省、未有日軍者、祗有七縣、曾於鄭家屯案件結束時、令其照約撤退、日人雖毫無可以藉口之根據、而設警區域、迄今依然如故、由此言之、究係日本不尊重條約乎、抑係中國不尊重條約乎、其指摘中國最大之理由、第二謂懸案延不解决、此層可分下列三點說明、㈠懸案延不解决、係國際間常有之事、即以中國論、與其他各國亦有歷時許久未能解决之案、惟不訴之外交方式、而突用兵佔踞、則顯係蔑視　際盟約之暴行、㈡中國提出向日本交涉之案、日本延不解决者、據我國外交部所宣佈、亦有數十起之多、假使中國亦效日本之舉動、日本是否容認、㈢日本于東三省自由行動、如安奉鐵道改築寬軌、鮮農之强佔華人田產、皆以軍警爲護符、爲事實上之進展、故懸案之延不解决、係日本之利益、中國之苦痛、中國自始並無延不解决懸案之意思、其所以延不解决者、實由於日人之播弄手叚、欲以地方政府爲對手、而不願中央與聞、以致迄今成爲僵局、其指摘中國最大之理由、第三節所謂鐵道平行線問題、此層吾人亦可以下列四點說明之、（一）中日所訂東省善後條欵、祇承認日本繼承俄國所劃讓之南滿鐵道權利、關於平行線之問題、該約並未提及、嗣後祗有兩國使臣交換商談之照會、未經政府批准、不能作爲根據、此層即日本學者亦予承認、㈡即照兩國使臣互換之照會而論、關於平行線之距離、亦以俄國借欵所辦之正太鐵道爲標準、而我國所辦之打通瀋海各路、距離南滿線已在三百華里以外、絶無發生平行線爭議之可能、㈢東三省當局以洮昻路向日本借欵之時、日人以該段屬於北滿範圍、旣得此借欵利益、自願將打通瀋海吉海之爭議、置諸不論、日後何能再行藉口、㈣中國在東省新築各路、實際上並未足以威脅南滿鐵道之生存、有該鐵道總裁之自述、可以參考、日本初派内田康哉爲總裁、原其本意、亦欲以外交手腕、徐圖解决、不過該國武人、借此爲發難地耳、故吾人根據以上事實、可得下列之結論、㈠日本所謂東三省權利、被中國侵害至不能容忍之地位、多係張大其詞、按諸事實絶對相反、㈡爭端不訴之於外交手段、而任令武人窮兵黷武、自由攘奪其隣國領土、按照國聯盟約、實爲絶不可恕之罪惡、更有一層、吾　應當注意者、日人於初占遼吉後、猶謂一俟該國僑民生命財產能確保其安全、</p>
<p>當撤兵猶未敢公然認東三省爲彼國領土、提倡永不撤兵也、其後見占據黑龍江、國聯不能制裁、佔據錦州、而國聯不能制裁、於是其一手製造之傀儡國家、公然出現、大開其所謂僞國會議、列席者有日本之領事、關東州之屬員、而海陸軍人亦靡不連翩戾止、發表主張、從前猶謂此項　竊政府之樹立、日本官吏並不與聞、今尙有何辭以自解、從前雖不願撤兵、而不敢公然謂不撤兵、今則日本竟主張移植内地三師團或五師團於滿洲、以充僞國之國防矣、諸公尙以日本歷次對世界之宣言、爲可信乎、吾人敢謂日本侵略中國本無一定之限度、惟默觀形勢之推移、環境能容許彼侵略至何地步、則彼侵略之足跡、即追蹤至何地步、决不以從前宣示者爲滿足、惟環境非日本所能單獨造成、其責任實在於國聯自身、國聯之應付方法、目前又須視諸公報告爲轉移、是以我人於萬分沉痛、萬分失望之餘、不能不集中視綫於諸公、諸公應知、現在國際間含有無數危險之種子、遼東事變、縱可以徇從一强國之意旨、敷衍了結、而世界大戰之動機、或且由此加增速率、國聯威信、如因遼東一役、而完全被壞無餘、勢必舉全世界十五萬萬生命以殉之、凡在人類、當不忍見此慘禍、故敝會所望於諸公者、惟求此行能得一詳確之報告、公平之紀述、使轲聯爲最後之措置而已、前途珍重、行矣勉之、</p>

<h3>委員會公開會議</h3>
<p>顏代表反對吳市長函中之規約</p>
<p>希孟亦認該約係一種政治條件</p>
<p>結果日代表允保留待後日會議</p>
<p>撤兵談判委員會未便直接參預</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯議會委員、今日討論上海時局、歷兩時半、甚注意和平談判、尤注意於日本對於一月二十八日上海吳市長一函之規約、此種規約、言及抵制日貨及組織共同委員會、加入中立國人、以監視日軍撤退境内之狀况事、顏博士反對此規約、以爲共同委員會、乃中日合組的團體之謂、若業已撤退之侵犯者、復來監視當地一般狀况、此乃不可忍受之事、委員會未許討論抵制事、但衆意監視撤兵之委員會、不應全以中立國人組成之、再議會委員會、不欲支配在滬進行之談判、但如有人報告議會、指上海所爲者、與議會議案抵觸、則議會委員會、可干涉之、會塲中表示此種意見、並請中日代表將此意見、轉達雙方政府後、委員會遂散會、關於中日爭執之各事、現將交國聯秘書處辦理之、但若有嚴重發展、則議會委員會、可立即召集開會、法代表彭古贊成議長希孟之意見、希孟以爲議會議案、並未有監視上海日兵撤退之委員會、應純以中立國人組成之意、原議案文中、「予以襄助」之一語、含有中日合組委員會·於需要時、可請其襄助之意、希孟又以爲日本對於吳市長函之規約、乃政治性質、故應屬於圓桌會議之範圍、彭古對此見解、甚以爲然、日代表答顏博士、及其他發言人之言論、否認最近十日間、仍無趨向永遠解决之任何進步、其錯在於日本之說、謂日本自三月四日至三月十四日等候中代表之派出、以便與日代表討論條件、中代表反對共同委員會監視撤兵一節、渠可以希孟之言語答覆之、至於上海吳市長來函一事、渠切實聲明、日本對於經濟問題之重視、佐藤同時聲明、渠提出此點、並非作爲條件、祗希望兩國間之關係、得因此較趨平穩、如中國政府對此點認爲不能接受、日方應保留嗣後會議時提出此點之全權、佐藤末稱、渠盼議會委員會、能發表聲明書、解說關於上海進行之談判、擬如何合作、佐藤問委員會願否頒發訓令、隨時指導參預談判之代表、瑞士代表摩太稱、渠對於希孟及彭古之意見、極表贊同、并謂渠聆佐藤關於吳市長函之聲明後、認爲各方意見、似已趨於一致、關於議會委員會所應處之地位、因事勢關係、該委員會對於上海談判之細節、未獲直接參預及支配、委員會之地位、應較爲簡單、如委員會接有違反國聯議案舉動之報告、則應切實聲明之云、希孟又言及議會委員會之職權、謂委員係國聯之代表、其責任在視察議會議案之適當履行、而不在監視當地談判、亦不在提出休戰條件、惟被請求時、始干涉之、尙請中日代表將委員會此種見解、轉達雙方政府云、至此會衆議定散會、而由國聯秘書處接洽遠東事件、如發生重要事件、秘書處得立即召集議會委員會之會議、但議長希孟、以爲不必因較小問題、採行此嚴重步驟顏博士對於委員會所表示之意見、及日代表對此意思之接受、表示謝意、謂渠將立即電達政府、以銷除其對於日本規約之焦慮、又謂現宜糾正上海會議將討論抵制之印象、實則上海會議、將討論上海外人安全及其他地方問題耳、抵制乃全國問題、俟日軍撤退與友誼恢復後、抵制自然終止而銷滅於無形云、希孟禁止委員會討論抵制之嚴重問題、渠謂關於解决中日爭端所應提出之一切問題、上海會議時、自當詳細討論、不容遺漏云云、佐藤謂渠個人希望該會議能使抵貨運動永不發生、惟關於休戰條件、日政府之態度如何、渠尙未得確訊、故應充分保留、希孟答稱、上海會議時、雙方政府固有充分自由、提出任何問題云、委員會旋即停止公開會議、而接開非公開會議、</p>
<p>（日内瓦）議長希孟在國聯議會委員會第一次公開會議中、宣讀中國來電原文、内言在英公使藍溥森茶會時草擬之辦法、即㈠華軍駐於現有地位、以待日後之解决、㈡日軍退入公共租界·及從虹口區域中租界外之路退去、惟日軍數衆、有一部份可暫駐於與上述地點毘連之地段、㈢有中立國人在内之共同委員會、監視雙方撤兵是、希孟稱、渠未見日本修正案與第三段有多大不同之點、且划擬辦法、末有「現知未有其他原則問題提出」一語、日本修正文旣不穩健、且與議會議案抵觸、况共同委員會僅監視撤兵狀况、與秩序安全問題、並不涉及原則問題云、希孟對於吳市長之函、表示意見、以爲日本之規約、係一種政治條件、故與議會議案相抵觸云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>委員會非公開會議</h3>
<p>决請雙方報告履行議案之步驟</p>
<p>多數委員認上海問題應先解决</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯議會委員會、於非公開會、議時、所討論者多涉及中國代表團送來之覺書、該覺書指明關於履行議會三月四日之决議案·以及行政會去年九月三十日及十二月十日之兩决議案、議會委員會應負種種之責任、且謂日本似藉口議員三月四日之議案、脅迫中國接受一哀的美敦書、故中國建議、委員會應向兩方政府聲明、三月四日决議案所包括者、究竟爲何關於行政會所通過之議案、華代表擬請議會委員會、請求兩當事國報告、各已採取何種步驟、履行是項議案、并限定此項報告、應於復活節後、委員會首次開會前送到、此外華代表之覺書、尙請國聯調查團、從速報告、日方履行其依照行政會議案之各義務、究達若何程度、該覺書最後聲明、國聯之嚴密監視、爲制止日方於上海及東省侵略行爲之最良方法、委員會討論時間、歷一時三刻、旋决請中日兩政府各具聲明書、報告各方關於履行行政會九月三十日及十二月十日兩議案所採取之步驟、并决請國聯調查團、於可能範圍内、從速繕具關於滿洲情形之報告、非公開會議時、委員數人發表意見、謂滿洲撤兵問題、較諸上海撤兵問題更爲重要、西班牙代表稱、委員會應請國聯調查團、報告滿洲新政府問題、說明其如何創立、以及民衆對之有何表示、但此提案、未獲通過、因多數委員認爲上海問題、應先行解决、且此項調查報告、將使上海問題更趨複雜、關於華代表覺書内所提出之其他各點、則認爲委員會前所採取之行動、已包括無遺矣、（十七日路透電）　　（日内瓦）今日十九國委員會舉行非公開會議、對於滿洲問題、雖有詳盡之討論、主席希孟氏於會議完畢後、宣稱該委員會决定對於中日問題之現狀、應先與各國代表各具一報告書、詳述各國對於九月三十日及十二月十日各議案通過後所發生之事態意見如何、以便委員會統籌大局後、再作一總報告、呈諸國聯大會、再十九國委員會復通過議决案請求國聯理事會會長轉達國聯滿洲調查團主席李頓勳爵、使作一報告書、規畫依照三月十日决議案、使日本在滿洲撤兵之方案、今日之會議、尤有一重要件可以陳述者、即十九國委員會已一致贊同承認滿洲問題與上海事件爲連屬不可判分之事項、故其解决、必須俟中日問題之全部得能整理後、始有希望、十九國委員會今日開會之時、爲下午三點三十八分、舉行公開會議、主席希孟氏首先報告上海戰事、告一結束、日本代表佐藤稱日軍正在陸續撤退之中、中國代表顏惠慶氏、繼續發言</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>、對於本星期初藍浦森郭泰祺電光葵茶話會所討論之和平草案、及日本所主張之修改案、均有所論列、顏氏稱草案第三節原文、關於雙方軍隊互相撤退證明一節、經日本修改之後、不啻將中立區域之主張、重新加入、故中國方面、難與承認、因此將等於對於日本之撤兵、加以政治條件也、佐藤系謂此種休戰協議、係秘密性質、顏氏答辯、此係何種秘密、吾實毫無所聞、顏氏繼謂日本旣尙要求中國排日風潮之停止、此問題中國無承認之可能、因休戰係軍事問題、不得牽涉及政治問題也、藤佐氏繼稱、倘委員會欲監督或管理交涉之進行、此實超乎委員會法權能力之外、於是主席希孟氏即稱、委員會之工作、不在命令休戰條件、但委員會必須監視雙方尊重大會之决議案、故應請中日代表對於此點、應通知其政府而請注意、顏惠慶繼對希孟氏之言、表示感謝、因委員會之眞正事權、益以明顯也、再則日本所提出之修改案、不得委員會之贊助、尤可欣慰云、顏氏謂排貨之事、係一種民衆運動、旣已普遍於中國之全部、并非如日人所宣傳、可以政府管理者也、他日日軍退出中國領域之時、排貨風潮、可以自然消滅云、希孟氏稱委員會之職務、與排斥日貨事無關、日本代表佐藤氏、則謂事雖無關、然欲上海和議能使該項風潮早歸正寢云、委員會遂於下午五時五十九分散會、（十七日國民社電）</p>
<h3>英報紀佐藤代表談片</h3>
<p>上海第一幕殆已終止</p>
<p>滿案問題則困難尙多</p>
<p>倫敦紀事報今日以問答體載國聯日總代表佐藤在日内瓦之談片、其言中曾將上海滿洲大作區别、訪員問曰、貴政府對於耀武揚威之結果、其滿意乎、軍事經營之成就、其如預望乎、佐藤以簡語作答曰、事變已向所未前料之方面發展矣、訪員乃發表意見、謂日本現切欲將其上海之損失、置之不顧、而擬在滿洲繼續進行其政策、佐藤對於此言、未加否認、而曰上海或名之曰第一幕、殆已終止、然余恐滿案尙多困難也、佐藤續謂日本依法律手續所得滿洲之讓予權、理當使之照約履行、日本將以十年之功、在滿奠定秩序安寗、而令繁榮大見擴張、日本對於其善意的擴張、不欲容許國聯在滿有所干涉也、訪員又曰、佐藤可謂已盡人力所能爲、爲胡行之國家效勞、其爲人富於忍耐、殊覺可敬、苟不讀其勇敢之言詞、則不免令人覺其爲一負重累之外交家、方處於前途茫茫毫無把握中也（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>日政府停戰訓令内容</h3>
<p>路透社十八日東京電、日政府已以關於休戰建議之最後訓令、政重光葵、聞日政府表明、願照昨日國聯議會十九人委員員所宣讀之中國電報中規定之三點辦理、即㈠華軍仍留於現居地位、以待日後之解决、㈡日軍退入公共租界、及由虹口區域租界外之路退去、㈢有中立國人在内之共同委員會監視撤兵及退出區域内之行政、聞日政府並訓令重光葵、切實申明休戰協定、乃預先假定、召集圓桌會議、而應在日軍完全撤退以前討論抵制日貨及日僑生命財產安全問題、</p>
<h3>日無誠意停戰</h3>
<p>又有主張設立中立區說</p>
<p>調查團參加和議亦打銷</p>
<p>上海停戰會議、自星期一成立基本原則後、中日雙方預定星期三在英總領事館舉行正式會議、嗣日方以東京訓令未到、遂臨時作罷、日人方面消息、東京訓令現已到滬、聞又主設立中立區、惟我外交當局尙未接得正式通加、中日代表昨日因未會見、昨晚日使重光葵訪英使藍溥森、大約已將東京新訓令之内容、通知英藍使轉達我方、至於國聯調查團參加和議問題、昨晚據李頓左右宣稱、日内瓦方面、對此仍無訓令、大約已無形打銷矣、</p>
<h3>郭泰祺談停戰會議經過</h3>
<p>日以未奉訓令爲辭</p>
<p>致會議延未得舉行</p>
<p>日來外間對於本埠和議之進行、傳說紛紶莫明眞相、記者因此事關係至大、易滋誤會、乃於本日往謁外交次長郭泰祺氏、詢問和議進行經過情形、當承郭氏接見、并答覆如下、郭氏謂、自本月九十兩日中日雙方、關於停戰會議問題、以書面聲明意見後、（均由英使轉達）和議已成僵局、英美法三使及義代辦、均以書面交換意見、遷延時日、而目前僵局、亦須及早打開、因此於十四日下午、在英領署開一茶會、邀余與日使重光列席、（此爲余與重光第二次會晤、第一次則在旬餘日以前、亦係在英領署應英使茶會之約、）各方遂作一長時間非正式交換意見、結果、得到對於停戰會議議程之基本原則數條、即顏代表在日内瓦所發表者是也、彼時雙方約定請示政府、我方早得南京政府訓令、其意見亦經顏代表在日内瓦披露、惟日使則始終以未奉到東京訓令爲辭、以致原定星期三下午四時開正式會議、决定停戰會議議程之約、未能舉行、迄於現時止、日方尙無消息、尙有一節、外間亟須明瞭者、即係目前吾人所進行之會議、除中·日·兩方外、英·美·法·三國公使義代辦及各方軍事代表、亦均將參預、其所議事項、僅以有關係停戰及撤兵事件爲限、完全係根據國聯議會議决案、凡有關於政治性質之問題、槪不列入、與外間所傳之圓桌會議、或上海會議、截然兩事云云、</p>
<h3>日兵來多去少</h3>
<p>調回一萬六千</p>
<p>運來不下三萬</p>
<p>日本此次在上海作戰之兵、最先調來者、爲久留米之第二十四混成旅團、該旅團備齊步騎砲工兵、全額約有八千餘人、在江灣閘北、與我十九路軍作戰、迭遭潰敗、損害最重、此次奉令撤調歸國、當眞茹撤回時、曾開陣亡官兵追悼會、可見受創之重、昨已開始調防歸國、情形分述如下、</p>
<h3>廿四旅團集中</h3>
<p>第二十四旅團步到吳淞張華浜鐵路碼頭取齊、軍械大砲輜重等項、有一部分、在前兩天、已經裝運輸船、先行載去一批、至昨日下午三時、全旅官兵、已完全開到碼頭、日本陸軍省已派運輸輪兩艘來滬、裝載該旅返日、從三時起、開始登輪、</p>
<h3>兩輪運送歸國</h3>
<p>二十四旅旅團長爲下元少將、昨日午後三時起、分令所部上運輸輪ＲｙｏｋａｉＭａｒｕ、ＳｈｉｏｋｕＭａｒｕ兩艘、軍械在砲子彈等項、則用吊車吊入船内、全旅上輪官兵、尙有六千名、直至下午五時許、方始上齊、滬上日僑等到張華浜碼頭送行者頗多、至六時運裝已竣、隨即啓椗開行、出吳淞口、逕赴門司、</p>
<h3>十一師團退淞</h3>
<p>第十一師團亦奉至開拔歸國之命、該師團之在瀏河嘉定等處步兵、現向羅店集中、其騎砲等隊之在前方、亦已奉得退到吳淞之命、昨已有大批卡車、運載該軍及械彈等、到張華浜楊樹浦兩地、準備開還日本、聞該師團因重砲等轉運較難、至速須一星期、方能運畢、而第一批之撤退兵士、已定二十一日起、開始在張華浜上船、</p>
<h3>補充新兵到滬</h3>
<p>此次撤退一師一旅團陸軍、共計兵額一萬六千名、而陸續派來接防之十四師圑部隊、因照戰時編制、連補充隊不下二萬名、業已先後運到前方、昨復由運送船福朗特丸、載到補充兵一隊、另有十五隊及廿六隊驅逐艦各一艘、隨行到滬、此項兵士、均係十四師團補充兵士、當即派往接代十一師團防區、故撤回之兵額、不若調來之多也、</p>
<p>日軍仍在備戰</p>
<h3>浮橋一帶日增兵</h3>
<p>崑山十八日專電云、日偵機一架、於十八晨十時、在蘇崑一帶盤旋、飛行極低、歷一小時、始飛向滬去、楊家橋浮橋婁塘三處日軍、自十六起、紛紛調防、並在各陣地增添兵額、</p>
<h3>大隊日軍開嘉定</h3>
<p>日軍第九師團大隊、十三日自南翔開駐嘉定城中、中有高麗白俄人、城中原駐日軍、由好辦社長谷川貞三郎、率赴嘉定瀏河間之徐行鎭、四城僅有南門許居民出入、袁司徒方面之敵壕、長三里餘、深可丈許、附近民房、日軍搜查後、於門户懸太陽旗、</p>
<h3>虹口裝軍用電話</h3>
<p>遠東社云、日軍前日起、在狄司威路及虹口一帶、裝製軍用電話、昨日尤爲忙碌、</p>
<p>日僑狡辯暴行</p>
<h3>答基督徒之詢問</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、日前抵滬之日本基督敎士及西敎士八人、昨（十七）日下午訪問日本人俱樂部、由本埠日僑要人招待、談話之際、各敎士首詢日軍、轟燬商務印書館及其他文化機關原因、次詢日僑非法行動之故、日僑發言人答辭、頗爲奇妙、聲稱、商務印書館不僅爲排日宣傳之中心、且當衝突之時、爲閘北軍隊主要防禦地、即如轟擊日兵、而誤落租界之砲彈、亦多由北方面發出、又稱、轟燬各大學、學敎育機關之原由、因自國民黨柄政後、中國敎育已失敎育眞意、變爲政治宣傳之工具、至於未嘗用作軍事行動之敎育機關、日軍並未加以殘毁、如復旦大學、即其一例、至虹口日僑之非法行動、則稱爲自衛上發生之偶然事故、在搜查虹口大旅社以前、中國便衣隊幾使虹口成爲恐怖世界、日僑幾乎到處有被射擊之虞、故取自衛手段、日僑中固未免有若干浪人、但一經日當道聞知、立即取締、已有一百人遞解回國、即攻擊三友工廠者、亦有數人解回本國云、（譯者按日人此種飾辭辯護、吾國亟宜有以聲明事實以昭眞相、故爲譯誌大略、）</p>
<p>日本對外貿易入超</p>
<h3>一二兩月九千三百萬元</h3>
<p>駐滬日本商務參事官事務所、接十六日東京電云、二月份日本對外貿易、因原棉小麥豆鐵入口增加、生絲出口呆滯、故入超達四千七百萬日金、是月入口貿易總額達一萬二千八百萬元、出口爲八千萬元、與上年同月比較、入口增二千九百萬元、出口減一千萬元、本年一二兩月入超、共達九千三百萬元、較之上年同一時期、入超增多八千七百萬元、二月份對華貿易、因中國時局不靖、出口貨大受打擊、其總額爲一千一百萬元、較之上月減少一千萬元、等於百分之四十八、入口總額則爲二千一百萬元、較之上月增百分之七、兩比結果爲入超一千萬元、就各地分别觀察、與上年同月比較、計關東租借地增百分之三十五、滿洲減百分之三十五、華南減百分之九十四、華中減百分之八十七、香港減百分之六十八、華北減百分之三十二、</p>

<h3>A Precedent for the Success of the League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Some days ago, Sir Lytton attended a banquet hosted by Guo Taiqi, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. During the banquet, he remarked, "The League of Nations has been established for ten years. It has encountered crises more than once, but it has always managed to eliminate them without failure. Considering the past achievements, I deeply believe that the current incident will be resolved satisfactorily." These few words overflowed with confidence and a sense of responsibility. What more can we say besides hoping that he fulfills his responsibilities and completes his self-assurance? When we consider what Sir Lytton referred to as past achievements, the most notable is probably the incident of the Bush dispute in 1925.</p>
<p>It is recorded that on October 22, 1925, the Greek army launched a large-scale invasion of Bulgaria, occupying Bulgaria's border. The Bulgarian government urgently telegraphed Geneva, requesting the convening of the Council, citing Articles 10 and 11 of the Covenant. The first step taken by the Council after its meeting was to find ways to stop the hostile acts. The second step was to order Greece to withdraw its troops. The results were all as the League of Nations wished. At that time, Chairman Briand's mediation was particularly diligent, severely condemning countries that violated the Covenant, using the name of self-defense to carry out aggression. The Council also resolved to organize an investigation team, with its tasks roughly divided into three points: first, to investigate the facts and determine responsibility; second, to stipulate compensation; and third, to suggest methods for resolving the dispute. Briand believed that this incident could follow the proper path of the League of Nations and proceed smoothly, and he considered it a model. British Foreign Secretary Chamberlain further believed that this incident could serve as a model for any member state. At that time, the first to support Chamberlain's statement was the Japanese representative, Adachi.</p>
<p>The result of the investigation team's work confirmed that Greece's occupation of Bulgarian territory was a violation of the Covenant. No excuse could cover up this act of aggression, and the responsibility for compensation rested with Greece. Looking at the whole case, from beginning to end, it was based on the Covenant and resolved quickly. The work of the investigation team was very effective. When the investigation team completed its work, the Council specifically organized a review committee, and the chairman was the Japanese representative, Adachi. His review report was particularly righteous and stern, stating: "Invading the land of a neighboring country, even if forced by some circumstances, cannot cover up the fact of violating the agreement and attempting to evade the responsibility for compensation. We believe that this is the highest principle and must be approved by the entire Council." This is truly one of the most glorious pages in the League of Nations' resolution of disputes. At that time, not only did Briand and his colleagues uphold justice and refuse to yield, but the Japanese representative also knew the dignity of the League of Nations Charter and had an appearance of inviolability. But looking back at today's Sino-Japanese dispute, what is it like? Since the incident in the Northeast last year, it has been delayed for half a year. Japan has abandoned the Covenant, and the area of its aggression against Chinese territory exceeds that of any major Western European country. Its influence is enough to affect world peace. Can the League of Nations adjudicate this matter with the same adherence to fairness as in the past, and not be threatened by powerful countries? Let's not talk about the achievements before this matter. Can the future progress save the previous stagnation and follow the glory of resolving the Bush dispute?</p>
<p>If the members of the investigation team truly want to "resolve the current incident satisfactorily" and follow the glory of resolving the Bush dispute, then please read the recent candid words of Sir Cecil. Sir Cecil said: "If the future resolution does not punish improper aggression, does not refute militaristic policies, and does not guarantee that loyal members of the League of Nations receive compensation for the harm they have suffered, it will inflict a damaging blow on international morality." Sir Cecil's words, assessed against the new international morality after the Great War, are by no means an overstatement. The Bush dispute has become a precedent. We only hope that the investigation team will work hard to preserve its credibility. In his response to the representatives of the universities yesterday, Sir Lytton hoped that "member states would maintain peace with consistency between their words and deeds." Now, considering the words of Representative Adachi and the actions of Japan itself, isn't Japan the country with the most inconsistency between its words and deeds? If this inconsistency between words and deeds continues, the future of the investigation team's work will be full of thorns. We cannot help but worry about the future of the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team Begins Investigation</h3>
<p>Met with Key Japanese Officials Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Decided to Visit the Battlefield on the 21st</p>
<p>Attended a Banquet Hosted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Last Night at 8 PM</p>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day since the League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Shanghai. Because of investigating the Shanghai incident and collecting materials, they had no free time. They had to decline the banquet scheduled for yesterday afternoon by academic groups and others. Around 10 AM, they met with Matsuoka Yosuke, the representative of Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa, and Japanese Naval Commander Nomura. Around 8 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It is heard that the team plans to visit the battlefield in the Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei areas on the 21st and leave Shanghai on the 26th. The Beijing government has already drafted an itinerary for the team's reception. Details are recorded below.</p>

During the banquet, the chairman delivered a welcome speech, and Sir Lytton responded on behalf of the team. The event ended at 10:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</h3>
<p>"The gentlemen of the League of Nations Investigation Team have come to our country despite the unprecedented state of emergency, and we are extremely honored to be able to express our sincere welcome. The League of Nations has only been established for a little over a decade, and considering the international disputes it has handled, although it cannot be said to have fully exercised its authority, it has achieved considerable results, making countries generally aware that there are paths to resolve disputes other than military force. Therefore, our long-held feeling is that the League of Nations has already achieved considerable success, and the international community has entered a new era. Unfortunately, on September 18th of last year, the Japanese army suddenly occupied Shenyang, and shortly after, on November 18th, they occupied Heilongjiang. On January 3rd of this year, they occupied Jinzhou, and on January 28th, they attacked Zhabei with their naval landing forces, carrying out destruction and burning in various places. On March 1st, they occupied Liuhe, 70 miles from Shanghai. On the same day, the puppet government of Manchuria, which they manufactured, was declared established in Changchun. All the League of Nations Covenant, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact were destroyed. Every time the League of Nations held a meeting, the Japanese army's atrocities in China progressed once. This kind of action directly threatens the entire world and indirectly threatens the League of Nations. Therefore, the League of Nations has encountered unprecedented difficulties since its establishment, and the handling is extremely difficult. Therefore, the League of Nations Investigation Team was dispatched. You gentlemen, entrusted by the League of Nations, have come to China in succession. In essence, whether the Far Eastern Incident can be eliminated and whether world peace can be preserved rests on the shoulders of the League of Nations, and whether the League of Nations can handle it perfectly depends on your investigation report. Therefore, your visit is tantamount to entrusting the future life of the League of Nations to your shoulders. The importance of the task is beyond what ordinary words can describe. According to the League of Nations' decision at the time of dispatching the investigation team, the main focus was on the Manchurian Incident. Although the Shanghai War broke out while you were en route, and the incident became more widespread, the Japanese disturbance in the Southeast was intended to consolidate their seized territory in the Northeast. Therefore, the Shanghai incident should still be categorized under the Northeast Incident. After you gentlemen came to China, there was no Chinese agency in the three northeastern provinces that could freely exercise its political power. There were no Chinese officials to interview, and there were no public records to refer to. Our Chamber dares to assert that the information you gentlemen obtained from the three northeastern provinces must have been modified by the Japanese or produced by the Japanese. Therefore, our Chamber believes that in order to clarify the truth of the facts, it is essential for you gentlemen to sincerely listen to the narratives of various Chinese public and private organizations outside the three northeastern provinces. We venture to summarize them into three major points for your consideration. The reason why the Japanese suddenly used force and occupied the three northeastern provinces this time was nothing more than the excuse that China does not respect treaties and that outstanding issues have been delayed without resolution, causing their soldiers to be unable to wait quietly and forced to take independent action. This can be confirmed by the fact that after the Japanese troops occupied Shenyang, the Japanese cabinet began to hold cabinet meetings to retroactively approve their actions. The Japanese often criticize China as a country that does not conform to modern organization. May I ask, can a country where soldiers act independently abroad and are not commanded by their government be considered a country that conforms to modernity? This point is considered irrelevant and will not be discussed in depth. The biggest reason for their criticism of China is first, the lack of respect for treaties. According to our Chamber's observation, it is Japan, not China, that often does not respect treaties. This can be proven by numerous instances. Today, Japan is brewing a rare deterioration in Sino-foreign diplomatic history in the three northeastern provinces, all because of 1) the establishment of the so-called South Manchuria Railway Garrison; 2) the establishment of the so-called South Manchuria Railway附属地 (Affiliated Areas); and 3) the establishment of Japanese police in the Liaoning and Jilin provinces. These will be analyzed in detail one by one. The right to establish a garrison for the South Manchuria Railway was originally based on the precedent of the Russians in the Chinese Eastern Railway. After the Russo-Japanese peace negotiations, Japan signed a treaty with China, stipulating that once the Russians withdrew their Chinese Eastern Railway Garrison, Japan would simultaneously withdraw theirs. However, the Russian Chinese Eastern Railway Garrison withdrew as early as 1918, while the Japanese army has been stationed in the South Manchuria Railway as before. In this respect, is it Japan that does not respect treaties, or is it China that does not respect treaties? Secondly, the so-called South Manchuria Railway 附属地 (Affiliated Areas), according to the Chinese-Russian contract for the Chinese Eastern Railway, only has the right to exempt railway land from land rent, with no other provisions. The General Outline for Handling Affairs of the Harbin Municipal Council, agreed upon by China and Russia in 1909, clearly recognized that the right to govern railway land belongs to China. As for the East Three Provinces Post-War Treaty signed between China and Japan, there are no provisions at all regarding the so-called South Manchuria Railway 附属地 (Affiliated Areas). However, Japan regards the South Manchuria Railway as an extension of the Kwantung Leased Territory, seizing all three powers of administration, justice, and judiciary. In this respect, is it Japan that does not respect treaties, or is it China that does not respect treaties? Japanese police are stationed everywhere in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. In 1916, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs investigated and stated that there were only seven counties in Liaoning Province where there were no Japanese troops. When the Zhengjiatun incident was resolved, they were ordered to withdraw according to the treaty. Although the Japanese have no basis to rely on, the areas where police are stationed remain as before. In this respect, is it Japan that does not respect treaties, or is it China that does not respect treaties? The biggest reason for their criticism of China is second, the delayed resolution of outstanding issues. This can be explained in the following three points: 1) The delayed resolution of outstanding issues is common in international relations. Even in China's case, there are cases with other countries that have not been resolved for a long time. However, to resort to military occupation without resorting to diplomatic means is a blatant act of contempt for international covenants. 2) According to the announcement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are dozens of cases that China has submitted to Japan for negotiation but Japan has delayed in resolving. If China were to take the same actions as Japan, would Japan accept it? 3) Japan's independent actions in the three northeastern provinces, such as the reconstruction of the Anfeng Railway to a wider gauge and the forceful occupation of Chinese people's land by Korean farmers, are all protected by military police, constituting de facto progress. Therefore, the delayed resolution of outstanding issues benefits Japan and causes suffering to China. China has never had the intention to delay the resolution of outstanding issues. The reason for the delay is due to the machinations of the Japanese, who want to deal with local governments and are unwilling to involve the central government, resulting in a deadlock. The biggest reason for their criticism of China is third, the so-called railway parallel line issue. This can also be explained in the following four points: (1) The East Three Provinces Post-War Treaty signed between China and Japan only recognizes Japan's inheritance of the rights to the South Manchuria Railway ceded by Russia. The issue of parallel lines was not mentioned in the treaty. Subsequently, there were only notes exchanged between the ministers of the two countries for discussion, which were not approved by the government and cannot be used as a basis. This point is also recognized by Japanese scholars. (2) Even according to the notes exchanged between the ministers of the two countries, the distance of the parallel lines is based on the standards of the Zhengtai Railway built with Russian loans. The Datong-Shenhai lines built by China are more than 300 li away from the South Manchuria line, and there is absolutely no possibility of a parallel line dispute. (3) When the authorities of the three eastern provinces borrowed money from Japan for the Tao'ang Railway, the Japanese claimed that the section belonged to the scope of northern Manchuria. Having obtained the benefit of this loan, they voluntarily disregarded the dispute over the Datong-Shenhai-Jihai lines. How can they use it as an excuse in the future? (4) The new railways built by China in the eastern provinces have not actually threatened the survival of the South Manchuria Railway. There is a statement by the president of the railway that can be referred to. When Japan first appointed Uchida Kosai as president, its original intention was to use diplomatic means to gradually resolve the issue. However, the country's soldiers used this as a launching pad. Therefore, based on the above facts, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) The so-called infringement of China's rights in the three northeastern provinces by Japan is mostly exaggerated and absolutely contrary to the facts. (2) It is an unforgivable crime according to the League of Nations Covenant to not resort to diplomatic means to resolve disputes but to allow soldiers to engage in unlimited military expansion and freely seize the territory of neighboring countries. One more point that we should pay attention to is that after initially occupying Liaoning and Jilin, the Japanese still claimed that once the lives and properties of their nationals could be ensured, they would withdraw their troops. They still did not dare to openly recognize the three northeastern provinces as their territory. They advocated that they would never withdraw their troops. Later, seeing that the occupation of Heilongjiang and the occupation of Jinzhou were not sanctioned by the League of Nations, the puppet state they manufactured openly appeared, and its so-called pseudo-national assembly was held. Japanese consuls and officials from the Kwantung Leased Territory attended, and military personnel also visited frequently to express their views. In the past, it was said that Japanese officials did not participate in the establishment of this stealing government. What excuses do they have to defend themselves now? In the past, although they were unwilling to withdraw their troops, they did not dare to openly say that they would not withdraw their troops. Now, Japan is advocating the transfer of three or five divisions from the mainland to Manchuria to serve as the national defense of the pseudo-state. Do you gentlemen still believe in Japan's repeated declarations to the world? We dare to say that Japan's aggression against China has no fixed limit. They only observe the development of the situation and how much the environment can allow them to invade, and they will follow the footsteps of aggression to that extent. They will never be satisfied with what they have declared in the past. However, the environment cannot be created by Japan alone. The responsibility lies with the League of Nations itself. The League of Nations' response method currently depends on your report. Therefore, after extreme grief and extreme disappointment, we cannot but focus our attention on you gentlemen. You should know that there are countless dangerous seeds in the international community. The Liaodong Incident can be concluded by accommodating the wishes of a powerful country, but the motives for a world war may be accelerated by this. If the credibility of the League of Nations is completely destroyed by the Liaodong campaign, it will inevitably sacrifice the lives of 1.5 billion people in the world. All human beings cannot bear to see this tragedy. Therefore, what our Chamber hopes from you gentlemen is that this trip can obtain a detailed report and a fair account, so that the League of Nations can make the final arrangements. Farewell and may your journey be fruitful."</p>
<h3>Sir Lytton's Response</h3>
<p>"We are very grateful to you gentlemen for your warm hospitality. The fact that your government has entrusted such an important issue to the League of Nations shows deep trust in the League of Nations, for which the League of Nations is very grateful. I dare to say that the final result will not disappoint China. The task of our colleagues on this trip is to investigate all the facts with an impartial attitude and report to the League of Nations, and to suggest to the League of Nations based on our observations. Gentlemen, you do not need to doubt that the League of Nations will be unfair. As for the methods of our colleagues, the first step is to help China and Japan to have room for negotiation, because the two sides are currently too far apart. If the first step is difficult to achieve, then the final solution will still depend on the League of Nations. However, one word must be solemnly stated, that is, before the League of Nations makes a judgment, we must accommodate the opinions of both sides as much as possible, so that China will not be harmed by trusting the League of Nations. The gentlemen sitting here tonight are all giants in the business community. My colleagues and I were entertained by the local Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo, and I said that if the current Sino-Japanese dispute were resolved by the fully authorized representatives of the two countries' businessmen, the result might be faster, more sensitive, and more satisfactory."</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Government Mayor Wu translates and forwards to the League of Nations Investigation Team: Since the violent Japanese invasion, the Northeast and Shanghai areas have suffered the same tragic disasters. Our country is a nation that loves peace and has always supported the League of Nations, which advocates justice and maintains peace. We have expressed our utmost sincerity and joy to your team, the messengers of peace, for coming to China. We hope that you will investigate everything with an impartial and fair attitude and spirit, so that the League of Nations can have a correct plan for the Sino-Japanese incident, and take effective sanctions against Japan, which is carrying out aggression, to comfort the souls of those who died in the front line for upholding peace, and to stop the fierce flames of those who violate the covenant and carry out aggression.

<p>Shanghai Municipal Government Mayor Wu translates and forwards to the League of Nations Investigation Team: East Asian peace and world peace have been completely destroyed by the aggressive Japanese invasionism. The League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty no longer exist in the minds of the Japanese. Therefore, they dared to attack and occupy the three northeastern provinces of our country on September 18 last year, and they resumed their gunboat policy in Shanghai, the world market, on January 28 this year. Our Chinese nation has engaged in self-defense resistance because it cannot bear it anymore. We firmly believe that the League of Nations will stand on the position of justice, fairness, and its own duties, and effectively sanction the Japanese atrocities in order to maintain the sacred covenant of the international community. Otherwise, our Chinese nation will only take self-defense measures and continue to resist and will never submit to violent oppression. All responsibilities for destroying world peace and destroying international covenants should be borne by Japan. It is hoped that your team will handle the matter fairly to stop the fierce flames of the violent Japanese and maintain world peace. Jiangsu Provincial Education Association Seal.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Government Mayor Wu translates and forwards to the League of Nations Investigation Team: We are overjoyed to hear that your team has arrived in Shanghai. Since the September 18 Incident in the three northeastern provinces last year, it has been more than half a year. The Japanese have disregarded international covenants and the League of Nations' repeated resolutions, forcibly occupied the Northeast, and delayed the withdrawal of troops. Recently, they have mobilized a large number of naval, land, and air forces to attack Shanghai, the economic center of our country, which is a large-scale and deliberate act of war. Our garrison has been forced to engage in self-defense resistance. This self-defense resistance is not only a necessary means for the Chinese nation to seek survival, but also a responsibility to uphold world justice and reason. We sincerely hope that your team will report the Japanese atrocities to the League of Nations in a spirit of peace and an attitude of fairness for effective judgment. This is not only the good fortune of our country, but also the good fortune of the future of world peace. Jiangsu Provincial Journalists Association Seal.</p>

<h3>Telegram from Various Circles in Chahar</h3>
<p>Telegram from various public organizations in Chahar to Shanghai, requesting forwarding to the League of Nations investigation team, stating: Your esteemed delegation has braved the hardship of a long journey to our humble country to investigate the Sino-Japanese dispute. Undeterred by difficulties, you uphold justice and strive for peace. Your noble spirit is truly admirable. We, the people of Chahar Province, as citizens of the Republic of China, wish to present a fair account to your delegation. According to China's request, the League of Nations Council passed two resolutions on September 30th and October 24th of last year, ordering Japan to withdraw its troops. The people of the world have witnessed and heard this, and it is clear to all. However, since September 18th of last year, Japan has used force to occupy Shenyang while the Chinese army was ordered to avoid resistance. Gradually, Jilin, Tongliao, Niuzhuang, Jinzhou, Heilongjiang, and Harbin have all been illegally seized. They disregard the sacred League of Nations. Moreover, they show no remorse and stubbornly pursue their own course. They invade by land and sea, advancing in the southeast, bombarding Wusong, setting fire to Zhabei, and wantonly destroying Shanghai, our commercial and cultural center and a world-renowned port. For months, the conflict has spread from the Northeast to the Southeast. The material and spiritual losses of our country amount to countless millions. Our defending forces in Shanghai were compelled to resist in self-defense, using their bodies as shields and flesh as bullets. Cherishing the determination to die, they won every battle. The past tolerance of the Shenyang Incident and the current resistance in the Shanghai Incident are both aimed at fighting for the survival of our great Chinese nation, for universal justice, and for the practical implementation of international covenants and League of Nations resolutions. We are informing your delegation that both China and Japan are members of the League of Nations and signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Japan is also bound by the Washington Nine-Power Treaty on the Far East and should respect peace and not use war as a means of resolving disputes, nor should it use force to undermine the independence and territorial integrity of other countries. There is no need for further discussion. However, while our country sincerely accepts and faithfully implements every League of Nations resolution, Japan disregards these resolutions and intensifies its aggression. Our people are deeply saddened. Recently, Japan has expanded its war zone, bombing undefended areas in Suzhou and Hangzhou. Moreover, under Japan's manipulation, Chinese traitors in the eastern provinces are actively establishing a puppet state. If the League of Nations does not impose effective sanctions, our people will have no choice but to continue the final path of self-defense and resistance, preferring to be shattered jade rather than preserved tile. Although this may cause turmoil in the world, those responsible will be held accountable. Your delegation must know that the League of Nations, at this most critical moment, whether from the standpoint of justice, principle, or its own responsibility, has a duty to punish Japan's atrocities and uphold the sacred covenant. For those who disrupt peace in East Asia are disrupting world peace, and conquering China is tantamount to conquering the world. If Japan's aims are achieved, it will regard the three eastern provinces as its lifeline today, and the Pacific and Indian Oceans as its lifeline tomorrow. Your delegation consists of world-renowned figures, and we earnestly express our heartfelt sentiments, hoping that you will carefully consider and adopt them. We would be most fortunate. Respectfully, the All-Province Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, Educational Association, Women's Progressive Association, various labor unions, various commercial and industrial associations, various schools, and student self-governing associations of Chahar, Republic of China.

<p>League of Nations Discusses Shanghai Situation</p>
<h3>Public Meeting of the Committee</h3>
<p>Representative Yan Opposes the Provisions in Mayor Wu's Letter</p>
<p>Hymans Also Believes the Agreement is a Political Condition</p>
<p>As a Result, the Japanese Representative Agrees to Reserve it for a Meeting in the Following Days</p>
<p>The Committee on Troop Withdrawal Negotiations is Not Suitable to Directly Participate</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council Committee discussed the Shanghai situation today for two and a half hours, paying close attention to the peace negotiations, especially to the regulations in the letter from Shanghai Mayor Wu to Japan on January 28th. These regulations refer to boycotting Japanese goods and organizing a joint committee with neutral parties to monitor the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the territory. Dr. Yan opposed this regulation, believing that the joint committee would be a Sino-Japanese joint organization. It is unacceptable for invaders who have already withdrawn to come back to monitor the general situation in the area. The committee did not allow discussion of the boycott issue, but the consensus was that the committee monitoring the withdrawal of troops should not be entirely composed of neutral parties. Furthermore, the Council Committee did not want to control the negotiations in Shanghai, but if someone reports to the Council that what is being done in Shanghai is in conflict with the Council's resolutions, then the Council Committee can intervene. This opinion was expressed in the meeting and the Chinese and Japanese representatives were asked to convey this opinion to their respective governments. The committee then adjourned. All matters regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute are now being handled by the League of Nations Secretariat, but if there are serious developments, the Council Committee can be convened immediately. French Representative Paul-Boncour agreed with President Hymans' opinion. Hymans believed that the Council's resolution did not imply that the committee monitoring the withdrawal of Japanese troops in Shanghai should be composed entirely of neutral parties. The phrase "to assist" in the original resolution implied that a Sino-Japanese joint committee could be formed and ask for assistance when needed. Hymans also believed that Japan's agreement to Mayor Wu's letter was political in nature and should therefore fall within the scope of the roundtable conference. Paul-Boncour strongly agreed with this view. The Japanese representative responded to the remarks of Dr. Yan and other speakers, denying that there had been any progress towards a permanent solution in the past ten days. He said that the fault lay with the Japanese side, saying that Japan had been waiting for the dispatch of a Chinese representative from March 4th to March 14th to discuss the conditions with the Japanese representative. The Chinese representative opposed the joint committee monitoring the withdrawal of troops, and he could reply to this with Hymans' words. As for the letter from Shanghai Mayor Wu, he firmly stated that Japan attached importance to economic issues. Sato also stated that he raised this point not as a condition, but only hoped that the relationship between the two countries would become more stable as a result. If the Chinese government believes that this point is unacceptable, the Japanese side should reserve the full power to raise this point at a later meeting. Sato concluded by saying that he hoped the Council Committee could issue a statement explaining how it intends to cooperate with the negotiations in Shanghai. Sato asked if the committee was willing to issue instructions to guide the representatives participating in the negotiations at any time. Swiss Representative Motta expressed his strong agreement with the opinions of Hymans and Paul-Boncour, and said that after listening to Sato's statement regarding Mayor Wu's letter, he believed that the opinions of all parties seemed to be converging. Regarding the position that the Council Committee should take, due to the circumstances, the committee did not directly participate in and control the details of the Shanghai negotiations. The committee's position should be simpler. If the committee receives reports of actions that violate the Council's resolutions, it should make a firm statement. Hymans also spoke about the powers of the Council Committee, saying that the committee members are representatives of the League of Nations and their responsibility is to inspect the proper implementation of the Council's resolutions, not to monitor the local negotiations, nor to propose ceasefire conditions, but to intervene only when requested. He also asked the Chinese and Japanese representatives to convey this view of the committee to their respective governments. At this point, the meeting voted to adjourn and the League of Nations Secretariat will follow up on the Far East incident. If a major incident occurs, the Secretariat may immediately convene a meeting of the Council Committee, but President Hymans believed that this serious step should not be taken for minor issues. Dr. Yan expressed his gratitude for the opinions expressed by the committee and the Japanese representative's acceptance of this meaning, saying that he would immediately telegraph his government to dispel his anxiety about the Japanese regulations. He also said that it is now appropriate to correct the impression that the Shanghai meeting will discuss the boycott, but in fact, the Shanghai meeting will discuss the safety of foreigners in Shanghai and other local issues. The boycott is a national issue, and after the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the restoration of friendship, the boycott will naturally end and disappear invisibly. Hymans prohibited the committee from discussing the serious issue of the boycott. He said that all issues that should be raised regarding the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute will be discussed in detail at the Shanghai meeting, without omission. Sato said that he personally hoped that the meeting would prevent the anti-Japanese goods movement from ever happening again, but he had not yet received confirmation of the Japanese government's attitude regarding the ceasefire conditions, so he should fully reserve his rights. Hymans replied that both governments had full freedom to raise any questions at the Shanghai meeting. The committee then adjourned the public meeting and proceeded to a non-public meeting.</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the first public meeting of the League of Nations Council Committee, President Hymans read out the original text of the telegram from China, which stated the measures drafted at the tea party of the British Minister Lambson, namely: 1) The Chinese army will be stationed in its current position pending future resolution; 2) The Japanese army will retreat into the Public Concession and withdraw from the roads outside the Concession in the Hongkou area, but a portion of the Japanese army may temporarily station in areas adjacent to the above-mentioned locations; 3) A joint committee including neutral parties will monitor the withdrawal of troops by both sides. Hymans said that he did not see much difference between the Japanese amendment and the third paragraph, and the drafted measures ended with the words "It is now known that no other principled issues have been raised." The Japanese amendment is not only unsound, but also conflicts with the Council's resolution, and the joint committee only monitors the withdrawal of troops and issues of order and security, and does not involve principled issues. Hymans expressed his opinion on Mayor Wu's letter, believing that the Japanese regulations were a political condition and therefore conflicted with the Council's resolution.

<h3>Non-Public Meeting of the Committee</h3>
<p>Decided to Ask Both Parties to Report on the Steps Taken to Implement the Resolution</p>
<p>Most Committee Members Believe that the Shanghai Issue Should be Resolved First</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the non-public meeting of the League of Nations Council Committee, the discussions mostly involved the memorandum sent by the Chinese delegation, which specified the various responsibilities that the Council Committee should bear regarding the implementation of the Council's resolution of March 4th and the two resolutions of the Administrative Council on September 30th and December 10th of last year. It also stated that Japan seemed to be using the Councilors' resolution of March 4th as an excuse to coerce China into accepting a "Diktat," so China suggested that the committee should declare to both governments what the resolution of March 4th included. Regarding the resolutions passed by the Administrative Council, the Chinese representative proposed that the Council Committee request the two parties concerned to report what steps they had taken to implement these resolutions, and limit this report to be delivered before the first meeting of the committee after Easter. In addition, the Chinese representative's memorandum also requested the League of Nations investigation team to report as soon as possible on the extent to which Japan has fulfilled its obligations under the Administrative Council's resolution. The memorandum finally stated that close monitoring by the League of Nations is the best way to prevent Japanese aggression in Shanghai and the eastern provinces. The committee discussed for an hour and a half, and then decided to ask the Chinese and Japanese governments to submit statements reporting on the steps taken by each party to implement the two resolutions of the Administrative Council on September 30th and December 10th, and decided to ask the League of Nations investigation team to prepare a report on the situation in Manchuria as soon as possible within its capacity. At the non-public meeting, several committee members expressed their opinions, saying that the issue of troop withdrawal in Manchuria was more important than the issue of troop withdrawal in Shanghai. The Spanish representative said that the committee should ask the League of Nations investigation team to report on the issue of the new government in Manchuria, explaining how it was established and what the public's reaction was to it, but this proposal was not adopted because most committee members believed that the Shanghai issue should be resolved first, and this investigation report would further complicate the Shanghai issue. Regarding the other points raised in the Chinese representative's memorandum, it was believed that the committee's previous actions had covered them all. (Reuters telegram on the 17th) (Geneva) The 19-member committee held a non-public meeting today. Although there was a detailed discussion on the Manchurian issue, Chairman Hymans declared after the meeting that the committee decided to first ask the representatives of each country to submit a report detailing the views of each country on the events that occurred after the passage of the resolutions of September 30th and December 10th, so that the committee could make a comprehensive report to the League of Nations General Assembly after comprehensively assessing the overall situation. The 19-member committee also passed a resolution requesting the President of the League of Nations Council to convey to Lord Lytton, Chairman of the League of Nations Manchurian Investigation Team, to make a report outlining the plan for Japan's troop withdrawal in Manchuria in accordance with the resolution of March 10th. Another important point that can be stated at today's meeting is that the 19-member committee has unanimously agreed to recognize the Manchurian issue and the Shanghai incident as related and inseparable matters, so their resolution must wait until all Sino-Japanese issues can be resolved. When the 19-member committee convened today, it was at 3:38 pm. At the public meeting, Chairman Hymans first reported on the end of the Shanghai war. Japanese Representative Sato stated that the Japanese army was gradually withdrawing. Chinese Representative Yen Hui-ching continued to speak</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>, concerning the peace draft discussed at the Lambson-Kuo Tai-chi tea party with Shigemitsu Koki at the beginning of this week, and the amendments proposed by Japan. Mr. Yen said that the original text of the third section of the draft, concerning the mutual withdrawal of troops by both sides, had been re-added to the assertion of a neutral zone after being amended by Japan, so it was difficult for the Chinese side to agree to it, as this would be equivalent to imposing political conditions on Japan's withdrawal. Sato said that this armistice agreement was of a confidential nature. Mr. Yen replied, "What kind of secret is this? I really have no knowledge of it." Mr. Yen continued by saying that Japan was still demanding that China stop the anti-Japanese movement, and that China could not agree to this, as the armistice was a military matter and should not involve political issues. Mr. Fujisawa continued by saying that if the committee wanted to supervise or manage the progress of the negotiations, this would exceed the legal powers of the committee. Thereupon, Chairman Hymans said that the committee's job was not to order armistice conditions, but the committee must monitor both sides' respect for the resolutions of the General Assembly, so the Chinese and Japanese representatives should inform their governments of this point and pay attention to it. Yen Hui-ching then expressed his gratitude to Mr. Hymans for making the true powers of the committee more evident. Furthermore, it was also gratifying that the amendments proposed by Japan were not supported by the committee. Mr. Yen said that the boycott was a popular movement, which had spread throughout China and could not be managed by the government as the Japanese claimed. The anti-Japanese movement would naturally disappear when the Japanese troops withdrew from Chinese territory. Mr. Hymans said that the committee's duties were unrelated to the issue of boycotting Japanese goods. Japanese representative Sato said that although the matter was unrelated, he wanted the Shanghai peace conference to bring the movement to an end as soon as possible. The committee then adjourned at 5:59 pm. (National News Agency telegram on the 17th)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Records Sato's Remarks</h3>
<p>The First Act of Shanghai Has Almost Ended</p>
<p>The Manchurian Issue Still Faces Many Difficulties</p>
<p>The London Chronicle today published an interview with Sato, the Japanese Chief Representative to the League of Nations, in Geneva in a question-and-answer format. In his remarks, he distinguished greatly between Shanghai and Manchuria. The interviewer asked, "Is your government satisfied with the results of its military display? Are the achievements of the military operations as expected?" Sato answered briefly, "The incident has developed in an unexpected direction." The interviewer then expressed the opinion that Japan now desperately wants to disregard its losses in Shanghai and intends to continue its policy in Manchuria. Sato did not deny this statement and said, "Shanghai, or rather, the first act, has almost ended. But I fear that there are still many difficulties in the Manchurian case." Sato continued by saying that Japan's right to the concessions in Manchuria, which it obtained through legal procedures, should be implemented in accordance with the treaties. Japan will spend ten years establishing order and tranquility in Manchuria and greatly expanding its prosperity. Japan does not want the League of Nations to interfere in its well-intentioned expansion. The interviewer also said that Sato can be said to have done his best to serve a recklessly acting country. His patience is admirable. If one did not read his courageous words, one could not help but feel that he was a diplomat burdened with heavy burdens, standing in the midst of a bleak and uncertain future. (Reuters telegram on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Japanese Government's Ceasefire Instructions</h3>
<p>Reuters Tokyo telegram on the 18th: The Japanese government has issued its final instructions regarding the ceasefire proposal to Shigemitsu Koki. It is reported that the Japanese government has stated that it is willing to handle the three points stipulated in the Chinese telegram read out yesterday by the 19-member committee of the League of Nations Council, namely: 1) The Chinese army will remain in its current position pending future resolution; 2) The Japanese army will retreat into the Public Concession and withdraw from the roads outside the Concession in the Hongkou area; 3) A joint committee including neutral parties will monitor the withdrawal of troops and the administration of the areas withdrawn from. It is reported that the Japanese government also instructed Shigemitsu Koki to firmly state that the armistice agreement is based on the presumption of convening a roundtable conference, and that the issues of boycotting Japanese goods and the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents should be discussed before the Japanese troops are completely withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Japan Has No Sincerity in Ceasing Fire</h3>
<p>There is Also a Proposal to Establish a Neutral Zone</p>
<p>The Investigation Team's Participation in the Peace Conference Has Also Been Abandoned</p>
<p>Since the basic principles were established on Monday at the Shanghai ceasefire conference, the Chinese and Japanese sides were scheduled to hold a formal meeting at the British Consulate General on Wednesday. Later, the Japanese side temporarily canceled the meeting on the grounds that the instructions from Tokyo had not arrived. According to Japanese sources, the instructions from Tokyo have now arrived in Shanghai, and it is reported that they are also advocating the establishment of a neutral zone. However, our diplomatic authorities have not yet received a formal notification. Since the Chinese and Japanese representatives did not meet yesterday, Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Koki visited British Minister Lambson last night, presumably to notify the British Minister of the contents of the new instructions from Tokyo for transmission to our side. As for the issue of the League of Nations investigation team participating in the peace conference, Lytton's aides claimed last night that there were still no instructions from Geneva on this matter, and it has probably been tacitly abandoned.</p>
<h3>Kuo Tai-chi Talks About the Ceasefire Conference</h3>
<p>Japan Used the Excuse of Not Receiving Instructions</p>
<p>Resulting in the Postponement of the Conference</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been numerous rumors about the progress of the peace conference in this city, and the truth is unclear. As a reporter, I felt that this matter was of great importance and could easily lead to misunderstandings, so I visited Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kuo Tai-chi today to inquire about the progress of the peace conference. Mr. Kuo kindly received me and replied as follows. Mr. Kuo said that since the Chinese and Japanese sides exchanged opinions in writing on the issue of the ceasefire conference on the 9th and 10th of this month (both transmitted by the British Minister), the peace conference had reached a deadlock. The Ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and France, as well as the Italian Chargé d'affaires, exchanged opinions in writing, delaying the process, and the current deadlock must be broken as soon as possible. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 14th, a tea party was held at the British Consulate, inviting me and Japanese Minister Shigemitsu to attend (this was my second meeting with Shigemitsu; the first time was more than ten days ago, also at a tea party hosted by the British Minister at the British Consulate). The parties then exchanged opinions informally for a long time. As a result, several basic principles for the agenda of the ceasefire conference were obtained, which are those published by Representative Yen in Geneva. At that time, both parties agreed to consult their governments. Our side received instructions from the Nanjing government early on, and its opinions were also disclosed by Representative Yen in Geneva. However, the Japanese Minister consistently used the excuse of not having received instructions from Tokyo, so the agreement to hold a formal meeting at 4 pm on Wednesday to decide on the agenda of the ceasefire conference could not be held. As of this time, there is still no news from the Japanese side. One more point that the outside world urgently needs to understand is that the current conference we are conducting, in addition to the Chinese and Japanese sides, the Ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and France, the Italian Chargé d'affaires, and the military representatives of all parties will also participate. The matters to be discussed are limited to matters related to the ceasefire and troop withdrawal, and are entirely based on the resolution of the League of Nations Council. All matters of a political nature will not be included, and are completely separate from the roundtable conference or the Shanghai conference that is rumored outside.</p>
<h3>More Japanese Soldiers Arriving Than Leaving</h3>
<p>16,000 Soldiers Being Sent Back</p>
<p>No Less Than 30,000 Soldiers Being Transported Here</p>
<p>The troops that Japan dispatched to fight in Shanghai this time were initially the 24th Mixed Brigade from Kurume. The brigade was fully equipped with infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers, with a total strength of about 8,000 men. They fought against our 19th Route Army in Jiangwan and Zhabei, and suffered repeated defeats and heavy losses. This time, they were ordered to withdraw and return to their country. When they withdrew from Zhenru, they held a memorial service for the fallen officers and soldiers, which shows how heavily they had been hit. They began to be redeployed back to their country yesterday. The situation is described in detail below.</p>
<h3>24th Brigade Concentrating</h3>
<p>The 24th Brigade's infantry arrived at the Zhanghuabang Railway Pier in Wusong to collect all their equipment, artillery, and baggage. Some of it had already been loaded onto transport ships and shipped in the past two days. By 3 pm yesterday, all officers and soldiers of the entire brigade had completely arrived at the pier. The Japanese Ministry of the Army had dispatched two transport ships to Shanghai to load the brigade and return to Japan. They started boarding at 3 pm.</p>
<h3>Two Ships Transporting Back to Country</h3>
<p>The commander of the 24th Brigade is Major General Shimomoto. Starting at 3 pm yesterday, he ordered his troops to board the two transport ships, Ryokai Maru and Shioku Maru. Weapons, ammunition, and other items were hoisted into the ship by crane. More than 6,000 officers and soldiers of the entire brigade boarded the ship. It was not until 5 pm that they were all boarded. Many Japanese residents in Shanghai went to the Zhanghuabang pier to see them off. By 6 pm, the loading was completed and they immediately weighed anchor and set sail, leaving the Wusongkou and heading straight for Moji.</p>
<h3>11th Division Retreating to Song</h3>
<p>The 11th Division has also been ordered to depart and return to its country. The infantry of the division in Liuhe, Jiading, and other places is now concentrating in Luodian. The cavalry, artillery, and other units in the front have also been ordered to retreat to Wusong. Yesterday, large numbers of trucks transported the army and its weapons and ammunition to Zhanghuabang and Yangshupu, preparing to return to Japan. It is reported that the division's heavy artillery and other items are more difficult to transfer, so it will take at least a week to complete the transportation. The first batch of withdrawing soldiers is scheduled to start boarding the ship at Zhanghuabang on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Replenishment of New Soldiers Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A total of 16,000 soldiers, consisting of one division and one brigade, are being withdrawn this time. However, the 14th Division's troops, which are being sent to replace them, have already been transported to the front in succession. Because they are organized according to wartime formations, including replenishment units, they number no less than 20,000. Yesterday, another team of replenishment soldiers arrived on the transport ship Front Maru, along with a destroyer each from the 15th and 26th Squadrons. These soldiers are all replenishment soldiers from the 14th Division. They were immediately dispatched to take over the defense area of the 11th Division. Therefore, the number of soldiers being withdrawn is less than the number of soldiers being transported here.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Still Preparing for War</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Increasing in the Pontoon Bridge Area</h3>
<p>Kunshan, 18th Special Telegram: A Japanese reconnaissance plane circled over the Su-Kun area at 10 am on the 18th, flying very low. It flew towards Shanghai after an hour. The Japanese troops at Yangjiaqiao, the pontoon bridge, and Loutang have been redeploying since the 16th, and have been adding troops to each position.</p>
<h3>Large Japanese Army Heading to Jiading</h3>
<p>A battalion of the Japanese 9th Division opened and was stationed in Jiading city on the 13th. Among them were Koreans and White Russians. The original Japanese troops stationed in the city, led by the director of good office Hasekawa Sadaburo, went to Xuxing town between Jiading and Liuhe. Only residents of the South Gate of the four cities were allowed to enter and exit. The enemy trenches on the side of Yuan Situ are more than three li long and more than a zhang deep. After searching the nearby civilian houses, the Japanese army hung the Japanese flag on the doors.</p>
<h3>Installing Military Telephones in Hongkou</h3>
<p>The Far East News Agency said that the Japanese army has been installing military telephones on Dixwell Road and in the Hongkou area since the day before yesterday. They were especially busy yesterday.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Specious Arguments and Atrocities</p>
<h3>Answer to Christian Inquiries</h3>
<p>The Greater America Evening Post reports that eight Japanese and Western Christian missionaries who recently arrived in Shanghai visited the Japanese Club yesterday (the 17th) afternoon. They were received by key members of the Japanese community in Shanghai. During the conversation, the missionaries first inquired about the reasons why the Japanese army bombed the Commercial Press and other cultural institutions. They then inquired about the illegal actions of the Japanese residents. The Japanese spokesperson's reply was quite remarkable, claiming that the Commercial Press was not only a center for anti-Japanese propaganda, but also a major defense position for the Zh閘北 (Zhabei) troops during the conflict. They also stated that many of the shells that struck Japanese soldiers and mistakenly landed in the concession area were also fired from the north. They further claimed that the reason for bombing various universities and educational institutions was that after the Kuomintang came to power, Chinese education had lost its true meaning and had become a tool for political propaganda. As for educational institutions that were not used for military operations, the Japanese army did not destroy them. Fudan University was cited as an example. As for the illegal actions of the Japanese residents in Hongkou, they were described as accidental incidents arising from self-defense. Before the search of the Grand Hotel in Hongkou, Chinese plainclothes troops had almost turned Hongkou into a world of terror, and Japanese residents were almost constantly in danger of being shot. Therefore, they took self-defense measures. It was admitted that there were some rogue elements among the Japanese residents, but as soon as the Japanese authorities learned of this, they immediately took action to crack down on them, and one hundred people had already been deported back to their country. It was also said that some of those who attacked the Sanyou Factory had also been sent back to their country. (Translator's note: This kind of excuse and defense by the Japanese requires our country to urgently declare the facts to reveal the truth. Therefore, this is a rough translation.)</p>

<p>The Shanghai-based Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office received a telegram from Tokyo on the 16th, stating that Japan's foreign trade in February had a deficit of 47 million Japanese yen due to increased imports of raw cotton, wheat, beans, and iron, and sluggish exports of raw silk. The total value of import trade in that month reached 128 million yen, while exports were 80 million yen. Compared with the same month last year, imports increased by 29 million yen, and exports decreased by 10 million yen. The total deficit for January and February of this year reached 93 million yuan, an increase of 87 million yuan compared with the same period last year. Trade with China in February was severely affected by the unrest in China, with exports totaling 11 million yuan, a decrease of 10 million yuan compared with the previous month, equivalent to 48%. The total value of imports was 21 million yuan, an increase of 7% compared with the previous month. The result of the two comparisons was a deficit of 10 million yuan.

<p>Telegrams and Letters for the Rescue of Wu Maizhi</p>
<h3>Various Organizations' National Salvation Associations</h3>
<p>After lawyer Wu Guo was arrested and sent to Beijing, because Wu had previously worked for various organizations, the Shanghai National Salvation Joint Association of various bodies sent letters and telegrams to the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander's Office and the 19th Route Army General Commander Jiang and Army Commander Cai yesterday. (One telegram) To the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander's Office: Lawyer Wu Guo caused a conflict by vouching for students at the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, which led to your department ordering his removal. Public opinion is rife. It is known that although Wu Guo has patriotic zeal, he has no political intentions or other background. This association has more accurate information and should be handled according to normal legal procedures, without excessive emphasis, so as not to cause social misunderstanding. We send this telegram hoping for a reply. Sincerely, Shanghai National Salvation Joint Association of Various Organizations. (One letter) Respectfully addressed to General Commander Jiang and Army Commander Cai: It is respectfully reported that on the 12th of this month, lawyer Wu Mai personally went to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to request the release of representatives of the arrested Secondary School Student Union. Due to a misunderstanding in words, a conflict occurred between the two parties, resulting in his detention and transfer to the Capital Garrison Department for interrogation on the 16th. It is known that Wu Mai is enthusiastic about patriotism, which is known throughout the country, and has no other agenda. This association can absolutely guarantee this. Your respected General Commander and Army Commander are known for caring for patriotic elements, which we admire. Therefore, we specially dispatched Lin Zhifu, Tan Bozhi, Zheng Jie, and Guan Xingxin as representatives to personally visit and request that you uphold justice and write to the Military and Political Department of the Capital Garrison Command, requesting his prompt release. We are immensely grateful and respectfully submit this request. Sincerely, Shanghai National Salvation Joint Association of Various Organizations.</p>
<h3>Lawyers' Association</h3>
<p>Respected President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: Our member Mai has no other intentions. He is simply zealous about patriotism and has offended many. This time, he went to the Public Security Bureau to request the release of students and had a quarrel with the bureau staff. Even if there was any transgression, it was a common criminal matter. However, it is reported that he has suffered greatly and has been severely injured. It is also rumored that he has been transferred to the Beijing Garrison Commander's Office. Wu is not a soldier, so what has he to do with military law? Either of these is not permitted by law. We request that you order the relevant officials to respect legal procedures and not leave any cause for criticism. This is our sincere wish. Sincerely, Li Shirui, Tan Yigong, and Lu Shaozong, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Lawyers' Association.</p>
<h3>Seeking Information on the Whereabouts of Zhao Yangjiao and his Family</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhao Yangjiao of Wujin was commissioned to handle the stamp tax affairs of Kunshan, Taicang, and Jiading two years ago and moved his entire family from Suzhou to the east side of the Qian Clan Ancestral Hall in Taicang City. During the Japanese invasion of Taicang, administrative agencies relocated in advance. As a result, all the residents of the city fled during the intense bombing. It is not known whether Mr. Zhao and his family escaped danger or where they are residing. As postal services, telegrams, boats, and vehicles have all been cut off, there is no way to inquire. His relatives and friends in Shanghai are very concerned. It has recently been heard that many people from Taicang have fled to Shanghai. We respectfully hope that anyone who knows the whereabouts of Mr. Zhao will inform his younger brother, Zhao Mengsu, at 201 Saporsey Road, Lisheng Middle School, in this city. We will be immensely grateful.</p>

<h3>Shooting Range Established in Zhaofeng Park</h3>
<p>British Soldiers Scheduled to Practice Shooting</p>
<p>Residents Need Not Misunderstand</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Shanghai Municipal Council Meeting</h3>
<p>The regular meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council was held on Wednesday, March 16th, chaired by Director-General Major General Macnaghten. The minutes of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>The General Relief Committee for Refugees proposed that a committee be appointed to consider what methods the Municipal Council should adopt to relieve poor refugees and unemployed workers. This was approved. The committee will be composed of a Chinese member and the heads of the Police, Health, and Public Works Departments. The committee should consider this issue from all angles and pay special attention to the Communist Party's attempt to use this large number of poor people to create disturbances. If necessary, the committee may submit specific proposals for consideration by the board of directors.</p>
<p>Board of Directors Election Regarding the election of directors, it was resolved to add a polling station inside the Hongkou Police Station.</p>
<p>Annual Meeting Location It was decided that this year's annual ratepayers' meeting would be held at the Carlton Theatre, and it was decided that Mr. White would serve as the chairman of the annual meeting.</p>
<p>Special Meeting The Chairman mentioned the resolution of December 9th of last year, namely, that a special meeting of ratepayers should be convened before the annual meeting to amend By-law No. 24 to solve the factory licensing problem. It was found that this amendment was indeed important so that the Municipal Council could have considerable jurisdiction over the factories. However, in view of the current situation, it was feared that the ratepayers would not pay enough attention to this issue, and there was no suitable venue other than the drill ground to accommodate this meeting. Therefore, it was feared that raising this issue at this time would be inappropriate. After discussion by the directors, they all believed that the people who could support this case were currently paying attention to restoring the normal operation of the factories and might not be able to pay attention to the implementation of new laws in the factories. As a result, it was decided that this case would not be cancelled, but would be temporarily suspended, and the Chairman would mention in his speech at the annual meeting that the Board of Directors would convene a special meeting at an appropriate time to pass this amendment.</p>
<p>Real Estate Committee Based on several discussions in previous meetings, it was decided to submit a proposal at this annual meeting to add two Chinese real estate committee members to the existing committee members.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Wuyuan and others organized the Chinese People's National Defense Army to gather the power of the people to resist violence and defend the country. It is purely out of patriotic sincerity and has been submitted to the government for approval and filed with various agencies. It is not comparable to secretly recruiting soldiers in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when a traitor's request was not granted, he falsely reported to the French Concession police, which led to a misunderstanding and detention. After investigation, there was no evidence, and I was released on the 10th. Many newspapers reported that Zhang Wuyuan was arrested for recruiting soldiers, which is inconsistent with the facts. Your newspaper has always been fair. Please agree to publish this letter to clarify the truth and avoid misunderstanding. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Zhang Wuyuan, March 17, 1932.</p>

<h3>Shen Jin Ding Discusses Recent Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>Shanghai Truce Conference Stalls</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Reporters from various newspaper agencies intended to visit Foreign Minister Luo on the morning of the 18th at 11:00 AM, but Luo was out on official business. Instead, they met with Shen Jin Ding, the Director of the Asian Affairs Department, to inquire about the recent diplomatic situation. According to Shen's response: 1) According to a Reuters dispatch yesterday, Japanese representative Sato claimed at the League of Nations that the Chinese and Japanese representatives in Shanghai had reached an understanding. This is merely Sato's propaganda. In diplomatic terms, "understanding" implies compromise. In the past proceedings of the Shanghai conference, there has been no such understanding. 2) As a result of the mediation by various foreign envoys and consuls in the Shanghai peace conference, there has been some progress in the method of Japanese troop withdrawal, and a general decision has been made on the preconditions for the conference. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from Vice Minister Guo stating that our side still adheres to the established policy of the League of Nations resolutions and Representative Yan's statements at the League of Nations, and has slightly amended the preconditions to indicate acceptance. Therefore, the time and location of the second meeting have also been decided. Unexpectedly, Japanese representative Shigemitsu Aoi used the excuse of not receiving government instructions and hoped to postpone the meeting. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a formal report from Representative Yan stating that the Japanese government had expressed agreement with the preconditions for the Shanghai conference, but Shigemitsu Aoi still claimed not to have received government instructions, which is suspected to be an excuse. As a result, the Shanghai conference has fallen into a stalemate. The Japanese side's intentions remain to be speculated. 3) The League of Nations investigation team was originally scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 20th or 21st. Recently, due to the situation in Shanghai, it may be delayed by four or five days before it can depart. After arriving in Nanjing, it will stay for approximately three days and then head north. 4) According to external reports, the Japanese side's peace conditions include: 1) Chinese troops must not advance into the area from which Japanese troops withdraw; 2) China must not have military installations within 20 kilometers of Shanghai; 3) The responsibility for the Shanghai war is to be borne by both China and Japan, and China must not make claims for compensation. These rumors may be true, but the Japanese side has not yet formally proposed them. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will definitely not agree to them, because the Shanghai incident is entirely the responsibility of the Japanese side. In our repeated protests, we have demanded to reserve this point. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A reporter met with Yu Youren and inquired about the fact that the Second Plenary Session had already decided on the separation of military and civilian governance, yet He in Hubei, Liu in Henan, and Han in Shandong had successively requested to resign from their positions as chairmen, and the central government had retained them. Yu replied that soldiers not concurrently holding political positions is the inevitable path for the separation of military and civilian governance. The central government believes that the selection of chairmen for these several provinces must be carefully considered. Before suitable candidates are obtained, the central government had no choice but to retain He and others. When asked about the proposal by members of the National Crisis Conference to lift the ban on political parties, Yu said that, in a narrow sense, it is difficult to discuss lifting the ban on political parties at present. However, all groups, except for the Communist Party, can work for the country, and there are no fixed boundaries. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Inukai Cabinet Falls</h3>
<p>Unable to Cope with Current Crisis</p>
<p>Internal Party Strife Intensifies</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 18th: This morning's special parliamentary session should pass relatively peacefully. The Upper House may even raise a serious motion of impeachment against the government. However, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi's sudden decision on March 16th to concurrently hold the position of Minister of Home Affairs has clearly demonstrated the intense internal strife within the ruling party. Therefore, many believe this is only a temporary expedient. After the parliament closes on March 25th, there will be new developments. Elder Saionji Kinmochi has been staying in Tokyo for two weeks and returned to his Okitsu villa this morning. Whether his negotiations with political figures in Tokyo to organize a national government to replace the current government have been successful is currently unknown. However, the general public believes that the Inukai Tsuyoshi cabinet does not have many days left, as the current cabinet seems unable to cope with the serious economic and political difficulties the country is facing. This requires extremely careful handling.</p>
<p>Nihon Rengo, Tokyo, 18th: The problem of cabinet reform is gradually intensifying due to the confrontation between the Suzuki faction and the Kuhara faction. Prime Minister Inukai's situation is becoming increasingly difficult. However, the Prime Minister has resolved to overcome all difficulties and implement his established policy by transferring Minister of Justice Suzuki to the position of Minister of Home Affairs and inviting Kawamura Takeji to join the cabinet. Nihon Rengo, Tokyo, 18th: The results of today's election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives are that Akita Kiyoshi and Uehara Etsujiro of the Seiyukai party were elected.</p>
<p>Nihon Rengo, Tokyo, 18th: The House of Peers convened at 9:00 AM this morning. First, Speaker Tokugawa reported on the decisions of various departments, which were approved by all members. Thus, the House of Peers was established.</p>
<h3>Japan Expands Air Force Amid Disarmament Voices</h3>
<p>Yokosuka Prepares to Establish Aircraft Factory</p>
<p>Intensifying Training of Aviation Personnel</p>
<h3>A Major Threat to Peace in East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Special Dispatch): Recently, Japan, in light of the experience of the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai and the unexpectedly outstanding effectiveness of aircraft in combat, the Navy authorities decided to establish a naval aircraft factory in Yokosuka on April 1st to serve as a unified organization for research and experimentation in aircraft production. Major General Shigehara has been internally appointed as the factory director. The objectives, organization, and budget are as follows: 1) Objectives: The factory aims to conduct research, design, trial production, and experimentation in aircraft production, liaising with the Institute of Aeronautics at the Imperial University of Tokyo. Applying the principles of aircraft production, it will practically test the production of excellent aircraft. As for mass production, it will be entrusted to civilian factories.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>2) Organization: The factory is divided into eight departments: General Affairs Department, Aircraft Department, Engine Department, Ordnance Department, Flight Experiment Department, Science Department, Medical Department, and Accounting Department. It is directly under the command of the Yokosuka Naval District and is specifically supervised by the Naval Air Headquarters. 3) Budget: It is planned to be completed over six years starting this year, with a cost of approximately 4.6 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Appendix: Naval Air Force Expansion Plan. The Japanese Navy is preparing a plan to expand the personnel of the Naval Air Force and to increase the equipment required for military facilities. It intends to request the approval of the upcoming extraordinary session of the Diet. The outline is as follows: 1) Personnel Expansion Plan: Aviation materials can be supplemented relatively quickly, but on the personnel side, it is not enough to have considerable training time. Especially in Japan, where civil aviation is still immature, it is even more important to train preparatory personnel during peacetime. 1) Correct the quota of personnel in the units, increasing the average by 40%. The current total number of personnel in the units is approximately 600, which will be changed to 1,000 as permanent personnel. 2) Increase the capacity of the Kasaura Aviation Training Squadron and train a large number of trainees at the Yokosuka Aviation Squadron. 3) Increase maintenance personnel. 4) The above personnel expansion plan will be a continuing project from this year (Showa 7) to Showa 11. The budget for this year is approximately 996,000 yen. 2) Equipment Enrichment Plan: 1) Starting this year (Showa 7), 30 Type 90 fighters and 10 Type 89 attack aircraft will be distributed to units implementing new weapons. 2) The manufacturing methods of aircraft will be based entirely on the spirit of originality, and the aim is not to imitate foreign styles. During this transition period, Type 90 aircraft will be used temporarily. 3) Airfields: 1) The construction of the Kure naval port airfield should be completed as soon as possible, and a flight squadron should be formed within the year. 2) The construction project of the Saiki airfield must also be expedited.</p>
<h3>US Government Considers Recognizing Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Kokumin, Moscow, 18th: This morning, the Soviet Russian newspapers carried a London news item that was considered extremely important. It claimed that people in the Washington government are currently discussing whether to formally recognize Soviet Russia in order to maintain the balance of power in the Pacific. If the United States decides to be friendly with Soviet Russia, the first step will be to send an envoy to open talks on a US-Russia commercial treaty.</p>
<h3>United States Rejects Import of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Negotiations to Amend British Debt are Inaccurate</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th: The United States has recently been actively boycotting Japanese goods, implementing a rejection of the import of goods transported by Japanese ships. Therefore, Japanese exports to the United States have been secretly transported by foreign ships. Japan's major shipping companies have suddenly suffered a great blow and are now planning to consult with the government on countermeasures.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Washington, 17th: Today, the State Department officially denied the rumor that the US government is planning to reorganize and resolve international debts. There have been various rumors about this, one saying that the new ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mellon, has been ordered to discuss the resolution of various issues related to international debt with the British government. Therefore, the State Department officially denied it.</p>
<h3>Russian Officials Deny Japanese Aircraft Landing on Border</h3>
<p>Kokumin, Moscow, 18th: Today, government officials formally denied the reports that a Japanese aircraft was forced to land near Station Five on the Chinese Eastern Railway within Russian territory, and that Japanese soldiers clashed with Russian border guards on the Siberian border. They stated that such reports are baseless and that they have not heard of any Japanese aircraft flying over Russian territory, nor have Japanese troops in the three eastern provinces advanced to the Sino-Russian border.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Radical Japanese Factions Engage in Major Activities</h3>
<p>Left-Leaning Groups Overthrow Militarism</p>
<p>Right-Leaning Groups Plot to Assassinate Plutocrats</p>
<p>Tokyo Hochi Shimbun received a phone call from Osaka stating that on the 13th of this month, the Osaka Prefectural Special Higher Police discovered that the Japanese Shortwave Wireless Telephone League, located in Toda Town, Nishinomiya City, was about to launch a left-wing mass movement. Since the Manchurian Incident in mid-September of last year, the League has secretly communicated with branches in Kanto, Osaka, Mie, Miyagi, Aichi, Kyoto, Hyogo, and other regions, preparing to hold large-scale rallies in early April. Advocating for the overthrow of militarism and promoting peace, they are carrying out activities to promote left-wing ideology. The masterminds, Yasukawa, Kataoka, and a woman named Yamada, have installed sophisticated machinery in the headquarters and are using various broadcasting stations such as AK, BK, and CK to disseminate Anti-militarism ideology. The situation is extremely unstable.</p>
<p>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun received a phone call from Kawasaki stating that the Kawasaki Prefectural Police Station convened all officers at 5:00 AM on the 12th and arrested 13 left-leaning elements from cell organizations in various factories within the jurisdiction, and seized firearms and ammunition. It also stated that the Metropolitan Police Department, in light of the continuous assassination incidents, which are primarily the activities of right-leaning groups, and because right-leaning groups have subtle relationships with the political and financial worlds, has encountered various obstacles. Therefore, the recent consolidation of right-leaning groups has increased dramatically. The Metropolitan Police Department has begun investigating right-leaning parties A, B, and C, and will thoroughly crack down on them in the same way as left-leaning groups. Because the assassination and violent acts of right-leaning groups poison society, they are no different from left-leaning groups. In order to eliminate these two extreme ideologies, the Ministry of Justice is scheduled to convene the Criminal Law Revision Committee on the 16th. Those who violate the Public Security Preservation Law will be sentenced to capital punishment.</p>
<p>Jilin Self-Defense Army</p>
<h3>Advances on Harbin in Three Routes</h3>
<p>Wang, Ding, and Li Each Lead an Army</p>
<p>Black Generals Rise Up to Resist Ma</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The National Salvation Army led by Wang Delin retreated to the area between Erdaohezi and Ning'an County because the Japanese army advanced to Ningguta. At the same time, Zhu Guang's regiment of Zhao Zhixiang's 21st Brigade joined the National Salvation Army and also established contact with each other. Liu Zhenbang, the commander of the security brigade stationed in Ning'an County, motivated by patriotic indignation, also led his entire brigade to follow Wang. Therefore, the momentum of the National Salvation Army is very strong, with a population of over 4,000. The Jilin Self-Defense Army led by Ding Chao and Li Du and the actions of Wang's troops are also consistent. The Japanese army, which advanced to Hailin and Ningguta, hesitated to attack. The National Salvation Army attacked Ningguta on the 7th of this month and sent a detachment to attack Hailin Station to lure the Japanese army. When the Japanese army counterattacked, the National Salvation Army ambushed them in the mountains, killing over 200 Japanese soldiers. Therefore, the Japanese army dared not fight back and only used aircraft to scout various locations every day. The National Salvation Army defended against the Japanese army's counterattacks, so they also changed their plan. Wang Delin led over 2,000 troops to attack Dunhua to disperse the Japanese army's forces. At the same time, using the tactic of feinting east and attacking west, Liu Zhenbang led over 2,000 troops to attack Hailin and Ningguta to restrain the Japanese army in that direction. Ding Chao led over 7,000 troops from the Self-Defense Army to bypass Hailin from Yanxian County and seize Yimianpo and Wuzhuhe, cutting off the Japanese army's retreat and advancing towards Harbin. Li Du led over 3,000 troops from the Self-Defense Army to take Binzhou from Fangzheng. A mobile detachment of 1,000 cavalrymen appeared in the Laoshantou and Huangshanzi area east of Harbin at 3:00 PM today (10th). The Japanese army was caught off guard by the surprise attacks and was at a loss. Today, the general Han traitors in Harbin, under the control of the Japanese, celebrated the establishment of the puppet state. Upon hearing this news, they were panicked. Merchants also closed their shops. About 500 Japanese troops rushed to eastern Harbin to intercept. Sentries were stationed on the main streets and alleys inside the port. Major Hyakutake of the Japanese Special Service Agency also visited the director of the Eastern Railway, requesting cars to transport troops. The railway bureau agreed to attach 100 cars, which were dragged at 7:00 PM. Currently, the Japanese army in Harbin is estimated to be only 1,000 people, so they are very fearful. The puppet police reserve Second Brigade stationed in Harbin was surrounded and defeated by Li Du's troops 20 li south of Fangzheng County at noon on the 9th after leaving Binzhou on the 7th of this month. The remnants retreated to Binzhou and Fektu for reorganization. Liu Baolin's unit, the puppet police reserve First Brigade stationed in Yimianpo, was very afraid of the Self-Defense Army. Upon hearing that the Self-Defense Army had counterattacked, many fled. The common people have extremely bad feelings towards the puppet Jilin army. Although the Self-Defense Army lacks food and pay, its discipline is excellent. The puppet Jilin army loots and rapes everywhere, which the common people are very disgusted with.</p>
<p>There are reports that changes are about to occur within the Black Army. Because Ma Zhanshan surrendered to Japan, the commander of the Harbin-Manzhouli Railway Protection Army and commander of the Hulunbuir Garrison, Su Bingwen, is about to be replaced. Su did not approve of Ma's surrender to Japan and has concentrated his Second Brigade troops in the Hailar and Manzhouli area, refusing to accept Ma's puppet orders. He has also contacted Cheng Zhiyuan's Eighth Cavalry Brigade and Yuan Chonggu's First Infantry Brigade, planning to resist Ma. Ma recently transferred Cheng's brigade to open the Harbin-Manzhouli line, but Cheng did not obey. Yuan's brigade also did not move. Although Yuan resigned as brigade commander, his subordinates still follow him. Ma had no choice but to wait until after the establishment of the puppet state to use the military and political ministry's puppet orders to order the suppression of Su and borrow the power of the Japanese army. Therefore, the conflict on the Harbin-Manzhouli line is not far away. (10th)</p>
<h3>The China Merchants Bureau's Shanghai-Suzhou Route "Yongsheng" Steamer Robbed</h3>
<p>Passengers Unharmed, but Losses Amount to Several Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Case of Robbery on Suzhou-Jiaxing Steamer Already Solved</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's "Yongsheng" small steamer, on the 14th, towed one company boat and five civilian boats from Shanghai, carrying over 170 passengers to Suzhou. On the way, it ran aground for two hours. Around 5 a.m. on the 15th, while passing the Banbiangang area where Wujiang and Wuxian counties meet, it suddenly encountered four bandit boats carrying over 70 bandits, armed with a total of eight pistols and rifles. They first fired shots as a warning, then ordered the steamer to stop. They jumped onto the steamer and searched the passengers, stripping them of all cash, gold and silver jewelry, valuables, and even the clothes on their bodies. They also kidnapped one passenger with luxurious clothing and the driver, taking them to the bandit boat. After questioning by the bandit leader, and confirming they were not wealthy, they were immediately released. Around 6 a.m., the bandits ordered the steamer to depart. The steamer arrived in Suzhou at noon. Although no one was injured in the incident, the passengers were greatly frightened. After verification by the accounting office, the passengers' losses amounted to approximately five or six thousand yuan. The incident was reported to the military police and security committee, requesting prompt measures to protect the safety of passengers on the route.</p>
<p>On the 13th, the Ningshao Company's "Ningchang" small steamer, traveling from Suzhou to Jiaxing, was robbed by bandits in the Paotaiwan area of Wujiang County. Many male and female hostages were kidnapped. Afterward, Zhang Guifang, captain of the 15th squad of the Pingwang Water Public Security, along with Li Xiaotang, captain of the second squad, and Captain Xue of the Wujiang Water Patrol, led more than ten police boats in pursuit. Around 1 p.m. on the 15th, they encountered the bandit gang in the Yahebang area in front of the temple. There were six bandit boats and over 40 bandits. Initially, they encountered three or four bandit sentries on the shore. After exchanging gunfire, more bandits appeared, and both sides formally opened fire. After two hours of intense fighting, the bandits were unable to hold their ground and scattered. One bandit was killed on the spot, two were injured, and one, Li Fengzi from Wulu, was captured alive. Four bandit boats and three rifles were seized. Twelve male and female hostages were rescued from the two bandit boats, all of whom had been kidnapped from the "Ningchang" steamer. Their names are as follows: (1) Ye Ruyin, 29 years old, from Shanghai, a correspondent for the Shen Bao stationed in Beijing; (2) Cao Zhonghe, 23 years old, from Suzhou; (3) Qian Baoqing, 49 years old, from Suzhou; (4) Song Zijie, 29 years old, from Pingwang; (5) Song Tao, 29 years old; (6) Song Dayuan, 3 years old; (7) Miss Zhou from Suzhou, 19 years old; (8) Miss Zhu, 27 years old, from Ningbo, a relative of Chiang Kai-shek; (9) Miss Zhu's nanny, 49 years old; (10) Zhu Xiaonan, 3 years old; (11) Yin Huali, 27 years old; (12) Mr. Lu. All those kidnapped from the "Ningchang" steamer were rescued. They spent the night at Hengjing. It is reported that after being kidnapped, they were confined in the cabins of two bandit boats and repeatedly threatened and coerced into writing letters home demanding huge ransoms. The ransom demands were very high, with Miss Zhu's being 100,000 yuan and the others several tens of thousands of yuan. From the time they were kidnapped until their rescue, they were on the bandit boats for a total of 49 hours. Fortunately, the authorities solved the case quickly, and they did not suffer for a long time. It was also learned that although passengers jumped into the river during the robbery, after a search by the water police, no one drowned.</p>
