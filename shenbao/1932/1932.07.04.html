<p>時評</p>
<h3>三論「剿匪」與「造匪」</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>匪之所由滋生。匪勢之所由張大。及匪之不可以武力剿滅。夫人都已知之矣。然則眞正「剿匪」之道究如何。曰在於「澄清政治。安定民生。」請畢其說。</p>
<p>最近報載蔣介石氏在牯嶺對各軍政長官訓話有曰。「剿共不能專靠武力。這次剿共要用七分政治。三分軍事。總要政治上有辦法。政治上軌道。剿匪方可成功。政治上最重要的是求政治的清明。要清明政治。先要賞罰嚴明。」</p>
<p>必澄清政治而後「剿匪」方可成功。蔣氏亦已言之矣。雖說澄清政治。固未易言也。今日政治上之所以紛亂。其最大之癥結。即爲貪污。爲不廉潔。從政人員之能潔身自好者。實如鳳毛麟角。上自政府要員。下至地方警察。大抵都惟知私利是競。於國帑則予取予求。公私不分。於人民則搜刮榨壓。備極慘毒。賣官嚮爵。賄賂公行。病民禍國。槪非所計。舉例而言。鴉片公賣。已成公開之秘密。稅局黑暗。亦爲無可隠諱之事實。吾人但看今日之一入官門者。即成富翁。一錢一物。無不來自民間。無不爲人民之血汗。官愈肥而民愈瘦。一家笑而萬家哭。此種黑暗政治。殆爲曠古所罕見。故今日而言澄清政治。其最先之要着。即爲澈底肅清貪污吏。建設廉潔政治。殺一貪官污吏。實勝於動員一師剿匪軍隊。整飭一師之軍紀。不欠餉。嚴加訓練。使其自身先不匪化。則又勝於動員十萬剿匪大軍。蓋今日之事。與其積極「剿匪。」母寗消極不「造匪。」而懲治貪污。整飭軍紀。正即所以杜絶匪之來源也。</p>
<p>次之。匪之所由滋生。及其勢之所由張大。吾人前已言之。爲由生活之逼迫。今日農村之破落。與農民生計之艱難。實已至極巓湘鄂贛豫皖諸省固無論矣。即素稱富饒之江浙。今亦凋敝不堪。蠶絲爲江浙出產之大宗。今已一落千丈。不可復振。養蠶之家。無以餬口。多仰天痛哭。又以累歲荒歉。民食艱難。勢惟有仰望外米之接濟。夫以夙稱以農立國之國家。而衣食皆仰給於外國。是則此不僅爲嚴重之農村問題。實即爲我民族之生死問題。農村旣呈江河日下之勢。則迫於生計挺而走險者亦日以加多。故不安定民生。决無以絶匪滋生之根源。而欲言安定民生。則又必以解决農村問題爲最要之先着。</p>
<p>總之今日之所謂「匪」者。與其謂爲由於共黨政治主張之煽惑。毋寗謂爲由於政治之壓迫與生計之驅使。政治如不改革。民生如不安定。則雖無共黨煽惑。紊亂終不可免。歷史上之黃巢李自成張獻忠以至袁世凱時代白狼之亂。即其例證。故今日「剿匪」爲揚湯止沸。澄清政治安定民生。乃爲　底抽薪。此次「剿匪須用三分軍事七分政治。」吾人深盼政府有以實踐其言。吾人深盼此七分之政治能見諸事實。</p>

<h3>洛桑會議最後掙扎</h3>
<p>五國計劃一再修改送逹德代表</p>
<p>復興基金曁付欵條件卒被拒絶</p>
<p>國民社二日洛桑電　洛桑會議各主幹委員（德國除外）今日已同意一計劃、將於明晨由主席英相麥唐納送交德代表、聞其内容、五國已决定要求德國於停付期满經濟復興之後、輸助善後基金約共四十萬萬馬克、至於法國所索對於美債之保障條文、料將删除、但隠含一種辦法、倘美國堅持還債、則假定由德國發行債券償付、因此今日英代表圑頗表示樂觀、但亦承認明日將爲一危急時期、德人之能否應允、將於此日卜之、現計劃詳情已於今晚非正式告知德方、料德國明日未必能同意、果爾則五國或將被迫用哀的美頓手段、否則若事勢能有相當進步、則德國或能即於明晚出席主幹委員會全體會議、又東歐賠欵一組、今日下午第一次開會、由英外相西門主席、開始準備編製報告書、</p>
<p>路透三日洛桑電　自賠欵會議開幕以來、英相麥唐納工作至忙、旣須與諸國代表分頭接洽、復須與其閣僚會商一切、而夜中睡寐又輒苦不足、今已漸呈瘦容、其醫士力勸勿過事操勞、然麥氏置之不顧、今晨八時三十分即接見意外相格蘭第、未幾又接見德總理巴本德外長牛賴資、嗣又參與主幹五委員會議、討論片刻、即延會至今晚五時、德國果如預料、已拒絶繳付歐洲修復金四十二萬萬馬克、並拒絶關於付欵之某種條件、現料雙方磋商將再歷二十四小時、麥唐納宣稱、至星期二日如有必要、渠擬多駐一二日、俾會議之工作可獲結局、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯三日洛桑電　今晨十時三十分、五債權國代表開會時、麥唐納報告渠頃與德國總理及各部長晤談之情形、麥氏曾將債權國繕具之解决草案、交與德國各閣員、草案全文、包含條欵十二、共計二頁、但德國包付欵項之分配問題、各國同意歸債權國主持、故未列入草案、德總理及其閣僚、閱悉草案後、向麥氏宣稱、債權國向德國政府所提之條件、未免過苛、若德國現政府予以接受、則影響所及、下届衆院選舉結果、必將使國家社會黨或共產黨登台執政、德國閣員請求與其代表圑從長商議、麥唐納將於今日下午重行接見德國各部長、故麥氏請求五國代表逗留洛桑、以便本日傍晚由渠主席舉行會議時、各該代表得以參加、</p>
<h3>英法議定延付三年</h3>
<p>路透二日洛桑電　洛桑局勢黯淡歷一星期、今日急轉直下、已具樂觀、債權國代表現皆確信賠欵會議成功有望、凡此樂觀乃債權國對於債權國間困難有所妥協之結果、衆料德國可就範圍、殆無疑義、故世界大會之門即將開放、英首相麥唐納·商部大臣任錫曼·與法總理赫禮歐·財長馬丁·會商終日、始議定現將提交德代表之計畫、内有延長德國停付時期三年、然後俟國際清理銀行决定德國償繳每年付欵之能力後再行償付一條、英法政治家在討論中意見不同之主要、爲德國償付歐洲修復金之數目、但此困難卒已銷釋、英法雙方皆聲稱所有各點均已議妥、聞德國所須償付歐洲修復金之數目、已定爲四十萬萬馬克左右、</p>
<h3>新計劃難產之主因</h3>
<p>國民社二日洛桑電　洛桑賠欵會議似已在最後掙扎这中、現德國代表正在靜候五大債權國最後具體計劃書之送到、該項計劃書本可於今日到逹德國代表圑、惟所以遲遲尙未送到者、其原因不外（一）因德國自經預先探悉計劃書之内容後、表示極端反對、致該計劃書修改二次、至今尙未具體成立、（二）因債權國家之中、意見猶未一致、英法兩國之間、據云爭執頗烈、此兩種原因、各方難極隠秘、要亦以爲最後計劃難產之主因也、</p>
<h3>德國重申不勝負擔</h3>
<p>國民社二日洛桑電　今日德外長紐拉思曾與英首相麥唐納會議一次、當時紐氏即陳述新計劃詞意浮泛、决不能認爲永久解决一重大問題之方案、而歐洲經濟之復興、旣端賴此次會議結果之圓满、故新計劃實無增進歐洲經濟發展之希望云、後論及該計劃書之特點、德外長復稱、依照該項新計劃、德國應支出一鉅額欵項、約在五十萬萬至七十萬萬馬克之間、但觀德國國内財政凋蔽之情况而言、此項鉅欵實難籌措、恐即經長期之展延、亦難以成爲事實、再則德外長對於近日建議之新方式、將賠欵與戰債并爲一談、德國實不能贊同云、麥唐納自與紐拉思會談之後、當晚即召集五債權國代表、會商如何消除各債權國間之異議、俾對德國之反對、有一聯合應付之方、但經過長時間之討論後、猶未能有何結果、故會議遂延至明日再開、而法總理赫禮歐即於散會後遄返巴黎、法財長雅曼馬丁、則於赫氏缺席時代行法總代表事務、</p>
<h3>英法見解不同之點</h3>
<p>聞目下英法兩國意見不同之點、大致法國之意見、各債權國應先得有保障、庶幾與美國修訂戰債協定之談判失敗時、法國有所依傍、再法國之意、保障條件中應除去美國二字、而代以世界之解决、謂倘使世界之解决能成立、則法國願將所應供給之歐洲經濟善後基金、减少其半、但以現在戰債問題尙在渺茫之中、故法國不得不向德國要求一最低限度之數目約在六十萬萬馬克之譜、此數法國萬難再减云、英國方面意見則覺法國不必如此堅持保障之先成立、因如此則會議將無法進行、而兼使各國間發生糾紛、再則據英國代表圑人物之見解、美國旣正待賠欵會議之成功、倘歐洲各國間能對於賠欵問題成立一種合理諒解、美國方面未始不可從此而採取和緩之態度、但决不受任何國之脅迫而讓步、此英法雙方爭執之大致也、</p>
<h3>會議前途未許樂觀</h3>
<p>故據此而觀察賠欵會議之前途、深覺頗難有圓满之結果、即以英國方面而論、昔日堅持樂觀之態度者、今亦轉覺前途之暗淡、而現憂慮之色矣、至於法國之態度則自始至終即抱悲觀、而其憤懑之色、則反與日俱增、如法財長雅曼馬丁氏竟謂「德國無他意、直待賴債耳」云、</p>
<h3>調查圑抵日本</h3>

<p>海林經寗安到東京城、已經築有鐵路、鍾城去穏城很近、接通即可逹清津港、聞敦化至寗安的工程、估計爲日金二千萬元、海林至穏城、距離雖然和敦化到寗安差不多、但是沿途多山、施工不易、估計需日金三千萬元現在延吉已設立工程局、實行鋪軌、預料十月間即可通車、</p>
<p>現爲易於明瞭起見、將日人最近的計畫、即吉會路、舍却軍事而言經濟、則目的在開發吉林、可分本線及培養線如下、（請參看地圖、凡畫虚線之處、皆是爲未築成之路、）</p>

<p>延吉爲日人預定爲集圑殖民的區域、希望將朝鮮和吉林打成一片、故對於此路沿線的耕地有詳密的調查、現一併照錄如下、以供參考、</p>

<p>又恐路警爲人利用、特由一千七百人限制爲一千二百人、而添招白俄二百人、在溝帮子訓練、以便逐漸更替、新民柳河興城一帶的橋樑、則有農民式的便衣兵　守、在日軍官指揮之下、防範有人刦車、日人力謀侵占該路、已代編造四個年度的預算、自僞國大同元年至大同四年將支出特别增加、使其有虧無盈、同時　南满鐵路、偕用車輛及材料、爲變相　　之一種、已租的爲機關車十八輛、和客車二列、此次該路所備的國聯調查圑專車也是用南满車輛改裝的、關於英國的借欵、自一月份起、日人已按月照付、惟須英人與該路直接、以後日本在該路和英國同有債權的關係、而實權則操在日人手内、已經是顯而易見了、</p>
<p>與此路有關係的葫　島築港、日人本極反對、但因與荷蘭訂有契約、倘由日本出面推翻、必惹起國際惡感、故現已改變方針、承認照舊進行、不過完工以後、將設法歸南满鐵道會社經營、作爲大連的輔助港、不使成爲中國鐵路的競爭口岸、（未完）</p>

<h3>古廟敲鐘錄（四二）</h3>
<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>四十六一夜平安無事。朱先生告訴我：「昨天是開了學。所希奇的是没有揀日子大家也肯來上課你看這軍事生活是多麽重要的一種敎育。牠能培養大無畏的精神以打破無理的膽怯。牠能培養圑體生活的習慣以打破農人一盤散沙的無政府的脾氣。民衆在自已的武力保護之下纔能過合理的生活辦合理的敎育。你們覺得如何？」「我說；一先生的主張我完全贊同。可是單單訓練這二十幾個有槍的人，效力未免太小，我們要想個法子使這種訓練普遍於全村才行。」朱先生說；「對！全村皆兵，全鄉皆兵，全縣皆兵，全省皆兵，全國皆兵，而實無一個靠當兵吃飯的兵，乃是普及軍事敎育的最大目的。我們在村說村，今天得召集一個村民大會公議全村皆兵的計畫，」江先生說；「現在是人多槍少，可以規定鐘點、分排輪流衷練。一天每排訓練一小時，二十多枝槍我可以訓練六排人。六個人共使一枝槍。一旦有事，傷一個，上一個，人傷了五個而槍還在第六個人的手中。我們抱着人可死槍不可失的精神出而應戰，必定是鐵城一樣的難破。」我說；「壯丁全體必須一律受射擊訓練，這是無可懷疑的。但是一旦臨陣要六個人保一枝槍在運用人力一方面看來，似乎是有點不經濟。我的意見想加組織大刀隊助戰。」江營長說；「大刀砍了人，血迹被風一吹，凝結起來，便不好使用，遠不如刺劍。我贊成加組劍隊；矛子也有大用何妨再組一矛隊，那就人人具備戰鬥力，聲勢浩大，可以不戰而退人之師。」我說；「我會打幾手拳，一次我和王老二開玩笑，三拳兩腿竟把他手上的槍奪了過來。會打拳的可以借人家的槍打人，不會打拳的只是拿槍送上門給人打。依我看來，我們必得人人學會打拳纔行。」江營長很以爲然，朱先生間本村可有好的拳師。我說；「要學奪槍的本領必得請一位會打散手拳的拳師。我那師傳張飛虎一生心血都在散手上。他會一百多套散手。我們化費一二年光陰學他三四十套也就得了一些基本的功夫，以後繼續學去必定可以發生很大的力量。他也會劍術，矛子是不必說了。張師傅是住在萬松嶺那邊，如果他肯來，必定可以帮助江營長造成一支無敵的民圑。」</p>

<h3>男子雙打决賽法選手擊敗英國組</h3>
<p>｜六比○·四比六·三比六·七比五·七比五｜男子雙打因有前年世界無敵將軍美國愛律生與范令參加、以爲錦標非彼莫屬、不料複賽中爲法國勃魯寗與巴洛屈拉以六比三、六比二、六比四之直落三擊敗、是項得决賽權者、爲上述之法國組與英國潘萊與休士、兩組實力相等、形勢平均、英國組先以○比六、六比四、六比三佔優於前三盤、不料最後兩盤、以五比七、五比七連敗於法國組、錦標遂照巴洛屈拉與勃魯寗、</p>

<h3>鐵路負責運輸法規基本原則</h3>
<p>— 鄭寳照</p>
<p>（一）引言吾嘗謂鐵路徵收運費、承運貨物、非獨在法律方面、應根據權利義務之理論、就自身權力可能以内、擔負相當責任、卽以發展鐵路營業而言、實亦有謁力負責之必要、蓋鐵路與客商之間、利害相關、休戚與共、並非風馬牛各不相及、從表面上觀察、鐵路在合理範圍以内、負責賠償損失、增加支出、似乎不利、顧稍加研究、則知鐵路擔負合理化之責任、直接可以分輕客商之負擔、减少損失之發生、間接卽可以扶助貨物之暢流、促進運輸之發展、其所以福利路商雙方者、至大至巨、故在歐美鐵路、對於貨物運輸、早已實行負責辦法、雖各有特殊條例、詳細規定負責問題、但在原則上自接運起、至卸運止、無不盡力、擔負保管貨物之責、並設法防止人力可以避免之一切損失、以期安全之至多、損失之至少、萬一在權力可能範圍以内、急於保管之注意及處置、以致不幸發生損害、則一律須負賠償之責、未聞有不負責之說、然則彼邦之鐵路營業、蒸蒸日上、貨物暢流、工商發展、不亦宜耶、試觀我國鐵路貨運、雖有鐵路負責與貨主負責兩種規定、並有部頒貨車運輸負責通則、但在事實上僅有關外四洮鐵路、早已辦理負責運輸、至於關内各路、祗有北寗鐵路現已實行、而在其他各路、所謂負責運輸、大都雖有若無、幾同虚設、偶或有之、亦屬極少、蓋以鐵路方面、因種種關係、不能盡保管安全之職、故多數客商、雖不願多出運費、按照鐵路負責報運、或寜願自身負責、直接報運、或委託居間人間接報運、而由居間人代負其責、以致客商貨物難得安全之保障、銷運爲之阻滯、舉凡生產銷費之支配、工商事業之進展、莫不發生障碍、而鐵路運輸、亦大受影響、近來鐵道部有見於此、爰採取歐美負責運輸制度、斟酌各路實際狀况、規定施行程序、並已令津浦鐵路卽日籌備進行、更派專員前往指導、俟津浦路實行後、再推及其他各路、以期一致、竊以爲實行負責運輸、實爲促進各路貨物運輸扶助工商事業之要道、兹有大部通盤主持於上、各路積極籌辦於下、是將來此事進行之順利、及成績之完满、自可指日而待、吾人爲鐵道事業、爲國計民生、均不禁欣盼之至、現當負責運輸籌備時期、應行預先規劃之事項、固屬紛繁、而訂立完全法規宻便遵循、則似爲尤要、　照於奉命籌備之餘、敢以公餘之暇、從事研究歐美鐵道負責運輸法規之基本原則、兹就見聞所及、擇要陳述於左、東麟西爪、藉供參考之資料云爾、（未完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>二一技谭</p>
<h3>萬婦髮</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>受了九一八和一二八的重大激刺、軍把帝國主義者聲聲署駡，這是没有效用的。倘使言駡可以當做武器，那麽駡街婦人，可以充當女先鋒女司令官了！呵呵！豈有此理？</p>
<p>俗語道的好；吃一次的虧，受一次的敎訓。但看東洋人吃了巷戰的虧，現在拚命的練習巷戰了；取人之長，補已之短，這是國人應有的常識。</p>
<p>昔年，日本遊就館中，陳列甲午中日戰爭的勝利品，見了，足使中國志士，人人裂眦。就中最可恥的，便是軍艦上的許多德政匾；什麽德被梯航，什麽海涵春育；都是下級官吏孝敬上司的東西；當年的海軍將士，腐敗到這般地步，無怪一戰以後，前清經營慘淡的海軍，變做　花一現。</p>
<p>但是。遊就館中又有婦女頭髮繩一盤；繩徑寸許，計長百尺，是日本海車部出品。上有說明書，略謂：｜甲午之役，男子都赴戰地，婦女亦各盡具義務；宮域縣仙台士族，有民婦日氏家直子，糾合同志，剪萬婦髮，製爲長繩，供獻政府，轉送海軍，以供計伐支那戰艦之用。士卒見其母妻姊妹之髮，無不感泣致死！云云。</p>
<p>唉｜中國婦人的剪髮，已成了普徧的風氣！近年以來，剪髮的婦女，正不知有幾千百萬？只是可惜了，可惜没有貢獻海軍，作抗日救國之用！彼國婦女的剪髮，是受着愛國心的驅遣；我國婦女的剪髮，是受着摩登化的驅遣；同一剪髮，那便失之毫釐，差以千里了！</p>
<h3>蒙人之愛國準備</h3>
<p>— 田隅老農</p>
<p>頃接友人郭景澄君自满洲里來函。謂該地蒙人。洞悉日人行爲奸詐。舉動橫暴。三省同胞。備遭殘殺。莫不義憤塡膺。力圖抵抗。故日人雖百般利誘。不爲所屈。惟因實力薄弱。不得不虚與周旋。誘其彈械。暗中積草屯糧。加緊訓練。一俟中央出師討伐。當即揭竿響應。俾收夾擊之效云云。其處心積慮。愛國熱誠。實堪欽佩。亟删錄之於左。</p>
<p>幣重言甘　蒙族自成吉思汗以武力雄霸歐亞。强悍之風。著稱於世。近雖稍衰。然俗尙武勇、長於騎射。故日人侵襲遼吉以來。憚其兇悍。即遣使游說。贈械饋餉。多方籠絡。冀收爲已用。奈各旗王公貝勒。深明大義。表面上佯與周旋。誘其械彈。補充實力。實際上仍擁護中央。不爲所屈。日人見計無所施。徒失械餉。於是授意僞國。對於蒙人格外優待。舉凡新頒行之苛捐重稅。槪予寛免。以示好感。又使僞國當局。交結蒙旗王公。許以重利。嗾使脫離中央。與彼合作。事又不果。日人乃知蒙人之終不爲我用焉。稍防範之。然亦不敢遽與反顏。增一勁敵。此爲雙方現在之情形也。</p>
<p>秣馬厲兵　蒙人旣誘得日軍大批械彈後。即密令所屬。積草屯糧。預爲貯備。一方復挑選精壯。加緊訓練。男丁在十五歲以上。四十歲以下者。槪須入伍操練。女子則派任運輸。各司所事。有條不紊。大有秣馬厲兵。一觸即發之勢。惟因日方器械銳利。尙不敢貿然起義。深恐戰事一作。勢力不敵。又無後援。勢必陷於絶境。爲所消滅。故目下一意撫循部屬。激厲士氣。靜候中央出師討伐時。當即首起響應云云。噫。蒙人忠誠如此。未　我執政當局。以何策規復三省。拯人民於水火之中耶。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>世界最長的遺囑。要算是倫敦一位太太佛羅倫絲柯克夫人MrsFlorencecooke所做的那一份了。伊二十歲時開始做起。到四十歲時病死爲止。凡是他一生所有。記載得鉅細靡遺。足足寫满了八大卷。而伊全部的財產。不過値五千金鎊。</p>
<p>德廢皇廉威二世在位時。氣燄極盛。不可一世。他的御　上的號角。吹出一句有韻的調子。「太，帝，太太」。市人一聽得這聲音。就知道皇帝來了。連忙肅靜廻避。在威廉以爲這號角的音調是他所獨創的。其實猶太敎徒在「改過日」用牡羊角所吹出來的調子。也是這一套。</p>
<p>英國航空總部通告全國公私飛機。每飛過韋泊昔特動物院Whipsuadezoo時必須飛得極高。因爲院中畜類一聽得引擎軋軋之聲。往往奔突驚亂之故。</p>
<h3>畫象所藏付刼灰</h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>嘉定自建縣後。人文卓著。然値鼎革之際。如棄池半泓。其水未涸。西林殘石。碧血猶新。往往令人唏嘘景仰。雖渺若漢魏。而敬恭桑梓。不能自已。先哲程穉衡當清道光庚戌歲。恐人文往蹟。化爲雲烟。遂以表章爲已任。繪練川名人畫象六卷。續編三卷。訖同治甲子。復遭兵燹。未刻之象。亦因以澌滅不傳。嗣光緒初年。槎南張修府在永州商之於仁和王文勤。集貲重刋。而不能網羅搜採。遺佚放失。晦瞑不彰。沈霾於地下者多矣。</p>
<p>客歲春。邑中張鴻年顧紀常兩君。懼先輩典型之失墜。發起重印三百部。而身任印貲之半。餘以同志雅好者促成之。而是書得以復睹於世。其版初存湘中。洎民初。歸程氏族子朗村家。後以公欵。購歸公有。藏諸存仁堂中。以示鄭重焉。而歷二十年。一無毁損。顧重印時。檢點原版。第三卷缺少第一頁。爲總兵錢先生象。名世楨。字士孫。號三持。爲萬曆已丑武科科進士。仕至薊遼鎭總兵官。爲蘇州衛前所鎭撫。其圖戴將軍冠。衣甲。持錐。披　。而摺疊難繪。覔得原書。託顧君景災於滬上補刋。始得完璧。而其事方　焉。</p>
<p>所異者。錢先生當明時。朝鮮被倭犯。朝議發兵東征。經略宋應昌。疏加游擊銜。隷前鋒。倍道渡鴨綠江。至平壤。都督李如松。約先登者賞萬金。酬世襲指揮使。先生率七百騎克之。遂北過大同江。斬倭驍將而還。主者詰其姓。無以對。乃没其功。因作軍中謠曰。『行營只自依旂鼓。接刃何嘗問姓名。』其慷嘅不平。言外可見。不意此次存仁堂復爲日軍所燬。梨棗盡付一炬。而補刋先生之版。甫一載。而又索諸燼餘而不得。豈刼數固有前定歟。</p>

<p>「要面子」這是一句含有什麽意義的話呢？女子多數是最「要面子」的，伊們出門會客，必定要穿一件漂亮的衣服，不夠，再加上些首飾，越是値錢越好。這些無謂的虚榮心，女子們便呌做「要面子」。在某一種意義下面，「要面子」還可以算是一種美德的。</p>
<p>許多「蜜絲」和「蜜雪絲」們，爲了喜歡那所謂「面子」，不惜「犧牲血本」，舉行人格大廉價，去換得金錢，再用金錢去買「面子」。有許多，她們的肉體和精神也因此賣出去了。一生的幸福也因此賣出去了。最麽可憐的「面子」啊！</p>
<p>我曾經讀過世界大文豪莫泊三氏的小說「項練」，描寫一個敎育部書記的老婆，因爲做了一夜的「面子」，嚐盡了人生的凄苦；而黃梁夢醒，忽然明白過來：原來那一夜所做的還是一個「假面子」，這一篇小說的故事眞動人，尤其是它的結局，用一個喜劇的塲面，傳逹了無限沈痛的深意。畢竟是大文豪的傑作，讀了是使人異樣感動的！</p>
<p>新近，天一影片公司已把「項練」改編爲劇本，搬到銀幕上，變爲「一夜豪華」了。在銀幕上看，故事的形式改變了不少，精神上似乎也有了進一步的傳逹。「一夜豪華」當中，不但針砭了「面子」的要不得，並且把女子爲什麽「要面子」的結癥也指點出來了。</p>
<p>「要面子」，爲什麽要這無聊的「面子」？｜「一夜豪華」勇敢地向「要面子」的女人開了三大砲，也對「要面子」的紳士社會掃射了一陣。這影片，確實没有三角戀愛片那樣時髦，但，它却是女性現代病的一服藥。藥，自然没有巧克力那樣好吃，但它會把你的病立刻醫好了。</p>
<p>姑娘們，太太們，你們都去看看「一夜豪華」吧！我虔誠地爲你們介紹，你一定能得到很大的代價！</p>
<h3>世界女航空家的發逹史（二）</h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>我們不要確信盧騷氏所說的話，卽他所說男子是强而自動的，女子是弱而被動的，所以女子和男子就在能力上，到底也不能平等。換句話說，就是無論在生理的機能上和精神的活動上，無非女子比較男子是劣等的。但此意見，叵就原始的人類生活的歷史上考察，實已早被許多的社會學者駁倒了，似乎用不着我再多述；單就現代的運動界，勞動界和航空界等中略略的看去，有時那些勇壯的女子，往往能夠駕凌男子的能力之上。因此我以爲今後的女子，只要能被解放到和男子完全的站在同一的水平線上時，則世間所有男子能夠做的，女子没有不能做的道理吧。</p>
<p>卽以女子爲航空家的這種大胆的行爲和冒險的精神看起來，已不能確認伊們畢竟是弱者，更不能否認伊們有此特殊的天賦。有某航空學校的敎師曾說，女學員的技術，常常的比男學員的好。又據報告，最近有一個二十四歲的美國女子，伊于二十五分鐘内明白了關於發動機和汽囊上的一切必要的事項；而且只受過六小時的實地指導已能自已駕機凌空了。</p>
<p>這樣看來，則將參加這次第十届世界亞林比克運動大會的美國西雅圖地方的海倫·麥迪遜小姐，以今年只有十八歲的芳齡，已于游泳界中創造十六項世界紀錄，因此博得世界游泳界的第一奇女子之稱，並謂其對一切運動爲男運動員所不及，也就不足怪了。此外又如倫海·虎爾斯女士，在世界網球界中也是大名鼎鼎的一人。如此則從來所謂女子的能力，生來不及男子的强壯之說，恐怕在這新時代的前面已漸漸的站不住脚了。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙棲記（九九）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第十二回　查前任判官司公開法價　策羣力建私宅各有人情　　鄔四爺聽得開胃。登時竟忘記了這吳師爺還是個漢好。反引爲唯一腹心。替他另向安胡二位引見。并隨即邀集大家。快同到縣衙裏去辦事。安玉田雖不應過問這查辦案件。但因與胡式德合作。爲人即所以爲已。理當同去一趟。爲胡式德撑撑塲面。兼顯顯自已的威風。况且他還知李品齋就是李問霞的父親。這老兒頑固成性。刻薄寡恩。向來招惹過他的憎惡。故此很願意來帮胡式德收拾這老東西當時帶領全部人馬。威風凛凛的徒步闖進那座空洞的縣衙。早有三班六房衙役人等。全站好了班在轅門外迎接。只是看那衙門的光景。却十分悽慘荒凉。大門外一扇照壁。石灰剝落得光怪陸離。露出了許多傲骨崚嶒般的磚石。東西轅門兩座牌坊。破爛歪斜。搖搖欲墜。一對石獅子斷脰折肢。也患了多年的殘疾。一路從大門進儀門登了大堂。所踏的是湫濕污穢的道路。所見的是灰敗凋零的屋子。門衰户落。楝折榱崩。連屋瓦上都長了亂蓬蓬幾尺長的茅草。說它是深山古廟還有點像。說它是一縣的官衙。竟一窮至此。也就難怪一般貪官污吏們都要做餓煞鬼了。由大堂再轉到後面的簽押房。地方上紳士也早來了有幾位在這兒恭候。鄔進祿原自認得他們的。就一一介紹姓名。并一同坐下來開了個臨時會議。這般人最會打死老虎。自然異口同聲。都紛紛訴說前任李品齋的劣跡。有一位老紳士指著牆上笑說道。那位李老爺眞是胆大包天。目無法紀。要錢比要命還凶。自從上任以來。一切民刑訴誣。不問是非曲直。只計較誰肯送錢和誰送的錢多。敞開了向打官司的老百姓講價。各位若不信。這裏就有他手訂的各種價目表。堂而皇之的貼在牆壁上。安玉田聽得奇怪。忙立起來走　去細看。果見有半張虎皮箋。像一幅橫額那麽張貼著。上面一行行寫著寸楷。字體還與魏碑彷彿。寫得極其古雅有力。乍看去還幾乎是一張名人墨蹟。</p>

<h3>經咒救國</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>自一二八事變以來，救國的聲浪甚高，或謂麻雀救國，或謂跳舞救國，或謂戀愛救國，但多是滑稽而諷刺的論調，現在的經咒救國，到是一部救國經的正文正傳。</p>
<p>昨據世界新聞社訊，中央委員戴傳賢李濟深及在野名流孫洪伊等，發起在北平雍和宮，起建密敎金光明道塲，以祈息災弭亂，轉移刧運，因爲國家多難，災患洊臻，没有辦法，而欲借佛法以普渡衆生，這也可算無聊之極了。</p>
<p>募捐啓中的大意，謂唐開元之治，歸功於密宗大師善年畏，日本之强，歸功於弘法大師留學於不空大師弟子惠果之門，倘果然佛法無邊，能夠救國，則產生佛敎的印度，何以先亡於不列巅三島之手呢？這種說法，我絶對不敢深信。</p>
<p>但治國，有治國的大法，有治國的常經，古人所謂『天下爲公，選賢爲能，』無論中外古今，不能逃此公例。若以天下爲已物，親戚爲腹心，祗有個人的主張，决不容他人的主張，祗有個人之權利，决不容他人的權利，這種家天下的治物，已成過去的歷史，無論何人，不能相助而理。</p>
<p>例如一個病人，至於諸醫束手，奄奄垂斃，家人計無所出，於是想到一種袪除外邪之法，恐怕「五怪」「騰蛇」「落水周太爺」等等作怪，呌幾個道士太保來做做，但這病到底是眞病，與外邪不相干的，還是去請幾個有本領的醫生來看看才對。</p>

<h3>藍曬紙之製法</h3>
<p>— 爾誠</p>
<p>藍曬紙的用途藍曬紙Blueprintingpaper是一種經過藥液塗過的紙張，牠一見了强光，在紙上的藥液，先變紅色，再變青色，於是便深的印在上面，雖放到水裏去洗滌，亦不退色，不過未經日光曬的藍曬紙，一遇着水，便將淡綠色的藥液完全洗去，我們利用這個作用，便拿來曬圖樣，印照片，所以現在各工程局的工程圖，都是用藍曬紙印成的，惟此紙都是外貨，我國雖有倣製，尙不普及，且用量不多時，以自製爲廉，因此我來把牠的製法寫出，以供與我同好者之研究與改良。</p>
<p>原料　　檬淡輕鐵FerriaminoniumCttrate九錢赤血鹽PotassiumFerricyanid八錢草酸飽和液（以草酸溶於水内至不能溶爲度）五錢阿摩尼亞五分清水六兩</p>
<p>製法　以上藥品備就後，以清水三雨化　檬淡輕鐵，又以清三兩化赤血鹽，再和以如上分量之草酸飽和液與阿摩尼亞，（由余試騐草酸液與阿摩尼亞不加亦可用）分貯於黃色瓶内，用時在暗處以此二瓶液體，等分相和，用軟牙刷，或紗布蘸液塗於白色光潔之紙上，（如道林紙之類）置暗處陰乾，切勿見光即成，至於曬圖手續，可將有圖畫之透明玻璃紙或攝有物影的照相底片，放入鏡框中，在暗室内將藍曬紙塗藥的一面靠緊裝好，放日光下感光，待其變色，即可取下以清水洗滌凉乾，影像畢現，甚爲清晰。</p>

<h3>瘋人語</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>（一）　　他們都說我是瘋人，好罷，我就承認了罷。但是他們爲什麽不會覺察他們自已比我瘋得更加利害呢？他們日以繼夜的陰謀，陷害，咒咀，屠殺：：：這些，還不夠瘋狂嗎？</p>
<p>啊！人們都會知道盡力爲本身辯護的，尤其是那些吸血鬼！</p>
<p>（二）　　昨天我看見一個瘦弱的乞丐在極度憤恨的捉蟲子，當然是因爲蝨子吸了他的血液的原因。然而是否只是蝨子就吸吮得他如此瘦弱的呢？這是他不會知道的。我知道，我懂得那個原因，可是我不知道我要怎樣的告訴他。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>華貴的汽車在馬路上奔馳，留下許多剩餘的油漬，在我看去，那都殷紅的血汁，殷紅的血計！</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>清道夫因爲穿了國旗色的背心的原故，汽車，電車，馬車，高跟鞋，司迪克，：：：誰都不敢碰他。啊！偉大的國旗顏色。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>一個小螞蟻大槪是生活得過於憤怒，使力的在郭屠夫的手掌中嚙了一下，當然他毫不介意的便將牠結果了。這在他不過是一次生命的遊戲。</p>
<p>我雖然不爲那小生命悲苦，可是却爲牠怨恨：爲什麽牠只是單人獨馬的來輕易嘗試的呢？</p>
<p>唉！</p>
<h3>「皇家軍」與「中國人」</h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>拖着沉重的步武，在一個深夜，我從十分疲乏的工作中歸來，走到赫德路口，遠遠地望見黑壓壓的一羣人，聽到一陣陣嘈雜的聲音，好奇的心理馬上拖着我的脚走向前去。</p>
<p>當我走進那黑壓壓的人叢裏的時候，首先跳進我的眼簾的便是满地的血，三個醉薰薰的皇家水兵，正攢毆着一個人，當然，這個人便是我們大中華民國的同胞，｜不，半殖民地的一個奴隷，帝國主義者列强共同統治之下的一個亡國奴｜</p>
<p>强者的鐵蹄踏在弱者的背上，六隻巨大的拳頭在弱者的面上背上以及任何一部分痛毆，血從弱者的口角迸出，從頭上迸出，流在地上，殷紅，｜這是弱者的血，是悲壯的血，也是中華民族的血。</p>
<p>四週發出同聲的怒吼，「打：：打」！　　誰吼！誰吼便打誰，六只拳頭向四週揮來，人便如潮般的向後退。</p>
<p>那時血泊中的弱者已掙扎起來，打算去向所謂維持治安維持秩序維持公理與正義的ＸＸＸ作公理之訴訟，然而這也是强者所不許，「弱肉强食」便是公理，便是正義，你是殖民地的奴隷，挨打是活該！不服嗎？再打第二次，於是六隻巨大的拳頭以及六隻鐵蹄又在弱者的面上背上攢毆。</p>
<p>「噯喲」！這是弱者的呻吟，這呻吟直刺進了我的心。</p>
<p>四週又發出「打：；打」的怒吼聲，怒火在每一個人的心裏燃燒着，悲憤在每一個人的心裏激盪着，</p>
<p>這時悲憤之火燃燒得我渾身發顫，眼前火星亂飛，這禽獸我惟有咬牙切齒的駡！</p>
<p>終於强者輕輕地嘘着凱旋之歌揚長地走了，弱者也拖着悲哀的呻吟走了，羣衆也嘘出一口悲壯的氣散了，在死寂的馬路上只剩我一個人，和一堆殷紅的血！</p>
<p>望着血，我得着了啓示，這啓示是齒還齒，目還目，血賬，還得拿血洗清。</p>
<p>但我相信就在這殷紅的血泊裏，就在這四週的怒吼聲裏，歷史已爲你們掘好了墓門，你殘暴的禽獸，你壓迫者一羣，十二萬萬五千萬被壓迫的奴隷總有一日會敲響你們的套鐘。</p>
<p>這一幕悲壯的爭鬥更增加了我的信念，給予了我以動力，帶着十分的興奮，我也辭别了那一堆血，踏着寒霜似的月色歸來。</p>

<h3>何樂而不爲</h3>
<p>— 顏興</p>
<p>多時不見的友人王君，昨晚在南京路石路口碰到。他戴的是雪白捲邊草帽，穿的是嶄新華絲紗長袍，著的是紗鞋絲襪，一望而知他現在是很得意。</p>
<p>「ＭＲ·顏，好久不見了，你好呀！」他見了我之後，着先呌應著我。</p>
<p>「你是王ＸＸ嗎？假使你不呌應我，我幾乎認不得你了。你近來做些甚麽事情？得意啦？」我就立定了，這樣的問他。</p>
<p>『我現在在ＸＸ洋行裏做跑街，得意也無所謂得意。』他微笑地回答。</p>
<p>「喲！」我驚異的說：「ＸＸ洋行豈不是ＸＸ人所開的嗎？現在大家都在抵制Ｘ貨，你反而替他們推銷，你豈不是做了賣國賊嗎？」</p>
<p>『誰願意啦！也是環境逼迫我的呀！』他埀了頭輕輕的嘆了一口氣說：『去年我在ＸＸ實業社裏做櫃員，每月拿了十五只老洋，一天要做十一小時工作，弄錯了還要吃賠賬，所以每逢拿起工錢來，七折八扣是没有一定的，這些倒也</p>
<p>不要去管牠，因爲生活還能夠勉强維持過去。不料一二八事變猝起，當時人心惶惶，大家都向内地逃難，我們的經理，也因爲担不起各人生命的干係，所以吩咐我們｜小職員｜回家。我於是也回到我的故鄉｜嘉興｜去暫避。事平了，我就出來，不料公司竟藉口戰後商業蕭條，實行緊縮而不收。不得已只好借起了旅館，東托朋友西托戚，另行找事。等了二個多月，幾乎吃盡當光，好容易找到了這個事情。倘再不幹的話，我豈不是要做　三？那時遇到了親友，不要說解囊週濟，恐怕理也不來理我了｜就是國民政府，也不因我是個忠人而給我特别賞賜呀』！</p>
<p>「那末生意好嗎」？我再問他。</p>
<p>『以六十支紗而言，西洋貨現在要賣四百兩銀子一件；ＸＸ貨呢，比它便宜得多。我們貴國人是最要貪便宜的，生意那得不好。并且貨物是由ＸＸ保險裝運，在路上誰也不敢碰牠。我呢，除了三十兩銀子月薪外，兜去了一件紗，有二十兩銀子Commission,何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>「何樂而不爲」？「何樂而不爲」？我别了他，反覆的在想，所謂奸商，原來只貪便宜，只管賺錢，國家觀念很淡薄，即此一端，可槪其餘！</p>

<h3>On "Suppressing Bandits" and "Creating Bandits" (Three Essays)</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The reasons why bandits arise, the reasons why bandit forces grow, and the fact that bandits cannot be eradicated by military force are all well known. So, what is the true path to "bandit suppression"? I say it lies in "clarifying politics and stabilizing the people's livelihood." Please allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p>Recently, reports stated that Chiang Kai-shek, in his address to various military and political leaders in Kuling, said: "Suppressing the Communists cannot rely solely on military force. This time, the suppression of the Communists should use 70% political means and 30% military means. It is essential to have political solutions and get politics on the right track for the suppression of bandits to succeed. The most important thing in politics is to seek political clarity. To achieve political clarity, strict enforcement of rewards and punishments is essential."</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek has also stated that only by clarifying politics can "bandit suppression" succeed. However, clarifying politics is easier said than done. The biggest problem causing political chaos today is corruption and lack of integrity. Those in government who can maintain their integrity are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. From high-ranking government officials to local police, they generally only know to compete for personal gain, taking whatever they want from national funds without distinguishing between public and private. They exploit and oppress the people to the extreme. Selling official positions and openly accepting bribes, harming the people and ruining the country, are of no concern to them. For example, the public sale of opium has become an open secret, and the darkness of the tax bureaus is an undeniable fact. We only need to see that anyone who enters government service today becomes rich, with every penny and every item coming from the people and the blood and sweat of the people. Officials get fatter while the people get thinner; one family laughs while ten thousand families weep. Such dark politics are almost unprecedented in history. Therefore, when we talk about clarifying politics today, the most important first step is to thoroughly eliminate corrupt officials and build a clean government. Killing one corrupt official is more effective than mobilizing a division of bandit suppression troops. Rectifying the discipline of a division of troops, not defaulting on their pay, and rigorously training them so that they themselves do not become bandits is even more effective than mobilizing a hundred thousand bandit suppression troops. In today's situation, it is better to passively avoid "creating bandits" than to actively "suppress bandits," and punishing corruption and rectifying military discipline is precisely the way to cut off the source of bandits.</p>
<p>Secondly, as we have said before, bandits arise and their power grows because of the pressure of making a living. Today, the decline of the countryside and the difficulty of the peasants' livelihood have reached an extreme. This is true of the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, and Anhui, not to mention that Jiangnan and Zhejiang, which are known for being rich, are now also in a state of decline. Silk is a major product of Jiangnan and Zhejiang, but it has now plummeted and cannot be revived. Families raising silkworms have no way to make a living and often weep in despair. Furthermore, due to years of famine, people have difficulty obtaining food, and they can only hope for the supply of foreign rice. If a country that has always been known for being based on agriculture relies on foreign countries for food and clothing, then this is not only a serious rural problem, but also a matter of life and death for our nation. With the countryside declining rapidly, the number of people forced by livelihood to take risks is also increasing day by day. Therefore, there is no way to eradicate the root cause of bandits without stabilizing the people's livelihood. If we want to talk about stabilizing the people's livelihood, then we must first solve the rural problem.</p>
<p>In short, what is called "bandits" today is not so much due to the incitement of the Communist Party's political propositions, but rather due to political oppression and the drive of livelihood. If politics are not reformed and the people's livelihood is not stabilized, then even without Communist agitation, chaos will be unavoidable. The examples in history of Huang Chao, Li Zicheng, Zhang Xianzhong, and even the White Wolf Rebellion in the Yuan Shikai era, are all evidence of this. Therefore, "suppressing bandits" today is like ladling soup to stop boiling, while clarifying politics and stabilizing the people's livelihood is like removing the firewood from under the pot. "This time, the suppression of bandits must use 30% military means and 70% political means." We sincerely hope that the government will put its words into practice. We sincerely hope that these 70% of political measures can be seen in reality.</p>
<p>Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Committee Completes Takeover of National Central University</h3>
<p>Professors and Assistant Professors Form Salary Demanding Group</p>
<p>Government to Hold Screening Examination</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 3rd, the committee from the Ministry of Education tasked with taking over National Central University did not arrive at the school. The university's General Affairs Office sealed off all classrooms and a few offices, closing all side doors, leaving only the main entrance for entry and exit. The General Affairs Office notified all students on campus to leave the school, and the student dormitories will be sealed off on the 4th. Students on campus are carrying boxes and hiring cars to move elsewhere, and rickshaw drivers are making ten times their usual income. However, a few students, due to the distance of their homes, are unable to leave the school and are seeking consent to request a modification from the authorities to allow them to stay on campus. (Special Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Professors Decide on Salary Demanding Measures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 10 AM on the 3rd, the professors of National Central University held a salary demanding meeting at the school.

<h3>Lausanne Conference's Last Struggle</h3>
<p>Five-Nation Plan Repeatedly Revised and Delivered to German Representatives</p>
<p>Reconstruction Fund and Payment Conditions Ultimately Rejected</p>
<p>National Society, Lausanne, 2nd: The main committee members of the Lausanne Conference (excluding Germany) today agreed on a plan to be delivered to the German representatives tomorrow morning by Chairman British Prime Minister MacDonald. It is heard that the five nations have decided to demand that Germany contribute approximately 400 million Marks to a post-war reconstruction fund after the suspension period ends and economic recovery begins. It is expected that the guarantee terms sought by France for US debts will be removed, but there is an implicit method that if the US insists on debt repayment, it will be assumed that Germany will issue bonds to repay them. Therefore, the British delegation today expressed optimism, but also acknowledged that tomorrow will be a critical period, with the German response to be determined on this day. The details of the plan have been informally communicated to the German side this evening, and it is expected that Germany may not agree tomorrow. If this is the case, the five nations may be forced to use "the means of gentle persuasion". Otherwise, if there is significant progress, Germany may attend the plenary session of the main committee tomorrow evening. In addition, the Eastern European reparations group held its first meeting this afternoon, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Simon, to begin preparing a report.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 3rd: Since the opening of the reparations conference, British Prime Minister MacDonald has been working tirelessly, consulting with representatives from various countries separately, and also discussing everything with his cabinet ministers. He is often short of sleep at night and has gradually become thinner. His doctor strongly advised him not to overwork, but MacDonald ignored it. This morning at 8:30, he met with Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, and soon after, he met with German Chancellor Papen and Foreign Minister Neurath. Subsequently, he participated in the main five-nation committee meeting, and after a brief discussion, extended the meeting to 5:00 PM this evening. As expected, Germany has rejected paying 420 million Marks in European restoration funds and has rejected certain conditions regarding payment. It is now expected that negotiations will continue for another 24 hours. MacDonald declared that if necessary, he intends to stay one or two more days until Tuesday to ensure that the work of the conference can reach a conclusion.</p>
<p>Havas, Lausanne, 3rd: At 10:30 this morning, when representatives of the five creditor nations met, MacDonald reported on his recent meeting with the German Chancellor and ministers. MacDonald presented the draft resolution prepared by the creditor nations to the German cabinet members. The full text of the draft contains twelve articles, totaling two pages, but the issue of allocating German payments has not been included in the draft, as all nations agreed that this should be managed by the creditor nations. After reading the draft, the German Chancellor and his ministers declared to MacDonald that the conditions proposed by the creditor nations to the German government are too harsh. If the current German government accepts them, the results of the next parliamentary election will inevitably lead to the National Socialist Party or the Communist Party coming to power. The German cabinet members requested to discuss the matter further with their delegation. MacDonald will meet with the German ministers again this afternoon, and MacDonald requested that the five nations' representatives remain in Lausanne so that these representatives could participate in the meeting chaired by him this evening.</p>
<h3>British and French Agree to Three-Year Extension</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 2nd: The gloomy situation in Lausanne took a sharp turn today after a week, and has become optimistic. The representatives of the creditor nations are now convinced that the reparations conference has a good chance of success. This optimism is the result of a compromise among the creditor nations regarding the difficulties between creditor nations. It is generally expected that Germany can agree on the scope, almost without a doubt, and therefore the door to the world conference will soon be open. British Prime Minister MacDonald, Minister of Commerce Runciman, French Prime Minister Herriot, and Finance Minister Martin held discussions all day and finally agreed on a plan to be submitted to the German representatives, which includes extending Germany's suspension period for three years, and then repaying after the International Clearing Bank determines Germany's ability to repay annual payments. The main difference in opinion among British and French politicians in the discussion was the amount of European restoration funds to be repaid by Germany, but this difficulty has finally been resolved. Both Britain and France have declared that all points have been agreed upon. It is heard that the amount of European restoration funds that Germany must repay has been set at around 400 million Marks.</p>
<h3>Main Reason for the Difficult Birth of the New Plan</h3>
<p>National Society, Lausanne, 2nd: The Lausanne reparations conference seems to be in its final struggle. The German representatives are currently awaiting the delivery of the final concrete plan from the five major creditor nations. The reason for the delay in delivering the plan, which could have arrived at the German delegation today, is nothing more than: (1) after Germany learned the content of the plan in advance, it expressed extreme opposition, leading to the plan being revised twice and still not finalized; (2) the creditor nations still have disagreements, with significant disputes between Britain and France. Both of these reasons are extremely difficult to conceal, and are considered to be the main reason for the difficult birth of the final plan.</p>
<h3>Germany Reiterates Inability to Bear the Burden</h3>
<p>National Society, Lausanne, 2nd: Today, German Foreign Minister Neurath met with British Prime Minister MacDonald once. During the meeting, Neurath stated that the new plan's wording was vague and could not be considered a permanent solution to a major problem. Since the recovery of the European economy depends on the successful outcome of this conference, the new plan has no hope of promoting the development of the European economy. Later, when discussing the characteristics of the plan, the German Foreign Minister reiterated that according to the new plan, Germany should spend a huge amount of money, approximately between 500 million and 700 million Marks. However, given the state of Germany's domestic finances, it would be difficult to raise this huge amount of money, even with a long period of extension. Furthermore, the German Foreign Minister stated that Germany cannot agree with the recent suggestion of linking reparations and war debts. After meeting with Neurath, MacDonald immediately convened representatives of the five creditor nations that evening to discuss how to eliminate the differences among the creditor nations so that there would be a united response to Germany's opposition. However, after a long period of discussion, no results were achieved, so the meeting was postponed until the next day. French Prime Minister Herriot returned to Paris immediately after the meeting adjourned, and French Finance Minister Germain Martin took over the affairs of the French delegation in Herriot's absence.</p>
<h3>Points of Disagreement between Britain and France</h3>
<p>It is heard that the current points of disagreement between Britain and France are roughly that France believes that the creditor nations should first have guarantees so that France has something to rely on in case negotiations to revise the war debt agreement with the United States fail. Furthermore, France believes that the word "United States" should be removed from the guarantee conditions and replaced with "world settlement", meaning that if a world settlement can be reached, France is willing to reduce the European economic reconstruction fund it should provide by half. However, since the war debt issue is still uncertain, France has no choice but to demand a minimum amount of approximately 600 million Marks from Germany. This amount is the most France can reduce. The British side believes that France should not insist on the establishment of guarantees, as this would make it impossible for the conference to proceed and would also cause disputes among nations. Furthermore, according to the views of the British delegation, since the United States is awaiting the success of the reparations conference, if the European nations can reach a reasonable understanding on the reparations issue, the United States may adopt a more moderate attitude from this point on, but will not be coerced into making concessions by any country. This is the general disagreement between Britain and France.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Conference Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>Therefore, observing the prospects for the reparations conference, it is felt that it is difficult to have a satisfactory outcome. Even from the British side, those who insisted on an optimistic attitude in the past now feel the darkness of the future and are showing anxiety. As for France's attitude, it has been pessimistic from beginning to end, and its anger has been increasing day by day. For example, French Finance Minister Germain Martin even said, "Germany has no other intention but to default on its debts."</p>
<h3>Investigation Group Arrives in Japan</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Shimonoseki, 3rd: Sir Lytton and his party, the League of Nations investigation group who came to Japan via Korea, arrived here on the Changgyeong Maru from 釜山 at 7:30 this morning. Many local officials and residents welcomed them. After resting briefly at the Sanyokan, they departed for Tokyo on a special train leaving at 8:45 AM. Lytton told reporters that the schedule for his stay in Japan has not yet been decided, but he plans to return to Peiping after important matters are completed. As for what matters will be discussed with Japan, or requests for Japan to submit a solution to the Manchurian problem, there are currently no concrete plans.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: The Japanese government has appointed former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Nagai as the chairman of the committee to receive the investigation group.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: The schedule for the investigation group's stay in Japan has been decided by the Japanese Foreign Ministry and Hasu, who arrived in Japan earlier. The general outline is as follows: Arrive in Tokyo on the 4th, stay at the Imperial Hotel; have an audience with the Japanese Emperor on the 5th, followed by a visit to Prince Chichibu, and then visit Prime Minister Saito; meet with Foreign Minister Uchida on the 6th; attend a dinner party hosted by Prince Chichibu at the Akasaka Detached Palace on the 7th; meet with influential figures in the Foreign Ministry, political circles, and financial circles from the 8th onwards. The stay will last approximately three weeks, and the location for drafting the report is scheduled to be in Hakone.</p>
<h3>Japan's Recognition of the Puppet State is Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Japan Federation News, Tokyo, 3rd: Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai visited Army Minister Araki yesterday afternoon and spoke for two hours. The content mainly discussed the issue of recognizing the puppet state of Manchukuo and the four-head political system. As a result, it was decided that once Uchida takes office as Foreign Minister, the procedures for recognizing the puppet state will be initiated immediately.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: The Japanese government is currently waiting for Uchida to take office as Foreign Minister before studying the established policy of opposing the League of Nations regarding China and Manchuria. Afterwards, it will establish a fixed and unchanging general policy and announce it to China and foreign countries. The content of the declaration is as follows: (1) Absolutely recognize the independence of Manchukuo and provide it with active assistance; (2) Eliminate obstacles to the independence of Manchukuo; (3) For national defense industries and everything else, Japan and Manchuria will absolutely cooperate. The above briefly notes its end. In order to achieve this, many advocates express their determination to eliminate all kinds of obstacles. As for the timing of the publication of this policy, some say that it should be announced to China and foreign countries at the same time as expressing Japan's determination to the investigation group, while others say that it should be done before expressing determination to the investigation group. Therefore, this statement is divided into two factions, and the government departments are currently deliberating.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: The All-Party Joint Association for National Consensus on the Manchurian Issue, organized by enthusiastic members of the political and civil sectors, enthusiastic members of the House of Peers, the Manchuria-Korea Association, veterans, the East Asia League, and more than a dozen other organizations, has scheduled a national convention for the immediate recognition of Manchukuo at 12:00 noon on the 9th at the Hibiya Public Hall. From the Seiyukai side, Yozo Matsuoka, and from the Minseito side, Katsu Kawasaki, etc., will attend and give speeches, and will also conduct publicity in various parts of the city at the same time.</p>
<h3>Traitor Ting Actually Recognizes an Enemy as a Father and Comforts Japanese Wounded Soldiers</h3>

<h3>US Democratic Presidential Candidate Accepts the Entire Platform</h3>
<p>Adopts a Moderate Policy</p>
<p>Restores World Friendship</p>
<p>Garner Nominated as Vice Presidential Candidate</p>
<p>National Society, Chicago, 2nd: The Democratic National Convention concluded today after electing Garner as the candidate for Vice President, listening to the speech of presidential candidate Roosevelt, and electing Farley as the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Roosevelt arrived here at 5:50 PM today by plane from the capital of New York State, accompanied by his wife, and immediately went to the convention to give a speech, declaring that he accepted the Democratic Party platform without reservation, and stated that he supported Congress directly lifting the ban on alcohol. He said that the Democratic Party's platform is not radical, and he does not support radicalism as a means of resolving difficulties. He asked Republicans who are dissatisfied with the current situation to join hands with the Democrats to improve the national situation. Later, regarding the tariff issue, Roosevelt claimed that the Republican Party surrounded the country with barbed wire, resulting in isolation. The Democratic Party platform adopts a protective tariff, but it is sufficient to correct its ills and restore world friendship. Roosevelt discussed the platform item by item, expressing his support for each one. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Japanese Flood Losses</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: Due to continuous rain, floods are reported everywhere. In the Kyoto area, the Togetsukyo Bridge in Arashiyama was washed away by more than three jo at 5:30 PM yesterday due to the rising water of the Oi River. The water volume increased further at dusk, and some residential houses were flooded. In the Shizuoka area, the Tenryu River rose by one jo and two shaku, and the Tenryu Bridge collapsed and was washed away by approximately two jo. Restoration will take approximately ten days. According to the subsequent investigation of the flood damage in Miki Town, Mino County, Kobe, 80% of the more than 1,930 households were flooded, 40 households were washed away, 21 people died, 11 people are missing, and the damage is estimated at approximately 500,000 yen. In the Banshu area, such as the civil engineering projects in Hyogo Prefecture, the amount of damage has exceeded one million yen. The torrential rain in Aichi Prefecture near Nagoya began to subside yesterday afternoon, but the flood damage is greater than expected. The detailed situation cannot be determined due to transportation disruptions, but the area most severely affected is the Yabiki River basin, including Nishikamo, Nukada, Hekikai, and Hazu Counties, where 23 people died, 80 people were injured, more than 1,150 cho of rice fields were flooded, and more than 3,000 households were flooded.</p>
<h3>A Parisian Beauty</h3>
<p>Charged as a Russian Spy and Arrested</p>
<p>Important Documents Searched Out</p>
<p>National Society, Paris, 2nd: French authorities have arrested a beautiful French woman who is said to be under the order of the Soviet Russian General Staff to specialize in private military intelligence in France. The woman's original surname was Pierre, but she changed it to Vandome. She is extremely beautiful and good at socializing, and was once regarded as a social star, but her behavior is mysterious, which aroused the suspicion of the authorities. After a secret investigation, it was discovered that she was the leader of Soviet Russian military spies in France, and had many followers who obeyed her commands. Since the woman's arrest, eight people have been arrested one after another, including an editor of the Communist Party's organ newspaper, Humanité. It is also heard that the authorities have searched out many extremely important documents from the woman and her accomplices, the contents of which are being kept secret. It is expected that this case will have surprising developments.</p>

<h3>Former King of Portugal Dies Suddenly from Laryngitis</h3>
<p>National Society, London, 2nd: Former King Manuel II of Portugal died suddenly from acute swelling of the throat at his residence in Twickenham at 2:30 PM today, at the age of 42. According to reports, the former King of Portugal was still happily chatting with the former King of Spain while watching the tennis match at Wimbledon yesterday. He had originally arranged to attend the match again this afternoon, but suddenly received a telegram at 1:30 PM stating that the former King's throat condition would be postponed. Unexpectedly, news of his death came an hour later. The King ascended the throne on February 1, 1908, and was deposed in 1910 when the Portuguese revolution declared a republic.</p>
<h3>Famous Singer Sues Russian Authorities for Reprinting His Work and Demands 2 Million Francs in Damages</h3>
<p>National Society, Paris, 2nd: Famous singer Chaliapin sued the Soviet Russian government in the Paris court, claiming that the Russian authorities had reprinted his autobiography without permission and demanded that the Soviet Russian Trade Representative in Paris be ordered to pay 2 million francs in damages. The trial opened in the civil court today. The courtroom was filled with White Russians. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that Chaliapin deposited the draft of his autobiography, written in 1917, with his friend, Russian writer Gorky, which was then searched and confiscated by the Soviet Russian authorities, who then reprinted and sold it without permission, and translated it into several languages, thereby claiming copyright infringement. The defendant's lawyer claimed that the case was not under the jurisdiction of the French court and requested dismissal. The trial was then adjourned for continuation.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Puppet State Forcibly Occupies the Binjiang Customs</h3>
<p>The Commissioner of Customs Leads Staff to Withdraw</p>
<p>All Customs Offices are Guarded by Puppet Police</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Customs Has Telegraphed Peking for Instructions</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Following the Puppet State's forcible takeover of the Dalian Customs, the local Customs here was also forcibly taken over by the Puppet State on June 26. On the 25th, the local Puppet State Administrative Commissioner's Office received an order from the Puppet State Ministry of Finance, ordering the immediate takeover of the Binjiang Customs. At approximately 2:00 PM on the 26th, Ba Ying-e, the Puppet Binjiang Customs Superintendent, accompanied by Hirata, a Japanese advisor to the Puppet Commissioner's Office, and numerous armed security teams from the Puppet Special Police, arrived at the Nangang Customs by car. After getting out of the car, the police guarded the front and back doors and the residence of the Swiss Commissioner of Customs, Puder, in the backyard. It was a Sunday, and the Customs officials were not present. The Japanese advisor and Ba Ying-e immediately occupied the Commissioner of Customs' office and sealed off the official documents and files. At this time, Commissioner of Customs Puder was out on business. His family found him by telephone, and he rushed back by car, entered to see Hirata, and questioned the reason for the sudden takeover. He said that he was formally appointed by the Chinese government and that the Customs was related to the loan guarantee, and that no one could come to take over before receiving an order. He also demanded that the police be withdrawn immediately. Hirata refused, saying that the Manchurian Customs would be managed by the Manchurian State from tomorrow onwards. If he wanted to stay on, he would sign a treaty and still be allowed to serve as the Commissioner of Customs, with all the same treatment as before, otherwise he would have to leave this place. Puder, unable to negotiate, withdrew. At 3:30 PM, under Hirata's command, the Puppet State flag was raised on the roof of the Customs, and people were sent to monitor everything in the Customs. At the same time, the wharf station branch offices at the Jiangbin Pier were also guarded inside and out by a large team of police and personnel from the Detective Bureau, to prevent Customs officials from stealing documents and holding meetings. Ba Ying-e also issued a declaration in the name of the Superintendent to all Customs officials, saying that they should continue to work as usual, with all the same treatment as before. However, all Customs officials who were outside that evening went to the US Consulate to meet with Commissioner of Customs Puder and ask for instructions. Puder then invited the consuls related to foreign debt, in the name of Deputy Commissioner of Customs Bailey Wood, at 9:00 PM in the US Consulate. The consuls of the United States, France, Britain, and Germany all attended and discussed for a long time, and have already discussed countermeasures. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 AM. At 2:00 AM on the 27th, Puder sent a long telegram to Nanjing via Vladivostok. Before Nanjing made a clear statement on countermeasures, Puder led all Chinese and foreign Customs officials to cease performing their duties and sealed off all ports and wharves. In order to prevent Chinese Customs officials from being forced to perform their duties, all officials were divided among the homes of friends to temporarily seek safety. Therefore, on the 27th, all Customs offices were closed, and not even a laborer reported to work. The Japanese side had originally declared that after the takeover, business could be conducted as usual, but this was ultimately not realized. Kato Tatsushiro, the Japanese advisor to the Puppet Customs Superintendent's Office, had gone to Changchun a few days ago to ask for instructions. He returned to Harbin early on the 27th. When the Commissioner of Customs refused to take over, he discussed countermeasures with key Japanese figures in Harbin that evening. It is heard that there are plans to summon White Russians and Japanese to forcibly open the Customs first. It has been investigated that the Binjiang Customs has three branch offices under its jurisdiction: one in Manchuria, one in Suifenho, and one in Lahasusu (i.e., Tongjiang). It collects 7 million taels of customs duties annually. Now that the Binjiang Customs has been forcibly taken over, the Manchuria Customs was also forcibly occupied on the same day. The Customs officials were few and could not resist, and most of them withdrew. The Puppet State sent people to take over the Lahasusu Customs, but they have not yet arrived. The Suifenho Customs is in the self-defense army's territory, and the Japanese side has not dared to send people there (evening of the 27th).</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Summons Henan Gentry</h3>
<p>And Receives All Provincial Committee Members for Work Inquiries. Hankou Correspondence: General Commander Chiang Kai-shek previously instructed Pacification Director He Chengjun to invite Zhang Nanxian, former Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, to Hankou to consult on disaster relief. Zhang arrived in Hankou on the 1st from Wuyang. On the morning of the 2nd, at 10:00 AM, accompanied by He Chengjun, he went to the headquarters. Chiang immediately received him. Zhang had deeply engaged with the people, cooperated with local authorities in suppressing the Red bandits and handling post-disaster affairs. Therefore, upon meeting Chiang, he presented several points, many of which were pertinent. Chiang greatly praised him. After Zhang left, Chiang also received Fang Benren, Chairman of the Anti-Communism Promotion Association, and inquired about related matters. At 4:00 PM, Chiang, at his residence in Yihua Village, summoned all members of the provincial government. Those present included Chairman Xia Douyin, Civil Affairs Director Zhu Huaibing, Construction Director Li Shucheng, Finance Director Shen Zhaonian, Education Director Shen Shiyuan, Committee Members Kong Geng, Yan Xunfu, Cheng Ruhui, and others. After receiving them, Chiang first inquired about the progress made by each department in the work plan set during the Lushan Conference for the period of bandit suppression. For example, in civil affairs: the census, militia training, and land survey; in construction: the laying of power lines and road repairs. Xia and the department directors reported in detail. The meeting lasted a considerable time. Chiang instructed all committee members to be particularly cautious in selecting county magistrates, stating that magistrates should have the determination to either live or die with the city. Under no circumstances should they abandon their posts or flee the city in the event of a bandit attack; otherwise, they must be severely punished as a warning to others, ensuring the safety of the people. At the same time, Chiang noted that the county magistrate of Guangji County, Dong Xiangxun, was attending a transportation conference in Hankou when the county was captured by bandits, which was not his fault. He specifically ordered the Pacification Commissioner's Office to exempt him from punishment. Furthermore, Chiang stated that Hubei Province had suffered repeated bandit attacks, leaving the villages desolate. Most of the local elders had fled to Wuhan, leaving the people without guidance and society without a center. He specifically ordered the provincial government to instruct the Department of Civil Affairs to recommend gentry from each county to assist in suppressing bandits and handling post-disaster affairs. The Department of Civil Affairs had already submitted the names of fifty-two people, including Zhang Nanxian. On the 2nd, at 1:00 PM, Civil Affairs Director Zhu Huaibing invited Zhang and others to the department to discuss everything in advance, so that Chiang could consult them when he summoned them on the 3rd. It is expected that Zhang and others will organize a Party and Government Committee or a Political Affairs Bureau, dividing the province into five districts, each with a committee dedicated to handling anti-communism and post-disaster relief. Detailed measures will be fully decided after Chiang receives them on the 3rd. (July 7, 2)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Northeast K</h3>
<p>(3) Creating a New Continent - A Crucial Necessity (Continued from Part 2)</p>
<p>(5) The Japanese had long desired to complete the Manchurian and Mongolian railway network, especially the Jihui Railway, and had demanded five new Manchurian and Mongolian railways. Now that the Northeast is under their control, they can naturally do whatever they want without any scruples. The Japanese have signed contracts with the puppet government of Jilin for the Dunhua-Tumen, Changchun-Dalian, and Laha-San routes, with a loan of 50 million Japanese yen. However, last year's survey results indicated that the Dunhua-Tumen and Laha routes would be started first, while the Changchun-Dalian route would be temporarily postponed. However, construction on the Dunhua-Tumen line has been slow due to the constant activities of Wang Delin's Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>The Dunhua-Tumen line is part of the completion of the Jihui Railway. In the future, it will connect to Dama in the west and Xiongji Port in the east, running entirely parallel to the Chinese Eastern Railway. Xiongji is about to replace Vladivostok. From Laha, it connects to Harbin via Laqing, from Wencheng to Hailin, and up the Mudan River to the Songhua River. From Tao'an, it connects to Ang'angxi, effectively cutting the Chinese Eastern Railway into three sections. The transport of goods southward will be diverted: the Laha line will take 60%, and the Tao'an-Ang'angxi and Hai-Wencheng lines will each take 20%. In this way, the Chinese Eastern Railway will become virtually useless, and the rich resources of Northern Manchuria will be seized by the Japanese.</p>
<p>A railway has already been built from Hailin via Ning'an to Dongjingcheng. Zhongcheng is very close to Wencheng, and connecting it will allow access to Chongjin Port. The construction of the Dunhua-Ning'an project is estimated to cost 20 million Japanese yen. Although the distance from Hailin to Wencheng is similar to that from Dunhua to Ning'an, the terrain is mountainous, making construction difficult, and is estimated to cost 30 million Japanese yen. An engineering bureau has been established in Yanji and is laying tracks. It is expected to be open to traffic in October.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, the recent plans of the Japanese, that is, the Jihui Railway, leaving aside military aspects and focusing on economics, aim to develop Jilin and can be divided into the main line and feeder lines as follows (please refer to the map, where all dashed lines indicate roads that have not yet been built):</p>
<p>Main Line South Line | Chongjin Hoiryeong Hwaryong Ryongjeong Village</p>
<p>Dongfosi Dunhua North Line | Woonggi Wencheng Yanji Dongfosi Dunhua Feeder Line Ning-Dun Line | Ning'an Shalan Town Erzhan Tala Station Kaoshan Dunhua Hai-Wen Line | Hailin Ning'an Dongjingcheng Yisong Xiaosongzi Sancha Pass Dawangqing Ga Yahe Huimodong Wencheng</p>
<p>Here, it seems necessary to mention the Tumen-Binshan Railway. This road runs from Tianbin Mountain to the Tumen River, 111 kilometers long, and connects to the railway from Chongjin to Hoiryeong in Korea, which is essentially the eastern section of the Jihui Railway. In the past, Japanese merchants built it under the guise of mining. It was opened to traffic in 1924. Because it is a light railway, the tracks are very narrow. If it is to be used, it must be widened. The Japanese are still studying this due to financial constraints. However, in any case, this road will become part of the assets of the Jihui Railway.</p>
<p>Yanji is designated by the Japanese as an area for group colonization, hoping to integrate Korea and Jilin. Therefore, they have conducted detailed surveys of the cultivated land along this road. These are listed below for reference:</p>
<p>County Name Cultivable Land (mu) Cultivated Land (mu) Transportation Absorption Rate (%)</p>
<p>Dunhua 309,485 58,750 100 EMu 216,672 50,889 80 Antu 140,212 7,628 20 Huadian 256,891 109,733 30 Yanji 273,189 157,168 100 Wangqing 160,022 43,828 100 Hwaryong 140,916 47,280 30 Hunchun 30,293 24,424 80 Total 1,607,680 499,700</p>
<p>(6) The Guandong section of the Jingfeng Railway, now known as the Beining Railway, is 427 kilometers long. It was proposed by Li Hongzhang to develop the Northeast and consolidate national defense. It was opened to traffic in 1894. In 1898, to add the Beipiao branch line, a loan of 2.3 million pounds was obtained from the Chinese and British Corporation, repayable over 42 years from 1902. In 1921, to rebuild the double track, another 500,000 pounds and 2 million silver dollars were borrowed. Therefore, including principal and interest, 7,920 pounds should be repaid monthly. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese thought of getting involved, but because of the British interests involved, they found it difficult to do so. Then, they suddenly had a flash of inspiration and followed the precedent of the Fengyu Railway, intercepting the section from Shenyang to Shanhaiguan, adding the branch lines of Lianshan, Jinzhou, Goubangzi, and Dahushan, renaming it the Fengshan Road, and appointing Guan Duo as the director. They also forcibly occupied part of the Shanhaiguan station as a ticket office and waiting room. Initially, due to military reasons, passengers had to change trains in Jinzhou. Since April 1st, express trains have been running directly, and the business transportation regulations have been completely changed to follow the South Manchuria Railway. All receipts and documents must be reviewed by the Japanese Kojima. However, because this road is connected to the section inside the pass, and the Volunteer Army is springing up along the way, passengers must get off the train for inspection in Suizhong. At other stations, there are Japanese soldiers and members of the so-called "Commercial Maintenance Association" boarding the train to seek out those they deem suspicious. If there is any hesitation in their speech, they must taste the flavor of iron bars. The inspection focuses on three items:</p>
<p>(1) Firearms and ammunition;</p>
<p>(2) Undesirable elements and those secretly communicating information;</p>
<p>(3) Unjust propaganda and printed materials.</p>
<p>Regulations are also stipulated to hinder railway safety, and offenders will be punished more severely:</p>
<p>(1) Anyone who steals road nails or wood is treated as a public danger crime, unlike ordinary theft.</p>
<p>(2) Those who damage roadbeds and sleepers will be subject to severe imprisonment.</p>
<p>(3) Those who place dangerous objects that cause accidents to the train will be subject to the most severe imprisonment or the death penalty.</p>
<p>Also, fearing that railway police will be used by others, the number is restricted from 1,700 to 1,200, and 200 White Russians are recruited and trained in Goubangzi in order to gradually replace them. The bridges in the Xinmin, Liuhe, and Xingcheng areas are guarded by peasant-style plainclothes soldiers under the command of Japanese officers to prevent anyone from hijacking the train. The Japanese are trying to seize the road and have already prepared a budget for four fiscal years. From the first year of the puppet state Datong to the fourth year of Datong, special increases will be made to expenditures to ensure that it is unprofitable. At the same time, borrowing vehicles and materials from the South Manchuria Railway is a kind of disguised annexation. 18 locomotives and two passenger trains have already been rented. The special train prepared by the road for the League of Nations investigation team was also remodeled using South Manchuria Railway vehicles. Regarding the British loan, the Japanese have been paying it monthly since January, but the British must deal directly with the road. In the future, Japan will have creditor relations with the United Kingdom on this road, while the actual power will be in the hands of the Japanese, which is already obvious.</p>
<p>The Japanese are extremely opposed to the Huludao port construction related to this road. However, due to a contract with the Netherlands, if Japan comes forward to overturn it, it will inevitably cause international resentment. Therefore, they have now changed their policy and agreed to proceed as before. However, after completion, they will find ways to have the South Manchuria Railway Company operate it as a supplementary port to Dalian, so as not to become a competing port for Chinese railways.

<h3>Glimpse of Martial Law in Guangzhou Before Li Zongren Arrives in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Misinformation Spread That Li Zongren Leads Guangxi Troops to Guangdong</p>
<p>Chen Jitang Transfers Large Numbers of Troops Overnight to Defend</p>
<p>Three Key Air Force Personnel Replaced Afterwards</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: During this confrontation between the Guangdong Province’s land, air, and naval forces, Sun Ke and others suddenly went south from Shanghai, lingering in Hong Kong and Macau. There was much speculation here. Unexpectedly, Li Zongren, a powerful figure from Guangxi, suddenly arrived in Guangdong at this time. The rumors spread even more widely. Before Mr. Li arrived in Guangdong, Chen Jitang had a scare, causing a large-scale imposition of martial law on land and water in the normally peaceful city of Guangzhou. The citizens of Guangzhou felt especially uneasy. The incident stemmed from a report on June 27th from the Third Water Station of the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway Bureau, stating that a unit of the Fourth Army Group of Guangxi suddenly arrived at Hekou, Sanshui, and requested instructions on how to handle it. Chen Jitang, having not received any prior notice of Li Zongren leading troops to Guangdong, wondered why Guangxi troops suddenly arrived. He convened an emergency secret meeting at headquarters and then ordered troops stationed near the city and in the North River area to return to the province to defend it. He also ordered the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway Traffic Battalion to arrive at Shiwetang Station to guard it. On that day, the Guangzhou-Sanshui trains only ran to Xiaotang Station. Headquarters dispatched the Guangjin and Haihu warships to the Shiwetang River area, removed the gun covers, and pointed the guns towards the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway as a warning. At the same time, the Third Regiment of the Training Division stationed in Yantang, led by Chen Qijie, was transferred to Huangsha Station for sentry duty and deployment, erecting large cannons next to the station. Each sentry was armed with two grenades, as if facing a major enemy. On that day, headquarters also established military vehicle management offices at the Guangzhou-Sanshui, Guangzhou-Kowloon, and Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureaus, with two personnel assigned to each office. No trains were allowed to depart without orders from headquarters. In the morning, a Guangzhou-Kowloon train was ordered to go to Shilong to transport troops from Zhang Da's Fifth Division of the Second Army to the province for defense. The Luo Xiuli regiment of Zhang's division stationed in Huangpu was also ordered to go to the province and was stationed in the Henan area, with extremely strict security. The transportation of troops by the Guangzhou-Kowloon train ceased at 11:00 PM. A regiment of the Second Army stationed at Shipai on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was also transferred to the province to guard the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway. On the night of the 27th, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway dispatched trains to Yingde and Shaoguan to transport the First Regiment of the Training Division stationed in Yingde and the newly formed Third Independent Division stationed in Shaoguan back to the province. These two units received orders and arrived in the province on the 28th. The First Regiment of the Training Division, led by Luo Cequn, was stationed in Longyandong Yuanjiang Township in the suburbs for defense. The First Regiment of the newly formed Third Independent Division, led by Chen Boying, was stationed at Xicun Station awaiting orders. The remaining two regiments were transferred to Jiangcun Gaotang for stationing. Units currently being transferred also include Zhang Ruigui's Second Independent Division stationed in Shantou and the Fourth Aircraft Squadron stationed in Shantou. The troop movements from the 27th were completed. Upon further investigation, it was found that the Guangxi troops reported by Sanshui Station to have arrived in Sanshui on the morning of the 27th were actually a misidentification of Zhuang Menghong's Training Regiment of the First Army, returning from Zhaoqing. On the afternoon of the 26th, at 5:00 PM, an aircraft suddenly flew from the province to Zhaoqing, conveying an emergency order, instructing the regiment to depart for the province overnight. The regiment then set off at 12:00 PM that night, arriving in Sanshui by boat, which was mistaken for Guangxi troops by the Sanshui station staff. Moreover, Li Zongren also happened to be arriving in Guangdong along the river on that day. The station staff assumed that the training regiment was commanded by Li, hence the false report, causing the whole city of Guangzhou to be shaken. This shows the instability of the Guangdong situation. After the First Army's Training Regiment stationed in Zhaoqing arrived in Sanshui, they learned of the misunderstanding in the province and urgently telegraphed the authorities to explain. They then took a train to the province at around 2:00 PM on the 27th, arriving at Shiwetang at around 4:00 PM. They were then ordered to be stationed in Sanyuanli Township in the north of the city. The false alarm was finally clarified. However, the most bizarre thing was who dispatched the aircraft that conveyed the order to the training regiment to depart for the province that day. The headquarters of the First Army had no prior knowledge. It was heard that the aircraft landed at the Dongjiao Chang in Zhaoqing, with slight damage to the fuselage. It is still left in Zhaoqing. Afterwards, the Air Force Commander Huang Guangrui suddenly replaced three important officials in the aviation community. One was the replacement of Ning Mingjie, the commander of the Third Aircraft Squadron. Ning's unit had been stationed in Shaoguan, following Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army, to Jiangxi to suppress the Communists. On the 28th, Huang Guangrui reassigned Tao Zuode, the director of the air navigation department, to Shaoguan to take over the Third Aircraft Squadron. Another was the replacement of Deng Yueming, the commander of the Air Force Training Corps. The remaining aircraft of the training corps were handed over to the air navigation department for reorganization. Chen, a counselor of the department, was appointed to fill the vacancy of the director of the air navigation department. The third was the replacement of Yang Guanyu, the head of the aviation school. Zhou was appointed to fill the vacancy. Ning, Deng, and Yang were all veterans in the aviation community and were suddenly dismissed. Outsiders found it strange. According to the authorities, the reason for the dismissal of the three was that they were ineffective and derelict in their duties. After the turmoil subsided slightly, at around 6:00 AM on the 28th, Li Zongren arrived in the province lightly guarded by Guangzhou-Sanshui train. Only the personnel of the Fourth Army Group's office in Guangdong were waiting to welcome him at the station. Accompanying him were his wife, Chief of Staff Zhou Cong, Secretary Chen Yunbao, and others. After Li got off the train at Shiwetang Station, he took an electric ferry to the Huangsha Pier, disembarked, and transferred to a car, driving directly back to his residence on Mapenggang Road in the eastern suburbs. He then visited Chen Jitang to discuss ways to send troops to suppress the Communist bandits in Jiangxi. After a long time, he and Chen attended the Southwest Political Affairs Committee to discuss important issues of the current situation. The content was kept secret. According to Li's statement to others, the purpose of his visit to Guangdong was to coordinate the suppression of the Communist bandits in Jiangxi. Guangxi has indeed transferred two divisions, Zhou Zumian and Wang Zanbin, and concentrated them in Wuzhou awaiting orders. (June 29th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters Impeaches Hubei Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Alleging that the Provincial Administration Design Committee's organization infringes on Party rights</p>
<p>Xia Douyin also issues a statement explaining in detail</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters recently held a provisional meeting to address the remarks made by Han Yucheng of the Provincial Administration Design Committee that disparaged the Kuomintang, and to address the resolution to severely request the arrest and banning of individuals who organized a memorial service for Zhan Dabe and Li Hanjun. At the same time, they raised an impeachment against the Provincial Government's recent measures, planning to submit it to the Central Government for review. The original text of the resolution has been organized and published as follows: "The Supervisory Committee, in full committee, proposes: Since the reorganization of the Provincial Government, this Headquarters has repeatedly requested, in accordance with the Party Charter, that the policy guidelines be sent to this Headquarters for review. Several months have passed, and it has not been delivered. Recently, as the province's finances are exhausted, it has independently established the so-called Design Committee. The significance of its organization has not been submitted to this Headquarters for review. This already constitutes an infringement on Party rights and disrupts the organization. On the day of the committee's establishment, Design Committee member Han Yucheng openly disparaged the Party and insulted the President. Newspapers were rife with such reports, misleading the public. The Provincial Government Chairman and committee members were all present at the time but did not stop it or report it afterward. We should request that an impeachment be filed in accordance with the law to emphasize Party rule. Resolution passed." Hubei Provincial Government Chairman Xia Douyin also issued a statement to reporters, explaining the establishment of the Provincial Administration Design Committee. He stated, "Recently, there have been many suggestions regarding provincial administration. I was appointed by the Central Government to serve my hometown. Although I wish to strive to do my best, I am always troubled by my lack of talent and ability. I am extremely welcoming of any sincere words that are beneficial to the country. The establishment of the Provincial Administration Design Committee is to embody the spirit of the Central Government's convocation of the National Crisis Conference and the General Commander's respect for the gentry, to concentrate the will of all parties in order to seek the smooth implementation of government affairs. The committee is purely advisory and not an executive body. There is no conflict with Party regulations or government orders. The fact that one or two members have made inappropriate remarks was unforeseen, just as some members of the National Crisis Conference have made comments that exceeded the bounds of propriety. This cannot be blamed on the Central Government that convened the conference. The Anti-Smoking Committee was established by the previous Provincial Government in accordance with the National Anti-Smoking Committee regulations a long time ago. I have no preconceived notions. In short, I accepted Director He's recommendation and rashly assumed a difficult task, only seeking to have a clear conscience. I did not come to be an official. I am happy to accept any suggestions that can inspire me." (July 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Counterfeit Money Spreads Throughout Manchuria</h3>
<p>Most circulated in Dalian and Shenyang. Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, Shenyang Dispatch: According to a report from the Nagasaki Police Department, the Kwantungting Police Bureau recently learned that counterfeiters, based in Kyushu, counterfeited 3,000 ten-yen bills of the Bank of Japan. Of these, 2,000 had already been imported into Manchuria from Korea. According to reports, 2 million yuan worth of counterfeit money has been issued throughout Manchuria, with the most in Dalian, Shenyang, and other places. Countless people have been defrauded. All police stations in Manchuria have begun operations. In addition to arresting two criminals in Sinuiju, they have secretly ordered strict investigations in various places.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Returning from Shanghai Secretly Leak Military Secrets</h3>
<p>Nagoya Shimbun, Kanazawa Dispatch: At the end of May, soldiers from the Tsuruga 19th Infantry Regiment, who had returned victoriously from Shanghai, secretly informed a certain organization in the mainland of the military secrets, such as the troop strength of the Japanese army dispatched to Shanghai and the organization of the units. The organization then secretly informed a certain great power. This fact has been detected by the authorities, who secretly ordered the Tsuruga Military Police Detachment to arrest the criminals and detain them in the Kanazawa 9th Division. After a military trial by the 9th Division, they confessed to being in contact with a certain Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Sijing Business Association Telegraphs in Protest Against Special Business Tax: The Jiangsu Province's implementation of the Special Business Tax is harming both merchants and people. Although the ministry has issued a clear order to abolish it, the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department still intends to implement the collection starting on July 1st. The Sijing Town Business Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday (July 1st), protesting strongly: "Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Province's implementation of the Special Business Tax has caused panic among merchants and people throughout the province. The ministry has already approved the abolition of this Special Business Tax, which is no different from disguised likin, by the Executive Yuan. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department insists on its own way, still intends to implement it starting on July 1st at various key points on land and water. It ignores the orders of the Yuan and the ministry, and instead forces merchants to acknowledge illegal tax collection. Merchants will also follow suit and resist orders, which will further disrupt the political system. It is reported that the Shanghai and Wuxi business associations have stated that if the Special Business Tax is implemented, the consolidated tax and business tax must be suspended first. A great uproar is feared, with a momentum that cannot be suppressed. We therefore telegraph urgently, appealing to Your Excellency to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants and promptly issue a strict order to the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department to stop it in order to maintain political order and alleviate the suffering of Jiangsu merchants."</p>
<p>Water Police Capture Bandits and Escort Them to the District Department: Fan Guozhong, the captain of the First Team of the Provincial Public Security Water Police, received a report that bandits were lingering in the Longmiao area of Fenshui. He immediately supervised the Second Squad under his command to patrol. On the 2nd, they encountered the bandits at that location. The bandits opened fire in resistance, killing patrolman Li Jinfu. Three bandits were shot. One fell into the water and drowned. One escaped by swimming. Only Yang Guirong, from Xuzhou, was captured alive, along with two 79 rifles and 160 rounds of ammunition. According to his confession, he was involved in the firefight with the Fengjing Security Corps on July 30th. He has been escorted to the Minhang District Department for interrogation. Yesterday's report that two bandit criminals who killed corps members were captured and killed was actually an error.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Post Police Tragically Killed: The Public Security Bureau had a rear door post during Li Zongwang's term, located on Zhongshan Road, only a few dozen feet from the entrance to Zhongshan Park. The area was extremely quiet at night. Last night (the 1st), at around 8:00 PM, a post policeman, Wu Qi, was suddenly hacked to death by thugs with sharp blades, with two blows to the head, one to the left shoulder, and the left neck severed. He fell to the ground and died on the spot. A Browning pistol, serial number 641374, was snatched by the thugs. No one knew what happened at the time. It was not until 9:00 PM, when the replacement patrolman, Zhou Zhenshan, discovered it, that he reported it to the inspector and then to the county. The city gates were immediately closed, and all the police searched inside and outside the city overnight, but to no avail. Today (the 2nd), Magistrate Ma went to inspect the body himself, ordering the detectives under his command to solve the case within three days. Afterwards, the deceased's brother, Wu Cunyi, came to visit his brother and learned that he had been killed. He was very saddened. Because his brother was killed on duty, he requested that the government provide compensation to comfort his soul.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Financial Department Borrows Funds to Repair Provincial Dikes:  Shu Shifu, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, urgently needs funds for the repair of the province's regional dikes and has no means to pay for it. He has specially borrowed 400,000 yuan in cash from various banks in Shanghai, using the busy tax grains of Wuxian, Wujin, Wuxi, Changshu, and Songjiang counties for the 22nd year of the Republic of China as repayment. This has been submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for discussion and approval and reported to the relevant authorities. Both parties have signed a contract and delivered the funds. An official letter has been sent to the General Administration of Jiangsu Bank to be forwarded to the counties for compliance. After receiving the letter, the Administration immediately forwarded it to the county governments mentioned above, ordering the financial bureaus to promptly follow the busy tax grain amounts listed in the articles and the agreed latest dates for depositing the money into the treasury. The received busy tax grains should be delivered to the bank for collection and transferred to the Department of Finance to facilitate payment. After receiving the letter, Chen, the county magistrate of this county, has ordered the Finance Bureau to comply. The clauses of the loan contract for the provincial and regional dikes are excerpted as follows: Two: The total loan amount is 400,000 yuan in national currency. Four: Party B (the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance) publicly appoints Jiangsu Bank as the representative bank to handle the receipt and payment of the loan. Six: This loan shall be designated by Party A (the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance) to use the busy tax silver and grain of Wuxian, Changzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, and Songjiang counties in the 22nd year of the Republic of China as the primary fund for repaying the loan principal and interest. Seven: The Provincial Department of Finance shall order the counties to deliver the funds to Jiangsu Bank by the aforementioned date of deposit, which shall then be transferred to the representative bank to amortize the loan until the principal and interest of the loan are fully paid off.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Rioters Cause Trouble in the First Park: At about 10 p.m. on the second day of the month, as the movie in the First Park was about to end, rioters suddenly provoked trouble, even breaking into the County Chamber of Commerce. The military and police jointly investigated and dealt with the situation. Fearing further changes, the guards fired shots into the sky as a warning, and the rioters fled. At 10:30 p.m., in the direction of the Ya Gong Xie (a type of local government office) on the side of the county government, rioters fired shots again. Fang, the captain of the county police team, immediately assembled his troops and ordered them to fire warning shots into the sky. He also ordered each squad leader to lead their team to search in three directions, but they found nothing. After the police team fired shots, the whole city was confused about the truth and order was greatly disrupted. Fortunately, it was quickly quelled, but everyone was greatly frightened. That night, the county government issued a curfew order and dispatched heavy troops to guard the streets and prisons to prevent unexpected events.</p>
<p>Record of the Court Hearing in the Case of Killing Government Police Officers: In the tragic case of arresting bandits at the Longquan Tea House by the Nan Yun Bridge outside the West Gate of Wuyi, yesterday (the 1st), the Public Security Bureau had already sent five suspects, including the captured bandit Wu Yumei, Zhang Zikun, the suspected criminal Yang Yan, the harboring criminal Tang Tingjin, and the witness Yu Shuangxi, to the county government. At 9 p.m. that night, the newly appointed Secretary Wu Zishi (a local) held a court hearing. The bandit Zhang Zikun had already confessed to shooting and killing the inspector Zhao Wei and three other police officers, and said that the Mauser pistol was obtained from the Japanese during a battle in Dachang. He said, "The police came to search for my gun, so I shot. I didn't want to hurt anyone. The person named Yang has nothing to do with this case," and so on. Wu Yumei confessed that Zhang told her to come to Changzhou to find work and that she didn't know what eating tea was about and that Zhang fired the gun. Yang Yan confessed that she came to Changzhou from Shanghai because of marriage matters and that she had known Zhang for a long time. As a result, the court ordered Zhang Zikun and Wu Yumei to be placed under the custody of the detective team, and Yang Yan, Tang Tingjin, and Wang Shuangxi to be placed under the custody of the police team. Today (the 2nd) at 2 p.m., the original reporters and the owner of the tea house will be summoned for further verification. Jia Fan, the inspector of the Second Sub-station of the Public Security Bureau in charge, has been suspended from his duties by the Director of the Public Security Bureau and replaced by Dong Wanxiong. The Tenth Water Police Team has also submitted a report to the county government, requesting it to be forwarded to the superior authorities, detailing the circumstances of the arrest of the bandits by the First and Third Squads, and the seizure of a Mauser pistol with the serial number 814637, and 51 yuan in cash and foreign currency hidden by the bandits.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Financial Bureau Borrows Funds from the Financial Sector:  Due to the shortfall in tax revenue, the Financial Bureau was unable to pay the provincial taxes that were due. On the first day of the month, it borrowed 20,000 yuan from the financial sector, using the land survey fee as collateral, to be repaid at the end of the year.</p>
<p>County Court Issues Arrest Warrant for Li Yezhong:  The Nantong County Court Prosecutor's Office, based on a report from the County Party Headquarters, accused Li Yezhong, the director of the sports field, of extortion under false pretenses.

<p>Continued Interrogation in the Huai Nong Kidnapping Case: On the 28th of the month, at 1 a.m., two sons of Peng Shixue, the Dean of Studies at the Provincial Agricultural School outside the North Embankment of Huaiyin, were kidnapped by bandits.  After investigation, it was learned that Principal Li Weizhang immediately went to the Huaiyin County Government after the incident, requesting a strict search for the bandits and rescue of the hostages.  County Magistrate He, believing that the school's ten guards were negligent in their defense, first detained two of them and set a deadline for solving the case.  Furthermore, the two Peng Shixue brothers, aged seven and four, respectively, both attended Huaizhong Elementary School in the city.  They were transported back and forth every day by a rickshaw puller.  The emergence of this case suggests that the rickshaw puller is not without suspicion.  Yesterday (the 29th), the rickshaw puller was summoned for interrogation and also taken into custody at the county government for further investigation of the case.</p>
<p>Bandits Burn and Kill in Xiajiaqiao:  At 8 p.m. on the 28th, a group of forty to fifty bandits suddenly arrived at Xiajiaqiao outside the South Gate of Yugou Town in the Fourth District of Huaiyin. Armed with Mauser pistols and rifles, they surrounded the village and began to burn and kill.  For a time, flames soared into the sky and gunfire erupted.  The residents, alarmed, scattered and fled.  It was not until dawn on the 29th that the bandits began to transport clothes and food, heading southwest.  Afterwards, people went to investigate and found that more than twenty houses had been burned down and a farmer named Xia Rushan had been killed. Yesterday, the residents of the village jointly submitted a request to the Fourth District Office, asking them to forward it to the county for review.</p>

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Fengbei Security Corps Destroys Bandit Den and Makes Arrests: In the southern countryside of Jiaxing, the native and migrant populations are mixed, making it easy for bandits to hide. Therefore, robbery cases are frequently heard, and the people cannot sleep peacefully. Now, it is known that Zhong Wen, the head of the Fengbei Security Corps in the Seventh District, reported that some bandits were residing near Xu.... Late at night, he led more than twenty members of the Corps to quietly surround the area near the Yin shop in Beijiang and the Panjiaqiao area, destroying a bandit den and capturing a real bandit in an hour. Three people from Wenzhou, including Hu Renqi, were arrested. The rest escaped with their weapons. Over a hundred items of stolen goods were seized. The bandits and stolen goods were handed over to the Seventh District Office for interrogation. According to their confession, there are still more than ten bandits at large, including Xu... Therefore, the Corps is currently pursuing the remaining bandits.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Case of Husband Murderer Escorted to the Province: Cai Cao, the wife of Cai Shisheng, a resident of Shicun Cao in Xiaoshan County, had an affair with Xu Arong, who was engaged in the oil business locally. Cai was originally a shop assistant in a rice store in Puyuan Town. Last winter, he returned home after the death of his son. Because Xu Arong could not do as he pleased with Cao after her husband returned home, on the night of May 19th, she colluded with her lover and hired a murderer, Cao Chuanlai, to strangle her husband to death. After the county court sentenced Cao and Xu Arong to death on June 24th for premeditated murder, and Cao Chuanlai to fifteen years imprisonment for jointly committing murder, Cao and Xu Arong appealed. Yesterday (the 2nd), the county court specially dispatched police to escort the two criminals along with the complete case files to the province. The Higher Court immediately ordered them to be sent to the detention center to await trial.</p>
<p>Aviation Instructor Commits Robbery:  In recent months, robbery cases have occurred frequently in various parts of West Lake, and the perpetrators are all military-like figures.  They have been successively solved and executed by the Provincial Garrison Headquarters.  On June 28, at 1 p.m., a group of Cantonese pilgrims, Tan Diguang, Weng Fuxiang, and Liu Yuquan, along with a female companion, Ms. Chen, took a sedan chair to West Lake for pilgrimage.  They had just descended from Yanxia Cave and were heading to Longjing when they were suddenly met by an armed military officer, who used a pistol to force them to stop the sedan chair and rob all the banknotes carried by Tan and others.  After the incident, Huang Shaolin, a member of the police station in charge, reported the incident and led police to pursue the suspect.  They apprehended Zheng Zhong, a major instructor at the Aviation School, near Shiwu Cave, and found more than 160 yuan in foreign currency, a Mauser pistol, four rows of bullets, a bayonet, and a map of West Lake.  After being sent to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for strict interrogation, he confessed that he was 27 years old, from Guangdong, and had met a modern girl in Hangzhou.  Because of his excessive spending, he resorted to this tactic.  He also admitted that he was involved in the robbery of more than 700 yuan from the wife of Interior Minister Dong Shaoxiong, who came to Hangzhou to visit the lake on May 23, near the Longjing Mountain.  After being sent to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation, Mao Bangchu, the principal of the Aviation School, learned the news and specially met with Zhu Mingtao, the commander of the Garrison Headquarters, to question him.  Zheng absolutely denied committing any robbery and said that he had been subjected to repeated illegal torture and could not bear it, so he confessed casually, and that he was now injured and vomiting blood.  It is reported that Mao Bangchu believes that if a soldier commits a robbery, he should be severely punished.  However, there are many suspicious points in this case: (1) If Zheng had committed a robbery, he could have used other methods to escape, but instead he rode in a rickshaw nearly three miles away and was arrested without resistance. (2) Zheng had more than 160 yuan in foreign currency in his possession, which was his monthly salary and travel expenses from Nanjing, and was enough to cover his expenses, so why would he commit a robbery? (3) Although Zheng has a fiancée, she is currently in Zhenjiang. It is true that his niece recently came to Hangzhou. Zheng was indeed not away from the Jianqiao campus on the day the Longjing robbery occurred, and I can prove it. Therefore, in order to thoroughly clarify the truth of the case and protect human rights, he has submitted a request to the Ministry of Military Affairs to send personnel to organize a special court to hear the case.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Mistaken Kidnapping of Tea Servant, Police Fight Bandits: Song Yizhang, a wealthy businessman from Dongtaimen in the southern city of Yuyao, was the manager of the Commercial Bank of Hankou. He is now at home. At about 9 o'clock last night, more than ten bandits suddenly came and kidnapped the tea servant Ma Hongmao. They also shot and injured a maid surnamed Yang in the leg and slashed a servant named Su Haihan in the face. When the bandits kidnapped Ma Hongmao, another servant in Song's house, realizing that something was wrong, took the opportunity to report to the Fourth Police Station in the southern city. By the time the police arrived, Ma had already been kidnapped. Soon, the bandits realized that they had kidnapped the wrong person and wanted to come back to kidnap Song. They encountered the police on the way and fought each other. Finally, because the police were outnumbered, all the bandits escaped.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Cargo Ship Sinks, Many Drown: Xiaoshan has had several days of continuous moldy rain in the past few days, and the river water has risen several feet. Every time it reaches the bridge gate, the water flow is rapid, and ships passing through are likely to encounter danger. On the night of the 30th, a melon boat from the northern countryside that came from the Shidong Bridge in the eastern countryside collided with a wooden raft, causing the boat to break and sink, drowning a boatman and two male and female passengers. Also, one afternoon, a cargo ship that came from Shao to Xujia Gate broke through the bridge gate due to the rapid water flow, and the entire ship sank in a short time. The boatman Xu Gui drowned. All the goods, cloth, etc., worth about 700 yuan, were lost in the river and could not be salvaged.</p>
<p>Robbery Occurs at Zheng Jiali: At night, more than ten robbers speaking with a foreign accent broke into the home of Zheng Xihuan, a resident of Zheng Jiali in Sushan, and looted the house. They confined seven men, women, old and young in one room and looted all the soft goods, miscellaneous items, and clothes, worth about a thousand yuan. They also stole more than seventy yuan in silver, five gold rings, and two strings of pearls. About an hour later, they fired two shots into the air and fled. The case has been reported to the county government and a request has been made to issue a general order for the arrest of the perpetrators. It is unknown whether they can be caught.</p>

<p>To the Editor: After reading the letter in your newspaper on June 24th, the official letter from the First District Office of Songjiang County stated that the story about the alleyway lawsuit published in your newspaper on the 21st was not entirely consistent with the facts, in an attempt to deceive the public. This is very surprising. It is understood that this case is a bizarre drama of unreasonable seizure that was first seen in Songjiang. In the 18th year of the Republic, Yao Runmin wanted to build a wall in the alleyway but was prevented by a man named Gu, and he could not get what he wanted. First, he colluded with Wang Zheng to make false accusations, and then Yao Runmin directly made false accusations against Gu. The government officials did not investigate the truth and were deceived by him. Your district chief has already conducted an on-site investigation, so why is he blind and deaf, ignoring public reason? Even if your district chief has a kinship with Yao Runmin, he cannot favor one side and undermine the overall situation. It is not appropriate for those who serve the community. Please pay special attention to the overall situation and do not harm the rights of third parties. We have jointly submitted appeals to various agencies, telling the truth and stating the facts directly. We are sending a special letter to your newspaper to publish a letter to the editor for public judgment. Sincerely, Yang Hehe and others from Zhugan Hui, Songjiang.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Takes Over National Central University</h3>
<p>After the suspension of classes at NCU on the 2nd, the entire campus was filled with a mournful atmosphere and was quite uneasy. The Garrison Headquarters sent many plainclothes detectives to the student dormitories at night, knocking on doors and searching at will. Those who resembled the photographs were immediately arrested. It is said that many people have been arrested before and after, but the names and numbers have not been announced. Therefore, starting on the 1st, those students who lived closer to home and had slightly better financial means have left the school one after another. However, the majority of students still live on campus, awaiting the implementation of compulsory measures. In the afternoon of the 2nd, Xie Shuying, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, and Secretaries Yi Keyi and Zhou, under orders, served as members of the NCU takeover committee. Together with Guo Lianfeng and Zhang Dinghua, who were assisting in the takeover, they arrived at the school in a Ministry of Education car to handle the takeover. First, they separately inventoried the registration, document, and general affairs groups, and then assigned three or two existing staff members to each group to be responsible for safekeeping. Next, they took over the various colleges. Apart from the College of Agriculture, the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Engineering, Law, and Education, as well as the three museums of Science, Library, and Physical Education, were also inspected in detail. An assistant teacher was assigned to each department to be responsible for safekeeping. It is reported that the staff members responsible for safekeeping will be formally appointed by the takeover staff with an official letter to clarify their responsibilities. The takeover staff attached great importance to the issue of campus security and has instructed the captain and deputy captain of the school police team to supervise the police officers to strictly enforce the predetermined measures. If the school police are insufficient, they will request to transfer military police to provide proper protection. The takeover staff also informed each safekeeping staff member that starting on the 3rd, all school offices, classrooms, faculty and staff dormitories, libraries, gymnasiums, science museums, and side gates will be locked and sealed, leaving only the south-facing main gate for access. The gate will be strictly guarded, and anyone without a school badge will not be allowed to enter the school. Starting on the 4th, the school badge will be canceled, and a temporary NCU entry and exit pass will be issued. Anyone without this pass will not be allowed to enter or exit at will. Students and faculty and staff must leave the school by the 3rd (except for safekeeping staff). If they do not obey the order, it is said that it will be enforced. At about 6 p.m., the takeover staff took the transfer inventory and left the school by car, going straight to the Central Hospital to report the takeover situation to Mr. Duan. Although the 3rd is a Sunday, they will still go to the school and handle the takeover of Chen College.</p>
<h3>Results of the Professors' Association Demanding Salary</h3>
<p>At 10 a.m. on the 2nd, ten representatives of the NCU professors, including Zhang Shiyi and Ni Shangda, went to the Ministry of Education to demand their salaries. First, they were met by Xu Bingkun, the Chief Secretary, but the conversation was fruitless. The representatives requested a meeting with Minister Zhu, but were told that Mr. Zhu had already left the Ministry and would not return until 3 p.m. The representatives insisted on meeting the Minister in person and were willing to stay at the Ministry to wait. Mr. Qian then ordered lunch to be prepared and had the representatives dine at the Ministry. They exchanged views with Mr. Qian, and the Ministry of Education decided to pay the full amount of the unpaid salaries for January and 40% of June salaries to NCU faculty and staff before Saturday (the 9th) of next week. The representatives waited until 3:30 p.m., but Minister Zhu had still not returned, so they left the Ministry. It is reported that the professors of the school will hold another meeting at 10 a.m. on the 3rd to discuss effective ways to demand their salaries and how to deal with Guo Xin... and Zhang Xiuzhan's fundraising appeal for the flood disaster.</p>
<h3>Appeal from Graduated Alumni in Beijing</h3>
<p>At 4 p.m. on the 2nd, the General Association of Graduated Alumni of National Southeastern University, National Central University, and National Jinan University convened a meeting of all graduated alumni in Beijing at Zhongnan Middle School to discuss the sudden dissolution of their alma mater. More than sixty people, including Zhang Yaode, attended. They elected Chen Xiexun, Fu Kuanglin, and Ni Shangda as the chair group and resolved the following: (1) to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to immediately withdraw the order to dissolve the alma mater; (2) to designate available funds to be used for the alma mater's expenses; (3) to select a formal president of the alma mater as soon as possible. The criteria for the selection were: (A) a pure scholar who has never participated in practical politics; (B) someone who has served as a university professor or engaged in specialized academic research and has a long-standing reputation; (C) someone who is morally upright and has integrity; (4) to petition the Executive Yuan to immediately order the local... Garrison Headquarters to stop arresting students; (5) to petition... to report the situation of the arrested students and request prosecution in accordance with the law; (6) to investigate the names and numbers of the arrested students; (7) to appoint all executive committees... and the chair group to immediately contact the administrative... of various colleges and universities in Beijing, petitioning the government to withdraw the dissolution order and to postpone the compulsory dissolution. If there are no concrete results, all graduated alumni on the 3rd... determined to save their alma mater with the spirit of peaceful struggle.</p>
<h3>Professors' Association Submits Document to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Submitting [this document] regarding the fact that Zhu Jiahua, former president of the aforementioned school and current Minister of Education, has embezzled flood relief funds from the faculty and staff of the aforementioned school, and has issued a statement regarding the injury of Vice Minister Duan Xipeng by a small number of students from the aforementioned school, implying that the association's colleagues were the instigators. [We] request that the Executive Yuan promptly dispatch impartial officials to investigate the truth. We, the faculty and staff of the aforementioned school, were required to deduct flood relief funds when receiving our salaries for September and October of last year, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan, in accordance with the National Government's general order. Zhu Jiahua, the former president of the aforementioned school and current Minister of Education, took advantage of the difficulty in Shanghai this year to transfer these funds and issue full salaries for the months from November of last year to January of this year to himself, Liu Guanghua, former dean of the Law School of the aforementioned school, Guo Xinsong, former secretary-general of the aforementioned school and current director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, and Zhang Xiunan, former head of the accounting section of the aforementioned school and current director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education. At that time, our salaries were only paid up to October of last year, while the salaries of Zhu, et al., had already been paid up to January of this year, yet we have not heard of the relief funds deducted from our salaries for September and October being remitted to the National Government's relief organization. It is self-evident that Zhu Jiahua embezzled the full three months' salary issued to himself, et al. We collectively took leave on June 6 of this year to protest. Five eighty professors including Professor Ding Sixian issued a statement based on the 16th meeting of the association, announcing the truth and requesting Zhu Jiahua to remit the misappropriated disaster relief funds of our school within three days to the relief organization. Now that the National Government's Relief Committee has announced its end, we have still not received the receipt from the said committee. Zhu Jiahua used our small contributions to enrich himself. On the day that the Executive Yuan is promoting the punishment of corruption and the purification of officialdom, this official can turn a blind eye to this. In addition to Ding Sixian et al. presenting a request to the President of the Control Yuan to impeach in accordance with the law, we should ask the Executive Yuan to send an impartial official to seriously investigate the truth. That's one thing. The aforementioned school's injury of Vice Minister Duan Xipeng by a small number of students, according to Vice Minister Duan's original report to the Executive Yuan that day, the Executive Yuan's circular order on June 29, and the news reports from various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, is recognized as the sole action of a very small number of students and has nothing to do with our organization. However, Zhu Jiahua hates that our organization has exposed the corruption of relief funds during his tenure as the president of the aforementioned school and issued a statement in the newspapers, implying that our organization's colleagues were the instigators. The colleagues of our association are ashamed that their scholarship is not profound, but they dare not consider themselves evil. Before Zhu Jiahua can definitively name the members of our association, we do not wish to argue with him. However, for the sake of national education and the credibility of the party-state, we should ask the Executive Yuan to promptly dispatch impartial officials to seriously investigate the truth. That's the second thing. The Executive Yuan has issued an order to dissolve National Central University this time. For the sake of the overreach of several dozen students, it is willing to sacrifice the studies of thousands of students, yet it has not been mentioned that the formal president of the school has been vacant for half a year, and the faculty and students of the school have appealed for the determination of funding. The colleagues of our association mostly consider this to be excessive. Just because we have been waiting to be punished, we will not look at ourselves, let alone care for others. The Executive Yuan has decided to dissolve the school, and we have nothing to worry about. We will not be reluctant about the positions of the school's faculty and staff, and we resolved to prepare to leave the school at the 18th meeting of the Professors' Association on the first day of this month. Before leaving the school, the Relief Committee must issue formal receipts for the flood relief funds, and the government is responsible for fulfilling the employment contracts issued by former President Zhu and issuing all salaries to show the determination of the Executive Yuan's dissolution and to fulfill the government's due responsibility. Representatives including Zhang Shiyi have separately submitted a request, and we are also asking the Executive Yuan to send an impartial official to thoroughly investigate the truth about Zhu Jiahua's embezzlement of disaster relief funds and insult to the personality of our faculty and staff. If Zhu Jiahua is indeed guilty of embezzlement and slander, the Executive Yuan will have an appropriate disposal for the sake of the nation's laws, to punish corruption, to clarify responsibilities, and for the future of education. If the members of our association have falsely accused and committed evil deeds, we also ask the government to punish them with the punishment they deserve. Pressing words, [we] cannot overcome the extreme of awaiting orders. [This is] respectfully submitted to Wang, the President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, by the Professors' Association of National Central University. July 2nd, the 21st year of the Republic of China. Three items are attached: (1) A statement on the matter of the former principal Zhu transferring the flood relief funds of our school; (2) Zhu Jiahua's speech published in the Central Daily on June 30; (3) The minutes of the 18th meeting of our association on July 1.</p>
<p>Telegrams of Condolence Received from Various Parties. Jiang Zhongzheng telegraphed: "I was shocked to hear about the incident at Central University. I am concerned about your injuries. Please take care and recover soon." Wu Zhongxin Guangxian, Governor of Anhui Province... Guo Taiqi, the Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Gao Xibing of Tianjin, and others sent condolences to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Alumni Protect the School</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the General Association of National Southeast University, National Central University, and National Jinan University Graduated Alumni believes that the Executive Yuan's dissolution of the alma mater, the suspension of all professors, the order for all students to leave the school, and the indiscriminate arrest of innocent students were inappropriate measures. A joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees was held at Gongdelin at noon yesterday to discuss three important cases: 1. Issuing a declaration of the movement to protect the school; 2. Condoling the professors and students at the school; 3. Petitioning the Executive Yuan to withdraw the dissolution order of National Central University and release the arrested innocent students. The meeting did not end until after 2 p.m.</p>

<h3>Guo Brothers Win Decisive Right in Public Doubles Tennis Semifinals</h3>
<p>|7-5, 9-6, 6-4|</p>
<p>Zheng Yu vs. Tu Ling Semifinal Today The semifinals of the Chinese Tennis Association's public doubles tennis tournament were held yesterday at the Chinese Tennis Court. However, the match between Tu Kaiyuan and Ling Xianyang against Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang was postponed to today because Tu was in Nanjing and could not return to Shanghai in time. Guo Pengnian and Guo Qida defeated Ma Anquan and Tang Yongchun by a score of 7-5, 9-7, 6-4, earning the right to the finals. The strengths of both sides were quite even, but there were few exciting moments. In the first set, Tang and Ma had a 4-1 lead, with the momentum to finish in one go, but they lost four consecutive games and were defeated. The second set was similar. Each had made contributions. In the third set, the Guo brothers took an early 5-1 lead, but Tang took three games to make it 4-5. In the end, due to a failure in the tenth game, all previous efforts were lost.</p>
<p>Today at 4:30 PM, Tu Kaiyuan and Ling Xianyang will face Zheng Zhao and Yu Tianguang at the Chinese Tennis Court to determine the right to the finals.</p>
<h3>Temple Bell Records (42)</h3>
<p>— Unswept Court Zhai Fu</p>
<p>Forty-six nights of peace and quiet. Mr. Zhu told me, "Yesterday was the start of school. What's surprising is that everyone was willing to come to class without picking an auspicious day. You see, military life is such an important form of education. It can cultivate a spirit of fearlessness to break unreasonable timidity. It can cultivate the habit of communal living to break the farmers' disunited, anarchic temperament. The people can only live a reasonable life and run a reasonable education under the protection of their own military force. What do you think?" "I said, 'I completely agree with Mr. Zhu's views. But training just these twenty or so people with guns is not very effective. We need to find a way to make this kind of training universal throughout the village.'" Mr. Zhu said, "Right! The greatest goal of popularizing military education is for the entire village to be soldiers, the entire township to be soldiers, the entire county to be soldiers, the entire province to be soldiers, the entire country to be soldiers, but with no one relying on being a soldier to make a living. We are talking about the village in the village. Today, we must convene a village meeting to discuss the plan for the entire village to be soldiers." Mr. Jiang said, "Now there are more people than guns, so we can stipulate the time and train in shifts. Each shift trains for one hour a day. I can train six shifts of people with more than twenty guns. Six people share one gun. If something happens, if one is injured, another will take his place. If five people are injured, the gun is still in the hands of the sixth person. We must go out and fight with the spirit of holding the gun even if it means death. It must be as impregnable as an iron city." I said, "It is without a doubt that all able-bodied men must receive shooting training. But in the event of a battle, it seems a bit uneconomical in terms of manpower to have six people protect one gun. I suggest adding a broadsword team to assist in the battle." Battalion Commander Jiang said, "If a broadsword cuts someone, the bloodstains will congeal when the wind blows, making it difficult to use. It is not as good as a stabbing sword. I agree to add a sword team. Spears are also very useful. Why not add a spear team? That way, everyone will have combat power. The momentum will be so great that we can retreat the enemy without a fight." I said, "I know a few boxing techniques. Once, I was joking with Wang Laoer, and I disarmed him with three punches and two kicks. People who know how to box can use other people's guns to hit people, while people who don't know how to box are just handing over their guns to be hit. In my opinion, we must all learn how to box." Battalion Commander Jiang very much agreed. Mr. Zhu asked if there were any good boxing instructors in the village. I said, "If you want to learn the skill of disarming, you must hire a boxing instructor who knows how to fight sanshou boxing. My master Zhang Feihu's life's work is all in sanshou. He knows more than a hundred sets of sanshou. If we spend one or two years learning thirty or forty sets, we will gain some basic skills. If we continue to learn, we will definitely be able to generate great power. He also knows swordsmanship. Spears go without saying. Master Zhang lives over there in Wansongling. If he is willing to come, he will definitely be able to help Battalion Commander Jiang create an invincible militia."</p>
<h3>Wimbledon Tennis Tournament Concludes</h3>
<p>|All Titles Resolved|</p>
<p>The long-awaited Wimbledon World Tennis Tournament in England has concluded, and all titles have been awarded. The interest in this competition and the many changes in the course of the battles were quite thought provoking. The titles for each event are briefly described below.</p>
<h3>Men's Singles Final</h3>
<p>Vines defeats Austin |6-4, 6-2, 6-0| The men's singles competition was the most exciting. The French general, Henri Cochet, who held the highest power in the world, was defeated by the British Collins in the preliminary round, and Borotra was eliminated by the Spaniard Manuel in the third week of the tournament. Both of these upsets were unexpected. The semifinals of the final eight were even more surprising. The British Panley, who was expected by many, was defeated by Crawford, and the United States lost two major generals: Shields to Austin and Wood to Sato. But Crawford was unable to defeat the young American Vines, and Sato was ultimately defeated by Austin. Austin was the mainstay of Britain, and Vines was the American champion last year. Before the two faced each other, it was thought that Austin had a good chance of defeating Vines, but the result of the final was that Vines defeated Austin 6-4, 6-2, 6-0 to win the championship. Austin's crushing defeat was shocking, and Vines' prestige was enough to make people all over the world admire him. He is truly worthy of being the second Tilden.</p>
<h3>Men's Doubles Final French Players Defeat British Team</h3>
<p>|6-0, 4-6, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5| Because the undefeated American general Allison and Van Ryn participated in the men's doubles, it was thought that the championship would belong to them. Unexpectedly, they were defeated by the French Borotra and Brugnon in the semifinals by a score of 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 in straight sets. The finalists were the aforementioned French team and the British Panley and Hughes. The two teams were of equal strength and the situation was even. The British team took the lead in the first three sets with a score of 0-6, 6-4, 6-3. Unexpectedly, in the last two sets, they lost to the French team with a score of 5-7, 5-7. The championship was then awarded to Borotra and Brugnon.</p>
<h3>Mixed Doubles Final</h3>
<p>Manuel Leighton Defeat Hoper-Sigi The most eye-catching players in mixed doubles were Mady and Vines from the United States. Unexpectedly, the United States gave up their right to play, which was disappointing. The defeat of the French Brugnon and Madam Mathieu to the Australian Hoper and the Belgian Sigi, and the defeat of Cochet and Lady Hiddings Island to the Spaniard Manuel and the American Leighton, were all noteworthy matches. In the final, the Spaniard Manuel and the American Leighton defeated the Australian Hoper and the Belgian Sigi by a score of 7-5 and 6-2 to win the championship.</p>
<h3>Women's Singles Final</h3>
<p>Madam Mady Defeats Miss Jack Jacobs |6-3 and 6-1 It can be said that the American Helen Wills Mady winning the women's singles championship was as stable as Mount Tai, without any doubt. In the final, she defeated the American Helen Jack Jacobs by a score of 6-3 and 6-1. Madam Mathieu, who was once carefully taught by Miss Lanlin, who had previously won the world women's championship for seven consecutive years, was defeated by Miss Jack Jacobs by a score of 7-5 and 6-1, which greatly disappointed the French tennis community.</p>
<h3>Women's Doubles Final</h3>
<p>Belgian-French Team Defeats American Team</p>
<p>|6-4 and 6-3 In the women's doubles final, the French Miss Metaxa and the Belgian Miss Sigi defeated the American team of Miss Leighton and Helen Jack Jacobs, with a score of 6-4 and 6-3. The championship was awarded to the Belgian-French team.</p>
<h3>Cochet Loses Title</h3>
<p>In the Losers' Championship final, Cochet defeated the Japanese Kuwabara 6-2, 6-4 to win the championship.</p>

<h3>Uneventful Gold Market Last Week in Finance</h3>
<p>Due to the end of the banks' semi-annual period, the gold market situation last week did not undergo major changes. Because it was the end of the semi-annual period for each bank this year, the market only operated for four days, but the situation was complicated, fluctuating around 750 taels. The industry generally did not have much trading. However, people were uneasy. There was no special news from abroad, but the Lausanne Conference was still in turmoil. Since the opening of the market in August at the beginning of the week, it rose slightly by 0.002 taels, to 751.3 taels. There were fluctuations of 10 taels that day. The highest price was 757.1 taels, and the lowest was 747 taels. This was caused by large investors (Yufeng Yong sold through other companies) selling short and Guangbang being strongly inclined to sell. The subsequent trend was upward, but it was chaotic. As for the large silver bars, they were unpredictable, fluctuating up and down. The US silver bars initially had no glory or disgrace, but then fell. The Shanghai foreign exchange market prices did not change. The domestic market, like Xianling, slightly decreased by 0.0625, the US dollar decreased by 0.1875 in the near term, and only decreased by 0.0625 in the long term, because the swap seems to be approaching. The industry generally sells near and buys far, hedging. The price of the US dollar in the near term was over 40 taels, and 37-38 taels in the long term, which is roughly 70 taels before and after the settlement price. The exchange rate continued to fall (it has fallen for four weeks), with the British and American exchange rates each decreasing by a small 0.03875. Afterwards, due to the closing of the customs, both the long and short sides adopted a cautious approach and did not dare to overdo it. By the close of trading on Thursday, it was 753.4 taels. The total increase was 2.3 taels compared to the previous Saturday (it has risen for four consecutive weeks, totaling about 32-33 taels). The difference for the entire week was only 10.01 taels. However, because the price was not suitable, no spot goods were opened. The cost of storage was increased by 10 taels. There were still more than 8,500 bars that had not been swapped in July, which will likely be cashed out. The amount of bars in August is approximately 20,000. There may be changes after the market opens next week. Today (the 3rd), the large silver bars are reporting a decrease of 0.0625 again. The detailed situation of the four days is recorded below.</p>
<p>(Monday) The large silver bars and US silver bars did not increase or decrease, but the exchange rate increased, indicating that the British and American exchange rates were stable. The initial opening price of the gold market increased slightly by 0.002 taels, to 751.3 taels. Afterwards, the price fluctuated, but buying was encouraged, reaching 757.1 taels. Suddenly, large investors, such as Yifeng Yong and Hengyu, heavily sold short (it is said that they were selling US dollars for Yufeng Yong). Hengxing from Guangbang also sold. In an instant, it plummeted by 9 taels, only reaching 748 taels. At noon, it was 751 taels, and it closed at 749 taels. In the afternoon, the market opened at 748.5 taels, then fell from 749.8 taels to 747 taels. Because Dalianbang and Zhifeng Yong and Fuyu were selling, Yifeng and others started buying, reaching 751.7 taels.

<h3>Sunday's Daily Interest Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver and foreign exchange market was still sluggish due to Sunday. The daily interest rate was slightly higher. The early market was 6 cents 8.925 li, and the noon market was 6 cents 8.9375 li, resulting in an increase of 0.00075 li compared to the previous day's noon market, but the situation was generally not very good. It is feared that today's opening of the banks will inevitably have another twist. The early market for foreign exchange drafts was 275,000, and there was no market for banknotes. The noon market for foreign exchange drafts was 210,000, and there was still no trading in banknotes. The early market for silver loans was 5%, which was an improvement of 0.03% compared to the previous day. The price in the noon market was the same. The trading of loan tickets was over 4 million. The banks did not receive or release money due to the closing of the customs. The money houses and silver companies only released over 24 million, and the foreign companies only released over 5.1 million. The amount of remittances from various routes was 200,000 to 300,000.

<h3>Interest Rate Discussion Opens</h3>
<p>The silver market in June was known to be loose, with the daily interest rate being only a few cents. As a result, the total amount calculated for the entire month was only 1.297 taels, with an average of only 0.06 taels per day. Therefore, the Money Industry Association's standing committee decided that the interest rate for deposits would be set at 2.95%, which is equal to the lowest price. The interest rate on loans will be set at a fixed rate of 4.5%, and then gradually increased. Even so, the highest interest rate for loans will not exceed 10.05%.</p>
<h3>Banks Open Today</h3>
<p>The banking industry has been in its semi-annual closing period since July 1st, with two days of holidays. Yesterday was also Sunday, so there were three days of closure. Now that these three days of holidays have passed, it has been decided that businesses will open as usual starting today (July 4th), and all kinds of collections and releases will be processed.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Sharply in the Second Half of the Week</h3>
<p>Each gang handled 19,960 bales of current and future yarn. The cotton yarn market situation was very weak at the beginning of the week because the domestic economic situation was in decline, the countryside was impoverished, and real demand was becoming increasingly sluggish. Therefore, there was talk of an increase in the bottom goods of local yarn, and new low prices were found in the marked yarn market. The current month saw 138.5 taels. Because some manufacturers were buying, the American cotton market soon recovered due to insect pests. At the same time, raw cotton prices soared, and a sudden rebound occurred, causing the sluggish market to suddenly turn for the better. On Friday, the price soared by 3.78 taels. The Nambu area saw good conditions and purchased in large quantities, buying a lot. Therefore, the situation became increasingly tight. The price rose again at the end of the week, and everyone was consistently bullish. However, the large short positions remained quiet. The buying momentum was strong again, making it difficult to decline temporarily. What the future holds will still depend on the real demand. According to statistics, each gang bought a total of 19,960 bales of current and future goods for the entire week, including 557 bales from fellow traders. The spot price increased by 1 tael. The price of marked yarn in each month increased by 0.037-1.5 taels compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 195,100 bales. The amount of bales purchased by each gang is listed below: Gang, Number of Bales: Guangdong, 7,670; Yunnan, 3,300; Ningbo, 290; Sichuan, 940; Jiangxi, 30; Shantou, 1,475; Wuhu, 25; Fujian, 30; Changsha, 30; Inland, 345; Xiamen, 35; Guangzhou, 21; Nanyang, 10; Fellow Traders, 557.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Active Buying in Zheng Biao</h3>
<p>Raw cotton consumption remained sluggish as before. The cotton market was relatively calm at the beginning of last week. However, by Friday, with US cotton rising for two consecutive days, a total of 40 points, coupled with serious news of US cotton pests, buyers became very active, and retail investors rushed to cover their short positions, leading to a drastic change in the situation. The bullish trend was intense, with prices soaring by 1.7 or 1.8 taels in a single day. Over the weekend, new bullish forces swarmed in, citing adverse weather conditions in the US cotton region, which fueled the buying frenzy and strengthened the market. Although a major player engaged in profit-taking at the close, it was still difficult to contain the new buying wave. This situation was entirely due to excessive short positions held by retail investors, who, upon seeing an improvement in the environment, rushed to cover their positions without delay, displaying ample courage that was temporarily beyond human control. As for the sales of existing cotton at various factories, there was still no significant development, indicating that the factories still had sufficient cotton in stock. However, US cotton inventories were gradually increasing. The price of Zheng Biao cotton for each month rose by 2.6 or 2.7 taels compared to last week. This bullish trend was somewhat excessive. The total transaction volume for the week was statistically 37,250 dan, with 2,500 bales of Yao Hua cotton as the source. US cotton rose by 65 points compared to last week. The prices of spot cotton purchased by various factories are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Name   Highest Price  Lowest Price  Transaction Volume  Delivery Term</p>
<p>Shandong Fine Velvet Cotton 30.50   :::   1,000 pieces  Spot, delivered at the warehouse</p>
<p>Shaanxi West Cotton  39.00   27.50   2,100 pieces  Spot, delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Yao Cotton   24.80   23.60   17,000 bales  Spot, delivered to the factory</p>
<p>The following is a breakdown of the high and low prices of Zheng Biao during the week:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Weekend Price  Compared to the Previous Week</p>

<h3>US Cotton Rises in Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market conditions were mixed. It was firm due to poor weather and short covering, with futures rising by 14 to 18 points and spot prices rising by 20 points. English cotton futures rose by 2 to 4 points and spot prices rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is on the left.

<h3>The Grain and Rice Market Situation Turns Weak</h3>
<p>Shanghai South: The rice market had a slight increase in supply yesterday, approximately reaching a dozen dealers. Moreover, the remaining stock in the Pudong area was scattered. The demand from stores in urban and rural areas became sluggish again. Due to the stable market outlook in Zhabei, people's confidence weakened. The price of rice from the Suzhou-Tongzhou region decreased by two chi. The sales of early and late rice became even more sluggish, and the market price continued to decline due to abundant supply. The transaction of silver dollar rice was sluggish for several consecutive days, and subsequent arrivals were scarce. The sales of foreign sharp rice were slow, and the market was slightly firm.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: The supply of West Road remained thin. In addition, there was still a significant accumulation of river sediment. Trading on this street was due to the weather turning sunny, with stores adding to their inventory, with Northern Japonica being the most abundant. The market price was firm, slightly weaker by one or two chi. The supply of Shipu Qing Si thin rice and Jiashan rice was small, and trading was extremely sluggish, with a downward trend. Although there was not much silver dollar rice, the top quality rice moved slightly, and the market was mediocre.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Silk Market Remains Pessimistic Last Week</h3>
<p>New York's Dumping of Japanese Silk Continues Unabated. The Price in Lyon Remains Weak.</p>
<p>Although Inland Silk Sales are Not Lifeless, Factories are Selling at a Loss.</p>
<p>Last week, the silk market in foreign firms in Shanghai still lacked the possibility of progress. It was found that silk merchants in the New York market had purchased the remaining stock of 100,000 bales of Japanese silk at a low price. Furthermore, Japanese merchants were recklessly dumping new term silk at a depreciated price, causing the sales of Chinese silk in the United States to be almost completely encroached upon. Although Lyon had demand from factories, etc., the price still tended to fall. Chinese merchants reluctantly sold off, but it was still difficult to turn the transaction around. There were only a few transactions in London, and the price remained weak. Although the intake of silk from inland silk mills was not lifeless, the price was mediocre, and the factories were only selling at a loss, trying to maintain the status quo. Therefore, among the 113 silk factories in the city, only 32 were barely operating. Moreover, most of the silk was entrusted to the factories to reel aged cocoons on behalf of customers, providing only one or two months of work. Unexpectedly, labor-management disputes occurred again in silk factories in the Hongkou district, leading to strikes, which affected more than 20 silk factories in both the Hongkou and Zhabei districts, all of which were shut down. Currently, it is estimated that only the silk factories in the concession area and the Nanshi district, a total of only seven or eight factories, are working. Overseas silk sales remain sluggish, and the domestic financial community still has no intention of providing loans to silk merchants. Furthermore, silk factory workers are still uncooperative and have started another labor strike. The future of the silk market is increasingly pessimistic. The following is a list of Chinese silk market prices in the European and American markets last week. (Unit of Price in New York: Gold Dollar per Pound; Unit of Price in Lyon: Franc per Kilogram)</p>
<p>Silk  Type  New York  Lyon Silk  Type  New York  Lyon</p>
<p>High-Grade Shanghai Warp 1.38  98  High-Grade Dried Warp 1.18  71</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Warp 1.26  84  Medium-Grade Dried Warp 1.04  59</p>
<p>Medium-Grade Shanghai Warp 1.14  70  Low-Grade Dried Warp 0.90  45</p>
<p>Low-Grade Shanghai Warp 1.01  56  High-Grade Large Warp 1.08  68</p>
<p>High-Grade Shandong Warp 1.18  81  Low-Grade Large Warp 0.82  42</p>
<p>High-Grade Sichuan Warp 1.12  76  High-Grade White Silk 0.61  30</p>
<p>High-Grade Gray Warp 0.56  32</p>
<h3>Coal: Jiawang Coal Sales are Sluggish with a Declining Outlook</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of Japanese coal, sales of Jiawang bituminous coal lumps and fines were stagnant. Very few factories and workshops in Shanghai and other places were buying, resulting in a gradual decline in selling prices. Yesterday, the market called out quotes, and the price per ton secretly fell by another five qian. The current selling price of screened lump coal is nine taels per ton, and coal fines are eight taels. It is predicted that prices will continue to decline in the near future.</p>

<h3>President Wang and Others Return to Nanjing After Completing Their Public Duties</h3>
<p>Discussing Financial Issues with Song Ziwen</p>
<p>Visiting Chen Mingshu and Urging Him to Postpone Going Abroad</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions from All Sectors on Finance and Diplomacy</p>
<p>He Yingqin and Li Jishen Remain in Shanghai and Have Not Left</p>
<p>Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, accompanied by He Yingqin, Li Jishen, Gu Zhutong, and others, came to Shanghai to discuss financial and bandit suppression military expenditure issues with Finance Minister Song Ziwen, as detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan and Guo Taiqi visited Song Ziwen to thoroughly discuss the Northeast Customs issue. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, Wang Jingwei, He Yingqin, and Song Ziwen held final discussions on the allocation of funds for bandit suppression military expenditure. Wang also invited leaders from all sectors in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to solicit their opinions on various financial and diplomatic matters. Wang's mission in Shanghai has been completed, and he returned to Nanjing by special train last night. Details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Northeast Customs Tariff Issue: Yesterday morning at 9:15 AM, Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan and Minister to Great Britain Guo Taiqi went to Qiqi Road to visit Finance Minister Song Ziwen to discuss the incident of the puppet state instigated by the Japanese to seize Northeast Customs. Song first reported the detailed process, and then they mutually studied countermeasures. At 10:45 AM, upon receiving a telegram from Wang Jingwei inviting Luo and Guo to his residence for talks, they stopped their discussion. Luo and Guo immediately went to meet Wang and reported the progress of their discussion with Song and the diplomatic countermeasures. After ten minutes, Luo left first, and Guo continued to discuss everything with Wang until around 12:00 PM. Guo accompanied Wang and his wife to Guo's residence on Laoli Yu Road for about ten minutes before Wang returned to his residence.</p>
<p>Luo Wen'gan's Remarks: When Luo Wen'gan returned to his residence from Wang's residence yesterday morning, reporters immediately visited him. According to him, after meeting with Minister Song today, he knew more details about the incident of the puppet state seizing Northeast Customs. Subsequently, in response to President Wang's invitation, he went to Wang's residence to report. The result of the meeting was that they would still follow the established policy, protesting seriously to Japan on one hand and urging relevant countries to pay attention on the other. Recently, the Japanese have been wantonly spreading rumors about the Northeast issue, claiming that the central government has reached an understanding on Northeast Customs tariffs, and even that the central government has proposed a survey team to turn the Northeast into an autonomous state. Such rumors are truly laughable. The Northeast has already fallen completely, and tax collection agencies such as customs have also been seized. This is an entire problem. How can the central authorities resolve the customs incident alone? As for the claim that the Northeast will be turned into an autonomous state, it is even more absurd. The Northeast is a province of our country, how can the central government abandon it on its own? The purpose of such rumors is to incite the public's dissatisfaction with the government. I have been in politics for many years, and I dare to guarantee with my personal integrity that the above rumors are completely untrue. Our people must trust the government, be of one heart and one mind, and face the national crisis together. We should not be surprised by Japan's malicious propaganda, and its tricks will defeat themselves. I always rely on a down-to-earth approach in my work, and I do not like to flaunt. As long as I am in politics for one day, I will resolutely shoulder one day's responsibility. Today's diplomacy has reached a critical juncture. On the one hand, we must rely on the assistance of world justice, and on the other hand, we must unanimously prepare and make a great determination. We cannot be timid simply because we are inferior to others, and then we can succeed.</p>
<p>Wang Visits Chen Mingshu: Wang Jingwei drove to visit Chen Mingshu at 9:00 AM yesterday, strongly urging Chen to rest in Shanghai for a while, postpone his trip abroad, and return to Nanjing to resume his duties as soon as his vacation is over, to face the national crisis. After about half an hour of conversation, Chen indicated that he could postpone his trip abroad, but he still firmly declined the position of Minister of Communications.</p>
<p>Wang Invites People from All Sectors for Talks: Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei invited leaders from all sectors in Shanghai to a meeting at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon to solicit their opinions on financial and diplomatic issues. The first group included Xu Xinliu, Li Fusun, Shi Liangcai, and Huang Yanpei from the financial community. Wang not only detailed the government's diplomatic policy and various new plans, but also strongly requested their help in raising funds for bandit suppression. The meeting lasted until 4:50 PM. The second group included Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Zhang Zhuping, Pan Gongbi, Wang Boqi, Yan Duhe, and Pan Gongzhan from the press. The meeting lasted until 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Final Consultation between Wang and Song: The issue of bandit suppression military expenditure and financial consolidation had been discussed once the day before. Yesterday morning, Jiangsu Province Chairman Gu Zhutong once again consulted with Song on everything. At 4:05 PM in the afternoon, Gu again visited President Wang to discuss in detail. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, in order to urgently return to his defense post, needed a definitive method for bandit suppression military expenditure, so he went to Song's residence again at 4:30 PM to renegotiate with Song. At 5:40 PM, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei also attended by invitation. The three of them had an open discussion on everything until 6:05 PM when they completed. It is said that the result of yesterday afternoon's discussion was that a definitive method had been decided for the bandit suppression military expenditure, and the Ministry of Finance would allocate funds as soon as possible so that the bandit suppression work could be completed on schedule.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Banquet: At 8:00 PM last night, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet for Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan, He Yingqin, Li Jishen, and Zhang Shizhao at his residence in Wanglu on Haige Road. Wang Jingwei was also invited, but he declined temporarily because he had other important business. During the banquet, Mayor Wu gave a presentation on the latest developments in Shanghai. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until around 10:00 PM when they dispersed.</p>
<p>Wang and Others Returned to Nanjing Last Night: Wang's mission in Shanghai was completed, and he returned to Nanjing by special train from the North Station at 10:00 PM last night, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways. As for Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan, he returned to Nanjing by night train at 11:00 PM last night. Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu returned to Nanjing by through train at 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon. He Yingqin and Li Jishen remained in Shanghai to discuss bandit suppression military expenditure with Finance Minister Song Ziwen.</p>

After arriving in England, I will schedule an audience with the British Emperor to present my credentials. As for attending the League of Nations meeting, I have not yet received orders from the government.</p>
<h3>Labor and Management of Silk Factories Negotiate Fruitlessly Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Trade Association Decides on a General Meeting</p>
<p>Part of Zhabei Resumes Work First</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute in the Hongkou district silk factories has been directly negotiated by representatives of both sides at the Silk Factory Trade Association. Because there was no result, yesterday (3rd) at 3:00 PM, negotiations continued at the same location. As a result, although the labor and management sides were gradually approaching, it still depended on the decision of the general meeting of the trade association and was still difficult to resolve. However, the labor side's attitude has eased, and most of the silk factories in Zhabei have resumed work. This morning, the silk reeling female workers in the Hongkou district went to various factories to inquire about the opening date. The various news obtained yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>Most Silk Factories in Zhabei Resume Work: This labor strike was originally caused by workers from the Yichang and other three silk factories in the Hongkou district, and then spread to the eight silk factories in the Jin district and the silk factories in the Zhabei district, which automatically stopped work. From yesterday morning, the fifteen silk factories in the Zhabei district that automatically stopped work resumed work as usual according to the requirements of the employees. The silk factories that pulled back and resumed work at 6:00 AM accounted for 60-70% of the total. Female workers and others went to work one after another, and there were no accidents throughout the day. However, it was heard that a certain silk factory in Yidao Jiaojiao Fangtong had outside workers who caused a slight dispute in the afternoon, which was quickly quelled by the police stationed at the factory.</p>
<p>The Hongkou Silk Factory Has Not Yet Been Resolved: Representatives of both labor and management sides held a second negotiation meeting at the original location yesterday afternoon. The representatives from both sides were not much changed from the previous day. The management side was still Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Peishen, and Huang Yongfan (Shen Chen was absent due to business), and the labor side was still Yuan Yunlong, Yan Aizhu, and other dozens of people. First, Zhu, Zhang, and Huang, representatives of the trade association, stated that this labor strike must not be treated the same as the labor strikes of the previous two years. In the past, the ordinary silk price was between 1,200 and 1,300 taels, and the factory could still make some profit and might as well compromise slightly. Now, the ordinary silk price is only 400 to 500 taels. According to the cost of old cocoons and silk, it still needs to lose 600 to 700 taels. The capital has been completely lost, and the remaining cocoons have been mortgaged to the financial community, and all are heavily in debt. Most of the factories currently in operation are reeling on behalf of customers. The price of each car is one part, calculated at the highest silver price of one tael and two and a half qian (silkworm moths belong to the owner of the goods), and the lowest price is one tael and five fen (silkworm moths belong to the factory). Even the current wage of 4 jiao and 2 fen per worker is difficult to maintain. It is nothing more than the cost of living for both labor and management. Now, the workers insist on increasing wages, then the factory will inevitably raise the price, and many inland silk factories have closed down, and the price is cheaper than in Shanghai. The owner of the goods will inevitably take the cocoons and hand them over to inland silk factories for reeling. If so, both labor and management will have no benefit but harm. If the price is not raised and the exhausted factory is forced to increase the burden, it is really impossible. I hope that the workers will understand the difficulties of the factory. At present, do not hold prejudices and discuss solutions together so that the factories can resume work as soon as possible to avoid going to extremes, which would be very fortunate. However, at the first meeting and at the talks at the Social Affairs Bureau, the labor side only mentioned three points: wages, time, and work. Chairman Shen of the Trade Association accepted the time and work points at that time and promised to persuade the factory to improve. However, the wage point was not resolved. Now, suddenly eight points are raised, five points are suddenly increased, which is not what was expected and is even more difficult to resolve. I hope to reduce the requirements and discuss the progress together. So, to this, the representatives of the labor side discussed with each other and agreed to reduce the wage by one point, and the minimum increase per worker was to five jiao, the promotion of workers was reduced from four workers to two workers, and the weekly rest days remained the same. The Trade Association representative Mr. Zhu and others believed that this still had to be decided by the public opinion of the trade association because the last general meeting decided that the burden could not be increased at all. As a result, the decision will be made after convening a general meeting of the trade association to solicit public opinion, or will be submitted to the Party and government authorities for mediation. The meeting was adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Municipal Party Headquarters Mediated the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Without Results. After the outbreak of the labor dispute in the local Chinese medicine industry, the Municipal Party Headquarters advised a return to work and sent personnel to mediate. Labor and management negotiated last night. The trade association will hold a general membership meeting tomorrow. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Mediation. To prevent the expansion of the pharmaceutical industry labor dispute, the Municipal Party Headquarters invited representatives of the labor union the night before last and advised the employees of Feng Cunren to return to work. Yesterday, Zhu Yangwu of the Civil Training Section was dispatched to mediate. The labor union made demands based on the preconditions put forward by the group meetings. Zhang Meian of the trade association responded to the so-called preconditions of the labor union: (1) The store had no surplus last year, and the account books are available for inspection. It is difficult to accept the request of the employees to borrow fifty yuan in advance. (2) The issue of substitute workers is an overall problem for the entire industry and should be resolved at the association's general membership meeting tomorrow. The store is not in a position to make a separate claim, resulting in no results.</p>
<p>Labor-Management Negotiations. Yesterday at 5 p.m., the pharmaceutical industry labor union sent five representatives, Zhao Zhenhui, Fang Qingjian, Chen Hezhi, Yuan Pinzhang, and Feng Xingkang, along with three employee representatives from Feng Cunren, Ye Yazhang, Guo Yuankang, and Yuan Qingshun, to the Chinese Medicine Trade Association to begin negotiations on the Feng Cunren strike dispute. Zhang Meian, a standing committee member of the association, received them. The labor union put forward the preconditions of the group meetings. After a long period of mutual exchange of views, the trade association stated that the issue of substitute workers was an overall problem that needed to be resolved at the general membership meeting, resulting in no progress and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Branch Warnings. The various district branches of the pharmaceutical industry labor union sent letters to Feng Cunren yesterday, issuing a serious warning, limiting three days to fully resolve the preconditions put forward by the employees, otherwise, they will unanimously provide practical assistance as a final expression. At the same time, they also requested the labor union to immediately convene a general membership meeting of all Shanghai members to resolve everything. All the workers of Feng Cunren are extremely determined, vowing not to return to work until their demands are met, and held an emergency general meeting at 1 p.m. yesterday, resolving: (1) They will not return to work until the requested conditions are fully met. (2) They will not be swayed by any enticements or threats from the store, and they must achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Association General Meeting. The Chinese Medicine Trade Association, having previously resolved at an emergency executive committee meeting, will hold a general membership meeting tomorrow (the 5th) at 1 p.m. in the meeting hall at 242 Laobazi Road to discuss and respond to the three demands raised by the pharmaceutical industry labor union, and to re-elect the first term of committee members in accordance with the law. In addition to having requested the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send personnel to the venue for guidance, and having published notices and notified all members to attend, they also convened a preparatory meeting for the general meeting yesterday, resolving: (A) General meeting staff: Chairman group: Zhang Meian, Zhuang Meitang, Cen Zhiliang, Chen Chuxiang, Zhou Qiansheng; Master of Ceremonies: Chen Tiansheng; General Affairs: Sun Wenan; Reception Team Director: Cen Qisheng; Reception: Guo Baosheng, Niu Hegao, Song Fuchen, Xi Baisheng, Han Zhonghe, Zhang Zhihao; Discipline Team Director: Li Kangnian; Discipline: Cen Binghuang, Zhang Hongzhao, Yu Hegao, Fang Chang'an, Zhou Zhide, Shao Shilu, Wang Anquan; Recording: Zhang Junshu, Miao Shuchu, etc. (B) General meeting agenda: (1) The pharmaceutical industry vocational labor union raises four demands: (A) Continue to implement the substitute worker system as before; (B) Maintain the previously agreed upon labor-management conditions; (C) Demand a monthly salary increase of ten yuan per person; (D) Accept the placement of unemployed workers, etc. Please respond on how to handle the case. (2) How to assist in the case of the illegal strike by all employees of member Feng Cunren Hall? (3) How to handle the case of violating the order of the Central Training Department to delineate the boundaries between internal and external store employees in this industry? (4) How to expedite the revision of labor-management conditions in this industry as ordered by the Central Executive Committee? (5) Members propose multiple methods to deal with the labor unrest, requesting the general meeting to pass and implement the proposals. (6) Deliberate and decide on the executive committee for the first term, as well as the supplementary appointed committee members, and  the  committee members, please submit the resolution. Other various proposals related to the business of this industry are not related to this labor unrest, so they are not recorded. (C) All industry owners who are members of the association (limited to store owners) are specially allowed to attend and listen, but when these non-member industry owners attend, they must bring a certificate of proof, stamped with the store's bookkeeper's seal, and submit it to the general meeting staff for review before being allowed to attend. If permitted by the chairman, they may also express their opinions to gather ideas for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>Labor Union Rebuttal. The pharmaceutical industry vocational labor union, having recently received reports from various district branches refuting the proposals made by the members of the trade association's emergency general meeting, is now organizing and summarizing them into four points: (1) "Substitute Worker Issue": This case was a precondition for the labor-management dispute in 1928 and has the same legal effect as the labor-management contract signed in the same year. According to Announcement No. 2457 of the Social Bureau, store employees should first handle the matter in accordance with the existing labor-management agreements in various industries, which shows that the labor-management contract is still valid. Furthermore, Instruction No. 620 of the Municipal Executive Committee on June 30 of this year and the Municipal Party Headquarters' instruction to the Chinese Medicine Trade Association on February 26, 1931, sufficiently prove the continued validity of the original labor-management contract. No one can wantonly destroy it, and we should vow to fight for it. (2) "Salary Increase Issue": There is no restriction in the contract, but it is fundamentally not in conflict with the contract. There are three reasons: (A) The wages stipulated in the contract were set in 1928, and the increase in the cost of living over these years has invisibly increased the burden. From the perspective of the average income and expenditure in economics and the guarantee of human life, a salary increase is justified. (B) Capitalists seek profit with capital. Without the concerted efforts of those who work hard, how can they maintain or make a profit? Recently, the price of medicines has increased, and the business has flourished, but the compensation for workers remains the same. Isn't this filling the capitalists' desires to an extreme extent? The injustice is too great, so the labor side should argue reasonably. (C) From the standpoint of human evolution and business development, it is even more inappropriate to stick to old ways and should follow the trend of the times. Based on these three points, a salary increase is a legitimate demand, and all our workers should unanimously support it. The one-sided words of capitalists regarding facts and human relations are despised by informed people. There is no shortage of enlightened people in the world, and there will be public opinion. (3) "Placement Issue": Past placement movements have been the most outstanding achievements of the workers in this industry, demonstrating mutual assistance and solidarity, unlike capitalists who only seek their own self-interest. Moreover, the origin of placement is actually caused by capitalists destroying conditions, reducing manpower, arbitrarily hiring apprentices, dismissing employees without cause, and employing non-members, etc. Instead of repenting, they say that the labor union is destroying the capitalists' administration. It should be known that all past placements have been ordered by superiors. Are the superiors also destroying the capitalists' administration? The purpose of this placement is well-founded. Since the contract is valid, then all members should withdraw from the agreement of the conditions, and the replacement candidates should be those who have labor union membership, so the placement movement is justified. (4) "Conditions Issue": Before the labor-management contract is expressly abolished, it should be strictly observed. In this way, both parties know the old ways, and when discussing the future or amending it, both parties must agree. Now is not the time to use amendment as an excuse, which only shows that they are mentally exhausted. In short, we will never willingly give up solving the pain within the legal scope, and any sacrifice is insignificant. It is hoped that all circles will offer serious criticism. Who is right and who is wrong will be a matter of public opinion. If the capitalists do not make meaningless resistance, and the workers in this industry advocate peace, the storm can be calmed naturally.</p>
<p>Labor Union Opinions. The pharmaceutical industry labor union, due to the trade association's publication in yesterday's newspaper of opinions on the placement of substitute workers, also issued a strict statement as follows: (1) The substitute worker system originated in 1927 due to a labor-management dispute that resulted in a strike. At the time of the return to work, labor and management agreed on five preconditions (the third of which was the beginning of the substitute worker system). Later, Article 3 of the appendix to the labor-management contract signed in 1928 stated that the preconditions would continue to be valid. Now that the labor-management contract is legally permitted, it should be strictly enforced, and there is no doubt that the substitute worker system should be preserved. (2) Regarding the placement issue, we must investigate the source of unemployment. The creation of unemployment is actually caused by capitalists reducing manpower to save costs, arbitrarily hiring apprentices, dismissing employees without cause, and employing non-members, etc. Although placement has been implemented repeatedly, capitalists continue to create unemployment as before, and the number is increasing rather than decreasing. It is not the fundamental solution to not think about the root cause and instead think about the branches. The reason for the placement proposed by this union this time is that since the contract has been fulfilled, all non-members should withdraw uniformly, and unemployed workers who are members of this union should be used as replacements. (3) At the same time, it must be stated that the strike at Feng Ruitang was purely voluntary and not subject to the union's direction. The trade association's malicious slander is obviously intended to undermine the union, and in addition to sending a warning letter, we are also making a statement to all circles. (4) The capitalists falsely accuse this union of privately selling certificates as a cause of unemployment. Where is the factual evidence? It should be known that if this union wants to solicit workers from other places to join this union, it can certainly do so publicly. Why would it privately sell certificates? This malicious slander is obviously intended to undermine the reputation of this union and should be resolved in accordance with the law. From this alone, the capitalists have evaded their responsibility for the source of unemployment, which shows their forcible argument to cover up their mistakes.</p>
<h3>The Coal Industry Trade Association Prohibits the Sale of Japanese Coal</h3>
<p>Confirmed to have gathered at the Tianchan Teahouse</p>
<p>Now has subsided and is nearing invisible extinction</p>
<p>The Municipal Coal Industry Trade Association, upon receiving a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to prohibit the sale of Japanese coal, immediately investigated and sought to dissuade the practice. The exchange of letters is recorded below: (1) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce letter to the Coal Industry Trade Association stated:</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Respectfully, we have received a confidential letter from Zhang Fusheng stating that there are endless traitors in the coal industry. Recently, they have gone from secret to public, selling Japanese coal. They used to do so in the coal market during the Spring Festival. Now, fearing that the Coal Industry Trade Association would prohibit it, they have had the audacity to change the location to the Tianchan Teahouse on Xizang Road and Fourth Avenue, establishing a central hub for the sale of Japanese coal. We hereby inform you and request that your association order the teahouse not to rent the market to unscrupulous merchants, otherwise they will be considered as colluding with traitors. As for the few in the Coal Industry Trade Association who do not understand the greater good and collude with unscrupulous merchants, your association should also send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation to rectify the rules of the association, etc. We are urgently recording and forwarding this case and hope that your association will thoroughly investigate and strictly prohibit the practice to avoid criticism. We earnestly hope for this. (2) The Coal Industry Trade Association replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: We have received your important letter regarding the prohibition of unscrupulous merchants from establishing a separate market for Japanese coal, etc. We hereby inform you that we have investigated and confirmed that there are indeed unscrupulous merchants in this industry gathering at the Tianchan Teahouse to conduct Japanese coal transactions, but this is a secret act, and we have learned that they have slightly subsided and are nearing invisible extinction. We appreciate your concern and specially send this letter in reply.</p>

<h3>The China Cotton Improvement Association Held its First Annual Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<p>Meetings will continue for the next two days.</p>
<p>The China Cotton Improvement Association held its first annual meeting at 80 Edward Road yesterday. More than fifty representatives attended, passed the agenda, and elected proposal review committee members. Each representative gave a report and speech. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Lu Feizhi and Xu Hanchu from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry; Zhang Fancai from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction; Li Guozhen from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Construction and the Provincial Cotton Field; Fang Junqiang from the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction, the Zhejiang Provincial Cotton Field, and Nanjing University Agricultural College; Xie Jiasheng from Nanjing University Agricultural College; Feng Zhaozhong, Feng Zigang, and Mo Dingsen from National Central University Agricultural College; Wang Zhiqing from Zhejiang University Agricultural College; Zhao Lianfang from Henan University Agricultural College; Wang Rumin from the Zhengding Cotton Field of the Hebei Department of Industry; Sun Enqing from Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau; Ye Yuanding from Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau; Yang Xiantong from the Hubei Cotton Industry Committee; Hu Jingliang from the Hunan Provincial Department of Construction and the Provincial Cotton Field; Wu Weijing from the Zhejiang Cotton Field; Zhu Jinshou from the Jiangsu Provincial First Cotton Field; Nie Lusheng, Zhang Zemin, and Jiang Dixian from the Yarn Factory Association; and more than fifty people from various provincial agricultural and cotton fields, etc.</p>
<p>Committee Members' Addresses: The meeting began at 9 a.m., with Nie Lusheng, Fang Junqiang, and Sun Enqing serving as the chair group. Nie Lusheng delivered the opening address, stating that the association's first annual meeting was originally scheduled for March 21, but was postponed to today due to the January 28 Incident. Last year, the Chinese cotton harvest was poor, resulting in the value of imported cotton ranking last among imported goods. China is a country based on agriculture, but now both cotton and wheat rely on imports, which is a great pity. The government authorities deeply feel that China's future lies not in guns and cannons, but in the progress of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Improving cotton production is the most important of agricultural products. The responsibility of those engaged in improving cotton planting is very great. If the association's methods can be practical, it will be more beneficial than building warships and purchasing guns.</p>
<p>Reports from All Parties: Sun Enqing, representative of the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, reported on the cotton inspection situation and cotton production status in Tianjin. Next, Fang Junqiang reported on the association's work over the past year. Nie Lusheng reported that the general meeting had received 25 proposals.

<h3>The Industrial and Commercial Revival Association of the Disaster Area Asks to Prohibit Landlords from Extorting Small Rents</h3>
<p>So that the prosperity of the disaster area can be seen as soon as possible. The Industrial and Commercial Revival Association of the Disaster Area yesterday submitted a request to the Municipal Government to prohibit landlords in the disaster area from extorting small rents. The submission stated: It is submitted to request the prohibition of landlords in the disaster area from extorting small rents and increasing rents, and to ask for consideration. According to the case of Zhang Dalian, member of the committee, it is proposed to ask for consideration of four revival opinions. A copy of Zhang Dalian's original opinions is attached. It is found that the sections mentioned in the first item are indeed unavoidable, and since the disaster, the commerce of Zhabei has been almost completely destroyed. Now is the time to work together to seek revival, so that the prosperity of the disaster area can be seen as soon as possible. If the landlords are ignorant of this meaning and extort increases, then investors will be hesitant, and Zhabei commerce will never be revived. Thinking about the future is very painful. Therefore, it was submitted to the second executive committee meeting of the association, and it was resolved to submit a request to your government to issue a notice to prohibit (2) the rent reduction movement committee, (3) advise the Real Estate Association, and the remaining three items will be submitted to the design committee for review after the design committee is established. The record of the various situations is on file. In addition to handling them separately, we should prepare a document and attach the original opinions for submission to your government, and we sincerely ask for consideration and approval of the request. This would be a great convenience.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting Proposal of Hongkou Groups</h3>
<p>Please Request the City Government to Promulgate Rent Exemption Measures</p>
<p>Representatives to be Sent Today to Petition</p>
<p>The Hongkou District Branches of the Citizens' Federation, and over twenty groups from the Joint Business Associations of Yangshupu Road, Jiaxing Road, Dongyouheng Road, Hansbury Road, East and West Huade Road, East and West Broadway Road, Huade Road, Yinxiang Road, Haining Road, Edinburgh Road, Fusheng Road, Baotong Road, Baoxing Road, Yokohama Road, Tiantong Road, North Fujian Road, North Jiangxi Road, North Xizang Road, and North Xinjiang Road, held their fourteenth joint meeting to discuss the uneven rent exemptions north of Suzhou Road, which have led to increasing disputes lately, affecting market stability and easing the burden on the people. Considering the difficulties faced by the people of Suzhou, it is appropriate to appeal to the city government to issue rent exemption measures. Therefore, representatives such as Zhang Xianfang, Wang Rongtang, Zhu Zhichun, Cai Qiajun, Shi Jiulin, Zhou Fuzhang, and Fei Liangheng have been selected to submit a petition today at the city government, hoping for early implementation to comfort the weeping anticipation of all citizens. The petition is recorded as follows: To Mayor Wu, the petition is to relieve the market, regulate finance, and reduce rent to ease the burden on the people. We urge you to review and quickly promulgate measures to reduce and exempt rent in order to maintain people's livelihoods. Our associations and other places are located north of the Suzhou River. Since the January 28th incident, the area has been ravaged by war, businesses have been shut down, and industries have ceased. The Hongkou area has been in this state for three months. After the war, the once prosperous market scene has become desolate. Commercial depression and financial emergency are truly unimaginable. Considering that rent is one of the three necessities of life—clothing, food, and housing—everyone bears the burden. Therefore, in order to regulate finance, maintain the market, and reduce rent to alleviate the suffering of the people, according to rent reduction and exemption, there have been precedents after the European War and the Japanese earthquake. Even the 京杭 [Kyoto-Hangzhou] areas of this current incident have all implemented such measures. Shanghai is a war zone and should implement these measures. The citizens hope for rent exemptions and relief. We hope that exemption measures will be promulgated for compliance. However, many landlords in this area have voluntarily exempted rent. For those who cannot agree or whose exemptions are insufficient, disputes are increasing daily. We are requesting rent exemption measures to resolve member disputes, especially considering the Mayor's personal suffering, and maintaining so as not to cause disturbances, to maintain stability. Therefore, we should recommend representatives to petition, hoping for swift implementation.</p>

<h3>Chinese Tram Workers Petition to Managing Directors</h3>
<p>Enlarged Meeting Presents Four Demands. Following the labor dispute at the Shanghai Chinese Tram Company, two individuals petitioned the directors the night before last, creating a tense situation. The company responded that Zhu Shao Yi's case would be decided by the board of directors tomorrow. Consequently, the workers expressed dissatisfaction, presented wage increase demands, and issued a declaration. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Workers Petition Directors. At 5 PM the day before yesterday (the 2nd), the labor union, in response to a notification from the company's board of directors, sent representatives Tan Honglin, Hu Yida, Zhao Sanyuan, and others to meet with managing directors Wang Yiting and Gu Xinyi. Simultaneously, over 300 workers spontaneously gathered and went along to demand a response to the dismissal of Zhu Shao Yi. Upon hearing this, the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched an armed police squad to maintain order. Manager Lu Bohong and managing directors Wang Yiting and others advised the workers and declared that the company would handle the dispute peacefully with a fair and impartial attitude, using its reputation and credibility as a guarantee. However, the workers continued to demand an immediate response. As the number of workers increased, the situation became more serious. To prevent any accidents, the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched an additional 50 armed police officers from the First Squad, along with four patrol cars. Chief Zhang Dongkai of the Second District Police Station personally led Inspector Fan Zhongliang and others to maintain order. By 9 PM, Manager Lu Bohong issued a notice stating, "Based on the reports from the workers, Zhu Shao Yi, head of the car department, should be dismissed. The board of directors will make a final decision on this matter on the 5th of this month. This is hereby announced." After receiving this notice, the labor union expressed dissatisfaction, stating that they would not leave until Zhu Shao Yi was dismissed. After persuasion from the police officers of the Public Security Bureau, they finally withdrew in formation, shouting slogans.</p>
<p>Organizing an Enlarged Meeting. As the workload has become increasingly heavy recently, the existing directors were unable to handle it all. Therefore, an enlarged meeting was specially organized with 31 committee members. In addition to the original directors, the remaining members were selected by the various branches. The committee established a presidium of seven people and three sections, including a secretary, propaganda, and organization, to handle daily affairs. It also established inspectors, transportation, propaganda, investigation, staff members, and team members, creating a very tight organization.</p>
<p>Presenting Four Demands. The enlarged committee convened a plenary meeting yesterday afternoon (the 3rd). In addition to discussing work issues, it also passed four new conditions, deciding to inform the board of directors and request a satisfactory response within three days. The conditions are listed below: (1) Demand a general wage increase with the following standards: (A) A 10% increase for those with a monthly salary of 90 yuan or more; (B) A 25% increase for those with a monthly salary of 50 yuan or more; (C) A 30% increase for those with a monthly salary of 36 yuan or more; (D) A 40% increase for those with a monthly salary of 21 yuan or more; (E) A 55% increase for those with a monthly salary of 20 yuan or less. (2) Apprentices receive a stipend of 14 yuan in their first year with the company, 16 yuan in their second year, and 18 yuan in their third year. After three years, the minimum wage is 25 yuan. Existing apprentices who have not reached this amount will have their wages supplemented according to their years of service, starting from the month the conditions are signed. (3) The company usually provides two months of bonus at the end of the year. Starting from 1932, all workers who have worked for more than one year will receive two months' salary, and those who have worked for less than one year will receive one month's salary. Workers who resign or are dismissed will also be given the same bonus at the time of resignation or dismissal. Apprentices will be treated the same way. (4) The old-age pension for officers and the permanent education fund for workers should be combined and distributed proportionally.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Industry Department Holds Fishery Guidance Meeting in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province's coastal areas are rich in marine products. However, coastal fishermen adhere to old habits, do not know how to improve, and are plagued by coastal bandits internally and invaded by Japanese fishing boats externally, leading to a daily decline in production and increasingly difficult livelihoods for fishermen. In order to improve coastal fishery facilities and effectively guide fishermen, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry has successively established provincial-level fishery test and demonstration grounds since October 1931, with fishery guidance stations attached to Chongming Island of 嵊山 [Shengshan], the Changshu Department of Agriculture demonstration farm, with a fishery guidance station attached to 浒浦 [Hupu], the 启东 [Qidong] County Agriculture demonstration farm with a fishery guidance station attached to 吕四 [Lusi], the Rugao Agriculture demonstration farm with a fishery guidance station attached to 北坎 [Beikan]. In addition, fishery guidance stations are under construction in 等 [Deng]. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry convened a meeting of responsible personnel from provincial and county fishery guidance stations at the provincial level Shanghai office on the day before yesterday and yesterday. Attendees included Department of Industry representative Hou Zhaohai, Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Extension Committee technician and fishery instructor Jin Zhiquan, Provincial Fishery Test and Research Ground director Wang Wentai, Marine Survey Institute inspector Chen Shoushou, and Shengshan Nantong Rugao Changshu fishery guidance station directors Wang Liansheng, Wang Gang, Xu Bu, Jin Yongxiao, etc. The meeting was chaired by Department of Industry representative Hou Zhaohai, recorded by Wang Liansheng, and opened as scheduled. First, the chairman reported the main reasons for the Department of Industry's convening of the meeting: (1) To inquire about the fishery and guidance situation in various places; (2) To determine the matters that should be emphasized in the next year; (3) To determine the cooperation and public appointment methods in the province's fishery guidance. He also explained that the Department considered coastal fisheries as a special industry, as important as afforestation on the Beijing-Hangzhou lines, and discussed budget methods, etc. Next, the directors of the Shengshan, Nantong, Rugao, and Changshu fishery guidance stations reported on their guidance work, this year's fishing situation, the fishery environment, and matters they plan to emphasize next year. Next, Jin Zhiquan expressed his opinion that the two most difficult points for the various guidance stations are: (1) Insufficient talent; (2) Economic panic. He suggested finding ways to provide relief. Next, Wang Wentai expressed his opinion that only four counties in the province have established fishery guidance stations, which is not as widespread as cotton, sericulture, rice, and wheat, which are listed as major industries, which is a shame for our fishery colleagues. He suggested adopting appropriate methods to awaken the public and seek universal development, and establishing laws and regulations so that counties and farms can find ways to broadly raise funds for fishery guidance stations. Finally, the chairman reported on the budget preparation situation for 1932: (1) The provincial farm and provincial fishery guidance station expenses have not yet been reviewed by the provincial government; (2) The expenses of the county fishery guidance stations are determined based on 15% of the agricultural improvement mu tax in each county; (3) If the funds are insufficient, the county farms will make up for the shortfall according to 1931 standards; (4) The 1932 budget of each guidance station should add two fishery trainees with a total monthly salary of 40 yuan. As for the maintenance funding method, in addition to the fishery patrol instructors going to various counties to conduct detailed investigations of funding conditions and assist in urging payment, local people should also be asked for assistance. After discussion, it was resolved: (1) Please request the Department of Industry to add one fishery guidance station each in Haizhou and Songjiang at the northern and southern ends of Jiangsu Province's coast; (2) According to the former Department of Agriculture and Mining's regulations, unify the fishery survey form style and the fishery village outline surveyed by the Shengshan Fishery Guidance Station, revise them, and order all fishery guidance stations to conduct unified surveys in three phases (three months per phase), and have patrol instructors review them as a preparation for publishing the overall outer sea fishery situation of the province; (3) Matters that each guidance station should have in the first phase (up to the end of 1932) are divided into (A) liaison equipment and (B) individual equipment; (4) Fishery guidance facilities and preparations: (A) Edit aquatic product knowledge and distribute it to fishermen, merchants, and various industries; (B) Print aquatic product posters and nautical charts. For the three types of fishing boat posters from the former Department of Agriculture and Mining, please ask the Extension Committee to reprint 3,000 copies of each type, and have the Provincial Fishery Test and Research Ground design and reprint three more types; (5) Common precautions for each fishery guidance station: (A) Survey items: During important fishing seasons, each fishery guidance station should send personnel to the fishing grounds to conduct detailed surveys of the following items: fishing season, fishing ground location, water temperature (upper, middle, and lower layers), water depth, bottom quality, current (direction, speed, time), specific gravity, transparency, plankton, weather, wind direction, wind force, air pressure, air temperature, catch per net, catch (size, sex ratio, gonad maturity, type), daily observations, at least three times day and night; (B) Each county fishery guidance station should focus on measuring the amount of water on the coastal beaches of each county; (C) Starting from 1932, select appropriate trainees to concurrently study radio navigation, surveying, specimen production, fishing boat machinery, and drawing ship diagrams and shipbuilding; (D) Contact and rent large pairs of boats to test pair trawling; (E) The Hai Xing fishing boat must select Jiangsu fishermen for training and be hired by the test ground; (6) Each fishery guidance station should focus on the following items: (A) Shengshan Fishery Guidance Station: (1) Focus on improving the fishing villages on the outer sea islands, and use Shengshan and Gouqi Islands as experimental areas. The Department should initiate the organization of a committee to improve the fishing villages on the outer sea islands; (2) Conduct fixed ocean observations; (B) Changshu County Fishery Guidance Station: Focus on establishing fishermen's clubs and fishermen's reading rooms during the fishing season, promoting fishermen's savings, planning model fish markets, planning the development of fishery economy and marketing, and conducting fixed observation surveys of the Yangtze River water; Investigate the fisheries along the Yangtze River, investigate the economic conditions of outer sea fisheries, and pay attention to economic connections with nearby ports; (C) Nantong County Fishery Guidance Station focuses on the improvement of fixed fisheries (starting with offshore netting), planning the improvement of Pengjiatao fishing village, and fishermen's education and self-defense; (D) Rugao County Fishery Guidance Station focuses on the improvement of small yellow croaker seine nets and dried products, and promotes seine nets and drag nets; (E) Yancheng County Fishery Guidance Station focuses on the improvement of Huachuan Port fishing village, and pays attention to the training of fishermen in offshore fisheries.</p>
<h3>Jiyi Charity Association Hongkou Epidemic Hospital Opens</h3>

It is heard that the hospital has more than 300 beds, and can accommodate up to 500 people if there is an insufficient supply. There are already hundreds of patients in the hospital, and the number of outpatients in the past half month has exceeded 3,000. This is truly a rare charitable work, and its future development is limitless. At 5 o'clock, the guests and hosts went to the playground of Chengzong School to take a group photo to commemorate the occasion, and then dispersed happily.</p>

<h3>Shooting Murder out of Jealousy</h3>
<p>Affair for Money</p>
<p>Life Not Guaranteed When Money Runs Out</p>
<p>At about 2 PM yesterday, a shooting assassination occurred in the French Concession's Xiaodongmen Yuxing Street due to jealousy. The lover was in critical condition, and the murderer was caught on the spot. Detailed information from the day before yesterday is described below:</p>
<p>Ambiguous Past. Wang Xingsheng, a local man, studied carpentry. He is over thirty years old and married Fan, whose given name is Zhen Da, age 26. They live together at No. 2 Wangjiazhai, Gaolang Bridge, Yangshupu. However, Wang is naturally vagrant, does not engage in honest work, and has a reputation for being a rascal. Their life is quite difficult. Fan, seeing that her husband is not good, began to hate him due to poverty. She became intimate with Yao Guishan, a local man of 35 years of age, who is in the rattan business. This happened four years ago.</p>
<p>Friends in Appearance. When Yao and Fan became intimate, Xingsheng was well aware of the matter. Later, Yao sold ancestral land, obtaining more than 2,000 yuan. Xingsheng then pretended to be deaf and dumb, while using Fan to flatter Yao in every possible way. Yao then fell into the trap, and the money he obtained was gradually induced and exhausted by Fan. Over the years, Wang and Yao have remained friends in appearance, but the affair has been widely rumored in the Gaolang Bridge area.</p>
<p>Kidney Punctured. Recently, Xingsheng saw that Yao's economy was also becoming increasingly tight, but it was impossible to make Fan break away from him. At 1:20 PM yesterday, Yao and Fan took a tram to the 16th Pier, intending to go to a hotel for a secret meeting. When they were walking side by side to the door of No. 33 Yuxing Street fish stack, Wang Xingsheng suddenly jumped out from behind, flashed a pistol, and fired two shots at Yao's back. One bullet hit Yao's buttocks, puncturing the kidney.</p>
<p>Couple Detained. Yao immediately fell to the ground after being shot, blood gushing out like a fountain. The murderer, Wang Xingsheng, immediately called two rickshaws, and fled east with Fan. At that time, a gunshot rang out, and passers-by gathered. Detectives arrived and pursued east. As a result, detectives Nos. 138 (Western), 217 (Western), and 529 (Chinese) intercepted Wang and Fan near Xinkai River, seized the pistol, and immediately took Yao Guishan and the couple to the police station. After the detectives briefly questioned them, they ordered detective No. 748 (Chinese) to send Yao to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, due to the critical injury, his life may be in danger. The murderer and his wife were temporarily detained pending trial in court.</p>
<h3>Old Maid Meets Gigolo, Commits Suicide Out of Shame and Anger</h3>
<p>Gigolo Apprehended After the Fact</p>
<p>Court Should Punish Severely</p>
<p>Xu Aqiao, a woman from Changshu, 27 years old, was betrothed to a man from the same village, but had not yet married. Although Xu came from a farming family, she was beautiful and elegant, unlike women from small families. She also loved to dress up. Therefore, the village rustic husband was an ill match. At the age of 21, she secretly came to Shanghai and lived with her relative and fellow villager, Mrs. Tang Zhang, at No. 21 Gaozhao Lane, Xinzha Road, vowing to remain single. However, she could not burden her relatives with living expenses. Therefore, in recent years, she worked as a servant in a certain place, saving a little money. She wore gold rings and dressed luxuriously. Xue Youyu, a gigolo from Wuxi, just over twenty years old and still unmarried, worked at the hardware bookshelf store established by his brother Youqing at No. 2095 Guangxing Lane, North Jiangxi Road. Seeing that his brother was wandering and lazy, his brother’s words were unpleasant to his ears, and his teachings were ineffective. After the Dragon Boat Festival, his brother made him find his own place to live. Youyu has become more and more depraved ever since, always with groups of bad friends, looking for pleasure and flirting with women, either staying in hotels or in friends' houses, specializing in ripping off women. Xu Aqiao and Xue Youyu met in his brother's hardware store. She was seduced by all kinds of seductions and fell into the trap. She was tricked into the Jinbu Hotel on Maigen Road, where they had illicit relations several times. Through sweet words and honeyed phrases, he gradually took all the hundreds of silver dollars and gold rings she had accumulated, leaving her with nothing. Xu had not seen Xue Youyu's whereabouts recently. There was no news, fearing that he had found another love and would abandon her. Therefore, the day before yesterday, she rushed to the hardware store to inquire, and learned that he had been dismissed by his brother long ago, and had not returned. Recalling that her virginity had been taken as an old maid, and all her money had been taken away, she could not help but weep and feel extremely frustrated. It was truly an unspeakable pain. Just as she was feeling ashamed and angry, she happened to meet his brother Xue Youqing, who was stumbling along Xinzha Road. Xu, extremely resentful, twisted him into the police station, and had to reluctantly reveal that she had been scammed by his brother, demanding to arrest Xue Youyu and fight him to the death. The police chief, learning the truth, was also very pitiful, but the brother could not bear this responsibility, and was released immediately. She was persuaded by the police chief to go home. Xu Aqiao had no way, and returned to Mrs. Tang Zhang's place, speechless. The more she thought about it, the more ashamed she became. She secretly bought opium and brought it back, swallowed it at midnight, and lay down covered with a quilt. After a while, the poison took effect and she groaned. After being discovered by Mrs. Zhang, she was sent to Guangren Hospital. She died despite medical treatment. The body was taken to the Filun Road morgue. Yesterday, Guo Wei, prosecutor of the First Special District Court, went to the morgue to examine the body and confirmed that Xu Aqiao died of opium poisoning. The body was handed over to her brother Xu Shunan to be put in a coffin and buried. Xue Youyu, also known as Sanmao, was also arrested by the Xinzha police station and brought to justice. Guo ordered that Xu Aqiao died of opium poisoning and the body should be returned to her brother Xu Shunan for coffin and burial. Xue Sanmao is suspected of committing a crime and should be prosecuted by the police station.</p>
<h3>Wusong Chamber of Commerce Requests Prompt Repair of Seawall</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuchi, director of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, stated that the Songkou seawall has been repeatedly damaged by Japanese artillery fire. From Paotaiwan in the east to the Yunzaobang area in the west, everything was broken and collapsed. Recalling the last year's surge, Songkou almost became a swamp. At that time, several sections had collapsed, and fortunately, the Public Works Bureau sent workers to rush to repair them, so that the residents could be preserved. Now the autumn tide is approaching, but the destroyed seawall has not been repaired. This project cannot be delayed any longer. If a huge tide rises suddenly, Songkou will be in a precarious situation. Moreover, the soil on the Outer Ma Road is loose and there are thousands of cracks. Residents are worried when they see this situation. Therefore, Director Zhang submitted the above situation in a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting it to be forwarded to the Municipal Government, ordering the Public Works Bureau to repair the seawall from scratch, so that it can be resolved once and for all to secure the lives of the people.</p>
<h3>Batavia Chamber of Commerce Prevents Inferior Goods from Impersonating Domestic Products</h3>
<p>Can Register with Local Government First. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the United Association of Domestic Machinery Factories of this city, saying: The Batavia Chinese General Chamber of Commerce wrote that products from our country sold in Nanyang have become increasingly developed in recent years, and the progress of domestic products is already admirable. However, it is a pity that our overseas Chinese are of mixed quality, and some unscrupulous merchants seek only profit, and actually change the trademarks of inferior goods to impersonate domestic products, or send domestic products to the East to imitate and package them, and counterfeit trademarks, and transport them to Nanyang. Their crime of deceiving overseas Chinese is unforgivable, and the damage to domestic products is even more hateful. The organization is now thoroughly investigating and devising methods of sanctions. However, according to the fundamental method in law, each factory in the country should register its trademark with the Dutch government for products sold in the Dutch East Indies. If counterfeiting is discovered, the police can be asked to seal up and punish them immediately. The registration fee for each trademark is about 40 Dutch guilders. If each factory does not have a formal agent, it can entrust our association to handle everything. For this reason, please inform all factories in your port of the above situation and ask them to pay attention to the goods sold in Nanyang, so that the counterfeiting of unscrupulous merchants can be prevented, and the future of domestic products will be secured, etc. In view of this, it is appropriate to record the letter and forward it. Please check and inform all affiliated factories to comply.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan's Report on Flood Relief</h3>
<p>(4) Yi Labor Relief The Labor Relief Office has appointed Mr. Xi Jun Dejiong as its director to handle labor relief matters. The disaster area is vast, and the destruction is immense, extending across the regions of the Jiang, Huai, Yun, Han, Ying, Luo, Xiang, and Yuan rivers. In the past, the government established organizations for consolidation, provincial governments set up special water conservancy bureaus, and county administrations established levee work directorates. These were normally regarded as projects for preparedness, but now the responsibility suddenly falls upon this group. The gravity and difficulty of this responsibility would surely give anyone pause. Moreover, local customs and habits differ, so the sustenance for disaster relief workers is uneven. The nature of the work varies, making the management of disaster relief labor difficult. The strength of the workers differs, resulting in inconsistent work efficiency. The tools and equipment vary, leading to different outcomes. All these factors, with their myriad complexities, required much discussion before regulations could be established and implemented. The work procedure is roughly as follows: (1) Technical Committee: Water conservancy engineering is a specialized field. The bends in the river course, the magnitude of flow, the speed of current, and the height of the water level are all closely related to the construction of embankments. Undertaking work without surveying or careful examination would inevitably waste resources and create future problems. Therefore, a technical committee was established, inviting Chinese and foreign experts as members. All embankment and sluice gate projects must undergo review and design by this committee before implementation. (2) Labor Relief Bureaus and Sections: These organizations also employ personnel with specialized knowledge and experience to serve as bureau chiefs, engineers, section chiefs, and other positions to implement the work. Every day, in barren and desolate areas, under the scorching sun and pouring rain, they interact with ignorant and unrefined people, diligently building embankments and levees. All those who enjoy the benefits of these structures are indebted to these individuals. (3) Division of Labor with Local Governments and Organizations: Due to geographical and personnel differences, labor relief methods vary. Some involve joint efforts with provincial governments, such as the canal embankment project in Jiangsu. Some involve allocating relief funds directly to those responsible for management, such as the canal projects along the canal in Shandong. Some involve local governments and gentry agreeing to borrow funds and take responsibility for the work themselves, such as the repair of embankments in eleven lakeside counties in Hunan. In other cases, the Labor Relief Office devises methods and dispatches personnel to take charge. Regarding earthwork, most bureaus and sections have completed about eight-tenths of the work to date. Any delays due to other unavoidable circumstances are being addressed by the Labor Relief Office, with a deadline of the end of July for completion. However, the construction of culverts and sluice gates cannot be undertaken until the earthwork is completed. The achievements of each bureau and section, the amount of funds used, and charts of completed work will be statistically reported after the final conclusion. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Pudong Native Place Association Collects Donations for Northeastern Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The Pudong Native Place Association's public announcement for collecting donations for the Northeastern Volunteer Army states: Since the Japanese invaders attacked Shenyang on September 18th, they have captured the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang in just a few days. This is indeed due to the Chinese warlords' persistent belief that the Chinese army could not fight against the Japanese invaders, which led them to choose non-resistance. After the Japanese invaders occupied the three northeastern provinces, they became arrogant and overbearing, and then there was the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. They also made empty boasts in Fuzhou and Hankou, claiming that they could completely occupy Shanghai in four hours. Unexpectedly, our 19th Route Army came out to resist and fought fiercely for thirty-four days, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Although the markets in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong were razed to the ground, and houses were turned into ashes, with incalculable losses for the people, the reputation of Japan as a first-class power was swept away from that point on. Our country, which had been looked down upon by others, now has a slightly more respectable international standing. Even the soldiers who feared the enemy like tigers now know that the Japanese invaders' tricks are nothing more than that, and their morale is growing stronger and more courageous. The Japanese invaders, unable to succeed in disturbing Shanghai, are now willing to cease fire and withdraw their troops, using all their strength to invade the Northeast. Alas, is the government's overall plan viewing the three northeastern provinces as its own private possession, not as part of China? Is the so-called long-term resistance just an excuse for non-resistance? The three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang are the northeastern shield of China. As the saying goes, "The chariot and the rail depend on each other," and "If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold." The Japanese invaders are occupying the three northeastern provinces, using the old trick of destroying Korea, using Chinese traitors, playing with Puyi, and establishing the puppet Manchurian state. Now the government's declaration to suppress the puppet state has again become empty words, and it cannot be realized. Alas, the three northeastern provinces will no longer be ours! The people within the customs, if they have other intentions and willingly become compliant subjects of the Japanese invaders, then so be it. Otherwise, if the three northeastern provinces fall, I fear that the entire country will follow suit in a few years. Fortunately, the Northeastern Volunteer Army has risen up, following General Ma Zhanshan, vowing to kill the enemy. They can fight against airplanes, bombs, and artillery with broadswords and rifles. The number of deaths and injuries is about one to ten. They are ashamed to be slaves of a fallen country, preferring to be ghosts under the sword, just like the 19th Route Army fighting in Shanghai before. This ambition and this heart are worthy of praise and tears. The 19th Route Army was able to defeat the Japanese invaders, partly because the soldiers were brave in battle, and partly because the people helped with materials. This is recognized by both Chinese and foreigners. The people of Pudong, including the business and industrial communities in Shanghai, have always been known for their public spirit and righteousness. Looking at their enthusiastic donations to the 19th Route Army, they vied to be first, fearing they would be left behind. At this critical moment of survival, the success or failure of the Northeastern Volunteer Army is a matter of life and death for our people. The Book of Changes says, "When you tread on frost, you know that solid ice is near." The Zuo Zhuan says, "Greed will bring misfortune upon us." We, the undersigned, have been thinking it over and over, and it is difficult to sit idly by. We have specially followed the example of various organizations in Shanghai and are engaging in soliciting donations. No matter how much or how little, every little helps. The goal is to be sure to do it, and there should be no delay. If the country is broken, where will the home be? What can be done if the invaders are deep? We hope that our elders, brothers, uncles, and aunts will save on food and clothing and enthusiastically contribute to comfort the soldiers and express their responsibility as citizens. This is the announcement.</p>
<p>Methods: (1) Donations are limited to cash. (2) Donations, regardless of the amount, should be sent by the fundraiser to the Pudong Bank (No. 1 Sijing Road, Shanghai Public Concession) for collection, and a receipt will be issued. (3) As soon as 1,000 yuan is collected, it will be remitted. (4) Fundraising will begin immediately, and the deadline will be decided and notified when appropriate. (5) After the conclusion, a micro-record will be published or announced in the newspaper, but it may be announced at any time if it is deemed necessary, and it will be audited and certified by an accountant.</p>
<h3>Rice Distribution by the Unemployed Workers Relief Association</h3>
<p>Today in the Eastern District of Shanghai</p>
<p>Inside the Taiping Temple on Lan Road</p>
<p>The Municipal War Zone Unemployed Workers Relief Association has been issuing rice purchase vouchers in the Zhabei and Pudong districts since July 1st. As of yesterday, more than 370 vouchers had been issued in the Zhabei district, and more than 1,720 vouchers had been issued in the Pudong district. However, at around 3:00 PM yesterday, while vouchers were being issued in the Pudong district, about 300 to 400 unregistered unemployed workers suddenly swarmed to the voucher distribution point, surrounded the staff, and demanded rice vouchers. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, the voucher distribution staff quickly hid the remaining vouchers. The Third District Police Station was notified and immediately dispatched a chief officer to the scene to suppress the situation and escort the staff to the ferry, so that they could safely escape. According to the person in charge of the association, who spoke to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, more than 2,400 unemployed workers were previously registered in the Pudong district. The number of people who have received vouchers this time has reached two-thirds. Some of the others have returned to their hometowns, and some cannot prove they are eligible to receive vouchers because they have lost their registration certificates. Furthermore, the association will begin issuing rice vouchers in the Eastern District of Shanghai tomorrow. Originally, the Shanghai Eastern District Commune was designated as the voucher distribution point, but now, because the school attached to the commune is still in session, which is inconvenient, it has been changed to the Taiping Temple on Lan Road, which was the previous registration location. Unemployed workers in the district can go to that location with their registration certificates to receive vouchers.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jilan's Case of Selling National Territory</h3>
<p>The Gaoqiao Municipal Committee submitted a petition requesting a thorough investigation of Zhong Yuliang, a member of the Gaoqiao Municipal Council. In the past, Zhang Jin'feng used the guise of public welfare to forcibly buy people's land and sell it to the Japanese, which severely harmed national rights. Evidence was presented and a request was made to deal with the matter according to the law. Yesterday, another document was submitted to the municipal government, stating that the land illegally seized by Zhang Jilan, also known as Zhang Jin'feng, should be confiscated and allocated to post-war relief in the war zone to benefit disaster victims and warn treacherous elements. It is noted that Zhang Jilan, also known as Zhang Jin'feng, in November of the tenth year of the Republic (1921), used the guise of establishing schools, factories, and public welfare undertakings to deceive the Baoshan County Office into issuing a proclamation to forcibly seize more than 230 mu of people's land in the Yin Jiu and Yin Shi areas of Jiangwan. Then, using the name of Cheng Ji Company, he leased it to the Japanese as a ball field and mortgaged the land deed to a Japanese bank under a false name. This was essentially colluding with foreigners and selling the land in disguise, from which he made huge profits. In October of the eighteenth year (1929), the government ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest Zhang Jilan and send him to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation, and ordered the Land Bureau to declare the illegal seizure of land invalid. However, the court's investigation was not thorough enough and it hastily issued a decision not to prosecute. The government then sent a letter to the court requesting a review, and the committee submitted two photographs of the conclusive evidence of Zhang Jilan's forced seizure of people's land to the government for forwarding to the court for thorough investigation. The investigation is still on file. Now, following the order to clear land in the war zone, all of Zhang Jilan's illegally seized land is in the most severely affected area of the war zone. His use of the guise of public welfare, borrowing the power of government offices, forcing the people, colluding with foreigners, and seizing huge profits are all supported by solid evidence. It is requested that the government immediately confiscate all of this land and allocate it to relief efforts in the war zone, and to expedite the Shanghai Local Court's strict handling of the matter according to the law, in order to benefit disaster victims and warn treacherous elements. This special document is submitted for review and implementation.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union</h3>
<p>The declaration of the representatives' meeting of the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union states: Since the outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai War, the Sanyou Industrial Company, citing losses as an excuse, has delayed resuming work. Our union has made repeated declarations, hoping to gain the understanding of all sectors. Now, the company first used the relationship with the current situation to announce a temporary suspension, then moved machinery while falsely claiming damage, and finally delayed resuming work due to huge losses. With all kinds of tricks, they deceived the party and government. On June 30th, the municipal government issued an instruction stating: "Received. This case has been investigated by the Social Affairs Bureau, and this government has instructed the company that, since it did not formally declare bankruptcy at the time and did not complete the dismissal procedures according to law, it should be ordered to quickly find a way to resume work. However, according to the company's repeated reports, the losses are huge and it is impossible to fully restore the work situation in a short time, which has been verified as true. Some flexibility should be given. For the sake of considering both parties, it is permitted for the company to restore the work of some old workers as much as possible within the scope of the current situation. Those who cannot be placed immediately should be sent to the Hangzhou factory by the company for temporary placement to avoid unemployment. If the Hangzhou factory also cannot accommodate all of them due to too many people, the remaining workers should be dismissed in accordance with the procedures and reported to the government for approval." After investigation, the Sanyou Industrial Company's main factory has been operating for 21 years since its establishment in the Republic era (1912), and the annual profits have been considerable. Even in the past year alone, there were as many as 321,887.45 yuan. As for the war losses, it was only a very small number of earthen walls. Moreover, the company's 15th shareholders' meeting decided to allocate 200,000 yuan from the 20th year's profits to prepare for war losses. Furthermore, the total capital of the company is 2 million yuan. According to the existing buildings, land, and machinery, in addition to the total amount of depreciation reserve for machinery generated over the years (324,534.18 yuan), the price depreciation reserve for goods (130,000 yuan), the retained earnings (24,235.35 yuan), the public reserve (174,203.29 yuan), the net profit (121,887.45 yuan), and the 200,000 yuan set aside this year for war losses, it has reached 2,994,534.18 yuan, which is more than one-third above the capital amount. There are also finished goods and outstanding debts, totaling 3,568,803.73 yuan. It is really unknown what the company's claim of huge losses is based on. The Social Affairs Bureau's investigation is not detailed and is unfair. Moreover, the work in the branch factory is still going on as usual. The surplus from the main factory is used to open a branch factory in Hangzhou. Our union's thousand members have worked in the Sanyou Industrial Company's main factory for at least five or six years. The company's dispute arose not before the war, but after the war. Their usual sinister intentions are beyond doubt. Now, the municipal government's 165th instruction approves the dismissal of too many people who cannot be accommodated, which is tantamount to giving the company the convenience of dismissal, with only the procedure missing. Even if we take a step back, if the company is indeed losing money, it should restore the work of old workers within the possible scope. Then, the distinction between new and old workers and the workers in the branch factory are all examples of being dismissed. The workers in the main factory should naturally have the right to resume work with priority. To focus on the minor aspects while neglecting the fundamentals is showing that they do not know their limitations. Alas, the Sanyou Industrial Company, which is known for promoting industry and solving people's livelihoods, still has this unfortunate phenomenon. Then the rest of the factories are even more unimaginable. In short, the company disregards the welfare of society and engages in this despicable behavior of harming others to benefit themselves, which is enough to destroy their lifeline. Our union's thousand members vow to fight for justice until death, and any sacrifice is worth it. We still hope that people from all walks of life will provide fair comments and sympathetic assistance from a just standpoint. Not only is this the union's hope, but it is also the hope of industry and people's livelihoods. This is the declaration of the Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union.</p>

<h3>Scarlet Fever Discovered in Xujiahui</h3>
<p>The weather this summer is irregular, and there are abnormal alternations of cold and heat. Scarlet fever has suddenly been discovered in Xujiahui, Shanghai West.

<h3>Married Woman Xu Wenzhuan Requests Division of Inheritance</h3>
<p>Xu Wenzhuan, a woman from No. 824, West Fahua Market, Song District, hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to sue her brother, Xu Wenrui, for dividing the inheritance as a woman. The original complaint stated that her father only had two daughters and adopted Xu Wenrui as his son in his later years. The father passed away on October 1, 1927 (Republican Year 16). The plaintiff happened to be living in Japan with her husband, and her mother was old and sick at home with paralysis and mental loss. Therefore, the inheritance was all managed by the defendant, Xu Wenrui. The plaintiff repeatedly invited relatives to request a division, but the defendant delayed it in every possible way. She does not engage in production, wastes and spends money, and has been selling the inheritance one after another. In January of this year, he sold three mu and one fen of land in the fifth map of the 28th Bao without authorization, obtaining 16,500 taels of silver. In May of this year, he sold one mu of land in the seventh map of the 28th Bao in Shangyi, obtaining more than 3,000 yuan. According to law, the plaintiff should receive 10,000 yuan of the above price, but he did not give a single penny, bullying the woman and deliberately embezzling the money. However, under his management, there is still one house and three bungalows in the fifth map of the 27th Bao, two bungalows in the fifth map of the 29th Bao, and 25 mu of land. Except for the house, which is reserved for the mother's future funeral expenses, all five rented bungalows should be divided according to law, and the plaintiff should receive two, worth 900 yuan. The plaintiff should receive ten mu of the 25 mu of land, worth 5,000 yuan. In total, the plaintiff alone should receive 15,900 yuan. Therefore, according to Article 1142, Paragraph 1 of the Inheritance Chapter of the Civil Code, the plaintiff sues for a judgment to divide the inheritance. Her husband works in Japan, but he has recently returned to China due to the Japanese excluding overseas Chinese, resulting in a difficult family livelihood. She requests assistance with the litigation costs. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Run opened the court to question the plaintiff about the object of the request. The defendant was not present and also hired a lawyer to appear in court, requesting a postponement. The request was approved and the hearing was scheduled for July 13th in the morning.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of an Unmarried Young Couple</h3>
<p>Hu Cuiying Committed Suicide by Poisoning. Hu Cuiying, a 19-year-old daughter of Hu Youan, a native of Haiyan, Zhejiang Province, who lived at No. 35, Pingjiangli, Lanwei Ai Road, French Concession, had been betrothed to Han Guoqing, a young man from Haimen (same age as the woman) who lived at No. 17 in the same neighborhood. The two young people had matched themselves and were engaged by their parents. Therefore, although they were not married, the young couple's relationship was very strong. The two sides visited each other from time to time. Recently, the woman did not know what had stimulated her, and suddenly had suicidal thoughts. At 6:00 AM yesterday, she swallowed poison in her mother's house. After taking the poison, she was still sleeping in bed. At 7:00 AM, her mother saw that her daughter was still sleeping late and did not get up, so she went to the bed to call her, but she did not respond. When she lifted the curtain to check, she saw that the woman's face had changed drastically and she could not open her mouth. She also saw that the woman's fingers and corners of her lips were stained with raw opium, and she knew that she had taken poison. She immediately hired a car to take her to Renji Hospital. Because she had been deeply poisoned, the treatment was ineffective. At 9:00 AM yesterday, she died in the hospital. The hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to take the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Yanshi Institute to examine the body. At the same time, detectives went to the deceased's home to investigate the circumstances of her suicide by poisoning. The report will be made to the Second Special District Court today to send someone to examine the body.</p>

Ding Rongchang came out to break it up. Later, Jia Songlin also came out upon hearing the noise and accused Ding of protecting his own child and insulting his daughter, leading to a conflict. They then started fighting each other, during which Jia broke Ding's head, causing profuse bleeding. The police arrived and took both of them to the police station. The next day, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case. Then, the plaintiff Ding Rongchang testified about how he was beaten by Jia. When questioned, Jia Songlin claimed that Ding Rongchang had initiated the fight by throwing a glass bottle at him. At that time, Jia used his hand to block it, resulting in an injury to his left arm. He denied initiating the assault. Judge Zhang reviewed the testimony and ordered a postponement for further hearing, ordering Jia to post bail pending further instructions and instructing Ding to be examined by a forensic doctor.</p>

<h3>Basic Principles of Railway Transportation Liability Regulations</h3>
<p>— Zheng Baozhao</p>
<p>(1) Introduction: I have always believed that when railways collect freight charges and transport goods, they should not only base their actions on legal aspects, but also assume corresponding responsibilities within the limits of their own powers, according to the theory of rights and obligations. This is actually necessary for the development of railway business. The relationship between railways and merchants is closely related, and their interests are intertwined. It is not like a horse and cow that have nothing to do with each other. From a superficial perspective, it may seem unfavorable for railways to be responsible for compensating losses and increasing expenses within a reasonable range. However, upon further study, it can be seen that railways assuming reasonable responsibilities can directly reduce the burden on merchants and reduce the occurrence of losses. Indirectly, it can promote the smooth flow of goods and promote the development of transportation. The benefits to both railways and merchants are enormous. Therefore, railways in Europe and the United States have long implemented responsible measures for cargo transportation. Although there are specific regulations detailing the responsible issue, they all strive to fulfill the responsibility of safeguarding goods from the time of acceptance to the time of unloading, and strive to prevent all losses that can be avoided by human power, in order to achieve the greatest safety and the least losses. In any case, within the scope of possible power, they are eager to pay attention to and deal with safekeeping, so that if damage occurs unfortunately, they must be liable for compensation. There is no saying of no responsibility. Therefore, the railway business in their countries is thriving, goods are flowing smoothly, and industry and commerce are developing, is it not appropriate? Looking at the cargo transportation of railways in our country, although there are two regulations for railway responsibility and cargo owner responsibility, and there are general principles for cargo car transportation responsibility promulgated by the Ministry, in fact, only the four Taotao railways outside Guanwai have long been handling responsible transportation. As for the roads inside Guanwai, only the Beijing Ning Railway is currently implementing it, and in other roads, the so-called responsible transportation is mostly as if it does not exist, almost a formality. Occasionally, there are very few, because the railways cannot fulfill the duty of safe custody due to various reasons. Therefore, most merchants, although unwilling to pay more freight, report for transport according to railway responsibility, or would rather be responsible for themselves and report directly, or entrust an intermediary to report indirectly, and the intermediary takes responsibility on their behalf, so that it is difficult for merchants' goods to obtain security, and sales and transport are hindered. All aspects of the distribution of production and consumption, and the progress of industrial and commercial enterprises are affected, and railway transportation is also greatly affected. Recently, the Ministry of Railways has seen this and adopted the European and American responsible transportation system, considering the actual conditions of the roads, stipulating implementation procedures, and has ordered Jinpu Railway to prepare for implementation immediately, and sent special commissioners to guide it. After Jinpu Road is implemented, it will be extended to other roads to achieve consistency. I believe that the implementation of responsible transportation is an important way to promote the cargo transportation of the roads and support industrial and commercial enterprises. There is now a large department in charge at the top, and the roads are actively preparing at the bottom. The smooth progress of this matter in the future and the perfection of the results can be expected soon. We, for the railway industry, for the national economy and people's livelihood, can't help but look forward to it. Now, during the preparatory period for responsible transportation, the matters that should be planned in advance are complex, and the establishment of complete laws and regulations to be followed is particularly important. Yu, in addition to being ordered to prepare, dares to use his spare time to study the basic principles of European and American railway responsible transportation laws and regulations. Here, I will state what I have seen and heard, selecting the essentials for reference materials. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Myriad Women's Hair</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Having suffered the significant stimulation of September 18th and January 28th, cursing the imperialists loudly is ineffective. If cursing could be used as a weapon, then street-cursing women could serve as female vanguards and commanders! Heh! How absurd!</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A loss is a lesson." Seeing that the Japanese suffered losses in street fighting, they are now desperately practicing it; learning from others' strengths to compensate for one's own weaknesses is a common sense that Chinese people should possess.</p>
<p>In the past, the Japanese Yushukan displayed the spoils of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, which filled every patriotic Chinese with rage. The most shameful of all were the many plaques of "virtuous governance" on warships, such as "Virtue extends to the farthest shores" and "The sea embraces with spring nurturing," all of which were tributes from lower-level officials to their superiors. The naval officers and soldiers of that time were so corrupt that it was no wonder that after one battle, the Qing Dynasty's painstakingly built navy became a fleeting flower.</p>
<p>However, there was also a coil of women's hair rope in the Yushukan, about an inch in diameter and a hundred feet long, produced by the Japanese naval department. There was a description on it, which roughly stated: "During the Jiawu War, all the men went to the battlefield, and the women also fulfilled their duties. The people of the Miyazaki Prefecture and Sendai Samurai clan, including a commoner named Nissi Ienao, gathered comrades to cut the hair of ten thousand women and made a long rope to be contributed to the government and transferred to the navy for use in calculating the branches of Chinese warships. The soldiers, seeing the hair of their mothers, wives, and sisters, were all moved to tears and determined to die!"</p>
<p>Alas! Cutting hair has become a widespread trend among Chinese women! In recent years, how many millions of women have cut their hair? It's just a pity, a pity that they haven't contributed it to the navy for anti-Japanese salvation! The hair cutting of the women of that country is driven by patriotism; the hair cutting of the women of our country is driven by modernization; the same hair cutting, but it is a thousand miles away!</p>
<h3>Mongolian's Patriotic Preparations</h3>
<p>— Old Farmer of Tiantou</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from my friend Guo Jingcheng from Manzhouli, stating that the Mongolians there are well aware of the Japanese's treacherous behavior and violent actions. The people of the three northeastern provinces have suffered massacres, and they are all filled with righteous indignation and are trying to resist. Therefore, although the Japanese have lured them in every possible way, they have not succumbed. However, due to their weak strength, they have had to deal with them in a superficial way, inducing them to give them firearms and ammunition, secretly accumulating grass and storing grain, and stepping up training. Once the central government sends troops to suppress them, they will immediately raise their arms in response, so as to achieve a pincer attack. Their careful planning and patriotic enthusiasm are truly admirable. I have hastily extracted and recorded them on the left.</p>
<p>Heavy Gifts and Sweet Words The Mongolians have been a military powerhouse dominating Europe and Asia since Genghis Khan's time. Their fierce style is well known. Although they have declined slightly in recent years, they still value martial prowess and excel at riding and archery. Therefore, since the Japanese invaded Liaoning and Jilin, they have been wary of their ferocity and have sent envoys to persuade them, giving them weapons and food, and trying to win them over in many ways, hoping to use them. However, the princes and Beile of each banner are deeply aware of righteousness. On the surface, they pretended to cooperate and induced them to give them ammunition to supplement their strength. In fact, they still supported the central government and did not succumb. Seeing that their plan had failed, the Japanese had lost their weapons and food in vain. Therefore, they instructed the puppet state to give the Mongolians extra preferential treatment. All the newly issued exorbitant taxes and heavy taxes were waived to show their goodwill. They also had the puppet state authorities collude with the Mongol banner princes, promising them heavy profits, inciting them to break away from the central government and cooperate with them. The matter was unsuccessful again. The Japanese then knew that the Mongolians would never be used by them. They were slightly more wary of them, but they did not dare to turn against them immediately, adding another strong enemy. This is the current situation of both sides.</p>
<p>Feeding the Horses and Sharpening the Weapons After the Mongolians induced the Japanese army to give them a large number of weapons and ammunition, they secretly ordered their subordinates to accumulate grass and store grain in advance. On one hand, they also selected elite soldiers and stepped up training. Men over the age of fifteen and under the age of forty were required to enlist in the army for training. Women were assigned to transportation and other tasks, each doing their job in an orderly manner. There was a great momentum of feeding the horses and sharpening the weapons, ready to strike at any moment. However, because the Japanese had sharp weapons, they did not dare to revolt rashly. They were deeply afraid that once the war started, their strength would not be enough, and there would be no support, and they would inevitably be trapped in a desperate situation and annihilated. Therefore, they are currently focused on appeasing their subordinates, inspiring morale, and waiting for the central government to send troops to suppress them. They will immediately respond. Alas, the Mongolians are so loyal. What strategy will our ruling authorities use to recover the three northeastern provinces and rescue the people from fire and water?</p>
<h3>World Mini-News</h3>

<p>The world's longest will is probably the one made by Mrs. Florence Cooke of London. She started writing it at the age of twenty and continued until she died of illness at the age of forty. Everything she owned in her life was recorded in great detail, filling eight large volumes. And all of her property was worth only five thousand pounds.</p>
<p>During the reign of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, his arrogance was at its peak and he was invincible. The horn on his royal chariot played a rhythmic tune, "Tai, Di, Tai, Tai". As soon as the townspeople heard this sound, they knew the emperor was coming and quickly stood in silence and avoided him. Wilhelm thought that the horn tune was his own invention. In fact, the tune played by Jewish people with ram's horns on "Repentance Day" is the same.</p>
<p>The British Aviation Headquarters has announced to all public and private aircraft nationwide that they must fly very high when passing over the Whipsuade Zoo, because the animals in the zoo tend to run wild when they hear the sound of the engine.</p>
<h3>Portrait Hidden in Ashes of Robbery</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Since Jiading was established as a county, it has been known for its outstanding human culture. However, at the time of the dynastic change, it was like a half-pond that was abandoned, but its water had not dried up. The remnant stones of Xilin were still fresh with blood. It often makes people sigh and admire. Although it is as distant as the Han and Wei dynasties, respecting one's hometown cannot be stopped. The sage Cheng Chizheng, during the Gengxu year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, feared that human cultural relics would turn into clouds and smoke. Therefore, he took it upon himself to commend them, painting six volumes of portraits of famous people from Lianchuan. Three volumes were continued. By the Jiazi year of the Tongzhi reign, it suffered from war again. The uncarved images were also lost and not passed down. Later, in the early years of the Guangxu reign, Zhang Xiufu of Chanan, in Yongzhou, discussed it with Wang Wenqin of Renhe and collected funds to reprint it. However, they were unable to collect and search for them, and many of the missing and lost ones were obscured and unclear, and many were buried in the ground.</p>
<p>Last spring, Zhang Hongnian and Gu Jichang in the county feared the loss of the model of the seniors. They initiated the reprinting of three hundred copies and personally took on half of the printing costs. The rest were promoted by comrades who were interested in it. Thus, the book was able to be seen again in the world. The edition was first stored in Xiangzhong. In the early years of the Republic of China, it returned to the Langcun family of the Cheng clan. Later, it was purchased with public funds and returned to public ownership. It was stored in the Cunrentang to show its solemnity. After twenty years, it was undamaged. However, when reprinting, the original edition was checked. The first page of the third volume was missing. It was a portrait of General Qian, whose name was Shi Zhen, whose style name was Shisun, and whose alias was Sanchi. He was a martial arts scholar in the Yichou year of the Wanli reign. He served as the general commander of Jiliao town and the town comfort envoy of the Suzhou Guard. In the picture, he wears a general's crown, armor, holds a cone, and wears a cloak. However, the folds were difficult to draw. The original book was sought and entrusted to Mr. Gu Jingzai in Shanghai to supplement and reprint it, so it was finally perfected. And the matter was just concluded.</p>
<p>What is different is that when Mr. Qian was in the Ming Dynasty, Korea was invaded by the Japanese. The court decided to send troops to the east. Song Yingchang, the manager, added the title of guerrilla general to Shu, subordinate to the vanguard. He crossed the Yalu River twice as fast as usual to Pyongyang. General Li Rusong promised to reward ten thousand gold to the first one to ascend and reward the hereditary commander. Mr. Qian led seven hundred cavalry to conquer it. Then he went north across the Datong River and beheaded a brave Japanese general before returning. The one in charge asked about his name, but there was no answer, so his credit was ignored. Therefore, a military song was written, "The camp only follows the flag drum. Why bother asking the name when you meet the blade?" His generous indignation can be seen in his words. Unexpectedly, this time Cunrentang was destroyed by the Japanese army again. The pear and jujube wood was all turned into ashes. And the edition of the reprinted Mr. Qian was just one year old, and it could not be found in the ruins again. Could it be that the robbery number has been predetermined?</p>
<h3>Pitiable Face</h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>"Wanting face" what does this phrase mean? Most women "want face" the most. When they go out to meet guests, they must wear beautiful clothes, and if that's not enough, they add some jewelry, the more valuable the better. Women call these unnecessary vanities "wanting face." In a certain sense, "wanting face" can even be considered a virtue.</p>
<p>Many "Misses" and "Mrs."们, in order to like the so-called "face", do not hesitate to "sacrifice capital", hold a great personality bargain, to exchange for money, and then use money to buy "face". Many of them have sold their bodies and spirits for this. Their lifelong happiness has also been sold. What a pitiful "face"!</p>
<p>I once read the novel "The Necklace" by the world's great writer Maupassant, which describes the wife of a Ministry of Education secretary, who tasted the bitterness of life because of a night of "face". When the dream of Huang Liang woke up, she suddenly realized that what she had done that night was still a "fake face." The story of this novel is really moving, especially its ending, which uses a comedic scene to convey the deep meaning of infinite sorrow. After all, it is a masterpiece of a great writer, and reading it makes people feel a different kind of emotion!</p>
<p>Recently, Tianyi Film Company has adapted "The Necklace" into a script and brought it to the screen, turning it into "One Night of Luxury". On the screen, the form of the story has changed a lot, and it seems that the spirit has also been further conveyed. "One Night of Luxury" not only criticizes the undesirability of "face", but also points out the cause of why women "want face".</p>
<p>"Wanting face", why want this boring "face"? "One Night of Luxury" bravely fired three cannons at women who "want face", and also swept a burst at the society of gentlemen who "want face". This film is certainly not as fashionable as a triangular love film, but it is a medicine for the modern disease of women. Medicine is certainly not as delicious as chocolate, but it will cure your disease immediately.</p>
<p>Girls, wives, you all go and see "One Night of Luxury"! I sincerely introduce it to you, and you will definitely get a great reward!</p>
<h3>The History of the Development of Female Aviators (II)</h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>Let us not be convinced by what Rousseau said, that is, that men are strong and active, and women are weak and passive, so women and men cannot be equal in ability after all. In other words, whether in physiological function or mental activity, women are invariably inferior to men. However, this view, if examined from the history of primitive human life, has already been refuted by many sociologists, so it seems unnecessary for me to say more; just by looking briefly at the modern sports world, the labor world, and the aviation world, sometimes those brave women are often able to surpass the abilities of men. Therefore, I believe that in the future, as long as women can be liberated to stand completely on the same level as men, then there is no reason why women cannot do everything that men can do.</p>
<p>Even looking at the bold behavior and adventurous spirit of women as aviators, one cannot confirm that they are weak after all, and one cannot deny that they have this special talent. A teacher at a certain aviation school once said that the skills of female students are often better than those of male students. According to reports, recently there was an American woman of twenty-four years old who understood everything necessary about engines and balloons within twenty-five minutes; and after only six hours of practical guidance, she was able to fly into the sky on her own.</p>
<p>In this way, it is not surprising that Miss Helen Madison of Seattle, USA, who will participate in this 10th World Alimbeck Games, at the young age of only eighteen, has already created sixteen world records in the swimming world, thus winning the title of the first extraordinary woman in the world of swimming, and it is said that she surpasses male athletes in all sports. In addition, Ms. Lunhai Hurs is also a famous figure in the world of tennis. Thus, the saying that women's abilities are inherently not as strong as men's is probably gradually becoming untenable in the face of this new era.</p>
<h3>A Record of Dual Life in the Military and Civilian Worlds (99)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Investigating the Previous Magistrate's Publicly Posted Prices; Planning Jointly to Build Private Residences, Each with Considerations for Human Sentiment. Lord Wu was delighted to hear this. He immediately forgot that Master Wu was still a Han Chinese. On the contrary, he regarded him as his only confidant. He introduced him to An and Hu. He immediately invited everyone to go to the county government office to handle affairs. Although An Yutian should not have been involved in the investigation of the case, he cooperated with Hu Shide. Therefore, he treated others' affairs as his own. It was reasonable to go with him to support Hu Shide and show his power. Moreover, he also knew that Li Pinzhai was Li Wenxia's father. This old man was stubborn and ungrateful and had always aroused his hatred. Therefore, he was very willing to help Hu Shide deal with this old thing. At that time, he led the entire team and strode into the empty county government office with great prestige. The yamen runners of the three shifts and six departments had already stood in line outside the yamen gate to greet him. However, the sight of the yamen was very miserable and desolate. The screen wall outside the gate was peeling off, revealing many bricks and stones. The two memorial arches at the east and west yamen gates were dilapidated and tilted, about to collapse. A pair of stone lions with broken heads and limbs had also suffered from many years of disability. All the way from the gate into the ceremonial gate and up to the main hall, what was stepped on was a damp and filthy road, and what was seen was a gray and withered house. The doors were decaying and the households were declining. Even the roof tiles were covered with messy reeds that were several feet long. Saying it was an ancient temple in the deep mountains was somewhat like it. Saying it was the government office of a county, it was so poor that it was no wonder that the corrupt officials all wanted to be starving ghosts. From the main hall, they turned to the signing room behind. Several local gentry had already come and were waiting here. Wu Jinlu originally recognized them, so he introduced their names one by one and sat down together to open a temporary meeting. These people were the best at beating a dead tiger. Naturally, they all spoke in unison and complained about the misdeeds of the previous Li Pinzhai. An old gentleman pointed to the wall and said with a smile, "That Lord Li is really audacious and disregards the law. He wants money more than he wants his life. Since taking office, he has not asked about right and wrong in civil and criminal lawsuits, only caring about who is willing to send money and who sends more money. He openly bargains with the people who file lawsuits. If you don't believe me, here is the price list he personally ordered. It is grandly pasted on the wall." An Yutian was surprised to hear this. He quickly stood up and walked over to take a closer look. He saw half a sheet of tiger skin paper, pasted like a horizontal plaque. Lines of small regular script were written on it. The writing style was similar to the Wei stele, extremely elegant and powerful. At first glance, it almost looked like a calligraphy work by a famous person.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Saving the Nation with Sutras and Mantras</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the call to save the nation has been very high. Some say save the nation with sparrows, some say save the nation with dancing, some say save the nation with romance, but these are mostly humorous and satirical arguments. Now, saving the nation with sutras and mantras is the true meaning and orthodox transmission of a national salvation scripture.</p>
<p>According to the World News Agency yesterday, Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian and Li Jishen, as well as non-governmental celebrities such as Sun Hongyi, have initiated the construction of a Secret Sect Golden Light Altar in Yonghe Temple in Beijing to pray for the cessation of disasters and disturbances and the transformation of calamities. Because the country is in great difficulty and disasters are frequent, they have no way and want to use Buddhism to universally save all living beings. This can be considered extremely boring.</p>
<p>The general idea of the fundraising notice is that the rule of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty was attributed to the secret sect master Shan Nianwei, and the strength of Japan was attributed to the fact that Kobo Daishi studied under Huiguo, a disciple of Amoghavajra. If Buddhism is truly boundless and can save the country, then why did India, which produced Buddhism, perish at the hands of the three islands of Britain first? I absolutely dare not deeply believe in this statement.</p>
<p>However, governing a country has great laws and constant principles. The ancients said, "The world is for all, and the virtuous are selected to be able." Whether in China or abroad, ancient or modern, one cannot escape this common rule. If the world is regarded as one's own property, relatives are regarded as one's confidants, there are only personal opinions, and no other people's opinions are allowed, there are only personal rights, and no other people's rights are allowed, this kind of family world governance has become a thing of the past, and no one can help to manage it.</p>
<p>For example, a patient is at the point where all doctors are helpless and about to die. The family has no idea what to do, so they think of a way to get rid of external evils. They are afraid that "Five Monsters," "Teng Snake," and "Old Master Zhou who fell into the water" are causing trouble, so they call a few Taoist priests to perform rituals. But this disease is a real disease after all, and has nothing to do with external evils. It is still best to ask a few capable doctors to take a look.</p>

<h3>Feeling After the Enemy Retreats, Using Mengtiao's Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Feng Meizhou</p>
<p>The city was forced to form an alliance to stop the war, in vain letting hot blood stain the mountains and rivers. White bones add new graves in the suburbs, and a loyal heart in hundreds of battles is left to the passing waves. I gradually feel that the beacon smoke is far from Liaohai, and the flowers and moon are still plentiful on the Shanghai River. The court boasts of peace-making strategies, but how can the national power be as tight as the day!</p>

<p>The soul of Emperor Wang disappeared into the desolate dust, and the jade trees in the backyard were all fluttering. In the third watch, birds cry on the branches under the moon, and half of the makeup is incomplete, with a phoenix facing the morning. The azalea does not refuse the road outside the mountain, and who sends the lonely spirit to the head of spring. The pure heart mistakenly guesses that it contains the morning sun, and the blood and tears recognize that the spots are not true.</p>

<h3>Method of Making Blueprint Paper</h3>
<p>— Ercheng</p>
<p>The use of blueprint paper: Blueprint paper is a kind of paper coated with medicine liquid. When it sees strong light, the medicine liquid on the paper first turns red, then turns blue, and then it is deeply printed on it. Even if it is washed in water, it will not fade. However, blueprint paper that has not been exposed to sunlight will completely wash away the light green medicine liquid when it encounters water. We use this effect to print drawings and print photos. Therefore, the engineering drawings of various engineering bureaus are now printed with blueprint paper. However, this paper is all foreign goods. Although China has imitations, they are not popular and are not used in large quantities. It is cheaper to make it yourself when the amount is small. Therefore, I will write down the method of making it for the research and improvement of those who share my interests.</p>
<p>Raw materials: Ferriaminonium Cttrate, 9 qian; Potassium Ferricyanid, 8 qian; saturated oxalic acid solution (dissolve oxalic acid in water until it cannot be dissolved), 5 qian; ammonia, 5 fen; clear water, 6 liang.</p>
<p>Production method: After the above medicines are prepared, dissolve the light iron of the lemon in three rains of clear water, and then dissolve the red blood salt in three liang of clear water, and then mix with the above-mentioned amount of saturated oxalic acid solution and ammonia (according to Yu's test, oxalic acid solution and ammonia can be used without adding). Store them separately in yellow bottles. When using, mix the two bottles of liquid equally in the dark. Dip a soft toothbrush or gauze in the liquid and apply it on white and smooth paper (such as Daolin paper). Place it in a dark place to dry in the shade. Do not expose it to light and it will be ready. As for the blueprinting procedure, put the transparent glass paper with the drawing or the photographic negative with the object shadow into the frame. In the dark room, put the side of the blueprint paper coated with medicine close to it, and expose it to sunlight. When it changes color, you can take it off and wash it with clear water and cool it to dry. The image is completely visible and very clear.</p>

<h3>Madman's Words</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>(I) They all say I am a madman, okay, I will admit it. But why don't they realize that they are more mad than I am? Their day and night conspiracies, slanders, curses, massacres::: aren't these crazy enough?</p>
<p>Ah! People will know to do their best to defend themselves, especially those vampires!</p>
<p>(II) Yesterday I saw a thin beggar catching insects with extreme hatred, of course, because lice were sucking his blood. However, is it just lice that sucked him so thin? He wouldn't know that. I know, I understand that reason, but I don't know how to tell him.</p>

<p>Luxurious cars gallop on the road, leaving many residual oil stains. In my eyes, they are all scarlet blood, scarlet blood!</p>

<p>Because the cleaner wore a vest in the color of the national flag, cars, trams, carriages, high heels, walking sticks::: no one dared to touch him. Ah! Great national flag color.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>A small ant was probably living too angrily. It bit Guo Butcher's palm forcefully. Of course, he killed it without caring. This was just a life game for him.</p>

<p>Alas!</p>
<h3>"Royal Army" and "Chinese"</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Dragging my heavy footsteps, I returned from a very tiring job late one night. When I reached the intersection of Hart Road, I saw a dark group of people in the distance and heard a burst of noisy sounds. A curious mentality immediately dragged my feet forward.</p>
<p>When I walked into that dark crowd, the first thing that jumped into my eyes was blood all over the ground. Three drunken royal sailors were beating a person. Of course, this person was a compatriot of our Great Republic of China—no, a slave of a semi-colony, a subjugated slave under the joint rule of imperialist powers—</p>
<p>The iron hooves of the strong are trampling on the backs of the weak. Six huge fists are beating the face, back, and any part of the weak. Blood gushes from the corners of the mouth and from the head of the weak, flowing on the ground, scarlet—this is the blood of the weak, the tragic blood, and also the blood of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>All around there were roars of anger, "Hit:: Hit"! Whoever roars! Whoever roars will be hit, six fists waving around, and people retreat like a tide.</p>
<p>At that time, the weak in the pool of blood had struggled to get up and planned to go to the so-called XXX who maintains law and order, maintains order, and maintains justice to file a lawsuit of justice. However, this is also not allowed by the strong. "The strong eat the weak" is justice, is justice. You are a slave of the colony. It is right to be beaten! Are you not convinced? Beat you a second time, so six huge fists and six iron hooves beat the face and back of the weak again.</p>
<p>"Aiyo"! This is the groan of the weak, this groan pierced my heart.</p>
<p>All around there was another roar of "Hit:: Hit," and anger was burning in everyone's heart, and sorrow and indignation were stirring in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>At this time, the fire of sorrow and indignation burned so much that I trembled all over, and sparks flew before my eyes. I could only gnash my teeth and curse these beasts!</p>
<p>Finally, the strong lightly whistled a song of triumph and left, and the weak also dragged their sorrowful groans away, and the crowd also sighed a tragic breath and dispersed. On the dead silent road, there was only me left, and a pile of scarlet blood!</p>
<p>Looking at the blood, I got enlightenment. This enlightenment is tooth for tooth, eye for eye, blood debt, and must be washed clean with blood.</p>
<p>But I believe that in this scarlet pool of blood, in this roar all around, history has already dug a grave door for you. You brutal beasts, you oppressors, one billion two hundred and fifty million oppressed slaves will one day ring your death knell.</p>
<p>This tragic struggle has further increased my belief, given me motivation, and with great excitement, I also bid farewell to that pile of blood and returned, stepping on the frost-like moonlight.</p>
<p>Reason</p>
<h3>What Harm Is There in Doing It?</h3>
<p>— Yan Xing</p>
<p>I met my friend Mr. Wang, whom I hadn't seen for a long time, at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shilu last night. He was wearing a snow-white curled-brimmed straw hat, a brand-new silk gauze long gown, and silk shoes and socks. At a glance, I knew that he was very proud now.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yan, long time no see, how are you!" After he saw me, he called out to me first.</p>
<p>"Are you Wang XX? If you hadn't called out to me, I almost wouldn't have recognized you. What have you been doing lately? Are you doing well?" I stood still and asked him like this.</p>
<p>"I'm working as a runner in XX Foreign Company now. Doing well is neither here nor there," he replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"Yo!" I said in surprise, "Isn't XX Foreign Company opened by XX people? Everyone is boycotting XX goods now, but you are helping them promote them. Aren't you a traitor?"</p>
<p>"Who wants to! The environment is forcing me!" He lowered his head and sighed softly, saying, "Last year I worked as a clerk in XX Industrial Society, and I got fifteen old ocean dollars a month. I had to work eleven hours a day, and if I made a mistake, I had to pay compensation. So, when I picked up my wages, it was never certain that they would be discounted by 70% or 80%. These things don't matter, because I can barely make a living. Unexpectedly, the January 28th Incident suddenly broke out. At that time, everyone was panicking and fleeing to the interior. Our manager also felt that he could not bear the burden of everyone's lives, so he told us — the junior staff — to go home. So I also returned to my hometown — Jiaxing — to take temporary refuge. After the incident subsided, I came out, but the company used the excuse that the business was depressed after the war and implemented austerity without hiring. I had no choice but to rent a hotel and ask friends and relatives to help me find a job. After waiting for more than two months, I almost ate and pawned everything. Finally, I found this job. If I didn't do it again, wouldn't I have to starve to death? At that time, when I met relatives and friends, don't say that they would open their purses to help, I'm afraid they wouldn't even bother to talk to me — even the National Government wouldn't give me a special reward because I was a loyal person!"</p>
<p>"Then is business good?" I asked him again.</p>
<p>"Taking 60-count yarn as an example, Western goods now sell for 400 taels of silver per piece; XX goods are much cheaper than that. Our countrymen are the most greedy for cheap things, so how can business not be good? And the goods are shipped by XX Insurance, and no one dares to touch them on the road. As for me, in addition to my monthly salary of 30 taels of silver, if I sell a piece of yarn, I get a commission of 20 taels of silver, so what harm is there in doing it?"</p>
<p>"What harm is there in doing it?" "What harm is there in doing it?" After I parted with him, I thought repeatedly, the so-called profiteers only care about being greedy for cheap things and only care about making money. Their national concept is very weak, and this one point can summarize the rest!</p>
