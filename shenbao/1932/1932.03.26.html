<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">告今日從事政治運動者㈡彬· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>關於舊軍閥官僚政客之企圖。乘機捲土重來。而積極從事於所謂政治運動。昨評所言。猶有未盡。茲請更進一步之說明。</p>
<p>彼舊軍閥官僚政客之所以積極從事政治運動者。其意不謂國民黨主政六年。而國勢乃每况愈下以今例昔。彼輩尙未遂斷絕其政治生命乎。吾人固不願絕其自新之路。但今日之時代。已非前日之時代。政治但當推進入新的軌道。絕不容開倒退之車。彼輩今日之主張則未見較現政府有若何之進步。是則彼輩之活動。不過爲個人之利益耳。即使其能重登政治舞台。而謂其遂能奠定我國家拯救我人民其誰信之。</p>
<p>在此時期。更有一般赤心誠意之國民。怵於國亡之無日。旦夕惶惶。奔走追呼。無以自主。吾人亦不能無一言。</p>
<p>吾人認爲國危民困至於今日之情勢。稍有血氣之倫。皆當以救國救民族爲前提。執政之國民黨。固應虛懐悔禍。毋再固執成見。即暫時不能遽然還政於民。但最小限度亦應自動公開政治。而一般赤心誠意救國之人士。其苦心孤詣。奔走追呼。積極活動。欲以改善政治。固最足欽佩。但欲使力不枉費。心不徒勞。則此處亦有急待解答之先决問題在。</p>
<p>㈠假如國民黨此時而果眞還政於民熱心救國之個人。或主張不同之若干人。果能立即鳥合。以共負國家之大政否。如其不能。則從可知任何有辦法有血氣有毅力之個人。皆無力以挽救當前之難局。必須有嚴密之組織。而此組織。又非以個人爲中心共同奮鬥。乃能有成。</p>
<p>㈡旣有組織矣但此組織如無偉大之生命。則仍無力以爲國也偉大生命者何。即主義是。中山先生手定之三民主義。吾人未敢認其爲不合於我人民之需要。徒以國民黨底定全國。軍閥政治與官僚政治復興。致主義未得實行。是則今日豈尙有較三民主義更適當之主義乎。吾人認爲今日而言挽救民族。必審目前之病徵與病因。以確立具體之方案。不可偏重理想。不可違背時代之潮流。更不容違反民族與大衆之利益。如無主義以爲組織之生命。則組織將毫無所用。此又吾人所不得不認淸者也。</p>
<p>㈢有主義矣。有組織矣。然而我組織中有若德之白魯寗。意之莫索里尼。蘇聨之史逹林之領袖人材乎。有能共信互信之健全幹部乎。有能難苦奮鬥抱犧牲决心之黨員乎。如其無之則吾人之組織。仍爲徒然。吾人之目的。仍無由而逹到。</p>
<p>凡此問題。吾人皆須先有審愼之思考。以談政治則易。以言組織政黨由難。以言創造爲民族爲大衆而奮鬥之政黨則更難。民國以來之共和黨憲政黨及安福系交通系。今日安在耶。若以爲三人集。合即可組黨。即可狂言改造政治。奠定國基。是殆爲自欺欺人。爲鳥托邦之幻夢。吾見其愚狂矣。未見其可也。國民黨亦有其爲民族奮鬥如黃花崗役之光榮歷史。彼惶惶奔走之諸君子。曷其三思之。</p>

<h3 id="e1">An Admonition to Today's Political Activists (II) – Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the attempts of former warlords, officials, and politicians to seize opportunities and stage a comeback by actively engaging in so-called political movements, what was said in yesterday's commentary remains incomplete. I now offer a more in-depth explanation.</p>
<p>The reason these former warlords, officials, and politicians are actively engaging in political movements is because they believe that after six years of Nationalist Party rule, the country's situation has only worsened. Using the past as an example, have these people not completely severed their political lives? We certainly do not wish to cut off their path to reform, but today's era is not the same as yesterday's. Politics should only advance onto new tracks and must never allow for regression. The proposals of these individuals today show no progress compared to the current government. Therefore, their activities are merely for personal gain. Even if they could return to the political stage, who would believe that they could establish a foundation for our nation and save our people?</p>
<p>During this period, there are also sincere and earnest citizens who, alarmed by the imminent demise of the nation, are anxious day and night, running around calling for help, unable to control themselves. We cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>We believe that the nation's peril and the people's suffering have reached today's state, and anyone with a sense of patriotism should prioritize saving the nation and the people. The ruling Nationalist Party should sincerely regret its mistakes and not stubbornly cling to preconceived notions. Even if it cannot immediately return power to the people, it should, at the very least, voluntarily make its politics transparent. The sincere and earnest people who are dedicated to saving the nation, who painstakingly exert themselves, running around calling for help, and actively working to improve politics, are truly admirable. However, to ensure that their efforts are not wasted and their hearts do not labor in vain, there are urgent and essential preliminary questions that need to be answered here.</p>
<p>(1) If the Nationalist Party were to genuinely return power to the people at this time, could patriotic individuals or groups with differing opinions immediately unite to jointly bear the burden of national governance? If not, then it can be understood that any capable, passionate, and determined individual is powerless to salvage the current crisis. A strict organization is necessary, and this organization can only succeed if it is not centered on individuals but rather on collective struggle.</p>
<p>(2) Even with an organization, if that organization lacks a great life force, it will still be powerless to serve the nation. What is this great life force? It is the doctrine. The Three Principles of the People, personally established by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we dare not say are unsuited to the needs of our people. It is merely that after the Nationalist Party unified the country, warlord politics and bureaucratic politics revived, preventing the doctrine from being implemented. Therefore, is there a more appropriate doctrine today than the Three Principles of the People? We believe that to save the nation today, we must carefully examine the current symptoms and causes of the disease to establish concrete solutions. We must not overemphasize ideals, go against the trends of the times, or violate the interests of the nation and the masses. If there is no doctrine to serve as the life force of the organization, then the organization will be useless. This is another point that we must recognize clearly.</p>
<p>(3) Even with a doctrine and an organization, do our organizations have leaders like Germany's Bismarck, Italy's Mussolini, or the Soviet Union's Stalin? Do we have sound cadres who can trust each other? Do we have party members who can struggle through hardship and have the determination to sacrifice? If not, then our organizations will still be in vain. Our goals will still be unattainable.</p>
<p>We must carefully consider all these questions. It is easy to talk about politics, but difficult to organize a political party. It is even more difficult to create a political party that strives for the nation and the masses. Where are the Republican Party, the Constitutional Party, and the Anfu Clique's Communications Clique from the Republic of China era today? If one thinks that gathering three people is enough to form a party and that one can then make wild claims of reforming politics and establishing the nation's foundation, this is merely deceiving oneself and indulging in a utopian fantasy. We see their foolishness and madness, but we do not see their potential for success. The Nationalist Party also has a glorious history of striving for the nation, such as the Huanghuagang Uprising. Let those gentlemen who are anxiously running around give it some serious thought.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ceasefire Conference Nearly Breaks Down <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's two meetings discussed the troop withdrawal procedures. The Japanese side insisted on withdrawing to the Zhenru-Shizi Lin line. Our representatives firmly opposed and prepared to withdraw. Allied envoys intervened. The meeting will continue this morning. The formal ceasefire conference, attended by representatives from China, Japan, and relevant countries, was held twice yesterday at the British Consulate General to discuss the most crucial Article 2 of the draft ceasefire agreement regarding the Japanese troop withdrawal procedures. The Japanese side insisted on withdrawing to the Zhenru-Shizi Lin line. The Chinese side firmly opposed and expressed its intention to withdraw. After persuasion from allied envoys, it was decided to continue the meeting at 10 a.m. this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Same Representatives Attending <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's meeting was held twice. The first session was from 10:00 a.m. to 12:50 p.m., and the second session was from 3:00 p.m. to 6:50 p.m. The Chinese side was represented by Chief Representative Guo Taiqi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Military Representative Dai Ji, Garrison Commander of Songhu; and Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army. The Japanese side was represented by Chief Representative Uetda Kenkichi, Commander of the 9th Division; Chief of Staff of the Army, Tashiro Kanichirō; and Chief of Staff of the Navy, Shimada Shigetarō. The allied countries were represented by British Minister Lampson; American Minister Johnson; Italian Chargé d'affaires Ciano; and French Minister Wilden, still represented by Bodard, Counselor of the French Embassy. Chinese and Japanese interpreters and attendants were also present, with the seating arrangement remaining the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Tense Atmosphere at the Meeting <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>During this Easter holiday, Westerners are on vacation. However, the allied envoys unanimously attended yesterday's ceasefire negotiations and actively participated, which is evident. The preamble and Article 1 of the ceasefire draft agreement, regarding the temporary stationing of our troops on the current defense line, were decided at the previous day's meeting. Yesterday's meeting proceeded to discuss Article 2 regarding the Japanese troop withdrawal procedures. The announcement from the meeting was quite simple. This reporter, after much probing from various diplomatic circles last night, learned that during yesterday's discussion of Article 2 of the ceasefire draft agreement, "Due to the large number of Japanese troops, a portion may be temporarily stationed in the Public Concession and areas adjacent to roads built by the concession beyond the Hongkou area," the Japanese Chief Representative Ueda stood up and stated that the Japanese troops should withdraw to a defense line from Shizi Lin via Yanghang and Dachang in the east to Zhenru in the west. The Chinese representatives believed that this proposal was vastly different from the principles of Japanese troop withdrawal agreed upon by representatives of both sides at the last preparatory meeting on March 21st, and the text and spirit of the League of Nations Council's resolution of March 4th. Therefore, the Chinese representatives immediately expressed their intention to withdraw from the meeting. The atmosphere in the meeting suddenly became tense. Subsequently, after strenuous persuasion from allied envoys such as Britain and the United States, and the Japanese representatives, knowing that their argument was unreasonable, also expressed that they would reconsider. It was then decided that the meeting would resume at 10 a.m. this morning. American Minister Johnson, who initially planned to accompany his wife to Hangzhou for a spring outing with the League of Nations Inquiry Commission this morning, also canceled his plans.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Reuters Correction Telegram <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Reuters' March 25th correction telegram states: The previous Geneva dispatch reported that during the League of Nations Council meeting on March 16th, Chairman Hymans read the original Chinese telegram, which stated that three measures were drafted at a tea party hosted by British Minister Lampson, the second of which was that Japanese troops would retreat into the Public Concession and out of the roads outside the Hongkou area concession, but because of the large number of Japanese troops, a portion could be temporarily stationed in areas adjacent to the aforementioned locations. Now, this agency has received a verified telegram from Geneva stating that the clause should read: "Japanese troops will retreat to the Public Concession and the roads outside the Hongkou area concession, but because of the large number of Japanese troops, a portion may be temporarily stationed in areas adjacent to the aforementioned area." This correction is made for clarity.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Focus of This Morning's Meeting <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>During the two meetings yesterday morning and afternoon, the Chinese military representative Huang Qiang and the Japanese military representative Tashiro left the meeting room several times to review maps in a separate room. For the sake of ending the matter peacefully and promoting peace, our troops agreed to temporarily station themselves on the current defense line, but the Japanese troops must also completely withdraw to their original positions before January 28th according to a certain procedure. The Japanese side had long advocated withdrawing to the area east of Wusong and the Songhu Road, but it had not been formally proposed until yesterday, when this demand was officially made, and it was even escalated to insist on withdrawing to the line of Zhenru, Dachang, Yanghang, and Shizi Lin. According to those familiar with Japanese-style diplomacy, the true intention of Japan is nothing more than to acquire the area east of Songhu Road as a Japanese troop withdrawal area, as leverage for future round-table conferences. The current insistence on withdrawing to the Zhenru-Shizi Lin line may be a probing tactic, combined with bargaining. Whether or not this morning's meeting can avoid a breakdown depends on this.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Announcement from Last Night's Meeting <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>After last night's meeting, both sides issued a simple statement saying that the meeting had made progress on discussing minor points and that they were now discussing the fundamental points and were trying their best to break through the difficulties, and that the meeting would continue tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Guo Taiqi's Statement <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Our Chief Representative Vice Minister Guo issued a statement yesterday, saying that since the start of the ceasefire negotiations, he has repeatedly and clearly stated that the scope of these negotiations is limited to a practical ceasefire between China and Japan and the withdrawal of Japanese troops, and does not involve any political issues. The ceasefire conference and the peace conference are different in nature. The former belongs to military affairs, and the latter belongs to politics. Before the Japanese troops withdraw, we cannot negotiate any political issues under the threat of their military force. Therefore, initially (on the 6th of this month), when he accepted the invitation to a tea party by the British Minister and met with Minister Shigemitsu at the British Consulate to informally exchange opinions, the latter mentioned the issue of Mayor Wu's reply on January 28th. He immediately stated that this was a political issue and firmly stated that it could not be discussed, and telegraphed Representative Yan in Geneva, requesting him to report this intention to the League of Nations. Subsequently, the Special Committee of the League of Nations Council, based on Representative Yan's report, clarified the nature of the Shanghai ceasefire conference, stating that political conditions could not be discussed. Our current ceasefire conference has consistently been based on the League of Nations' repeated resolutions, with the scope limited to military affairs and not discussing issues of a political nature. We have held this purpose and have not dared to change it. However, there have been many speculations from outside, and some have even adopted the propaganda materials from the Japanese side as the basis for their conjectures, and others have described the details of the meetings as secret diplomacy because the details of the talks have not been disclosed. However, it is not known that the outline of the meeting has been announced and the scope has been determined, so why be surprised and suspicious? Moreover, the situation of the meetings in recent days has been announced as much as possible, and even those who have come to visit have been told the truth. Furthermore, there is more than one representative participating in this meeting, so there is no secret to be kept. It is hoped that the public will dispel their doubts and provide support for diplomacy. The future of the conference is deeply dependent. This time, I have reluctantly accepted the order of the government officials to come to the forefront of the Shanghai Incident, truly because the national crisis is at hand, and public duty and personal friendship cannot be refused. There is absolutely no concept of power and position involved, and there is no power and position to speak of. Moreover, since entering politics, it has been twenty years, and I have always held the principle of staying if we agree and leaving if we disagree. I have never deigned to work for warlord bureaucratic governments. I have followed the late Premier in his efforts in revolutionary diplomacy for more than ten years. I have always admired him deeply and have been influenced by his teachings. I dare to guarantee with my personality that I will never do anything that would betray the country and humiliate the nation. The people can rest assured.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Departs for Nanjing This Morning <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>British and Italian representatives travel to the capital by the Dehe Wheel. American, French and German representatives travel by car to Hangzhou for sightseeing. Received representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and labor unions, etc., yesterday morning. Since arriving in Shanghai, the League of Nations Inquiry Commission has been well received by our side. After starting its investigation work, it visited the war zone on the 21st, and subsequently met with representatives from various sectors for several days to collect materials and solicit opinions. It is scheduled to depart for Nanjing by both water and land routes this morning. At 7:00 p.m. last night, the chairman of the commission, Lord Lytton, gave a farewell speech to foreign journalists. Details of various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e10">Receiving Representatives from Various Countries <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Inquiry Commission received representatives from various countries at Room 602 of the Cathay Hotel yesterday morning from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Those who went to visit included: representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Bei Songsun; representatives from charitable organizations, Xu Shiying and Wang Yiting; the General Labor Union, Chuan Dewei, Lu Jingshi, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Yu Xianting, Chen Peide, Li Yongxiang, and Weng Ruifu; representatives from the Chinese Christian National Salvation Association, Zhu Xiangcheng, Luo Yunyan, Liang Xiaochu, and Ying Shugui. There were also many others from the Municipal Federation, various road business federations, women's representatives, Ren Jinpin, and Qu Zhenhua. They also submitted a petition with the opinions of 700,000 Shanghai residents to Lord Lytton.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Chamber of Commerce Representatives' Conversation <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>When the City Chamber of Commerce representatives Wang Xiaolai, etc., met with the Inquiry Commission yesterday morning, Mr. Xie Fusheng acted as the interpreter. The following is a record of the conversation: Mr. Wang Xiaolai asked, "How do you feel about the unprecedented disaster after the investigation of the war zone?" Lord Lytton replied, "This matter is extremely tragic. After our inspection, we will work harder to prevent this from happening again. The detailed report will be announced after we return to Geneva." American representative Major General McCoy asked, "It is said that the Chinese government has no ability to govern the entire country, but in this incident, the Chinese leaders have handled the relief of refugees in a very organized and effective manner. We have also heard of organizations such as the Municipal Maintenance Association. Is this good result due to the people's own initiative or under the guidance of the government?" Mr. Wang Xiaolai replied, "The Chinese people have always been very unified, regardless of provincial boundaries. Although there are political upheavals and different political views, they have always been united against foreign aggression." Lytton asked, "I remember that during the banquet hosted by the City Chamber of Commerce, I said that if the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce could be appointed as plenipotentiary representatives for peace talks and participate in mediation meetings, the result would be good. I also mentioned this to Japanese businessmen during my trip to Japan. If this is indeed the case, then when you are elected as representatives, how will you speak on behalf of China during the meeting?" Mr. Bei Songsun replied, "Peace proposals should not be manipulated by anyone. Both sides should be open and honest, and the result will naturally be good. However, in recent years, Japan has made a big mistake by trying to use force to solve the Eastern problem. I don't know that this method is more likely to arouse resentment among our people. In recent years, patriotic sentiments have surged in our country. If Japan uses force to suppress it, it is impossible. If we seek good results from negotiations, we must abolish military interference in politics. In recent years, warlords in China have gradually disappeared, and military leaders pay great attention to public opinion and have entered the path of civil rule. What are your opinions on the separation of military and civilian rule?" Yuan Ludeng replied, "In 1926, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, etc., and I went to Osaka to visit the electrical industry exhibition. At that time, the Japanese government and people strongly advocated Sino-Japanese friendship. The delegation was warmly welcomed by various cities in Japan. The Mayor of Osaka discussed Sino-Japanese friendship with Yu Qiaqing and gave a speech to 50,000 people, feeling that both sides were very sincere at the time. Sino-Japanese friendship can indeed be realized. Since 1926, in the past five or six years, there have been no incidents of boycotting Japanese goods, and Japanese tourist groups have come to China in an endless stream. I remember that one time there were more than 1,000 people, which can prove it. Today, the scene of warm reception in the past has been completely destroyed. It is painful to say." Wang Xiaolai replied, "To fundamentally resolve the Sino-Japanese problem, the Japanese government must invoke the responsibilities it has assumed in repeated international statements and respect China's territorial and administrative integrity. As for the issue of the Eastern Provinces, China is very much in favor of the Open Door policy, but it must be stated that it is based on not undermining China's territorial and administrative integrity. The initial motive for today's Sino-Japanese dispute originated from the Wanbaoshan Incident, followed by the massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea, and then the organization of the Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Association, whose purpose was entirely to rescue the compatriots in distress. After the September 18th Shenyang Incident, Japanese troops invaded our country, and the people's morale was aroused. We were driven by conscience and had to take active action to boycott Japanese goods. On January 28th, Mayor Wu maintained Sino-Japanese relations with a spirit of sacrifice, and initially accepted the Japanese request to cancel the Anti-Japanese Association and other conditions. However, after the Japanese warlords expressed their satisfaction in the Japanese consulate, they immediately attacked Zhabei. The British location was not beyond the road built by the concession, and the Japanese opened fire west of the Songhu Road. The saying that the Chinese army fired first and the Japanese army retaliated can be disproved. Japan's actions were so unexpected that the people of Shanghai suffered great losses in life and property. What is its intention? We have been thinking about it and cannot understand it, which led to the boycott of Japanese goods being carried out vigorously, and orders were placed with Europe and the United States for more than tens of millions. For example, the Piddow factory in Mongiestoft, England, which had stopped production, reopened after receiving Chinese orders. After the Japanese army invaded, the city's commerce was suspended, and all countries suffered. We speculate that Japan may have been hit by the boycott of goods and put the entire Shanghai international trade to death."</p>
<h3 id="e12">Labor Union Representatives' Conversation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union, in view of the serious impact of the Sino-Japanese Incident on workers' unemployment, felt it necessary to state the details and the opinions of the entire labor community to the International Inquiry Commission. On the 23rd of this month, it sent a letter to the commission, detailing the truth of the incident and the Chinese nation's hopes for the commission. Fearing that the written statement was incomplete, it also consulted with the commission and scheduled a conversation at the Cathay Hotel at 11:30 a.m. yesterday. The General Labor Union specially prepared a formal presentation letter, which was presented by representatives Chuan Dewei, Lu Jingshi, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Yu Xianting, Chen Peide, Li Yongxiang, and Weng Duanfu. Due to the fact that representatives from various groups in this city were presenting their views, the commission did not receive them until about 1:00 p.m. Chuan Dewei gave a speech on behalf of the group. In addition to reiterating the opinions contained in the previous official letter, he made sincere statements on the current political situation in China, the background of the puppet state of Manchuria under the protection of the Japanese, and the serious impact of worker unemployment. Finally, Lord Lytton gave a reply on behalf of the commission, saying that the investigation would focus on facts and that the commission welcomed the acceptance of the points stated.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Xu Shiying and Others' Statements <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>At noon yesterday (25th), Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Zhao Jinqing, Li Zushen, and Cha Mianzhong, etc., went to the Cathay Hotel to visit the League of Nations Inquiry Commission. Mr. Xu presented his views, saying, "Gentlemen, I am here on behalf of the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Relief Association. After the Japanese occupied the three eastern provinces and invaded and destroyed Shanghai, I would like to extend a warm welcome. I went to Geneva in 1910 and saw its beautiful mountains and rivers and its rich cultural relics, which contained an atmosphere of peace that made people happy. To this day, I still long for it. You have come from this peaceful city to the East, and you must have brought this peaceful atmosphere with you. You have two major missions: (1) to uphold justice, (2) to maintain humanity. Because of these two meanings, I dare to hope that you will not be succumbed by any resistance, so that you will not fail these two major missions, and you will not be blinded by any temptation, so that the true situation of the damage suffered by the three eastern provinces and Shanghai, and the facts, and those who should be responsible for them, cannot be completely and fairly expressed to the world." In addition to the above hopes, Mr. Xu also discussed the world's permanent peace methods, holding a thorough disarmament conference, implementing the abolition of all deadly weapons, and using them to transform practical agricultural and industrial machinery, striving for the development of industry, in order to save the world's economic panic, which is a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Christian Representatives' Visit <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, representatives from the Chinese Christian National Salvation Association, Zhu Maocheng, Luo Yunyan, Liang Xiaochu, Ying Shugui, and Jin Wuzhou, etc., visited the League of Nations Inquiry Commission, detailing that Japan's occupation of China by force was destroying the world's rule of law and the situation of permanent peace. Fortunately, the League of Nations Inquiry Commission paid attention to it, and said that Japan's occupation of China was contemptuous of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Non-War Treaty, and all international laws. If it is allowed to act without restriction, the great chaos of the world is at hand. Lord Lytton asked, "What are your opinions on how this matter should be resolved?" They replied, "Japan should be ordered to return the Eastern Provinces to our country, and it should also be ordered to bear the losses suffered by China due to its destruction of the League of Nations Covenant." They asked, "What will China do after it recovers the Eastern Provinces?" They replied, "This is China's internal affairs, and Japan has no right to interfere. However, our country has concrete plans for rectifying internal affairs, and the implementation of local autonomy will also include the Eastern Provinces." They asked, "Japan claims that bandits are rampant in the Eastern Provinces and is unwilling to withdraw troops. What about this?" They replied, "This is just an excuse, not a fact. Please look at the area around the South Manchurian Railway before the September 18th Incident, there was no mention of bandits." It is heard that the association has compiled a concrete opinion book on the Sino-Japanese Incident and the situation of various churches in Shanghai, and will send it to the Inquiry Commission for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Various Public Organizations' Opinion Books <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Since the League of Nations Inquiry Commission arrived in Shanghai, the local Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, the General Federation of Commerce, the Municipal Federation, the French Concession Business Federation, and the Chinese National Salvation Ten-Person Group Federation, etc., entrusted the Minsheng Publishing House to compile a common opinion book and hold a consent signature. The book was completed and printed the day before yesterday. According to the signature statistics as of yesterday morning, there were a total of 112 public organizations, 6,735 business firms, 12 schools, and 13,891 individuals, totaling 70,3391 people. There were also many public organizations, schools, business firms, and individuals in this city and other cities who requested the printing and distribution of opinion books in preparation for continuing to sign. Yesterday, Jiang Junyi and Qu Zhenzhang, etc., delivered the opinion book and the signature book to the Cathay Hotel and handed them to the Inquiry Commission. The opinion book was exquisitely printed in the style of ancient times using Lian Shi paper. There were 16 signature books, each with 100 pages, totaling 1,600 pages, along with a suspended case attachment in one book, a total of 18 books, all packaged in an ancient-style brocade box, which attracted the attention of the Inquiry Commission. Dr. Gu Weijun and Chen Liting, who were present at the time, all called it a valuable contribution from the Shanghai people. When the two representatives, Jiang and Qu, were about to leave, they stated to the Inquiry Commission that the opinion book presented was based on the League of Nations Covenant and was a legal interpretation. There were other opinions and how to deliver the continued signature book. Please ask the Inquiry Commission to indicate the method. Lord Lytton decided to entrust Dr. Gu Weijun to collect and forward the book. The two representatives did not have a long conversation because the Inquiry Commission had to go to other appointments. After returning, they sent another official letter to Dr. Gu Weijun to forward it to the Inquiry Commission to state their intentions.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Lytton's Farewell Speech <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Lord Lytton, chairman of the League of Nations Inquiry Commission and British Commissioner, met with foreign journalists at the Cathay Hotel on the eighth floor last night at 7:00 p.m. and gave a farewell speech before leaving Shanghai. The journalists asked questions at will, and the lord answered them in detail. The conversation lasted about half an hour before they shook hands and dispersed. The main points of the questions and answers are summarized and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e17">Very Happy in Shanghai <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Lord said: This time, I was ordered to come to China and visited the commercial center of the metropolis. I was warmly received by all sectors and met with leaders in Shanghai. I learned the opinions of the Chinese people, which made me very happy.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Cease Hostilities <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of my arrival in Shanghai, I met with the journalists and expressed my hope to witness the complete cessation of hostilities and the cessation of hostile acts between China and Japan before I left Shanghai. In terms of today's state, it can be said that my wishes have been satisfied. The ceasefire conference is in progress. After the ceasefire and troop withdrawal are implemented, whether to convene a so-called round-table conference or take other second steps will be handled by the League of Nations.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Thoughts on Visiting the War Zone <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>I have deeply felt the pain of military destruction during this visit to the war zones of Zhabei, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Wusong. The effort to promote world peace is even more necessary. And I feel that my mission is even more important.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Date of Stay in Liaoning <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>After the first step of the investigation work in Shanghai is completed, I will go to Nanjing to exchange opinions with the National Government authorities, and then go to Beiping to meet with Zhang Xueliang, etc., to enrich the investigation data. However, the information obtained in Nanjing and Beiping is all theoretical investigation work. It will not be until I arrive in Liaoning that I can conduct on-the-spot inspections and investigate the details of the Liaoning case dispute. It is expected that I will stay in various parts of the Northeast for about three or four weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Revisit China in Mid-July <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>After the Northeast investigation is completed, I will return to Tokyo and contact the Japanese government in detail to seek the will of the Japanese side. I will come to China again from Japan in mid-July to have a final consultation with the Chinese government authorities, and then make a general report and send it to Geneva. It is expected that it will be completed in August. As for the local report of the Shanghai incident, the Shanghai consular group is responsible for it. During the stay in Shanghai, the investigation team did not receive any instructions from Geneva, nor did it issue any report.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Purely Sightseeing Trip to Hangzhou <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Earl also stated that the three commissioners from the United States, France, and Germany were traveling to Hangzhou and then on to Nanjing purely for sightseeing purposes and were not conducting any investigation work. The rumors circulating outside were not factual.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Departing Shanghai This Morning <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Commission is scheduled to depart for Nanjing this morning via both land and water routes. Gu Shaochuan, the Chinese representative, originally planned to accompany General McCoy and others to Nanjing via Hangzhou. However, due to the Japanese representative Yoshida's arrival on the German ship "Dei Hua" to accompany Lord Lytton and others to Nanjing, Mr. Gu also changed his plans and boarded the "Dei Hua" to Nanjing. He appointed Secretary-General Wang Guangqi and Chief of the General Affairs Section Zhang Xianglin to accompany General Claudel and others to Hangzhou. Mr. Gu will first go to the South Railway Station this morning to see them off, and after the train departs at 9:15 AM, he will then go to the EWO Wharf to board the "Dei Hua."</p>

<p>Former Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian went to Hangzhou yesterday to prepare for the reception arrangements, as the Investigation Commission is visiting Hangzhou for sightseeing today.

<p>Suzhou, 25th Special Dispatch: Yesterday, on the 25th, there was a small skirmish between Chinese and Japanese outposts in Hongmiao, eastern suburb of Taicang, resulting in two enemy injuries. To facilitate transportation, the enemy in Liuhe doubled the width of the Shanghai-bound automobile road. Taicang is safe, and shops have reopened. One Japanese plane flew over Suzhou at noon on the 25th, opening fire in front of the old school in the city, without causing any casualties. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Movement of Japanese Warships in the Yangtze River <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Seemingly Headed West: Although the Japanese side is in the midst of the ceasefire conference, the transportation and replenishment of the Japanese army are still being carried out actively, and the digging of trenches and fortifications at the front is even busier. On the naval side, the fleet is being successively transferred into the Yangtze River, with a clear westward movement. My friend Mr. Chen, who returned to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday, informed the reporter in person about the actions of the Japanese Navy in the Yangtze River he witnessed. As this matter is of great importance, it is recorded in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Japanese Warships Gathered in Hankou <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>There are many Japanese expatriates in Hankou. Usually, the First Foreign Detachment of the Japanese Navy stations four warships there for defense. Since the Shanghai war broke out, the number of Japanese warships has increased to seven. This time, Commander Shiozawa took the flagship Ataka to Hankou, ostensibly to inspect the Yangtze River Navy. After arriving in Hankou, he immediately convened a meeting of the warships to discuss the issue of warship stationing. When my friend left Shanghai on the 23rd, there were already thirteen Japanese warships in Hankou. As of yesterday, a certain Yangtze River steamer in this port received a wireless report from Hankou stating that two more Japanese warships had rushed to Hankou to participate in the Shiozawa conference.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Current Status of Japanese Warships Downstream <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>From Jiujiang to Nanjing, Japanese warships mostly travel back and forth within this section of the river, with fewer ships anchoring in a fixed location. According to my friend's observations, along the Yangtze River, there are three Japanese warships in Jiujiang, one in Anqing, three near Wuhu, and three Japanese gunboats and destroyers, as well as one armored gunboat, stationed in places such as Xiaguan and Pukou in Nanjing. There are also three or four Japanese warships patrolling between Nanjing and Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Transport Ship Aground <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Navy frequently transports military equipment and soldiers within the Yangtze River, and there are also many ships sailing directly from Japan. Recently, the Japanese military transport ship "Kamiumi Maru" changed the color of its hull, loaded with military supplies, and sailed to Hankou. When it reached the lower reaches of Jiujiang, it suddenly ran aground. Upon receiving the news, the Japanese Navy immediately dispatched two warships to tow it. By yesterday afternoon, it was reported that it had been towed out and taken to Hankou for unloading. It is reported that the bottom of the ship had been damaged.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Yangtze River Steamers Still Used for Military Purposes <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Since February 1st, Japanese steamers on the Yangtze River have been entirely used for military purposes. The company logos on the smokestacks have been painted over, and the ship names have been removed, all painted black. Seven of Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's upstream and downstream Yangtze River steamers have been handled in the same way, transporting grain and military equipment back and forth between Shanghai and Hankou for more than two months. Fearing obstacles along the way, the ships are equipped with the national flags of China, Britain, and Japan to be raised as needed to confuse people. Most of the stokers and sailors on board have been replaced by White Russians.</p>

<p>A fleet of Japanese warships arrived in Liuhe on the 24th and stayed for about 20 hours. It was reported that soldiers were transferred to the ships from Liuhe. At noon yesterday, the four Japanese warships had left. Two fleets of Japanese warships, totaling nine ships, are still anchored in the Yawo Estuary outside Wusong. There were only six ships in Wusong the day before yesterday, but yesterday the number increased to nine. Yesterday, a friend who arrived in Shanghai from the Wusongkou saw four Japanese warships patrolling back and forth in the Huangpu River. In addition, there are about six or seven Japanese warships docked outside various ports in the Yangtze River.</p>

<p>Commander Houtong and others left Shanghai on the Anan Maru: The main force of the Japanese 11th Division troops had been departing for their home country in succession from the 21st to the 24th. Yesterday was the day the last units left Shanghai. The main force of the 44th Brigade, along with engineers, transport troops, and other miscellaneous troops, boarded transport ships at the Zhanghuabang Railway Wharf in Wusong at 11:00 AM yesterday. Lieutenant General Houtong, along with the two brigade commanders of his subordinates, Tokushima and Zentsuji, and officers from the headquarters, boarded the Anan Maru at the same time. A torpedo boat from the 26th Detachment of the Japanese Navy was specially dispatched to escort them to Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Statement on the National Crisis Conference <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association expressed five propositions to the members of the National Crisis Conference and called for a unified national response. It recently sent a document to various organizations both locally and abroad, which is recorded as follows: To all organizations, institutions, fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, uncles, and aunts across the country, respectfully, the National Crisis Conference is about to be convened. Our Association believes that although the members of this conference are not publicly elected by the people, there is currently no appropriate organization to represent the public opinion. This conference can serve as a mouthpiece for our poor and helpless people, expressing everything they have endured and wanted to say for the past five years, so that the government authorities can realize and accommodate them. Perhaps this could create a new situation in politics and a new way out for the nation. It is not necessarily a bad opportunity, and it is also believed that from the people's standpoint, we should rise up together, clearly express our propositions and hopes to the invited members. Our Association has already telegraphed the government and held a tea party to entertain various members in Shanghai, exchanging opinions, which have been reported in the newspapers. I hope you have seen it. All that has been commonly agreed upon by the members of our Association are as follows: 1. We hope that all members of the National Crisis Conference will attend, and by no means should they harbor any sense of disappointment. 2. We hope that the members of the National Crisis Conference will cooperate with the government with a purely well-intentioned spirit to promote internal reforms and quickly determine a policy towards Japan. 3. We hope that the members of the National Crisis Conference will propose concise and practical proposals, and request the government to accept them with the utmost sincerity and determination, and implement their main points</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>as follows: (1) Issue a decree allowing people to openly organize political groups, (2) Stop issuing funds to party branches at all levels, (3) Gather talents from across the country to form a national crisis government, (4) Begin implementing constitutional government within three months, (5) Establish a representative body of public opinion within five months. 4. We hope that the members of the National Crisis Conference can use this meeting to establish an organization to assist the government in implementing constitutional government. Our Association should continue to promote and propagate the above propositions in every possible way to be effective. Only with a common voice can we seek response, and only with everyone working together can we make things easier. At this time of national crisis, when the whole country is in panic, we must gather the public together to act together to reverse this dangerous situation. We hope that you will consider and support our propositions. The conditions do not need to be entirely the same, but the expression of them should not be delayed. We deeply believe that we are not alone, and the country may have a chance. This is respectfully submitted, and we wish you well. Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association, March 25, 21st year.</p>

<p>Since the January 28th Incident, all industries have been on strike to resist aggression, persisting until now for nearly two months. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has solicited opinions from its members, and among the 160 trade associations, more than 80 advocated for reopening, accounting for the majority. However, the Municipal Federation of Citizens' Associations and the various Road Merchants' Associations decided in a general meeting to continue the strike to show their determination to resist, as the Japanese army continued its offensive. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to take care of the difficulties of merchants and maintain the livelihoods of workers, specially ordered the Municipal Federation of Citizens' Associations and the various Road Merchants' Associations yesterday to persuade all industries to resume business from today onwards, in order to avoid losses.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Two Groups Scheduled to Discuss the Issue of Reopening <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Citizens' Associations and the various Road General Merchants' Associations, in order to implement the strike to resist aggression, had previously notified all stores in the city not to reopen until the government had made a firm statement. Now, it has learned that in addition to receiving a telegram from the National Government explaining the situation of reinforcements, it also received an order from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, advising them to reopen as soon as possible. The association believes that this is a major issue and has scheduled an emergency meeting for tomorrow (the 27th) afternoon, and invited representatives from the French Concession General Merchants' Association to participate in a joint discussion to decide whether to reopen.</p>

<p>And Urges Tenants Not to Default: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an urgent notice yesterday to urge landlords to voluntarily reduce rent and tenants to pay off arrears, stating that "In recent days, the Rice Trade Association, Sausage Trade Association, Dried Goods Trade Association, Fenjiu Trade Association, and other trade associations have sent letters one after another, mostly stating that Shanghai is affected by the war, material resources are depleted, and suggesting rent reduction, etc. After deliberation, it is believed that Jinghang has already implemented rent reduction. Shanghai has been bombarded by the violent Japanese artillery and aircraft for more than a month, and houses have been reduced to ruins. The suffering of the citizens is unprecedented since the opening of the port. Therefore, this is published to inform you that we hope all landlords and tenants will follow the principle of mutual assistance. Landlords should take the initiative to reduce rent to show compassion, and tenants should also take into account the difficulties of landlords and no longer default on rent, in order to take care of both parties. This is our hope. This is specially notified."</p>

Upon hearing this news, the reporter rushed to Rue Pichon and the French General Police Station to inquire, but both denied it. In order to clarify the facts, the reporter repeatedly inquired and learned that it was a misreport of a bomb being found in the residence of Finance Minister Song Ziwen. Shigemitsu and Song's residences are both on Rue Pichon, and the time was indeed at 3:00 PM, which led to this misinformation.</p>

<p>The Police Destroyed the Bomb to Avoid Accidents: At around 10:00 AM yesterday, there was a sudden loud noise in the southwest of the French Concession, which shook the area. As a result, residents were suspicious and speculated. Some said that it was a Japanese plane dropping a bomb, and others said that it was vandals causing trouble. This newspaper reporter went to various places to inquire, and the truth was revealed. The French police had found an abandoned shell about one foot and four inches long on the open space opposite No. 741 on Route Tenant de la Tour the day before yesterday. After the police picked it up, they were deeply afraid that it would cause accidents, so they specially transported the shell to the shooting range yesterday and tried to destroy it, resulting in a very loud noise.</p>

<p>Notice: Collection to Resume After the Situation Calms Down: The Shanghai County Finance Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating that "We have received a telegram from acting JiangSu Finance Department Commissioner Xian stating, 'The grain tax of 1931 in the county has previously been extended by one month.

<p>Due to a Shortage of Raw Materials: The Dachunghua Match Company's Yingchang Factory in Lujiadu, Pudong, is divided into two parts, east and west, with a total of more than 2,000 male and female workers.

<p>After the great battle in Jiangwan, Miaoxing, Dachang, and Zhabei, corpses were scattered everywhere, a tragic sight to behold. The Tongren Fushan Hall, Chongshan Hall, Pushan Villa, and other benevolent groups organized burial teams to go to the war zone to carry out burials, as reported in various newspapers. Now, it is heard that the Red Swastika Society believes that the war zones are vast, the dead are piled up, and the corpses in the trenches and small pools have been rotting for a long time, emitting a foul odor. If no measures are taken to bury them, it will be detrimental to the public health of the city. Given the current situation, it is necessary to divide the work and cooperate with various benevolent halls. At the same time, Wang Weiguan of the Delong Tobacco Company, through the Jiangwan Chongshan Hall, has been providing the Red Swastika Society's burial team with unlimited materials to collect the remains of the war zone. The society's original relief team has now expanded its burial operations and has dispatched all team members and two Japanese translators to Jiangwan, Dachang, and other areas to carry out burials, along with many rolls of white cloth and countless bottles of disinfectant. The team is currently based at Shen Bingxiang's residence in Jinjiamuqiao, Dachang, and reports that there are many corpses everywhere, urgently requiring division of labor and more manpower. The team has hired local workers. The society has also printed daily collection report forms for investigation.</p>

<p>Shanghai Lida Academy, located south of the Jiangwan Railway Station, was established six and a half years ago. In recent years, it has promoted vocational education with remarkable results. During the recent Japanese attack on Jiangwan, the academy was repeatedly bombarded with artillery and planes dropping bombs from the air. The school buildings and farms were severely damaged. According to the person in charge of the academy, who went to investigate yesterday, the chicken farm and bee farm near the Pao Ma Tingfu and the teacher's dormitory on the south side of the school have all been reduced to ashes. The girls' dormitory, bathroom, gymnasium, and teacher's residences in the school building were all bombed. The classrooms, offices, and boys' dormitory were all riddled with bullet holes. There were still more than a dozen unexploded 6-inch shells on the sports field. Near the girls' dormitory, there was still the corpse of one of our soldiers, with exposed bones, a tragic sight to behold. After the 19th Route Army changed its strategy and withdrew from Jiangwan, Japanese soldiers once occupied the school. All the equipment was either destroyed or moved away, and now there is nothing left. Even the indoor electric lights and wires did not escape. The total loss is estimated to be more than 260,000 yuan. The school was originally run by several comrades who saved money and cut expenses. After this disaster, it will be difficult to recover in a short time. It is heard that a temporary office has been set up in Bashi Bridge, Wuxi, to handle the transfer of students from the academy, and a communication office has been set up in Shanghai at No. A749, Renxing Lane, Broadway Road.</p>

<p>Because Digging Trenches Triggered Unexploded Shells:</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Japanese 9th Division is located in Baoshan City, and the headquarters of the 4th Company is located in the Zhanghuabang Railway Factory in Wusong. Several days ago, the 6th Company, consisting of more than 500 infantry soldiers, arrived in Yangxing Town. The company headquarters is located in the Cheng family's house in the town. After the company arrived in Yangxing, it was very busy digging trenches and building fortifications around the town. At 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, a small squad of Japanese soldiers, about 20 people, were digging trenches north of Yangjia Temple in the north of the town. Unexpectedly, there was a large shell dropped by a Japanese warship underground, which had not exploded. When the Japanese soldiers used an iron shovel to dig the trench, it triggered the shell. With a loud bang, one Japanese soldier was blown to pieces, and the other two had their bodies separated and blown into several pieces. The other Japanese soldiers were shocked and panicked upon hearing the sound, jumping out of the trenches and fleeing for their lives. Many were injured. The residents of the town were also greatly frightened by the sudden loud noise.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, In your newspaper on the 17th, you published the will of the former county magistrate of our county, Wu, which contained the phrase "the Public Security and Construction Bureaus are not under command." After investigation, from March 2nd in Kunyi County, Japanese planes came to the city in squadrons, throwing bombs and shooting guns. The people fled, and order was disrupted. At that time, a large army passed through, hiring boats, recruiting laborers, building bridges, and other matters came in succession. Former county magistrate Wu, feeling the difficulty in coping, temporarily avoided the countryside. The Public Security and Construction Bureaus handled various matters, and there may have been shortcomings due to factual obstacles. There is no factual basis for the claim that they were not under the command of the county magistrate, based on interviewing public opinion. Now, local people have also stated that Director Qin of the Public Security Bureau has maintained order effectively and have telegraphed the province for commendation. An order has been received from the provincial government to have the Department of Civil Affairs issue a commendation order. Fearing that distant parties may not understand the truth, we hereby request correction. Respectfully, Cheng Ruji, the newly appointed county magistrate of Kunshan County, bowing, March 23rd.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Luo Wen'gan's Remarks Amidst the Ceasefire Conference <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wen'gan spoke to reporters on the afternoon of the 25th, saying, "The Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference in Shanghai on the 24th made little progress because the Japanese proposals exceeded the scope agreed upon by the Sino-Japanese diplomatic representatives. Our representatives insisted on proceeding with the discussion according to the original agreement. This morning the conference will continue. There seems to be some misunderstanding in the outside world regarding this conference. In fact, this conference is to discuss and determine the cessation of hostile acts and the methods for the withdrawal of Japanese troops based on the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly. It is not the so-called round-table conference. Our position is based on the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly and the resolution of the League of Nations Special Committee, and only military matters are being discussed, not political issues. If the Japanese side can adopt the same attitude and negotiate sincerely, then the League of Nations resolution can be implemented, and peace can be expected to be realized. If the Japanese side is led by military personnel and raises issues of a political nature, then it is feared that there will be no good results. Since the Dong Incident, our country has respected international conventions and firmly believes that justice will not be trampled by power. Therefore, except for resorting to legitimate self-defense and resistance when necessary, we have always fulfilled the resolutions of the League of Nations. The reason why our country submitted the matter to the League of Nations and repeatedly urged the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris to pay serious attention is not because we rely on the League of Nations and the conventions, but because our country is one of the allied countries and should fulfill the responsibilities of a signatory country, while urging each of the signatory countries to jointly maintain the dignity of international conventions. However, the Japanese army violated international conventions, disregarded the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations, ignored peace in East Asia, and abused military force. The League of Nations has also failed to impose effective sanctions. Among the friendly countries, some are still blinded by Japanese propaganda. In particular, the recent remarks made by a certain country's diplomatic authorities in the parliament contain misunderstandings about our country's reality and history, which is particularly disappointing. In today's world, only China is fighting alone to maintain international conventions and fairness. The future is extremely sad. Although the Chinese people deeply love peace, the realization of the ideal of world harmony is still far away. Our country must know that justice has not yet been upheld and is still under the oppression of power. We should unite, work hard to strengthen ourselves, strive for national governance, and jointly face national difficulties. Only then will our diplomatic statements have power to speak."

<p>Cabinet Reshuffle Attempts to Prolong Life, Suzuki Formally Appointed Home Minister - Reuters, Tokyo, 25th: This morning, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi entered the palace and requested the appointment of Suzuki as Home Minister and the appointment of former South Manchuria Railway President Kawamura as Justice Minister in place of Suzuki. Both appointments were approved, and the official announcement was made this afternoon. Suzuki's reassignment as Home Minister had previously sparked intense contention between two factions within the Seiyukai party. This formal appointment necessitates prior reconciliation between these factions. However, many believe that this attempt to quell the conflict will only temporarily extend the life of the cabinet. The special session of parliament adjourned this morning.</p>

<p>Oppose Extension of Schooling, Engage in Street Battles with Police - National News Agency, Rome, 24th: The Romanian government recently issued an order requiring law and medical students to pursue several more years of postgraduate studies after graduating from university before entering the workforce. Consequently, graduating students of both faculties have risen in opposition. The unrest has intensified, leading to riots at the nation's two most prestigious universities. Students at the University of Bucharest, led by members of the Iron Guard, a group that excludes Jews, initially staged demonstrations in front of the university for three consecutive days. When authorities attempted to suppress the students, conflict erupted. Eventually, troops were dispatched to assist the police, using firearms to suppress the demonstrators, resulting in forty student injuries. Following this, students at the University of Caza in the Caza region also began demonstrating. When police attempted to disperse them, the students resisted with pistols, iron bars, and wooden clubs, scattering the encircling police force. Five police officers and several students were seriously injured. Subsequently, students formed groups and proceeded to vandalize the local synagogue. When police reinforcements arrived, they used bayonets to drive the students away. The students then retreated to their dormitories and opened fire on the police, resulting in a fierce battle. Three police officers and two students were killed. Finally, police stormed the dormitories and arrested all the students inside, including twenty who were injured and escorted to the hospital by police. The University of Caza has now been suspended indefinitely, and the city is in a state of great unrest, with rumors rampant. The situation is not easily resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Japanese and Russian Troops Growing Closer <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Army Adds Brigade to Open Up Harbin-Suifenhe Line - Japanese Planes Fly to Russian Border for Reconnaissance, Forced to Retreat - Harbin Correspondence: Soviet Russia's active preparations for war are fully understood by the Japanese. The Japanese brigade stationed in Hailin is no longer engaging in external activities to prevent Soviet Russian troops, and is now concentrated in Yimianpo Mudanjiang, watching the movements of the Russians. The commander of the Japanese garrison in Harbin, Tamon, had intended to return to Liaoning, but has suspended his departure. The Kwantung Army Headquarters has decided to significantly increase troop strength along the Harbin-Suifenhe line, ostensibly to intercept Ding Chao's Self-Defense Army, but in reality, it is to guard against Soviet Russia. The Murai Mixed Brigade has also been ordered to move from Harbin to Yimianpo and Zhuhe in preparation for any eventuality. The Japanese Consulate in Harbin has negotiated with the Eastern Railway Bureau for four train cars, which are scheduled to depart in the next few days. Ding Chao's army and the National Salvation Army are luring Japanese troops forward, bringing the Japanese and Russian forces closer and closer. Su Bingwen's troops on the Harbin-Manchuria line are employing the same strategy as Ding Chao. The Japanese seem to have detected this, and have halted troop deployments to the area between Manchuria and Hailar. Currently, they are pressing Ma Zhanshan to dispatch troops to attack the Soviets, but Ma has no troops to spare, leaving the Japanese helpless.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 17th of this month, a Japanese aircraft flew from Hailin to the Russian border to conduct reconnaissance outside Suifenhe. Russian forces spotted the plane and immediately scrambled six aircraft to pursue it. The Japanese plane fled in haste, and the Russian planes chased it as far as the vicinity of Maqiaohe inside Suifenhe before returning to their territory. The Russian Consulate in Harbin protested to the Japanese Consulate in Harbin about this incident. The Japanese side apologized, claiming that the pilot was unfamiliar with the geography and mistakenly entered friendly territory, resolving the matter.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia recently secretly transported Eastern Railway vehicles back to Russia. The Japanese side then instructed the local puppet authorities to issue the following regulations on restricting the exit of vehicles, implemented by the railway police: 1. All vehicles and materials in the Eastern Railway General Factory and the General Materials Factory, as well as all materials at material factories along the line, shall be fully protected by officers and police from the relevant police stations. Additional police officers shall be dispatched on a rotating basis to monitor them. If any attempts to transport them are discovered, the destination must be inquired and immediately telegraphed to the police department for instructions. The audit bureau will then be notified to investigate. If the audit bureau proves that the transportation is not intended for smuggling out of the country, it may be released; otherwise, it shall be strictly prohibited. 2. After the audit bureau certifies that the goods have been shipped to a certain station, the police at the point of origin shall record the number and type of vehicles being transported, report them to the police department, and instruct the railway police station at the destination to re-inspect and monitor them to prevent external transportation. 3. When vehicles are loaded at each station, the railway police station at that station must, in conjunction with the auditors at each station, verify that the vehicles are indeed needed by the Eastern Railway itself and are not intended to leave the country before allowing shipment. 4. When vehicles and materials arrive at each station, the railway police station should dispatch police officers to monitor and report the vehicle numbers and material quantities to prevent repeated transportation. 5. Manzhouli and Suifenhe are the gateways in and out of the country and should have senior police officers assigned by the section chief to rotate duties. If vehicles and materials are pulled out of the country, the section chief, together with the auditors and Chinese staff of the locomotive section at that station, must inform the stationmaster and be responsible for preventing it; otherwise, the section chief will be held accountable. 6. Protecting railway property is a matter of great responsibility. If any officer or staff member fails to perform their duties or neglects to prevent violations, they will be severely punished without leniency. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e105">Huge Bribery Case Involving Former Japanese Cabinet <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Meiji Sugar Company Tax Evasion Case: The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that the Meiji Sugar Company tax evasion case has suddenly expanded. On the 18th, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office charged former Minseito party member Eijiro Nihoshi, the editor of a certain economic magazine, and the company's supervisory secretary. Secret investigations by the Metropolitan Police Department revealed that five former cabinet heavyweights were heavily involved in the case. The Public Prosecutors Office considers this to be an unprecedented case of malfeasance and bribery. The investigation found that around 1930, about 6 million yuan in taxes were evaded through the secret import of raw sugar, plus 4 million yuan in product excise tax, totaling over 10 million yuan. The company concealed this matter. In June 1930, they bribed former cabinet heavyweights with 500,000 yuan for the first time and 700,000 yuan for the second time, totaling 1.2 million yuan. On September 20th, they further bribed a certain Minseito heavyweight and two assemblymen with 300,000 yuan, but the heavyweight revealed that there were 1.6 million yuan involved. Meanwhile, Umeji Nakatsu extorted bribes of 30,000 yuan. Therefore, the details are quite complex. This time, the truth has been completely exposed and involves many former cabinet heavyweights, making it a surprising and shocking scandal in Japanese history.</p>

<p>Reserve Army Organization Also in Active Progress - Hunan Representatives Urge Completion of Hunan-Guangdong-Guangxi Highway Guangzhou Communication: The Guangdong army's departure to resist Japan and suppress the communists is progressing steadily. According to recent reports, Yu Hanmou's troops entering Jiangxi have arrived at the Jiangxi border. The advance troops led by Ye Zhao have already reached Nankang. Approximately 10,000 bandits from the pseudo-First Group Army's Third Army are entrenched in areas near Nankang, such as Xincheng Village, Qinglong Township, Huanglong Township, and the old and new porcelain river areas. Approximately several thousand bandits from the pseudo-First Army have also been discovered about fifty li north of Xinfeng. Therefore, after Yu Hanmou arrived in Nanxiong, he ordered the vanguard to await orders in Nankang. He also established a military headquarters in Nanxiong and added a radio substation in Dayu to command the various armies. He also ordered the air squadron accompanying the army to fly from Nanxiong to southern Jiangxi every day to scout out bandit activity. At the same time, he is also waiting for Zhang Meixin's troops to outflank Longnan from the Dongjiang River Lianping Heping area to encircle Xinfeng and other places. He has also agreed with Chen Cheng and Ma Kun's armies stationed in Ganzhou to launch a major offensive. It is reported that Zhang Meixin's troops are advancing day and night and set off from Longnan to Xinfeng on the 16th to jointly suppress the bandits with Ye Zhao's First Army. As for Huang Renhuan's troops entering Fujian to suppress bandits, they departed from Huizhou along two routes towards the Fujian border. Zeng Youren's three regiments led by Ye Weihao, Wang Dinghua, and Wu Hanping arrived at Sanheba, a subordinate county of Meixian, on the 17th. Yan Yingyu's two regiments led by Zeng Da'er, Li Hengzhong, and Chen Shaowu arrived in Xingning on the 17th. The two brigades of Zeng and Yan are scheduled to converge in Meixian on the 18th and depart to Songkou on the 20th to join forces in entering Fujian. Huang Renhuan's division headquarters is also stationed in Meixian to command from the center. The authorities have decided to allocate 500,000 yuan from the national tax revenue to the military expenses for the bandit suppression army entering Fujian, and have already sent a letter to the Finance Special Commissioner's Office for disbursement. As for the reserve army for resisting Japan, Huang Shaoxiong returned to Guangxi to plan the organization some time ago. Yesterday, Huang returned to Guangdong after completing his mission and consulted with Li Zongren and Chen Jitang before heading north. It is reported that the recruitment of soldiers for the reserve army has already begun. He Jian of Hunan Province sent representatives He Yuanwen and Liu Zhao to Guangdong, and they have been visiting the authorities in recent days. They have reached an agreement on the major plan for resisting Japan. The representatives also discussed with the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to jointly improve transportation between the three provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. It is reported that it has been decided to complete the highway from Liangtian in Hunan Province to Lechang in Guangdong Province and the highway from Hongqiao in Hunan Province to Huangshaqiao in Guangxi Province within a time limit to facilitate military transport between the three provinces.

<p>While the ceasefire conference is underway in Songjiang Shanghai, and both sides have ceased military operations, Japanese military aircraft have been incessantly conducting reconnaissance flights for days. Every day, either at dawn or mid-morning, Japanese planes can be seen soaring high in the sky, circling back and forth. Reconnaissance was even busier on the 22nd and 23rd, with one aircraft passing over Songjiang City in the morning and another in the afternoon. School authorities have strongly advised students not to gather in the playground to watch the planes passing by.</p>
<p>In Pinghu, gray enemy aircraft have been observed flying around the county for the past two days. One wing flew from XinDai past XinCang, heading south towards ZhaPu. Another wing flew from the northeast, heading southwest. They flew very low over the suburbs outside the city, but when passing over the city, they flew into the clouds, making the engine sound difficult to discern.</p>
<p>In Wuxi, at 9:40 AM on the 22nd, a Japanese aircraft flew from the east to reconnoiter Wuxi, circling the city once before flying east again. On the morning of the 23rd, the aircraft returned and flew east again.</p>
