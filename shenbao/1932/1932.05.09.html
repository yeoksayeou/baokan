<h3 id="c1">五九痛言 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>在一部國恥歷史中。「五九」爲最足以令吾人悲憤沉痛永永不能忘却之一頁。而今日則恰爲「五九」之十七度紀念。</p>
<p>五九國恥之由來。即爲民國四年日本藉口我國要求取消日本對德宣戰在山東劃定之軍事範圍。爲非友誼之行動。有辱帝國的尊嚴。一月十八日夜秘密用陸軍省繪有無畏艦及機關砲之公用箋。寫出亡我國家滅我種族之二十一條。談判經過二十四次。最後於五月七日午後三時。向我提出通牒。限於五月九日午後六時以前爲滿意之答覆。並迫我嚴守秘密。此亡國之二十二條。終於在北洋軍閥政府一手包辦之情勢下。於十七年前之今日。屈服於日本之最後通牒。雖直至今日。此亡國之條約。我人民終始不承認其有效。然而迴想十七年前我國家之危殆情形。以及日本强横之壓迫。與軍閥官僚之甘心賣國。輒覺感情内激。悲憤而不能自巳。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人之所以紀念過去之國恥。不在於重翻舊賬。徒作往事之追念。而在於認取往事之敎訓。並把握其因果。尤其在今日情勢危殆不可終朝之國難中。而紀念過去之五九。則應於接受五九之敎訓外。更共同振起作艱苦之奮鬥。以打破當前之國難。若徒低迴往事。作無謂之追念。無意義之感喟。則巳往之國恥。固巳數不勝數。而未來之國恥。恐將續出無窮。五年或十年之後。將無日而非我國之國恥。甚且吾人即欲紀念國恥而亦不可得矣。</p>
<p>當日本對我提出二十一條之際。正值歐洲大戰方酣之時。此時歐洲美列强。都無力顧及遠東。最爲我國維新自强之好機會。然以袁世凱之夢想復活帝制之死灰。欲造成袁家一統之天下。不奮起走上維新之路。反而開時代之倒車。甚且引狼入室。欲憑其助力。以實現帝王之迷夢。於是外侮乃乘𨻶而入。痛心之二十一條。乃突然提出。而五九之國恥。於以造成。由是可知「國必自侮而後人侮之」之語。實爲至理名言。而北洋軍閥誤國禍國之罪戾。實爲無可容恕。</p>
<p>然而豈僅北洋軍閥之誤國禍國而巳。當國民政府奠定南京之際。列强由嫉惡妬恨。不得不轉而表示親善。一時國際間頗呈良好之景象。此又爲我國之一絶好維新圖强之時機也。但又以政敵旣倒。天下大定。而新軍閥新官僚乃又應運而生。於是而爭權奪利。内戰連年。分崩離析。勢成割據。致國本日益動搖。民生日益凋敝。寖以陷於今日危急存亡僅存絲屬之艱境。招致去年九一八與今年一二八之慘痛。誰爲爲之。孰令致之。十七年來吾人口言國恥。紀念國恥。而國恥則日益加多。吾人試自思維。究將何以自解。是則吾人誤國禍國之罪戾。又果能爲後人所容恕耶。</p>
<p>往者巳矣。今日之事究如何。吾人日高唱廢除不平等條約。而不平等條約。恐將日益增多。故吾人今日。如甘心亡國滅種則巳。如其不甘。則亟應作實際之努力。實際之奮鬥。納政治於軌道。維新自强。以奠定我國家之新基。以應付未來世界局勢之危機。</p>
<p>來者猶可追。國人其亟起志共圖。吾人今日紀念五九者。應非爲卑怯之血涙。非爲惴弱之嘆息。而應爲睡獅醒來之、怒吼。應爲沉毅英勇之抗爭。</p>

<p>自由談錦州之義馬  鄭逸梅　　錦州爲東北名城。無戰事則巳。戰則必爭。此朱明末葉。愛親覺羅氏窺我神器。祖大壽所以擁兵守之也。此次倭人肆暴。錦州遭刧。較他處爲尤巨。於是義勇軍乃奮然而起。義氣直干雲霄。勇槪足褫敵魄。此中頗多遺聞軼事。爲報章所未載。而義馬殉主。更爲可歌可泣。使靦然爲人而作虎倀者聞之。當爲之愧死。是不可不有以紀之也。馬爲義勇軍中王紹裘團長之坐騎。王微時。以販馬爲業。愛一純白之馬。疾足致遠。奔騰之際。銀騣上指。健武無與倫比。王因以白追風名之·王固愛國好男兒。在義勇軍中。身先士卒。以殺敵爲快。設一日不血刃。則鬱怒之餘。常廢寢食。其殺敵也。輒御白追風。虎虎上戰陣。心有謀。目無敵。硝烟彈雨不顧也。然卒以此而喪厥命。所謂白追風者。爲敵所獲。由某軍官　畜之。一日。御之衝鋒。至小凌河。白追風忽如項王不逝之騅。某軍官鞭之。乃躍趨河干。某軍官失其控御力。與白追風同逐波臣而去。倭卒旣無統率。軍心頓渙散。我義勇軍乘勢反攻。大刀隊且參爲左右翼。一時授首者不可勝計。有伏地叩頭如摀蒜者。醜狀百出。悉生擒之。是役也。義勇軍之聲威動天地。從此屢戰屢勝。說者咸於白追風而歸功之。夫古人筆記。義馬殉主。傳爲談柄。然盡信書不如無書。疑出於好事者流之臆造。茲聞平友顧鏡如爲述白追風殉王團長。遂信天壤間竟有此一段義跡。洵足以光戰史巳。櫻桃花下鴛鴦塜談麗章　　夏初將屆鮮紅姣豔如美人香口之櫻桃。又復呈獻於吾人之眼簾。因此引起余親歷之一幕並命鴛鴦之傷心故事。回憶去年今時。余正買棹言旋。繫舟没湖之濱。上岸散步。道經某氏廢園。瞥見一白鬆婆娑之老嫗。趺坐於櫻桃樹下。面對雙塜。悲慟欲絶。其聲悽楚。不忍卒聽。其語爲哭聲所掩。糢糊不可辨。退而詢諸其隣。方知塜中人即爲老嫗之兒媳。而其子爲農商學校之畢業生。年甫而立。服務滬上某機關。束身自好。聲譽頗佳。而伉儷尤愛好逾恒。結褵數載。從無間言。不幸其子忽攖不起之症。纒綿匝月。醫藥罔效。其媳伉儷情殷。侍奉湯藥。無間朝夕。並焚香日禱於帝天之前。自願減壽犧牲以貸其死。詎卒不騐。當其夫易簣之前數日。竟背人仰藥以殉。謂將爲其夫先驅狐狸於地下。實踐其死則同穴之誓言。其親爲全渠志。遂將槥棺同葬於其子生前手植之櫻桃樹畔。於是每年桃實薦新時。其母必棖觸老懷。號泣於墳樹之前云云。余爲慨嘆久之。登舟解維而去。磨劍錄黃闖（上）  顧明道　　高傑别號翻山鷂。有驍勇名。降誠也。旣爲總兵。跋扈非常。史可法善撫之。傑亦誠服。惟與黃得功爭揚地。意見水火。幾成克用全忠之禍。登萊總兵黃蜚南調。道出維揚。懼爲高傑所脅。乃貽書得功。請以兵迎。蓋二黃本素交也。得功乃引輕兵三百騎。會於三义河。傑聞之。恐將襲其軍。遂别遣千人伺之。得功不知也。至土橋。解鞍下馬作食。傑伏兵猝起。黃角巾緩裝。出不意。亟擐甲。而飛矢雨集。所乘馬值千金。俄中矢而踣。黃騰上他馬以去。有十七騎追且及矣。注槊未下。黃大呼反鬥。發腰間所餘七矢。殺七人。矢盡。揮長刀。復殪其三。乃及于大軍而免。自此高黃之仇惡益深。一日黃方與部下聚宴。俄報高兵來襲。在十里外將至矣。黃笑飲自若。又報距五里。又報僅三里。飲如故也。又報巳抵城下。黃乃上馬。傍一卒授之弓。執在手。又一卒授之槍。掛於肘。又一卒授之鞭。跨左腿下。一卒授之鐧。跨右腿下。後有五騎。各負一箭筒。筒箭百。隨之往。抽箭射。疾于雨。箭盡擲弓。繼以槍。槍貫二騎。折。旋又擊死二騎。須臾擲槍。用鞭鐧雙揮之。肉雨墜。衆軍巳歌旋矣。歸而豪飲如平時。故高傑甚畏之。其後淸兵南下。黃在蕪湖力戰不屈而死。拙著海上英雄中曾詳記其事。不愧一虎將也。戎馬雙樓記（四六）  求幸福齋主人　　第六回　可憐同夢夜迫爲床下盟　猶憶初戀時負郤窗間約　　梁笑雲不待他說完。驀地失聲驚呼道。怎麽。你巳和旁人訂過了婚嗎。郤早爲什麽不說。你成心與我閙着玩嗎。你好。你好。說時。花容慘淡。語聲微帶著鳴咽。嚇得安玉田惶恐無地。也坐起來急急解釋道。你不要急。我那件事并沒曾公開宣布。只僅僅在私地裹說起過。也許可以設法打消。梁笑雲見安玉田不禁嚇惑。就吐露出可以打消的話。顯見得他是逃不出伊的手掌。遲早還是伊操著必勝之權。便微微放下心來。仍逼緊著追訊道。旣然這樣。我也不來怪你。只限你說實話。把那女人同你所經過的種種情形。通統快告訴我。讓我斟酌一番。但不准再有半句謊言。你能够依我嗎。安玉田這時巳成了被嚴刑訊問的罪犯。忙即拱手告罪道。都依你。我决不敢再欺瞞你了。於是不打自招。源源本本說出了一篇供狀。原來李問霞的父親。名呌李品齋。籍貫也與安玉田同一省分。在前淸點過進士。以大挑知縣向在外省做親民之官。素有酷吏和能員的稱號。民國以來。仍繼承縣知事的生涯。郤專在本省欺壓同鄉人。新近也還在東海邊一處縣缺的任上。這人貪鄙狠毒。小有才能。括了一生的地皮。只專喜附庸雅。收藏古董。并廣置姬妾。李問霞是他正室所生。早就成了沒有娘的苦女孩子。在那種環境惡劣的家庭中。與一般擅狐媚的後母處不來。偏伊這位父親。又還專制腐舊得極厲害。膝前雖僅有伊一個女兒。并無其他哥弟。郤絲毫不加憐愛。問霞逼得從家裹逃出來。到北京求學。他竟以女兒爲忤逆不孝。宣稱斷絶父女關係。不供給伊分文的生活與敎育費用。問霞半工半讀。外加親友們零星帮助。勉强在北京度著苦生活。只以自小兒就受惡社會的激剌太深。性情不免有些偏激。又因圖謀自立。習於奮鬥。更是非常好事。常常在社會中多有活動。</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Painful Word on May Ninth <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>By Bin</p>
<p>In the history of national humiliation, "May Ninth" is the most heart-wrenching and unforgettable page for us. Today marks the seventeenth anniversary of "May Ninth."</p>
<p>The origin of the May Ninth National Humiliation lies in the fact that in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), Japan used as an excuse China's request to cancel Japan's declaration of war against Germany in the military areas designated in Shandong. They considered this an unfriendly act and an insult to the dignity of the Empire. On the night of January 18th, they secretly used stationery from the Ministry of the Army printed with battleships and machine guns to write the Twenty-One Demands, designed to destroy our country and exterminate our race. After twenty-four negotiation sessions, they finally presented us with an ultimatum at 3:00 PM on May 7th, demanding a satisfactory reply before 6:00 PM on May 9th, and forced us to keep it secret. These Twenty-Two Demands that would lead to the country's ruin were ultimately yielded to by the Beiyang warlord government, which single-handedly controlled the situation, on this day seventeen years ago in response to Japan's ultimatum. Although to this day, our people have never recognized the validity of this treaty of national subjugation, recalling the perilous state of our country seventeen years ago, as well as Japan's forceful oppression and the willing treason of warlord officials and bureaucrats, one cannot help but feel emotional and overwhelmed with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>However, the reason we commemorate past national humiliations is not to rehash old grievances or simply reminisce about the past, but to learn from past lessons and understand the cause and effect. Especially in today's precarious national crisis, where the situation may change before the day is over, commemorating the past May Ninth should involve not only accepting the lessons of May Ninth but also jointly rising up to engage in arduous struggles to overcome the current national crisis. If we merely dwell on the past, engaging in meaningless reminiscences and futile sighs, then past national humiliations, which are already countless, will continue to emerge endlessly in the future. Five or ten years from now, there may not be a single day that is not a national humiliation for our country, and we may not even be able to commemorate national humiliation.</p>
<p>When Japan presented us with the Twenty-One Demands, it was at the height of the European War. At that time, the European and American powers were unable to pay attention to the Far East, which was a great opportunity for our country to revitalize and strengthen itself. However, Yuan Shikai dreamed of reviving the ashes of the imperial system and creating a unified world under the Yuan family. Instead of striving to embark on the path of reform, he turned back the clock. He even let the wolf into the house, hoping to rely on its help to realize his imperial dreams. As a result, foreign aggression took advantage of the situation, and the painful Twenty-One Demands were suddenly presented, leading to the national humiliation of May Ninth. From this, we can see that the saying, "A nation must first insult itself before others insult it," is indeed a profound truth, and the Beiyang warlords' crimes of misleading and harming the country are unforgivable.</p>
<p>However, it was not only the Beiyang warlords who misled and harmed the country. When the National Government established itself in Nanjing, the powers, out of jealousy and hatred, had to turn around and express goodwill. For a time, the international situation seemed good, which was another excellent opportunity for our country to revitalize and strengthen itself. But with the political enemies overthrown and the world settled, new warlords and new bureaucrats emerged. As a result, they fought for power and profit, leading to years of civil war, disintegration, and the formation of separate regimes. The country became increasingly unstable, and the people's livelihood became increasingly impoverished, leading to the current precarious situation where survival hangs by a thread, and bringing about the painful events of September 18th last year and January 28th this year. Who is responsible for this? Who caused this? For seventeen years, we have verbally talked about national humiliation and commemorated national humiliation, but national humiliation has increased day by day. Let us reflect on ourselves and ask how we will justify ourselves. Can our crimes of misleading and harming the country be forgiven by future generations?</p>
<p>The past is gone. What about today's affairs? We constantly chant about abolishing unequal treaties, but unequal treaties are likely to increase day by day. Therefore, today, if we are willing to be subjugated and exterminated, then so be it. If we are unwilling, then we should immediately make practical efforts and engage in practical struggles. We must put politics on track, revitalize and strengthen ourselves, to lay a new foundation for our country and cope with the crisis of the future world situation.</p>
<p>The future can still be pursued. Compatriots, let us rise up together and make plans. Our commemoration of May Ninth today should not be for cowardly tears, nor for timid sighs, but for the roar of the awakened sleeping lion, and for a resolute and heroic struggle.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Agreed Copy Can Be Signed Today <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The English version of the ceasefire agreement has been signed. However, the Chinese and Japanese versions of the copy still need to be modified in terms of wording.

It is understood that our side's instructions have arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, and the Japanese side has also received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It may be possible to sign today.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Troops Successively Withdraw from the Front Lines <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Kunshan, May 8th Electric Dispatch: The Japanese troops in Huangdu and Anting have begun to withdraw on May 7th. In the Nanxiang and Zhenru areas, our side sent 300 armed police officers from Zhenjiang to Kunshan on the morning of the 8th to take over defense and maintain public order in the areas where the Japanese troops had withdrawn.

At the same time, a large number of troops from Jia Ding, about several thousand, also concentrated in Luo Dian. Since the road was inconvenient for marching, they returned to Liuhe that night until 3:00 AM yesterday. Those who were unaware suspected it was a troop transfer. It was later learned that they used about 50 to 60 gasoline boats, each holding about 30 people, to transport them in batches to the mouth of the Liuhe River, where they boarded warships to go ashore in Wusong and other places. Currently, only the regimental headquarters camp remains in Niang Niang Temple in Liuhe Town, waiting for our Public Security Bureau to take over.</p>

<p>Nanjing, May 8th Electric Dispatch: The Takeover Committee for the Withdrawal Area believes that since the Japanese troops on the front lines have begun to withdraw, our side must be responsible for maintaining public order in the remaining areas. The first batch of security police officers transferred from Beiping will not arrive in Pukou until the 10th. Therefore, in order to exercise police power, there is no time to lose.

<h3 id="e10">Actively Planning to Repair Roads and Resume Traffic <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Takeover Committee Notifies Yesterday: The Takeover Committee believed that since the Japanese troops had begun to withdraw, traffic on the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Songhu (Shanghai-Wusong) lines should be resumed as soon as possible. Therefore, it informed the two Railway Bureaus yesterday, requesting them to send employees to repair the routes. The committee also sent a letter to the headquarters of the 19th Route Army for reference.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Negotiates Return: The two Railway Bureaus believed that it was urgent to resume traffic, so they sent a letter to the Takeover Committee yesterday afternoon, requesting that it forward to the Joint Committee to negotiate with the Japanese side to schedule the return of the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Songhu (Shanghai-Wusong) stations, factories, material factories, wharves, and other items so that repairs and traffic resumption could be carried out as soon as possible. After receiving the letter, the Takeover Committee sent the above situation to the Chinese members of the Joint Committee to contact the Japanese side for handling.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Sends Personnel to Suzhou: Chen also believed that the resumption of traffic on the two lines was being actively carried out in Shanghai and Wusong. The damage to the roads in Kunshan and other places was also severe. He specially appointed Secretary Ding Zhenheng yesterday to go to Suzhou to discuss everything with the headquarters of the 19th Route Army and to inspect the road conditions in the Suzhou-Kunshan area. Ding is scheduled to go to Suzhou this morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Xinghan Speaks: According to Chen Xinghan, Director of the two Railway Bureaus, Shanghai is close to the capital, so traffic on the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Road is particularly important. Since the January 28th war, the Songhu (Shanghai-Wusong) and Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) lines were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, resulting in the interruption of traffic between Nanjing and Shanghai, which caused inconvenience to all sectors. Therefore, since the beginning of the ceasefire conference, this bureau has been preparing for the resumption of Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) traffic. Only because the two armies on the front lines were still facing each other and had not ceased hostile actions, it was not possible to engage in repair work in practice. Now that the ceasefire agreement has been formally signed and the government takeover committee has been established, this bureau will immediately order the vehicle, engineering, machinery, and material departments to prepare to repair the bridges, tracks, and platforms along the road. As for the steps for the repair project, they can be roughly divided into several points: (1) Clearing obstacles on the road during wartime; (2) Repairing bridges and tracks; (3) Repairing platforms; (4) Trial run. After the above work is completed, traffic can be restored as usual. As for the date of resumption, it depends on when the Japanese troops withdraw from the road. If the Japanese troops withdraw completely, traffic can be restored within a week after the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Seeks Office Space: The two Railway Bureaus are located in key locations. During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the bureau was the focus of Japanese artillery fire, resulting in the destruction of all buildings. This time, in preparation for traffic resumption, Director Chen has decided to temporarily speed up the repair of the platform and ticket office for application. As for the office address of the Railway Bureau, it is also planned to find a suitable building near the boundary road and move in first.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Japanese Soldiers Stab Chinese People <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately Spotted by American Soldiers</p>
<p>Sent to the Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>Recounts the Cause of the Misfortune</p>
<p>The Continental Times reported that yesterday (7th) afternoon, a small worker at a construction site in Zhabei, because he did not understand the language of the Japanese Marines, fled in panic, and was immediately chased and beaten by the soldier, and stabbed in the chest with a bayonet. Afterwards, the Japanese soldier saw that the small worker was bleeding too much and was unconscious and dying, so he ordered other small workers to carry him away. The small workers then carried him over the Tokyo Road Bridge and placed him on the roadside of the public concession by the river. Fortunately, he was seen by American Marines who immediately notified the Putu Road Police Station, and a fire brigade ambulance came and sent him to Baolong Hospital. At that time, the small worker was still bleeding profusely and was in critical condition. Although he has been wrapped up and treated, the opportunity for recovery is still slim. When he was conscious, he recounted the cause of the misfortune. According to him, because the Japanese Marines called to him, and one soldier made a threatening gesture with a bayonet, he did not understand Japanese and was afraid of being beaten, so he ran away, and the Japanese soldier chased him from behind and stabbed him with a bayonet, searched his whole body, and then beat him violently. Last night, the reporter inquired with the American military. According to a certain officer, the American soldiers guarding the bridgehead and the riverbank did not witness the beating. It was only when he was carried over the Tokyo Road Bridge that they learned of the incident. It is now heard that the Putu Road Police Station is investigating the case. It is expected that the municipal government will protest to the Japanese side because the small worker was engaged in legal occupation, did not carry military weapons, and did not resist.</p>

<p>After the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement was signed, Japanese goods have been imported like a tide. According to an official of the Customs Import Department, cotton accounts for most of these Japanese goods, and the rest are groceries. In the past week, Mitsui Bussan has paid about 100,000 taels of silver in taxes. It is heard that all Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai's east and west have fully started operations, and the cotton is mostly supplied to the needs of the Japanese cotton mills.</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Municipal Area Pond Project's Stopgap Measures Require 250,000 Yuan <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Lin Kanghou and Others Plan to Ask the Financial Community for Advance Payments</p>
<p>Plan to Use Municipal Wharf Donations as Collateral</p>
<p>The municipal area pond project is related to millions of lives and trillions of properties. It was washed away last autumn and shelled this spring. If it is not properly organized, the autumn flood will be unimaginable. The provincial and municipal governments have therefore organized a pond project committee. After the second standing committee meeting, Du Yuesheng, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, and others were appointed as members of the committee to plan concrete ways to borrow money. According to the report of the Municipal Government Works Bureau, it is estimated that the repair cost requires 1 million yuan. It was submitted to the third standing committee meeting for discussion, and it was generally believed that the municipal area pond project requires 1 million yuan, and the provincial area is expected to double this number. In this way, the total amount of money needed will reach 3 million yuan. At this time of financial exhaustion, how can such a huge amount of money be raised? Then, Zhang Committee Member Gongquan and the pond protection committee put forward fundamental solutions, and the committee suggested that the provincial and municipal governments forward the report to the National Government for review and implementation. However, the pond situation is not immediately helpful, and the committee has organized a small group meeting to first plan stopgap measures. The small group meeting was convened on the 2nd of this month. After discussion, it was decided that the municipal area pond project should first raise 250,000 yuan for urgent stopgap measures. It was also decided that the matter should not be delayed, and we should actively consult with the Shanghai financial community to borrow money. The collateral for the loan is planned to be the most reliable wharf donation income of the municipal government. If the municipal government adopts it, the municipal government will inform the Tax Service by letter, and inform the bank designated by the loan group to directly allocate the principal and interest to the designated bank from the wharf donation item that the municipal government should receive every quarter. Every time the principal is due, it will be apportioned by the designated bank. The amount of this loan is 250,000 yuan, and the interest rate is planned to be weekly interest, and the repayment period is three months. If this is the case, it will be easy to raise money, and the pond project's stopgap measures can be carried out immediately. This plan has been notified to all parties concerned by the committee. Once passed, it can be implemented.</p>

<p>The autonomous surtax levied by the Shanghai County Government on the education funds of the tooth tax has expired for one year.

<p>Silk Merchants Are Unable to Purchase Cocoons</p>
<p>The spring silkworms in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and other areas of Zhejiang Province are about to enter their major sleep, and the lush leaves and new cocoons will soon be on the market. In previous years, at this time, cocoon merchants in various regions had already booked all the cocoons. This year, due to the sluggish silk market, which has reached its extreme point, the price of white silk has plummeted to 500 taels, and there are sellers but no buyers. Silk manufacturers have a large amount of silk in their hands that they cannot sell, and it is all mortgaged to the financial sector, with no funds to redeem it. Both the banking and money industries are extremely cautious about lending for cocoon purchases. Silk merchants with weak financial resources have no funds to purchase cocoons, and silk factories have made no preparations for purchasing spring cocoons.</p>

Therefore, we must seriously consider this. (2) Regarding the use of foreign capital, in light of past losses of sovereignty, the new plan must be corrected and based entirely on equality, mutual benefit, and the principle of not infringing on sovereignty. Foreigners have expressed dissatisfaction with this, but the Ministry will take a fair view and formulate a balanced approach in order to benefit both parties.

<h3 id="e85">Director of International Labour Bureau, Thomas, Passed Away Yesterday <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Havas Paris, 8th The former French cabinet minister and current Director of the International Labour Bureau, Thomas, was still talking with friends in a coffee shop near the Saint-Lazare station in Paris at midnight yesterday when he suddenly felt unwell, turned pale, and collapsed. He was taken to the Poing Hospital for examination, where he passed away after a short time. The Poing Hospital is also where President Doumer died.</p>
<p>Havas Paris, 7th Mr. Thomas, Director of the International Labour Bureau, graduated from the French École Normale Supérieure and was elected as a member of parliament several times, belonging to the Socialist Party. During the Great War, he served as Minister of Armaments. After the establishment of the International Labour Organization in Geneva, Thomas took charge of it. He was a skilled orator, excelled in administration, and worked tirelessly. He was a key figure in the Geneva International Organization and was particularly concerned about labour organizations. He travelled to the Far East several years ago to investigate labour conditions.</p>

<p>President of the Senate Lebrun is Promising</p>
<p>Second Vote Still in Progress</p>
<p>Unaffected by Assassination</p>
<p>National News Agency Paris, 7th For the position of successor President, Senate President Lebrun is the most promising. When the National Assembly meets at the Palace of Versailles on Tuesday to hold the election of the new President, Lebrun will serve as chairman. When the late President Doumer was elected as the national leader by the President of the Senate last May 13th, Lebrun succeeded to the position of Senate President. Lebrun was also a candidate for President last year, and is now supported by several factions of the Right, so his election is highly likely. Lebrun is 61 years old, has a distinguished political record, and has served as a cabinet member several times. Although he belongs to the Right, he is known for his stability. His profession, like that of the current President of the United States, is that of a mining engineer. When the National Assembly meets, members of the House of Representatives will still attend as old members, because although the new members will be elected tomorrow, they cannot be convened before the end of this week.</p>
<p>National News Agency Paris, 7th Today, due to respect for the late President Doumer, all political parties have announced a truce. Therefore, the scheduled campaign meetings for the evening have been suspended. Before the new President is elected, the position of head of state will be temporarily held by Prime Minister Tardiou, according to precedent.</p>
<p>Reuters Paris, 8th The second round of voting in the general election began at 8:00 a.m. this morning to elect 359 members of the House of Representatives. Although it is not as exciting as in the past, the number of voters is still large. The assassination will not have a significant impact on the general election. However, the public's demand for strict surveillance of foreigners entering France may cause the extreme left to lose many votes, as the public views the Communist Party as violent. Senate President Lebrun has agreed to be a candidate for President. Whether former Prime Minister Painlevé will be the candidate for President from the Left is still in doubt.</p>

<p>Little Political Motivation</p>
<p>-Statement of Goguloff's Wife-</p>
<p>Comintern Issues Statement</p>
<p>Opposes Individual Acts of Terror</p>
<p>Reuters Paris, 7th Goguloff was formally charged with murder this afternoon. The authorities will appoint a lawyer to defend him on Sunday. The Russian Ambassador to France visited the hospital yesterday to inquire about his condition and looked sorrowful upon leaving. He later sent a counselor to Prime Minister Tardiou to express condolences. The Russian counselor described the crime as an act of arrogance and baseness.</p>
<p>Havas Paris, 7th Regarding the character of the assassin Goguloff and the nature of the assassination, it is feared that accurate information may not be obtained in the near future. A supplementary report from the capital of Czechoslovakia proves that Goguloff had a very bad reputation among the Russian expatriates there. He was generally regarded as a political activist. Goguloff studied medicine in Rostov, Russia, in 1922, and completed his studies in the capital of Czechoslovakia in 1926. In 1927, he went to the Soviet Union and worked in the sanitation bureau of a certain area in the Kustanai province, using the alias "Chulkov" and belonging to the Communist Party. Later, he returned to Czechoslovakia and lived in the suburbs of the capital. He showed his Communist Party membership card to the local officials there. He once planned to go to France, but he did not because he started organizing the so-called "Pan-Russian Peasants' Party" in Czechoslovakia. The party he organized was actually just a new Bolshevik party.</p>
<p>National News Agency Paris, 7th The wife of Goguloff, the assassin of French President Doumer, was brought here from Monaco today. After six hours of continuous investigation at the police station, it was concluded that Goguloff's motive for the assassination was revenge for personal grievances, and that political motives were minor. After a long interrogation, Goguloff's wife denied that her husband had any signs of mental illness, but she said that he often expressed hatred for the French government because he had been expelled from France twice, and therefore harbored resentment. Coupled with his lack of intelligence, he was involved in politics, which was the motive for the murder. Goguloff's wife is Swiss. It is said that although Goguloff hated the Communist Party deeply, he was not a restorationist. He was stubborn and regarded national revival as his mission. He also made a great vow to save the world from communist trampling. The reason why his thinking was so stubborn was that he had been wounded in the head by shrapnel during the European War. Goguloff was still studying at a medical school in Moscow at the beginning of the European War. He immediately enlisted in the army and was discharged as disabled in 1917. He lived in Lapinskaga in the Caucasus Mountains. His father owned land, but after his father's death, the property was confiscated by the Soviet authorities, which made Goguloff hate the Communist Party even more. In 1921, his mother died, and Goguloff fled from Russia to Kurage and resumed his medical studies. He graduated from medical school and interned in a hospital. Later, he practiced medicine in Mahren via, and the situation was very good. The city belonged to Czechoslovakia, but Goguloff was forbidden to practice medicine because he did not join Czech nationality. Goguloff then went to France to practice medicine in Paris, but suffered various setbacks. Then he and his wife entered Monaco and settled down. Goguloff's life has been like this. He is rich in emotions and complex in thought, and he also prides himself on literature, writing two novels and a collection of poems, but readers say that they are very superficial.</p>
<p>Reuters Prague, 7th The Dean of the Obstetrics and Gynecology College here, Yeli, declared today that Goguloff obtained his medical degree through deception. Goguloff claimed that his father was a former officer of the Russian Imperial Guard and his mother was a nun. Goguloff often felt depressed in spring and summer and was examined by a neurologist. It is said that Goguloff often practiced shooting targets in his garden all night long.</p>
<p>TASS Moscow, 7th The Moscow newspapers today published a detailed biography of Goguloff, the assassin of French President Doumer, proving that he was an absolute hater of Bolshevism and opposed to the Soviet system. The newspapers also excerpted the constitution of the so-called "Green Party" (Pan-Russian Peasants' Party), which was signed by Goguloff as the leader and circulated abroad, indicating that the assassin was indeed a counter-revolutionary activist. It is said that some deliberately pointed out that Goguloff was a near-Bolshevik and engaged in agitation for the Third International, apparently to cover up his terrorist acts and use the assassination of this political figure to provoke disputes between the Soviet Union and other countries. The "Green Party Constitution" contains a declaration by Goguloff and others to Russian readers, denouncing the Soviet authorities as "Jewish assassins and bandits in the Soviet Union," saying that the only way out at present is to create a coup, a new revolution, kill all Soviet leaders, communists, assassins, robbers, enemies of workers and peasants, and hang all members of the Cheka (page 12 of the constitution). It also said that if the Soviet Union goes to war with Poland, Romania, China, etc., you should surrender to the enemy and become prisoners, because the enemy can clothe, feed, and protect you, which is a thousand times better than your communist and Cheka friends treat you. Without waiting for the war, quickly escape the country privately, kill your officers, carry your weapons, and say goodbye to Stalin forever (page 5). It also said, return all power to the non-party areas of Russia, and overthrow the Communist Party (page 12). After quoting the above paragraphs, the Moscow newspapers stated that the claim made by some that Goguloff's peasant party had a relationship with the Third International was a great farce. The newspaper then pointed out that after the assassin of the German embassy counselor, Stern, was executed, the White Russian Federation held a memorial meeting in Paris, and the speakers all praised the terrorist means of harming foreign political figures, calling it the only good way to fight against the Soviet Union. Also, the texts published by Kerensky in the Teni newspaper, issues 151 and 153, also praised Stern's terrorist acts in the same way.</p>
<p>Havas Paris, 7th The assassin of the French President was imprisoned at 9:00 p.m. last night and brought to court at 3:00 p.m. today. He was informed that the President had died and that his assassination of the President had changed from attempted murder to completed murder. Goguloff's wife was found in Monaco and voluntarily came to Paris to explain everything, but she said that she knew nothing about her husband's assassination plan. Goguloff had previously joined a certain faction and was slightly involved in an anarchist group, which attacked both the White and Red parties in the South Russia during the Russian civil war. After Goguloff fled Russia in 1921, he lived in Prague, Czechoslovakia, for a long time, studying medicine. His father was an officer of the former Russian Imperial Guard and later suffered from wind disease, and died paralyzed. His mother was a French nun. Goguloff had entered the Petersburg Army Primary School and often associated with nobles. The Russian Empress gave him a small diamond. During the European War, he was injured in the head in the Bukovina campaign. After the Russian Revolution, he first became a mason, then studied medicine at the University of Prague, Czechoslovakia. Because he did not obtain a degree, he could not practice medicine, so he went to Berlin to live, wanting to make a living by writing. He had written several books, including a small collection of poems. Goguloff said that in his works, he created a new literature of naturalism. He then planned to organize a "Pan-Russian Peasants' Party" and printed a plan, with only Goguloff as the member. His plan said that the way to save the world is only through war to demand Russia from the Russians, and promoting peace will be the end of Europe. Goguloff also said that he had invented special machinery that could defeat many enemies without suffering losses. Russian people in Prague said that Goguloff had intended to organize a green army to attack the Soviets from the Far East. Some factional newspapers seem not to believe the assassin's declaration. The monarchist newspaper of the Russian expatriates in Paris clearly acknowledged that Goguloff was a provocateur. The newspaper said that when Kutepov was kidnapped in Paris, a certain group was very much noticed by people at the time, and Goguloff had some relationship with this group. The royalist newspaper even said that Goguloff's assassination was related to the actions of the Koreans in Shanghai. The radical socialist newspaper strongly opposed the interpretation of the assassin's actions by the extreme right-wing newspapers and explained to the people that the assassin was only acting as a madman and had no meaning at all, while the extreme right-wing newspapers pointed out that it had political color. This statement contains a role and should not be taken lightly. The French Communist Party's newspaper also pointed out that the assassin was a provocateur, saying that Goguloff's actions were an anti-Soviet provocation.</p>
<p>TASS Moscow, 7th The newspapers here published a statement by the Comintern on the assassination of French President Doumer. The statement was signed by representatives of the Communist Parties of Germany, England, Russia, Czechoslovakia, France, Italy, and Japan. According to the Havas report, French Prime Minister Tardiou and his cabinet members held a meeting and issued an official document stating that the assassin of Doumer belonged to a "Pan-Russian Party with a near-Bolshevik nature" and was instructed by the Third International. The Executive Committee of the Comintern is deeply indignant at this rogue fabrication, believing that the intention of the fabricator is obviously to cover up the terrorist acts of the White Russians and blame the Comintern. The statement also said that Goguloff is a deadly enemy of communism, as evidenced by his writings and his confession, and the whole world knows that the Comintern is a group of international working classes that most resolutely oppose individual acts of terrorism.</p>

<p>British Court to Wear Mourning for a Week</p>
<p>Havas Paris, 7th President Doumer's remains are displayed in the Green Hall of the Presidential Palace. His family will go to guard the coffin from this afternoon. With a few exceptions, everyone can go to pay respects. The late president is wearing a formal dress, with a first-class medal of honor on the chest. The wound on the jaw is almost invisible because the wound has stopped bleeding and is covered with a small bandage, which is enough to conceal it. Crowds gathered outside the residence, and the police lined up to block them, so the order was not disturbed. Prime Minister Tardiou arrived at the Presidential Palace at 3:25 p.m. Madame Doumer immediately received him. Tardiou reported to her the State Council's resolution on the state funeral. All dignitaries came to the Presidential Palace to sign condolences. The President of the Russian Youth Royalist Federation, Kachinbek, personally presented a condolence letter from Grand Duke Andrew of Russia, expressing the condolences of the former Russian royal family. Foreign representatives such as Chinese Chargé d'affaires Xie Weilin and Japanese Ambassador Nagaoka, all sent condolences to the French Foreign Minister. The Soviet Russian Ambassador visited the hospital yesterday and was very moved when he left. This morning, the Counselor of the Soviet Russian Embassy declared to reporters after offering condolences, "This kind of atrocious and foolish crime, how can the Soviet Russian Ambassador express his opinion on such a matter?" Condolence telegrams from heads of state and prime ministers of various countries are pouring in. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Grandi, and US Secretary of State Stimson all sent private telegrams of condolence. The Italian government also ordered all public institutions to fly flags at half-mast to express mourning.</p>
<p>Reuters London, 7th The British Chamberlain issued a notice on black-edged paper today, stating that the British court will wear mourning for a week to mourn the murdered French President Doumer. When Doumer is buried, the British Emperor will send the Prince as his representative to France to hold the rope.</p>
<p>Havas Geneva, 7th Today, the meetings of all the groups of the Disarmament Conference Committee were suspended to express mourning for President Doumer. The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, sent telegrams to Tardiou in their personal names to express condolences. Newspapers all over the world unanimously expressed indignation at the news of Doumer's assassination and described the President's political career and his painful sacrifice for the country. Buerning sent a telegram of condolence on behalf of the German government. The whole of Germany flew flags at half-mast. When the news of Doumer's death was heard in London, the whole city mourned deeply. In addition to flying flags at half-mast, many hotels and banks in the city were surrounded by black gauze around the French flag. The public paid close attention to the attack, and everyone was talking about it in buses and subways. The churches also represented the faithful in expressing their deep sympathy.</p>
<p>Reuters Paris, 8th In the midst of the commotion after the assassination of President Doumer, a woman, dressed all in white, with an oriental physique and a solemn appearance, advanced among the startled men and women until she reached the former President, and knelt beside him, supporting his head with her arm, and used an embroidered towel to wipe the blood flowing from the wound. She was the daughter of an Annamese chieftain when Doumer was the Governor-General of Vietnam, and had always been protected by Doumer. It is said that Doumer's feelings for her were no different from those of a father to a daughter.</p>

The consulates that should be added are Dunhua, Tao'an, Jinzhou, Yimianpo, and Hailun; the branch offices are Ningguta and Fuyu. The expansion cost of the consulates in Manchuria is 1.5 million Japanese yen, and the expansion cost of the police in Manchuria is 5.8 million Japanese yen, totaling 8 million Japanese yen, which will be submitted to the extraordinary congress as a supplementary budget.

<p>Faith in Japanese Party Politics Gradually Lost</p>
<p>Nationalist Movement Rises</p>
<p>Denchu Agency Tokyo, 8th The Kanto General Assembly of the first local assembly of the Seiyukai was held at Yokohama Park at 1:00 p.m. today. Prime Minister Inukai, Home Minister Suzuki, and Takushoku Minister Qin arrived in Yokohama at 11:00 a.m. After lunch, 25,000 local party members welcomed them to attend. First, Representative Nogata delivered the opening speech, followed by President Inukai, who gave a speech on the policies that should be implemented in the future. Then Secretary-General Mori gave a speech and decided on the following declaration: "The current cabinet of our party is devoting all its efforts to measures to address economic and national crises. The administration of the previous cabinet for three years only destroyed the national economy, so it cannot be rescued in a day or two. However, the current cabinet has reconvened the extraordinary congress to deal with measures to address the financial world, restore the general economy, and stabilize the people's lives. This declaration is hereby declared."</p>
<p>Japanese Allied Tokyo, 8th Prime Minister Inukai spoke at the Kanto General Assembly of the Seiyukai today, discussing the issue of China, saying that the war in Shanghai in the past three months has completely ended with the establishment of a ceasefire negotiation, and peace in that area has also been restored. The issue afterwards is how to effectively maintain the order of the international city of Shanghai. The result of the Shanghai incident this time did not harm Japan's national rights, but realized international coordination. As for Manchuria and Mongolia, with the establishment of a new country, order is also being restored. We firmly believe that the results of the League of Nations investigation team's visit to Manchuria will prove that Japan's self-defense actions since last year are based on the right path and are moving towards an ideal world step by step. That is, Manchuria and Shanghai are both brewing new atmospheres after the disturbances, and there is no doubt that it will have a good impact on all aspects. However, we cannot be satisfied with this, because we must fundamentally establish a good-neighborly policy with neighboring countries in order to achieve lasting peace.</p>
<p>Denchu Agency Tokyo, 8th The Japanese people's faith in party politics can be said to have fallen to the ground. The national essence movement has risen in response to the stimulation of the Manchurian Incident and the general trend overseas. Therefore, the establishment of new parties by Katsuma Akamatsu, Masago Nakano, etc., who broke away from the Social Democratic Party, and the Kokuhonsha of Hiranuma men, etc., with the military as the background, have all become rapidly apparent. These parties echo parts of the Seiyukai and the Minseito, so each political party feels very embarrassed and is struggling to find a way to deal with it. That is, the government's and the party's special committee for the revision of the election law also has to resist the national essence movement. Miki Bukichi of the Minseito also has contact with them. Therefore, the existing parties have formed a common front to consolidate their own parties, so the political world will fall into a state of confusion.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Russia Vigorously Promotes Electrification <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency Moscow, 7th The All-Russian Electrification Congress opened here yesterday. The electrification program in the second five-year plan will be discussed in detail by famous electrical engineers and economists from all over the country under the leadership of the design committee Kupishev, and the methods will be determined next. It is expected that the country will generate 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity by 1937, reaching the target at the end of the planned second five-year plan. According to current Soviet Russian authorities, several large power plants have been decided to be built, one of which is located on the Angara River in Siberia. It is expected that the electricity generated by the plant by hydropower will be three times the electricity generated by the hydropower of the Dnieprostrova and Volgastrova plants on the Volga River, so as to develop the industry in Siberia. According to the major plan for electrification in Russia, the first was originally formulated by Lenin in 1921, with the expectation of completion in ten years, but by 1931, its development status had far exceeded Lenin's original expectations, and there has been rapid progress since the implementation of the five-year plan.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e98">Chen Jitang Unifies Naval and Air Force Power <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The First Army Group Headquarters Takes Over the Navy and Air Force</p>
<p>Guangzhou Special Dispatch - The brewing of the Southwest Government's reorganization and the Guangdong Provincial military authorities' prior takeover of the air force have been reported previously. The Guangdong air force was originally divided into the Zhongshan and Siyi factions. Chen Jitang of the First Army Group had already taken the Siyi faction into his own hands. Huang Guangrui, the first squadron leader's recent promotion to director of the aviation office, was a preparatory step to replace Zhang (Huichang). As a result, the Siyi (Taishan, Kaiping, etc.) faction's power has surged in the air force in recent years. Therefore, the authorities' sudden abolition of the Air Force General Headquarters and the removal of Zhang Huichang's position did not cause major internal problems. It is reported that after Huang Guangrui was ordered to serve as Air Force Commander, he immediately closed the old Air Force General Headquarters and reorganized the Air Force Headquarters, which is now directly under the First Army Group Headquarters. The Air Force Headquarters established by Huang Guangrui is slightly smaller in scale than before. The personnel for the various positions in the headquarters have also been internally determined, with Hu Jinya appointed as Chief of Staff, Guan Liuting as Chief Secretary, Hu Jixian as Director of the Military Affairs Department, Huang Qibin as Director of the Adjutant Department, Chen Xiu as Director of the Technical Department, Liu Zhiyan as Director of the Navigation Department, Yang Guanyu continuing to serve as Principal of the Aviation School, Zhang Zixuan as Commander of the Aviation Guard Regiment, Deng Yueming as Director of the Air Force Flying Training Team, Mei Long'an continuing to serve as Director of the Aircraft Factory, Tan Shou as Captain of the First Aircraft Squadron, Ding Jixu continuing as Captain of the Second Squadron, Zhou Bocheng as Captain of the Third Squadron, Xie Mang as Captain of the Fourth Squadron, and Wu Jianwen as Captain of the Fifth Squadron. Recently, it is also planned to establish a Sixth Squadron with six locally-made "Yangcheng" aircraft. After the First Army Group Headquarters resolved the air force issue, but because the leaders of the air force and navy had close relations on weekdays, Navy Commander Chen Ce hurriedly left the province for Hong Kong on the day the air force issue was resolved. The navy's offshore fleet, such as the Feiying, Zhongshan, Zhixin, and Yingrui, suddenly concentrated on Hainan Island, while the river defense ships, such as the Jiangong, Jianggu, Guanghua, and Long Jun, sailed to Tangjiawan. Only a few shallow-water vessels were moored in the provincial river. On the morning of the 2nd, important officials of the Navy General Headquarters did not go to the office. Chief of Staff Chen Ding and Marine Corps Commander Chen Qingyun had already gone to Hong Kong. Therefore, the First Army Group Headquarters decided to resolve the navy issue as well. It immediately ordered the Humen Fortress and the Changzhou Yuzhu Forts to use force to prevent the ships in the provincial river from exiting. On the 3rd, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government decided to abolish the Navy First Fleet Headquarters. The original navy was placed under the jurisdiction of the First Army Group, and Chen Ce was transferred to be a Senior Advisor to the First Army Group. (Note: On the same day, it was also decided to abolish the Air Force General Headquarters. The original air force was placed under the jurisdiction of the First Army Group, Zhang Huichang was transferred to be a Senior Advisor to the First Army Group, and Huang Guangrui was appointed as Acting Air Force Commander of the First Army Group.) Upon investigation, the navy's internal members had shared hardships with Chen Ce for a long time and were very united, unlike the air force's internal members, who were easier to divide. Therefore, after Chen Ce left his post, the ships acted freely. Even the four small ships moored in the provincial river, such as the Haihu, Guanggeng, Guangjin, and Anbei, rekindled their fires on the morning of the 3rd, wanting to sail out of Humen. The Humen Fortress used flags to stop them, but they did not listen, so they opened fire. The garrison troops were then dispatched on armed ships to intercept them. The four ships, facing the fortress's strong defense, returned to the river near Huangpu. The captain of the Guangjin was detained. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the First Army Group Headquarters sent Navy veteran Zhao Guizhang to recover the Guangjin. The rest were not obtained. On the evening of the 3rd, faint gunfire was heard, suggesting that they were still in a standoff. At four o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th, the First Army Group Headquarters sent Military Affairs Director Wen Zhongcheng to the Navy Headquarters to take over the documents. At that time, most of the old staff had already left. Chen Di came out to negotiate. Wen completed the takeover of the Navy Department that afternoon. (May 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Robbery on the Jinpu Railway <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - At three o'clock this morning, the Jinpu No. 9 train, traveling to a place three or four li north of Anlingzhen Station, suddenly a shot rang out on the train. More than ten bandits were discovered inside the train. One party boarded the locomotive and ordered the driver to stop the train. The other party confiscated the guns of the three security guards escorting the train (the three had a total of two guns). They then began to rob passengers of their money. The train was a slow train traveling between Tianjin and Jinan. Most of the passengers were poor and did not have much money. Even one yuan and eight jiao were completely searched. They did not take clothes. After about half an hour, the search was completed, and they got off the train, whistled, and left. The passengers on the train were greatly frightened. The train arrived in Jinan one hour late. According to people on the train, when the train arrived at Lianzhen, more than ten people bought tickets and boarded the train. The robbers were the people who boarded at Lianzhen. Later, the No. 201 Pingpu through train heard the alert when it arrived at Lianzhen. Because it was night, it did not dare to depart and waited until dawn before heading south. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Jinan at nine o'clock in the morning, but it did not arrive until 10:15, it is said.</p>

<p>Leading 120 Student Volunteers</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - Feng Yong, the president of Feng Yong University, after the Shanghai Incident, led the student volunteer army organized by the university to the front line of Liuhe to participate in the battle. Now that the Shanghai battle has stopped, he led 120 student volunteers from the university to take the Jinpu No. 2 train at ten o'clock this morning, passing through Jinan on his way back to Ping. The Jinpu Railway specially provided three carriages for free transportation. After arriving in Jinan, they immediately formed a team and got off the train, singing military songs. They went to the open space east of the platform to drill. They were all in yellow military uniforms, including seven female students, who were also fully armed, acting as vanguards, in shorts that exposed their knees, strong and powerful, and almost indistinguishable from men. According to Feng, the army suffered more than ten casualties while working on the front line. Today, there are a total of 120 people. When they arrived at the front line, they first patrolled the Liuhe area, and then went to Changshu, Kunshan, and Suzhou to direct soldiers to dig trenches. Recently, because the war has stopped and a peace conference is about to be held, the army is returning to Ping for training. He will still return to the front line in the coming days. When asked how he felt about leading the volunteer army to participate in the battle this time, Feng said that he felt that China's current situation is still unable to cooperate. The government and the people still cannot understand each other. If this continues, he fears that there will be a second and third Shanghai Incident in the future. If we do not seek unity, not only will Japan invade, but other countries will also follow suit. He hopes that the whole country will wake up, quickly seek cooperation, and jointly resist foreign aggression. The lessons of the Jinan May 3rd Massacre are a good example. He especially hopes that everyone will pay attention and do their best to promote it so that the public understands the current national crisis and rises up to become strong. Now, the Shanghai public and student representatives have injured Guo Taiqi, which is said to be because he signed a treaty that lost rights and humiliated the country. However, he said that such actions are inevitably too superficial. He also said that some of his team members are still staying in Taicang and Kunshan. Feng asked about the situation in Shandong and whether Chairman Han was in Jinan. The reporter replied that the area was peaceful and Han was in Jinan. At 9:45, Feng led the army to board the train and headed north on the original train at 10 o'clock. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Situation in Fujian After the Communists Invaded Zhangzhou <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - Various associations and organizations in the capital of Fujian Province, due to the rampant banditry in the province, recently sent Wu Huqin as a representative to Guangdong to discuss with the provincial military authorities the dispatch of troops to Fujian to suppress the spread. The reporter, considering the dangerous situation of the banditry in Fujian Province, visited Representative Wu yesterday to inquire about everything. He was kind enough to provide detailed information. Here is a summary of what Wu said:</p>
<p>The Communist Party's Intentions - During the large-scale campaign by the Guangdong army into Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, the bandits in that area fled from southern Jiangxi to Fujian. They then joined forces with the Fujian bandits and attacked Longyan. The purpose of this move was to seize Zhangzhou as a base, with the intention of invading Fuzhou and Xiamen to secure a sea route. Therefore, after capturing Longyan, they went straight to Zhangzhou. Their intention is obvious. Those who invaded Zhangzhou this time were the rebel army of Sun Lianzhong, Ji Zhendong's troops, and Luo Bingyao, Lin Biao, and You Ruixuan's troops under Peng Huaide, totaling more than 10,000 people. After occupying Zhangzhou, the bandits intended to attack Xiamen with all their strength. However, because Xiamen was heavily defended, they failed. They then turned to Tong'an to attack, intending to attack Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Defense and Suppression Situation - When the bandits attacked Longyan on the 10th of last month, the troops stationed there were Yang Fengnian's troops of the First Brigade under Zhang Zhen's 49th Division of the Fujian Defense Army. The brigade was suddenly besieged by the bandits, broke out of the encirclement, and retreated to Shizhong, and then to Nanjing and Zhangzhou. Because Nanjing had defenses and Zhangzhou was guarded by Wang Chengyun's troops of the Second Brigade under Zhang Zhen, the bandits' momentum, although fierce, was not easy to predict. However, because the divisions did not dare to engage the bandits, they retreated on their own, resulting in both places being occupied by the bandits. After Zhang Zhen withdrew from Zhangzhou, he retreated to Tong'an. The bandits have continued to advance towards Tong'an, and Tong'an is in imminent danger. As for Xiamen, the Zhangxia Garrison Commander Lin Guogeng is now leading the naval garrison troops to defend it closely, so there is probably no need to worry. Recently, Fang Shengtao of the Provincial Government, in order to plan for the suppression campaign due to the rampant banditry, rushed back to Fuzhou from Beijing. He then, together with Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet of the Navy, took the Chu You and Chu Tong ships to Xiamen to oversee the situation.</p>
<p>Current Situation in Fujian - After the bandits captured Longyan and continued to occupy Zhangzhou, Xiamen, because it is close to Zhangzhou, was in a state of panic and extreme shock. At present, because the defense is tight and the bandits cannot succeed, the situation in Xiamen seems to be slightly stable. However, the bandits have turned to attack Tong'an, and the situation is very critical. Chairman Fang, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered the troops stationed from Tong'an to Fuzhou to defend closely to prevent them from being infiltrated. At present, in addition to the Zhang Zhen Division stationed in Tong'an, Chen Guohui of the First Brigade of the Provincial Defense and He Xianzhu of the 8th Defense Zone Bandit Suppression Command are stationed in the Quanzhou, Yongchun, and Xinghua areas above Tong'an. In the Fuzhou provincial capital, the troops of the 56th National Defense Division Liu Heding, the troops of the First Brigade of the Marine Corps Yang Tingying, and the entire Second Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army Xiao Shuxuan are jointly defending. As for Yanping, Jianning, Shaowu, and other areas in northern Fujian, the troops of the 56th National Defense Division Liu Heding, the Provisional Second Division Lu Xingbang, and the Independent Brigade Zhou Zhiqun were originally stationed there and could provide support. However, due to traffic blockages, they can only defend themselves strictly at present. Commander Liu Heding, in order to consolidate the defense of that area, moved the headquarters of the 56th Division from Fuzhou to Yanping to facilitate command. At present, in addition to the strict defense by the stationed troops in various parts of Fujian Province, they are also urging Commander-in-Chief Chen to send a large army to Fujian to urgently attack Longyan from Shanghang and Yongding, so as to cut off the bandits' connection, making it easier to suppress them in one fell swoop and eliminate future troubles.

<h3 id="e102">Anhui Province Rushes to Build Provincial Highways <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Military Commission Sets a Deadline for the Completion of the Anhui-Zhejiang Road</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence - After the establishment of the new government in Anhui Province, it announced the policy of governing Anhui. In addition to pacification and financial management, it was to complete the provincial highways with all its strength. It was also resolved to use 600,000 yuan from the Anhui rice surtax as a special fund for road construction. However, recently, due to the small amount of rice exports, the income from the surtax is slow to meet the urgent needs. It was decided to use the rice surtax as collateral and borrow 600,000 yuan from Anhui merchants in Shanghai. Construction Director Cheng Zhenjun has gone to Shanghai to negotiate. This loan is specifically for the construction of the Tunxi-Changhua Road. This road can connect the traffic between Zhejiang and Anhui provinces and is related to military transportation. The Construction Department recently received a telegram from the Transportation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, stating that the long-distance bus route from Guangde via Xuancheng to Wuhu should be completed as soon as possible, as instructed by Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission, and the deadline should not exceed May. The provincial government immediately telegraphed the governments of Wuhu, Xuancheng, and Guangde counties to start raising funds and recruiting workers immediately, and appointed Duan Tianjue and Chen Jiarui as engineers and supervisors to supervise the construction in various counties. The total cost of labor and materials is about 300,000 yuan. It will take until the beginning of June at the earliest to complete the entire project. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Anhui Provincial Government Reaffirms the Opium Prohibition Order <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>But in Fact, Public Sale of Opium</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence - The opium disaster in Anhui Province has been poisoning the area for many years. The authorities have always used the excuse of "prohibiting opium through taxation," but the result has only increased opium poisoning, causing more harm. Sometimes they collect opium taxes on the one hand and strictly prohibit it on the other, which is self-contradictory, leaving the people at a loss. For example, in the winter of last year, when the Anhui Special Taxation Office was strictly collecting seedling taxes from various counties, the former Civil Affairs Director Liu Fu issued a vernacular announcement, strictly prohibiting planting. Currently, the southern and northern Anhui special taxation offices are still implementing the public sale of opium. The new Civil Affairs Director Luo Liangjian has also issued a strict opium prohibition order. The official rhetoric is contradictory as before. The full text of Luo Liangjian's instructions to the sixty counties of the province and the public security bureaus on land and water is recorded below to show a glimpse: "It has been found that opium prohibition is one of the important policies of the political training period. The Opium Prohibition Committee has repeatedly ordered us to follow the rules for the implementation of the opium prohibition law, and to investigate and prohibit planting, transportation, sale, and smoking separately. Since the beginning of my tenure, I have visited and investigated the opium prohibition situation in Anhui Province. It is inevitable that it is becoming increasingly lax. The county and bureau chiefs, who are in charge of the local area, have the special responsibility of prohibiting opium. If this continues for a long time, it will be difficult to excuse them for their negligence. Therefore, I hereby reaffirm the opium prohibition order. In the future, those responsible for opium prohibition must work hard to implement it in order to eradicate the accumulated poison. If there are still those who despise the law and fail to handle it effectively, or who are outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant and perfunctory, once discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law and will not be lenient. In addition to separate orders, it is hereby ordered that the county and bureau chiefs comply and order their subordinates to comply as well." However, it is not known whether this circular will be effective. (May 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Resolution of the Jinpu Railway Corruption Case <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Overweight Transportation of Bengbu Red Grain</p>
<p>Merchants Voluntarily Accept Punishment</p>
<p>The Jinpu Railway Northern Section staff recently discovered a suspected corruption case. According to the railway bureau's investigation, it was related to the overweight transportation of Bengbu red grain from Tianjin to Cangzhou and other stations. Upon discovering this, the railway bureau immediately ordered the transportation department to investigate the matter strictly. It summoned nineteen suspected employees to the bureau and, for the sake of caution, immediately organized a hearing committee to investigate thoroughly. On the one hand, it also sent additional personnel to investigate secretly. According to the results of the hearing and investigation, the overweight transportation of red grain this time was purely because small-scale merchants colluded with porters and the freight handlers of the transport company to secretly load it onto the train, hoping to transport it for free. The responsibility for the overweight is still borne by the company. Now the companies are voluntarily accepting punishment. The bureau believes that although the employees did not engage in corruption, they did not notice it at the time, and they are difficult to excuse for negligence in their duties. It is said that they have been punished according to the severity of their circumstances and have been instructed to supervise and strictly check the loading and transportation of goods in the future to prevent abuses. The bureau has also reported the occurrence and handling of this case to the Ministry of Railways.</p>

<p>Water Police Seize Boats Smuggling Rice - Jiangyin suffered a famine last year, and this year farmers in various villages are rioting and seizing rice. Since the Shanghai Incident, there have been unscrupulous merchants smuggling supplies to the enemy, often shipping them to Chongming to pass enemy ships. Several cases have been cracked down, but they were all vaguely dealt with leniently. Recently, a wealthy merchant in Wuxi has acted as a traitor, smuggling rice, exporting it through Changshu and Jiangyin, and colluding with powerful smugglers in the two counties. Changshu intercepted hundreds of dan and reported to the province for instructions, but no action has been taken. At Huangtiangang, Jiangyin, on the afternoon of the 3rd, Zhao Yunlin, a patrol officer of the 2nd Squadron of the Water Police, seized seven or eight hundred [units] of japonica rice. After inspection, it was reported to the county party department. According to the boatmen, it was purchased by Yufengtai Rice Store in Taixian and transported to Xichuan. There were a total of 2,500 shi. This was the first batch, and the rest will be shipped later. After being verified by the standing committee member Zhang Erjie's phone call to Magistrate Ma, and the business association's standing committee member Yin Zhaoyong held a certificate, they were released. According to the water police, in recent days, more than 4,000 shi of white rice, coarse rice, japonica rice, and indica rice have been exported through the port.</p>

<p>Change of Leader of the Salt Affairs Tax Police Team - Su Tiehan, the leader of the Huainan Salt Affairs Tax Police Brigade stationed in Tonghai, such as Rugao County, has been replaced by the Salt Affairs Audit Office and replaced by Shao Shaoying.</p>
<p>Soaring Rice Prices and the Opening of Affordable Rice Sales - Nantong's rice prices have recently soared, reaching 18 yuan per shi. The county government has requested the Food Management Committee to find ways to stabilize prices. In the four townships, there is a famine. Each district has opened affordable rice sales and distributed sweet potato chips to relieve the famine.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Cattle Dealers are Very Active - In the counties north of the Yangtze River, cattle dealers have recently been collecting cattle in large quantities and secretly exporting them through the small ports of Nantong. On the 7th, during the high tide at Xiaoligang, 34 cattle were intercepted at night. The cattle dealer Shan Bu'ao was sent to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<p>Robbery and Injury Case at Huanghualing - The county government, according to Guo Zhaoqi, the head of the 7th Autonomous District, reported that the families of Li Zhaogeng and Li Chunpeng, residents of three villages in Huanghualing, were attacked on the same day by more than 20 bandits who rushed into their gates, searched and looted everything, burned Li Chunpeng, and beat Li Zhaoguang and his two daughters-in-law, injuring four people. Two six-year-old boys from each family were taken away. He begged the county government to arrest the bandits and rescue the hostages. Because neither the plaintiff nor the public security bureau in charge had reported the matter, the county government ordered the public security bureau to investigate, fill out a form, and report it. At the same time, it instructed the police team to investigate and arrest the stolen goods and try to rescue the hostages.</p>

<p>Communists Rampant in Anhui - A large group of bandits suddenly occupied the place of Ma Gang in Xuyi County, Anhui Province, the other day. They burned, looted, and did whatever they wanted. All the pillboxes in Dongyang City were burned down. It is said that the bandits have now spread to Tianchang and Tongchengzhen, and are fighting fiercely with the Anhui Provincial Independent Regiment, the militia, and the defense forces of Tian and Xu counties. One company of the Independent Regiment was disarmed, and more than 20 members of the militia and the defense forces of Tian and Xu counties were killed or injured. The government forces were defeated and retreated to the encirclement. The situation is critical. It is reported that the communist leaders Qi Wanbei, Mei Yichong, Li Lianfang, and Zhang Baifei are directing the bandits internally. The villages they pass through are burned and killed. The residents of nearby villages have fled. It is said that the government forces have telegraphed the Anhui provincial government for help. Shen Qi, the captain of the 1st squadron of police stationed at the Ta'erji in this county, is afraid that the bandits will enter the borders of Gaoyou, and has come to the city to ask for instructions. It is said that Magistrate Li is planning to send heavy troops to defend the area.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob a Fishing Boat, One Person Dies - Zhu Chenglin and Ju Jinbang, fishermen from Minjiaqiao Town, north of the county, sold a boatload of fish in the Qingzhen Township of the 11th district the other day. The boat was moored at the Laoyata Wharf. Zhu Chenglin went to various villages to sell fish, but he met rain on the way and could not return to the boat, so he stayed at the home of his relative Yuan Baoxing. Ju Jinbang was guarding the fishing boat alone. Unexpectedly, at two o'clock in the night, two lake bandits suddenly came with broadswords and boarded the boat to search and loot. Because they found nothing, they tied up Chenglin with ropes and threw him into the river. The bandits then pushed the boat away. When Zhu Chenglin returned, he only saw Ju's corpse floating on the water. He is now planning to report the case to the city and ask the county government to arrest the bandits strictly.</p>

The division headquarters discovered this and sent teams to pursue them in different directions, and telegraphed the Provincial Security Department and the public security bureaus of various counties to intercept them. Eight deserters have now been killed and 36 captured, and 31 guns have been seized. The rest abandoned their weapons, disguised themselves, and fled. Yesterday, Division Commander Jiang Fusheng telegraphed Chairman Lu to seize them.</p>

<p>Methods for Relief of Flood Victims in Xubu - In addition to the Xubu flood relief association and the Red Swastika Society raising funds for relief, the Jinpu Garrison Command strictly ordered the administrative authorities to find ways to provide relief and send people away. However, during the spring famine, the number of flood victims is still increasing. Although there are flood relief associations, Red Swastika Societies, etc., that purchase and transport flour at affordable prices, and private individuals provide porridge and cakes for relief, most of the relief is concentrated in the urban area, and there is little regard for the countryside. A month ago, the flood relief association suggested lending money to help rural people with farming. County Magistrate Yang Weinong, Hu Yunqing of the flood relief association, and Xu Jianqing went to various districts to borrow money from wealthy households. It was stipulated that the loan for a large district would be 9,000 yuan, a medium district 8,000 yuan, and a small district 7,000 yuan. The total number of districts in the county is twelve. About 100,000 yuan has been raised in one week, which will be distributed to various districts. However, it is just a drop in the bucket and is difficult to benefit all the victims. Those who are thin and haggard still cannot disappear from the streets.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Two Committees for Silkworm Cocoon Industry Relief Officially Begin Work Today <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Registration of Old Factory Silk and Old Cocoons Limited to a Specific Time</p>
<p>Government First Allocates 2 Million Taels in Assistance Funds</p>
<p>Cocoon Prices Set to Protect Cocoon Merchants as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The Committee for Reorganizing Old Factory Silk and Old Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the Committee for Promoting Sales of Existing Factory Silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, officially begin work today, after the government appointed the committee members and announced the establishment. Registration of old silk and cocoons is limited to a specific time, and cocoon collection methods have been set. Details of the various items are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Official Operation　The Committee for Reorganizing Old Factory Silk and Old Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the Committee for Promoting Sales of Existing Factory Silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have set up offices on the third floor of No. 15, Museum Road. Yesterday, preparations were completed, and it was decided to officially begin work today, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Registration of old factory silk and old cocoons mortgaged by various factories will be handled starting today. The deadline for local areas is before May 15th, and the deadline for outside areas is before May 20th. Staff will be dispatched for inspection and weighing, and certificates will be issued.</p>
<p>Cocoon Collection Organization　The government has already allocated 2 million taels in subsidies for old factory silk and factory silk reeled from old cocoons. It is stipulated that a subsidy of 100 taels per shipment will be provided for the transportation and export of raw silk and that the raw silk export tax and the silk industry public debt fund surcharge will be suspended. As for the issue of cocoon collection this spring, organizations of silk and cocoon merchants and gentry from various regions will borrow money from silver shops and banks to handle cocoon collection matters. It has been decided to stop issuing 10 million yuan in cocoon collection exchange vouchers. It is reported that Shaoxing, Shengxian, Yuyao, Jiaxing, Haining, Huzhou, and other places in Zhejiang have already been organized. New cocoons will soon be on the market. Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places in Jiangsu are also actively preparing organizations because the arrival of their new cocoons will be slightly later than in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Cocoon Price Regulations　Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Department of Industry, and He Yushu, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Industry, have been in Shanghai for several days, discussing the new cocoon collection price with the two committees. If calculated according to the current silk price of 500 taels per picul, the cocoon price should be at least 350 taels, but the collection price is only around 20 yuan. In order to take into account the livelihood of farmers and the difficulties of silk factories, it has been decided to adopt a fair and equitable compromise. The price of improved varieties of cocoons will be as high as 35 yuan per picul and as low as 20 yuan. The price of Du varieties of cocoons will be as high as 25 yuan per picul and as low as 15 yuan. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will issue announcements to cocoon collection agencies in various regions to comply with this uniformly.</p>
<p>Government Protection　After cocoons are listed in various regions, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have decided to assume full responsibility for protecting cocoon collection and ensuring the smooth transportation of cocoons. They will also try their best to restore transportation. Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Department of Industry, took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train back to Hangzhou the day before yesterday. He Yushu, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Industry, is also scheduled to return to Zhenjiang by boat today. Both are actively preparing for protection matters. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the public security of cocoon collection this spring.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Former Acting Chairman of Hunan Province, Zhang Yipeng, Accused <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Of Owning a Large Sum of Money to a Hardware Store in Changsha</p>
<p>Using the Promise of Securing the Position of Chief of Public Security as Bait</p>
<p>Resulting in Neither the Position nor the Repayment of the Debt</p>
<p>The Son of the Creditor Files a Criminal Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng, a native of Hunan, was appointed as the acting chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China after the National Revolutionary Army marched north and recovered the two Hunan provinces. However, he still owed a large sum of money to the Baiji Hardware Store in Changsha from before. Wu Lishan, the manager of the store, believed that since Zhang had been appointed as the chairman, the old debt should naturally be repaid, so he went to demand payment. Zhang initially agreed to repay in installments, and then promised to introduce Wu to fill</p>
<p>The Position of Chief of Public Security in Hankou,　but the result was nothing more than empty promises. By the end of Zhang's term, he still had not received a single cent. Later, the owner of the store, Cheng Linpu, and Wu Lishan both passed away one after another. Zhang completely forgot about this debt. Recently, Cheng Daode, the son of Cheng Linpu, learned that Zhang had taken his family to Shanghai and was residing in room 124 of Jing'an Villa on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>Therefore, He Also Followed to Shanghai,　lodging at the Wanshun Inn at No. 15, Xin Kaihe Road. He then hired a lawyer to send a letter to Zhang demanding payment, but with no results. Therefore, he further hired lawyer Xi Yafu to file a private criminal lawsuit against Zhang Yipeng and his wife with the First Special District Court, requesting that they be punished for embezzlement and ordered to repay the money. The original complaint briefly stated that the plaintiff's late father, Cheng Linpu, opened the Baiji Hardware Store in Changsha. Between the 10th and 11th years of the Republic of China, the first defendant (i.e., Zhang Yipeng) contracted for the Hunan Mint and continuously obtained</p>
<p>Silver Advances from the Plaintiff's Late Father,　totaling 22,217.352 taels of silver according to the passbook and 20,251.972 taels of silver according to the vouchers. In September of the 11th year, the first defendant subcontracted the Hunan Mint to a Mr. Zhao and delivered 3,911 yuan in foreign currency (equivalent to 2,834 taels of silver) to the plaintiff's late father for the voucher. The remaining money was to be transferred by Mr. Zhao to the defendant for delivery. However, the first defendant delivered the money that should have been delivered to the second defendant (i.e., Zhang's wife),</p>
<p>Consuming the Money Completely　and refusing to hand it over. Later, Wu Lishan, the manager of the Baiji Hardware Store, repeatedly demanded payment, but he was always met with perfunctory responses. In the 16th year, the defendant served as the acting chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government. Manager Wu Lishan demanded payment several times, as the debt had been outstanding for a long time. The first and second defendants both agreed to repay in installments. However, the defendants were untrustworthy, on the one hand making empty promises and on the other hand even</p>
<p>Using Political Tactics　promising to introduce Manager Wu Lishan as the chief of the Hankou Public Security Bureau, in order to deal with him perfunctorily, resulting in the long-standing unresolved case. In the winter of that year, Manager Wu Lishan passed away due to illness, and the Baiji Hardware Store also suffered huge losses, resulting in its closure. The plaintiff's late father, Cheng Linpu, also died of anger. Now the defendant has fled to Shanghai and is hiding in the jurisdiction, so he has specially presented the defendant's embezzlement situation to the court, requesting that the defendant be arrested and punished according to Article 356 of the Criminal Law</p>
<p>With the Deserved Punishment,　and that the defendants be ordered to jointly repay the plaintiff the embezzled sum of 39,635.324 taels of silver, which would be a matter of public convenience. The case was heard yesterday by Qiao Wanxuan, a judge of the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Because the defendants Zhang Yipeng and his wife both failed to appear for questioning, it could not proceed. Judge Qiao then ordered a further summons for the defendants to appear for questioning.</p>

To restore the old situation, it is necessary to intensify the promotion of national goods. The standing committee resolved to hand it over to the Propaganda Department to design an expanded promotion and actively awaken the public to promote national goods. It is appropriate to agree in the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. However, mere empty words are of no help. It is now proposed to jointly organize a national goods exhibition with four national goods organizations in order to seek practical cooperation between production and consumption. A meeting of representatives from the four organizations will be convened at 2:00 PM on May 9th (Monday) to discuss the proceedings.

<p>The Xunxin Shipyard strike has been going on for several days. Qiu Peihao of the Social Affairs Bureau was dispatched to mediate. Yesterday, he, along with representatives of the shipyard's union, went to the shipyard to negotiate. The shipyard consistently insisted on paying only one day's wages for the strike period, while the union believed that the employer was deliberately being evasive and was very angry. After the Social Affairs Bureau tried hard to mediate, the union representatives complied with the mediation and expressed their willingness to compromise, but insisted on a minimum of half wages for the strike period. However, the employer consistently insisted on one day's wages, resulting in a stalemate with no results. Since the shipyard strike, various unions, such as the shipping, woodworking, ink making, pharmaceutical, and postal unions, have gone to express their condolences and offered considerable assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Three Business Employees' Congresses <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Presenting an Order from the Executive Yuan for the Municipal Government to Retract Its Mandate</p>
<p>All employees of the Commercial Press were very excited and demanded that the Reconstruction Committee of the Commercial Press Employees in Distress convene a congress to discuss countermeasures after learning that the Municipal Government had approved the dismissal conditions proposed by the employer. The committee presented a petition to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, ordering the Shanghai Municipal Government to retract its mandate (the petition is recorded below), and ordered all departments to convene member congresses. Yesterday (the 8th), the compilation department held a meeting at the Central Western Restaurant, attended by over a hundred members. Zhou Songjiu was elected as chairman and Zhu Tongzhou recorded the minutes. First, Zhu Gongchui and Chen Jiaxuan reported on the progress of negotiations, and Zhu Tongzhou reported on the economic situation of the meeting. Subsequently, the following resolutions were passed: (1) Continue the past spirit and fight to the end, vowing to achieve the goal of resuming work. (2) In addition to the original committee members, Zheng Xinnan and eight others were added as committee members. (3) The cost of the shelter will be borne by the Welfare Committee. Furthermore, the colleagues of the general affairs department of the library convened a member congress at the Sichuan Youth Association. Feng Yixian was chairman and Huang Deming was the recorder. First, Chen Dongwu, a standing committee member of the association, reported on the company's negotiations and the approval of the Social Affairs Bureau. The Welfare Committee was very willing to solicit the opinions of the members and sent a letter to the company, insisting on resuming work. Subsequently, Dong Yunting and Wang Shoukang reported on the shelter and the contact with lawyers Chen Qun and He Shizhen. It was unanimously advocated to persevere to the end and oppose dismissal. Later, Zhang Xinxiong and six others were added as directors. The printing department colleagues convened a meeting at the shelter, unanimously passing a resolution to insist on resuming work and petitioning the municipal government. It is reported that the colleagues of the distribution department also plan to convene a congress today to plan countermeasures together. The Commercial Press Employees' petition to the Executive Yuan is as follows: "Respectfully submit that the Commercial Press has deceived the authorities and dismissed employees, causing panic over unemployment and depriving workers of their interests. We appeal to order the Shanghai Municipal Government to retract its mandate in order to relieve the difficulties of workers and maintain the people's livelihood. The Commercial Press Shanghai Zhabei General Factory was destroyed by the violent Japanese army, and thousands of employees also suffered great disasters, living in poverty and displacement. For three months, Wang Yunwu, the director of the press, not only did not provide any relief after the incident, but also refused to return the compulsory savings that the employees had stored in the press. He intended to force the employees to accept and submit to harsh conditions through a scorched earth strategy. Recently, because the cunning plan failed, he again deceptively presented it to the Shanghai Municipal Government for approval of dismissal, placing thousands of employees who survived the disaster on the brink of despair. Such absurd measures are painful because the Shanghai Municipal Government disregards the true facts, legal agreements, and the suffering of the people, and is deceived by it. The press was founded with a capital of only a few thousand yuan. Through years of business expansion, shares have been added to shares, and the assets have now reached tens of millions. This incident was a national disaster, and there were some losses, but only half of the assets were lost. The government should find ways to maintain the press, but how can it exploit the sweat and blood of the employees who have made contributions to culture for decades to fill the gap? According to reason, how can this be considered fair? Moreover, the remaining property of the press is still more than double the amount. It is now actively engaged in restoration. The new Shanghai factory has been established, and the Beijing and Hong Kong branch factories have been greatly expanded. Dozens of branches are operating as usual. The proposed dismissal is even more unjustified. As for the regulations on retirement pay and severance pay, they are recorded in the company's treatment regulations and are observed by both labor and management. Now, under the situation of not being bankrupt, it wants to violate the law and reason, break the agreement, and take the opportunity to oppress, which is even more obvious. The Shanghai Municipal Government, based only on the one-sided words of the press, sacrifices the jobs of 4,000 employees, making them homeless, or even forcing them to take risks, which is not fortunate for the locality. The association is in this situation, not only feeling the great difficulties of the workers' lives in the future, but also worrying about social unrest, which will cause many hidden worries. Therefore, we appeal to your hospital to uphold justice, and to promptly order the Shanghai Municipal Government to retract its mandate for the press to deceive the authorities and dismiss employees without reason, in order to relieve the difficulties of workers and maintain the people's livelihood. We are sincerely waiting for orders. respectfully presented to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, Wang."</p>

Hankou Correspondence: The provincial schools and educational institutions in Hubei Province held a meeting at the Science Experiment Hall at 8:00 AM on the 6th to demand back pay and refuse the newly appointed Director of the Education Department, Shen Shiyuan. They decided to petition the provincial government. After the discussion, they marched in formation, led by Zhou Jingfang and Xia Zhizhong, to the provincial government. They submitted a petition to Chairman Xia. At the time, the provincial government was holding a routine meeting. The provincial committee members Kong Geng and Sun Sheng received them.

He replied to two points: (1) Director Shen was appointed by the central government. As subordinates, we must obey orders from above and cannot accommodate the representatives' request. However, it is also possible that Director Shen will not come due to your refusal. When the time comes to select a successor, we must determine a standard for suitability in order to request instructions from the central government. (2) The allocation of educational funds will be equal to all government agencies. The arrears will also be processed and distributed equally, without discrimination. The representatives deemed this satisfactory and left the provincial government, returning to the Science Experiment Hall to continue their discussions. Regarding the selection of a successor, they decided not to recommend anyone, but the person must meet the following conditions: (1) able to raise educational funds, (2) excellent in character and scholarship, (3) suitable for the position and the local situation, (4) impartial and selfless. They will submit a document to Chairman Xia to forward to the central government. The petition is as follows: "Submitting a petition regarding Shen Shiyuan, Director of the Hubei Education Department, who is deficient in knowledge, lacks experience, has a base character, and is unsuitable for the position. We earnestly request investigation and forwarding to the central government for swift dismissal and appointment of a capable person to maintain education. Hubei education has suffered repeated devastation and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Maintaining and saving it depends on a capable person. Recently, the provincial government was reorganized, and all aspects of governance were renewed. We hoped that education would be improved to meet the people's expectations. Unexpectedly, new appointments were made repeatedly (initially, Wang Shijie was appointed, but Wang declined; then Huang Jianzhong was appointed, but Huang also declined; finally, Shen Shiyuan was appointed). In fact, Shen Shiyuan, who is despised by the literati, was appointed to this important position. This is akin to replacing beams with inferior materials, causing great harm. We feel deeply concerned and dare not remain silent. Therefore, we have made repeated appeals and submitted numerous documents and telegrams. For the past ten days, we have been grateful for your consideration of the situation and your willingness to accommodate us. However, the central government does not understand the truth and has not changed its decision. We fear that the situation will not be communicated upwards and will cause future harm. We respectfully present the reasons for refusing Shen to you. Shen graduated from Waseda University in Japan, where he studied law, not education. He then served as the Director of General Affairs and part-time lecturer at Peking University. After the establishment of the National Government, he managed to obtain the position of Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, but was dismissed by Chairman Zhang for dereliction of duty within a few days. Currently, he is a secretary with simplified appointment at the Ministry of Education, but he has not actually reported for duty, only receiving a monthly salary and enjoying a leisurely life in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Therefore, he has no so-called knowledge or experience. Furthermore, Shen was a staff member at Peking University who repeatedly stirred up student movements, leading young students in factional and power struggles. The scar on his forehead remains to this day. Recently, in order to avoid reporting for duty, he has resorted to servile means to deceive Chairman Chiang and Minister Zhu, acting as a go-between in the hope of achieving his personal desires. Considering past events and observing recent situations, his base character is evident. We believe that Your Excellency, who respects your hometown and seeks to govern with diligence, should not allow such an unqualified person with no virtue or talent to fill the ranks. Moreover, Shen is in league with Huang Jianzhong, willingly acting as a puppet. How can we expect him to assist in provincial governance, improve education, and benefit our hometown? To prevent harm, action should be taken early. We respectfully implore Your Excellency, who has always been concerned about protecting education, to not allow this unqualified Shen Shiyuan to bring shame to the party and the country, and to poison the Jianghan region. Therefore, we dare to send representatives to meet with you and present our case in person. We earnestly request investigation and forwarding to the central government for swift dismissal of Shen Shiyuan from the position of Director of the Education Department, and the appointment of a capable person to maintain education. We are filled with anxiety and await your orders." (May 6) Zhejiang Province's Method for Subsidizing Education Expenses in Border Areas: Establishes Three Standards Based on Population and Region. Zhejiang Province believes that the people in the border counties are intellectually underdeveloped and have no understanding of the national situation or their own position. This situation is entirely due to the lack of popular education. Therefore, it has proposed a method for subsidizing education expenses in impoverished border areas, which will be implemented by the Finance and Education Departments after discussion. (1) The provincial government will make an overall plan to subsidize each county related to national defense with a certain amount of funding. (2) The subsidy standards will be divided into three categories based on population, area, and the level of educational development: Category 1: large population, large area, education expenses above 20,000 yuan; Category 2: large population, large area, education expenses above 30,000 yuan; Category 3: small population, small area, education expenses below 20,000 yuan. (3) The county administrative council will pass the plan and submit it to the provincial government for implementation. The Zhejiang Education Department Emphasizes Basic Education. Establishes Kindergarten Teacher Training School to Train Teachers. Counties and Cities Should Appropriately Establish Kindergartens. The Zhejiang Education Department believes that kindergarten education is the foundation of all education. If there is a lack of comprehensive facilities, it will have a significant impact on the future of education. It has been found that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has traditionally neglected kindergarten education. Few elementary schools in counties and cities have attached kindergartens. Even if they are established, there is a lack of qualified teachers. Therefore, it has been decided to establish a provincial kindergarten teacher training school in the 21st year to train kindergarten teachers, and to establish a model kindergarten and nursery to study the points that need to be improved in the existing kindergarten facilities, to regulate the standards for establishing kindergartens, and to urge the education bureaus of county and city governments to appropriately establish kindergartens and nurseries, in order to gradually promote this. Temporary Meeting of the Chinese Cooperative Society. Decides to Establish a Wholesale Agency Department. The Chinese Cooperative Society, recognizing the difficulties faced by cooperative societies in various regions, which are mostly due to the inconvenience of wholesale and the high prices charged by wholesalers, making it extremely difficult to develop business, and based on suggestions from the society to establish a wholesale agency department, which it also believes would greatly benefit cooperative societies in various regions, the executive committee members of the society, Chen Guofu, Zheng Shiying, and Chen Zhongming, drafted the articles of association. The fourth temporary meeting was held in Nanjing on the previous day to discuss the matter. The committee members present were Chen Guofu, She Jingtang, Wang Shiying, and Chen Zhongming. Chen Guofu chaired the meeting and Chen Zhongming recorded the minutes. After unanimous discussion, it was decided to revise and pass the proposed articles of association, and to send letters to cooperative societies in various regions to solicit opinions and actively prepare, in order to realize the establishment of the department as soon as possible. General Meeting of the Shanghai University Professors' Anti-Japanese Association. Re-elects Eleven Directors, Including Xie Xunchu. Issues Declaration Denying the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement. The Shanghai University Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, due to the dispersal of members after the Shanghai Incident and the de facto cessation of association activities, and with the reopening of schools and the increasingly dangerous national situation, convened a general meeting of all members yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Those present included Kang Xuanyi, Xie Xunchu, Shen Junru, Zhu Qinglai, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Yi, Wang Zhaoshi, Ni Zhengao, Lu Dingkui, and Xu Jiashi, totaling more than fifty people.

Finally, the following resolutions were passed: (1) Oppose civil war, (2) Declare denial of the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement, (3) Strive for the British Boxer Indemnity to restore education in Shanghai universities, (4) Initiate a public memorial service in Shanghai for anti-Japanese martyrs and those who died in the line of duty, (5) Draft a national educational policy for national salvation.

<p>Commercial News: Fluctuations in the Gold Market Over the Past Week. Unpredictable Weather. Inevitable Minor Reaction After Nine Consecutive Weeks of Gains. Last week, the gold market experienced drastic fluctuations, rising and falling, ultimately proving unstoppable. Dealers were disoriented, with twists and turns of several to more than ten taels, making it extremely difficult to predict. This was due to conflicting domestic and international news, with market conditions shifting accordingly. It coincided with the spring race season for Western merchants, so trading was only half a day in the morning, as usual. The market trended upward from the beginning of the week, opening at 733.5 taels and then surging past 740 taels. On Wednesday, a new price of 747.2 yuan was seen, due to repeated reports of shrinkage in British silver, while American silver remained stable. This led to an upward trend in exchange rates, resulting in tight Shanghai taels and stable US dollars. Dealers' hedging was varied, with gold prices fluctuating irregularly, and both bulls and bears controlling each other. Towards the weekend, a sudden storm broke out, breaking through 30 taels and suddenly falling to 24.5 taels, due to the spread of various unfavorable news for the gold market, which changed the atmosphere for the worse. This was actually due to the influence of the Guangbang Hengxing bulls emerging. However, the exchange rate was able to stabilize, so the closing price was set, amounting to 80 taels, compared to 60 to 70 taels at the beginning of the week. Currently, some banks are absorbing spot gold, but inventory is not excessive. It has been found that the high and low prices in this week's gold market differed by 22.7 taels, with a net decrease of 2.1 yuan, which is due to a minor correction after nine consecutive weeks of gains. Here is a summary of the overall situation of the week. A Recap of the Entire Process.

Yesterday was a Sunday, and although the money shops were open as usual, the banks were closed, and there was nothing to do. As a result, the market atmosphere was very brief. Foreign Li still fell, with the early market at 7 yuan and 02 Li half, and the noon market at 7 yuan and 02 Li and 2 Hao half. As a result, it fell another 6 Hao and 2 Hu half compared to the previous afternoon. Silver discount rose slightly by 1 Fen, calculated as 7 Fen. Auxiliary coins also generally declined. Jiangnan Xiaoyang was 6 yuan, 1 Fen, and 4 Li in the early market, and 6 yuan, 1 Fen, and 3 Li in the noon market. Although there was a difference of 1 Li between the two markets, it had fallen by as much as 4 Li compared to the early market on the previous day. Transactions were 4,000 corners in the early market and 1,500 corners in the noon market. Guangdong Xiaoyang was 6 yuan and 01 Li in the early market, a slight increase of 2 Hao half compared to the noon market on the previous day. The noon market was the same price.

Bond Market for the Week After the Securities Exchange Resumed Operations: Prices Stable and Fluctuations Peaceful. Turnover Only Over 14 Million. Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai and the suspension of operations of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, three months have passed in an instant. Although there have been repeated rumors of resumption of operations, they have ultimately not been realized due to military relations. It was not until the end of last month that the Ministry of Finance issued instructions, approving the opening of the market at the beginning of last week. Because the surrounding situation has improved and the Sino-Japanese issue in Shanghai has been resolved, the market is optimistic. Although large investors are still in a wait-and-see state, scattered investments are not deserted. Bond prices have generally trended upward. On Monday, except for the two types of consolidated six customs duties, all other types have risen to the limit and trading has been suspended. On Tuesday, there was a report of continued trading being suspended due to troop reduction. Although there were still increases, the fluctuations have been largely peaceful. However, since then, the market supply and demand situation has been flat, and although prices have fluctuated, the trend has gradually become sluggish, with no major changes in daily trading. However, it should be noted that the bond price increases and trading suspensions last week refer to the book prices on January 25. Compared to the off-market prices at the end of last month, the fluctuations are very small. Compared to January, the actual increase is very large, excluding accrued principal and interest. Internal troop reduction has almost increased by 10 yuan, and other good types have increased by about 5 or 6 yuan. Judging from the current situation of the bond market, unless there are new changes in the surrounding situation, there will not be major increases or decreases in the short term, and the future may be sluggish. In terms of bond market trading, spot transactions are not deserted. Total turnover for the week reached 574,200 yuan, including 99,500 yuan for 19 Customs, 89,000 yuan each for salt tax, unified tax, and 20 Customs, and 670,000 yuan each for troop retrenchment and 20 Customs. Other types were only around 1 million yuan. Although 96 and financial products were issued, the amount was very small. There were also not many transactions for June futures. The high and low fluctuations and transaction amounts of various bonds over the past week are listed below. (Unit: yuan. In addition, the price increases and decreases of the bonds listed in the table below were not included because there was no reliable basis for comparison.)

Cotton yarn prices continued to trend downward last week, due to unstable conditions, inconvenient transportation, and tight finances. In addition, last year's severe floods caused significant damage to all parties, and now the Shanghai war has broken out again, tightening the money supply. The economic situation in the interior is particularly difficult, with a significant lack of purchasing power. As a result, business is extremely sluggish, leading to a gradual increase in factory inventories. The goods of the Wuxi Yarn Factory have been transported to Shanghai in order to find a way out. The yarn from the Zhengzhou Yarn Factory is also being sold in Shanghai, which shows the difficulty of selling yarn in all directions. As a result, prices have continued to decline. The standard yarn for yarn and cloth trading officially resumed on Monday, with the standard changed to 20s "Ren Zhong," which is one grade higher than before, but the price was very low, only 155.3 taels. It coincided with a major slump in American cotton, and rumors of war were rampant. Those outside the industry viewed the surrounding environment as harsh and unanimously tended to sell off. The market gradually declined. The lowest price on Thursday was 150 taels. At the weekend, due to the official signing of the Sino-Japanese Peace Ceasefire Agreement, sentiment was shaken, and the situation rebounded strongly. The total transaction volume of standard yarn for the week was 53,000 bales. The current yarn purchased by various groups was estimated at 4,371 bales. The prices of 32s and 42s fell by 6-7 taels, and the prices of 16s and 20s fell by 2-3 taels. Shenxin sometimes opened for business. The amount purchased by each group and the high and low prices of the standard yarn are listed below.

<h3 id="e122">Yesterday's News on the Workers' Strike at the "Shishi Xinbao" <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Since the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper in Shanghai dismissed all of its workers under the pretext of the "Da Wanbao" newspaper printing incident, a labor-capital dispute has arisen. The situation has been reported in various newspapers. For over a month, despite mediators' efforts, the matter remains unresolved due to the newspaper's lack of sincerity. The union, fearing that the public is not fully aware of the case, has issued a statement to clarify where the responsibility lies. The workers forced to leave the newspaper have also started fundraising. Here are the reports from yesterday:</p>
<p>Forced Workers Start Fundraising: After being dismissed by the management, all workers of the newspaper, while waiting for the union to actively negotiate with the management, have organized a publicity and fundraising team to fight to the end. It is reported that in recent days, they have already raised 100 yuan from Mr. Sun Ke, 20 yuan from Ms. He Xiangning, and 20 yuan from Mr. Ma Chaojun. These gentlemen have also expressed their deep sympathy and offered words of comfort.</p>
<p>Statement by Spokesperson of the Newspaper Industry Union: It has been over a month since the labor dispute at the newspaper began. The losses suffered by both labor and management are substantial. Upon detailed analysis, the responsibility for this loss should be borne by the newspaper. As the Japanese invaders encroach and the national crisis intensifies, all those with breath and spirit are filled with grief and anger, united against the enemy. How could we, the labor force, rise up and make demands from domestic capital during this time of crisis? The labor force, whose vision and knowledge are typically considered immature, has such insight during this time of national crisis. Yet the capital, whose vision and knowledge far surpass that of the labor force, especially the capital of newspapers staffed by intellectuals, should have even greater patriotic vision during this national crisis, setting an example for the masses and fulfilling the duty of our press. The "Shishi Xinbao" management, during this national crisis, unreasonably refused to allow workers who have served the newspaper for many years and made no prior demands to work. One wonders what their intentions are. The workers who were refused work are in a situation where, on one hand, their homes in the war zone have been destroyed, leaving them with nowhere to settle. On the other hand, they are being forced into unemployment, leaving their future livelihood without guarantee. Unable to bear it, they have started fundraising from all sectors of society and detailing the various vicious tactics of the newspaper's management, so that the public can understand the truth. This kind of work can be described as the arduous and remarkable work of our newspaper workers. The "Shishi Xinbao" usually uses editorials to advocate for relieving unemployment and guiding society. Furthermore, when the tensions of the Battle of Shanghai were high, they did not hesitate to sacrifice newspaper space to publish job advertisements for free to help those displaced by the war. On the surface, the public praised them for this. One would think that with such a compassionate newspaper, the Chinese nation would not perish. Little did people know that the newspaper's management was taking advantage of the national crisis to hire unemployed workers at low prices and reduce the workload of its existing employees to achieve the goal of suppressing workers and undermining the union. Our newspaper workers have finally realized the true nature of the newspaper's management's actions: their so-called relief for unemployment and leadership of society are nothing more than hypocritical and despicable tactics to deceive themselves and others. As for the cause of this labor dispute, the facts are very clear and need no further elaboration. Therefore, the responsibility for the loss should be borne by the management.</p>

<p>Yu Yongyuan, a sixteen-year-old boy from Jinhua, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou with his mother a few days ago. Unexpectedly, he lost his way and became separated from his mother, leaving him with nowhere to go. As he wandered the streets, Hu Zhenbiao, a twenty-two-year-old man from Zhenjiang who lives in a small hotel in the French Concession, saw that Yu Yongyuan was young and easily deceived. He invited Yu to join the army, but Yu refused. Hu Zhenbiao insisted on taking Yu Yongyuan to Zhenjiang. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, they quarreled and fought on Xinqiao Street. A police officer, Yang Zhengtu, saw them and, considering Hu's private recruitment of soldiers a violation of the ban, took them both to the First Precinct of the Second District for questioning. After Director Xu interrogated them and confirmed the details, a military certificate from the 9th Division of the Army and a badge of a transport officer, Ma Zhigui, were found on Hu. Neither belonged to Hu, clearly indicating illegal recruitment. He was sentenced to be handed over to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>An old woman, Zhang Chen, is sixty-eight years old and has only one son, Zhang Ren, who is twenty-seven years old. He used to be a carpenter, is married, and has two sons, one of whom has already died, and the other is four years old. Zhang Ren was spoiled by his parents from a young age, leading to a lazy nature. He has been unemployed for several years and is deeply addicted to opium, which is destroying the family fortune. Since his father's death, he has sold off most of the family property, and the family is without food. As a result, his wife relies on her parents' family for food, and his old mother works as a helper for the wealthy to make a living. Only Zhang Ren is alone and unrepentant, wandering aimlessly and indulging in opium dens. Thus, in this chilling weather, he wears only thin, short clothes and has exhausted all his resources. Instead of embracing a positive outlook, he has turned to a negative path and committed suicide by drowning the day before yesterday. Yesterday, his body floated to the shore. The seventh district local security officer recovered the body and identified it. Zhang Chen went to identify the body and confirmed that it was her son. She immediately petitioned the local court for an exemption from autopsy and requested a free coffin because she could not afford one. After preliminary examination by Prosecutor Xie, the request for exemption from autopsy was granted, and a note was issued to the Charity Hall to request a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Most of the Saigon cinnamon used in Chinese medicine is not produced domestically and relies on imports from North and South America. However, it is mostly transshipped from Japan to China for sale, with the Japanese reaping the profits.

Now, the Chinese merchant Hanli Company (located at No. 467 Jiangxi Road, opposite the Water Pavilion) has recognized this situation and directly purchases and transports it from overseas, reselling it to medicine merchants in various regions to meet demand. This is truly an important undertaking in the movement to resist foreign goods. Moreover, the quality of the goods is pure, and the prices are fair, which is especially commendable.</p>
