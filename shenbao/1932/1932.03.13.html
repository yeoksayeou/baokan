<h3 id="c1">救濟上海敎育問題彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>一二八禍變爆發。上海頓淪爲砲火連天之戰塲。在慘酷之破壞與迫害之下。商離其肆工失其業。皆陷於停頓。而其最鉅大至於無可補償之損失。則尤推敎會</p>
<p>上海邇年學校林立。敎育頗爲發達。　且以商業中心而兼文化中心。此次禍變突發。而學校區域之吳淞江灣眞茹又適爲戰地。在日軍砲大轟炸之下。經多年慘淡經營之同濟大學。中國公學。復旦大學勞働大學曁南大學。持志學院中央大學醫學院。商學院上海法學院。水產學校商船學校。等或全部被燬。或菁華盡喪。即幸獲完整者。亦無法開學。其他中學小學。更復不少。直至目前。除曁南大學勞働大學中國公學持志學院上海法學院等三數校。巳遷地設法開學而外大多數學校。仍陷於停頓狀態。各地靑年因而失學者。爲數正不知若干。此種敎育上之損失實至足令吾人痛心。</p>
<p>吾人認爲此種現象。絶不容延長。此種損失絕不容增鉅。負有敎育之重責者。應亟以創造不精神從事恢復。如其不能則亦亟應另覓校舍。另遷善地。如各國立大學此時正宜遷往南京就各部院寛敝之房屋借用籌備開學俾靑年不至長時陷於失學之悲境。</p>
<p>至於各私立大學。吾人則尤望其能趁此時機。以合作之精神。集中力量。　辦一大規模之大學。蓋過去大學。雖林林總。總蔚爲大覩。但大都設備不同。規模狹隘。人力財力。兩感不敷。彼校旣附設一商科。而此處則又專設一商學院。彼校旣附設一法科而此處則又專設一法學院。性質旣同。而以力量分散。收效極微。何如破除門戶之見。通力合作。各盡其力。創辦一大規模之大學。此不僅爲嘉惠靑年而巳。其於敎育與文化前途裨益尤大</p>
<p>吾人認爲上海爲商業之中心。習旣奢靡。尤尙虚華此種環境。久不宜於心性未定之靑年。換言之。即上海根本不宜建設爲文化之中心。吾人切盼各學校趁此時機。遷往内地。不必麕集於此繁華奢靡之商埠。以養成多數　縱虚浮之靑年。</p>
<p>至我政府。在此時期吾人亦深盻其毌忘却此一嚴重問題。或託言非常時期。以財政困難。此問題無法談到。敎育爲立國之大本。敎育破產國家之前途。乃眞不堪設想。今日我國家整個敎育。以敎育方針之不確立。救育行政之紊亂敎育經費之扣發。實際巳瀕於破產。固不止上海一隅而巳。再不力謀挽救。我國今後。果尙有敎育之可言耶。</p>

<p>日方又有三種新條件</p>
<p>但中國方面表示反對</p>
<p>上海停戰會議、日使重光、以未明瞭中國覆文二點、前日並未到會、以致會議未成、昨日亦未開會、惟聞日政府又有三條件、而中國外部、初未聞悉、且亦未接到日方關於此事之來件、則日方此項條件、是否宣傳作用、抑或試探性質、實未悉其眞意所在茲姑將外報所記者、譯誌如次、</p>
<h3 id="c10">日方又有三種條件大美 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>晚報云、據美聯社十一日東京電稱、日政府巳電命華日使重光葵暫緩在滬召集圓桌會議、以待中國表明關於談判之意志星期四夜、中國當局致日使之公文、聲明中國須俟日本立即完全撤退上海區域内之日軍、始能參與圓桌會議、日政府雖重行聲明在開始休戰談判中、不欲提出任何政治條件、但經考慮之後、决計不依從中國所提出立即撤兵之主張、日政府現堅持三種條件、㈠禁止華軍開入日軍退出之區域、㈡規定一時期、在此時期中、須觀察華軍之行動㈢决定日軍退出區域内之警務問題、</p>
<p>日文日日新聞云、關於中日停戰交涉、中國方面、巳於昨夜（十日）答覆受諾該答覆書中、要求日軍即時無條件完全撤兵、我政府（日本）協議結果日本撤兵上海、雖不附政治的條件、惟關於㈠撤兵區域内中國軍之不許侵入、㈡對於中國軍之行動、監視期間之設定問題㈢撤兵區域内之警備問題等三項、因中國方面仍主張反對、故須先判明中國方面之意思後、再開公式會議業、巳訓令重光公使遵照、</p>

<p>晚報云、今晨（十二日）中國當局聲稱、如美聯社之電果確、則和平堪稱業巳絕望、蓋中國曾一再聲明、日軍退至一月二十八日之原陣線、不得附有條件也、目下日使重光葵與郭次長仍假手英使蓋溥森互換意見、非俟兩國意見較爲接近、則和會不致實現、聞日使重光葵巳將中國對三月四日國聯决議案應享之權能、請示於日政府、俟接覆電後、當正式宣佈其依照國聯决議案進行談判之態度、故今日（十二）下午和平談判或有切實之變化也</p>

<p>報代表今晨曾謁見中國外交部某要員、據稱、中日會議之進行、並非如外間誤傳之圓桌會議性質、蓋該會純爲停止敵對行動及協定日軍撤退辦法而舉行者也、該員竭力反對日本所提出禁止華軍開入日軍退出之區域一條謂中國巳切實宣</p>

<p>在總理逝世紀念會上之報告</p>
<p>對日應有抵抗之决心與方法</p>
<p>不能以空洞誇大之論調誤事</p>
<p>（南京）十二日爲總理逝世七週年紀念、中央黨部留京辦事處於上午九時在中央黨部大禮堂舉行紀念會、到中委居正·汪兆銘·陳璧君·蔣中正·顧孟餘·褚民誼·陳銘樞·程天放·陳布雷·張道藩等、曁各機關代表中央黨部全體職員、共五百餘人由居正主席、領導行禮後、由汪兆銘演講紀念意義、略謂自十四年總理逝世、每年今日、我們都有無限悲痛和感想、尤其在今天正是國難當前之際、使我們覺得加倍不安、加倍沉痛、我們知道世界上無論那一個國家、都會有國難的因爲現在的世界、不是講公理而是講强權的時候、總理的遺敎、就是想使中國能夠脫離國難、現在日本對國際聯盟調查團說中國自國民黨執政以後、日趨排外、實則總理的遺敎、只是救中國之自由平等、中國之求自由平等、對於東亞和平世界大同、都是有益處的、然而此種意義、爲什麽不爲鄰國所了解呢、爲什麽日本還說我們排外呢、這完全是因爲日本不要中國得自由平等、因爲中國得了自由平等、則日本即不能遂其侵略的野心由民國成立後、而有二十一條之要求、和慘痛的濟南慘案兩事、就足見日本之用心了所以大家要明白中國現在的國難、是因爲求自由平等而來的、但我們並不因爲有國難、就不求自由平等我們是要排除國難的、我們今天紀念總理、必要把總理所預料的國難設法打破、纔不愧爲總理的信徒、我們對於日本的侵略、要堅决抵抗、但是抵抗的意義、必要明瞭、現在常常聽見一種話說、對付日本、非强硬不可、如果黨内有人主張不强硬、則這個人一定被犧牲、如果國民黨不强硬、則國民黨也一定要打倒、我們對此話、根本上不能贊成、我們應該把内政和外交、分析淸楚斷不能以外交爲内政的工具、如果以强硬的政策、來博取黨内的信用、國民的信用、這是完全錯誤的、從前的專制君主、遇到國内困難的時候、就會以對外間題來轉移國内目標、即使國富兵强、能立威於國外、也是罪惡何况現在我們對方的國家、比我們富强得多、如何可以國家爲孤注呢、故此將强硬的政策來維持一人或、黨的政權是根本不應該做的、如果這樣、便把决心抵抗的意義弄錯了、民國三年、袁世凱簽字於二十一條共解釋是中國打不過日本、所以暫且忍辱負重、因此遂種了現在國難的禍根、設使當日袁世凱能决心抵抗、也許山東東北及沿江沿海一帶會被日本佔領、但到了歐戰以後、則中國便有復興的機會了、華盛頓會議之時、如果中國没有簽字於二十一條、則我們所得、决不止如九國條約、可惜袁氏苟且偷安、失却了中國復興的機會、而且種下今日的惡果、所以自從去年九月十八日到現在、我們絕對不肯簽字於喪權辱國的條約、這完全是爲中國將來的前途而定的政策、這就是我們抵抗的意義、至於抵抗的方法、惟有遵照總理的遺敎來切實進行、現在有些流行的口號和標語、如「殺到東京去、如果」是總理的信徒、就决不會有這樣誇大的說話、日本是一個海軍國試問我們有没有相當的海軍可以殺到東京去呢、這完全是表示我們没有知道自己　力量、也没有知道敵人的力量、這是極危險的、我們應知自己在物質上不如日本但是下了决心、不爲暴力所屈當盡所有的力量、來和日本抵抗明白了這般意義、方纔能想出抵抗的方法、又如所謂『全國總動員、』這句話在日本是可以說的因爲日本是徵兵制、所以遇到戰爭、便可以全國總動員至於我們還是募兵制、調來調去、不過是現有的軍隊「總動員」三個字、是用不着的我們今日所需要的、是全國防衛預備人人抵抗處處抵抗、使日本侵略行動、無所往而不遇着阻碍、這纔是由抵抗的、意義而生出抵抗的方法、此外還有一種空空洞洞的催戰論、也足以誤事的、我們因而想起明朝末年的景象來、彼時滿洲起於東北、流寇起於西北、朝野上下的所謂愛國、便是一種空空洞洞的催戰論無論、對於當國、的人及帶兵的人、皆不許其審度情勢有進退疾徐的可能、必使之不由自主的隨着催的論調盲目前進、我們試一檢閱當時的諭旨奏疏、及所謂輿論淸議處處都可以湧現出此一種情形、其結果怎麽樣、有良心有熱血的人、便可一死報國没良心没熱血的人便只有投降、詩經說得好、人之云亡、邦國殄瘁等到有良心有熱血的人死完了、國便也隨之而亡了、我們現在明知在物質上種種條件都不如日本但我們决不爲日本暴力所屈、必盡所有的力量來和日、本抵抗、但我們還要知彼知巳、善用所長善藏所短而不可有虚驕意氣、總而言之、我們要根據抵抗的意義來想出抵抗的方法、我們知道總理的遺敎、是敎我們明白抵抗的方法、我們知道總理的遺敎、是敎我們明白世界大勢、誇大的說話、輕率的舉動是人他所絕不容許的我們應付現時的國難只有長期抵抗、而所謂抵抗要有抵抗的决心、還要有抵抗的方法有决心而没有力法、則中國可以致亡、有决心而並有方法則中國一定能在危中得安亡中求存、現在我們在總理逝世紀念當中雖然是有無限的悲、痛但是從悲痛之中生出勇敢、我們以堅定的决心適宜的方法沉着奮鬥我們相信中國的國難一定可以打破總理的遺敎一定可以實現、（十二日專電）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Rescuing the Shanghai Education Problem <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The January 28th Incident erupted, and Shanghai was instantly plunged into a battlefield of relentless artillery fire. Amidst the brutal destruction and persecution, businesses were abandoned, and workers lost their jobs, everything grinding to a halt. However, the most immense and irreparable loss was undoubtedly suffered by education.</p>
<p>Shanghai had seen a proliferation of schools in recent years, and education had flourished. Moreover, as a commercial center, it was also a cultural hub. The sudden outbreak of this incident and the fact that the school districts of Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhenru were precisely the battle zones meant that, under the massive bombardment by Japanese forces, Tongji University, China Public School, Fudan University, Labor University, Jinan University, Chi Chih College, Central University Medical College, Business College, Shanghai Law College, Fisheries School, Merchant Marine School, and others, which had been painstakingly developed over many years, were either completely destroyed or had their essence eradicated. Even those that luckily remained intact were unable to open. A considerable number of other middle and primary schools were also affected. As of now, except for a few schools like Jinan University, Labor University, China Public School, Chi Chih College, and Shanghai Law College, which have relocated and managed to resume classes, the majority of schools remain suspended. The number of young people who have lost access to education in various places is unknown. This kind of educational loss is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>We believe that this situation should not be prolonged, and this loss should not be amplified. Those who bear the heavy responsibility of education should urgently dedicate themselves to recovery with a spirit of creation. If they cannot, they should quickly find alternative school buildings and relocate to better locations. For example, national universities should seize this opportunity to move to Nanjing and borrow spacious buildings from various ministries to prepare for reopening, so that young people do not remain in the tragic state of being out of school for an extended period.</p>
<p>As for private universities, we especially hope that they can take advantage of this opportunity, with a spirit of cooperation, to concentrate their efforts and establish a large-scale university. Although there were numerous universities in the past, they could not be considered significant overall. Most had different facilities and were limited in scale, with both human and financial resources falling short. If one school already has a business department, another establishes a dedicated business college. If one school already has a law department, another establishes a dedicated law college. Since the nature is the same, yet the resources are scattered, the effect is minimal. Why not break down sectarian barriers, cooperate wholeheartedly, each doing their best, and establish a large-scale university? This would not only benefit young people but would also greatly contribute to the future of education and culture.</p>
<p>We believe that Shanghai, as a commercial center, is inherently extravagant and values superficiality. This environment is not suitable for young people whose character has not yet been formed. In other words, Shanghai is fundamentally unsuitable for becoming a cultural center. We earnestly hope that all schools take advantage of this opportunity to move inland, avoiding the concentration in this bustling and luxurious commercial port, in order to cultivate a large number of non-superficial young people.</p>
<p>As for our government, during this period, we also deeply hope that it will not forget this serious problem or make excuses about the extraordinary times and financial difficulties, claiming that this problem cannot be addressed. Education is the foundation of a nation. The bankruptcy of education will lead to unimaginable consequences for the nation's future. Today, our nation's entire education system, due to the lack of established educational policies, the chaos in educational administration, and the withholding of educational funding, is actually on the verge of bankruptcy. This is not limited to Shanghai alone. If we do not strive to remedy this, what education can our country speak of in the future?</p>
<h3 id="e2">League of Nations Assembly Passes Resolution <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Unanimously Approved by Forty-Five Nations</p>
<p>Representatives of China and Japan Did Not Vote</p>
<p>A Special Committee Will Be Formed Thereafter</p>
<p>U.S. Government Expresses Satisfaction with the Resolution</p>
<p>British Newspaper Says Victory Due to Small Nations' Struggle</p>
<p>Tokyo Claims Japan Wants Speedy Resolution of Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly formally passed a resolution today. Neither China nor Japan voted. The gist of the resolution is as follows: both parties agree to fulfill their treaties, abide by the League of Nations Charter, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the resolutions previously passed by the League of Nations, and agree to submit their dispute to peaceful resolution. The resolution details the previous resolutions passed, including the resolution passed by the Assembly on March 4. The Assembly's previous resolution requested both the Chinese and Japanese governments to immediately find ways to implement a ceasefire and advocated that China and Japan, with the assistance of neutral countries, begin negotiations to effectively end the war and arrange for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The other points of this resolution are as follows: emphasizing Article 10 of the Charter, regarding the provision prohibiting the destruction of territorial and political integrity, maintaining the dignity of treaties, disapproving of the boycott against Japan, and the Assembly Committee engaging in mediation efforts to achieve a cessation of war and the actual withdrawal of Japanese troops. After the aforementioned conditions are fulfilled, a round table conference will be held. The Assembly Committee must be involved in the entire issue of the dispute between China and Japan. Today, 45 countries voted in favor of this resolution, with no dissent. This resolution was first considered at a meeting of the General Committee. During the consideration, much attention was paid to the Manchurian aspect of this dispute. The Japanese representative, Sato, read out a telegram regarding the situation of the Shanghai negotiations and repeatedly stated that the Japanese troops in the Shanghai area would withdraw once hostilities had effectively ceased and appropriate measures had been implemented to prevent the recurrence of the war and to ensure the neutrality of the withdrawal area. Sato also stated that Japan fully agreed with the principles of this resolution and especially welcomed the statement of respect for treaties, but due to slightly different opinions regarding the application of Article 15 of the Charter, he was instructed not to vote. Japan, as a member state of the League of Nations and a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, had no territorial ambitions towards other member states of the League of Nations and only deemed military action necessary because its people and their property in China were in danger. The Chinese chief delegate, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, did not speak. After the General Committee passed this resolution, neither the Chinese nor Japanese representatives voted. The Assembly then transformed into a plenary session, and Chairman Hymans formally put this resolution to a vote. As a result, the resolution passed with no dissenting votes. The Chinese and Japanese representatives still did not vote. Dr. Yen explained that his reason for not speaking was purely because he had not received instructions from the Chinese government, but his abstention was by no means a sign of opposition. After this resolution was passed, the Assembly used a secret ballot to elect six members who were not members of the Administrative Council, together with Chairman Hymans and the twelve members of the Administrative Council, to form a special committee to replace the Assembly in handling matters. The members elected were: Switzerland (38 votes), Czechoslovakia (35 votes), Colombia (31 votes), Portugal (26 votes), Hungary (24 votes), and Sweden (24 votes). At the close of the session, Chairman Hymans stated that the Assembly had completed its first duty, which was to organize a committee to carry out its work in fully implementing the Assembly's responsibility. He also requested that both parties provide various assistance to realize the hopes derived from this resolution. The Assembly then adjourned until convened by the Chairman at another time. The content of this resolution has been notified to the U.S. representative here, and the United States has been requested to cooperate if necessary to maintain order in the Shanghai withdrawal area. It is expected that the United States will agree. Today, Dr. Yen sent a letter to the League of Nations Secretariat protesting the Japanese consul's order to the customs commissioner of Antung to hand over the customs office to the so-called new government of Manchuria and stated that the League of Nations' investigation team had arrived in the three northeastern provinces slightly late, so Japan was taking advantage of the opportunity. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the election of the nineteen-member committee was completed, the chairman declared that the Assembly had fulfilled its preliminary obligations, but the committee's task was very difficult. It should reconcile and ease the claims of both parties and assist the League of Nations' cause. To consolidate the League of Nations' strength depends on the reconciliation of both parties. Our only thought is to respect the rule of law, and we hope that both parties will take action to meet the expectations of the Assembly and the world. At this point, he announced that the Assembly would adjourn until the next time it was convened. The nineteen-member committee will convene at the beginning of next week.

<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson expressed satisfaction today with the resolution passed by the League of Nations Assembly and said that the peaceful purpose expressed by the Assembly's current actions is the same purpose contained in the Pact of Paris and the League of Nations Charter, which should be supported by all countries in the world. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government authorities today received news from Geneva that the League of Nations Assembly, in the resolution it passed, clearly recorded other peaceful instruments besides the League of Nations Charter itself and recognized these peaceful instruments outside the League of Nations Charter as a basis for efforts in the process of mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute. Therefore, the U.S. political circles welcomed it. They felt that the League of Nations General Committee's expansion of the scope of the resolution could be regarded as the League of Nations' expression of approval and support for the principles repeatedly stated by U.S. Secretary of State Stimson. What is especially gratifying is that it is reported that the proposal to mention the Paris Peace Pact specifically in the League of Nations Assembly resolution was initiated by the British chief delegate, Sir Simon. President Hoover himself firmly believes that the path currently taken by the League of Nations is the most effective way to resolve the Far Eastern dispute. Therefore, Washington is quite optimistic about the future progress of the work in Geneva. (National News Agency dispatch of the 11th)</p>

<p>London The London morning newspapers are silent on the possible impact of the League of Nations resolution and do not say a word. Only the Chronicle breaks the silence and says that the only serious judgment of the masses on the resolution is that it came too late. The newspaper said that this resolution is a full and effective condemnation of Japan's actions, and what is especially noteworthy is that there were no dissenting votes. The newspaper also said that the resolution does not approve of taking responsibility for controlling Japan's policies. This is something the League of Nations will never dare to do, and even dare not say too much. The basic principles of the League of Nations, trampled upon and in imminent danger, depended on the struggle of the small countries among the members to win the victory.

It is also heard that Elder Statesman Prince Saionji will meet with the Japanese Emperor on March 14 to present the policies that should be adopted in the future towards Manchuria and Shanghai.

<p>(Tokyo) There is another clear proof that Japan is eager to quickly resolve the Shanghai incident. It is heard that the authorities have decided to reduce the number of ships in the Third Fleet, which was specially formed on February 2, and then lift the fleet's mobilization. Moreover, the troops of the Hirozaki Division and the remaining troops of a certain division who will be sent to Manchuria will only have one brigade per division, except for the division headquarters. Therefore, it is not to increase the troops assisting Manchuria, but only to replace the two brigades of the Korean Division. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)</p>

<p>Director Fan of the 19th Route Army's Shanghai Office received a telegram from Staff Officer Yang Jizhang yesterday morning as follows: (1) This (10th) afternoon, the enemy set fire to four places in Jiading City, and it is still burning fiercely, the situation is extremely tragic. (2) After the enemy at Ludu Bridge was repelled by our army, the enemy increased by more than a thousand men in the morning (9th), but no fighting has occurred yet. Today (10th), the front line is quite quiet, with only slight contact between sentries. Specially reported, your subordinate Yang Jizhang, knocking on the ashes of the frontier,</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Kunshan on the 12th stated that British Counselor Stuart Bothwell, accompanied by Staff Officer Yang Bolun dispatched by the General Headquarters, went to the front line to inspect on the 12th morning and returned to Nanjing that night. Liu Zhennian sent personnel to Kunshan to offer condolences and to investigate the front line.</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Suzhou on the 12th stated that at Shen Yue Wang and the east Xing Bridge in the city on the 12th, more than 300 enemies landed and pressed more than 40 civilians into service. The residents fled in panic. The enemy took the civilians toward the pontoon bridge. Several Japanese ships arrived at Yanglinkou on the 12th, carrying more than a thousand enemies who landed. One part advanced towards Loutang, and another part went towards the pontoon bridge. Japanese ships were moored at Yanglin.</p>
<h3 id="e9">No Ceasefire Meeting Held Yesterday <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Side Has Three New Conditions</p>
<p>But the Chinese Side Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>The Shanghai ceasefire meeting did not take place the day before because Japanese Minister Shigemitsu had not clarified two points in the Chinese reply. The meeting was also not held yesterday. However, it is heard that the Japanese government has three new conditions, but the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not heard of them and has not received any correspondence from the Japanese side regarding this matter. Therefore, it is not known whether these conditions from the Japanese side are for propaganda purposes or of a probing nature. The following is a translation of what was reported by the foreign press:</p>
<h3 id="e10">Japanese Side Has Three New Conditions <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported, citing an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 11th, that the Japanese government had telegraphed Japanese Minister to China Shigemitsu Aoi to postpone the convening of a round table conference in Shanghai to await China's expression of its will regarding negotiations. In a document sent by the Chinese authorities to the Japanese Minister on Thursday night, China stated that it could only participate in the round table conference after Japan immediately and completely withdrew its troops from the Shanghai area. Although the Japanese government reiterated that it did not want to put forward any political conditions in the start of ceasefire negotiations, after consideration, it decided not to comply with China's proposal for immediate troop withdrawal. The Japanese government now insists on three conditions: (1) prohibiting Chinese troops from entering the areas withdrawn by Japanese troops; (2) stipulating a period of time during which the actions of Chinese troops must be observed; (3) deciding on the police affairs in the areas withdrawn by Japanese troops.</p>
<p>The Japanese-language Nichinichi Shimbun reported that regarding the Sino-Japanese ceasefire negotiations, the Chinese side had replied and accepted last night (10th). In the reply, the Chinese side demanded that Japanese troops be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally. As a result of discussions, our government (Japan) agreed to withdraw Japanese troops from Shanghai, although without political conditions. However, regarding (1) the prohibition of Chinese troops from entering the withdrawal area, (2) the setting of a monitoring period for the actions of Chinese troops, and (3) the policing of the withdrawal area, because the Chinese side still insisted on opposing them, it is necessary to first determine the intention of the Chinese side before holding a formal meeting. Minister Shigemitsu has already been instructed to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Peace Negotiations May Change <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that this morning (12th), the Chinese authorities stated that if the Associated Press dispatch is true, then peace can be said to be hopeless, because China has repeatedly stated that Japanese troops should withdraw to the original front lines of January 28 without conditions. Currently, Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi and Vice Minister Kuo Chi-tao are still exchanging opinions through British Minister Gower, and the peace conference will not be held until the opinions of the two countries are closer. It is heard that Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi has asked the Japanese government for instructions on the powers that China should enjoy under the League of Nations resolution of March 4. After receiving a reply, he will formally announce his attitude of conducting negotiations in accordance with the League of Nations resolution. Therefore, there may be substantial changes in the peace negotiations this afternoon (12th).</p>
<h3 id="e12">China Clarifies the Nature of the Meeting <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Da Mei Evening News visited a certain official of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning. According to the official, the progress of the Sino-Japanese meeting is not the nature of a round table conference as misunderstood by the outside world, but is purely held to cease hostilities and agree on methods for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The official strongly opposed Japan's proposal to prohibit Chinese troops from entering the areas withdrawn by Japanese troops, saying that China had earnestly declared its best efforts to stop and avoid hostilities. When Japanese troops withdraw, the Chinese authorities will order Chinese troops to remain at the current defense line to avoid causing conflict. As for the request to prohibit Chinese troops from entering the withdrawal area, it is not something the Japanese government should be concerned about. The official also opposed the Japanese troops turning the withdrawn land into a neutral zone, saying that although the land was occupied by Japanese troops, China had not surrendered or abandoned its sovereignty and land rights. Everyone now knows that no peace conference is being held here. The current negotiations are only exchanging opinions through the diplomatic representatives of third countries, and a formal meeting cannot be held until the opinions of both sides are closer. The Da Mei Evening News then showed the Associated Press's Tokyo telegram. The official replied that the National Government insisted that Japanese troops should withdraw unconditionally. If this telegram is true, then the Shanghai incident may have no hope of peaceful resolution, and it shows that Japan has no sincerity in the current negotiations.</p>

<p>Did Not Discuss Shanghai Incident with Matsuoka</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kuo Tai-chi issued the following statement regarding the report in today's (12th) The Times that he had discussed the Shanghai incident with Mr. Matsuoka: "Today (12th), the Shanghai The Times published a Japanese news stating that I (Kuo said himself) and Mr. Matsuoka, representative of Inukai Tsuyoshi, are still continuing to discuss the Shanghai incident, but the results are still unknown. Since Mr. Matsuoka's arrival in Shanghai, I have never met him. The above news is very surprising. I hereby make a special statement to avoid misunderstandings."</p>

<p>If the Japanese Side Has No Sincerity</p>
<p>Resistance Must Continue</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Kunshan on the 12th stated that this morning the reporter visited General Tsai and asked for his opinion on the ceasefire meeting. He replied that if the Japanese side negotiates without conditions, our side can attend, but the only goal is always to not disgrace the country or lose an inch of land. Otherwise, our side will never accept it. However, I do not know if the Japanese side has abandoned its aggressive ambitions. I am afraid that the Japanese side will use this period to make further plans. For example, the Japanese side has recently learned that the League of Nations investigation team is coming and is urgently withdrawing the front-line troops in the hope of concealing the facts. On the one hand, it is still continuing to increase the three regiments. This proves that the Japanese side's ambitions have not ended. If the peace conference is obstructed and the Japanese army still invades us, then our army will do its best for the country and the people, in accordance with its original intention, and continue to resist to the end. The government also has complete preparations, so do not be resentful.</p>

<p>A special dispatch from Kunshan on the 12th stated that the Japanese side withdrew its troops from Huangdu, Ludu Bridge, Fubridge Town, Yanglin, and Qiya on the 11th afternoon in an attempt to cover up the eyes and ears of the League of Nations investigation team and shirk responsibility.</p>

<p>Leave Some at Discretion and Withdraw Most</p>
<p>Still Have the Freedom to Send Troops to Shanghai</p>
<p>An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 11th stated that it is heard that the Japanese Army Ministry has decided to withdraw most of the Japanese troops from Shanghai, but some must still be left at discretion. It is said that the military department believes that since the Chinese troops have withdrawn to the distance required by Ueda, the original intention of sending troops has been achieved, so there is no need to station a large army again. It is also heard that when the withdrawal of troops begins, a declaration will be issued stating that if the situation in Shanghai becomes tense again, Japan has the full freedom to send troops to the troubled areas. A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 12th stated that according to unconfirmed reports, the Army Ministry is now preparing to begin withdrawing part of the Japanese troops from Shanghai without waiting for the outcome of the round table conference. The Japanese side said that the purpose of sending troops to Shanghai has been achieved, so it is withdrawing some of them.</p>
<p>The Japanese-language newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported that our military authorities, because the purpose of the Shanghai dispatch army has been slightly achieved, from the free position of the military department, intend to withdraw troops on their own initiative, except for leaving some troops at discretion, but it is stated that if the situation in Shanghai changes again after the withdrawal of troops, it will still have the freedom to dispatch troops again.</p>

<p>A Total of Seven or Eight Thousand Arrived Within Two Days</p>
<p>Large numbers of Japanese soldiers continue to arrive. While the Japanese army is promoting a ceasefire, it is still actively deploying troops to Shanghai. From the 10th to yesterday afternoon, the Japanese reinforcements that continued to be transported to Shanghai totaled another seven or eight thousand, all of whom were regular army soldiers. They were loaded onto transport ships such as the France Maru, Azumayama Maru, and Niibari Maru and landed at Wusong and Yangshupu, totaling 3,7800 men. More than 2,000 soldiers were also transported to Shanghai via the Kogiku Maru, Mikasa Maru, and two destroyers of the 2nd Team and two of the 16th Team, along with a large amount of military equipment. There were also more than 2,000 men loaded from the Ryotada Yama Maru, Chikuzen Maru, and Goyo Maru, which entered the port yesterday afternoon and landed at Wusong Yangshupu. There were also a considerable number of plainclothes soldiers. This time, the reinforcements were carried by a total of seven giant merchant ships and four warships, totaling eleven ships. The soldiers loaded numbered seven or eight thousand. However, their numbers are unknown. Some say it is the 8th Division, while others say it is the replenishment team of the 11th and 14th Divisions, who have all landed. A few hundred boxes of artillery, rifles, military telephones, and chemicals, etc., were transported along with the army. They were all unloaded in Shanghai yesterday.</p>

<p>The number of Japanese troops arriving in Shanghai is increasing day by day. Military food, part of which is shipped from the East and part of which is procured from the Yangtze River, is all stored in Shanghai to provide daily food for the various armies. The cannons, bullets, aircraft bombs, and other military supplies and equipment of the various divisions have already been loaded. General Shirakawa has now divided the storage locations for weapons and military food. Because the Yangshupu area has become a safe area, the Japanese army has designated the Yubsen Wharf of the Japanese Postal Company and its insurance warehouses as storage locations for military equipment. All military equipment is stored in these warehouses, and the warehouses at Osaka Wharf are listed as food storage locations for military use. Troops are stationed at both places to guard them strictly. Huangpu Wharf is the place where Japanese soldiers disembark.</p>

<p>In this Shanghai battle, the Japanese soldiers who died numbered more than 10,000, and the 19th Infantry Brigade in the 9th Division suffered the most casualties in the battles of Miaohang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei. At 1 p.m. yesterday, Japanese Commander Ueda held a memorial service for the officers and soldiers of the 19th Brigade who died in battle at Jinan University in Zhenru. The chief celebrant was Ueda Kenkichi.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the main force of the Japanese 14th Division landed near Liuhe this Sunday. Seven transport ships have arrived from Japan carrying approximately 3,000 soldiers of this division, who landed at the Yunzaobang train station and departed for the front line yesterday. The transport ships were escorted by a Japanese cruiser and destroyer fleet and arrived at the mouth of the Song River at dawn on Thursday, successively approaching the Yunzaobang Wharf and unloading the soldiers and war goods day and night until last night (11th), when the last ship was cleared. Among the war goods were heavy artillery pieces with eight-inch calibers, which are the largest artillery pieces that the Japanese army has transported to Shanghai, modeled after the British army's siege artillery. However, according to foreign military experts who have seen this artillery, the Japanese artillery is slightly lighter and easier to move. The troops transported this time included artillery, engineers, and specialized technicians. It is heard that all of them were sent to the Nanshiang headquarters last night. In addition to artillery and bullets, the war goods unloaded included a large team of motor trucks. These trucks were made in the United Kingdom and assembled in Japan, painted in light brown. There were also dozens of bicycles for patrol and communication. They are currently stored at the Yunzaobang headquarters, which has become a large military camp with many battle tents built and countless war goods piled up. While Wusong was busy unloading war goods and soldiers, the Japanese soldiers in the front line and rear areas yesterday changed from a wartime deployment to a defense organization. Large groups of Japanese soldiers in front of Nanshiang and other places retreated slightly, replaced by sentries and patrols.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that while the Chinese and Japanese diplomatic authorities were yesterday engaged in seeking to open peace negotiations, the Japanese military authorities seemed to be making preparations for a war on an even larger scale than last month. Since Thursday, Japanese transport ships have unloaded at least 6,000 new soldiers and a large number of war goods at Wusong, which proves that the three Japanese divisions that have landed in Shanghai intend to stay here for a long time. Four transport ships unloaded soldiers on Thursday, followed by three ships yesterday. It is heard that more soldiers will land today. The war goods transported this time include eight-inch-caliber artillery, as well as bicycles, aircraft, military pigeons, chemicals, hospital supplies, and various other items. The total number of Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai has not been announced, but including the 9th, 11th, and 14th Divisions and the naval landing force, the total number should be more than 70,000.</p>

<p>The League of Nations Commission of Enquiry into the Manchurian Incident, led by Chairman Lord Lytton, along with Italian, French, and German commissioners, US representative Mr. McCoy, and League of Nations secretaries, departed Kobe, Japan, on the 11th aboard the Dairen Kisen Kaisha's Adamas mail ship bound for Shanghai. It is reported that Japanese government commissioners are also accompanying them. Yesterday, the Dairen Kisen Kaisha's Shanghai office received a telegram from the ship stating that it is expected to arrive at the Wusong Sanjia Waterway tonight. For nearly a month, foreign ships have been mostly staying outside of Wusong due to the conflict. Now that the fighting has stopped, the Dairen Kisen Kaisha, due to the League of Nations commissioners being on board, has decided to have the Adamas enter the Huangpu River and anchor at the Bailianjing wharf in Pudong. It is estimated that it will arrive in Shanghai by 8:00 AM tomorrow morning. Dairen has also arranged a small passenger launch to transfer the investigation team to the Customs Wharf in Pudong for disembarkation. Chinese diplomatic officials such as Gu Weijun and Guo Taiqi will be present at the New Customs Wharf to welcome them. The investigation team's office will be located at Sir Robert Ho Tung's residence. Gu has also reserved room 205 at the Cangzhou Hotel to receive inquiries from all sectors.</p>

<p>Wu Tiecheng telegraphs the Central Government, stating he needs to arrive immediately: To the esteemed Administrative Yuan in Luoyang, I, Tiecheng, previously received an appointment as Mayor of Shanghai, which I reluctantly accepted. At a time when the nation is united in spirit to overcome national difficulties, I, Tiecheng, have dedicated myself to the country, daring not to shirk my responsibilities. However, barely a fortnight after assuming office, the January 28th Incident occurred. I, Tiecheng, consider Shanghai to be the financial hub and commercial center of the country, with an exceptionally significant situation and relationships extending far beyond this locality. Therefore, all measures taken in response at that time were handled in accordance with the instructions of the Administrative Yuan. I humbly believe that I lack the virtue to move people and the talent to respond to crises. I am saddened that my efforts have not been able to alleviate the dangers of this great calamity. For the past two months, I have been working diligently from dawn till dusk, exhausting my mental and physical strength, constantly fearing failure. Rather than delaying matters into the future, it is better to exercise caution today. Therefore, I respectfully request to resign from my post. I earnestly pray that you will grant your approval and promptly select a replacement to oversee local affairs. I am deeply grateful. Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, respectfully bows in Zhenyou.</p>

<p>Trenches Are Very Well Made</p>
<p>But There Are No Steel Helmets to Protect Heads</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that Captain Thomason, a well-known American author and naval officer, has taken leave from the US Legation in Peiping to come to Shanghai. He arrived here on Sunday and, accompanied by US Marine Corps Major Kates, toured the Shanghai battle lines. Captain Thomason said, "I know the name of the machine gunner Que Li Zhang, but not the name of the commander of the 19th Route Army." Captain Thomason also expressed his impressions of his tour of the battle lines, saying, "The defensive trench system used by the Chinese army is very well made. Every strategic location is utilized effectively, especially the positions dug behind small hills and mounds. Under constant artillery and aerial bombardment, without attacking the enemy, they are holding their ground, enduring the stress and resisting a strong enemy, which can be described as the most difficult task in the world. The Chinese army had many opportunities to attack the enemy's thinly defended lines and achieve victory, but they chose to defend instead of attack, which is admirable. Many Chinese soldiers are killed or wounded due to head injuries, but the effects of artillery fire and bombs do not seem to be significant. This is because the Chinese soldiers, when lying in the trenches, all wear soft caps and have no steel helmets to protect their heads. When they raise their heads to observe, they are easily hit by bullets from the Japanese lines."</p>
<h3 id="e23">A Record of the Air War in Shanghai <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Written by Japanese Navy Lieutenant Odawara</p>
<p>A Warning for Future Air Warfare</p>
<p>It is well known to the world that the Japanese army took the opportunity to destroy buildings in various places and hinder the progress of our military operations during this incident. The following is a translated summary of an account by Japanese Navy Lieutenant Toshio Odawara, commander of the Japanese air squadron, about his personal experiences in the air war during the Shanghai Incident, which was published in the Osaka Asahi Shimbun. It serves as a warning for our country's future military operations and can also be used as a reference for peace-loving people around the world. On January 28th, due to the sudden change in the situation in Shanghai, our air squadron in North China was ordered to head south. By the next day (29th), it was soaring over the skies of Zhabei. At that time, our army had four seaplanes resisting the enemy. However, although the enemy was numerous, they lacked aircraft to fight us, so they suffered significant coercion from our side. On February 1st, the First Air Combat Squadron, organized by our Second Destroyer Division and flying the flag of Rear Admiral Kato, also appeared in the skies over Shanghai. As a result, the entire Shanghai area was ravaged by our naval aircraft. Our attack aircraft carried 500-kilogram bombs and flew over the Wusong, Lion Grove, and Gaoqiao forts, which were frequently bombed and destroyed by our bombs. From then on, fighter planes carrying bombs participated in ground operations in addition to bombing the forts. On February 5th, four enemy two-seater fighter planes were suddenly discovered on the front lines, giving our army a sense of shock. That morning, the reconnaissance plane commanded by Captain Hiramoto and the fighter plane commanded by Captain Sho, both from our First Destroyer Squadron, departed from the ocean off Wusong, about 70 nautical miles away, to participate in the land battle in Zhabei. They headed to Zhenru to bomb the enemy positions. Unexpectedly, they encountered the enemy's Vought Corsair two-seater fighter plane and began an air battle. In this battle, neither side achieved victory. Subsequently, according to various intelligence reports and Chinese rumors, the enemy had a flying squadron that would depart from Nanjing. However, our army was cautious in naval warfare and never easily discovered the location of the enemy's elevated positions. On the 6th, just as they were about to fly low to reconnoiter the enemy positions, several planes, as many as four, approached our reconnaissance plane. However, air warfare is about surprise attacks. At this time, the enemy plane took a step back, slowly ascending, hoping to fire from above. Captain Sho, who was overseeing the ground enemy forces, looked up and saw the enemy plane with red wings and the Kuomintang flag painted on its wings, seemingly about to attack our reconnaissance plane. Captain Sho quickly dropped bombs on the ground in Zhabei and then flew higher to meet the enemy plane. Before long, the plane commanded by Petty Officer Second Class Kato was also pressured by the enemy plane. The enemy plane suddenly saw our fighter plane rushing to its aid and turned away, hiding in the northern clouds. Captain Sho's plane and Kato's plane both chased the enemy plane north. Captain Hiramoto's reconnaissance plane No. 1 and Captain Tanaka's reconnaissance plane No. 2 attacked repeatedly. The two sides were only 50 meters apart. The enemy plane suddenly fired its machine gun continuously. Our side also fired back. After several rounds of engagement, Hiramoto's plane suddenly took the offensive. The reason why our army gained the upper hand and the enemy retreated was due to our army's ability to adapt to the situation. Subsequently, our fighter planes no longer participated in ground operations, but instead prepared to deal with the enemy's aircraft. The enemy planes did not come again. In order to strike first, our army occupied the airfield outside Shanghai on February 7th, leaving the enemy planes with nowhere to base themselves and making it easier for our planes to operate. After the enemy planes lost their base, they were not seen for a week. On the 10th, we suddenly received intelligence that the enemy flying squadron from Nanjing was about to come to Shanghai to participate in the battle. According to various intelligence reports, the Guangdong army's fighter-bombers had arrived in Changsha. (The reader must sigh at this point at the lack of secrecy in our military operations.) They were expected to arrive in Nanjing around a certain date. Chinese newspapers and Chinese people claimed that the Guangdong planes had departed on a certain day and received a grand send-off from the officials and people of Guangdong Province. Therefore, our side made considerable preparations in advance. By mid-February, it was learned that the existing planes in Nanjing would also be heading south. We predicted that the direct distance from Nanjing to Shanghai was about 150 nautical miles. Considering the performance of those enemy planes, they would not be able to fly directly from Nanjing to Shanghai in one go. They would have to stop and rest at Hongqiao or Suzhou. Therefore, our side decided to conduct aerial reconnaissance between the two places, discovering that the enemy was preparing to build new hangars in both places for several days. Our planes waited day and night for the enemy planes to arrive. As expected, on the 20th, the fighter plane commanded by Captain Sho remotely spotted a new American-style Boeing single-seat fighter plane speeding westward near the Suzhou airfield. Our army bravely approached. The enemy plane, seeing our plane pursuing it, also turned back to respond. However, the enemy plane's special performance, its climbing ability, was superior to ours, so our side was in a passive position. The enemy took advantage of its climbing ability, flew above our plane, spied on our weak points, and suddenly dived down and fired fiercely. Our plane turned around to counterattack. After about 20 minutes of fighting, no winner was decided. Then the enemy used its speed and flew north. Our plane, due to limited fuel, also flew south to return to base. On the 22nd, the reconnaissance plane commanded by Captain Kogani and the fighter plane commanded by Captain Ikuta went to Suzhou again for reconnaissance. Coincidentally, there was a sophisticated plane taking off from that airfield. It was the same plane that had fought with Captain Sho on the 20th. The enemy, seeing our plane arrive, still acted as before, flying high above our plane and suddenly diving down, threatening Captain Kogani. Although our reconnaissance squadron joined the battle, unfortunately, Commander Kogani was suddenly hit by three enemy bullets. The gunner on the commander's plane, Petty Officer First Class Sasaki, was also seriously injured, and the plane crashed. In this battle, it was observed through binoculars that the person piloting the enemy plane was Chinese. Seeing that the enemy plane was too brave to act alone, it was shot down by our plane. On the 23rd, our army continued to use the fighter squadron. It was originally intended to destroy the enemy airfields at Hongqiao and Suzhou. However, there were no planes at the airfields, so there was nothing to gain even if they were destroyed. Suddenly, it was heard that 18 Guangdong planes had gathered in Hangzhou and were preparing to depart. Therefore, in order to strike first, our side hastily formed a large air raid detachment, planning to attack the enemy's air base in Hangzhou. Under my (Odawara's) command, I coordinated with Captain Sata, Captain Yasunobu, Captain Sho, Captain Atsumi, and other elite attack and fighter planes, secretly stipulating a meeting point 120 miles from the mouth of Wusong. At the same time, the aircraft carrier HMS X and others secretly set out, agreeing to depart from 5:00 AM the next day, flying directly to the enemy's air base in Hangzhou. But the most difficult thing about this matter was the maximum amount of fuel that should be loaded into our planes and the distance from the nearby location of the base, fearing that if we went deep into the enemy's territory, any obstacles would lead to unrecoverable consequences. Therefore, I was quite anxious at the time. However, since I had been ordered to carry out the mission, I did not consider success or failure. Therefore, the attack squadron protected the fighter squadron and set off, secretly tracing the mouth of the Qiantang River. In the faint morning light, we suddenly flew over the sky above Hangzhou City, overlooking the Jianqiao Airfield outside Hangzhou City, which was clearly visible. Just as we were about to drop bombs, we saw five enemy planes suddenly rising into the sky and engaging our planes fiercely. At that time, our 15 planes were more than enough to deal with the enemy's five fighter planes.</p>
<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>We were able to calmly bomb the enemy's airfield. After that, the squadrons flew to the designated location outside the mouth of the Qiantang River. The first to return was Sata's squadron, followed by Yasunobu's squadron No. 2. However, Odawara's squadron was the last to return because the bombs dropped did not explode and there were obstacles along the way. Six planes were destroyed by our bombing this time. However, we remembered that there were not 18 enemy planes at the airfield, and we were very suspicious. Little did we know that the enemy's low-wing monoplane had already flown to another location. When they heard that our plane was attacking, they followed behind us and first engaged Odawara's squadron. Because the enemy planes were skillful, revolving up and down, they were also very light and agile, and they joined with six other fighter planes, pressing in every step of the way. At that time, Atsumi saw that the situation was critical and joined in the support. Finally, several planes were destroyed by our side. Although the rest of the enemy planes collided with great force, our side relied on the power of the revolving gun to defend bravely. The enemy ultimately failed to succeed. At this point, the enemy planes flew south. Our attack planes were also damaged. Later, it was heard that Squadron Leader Yasunobu had radioed for help from a destroyer 20 miles from the mouth of the Qiantang River, and two planes had landed near the warship. Then they all returned to base. This is a rough overview of the air war since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident. In short, the essence of air warfare is based on 30% technology and 70% spirit. The failure of the Chinese air squadron was due to a lack of aviation technology.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the 19th Route Army recently received a cable from the front line stating: "The army is deeply grateful for the continuous donations and慰问 from all sectors. However, most of the donated miscellaneous items are not suitable for use at the front line, wasting resources, which is regrettable. If all sectors are enthusiastic about donating in the future, it is best to give cash so that the army can purchase the necessary items itself, or send people to the Beijing-Shanghai line to purchase grain and deliver it to the front line, which is also more practical."</p>

<p>The National Wounded Soldiers Hospital, located at Jiaotong University on Haig Road, is a recently established hospital for wounded soldiers. It was organized by Chinese and foreign enthusiasts to rescue wounded soldiers in the Shanghai battle. Newspaper reporters visited yesterday and were received by Madam Soong Ching-ling. The following is a record of the Q&amp;A: (Q) How is the National Wounded Soldiers Hospital organized? (A) A few friends and I (Madam Soong referring to herself), seeing the loyalty and bravery of the 19th Route Army in defending the country against the enemy, realized that they are a true people's force. We should do our best to care for their wounded soldiers. At the same time, we felt that there were many scattered wounded soldiers hospitals in Shanghai, so there should be a permanent and centralized organization. Therefore, the National Wounded Soldiers Hospital was established. Madam Liao He Xiangning, Madam Chen Zhu Guangzhen, and I were publicly elected as directors, and Dr. Maxwell serves as the vice president. In addition, there are many Chinese and Western experts who are responsible for medical affairs. All the staff in the hospital are volunteers and do not receive any salary. The only simple purpose of our hospital is to rescue and treat the wounded soldiers who are fighting hard for China in this battle, and to provide them with spiritual comfort and encouragement. Anyone who shares the same views is welcome to participate and assist. (Q) What are Madam Sun's views on the recent war and political stance? (A) My personal political views have been expressed in previous statements. As for the anti-Japanese war, I naturally advocate active resistance to the end. Humans can only seek survival through struggle. Revolutionaries should only ask what is right and wrong, regardless of current interests. The 19th Route Army, knowing that the strength and equipment are inferior to the enemy, can disregard everything and use flesh and blood to fight for a chance for China to survive, letting the world know that China still has an army and national spirit that cannot be insulted. They are not only a model for the army, but also a revolutionary force and the vanguard against imperialism. Our establishment of this hospital is only standing in the position of a member of the people to express our admiration and gratitude to these unprecedented revolutionary fighters. Those who consider themselves clever and disregard public opinion often use the strength and weakness of success or failure to cover up their failure to resist. They do not know that only the truly intelligent can seek life from death and safety from danger. The Japanese army said that it could eliminate the 19th Route Army in 48 hours. A certain military expert said that Japan could blockade China in three days. Now, after a month of hard fighting, the 19th Route Army can continue to resist. China has not only not perished because of resistance, but has become stronger because of resistance. Everyone thinks that China's war this time is a failure. In fact, China has completely won spiritually. What Japan has gained is only material victory. The people who gain spiritual victory will become more and more enthusiastic in the realm of greatness and glory.

<p>The Russian Community Thanks You for Your Help in Times of Crisis</p>
<p>There is No Evidence of Helping Japan Against China</p>
<p>The President of the Russian Emigrant Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers Association yesterday, which reads: "Dear Chairman, I admire your leadership and stewardship of the leading Chinese organization. The Russian community is deeply grateful for the grace and compassion of your great nation in allowing us to live and thrive in times of difficulty and crisis. I would like to express my highest gratitude on behalf of the Russian Emigrant Association in Shanghai. Since the beginning of the war, our compatriots have witnessed the suffering of the Chinese people and share their anger. We know that the future of our Russian community is closely related to China. The misfortune of China is the misfortune of our Russian community. We are grateful for China's help in times of crisis and are eager to repay it. In the current crisis, we feel it is especially important to be loyal. Our Association knew that the Russian community in Shanghai would encounter slander and insults during this period of military and political urgency. Those who hate us are determined to sever the friendly relations between China and Russia. Therefore, on January 29, the Standing Committee of our Association decided to issue a notice to all Russians in Shanghai, informing them of their responsibilities to the Chinese nation and urging them to work hard to maintain local security, assist the Chinese and Western authorities, and maintain the治安 in the Chinese and French Concessions. All actions that harm the Chinese nation are strictly prohibited. At the same time, we ordered all Russian community organizations to register the unemployed so that they would not use their labor to support those who are hostile to China. This notice was published in Russian, English, and French newspapers. Later, when the Association heard that some Russians were being enticed by large sums of money to work as drivers for the Japanese and to load and unload Japanese ships, it immediately conducted an inspection. It was found that the Russian community organizations registered with our Association had never used their labor to support countries at war with China. Later, it was found that the people hired were directly recruited by a certain foreign business, and their number, including drivers, was less than 70. The drivers were hired to drive private cars to transport the dead and wounded for Japanese hospitals. The rest were loading and unloading ships at Japanese docks, and there were also Chinese workers among them. Later, it was rumored that Russian workers were filling in airfields for the Japanese in Yangshupu. After investigation, it was found that 60 unemployed Russian workers were hired by a certain private employment agency to load and unload ships that were about to leave Shanghai. Only later did they learn that the claim that they were loading ships was a lie. All the workers were transported by trucks to Yangshupu Road to fill in the open space and work with Chinese workers. In the above two cases, the applicants were all lower-class Russian workers who had been unemployed for many months and were in dire straits. On February 26, the Guomin News Agency issued a telegram from Qingdao, stating that the Japanese ship Changchun Maru had arrived in Qingdao from Dalian, carrying 375 White Russians, fully armed, all experienced soldiers, recruited by the Japanese Kwantung authorities, and now serving as an attack force against the Chinese army on the Shanghai front. This telegram was published in the Dalubao and other Chinese newspapers. The Dalubao also added an editor's note, stating that 500 White Russians arrived in Shanghai yesterday from the Changchun Maru and were immediately assigned to the Japanese front line to transport military supplies, dig trenches, and perform other labor. These White Russians were hired by the Japanese in Harbin, Changchun, and Dalian. After investigation, it was learned that the White Russians who arrived in Shanghai on February 17 were not Russians, but German colonists who had fled to Manchuria from Soviet Russia a year earlier. They were now being transported by the South China Committee of the League of Nations to Paraguay in South America via Marseille and Baidu. The number was 373, including 31 children under the age of three and 87 children between the ages of three and twelve. The rest were elderly, weak, men, and women, and were not suitable for military use. They left Shanghai on a French ship that day. Mr. Gu Anlu, the representative of the South China Committee, also published a notice in the Russian newspaper and the Dalubao to avoid misunderstanding. There are several groups in Shanghai that specialize in spreading rumors, causing the friendly relations between the Russian community and the Chinese people to be severed. This kind of anti-Russian propaganda and anti-Chinese propaganda come from the same source. Our Russian community has a clear conscience and abides by the law. We especially detest subversive political activities. Those who spread rumors only want to make the Russian community lose the sympathy of the Chinese people and make your government lose the assistance of a loyal people in order to eliminate the red influence. I would like to present the above facts to you for your consideration. Our Association has authorized me to express our highest respect to your Association and to express our willingness to cooperate with your Association to promote the welfare of your great nation and people. I hope you will understand. According to this letter, the signatory is Mr. Kredner. Mr. Kredner has written two books specializing in the municipal history of the Shanghai Concession. His erudition is considered a masterpiece."</p>

<h3 id="e28">Japanese Plane Opened Fire Outside Songjiang West <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Japanese planes have recently been flying over Songjiang to reconnoiter the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Yesterday (11th) at around 3:00 PM, a plane flew over Songjiang again. Near Bridge No. 30, it saw a few Chinese troops patrolling here and immediately opened fire, firing one shot, and then left. The people of Songjiang were already like startled birds. Hearing the gunshot, they became even more uneasy. However, the rumors circulating outside that the Japanese plane flew to Songjiang City and strafed with live ammunition, and that people were hiding in their houses, are absolutely false.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Red Cross Society Hosts Banquet for Representatives of the International Red Cross <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, the Red Cross Society hosted a banquet at the Cathay Hotel for Mr. Brown, representative of the International Red Cross, Mr. Foster, representative of the American Red Cross, the chairman of the conference, councilors, presidents, directors, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Peiyuan, Wen Lanting, Wang Xiaolai, Di Chuqing, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Yao Yuqin, and guests Xu Jingren, Zhu Ziqiao. Mr. Wang Yaoting, the English secretary of the society, was also present. The atmosphere was harmonious, reflecting the strong diplomatic relations. During the banquet, President Yu Qiaqing delivered a speech, the gist of which was that today, the members of the society have prepared a simple vegetable meal to respectfully invite Dr. Brown and Mr. Foster to grace them with their presence, which is a great honor. However, the welcome from the members of the society is to welcome the spirit of justice and integrity of the Red Cross to descend upon East Asia, which is by no means comparable to ordinary social courtesies. Because this time China is fighting to resist Japan, the society, in order to fulfill the purpose of universal love and caring for soldiers, has carried out rescue work under fire in accordance with the Geneva Convention, resulting in three casualties, two deaths, four missing, three seriously injured, and one wounded soldiers' hospital destroyed by bombing. There were also many minor injuries and near misses from gunfire. The society has compiled photographs of soldiers and civilians wounded by dumdum bullets who have been rescued, and respectfully requests Dr. Brown and Mr. Foster to take them to the International Red Cross and the American Red Cross for reference. In short, the actions of the opposing army this time are actually related to the general issue of the signatory countries of the International Red Cross. The society can only adhere to the purpose of universal love and caring for soldiers, strictly abide by the charter of the International Red Cross, not fear difficulties and dangers, and work hard. Today, taking advantage of the presence of Mr. Brown and Mr. Foster, who have brought the spirit of the International Red Cross to Asia, we respectfully inform you of the society's purpose, and hope that Mr. Brown and Mr. Foster will provide guidance and criticism on the society's work, which would be greatly welcomed. We wish the International Red Cross long life, the American Red Cross long life, and we wish Mr. Brown and Mr. Foster good health. Next, Chairman Wang Yiting gave a speech, saying that this unfortunate incident has occurred, and it is a great honor to have Mr. Brown, representative of the International Red Cross, and Mr. Foster, representative of the American Red Cross, present. War is the most tragic thing for mankind, and the Red Cross has the purpose of universal love and caring for soldiers. When this tragic event occurs, we can only do our best to fulfill our duties. We sincerely hope that the two gentlemen will instill the spirit of the Red Cross everywhere, so that mankind will forever love each other and never have this tragic event occur, so that the Red Cross's work of rescuing wounded soldiers will be abolished forever, which is what the society hopes. Mr. Brown then delivered a speech, and Mr. Foster also gave a speech of thanks. The banquet ended at 3 pm.</p>

<p>Qingpu New Society Donates 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>To Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai, Army Commander Cai Tingkai, Commander Dai Ji, and all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army: This time, the violent Japanese invaded, and our 19th Route Army rose up to kill the enemy and fought hard for more than a month. Although they were repeatedly attacked on all sides and the numbers were vastly different, they were able to hold on to Shanghai and resist calmly. Such steadfast and extraordinary spirit is enough to move heaven and earth to tears. However, because the isolated army was cut off from reinforcements, they withdrew from Shanghai. The fault lies elsewhere, as everyone in the country has seen. The members of our society have engraved in their hearts the magnificent achievements of our 19th Route Army over the past thirty-odd days. We unanimously admire and support you. We have collected 1,000 yuan to send to you first as a token of our condolences. We deeply believe that our 19th Route Army will definitely maintain its fearless spirit and resist the violent Japanese for a long time to come, returning our land and glorifying our nation. The members of our society will be your strong supporters. Attached is a Shanghai New China Bank draft for 1,000 yuan. Sincerely, the members of the Qingpu New Society.</p>

<p>Various charitable organizations in Shanghai, concerned about the corpses filling the war zone and the potential for epidemics, have jointly organized the Shanghai War Zone Temporary Burial Office to handle the burial of corpses and disinfection and epidemic prevention in the war zone.

(2) The Pushan Villa's blue, heart-shaped white cross flag and armband will be used for identification to ensure uniformity. In addition, the emblem or flag of the organization representing the burial work can also be used. (3) The number of people collected and buried each day and their locations should be listed and reported by the burial organizations to inform the various organizations. (4) All necessary permits and flags required for going to various areas can be negotiated with the Shanghai War Zone Temporary Refugee Relief Association at any time for assistance. (5) The passports, permits, armbands, and flags issued to the organizations are for the sole purpose of burying corpses and must not be misused to transport people or goods. If such a situation occurs, the head of the issuing organization will be responsible. It is reported that in addition to reporting to the Chinese and Japanese military and political authorities for proper assistance, the work has already begun actively.</p>

<p>The Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee, organized by Zhu Qinglan and Zheng Hongnian, recently noted that while charitable organizations have established a Relatives Relief Association to care for the orphans and widows of soldiers who died defending the country, there are still no proper arrangements for wounded and disabled veterans. Therefore, they are actively preparing to establish a hospital for disabled soldiers, so that these patriotic veterans can be comforted and encouraged to resist Japan. At the same time, a large-scale wounded soldiers' hospital will also be established. Wang Yacao, Liu Shimu, Wu Shan, and others have been designated to draft the charter so that it can be established as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The spirit of the 19th Route Army's brave fight against the enemy and its efforts to defend the country is truly admirable. Mr. Ding Mengxing, a wealthy businessman in this city, in addition to providing various supplies to comfort the officers and soldiers at the front, also independently funded the establishment of the Sixth Wounded Soldiers' Hospital at 10 Zhangjiabang Road, Maybridge Road, with the assistance of Dr. Tan Yili, director of the International YMCA Hospital, in all matters. Since the hospital opened half a month ago, it has admitted more than a hundred wounded soldiers. Director Tan Yili, General Affairs Director Zhang Yun, and Medical Director Yang Baoan, as well as American Dr. MacDrachen and other famous doctors from the Tongren Hospital, all have special medical expertise, so that many, regardless of the severity of their injuries, are healed. The Red Cross Society has sent Nurse Director Tang Jingqun to the hospital to take charge of nursing affairs. In addition, Miss Liu Jisheng and three Misses Jing Guozhen are also taking care of the wounded soldiers, and their enthusiasm is commendable. The equipment in the hospital is very complete, and all Chinese and foreign guests who come to the hospital to offer condolences praise it as the most complete wounded soldiers' hospital in Shanghai. In recent days, there has been a constant stream of Chinese and foreign people who have come to offer their condolences. All matters in the hospital are managed by Chen Dafang, Wang Xinpan, and Li Fenglai. Mrs. Ding Mengxing and her daughter, Wu Ding Weiying, pay special attention to the hygiene of the hospital and personally supervise everything every morning and evening. Her son, Tai Zhen, who is only eleven years old, has also used all his savings to buy milk and cigarettes to distribute to the wounded soldiers as a sign of respect.</p>

<p>Conflict with the Chief of the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Mai, who is known for his courage in publicizing his views, at 2 pm yesterday, accompanied by one male student and two female students, went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to see Director Wen, requesting permission to bail out a certain student who had been arrested on suspicion of being a reactionary. Section Chief Wu Zhiquan of the Third Section received them. During the meeting, because the case of the arrested student was under preliminary investigation, bail was not allowed according to regulations. However, Wu insisted that since there was no sufficient evidence, the freedom of the people could not be restricted according to law. Section Chief Wu replied that there was evidence, so an investigation was necessary. Unexpectedly, Wu expressed dissatisfaction, saying that for the sake of protecting human rights, he insisted on bail. When the request was not granted, a conflict arose between the two. Section Chief Wu sternly told him that lawyers should abide by the law and should not engage in abusive behavior. Wu became angry and used force. After a report to Director Wen, Wu was arrested, and the three male and female students who went with him were also detained pending legal action.</p>

<p>Japanese Authorities Strictly Cracking Down</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that many Chinese returning to their former residences in the Hongkou District and the Jessfield Road area have been subjected to illegal treatment by Japanese ruffians. These people often forcibly extort money from Chinese who are moving their household goods. When this came to the attention of the Japanese authorities, they immediately cracked down and arrested many people. Those whose cases were serious have been deported back to their country. According to an investigation yesterday, residents moving their belongings can now avoid interference. The Public Works Department authorities have issued more than 15,000 permits for entering the two districts in recent days. The Public Works Department police are continuing to take care of residents who are legally moving their belongings.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the morning market for silver was 7 qian 2 fen 1 li, the same price as the afternoon market, a decrease of a little over 1 li compared to the previous day. The exchange rate for silver in both markets was 2 qian 5 fen. With the addition of water, it was 1 liang 34 qian. The bank's posted price was still 1 qian. The amount of remittance drafts made in the morning market was 252,000, and the amount in the afternoon market was 225,000. The price of auxiliary coins was the same in both markets for the Jiangnan small silver dollar, at 6 qian 2 fen 8 li. There were 3,000 jiao traded in the morning market and no transactions in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver dollar was 6 qian 3 fen 8 li in the morning market and 6 qian 3 fen 7 li 2 hao 5 si in the afternoon market.

<p>Yesterday's gold market situation was ordinary. Trading was not as active as the day before yesterday. Both the bullish and bearish sides felt a lack of interest. However, each followed its own path, and the market price showed a rebound after three days of successive increases, falling again by more than seven taels. The trading time within the venue was only one hour, and the fluctuations were not significant, only exceeding five taels. All overseas silver markets saw British gains and American stability. This was because the exchange rate trends differed, with the British pound being strong and the American dollar weak. Bank transactions were limited. Although the war is relatively far from Shanghai, the situation remains uncertain, and people inevitably feel uneasy. The after-market continued. At 9:30, the April opening price fell by six taels to 653 taels. The large silver bar rose another sixteen and three-eighths. The American silver remained unchanged, and foreign exchange listings remained unchanged. Subsequently, it slightly decreased by five qian, with only two taels of fluctuation. This was because the internal 美金 in the near term was tighter than the far term. Next month's settlement was over 32.8125 yuan. Also, the 英日 Bank did 33 yuan for June. And Shang Zhifeng, Yong Da Cheng, Heng Yu, and others' buying interest was not weak, so it was raised by three or four taels. At 9:45, it was 57 taels. Suddenly, Qian Changxiang, Sen Chang, Yong Fu, Tai Xiang, Yuan Mao, Yong and others came to sell. The Dalian gang sold May 美金 at 33 yuan, so the price fell back by more than four taels. Around 10 o'clock, it was 52 and a half taels. Bing Xing and others bought in, immediately adding one tael to 54 taels. As the exchange rate was still stable, the trading was weak. Hong Kang and others sold, and the price fell by more than two taels. Before 10:30, the closing price was 51 and a half taels, down seven and a half taels from the previous afternoon. The highest was 57 taels, and the lowest was 50 and a half taels. The quoted price was still 750 taels, calculating a deduction of 97 taels to 93 taels. The registered price was 51 taels to 52 taels, and the margin call was 51 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the London large silver bar continued to rise by 0.1875, with the near-term calculated at 18 pence and 0.0625, and the far-term at 10 pence and 0.25. Chinese mainland buying caused it to rise, with weak trading. The after-market was soft due to American selling. According to the New York telegram, the American silver remained unchanged at 29.75 cents. The market was flat. The Mumbai market added 8 annas, calculating 56 rupees and 10 annas. The London shilling added 0.125, calculating 1 shilling and 10 pence and 0.125. The exchange rate for British pounds against American dollars continued to fall by 1.5 cents, calculating 3 yuan and 64 cents. American dollars against British pounds rebounded by 0.75, calculating 3 yuan and 63 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, except for the German exchange rate, which added half a yuan to 135 marks, all other HSBC listings remained unchanged. The internal market seemed to show a diverging trend, with the British pound strengthening and the American dollar weakening, due to the relationship between exchange rates. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British gold decreased by 0.125, the American dollar was flat in the near term, and increased by 0.25 in the far term, resulting in a divergent market. Few Chinese merchants entered or exited, with the Dalian gang slightly selling only 120,000 pounds of British gold and 120,000 yuan of American dollars, which was not as active as the day before yesterday. Hedgers were also stagnant.</p>

Over twenty representatives attended including Gu Zhuxuan and others. Chairman Gu made the following resolutions: (1) Gu Nanqun proposed that enemy spies who have been executed should be treated according to past practices, not just labeled as Jiangbei people. Future cases should be treated similarly, and many newspapers often report them as Jiangbei people, causing much misunderstanding. It should be explained to the newspapers. It was resolved that this afternoon (13th) at 2 PM, the press would be invited to the Atlantic Hotel. (2) Gu Zhuxuan proposed that many fellow villagers residing in Zhabei who lost their homes due to the war have moved inland and often face unreasonable rejection, which could lead them to desperation. The provincial government should be requested to instruct all counties to properly settle them, and those returning to their hometowns should also be protected. The resolution was passed. The associations have established a joint office at 351 Dajiangnan Hotel to facilitate contact.</p>

According to Mr. Weng's letter, he said, for example, "It is rumored that someone overseas remitted 5,000 yuan, marked for the Central Finance Department for collection, but there is no such organization in Shanghai, so it was casually handed over to the Central Bank," etc. We sincerely request that your newspaper publish this letter to make a correction. We express our deepest gratitude to the chief editors of the newspapers in this city. Joint Office of the Native Place Associations in Shanghai, Recorder Wang Yisun, March 12.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Wang Jingwei's Speech on the Significance of Coping with National Crisis <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Report at the Memorial Service for the Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Death</p>
<p>Need for the Determination and Methods to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Cannot Mislead with Empty and Exaggerated Rhetoric</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 12th was the seventh anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. The Central Party Headquarters' Office in Nanjing held a memorial service at the Central Party Headquarters Auditorium at 9:00 AM. Members of the Central Committee including Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Chen Bijun, Chiang Kai-shek, Gu Mengyu, Chu Minyi, Chen Mingshu, Cheng Tianfang, Chen Bulei, Zhang Daofan, and others, as well as representatives from various agencies and all staff members of the Central Party Headquarters, totaling over 500 people, attended. After Ju Zheng led the ceremony, Wang Zhaoming delivered a speech on the significance of the memorial, stating that every year on this day since Sun Yat-sen's death in the 14th year of the Republic, we have had infinite grief and feelings, especially today when the national crisis is at hand, which makes us feel doubly uneasy and painful. We know that every country in the world will have national crises, because the world today is not about justice but about power. Sun Yat-sen's teachings were to enable China to escape the national crisis. Now Japan tells the League of Nations investigation team that China has become increasingly xenophobic since the Kuomintang took power. In fact, Sun Yat-sen's teachings were only to seek freedom and equality for China. China's pursuit of freedom and equality is beneficial to East Asian peace and the world community. However, why is this meaning not understood by neighboring countries? Why does Japan still say we are xenophobic? This is entirely because Japan does not want China to gain freedom and equality, because if China gains freedom and equality, Japan will not be able to fulfill its ambitions of aggression. The Twenty-One Demands and the tragic Jinan Incident after the founding of the Republic of China are enough to show Japan's intentions. Therefore, everyone must understand that China's current national crisis is due to its pursuit of freedom and equality. But we do not give up our pursuit of freedom and equality because of the national crisis. We want to eliminate the national crisis. Today, as we commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we must find ways to break the national crisis that Sun Yat-sen foresaw in order to be worthy of being his followers. We must resolutely resist Japan's aggression, but the meaning of resistance must be clear. Now we often hear people say that we must be tough on Japan. If someone within the party advocates not being tough, then this person will definitely be sacrificed. If the Kuomintang is not tough, then the Kuomintang will definitely be overthrown. We fundamentally disagree with this statement. We should clearly analyze domestic and foreign affairs, and we must not use diplomacy as a tool of domestic politics. If we use a tough policy to gain the trust of the party and the people, this is completely wrong. The autocratic monarchs of the past, when faced with domestic difficulties, would shift the domestic focus by addressing foreign issues. Even if the country is rich and the army is strong, being able to establish prestige abroad is a crime, let alone now that the opposing country is much richer and stronger than us. How can we gamble the country? Therefore, using a tough policy to maintain the power of one person or party is fundamentally wrong. If we do this, we will misunderstand the meaning of determination to resist. In the third year of the Republic, Yuan Shikai signed the Twenty-One Demands, explaining that China could not defeat Japan, so he temporarily endured humiliation and bore heavy burdens, thus sowing the seeds of the current national crisis. If Yuan Shikai had been determined to resist at that time, perhaps Shandong, the Northeast, and the area along the Yangtze River and the coast would have been occupied by Japan, but after the European War, China would have had the opportunity to revive. At the Washington Conference, if China had not signed the Twenty-One Demands, what we would have gained would definitely not have been limited to the Nine-Power Treaty. Unfortunately, Yuan Shikai sought temporary peace and lost China's opportunity to revive, and planted the seeds of today's evil consequences. Therefore, since September 18 of last year, we have absolutely refused to sign any treaty that cedes rights and humiliates the country. This is entirely a policy determined for China's future. This is the meaning of our resistance. As for the method of resistance, we can only follow Sun Yat-sen's teachings and carry it out conscientiously. Some popular slogans and banners, such as "Kill to Tokyo," If he is a follower of Sun Yat-sen, he would never have such exaggerated words. Japan is a naval power. May I ask if we have a comparable navy that can kill to Tokyo? This completely shows that we do not know our own strength, nor do we know the enemy's strength. This is extremely dangerous. We should know that we are not as good as Japan in material terms, but we are determined not to succumb to violence and to use all our strength to resist Japan. Only by understanding this meaning can we think of a method of resistance. Another example is the so-called "national general mobilization." This sentence can be said in Japan because Japan has conscription, so when war is encountered, the whole country can be mobilized. As for us, we still have a recruitment system. Transferring and transferring is just the existing army. The three words "general mobilization" are unnecessary. What we need today is national defense preparedness, everyone resists, and every place resists, so that Japan's aggressive actions will encounter obstacles everywhere. This is the method of resistance that arises from the meaning of resistance. In addition, a kind of empty and hollow urging war theory is also enough to mislead things. We are reminded of the scene at the end of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, Manchuria rose in the Northeast, and bandits rose in the Northwest. The so-called patriotism of the court and the public was an empty and hollow urging war theory. Regardless of the people in power and the people leading the troops, they were not allowed to judge the situation and have the possibility of advancing, retreating, accelerating, or slowing down. They must be blindly moving forward with the urging theory. We try to examine the edicts, memorials, and so-called public opinion at that time, and we can see this situation everywhere. What was the result? People with conscience and enthusiasm died to serve the country. People without conscience and enthusiasm could only surrender. The Book of Songs says it well, "When people die, the country is exhausted." When people with conscience and enthusiasm die, the country will also perish. We now know that we are not as good as Japan in terms of various material conditions, but we will never succumb to Japanese violence and will use all our strength to resist Japan. But we must also know ourselves and our enemies, make good use of our strengths, and hide our weaknesses, and we must not have vanity and arrogance. In short, we must think of a method of resistance based on the meaning of resistance. We know that Sun Yat-sen's teachings teach us to understand the method of resistance. We know that Sun Yat-sen's teachings teach us to understand the general trend of the world. Exaggerated words and rash actions are absolutely not allowed by him. To deal with the current national crisis, we can only resist for a long time, and the so-called resistance must have the determination to resist, and also the method of resistance. If we have the determination but no method, then China may perish. If we have the determination and the method, then China will definitely be able to find peace in danger and survive in death. Now, as we commemorate Sun Yat-sen's death, although we have infinite grief and pain, we generate courage from grief. We are struggling calmly with firm determination and appropriate methods. We believe that China's national crisis will definitely be broken and Sun Yat-sen's teachings will definitely be realized. (Special telegram on the 12th)</p>

<p>Expressing Opposition to the Five-Colored New Flag</p>
<p>First Voice in Condemning the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to the semi-official TASS news agency, a serious uprising against Manchuria occurred today in Dachehe (Hailanpao). The Chinese garrison stationed there opened fire with rifles and machine guns to express their opposition to the hanging of the new five-colored flag. After the battle, the soldiers of the Manchurian state were arrested, and many of the Manchurian state army's staff and officers were killed. A Japanese barber and a photographer also died in the battle. English customs inspector Klausner and his wife have fled to the other side of the Amur River and are safe in Russia. The president of a Chinese bank and several residents of Dachehe have also crossed the river to seek refuge. The families of the Russian consulate staff are now moving to Moscow. (Reuters telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to the Soviet news agency, news from Hailanpao in the Russian territory of the Black Dragon River, at 5:00 PM on March 10, the troops stationed in Sakhalin, China (on the right bank of the mouth of the Black Dragon River, facing Hailanpao across the river), were indignant to see the appearance of the flag of the new Manchurian government. They rioted as a result. At the beginning of the uprising, the sound of cannons rumbled, and the sound of machine guns was incessant. Occasionally, bullets flew across the Black Dragon River and reached Hailanpao. It is reported that the chief of staff of the Manchurian government army has been arrested by the rebels, and ten officers have been killed. On the evening of that day, the mutiny army divided into two teams and stationed themselves in the east and west corners of the city. (Havas telegram on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet Russian government received a report that yesterday afternoon, when the so-called new flag of the Manchurian independent state was erected in Sakhalin on the Black Dragon River, opposite Hailanpao, the Chinese troops stationed there suddenly rioted. The Chinese troops used rifles and machine guns to bombard the officials of the new government. Stray bullets flew to Hailanpao, but there was no damage. It is reported that the commander sent by the new government has been captured by the mutiny soldiers, and ten officers have been killed. It is reported that the Japanese consul, the English tax commissioner, the president of the Bank of China, and Soviet Russian officials are now all living in Hailanpao. The mutiny soldiers have robbed four Chinese banks, Soviet Russian commercial banks, and a Chinese-owned store. They are now defending the fortress. (National telegram on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army received a report from Shenyang soliciting news of the Dachehe mutiny, but did not mention the details. The non-political circles now believe that it was instigated by the son of Wan Fulin. According to news from Harbin, one Japanese person fled across the river to Hailanpao. The fate of twelve other Japanese people is unknown. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese had expected this, so the Japanese consul in Hailanpao recently asked the Soviet Russian authorities to protect Japanese citizens in the event of a mutiny.

The guest house for the inspection team is planned to be either Song's residence in Beijige or the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Special telegram on the 12th)</p>

The reception matters in Kyoto are also being prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At that time, all members of the Central Committee, the President of the National Government, and the Prime Minister of the Executive Yuan will gather in Kyoto to receive them. (Special telegram on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The preparatory committee for welcoming the international investigation team in Kyoto held a preparatory meeting on the 11th. In addition to detailed decisions on various matters to be prepared for the welcome, it also resolved: 1. Telegraph Shanghai to welcome them; 2. Suggest to the Central Government to notify the Shanghai authorities to guide the team to inspect the war zone as much as possible when it arrives in Shanghai; 3. After the team arrives in Kyoto, hold a memorial service for the anti-Japanese martyrs. (Special telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told people here today that the government has instructed the front-line commanders that if the inspectors of the great powers want to inspect the Chinese military front lines, they can be given various conveniences. China is willing to abide by the resolutions passed by the League of Nations and the principles agreed upon on the British flagship Kent, but other conditions cannot be accepted. Today, Ambassador Shigemitsu has expressed his willingness to negotiate, so he hopes that negotiations can begin as soon as possible. The spokesperson also said that the Shanghai meeting will discuss the withdrawal of Japanese troops, but other issues cannot be discussed. Although there is a possibility of resolving the situation in Shanghai, the Chinese government is still paying attention to the issue of the three northeastern provinces and has repeatedly instructed Representative Yan to raise the matter to the League of Nations, demanding a fair solution.

<p>(Nanjing) When the League of Nations General Assembly passed a resolution on the 11th, our country's representative did not vote. A reporter specially visited Foreign Minister Luo to inquire about the truth. Minister Luo replied as follows: When the League of Nations General Assembly passed a resolution on the afternoon of the 11th, our country's representative did vote. The reason for this was that the time between the issuance of the resolution by the League of Nations General Assembly and the formal adoption of the resolution by the General Assembly was too short, so the instructions from our government could not reach our country's representative in time. This was because our country's representative sent the full text of the draft at 2:00 PM (Geneva time) on the 10th, and the government received the full text at 7:00 PM (Nanjing time) on the 11th. Instructions were issued within one hour, but the League of Nations General Assembly was held that afternoon at 11:00 PM (Nanjing time) in Geneva, so the instructions were difficult to reach. In addition, the telegraph communication between Nanjing and Shanghai has been extremely slow recently, causing the Foreign Ministry's telegraph transmission to be particularly delayed compared to normal. On the 12th, the Foreign Ministry again instructed our country's representative to notify the League of Nations General Assembly that it accepted the resolution. Fortunately, even without China and Japan voting, the League of Nations resolution had already been unanimously passed, which did not affect its legal effect. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since the National Government moved to Luoyang, various Yuan, ministries, and committees have only sent a small number of personnel to work there due to insufficient material supplies. When handling important cases, retrieving files is time-consuming and the procedures are rather inflexible.

One sentence in the letter stated that the industrial output of the Caucasus has exceeded 350% compared to before the European War, which can not only be said to be a success of socialist construction, but also, in view of the increasing aggression of capitalists and the imminent war, the increase in such output is even more important. The letter also urged the workers of the Transcaucasian Federation to continue to revitalize the proletarian state, consolidate its defenses, and first and foremost, fulfill the plan to develop agriculture and industry, and strive to exceed the original plan.</p>

<p>Hindenburg's Speech Receives Good Image</p>
<p>But Hitler Still Has a Strong Opponent</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th: Today is the last day of the presidential election campaign. Various factions planned to hold a torchlight parade in the evening. The police, fearing that the public would be emotionally charged and unrestrained, banned outdoor gatherings this morning and strictly enforced it throughout the day. Since early morning, special air police teams have been dispatched to assist, and police sirens have been sounded to warn the public. The leaders of various factions have changed to sending people door-to-door to distribute leaflets. A huge colored photo of Hindenburg has been installed in Potsdam Square, and a smaller photo has been placed on the opposite building. All will be lit tonight. This morning, many newspapers advised voters to vote for Hindenburg. It is heard that Hindenburg will also issue another declaration tonight.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th: President Hindenburg's election speech was broadcast to German and Austrian radio stations, and then to European and American radio stations, causing a good response everywhere. According to a Geneva dispatch, hundreds of representatives there had listened to it, and news from all sides stated that the president's speech was very moving and proved that this old man had the special talent to lead the country.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 12th: Today, the topic of conversation in streetcars, trams, and coffee shops is almost entirely the presidential election. Everyone is asking: Hitler or Hindenburg? And it is common to see groups of people gathering in the streets and arguing with each other. The people are very disappointed with the current state of the country and are dissatisfied, so the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party have gained momentum. What is now certain is that Hindenburg may get more votes than Hitler, but he will certainly not get the qualified majority of votes in the first election to be re-elected. The National Socialist Party's hope is tied to the second vote. At that time, only Hitler and Hindenburg will compete, or they may win with the help of supporters of Duesterberg, the presidential candidate of the Steel Helmet.</p>

<p>Reuters, Paris, 12th: Briand's coffin has been carried to the Bashi Cemetery today. The pallbearers are the most distinguished people of the time. Later, the coffin will be reburied in Briand's hometown of Cocherel in Normandy. France has never bestowed such a grand state funeral on a hero as it has bestowed on Briand today. Although Briand completed the separation of church and state during his lifetime, he ultimately enjoyed the reputation of a creator of world peace, so the church still respects him. Today, the coffin was covered with black silk and placed in the conference room of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where Briand had sat during his lifetime. The solemn religious ceremony was performed by Verdi, the Archbishop of Paris. President Doumer and the leaders of the government were all present. The coffin was then carried to the courtyard, where Prime Minister Tardieu delivered a speech praising Briand's achievements during his lifetime. In addition to President Doumer, the pallbearers included British Ambassador Tyrrell representing the British King, Japanese Ambassador Sato representing the Japanese Emperor, and a large contingent of foreign cabinet members. Sir Simon, the most influential British representative in the League of Nations, and Sir Chamberlain, Briand's old friend, were also among them. The coffin was carried onto the hearse by eight retired soldiers, and 300 retired soldiers and a military band accompanied the procession. The procession passed through the Arc de Triomphe, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and all along the way, the spectators were packed like mountains and seas.</p>
<p>Important News from Japan</p>
<h3 id="e93">Financial Situation Changes Drastically <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Due to Sharp Decrease in Deposits and Increase in Loans</p>
<p>Plan to Sell All Securities to Maintain Stability</p>
<p>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun: Since last week, the uneasy atmosphere in the Tokyo financial market has become particularly strong. Not to mention second- and third-tier banks, even powerful first-tier banks have suddenly shown signs of instability. This is because the need for temporary funds due to special circumstances has suddenly increased. On the other hand, due to the inability to transfer transactions, the overnight rate has been rising day by day. The total amount of loans from the Bank of Japan (national bank) on the 5th of this month reached 148.4 million yuan, which is a rare phenomenon since the financial panic. According to the Hochi Shimbun, due to the drastic changes in the financial situation, bank deposits have decreased accordingly. Although bank executives have tried to counter this by raising interest rates to prevent withdrawals, recovering loans, or disposing of all securities to maintain cash, it is feared that, in practice, it will not be possible to prevent the trend of decreasing deposits by raising interest rates alone. It is even more ideal to seek the recovery of loans, because today's business and finance are already in a state of extreme congestion, and judging from the actual situation of various banks over the years, it is not easy to do. Therefore, there is no other option but to sell all the securities at once to enrich the capital. According to the Tokyo Bankers' Club, the amount of deposits is currently only 1,966,341,000 yuan, which is a decrease of 139,231,000 yuan compared to the end of December last year. The Bank of Japan's ordinary deposits are only 62,646,000 yuan. According to the Bank of Japan's accounts, as of the 3rd of this month, loans reached 916.94 million yuan, while the amount of convertible banknotes issued was 1,789.3 million yuan. It is feared that it will not be possible to ease such an expanding trend in a short period of time. In addition, the government has not yet established a financial policy, which has led to the stagnation of various cases due to the drastic changes in finance.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Tianjin's Kneeling and Crying Delegation <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Wearing Mourning Clothes and Holding Funeral Sticks to Awaken the Treacherous Merchants</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Worth Over One Million Yuan Arrived in Tianjin in Two Weeks</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The City Merchants' National Salvation Association recently organized a kneeling and crying delegation to awaken treacherous merchants who are willing to sell Japanese goods. The delegation departed at 8:00 AM on the 5th, led by Liu Zhitian, Nian Guangyao, Cui Yongan, Song Zhaoyi, and others, with more than 40 members wearing mourning clothes and carrying wooden clappers to awaken the public. They first went to the Longchang Seafood Store outside the North Gate to inquire about whether there were any new batches of Japanese goods. The manager of the store, Zhao (a former member of the standing committee of the Merchants' Economic Disconnection Association), was extremely rude and denied transporting Japanese goods. They immediately asked him to write a sworn statement to prove it, but Zhao refused to comply and threatened to "close the door and not do business." As a result, after Liu and others explained the importance of the situation, he agreed. When they were persuading him, many people watched and were greatly moved. They then went to Zhugan Lane and Needle Market Street to persuade merchants, which went quite smoothly. The Longshunrong Pharmacy even presented the delegation with the congratulatory message "Respectfully wishing your delegation success." However, the three cotton yarn shops of Tongshengyi Feng and Ruizhengsheng made things difficult, but after kneeling and crying once, they each gave in and complied, signing a statement proving that they would no longer buy or sell Japanese goods. They then carried out persuasion along North Malu Road. After reaching the Guan Yin Hao, they turned back to the Merchants' National Salvation Association to rest. It was already past 1:00 PM. On that day, a total of 42 merchants had sworn an oath.</p>
<p>At 8:30 AM on the morning of the 6th, the delegation continued to depart, heading directly to Guodian Street, Dan Street, Old Clothes Street to outside the North Gate, turning to Houjiahou and other places, kneeling and crying to persuade the merchants who wholesale Japanese goods, and ordered them to each write a sworn statement not to wholesale enemy goods. When the managers of the merchants saw the kneeling and crying delegation arriving, they immediately signed and handed over the written sworn statements. However, the Yuan Fengyong Seafood Store on the west side of North Gate Road and the Da Mao Foreign Goods Store on Old Clothes Street closed their doors and windows in advance when they saw the kneeling and crying delegation arrive, and refused to swear an oath. After the delegation kneeled and cried once and tried hard to beat the wooden clappers, and with the repeated assistance of the police, the two stores finally gave in and complied. On that day, a total of 64 merchants had sworn an oath.</p>
<p>On the 7th, the delegation was still scheduled to depart, but Wang Yimin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, believed that local unrest and security issues were important. The kneeling and crying delegation went to various merchants to persuade them not to sell Japanese goods in the future, which was originally a very legitimate patriotic movement, but fearing that unscrupulous people would take the opportunity to cause trouble, he specially instructed his subordinates to strictly dissuade the delegation in order to protect the local area, so the delegation also stopped working.</p>
<p>It is heard that between February 11 and 29, a total of eight Japanese ships entered Tianjin, with more than 48,000 pieces of Japanese goods, worth about more than one million yuan. The popularity of Japanese goods in North China can be seen. (7th)</p>

Recently, Wang, with the nation in distress, was quite moved by patriotic thoughts, so he disregarded all sacrifices and was willing to surrender to Liu Guitang to be reorganized, vowing to be a pioneer in the campaign to punish Japan. On the 5th, he entrusted the intermediary Zhai Zuqi to transfer to Liu Guitang's representative Xia Ziming to express his feelings to the provincial government and ask whether he should be reorganized by Liu Guitang. It is heard that the bandit leader is from a Xiajin official family and graduated from Dongchang Provincial No. 2 Middle School. His father was once the captain of the Xiajin County Police Force, but was framed, so he joined the Green Forest Society in order to avenge his father. Later, because his father's revenge had been avenged, he thought of abandoning</p>
<p>darkness and turning to light. It is heard that Xia Ziming visited Han Fuqu yesterday to ask for instructions, and Han has already agreed to let Liu Guitang incorporate Wang's troops.</p>
