<h3 id="c1">好戰之危機·又·玄 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>東北三省豈僅爲遠東之巴爾幹。以目前形勢論實不愧爲世界之大火藥庫。世界各國爲彌縫其内在矛盾起見。正努力於和平運動。洛桑會議。也軍縮會議也。國聯調查團也。在在皆顯示其和平傾向。而同時競爭軍備。製造劇烈之新戰器。飛行機潛水艦亦空前猛進。其間尤以日本爲甚。試舉一二事實以證明其無訛。</p>
<p>（一）日本增加預算。在貨幣膨脹政策之下。一般物價。均因貨幣價値低落而增高。其國家預算。當亦不免於膨脹。然而日本現時情形。則大異於是。一般預算。行政費增加之數目甚微。（僅外債一項。因外匯低落之故。必須增加。）其他各費亦少變動。其預算總額所以達二十四萬萬日金以上者。蓋因陸軍預算計已達五萬萬五千餘萬日金。海軍例較陸軍爲多。以往例推。之至少不下六萬萬日金。僅以其陸海軍費計算。已超過其國費總支出百分之五十。苟再溯諸往事。在一九二九年。日本陸海軍預算實數爲四萬萬八千萬元。占總支出百分之二十八又六。一九三0年。陸海軍預算實數爲四萬萬七千一百萬元。占總支出百分之二十九又三。一九三一年。陸海軍預算實數爲三萬萬九千七百萬元。占總支出百分之二十六又七。一九三二年。陸海軍預算實數爲四萬萬五千六百萬元。占總支出百分之三十。再加侵華軍費一萬萬五千萬元。則陸海軍費已達六萬萬零六百萬元。占總支出百分之三十六有奇。即此。軍費之大已超越戰前之德意志。軍費額之巨。駕乎現代各國而過之矣。不意來年（一九三三年）度預算陸海軍費。竟至十萬萬元以上。其軍費之龐大如此。實破世界新記錄。誠無異乎。戰時預算至少亦可稱爲準戰時預算。</p>
<p>（二）加緊製造軍器。自本年一二八事變以後。日本即大量輸入棉花。及其他各種軍需用品。歐洲各國均驚詫「軍事景氣」之再來。迄至近日製造軍器之徵象愈益顯露。以吳海軍工廠而論。該廠爲日海軍製造四大廠之一。集造砲·水雷·造船·製鋼·電氣·等於統一指揮之下。日夜不停。僅九月上半月。即增加熟練工人約近千名。晝夜加工。如以三個月來增加工人總數計之。當在三千人以上。其次廣島海軍工廠爲海軍之飛機製造廠。近亦招募新工。九月上半月亦增加百餘工人。日夜趕造飛機。私人之飛機製廠。如三菱航空製作所等亦加夜工。其他各廠。均一律加工。其製造費總計。較前年增加約三倍。此即因日本飛機數量質量。不僅遠遜美國。且不及蘇聯。故日夜製造。用爭一日之長也。</p>
<p>準此兩項。雖若甚細。然急於備戰之情形。已暴露而不可掩飾矣。由此更可推知日美關係之將愈趨惡化。日本軍閥誠皆興高彩烈。祝其「大陸政策」之邁進。同時更將獨攬太平洋覇權。遂其十年一戰之傳統的軍事政策。西併中國。北侵西比利亞。然而世事多變。其實果能如是簡單。而一如日本軍閥之意乎。列强關係。美日衝突。蘇日對立。與夫中日間之糾紛等外來困難。且留待後論。僅以日本自身情勢而觀。恐此種積極侵略政策。亦徒爲軍國主義之幻影耳。茲試述一二如左。</p>
<p>第一爲農村經濟勢將崩潰也。農人約有全日本人口總數百分之六十。而每户農人平均負債。在一千一百五十圓日金以上。農村生活。幾將返還原始時代狀况。債旣無法償還。生活更無從改善。租稅之繳納。尤多滯遲。且漸有無力繳納之虞。雖政府方面曾多方設計以救濟農村。而其實惠及於小民者無幾。農民旣如此困窮。其軍閥立國之基礎能穏固乎。</p>
<p>第二爲中小工商業者之瀕於破產也。日本之經濟現勢。雖已到達金融資本階段。而其立國之主要工業。則爲生絲及棉製品。現時美國受經濟恐慌影響。購買力低落。加以政治原因。則生絲前途。將受絶大打擊。（目前生絲市價高漲。係貨幣膨脹政策外匯低落之一時現象。）中日在此對立之情勢下。棉製品在中國恐亦不免受中國產業興起之影響。故日本中小商工業者。勢必難於維持其現狀。</p>
<p>是則最大多數之人民。受病已深。無法挽救。乃日本軍國主義者。又復竭其民力。以從事於純消費的軍事工業之擴大。縱使刮盡骨血。亦豈能滿足拓殖無底之慾念。此不僅與有關係之各國人士爲日本慮。即彼日本朝野之有識。者亦恒自認爲隠。憂特軍閥尙不自覺耳。</p>

<p>這次因爲黃紹雄陳公博兩位先生的邀請、由上海到南京去作一個募捐網球賽、票價收入悉數滙𦔳東北義勇軍、所以道章、兆佳、德光寶華、飛海、同着記者、一行六人、便在星期五那天夜車赴京、在京表演、雖然祇有短短兩日的光陰、但當時的情形、頗有幾件値得回味的、現在因爲邱·林·鄭·江·梁諸友所囑、便在行色怱忙之中、（編者按孫君已於日前赴海州高就）拉雜的寫在下面、</p>
<p>我們是夜十一點快車去的、第二天七點半到了南京、馮建剛君等已經在車站等候、相見之下、便同乘車到勵志社、休息一會、馮君便徵求我們意見先洗澡還是先吃飯、阿佳（兆佳）的肚皮已經整整的餓了一夜、不等我們的回答、連忙搶住說、「還是先用飯吧、」我們便在相視而笑之下、已走進飯堂、阿佳一句話也不說、祇顧低下頭狼吞虎咽、一轉眼間、四個鷄蛋、兩盤火腿、已風捲殘雲一點不剩了再要加時、我們說「阿佳、今早還要打球呵、」阿佳的刀义雖然放下了、却鼓足兩片腮兒、向我們睹氣、</p>
<p>十時許在勵志社球場練習了一會、下午二時便正式開賽了、臨時定的秩序、是德光對記者的單打、寶華兆佳對飛海道章的雙打、然後再由寶華德光對京市名手凌道揚馬慶禧二君雙打、單打結果是、</p>
<p>梁德光七比五四比六孫麟方(各勝一盤)</p>
<p>德光本是香港硬地網球名將、記者素來也最喜打硬地、所以在勵志社硬地打起來、如快朶願、十分過癮、第一雙打的結果是、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳林寶華八十江道章六一邱飛海和局</p>
<p>第一盤林鄭配搭、無懈可乘、有時且小計略施、使對方不及措手、第二盤開始、邱江怱然大顯神通、奇兵迭出、所以兩盤劇戰結果、一與一之比、打成平手、此戰精彩百出博得彩聲不少、第二雙打的結果是、</p>
<p>梁德光林寶華六三馬慶禧六二凌道揚林梁勝</p>
<p>凌通揚君現在已經是四十多的人、尙能孜孜不倦的、在球塲上角逐、誠然的、老當益壯、洵足爲後進者模範、馬君球藝、亦多可取、不過乍遇寶華德光自不得不稍拜下風了、</p>
<p>賽完、天色快黑了勵志社、總幹事黃仁霖君、請我們吃晚飯、席間除了我們六人外、尙有上海唱歌團團員諸君、濟濟一堂談笑甚歡散後、又以馮君、余君、陳君、聯合會請在萬國俱樂部茶叙、在那裹、我們會見了許多海外締交朋友、我們舊話連篇、一直講了兩點多鐘纔珍重而别、</p>
<p>回勵志社的時候、我們車子先開的不想我們到了好久、他們的車子影兒不見、我們房間的分配、寶華和兆佳是在一間的、鑰匙却携在寶華的身上、寶華還未到、兆佳已經睡興大發、但是鐵將軍當關、不得其門而入、急的光佳如同熱鍋上螞蟻一樣、東撞西撞、終於等的不耐煩、倒在阿梁的床上睡了、我們也因爲太倦、所以也將要走入睡鄉、忽然遠遠的聽見、寶華一路阿佳阿佳的呌上樓來、我們一問之下、纔曉得他們半天没有來的原因、是因爲車子在僻靜之處、出了毛病、整整的修理了好一會、纔開來的、正和阿佳一樣、兩兩相對的「急然噲」啊、哈哈、</p>
<p>夜裹睡的倒很栝靜、不過Taul（道章）的呼聲、雷一般哼哈着、常常會使我們莫明其妙的、睜開眼、向他看上幾看</p>

<p>昨日銀行買胃、晨間已經有軟弱之勢、祗以供給方面、鑒於此次釐價漲風之暴、多頭類都獲利、紛紛脫手、更因天津帮適以昨日來電止裝、兩難相併、以致市氣大變、與日前値反比例、其間經過漲跌之狂驟、雖戰事期間、殆無是過、可見市面雖挺、而人心究若警弓之鳥、禁不起大風浪耳、就記者管見所及大槪還是好面、綠津帮雖已停裝、而其他各埠依然絡繹不絶、尙有大好希望、能使其實現焉、</p>

<p>公共租界工部局、因界内開映之電影、現時雖經檢查、而應予考慮之點尙多、特於本年四月間、延聘堪南君Mrs·A·M·Cannao寇爾曼君Mrs·P·C·Colman與倫克理夫人、Mrs·A·E·Lunkley組織一調查委員會、以研究管理電影及檢查電影之問題、該委員會、業經開會十五次、並召集證人多人、詢問一切、又曾審閱各方建議、參考他處方法、刻已調查完畢、繕具報告書、送交工部局、局中收到後、對於該委員等之辛勤工作、已表示謝意、該報告書篇幅頗多、茲節述其要點如次、</p>
<p>▲現行制度之缺限　查電影檢查之目的、本非欲問該片内容價値之如何而只問其是否宜於在本地公映、現行辦法檢查之職、由警務處人員執行、辦理尙佳、但低級之警員負此責任、未免太重、而工作亦甚緊、（每月平均檢查長片五十種、短片四十種左右、）雖有「國際檢查委員會」但與警處檢查員殊鮮聯絡、預映之時、每無委員出席、蓋因委員人數太多、散漫無力、</p>
<p>▲建議另組委員會　調查委員會主張、應另組一正式有力量之委員會其組織、爲公共租界及法租界高級警官各一員、領事團之代表一員、婦女各公團合推一員、兩租界各另派會員一員、（最好爲法律或醫學或敎育人員）必要時、再加聘專家、初步　檢查、由兩租界警務處派員爲之、（兩租界必須通力合作、開映准否之權須操之於兩警務處長、每次預映時、除警處檢查員外、應由委員會委員一人出席、如該員不贊同警員之决斷、得令將此片送委員會重審、委員會審定之簽字證書、應於開演時映出、至於委員任期至少應爲一年、除局員兼任者外、其工作應予以報酬、調查委員會並建議、由工部局自設一映演室、以免檢查員奔走之煩此室設備、約需六萬兩、但其經費、可略微娛樂捐、或收手續費充之、</p>
<p>▲民族感情應顧慮　調查委員會認爲檢查之標準難、定嚴格之章程、但上海五方雜處、對於民族感情之關係應特别注意、又對於影片有引起東方人輕視西洋人、或使西洋人輕視東方人者、皆須鄭重考慮之、</p>
<p>▲影片對靑年影響　調查委員會查得、盜匪一種之影片、對兒童之影響、不甚顯著、但描寫肉感之片、爲害甚大、華人學生階級、甚受其影響、故主張將影片分爲兩類、一種標以U字、可供一切人觀看、一種標以A字、則只備成年之人觀看、至於年齡標準、似亦可以十六歲爲界限、</p>
<p>▲圖畫廣告應改革　現今影戱院在路旁所張之巨幅圖畫廣告、往往描慕過甚、且多不甚雅觀、雖戱院方面、先以廣告之縮影交檢查員閱看、但大小之間、印像逈異、調查委員會建議、令各劇院將圖畫廣告一律停止、而專用文字廣告至少先試行若干時、以觀其是否影響於視衆之數目、又報紙上之廣告、亦可一律將圖畫取消、</p>
<p>▲提高影片之内容　影片之價値、非檢查員所宜過問、查美國有一婦女俱樂部之聯合會、每月出版一種影片報告、足以指示何者不宜於兒童視看、何者宜於閱看、此法如上海倣行、積久必有效力、又澳洲辦法、凡任分發影片之業者、均須註册、如其違章、可將其執照吊銷、又現今存上海所映之敎育性質影片爲數極少、調查委員會、以爲如將此種片作爲短片、映於新聞片及主片之間、於兒童極有益也、</p>
<p>報告書附錄中、有影片聯合會代表克理斯爾及韓納之意見書、謂工部局在法律上無權施行檢查、且局中對於戱劇及出版物亦向不檢查云、</p>

<p>▲救起搭客二百餘人</p>
<p>▲溺死者約八十餘各</p>
<p>本埠南市大運輪公司之崇明班輪大運號、昨晨由崇開來上海、行至堡鎭港、全船傾覆、旅客之溺斃水中者近百、記者特往該公司、切實調查、茲將失事等情、分記如後、</p>
<p>▲輕重倒置　大運輪于昨晨七時、從崇明開出、在南門港裝有棉花六百件、係運赴堡鎭港之大通紗廠者、故該花衣乃裝在船面上、而船内各艙、轉無貨物載運、僅僅搭乘三百餘名旅客、該輪遂成輕重倒置之勢、而船面反較船身爲重矣、查大運輪由崇經二條竪·新開河·至堡鎭港靠泊、正値上午九時二十分、該輪方在抛錨停泊之際、不謂受潮流之擊衝、而至全船傾覆、釀成絶大慘劇、</p>
<p>▲船身横倒　大運輪靠停堡鎭港碼頭、爲九時二十五分、其船後尾之纜繩已經帶就、旅客之上陸者、亦從各艙趨出、同到左側甲板、準備登岸、詎意此際正値潮水激漲之時、向内傾側、適被潮流冲打、致使大運輪、突然間向碼頭横倒下來霎時全身傾覆、横臥江面、船内物件之跌落港内者甚多</p>
<p>▲旅客落水　大運倒覆時、後尾之纜未斷、其船上之烟囱初時擱在碼頭上、致船身平臥港面、全船旅客、計由南門港下船者八十餘人、二條竪下輪者四十餘、新開河下船者五十餘、共總約三百名左右、其中有一部分已經至甲板者、在船翻之時、亦盡行落水、當塲除在倒輪時、躍登碼頭之船員水手乘客外、其落水者、至少有二百七八十人、</p>
<p>▲救起一部　從甲板上跌落水内者、多係靠近碼頭、故易於救護、當場由碼頭邊之小民船等起出一百餘人、其時適有同班來滬之甬舟號輪、亦到堡鎭港、目覩大運傾覆、甬舟船主龐燦林、急放舢板、協助救護、當撈獲落水之客二十餘人、又有行風船一艘、亦救起三十餘人、大運輪之划子船上、又撈救三十餘人、據龐燦林語記者、渠眼見救出之搭客、約有二百一二十名、最後甬舟輪、又從港内撈獲乘客徐正福等兩名、並衣箱一隻、該衣箱現帶至上海、候人認領、</p>
<p>▲死傷數目　大運輪中之搭客、未經救起者尙多、蓋該輪倒覆之後、便向外擋移動、船體横没水内、烟囱亦沉水中、其在艙内之旅客、不及逃至外邊者、多陷没在船内、蓋船内各艙門均倒閉、無法啓開、此輩沉閉輪内之人、勢必全數死亡、現在公司方面、尙無實數報告、但據目覩者言、估計溺死在船内、及水中之船員與搭客、當在七八十名左右、甬舟輪開滬時、猶見遭難者、在船中透風洞内、探出一頭、大聲求救、惜無法使之出外也、哀哉、</p>
<p>▲派輪救護　昨日下午三時、上海大運公司始得該輪失事之電報、而電文甚簡、僅言大運由崇裝棉六百、到堡鎭横倒失事云云、公司得信、立即由協理杜少時親自乘本公司之大連號輪、駛往堡鎭港視察、並籌議救護方法、據該公司陸君語記者、詳細情形、須在今晨四時、候杜君返滬、或可得到矣、</p>
<p>▲船體入水　甬舟輪在上午十一時許、離開堡鎭港、見大運輪已經横倒港内後、尾纜仍舊帶住、船頭向東南、船尾朝西北、距碼頭約計五六丈、大運之前身尙横露水面約計三尺、而船後尾已没入水中不見、查大運輪爲永裕公司一九二一年所造、載重二百八七噸、排水量三百十一噸、船身長一百四十二尺、闊二十五尺吃水七尺四寸、引擎係兩聯式、發動機有四百匹馬力、</p>
<p>▲損失槪况　此次大運輪中、僅有六百件棉花、船内貨物無多、惟船内旅客船員等行李物件、悉皆沉失、故連船身之損失、亦在六七萬元、該輪並未保險、船主楊阿三·大副陳雲龍·二副洪福生·等、聞均已逃出、現在堡鎭港、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語録</p>
<h3 id="c208">一戴巴黎帽便可充紳士 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— ·景·記</p>
<p>相老人主張國定制服，男短女長，原料可用絲麻改良的織物。下面便是說的理由：|</p>
<p>「穿衣是人生不可少的一件事：可惜我們太不講究。稍稍加以整頓，便能得一種社會上通行的制服。</p>
<p>因爲衣服的好壞，不是質料問題；還是時尙問題。一旦成爲通行式的衣着，再没有人討論它的好壞了。你想是不是？」</p>
<p>我就答應，接着說了：『我從前在北京師大時，穿得淺綠色的學生制服，式樣質料都壞得很，連郵差穿着的都不如；可是大家都很高興穿起來；因爲校外人一望而知爲最高敎育學府中人！</p>
<p>』</p>
<p>相老人點點頭，還微笑，又往下再說了：</p>
<p>『因此，我主張劃一服裝的問題，更能成立了！最好國定，男短女長。我國絲麻的出產品非常多，讓專家來研究，做成衣料；這麽一來，國服又能推銷國貨，不是一舉兩得麽？』</p>
<p>過些日子，有客來了，談到這問題，相老人除重述了他的主張和理由，又說了一個小掌故：|</p>
<p>『意大利人，多穿絲貨：因爲他們也能出產不少的絲。可是外國人，講究時髦的，要仿傚法國人。有一次，來了一位，來訪問我，拿帽子脫下來了，告訴這是巴黎帽：證明他是一位紳士呢！何以一戴巴黎帽，便可充紳士呢？大家猜罷！』</p>

<p>一二八滬變，上海市童子軍理事會，本着童子軍的精神組織戰地服務隊，實行深入槍林彈雨裹面去討生活，不久因了戰地遼闊，同志們不夠支配，於是臨時訓練了一批健兒，中間有位王抗夫同志，也是後入的生力軍之一，起先把他派到收容所，後來，又派他到交通處的傳遞股；這位抗夫同志，他的工作着實驚人！往來嘉定·南翔·上海·瀏河·都比較其他同志，行駛的迅速一些，他並没有特異之點，他駕駛自收車，如風馳電掣，大家騎馬揚鞭，他也跟着追逐，大家共被同臥，他也不瞻顧遲疑，有時同志們辛苦了，肌體上汚濁了，邀他到市鎭上澡堂裹面淴一回浴，他也很大方的答應着，可是敎他實行去洗浴，他就推却不去了。</p>
<p>事隔半年，相聚了三個月的王抗夫同志最近纔知道他是易釵而異，和伊同道的某君告訴我，據他的回憶，王抗夫並没絲毫女性的形跡，最顯著生理上的變態，伊的乳房和男子一般，伊的舉止，純是道地，的鬚眉氣慨；伊現在居然有了戀人，且將宣告實行同居之愛，伊的芳年纔二十有一，伊的籍貫大約是嘉湖一帶人士，伊的這回秘密行徑，只好說古有花木蘭，今有王抗夫了。</p>

<p>正在那時，AB好似哥侖布發現新大陸一般的欣喜；因爲伊們覺到C的紅而油膩的嘴唇，悟到饅頭的所以會紅。伊們便向C使了個眼色，於是紅潮暈滿了C的雙頰，就這樣地起出了那家饅頭店。|這眞是：「天下本無事，庸人自擾之」</p>

<p>這「終身幸福」一句話，似一　利箭直射進魯伯勤的心坎，　然從身上打了個大寒噤，把眼前的昏瞀的狀態震醒了。腦經上立刻回復了淸明，想起昨晚所决定的主見，是極端的正當，决不能因此時的迷惑而稍有動搖與改變。便連忙鼓足一股勇氣，下一番克己的工夫，把一些打好了腹稿的句子，盡量傾吐：</p>
<p>「對不住我今天的答復，怕不能使你滿意呢。」</p>
<p>佟一貞勃然變色；他也忙將眼臉垂閉下，一口氣說到底道：「我已考量得很週到，你所提議的那種解放的方法，我實是不能贊同。因爲那樣冒冒失失一同逃跑，將來一定發生不幸的結果，并貽留後悔於無窮的。你想呀！我們都很年輕，没有多大的能力，我除了在此地郵局幹一分小事，到别處去便恐怕不能另找到相當的職業，你我出走後的家庭生活問題，就會把我們陷到僵境。我承你剖心瀝瞻的見愛，固是任何犧牧，皆所不辭。但遇事應當以你的幸福爲前提；這樣子不會使你將來有幸福，而且還會使你精神上身體上與名譽上都得受無窮的痛苦與損害，我那能不加顧慮的就冒失去做。一貞我愛你，便不能害你，我這點苦心，你應該諒解的啊。」</p>
<p>佟一貞聽得不能再忍耐了。奪眶而出的淚珠兒，滿佈在因失望而悲憤慘沮的面容上。冷不防搶遇了那把傘，立起來就走；惟在背着臉的當見兒，說出那樣有剌的話：</p>
<p>「我不高興聽你講了。什麽是爲我的幸福着想？却甘願讓我給别人作什麽五姨太太，難道那就是我的大幸福嗎？我明白，你是没有現代靑年人的革命精神，不敢爲愛情冒險，又捨不得犧牲郵政局那個小飯碗，就忍心不管我的事，你是太怯懦了啊！」</p>
<p>魯伯勒嚇得趕忙緊追上去，伊又回遇頭來啐了一口：道「豈只是怯懦，我簡直還要駡你是卑怯。也算是我佟一貞瞎了眼，認錯了人，妄想拏你這卑怯的東西，當做可倚托的愛人。如今可是看透了你啦；一切也不必再談啦；從此誰也不要管誰，誰也不要再認識誰，各幹各的好了。」</p>

<p>任何政治家，任何軍事家，或任何主義的政制，一到中國，總是無辦法，弄不好，「瘋癆臌膈，」四者都是不治之症，中國之病，原是四者兼備，故請任何著名醫生來診治，開遍藥方，多不見效，祇有束手待斃，非請華陀呂純陽等大仙來診治不可，</p>
<p>中國本是多神之國，神道設敎，原是治國第一件根本大法，封神榜西游記等書，本爲我國立國寶鑑，姜子牙·劉伯溫·王禪老祖·白娘娘·紅線·聶隠娘等，原爲我國歷史上代表人物，現在我國雖弄得内憂外患，不堪收拾，只要那一位大仙，偶犯天讉，謫落人世，或俗綠未盡，墮落紅塵，則我國的救星就到，</p>
<p>佛法無邊，神通廣大，孫行者翻了幾十個觔斗，還是逃不出如來五指，自古匈奴·突厥·女眞·契丹·諸蠻夷，何等厲害，一到中國，完全同化，亦是佛法無邊的一個徵象，日本雖然暴横，妄作妄爲，亦决逃不了如來陰陽押指一算之中，</p>

<p>現在開時輪法會，諸大菩薩，必然降臨，啓大智慧，轉大法輪，必定能將一切魑魅魍魎，妖精息怪，一一降服壇下，旣有佛法無邊神通廣大的息災道塲，必有意想不到的效力，我輩請拭目俟之</p>

<p>— ·枕</p>
<p>石膏製像係利用燒石膏吸水結合之性質而製成，平常結晶體石膏含有二分子結晶水，（CaSO5　2H2O）燒至相當時問，則失去一分子結晶水而成燒石膏，（CaSO4H2O）加水調和後，約經十五分鐘，即乾燥成白色固塊，能施以種種彫刻，欲製石膏像之前，必先製成模型。</p>
<p>（一）製模型法製模型須先將原物（如欲製洋囝之模型原物即爲洋囝）週體塗以半固性油類，如凡士林，或濃厚肥皂水均可，用粘土揑成長條，高度與欲製模型之厚薄相等，乃將泥條圍於原物之側緣，然後用水將石膏調成厚糊狀，塡滿泥條所圍之任何一面，待石膏乾後即撤去泥條，石膏則附着於原物上，用手扳之即下，在石膏邊緣隔相當距離掘一小方缺口，邊緣及缺口内皆塗以油，合於原處，再調石膏塡於另一面，第二塊模型之製成，有一突出部分與前一塊模型之小缺口相符合，如此做成之後，即可澆製石膏像或澆製臘像，澆製石膏像之模型，此係最簡單者之製法，如遇物體之凹凸不均及富有曲線者，即不適用，故製石膏像之模型有多至十餘塊者，製像時得將模型相合，用繩索縛緊，由模型底部通以適當大小之孔，灌入石膏，普通澆臘像之模型，則皆僅二塊合成，且無須較大之孔，僅一能容鵝毛管之孔已足。</p>
<p>（二）製石膏像法將燒石膏調成薄糊狀，由模型之底部灌入，分量之多寡視模型之大小而異，灌入後將模型旋轉，使模型内部均附着石膏，經二三分鐘即能凝固，乃將模型除下，此時石膏像已成，但模型接合之處，必有凸出之線條，可用小刀削去之，再用木賊草或細砂皮擦過即成。</p>
<p>日久石膏像每每灰暗不堪，切不可用濕物揩擦，須先用乾布拭過，再以木賊草擦過，則潔白如新矣。</p>
<p>（三）製臘像法將臘熱熔，染以各種顏色，傾入模型之下方一塊，即將上方之一塊模型覆上，迅速振蕩之，以寸許長之鵝毛管插入模型之小孔中，用力吹之，速入冷水内，將模型分開，臘像即浮出水面，削去模型合縫之線，補正鵝毛管孔即成完好之臘像。</p>

<p>社會建設在金錢上面，敎育終竟要變商業化了！這種社會病態只好歸咎我們政府不良的應有的結果，假使政府辦理敎育的方法不違反社會主義化的原則，那末，把人民所納的賦稅的一部份儘夠極守美的設備敎育機關和敎育行政，人民到了適當的年齡都人受敎育的權利而政府無時不負着「敎」和「育」的責任，那末，納費的問題自然没了，只爲着政府辦理敎育只會有名無實地敷掩着，把窮苦小百姓的賦稅分配不適當，以致敎授索薪，學生罷課，校長侵吞公欵，政潮操縱學生種種流弊多不勝計，國家敎育不能夠使人民滿意，故繼起便有私立敎育機關的設立，於是納費的問題便產生而糾葛的情形，便發現了，</p>
<p>作私舞弊是因中國長久的歷史的變遷，和廣大的區域的關係，人民積習因循所變成牢不可拔的惡劣民族性，人民的血和汗換得的錢經過政客的手，大錢化小錢而小錢化無錢了，結果辦敎育者更變本加厲，公然營業起來，這種風氣呌貧民如何超拔，呌中國如何富强，本篇所討論的不注意於各項費用應否繳納或繳納的數目多寡的問題，因爲假公濟私的人們斷没「師出無名」的欺詐着，我們所注意的便是納費後的用途，我們所要預防的是納費後的私弊，現在把最重要的辦法說出讓大家評論着，</p>
<p>（一）學校財政公開學校財政不特要會計師淸算，着並且要組織了一個混合的監委會其中人選由社會局代表，學生家長，學校董事，社會名人充任，監委的權限是審查預算表，稽核財政，告發營私舞弊的人們，那末學校的財政已經受全社會監視着，而濫開浪費的習慣便可以除掉了，</p>
<p>（二）學校收入的金錢的用途應以消費合作爲原則，斷不可從中取利着，如果經濟不充裕，何妨縮小範圍，務取其實際而不可貪心虚名，譬如膳費，書籍代售，宿費，圖書館，實騐費，體育費等應該有學生的代表參加合作同時監視着，他們的義務是要隨時將其中情形公佈，高中以上學生纔要選派代表資格，初中小學的學校則由學校當局每月報告校監委會並由校監委會派員隨時明稽暗探着，</p>
<p>（三）各大中小學的費用的標準，應先由敎育專家研究着規定着，以敎育平民化爲目的，以後各個學校可以隨地稍加以改變，國　學校每月有政府津貼費，</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>故學生的擔負自然减輕，而私立的擔負比較重些但，求所出的金錢不入少數人的私囊，便算萬幸了，至於享受政府的「敎」和「育」的權利，我們小百姓只好禱祝着，期望着。</p>
<p>總之敎育用費有平民化的標準，用法的原則根據消費合作，而用費的時候，受全社會監視着，納費的問題自然迎刃而解，而營利敎育的機關將也自歸淘汰，更不用我們嘵舌了。</p>

<p>『！唔還好，先生！』</p>
<p>『你姓？你大約有十三四歲吧？』</p>
<p>『不，我已經十六歲哩。先生，我呌阿根，是姓王。』</p>
<p>『呀！阿根，看你是很年靑的，你那裹有十六七歲的樣子。』</p>
<p>『我是不能當一船人來相看，因爲一般人的生活環境大都是美滿愉快，吃的好，穿的好，體材自然發展得快些：像我生來命苦，自幼就談不到營養和保護，而且還要做苦工，自然發育不能健全，長成這樣矮小身段，眞是「吃得大不得，」哈哈！先生請勿取笑，我是個不撤謊的孩子！』同時他把挑着的兩桶泥放下，直握着扁擔，似乎等待我還有什麽回響。</p>
<p>『你的爹媽幹的什麽？』</p>
<p>『唉！爸爸也做泥匠，不幸前年替沈家老爺蓋屋，偶而失足，便從五樓跌下，腦槳四濺，頓時氣絶。媽媽做補綴度活的生意。那，還在那裹替工友們正在補着衣服哩！』阿根手指着坐在對過樹蔭下的一只小板橙上操鍼不息的婦人，那婦人懷抱着一個頭大頸子細哭聲唏噓的嬰孩，正在吮吸着她的乳頭。阿根復又輕言婉語的說：『媽媽懷抱的嬰孩，就是我的小弟弟，他是遺腹子，他還多病愛哭，他那裹知道他是未出娘身而即喪失了父親的一個可憐的孤子！』</p>
<p>『噢！眞可憐！你爸爸的身後是怎樣辦呢？』</p>
<p>『先生，提起此事，要算爸爸在生做人好，才有他的工友，也是我的司務，極力向沈老爺請求，總算得到一百五十只老洋才了局，又承我師務憐憫我們寡母孤兒，把我當做大工看待，雖然工作有些吃不下去，但是咬緊牙關，努力掙扎，却也不覺得甚麽』</p>
<p>『你有多少工鈿一天呢？』</p>
<p>『四角洋鈿，飯吃公上呢，小菜吃自家呢；這還算是大工呢！』</p>
<p>『㕭㕭！原來大工只有四角洋鈿。』</p>
<p>『先生，請看，他們整天捶石篩土，或者搬運重物的小工，一天「杭育」「杭育」的狂呌到晚，每人只有兩只角子。』他指着一羣前呼後應，正在做着重贅活計的人說。同時他的面孔上似乎浮出「比下有餘」「差足自慰」的一種微笑。　　『勞工神聖，却也不錯，阿根，我很欣羨你，這大就能自食其力，我也想來做工，你能替我設法一席大工嗎？』</p>
<p>『哈哈！你那裹比得我們窮人，應當做工造屋：這裹造好造那裹，可是自己苦到老，還没有房屋住，先生不可憐我們，還要來開什麽玩笑嗎？』</p>
<p>阿根擔起了泥桶飛也似的拾級而登屋頂去了。我雖不得再和他繼續的談話，但却引起一個疑問：造房子的是一層人，住房子的又另一層人，小孩說的話却有幾分道理，但是社會造成這樣令人不平的事，究竟是「伊誰之咎？」</p>

<p>Isn't the Northeast Three Provinces just the Balkans of the Far East? Given the current situation, it truly deserves to be called the world's powder keg. Countries around the world, in order to resolve their internal contradictions, are diligently pursuing peace movements. The Lausanne Conference, the Disarmament Conference, the League of Nations Inquiry, all these show a tendency toward peace. But at the same time, they are competing in armaments and manufacturing fierce new weapons. There is unprecedented progress in airplanes and submarines. Japan is particularly prominent in this regard. Let me cite a few facts to prove that this is true.</p>
<p>(1) Japan's increased budget. Under the policy of monetary inflation, general prices have increased due to the depreciation of currency. The national budget will inevitably be inflated as well. However, Japan's current situation is quite different from this. The general budget and the increase in administrative expenses are very small. (Only one item, foreign debt, must be increased due to the decline in foreign exchange.) Other expenses also change very little. The reason why the total budget reaches more than 2.4 billion yen is that the army budget has reached more than 550 million yen. The navy is usually more than the army. Based on past examples, it should be at least no less than 600 million yen. Calculated only on the basis of its army and navy expenditures, it has exceeded 50% of its total national expenditures. If we trace back to the past, in 1929, Japan's actual army and navy budget was 480 million yuan, accounting for 28.6% of the total expenditures. In 1930, the actual army and navy budget was 471.1 million yuan, accounting for 29.3% of the total expenditures. In 1931, the actual army and navy budget was 397.7 million yuan, accounting for 26.7% of the total expenditures. In 1932, the actual army and navy budget was 456.6 million yuan, accounting for 30% of the total expenditures. Adding the 150 million yuan for the invasion of China, the army and navy expenditure has reached 606.6 million yuan, accounting for more than 36% of the total expenditure. In other words, the military expenditure has exceeded that of Germany before the war. The amount of military expenditure is greater than that of any modern country. Unexpectedly, the army and navy expenditure in next year's (1933) budget will reach more than one billion yuan. The huge amount of military expenditure is breaking a new world record. It is no different from a wartime budget, or at least it can be called a quasi-wartime budget.</p>
<p>(2) Intensified manufacturing of weapons. Since the January 28th Incident this year, Japan has imported large quantities of cotton and other military supplies. European countries are amazed by the return of the "military boom." Until recently, the signs of manufacturing weapons have become increasingly obvious. Taking the Wu Naval Factory as an example, the factory is one of the four major manufacturing factories of the Japanese Navy, integrating the manufacture of artillery, mines, shipbuilding, steelmaking, electricity, etc. under unified command. It is working day and night. In the first half of September alone, it added nearly a thousand skilled workers. They are working day and night. If we calculate the total number of workers added in the past three months, it should be more than three thousand. Secondly, the Hiroshima Naval Factory is the navy's aircraft manufacturing factory. Recently, it has also recruited new workers. In the first half of September, it also added more than one hundred workers. They are rushing to manufacture airplanes day and night. Private aircraft manufacturing factories, such as Mitsubishi Aviation Works, etc., are also working overtime. Other factories are processing materials in the same way. The total manufacturing cost has increased by about three times compared with the previous year. This is because the quantity and quality of Japanese airplanes are not only far behind the United States, but also not as good as the Soviet Union. Therefore, they are manufacturing day and night to strive for one day's advantage.</p>
<p>Based on these two points, although they seem very small, the urgency of preparing for war has been exposed and cannot be concealed. From this, we can further infer that the relationship between Japan and the United States will become increasingly worse. The Japanese warlords are all in high spirits, celebrating the advancement of their "Continental Policy." At the same time, they will monopolize the hegemony of the Pacific Ocean and achieve their traditional military policy of fighting a war every ten years, annexing China in the west and invading Siberia in the north. However, things in the world are ever-changing. Can it really be as simple as this, and as the Japanese warlords want it to be? The relations between the powers, the conflict between the United States and Japan, the opposition between the Soviet Union and Japan, and the disputes between China and Japan, and other external difficulties, will be discussed later. Looking only at Japan's own situation, I am afraid that this aggressive policy is just an illusion of militarism. Let me describe one or two points as follows.</p>
<p>The first is that the rural economy is about to collapse. Farmers account for about 60% of the total population of Japan, and the average debt per farmer is more than 1,150 yen. Rural life is almost returning to the state of primitive times. The debt cannot be repaid, and life cannot be improved. The payment of taxes is even more delayed, and there is a danger of being unable to pay. Although the government has designed various ways to rescue the countryside, few of them benefit the common people. If the farmers are so poor, can the foundation of the warlords' country be stable?</p>
<p>The second is that small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises are on the verge of bankruptcy. Although Japan's economic situation has reached the stage of financial capital, its main industries are raw silk and cotton products. At present, the United States is affected by the economic panic, and its purchasing power is declining. In addition, due to political reasons, the future of raw silk will be greatly affected. (The current high price of raw silk is a temporary phenomenon caused by the policy of monetary inflation and the decline in foreign exchange.) Under the current situation of confrontation between China and Japan, cotton products in China will inevitably be affected by the rise of Chinese industry. Therefore, it will be difficult for Japanese small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises to maintain their current status.</p>
<p>Therefore, the vast majority of people are deeply ill and cannot be saved. However, the Japanese militarists are exhausting their people's power to expand the purely consumptive military industry. Even if they scrape off the bone marrow, how can they satisfy the desire to expand without end? This is not only a concern for people of all countries who have relations with Japan, but also a hidden worry for those Japanese people in the government and the public, especially the warlords who are not aware of it.</p>

<p>Both Han and Liu Express Obedience to Central Government Orders</p>
<p>Two Representatives from Military Headquarters Return to Jinan to Report to Jiang Bocheng</p>
<p>Jinan, Noon on the 12th, Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang, along with Liu Zhennian's representative Li Henghua, met for the second time in Shentang. Li Henghua stated that Liu Zhennian absolutely obeys the orders of the Central Government and has ceased all military actions. As for the methods for resolving the aftermath, he will follow the Central Government's orders. Li and Fan, believing that Liu had made a firm statement, decided that it was unnecessary to meet with Liu in the city. They telegraphed the meeting's details to Jiang Bocheng, who will then forward the telegram to the Central Government for instructions. The Shandong issue will soon be resolved. Fan Yuhuang, who was originally scheduled to inspect Laiyang, has now cancelled the trip and will return to Jinan with Li Yue in the next few days to report back to Nanjing. (Central News Agency telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Jinan, Li Yue and Zhang Lianjia returned to Jinan from Shahe at 5:56 PM. Li stated that Liu is absolutely obedient to the Central Government and both sides have ceased military actions. They returned to Jinan to report the progress to Jiang Bocheng, the Chief of General Staff. This morning at 9:00 AM, when they departed from Shahe, Fan Yuhuang, along with Zhang Shouqian, a senator of the provincial government, went to Laiyang for inspection at the same time. Jiang Bocheng stated that according to the results of the negotiations between Li Yue and Liu's representative, Liu expressed that he would absolutely obey any orders from the Central Government. As the Central Government has not yet issued any orders, the three solutions mentioned in the newspapers have not been finalized. Ning Chunxiao's brigade and Huang's regiment of the Shandong Army have arrived in Yantai. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Jinan, Ge Guangting is scheduled to arrive in Jinan early on the 14th and will go to Ping to visit Zhang that evening. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Jinan, Li Yue, due to his extremely successful negotiations with Li Henghua, Liu Zhennian's representative, in Shentang, returned to Weifang on the morning of the 13th by the Jiaoji Railway and arrived in Jinan at 6:00 PM. Zhang Lianjia returned with him. Upon disembarking, he immediately visited Jiang Bocheng to report the negotiation process. Li told reporters that he had two very successful meetings with Liu's representative Li Henghua in Shentang. Liu stated that he would absolutely obey the orders of the Central Government, so he returned to Jinan to visit Jiang Bocheng, the Chief of General Staff, to report and request instructions on everything. Staff Officer Fan Yuhuang, accompanied by Zhang Shouten, a senator of the provincial government, went to Laiyang for inspection on the morning of the 13th. The ceasefire has now been implemented on the front in Yexian County. (Central News Agency telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Jinan, a telegram from Shahe, Li Yue said before leaving that both parties have stopped military actions and are awaiting the central government's resolution. The first step has been successfully achieved and the results of the investigation will be reported to the central government.</p>
<p>Based on this, the central government will plan the second step. The public opinion here is that a peaceful resolution is the highest hope and it will also be reported to the central government for their disposal. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Jinan, the food supply inside Yecheng has been cut off and people are starving to death from time to time. Yesterday, when Li Yue went to see Liu's representative, the Shahe Chamber of Commerce and representatives of the people asked Li to convey to Liu's representative to return to the city and request Liu Zhennian to quickly release the people in the city and the laborers conscripted from various villages and towns, so as to avoid all of them starving to death. Liu's representative, Li Henghua, promised to return to the city to convey the message on his behalf, but he was unwilling to take responsibility and would definitely do his best. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Liu Zhennian telegraphed to Nanjing, stating that Han sent two planes to Yecheng on the 7th to drop more than a hundred bombs, killing and wounding more than a hundred civilians and destroying dozens of houses. Such disobedience to orders is inhumane, and he hopes that the Central Government will quickly stop it. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Yang Lichuan, Liu Zhennian's representative stationed in Nanjing, visited He Yingqin on the 13th to report that the Han army was still besieging Laiyang, Qixia, and Yexian. He requested that the Central Government strictly order the Han army to retreat to their original defenses. As for the transfer of Liu's army to defensive positions, he would also follow the Central Government's orders. He expressed that he would consider it again after Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang, who went to Shandong, reported to Nanjing. The Central Government's essential proposition is that everyone returns to their original defenses. If the Han army does not comply in the near future, the Central Government will again order both sides to comply. If any party does not obey the orders of the Central Government, the Central Government will naturally exercise its authority. Yang Lichuan told people that Han's troops were besieging Laiyang, Qixia, and Muping very urgently. Mr. Liu's division had decided to abandon Muping and Qixia when necessary. However, Yexian is close to the sea, so they must defend it to the death no matter what. The focus of the future battles between the two sides may be here. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, the Nanjing office of the 21st Army received a telegram from Liu Zhennian: (1) Han's troops, Rong Guangxing, Zhao Xinde, and Chen Dexin, etc., launched a three-pronged counterattack on Laiyang and have now advanced to the Songwangzhuang and Dongxi Wujia area, confronting my Laiyang troops. (2) Han's troops, led by Wang's regiment, commanded by Xie Shuxian's approximately 2,000 men, attacked Qixia from Biguojji in Zhaoyuan on the 11th and were repelled by our troops stationed in Qixia and fled towards Zhaoyuan. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, according to military news, Jiang Bocheng negotiated with Han Fuqu and Military and Political Department commissioners Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang in Shandong, and directly telegraphed Jiang, suggesting three ways to resolve the Shandong issue: (1) Han and Liu each stationed in their original defenses, and the Central Government would be responsible for handling the military pay distribution; (2) Liu Zhennian's troops would leave Shandong and other troops would be transferred to fill the defenses; (3) (Code unclear). However, regardless of Jiang's intention and which method he takes, he should order both parties to quickly stop the conflict as a prerequisite. This order has been telegraphed to Jiang Bocheng to relay to all parties for compliance. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>

<p>Bombing of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bridge in Fularji</p>
<p>Shooting at Red Cross Relief Workers</p>
<p>Hailar, Su Bingwen's circular telegram stated: To all newspapers, I recently sent a telegram to the League of Nations, which reads: After the Japanese militarists violently occupied Manchuria, all perfect areas have been invaded by them. Taking Heilongjiang Province as an example, after the Jiangqiao battle, they concentrated all their efforts on the counties in eastern wasteland. The armies were all massacred, the places were all devastated, the people could not live, and the villages and towns became ruins. The Harbin-Changchun and Harbin-Suihua lines of the Chinese Eastern Railway were wantonly destroyed and could not be used. Recently, they have gathered their forces to oppress the Railway Protection Army of our Harbin-Manzhouli line, and dispatched six bomber planes to destroy the Fularji railway bridge on the Yangjia days, killing many road workers. They also used four cannons and about a thousand infantry and cavalry to launch a fierce attack on the Fularji station Railway Protection Army, advancing by land and air, with extreme ferocity. For the sake of protecting the railway and self-defense, our Railway Protection Army decided to deal with them and has been fighting fiercely for several days. The morale is boosted, and justice is on our side, so victory is in sight. The Manzhouli-Harbin line of the Chinese Eastern Railway is the passage of the Eurasia travel, which is related to the welfare of people all over the world. This time, the Japanese army provoked incidents for no reason and bombed at will. The bridge was completely destroyed, and it will be difficult to restore it in the future. The Japanese army should be responsible for this. In addition, the Japanese army in the Ang'angxi Fularji area specifically shot at the relief workers who clearly wore the Red Cross flag, completely disregarding the International Red Cross Convention, which is a great violation of humanity, disregarding faith, and risking the disapproval of the whole world. I must announce to the world so that everyone knows the truth. In addition to ordering the soldiers at the front to maintain justice and do their duty, I hereby send this telegram for your information and hope that you will understand. With respect and sincerity, Su Bingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the Harbin-Manzhouli Railway Protection Army of the Northeast Railway, (Special telegram on the 12th)</p>

<p>Mao Guangxiang Opposes Wang Jialie</p>
<p>Nanjing, After Wang Jialie took office as Chairman of Guizhou, Mao Guangxiang repeatedly raised objections, and political changes were brewing from time to time. Recently, because Guizhou merchants purchased and transported counterfeit Japanese goods from Shanghai to the province, they were completely destroyed by the Anti-Japanese Association. Scholars and merchants hated each other, and almost caused the merchants to strike the market and the students to strike classes. Mao Guangxiang took the opportunity to rise up. The Guizhou office in Nanjing recently received a telegram from Wang, saying that the situation is expected to be eliminated, and the strike of the market and strike of the classes have not been implemented. In terms of the military, the first division stationed in Guiyang and Southern Hunan, the Training Division of Southern Guizhou, the second division of You Guocai in Anshun, Guizhou, the third division of Jiang Zhaizhen in Daoyi, Northern Guizhou, and various independent brigade troops are all close to Wang. Although the fourth division of Song Xingzhi in Bijie, Western Guizhou, is inclined to Mao, there are only a few thousand people. Mao himself had once left the province and moved to Northern Guizhou for more than a month. He is still living in the province. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>

<p>Southwestern Authorities Issue a Circular Telegram Refuting the Report of the Investigation Team</p>
<p>Stating that the Investigation Team Abandoned Its Founding Convention and Recognized Facts</p>
<h3 id="e24">The Northeast Problem Can Only Be Resolved Through National Strength <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou The Southwest Executive Department of the National Government and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee issued a circular stating: All newspaper offices are aware that since the September 18th Incident, the authorities have not attempted to resist, but relied on the League of Nations. Japan has disregarded the League of Nations, repeatedly ordering the withdrawal of troops, and actively expanding its scope of aggression. It is not heard that the League of Nations has taken effective measures in accordance with the covenant. Instead, in the face of facts seen and heard by the world, it has used the dispatch of an investigation team to delay the matter, thereby allowing Japanese warlords to act recklessly. They have subjected our Shanghai and Songjiang areas to unprecedented devastation and have used the old tricks of annexing Korea in our Northeast to create puppet organizations. Recently, they have brazenly recognized these puppet organizations and have unilaterally established treaties equivalent to annexation. It is not heard that the League of Nations has offered a single word of correction. Our country has suffered such deep and great trauma, yet we are still concealing our grievances, waiting for the completion of the investigation team's work, hoping that the League of Nations will base its report on a fair resolution. Unexpectedly, yesterday, after reading the newspaper, the summary of the investigation team's report, which was announced on the 1st of this month, the team proposed so-called basic principles and methods that could lead to a satisfactory resolution of the Manchurian issue. It does not hesitate to abandon the covenant on which it is based and disregard the facts it has recognized, making contradictory statements to appease the powerful. Regarding the responsibility for the September 18th Incident, it is already known that the Japanese side had a detailed plan prepared, and China did not attack Japanese troops or harm Japanese residents. The Japanese military actions cannot be regarded as a legitimate means of self-defense. Then Japan is clearly the leader in destroying the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, and should be subject to appropriate sanctions. Unless the League of Nations resolutions are followed to restore the situation before September 18th, there can be no solution. However, it is said that restoring the old situation is not a solution, abandoning the entire theory of the case and taking into account the illegally created situation. Regarding the reform of the Northeast's politics, it is already known that the three northeastern provinces are entirely Chinese territory, and in no way, legally or factually, can they be separated. Then the improvement of the politics of the three northeastern provinces falls within the scope of China's internal affairs. The Chinese government has its own consistent domestic policy, which should not be subject to foreign interference. However, it is advocated that under the Advisory Council, a special system of government should be organized, and a special gendarmerie should be used to maintain internal security. The appointment of administrative chiefs of the three northeastern provinces, the allocation of taxes, and the central government of China should have no say in them. The special gendarmerie must be trained by foreigners, the tax authorities must be supervised by foreigners, and the central bank of the three northeastern provinces must have a foreigner as the chief advisor. The autonomous government must also hire a considerable number of foreign advisors, with the Japanese occupying an important proportion. In the current situation, the so-called organization of the Advisory Council must also be manipulated by the Japanese. In this way, it is beautifully called autonomy, which is no different from international co-management by Japan. It still says that it maintains China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Who will it deceive? The report states that the establishment of new treaty relations between China and Japan, for Japan, advocates that it should freely participate in economic development, promote the rights and interests of residence and land lease, and expand the scope of consular jurisdiction, even including Jehol, which has not yet been occupied by Japan. For China, it advocates that Manchuria should gradually become a demilitarized zone, stipulated by treaty that the demilitarized zone should not be violated, and promise in the commercial treaty to prohibit the domestic boycott of Japanese goods. The League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty cannot stop Japan's aggression, then the so-called non-violation of the demilitarized zone only prevents China from stationing troops for defense. Buying and selling goods is purely a matter of the people's livelihood and cannot be interfered with by the government. Even if there is a boycott movement, there are many examples of peaceful resistance to violence in various countries. How can there be a reason to bear the obligation to prohibit it in the treaty? In the past, the twenty-one demands made by Japan to us, the special rights regarding Manchuria and Mongolia requested were not as harsh as those listed by this investigation team. In this way, it is said to be suitable for the interests of both China and Japan, which is even more ridiculous. As for saying that the solution to the Manchurian problem must consider the interests of the third party, the Soviet Union, it is not known what its significance is. Before Japan conveniently occupied the Northeast, how could China have harmed the interests of the Soviet Union? If the recommendation of the investigation team is followed, maintaining Japan's special power in the Northeast, causing this problem to be unresolved and expanding, will become one of the entire Pacific problems, not just a problem between Japan and the so-called third party. The report also said that the ultimate requirement for appropriate political measures should be, as advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, international cooperation to complete China's internal rejuvenation. It is not known that Premier Sun advocated international joint investment to develop China's industry, which is not the ultimate requirement for appropriate political measures. The development of industry must be under our control, and others cannot take over the responsibility on our behalf. If this is used as a cover for advocating international co-management of the Northeast, it not only misunderstands Premier Sun's teachings, but also clearly contradicts nationalism. In summary, the observation of the report on the facts of Japan's invasion of China is not unclear, and it has made this compromising suggestion, not daring to make a fair proposition. We see here more clearly that the so-called League of Nations and the so-called covenant are really not to be relied upon. The Northeast problem can only be resolved by relying on the strength of our nation. The integrity of China's territory and the independence of sovereignty can also only be maintained by relying on the strength of our nation. From now on, we must bear a firm will and the spirit of sacrifice to continue resistance and seek the recovery of lost territory. The situation is urgent, and there is no room for hesitation. We hope that our government and people will rise up together to plan for it. The Southwest Executive Department of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government respectfully announce, (11th Press Dispatch).</p>

<p>Luo Wengan Will Visit Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou Today</p>
<p>The Nanjing Foreign Affairs Committee has consulted several times on its opinions on the report, but because it is of great importance, opinions from all parties should be widely solicited, especially the opinions of Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek, which are even more important. However, Wang and Chiang have just read the full text and are still studying it in detail and have not yet expressed their views. Foreign Minister Luo has specifically scheduled to fly to Hankou on the morning of the 14th to meet with Chiang Kai-shek for consultation, return to Nanjing on the 15th, and fly to Shanghai on the 16th to meet with Wang Jingwei for consultation, so that a concrete decision can be made (13th Central Telegram).</p>
<p>A Nanjing reporter met with a government official on the 13th and asked about the extent of the government's discussion of the report of the Investigation Team. According to the official, the government is still seriously discussing this and has not yet made a concrete decision. Currently, there are already many criticisms from various parties about the report, some saying that certain articles and points are still fair, and some saying that certain chapters and sections are absolutely unacceptable. In fact, the discussion and research of such chapters and articles are not where our current energy should be focused. What we should pay the most attention to today is the international atmosphere and the attitude of the Japanese side. The report of the Investigation Team is only a report to the League of Nations. The solution to the Sino-Japanese problem will still be discussed by the General Assembly of the League of Nations. If the Japanese side can change its always stubborn attitude and seek an appropriate solution to the Sino-Japanese problem under the supervision of the League of Nations, then we should start from the big picture and consider a solution based on the principle of not losing rights or humiliating the country. If the Japanese side is still strong, barbarous, and disregards everything, then we should make proper preparations on the one hand, and pay attention to the international situation and the changes arising therefrom at any time. If the international situation deteriorates as a result, then we should make proper plans for all preparations at this time (13th Central News Agency Telegram).</p>

<p>Nanjing The person in charge of the 19th Route Army's office in Nanjing said that the army was ordered to unify the command of the troops in Fujian to maintain stability. After Chen Guohui, commander of the 1st Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Army, was detained, the Provincial Defense Forces, due to their common behavior in peacetime, could not help but feel insecure and plotted to resist jointly. According to the Provincial Defense Forces, there are four brigades, each with about 5,000 men. Except for Chen's brigade, which has been completely resolved, there are only 15,000 men in total. Director Jiang is seeking welfare for Fujian and eliminating local scourges. Although there have been changes in the Provincial Army, they are still being疏解, hoping that they can fully obey.

<p>Using both bribery and force to deal with the Volunteer Armies.</p>
<p>Avoiding direct conflict with Russia in Northern Manchuria.</p>
<p>▲ China United News Agency (13th, Tokyo): Nagata, Chief of the Second Department of the Japanese General Staff, and Major Oki, head of the China Section, departed from Tokyo for Shenyang at 9:00 this morning. Nagata's trip is to convey the policies decided upon at yesterday's meeting of military leaders, explain the aims of the new policies, and urge their implementation. According to investigations, the so-called new policies are as follows: (1) Regarding the Rehe problem, both bribery and military offensive policies will be used. The methods and timing will be left to the discretion of Commander Mutō. (2) Regarding countermeasures against the Volunteer Armies, the primary emphasis will be on bribery, with military force used only as a last resort. It is best to avoid Japanese casualties. (3) Regarding countermeasures against Su Bingwen's anti-Japanese resistance, consideration must be given to the relationship with Russia, and the rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway and Russian expatriate property must be respected to avoid a direct conflict between Russia and Japan. It is best to invite Russian officers to observe and monitor the fighting. Other issues, such as countermeasures against the Lytton Report and the proposed Russo-Japanese-Manchukuo non-aggression treaty, will also be explained to the Kwantung Army, and the Kwantung Army's opinions will be sought. Major General Nagata's trip is to facilitate communication between the military headquarters and the Kwantung Army, convey military orders, and his mission is of great importance.</p>

<p>Decides to Participate in the Vote</p>
<p>▲ China United News Agency (13th, Tokyo): Recently, there has been a faction within the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs advocating a showdown with the League of Nations, abandoning the previous policy of passive resistance. They argue that the attitude taken by Foreign Ministers Shidehara and Yoshizawa towards the League of Nations—namely, denying the League of Nations' authority to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute under Article 15 of the League Covenant and participating in the Assembly only as an observer without participating in the vote—should be abandoned. Japan has made a final decision to rescind its previous policy, formally recognize the Assembly's authority under Article 15 of the Covenant, participate in the vote, and demonstrate Japan's resolve. It is said that Foreign Minister Uchida also agrees. If realized, this would be a change in Japan's foreign policy over the past year.</p>
<p>▲ Japan Alliance News (13th, Tokyo): The Seiyukai party has decided to send former Diet member Futami Jinxiang to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Assembly.

<p>▲ Den-tsu (13th, Tokyo): The three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy held a joint meeting this afternoon to finalize the memorandum regarding... and will begin drafting it immediately. It is reported that the memorandum will be approximately 40 pages long and will be completed by the 20th.</p>
<p>▲ China United News Agency (13th, Tokyo): Today, the three ministries of Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs held a joint meeting to decide on the outline of the Japanese government's memorandum on the Lytton Report. The main points are: (1) The Lytton Report's sources and perspective are unfair. (2) Resolving the Sino-Japanese issue, especially the Manchurian issue, through peaceful means is unrealistic. Based on this position, the memorandum will be drafted under the following six points: (1) Manchuria is historically separate from mainland China and cannot be considered China's original territory. (2) Japan cannot absolutely admit that the September 18th Incident was a planned act by Japan. (3) Japan cannot agree with the view that the establishment of Manchukuo was a Japanese scheme and insists that it represents the will of 30 million Manchurians. (4) China cannot be considered an organized independent state. (5) The responsibility for boycotting Japanese goods lies with China, not with Japan's policy of aggression. (6) China, as a non-organized state, naturally cannot claim territorial integrity or sovereignty.</p>
<p>▲ The Tokyo Yorozu Shimbun reports that the Lytton Commission's disregard for the fact of "Manchukuo's" independence has aroused great indignation among the Japanese people. In particular, Army Minister Araki is outraged by the source of the following material in Section 1 of Chapter 6 of the report: "The independence of Manchuria is related to Japan's new political movement. Japanese civil and military officials, whether in office or not, planned, organized, and implemented this independence movement in terms of solutions to the Manchurian Incident." This material originated after the autumn of last year when middle-ranking officers in the military became dissatisfied with various national policies. At the same time, business circles felt great fear. Therefore, when the commission arrived, these business leaders, solely pursuing the interests of businessmen, provided the commission with malicious material attacking the military, which the commission then used as material for its report. Thus, the reason why the report is unfavorable to Japan is this. The heads of the military and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now recognize that the business leaders committed this imprudent and traitorous act. It is now clear in the report and they are quite resentful. A major domestic problem is about to erupt.</p>

This department will be established soon and will be similar in nature to the general staff headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Ambassador to Russia Hirota is currently in Tokyo, and if he resigns, the position of Ambassador to Russia will be filled by Matsushima, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<p>▲ Kuo Min News Agency (13th, Moscow): Today, the Communist Party newspaper Izvestia commented on the Lytton Report, saying that its purpose is to arouse world opinion against Japan and consolidate the United States' position against Japan. The article was written by the famous Communist journalist Radek and is the first formal comment by the Soviet Russian organs on the Lytton Report. According to Radek, the report's wording incites Japan to attack Soviet Russia on one hand but also seeks to leave a path open on the other hand so that Soviet Russia can join the united front against Japan in the future. It also said that the report is being closely watched by Moscow because it shows how imperialists will resolve the Far East issue if Japan is subdued by various countries. Looking at the content of the report now, it is clear that if the imperialist countries can pressure Japan to accept it with sufficient pressure, they will want to re-establish an international banking syndicate in China.</p>

<p>▲ Havas (12th, Paris): French Prime Minister Herriot, accompanied by two aides, departed for England at 4:45 this afternoon and arrived in London at 11:00 p.m.</p>
<p>▲ Havas (12th, London): The British government does not seem to have any definite disarmament plan to submit to Herriot but will certainly demand that several major principles be discussed. As for the participation of the US representative Davis in the talks between the British and French prime ministers, no one is hiding it.</p>
<p>▲ Havas (12th, London): Political circles are talking, proving that the Prime Minister and Herriot will be completely free in spirit and action during the talks. Today's cabinet meeting discussed important issues such as the Ottawa Agreement, the unrest of unemployed workers in the capital of Northern Ireland, and the Irish question. Regarding the disarmament issue, it seems that several major points have been decided. The cabinet has also allowed MacDonald to proceed freely.</p>
<p>▲ Kuo Min News Agency (13th, London): French Prime Minister Herriot arrived in London late last night and went to 10 Downing Street at 10:40 this morning. British Prime Minister MacDonald immediately invited him in for a private meeting lasting nearly an hour. At 11:30, he summoned Foreign Secretary Simon and Permanent Under-Secretary Vansittart and others to discuss the matter together, which lasted another hour before ending. He then issued the first announcement, stating that informal discussions had been held regarding the difficulties in the disarmament process and that they would meet again at 4:30 this afternoon. British Prime Minister MacDonald hosted a banquet at noon today, and all those involved in the talks attended. Conservative Party leader Baldwin, Navy Minister Monsell, and others were also present. Simon will host a banquet tonight. It is expected that Herriot will return to Paris tomorrow night.</p>
<p>▲ Kuo Min News Agency (13th, Paris): Although the talks between Herriot and MacDonald could not begin until 10:00 this morning, the Parisian newspapers had already predicted this morning that the talks would fail because most of the British cabinet members rejected France's new disarmament and security plan.</p>

The South American agreement with Britain stipulates that British goods can be imported tax-free, while special taxes will be levied on foreign goods imported into South America. The British-Indian agreement stipulates that 163 types of British goods will enjoy preferential treatment with a 1/10 tax reduction. In the future, cotton and silk goods may also be included in this preferential treatment. Australia will allow a 15-20% tax reduction for British goods. New Zealand will also reduce import taxes on British goods. Britain has promised that certain products from Newfoundland will enjoy a 1/10 tax reduction. The results obtained by the British colonies at the Canadian conference are to increase the provisions for preferential treatment, but the preferential treatment is limited to automobiles from the Straits Settlements and Hong Kong. Malaya benefits from a tax reduction on canned jackfruit. Tropical products, including West Indian fruits and West African vegetable oils, will all enjoy preferential tariffs in the self-governing territories. The above agreements are the results of the Ottawa Imperial Conference.</p>
<p>▲ Kuo Min News Agency (12th, London): Today, the British government published excerpts from the agreements of the Ottawa Imperial Conference. According to the contents, the preferential tariff rates for the British Empire's territories can enable British manufacturers to seize 31 million pounds of trade from foreign merchants. This trade is currently mostly enjoyed by German and American merchants. Therefore, the results of the Ottawa Conference have the greatest impact on the US and Germany. This excerpt is 95 pages long and discloses all the points that have been kept secret so far in the agreements. According to British officials, the value of goods imported by the self-governing territories last year that should be subject to preferential tariff treatment according to the agreement is at least 70 million pounds, with manufactured goods accounting for the majority. The United States has a large amount of these goods sold to Canada and Australia, and this will be greatly affected in the future. The extent to which US exports to the British self-governing territories will be affected has not yet been estimated, but US exports are mostly to Canada. In 1930, US exports of 13 major products to Canada were worth US$34.2 million, mainly coal, iron, and industrial machinery. In the British-Indian agreement made at the Ottawa Conference, it is stipulated that Britain will levy a tax of 1 penny per pound on foreign rice, but not on broken rice.</p>

<p>Seeking the Realization of Equality in Armaments Abroad</p>
<p>Establishing a Strong and Powerful Government at Home</p>
<p>▲ Havas (12th, Berlin): How is Germany's new politics? Chancellor von Papen vaguely mentioned it in a speech in Munich. The approximate idea is to establish an authoritative state. The balance set by the Weimar Constitution between the House of Representatives and the President will be broken, so that the President's power will be increased, and a cabinet responsible only to the President will exercise power. In order to make it easier for Bavaria, Saxony, Württemberg, and Baden to agree, major concessions will be made to them, and they will be allowed to restore the monarchy within the Federal Republic. German public opinion does not seriously oppose this fundamental reform.</p>
<p>▲ Kuo Min News Agency (12th, Munich): Today, German Chancellor spoke to famous industrialists in Bavaria, earnestly asking the people to support the government and its domestic and foreign policies. His words were extremely moving and broadcast nationwide by radio. He first discussed the government's international equality movement, saying that it is the foundation of economic construction because if a country is weakly situated among its militarily powerful neighbors, no one will dare to invest in it. Then, regarding political issues, he forcefully stated the urgency of amending the constitution so as to establish a strong and powerful central administrative organ independent of party interests. However, the government will not lightly abandon the basic principles of the republican constitution and is willing to cooperate closely with the various states to accomplish this great task. The government will submit a constitutional amendment to the new parliament and hopes that the parliament will not forget its important responsibilities. Finally, he praised President Hindenburg, saying that he will never violate his oath to uphold the Weimar Constitution. At the end, he summarized the ambitions of the National Socialist Party, saying that the views of the conservatives and the National Socialist Party now have no hope of reconciliation.</p>

<p>▲ Japanese Army Builds Large Power Grid in Harbin</p>
<p>▲ Mr. and Mrs. Xie Ke Cleverly Deceive the Japanese</p>
<p>▲ Two Major Purposes of the Japanese Army's Designs on Jehol</p>
<p>▲ Peiping Correspondence: Yesterday afternoon, our reporter visited Mr. Xi, a friend who recently arrived in Peiping from Harbin, and inquired about important news from the Northeast. According to him:</p>
<p>▲ Harbin's Economy on the Verge of Bankruptcy: Under the strict maintenance of order by the Japanese puppet military police, robbery cases are increasing daily in Harbin's streets. After 7:00 PM, the more secluded streets are devoid of pedestrians. In the area south of Xiangfang for dozens of li and near Songpu Town north of the river, there are frequent skirmishes between the volunteer army and the Japanese army. In Harbin's streets, the sound of cannons can be heard daily. To prepare for any eventuality, the Japanese army has spent a huge amount of money to build a large power grid around Harbin. On the road from Xiangfang to Harbin (about fifteen li long), the Japanese army has set up multiple checkpoints, where they frequently search pedestrians, especially strictly before 8:00 AM and after 7:00 PM, which effectively cuts off pedestrian traffic. As for Harbin's economic situation, it is virtually on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>▲ Ma's Army Advances Towards Suihua: Regarding Ma Zhanshan's troops, in addition to a portion actively operating on the Qiqihar line, forming a liaison with Su Bingwen, who has newly raised the banner of resistance, the majority are still actively engaged in sabotage work in the Hulan-Hailun line area. Bridges and railway tracks are frequently destroyed, causing the Hulan-Hailun Railway to operate intermittently. At the end of September, Ma's Zou Regiment and Tian Regiment, etc., fiercely fought the Japanese army for five or six hours at Keyinhe Station, forty li south of Hailun, killing more than thirty Japanese officers and soldiers, and destroying bridges and railway tracks in the vicinity of the station. As of the fifth of this month, when he left Harbin, he heard that Ma's army was taking advantage of the victory and advancing towards Suihua. Due to flooding, Japanese tanks and airplanes were largely ineffective, which was the main reason for the Volunteer Army's victory at that time.</p>
<p>▲ Xie Ke Escapes the Tiger's Mouth: After the Japanese army experienced various difficulties in their operations in northern Dong Province, they decided not to attack militarily unless absolutely necessary. Instead, they adopted a policy of appeasement towards the leaders of the Volunteer Army. Xie Ke, Ma Zhanshan's chief of staff who was previously arrested, was imprisoned in Changchun and later moved to Jiang Province. The Japanese army used various means to persuade Xie to repent and join the puppet state. Xie feigned compliance and submitted a letter of repentance, so the Japanese changed his imprisonment to surveillance. When the Hailun-Manchurian Railway troops revolted, the Japanese army immediately understood Su Bingwen's motives and tried to persuade Su's staff. Mrs. Xie Ke, knowing the intention of the Japanese authorities, seized the opportunity to argue that Xie's visit would be effective, and said that she and Mrs. Su were close friends and were willing to go with Xie. Hayashi Hideichi, the head of the Japanese special service agency, strongly advocated a policy of appeasement, so he agreed to Xie and his wife going to Hailar. After Xie arrived in Hailar, he and Su made large-scale anti-Japanese plans. On the other hand, the arrest warrants for important anti-Japanese figures who had been previously ordered to be arrested were also mostly canceled, and they were allowed to surrender voluntarily. For the more important figures, special personnel were sent to persuade them. It is unknown whether the Japanese will change their persuasion policy after being deceived by Xie's plan.</p>
<p>▲ Japan Further Creates a Mongolian State: From various related sources, we have obtained an even more astonishing piece of news: that the Japanese army is not only creating a "Manchukuo" but also intending to create a Mongolian state. This plan began this spring. However, the Japanese army does not want to adopt an overt military policy, so they first sent many people to various parts of Mongolia to conduct activities. Once the conditions are ripe, they will simultaneously adopt military force. Before completing this plan, the Japanese army in Jehol and the border areas has planned to first take Kailu and Xifeng. Recently, the Japanese army has been actively reinforcing its troops on the Jehol border, partly to threaten Peiping and Tianjin and block traffic to and from the Northeast, and partly to complete this plan.

<h3 id="e96">A Page in the War History of Wang Delin <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>▲ Heroes of Laoye Ridge Achieve Merit</p>
<p>▲ Enemy Ambushed at Hama Pond</p>
<p>A visitor from Kirin in Peiping talked about Wang Delin's National Salvation Army. Since the Japanese army invaded the Northeast, Wang Delin's troops, with the strength of a battalion commander, have risen up to save the country. It has been a year since then, with more than a hundred battles fought, especially the battles of Jingpo Lake and Laoye Ridge being the most fierce. They are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Battle of Jingpo Lake: Jingpo Lake is located south of Ning'an and east of Laoye Ridge, and is the only way for the National Salvation Army to attack Dunhua. After the Japanese army suffered a defeat in the South Lake Head battle, they led more than a thousand men to counterattack, engaging the National Salvation Army in the area. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered more than three hundred casualties. The remaining troops were surrounded by Wang's army in Jingpo Lake. Three days later, the Japanese army was completely annihilated due to lack of food and ammunition. The guns and artillery were completely captured by the National Salvation Army. After hearing the news, the Japanese army headquarters immediately sent a battalion of guards, a battalion of mortars, three companies of machine guns, and more than ten airplanes for cover, rushing to the rescue. Wang's army, outnumbered, retreated to the vicinity of Dashifeng in South Lake Head and ambushed in the surrounding forests. The Japanese army was unfamiliar with the terrain and came to attack. The National Salvation Army's ambush troops rose up from all sides, annihilating countless enemies and shooting down one airplane, capturing three mortars and five machine guns. The National Salvation Army also suffered more than thirty casualties.</p>
<p>▲ Fierce Battle of Laoye Ridge: A few days after the National Salvation Army's victory at Jingpo Lake, they recovered Ning'an and continued to occupy Hailin, Mudanjiang, and Hengdaohezi. The National Salvation Army then set out in three routes: Kong Xianrong's troops advanced along the Chinese Eastern Railway to attack Yimianpo, Wu Yicheng's troops advanced straight to Dunhua along Jingpo Lake, and Wang Yichen's brigade crossed Daqingbei Mountain to attack Hunchun. After more than ten days of fierce fighting, they successively occupied Yimianpo and Dunhua, but failed to capture Hunchun. After Wang's troops entered Dunhua, they immediately seized Laoye Ridge, the most important and dangerous point for attacking Kirin Province. The Japanese army, in order to rescue Kirin, dispatched a large force from Yanji and launched the first attack on Laoye Ridge and Hama Pond. Only a dozen sentries of the National Salvation Army defended the enemy in dangerous places. For a time, the sound of guns and cannons shook the mountains. Our reinforcements rushed to the scene and switched to the offensive. After more than two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army retreated due to the rugged mountain paths and complex forests. Our army did not pursue them. Three days later, the Japanese army launched a second attack on Laoye Ridge from Yanji.</p>
<p>▲ Annihilating the Japanese Army at Night: The Japanese army passed through Xiaochengzi and, as it was already dusk, camped there. This was detected by Ma, the battalion commander of the National Salvation Army, who led his troops to attack while the Japanese army was asleep. That night, the sky was extremely dark, and it was difficult to distinguish faces. When the National Salvation Army arrived at Xiaochengzi, it was almost three o'clock in the morning. They immediately charged into the Japanese army camp, all using bayonets to stab and kill. The Japanese army was caught in their sleep and suffered more than two hundred casualties. The rest fled in panic, and the guns, ammunition, and horses were all captured by Battalion Commander Ma. Three days later, after two defeats, the Japanese army dispatched a large force from Yanji, covered by airplanes, and launched a third attack on Laoye Ridge. Because the Japanese army was coming on strong, the National Salvation Army laid ambushes in various parts of the ridge and ordered that the key point of Hama Pond be abandoned. When the Japanese army approached Laoye Ridge, they ordered an encirclement from all sides. After a day and night of mixed warfare, the Japanese army began to retreat due to heavy casualties. However, because the key point of Hama Pond was still captured by the National Salvation Army, they could not withdraw and were in complete disarray. Only more than two hundred people escaped. In this battle, a total of more than 1,200 enemies were annihilated, more than 300 were wounded, and many small cannons and rifles were captured. The National Salvation Army also suffered nearly a hundred casualties.</p>
<h3 id="e97">New Trends in the Resolution of the Shandong Crisis <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>▲ Jiang Bocheng Talks About Resolution Within a Week</p>
<p>▲ Satisfactory Results from Li and Fan's Negotiations with Liu's Representatives</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang, the investigators sent by the Ministry of Military Affairs to investigate the Shandong crisis, are currently inspecting in Shahe and meeting with representatives of Liu Zhennian. The results of their inspections and meetings are being reported to the Central Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek daily. After completing their mission, they will return to Jinan soon. According to reports here, Liu Zhennian's troops must eventually be transferred out of Shandong and withdraw from Yexian within a recent period, concentrating within the area designated by the Central Government. It is now waiting for Liu Zhennian's expression to realize this. Today, our reporter visited Jiang Bocheng, who is responsible for handling this matter in Jinan on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and inquired about everything. According to him, he came to Jinan to discuss with Chairman Han Fuju according to the meaning of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Han complies with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's opinions in every way. The follow-up solution has been roughly determined, and the follow-up problem can be completely solved within a week at most. It has not yet reached the time for publication. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram expressing his sympathy for Han's magnanimity and absolute obedience. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also sent a telegram to Li, the advisor sent by the Ministry of Military Affairs, instructing him to enter Yexian City to discuss with Liu Zhennian (because the radio in Yexian cannot communicate with Nanjing). It is reported that Li has arranged to meet Liu's representatives at Shili Pu in Yexian. It is not certain whether he will meet Liu.</p>
<p>Song Shiyan, the director of the Peiping office of Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuju, received a telegram from Han and took the Peiping-Pukou train from Peiping to Jinan early on the 11th. According to Song at the station, the situation in the Jiaodong incident is very good in all aspects. Director Zhang Xueliang's expression is especially good. He once said that this incident must be completely resolved by transferring Liu Zhennian's troops out of Shandong in the end. About the chief advisor Chiang (Bocheng) returning to Peiping, there will always be a solution. I (Song himself) came here this time at the request of Chairman Han, and there will be no long delay. I will return to Peiping in a few days.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of the negotiations between the investigators of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Li and Fan, and Liu Zhennian's side in Yexian, according to a Shahe telegram on the 12th, Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang went to Shili Pu at 10:00 AM on the 11th to wait for Liu Zhennian's representative, Li Weihua. At about 12:00 PM, Li was led out of the city by a scholar. The provincial side first sent people to wait at the defense line. After Li arrived, they went to Shili Pu together. The houses were inconvenient, so they changed to an empty room in a temple to meet and talk secretly. The content of the conversation was extremely secret. After about an hour, they finished talking and were escorted out of the defense area and returned to the city by the provincial side. Li Yue said after returning to Shahe at 3:00 PM that the result was very satisfactory. He guaranteed that he would no longer shoot and would absolutely stop military actions, waiting for the central government to deal with it. I will inspect the city, but I must wait for Li to return to the city and ask Liu for instructions before determining when (the 13th) to go out of the city again to discuss.</p>
<p>As for the tragic situation of the siege of Laiyang, according to a Shahe telegram on the 12th: (1) Ge Zhaozeng, the secretary of the Laiyang Party Committee, Wang Baozhen, the principal of the Fourth Elementary School, Zhou Laibao, and the representatives of the gentry and merchants, Li Shaobai, Ge Ziyou, and Zhang Rulin, came to Shahe on the 11th on behalf of all the people of Laiyang to visit the central investigators, requesting the central government to hold the principle of pacifying people and peacefully resolving the Shandong matter. According to reports, there are a total of six regiments of Liu's army in Laiyang. In addition to the 456th Regiment of Liang Ligui's Brigade, there are a stationed regiment, a special service regiment, and a training regiment. Deputy Division Commander He Yisan lives in the county government and presides over everything. Actively build defensive fortifications. The moats are dug in the suburbs, and there are gun holes around the city. Soldiers move without going through the streets. They pass through by digging through the walls of civilian houses. Therefore, no soldiers can be seen on the main streets. Holes are dug everywhere. All departments work underground. Traffic outside the city is all through underground tunnels, without going through the city gates. The first line of defense is at Mashan Fort in the west of the city, using the mountains as a defense. Within twenty miles along the city, people and animals are extinct. All edible food, rice, cattle, and horses are looted and transported to the city for long-term resistance. It is still intended to transfer through Yexian. The people in the city have no freedom of movement. All those who go in and out are those who purchase supplies for the army, but they also need to have a license because they are afraid of leaking the situation in the city. The two armies are still twenty or thirty miles apart. The new county magistrate, Yang Yougui, and the head of the public security bureau, Dou Yaogeng, have set up an administrative office in Shuigoutou, fifty miles southwest of the city. The brigade headquarters is also in Shui. (December 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e98">Current Situation of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲ Most Political Affairs Committee Members Dispersed</p>
<p>▲ Guangdong Military Generals Return to the Province for a Meeting</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, in order to determine the countermeasures against Japan and jointly discuss the League of Nations report, and to seek unity of national will, the Central Government specially sent the Minister of the Interior, Huang Shaoxiong, to inform Zhang Renmin, the chief of staff of the Fourth Group Army stationed in Guangdong, of the ten reasons for the so-called appropriate conditions for resolution in the League of Nations report, requesting consultation with the Southwest authorities to determine the policy. After receiving the telegram, Zhang forwarded it to the Southwest authorities on the 6th of this month. It is said that Tang Shaoyi will issue his foreign opinions during the day, and other Southwest political affairs committee members will have to wait a while before issuing their opinions. The seven members of the Standing Committee of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee are mostly away. Only Tang Shaoyi is in the province, causing the situation of the Political Affairs Committee to feel like the phoenix has left the building. As for the seven standing committee members, Wu Chaochu has already gone to Shanghai, Deng Ziru went to Guizhou a month ago, Xiao Focheng has returned to Siam, and Li Zongren returned to Guizhou from Guangdong on the afternoon of the 4th, arriving in Wuzhou on the 5th. After a brief rest, he took a plane back to Nanning at 7:00 AM on the 6th. Chen Jitang has asked the Political Affairs Committee for a three-week leave from the 6th. After the committee presented it, it only approved a one-week leave. Zou Lu has been on sick leave for a long time. Until yesterday, he went to Hong Kong on official business to discuss political affairs with Hu Hanmin, and did not return to the province until the 7th. Since the above six committee members did not go to the Political Affairs Committee to work, only Tang Shaoyi remained in the province on duty. After Zou Lu returned to the province on the 7th, Tang took the Shengchang ship to Macao on the afternoon of the 7th, and returned to Tangjiawan in Zhongshan via Macao on the 8th. The Political Affairs Committee has recently been caused by the departure of important figures. Therefore, there are rumors that certain two institutions have been invisibly canceled, and there is a saying that Guangdong will set up a separate military branch. There is also news that a certain powerful faction will be consistent with the central government and jointly go to the national crisis, but the Guangdong authorities have remained silent for days. Whether it is as rumored outside, it remains to be proven by facts. However, on the one hand, there are the above rumors, and on the other hand, the generals have returned to the province from the front one after another. It is said that an important military meeting will be held to decide on various issues to deal with the current situation. It is found that the first army commander, Yu Hanmou, has long since returned to the province. The second army commander, Xiang Hanping, has also recently arrived in the province. The third army commander, Li Yangjing, also rushed back to the province on the 5th. Li Hanhun, the Pacification Commissioner of the Northwest Region, was inspecting various counties in the West River, and was also summoned back to Shaoguan in a hurry. He took a car back to the province on the 6th. After the generals gathered in the provincial capital, they immediately held a military meeting to discuss various issues to deal with the current situation. (October 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Liu Wenjin, the Main Culprit in the Embezzlement of Dike Funds, Sentenced to Death <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chiang Kai-shek Orders Military Law to be Applied</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Liu Wenjin, the accountant of the Hubei Dike Construction Fund Management Committee, colluded with Cha Wenchü, the manager of the Sichuan Jianglong Opium Company, to embezzle dike funds to the tune of hundreds of thousands of yuan. Recently, the Wuchang District Court sentenced Liu to five years of imprisonment. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek believed that Liu's intentions were malicious and the sentence was too light. He specially submitted it to the Military Law Department, which sentenced him to death in accordance with military law. On the 12th, the criminal Liu was taken to the vicinity of Xinyang Restaurant on Liudu Bridge, Minquan Road, and executed by shooting. The charges are recorded as follows: "Re: Announcing the charges. Liu Wenjin, the accountant of the Hubei Provincial Dike Construction Fund Management Committee, colluded with Cha Wenchü, the manager of the Sichuan Jianglong Company, to embezzle a huge amount of money. The case was first tried by the Wuchang District Court and sentenced to five years of imprisonment, but the dereliction of duty was not penalized. This headquarters believes that the punishment is too light and is not enough to deter corruption. Liu Wenjin was submitted to the Military Law Department for interrogation. After investigation, the criminal's intentions were malicious, seeking personal gain, and disregarding the lives of the people of the province. How can such a crime be concluded with only five years of imprisonment? He should be shot immediately in accordance with military law to deter corruption and clarify the law. In addition to binding the criminal Liu Wenjin to the execution ground for execution by shooting, this is a special announcement to let everyone know." The announcement included: "Liu Wenjin, 33 years old, from Changsha, Hunan." (November 12th)</p>

She has sponsored many local charitable and public welfare undertakings. The General Office of the Chinese Red Cross Society in Shanghai once specially presented her with a plaque of pine and longevity to commend her. This time, the Songjiang Red Cross Branch plans to raise funds to establish a charitable hospital to benefit the sick. Madam Fei once again made a grand wish, instructing her wise son Zheng Bocang to sponsor the plan and wishing to make the first donation to show her advocacy. Unexpectedly, after autumn, Madam Fei contracted a minor illness. Without seeing its completion, she passed away on the eleventh of this month. Those who heard about it regretted it. The funeral was held yesterday, with plain cars and white horses, and mourners, which was very grand for both life and death.</p>

<p>▲ Building a National Soul Tomb at Tiger Hill: The officers and soldiers of the First Regiment of the Garrison Military Police, many of whom died during the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, were initiated by the former regiment leader Jin Deyang to build a National Soul Tomb on the open space in front of Zhishuang Pavilion in Tiger Hill, burying the remains of the fallen officers and soldiers in a scenic spot to comfort the loyal souls and provide a memorial. Later, Regiment Leader Jin was ordered to be transferred to the Jiangxi Eighteenth Army Cadre Training Corps as the captain of the officer corps. He felt it was inappropriate to suspend the National Soul Tomb matter, so he sent a letter to Shi Kuihe, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, asking him to handle it on his behalf. After receiving the letter, Shi is now planning everything and will start work soon. From then on, the scenic spot of Tiger Hill will have another kind of memorial for people to mourn.</p>
<p>▲ Auctioning Enemy Coal to Help the Volunteer Army: The Anti-Japanese Association of this county recently seized sixty-five tons of Japanese coal from the Shenhe Coal Shop outside Xumen Huangting Street. The Standing Committee ruled that it should be confiscated and auctioned, and the proceeds would be handed over to the Chamber of Commerce for donating to the Northeast Volunteer Army. It is now learned that the enemy coal has been purchased by the Xinfu Rock and Coal Company for six taels of silver per ton, totaling 390 taels.</p>

<p>▲ Ancient Tomb of the Ming Dynasty Discovered at General Bridge: Under the General Bridge inside the East Gate of this county, on the west side of the Furen Middle School, there is an open space, which is the private property of the Ao family and rented to Furen as a playground. Yesterday, the school hired workers to level the playground. In the center of the playground, they suddenly dug up a square green stone about two or three feet in size. The words "Tomb of Ming Scholar Gengyun Chen Jun" are engraved on the stone. The script is ancient. When the Ao family heard about it, they instructed the workers to continue digging. Before they dug down two feet, they dug up another green stone of the same size. Because it had been buried in the soil for four or five hundred years, the writing was blurred and difficult to distinguish, even after the workers washed it repeatedly. It was only known that it was the date of birth and death and the life history of the person in the tomb. According to the records, the era should be the third dynasty of the Ming Dynasty, the time of Emperor Chengzu. Stone mines were also found under the stone, with two coffins inside, both of which were rotten. Only two sets of bones remained, with particularly large skulls, and dozens of ancient coins and several toys were buried. Ao then took them home for research.</p>
<p>▲ The Silk Factory Workers' Strike Situation Expands: A strike broke out in 25 silk factories throughout Wuxi County on the 8th. After the party and government authorities earnestly mediated, it was decided that the factories would resume work on the 12th. However, when the factories started work at that time, a few women came out to obstruct it, led by male workers with different lengths of clothing. They first caused trouble in three factories in the northern district, including Dacheng, Dechang, and Huisheng. The glass doors and windows on the outside were all broken. Seeing the fierce momentum, the three factories immediately stopped work, and the female workers were coerced to disperse. The loss reached more than 2,000 yuan. At 10:00 AM, the striking workers went to the Jinji Silk Factory in the western district to force a shutdown. They first made a noise outside the factory, then smashed the glass windows and wooden buckets, and used iron hooks to explore the silk and cut off all the silk that had not been finished. The silk threads on the car were also pulled off. Fortunately, the county police team rushed to the scene after hearing the news and dispersed them. The factory suffered the most damage, estimated at more than 3,000 taels of silver. The affected factories immediately sent letters to the industry association, requesting the county government to demand compensation. In the afternoon, Director He of the Department of Industry believed that if the workers' strike was not resolved as soon as possible, accidents would inevitably occur. In addition to appointing inspector Zhou Juesheng to come to Wuxi to mediate, he also sent Jiang Nanchun, the secretary of the department, to Wuxi in the afternoon to assist in handling the matter. Chen, the county magistrate, gathered the standing committee members of the labor and capital parties, as well as the two provincial committee members Jiang and Zhou, Sun Danchen of the provincial party department, and Xu Yongyi of the county party department to the county to discuss the matter. The capitalists said that if the silk merchants were to fail again, if they were not forgiven by the labor side, they would have to sacrifice with pain and temporarily close down. The labor side said that the workers had simple ideas and persuasion was ineffective, and they could only wait for the members' congress to resolve it. After joint consultation between the party and government, it was decided to convene a mediation meeting of the labor and capital parties at 2:00 PM on the 15th, and notices have been sent. On that day, except for the four factories that were destroyed, the female workers in the remaining factories voluntarily went to the factories to work because they were eager to make a living, and were not affected in any way. As of yesterday (13th), except for the four factories that could not work due to damage, the rest went to work as usual. However, at noon, a small number of female workers from the northern district, led by people who looked like male workers, flocked to the Gansheng Silk Factory and smashed the doors and windows. Fearing that the strike would expand again, the capitalists believed that the strike was a local problem from beginning to end. If the government had no definite way to deal with those who instigated strikes and gathered crowds to riot, the factories would rather sacrifice and would not accept any oppressive conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a long-distance telephone message, the Gansheng Silk Factory suddenly started work at about 1:00 PM yesterday because it did not fulfill the conditions. When the nearby female workers heard the news, they immediately gathered four or five hundred people and flocked to the factory to accuse them. The momentum was fierce. The Public Security Bureau sent a large number of police officers to the scene to suppress them and persuade the female workers, but to no avail. They fired several empty shots, and the female workers dispersed. At that time, more than a dozen female workers were injured in the head, face, and other parts by police officers with sticks. Afterwards, County Magistrate Chen reported the incident to the Department of Civil Affairs by telephone. It is said that the county magistrate and Public Security Bureau Chief Wu will go to the province this morning to ask for instructions. Wu Jianzhou, the chief of the Second Division of the Department of Construction, went to Wuxi to mediate. Jiang Nanchun, the secretary of the Department of Industry, took a car to Zhenjiang after 6:00 PM last night to report the details. The Silk Factory Association advised the factories to continue to suspend work and wait for the party and government agencies to mediate on the 15th to avoid expanding the workers' strike.</p>

<h3 id="e108">The Municipal Bureau of Education Sternly Reprimands Zhenhuan Elementary School for Falsely Claiming Registration <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The Shanghai Private Zhenhuan Elementary School, without being registered, printed the words "Registered by the Municipal Bureau of Education" on its enrollment advertisements and posted them everywhere in an attempt to deceive. After investigation by the Municipal Bureau of Education, a reprimand order has been issued. The text of the order is as follows: "Upon investigation, this Bureau has found that the said school has not been approved for registration by this Bureau and has unauthorizedly printed the words 'Registered by this Bureau' on its enrollment advertisements and posted them everywhere. It is confirmed by this Bureau that the said school's false claim of registration should be reprimanded. Furthermore, it is ordered to promptly make corrections."</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Municipal Council's Elementary Schools Will Increase Tuition Fees Starting Next Spring <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The tuition fees for the Municipal Council's Chinese elementary schools are quite low. Recently, the director of the Chinese Education Department investigated the economic circumstances of the students' families and suggested that the tuition fees be appropriately increased. During the discussion of this matter at the last Education Committee meeting, the deputy director of finance stated that the curriculum of these schools seemed to be higher than originally proposed, and therefore the fees should be slightly closer to those of middle schools. The director of the Chinese Education Department then stated that the curriculum of these elementary schools was fundamental to education, but that the higher grades had subjects slightly akin to those of middle schools. Subsequently, a committee member stated that the facilities of each school were relatively complete, and the expenses were also considerable, so the tuition fees should naturally be increased. The chairman replied that the tuition fees for public schools should naturally be lower. Currently, there are many students in the schools who can afford higher tuition fees, but it is difficult to refuse their admission. At the same time, another committee member stated that the parents of the students, in their capacity as taxpayers, already bear a portion of the school's expenses. After discussion, it was decided that, starting next spring, (1) the tuition fees for Eastern District Elementary School and Huade Road Elementary School will be increased from three yuan to six yuan per semester, and (2) the tuition fees for Western District Elementary School and Northern District Elementary School will be increased from three yuan to eight yuan per semester. Each school may admit free students, up to one-tenth of the student body, to help poor children. This proposal has already been adopted and implemented by the Municipal Council's Board of Directors at its meeting this past Wednesday.</p>

<h3 id="e118">A Thirteen-Mile Race Walking Star Will Give an Exhibition <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲To Cultivate Rising Talents</p>
<p>The Chinese Open Race Walking Competition has been scheduled for November 13th (Sunday) at 8 AM. The total distance is 13 miles. However, I have a few points that need to be supplemented, which are published below. It is heard that this year's race walking competition is divided into team and individual events to increase interest. The team event has four people. Those who can complete the entire journey within the stipulated time (2 and a half hours) will each receive a reward to encourage those who failed not to be discouraged. For example, last year's athletes Cheng Xuan and Xie Xingdao were both outside the top ten in the World Games. Others, such as the up-and-coming Wang Longbao, Jiang Luchun, and Chen Liwen, were unfortunately not ranked at the top in the World Games. It is heard that the above five are determined to bring honor to the country. With full spirit, they practice every morning, running around the racecourse and diligently practicing race walking. Therefore, the results are very impressive. Also, those who have participated in the World Race Walking Competition and won the top four places, such as Shi, Zhou, Hou, and Zhou, four knights, will all participate in the competition this time and give an exhibition performance. "The top ten Chinese results in last year's World Race Walking Competition are listed below for the reference of comrades who are enthusiastic about this sport."</p>
<p>Chinese Athletes World Ranking Result</p>
<p>(1) Shi Jinsheng 1st place 2 hours 27 minutes 03 seconds (2) Hou Genren 3rd place 2 hours 33 minutes 16 seconds (3) Zhou Ruquan 4th place 2 hours 34 minutes 11 seconds (4) Zhang Zaojiu 9th place 2 hours 42 minutes 21 seconds (6) Xu Aichen 10th place 2 hours 42 minutes 33 seconds</p>
<p>The above five tiger generals are the top ten in the World Games. This time, participating in the Chinese Open, in my personal opinion, only the top five should be added for exhibition purposes. First, to cultivate rising stars, and second, to prevent those who fail from being discouraged. The last five names are listed on the left.</p>
<p>(6) Cheng Xuan 12th place 2 hours 43 minutes 10 seconds (7) Xie Xingdao 13th place 2 hours 44 minutes 13 seconds (8) Wang Zhaoxiang 16th place 2 hours 46 minutes 09 seconds (9) Wu Longbao 17th place 2 hours 46 minutes 28 seconds (10) Zhang Zhihe 19th place 2 hours 47 minutes 48 seconds (Note) Zhou Yuyu, last time, first place, 2 hours 32 minutes 25 seconds</p>
<p>The Chinese Race Walking Association is afraid that beginners may not have accurate posture and may not be familiar with the route. Therefore, on the previous day (9th), Sunday, the first 13-mile practice was held. Shi You specially dispatched Yu Zhicheng, Lu Yutian, Shi Jinsheng, etc. to guide along the way. As a result, Xu Aichen was first, with a result of less than 2 hours. (Sun Shuliang)</p>
<h3 id="e119">A Record of a Tennis Performance in Beijing (Part 1) - Sun, Lin, Fang <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>This time, because of the invitation of Mr. Huang Shaoxiong and Mr. Chen Gongbo, we went from Shanghai to Nanjing to hold a fundraising tennis match. The ticket revenue was all remitted to the Northeastern Volunteer Army. Therefore, Daozhang, Zhaojia, Deguang, Baohua, Feihai, along with a reporter, a group of six people, took the night train to Beijing on Friday. Although the performance in Beijing was only for a short two days, there were several situations worth savoring at the time. Now, because of the instructions of friends Qiu, Lin, Zheng, Jiang, and Liang, I am writing them down in a hurry (editor's note: Mr. Sun has already left for Haizhou to take up his post).</p>
<p>We took the 11 o'clock express train that night and arrived in Nanjing at 7:30 the next day. Mr. Feng Jiangang and others were already waiting at the station. After meeting, we took a car to Lizhi Society, rested for a while, and Mr. Feng asked for our opinions on whether to take a bath first or eat first. A Jia (Zhaojia)'s stomach had been hungry all night, and without waiting for our reply, he hurriedly said, "Let's eat first." We smiled at each other and walked into the dining hall. A Jia didn't say a word, just lowered his head and devoured his food. In the blink of an eye, four eggs and two plates of ham were swept away without a trace. When he wanted to add more, we said, "A Jia, you still have to play ball this morning." Although A Jia put down his knife and fork, he puffed up his cheeks and glared at us.</p>
<p>Around 10 o'clock, we practiced for a while on the Lizhi Society court. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the competition officially started. The temporary order was Deguang vs. the reporter in singles, Baohua and Zhaojia vs. Feihai and Daozhang in doubles, and then Baohua and Deguang vs. the Beijing famous players Ling Daoyang and Ma Qingxi in doubles. The result of the singles match was:</p>
<p>Liang Deguang 7-5, 4-6, Sun Linfang (each winning one set)</p>
<p>Deguang was originally a famous Hong Kong hard court tennis player. The reporter also likes to play on hard courts, so playing on the Lizhi Society hard court was very enjoyable. The result of the first doubles match was:</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia and Lin Baohua 8, Jiang Daozhang 6, Qiu Feihai, draw</p>
<p>Lin Zheng's combination in the first set was impeccable. Sometimes, they used small tricks to catch the opponent off guard. At the beginning of the second set, Qiu Jiang suddenly showed great magic, with surprise moves coming out one after another. Therefore, the result of the two dramatic sets was a tie, with a score of one to one. This battle was full of highlights and won a lot of applause. The result of the second doubles match was:</p>
<p>Liang Deguang and Lin Baohua 6-3, Ma Qingxi 6-2, Ling Daoyang, Lin Liang won</p>
<p>Mr. Ling Daoyang is already over forty years old, and he can still tirelessly compete on the court. Indeed, he is getting stronger as he gets older and can serve as a model for future generations. Mr. Ma's tennis skills are also commendable. However, encountering Baohua and Deguang for the first time, he inevitably had to concede slightly.</p>
<p>After the competition, the sky was getting dark. The general manager of Lizhi Society, Mr. Huang Renlin, invited us to dinner. In addition to the six of us, there were also members of the Shanghai Singing Troupe, gathered together, talking and laughing happily. After the banquet, Mr. Feng, Mr. Yu, and Mr. Chen invited us to a tea party at the International Club. There, we met many friends from overseas. We talked about old times endlessly and didn't say goodbye until after 2 o'clock.</p>
<p>When we returned to Lizhi Society, our car left first. We didn't expect that after we arrived, their car was nowhere to be seen. The room assignment was that Baohua and Zhaojia were in the same room, but the key was with Baohua. Baohua had not yet arrived, and Zhaojia was already very sleepy. However, the iron general was guarding the gate, and he could not enter. Zhaojia was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, bumping into things everywhere. Finally, he couldn't wait any longer and fell asleep on A Liang's bed. We were also too tired, so we were about to fall asleep when suddenly we heard Baohua calling A Jia, A Jia upstairs all the way. After we asked, we learned that the reason they hadn't come for so long was because the car had broken down in a secluded place and had been repaired for a long time before it was driven. Just like A Jia, the two of them were "anxious!" Hahaha.</p>
<p>We slept very well at night, but Taul (Daozhang)'s snoring, like thunder, often made us inexplicably open our eyes and look at him a few times.</p>

<p>The team trained by the American basketball coach Francis A. Schmidt is known as the winning army. Every time in the championship, taking the first place is as easy as taking something out of a pocket. He has won five consecutive championships in the Southwest League of Arkansas. His Texas Christian team also won the Group B League Championship in winter. Now, one of his formations is shown below. Number 3 rushes out to receive the ball passed by Number 1 to the side of the free throw area. After passing the ball, Number 1 rushes to the bottom of the basket. At the same time, Number 4 rushes out from the corner to the side of Number 2 to obstruct Number 2's defense. Number 2 then takes the opportunity to rush across the free throw line to receive the pass from Number 3, and then dribbles straight to the basket, or lifts it into the basket from under the basket, or passes it to Number 1 to throw it in.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Financial and Precious Metals Market Stagnation <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲Minimal Fluctuations, Slight Decrease of Six Candareens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the precious metals market was dull with minimal fluctuations. The total difference for the day was only 2.4 taels. As a result, the price decreased slightly by six candareens compared to the previous day. The market atmosphere was stagnant, and there were still few transactions. This was because the silver market showed no signs of prosperity or decline. The opening price was extremely flat, followed by slight fluctuations of one or two taels. The foreign exchange market was stable, both official and unofficial rates remaining flat. The future market was even more lackluster, as the impending rollover deterred most parties from showing interest. The price stood around 33 taels. The Central Bank continued to purchase spot goods, totaling approximately 700 bars. Companies like Taikang Run, Tongfeng Heng, Run Changyu sold over 600 bars in the morning session, with prices ranging from 34.8 to 33.5 taels. In the afternoon session, Taikang Run sold another 105 bars at 33.4 taels. It is said that all firms had already offset their November contracts. A detailed record of the entire day is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Morning Market Calm</p>
<p>The market opened with November at 734 taels, the same as the previous day's closing price. Large silver bars for near-term delivery rose slightly by 1/16. Far-term remained unchanged.

During this time, Banque Belge sold US$5,625 for January delivery to Socony, and also absorbed US$75 for February. Old Citibank absorbed US$5,625 for January delivery.

At 11:30 AM, the price settled at 32.3 taels. Later, with Bingxing, Heng Yu, and others buying in, the price increased by one tael to 3.3 taels. Yuan Mao, Chun Yuan Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, and others sold out, so the morning session closed at 32.8 taels.</p>

The result was a slight increase of 0.000625 for British pounds and 0.00125 for US dollars compared to the previous day. The call loan market was also very dull with little activity. Trading among Chinese merchants was slow, with approximately 50-60,000 British pounds traded, mostly between banks. Mumbai bought this month's deliveries, while approximately 5-600,000 US dollars were traded, with significant interbank transactions. Some consolidation occurred in the gold industry.

<p>Tianjin Stops Loading...Banks Overbought</p>
<p>Other Ports Still Supplying...Supply Especially Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, banks had overbought silver dollars, and there was already a weakening trend in the morning. However, due to the recent surge in foreign silver dollar prices, many long positions had profited and were eager to sell. Furthermore, the Tianjin group wired yesterday to stop loading, compounding the difficulties, leading to a major shift in market sentiment. The intensity of the price fluctuations was unprecedented, even during wartime. This shows that while the market may be resilient, public sentiment is still like a startled bird, unable to withstand major storms. From this reporter's perspective, the overall outlook is still good. Although the Tianjin group has stopped loading, other ports continue to supply steadily, offering great hope for market realization.</p>
<p>▲Sharp Decline of Seven Candareens in Foreign Silver Dollars</p>
<p>The morning price of foreign silver dollars was 7.105 candareens, down 0.035 candareens from the previous morning. The afternoon market continued to fall by another 0.035 candareens to 7.07 candareens. This kind of violent decline was evident in the turbulent times. If this kind of movement happened in peaceful times, it would definitely attract attention. (Silver Discount Rate) The morning and afternoon discount rates were both 4%, a rise of 1% from the previous day. The overnight water rate reversed, falling to 7-8%. The silver situation was not very tight.</p>
<p>▲Provincial Silver Coins and Copper Coins Followed the Rise and Fall of Foreign Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Jiangnan provincial silver coins initially rose by 0.003 candareens in the morning to 6.2 candareens, but plummeted by 0.05 candareens in the afternoon to 6.15 candareens.

Guangdong provincial silver coins were 6.01 candareens in the morning and approached the 6 candareen mark in the afternoon, at 5.99 candareens. Ultimately, they fell by 0.035 candareens compared to the previous day's afternoon market. Trading volume was 160,000 coins in the morning and 20,000 coins in the afternoon.

<p>▲Silver Clearinghouse Transactions Were Leisurely and Simplified</p>

The morning market for banknotes was 40,000 within the market and 150,000 outside the market. The afternoon market was 45,000 within the market and 90,000 outside the market. The morning market for bank drafts lacked market activity with 1.35 million, and the afternoon market was reciprocal with 800,000. Transactions between foreign exchange accounts of various banks totaled over 1.5 million. Banknote inflows and outflows totaled 1.5-1.6 million.

<p>Yesterday (the 13th), the current market for various bonds at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was still extremely sluggish. Only the Disarmament and the 1920 Bonds saw a total transaction volume of 4,000 yuan. There were no transactions for the others. The futures market was also not as active as before. The market was very quiet with little buying or selling. It was estimated that the morning session opened with 1.185 million yuan, and the afternoon session with 900,000 yuan. As for the price changes of bonds, the morning session was relatively weak, with zero-lot sales slightly more dominant. However, sales in the afternoon became scarce, and prices mostly rebounded. However, the overall bond market environment remained very dull. Market sentiment was leisurely, and supply and demand were balanced, resulting in very slight fluctuations. The final result was mixed gains and losses compared to the previous day, with amounts of only around 0.01-0.02 yuan.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market initially declined and then rose, but market sentiment was quite weak, with a consistently bearish outlook. This was because there were no expectations of significant growth in actual demand from customer groups. A certain manufacturer's mindset was very soft, leading to an increasing number of followers, and the sellers' momentum was particularly strong. However, prices had already fallen by about 14 taels from their higher levels. Generally, more stable players adopted a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>▲Man Biao (Yarn Futures) Initially Soft, Then Stabilized</p>
<p>The Man Biao market opened in the morning with long positions closing out. Sellers took advantage of the weakness to chase the market, causing further panic. Prices for all months fell by 0.03, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.07 yuan. In the afternoon, those taking profits covered their positions, causing the market to rebound. Prices for all months rose by 0.03, 0.04, 0.07, and 0.08 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 39,100 bales.

<p>Inland 85, Wuhu 10, Datong 10, Xiamen 25, Trade 50, Xuzhou 25, Guangdong 125, Anqing 15, Yunnan 40.</p>

<p>The cotton market declined in the morning and rose in the afternoon. Market sentiment was weak, and there was heavy selling pressure, causing the market to briefly show signs of panic. The October contract broke through the 1-tael mark. In the afternoon, those taking profits covered their short positions, and prices rebounded. However, spot cotton transactions were very sluggish, and the market was particularly weak. Nevertheless, the number of sellers continued to grow.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Biao (Cotton Futures) Trends Were Mixed</p>
<p>The Zheng Biao market opened in the morning with weak yarn and cotton markets. Near-term contracts fell by 0.045 to 0.015 yuan, and far-term contracts fell by 0.005 to 0.02 yuan.

<p>▲Cotton Demand Further Stagnated</p>
<p>The demand for spot cotton was extremely quiet. The supply included 5,553 bales of Yao cotton and 1,161 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Yao cotton 27.60. Guang group bought 650 bales of spot. Taicang flower 30.00 was delivered from the warehouse. Dakang bought 500 bales and sent them to the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Nantong Cotton Crop Still Good <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>|New Cotton Selling Price Flat and Weak|</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nantong stated that the cotton harvest in the county this year varied greatly by region. Recently, due to unfavorable weather, there was some impact on yield and quality. Based on the current situation, good fields have yielded over 70 catties per mu, while poor fields have yielded only 20 catties. On average, the final result may not differ much from the initial estimate.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) The Nantong Cotton Industry Association stated that Tong cotton has always been known for its reputation. In recent years, due to farmers adhering to old methods, the production volume has sharply decreased. In addition, ignorant farmers often adulterated cotton with water for profit, resulting in declining quality. In addition to jointly researching and improving seeds with farms, the association issued a notice on the 26th to all ginning shops and farmers within the territory, strictly prohibiting the sale of damp cotton, with violators to be handed over to the authorities for punishment. After the new Nantong cotton came on the market, due to weak market interest, prices remained flat and weak. On the 26th, the price of seed cotton was 16 yuan per shi (approximately 120 lbs), and the price of ginned cotton was 45-46 yuan. Many farmers withheld their goods, waiting for better prices.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Regulating Rice Prices <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>▲Speech by Minister Soong</p>
<p>Minister of Finance, Soong Tzu-wen, recently, in view of the dumping of foreign rice and the drastic drop in rice prices, which has a significant impact on the rural economy, convened a meeting of representatives from rice-producing provinces, municipalities, and the Ministries of Interior and Industry a few days ago to discuss the regulation of food for the people. It is proposed to use tariff policies to protect the rural economy and regulate rice prices, and to extend this to the circulation of domestic food and the encouragement of stockpiling. It is said that concrete measures have been discussed and the results are very satisfactory. Implementing this plan will benefit both the livelihood of the common people and the rural economy. The details of the meeting have been reported in previous newspapers. We now have access to a speech given by Minister Soong at the meeting, which is disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Our country is an agricultural nation. According to the ratio of farmland area to population, the rice produced each year should be able to reach a level of self-sufficiency without the need for external sources. However, examining the number of rice imports over the years, there has been an annual increase. Taking only foreign rice as an example, the import volume in the first year of the Republic was 2.7 million dan, which increased to 19.89 million dan in the 19th year of the Republic, a seven-fold increase. Although it decreased somewhat in the 20th year, the import volume from January to June of this year has reached more than 13 million dan, with a value of about 69 million taels of customs silver, which undoubtedly harms the national economy. The cheap sale of foreign rice has caused the selling price of domestic rice to fall below the necessary production cost, which is enough to plunge farmers into despair. At a time when all countries are striving to develop product dumping for their own benefit, we must urgently seek to implement rice policies to alleviate the current difficulties. After detailed consideration of the decline in domestic rice prices, although there are other reasons, the two most significant factors are the prohibition of rice exports from various provinces, preventing free circulation, and the sharp increase in foreign rice imports. The rice-producing provinces often have restrictions on sales, with each province having its own restrictions, and even each county having its own restrictions, which prevents domestic rice from circulating freely within the country, using the method of adjusting surpluses and deficits to maintain the balance of rice prices. This evil system of suppressing the trade of domestic rice further promotes the large-scale import of foreign rice, thus harming both farmers and the people's food supply. It is now proposed to follow the following principles to seek relief: (1) Domestic rice in various provinces should be freely circulated without obstruction. (2) If the price of domestic rice falls to a certain level, a progressive import tax should be imposed on foreign rice. If it exceeds the assumed price, the import tax should be waived. Regarding the first item, the prohibition of rice, the government has long issued clear orders of reprimand, but unfortunately, the provinces have failed to comply uniformly. In the future, when foreign rice is subject to taxation, domestic rice should be even more freely circulated to achieve the practical effect of rescuing agriculture, and there will be no fear of food shortages in areas that do not produce rice. It is hoped that the provinces will earnestly implement this. Regarding the second item, the method of levying import taxes on foreign rice is a flexible tax law. Originally, most countries, except for one or two countries such as Britain and Belgium that must rely on foreign food supply, have implemented taxation on imported rice. In the past, our country was restricted by treaties, which stipulated tax exemption in the tariff regulations. Fortunately, we now have tariff autonomy, and the treaty clauses that have bound China's tax rights have been abolished. Whether to levy or exempt taxes can be freely determined by us. However, there are good and bad harvests every year. If grain is too cheap, it will harm farmers, and if grain is too expensive, it will affect the people's food supply. Therefore, the act of increasing taxes must first conduct a detailed investigation and determination of the standard price of domestic rice in order to take into account both aspects and determine the tax amount, so as to avoid disadvantages. It is hoped that representatives from various provinces will conduct detailed research on the production and sales of rice in their respective provinces. Next, the issue of agricultural loans is also an important plan for rescuing agriculture. The government should immediately find ways to supervise, encourage, and guarantee that banks will do their best to accept the pledge and loans of rice, providing convenience to farmers. Only when agricultural funds can be activated can they maintain the benefits they deserve from their harvest and strive for the development of agriculture. Taking this opportunity of your discussions on this case, I would like to state my views and hope that you will express your great opinions, conduct joint research, and facilitate the promotion of this plan.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association Sends a Telegram to the Central Government Requesting Strict Orders to Stop the Sichuan War <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>▲Liu Xiang Reports on the War Situation</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai sent an urgent telegram to the government yesterday, stating: "To the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission, we have repeatedly received news from Sichuan that the troops of Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui have engaged in actual mixed warfare. Looking ahead, the Sichuan situation is becoming increasingly unimaginable. The feud between the two Lius is not of recent origin. If the government could have acted decisively and rectified discipline, it would not have come to this today. Now, the two Lius are fighting fiercely without any scruples, as if showing the central government. How will the government deal with this matter? Will it still act as a peacemaker as it did in the war between Han and Liu, thus repeating the mistakes of Huan and Ling? The central government will have no credibility. Moreover, although there are many reasons for the warlords in Sichuan daring to engage in mixed warfare, the lack of prestige of the central government and its perfunctory handling of matters are indeed contributing factors. Take Yang Sen as an example, who was dismissed twice at Liu Xiang's request and reinstated twice. Or Liu Chengdong and Lai Xinhui, who were originally military commanders appointed by the central government, one was arbitrarily eliminated by Liu Wenhui, and the other was arbitrarily detained by Liu Xiang, and the central government ignored it. Even Liu Wenhui has twice sent telegrams opposing the central government, but because of Liu Xiang's recommendation, the central government has also twice ordered him to preside over provincial affairs. Other cases, such as the repeated conflicts between Li Jiayu, Luo Zezhou, and Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui, have also been regarded as normal by the central government, allowing them to live and die on their own. Under these circumstances, the Sichuan army's lack of fear of the central government is almost like Japan's lack of fear of the League of Nations. If the central government does not greatly strengthen its authority and restore its prestige, the Sichuan situation will never be resolved. This association believes that the people of Sichuan are innocent and have suffered from the pain of war every year. After careful consideration, we can only appeal to the central government for rescue. Therefore, we present two measures for your consideration and adoption: (1) Sichuan has neither communist disasters nor bandit troubles, and it has more than 2 million militia who can defend the area. There is no need to station troops there, especially since the stationed troops only scrape money and often have territorial disputes. To eliminate the scourge, the central government should immediately strictly order all the generals in Sichuan to transfer one-third of their more than 300,000 troops to Kangzang to consolidate the western border defense, and transfer two-thirds to Kuiwu to recover the lost territories in the east. If they fail to move within the deadline, the people should be ordered to stop supplying military expenses and grain. If they make excuses for lack of funds for departure, they can be asked where the funds for their mixed warfare come from. (2) If the previous order is ineffective, the central government should dismiss and punish all the generals involved in the mixed warfare, and send a senior official with military power to Sichuan to thoroughly reorganize the military together with the generals who obey the central government, in order to break up the defense zones and unify the Sichuan situation. If there are those who resist orders, an order should be issued allowing the militia to attack them. At this time, another major war may be inevitable, but using killing to stop killing is a last resort. As long as the central government can support the people and eliminate the warlords, even if there are significant sacrifices, we are happy to do so. The above two points may seem impractical at first glance, but we believe that in order to resolve the Sichuan issue today, unless such decisive measures are taken, no matter how much advice or mediation is given, it will be useless. Even if temporary peace is achieved, it cannot be maintained permanently. Moreover, if this situation of each dominating one side continues, the people of Sichuan may be wiped out. According to what this association knows, the strength of the Sichuan militia is more than enough to solve the warlords. The reason they dare not act is that they have no legitimacy or backing. If the government can support the people to solve the Sichuan issue, (1) Before the Sichuan situation is unified, each county can govern itself. (2) The militia of each county is allowed to drive out the abusive troops and maintain public security themselves. At the same time, A. The militia of each county will supervise all the people of the county to strengthen their defenses and not cooperate with the local stationed troops in any way. B. The elders of each county will strictly order their sons in the military to return to their hometowns with their weapons and be incorporated into the militia by the local authorities to take care of their livelihood. Then, all the warlords in Sichuan will collapse without a fight. In short, due to the development of the militia in Sichuan, the troops have become a burden. Their usual plundering of the people is already a heinous crime, and their current devastation of the local area is even more unbearable. This is what this association sincerely hopes that the government will quickly transfer the Sichuan army to rescue Tibet and resist Japan, and fundamentally eliminate the source of the chaos. In a situation of urgency and pressure, we send this telegram to cry out, hoping that the government will cut the Gordian knot with a swift knife and rescue the people of Sichuan from fire and water. This is our great wish. Sincerely, Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association, Yuan Yin.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang's representative in Shanghai received a telegram from Luo Zezhou on the 11th through Liu: "To Chongshi, Mingjie, and Zhenwu, my three brothers, confidential. Today at noon, I received an urgent telegram from Commander Luo of Wusheng. Chongqing Rehabilitation Supervisor Liu Jun, for your review. The national feud has not been avenged, and we are in extreme danger. We were hoping to sharpen our weapons and prepare to resist foreign aggression, but Liu Wenhui took advantage of the situation and claimed troops, attempting to annex. My department is unfortunate and bears the brunt. We have repeatedly retreated over the past few days. The facts are obvious, but enduring humiliation only prolongs the wickedness. Retreating only encourages his progress. Now I am forced to be stationed in Wucheng. The enemy is still besieging the city, and the flames of war have not ceased. Moreover, the enemy troops that were previously moved to Guang'an, Yuechi, and Hechuan are also successively gathering in the suburbs, with the intention of annihilating us. In this urgent situation, it is impossible to sit and wait for death. In addition to supervising the generals and soldiers to swear to coexist with Wucheng, I specifically and urgently submit this report, begging you to issue a decree immediately to stop them, or to intervene militarily, in order to cut off the source of the disaster. Wucheng will be fortunate, and the Sichuan situation will be fortunate. Luo Zezhou kowtows, Zhen. I hereby forward this message, Liu Xiangwen."</p>

<p>▲Representatives from Twelve Counties in Jiaodong Send a Telegram to the National Government, Chairman Chiang, Acting Chairman Zhang, and Chairman Han Requesting the Transfer of Liu Zhennian's Troops to Suppress Bandits and Resist Foreign Aggression. The Telegram is Recorded as Follows:</p>
<p>"To the National Government in Nanjing, Chairman Chiang, Acting Chairman Zhang in Peiping, the Shanghai Anti-War Alliance, and Chairman Han in Jinan: It is found that Commander Liu Zhennian of the 21st Division has been stationed in Jiaodong for five years. His greed and tyranny are boundless, and the people dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Fortunately, hope is in sight, and we urgently call for help. We humbly present the sufferings of the people as follows: (1) Killing scholars to show power. Not long after Liu's troops arrived in Yantai during the Double Tenth Festival in 1928, they brutally killed party members and provincial government members Zhang Ruiting and gentry Zhang Ruixuan, along with more than a dozen others, and abandoned their bodies in the wilderness to demonstrate their power. The citizens were terrified. (2) Extorting donations on various pretexts. In 1929, under the pretext of suppressing Zhang Zongchang and Chu Yupu, a special donation was levied on the counties of Jiaodong, with small counties paying more than 100,000 yuan and large counties paying more than 300,000 yuan, totaling more than 2 million yuan. (3) Harsh allocation of supplies. Liu's troops originally received monthly salaries from the central government, but Liu still harshly allocated supplies to the counties of Jiaodong, under the guise of daily supply money, with small counties paying more than 10,000 yuan per month and large counties paying more than 30,000 yuan per month, totaling more than 3 million yuan per year, several times more than the land tax. (4) Abusing fines for opium and gambling. Instructing the county governments of Jiaodong and the public security bureaus of Yantai, Longkou, and Nanchang, he abused the name of banning opium and gambling to impose huge fines, ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to thousands of yuan, and even fabricated evidence and framed people. The amount of money confiscated for opium and gambling was used as the standard for assessing the performance of the county magistrates. (5) Controlling tax revenue. Whenever the country had affairs, he would seize the tax revenue agencies managed by the central government and the provincial government as his own, showing no regard for the government. There are cases to prove this. (6) Dividing administration. The county magistrates and bureau chiefs in Jiaodong were all appointed by Liu. They knew only of the division headquarters and not of the provincial government. The excessive taxation exhausted the people, who had nowhere to turn. Although Jiaodong was within the scope of provincial governance, it was no different from a foreign land. (7) Embezzling road funds. Except for the Yantai-Fushan and Yantai-Rongcheng road bureaus, which still belonged to the Construction Department, the remaining three lines of Yantai-Laiyang, Yantai-Muping, and Yantai-Haiyang were all built with funds extorted by Liu's troops, and all income went into his private pocket. (8) Forcibly seizing civilian property. North of Tongshen Village near Yantai and south of Qishan, he occupied more than 300 mu of civilian land in the name of a sports field, without paying any compensation. Moreover, in Yantai and other counties where troops were stationed, all the larger civilian houses were used as official residences for military officers without paying rent. (9) Brutally killing the innocent. If the people slightly resisted his greed and tyranny, he would accuse them of being counter-revolutionaries. In serious cases, he would burn and loot villages; in minor cases, he would arrest them and send them to the military court, where they would be tortured and die unjustly. The number of such deaths is countless. (10) Aircraft and warship special donation. Recently, he secretly ordered the counties in the defense area to collect a special donation of 80 yuan for every tael of silver in land tax, intending to purchase aircraft and warships to expand his territory. (11) Fabricating public opinion. The newspapers in Yantai were afraid of his power and dared not criticize him, but they did not help him either. Liu then started his own Donghai Daily to praise his merits and virtues, hoping to cover up the world's eyes and ears with one hand. (12) Forcibly conscripting soldiers. Liu had great ambitions and spared no effort to expand his troops. If recruitment was insufficient, he would forcibly conscript soldiers. Those who were conscripted often spent huge sums of money to seek release. Although Liu's troops have now withdrawn, they are still extorting and harassing the people in the areas of Ye, Lai, Qi, Hai, Mu, Wen, and Rong, making the people miserable. The troubles in Shandong are not over for the people of Lu; the people of Zheng are frightened by Bo You. If Liu's troops are not withdrawn for one day, the counties of Jiaodong will not be safe for one day. We urgently request that he be transferred quickly to save the people from fire and water, and at the same time, be used to suppress bandits and resist foreign aggression. Jiaodong will be fortunate, and the whole country will be fortunate.

<p>▲Liu Zhennian Replies to the Two-Way Party Department Radio Station</p>
<p>"I have received your esteemed message and am deeply impressed by your earnest advice. Since the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, all those with blood and spirit are uniting to resist foreign aggression. However, Han Fu-chu is only seeking his own interests. He took advantage of the national crisis and the deployment of my troops to defend against foreign aggression to launch a surprise attack with his rapid telegrams. In order to comply with the central government's orders and achieve peace, Zhennian has already withdrawn the troops at the front and is gathering his troops to await instructions. I only hope that the central government will issue orders to serve the country. I am willing to lay down my life for this cause. I am sending this telegram in reply, hoping for your clear understanding. Zhennian kowtows. Steaming."</p>
<h3 id="e146">Sharp Decline in Exports to the United States in Nine Months <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>▲More Than 10 Million Yuan Less Than Last Year</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, statistics from the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai show that China's exports to the United States in the first nine months of this year decreased by 75% compared to the same period last year. The value was only US$4,691,479, while the value for the same period last year was US$15,207,413, a difference of more than 10 million U.S. dollars, which is alarming. Moreover, it is found that among the exports to the United States in the first nine months of this year, the only item that increased compared to the same period last year was gold bars, with a value of US$18,792,818, an increase of approximately 2 million yuan compared to US$16,661,663 last year. However, this is an outflow of money rather than a real export of goods, and its value is not included in the aforementioned export amount. As for the export of goods, the most significant decrease was in inedible vegetable products, which were valued at US$358,946 in the same period last year, but only US$9,194 this year, a decrease of 35 times. In addition, the export of textiles and their raw materials, which used to be a major export, also decreased significantly in the first nine months, with a value of only US$1,858,124, compared to US$10,501,326 in the same period last year, a decrease of more than four times. In addition, inedible animal products decreased from US$9,945,920 in the same period last year to US$2,276,524. Among them, only ivory products increased from US$403 to US$1,070, which is a rare exception. Edible animals and their products also decreased from US$574,483 to US$100,968. Timber and paper decreased from US$31,934 to US$11,557. Non-metallic minerals decreased from US$112,022 to US$83,007. Metals and their manufactures decreased from US$202,684 to US$53,992. Chemical products decreased from US$13,627 to US$2,130. Miscellaneous goods such as books, maps, and works of art decreased from US$36,638 to US$13,781. Edible vegetable products also decreased from US$528,840 to US$282,202, but the decrease was the smallest. In addition, our country's exports to the Philippines and Honolulu have also decreased. It is estimated that in the quarter ending at the end of September, exports to the Philippines were valued at US$1,114,529, while in the same period last year, they were valued at US$1,814,826. Exports to Honolulu were valued at US$40,540, while in the same period last year, they were valued at US$61,570.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Telegram from the Northeast People's National Salvation Army <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>▲ A Bitter Account of Years of Warfare</p>
<p>▲ A Tearful Plea for Utmost Assistance</p>
<p>Cheng Yun, Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army Committee, along with Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Government, and more than forty commanders, including Feng Zhanhai, Wang Delin, and Li Haiqing, jointly telegraphed the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association in this city yesterday. They recounted the progress of the resistance against Japan. An excerpt from the original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>"The country is unfortunate; the brutal Japanese have invaded. Our three northeastern provinces have fallen for over a year now. Since the loss of Liaoning and Ningyuan, the enemy army has directly pressed toward Jilin, and provincial administration has been disrupted. We were then commissioned by the National Government to reorganize a legitimate provincial government, exercise political power, and accept the mission at a time of crisis and shock. We commanded the troops with utmost urgency, dedicating ourselves to the nation, unwavering in the face of setbacks. For the sake of convenient dispatch and coordination, the Jilin Provincial Government was temporarily moved to Binxian. Together with General Ma Zhanshan, we supervised the troops defending Heilongjiang, forming mutual support to contain the enemy army and launch a vigorous offensive. After several months of resistance, the enemy's courage was chilled. The powerful enemy mobilized the strength of several army corps to compete with us, taking advantage of the convenience of railway transport to encircle us. Our loyal soldiers fought bravely, each one matching a hundred. When ammunition was exhausted, they resorted to close combat, falling one after another, countless deaths, corpses piled up like mountains, blood staining the wilderness. The Japanese invaders, seeing that our will could not be shaken and our army could not be captured, resorted to</p>
<p>aerial bombardment, devastating our cities, injuring our innocent, and turning everything they reached into scorched earth. To avoid meaningless sacrifice and preserve permanent strength, I reluctantly followed the request of the merchants and withdrew from Binxian with tears. Subsequently, General Ma Zhanshan also withdrew from Heihe due to being isolated and without support. I and others are unable to defend the territory, and death would not be enough to atone for it. However, although the losses in the battles of Jilin and Heilongjiang were significant, the people's hearts were not dead, righteousness was widely proclaimed, and morale was boosted. Thus, the military and the people cooperated and jointly planned a long-term resistance, resulting in the organization of the Jilin-Heilongjiang People's National Salvation Army, with myself as the Commander-in-Chief. Subsequently, I telegraphed General Ma Zhanshan to rise again, vowing to make renewed efforts, and further collected able-bodied men from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, launching simultaneous operations to expand the strength of the National Salvation Army. Within a few months, the National Salvation Armies of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang rose up, numbering 300,000. They were divided into twelve route armies, each responsible for a specific area, combining offense and defense.</p>
<p>Having struggled for half a year, the achievements of each army are not without merit. However, the headquarters of our army is constantly moving, and communication between the armies is often interrupted by the enemy, making information dissemination unreliable. Moreover, because we did not want the enemy to know our strength, and the enemy did not want the world to know that we still had a large base of operations in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, the world knows little about the achievements of the National Salvation Army. In fact, the commanders fighting in the hinterland of Jilin and Heilongjiang and along the railway lines are making daily progress and fighting fiercely. This should be a cause for comfort to our compatriots at home and abroad. For example, Wang Delin, commander of the First Route Army, has recovered more than ten counties in eastern Jilin, fighting along the Jidun Railway, and completely destroyed the roadbed of the section from Huining to Dunhua, which was about to be built by the Japanese and was of utmost importance. All construction materials were burned, and sentries and plainclothes teams were recruited along the line to harass the enemy, so that the Japanese have not dared to start construction on that road until now and have not been able to complete it. Seizing the enemy's transportation and destroying the enemy's railway</p>
<p>has contributed significantly to the overall military situation in the Northeast. Li Haiqing, commander of the Second Route Army, fought thousands of miles, occupying Fuyu, Nong'an, Changling in Jilin Province, and Anda, Zhaodong, Zhaozhou, Lanxi, Qinggang in Heilongjiang Province, with a strong force. The powerful enemy has repeatedly suffered setbacks. Gong Bangjie, commander of the Sixth Route Army, has recovered Shuangcheng, Shulan, and other counties in Jilin Province, located in a strategic location, resisting the strong enemy along the southern line of the Middle East Railway, advancing without retreating. Deputy Commander Feng Zhanhai commanded even more elite troops, using both conventional and unconventional tactics, fighting thousands of miles from Fangzheng to Binxian, to Acheng, to Shulan, advancing rapidly. The enemy and traitorous forces were particularly fearful. Most recently, on September 12, he ordered the 5,000 soldiers under his command in the First Route Army, led by Gong Changhai, to attack Jilin City directly from Huanxiling, west of Ji City. They marched silently and arrived late at night. At that time, 2,000 Japanese soldiers in the city were densely deployed at the west gate, and they rose up to meet the attack. The vanguard of Gong's army arrived like sweeping away autumn leaves. More than 1,000 Japanese soldiers were killed, 600 were captured alive, and Colonel Juntian was killed in battle, resulting in a great defeat.</p>
<p>The puppet country's traitorous army collapsed upon hearing the news. The puppet governor Xi Qia also fled in a disheveled state. Gong's army completely recovered the provincial capital of Jilin City at dawn on the 13th. On one hand, they issued proclamations to reassure the people; on the other hand, they moved the army to the outer regions to prepare to meet the enemy, and blew up the railway along the Tumenling area of the Jichang Railway, cutting off traffic between Jilin and Changchun. The Japanese invaders and the puppet country were also cut off from communication. The enemy's arrogance was extinguished, and the puppet capital was shaken. The Japanese army was angry to hear the news of defeat and kept it secret. We are approaching step by step, and it can be expected that morale will be doubled and the entire territory will be recovered soon. Commander Ma Zhanshan still occupies Keshan, Heihe, Qingcheng, Suihua, and other counties in Heilongjiang Province, rising repeatedly, hoping to achieve the final victory. Commanders Li Du and Ding Chao's troops occupy Suifenhe, Hulin, Mishan, Baoqing, and other counties, forming a chain of defense. Other route armies of the National Salvation Army either adopt a plan to contain the Japanese invaders, organized into guerrilla forces, or take a coordinated combat approach, lurking</p>
<p>for alternating battles, like veins connecting smoothly, the arm serving the body, the finger serving the arm, like the Changshan formation, striking the head and the tail responds, striking the tail and the head responds. Although casualties are numerous, their righteousness is awe-inspiring. Gathering sand to measure rice is not enough to compare with their difficulty, and a rainbow piercing the sun is not enough to describe their fierceness. The beautiful rivers and mountains of Baishan and Heishui have not all fallen into the hands of others, thanks to the loyal and brave soldiers of the Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang People's National Salvation Army, with their spirit swallowing the rivers and mountains, their righteousness reaching the clouds, and their hot blood filling the land. However, wherever the army goes, to ensure the entire army is vigorous, they must be well-fed. For sustained warfare, they must have an endless supply of food. The National Salvation Army has no support from the government above, lacks local financial resources below, has no internal replenishment, and lacks continuous external assistance. Barehanded, they shed blood and brains, and repay the country with utmost loyalty, relying only on hot blood and righteousness. In the spring and summer of this year, the timing and terrain were mostly unfavorable to the enemy's use of troops, and our National Salvation Armies were still able to use them as a shield. Now that the green gauze tents have fallen and the border region is cold first, in a blink of an eye,</p>
<p>the north wind is howling, and the accumulated snow is over the ankles. The National Salvation Army has no food for the night, no lined clothing, and no stored ammunition. How can they plan for complete security and avoid a desperate gamble with a tired crowd against a powerful enemy? It is chilling to speak of and terrifying to think of. This is why the establishment of the National Salvation Army Committee is for the purpose of boosting military morale internally and raising funds externally, which is extremely urgent. I and others, entrusted with the responsibility of the committee and entrusted with the hopes of the elders and disciples of the three provinces, undertake the arduous task and mismanage the army. In addition to supervising my subordinates to be more diligent and thoroughly loyal, vowing to do my best to restore the Northeast, fight for the country's honor, and seek survival for the nation, I respectfully inform the world of the experiences and hardships of our Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang People's National Salvation Army, who hold their weapons to defend the country and fight hard for years. We hope that patriotic people at home, overseas compatriots, fearing that the national crisis has not yet ended, remembering that the future is difficult, and grieving for the suffering of the people in the Northeast, and for the National Salvation heroes who cut their throats and shed their brains to fight for this lifeline, will raise their voices and rise up with righteousness, either imitating Hongyang's contribution of wealth to save the border, or admiring Bu Shi's</p>
<p>sacrifice of family to relieve the national crisis, each exhausting their efforts, enthusiastically contributing, and jointly overcoming difficulties to protect our China. I hope that the masses will lift a heavy weight with ease, and the building will not collapse. This is what I and others dare to pray for with incense and tears, and to beg for on behalf of the people of the Northeast and the soldiers of the three armies. We hereby present our words, awaiting your clear instructions.</p>

<p>▲ Northeast People Changed to Chinese People</p>
<p>▲ Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army Joins the 26th Route Army</p>
<p>Yang Yijie, representative of the Fourth Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, received a letter yesterday from Liu Zongyao, commander of the Fourth Detachment of the 26th Route Army, from Peiping, reporting that our Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army has now been renamed the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. In addition, Jiang Zihang and others of the Shanghai Songhu Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army, formerly in Shanghai, have been issued passports and official documents, and have been sincerely introduced to Commander Zhang Mingwu's subordinates. Jiang Zihang and others left Shanghai on September 28 and arrived in Peiping on October 4. They immediately went to the headquarters and were appointed by the commander as Lieutenant Colonel Commander of the Vanguard Team of the 26th Route Army. The others have all been given appropriate appointments. The official seals and appointment certificates were formally issued on October 8. The Vanguard Team is now undergoing rigorous training, eager to cross the border to kill the enemy, aiming to wipe out the Japanese invaders in one fell swoop. They also hope that patriotic compatriots across the country will unite in loyalty and bravery at this time of national crisis and fight the Japanese invaders to the death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Liu Zongyao, fearing that bad people would impersonate the name of the army's representative to recruit soldiers in Shanghai, specially sent letters to various public organizations in Shanghai yesterday, stating that, "I am writing to inform you that I previously went south to request aid and was in contact with various parties. I then received a letter from General Commander Zhang of our route army calling me north to discuss military affairs. I did not dare to delay and went north. After arriving, I reported all matters in detail. The matters that were not completed in Shanghai have been temporarily handed over to Yang Yijie, the representative of the Fourth Route Army, for handling. After I have been fairly and publicly instructed by the General, I will have to go south again. I am especially afraid that unscrupulous elements will use the name of our route army to solicit donations or recruit soldiers to swindle people. Therefore, I specifically declare this, hoping that you will investigate and prevent impersonation, in order to maintain public friendship."</p>
<h3 id="e149">Yang Yijie Reports on the Anti-Japanese Situation of the Volunteer Army <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Recently Engaged in a Death Struggle with the Enemy</p>
<p>▲ Lack of Bullets and Cotton Clothing, Hoping for Assistance</p>
<p>Yang Yijie, representative of the Liaoning Volunteer Army Fourth Route, has been in Shanghai for more than ten days seeking assistance from the rear. He originally planned to invite people from all walks of life at the Youth Propaganda Group on Zhonghua Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the recent situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army. However, because the address of the Youth Propaganda Group was inappropriate, the reception was changed to the office of the Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team at Sanmei Nunnery outside Xiaonanmen. A record of his report is as follows: (1) Recent situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army: Since the evening of September 28, the Japanese army has attacked Nanling in North Rehe with land and air forces. At that time, Li Fangting's 500 troops were surrounded by more than 1,000 Japanese puppet troops. Geng Jizhou received a telegram from Rehe in Jinxi and immediately led more than 2,000 cavalry to the rescue. On the 30th, he contacted the reinforcements of Li Li, Liu Gui, and Tang's troops and broke through several sections of the Jinzhao Road north of Yixian. We attacked on three routes, and the siege was lifted. At the same time, the enemy's return route was cut off, so they detoured through Yixian and retreated north. Geng Jizhou chased with cavalry and completely surrounded the enemy army in Erdahezi Forest. Liu Gui and Tang's troops also arrived. The enemy defended from a high position, and a stalemate lasted until about 7:00 AM on October 2. The enemy opened up reinforcements of more than 2,000 troops and launched a fierce attack with heavy artillery and aircraft, resulting in a fierce battle. Both sides suffered</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>heavy casualties. Li Fangting's troops in our army lost a regimental commander, a battalion commander, and more than 300 soldiers. The enemy also suffered more than 400 casualties. More than 70 puppet troops surrendered. Our army captured four mortars, ten machine guns, and more than 200 rifles, all of which were obtained by Geng and Liu's troops. Now Geng Jizhou's troops are united with Liu Gui and Li Fangting's troops, planning to go north through Zhangwu and Tongliao through Tuquan to contact Ma Zhanshan's troops again, preparing for a long-term resistance. (2) Difficult situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army: Among the troops in western Liaoning who are determined to resist Japan, the only ones with strict organization and sufficient treasure strength are Zheng Jialin, Geng Jizhou, Li Fangting, and Liu Gui's four troops. Those whose front lines are at the forefront, all the bullets will be used up, and it is already snowing in the Northeast, so the climate is very cold, and each soldier is only wearing a single coat, and the food is only sorghum and millet, and there is no full meal. If assistance is not given early, in the near future, I am afraid that all the righteous soldiers will be bound to wait for death, so the greatest hope of the righteous soldiers at this time is nothing else but bullets and cotton clothing. I deeply hope that compatriots in the country will quickly rise up to assist and provide material donations so that the righteous soldiers outside the country can achieve their goals and recover the lost land."</p>

<p>▲ Hoping for Material Assistance from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team held a reception for the press at 4:00 PM yesterday at the team's office at Sanmei Nunnery outside Xiaonanmen, reporting on the significance of its initiation and organizational situation. More than ten reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. The team leader gave a brief report, which is recorded below: "Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has been in a state of subjugation for more than a year. The government often talks about resistance, but has never seen a single soldier sent out, completely relying on the League of Nations. Now we see that the League of Nations is not reliable. The only ones who can fight the Japanese soldiers to the death are the volunteer soldiers. As for the combat situation of the volunteer soldiers, there is no need to say more. We and others, in view of the lack of people to rescue the righteous soldiers, initiated the organization of the Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team, hoping to raise medicines and other items in the short term and go north immediately to start rescue work, so as to fulfill the duty of the people a little. At the same time, we hope that all walks of life will provide material assistance."</p>

<p>▲ Divided into Teams for Rescue After Crossing the Border</p>
<p>▲ Huangtuling Narrowly Escapes Forest Fire</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reported that He Xiangning, Dun Junzhi, and others, in view of the fact that the Northeast Volunteer Army has been fighting bloodily for years and has suffered many casualties, have specially collected funds to organize a National Disaster Relief Team to go out to the rescue. The rear council of the team received a report stating that since the team followed Army Commander Peng Xiaoqiu out of the pass, the number of wounded soldiers seeking treatment along the way has been almost too many to handle. Therefore, wherever they went, they were warmly welcomed by the local people, who requested regular medical care. The team, considering that the righteous soldiers of the eastern provinces are scattered in various places, decided that if they do not divide into teams for rescue, it would be difficult to achieve universal results. Therefore, they set up a wounded soldier reception center with Peng's troops as the center, and are now working in Chelashanzi in the territory of Rehe. They also sent team members with Zheng Guilin, commander of the 48th Route Army, to stay in Huangshanling, Zixing City. A part of the personnel under Zhu Zhaiqing, the superintendent of the National Salvation Army, are also responsible. Recently, near Huangshanling, there were five enemy planes chasing the rescuers and throwing eight bombs in a row, all of which missed. The team members did not shrink back because of this. Now Army Commander Peng has ordered winter clothes for the team members in Peiping to be used in the severe winter.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Volunteer Army Support Association Aids the Volunteer Army's Clothing Expenses <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association has decided to allocate 20,000 yuan to aid the clothing expenses of the volunteer army. It was originally planned to make them in Shanghai and transport them there, but because the cold clothes made in Shanghai were not entirely suitable for use in the Northeast, it was decided yesterday to allocate cash and have the troops make and distribute them themselves. Peng Zhanhai's troops received 7,000 yuan, and Li Du and Ding Chao's troops received 13,000 yuan. The funds for Li and Ding's troops will be remitted to their representative, Mr. Wang Ziyao, for transfer.</p>

<p>▲ Attachments Still Missing</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Committee's Lytton Report was published in full yesterday, but the attachments are still missing. The report contains 228 pages in Chinese and 200 pages in English. Shanghai received 200 copies each of the Chinese and English versions, which were printed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Newspapers and public and private institutions will not receive complimentary copies. People in this city can purchase them from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Fenglin Bridge. The Chinese version costs 6 jiao per copy, and the English version costs 1 yuan 2 jiao and 5 fen. The report has many attachments, and the details of the investigation committee's recommendations are also in the attachments. The documents the investigation committee referred to and the people they interviewed are also compiled into an index, all of which are important. Those who are concerned are eager to know the details, but unfortunately, they have not been published together. The general public feels regretful for not seeing the whole picture.</p>

<p>▲ There is a Saying He Will Go Abroad for Treatment</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei has been ill and has come to Shanghai for treatment for over a month. He has not yet fully recovered, and his duties are overwhelming. Therefore, Wang has recently said that he will go abroad for treatment with his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun. Therefore, the reporter went to the Noel Hospital yesterday to inquire. According to the hospital, Mr. Wang Jingwei is still undergoing injections of insecticides and will not be finished in a few days. Wang's external appearance is not bad, but he feels weak and powerless when walking. Two doctors from the UK and the US were invited by his wife, Chen Bijun, for diagnosis, and they are often in the hospital to diagnose Wang. As for Wang's departure abroad, I have only heard of it, but I don't know the details. Wang only notified the hospital to stay for another ten days and be discharged around the 23rd or 24th, and whether he will go abroad after being discharged and which country he will go to first are unknown. However, according to other sources, Wang is determined to get rid of politics and will go abroad for treatment. This trip will go to France first, and his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, will accompany him.</p>

<p>▲ And Hopes That the People of the Country Will Not Believe Them Lightly</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun and the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun published a special dispatch from Shanghai on the 2nd of this month, saying, "Chiang Kai-shek will send Dai Tianqiu to Japan to negotiate directly on the issue of the three northeastern provinces and bring five secret plans." The agency found this news very strange and telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to inquire. We have just received a reply telegram, which completely denies it and says that Japanese newspapers have repeatedly fabricated rumors recently to slander individuals, such as saying that I advocate abandoning the three northeastern provinces. These are all fabricated out of thin air and have other purposes. I hope that the people of the country will not lightly believe these unfounded rumors.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Discussion on the US Wheat Loan Issue <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>▲ Letter from the Five Provinces Farmers Relief Association to the US Consul General</p>
<p>The United Association of the Five Provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei) Farmers Relief Association sent a letter to the US Consul General: "Dear Sir, We read in the newspaper that your Consul and the President of the Executive Yuan of our country, Song Ziwen, have agreed to a second renewal of the loan of a large amount of American wheat flour to China, which we heard with great surprise. Unfortunately, our country has suffered successive disasters in recent years. We are deeply grateful to your country for generously agreeing to provide loans for relief. However, because the amount of American wheat borrowed last year was too large and exceeded the needs of the disaster area, we had to sell it at a low price, which lowered the price of various grains. To this day, Anhui Province still has surplus relief flour that cannot be sold out. This year, all provinces in China have had bumper harvests, so the price of rice in various villages has fallen even more. In provinces such as Hunan and Anhui, the lowest price of rice is only a few jiao per yuan, and the price of rice is only three or four yuan (in the past three or four years, the price of rice has been over 20 yuan), so that farmers cannot afford the cost of farming. They are shutting down production one after another. Places without disasters are like disaster areas. This is all caused by the excessive amount of wheat flour last year. Now, if there is a continuation of this proposal, according to the newspaper, it will be 12 million US dollars, which is equivalent to about 500,000 tons of American wheat. Such a huge number is terrifying. If it is implemented in China, China's food will inevitably become surplus, the rural economy will be completely bankrupt, and farmers will have no way to make a living. They will inevitably become bandits. China is cracking down on the Communists. In this way, it will force the farmers to flow into communism. The future is dangerous and unbearable. In addition to sending a letter to our government to change its policy and find other funds, we specially write to you that if you need to borrow money, please cancel agricultural products and replace them with other goods, such as machinery, chemical products, etc., which are necessary for developing China's rich resources. Then it will be really beneficial to our country, and the people of China will be infinitely grateful. We venture to express our words. Please consider it carefully. Sincerely, The United Association of the Five Provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei) Farmers Relief Association."</p>
<h3 id="e162">After the Northeastern Salt Tax Was Seized, the Ministry of Finance Still Paid Foreign Debt on Time <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>▲ But the Impact Is Great and We Are Seeking Ways to Remedy It</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Northeast, the salt tax outside the customs has also fallen into Japanese hands. The Ministry of Finance used the salt tax outside the customs as collateral for foreign debts to various countries. Since the tax revenue in the Northeast was seized, the Ministry of Finance, in order to maintain international credit, still paid it on time. According to financial circles in Shanghai, the tax revenue outside the customs can generate more than 10 million yuan each year. The national treasury has suffered a great loss due to this impact, so the Ministry of Finance has studied this issue and plans to find ways to remedy and deal with it.</p>

<p>The students of Hunan primary schools in Shanghai deeply regretted that the Northeastern Volunteer Army was fighting hard against the enemy but lacked supplies and equipment. Therefore, they launched a children's savings association to save breakfast to save the country. In the past half month, they have collected 13 yuan and 5 jiao to help the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association. If all the children in our country can do this, our country will not be destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Decision on the Distribution of Relief Funds for War Zones <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲ Each Lending Office Can Be Established Two Weeks After This Office</p>
<p>The War Zone Relief Committee of this city originally planned to use the 250,000 yuan of relief funds allocated to specifically handle the lending business in the war zone. However, due to the request of the secondary schools in the war zone that were affected by the disaster, 20,000 yuan was allocated to be used to relieve the secondary schools in the war zone that were affected by the disaster. The municipal commissioners of the disaster-stricken areas all believed that the general public had suffered huge losses due to the impact of the war this time, and they requested to increase the relief funds, which made it difficult to distribute. However, the committee still considered the actual situation and planned as a whole. Recently, it has completely decided on the distribution methods and lending procedures, and decided to convene municipal commissioners from the disaster-stricken areas at 9 am this morning to explain the various methods that the committee has decided to the municipal commissioners and urge them to actively prepare for the lending offices in their respective districts. According to the spokesperson of the committee, the lending offices and the lending sub-offices can be established and start lending in about two weeks. Recently, the general public has been requesting the Social Affairs Bureau for the increase of relief funds. Gu said that the lending office organized this time is directly under the Relief Committee and has nothing to do with the poverty lending office run by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Bo Wenwei's Opinion on Guiding the Huai River (Continued) <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Wenwei returned to Shanghai from Hunan and discussed the issue of guiding the Huai River with the late Premier. The late Premier adopted Wenwei's proposal and included it in the Founding Strategy. It is the public opinion of Jiangsu and Anhui that the Huai River flows into the sea from the Guan River, and it has been reviewed and approved by the late Premier. At the second session of the fourth plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, Wenwei proposed a proposal on guiding the Huai River, and also adopted the opinions of the Jiangsu and Anhui Water Conservancy Association, and drafted a method description. The General Assembly decided and handed it over to the government for execution, but the executors of guiding the Huai River today have never considered Wenwei's proposal. Now, after reading the engineering plan issued by the Huai River Guidance Committee, it advocates guiding the Huai River into the Yangtze River. Since it is known that the Yangtze River cannot accommodate it, it claims to build a gate at the Sanhe Dam to limit the amount of floodwater flowing into the Yangtze River during floods, which is 6,000 cubic meters per second, which is 2,000 cubic meters less than the amount of Huai River flowing into the Yangtze River in the tenth year of the Republic of China. It is called guiding the Huai River, but it is actually storing water, which is already strange. It also claims to build flood embankments and use Hongze as a reservoir to increase its water level capacity for downstream irrigation and hydropower, which is even more terrifying. Reservoirs are advocated by modern engineers, but the upstream must be a sloping area and the downstream must also be a stepped area. Then choose the lowest-lying place and build it as a reservoir, so that the upstream and downstream can benefit from it. The current situation of the Huai River is just the opposite. The upstream Anhui-North Plain is only 13 to 15 meters above sea level. The average height of the bottom of the Huai River in Anhui is about 4 meters, and the bottom of Hongze Lake is 10 meters high, and the water level is more than 15 meters high. The Anhui-North Plain is already 2 meters below the Hongze water level. The ground in the lower He River and the Haizhou Salt River area downstream is 4 meters high. It can be seen that Hongze Lake is not a low-lying area in the upstream and downstream, but a high ground protruding from the upstream and downstream. The harm of the Huai River lies in this. If it is built as a reservoir, I, Yu, think it is definitely not a reservoir, but a water tower, which will inevitably irrigate Anhui and Henan in the upper reaches and breach Huaiyang in the lower reaches to cause a terrible disaster. Last year, the representatives of Anhui attended the meeting and argued according to reason, but the engineering plan issued by the Huai River Guidance Committee has not changed. Recently, Vice Chairman Zhuang also proposed to open up the abandoned Yellow River. It is heard that several million yuan has been raised for the project. The work of abandoning the Yellow River is difficult and costly. Even if billions of yuan are thrown in, it will be useless. American engineers have already said this, so the excavation of the abandoned Yellow River may also be a last resort for perfunctory calculations. Wenwei witnessed the disaster last year and knew that the disaster of the Huai River was becoming more and more urgent. Hundreds of thousands of miles of fertile land in the upper reaches had become barren land. The lowlands of Huaiyang in the lower reaches had begun to collapse and were about to be submerged in the ancient Si land. Jiangsu Province is following the old methods and only knows to block the mouths and repair the embankments. The design of the Huai River guidance team wants to stir up the waves, regardless of the lives and lands of tens of millions of people, for its scientific experiments. The people of the Huai River are ignorant and have never heard of it, which is sad. Guiding the Huai River is not as profound as science. It is just to follow the nature of the water and exit from the low-lying sea mouth. Then the obstacles in the middle stream can be scoured by the upstream water force and artificially excavated to form a new and orderly Huai River, so that the water can flow from the ground. Then the tributaries and ditches can be connected at the same time, just like the veins are connected, and the great benefits of the entire Huai River basin can be developed. If we still use the old wisdom of blocking the flow and building dams to form a high channel for the waste of water to come out of the Yellow River, Jiangsu Province may be spared for a while, but the agricultural benefits of the plains of Henan and Anhui will be lost forever. Wenwei has made many contributions to the opinions on guiding the Huai River since the first year of the Republic of China. Now, I would like to summarize it. A. The Huai River must first flow into the sea from the Guan River. B. The standard for guiding the Huai River is to reduce the current water level of Hongze. C. The design of the new Huai River must be based on the height and slope of the bottom of the Huai River in Anhui. It must slope down and there must be no obstacles in the middle. D. The bottom of Hongze Lake is higher than the upstream, so it cannot be used as a reservoir. E. The Huai River Guidance Committee does not have talents who are familiar with the water conservancy of the Huai River region. It should be reorganized as soon as possible. F. Guiding and reclaiming must be planned as a whole and cannot be divided into two things. A special bureau for guiding and reclaiming should be established to govern the water conservancy administration of the Huai River region to specialize in responsibility. After the guiding and reclaiming is completed, it should be transferred to the central and local agencies. G. Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan should jointly form a Huai River Guidance Association as a design and supervision agency. H. The cost of guiding should be borne by the land reclamation. The public debt should be raised after the cost of labor and the benefits of land reclamation have a definite budget and have been approved by the association. Foreign capital must not be borrowed first to prevent abuse. I. Guiding the Huai River must take into account the interests of the four provinces of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui and coordinate the overall situation. It must be fair and not just take care of one corner, harm other provinces, and treat neighbors as ditches. Everyone is selfish, and years of disputes have not been resolved. This is the biggest problem. I hope that the people of the four provinces will realize this as soon as possible and express their consistent opinions in order to save the past and prevent future disasters. Wenwei is very fortunate, and the Huai River region is very fortunate. Bo Wenwei Qi, October 10, 21st Year of the Republic.</p>

<p>▲ Twenty-Eighth Bao, North Twelfth Map</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau Proclamation No. 28: This bureau is now starting to measure the land in the twenty-eighth bao, north twelfth map of the Zikawei district. All landowners should pay attention to the following items: (1) The land chief will distribute the filling and reporting forms to the landowners. Each landowner should fill in the forms truthfully within ten days after receiving them, and the land chief will collect them and submit them to the No. 1 Measurement Team of this bureau, located next to the Guanyin Temple, east of the Anhe Temple Road, Zikawei Town, or the landowners can directly submit them to the measurement team. (2) If the landowner's address is unknown, so the filling and reporting form cannot be distributed and has not been received, you can go directly to this bureau or the No. 1 Measurement Team to fill in the form yourself. (3) If the landowner's land deed is mortgaged outside, so you cannot fill in the name of the land deed holder and the number of mu, you should quickly copy it from the mortgagee and do not shirk responsibility. (4) When the land of each household is measured, the landowner must, together with the land chief, clearly point out the boundaries to the investigators or surveyors, or entrust a representative in advance to point out the boundaries on site. Otherwise, this bureau will only rely on the land chief's instructions. If there are any errors in the future and disputes arise, the landowner will be responsible. The above four items are all related to the landowner's consolidation of property rights. In addition to informing the land chiefs of the map to abide by them, it is necessary to inform the public so that all landowners pay special attention to this proclamation. October 12, 21st year of the Republic of China. Director Jin Liren.</p>

The Municipal Public Security Bureau ordered the summons of Yi Honglin, Fu Chonghang, and other three executive directors of the First District Water and Electricity Industry Commercial Union to the bureau for questioning at 4 pm yesterday, ordering them to hand over the murderer of the Feng assault case, and they were not released until late.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Foundry Industry Working Hours Trend, Social Affairs Bureau Approves Half-Hour Extension <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>▲ Orders the Guild to Persuade Factories to Proceed</p>
<p>All workers in the foundry industry in this city have been extending working hours by various capitalists in violation of labor-management agreements, resulting in labor unrest. The Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly convened capitalist guilds to advise them. However, because the capitalists insisted that business was sluggish, they insisted on extending the working hours by one hour without paying wages, which resulted in no results. Now, in order to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest, the bureau has specially ordered the Copper and Iron Machinery Industry Guild to strictly order it: "This is to order compliance. According to the petition of the foundry industry trade union, the provisions of Article 3 of the industry's labor-management agreement regarding working hours are not fulfilled by most factories. Please verify." It is hereby verified that the Factory Law clearly stipulates that extending working hours requires payment of wages. Moreover, since an agreement has been signed, how can it be violated? Now the labor side is considering the current business difficulties and is willing to sacrifice half an hour of wages if necessary. If it does not exceed nine and a half hours, there is no need to pay extra wages. Its spirit of cooperation is deeply appreciated. However, the factories are greedy and have not yet agreed, which is very wrong. The previous situation has been reported again. It is appropriate to order you to immediately persuade the factories to strictly implement the methods set by the union to avoid disputes, and there must be no mistakes. The handling situation should also be reported back for investigation. This order is also approved for the union to be informed.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Public Document Strictly Prohibiting Tobacco Planting <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>▲ Officials Obey Orders Publicly But Disobey Them Privately, Military Law Will Be Enforced.</p>
<p>▲ Inspections Will Be Conducted Within the Territory of Each Province This Year.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has respectfully received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, which was forwarded from the Provincial Government, stating that it had received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, saying that the provinces and counties disregarded the pros and cons and planted opium for a long time. Persisting in this self-destructive behavior would not only reduce food production but also harm people's health, inevitably leading to national collapse and racial extinction, leaving no hope for remedy. Every time he thought about it, he felt deeply grieved. Therefore, he hereby reiterates the strict prohibition, hoping that military and civilian officials at all levels will be inspired, work hard, and earnestly implement it, requiring all opium seedlings within the province to be eradicated and completely cleared within the time limit after the document arrives, and never be replanted. If anyone obeys orders publicly but disobeys them privately, or openly prohibits but secretly allows it, once discovered, the highest-ranking military officer stationed in the county and the county magistrate will be dealt with according to military law, and the provincial chairman will be punished for ordering private planting. In addition to ordering the Party and Government Committee of this department and consulting the central competent authority to first dispatch investigators to conduct on-the-spot inspections within the territory of each province this year and to conduct successive inspections, they are urgently ordered to strictly comply and instruct all subordinate county governments and military units stationed in each county to comply and publicize this to all. This matter concerns a specially ordered important policy, so do not neglect or violate it, lest it incur punishment. Therefore, the County Government, after receiving the order, yesterday issued instructions to all district chiefs and public security branch chiefs to strictly investigate and prohibit it and also publicized it to the residents of the county, informing everyone.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Completion of the New Building of the Special District Court <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲ Designed by Architect Yang Xiliu</p>
<p>In recent years, the First Special District Court of this port has been facing increasingly busy litigation affairs, and the original courthouse was insufficient. During his tenure, the former president of the court, Mr. Yang Zhaoyun, specifically requested funds from the Ministry to construct a new building. Since the current president, Mr. Zhou, took office, he has been actively promoting the project, which was completed last month. The Ministry of Justice sent personnel to inspect and accept the building, which was put into use this month. The building is a five-story steel-concrete structure, with a magnificent exterior and a spacious interior, including four large courtrooms, offices, lawyers' rooms, a repository for stolen goods, and a document storage room, all of which are quite complete. The total cost of construction was over 90,000 taels of silver, and it was designed by architect Yang Xiliu and built by the Renchang Construction Company.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Shanghai Municipal Council Investigates Methods of Regulating Movies <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, considering that there are still many points to consider regarding the movies currently being shown in the Settlement, even after inspection, specifically hired Mrs. A.M. Cannao, Mrs. P.C. Colman, and Mrs. A.E. Lunkley in April of this year to form an investigative committee to study the management of movies and the issue of movie inspection. The committee has held 15 meetings, summoned many witnesses to inquire about everything, and reviewed various suggestions and referenced methods from other places. The investigation has now been completed, and a report has been prepared and submitted to the Municipal Council. After receiving the report, the Council expressed its gratitude for the committee's hard work. The report is quite lengthy, and the following is a summary of its main points:</p>
<p>▲ Shortcomings of the Current System: The purpose of movie inspection is not to question the value of the content of the film, but only to ask whether it is suitable for public screening in the area. The current method of inspection is carried out by personnel from the police department, and the handling is still good, but it is too heavy a burden for low-ranking police officers to bear this responsibility, and the work is also very tight (an average of 50 full-length films and about 40 short films are inspected each month). Although there is an "International Inspection Committee," there is little contact with the inspectors of the police department. At the time of preview, no committee members are present because the number of committee members is too large, scattered, and powerless.</p>
<p>▲ Suggestion to Form Another Committee: The investigative committee advocates that a formal and powerful committee should be formed. Its organization should include one senior police officer each from the Public Concession and the French Concession, one representative from the Consular Body, one member jointly recommended by various women's public organizations, and one member each separately dispatched by the two concessions (preferably a legal, medical, or educational professional). When necessary, experts can be hired. Preliminary inspection should be carried out by personnel dispatched by the police departments of the two concessions (the two concessions must cooperate fully, and the right to approve or disapprove the screening must be in the hands of the two police chiefs). Each time a preview is held, in addition to the police department inspector, one member of the committee should be present. If the member does not agree with the police officer's decision, he or she may order the film to be resubmitted to the committee for review. The signed certificate of approval by the committee should be shown during the screening. As for the term of office of the committee members, it should be at least one year. Except for those who are concurrently serving as council members, their work should be rewarded. The investigative committee also suggests that the Municipal Council set up its own screening room to avoid the trouble of inspectors running around. The equipment for this room would cost about 60,000 taels of silver, but the cost can be covered by a slight entertainment tax or a handling fee.</p>
<p>▲ National Sentiment Should Be Considered: The investigative committee believes that it is difficult to set strict rules for the standards of inspection. However, in Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather, special attention should be paid to the relationship of national sentiment. Furthermore, films that incite Easterners to despise Westerners or Westerners to despise Easterners must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>▲ Impact of Films on Young People: The investigative committee found that films of the bandit type have little impact on children, but films depicting sensuality are very harmful. The Chinese student class is greatly affected by them. Therefore, it is advocated that films be divided into two categories: one marked with the letter "U," which can be watched by everyone, and one marked with the letter "A," which is only for adults to watch. As for the age standard, it seems that 16 years old can also be used as a limit.</p>
<p>▲ Pictorial Advertisements Should Be Reformed: The huge pictorial advertisements posted by cinemas on the roadside are often overly exaggerated and often not very elegant. Although the cinema side first submits a reduced version of the advertisement to the inspector for review, the impression is very different between the large and small versions. The investigative committee suggests that all theaters stop using pictorial advertisements and use only text advertisements, at least for a trial period, to see if it affects the number of viewers. Also, the pictorial advertisements in newspapers can all be canceled.</p>
<p>▲ Improve the Content of Films: The value of films is not something that inspectors should overly concern themselves with. In the United States, there is a federation of women's clubs that publishes a film report every month, which is sufficient to indicate which films are not suitable for children to watch and which are suitable to watch. If this method is imitated in Shanghai, it will be effective in the long run. Also, in Australia, all film distributors must be registered, and if they violate the rules, their licenses can be revoked. Furthermore, the number of educational films currently shown in Shanghai is extremely small. The investigative committee believes that if this type of film is used as a short film and shown between newsreels and main films, it will be very beneficial to children.</p>
<p>In the appendix of the report, there is a written opinion from Chrisill and Hanah, representatives of the Film Federation, stating that the Municipal Council has no legal right to conduct inspections and that the Council has never inspected theaters and publications.</p>
<h3 id="e175">The French Concession Begins Vaccination <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Lai Baode, Director General of Public Health and Relief of the French Municipal Council, in order to prevent smallpox, has specially begun free vaccinations from the 15th of this month, except on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, at the following three places: (1) the French Municipal Council Clinic, 630 Beile Road; (2) the French Municipal Council Health Center, 840 Xujiahui Road; (3) the French Concession Epidemic Prevention Vehicle. It is hoped that each household within the Concession will instruct its men and women to go to the above places for vaccination to avoid infection. As for employees of factories, restaurants, and the like, they must be vaccinated at the Beile Road Clinic and issued a certificate. If anyone is unable to spare time during working hours, please immediately write to the Clinic to request personnel to be sent for vaccination, and they will be dealt with immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Foreign Opinion Agency Issues a Statement <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>▲ Correcting Misinformation Regarding the Agency's News</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Truth Bookstore was raided. It said that on August 27, the Public Security Bureau found the Truth Bookstore at No. 90 Messerdiro Road (corner of Rue Lupan), which specializes in selling Communist books and promoting Communist ideology. It sent a letter to the French police station, requesting assistance in the search and arrest, and stated that "the Foreign Opinion Translation Agency and the Theater Association are also affiliated to the bookstore upstairs and are both suspicious." The Foreign Opinion Translation Agency believes that this matter is of great concern to the agency's reputation and has issued a statement to correct the misinformation. The agency was established in early April and subleased the third floor of the building at the above address from the Theater Association. The Theater Association originally rented the space from the former Green House Tea Room. Later, when the Green House closed, a person named Xiao Shuzi subleased the storefront from the original owner and opened the Truth Bookstore. The agency and the Theater Association still deal directly with the original owner for rent payment based on the contractual relationship. The agency's personnel have a separate side door and have nothing to do with the Truth Bookstore. Moreover, the agency and the Theater Association were established before the bookstore, so the statement that they are affiliated with the bookstore is incorrect. The agency was established with the aim of introducing foreign opinions to make Chinese people understand the attitudes of foreigners so that they know how to deal with them. At the beginning of its establishment, it separately submitted reports to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the French Police Station for record and applied to the Municipal Government to consult the Ministry of Interior for registration. Since its publication, it has received the patronage and praise of party and state officials and social celebrities. The translated manuscripts are provided to newspapers, and central, provincial, and municipal party and government agencies have subscriptions (the Public Security Bureau also has a subscription). The scope of dissemination extends as far as Chahar, Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Guangxi, and Guizhou. The agency does not deny whether it is suspicious and is willing to make public all the manuscripts stored in the past six months for inspection to clarify the truth. According to news from the police station, when the Public Security Bureau sent investigator Zhou to the police station on that day and mentioned No. 90 Messerdiro Road, the police station immediately asked which of the thirteen households at No. 90 was involved. The person replied that it was only the Truth Bookstore on the ground floor. The police station then sent police detectives to accompany the search, so the feet of the search personnel did not step on the stairs. The agency's employees were able to enter and exit without any hindrance. The newspaper report is actually misinformation. Fearing that it will be spread and affect the agency's reputation, the agency has issued the above statement.</p>

<p>The movie star Ms. Hu Die previously had a cosmetics company use her name and photo as a trademark. The Family Industrial Company strongly opposed this because it sounded like "Invincible" from the "Invincible Brand", citing trademark law. The written arguments between the two companies have appeared in newspapers several times. For the past two months, the matter has gradually subsided. It is now reported that the Family Industrial Company has prepared all the necessary procedures and formally filed an objection with the Trademark Bureau to revoke the cosmetics company's Hu Die trademark.</p>

<h3 id="e178">The Da Yun Steamer Capsizes in Baozhen, Between Shanghai and Chongming <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>▲ More Than 200 Passengers Rescued</p>
<p>▲ Approximately Eighty People Drowned</p>
<p>The Chongming ferry "Da Yun" belonging to the Da Yun Steamer Company of Shanghai's South City capsized yesterday morning in Baozhen Harbor while en route from Chongming to Shanghai, resulting in the drowning of nearly one hundred passengers. Our reporter specifically visited the company to thoroughly investigate the matter, and the details of the accident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Top-Heaviness: The "Da Yun" departed from Chongming at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, carrying 600 bales of cotton at Nanhang Port, destined for the Datong Textile Mill in Baozhen Harbor. The cotton was loaded on the deck, while the cabins inside the ship were empty, carrying only more than 300 passengers. As a result, the ship became top-heavy, with the deck being heavier than the hull. The "Da Yun" was passing through Er Tiao Shu and Xin Kaihe to dock at Baozhen Harbor at 9:20 AM. Just as the ship was dropping anchor, it unexpectedly capsized due to the impact of the tide, resulting in a major tragedy.</p>
<p>▲ Ship Lies on its Side: The "Da Yun" docked at the Baozhen Harbor pier at 9:25 AM. The stern cable had already been secured, and passengers were coming out of the cabins towards the left side of the deck, preparing to disembark. Unexpectedly, at this moment, the tide was surging, causing the ship to lean inward. It was hit by the tide, causing the "Da Yun" to suddenly fall sideways towards the pier and instantly capsize, lying flat on the river surface. Many items from inside the ship fell into the harbor.</p>
<p>▲ Passengers Fall into the Water: When the "Da Yun" capsized, the stern cable did not break. Initially, the ship's smokestack rested on the pier, causing the ship to lie flat on the harbor surface. The total number of passengers on board, including those who disembarked at Nanmen Port (over eighty), Er Tiao Shu (over forty), and Xin Kaihe (over fifty), was approximately three hundred. Among them, some who had already reached the deck also fell into the water when the ship capsized. Except for the crew, sailors, and passengers who jumped onto the pier during the capsizing, at least two hundred seventy or eighty people fell into the water on the spot.</p>
<p>▲ Some Rescued: Those who fell into the water from the deck were mostly close to the pier, making it easier to rescue them. On the spot, local fishermen from the pier rescued over one hundred people. At that time, the "Yong Zhou" ferry, which was also en route to Shanghai, arrived at Baozhen Harbor. Seeing the "Da Yun" capsized, the owner of the "Yong Zhou", Pang Canlin, quickly released sampans to assist in the rescue, rescuing more than twenty passengers who had fallen into the water. A sailboat also rescued more than thirty people. The "Da Yun's" rowing boats also rescued more than thirty people. According to Pang Canlin, who spoke to our reporter, he personally saw the rescue of about two hundred twenty passengers. Finally, the "Yong Zhou" ferry also rescued two passengers, Xu Zhengfu and others, as well as a suitcase from the harbor. The suitcase has been brought to Shanghai, awaiting identification.</p>
<p>▲ Number of Casualties: Many passengers in the "Da Yun" have not been rescued. After the ship capsized, it moved outwards and the hull was submerged in the water, with the smokestack also submerged. Passengers inside the cabins who did not have time to escape were mostly trapped inside the ship. The doors of each cabin were closed, making it impossible to open them. Those trapped inside the ship were certain to have all died. Currently, the company has not provided an exact number, but according to eyewitnesses, it is estimated that the number of crew and passengers who drowned inside the ship and in the water is about seventy or eighty. When the "Yong Zhou" ferry left Shanghai, it still saw victims poking their heads out of the ventilation holes in the ship, crying out for help, but there was no way to get them out. Alas!</p>
<p>▲ Ferries Dispatched for Rescue: Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Da Yun Company received a telegram reporting the accident, but the message was very brief, only saying that the "Da Yun" carrying 600 bales of cotton capsized in Baozhen. Upon receiving the news, the assistant manager, Du Shaoshi, personally took the company's "Dalian" ferry to Baozhen Harbor for inspection and to discuss rescue methods. According to Mr. Lu of the company, details would be available at 4:00 AM this morning, when Mr. Du returns to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Ship Submerged: The "Yong Zhou" ferry left Baozhen Harbor at approximately 11:00 AM, seeing that the "Da Yun" had already capsized in the harbor. The stern cable was still secured, with the bow facing southeast and the stern facing northwest, about fifty or sixty feet from the pier. The front of the "Da Yun's" hull was still exposed above the water by about three feet, while the stern was submerged and out of sight. The "Da Yun" was built by the Yongyu Company in 1921, with a load capacity of 287 tons, a displacement of 311 tons, a length of 142 feet, a width of 25 feet, and a draft of 7 feet 4 inches. The engine was a two-linked type, with a 400-horsepower engine.</p>
<p>▲ Overview of Losses: This time, the "Da Yun" only had 600 bales of cotton on board, and there were not many goods inside the ship. However, the luggage and belongings of the passengers and crew inside the ship were all lost. Therefore, including the loss of the ship itself, the total loss is estimated at sixty to seventy thousand yuan. The ship was not insured. The shipowner Yang Asan, the chief mate Chen Yunlong, and the second mate Hong Fusheng, are reported to have all escaped and are now in Baozhen Harbor.</p>

<p>▲ The Detention Center Released the Wrong Criminal</p>
<p>▲ The Murderer was Substituted and Released</p>
<p>Ling Jiannan, the owner of a leather shoe store in Ximen Ningkangli, was axed to death by Chen Tugen (formerly a lottery tout), a detective from the reformed Public Security Bureau, Wang Wencai, out of personal revenge. The widow captured the murderer Chen Tugen on the spot and sent him to the District Court for detention. At the same time, the widow also sued Wang Wencai and the old man Huang Zicheng. The case is still under investigation. Unexpectedly, on September 1st, another lottery boatman, also named Chen Tugen, claimed to be an apprentice of the Chen Tugen in the murder case. Originally, he was not surnamed Chen Tugen, but somehow he was deliberately arrested and also sent to the District Court under the same name. After investigation and prosecution, he was sentenced to fifteen days of detention. After deducting the number of days of detention, there were few days left. The court then ordered the detention center to carry out the sentence. The murderer Chen Tugen was detained in cell number 9, while the lottery Chen Tugen was detained in cell number 11. However, due to the detention center's previous mistake in releasing the wrong criminal, all defendants were photographed to avoid errors. Unexpectedly, the two Chen Tugens switched cells. Until five days ago, the lottery Chen Tugen should have been released. Unexpectedly, the murderer Chen Tugen was substituted and released. The officials in the detention center did not check or inquire, resulting in the escape of a serious offender. It has now come to light, but there is no way to find him. However, the widow Ling Ni has learned about this from outside and has hired a lawyer to file a complaint. However, the warden stated that if anyone can capture Chen Tugen, he is willing to offer a large reward.</p>
<h3 id="e180">10,000 Gold Scam <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>▲ Using Gambling to Deceive and Obtain Wealth</p>
<p>▲ 10,000 Gold Lost in an Instant</p>
<p>Lu Shichang, the owner of the Yueji Construction Company at No. 51 Putuo Road, also operates a real estate business. Previously, through the introduction of Wang Guangfu and Zhang Xuesheng, he met Zhang Jiayue from Zhejiang for buying and selling land. They interacted with each other and gradually became familiar. At noon on the 8th of this month, when Lu went to Zhang's residence on Baek Road for a visit, Xu Ziqing happened to be visiting as well. During their conversation, Lu learned that Xu was settling his gambling debts from the previous night with Zhang. Zhang took a bundle of banknotes and returned them to Xu. After Xu left, Zhang told Lu about Xu's background, saying that Xu had a brother who had recently come to Shanghai and was addicted to gambling and extremely extravagant. Although his wealth was abundant, it would be difficult to maintain it for long. Instead of letting him waste it, they could use some means to obtain it. If they obtained the money, they could donate it to charity, which would be more beneficial than wasting it on empty pleasures. Lu was moved by his words. Zhang, knowing his intention, continued, "I have already arranged a gambling game, but I need a large sum of money. After repeated preparations, I am still short of over 10,000 gold. Please lend me the money temporarily. After the game is over, I will return it and give you a small reward." Lu agreed. On the afternoon of the 11th, Lu brought 10,000 yuan and handed it over to Zhang and Xu for gambling. In a short time, Zhang lost heavily and his funds were exhausted. Zhang comforted Lu, saying, "I will have a large sum of money coming in soon, and I will find a way to return the money I borrowed from you." Lu silently returned home. After thinking about it all night, the next morning he reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station and sent detectives Zhao Rongsen and Wu Changkai to Baek Road to arrest Zhang and Xu Boming and confiscate various items. They were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Zhen interrogated them. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case and requested a postponement for investigation. When questioned, the defendants completely denied the charges and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend them, requesting bail. Judge Wu stated that the case still needed investigation and ordered the defendants to be detained and postponed the hearing.</p>

After a while, the two people in Chinese clothing got out of the car and waited on the side of the road. Suddenly, one person came out and was forced into the car by the two people in Chinese clothing, which sped off north. The car's license plate was 5512. The incident was witnessed by the doorman at that location, who immediately reported it to the police station, which is currently investigating. Who was kidnapped will be reported later.</p>

<p>The Yonghua Company, located at the entrance of Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession, is deeply concerned about the fact that the compatriots in Northeast China who have been affected by the disaster lack clothing and food, and because autumn is about to pass and severe winter is approaching, it has specially decided to donate 5% of its retail sales revenue from yesterday to the 15th (a total of three days) to the Shanghai Association for Relief of Northeast China Refugees, which will be remitted to the disaster area for distribution in order to provide relief.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Exchange Association had a dispute with the director of the Shanghai Shishi Tobacco and Wine Branch Bureau over the issue of obtaining licenses and submitted a request to the Tax Office to remove him from office and investigate him. The Tax Office issued a response yesterday, the original text of which is as follows: We have received the submission. Previously, we have already clearly indicated in our response to the submission from the association that if the branch bureau collects license taxes in accordance with the regulations, how can the association overstep its authority to take on the task of collecting taxes and submitting them on behalf of the merchants? This is inappropriate. We urge you to instruct the merchants to promptly comply with the regulations and go to the bureau to pay their taxes, and not to use excuses to resist, lest they be punished. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Henan Red Spear Society Bandit Provincial Wang Huiming Released by Public Security Bureau <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Henan Provincial Government captured Red Spear Society ringleader Wang Huiming and others around August of this year. According to their confessions, their organization was based in Shanghai. To thoroughly eradicate the evil, the provincial authorities requested the Shanghai Municipal Government's assistance in investigation and arrest. The Municipal Government instructed the Public Security Bureau to dispatch detectives, who, on the 23rd of last month, in conjunction with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Public Concession Police, secretly went to the organization established by the bandit in Huade Road, arrested Wang Shaolin, a member of the society, and sent him to the Second Branch of the High Court for interrogation. Because the Municipal Public Security Bureau applied to transfer the bandit for questioning, they were ordered to present evidence for further review. Yesterday morning, presiding Judge Yu Hua and Assessors Zhao and Guo of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court held another hearing. Attorney Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Public Security Bureau, presented a copy of Wang Huiming's confession, proving that the defendant was indeed an accomplice of the criminals captured in Henan Province. However, when questioned, Wang Shaolin denied being a bandit and claimed not to know Wang Huiming. Subsequently, Attorney Li Zhishan of the police stated that the Municipal Public Security Bureau's attorney had presented substantial evidence, which was credible, and the police agreed to the request for transfer. The defendant's defense attorney then rose to object, arguing that the defendant's crime occurred in the Public Concession and should be under the jurisdiction of the court. The Public Security Bureau's request for transfer was illegal and violated the agreement. Attorney Zhan immediately rebutted, stating that the defendant was a co-conspirator in the bandit organization uncovered by the Henan Provincial Government. According to the law, the official agency that first prosecutes has the jurisdiction to try accomplices, without doubt. To say that it violates the agreement is even more unfounded. The agreement was made between the national government and the consular body, and the Municipal Council represents the interests of the consular body. Now that the Municipal Council's attorney has expressed agreement, it is inappropriate for the national attorney to claim that it violates the agreement. The defense's position is inconsistent. The transfer of the defendant to the Public Security Bureau is in accordance with the agreement and procedures. Judge Yu then adjourned with the assessors for about ten minutes. Upon returning to the bench, he announced that Wang Shaolin should be allowed to be taken by the Public Security Bureau for investigation and handling. Upon hearing the verdict, the defendant's attorney immediately requested a temporary stay of execution in order to file an appeal. After consultation with the presiding judge and assessors, Judge Yu rejected the request in court and ordered Wang Shaolin to be taken away by detectives from the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Russian Prisoner Who Caused Trouble in Jail Sentenced <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Six Russian prisoners, Le Wenqing Gao, Xia Yinggong Siding, Shi Benduofu, Xikejin Yiwang, Siniyafosi Ji, and Keluotu, were arrested for theft and gambling in the French Concession and sent to the Second Special Court. After interrogation, they were sentenced to imprisonment and served their sentences in the Second Special District Prison. However, the Russian prisoners were quite restless in prison. Le Wenqing Gao used an iron hook from the window to make a key, intending to open the prison door to escape. This was seen by a Chinese prisoner, who reported it to the warden, who stopped them. As a result, the Russian prisoners hated the Chinese prisoner. At 5 PM on the 2nd of this month, they ganged up and beat Xu Tongji, a Chinese prisoner in the same cell, and damaged the doors and walls. The warden sent Le and the other six to the Police Department and then to the Second Special Court, where they were prosecuted for attempted escape and assault. After Judge Li Changnian held a trial and announced the end of the debate, yesterday, Le Wenqing Gao was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for damaging the equipment of the detention facility and attempting to escape, and two months of imprisonment for assault, with a combined sentence of four months of imprisonment. Xia Yinggong Siding was sentenced to 20 days of detention for assault. Shi Benduofu, Xikejin Yiwang, Siniyafosi Ji, and Keluotu were found not guilty, and the fake key and iron hook were confiscated.</p>

<p>▲ Cai Yousen Has the Face of a Beast</p>
<p>▲ Hongde Church Practices Righteousness and Collects Funds</p>
<p>▲ The Children's Welfare Association Implements Relief</p>
<p>▲ Zhuji County Makes Every Effort to Help</p>
<p>Hongde Church on Doule'an Road in this city was where Pastor Jiang Shixu and Secretary Cai Youzhai of the Christian Church, were martyred during the January 28th Incident of this year. Mr. Cai was from Zhuji. His wife died early, leaving only three daughters: the eldest, Zhizhen, 17 years old; the second, Renzhen, 14 years old; and the youngest, Yongzhen, 12 years old. Father and daughters depended on each other for life. After his sudden and tragic death, the three orphaned girls were cared for by Hongde Church, which practiced righteousness and raised funds to support them. Zhizhen, being older, was sent to the Women and Children's Hospital to learn nursing. Renzhen and Yongzhen, being younger, were sent to Xinde School to study. In July, Cai Youlin, claiming to be Youzhai's younger brother, came to the church to visit his nieces. The church immediately sent someone to guide him to Xinde School and notified the principal to let Renzhen and Yongzhen meet him, confirming that he was their uncle. The next day, Yousen went to the school alone and asked the principal for a week's leave to take the two girls back to their ancestral home in Zhuji to comfort their grandmother, who longed to see her granddaughters. The principal trusted him without doubt and handed the two girls over to Yousen to take back. Unexpectedly, there was no news. It was then discovered that Cai Yousen had used the grandmother's name to deceive the two girls and hide them in Puliwu, near Fengqiao Town in Zhuji, with the intention of selling them. On September 30th, Cai Zhizhen tearfully appealed to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, requesting relief. The association immediately selected representatives to prepare a document requesting the Zhuji County government to assist in the investigation and punish the crime according to law. County Magistrate Wang immediately sent police to accompany the representatives to Puliwu for investigation. The whereabouts of the two girls were discovered, and a price of 150 yuan each had been agreed upon, and the deal was about to be concluded. The police immediately rescued the two girls, and Cai Yousen escaped upon hearing the news. The representatives could not stay long and sent a letter to the county government requesting that the two orphaned girls be handed over to them to be taken back to their original school in Shanghai to study, and requesting that Cai Yousen be arrested and brought to justice. The county magistrate approved the request. The representatives brought Renzhen and Yongzhen back to Shanghai on Double Tenth Day. The director of Hongde Church requested that the two orphaned girls be sent to the Children's Welfare Association for resettlement. The association, being responsible for children's welfare, immediately sent the two girls to the Children's Welfare Education Institute's Children's Welfare Primary School to study. The two orphans were thus saved from danger. As for Cai Yousen's inhumane actions, it is hoped that County Magistrate Wang will arrest him and punish him according to law, to satisfy the public.</p>

<p>▲ Identification of Those Burned to Death in Zhabei: At the intersection of Jinling Road and Minli Road in Zhabei, there were dozens of shacks inhabited by poor people from Jiangbei. Around 9 or 10 PM the day before yesterday, a fire broke out in the home of Chen Han and Chen Zhong due to leftover embers from cooking and accumulated firewood. Because the wind was strong and the shacks were dry, over thirty shacks were burned down. The fire brigade arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire. Chen Bifuzu's ten-year-old son, Changfu, and Wu Sanbao's five-year-old son, Sanjiuzi, were unable to escape and were burned to death. Yesterday, the bodies were dug out, and the person who started the fire was detained in the Second Precinct of the Fourth District. The local guarantor, Shen Xiaohe, and the local court reported the matter for identification.</p>
<p>▲ Drowning Victim in Nanshi Awaiting Identification: In the Nanshi Dongjiadu ferry terminal, at 10 AM the day before yesterday, a ferry loaded with passengers was heading to Pudong when it collided with a Ningbo boat driven by Gao Changfa, Tian Dafa, Wang Xinlou, and others. The collision caused passengers Ji Changbao, 19 years old, from Dantu, and Fu Weiqiao, 23 years old, from Dongting Mountain, to fall into the Huangpu River and drown. Two bicycles belonging to Wang Jinji and Gu Qiufen also fell into the river and disappeared. The water patrol team detained the ferry owner and sent them to the court.

<h3 id="e191">Pimping Girls to Qingfapu Brothels Under the Pretense of Filming Movies <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fu Xiuqing Fortunately Redeemed by a Patron</p>
<p>▲ Huang Dianru Sentenced to Three Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old Xiuqing, daughter of Yong woman Fu Xu, residing at No. 38 Zhaofeng Road, was tricked by Chen Xiaofang, a Zhenjiang man who had been arrested, and his mistress Ni A'yu, into going to Qingjiangpu under the pretense of filming a movie in August of last year. She was sold to a brothel as a prostitute. Later, she was redeemed by a patron, Yang Minggao, who sent Xiuqing back to Shanghai. The two defendants confessed that a man named Wang also went to sell the girl. The detective Shen Binkui, who was handling the case, found out that the suspect's name was Huang Dianru (nickname Huang Deye), 38 years old, and he was hiding at No. 196 Chongqing Road. He reported to the former head detective and, with the cooperation of a Western detective, secretly went to the address and arrested Huang, taking him to the Huishan Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police attorney Zhang Tianyin stated the previous events, saying that the defendant had been identified by the victim Fu Xiuqing and the accomplices Chen Xiaofang and Ni A'yu as the Wang who went to the Qingjiangpu brothel to sell Fu. They were all present in court today. According to Fu Xiuqing, Ni A'yu tricked me out, and the next day Chen Xiaofang, Ni A'yu, and the defendant went to Zhenjiang, staying in a certain hotel for three nights. They asked me to go to Qingjiangpu to film a movie. I knew something was wrong and didn't want to go, but the defendant beat me. I had to go and was sold to a brothel, forced to become a prostitute. The madam's name was Tianxi, and I lived a life of prostitution for two months until a patron named Yang redeemed me and sent me to Shanghai. I heard that the Yang family runs a bowl shop in Qingjiangpu and is not currently in Shanghai. According to the Yong woman Ni A'yu, who had been arrested, the defendant, nicknamed Huang Deye, was a friend of Chen Xiaofang, my lover. He indeed introduced Fu Xiuqing to the brothel in Qingjiangpu and even wanted to sell me to the brothel as well, but Chen Xiaofang did not agree. According to Chen Xiaofang, the defendant went to Qingjiangpu with me, where his friend Cai Xiaodazi brokered the sale of Fu as a prostitute. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive. After Judge Shen Bingrong verified the confession, he sentenced Huang Dianru to three years of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>▲ Sixth District Police Provide Rescue Without Accepting Rewards</p>
<p>At 10 PM the night before last, Yao Zengliang, a student at Daxia University in western Shanghai, was walking to the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Columbia Road when he was suddenly surrounded by four robbers. Just as he was in danger, Sergeant Song Ziming of the Singapore Road Police Station in the Sixth District, along with police officer Zhao Changxi, passed by on patrol. The robbers were startled and fled. Sergeant Song and others accompanied Yao to Route Dufour. Yao offered ten yuan and a gold watch as a reward, but Sergeant Song and the others refused. The next day, Yao sent a letter to District Chief Tan Baoshou, stating that he was fortunate to have been rescued by Officer No. 300 and Policeman No. 3400 of your district the previous night and offered a reward, but they refused. He was deeply grateful and sent this letter to request commendation. District Chief Tan has submitted the letter to the General Bureau for review.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Li Bofen Accused of Starting and Then Abandoning <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fellow Villager's Plight is Pitiable</p>
<p>▲ Li Bofen Fails to Appear Despite Summons</p>
<p>Li Bofen, a 49-year-old employee of the Silver Department of Wing On Company, originally from Guangdong, was recently accused by Li Suwen (aka Xu Suwen), a 20-year-old woman from the same village, through attorneys Wu Chengyu and Gan Lin, of seducing a virgin and intentionally abandoning her. She requested that he be punished according to law and filed a civil suit demanding alimony. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi convened a hearing in the Second Criminal Court. According to Chinese constable Guo Xiangyao, he went to the Silver Department of Wing On Company yesterday and ordered the defendant Li Bofen to be summoned. Li signed the summons himself, but he did not appear today. According to the plaintiff Li Suwen, in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China, when I was only 17 years old, I met Li through sweet talk and secret words. From then on, my purity was compromised, and we rented a house to live together. On May 16th of the following year, after giving birth to a son, I suddenly fell ill. The defendant sent me to Anson Hospital. After I recovered slightly, Li lured me back home to live together. But Li already had a wife. When I found out, I regretted it, but it was too late. I could only lament my misfortune. However, the defendant's wife was extremely fierce and often abused me. I couldn't bear to live with her, so I asked the defendant to provide funds for me to live separately. However, the defendant was ungrateful and even suggested that I find other pleasures. His intention to abandon me was obvious. Now that I live separately, the defendant refuses to pay for my living expenses, so I eke out a living, and my life is extremely difficult. I request that he be ordered to pay alimony. After Judge Wu verified the confession, because the defendant was not present, he ordered the case to be rescheduled for October 22nd to summon the defendant and Dr. Hong of Anson Hospital for further verification.</p>

<p>Female scholars Zheng Zhenduo, Chen Naiqian, and others, aware that ancient Chinese books have repeatedly suffered destruction and that rare editions are only occasionally circulated but are too expensive to collect, and that publishers are only interested in profit and will not print books unless they are sure of sales, have organized the Zhenzhen Society, dedicated to selecting and printing rare editions from the past three hundred years that have never been reprinted. They do not limit themselves to any category and will initially print only one hundred copies of each type. The first products are facsimiles of three Ming Dynasty engraved illustrated romances (the first is Tu Long's "Xiuwen Ji," the second is Fan Shiyan's "Mingzhong Ji," and the third is Shen Ciyin's "Chuanxiao Ji"). The illustrations are meticulous, and the engraving and printing are exquisite, making them the best among Ming Dynasty books. The themes are all original in the world of romance, and together they form a perfect combination. The end includes new postscripts by Zheng and Chen, which provide detailed textual research on the books and authors, further increasing the reader's interest. Each set is finely bound in six volumes, with a cloth case, and because only one hundred copies are printed, the cost is 10 yuan. The distribution address is Zhenzhen Society, No. 55 Boulevard de Boileau.</p>

<h3 id="e207">One Can Become a Gentleman Simply by Wearing a Parisian Hat <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— ·Jing· Record</p>
<p>Elder Xiang advocates for national standardized clothing, short for men and long for women, using improved fabrics of silk and hemp as raw materials. The following are the reasons he gives:</p>
<p>"Wearing clothes is an indispensable thing in life: it's a pity we don't pay enough attention to it. With a little adjustment, we can obtain a universally accepted uniform in society.</p>
<p>Because the quality of clothing is not a matter of material but rather a matter of fashion. Once it becomes a common style of dress, no one discusses its quality anymore. Do you think so?"</p>
<p>I agreed and continued, "When I was at Beijing Normal University, I wore a light green student uniform, the style and material of which were very bad, even worse than what the postmen wore; but everyone was happy to wear it because outsiders could tell at a glance that they were from the highest education institution!"</p>
<p>Elder Xiang nodded, smiled, and continued,</p>
<p>"Therefore, my proposal for standardized clothing is even more valid! It is best to be nationally standardized, short for men and long for women. Our country produces a lot of silk and hemp, let experts study and make clothing materials; in this way, national clothing can also promote domestic goods, wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?"</p>
<p>A few days later, a guest came and talked about this issue. In addition to restating his views and reasons, Elder Xiang also told a little anecdote:</p>
<p>"Italians mostly wear silk goods because they can also produce a lot of silk. But foreigners who pay attention to fashion want to imitate the French. Once, someone came to visit me, took off his hat, and said it was a Parisian hat, proving that he was a gentleman! How can one become a gentleman simply by wearing a Parisian hat? Everyone, guess!"</p>

<p>— ·Yun·Sun</p>
<p>|Snippets from the Shanghai Battle|</p>
<p>The beautiful tale of Hua Mulan joining the army, I believe, is a timeless legend. Wu Mulan is the most ardent advocate of the women's movement! Although her actions are comparable to Hua Mulan, the troops she leads are still women. She is merely the leader of an all-female army. As for Miss Mulan, the daughter of Hu Hanmin, and the many others who use "Mulan" as their elegant name, they only admire "Mulan" as a person, at most playing a game of cross-dressing.</p>
<p>During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council, adhering to the spirit of the Boy Scouts, organized a battlefield service team, venturing deep into the line of fire to make a living. Soon, due to the vastness of the battlefield, the comrades were insufficient, so they temporarily trained a group of strong young men. Among them was Comrade Wang Kangfu, a new recruit. Initially, he was assigned to a shelter, and later to the dispatch section of the transportation department. Comrade Kangfu's work was truly astonishing! He traveled between Jiading, Nanxiang, Shanghai, and Liuhe faster than the other comrades. He had no special talents. He drove a recovery vehicle like lightning. When everyone rode horses and whipped them, he followed closely. When everyone slept together, he did not hesitate. Sometimes, when the comrades were tired and their bodies were dirty, they invited him to the bathhouse in town for a bath, and he agreed generously, but when it came to actually taking a bath, he declined.</p>
<p>Half a year later, we only recently discovered that Comrade Wang Kangfu, with whom we spent three months together, was a woman in disguise. A colleague of his told me that, according to his recollection, Wang Kangfu showed no signs of being female. Most noticeably, her breasts were like a man's, and her demeanor was purely masculine. She now has a lover and is about to announce her intention to live together. She is only twenty-one years old, and her origin is probably in the Jiahu area. Regarding this secret act of hers, we can only say: "In ancient times, there was Hua Mulan; today, there is Wang Kangfu."</p>

<p>Recently, Mei Lanfang has been focusing on his artistry, and his skills have improved greatly over the past year. He continues to perform in Beiping as usual. There has been talk of him going south, but Mei has always declined. However, recently, Huang Jinrong, who is establishing a hospital, intends to invite him to Shanghai to help raise funds. Mei has expressed his willingness, believing that charitable work is urgently needed during this time of national crisis and that he should do his part. However, ordinary performances are not yet appropriate, so his plans are not yet fully decided, but people at sea are already eagerly inquiring.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Trendy Words <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— ·Xi</p>
<p>In every era, there are new trends, and in every era, there are trendy words. In China, during the late Qing Dynasty, speaking about foreign affairs was the trendiest thing to do in official circles, from discussing diplomacy and handling military uniforms to training troops and manufacturing weapons. The phrase "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application" became a common saying. Gradually, it changed to talking about constitutionalism and implementing new policies, from opening parliament and establishing schools to mining, developing industries, and building railways. The phrase "reform and innovation" was the unanimous slogan of the nation at the time. After the Republic of China, from revolution and republic to the Northern Expedition and unification, there were no particularly trendy words commonly used in official circles during the Northern Government era! It's not that there weren't any, such as the warlords' phrases "If others do not offend me, I will not offend others" and "demanding salaries" and "disaster officials," but these are not what I want to record. After the capital moved south, many new words that are newly popular in official circles have very special colors and must be recorded. For example: (1) Looking for a job is called seeking "work." The old phrase "Where are you congratulating yourself?" is now changed to "Where are you working?" (2) Losing a job, the new name is called "unemployment." (3) Supporting a superior is called "supporting." (4) Attacking a certain faction is called "overthrowing." (5) Promoting a certain matter is called "conducting." For example, when you see someone seeking a good position, you cannot say, "How is your lobbying going?" You must change it to "How is your conducting going?" (6) Asking someone to promote you is called "introducing" or "clearing the path." (7) Promoting a certain faction or praising someone is called "propagandizing." (8) Scolding someone's lackeys is called "tools." (9) Campaigning for election is called "running for election." (10) Presenting matters is called "reporting." Just writing roughly, there are already ten types. In addition, this new bureaucratic dictionary is inexhaustible and will be continued when I am in the mood another day.</p>

<p>|She Was Still Perplexed|</p>
<p>One day, at lunchtime after school, several companions taking the same streetcar were waiting for each other, waiting for everyone to leave together. Just as they reached the intersection of ×× Road, a streetcar flew past them.</p>
<p>"We missed it by a few steps, and now we have to wait another fifteen minutes. How annoying," A complained.</p>
<p>"I might as well go exchange two dimes for copper coins," B said, noticing that she didn't have any coins in her pocket.</p>
<p>"What should we do? I'm hungry," C said, pressing her hands against her stomach.</p>
<p>"Then let's go to that shop and eat steamed buns! We still have more than ten minutes to wait for the streetcar, so we'll have time!" B pointed to a steamed bun shop by the roadside, seeking the consent of A and C. Finally, the three of them, like hungry ghosts, walked into this rarely visited steamed bun shop. Two baskets of small steamed buns were served, and everyone grabbed them and started eating without thinking. After taking a bite, C discovered a red, blood-like color on the steamed bun and was so frightened that she dared not swallow it. A and B also paid attention to their own steamed buns, but there was nothing on theirs. C was even more angry, her almond eyes wide open, and she took the steamed bun to the shopkeeper to argue: "Look, how can you sell such dirty things?" The shopkeepers, caught off guard, didn't have any appropriate words to answer!</p>
<p>Just then, A and B were as happy as Columbus discovering the New World because they realized that C's red and greasy lips were the reason why the steamed bun was red. They winked at C, and a flush of red spread across C's cheeks. Thus, they left that steamed bun shop. |It's true: "There's nothing really wrong, but fools worry themselves."</p>

<p>— ·Seeking·Happiness·Studio·Owner</p>
<p>The phrase "lifelong happiness" seemed like a sharp arrow piercing Lu Boqin's heart. He suddenly felt a chill down his spine, shaking him awake from his dazed state. His mind immediately cleared, and he remembered the idea he had decided on last night, which was extremely correct and should not be shaken or changed by his current confusion. He quickly mustered his courage, put in some self-control, and poured out the sentences he had carefully prepared:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm afraid my answer today won't satisfy you."</p>
<p>Tong Yizhen's expression changed abruptly. He also hurriedly lowered his eyelids and said in one breath, "I have considered it very carefully. I really cannot agree with the kind of liberation you proposed. Because running away rashly together will definitely lead to unfortunate results in the future and leave endless regrets. Think about it! We are both very young and don't have much ability. Besides doing a small job at the post office here, I'm afraid I won't be able to find a comparable job elsewhere. The problem of our family life after we run away will trap us in a stalemate. I appreciate your heartfelt love, and I'm willing to sacrifice anything. But we should put your happiness first. That way won't make you happy in the future, and it will cause you endless pain and damage in spirit, body, and reputation. How can I risk doing it without considering it? Yizhen, I love you, so I can't hurt you. You should understand my good intentions."</p>
<p>Tong Yizhen couldn't bear to listen any longer. Tears welled up and covered her face, which was filled with disappointment, grief, and misery. Unexpectedly, she grabbed the umbrella, stood up, and left. Only with her back turned did she say such piercing words:</p>
<p>"I don't want to hear you talk. What do you mean by thinking about my happiness? Yet you're willing to let me be someone else's fifth concubine? Is that my great happiness? I understand. You don't have the revolutionary spirit of modern young people, you're afraid to take risks for love, and you can't bear to sacrifice that little rice bowl at the post office, so you can bear to ignore my affairs. You're too cowardly!"</p>
<p>Lu Boqin was so frightened that he hurriedly chased after her. She turned around and spat, saying, "It's not just cowardly, I'm going to call you despicable. I, Tong Yizhen, have been blind, recognizing the wrong person, and foolishly wanting to take you, a despicable thing, as a lover to rely on. Now I see you clearly. There's no need to talk anymore. From now on, no one cares about anyone, no one knows anyone anymore. Let's do our own things."</p>

<h3 id="e213">Saving the Nation Through the Buddhist Altar <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— ·佛</p>
<p>The Panchen Lama has already arrived in Beiping and will soon open the "Kalachakra Dharma Assembly to Pacify Disasters" in Beiping. That's great. Human power cannot save the nation, so we can only ask the bodhisattvas to save the nation.</p>
<p>Any politician, any military strategist, or any ideological system, once it comes to China, is always helpless. If it's not done well, "madness, tuberculosis, bloating, and obstruction," all four are incurable diseases. China's illness originally combines all four, so no matter how famous a doctor is invited to diagnose and prescribe medicine, it's mostly ineffective and can only await death. We must invite great immortals like Hua Tuo and Lu Chunyang to diagnose and treat it.</p>
<p>China is originally a country of many gods. Establishing teachings through divine ways is originally the first fundamental law of governing the country. Books like "The Investiture of the Gods" and "Journey to the West" are originally national treasures of our country. Jiang Ziya, Liu Bowen, Wang Chanlao, Bai Niangniang, Hongxian, and Nie Yinniang are originally representative figures in our country's history. Now that our country is plagued by internal and external troubles and is in a state of disarray, as long as one great immortal accidentally violates heavenly laws and is demoted to the mortal world, or their worldly karma is not yet exhausted and they fall into the mortal realm, then our country's savior will arrive.</p>
<p>The Buddha Dharma is boundless and its supernatural powers are vast. Sun Wukong somersaulted dozens of times, but he still couldn't escape the Buddha's five fingers. Since ancient times, the Xiongnu, Turks, Jurchens, Khitans, and various barbarians, no matter how fierce they were, once they came to China, they were completely assimilated. This is also a sign of the boundless Buddha Dharma. Although Japan is tyrannical and acts recklessly, it will definitely not escape the Tathagata's yin-yang calculations.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our country's authorities have wholeheartedly prayed day and night to the League of Nations Bodhisattva to save them from suffering and disaster. Now, the report equivalent to a divine oracle has already been issued. Although the League of Nations has not yet held a meeting to discuss it, and the outcome is still unclear, judging from this divine oracle, our country's illness has no hope of recovery. It can be seen that the League of Nations is ultimately human and not divine, and the Old Man of Heaven is not effective.</p>
<p>Now that the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly is being held, all the great bodhisattvas will surely descend, opening great wisdom and turning the great Dharma wheel, and will surely subdue all the goblins, demons, and monsters under the altar one by one. Since there is a disaster-pacifying altar with boundless Buddha Dharma and vast supernatural powers, there must be unexpected effectiveness. We should wait and see.</p>

<p>Who abandoned the land, causing me grief? There is no way to request an imperial decree to execute the wicked. The gradual encroachment and voracious annexation continue actively. The fox city and rat society are spreading rumors. The country lacks complete territory, thinking of the Yellow Emperor. The court has powerful favorites, crying for Yue Wang. Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Hui share the same pain. Last year today, Shenyang was lost.</p>
<p>Autumn rain and autumn wind darken the painting journey. The ancient Chinese country is a time of heartbreak. Internal strife is still fierce like tigers. Recapturing lost territory is too foolish to imagine. The key to the northern gate is futilely gazing north. The eastern province of the map belongs to the eastern barbarians. There are more scholars who engage in empty talk than carp. Who compares to Wang Qi, a favored concubine?</p>

<h3 id="e215">Method of Making Plaster Statues <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— ·枕</p>
<p>The method of making plaster statues uses the property of calcined gypsum to absorb water and combine. Ordinary crystalline gypsum contains two molecules of water of crystallization (CaSO5·2H2O). When calcined for a certain time, it loses one molecule of water of crystallization and becomes calcined gypsum (CaSO4H2O). After mixing with water, it dries into a white solid block in about fifteen minutes, which can be carved. Before making a plaster statue, a mold must be made first.</p>
<p>(1) Making the Mold. To make the mold, the original object (such as a doll if you want to make a mold of a doll) must first be coated with a semi-solid oil, such as petroleum jelly or thick soapy water. Knead clay into long strips, the height of which is equal to the thickness of the mold to be made. Then surround the clay strips around the side edge of the original object. Then mix gypsum with water to form a thick paste and fill in any side surrounded by the clay strips. After the gypsum is dry, remove the clay strips, and the gypsum will adhere to the original object. Pry it off by hand. At a certain distance from the edge of the gypsum, dig a small square notch. Coat the edge and the inside of the notch with oil. Fit it in the original place and mix gypsum again to fill the other side. The second piece of the mold is made with a protruding part that matches the small notch of the previous piece of the mold. After doing this, you can cast a plaster statue or a wax statue. The above is the simplest method for making a mold for casting a plaster statue. If the object has uneven concavity and convexity and is full of curves, it is not applicable. Therefore, the mold for making a plaster statue can have up to ten or more pieces. When making the statue, the molds must be joined together, tied tightly with ropes, and gypsum is poured in through a hole of appropriate size at the bottom of the mold. Ordinary molds for casting wax statues are only made of two pieces, and there is no need for a larger hole, only a hole that can accommodate a goose feather tube is enough.</p>
<p>(2) Making the Plaster Statue. Mix calcined gypsum into a thin paste and pour it in from the bottom of the mold. The amount depends on the size of the mold. After pouring, rotate the mold so that the inside of the mold is evenly covered with gypsum. It can solidify in two or three minutes. Then remove the mold. At this time, the plaster statue is complete, but there will be protruding lines at the joints of the mold, which can be removed with a knife. Then rub it with horsetail grass or fine sandpaper to complete it.</p>
<p>Over time, the plaster statue often becomes dull and unsightly. Never wipe it with wet objects. First wipe it with a dry cloth, and then rub it with horsetail grass to make it as white as new.</p>
<p>(3) Making the Wax Statue. Heat and melt the wax, dye it with various colors, and pour it into the lower part of the mold. Then cover the upper part of the mold, shake it quickly, insert a goose feather tube about an inch long into the small hole of the mold, blow it hard, and quickly put it into cold water. Separate the mold, and the wax statue will float to the surface of the water. Remove the seam lines of the mold, and correct the goose feather tube hole to complete a perfect wax statue.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Deliberations on the School Fee Issue <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— ·</p>
<p>Social construction is based on money, and education will eventually become commercialized! This kind of social pathology can only be blamed on the bad results that our government should have. If the government's method of running education does not violate the principles of socialism, then a portion of the taxes paid by the people is enough to provide beautiful educational institutions and educational administration. People of the appropriate age have the right to receive education, and the government is always responsible for "teaching" and "raising." Then, the problem of paying fees will naturally disappear, only because the government runs education only with nominal but not real intentions, inappropriately distributes the taxes of the poor and common people, resulting in professors demanding salaries, students going on strike, principals embezzling public funds, and political tides manipulating students, and many other malpractices are countless. National education cannot satisfy the people, so the establishment of private educational institutions follows, and then the problem of paying fees arises and the situation of entanglement is discovered.</p>
<p>Committing private fraud is due to the long-term historical changes of China and the relationship of vast areas, and the bad national character that has become deeply ingrained by the people's accumulated habits and following the old ways. The money earned by the people's blood and sweat passes through the hands of politicians, and big money turns into small money, and small money turns into no money. As a result, those who run education become even more aggravated and openly operate a business. How can this kind of atmosphere allow the poor to rise above, and how can China become rich and strong? The discussion in this article does not focus on the issue of whether or not various fees should be paid or the amount of payment, because those who use public office for private gain will never defraud "without a legitimate reason." What we pay attention to is the use of the fees after they are paid. What we want to prevent is private fraud after the fees are paid. Now, let's say the most important methods for everyone to comment on.</p>
<p>(1) Open School Finances. School finances must not only be cleared by accountants, but also an organized mixed supervisory committee must be formed. The candidates will be represented by the Social Affairs Bureau, student parents, school directors, and famous people from the society. The powers of the supervisory committee are to review the budget, audit finances, and report those who commit private fraud. Then, the school's finances have been supervised by the whole society, and the habit of indiscriminate spending can be eliminated.</p>
<p>(2) The use of money from school income should be based on the principle of consumer cooperation, and it must never be profited from. If the economy is not sufficient, why not reduce the scope, strive for practicality, and not be greedy for false fame. For example, meal expenses, book sales, accommodation expenses, libraries, experiment expenses, and sports expenses should have student representatives participating in cooperation and monitoring at the same time. Their obligation is to publicize the situation at any time. Students above high school should select representatives, while in primary and secondary schools, the school authorities will report to the school supervisory committee every month and the school supervisory committee will send staff to investigate openly and secretly at any time.</p>
<p>(3) The standard of fees for major primary and secondary schools should first be researched and stipulated by education experts, with the aim of popularizing education. Later, each school can slightly change it according to the location. National schools have monthly government subsidies,</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Therefore, the burden on students is naturally reduced, and the burden on private schools is relatively heavier, but it is fortunate that the money spent does not go into the private pockets of a few people. As for enjoying the government's right to "teach" and "raise," our common people can only pray and hope.</p>
<p>In short, education expenses have a civilian standard, the principle of usage is based on consumer cooperation, and when expenses are used, they are supervised by the whole society, and the problem of paying fees will naturally be solved, and profit-making educational institutions will also be eliminated. There is no need for us to be verbose.</p>

<p>Whose Fault Is It?</p>
<p>— ·洪·水</p>
<p>Once, when I was sick, I lay for a whole night and half a day in a pavilion where no sunlight came in. The heavy air was really unbearable. The eldest son of the second landlord was enthusiastically humming Peking opera tunes in the hall. At that time, my head almost hurt so badly that it was about to burst open, so I had to go out on the street for a walk. I happened to wander into a construction site where houses were being built. Everything seemed ordinary, except for a short, lively young worker, estimated to be only thirteen or fourteen years old, but with two heavy buckets of mud on his slanted and narrow shoulders, which attracted my great attention! "Child, how's the work going?" I asked him kindly with a smile.</p>
<p>"! Not bad, sir!"</p>
<p>"What's your name? You're probably thirteen or fourteen years old, right?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm already sixteen years old. Sir, my name is A'gen, and my surname is Wang."</p>
<p>"Ah! A'gen, you look very young, you don't look like you're sixteen or seventeen years old."</p>
<p>"I can't be compared to ordinary people, because most people's living environment is beautiful and pleasant, they eat well, wear well, and their bodies naturally develop faster. Like me, I was born with a hard life. Since I was young, I couldn't talk about nutrition and protection, and I also had to do hard labor. Naturally, my development couldn't be healthy, and I grew up with such a short stature. It's really 'Eating a lot doesn't make me big.' Haha! Sir, please don't laugh at me. I'm a child who doesn't lie!" At the same time, he put down the two buckets of mud he was carrying and held the carrying pole straight, as if waiting for me to respond.</p>
<p>"What do your parents do?"</p>
<p>"Alas! My dad was also a mason. Unfortunately, he accidentally fell from the fifth floor while building a house for Master Shen two years ago, and his brains splattered everywhere, and he died instantly. My mom does mending work for a living. There, she's mending clothes for the workers over there!" A'gen pointed to a woman sitting on a small stool under the shade of a tree across the street, tirelessly wielding a needle. The woman was holding a baby with a big head and a thin neck, who was crying softly, sucking on her nipple. A'gen then said softly, "The baby my mom is holding is my little brother. He's a posthumous child. He's also often sick and cries a lot. How would he know that he lost his father before he was even born, a poor orphan!"</p>
<p>"Oh! That's so pitiful! How was your father's funeral handled?"</p>
<p>"Sir, speaking of this, it must be said that my dad was a good person when he was alive, so his workers, who are also my foremen, tried their best to ask Master Shen for help. They finally got 150 old silver dollars to settle the matter. My foreman also took pity on our widow and orphans, and treated me as a senior worker. Although the work is a bit too much for me to handle, I grit my teeth and try hard to struggle, and I don't feel much of anything."</p>
<p>"How much do you get paid a day?"</p>
<p>"Four dimes, the meals are paid for by the company, and the side dishes are paid for by myself. This is considered a senior worker!"</p>
<p>"Wow! So senior workers only get four dimes."</p>
<p>"Sir, look, the junior workers who are hammering stones and sifting soil all day long, or carrying heavy objects, shout 'Hang Yu' 'Hang Yu' all night long, and each person only gets two dimes." He pointed to a group of people who were doing heavy work, shouting back and forth. At the same time, a kind of smile of "more than enough compared to those below" and "sufficient to comfort myself" seemed to float on his face. "Labor is sacred, that's not wrong. A'gen, I envy you very much. At such a young age, you can support yourself. I also want to come and work. Can you find a senior worker position for me?"</p>
<p>"Haha! How can you compare to us poor people? We should be the ones building houses. Building this one and building that one, but we suffer until we're old and still don't have a house to live in. Sir, instead of taking pity on us, you still want to make fun of us?"</p>
<p>A'gen carried the buckets of mud and flew up the steps to the roof. Although I couldn't continue talking to him, it raised a question: those who build houses are one group of people, and those who live in houses are another group of people. What the child said makes some sense, but what is the fault for society creating such unfair things?</p>

<h3 id="e217">Request for Early Departure Due to Important Matters <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— ·Shen· Xiu</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, during the third period, while the class was studying official document formats, less than thirty minutes in, several students suddenly began to snicker. Oh? It turned out that a female student sitting near the classroom door had packed up her books and left without saying goodbye to the teacher.</p>
<p>Leaving during class time without informing the teacher is usually a common occurrence, but with female students, it cannot be viewed the same as male students. It seems worthy of our attention. In less than a minute, another female student left in the same manner. What was the reason for this? Many male students naturally did not understand and snickered even more loudly than the first. The snickering had not yet stopped when a third female student left through the doorway. At that point, the male students' mood gradually became agitated, and they snickered in unison, scaring the female student into practically running away.</p>
<p>Three female students left in a row. The teacher, because of his special consideration for female students, did not pursue the matter. Especially our official document format teacher, who was so amiable, didn't interfere with them. Therefore, the male students' snickering was naturally not prohibited either.</p>
<p>There were still two female students sitting further inside, who, when leaving, would naturally have to pass in front of the teacher. Passing in front of the teacher without informing him made them feel a little embarrassed, and the male students' snickering added to the difficulty. Asking was difficult for the female students who were prone to shyness, truly a dilemma. However, watching the three female students leave, already three or four minutes had passed. These two female students seemed to show signs of anxiety. They had no choice but to write a note, which they passed to the teacher. The teacher took it and nodded slightly. The two female students then left, looking both shy and pleased, with their heads bowed. Oh! The slight nod, it turned out, indicated permission for them to leave. As they left, the male students, as before, sent a few snickers!</p>
<p>Now that the female students had completely left, many male students rushed to see the note that the female students had passed to the official document format teacher, craning their necks, asking each other, causing a disruption. The teacher, catering to the majority of the students' wishes, dismissed the class.</p>
<p>Look! Look! A burst of shouts. What did the female students write? Very simply, it was written, "Request for early departure due to important matters," six characters. These six characters became the topic of conversation and speculation for the male students that evening.</p>

<p>The other day, I passed by the North Railway Station and saw a shop assistant at a cigarette and paper shop arguing with a man in a Western suit about exchanging small change. I felt that this matter was detrimental to the character of merchants and also an undesirable state of society. Therefore, I am writing it down below.</p>
<p>"Many shops exchange two dimes for five hundred cash, why do you only exchange it for four hundred and eighty cash here?" the man in the Western suit questioned the shop assistant.</p>
<p>"This is the railway station, it cannot be compared to other places!" the shop assistant replied with a stern face.</p>
<p>"Then why don't you put up a sign? Clearly stating that two dimes are exchanged for four hundred and eighty cash!" the man in the Western suit continued to question.</p>
<p>"Just be easygoing, give him one more copper coin!" another shop assistant said.</p>
<p>"No way! Isn't there a cigarette and paper shop across the street that is hanging a sign saying that two dimes are exchanged for five hundred cash?" the man in the Western suit retorted, pointing to a cigarette and paper shop across the street.</p>
<p>"Just give him back the small change!" another shop assistant said again.</p>
<p>The man in the Western suit saw how arrogant the shop assistant was! Naturally, his anger flared up, and he cursed loudly, "Scoundrel! Come out here!"</p>
<p>Fortunately, others came to mediate, and a storm was averted. After the man in the Western suit left, the shop assistant grumbled, "Miser! Dressed in a nice Western suit, trying to haggle over one or two copper coins to death, really a miser..."</p>
<p>Almost everyone in Shanghai has encountered the above situation. Alas! Not at all different from "merchants love wealth" and "lost integrity". However, nowadays everyone, especially important people, has the despicable traits of merchants, relying solely on deceptive tactics to make a living!</p>
<p>Finally, I want to tell everyone, never exchange foreign currency or small change at places like tram stations and railway stations, because the general cigarette and paper shops here all employ greedy tactics of hoarding!</p>
