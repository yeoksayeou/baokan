<h3 id="c1">牛蘭案平議翰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>牛蘭夫婦以有危害民國嫌疑。於去年六月十五日被逮於上海。迄今已逾一年。而猶以管轄問題糾纒不淸。使當事人長期拘留。雖在形體上未遭縲絏之苦。在精神上已無異受囹圄之禁。此則司法手續之迂緩。誠無可諱言也。</p>
<p>惟牛蘭夫婦。近以憂憤絶食。至於十五日之久。一方要求移轉管轄。并准聘外籍律師出庭辯護。夫以法律之要求。而出以絶食之方式。則未免失之太愚。蓋移轉管轄。儘可作合法之聲請。固不必出諸絶食。而外籍律師出庭。以格於現法。雖絶食亦難通融。今要人學者旣以人道主義之立塲。具保牛蘭夫婦出院療養。則此絶食問題。已可告一叚落。然於案之本身。猶漠不相關也。</p>
<p>夫此問題在目前爭執之重心爲管轄問題。即訴訟之形式問題。而非訴訟之實體問題。故牛蘭案之管轄問題。雖能一旦解决。而牛蘭案之本身。固不能連帶同時解决也。彼營救牛蘭夫婦者。激於一時熱烈之感情。一則曰要求移滬審理。再則曰要求釋放。初不知移滬與釋放實爲兩事。固不能同時要求。移滬爲管轄問題。自可由當事人直接聲請。釋放則須以審判爲前提有罪應究無罪應釋在法律之前。人人平等。固不能因牛蘭夫婦爲外人。或爲「世界學者所關心之人。」而得享有特别優越之待遇。亦不能因營救者爲世界學者或黨國名人。而可以通融辦理。司法羅鄭兩長之辭職。要亦具有維持法律之苦心。固不媓能加以非議者也。</p>
<p>按牛蘭案之管轄問題。遷延至今。未得解决。其最大原因有二。吾國司法制度之獨立精神。根本未嘗卓立。一也。當事人在訴訟之手續上。不能明白而多錯亂。二也。牛蘭夫婦逮捕以後。初由江蘇高等法院第二分院訊問。繼由淞滬警備司令部提取押解軍政部。繼復以此案之犯罪地點。不在戒嚴區域之内。故依危害民國緊急治罪法第七條規定。軍事機關無權管轄。乃將被告等解送司法行政部。改由江蘇高等法院管轄。故就過去經過之事實而觀。若無軍事機關之牽涉。則管轄問題。根本不致發生。今因此一牽涉。轉輾遷延。而遂造成絶大之曲折。則司法制度未克卓然獨立。有以致之也。至當事人對於移轉管轄。往往向司法行政部請求。殊不知行政不能干涉司法。此種不循法定手續之聲請。自難發生效力。於是牛蘭案之管轄問題。就受一大頓。挫繼以刑訴法第二十二條之解釋錯誤。致對於移轉管轄之聲請。被江蘇高等法院所駁斥。於是牛蘭案之管轄問題。復受一頓挫。今牛蘭夫婦之辯護。士旣正式向最高法院作合法之聲請。則管轄問題已有澈底解决之望。若當事人在手續上未鑄錯誤。則此軒然大波之管轄問題。亦早得解决之途徑矣。</p>
<p>今牛蘭夫婦。旣得保出就醫。移轉管轄問題。亦已作合法聲請。深望最高法院早日裁决。務使牛蘭案之審判。得早日從形式而達於實體。斯案關繫國際上之觀瞻甚鉅。法官之審判。自有法律與事實爲權衡。固不必因外界之紛擾而有所顧慮。至政府權衡國家利害。而欲有所救濟。亦未始無法可以運用。此則羅法長已經明言者也。</p>

<p>自由談	二一　譚破棉襖變了蝨棉襖  廬　　今年，望到明年好；明年，望到後年好，到了後年，依舊着一件破棉襖！這是，小朋友們坐在小竹椅上乘凉時所唱的山歌。我聽了，便發生着感想：　　吾國的現狀，大概也是這般吧！經一次政變，民衆便抱着一種希望；以爲，一步步的可以交着幸運。該穿破棉襖的，要穿新棉襖以；穿了新棉襖以後，要穿絲棉襖了。誰料，都成了夢想！誰料，應了小朋友的山歌依舊着一件破棉襖！　　閱報，見外國人對於中華，有一種冷的比評。略云··在數十年前，中日兩國的船隻，同樣蹩脚；但是，到了現在，日人的航業，一躍千丈，得到非常的進步；中國却依舊行駛這幾雙隻破船。這般的論調，也似小朋友所唱的依舊着一件破棉襖！　　依舊着一件破棉襖，雖没有進步，也没有退步，還算是保持現狀呢。若把吾國的情形，澈底的觀察一下，不見得依舊着一件破棉襖吧！從前，還可以保守這破碎河山；到了現在，河山依舊是破碎，但是，盤踞着許多日宼，僞國軍，和横衝，直撞，東竄，西突的共產黨！唉！這不是一件破棉襖了！這是一件蝨棉襖了！　　小朋友，你們的山歌，我來删改一下子··　　今年穿了破棉襖，　　明年想穿新棉襖，　　後年想穿絲棉襖，　　到了後年不好了！　　破棉襖變了蝨棉襖！値得介紹的國貨工廠（五）  何躬行　　（七）鈕扣工廠　　鈕扣原料爲蚌殼牛羊骨角等物。而蚌殼製之貝鈕。用途尤廣。上海自中華職業學校開設鈕扣科後。一時陸家浜小西門一帶。製造貝扣者。不計數。五六年來。相繼失敗。迄今上海全市。除齊物浦路之中國鈕扣廠。徽寗路之自求貝扣廠外。已不多見矣。查日貨鈕扣。價格低廉。礙難與之競賣。而外埠國人。若浙江沿海等區。又各廠肆林立。上海房租及工料較貴。成本已大。營業難以振興。於是上海之鈕扣業。遂宣告失敗矣。　　蚌殼以來自浙江定海爲大宗。每擔價洋二元餘。用螺司撞床。將蚌殼一一照鈕扣大小之圓形。儘量撞下。用小車床。車成邊心。鑽孔。擇厚薄相同者。分别訂入紙板上。每板通行三十枚。買以籮計。卽一百四十板。價格不一。自十元至二十元不等。骨角製者較貴。上項工作機器。通稱鈕扣機。每具約洋四十元左右。此機機身極小可安置作台上或用手搖。或用發動機拖帶。　　查海關貿易册載。日貨鈕扣進口價値。民國十七年。計八○三·二五三兩。十八年。計六三三·○六五兩。十九年。計五九八·四五一兩。三年比較之。居然逐年減少。　　（八）擦銅油工廠　　近年市塲上。銅闌干銅招牌盛行。而擦銅油一物。亦銷用大廣。所見　球牌。鐵錨牌。　光牌籃鐘牌等擦銅油。均係外貨。　　上海康腦脫路中一化工廠。出有八卦牌擦銅油。行銷已七八年。去年銷售至一千餘箱。箱裝三打。市價每箱洋七元上下。價廉物亦不惡。惜少宣傳。故國人知者尚少。　　查擦銅油製造。須無酸無鹼。不損五金。無臭氣。無變化。者爲上品。其原料以戤司林甘油白石粉等調之。裝入五金盒中卽成。李瑛  顧明道　　淞滬之役。日人以爲我國始終抱不抵抗主義也。突然發難。故有四小時佔領閘北之豪語。不料我忠勇之十九路軍不畏强暴。誓死抵抗。日人迭受重創。數易司令。血戰逾月。大有　山易　岳家軍難之情景。第五軍繼之。廟行一戰。犠牲雖鉅。而敵人之死傷竟有數千之多。可使日軍知秦非無人矣。其間義勇軍激於愛國熱忱。亦多執殳甘爲前驅者。馮大學生軍天津骷髏團中。且有女子從戎。同心殺賊。足與古時若木蘭沈雲英輩輝映先後也。李瑛者。太倉人。讀於滬之某女校。剛健婀娜。兼而有之。爲松江籃球隊中之健將。固一英雌也。自聞滬戰。即欲投軍。爲國宣力。彼時適放寒假。與其父母家居。即以其志告於父母。冀得同情。父母恐其有危險也。不許。瑛大憤。思乘間脫身而去。顧二豎來侵。病弗能興。日讀報紙。探問前敵消息。見我軍捷報。則欣然喜。大呼努力殺賊。及瀏河失守。十九路軍退守第二防線時。瑛大哭。謂血戰月餘之功。廢於一旦。此誰之咎歟。時太倉亦岌岌可危。敵前鋒將至。其父母遂挈之走蘇。休養多日。病遂霍然。一日忽告失踪。留書雙親。大意謂以身許國。願戮力殺賊。寗爲沙塲鬼。不作亡國奴。男女同是國民。理當執干戈以保我疆土。兒行矣。毌以兒爲念。瑛父母得書驚惶。遣急足四出訪尋。　無下落。越數日。瑛忽翩然歸來。其容　然。細詢之。始知瑛曾隻身走崑山。至軍中投效。適其時停戰條約將簽字。前線無戰事。馮大義軍亦已遣歸。故不錄。瑛不得已懊喪而回。然其志亦彌可敬矣。政海雋屑  濟翔　　昔年有某縣長。在任時携其兩公子與俱。幼者年方十二三。頗伶俐善談說。一日。有電話至。署役進報曰。「老爺。某處有電話來」。時公子亦在旁。迨縣長出室外。即語署役曰。「今日不宜更呼老爺矣。老爺究値幾錢一斤耶。後勿再稱之」署役唯唯。退而語人。以爲怪事。　　寳山袁俶　先生。爲已故大敎育家袁觀瀾先生介弟。夙以敢言聞於時。故有機關槍之雅號。　年滬上倡議醵資爲齊爕元鑄鐵象。以彰其禍蘇之罪。先生實董其事。一時輿論歸之。國府定都南京。先生牛刀小試。出爲啓東首任縣長。醞釀十餘年之分縣問題。至先生乃獲告成。蓋彼時蘇省主席鈕惕生氏。亦逆知此事非卓厲如先生。不克任其勞怨也。旋復移宰太倉。在官前後凡兩載有餘。淸聲震遠近。人民耳目。爲之一新。當其解組太倉。以署後新植梅花百本。未見長成。忽遂言别。意不能忘。乃爲詩兩首。以遺後任。中有句云。「百本梅花隨點付。鎭洋山色可長春」。相託維護之情。殷殷言外。而餘事概不及焉。其風趣有如此。　　繼袁而官太倉者。爲南昌陶小柳先生。陶固風雅士也。舊爲南社中人。葉楚傖曾從而問業焉。所作詩淸新滿洒。頗足成家。在任時。惟好吟咏。嘗語人曰。我不善作官。故纔及四月。即掛冠去。去之日。爲詩留别。一時和者紛至。先生遂彙而付之梨棗。顔曰。一　江釃唱集」以分酬諸投贈者焉。逃犯口中之匪軍  石子　　舊雨李君。　者讀於武漢。旣卒所業·悵惘無之。飄泊夏楚三載。衣食無所繼。客秋。邂逅一父執。憫其困頓。誘之入共。蓋李君之父執。供職於赤軍之某政治部也。李閱世未深。竟爲所惑。隨輾轉八月。歷湘鄂豫皖。出死入生。飽受人間痛苦。迄今春。赤軍受重創於皖西。糧盡援絶。勢將解體。李乃狼狽北遁。步行八十餘里始得脫險。倉皇來滬。述在匪軍中之見聞。亟筆述之。　　李君言。匪軍中頗有學識湛深之軍事學家。厠身其間。舉凡一切行軍防禦。攻城進退等事。胥由此輩主持之。而其軍令之嚴。遠勝於官兵。例如匪隊之開拔。則令到二小時。即可諸事辦妥而成行。小隊之行動。更見迅捷。而尤以友軍被困。派隊往援時爲甚。往往以十小時行山地百里以上。下級軍官。頗多以女子充任。此輩女子。服御與男子同。而執法頗嚴。行軍時。荷槍爲導。作戰時。身先士卒。得前進令。勇往直前遇敵。則肉搏而戰。雖負重傷。罔有後退。必所斬將搴旗而後已。否則寗願死於軍前。其勇悍兇驇。　非疲敝之剿匪軍。所可望其項背。匪軍之得以飛揚跋扈致成今日燎原之勢者。固亦有由來也。　　匪軍藥彈。本極匱乏。而購置又復不易。乃極力拉攏各地雜色軍隊。迨軍隊旣被誘入彀。則伺隙解散之。而没收其械彈。資爲已用。然得之不易。且所得無多。遇大股勦匪軍。終難爲敵。故其巢窟。往往營於山林菁密之區。軍隊來攻。則馮險以守。攻勦稍懈。則復恣肆横行。當其奪得一地也。必屠殺大户。而以其土地廬舍。分給當地游民痞棍。爲市惠之計。所有現銀糧食。則悉嚢括以去。於是游民痞棍。爲虎作倀。暢所欲爲。一旦軍隊蒞止。匪軍自審不敵。則傾巢而去。游民痞棍。失所憑藉。知無以立足。乃火其居。而亦流落爲匪矣。於是匪愈剿而愈多。而匪勢日益滋蔓難圖矣。夫妻之遷調  鴻賓　　天津附近之某村。有王姓者。家道小康。弟兄四人。曰伯·仲·叔·季·已先後結婚。而俱無子女。昆仲旣素稱和睦。妯娌又異常相得。融融洽洽。極家庭之樂事。　　不幸伯之婦忽染急症而亡。闔家方在悲悼之際。而季又逝世。以環境論。伯固必須續娶。但擇婦惟恐不賢。季婦亦必須改嫁。而適人惟恐不淑。且相處旣久。一旦分離。均未免戀戀。再四思維。實無十全之策。不得已。仲婦乃倡以季婦配大伯。旣可免分離之苦。又無續娶不賢之患。雖然。伯季年齡。相去甚遠。老夫少妻。殊屬不稱。季婦又恐以弟婦嫁大伯。其名不雅。致貽笑柄。此議乃不果行。因循旣久。終非良策。叔之婦忽異想天開。倡議各移其位。即以仲婦改配伯。叔婦改配仲。而以季婦改配叔。如此年旣相若。而分離及不睦等等。自可無慮矣。三婦議旣定。乃各商於其夫。均以爲捨此而外。實無良策。遂一致通過。而在無條條無儀式之下。實行改配矣。　　夫以弟兄四人。而各配異姓之婦。竟能融洽如是。一奇也。事出之巧。又幸各無子女。二奇也。倡此議者。爲一婦人。且爲一有愛夫之婦人。三奇也。倡而即和。各無異詞。四奇也。但對於法律。道德。以及人情。風俗。其合耶否耶。請質諸賢者。失學兼失業  不平　　暑期到了，大批的畢業生挾着文，憑，在烈日炎威之下，趾高氣揚的從學校裏出來，升學者升學，謀事者謀事，各向各的道路去走。家境富裕的子弟們，固不難由小學而中學，而大學，而留學，養成博學之士，回來若無高就，儘可高枕無憂，坐着大吃其家鄕白米飯；因爲少爺有的是錢啊！　　若說謀職業的呢，祗須脚力大，門路多，交遊廣，自然席豐履厚的位，恭候着你蒞任。然而一般窮小子們，祇因向學之心有，經濟之力無，眼巴巴地望着人家從侯門如海高門檻的貴族學校裏進去，而窮小子們，旣無力升學，那只有自嘆命薄而失學了！　　失學後，只有找事做了，然旣無門路，又無勢力，更無所謂交際了。祇爲環境所迫，不得不東奔西跑，託人找事，送禮啊，說情啊，以謀一枝之棲，但是好像「羊肉包子打狗，有去無回，」終是失望而已。你若是催得急了，他便瞪着白眼，冷冷地說：「我們公司正在裁員减薪呢。」即使有了一個小小的位置，可怕的保證金，亦得把窮小子聞而退却。　　這樣使你排徊於迷茫之路，旣不能升學，又不能就業，那麽只有「失業兼失學。」這苦衷，應向誰去訴說呢？藝林近訊（一）棋盤街中五馬路合衆商場舉行之合衆書畫展覽會。已於十六日開　。三樓四樓羅列海上名家書畫。四壁琳　。美不勝收。（二）上海美術專校十七日起。。舉行第三十九届師生作品展覽會三天。陳列作品千餘點。均爲師生得意之作。觀者　往。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Deliberations on the Noulens Case <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Noulens were arrested in Shanghai on June 15th of last year on suspicion of endangering the Republic of China. More than a year has passed, and the issue of jurisdiction remains tangled and unclear, causing the individuals involved to be detained for an extended period. Although they have not suffered physical imprisonment, they have been subjected to spiritual confinement. The slow pace of judicial procedures is undeniable.</p>
<p>However, Mr. and Mrs. Noulens recently went on a hunger strike due to worry and indignation, which lasted for fifteen days. On the one hand, they requested a transfer of jurisdiction and permission to hire foreign lawyers to appear in court to defend them. To make legal requests through a hunger strike is rather foolish. The transfer of jurisdiction could be requested legally without resorting to a hunger strike. The appearance of foreign lawyers is restricted by current law and cannot be accommodated even through a hunger strike. Now that influential figures and scholars, from a humanitarian standpoint, have guaranteed the release of Mr. and Mrs. Noulens for medical treatment, this hunger strike issue has come to a temporary end. However, the case itself remains unrelated.</p>
<p>The current focus of the dispute is the issue of jurisdiction, which is a matter of legal procedure rather than the substance of the litigation. Therefore, even if the jurisdiction issue in the Noulens case is resolved, the case itself will not be resolved simultaneously. Those rescuing Mr. and Mrs. Noulens are driven by intense emotion. One demand is to move the trial to Shanghai, and another is to demand their release. They do not realize that moving the trial and releasing them are two separate matters and cannot be demanded at the same time. Moving the trial is a matter of jurisdiction, which can be requested directly by the parties involved. Release requires a trial as a prerequisite: the guilty should be prosecuted, and the innocent should be released. Everyone is equal before the law. Mr. and Mrs. Noulens should not be granted special preferential treatment because they are foreigners or "people concerned by world scholars." Nor can concessions be made because the rescuers are world scholars or famous figures in the Party and the nation. The resignations of the two judicial chiefs, Luo and Zheng, reflect their dedication to upholding the law and should not be criticized.</p>
<p>The delay in resolving the jurisdiction issue in the Noulens case is mainly due to two reasons. First, the independent spirit of our country's judicial system has not been firmly established. Second, the parties involved have been unclear and confused about the litigation procedures. After Mr. and Mrs. Noulens were arrested, they were initially interrogated by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Then, the Shanghai Garrison Command extracted and escorted them to the Ministry of Military Affairs. Later, because the crime site was not within a martial law zone, the case was referred to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for jurisdiction by the Jiangsu High Court, in accordance with Article 7 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Endangering the Republic of China, since the military authorities had no jurisdiction. Therefore, judging from the past facts, the jurisdictional issues would never have arisen if the military authorities had not been involved. Now, due to this involvement, the case has been repeatedly delayed, causing great complications, which is attributable to the failure to establish the judicial system's independence. As for the parties' requests for transfer of jurisdiction, they were often directed to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. However, administrative bodies cannot interfere with the judiciary. Such requests, which do not follow legal procedures, are naturally ineffective. As a result, the jurisdictional issue in the Noulens case suffered a major setback. Furthermore, due to misinterpretation of Article 22 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the Jiangsu High Court rejected the request for transfer of jurisdiction, resulting in another setback for the Noulens case. Now that the defense lawyers of Mr. and Mrs. Noulens have formally made a legal request to the Supreme Court, there is hope for a thorough resolution of the jurisdiction issue. If the parties had not made errors in the procedures, the path to resolving this high-profile jurisdictional issue would have been found earlier.</p>
<p>Now that Mr. and Mrs. Noulens have been released for medical treatment and a legal request for transfer of jurisdiction has been made, it is hoped that the Supreme Court will make a decision as soon as possible, so that the trial of the Noulens case can move from procedural to substantive matters as soon as possible. This case is of great international importance. Judges' trials should be based on law and facts, and they should not be concerned by external disturbances. As for the government, if it wants to provide relief while weighing national interests, there is still a way to use the law, as Chief Justice Luo has already stated clearly.</p>

They have gathered over a thousand militiamen and are preparing to fight Zhang to the death. Unexpectedly, the plan was leaked, and Zhang's troops surrounded them, burning civilian houses.

As today's Congress was in session, veteran representatives, aware of the imminent adjournment, again gathered 15,000 people on the Capitol lawn to petition, chanting slogans and demanding that Congress resolve to immediately provide cash loans for the remaining $2.24 billion in veterans' bonus certificates for relief.

The veteran representatives resisted the order. The police were then summoned to drive them away and arrest their leader, Waters. However, the veterans remained steadfastly unwilling to disperse. They dispatched a representative, Everett, to the White House to petition the President, but the President refused to see him. Upon hearing this news, over a hundred veterans went to demonstrate in front of the White House but were dispersed by the police.

The welcomers madly shouted "No surrender! Long live de Valera!" Most of the cabinet members were at the port to greet him. After disembarking, Mr. de Valera refused to make any statements to reporters and immediately drove back to his office to report the results of the London negotiations to government officials. Before boarding the ship in Holyhead to return to Ireland, Mr. de Valera had a telephone conversation with London, reportedly with British financial authorities, to discuss the issuance of a public statement. According to opinions in Irish political circles, it is still uncertain when the Anglo-Irish negotiations will resume.</p>
<p>London Dispatch from Havas on the 16th: After de Valera met with the British Prime Minister in London, someone asked Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald for his opinion on the failure of the recent Anglo-Irish negotiations. Mr. MacDonald replied that he believed the failure of these negotiations constituted a blemish on civilization. Mr. MacDonald also said, "I very much hope that the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury can, in the name of the Church, mediate between the British and Irish governments, so that they can implement the spirit of forgiveness preached by the founder of Christianity in resolving this dispute."</p>

The Free State government then raised various difficulties regarding how the arbitration tribunal should be organized. Although they were unwilling to engage in close negotiations with London on this matter, they ultimately proposed to the British government that the Free State government and the British government each appoint two commissioners to jointly investigate the facts. However, they did not mention that both sides should abide by the decisions of the commission, only stating that the two governments should engage in negotiations when the four commissioners draft a report. No method was proposed to reach a compromise agreement if negotiations failed. The British government now proposes: (1)</p>

<p>Since this dispute involves money, it should be adjudicated by a court. Before a ruling is made, land annuities should continue to be paid as usual. (2) Once the terms for arbitration or continued negotiations and the method of payment have been agreed upon, all current actions, including the imposition of special tariffs, will be suspended. The British government intends to negotiate this agreement as soon as it receives a reply from the Irish Free State in order to end the dispute.</p>

Therefore, Herriot's finance minister submitted a bill to the National Assembly stipulating a reduction in expenditures of 2.5 billion francs and an increase in taxes, which was expected to increase revenue by 1.5 billion francs. It was estimated that there would still be a shortfall of 1 billion francs, so it was necessary to issue new bonds to make up the difference. The largest reduction in French expenditures was in military spending, with a total reduction of 1.5 billion francs from the army, navy, and air force budgets. As for civil servants, salaries were reduced across the board, starting from the President and cabinet ministers.</p>
<p>U.S. Trade Deficit Last Month</p>
<p>Cash Continues to Flow Out</p>
<p>Washington Dispatch from Reuters on the 16th: The U.S. Department of Commerce released a trade report stating that U.S. imports exceeded exports in June, marking the first trade deficit this year. In June, U.S. imports were valued at $121 million, while exports were valued at $115 million.

<p>Important News</p>
<p>Far East War Can Resolve World Panic</p>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that when former Ambassador to France, Yoshizawa, returned to his country, a high-ranking official of a French arms company, named Roche, went to the Paris train station to see him off and discussed the supply of military supplies for the Far East war. Since the European war, most of the arms manufacturing factories in Europe and the United States have been shut down. Now, in view of the changing situation in the Far East, all famous arms factories and chemical companies in Europe are busy rushing to manufacture weapons in preparation for supplying the war in the East. On one hand, they are newly hiring laborers and renewing the organization of factories, and some factories even openly hoist the banner of "Manufacturing for the Far East War" high above their chimneys, fluttering in the sky. It is reported that France has already imported 800 million francs of military supplies to Japan, and this amount is still on the books. They are all products of the French Schneider arms factory. Other countries such as Germany and the United States have also exported large quantities of arms to the East, so the stock prices of military equipment in various countries are gradually rising. It can be said to be prosperity in the midst of depression. Moreover, in terms of the intentions of various countries, they also very much hope for the outbreak of the Far East war. Many of their arguments say that "war can resolve world panic," for example: (1) The German Mining News argues that the outbreak of war will inevitably affect the prices of military industry and various mineral products. According to reports in Paris, the Far East war seems to have a positive impact on opening up the world panic. (2) Norway's Oslo Morning Post claims that the Far East war is difficult to avoid. In other words, although war is a cruel act, in order to seek world prosperity, it is deeply hoped that this war will be created. After all, the demand for ships will inevitably increase with the outbreak of war, promoting speculation in rising prices. (3) Denmark's Financier Post claims that a single move in the Far East war can save the current panic and remove Denmark's exchange restriction order. If the war spreads to the entire Asian war, it can raise the standard of world prices, and world production can also recover from the dead end. Therefore, in order to get out of this deep depression, we have to expect this unexpected event. (4) American economic observer Babson said, "If Japan declares war on Russia, then we can expect the recovery of the world economic situation, and the killing tools stored by various countries due to the Far East war can be sold well, and a large number of unemployed people in various countries can also be hired to manufacture military supplies."</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Troops Engage the Enemy at Dahuangtai</p>
<p>The Two Armies Are Still Facing Each Other Between Bayan and Mulan</p>
<p>The Jilin Self-Defense Army Is Actively Moving Towards the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Xu Baozhen's brigade stationed in Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, was originally the guard regiment of the Heilongjiang Border Defense Commander's Office before the Nenjiang battle. In the battle of Tao'ang Road, Ma Zhanshan personally led this unit to annihilate Japanese soldiers in Daxing and Sanjianfang. The soldiers were loyal and brave, and were the crown of the Heilongjiang army. When Ma Zhanshan feigned surrender, he was incorporated into the 3rd Infantry Brigade and stationed in Nehe, serving as a shield for the Heihe area in advance. After Ma's departure, Xu was secretly instructed to wait for an opportunity to move. When the troops on the Huhu and Qike roads were fiercely fighting, Xu led his troops to respond, but before he could act, the Japanese Army's Amano Brigade was stationed in the county to monitor him. Therefore, Xu's brigade did not dare to move lightly. Recently, Ma led his troops to fight in the lower reaches of the Songhua River and in the eastern part of Heilongjiang. The Japanese army then concentrated on the Nenjiang-Qike road. The Koizumi Regiment of the Hiramatsu Brigade entered Nehe, intending to take the opportunity to resolve Xu's brigade. On July 8, Koizumi falsely claimed to hold a banquet, held a banquet in the Business Association, and invited Xu to drink. Xu had heard about it in advance, so on one hand, he excused himself due to illness, and on the other hand, he concentrated the main force of his troops that night, drove out of the city, and stationed his troops on the Gan River of Nehe. The cavalry company launched a fierce attack on the Japanese barracks at night. Because the Japanese army had already been prepared, they withdrew after a short battle. On the morning of the 9th, the two sides fought fiercely inside and outside the city. The Japanese army relied on the high and thick city walls, erected field artillery and fired, and the regimental commander Koizumi led cavalry and artillery soldiers out of the city, trying to cross the river and attack from both sides. Xu's brigade had already placed artillery in the area. When the Japanese army was halfway across the river, they opened fire and bombarded them, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers in the water. The remnants retreated to the city and held on, while sending a telegram to ask for help. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army brigade at the Ningnian station on the Qike road heard the news and rushed to help. That night, Xu's brigade met them on the river bank. The Japanese army had several times the advantage and pressed hard. Xu's brigade was unable to resist and retreated to the vicinity of Nenjiang, where they joined forces with Xu Zihe's cavalry and more than 4,000 militiamen who had just arrived from Heihe. Their momentum was huge. They had abandoned Nehe Nenjiang and advanced along the Qike road towards the capital of Heilongjiang Province. Most of the Japanese troops on the Qike line had been transferred back to Longsha and set up defenses in the four suburbs. Deng Wen's brigade of the Heilongjiang army, about 2,000 people, together with thousands of the Big Sword Society and Red Spear Society, began to attack Keshan from Baiquan on the 9th. The Japanese army, led by the main force of the Hiramatsu Brigade, guarded Keshan County and Longgou on the Qike road. The two armies opened fire at noon on the 9th. Deng's brigade mainly attacked the county seat, and the Red Spear Society and Big Sword Society attacked Longgou. In the evening, Deng's brigade, which attacked the city, had charged to Cuijia Inn, three miles away from the city. The Japanese army resisted desperately, relying on the sweeping power of their light and heavy machine guns. Deng's brigade had to retreat. After 7 p.m., they retreated to the northeast of Keshan. This force was arranged by Ma Zhanshan in this area, specifically to contain the Japanese army on the Qike road, so their retreat was not far away. The Japanese army dared not move far away from the traffic routes because they were afraid of the heat and mosquitoes. The two sides were still facing each other remotely. The battalion commanded by Ma Zhanshan himself had been retreating towards the east of Heilongjiang along the river between Bayan Mulan, Tonghe, and Tanghuyuan since the 7th, trying to draw the Japanese army away from the railway line and encircle them. The Japanese army planned to encircle them with the entire force of the Hiraga Brigade and the 6th Division and destroy the Heilongjiang army in one fell swoop between Qingcheng and Wangkui. In order to break the Japanese army's plan, Ma used the troops of Cai Hongyou and Li Tiande to harass various places on the Huhu road Xinglongzhen, Sihuantai in Suihua, and Zhaoxingzhen in Hailun, enticing the enemy in various ways. The movements of the various units were unpredictable. Xinglongzhen was once destroyed by Li Tiande's army on the evening of the 9th, and traffic was cut off. A small team of Japanese troops was annihilated and more than 40 Japanese soldiers were killed. There have also been battles in Beixingzhen recently. It is rumored that the Japanese army is at a disadvantage and reinforcements and planes have been sent from Hailun to rescue them. The details are still not very clear here. The Japanese army, wanting to defeat the main force of the Heilongjiang army, desperately pursued Ma Zhanshan's eastward march. Their battalions of cavalry and infantry moved forward in several branches, checking and responding to each other. Ma Zhanshan, fearing attacks by Japanese planes and avoiding marching in the summer heat, moved at night and, due to his familiarity with the geography, repeatedly caused the Japanese army to lose track of him. On July 9, Ma's battalion arrived at the Dahuangtai area near Bayan County and was caught up by the Hiraga Brigade of the Japanese army. They opened fire at 7 a.m. that day. The Japanese army used mountain guns and heavy artillery to attack from both sides, and four planes dropped bombs. Ma Zhanshan ordered the cavalry and infantry to divide and resist the enemy. At 10 a.m., the battle was at its fiercest. A plane, flying at low altitude, used machine guns to sweep downwards and was hit by a mortar from the Heilongjiang army. It caught fire in the air and fell behind the Japanese army's position. The other planes then stopped shooting at low altitude. Around 3 p.m., 700 cavalrymen from Cai Hongyou's brigade came to join the battle from the Huhu line, attacking from the rear. The Japanese army's position was thrown into chaos. Ma led his troops to take the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. The Japanese army suffered countless deaths and fled in panic towards Jiangjiadian. The Heilongjiang army then retreated calmly to Bayan. On the morning of the 10th, the troops of the Japanese Hitoe Branch rode Jianglun ships down the Songhua River to Wuhe. After landing, they wanted to respond to the Hiraga unit and attack Bayan from both sides. This was discovered by the Heilongjiang army. After the army landed, they were surrounded on the river bank and subjected to a frontal attack, killing about 300 enemies. Many were drowned in the river. That day, river navigation was cut off, and ships upstream and downstream could not pass. The remnants of the Hitoe branch were besieged for a day and night. On the morning of the 11th, 2,000 Japanese troops and a brigade of puppet Jilin troops were dispatched from Harbin, with the coordination of five planes, to rescue the remnants. Currently, the two armies are facing each other between Bayan and Mulan. The Japanese army continues to concentrate its forces there. Ma Zhanshan also dispatched the Tonghe and Tangyuan militia to support. A Japanese regiment in Yilan was originally going to return and sail up the river to attack the Heilongjiang army by water. However, on the evening of the 10th, because the soldiers were arguing with the puppet Jilin army in a brothel, 60 people were ambushed and killed by Liu Shu's 7th Brigade of the puppet Jilin army. The puppet Jilin army, fearing disaster, specially invited Li Du's army to attack, willing to be internal responders. Li's army, led by Lu Yongcai, had arrived 30 miles south of Yilan and had a fierce battle with the Japanese army. Although Liu Shu's brigade did not respond, they sat and watched, so the Japanese army could not move to support the Bayan area. As for the main cavalry force of Gong Changhai's army of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, it has arrived at Tumenling on the Jilin-Changchun road and is moving towards the provincial capital. A plainclothes team mixed into Changchun on the evening of the 9th and set fire to destroy two Japanese aircraft hangars. (July 11)</p>
<p>The Military Situation in Northern Guangdong Province is Tense</p>
<p>Twenty Regiments of Troops Have Been Dispatched in Recent Days</p>
<p>Bandit Activity Reported Again in Lianping and Heping in Eastern Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The fierce fighting between troops and bandits in northern Guangdong is intensifying. The 1st Army and 2nd Division are holding Ganzhou, the 1st Division is holding Dageng, the 4th Division is in Xinfeng, and other areas and transportation routes are occupied by bandits. The bandits who attacked Nanxiong on the 3rd were once repelled to Changpuwei, but the bandit forces are very strong and have invaded Nanxiong twice. Fortunately, Li Hanhun's Independent 3rd Division arrived in time to counterattack with Chen Zhang's Independent 2nd Brigade, and Nanxiong City was turned from danger to safety. However, Chen Zhang's brigade suffered heavy losses in this battle. Chen Jitang then continued to transfer four regiments of Zhang Da's 5th Division of the 2nd Army to provide support. Currently, a part of Zhang's division is defending Shixing and Renhua, and another part is defending Wengyuan. It is estimated that no less than ten regiments of troops have gathered in the Nanxiong and Shixing area, but there has been no progress. As for the 1st Division in southern Jiangxi, Division Commander Li Zhenqiu was wounded in the finger by a bullet while commanding operations in Dageng. It is also rumored that Tao Zuode's 3rd Air Force Team had two planes fly to the bandit area to bomb the bandits and were hit by the bandit army's anti-aircraft guns, but this may be a false rumor and is not known. Currently, news above Nanxiong is completely cut off. The 1st Army has been isolated from news from the rear for many days, so Chen Jitang has been continuously transporting troops north in recent days. The entire division of the Training Division (the most elite troops of the 1st Group) has been mobilized. The troops departing on the 11th were the 2nd Regiment of the division, led by Liang Gongfu; the troops departing on the 12th were the 3rd Regiment, led by Chen Hengyuan; and the troops departing on the 13th were the 1st Regiment, led by Luo Cejun. In addition, there are also the 4th Training Regiment of the 1st Army and two companies of the General Headquarters' anti-aircraft artillery team, which have begun to move to Xinghua and Shaoguan, and the entire Air Force Guard Regiment has also moved to Shaoguan. In total, there are another eight or nine regiments of troops, meaning that the bulk of the 1st Group Army's troops have now gathered in northern Guangdong. Miao Peinan, the division commander of the Training Division, originally also served as the chief of staff of the General Headquarters of the 1st Group Army. This time, since the Training Division is departing, Miao cannot personally supervise the troops, so Deng Longguang was specially appointed as the deputy division commander of the Training Division to command the Training Division's operations. Zhang Zhiying, the original deputy division commander of the Training Division, was transferred to serve as the commander of the fleet. In addition, in order to increase the strength of the Air Force, Chen Jitang recently transferred three planes from the 4th Air Force Team to the front. On the 12th, he ordered the Air Force Commander to personally lead the entire 2nd Air Force Team to the north. After Huang Guangrui and Ding Ji Xu Fengming received their orders, they personally drove a Caisse plane and led the 2nd Air Force Team to Shao on the morning of that day to prepare to command the various planes in combat. Since Huang and Ding's departure, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Air Force Teams under the 1st Group have also been fully concentrated in the Shaoxiong area. Bandit activity has been reported again in Lianping and Heping in eastern Guangdong. It is heard that Mao Zedong's troops, seeing that Nanxiong has strong troops and is not easy to invade, sent more than 3,000 bandit troops back to Longnan, passing through Dingnan and spying on Heping County on the Guangdong border. On the 9th, bandit traces were discovered in Shensi area of Heping County, about 80 miles from the county seat. The Lianhe and Heping counties urgently telegraphed the province to report the alert. The authorities immediately transferred Li Zhenliang's 13th Regiment of the 5th Division of the 2nd Army from nearby, taking the road through Heyuan Longchuan, and deployed to Heping County. They also transferred Huang Renhuan's Independent 1st Division from the Fujian border to rescue Lianping. On one hand, they also transferred the 1st and 2nd regiments of Wu Junsheng and Zhang Wei from the headquarters of the 5th Division from northern Guangdong, breaking out of Wengyuan to intercept Lianhe (July 13).</p>
<p>Zhu Mao Peng's Various Bands Fleeing to Northern Guangdong</p>
<p>The Bandit Troops Are Advancing into Guangdong in Three Routes</p>
<p>Five Provinces Mobilize to Encircle and Suppress the Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Zhu Mao Peng Li and other major bands, threatened by the Fujian and Hunan armies, advanced east along the Jiangxi-Hunan border and west along the Jiangxi-Fujian border, converging in Xinfeng Xunwu on the Jiangxi-Guangdong border. They advanced into northern Guangdong in three routes with great ferocity. Originally, after Zhu De returned to Ruijin, the false red capital, from Tingzhou in western Fujian, he convened a false high-level military conference. Bandit leaders, such as Xiang Ying, chairman of the false Military Commission, Zhu De and Ji Zhendong, commanders of the 1st and 2nd Group Armies, and above the false army commander, attended the meeting. It was decided to take advantage of the internal strife between the two Chens, the sparsity of the Guangdong-Jiangxi defense army, concentrate the bandit masses, and disturb Guangdong in three routes. After all, Guangdong is an area of wealth, and there are many civilian guns. If they break through Nanxiong Dageng and other places, they can seize a large number of guns, bullets, oil, salt, rice, cloth, etc., to compensate for the losses in Fujian. It was also predetermined that if they win, they will occupy Shaoguan and integrate the bandits in northern Guangdong, western Fujian, southern Jiangxi, and eastern Hunan. If they lose, they can also relieve the siege of Peng's bandits in Chongyi and Shangyou. After the red bandits' deployment was completed, they appointed Peng Dehuai and Li Mingrui's false 3rd and 4th Corps as the right wing to attack Nankang Dageng to exit Meiguan. Mao Zedong took the middle route, leading the false 15th Army, the independent 4th and 5th divisions, to exit Yudu Xinfeng and attack Nanxiong. Zhu De led the false 4th and 5th armies to exit the three southern provinces of Ruijin Huichang Wuping Xunwu Anyuan to spy on Heping. It has been reported for days that Zhu Mao Peng's three bands are attacking the county seats in the Dayu, Xinfeng, Sanan, and Nanxiong areas, and are fighting fiercely with the Guangdong armies of Li Zhenqiu Zhang Mei Xin Li Hanhun. The bandits suffered heavy casualties in the battles of Wujing Xintian Changpuqiao Huangxu. Currently, the internal disputes in Guangdong Province have been resolved. Guangdong troops have gathered in northern Guangdong. Gui army Wang Zanbin's division began to transfer to Shao in batches from Sanshui on the 8th to enter Jiangxi. Zhou Zuhuang's division will also continue to depart to engage in cooperative suppression. Xiang army Wang Dongyuan Chen Guangzhong and other divisions entered Jiangxi from the border between Guidong Suichuan Chongyi Shangyou, preparing to follow and tail when Peng's bandits fled east. Wang's division also captured the old nest of Peng's troops in Yingqian, a subordinate of Shangyou County, on the 10th. Check that Yingqian is between Suichuan Chongyi and Guidong, surrounded by high mountains and cliffs. Peng's bandits used this as a base after failing to attack Ganzhou last year, designating Chongyi Yougui and other counties as the false Xiangjiangxi Province, with Yingqian as the provincial capital. Various false agencies were set up here, serving as the general agency for redifying southeastern Hunan and western Jiangxi. When the Xiangyue Gan armies joined forces to suppress the bandits, they built bunkers around the four sides and set up defensive works to resist stubbornly. Recently, the Xiang army Wang's division, seeing that Peng's bandits disturbed Dageng to the east and only a few gunmen were stationed in the old nest, personally led Wang and Zhang's brigades on the 9th to attack by surprise. The bandits relied on their fortifications in Xianyan, Lima Mountain, Zizhu Mountain, etc., to try to defend to the death. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the division fought bravely and captured Yingqian completely on the 10th, destroying the false military headquarters of Peng's bandits, the Soviet government of the Xiangjiangxi border province, the Hexi Road Committee, the county and district Soviets, the wireless radio school, and more than 40 false agencies of the Red Post Office. An unknown number of bandits were killed. The corpses were scattered all over Yingqian. There were no traces of bandits. Wang's division will still take advantage of the victory to advance to Chongyi Dageng and join forces with the Guangdong army to attack Peng's bandits in Dageng. Peng's bandits have fled into Nankang, and Zhu Mao has also arrived in Sanan. It is heard that Commander-in-Chief He has telegraphed Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Cai Tingkai, and He Jian, discussing the suppression of bandits. The entire force of the Guangdong army will advance from northern Guangdong to southern Jiangxi. The Xiang and Gui armies will go east from the Xianggan border. The Fujian army will advance from Wuping Tinghang to Ruijin Shicheng. The Jiangxi armies will go south from the north of Yongfeng Nanfeng to Ningdu Guangchang to attack the rear of the bandit crowds. In other words, the five provinces' troops will take a surrounding style to the bandits' false Jiangxi province area (including Ningdu Ruijin Shicheng Guangchang Huichang Xunwu Yudu Xingguo Tingzhou Ninghua Shanghang Wuping and other counties), aiming to gather and annihilate the main force of the bandits. The mobilization of the provinces is no less than 300,000. It is also heard that He Yingqin is scheduled to return to Jiangxi on the 17th or 18th of this month to command everything (May 16).</p>
<p>After the 19th Route Army Arrived in Fujian, the Bandit Suppression Arrangements Were Completed</p>
<p>The Fujian People Set Up Incense Tables to Welcome Cai Tingkai</p>
<p>Zhang Zhen's Troops Are Under the Command of the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: After the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters was abolished, all the staff of about 70 people and the 2nd Battalion of the 60th Division's Training Regiment, led by Deputy Adjutant Wu Dian, arrived in Fujian on July 5 and were stationed at the old Governor's Office. The direct sign of the Fujian Pacification Director's Office has also been hung out. However, the internal organization must be implemented after Chief of Staff Deng Shizeng arrives in Fujian. The whole office is divided into seven departments: Staff, Secretary, Manager, Military Law, Ordnance, Adjutant, and Transportation. Except for the Transportation Department, which must participate in Fujian due to geographical reasons, the other six departments are all transferred from the staff of the Garrison Headquarters. The expenses are estimated to be 24,000 yuan per month. Army Commander Cai Tingkai will be able to come to the province within a few days. The Preparatory Office of the Grand Meeting of All Circles Welcoming the 19th Route Army has set up a five-color archway in the main location of Zhijie Street in the city and notified various agencies and organizations to recommend more than ten representatives. When Commander Cai arrives, they will gather at the Taijiang Wharf to welcome him. Along the way, all the shops on both sides will hang flags and set off firecrackers and set up incense tables to show respect. The welcome meeting will be held at the Public Sports Field on another date. The taxes in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou have been intercepted by Zhang Zhen and Chen Guohui for a long time. After the 19th Route Army entered the station, they promised to return them. The Department of Finance can send personnel to receive them within a few days. However, it is heard that Jiang Guangnai will not come to Fujian for the time being. The position of commander-in-chief will be held by Cai Tingkai, and the position of army commander will be held by Dai Ji. As for their bandit suppression plan, it is heard that Cai has already discussed it with Chen Jitang in Guangdong. The 19th Route Army will be responsible for attacking Changting in western Fujian, and Yu Hanmou's army in Guangdong will be responsible for attacking Ruijin in southern Jiangxi. At the same time, the Military Commission will assign Zhang Zhen's 49th Division, which is stationed in Zhangzhou, to be under the command of the 19th Route Army and be responsible for guiding. The 60th, 61st, and 70th divisions of the 19th Route Army are also stationed in a straight line from Quanzhou to Zhangzhou, and the deployment is roughly completed. They are waiting for Cai Tingkai to arrive in Fujian for inspection before the general offensive can begin. It is also planned to take three months as the bandit suppression period. After the red bandits are cleared, pacification will be carried out and miscellaneous troops will be compiled and disbanded, so that the chaotic situation in Fujian over the years can be renewed (July 11).</p>
<p>Misunderstanding Suddenly Arises Among Troops Stationed in Xuzhou</p>
<p>Xuzhou Communication: Xuzhou is located at the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai roads. The area around the railway station is inhabited by people from all walks of life. Since taking office, Garrison Commander Li Yannian has made great efforts to crack down on crime and maintain law and order. On the evening of the 15th, a tragic melee suddenly occurred on the main road of the East Station. Fortunately, due to effective prevention, it was quickly quelled. The Nanyang Apartment on the main road is inhabited by soldiers and civilians of the 9th Division and military supplies of the 68th Regiment of the 12th Division, as well as other travelers who looked like soldiers. At about 9 p.m. that evening, an officer of the 68th Regiment received military pay. Suddenly, someone claiming to be an officer and some hooligans broke in, intending to rob them. They immediately opened fire on each other. For a time, the sound of gunfire on the main road was deafening. Pedestrians ran around to avoid the bullets, and the order was extremely chaotic. The battalion headquarters of Xia Yaochun's 1st Battalion of the 51st Regiment of the 9th Division was located in the Yingbin Hotel opposite the Nanyang Apartment. They immediately sent a team to guard the area. Yang Yingzhi's regimental headquarters of the 68th Regiment of the 12th Division, located in the Datintai Hotel to the east of the Nanyang Apartment, also lined up to guard the area. During the exchange of fire, traffic from the East Station to the East Gate was completely cut off. At that time, Xie Fusan, the commander of the 51st Regiment of the 9th Division, went to the Yingbin Hotel to inspect his troops and happened to encounter the incident. He immediately reported to Li Yannian by telephone. Li ordered Xie to meet with Regiment Commander Yang to investigate and explain the situation. Around 11 p.m., the melee ended. Xie then went to Lin Jintai to meet Yang and explain everything to each other. He then went to the scene of the incident to investigate and saw two corpses lying outside the Nanyang Apartment and in the front courtyard, one being Huang Jing, a sergeant of the 68th Regiment, and the other being a corporal of the 68th Regiment, both of whom had been shot and killed. Soldiers of the 68th Regiment carried them into the upper room to be placed. Afterwards, he went to the main road to investigate and found another corpse lying in front of the Baochu Hospital, bleeding profusely and with brain matter shot out. The situation was extremely tragic. It was later found out that this was Peng Changfu, a pretender of a military officer, about 30 years old, originally residing in Room 12 of the Nanyang Apartment, claiming to be an officer of the 19th Route Army. Xie also went to Room 12 to inspect and found two letters left behind, addressed to his friends. The letters mostly spoke of buying and selling opium, and there were also two photos, which were searched and kept. After Xie inspected, he returned to the Yingbin Hotel. At that time, Xia Yaochun</p>

<p>Local News: Northwestern Aviation Route Actively Being Prepared. If the Fuel Problem Along the Way Can Be Solved, Full Operation Expected Within the Year. The Northwestern air route, actively being prepared by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, has already opened this year, with a section from Beijing to Lanzhou. Currently, preparations are underway for the entire length of the route, and it is expected that full operation will be possible within the year. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Mr. Wang Zhiyuan, the manager of the company, and Mr. Xu Mutang, the secretary, yesterday to inquire about the equipment for the Eurasia air route. They provided a very detailed response, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Motivation for Preparation</p>
<p>The preparation for the Northwestern air route was originally part of the company's plan. The company began preparations as soon as it was established. As a result, last year, it opened a route from Shanghai to Berlin, Germany. However, the route was quite circuitous, requiring travel from Shanghai to Ping, then north across Manchuria to Manzhouli, where German planes would take over to fly to Berlin. This route passed through Moscow, Irkutsk, and other places within Russian territory. Therefore, Russian trains were used for transportation from Manzhouli to Moscow. Only in Moscow were German planes used for the connecting flight. Consequently, there were significant delays along the way. Although it was much faster than boats or vehicles, the journey from Shanghai to Berlin still took seven or eight days.</p>
<p>Recent Decision</p>
<p>Last year, the Eurasia aircraft on our side mistakenly flew into Outer Mongolian territory and were forced to be detained, causing the Northwest route to be interrupted. After the September 18th Incident, the Northeast fell, and the recovery of Northwest aviation became hopeless. Therefore, the company sought other solutions. Mr. Li Jingcong, the former director of the transportation business group, went to Ping to prepare the "Hu Xin" route, meaning the route from Shanghai to Xinjiang. The route would pass through Shanghai to Nanjing, to Beiping, and then west to Dihua, which would be the midpoint. However, the company felt that this route was still too circuitous and inconvenient. So, they changed their strategy to make it a direct line from Shanghai to Dihua. Although there would still be some detours, it would not be a large detour. This is the company's most recent decision.</p>
<p>Trunk and Branch Lines</p>
<p>The current Northwest route takes the Shanghai-Xinjiang (Shanghai to Dihua) route as the trunk line and the Beijing-Ping line as the branch line. According to the original decision, the stops along the way include Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Luoyang, Guanyintang, Tongguan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, Hami, and Dihua. Currently, the trunk line only runs from Nanjing to Luoyang, and the branch line runs from Nanjing to Beiping. For the trunk line, there are plans to first extend it to Lanzhou and then to Dihua.</p>
<p>Fuel Problem</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Zhiyuan went to inspect the Northwest route in June and has now returned to Shanghai. He reported that the Northwest area has many high mountains and steep ridges, so the equipment for flying must be very reliable. The most difficult problem currently is the fuel issue. Because the area is mostly wilderness, there are no gas stations along the way. Once fuel is depleted, flight is impossible. The current plan is to transport fuel from Outer Mongolia using camels, as the area is mostly desert, and there is no other suitable means of transportation besides camels.</p>
<p>Date of Opening</p>
<p>The exact date for the opening of the Northwest air route has not yet been determined. However, if the company can proceed actively and the fuel equipment can be fully resolved, then a date for operation can be set. If progress is rapid, it should be possible to realize this by the end of this year. In the future, travel from Shanghai to Xinjiang will only take three days. Also, after this route is established, air travel between China and Germany can be connected from Dihua with German planes, directly linking to Berlin.</p>
<p>Wu Song Forts Closed to Visitors</p>
<p>The Wusong Fortress, originally a crucial gateway for national defense, has always been closed to visitors. Although the interior of the forts has been destroyed by warfare, the surrounding terrain has not changed. Now, the gateway is open, allowing anyone to visit. Moreover, foreigners often go there to take photos at will. If this is not prohibited, the terrain of the forts will be clear to everyone, not only revealing the weaknesses of the country but also greatly affecting reconstruction. Li Jingye, the Seventh District Chief of the Wusong Public Security Bureau, has received instructions from above to prohibit visits. He notified the Seventh Security Platoon stationed at the fort yesterday that, effective immediately, all people, both Chinese and foreign, are prohibited from visiting.</p>
<p>Deadly Epidemic: Death Within Minutes</p>
<p>Victim Was Wang Zaitang</p>
<p>Fear of Infection from Eating Yumberries</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, especially in the afternoons. The asphalt on the ground melts and softens, making it easy for people walking on the streets to contract the epidemic. Once contracted, it develops rapidly and is incurable, with some people dying within hours or even minutes. It is horrifying to hear. One afternoon at 1 PM, a man, Mr. Jia, around 50 years old and resembling a laborer, was carrying a basket containing two bowls each of cooked vegetarian dishes, including soybeans and eggplant. He intended to deliver them somewhere. While passing the Ningfu Lane entrance on Glock Road in the French Concession, he felt the epidemic and could not walk. He sat on the roadside and experienced diarrhea. Within ten minutes, he collapsed and died. A policeman reported the incident to the police station, which transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue for examination. As there were no family members, the Second Special Court was notified the next morning. Wu Xiaoke, a prosecutor, and a forensic doctor went to the morgue to examine the body and determined that the deceased had died from illness. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial. As the deceased died from the epidemic and the weather was hot, the body could not be kept for long. Therefore, photos were taken, and the body was immediately placed in a coffin and transported to the cemetery in Pudong for burial. It was not until yesterday afternoon that the deceased's sister, Zhao Wang, arrived at the hall and identified the deceased as Wang Zaitang, 51 years old, from Suzhou. She said that he had always been healthy and likely died from eating yumberries and contracting the epidemic. It can be seen that during this hot weather, food on the stalls is covered with flies. Buyers who are not careful and purchase such food are likely to cause a major life-threatening disaster and should be cautious.</p>
<p>A Couple Commits Suicide in the Bund Park</p>
<p>Embracing and Kissing at Night</p>
<p>Mandarin Ducks Die Together in the Waves</p>
<p>During the summer, the weather is hot, and public and private gardens have become popular places to cool off. There is a park on the south bank of the Huangpu River estuary, in the Shanghai area, which was established by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. Although not very large, it has green trees that provide shade. Visitors feel cool and refreshed because it faces the Huangpu River, and a gentle breeze blows from the river. Therefore, the park has been very popular recently, especially in the evening when the sun sets and the lights come on. People take advantage of their leisure time after dinner to come to the park to cool off. Modern men and women consider the park a good place to talk privately. They stroll hand in hand into the evening, and it is crowded even at midnight. Yesterday at 2:10 AM, a young man and woman were sitting side by side on a bench on the beach in the park. They were both dressed in modern attire. It was late at night, and there were very few visitors in the park. This couple was noticed by a Westerner sitting a short distance away. Although the Westerner could not hear what the two were saying and could not understand Chinese, their actions were very clear. He saw the two embrace and kiss for a long time, then suddenly walk hand in hand to the beach and jump into the river to commit suicide. Only splashes of water were seen, and their traces disappeared. The Westerner wanted to help but was too late. He waited until 3:25 AM when a Chinese patrolman, No. 45, from the Lujiazui Customs Water Patrol Station came by boat from a distance. The Westerner told him what he had seen in detail. The patrolman returned to the police station to report and record the incident for investigation. Although the young couple were buried in the river, their names, ages, and reasons for suicide are still unknown.</p>
<p>Dafeng Factory Workers Staged a Slowdown Yesterday</p>
<p>To Support Unemployed and Arrested Workers</p>
<p>Du Ruoqiu and Others Have Been Transferred to the Court</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, more than 100 unemployed workers from the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Guangfu Road in western Shanghai requested to return to work, resulting in a conflict with the police. Fifteen workers, including Du Ruoqiu, were arrested by the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. It has been learned that the arrested workers have been transferred to the court for interrogation. All the employed workers staged a slowdown yesterday, and the Third District Dyeing Industry Union has submitted a petition to the Party and government agencies for assistance. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrested Persons Sent to Court</p>
<p>The fifteen unemployed workers from the Dafeng Factory, including Du Ruoqiu, Cao Guisen, Huang Yugen, Dui Fuxin, Ye Yukuan, Jin Meilin, and Huang Guifang, were arrested by the Sixth District Police Station and then transferred to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After a brief interrogation, the Third Section, considering that the case involved assaulting police officers, transferred them to the court for trial on the afternoon of the 16th with a written report.</p>
<p>Employed Workers Staged Slowdown to Help</p>
<p>The factory originally had more than 400 workers. After the January 28th Incident, due to the decline in business, 108 workers were laid off. The remaining 300 workers continued to work in the factory. After the arrest of the 15 unemployed workers, all the employed workers were outraged and stopped working, demanding that the factory accept the unemployed workers' request to return to work. However, the factory did not accept the request, and the employed workers staged a slowdown to help. Yesterday, except for a small number of female workers (who were not members of the union and still went to work), all the male workers, more than 300, refused to work.</p>
<p>Union Reported to the Party and Government</p>
<p>The petition stated: "We are submitting this petition regarding the labor-management dispute at the Dafeng Factory. The matter has been reported previously, and we have recently been informed that personnel have been dispatched to investigate. Unexpectedly, the factory used the Sixth District Police Station to send a large number of armed police officers, led by Lu Shiyi, the personnel director of the factory, to the union hall, where they arrested worker Du Ruoqiu without cause. When they encountered Huang Guifang, a director and secretary of the union, they arrested him as well. When the workers saw this, they gathered in front of the district gate to demand the release of union director Huang Guifang and member Du Ruoqiu, maintaining order and without any disturbances. However, the police arbitrarily arrested the unarmed workers and physically assaulted them, even using box cannons to beat them until they were covered in injuries, arresting more than a dozen people. We do not know what laws the police district is relying on to interfere in the labor-management disputes of the union, and the innocent workers have suffered such pain. Under the Party's rule, how can such illegal actions be tolerated? Therefore, we implore your union (bureau) to uphold justice and handle the matter fairly, bring the perpetrators to justice, and advise the Public Security Bureau to release the innocent immediately, so as to deter others and ensure future stability. It is for the public good. We submit this to the Municipal Party Committee and the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Third District Dyeing Industry Union of Shanghai." It is also heard that the union has scheduled an emergency meeting today to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>False Alarm in Zhabei Last Night</p>
<p>Between 10:30 PM and 11:30 PM last night, gunshots were suddenly heard in the Zhabei area. Residents thought that another unfortunate incident had occurred and were greatly alarmed. Upon receiving the news, the newspaper immediately dispatched a reporter to investigate and found that the noise was caused by residents on Linping Road, who, superstitious about old customs, were holding a Taiping Gongjiao ceremony and setting off firecrackers. Fortunately, the Fifth District Third Police Station immediately dispatched police officers to stop the activity.</p>
<p>Elderly Man Killed by Bus</p>

An elderly man from Jiading, Lu Songquan, around 60 years old, wearing a gray cloth gown, was walking slowly and could not avoid the bus in time. He was knocked to the ground and suffered head injuries. Police officer No. 1212 from the Xinzha Police Station arrived at the scene, recorded the driver's information, and sent the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment.

The National Government Ministry of Finance recently transferred Liang to the position of director of the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp and Tobacco Tax Bureau. His vacancy has been filled by Wang Qinqing, appointed by the Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Lu Ziqing Sues Wife for Cohabitation</p>
<p>Wife Says She Was Never Formally Married</p>
<p>Debate Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Lu Ziqing, a native of Funing, recently sued his wife, Ji Fengqing, for refusing to return home and living with her mother. He believed that his mother-in-law, Ji Tao, and his brother-in-law, Ji Xiuquan, had instigated her actions. He hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court, requesting cohabitation. His argument was that he had married Ji Fengqing as his second wife ten years ago. They were initially harmonious and had a son and a daughter. However, in recent years, she was seduced by her mother and brother and dared to run away with her children in February of this year. Fortunately, he found her after searching everywhere, but after returning home and cohabitating for only a few days, she repeated her actions on April 2, taking all her belongings and her children while he was away. A neighbor surnamed Deng witnessed her brother, Ji Xiuquan, and others helping her hire a car and move away. While he was investigating, she preemptively filed a false accusation against him with the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate, claiming that he had abandoned her. The court issued a summons, and after a hearing, ordered them to cohabitate. However, after leaving the court, she was forcibly taken away by her mother and brother, preventing him from cohabitating with his wife and seeing his children. He was very angry and had attempted mediation, but it failed. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit, requesting that Ji Fengqing and her children be ordered to return home. The trial was held yesterday by Judge Qiao Wanxuan. Ji Fengqing hired lawyer Zhang Ding to represent her, while Ji Tao and Ji Xiuquan hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. Lu Ziqing first presented his case, requesting that Ji Fengqing be ordered to cohabitate. However, Ji Fengqing argued that she and Lu Ziqing were not husband and wife but were in a concubinage relationship. When she first met Lu, he falsely claimed that he had no wife. Later, she discovered that he already had a wife, but she could not undo the situation because they had children. Recently, he hid the children she had given birth to in Room 6 of the Nanyang Hotel in Xieqiao, intending to sell them. She discovered this and reported it to the police, who rescued the children. Moreover, he has no formal occupation and spends his days with hooligans, neglecting her livelihood. Given his malicious intentions, she could not possibly cohabitate with him and therefore refused to return home. Subsequently, lawyer Fan spoke on behalf of his clients, completely denying Lu's claims. Judge Qiao then declared the debate closed and adjourned the court to await a scheduled judgment.</p>
<p>Bandit Xu Aigen Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>The bandit Xu Aigen, a local, colluded with accomplices last month to rob in the Xinjing area in northwestern Shanghai. He used an axe to injure two victims, causing them to become severely and incurably disabled. After the incident, Xu was arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After interrogation, he confessed to the crime, and the victims confirmed his confession. Therefore, Xu Aigen was sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Hongkou Organizations Petition the Municipal Government to Revise Rent Exemption Measures</p>
<p>More than 20 organizations, including the Hongkou District Branches of the Citizens' Federation and the United Associations of Business Circles of Tangshan Road, Dongyouheng Road, Chuzhou Road, Yichuan Road, Yangshupu Road, Zhoujiazui Road, Broadway Road, East and West Huade Road, Yinxiang Road, Haining Road, Boundary Road, Kunnenghai Road, North Xizang Road, Chuanbao Road, Suzhou Road, North Shanxi Road, North Jiangxi Road, and Wuchang Road, resolved at the Sixteenth Representative Conference that the Hongkou area suffered from the atrocities of the Japanese army during the Songhu War, resulting in a strike lasting more than 60 days and causing significant losses. The rent exemption issued by the Municipal Government does not reflect the facts or human sentiment and is unfair. They requested the Municipal Government to revise it. The petition to the Municipal Government is attached below: The petition is regarding the issuance of rent exemption, which does not reflect the facts and is unfair. We implore you to revise the measures to address public opinion. We, the associations in the Hongkou area, have always been occupied by the Japanese. During the January 28th Incident, the defense committees of various countries were unable to intervene, and the area north of the Suzhou River was entirely controlled by the Japanese army, who carried out atrocities, slaughtering and raping at will, even using places like the Sanyuan Palace as killing machines. How could the people not flee? South of the Suzhou River, the 41st Army painfully opened the market, but the Hongkou area was in a state of terror and dared not rashly open the market, continuing the strike for more than a month, resulting in even greater losses. Since the advocacy of rent exemption, enlightened landlords, such as the Continental Bank, Shanghai Bank, Pacific Foreign Firm, and Dehe Foreign Firm, have been willing to exempt rent for three months. However, the issued notice on rent exemption grants up to two and a half months north of the Suzhou River. The following two points should be opposed: first, the municipal authorities have not weighed the facts and human sentiments and have issued inaccurate points. Second, how should the three months of rent that have already been exempted be handled, which has caused disputes. For the sake of resolving disputes among citizens, we urgently seek the issuance of rent exemption measures to alleviate the pain. Unexpectedly, the result is the opposite, greatly disappointing the people and causing public opinion to be in an uproar. Looking at the market after the disaster, it is extremely difficult. A three-month rent exemption in the Hongkou area north of the Suzhou River is not enough to demonstrate fairness. In order to eliminate market disputes and achieve peace, we have no choice but to appeal to your government to promptly withdraw the order and reissue measures to appease public opinion and alleviate the difficulties of businesses. We are deeply grateful and eagerly await your command.</p>
<p>Strictly Reject and Purchase Japanese Yarn Sold by Treacherous Merchants</p>
<p>According to Shishi News Agency, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the relevant trade associations yesterday regarding the thorough boycott of Japanese yarn: We have repeatedly received reports that various yarn shops in the city have recently imported large quantities of Japanese yarn and sold them to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Xiaoshi, Shengze, Songjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou, Changshu, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and other places. The Chamber of Commerce has invited the above-mentioned shops to send representatives to the meeting, hoping to warn them in person and awaken them to their mistakes. However, most of the representatives from the relevant associations have avoided attending, and the trafficking continues as usual. This shows that they are only seeking private gain and are ignorant of the overall situation. Words alone cannot be effective. The sales of Japanese yarn are mainly to cloth factories and sock factories. If they can mutually refrain from buying, then the treacherous merchants will be at their wit's end. At a time when Japanese warlords are openly declaring that the three northeastern provinces will never be returned to China, the Chinese people must fight to the end to prompt Japan to reflect. However, these treacherous merchants only know how to share the leftovers from the enemy and do not care that 30 million compatriots in the Northeast are trapped in a foreign land. Such madness cannot be tolerated among human beings. All of us Chinese people should boycott these treacherous merchants in the same way that we boycott the Japanese, so that the plan to sever economic ties will not be destroyed by them. We hereby request your association to strictly reject and purchase Japanese yarn sold by these yarn shops, so as to consolidate our shared hatred of the enemy. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Sha Tian Property Owners Given Deadline to Pay Price Increase</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government Shangbao Shatien Official Property Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating that official Hamadi land and the original new beach fields as well as the non-food overflow lands, all belong to the scope of Shatien's official property, which are all national properties. It is not permitted by law, regardless of the duration of occupation. Should there be those who happen to be hiding the occupation without reporting, then, not only will they be violating the provisions, but they will be abandoning their property rights. As for the case of Tian's supplementary prices, which was intended to pay for the land that people initially received, they were only required to pay for the beach. Once the land was enclosed and cultivated into fields, the income was abundant and the profits were high. Accordingly, the price of the field should be paid separately and be graded and taxed in accordance with the regulations. An announcement was issued previously urging each of the property owners in the case. Now it has been investigated that the case documents show that very few of the property owners have followed the rules to report and receive the supplementary price, while there are still many who deliberately conceal and delay, the reasons being to tidy up the old cases, rectify the national debts, and increase tax revenues. It is not convenient to let it drag on any longer. In addition to the county government strictly urging the reporting to receive and pay the price within a time limit, the announcement to each of the property owners will now be issued to inform all parties. All official Hamadi land, the original new accretion, and the enclosed and reclaimed Tian lands etc. must, from the date of this notice, come to the Bureau within one month to comply with the regulations for reporting, receiving the supplementary price, and grading the taxes. If there is a further overdue report in an attempt to resist, then, once it is discovered or reported, the punishment will be halved in accordance with the regulations. The matter concerns the interests of each of the property owners and should not be viewed as a mere formality, leading to self-misfortune.</p>
<p>Shanghai County District Chiefs Meeting Record</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held its 27th District Chiefs Meeting yesterday. County Chief Yan presided over the meeting, and Hu Gongshou took the minutes.

<p>Yingshi Memorial Hall Opens Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Memorial Hall of the Martyr Chen Gong Yingshi, established by the Lake Society in its office building under the order of the National Government, will hold its completion and opening ceremony tomorrow at 9 AM. Chairman Lin of the National Government and the Military Commission have sent Mayor Wu Tiecheng as their representative to attend. President Shao Yuanchong of the Legislative Yuan has sent a telegram to the society, reporting on Chen Gong's deeds. It is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Charitable Organizations Jointly Request Zhenyun to Continue Free of Charge</p>
<p>Various charitable organizations in the local area received Instruction No. 2151 from the Executive Yuan yesterday, which stated that the Ministry of Railways reported that there have been abuses and public criticism regarding the exemption of donations and freight charges for transporting Zhen products. It is heard that some treacherous merchants and gentry are colluding with each other to rent and manage Zhen, hoping to be free of charge. Some are lobbying to join the Zhenwu agency to run their own grain stations to transport grain. Some are specializing in secret solicitations to promote relief transportation. Last year, the Ministry transported more than 130,000 tons of Zhen grain and more than 500,000 sets of Zhen clothing. The freight losses on various routes exceeded 2.3 million yuan, and the Ping grain requested for transportation by various provinces and cities was not included. It is proposed that after the expiration of the free relief transportation period (end of June of this year), it will no longer be extended. The Executive Yuan submitted the proposal to the 42nd meeting of the Executive Yuan for resolution. After receiving this official document, the charitable organizations believed that tens of millions of disaster victims across the country are now clamoring for relief. If an additional burden of 2.3 million yuan is added to the railway relief transportation each year, even if it is taken directly from the relief funds, it is indirectly taken from the disaster victims. If one yuan can save one life, then if this is implemented, there will be more than 200,000 disaster victims starving to death in the ditches every day. It is heard that they are uniting various charitable organizations to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan, requesting that it withdraw the order.</p>

<p>Business News - Financial - Gold Market Weekly: Reaction After Five Consecutive Weeks of Rise; Unified Assessment Drops Thirteen Taels and Three Mace</p>
<p>Over the past week, the standard gold price has been in a state of near fluctuation, unpredictable. Daily differences have exceeded ten taels, leaving people in a fog. The demands of various firms have varied, and intentions have been complex, ultimately leading to decline. The August opening at the beginning of the week was relatively stable, dropping only four mace, to 761 taels. As the silver market continued to rise, drafts in this city also extended, but by Tuesday, it had suddenly broken through 750 taels, abruptly reaching 47.5 taels. Subsequently, the silver market seemed to contract, trending upwards. The highest price on Wednesday was 64 taels, but the situation was uncertain, fluctuating around 60 taels. Afterward, due to rollover considerations, there were many short positions. Although spot goods have seemed to increase recently, they ultimately needed to be covered, so they urgently advanced, returning to favorable conditions. By the weekend, there was a sudden shift to weakness. Unexpectedly, the Bank of England reported a rising trend again, and the London market seemed to have a bullish outlook. It had already re-entered 50 taels, and then closed at 48 taels and one mace. The total weekly difference was 16 taels and five mace, and the unified assessment fell by 13 taels and three mace compared to the previous Saturday, a reversal after five consecutive weeks of rise. However, Saturday happened to be the 16th, marking the beginning of the rollover, with September entering the market. The opening was 748 taels and five mace, and the closing was 45 taels and one mace, causing the short positions to cover 5.78 to 3 taels, but there was no excessive complexity. The positions of various firms, both long and short, were recorded in yesterday's report. The British and American silver markets have been rising for three consecutive weeks. The Shanghai British exchange rate rose by 1.5 increments (375), and the American exchange rate rose by only 25. The domestic market also tended towards relaxation. Sterling continued to rise by 375, exceeding eight pence, while the US dollar rose by only 31.25, actually due to smaller exchange rate reversals. Gold dealers and speculators were scrambling, and market conditions changed daily. The unified assessment of the British-US exchange rate fell by 3.75, and the US-British exchange rate also fell by 2.8125, while the settlement price was calculated around 70 taels in US dollars. Again, based on the transaction price of the day, the hedge was 30+ taels away (forward US dollar). The naked spot price was from 7 taels 7 mace 5 candareens to 7 taels. Finally, due to the rollover, it should be incrementally increased to 9 taels 7 mace 5 candareens. I will now extract the general overview of the week below.</p>
<p>Weekly Overview:</p>
<p>Monday:</p>
<p>Large silver rose again by 1875 to 125. US silver continued by 125. Sterling and the US dollar did not move. The internal market tended to harden. Dealers initially bought and then sold. The standard gold price for August opened at 761 taels, down only four candareens, because US silver rose but was short. Subsequently, it increased to 63 taels and eight mace. Afterward, sellers showed bravery, and the exchange market loosened, breaking through 60 taels. At noon, it was 56 taels and eight mace, and the closing was 58 taels and four mace. The afternoon opened at 58 taels and eight mace. Then, large holders sold off, dropping to the 50 tael mark, then to 53 taels and eight mace. By the closing, it was 3 taels and three mace, falling by 8 taels and one mace compared to the previous Saturday, the fourth day of slight decline. The highest price of the day was 63 taels and eight mace, and the lowest price was 50 taels, a difference of 13 taels and eight mace. The fluctuations were significant, and the settlements were complex.</p>
<p>Tuesday:</p>
<p>The rising trend of large silver had not yet ended. It increased by 125 to 1875. US silver increased by 25, and Sterling lengthened by 25. The US dollar also only increased by 25, which was a small exchange rate squeeze. The internal market tended to be different, loosening and then tightening. The gold market initially opened at 755 taels, rising by 1 tael and seven candareens, because the exchange rate had violently fallen. The private telegram silver price also increased by 25, especially as sellers drummed up the exchange rate, which loosened and flooded, falling sharply, breaking through 50 taels, finally reaching 47.5 taels. Then, various firms enthusiastically pursued, and the exchange market rebounded, the price flourished, soaring by more than 10 taels, reaching 58 taels and eight mace. The noon closing was 6 taels and two candareens, and the afternoon was 6 taels seven candareens to 7 taels five candareens. Later, because there seemed to be many sellers, it retreated to 54 taels and two candareens, suddenly jumping up 4 taels, reaching 58 taels and five mace. After Hengxing came to the market, the price fell again to 55 taels. By the closing, it was 57 taels, rebounding by 3 taels and seven mace compared to the previous day, a reversal after four days of slight decline. The highest price of the day was 58 taels and eight mace, and the lowest was 47 taels and five mace, a difference of 11 taels and three mace. The Guang gang jointly issued 1,300 taels, and hedge funds moved in.</p>
<p>Wednesday:</p>
<p>Large silver contracted by 0.0625, US silver contracted by 125, Sterling contracted by 125, and the US dollar contracted by 25. The internal market slightly contracted. The gold market initially opened, immediately adding 2 taels, reaching 59 taels, then 9.5 to 8 taels. Then, because large holders came to the market, it broke through 60 taels, reaching 63 taels and four mace. It fluctuated around 60 taels, reaching 59 taels. In the afternoon, it was 61 taels and three mace, and the afternoon was 62 taels, then 60 taels. Because there was no foreign exchange market on Wednesday, the closing was 62 taels and eight mace, continuing to rise by 5 taels and eight mace. The highest price was 64 taels, and the lowest was 58 taels, a difference of only 6 taels.</p>
<p>Thursday:</p>
<p>Large silver contracted again by 1875, US silver contracted by 125, Sterling did not change, and the internal market loosened. The gold market initially opened stably, at 63 taels and a half, slightly adding seven candareens, then 64 taels. Later, the market was small, because the exchange market loosened. Moreover, sellers exceeded buyers, and near noon it was 56 taels, with the closing at 58 taels. In the afternoon, it was 7.5 to 7.7 taels. Again, because the US dollar loosened further, the market supply flourished, retreating to 53 taels and three mace. Hengxing came to the market, reaching 56 taels. After entering, it was still weak, and by the closing, it was 54 taels and six mace, falling by 8 taels and one mace. The highest of the day was 64 taels, and the lowest was 53 taels and three mace, a difference of 10 taels and 0.7 mace.</p>
<p>Friday:</p>
<p>Large silver rebounded by 1875, US silver by 25, Sterling did not move, and the internal market seemed tight. The gold market initially opened, dropping by 4 taels and three candareens, to 750 taels and three candareens, then to zero one candareens. Afterward, it stepped into the clouds. Large holders and short positions advanced, and because the rollover was approaching, long positions continued to advance. At noon, it was 62 taels, and the closing was 60 taels and a half. The afternoon was 58 taels and three mace, then 8 taels and one mace. Because the rollover had started early, and the price was not high, only opening 4 taels, it soon rose to 6 taels, so the market price also increased to 63 taels and seven mace. Again, because there seemed to be many sellers, it dropped to 59 taels and six mace. By the closing, it was 60 taels and nine candareens, rebounding by 6 taels and three mace. The highest of the day was 63 taels and seven mace, and the lowest was 50 taels and one candareen, a difference of 13 taels and six mace.</p>
<p>Saturday:</p>
<p>Large silver increased again by 25 to 1875, US silver increased by 125, Sterling increased by 25, and the US dollar also increased by 25. The internal market slightly loosened. The gold market suddenly showed weakness. September had already entered the market, and August had no trading. The opening was 52 taels and three candareens, and the closing was 48 taels and one mace, falling by 12 taels and eight mace compared to the previous day. In half a day, there was a 6 tael and four mace fluctuation. This was due to the shift to September. September initially opened at 48 taels and a half, then 9 taels. The selling trend flourished, especially because large silver should not rise again, so people's hearts were weak. It suddenly reached 44 taels, then fluctuated around 50 taels, once reaching 51 taels and eight mace, and closed at 45 taels and one mace. The initial rollover was 5 taels and seven eight candareens, then around 3 taels. However, some firms had not yet completed the rollover. Now I will list the high and low prices of the silver market, drafts, and standard gold below.</p>

The early market for foreign clearing was 6 qian 9 fen 3 li 7 hao and a half, better by 7 hao and a half than the previous day. The noon market rose again by 1 li and 2 hao and a half, to 6 qian 9 fen 5 li. The result was a total increase of 2 li between the two markets. Although the apparent rising trend was strong, the actual underlying foundation was still difficult to be optimistic about, and it seemed to have a continued downward trend. Silver clearing rose again yesterday. The early market was 1 qian 5 fen, and the noon market was 1 qian 4 fen, rising by a total of 2 fen compared to the previous day's noon market. More than 5 million clearing tickets were traded, making drafts. The early market was 625,000, and the noon market was 430,000. There were no transactions in either paper money market.

<p>Securities: Last Week's Bond Prices Fluctuated Slightly Higher</p>
<p>Trends Mixed, with Over 20 Million Transacted</p>
<p>Last week (from July 11th to 16th), the transactions of spot and futures at the local Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were as follows: The inflow and outflow of spot financial assets fluctuated sharply, while other transactions remained scarce. The total weekly transaction volume was 600,100 yuan, of which financial assets accounted for 500,000 yuan, 194,700 yuan for unified assets, 26,000 yuan for customs duties, 10,000 yuan for 19 bonds, and only a few thousand yuan for the remainder. 96 bonds have not been issued. In the futures market, price fluctuations were relatively large, and market sentiment was slightly more active. Moreover, the August futures market gradually became active, so the transaction volume far exceeded the previous period. The total transaction volume for the week was 19,575,000 yuan. Unified taxes accounted for a larger portion, with 3.14 million yuan for July and 1.12 million yuan for August. Unified taxes accounted for 2.36 million yuan for July and 765,000 yuan for August. 20 customs bonds accounted for 1.985 million yuan for July and 645,000 yuan for August. 20 cigarette bonds accounted for 1.995 million yuan for July and 685,000 yuan for August. 19 charity bonds accounted for 2.005 million yuan for July and 145,000 yuan for August. Demobilization bonds accounted for 1.035 million yuan for July and 790,000 yuan for August. 19 customs bonds accounted for 1.38 million yuan for July and 240,000 yuan for August. Reorganization bonds accounted for a total of 640,000 yuan, and customs duties accounted for 420,000 yuan. The current month of issued "Whole 6" bonds accounted for only 150,000 yuan, and only 75,000 yuan for "Nine Six" bonds. There was also no market for the August issues. As for the trend of bond prices during the week, they were more active than the previous week. The first day of the week was the most sluggish, with supply and demand both clear, and minimal changes. On Tuesday and Wednesday, market sentiment suddenly became optimistic, and investment and inflows were quite active. Buying sentiment surpassed selling, and prices rose uniformly, with daily rebounds ranging from 45 cents to over 1 yuan. Thursday was quiet, with prices rising before falling. On Friday, as the situation showed little progress, prices fell back by around 56 cents. On the last day of the weekend, market sentiment was dull, with minimal fluctuations. Judging from the situation, it seemed that it would gradually become calm and difficult to develop for the time being. As a result, it rebounded slightly compared to the previous week. Except for the 20 cigarette bonds and spot unified taxes, which had no market on the weekend, each rose by 1 yuan and 20 cents. The others improved by 12 cents to around 78 cents. The high, low, rise, and fall of each bond during the past week are listed below: (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn and Foreign Cotton Had No Major Ups or Downs</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially weak due to poor news from Liverpool, but then strengthened due to lack of rain in drought areas and short covering. Futures rose by two to five points, and spot prices rose by five points. British cotton futures rose by three or four points, spot prices rose by six points, Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by ten points, and Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (16th telegram):</p>
<p>US Cotton | Change from Previous Day | Combined Application Rules | British Cotton Change from Previous Day | Combined Application Rules</p>

<p>Grain: The River Rice Market Fell and Then Hardened</p>
<p>South Shanghai:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a relatively scarce supply from various gangs, arriving at about five or six firms. Stocks were not weak. City and rural shop sales have long been bottoming out. Since the Japanese Incident, customers have raised prices, causing people to become depressed. Transactions were slightly more numerous. Thick japonica rice immediately rose by 2 jiao. The rural village gang slightly moved, with opening fluctuations of 3 jiao. Although the quantity of clear ocean pointed goods was scattered, sales were sluggish, and market prices temporarily followed the original level.</p>
<p>New Gate:</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were some arrivals, about fourteen or fifteen firms. Those approaching the market in the morning were not enthusiastic. Thick japonica top goods were particularly stable. The mid-range shop appetite gradually moved, and prices slightly rose. Thin indica arrivals and sales were even, and the situation continued to strengthen. Early rice was intermittent, with no standard, because stock arrivals were low, and buyers were not paying attention. Prices were stable. The transformation of Yin yuan wine households still had strong demand, and market prices rose by about 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Coarse Sugar and White Sugar Rose Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association market was actively transacting. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sugar and white sugar had good demand and were extremely popular. Market prices therefore steadily rose. The initial market transaction price was 14 taels 2 qian, and high-quality goods were 14 taels 3 qian, but there was a great shortage of outbound goods. In the later market, high-quality goods rose to 14 taels 3 qian and a half, quoted at 14 taels 4 qian, and ordinary goods were 14 taels 3 qian. The market situation was quite attractive. Taikoo sugar B mark was 16 taels 3 qian, CW mark was 15 taels 8 qian, and DY mark was 15 taels 5 qian. Transactions were quite active, and the trend was strong. H mark was 12 taels 5 qian, HX mark was 15 taels 4 qian, and HM mark was 15 taels. Transactions were relatively sparse, and the market was stable. The number plate was from Huaxin, selling 2,000 bags of coarse sugar and white sugar, priced at 14 taels 3 qian. The trade intentions were extremely strong, and the market looked strong, with signs of further increases.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Xin Jinshan Branch Number Plate Turned Upward</p>
<p>A batch of genuine marine goods from Xin Jinshan Branch arrived yesterday. Because it was the first time seeing new goods and the prices were reasonable, demand was quite strong, resulting in supply not meeting demand. The market suddenly turned favorable. Yesterday, the number plate from the North City business was already opened. Flat branches rose to 40 taels, and yuan branches rose to a higher level of 32 taels, and next 30 taels to around 29 taels. Transactions were opened in full.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Last Week's Silk Market Became Even More Lifeless</p>
<p>Japanese silk is aggressively selling into the mainland...Factory silk sales to Japan are trending sluggish...European and American silk factories are reducing work during summer vacation...Raw silk consumption is greatly reduced...</p>
<p>During the middle of last week, the local foreign firm silk market became even more lifeless, with barely any market activity to record. Japanese silk is actively dumping its products, which is the biggest reason why the sales of Chinese silk are becoming increasingly sluggish. European and American markets are flooded with Japanese silk. Silk weaving factories are all reducing work and stopping machines during the summer vacation. The inquiries for Chinese silk telegraphed in from Europe and America are very rare. Recently, white factory silk has been entirely reliant on the demand from mainland silk merchants, and transactions are still not deserted. Unexpectedly, lately, Japanese silk has been encroaching on mainland sales, greatly affecting the sales of silk from domestic users. Last week's transactions suddenly became sparse, and prices also plummeted by dozens of taels. Market sentiment became increasingly sluggish. European and American Chinese silk markets almost had transactions without trade. The prices of Chinese silk at the end of last week are listed below: (Unit: Gold Yuan per pound in New York, Unit: Franc per kilo in Lyon)</p>
<p>Silk Type | New York | Lyon | Silk Type | New York | Lyon</p>
<p>High-Grade Shanghai Warp | 1.35 | 96 | Superior Dry Warp | 1.14 | 68</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Warp | 1.23 | 81 | Medium-Grade Dry Warp | 1.02 | 56</p>
<p>Medium-Grade Shanghai Warp | 1.11 | 70 | Low-Grade Dry Warp | 0.88 | 42</p>
<p>Low-Grade Shanghai Warp | 1.00 |  | Superior Large Warp | 1.08 | 61</p>
<p>Superior Shandong Warp | 1.14 | 80 | Low-Grade Large Warp | 0.82 | 40</p>
<p>Superior Sichuan Warp | 1.12 | 7 | Superior White Silk | 0.85 | 30</p>
<p>Superior Gray Warp | 0.02 |  |</p>
<p>The Finale of the Wutun Tea Market</p>
<p>Wuyuan:</p>
<p>Local tea firms did not dare to increase production to the fullest extent because the Shanghai market was sluggish and prices were low. Those who were cautious mainly focused on completing one batch of tea and closing the market. In the past ten days, about fifty companies in various villages have completed production and closed the market. There are also companies with more daring, who are continuing to purchase local mountain household goods because current mountain prices are low and the Russian Estate Cooperative will soon begin operations, and tea sales are gradually turning around. Therefore, in recent days, there have been more instances of opening scales and conducting transactions. Prices range from 42 yuan to 50 yuan, which is 20 yuan lower per dan than the initial market price.</p>
<p>Tunxi:</p>
<p>In the Tunxi market, sales of rare needle embroidery tribute grades of boxed tea transported to Shanghai by various firms have gradually started in the past ten days. Except for the fact that rare market prices are difficult to increase, the rest are similar to last year. The concerns of the firms about tea sales being stagnant have now been slightly alleviated. However, the influx of tea to the source is still surging. According to a recent survey, there is a huge stockpile of more than 6,000 dan. If the Shanghai market becomes popular from now on, the appetite of each firm will still be quite substantial, so the tea hawkers are actually more anxious than the tea firms. The shop and estate tea bandits, who once sold well for a time, have recently seen their market prices fall to 20 yuan due to full stomachs and fine sales, 16 yuan lower per dan than before. Those who generally collected tea bandits have stopped operations because of this.</p>

<p>Report on Comfort Money</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army's heroic resistance against Japan in Shanghai has been recognized worldwide, and there is no need for further praise. Yesterday, the General Headquarters of the 19th Route Army sent the first report on the receipt of comfort money for the anti-Japanese war, and I cannot help but make some expectations on this point.</p>
<p>It is a common thing for people from all walks of life to comfort the 19th Route Army, and for the 19th Route Army to report the total amount of income and expenditure to the public after receiving the comfort money. However, in the current military and political organs, such bright and upright actions are rare.</p>
<p>Our newspaper receives work reports from various provinces and agencies every day. Opening them up, we see that they are mostly grand and ornate articles. The result is nothing more than self-promotion, vigorously touting themselves in every possible way, which is meaningless. When the 19th Route Army was bravely fighting the enemy in Shanghai, people from all agencies were angered by the enemy's aggression, and everyone's blood boiled, generously donating money to comfort the soldiers. The people were just doing their part to serve the country, and did not care about the amount of income and how it was distributed.</p>
<p>The first report of the 19th Route Army reported the total amount of comfort money received in detail to the public, and the report on the use of comfort money stated that how it was distributed was temporarily kept secret due to military secrets, and would be announced to China and foreign countries immediately at the appropriate time to show credibility. What a bright and upright action this is.</p>
<p>The hard-earned money of our people is paid to officials every year in the form of donations, taxes, and public bonds, etc., but we have never seen officials take such beautiful actions, reporting a detailed account to the people. Although the people of our country only have the obligation to pay taxes and no right to supervise the use of funds, in their hearts, they always feel a little uncomfortable and unhappy.</p>
<p>Literary Sentiment - Chen Jiaqing</p>
<p>Hearing that the eastern capital is full of auspicious atmosphere, famous scholars are happy to meet. It is a pity that those who flock to Luoyang, who is like Lu Shilong in the clouds.</p>
<p>The Ancient City's Spiritual Qi is Declining</p>
<p>Six years have passed, and looking back, I am filled with emotion. What is the benefit of the dragon coiling and the tiger crouching? It is better to lightly throw it to the general.</p>
<p>The clothing and hats of the southern kingdom are scattered like clouds, leaving only the old fort hanging in the setting sun. The Begonia flowers fall late in the city corner, and the lonely Zhongshan faces the ancient tomb.</p>
<p>Ten thousand are grinding horizontally, bitterly fighting each other, laughing at the difficult brothers and difficult brothers. The halberd gate and the Ba River are really child's play. Who is the general in the Xiliu Camp?</p>
<p>Volunteer Army - Song Zhai</p>
<p>Loyalty and righteousness soar into the clouds, not fearing the powerful neighbors oppressing our people. With shared hatred, we shed blood, and all directions respond by raising flags.</p>
<p>The winds and clouds in the north of the border are changing. How can the ambition of a man be diminished? Being able to escape from the tiger's den is no less than Ma Yuan in those years.</p>
<p>Science: The Method of Making Nitric Acid - Dream</p>
<p>As for China's acid industry, it is still in its infancy. There are only one or two manufacturing plants in the country, and they are small in scale and outdated in methods. They are mostly attached to military factories, so their output is only enough to supply the military factories, let alone industrial and agricultural industries. Now, the Ministry of Industry is planning to sign a contract with Germany to jointly build a large-scale manufacturing plant in Pukou to supply national defense industries. This is a very good intention. Among the important acids, the methods of making hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid have already been published in this journal one after another, so now we should sequentially describe the method of making nitric acid.</p>
<p>The Method of Making Nitric Acid Using Saltpeter</p>
<p>This method is used in industry and in the laboratory. However, since the invention of the new method, this method has gradually been eliminated in industry. The method is to mix nitrate and acid, and nitric acid is formed by chemical reaction. Commonly used nitrate is sodium nitrate, and the acid is sulfuric acid, because it is cheap.</p>
<p>The Method of Using Nitrogen in the Air</p>
<p>Although there is a lot of nitrogen in the air, it is extremely difficult for humans to combine it with oxygen, except for a small portion of plants that can directly use it. Even at a high temperature of 3,000 degrees, the amount of nitrogen combined with oxygen only accounts for 5%. However, since the invention of the use of electricity, countries with extremely cheap electricity prices, such as Sweden and Norway, have all adopted this method. The method is to introduce air into the two poles of the discharge, and part of the air becomes nitrous oxide. Then the temperature is lowered to about 400 or 500 degrees, and the nitrous oxide is combined with the air to form nitrogen dioxide. This purple-yellow gas becomes commonly used nitric acid after being absorbed by water.</p>
<p>The Method of Manufacturing by Platinum</p>
<p>During the European War, Germany used it most frequently. 精 gas is mixed with air and passed through a platinum plate catalyst, and dilute nitric acid is formed by gasification. However, the gas must be clean when passing through, otherwise, it will be very harmful to the catalyst.</p>
<p>Nitric acid is a very strong acid and is rich in oxidizing properties. It is very easy to catch fire and can be used to make powerful explosives and smokeless gunpowder. If it is combined with lime, it becomes fertilizer. Other things such as artificial ivory and artificial pigments cannot do without it.</p>

<p>Falling into Financial Straits</p>
<p>The Japanese Minister of Finance Lamented This.</p>
<p>Havas, Tokyo Correspondence, 16th - When someone asked the Minister of Finance for his opinion on the falling price of Japanese gold, the Minister replied as follows: "Since the beginning of Japanese history, it has never experienced such difficult times. Whether looking at the financial problem, the relief of farmers, or the Manchurian problem, each alone constitutes an extremely serious problem. Some say that Japan is currently engaged in a major battle involving life and death, and this is no exaggeration. However, the Japanese people do not seem to fully understand this serious situation. In Britain or the United States, the government can increase taxes, reduce spending, or attempt to reduce the military. Why are these methods feasible in countries like Britain and the United States? Because their people can cooperate with the government. What about Japan? Our neighbors, the Chinese and the Russians, are forcing us to use troops. We have no choice but to maintain our military, so that there is no room for savings in the military. Judging from the current situation, it is necessary to issue patriotic bonds. However, to prevent an emergency against foreign powers, we are particularly unwilling to use up part of our existing financial resources again, especially since our existing financial resources are not sufficient in the first place. As for increasing taxes, it only makes up for the budget deficit, which is not very helpful. Moreover, even if we intend to increase taxes, it is impossible given the current situation. Considering the situation of the Japanese state, there can be no optimism. The longer the term of bonds issued abroad, the lower their value, which shows that foreign countries hold a pessimistic view of Japan's future. The continued fall of the Japanese yen is due to the reduction of our country's real economic power, so I have no way to prevent it from falling further. Any attempt to rescue the currency price by unnatural methods will ultimately be in vain, and will instead give speculators new data. Therefore, at present, there is no other way but to let it take its natural course. Speaking of this, I am truly heartbroken, but there is nothing I can do. I am extremely concerned about the future of Japan. My only hope is that things will turn around after reaching an extreme, and that there will be a turning point after exhaustion."</p>

<p>New Wine in Old Bottles</p>
<p>Rengo, Tokyo, 17th - The Army authorities, as a result of extremely important and careful consideration of the problem of unifying the four-headed politics of Manchuria, have decided to revise the original plan. Minister of the Army Araki submitted his revised plan to the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister after yesterday's cabinet meeting, requesting consideration. The points that have been revised are as follows: (1) The Director-General system may cause misunderstandings of interfering in Manchurian politics, so it is changed to the Manchurian Special Envoy Plenipotentiary Office. (2) Therefore, the Special Envoy Director-General is changed to the Special Envoy Plenipotentiary, and the Deputy Director-General is changed to the Secretary-General. As for the Financial and Colonial Industries Bureaus, they are not actually necessary, and are changed to the Internal Affairs and Criminal Affairs Bureaus. Japanese councilors are dispatched to the Manchurian State Council to guide the administrative affairs of Manchuria.</p>
