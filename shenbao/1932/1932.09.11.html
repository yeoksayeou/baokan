<h3 id="c1">根本否認所謂「满洲國」華· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>嗚呼。吾東北三十餘萬方里土地。痛遭沉淪。三千萬勤苦同胞。慘受荼毒。詢及一周年矣。而日人以武力威脅手段製造之僞組織。成立以還。亦已半載。凡吾國人。丁兹巨變執不髮指眥裂。在前所以忍氣吞聲。徘徊審慮以待者。蓋冀正誼人道。尚有力量。公法公约。足資保障。不必以暴力對付暴力故也。欲以平和手段。解决中日糾紛。免除第二次世界大戰之隱患故也。不意日人始終甘與正誼以及公約爲敵。不察吾國人一片顧全大局之苦心。反而變本加厲。將進一步承認其所謂「满洲國」而與締結條約。是而可忍。孰不可忍。</p>
<p>夫所謂「满洲國。」如果出於東北民衆自發的行爲。而確有國家之形式。日本欲承認之。猶可說也。今满洲係日本武力侵佔。之土地。溥儀輩傀儡登塲。又出於日人之玩把戲。且一切實權。盡操於日本軍閥之手。使我東北同胞。切齒痛憤。咸抱借亡之志。試問在我東北。何國之有。於此而謂有「满洲國」之存在。而發生所謂承認問題。寗非古今未有之奇聞。其所以必欲立「满洲國」名目而承認之者。無非欲裂我土地。劃歸已有耳。内田嘗表示「日本割裂中國領土之計畫必須完成。中國縱令在條約範圍以内。對日如何讓步。不能回復東三省之主權。」日本將與其所謂「满洲國」訂立之條約。又包含日本在满有駐兵權並担任满洲對内對外之防務諸點。由此可見日人心目中。其實亦無所謂「满洲國。」其成立所謂「满洲國。」不過表示其侵略之决心。並利用之以遮掩其今後侵略之行爲而已。</p>
<p>羅外長有鑒於此。早已聲明「任何解决東北事件之辦法。苟以由日本武力創造維持與支配東省僞組織爲前提者。中國絕對不能同意。」政府根本否認僞國之存在。於此可見。兹據日本電訊。昨日上午駐日蔣公使往訪荒木。交換重要意見。而荒木表示「满洲國」之成立。已逾半年。拘泥過去之事。殊爲不可。準是而言。荒木對於承認「满洲國」之方針。仍無變動。然試問日本若不變更其承認「满洲國」之方針。其他解决東北事件之辦法。中國何能同意。今日國民。唯有一致對外。一面向世界各國表示中國國民根本否認阻梗平和解决東北事件之「满洲國。」日本果悍然承認僞「满洲國。」即不啻隳滅世界種種和平之保障。他日東亞如果因而發生不幸之變故。應由日本負其責任。一面更宜本百拆不撓之精神。誓以種種犧牲甚致不惜頭顱熱血。爲政府貫澈根本解决東北事件方策之後盾。</p>

<p>閻王鼻子膽戰心驚</p>
<p>二十五日之晨、我軍將離洛川、彼此不覺中心懦惴、如大難之將至、蓋預閱行程單、知我等卽將於啟行後、遇閻王鼻子、九倒手山也（路名）、行路之艱險、聞其名、卽可知其一斑、時組長胡君、亦頗以此行異常艱險爲虞、詢問當地人士以繞行地道之法、則答以豹子頭對、實則　王鼻子爲夾　脚夫等所稱、豹子頭爲當地民衆所名、二者名稱上雖不同、而實則仍一地也、六時半進早餐時、我等聞胡君報告可繞道避行閻王鼻子之言、咸大喜過望、七時各事均就緒、整裝就道、予與歐君等五人乘馬先驅、初尚平坦易行、未覺所苦、一小時後、則所謂閻王鼻子九倒手山者來、始則山路斜向下行、幾如壁立、去而復來、連線不絕、令乘騎者不禁爲之膽戰、旣而一山已過、渡一小溪而前、則面前更有大山阻路、策馬直上、愈高則傾斜愈小、未及山腰、五馬已同時氣喘不已、仰望山頂、羣　聞人聲四起、似將乘人之危、以膏其牙吻者、予等至此、惟有翼翼小心、策馬向上行、比抵山頂平地、人馬俱已汗流夾背矣、十時半、予等渡結子河而抵結子河鎭、該鎭祇有居民數家、十分冷落、河流窄而急、予與歐君取巨石投之中流、以便後來者之拾級而渡、無須各裸足而始濟、越半小時、全部陸續到齊、各各在石桌之旁、大吃無餡冷饅頭以果腹、頗饒特殊風味、</p>
<p>十二時半、我等復揚鞭就道、途中談及洛川縣長劉正亨、出身北大、頗具幹才、志不在百里也、一小時後、我等以爲自結子河至鄜縣祇四十五里、預計時間、我等當可於三時半左右抵鄜休息、不意一山旣過、他山又來、爬山越嶺、其苦不减於閻王鼻子、俄而繞行山側小　、細石零亂、每易乘騎傾蹶、而俯視下方、則巨石崢嶸、危崖壁立、洛水潺潺之聲、似警告遠行者之兢兢就道者、四時半左右、始抵鄜縣、則縣長賈克勤等已在洛水旁迎候、予等登彼岸後、入城休息、賈君等則往大道歡迎全部乘坐夾　之團員、因途行艱苦、直至天昏日暮、始絡繹而來、是晚各人以所行至少在百里以上、均困乏不堪、晚餐後十之六七咸上牀鼾睡、不似前此之精神充足矣、</p>
<p>鄜縣雖有鑛産、而多未開發、在短少怱促之時間内、欲搜查考察資料、殊屬不易、因之我等仍决定於翌晨（二十六日）離鄜縣而赴甘泉、聞路途甚平坦、不似洛鄜道中之驚魂動魄、</p>
<p>終身幾不知魚味</p>
<p>二十五晚縣長賈君爲予言、鄜地無魚、居民幾終身不知有魚味、卽在離較遠之地、獲得少量之魚、其長度亦不過二三寸、居民更鮮知烹魚及食魚之法、以故味旣不甚適口、而魚骨更時刺鄜人之喉、鄜之人或以食魚爲畏途也、其他情形如後、（甲）鑛産　（一）煤鑛有二、一在距城東四十里地之牛武鎭、形勢最佳、煤質多塊狀而堅黑、面積約十里、藴量約三十兆噸、該鑛曾經開採、年産五百餘噸、民國九年後以地聲而停止、其二在距城西六十里地之張村　及七十里地之劉氏庵等處、面積約各二十方里、以鄕民惑於風水之說、中止開採、（二）在城北十二里地之採銅川、該地適在太和山、以尚未開採、詳細情形不明、（三）銀鑛在縣西北隅二百里之石廠子、聞成分極佳、每鑛石百斤、約有銀質七十斤、昔曾有蜀人前往開採、因未用科學方法失敗、（四）鐵鑛在縣北六十里西川之姜家川鎭、該地亦産煤、</p>
<p>（乙）農産　全縣共有地三四七八一一畝、其中計種大麥二千畝、總收穫八十石、小麥五千畝、收四百石、筦豆二千畝、收六十石、粟谷五　七</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>千　、收二千八百五十石、粟谷五萬八千畝、收二各九百石、黄豆三千畝、收一百二十石、包谷一萬六千畝、收八百石、　麥七千畝、收二百八十石、高粱十二萬四千畝、收三千八百二十石、此該縣農産之大概也、今年田賦約可收一萬六七千元、民生凋敝、尤以農家爲尤、現多有棄其田産而逃亡他　　、</p>
<p>（丙）其他　全縣約三萬餘人、男較女約多四百餘人、他省　此居住、多爲四川山東等處之民衆、教　有天主教及墓督教等、城内有織造地氈廠一家、出品優美而價廉、皮革如羊狐豹狼之類亦多、其他情形多與附近各縣雷同、城内有高級小學一、約有學生七八十人、初級女子小學一、約有學生三十人、初級小學（男子）一所、學生約一百二十人、此外另有初級小學十六處、分設各鄕各鎭、每年教育經費約六七千元左右、教員薪水、每月約自十元至十五元、學費免繳、惟每學期須納體育費及雜費各五角、</p>
<p>洛水由甘泉縣境而下、自北繞城之東門而南行、水大時則泛濫無制限、侵及阡陌、農産物受其影響、水淺時、則河底枯涸、不足作田家灌溉之用、故洛水之在陜、有百害而無一利、較黄河爲尤劣、本月十一日、洛水忽漲、水深三丈餘、將灌入鄜城、居民驚恐備至、幸半日後卽退落、否則爲害之烈、將不堪設想、</p>
<p>予等在山中行走時、煤塊俯拾即是天予吾人之富藏如此無如交通阻隘、一如蜀道之難行、遂至貨棄於地無人過問、卽有志之士、爲之集資開掘、而轉輾運輸、所費甚大、如西安之煤、有時竟至每噸五六十元、較上海幾爲二倍、一遇競爭、亦决無戰勝之價值、總之陜北或中國其他各處、若長此關山難越、一無交通上之補救方法、則雖满地黄金、無異糞土、凡身入陜中、目覩此間環</p>
<p>境之人、均有此同樣之感想、願秉政者注意及之也、（八月二十六日晨自鄜縣寄）</p>
<p>跑出幾隻狼來</p>
<p>二十六日臨行時、以鄜縣縣長賈氏堅請留影以爲紀念、致較平常出發時間延遲一小時、全體旣渡洛水、緣山披低處行、約四五里、始各上夾窩或其他坐騎、取時計觀之、業已八時餘、是日所行路程果極平坦、兩旁野花爭枅、田中花開已盛之蕎麥、一望無際、似爲青青綠野、蓋上一淡紅色之紅氈、異常姣艶、山正青、花正好、除無碧水綠波、以爲風景上之點綴外、無其他不足、</p>
<p>自西安出發以來、鎭日天隂者、此爲第一次、午後一時左右、全體旣行五十里而抵倒坐堡天雨如細絲熱度爲之低落不少在夾窩中、冷風迎面來、覺關中草尚未袤、而天氣已有凉秋九月之氣味、僅衣單衣數襲之長途旅客、知將不足以禦寒、而沿途陸續　置棉衣矣、</p>
<p>倒坐堡啟行後、平地與山坡互易而來、山坡地祇有一處、路闊僅尺餘、而下臨無地頗爲危險、坐夾窩者、多出窩而步行、以避意外、獨胡厥文君以正在熟　中、未曾跳下、余亦以連日白日則長途跋涉、拼命趕路、傍晚則與當地人士交換意見、考察一新至地之概况、夜深則伏案在燭光或火油燈前作稿、至翌晨二三時始臥、晏眠早起、精神委頓異常、至是遂亦株守蜷臥夾窩中、聽其自然、幸各安然過去、未有所苦、沿途山麓見煤苗之暴露於外者、遍地皆是、惜煤層甚薄、厚僅一二寸、是否有開採之價值、亦一問題也、</p>
<p>五時半正遥見甘泉縣城墻、而該縣縣長及其他方面已在郊外歡迎、組長胡君等遂復下窩、與歡迎者互道寒暄、並致謝意、旣而步行人甘泉城、始知前此厚誣者之不確、聞偉君笑謂予曰、君在西安時、不聞趙廳長守鈺之語乎、縣長在城墻上坐堂時、無意中將騖木一拍、跑出幾只狼來、斯非形容甘泉之冷落無人跡乎、今則何如、同時予等在鄜縣時、每詢及甘泉之情形、輒摇手曰一不興、不興」、至是足證耳之所聞不如目所見之確也、是日正逢集期（每月廕曆初五十五二十五三日爲各方商品齊集市街、舉行貿易之期）、路上行人攘攘熈熈、頗形熱鬧、劣貨尚未絕跡、獅牌牙粉及蹺鬍子敵人商標之仁丹、隨處可見、惟經濟上無重大數字、該縣人士在我東北尚未收回前、對此亦應加以注意、</p>
<p>甘泉縣之泉水、本甚著名、聞清時西太后之飲料、嘗取給於此、因以著名、惟據當地人士言、該泉今已涸、或云仍在城外數里、言者已不能道其詳、無從探考、目下甘泉之水、污濁異常、與命名相去遠矣、</p>
<p>地下都有石油</p>
<p>原甘泉之水之所以不甚清潔者、其最大原因、則以地下藴藏巨量石油之故、甘之人現不特洛水含有鹼性、不能作爲良好之飲料、卽其井水、平常者水面浮油花、而甚者則油臭觸鼻、惡劣異常、絕對不能以爲烹茶煮飯之用、據劉縣長云、甘泉附近之水、幾皆如此、而以南部者爲尤甚足證地下均有石油之藴藏也、石油而外、煤鐵等鑛、亦甚著名、鐵鑛在縣西六十里之府村鎭寺溝地方、質甚佳民國元年、當地居民曾集資以土法開採、以經濟不足及受交通阻梗影響、停止進行、煤鑛則在縣南十五里地之坡底村、及城裏八里之窰店子溝等處、質尚不惡、同洽兵燹後、曾停辦一次、再辦時以受地震及水災影響、無以繼續、今已成爲廢鑛、除平常農産外、産甘草及芮紅等藥材、爲量頗巨、以無統計從略、</p>
<p>縣城在山麓、爲一周圍六里餘之三角形、全縣面積、據云爲一萬三各方里、人口二萬餘名、田賦歲收約二千元、城内有居民百餘户、約五六百人以教育言、有高級小學二所、女子初級小學二所、男子初級小學十八所、學生總約五六百人、教育經費年約五千餘、均得之於地方公欵中、教員薪水、初級小學全年祇五十元、高級小學全年約一百五十元、課程依照教部所頒暫行標準辦理、高級小學中、不設英文課、</p>
<p>調查至此、予等應向讀者聲明數點、物價方面、當地商民多不肯以實數相告、往往一種物價詢問多方、比較之而後得、不得以爲完全準確、此其一、我國全國缺乏統計、内地尤甚、一地之人口面積以及鑛産或其他之數字等、往往各異其說、考察結果之所得、只能認爲大概情形、不能認爲絕對的無差誤、此其二、此次考察、爲時僅三十日、共歷十八處、所用於途行之　間幾及三分之二、匆匆促促、幾似走馬看花、蓋詳細之考察、雖一地之探討、數閱月之時間不爲多、今雖對所携各地鑛産標本、一俟返西安等處後、或須加以化騐等等工作、而時間仍嫌不足、此其三、是晚一部分團員、仍爲跳虱所擾、轉輾不能成寐、翌晨、（二十七日）已决定開拔至　施（舊延安府）、該處擬停駐一二日、以探察鑛區、并俟黄君伯達之至、蓋黄君單身自宜君赴衣食村等處鑛區考察、迄今尚未趕上、音訊無從傳遞、予等頗以爲念也、（八月二十七日晨自甘泉寄）</p>

<p>山雨旣來、衣履盡濕、此吾人於二十七日晨七時半去甘泉而赴膚施之情形也、方予等之各自本鄕西行也、咸以爲此地少雨、陜地且蒙以旱著當不致有滂沱大雨之可能、以故携雨衣或雨傘者爲數頗少、雨旣沛然至、衆以歡送者尚立道旁、若卽入夾窩中避雨、於禮頗不合、乃不得不冒雨徐來、俟歡送者散去後、方各就道、而吾人已吃足雨之苦矣、十時半過勞山、十一時雨勢更大、路濘滑不堪、武裝同志及脚夫等步行其間、其苦萬狀、十一時半抵九燕山、羣下乘休息、乘間進茶點以果腹、十二時全體復前進、而雨仍不止、如此具有恒性之雨、在北方實爲罕見、</p>
<p>是日趣事甚多、當全體抵勞山前　忽有持步槍而藍服者、自道旁林中趨出、步哨疑爲匪至、急放槍一響、持槍者大驚、急將槍放下、并聲明爲保衛團團員、軍士恨其不應如此、將其繳械、此一事也、中央大學徐乃仁君、凡事謹愼、見人吃西瓜、徐君慮其與虎疫有關也、則必向吃者曰、當心當心、餐時見蠅羣之將飛來也、則以手揮之曰、當心當心、且對無論任何團員、均甚當心、於是衆人乃呼之曰「UncleHsu徐爺叔、」是日下午五時將抵膚施時、爺叔所乘之夾窩、忽斷其紫杆之繩、爺叔出不意、自夾窩中弊了一交、休息後、爺叔追述往事、並蹙額言曰、危險危險、衆人見、爺叔姿勢之頗滑稽、也不禁爲之捧腹、此又一事也、</p>
<p>五時半、予等在夾窩中、已能望見膚施之塔、移時、縣長石君公安局長李君乘騎馳騁來迎矣、膚施卽昔之延安府、規模頗大、商業亦較前數縣爲盛、第予等入城、以道途困乏、且全體將在膚施工作二日、時間頗有餘豫、故未卽加以調查、</p>

<p>丨孫麟方得初級單打决賽權丨</p>
<p>上海一年一度之羅伯杯國際雙打網球錦標比賽、今届又至最後一關、得决賽權爲中華對英國、已定今日下午四時在霞飛路法商總總内草地網球會塲决賽、中華選手爲林寳華邱飛海英國爲德孚與惠特、兩組人才平均、技術超衆、今日之戰、可謂今年網球季中最劇烈之比賽、英國組實力殊强、林邱務須謹愼作戰、冀保持錦標、完成連執三年之榮譽、</p>
<p>又今日法商總會二時三刻起之第一塲比賽、爲初級網球單打决賽、孫麟方對今日上午複賽之海列斯與遜那之勝者、</p>
<p>草地會初級網球單打、昨日孫麟方對福勃斯在中華網球場舉行複賽、孫之正反手抽球、頗有把握、且時用遠近左右之球以制勝福勃斯常用劈球、作戰極鎭靜二人均謹愼非凡、一球之勝負、每來往至多次始判、故三盤結果、費時一點半鐘、孫以六比四、六比二、六比四勝孫遂得决賽權、</p>

<p>邱飛海鄭兆佳德孚</p>
<p>昨日皆奪得複賽權</p>
<p>丨複賽邱飛海遇林寳華丨</p>
<p>草地網球會之高級單打賽、昨日半複賽完畢、邱飛海·德孚·鄭兆佳及林寳華四人得複賽權、複賽中邱將遇林、鄭則逢德孚、昨日邱飛海勝江道章、及德孚勝卡那凡洛兩組、在法商總會舉行、鄭兆佳勝余田光在中華網球塲、</p>
<p>邱飛海勝江道章</p>
<p>丨六比一、六比一、六比一、</p>
<p>邱江兩人首先於二時三刻作戰、因勝負之形勢縣殊、故撃來極隨便之至、三盤之中僅二三局有數次可觀之射撃、二人均在底線作平抽、邱亦難得有深得角底之猛射、第一盤江於第五局、回邱之力抽獲一局、第二盤江第三局獲一局、第三盤則第二局勝一局、</p>
<p>德孚勝卡那凡落</p>
<p>丨六比二六比一、四比六、六比四、</p>
<p>德卡繼之登塲、德孚仍用大刀闊斧之一抽一殺之進攻、第一第二兩盤、勢如破竹、迨第三盤聰明之卡那凡洛似已窺破德之弱點、連向德之反手進攻、而以時近時遠、左右同攻、同網攔殺、德孚疲於奔走、而力漸不濟、德孚雖以四比三佔先、仍爲卡連勝三局、奪回一盤、第四盤卡曾二比一居先、其後三三四四平手、第九局卡以三比一佔勝、大有再勝此盤之勢、卒爲德反勝而勝全局、德之獲勝、頗費氣力、而自殺之球之多、反手毫無把握、向左右邊攻射者多出界、較上年退步已多、故鄭兆佳大有獲勝可能、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳勝余田光</p>
<p>鄭兆佳昨與余田光作戰於中華網球塲、二少年選手昨爲初次正式交手、余爲一九三零上海草地網球會之公開乙組冠軍、而鄭則爲有名之新進健將、今年技術、更有特殊進步、交綏之下、高下懸殊、鄭之力道硬勁、余則較爲軟弱、鄭之抽球、每使余不及奔跑、殊局勢鬆懈、精彩頗少、余每上網攔撃、亦有良好表演、第一盤鄭勝三局後、鄭發球、曾連勝三記、但仍歸失敗、余發球、力取一局、下局鄭以野球失敗、成四比二、鄭連加兩局、以六比二勝第一盤、第二盤余僅於第三局上以發球取得、餘均歸失敗、鄭又以六比一勝、稍事休息、換新球逐鹿、二人精神忽振、比賽頓覺激烈、局勢大爲緊張、但不久余又現軟弱之狀余得第三及第六局、鄭又以六比二勝、鄭乃入複賽中、其對手爲上届冠軍德孚、</p>

<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>在十餘年以前，記者受了五月九日二十一條的刺激，曾作「亡國奴日記」一卷（中華書局出版）將自已權充一個朝鮮式的亡國奴，和淚和墨的描寫我們中國被日本滅亡以後的慘狀。當時我在結尾說過這樣一句話，「願此理想永爲理想，」誰知去年九月十八夜，日本突然入寇東省，演成了一年來種種恐怖與悲哀的活劇。我十餘年前的理想，似乎漸漸地要現實了！</p>
<p>但我雖做過了理想的亡國奴，郤不願意做實的亡國奴。於是拔劍斫地，搔首問天，整日整夜的繞室徬徨，苦苦地想「我們應該怎樣救國？」叵耐救國有心，回天乏術，苦想了三日三夜，總也想不出一個有效的方案來。無可如何，只得借自由談篇幅，公開的徵求一下。旬日之間，居然接到了三百餘函之多，現在姑選其中切實可行的若干件，披露出來。願大家劍及屨及，急起直追，努力地共做這救國的大工作。</p>
<h3 id="c172">我們應該怎樣救國？ <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>

<p>丨求人不如求已丨</p>
<p>天下最靠得住的祇有一個我，求人憐惜，求人帮忙，結果只是自掘墳墓！</p>
<p>「不怕千條箭，只怕一條心」，我們應當自動地團結來，互相勉勵，互相刻苦，要知道「國家的骨子，就是公民集合力的倉庫」，</p>
<p>别以爲自已「人微言輕」，便不能救國，要知道一個盡職的小工，或許比一個睡在鋼絲床上喊抵抗的要人强得多，</p>
<p>我們要「遠處着眼，近處立脚」，認定一條途徑，大踏步的走去，總有一天丨總有那「以牙還牙，以血還血」的一天！</p>
<p>眼前救國唯一的對象，是增加富力和智力。學生罷課工人罷工，一則减少國家智慧力的來源，一則减少國家生産力的來源，都是要不得的！</p>
<p>我們要立誓終身不買賣仇貨，不與仇人發生任何職業上的合作關係，臨死，别忘記立遺囑給子孫！</p>
<p>我們應當積極地鍛鍊自已的身體，在平時這身體是做事的工具，到戰時就是殺敵的利器　　同情和援助，不是紙上和嘴上的空名詞，我們應當實切地救濟我們東省的「有血無鐵」的義勇軍！</p>

<p>（一）用土貨　甘地的赤身露體穿着印度土布，便是這種辦法。我們不必穿大英皮鞋，有的是土製的老布鞋子；我們不必喫美女牌冰淇淋，有的是燒滾的一杯白開水；我們不必穿國外來的什麽什麽紗，有的是中國的土布或絲綢；退三萬六千里講，把電燈線割去，點上一盞菜油燈，也並不是一件醜事！</p>
<p>（二）救國金　由民衆自動的捐輸，救濟國家眼前的缺陷，欵仍由民衆自已保存，他的用途由民衆恊同政府共同辦理，如擴充軍備，開闢工廠，開墾荒地，倡辦實業等。</p>
<p>（三）强制教育　調查全國的學齡兒童，强制送入學校；成人未曾受過教育的，當倡辦民衆夜校。學校經費及籌備，都應由民衆自動創辦和監督！</p>
<p>（四）徵兵制　全國民衆，當受相當年份的軍事訓練，使全國民衆都有軍事常識；未成年的，也當强迫受體育教育。使全國都是强壯的後備兵，祇有少數的正式軍隊。</p>
<h3 id="c174">兩「自」救國法 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣潔如</p>
<p>丨「自我」　「自此刻起」丨</p>
<p>救中國，先得使中國的經濟組織健全穩定！換一句說：就是一面要儘量生産，一面要竭力節費，丨丨這是救中國的對策；也應當是目前從事救國工作所確認的共同目標。　　要完成這目標，固然要全民族一齊用力，但所謂「民族力量」却是個人力量的集合體。國人第一毛病，是：責任别人救國而忘記自已！人人都不自盡力，民族的力量遂無由生；國也無從救！</p>
<p>其次，要完成這目標，固然要有長期間的努力，但「行遠自邇」，十年二十年是從一杪鐘一分鐘聯累而成。國人第二毛病，是：追懷過去希望未來而忽略現在，因循坐誤，國勢便日瀕危境而不可救！</p>
<p>所以今後救國工作欲有實效，國人必須戒除上面兩大毛病，在前邊所說的共同確認的目標下，每一個人「「自」我」的「自」此刻起」用力才行！</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>丨謹訂四項信條丨</p>
<p>處今日而猶談救國，救國呼聲乃僅出於極少數智識階級之口，而猶望其有切實辦法；涉筆及此，無限悲痛。此非好唱高調，或故作危論；蓋中國今日之局勢，居上位者自身旣不能團結，又不屑領導民衆；民衆因無堅强組織，乃徬徨莫知自救；遂成分崩離析之局。故今日救國第一要義，厥爲喚起民衆，整飭其陣線，堅强其組織，各盡各職，各竭各力，力戒私慾，浮燥·剛愎·苟惰諸惡習，然後事乃可爲。兹姑就人人可做之救國基本工作，謹訂四種信條，質之高明，以爲何如？</p>
<p>學生快快多讀書，</p>
<p>商人第一重廉恥；</p>
<p>農工各自盡其力；</p>
<p>全國一律戒奢侈。</p>
<p>吾人不計一切惡劣環境，不望政府之指導或扶助，不務高，不好大，但豎起脊梁各自努力基本工作。右述四種信條，均輕而易舉，人人可做而易收實效。如并此而不願做，不屑做；則一切俱爲空談，俱爲幻想，以後請勿再談救國！</p>
<h3 id="c176">人人做得到的救國方法 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 雙紅</p>
<p>丨救國先從人民自已救起丨</p>
<p>醒醒吧！救國救國，現在是再不可唱那紙上談兵的空論了！要救國，先要從人民自已救起啊！</p>
<p>（一）青年的學生們！快快努力的用工讀書罷！刻苦的研究學術罷！不要再演那驅逐和毆打校長的把戲了！</p>
<p>（二）神聖的工人們！專心的工作罷！替自已增加生産，就是替國家增加生産啊！不幸的工潮，不要再發生了！</p>
<p>（三）實業家和一般的商人們！擺正了良心，不要再私運劣貨來冒充國貨了！</p>
<p>（四）摩登的姑娘們！你們不要再把寳貴的光隂消費在塗口紅調脂粉的工夫上面了！多化些精神在有益的工作上面去罷！讀書的專心讀書，料理家政的專心家政，有職業的專心職業，　　（五）其他一切的人們！你們不必眞的要臥着薪，　着膽，當此國家社會經濟十分衰落的時代，大家「節儉救國」吧！假使人人能夠布衣粗食的節儉着，包管比口裏喊着「臥薪嘗瞻」來得有效。</p>
<p>以上的幾件事是人人做得到的，人人能决心自救，那末「國」也不救而自「救」了！</p>

<p>— 張潛</p>
<p>丨一共四個丨</p>
<p>第一，無論什麽事，不要抱着自私自利的觀念。「自私自利」的觀念，在社會上眞是流行得極廣。一切貪贜，舞弊，枉法，違職，莫不由「私」字出來。這種人那能救國。救國先要「没有自已」！</p>
<p>第二，簡單樸實勤苦耐勞的生活　現在的生活，眞把人過得越來越嬌，飯菜非好的不能下口，房屋非好的不願住，好之上還要好，考究一層還要考究，試問這種情形和中國的現狀合不合？這種人能不能談救國？他們和自私自利的人一般，要是得到位置，只是拚命自肥而已。</p>
<p>第三，不要服用外國貨　一切日用物品，仇貨固然絕對不買，就是任何外國貨，也要盡力不買，我們愛護國貨，便可以爲民族資本培養一些元氣，便可以少受一層帝國主義者的榨取。</p>
<p>第四，努力宣傳科學　中國事事吃虧，根本物質文明落後，尤其是科學，工業。現在國内新工業雖漸興起，但是在科學基礎毫無的中國，猶如沙上築塔，靠不大住，我們有知識的人一定要各人在社會上盡力宣傳使一般民衆都知道外面是科學的世界。都知道愛護科學，都知道尊重科學，父喻其子，兄告其弟，這種勢力廣植在民間，將來便有無數工程師出來，造成穩固的工業基礎，</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>刧後的Ｓ埠的街上，彩色的紅燈，商店裏吹着「孟姜女尋夫」調的招攬顧客的樂隊，無線電的歌唱，什麽都没有了。整日夜在那裏招摇過市的不是雙眼通紅，像發了瘋一樣的，Ｊ國海陸軍；便是穿着破碎不堪的西裝，驕傲得不知道世界上還有别的民族的Ｊ國浪人。他們丨從小孩子到老太婆，已把整個的Ｓ埠看做黄豆大的一粒了！月亮形的大旗，到處招展着。</p>
<p>三十二軍的後退，便使Ｊ國軍隊不費吹灰之力的佔領了Ｓ埠；數十萬市民，立刻陷入萬刼不復的亡國奴境界裏去了。裸體婦人的死屍，堆满了武日路上的一個大廟。槍聲隨時在路上響着。每一個中國人的生命，已像一顆石子一般的不值錢了。</p>
<p>這一夜黑雲籠罩在Ｓ埠的天上，大雨像倒瀉似的下着，整天在青雲裏耀武揚威的Ｊ國飛機，已躱得影跡全無了；街上站着的Ｊ國哨兵，齊躱在電桿木後發抖。</p>
<p>突然，機聲軋軋，半空中閃着幾十條白光，幾百磅重的炸彈，不斷地飛下來。</p>
<p>「轟：：轟：：」Ｊ國軍的飛機場毁了，司令部炸了，戰車庫也起火了！無數的棄甲丢盔的Ｊ國海陸軍，忘了命似的在大雨裏逃着，擠着，呌着。所謂皇軍的威武，是掃地無餘了！</p>
<p>接着，西北方面，響得跟普通砲火顯然有别的砲聲，連珠價地吼着！主要街道上到處有便衣隊Ｊ國軍隊浪人混戰着。手溜彈，機關槍，迫撃砲，越響越密，大火延長了七八里路。雨變了油，不但熄不滅火，反增加了烈熖。</p>
<p>天不曾明，西北方前線上的Ｊ國陸軍完全潰退下來了。突如其來的深黑色的怪飛機，成了行的在他們頭上擲下重量的炸彈來，把他們一隊一隊地毁滅，活埋，幾天前他們所施於中國軍隊的酷刑，今天臨到他們自已身上了！</p>
<p>馬淞口外，七浦江中，同時也衝來了幾百條鋼製的小汽船，發着極猛烈的砲火，分成幾隊，向停泊在那裡的Ｊ國軍艦進襲；靈活的鋼練，從小船上飛出來，勾住了軍艦上的船弦，便有許多背着正在發射的機關槍的勇士，打鋼練上爬到了軍艦上，爆炸力極强的手溜彈，就打他們手裡丢出來了。</p>
<p>這種奇異的戰術，立刻征服了幾千噸重的軍艦，海軍是解决了！到下午，一個有槍的Ｊ國人，都做了徒手的俘虜。幾百架純黑色的戰鬥機，在肅清了敵人的空軍之後，就在半天裡排列成四個大字，丨「中華萬歲。」</p>
<p>穿着黑色軍服，擎着黑旗的中華健兒，已逐走了敵人，把整個的Ｓ埠奪回來了！</p>
<p>這是經過十五年的訓練，從未參加内戰的黑旗軍的偉大的勝利。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fundamentally Denying the So-Called "Manchukuo" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Alas! Our more than 300,000 square li of northeastern territory has been tragically lost; our 30 million diligent and hardworking compatriots are suffering terribly. It has been a full year since this began. The puppet organization, manufactured by the Japanese through military threats and coercion, has been in existence for half a year since its establishment. All of our countrymen, witnessing this great change, are filled with indignation. The reason we have endured and bided our time, carefully considering our options, is that we hoped righteousness and humanity still held sway, and that international law and treaties would provide sufficient guarantees. We did not want to resort to violence against violence. We wanted to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute through peaceful means and eliminate the hidden dangers of a second world war. Unexpectedly, the Japanese have consistently chosen to be enemies of righteousness and international agreements. They have disregarded our country's painstaking efforts to preserve the overall situation and have instead intensified their actions, moving to further recognize their so-called "Manchukuo" and conclude treaties with it. If this is tolerable, what is not?</p>
<p>If the so-called "Manchukuo" arose from the spontaneous actions of the people of the Northeast and truly had the form of a state, Japan's desire to recognize it would be understandable. But now, Manchuria is territory seized by Japanese military invasion. The puppet Puyi and his ilk were brought to the stage by the Japanese as a mere puppet show. Moreover, all real power is in the hands of Japanese warlords, causing our northeastern compatriots to gnash their teeth in anger and embrace the determination to perish for their country. I ask, what country exists in our Northeast? To claim that there is a "Manchukuo" and to raise the question of recognition is a historical and unprecedented absurdity. The reason they insist on establishing the name of "Manchukuo" and recognizing it is simply to divide our territory and annex it for themselves. Uchida once stated, "Japan's plan to carve up Chinese territory must be completed. Even if China makes concessions to Japan within the scope of treaties, it cannot regain sovereignty over the three eastern provinces." The treaty that Japan intends to conclude with its so-called "Manchukuo" also includes provisions for Japan to station troops in Manchuria and assume responsibility for Manchuria's internal and external defense. From this, it can be seen that in the eyes of the Japanese, there is no such thing as "Manchukuo." The establishment of the so-called "Manchukuo" is merely a declaration of their determination to invade and to use it to cover up their future acts of aggression.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Luo, recognizing this, has long declared, "China absolutely cannot agree to any solution to the Northeast situation that takes as its premise the puppet organization created, maintained, and controlled by Japanese military force in the eastern provinces." The government fundamentally denies the existence of the puppet state. This can be seen here. According to Japanese telegrams, Ambassador Jiang visited Araki in Japan yesterday morning to exchange important opinions. Araki stated that the establishment of "Manchukuo" has been over half a year, and dwelling on the past is undesirable. Judging from this, Araki has not changed his policy of recognizing "Manchukuo." But I ask, if Japan does not change its policy of recognizing "Manchukuo," how can China agree to other solutions to the Northeast situation? Today, the people of the nation must unite and, on one hand, express to all countries of the world that the Chinese people fundamentally deny the "Manchukuo" that obstructs the peaceful resolution of the Northeast situation. If Japan recklessly recognizes the puppet "Manchukuo," it will be tantamount to destroying all guarantees of world peace. If unfortunate events occur in East Asia as a result, Japan should bear the responsibility. On the other hand, we should uphold the spirit of perseverance and vow to make all kinds of sacrifices, even at the cost of our lives, to serve as a backing for the government's implementation of the fundamental policy of resolving the Northeast situation.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to sources in diplomatic circles, Japan will formally recognize the puppet organization and announce its so-called Japan-Manchukuo Defense Treaty to the world. Our government has decided to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government on the day after receiving the formal report. As for the content of the protest, whether it will be based solely on historical and geographical reasons, as well as the language and customs of the residents, and various international conventions, declaring the integrity of our three northeastern provinces' territory and sovereignty, and whether it will involve the postal, telecommunications, customs, and judicial issues of the three northeastern provinces separately,</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei stated that among the three standing committee members of the Central Political Council, Jiang is at the front directing the suppression of bandits, Hu is in Hong Kong and does not hear about political affairs, and Wang himself is receiving medical treatment in Shanghai due to illness, which has caused the central political machinery to almost lose its effectiveness. The previous regular meeting was adjourned due to the lack of a chairman, which made him feel particularly uneasy. He also stated that the Central Political Council holds the center of political gravity and cannot be suspended for long, but it is also difficult in reality for one person to serve as the chairman on a permanent basis. In the past, when Jiang was the chairman of the Political Council and was away leading troops and unable to attend to his duties, he entrusted another member of the Central Committee to act as chairman as a temporary remedy. Therefore, today he telegraphed the central government, requesting that it follow the past example and recommend another member to temporarily substitute as chairman during his absence in Beijing for medical treatment, so that the promotion of central politics can be freed from obstruction.

<p>丨Observations of People in London丨</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: It is generally believed that the publication of Japan and the "Manchukuo (Pseudo) Country" and the Lytton Report are two important matters that will become crucial to the safety of the Far East. However, responsible British people are all eagerly awaiting the publication of reliable news about the contents of the report, and pointed out that some of the contents that have been leaked to the outside are incorrect. The Financial Times stated that the incompatibility between the Lytton Report and the Japan-Manchukuo agreement is clearly visible. The fundamental conflict between the two documents will inevitably cause deep and important opposition from the League of Nations on one side, Japan on one side, or both sides. Relations in the Pacific are almost in a stalemate. The appearance of the US fleet in the Pacific should not be overemphasized. However, the stimulation of nationalism in China and Japan is extremely profound and does not allow for easy compromises between the two sides. Will the stronger of the nationalisms prevail, or will the weaker prevail, or will it be decided in the crisis this autumn? Will Japan be forced to carry out or end its ambitious Northeast plan due to its difficult economic background? This is also a major event that must be decided this autumn.</p>

<p>Paraguayan Army Counterattacks Victoriously</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, 10th: Bolivian and Paraguayan troops have opened fire in the border forest area, with a long front line. The Paraguayan army claims to have captured the Bolivian army's Pokron fort. In the past 24 hours, aircraft and heavy artillery have participated in the battle around the fort. It is reported that there have been many casualties on both sides. The war began at dawn yesterday when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayan towns of Poso and Valencia from the Pokron fort, using artillery to bombard them. However, the Paraguayan army defended stubbornly and launched a profitable counterattack. The Paraguayan president said that the Paraguayan government has not received any documents from neutral countries, and it is very puzzling why the neutral countries in Washington are silent. This matter hinders Paraguay's relations with the League of Nations. Both sides are now accusing each other of undeclared war.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th: There has been little news recently about the situation of the undeclared war between Bolivia and Paraguay in South America. It is now learned that the war is in full swing. The two sides have been arguing for centuries over the forest area on the border, and have recently come into conflict. The Bolivian army captured several forts in early August, and is now attacking Paraguayan territory. Bolivia wants a way out to the sea. Neutral countries have advised it to use peaceful methods to achieve its goals, but mediation has been ineffective. Paraguay has very little military strength, but the people are eager for patriotism and deeply hate the enemy. Many have joined the military. At the same time, there are disturbances brewing elsewhere in South America. According to news from Buenos Aires, the previous rumors of a revolution in Brazil, which had been extinguished, have now been revived and are still very active. In addition to São Paulo, new revolutions have also occurred in three other provinces. The most serious is in the province of Para, where the rebels are very rampant.</p>

Mills said that the German government has never formally notified its intention to postpone repayment. It is impossible to know now whether the German government intends to repay or extend the term. It is estimated that the amount due from Germany on September 30 is 12,500,000 marks for the US military's stationing expenses and 20,400,000 marks for the compensation requested by the American people.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 9th: The German government has asked the United States to extend the 42 million marks due on September 30 for the expenses of the Allied occupation army in the Rhineland and other miscellaneous items for 18 months.

In addition to the principal, France must also pay the United States approximately 39 million US dollars before the end of this year. It is expected that France will pay interest and extend the payment of the principal.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: It was learned tonight that the British government has decided to repay the 2,500,000 francs raised by the French during the British financial panic in 1931 in full. This is enough to show the progress of the British financial situation. After this amount is repaid, it can be said that all the foreign debts borrowed by the United Kingdom during the period of national crisis have been repaid. However, the British Treasury still has a difficult hurdle to overcome, but it is generally believed that the authorities will be able to fulfill it. The authorities are now calculating that they still need 90,000,000 pounds to repay the balance of the 5% war bonds, because the bondholders all want cash and are unwilling to exchange for 3.5% new bonds. In addition, there are 150,000,000 pounds of treasury bills that must be repaid this autumn or exchanged for new bills.</p>

<p>Burning More Than Seventy Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: At the end of last month, the leaders of the righteous army, Wang Shengrong and Zhao Shulin, twice attacked Shenyang, shocking China and Japan. However, many of the reports in China proper still do not match the facts. A special letter was sent from Beiping to report the truth of the attack on Shenyang. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Before attacking Shenyang, the righteous army leaders Sheng Yu, Wang Dawei, Rong Zhaohua, Zhao Dianliang, etc. discussed the plan to attack Shenyang all day long. Finally, it was decided to start the attack after Mutō arrived in Shenyang, and it was agreed to act together at 10:00 p.m. on August 28. That night, Wang Dawei led more than two thousand righteous soldiers to take charge of the south side, Sheng Yu led more than one thousand righteous soldiers (including the broadsword team) to take charge of the west side, and Rong Zhaohua led six hundred people to take charge of the northeast side. At around 10:00, the south route sneaked in through the South Gate, the west route sneaked in through [omission], and the northeast route sneaked in through the Feng-Hu Station of the Great North Gate. At this time, the enemy's military police had not yet noticed. It happened that a certain Japanese consultant was riding in a yellow car to Feng-Hai Station, and met our army advancing on the northeast route. Our army suspected that the Japanese had noticed and were coming to attack. Our army immediately opened fire, (at this time it was not yet 10:00) immediately killing the three Japanese people in the same car, and continued to advance. At this time, the southwest routes heard the gunfire and rushed in from all directions. After a fierce battle between the northeast route and the Japanese puppet military police, in addition to killing and wounding more than 20 policemen, more than 10 Japanese people were killed (including several Japanese military officers), and more than 130 enemy military police guns were seized. Then they surrounded the radio station and destroyed its important parts. Finally, they attacked the Japanese station. After a fierce battle between the south route and the Japanese military police, more than 20 police guns were seized, and more than 10 Japanese soldiers and officers were killed and wounded. The weapons, clothing, hats, and command knives of the wounded and killed Japanese officers were also seized. Later, they joined other routes to the two major aircraft factories and burned all the aircraft (mostly old ones, about 70). After the burning, they also concentrated on the Japanese station for a general attack. At this time, on the west route, Sheng Yu, Zhao Dianliang, Li Juchuan, Lin Zisheng, etc. were carrying out guerrilla warfare against the Japanese station to contain the Japanese reinforcements, so that they would not dare to go elsewhere, and waited for all routes to arrive together to occupy the Japanese station in one fell swoop. However, at this time, the artillery fire from the Japanese station was very dense, and fires started everywhere. Our army was afraid that innocent civilians would be affected, so they retreated immediately. After the retreat, they rested for one day on the 29th. At 11:00 p.m. on the 30th, they attacked according to the original plan. When the struggle began, the Japanese were terrified, and the Japanese station was in a deadly hail of bullets. This night's hard battle is difficult to describe in detail. If there had been sufficient ammunition, machine guns, and heavy artillery, Shenyang could definitely have been captured. At the same time, Liaoyang, Fushun, Xinmin, Kaiyuan, and Dashiqiao could all respond. Then, how difficult would it be to recover the lost territory of the Northeast? It is hoped that our compatriots, gentlemen, and patriots will give considerable assistance. This would be the good fortune of the righteous army and the good fortune of the country. The Shenyang Righteous and Brave Army, Wang Shengrong and Zhao Shulin, along with thousands of strong soldiers, jointly announce (September 8).</p>
<h3 id="e78">Suppression Army's General Offensive on XInji and Honghu <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Recently, the military affairs of suppressing bandits have focused on eastern Hubei and central Hubei. The central and left routes have advanced simultaneously, with Xinji and Honghu as their destinations. Since the general offensive of the central route troops on the 15th of last month, they have successively captured Huang'an, Qiliping, Tuanshugang, and Bopihe, with irresistible force. The remaining bandits took Xinji as their refuge, and fled to that place one after another, building fortifications and attempting to resist stubbornly. The various armies then advanced on separate routes, and the air force assisted in bombing. The most bombs were dropped in Xinji and the Yuanqiang River to the north, Hujia Chong and Fan Jia River to the northeast, and the Huwan and Wangjiawan areas southwest of Bopihe, and the most bandits were killed. All of the bandits' grain platforms, fortresses, and power lines were destroyed. On the 8th, Commander Zhang Fang reported by telegram that the Red bandits were extremely panicked at the active offensive of our army. The only bandits who could fight were the pseudo-Red Fourth Army and the Twenty-fifth Army, claiming to be eighteen regiments, resisting east and west, but fleeing after a single battle, or using flags to confuse our army. According to Commander Chen Jicheng's telegram, according to the reports of the captured and escaped soldiers, many of the houses in Xinji were destroyed by our aircraft bombing, and the order was extremely chaotic. The pseudo-important institutions have been moved to other places, leaving only a small number of personnel and the pseudo-headquarters to command the bandits. The bandit area is lacking in food and bullets. Each bandit has at most one hundred bullets, or as few as ten or dozens of bullets. Their predicament can be imagined. Zhang Fang, Wei Li, and Chen Jicheng are all on the front line, and have set a deadline to recover the bandit nest in Xinji. It is heard that the bandits have a plan to abandon Xinji and flee back to their old nest in Jinjiazhai, on the border of Anhui. According to Liu Gangfu, the director of the 14th Army's resident office in Hankou, after Wei Junzhang Lihuang recovered Qiliping and Tuanshu, he led two tracking teams to pursue and attack, fighting fiercely on one side to prevent bandits from crossing, and on the other side to prevent the input of grain and weapons, and then using a large army to suppress them. Division Commander Zhang Zhenhan and others all went to the front line in person. He Chenjun, the commander of the left-wing army, and Xu Yuanquan, the deputy commander, also often went to the front line by plane to give instructions. In the past ten days, XIngouju and Zhoulaoju were recovered in one battle, and Qujiawan and Liujiaji were occupied in another. The bandit's barriers have gradually become owned by the national army. On the 8th, the national army also recovered Zhuhe, as well as Daishi and Yufengkou in Hubei. Only two mounds in Quanhu are still in the hands of the bandits. The lake has been blockaded for a long time, and food and rice are lacking. Many coerced bandits took the opportunity to surrender, and the total number has reached thousands. Those who are still in the bandit area, as soon as they see airplanes distributing leaflets, rush to pick them up to see if there are any words of coercion and non-treatment. The national army, because most of them are coerced people, cannot bear to kill them all. Personnel trained by the army divisions use propaganda methods to persuade them to return. It is heard that the Red bandits are not very afraid of the national army's attacks, but they are most afraid of using political power to disperse their masses. Therefore, there is a metaphor that leaflets are more powerful than artillery shells. Winning hearts is the most important thing in suppressing bandits today. Regarding the recent combat situation, Xu Yuanquan had a very detailed telegram on the 7th, which is recorded as follows: "After our army captured XIngouju, Yanglinguan, Zhouliuju, and cleared the surrounding remnants of bandits, we used the 41st and 48th Divisions to attack Fenyang, Liujiaji, Pijiatan, and Xiaoshakou, the bandit dens in various places, at the same time on the 7th at dawn, The bandits had defensive works in various places, which were unusually strong, and the dikes were broken in front of them, with widths of several feet, connecting the lake water. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers bravely waded and swam, regardless of their own safety, and finally defeated the bandits in various places on that day, killing more than 300 bandits on the spot, capturing more than 200 guns, and seizing a radio. A group of remnant bandits fled to Zhuhe, and the rest fled into the lake in small boats. After detailed search for several days, it was found that four pseudo-military hospitals, one general hospital of the Xiang-E-West Province, and one arsenal were searched in Eryudun, Erchouhe, Zhoujiawan, Nanheshi, and Dukou. Most of them were newly built buildings with complete equipment and large capacity. Except for the medical staff who escaped from the hospital, more than 3,000 wounded bandits were abandoned. Except for the important parts that had been moved into the lake from the arsenal, each piece of electrical equipment and a large net bed for manufacturing rifles were searched. The rest of the pseudo-institutions included the Provincial Military Commission, the General Labor Union, the Mutual Aid Association, the Second Branch of the Military Academy, the Management Office, the Ordnance Bureau, schools, libraries, clubs, stadiums, telephone networks, printing houses, etc., which have all been evacuated. Except for documents and articles that have been ordered to be collected and inspected, the abandoned houses and bulky items have been burned to avoid being left for bandit use. Five hundred hostages from Tianqian, Mianying, Jinghan, and Chuan were found in the prisons in various places, and they have all been released and given money to return to their hometowns. Now that the bandit area has been recovered, the aftermath is being dealt with, and the troops are prepared to continue to clear the bandit dens in the lake in order to completely eradicate and fundamentally eliminate them. I send this telegram, Xu Yuanquan Yangxi Xingshen Yin" (September 9).</p>
<h3 id="e79">Han Fuqu's Statement on the Zhang Case <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Party Department Asks the Central Government to Pardon Zheng Jicheng</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zheng Jicheng, who assassinated Zhang Zongchang, is currently being held in the military court. According to the statement of Han Fuqu, the chairman of the provincial government, regarding this case, the provincial government has received many documents from the families of the victims in recent days, all requesting the provincial government to forward them to the central government for a pardon for Zheng Jicheng. However, the provincial government feels that it has no authority to deal with this matter. Director Zhang of Beiping sent a letter to me, asking about the course of the case, and I have already replied. Mr. Wan (Fulin) also sent a telegram (stating that this case was unexpected and a pity, etc., and the statement of returning to legal resolution must be shown by a telegram from the central government, and the provincial government can hand over this case to the court for handling only if Zhang's family sues. Now the central government has only replied with a "understood" to the provincial government's report telegram, and Zhang's family has not sued, so as of today, Zhang Jicheng has not been sent to the court, and is still being detained in the military court. My personal feeling is that if a central figure comes to Jinan, the local government should have the responsibility to guarantee him. However, Zhang Zongchang was originally a civilian, and since he came to Jinan, the local government wanted to [omission], but it was difficult to [omission] the name, etc. Zhang Lucun, the standing committee member of the Provincial Party Department, also made a statement, stating that the party departments in various places have been sending telegrams like snowflakes in recent days, and the representatives of the families who were brutally harmed by Zhang Zongchang have also sent documents to the Provincial Party Department, all requesting a pardon for Zheng Jicheng. The issue was brought up for discussion at today's routine meeting of the Provincial Party Department, and the resolution was roughly as follows: "After investigation, the deceased Zhang Zongchang was a traitor who sold out the country and harmed the people during his lifetime, and harmed comrades of this party. He should have been punished by the law of the country long ago. However, he could not be arrested, which caused him to be punished for a long time. This time, Zheng Jicheng assassinated him, which is no different from acting on behalf of the law of the country. The people are happy. We should send a telegram to the central government to forward to the national government to issue a clear order to pardon Zheng Jicheng for no crime, and trace the crimes of the traitor Zhang, and announce it to China and foreign countries to uphold justice and discipline." It is also heard that the Provincial Party Department will compile documents from all parties and forward them to the central government together. During the two years of the Republic of China, many people were killed by Zhang, since Du Shanmin, the wife of Du Huayu, and others initiated the joint petition of the families of the victims and the victims of the May 3rd Incident to support Zheng, many people have joined. The families of the victims will have a large-scale movement to support Zheng, and request the provincial government and the Party Department to forward the request to the central government in order to pardon Zheng.

<h3 id="e80">Recent Situation of Banditry in Jiaodong <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the beginning of autumn in the Jiaodong area, the green gauze tent has risen, and banditry has become rampant. Kidnappings and robberies are heard every day, and even arson and massacres have turned villages into ruins. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. The banditry in various counties is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhucheng: Youjiguan Village, fifty miles away from the city in the western township of the county, was suddenly attacked by more than 200 bandits from Ju County at about 8:00 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, with complete firearms. They sneaked in from the northwest corner and attacked the village. The village originally had a militia for defense, but because the incident was sudden, it was cut off by the bandits. Some retreated to the southeast corner of the village, and those who did not have time to retreat defended themselves with the house walls and fought against the bandits. The bandits searched and killed at will, and many farmers who could not hide were brutally harmed. The bandit leader, angered by the militia's resistance, ordered arson. For a time, the fire shone into the sky, visible from more than ten miles away. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls, and the villagers cried out in misery, reaching for several miles. The Zhigou militia, ten miles away from the village, rushed to help after hearing the alarm, but was also defeated by the bandits due to their small numbers. At 4:00 p.m. the next day, the garrison in the city rushed to the rescue and opened fire with the bandits three miles away from the village. The fierce battle shifted for a while, but it was still ineffective. Fortunately, more than 30 Zhigou militiamen arrived to help in the battle, attacking from both sides. At 6:00 p.m., they counterattacked into the village and finally repelled the bandits who had been entrenched in the village for a day and a night. After the incident, the investigation revealed that more than 80 villagers were killed or injured, mostly elderly, women, and children who could not escape. The strong men who died were the militiamen who resisted the bandits with guns. More than 200 houses were burned, and property losses amounted to more than 30,000 yuan, which is a tragic disaster that Zhucheng has never seen before.</p>
<p>Rizhao: The county's mountains are rugged and have always been a place where bandits come and go. At the end of last month, more than 200 bandits suddenly came to the vicinity of Yougushan in the southwest township of the county. That night, they moved to Suoluoshu Village. The villagers fled in panic upon hearing the news. Those who could not escape were captured by the bandits. The bandits occupied the village for three days, and all the grain, grass, property, cattle, donkeys, chickens, and ducks were looted. Doors, windows, and sundries were all broken with axes to cook rice. The crops in the fields were also mostly eaten and trampled clean by the bandits' mules and horses. When leaving, they also took away more than 40 male and female hostages, passing through Shuichegou and Hezhuang to Zhulou. Shangyuan and Nanjiezhuang were also burned by the bandits one after another. The villages were already very poor, but now they have suddenly suffered this catastrophe, which is truly lamentable. As for the case of kidnapping, it is everywhere in the county, so the villagers are startled several times a night and dare not stay in peace.</p>
<p>Gaomi: A large number of bandits were also found near the border between Gaomi and Changi recently, kidnapping everywhere. Rong Guangxing, the brigade commander of the 87th Brigade stationed in Jiaoxian, sent Battalion Commander Jin to lead a battalion of soldiers to Gaomi to supervise the suppression. They chased to a village in Changi County and encountered the bandits. The two sides opened fire and fought fiercely for several hours, killing 47 bandits on the spot, capturing 14 alive, rescuing more than 20 hostages, and obtaining a dozen guns. More than a dozen soldiers were also injured. It is heard that after Brigade Commander Rong slightly interrogated the bandits, he sent troops to escort them to Jinan for punishment according to law.

<h3 id="e81">Legislative Yuan Revises the Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Central Political and Legal Conference previously proposed by Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, to amend the Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes and restore compulsory arbitration, or to allow Shanghai to formulate separate laws and regulations and adopt compulsory arbitration (Wu's original proposal was published in this newspaper on August 8). It was decided to restore the compulsory arbitration method and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The 196th meeting of the Legislative Yuan decided to submit it to the Labor Law Drafting Committee for review. The 199th meeting then presented a report which, after deliberation, was submitted to the Labor Law Drafting Committee to be reviewed jointly with the Economic Committee and the Military Committee. After receiving the order, the committee held a joint meeting on September 2 and sent letters to various ministries, including the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Political Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways, as well as the Construction Committee, the Nanjing Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting each to send representatives to attend the meeting and state their opinions. It was decided to amend the texts of Articles 4, 15, 16, 20, and 44, and also to amend Article 23 of the Trade Union Law, which has an additive relationship with compulsory arbitration. It was submitted to the 201st General Assembly of the Legislative Yuan on September 10 and passed with amendments. The amended version is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Amended Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes Chapter 1 General Provisions (Article 1) This law applies when a dispute arises between an employer and a labor group, or 15 or more workers, regarding the maintenance or change of labor conditions. (Article 2) The administrative authority responsible for this law, unless otherwise specified, is the municipal government in the city and the county government in the county. The competent authority for a special industry is its administrative office. (Article 3) When a labor-capital dispute occurs, the administrative authority should convene a mediation committee to mediate upon the request of one or both parties to the dispute. If the administrative authority believes that there is a need for mediation, it should do the same even without the request of the parties. When mediation is successful, it is regarded as a contract between the parties to the dispute. If one of the parties is a trade union, it is regarded as a collective agreement between the parties. (Article 4) For labor-capital disputes in the following industries, if the matter is mediated without results, it should be submitted to the arbitration committee for arbitration: (1) Water, electricity, or gas industries for public needs; (2) Postal, telegraph, telephone, railway, tramway, shipping, and public automobile industries for public use. (Article 5) For labor-capital disputes other than those in the previous article, if mediation fails, it should be submitted to the arbitration committee for arbitration upon the request of both parties to the dispute. However, if the administrative authority believes that the dispute is of great importance and has lasted for more than one month without resolution, and deems it necessary to submit it to arbitration, it may submit the dispute to the arbitration committee for arbitration even without the request of the parties. (Article 6) Labor-capital disputes may not be submitted to arbitration without mediation procedures, unless both parties to the dispute request direct arbitration. (Article 7) The parties to the dispute may not appeal the decision of the arbitration committee. The decision in the preceding paragraph is regarded as a contract between the parties to the dispute. If one of the parties is a trade union, it is regarded as a collective agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 Agencies for Handling Labor-Capital Disputes Section 1 Mediation Agency (Article 8) Mediation of labor-capital disputes is handled by the mediation committee. (Article 9) The mediation committee consists of five or seven members, organized by the following representatives: (1) One or three representatives appointed by the administrative authority; (2) Two representatives appointed by each party to the dispute. The representatives in the first item of the preceding paragraph are not limited to the staff of the administrative authority. (Article 10) When a labor-capital dispute should be submitted to mediation in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 1, the parties to the dispute should each select or appoint a representative and report the representative's name and address within three days after receiving the notice from the administrative authority. The administrative authority may extend the time limit in the preceding paragraph as appropriate when it deems necessary. If the representative's name and address are not reported within the time limit, the administrative authority may designate them ex officio. (Article 11) After the selection of members of the mediation committee is determined, the administrative authority should convene a meeting as soon as possible, and the representative appointed by the administrative authority should serve as the chairman. However, the mediation committee stipulated in Article 13, paragraph 3, should have a representative appointed by the Ministry of Industry as the chairman. If the mediation committee has convened a meeting, but the members refuse to attend, causing the mediation to fail, it is deemed that the mediation has failed. (Article 12) The chairman of the mediation committee may transfer staff from the administrative authority or the local court in the area to handle records, filing, drafting, and all other general affairs. (Article 13) If there are two or more administrative authorities in charge of the same labor-capital dispute, and each administrative authority is in the same province, the administrative authority in the first item of paragraph 1 of Article 9 is designated by the provincial government. When necessary, the representatives in the first item of paragraph 1 of Article 9 may also be designated by the provincial government. If the same labor-capital dispute is not in the same province, the administrative authority in the first item of paragraph 1 of Article 9 is designated by the Ministry of Industry. If the Ministry of Industry deems it necessary, the representatives in the first item of paragraph 1 of Article 9 may be designated by the ministry. In the preceding two cases, for state-owned enterprises, the designation or appointment is made by its competent authority. Section 2 Arbitration Agency (Article 14) Arbitration of labor-capital disputes is handled by the arbitration committee. (Article 15) The arbitration committee consists of five members, organized by the following personnel: (1) One representative appointed by the administrative authority; (2) One representative appointed by the provincial party headquarters or the local municipal or county party headquarters; (3) One representative appointed by the local court; (4) One representative each from the labor and capital sides who have no direct stake in the dispute. (Article 16) Every two years, the provincial government or the municipal government not under the province should order labor groups and employer groups within its jurisdiction to nominate 24 to 48 persons who are qualified to be arbitration committee members, list their names, and submit them for approval and then report them to the Ministry of Industry for record. Every two years, the Ministry of Industry should order labor groups in state-owned enterprises and separately order the direct administrative organs of each enterprise to nominate 24 to 48 persons who are qualified to be arbitration committee members, list their names, and submit them for record. In the event of an arbitration, the representatives in the fourth item of the preceding article should be designated by the administrative authority from the lists in the preceding two items who have no direct stake in the dispute. The methods for nominating arbitration committee members in the first and second items are determined by the Ministry of Industry. (Article 17) Anyone who has served as a member of the mediation committee may not be a member of the arbitration committee for the same event. (Article 18) The arbitration committee is convened by the administrative authority, and the representative of the convening agency serves as the chairman. However, the arbitration committee stipulated in Article 20 should have a representative appointed by the Ministry of Industry as the chairman. (Article 19) The chairman of the arbitration committee may transfer staff from its affiliated agency or the local court in the area to handle records, filing, drafting, and all other general affairs. (Article 20) For the same labor-capital dispute, if its scope is not limited to one province, except for state-owned enterprises, the representatives in the first item of Article 15 are designated by the Ministry of Industry, and the representatives in the fourth item are designated by the Ministry of Industry from the list of arbitration committee members in the relevant provinces.

<h3 id="e82">Hangzhou Airplane Crash Account <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: At 9:40 AM on the 9th, the Aviation School of the Military and Political Affairs Department in Jianqiao, Hangzhou, dispatched two training planes, numbers 8 and 5, for two instructors to practice formation flying. Instructor Shi Manniu was in plane number 8, along with Chen Shenfu, the eldest son of the martyr Chen Yingshi (recommended by Chairman Chiang to the school for a make-up exam before enrollment). Instructor Zhang Guodong piloted plane number 5, accompanied by Kang Taihong, a technician from the school. They circled the city for forty minutes before returning to the airfield. Upon returning, the upper and lower wings of the two planes collided, and they crashed simultaneously. Plane number 8 was completely shattered. Instructor Shi Manniu's brains were splattered, and his back was broken. Chen Shenfu had a swelling of three or four inches on his left forehead, a high purple swelling on his chest, and his right arm and left leg were both fractured with skin still attached. His body was riddled with fragments from the shattered plane, and he died instantly. Plane number 5 only suffered damage to its wings and tail, with the fuselage remaining intact. Zhang and Kang suffered minor injuries. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident: Aviation instructor Zhang Guodong is recuperating at Guangji Hospital due to injuries. Zhang is from Jing County, Hebei Province, and is 39 years old. Zhang has been an instructor since the aviation school was first established. According to Zhang, the aviation school has not yet officially opened, so the instructors practice on their own daily. Yesterday, Instructor Shi took Chen Shenfu in plane number 8, and I took Mr.</p>
<p>Kang in plane number 5. At that time, we were practicing formation flying. My plane was on the upper left, and Shi's plane was on the lower right. When returning to the airfield, plane number 8 was jolted by an air current and suddenly rushed up towards plane number 5. There was a loud explosion, and Shi's plane crashed straight down. Although the wing of plane number 5 was damaged and the engine was also broken, fortunately, with the help of the wind, it descended slowly, and I was spared from death. I only suffered minor injuries to my left finger, right arm, and waist, with slight skin abrasions. Technician Kang also suffered skin injuries in several places.</p>
<p>Shi and Chen's Demise: Instructor Shi Manniu was 32 years old, from Jingzhou, Hubei Province, and had served in the aviation field for a long time. During the Northern Expedition, he repeatedly performed meritorious deeds in the Battle of Longtan. His wife is also in her thirties and has three children: the eldest is eight years old, named Xinman, and is already studying at Qiushi English School; the second is four years old, and the youngest is only two years old. Mrs. Shi is currently eight months pregnant. Shi's body was placed in a coffin last night and temporarily moved to the Caishen Temple in Jianqiao this morning (the 10th). It is reported that Shi also has an elderly mother in her sixties, and an elder brother named Zifeng, who works on the Longhai Railway, both currently in Zhengzhou, Henan. Shi's wife has already telegraphed her brother to report the tragic news of Shi's death. Chen Shenfu was 20 years old, his mother is still alive, and he has a younger brother named Zuhe. Chen graduated from the high school department of Zhijiang University this summer and applied to the aviation school a few days ago. He happened to be ill, and then received a telegram from Chairman Chiang on the 6th to retake the exam. Principal Mao did not allow him to fly for training because he had not undergone a physical examination. The day before yesterday, Instructor Shi was practicing flying, and Chen, being acquainted with Shi, insisted on flying with him. Shi agreed, but unexpectedly, this led to his death. After Chen Shenfu's death, the aviation school immediately telegraphed Chairman Chiang, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, and Chen Quanshi, Chen's uncle from his ancestral home of Wuxing. Quanshi received the news and rushed to Hangzhou that night. The Guofu brothers came to Hangzhou with Yingshi's wife at 1:45 PM on the 10th. After arriving at the station, they went to Zhu Mingtao's residence in Kui Lane with Mao Bangchu and others to discuss the funeral arrangements for his younger brother. Then, they went to Jianqiao together. In the evening, they placed his younger brother in a coffin so that he could be transported back to his hometown for burial. Aviation School Memorial Service: Aviation School Principal Mao Bangchu said that the airplane accident yesterday is viewed as shocking by outsiders, but in the aviation world, it is very common. Since the success of the airplane in 1903, accidents, both direct and indirect, in the aviation industry of advanced countries have been good materials for our research. Moreover, our country is just beginning to engage in the aviation industry, so we should not be discouraged by this accident. Rather, we should use the accident to gain more experience. The aviation industry of the world today has sacrificed countless lives. Mao also said that at 9:30 AM on the 10th, the aviation school had already held a simple ceremony to mourn Shi and Chen. Once the school's facilities and layout are in order, a grand memorial service will be held. (10th)</p>

<p>Trembling with Fear at the Nose of Yama</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th, our army was about to leave Luochuan, and everyone felt uneasy in their hearts, as if a great disaster was about to befall them. Having previewed the itinerary, we knew that we would soon encounter the "Nose of Yama," the Jiudaoshou Mountain (mountain name). The difficulty of the road was evident from its name. At that time, the group leader, Mr. Hu, was also quite worried about the unusual dangers of this trip. When he inquired about the possibility of bypassing the mountain, the locals replied with "Leopard Head Slope." In fact, the "Nose of Yama" was the name used by porters, while "Leopard Head Slope" was the name used by the local people. Although the names were different, they referred to the same place. When we heard Mr. Hu's report that we could bypass the "Nose of Yama" during breakfast at 6:30 AM, we were all overjoyed. At 7:00 AM, everything was ready, and we set off. I and Mr. Ou and five others rode ahead. At first, the road was flat and easy to travel, and we did not feel any hardship. An hour later, the so-called "Nose of Yama, Jiudaoshou Mountain" arrived. At first, the mountain road sloped downwards, almost like a vertical wall, appearing and reappearing in an endless series of switchbacks, causing the riders to tremble with fear. After one mountain had been crossed, and a small stream forded, there was an even larger mountain blocking the way ahead. We urged our horses straight upwards, and the higher we climbed, the less steep the slope became. Before we reached the mountainside, all five horses were already panting heavily. Looking up at the summit, we heard voices all around, as if those who sought to take advantage of others' peril to feast on them. At this point, we could only be extremely careful and urge our horses upwards. By the time we reached the flat ground at the summit, both men and horses were drenched in sweat. At 10:30 AM, we crossed the Jiezhi River and arrived at Jiezhi River Town. There were only a few residents in the town, and it was very desolate. The river was narrow and swift. I and Mr. Ou threw large stones into the middle of the stream to create stepping stones for those who followed, so that they would not have to wade barefoot. Half an hour later, the entire group gradually arrived. Everyone ate cold, filling-less steamed buns beside the stone table to appease their hunger, which was quite a unique experience.</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM, we whipped our horses again and set off. On the way, we talked about Liu Zhengheng, the magistrate of Luochuan County, who had graduated from Peking University, possessed considerable talent, and whose ambition extended beyond the county. An hour later, we thought that it was only 45 li from Jiezhi River to Fu County. Considering the time, we expected to arrive in Fu County for rest around 3:30 PM. Unexpectedly, after one mountain was crossed, another appeared. Climbing mountains and crossing ridges was no less difficult than the "Nose of Yama." Soon, we were traveling along a small path on the side of the mountain, with loose, scattered stones that made it easy for the horses to stumble. Looking down, there were jagged rocks and precipitous cliffs. The murmuring sound of the Luo River seemed to warn the travelers to proceed with caution. Around 4:30 PM, we finally arrived in Fu County, where Magistrate Jia Keqin and others were waiting by the Luo River to greet us. After we reached the other shore, we entered the city to rest. Mr. Jia and others went to the main road to welcome the members of the group who were riding in litters. Because the journey was arduous, they arrived in a continuous stream until dusk. That evening, everyone felt extremely exhausted, having traveled at least a hundred li or more. Six or seven out of ten went to bed and snored after dinner, unlike their previous energetic selves.</p>
<p>Although Fu County has mineral resources, most of them are undeveloped. In the short and hurried time available, it was difficult to search for and investigate materials. Therefore, we decided to leave Fu County for Ganquan the next morning (the 26th). We heard that the road was very flat, unlike the soul-stirring journey in Luochuan and Fu County.</p>
<p>Never Knowing the Taste of Fish in Their Lives</p>
<p>On the evening of the 25th, Magistrate Jia told me that there were no fish in Fu County, and the residents hardly knew the taste of fish in their lives. Even in places that were farther away, where a small amount of fish was obtained, the length was no more than two or three inches. The residents were even less familiar with how to cook and eat fish. Therefore, the taste was not very palatable, and the fish bones often pierced the throats of the people of Fu. Some people of Fu were even afraid of eating fish. Other situations are as follows: (A) Mineral Products (1) There are two coal mines: one is in Niuwu Town, forty li east of the city, with the best terrain. The coal is mostly lumpy, hard, and black, covering an area of about ten li, with reserves of about thirty trillion tons. The mine was once mined, producing more than five hundred tons per year. After the ninth year of the Republic of China, it was stopped due to local disturbances. The second is in Zhang Village, sixty li west of the city, and Liushi'an, seventy li west of the city, each covering an area of about twenty square li. Mining was stopped because the villagers were misled by feng shui beliefs. (2) Tongchuan Mine, twelve li north of the city, is located in Taihe Mountain. Because it has not yet been mined, the details are unknown. (3) The silver mine is located in Shichangzi, two hundred li northwest of the county. It is said that the composition is extremely good, with about seventy jin of silver in every hundred jin of ore. In the past, people from Sichuan went there to mine, but failed due to lack of scientific methods. (4) The iron mine is located in Jiangjiachuan Town, Xichuan, sixty li north of the county. The area also produces coal.</p>
<p>(B) Agricultural Products: The county has a total of 347,811 mu of land, of which 2,000 mu are planted with barley, with a total harvest of eighty shi; 5,000 mu with wheat, yielding four hundred shi; 2,000 mu with beans, yielding sixty shi; and millet, 5</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>thousands [misprinted number, probably meant to be fifty-seven thousand] , yielding 2,850 shi. Millet, 58,000 mu, yielding two 900 shi [inconsistent number, likely misprint. 2900 is likely]. Yellow beans, 3,000 mu, yielding one hundred and twenty shi; corn, 16,000 mu, yielding eight hundred shi; wheat, 7,000 mu, yielding two hundred and eighty shi; sorghum, 124,000 mu, yielding 3,820 shi. This is the general overview of the county's agricultural products. This year's land tax is estimated to be about 16,000 to 17,000 yuan. The people's livelihood is declining, especially among farmers. Many have abandoned their farmland and fled elsewhere.</p>
<p>(C) Others: The total population of the county is about 30,000, with about four hundred more men than women. Most of the residents from other provinces are from Sichuan and Shandong. Religions include Catholicism and Protestantism. There is a carpet weaving factory in the city, producing high-quality and inexpensive products. There are also many furs, such as sheep, fox, leopard, and wolf. Other situations are mostly the same as in nearby counties. There is a senior primary school in the city with about seventy or eighty students, a junior primary school for girls with about thirty students, and a junior primary school (for boys) with about one hundred and twenty students. In addition, there are sixteen other junior primary schools, located in various townships and towns. The annual education budget is about six to seven thousand yuan. Teachers' salaries are about ten to fifteen yuan per month. Tuition is free, but a sports fee and miscellaneous fee of fifty cents each are required per semester.</p>
<p>The Luo River flows down from Ganquan County, passing around the east gate of the city to the south. When the water is high, it floods without limit, encroaching on farmland and affecting agricultural production. When the water is shallow, the riverbed dries up, which is insufficient for agricultural irrigation. Therefore, the Luo River in Shaanxi has a hundred harms and not a single benefit, which is worse than the Yellow River. On the eleventh of this month, the Luo River suddenly rose, with a water depth of more than thirty feet, threatening to flood Fu County. The residents were extremely frightened. Fortunately, it receded after half a day, otherwise, the damage would have been unimaginable.</p>
<p>When we were walking in the mountains, coal blocks were readily available. Heaven has given us such rich resources, but the transportation is as difficult as the Shu Road, resulting in goods being abandoned on the ground without anyone caring. Even if people with ambition raise funds to excavate, the transportation costs are very high. For example, the price of coal in Xi'an sometimes reaches fifty or sixty yuan per ton, which is almost twice as high as in Shanghai. Once there is competition, there is absolutely no value in winning. In short, if Shaanxi and other parts of China remain so difficult to cross, with no improvement in transportation, then even if there is gold everywhere, it is no different from dirt. Everyone who has set foot in Shaanxi and witnessed the environment here has the same feeling. I hope the government will pay attention to it. (Sent from Fu County on the morning of August 26th)</p>
<p>Several Wolves Ran Out</p>
<p>On the 26th, because Jia, the Magistrate of Fu County, insisted on keeping a photograph as a souvenir, we departed one hour later than usual. After the whole group crossed the Luo River, we walked along the lower slopes of the mountain for about four or five li before getting on our litters or other mounts. Looking at the time, it was already past eight o'clock. The road was indeed very flat that day. Wildflowers bloomed on both sides, and the flowering buckwheat in the fields was in full bloom, stretching endlessly like a light red carpet covering a green field, which was exceptionally beautiful. The mountains were green, and the flowers were lovely. There was no azure water or green waves to embellish the scenery, but there was nothing else lacking.</p>
<p>This was the first time since we set off from Xi'an that the sky was clear all day. Around one o'clock in the afternoon, the entire group arrived at Daozuobao after traveling fifty li. The rain was as fine as silk, and the temperature dropped significantly. In the litters, the cold wind blew on our faces. We realized that the grass in Guanzhong was not yet lush, but the weather already had the feeling of a cool autumn in September. Long-distance travelers with only a few layers of thin clothing knew that it would not be enough to keep them warm, and they gradually added cotton clothes along the way.</p>
<p>After setting off from Daozuobao, the flat ground and mountain slopes alternated. There was only one place on the mountain slope where the road was only a foot wide, and it was quite dangerous overlooking the ground below. Those sitting in litters mostly got out and walked to avoid accidents. Only Mr. Hu Juewen was soundly sleeping and did not jump down. I was also exhausted from traveling long distances during the day, desperately rushing to get to our next location, exchanging opinions with local people in the evening, and investigating the general situation of the newly arrived places. I would then work at my desk by candlelight or kerosene lamp until two or three in the morning before going to bed. I slept late and woke up early, and my spirits were extremely low. So I stayed curled up in my litter, letting nature take its course. Fortunately, everything went smoothly and we did not suffer any hardship. Along the way, we saw exposed coal seams on the mountainsides everywhere. Unfortunately, the coal seams were very thin, only one or two inches thick. Whether it was worth mining was also a question.</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, we could see the city walls of Ganquan County in the distance. The county magistrate and others were already waiting outside the city to welcome us. Group leader Mr. Hu and others got out of their litters again, exchanged greetings with the welcomers, and expressed their gratitude. Then, we walked into Ganquan City. It was then that we realized that those who had slandered us before were inaccurate. Mr. Wei said to me with a smile, "Didn't you hear Director Zhao Shouyu's words in Xi'an? When the county magistrate was sitting in court on the city wall, he accidentally slapped the gavel, and several wolves ran out." Isn't that a description of Ganquan's desolation and lack of human presence? What is it like now? At the same time, when we were in Fu County, whenever we asked about the situation in Ganquan, they would shake their heads and say, "Not prosperous, not prosperous." So it is enough to prove that what we hear is not as accurate as what we see with our own eyes. That day happened to be a market day (the 5th, 15th, and 25th days of each lunar month are the days when goods from all directions gather in the market streets for trade). The roads were crowded and bustling, quite lively. Inferior goods were not yet extinct. Lion Brand toothpaste and Jintan with the logo of a mustached enemy were seen everywhere. However, there were no major economic figures. People in the county should also pay attention to this before our Northeast has been recovered.</p>
<p>The spring water in Ganquan County was very famous. It is said that the Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty used to get her drinking water from here, hence its fame. However, according to local people, the spring has now dried up. Others say that it is still a few miles outside the city, but the speakers could not describe it in detail, so there was no way to investigate. The water in Ganquan now is extremely turbid, far from its name.</p>
<p>There is Oil Underground</p>
<p>The biggest reason why the water in Ganquan is not very clean is that there are huge amounts of oil underground. Now, the people of Ganquan not only say that the Luo River contains alkali and cannot be used as good drinking water, but also that the well water has a layer of oil floating on the surface in normal cases, and in severe cases, it has a foul odor that is extremely unpleasant and absolutely cannot be used for making tea or cooking rice. According to County Magistrate Liu, the water near Ganquan is almost all like this, especially in the south, which proves that there is oil underground. In addition to oil, minerals such as coal and iron are also very famous. The iron mine is located in the Shigou area of Fucun Town, sixty li west of the county, and the quality is very good. In the first year of the Republic of China, local residents raised funds to mine it using indigenous methods, but the project was stopped due to insufficient funds and the impact of transportation barriers. The coal mine is located in Podi Village, fifteen li south of the county, and Yaodianzigou, eight li inside the city. The quality is not bad. After the Tongzhi Rebellion, it was suspended once. When it was reopened, it was affected by earthquakes and floods and could not continue. It has now become an abandoned mine. In addition to ordinary agricultural products, it produces medicinal materials such as licorice and Ruixian red, the amount of which is quite large, but there are no statistics available.</p>
<p>The county seat is located at the foot of a mountain, forming a triangle with a circumference of more than six li. The total area of the county is said to be 13,000 square li, with a population of more than 20,000. The annual revenue from land tax is about 2,000 yuan. There are more than one hundred households in the city, with about five or six hundred people. In terms of education, there are two senior primary schools, two junior primary schools for girls, and eighteen junior primary schools for boys, with a total of about five or six hundred students. The annual education expenditure is about five thousand yuan, all of which comes from local public funds. Teachers' salaries are only fifty yuan per year in junior primary schools and about one hundred and fifty yuan per year in senior primary schools. The curriculum is based on the temporary standards issued by the Ministry of Education. The senior primary schools do not have English classes.</p>
<p>At this point in the investigation, we should make a few points clear to the readers: In terms of prices, local merchants are mostly unwilling to tell the real numbers. Often, multiple inquiries are made for one type of price, and it is obtained after comparison, which cannot be considered completely accurate. This is one point. Our country lacks statistics, especially in the interior. The population area and mineral or other figures in one place are often different. The results of the investigation can only be considered a general situation and cannot be considered absolutely error-free. This is the second point. This investigation lasted only thirty days, covering a total of eighteen places. Almost two-thirds of the time was spent on the road. It was hurried and seemed like a fleeting glance. For a detailed investigation, even exploring one place would not be enough in months. Although we still need to perform chemical tests on the mineral samples we brought back after returning to Xi'an and other places, the time is still too short. This is the third point. That night, some members of the group were still plagued by fleas and could not sleep. The next morning (the 27th), we decided to depart for Fushi (the old Yan'an Prefecture), where we plan to stay for one or two days to explore the mining areas and wait for Mr. Huang Boda's arrival. Mr. Huang went alone to Yijun to investigate the mining areas in Yishicun and other places, but he has not caught up yet, and there is no way to transmit news. We are quite concerned.

<h3 id="e84">Uncle Kou Fell <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Mountain rain is coming, clothes and shoes are soaked. This was our situation when we left Ganquan at 7:30 AM on the 27th for Fushi. When each of us traveled west from our hometown, we all thought that there was little rain in this area, and Shaanxi was known for its drought, so there was no possibility of heavy rain. Therefore, very few people brought raincoats or umbrellas. When the rain came heavily, we felt that it was inappropriate to immediately enter the litters to avoid the rain while the welcomers were still standing by the roadside. Therefore, we had to brave the rain and walk slowly. After the welcomers dispersed, we each set off, and we had already suffered enough from the rain. We passed Laoshan at 10:30 AM, and the rain became heavier at 11:00 AM. The road was muddy and slippery, and the armed comrades and porters struggled greatly. We reached Jiuyan Mountain at 11:30 AM, and everyone dismounted to rest. We took the opportunity to eat tea and snacks to appease our hunger. At 12:00 PM, the whole group continued to move forward, but the rain still did not stop. Such persistent rain is rare in the north.</p>
<p>There were many interesting things that day. Before the entire group reached Laoshan, a man holding a rifle and wearing blue clothes suddenly emerged from the forest by the roadside. The sentry suspected that bandits had arrived and fired a shot. The man with the gun was startled, quickly put down his gun, and stated that he was a member of the security regiment. The soldiers hated that he should not have done so, and disarmed him. This is one thing. Mr. Xu Nairen of Central University is cautious in everything. Seeing people eating watermelon, Mr. Xu was worried that it was related to tiger plague, so he would say to the eater, "Be careful, be careful." Seeing swarms of flies about to fly, he would wave his hand and say, "Be careful, be careful." And he was very "careful" of all the members. So everyone called him "Uncle Hsu," Xu Yeshu. When we were about to arrive at Fushi at 5:00 PM that afternoon, the rope of the litter that Uncle Kou was riding in suddenly broke. Uncle Kou unexpectedly took a fall from the litter. After resting, Uncle Kou recalled the past and frowned and said, "Dangerous, dangerous." Seeing Uncle Kou's rather comical posture, everyone couldn't help but laugh. This is another thing.</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, we could see the pagoda of Fushi in the litters. After a while, County Magistrate Shi and Public Security Bureau Chief Li came riding to greet us. Fushi is the former Yan'an Prefecture. Its scale is quite large, and its commerce is more prosperous than in the previous counties. When we entered the city, we were too tired from the journey, and the whole group would be working in Fushi for two days, so there was plenty of time. Therefore, we did not immediately start investigating.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Hunan Province Stores and Melts Inferior Copper Coins <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Relieving Market Prices</p>
<p>To Maintain the Livelihood of the Common People</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The Hunan Mint produces a large number of copper coins every year. However, due to the poor quality, the market price has gradually declined. In the recent year or so, one silver dollar can be exchanged for more than 6,800 copper coins. The downward trend is alarming. Provincial Chairman He Jian believes that if a way is not found to save these inferior copper coins, the future price will be unimaginable, and the livelihood of the common people will be even more affected. Therefore, he specifically proposed a discussion on relief methods at the Provincial Government Council, which was handed over to the Finance Committee to formulate a plan. The main idea is for the Provincial Bank to raise cash, buy up the copper coins for storage, and restrict the exchange coupons in the market to facilitate the circulation of copper coins. Since its implementation, it has achieved some success, and the market price of copper coins has gradually improved. However, although the market price of copper coins has slightly recovered, the cash spent by the Provincial Bank to buy the copper coins cannot recover its cost. If the purchased copper coins are re-used, the harm will still be the same. The only way to save them is to first melt the inferior copper coins into copper plates, and then use electroplating to plate them with pure copper. It is estimated that 300,000 strings of copper coins, totaling 300,000 pounds of copper, will only produce 90% of the original amount, leaving 270,000 pounds, totaling 1,025 shi. At a price of 37 yuan per shi, it can be sold for 74,925 yuan. The machinery, remaining materials, and by-products such as copper sulfate can still be sold to offset some of the expenses. After deducting the purchase price of the copper coins (50,000 yuan) and the equipment expenses and interest, a net profit of more than 9,500 yuan can be obtained. This method not only benefits the Provincial Bank with increased income, but also has the prospect of raising the market price of copper coins. The Provincial Government has now ordered active implementation, hoping to achieve the actual effect of relief in the shortest time. (September 8th)</p>

<p>Discussion on Raising Funds for a Shelter for Vagrants: This county does not yet have a shelter for vagrants, leading to ruffians and vagrants having no place to be accommodated, which poses a concern for public safety. Previously, various organizations advocated for the early establishment of a shelter for vagrants and the organization of a preparatory committee. Director Li Xian was elected as the chairman to expedite preparations. In addition to the funds already raised for the establishment of the shelter, there is still no foundation for the source of recurring expenses. After several meetings, it was decided to raise donations based on the following principles: (1) Shop donations, reformed from the elimination of donations to beggar gang leaders, collecting approximately 300 yuan per month; (2) Monthly donations from charitable organizations and wealthy households, collecting approximately 200 yuan per month; (3) Temporary special donations, from households with weddings, funerals, or celebrations, reformed from the cancellation of beggar gang leaders stationed at gates, and freeloaders soliciting fees. Weddings and celebrations will contribute two yuan, and funerals will contribute one yuan, with each section of the local township police responsible for reporting. This is estimated to collect approximately 100 yuan per month. Hereafter, beggar gang names are not allowed, and the suppression of the unemployed vagrants and beggars will be strict, with accommodation and vocational training provided. It is tentatively planned to accommodate 100 vagrants. Once the funding is more ample, the quota will be increased. The shelter's estimated monthly expenditure is a minimum of 600 yuan. The Public Security Bureau, district offices, and county chamber of commerce have jointly drafted detailed rules for raising funds and replied to the preparatory committee for implementation.</p>
<p>Recent News from the Red Cross Branch: Zhou Xuewen, from the Songjiang branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, has achieved remarkable results since running the epidemic hospital stationed in Songjiang. Furthermore, Dr. Wang Peiyuan, the president of the society, has provided careful guidance on medical affairs, greatly benefiting the people of Songjiang. Dr. Ke Deqiong, the medical director of the society, has been dedicated to diagnosis and treatment day and night. Since the opening of the clinic on July 16, countless people have been saved. In addition to the subsidies from the society, there are also enthusiastic officials and gentry who voluntarily donate generously. Currently, County Magistrate Shen of Songjiang has donated 50 yuan, and Mrs. Zheng Bocang, the mother of Songjiang gentleman Zheng Bocang, has donated 100 yuan in the hope of a speedy recovery from illness. These donations have been forwarded to the society by Director Zhou. It is also heard that the hospital has decided at its fifth regular meeting to purchase land and build its own hospital buildings. Plans are now being drawn up, and preparations are actively underway.</p>

<p>Provincial Order Exempting Business Tax in War Zones: After this county was ravaged by the Japanese army, the business of various merchants has greatly declined, making it difficult to bear heavy taxes. Merchants have repeatedly petitioned the province, requesting exemption from business tax in the war zone to relieve commercial hardship. The order has already been approved. The Business Tax Bureau has notified the chamber of commerce. Merchants in this county can temporarily reduce a burden. However, Zhu Tieying, the editor of the Moye Bao, who pleaded for the merchants and suffered emergency punishment, has not yet been approved for bail. The judgment has already been sent out yesterday. It is heard that various district party headquarters, mass organizations, and the Taicang Association in Shanghai have unanimously telegraphed the province, requesting his release.</p>

<p>Theft of Guns and Ammunition from the Defense Corps: On the sixth night, around 11 PM, at the home of Shen Fuquan, a member of the second district, fourth jia defense corps in Xiyangjiacun, Nanxiang, suddenly five or six bandits, claiming to be communists, forced Shen to hand over firearms. Two rifles, over a hundred bullets, three yuan and eight jiao in silver, and a gold earring were stolen. Neighbors heard the commotion and shouted for help, causing the thieves to flee in panic. Nearby corps members gathered upon hearing the cries, surrounded and searched the area, but were unable to find them.</p>
<p>Police Officer Removed for Neglect of Duty: Several days ago, over three hundred refugees from Hunan were escorted into the county by police officers from the Baoshan Luodian Public Security Bureau, who then withdrew their escort. As a result, the three Chen Chunhua brothers and their families in Chenjiazhai were robbed of jewelry and silver, totaling approximately four to five hundred yuan. When the county Public Security Bureau and police team heard the news and sent a team to suppress the situation, after lodging overnight in Chengqiao, the refugees turned towards Loutang. When they reached Bazhiqiao, the Public Security Bureau police officers and police team withdrew on their own accord. As a result, the families of Jin Desheng and Jin Wenhao in the forty-second tu of Rui were robbed of jewelry and silver totaling over four hundred yuan. County Magistrate Pan, based on a report from the third district office, ordered Clerk Huang Chehou to investigate. After confirming the facts, he immediately removed and punished Lu Weiliang, the third squad leader of the county police team, Wang Xizeng, the patrol officer of the Xuhang Public Security sub-station, and Yang Hanqing, a member of the county Public Security Bureau, for neglect of duty.</p>

<p>Robbery on a Small Steamer Injures Passenger: The boats traveling between this county and Zhou Tieqiao, which is under the jurisdiction of Yixing County, departed from Yixing towards Wuxi yesterday morning around 3 AM as usual. Not long after setting off, four individuals resembling workers on the shore shouted to board the boat. The boat did not think much of it and allowed them to disembark after docking. The boat continued to sail. Unexpectedly, when the boat reached Songmaoqiao near Zhangshe, the four suddenly pretended to fight. Chen Genfu, the boat crew member, was about to go down to the cabin to investigate when he suddenly heard a loud bang. A bullet pierced the boat's plank. The crew and passengers, seeing this, knew they were being robbed and allowed the bandits to search and loot. More than ten passengers were spared nothing. In total, goods and cash worth approximately over two hundred yuan were robbed. After the bandits had finished looting, they fired another shot, hitting Chen Genfu, the boat crew member, in the left leg. Afterwards, the injured man was carried to Tongren Hospital for treatment. A loss report was filed with the county to request an investigation.</p>

<p>Eighty Percent of Funding Provided to Various Counties in Jiangsu: The Jiangsu provincial budget for this year has not been finalized due to a large discrepancy between revenue and expenditure. Various departments of the provincial government are now seeking ways to reduce spending. Regarding the funding for county governments at all levels in the province, Zhao Qilu, Commissioner and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, proposed it to the last provincial government committee. The committee decided to allocate 80% of the funding according to the 20th year's standard. The provincial government has now ordered the Civil Affairs Department to instruct the county magistrates to comply and has ordered the Finance Department to inform them.</p>
<p>Department Order to Organize People's Production Institute: Zhao Qilu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, noted that most People's Production Institutes in various regions have not been established. It is now planned to first organize and establish them in the ten counties of Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Danyang, Wujin, Taixian, Yizheng, Jingjiang, Jiading, Wuxi, Wuxian, and Wujiang as models.

The county has now learned that banditry on the embankment is rampant, and a small number of police officers may not be able to handle the situation. On the ninth, the county issued a supplementary order to Police Captain Wei Tingbi to transfer the entire fourth squad originally stationed in Shaobo to the embankment for stationing.

<p>Having just read a piece of Suzhou news under the headline "Investigation of the Case of Dereliction of Duty by a Judge in Wujin County" in the local news column of your newspaper on September 8, page 3, the content is completely inconsistent with the facts. Wei Yongquan is a clerk of this court. He has neither filed a complaint with the Ministry of Justice, nor has the Ministry of Justice dismissed us and handed us over to the Wu County District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Although we did go to Suzhou on the sixth of this month to respond to the interrogation of the Wu District Court Prosecutor, it was because the former President of this Court, Lei Renlong, was accused of dereliction of duty, etc., to the Ministry of Justice, and we were summoned to testify in court. Our attendance in Suzhou was purely in the capacity of witnesses and had nothing to do with the case. The report in your newspaper is based on hearsay and is untrue. We hereby urgently request a correction to avoid confusion. With regards, Sincerely, Wang Decheng, Judge, and Guo Guangchang, Clerk, Wujin County Court, September 8.</p>

<p>The Zhenru Campus Has Been Renovated and Looks Brand New</p>
<p>丨President Zheng Exerts His Utmost Efforts in Reconstruction</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, National Chinan University established schools in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Suzhou to prevent the interruption of overseas Chinese education. The results achieved were remarkable. Subsequently, after the ceasefire agreement was established, President Zheng devoted all his efforts to the reconstruction movement. The school buildings and teaching equipment in Zhenru that had been bombed and damaged by the Japanese army were repaired, restored, and purchased one by one, resulting in a completely new and impressive appearance. The cost was worth tens of thousands of dollars. To save expenses and for convenience, President Zheng specially purchased a diesel engine with more than forty horsepower as a generator. All the school's electric lights and running water are self-supplied, no longer relying on the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. At the same time, to expand the business and develop culture, the university also established its own printing press, purchasing printing machines and lead type. All the school's published books, magazines, lecture notes, and all documents can be printed in-house. The school suffered significant losses during the war, but was able to restore its original state in the shortest possible time, and from there, to further expand and develop. The scale is grand and the equipment is complete, which is truly rare. This is the result of President Zheng's painstaking management over the past few months. The school buildings have long been renovated and classes began on September 1st. The office on Hardoon Road in Shanghai was moved back before September 1st. The departments of major and secondary schools in Guangdong Province and the secondary school department in Suzhou are also continuing to move back. Secretary-General Yang Yufen, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts Chen Zhongfan, Dean of the College of Commerce Ye Yuan, Dean of the College of Science Yu Jitai, and Director of the Secondary School Department Kuang Songling, have been supervising the faculty and staff to devote themselves to the progress of school affairs and teaching affairs, which is very orderly. All new and old students paid fees, registered, and selected courses on schedule, and the opening ceremony is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. on September 12th, with formal classes beginning that day. In order to adapt to the needs of the post-war environment and improve efficiency, the courses offered by the school are all important, with very little duplication. Freshmen in the university department do not distinguish between colleges, and sophomores do not distinguish between departments, but specialize in common required basic courses. Only after the third year will they conduct specialized research to explore advanced knowledge. The secondary school department temporarily has two departments: normal and vocational, and will no longer set up a business department separately, but will open business courses. After all teachers and students of the school moved back to the original Zhenru campus, their spirits were exceptionally happy. Everyone is focusing on school affairs, teaching affairs, and academic work, which is truly a very good phenomenon.</p>

<p>Adding Departments of Political Economy and Art</p>
<p>Since its establishment this year, Zhengfeng College of Liberal Arts on Jiaozhou Road in this city, under the leadership of its President, the literary figure Mr. Wang Xishen, in order to live up to the Ministry of Education's promotion of education and to comfort the students' enthusiasm for learning, has engaged in expansion, adding departments of political economy and art. Mr. Zhu Xiangwan, a master of Chinese studies, has been hired as the director of the Department of Literature, lawyer Chen Tingrui as the director of the Department of Political Economy, and former Central University professor Wu Gaiting as the director of the Department of Art. In addition, former Jiangsu Education Director Jiang Zhuzhuang, former Civil Affairs Director Hu Pu'an, Guanghua University professor Qian Jibo, history expert Lü Simian, traditional Chinese painter Huang Zihong, and former Central University traditional Chinese painting director Lü Fengzi have been hired to take charge of various subjects. Other professors are also among the best of their time. Therefore, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic, and the freshman class of the Department of Literature has already exceeded the original quota. It is also heard that Mr. Wu Gaiting, the director of the Department of Art, mainly focuses on the study of traditional Chinese painting and sculpture, with the study of Western painting as preparation for the improvement of traditional Chinese painting. However, in view of the fact that most art schools in Shanghai tend to emphasize ideals and neglect application, and students feel the pain of having no way out after graduation, it is planned to focus on crafts and educational ability, with the aim of creating practical talents to meet the needs of the current society, and it is planned to officially name it the Department of Art Education, which is truly good news for the art world in our country.</p>

<p>Starting at 4:00 PM at the French Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Junior Singles Final at 2:45 PM</p>
<p>丨Sun Linfang Wins the Right to the Junior Singles Final丨</p>
<p>Shanghai's annual Robert Cup International Doubles Tennis Championship has reached its final stage. The final will be between China and the United Kingdom, and it is scheduled to be held at the lawn tennis court inside the French Chamber of Commerce on Avenue Joffre at 4:00 PM today. The Chinese players are Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, and the British players are De Foe and Whitt. The talents of both groups are evenly matched and their skills are outstanding. Today's battle can be said to be the most intense competition in this year's tennis season. The British group is very strong, and Lin and Qiu must be cautious in their operations, hoping to maintain the championship and complete the honor of holding it for three consecutive years.</p>
<p>In addition, the first game of the French Chamber of Commerce today, starting at 2:45 PM, will be the junior tennis singles final, with Sun Linfang against the winner of the semi-final between Hailies and Xunna this morning.</p>
<p>In the junior tennis singles at the Lawn Tennis Club, Sun Linfang played against Forbes in the semi-final at the China Tennis Court yesterday. Sun's forehand and backhand shots were quite reliable, and he often used balls of varying distance and direction to defeat Forbes, who often used chop shots. The battle was extremely calm. Both of them were extremely cautious. The victory or defeat of a ball was often judged after many exchanges, so the result of the three sets took one and a half hours. Sun won with a score of 6-4, 6-2, 6-4. Sun then won the right to the final.</p>
<p>Another semi-final was Hailies vs. Xunna, which will be played at the French Chamber of Commerce this morning. The winner will play against Sun Linfang in the final at 2:45 PM this afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Lawn Tennis Senior Singles Qiu, Lin, Zheng, De Enter Semi-Finals <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai Zheng Zhaojia De Foe</p>
<p>All Won the Right to the Semi-Finals Yesterday</p>
<p>丨Qiu Feihai Meets Lin Baohua in the Semi-Finals丨</p>
<p>The senior singles competition of the Lawn Tennis Club was completed yesterday. Qiu Feihai, De Foe, Zheng Zhaojia, and Lin Baohua won the right to the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, Qiu will meet Lin, and Zheng will meet De Foe. Yesterday, the two groups of Qiu Feihai vs. Jiang Daozhang and De Foe vs. Kanafanluo were held at the French Chamber of Commerce, and Zheng Zhaojia vs. Yu Tianguang was held at the China Tennis Court.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Wins Against Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>丨6-1, 6-1, 6-1丨</p>
<p>Qiu and Jiang started fighting at 2:45 PM. Because the situation of victory or defeat was very different, the shots were extremely casual. In the three sets, only two or three games had several spectacular shots. Both of them were flat-hitting on the baseline. It was also rare for Qiu to have deep and corner shots. In the first set, Jiang won one game by returning Qiu's powerful shot in the fifth game. In the second set, Jiang won one game in the third game, and in the third set, he won one game in the second game.</p>
<p>De Foe Wins Against Kanafanluo</p>
<p>丨6-2, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4丨</p>
<p>De and Ka then took the stage. De Foe still used a big-knife-axe-like attack of one shot and one kill. The first two sets were like breaking bamboo. By the third set, the clever Kanafanluo seemed to have seen through De's weakness and attacked De's backhand continuously, attacking the same side from near and far, left and right, and blocking and killing on the net. De Foe was exhausted from running around, and his strength gradually weakened. Although De Foe took the lead with a score of 4-3, he was still taken back by Ka for three consecutive games, winning a set. In the fourth set, Ka once took the lead with a score of 2-1. After that, the score was tied at 3-3 and 4-4. In the ninth game, Ka took the lead with a score of 3-1, and there was a great chance of winning this set again, but he was eventually reversed by De and won the whole game. De's victory took a lot of effort, and the number of self-inflicted balls was high. The backhand was not at all certain. Many shots aimed at the left and right sides went out of bounds, and he has regressed a lot compared to last year. Therefore, Zheng Zhaojia has a good chance of winning.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Wins Against Yu Tianguang</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia played against Yu Tianguang at the China Tennis Court yesterday. The two young players were formally playing each other for the first time yesterday. Yu was the champion of the open B group of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club in 1930, while Zheng was a well-known emerging athlete. This year's technology has made special progress. Under the battle, the levels were very different. Zheng's strength was hard and strong, while Yu's was relatively weak. Zheng's shots often made Yu unable to run, the situation was loose, and there was very little brilliance. Yu also had good performances when he went to the net to block shots. After Zheng won three games in the first set, Zheng served and won three consecutive points, but still failed. Yu served and won one game, and in the next game Zheng failed with a wild ball, making it 4-2. Zheng added two more games and won the first set with 6-2. After a short rest, they changed new balls to chase each other. The spirits of the two of them suddenly improved, and the competition felt more intense, and the situation became very tense. But soon Yu showed a weak state again. Yu won the third and sixth games, and Zheng won again with 6-2. Zheng then entered the semi-finals, and his opponent was the defending champion De Foe.</p>

<p>Barnes Recaptures Victory After Losing the First Two Sets</p>
<p>丨Ke Xian and Ailvsheng Each Win Two Sets丨</p>
<p>New York, Linshan, 9th Telegram: In the All-American Tennis Singles Semi-Finals, only one group of winners and losers was resolved today, that is, Barnes won against Clifford Seitz after a fierce battle. Ke Xian vs. Ailvsheng, each won one set, and the game was stopped due to darkness. The fifth set will be continued tomorrow to determine the final qualification. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Barnes 4-6 8-10 12-10 10-8 6-1 Seitz</p>
<p>Ke Xian 1-6 12-10 6-4 3-6 etc. continued Ailvsheng</p>
<p>Barnes Wins Over Seitz in a Fierce Battle Barnes was almost defeated by the rising star Seitz today. Barnes lost 4-6 in the first set. In the second set, after fierce competition, Barnes lost again with 8-10. Barnes played cautiously in the third set, and a total of 20 games were played before a winner was decided. Fortunately, Barnes seized a glimmer of hope and won two consecutive sets, turning defeat into victory. Seitz had eliminated British seed Austin in the second week and defeated Lord, the runner-up of last year's All-American competition, in the third week. Looking at the semi-final with Barnes again, although he failed after a hard fight, his results are admirable. (According to another telegram, Barnes won Seitz with 8-10, 12-10, 10-8, 6-1, which is missing one set of 4-6 from the above telegram)</p>
<p>Ke Xian and Ailvsheng Tied Ke Xian, the only French player left in the American army, played against Ailvsheng in the semi-finals today. Ke Xian lost 1-6 as soon as he took the stage. After entering, he won two consecutive sets with 12-10 and 6-4. The competition was extremely fierce, but the fourth set was won by Ailvsheng again with 6-3. After each winning two sets, the game could not be continued due to darkness. The fifth set will be played today to resolve the final qualification with Barnes.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Chairman Lin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai Pay a Visit</p>
<p>Accompanied by Mayor Wu in the Afternoon to Visit Wang</p>
<p>Chairman of the National Government Lin Sen arrived in Shanghai on the Jianghua ship of the China Merchants Bureau from Xun at 10:00 AM yesterday. He disembarked at the Jinliyuan Wharf and went directly to his residence on Jin Shenfu Road to rest. At noon, Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai both visited him. In the afternoon, accompanied by Mayor Wu, he visited Wang. According to Chairman Lin, he came here for medical treatment. Wang Jingwei is always extremely responsible and will never be negative. He himself will return to Nanjing in about three or four days, etc. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Situation of Arrival The Jianghua ship docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund at 10:00 AM yesterday. In advance, armed policemen from the Public Security Bureau and detectives from the French Concession were on guard around the area. Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Lu Ying, Captain of the Detective Team, etc., all personally came to direct the operation. The military band of the Public Security Bureau also played music at the wharf. Those who went to welcome him included Mayor Wu, and more than 20 of Lin's relatives, etc. After the Jianghua docked, Mayor Wu and others boarded the Jianghua and met Lin in the dining room. After a brief exchange of greetings, they disembarked. Lin and Mayor Wu returned to their residence by car. Not long after, Jiao Hongen, accompanied by Inspector General Gong Xikui, and Huang Jusu, etc., came to visit. They left soon after. At 11:40, Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai arrived and went inside to talk for an hour before leaving. Lin went out to visit Wang at 2:00 PM and returned to his residence in the evening.</p>
<p>Lin's Talk Lin was wearing a blue gown and black leather shoes yesterday. Although his temples were gray, his spirit was vigorous. Lin met with reporters from various newspapers in the dining room of the ship. The reporter (asked) Did Mr. Lin come to Shanghai to meet Mr. Wang to urge him to return to Nanjing? (Answer) I came to Shanghai to consult Dr. Lu Zhong'an of the Central Sanatorium because the ointment I took to Lushan last time was damp and unusable. I have also been suffering from asthma recently, so I came here for medical treatment. Mr. Wang is sick and I will visit him. There is no such thing as urging or comforting. I believe that after Mr. Wang's illness is cured, he will be able to return to Nanjing. (Asked) Zhang Hanqing does not leave North China and the military branch is still presided over by Zhang in reality after the change. It is rumored that Wang is negative, which seems to be the case. Is this true? (Answer) The North China Military Branch has been established and is temporarily responsible by Zhang. Wang's stay in Shanghai is entirely due to his illness. Mr. Wang has always been extremely responsible. The saying of negativity is not true. (Asked) When will Mr. Lin return to Nanjing? (Answer) I will stay in Shanghai for three or four days and then return to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Jiang and Cai Visit Lin Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai visited Lin at his residence at 11:40 yesterday and left at 12:35. When reporters asked Jiang and Cai about the results of their meeting with Lin, Jiang said, I have not met Chairman Lin for a long time, so I came to visit. I have not decided whether to return to Fujian on the 14th. I probably will not go to Hankou. I will take a boat back to Fujian as soon as there is one. Cai said that the visit to Lin was also a normal visit, because Lin is the Chairman of the National Government, and there were no other important matters. Probably the matter concerns military and political affairs, so it is inconvenient to publish.</p>
<p>Meeting Wang in the Afternoon Lin left his residence at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and his whereabouts were quite secret. However, at 4:30 PM in the afternoon, Lin and Mayor Wu took four cars separately, passed through Qi Qi Road to Fenglin Bridge, turned west, and met Wang at Wang's secret residence. Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai were also not at the residence in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Zhang Ji and Others Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>All Deny the Saying of Wang's Negativity</p>
<p>Tang Youren Said that Wang's Illness Has Worsened</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's whereabouts have been secret recently, and it is rumored that his attitude is negative. Yesterday morning, Zhang Ji, Zhu Jiahua, Chu Minyi, Zeng Zhongming, and other important figures came to Shanghai one after another to meet Wang. According to their statements, they all denied the saying of Wang's negativity.</p>
<p>Peng Xuepei Talks A reporter met with Neici Peng Xuepei in the morning. According to his talk, there were quite a few people who came together this morning (i.e., yesterday). Mr. Zhang Puquan also arrived in Shanghai. Mr. Wang is indeed sick and has not recovered. He came to Shanghai for medical treatment. The rumor that Wang is avoiding Zhang Xueliang's coming south is not true. I came here because I reported the ministry affairs to Mr. Wang. I met him in the morning. The date of his return to Nanjing has not yet been determined. The Third Plenary Session is still being postponed. Mr. Wang is actively initiating reforms on the articles of the National Senate, and it will be completed soon. When Minister Song of the Executive Yuan is not in Nanjing, the ministers take turns presiding over. The candidate for the president of the Executive Yuan has not yet been determined. Who will succeed him, but it is not certain. It will be proposed at the Third Plenary Session, etc.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming Talks Yesterday afternoon, a reporter met with Tieci Zeng Zhongming. According to his talk, I came to Shanghai to discuss railway matters and had no other mission. Mr. Wang has not met me from the time I arrived in Shanghai this morning until now. All kinds of rumors are just speculation, because Mr. Wang is indeed sick. Since he is being treated in the hospital, his return date will only be determined when his health has improved slightly. I have not heard about Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing in Nanjing. I have only seen reports of Zhang Xueliang's coming south. Listening to his tone, although he did not say that he wanted to persuade Wang, it is likely that Wang's illness cannot be cured in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Wang's Condition According to Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, Wang Jingwei's diabetes was said to have gradually recovered after he came to Shanghai for medical treatment, but recently it has relapsed and he has a fever, so he has to stay a few more days and try his best to treat it. He has to temporarily refuse to see guests to avoid being too tired. As for the rumor that his attitude is negative, it is absolutely not true. Today, Secretary-General Chu and others came to Shanghai because there were important public affairs to discuss and they had to ask Mr. Wang for instructions, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Japanese Plainclothes Police Activity in the French Concession <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Recorded in Two Western Newspapers</p>
<p>A Chinese Person Arrested</p>
<p>The Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that the French Consulate is preparing a protest note to be sent to the Japanese Consulate, formally protesting the case of Japanese plainclothes police officers arresting Chinese people in the French Concession yesterday. The content of the case is that many Japanese police officers, traveling in a car, without first obtaining the permission of the French authorities, went to a restaurant opened by a Korean on Luban Road No. 13 to arrest people. When they arrived, the restaurant was closed. The Korean owner was out. The Japanese police arrested a Chinese person inside the restaurant. When an Annamite patrolman heard the news, he invited several French patrolmen to rush to the scene, but the Chinese person had already been taken away. Only three plainclothes Japanese police officers were detained and taken back to the police station. Later, the Japanese Consulate sent someone to come and take the three people away.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times said that yesterday afternoon, an incident almost developed into a conflict between the patrolmen and the Japanese plainclothes police in the French Concession. The French consular authorities will protest to the Japanese side. The inside story and intention of this matter are not yet clear, but the methods used have greatly angered the French Concession officials. At about 2:00 PM yesterday, ten Japanese police officers, all in plain clothes, (according to the Continental News, the three people detained were wearing Chinese clothes), either in cars or other vehicles, met in front of a restaurant opened by a Korean on Luban Road No. 10. At that time, the restaurant was closed, and the owner was out, leaving only the hostess and a Chinese maid, and the maid's brother inside. The Japanese entered the room and asked the maid about the owner, but they could not find him, so they went upstairs together. At that time, a Chinese detective happened to pass by and saw the situation, so he quickly sounded the alarm, summoning many Annamite patrolmen. However, the Japanese had already kidnapped the maid's brother and drove away in a car. The Annamite patrolmen and others then detained three Japanese and took them back to the police station. Then, the Japanese Consulate sent someone to come and take them away. As for the Chinese person, he had not been released by the time this newspaper went to press. According to the French police station, the owner of the restaurant, a Korean, is a law-abiding citizen who has worked for the tram company for several years.</p>
<p>According to this newspaper's news, the incident happened the day before yesterday. When this newspaper received the news, it sent a reporter to the French police station to inquire, but because the chief patrol was not met, the details were not obtained, so it was inconvenient to publish. The reporter again inquired from all parties yesterday and learned that when the detectives searched No. 13 that day, a Chinese person was indeed arrested by the Japanese detectives, escorted into a car, and rushed away. However, everyone said that they did not know where he was being held. However, it was heard that the detained Chinese person, named Zhang Zhenxian, was from Hunan, and was a relative of the maid at No. 13. He was mistakenly detained because he went to visit.</p>

<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Four torpedo boats, the Fuji,  ,   , and the Wan, arrived in Shanghai on the 7th and 8th after the 24th Squadron destroyers left Shanghai, mooring in the Huangpu River. Yesterday, the four ships of the squadron received orders from Commander Sakonji of the Third Fleet to set sail from Shanghai for Zhenjiang in the afternoon. The entire squadron departed Shanghai yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Pukaze Returns to Shanghai: The Pukaze, a first-class destroyer belonging to the First Overseas Dispatch Squadron, was stationed in Nanjing. Yesterday, it received orders from Commander Sakano to withdraw from Nanjing to Shanghai, sailing into the Huangpu River in the afternoon and mooring on the Yangshupu River. There are currently eight Japanese warships in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Okano Arrives in Shanghai: The Geneva International League of Nations Conference is about to convene. Lieutenant Commander Okano Toshikichi, a naval aide to the Japanese plenipotentiary to the League of Nations, has been stationed in China for a relatively long time, is familiar with the situation in China, and is fluent in Chinese. During the Liaoning Incident, he served as a military attache stationed in Shanghai and is the author of the book "Talks on China". This time, the Japanese Ministry of the Navy dispatched him as an aide to the League of Nations Conference, instructing him to come to Shanghai from Japan to gather materials on the Manchurian Incident and the situation of Chinese boycotts. Okano arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Shanghai Maru. Japanese naval officials in Shanghai, such as Commander Sugita, Lieutenant Commander Okino, Captain Kitaoka, and Commander Yamaguchi, welcomed him at the Huishan Wharf. Upon landing, Okano went to the Atago warship to visit Commander Sakano and discuss the data on the Manchurian and Shanghai cases to be presented at the League of Nations Conference. According to Okano, he decided to travel to Europe via Siberia and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 13th of this month. He will also need to visit the puppet authorities in the Northeast to gather materials to take to Geneva.</p>
<p>Hirata Returns to Shanghai: Lieutenant Commander Hirata Masaharu, the Japanese naval attache stationed in Shanghai, also returned to Shanghai on the same ship as Okano yesterday. According to Hirata, speaking to Japanese reporters, Japan must do its utmost to protect the rights it has already acquired in various parts of China under the current situation. The entire nation is now united in recognizing that the government and the military have reached a consensus on taking decisive action regarding the phenomenon in the Yangtze River and Southeast regions that is detrimental to Japan. Only in this way can Japan survive.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Representative of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Army Zheng Guilin Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Negotiating Assistance for a Large-Scale Offensive</p>
<p>Visited Feng Yuxiang in Tai'an</p>
<p>Zheng Guilin, commander of the 48th Route Army of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, dispatched Chief of Staff Wang Youmei and Chief Counselor Ma Jun as representatives to enter the pass and seek aid in the south due to a lack of troops, ammunition, and clothing. The representatives arrived in Shanghai by train yesterday morning. A reporter from the Datong News Agency interviewed them at the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association and inquired about the combat situation of Zheng's troops, their journey south, and their mission. The following is an account of their conversation. According to the representatives, Zheng's troops consist of 20,000 men with over 8,000 guns, stationed near a certain place. Two weeks ago, they attacked Huludao but withdrew due to insufficient ammunition. As the weather is getting colder and the soldiers are still wearing single-layer clothing, and ammunition is also lacking, they are unable to launch a large-scale offensive. In the future, when the sorghum is harvested and the green gauze tent is lost as cover, combat will inevitably be more difficult. Therefore, Commander Zheng sent them to enter the pass and seek aid in the south, hoping that all sectors would find ways to provide assistance. They stated that they departed from their station on the 27th of last month, went on foot to Beidaihe, took the Beining Railway into the pass, transferred to the Jinpu Railway south, and when passing through Tai'an on the 6th of this month, they got off the train and stayed for one night. The next morning, they went to the Puzhao Temple on Mount Tai to visit Mr. Feng Yuxiang and had lunch at Feng's place. However, Mr. Feng was suffering from a toothache and his right cheek was quite swollen, so when they described the situation outside the pass, Mr. Feng kept crying but did not speak. They went down the mountain at 3:00 PM and took a train to Nanjing, where they reported to the Military Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and requested assistance, which was satisfactory. They then took a train from Nanjing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning (i.e., yesterday). In the coming days, they plan to contact various sectors in Shanghai to seek assistance and hope that all sectors will provide effective assistance. It is learned that the Support Association has planned to submit a proposal to the Standing Council to discuss assistance measures.</p>

Fortunately, you and others are sincere, loyal, and brave, rising up to resist the enemy, defending the country and guarding the frontiers, disregarding life and death, bathing in blood on the battlefield, advancing wave upon wave, crushing strongholds and breaking through fortresses, causing the enemy to tremble with fear, protecting our rivers and mountains, and safeguarding our nation. Your heroic spirit has spread far and wide, and the world admires you. We are eagerly awaiting news from overseas. We sincerely hope that you will continue your efforts, strive to kill the enemy, and achieve the goal of recovering lost territory. We overseas Chinese, living in foreign lands, even if we cannot emulate wrapping our bodies in horse hide and defending the country, we should also unite overseas Chinese and vow to be your rearguard. We are first sending 2,000 national dollars through General Zhu Qinglan of the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association as war funds for resisting Japan. Please accept it. We hope for a reply. The Overseas Chinese National Salvation Committee in Sulu, Philippines, salutes.</p>

<p>Public Memorial Service Held at the People's Grand Auditorium</p>
<p>Ji Hesun, the head of the Luodian Township Security Corps, personally supervised the corps members to defend the area and maintain local security after the Shanghai Incident occurred, but was tragically shot and killed. Currently, all sectors of the area, in order to commemorate the martyrs who died in the line of duty, have specially appointed Yang Weixiong and Zhu Lengfei to start preparing for a memorial service to comfort the loyal souls. The memorial service was originally scheduled for September 4th, but because it had to be held at the same time as the public burial, it has been rescheduled to September 18th. The cemetery has now been surveyed at the south end of Luoyang Bridge, and the First People's Auditorium has been tentatively designated as the public memorial hall. At that time, all the security corps members, schools, and groups in the area will wear black gauze armbands and escort the remains together.

<h3 id="e126">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Telegraph Office Requesting Exemption from International Telegraph Fees <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Public Welfare Should be Considered</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the International Telegraph Office yesterday, requesting exemption from international telegraph fees to benefit commerce. The original letter stated, "To whom it may concern, we have recently heard that there are proposals to increase the fees for submarine telegraphs and wireless telegraphs, and that this issue of increasing fees will be brought up for discussion at the International Telegraph Conference to be held in Madrid, the capital of Spain, around September 10th. Our Chamber believes that commerce is currently difficult, and the price of national currency is unusually low, which results in the cost of sending a foreign telegram being several times higher. Our Chamber deeply felt this pain throughout the past year. From this, it can be inferred that merchants are suffering from the high cost of telegraph fees, which is self-evident. According to the purpose of the Telegraph Office's business, it is to guide merchants to increase the ratio of telegrams sent in order to expand their business. Therefore, it is better to have small profits and large sales than to increase fees and make people retreat. At the current fee rate, telegraphers already feel that telegraph fees are expensive. Once the price is increased, the consequences are imaginable. This matter is inherently detrimental to commerce, and it seems that it would also reduce the business of the Telegraph Office. Moreover, the Telegraph Office should also have the responsibility of considering the public welfare, and it does not seem appropriate to only focus on increasing revenue. We should request your office to maintain the status quo and exempt Shanghai people from the burden of increased telegraph fees. That would be the most desirable."</p>
<h3 id="e127">Record of the Jishui Society Relief Conference <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The China Jishui Society held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the six relief groups the day before yesterday. Those present were Chairman Wang Yiting, Vice-Chairmen Xu Qianlin and Huang Hanzhi, and committee members Qu Wenliu, Zhou Shouliang, Zhu Yechen, Zhu Shoucheng, Wu Jichen, Feng Yangshan, and others. The conference agenda is divided as follows: (1) A certain Relief Director reported on the Wugong Relief in Shaanxi. The Shaanxi relief has now entered its fourth year. Last year, relief expenditures were very large. This year, the drought in Shaanxi is extremely severe, especially in Wugong and Fufeng. It has been repeatedly reported by Lu Hefu, the chairman of the Shaanxi Chang'an branch, and Wang Jishi and Cui Xianlou, the Wugong county chiefs, on the disaster situation. The Xinwei Relief Society donated 1,500 yuan, and this society donated 8,500 yuan, totaling 10,000 yuan, which were remitted twice. The day before yesterday, another 3,000 yuan were urgently donated together with the Relief Society. A drop in the bucket, it is still not enough. This society's donations are exhausted and we can only see what happens next. Another Relief Director reported that Yao Chongbang, the director of the Henan relief in Nanyang, Xinyang, Tanghe, and Biyang counties, reported that the first urgent relief in Nanyang and Tanghe counties, as well as seeds in Nanyang, totaled 25,454.00 yuan. The second urgent relief in Nanyang, as well as the first urgent relief in Biyang, Dengxian, and Xinyang counties, totaled 17,000 yuan. The bridge construction relief in Nanyang totaled 6,597.91 yuan. 35 fen. The above totaled 49,551.91 yuan. 35 fen. The relief in the five counties has been completed. Li Zizhong, a gentleman from Tanghe County, Henan, came to Shanghai to request relief. He also stated that there is too much wasteland in Tanghe and Dengxian counties in Henan, and a large sum of money is needed. We can only wait until the future to raise relief funds for seeds to save the people's livelihood. Someone reported on the work relief in the Dayou and Fuyou embankments in Nanchang, Jiangxi. The two embankments were washed away by the flood last year. After repeated requests and consultations, they were requested to cooperate with the Daode Society and this society. The Daode De Zhen donated 25,000 yuan, and this society donated 15,000 yuan, totaling 40,000 yuan. According to the Jishui Society's reliable work relief methods, Li Jun Yunmen was publicly elected to supervise the construction. Li Jun had already come to Shanghai and reported that the Tiexian Lake project of Fuyou embankment had been 60% completed, and the Yinjia Pond was also gradually under construction. The Nioweizha of Dayou embankment will take more time due to the low water level. Li Yunmen was publicly requested to handle it appropriately. Someone reported on the establishment of refugee camps in Bengbu, northern Anhui, and the joint urgent relief with the Xinwei Relief Society and the Red Swastika Society for the bandit disaster in Huoqiu. After the bandit disaster in the three counties, the people fled to Bengbu, and their hunger and suffering were indescribable. This society established two refugee camps in Bengbu, distributing food for relief, one at the Guanyue Temple and one at the Big Temple, housing a total of more than 1,100 refugees. Currently, the county seat of Huoqiu has been recovered, and the banditry in the urban and rural areas has gradually been quelled. This society and the World Red Swastika Society jointly organized urgent relief in Huoqiu, with each donating 5,000 yuan and the Xinwei Relief Society donating 3,000 yuan, totaling 13,000 yuan. Zhang Jun Zepu was publicly elected to be in charge and went to investigate and distribute. Now, in the two refugee camps in Bengbu, the people of Huoqiu, as the local area is gradually stabilizing, are requesting travel expenses to be sent back to their hometowns. This society has replied to consider providing travel expenses. The travel expenses will cost about 1,500 yuan. The public had no objection to the above cases. Someone reported on the epidemic situation this year and the distribution of medicine and relief in various provinces and this city. This year, the epidemic in various provinces is too severe, and the distribution of medicine is non-stop. A detailed list of the distributed medicine is available. Someone reported on the society's finances, the shortage of funds for those that have been determined but not yet paid, and the borrowed and advanced funds. A detailed statement of accounts is available separately. (1) Discuss how to provide relief to the victims in the three northeastern provinces. Feng Weiyangshan said, "Everyone rose up to help the disaster in the three northeastern provinces last year. The disaster this year is larger and more tragic than before. How can we ignore it?" Zhu Yechen said, "Our society should unite with all charitable organizations and do our best to collect donations to jointly handle the relief in the three northeastern provinces." The public agreed. (1) Someone proposed that the number of relief committee members is very small. It is appropriate to promote charitable comrades on the sea to jointly contribute to the righteous cause and realize the benevolent wish. The public unanimously agreed. The relief matters were resolved, the bell rang, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Endorsed Reorganization into a Contagious Disease Hospital</p>
<p>The Chapei Epidemic Hospital, initiated by Wu Xingya, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, and others, has been benefiting the poor since its establishment, earning a great reputation. The hospital convened its first board meeting on the 9th of this month at the Atlantic European Restaurant on Foochow Road. Eleven members attended, including Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Pan Gongzhan, Wen Zongyao, Zou Runqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yansong, Gu Xinyi, Wang Bin'yan, Zhu Yaxiong, and Zhang Binghui. Other board members, such as Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin, Lin Kanghou, Yang Xiaotian, Chen Renhe, and He Yiming, were absent due to other commitments. Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs Wu Xingya was temporarily ill and also absent. After the meeting proceeded as scheduled, Director Yu Qiaqing was elected as the temporary chairman. Zhang Binghui, a board member and director of affairs, then reported on the preparations for the hospital, stating that the hospital's opening expenses, including repairing buildings, purchasing medicines and equipment, etc., were handled frugally, and that no expense was excessive. The hired doctors were all experienced scholars who were serious and responsible for their medical duties. As a result, poor people came upon hearing of the hospital. In the month since opening, more than 700 patients have been treated, and more than 100 have been hospitalized. While we do not dare to boast of achievements, we can at least say we have done no wrong. However, the hospital is currently experiencing financial difficulties. During the preparatory period, Director Du Yuesheng advanced 5,000 yuan to cover the opening expenses. Now, little remains. We hope that all directors will enthusiastically maintain the hospital and work hard to raise funds in order to make progress. Next, Zhu Yaxiong, a board member and director of medical affairs, reported on the medical aspects of the hospital. Then, discussion began. The chairman reported that the proposal by Directors Zhu and Zhang to reorganize the hospital into a contagious disease hospital was more important, and requested that all directors express their opinions. After joint discussion, it was decided that Directors Zhu and Zhang would continue to actively prepare, and Zhang would also be responsible for negotiating a permanent cooperation agreement with the person in charge of the Guangdong Hospital. It was also decided that another meeting would be held at the end of this month to make further decisions, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Reaction to the 30th Telegram of the People's Movement Committee <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since the People's Movement Committee of the Central Party Headquarters issued the "Nurturing Telegram," it has aroused repercussions from industrial groups and domestic goods factories across the country. They have jointly issued a declaration, the details of which were recorded in previous reports. On the 30th of last month, the People's Movement Committee issued another "30th Telegram," which extended the meaning of the "Nurturing Telegram." Now, major factories have jointly issued a declaration. At the same time, the China National Products Maintenance Association, the Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products, the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, the Nanking Road Business Federation, the Shanghai Machine-made National Products Factory Federation, and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association (six groups), telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters to request clarification. The China General Federation of Industry also telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the Central Political Conference, and the National Government separately, requesting correction. The original text has been found and is copied below:</p>
<p>Declaration of Various Factories Regarding the "Nurturing Telegram" of the People's Movement Committee and the request for the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government to use extraordinary measures to force the start of work, we have previously expressed our opinions in the newspapers. After reading the newspaper, we learned that the People's Movement Committee had another "30th" telegram to Mayor Wu, stating that our declaration was a public criticism and disregard for the law, which deeply confused us. We believe that even if a court precedent is appropriate, scholars are still allowed to publicly comment after the judgment. Therefore, regarding the compliance of the People's Movement Committee's "Nurturing Telegram" with laws and regulations, we, who have a personal stake, hold a skeptical attitude and seek a fair answer, which is the same nature as criticizing precedents. We did not expect to be accused of disrespecting dignity and disregarding the law for this reason. This is something we did not anticipate and still do not understand. The "30th" telegram stated that the case has been investigated by the Municipal Government and should be resolved according to law. Therefore, the "Nurturing Telegram" advocating for extraordinary measures to force the start of work is in absolute opposition to resolving the issue according to law. If resolving the issue according to law is correct, then forcing the start of work is wrong. The People's Movement Committee stated that based on the workers' appeal to the committee, several months have passed, the situation has become more serious, and the requests of the factory owners cannot be the only consideration, ignoring the workers. Therefore, the only way to resolve this case is to urge the Municipal Government to quickly arbitrate according to the parties' requests. The reason why the "Nurturing Telegram" aroused criticism is the point of using extraordinary measures to force the start of work. If the government abandons its legal arbitration procedures and resorts to extraordinary measures, then both the employers and employees can abandon their legal procedures for requesting arbitration and each resort to their own extraordinary measures to seek victory. This would only increase the severity of the situation, not bring happiness to the people. We protect the Party and the country, protect order, and must protect the rule of law. Therefore, we have always been willing to offer sincere words as humble suggestions to the People's Movement Committee. If extraordinary measures are deemed necessary to achieve the goal of assisting workers, it is equivalent to the country establishing procedures for arbitration and all the usual means based on laws and regulations, exclusively to protect absolute private rights. Isn't the misunderstanding even worse? In short, to seek harmony between labor and capital, the rule of law must be respected first. To respect the rule of law, all extraordinary measures used outside the law must be rejected. Our so-called freedom of business refers to not being subject to extra-legal restrictions. As for monopoly business and prohibition of business, the laws have clear regulations, so there is no so-called extra-legal restriction, and it does not match the situation of Sanyou. The "30th" telegram used it as an analogy. Our simple minds cannot comprehend the deep meaning. As the saying goes, "The wind blows, and the grass bends." It also says, "The law is implemented from above." The organization leading the people must first respect the rule of law, so that the law does not become a mere formality. This is what we sincerely hope for. Please consider it carefully. [List of 60 factories]</p>
<p>Six Groups' Telegram to the Central Party Headquarters (Gray Telegram) To the Central Executive Committee in Nanjing, Greetings. The People's Movement Committee under your jurisdiction, in its 30th Telegram to Shanghai Mayor Wu, still insisted on using extraordinary measures to force employers to start work by a deadline in the Sanyou Industrial Company's labor-capital dispute, and stated that these manufacturers cited the Provisional Constitution to seek freedom of business, calling it a false pretext against the revolution, making the people reading it shudder. The Regulations on the Exercise of Governing Power, publicly announced on July 10, 1929, clearly state that the people's life, property, and freedom of body are protected by law and shall not be deprived without due process. Those illegally deprived are considered to have exceeded their authority. Is forcing employers to start work a deprivation of the people's freedom of property? The People's Movement Committee recommended it, is it without due process? Mayor Wu implemented extraordinary measures, did it exceed his authority? Once these are examined in detail, the correct answer can be found. Then, can the Regulations on the Exercise of Governing Power still be called law? Extraordinary is the opposite of ordinary. This only occurs when martial law is declared, and ordinary laws are suspended. Has Shanghai reached that state today? Since ancient times, when politics have been chaotic and laws have been disregarded, the people have often not followed the government's orders, but rather followed their own will. The government's control over the people has thus fallen into the path of "If one is not upright, even orders will not be followed." This kind of political phenomenon has long become an iron law that no country can avoid. Judging from this case, the extraordinary coercion, deprivation, and exceeding authority are all evident. However, from the Provisional Constitution to the above-mentioned Regulations, as well as various single laws on labor and labor-capital relations, all are laws. Applying them to resolve this case is more than sufficient. Now, instead of guiding the people to follow the law, they are replaced by extraordinary means, causing chaos. (Omission) Is this the will of Sun Yat-sen? (Omission) Speaking frankly, the suffering of the workers has reached its extreme. People are not made of wood or stone, how can we not sympathize? However, rescuing people from a well may result in the rescuer being drowned as well. Trying to help seedlings grow by pulling them up will ultimately lead to failure. The government, in charge of protective administration, also has its appropriate scope. Going beyond this, it becomes awkward. Your esteemed committee, as the central authority, coordinates the overall situation. In addition to the above questions, we respectfully request clarification on how to balance law and reality and reconcile labor and capital. The associations will respectfully comply with all instructions. We await your orders with utmost anxiety and anticipation. China National Products Maintenance Association, Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products, Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, Shanghai Machine-made National Products Factory Federation, Nanking Road Business Federation, First District Branch of the Citizens' Association, collectively.</p>
<p>The China General Federation of Industry's Telegram To the Central Party Headquarters, the Central Political Conference, and the National Government, Greetings. Previously, we read in the newspapers that regarding the labor-capital dispute at the Shanghai Sanyou Industrial Company, the People's Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters sent a "Nurturing Telegram" to the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, requesting that they use extraordinary measures to force the start of work. Our association, based on the freedom of business stated in the Provisional Constitution, previously telegraphed the situation. At the same time, we requested that the highest Party and government authorities consider and explain the matter. While we were waiting for instructions, the People's Movement Committee issued another "30th Telegram," which, in addition to extending the meaning of the "Nurturing Telegram," also stated: (1) According to the highest principle of the People's Livelihood, the Provisional Constitution is not designed to protect absolute private rights. (2) Although business can be free, such as state monopoly business and prohibited business, it is not free. (3) There is no other country with the Three Principles of the People in the world, so there is no precedent for assisting workers. (4) The Party of the Three Principles of the People has the courage to create unprecedented examples in the world. We in the industrial business are inexperienced and have limited knowledge. We certainly do not understand the true meaning of the Party's principles as clearly as the People's Movement Guidance Organization. However, referring to the laws and regulations promulgated by the Central Government in the past, as well as the grand words and honest opinions expressed by the wise men of the Party and the country, found in various public and private documents and publications, their spirit and purpose generally do not match the points advocated by the "Nurturing Telegram" and the "30th Telegram." We deeply feel that, in the highest position of leading the people, at a time when labor-capital relations in China have not yet been harmonized, if one suddenly wants to establish a new path outside the scope of the law, then there is concern that the existing laws will lose their effectiveness, and the future facts will become more and more chaotic, complex, and difficult to handle. Considering the situation, this kind of extraordinary step does not seem to be tolerated by the current national society's emphasis on the rule of law. It is also a point that should be corrected urgently from the Party's standpoint. Investigating the highest principle of the People's Livelihood of the Three Principles of the People, the purpose is not only to seek welfare for all the people, but also to take into account the people's economic private rights. The Provisional Constitution, in this spirit, specifically established Article 37 to protect them. Outside the provisions of the article, only business that violates the law may have its operation stopped by law, and there is no provision for under what circumstances the law can force its operation. Furthermore, the Regulations on the Exercise of Governing Power promulgated by the Central Government in July 1929 state that the people's life and property are protected by law and shall not be deprived without due process. Illegal deprivation is considered exceeding authority. From these two points of view, the Provisional Constitution and the Regulations on the Exercise of Governing Power have not abandoned the protection of the people's private rights and the freedom to operate or cease operations. Under today's rule of law in China, it is still preserved as a right granted to the people by law and cannot be equated with state monopoly business and prohibited business, which have different natures. Respectfully reading the "30th Telegram," it says that there is no other country in the world with the Three Principles of the People, only China has it; there is no precedent in the world for assisting workers, and it relies on China to create it. However, we have occasionally glanced at foreign records regarding the assistance of workers. Internationally, there is the International Labor Bureau; in various national governments, there are labor departments to handle national labor administrative matters. Other matters, such as labor training, insurance, and savings, also have special agencies to handle them, which have become the focus of social undertakings. The precedents and old chapters seem to have existed for a long time. If it is said that extraordinary measures must be used to force the start of work and that this is considered the only policy to assist workers, we do not dare to think so. In short, we understand that, according to the highest principle of the People's Sovereignty, the government is the organization of the people, not the organization of the government. Today, the country has created a fundamental law with the aim of promoting politics and the people to get on the right track. On the one hand, it allows political forces to leave the standpoint of the law and use facts and emotions to resolve the law. The contradiction between them cannot help but make the general public doubt.

<h3 id="e133">The Cotton Textile Industry Union of the Seventh District petitions Mayor Wu for emergency measures <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Sanyou Factory's Employer Stopped Providing Food Expenses</p>
<p>The Ta Kung She reports that the municipal government submitted the labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Company's Xiangyin Road factory to arbitration on the 31st of last month. The arbitration ruled that the employer should resume work. However, the employer used the excuse of appealing and stopped paying for food expenses. The Cotton Textile Industry Union of the Seventh District yesterday presented a petition to Mayor Wu, which stated: "The petition is for the employer's deliberate excuse to appeal and stop paying for food expenses, and we request emergency sanctions. We believe that this case has been in dispute for eight months. On the 31st of last month, your government organized an arbitration committee and announced the arbitration, but the employer broke his promise and refused to accept the arbitration. As a result, the workers' clothes and belongings have been pawned. As the weather is getting colder, they have no way to keep warm. We immediately prepared a document to petition your government to strictly enforce the central 'Nurturing Telegram' based on the central government's instructions. On the 7th of this month, it was time to receive food expenses. Representatives Xia Zhongzhao and Gong Zishen were sent to the company with Zhu Guilin, a representative of the Bureau of Social Affairs, to collect the expenses. The managing director Wang Xianhua met with them and said that he would have to ask the board of directors before paying. He said that he would probably not stop paying and asked them to come back on Friday to negotiate. When they went again with Chen Heqing, a representative of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Wang Xianhua still met them and said that he would definitely pay the full amount before 11:00 AM the next day. When they went again the next day, Wang Xianhua suddenly said that food expenses had also been stopped and no one was responsible, so they still did not receive it. It is found that the employer deliberately delayed and used every means. Recently, they have become even more aggravated and stopped providing food expenses, which not only caused the union's thousands of workers to suffer cruelly, but also put the Central People's Movement Committee's 'Nurturing Telegram,' the Ministry of Industry's 'Yang Telegram,' and your government's No. 142 approval in what position? Now, this case has no end in sight, and food expenses have been stopped again. Alas, the lives of the workers are not worth pity, but I am afraid that the government's credibility will be swept away. Therefore, we have specially prepared a document to petition your government to quickly take emergency measures to value the lives of the people, which is both a public virtue and a convenience. Respectfully presented to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai, by the Cotton Textile Industry Union of the Seventh District of Shanghai."</p>

<p>The Far East News Agency reports that the four former standing committee members of the Labor Union of the Chinese-Owned Electricity Company, Zhu Hanhe, Tang Junsheng, Zhou Guangrong, and Zhang Ruoyu, were expelled from the Labor Union because they were dissatisfied with all the workers. At that time, Zhu and others voluntarily asked the company for leave in order to ease the atmosphere and take the opportunity to advance again. Soon after, Zhu and others suddenly asked the company to cancel their leave. All the workers were greatly surprised and took leave to passively resist. A total of more than 37 people caused some trams to temporarily stop running, which made transportation inconvenient. The company also felt that it was not a good solution to delay for a long time. Therefore, Lu Zhonglin, the acting director of transportation, came forward to mediate. Zhu and others have already stopped going to work at the company. The 37 workers who took leave have also had their leave cancelled by the Labor Union representative yesterday (the 10th) and are scheduled to continue working at the company today. A storm has been resolved invisibly.</p>

<p>The Taxpayers' Association Again Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>Requesting Prompt Joint Handling of the Case</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that according to a letter from lawyer Gu Xianzhang, he received a bill from the Shanghai Telephone Company and this morning received a letter from the company ordering him to pay the telephone bill from March 27 to September 30 of this year, amounting to thirty-three taels, three mace, and seven candareens of silver, in full by September 12, otherwise his telephone service will be suspended. We have learned that the company's price increase announcement was only disclosed in the newspapers on July 1. Now, in its letter, the company is demanding payment of telephone fees dating back to March 27. This type of price increase procedure violates the legal principle of 'no retroactivity.' Moreover, the contract signed between the Public Works Department and the company stipulated that after the telephone is converted to automatic operation, good service should be provided to the public, and special consideration would be given. Our telephone often experiences interruptions and dial tone problems, making it impossible to make calls in a timely manner. It often takes half an hour to contact the repair and inquiry departments of the company to request assistance, but even then, it is not possible to speak immediately. Can this type of service be called 'good'? This is not something the company can unilaterally decide. Unless all parties are brought together for a fair judgment, how can things be done fairly? We have reported these circumstances to the association. Inquiries regarding telephone price increases and incomplete service have been repeatedly submitted to your department for reconsideration. The situation described in the letter further proves the incompleteness of the service. We are writing to request that your department promptly handle the case jointly to avoid disputes."</p>

<h3 id="e141">Appeal Judgment in the Zhicheng Gold Shop vs. Tian Xiangzhen Case <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Tian Ordered to Repay Over Six Thousand Nine Hundred Taels</p>
<p>Feng Chaolun, the owner of Zhicheng Gold Shop, needed to buy and sell spot gold on behalf of customers but did not have the qualifications of a broker. Therefore, he affiliated his business name with brokers inside the Gold Exchange, such as Tongyurun, Yuanchun, Hengyu, and Jufengrun, i.e., the so-called "small colleagues." Acting as agents of these brokers, he bought and sold on behalf of customers. In the spring of last year, through the introductions of Wang Yiren, Tao Shutang, and others, Tian Xiangzhen began doing business with Zhicheng. He successively entrusted them to conduct spot gold transactions, establishing account names such as Ruji, Hengji, Zhenji, and Yingji. Profits and losses were settled monthly. By August of the autumn, after deducting the deposit, he owed six thousand nine hundred taels, nine mace, one candareen, and two cash of silver. Feng repeatedly demanded payment, but Tian ignored him and refused to pay. Feng then sued him in the First Special District Local Court. Tian, however, used the excuse that Zhicheng was not a broker, fabricating sophistry, saying that transactions in the exchange must be done by a broker to be legal. The Exchange Law does not allow buying and selling under the name of an affiliated broker. Even if there were transactions, they would be over-the-counter transactions, so the owed losses are naturally invalid. The judge in the first instance seemed to not understand the situation of the exchange and did not conduct a detailed investigation, thus being deceived. He then ruled against the plaintiff. Feng refused to accept the judgment and immediately hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to represent him and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. He clearly stated the facts of the case and the customs of the exchange in the appeal, requesting that the original judgment be overturned, that the owed amount be repaid according to the debt, and that the costs of both instances be borne. Moreover, since the appellant Tian Xiangzhen has now fled, fearing that he would not be able to compensate if the judgment is determined before execution, he specifically requested permission to declare provisional execution to protect his interests. Hu Min, the presiding judge of the Second Branch of the High Court, along with judges Ye Zai and Cai Zhaoying, held a hearing, summoning witnesses and documentary evidence. After careful examination, they recognized that the various documents submitted by Feng Chaolun were consistent after verification and without flaws, so Tian Xiangzhen's empty denial could not be allowed. They then changed the original judgment, ordering Tian Xiangzhen to repay Feng Chaolun six thousand nine hundred taels, nine mace, one candareen, and two cash of silver, plus interest at an annual rate of five percent from September 16, 20th year, until the end of execution. The litigation costs of the first and second instances were to be borne by Tian Xiangzhen. This judgment should be provisionally executed. Yesterday, the court ordered officials to deliver the judgment to the lawyers of both parties and informed them that if they did not accept the judgment, they could appeal to the Supreme Court within the statutory period.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Continued Trial of the Huade Road Murder Case <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Defendant Claims It Was Not Intentional Homicide</p>
<p>He and the Deceased Were Friends for Four Years</p>
<p>Chen Yun (also known as Ke Ming), a 33-year-old Shaoxing native residing in the pavilion upstairs at No. 7 Chengxin Fang, Huade Road, allegedly used a kitchen knife to wound his friend Wang Zixi (i.e., Huang Zixi), a 23-year-old Pudong native, in the head and arms at around 5 a.m. on the 7th of this month. Wang died at Tongren Hospital at around 9 a.m. The prosecutor dispatched by the First Special District Court to the Philomene Road morgue to examine the body. Chen Yun was arrested by the Huishan Patrol and taken to the Fourth Criminal Court for interrogation, the details of which have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong continued the investigation. The patrol lawyer said that the deceased, before his death, pointed out that the defendant was the leader of the Communist Party. Six Communist books, including "The Road to Light" and "The Soviet Government," were found in Chen's bedroom and immediately submitted for inspection. However, the defendant firmly denied being a Communist Party member at the patrol station, so no additional charges were added, and the matter will be investigated further. The defendant claimed at the patrol station that he and the deceased had been friends for four years. He has no occupation, and his wife and three children have been staying at the deceased's home for about four months, with all expenses being provided by him. He also entrusted him to collect rent. However, the defendant later embezzled forty yuan and did not hand it over, so the deceased stopped providing support, and the defendant's wife and children returned to their hometown. On the 6th of this month, the deceased went to a place in Yangshupu to pay membership fees and stayed at the defendant's house for two nights, which led to this incident. Li Xuming testified that he is a Pudong native, and the deceased Huang Zixi is his wife's brother. He works as an accountant at the Huayang Beef Shop at No. 980 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. His family lives in the countryside. He has known the defendant for three or four years. The defendant used to sell peaches in the Xiaode Road vegetable market. The deceased became friends with him because he bought peaches. At that time, the defendant was honest and trustworthy and had the deceased's trust. The deceased had several bungalows in Xiaonanmen. Because the defendant was financially struggling and could not pay the rent, he allowed him to live there rent-free. Later, he heard that the defendant had embezzled dozens of yuan of rent for his own use. On the 5th of this month, his father-in-law, Huang Jintang, the deceased's father, came to Shanghai from Pudong to collect membership fees and take them to a place in Yinxianggang. He does not know what his father and son talked about. After the incident, he went to the hospital to visit, but the deceased could not speak. The court asked if the deceased liked to read Communist books in the past, and he replied no, he only liked to read books like "Guwen Guanzhi." Now, his father-in-law, Huang Jintang, returned to Pudong immediately after arriving at the morgue due to grief. Li Haiqing testified that he is a night watchman in Chengxin Fang, Huade Road. A woman from No. 5 residence told him that someone was calling for help inside No. 7. He went to check and saw that the window of the pavilion upstairs was open, and the deceased was covered in blood and about to jump down. At that time, Patrol Head Feng also arrived after hearing the alarm and helped to capture the defendant. The defendant escaped through the front door, but was unable to escape because the iron gate at the entrance of the alley was closed. Patrol Head Feng Ruisheng testified that he lives at No. 17, opposite the back door of No. 7. At around 5 a.m. this morning, he heard someone calling for help inside No. 7. He heard it again a minute later. He quickly got up and went outside, seeing the deceased standing at the window, about to jump but stopping. He immediately said, "Don't worry, I'll come to save you," and broke through the back door. The defendant escaped from the front door. He went straight up to the pavilion upstairs. The deceased said, "Save me quickly," and he helped him to lie down on a desk near the window, seeing that his head and arms were injured and covered in blood. He was wearing a short shirt and pants but was barefoot. There was a bedding on the desk, and there were books on the desk. There was also a canvas bed in the drawer, stained with blood. There were also blood stains on the floor. He did not have time to ask him what happened and immediately called the fire brigade to go to Tongren Hospital. Detective Chen Baozhong testified that after the incident, he and Western Detective No. 309 went to the hospital to investigate. The deceased said that he was a partner at the Huayang Beef Company at No. 980 Baochang Road and had known the defendant for many years. He is a formal member of the Communist Party. After saying that, he stopped speaking. Yong Ren Yan Fuchang testified that his mother is the second landlord of the house, but his elderly and frail mother did not appear in court today. The defendant moved in alone, without a wife. He has never seen the deceased come before. He works in a certain place on Guling Road and does not sleep at home at night. When questioned, the defendant claimed that the desk was his, and the Communist books belonged to someone else. He did not pay attention. He firmly stated that because the deceased asked his wife to come to Shanghai, touching his (blank), he used a knife to cut him. (Blank) he resisted, grabbing his right hand and (blank), he did not intentionally kill him at the time, causing him this pain. Judge Shen searched (blank) and questioned him for a long time. The defendant remained steadfast, so he ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Employees of Two Railways Donate Salaries to Build Memorial Hall <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The traffic departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways yesterday issued a notice to all station employees along the lines, stating: "According to a report from Puyi Dengqing, chairman of the memorial hall construction committee for employees of the two railways who died in the national crisis, the fourth meeting of the committee resolved to adopt the design of Commissioner Fan for the construction of the memorial hall. The situation has been reported. However, the meeting at that time unanimously agreed that the budget for the design is estimated to require 30,000 yuan. In addition to the 10,000 yuan construction fund approved by the public welfare committees of the two railways, there is still a huge shortfall. It seems difficult to realize the project without raising additional funds. It was then proposed to request the administration to issue a notice to all employees of the two railways to donate one day's salary each to serve as a fund for the construction of the memorial hall. This was unanimously approved. During the January 28th Incident, the employees of the two railways who died bravely defended the railways, their heroic deeds are known throughout the country. The colleagues of the two railways should also deeply sympathize with the commendation of the loyal and the martyrs. It is appropriate to extract the motion and submit a report, respectfully requesting your lordships to order all employees of the two railways to donate one day's salary each in September for use as a fund for the construction of the memorial hall to honor the martyrs and comfort the loyal souls. Therefore, it is deemed feasible to issue a notice to all employees of the two railways to donate one day's salary each for the memorial hall fund in order to commemorate the martyrs. The donation method should be deducted from salaries within 90 taels per month to facilitate construction. In addition to distributing the notice, order the department to immediately inform all subordinates."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Conditions of the South City Wharf Renovation <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Dredging and Repair of Floating Wharves Have Been Completed Long Ago</p>
<p>Embankment Project Can Be Completed Around October</p>
<p>It Can Rival the International Settlement in a Few Years</p>
<p>The wharves in the Sixteen Puli area of ​​Nanshi in this city were originally operated by merchants. The municipal authorities only collected taxes from the merchants and never intervened, resulting in many malpractices. Since the establishment of the municipal government, it ordered the Port Authority to take back the wharves with compensation and renovate them, and set up a wharf management office. At the end of the 19th year, the Port Authority was abolished, and the Public Utilities Bureau took over. The bureau believed that the wharves and warehouses were related, so it reorganized the wharf warehouse management office and separately appointed Xu Yuanfang, secretary of the bureau, as director, and Gao Shuan as deputy director. Since the bureau took over, it has strived to economize on office expenses and expand business expenses. Therefore, in less than two years, the wharf buildings have been completely renovated, and the management is also well-organized. Even in the current situation, it is more complete than the French Concession. In a few years, it can rival the International Settlement. The reporter paid a special visit to Director Huang Boqiao of the bureau yesterday to inquire about the bureau's operation of the wharves in the Nanshi area and the situation before the takeover. He was informed in detail and sent Director Xu Yuanfang and Deputy Director Gao Shuan to accompany him to visit the wharves in the Nanshi area. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Huang's Remarks: The Shanghai Nanshi steamboat wharves were originally operated by merchants (Dada Steamboat Company and Datong Shipping Company), so there are still Dada Wharf and Datong Wharf to this day. Later, various shipping companies believed that the Dada and other companies monopolized and controlled the wharves, affecting the shipping industry, and appealed to the municipal government. Therefore, in the 19th year, the municipal government ordered the competent Port Authority to take back the wharves with compensation and renovate them, and set up a wharf management office to be responsible for the work. At the end of the 19th year, the Port Authority was abolished and closed. The municipal government believed that the wharf part belonged to the scope of public utilities, so it was assigned to the bureau for continued operation in accordance with the municipal organization law. The bureau believed that the wharves and warehouses were related, and the warehouses had the function of assisting the development of the wharves, so it planned to operate the warehouses concurrently and changed the wharf management office to the wharf warehouse management office. When the bureau took over the Shanghai Nanshi wharves, the embankments were collapsed, the wharves were dilapidated, and the situation was so bad that it was almost unbearable. What made the shipping companies feel particularly difficult was that the water depth of each wharf was only one or two meters or so, and most of the ships could not dock. The order of the wharves was also chaotic, with vendors crowded, passengers and goods almost impossible to pass, and gangsters rampant, extorting money as commonplace. The bureau believes that under this situation, it is impossible to realize the municipal government's renovation proposal without thoroughly renovating and reforming. Therefore, on the one hand, it disbanded the original patrol team and established a wharf police station jointly with the Public Security Bureau, which was jointly commanded by the First District General Office and the wharf warehouse management office. It spared no effort to eliminate vendors and gangsters, and did everything possible to relieve the suffering of shipping companies and travelers. On the other hand, it applied to the municipal government for temporary funds to carry out dredging, repair of floating wharves, and embankment projects. The former two have been completed long ago, and the latter can also be completed around mid-October, with a total cost of no less than 300,000 yuan. It is making every effort to expand, in addition to the original wharves No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, and 16, wharves such as No. 9, 11, 12, 13, and 17 are also being planned for addition, and Wharf No. 9 is currently being built by the leased Lianan Shipping Bureau with垫欵, which is expected to be completed around Double Ten Festival. The bureau's only purpose in operating the wharves is to make it convenient for ships to dock, safe for passengers to get on and off, arouse the interest of Chinese people in traveling, and assist the development of the shipping industry. As for the management policy, it strives to economize on office expenses and fully expand business expenses. Therefore, although the current expenses have been repeatedly reduced due to the financial difficulties of the municipal treasury, it can still increase all equipment related to the safety of travelers, such as wharf lights, lifebuoys, and iron gates. If the municipal government can allow the wharf funds to be independent and operate completely according to the nature of the business, then the future development will be faster and more certain.</p>
<p>From Dongmen Road to Lujiabang, there are 17 wharves. From No. 1 to No. 8, they have been completely renovated. The other wharves are also being repaired and painted. All wharf building materials include two types: steel plates and foreign pine. The embankments are all built of stone blocks and have cement railings. From Dongmen Road to Guanqiao, the wharves are cleaned twice a day, so they are very clean. There are also designated places for loading and unloading goods to avoid hindering traffic. Vendors are absolutely not allowed to set up stalls on the wharves, but they are allowed to trade on the ships. Trucks transporting goods and passengers are only allowed to park in the open space on Dongmen Road and are not allowed to enter, so the order is extremely tidy. The coolies carrying goods on the wharves are all required to wear numbered clothing, otherwise they are not allowed to carry goods for customers. Therefore, there are very few cases of passengers losing their luggage. Recently, the warehouses in the Sixteen Puli area have generally felt that there is no place to stack goods, which is enough to show that general merchants are willing to load and unload goods in Nanshi. Therefore, the wharves in the Nanshi area can directly guarantee the safety of passengers after being renovated, and indirectly increase the prosperity of the steamboat business.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Coal Shop Manager Accused of Fraudulently Selling Goods Privately <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Ge Jihua, the general manager of Zhongyuan Yiji Coal Shop at No. 42 Rongyang Lane, Pingwang Street, International Settlement, reported to the French Patrol the other day that the manager Huo Rongbo fraudulently used the name of Mingji Coal Shop to defraud Zhongyuan Coal Shop of more than 400 tons of Boshan coal and sold it privately to Tongyi and Guangtaishun silk factories. He then hid in the Anna Kim Road area under his jurisdiction, requesting an investigation. After receiving the report, the patrol head immediately ordered Detective Liu Jinrong to arrest Huo at his residence at No. 196 Anna Kim Road. Huo was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court yesterday, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the second criminal court for interrogation. First, Patrol Lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case, saying that the defendant violated Article 363 of the Criminal Law, committing crimes such as fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust. The defendant defrauded more than 400 tons of coal between August 1st and 10th, and requested an investigation according to law. Then, the plaintiff Ge Jihua stated that the defendant was previously the manager of Zhongyuan Coal Shop and sold the bills of lading for more than 3,000 tons of Boshan coal from the Hanyang Coal Depot to Mingji Coal Shop for a total of 33,700 yuan. A contract was signed, with one payment in advance and the remainder to be paid within one month. Unexpectedly, he could not collect the money when it was due, and Huo avoided meeting him. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court, requesting compensation and requesting to detain the coal sold by Mingji to Tongyi and Baotaishun silk factories. Unexpectedly, the defendant Huo Rongbo suddenly came forward and issued a letter stating that the coal of Tongyi and Baotaishun factories was his personal property and all payments should be collected by him. He has a letter to prove that this Boshan coal was clearly sold by Zhongyuan Coal Shop to Mingji, and then resold by Mingji to Tongyi Baotaishun. The ownership of the goods still belongs to Zhongyuan Coal Shop, which clearly shows that the defendant has committed the crime of embezzlement, fraud, and breach of trust. He also hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to state everything and requested an incidental private lawsuit to recover the payment. Huo Rongbo confessed that the coal of Zhongyuan Coal Shop was actually sold to Mingji Coal Shop through the introduction of a merchant. Later, because they did not like the quality of the goods, they requested a deduction in price, so they stopped payment. As for the coal of Tongyi and Baotaishun factories, it was indeed the merchant's property. The reason is that the two factories had previously signed a one-year contract with Zhongyuan Coal Shop. During this period, all the coal used was supplied by Zhongyuan. Unexpectedly, in January of this year, Zhongyuan Coal Shop stopped supplying due to the impact of the war. Therefore, the two factory owners negotiated with me. In order to maintain the contract, the merchant purchased coal from Yicheng and several other coal shops in his personal name and supplied it to Tongyi and Baotaishun factories. There have been more than 1,000 tons so far, which can prove that Mingji is not a merchant's shop, let alone a shareholder. He requested a clear investigation. Then, witness Wang Qingwen testified that in August, the defendant used Mingji's name to sell Zhongyuan Boshan coal to Tongyi and Baotaishun factories, totaling more than 400 tons. After verifying the confession, Judge Zhang ordered the defendant to pay 5,000 yuan of silver and bail him out to await a further hearing on another date.</p>

<p>Questioning the Source and Destination of Serge Cloth</p>
<p>Sweet Soup Vendor's Child Cries Out in Distress</p>
<p>At 8 p.m. last night, near the south end of the Old Zha Gate Bridge, near the New Vegetable Market, a man resembling an old clerk from a business firm was pulling a handcart</p>
<p>loaded with more than a dozen pieces of serge cloth. When the nearby residents saw it, they immediately stepped forward to question the source of the goods and where they were being sent. The old clerk looked flustered and stammered. At this time, a young man dressed in a silk shirt next to him admitted that it was all his. Then, the audience began to condemn him, and disputes arose between them. Finally, the young man and the old clerk saw that the crowd was surging and difficult to resist, so they planned to break out of the encirclement and escape. At that time, a Chinese and Indian patrol happened to pass by and immediately telegraphed the Old Zha Gate Patrol Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to take all the people into the patrol station for interrogation. However, when the detectives arrived at the scene of the incident, all the onlookers scattered in a hubbub. A sweet soup vendor's stall parked outside the vegetable market was caught in the crossfire, causing all the bowls and dishes to be knocked over and smashed to pieces. The sweet soup was abandoned all over the ground. Although the child guarding the stall shouted and cried loudly, the panicked audience turned a deaf ear. As a result, the entire stall was destroyed, and the child had no way to complain, which was very pitiful.</p>

<h3 id="e149">New Building of the Municipal Ferry General Management Office Completed <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Address: Daotang Street, Qingning Temple Road, Pudong</p>
<p>The Municipal Ferry General Management Office was originally located in Donggou, in the remaining houses of the former Shanghai Pudong Tanggong Relief Bureau. It has been there for many years. Now, with the expansion of the ferry business, the number of employees has increased tenfold compared to when it was taken over. The location of the office is narrow, and both work and hygiene are greatly affected. Moreover, the address is remote, and it is inconvenient to contact. Therefore, the office rented the temple property behind Daotang Street in Qingning Temple, the midpoint of the ferry route, to build the office of the General Management Office and employee housing. It has recently been completed and moved in. It is said that the building is a three-story building with a total of twenty-eight rooms up and down, only a hundred steps away from the Qingning Temple Wharf, which is very convenient.</p>

This will allow people from Baoshan and other areas to take the city ferry from Wusong directly to the Shanghai Jinglu Bund, which is more convenient than taking land routes. The Wusong ferry schedule is as follows: (1) From Wusong: 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 1:30 PM, 3:30 PM, 5:30 PM; (2) From Shanghai: 7:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM.

<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, recognizing that the Boy Scout movement in China only extends to a portion of schools and that very few social organizations have Boy Scout troops, felt it necessary to promote this.

The union appointed Mr. Lin Shaosen as troop leader, and Messrs. Wang Dingchang, Wu Chuliang, Shen Fu, and Shen Shenping as trainers. The troop consisted of over fifty members. At the beginning of its formation, the Songhu Incident occurred.

It is reported that the troop has now been approved by the Chinese Boy Scout Headquarters and listed as the 642nd Troop of the Chinese Boy Scouts. The troop headquarters is located inside the Postal Workers' Union Club at 230 Laobazi Road.</p>

It is compiled in a thesis style, following the classification methods of English and American law. Famous figures in Chinese and foreign legal circles, such as Cai Yuanpei, British Chief Justice Lord Granton, and Chief Superintendent of the Public Works Department John S., have all written prefaces, praising it as an unprecedented work on current Chinese law in English.

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper's local news column of September 6, which published a "Truth about the Housing Dispute in Xincheng Lane", the matter is completely contrary to the truth. It was found that Gu Pingzhang is one of the defendants and has no right to blame this lawyer. The phrase "Article 2, Clause 2 of the Mediation Law" was mistakenly written as "Article 2, Clause 3" by the clerk drafting the pleading, which can be corrected by application. Subsequently, the court ordered an investigation by the Social Bureau into the facts of the mediation. This is the truth of the case. But the news reported that the mediation was rejected, but it is not known on what basis. As the matter concerns reputation, please publish a letter of correction.</p>

<p>Free Talk: How Should We Save the Country? 丨Free Talk Special Issue丨</p>
<h3 id="e173">Opening Remarks <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>—Juan</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, shocked by the May 9th Twenty-One Demands, I wrote a volume of "Diary of a Stateless Slave" (published by Zhonghua Book Company), in which I acted as a Korean-style stateless slave and tearfully described the tragic state of China after being destroyed by Japan. At the time, I said in the conclusion, "May this ideal forever remain an ideal." Who knew that on the night of September 18th last year, Japan suddenly invaded the Eastern Provinces, resulting in a year of various horrors and tragedies. My ideal from more than ten years ago seems to be gradually becoming a reality!</p>
<p>But although I have played the role of an ideal stateless slave, I do not want to be a real stateless slave. So I drew my sword and struck the ground, scratched my head and asked the sky, wandering around the room day and night, painfully thinking, "How should we save the country?" Unfortunately, I have the will to save the country, but lack the ability to reverse fate. After thinking hard for three days and three nights, I still couldn't come up with an effective plan. There was nothing I could do but borrow the pages of Free Talk to publicly solicit ideas. Within ten days, I received more than three hundred letters. Now, I will select some of the practical ones and disclose them. I hope everyone will act quickly and catch up, and work hard together on this great work of saving the country.</p>
<h3 id="e174">How Should We Save the Country? <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Mingsan</p>
<p>丨Better to Rely on Yourself Than on Others丨</p>
<p>The only thing in the world you can truly rely on is yourself. Seeking pity from others, seeking help from others, only leads to digging your own grave!</p>
<p>"Not afraid of a thousand arrows, only afraid of one heart," we should unite automatically, encourage each other, and discipline each other. We must know that "the backbone of the country is the warehouse of the collective power of the citizens."</p>
<p>Don't think that because you are "insignificant," you cannot save the country. Know that a diligent worker may be stronger than an important person who sleeps on a steel-spring bed and shouts for resistance.</p>
<p>We must "look far ahead and stand firm on the ground," identify a path, and walk forward with big steps. One day, there will be "an eye for an eye, and blood for blood" day!</p>
<p>The only object of saving the country right now is to increase wealth and intelligence. Student strikes and worker strikes reduce the source of national intelligence and the source of national productivity, both of which are unacceptable!</p>
<p>We must vow to never buy or sell enemy goods, and not to engage in any professional cooperation with enemies. Before we die, don't forget to leave a will to our descendants!</p>
<p>We should actively exercise our bodies. In peacetime, the body is a tool for work, and in wartime, it is a weapon for killing enemies. Sympathy and assistance are not empty words on paper and in mouths. We should practically help the "blood and ironless" volunteers in our Eastern Provinces!</p>
<h3 id="e175">My Suggestions for Saving the Country <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Qiantaisheng</p>
<p>丨Still Depends on the People丨</p>
<p>I have beaten a big gong and asked all the people, saying, "How should we save the country?" Their answers are all: shaking their heads, sighing, and saying, "There is no way!"</p>
<p>The so-called "sighing" of the people is just their way of expressing a passive approach. If we really want to save the country, isn't the greatest strength still in the people?</p>
<p>(1) Use Domestic Goods: Gandhi's naked body wearing Indian homespun is one such method. We don't have to wear British leather shoes, we have homemade cloth shoes; we don't have to eat "Beauty" brand ice cream, we can boil a cup of plain water; we don't have to wear imported yarns, we have Chinese homespun or silk. To go back 36,000 miles, cutting the electric light wire and lighting a vegetable oil lamp is not a shameful thing!</p>
<p>(2) National Salvation Fund: Donated voluntarily by the people to alleviate the country's current deficiencies. The funds are still kept by the people themselves, and their use is jointly managed by the people and the government, such as expanding military equipment, opening factories, reclaiming wasteland, and promoting industry.</p>
<p>(3) Compulsory Education: Investigate the school-age children across the country and send them to school compulsorily; for adults who have not received education, people's night schools should be promoted. The school's funding and preparations should be voluntarily created and supervised by the people!</p>
<p>(4) Conscription System: All people in the country should receive military training for a considerable number of years so that all people have military common sense; minors should also be forced to receive physical education. Make the whole country strong reserves, with only a small number of formal troops.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Two "Self" Methods for Saving the Country <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jieru</p>
<p>丨"Self" "From This Moment On"丨</p>
<p>To save China, we must first make China's economic organization sound and stable! In other words: on the one hand, we must produce as much as possible, and on the other hand, we must strive to save money. This is the strategy for saving China; it should also be a common goal recognized by those engaged in saving the country's work. To accomplish this goal, it is necessary for the entire nation to work together. However, the so-called "national strength" is a collection of individual strengths. The first problem of the Chinese people is: everyone is responsible for saving the country, but forgets themselves! Everyone does not do their best, and the strength of the nation cannot be born; the country cannot be saved!</p>
<p>Secondly, to accomplish this goal, it is necessary to have a long-term effort. However, "traveling far begins with the near." Ten or twenty years are linked together from one second and one minute. The second problem of the Chinese people is: recalling the past and hoping for the future, but neglecting the present. Following the old ways and sitting idle, the national situation will become increasingly dangerous and unsavable!</p>
<p>Therefore, if the work of saving the country is to have practical effects in the future, the Chinese people must abandon the two major problems mentioned above. Under the commonly recognized goals mentioned earlier, every person's "self" must "from this moment on" work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e177">Basic Work for National Salvation <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>丨Respectfully Propose Four Creeds丨</p>
<p>To still speak of national salvation today, the call for national salvation comes only from the mouths of a very few intellectuals, and yet we expect them to have practical solutions; putting pen to paper on this matter fills me with endless sorrow. This is not to sing high-sounding tunes or deliberately make alarming statements; it is because in China's current situation, those in positions of power are themselves unable to unite and disdain leading the masses; the masses, lacking strong organization, are at a loss as to how to save themselves, resulting in a state of fragmentation. Therefore, the most important task for national salvation today is to awaken the masses, rectify their ranks, strengthen their organization, each fulfilling their duties, each exerting their strength, striving to eliminate selfish desires and such bad habits as frivolity, obstinacy, and laziness, and only then can something be achieved. Here, I tentatively propose four creeds for basic national salvation work that everyone can do, to seek the wisdom of enlightened individuals and ask for their opinion on the matter:</p>
<p>Students, quickly read more books;</p>
<p>Merchants, above all, value integrity;</p>
<p>Farmers and workers, each do their best;</p>
<p>The entire nation must abstain from extravagance.</p>
<p>We, disregarding all adverse circumstances, not expecting guidance or assistance from the government, not aiming high or grand, but standing tall and each striving in basic work. The four creeds mentioned above are all easy to accomplish, and everyone can do them and easily achieve practical results. If even this is not desired or deemed worthy of doing, then everything else is empty talk and fantasy, and please do not speak of national salvation again!</p>
<h3 id="e178">National Salvation Methods That Everyone Can Do <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Shuang Hong</p>
<p>丨National Salvation Begins with the People Saving Themselves丨</p>
<p>Wake up! National salvation, national salvation, now is no longer the time to engage in empty theoretical talk! To save the nation, we must first start with the people saving themselves!</p>
<p>(1) Young students! Quickly strive to study diligently! Laboriously research academics! Stop staging the farce of expelling and beating up principals!</p>
<p>(2) Sacred workers! Concentrate on your work! Increasing your own production is increasing the nation's production! Unfortunate labor disputes, do not let them happen again!</p>
<p>(3) Industrialists and general merchants! Straighten your consciences, stop smuggling inferior goods to pass off as domestic goods!</p>
<p>(4) Modern girls! Stop spending your precious time on applying lipstick and mixing cosmetics! Put more effort into beneficial work! Those studying should concentrate on their studies, those managing household affairs should concentrate on household affairs, those with jobs should concentrate on their jobs.</p>
<p>(5) All other people! You do not really need to sleep on firewood and taste gall. In this era of national and social economic decline, let us all "save the nation through thrift"! If everyone can live thriftily with simple clothes and coarse food, it is guaranteed to be more effective than shouting "sleeping on firewood and tasting gall."</p>
<p>The above matters are things that everyone can do, and if everyone is determined to save themselves, then the "nation" will be "saved" without needing to be saved!</p>
<h3 id="e179">My Principles for National Salvation <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qian</p>
<p>丨A Total of Four丨</p>
<p>First, in everything, do not hold onto selfish and self-serving ideas. The concept of "selfishness and self-interest" is truly extremely prevalent in society. All corruption, fraud, perversion of justice, and dereliction of duty arise from the word "self." How can such people save the nation? National salvation must first mean "no self"!</p>
<p>Second, live a simple, plain, diligent, and hardworking life. Current living standards are truly making people more and more delicate. Food must be good to be palatable, houses must be good to be willing to live in. Good must be better, and scrutiny must be deeper. I ask, is this situation in line with China's current state? Can such people talk about national salvation? They are the same as selfish and self-serving people, and if they get a position, they will only desperately enrich themselves.</p>
<p>Third, do not use foreign goods. For all daily necessities, not only should we absolutely not buy enemy goods, but we should also try our best not to buy any foreign goods. When we love domestic goods, we can cultivate some vitality for national capital and suffer one less layer of exploitation by imperialists.</p>
<p>Fourth, strive to promote science. China suffers in everything because its fundamental material civilization is backward, especially in science and industry. Although new industries are gradually rising domestically now, in China, where there is no scientific foundation, it is like building a tower on sand, not very reliable. We, the educated, must each do our best in society to promote the awareness that the outside world is a world of science, that science should be loved, and that science should be respected, fathers exhorting their sons, elder brothers telling their younger brothers. If this kind of force is widely planted among the people, there will be countless engineers in the future, creating a solid industrial base.</p>
<p>Patriotic Novel</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Black Flag Army <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After the calamity, on the streets of S-port, colorful red lanterns, shops playing the tune of "Meng Jiangnü Seeking Her Husband" to attract customers, radio singing, everything was gone. Day and night, swaggering through the streets were either red-eyed, mad-looking J-nation army and navy, or J-nation ronin wearing tattered suits, so proud that they didn't know there were other nations in the world. They—from children to old women—had already seen the entire S-port as a soybean-sized grain! Moon-shaped flags were waving everywhere.</p>
<p>The retreat of the 32nd Army allowed the J-nation army to occupy S-port without any effort; hundreds of thousands of citizens immediately fell into the irrecoverable realm of being slaves of a conquered nation. The corpses of naked women were piled high in a large temple on Wuri Road. Gunshots rang out on the streets at any time. The life of every Chinese person was as worthless as a pebble.</p>
<p>This night, dark clouds shrouded the sky over S-port, and heavy rain poured down as if it were being dumped. The J-nation aircraft that had been flaunting their power in the blue sky all day had hidden without a trace; the J-nation sentries standing on the streets all hid behind telephone poles, trembling.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of engines whirred, dozens of white lights flashed in mid-air, and hundreds of pounds of bombs flew down continuously.</p>
<p>"Boom:: Boom::" The J-nation army's airport was destroyed, the headquarters was bombed, and the tank depot also caught fire! Countless J-nation army and navy soldiers, abandoning their armor and helmets, fled desperately in the heavy rain, pushing and shoving, yelling. The so-called might of the Imperial Army was swept away!</p>
<p>Then, from the northwest, a cannon fire that sounded distinctly different from ordinary artillery roared like a string of pearls! Main streets were filled with skirmishes between plainclothes team J-nation army and ronin. Hand grenades, machine guns, and mortars sounded denser and denser, and the fire stretched for seven or eight miles. The rain turned into oil, not only failing to extinguish the fire but increasing the flames.</p>
<p>Before dawn, the J-nation army on the northwestern front completely collapsed. Suddenly appearing, deep black, strange aircraft dropped heavy bombs on their heads in rows, destroying and burying them in teams. The tortures they had inflicted on the Chinese army a few days ago were now befalling them!</p>
<p>Outside Mazongkou, in the Qipu River, hundreds of steel-made small steamers also charged in, firing extremely fierce artillery fire, divided into several teams, and attacking the J-nation warships anchored there; flexible steel cables flew out from the small boats, hooking onto the sides of the warships, and many warriors carrying machine guns that were firing climbed onto the warships from the steel cables, and extremely powerful hand grenades were thrown from their hands.</p>
<p>This strange tactic immediately conquered warships weighing several thousand tons, and the navy was resolved! By afternoon, every J-nation person with a gun had become an unarmed prisoner. Hundreds of purely black fighter planes, after clearing out the enemy's air force, arranged themselves in four large characters in the sky, "Long Live China."</p>
<p>Chinese heroes wearing black military uniforms and holding black flags had driven out the enemy and taken back the entire S-port!</p>
<p>This was the great victory of the Black Flag Army, which had been trained for fifteen years and had never participated in a civil war.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Financial Gold Price Falls Five Taels <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuation Range Not Exceeding Three Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold resumed its downward trend. Although there were fluctuations, there were no special changes, and the range in the early and midday sessions was only about three taels. Later, it fell back five taels, a reaction to three consecutive days of rises. In short, people's minds are unsettled, making it difficult to predict. It opened lower, and although the silver market fell by one tael, the exchange rate saw the pound fall and the dollar rise, especially due to the large pullback of the US dollar. Afterwards, drafts seemed to loosen, and although there were short covering efforts, banks were still willing to sell, indicating that there were more suppliers on the surface, making it difficult to be optimistic about the price. At times, there were advances and retreats of one or two taels. Finally, it was calculated to be within thirteen taels. Now, Yingfeng Heng sold 210 bars of spot goods to the Central Bank at a price of fifteen and a half taels. Due to the weekend market closure and the chaotic conditions this week, the market went from weak to strong. The smallest price on Tuesday was 693.2 taels, influenced by the rise in overseas silver markets. Subsequently, it contracted again, and the local market also showed a profit, especially as the Central Bank absorbed cash aggressively, pushing the price up sharply. On Friday, it even reached 717.8 taels. Finally, it saw a slight reversal and fall. Comparing it to last Saturday, it continued to rise by 11.4 taels, with a total weekly increase of 24.6 taels. The following is a detailed record of yesterday morning's situation:</p>
<p>Market Sentiment Unable to Be Optimistic. It opened early with the October contract at 715.5 taels, down 2.1 taels. Large bars shrunk by 5/16, US silver shrunk by 1/4, and private telegrams fell by 5/16, but the local market was not good, and sellers were unwilling to let go. US cotton rose by more than ten points, so it opened lower. It then went to 15.8 taels, with fluctuations of a few cents. However, Shenkang took the lead in buying, but the selling was even stronger, causing the price to be unsustainable and fall by more than one tael to 14 taels. As for foreign exchange transactions, such as British gold at 19.4375 this month and US dollars at 31.5 yuan in December, both saw active trading. Subsequently, Bingxing, Yingfeng, and Heng bought in, and the price rose by more than one tael to 15.7 taels at just after 9:10. Then, Qianchangxiang and others came to sell, and at 9:30 it was at 14.23 taels. Yifeng, Yongyuanmao, and Yong and others sold, bringing it to 13.1 taels at nearly 10 o'clock. Later, due to differences in the cash flow of various firms, the price hovered around 14 taels. Then, Zhifeng Yong and others bought in, returning up two taels, reaching 15.1 taels at just after 10:20. Before long, Hongxing and Yongfeng and others all sold, bringing it to around 13.8 taels at around 10:40. Suddenly, there was a one-tael fluctuation, from 14.2 taels to 13.2 taels. At around 11 o'clock, there seemed to be more buyers, and it then rose to 14.3 taels. Afterwards, sellers were diligent, and Qianchangxiang, Yuanheng, and Hongxing and others tended to sell, causing sentiment to trend downwards, so the price fell downstream, dropping to 12.6 taels at just after 11:30. It was then bought in by retail investors, increasing slightly by five or six cents. After 11:45, there was only a difference of a few cents, and the cash flow of each firm was generally low. The market closed at 12.6 taels at noon, continuing to rise by one tael again because Hengxing suddenly bought more than 10,000 bars, reaching 13.56 taels. Compared to the previous day, it rose by five taels (in terms of listed prices). According to the calculation, the maximum was 15.8 taels in half a day and the minimum was 12.6 taels, a difference of 3.2 taels. Pure bars increased by 9.5 taels. The listed price quoted US dollars at 1.25, at 30.75 yuan, resulting in 780 taels, discounted by 66.7 taels, then 65 taels, and finally 67 taels, more than the previous day's discount of one tael. Account registration supplement was 13 taels.</p>
<p>Many Transaction Suppliers. On-screen transactions were still not uncommon. According to statistics, Dadecheng, Bingxing, Hengxing, Yingfengheng, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Hengxingyuan, Yifeng, and Hengchangyong all bought in. Hengyu, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, Zhifengyong, and Hongxing had quite a few ins and outs. Yuanmaoyong, Yuandayong, Qianchangxiang, Yuankangxiang, Hongkangyong, Yuanxingyong, Daxingyong, Yuanheng, Yifengyong, Yongfeng, and others all sold hedging. Commodity hedging saw busy ins and outs. The Dalian gang only had more than 200 bars in and out. The Guangdong gang bought in a total of more than 300 bars. As of the previous evening, the bar amount for each firm was more than 22,000 bars, a further decrease, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Exchange Market Turns From Stable to Loose <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the downward trend in the silver market did not stop, but the exchange rate trended differently, with the pound falling and the dollar rising. The Shanghai market reversed direction. HSBC's listed prices saw the US dollar increase by 1.25, and the French franc rose by one yuan. Hong Kong has not moved for many days and has now risen by 1.25, to 76.625 taels. The rest, such as British, Indian, German, and Singaporean currencies, were not changed. The actual trading prices of banks were initially stable, but seemed to loosen afterwards. Spot gold had fallen back after rising for three days, so noon closed compared to the previous night, with British gold increasing by 0.0625 and US dollars increasing by 1.25. Trading was active in various banks, with British gold trading at around 40,000 to 50,000 pounds. Gold firms slightly closed positions, and banks also made matching trades. US dollars saw a transaction of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, with various firms seeking to close positions. British and American banks had some mutual trading, and forward hedging left by more than 40 taels, but market conditions did not change excessively. The market was closed in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The intraday trading fluctuated by only 0.0625. The selling price for the current month was 1 shilling, 9 pence, 375; October, 4375; November, half a penny; December, 5625. The buying price was from 4375 to 625. The noon closing selling price was half a penny to 6875, and the buying price was 5625 to 75.</p>
<p>US Exchange: The intraday trading saw a difference of only 1.875. The difference between the current month and the November contract was 4.375. The selling price opened early for September at 31 yuan, October 125, November 3125, December 4375. The buying price was 125 to 5625. The noon closing selling price for the current month was 31.1875 yuan, October 3125, November half a yuan, December 625. The buying price was 3125 to 75, and the listed price was one yuan, equivalent to 3 taels, 2 qian, 5 fen, and 2.03, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Large Bars Increase by 1.875 <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 10th: Near and far large bars both increased by 1.875. The closing price was 18 pence 25 for the near term and 18 pence 375 for the far term. The British-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan, 4 jiao, 9 fen, 125.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Silver Transfers and Settlements Are Particularly Busy <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Silver Loans Still Weak: Foreign Interest Slightly Higher</p>
<p>Although yesterday was Saturday and banks were closed in the afternoon as usual, due to the large volume of incoming and outgoing goods payments, other related telegraphic transfers, documentary bills, and other payments naturally increased as well. As for the reason for the large number of goods payments, it is said that a certain type of foreign goods was imported in large quantities. Various businesses are gradually relaxing their attitudes towards the current situation outside, and various shops are successively releasing inventory rates to attract customers with this type of goods. As a result, the prosperity of imported goods seems to be ushering in a new era.</p>
<p>Interest Rates Rose Early and Weakened at Noon. The "foreign interest rate" was 6 qian, 9 fen, 1 li, 7 hao, and 5 hu in the early market, and 6 qian, 9 fen, 1 li, 6 hao, and 2 hu, 5 si in the noon market. As a result, it rose by 3 hao and 7 si, 5 hu compared to the previous day's noon market. "Silver loans" were both 4 fen in the early and noon markets, one fen better than the previous day. Due to the large number of check clearances, check clearing was generally done in white. Although the silver market situation was marked by busy inflows and outflows, the money industry was unwilling to release loans as much as possible, making it difficult to turn the tide.</p>
<p>In Subsidiary Currencies, Jiangnan Continued to Rise. Jiangnan small silver coins were 5 qian, 9 fen, 9 li and a half in the early market, 5 and a half li higher than the early market the previous day. The price was the same in the noon market. 8,000 jiao were transacted in the early market and 4,000 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small silver coins were 5 qian, 8 fen, 5 li, 1 hao and 2 hu, 5 si in the early market and 5 qian, 8 fen, 5 li, 3 hao and 7 hu, 5 si in the noon market, resulting in an increase of 2 hao and a half. 120,000 jiao were transacted in the early market and 35,000 jiao in the noon market.

<h3 id="e185">Securities Exchange to Reduce Margin Requirements <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Starting Next Week, 400 Yuan Each Will Be Charged for Principal and Special Securities</p>
<p>Prices Continued to Decline Slightly, with Transactions of More Than 1.6 Million</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange has seen very stable bond markets in recent months, with minimal daily fluctuations. Market business conditions are also not as good as before. In order to facilitate market investment and trading, it has been decided to reduce the special margin by 200 yuan, effective from next week. Therefore, next week's margin for each 10,000 yuan of futures trading will be 4 yuan each for the principal and special securities, totaling 800 yuan. As for yesterday's bond market conditions, spot trading was still scarce, with a total of only 8,000 yuan transacted. There was also only one type of futures transaction for the September contract, estimated at more than 1 million in the early session and only about 600,000 yuan in the afternoon, totaling 1.62 million yuan. Among them, downsizing, salt tax, and unified tax each accounted for more than 300,000, and the rest were still relatively sparse. The trend of various bonds also remained very sluggish, with only one or two corners changing between each session before and after. As a result, the market needs were extremely weak, a consistent slight contraction compared to the previous day, it is said.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on Friday (9th) remained weak. Because bulls had generally taken profits and closed out positions one after another, prices trended downward, and the results were slightly lower than the previous day. Trading activity saw a total of 40,000 shares transacted throughout the day. Looking at the overall stock market situation, it has clearly deviated far from the current and near-future industrial and commercial situation, and a reaction is to be expected. The Dow Jones Index for the 9th is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Transactions Increased to 508,850 Bales</p>
<p>Cotton yarn market conditions continue to move towards a soft path. Because US cotton fell sharply and then rebounded slightly, and bulls tended towards the short side, it was difficult for the market to recover, and a high-selling wind became even more intense, with heavy pressure. The current environment is harsh. As for actual demand, customers, seeing the futures yarn in raging waves, were all hesitant to move forward. However, Rongxing and others are still struggling vigorously. There are still major changes in the future, it is said.</p>
<p>Manchurian Bales Decline by Five, Six, and Seven Qian. The opening price of the Manchurian bales in the previous session saw US cotton rise, but most people believed that the strength was weak and the sellers' pressure was still heavy. Each month fell by three to five qian, and the situation was still dangerous. In the afternoon, it fell again by 1.3 qian, but the market sentiment felt slightly firmer at the close. The total transaction statistics for the day were 27,400 bales. According to the investigation, Dada sold 800 bales, Jifeng sold 750 bales, Changfeng sold 1,150 bales, and Yuantai sold 900 bales. Xincheng sold 600 bales and Ruida bought 650 bales. Shenji bought 700 bales, Yichang bought 1,700 bales, and Changfeng bought 1,000 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>November, 1509; Six, 97,450; Total, 508,850</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Deletion Still Sluggish. Spot yarn deletion is still sluggish. According to the investigation, the total purchased by all gangs throughout the day was only 445 bales, and the market was average. The purchase amounts of each party are listed below:</p>
<p>Fujian, 160; Guangdong, 15; Northern Gang, 5; Anqing, 10</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Transactions Increased to 1,319,700 piculs</p>
<p>The cotton market this morning was extremely weak. Although US cotton rose, most people believed that it was a small rebound after a big fall, and most floating longs had not yet been cleared out. Sellers seized the opportunity to pressure the market, which was still fluctuating. However, judging from the global cotton industry situation, the price of 32 to 33 taels is quite possible. However, a certain manufacturer is currently releasing about 160,000 piculs. At the time of the new cotton's market launch, foreign cotton was also weak. As a result, the sellers gained the upper hand and vigorously released with heavy pressure, so the market was erratic.</p>
<p>Zheng Bales Were Soft and Weak. The opening price of the Zheng Bales in the previous session saw the market sentiment still weak, and the selling pressure in the market was still intense. Each month fell by two to three qian. However, Yongan Factory bought about 60,000 to 70,000 piculs. Both the long and short sides were manufacturers with major changes in the future. The market situation was slightly firmer at the close in the afternoon, and each month rose by five cents to 2.5 qian. The total transaction statistics for the day were 92,000 piculs. According to the investigation, Dafeng sold 3,000 piculs, Yuanda sold 4,100 piculs, Renfeng sold 2,200 piculs, and Changfeng sold 2,600 piculs. Tongxing bought 4,400 piculs, Dafeng bought 2,600 piculs, Yichang bought 1,800 piculs, and Yuanda bought 2,200 piculs. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Bales; Closing Rise/Fall; Account Balance; One, 3290; Fall 10, 483,200</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was strong and active. It was strong initially due to good news from Liverpool, then softened due to selling by Japanese merchants. Futures rose by 16 to 19 points, and spot prices rose by 15 points. English cotton futures fell by 26-27 points, and spot prices fell by 72 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 70 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to speculative and brokerage selling, but then recovered due to buying by Japanese merchants. Bengals fell by 26 rupees, Oomras fell by 30.5 rupees, and Broach fell by 34 rupees. Recorded by telegraph (9th).</p>

<p>Market Price Plunges 105 Points</p>
<p>New York, September 9th telegram reports on the cotton market situation for the week: Reports of storms in Texas during the holiday, the strength of the Liverpool market, and forecasts of reduced cotton production caused raw cotton prices to rise. However, since yesterday's government report was released, large-scale liquidations have followed. According to this report, the expected new cotton harvest is slightly higher than previously anticipated. This is seen as a report that lowers market prices. As prices fell, traders bought in, and those who were short also actively covered their positions, but demand was not strong. Some believe that the cotton production estimate is 500,000 bales higher than forecast, and this estimate clearly has room for revision. In the future, after the revision, the cotton market will once again be dominated by optimism about the prospects for general trade. However, some also believe that buyers will be more cautious because they anticipate that hedging sales will increase when new cotton comes on the market more vigorously. At the same time, continuous reports of reduced cotton quality indicate that cotton crops have been developing poorly since September 1st. If the weather does not improve, the official report released in October will show even lower production figures. The weekend statistics are listed below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, there were still many boats arriving from various routes. Sales in this street were sluggish because the new *yangjian* rice was weak, and the old and broken *gong* rice also showed signs of weakness. The arrival of new *geng* rice was not large, and transactions became more active when the market opened. The arrival and sales of *xinhetan* rice were even. There were few shipments of early and late rice. Due to the sharp declines in recent days, top-quality rice saw some movement, and prices remained the same as before. New Gate: Yesterday, twenty-three or four boats arrived in *Xiang*. Most of them came from Jiangyin, Kunshan, Jiashan, and other areas. Urban and rural stores are selling because the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. It is the time for companies to settle accounts. The stockpiles of *Changxi Beigeng* and *Sutong* rice are still abundant, and people's sentiment is calm. The prices of new *geng*, new *du*, and *yangjian* rice have fallen by one or two *jiao*. There is not much stock of *tanbu jian* rice, and the price is slightly less than a *jiao*. However, the price of *bianyuan* rice has moved slightly, and the price has risen slightly more than a *jiao*.</p>

<p>Both North and South ports are handling shipments ::: This street is stagnant.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was in a stagnant situation. Because both the North and South groups were inquiring, although the quantity was not large, the market had become active, and people's sentiment was optimistic. However, there was still a lot of stock in the market, and the arrival of *hexiadu jian* rice caused the market price to fall. The price of foreign rice was dragged down by it. Yesterday, the sales on this street were stagnant. However, after the guest groups saw the Shanghai price recover slightly, it was feasible to handle transportation. The total daily transaction volume was 2,000 bags of small *jiaomi* rice, 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice, 300 bags of Siamese rice, and 80 bags of *Xiangmi* rice. Local businesses on this street only handle a small amount of small *jiaomi* rice. The rest is handled by the three major groups from the northern port of Yantai and the southern ports of Shantou and Xiamen. The price is firm.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Wheat Flour Futures Trading Turns Active <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Shandong group buys spot flour.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for various months stabilized. Because the prices of foreign wheat fluctuated by about one *jiao*, and because the gold price rebounded in recent days, the exchange rate narrowed. The major factories generally stood aside and did not offer prices, which stabilized people's sentiment and made trading slightly more active. The prices for various months were about five *li* higher than the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, people's sentiment became even more active because the Shandong group bought spot flour (Fuxin had no surplus and required prior registration). It was also rumored that Yutong's machine donations were suspended, and the U.S. government estimated a decrease in the wheat harvest. Due to these various reasons, the market atmosphere was stimulated. However, because rice prices are falling daily and flour is a supplementary food for the people, there is no hope of excessive price increases. As a result, the price for this month rose by 1.25 *fen*, October and November rose by 1.75 *fen*, December rose by 2 *fen*, January rose by 1.5 *fen*, and February rose by 1.75 *fen*.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally stable. Because the prices of foreign wheat did not fluctuate much, trading in various months was unusually quiet. Only this month was considered lively, while the rest only had one price because the wheat market seemed to lack orders. Without real goods, it is difficult for trading to develop. As a result, the price for this month was 1 *fen* higher than the previous day, October remained unchanged, November was slightly lower by 1 *fen*, December remained unchanged, January was higher by 1 *fen*, and February remained unchanged. The spot wheat market saw two periods of silence, with no trading taking place.</p>

<p>Sinfeng Foreign Firm reports: On Friday (September 9th), Chicago initially fell due to selling by Westerners, then rose due to good export demand. As a result, prices showed mixed increases and decreases compared to the previous day. The total daily trading volume was 40 million bushels. The market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price    Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September (Old Crop)    53.00    Up 0.125</p>
<p>September (New Crop)    52.75    Down 0.125</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stabilizing because the standard levy was stable and the Dutch exchange rate was rising. The guild’s set price for ordinary grade #24 coarse granulated white sugar was Tls. 14.45, while the purchasing price for the in-port was only Tls. 14.44, again resulting in a stalemate. The Exchange posted a price of Tls. 13.3 for over 60 packages of Huizhou white sugar from the Chaozhou group and Tls. 9.3 for dozens of crates of brick green sugar. Deliveries of refined ice sugar have been rare for some time. Upon investigation, Taikoo and NanNing’s imports had already received a batch of over 400 boxes, but because the landed costs are quite high, they have yet to convert.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Quiet <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was quiet because there were no overseas telegrams, and European and American firms were watching. Only the Gong'an firm imported 20 bales of Tongjun brand 13-15 denier Shanghai white factory silk at Tls. 665 per bale. The Huzhou factory imported 10 bales of Jinma brand 13-18 denier Shanghai white factory silk at Tls. 620 per bale.</p>
<p>In the last few days, various Yangtze River liners have imported 730 bales of yellow and white coarse silk shipped from Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Pingshui Group's Sales Active to America <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of Huzhou Pingshui green tea to American firms became active again. A major group, consisting of Jinlong Foreign Firm and China Tea Company, purchased over 5,000 cases. There were also scattered transactions in other varieties such as Pearl Tea and Needle Eyebrow. The market for green teas from the Lu Group and high-grade Mei teas from Tunxi and Sui'an was slightly more active, but sales of Wuyuan Guang goods remained stagnant.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Piece Goods: Woolen Fabrics Sales Surge <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market atmosphere at the Tongyi Guild for woolen fabrics was excellent. Transactions between buyers and sellers were frequent. Sales to local customers surged because the weather was cool and retail sales had started. Wholesale and retail business increased sharply, and all goods were active. Yesterday, substantial orders were placed for Walter Cloth, Serge, Raincoat Cloth, Melton, Overcoating, and Novelty Tweed, making the market very lively.</p>
<p>In addition, 200 cases of new woolen fabrics, including serge and tweed, arrived yesterday on the Sumori.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Metals: Lead Market Stable <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of metals was more active among the Changjiang gangs. The number of transactions was also higher. The northern groups of Tianjin, Yantai and Beiping were still buying less, although there were slight transactions by the Fujian groups, the amount was not large. Building trades in this street and odd-lot business also showed no improvement, so the market situation was quite scattered.</p>
<p>Overseas reports strengthen for lead. Recent telegrams from overseas indicate that lead is being offered at $47 per ton and that the market is very firm. It is reported that merchants from South Asia and India have purchased 500-600 tons, and domestic merchants here had previously purchased over 700 tons at around $44-45. Since they have not finalized those contracts, Shanghai standards are heard to be offered at Tls. 12.3. Therefore, the trend is still stable. After local Hunan lead rose with foreign lead, paint companies, yellow lead factories, and printing houses on this street have begun to purchase it. Therefore, the number of transactions has been strong in recent days, and the price is between Tls. 11.75 and 12 per picul.</p>
<p>British tinplate is set to ship 5,000 boxes. Trade in 90-pound British tinplate has been quite lively recently. The foreign price is in recent reports still very low, so merchants have placed orders to import 5,000 boxes at 14 shillings per box. Retail prices are at 14 shillings, 3-4 pence.</p>
<p>The offering price for new silver dollars is depressed. Since sales of new silver dollars have been sluggish in the North, shipments have been severely impacted. Business from southern merchants has not progressed much, and the market is quiet. The current market price is estimated at Tls. 4.75, and there are few buyers. However, it is found that merchants must import at around Tls. 5.5-5.6, so the price is almost a tael underwater.</p>
