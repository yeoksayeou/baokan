<h3 id="c1">日蘇果將不免於一戰乎彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日蘇關係之日趨惡化。旣已詳述如昨評。然而日蘇最近果將不免於一戰乎。吾人敢斷言曰［否｝。</p>
<p>吾人認爲欲判斷日蘇在最近之將來是否不免於一戰必先從整個世界之國際關係上作周密之分析與體認蓋日蘇之衝突。其眞實之主動者不僅爲日蘇自身。而尤在於整個資本主義系統下之列强换言之即日蘇之是否必至最後訴諸武力。不僅在於日蘇相互間之直接利害衝突。而實在於資本主義與社會主義之直接衝突。反蘇聯聯合戰綫之是否能得更進一步之堅固團結。乃爲判斷日蘇在最近之將來。是否必出於一戰之衝量</p>
<p>從另一方面觀之。自舊俄蛻化而爲蘇聯以後。資本主義國家之反蘇聯聯合戰線早已在彼此［心心相印］之情勢下形成。一九一八年之武力干涉與經清封鎖。即其具體表現。雖干涉與封鎖終歸失敗然而資本主義與社會主義尖銳之對立。則終始存在其相互間之仇怨。初不以干涉與封鎖之失敗而消滅。</p>
<p>就最近之情勢而觀。在歐洲。法國爲欲取得歐洲大陸之覇權。并防止蘇德之聯合。切實負起反蘇聯之主要任務。波蘭羅馬尼諸小國。由於法國之指揮。已締結軍事同盟。并以法國借欵而擴大武裝在蘇聯邊地積極建築軍用鐵道及軍用海港。羅馬尼亞在給予國聯之聲明書中曾公開承認其因爲與蘇聯相隣。不得不擴大武裝。更由於法國之主動波蘭與羅馬尼亞之軍隊都交由皮爾蘇斯基指揮。與蘇聯相隣各國之總參謀部舉行軍事會議在捷克斯拉夫。且已新創辦爲將來反蘇聯戰爭之兵工廠。法國之努力於反蘇聯戰爭之準備。吾人自可從而窺見。</p>
<p>再如太平洋彼方之美國。以蘇聯五年計劃之勝利。因而對於蘇聯。亦日益加强反對蘇聯之屯併政策。亦即其明證。至於在國聯會議中。在此次多腦河經濟會議中。其勾心鬥角。亦固無時或忘反蘇聯之一中心問題。九一八東北禍變突發。日本一方旣取得特别之權利。另一方面復在遠東負起反蘇聯之主要任務。實際上早已獲得國際間之默認與諒解。特别是法國。在事先不僅與日訂立密約。貸予鉅大借欵。即直至現在。仍熱烈同情於東北之佔領并公開鼓動戰事。自由報且主張『將西伯利亞之原野變爲消滅蘇聯之戰場』</p>
<p>由上述情形而觀。反蘇聯戰線之日益擴大蓋已爲極其顯然之事實而社會主義與資本主義之最後戰爭。此時亦已達到必然爆發之成熟時期。</p>

<p>吳氏演說吳經熊氏演說云、</p>
<p>略謂·義士蕭德上校之死、具有深遠之意義、蕭德義士所流之熱血、可作中美兩民族間之膠膝、且蕭德義士此次之努力、可代表古今中外之一切善勢力與惡勢力之抗衡、所以他雖死猶榮、雖殁猶存、我們今天一方面覺得非常哀悼、而一方面又覺對於蕭德義士擁護公道的精神非常羨慕、本來生死是宇宙間最普通的現象、有生必有列、也是很平淡無奇的事情、但是中國有句話、死有重於泰山、有輕於鴻毛、蕭德義士之死、可謂重於泰山者矣、今天義士之太夫人亦在塲、我們對於蕭太夫人、表示無限的敬仰、因爲他曾說、吾兒爲正義而死、雖死猶榮、這樣的豁達的觀念及大公無私的精神、實在使得我們五體投地、有其母必有其子、我們於此可見蕭義士之其來有自、現在擁護公道及抵禦强暴的工作尚未完全、人們還没有死的、更當盡後死者的責任、庶可告慰蕭義士於地下、我們自已的十九路軍忠勇衛國百折不撓、亦是發揚民族偉大的精神、蕭義士此次之犧牲、擬十九路之大無畏精神、可稱相得益彰、並埀不朽云、</p>
<p>殯儀一暼昨日下午二時三刻、宗敎儀式畢、即舉行出殯、儀仗甚盛、自慕爾堂出發、至靜安寺路、折向西、經過馬霍路·戈登路·西摩路·小沙渡路·哈同路·至大西路·虹橋路·而抵飛機塲、出發時、最先爲公共捕房之警備車及巡捕等、次爲載花圈之汽車、魚貫而行、共四十輛、再次爲靈柩、繼後爲蕭太夫人蕭弟愛德門李景綸夫人三人共乘一車、後乃爲執紼者、每四人列一排、前二排爲唐海安、俞鴻鈞·沈德夑·王志遠·林我將·鄭萊·郭德華等、餘爲旌表委員會人員、再後爲各團體代表、執紼者行至小涉渡路靜安寺路口、大多换乘汽車、赴虹橋飛機塲、餘則散去、當出殯時、沿途觀者如堵、約在十萬餘人以上、昨日殯儀、中國軍隊及工部局馬隊等、本擬參加、旋以種種關係、臨時作罷、</p>
<p>蕭母暈厥蕭太夫人來華後、</p>
<p>連日　鬰殊甚、致染微恙、昨日以義士出殯、太夫人勉强支持、親自參加、詎當靈車經過靜安寺路滄州飯店時、太夫人突然神智昏迷、當由義士令弟及親友等、扶入滄洲飯店、略事按摩、並飲藥水少許、太夫人乃清醒、當時愛特門君並義士親友、堅勸太夫人暫留滄洲飯店少息、不必親自送殯、惟太夫人愛子情殷、卒不顧、仍力疾參加、惟因此之故、靈車進行、爲此延遲十分鐘、</p>

<p>全上海的要友們、各界同胞們</p>
<p>八十年來的歷史告訴我們、帝國主義侵略我國愈加厲害、則我國資本家與帝國主義的關係愈加密切對工人的　削手段亦愈加殘酷、而工農勞苦同胞的生活、狀况、就更深一層的痛苦、此次時事新報資本家、有計劃的企圖摧殘我們報界工會的組織取消我們條件、而同時無故驅逐我們出館、正是日本帝國主義佔領上海、該報資本家乘機［下井投石］壓迫的事實表現本來現在中國的資産階级、已經絲毫没有反抗帝國主義的决心、而只有靠　削工人的汗血、以苟延殘喘的卑鄙手段、</p>
<p>當［一二八］暴日進兵閘北、十九路軍弟兄自動抗戰、全國同胞齊心反日之時、在此炮火彈雨之下、我們不顧我們自已生命代資本家加緊工作的時候、乃時事新報資本家忘了我們勞苦工人的代他效勞、竟别个心腸、不計劃反日、而計劃進攻我們工人、始則强迫我們於每日經常工作以外、加做［號外］全體一百餘人、每日僅給工資十三元半、（須由八十餘工友分派）我們當時以正在反日戰爭中又處在［停版解雇］威嚇之下、更風聞資方已經雇有北方工友若干人、在某西報練習、來準備破壞我們組織、故雖吸知此舉是向我們威脅挑　、當時爲避免中計、只得忍痛</p>
<p>接受、資本家見陰謀挑　不遂、乃施用第二步公開進攻手段、於本月二日、不經工會同意、擅自勾結極少數主腦工賊、令我們承印大晚報、我們即以未得工會命令、不便接受、婉言謝絕、乃資本家竟於次日向我們無故提出（一）退出工會（破壞工會組織）（二）取消勞資條件、（　奪一切已得利益）（三）不得干涉館方行政、（讓資本家隨便壓迫不准反對）（四）開除工友張保康等四項條件、聲色俱厲的强迫我們承認、我們還没有接受或拒絕表示時、資本家的走狗、居然將我工會張委員加以毆辱、並將全體工友逐出工塲、加以封鎖、一面控告捕房指爲罷工、加以逮捕、我們被迫離館了、資本家即另僱代價極低的新工工作、一面復由資本家的走狗、拿手槍恐嚇拘捕我們八個工友、在館内私自監禁起來、一面并利誘少數走狗、離間工友團結、扳起閻王面孔、始終拒絕我們上工、這樣威逼利誘雙管齊下的來置我們於死地、</p>
<p>我們現在知道了、資本家態度這樣强硬、正是我們手段軟弱、希望和平解决的結果、本來這次時事新報資本家的壓迫我們、正是破壞整個報界工會組織、和　奪報界工人已得一切利益、加重壓迫報界工人的開始、同時又是最近帝國主義勢力在中國更擴大、中外資本家一齊向工人進攻中的起首、這樣的進攻、整個報館工人和全國工人、决不是小問題、更不是保守或孤軍獨戰所能取勝、只有聯合全報界工人和全上海被壓迫工人一齊聯絡起來、向這種毫無肝腸的資本家反攻和進攻、才能冲破目前難關、</p>
<p>工友們、時機緊張了、資本家一致加緊向我們進攻了、尤其是時事新報資本家這種無事的壓迫、更具體表現出來了、我們爲維持自已的生活、不願凍死、餓死、我們爲保障整個工會的組織和利益、不願被資本家各個擊破、所以我們　必堅决奮鬥、不達目的、决不干休、但是當此中外資本家一齊向工友進攻中、衹是我們時事新報工友的力量來反攻、還覺得單薄、我們急切希望全上海的工友們、勞苦同胞們、本階级相同、利害相共的立塲、一致起來援助我們、起來、大家一致聯合起來、爲反抗壓迫解放痛苦共同奮鬥、限令時事新報資本家在最短期内、答覆工友的一切要求、（一）立即恢復四月二日以前之狀態、（二）反對塡寫志願書、（三）離館期内工資照給、（時事新報館方向報界工會道歉、我們的口號、（一）反對破壞工運的時事新報資本家、（二）打倒工賊走狗、（三）全上海被壓迫的工人聯合起來、（四）全國同胞一致起來、與這不顧公事的時事新報、永遠斷絕關係、時事新報被迫離館全體工友啓、</p>

<p>第五回負義絕交不幸招逢豪客怒關情定策最難消受美人恩若是那些尋常的小竿盜匪。眞要不量力的找上門來尋　是准能殺他一個落花流水。使他們知道安家寨利害非常。不是好惹的呢。不過武力雖不能不備。盜匪也不可不防。郤又不能專仗著好勇鬬狠。以力服人。與他們這般愍不畏死的惡徒。結不那勢不兩立的深仇大恨。於是也得稍事圓通。從化敵爲友上做些工夫。不妨在暗中仍和他們講講交情。通通聲氣。只要以後能夠保得住兩不相犯。就是按年按節多少送他們一點禮金。或另給與一種對於官府上袒護隠飾的便利。也没有什麽不可。好在地方绅士們窩藏匪類。以及良民與盜匪抗　一氣的怪現像。那時是久已通行。而好漢們高喊着兎子不吃窩邊草的口號。自也樂於賣這個順水人情。倒落得公平交易。相安無事。這其中出力拉縴的一人。便就是安玉田的堂叔安大奎。他家長輩的大排行。安大成是老大。安大奎是老三。另還有位二大爺。早就去世了。只剩下一個小兒子。又同時没有了娘。便由安大成老夫婦帶到身邊。把姪子當做親生兒子般看待。那也就是安玉田的小兄弟安玉源。這位安大奎從小在家裏讀書不成。專喜與一般鄉里中流氓無賴交游。居然就認識那個著名匪首牛黑風。那牛黑風生長在隣縣不遠的地方。十幾歲就在土匪淘裏厮混。後來投誠了兩次。正式軍官也做過兩回。地位便逐漸增高。到了第三次又依然　變爲匪。拐着了許多槍。裏脅了許多人。就一躍而爲最大的竿子頭。安大奎是我想混一碗界軍飯吃。大概在牛黑風投誠當軍官的時代。彼此把交情聯絡上。并還一道兒磕過頭。拜過把子。結爲異姓兄弟。及牛黑風重操匪業。安大奎雖没曾跟他同上山去。但不斷的尚有信使往來。互通聲息。故此牛黑風念在這點交情上。對安家寨是從來絕不騷擾。安大成因兄弟的介紹。與牛黑風也曾見過面。并很贊成安大奎這種舉動。願和牛黑風保持相當的友誼。近年安大奎得着旁的機會。出門去另幹着一分軍界的差事。恰巧那個機關裏所隷屬的一支軍隊。開到距離安家寨三十餘里另一處小鎭市來駐防。</p>

<p>— 垢</p>
<p>昨見報載［漙儀長妹二格韞龢與鄭　孝胥孫遺凱，於十八日午後一時，在長春結婚，照前清舊制舉行，是日午前十一時，新郎着前清朝衣朝帽，隨其叔父鄭垂，同僞執政府所派待從四人引導，依舊制宣誓，並由漙儀取白絲巾一方，署名蓋章其上，禮畢，午後二時，新郎新婦歸宅，云云，</p>
<p>靑年男女結婚，本來算不了一椿奇事，但是溥儀的妹妹與鄭孝胥的孫子結婚，到有一些兒意味，就算我今天的一個題目，那來談談，溥儀與鄭孝胥輩一般狐羣狗黨，誰也不知是日人的走狗，我國的叛徒，僞滿洲的新組織，原是傀儡登場的一幕活劇，風流天子，居然活像一個風流天子，奸賊國舅，居然活現一個奸賊國舅，但到後面去看看，完全由一個人在幕後牽綫，這種木頭人，還自鳴得意地在臺上舞蹈呢，</p>
<p>現在大把戲之外，又串了齣小把戲，溥儀的長妹二格韞龢，已下嫁了鄭孝胥的孫子遺凱，若照這樣算來，曾經吃過日人大耳括子的鄭孝胥，居然是僞滿洲國的老國舅了，曾經嘗過日人槍柄滋味的鄭垂，居然是僞滿洲國的國舅了，不成材的鄭遺凱，居然是僞滿洲國的驓馬了，［一門權貴，與國同休，一今日的鄭孝胥，可謂炙手可熱，榮極一時，可還了得麽，</p>
<p>前日僞滿洲國活劇開幕的時候，溥儀名爲執政，鄭孝胥却是用三跪九叩首的皇帝體制來朝見溥儀，我當時就笑這個老頭兒，爲什麽違反世界的潮流，偏要跟着宣老統去主張復辟，及至傀儡登塲，方知鄭孝胥二十年來没有爽爽快快磕過響頭，有些難過，現在有了磕頭之所，豈不是稱心滿意麽，此次遺凱和韞龢結婚，想必又是一個磕頭機會到了，因爲皇妹下嫁奴才，必定要三跪九叩首去重重謝恩呢，</p>
<p>不過有兩點要請鄭君注意，現在東北的僞組織，非但我國不能承認，即各國也不肯承認，這一點還不要緊，現在暫時［關門改年號］的去串罷，還有一點須要謹防的，就是巨靈之掌，和日本來路貨的槍柄滋味，</p>

<p>— 乃徴</p>
<p>陸地上戰爭的防守，尚可繞置連綿數百里的鐵絲網，或再堆疊沙袋，掘築堅深的壕溝，埋藏地雷；衝鋒的骑兵步兵，未近先死。即坦克車疾馳而來，亦難能衝過。水上的防守，亦可在海岸口處佈置電網，埋沉水當，防阻敵軍艦與　水艇魚雷等，但在空中，則面積極大，高空不可計算，以致防不勝防，且難能防，飛機即可佔此便宜、居高向下，擲彈破壞防禦物，掩護自己騎兵或步兵衝鋒·故近來各國皆在擴充空軍，而我國張學良將軍，於民國二十年九月十八日，獨以飛機二百餘架，惠贈給日本·飛機在戰爭上的用途不同，所以可分爲爆炸飛機，戰鬭飛機，偵察飛機三種，今分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）爆炸飛機在三種中爲最大，旣能載重，又可以長時間的飛行空中。機身内可裝輕砲，機關槍，與炸彈等，所擲炸彈的重量，有半噸至一噸的重，一噸等於二千磅）但平常用的炸彈，約一百十磅至二百二十磅，則更可多帶炸彈，牠非但用來爆炸，並且可以作遠路的偵察。普通爆炸飛機，自頭至尾，有四十六英尺長，十六英尺高。上升可飛至一萬五千七百四十八尺，在十分鐘内即可升到六千五百六十餘尺。可連續不繼的航行九十小時。牠的速率（Ｓｐｅｅｄ）</p>
<p>是每小時僅三十英里。自身的重量則有五噸，所以牠飛行甚遲，再裝載重量的炸彈等物，則行動轉向更笨遲。我們看見日爆炸機先遲遲的盤數圈乃擲彈，即因牠笨遲，難對準目的物。牠易爲戰鬭機追着射擊，故亦裝置機關槍，以便對抗，但戰鬭機的玲瓏活潑，决非牠能及，故爆炸機必有一二戰鬬機在旁保護，纔敢出來擲彈。此次眞茹擊落的，即日本的爆炸機。</p>
<p>（二）戰鬬機比爆炸機小得多，有單坐位，雙位等數種·飛行極活靈，非常的便利於戰鬬。最新式的單坐位戰鬬機，裝置輕機關槍共六架，頭上二架·左右各兩架，加彈開放，手續甚便。通常的約十八餘英尺長·十六尺高。可飛升至二萬五千七百餘尺。但至如此之高·空中養氣稀少，司機者必須備人造養氣呼吸器。在五分鐘内即能升到六千五百餘尺，比爆炸機升高快一半·速率每小時一百五十英里·重僅一噸餘，但繼續飛行祗能二三小時。爲人類正義而死的美國飛行家孝脫（ＬieutbohShort)上尉，聞即駕單座戰鬬機，與日機六架射擊的蘇州的空中。尚有一種疊座戰鬬機，則一人專駕機，一人手中携輕機關槍，能任意向四方射擊，且又能向上下開放，向下時子彈如雨點一般的落下·</p>
<p>（三）偵察機能偵察敵方行動·用無線電報告自已軍隊·又賴近世攝影機的精良，在數千尺高的飛機上，也能向地面上攝取極清晰的敵軍，且再能放大，更便考察，以調算攻守。蔣馮在隴海鐵路一戰上，中央航空軍隊偵察機，曾攝馮軍佈防情形的照片，余嘗在某雜誌上見過，雖已重印於纸上，然仍清晰，戰壕的彎曲·人馬的多少，礮位的遠近，歷歷在目·蔣軍大勝，即因有了偵察機。至於牠的大小速率高度與戰鬬機錯不多。且亦可裝置機關槍，或携帶炸彈。有一種器具攻，必有一種防·飛機用於戰爭上後，即發明高射礮防之。高</p>
<p>射礮能任意轉换方向，在一秒鐘内可發多量的子彈·又能裝載在汽車上，追射飛機。</p>
<p>近世無線電的猛進，飛機在高空中飛行，可不用人駕御，籍無線電力控制飛機，使牠前進後退，升高下降·其擲彈的猛烈，偵察的清晰，較人駕駛，更爲便利而有力·又有一種特别猛烈的［光］發明，空中的飛機，若給一條白光照着·立即燒成焦炭，若儲帶火藥炸彈·則更炸烈飛散消滅無遺·誠令人驚心動魂·但此種軍事發明，各國皆嚴守秘密，尚在進一步的研究中，而我國亦有所發明，嚴守秘密，尚在研究中乎？</p>

<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>江灣大學在此次戰變中，無辜化爲灰燼，這樣關於文化損害的一回傷心事，想大家尚未健忘吧！</p>
<p>Ｒ君在那江灣一役的前兩天，終算脫險；暫時避難在租界上的一位親戚家，</p>
<p>最近得到大學移在安全地帶開學消息，Ｒ君一面固然是歡喜，一面又愁學費的來源，因爲家信早已隔絕，經濟毫無辦法之故，打算了一個通霄，只得硬着頭皮向他的親戚借到一條嶄新的俄國絨氈，和·····Ｒ君狠高興的浮着一個念望，這樣好的一條絨氈，至少可當十塊錢，除缴學費十八元，登記一元，還有另用·····不覺就踏進了當店</p>
<p>門，</p>
<p>店主把它翻來復去地仔細看了後，轉臉向Ｒ君說··［這條絨氈當三塊錢，怎樣！］要［當十塊錢］，Ｒ君帶着驚駭而有些乞憐的聲色說，</p>
<p>哈，哈，當不到，當不到，</p>
<p>老闆，請你勿要弄錯，這條絨氈的確在哈爾濱三十四塊錢買來的，並且用了没多時，因爲短少學費，才肯輕輕把它當掉，實出無奈，</p>
<p>哼！你個人倒奇怪，我吃了這碗典當飯，足足十六年，什麽弄錯不弄錯。老實說，你拿金鋼鑽，珠子，寳石，也</p>
<p>不在我眼下，只値三塊洋，</p>
<p>唉！對不住，請你······</p>
<p>······那有什麽對不住，不當拉倒，加點可以嗎？老闆！原諒我，那末，加你四只八開，請你······請你·····對不住，在這時局不靖的當兒，我們最好······你若不願把它當，走···走···走</p>
<p>噢！算了，當吧，當吧！</p>
<p>不知不覺夕陽西下，肚皮倒是咕嚕嚕的響，Ｒ君好像和肚子鬬氣似的置之不理，老是想着明天是學校繳費限期的最後］日了！但是不夠數的這幾元學費怎樣解决？唉！典當老闆啊，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Will There Be a Japanese-Soviet War in the Near Future? <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The increasingly deteriorating relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has already been described in detail in yesterday’s commentary. However, will Japan and the Soviet Union inevitably engage in war in the near future? We dare to assert: [No].</p>
<p>We believe that in order to judge whether a war between Japan and the Soviet Union is inevitable in the near future, a thorough analysis and understanding of the entire world's international relations is essential. The true initiator of the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union is not only Japan and the Soviet Union themselves, but also the major powers within the entire capitalist system. In other words, whether Japan and the Soviet Union will inevitably resort to force in the end depends not only on the direct conflict of interests between Japan and the Soviet Union, but also on the direct conflict between capitalism and socialism. Whether the anti-Soviet united front can achieve further solid unity is the key to judging whether Japan and the Soviet Union will inevitably engage in war in the near future.</p>
<p>From another perspective, since the transformation of old Russia into the Soviet Union, capitalist countries have long formed an anti-Soviet united front under the circumstance of mutual understanding. The military intervention and economic blockade of 1918 were concrete manifestations of this. Although intervention and blockade ultimately failed, the sharp opposition between capitalism and socialism has always existed. The mutual hatred between them did not disappear with the failure of intervention and blockade.</p>
<p>Looking at the recent situation, in Europe, France, in order to obtain hegemony on the European continent and prevent the union of Germany and the Soviet Union, has earnestly taken on the main task of opposing the Soviet Union. Small countries such as Poland and Romania have concluded military alliances under the command of France, and have expanded their armaments with French loans, actively constructing military railways and military seaports in the border areas of the Soviet Union. Romania openly admitted in a statement to the League of Nations that it had to expand its armaments because it was adjacent to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, under the initiative of France, the troops of Poland and Romania were placed under the command of Piłsudski. The general staff departments of countries adjacent to the Soviet Union held military meetings. In Czechoslovakia, a new armory has been established for future anti-Soviet wars. We can glean France's efforts in preparing for an anti-Soviet war.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the United States, across the Pacific, has also increasingly strengthened its opposition to the Soviet Union's annexation policy due to the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan. This is also clear evidence. As for the meetings of the League of Nations, and the recent Danube Economic Conference, the central issue of anti-Soviet sentiment has never been forgotten in their machinations. After the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, Japan not only gained special rights, but also assumed the main task of opposing the Soviet Union in the Far East. In practice, it has long gained tacit recognition and understanding from the international community. France in particular, not only concluded a secret agreement with Japan in advance and granted huge loans, but even now, still warmly sympathizes with the occupation of the Northeast and openly encourages war. The newspaper *Liberté* even advocated "turning the wilderness of Siberia into a battlefield for destroying the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Judging from the above situation, the increasing expansion of the anti-Soviet front is already an extremely obvious fact, and the final war between socialism and capitalism has reached a mature stage where it is bound to erupt.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The League of Nations Cannot Handle the Shanghai Incident <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Chief Delegate Requests for Maximum Delay</p>
<p>Delegates of Small Countries Demand Resolute Action</p>
<p>Chinese Delegate Asks for Prompt Convening of a Special Meeting</p>
<p>Chairman Hymans Makes Optimistic Remarks with Reluctance</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 24th—The question on everyone’s lips in Geneva today is, “How long can Mr. Hymans (Chairman of the Committee of Nineteen) hold back the majority of the committee, forcing them to remain silent, and preventing them from demanding resolute action to deal with the Shanghai Incident?” The Japanese Chief Delegate, Nagaoka, is now exerting every effort to lobby the various committee members and has formally requested Hymans to delay matters as much as possible, as instructions from Tokyo have not yet arrived this morning. Representatives of the smaller nations, however, have reached the end of their tether and are now holding meetings amongst themselves. A Reuters correspondent has learned that a call for prompt and resolute action is clearly gathering momentum, with a number of representatives openly stating that they are unable to understand the reasons for the delay, as the draft resolution of the Special Committee, which is the subject of the current dispute, was approved by Japan before it was drawn up. However, a spokesman for the Japanese delegation, while admitting that Hymans had consulted the Japanese delegation at the time, said that the delegation was unaware of the contents of Article 11 of the resolution due to a misunderstanding. The attitude of the smaller nations on the issue of a withdrawal deadline is now clearly hardening, with the general consensus being that some kind of compromise on this important clause may be possible, but that both parties must accept the decisions of a neutral party. If a consensus agreement cannot be reached immediately, a full meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly should be convened as soon as possible (this meeting had previously been scheduled for May 1), so that the matter can be handled in accordance with Sections 4 and 10 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. The Chinese delegation has requested Hymans to convene a meeting of the Special Committee as soon as possible. Hymans replied that the meeting may be held on Tuesday. British Foreign Secretary Simon had flown back to London this afternoon for personal matters and will return here on Tuesday. If he is unable to attend on that day, he will be replaced by the British Air Minister, Londonderry. However, it is unlikely that the Special Committee will be able to convene on that day. Reuters, Geneva, 23rd—Chairman Hymans of the Committee of Nineteen today spoke to reporters, striking an optimistic tone on the outcome of the Far East negotiations, saying that all parties were now working hard to bring China and Japan closer together and that he believed the dispute between the two countries could eventually be resolved satisfactorily. Dentsu, Tokyo, 24th—In order to prevent Japan from withdrawing from the League of Nations, the League of Nations Secretariat, the core body, is accommodating Japan's demands on Article 11 of the Committee of Nineteen's resolution, which concerns the powers of the Mixed Committee, and has drafted an amendment, asking Japan to compromise. The Japanese Delegate, Nagaoka, immediately consulted Foreign Minister Yoshizawa on the matter. Although the contents are being kept strictly secret, it is nothing more than how Article 11 of the resolution can be changed to reach a compromise with the Japanese government. Yesterday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry consulted and discussed this point with the Army and Navy authorities, and the results are as follows: (1) The Mixed Committee's resolutions, no matter what they may be, must be unanimous. If a compromise is rashly reached, the agreement reached in Shanghai will inevitably be changed, which is absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, a more appropriate method should be sought. The final attitude will be decided after Foreign Minister Yoshizawa consults with the heads of government. (2) The Mixed Committee's authority to determine and declare the timing of the withdrawal of Japanese troops should be removed and they should only be allowed to offer opinions. Japan should retain the freedom to carry out the withdrawal. However, the Japanese government's reply is likely to be delayed by a day or two.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Troops Challenge Our Forces at Wangjiazhai, Taicang <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Changshu, 24th—At 8:00 AM this morning, more than one hundred enemy troops at Wangjiazhai, one li east of Hongmiao in Taicang, challenged our forces, and the sound of gunfire was very dense for a while. Our troops calmly responded to the battle. Half an hour later, the enemy was routed, and the number of casualties is unknown. At 10:00 AM, the enemy reinforced with another 300 troops, but did not join the battle. Yesterday, our troops in Taicang captured two enemy officers in Hongmiao and escorted them to Taicheng. One of them committed suicide on the way. The enemy stationed in Loutang is said to be part of the First Division, and their equipment is very sophisticated. The Korean soldiers stationed in Luduqiao and Liuhe call themselves the Korean Border Army. Four warships arrived in Liuhe yesterday, transporting a large amount of military supplies, which were transferred to Loutang today. Currently, enemy warships are paying attention to Taicang, and five or six aircraft fly to and from the urban area every day to conduct reconnaissance.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Recent Situation of the Frontline Japanese Troops <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Suzhou, 24th—On the 24th, more than ten enemy floating corpses were found in Xinmuqiao River, Taicang. All of them wore symbols with the four characters "May Heaven Bless You" written on them, as well as more than ten graphic symbols. Dozens of civilian houses in the area of Liuhe, Hong Wanzhen, etc., were burned down by the enemy on the 23rd. Wu Zhongji, Zhu Deren, and others were looted empty, with a total loss of more than 100,000 yuan. The enemy in Liuhe has also transferred more than 2,000 new troops, stationed in Tanggongju, Huashang Hotel, Shao Hesheng, Xiang Huiqing, Chen Jingxiang, Zhu Qishan, Huang.</p>
<p>Xiusheng, and various places. More than fifty enemy troops arrived in Zhangjingqiao on the 24th and stayed in Zhu Qingcao's garden. On the morning of the 24th, a sentinel battle broke out more than 30 li northeast of Kunshan, lasting two hours. The enemy</p>
<p>Withdrew. Only the eastern side of Xintang City is passable, while the south, west, and north sides are all cut off. Currently, there are more than 300 enemy troops, who carry machine guns and rifles every day and open fire arbitrarily to show their strength. On the 24th, the Japanese headquarters in Xintang City sent more than 20 sentries to patrol the area of Pailou City.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Entire City Flies Half-Mast Flags for the Funeral of Xiao De Yesterday <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Military Funeral Held at Hongqiao Airport</p>
<p>Thousands of People Hold Funeral Ropes, 100,000 Spectators</p>
<p>Pilots Carry the Coffin with Utmost Honor and Sorrow</p>
<p>Colonel Xiao De, an American aviator, sacrificed himself for human justice and world peace, and people all over the world mourned him unanimously. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the funeral procession departed from Moore Memorial Church and a military funeral was held at Hongqiao Airport in western Shanghai. The entire city flew half-mast flags. Thousands of people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, attended the funeral, and the streets were packed with spectators. The ceremony was solemn and mournful, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. At that time, the sky was suddenly covered with melancholy clouds and rain poured down, adding to the bleakness of the scene. Wu Tiecheng, Tang Hai'an, Shen Dexie, and others walked in the funeral procession. Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, Chiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, and Qu Shounian all presented wreaths, which can be described as the ultimate in honor and sorrow. The righteous man, if he knows, should also smile in the netherworld. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Morning Memorial Ceremony: Before his death, the righteous man Xiao De was a member of the World Brotherhood Association, ranking 32nd in the association. The association members mourned him with utmost grief upon learning of his martyrdom. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, a religious ceremony was held by 34 fellow members according to the association's funeral rites. Before the ceremony began, the righteous man's younger brother, Mr. Edward, went to the Universal Funeral Home at about 8:00 AM to inspect the preparations for half an hour before returning to the Cathay Hotel. At 9:45 AM, he accompanied Mrs. Xiao and several female relatives and friends.</p>
<p>To attend the ceremony. Yesterday, Mrs. Xiao's car was the one usually provided by the American company, Madie, for the American ambassador to ride in. Yesterday, it was temporarily borrowed for Mrs. Xiao to ride in. After Mrs. Xiao and others arrived at the funeral home, Mr. Edward and many relatives and friends stopped behind the coffin, while Mrs. Xiao sat in the guest seat, crying sadly. At exactly 10:00 AM, 34 members of the association arrived in a line, surrounding the coffin and reciting the Bible. The costumes worn by the members were very distinctive. Among the Chinese participants were Mr. Niu Huisheng, Mr. He Tingran, Mr. Mei Huaquan, and others. The recitation lasted for three quarters of an hour. After each recitation, a member kissed the cross flower on the coffin. At the end, a member knocked on the coffin and shouted, "My brother, can you answer?" The atmosphere was extremely solemn. At 11:45 AM, the ceremony ended and the members presented flowers one by one and filed out. Mrs. Xiao and others also returned to their residence. Relocation of the Coffin: The righteous man Xiao's coffin was moved from the Universal Funeral Home to Moore Memorial Church at 12:30 PM yesterday. When the coffin was moved, the Aviation Administration's representative, Director Shen Dexie, led the sixth squadron pilots, Yu Zhengping, Tan Sujing, Long Rongxuan, Peng Qingchang, and the American pilots Van Han, Shelley, Harding, and Westall, and Aviation School instructor He Jian, a total of eight people, carried the righteous man's coffin out of the mortuary and placed it in the black hearse prepared by the funeral home.

<p>Memorial Service: The memorial service was held at 2:00 PM yesterday. The military band of the Public Security Bureau first played mournful music, followed by a prayer by Pastor Fiche, hymns sung by various clergymen, Pastor Fiche reading the Bible again (Luke Chapter 14), Du Tingxiu reading hymns, Zheng Lai representing Song Ziwen reading the memorial oration, Wu Jingxiong delivering a speech on behalf of the people, and clergymen singing hymns. The ceremony ended at 2:40 PM. During the ceremony, Xiao's mother sat at the north end of the coffin, sobbing uncontrollably. Xiao's younger brother was even more grief-stricken. Many of the guests were also saddened. After the ceremony, eight Chinese and American pilots carried the coffin out of Moore Memorial Church.</p>
<p>Wu's Speech: Wu Jingxiong said in his speech:</p>
<p>Briefly stated, the death of the righteous man Colonel Xiao De has far-reaching significance. The blood shed by the righteous man Xiao De can serve as the glue between the Chinese and American nations. Furthermore, the efforts of the righteous man Xiao De this time can represent the confrontation between all good and evil forces in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Therefore, although he died, he is still honored, and although he is gone, he still exists. We feel very sad on the one hand today, and on the other hand, we admire the spirit of the righteous man Xiao De who upholds justice. Originally, life and death are the most common phenomena in the universe, and there must be a row after life, which is also very ordinary and unremarkable. However, there is a Chinese saying that death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. The death of the righteous man Xiao De can be said to be heavier than Mount Tai. Today, the righteous man's mother is also present. We express our infinite respect for Mrs. Xiao, because she once said, "My son died for justice, and although he died, he is still honored." Such an open-minded concept and selfless spirit really make us prostrate ourselves. There must be a reason for such a son, and we can see that the righteous man Xiao De has his origins. Now, the work of upholding justice and resisting tyranny has not yet been completed. People who have not yet died should fulfill the responsibilities of those who die later, so that they can comfort the righteous man Xiao De in the ground. Our own 19th Route Army is loyal, courageous, and unyielding in defending the country, and is also promoting the great spirit of the nation. The sacrifice of the righteous man Xiao De this time, like the fearless spirit of the 19th Route Army, can be called a perfect match and will last forever.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Funeral: At 2:45 PM yesterday, after the religious ceremony was completed, the funeral procession began with great pomp. It departed from Moore Memorial Church, turned west onto Jing'an Temple Road, passed through Ma Huo Road, Gordon Road, Seymour Road, Xiaoshadu Road, and Hartung Road, to Daxi Road and Hongqiao Road, and arrived at the airport. At the time of departure, the first to depart were the patrol cars and police officers of the Public Concession Police, followed by the cars carrying wreaths, in an orderly manner, a total of forty cars. After that was the coffin, followed by Mrs. Xiao, Xiao's younger brother Edward, and Mrs. Li Jinglun in one car, and then the pallbearers, four people in a row, the first two rows being Tang Hai'an, Yu Hongjun, Shen Dexie, Wang Zhiyuan, Lin Wojiang, Zheng Lai, Guo Dehua, etc., the rest being members of the Commemoration Committee, and then representatives of various groups. The pallbearers mostly changed to cars and went to Hongqiao Airport at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, while the rest dispersed. At the time of the funeral procession, the streets were lined with spectators, numbering over 100,000. Yesterday's funeral was originally planned to be attended by Chinese troops and the Municipal Council's cavalry, but due to various reasons, it was temporarily canceled.</p>
<p>Xiao's Mother Faints: Mrs. Xiao has been in China for</p>
<p>For days, she has been very depressed, resulting in a slight illness. Yesterday, because the righteous man was being cremated, Mrs. Xiao tried her best to support herself and participated in person. However, when the hearse passed the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, Mrs. Xiao suddenly lost consciousness. Xiao's younger brother and relatives and friends helped her into the Cangzhou Hotel, massaged her slightly, and gave her a small amount of medicine. Mrs. Xiao then regained consciousness. At that time, Mr. Aitemen and the righteous man's relatives and friends strongly advised Mrs. Xiao to stay at the Cangzhou Hotel to rest and not to attend the funeral in person. However, Mrs. Xiao loved her son deeply and insisted on participating despite her illness. However, for this reason, the hearse was delayed for ten minutes.</p>
<p>Forming Up at the Airport: When all the funeral procession personnel arrived at Xiaoshadu Road, the righteous man's younger brother, Mr. Aitemen, thanked the various groups and asked them not to send them off any further to avoid fatigue. However, after a portion of the representatives withdrew, the rest hired cars and set off westward. As a result, the entire funeral procession of cars stretched for two or three miles, totaling more than a thousand cars. At 5:20 PM, they arrived at the Lihongyuan side of the east end of Hongqiao Airport. At that time, forty soldiers of the special service company of the third regiment of the 88th Division of our country, armed with guns, lined up to welcome them. All the funeral procession personnel got out of the cars and reorganized their teams. At the front were the troops, followed by the military band, then the Boy Scout team, and then the coffin carried by Chinese and American pilots and the funeral procession personnel. At 5:35 PM, the team slowly began to move towards the cemetery to the sound of mournful music. At exactly 5:30 PM, they arrived at the cemetery at the airport.</p>
<p>Lowering into the Grave: After arriving at the cemetery, our troops and Boy Scout team stood on the right side. When eight Chinese and American pilots carried the coffin inside, the troops raised their guns to salute, and the representatives of the people also removed their hats to salute. The coffin was placed on the rack in the tomb. The righteous man's mother, brother, and relatives stood in front of the tomb. Then, Mr. Fiche gave the final prayer, which lasted for a quarter of an hour. After the ceremony, the righteous man's mother and brother stood silently for a moment at the request of Chinese and foreign film companies to take photographs, which lasted for another quarter of an hour before it was completed. Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, then presented flowers on behalf of the National Government and Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, presented flowers on behalf of the Municipal Government, and each bowed three times to the tomb. Mayor Wu also paid his respects to Mrs. Xiao. Finally, the soldiers fired three volleys, and the coffin was lowered into the grave. At 6:10 PM, the ceremony was completed. Director Tang then asked Mrs. Xiao and Mr. Edward to leave first. At that time, Mrs. Xiao was tearful and reluctant to leave. After a long time, she covered her face and returned by the original car.</p>
<p>Aircraft Show Respect: At yesterday's funeral, it was originally planned that two Chinese and two American aircraft would circle the tomb in the sky to show their respect. However, due to the low air pressure, only American pilot Namoki flew a private plane in a circle, with a black belt on the edge of the aircraft wheel to show respect.</p>
<p>Building a Memorial Tower: The Commemoration Committee of the Righteous Man decided to build a memorial tower in front of the Righteous Man's tomb as a permanent memorial. The Ministry has already contracted the project to the Universal Funeral Home, and construction will begin within days. The Righteous Man's tomb is conveniently located at the entrance of the airport, which is a necessary path for pedestrians. When the memorial tower is completed in the future, the merits of the Righteous Man will last forever.</p>
<p>National Government Provides Financial Assistance: The National Society said that, according to the Commemoration Committee of the Righteous Man Xiao De, the central authorities have decided to provide Mrs. Xiao with 100,000 yuan in national currency as funeral expenses to support her old age. It is said that the funds have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be allocated accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Sun Ke's Talk on the Current Situation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Sun Zhesheng, a member of the Central Committee, has recently been rumored to be entering Beijing frequently. His attitude towards the current situation is of particular interest to the general public. Yesterday, a reporter visited Sun's residence and was given permission to publish his talk, which is recorded below. (Reporter asked) Recently, there have been rumors that you will enter Beijing, some saying that you will take the position of President of the Legislative Yuan, some saying that you will resume your position as Minister of Railways, and some saying that you will take the position of Envoy to the United States. What is the truth?</p>
<p>Can you tell me? (Answer) These are all rumors from the outside world. I telegraphed the Central Committee on January 30 to resign from the position of President of the Legislative Yuan. Last month, I received a letter from President Wang urging me to reconsider. I replied by telegram again, earnestly requesting to resign and asking him to submit the matter to the Central Committee for the selection of other capable people to avoid any mistakes. I know very well that I am not familiar with legal matters. I am only aware of my own limitations. I am afraid of repeating past mistakes. There is no other reason. As the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, the only way to overcome it is to work together with one heart and one mind. If I have any insights or abilities, I will naturally contribute them at any time for consideration. It does not depend on whether I take up a position in a court or department. The rumors about the Minister of Railways and the Envoy to the United States are even more unclear as to where they came from. I have no knowledge of them, but the outside world speaks of them with certainty, perhaps fabricated by well-meaning people, which is also difficult to predict. (Reporter asked) What are your recent views on the current situation? Can you publish them? (Answer) In this autumn when the country is suffering from both internal and external troubles, I have always believed that only thorough resistance to Japan is the only way out for the party and the country. However, in order to thoroughly resist Japan, the whole country and the whole party must be united. In order to unite the whole party and the whole country, there must be other political measures. The so-called political measures are how to promote the completion of constitutional government and training in the shortest possible time and establish a true democratic politics. I have recently discussed with comrades in Shanghai many times and drafted a draft program for national salvation through resistance against Japan. The main point is to take national salvation through resistance against Japan as the goal and to promote constitutional government as the method, so that the party can lead the people and the people can trust the government. This program was telegraphed to Mr. Wang, Mr. Chiang, and Mr. Hu in Hong Kong yesterday, requesting that the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee be convened on a scheduled basis for detailed discussion, decision-making, and implementation. If this program is fortunately approved by the comrades in the party and the people and is implemented, I firmly believe that China will see the light of day again. Mr. Sun then presented a copy of his draft program for national salvation, which reads as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e7">Current Program for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>

<h3 id="e8">Fang Shentao Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Fang Shentao, acting chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, went to the central government some time ago to negotiate important matters. He remained in the capital for a long time. Now, because Minnan [Southern Fujian] is in alarm, he took a ship from Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday and arrived yesterday. Accompanying him were the newly appointed Fujian Civil Affairs Commissioner Liu Tong, Finance Commissioner He Gongzhun, etc. According to what he said to people, Chairman Yang has repeatedly telegraphed his resignation, but the central government has not yet approved it. However, Yang's determination to leave is very firm and he has no intention of returning to Fujian to take charge. I have received the heavy trust of the central government and have no choice but to temporarily take his place in order to avoid a standstill in government affairs. As for the fact that the Communist bandits attacked Zhangzhou and Longyan in full force, Zhang's army was weak and outnumbered, resulting in defeat.</p>
<p>While I was in Nanjing, I already telegraphed orders to the various provincial defense armies to join forces in suppressing them. At the same time, the Guangdong armies, except , have all advanced rapidly. It should not be difficult to suppress the southern bandits in a few days. I will return to the province as soon as I find a convenient ship. I will definitely not stay in Shanghai, he said.</p>

<p>A telegram from various aviation units jointly urging Huang Bingheng to stay reads: To Director Huang of Shanghai,</p>
<p>You, sir, are a pioneer of the revolution and a leader of the air force. Your achievements are manifest to the Party and the nation, and your virtue is appreciated by your colleagues. All those under your command deeply admire you. Recently, in view of the increasing importance of aviation and the many obstacles to its development, you have decided to avoid your position and take responsibility yourself, in order to increase the government's attention to aviation. We deeply admire your noble sincerity. We have followed you for a long time, through thick and thin, and we have the will to share the burden, but we have no way to keep you. Now, the government relies on you heavily and has reassured you again and again. There is complete trust from top to bottom. We are even more convinced that the difficult responsibility still relies on you, sir. We earnestly request that you cancel your resignation and return to Nanjing immediately to lead the way forward. We cannot help but hope and pray.

<p>To Discuss Methods for Promoting the National Crisis Savings Fund</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee Established to Draft Organizational Outline</p>
<p>Preparatory Office Set Up in the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>Various groups, such as the General Federation of Merchants of All Roads and the Citizens' Federation, invited representatives from all circles to discuss methods for promoting the National Crisis Savings Fund at the Atlantic Western Restaurant yesterday. More than 180 people attended, including Lin Kanghou and Shen Tianxin. Wang Hanliang, chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting.

<h3 id="e11">Boy Scouts <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Council Telegraphed Congratulations on the Establishment of the General Association</p>
<p>The Central Committee's Sixteenth Standing Committee Passed the Organization of the China Boy Scout General Association</p>
<p>The China Boy Scout General Association has a fixed date for its establishment. In recent days, congratulations have been pouring in from all sides. According to reports, the national headquarters of the China Boy Scouts has always had the position of Commander of the China Boy Scouts, which is directly under the Central Party Headquarters. Although the Command has had some achievements in the past, it has ultimately failed to fully utilize its strength and develop in a long-term manner due to organizational talent and various relationships, resulting in the proposal to reorganize the National Boy Scout General Association. Now that the president and vice-president of the Association have been appointed, it is of great significance to the future development of the national Boy Scout cause. The Shanghai Municipal Council also sent a special telegram of congratulations yesterday. The text is recorded below: To Chiang Kai-shek, Dai Jitao, and He Jingzhi, members of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing,</p>
<p>We are pleased to read the news that the Sixteenth Standing Committee has passed the organizational plan for the China Boy Scout General Association and has nominated you, gentlemen, to serve as president and vice-president.</p>
<p>Although our country's Boy Scouts have only been promoted and led by our Party for a short time, their achievements are considerable. However, due to the lack of a central organization, the Boy Scout cause has advanced and retreated with the political tides. Regardless of organization or training, it has not yet reached the point of advancement, and talent and economy have not been fully realized. Therefore, the Boy Scout cause, which is extremely important to society and related to children's education, has been slow to develop, which is regrettable. Now, the Boy Scout cause is recognized more deeply by the Party, the nation, and society, and it is increasingly valued by all parties. The Central Committee is particularly important, and in the midst of national crisis, it has resolutely organized the General Association, which shows that it is determined to promote from above.</p>
<p>The future of our Boy Scout cause is no less than the dawn, and we are honored that you, gentlemen, have taken on the difficult task. The future progress of the cause is assured. Our association deeply celebrates that there is leadership, and we send a telegram of congratulations, and pray that you will quickly follow the organizational procedures of the General Association and gradually promote it, so that the General Association, which the nation has been longing for, will be established soon. It is fortunate for the Party, the nation, and the children of the nation. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the China Boy Scouts bows.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Yang Jianping Talks About Postal Savings <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Jianping, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, spoke to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday, saying that the outside world has recently criticized the Postal Savings Bureau in connection with the issue of postage increases. He said, "I was ordered to take over as Director of the Savings Bureau on January 28 this year. That night, the Japanese troops attacked Zhabei. The market was shaken and business almost completely stopped. In addition, the bureau's affairs were complicated, and I could not start to reorganize them for a while, which I regret. The Postal Savings Bureau and the Postal Bureau were separated at the beginning, and Mr. Liu Shufan, who has a long history in postal affairs, served as the director. Mr. Liu has detailed reports on all plans and achievements. Since I took over, I have always had the desire to gather the financial resources of the people and seek the welfare of the people. Moreover, postal savings are the blood and sweat of the common people, so I should operate more cautiously and carefully, so as not to fail the heavy responsibility. However, I happened to be in a time of national crisis, and commerce and finance were difficult, so I did not dare to act rashly in business. Therefore, I can only consolidate the foundation by saving expenses first. The other day, I had already reduced the number of directors, deputy directors, and secretaries by 90, depending on the simplification of affairs or partial mergers, which can save 5,000 yuan per month. Moreover, in order to show impartiality, I also promoted and transferred those who are capable and suitable for the job and single-mindedly for the public from among the original employees. I am especially unwilling to be selfish, so that there is a private system within the public institution. In the future, the business policy will focus on developing the national economy and directly benefiting the people. The Supervisory Committee of the Postal Savings Bureau has been organized by the government, and someone is responsible for checking the previous business accounts and supervising the future bureau affairs. I feel that this reduces my responsibility a lot. People in society truly recognize the importance of the Savings Bureau, and I welcome them to give public advice if they eliminate bias and hold a public view."</p>

<p>The Book Trade Association sent a telegram to the authorities, saying: To President Wang of the Nanjing Luoyang Executive Yuan and Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education,</p>
<p>The postage for books has increased two or three times, which goes against Sun Yat-sen's order to reduce book fees in the early years of the Republic of China, and clearly hinders the development of education and culture in the interior. We have telegraphed to you, but the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications replied that the postage increase was stipulated by the Executive Yuan. You are followers of Sun Yat-sen and leaders of culture, and it seems that you should not be deceived by the Ministry of Communications. The Postal Department is threatening us with the regulations of the Executive Yuan. We urge you to thoroughly investigate and withdraw the order, so as to leave a glimmer of hope for education and culture in the interior. We are anxiously awaiting your orders. Respectfully, the Shanghai Book Trade Association.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Second Declaration of Workers Forced to Leave the Newspaper Office of Shishi Xinbao <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>To all the fellow workers in Shanghai, to all the compatriots from all walks of life,</p>
<p>Eighty years of history tell us that the more severely imperialism invades our country, the closer the relationship between our country's capitalists and imperialism, and the more cruel the means of exploitation of workers. The lives and conditions of workers, peasants, and laborers are even more painful. This time, the capitalists of Shishi Xinbao, in a planned attempt to destroy our newspaper industry's union organization and abolish our conditions, and at the same time evict us from the newspaper office for no reason, is precisely a manifestation of the fact that Japanese imperialism occupies Shanghai and the capitalists of the newspaper take the opportunity to [throw stones down the well] to oppress us. Originally, the bourgeoisie in China today has no determination to resist imperialism at all, but only relies on the despicable means of exploiting the sweat and blood of workers to eke out a living.</p>
<p>When the brothers of the 19th Route Army automatically resisted the Japanese invasion of Zhabei during the [January 28th] incident, and compatriots across the country united to oppose Japan, we worked harder for the capitalists in this artillery fire and rain of bullets, regardless of our own lives. The capitalists of Shishi Xinbao forgot that we laborers were serving them, and instead of planning to oppose Japan, they planned to attack us workers. First, they forced us to do [extra editions] in addition to our daily regular work. More than 100 of us were only given 13 and a half yuan in wages per day (which had to be distributed among more than 80 workers). At that time, we were in the midst of the anti-Japanese war and under the threat of [suspension of publication and dismissal]. We also heard that the capitalists had hired some workers from the north to practice at a certain Western newspaper to prepare to destroy our organization. Therefore, although we knew that this move was a threat and provocation to us, we had to endure the pain in order to avoid being tricked.</p>
<p>The capitalists saw that the conspiracy to provoke had failed, so they used the second step of openly attacking us. On the 2nd of this month, without the consent of the union, they arbitrarily colluded with a very small number of head workers to order us to print the Dawan Newspaper. We politely declined, saying that we could not accept without the union's order. However, the capitalists unreasonably presented us with the following four conditions the next day: (1) Withdraw from the union (destroy the union organization); (2) Abolish the labor-capital conditions (deprive us of all our earned benefits); (3) Do not interfere in the administration of the newspaper office (allow the capitalists to oppress us at will and not allow us to oppose); (4) Dismiss worker Zhang Baokang and others. They sternly forced us to admit these conditions. When we had not yet accepted or refused to express our position, the capitalists' lackey actually beat and insulted our union member Zhang, and drove all the workers out of the workplace and locked it down. They also accused the police of a strike and arrested us. We were forced to leave the newspaper office. The capitalists hired new workers at extremely low prices. On the one hand, the capitalists' lackey used a pistol to threaten and arrest eight of our workers and illegally detained them in the newspaper office. On the other hand, they lured a small number of lackeys to alienate the unity of the workers. They put on the face of the King of Hell and refused to allow us to work. In this way, they used both coercion and enticement to put us to death.</p>
<p>We now know that the capitalists' attitude is so tough precisely because our means are weak and we hope for a peaceful solution. Originally, the oppression of us by the capitalists of Shishi Xinbao this time is precisely the beginning of destroying the entire newspaper industry's union organization and taking away all the benefits that newspaper industry workers have already obtained, and increasing the oppression of newspaper industry workers. At the same time, it is also the beginning of the recent expansion of imperialist forces in China and the joint attack on workers by Chinese and foreign capitalists. Such an attack is by no means a small problem for the entire newspaper industry workers and the national workers, nor can it be won by conservatism or fighting alone. Only by uniting all the workers in the newspaper industry and all the oppressed workers in Shanghai can we counterattack and attack these heartless capitalists in order to break through the current difficulties.</p>
<p>Fellow workers, the situation is tense. The capitalists are intensifying their attack on us. In particular, the capitalists of Shishi Xinbao have concretely expressed this kind of unprovoked oppression. In order to maintain our own lives, we do not want to freeze to death or starve to death. In order to protect the organization and interests of the entire union, we do not want to be defeated by the capitalists one by one. Therefore, we must resolutely struggle and never give up until we achieve our goal. However, in the midst of the joint attack on workers by Chinese and foreign capitalists, it is still thin for us workers of Shishi Xinbao to counterattack alone. We urgently hope that all the workers and laborers in Shanghai, from the same standpoint of the same class and common interests, will unite to help us. Stand up, unite together, and jointly fight for resisting oppression and liberating suffering. We limit the capitalists of Shishi Xinbao to reply to all the workers' demands in the shortest possible time: (1) Immediately restore the situation before April 2; (2) Oppose filling out voluntary forms; (3) Pay wages as usual during the period of leaving the newspaper office; (The Shishi Xinbao newspaper office apologizes to the newspaper industry union. Our slogans: (1) Oppose the Shishi Xinbao capitalists who destroy the labor movement; (2) Down with the labor thieves and lackeys; (3) All the oppressed workers in Shanghai unite; (4) Compatriots across the country unite and sever relations with this Shishi Xinbao, which disregards public affairs, forever. Initiated by all the workers of Shishi Xinbao who were forced to leave the newspaper office.</p>

<p>Jiang Yaowen, a 43-year-old Wuxi native residing at No. 15, Yudeli, Taosha Lane within the city, operated the Renxian Photography Studio at Yimiao. The studio's premises belonged to the County Education Bureau. Recently, due to poor business, the studio suffered significant losses, accumulating three to four months of rent arrears. The landlord pressed for payment, forcing Jiang to seal and nail up the studio door. Jiang also owed several thousand in other debts, and the pressure from both sides caused him great distress, leading him to contemplate suicide. On the afternoon of the 22nd, he checked into Room 106 of the Yue Dong Second Inn at No. 85, Fuxing Lane, Yong'an Street, outside the Xinbei Gate. At 7:00 PM, he moved to Room 206 and ingested raw opium to end his life. The next morning at 10:00 AM, a tea server discovered him. Upon entering the room, they found Jiang's face pale and unable to speak. The incident was reported to the local Mailan police, who rushed Jiang to Renji Hospital. Despite the doctors' efforts, the opium poisoning had spread too deeply, and he died about twenty minutes after admission. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the coroner's office for examination. A note left by the deceased revealed his address. His wife, Jiang Yang, and her younger brother, Yang Changnian, were notified and arrived. The wife requested exemption from autopsy, which the police chief granted. Yesterday afternoon, the family prepared a coffin and collected the body for burial.</p>

<p>Draft of Regulations for Popularly Elected Legislative and Supervisory Committee Members Completed</p>
<p>Method for Convening the National Assembly Undecided</p>
<p>Difficult to Say Whether They Can Be Held Simultaneously</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the regulations for the popularly elected Legislative and Supervisory Committee members, Shao Yuanchong stated that although it is planned to hold them before August this year, the National Assembly was also decided upon by the National Crisis Conference to be convened before October 10th this year. It is difficult to say whether these two important elections can be held simultaneously this year. The loss of the Northeast and the Communist trouble in Jiangxi and Fujian have a significant impact on the election. Therefore, although the draft of the regulations for the popularly elected Legislative and Supervisory Committee members has been completed, the principles are subject to discussion at the assembly. The draft of the method for convening the National Assembly has not yet been completed. The number of Legislative and Supervisory Committee members is not large, and the distribution has not been determined. The number of representatives to the National Assembly is larger, so it is not a problem. Some advocate that the popularly elected committee members be produced by the National Assembly, but this has not yet been discussed. The order of elections, the selection of candidates, and the determination of industry and region will all be submitted to the next Central Political Council to determine their principles.

<p>Austria Simultaneously Holds Provincial Council Re-elections</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd – Tonight in Berlin, over a hundred public gatherings will conclude the Prussian parliamentary election campaign. In total, during this twelve-day campaign period,</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>there were 1,345 public gatherings held. The three open-air rallies separately convened by the National Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Socialist Party are not included in this number, which shows how intense the competition is. The Socialist Party's open-air rally held this morning was actually embellished by a bloodless battle in the sky and set a record for an unprecedented event in election history. After the rally began, the National Socialist Party's propaganda plane came to circle at low altitude, using the rumbling</p>
<p>of the engine to obstruct the speakers' voices. Unexpectedly, after the plane had only flown two laps, a Socialist Party propaganda plane returned. Seeing this, it urgently steered the plane forward, repeatedly feigning collisions. The National Socialist Party's plane, indeed not tolerating the intimidation, eventually left. The main speaker at this rally was the Prussian Premier Braun, a strong opponent of the National Socialist Party, hence this unprecedented bizarre scene. Tonight, Braun will also speak on the radio broadcast, making a final stand. As for this election campaign, in Berlin and various provinces, up to tonight, there have been no major disturbances. The number of people arrested by the police for engaging in minor conflicts is also not very high. The most significant incident was that a group of National Socialist Party members in Cologne attacked a Socialist Party leader and a police chief, leading to a brawl. The disturbance only subsided after the police arrived and made arrests. Both leaders went to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd – Today is the day before the re-elections for the Prussian, Bavarian, and Württemberg state parliaments. The election campaigns of various parties have reached their peak. According to news from various locations, no major incidents have yet occurred, with only minor conflicts in Munich and a few other places, resulting in 30 injuries. According to recent indications, after this Prussian parliamentary re-election, it is feared that none of the parties will be able to win a majority of seats. Perhaps it will be like the federal parliament, with a dictatorial system established and the entire house controlled by a joint committee. National Socialist Party leader Hitler has asked for the support of women, promising that the party will improve family life in the future, making married life happier than it is today, and making the status of mothers more respected. However, the opposition parties ridiculed this by pointing out that the party has not even one female candidate for parliament, so how can it talk about expanding women's rights? In addition, religious issues have also been used as material for election speeches.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 24th – Today, five-sixths of Germany is voting to re-elect the parliaments of Prussia, Bavaria, and Württemberg. Although German voters have voted three times in the past six weeks, the enthusiasm has not diminished at all.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 24th – Today, German President Hindenburg also personally went to the election office near the presidential palace to vote, accompanied by his son. However, his son, being a soldier, had no right to vote and did not vote. When the German president entered and exited the election office, countless people gathered in the nearby streets, cheering and congratulating him, as this was the first time he had appeared among the people since being elected. Premier Brüning voted nearby in the village of Ashaburg in southern Germany and immediately drove back to Geneva. Ashaburg has the ancient castle of the Solms-Braunfels dynasty, and although it is surrounded by Bavarian territory, the village is still part of the Prussian state, hence Brüning went there to vote.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 24th – Because the parties have nominated so many candidates this time, the final results of the parliamentary elections will not be announced until 3 AM tomorrow morning. In this election in Prussia, there are as many as 19 parties competing.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 23rd – Tomorrow is election day. The atmosphere in the streets of Berlin today is very different than usual. Demonstrations by various parties and deafening music are common. Clashes between the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party are commonplace in the city and cause no surprise. What is more striking is that the windows of the entire city are hung with flags, a dazzling array of colors. The workers' areas of Wedding and Rukin are covered in red flags, with a sickle and hammer representing labor and agriculture painted on them. The Steglitz area, where the National Socialist Party is concentrated, is hung with swastika flags. Other areas have the red flag of the Social Democratic Party, with a red, gold, and black symbol in the upper corner. They are everywhere. There are also many residences where the residents on the upper and lower floors belong to different parties, so the flags hanging on the windows of each floor are different from each other, and arguments often occur because of this. It is said that political parties are buying people to hang flags, with each window with a flag being given one mark per day, which is why there are so many flags.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd – Both Germany and Austria are currently busy with elections. According to news from Vienna, although the Austrian elections tomorrow are only for the provincial councils, the results are worth noting, as the strength of the various parties after the 1930 parliamentary elections can be determined from this. The Vienna election results are the focus of particular attention. Since the founding of the republic, Vienna has been the base of the Socialist Party. Tomorrow, Germany will hold elections in four states, with the most noteworthy being the state of Prussia. National Socialist Party leader Hitler is doing his best to win a majority of seats in Prussia. According to news from Berlin, Hitler will indeed win more seats this time, but he may not be able to win a majority.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 23rd – Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of the great poet Shakespeare, has always had a Shakespearean theatre to commemorate him. It was destroyed by fire several years ago. Later, through public donations, the theatre was rebuilt. The design was publicly competed for, and the design submitted by Ms. Scott was selected. The equipment is extremely complete and is the best of all theatres in England. The opening ceremony was held today. The British Prince flew from London to the theatre. In the afternoon, he opened the doors of the newly built Shakespeare Memorial Theatre with a golden key. At that time, the church bells rang, and flags were hung everywhere to celebrate. Local men and women paraded through the streets wearing costumes from the era of Queen Elizabeth. They danced around the Memorial Theatre, and the City Council also held a tea party to entertain visitors. The famous Shakespearean actor Sir Benson gave a speech at the event. Cabinet member Baldwin and the US Ambassador to the UK also gave speeches. The funds for rebuilding this theatre were donated by lovers of Shakespeare's plays all over the world, especially from the United States. Visitors believe that the new building is flawless in terms of aesthetics and comfort. The theatre has an attached restaurant and a large promenade overlooking the scenery of the River Avon.

She is 88 years old, still healthy and robust. Her grandfather and George Washington were brothers. He returned to Europe 150 years ago and settled in the Netherlands. Her father, Vicomte Washington, was on good terms with Bavarian King Ludwig I, so he moved here, served as Minister of the Court, and was ennobled.

<p>Zhang Zhen's Troops Abandon Defense Areas Repeatedly</p>
<p>Bandits Occupy Zhangzhou Without Firing a Single Shot, Xiamen Shocked and on Full Alert</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After Zhang Zhen's troops abandoned Longyan and retreated to Shizhong, it has been rumored here that Zhangzhou was occupied by Sun Lianzhong's rebel troops and the Red Army's Lin Biao and other units for two or three days. On the 19th, the provincial government's telegram to Zhangzhou suddenly failed. As of 7 PM on the 20th, military and political authorities had not received confirmation from Zhang Zhen regarding Zhangzhou. However, business circles received a telegram from Xiamen reporting that Zhangzhou had fallen on the afternoon of the 19th, and that Zhang's troops had retreated to Jiangdong Bridge and Songyu, 20 li away from Zhangzhou. It also said that the number of people coming to Xiamen from Zhangzhou had surged to 10,000 in one day. Xiamen Commander Lin Guogeng also telegraphed the provincial government on the evening of the 19th, reporting that Zhang Zhen had sent his adjutant Wu Hanping to Xiamen around 6 PM that evening to discuss military affairs and talk in detail about the military deployment in Zhangzhou. Wu left Zhangzhou in the afternoon, so the claim that Zhangzhou fell on the afternoon of the 19th is difficult to confirm. However, according to the latest report, Sun Lianzhong's rebel troops launched an attack on Zhangzhou around 12 AM on the 19th, and Zhang Zhen immediately ordered a retreat to Jiangdong Bridge. Zhang's troops in the Nanjiang area also concentrated on Zhangpu. The headquarters was moved to Zhao'an. It is said that Zhang's troops retreated step by step, claiming it was for strategic reasons. Among them, Ruan's regiment moved its defense location three times in one day, suffering the greatest losses. Sun Lianzhong's rebel troops number over 10,000, flying the banner of the Founding Revolutionary Army, and are not Red Bandits. The reasons are rumored to be varied. Some say that the Red areas of Jiangxi are thousands of miles of desolate land with a shortage of salt, so Sun's troops wanted to enter Zhangzhou for food, taking advantage of the situation. Others say that the bandits demanded a certain amount of donations from Zhang's troops. The bandits wanted 800,000, but Zhang Zhen only agreed to 200,000, so the bandits attacked out of anger. Still others say that the bandits' purpose was to loot Zhangzhou and Quanzhou and then move towards Shantou. After receiving the report, the provincial government telegraphed the national government and the Military Affairs Commission to report the situation and telegraphed Guangdong, urging it to send a large force to assist in the suppression. At the same time, the Security Office sent Cheng Shichun and Wang Ping and others to Shanghai on the Yongyu Wheel yesterday (20th) to welcome Fang Shengtao back to Fujian to take charge. Starting on the 19th, Xiamen was ordered by Commander Lin to cut off sea traffic and ordered the guard unit and a part of the land force sent from the province to Xiamen to be on full alert. The Chuyu warship stationed in Xiamen was anchored in Songyu to prevent accidents. The Majiang Command also sent Haichou to Xiamen to increase defense. The Navy Department also considered the defense of Xiamen important and decided to send Chen Jiliang to Xiamen to deploy forces. It is also heard that the national government, at the request of overseas compatriots from Fujian, will send Zhu Shaoliang to aid Fujian. At the same time, Chen Jitang will be urged to take up the post of deputy commander of bandit suppression in the border area and lead his troops to Fujian to suppress bandits to secure the region.

<p>Liu Yinghui Passes Off Japanese Cloth as Chinese Cloth</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Liu Yinghui, the manager of Datong Foreign Cloth Shop on Shanghang Street, is 36 years old and lives at No. 6 Wu Cuo Alley, Shanghang Street. When anti-Japanese sentiment was tense, he served as a standing committee member of the Fuzhou Merchants Anti-Japanese Association and a design committee member of various Anti-Japanese Associations. Since the Anti-Japanese Association was dissolved, Liu has been privately selling Japanese cloth, falsely selling it as Chinese cloth. For the past month, he has received warning letters, but he has ignored them. At 11 PM on the 17th of this month, Liu had already gone to bed when suddenly four youths in Western attire knocked on the door forcefully. After his family opened the door, they entered the hall and said they were visiting Liu. His wife told them he was asleep. The four men said they had important matters to discuss and barged into the room, dragging Liu from the bed to the hall. Seeing the bad situation, Liu immediately shouted that things could be discussed, why did they have to be like this? Before he finished speaking, one of the men drew a pistol and shot Liu in the back of the head twice. Liu immediately fell to the ground and died. The four men then went out together and fled towards the end of the alley. At that time, Liu's family only consisted of his mother, wife, concubine, and young daughter. Seeing the unexpected, they were at a loss. Around 12 AM, Liu's concubine ran to the Shanghang Street police station to report the incident. The station immediately sent a patrol officer to lead the police to investigate. When they arrived at the entrance of Wu Cuo Alley, they saw a car parked there. They asked the driver, who said it belonged to Tian Tanghua Transport Company and had recently carried four guests here. After the guests got out of the car, they asked him to wait a while and took off a coat, leaving it in the car. Unexpectedly, they never returned. The patrol officer immediately escorted the driver Chen Ce, along with the car and coat, back to the station and then went to Liu's house to investigate, but found no other clues. On the morning of the 18th, a notice from the Youth National Salvation Corps suddenly appeared in the city, saying that the traitorous merchant Liu Yinghui, daring to violate public opinion and privately set up an organization to specialize in trafficking in large quantities of inferior goods during the crisis of a strong enemy's misconduct and the urgency of the national crisis, had repeatedly ignored warnings. The corps believes that it is necessary to impose severe sanctions. Now, in accordance with Article 9 of the Corps Law, he is sentenced to death as a warning to those who do not know how to love the country. Now the military and police detectives are searching for the murderers in all directions, but it is unknown whether they will be able to apprehend them. (April 19)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Hu Hanmin Discusses the Issue of Constitutional Government <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Implementation of Constitutional Government Should Emphasize Genuineness Over Speed</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Recently, the call for the implementation of constitutional government has been very loud, and various parties have sent letters and telegrams to seek his opinion. Hu Hanmin has issued the following statement: [Recently, in various places such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, there is a group of people who advocate ending party rule and implementing constitutional government, believing that the current state of affairs is all the fault of party rule, and that only by implementing constitutional government immediately can the nation's strength be concentrated to cope with this serious national crisis. Whether this argument is logically sound is beside the point. However, in recent days, various parties have sent letters and telegrams to solicit my opinion on this issue, so I cannot remain silent. I believe that, according to the Party's principles, the realization of constitutional government is the sole goal of our Party's revolution for decades. Therefore, the Chinese Nationalist Party does not oppose constitutional government and is the only group that promotes and facilitates constitutional government. I have explained this in detail in the explanatory memorandum of the Outline of Political Tutelage, which I issued when I returned from Europe in 1928, based on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Although things have not gone as planned in recent years, the Party's will and my personal views have never changed due to various obstacles. Outsiders do not understand and often believe that the Party's use of party rule for political tutelage is the same as party dictatorship, which is baseless. From the perspective of political science, what history has shown us is that the purpose of a national government must involve the people. Therefore, the success of a country and a government is related to the welfare of all the people. That is why we do not tolerate any tyranny and do our best to oppose the monarchical politics of the Qing Dynasty and the dictatorial politics of the warlords. The only reason is that such politics must exclude the majority and take the interests of individuals or a few people as the interests of the country. Since everyone has the same desires, at least the minimum satisfaction must be given to these desires. The right to participate in politics is one of the means of achieving this minimum degree of satisfaction. Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the people's rights, the politics of the people, by the people, and for the people. Therefore, I firmly believe that the implementation of constitutional government is not only the inevitable destination of modern politics but also the natural demand of the people. However, what we should pay serious attention to is that in the implementation of constitutional government, we should emphasize its genuineness rather than its speed. People often think that once a country has a constitution written on paper, the great task of constitutional government is accomplished. If this is the case, then all the warlords and bureaucrats of the past and even recently have already done it, so why should we argue about it today? I believe that to implement true constitutional government, we must take the Three Principles of the People, that is, the principles of the people, by the people, and for the people, as the content of the constitution, and we must take local self-government as the foundation of constitutional government. At the same time, we should enrich all single-item laws and regulations to establish the scale of the rule of law. Article 14 of the Outline of National Reconstruction states that after the establishment of a local self-government government in each county, it may elect one national representative to organize a representative assembly to participate in central political affairs. Article 16 states that when all the counties in a province have achieved complete self-government, the constitutional government period begins. Article 22 states that the draft constitution should be based on the achievements of the Outline of National Reconstruction and the periods of political tutelage and constitutional government, and be deliberated by the Legislative Yuan and disseminated to the people at any time for adoption and implementation. All of the above is sufficient to be the basis of my consistent views. In the past three years, I have formulated legislative guidelines and devoted myself to legislative work, and I have always followed this. Some may suspect that I am blinded by party views and cling to what the Outline of National Reconstruction says. In fact, anyone who has not forgotten the history of the Republic of China should know that what Mr. Sun Yat-sen said in the Outline of National Reconstruction is a necessary path to achieving true constitutional government. The declaration of the First National Congress has made a thorough explanation based on past facts, saying, "Since the first year of the Republic of China, there have been constitutions, but the remnants of autocracy, warlords, and bureaucrats have usurped power and committed all kinds of evils. The constitution is no different from waste paper, what can it do to protect the people's rights? Recently, Cao Kun bribed illegally and occupied the position in Beijing, and also used the so-called constitution as a tool for decoration, but what he did was as different from the constitution as a horse's neck is from an ox's. Therefore, we know that the prerequisite for promoting the constitution is whether the people can support the constitution. If the people are not organized, even if there is a constitution, the people themselves cannot use it. Even without the destruction of the warlords, it would still be a formality." Therefore,</p>
<p>Constitutionalists only know how to demand a constitution, without considering how to protect the constitution or how to use the constitution. It can be seen that they have no organization, no system, and no courage to truly implement the constitution. What they said can still be used to evaluate today's facts. As for how we will use the paths mentioned in the Outline of National Reconstruction in the future to move towards true constitutional government, I will discuss it separately. Based on the above, I will repeat: We not only do not oppose constitutional government, but we will do our best to realize constitutional government. However, we do not emphasize the speed of the implementation of constitutional government, but its genuineness. I hope that those who care about the issue of constitutional government will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Kobe Shimbun, according to a trade correspondent from Karachi, reported to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry that representatives from Soviet Russia, Balochistan, Afghanistan, and Japanese capitalists are discussing the construction of a railway from Russia through Afghanistan to the Indian border, and using this railway as a center, extending it northward to connect with the Turkish Siberian Railway, and extending it southward to reach the port of Penderbai in the Gulf of Balochistan. The capital for this railway construction will be provided by Japan in exchange for Russia's transfer of its interests in Manchuria to Japan.</p>

<p>Statement by People's Commissar Litvinov</p>
<p>600,000 Troops Only Used to Defend Against Aggression</p>
<p>Kobe Shimbun reported that the Russian representative to the Disarmament Conference and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov said to reporters in Geneva a few days ago that Russia had to be on guard on its border because Japan had sent a large army of 70,000 to Manchuria. However, the Moscow government still maintains friendly feelings towards Japan. However, due to the untrustworthiness of its Far Eastern allies, Russia has to be concerned. Russia has no so-called foreign policy. Today, we are not influenced by external emotions in our peaceful relations with the world, but only seek to develop our own destiny. The 600,000 troops that Russia currently has will be used to defend against external invaders. For the sake of self-defense, we believe that 600,000 troops are indispensable. As for economic issues, Russia is self-sufficient and does not need to seek external help. What is most worrying is that Russia will inevitably be drawn into the vortex in the Far East in the future. However, Russia hopes that its allies will maintain peace, and is willing to conclude the non-aggression treaty that was previously proposed.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Jiangsu Provincial Normal School to Become Independent <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>When Jiangsu Provincial Middle School was reorganized in the 16th year [of the Republic, likely 1927], it adopted a combined middle school and normal school system. Most senior high school normal classes were combined with senior high school general classes in one school. Only Huaiyin Rugao Middle School specialized in normal school education. For several years, normal school students and regular middle school students received the same training, and it was deeply felt that efficiency had not increased. Therefore, the independence of normal schools has become an important issue today. The Department of Education previously held a meeting to discuss the independence of normal schools and planned to start implementing it in the 21st year [of the Republic, likely 1932]. A resolution was passed in principle to gradually expand the normal school classes based on the history, geography, and environmental relationships of each school. Subsequently, when formulating the outline of the provincial education budget for the 21st year, a method was also included to designate several middle schools to specialize in normal school education and not accept senior high school general students, in order to gradually achieve the independence of normal schools. This was approved by the provincial government meeting. Now, five detailed measures have been formulated: (1) Starting from the 21st year, the independence of normal middle schools in the province will be completed in three years. (2) Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Taicang, Huaiyin, Donghai, Rugao Middle Schools, and Suzhou Women's and Xuzhou Women's Middle Schools, etc., eight schools, are designated as schools specializing in normal school education. (3) Starting from the 21st year, the aforementioned eight designated schools will no longer enroll new senior high school general students, and other schools will no longer enroll new senior high school normal school students. (4) The original senior high school general students in the designated schools specializing in normal school education and the original senior high school normal school students in other schools will all continue until graduation. (5) The class levels and funding allocation for each school in the 21st year will be separately compiled and ordered to be followed. The notice has been issued to all junior and senior high schools to comply. After three years, the normal schools in the province can be completely independent.</p>

<p>The Song Bank Bankruptcy Case is Transferred to the Court. According to a Songjiang dispatch, the Songjiang Bank was owed hundreds of thousands [of currency units] in public and private funds by its president, Xie Liangda, who absconded after the bank closed. All depositors hired lawyers and formed a rights group to sue the bank's directors for malfeasance. An investigation was conducted, and the county government convened representatives of public and private depositors, creditors, and leading figures of organizations to form a liquidation committee to resolve the bank's aftermath. The bank's directors, Zhang Xiaomei, Ni Hanchen, Zhou Qianqiao, Qian Xuanqing, Zhang Shengshan, Song Lijiang, etc., also participated. However, the creditor representatives believed that the liquidation should be designated by the court to be legal, so they refused to participate. They sent a telegram to the provincial departments, requesting that the county be ordered to handle the matter according to the law, transfer the Song Bank's account books and records to the court, and thoroughly investigate the directors' corruption. After the provincial government received the joint report from the Departments of Finance, Education, Industry, and Fourth, it believed that the documents and records of the Songjiang Bank should be transferred to the court. It instructed the county government and approved the case. County Magistrate Shen Jie followed the order. The court has received the Song Bank's documents and records and sealed the bank's premises. Regarding whether the directors engaged in corruption, the provincial order instructed the county to transfer the three directors, Zhang, Ni, and Zhou, to the court with a written statement at 10:00 AM on the 23rd. After the prosecutor's office opened a court session for interrogation, Zhang and Ni were each released on bail of 5,000 yuan, and Zhou was released on bail of 2,000 yuan. Regarding public funds, the provincial order designated County Magistrate Shen as the general representative of the public fund creditors, responsible for pursuing legal procedures.</p>
<p>A Robbery Occurs at the New Market. Chen Jimei's residence at No. 7 Lane, Hubin Road, New Market, Hangzhou, was suddenly visited by three robbers at around 9:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd).

Two robbers held guns at the front and back doors to keep watch, and one robber used a handgun to silence the family, driving Chen Jimei and his wife, son, daughter-in-law, and driver into one room. They began to rob, and after forty minutes, they left triumphantly. The losses included more than 130 yuan in banknotes and cash, a gold pocket watch, a gold chain, and five gold rings, with a total value of about 500 yuan.</p>
<p>A Major Theft Occurs at Mapeng.

It is said that the town's losses this time amounted to more than 100,000 yuan, truly an unprecedented disaster.</p>
<p>Various Circles Investigate the Massive Fraud Case. According to a Nantong dispatch, Li Yezhong, the director of the Nantong Public Sports Ground, relying on his sworn brotherhood with Wu Zhonghui, the director of the 25th Route Army's General Inspection Office stationed in Tong, often acted lawlessly in Tong, causing resentment among the locals. Recently, he falsely accused He Zhiyun, a wealthy resident of Pingchao, of being a communist and extorted 10,000 yuan in the name of the Inspection Office, actually receiving 1,000 yuan. When the matter was exposed, Li fled. Various circles have telegraphed Liang Guanying to thoroughly investigate the case.</p>

<p>But Still Able to Sail into Songkou</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reported that the Kamau steamer of a Hong Kong company, which departed from Shanghai on Friday afternoon, loaded with cargo bound for Gukou, struck the Chicken Bone Reef outside the Yangtze Estuary at around 10:00 PM. The bow was damaged by the rocky reef, and seawater poured into the forward hold. However, after inspection, it was determined that it could still sail back to Shanghai. So, it immediately turned back and sailed home, while pumping out the water in the forward hold. It arrived at Songkou at 4:30 AM yesterday morning and ran aground on the Pudong shoal. It immediately reported to the Wusong Customs River Affairs Department, which sent personnel to investigate and hired the Jardine Matheson tugboat to assist.

<p>The Murderer Drafts a Suicide Note</p>
<p>Claiming the Victim Committed Suicide</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM last night, a tourist from Songjiang, Sun Wenqiu, 45 years old, who worked in the general affairs department of the Jin Cheng Bank, was suddenly confronted by his enemy, Song Zigao (who worked in Bansong Garden), on the upper floor of the Great World amusement center at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII. As the saying goes, enemies often meet on a narrow road. Song took out a small knife and, without asking any questions, stabbed Sun in the throat, severing the windpipe and causing a gush of blood. At that time, Song threw a pre-written letter into Sun's long gown pocket and then fled without a trace. The contents of the letter falsely claimed that Sun was in dire financial straits and had reached the point of suicide, attempting to shift the blame onto Sun. One can imagine the cunning and viciousness of his methods. Later, someone summoned Chinese Constable No. 503, hired a car, and sent Sun to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries were severe and life-threatening.</p>

<p>Cleaver cuts the buttocks</p>
<p>The police brought a public prosecution</p>
<p>Lu Laisheng, a native of Jiading residing at No. 1011 Linqing Road, had his wife, Yue, become involved with a person named Chen Guiqing last autumn, secretly having an affair more than once. Yue would often give money to Chen for him to spend lavishly. Lu found out about this, and it was said that they had lost a total of 300 gold [yuan]. At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, he questioned Yue about it. She spoke disrespectfully and even cursed him. Lu became furious and went to the kitchen to get a cleaver, which he swung at Yue's buttocks, cutting deeply into the flesh. She immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely, and cried out for help. Lu took the opportunity to escape, but Hua Detective Pang Duanqing of the Yangshupu Police Station happened to pass by and, together with Chinese Constable No. 2704, arrested Lu and took him to the police station. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yue was taken to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment in a car. The next morning, the police escorted Lu Laisheng to the first special district court's first tribunal.

<p>The Hong Kang Pawnshop on Tokyo Road in Western Shanghai suddenly caught fire at 2:00 AM on February 27 this year. After the fire brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire, most of the buildings and goods had been burned, with losses amounting to more than 50,000 yuan. Subsequently, 160 customers, including Xu Gongxia, accused the pawnshop's manager, Zhang Gengsheng, of arson for fraudulent purposes. They hired lawyer Xi Ya'fu to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. After one interrogation, it was ordered to postpone the case because more witnesses needed to be summoned. The matter was recorded in this newspaper. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the hearing in the second criminal court. The defendant, Zhang Gengsheng, still appeared in court with his lawyers Yuan Yang'an and Zhang Hengshan. Witness Dai Yuanyuan testified that he was the insurance department director at Ning Shao Insurance Company. Hong Kang Pawnshop held fire insurance with this company for 20,000 taels of silver. After the fire, the next day, he entrusted Yizhong Appraisal Firm to investigate the losses and the cause of the fire. He has not yet received Yizhong's report, so he could not say anything in detail. However, on that day, he went to the Putuo Road Police Station to investigate the cause of the fire and whether there was arson. The police station said that no evidence of arson had been found. Ge Jichen, the manager of Yizhong Appraisal Firm, testified that he was entrusted by Ning Shao and Yong'an Insurance Companies and sent staff to investigate at 10:30 AM on February 27. Sanyi Appraisal Firm had arrived earlier and jointly sorted out the remaining items. They asked the police station about any evidence of arson. The police said that they could not find any evidence and would notify them if any evidence was found in the future. He received a letter from the police station on the 11th of this month after seeing in the newspaper that the Hong Kang Pawnshop had been sued by the customers. He submitted the reply letter and the photos taken at the fire scene at that time. He also stated that Hong Kang Pawnshop held fire insurance for 52,000 taels with various insurance companies. After reviewing the pawnshop's ledger, the value of the pawned silk and leather clothing was more than 50,000 yuan, which, together with the two-point interest, totaled 59,945 yuan, consistent with the insurance amount. E. Arnold, the British manager of the Lao Gongmao Insurance Company, testified that Hong Kang Pawnshop had taken out fire insurance with them for 22,000 taels. After the fire, he went to investigate, but the investigation was still ongoing and had not concluded. The cause of the fire could not be determined, but it did not appear to be arson, and it was likely a careless fire. Watson, the British manager of Sanyi Appraisal Firm, testified that he was entrusted by Lao Gongmao and Sincere Insurance Companies and went to inspect on that day. Because most of the goods had been burned, valuation was extremely difficult and could only be determined based on the ledger. No evidence of arson was found. Liang Guohua and Lu Ruizhi, representatives of Sincere and Yong'an Insurance Companies, submitted a statement that Hong Kang Pawnshop had taken out fire insurance for 50,000 taels with each company. After the fire, they did not go to investigate but entrusted the appraisal firm to handle the matter. They had not yet received a report from the appraisal firm, so they had nothing to say. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the statements and ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing. The defendants were dismissed.</p>

<p>Spends Two Hours</p>
<p>Finally Traps the Thief</p>
<p>Shen Xiulan, a girl from Qingjiang, is only thirteen years old, petite and exquisite, and very clever. Her father, Shen Zhengfu, could not farm due to famine and hardship, but possessed martial skills, so he abandoned his sickle and hoe and joined the army. Recently, he had gone to war without regard for his own safety, and his beloved daughter had no one to care for. So, Shen sent Xiulan to be a child bride in the home of a relative in Nanyang Bridge a few days ago. Xiulan had only been in Shanghai for ten days. The day before yesterday, she borrowed two gold coins and a pair of trousers from a relative on Pingji Road and asked Xiulan to retrieve them. She packed them in a small bundle, hired a rickshaw pulled by Wu Xuetai to return home. When the rickshaw arrived at Nanyang Bridge, Xiulan got off to pay the fare. Unexpectedly, Wu took advantage of her youth and snatched the bundle and fled without a trace. Xiulan was very clever. Since her aunt was not as caring as her mother, she was afraid of being beaten, so she did not dare to go home and vowed to find the rickshaw puller. After two hours, she saw the rickshaw puller near the Great World amusement center. Because there were no police officers there, she was afraid of being outnumbered, so she devised a plan. She pretended not to recognize him and hired him to go to the West Gate. Wu had already seen the girl and hesitated, shaking his head to indicate that he would not pull her. The girl said, "Hire your rickshaw, pay you money, why not go?" The rickshaw puller thought that she was not the girl whose belongings had been stolen, so he bargained with her. The girl deliberately lowered the price to 100 cash and took him to the police booth in Nanyang Bridge, where she called the police and had Wu arrested in the second district and sent to the court for investigation.</p>

<p>Baoshan County Teachers: Baoshan County Teachers' Association of Shanghai held a discussion meeting at the Municipal He'an Elementary School on Chengdu Road in Zhabei at 1:00 PM on April 24, convened by Principal Zhu. Principal Zhu Jiaji, Dean of Education Kong Junyi, and more than fifty students including Ling Danru, Xu Youwen, Chen Ruhui, Wang Linfen, Wang Xunfen, and Gu Honghui discussed the continued learning plans for the school's third-year students and the fourth-year practical internship visits.

<p>Merchant Marine School: The Wusong Merchant Marine School of the Ministry of Transportation has been suspended since the outbreak of the Shanghai war. The Ministry of Transportation previously ordered it to temporarily close due to the school's significant losses and to reopen after raising a large amount of funding.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the school authorities and all students argued that Shanghai universities had already rented buildings and started classes, and that the school's nature was important. If it remained closed for a long time, it would inevitably affect the shipping industry and the students' studies. They appealed to the Ministry of Transportation to quickly find a way to restore it. It is now learned that the Ministry of Transportation has ordered the school's principal to review the reopening plan and submit a reply for approval. It is now said that the school authorities have prepared for all matters related to the reopening and have submitted a report to the Ministry of Transportation for instructions. Once the Ministry's order arrives, they will notify the reopening.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Last Week Gold Prices Continue to Strengthen <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Eight Consecutive Weeks of Gains Totaling Eighty-Three Taels</p>
<p>The standard gold price has seen drastic fluctuations over the past four weeks. The surging waves could not be suppressed, with daily rises and falls of over ten taels, a tortuous and confusing situation that left people terrified and without any sense of certainty. This was truly influenced by the divergent trends in overseas silver markets. In England, prices rose, while in America, they remained stable. Starting from the beginning of the week, prices initially rose and then fell, followed by a sudden surge. On Wednesday morning, prices briefly rose to 725.8 taels before a sudden and sharp decline. This was due to frequent news reports about the United States planning to raise exchange rates to the 1926 level or potentially abandoning the gold standard. Prices quickly broke through the 700-tael mark, plunging to a low of 699 taels. Furthermore, the complex international situation led to Shanghai's exchange rates for British pounds remaining stable and American dollars remaining steady, while the exchange rates initially fell and then rose, with minor fluctuations reported. As a result, gold prices entered a state of fluctuation, with speculators and major players pursuing different strategies for buying and selling, engaging in mutual control. However, by the end of the week, a bullish trend reemerged, pushing prices beyond 710 taels. Over the course of the week, there was a total swing of 26.8 taels. Overall, prices rose by 6.9 taels, marking eight consecutive weeks of gains totaling 83.4 taels. Compared to the opening price of 712.5 taels on the first day of the market, there was also an increase of 1.7 taels. The exchange rates for British and American currencies fell by a total of 2.25 and 1.875 points, respectively, leading to a slight increase in the forward premium. The domestic market remained flat, while the American exchange rate tightened. The gold industry experienced various opinions and disputes, but generally, bearish sentiment prevailed. As for the spot standard gold, the Central Bank continued to absorb it, and its price was lower than the June futures. The initial price difference was around 60 taels, later reaching over 80 taels before settling around 70 taels. The exchange rate hedge spread was approximately 40 taels. Below is a summary of the weekly developments:</p>
<p>Daily Storms Occurred Throughout the Week</p>
<p>(Monday) The 18th: The large silver bar continued to rise by 0.3125, the American silver bar by 0.25, and the forward premium initially increased by 0.125. The American dollar rose by 0.25, but in the afternoon, it suddenly decreased by 0.125, and the American dollar fell by 0.25. However, the domestic market showed a strong upward trend, with the forward premium particularly tight due to the rising British and American exchange rates. The June gold market initially opened with a rise of 0.7 taels to 708 taels, driven by the larger increase in the American silver bar. There was a slight rise and fall, and at noon, major players like Ying [surname] and others competed to buy, pushing the price from 7.2 to 14 taels. The market closed at 12.9 taels. The afternoon opened at 14.2 taels, with the Dalian group taking the lead. Later, due to the decrease in the forward premium, prices surged to 20 taels, reaching 20.05 taels before closing back at 19.2 taels, an increase of 11.9 taels compared to the previous Saturday. The total fluctuation for the day was 13.3 taels.</p>
<p>(Tuesday) The large silver bar fell by 0.3125, the silver price decreased by 0.25, and the British and American exchange rates rose again. HSBC's listed price decreased by 0.125. Internally, the British currency was stable, while the American currency was looser. The gold market initially opened with a small decrease of 2.2 taels to 717 taels.</p>
<p>Due to a slight decrease in the American silver bar, the situation was the opposite of the previous day. Later, prices fell from 19 taels to 15 taels. As Ying [surname] and others entered the market, and the exchange market tightened, prices rose rapidly by 7 to 8 taels, reaching 23.2 taels. Suddenly, rumors of a tense situation between Japan and Russia spread, causing a drop of 4 to 5 taels. The market closed at 18.8 taels at noon. The afternoon opened at 18.1 taels, and increased buying drove prices higher. The Indian exchange rate also reported a small increase, reaching 19.4 taels before falling back to 15.5 taels. By the close, the price was 15.7 taels, a drop of 3.5 taels. The total fluctuation for the day was 8.2 taels.</p>
<p>(Wednesday) The large silver bar and silver price each decreased by 0.125. The British gold remained unchanged, while the American gold dropped slightly by 0.125, indicating a fall in exchange rates. The standard gold opened at 19 taels, already an increase of 3.3 taels, before rising to 25.8 taels. Later, news of the United States planning to raise exchange rates circulated, along with reports that the Silver Association would make progress and rumors that the situation between Japan and Russia was escalating. Prices plummeted, breaking through 700 taels and suddenly reaching 699 taels. Due to the Central Bank opening spot transactions, prices returned to 14 taels, closing at 11.8 taels. The afternoon saw prices ranging from 12.5 to 14.5 taels, with major players selling at 10.02 taels before closing at 13.2 taels, a further decrease of 2.5 taels. The total fluctuation was 26.8 taels, with extreme volatility leaving everyone at a loss.</p>
<p>(Thursday) The large silver bar rose by 0.1875, the silver price remained unchanged, and the exchange market was seemingly stable but loosely managed. The gold market initially opened with an increase of 0.3 taels to 13.5 taels, later reaching 18.3 taels before retreating to 12.4 taels. At noon, the price was 19.2 taels, closing at 18.7 taels, with little overall change. Transactions were sluggish at various firms. The afternoon opened at 19.8 taels, and news suddenly emerged that the Netherlands was withdrawing a large amount of deposits from the United States, causing immediate concern. Prices gradually declined, breaking through 10 taels to reach 8.5 taels. With the exchange market also loose and excessive, the Central Bank's cash transactions led to a price of 13 taels, closing at 11.2 taels, a decrease of 2 taels compared to the previous day. The total fluctuation for the day was 11.3 taels.</p>
<p>(Friday) The large silver bar continued to rise by 0.0625, the American silver bar increased by 0.25, and both British and American exchange rates rose by 0.125. The domestic market was also loose. The standard gold price increased by 0.3 taels to 11.5 taels, with the market generally stable. Prices then fell from 12.5 taels to 3 taels, due to major players selling off and the forward premium loosening. The Central Bank again opened spot transactions, and speculator Lu [surname] entered the market, pushing prices back to 8.4 taels, closing at 7.1 taels. The afternoon opened at 6 taels due to news that the UK was increasing import duties, preventing the forward premium from increasing. The price later reached 5 taels, and the Guangdong group entered the market, pushing the price to 9 taels, closing at 7.8 taels, a further decrease of 3.4 taels (four consecutive days of decline totaling 11.4 taels). The total difference for the day was 9.5 taels.</p>
<p>(Saturday) The large silver bar rose again by 0.1875, the American silver bar remained unchanged, and both the forward premium and the American dollar increased by 0.25. However, the domestic market tightened due to continued activity from Bombay and Mobil, causing the gold market to open with a significant increase of 1.5 taels to 709.3 taels. Later, Wu [surname] sold off, and the Dutch government withdrew 45 million in deposits, fearing a hardening of the American exchange rate, leading to an immediate retreat to 2 taels. Subsequently, buyers became aggressive, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. With the exchange market strengthening, prices rose steadily, reaching 14.5 taels at noon, closing at 14.2 taels, an increase of 6.4 taels compared to the previous day, reversing the four-day decline. The total difference for the half-day was 12.5 taels. Below is a table listing the highest and lowest prices for British and American silver markets and standard gold exchange rates:</p>
<p>Category	Highest	Lowest	Change Compared to Last Saturday</p>
<p>Large Silver Bar (Near Term)	17 pence	16 pence 5625	Up 3215</p>

<h3 id="e97">Financial Market Atmosphere Depressed <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Interest Rates Unchanged</p>
<p>Silver Dollars Showed Solely a Decline</p>
<p>Due to the current political situation, all industries have stagnated this year, and financial liquidity is severely hampered. This is especially true every week, and yesterday, the situation was even more desolate. The market was sparsely populated, with no signs of market vigor. As a result, interest rates remained stagnant, with no one vying for higher or lower prices. The closing price was 7 cents 02 li 8 hao 7 and a half, the same as the midday price the previous day. The midday activity was fleeting, and prices saw no changes whatsoever. Silver interest rates also remained the same, without any fluctuations. Very few transactions occurred. Early morning exchange drafts totaled only 155,000, and the midday amount was 75,000, less than half of the previous day's total. Interest rate transactions totaled over 1.3 million across both sessions. Money shops and silver firms received and delivered over 24 million, while foreign firms received and delivered 2.3 to 2.4 million. Transactions in smaller money shops amounted to over 300,000. Jiangnan silver dollars had limited uses, with the price decreasing slightly by 1 li to 6 cents 03 li. The price was the same in both the early morning and midday sessions. Transactions totaled only 2,500 coins in the early morning session. Guangdong silver dollars were priced at 6 cents 03 li and a half in the early morning session, a decrease of 3 li compared to the previous day's early morning session. The midday session rebounded slightly by 7 hao and a half to 6 cents 04 li and 2 hao and a half, resulting in a decline of 2 li and 2 hao and a half compared to the previous morning. Transactions totaled 80,000 coins in the early morning session and 20,000 coins in the midday session. Copper coins decreased by 1,500 cash, totaling 416,000 cash, with over 36,000 strings traded.</p>
<p>Textile and Flower Purchases Weak Everywhere</p>
<h3 id="e98">Last Week Extremely Dull Textile Sales <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>With only 2,779 bales of cotton yarn actually sold last week, there was no progress. Demand from various groups remained slow and sluggish. Sales volume remained similar to the previous period, and selling prices trended downward, with a severe decline. Last year's floods were too severe, and this year's Shanghai war has been intense. With the Jiangzhe area dotted with textile mills, both the Shanghai-Hangzhou railways have been affected by the war, and financial circulation has been disrupted. All businesses have come to a standstill, and the recent sharp decline in silver dollars to the 7-cent mark has led to domestic yarn prices being priced in foreign currency. Shanghai, for example, uses customs taels, which has resulted in yarn prices secretly increasing by 7 to 8 yuan per piece. Textile sales have been further impacted. The Wuxi yarn mill's sales market is quiet, and inventory is accumulating, indicating the weakness of domestic business. The economy has dried up, and purchasing power has greatly diminished. Shanghai factories are accumulating increasingly large stockpiles, estimated to be over 60,000 bales. The Yangtze River area is lifeless, and Japanese yarn has already invaded North China. In South China, over 20 silver shops in Guangzhou have gone bankrupt, silver funds are extremely tight, and the market is in a precarious state. Therefore, overall, the future is quite worrisome. A review of all groups' purchases for the week shows a total of 2,239 bales bought, with 540 bales purchased by fellow merchants. All other groups made smaller, fragmented transactions. Prices for 42-count and 32-count yarns fell by 7 to 8 taels, and 20-count yarn fell by 3 to 4 taels. The Shenxin factory opened occasionally during the week, but there were few other activities. Below is a breakdown of the purchase volume by various groups:</p>
<p>Group</p>
<p>Domestic 211</p>
<p>North 520</p>
<p>Anqing 20</p>
<p>Guangdong 560</p>

<p>Total 2779 bales</p>
<h3 id="e99">Quiet Demand and Low Prices: Depressed Cotton Market Last Week <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Cotton sales were very quiet last week. With the textile market weak and American and Indian cotton prices falling, confidence was weak. The Shenxin factory made some purchases, but having bought a large quantity in recent days, its appetite has been satiated and it has stopped buying. Although Japanese factories have gradually resumed operations, they were shut down for over two months after the Shanghai war broke out. There is now a surplus of foreign cotton purchased previously. Japanese warehouses have 170,000 bales of cotton in stock and are eager to sell them off. However, domestic cotton inventory is still low, and factories are unwilling to buy. Selling prices are weak, and American cotton prices fell by 20 points this week compared to the previous week. Below is a breakdown of the purchase volume by various factories:</p>
<p>Factory	Price (High)	Price (Low)	Volume	Terms</p>
<p>Huoji Flower	31.25	30.75	2,000 bales	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Xingheng Flower	30.50	1,000 bales	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Flower	34.00	100 bales	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Yao Flower	30.90	700 bales	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<h3 id="e100">American Cotton Drought Ends with Rain <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to selling pressure and rain ending the drought in Texas. Later, prices rebounded as fellow merchants bought, with futures falling by 1 to 2 points. Spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures fell by 5 to 6 points, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (Telegram dated 23rd):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the southern market at Hetuo [river] was not very lively. The Shanghai market completely stopped at 3 p.m. Changshu northern glutinous rice and those from the Suzhou group had only four bags, and they were quickly sold. Prices rose by 1 jiao and a half compared to the previous day. Early and late rice were sold as soon as they arrived. The opening price was reduced by 2 jiao. Although there was not much foreign-style top-grade rice, the price was high and firm for better quality and soft for lesser quality. There was no reed-tip rice available on the market.</p>
<p>In the northern market yesterday morning, the weather cleared up. There was a limited supply of Xisu white glutinous rice, and prices gradually increased. Green-tip Sisong thin rice was in short supply, and prices rose by 2 jiao. There was a limited supply of Hetuo foreign-style top-grade rice. The riverbanks and rice mills had a small inventory and asked for several points more. Yuan was sold in equal amounts, and the market was flat. About 5,000 piculs were opened at Hetuo.</p>

<p>Silk Market Increasingly Lifeless Last Week</p>
<p>European and American Silk Sales Increasingly Stagnant</p>
<p>Silk Prices Consistently Plummeting</p>
<p>Jiangzhe Silkworm Season Begins</p>
<p>The Silk Industry Has Fallen into a Desperate Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign firm silk market was increasingly lifeless last week. The economies of countries around the world have been declining, and spring silk sales have been exceptionally slow. Silk inventories have surged, and summer orders show no signs of improvement. Silk merchants can barely sustain themselves. Sales of artificial silk are encroaching, and silk consumption has decreased. Silk sales in the United States, France, and England have plummeted. Silk prices have consistently fallen. Shanghai Chinese silk merchants have found that prices from overseas are increasingly low, resulting in huge losses that cannot be offset. The spring silkworm season has begun in Jiangzhe, and Shanghai warehouses have weak silk inventories. The silk industry has fallen into a desperate situation. European firms, given the state of the European and American silk markets, are unwilling to take risks and make purchases. The future of the silk market looks increasingly bleak. Last week, only French and Indian firms supplemented yellow silk with over a hundred bales of spot goods. Exports totaled only over three hundred bales. Below is a table listing the prices of Chinese silk in European and American markets at the end of last week (New York price per pound in gold dollars, Lyon price per kilogram in French francs):</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the week's being over, there were no telegrams from the producing areas. The Shanghai Sugar Association's market trading remained quiet. Buying interest was particularly weak, and selling pressure surged. The market outlook was poor. Dutch sugar No. 64, raw sugar, and white sugar prices fell to 12 taels 7 jiao and a half. Finely ground white sugar was 12 taels 8 jiao and a half. Transactions were few and far between. Taikoo sugar B was 16 taels 2 jiao, and HM was 13 taels 7 jiao. The market was slightly more stable, but transactions were still quiet. Renji Factory offered dozens of bags of its No. 1 cotton white sugar at 13 taels 1 jiao, which the Upper Jiang group purchased. The market situation was flat and unremarkable. Miscellaneous News: 17,000 bags of flour and 7,000 pieces of paper were shipped to Qingdao.</p>
<p>7,000 bags of sorghum were shipped to Pukou.</p>

<p>Niu Yongjian told people in Peiping: "[For long-term resistance, the central government will make Nanjing the maritime capital and Lanzhou the land capital; Japanese troops are building fortifications in Shanghai, and due to international relations, our side cannot counterattack." This proves that the central government's so-called "long-term resistance" is actually a "long-term non-resistance!" But watch as the government moves to Luoyang, with plans to move again to Lanzhou. If Lanzhou becomes unstable, will it move to Europe? The people groan under the iron hooves of the enemy, while the government can move the capital to escape danger. But Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan once said that the Chinese navy is only good for three minutes of resistance, so how can "maritime capital" be explained? Of the two million soldiers, only the 19th Army and the 5th Army dare to resist, so how can "land capital" be explained? Tsk! The government is at a loss, clinging to life, sitting idly by as the country changes color, all for the sake of "international relations!"</p>

<p>Although the puppet state of Manchuria is said to be established, there are many incongruous things. It really does not resemble a country. This is probably due to the fact that traitors and the Japanese have different dreams. Also, between the traitors and the traitors, the Japanese and the Japanese, opinions are also inconsistent. Therefore, everywhere presents an incomplete likeness. Its system of non-donkey non-horse, it goes without saying. Even puppet officials submitting reports to Puyi, there is no fixed pattern. Some are completely like memorials, some still use the format of Republican official documents. Among them, those who are overly flattering to Japan, even simulate the Japanese format, to win the favor of Japanese advisors. The puppet government has not made any expression on this. Only the puppet provincial office of Jilin issued two instructions regarding the writing of the year in official documents and letters of various institutions. It said that recently, the end of official documents and letters often wrote "Manchuria Year 1," which is very incomplete. If no further orders are given to change, it will be difficult to standardize. Therefore, from the command onwards, all official documents, letters, correspondence, account books, marriage certificates, tax deeds, etc., shall uniformly write "Great Manchuria Datong Year One" to achieve standardization. Do not neglect, etc. Xi Qia first betrayed the Republic of China, and contributed the most. I initially thought that he must not know what "the matter" is. Unexpectedly, he actually knows it. Then he also knows that selling out the country for personal glory, and willingly acting as a puppet, is fundamentally an incomplete affair?</p>

<p>During the January 28th Incident, the Japanese invaders used North Sichuan Road as a base. Japanese soldiers coming and going were all high-spirited, as if this road was already their private property, arbitrarily plundering and rampaging wildly. Anyone with a little bit of spirit couldn't help but feel righteous indignation and wish to contribute their lives to repay the country. My friend Qi Jun talked about the story of a butcher on North Sichuan Road. Although it belongs to the past, it is still touching and admirable, and illuminates the nation. I will record it here to enrich this talk.</p>
<p>A certain butcher ran a pork shop at the north end of North Sichuan Road. He was generous by nature, happy to help those in need, and loved to drink. Every evening, he would drink heavily in his shop. After the incident, he sent his wife and son to the countryside. Because business was slow during the war, he told his two apprentices to return home temporarily. Then he stayed to guard the shop. One day, he happened to be very drunk and saw more than ten Japanese soldiers blocking a Chinese woman on the road, making jokes and teasing her. He was greatly angered. He shouted to the Japanese, "Since a man cannot join the army to kill the enemy, he should also sacrifice himself to repay the country, so as not to waste this magnificent seven-foot body!" After shouting, he held the beef-eared knife that he usually used, jumped to the center of the road, and with a wave of his hand, a Japanese soldier died instantly. At first, the Japanese soldiers did not expect this to happen. When they saw that one of their companions had fallen in a pool of blood, they fought him in groups. Before long, the butcher killed six more people in a row. The remaining people, seeing that they could not defeat him, quickly blew their whistles. Japanese police gathered in large numbers, shooting fiercely. The butcher was hit by several bullets and fell with a smile. Alas, how heroic!</p>

<p>The Fat Queen on a Small Island East of the Fiji Islands in the South Pacific, there is a cluster of small islands called Tonga. Tonga can be considered the smallest kingdom in the world. The queen of the country, called Salote Tupou, can be considered the fattest and biggest queen in the world. She is six feet six inches tall measured barefoot and weighs three hundred pounds. Usually, she wears very little clothing, with more exposed parts. When the country holds some grand ceremony, she must wear a long robe of white rat skin, with a crown on her head, and wear many bejeweled ornaments. She rules three hundred and eighty-five miles of land and twenty-six thousand five hundred and eighty-seven people. Because it belongs to the UK, she was conferred by the British King as a noblewoman of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Lights Out We want to prevent the enemy planes from ravaging us. During the day, issue air raid alerts to warn all parties. At the same time, send fighter planes to attack enemy planes. At night, use very strict control of lights. What is called lights out? It is to install light control in the vicinity of military ports. Except for the necessary lights, all other lights are completely extinguished. At the same time, use searchlights to detect enemy planes. In the mouths of military ports, set up anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. When enemy planes come, use smoke to cover the military ports. At the same time, fearing that enemy planes will drop poison gas bombs, organize protection groups. Cooperate with the army to share the fire prevention and poison prevention and other evacuation rescue work. To know the whereabouts of enemy planes in advance, set up airplane watchmen in various places. If enemy planes are found, report to all parties by telegram, telephone, whistle, etc. The purpose of very strict light control is to hide the target of enemy planes' attacks. Therefore, never leak light, lest it be detected by the enemy. Then the enemy planes cannot use their means. Now our country has not paid attention to various facilities. Judging from the enemy planes attacking Suzhou on March 20th and the bombing of the Hangzhou Qiaodong Airport on February 4th, if we had made some preparations beforehand, the enemy planes would definitely not have been able to show their brutality.</p>

<p>— Master of the Hall of Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Betrayal Leads to Severance of Ties, Misfortune Brings Encounter with a Generous Stranger, Anger Shuts Down Affection, Planning is Most Difficult, Accepting the Grace of a Beauty is Too Much.</p>
<p>If it were just those common, small-time bandit gangs, who truly overestimated themselves and came looking for trouble, they would certainly be slaughtered, leaving a trail of fallen flowers. This would make them understand that An Family Village is extremely formidable and not to be trifled with. However, while military force is indispensable and bandits must be guarded against, one cannot rely solely on bravery and aggression to subdue people with force. To avoid forging deep, irreconcilable hatred with those reckless villains who fear no death, it is necessary to be somewhat flexible and make some effort to turn enemies into friends. It wouldn't hurt to maintain secret communication with them, exchanging information. As long as future peace is maintained, even if a small amount of tribute is given to them annually or seasonally, or if some convenience is provided in concealing their actions from the authorities, there would be nothing unacceptable about it. Fortunately, the strange phenomenon of local gentry harboring bandits, and good citizens colluding with bandits, had been prevalent for a long time. Moreover, the heroes, shouting the slogan "rabbits don't eat grass near their nests," would gladly do this favor, resulting in a fair exchange and peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>The person who exerted effort in mediating this was An Yu-tian's paternal uncle, An Da-kui. In their family's elder generation, An Da-cheng was the eldest, and An Da-kui was the third. There was also a second uncle, who had passed away early, leaving behind only a young son. Since he had also lost his mother, An Da-cheng and his wife took him in, treating their nephew as their own son. He was An Yu-tian's younger brother, An Yu-yuan. This An Da-kui did not succeed in his studies at home and preferred to associate with hooligans and rascals in the village. Surprisingly, he got to know the famous bandit chief, Niu Hei-feng. This Niu Hei-feng grew up not far from the neighboring county. He had been mixing with bandits since he was a teenager. Later, he surrendered twice and even served as a formal military officer twice, gradually rising in rank. On the third occasion, he rebelled again, becoming a bandit. He seized many guns and coerced many people, and thus rose to become the biggest gang leader. An Da-kui wanted to get a piece of the military pie. Presumably, during the time when Niu Hei-feng surrendered and became a military officer, they established a connection and even kowtowed together, becoming sworn brothers. After Niu Hei-feng resumed his bandit career, An Da-kui, although he did not follow him up the mountain, still maintained contact through messengers, exchanging information. Therefore, Niu Hei-feng, mindful of this friendship, never harassed An Family Village. An Da-cheng, through his brother's introduction, had also met Niu Hei-feng and greatly approved of An Da-kui's actions, willing to maintain a considerable friendship with Niu Hei-feng. In recent years, An Da-kui had found another opportunity to go out and work in a military position. Coincidentally, a military unit belonging to that organization was stationed in a small market town more than thirty li away from An Family Village.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Puppet Marriage <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Gou</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that "Pu Yi's eldest sister, Second Princess Yun He, and Zheng Xiao-xu's grandson, Yi Kai, were married in Changchun at 1 PM on the 18th, according to the old Qing dynasty system. At 11 AM that day, the groom, wearing Qing dynasty court attire, followed his uncle, Zheng Chui, along with four attendants sent by the Puppet Government, and swore an oath according to the old system. Pu Yi then took a piece of white silk, signed his name and stamped his seal on it. After the ceremony, at 2 PM, the bride and groom returned home," etc.</p>
<p>The marriage of young men and women is not a strange thing, but the marriage of Pu Yi's sister and Zheng Xiao-xu's grandson is somewhat meaningful. Let's talk about it today. Pu Yi and Zheng Xiao-xu were a bunch of foxes and dogs, and everyone knew they were running dogs of the Japanese and traitors to our country. The new organization of Puppet Manchuria was a live drama of puppets taking the stage. The romantic emperor actually looked like a romantic emperor, and the treacherous imperial relative actually looked like a treacherous imperial relative. But if you look at the back, everything is controlled by one person behind the scenes. These wooden figures are still dancing on the stage with self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to the big show, there's a small show. Pu Yi's eldest sister, Second Princess Yun He, has married Zheng Xiao-xu's grandson, Yi Kai. If we calculate it this way, Zheng Xiao-xu, who was once slapped by the Japanese, is actually the old imperial relative of Puppet Manchuria. Zheng Chui, who once tasted the flavor of Japanese gun butts, is actually the imperial relative of Puppet Manchuria. The incompetent Zheng Yi Kai is actually the imperial horse of Puppet Manchuria. [The whole family is powerful and enjoys the same fate as the country.] Today, Zheng Xiao-xu can be said to be extremely powerful and extremely glorious. Can it be tolerated?</p>
<p>When the live drama of Puppet Manchuria opened the other day, Pu Yi was nominally the Chief Executive, but Zheng Xiao-xu used the imperial system of three kneels and nine kowtows to pay homage to Pu Yi. At that time, I laughed at this old man for violating the world's trends and insisting on following Xuan Tong to advocate for restoration. It was only when the puppets took the stage that I realized that Zheng Xiao-xu had not kowtowed happily for twenty years and was somewhat uncomfortable. Now that there is a place to kowtow, isn't it satisfying? This time, Yi Kai and Yun He are married, and I think another opportunity to kowtow has arrived, because the imperial sister is marrying a slave, and he must kneel three times and kowtow nine times to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>However, there are two points that I would like to ask Mr. Zheng to pay attention to. The puppet organization in the Northeast is not recognized by our country, and it is not recognized by other countries either. This is not so important, and it can be temporarily [closed and changed the year number]. There is also one point that must be guarded against, that is, the palm of the giant spirit and the taste of Japanese-made gun butts.</p>

<h3 id="e114">War and Airplanes <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Zheng</p>
<p>In land warfare, defense can be set up with hundreds of miles of wire mesh, or sandbags can be piled up and deep trenches dug, and landmines buried; charging cavalry and infantry die before they get close. Even tanks rushing in cannot break through. In naval defense, electric nets can also be placed at the mouths of the coast, and submerged mines can be buried to prevent enemy warships and submarines and torpedoes, etc., but in the air, the area is extremely large and the high altitude is incalculable, making it impossible to defend effectively, and difficult to defend at all. Airplanes can take advantage of this, occupying the high ground and dropping bombs to destroy defenses, covering their own cavalry or infantry charges. Therefore, countries have recently been expanding their air forces, and General Zhang Xueliang of our country, on September 18, 1931, uniquely gifted more than two hundred airplanes to Japan. Airplanes have different uses in war, so they can be divided into bomber planes, fighter planes, and reconnaissance planes. I will now describe them separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Bomber planes are the largest of the three types, being able to carry heavy loads and fly in the air for long periods of time. The fuselage can be equipped with light artillery, machine guns, and bombs, etc. The weight of the bombs dropped ranges from half a ton to a ton (one ton equals two thousand pounds), but ordinary bombs, about one hundred and ten to two hundred and twenty pounds, can carry even more bombs. It is not only used for bombing, but also for long-distance reconnaissance. A typical bomber plane is forty-six feet long from head to tail and sixteen feet high. It can fly up to fifteen thousand seven hundred and forty-eight feet, and can reach more than six thousand five hundred and sixty feet in ten minutes. It can continuously fly for ninety hours. Its speed is only thirty miles per hour. Its own weight is five tons, so it flies very slowly, and when carrying heavy bombs, etc., its movements become even more clumsy and slow. We see the Japanese bomber planes slowly circling a few times before dropping bombs, because they are clumsy and difficult to aim at the target. It is easily chased and shot down by fighter planes, so it is also equipped with machine guns to counterattack, but it can never match the nimbleness of fighter planes, so bomber planes must have one or two fighter planes protecting them before they dare to come out and drop bombs. The one shot down at Zhenru this time was a Japanese bomber plane.</p>
<p>(2) Fighter planes are much smaller than bomber planes, and there are several types, including single-seater and double-seater. They are extremely nimble in flight and very convenient for combat. The latest single-seater fighter planes are equipped with a total of six light machine guns, two on the top and two on each side, and the procedure for adding bullets and firing is very convenient. Typically, they are about eighteen feet long and sixteen feet high. They can fly up to more than twenty-five thousand seven hundred feet, but at such a high altitude, the air is thin, and the driver must have an artificial oxygen respirator. It can rise to more than six thousand five hundred feet in five minutes, which is half as fast as a bomber plane. The speed is one hundred and fifty miles per hour, and the weight is only a little over one ton, but it can only fly continuously for two or three hours. Lieutenant Short, the American aviator who died for human justice, reportedly flew a single-seat fighter plane and shot down six Japanese planes in the skies over Suzhou. There is also a type of double-seat fighter plane, where one person drives the plane and the other person carries a light machine gun, which can be fired arbitrarily in all directions, and can also be fired upwards and downwards, with bullets falling like raindrops downwards.</p>
<p>(3) Reconnaissance planes can scout enemy movements and report to their own troops via radio. They also rely on the excellent modern cameras to take extremely clear pictures of the enemy from airplanes thousands of feet high, which can then be enlarged for easier examination and to calculate attack and defense. In the battle on the Longhai Railway between Jiang and Feng, the Central Air Force's reconnaissance planes took photos of the Feng army's defenses. I saw them in a magazine, and although they were reprinted on paper, they were still clear, with the curves of the trenches, the number of people and horses, and the distance of the gun positions all clearly visible. Jiang's army won a great victory because of the reconnaissance planes. As for their size, speed, and altitude, they are not much different from fighter planes. They can also be equipped with machine guns or carry bombs. For every type of offensive weapon, there is a type of defense. After airplanes were used in war, anti-aircraft artillery was invented to defend against them. Anti-aircraft artillery can be arbitrarily rotated in direction and can fire a large number of bullets in one second. It can also be mounted on cars to chase and shoot down airplanes.</p>
<p>With the rapid progress of modern radio technology, airplanes can fly at high altitudes without being piloted by humans, using wireless power to control the airplane, making it move forward, backward, rise, and descend. The intensity of its bombing and the clarity of its reconnaissance are more convenient and powerful than human piloting. There is also a particularly powerful invention of "light." If an airplane in the air is illuminated by a beam of white light, it will immediately burn into charcoal. If it carries gunpowder bombs, it will explode and scatter, disappearing without a trace, which is truly shocking. However, these military inventions are kept secret by all countries and are still under further research. Has our country also made any inventions, keeping them secret and still under research?</p>

<p>For several weeks, A Mao had been ordered by Lao Chuang to drive a truck out, so in the darkness of this late night, he had to drive to the dock to transport goods, which was not an exception, nor was it the first time after the war. As usual, the truck driver A Mao did not carry the goods, he just waited quietly for the truck to be fully loaded, and then drove off at full speed. Now he was sitting in his seat without making a sound, because he was constantly attacked by sleepiness, so he couldn't help cursing and saying…</p>
<p>"Damn it! If you want to sell, do it openly. Why be a treacherous merchant doing it so secretly?"</p>
<p>He didn't know how to solve the national crisis, and he wouldn't be able to draft any plan to save the country, but he had personally seen Japanese soldiers kill our people and burn our houses… All the brutal acts were deeply etched in his memory, so as soon as he mentioned the word "Eastern Ocean," it made him very angry.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a coolie got into the car and sat beside him, so he immediately knew that the goods were fully loaded and he was about to start moving forward. Suddenly, the coolie was wrinkling his nose, smelling the air, as if he had discovered a strange smell. Soon, he said to A Mao…</p>
<p>"Hey! Can you smell it? Where does this bloody smell come from?"</p>
<p>"Humph! Really, I smell it too."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he turned on the ignition, and the engine roared.</p>
<p>"Then, where does this bloody smell come from?" the coolie asked…</p>
<p>"Only God knows…"</p>
<p>The truck had begun to move, bumping along the road.</p>
<p>"Ah! I know," A Mao said again…</p>
<p>"This truck transported wounded soldiers on the front lines, and it's stained with a lot of blood!…"</p>
<p>Finally, he muttered to himself…</p>
<p>"Damn it! The blood of the soldiers hasn't dried yet, but Japanese goods are being imported in large quantities!"</p>

<p>Jiangwan University was innocently reduced to ashes in this battle. I think everyone has not forgotten this sad event concerning cultural damage!</p>
<p>Mr. R finally escaped two days before the Jiangwan battle; he temporarily took refuge at a relative's house in the concession.</p>
<p>Recently, he received the news that the university was moving to a safe area to start classes. Mr. R was of course happy, but he was also worried about the source of tuition fees, because he had been cut off from family letters for a long time and had no economic means. After planning all night, he had to bite the bullet and borrow a brand new Russian velvet blanket from his relatives, and… Mr. R happily harbored a thought: such a good velvet blanket could be pawned for at least ten dollars. Besides paying the tuition fee of eighteen yuan and the registration fee of one yuan, there were other expenses… He unknowingly stepped into the pawnshop</p>
<p>door.</p>
<p>After the shop owner carefully looked at it, turning it over and over, he turned his face to Mr. R and said… "This velvet blanket can be pawned for three dollars, what do you think!" Wanting to "pawn it for ten dollars," Mr. R said with a frightened and somewhat pleading look,</p>
<p>Ha, ha, you can't pawn it for that much, you can't pawn it for that much,</p>
<p>Boss, please don't get me wrong, this velvet blanket was indeed bought in Harbin for thirty-four dollars, and it hasn't been used for long. Because I'm short of tuition fees, I'm willing to pawn it off cheaply, I really have no choice,</p>
<p>Humph! You're strange, I've been eating this pawnshop meal for a full sixteen years, what could be wrong or not wrong. To be honest, you can bring diamonds, pearls, and gems, but they're</p>
<p>not in my eyes, they're only worth three dollars,</p>
<p>Alas! I'm sorry, please…"</p>
<p>"…What's there to be sorry about, if you don't want to pawn it, then forget it. Can you add a little?" Boss! Forgive me, then, I'll add four "eight opens" [probably refers to a type of currency], please… please… I'm sorry, in this turbulent situation, we'd better… if you don't want to pawn it, go… go… go"</p>
<p>Oh! Forget it, pawn it, pawn it!</p>
<p>Unknowingly, the sun was setting in the west, and his stomach was rumbling. Mr. R ignored it as if he were fighting with his stomach, always thinking about tomorrow being the last day of the school's tuition deadline! But how to solve the problem of these few yuan of tuition fees that are not enough? Alas! Pawnshop owner,</p>
