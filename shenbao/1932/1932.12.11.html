<p>— 誠</p>
<p>蘇炳文將軍所部自今年十月間樹立義旗崛起於滿洲里而後曾聯絡馬占山張殿久諸部縱橫北滿屢建奇績使日軍之鐵蹄未能輕易踏入北滿興安嶺頭猶能飄揚靑天白日之旗幟艱苦奮鬭歷時數月迄於最近乃終以彈盡援絕敵軍有增無已而不得不忍痛退入蘇聯國界解除武裝退師之通電中有曰「本軍仗義誓師本不　背城借一全歸殉國獨念地方民衆　禍兩月饑溺已　倘再堅抗勢將同歸於盡無補事功」悲壯激越一字一淚而仁人之心尤盎然見於紙上至謂「假道回國另行工作與敵周旋一息尙存此志不懈」則更斬釘截鐵如聞其聲如見其人嗚呼將軍以彈盡援絕而退矣敵旗迎風飄揚以入滿洲里我一千五百餘里之版土至此又全淪入敵騎蹂𨈆之下矣吾人引領北望有不悲憤不能自已者耶�</p>
<p>夫絕域孤軍久抗强敵雖各部義軍猶能時相呼應而敵軍日增我援不繼槍械利鈍勢尤殊縣以疲敵之師當虎狼之敵而又冰天雪地飢寒併迫欲不敗不退决不能即將軍起義時通電中所謂「成敗利鈍非所計及」殆亦早知今日之退却爲意料以内之事吾人廻想去冬馬占山將軍江橋之退却與夫今春滬戰中十九路軍及第五軍之忍痛撤師則蘇炳文將軍此次之退入蘇境要亦爲勢所必至抑且蘇將軍即退而北滿各部義軍尙多敵騎正亦未必遂容任意縱橫獨是吾人所悲憤不能自遏者則自東省事變爆發以迄今茲國事蜩螗依然如昨義軍之奮鬭正艱國内之混戰不已關外之難民流離轉徒關内之人民則歌舞正酣舉國上下大難臨頭而不關心若纺巢飛幕而不自知危蘇將軍今日之撤退與去冬馬將軍之撤退其爲彈盡援絕如出一轍吾人誠不解我四萬萬五千萬之人民又何爲者</p>
<p>自東北禍變爆發以來歷時逾歲情勢旣日臻於危難公理更全爲强權所呑沒今次國聯會議再開所謂中日問題亦惟有三數小國尙肯作仗義之言至於大國仍持遷延敷衍之態度縱橫椑闔各懷鬼胎沉默觀變莫肯作正義之發言而日本則一再悍然宣示於大會曰請「靜觀」靜觀者何斯即假以時間當即可盪平我義軍底定東省全局之意彼之「靜觀」爲「進取」我之靜觀則爲「待死」死臨眉睫猶不動心在「靜觀」之下蘇將軍所部又已被擊破矣行見我艱難苦鬭之三省義軍在彈盡援絕之情形下將逐次爲强敵所各個擊破此次蘇將軍之敗退不過爲整個破滅之開頭吾人果將「持死」耶吾人果將坐待日人嚢括我全版圖俘獲我全民族以傲然誇示於國聯會議之席上耶</p>
<p>然蘇將軍雖退而東北猶尙有無數之蘇將軍在也懲前毖後國人今茲猶尙不投袂而起乎</p>

<p>（北平）蘇炳文部退入俄境後、中央有電到平除探詢行止外並致慰問、平方已轉電駐莫斯科中國代表團、請其轉達蘇炳文、並請就近代爲辦理蘇部通過俄境手續、（十日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）蘇炳文張殿九謝珂金奎璧等仍在赴莫京途中、平方接謝珂電稱、預定下星期三四抵俄京、稍躭擱即轉德美、再往日内瓦、向國聯報吿、蘇炳文眷屬等已到海參嵗、日内轉滬來平、（十日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據官場宜露、日政府會於數日前正式申請蘇俄政府引渡蘇炳文將軍、即由加拉罕切實拒絕、於是日政府復於上二月九日第二次申請蘇俄政府担保蘇炳文將軍不離俄境、不作宣傳活動、現尙未接覆、衆料蘇俄仍將拒絕、因顯已准蘇離俄也、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（長春）關東軍司令部接到小松原大佐報吿謂俄領答覆、謂蘇聯政府法津、明定有保護政治犯之責任、故不能應日軍之要求、聞日軍即電請日外部、由外交部令駐俄天羽代理大佐、向蘇聯外交委員</p>
<p>會接治移交抗日將領問題、據摶日方欲以不侵犯條約爲交換條件、並主張蘇炳文等非政治犯、係殺日僑之殺人犯、須恨據世界刑事犯交換條約爲例引交日本、日方之懼怕抗日將領可謂至極矣、（十日華聯社電）</p>

<p>（南京）外交界息、十九國委會定十二日下午三時半（上海時間下午十時半）開會、决邀請美俄參加組調解會進行調解、日方雖反對美俄參加、但决不能阻止其實現、聞十九國委會開會時、將請中日代表參加、故我代表仍留居日内瓦云、（十日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據今日發表之和序、十九國特委會定期星期日重行開會、通過决議案、向國聯大會建議邀請美俄兩國參加解决中日爭案之談判、預料大會將决議照此辦理、然後即宣吿延會至明年　月中旬、衆信中國代表團對於國聯以延宕手段處置如此重要緊急之案件、將提出抗議、（十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據傳二十國會議之美俄代表、美國將任台維斯俄國則任李諾維夫參加、中日參加與否尙未决定、（十日華聯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會定星期一日集會、考慮請美俄參加調解中日爭議工作之問題、關於此事之决議、必須由國聯大會核准之、故大會將於星期二日或星期三日召集、國聯今尙未出困難之途、因美國或將要求國聯對於原則有所表示、然後始允參加也、有若干方面建議决議案須以在談判時不得承認滿洲國爲根據而成立之、但觀於日本之態度、此舉難免引起大會中新衝突也、其他方面主張無條件的邀請美俄參加、（九日路透電、）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）希孟因處理部務遄返比京、將由國聯大會名譽主席瑞士代表穆塔、代理十九國委員主席、以主持會務、據聞該委員會將舉行非公開會議、中日兩國代表須俟該委員會遇有聽取其意見之必要時、始乃參加、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）官塲　電、美國將否參加調解委員會、須視委託之條欵及該委員會與國聯正確之關係而定、日外務省已以對十九特委員之態度明白電達日内瓦、重行聲明不能承認任何决議拘束之效力、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）九日國聯大會選舉法國愛文諾氏爲國聯秘書長、繼任即將退休之德魯蒙氏、按新秘書長愛文諾氏生於一八七九年、歐戰之際爲法國駐英大使館經濟參贊、後被任爲法國最高經濟評議委員會委員、歐戰之後曾屢次代表法國出席各重要國際會議、一九一三年被任爲國聯副秘書長、在國聯秘書廳服務幾近十年、逐獲陞任今職云、</p>
<p>（日内瓦）我國首席代表顏惠慶昨函十九國特委會主席希孟、請確實决定特委會向大會提出解决中日爭案建議之時限、並吿以除非日本改變其不可理喩之態度、和解絕尠成功之希望云、（十日中央社電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）今日從極可靠方面聞悉、倘英人目前之解决運動、仍屬失敗後、則英國準備對於日本適用國聯盟約第十六條中之制裁、惟在採用此極端辦法以前、外相西門固將竭盡種種可能方法、亟謀調解、因此西門準備倡議邀中日與俄美均參加十九國委員會工作、即四國不能參加實際討論至少亦當列席爲旁聽員、倘此種企圖猶復失敗、則渠準備向英政府建議採用盟約所規定之最儼厲方法（十日國民社電）</p>
<p>按第十六條之制度、即㈠經濟封鎖、㈡由行政院向各會員建議派遣陸海空軍組織軍隊維護盟約、㈢宣吿令其出會、</p>

<p>（日内瓦）路透從負責方面探悉外傳英國準備於調解運動不成時、援用國聯盟約第十五條所規定之制裁加諸日本一說、未　根據、大約此項傳言由於英外相西門在大會中演詞之誤解、蓋西門曾謂英政府欲以國聯忠實會員之資格行事也、（十日路透電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）國聯大會已閉幕、此次决議空洞、不着實際、尤不若去年九月三十日及十二月十日兩次决議案之尙能敷衍門面、聞此次會議之結果、與英國態度之轉變有極大關係、英代表西門之演說、對我頗多不利之處、而其屬加拿大代表更進而投井下石、各小國對此次决議極不滿、認大會未根據李頓報吿之忠實紀載、及去年决議案之精神、予日本以制裁使國聯盟約尊嚴與維持正義威信、受極大打擊云（十日中央社電）</p>

<p>（南京）記者今遍訪外交界各要人、叩詢對此次國聯大會之意見、均顯然表示失望、自開幕以來、雖均以李頓報吿爲討論根據而决議案竟如此空洞、誠屬不解、至於九一八事變之責任與不承認「滿洲國」、亦不加以具體决議、最爲遺憾、於兩次决議日軍撤退顯已忘却、此與國聯威信影響極大、各要人稱政府雖靜觀十九國委員會之進展、但對中日爭端之解决、已不寄完全希望於國聯之身、如國聯不能爲世界和平正義作保障、則國人應發揮自已之力量、謀失地之收復、深信經濟絕交與義軍抵抗爲合法手段、如能長此堅持、定能獲最後之勝利云、（十日中央社電）</p>

<p>追悼淞滬殉難四童子軍大會宣言云、一二八戰役以後、中國童子軍歷史上、便多了一頁可歌可泣的光榮故事、事實是這樣的殘酷的日本、好亂成性垂涏着東北的肥沃、藉口自衛、强行侵佔了、還不算數、又起野蠻之師、蹂𨈆上海幹了�</p>
<p>一番殺人放火折勾當、它的意思無非是轉移世界的目光、一方面便於暗暗地完成它數十年來所蓄念的詭計的初步計劃、設立傀儡國、忠勇的十九路　第五軍等、爲維持人類的正義、圖民族的生存、便不顧一切、起來抵抗、同時我們童子軍、眼看着無數同胞、無辜慘殺、受了責任心的驅使、根據童子軍第二條、隨時隨地扶助他人、服務公衆的誓詞、就抛棄了個人的職業和家庭很迅速地组織了一個戰地服務團、輔佐着紅十字會、出生入死於槍林彈雨之中、挽救了不少受難的同胞的生命、但是不幸、五十團的羅雲祥·應文達·鮑正武·毛微祥·四位同志、便因此遭倭奴之擄捉、强指爲間牒而慘殺、忠骸至今尙未有着落、一個不帶色彩抱着力求世界和平爲宗旨的童子軍、臂上套着爲國際公法訂定所不許仇視的紅十字會的標識、而竟遭慘殺、實屬創聞、這樣看來、殘暴的日本、不僅中國單方面的　人亦是世界上任何各國的公敵、要是使世界公道存在的話、就得對日本人羣起而攻之、本來各國經濟巩慌自顧不暇、那來閑情逸致管别人家的事呢我們究竟是中國人、唇亡齒寒、休戚相關、所以最後的勝利還仗着自策自勵、努力去奮鬥、萬不能口裏呐喊着紙上呼簫着、做些無益實際的事情、現在上海事體、雖然表面上已是雲烟過眼、依然　歌酣舞、城開不夜、度那繁華的生活、但是戰區刦灰、仍是暴露着絲毫沒有抺去、東北義勇軍、還是拿着陳舊的軍械、穿着單薄的衣服在冰天雪地中、繼續幹抗日工作、所以我們目前最大的任務、便是秉先烈的遺志、雪恥救國、雖不能執着槍桿兒到前線去、但也得至少做些扶傷救死、爲人類服務的工作、把童子軍果毅的精神、盥情發揚、職任所在、雖死不辭、我們對於這殉難的四位同志、撫念忠烈、益慚後死、除爲各家屬設法撫恤外、由五十團呈准主辦機關上海市商會、建了一個紀念塔、旌表義軍、將來决定在上海市中心區、造一個衣冠墓、以垂不朽、一方面可以免得烈士的忠魂無依另一方面也可給後人景仰、現在又得中國童子軍總會的命令、着上海特别市童子軍理事會、舉行這個盛大的追悼會、承蒙各界賜以挽聯誄詞、很是感激、今後非但我們童子軍時刻要認淸目標、努力去做、還望各界人士、與以更深切的同情恊助、使四烈遺志得伸、人類大敵得除、救民族於垂危、臻世界於人同、謹此宣言</p>

<h3 id="c116">張雲秋女士所提問題討論之結果 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>張雲秋女士原提問題···㈠爲什麽無數的夫妻會凡愛情的沸點降落到零度？㈡這樣的悲劇有什麽方法可以補救？</p>
<p>討論的總結：我們認定，張女士所提出之問題，實爲一社會問題，與現實社會制度息息相聯。在整個社會制度未得改革，整個社會問題未得解决之前，此種局部的問題，决不能得到圓滿的解决，即能，亦不過爲「脚痛醫脚」，「頭痛治頭」，就令你所投的藥能偶然醫好一隻脚，一個頭，但，這並不足以說明你所投的藥是醫一切的脚，一切的頭的特效仙丹。</p>
<p>夫妻的愛情所謂由沸點降到冰點究竟是爲了什麽呢許多來函的答覆是：爲了男子喜新厭舊，爲了未能體認戀愛的眞諦，爲了婚後生活的壓迫，爲了女子經濟不能獨立，爲了雙方未能互相深切了解，還有人拿「蜜多了不甜」及「鐘錶走久了發條自會鬆」做譬喻，認爲夫妻愛情之鬆弛是事所必至，理所固然。如像上述的種種意見，當然都是十二分的對，但，這裏都並沒有把握住問題的重心，沒有找着眞實的根因，如上所說的還只是「果」，我們應該更進一步再追究　些「果」的來源。</p>
<p>也許有人對這意見不能同意罷！那末我便得問；爲什麽女子經濟不能獨立呢？爲什麽某一部分的人應該感受生活的壓迫呢？爲什麽容許男子們喜新厭舊呢？假如你不再找出一個根因，那末，除了拿什麽「天命論」或是「極端的唯心論」之類來覇蠻解釋而外，你能正確地解答這些問題嗎？</p>
<p>···········································</p>
<p>自從財產私有制度確立，男子成爲社會的中心而後，女子則已由「自由人」而淪爲變相的奴隷，變相的財產，她只是男子的「婦」，並不是一個「社會人」，質言之，她是「男子的」，而不是「社會的」，她沒有自由，沒有意志，她不能與男子立於平等的地位，起居飲食，都仰給男子，所以男子可以「憐新棄舊」，可以見「異」即思「遷」，可以拿自已的愛憎來决定女子的命運。丨丨假如我們要從心理上去解擇第一個問題的話，便應該基於此一觀察去體認分判。</p>
<p>其次，如果我們說夫妻情感的降落是由於「生活逼迫」，這尤其很顯明的此一事實是與社會制度發生親密的聯緊。假使這社會中人人做事，人人都有飯吃，如樣孫中山先生所說的三民主義社會的最後階段一樣，則斷不至有某一部分人獨感受生活逼迫的事實發生，也斷不至由此而引起夫妻間的悲劇。所以，這一點上去解釋這個問題，我們尤其應該正確地把握住　　　觀念。</p>
<p>然而我們究竟是現實社會裏的人，社會之改革旣不是一時一刻可以實現的事，則對於眼前的悲劇，我們亦斷不能不盡人力去謀補救，就算是頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，但假使偶然能醫好一隻脚一個頭，也未嘗不是一件快事。</p>
<p>這裏，我們歸納三百多封來信的意見，作成一個補救的方案列下：</p>
<p>㈠在結婚之前，雙方須互相深切了解；㈡雙方應以理智爲基礎，不宜純感情化；㈢雙方須互相尊重人格，不可取玩侮的態度；㈣雙方宜求生活獨立，宜節儉；㈤雙方宜注意生理上的健康；㈥雙方宜互相原諒，宜常回味往日的情愛；㈦如其可能，宜常作小别離；㈧如絕對不相容洽，即實行離婚。</p>

<p>足球界之不幸</p>
<p>史高塔杯賽第二週之一幕、優游對蘭開夏、昨日在棒球塲交鋒、優游形勢極佳、似有獲勝希望、不謂於連勝兩球之後、竟然自矣兩球、後又被蘭開夏攻入一球、比數成二比三、優游反居下屬、固猶不難反敗爲勝、但下半時中、因裁判員執法不嚴、球員動作失檢、優游並屢與裁判員爲難、竟有表示不績賽之態度、曾暫停比賽二三分鐘、經深明大義之陳劭君、極力勸解、各球員乃繼續比賽、安知最後比賽尙餘六七分鐘時、優游竟不能維持其短促之時間、就此不終而散、裁判員亦無辦法、其結果是否成立、須待西聯會當局解决之、</p>
<h3 id="c163">先勝兩球自送兩球 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>鐘鳴三下、優游開球先攻、聲勢極盛、在二十五分鐘内、由王章寳連勝兩球、一時喜形於色、不覺精神倍增、但蘭開夏從容不迫、努力反攻、於是優游門前、危險不脫、且時露慌亂不整之象、梁宮　首先請客、自已攻入一球、事有凑巧、可謂無獨有偶、爲時無幾、優游朱　、在門前頂球、球向後而滑復着董小培之頭、而滾入自已門内、阿梁不及防備、又失一球、於是優游元氣大傷、抱恨不已、</p>
<h3 id="c164">再負一球優游命傷 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>上半時結果、成二比二後、下半時開始不久、蘭開夏右冀凱芝又中一球、成三比二、優游反勝爲敗、從此球賽形勢、不堪入目、不料優游竟有不願續賽之表示、而留下高級球隊之汚點、</p>
<h3 id="c165">裁判不嚴禍之由來 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>昨日之比賽、球員熏動作之野蠻、較日前曁南與東華、有過之無不及、優游之不終而散、亦出於意料之外、然歸根結　、由於裁判員執法不嚴、在此種形勢之中如嚴判執法如山、不容絲毫放鬆、則球員旣不能踢人不踢球、而半途退場之事、亦不致發生、至於球隊方面、更應抱「人不犯我、我不犯人」之規律、更應寛容大肚、捐除虚榮心、則不幸事件、可以免矣、華人球隊、一再于外人以不良之印象、曷勝浩歎</p>
<h3 id="c166">看客無禮亦一原因 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>近來球場上、每有少數、不良看客、呼么喝六、助成球場空前、並有造成不　事件之可能、昨日優游之事、一半亦屬少數不良看客所造成、助優游退場、離比賽時間、僅六七分鐘、觀衆竟向恊進會要求退票、無理取閙、於此益顯、甚望熱心觀衆、與華隊球員、切切再勿意氣用事、總須在球藝上着想、少演越軌行動、免予外人　笑、自堕人格、而辱國體、</p>

<p>[P西捕射門不佳&gt;</p>
<p>西捕幾科全在法间門前打門、後衛平平、惠斯和大爲賣力、前鋒兩翼及　克出色、但派克推納之射門大惡劣、失去之打空門機會不可計、</p>
<h3 id="c169">法商先開紀錄 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>上半時法商於十五分鐘後、由法加之傳球、推納之失足、馬賽爾傳法凡怯、由絡萊脫射中、先勝一球、快而美、甚受鼓掌、竟不料此後之一敗途地、</p>
<h3 id="c170">西捕連中六隻 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>西捕其後雖圍攻不已、終不能進、一次派克在門前三尺、一射於左衛身上彈回、上半時將完畢之十分鐘内、傑克連中二球、派克加上一次、三比一西捕隊勝、下半時之最後十分鐘、派克又中、傑克繼之、派克終造成六比一之在勝、</p>

<p>人以江善敬勇則勇矣、獨惜其有過野失脚之虞、乃最近數戰、大見進步、快如飛燕、穩如泰山、昨得顧尙勷之恊助、竟能應付裕如、當接觸之初、曁南以柱石徐亞輝之缺席、軍心不無震動、敵方乘此弱點、大舉入攻、彼時曁南門前、不時發現敵跡、江顧雖盡力抵禦、功不可沒、然臘克斯射，擊惡劣、亦難勝紀、忽然劉祖侃向空挑射門前、前鋒如潮湧進、敵方内衛守者亦望風而至、球見</p>
<p>作怪、自雙方脚𨻶間、一躍入網、得失二方、均瞠目不知所云、曁南勝得此球、似爲當日勝利之預兆、</p>

<p>臘克斯隊發現新將一位、名范士、前歲曾在港滬埠賽中露面、刻居該隊中堅要職、觀其技術之高超、將來必可替代軋許地位、彼時渠見曁南内衛難破、守門易欺、乃改用遠射法、一次離五十碼處、正由上門柱落入、一次離四十餘碼、亦自左角中的、謝全和如能早起準備、保無遺患、乃計不及此、上半時竟以一對二失手、</p>
<p>梅洪寳人小脚快</p>

<p>曁南中锋羅海光、近日成績平庸、但於下半時關場後之五分鐘、憑其膽力、奪得入球、挾之進攻顧敵救兵將至、乃急中生智、轉移右方、梅洪寳業有凖備、飛步追至、脚到球出、如矢直入、造成二對二和局、嗣後曁南聲色俱厲、大非昔比、臘克斯門前、從此多事、守門心膽俱驚、幾見失陷、江善敬一次踢任意球、效法范恩士、逕取龍門、彈柱復回、梅氏頂越門外、好事多磨、忽被培克左邊陷入、橫射門内、臘克斯又以三對二占先、</p>

<p>足球······金陵與蕙蘭</p>
<p>籃球······約翰與滬江</p>
<p>江浙私立九中學足籃球賽、於日昨起在本埠梵王渡約輪大學舉行經兩日之逐鹿、已至緊關頭、籃球得决賽權者爲約翰與滬江附中足球由金陵附中與蕙蘭中學决賽今日無比賽、冠軍亞軍、均於星期一解决、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c188">足球組 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>㈠金陵蕙蘭得錦標組决赛權</p>
<p>金陵四比零勝滬江　初賽中金陵曾以十七比零大勝萃英、而滬江則以六比三勝之江、故金陵滬江兩隊、實力均强、昨日舉行複賽、有極精彩之表演、但金陵前鋒、殊爲饒勇短傳遞頗爲出色、後衛防禦、亦甚周密、滬江竟望風披靡、結果金陵以四比零勝、得决賽權、</p>
<p>蕙蘭二比一勝宴城　第一日蕙蘭曾以三比二勝約翰、宴城則以三比零勝桃塢、蕙蘭宴城、乃於昨日會逢於複賽中、兩隊除表演、亦有可觀、結果蕙蘭以二比一淘汰宴城、競爭形勢、顧見劇烈、蕙蘭乃得與金陵相會於决賽中</p>
<p>㈡約翰之江得落選組决賽權</p>
<p>之江二比零勝萃英　落選組複賽第一組、爲之江對萃英、經九十分鐘之角逐、之江以二比零勝、而得落選組之决賽權</p>
<p>約翰八比零勝桃塢　另一組落選組複簪爲約翰對桃塢、約翰實力頗强初賽以二比三不幸敗於蕙蘭、但落選錦標（卽亞軍）、極有希望、昨以八比零勝桃塢、約翰乃與之江相會於落選决賽中</p>
<p>㈢冠軍亞軍金陵約翰最有望</p>
<p>此次足球錦標、金陵附中最有希望、良以該隊實力、極爲强勁、約翰附中當不難獲落選决賽之優勝、將來與錦標决賽失敗者决亞軍時、約翰亦不難操得勝劵、故亞軍一席、當以約翰最有希望</p>
<h3 id="c189">籃球組 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>㈠約翰滬江得錦標組决賽權</p>
<p>約翰淘汰晏城　籃球方面以約翰附中實力最强、初賽曾以五十二比十二勝之江、昨日與晏城複賽（晏城以四十一比二十淘汰桃塢於初賽中、結果以八十九比十歸約翰大勝、</p>
<p>滬江戰勝明强　滬江籃球實力亦精、初賽輪空、昨與淘汰金陵（四十八比二十八</p>
<p>之明强隊複賽、經一番劇戰、滬江卒壓倒明强而得决賽權、結果爲三十六比二十八</p>
<p>㈡金陵之江得落選組决賽權</p>
<p>金陵因敗於明强、而明强復敗於滬江、於是明强淘汰、金陵得落選組决賽權、另一組之江對桃塢之落選組複賽、於昨晚舉行、兩隊實力懸殊、結果之江以三十三比二大勝、</p>
<p>㈢冠軍亞軍約翰滬江最有望</p>
<p>籃球錦標當以約翰附中最有希望、滬江卽使不能奪得錦標、當可佔取亞軍地位、今日無比賽、明日結束解决一切、</p>
<p>西靑籃天驚人消息滬江敗於南星二七比三十···三分慘敗</p>
<h3 id="c190">錦標希望不無打擊 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>其他三甲組　持志勝海軍</p>
<p>夏光勝江灣　靑光勝也是</p>
<p>滬江籃球隊、在此次西靑籃球賽中、大有打倒海賊奪取錦標之雄心、不料尙在中途、卽遭挫折、當頭一棒、竟於昨晚、失敗於南星之手、三十比二十七相差三分、雖然、將來如能擊敗海賊、常勝不敗、尙有希望在也、其他三場甲組結果、持志勝美海軍、四十比二十一、夏光勝江灣、四十三比二十七、靑光勝也是、六十三比三十一、乙組二場、東吳二中勝美公、二十七比十四、晚星勝法學院、二十五比二十、</p>
<p>滬江竟遭慘敗</p>
<h3 id="c191">南星大有進步 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>南星之勝滬江、當然亦非悻致、昨晚表演、顯示其有特殊之進步、進退迅速、守衛嚴密、使滬江前鋒、雖勇猛而不能施其技、進攻時楚楚有致、不慌不亂、是其得得之由、</p>
<h3 id="c192">滬江致命之傷 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>滬江之失敗、表演减色、無所諱飾、因後衛之不密、時爲南星漏入、前鋒亦隨之動搖、吳國霖雖仍其舊、而馮念華亦有擲不中、最大致命之傷、爲大將錢敬鏞、上揚不及十分鐘、卽以四次犯規罰出、陳線大爲熏搖、吳國霖孤軍奮鬥、亦難挽大局矣、</p>
<h3 id="c193">南星一躍而起 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>初雖接戰良烈、然滬江仍居優勢、以七比五居先、南星經劉甚湛之二中一罰、遂以十比七一躍而起、十四比八、滬江錢敬鏞罰出、南星之勢更盛、上半時南星以十八比十、超出八分之多、</p>
<h3 id="c194">雙方短兵相見 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>下半時起、滬江經吳國霖之二次遠射中的、分數立</p>
<p>見接近、十七比十八僅差一分、再接再厲、滬江奮命進攻、分數乃爲一分之上下、互相起落、全場緊張、而滬江馮念華因三次犯規、不啻加上一層束縛、勝負難測、俱爲滬江揑冷汗、</p>
<h3 id="c195">最後之五分鐘 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>尙餘五分鐘、滬江以吳國霖之一中、以二十六比二十四居上二分、南星包新第又一擲而成平后、尙有二分鐘、南星以二十八比二十七超出一分、孫寳慶得罰球機會、二擲皆失、一轉身、孫反而四次犯規罰出、滬江勢已不救、終局結果、三十比二十七、南星獲勝、</p>

<p>（金山枝）「裝法」每箱五十磅、起運　使、破箱較少、斤量損失不多、「身骨」大都烘焙乾足、不易霉蛀、可以久貯、「貨品」甜味較足而鮮嫩、粒子匀整、　較小之粒子、其形圓、肉厚亦可食、</p>
<p>（蘭彺枝）「裝法」每箱百斤左右、起運上落、箱子易破、斤量捐失亦多、「身骨」烘焙圓有不足、水份不盡、則易霉蛀、間或火候太烈則肉色發黑、味即帶苦、過與不及、皆難久貯、均非所宜、最好生晒使乾、則壳肉鮮艷可愛、但遇陰雨天、非烘焙不可、故仍須注重於烘法也、「貨品」甜味較遜、生長不足者、兼有微酸、肉份不及其嫩如出水佳時、則小核厚肉、足補其短所年不及者、粒子參差不一、小粒形尖、肉薄無味、徒具形式而已、</p>
<p>查今庚漳產蘭竹枝、收成平常、故出新時地價較高、不甚合銷、旋因金山枝湧到步跌、　爲軋脚、復因貨品尖粒太多、銷路幾等於零、及至現在、不特售價退居金山枝之　、而銷路呆滯如故其主要原因、實由於貨品不純所致、　市疲之際、貨　尤宜　超　方能佔得地位、否則無有不失敗者也、</p>

<p>昨粉市上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈穩定之象、以洋麥報價、祇互有數分上落、故初開時、市氣平平、惟各廠依然觀望、交易甚寂、迨至下午開盤、交易似見略暢、因大連帮現粉去胃、又稍活動、期貨亦稍有收進、廠方情形、阜豐因現貨尙俏、收進近期、惟遠期則套出甚　、至福新聞近期回出、遠期不動、所以各盤市氣、雖呈俏勢、漲度則無幾也、惟本埠現粉、喊價過昂、津帮未　多定邊粉、似孚廠家須改變態度、方無後顧憂也、結果本月份較前日微好二厘半、一月份好五厘、二月份好一分二厘半、三月份不動、四月份好七厘半、五月份好二厘半云、</p>

<p>丨本麥存底極單薄丨</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份致呈盤旋之象、因洋麥報價、上落甚微、人心自少轉動、惟本麥存底甚薄、各廠頗思問津、交易所之籌碼、當然稀少、所謂物稀爲貴、業中心思、自覺堅定、遠期因微有洋麥套頭、市氣亦穩、結果本月份無比較、一月份好一分、二月份小一分、三四月份各好一分云、</p>

<p>（新閘）昨日各帮來源三十餘號、市銷一蹶不振、北粳交易不旺、市形平淡、洋杜尖連日猛漲、因到頭寥寥、减起角許、早晚稻到接銷平與厚粳同趨穩勢、變元胃品不化、而到頭不多、坐定之象、</p>

<p>￣小絞跌二角客秈疲五分　￣</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、續形疲軟、因客秈到源續有、客化去胃不旺、存底漸多、市形步軟、南洋帮近因河下米將有流通之實行、乃撌守觀望、北洋帮完全停頓、此後只有注意於河下粳米、本街更無進胃、行情立卽步跌、貨主亦肯貶價脫手、客户以價格低落、始有問訊、統市由福州·泉州辦去湖南機紅米三百廿包、價七元九角、又機油二百包、價八元七角半至八元七角、均比前日回小五分以上、本街去小絞一百五十包、價七元六角、則較小有二角云、</p>

<p>邇來洋莊絲市、愈趨愈下、歐美經濟衰落、日本絲與人造絲相互侵銷、致華絲銷路一蹶不振白廠絲去電均嫌價昂而不轉、各廠商手中存絲日厚、資金周轉無方、勢難維持、無錫本爲絲繭中心區域、全邑絲廠共有五十家、今歲新繭上市後、開工者有二十餘家、茲因絲銷疲澢益甚、停</p>

<p>柏油自漢口跌後、本埠銷場仍呆、惟浙江方面反因供不敷求、市面與漢口背道面馳、　見　新之際、各因環境而互異也、乃據漢口來電、市面又跌、據重荆已開十二兩平　紋、津市　祇十一兩、江河日下、勢似已倒狂灡、但浙油依然挺秀北跌南漲、實出常理之外、惟因浙油祇關係一隅之地非若漢市之籠罩全局、且本埠市面、素以漢市之馬首是　、故浙油縱有聲勢絕不稍受影響、而售價仍依漢市而跌、銷場或可因此引起、更可通行於浙境也、</p>

<p>白桐油自漢口洋莊十七兩七八錢後、交易時斷時續、無蹊景可言、據昨漢函所詳、　　來源不少、致市面疲弱、行家批出祇十三兩四錢洋例文、本埠號家、在前向杭州行家辦過一批期貨、每砠自二十三元三四角迄二十二元六七角、今因漢市見跌、浙方雖尙可維持、然辦者興味、不若前者之濃厚矣、故近日已漸入觀望態度、惟據各產地、因成本關係、而售不肯過廉、因是浙桐似在入定的狀態中、但漢市價雖見跌、銷場仍未能引動、再跌旣未可能、轉機亦非其時、尙有一時間之穩定可期也、</p>

<p>自由談	短篇小說竊鈎者流（一）  朱　　肚子裏沒有東西喫下去咕咕的呌得啓響，他們走在那些比白天還亮的馬路上，心裡眞有點兒不耐煩，紅的綠的，亮亮的，光光的，喫的跟用的東西那麽多，可是他們只能看，一點兒沒好處，這樣的走去，心裏就祇有恨啦。他們便揀着電燈光幽暗的地方走，拐彎抹角的經過幾條路，眞的走到一處很暗的地方了。這條路是用小石子砌成的，遠不及方縱走過的柏油路那麽平滑。電燈是那樣零落，不知是些什麽屋子，門都關緊了。也有幾家在狹小的門口，跳動着一盞半明半暗的燈，朦朧地映照出××大旅社幾個紅字或黑字。還有一些什麽樓什麽菜館的招牌，怪油膩的吊在那兒；小雜貨舖子裡的電燈，在宽條街上倒是挺亮的。幾條黝黑的弄口，有烘燒餅的攤子，兩三個滿臉油光的漢子坐在長凳上，像猴子那樣的，一隻脚卷起了，蹲着長凳的一邊，兩手緊抱住膝頭，那神氣都　瞌睡過半天的樣子。　　「這裏看來可以了。」　　「好，還行過去一點兒，總要揀個可以脚挺手伸的地方，沒有東西喫　也　，好好睡一覺到明天再說吧！」　　他們自家可也難怪了，這兩句無力的話，散在空間就那麽淸晰而寒顫。走近一處較闊的石級邊，三得拉拉大發的衣角，一轉身就倒在地上。　　「三得，我說這兒倒眞是好地方。」　　三得把兩脚挺得怪直的，只覺得一節節骨頭全舒服，讓大發的話在寂靜中散開去，沒有回答。却猛的把大發的屁股踼一脚，連大發也兩脚挺直地躺着了。　　「見鬼，把老子踼着幹麽？」大發駡三得。　　「呌你睡舒服點，把個屁股屈着幹麽？」　　大發才沒有話，又翻了一個身。隔不上幾分鐘，兩個人的鼾聲　一起響着了。大發見到那些高高的烟囱，一堆堆工廠的屋子。一個年靑的工人在吿訴他許多事情，他的心好像給什麽東西扯得緊緊的，連呼吸也忍着，一邊　一邊　在心裡想。正在那麽屏息的時候，聽　拍拍兩下極淸脆的聲響，把那個年靑工人不知怎的趕走了，他立刻睜開眼，尋個淸楚，接着又聽到巡捕警笛的尖銳聲音，才突的坐了起來，看看四面是條薄暗的街，什麽工廠和工人，一起是一個夢。有　　　影在他　　閃過，　着又接連的響幾下。他不懂道是怎麽一回事。把三得推着又不醒，回　看見一　　子門口站着兩個人，嘴裡還說着他所聽不懂的話，大發就耐不信問了：　　「有甚麽事啦？」　　一個中年人把頭回過來，做一個討厭的神氣，仍舊把頭轉了過去。　　「捉瘪三，丨捉强盜！」另一個年輕些的接着對大發說。　　他很想看看捉强盜是怎麽個樣兒，看見前面又有人跑過，就跟着也向那一邊跑去。睏了一些時候，不知那來的這麽在氣力，他追上了那個人，向右邊轉彎，這兒的街道更黑暗了。跑了不多路，看見有幾個粗布服的漢子，圍在一起，瞧前面是白茫茫的一條街，就丢了原有的興緻，也走近那幾個人的一堆裏。　　他眞想不到這兒倒着一個受傷的人，一大塊鮮紅的血塗在黝黑的馬路上，半身衣服全都浸透了血水。　　「這眞呌做寃鬼，那兩個强盜倒不知逃到什麽地方了。」一個滿嘴巴鬍子的，指手劃脚地對人家說。　　大發才完全懂得了；他再看看地上的寃鬼，是一個　年輕的人，但他又抬頭看看那幾個人，却找不出一個驚奇或同情的臉色。　　「啊呀，替死鬼，寃鬼，餓死鬼，每天是數也數不淸楚的，我們自家也不知道明天會做什麽鬼。」那個人說完就走了。「恨」與「愛」  行　　「恨」與「愛」，是生命的泉源，也即是生命的活力，沒有「恨」與「愛」，也許這宇宙便將成爲一片荒漠。　　譬如：俄國革命，他們自命爲是基於「恨」。而孫中山先生所領導的國民革命，則爲基於「愛」，所以中山先生給人題字，常是寫着「博愛」兩個大字。你能否認「愛」和「恨」的偉力嗎？　　「愛」和「恨」的對立，正猶如「笑」與「哭，」但沒有「愛，」也便沒有了「恨，」正如沒有「哭，」便不會有「笑。」「愛之力，」固然使人感到輕鬆和舒暢，如坐春風之中，但有時會鬆弛，鬆弛之後，便會感着疲勞。而「恨」呢，假如不得發洩，則將如毒蛇一樣，永遠痛囓着我們的心。譬如，高麗和印度的「亡國恨，」此恨綿綿果有盡期嗎？　　再如楊妃投繯，白居易也曾爲之高賦「長恨，」而黛玉短命，至今也還有不少的「寳玉」爲之抱恨千古，雖說這只是兒女私情，無關國家大事。　　「恨」，「愛」，生命的泉源，生命的活力，但我們的生命活力呢？我們生命的泉源呢？　　東北半壁江山被人家生生地割去了，而我們依舊是紙醉金迷的歌舞昇平，這是「恨」呢？是「愛」呢？抑是無恨無愛呢？　　無恨無愛的是盾麽？這是木石·是一團死水，我們來把死水激起一點波濤罷！募捐  王婉容女士　　我們一共八個人，被淚到學校附近的十梓街去捐募東北義勇軍的軍餉。我們早就議决好了：早上八點鐘出發，十點鐘回來上課。　　「你們主人起身了嗎？請捐助些軍餉吧！」梅說。當我們走進第一個人家的時候。　　「啊唷！又來要錢了！快出去！把老太太吵醒了，回頭又要駡我。」一個女傭人把佩一推，佩向後一退踏了我一脚，我忍着痛，跟她們退了出來！　　一輛包車從東面拖過，春放出她運動員的本色，拔腿就追，車夫跑不過她，沒有四五步，給春一把拖住了說：「請慷慨地捐助些軍餉吧！」　　「請你捐四角錢，我給你一張收據，回頭遇見别校的募捐隊，你可以不捐了。」我們也趕上去，把那輛包車圍住了，雪揚着手中的收據說。　　「什麽軍餉不軍餉？你們女學生去向女的募捐！你們懂得「男女授受不親」嗎？怎麽在街上追起男子來了？」誰也料不到一個穿西裝的胸前掛着徽章的年靑人，會說出這樣的話來。　　「眞糟糕！」　　「滑稽透了！」　　「你這亡國坯子！」大家嚷着。車夫破了重圍向前跑去了！　　走進第二家，　！好了座大宅！一個老太太督率着幾個僕人在做粉糰子。　　「請捐助些軍餉吧！」榮把手中的竹筒在旁邊桌子上一放說。她實在疲乏極了！　　「姑娘！我們這裏是向來不捐的，我們並不是蘇州人。」老太太表示拒絕說。　　「對呀！因爲你從來沒有捐過，所以今天一定要請你捐一點，不管你是不是蘇州人，總之，你也是一個中國的國民，假如沒有義勇軍在東北敵住日人，那你還吃得成粉糰麽？」我說。眞的，誰相信她呢？一口純粹的蘇州話，還想抵賴，抵賴有什麽用？　　「吃總要吃的啊！那個可以不吃呢？」老太太瞪了我一眼。　　「是的」又是我開口：「爲了義勇軍不能俄着肚子打仗，所以我們出來募捐的！」　　「啊唷！我不和你們講啦！你們女學生說話又伶俐，又好聽！我們老婆子那裏講得過你們？好了，拿幾個銅子去吧！要不要？」老婆子拿三個銅子向桌上一擲，英接過來塞在竹筒裏。　　「其實你們也是好心······」老婆子還在絮絮地說。我不覺好笑起來了，我們收了她三個銅子，不再開口，當然是「好心」了！　　走進第三家，在一座大廳上，四五個管帳先生在算租米，算盤珠打得又爽脆，又純純熟！　　啊唷！又來募捐了！對你們老實說了吧：我們不願再上當了！」一個帶眼鏡的望着我們旗上的字說。　　「拿十個銅子去吧！也好買幾個大餅吃。銀元鈔票多是多得很，不過······」一個矮胖子說話最刻毒！不知他那裏見過學生把募捐得來的錢買大餅吃過？但是誰也沒有和他分辯，和一個沒智識的人分辯，是最傻不過的事，我們終於接了錢退出來！　　走了一百幾十家人家，看夠了許多難看的面孔，聽夠了許多難聽的言詞，我們所募集的銅子還沒有把我們的竹筒塡滿三分之一。　　「咳，中國人怎麽一這樣自私呢？」梅搖着頭，嘆息說。　　「咳·····」佩也隨着搖頭抽一口冷氣。貓  幽嗚　　莫泊桑說：「凡是詩人都是愛貓的，」我覺得這句話很有道理；因依着貓類的溫和的性情，活潑的體態，笑似的臉，精細柔軟的毛，敏捷的攀登力，眞是無一不可愛的！喜歡玩貓的朋友們，一看到這一副形態，總要口不由主地喊出：「這活潑的小東西，小傢伙，丨靈敏的小寳貝」。何况是善感的詩人呢！　　我也是愛貓的一個，但是沒有詩人的才能，不能發揮我對於貓類的好感，實是一件憾事。古人說：「貓是七世小娘（妓女）投胎來的。」這大槪是指牠們的輕狂和嬌媚而言罷。　　我曾經養過好幾只貓，但是養到半途，不是死亡，定是失蹝，所以牠們留給我的懷记是狠深刻的。　　我記得十六歲那年養過一只貓，那只貓留給我的懷念最深，丨那時我眞愛那只貓啊！以後牠雖然失了蹝，但是至今尙記憶着：　　那只貓是從舅母家裏要了來的，當時牠從娘肚子裏出來，還只有兩個月的光景，但上牠已像小老虎似的東跑丁竄了。我喜歡牠的小巧活潑，所以向舅母要了來，牠在一窼中，要算頂活潑頂可愛的一只了。　　那只小貓的顏色，很是美麗，是黃白黑三色相混的，活像一只活潑可愛的小老虎，更加牠的「虎形。」丨不過沒有像老虎樣的那麽大和兇猛。　　牠充滿的是「生之力，」那圓大的眼瞳，精細柔軟的毛，溫和的性情，活潑的體態，丨像一個快樂的姑娘，充滿着明媚和淸麗。丨眞是貓中的典型！尙有那短圓的身軀，生長着精細柔軟的乳毛，滾圓可愛的小腦袋，最着二瓣石膏像似的小耳朶，那圓尖的下巴，玲瓏的小嘴，眞是可愛喲！呀！丨尙有那紅色的小鼻子，微微地帶着潤濕，耀着水凌凌的光。　　那幼貓是有着特有的天眞，一天到晚，總是蹤蹤跳跳的，一刻不停止的跳躍，跳躍時，那靈便的小身體，顯得非常活潑，有趣。　　有一天，我課後回家，吃完了午飯，在廊下曝太陽，我無意中看見那只小花貓，「神淸氣爽」地坐在門懢上，牠「馬步」擺得非常之好，安穩地，端正地，坐着。那種偉大的氣魄，像一位統領百萬雄兵的英雄，又像在深山中稱霸的大蟲！　　那時我幾乎跳起來！　　我興奮極了，一種欲望，在我的體内漸漸地升起，沿着我的神經升起，在我的四肢裏奔走，使我牙齒咬案起來，我的雙手有難熬的麻癢，我連忙握緊了我的拳頭。　　那活潑的小東西丨小傢伙，在那裏蔑視一切地坐着，有時轉動牠那活潑機警的小腦袋，似乎在搜尋什麽似的，有時用牠那柔軟的前肢，丨利爪已收縮起來了的前肢，丨毫不關心似的拭着牠那圓尖的面。　　我觀察了好一刻，想等待牠试好了面以後，然後去抓牠到懷裏來。但是牠盡管這麽着，還是從容地试牠的丨淡紅色的小鼻子。　　我等待得惱了，索性大踏步的走過去、把那小傢伙恨恨地棒將過來，牠的顫動的肢體，和精細柔軟的毛，在我的手裏滑動，我感覺到有一種神秘的熱力。這熱力將我的覺得太可愛了的而致握得緊緊的手放鬆了。我極温柔地擁抱牠，很親愛地撫摸牠，梳理牠的毛。　　牠很快活，喃喃地吐露着微音，在我的懷中滾動，那已收縮着利爪的可愛的前肢，在空中亂舞，像小手般地要折什麽東西似的。我將牠翻過來，而陽光刺激了牠的眼皮，使牠感覺到非常的不安，牠瞇緊着眼皮，「妙！妙！」地怒呌。　　我知道牠惱了，仍把牠翻轉來，放在地上。牠跳了下去覺得很自由地，伸了伸腰，立定後，將身子甩了幾甩，很活潑的「秃！······秃！」地跑走了。　　隔了幾天，我無意中走到吃飯間裡，見牠弓起着背脊，竪起着尾巴，貼在檣角的一隅，我好奇心動，走近去觀察，原來是阿王（狗名）				在飯桌下拾骨殼吃。我爲牠安全起見，把牠捧在懷裏，牠的四肢，尙在索索的抖，此時牠在我的懷抱中、很安適地嬌媚地躺着，兩隻碧綠的眼睛，烏溜溜地向我看。　　我將阿王趕走，然後放牠下來，我拿了一根繩，抽來拖去的逗着牠玩，牠舉着像小手的可愛的前肢，撲來撲去地追。　　阿王以爲我們去了，垂着頭默默地又來了，我又把牠趕走，我去逐牠時，牠倒嚇了一跳。我覺得牠太粗暴，太野蠻丨像水滸傳中五台山裡的花和尙的傢伙丨因牠屢次將雞食料竊吃去，所以我很恨牠。　　阿王雖給我趕跑了，但是跑了一些路，忽的又掉轉身子，向我們惡狠狠地不懷好意的看，妒嫉似的看，牠雙耳直竪着，一雙眼睛圓溜溜的放出狼一般的綠光來，牠以爲這小東西丨小傢伙，你們爲怎麽將牠保護的好好地。這小東西丨怪會淘氣的壞坯子，在小主人的面前，那樣快活的跑跳，活潑的攀登，似笑的臉，向小主人撒嬌，又在懔中掙扎。這種輕狂的舉動，在牠的眼中，自然看不入眼，只得「嗆」了一聲，低着頭，「　然若喪」地跑到别處去了。　　有一天下午，我課後回家，忽然感到寂莫，想找小貓玩，但是四處都找遍，總是尋不見那可愛的小貓的踪跡；那時我心裡感着一縷莫名的悲哀，可憐這幾月來相伴的小東西失了踪嗎？還是因爲人家看見牠可愛把牠捉去了呢！那時我眞感得非常的惆悵。　　一天一天的過去，我課後閒暇的時候，總是若有所失，忽忽不樂。　　過了一嚮，才聽見一個鄰人說：「你家的小貓，某日下午給一個陌生的路人帶走了。」那時我才得到確報。　　我養過好幾只貓，牠們留給我的，感想，要算牠最深了，所以我對於貓類，總是懷着好感的。　　貓，確是一只可愛的小動物丨一匹忠實的家畜啊。長篇創作時代与愛的歧路十一  張資平　　在敎室裏就是這樣的，一點秩序沒有，異常的噪雜。第一堂是無機化學，敎透指定了荷勒曼的無機化學做參考書。但是同級之中買這郁書的人實屬寥寥。海泉雖然買了一本，也是擱着沒有幾次翻開來念，因爲那本書實在是很費力，不容易讀。一般都是把先生的講義摘要抄了下來。應奎也買了一本敎科書，一樣的擱在箱裏。很奇怪的就是他在敎室裏，只是坐着聽，不抄一點筆記。　　『你怎麽不抄筆記？』　　『管它！』　　『考試時怎麽樣？』　　『管它！』　　應奎對於理科像早失望了。但又不改科。同學都不知道他是爲什麽道理。　　㈥　　海泉今天雖然一天在課堂裏，但大部分的心思並不在功課，而只是運爲到鶴子夫人那方面去。　　『日本女性竟那樣的溫柔，那樣的親切。』　　三點嚮了，大家散學了。海泉一個人留在敎室裏剛把自已怕書包結好，想走了，忽然看見唐耀星忽忽忙忙地走到他的桌位邊來。　　『你就要回去了？不忙吧。』　　耀星這樣問他。　　『有什麽事麽？開同級會？』　　因爲唐耀星是他們級裏的幹事，所以海泉這樣地問他。　　『不，我們幾個朋友想組織一個純文藝的團體，每月打算出一本雜誌。他』們要我多拉一二位朋友。但我相知的朋友有限，只好來拉你。』　　『我是不懂文藝的。要我加進去有甚意思？』　　『不要緊。你來看看吧。願意時，就加進來。』　　『誰主持的？』　　『我們的一位同鄕，很誠懇的人，新從法國回來的文學家。他是頗有名望　　的人。』　　『呌什麽名字？』　　『你猜猜看。』　　『陳華民，是不是？』　　『···················』　　唐耀星點了點首。</p>

<p>業餘週刋（恒志）第二期業餘漫譚覺悟的暗示改造的曙光  樸　　自上期的業餘的創刋號與店員通迅欄和讀者諸君見面以來，最使記者感奮者則爲二百封以上討論問題的函件與描寫工人，學徒們的種種悲慘，非人生活的文稿。在店員方面，雖說在地位上要比工人學徒們高一點，但在實際上所感受着的經濟壓迫與智識饑荒的痛苦，並沒有多大的分别。我們分析接到的來信與投稿的内容，差不多有百分之九十以上是關於經濟困難，和極端勞苦的叙述，以及如何利用業餘繼續增進學識的一類問題。當此内亂未止外交最急迫的時候，記者聽了這許多眞誠的，悲憤的，如地獄生活的種種怨恨慘呼，就不禁悲痛萬分，我們看這歐化的上海，在一方是如此的富麗堂皇·在另一面則如彼的陰沉慘酷，國家前途，實已到了不堪設想的地步，但是一轉念間，想到這種慘呼的裏面，確又包含着無限的覺悟的暗示和一綫的改造曙光，倘若我們能具體化這種覺悟的能力，光大這一綫的改造曙光，也未嘗不是救民族救自已的一個内手門徑，於是又不知不覺的興奮起來。　　但是如何可以達到這具體化與光大的方法，則又是一個屬於無師可承的創造問題，生長在這一盤散沙式的社會中的我們，當然是毫無經騐可言，因此我們現在惟有用一面研究一面試騐的態度，去一步一步的探討。我們祇要堅决的相信，小環境的改造，是少數人造成的，大環境的改造，是大多數人造成的，我們相信愈研究愈試騐的結果，自能增加具體化的形成，光大改造的可能性。說到這裏我不妨拿記者方接到一位洪君一封信内的建議，來做這一篇漫譚的結束，同時也可以給大家研究的一個啓示。　　洪君的信内大意是說，大多數學徒們所受的環境的壓迫，是大多數相同的，大多數是過着終日悶悶不樂的生活，所以洪君建議，凡是讀本刋的學徒們，應當藉着這個機會，由本刋居中做個介紹人，然後由各個人互相通訊，互述彼此改良生活環境的意見，倘若因此使性情相近的能漸漸熟悉起來，再進一步成爲一個知已的朋友，將來在生活改進與學議修養的方面，豈不是大有裨益麽？記者深覺洪君這個建議極有研究的價値，特在此提出來，作爲大家覺悟和改造的參考。至於該函的原文，當另在他日店員通訊欄内公布，歡迎讀者褚君表示意見。問題討論業餘娛樂改進問題業餘娛樂與打麻雀  也萍　　誰都可以相信，差不多大半的業餘者，統在打麻雀上去耗費他們可寳貴的業餘有限娛樂時間的。因爲有這麽個普遍的事實，尤其是在上海或其他較大的城市裏，打麻雀是件公開的賭博行爲，所以有値得我們討論和研究的價値。　　我們討論的出發點是：業餘娛樂是絕對必需的。因爲一個人每天經過了八小時以上的辦公室生活以後，精神上已是感到極度的困疲或沉悶，雖然睡眠能使精神復原，可是，每天如只有睡眠和工作二種單調循環的生活方式的話，那也是絕對不行，那簡直會把你的壽命幾何級數般的縮短。這對於生活上是不可不注意的。　　其次，我們要討論到打麻雀是不是適宜於業餘娛樂？我可以肯定地說一句，打麻雀絕對不適宜於業餘娛樂，除了害處之外，在它上面你决找不出什麽好處來的。久而久之，你玩慣了以後，第一，在物質上你必然的要受到損失。總計起來，打麻雀的人，是沒有一個能贏錢的，不然，頭錢就沒着落。的麻雀的四個人跟頭家，好比是五隻缸，中間一隻空的，好比是頭家，周圍四隻是盛着水的，好比是四個打麻雀的人，於是打麻雀的每局輸贏之關係的過程，就好比把有水的四隻缸中的水勺過來，勺過去，而每勺一次，必滳進空缸内一些，就是所謂打頭。這樣繼續好久之後，它的結果便是：本來盛着水的四隻缸，其水殆盡，而本來沒有水的那隻空缸，即坐收其利的那隻空缸，却適得其反，得着滿盈盈的一缸水。故坐着打麻雀的四個人，逐日統計起來，是沒有一個不輸錢的，不過各人所輸的程度有些不同吧了。在目前的社會狀况之下，錢是生活的要素，錢旣然輸了，一定地又會關連到精神上的痛苦。可是還有更糟的呢。不打麻雀則已，旣然打起麻雀來了，就打了四圈丨丨起碼四圈，再來四圈，又來四圈，······，非到大家都精疲力盡了不能再坐下去的時候，是不肯收塲的。這是通常的毛病。所以一動手就往往要到晚上二三點鐘才能睡覺，或甚至酣戰達旦！這樣，不管你身體怎樣的强健，結果，漸漸地，最初，你的身體覺得有些不舒服，頭痛啦，腰背酸疼啦，······，到後來，必然地，神經衰弱啦，失眠啦，及其他類似的疾病會爬到你軀體上來。朋友，試問娛樂之本意何在？　　上面不過是它的最顯着的兩種害處，此外如一個好打麻雀的人，他對於衛生上一定是講究不到的。打完牌，擦了一把臉，馬上就上辦公室去，這是常有的事。甚至第二天辦公完了以後，再來幹它所謂頭一天興緻尙未完的工作。這對於身體只有害無益，是可以斷言的。　　總之，我十分誠懇地希望玩麻雀的朋友們，能夠從這深坑裏邊跳出來，而走上其他正當的途徑。小職員生活問題强迫的交易  會爭　　「送禮」，在公司裏做小職員的我們，常常被這兩個字苦惱着。　　當每月庶務處送來薪水之後，常常的發現總要少了幾元錢，有時竟會去掉三分之一，原因是；庶務處代你送過幾分禮，而把錢扣去了。　　高級職員的收入，比我們高得多，扣掉他們幾元錢，當然也算不了一回事　　（尙有重要文字，轉入第二版）</p>

<p>。可是，在我們這班三四十元錢的小職員階級，就有些苦惱了。本來，除掉生活必需的费用之外，就一文不會餘剩的，這樣一來，就非負債不行了。所以，我們對於「送禮」，都是同聲的嘆氣着。　　本來「送禮」這回事，是基於人類之間的感情，某甲有了一件値得紀念或歡喜的事，如結果生子之類，與某甲感情好的人，就送他一份禮去，一方面加緊他的歡喜，一方面給他留個紀念。再如，某甲遇到一件悲傷不幸的事，如父母喪亡之類，也就送一份禮去，安慰他的心靈，但在現代，尤其在上海，是變成了一種「强迫的交易」。有感情的朋友且不去說他，就是在幾千人中與我毫不相干的一位同事，也得去送一份禮，有時，這受禮的主人，我尙不知道他尊貎如何。　　你有事的時候，我要送一份禮，且得要吃一頓。我有事的時候，你也要送禮，也得來吃一餐。在形式上說起來是「送禮」，在它實質上說起來就是「强迫的交易。」（藉事歛錢者，又當别論）再就社會的全體說起來，這是一種無限大的浪費！　　國難日深，國貧日甚，我們且慢點說什麽「節衣縮食」，以救國家，這社會上無限大的浪費丨送禮，我们何不先把牠剷除？少一分的浪費，固然是救了我們自已的一分貧窮，也就是節省了國家的一分財富。　　剷除「送禮」的習慣，同時也不收人的禮，組織一個不送禮者同盟。我想這正是我們工商界業餘的社會運動之種啊！工商界生活學徒生活當學徒的不許求知  阿羊　　舊商店的學徒生活，在我讀書的時候，早已聽慣了一半，從掃地抺桌子，凈烟袋起，一直做到給店夥役使爲止，笨重的，瑣屑的，沒有不參與的。這三年的期限丨商店學徒例須三年滿師丨不但是賣絕了勞働，並且整個自由，都被剝削了呢丨所以當我初久商店做學徒的時候，早已震慄得想避免這種嘗試。可是環境的使然，與夫老人家的勉勵：「吃得苦中苦，主爲人上人」及「大事業都從小處做起」。是以結果仍逃不了這種和嘗試。　　學徒生活開始了，不錯，這種生活同我以前聽到的一些不錯，掃地，抺桌子，凈烟袋，服侍大先生，這是日常不易的生活，此外就是「跑腿」，二隻腿總是在忙忙的勞働中。　　本來，生活只要慣常，所謂「習慣成自然」便是。這些生活做久了，自也不覺得勞忙，倒反處之泰然，並且熟能生巧，時間的分配，也就綽乎有餘。爲省時間有餘裕，又不得不使我發生求知的慾望，除了想在書本上自修一點學識外，還想學一些商業上的知識，但是，結果，眞出意料之外丨上進的思想，在舊商店中的學徒，可以不必具有的，眞的，做一個學徒除了只配給人役使之外，什麽都完了丨這實是學徒生活回憶中最使我痛心的一頁丨　　譬如我沒有瞭解某一種的商業上習慣，向一位「大先生」詢問的時候，所得到的解答，總是這樣的；『唔，你是不懂的，這些事情你還管不到，慢慢兒你總會知道的，現在，只管你地方收拾淸潔些就夠了。』喲！這是多麽不近情理的事！原爲着不知道才詢問，學生意原是來「學」的，現在不許你「學」，只支配着一些勞働下層工作，事情是何等的矛盾！「學徒不配談正經事的！」我總得作如是解。　　旣然學徒不配談正經事了，在這業餘之暇，以是又想到讀些書來補救知識的缺陷，喲！我的天，這爿商店的所謂「大先生」眞不知是什麽存心！一天，爲着見了我拿着書本在看，就這麽說：『空了只管看書，不曉得好好地立在櫃台邊，要是都像你拿了書看看，又呌那個來做生意？』這眞使我幾乎哭出來，我想想無事時只許你呆呆木立在櫃台旁，不由你來求一些知識，這又是什麽意思？但是，舊商店裏的階級是多麽顯明，小犯上，這是了不得的事，雖然當時我可以用充足的理由回駁他，可是，我是學徒啊，只有隱忍下去。從此我就不敢公然利用餘暇來看書，不過求知的慾念，終抑制不下，最後是用了種種避免的方法偷偷地看書。『學徒上不許讀書的！』我又如是的解答自已。　　我還記得，不知在那一天，我因要求在晚間加入夜校讀外國語的事，竟遭了一交大訓斥，險些兒連生意都脫籍！嚴厲的話像是這樣的：『你要讀夜書可以的，你就回你老家去好好的讀，可是在這裏學生意是不許去讀的。』我只會暗暗吊下了幾滴眼淚。販桃子（註）　  何文鑫　　（註）販桃子就是偷跑的意思，這是我們家鄕的土語，且流行得很廣。　　平日門面淸冷，沒有生意的興隆布店，今天突然熱閙擁擠起來，密密的人頭將一爿小小的布店塞滿了。　　『阿福小鬼頭販桃子了！』從裏面擠出一個人來，用才勢對着站在街心的一位老者說。　　『啊！就是那個十歲不到的小鬼頭，也學會了販桃子嗎？眞是個沒出息的東西！』　　於是老者分開兩旁的觀衆，一直走進櫃檯裏面，向坐在賬桌傍的一位黑矮胖子拱拱手。　　『芝翁！一向可好？』　　『哦！延老！承問！承問！請坐！請坐！』　　『今天我打這兒經過，看見寳號裏擠滿了人，我不敢造次進來；後來請一位朋友探聽是怎麽一回事，原來是阿福販桃子了。呵！呵！一個十歲不到的人！』　　『延老！現在的世界壞透了！這樣的小鬼頭什麽事都不能做，「偷錢」「販桃子」却幹得出』　　『啊！還會偷錢嗎？』　　『可不是！昨天我看見他用一支新鉛筆在桌上畫，我問他：「這支鉛筆從什麽地方來的？」他說：「買的。」我說：「那末，你錢又從什麽地方來的呢？」他却說是他母親給他的丨這一來我的氣可就大哪！好小子！前天賬上明明少了兩角錢，不是他還有誰偷的？古語說得好，「從小偷釘，長大偷金」我就順手打他幾下。』　　『這是敎訓子姪的道理，應當！應當！』　　『可是，他就販桃子了！』　　『唉！不可救藥！』　　觀衆似乎已經明白阿福販桃子的原委，再沒有站下去的必要了，於是漸漸地散去；興隆布店仍然回復了牠冷淸淸的門面。業餘咖啡𢉰業餘和無綫電  學范　　「業餘」兩字在無綫電界中，是一個極有歴史，有意義的名詞。業餘無綫電家對於無綫電方面的供獻，可稱首屈一指！　　我們知道無綫電的發明到現在，還不足五十年的歷史，而發明的時候，所謂無綫電者，還只是科學方面的一種試騐，射電的距離是極近極近，只能在試騐室裡通通電報而已。直到一九○七年意大利有位馬可尼（Ｍarconi），他在一座小山試騐，居然成功了比較遠距離的通報了。及後更經其他專家的改良，方始效用漸著。計自馬可尼發明時起，至今還不足三十年，而現在無綫電一日千里的形勢，其發展速率已超過世界上任何發明之上，這是多麽的可驚歎啊！　　在六七年前，世界上所有的無綫電，都是長波。什麽呌長波呢？這也得講一講。據說：無綫電的發射，乃是由於從天綫上有一種電波發出，這電波可以隨意長短，在發報機上有一種足以調整的東西。不過這發出來的電波，非人目所能見，是科學家一種試騐的發見。凡電波在二百米突以上的，都名長波。從前用長波的時候，無綫電的效用，還不怎樣大，因爲長波有幾種缺點；射電的距離還不怎樣遠，且收聽起來，易受種種干擾。直到一九二五年，美國有位業餘無綫電者丨所謂業餘無綫電者就是他有其他職業，而以玩無綫電爲消遣的丨忽然有件驚人的發明。他試騐的結果，是無綫電的波長，不必一定要在二百米突以上，如果在二百米突以下，則發射的距離要遠得多，而且節省電力，機器也可減少不少。自這位業餘無綫電家的發現之後，一般無綫電的專家，於是都研究短波起來了，所得結果，覺得確然比長波高明得多！從此無綫電的形勢，發生一個大變動，大家棄長波而用短波了。我們所該驚佃的：是科學家一年到頭，在試騐室中研究無綫電，而沒有夢想到短波有這樣的成就，最後竟被一位在工作之餘，以玩玩無綫電爲消遣的業餘無綫電者，發明了一件驚天動地的大成功，這不要說我們該表欽佩，就是大科學家也要自愧勿如，表示欽佩的了！那末，所謂短波的射電距離，究竟怎樣遠呢？這是很容易證明的。現在上海的國際無綫電台，每天能和美國直接通報，工作爽利，毫無困難。至於無綫電的速度丨這事請讀者不要認我是在講童話丨也要比所讀神行太保日行八百里，和孫行者一個觔斗十萬八千里，還遠，遠。據科學家的試騐說：一秒鐘可繞地球七週，眞太快了。　　業餘無綫電者在中國也有。就播音台而言，如上海的各小播音台。他們大都毫無商業作用，有的目的在研究，有的目的在玩玩，所以統稱爲業餘播音電台。還有一種業餘電台，他們不能播音，專用爲打電報的，但這並不是搶什麽交通部的生意去打商報，乃是他們業餘無綫電家個人用以和各處同性質的電台通着玩的。像這樣的業餘電台，各國都有，已遍佈了全世界了。業餘電台的波長，有規定，是一律的，所以業餘電台相互之間，常常能夠通報碰頭，無論認識的，不認識的，或是外國的，本國的，旣然彼此都是同志，則頗能互相帮助。此如我的業餘電台叙然和法國某地的業餘電台接觸了，按照普通規則，他理應立刻寫一封信吿訴我，他那方面聽我的成績是如何，這　麽的能表示合作啊？文藝失業  英會　　金生總覺得這幾天工頭對待他不大好，像專給他過不去似的。一個車間裏，旁的小工，工頭連看都不看，惟有對他，比巡警注意一個小偷那情景還厲害。兩隻賊溜溜眼睛，死釘釘的瞧着他。他能使那一對討厭的眼睛離開麽？不能，他沒有那種力量。他只有把自已的工作做好些來援助自已這一條方法丨橫豎沒有做錯事，你工頭想說話也無從張嘴。金生從來做工不偷懶，這一項，非但他自已可以引以爲榮，就是同車間的工友，連女工和把車子的都算在内，沒一個不知道他。他才只有十八歲，身體雖然長得像個大人，但面色，顯然是因爲後天的營養不足，滿現着枯黃的顏色。他來這××紗廠，還不到兩個月，做一天四角錢的小工。是一個同鄕領他進廠的。初時像有些不熟悉，過些天，就一點也不感到生疏了，工作使他做的很順手。只是，工頭的臉子難看極了，他從沒有對他笑過一笑，而且每次對他說話時，照例像主子責僕人那樣的兇惡：　　『還沒掃乾凈，你瞎了？』　　『想甚麽鬼事情？自已事做完了？做完了要再找事情做才行！』　　『剛剛來你就學偷懶，你不想吃這口飯啦？』　　這是工頭向他講的一類話，他是人，有血性，自然生氣，可是，想一想，還是不能同他分辯。忍着罷，你一出聲，他一句話，生活就給你停了。爲了生活，挨打挨駡也不能不忍耐呀！但他到底不明白，爲什麽工頭對他偏不好？他實在想不出這道理。　　這一天早上，金生提了飯盒，又到廠裏去做工。在路上冷風吹的直打冷戰，但一到車間裏就暖了。冷與暖，自然地管不得這些事，他只有給人家賣力氣一件事。正午汽笛一響，一個跟一個工人往車間外面走，他也擠在人堆裏。樓上，樓下，院子裏到處是人，怪好看的。有些住在附近的工人回到家裏去吃午飯，離家遠的工人，部把帶來的飯盒子打開來吃，用廠裏燒的臭自來水開水來泡飯。吃飯的時間實在短，僅僅只有二十分鐘。這在每天，他也還是夠用，可是今天就不同了，吃了飯，不知是冷氣鑽到肚子裏去，還是吃了蒼蠅，肚子裏眞難過，又想瀉，又想吐。他跑到厠所裏去。這眞是想不到的事，他剛剛瀉完，接着又吐起來，同時，上工汽笛最後一遍呌過了，車間裏已經開始工作起來。他急忙往樓上跑，不巧又嘔，於是他又回到厠所去吐。這樣一來，當他到車間裏動手作工時，已經遲了七分鐘。工頭正好等在他作工的左近地方，神氣十足的向他說：　　『你幹嗎去來的，這樣晚？』　　『我······我吃飯······吃錯了······吐······瀉······』他口吃着答，一邊做着工作。　　『我呌你吃錯飯？吃錯飯就有理麽？』　　『下回不這樣了。』　　『我管你這樣不這樣，分明是揩油！罰你兩只洋！』　　『眞是吐瀉，你不信看看·········』　　『不要多說話！幾天我就看你要揩油。』　　『我眞沒有·········』　　『再說！』工頭截住金生的話。『再說就罰你四只洋！』　　可憐的金生沒在辦法，處在工頭的淫威之下，只好不說話了。但那兩只洋哪，要五天才能做到手，除了罰金，到月底，只有十只洋了。金生想到這裏，恨工頭比恨東洋人還兇，恨不一下子把他打死，管他以後什麽吃官司，坐獄，賠命一些狗事，可是。他還是不能，不能，除了自已氣憤，哀嘆之外，别沒有好的辦法。因爲你再多說一句，工頭他會開除你，那你就沒得生洛做了，又要餓肚子。沒有開除，他就還是要給人家做呀，他仍然繼續着工作，雖然心裏面十二萬分難過，可是。眞有點見鬼，也許是「禍不單行」罷，一齣過去了，又來了一齣。一個小姊妹的鞋，不知怎的滑到輪子旁邊去，眼看就要捲進去了，旁的人都忙着做自已的工作，沒人看見，就是他，天，爲什麽偏讓他看見！他爲一種人的本能所驅使，忘記了一切，上前去就把那隻鞋子搶回來。他交給了那個小姊妹。她正在急得沒辦法，看到這意外的收復，歡樂的向他道了謝：『謝謝你。』　　『不要丨』還未等他說那「客氣」兩個字，工頭又走到他的面前了。　　『這回還說什麽，是不是揩油：』　　『我·········我·········』　　『你甚麽？你！』　　『他給我拿了這隻鞋子。』小姊妹來替他分辯，一面把鞋子捲到輪子旁的事情對工頭說了。　　『不管！那個要你不當心！拾鞋來，做工來？吊膀子？揩油！』　　小姊妹臉上紅紅的，但不敢反抗。　　『你再說，罰你一只洋！』　　小姊妹沒辦法，一句話也不敢說。這時候金生又動手做起工，但工頭却嚇阻他：『放下手！不要你再做！要我天天來專看你揩油？我沒這多工夫！去罷，回你老家去罷。』　　金生待要分辯，工頭把他推出門去了。因此，他失了業。　　這一切，到底爲甚麽，工頭爲什麽偏欺負他，他是沒有弄淸楚，一直到夫業以後一個月，才聽到老工人說到了，他說新工人進廠做工，頭一個月工錢要分給工頭一半的。金生不知道這事情，縱知道，他也絕對不會幹，所以他失業。他失業，只是這一點點道理！自我職業介紹跌入萬丈的深坑  璞如女士　　在福建的南部，有一個風　　　四　　（尙有重要文字，轉入第三　）</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>山　　的小城，那便是我的故鄕。當我在十二歲　年的秋天，因爲父親要到省城去做事，所以我就不得不跟着他偕同母親和弟弟移居那邊了。　　這也可以說是我的幸運；省城的風氣，較之故鄕要開通得多，女子讀書是極普遍的事情。這個大好的機會，我那肯讓牠錯過哩？於是，我由小學畢業，就考入第一女子師範了。　　五年的師範生生活過得眞决呀，到行畢業典禮那一天，我還像在夢中一樣，以爲這就畢業了嗎？可是，眞畢業了！　　從此以後，悲哀之神，便時常降臨到我的頭上。因爲環境的關係，使我不能升學，這是我終身的憾事，丨我記罣着，悲哽着。母親似乎知道我的心意，時時安慰我，但我呢，總是悶悶的坐在家中。　　第二年春天，得着親戚的介紹到上海某印書館担任編製索引，這工作雖是機械的，却是極有趣味；而同時生活問題，也得以解决。在我，於勞瘁之餘，總算獲得一點小小的滿足。　　眞是最大的不幸，出乎意料之外的滬戰，突然爆發了！偏偏我所服務的某印書館，損失極大，不得不暫時關門，於是我重行跌入萬丈悲哀的深坑，成爲一個失業者。　　當這個百業凋敞，到處人浮於事的時候，渺小的我，有什麽方法能夠找到職業哩？這不能不深深的抱着疑懼。　　我的能力固然有限，但就文書校對圖書編目及索引等等工作而言，自信尙能勝任；而且對於報酬，也沒有什麽奢望，每月能有三四十元已足夠了。店員通訊如何抗日救國？  黃明遠　　周良驥君於業餘創刊號店員通訊欄曾提出五個問題，前四個已由編輯先生答覆，後一個，卽「站在店員與學徒的地位，如何盡中華民國一份子的義務幹抗日救國的工作。一編輯先生認爲這問題須依各種客觀的條件而定，將問題提出給大家討論，作者對於編輯先生的這種態度，頗表同情。茲將鄙見所及，提出與熱心抗日救國的工商界同胞一加商榷；非敢云答覆周君，不過聊供問題討論之一參考耳。　　在目前，我們可以說：「抗日即所以救國」然而如何抗日呢？這裏仍舊不外是積極的武力抵抗和消極的經濟絕交兩個辦法。武力抵抗在我國目前現有的國防和軍隊組織的條件之下，是不可能的事。惟一可能的辦法是經濟絕交。我們不應忽視了經濟絕交的辦法。所謂經濟絕交，有兩重意義：第一，它表示一種不合作而反抗的態度；第二，在日本國民經濟組織的特殊情形之下，有效的經濟絕交可以致日本的死命。然則，如何做到有效的經濟絕交呢？這問題對於一般店員，工友和學徒有嚴重的意義。我們不要因以往的經濟絕交失敗而灰心，更不要因在抵制日貨的口號下日貨反而暢銷反而充斥的現象而喪氣，我們應該而且必須覺悟，抵制日貨的失敗，决不是方法的本身有什麽錯誤，而是力法的執行者之無組織。所謂方法執行者主要的是一般店員工友和學徒。這方僅因爲他們是國民一份子，而且因爲他們是經濟絕交的直接關係人。站在店員，工友和學徒的立塲，要想做到有效的經濟絕交；第一，應接着街道和行業組織起來；第二，有組織的不買日貨；第三，用組織的力量積極地禁止各人的店東收買日貨，消極的焚毁各店東所有的一切日貨；第四，在必要的條件下，須以各種的恐嚇手段對待奸商，務使日貨絕跡於市場。這裏所謂恐嚇手段，是有組織的而不是個人的。　　店員，工友和學徒，如能堅决地按照上述的辦法做去，對於經濟絕交必有巨大的幇助，而且也只有這樣做去綫盡了國民一份子的義務。不過在這樣有效的經濟絕交辦法下，日本因受不起這樣的打擊，必然地要以武力進攻中國，那時便不是經濟絕交所能爲力，惟有用我們的肉和血與日本拚個最後的勝負。所以店員，工友和學徒，在目前應以最大的毅力組織起來，做到有效的經濟絕交，并在經濟絕交的現階段，作增進智識和體力的準備，以應國家將來的需要。編餘　　你們看，讀者諸君！本刋倒底沒有失約，今天又與諸君見面了！雖則幼稚的本刋不過是脫母胎剛及一週的一個嬰孩，還沒有到使諸君刮目相待的時期，可是，今曉晨曦却透漏了消息，說這個嬰孩又要和前星期日一樣，當很多人尚滯留牀第，好夢未回之時，他的六十歲老母親却早已抱着他束裝就道。人們都在懷念着他們。他們很急忙地徧訪親友，幾乎是不脛而走了。　　（寃枉帳審不淸）這一週内嘆苦的文章我們收到的更多，其中一大半是學徒和店員投的稿；在五十餘篇覺徒的來稿中，只有兩篇對於目前生活是表示滿足的。甚至某公司的營業主任也來訴寃。有的還把自已的性别，年齡，藉貫，出身，履歷等等都一一開列了，這簡直是在做狀紙，而本刋也就彷彿是個特殊的民衆法庭了。有一位投稿者說行好：『貴刋很能給一般小資產階級者發洩悲怨的機會。』不過階級的限制却是沒有的，對於描寫無產階級或資產階級生活的文字，我們也一樣的歡迎。好在我們畢竟不是法官，也不必顧慮到被吿屢傳不到一類的事，站在我們身傍儼然如同書記官的那隻字紙簏，也户遠會拿不到我們手裏的稿件。我們只是盡量的發表投稿諸君心血的結晶，讓司法者去大談他們偉大的法律罷！　　（救救孩子）　比從礦山中掘得黃金還快樂的，是我們從黑暗的人間地獄裏，從地的下層，發現了一位具有天才的無名作家。這位先生寄給我們一篇傑作，又附有一信說：『······我做過工，還做過報販子。······我是可以多寫些這類文藝的。我的生活異常困苦，失業好幾個月，故鄕又正是在東北，欲歸不得。如先生每月爲刋登一兩篇短文，我的吃飯問題差不多可以解决了，省得再向朋友揩油。我每一月飯費有七塊錢就夠了，房錢還只六塊錢，這以外我再不化什麽錢。······』現在他的來稿已在這一期中發表了。我們希望他以後能源源惠稿。不論甘露也好，或是苦杯之水也好，想來他，豐富的生活的泉源裏一定是充滿着這些的。　　（××學××齋女生好舞）　最近有一位先生寄給我們一則小新聞，大意是說，××學女生常在臥室中，三三倆倆，學習跳舞，以卜男友的歡心。這位投稿者是一位中學敎員，是負有敎育責任的，我們當然歡迎他投稿，可惜他這篇東西似未免太迎合一般人的低級趣味了。本刋是以補助工商業敎育，改進業餘生活爲宗旨的，因此，我們切盼這位先生和其他的投稿諸君以後能給我們多賜寄一些合於本刋性質的文字。（編者）</p>

<p>(Beiping) At 1:00 PM today, He Zhuguo met with Wakakawa. The Japanese agreed to withdraw the armored vehicles. At 4:00 PM, one armored vehicle left Yudong and the other remained outside Yuguan. Japanese troops withdrew to their original positions, and the situation slightly eased. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops Dig Trenches Outside Yuguan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese troops outside Yuguan, on the 9th at noon, were digging trenches in the area of ​​Nandaotai's tomb, more than ten miles southeast of the city. He Zhuguo, Brigade Commander of our 9th Brigade, transferred the 665th Regiment from the county to reinforce the defense and deployed work at Erlidian. After 7:00 PM, two to three thousand Japanese troops entered the Nandaotai tomb position and provoked us by opening fire. He ordered restraint and quiet.

<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese sources, the Sino-Japanese conflict near Yuguan on December 7 was caused by Japanese armored trains firing on Chinese soldiers at the forward station. Alternatively, it is said that it was because Japanese soldiers wanted to fetch water without notifying beforehand, and Chinese soldiers opened fire to prevent them from advancing. The Japanese armored train then swept the Chinese soldiers with machine guns. According to Japanese sources, the case is still under negotiation. The opinion of foreigners here is that there will be no new developments in Shanhaiguan or Rehe. It is heard that both places are now peaceful. Chinese sources here verify the claim that the Yuguan case has been resolved. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese armored train not only fired on Chinese soldiers but also fired eight or nine times into the city, fortunately without causing any losses, but the residents were very frightened and fled to Qinhuangdao one after another. Furthermore, according to the Huayu News, the Japanese authorities claimed that the Righteous Army was hiding in the city, so they opened fire. After the case occurred, there was only a minor reaction in Beiping, but the people in Tianjin were very nervous. The authorities are now taking strict precautions to prevent accidents.

<p>(Nanjing) According to political news, the Japanese army invaded Shanhaiguan on the night of the 8th. In Rehe, preparations for an invasion have also been made in recent days. This is a planned policy of aggression by the Japanese. It was widely rumored in June and July of this year that the Japanese army would disrupt North China and invade Rehe when the League of Nations met, so that the League of Nations would be unable to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute and complete its ambition to annex the so-called "Four Northeastern Provinces." Therefore, the situation in North China and Rehe may worsen at any time. Officials are paying close attention to this. General observation is that if the Japanese army dares to risk the great disapproval of the world and invade us, we will resist to the death and not allow an inch of land to be lost.

<p>Opening of the Internal Affairs Conference</p>
<p>Second Internal Affairs Conference</p>
<p>(Photographed by Nanjing Guanghua)</p>
<p>(Chairman's Speech) Chairman Huang Shaoxiong delivered the opening speech, stating that it was admirable that representatives from remote provinces were able to attend the meeting on schedule, and he was especially grateful to the dozens of expert members who had come from afar to guide the work. Since the First Internal Affairs Conference, the Northeast has been lost, the Shanghai war has occurred, the bandit disaster in Hubei and Jiangxi, the drought disaster in Shaanxi and Gansu, the Yangtze River flood, and epidemics in various provinces. These are mostly due to poor personnel management. This is the first significance of convening the Second Internal Affairs Conference. Our country has vast lands and a large population, and the climate, customs, and habits are different. Legislators must strive for uniformity of the legal system and prevent the progress of undertakings, so as to avoid major misunderstandings. The Second Internal Affairs Conference aims to correct this defect and strive to reconcile the opinions of the Central Government and various provinces. This is the second significance of convening the Second Internal Affairs Conference, and special attention is paid to issues such as county administration, local autonomy, police administration, defense corps, land, and water conservancy. It is hoped that everyone will express great opinions and complete the mission of this conference. (Central Government Instruction) Chu Minyi, representing the Central Government, delivered an instruction, stating that our country has been devastated for the past three years, with soldiers, bandits, floods, and foreign troubles intertwined. Fortunately, the whole country has worked hard and is gradually recovering. Many of you are directly responsible, and it is inevitable that you will encounter difficulties in promoting internal affairs. However, in order to achieve the goal of revitalizing China, all kinds of difficulties must be overcome. As for what methods to use to overcome these difficulties, this is what the Central Government hopes from you and wants to obtain from this conference.</p>
<p>(National Government Instruction) Chairman Lin's instruction stated that during the period of political tutelage, internal affairs are of utmost importance. The most important aspects of internal affairs are local autonomy and then rural construction. The Premier paid great attention to both undertakings. Other matters concerning rural security and defense methods are also extremely important. This Internal Affairs Conference is the key to future political clarification, and its importance is comparable to that of the National Conference.</p>
<p>(Executive Yuan Instruction) Peng Xuepei, representing the Executive Yuan, stated in his instruction that some say that internal affairs do not need to be discussed in a conference and can simply be ordered to be carried out. This does not truly understand its advantages and disadvantages, because if one can recognize the importance of something, then one will have a good way to manage it.</p>
<p>(Speeches from Various Parties) Zhang Weihan, representing the Legislative Yuan, spoke next, followed by an instruction from the representative of the Judicial Yuan, followed by a speech by Shi Ying, the Mayor of Nanjing, who elaborated on local autonomy and primary education. Next, Wang Yongbin, a member of the Examination Committee, spoke, followed by Chen Qicai, the Director of the National Government Accounting Office. (Speech abbreviated)</p>
<p>(Response and Adjournment) Finally, Huang Shaoxiong delivered a response, respectfully thanking the Central Government and the presidents and guests of various Yuan for coming to guide them. It was already noon, and the ceremony was declared complete. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>— Sincerely</p>
<p>General Su Bingwen's forces, since raising the banner of righteousness in Manzhouli around October of this year, have coordinated with the forces of Ma Zhanshan, Zhang Dianjiu, and others to roam across Northern Manchuria, repeatedly achieving remarkable feats. This prevented the iron hooves of the Japanese army from easily stepping into Northern Manchuria, and the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun could still be flown on the peaks of the Xing'an Mountains. After several months of arduous struggle, they were ultimately forced to retreat into Soviet territory to disarm due to depleted ammunition and supplies and the enemy's ceaseless reinforcements. The telegram announcing the retreat stated: "Our army raised its banner righteously and vowed not to resort to a desperate last stand, choosing instead to die for our country. However, considering the local populace, who have suffered from famine and drowning for two months, continued resistance would only lead to mutual destruction and serve no purpose." The message is both tragic and stirring, with every word soaked in tears, yet the benevolent heart of a virtuous man shines through on the page. He further stated, "We will seek passage back to our country to continue our work, and we will contend with the enemy as long as we draw breath, never wavering in this resolve." These words are resolute and uncompromising, as if one could hear his voice and see his person. Alas, the general has retreated due to depleted ammunition and supplies. The enemy flag now flutters in the wind over Manzhouli, and another 1,500-plus li of our territory has fallen completely under the trampling hooves of the enemy cavalry. We look north with longing, unable to suppress our grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Although isolated and outnumbered, the heroic army has long resisted the strong enemy. Various righteous forces have managed to support each other from time to time, but the enemy forces increase daily while our reinforcements fail to arrive. The disparity in the quality of firearms is especially pronounced. Using a tired and weakened army to confront the enemy, which is like tigers and wolves, while facing ice, snow, hunger, and cold, defeat and retreat are inevitable. When the general started the uprising, he said in the telegram that "success or failure, gain or loss, are not considerations." It seems he was already aware that today's retreat was within the realm of possibility. We recall General Ma Zhanshan's retreat from Jiangqiao last winter, and the painful withdrawal of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army during the Shanghai Battle this spring. General Su Bingwen's retreat into Soviet territory was also dictated by circumstances. Moreover, even if General Su retreats, there are still many righteous armies in Northern Manchuria, and the enemy cavalry may not be able to run rampant at will. What we are most grieved and indignant about is that since the outbreak of the Eastern Provinces Incident, the national situation has remained chaotic as before. The righteous armies are fighting arduously, the internal conflicts within the country continue unabated, the refugees outside Guanwai (Shanhaiguan Pass) are displaced and wandering into Guannei (inside Shanhaiguan Pass), while the people inside the country are singing and dancing merrily. The whole nation is facing a great calamity but remains unconcerned, like silkworms flying into a net, unaware of the danger. General Su's retreat today, like General Ma's retreat last winter, is due to depleted ammunition and supplies. We truly do not understand what our 450 million people are doing.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the disaster in the Northeast, more than a year has passed. The situation has become increasingly dangerous, and justice has been completely swallowed by power. Now that the League of Nations Conference is reopening, only a few small countries are still willing to speak out for justice regarding the so-called Sino-Japanese issue. As for the major powers, they continue to adopt a delaying and perfunctory attitude, engaging in political maneuvering and harboring ulterior motives, silently observing the changes and unwilling to speak out for justice. Japan has brazenly declared repeatedly to the General Assembly, "Please 'wait and see.'" What does "wait and see" mean? It means that given time, they can wipe out our righteous armies and stabilize the overall situation in the Eastern Provinces. Their "wait and see" is "aggression," while our wait and see is "waiting for death." With death imminent, yet we remain unmoved, under this "wait and see," General Su's forces have already been defeated. It is foreseeable that our heroic armies in the three provinces, struggling arduously, will be successively defeated by the strong enemy under circumstances of depleted ammunition and supplies. General Su's defeat and retreat is just the beginning of a complete collapse. Are we truly going to "wait for death"? Are we truly going to sit idly by as the Japanese encompass our entire territory and capture our entire nation to boast proudly at the League of Nations Conference?</p>
<p>However, even though General Su has retreated, there are still countless General Sus in the Northeast. Learning from the past and being wary of the future, will our countrymen not rise up now?</p>

<p>Japan Asks the Soviet Union Not to Allow Su to Leave Russia</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Su Bingwen's troops retreated into Russian territory, the central government sent a telegram to Ping asking about his whereabouts and expressing condolences. Ping has forwarded the telegram to the Chinese delegation stationed in Moscow, asking them to convey it to Su Bingwen and to assist in handling the procedures for Su's troops to pass through Russian territory. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen, Zhang Dianjiu, Xie Ke, Jin Kuibi, and others are still on their way to Moscow. Ping received a telegram from Xie Ke stating that they are scheduled to arrive in the Russian capital next Wednesday or Thursday, and after a brief stay, they will transfer to Germany and the United States, and then to Geneva to report to the League of Nations. Su Bingwen's family has arrived in Vladivostok and will transfer to Shanghai and then to Ping in the coming days. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to official sources, the Japanese government formally applied to the Soviet Russian government several days ago for the extradition of General Su Bingwen, but Karakhan firmly rejected it. Therefore, on February 9th, the Japanese government submitted a second application to the Soviet Russian government, requesting a guarantee that General Su Bingwen would not leave Russian territory and would not engage in propaganda activities. No reply has been received yet. It is generally believed that the Soviet Russian government will still refuse because it is clear that they have already allowed Su to leave Russia. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army Headquarters received a report from Colonel Komatsubara stating that the Russian consulate replied that Soviet government laws clearly stipulate the responsibility to protect political prisoners, so they cannot comply with the Japanese army's request. It is reported that the Japanese army immediately telegraphed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, instructing the acting ambassador to Russia, Mr. Amano, to discuss the transfer of anti-Japanese generals with the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee. It is rumored that the Japanese side wants to use a non-aggression treaty as an exchange condition and insists that Su Bingwen and others are not political prisoners, but murderers who killed Japanese residents, and should be extradited to Japan according to the World Criminal Exchange Treaty as an example. The Japanese side's fear of anti-Japanese generals can be said to be extreme. (10th Hualian News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to meet at 3:30 PM on the 12th (10:30 PM Shanghai time) and has decided to invite the United States and Russia to form a mediation committee to carry out mediation. Although the Japanese side opposes the participation of the United States and Russia, it will not be able to prevent its realization. It is reported that when the Committee of Nineteen meets, it will invite Chinese and Japanese representatives to participate, so our representative is still residing in Geneva. (10th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to the order published today, the Special Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to reconvene on Sunday to pass a resolution suggesting to the League of Nations General Assembly to invite the United States and Russia to participate in negotiations to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is expected that the General Assembly will resolve to proceed accordingly and then announce an adjournment until mid- of next year. It is generally believed that the Chinese delegation will protest against the League of Nations' use of delaying tactics to handle such an important and urgent case. (10th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is rumored that the US and Russian representatives to the Twenty-Nation Conference will be Mr. Davis from the United States and Mr. Litvinov from Russia. Whether China and Japan will participate has not yet been determined. (10th Hualian Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to meet on Sunday to consider the issue of inviting the United States and Russia to participate in mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute. The resolution on this matter must be approved by the League of Nations General Assembly, so the General Assembly will be convened on Tuesday or Wednesday. The League of Nations has not yet found a way out of its difficulties because the United States may demand that the League of Nations make a statement on principles before agreeing to participate. Some parties suggest that the resolution should be based on not recognizing Manchukuo during the negotiations, but given Japan's attitude, this move is bound to cause new conflicts in the General Assembly. Other parties advocate inviting the United States and Russia to participate unconditionally. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Mr. Hymans has returned to Brussels to handle departmental affairs and will be replaced by Mr. Motta, the Swiss representative and honorary chairman of the League of Nations General Assembly, as chairman of the Committee of Nineteen to preside over the meeting. It is reported that the committee will hold a closed-door meeting, and the representatives of China and Japan will only participate when the committee deems it necessary to hear their opinions. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Official circles report that whether the United States will participate in the mediation committee depends on the terms of the commission and the precise relationship between the committee and the League of Nations. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has clearly telegraphed its attitude towards the Special Committee of Nineteen to Geneva, reiterating that it cannot recognize the binding effect of any resolution. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) On the 9th, the League of Nations General Assembly elected Mr. Avenol of France as Secretary-General of the League of Nations, succeeding Mr. Drummond, who is about to retire. The new Secretary-General, Mr. Avenol, was born in 1879 and served as the economic counselor of the French Embassy in the United Kingdom during the European War. He was later appointed as a member of the French Supreme Economic Council. After the European War, he repeatedly represented France at various important international conferences. In 1913, he was appointed as Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations, serving in the League of Nations Secretariat for nearly ten years, and was gradually promoted to his current position.</p>
<p>(Geneva) Our Chief Representative Yan Huiqing sent a letter yesterday to Mr. Hymans, Chairman of the Committee of Nineteen, requesting a definite time limit for the Special Committee to submit recommendations to the General Assembly for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute, and informing him that unless Japan changes its unreasonable attitude, there is little hope of reconciliation.

<p>(Geneva) It was learned today from extremely reliable sources that if the British efforts to resolve the issue fail, Britain is prepared to apply the sanctions in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to Japan. However, before adopting this extreme measure, Foreign Secretary Simon will exhaust all possible methods to seek mediation. Therefore, Simon is preparing to propose inviting China and Japan, as well as Russia and the United States, to participate in the work of the Committee of Nineteen. Even if the four countries cannot participate in the actual discussions, they should at least be present as observers. If this attempt still fails, he is prepared to recommend to the British government to adopt the most severe methods stipulated in the Covenant. (10th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>According to Article 16, the system includes: 1. Economic blockade; 2. The Executive Council recommends to all members to send land, sea, and air forces to organize an army to maintain the Covenant; 3. Announcing its expulsion from the organization.</p>

<p>(Geneva) Reuters learned from responsible sources that the rumor that Britain is prepared to invoke the sanctions stipulated in Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant against Japan if the mediation efforts fail is unfounded. It is likely that this rumor is due to a misunderstanding of British Foreign Secretary Simon's speech in the General Assembly, as Simon stated that the British government wants to act as a faithful member of the League of Nations.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly has closed. The resolution of this meeting is empty and impractical, and it is not as good as the two resolutions of September 30th and December 10th last year, which could still gloss over the surface. It is reported that the outcome of this meeting is greatly related to the change in Britain's attitude. The speech of British representative Simon was very unfavorable to us, and his Canadian representative even added insult to injury. The small countries are extremely dissatisfied with this resolution, believing that the General Assembly did not impose sanctions on Japan based on the faithful records of the Lytton Report and the spirit of last year's resolution, causing great damage to the dignity of the League of Nations Covenant and the maintenance of justice.

<p>Diplomatic Circles are Disappointed with the League of Nations</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The reporter visited various important figures in diplomatic circles today to inquire about their opinions on this League of Nations General Assembly. They all expressed obvious disappointment. Since the opening, although the Lytton Report has been used as the basis for discussion, the resolution is so empty, which is truly incomprehensible. As for the responsibility for the September 18th Incident and the non-recognition of "Manchukuo," no specific resolutions were made, which is most regrettable. The resolution of the withdrawal of the Japanese army from the previous two resolutions has been forgotten, which greatly impacts the credibility of the League of Nations. The officials stated that although the government is closely watching the progress of the Committee of Nineteen, it no longer places complete hope in the League of Nations for the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. If the League of Nations cannot guarantee world peace and justice, then the Chinese people should exert their own strength to recover lost territory. They firmly believe that economic severance and the resistance of the righteous armies are legitimate means, and if they can persist in this way for a long time, they will surely achieve the final victory.

<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting at 5:00 PM on the 9th at the Foreign Affairs Bureau. Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee in and out of Beijing and special secretaries attended to discuss the telegram from our delegation in Geneva, reporting that the Sino-Japanese issue would soon be transferred to the Committee of Nineteen for discussion on the 12th, or that the United States and Russia would join the Committee of Nineteen to form a mediation committee. The strategies that our country should adopt in the international mediation committee were discussed and decided at the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting the day before. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed the Geneva delegation to proceed accordingly on the afternoon of the 10th. It is reported that the instructions generally state that our country does not oppose the organization of the mediation committee and the participation of the United States and Russia, but only if the methods that do not violate the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations can be accepted.

<p>(Beiping) According to foreign sources, recently Puyi and the Japanese Ambassador to Manchukuo, Muto Nobuyoshi, and others have been actively preparing to change to an imperial system, restore the Great Qing dynasty, and continue to use the Xuantong reign title. This proposal is initiated by the Japanese, and the main reasons are: (1) Manchukuo is afraid that it will be difficult to pass the League of Nations General Assembly and obtain international status; (2) After the restoration of the Great Qing dynasty, it can continue to restore the sovereignty of the territory ruled by the Great Qing dynasty; (3) It can avoid the threat from Soviet Russia; (4) After Manchukuo is renamed the Great Qing dynasty, it can seek the sympathy of general royalists and backward rural Chinese; (5) The impression of the Great Qing dynasty is deeper and easier to appeal to.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese are actively pursuing their railway aggression policy in the Northeast. In addition to rushing to build the Jidun Railway and completing the Jihui Railway, they are now planning to build a direct Jilin-Harbin railway, making it cross the river and connect with the Huhai Railway. Then, it will extend north from Hailun to Keshan, connecting with the Qike Line. It can pass through the Sitao Railway and the South Manchuria Main Line, forming a unified whole, linked together. Adding the Jichang, Jihai, and Shenhai Railways, it will form a road network. Afterwards, it can pass through the Chinese Eastern Railway and connect with each other. This road started construction simultaneously on the 20th of last month at both ends near the suburbs of Jilin and Harbin, starting to build the roadbed and build the river bridge, which will start soon. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Due to the South Manchuria Railway's recent revision of its official system, based on the "one ministry and two bureaus" system of railways, it will set up a branch line management bureau in Shenyang, which is geographically advantageous. Preparatory personnel will arrive in Shenyang soon, and it is scheduled to open at the end of this year or next spring. The organization of the management bureau is still kept secret. In general, it includes all the necessary general affairs, business operations, transportation, and other construction-related matters for all railways outside the company. In order to operate this new agency, the South Manchuria Railway headquarters in Dalian will dispatch about 300 employees related to the railway department to Shenyang. All Manchuria railways, which have been laissez-faire and unregulated in the past, will be managed in an orderly manner under this new agency.

<p>Financial Revenue and Expenditure Deficit Reaches 100 Million in Five Months in Japan</p>
<h3 id="e50">Exchange Rate Countermeasures: Conflicting Opinions in Japanese Cabinet, Shaking Political Situation; Korekiyo Takahashi Resolves to Manage Exchange Rates, Takao Nakajima Advocates Balancing Funds <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 10th - According to the Japanese Ministry of Finance's public announcement, in just five months from April to August of this year, the national treasury deficit has reached 126,779,000 yen. Among them, tax revenue decreased by 38,741,000 yen compared with the same period last year, stamp duty revenue decreased by 1,155,000 yen, and revenue from state-run businesses decreased by 8,860,000 yen.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 10th - According to Finance Minister Takahashi's reply to the leaders of the Minseito Party yesterday, the Japanese Ministry of Finance intends to manage exchange rates. After ordering various banks to report the actual figures of exchange rate inflows and outflows immediately, many malpractices were discovered. Moreover, both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties will use exchange rate countermeasures as the primary issue to criticize the government. It is heard that Takahashi has made up his mind to order the Ministry of Finance to formulate various laws and regulations related to exchange rate management, which will be submitted to the 64th National Diet for review.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 10th - Because the Japanese exchange rate continues to fall, the lives of the people are becoming increasingly difficult, especially for the middle class and officials. In view of this, both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties intend to use the exchange rate countermeasure issue to make things difficult for the government in the Diet. It is rumored that Finance Minister Takahashi will use exchange rate management as a countermeasure, ordering the Ministry of Finance to formulate a bill to be submitted to the next Diet session. Recently, Commerce Minister Nakajima suddenly opposed, saying that exchange rate management is not the best policy and that a foreign exchange equalization fund system should be adopted. The Ministry of Finance should issue five hundred million yen in treasury bonds, with the funds as collateral, so that the Bank of Japan can issue five hundred million yen in gold notes to be used for controlling exchange rates, with the loss borne by the national treasury. Nakajima said that this plan will be discussed with Railway Minister Mitsuchi and then submitted at the cabinet meeting. If so, opinions will diverge again, and obstacles to the future of the Japanese political situation will increase.</p>
<p>Five-Power Disarmament Talks</p>
<h3 id="e51">The German View on Equality and the French View on Security are Still Far Apart <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 9th - After a dinner party tonight, the representatives of the five major powers for disarmament talked until late at night. Although no complete agreement was reached, France is willing to allow Germany not only equality in status, but also actual equality in armaments, only insisting that Germany must gradually achieve this equality and must recognize that, according to the Treaty of Versailles, it should reduce armaments. The representatives attending the dinner party agreed to reconvene at 2:30 pm on Saturday to continue discussing this matter. Before the dinner party, British Prime Minister MacDonald had a secret talk with US representative Davis for two hours, attempting to resolve the deadlock formed by Germany's insistence on equality and France's insistence on security. Afterwards, during the dinner party, although the views of Germany and France were still far apart, they were able to eliminate some disputes. France explained in detail the reasons why its security requirements must be implemented. After discussion, the European representatives expressed the hope that the United States would guarantee non-interference when sanctions under Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant are implemented in the future, and also expressed the hope that Britain would guarantee its willingness to implement these sanctions.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Japanese Disarmament Proposal to be Released Today</p>
<h3 id="e52">Based on Opposition to the US Proposal, the Disarmament General Committee to Convene on Wednesday <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 10th - According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese disarmament representative formally submitted the Japanese naval disarmament proposal yesterday. This proposal was first explained to the UK, the US, Ambassador Sato to Italy and France by Ambassador Matsudaira in Geneva on the morning of the 5th, explaining Japan's true intentions. The Japanese representative said that the Japanese proposal has two major principles: first, taking defense as the principle of national defense, abolishing offensive forces; second, paying attention to the environment and special circumstances and opposing uniform reductions. The specific contents are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Battleships": The ship type, number, and armament must be reduced uniformly. (2) "Cruisers": Class A and Class B cruisers must uniformly reduce the ship type, number, and armament, just like battleships. (3) "Aircraft Carriers": These are offensive weapons, and auxiliary mother ships must be abolished together. This point is specifically aimed at the United States. (4) "Naval Aircraft": Considered offensive weapons, they must be abolished uniformly. (5) "Submarines": Submarines were the most terrifying offensive weapons during the European War. Japan believes they are defensive weapons and opposes abolishing them, only agreeing to reduce them proportionally.</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's proposal, diplomatic circles generally expect Japan to use avoidance of responsibility as a strategy, because opposing the proposals of the UK and the US, without proposing constructive proposals, will place the full responsibility for the failure of the meeting on Japan. This Japanese proposal, in addition to avoiding responsibility, has no new principles to be seen.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 10th - The full text of the Japanese Navy's disarmament proposal is scheduled to be released in Geneva at 7 pm today (3 am tomorrow, Japan time), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo will also release it at the same time.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Geneva, 10th - The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference is scheduled to convene on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>French Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee Approves Repayment of US Installments</p>
<h3 id="e53">Final Attitude Still Depends on the Chamber of Deputies, Britain Decides to Settle US Debt in Cash <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 9th - The French Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee today voted to approve the payment of the December installment of the debt owed to the US, but this resolution is conditional on convening a general assembly to investigate the war debt issue. French Prime Minister Herriot reported on recent events before the Foreign Affairs Committee vote, especially on talks related to financial and diplomatic events. The French Prime Minister has now received a reply from the United States, which rejects the deferral of the December debt installment and reiterates President Hoover's view that the war debt issue can be resolved in the future by commercially compensating the United States. The US reply to France is generally the same as the letter to Britain, acknowledging that the French government, like other governments, faces significant difficulties in the budget, but stating that the current payment and its remittance do not seem to have a significant adverse impact on the world economy or the recovery of prosperity. President Hoover acknowledged the value of France's explanation of the flow of cash into France, but said that France's possession of this gold seems to be closely related to the current difficulty in remittance. It is expected that the French Prime Minister will not change his policy of paying the December installment. As for whether France should break its promise, thus destroying the Anglo-French agreement within the week, it is up to the Chamber of Deputies to decide.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - It is heard that the British government has decided to settle the US debt installment due on December 15 in cash, totaling US$95.5 million. This cash may be transferred through accounts, so it may not be shipped to the United States immediately.</p>
<p>German Parliament Adjourns</p>
<h3 id="e54">Government's Future Full of Thorns <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 9th - The German Parliament adjourned today, with no date set for reconvening. It is expected to reopen around January 15. Before the adjournment today, a bill was passed, revoking part of the emergency decree issued by President Hindenburg in September, which allowed employers to reduce wages after hiring additional workers, declaring that Parliament does not recognize wage cuts as a necessary part of economic reform. Also, a pardon bill was passed by a vote of 595 to 144, either releasing or greatly reducing the sentences of all political prisoners, and stipulating that criminal offenses arising from economic decline should be reduced in punishment. However, there were no changes regarding capital punishment and penalties for violating the ban on political terrorism, and penalties for treason and violation of regulations on storing explosive materials.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 10th - Most newspapers regard the adjournment of Parliament as a victory for Chancellor Schleicher, because Schleicher can take a breather during the adjournment period to prepare his administrative procedures and be able to silence the opposition party when Parliament reconvenes in January next year. However, Schleicher's future still has many thorns, because the Nazi Party may not support him again in the future. Newspapers expect that Parliament may be dissolved again in January next year.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 10th - There is a growing trend of disobedience to Hitler's leadership within the Nazi Party, due to dissatisfaction with Hitler's policy of not getting everything and getting nothing. The leader of the opposition is Strasser, who is the director of the National Organization Department of the Nazi Party. Although he opposes Hitler now, he has not yet openly rebelled against him. Strasser is currently on a three-week leave of absence. Some say that this diplomatic leave is the beginning of a major split in the Nazi Party. Strasser advocates showing some leniency towards the Schleicher government to avoid the possibility of a new election, but Hitler firmly rejects this proposal. Shortly after the announcement of Strasser's three-week leave of absence, Strasser's close friend Feder, the director of the economic division of the Nazi Party, was also reported to be on leave. It is heard that Feder wrote to Hitler, claiming that the current policy adopted by the party hinders the party's power, and that the government's economic department should not be dissolved to avoid causing misunderstandings and losing trust. It is heard that Nazi welfare official Frick and influential journalist Rosenberg are also among the opposition. It is rumored that the opposition has gained the sympathy of at least 50 of the 195 Nazi members of parliament. According to the views of Strasser and others, Hitler's desire to be elected to the presidency prevents the Nazi Party's movement from being combined with the application of national construction power. After Strasser and others took leave, the radicals in the party, such as Parliament Speaker Goering, became more powerful.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 9th - The US President's reform plan to massively merge redundant agencies and change the functions of various departments and bureaus has been made into a special report, which was released in Congress this afternoon. The content includes the abolition of several larger bureaus and committees, and the merger and reorganization of 58 offices. Four deputy ministers are added to the Department of the Interior, responsible for education, public works, health and fitness, and agriculture and land use. All redundant agencies related to these categories are merged into the department, that is, most of the engineering duties currently under the Army Department, including important river and harbor projects, will be transferred to the Department of the Interior. Also, all merchant ship agencies, such as the Shipping Bureau and the Emergency Fleet Corporation, are merged into the Department of Commerce. As for the program to save government expenses after the merger, the President's report did not estimate it, only stating that the expenses of the agencies currently being merged total 700 million gold yuan per year, and a large portion should be saved after the merger is implemented. Also, if Congress does not object to this reform plan, it will be implemented in two months.</p>

The attendees of today's meeting were mostly leading cotton spinners, manufacturers, merchants, and shippers. A resolution was passed requesting the government to find ways to curb competition, and three measures were proposed as follows: (1) British goods in Indian colonies and territories should not be subject to import duties except for national taxes. (2) The taxes levied in the above areas should give British products a fair opportunity to compete. (3) The above plan should be in line with appropriate agreements on preferential trade between various parts of the British Empire.</p>

<h3 id="e61">US Farmers Petition Congress <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 9th - Today, US farmers went to Congress to petition, gathering in the audience seats, and striving to have their petitions accepted first, and then discussing other cases. Even the President's special report on reorganizing government agencies was regarded as insignificant. Congress had no choice but to read their petitions first, and the reading of the President's report was delayed for two hours. The content of their petitions focused on rescuing agriculture, demanding the enactment of laws sufficient to raise prices, and suspending payments on rural loans, and listing many previously petitioned relief plans. After the reading of the petitions was completed, the farmers left together, and Congress was able to read the President's report. It is reported that several committees in Congress have already begun to consider rural relief plans, but although this move is the most urgent plan at present, it is very difficult to handle. The plan to increase tariffs proposed by the Republican Party may be abandoned because the Democratic government will oppose increasing tariffs.</p>
<p>The Great Success of the Fascist Exhibition (Rome Communication)</p>

<h3 id="e62">The Pride in the Success and Spirit of the Italian Fascists Ten Years Ago <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Italy participated in the European War as one of the Allied powers, and its sacrifices were second only to France. Therefore, although it possessed the name of a victorious country after the war, its vitality was declining and people's livelihood was deteriorating, and it was almost unable to recover. Coupled with the rampant red forces, all industries were abandoned, and the domestic economy was even more desolate, to the point where it could not be salvaged. Mussolini took the opportunity to rise up, establish the Fascist regime, save the situation from collapse, and enable Italy to return to strength. Mussolini's great achievements are truly indelible events in history, and they were also created by the opportunity. Ten years ago, in June 1922, after the Fascists destroyed the Socialist Party's General Alliance strike plan and then went on to destroy its base camp, Mussolini's momentum was unstoppable. At that time, the Italian government was the weak and incompetent Facta cabinet, so the domestic industrialists and businessmen had already hoped that Mussolini would come out and take power at this time. Unfortunately, the Fascists were an absolute minority in parliament, and it was impossible to gain power through peaceful means, so they had to resort to violence and decided to launch an attack on October 28, occupying important cities and marching on Rome. In two days, the overall situation was settled, and the Fascist regime was established. It has been exactly ten years until the end of October this year, so it was decided to hold a grand celebration to celebrate the success of the Fascists.</p>
<p>The National Beiping Library Newly Collects a Large Batch of Antiques</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Ho Family of Houguan Deposits Them, and a Special Room Will Be Opened for Display <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the new National Beiping Library, many collectors at home and abroad have deposited rare books and antiques. After the Liang family of Xinhui deposited their family collection of books and inscriptions in the library, others followed suit every year, such as Zhu Min of Zijiang depositing the legacy of the German Mullendorf, and Qu of Changsha depositing his family collection of books. He Sui (号叙甫) of Houguan is famous for collecting Han tile ends. This spring, he deposited a part of the tile ends, as well as a tombstone of the great chieftain of the United States from the Tang Kaiyuan period of the New Germany, a vermilion-written Xiping four-year tile pot, and a vermilion-written Heng character tile. In the autumn and winter, Ho returned from his tour of Shaanxi and deposited all the antiques he had obtained over the years in the library for safekeeping. There are 660 Han and Tang tile ends, 130 Han and Tang ancient mirrors, including an iron mirror inlaid with mother-of-pearl, which is the rarest item, as well as 125 Yin Ruins oracle bones, a full copy of the original rubbings of ancient New Zheng artifacts, two large boxes and eight thick volumes of other bronze and stone rubbings, and 20 volumes of Chen Zhongzhai's collection of tile end rubbings, including a volume of tile end rubbings from Lelang Prefecture, which is the most precious, as well as 24 volumes of Ho's family collection of tile end rubbings, a Han Miao bronze drum, a Han foundation stone glazed head, four Qin and Han mausoleum bricks, a stone carving of the Heart Sutra in Tang Fei Xiu's calligraphy, a rubbing of the iron pagoda in the sixth year of the Southern Han Dabaobao, the pagoda is in Guangzhou, 18 feet high, and some other scattered small items, as well as books, painting albums, and photos. It is heard that the library intends to open a special room for display to encourage those who are inspired by the news.</p>
<p>Although the grand anniversary celebration of this year is scheduled for October 28, it has actually been celebrated throughout the country since October 1, so it is no exaggeration to call October the celebration month. Among the various arrangements for the celebration, the most noteworthy is the exhibition of achievements over the past ten years. Among them, the two exhibitions, "Victory of the Grain War" and "Development of New Cultivated Land," are the most interesting, because Mussolini regarded these as his greatest achievements, so he specifically listed them in detail, but the general audience found them too numerous. The entrance to the halls where the exhibits are displayed is decorated with huge words "Faith, Obedience, Struggle," which are the supreme beliefs of the Fascists and are truly representative of the spirit of their general members. In the "Exhibition of Revolutionary Deeds" Hall in Via Naziona, four huge axes are displayed to symbolize the Fascists' destruction of all old forces. All the relics of the internal strife in Italy from 1919 to 1922 are listed here. There are more than 17,000 pieces of collected historical materials, but the "victims of internal strife" enshrined in them are limited to Fascist Party members. The collection of historical materials begins with Mussolini's advocacy of joining the Allied forces to participate in the war. The first issue of Mussolini's Italian People's Daily, which he founded, was enlarged to a huge size and displayed,</p>
<p>First (the publication date of the first issue was November 15, 1914), seeing it still makes people imagine Mussolini in the Milan editorial office at that time. According to the order of display, going on to view the various exhibition halls, the Fascists' movement starting from Milan, the twists and turns, the recoveries, and the final seizure of power to the success of today are all displayed without omission according to their historical progress. The layout is actually a large-scale historical museum, but its vibrant spirit is incomparable to ordinary museums.</p>
<p>Being in it is like personally participating in the struggle of the past eighteen years. Another section is dedicated to displaying various domestic and foreign works on Mussolini's life and the Fascists, totaling more than 3,000 kinds, in various languages. Mussolini's portraits and sculptures are everywhere, totaling no less than several thousand kinds, large and small. Mussolini's slogans and maxims are used in huge characters and in various colors to reflect on the halls, and the handwriting of the famous Italian writer D'Annunzio is also displayed to accompany them. The furnishings and decorations of the exhibition hall are not very gorgeous, because they do not want to hinder the expression of the revolutionary spirit due to the decorations, but the art of the Futurists can be seen everywhere, and the heroic spirit that fills all the arrangements is especially the characteristic felt by the viewers. "Italy is ours! Italy is ours!" "Three days of Fascism is better than four years of incompetent government!" This is indeed the proud words of the Fascists, and their achievements are also worthy of pride. This exhibition in Rome fully expresses this spirit. (Posted on November 6)</p>

<p>He Chengjun Returns to Hankou</p>
<h3 id="e65">Northern Hubei Administrative Office Revoked; Fan and Zhang Share Defense Responsibilities <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, previously received an order from Chairman Chiang to be stationed in Laohekou to supervise the suppression of Xu and He's remnant bandits. An office was established there, and he personally assumed command. Subsequently, due to the intrusion of Red Bandits deep into Shaanxi Province, Shaanxi Chairman Yang Hucheng telegraphed requesting that he move to Xi'an to supervise the suppression from nearby. He Chengjun agreed to go immediately, but due to a sudden onset of hemorrhoids, requiring urgent treatment, he was unable to make the trip. Instead, he dispatched Chen Guangzu, Director of the Pacification Office, as his representative to report on everything. At this time, Chairman Chiang telegraphed summoning him to Hankou for a face-to-face inquiry about the bandit suppression situation. He Chengjun originally intended to return south by plane, but due to his illness, he was unable to fly. Therefore, he returned to Hankou by car on the morning of the 8th. The day before, he convened Northern Hubei generals in Laohekou and gave instructions on post-bandit suppression and post-disaster relief. He also telegraphed the troops pursuing the bandits into Shaanxi Province to actively suppress the remnant bandits and personally went to various hospitals to comfort the wounded and sick officers and soldiers involved in the bandit suppression, distributing funds for recuperation, amounting to 200 yuan per person for colonels and regimental commanders, 100 yuan per person for majors and battalion commanders, 50 yuan per person for captains and company commanders, 30 yuan for lieutenants, 20 yuan for second lieutenants, 10 yuan for warrant officers, 6 yuan per person for seriously wounded soldiers, 1 yuan per person for sick soldiers, and 5 yuan per person for sick officers. At 7:00 AM on the 8th, accompanied by all personnel of the Administrative Office, Chief of Staff Guan Linshu, Senior Staff Officer Yang Yadong, Councilor Xiong Zhiyuan, Staff Officers Xu Xuzhong and Guan Wenhui, Secretary Li Peng, Aides-de-Camp Wen Zhenfan and Zhao Yixue, and Quartermaster Zhu Xiangwen, etc., he departed Laohekou in seventeen cars, and the Administrative Office was immediately revoked. At 9:30 AM, he arrived in Fancheng, passed through Zaoyang County at around 10:00 AM, and arrived in Huayuan at 6:00 PM. At 12:00 PM that evening, he boarded a special train on the Pinghan Railway to the south, without stopping along the way. At 3:00 AM on the 9th, he arrived at the Dazhimen Station in Hankou, where various dignitaries welcomed him. After getting off the train, he returned to his private residence to rest, as the sky was still dark. At 8:00 AM, he went to Yihua Village to meet with Chairman Chiang and report on the bandit suppression and the latest deployments. At 1:00 PM, he went to the Pacification Office to review documents and meet with Zhu Shaoliang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Border Area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, Li Dingwu, Commander of the Third Brigade, Chen Han, Director of the Tenth Army's Hankou Office, and Wang Shiliu and Yu Yuzhi, members of the Provincial Party Headquarters. In the evening, he made the following statement to the press: 1. When the two groups of Red Bandits, Xu Xiangqian and He Long, previously fled to Northern Hubei, they led more than 16,000 bandits. After our army's successive encirclements and suppressions, more than half of them were lost. Currently, Xu's bandits only have 4,000 to 5,000 people left, and He's bandits only have 1,000 to 2,000 people left, fleeing to Foping, west of Xi'an and south of Fengxiang. When the remnant bandits entered Shaanxi, Shaanxi Chairman Yang Hucheng telegraphed requesting that I go to Xi'an to command and supervise the suppression. Commander-in-Chief Chiang also telegraphed urging me to go, but due to my hemorrhoids not healing, I was unable to make the trip. Currently, the military affairs of bandit suppression have been entrusted to Shaanxi Army's Feng Qincai Division, and Zhang Hongyuan and Wang Zhiyuan's brigades, together with the pursuit units, are encircling and suppressing them. Before I arrive in Xi'an, the command will be temporarily under Director Yang Hucheng. Chen Zhixin (i.e., Chen Guangzu) was previously dispatched to Shaanxi to consult with Yang. He departed from Xi'an on the 8th and spent the night in Tongguan, returning to Hankou via Zhengzhou on the 9th. There are still many scattered bandits hiding in Northern Hubei, so troops must be stationed there to defend it. The area west of Laohekou has been assigned to Fan Shisheng's 51st Division to clear and suppress, and the Xiangfan area has been assigned to Zhang Zhenhan's 41st Division to clear and suppress. The deployments are now in place. After the disaster in Northern Hubei, the markets are deserted. Local self-defense and baojia have been started, but it remains to be seen how complete and proper they will be. 2. The Sichuan Army is returning to Sichuan, and Yichang will be taken over by the 9th Division. The handover is imminent. Because of the heavy task of suppressing bandits, I originally planned not to attend the Third Plenary Session, so I did not prepare any proposals. Recently, I received telegraphic requests from various parties, so I decided to attend. I will leave Hankou for Nanjing in the coming days." (December 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Garrison Troop Adjustments in Southern Jiangxi and Guangdong-Guangxi <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>(First Army Reinforces with a Brigade to Station in Shangyou; Zhang Division of the Second Army Transfers to Xinfeng Area; Wang Division of the Guangxi Army Takes Over San'nan in Xinfeng)</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Liu Zhennian's troops have been stationed in northern Fujian, the strength of the bandit suppression army in Jiangxi Province has greatly increased. The communist bandits led by Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Dong Zhentang, and Luo Binghui, who had gathered on the border of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, now have a plan to flee again. Therefore, there are widespread rumors that the Jiangxi communist bandits have a tendency to attack Zhejiang and flee to Guangdong. However, based on their actual strength, the pseudo-Fifth Army Group is scattered in the northwest of Fujian Province, and Peng Dehuai's pseudo-Third Army Group is eyeing Nancheng and Nanfeng. In addition to the central army units of Jiangxi Province encircling the bandit area, the central government has again dispatched two divisions to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression, aiming to wipe them out in one fell swoop. In Fujian Province, the supplementary brigade of Tan Qixiu was recently dispatched to Yongchun on the 28th of last month. Commander Tan has already led the third regiment of Zheng Xingcha, the guard regiment of Li Jinbo, to their destination to search for the remnants of Chen Guohui and guard against the disturbances of the local communists. As for the southern Jiangxi area, in order to strictly prevent the communist bandits from fleeing south, the Guangdong army has also been actively deploying, with various units transferring to consolidate defenses. The southwest of Jiangxi is still being guarded by Yu Hanmou's First Army. Recently, in order to increase strength, Commander Yu has telegraphed the Second Independent Brigade of Chen Zhang in the rear to go to Shangyou for joint defense. After receiving the order, Chen Zhang is scheduled to depart from Dayu on the 6th. The terrain in the San'nan and Xinfeng areas is also important. A few days ago, 2,000 communist bandits attacked Xinfeng City from Wangmu Ferry. The Guangxi Army's Wang Zanbin Division counterattacked, and Zhang Meixin's Fourth Division of the Guangdong Army in San'nan also attacked from Longnan. Last month, they successfully defeated the Wangmu Ferry communist bandits and captured a large number of them. After this battle, the Guangdong and Guangxi armies in the area believed that it was necessary to change the joint defense, so they agreed to transfer the Fourth Division of the Second Army in San'nan with Wang Zanbin's Guangxi Army in Xinfeng. After receiving the order, the two division commanders Wang Zanbin's Division telegraphed the Shaoguan rear office to send the healed wounded soldiers to Xinfeng for replenishment in order to move with the team. It is reported that the two divisions of Zhang and Wang began to move on the 1st of this month. The 44th Division of the Guangxi Army, Wang Zanbin's troops, stationed in Xinfeng, marched to San'nan, and the defense of Xinfeng was taken over by Zhang Meixin's Fourth Division of the Guangdong Army. The Second Army's headquarters also moved to Xinfeng with the Fourth Division, with Zhang Meixin still serving as the director of the Second Army's headquarters. The Fourth Division's 10th Regiment of Wu Jianxiong, the 11th Regiment of Kong Kequan, and the 12th Regiment of Chen Jing had already moved into the territory of Xinfeng from the defense of San'nan since the 2nd. The Teaching Regiment of Jiang Wu also returned to Xinfeng City from the vicinity of Anyuan. As soon as the deployment is completed, Zhang Meixin will return to the province to report everything and ask for instructions on future strategies. (December 5th)</p>
<p>Increased Import Tax in the Nanyang Islands</p>
<h3 id="e67">Decision to Implement on New Year's Day; Great Impact on the Sales of National Goods <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The British Nanyang Malay Islands have always adopted an open trade free system, roughly the same as Hong Kong. However, in recent years, the world's economic situation has undergone major changes, and industries have declined. The Nanyang's local products, such as rubber and tin ingots, have been greatly affected. Therefore, the number of unemployed Chinese workers in the Malay Islands has increased sharply. The local government and overseas Chinese charitable organizations have immediately set up methods to accommodate the unemployed overseas Chinese and subsidize their return home. The British government has also issued orders to restrict the entry of Chinese workers, stipulating the number of passengers carried by ships from Shantou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Haikou each month. Each ship should sell tickets in proportion to the average number of passengers carried on weekdays. This regulation was promulgated in the spring of the previous year. Due to the ever-deteriorating economic situation in Nanyang, the regulation has been extended repeatedly, and the number of Chinese immigrants has gradually decreased. At present, the British Straits Settlements government only allows Shantou, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and Haikou to allow 900 Chinese to enter each month, which is independently controlled by the Da Xin, Da Gu, and He Tong shipping companies. However, these 900 people are cabin passengers, and women, children, and second-class cabin passengers holding passports are not restricted. In the past, about 10,000 overseas Chinese from Shantou went to Nanyang every month, but now the four ports combined are less than a thousand. Those seeking a living abroad naturally feel a sense of despair, but the shipping companies also suffer the same pain, because the expenses of each ship cannot be arbitrarily reduced due to this. Moreover, the relationship between Shantou and Singapore, the cargo transportation business, is also quite profitable. Therefore, the shipping companies, on the one hand, transfer their ships to routes to Siam, Saigon, Rangoon, Luzon, the Yangtze River, and the Chinese coast, and on the other hand, increase passenger fares. The price of a cabin ticket to Singapore was 36 yuan per ticket two years ago, then increased to 56 yuan, and now it has increased to 90 yuan. This is the official price of the agency company. Due to the fact that demand exceeds supply, each ticket often sells for more than 100 yuan. It is difficult for ordinary people to buy it unless they have a familiar inn to buy it for them. Furthermore, according to returning visitors from Singapore, the Legislative Council of the British Straits Settlements government has passed a regulation to increase import tariffs on goods, which will be implemented from New Year's Day next year. This move is of great concern to Chinese business, because since the September 18th Incident, overseas Chinese have been happy to use national goods. The new products manufactured in Shanghai, such as porcelain, ironware, and canned food from Chaoshan, have a large market in the Nanyang Islands via Singapore. If tariffs are increased, the emerging vitality of Chinese goods will be greatly frustrated. Local Chinese merchants are certainly opposed to this, and Chaoshan merchants are also very concerned about it. (December 2nd)</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Shandong Will Jointly Manage Transportation</p>
<h3 id="e68">Shandong Construction Department Sends Personnel to Attend the Huai River Guidance Committee <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Construction Department has been actively preparing this year to dredge the southern Shandong Canal to promote water conservancy. The canal's tributaries, such as the Niutou River, the east and west Si Rivers, etc., will be completed one after another. Next spring, the canal itself will be dredged. Jiangsu opposed Shandong's independent management of transportation, and the dispute has not been resolved for a long time. Recently, the Huai River Guidance Committee held a meeting in Nanjing and sent a letter inviting Shandong Province to send personnel to participate. The dispute over the management of transportation between Jiangsu and Shandong will be discussed, with the aim of joint implementation. Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, has now dispatched technician Shi Andong and Kong Lingrong, Director of the Canal Engineering Bureau, to attend. Shi and Kong are scheduled to depart from Jinan on the 9th. I once visited Cao Liqing, Chief of the Construction Department, to inquire about everything. According to Cao, the rivers in southern Shandong have not been dredged for a long time. The Weishan Lake stores too much water, while the canal releases too little, losing its regulatory function. Most tributaries such as the Si River flow into Weishan Lake, averaging 1,000 cubic meters of water per second, while the canal only releases 400 to 500 cubic meters per second. If this continues, a large amount of rain in autumn and summer will cause floods, which is dangerous. Therefore, dredging the canal in this province is a crucial plan. The Jiangsu side is currently preparing to build the Lanjia Dam in Tongshan County and widen the Bulao River to divert the flow. The representatives of Shandong attending the Huai River Guidance Committee intend to request that Jiangsu limit the height of the Lanjia Dam in order to avoid obstructing the flow of water. If Jiangsu and Shandong can jointly dredge, so that the canal discharges more than 400 cubic meters per second, the Bulao River discharges 500 cubic meters per second, and the Yin River in Yixian County, Shandong, also discharges 170 cubic meters per second, then floods can be eliminated, and both provinces will benefit.

<p>Huang Lisan, an Anhui native, has been running a big cake shop on the Qianjie of the county for many years. The shop owner is extremely irritable and often quarrels with people. Today (the 10th) at 9:00 AM, a peddler named Wang Yinqiu came to the big cake shop to trade, carrying sweet potatoes on his shoulder for sale. Due to a dispute over the price, the shop owner immediately raised the knife for cutting cakes and stabbed the peddler Wang Yinqiu several times in the head and shoulder, causing blood to flow all over the ground. Passersby, filled with indignation, immediately called the police to arrest the assailant Huang Lisan and sent him and the injured Wang Yinqiu to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. It is now reported that Wang was sent to Songjiang County Hospital for treatment and is not in imminent danger, but his injuries are quite serious.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Financial Bureau Conceals Funds for Provincial Education, Detained and Pursued <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Zenrong, the former director of the Financial Bureau, served for more than a year. The bureau affairs were always presided over by Section Chief Feng Gengbai. He arbitrarily concealed and did not report the number of education funds that should be remitted to the Provincial Education Foundation and deposited them in the name of the Public Account at Songjiang Bank, hoping to earn interest. Later, the bank went bankrupt. The Provincial Education Management Office considered the situation to be corrupt and inferior, and requested the Provincial Government to order the Finance Department to immediately remove and detain him for investigation. The Finance Department ordered the county to investigate and reply. Last month, Xiao died of illness in Hangzhou and was temporarily replaced by Section Chief Feng. Now, Shen Bingde, a provincial commissioner, came to Songjiang to take office. Yesterday, during the liquidation and handover, Yang Zixian, Section Chief of the Foundation Office, and Sun Guozhang, a commissioner, came to Songjiang and found out that Xiao owed more than 23,000 yuan in education funds that should be remitted to the province, and that more than 53,000 yuan had been concealed, totaling more than 76,000 yuan. Only 15,000 yuan was remitted at the beginning of this month. They immediately telegraphed Director Niu Yongjian for instructions. Niu telegraphed County Magistrate Shen to strictly detain and pursue the personnel handled by Xiao until the full amount is recovered before they are released.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, when the Yue Temple vegetable market was busy with transactions, Shi, an inspector from the County Bureau of Weights and Measures, came to inspect. He found that the scales held by general buyers had not been corrected and collected them one by one, numbering more than 40. Subsequently, a certain cook protested, arguing that the peddlers had not yet corrected the scales according to the new regulations, so why should the buyers be asked to correct them first, causing obstacles to the transaction? Moreover, the value of a scale is at least more than one yuan, and the poor cannot afford to buy it. Moreover, the method of calculating new and old has not been fully publicized, and it is reckless to carry out suppression, which is close to punishing without teaching. The inspector immediately called the police to detain the cook and sent him to the Second Precinct. For a time, vegetable farmers gathered and almost caused a disturbance. After the supervisors of the Public Security Bureau persuaded them on the spot, the crowd gradually dispersed.</p>

<p>On the night of the 7th, more than ten bandits speaking with a northern accent suddenly came to the Luo Heqing home in Zhujiacun Township, Second District.

<p>The Yutai steamer traveling to Dongting East Mountain in Suzhou was robbed at 3:30 PM on the 9th. While passing through the Wangxiao Bay area, it encountered bandits robbing passengers Jin Youbo, Yan, etc. Four officers of the Water Police 8th Team, escorting the steamer, were shot and killed in a firefight, three were injured, and stray bullets hit two passengers. The bandits fled to West Taihu Lake. The situation has been reported in this newspaper. After the incident, the Water Police 3rd District, the county police, and the Suzhou-Songjiang water bandit suppression department all dispatched teams to pursue the bandits on the same day, but the bandits had gone far and could not be captured. Now, Shen, the head of the 3rd District of the Water Police, believes that in order to comfort and defend the Water Police 8th Team of Dongshan, which has gone to Taihu Lake to pursue the bandits, he has mobilized the police team to dispatch the 3rd Brigade to Dongshan to thicken security. Due to the robbery of the patrol ship's guns, which is like giving wings to a tiger, the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce believes that the Wangxiao Bay area is a vital route of travel and that the bandits are rampant and terrifying to merchants. It is necessary to establish a stronghold in the area to house a patrolling force. On the 10th, they sent a telegram to the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting that it swiftly be ordered to encircle and suppress the bandits, to recover the kidnapped travelers, to maintain safe travel, and to uphold commerce.</p>

<p>After several consultations between representatives of the two counties on the Fengnan boundary issue, the two sides' opinions gradually approached. Therefore, yesterday (the 9th), the governments of the two counties of Fengnan held a joint meeting in Shen's Lotus Garden in Nanqiao. The attendees included Kong Chong, County Magistrate of Nanhui, representatives Jiang Zhuoling, Chen Moquan, Zhang Jianqian, Shen Qingchan, County Magistrate of Fengxian, representatives He Zhiren, Zhang Xinjian, Ruan Xiyao, Jiang Wenhe, Zhu Ganye, Tao Jialin, and representatives of the 15 townships in the old Taiping Township of Nanhui, Pan Chengjiang and Yan Juting, totaling more than 20 people. First, the representatives of the two counties of Fengnan reported on their respective counties' recent claims regarding this case, and then the formal discussion began. As a result, the plan proposed by Nanhui County was adopted and supplemented, and five organizational proposals were formulated: 1. The 15 townships belonging to the old Taiping Township of Nanhui (i.e., part of the current tenth district) shall be designated as a unified autonomous region, and its district head shall be appointed by Nanhui County in accordance with the law after being recommended by Fengxian. 2. The Nanhui Puhan section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road (i.e., from Minhang opposite Puqi to the Gumutang Feng territory) within three li east and west shall be allocated to Fengxian for management. All police power in this section and criminal cases occurring in this section, as reported by the public security authorities in this section, shall be handled by Fengxian's administrative and judicial authorities. 3. Fengxian and Nanhui should organize a permanent dredging committee to handle the dredging of various trunk rivers in Fengxian that flow through Nanhui Jiang Taiping Heng Township and exit Pu. Fengxian shall account for two-thirds of the total number of members of the committee, and Nanhui shall account for one-third. The chairman of the committee shall be appointed by Fengxian. The expenses shall be allocated according to the length of the river, with equal distribution of land and labor. 4. Other construction and education matters related to the two counties shall also be handled in accordance with the above principles. 5.

<h3 id="e77">Provisional Measures for Agricultural Warehouse Mortgage <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi: In order to alleviate the rural economic crisis, the People's Bank is preparing to establish rural storage and mortgage warehouses. Five locations have been set up initially and have already begun accepting mortgage goods and providing loans. Now, the Provincial Agricultural Bank, aiming to promote this system throughout the province, has specially formulated eight provisional measures to be distributed to various county branches for compliance. The measures are as follows: (1) In order to regulate food supply and support the rural economy, in addition to the warehouses operated by various branches, the bank may cooperate with rice-producing counties in the province that deem it necessary to implement rice mortgage programs. (2) Under the aforementioned cooperative arrangement, counties intending to implement rice mortgage programs should possess suitable buildings, recommend responsible personnel, and notify the bank with a letter, as well as raise a sufficient amount of capital (at least 20,000 yuan) to be deposited with the bank. The bank will then double the received amount as cooperative capital. (3) After the warehouse is established, the Agricultural Bank will be responsible for receipts, disbursements, and accounting, while the local authorities will be responsible for management and safekeeping. Monthly reports should be submitted, but for clarity, both parties may conduct audits at any time to ensure transparency. (4) When recovering principal and interest, the funds from the Agricultural Bank's capital portion should be repaid first. (5) Farmers mortgaging goods to the warehouse will be calculated at 60% of the market price, and the monthly interest rate shall not exceed 1%. Handling fees and other expenses may be added based on local conditions. (6) The funds provided by local authorities shall accrue interest at a monthly rate of 8 per mille. At the end of the program, any surplus, after deducting expenses, shall be used for local public welfare. (7) The rice mortgaged by farmers should be limited to their own produce. The mortgage procedures shall follow the bank's warehouse procedures. (8) These measures shall be applicable before January of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933].</p>

<p>The business vehicles on the Wuxi-Cheng road, with the construction office ordering the Wuxi and Cheng county construction bureaus, have agreed upon a compromise to restore traffic, following the regulations allowing only eight vehicles per day. However, in practice, the traffic remains as frequent as before. Recently, due to the obstruction of road construction, workers are unable to work more than four hours a day due to avoiding vehicles, making it impossible to achieve the original plan of transporting 30 cubic meters of materials per day. After approval from the Construction Department, the long-distance bus company ordered the Wuxi and Cheng county magistrates to strictly crack down on the business vehicles, prohibiting them from driving on the section in order to ensure the completion of the road construction project as scheduled.</p>

<p>The Wuyi County Government has captured and brought before the court bandits Feng Abao and Cheng Yigen. After interrogation, they confessed to having committed robbery and kidnapping. They were sentenced to death, and the sentence was submitted to the provincial government for review. On the evening of the 9th, approval was received. Magistrate Zhang immediately dispatched police on the morning of the 10th to bring the bandits Feng Abao and Cheng Yigen to the execution ground outside Bo'ai Gate to verify their identities and carry out the execution by shooting.</p>

<p>Chenxiang Temple in Xiaorenqing, the fifteenth district of Wuyi, was suddenly attacked by armed bandits at approximately 3:00 AM on the 8th. They robbed important ornaments and severely burned the abbot, Yingxue, with fire, before fleeing after about an hour.

<p>Shazhou City in the fourth district of this county is mostly sandy land, and the villagers mainly grow cotton. Therefore, every autumn harvest, various yarn factories come to Xigang Changyinsha to set up cotton collection points to purchase cotton. Furthermore, due to the abundant harvest this year, there are more than twenty cotton collection points. However, regarding the business tax, the yarn factories have already determined the tax amount, and the cotton collection points are included. Now, the Business Tax Bureau of this county still requires each location to report and acknowledge the tax amount. As a result, the factories are jointly requesting instructions from the Department of Finance. Unexpectedly, the other day (the 7th), Gu Haoran from the Business Tax Bureau in the city was dispatched to the countryside to collect taxes. Because the instructions from the Department of Finance had not yet been reviewed, each location was unwilling to comply and pay, leading to a conflict in words. The manager of the Yikang Cotton Collection Point in Changyinsha was arrested. The cotton collection points, believing that the Business Tax Bureau officials had arrested someone without cause, jointly closed the market and stopped collecting cotton.</p>

Wooden sheds were set up at key land passages, stipulated to be closed every night at 9:00 PM and opened the next morning at 6:00 AM. Regarding anti-banditry matters, a guerrilla team was separately organized to handle them.</p>

<p>Four Central Committee Members, Including Deng Qingyang, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e84">Will Travel to the Capital Tonight to Attend the Plenary Session; Joint Proposal Focuses on Resistance Against Japan and Suppression of Bandits <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Four individuals, including Deng Qingyang, an alternate supervisory committee member of the Central Committee; Li Qian'an; and alternate executive committee members Guan Suren and Cui Guangxi, arrived in Shanghai on the 7th aboard the French postal ship "Qin Neng Su" from Hong Kong. The ship docked at the Huangpu Wharf in Tilanqiao at 10:00 AM yesterday. They disembarked around 11:00 AM. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Committee Members Deng and Guan on board the ship yesterday and inquired about the date of their trip to the capital and the contents of their proposals. They provided detailed answers.</p>
<p>(Deng Qingyang said) Most of the Guangdong members were unable to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee due to their official duties. I, along with Li Qian'an, Guan Suren, and Cui Guangxi, are relatively free, so we came to Shanghai specifically to travel to the capital and attend. However, regardless of whether they attend or not, all unanimously hope that the Central Committee can take responsibility and work hard to cope with the current national crisis. When I passed through Hong Kong on my way to Shanghai, I met with Mr. Hu Zhantang. Mr. Hu believed that it was impossible to force anyone to attend, but it was a good thing to be able to go to the capital and attend. Although Mr. Hu himself cannot attend due to illness, he did not give us any proposals to bring to the capital. However, Mr. Hu also holds the same hope, that the Central Committee can take responsibility and work hard to cope with the current national crisis. Rumors that Mr. Hu advocated not attending are inaccurate. The Guangdong authorities are currently working hard on construction, and the anti-Japanese sentiment among the people is extremely strong. The work of anti-Japanese organizations is very active, but it does not descend into clamor. Currently, Japanese goods have almost disappeared from the Guangzhou market. It is said that in North China and the Yangtze River area, Japanese goods are rampant, which is vastly different from Guangdong. I deeply hope that the anti-Japanese movement across the country will adopt the same pace as Guangdong, so that we can defeat the enemy and it is within our grasp. I am scheduled to take the night train to the capital with Mr. Li Qian'an on the 11th to attend the plenary session of the Supervisory Committee on the 12th. As for the proposals for the Third Plenary Session, I and Committee Members Li and Cui have already drafted a general proposal, which we will jointly submit to the plenary session for discussion, while my personal proposal is still being prepared.</p>
<p>(Guan Suren said) Among the Guangdong Committee members attending this Third Plenary Session, in addition to myself and Deng, Li, and Cui, there are several others who will come later, but the number is not large. I and Committee Members Deng, Li, and Cui have now drafted a proposal that we will jointly submit to the Third Plenary Session for discussion. The content focuses on actively resisting Japan and vigorously suppressing bandits. In addition, there will be criticism of the report of the League of Nations investigation team, and we will ask the Central Committee to instruct our representatives to the League of Nations to adopt a tough stance, to be unyielding, and to fight to the end. I have not met with the four Central Committee members Bai Wenwei, Zhang Zhiben, Liu Luyin, and Cheng Qian on this trip to Guangdong. I will stay in Shanghai for about one or two days, or will travel to the capital with Committee Member Deng and others tomorrow night (i.e., tonight).</p>
<p>(Cui Guangxi said) According to Mr. Cui Guangxi, speaking to a reporter from the New Voice Agency, they have not yet drafted any proposals and plan to draft them before entering the capital. The main points will be about how to thoroughly implement resistance against Japan and suppression of the communists. They cannot accept most of the International Investigation Team's report. They will have a meeting with Sun Zhesheng and other committee members tonight (i.e., last night) to finalize the proposals. They may add their names to Mr. Sun's proposal. Hu Zhantang has decided not to attend due to illness. Mr. Hu has been aging rapidly recently. He shares the same views as the other committee members regarding the proposals for resisting Japan and suppressing bandits at the Third Plenary Session. Liu Luyin also intends to come to Shanghai, but it is not yet known whether he can arrive before the meeting. In addition, Guangdong Committee members Wang Fangfu and Zhan Juci, as well as Guangxi Committee members Huang Xuchu and Li Renren, will continue to come to Shanghai and are expected to arrive here within about two days.</p>
<p>Li Jishen Leaves Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e85">For Change of Scenery for Health; Requests Removal From All Concurrent Positions <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Training Director Li Jishen asked for leave due to illness a month ago and came to Shanghai for treatment. Recently, he has not yet recovered, so he moved from his residence to a Western sanatorium on the Great West Road, where he was examined by Dr. Elster and his stool was tested by the Central Testing Laboratory. Many worm eggs were found, so it was said that these worms originated in the liver and affected the skin, so he often felt itchy all over and could not sleep at night. The doctor forbade him from eating meat and only allowed him to eat three thin slices of toast with each meal. He received an injection once a day. Although this had some effect after about two weeks, the doctor said that it was still advisable to move to another place for treatment. Coincidentally, his son, Peiwen, and daughter, Xiaomei, graduated from their studies in the United States and returned home via Europe. They should arrive in Hong Kong within a few days. Li loved his children, so he decided to return to Hong Kong first, partly to change scenery for health and partly to meet his children. Therefore, he boarded a certain postal ship yesterday to go abroad. It is said that before his departure, he telegraphed the Central Executive Committee and Chairman Chiang, and the original text is as follows: "To the Central Executive Committee in the capital: The Third Plenary Session is about to open. I hope that comrades will unite sincerely and jointly overcome the national crisis. Jishen is untalented and ashamed that he cannot participate in the grand event due to his long illness. Recently, according to the German doctor, the illness originates from the liver and appears on the skin. It will not be easy to achieve results without a change of scenery for treatment. I will buy a boat and return to my hometown immediately. I specially telegraph to ask for leave. Please understand. Li Jishen respectfully seals. To Chairman Chiang in Hankou and Nanjing: Jishen asked for leave last month to go to Shanghai for medical treatment due to illness. After a long time, he has not yet recovered. Recently, Dr. De was invited to examine him and said that the illness originates from the liver and appears on the skin. It will not be easy to achieve results without a change of scenery for treatment in a short time. Jishen has devoted himself to the party and the country, but he cannot make up for his difficulties, and he is plagued by the disease demon. What can I say? I have to submit a report to the National Government immediately, requesting to be removed from all concurrent positions and return to my hometown to recuperate in peace. I respectfully report this. I will continue to report the rest. Li Jishen respectfully seals."</p>

<p>The Standing Committee Meeting of the Association for the Abolition of Civil War Resolved to Announce Non-Cooperation with Liu Xiang</p>
<h3 id="e88">Telegraphic Petition from Representatives to the Third Plenary Session Requesting Central Government to Severely Punish Liu Xiang <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The General Association for the Abolition of Internal Warfare held its third executive committee meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM. Thirty-seven executive committee members attended. Wang Xiaolai was unanimously elected as temporary chairman, and Gu Huaibing served as secretary. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>(Executive Committee Members Present) Qian Xinzhi, Wu Daquan, (Qian Xinzhi substituting for) Du Yuesheng, Lu Runquan, Pu Xinya, (Lu Runquan substituting for) Wang Xiaolai, Jin Runquan, Song Yuting, (Wang Xiaolai substituting for) Chen Liting, Zhou Zuomin, (Chen Liting substituting for), Chen Peide, Leng Zhanqi, (Qi Yunqing substituting for) Yang Meizhen, Li Gongpu, Hu Shuhua, Fu Yueqi, (Hu Shuhua substituting for) Li Denghui, Bei Songsun, Liu Shimu, Wang Yansong, Lin Kanghou, Yu Xiaochuan, Xu Huaiqing, Wang Yiling, Li Kuian, (Lin Kanghou substituting for) Yan Esheng, Yu Rongqiao, Lin Junbao, (Yan Esheng substituting for) Liu Zhanen, Chen Shi, Ma Wenhui, (Liu Zhanen substituting for) Xu Jilou, Chen Zhezheng, (Xu Jilou substituting for) Lu Zhangyuan, Yu Dichen, Zhou Xuexiang, Zhu Xuefan</p>
<p>(Meeting Proceedings) At 2:30 PM, the number of executive committee members present reached the legal quorum, and the meeting was declared open. The temporary chairman respectfully read the will of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, followed by a report on the number of attendees. Next, Secretary-General Yan Esheng reported on the telegram from Mr. Yu Rizhang from Geneva and on the association's work. In addition to distributing printed materials, he detailed the achievements since the association's founding and the anti-internal warfare movement in Sichuan Province. Subsequently, Xu Jilou, representing treasurer Chen Zhezheng, reported on the association's income and expenditures, and distributed financial reports. The temporary chairman then reported on the progress of contacting and organizing branch associations in Wuhan. Yan Esheng, representing Bao Ling, reported on the establishment and work of the Tianjin branch association. Hu Shuhua reported on the methods for organizing branch associations in Hunan Province. After the reports, the discussion of proposals began.</p>
<p>(Work Achievements) Secretary-General Yan Esheng reported on the work achievements, stating: "The association was formally established only three months ago, and branch associations have not yet been widely established in various locations. The number of members has also not reached the maximum. With an organization that is not yet fully sound, we have taken on the arduous task of abolishing internal warfare. Furthermore, we encountered the Shandong Incident, followed by internal warfare in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. I am ashamed that we have not been able to achieve our ideal and satisfactory goal of eliminating and preventing these conflicts, and that we have failed to live up to the expectations of the people of the country. However, arduous tasks cannot be accomplished overnight, and effective methods require collective efforts. Although the association's past work has not had a significant practical effect, it has had a substantial spiritual impact. Acting Premier Song Ziwen's speech on November 6th indicated that outstanding individuals in the country have organized the 'General Association for the Abolition of Internal Warfare,' and its influence is growing stronger daily, soon becoming an important force in abolishing the use of force to resolve political issues." This speech has been widely reported in foreign newspapers, and can greatly attract international attention. Regarding the recently concluded Shandong Han-Liu conflict, Mr. Zhang Boling, a member of this association's executive committee, reported from Shanghai that the fact that the conflict was not extremely fierce was partly due to the repeated dissuasion by this association. As for the Sichuan conflict, this association received reports from Sichuanese people in Shanghai in September of this year, stating that Chengdu and Chongqing were making military movements and that unfortunate events were likely to occur. They requested that measures be taken to eliminate the conflict. Considering the pressing national crisis, how could internal strife be tolerated, this association immediately telegraphed Liu Wenhui in Chengdu and Liu Xiang in Chongqing, requesting them to reply swiftly to reassure the people. At the same time, we telegraphed the chambers of commerce in Chengdu and Chongqing to inquire about the truth and to eliminate the conflict as appropriate. Subsequently, we received a telegram from Liu Wenhui stating, "We are preoccupied with resisting foreign aggression and cannot bear to speak of private fights. Wenhui is internally seeking cooperation and is willing to yield to others. This has always been my intention, and God is my witness. Even if people do not conspire with me, I will strive to avoid conflict. While I can compromise, I will never initiate conflict," and so on. We also received a telegram from Liu Xiang stating, "The officers and soldiers in Sichuan are thinking of sharpening their swords and preparing their horses to support the government's diplomacy. How can they kill each other and lightly start war? The military actions you inquired about are all under my command. The so-called 'idle talk' may not satisfy everyone's hearts, but it intends to provoke discord," and so on. In early October, due to more urgent rumors, this association telegraphed both sides again, urging them to quickly order their troops not to act rashly. Soon after sending the telegram, we received a reply telegram from Liu Wenhui stating that he would "not hesitate to make every effort to resolve the dispute internally, hoping that those who cause chaos will realize their mistakes, so as not to betray the sincere teachings," and so on. However, there was no reply from Liu Xiang. Before long, the Sichuan war broke out. This association repeatedly tried to stop it, but to no avail. On November 23, we received another telegram from Liu Wenhui, stating the process of his retreat, voluntarily giving up defenses in various places, hoping for the vindication of justice and a quick resolution of the dispute. This association then telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Administration of the National Government again, requesting them to strictly order the generals on all sides to strictly order their subordinates to abide by the National Government's order to cease fire immediately, and to ask Liu Xiang to express his agreement with the peaceful proposition and jointly plan concrete measures to resolve the dispute and reorganize Sichuan's administration. After the telegram was sent, we received a reply from the Military Affairs Commission stating that the resolution of the Sichuan war was being planned, but we still did not receive any response from Liu Xiang. Recent news reports indicate that Liu Xiang still plans to launch a general offensive against Liu Wenhui at a fixed time, which shows where the failure to stop the Sichuan war lies. Furthermore, as reported by the local newspapers, a telegram from Chengdu on November 2 stated that students from Rongchang Municipal Elementary School formed an anti-war propaganda team and went to various villages to spread their message. Yesterday, at Wanbao Fang, seven people were arrested by Battalion Commander Huang of Wang Zanxu's troops of the Chongqing army and sent to the command headquarters. The leading student, Shen Xuanheng, was accused of inciting the troops and was immediately executed. The others are under interrogation. Not only that, but a Chongqing telegram on December 2 reported that the Xinshu Daily was sealed by the Garrison Command for publishing the National Government's order to cease fire. Later, due to the intercession of a certain important person, the person in charge of the newspaper wrote a letter of repentance and the matter was settled. This shows that Liu Xiang not only suppressed the people's anti-internal warfare movement, but also defied the National Government's cease-fire order. A Chongqing telegram on the same day stated that Lan Wenbin, a brigade commander of the 21st Army, was detained for 20 days for opposing the war. On the morning of December 1, Liu Xiang telegraphed the military headquarters to have Lan executed by firing squad. Another telegram stated that the Chongqing business community's opposition to the third phase of financial bonds was expanding. Yutong Bank, whose capital was known to be strong, was closed by the authorities, and the manager was detained in the Garrison Command. The bank's cash was confiscated. More than a dozen small money shops and foreign goods stores in Chongqing were affected and closed down, and cries of distress were heard everywhere. Article 2, Section 3 of this association's charter stipulates that if internal warfare unfortunately occurs, the association's member organizations and individual members should unanimously refuse to cooperate and should adopt peaceful and appropriate methods to stop it. Therefore, when the Sichuan war was raging, the Sichuan branch of this association was established in Chongqing on October 16, and issued a public statement, clearly stating that it would not comply with any conscription. Prior to this, the Chongqing Municipal Department and Association also replied to the initial telegram from this association inquiring about the situation in Sichuan, stating, "At this time of crisis, we must revitalize the spirit of the anti-internal warfare movement. We must refuse to comply with any conscription, except for the usual regular supplies." Therefore, the Chongqing business community's refusal to purchase the third phase of financial bonds is not unconnected to this association's spirit of non-cooperation with those who wage internal warfare. At the same time, the Chengdu Chamber of Commerce replied to this association's telegram on October 10, stating, "Rather than lingering in a dying state, it is better to cut off the root of the problem. We will lead hundreds of thousands of merchants in the city to follow behind." Currently, various groups in Chengdu have organized the People's Anti-War Alliance to support peace and stop the chaotic war. The Chengdu Chamber of Commerce has also issued a declaration requesting the complete withdrawal of troops from the city. If this goal is not achieved, they will resist by striking to achieve their goals. The Sichuan branch of this association, as well as the business community, financial community, academia, and other people's organizations in Chengdu and Chongqing, are all willing to sacrifice everything to oppose internal warfare. This spirit and courage are truly admirable."</p>
<p>(Resolutions) ㈠ Discussing the proposal to petition the Third Plenary Session to stop internal warfare and unite against foreign aggression: The Third Plenary Session is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 15th of this month. This association should petition the plenary session to resolve to stop internal warfare and unite against foreign aggression to save the country. Is this appropriate? Please decide. Resolution: Passed. Pu Yangshan, Liu Zhanen, and Lin Kanghou were unanimously elected as representatives to present the petition. ㈡ Discussing the proposal to universally solicit members: To strengthen the association's power, it is necessary to universally solicit members. Members from all sectors, including agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia, are welcome to join. In particular, we hope that former officers and personnel who have served in the military and political fields will join this association to guide our work and to express their determination not to participate in internal warfare in the future. Is this appropriate? Please decide. ㈢ Discussing the proposal for chambers of commerce in provinces and cities to organize anti-internal warfare committees before branch associations are established: According to the regulations of this association, the organization of branch associations should be handled by representatives from local legal organizations. However, the procedures cannot be completed in a short time, and we must strive for thoroughness in the process. Before branch associations are established in various places, should chambers of commerce first establish anti-internal warfare committees within their associations to communicate and facilitate progress? Is this appropriate? Please decide. The above two proposals were discussed together. Resolution: A telegram will be sent to chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities to organize anti-internal warfare committees, to universally solicit members in accordance with the association's purpose, and then to plan the organization of branch associations. ㈣ Discussing the Sichuan internal warfare case: The two main parties involved in the Sichuan war are Liu Wenhui and Liu Xiang. Liu Wenhui has already issued a statement declaring his retreat and expressing his willingness to cease fire. This association has also telegraphed Liu Xiang, requesting him to comply with the central government's order and quickly cease fire, but we have not yet received a reply. What further actions should this association take to effectively stop the war? Please decide. Resolution: (A) Announce Liu Xiang's violation of the National Government's order, continuing internal warfare, closing newspapers and banks, and committing the crimes of executing Lan Wenbin, a brigade commander who opposed internal warfare, and Shen Xuanheng, a student at Rongchang Municipal Elementary School.

(D) Send a telegram to the entire country to not cooperate with Liu Xiang. ㈤ Discussing the Guizhou internal warfare case: This association telegraphed the Guiyang County Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the details of the Guizhou internal warfare and to eliminate the conflict as appropriate, but we have not yet received a reply. How should we plan methods to stop the conflict? Please decide. Resolution: Send a telegram urging the Guiyang County Chamber of Commerce to reply quickly, and unite with Guizhou people in Shanghai to plan effective methods to stop the conflict. ㈥ Discussing effective and proactive methods to abolish internal warfare: The steps this association takes to abolish internal warfare are: first, persuasion; second, sending representatives to mediate; and third, non-cooperation. However, based on past experience, the first two steps, while not completely ineffective, have yielded very little. How should the third step be implemented, and are there any other effective methods? Please decide. Resolution: Implement non-cooperation with those who wage internal warfare, and expand publicity. ㈦ Discussing the budget: The expenditure budget approved by the second executive committee meeting was for a three-month trial period.

<h3 id="e95">Requesting an Appeal by Telegram <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(Omitted above) To the Chinese Delegation in Geneva: During the anti-Japanese resistance in Shanghai, the 50th Boy Scout Corps of China (Troop Fifty Boy Scouts of China), organized by this association, dispatched four Boy Scouts, Luo Yunxiang, Bao Zhengwu, Mao Weixiang, and Ying Wenda, wearing red cross armbands, to go deep into the war zone with members of the Red Cross Society to rescue the suffering people. However, they were captured by the Japanese army. Refugees who escaped and were acquainted with the four corps members reported that they had seen them being tied up by the Japanese awaiting execution. After the efforts of the Public Concession Bureau and consuls of various countries to rescue them, the Japanese initially prevaricated, and then claimed that there were no such people, as they had already been killed, their bodies destroyed, and the evidence erased, the same as the Cai Gongshi case of the previous year, after which they made excuses. Now, at the time of the League of Nations meeting, we are using this to present the Japanese's disregard for international law to the world, hoping that it will receive the same attention as the recent massacre of civilians in Fushun. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Declaration of the Assembly <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The declaration of the memorial service for the four martyred Boy Scouts of Songhu states: After the January 28th battle, the history of Chinese Boy Scouts has a more glorious and moving page. The fact is that the cruel and war-loving Japan was coveting the fertile Northeast and, under the pretext of self-defense, forcibly occupied it. Not satisfied with that, it sent barbaric troops to ravage Shanghai. Its intention was nothing more than to divert the world's attention, in order to secretly complete the preliminary plan of its decades-long conspiracy: to establish a puppet state. The loyal 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, etc., in order to uphold human justice and seek the survival of the nation, disregarded everything and rose up to resist. At the same time, our Boy Scouts, seeing countless compatriots being innocently massacred, driven by a sense of responsibility, and based on the second article of the Boy Scout Oath: to help others at all times and serve the public, abandoned their personal careers and families and quickly organized a battlefield service group, assisting the Red Cross, risking life and limb in the midst of gunfire and bullets, and saving the lives of many suffering compatriots. Unfortunately, the four comrades of the 50th Corps, Luo Yunxiang, Ying Wenda, Bao Zhengwu, and Mao Weixiang, were thus captured and cruelly murdered by the Japanese invaders under the false accusation of being spies. The loyal remains have not yet been found. A Boy Scout without political colors, with the aim of seeking world peace, wearing the symbol of the Red Cross, which is not allowed to be hated by international law, was actually cruelly murdered. This is unprecedented. From this, it can be seen that the brutal Japan is not only the enemy of the Chinese people, but also the public enemy of all countries in the world. If world justice is to exist, then we must attack the Japanese people. Originally, the economies of various countries were struggling and unable to take care of their own affairs. How could they have the leisure to care about other people's affairs? After all, we are Chinese people, and we are interdependent. Therefore, the final victory still depends on self-reliance, self-encouragement, and striving to struggle. We must not shout slogans and whistle on paper, doing things that are useless in practice. Although the situation in Shanghai seems to have passed, with singing, dancing, and nightlife continuing, the ashes of the war zone are still exposed and have not been erased. The Northeast Volunteer Army is still using old weapons and wearing thin clothes, continuing the anti-Japanese work in the frozen wilderness. Therefore, our greatest task at present is to carry on the legacy of the martyrs, avenge the shame, and save the country. Even if we cannot hold a gun and go to the front line, we must at least do some work to help the wounded and save the dying, and serve humanity. We must carry forward the resolute spirit of the Boy Scouts. Wherever our duty lies, we will not hesitate to die. We feel deeply ashamed for living after the four comrades who died for their country. In addition to finding ways to provide compensation for the families of the martyrs, the 50th Corps has applied to the organizing agency, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, to build a memorial tower to commend the righteous army. In the future, it will be decided to build a cenotaph in the central area of Shanghai to ensure immortality. On the one hand, it can prevent the souls of the martyrs from having no place to rest, and on the other hand, it can give future generations admiration. Now, under the order of the General Association of Boy Scouts of China, the Shanghai Special Municipality Boy Scout Council is holding this grand memorial service. We are very grateful for the elegiac couplets and eulogies given by all walks of life. In the future, not only our Boy Scouts must always identify their goals and work hard, but we also hope that people from all walks of life will give us deeper sympathy and assistance, so that the legacy of the four martyrs can be extended, the great enemy of mankind can be eliminated, the nation can be saved from danger, and the world can achieve equality. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<p>The 93-year-old Ma Xiangbo Advocated Raising Voluntary Donations for Righteous Soldiers</p>
<h3 id="e97">One Copper Coin Per Person Per Day <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Ma Xiangbo, a ninety-three-year-old elder, expressed his views to a reporter from the New Voice Society yesterday on assisting the Northeast Volunteer Army, saying: Recent news indicates that General Su Bingwen led his troops to seek refuge in Russian territory. Japan regards this as a national criminal matter and demands extradition, viewing the three eastern provinces as the Emperor's land and not belonging to China. On one hand, they falsely claim popular will to establish a nation under Japanese supervision and management, attempting to deceive the world. On the other hand, they arbitrarily slaughter our compatriots, not valuing them as much as chickens or dogs. This is intolerable! How can this be tolerated? This is not treating our 470 million compatriots as human beings. Once they slaughter 470 million chickens and dogs, even humanity might find it unbearable. Therefore, in addition to various public donations and monthly contributions, I propose initiating a fundraising campaign for the Chinese Volunteer Donation, one copper coin per person per day, aiming to make our 470 million compatriots, who are suffering this unprecedented great shame and humiliation, feel ashamed and rise up, never forgetting day by day. Those who rise up are helped by Heaven, and those who feel ashamed are blessed by Heaven. What is most heartbreaking is that some countrymen are still killing each other, openly assisting the enemy, and others are passively watching the killings, secretly assisting the enemy. For the present plan, our people should only ask their conscience, protect their integrity, fulfill their national duty donation, and fulfill their national crisis special donation. Let me elaborate: The national duty donation means that among the 470 million citizens, deducting 70 million who are fighting and those who have been injured or disabled, there are still 400 million compatriots who contribute one copper coin per day, 360 copper coins per year, which is equivalent to one silver dollar. Even beggars can do it. This means that 400 million silver dollars can be donated in one year, which is more than 33 million silver dollars per month. It seems to be better than other donations that have no fixed amount or period, and its significance is more sufficient to awaken compatriots to be vigilant every day. One copper coin, one share, is the minimum requirement. What is the national crisis special donation? In this time of man-made disasters and natural calamities, the so-called imperialist conquest ideology treats our people as less than chickens and dogs. We must be insulted before others insult us, so we should save on luxury to supplement the insufficiency of the mandatory donations. The main items for saving are as follows: 1. Entertainment donation, referring to automatic donations of a certain amount in entertainment venues, or the method of levying entertainment tax can also be adopted. 2. Anti-drug donation, referring to eating one or two fewer simple meals every day, which benefits both people and oneself. Even a big [something is missing], why not do it? 3. Luxury donation, referring to using one less box or bottle of perfume and cologne per month, and wearing one less piece of Stanco foreign clothing. 4. Savings donation, referring to ordering one or two fewer dishes or eating one or two less items at home or when entertaining guests. 5. Tobacco and alcohol donation, referring to smoking one or two fewer cigarettes or drinking one or two fewer sips of foreign wine and sorghum liquor. 6. Buddhist donation, referring to doing merit deeds, such as burning incense and lighting candles on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, and burning incense and chanting Buddha in various temples, burning one less bundle of incense, lighting one less pair of candles, preparing one less vegetarian meal, and burning one less knife of tin foil. These kinds of righteous donations are truly great compassion, rescuing from suffering and difficulties. 7. Sutra and repentance donation, referring to performing one less ritual or reducing the scale of Taoist ceremonies, communal feasts, offering food to hungry ghosts, suppressing disasters, repenting before Buddha, and worshipping the stars every year, and using the savings for righteous donations, which will surely cultivate blessings, longevity, children, and grandchildren. In China, from ancient times to the present, officials take money, and the people give money. Empty-handed, without any achievements, Heaven sees that the people's weakness often leads to survival in hopeless situations, just as the Empress Dowager's tolerance of the Boxers led to the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance, yet our country did not perish. After the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War, Ito Hirobumi was extremely arrogant, but An Jung-geun assassinated him. When he was executed, he said to his younger brother, Jeong-geun, "My country's enemy is also China's enemy. I wish to die for the sake of relations between the two countries and the overall situation in East Asia. I hope the Chinese nation will understand my humble intentions and deeply consider the fate of the two countries to save my 20 million Koreans and 400 million Chinese people from the abyss of misery. I have something to say now: Unless Korean independence is restored, the Chinese nation will have no peace of mind." This prediction, which appeared in the first issue of the New Korean Youth magazine, has now been verified. It must be understood that Japan's invasion of the Northeast is the beginning of the conquest of China and the world, as seen in their memorials. However, Heaven loves life, and if we are willing to feel ashamed and rise up, we will never allow them to devour us. All hope lies in the cooperation of our compatriots in distress. Although the strategy is small, its function is vast. The method of raising funds is to have the leaders of each family, each household, each store, each institution, each group, business association, factory, school, etc., collect and store the funds. The method is to have the banks in each county publicly recommend and designate [someone]. Since this is initiated and donated by the people, it should all be discussed and used by the people, either to open factories to manufacture or to find ways to purchase guns, cannons, and airplanes, vowing not to recover the three northeastern provinces. Rather be shattered like jade than remain whole like tile.</p>
<p>Please Expedite the Resolution of the Outstanding Rent Reduction Case</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Cost of Living Index Has Fallen, but Rent Has Increased. If Administrative Measures Are Not Taken Soon, Businesses Will Be Forced to Liquidate and Close Down. <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>|| Citizen Association Re-Submits Document to the Municipal Party Headquarters ||</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special Zone Citizens' Association previously submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters, urging them to expedite the resolution of the outstanding rent reduction case. The Association received instructions yesterday and immediately submitted another urgent request. The correspondence is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Instructions from the Municipal Party Headquarters <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Received one document: Requesting expedited resolution of rent reduction to maintain commerce. The case was previously submitted to the Central Committee, which instructed the Executive Yuan to dispatch personnel to work with Party and government organs to revise the standard measures for rent reduction. Later, a reply was received from the Central Secretariat, stating that the Executive Yuan had responded to the Municipal Government of this city, stating that the previously established standard measures had been promulgated for a long time, and any easy changes might cause disputes. It is proposed that the Central Committee send personnel to Shanghai for investigation to clarify the truth. The Central Committee was then requested to send personnel to Shanghai to investigate and handle the matter. Please be informed. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Petition from the Citizens' Association <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Petition regarding the imminent end of the year and the need for rapid rent reduction to save businesses from bankruptcy and prevent long-term resistance. We respectfully received instruction No. 227 of the [department] (original text omitted above). According to the index table of Shanghai's cost of living issued by the National Tariff Commission, Volume 8, No. 10, October of the 21st year, the index for food was 122.8 in February and 94.9 in October; the index for clothing was 108.2 in February and 99.0 in October; the index for rent was 107.3 in February and 108.8 in October; the index for fuel was 141.4 in February and 131.7 in October; the index for miscellaneous items was 193.60 in February and 165.2 in October; the total index was 163.4 in February and 113.50 in October. In summary, the above indexes show that the prices of four items have fallen, and the price of food (mainly rice) has fallen the most, while rent has increased instead. This shows that real estate still utilizes semi-patents and has no alternatives, and cannot be arbitrarily abandoned at any time. If rent is not reduced, it will continue to increase. When rice prices rise, officials should immediately issue price limits to alleviate the living difficulties of civilians. If rent is not subject to administrative restrictions in peacetime, it is enough to make shopkeepers deliberately save on essential living expenses to pay for rent. Since the Shanghai turmoil caused by the violent Japanese, Shanghai's commerce has plummeted. Layoffs and salary cuts and [unclear] sales revenue are barely enough to cover rent expenses, and there is often a shortfall. It was originally hoped that rent reduction could be implemented early so that the pressure could be temporarily relieved in the autumn and winter seasons, and donations for rescuing refugees in the Northeast and assisting volunteer armies could be provided by citizens to relieve national crises. The duty must be fulfilled with effort, so the situation is even more strained. Please carefully examine the donations from Shanghai, the number of real estate holders who bear the burden, and what the statistics show. There has been criticism in the people's newspapers that it seems that the country can be lost, the land can be lost, but the rent increase cannot be stopped. If administrative measures are not taken early, there will be no one to supply the needs of long-term resistance. I fear that when the end of the year arrives, businesses will have a tendency to liquidate and close down, which will further increase the serious problem of [something]. It will be too late to remedy the situation at that time. The [Municipal Party Headquarters] is keenly aware of the commercial and industrial situation in Shanghai, and we have already received instructions to re-request the Central Committee, which we dare not repeatedly solicit. However, we are compelled by the need to look ahead and behind. We once again venture to trouble the [Municipal Party Headquarters] and humbly request that you expedite the submission to the Central Committee for instructions to the government to take rapid action to maintain the Shanghai commercial and industrial economy and facilitate long-term resistance. We are sincerely grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Current Situation of Northeast Postal Services <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a postal authority told reporters yesterday that since our three northeastern provinces were occupied by violent Japanese forces, all post offices and staff were withdrawn into the interior due to transportation obstructions. Only 26 post offices remained on both sides of Suifenhe in Jilin Province. The area is close to the Russian border and can be reached by sea via Vladivostok to connect with the provinces under the [Postal Service] Headquarters. As of now, no reports have been received, and there are no unexpected occurrences. As for the area where Su Bingwen's troops were stationed to resist the Japanese, it was in the Greater Khingan Mountains. Transportation was obstructed, so the post office had been withdrawn long ago. After Su's withdrawal, there was no connection with the postal service.</p>
<p>Statements from Financial Circles after E W Eames Defection</p>
<h3 id="e102">Damage to Credit of Foreign Employees in Various Institutions; Ample Reason to Seek Recovery of Pension <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>After local Chinese and foreign newspapers revealed that former Acting Inspector General of Customs E W Eames had accepted the position of customs advisor to the puppet Manchukuo regime, all customs personnel, both Chinese and foreign, expressed indignation. Chinese personnel believed that Eames's actions were ungrateful and disloyal, as he had been supported by China for decades. Foreign personnel believed that Eames's actions were detrimental to the reputation of foreigners and revealed that foreigners serving in the Chinese government lacked loyalty and integrity, which would affect the credibility of foreign employees serving in various institutions in China in the future. Therefore, at a banquet in financial circles the other day, a certain gentleman made a speech. However, the gentleman was a person in financial circles and not a customs officer. The reference to the staff of the Inspectorate General of Customs was a misrepresentation. At the request of the gentleman, a correction is made. After inquiring from various sources about Eames's past, it was confirmed that he had served in the Customs for more than 20 years and held a very high position. Even after the establishment of the National Government, he was promoted to the position of Acting Inspector General of Customs. Later, he retired due to old age and received a pension of more than 100,000 yuan. It was expected that he would retire and enjoy his old age without worrying about his livelihood. Now, he does not know how to cherish himself and relies on the puppet regime, which is a burden on his later years. The pension given by the Chinese government was originally intended for the support of employees after retirement due to old age. Now that Eames does not cherish his old age and willingly defects to the enemy, diplomatic negotiations should be conducted to recover the pension, which is a sufficient reason. Moreover, Eames is now openly active in Geneva as an advisor to the puppet state, which seems to place him in a position contrary to China. Therefore, if the Chinese government formally raises this point, it can also expose his fickleness.</p>

<p>Record of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee Inspecting the Completion of the Dike Project (Continuation 12)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Simpson's Speech <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Simpson, representing the foreign guests present, delivered a speech of thanks, stating: "Today, we are greatly honored to be hosted by Commander-in-Chief Chiang. On behalf of all the foreign guests, male and female, who are participating, I would like to express my gratitude to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Madame Chiang. I am very honored to come to China to participate in the flood relief work. I am most pleased with the relief work. This time, building a 3,000-mile dike and completing such an amazing achievement in the shortest period of time is the first time I have seen it. In the past, the public only knew that the government collected donations and taxes. Since the establishment of the National Government, the public has repeatedly received government relief, as well as this flood relief, which should further enhance their faith in the government. Now Commander-in-Chief Chiang is engaged in rural relief, with detailed plans. Rural finance will soon be fundamentally resolved. I believe that the foreign guests present today are 120,000 percent sympathetic and are very willing to support [us] in the end. Finally, I wish Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Madame Chiang good health."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Chiang's Second Speech <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Chiang stood up again and said: "Today, I am extremely grateful to have Chinese and foreign guests come to provide guidance. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few more words. There is an ancient Chinese saying: 'Floods and wild beasts' are the most harmful to the world's humanity. China is now a country with internal troubles and external threats, especially with the addition of the disaster of floods. Of course, the people suffer great pain, and the country faces endless dangers. Fortunately, enthusiastic patriots and friendly foreigners have in the past run around calling for help and assisting the government. I am extremely grateful and give them 120,000 thanks. I have one sentence to say to you, that is, even though we are in the midst of floods, wild beasts, internal troubles, and external threats, we will definitely be able to fight our way out and open up a path to life, and we will never betray your kindness. Now China is still in a precarious situation. Fortunately, disaster relief and bandit suppression have achieved good results, and the foundation for national salvation has been established. I firmly believe that in a year's time, we will be able to walk on the road to brightness. I especially hope that Chinese and foreign celebrities and people across the country will continue to cooperate with the government to the end to complete the task of saving the country and the people and increasing the happiness of mankind." After Chiang finished speaking, it was already 6 o'clock, and the gathering ended happily.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Banquet by Wuhan Municipal Government <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Hankou Municipal Government hosted a banquet for the Dike Project Inspection Group at the Yan Yip Bank on the second floor at 7:30 pm on the 4th. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng, and the head of the Municipal Government's Secretariat Section all came to greet the guests in person. During the banquet, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying: "I am very pleased to welcome the Dike Project Inspection Group from afar to Hankou. The repair of the Yangtze River dike has been completed, like a Great Wall. I have two thoughts: (1) The completion of this dike depends on foreign investment, American wheat, and the help of foreign talents such as Mr. Simpson, so the achievements are great and the completion is rapid. This point is enough to show that the construction of the new China is extremely in need of foreign capital and foreign talents. As long as foreign capital has no political effect and foreign talents are completely dedicated to China's construction, we are extremely welcome. It is definitely not like some people who promote in Europe that China is anti-foreign and rejects foreign investment. This point can be refuted without attacking. The second point is that the completion of this 3,000-mile dike is enough to show the efforts and concentration of the Chinese people. 1931 was an unfortunate year for the whole world, especially the most unfortunate year for China. We suffered internal floods and external aggression. Even in this difficult environment, the Chinese people are still constantly striving to complete the great dike project. Now that the dike project is completed, we hope to dredge the Yangtze River to avoid suffering from floods in the future. I hope that everyone present will assist in the progress. Otherwise, the dike project cannot be permanently kept safe, just as the Great Wall cannot permanently resist the invasion of the Xiongnu." Next, [something] by</p>
<p>[P Simpson's Reply]</p>
<p>Stating, "During this inspection of the dike project, one shortcoming in Hankou was noted, namely that half a mile of the riverbank in the Japanese concession has not been built with a flood control dike, which is regrettable. If this small section is not built, Hankou's flood control dike is equivalent to a mere formality. I hope the mayor will negotiate with the Japanese side to explain the advantages and disadvantages and complete it according to the plan. In addition, regarding China's hopes, the Chinese people must recognize that everyone is Chinese, and there should be no distinctions between provinces, especially in times of national crisis. All domestic undertakings must cooperate and sacrifice private interests. The future is bright and limitless. We must take Russia, the United States, and Japan as models and unite absolutely and consistently against foreign countries." Finally, Huang Renlin reported to the members of the inspection group that the Dike Project Inspection Group would take the Wan'an wheel westward at 2 pm on the 5th and gather at the Yangtze River Hotel at 12 pm to depart. The banquet ended at about 10 pm.</p>

<p>Labor Dispute at Wuhe Mercerizing Factory Resolved</p>
<h3 id="e109">Both Parties Sign Three Measures; Will Report to the Social Affairs Bureau to Close the Case <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Wuhe Mercerizing and Dyeing Factory at the intersection of Yaozhu Church Road, Xujiahui, dismissed eleven workers, including Tang Fenglin, in July of this year, causing a dispute that has not been resolved after repeated mediation by Party and government agencies according to law. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned [the parties] for questioning the other day, instructing both parties to go out and resolve the dispute amicably. Two measures have been signed and announced to be resolved.</p>
<p>Announcement of Closure: After the labor party submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, and because the manager of the factory, Zhang Shaoshan, was detained in the case, the shareholders declared the closure of the factory because there was no way to operate and the original capital had been almost exhausted, and reported to the Party and government agencies for record. The Mercerizing and Dyeing Workers' Union believed that the factory's sudden closure concerned the livelihood of the workers, and also reported to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting [the bureau] to stop it. On the 8th of this month, the bureau summoned [the parties] for questioning based on the request of both labor and management. The person in charge, Tan Peiyan, advised both parties to compromise and try to resolve the dispute amicably outside. At 10 am yesterday, the factory side designated a shareholder, Niu Shanqing, to meet with Liu Jintai, the executive director of the union, to discuss three measures to resolve the dispute, formally signed [them], and then jointly reported to the Party and government agencies to close the case.</p>
<p>Measures for Resolution: The three measures for resolution signed by both parties yesterday are as follows: (1) The factory side will give each worker a subsidy of 50 yuan; (2) The union will repay 250 yuan for the expenses incurred by the union during the dispute over the dismissal of workers such as Tang Fenglin; (3) When the old shareholders resume business, they must still recruit 15 original member workers. If the factory is sold and opened by non-shareholders, they must do their best to introduce the work, etc.</p>

<p>Reason for Failure to Compare and Measure Rice Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e111">Association Plans to Use Scales <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The rice measures used by the rice industries in the North and South Cities have always used sea measures. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that this old-fashioned measure is no longer applicable and ordered the use of new measuring instruments. The Bean and Rice Public Association manufactured more than 500 [new instruments]. It was originally scheduled to be implemented in February of this year, and the old sea measures were abolished. It was reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. However, after the Shanghai war, the business of each industry was suspended, and the association requested several times to postpone the implementation. It has now been agreed that the new measuring instruments will be used uniformly in the North and South Cities on February 6 of next year. After the comparison is accurate, the various industries will be notified to prepare. Unexpectedly, the South City Measure Department and the boatmen had a dispute over the weight of the rice. Therefore, the association changed to using scales to avoid disputes between the Measure Department and the boatmen over the weight of the rice. The association originally scheduled to hold the winter rice comparison yesterday, so it was stopped.</p>

It was traveling at full speed and did not pull back the whistle, violently hitting the stern of the stone boat. The boat and cargo immediately sank, and the workers fell into the water at the same time. The tugboat drove straight away. Later, they were rescued by another boat. It is reported that the loss is more than 2,000 yuan. The boat owner, Fang Jincai, reported to the Shanghai [something] Stone Lighter Industry Association and transferred it to the Jianghai Customs Marine Department for fair judgment and ordered compensation.

<p>Cattle Industry Association Calls for Lifting of Cattle Ban</p>
<h3 id="e113">Cattle for Plowing Distinguished from Old Cattle: Request for Inspection and Separate Lifting of Prohibition <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Trade Association, concerned about the excessive restrictions on cattle, harming both merchants and farmers, has issued a declaration to fellow tradesmen in various regions stating that since the Jiangsu Province floods last year, authorities, in order to protect agricultural affairs, issued an order prohibiting the export of plowing cattle, with a limit of eight months, from October of last year to the end of May this year, the term is now expired. Due to the January 28th Incident, the Jiangsu Province War Zone Relief Committee again sent a letter to the provincial government to continue the ban. This is the origin and process of the ban on plowing cattle. However, the ban has been prolonged year after year without a definite end date. Tens of thousands of our fellow tradesmen have lost their livelihood due to the ban. The long-term suspension of slaughter and transportation has caused direct and indirect harm to all. The suffering is especially severe for farmers who cannot dispose of their old cattle. It is found that cattle are divided into plowing cattle and old cattle. The ban should have a definite distinction. Cattle with two to four teeth are in their prime and suitable for operation and belong to plowing cattle. Cattle with six to eight teeth are in their declining years and are therefore old cattle. This identification is recorded in past official gazettes and publicly recognized by farmers and there is no need to avoid mentioning this. If all types are banned indiscriminately, the farmers' old cattle cannot be disposed of due to the ban and they will inevitably be left to die. Protecting agriculture will actually harm agriculture. Our association has repeatedly appealed to the authorities, requesting a separate lifting of the ban. Subsequently, we received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce approving the War Zone Relief Committee's telegram No. 45, which stated that the Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Trade Association's proposal to identify the age of cattle teeth to determine whether to ban transportation has been sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for joint handling. In accordance with this approval we have recorded the telegram and sent it to you. It is very clear that the age of the cattle should be the basis for identification. Last month, we received a comment from the Ministry of Industry stating that plowing cattle are of great importance to national agriculture and that a comprehensive plan is being formulated to establish appropriate measures. Before the Ministry issues a clear order, the original ban will remain in effect. It seems that the authorities' lifting of the ban is still far off. Since the ban, it has been observed that colluding local thugs and corrupt police openly and brazenly engage in private transportation, which has become increasingly rampant. Evidence from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's cattle inspection reports show little difference from before the ban. It only benefits a small number of private vendors and harms the majority of our fellow tradesmen. Therefore, as long as the ban is not lifted, farmers and merchants will continue to be restricted. In order to uphold the authorities' intention to protect agriculture and to alleviate the crisis for our fellow tradesmen, our association finds it necessary to request an inspection to distinguish plowing cattle from old cattle and lift the ban separately. We will therefore contact fellow tradesmen in various regions to request the authorities to devise a rescue plan, hoping that we will all work together to appeal and urge the authorities to consider the plight of the people of Jiangsu. This would not only be the good fortune of tens of thousands of endangered fellow tradesmen in Jiangsu Province, but also the great hope of farmers. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<p>Preserved Meat and Ham Industry Requests Postponement of Inspection Implementation</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau previously planned to implement meat inspection for entry into the city. The Preserved Meat and Ham Trade Associations have repeatedly requested its cancellation, but have not been granted approval. Recently, the Health Bureau also scheduled the implementation of inspection measures to begin on the 16th of this month. Both associations expressed their disagreement with this measure and therefore designated representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and other agencies. Yesterday, they also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to forward a letter to the Health Bureau to temporarily postpone the implementation.</p>
<p>Wuxi Woman Yu Xiuju Accuses National Salvation Association Standing Committee Member Li Yongxiang</p>
<h3 id="e115">Accusation of Seduction and Abandonment <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Former Standing Committee member of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, Li Yongxiang, has recently been accused by Yu Xiuju, a woman from Wuxi residing at No. 18, Qunshou Lane, Baike Road, who hired lawyer Zhang Li, to file a complaint with the First Special District Court accusing him of seduction and abandonment. The cause of the lawsuit is roughly stated as follows: The plaintiff is originally from Wuxi and came to Shanghai to make a living. During the January 28th Incident when the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, she met the defendant at the Shenzhou Hotel on Simalu. They fell in love at first sight and vowed to be together for life. According to her claim, the defendant, currently a committee member of a certain association, whose home still lacks a wife, said, "If you can take care of me, the joy of companionship will be complete." The plaintiff, coming from the countryside, was deceived by his sweet words and believed them to be true, thus losing her virginity. Subsequently, they spent several months together in the Shenzhou and Xiangbin Hotels. Later, she became pregnant and repeatedly urged him to marry her. The defendant initially made and then changed his promises. Later, he rented No. 18, Qunshou Lane, Baike Road for them to live together, but never held a wedding ceremony. The plaintiff knew that something was wrong and insisted repeatedly. The defendant, knowing that he could no longer hide the truth, simply disappeared. After inquiring everywhere, she learned that the defendant not only had a wife, but also had a new lover and was keeping her in a gilded cage. He treated the plaintiff like worn-out shoes. Such deception of women, arbitrary seduction, and abandonment is not only unacceptable to human sentiment but also constitutes a crime under Article 244 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, she begs the court to punish him according to the law and to order the defendant to pay alimony of 20,000 yuan in one lump sum and future child support of 5,000 yuan, for the sake of both public morals and personal convenience. After receiving the complaint, the court has scheduled a hearing for the 17th of this month to summon both parties for a hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Discussion Results of Ms. Zhang Yunqiu's Questions <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Zhang Yunqiu originally raised the questions: 1. Why does the boiling point of love for countless couples drop to zero? 2. What methods can be used to remedy such a tragedy?</p>
<p>Summary of the discussion: We believe that the questions raised by Ms. Zhang are actually a social problem closely related to the current social system. Before the entire social system is reformed and the entire social problem is resolved, this kind of local problem cannot be completely resolved. Even if it can, it is only a "treating the foot when it hurts" or "treating the head when it aches" approach. Even if the medicine you prescribe can accidentally heal one foot or one head, it is not enough to prove that the medicine you prescribe is a miraculous cure for all feet and all heads.</p>
<p>What exactly is the reason why the love of a couple drops from boiling point to freezing point? Many letters reply that it is because men are fond of the new and tired of the old, because they fail to understand the true meaning of love, because of the oppression of married life, because women are economically dependent, because the two parties fail to understand each other deeply. Some people also use the analogy of "too much honey is not sweet" and "the spring of a clock loosens after running for a long time," believing that the relaxation of marital love is inevitable and natural. The various opinions mentioned above are of course all very correct, but they do not grasp the core of the problem and do not find the real root cause. What is said above is only the "fruit," and we should further investigate the source of those "fruits."</p>
<p>Perhaps some people disagree with this opinion! Then I must ask: Why are women economically dependent? Why should a certain group of people feel the oppression of life? Why are men allowed to be fond of the new and tired of the old? If you do not find a root cause, then can you correctly answer these questions except by using something like "the theory of destiny" or "extreme idealism" to explain them tyrannically?</p>
<p>···········································</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the system of private property and men became the center of society, women have been transformed from "free people" to disguised slaves, disguised property. She is only a man's "wife," not a "social person." In other words, she is "a man's," not "society's." She has no freedom, no will. She cannot stand on an equal footing with men. Her daily life and diet all depend on men. Therefore, men can "cherish the new and abandon the old," can "think of moving" when they see "difference," and can use their own likes and dislikes to determine the fate of women. || If we want to explain the first problem psychologically, we should base it on this observation to understand and distinguish it.</p>
<p>Secondly, if we say that the decline of a couple's feelings is due to "the compulsion of life," it is especially clear that this fact is intimately linked to the social system. If everyone in this society works and everyone has food to eat, as in the final stage of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People society, then there would be no fact that some people alone feel the compulsion of life, and there would be no tragedy between husband and wife caused by this. Therefore, to explain this problem from this point of view, we should especially correctly grasp the concept.</p>
<p>However, we are ultimately people in a real society. The reform of society is not something that can be realized in a moment, so we cannot but do our best to remedy the tragedies before us. Even if we treat the head when it aches and treat the foot when it hurts, it is not a happy thing if we can accidentally heal one foot or one head.</p>
<p>Here, we summarize the opinions of more than 300 letters and create a remedy plan as follows:</p>
<p>1. Before marriage, the two parties must understand each other deeply; 2. The two parties should be based on reason and should not be purely emotional; 3. The two parties must respect each other's personality and should not take a playful attitude; 4. The two parties should seek economic independence and be thrifty; 5. The two parties should pay attention to physiological health; 6. The two parties should forgive each other and often recall past love; 7. If possible, small separations should be made frequently; 8. If absolutely incompatible, divorce should be implemented.</p>

<p>At 11:30 last night, the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station suddenly received a strange telephone call. The caller's voice was very rushed, repeatedly asking if it was the police station. The police station replied that it was and asked where they were calling from. The caller only answered the words "French Concession."

<p>Chen Xinzhai, a Shaonan person who performed diabolo at the Yong'an Company's Dayun Building, and his concubine Chen Lu, lived together at No. 12, Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road. They repeatedly led their four adopted daughters and a black dog to perform human-dog intercourse at major hotels within the concession, only caring about profit and disregarding morality. The matter was investigated and confirmed to be true by Hua Detective Tang Jianbao and Detective Yang Fusheng of the Xinzha Police Station. They considered Chen et al. to be corrupting public morals and lacking humanity, and arrested Chen and his wife, as well as their four adopted daughters, including Chen Shuanglin, and the black dog, and brought them to the police station. After questioning, the First Special District Court sentenced Chen Xinzhai to ten years in prison and fined him 300 yuan. Chen Lu was sentenced to ten years in prison and fined 200 yuan. Chen et al. refused to accept the verdict and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. The various circumstances of the Second Branch of the High Court's summons of witnesses and cross-examination have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the date for the verdict in this case arrived. Police lawyer Li Zhishan and appeal agent lawyer Gan Lin arrived on time. Judge Yu Hua, accompanied by assessors Zhao and Guo, took their seats and announced the verdict, the main text of which stated, "Appeal rejected." Upon hearing the verdict, Chen and his wife wept in each other's arms. Judge Yu then instructed that if they did not accept the verdict, they could appeal to the Supreme Court. They were then taken down by bailiffs and sent to prison to serve their sentences.</p>

<p>Small Knotted Hat and Red Paper Package as Identification</p>
<p>Detectives Went as Agreed and Arrested Two People</p>
<p>Huang Zhangfa, a Cantonese man residing at No. 2, Baole'an Road, is in the gold exchange business. Between October 27th and November 22nd, he received as many as five threatening letters delivered by bandits, demanding extortion of 30,000 yuan. They agreed to meet at around 2:00 pm this afternoon near the Yingji Hotel at the corner of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road. The person coming must wear a small knotted hat and hold a red paper package as a sign, otherwise, they will use drastic measures to set his house on fire. The Dithaway Road Police Station dispatched Hua Detective Mao Yiwen, in conjunction with Chinese and foreign detectives and Huang's representative Cen Rukai, to go in the attire specified in the letter. They arrested two men, Lu Jiangshun and Liu Ruiyan, from Tongzhou, and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday, assessor Zhao Linyu specially opened Criminal Court No. 8 to examine the case. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the main culprit could not be found during the adjournment, but the plaintiff and witnesses were all present in court. The threatening letters were presented for inspection. According to Huang Zhangfa's statement, he reported to the police station for protection every time he received the above letters. He had never met the two defendants. According to Cen Rukai, the plaintiff is his brother-in-law. The first time he went to Datong Road, Baike Road, etc. to make contact, he waited for a long time, but no one came to talk. The second time, he went to Fujian Road with the Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station and waited near the entrance of the Yingji Hotel. Shortly after, the two defendants arrived, and the second defendant, Liu Ruiyan, said that it was inconvenient to talk here and asked to go to the Great World Amusement Park to negotiate. They were arrested by the police detectives. When questioned, Lu Jiangshun confessed that he and Liu Ruiyan were formerly cart drivers and later pushed rickshaws. At that time, Liu said that he could introduce him to a place to be a rickshaw driver, and then asked him to go to Fujian Road to pick up a loan. The person wearing a small knotted melon-skin hat and holding a red paper package was the one. He didn't need to be afraid. If the money was obtained, they would each receive 20 yuan as a reward. He heard that the name of the lender was Ah Hong, who was a friend of Liu and lived in a hotel. He knew nothing about the threatening letters or who delivered them. Liu Ruiyan confessed that he knew Ah Hong and that Ah Hong asked him to go to pick up the money and gave him 20 yuan as a reward.

<h3 id="e120">Prevention and Emergency Treatment for Coal Gas Poisoning <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau issued a public notice yesterday, saying, "Citizens, the weather is getting cold and everyone wants to install stoves for heating. Do you still remember the tragedies of people dying from coal gas poisoning in the past? In the past, such tragedies often occurred in places like Beiping. Later, with experience, people knew the prevention and emergency treatment methods. This harm has been reduced a lot. The bureau is now specially explaining it to everyone. 1. Causes of poisoning: When coal balls or coal lumps have not been burned to the extremely flourishing stage, they emit a gas called carbon monoxide. This gas is colorless and odorless, and it is often not easy to detect. If you smell it too much, breathing will become tight, your face will turn red, you will become dizzy, and your mind will become unclear as if you were drunk. If the poisoning is too deep, you will lose your life. Even if it is mild, you will be sick for a few days. 2. Prevention methods: When burning coal or charcoal in a room, be sure to install a chimney or vent pipe. If there is no chimney pipe or vent pipe, you must burn it to the extremely flourishing stage in a place with sufficient outdoor air before moving it indoors. The same should be done when adding coal. Also, when burning coal in the room, you must open one or two of the windows and doors along the empty space to allow the air in the room to circulate and exchange with the outdoor air. It is best not to burn coal or other things while sleeping at night. If you are still burning them, the doors and windows should not be closed tightly and be airtight. In short, when burning things in the room, you must ensure that the outdoor air and the indoor air can circulate and exchange sufficiently. People in the room should also often go outdoors to relax. 3. Emergency treatment for poisoning: If someone is unfortunately poisoned by coal gas, quickly move him to a place with very smooth air, loosen his clothes, and perform artificial respiration. The method is as follows: Loosen the clothes of the poisoned person, make him lie flat, and use pillows or other things to elevate his back to allow his lungs to open. Stand behind his head, slowly lift the poisoned person's arms from the front, extend them over his head, and then slowly lower them to both sides of his body and gently press them flat. Repeat this until the poisoned person wakes up. After waking up, you still need to seek medical treatment to restore your health. Otherwise, the root of the disease will be lurking, and you must be careful. It is best to seek emergency treatment while quickly asking a Western doctor to diagnose. The above is very common knowledge. Because some people still do not understand, there are often tragic news of people dying from coal gas poisoning. With this notice, I hope everyone will pay attention at all times and not be careless. This is a special notice.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Wu Xingsheng Died from Electric Shock Fall <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Wu Xingsheng, a local, 21 years old, was a plasterer. A few days ago, he was working at a height of about 30 feet in the China Aluminum Products Factory at No. 1550 Meizhou Road, Hudong. At 10:30 am, he accidentally touched a power line and fell down, suffering severe head injuries. The factory reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, which ordered Detective Liu to investigate. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after. The body was taken to the Pei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday, Prosecutor Guo, appointed by the First Special District Court, and forensic scribe Wang Zuxing, etc., arrived at the morgue to examine the body and investigate the case. According to Yao Genzong's statement, he was a plasterer and was working in the same place as the deceased that day. He climbed to a high place first. At that time, the power switch had not been turned on, so although he touched the power line, he did not get an electric shock. However, the deceased was climbing up when the power switch was suddenly turned on, causing him to be electrocuted and fall down. The power switch was turned on by Liu Shaofu in the factory. He did not know that Yao and the deceased were working at the time, which caused the accident. After obtaining the confession, Prosecutor Guo ordered that the body of the deceased Wu Xingsheng, male, was indeed injured in the head before death. The body was handed over to his father, Wu Shengsong, to take back for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e133">The Eastern Telegram of the Wenzhou-Chuzhou Salt Affairs Improvement Association <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Wenzhou-Chuzhou Salt Affairs Improvement Association sent a telegram to the chambers of commerce of the Yongjia and the Liang counties of the Wenzhou-Chuzhou areas, saying: Each chamber of commerce forwarded to each group is aware that the salt tax contractors in Wenzhou-Chuzhou have been disrupting for many years. The people of the Association have seen the evils with their own eyes and dare not remain silent. We have collected evidence to sue and deployed to eliminate the fierce and protect the people. In recent months, such as controlling the removal of the Inspector-General Bureau and canceling the contractor system, recovering excess charges, and banning unlicensed transportation, all have been realized. In the case of no fraud, the court recently announced the sentence of detention and fines. The Association's proposal of 19 have been fulfilled. Although this is due to the court's clear investigation and judgment, the Yongjia Salt Affairs Improvement Association's efforts and struggles have contributed greatly to this success. Now, at the beginning of the rectification, old habits still exist. The most important thing to pay attention to is the revision of the salt tax regulations in the two counties. The deployment has been decided and promulgated, and all fees set by the contractors have been abolished. However, it is feared that those in remote rural areas may not be well-informed and that the villagers may be easily deceived. Therefore, we specifically state the total amount of the total number of regulated tax: The Taizhou in Chuzhou, the Jin Yongwu salts and the soy sauce salts in Wenzhou are all set at 4.1 yuan. The villages in Yongjia are all set at.</p>
<p>Yongjia, Xiaoyi townships, are all set at $3.35. Ruian, Pingyang, and Yueqing are set at $2.90. Yongjia, Ruian, and Pingyang, near the sea, are all set at $1.60. Yueqing Yuhuan light tax is set at $1.20. is set at 1 yuan for salt, All surtaxes are already included. There are no other donations or fees. We hope to spread this information widely so that everyone is aware. If there are contractors whose poisons have not been eliminated or any events that should be innovated, we dare to hope that you will clearly inform us by letter. The Association will naturally file a complaint and deploy to complete the improvement, so that the people of the two counties can receive practical benefits.

<p>To the Editor: Regarding your newspaper's report on November 26th that our company privately installed wireless telephone equipment for direct communication with Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou, etc., which impairs China's telecommunications sovereignty, this is inconsistent with the facts. Our company entered into a contract with the Macau government on October 29th, agreeing that our company would supply and install a 500-watt broadcasting station. There was no agreement or intention for international wireless telephone communication. Our company is only engaged in the manufacture and sale of machinery. We have no intention of privately establishing wireless telephone stations with Shanghai, Guangzhou, or any part of the Ministry of Communications. How can this impair China's telecommunications sovereignty? In addition to sending a special letter to the International Telecommunications Bureau and the Ministry of Communications, we are writing to your newspaper to clarify this. We hope you will make a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Asia Electric Company, December 9th.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Important News: Jiangsu Education Commissioner Zhou Fo Hai Inspects Northern Jiangsu (6) <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Braving Wind and Rain to Rugao</p>
<p>Whole City Warmly Welcomes</p>
<p>The situation of Jiangsu Education Commissioner Zhou Fohai's inspection in Nantong and his trip to Shanghai and Beijing was reported yesterday. Now, we supplement the record of Zhou's situation in Rugao. On the morning of the 5th, at 8:00 AM, he attended the anniversary week of the Provincial Tongzhong School and gave an extremely sincere speech to the students. The general idea was that provincial schools are the focus of attention for county, public, and private schools, so expectations are high and supervision is strict. He was very pleased that the students of Tongzhong were able to strive in their studies, but there were two points to note: first, pay attention to physical education; second, strictly observe order. Normal school students will be future teachers and should pay attention to this. Teachers and staff should train students with a strict approach, otherwise both teachers and students will regret it later. In the afternoon of the same day, at 2:00 PM, braving wind and rain, he took a car to Rugao. He arrived in Rugao at 5:00 PM. County Magistrate Qian, representatives of the county party headquarters, standing committee members, Director of Education Bureau Sha, the three directors of the Finance, Construction, and Public Security Bureaus, and representatives of various agencies and organizations were all waiting at the station to welcome him. High-hanging welcome banners were displayed at the station. Zhou got out of the car amidst the sounds of military music and met with the welcomers one by one. Then, he switched to a rickshaw and went to Guangxu Building to rest. All the shops along the way hung flags to express their warm welcome. Welcome slogans were posted all over the streets and alleys. After a short rest, Zhou immediately led Section Chiefs Chen and Xiang, Supervisor Cao, Director Yi, and others to the Provincial Rugao Normal School to inspect self-study. He examined the students one by one in detail and inquired about the daily teaching of the staff and the actual situation of students' extracurricular activities. On the morning of the 6th, he went to Rugao Normal School again to inspect teaching and gave serious criticisms and guidance. Representatives of the Rugao Education Association came to visit. Zhou gave a comprehensive and concise instruction on local education. Then, he went to inspect the affiliated primary school of Rugao Normal School. He gave detailed instructions on the staffing of the school. Then, he went to inspect the County Experimental Elementary School. The school's children were full of "Welcome Education Commissioner Zhou" slogans, which were colorful and dazzling. Children took off their hats to salute Zhou, one after another, full of innocent and unrestrained air. Afterwards, he went to inspect the County People's Education Center for a week. By then it was noon, so he returned to his residence for lunch. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, he went to the Wu Xiang Primary School, the Chen Jia Xiang Primary School, and the Ji Feng Elementary School to inspect them in detail. At 4:00 PM, he went to the County Public Association and the library. At 5:00 PM, he went to the Education Bureau to review work diaries and all records, paying particular attention to the county's finances. He also instructed Section Chiefs Chen and Xiang to convene a discussion with the supervisors and education committee members. Section Chief Xiang also inspected the classes of the People's School attached to the People's Education Center. He returned to his residence at 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>(2) Teaching Method Key Points</p>
<p>(a) Apply the overall learning method and analytical learning method of ordinary teaching methods, and the law of preparation, law of practice, and law of effect of educational psychology.</p>
<p>(b) Regular classes, morning exercises, and extracurricular activities should be interconnected to avoid repetition, so as not to make students bored. (A) Regular class content emphasizes basic training and teaching methods and rules. The teacher's workload is heavier. (B) Extracurricular activities emphasize the students' actual practice. The teacher is only responsible for management. (C) Morning exercises or activities between classes pay attention to the harmonious activities of the body. Their role is to regulate life and focus on natural movements.</p>
<p>(c) Use group competition methods as much as possible.</p>
<p>(d) Hold skill tests at least once per semester. At the beginning of the semester, announce the test method in advance to encourage students to work hard in practice.</p>
<p>(e) National martial arts should start from strengthening physical fitness. The posture should be correct, the movements should be lively, and the meaning and function of each movement must be understood.</p>

<p>(h) Use holidays to create large-scale sports design activities, such as celebrations and joint sports meetings.</p>
<p>(i) Unite with other groups in sports to compare and promote progress.</p>
<p>(j) Use ability grouping methods as much as possible. Physical education grading cannot be based on ordinary intelligence grading. Because the age of students varies from place to place and the degree of physical development is different, students of the same grade may not be suitable for the same type of teaching materials. Therefore, within the possible scope, ability grading should be used as much as possible. The grading method should be based on the following six standards (see Appendix)</p>
<p>(k) Conduct health checkups at the beginning of each school year.</p>
<p>(l) Natural Gymnastics.</p>
<p>(m) When teaching various sports, if it is not possible to apply the overall learning method, or the posture is incorrect, basic exercises can be used to practice the basic methods of each sport.</p>
<p>Fifth. Appendix: Grading Method</p>
<p>(1) Gender, (2) Results of physical examination, (3) Age, height, weight, (4) Physical fitness, (5) Skills, (6) Grade.</p>
<p>Now, the six grading methods are briefly explained below.</p>
<p>(1) Gender: Boys and girls gradually develop differently after the age of twelve or thirteen.</p>
<p>Interests are also different, so physical education above junior high school should be taught completely in separate classes.</p>
<p>(2) Results of Health Examination: Health examination is one of the most important items in school administration. At least every student should be examined once a year. The results of the examination should be used as a reference for physical education grading. Students with poor physical development or defects should be given special instruction.</p>
<p>(3) Age, Height, Weight: It is difficult to teach students of different ages and development together in physical education class. Many schools use age, height, and weight grading methods. Some use only one, some use two together, and some use three together, and using three together is the best. McCloy's Physical Skills Standards Score Table can be borrowed and applied. A simple method is attached below. It can still be changed during application. For example, the table is divided into seven levels. We can divide it into two or three levels according to the index obtained by the actual junior high school students.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Education Commissioner Chen Bu Lei Goes to Beijing to Resign to the Central Government</p>
<h3 id="e143">Unrecovered From Illness, Fear of Delaying Bureau Affairs <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Education Commissioner Chen Bulei previously requested a two-month leave to recuperate in Shanghai. Later, he requested another two-week leave. Because the leave has expired, he took a express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou the day before yesterday. It is heard that he will deal with bureau affairs vigorously, and will go to Beijing in a few days to attend the Third Plenary Session. According to Chen, after two months of recuperation, although the illness has been slightly reduced, the root has not yet recovered. Even a little hard work makes him feel tired. His attention and thinking power have decreased. The duties of the Education Bureau are important, and a long term will inevitably cause many delays. Therefore, taking the opportunity to go to Beijing to attend the meeting, he still intends to ask the Central Government to resign from his concurrent positions.</p>

<p>Students from the first year of junior high school and the first year of kindergarten teachers' training at private Shanghai College suddenly went on strike. Yesterday, students Xu Meisheng and Liu Pei came to the museum to report that the reason for the disturbance was that the authorities dismissed Mr. Zhou, the head of the Chinese language department in the first year of junior high school and the first year of kindergarten teachers' training, midway, which caused some students to object. They immediately elected representatives to petition the party and request that Mr. Zhou continue to teach at the school. Because they did not get the point, they convened a general meeting and organized the Shanghai College kindergarten teachers' training first year junior high school first class all students to save Zhou and reject Bao. They issued a declaration. The authorities have expelled the 18 initiators.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Yesterday's Two Scota Cup Games Ended Displeasantly <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>A Misfortune for the Football Community</p>
<p>In the second week of the Scota Cup, the Yu You team faced the Lancashire team in a match at the baseball field yesterday. Yu You had a very good situation and seemed to have hope of winning. Unexpectedly, after winning two consecutive goals, they actually scored two goals themselves. Later, Lancashire scored another goal, and the score became two to three, with Yu You in a subordinate position. Of course, it was not difficult to reverse the defeat, but in the second half, because the referee's law enforcement was not strict, the players' actions were unchecked, and Yu You repeatedly made things difficult for the referee, and even expressed the attitude of not continuing the game. The game was temporarily suspended for two or three minutes. With the utmost persuasion of Chen Shaojun, the players continued the game. It is not known that when the final game had only six or seven minutes left, Yu You could not maintain its short time and ended in disorder. The referee also had no way to do so. Whether the result is valid will have to be resolved by the Western Football Association.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Winning Two Goals First But Sending Two Goals Oneself <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The bell rang three times, and Yu You kicked off first, and the momentum was extremely strong. Within twenty-five minutes, Wang Zhangbao won two consecutive goals, and for a time, they were overjoyed and felt that their spirits had doubled. But Lancashire was calm and unhurried, and worked hard to counterattack, so Yu You's goal was dangerous, and they often showed signs of panic and disorder. Liang Gongxun first treated the guests, scoring a goal himself. Coincidentally, it can be said that there is no coincidence. In a short time, Yu You Zhu scored a goal in front of the goal, the ball slipped backwards and hit Dong Xiaopei's head again, and rolled into his own goal. Ah Liang was unprepared and lost another goal, so Yu You's vitality was greatly damaged and felt regretful.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Losing Another Goal, Yu You's Life is Injured <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>After the result of the first half was two to two, not long after the second half started, Lancashire's right winger Kai Zhi scored another goal, making it three to two, and Yu You turned defeat into victory. From then on, the situation of the game was unsightly. Unexpectedly, Yu You expressed unwillingness to continue the game, leaving a stain on the senior team.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Loose Refereeing is the Root Cause <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's game had more barbarous player movements than the previous Jinan and Donghua games. Yu You's disorderly ending was also unexpected. However, the root cause is that the referee's law enforcement was not strict. In this situation, if the judgment is strict and the law is enforced like a mountain, and no relaxation is allowed, then the players will not be able to kick people without kicking the ball, and the event of leaving the field halfway will not occur. As for the team, it should adhere to the rule of "I will not offend others unless they offend me," and should be tolerant and generous, and eliminate vanity, then unfortunate events can be avoided. Chinese teams have repeatedly given foreigners a bad impression. What a sigh!</p>
<h3 id="e166">Impolite Spectators are Also One Reason <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in the stadium, there are often a small number of bad spectators who yell and cheer, contributing to the unprecedented stadium and creating the possibility of unruliness. Yesterday's Yu You incident was partly caused by a small number of bad spectators who helped Yu You leave the field. With only six or seven minutes left in the game, the audience even asked the Xie Jin Association to refund the tickets, making unreasonable demands. This is even more evident here. It is hoped that enthusiastic spectators and Chinese team players will never act on impulse. They must always think about the skills of the game, perform fewer deviant actions, avoid being ridiculed by foreigners, degrading their personality, and insulting the national prestige.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Western Police Eliminates French Merchants···Six to One··· <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>In the Scota Cup second week game between the Western Police and the French Merchants, the last time they tied five to five. Yesterday, they played again in the racecourse. As a result, the Western Police beat the French Merchants six to one and won the rematch right.</p>
<h3 id="e168">French Merchants are Utterly Defeated <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The French Merchants performed very well last week. In yesterday's battle, they were utterly defeated. The forwards were useless, scattered and unable to form an army, the mid-line was useless at all, and the defense was also very difficult to deal with. Goalkeeper Fulu Shou saved many dangerous balls and was praised.</p>
<p>[P Western Police's Shooting is Not Good &gt;</p>
<p>The Western Police almost always shot in front of the French Merchants' goal. The defense was average, Weiss and the others worked very hard. The forwards on both wings and Ke were excellent, but Pike's and Tui Na's shots were very bad, and the chances of shooting at an empty goal were innumerable.</p>
<h3 id="e169">French Business Leads the Record <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>In the first half, after fifteen minutes, the French team, through a pass from Faga, and Tuina's misstep, Marseille passed to Fafanqie, and Luo Laiduo shot and scored, taking the lead by one goal. It was fast and beautiful, and received great applause. Unexpectedly, this was the beginning of a complete defeat.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Western Patrol Scores Six Consecutive Goals <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Afterwards, although the Western Patrol team besieged continuously, they ultimately could not advance. Once, Parker, three feet in front of the goal, shot, but it rebounded off the left defender's body. Within the ten minutes before the end of the first half, Jack scored two consecutive goals, and Parker added one more, making it 3-1 in favor of the Western Patrol team. In the last ten minutes of the second half, Parker scored again, followed by Jack. Parker ultimately created a 6-1 victory.</p>

<p>People say that Jiang Shanjing is brave, but it is a pity that he is prone to over-the-top fouls. However, in recent matches, he has shown great improvement, being as fast as a swallow and as steady as Mount Tai. With Gu Shangrang's assistance yesterday, he was able to handle the situation with ease. At the beginning of the match, Jinan's morale was shaken by the absence of its mainstay, Xu Yahui. The opponent took advantage of this weakness and launched a major offensive. At that time, enemy figures frequently appeared in front of Jinan's goal. Although Jiang and Gu did their best to resist, their efforts were commendable. However, Lacks' poor shooting also made it difficult to win. Suddenly, Liu Zukan lofted a shot towards the goal, and the forwards surged forward like a tide. The opponent's inner defenders also rushed to defend. The ball appeared</p>
<p>Strange, leaping into the net from between the feet of both sides. Both sides were stunned and did not know what it meant. Jinan's victory in this goal seemed to be a harbinger of their victory that day.</p>
<p>Fan Enshi's Skills are Amazing</p>
<h3 id="e183">Two Long Shots Score Consecutively <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Lacks team has discovered a new player named Fan Shi, who appeared in the Hong Kong and Shanghai competitions a few years ago. He currently holds an important position in the team's midfield. Observing his superb skills, he will surely be able to replace Ga Xu's position in the future. At that time, seeing that Jinan's inner defenses were difficult to break and the goalkeeper was easy to deceive, he switched to long-range shooting. Once, from 50 yards away, he shot directly into the upper goalpost. Another time, from over 40 yards away, he also scored from the left corner. If Xie Quanhe had been prepared earlier, he could have prevented the disaster, but he was unable to react in time. In the first half, they lost 1-2.</p>
<p>Mei Hongbao is Small in Stature but Fast on his Feet</p>
<h3 id="e184">Achieves a Draw Within Five Minutes <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Jinan's center forward, Luo Haiguang, has had mediocre results recently, but in the five minutes after the start of the second half, he relied on his courage to score a goal. He took it in and attacked, but seeing the enemy's reinforcements arriving, he quickly used his ingenuity to transfer it to the right. Mei Hongbao was prepared, sprinted to catch up, and with his foot, the ball went out like an arrow straight into the goal, creating a 2-2 draw. Afterwards, Jinan's momentum was fierce, greatly different from before. Lacks' goal was full of trouble from then on. The goalkeeper was frightened and nearly lost the lead. Once, Jiang Shanjing kicked a free kick, imitating Fan Enshi, going straight for the goal, but it rebounded off the post. Mei then headed the ball out of bounds. With many twists and turns, Pei Ke suddenly broke through from the left and crossed the ball into the goal. Lacks took the lead again with a score of 3-2.</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe is Strong and Unstoppable</p>
<h3 id="e185">Scores Two More Goals to Maintain the Victory <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zhenhe is one of the famous generals of Shanghai. Recently, many have found it difficult to deal with his partner. In fact, he has had no place to use his skills. Yesterday, because he was being watched, he switched to alternating with Liu. The opponent lost their defense, and Chen was able to break through from the left. When he reached a critical point, he hooked the ball with his foot, and it landed in front of the goal. Mei headed the ball into the goal, making the score 3-3. Gu Haiguang committed a foul and was sent off the field. Jinan still continued to advance ferociously. Mei Hong displayed his skills and picked the ball up, and it happened to be in front of the goal. Chen Zhenhe took advantage of the situation to shoot, as if to compensate Gu, and surprisingly, they turned defeat into victory with a score of 4-3. With ten minutes remaining, the entire Jinan army retreated to focus on defense, not making any rash moves, fearing that they would suffer unexpected setbacks. Thus, they were able to maintain their victory and return triumphantly.</p>

The teams that have qualified for the basketball finals are John and Hujiang Affiliated Middle School, while the football finals will be contested by Jinling Affiliated Middle School and Huilan Middle School. There are no matches today; the champions and runners-up will be decided on Monday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e188">Football Group <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>(1) Jinling and Huilan Obtain Final Qualification in the Championship Group</p>
<p>Jinling Wins Hujiang Four to Zero. In the preliminary round, Jinling had defeated Cuiying by a large margin of 17-0, while Hujiang had defeated Zhijiang by 6-3. Therefore, both Jinling and Hujiang were strong teams. The semi-final held yesterday featured an extremely exciting performance. However, Jinling's forwards were particularly brave and skilled in short passing, and their defense was also very tight. Hujiang was defeated, and Jinling won 4-0, obtaining the final qualification.</p>
<p>Huilan Wins Yancheng Two to One. On the first day, Huilan had defeated John 3-2, while Yancheng had defeated Taowu 3-0. Huilan and Yancheng met yesterday in the semi-final. The performance of both teams was also commendable. As a result, Huilan eliminated Yancheng with a score of 2-1. The competitive situation was extremely intense. Huilan will meet Jinling in the final.</p>
<p>(2) John and Zhijiang Obtain Final Qualification in the Consolation Group</p>
<p>Zhijiang Wins Cuiying Two to Zero. In the first group of the consolation group semi-final, Zhijiang played against Cuiying. After 90 minutes of competition, Zhijiang won 2-0 and obtained the final qualification in the consolation group.</p>
<p>John Wins Taowu Eight to Zero. In the other group of the consolation group semi-final, John played against Taowu. John was quite strong, and unfortunately lost to Huilan 2-3 in the preliminary round. However, they had great hopes for the consolation championship (i.e., runner-up). Yesterday, they defeated Taowu 8-0. John will meet Zhijiang in the consolation final.</p>
<p>(3) Jinling and John are the Most Hopeful for Champion and Runner-Up</p>
<p>In this football championship, Jinling Affiliated Middle School is the most promising, as the team is extremely strong. John Affiliated Middle School should not have difficulty winning the consolation final. When they compete for the runner-up against the loser of the championship final, John should also be able to secure victory. Therefore, John is the most hopeful for the runner-up position.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Basketball Group <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>

<p>Xiaguang Wins Jiangwan Qingguang Wins Ye Shi</p>
<p>The Hujiang basketball team, in this Western Youth Basketball League, had great ambition to defeat the Navy and seize the championship. Unexpectedly, they suffered a setback midway, receiving a blow to the head. They lost to Nanxing last night by a score of 30-27, a difference of three points.

In the other three Group A matches, Chizhi defeated the US Navy 40-21, Xiaguang defeated Jiangwan 43-27, and Qingguang defeated Ye Shi 63-31.

<p>Hujiang Suffered a Miserable Defeat</p>
<h3 id="e191">Nanxing Has Made Great Progress <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Nanxing's victory over Hujiang was certainly not accidental. Last night's performance showed that they have made significant progress. Their movements were swift, and their defense was tight, preventing Hujiang's forwards from using their skills despite their bravery. Their attacks were well-organized, calm, and unhurried, which was the reason for their victory.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Hujiang's Fatal Wound <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Hujiang's defeat was due to a lackluster performance, which cannot be denied. Because their defense was not tight, Nanxing was able to break through at times. The forwards were also shaken by this. Although Wu Guolin remained the same as before, Feng Nianhua also missed shots. The biggest fatal wound was that their general, Qian Jingyong, was sent off for four fouls in less than ten minutes of the first half. The team was greatly shaken, and Wu Guolin's solitary struggle could not save the overall situation.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Nanxing Rises Suddenly <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Although the initial battle was fierce, Hujiang still held the advantage, leading 7-5. After Liu Shenzhan's two-point free throw, Nanxing suddenly rose to 10-7. At 14-8, Hujiang's Qian Jingyong was sent off, and Nanxing's momentum became even stronger. In the first half, Nanxing led by as many as eight points with a score of 18-10.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Both Sides Engage in Close Combat <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>At the start of the second half, Hujiang, with Wu Guolin's two long shots, quickly narrowed the score, with the score becoming 17-18, only one point behind. Continuing their efforts, Hujiang attacked desperately, and the score fluctuated up and down by one point, with the entire stadium being tense. However, Hujiang's Feng Nianhua was restricted by three fouls, making the outcome uncertain, and everyone was sweating for Hujiang.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Last Five Minutes <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>With five minutes remaining, Hujiang, with Wu Guolin's one point, took the lead by two points at 26-24. Nanxing's Bao Xindi then tied the game with a throw. With two minutes remaining, Nanxing took the lead by one point at 28-27. Sun Baoqing had a chance for a free throw, but missed both throws. Turning around, Sun committed his fourth foul and was sent off. Hujiang's situation was hopeless. At the final score, Nanxing won 30-27.</p>

<p>Commercial News: Financial Gold Market Shows Signs of Weakness</p>
<h3 id="e199">Weekly Fluctuations of Fourteen Taels, Strong Consolidation and a Drop of Four Taels <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>(With a fluctuation of five taels outside) Although the market trend yesterday was not overly volatile, there was also a fluctuation of more than five taels. Reviewing the initial weakness and subsequent stability, the final price was slightly lower by four qian compared to yesterday. Traders did not engage in much trading and their sentiment was hesitant. The initial decline was due to the impact of the recent decline and subsequent rise of the American bank, further indications, and the rebound in exchange rates. Subsequently, foreign exchange fluctuated slightly, with the British pound remaining stable and the American dollar easing, so the price of gold fluctuated slightly. Furthermore, there were reports in foreign news about the American debt situation, which was complex. Nevertheless, buyers on the surface once exceeded the 800-tael mark, but then weakened. The market was halted at 6 p.m. Checking the situation this week, it was chaotic, caused by conflicting war debt news. The highest price was 807 taels and 4 qian on Monday, and the price fluctuated greatly until it reached 787 taels and 8 qian on Thursday. It eventually stood at the 800-tael mark, with a total weekly fluctuation of 19 taels and 6 qian and a consolidated decrease of 4 taels, reversing the trend after four consecutive weeks of gains.</p>
<p>(A Slight Decline of Four Qian in Half a Day) The market opened at 797 taels and 2 qian in the morning, a decrease of 2 taels and 9 qian. There were then fluctuations of three to four qian. Dadecheng and other firms sold, immediately dropping by more than one tael to 95 taels and 6 qian. Suddenly, there was news that Citibank bought February American dollars at 4375 and also bought December at 25, and Hengxing entered the market to buy, and Fuyu and hedgers also bought, immediately rising by 1 tael and a half to 7 taels and 1 qian at 9:10 a.m. Huabi came out with March half-yuan, Zhaofeng, Changfeng, and retail investors sold, and immediately fell by more than 1 tael and 6-7 qian, ultimately reaching 5 taels and 4 qian. Huabi then absorbed February American dollars at 4375, and Dongya absorbed January at 3125. Furthermore, as the HSBC listing announcement had not been changed, it was 6 taels and 4 qian at 9:30 a.m. Subsequently, Hengxing, Hengyuantai, Yuanmao, Yongbingxing, Futai, Hongkangyong, etc. all competed to buy, but there was not much change in the exchange rate. The December American dollar settlement was at 25, and the old Citibank bought forward at 625 for March, hedging half-yuan, and the price of gold rose by more than one tael. However, from 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., there was only a few qian rebound, hovering between 97 and 8 taels. It was then heard that France seemed to be able to pay American debt, but other debts required that conditions be proposed and repaid. There was also news that England planned to borrow new money to repay old debts and was unwilling to use cash to repay, so traders were psychologically hesitant and the market price was slow to rise, but Zhifeng, Yongtianfeng, Yongyifeng, Yongyuanmao, etc. bought, because the bank had absorbed half a yuan for the March American dollar, and also bought English gold against the ninepence for January and 0625 for February. Until 11:00 a.m., the price of gold rose to 800 taels and 08 qian, and there was a brief drop of 1 tael. However, it hovered around 800 taels, and Yifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuantai, Wanxing, and retail investors sold, falling to 98 taels and 9 qian after 11:30 a.m. Yifeng, Fuyu, Dafeng, Hengheng Yu, etc. took advantage of this to buy, and Huabi Bank mutually traded February English gold for 9 pence in the near term and 8 pence 9375. Huabi absorbed half a yuan for the March American dollar, so the price rose by more than 1 tael, closing at 800 taels and 03 qian. At the noon close, it was 799 taels and 7 qian, a further decrease of 4 qian from the previous day, and it then traded at 9 taels and 12 qian. The maximum price in the morning was 800 taels and 08 qian, and the minimum price was 795 taels and 4 qian, with a fluctuation of 5 taels and 4 qian. The red total was added to 12 and a half taels. The quoted price remained at 865 taels with the American dollar unchanged, equivalent to 70 taels. Later, it was 64-5 taels and 66 taels at noon, ultimately 65 taels, the same as the previous day. The booked price was 801 taels to 800 taels, with a watering allowance of 02 taels.</p>
<p>(Transaction Volume Still Not Wholesale) Transactions on the surface were still not in wholesale numbers. Zhifengzhiyong, Yuanmao Yong, Yuanchun, Tianfeng Yong, Hengchangyong, Bingxing, etc. all bought, and Wanxing, Yuantai, Hongkangyong, Fuyu, Futaiheng, etc. sometimes bought and sold. Furthermore, HSBC mostly bought more hedges than they sold. The Dalian gang bought more than 200 items, and only sold about 100 items. The Guang gang Hengxing bought about 5-600 items, Yifeng bought a few items, and the total number of items across all firms was about 21,700.</p>

Although the clearing procedures were not yet completed, most of the amounts could be calculated. Any remaining urgent matters would be handled next Monday. Therefore, the settlement situation was very simple. However, because it was the 10th of the month, the settlement of silver dollars and public bills in the money market was tighter. Even though it was not as much as usual for the 10th, it was definitely better than usual.</p>
<p>〓Dollar Interest Strengthens, Silver Discount Weakens〓</p>

<p>(Whole Six Bonds Dropped Sharply, Others Recovered Slightly, Trading Reached 12.5 Million)</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange had a good futures market. The market prices fluctuated greatly, and trading was active. The spot market continued to be extremely scarce. At the beginning of the morning, due to news of tense situation in the Northeast and the Japanese army invading Rehe, market sentiment was uneasy, and sellers surged. All prices continued the trend of the previous day and declined sharply. For example, the Disbandment Bond price once fell to around 53 yuan. Other prices also declined significantly. The market environment turned better in the later market, and the market had a turning point. Large investors had already started to buy, and retail buying was also better than before. All prices rose in unison. As a result, compared to the previous day, only the Whole Six current and futures contracts and the Customs Duty forward contracts fell sharply. The Reorganization Bond also decreased slightly, and the 20-Year Financial Short-Term Bond fell by 4 yuan and was suspended from trading. Other bonds recovered by about half a yuan. The bond market will shift according to changes in the diplomatic situation. It is said that the total spot trading for the day was only 5,000 yuan, and futures trading was more than 12.5 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>[P Yarn Market Had Short Covering in the Afternoon]</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was flat and weak in the morning. Reports of tight situations in Tianjin and the Japanese army shelling Yu Guan caused depressed sentiment. Although American cotton rose, the market could not rise accordingly. In the afternoon, it was heard that Sichuan merchants were purchasing several hundred bales, and the tense cotton market caused the yarn market to rise, but business on the floor was very sluggish. The future still depends on actual sales. According to sources from a cotton industry organization, Shanghai's Chinese yarn inventory is 82,365 bales.</p>
<p>(People's Standard Traded Volume Low) The People's Standard market opened flat in the morning. Due to current events, sentiment was weak. As a result, all months were flat. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered, and the market rose slightly, with each month rising by 3-4 qian. Total trading volume for the day was 10,900 bales. Rongxing sold 850 bales, Mingde 650 bales, Yongda 300 bales, Yiyu 300 bales, and Daji 400 bales. Dachang bought 550 bales, Yuda 350 bales, Yicheng 450 bales, and Xincheng 250 bales.

<p>Cotton Market Remains Strong</p>
<p>丨But There Are Rumors of Indian Cotton Approaching Shanghai丨</p>
<p>The cotton market remained strong as American cotton rose again, further anchoring buyers' sentiment. Many shorts, seeing the good quality of foreign cotton, actively covered their positions, making the market particularly strong. However, there are rumors of Indian cotton approaching Shanghai. It is said that Shenxin Factory purchased 2,000 pieces of Pingguoer, 1,000 pieces of Kangdi Xuzhi, and 1,000 pieces of Wengmula, totaling 4,000 pieces, which will be shipped to Shanghai immediately. However, the prices have not been officially announced. If Indian cotton can indeed come to Shanghai, the impact on Chinese cotton is feared to be significant.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Market Turned Flat Later) The Zheng Standard market opened tight in the morning. As American cotton rose, sentiment improved, and buying interest was slightly stronger, with each month rising by 1 qian. In the afternoon, news of fixed shipments of Indian cotton caused the market to flatten slightly. However, there was still a shortage of new sellers, and distant months rose another 5 fen. Total trading volume for the day was 31,100 dan.

<p>Two Problems: War Debt and Relief Legislation</p>
<p>New York, 9th Telegram: A report on the cotton market for the week. Yesterday, the sudden increase in the government's cotton production estimate, reaching a huge 780,000, was unexpected. However, the impact on the market was minimal because prices had already fallen, and there were few speculative bulls. Therefore, when prices fell, sales from the South and bull liquidations were absorbed by colleagues buying and short covering. At the same time, the March contract reached the low price of June. However, due to the uncertainty of war debt and cotton field relief legislation, trading was restricted. Sources here are still questioning whether a fundamental relief plan will be passed in the current congressional agenda. At the same time, investor sentiment, based on original prices, seems to be still focused on the increase in harvest estimates, which may further strengthen their attack. If the war debt problem is resolved, trading may improve. The weekend statistics are attached on the left.</p>

<p>丨Land Prices and Firm Positions Both Rise丨</p>
<p>The sales of golden needle vegetables have been active recently. Over the past ten days, Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, and other groups have purchased about 1,500 packages, which has greatly boosted the market. According to local sources, the purchase price has increased by one to two liang. The firm positions here have also increased accordingly. Yesterday, a firm from Zhenjiang opened a batch of country-grown vegetables at a price of 13 liang, which was also in high demand. It is estimated that there are about 3,000 packages stored in firms and only several hundred packages stored in firms. Zhenjiang only has several hundred packages. The total amount cannot be said to be large. From a long-term perspective, there will be good prospects. Yesterday, the firm's offer for top country-grown vegetables was 14 liang to 14 liang and 5 qian, upper-middle grade was 13 liang and 3 qian to 13 liang, middle grade was 12 liang and 6 qian to 7 qian, lower grade was 11 liang and 5 qian to 6 qian, and old and inferior grades were 7 liang to 8 liang.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Areas for Improvement in Inexpensive Drying, Production, and Packaging of Lanzhu Branches <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>(Lychee Dried) Lanzhu branches are produced in Tongzhou, Fujian. This year, due to abundant harvests in Haikou, Guangdong, and other places, sales have been greatly affected. In previous years, market prices were comparable to those of Jinshan branches produced in Guangdong and even surpassed them occasionally. However, this year, market prices have suddenly reversed. The reason is that the selection of Lanzhu branches is not done properly. For example, in ordinary mixed-brand Lanzhu branches, small, pointed grains are mixed in up to 20%. After various firms purchase them, there are very few outlets for the original goods. Sorting them requires time and is not cost-effective. Therefore, even during periods of strong sales, almost no one cares about Lanzhu branches in the Shanghai market. However, Jinshan branches are quite active, with liquidation in various places. Even Hang       and other inland areas, which have sales outlets, have switched to Jinshan branches. However, it is difficult to get a good price. From this, we can see that the reason for the stagnation of Lanzhu branches is entirely due to the impurity of the goods. The advantages and disadvantages of Lanzhu branches and Jinshan branches are described below so that the owners in the producing area can pay attention to them and avoid making mistakes.</p>
<p>(Jinshan Branches) "Packaging" Each box weighs 50 pounds, which is convenient for shipping. There are fewer broken boxes, and the loss of weight is not much. "Body" Most are baked dry and have enough moisture to prevent mold and worms and can be stored for a long time. "Goods" Sweeter, fresher, and more tender, with uniform particles. Even smaller particles are round, fleshy, and edible.</p>
<p>(Lanzhen Branches) "Packaging" Each box weighs about 100 jin. During shipping, the boxes are easily broken, and the weight loss is more significant. "Body" The baking process is often insufficient, and the water content is not exhausted, so it is easy to mold and worm. Sometimes, the heat is too strong, and the flesh turns black and tastes bitter. Both over and under are difficult to store for a long time and are not suitable. It is best to dry them in the sun, which makes the shell and flesh bright and lovely. However, when it is cloudy and rainy, baking is necessary, so attention must still be paid to the drying method. "Goods" The sweetness is less pronounced, and the undergrowth also has a slight sourness. If the flesh is not as tender as when it is freshly picked, the small nucleus and thick flesh can make up for its shortcomings. The particles are uneven, and the small particles are pointed, thin, and tasteless, merely a formality.</p>
<p>This year, the harvest of Lanzhu branches in Zhangzhou was normal, so the local prices were higher when the new goods were released, which was not very suitable for sales. Later, due to the influx of Jinshan branches, prices fell to  compete with them. In addition, because there were too many pointed particles in the goods, sales were almost zero. Even now, not only has the selling price fallen behind that of Jinshan branches, but sales have also remained sluggish. The main reason is that the goods are impure. During periods of market  , goods  should be  superior in order to gain a foothold. Otherwise, there will be no failure.</p>

<p>丨Firm Positions Are Righteous and Strong丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the coin market was quieter, given the current week and the stable price of standard gold, without significant fluctuations.  In the area  , the Guild's indicated price for 24 coarse sand white was still 15 liang and 4 qian and a half for the highest quality, and 15 liang and 3 qian and 2 fen and a half for ordinary goods, a slight decrease of 2 fen and a half compared to the previous day. No transactions were heard. There was little fluctuation in the prices of 8, 9, and 10-lotus red northerners. Firm positions also rarely opened. Although there were discussions about the price of this factory's ice flower blue, the goods were of lower quality and had to be finalized after  sampling  . Jianbing firms remained tight-lipped, and the market was  in and out  , with no intention of forming a group. Therefore, there were even fewer transactions. Inventory is indeed low, with firms only having a total of a thousand boxes.</p>

<p>丨Dalian Group's Spot Flour Liquidated Slightly丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, each month generally showed a stable trend. As the prices of foreign wheat only fluctuated by a few points, the market was generally flat at the beginning. However, each factory remained on the sidelines, and transactions were very quiet. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, transactions seemed to be slightly smoother, as the Dalian Group liquidated spot flour, and futures also showed a slight recovery. As for the factory situation, Fufeng bought near-term positions due to strong spot demand but sold off a large number of far-term positions. Fuxin sold near-term positions and left far-term positions unchanged. Therefore, although the market showed an uptrend, the rise was not significant. However, as the prices of spot flour in this port were too high, and the Tianjin Group had not yet settled on many Dingbian flours, it seemed that manufacturers had to change their attitudes in order to avoid future worries. As a result, this month was slightly better by 2.5 li compared to the previous day, January was better by 5 li, February was better by 1.25 fen, March was unchanged, April was better by 7.5 li, and May was better by 2.5 li.</p>

<p>丨Extremely Thin Local Wheat Inventory丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, each month generally showed a circling trend. As the prices of foreign wheat fluctuated slightly, sentiment naturally showed little change. However, the local wheat inventory was very thin, and each factory was quite interested in buying. The number of chips on the exchange was naturally scarce. As the saying goes, rare things are precious. The industry's thoughts were naturally firm. Due to the slight hedging of foreign wheat, the market was also stable in the distant months. As a result, there was no comparison for this month, January was better by 1 fen, February was slightly worse by 1 fen, and March and April were each better by 1 fen.</p>

<p>Free Talk Short Story The Thief (1) Zhu Their stomachs were empty, rumbling loudly. As they walked along those roads brighter than daylight, they felt truly impatient. The reds, the greens, the bright, the shiny, so many things to eat and use, but they could only look, with no benefit. Walking like this, they felt only hatred. They chose to walk in the dimly lit areas under the electric lights, passing through several streets, turning and twisting, until they truly reached a very dark place. This road was paved with small stones, far less smooth than the asphalt roads they had walked on before. The electric lights were so sparse, and they didn't know what kind of houses these were. The doors were all tightly closed. There were also a few places where a flickering, dim lamp shone from the narrow entrances, vaguely illuminating the red or black characters of "×× Grand Hotel." There were also some signs for buildings and restaurants, hanging there, strangely greasy. The electric lights in the small grocery stores were quite bright on the wide street. From several dark alley entrances, there were stalls baking sesame cakes, two or three men with greasy faces sitting on long benches, like monkeys, one foot curled up, squatting on the edge of the bench, both hands tightly hugging their knees, their expressions as if they had been drowsing for half a day. "It looks like this place will do." "Okay, let's go a little further. We need to find a place where we can stretch our legs and arms. If there's no food, then fine, let's just sleep well and see what happens tomorrow!" They couldn't be blamed for feeling this way. These two weak sentences, scattered in the air, were so clear and chilling. Approaching the edge of a wider set of stone steps, Sanda pulled on the corner of Dafa's coat, and with a turn, Dafa fell to the ground. "Sanda, I'm telling you, this really is a good place." Sanda stretched his legs out very straight, feeling that all his joints were comfortable, letting Dafa's words scatter in the silence, without answering. He suddenly kicked Dafa's butt, and even Dafa lay down with his legs stretched straight. "Damn it, why did you kick me, you son of a bitch?" Dafa cursed Sanda. "To make you sleep more comfortably. Why are you bending your butt?" Dafa had no words, and turned over again. In a few minutes, the snoring of the two men sounded together. Dafa saw the tall chimneys, piles of factory buildings. A young worker was telling him many things, and his heart seemed to be pulled tightly by something, holding his breath, thinking in his heart. Just as he was holding his breath, he heard two very clear snapping sounds, which somehow drove the young worker away. He immediately opened his eyes, looking for clarity. Then he heard the sharp sound of a police whistle, and suddenly sat up, looking around at the dim street. All the factories and workers were just a dream. A shadow flashed before his eyes, and then several more snaps sounded in succession. He didn't understand what was going on. He pushed Sanda, who didn't wake up. Looking back, he saw two people standing at the entrance of a store, saying things he didn't understand. Dafa couldn't help but ask: "What's going on?" A middle-aged man turned his head, made an annoyed expression, and turned his head back. "Catching hobos, catching robbers!" Another younger man said to Dafa. He really wanted to see what catching robbers was like. Seeing someone running ahead, he followed and ran in that direction. After sleeping for a while, he didn't know where the strength came from. He caught up with that person and turned to the right. The street was even darker here. After running a short distance, he saw several men in coarse cloth clothes gathered together, looking ahead at a white, misty street. He lost his original interest and joined the group of people. He really didn't expect to see an injured person lying there, a large patch of bright red blood smeared on the dark road, half of his clothes soaked in blood. "This is truly making a wronged ghost. I don't know where those two robbers have escaped to," said a man with a full beard, gesturing wildly. Dafa finally understood. He looked again at the wronged ghost on the ground, a young man, but when he looked up at the other people, he couldn't find a single face that showed surprise or sympathy. "Oh, a scapegoat, a wronged ghost, a starving ghost, there are countless of them every day. We ourselves don't even know what kind of ghost we'll be tomorrow," the man said and left. "Hatred" and "Love" Xing "Hatred" and "love" are the source of life, which is to say, the vitality of life. Without "hatred" and "love," perhaps this universe would become a wasteland. For example, the Russian Revolution, which they claimed was based on "hatred." And the National Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen was based on "love," so Mr. Sun often wrote the two characters "universal love" when giving inscriptions. Can you deny the great power of "love" and "hatred"? The opposition of "love" and "hatred" is just like "laughter" and "crying," but without "love," there would be no "hatred," just as without "crying," there would be no "laughter." The "power of love" certainly makes people feel relaxed and comfortable, as if sitting in a spring breeze, but it can sometimes lead to relaxation. After relaxation, one will feel tired. And "hatred," if it cannot be vented, will be like a poisonous snake, forever gnawing at our hearts. For example, the "hatred of national subjugation" of Korea and India, will this hatred ever have an end? Furthermore, when Yang Guifei hanged herself, Bai Juyi also wrote a high poem "Song of Everlasting Regret" for her, and as for Daiyu's short life, there are still many "Baoyu" who hold regret for her for thousands of years, although it is said that this is only a private affair between children, unrelated to national affairs. "Hatred," "love," the source of life, the vitality of life, but what about our vitality of life? What about our source of life? Half of the Northeast territory has been cut away by others, and we are still indulging in decadent pleasures and singing and dancing in peace, is this "hatred"? Is it "love"? Or is it without hatred and without love? What is without hatred and without love? It is wood and stone, it is a pool of stagnant water. Let us stir up some waves in the stagnant water! Fundraising Ms. Wang Wanrong We were a group of eight people, dragged to Shizi Street near the school to raise military pay for the Northeast Volunteer Army. We had decided long ago: we would set off at eight in the morning and return for class at ten. "Is your master up yet? Please donate some military pay!" Mei said, when we walked into the first house. "Oh dear! Here they come again, asking for money! Get out quickly! If you wake up the old lady, she'll scold me again." A maid pushed Pei, Pei took a step back and stepped on my foot. I endured the pain and retreated with them! A chartered car was being pulled over from the east. Chun released her athletic nature, and started chasing after it. The driver couldn't outrun her. After only four or five steps, Chun grabbed him and said: "Please generously donate some military pay!" "Please donate four jiao, I'll give you a receipt, so if you encounter a fundraising team from another school later, you won't have to donate again." We also rushed over and surrounded the chartered car. Xue waved the receipt in her hand and said. "What military pay or no military pay? You female students go and fundraise from women! Do you even understand 'men and women should not touch hands'? How can you be chasing after men on the street?" No one expected that a young man wearing a suit with a badge on his chest would say such a thing. "This is terrible!" "How ridiculous!" "You traitorous bastard!" Everyone shouted. The driver broke through the encirclement and ran forward! We walked into the second house! What a big mansion! An old lady was supervising several servants making flour balls. "Please donate some military pay!" Rong put the bamboo donation container on the nearby table, saying this. She was really exhausted! "Girls! We never donate here. We are not from Suzhou," the old lady refused, saying. "That's right! Because you have never donated before, we must ask you to donate a little today. It doesn't matter whether you are from Suzhou or not, in any case, you are a Chinese citizen. If the Volunteer Army wasn't fighting the Japanese in the Northeast, would you still be able to eat flour balls?" I said. Really, who would believe her? Speaking in a completely pure Suzhou dialect, and still trying to deny it, what's the point of denying it? "Eating is something everyone has to do! How can anyone not eat?" The old lady glared at me. "Yes," I said again. "In order to make sure the Volunteer Army doesn't have to fight on an empty stomach, we came out to fundraise!" "Oh dear! I won't talk to you all anymore! You female students are so eloquent and speak so nicely! How can us old women win against you? Fine, take a few coppers! Do you want them or not?" The old woman threw three coppers onto the table. Ying picked them up and stuffed them into the bamboo container. "Actually, you are doing this with good intentions..." the old woman continued to babble. I couldn't help but laugh. We took her three coppers and stopped talking. Of course it was "good intentions"! We walked into the third house, into a large hall. Four or five accountants were calculating rent rice, striking the abacus beads crisply and skillfully! "Oh dear! Here come the fundraisers again! Let me be honest with you: we don't want to be fooled again!" A man with glasses said, looking at the characters on our banner. "Take ten coppers! You can buy a few big cakes to eat. There are plenty of silver dollars and banknotes, but..." A short, fat man spoke the most venomously! Who knows where he saw students buying big cakes with the money they raised? But no one argued with him. Arguing with an ignorant person is the most foolish thing to do. We finally accepted the money and retreated! After walking to over a hundred households, seeing enough ugly faces, and hearing enough unpleasant words, the coppers we raised hadn't even filled a third of our bamboo container. "Sigh, why are Chinese people so selfish?" Mei shook her head and sighed. "Sigh..." Pei also shook her head and took a breath of cold air. Cat Youming Mo Bo Sang said: "All poets love cats," I feel that this sentence is very reasonable; because of the gentle nature of cats, lively posture, smiling face, fine and soft fur, agile climbing ability, is really all lovable! Friends who like to play with cats, once they see this appearance, always can't help but shout: "This lively little thing, little guy, clever little darling". Not to mention sensitive poets! I am also a cat lover, but I don't have the talent of a poet and can't express my liking for cats, which is a pity. The ancients said: "Cats are reincarnated from seven generations of young women (prostitutes)." This probably refers to their frivolity and coquettishness. I have raised several cats, but halfway through, they either died or were lost, so the memories they left me are very deep. I remember when I was sixteen years old, I raised a cat, that cat left me with the deepest memories, I really loved that cat at that time! Although it was lost later, I still remember it: That cat was obtained from my aunt's house. At that time, it had only been out of its mother's belly for two months, but it was already running and jumping like a little tiger. I liked its smallness and liveliness, so I asked my aunt for it. It was considered the most lively and lovable one in the nest. The color of the kitten was very beautiful, a mixture of yellow, white, and black, like a lively and lovely little tiger, adding to its "tiger shape." However, it was not as big and fierce as a tiger. It was full of "vitality," with round eyes, fine and soft fur, gentle nature, lively posture, like a happy girl, full of brightness and purity. It was truly a typical cat! There was also that short, round body, growing fine and soft downy hair, a round and lovely little head, the most prominent two gypsum-like small ears, that round, pointed chin, and exquisite little mouth, so lovable! Ah! There was also that red little nose, slightly moist, shining with a watery light. That kitten had a unique innocence, always jumping around all day long, never stopping, and when it jumped, its nimble little body seemed very lively and interesting. One day, I came home from school, ate lunch, and basked in the sun in the hallway. I unintentionally saw the little calico cat sitting "refreshed" on the threshold. It had a very good "horse stance," sitting stably and upright. That kind of great spirit was like a hero commanding a million soldiers, and also like a big bug dominating in the deep mountains! At that time, I almost jumped up! I was very excited, a kind of desire gradually rose in my body, rose along my nerves, ran in my limbs, making my teeth clench, my hands had an unbearable itching, I quickly clenched my fists. That lively little thing/little guy was sitting there looking down on everything, sometimes turning its lively and alert little head, as if searching for something, sometimes using its soft forelimbs, the forelimbs with the sharp claws retracted, wiping its round, pointed face indifferently. I observed for a while, wanting to wait for it to finish wiping its face before grabbing it into my arms. But it just kept wiping its/light red little nose calmly. I got annoyed waiting, so I strode over and hugged the little guy tightly. Its trembling limbs and fine, soft fur slid in my hands, and I felt a kind of mysterious heat. This heat made me relax my hands, which were holding it tightly because I felt it was too cute. I embraced it very gently, caressed it very lovingly, and combed its fur. It was very happy, murmuring softly, rolling in my arms, its lovely forelimbs, which had retracted their sharp claws, waving wildly in the air, like small hands wanting to fold something. I turned it over, and the sunlight stimulated its eyelids, making it feel very uneasy, it narrowed its eyelids and screamed "Meow! Meow!" in anger. I knew it was annoyed, so I turned it over again and put it on the ground. It jumped down, feeling very free, stretched its waist, stood up, shook its body a few times, and ran away very lively with a "Tuk!······Tuk!" A few days later, I unintentionally walked into the dining room and saw it arching its back, standing up its tail,贴on the corner of the wall, I was curious and went closer to observe. It turned out that A Wang (dog's name) was picking up bone shells under the dining table to eat. For its safety, I held it in my arms, its limbs were still shaking slightly, at this time it was lying in my arms very comfortably and coquettishly, two emerald green eyes looking at me with a glimmering radiance. I chased A Wang away and then let it down. I took a rope and teased it with it, and it held up its cute little forelimbs like small hands and chased after it. A Wang thought we were gone and came back silently with his head lowered. I chased him away again, and he was startled. I felt he was too rude and barbaric, like the fellow in "Water Margin" Flower Monk from Mount Wutai, because he had repeatedly stolen the chicken feed, so I hated him very much. Although A Wang was chased away by me, he ran a few steps and suddenly turned around and looked at us fiercely and unkindly, looking jealous. His ears were standing straight up, and a pair of round eyes were emitting a wolf-like green light. He thought, "Why are you protecting this little thing/little guy so well? This little thing/bad kid is so naughty, running and jumping so happily in front of the little master, climbing lively, with a smiling face, and acting coquettishly with the little master, and also struggling in the cage. This kind of frivolous behavior, naturally can't get into his eyes, so he could only say 'Qiang' and run elsewhere with his head lowered, 'lost'." One afternoon, I came home from school and suddenly felt lonely. I wanted to play with the kitten, but I looked everywhere and couldn't find a trace of the lovely kitten; at that time, I felt a wisp of inexplicable sadness in my heart. Could it be that the little thing that had been with me for the past few months was lost? Or was it that someone saw how cute it was and took it away? At that time, I felt very melancholy. Day after day passed, and when I had free time after school, I always felt lost and unhappy. After a while, I heard a neighbor say: "Your family's kitten was taken away by a strange passerby one afternoon." At that time, I received confirmation. I have raised several cats, and the feelings it left me are the deepest, so I always have good feelings for cats. Cats are indeed a lovely little animal/a loyal domestic animal. The Crossroads of Love in the Long Creative Era 11 Zhang Ziping In the classroom, there was no order at all, and it was extremely noisy. The first class was inorganic chemistry, and the teacher designated Holleman's Inorganic Chemistry as a reference book. However, very few people in the same grade bought this book. Although Haiquan bought one, he rarely opened it to read, because that book was really laborious and not easy to read. Most people just copied the teacher's lecture notes. Yingkui also bought a textbook, and it was also left in the box. It was very strange that he just sat and listened in the classroom, without taking any notes at all. "Why don't you take notes?" "Forget it!" "What about the exam?" "Forget it!" Yingkui seemed to have long been disappointed with science. But he didn't change his major. The classmates didn't know why. (6) Although Haiquan was in the classroom all day today, most of his thoughts were not on his studies, but on Mrs. Hezi. "Japanese women are so gentle and so kind." At three o'clock, everyone was dismissed from school. Haiquan was alone in the classroom, just finishing packing his bag, ready to leave, when he suddenly saw Tang Yaoxing hurrying to his desk. "Are you going back already? Are you busy?" Yaoxing asked him this. "What's the matter? A grade meeting?" Because Tang Yaoxing was in charge of their grade, Haiquan asked him this. "No, a few of us friends want to organize a purely literary group and plan to publish a magazine every month. They want me to bring in one or two more friends. But I have limited friends, so I had to come and ask you." "I don't understand literature. What's the point of having me join?" "It doesn't matter. Come and take a look. If you're willing, then join." "Who is in charge?" "One of our fellow villagers, a very sincere person, a writer who just returned from France. He is quite famous." "What's his name?" "Guess." "Chen Huamin, isn't it?" "···················" Tang Yaoxing nodded.</p>

<p>Amateur Weekly (Hengzhi) Second Issue Amateur Ramblings Hints of Awakening Dawn of Transformation Pu Since the launch of the first issue of Amateur Weekly and the employee communication column met with readers, what inspires the reporter most is more than two hundred letters discussing the issues and manuscripts describing the various tragic and inhuman lives of workers and apprentices. On the employee side, although they are in a higher position than workers and apprentices, in reality, the economic pressure and the suffering of intellectual hunger are not much different. We analyze the content of the letters and submissions we have received, and almost 90% of them are about economic difficulties and extremely hard work, as well as issues of how to continue to improve knowledge in their spare time. At this time when internal strife has not stopped and diplomacy is most urgent, the reporter listened to these many sincere, angry, and hell-like cries of resentment, and could not help but feel extremely sad. We see this Europeanized Shanghai, on one side it is so magnificent and splendid, and on the other side it is so gloomy and cruel. The future of the country has really reached an unimaginable point. However, in a flash, I thought that these cries contain infinite hints of awakening and a glimmer of transformation. If we can materialize this ability to awaken and amplify this glimmer of transformation, it may not be an insider's path to saving the nation and ourselves, so I unconsciously became excited again. However, how can we achieve this method of materialization and amplification is a creative problem that belongs to the realm of not having a teacher to inherit. We who grew up in this fragmented society are of course without any experience to speak of. Therefore, we now only have the attitude of researching and experimenting at the same time, and explore step by step. We only need to firmly believe that the transformation of the small environment is created by a few people, and the transformation of the big environment is created by the majority of people. We believe that the more we research and experiment, the more we can increase the formation of materialization and amplify the possibility of transformation. Speaking of this, I may as well take a suggestion from a letter that the reporter just received from Hong Jun to end this rambling, and at the same time give everyone an inspiration for research. The general idea of Hong Jun's letter is that most of the oppression of the environment suffered by most apprentices is the same. Most of them live a life of unhappiness all day long. Therefore, Hong Jun suggested that all the apprentices who read this journal should take this opportunity to have the journal act as an intermediary, and then each person should communicate with each other, and mutually express their opinions on improving their living environment. If this allows people with similar personalities to gradually become familiar with each other, and then further become intimate friends, wouldn't it be of great benefit in terms of improving life and cultivating scholarship? The reporter deeply feels that Hong Jun's suggestion has great research value, and specifically proposes it here as a reference for everyone's awakening and transformation. As for the original text of the letter, it will be announced in the employee communication column on another day, and readers are welcome to express their opinions. Issue Discussion Problem of Improving Amateur Entertainment Amateur Entertainment and Playing Mahjong Yeping Anyone can believe that almost most of the amateur enthusiasts are spending their precious and limited entertainment time on playing mahjong. Because of this widespread fact, especially in Shanghai or other larger cities, playing mahjong is an open gambling behavior, so it has value worth discussing and researching. Our starting point for discussion is: amateur entertainment is absolutely necessary. Because after a person has gone through more than eight hours of office life every day, they are mentally extremely tired or depressed. Although sleep can restore the spirit, if there are only two monotonous and cyclical lifestyles of sleep and work every day, that is absolutely impossible. That will simply shorten your life geometrically. This is something that must be paid attention to in life. Secondly, we want to discuss whether playing mahjong is suitable for amateur entertainment? I can say with certainty that playing mahjong is absolutely not suitable for amateur entertainment. Besides the harm, you can't find any benefits from it. Over time, after you get used to playing, first, you will inevitably suffer losses materially. In total, none of the people who play mahjong can win money, otherwise, there will be no money for the first game. The four people playing mahjong and the owner are like five tanks, one empty in the middle, like the owner, and four around are filled with water, like the four people playing mahjong. So the process of winning or losing in each game of mahjong is like scooping water from the four tanks with water and scooping it back and forth, and each time you scoop, you must drop some into the empty tank, which is what is called "playing the first game". After continuing like this for a long time, the result is: the four tanks that were originally filled with water are almost exhausted, and the empty tank that had no water originally, the empty tank that reaps the benefits, does the opposite and gets a full tank of water. Therefore, the four people sitting and playing mahjong, statistically speaking day by day, none of them do not lose money, but the degree of loss is somewhat different. Under the current social situation, money is an element of life, and since money is lost, it will definitely be related to mental pain. But there is even worse. If you don't play mahjong, it's fine, but once you start playing mahjong, you play four rounds--at least four rounds, then another four rounds, and then another four rounds, ..., you won't stop until everyone is exhausted and can't sit anymore! This is a common problem. Therefore, once you start, you often have to stay up until two or three in the morning before you can sleep, or even fight all night long! In this way, no matter how strong your body is, as a result, gradually, at first, your body feels a little uncomfortable, headache, back pain, ..., and later, inevitably, neurasthenia, insomnia, and other similar diseases will climb onto your body. Friends, may I ask what is the original intention of entertainment? The above is just two of its most obvious harms. In addition, a person who likes to play mahjong will definitely not pay attention to hygiene. After playing cards, wiping their face, they immediately go to the office, which is a common occurrence. Even after finishing work the next day, they come back to do what they call the unfinished work from the day before. This is only harmful and not beneficial to the body, which can be asserted. In short, I sincerely hope that friends who play mahjong can jump out of this deep pit and embark on other proper paths. The Problem of Small Office Workers' Life Forced Transactions Hui Zheng "Gift-giving" is something that often troubles us small office workers in the company. After the general affairs department sends the salary every month, it is often found that there are always a few yuan less, sometimes even a third of it is deducted, the reason is; the general affairs department sent a few gifts on your behalf and deducted the money. The income of senior staff is much higher than ours. Of course, deducting a few yuan from them is not a big deal. (There is still important text, turn to the second page)</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>However, for us small office workers with thirty or forty yuan, it is a bit of a problem. Originally, apart from the necessary living expenses, there is not a penny left. In this way, we have no choice but to go into debt. Therefore, we all sigh in unison about "gift-giving". Originally, "gift-giving" was based on the feelings between humans. A has something worth commemorating or happy, such as having a child, and people who have good feelings with A will send him a gift, on the one hand to increase his happiness, on the other hand to leave him a souvenir. Again, if A encounters a sad or unfortunate event, such as the death of his parents, he will also send a gift to comfort his soul, but in modern times, especially in Shanghai, it has become a kind of "forced transaction". Not to mention friends with feelings, even a colleague among thousands of people who has nothing to do with me must also send a gift, and sometimes, I don't even know what the face of the gift recipient looks like. When you have something going on, I have to send a gift and have a meal. When I have something going on, you also have to send a gift and come for a meal. Formally speaking, it is "gift-giving", but in essence, it is a "forced transaction". (Those who borrow things to extort money are another matter) Again, speaking from the whole of society, this is an infinitely large waste! The national crisis is getting deeper and deeper, and the country is getting poorer and poorer. Let's slow down and talk about "frugality" to save the country. Why don't we first eliminate this infinitely large waste in society - gift-giving? A little less waste, of course, saves us from a bit of poverty, which also saves the country a bit of wealth. Eliminate the habit of "gift-giving", and at the same time, do not accept other people's gifts, and organize a non-gift-giving alliance. I think this is precisely the seed of our amateur social movement in the industrial and commercial world! Life in the Industrial and Commercial World Apprentice Life Apprentices Are Not Allowed to Seek Knowledge A Yang The life of apprentices in old stores, I had already heard half of it when I was studying. From sweeping the floor and wiping the table to cleaning pipes, until they worked for the store staff, they participated in everything heavy and trivial. This three-year period--apprentices in stores must complete three years to become journeymen--not only sells out labor, but also deprives the entire freedom. Therefore, when I first went to work as an apprentice in a store, I was already trembling and wanted to avoid this kind of</p>
<h3 id="e215">Rice Market Reaches Peak Season, Then Declines <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over fifty boats arrived, but sales in this street were not good. The opening prices of various goods had limited fluctuations. Sales of Changshu-Wuxi North Non-glutinous rice felt sluggish, while high-priced rice was weak. The Shanghai-Tongxiang variety held steady. The overall market only saw minor activity from rural residents and small merchants. There is still a large inventory of early and late rice. Out-of-town merchants were interested in inquiring about higher-quality rice, and the situation was stable. The price of Yinyuan rice remained unchanged. The "Shuailuo" (a brand) was selling at three "chi".</p>
<p>(New Zhabei) Yesterday, over thirty boats arrived from various regions, but market sales slumped. Trading of North Non-glutinous rice was not active, and the market was flat. The price of foreign Dujian rice had been rising sharply for several days. However, because arrivals were scarce, the price decreased slightly. The sales of early and late rice were average. Similar to the thick Non-glutinous rice, the trend was stable. The sales of "Bianyuan" brand products were sluggish, and arrivals were not abundant, presenting a steady situation.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Foreign Rice Sales Stagnant, Prices Decline <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Lower Small Rice by Two Cents; Foreign Rice Weakens by Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign rice continued to be weak. As the supply of foreign rice continued to arrive, sales remained sluggish, and inventories gradually increased. Recently, the Southern merchant group is adopting a wait-and-see attitude, due to the impending implementation of river rice circulation. The Northern merchant group has completely halted operations. From now on, they will only pay attention to river Non-glutinous rice. This street no longer has any interest, and the market price immediately started to fall. Sellers are also willing to lower prices to sell off their inventory. Customers have begun to inquire due to the lower prices. In the general market, 320 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice from Fuzhou and Quanzhou were sold at a price of 7.9 yuan, and 200 bags of machine-milled oil rice were sold at a price of 8.75 to 8.78 yuan, both slightly higher than the previous day by more than five cents. This street sold 150 bags of Xiaojiao rice at a price of 7.6 yuan, which was two cents lower.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3 id="e217">Wuxi Stores Silk Cocoons, Transports to Shanghai for Sales <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the silk market in foreign firms has continued to decline. The economic recession in Europe and the United States, coupled with the encroachment of Japanese silk and artificial silk, has led to a slump in Chinese silk sales. Telegrams from white silk factories all complain about the high prices and refuse to buy. Silk merchants have been accumulating silk stocks and lack the funds to turn over. The situation is difficult to maintain. Wuxi is the central area for silk cocoons. There are a total of 50 silk factories in the county. After the new cocoons were launched this year, more than 20 factories started production. Due to the increasingly sluggish silk sales, closures have followed. Currently, only 13 factories are barely operating. Dried cocoons are not being inquired about. As the end of the year approaches, cocoon merchants are transporting stored cocoons to Shanghai for sale. As a result, nearly 4,000 "dan" of cocoons have been transported to Shanghai in the past month.</p>

<p>Yesterday, "Zhenmei" recorded tea from Luzhuang, English firms, and Jinlong, Tongfu, Baochang and Yishi (洋行名) Foreign Firms all started trading activiely with brisk transactions and a stable market. Needle tea and pearl tea also had scattered sales. The green tea market has a momentum for gradual movement, but Qining black tea, English and Russian merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach, and sales are stagnant.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e219">Hankou Asphalt Continues to Drop in Price <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Since asphalt prices fell in Hankou, sales in this port remain sluggish. However, the Zhejiang region, conversely, is experiencing a supply shortage. Market conditions are moving in opposite directions to those of Hankou. This is due to differing conditions across regions. According to telegrams from Hankou, market prices have fallen further. According to Chongjing, the opening price was 12 taels. Tianjin City's price was only 11 taels. Prices are falling rapidly, and the situation is like a burst dam. However, Zhejiang oil remains strong. The phenomenon of prices rising in the south while falling in the north goes against common sense. However, Zhejiang oil only affects a small area, unlike the broad coverage of the Hankou market. Furthermore, the market in this port usually follows Hankou's lead. Therefore, even if Zhejiang oil has momentum, it will not be affected, and the selling price will still fall according to Hankou's market. This may stimulate sales and allow circulation into Zhejiang Province.</p>
<h3 id="e220">White Tung Oil Gradually Stabilizes <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of white tung oil at Hankou Foreign Firms reached 17.78 taels, transactions have been intermittent and unpredictable. According to details from yesterday's Hankou letter, there is a significant supply, leading to a weak market. Traders are selling for only 13.4 taels in foreign silver. Local firms previously bought a batch of futures from Hangzhou traders, ranging from 23.34 yuan to 22.67 yuan per "shi". Now, due to the decline in the Hankou market, although Zhejiang Province can still maintain its position, the enthusiasm of buyers is not as strong as before. Therefore, they have gradually adopted a wait-and-see attitude recently. However, according to various producing areas, sellers are unwilling to sell at too low prices due to cost considerations. As a result, Zhejiang tung oil seems to be in a stable state. Although Hankou prices have fallen, sales have not been stimulated. Further price drops are unlikely, and the time for a turnaround has not yet arrived. A period of stability can still be expected.</p>

<p>Due to the winter season, sales of raincoat fabric are sluggish, but prices are still stable. Foreign Firms have very few inventories, so they can maintain the current situation. Yesterday, the wholesale price of ordinary rubber-coated raincoat fabric was 2.75 taels. The top grade of "Yuanchang" gray elephant skin lining raincoat fabric was 3 taels, the second grade was 2.75 taels, the top grade of "4026" brand water-repellent fabric was 3.8 taels, and the top grade of single-sided water-repellent fabric was 3.7 taels. The second grade ranged from 3.12 taels to 3.56 taels.</p>
