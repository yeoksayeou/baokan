<p>時評</p>
<h3>從上海恐怖說到遠東和平</h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>自從去年九一八東北禍變以後有人即預料上海有如一座火藥庫有立時爆發的可能果然這火藥庫現在是已經爆發了從上月二十八以至目前這極其危險的燃燒與爆裂正朝着非常恐怖的悲境推并進并擴大很顯然的被燃燒着的不僅是首當其衝的中國就整個世界而觀察却正是爆發太平洋上戰禍的一根引綫換言之即是破壞遠東和平的制命的一刀其危機實較之去年九一八所爆發的東北禍變尤爲嚴重</p>
<p>爆發這火藥庫的砲手無疑義的自然是日本帝國主義者所以日本帝國主義者與其說是中國的仇人母寗說是世界的公敵世界各國爲消弭迫害全人類的戰禍而在國際聨盟軍縮會議諸集會中焦慮討論而日本帝國主、義者的砲艦與大隊的海陸空軍正自東京向着上海進行殘酷的屠殺公然毫無顧　向全世界挑釁又是何等的大膽呵</p>
<p>當　日帝國主義者這種大膽的殘暴行爲不是偶然的它是由於整個世界的　景氣及其本身特殊的嚴重危機所激成先天的澆薄與後天的虧僓是日本帝國主義者生相特别兇殘的重要原因處於日暮途窮的恐慌悲境而加緊對弱小民族的侵凌與掠奪以企圖延長其殘喘那是必然的結果然而日帝國主義者向中國加緊侵略果能减輕其恐慌延長其日瀕危亡的壽命嗎事實上恐爲不可能的幻夢日言論界的權威者室伏高信氏於日本强佔東省之後著有满蒙論一書曾說「日本軍費大正元年爲一億地元最近爲二億三四千萬元再加以海軍計每年爲五億元積極政策直接的結果</p>
<p>第一爲日本在满洲須有較今日更多的軍隊第二爲朝鮮須有較今日更多的軍隊第三爲日本須特别對陸軍加以充實」我們且不言對華積極侵略將日益加緊列强間之尖稅對立使日帝國主義者恢復其繁榮的幻夢永難實現就是如上室伏所說鉅大軍費額的增加已足使日本人民負担日益加重日益貧困化市塲日益縮小日益走上破落之途了</p>
<p>爲不景氣所苦悶的不只是日本一國整個世界都是這樣以戰爭解决矛盾第一次世界便是這樣爆發的這一次當然也不能例外太平洋上刻正波詭雲譎大有山雨欲來風满樓的形勢遠東的和平已瀕於十分險惡的悲境如果日本臨到最後關頭再不覺悟則可怖的事件爆發即在目前至多不過進行的路程多經過幾次紆迴曲折罷了</p>

<h3>吳淞昨日戰况</h3>
<p>海空軍前日猛攻吳淞砲如失敗、被我砲台擊沉日驅逐艦一艘、擊傷戰艦三艘、擊落飛機一架、昨日日海軍司令部復派大批軍艦圍攻吳淞砲台、自晨九時起迄下午五時始止、我軍應戰極力、日艦二艘受傷、始終未能越雷池一步、茲據本報調查所得、詳誌於下、</p>
<p>敵艦圍攻本報駐淞記者、昨晚來館報告云、吳淞於昨日上午九時許、復有敵艦十三艘、圍攻砲台、要塞司令部振銓、當即督率官兵、發砲還擊、雙方互轟、頗爲劇烈、直至十一時許、敵艦二艘被我浦東龍王廟砲台夾攻、擊傷甚重、失去戰鬭力、遂與未受傷之餘艦、同時退出砲台火線之外、及至正午零時三十分、敵艦復大舉來攻、砲火較前更爲猛烈、并有敵海軍陸戰隊分頭在寳山城北、及砲台灣車站前洋碼頭、由敵艦砲火掩護登岸、希圖截擊砲台陸正面經要塞守備兵會同十九路軍、將敵擊退同時吳淞張華浜對江老鼠沙光華火油棧、被敵兵登岸、縱火擾亂後方、下午二時許、復有敵艦五艘、及敵機八九架、駛至淞口、加入作戰、一時砲台方面、砲聲連續不斷、聲震天地、敵兵又分數處海岸登陸、先後均被擊退、至五時許始行休戰、淞定居民業已遷避一空矣、</p>
<p>▲殲滅日軍昨晨九時起、日艦十三艘大舉攻我砲台、我軍奮勇還擊、雙方互戰約數小時後、我砲台忽然靜默、日艦繼續開砲、我方均無應聲、日急派偵察機飛至砲台附近窺視、亦以爲我軍全部退却砲台燬壞、遂以無線電報告、於是日艦陸戰隊紛紛登陸、迨逼近我砲台時、我方伏兵盡起、開砲痛擊、並以機關槍掃射、日陸戰隊千餘人盡被殲滅、無一生還</p>
<p>▲又一報告警備部報告云、四日上午、日軍派飛機四架、軍艦四艘、向我吳淞砲台轟擊、我方還砲、擊沉敵艦一隻、敵艦及飛機即不支逃去、至下午一時許、敵軍又來飛機三架、戰艦四艘、攻擊我砲台、激戰至三時許、我方即停止還砲、佯作不抵抗、敵艦以爲我方已退走、遂派陸戰隊一千餘名登岸、意圖直取砲台、我方守軍、靜待敵軍進砲台附近時、遂用機關槍及迫擊砲掃射、敵軍逃避不及、當被我軍擊斃千餘名、幾無一名生還、又據報白龍港海面、原有日艦八艘、但四日來攻吳淞砲台以後、僅有六艘、回至該處海面停泊、</p>
<p>▲赴淞指揮日海空軍連日犯我吳淞砲台、我軍奮勇還擊、激戰至烈、昨日下午三時、淞滬警備司令部並派七十八師副師長譚啓秀前往吳淞、負責指揮一切、要塞區域仍在我軍固守中、</p>
<p>▲鄧氏表示吳淞要塞司令鄧振銓、昨對各界表示云、此次暴日希圖侵佔閘北、經十九路軍奮勇抵抗、日軍挫敗後、英美領事爲避免戰禍擴大、刻正從事調解、詎日艦忽又來淞口挑釁、首先發砲、向我砲台轟擊、本人爲保守疆土之長官、豈容敵艦侵犯、當下令還擊、誓死抵抗、且我各砲官兵早具最大之决心、雖剩一砲一彈、决與要塞共存共亡云、</p>
<p>▲吳淞損害昨日吳淞激戰結果、我軍傷亡極少、日艦共開數百砲吳淞鎭</p>
<p>街市砲彈落下甚多、被轟燬者計有明遠樓茶餘·協茂福醬園·盛慶福藥材店·漢和理髮店等數家、損害尙輕、</p>
<p>▲特别戒嚴吳淞要塞司令部鄧振銓、於昨夜宣布淞口特别戒嚴、自晚間七時至翌晨五時、一切船隻不准進出、</p>
<h3>閘北昨日戰况</h3>
<p>日兵於三日下令總攻擊後、當日首先一仗、即被我軍予以重創乃日兵尙不甘服、遽於昨日繼續不舉分三路進攻、幸賴我軍奮勇抵抗卒將日兵擊敗、並同時奪獲戰利品等、茲將閘北方面我軍擊潰三路進犯日兵情形分誌如下、</p>
<p>乘勝追擊福生路係接近老靶子路、日兵自從北河南路口撤退後、即集中在該處、以儉德儲蓄會爲根據地、曾屢次由新民路向寳山路襲擊、昨晨五時許、該處日兵、首向寳山路口進攻、當爲防守北車站路我軍抵住、雙方即在該處交戰、未幾日兵見無發展、乃即用機關槍向我方掃射、我方亦即還擊、同時日兵有踞登該處商牆上用鋼砲向下猛攻、因此北站左右、彈如雨下、血肉横飛約相戰四小時、我軍在猛抗之下、卒將日兵挫敗乃乘勝追擊、至虬江路與我軍中路綫會合、守住原防日兵沿北四川路南北敗退、日兵死傷者約百餘人、界路上亦有日軍陳屍、</p>
<p>▲截獲軍械日兵於進攻寳山路後、一面即分兵向塘山路衝入東寳興路、其勢異常猛烈、但我軍早有準備、即奮勇抵抗、日兵曾爲少挫、未幾日兵續有大隊來攻、先用大砲掩護繼以迫擊砲·機關頭痛擊、相持約六小時、我中路軍抽派勁旅、沿淞滬綫超越至日兵後路夾擊、日兵始漸不支正擬向後退却、奈後路阻塞、乃被我軍包圍、日兵屢次奪圍、終未得逞、後得援軍之助、乃始解圍、然生還者無幾、此處我方截獲日兵大砲七門、機槍十七架、槍彈無數、日兵傷亡者約三百餘人、我軍亦受輕傷、總計日軍昨日終日共發四百餘砲、</p>
<p>▲左翼激戰昨日日兵進攻各路中最猛烈、者厥爲江灣路及靑雲路、以此路日兵司令部適在該處、而又當虹口咽喉、故日兵出全力以搏、而我軍以此路實擊中右兩路陣綫、亦極力抵抗、於是此處、乃成兩方戰爭焦點相搏之烈、爲日軍向我開釁後之第一次、沿淞滬綫天通庵路日兵、曾有十餘次在大砲掩護之下、向我軍防綫作至猛之衝鋒、我軍出壘抵抗、甚至肉搏、迫擊砲機關槍、幾失效用、日軍後方、乃在虹口花園及六三花園、用大砲向我軍後方陣地射擊、冀圖擾亂、我軍亦即用砲向日軍各砲位及該司令部轟擊、均能中的、日司令部内及附近、曾中彈十餘次、惟惜未爆發耳、在午後一時許、停在北站車塲内之我軍鐵甲車一列、亦奉命前調助戰、該車即衝至淞滬綫、在寳山路站東發砲、當將六三花園轟毁、殲滅日兵百餘人、當時前綫日兵傷亡已將過半、又見後方援助隊伍發生劇變、乃節節敗退、我軍即在該處守住、並分兵至六三花園一帶追擊潰兵、聞我義勇軍一部、已推進至嘉興路、一部已佔領狄思威路一帶、此方日兵死亡達五百餘人、我軍亦受創傷、義勇軍方面、陣亡排長郭成標一名、傷士兵邱一峯·楊林孚·二名、當由紅十字會救護車送入醫院、</p>
<p>▲日機擲彈在昨晨繼續發生戰事時、日飛機二架、於十時左右、又復起飛助戰、先在閘北一帶盤繞、因我軍用高射砲斷續轟擊、因此未有投擲炸彈、約半小時後、日飛機忽然下降投彈、計先後不下三十餘次、以致南自寳山路鴻興路、北至靑雲路西寳興路八寺橋一帶民房工廠、多爲日軍砲彈及炸彈擊燬、着火延燒、八寺橋之玻璃廠、貧民收容所、已成燎原、自上午十時至下午十二時、延燒終日、尙未熄滅、一時紅光燭天、烟火满佈、損失甚爲鉅重、同時開封路更新舞臺後、亦被日機擲彈爆炸起火、自下午三時起至九時許、尙未熄滅、以地在軍事區域、竟無法施救、一任延燒、至爲慘酷、并此次日方均利用大砲、故先後計發砲達四百餘砲、中間曾有十餘次係空砲、我方還砲甚爲準確、至於迫擊砲·機關槍·小鋼砲、則不計其數、總之自晨五時至下午五時、十二小時中槍砲聲疏密不斷、足證此役之劇烈、</p>
<p>今晨砲戰北閘方面戰事、昨日入晚後、砲聲已停、槍聲亦少、至九時以大砲抵抗日艦之鄧夺銓司令</p>
<p>後更覺平靜、詎至今晨零時三十分、敵軍方面、突又開砲向我軍陣地轟擊、我軍亦開砲還擊、頓時砲聲隆隆、震動天地、而機關槍聲及來福槍聲、亦同時不絕於耳、激戰至零五十分時、砲聲稍停、至一時許、槍聲亦停、自一時至一時半之間、、機關槍復又繼續發放惟不甚激烈細察槍砲</p>
<p>聲地點、似仍在淞滬鐵路一帶、</p>

<h3>本市金融穩定</h3>

<p>歐美軍人觀戰</p>
<h3>驚歎我軍神勇</h3>
<p>▲聲喊殺向砲火衝去</p>
<p>▲昨午江灣路血戰一般</p>
<p>昨晚據西人方面傳出一可喜消息、略謂此次日軍向華軍挑戰、日方早出驕矜誇大之詞、曾謂華軍不値一擊、日軍於數小時内即可佔領上海全埠、不料事出意外、日軍運戰皆北、日當局更憤愧欲死、於是惱羞成怒、遂不惜孤注一擲、竟於昨日（三日）竭海陸空全軍之力、向吳淞砲台及閘北方面大舉進攻、但効力更等於零、且全軍大受重創日艦一沉四傷、此種消息傳出後、不獨華人聞之悲喜交集、即外人方面、亦同時感到愉快、於是留滬歐美各軍事家、乃組織一戰地觀察團、紛往前線陣地觀察、昨午觀抵江灣路、適該處戰事正烈、日軍以大批野砲及機槍向我軍防線猛攻、我軍初僅回砲還擊、旣見日軍發砲勢若聨珠、我軍防禦物被燬數處、此時華軍非獨不退、反一聲喊殺、面迎如雨之砲彈方面、衝鋒而出前仆後繼、勢如潮湧結果日軍大亂、紛紛丢槍棄砲而逃、是役華軍共奪得機槍十七挺、野砲七門、步槍子彈無數、然所受犧牲亦鉅、惟當華軍衝鋒時、不獨日軍望風披靡、旁觀者亦且驚心昨舌、悉認爲此種犧牲精神、即歐洲大戰中亦所罕見也、觀此、則日軍最初數小時佔領全滬之夢想、殆已完全打破矣、</p>

<p>、蓋其行動、已使市政停頓、居民驚恐、甚至工部局之巡捕及看門巡捕竟被繳械、不能行其職權、救火隊服制服工作隊隊員、又受妨碍及攻擊、而食品之運送及醫院事務、皆因日本海軍及便衣隊之妨害、致生重大困難、故請其立即向日本當道交涉云、</p>

<h3>From the Shanghai Terror to Far Eastern Peace</h3>
<p>By Bin</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Northeast Incident last year, some have predicted that Shanghai is like a powder keg, ready to explode at any moment. Sure enough, this powder keg has now exploded. From the 28th of last month to the present, this extremely dangerous burning and explosion is advancing and expanding towards a very terrifying and tragic situation. It is very clear that what is being burned is not only China, which bears the brunt, but when viewed from the perspective of the entire world, it is precisely the fuse that ignites the war in the Pacific. In other words, it is the knife that destroys the fate of peace in the Far East. Its crisis is even more serious than the Northeast Incident that broke out on September 18th last year.</p>
<p>The gunners who detonated this powder keg are undoubtedly the Japanese imperialists. Therefore, the Japanese imperialists are more accurately described as the common enemy of the world than as China's enemy. All countries in the world are anxiously discussing in the League of Nations disarmament conference and other gatherings in order to eliminate the war that persecutes all mankind. However, the Japanese imperialists' gunboats and large armies of land, sea, and air forces are conducting cruel massacres from Tokyo towards Shanghai, openly and recklessly provoking the world. How daring is that!</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialists' bold and brutal behavior is not accidental. It is stimulated by the overall global economic downturn and its own unique and severe crisis. Innate thinness and acquired defects are important reasons for the Japanese imperialists' particularly fierce appearance. It is inevitable that they will intensify their invasion and plunder of weak nations in an attempt to prolong their dying breath in a state of panic and tragedy as they approach their end. However, can the Japanese imperialists' intensification of aggression against China really alleviate their panic and prolong their life that is on the verge of death? In fact, it may be an impossible dream. Mr. Murofushi Takanobu, an authority in the Japanese media, wrote a book called "Manchuria and Mongolia" after Japan forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces, saying, "Japan's military expenditure was 100 million yuan in the first year of the Taisho era, and recently it has been 234 million yuan. Adding the navy, it is 500 million yuan per year. The direct result of the proactive policy is:</p>
<p>First, Japan must have more troops in Manchuria than it does today. Second, Korea must have more troops than it does today. Third, Japan must especially strengthen its army." Let us not say that the increasingly intensified proactive aggression against China will make the sharp confrontation between the powers increasingly intensified, making the Japanese imperialists' dream of restoring their prosperity impossible to realize forever. Just as Murofushi said above, the increase in huge military expenditures is enough to make the Japanese people's burden increasingly heavy and increasingly impoverished, and the market is shrinking day by day, increasingly heading towards ruin.</p>
<p>It is not only Japan that is suffering from the economic downturn; the entire world is like this. The First World War broke out in this way to resolve contradictions. This time, of course, is no exception. The Pacific Ocean is currently turbulent and unpredictable, with a storm brewing. The peace of the Far East is on the verge of a very dangerous tragedy. If Japan does not wake up at the last moment, then the outbreak of terrible events is imminent, at most, the journey will only go through a few more twists and turns.</p>

<p>More Than Half of the Marines Killed or Wounded, Fortress Untouched</p>
<p>Fierce Battle in Zhabei, Japanese Army Fires More Than 400 Shells</p>
<p>Our Army Also Returns Fire, Japanese Army Retreats in Defeat</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>The naval and air forces launched a fierce attack on the Wusong Fort the day before, failing and being sunk by our fort with one Japanese destroyer, three warships damaged, and one plane shot down. Yesterday, the Japanese Naval Headquarters sent a large number of warships to surround and attack the Wusong Fort again, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Our army responded with all its strength, and two Japanese warships were injured, and they never crossed the Lei Chi pool one step. According to the investigation by this newspaper, the details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Surround and Attack, Our Newspaper's Reporter Stationed in Song reported to the museum last night that around 9:00 AM yesterday, there were 13 enemy warships surrounding the fort again. The fortress commander, Zhen Quan, immediately supervised the officers and soldiers to fire back. The two sides exchanged fire fiercely. Until around 11:00 AM, two enemy warships were attacked by our Pudong Longwang Temple Fort, severely damaged, and lost their fighting ability. They retreated from the fort's firing line with the remaining undamaged ships. At 0:30 noon, the enemy warships launched a large-scale attack again, with more intense artillery fire than before. Enemy Marines also landed separately in the north of Baoshan City and at the Yang Wharf in front of the Baotai Railway Station, covered by enemy warship artillery fire, hoping to intercept the fort from the land. After the fortress garrison troops joined forces with the 19th Route Army, they repelled the enemy. At the same time, the Laoshusha Guanghua Oil Depot across the river from Zhang Huabang in Wusong was landed by enemy soldiers, setting fire to disrupt the rear. Around 2:00 PM, five enemy warships and eight or nine enemy planes sailed to Songkou and joined the battle. For a time, the artillery fire on the fort side was continuous, shaking the sky. Enemy soldiers landed on the coast in several places and were repelled one after another. A ceasefire was only reached around 5:00 PM. The residents of Songding have already moved away completely.</p>
<p>▲Annihilation of Japanese Army Starting at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, 13 Japanese warships launched a large-scale attack on our fort. Our army fought bravely, and the two sides fought for several hours. Suddenly, our fort became silent. The Japanese warships continued to fire, but there was no response from our side. The Japanese urgently sent reconnaissance planes to fly near the fort to spy, also believing that our army had completely retreated and the fort was destroyed. Therefore, they reported by radio. As a result, the Japanese Marines landed one after another. When they approached our fort, our ambush soldiers rose up and fired fiercely, and swept with machine guns. More than a thousand Japanese Marines were annihilated, and none survived.</p>
<p>▲Another Report The Garrison Department reported that on the 4th, the Japanese army sent four planes and four warships to bombard our Wusong Fort. Our side returned fire, sinking one enemy ship. The enemy ships and planes could not support it and fled. Around 1:00 PM, the enemy army sent three planes and four warships again to attack our fort. After a fierce battle until around 3:00 PM, our side stopped returning fire, pretending not to resist. The enemy ships thought that our side had retreated, so they sent more than a thousand Marines to land, intending to directly capture the fort. Our defending soldiers quietly waited for the enemy army to approach the fort, and then used machine guns and mortars to sweep. The enemy army could not escape and was killed by our army for more than a thousand people, and almost no one survived. It was also reported that there were originally eight Japanese warships in the Bailonggang sea area, but after attacking the Wusong Fort on the 4th, only six ships returned to the sea area and docked there.</p>
<p>▲Going to Song for Command The Japanese naval and air forces have been attacking our Wusong Fort for days, and our army has fought bravely and fiercely. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Garrison Command also sent Tan Qixiu, the deputy commander of the 78th Division, to Wusong to be responsible for commanding everything. The fortress area is still firmly guarded by our army.</p>
<p>▲Deng Expresses Wusong Fortress Commander Deng Zhenquan expressed to all sectors yesterday that this time the violent Japanese army hoped to invade Zhabei. After the 19th Route Army bravely resisted, the Japanese army was defeated. The British and American consuls are mediating to avoid the expansion of the war. Unexpectedly, the Japanese warships suddenly came to Songkou to provoke, first firing and bombarding our fort. I, as the chief of guarding the territory, how can I allow enemy ships to invade? I immediately ordered a counterattack and vowed to resist to the death. Moreover, all our artillery officers and soldiers have long had the greatest determination, and even if there is only one cannon and one bullet left, we will coexist and die with the fortress.</p>
<p>▲Wusong Damage As a result of the fierce battle in Wusong yesterday, our army suffered very few casualties. Japanese warships fired hundreds of shells. Many shells fell on the streets of Wusong Town. Those destroyed by bombing include Mingyuanlou Teahouse, Xie Maofu Sauce Garden, Sheng Qingfu Pharmacy, Hanhe Barber Shop, etc., but the damage is still light.</p>
<p>▲Special Martial Law Wusong Fortress Commander Deng Zhenquan announced special martial law in Songkou last night. From 7:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning, all ships were not allowed to enter or leave.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Zhabei Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the Japanese soldiers issued a general attack order on the 3rd, the first battle of the day was severely damaged by our army. However, the Japanese soldiers were still unwilling to accept and continued to attack in three routes yesterday. Fortunately, our army fought bravely and finally defeated the Japanese soldiers, and at the same time captured spoils of war, etc. The situation of our army defeating the Japanese soldiers who invaded in three routes in Zhabei is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Take Advantage of the Victory to Pursue Fusheng Road is close to Laobazi Road. After the Japanese soldiers retreated from the North Henan Road intersection, they concentrated there, using the Jiande Savings Society as a base. They repeatedly attacked Baoshan Road from Xinmin Road. Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese soldiers there first attacked the Baoshan Road intersection. They were resisted by our army defending the North Railway Station Road, and the two sides fought there. Before long, the Japanese soldiers saw that there was no development, so they used machine guns to sweep at our side. Our side also returned fire. At the same time, the Japanese soldiers occupied the walls of the business there and used steel cannons to attack downwards. Therefore, around the North Railway Station, bullets rained down and flesh and blood flew. After fighting for about four hours, our army defeated the Japanese soldiers under fierce resistance and took advantage of the victory to pursue them to Qiujiang Road, where they joined our central route line and guarded the original defense. The Japanese soldiers retreated north and south along North Sichuan Road. About a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and Japanese soldiers were also found dead on the boundary road.</p>
<p>▲Intercept Military Equipment After the Japanese soldiers attacked Baoshan Road, they immediately divided their troops and rushed into Dongbaoxing Road through Tangshan Road, with extraordinary momentum. However, our army was prepared early and fought bravely. The Japanese soldiers were slightly frustrated. Before long, the Japanese soldiers continued to attack with a large force, first using artillery fire to cover, followed by mortar and machine gun head-on attacks. After a stalemate of about six hours, our central route army dispatched elite troops, crossed the Songhu Line to the rear of the Japanese soldiers and attacked from both sides. The Japanese soldiers gradually became unable to support it and were about to retreat backwards, but the rear road was blocked, and they were surrounded by our army. The Japanese soldiers repeatedly tried to break through the encirclement, but failed in the end. They were only relieved with the help of reinforcements, but few survived. Here, our side intercepted seven Japanese artillery pieces, 17 machine guns, and countless bullets. About 300 Japanese soldiers were injured or killed. Our army also suffered minor injuries. In total, the Japanese army fired more than 400 shells throughout the day yesterday.</p>
<p>▲Fierce Battle on the Left Wing Yesterday, the most fierce attack by the Japanese soldiers on all routes was on Jiangwan Road and Qingyun Road. Because the Japanese military headquarters happened to be there on this road, and it was also the throat of Hongkou, the Japanese soldiers fought with all their strength. Our army also resisted with all its strength, because this road actually hit the right and left lines. Therefore, this place became the focus of the war between the two sides. The fierceness of the fight was the first time since the Japanese army started the war against us. The Japanese soldiers along the Songhu Line, Tiantong'an Road, had more than ten charges on our army's defense line under the cover of artillery fire. Our army resisted out of the fortress, even engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Mortars and machine guns were almost ineffective. The Japanese army's rear fired artillery at our army's rear positions in the Hongkou Garden and the 63 Garden, hoping to disrupt them. Our army also used artillery to bombard the Japanese army's artillery positions and the headquarters, all of which were accurate. The Japanese headquarters and its vicinity were hit by shells more than ten times, but unfortunately they did not explode. At around 1:00 PM, a train of armored vehicles of our army stationed in the North Railway Station train yard was also ordered to be transferred to help the battle. The train rushed to the Songhu Line and fired at the east of the Baoshan Road Station, destroying the 63 Garden and annihilating more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. At that time, more than half of the Japanese soldiers on the front line had been injured or killed, and seeing that the rear support team had undergone drastic changes, they retreated in defeat. Our army guarded there and divided its troops to pursue the defeated soldiers in the 63 Garden area. It was heard that a part of our volunteer army had advanced to Jiaxing Road, and a part had occupied the Disiwei Road area. The number of Japanese soldiers killed in this area reached more than 500, and our army also suffered injuries. In the volunteer army, squad leader Guo Chengbiao was killed in action, and soldiers Qiu Yifeng and Yang Linfu were injured. They were sent to the hospital by the Red Cross ambulance.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Planes Dropping Bombs When the battle continued yesterday morning, two Japanese planes took off again to help the battle at around 10:00 AM. They first circled around Zhabei. Because our army used anti-aircraft guns to bombard intermittently, they did not drop bombs. About half an hour later, the Japanese planes suddenly descended and dropped bombs, no less than thirty times in total. As a result, civilian houses and factories from Baoshan Road Hongxing Road in the south to Qingyun Road Xibaoxing Road Basi Bridge in the north were mostly destroyed by Japanese artillery shells and bombs, catching fire and spreading. The glass factory and the poor people's shelter in Basi Bridge have become a prairie fire, burning from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and have not been extinguished all day. For a time, the red light illuminated the sky, and smoke and fire filled the air, causing huge losses. At the same time, the Hougengxin Stage on Kaifeng Road was also bombed and set on fire by Japanese planes, burning from 3:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and has not been extinguished. Because the area is in a military zone, there is no way to rescue it, and it is allowed to burn, which is extremely tragic. In addition, the Japanese side used artillery in this battle, so a total of more than 400 shells were fired. Among them, there were more than ten times when they were empty shells. Our side returned fire very accurately. As for mortars, machine guns, and small steel cannons, they were countless. In short, from 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM, the sound of guns and cannons was constant, which proves the intensity of this battle.</p>
<p>Cannon Battle This Morning The fighting in the North Gate area had ceased after nightfall yesterday, and the sound of gunfire was also low. Commander Deng Duoquan, who resisted Japanese warships with artillery at 9:00, felt even more calm. Unexpectedly, at 0:30 this morning, the enemy army suddenly opened fire and bombarded our army's positions. Our army also opened fire and returned fire. Suddenly, the sound of cannons rumbled, shaking the earth, and the sound of machine guns and rifles was also endless at the same time. The fierce battle stopped slightly at 0:50. Around 1:00, the sound of gunfire also stopped. From 1:00 to 1:30, machine guns continued to fire again, but not very fiercely. After carefully examining the location of the guns and cannons, it seemed that they were still in the Songhu Railway area.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Information from Various Sources</h3>
<p>Two Shells Hit the Japanese Army's Key Points The Great American Evening Post said that according to Japanese sources at noon today (the 4th), the Japanese sentries at 63 Garden Jiangwan Road are now surrounded by a large team of Chinese soldiers, and there is a risk of annihilation. The representative of the Great American Evening Post was on the lower floor of the officers' club of the Japanese Naval Headquarters on North Sichuan Road this morning when the watchman on the roof suddenly issued a warning signal. In a blink of an eye, a shell fired by a Chinese soldier landed outside the wall, and the courtyard shook violently. If this shell had exploded, today's battle on both sides of the Songhu Railway would not have occurred. There was also a shell, I don't know whether it was fired by Chinese soldiers or Japanese soldiers, landed behind the swimming pool, about 100 yards away from the Japanese headquarters, and immediately caught fire. In this morning's battle, the Japanese side used all the troops it could mobilize to rush to the defense zone between Tiantong Road and Douluo'an Road, and there were armored vehicles with machine guns to cover the gap in the railway on Tiantong Road. From 7:15 AM to noon, Japanese soldiers used eight field guns to fire more than 200 shells. The Chinese soldiers' artillery fire was concentrated on the Japanese headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road and the Japanese school on that road. This morning, a small field gun has been erected on the roof of the school.</p>
<p>▲A Large Group of Planes Came to Shanghai to Help The military authorities here received a report from Nanjing yesterday that two large groups of fighter planes have been sent to Shanghai today to assist the 19th Route Army in combat.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Lieutenant General Will Arrive in Shanghai According to foreign sources yesterday, the Japanese government, because the naval, land, and air forces in Shanghai have repeatedly failed, has ordered the dispatch of the Third Fleet, led by Lieutenant General Hirao Juhachiro, to Shanghai for combat. They are expected to arrive today or tomorrow, and it is stipulated that all land and air forces in Shanghai will be under Hirao's command.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Military Camps in the Concession It is reported that the San Yuan Temple on Dong Wuchang Road, Hongkou, is now occupied by 500 Japanese soldiers. It is also heard that there is a Japanese ammunition depot in the Mitsui Building at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Fujian Road. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, there were three trucks full of ammunition and other items, hired a Russian driver and four or five Japanese ronin to escort the vehicles, and drove north.</p>
<p>▲US Army Drives Japanese Army Out of Gordon Road A team of Japanese soldiers is stationed at the Japanese Army Headquarters north of Gordon Road. The US Army stationed in Shanghai, in view of the Japanese army's forcible occupation of the concession area, provocation and searching, aroused the dissatisfaction of the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai. Driven by indignation, more than 100 US troops went to the Japanese Army Headquarters north of Gordon Road at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, ordering the garrison to withdraw. The Japanese army did not resist and immediately left the headquarters.</p>
<p>Wireless Talent Urgently Needed The Chinese Wireless Engineering School on Aidao Road has recently been informed that the military department urgently needs many wireless talents. All graduates of the school are requested to contact them as soon as possible so that they can be sent to the front line to serve. Guo Taiqi Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<h3>To Handle Shanghai Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The National Government believes that the Japanese army in Shanghai is attacking our army's positions based on the concession, and our army is making legitimate resistance for self-defense. Moreover, the four countries of Britain, the United States, Italy, and France are also mediating and advocating the establishment of a neutral zone. Therefore, diplomatic matters are very important and it seems that there must be senior officials in charge. Foreign Vice Minister Guo Taiqi was specially sent to Shanghai to be responsible for handling everything. Guo arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Local Maintenance Association Asks</p>
<h3>19th Route Army for Help</h3>
<p>▲Three Million Citizens Eagerly Await Reply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Maintenance Association sent a telegram to the National Government, saying: "Chairman Lin of the Luoyang National Government, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Minister He Jingzhi of the Nanjing Military and Political Department, and Minister Luo Junren of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The 19th Route Army has been fighting bloody battles for days, and various public groups have repeatedly telegraphed for assistance, but no reply has been received. The whole city is in panic. After the government issued an order for all armies to resist, what methods of assistance are there for the isolated army in Shanghai? The three million citizens of Shanghai are now on the verge of desperation. Without Shanghai, there is no whole country. To abandon the 19th Route Army without assistance is not only to abandon our three million citizens. May I ask, if the country loses this economic center, how will it support itself in the future? We urgently await a reply." Shi Liangcai, Chairman of the Shanghai Citizens Local Maintenance Association, Wang Xiaolai, Vice Chairman, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Lin, Du Yuesheng, Qin Runqing, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Yinjiang, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Xinliu, Qian Xinzhizhu Qinglan, Li Fuxun, Lu Bohong, Zhang Weiru, Huang Yanpei, Nie Lusheng, Feng Bingnan, Kui Yanfang, Sun Zhongli, Zha Liangzhao, Hu Yinan, Liu Jisheng, Yang Zhixiong, Zhu Boquan, Hu Yunqiu, Zou Bingwen, Hu Yunzhuang, Guo Bingwen, Hu Yunlai, Xu Jilun, Wang Boqi, Hu Bijiang, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, Hu Mengjia, Bei Songsun, Gu Fuqing, Mu Ouchu, Guo Le, Shen Laiqing, Tao Leqin, etc., kowtow.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Others Send a Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>▲Resistance Can Lead to Survival</p>
<p>Sun Ke and others sent a circular telegram, saying: "To all newspaper offices across the country, to all provincial and municipal governments, to all military organizations, and to all compatriots across the country: Since the violent Japanese army invaded our country, four months have passed in an instant. In these four months, our whole country has endured humiliation and sought survival in humiliation. In the end, we have not invited the country to be enlightened, and it has taken an inch and advanced a foot, and has once again invaded our Shanghai. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army and the loyalty and bravery of all armies are unyielding, swearing to resist the enemy and winning repeatedly. And we have the support of compatriots at home and abroad, and the hearts of the people across the country have been shaken, and the world's hearing has been turned around. In addition, the Japanese army's brutality, killing our unarmed people, women and children, is beyond counting. Transportation, culture, and education institutions have been reduced to ashes, and the regulations on breaking the alliance's defense have been used to occupy the safety of the concession. All kinds of atrocities are too numerous to mention, which has aroused the public indignation of compatriots and lost the sympathy of the world. There are ultimatums and warnings from the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, and our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its acceptance. It is heard that the Japanese side still wants to reinforce with the army for a final decisive battle. Its intention is that if Shanghai is lost, all countries will recognize that our country cannot be helped, and all assistance will be suspended because of this. And because the 19th Route Army and all armies in our country cannot support it, there will be no army in the future that dares to resist Japan, and our country will fall into a state of irreversible disaster. Therefore, today's corner of Shanghai is actually the key to the survival of our country. The resistance against Japan in Shanghai is not for Shanghai, but for the whole country. Since the alarm of Shanghai occurred, the government moved to Luoyang to plan resistance. The people of Shanghai witnessed the ferocity of the invaders, the hard battles of our army, and the unity of the people. It really made the comrades forget their weakness and participate in the struggle. After our army won repeatedly, people from all countries began to realize that there are still people in our country, and they paid attention to it. It is recorded in various newspapers and can be verified. The arrogance of the violent Japanese army has been greatly挫. The comrades are not sensitive, and they think that this is really an opportunity for our country to revive from death. If we do not rush to rise up, we will not be able to start a new situation and strive for survival. At this critical moment, I deeply hope that all compatriots across the country will unite and respond quickly to save the country from danger. Currently, Harbin is still holding on firmly, and the provincial capital of Jilin has been recovered. The people of the Northeast have also risen up. Yesterday, all banks in Shanghai opened, and there were very few withdrawals and cashing. This is really a sign of the unity of the hearts of the people in our country, and it is also a voucher for the survival of our country. I still hope that all compatriots across the country will work together to overcome this difficulty. I especially hope that our military comrades will learn from the situation in Shanghai and know that it is impossible to stand without resistance, and that resistance can lead to survival. Do not delay and sit idly by, causing the loss of opportunity, so that justice and humanity will be extended to the world one day. We earnestly express our words and respectfully ask for instructions."

<p>Various Industries</p>
<h3>Public Associations Urgently Telegraph for Help</h3>
<p>Our city's 115 industry associations, including the Intestine Industry Association, urgently telegraphed the National Government and the Military and Political Department for assistance yesterday, as the Japanese bandits are making every effort to attack our Wusong Zhabei. The original telegrams are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Telegram to the National Government The country is in urgent need. Chairman Lin of the Luoyang National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Committee Member Jiang of the National Government: Today, the Japanese bandits are determined to take Wusong with all their strength. If it is lost, Shanghai will be in danger, and the safety of Shanghai is related to the survival of the country. It seems difficult to stand idly by and watch the success or failure. We beg you to make a decisive decision and quickly send planes and a large army to Shanghai to help the battle and increase defense. The merchants of Shanghai vow to spare no sacrifice to be the backing of the country. An urgent telegram is submitted, and we hope that you will understand.

<p>▲Telegram to the Military and Political Department The country is in urgent need. Minister He of the Military and Political Department: Today, the Japanese bandits are determined to take our Wusong with all their strength. If it is lost, Shanghai will be in danger. If Shanghai is not defended, the country will perish. We beg you to make a decisive decision and quickly send planes and a large army to Shanghai to help the battle and protect the dangerous situation. Do not delay and wait and see, and lose the fortress. An urgent telegram is submitted, and the words are not chosen. The Shanghai Intestine Industry Association and 115 industry associations kowtow.</p>
<h3>Financial Stability in Our City</h3>
<p>▲ A Positive Phenomenon of Unity Against External Threats</p>
<p>▲ Short-Sighted Compradors Should Immediately Wake Up</p>
<p>Following the resolution passed at the Shanghai Bankers Association meeting, banks resumed operations yesterday (the 4th). All banks officially opened in the morning, and there were no restrictions on withdrawals for depositors. As a result, order was well-maintained. Due to ample preparations and a very solid foundation, all banks were able to cope easily. Banknotes continued to circulate as usual without any problems. This is a good phenomenon of national unity against external threats, with people's hearts gradually stabilizing. What is regrettable is that a few foreign banks still require cash transactions. In fact, most foreign businesses and the authorities of foreign banks deeply understand the outstanding creditworthiness of Chinese banknotes, which is no different from the past. Yesterday's phenomenon may have been caused by a misunderstanding on the part of a few compradores. If the senior Chinese staff of foreign banks can thoroughly explain the creditworthiness of banknotes to foreigners, so that they can be universally accepted, it would greatly benefit society and demonstrate their patriotism. After all, our army's resistance against Japan concerns the survival of the nation, and the most important things are the supply of the army and the stability of the rear. These two things depend entirely on financial stability. If we cannot unite, it is no different from helping the Japanese in their war effort. At this time of tense situation, people's every move has a great impact, and it is especially important to unite against external threats.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to reports, after the banks opened, the amount of deposits exceeded the amount of withdrawals, which is indicative of the overall social and economic situation and the people's determination to consolidate financial stability. The Shanghai Bankers Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) the other day, expressing its readiness to resume business. Yesterday, they received a reply from the SMC's Director-General, stating that the SMC strongly hopes that the banks and financial institutions will reopen immediately to allow financial circulation, restore public confidence, and avoid economic panic. The SMC has decided to dispatch police to protect all banks and warehouses, and to provide special vigilance in the banking district to maintain order and security. The SMC hopes that the Association will cooperate fully. It is believed that with the protection of the SMC, the banks will be able to resume business today or tomorrow, and so on.</p>
<p>European and American Military Observers Watch the Battle</p>
<h3>Awestruck by the Bravery of Our Troops</h3>
<p>▲ Shouting "Kill!" They Charge into the Cannon Fire</p>
<p>▲ Bloody Battle on Jiangwan Road Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>According to Western sources last night, the Japanese, who had been arrogant and boastful about challenging the Chinese army, claiming that the Chinese army was not worth a strike and that the Japanese army could occupy the entire Shanghai in a few hours, were unexpectedly defeated. The Japanese authorities were filled with anger and shame, and in a fit of rage, they recklessly made a desperate gamble. Yesterday (the 3rd), they launched a major offensive against the Wusong Fort and Zhabei areas with all their naval, land, and air forces. However, the effort was equal to zero, and the entire army suffered heavy losses, with one Japanese warship sunk and four damaged. This news was not only met with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy by the Chinese, but also with pleasure by the foreigners. European and American military experts in Shanghai organized a battlefield observation team and went to the front lines to observe. Yesterday afternoon, they arrived at Jiangwan Road, where the fighting was intense. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack on our defensive lines with a large number of field guns and machine guns. Our army initially only responded with artillery fire. Seeing that the Japanese artillery fire was like a string of pearls, and several sections of our defenses were destroyed, the Chinese army, far from retreating, let out a battle cry and charged out, facing the rain of artillery shells. They advanced wave upon wave, like a tide. As a result, the Japanese army was thrown into chaos, abandoning their guns and cannons and fleeing. In this battle, the Chinese army captured seventeen machine guns, seven field guns, and countless rifles and bullets. However, the sacrifices were also great. When the Chinese army charged, not only were the Japanese forces routed, but the onlookers were also shocked and speechless, all agreeing that such a spirit of sacrifice was rarely seen even in the European war. From this, it is clear that the Japanese dream of occupying all of Shanghai in the first few hours has been completely shattered.</p>

<p>Japanese Atrocities</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Protests</h3>
<p>▲ Letter to the Senior Consul</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) has sent a letter to the U.S. Consul-General, who is also the Senior Consul, stating that due to the significant impact of the actions of the Japanese Marines outside their assigned zone on the security of the Settlement, the SMC fully supports the protests of the Defense Committee and requests the U.S. Consul-General to lodge an urgent protest with the Japanese authorities. Chairman Macnaghten also asked the U.S. Consul-General to pay attention to the serious situation of armed Japanese soldiers and armed civilians operating in the northern and eastern districts, as their actions have disrupted municipal services, caused panic among residents, and even led to the disarmament of SMC constables and watchmen, preventing them from performing their duties. The transportation of food and hospital services has also been severely hindered by the interference of the Japanese Navy and plainclothes units. Therefore, he requested that the U.S. Consul-General immediately negotiate with the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Efforts of the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<h3>Restoring Police Authority in the Settlement</h3>
<p>▲ Cooperation between the Shanghai Municipal Council and Various National Authorities</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the Public Settlement Defense Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Council protested to the Japanese authorities on the 2nd of this month against the independent actions of the Japanese army within their assigned defense zone and the interference with the fire brigade and the police force in the performance of their duties. As of yesterday, no official reply had been received. However, the Japanese authorities had verbally promised to concentrate the plainclothes units of the Japanese Navy in places like the Japanese Elementary School, the post office, and the Qujiang Bridge police station, and to return the maintenance of order in other areas to the SMC police. However, as of yesterday afternoon, the Japanese side again claimed that the two sides had not ceased fire yesterday, and this plan could not be implemented immediately. They suggested that it be tried out in a small area starting today. The aforementioned protest letter was signed by Major General Macnaghten, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Major General Fleming, Commander of the British Forces; Colonel Hawke, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps; Colonel Tomiath, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps; and Major Kidd, Chief of Police. It is also reported that Rear Admiral Tayner, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai and will hold a joint meeting with the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Public Settlement Defense Committee today (the 4th) to discuss the overall situation in Shanghai, and important resolutions are expected.</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, the military commanders of various countries have jointly sent a letter of protest to the British, American, and Italian Consuls-General regarding the Japanese military's encroachment in the defense zones assigned to various countries within the Public Settlement, requesting that they negotiate with the Japanese side. It is reported that Colonel Capazzi, the Italian Commander, also signed the letter, which further demonstrates the harmonious cooperation among the commanders of various countries responsible for the defense of the Public Settlement and is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Cooperation between the British and French Concessions</h3>
<p>Macnaghten Sends a Letter of Thanks to the French Consul-General</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), Macnaghten, sent a letter to the French Consul-General yesterday (the 3rd), stating that the SMC is deeply grateful for the friendly and prompt assistance provided by the French Concession administration during this critical situation. He was especially grateful for the permission to relocate hospitals and medical services from the dangerous areas within the British Concession to the French Concession, and to arrange for their accommodation. At the same time, SMC Director-General Jones also sent a letter to M. Follot, Director-General of the French Concession Municipal Council, thanking him for his generous assistance and requesting him to convey the SMC's gratitude to the medical staff of the French Concession.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft</p>
<h3>Dropping Bombs and Causing Fires Everywhere</h3>
<p>Smoke and Flames Fill the Sky Near Zhabei</p>
<p>Starting at six o'clock yesterday morning, Japanese troops frequently used artillery to attack Baoxing Road and Fusheng Road. At that time, it was raining and snowing lightly. At 9:20, a fire broke out in the area of East Baoxing Road and Fusheng Road. In an instant, fierce flames soared into the sky, burning higher and higher. The flames could be seen from ordinary three-story buildings. The sound of artillery and gunfire was also the most intense at this time. Soon after, a fire broke out in Lude Xingli on Wenshan Teacher Road, and the concession fire engines rushed to extinguish it. At ten o'clock, thick smoke also rose from the area north of Shenjiawan and Tiantong'an. However, the area burned and the duration were not as extensive as those on East Baoxing Road. Around one o'clock in the afternoon, three Japanese planes came from the east, circling the area of thick smoke several times before two flew towards western Shanghai and one towards the southern part of the city. The two planes then flew back from western Shanghai, dropping bombs on places like Datong Road and Zhongshan Road in Zhabei. It was heard that Zhongshan Road and Zhongshan Bridge had been destroyed. The plane that flew south had not returned for a long time, presumably detouring to Pudong and returning directly to the warship. Afterwards, it was heard that a bomb had been dropped on Longhua, but it fell on an open space and caused little damage. The Japanese artillery fire was the fiercest at noon. Even in the southern part of the city, the sound was very clear. In total, the Japanese army fired no fewer than two or three thousand shells yesterday.</p>
<p>Qujiang Road and Xiangshan Road Yesterday, Japanese military aircraft dropped many bombs in the Zhabei area. In the area of Qujiang Road and Xiangshan Road, civilian houses and Cantonese businesses were destroyed by fire due to the many bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft after ten o'clock in the morning. The area burned covered about a mile. From morning to three o'clock in the afternoon, black smoke filled the sky, almost obscuring half of the sky over Zhabei.</p>
<p>Suzhou Creek Yesterday, at around ten o'clock in the morning, fires broke out in places like North Henan Road and North Shanxi Road, and the fires spread rapidly. It was heard that fires broke out in eight places from Seward Road to North Shanxi Road, and they had not been extinguished by the evening.</p>
<p>Shanghai Banking Sector</p>
<h3>Rejecting the Finance Minister's Request for a Loan</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Zhang Yongni sent a telegram to the Shanghai banking sector the other day, continuing to discuss the loan previously talked about. Song Ziwen himself also came to Shanghai yesterday. It was heard that the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, and other commercial banks have politely declined, stating that due to repeated civil wars in the country and the depletion of public bonds, there are currently no funds available for borrowing.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Closes Down</h3>
<p>All Staff Suspended</p>
<p>Wages to be Paid and Staff Dismissed Today</p>
<p>Opinions from the Workers' Side</p>
<p>After the Japanese invaders attacked our Zhabei, they used aircraft to drop bombs and sulfur bombs at will, destroying countless lives and property. The Commercial Press and the Oriental Library, China's only large-scale cultural institutions, were both burned to the ground and turned to ashes. The board of directors of the Commercial Press has held several meetings in recent days to discuss the aftermath and believes that it is impossible to continue operations. It has been decided to announce the closure of the business, and all staff will be paid and dismissed. The handling of all matters after the closure will be resolved at a shareholders' meeting. The announcement of the closure by the board of directors and the regulations for paying wages are recorded below: (1) Announcement: During this disaster in Zhabei, the company's printing and manufacturing plant, general affairs office, translation department, and Oriental Library were all reduced to ashes. The hard work of twenty-five years has been turned to ashes. The cruel situation is beyond description. Furthermore, the situation of colleagues whose homes have been destroyed and who are displaced is even more heartbreaking. Now, the company and its colleagues are fundamentally unable to continue operations. After repeated discussions at an emergency meeting of the board of directors, it has been decided to close the company's general affairs office and the four departments of translation, printing, publishing, and research, as well as the Hongkou and Ximen branches. All colleagues will be suspended. As for the aftermath, in addition to calling a shareholders' meeting to resolve the issues, the board of directors will temporarily handle the matters. The regulations for colleagues are as follows: (1) In addition to the salary already paid up to the end of January this year, each colleague will be paid an additional half-month's salary. If the amount received is less than 20 yuan, each person will receive an additional 12 yuan (19 yuan will only receive an additional 1 yuan). If the remainder is less than 1 yuan, it will be rounded up to 1 yuan. The dates and locations for all payments will be announced separately. (2) For colleagues with current savings accounts of 50 yuan or more, in addition to withdrawing 50 yuan, they may also withdraw one-quarter of the amount exceeding 50 yuan (to be paid at 24 Ningbo Road from 8:30 to 11:00 a.m. and from 12:30 to 3:00 p.m. on the 5th of this month). The company will do its best to raise funds to arrange for the withdrawal of the remaining three-quarters and colleagues' special savings in installments. (3) All loans owed by colleagues to the company will be settled later. At this time of shared hardship between the company and its colleagues, we are reluctantly making this unavoidable decision. We hope that all colleagues who can return to their hometowns will do so as soon as possible to leave this dangerous situation. Please also send your mailing addresses in writing to the company for registration, so that we can communicate in the future. We hereby announce this to all colleagues. The Board of Directors. February 4, 1932. (2) Announcement: The payment of half-month's salary to colleagues has already been announced. It is hereby decided that the payment will be made on the 5th of this month. The locations, times, and sections are listed below: (1) Location: 24 Ningbo Road (between Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road). (2) Time and Sections: 8:30 to 11:00 a.m., salaries will be paid to female colleagues in the general affairs office, translation department, publishing department, and printing plant. (3) 12:30 to 5:00 p.m., salaries will be paid to colleagues in the printing plant. The heads, deputy heads, and directors of the printing plant's various departments are requested to arrive at the location half an hour before the scheduled time to assist. The Board of Directors. February 4, 1932.</p>
<p>During this national crisis, the families of the workers of the Commercial Press were all in Zhabei, and they suffered terribly from the burning and looting. Those who were able to escape to the concessions were displaced and unable to maintain their livelihoods. Yesterday, the responsible representatives of the Commercial Press office, Ge Hecai, Feng Jifang, Wan Pusheng, and Ma Weiqun, discussed relief measures with the general manager of the company, Wang Yunwu. It has been decided that the company will first issue half a month's salary. Those with too small a salary will be given a discretionary subsidy in addition to borrowing half a month's salary. At the same time, the company authorities stated that the board of directors, due to the bombing of the main plant and the heavy losses, will suspend all employees of the company to facilitate liquidation. Representatives Ge Hecai and others stated that the Commercial Press is China's only cultural institution and that both labor and management should endure the pain and maintain it. This concerns the livelihoods of thousands of employees, and the company is requested to pay careful attention. If the situation is chaotic and reorganization takes time, and it is absolutely necessary to temporarily suspend work, efforts should be made to maintain the livelihoods of the employees. The workers are eager to protect the company and may temporarily accept the situation with pain. However, a sudden announcement of the suspension of all employees would only cause misunderstanding and lead to disputes. Mr. Wang Yunwu immediately stated verbally that the suspension also meant a temporary work stoppage. Representatives Ge Hecai and others requested that Mr. Wang Yunwu clearly announce the words "temporary work stoppage" if it was absolutely necessary. However, Mr. Wang Yunwu replied that he had to respect the wishes of the board of directors.</p>
<p>One Hundred and Sixty Trade Associations</p>
<h3>Oppose the Establishment of a Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>Yesterday, an Urgent Telegram was Sent to the National Government</p>
<p>Hoping for the Unanimous Support of All Sectors</p>
<p>It has been reported that 160 trade associations in this city, including the ash factory, silk and satin, and cotton cloth industries, have proposed five measures to China and Japan, including the establishment of a neutral zone outside the concessions. The associations sent an urgent telegram to the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Luoyang and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Military Affairs in Nanjing yesterday, vowing to oppose it to the death. The text is as follows: (Omitted) The British and American (omitted) have suggested five measures, including stopping hostile actions between Japan and China. It is heard that our government has fully accepted them. However, the establishment of a neutral zone is a matter of great importance and should be handled with caution by our government authorities. It is noted that this time, the Japanese army used the Public Settlement as a base to invade various parts of Zhabei. The Japanese soldiers are certainly the aggressors, but the concession authorities have abandoned their neutral rights and violated their neutral responsibilities, which has led to this situation. The best course of action now is for the concession authorities to conscientiously fulfill their neutral obligations, quickly disarm the Japanese troops who are disrupting the neutral zone and endangering the security of the concession, and expel them from the country. Then, our compatriots will, as always, maintain their original intention of being friendly to foreign countries and will never hinder the security of the concession. If, instead of doing this, they want to establish a so-called neutral zone outside the concession, it is simply a clever way to give up national territory. The soldiers at the front have a responsibility to defend the country, and not an inch of land can be given to others. They have made solemn oaths, and the spirits of the ancestors are watching. Our associations and all the merchants in Shanghai must resolutely oppose this. We respectfully request that your government respect public opinion and make a decisive decision to firmly reject the establishment of a neutral zone outside the concession. The merchants of Shanghai, who have survived the flames of war, will spare no sacrifice and vow to be the government's strong support. This telegram is sent with utmost urgency. Shanghai City Ash Factory Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Color Printing Industry, Floss Industry, North-South Goods Exchange Industry, Rice Shop Industry, Ash Industry, Mercerized Cotton Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Lime Transport and Sales Industry, Sugar Industry, Coal Industry, Bamboo Industry, Construction Plant Industry, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, Medicinal Materials Industry, Western Medicine Industry, Southern Goods Industry, Intestine Industry, Taxi Rental Industry, Land Goods Industry, Pawnshop Industry, Letterpress Printing Industry, Gelatin Miscellaneous Goods Industry, and other 160 trade associations.

<h3>More U.S. Marines Arrive</h3>
<p>U.S.S. Ashtabula and H.M.S. Kent Arrive Today</p>
<p>In addition to the 600 U.S. Marines who arrived from Little Luzon the other day, another group of over 1,000 marines arrived yesterday. They landed on the Bund and have been ordered to take up positions in designated areas. It has also been confirmed that the large contingent of marines carried by the U.S. transport ship will arrive in Shanghai today along with seven destroyers from Manila. The British cruiser H.M.S. Kent, carrying Naval Commander Kelley, will also arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, after the U.S.S. Ashtabula, the last U.S. warship to arrive in Shanghai, arrives this afternoon (the 5th), the number of U.S. troops stationed in Shanghai will reach 6,000. There are currently nine U.S. warships anchored in the Huangpu River and eight warships on their way from Manila to Shanghai, with a total of 3,400 soldiers. The ships on the way are expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning. All the soldiers on the ships will remain on board awaiting orders. The deployment of the 1,200 infantrymen brought by the U.S.S. Ashtabula has not yet been decided. Since the arrival of the U.S. troops, the Japanese troops on North Gordon Road withdrew at noon today and were replaced by U.S. troops, which has stabilized the situation in the area.</p>
<h3>Ample Grain Supply in This Port</h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>There is no need to worry about the food supply in this port. The rice stored in the concessions is sufficient for one month. As of yesterday, 12,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon have been loaded, but due to the lack of dockworkers yesterday, they could not be unloaded and landed. They will be unloaded and put into warehouses today.</p>
<p>Notice from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to rice merchants in other ports yesterday, stating that the rice business in this port resumed normal operations on February 4. All rice ships from other ports have been given real protection by the authorities of the Chinese and foreign concessions, who have dispatched additional military police. The Yangjingbang Fengyu Wharf in the southern city and the Binnan Wharf between the Xinlaji Bridge and the Old Laji Bridge in the northern city have been designated for berthing and unloading rice. All rice ships from other ports can pass without hindrance for water transportation and unloading at the wharves. The Xiaoshadu and Fanwangdu areas, which were previously garrisoned by Japanese troops, have now been evacuated and are guarded by British and American military police. The merchants have made it clear that they will provide protection and release them at any time, and there is no danger. This notice is hereby issued for your information.</p>
<p>Food Supply in the Concessions (1) Meat. The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) slaughterhouse slaughtered 34 cattle, 10 sheep, 66 calves, and 16 pigs on the 3rd. On the 4th, there were 91 dead cattle, 77 calves, and 27 pigs suspended in the slaughterhouse. There were 44 live cattle and 83 live sheep. Some butchers returned to the slaughterhouse yesterday, but when they saw Japanese aircraft flying by, they fled again. Therefore, the number of animals slaughtered could not meet the quota. The Yangshupu pig slaughterhouse slaughtered some pigs, which were exclusively for Chinese use. The stocks in the butcher shops in the Hongkou district are currently being transported out. (2) Vegetable Market. Many vegetables arrived in the western district this morning (the 4th). The Seymour Road vegetable market has ample meat and vegetables, as well as fish. The Maer Road has plenty of pork and vegetables. The Xinzha Road and Beijing Road lack fish. Fuzhou Road has a rich supply of green vegetables and game. The eastern district, except for the Wuzhou Road and East Hongkou markets, has sufficient goods, which seems to be enough to supply the needs of the district. The northern district only has stocks for sale, and there are no new goods.</p>
<h3>Statements from Various Organizations</h3>
<p>Telegram from Overseas Chinese in Jilong The overseas Chinese in Jilong sent a telegram stating: "Mayor Wu of Shanghai, greetings to all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army. The Japanese invaders are committing heinous acts of burning, killing, and raping. Fortunately, all of you have bravely defeated the enemy. The overseas Chinese admire you and send this telegram to express our condolences and congratulations. We ask that you continue your efforts. The overseas Chinese vow to be your support." Jilong All Overseas Chinese Branch.</p>
<p>Two Telegrams from the YWCA The YWCA is very indignant at the Shanghai Incident. In addition to the foreign secretaries sending telegrams to the United States and Geneva reporting the truth about the atrocities of the Japanese army, the president and general secretary of the association also sent urgent telegrams to the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom and the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, Yan Huiqing, the other day, requesting that they urge the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations Council to take effective measures as soon as possible to stop the Japanese army's atrocities in Shanghai. The original telegrams are translated as follows: (1) To Ms. Dingmen, President of the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom: Efforts to safeguard the territorial integrity of all countries and abandon war for peace for more than ten years have been destroyed by the current situation of Japan's undeclared war against China. All international peace treaties are clearly insufficient to prevent Japanese military aggression and are virtually reduced to waste paper. However, any effective disarmament policy should be based on ensuring that all countries have no territorial ambitions and engage in aggressive actions. The experiences of the Near East and the Shanghai Incident have made us feel even more the necessity of the great powers reducing their armaments. We hope that the Disarmament Conference will take appropriate measures to establish effective guarantees and achieve the goal of eliminating the policy of force. Zheng Shengzu Xin, Ding Shujing, Winter. (2) To Mr. Yan Huiqing, Member of the League of Nations Council: The Japanese army in Shanghai has deliberately created a serious situation and used the Public Settlement as a base of operations to satisfy its desire for free and violent riots. We hope that you will invoke the most powerful provisions of the Covenant and request the Council to take effective measures as soon as possible to stop the Japanese army's atrocities in Shanghai. We will be your support. Zheng Shengzu Jing, Ding Shujing, Winter.</p>
<p>Important Telegram from the General Labor Union The General Labor Union of this city sent a telegram to Ramsay MacDonald, leader of the British Labour Party, stating: "To Mr. Ramsay MacDonald of London, greetings. Japan is determined to implement its policy of force, intends to annex our territory and exterminate our people with its entire nation's army. The three northeastern provinces have already been occupied, and Shanghai has been attacked again. It relies on occupying the Public Settlement as its military base of operations, and disregards humanity, constantly using aircraft to attack our Zhabei, resulting in thousands of people being bombed and tens of millions of dollars worth of property being burned. The so-called Pact of Paris has been reduced to waste paper, and the resolutions of the League of Nations have been completely violated. The world peace that we relied on has been dashed. It has been heard that you have proposed that all countries impose economic sanctions on Japan to maintain the prestige of the League of Nations and to place the violent under the sanctions of justice. We are deeply impressed by this news and, on behalf of the 800,000 workers in the city, sincerely hope that you will continue to uphold justice and promote its success, so that the violent can submit to justice as soon as possible and world peace can be maintained. This is entirely dependent on you. This is respectfully submitted, and we wish you good health. Shanghai General Labor Union. Signed."</p>

<h3>Killing and Arson Everywhere</h3>
<p>The Hongkou area is in a state of utter devastation.</p>
<p>The Central Fire Brigade bravely attempts to provide rescue.</p>
<p>For days, Japanese plainclothes personnel and troops have been rampaging in the Hongkou area north of the Suzhou Creek, looting extensively. Many residents have been arrested and shot. They are also using heavy sums of money to hire Chinese and Korean thugs to pour flammable materials such as gasoline and sulfur on the doors and windows of residences in the Hongkou district, and then set them on fire. Meanwhile, Japanese marines have placed machine guns at all entrances and exits for defense. If residents fleeing the fire are encountered, they are all shot down without exception. It can truly be said to be the height of cruelty. Fortunately, Chinese and foreign members of the Central Fire Brigade, not fearing hardship or danger, drove to the scene. Amidst the hail of bullets, they bravely poured water to extinguish the fire, thus preventing it from spreading. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable. While the Chinese and foreign members were extinguishing the fire, the Japanese troops continued to fire rifles frequently, preventing the rescue efforts. This only stopped after repeated negotiations. Here is a brief record of the places that were burned: ㈠ At Yuanfang Lane on Broadway Road, a fire started at 6:00 PM on the second day, destroying two and a half houses. ㈡ Tongtaiyong and the adjacent houses on Xihua Road and Wuchang Road were burned at around 4:00 AM on the morning of the third day. ㈢ Qingyun Lane on North Sichuan Road was burned at 11:00 AM on the morning of the third day, destroying four houses from number 36 to number 39. Guangxing Lane next door was also burned. ㈣ Ludexing Lane was destroyed at 11:00 AM yesterday, destroying six houses from number 580 to number 85. Furthermore, members of the Central Fire Brigade drove to Hongkou and other places yesterday to fight fires. While passing Dexing Lane next to the telephone company on Haining Road, they saw a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl suffering from illness looking out from the lane entrance. They immediately went inside, rescued her, and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that her family members had all been shot by Japanese soldiers. She was spared because she was ill in bed and had not been harmed. She had not eaten for three days and was burning with hunger. Therefore, she was looking out from the lane entrance, preparing to escape.</p>
<p>Heartbreaking</p>
<h3>Our Compatriots Massacred</h3>
<p>The Japanese are so brutal.</p>
<p>They are enemies of humanity.</p>
<p>Thirteen corpses. Some days ago, residents Zhang Zhu, Xu Wang, and others claimed that they lived in ten houses on Binlang Road. Fearing the outbreak of war, they discussed digging a cellar for shelter in the house. Because the sound was loud, it was heard by Japanese soldiers outside the door. They immediately knocked on the door, entered, and arrested many people, including their husbands, and have not been released. Subsequently, the police station of the Sixth District, on Rue Robert, discovered thirteen male corpses on the riverbank opposite the Rihua Yarn Factory north of the Suzhou Creek. All were covered in knife wounds. Nine were identified by family members such as Zhang Zhu. The other four have not yet been claimed. They are: ㈠ Guo Zhengyou, 28 years old, from Qingjiang, yarn factory worker, resident of number 372, third house of ten houses on Binlang Road. ㈡ Shen Chang'an, 32 years old, from Funing, cement worker, resident of the same address. ㈢ Ding Maitang, 24 years old, from Taizhou, leather worker, resident of number 370, third house of ten houses. ㈣ Zhang Jintang, 32 years old, from Funing, fishmonger, resident of number 108, third house of ten houses. ㈤ Wang Huaiyu, 40 years old, from Funing, joss paper seller, resident of number 358, third house of ten houses. ㈥ Xu Weiyi, 32 years old, from Funing, rickshaw puller, resident of number 168, third house of ten houses. ㈦ Cui Bing, 39 years old, from Funing, fishmonger, resident of number 108, third house of ten houses. ㈧ Pan Zhengjin, 21 years old, from Huaicheng, iron worker, resident of number 362, third house of ten houses. ㈨ Wang Fengcai, 36 years old, from Funing, resident of a bungalow in ten houses. ㈩㈩㈠㈩㈡㈩</p>

Three female workers from the Shenxin No. 7 Factory in Yangshupu were stabbed to death by Japanese soldiers for no reason when they passed the Japanese military defense line at the end of Pingliang Road and Gelan Road at around 4:00 PM yesterday. Their corpses and the several bags of flour they were carrying were dragged away together.</p>
<p>Chinese arrested and stabbed. According to eyewitnesses, yesterday afternoon, more than 30 Chinese people on the Huangpu Wharf were captured by Japanese soldiers and taken to a Japanese warship docked at the shore. Any resistance was met with stabbing by Japanese soldiers with bayonets. Many people were injured at the time, including several children.</p>
<p>Two spouses shot to death. Yang Runfu's family, who opened a millet shop on Jiangwan Road, opposite the Zhizhi Middle School on East Tiyu Road, was performing a year-end ancestral sacrifice the day before yesterday afternoon. While burning tin ingots, Japanese soldiers suddenly rushed in and shot and killed Mr. and Mrs. Yang. The situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Eleven people arrested. Eleven Chinese people were arrested by Japanese soldiers at the intersection of Shenjiawan and Jiaxing Road in Hongkou.</p>

<p>Compatriots brutally murdered by Japanese soldiers ㈡</p>
<p>Tao Ayin hit by a bullet. Tao Ayin, a 46-year-old Ningbo native from No. 3 Hongxing Road, Zhabei, was standing idly at the door at around 3:00 PM yesterday when a stray bullet flew over and injured his left shoulder.

According to a peddler who was arrested and released yesterday, he saw a total of 140 or 150 Chinese people detained inside the Japanese headquarters. Most of them had been stabbed in the chest and abdomen by Japanese soldiers and died. Their bodies were loaded into burlap sacks and transported away by trucks. The Feng brothers and others have all been killed.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce writes to the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Investigate the Whereabouts of Xiang Songmao</h3>
<p>And request the eradication of Japanese thugs lurking in the concession. Xiang Songmao, manager of the Wuzhou Pharmacy, was arrested by plainclothes personnel at the Lao Baizi Road branch on January 30. It has been reported that he has been killed by Japanese soldiers. Furthermore, Luo Yunxiang, Mao Zhengxiang, Ying Wenda, and Bao Zhengwu, four members of the Boy Scouts organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to carry out refugee relief work, have also been arrested by Japanese soldiers and their fate is unknown. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that Mr. Xiang and others disappeared in the Public Concession and were brutally murdered by Japanese plainclothes personnel. However, the Public Concession authorities have not taken effective measures to protect the residents of the concession. Therefore, it has requested the Public Concession Municipal Council to handle two matters: ㈠ Conduct a serious negotiation with the Japanese military to investigate the whereabouts of Mr. Xiang. If he has only been arrested by the Japanese and has not yet been killed, efforts should be made to rescue him. If he has been killed, the murderer should be searched for and severely punished. ㈡ Any Japanese residents who privately possess weapons and specialize in killing Chinese people should be thoroughly investigated and eradicated. They should not be allowed to lurk or remain in the concession. Furthermore, the Public Concession is not a Japanese military occupied area and cannot allow them to arbitrarily implement a military system that endangers the lives of citizens in a neutral zone.</p>
<h3>The Ferocity of the Japanese Increases</h3>
<p>Tragedy at Zhizhi Middle School. At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Japanese troops in the Jiangwan Road area suddenly broke into the Zhizhi College middle school. When they rushed in, they immediately stabbed the school's gatekeeper to death with bayonets. They invaded the interior of the school and drove more than ten male and female servants of the school to a corner and immediately shot them to death, without exception. They continued to invade the fourth floor dormitory, the third floor dining hall, the classroom, the auditorium, and other places, setting them on fire, causing all the school's large collection of books, instruments, and buildings to be burned.</p>
<p>Western woman suffers terribly. The "Continental Daily" reported that Mrs. Rice, a British woman residing on Baoshan Road, was arrested by the Japanese police patrol and taken to headquarters on Saturday, accused of being a Chinese military spy. She was detained for five days before being released. She reported everything to the Diswell Road police station in a panic. According to her, she tried to escape from her home when the war broke out on the night of January 28, but was stopped by Japanese soldiers. On Tuesday morning, she and her two Chinese servants were arrested as spies. The faces of her Chinese servants had already been tattooed. Their fate is unknown. She also said that the tragic scenes she saw were unbearable to describe. Three nurses from the Chinese Red Cross were injured by hand grenades thrown by Japanese soldiers while working on Xiangshan Road and Hongxing Road in Zhabei. One of them was seriously injured and is feared to be beyond hope. A servant at the Soochow University Law School on Kunshan Road was standing leaning against the door when a Japanese soldier suddenly came and stabbed him in the chest with a gun for no reason. The man immediately fell to the ground and the gun was stuck deeply, making it difficult to pull out. The Japanese soldier stepped on the corpse with his foot and pulled it out, then repeatedly stabbed it several times. At that time, a truck carrying Japanese members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps passed by the door and witnessed everything.</p>
<p>Japanese ruffian commits crime. Yesterday, a Japanese ruffian mingled near the Great World, intending to cause trouble. He was detected by the French police patrol. When they were about to check him, the ruffian pulled out a pistol and fired wildly. He was eventually shot and killed by the French police.</p>

"The Red Cross establishes a rear hospital in Wusong" The Chinese Red Cross, due to the expansion of the war zone, has specially organized a rear hospital in Wusong. Doctors and nurses were assigned last night (4th) and will go to Wusong this morning with medicines.

"A glimpse of the Red Cross's rescue work" ㈠ Xue Zhenyi, the leader of the second branch of the Chinese Red Cross, set off at 8:00 AM yesterday. Because the driver was timid, Gu Zhuxuan, a special member of the association, sent a driver to drive the car to the west end of Qiujiang Road and Baoshan Road in Zhabei. However, because sandbags blocked the road and he could not pass, he abandoned the car and walked to Baoshan Road Station. Bullets were flying like rain and the sound of cannons was deafening. He rescued soldiers Cheng Biao from one company and Xie Shanbiao, the squad leader of the ninth company of the third battalion, as well as several wounded civilians, and sent them to the Second Hospital of the Association. More than ten refugees were sent to the shelter. ㈡ Hai Zongqi, the leader of the first branch of the Chinese Red Cross, rescued six wounded soldiers from the 78th Division, including Huo Hui, Zhou Guoqing, Wu Doula, Liu Qinggan, Feng Deqing, and Hu Shenglin, as well as dozens of wounded civilians, including Zhang Guilin and Gao Chenmin, and sent them to the first, second, and seventh hospitals of the Red Cross for treatment due to the intense fighting yesterday.</p>

<h3>The Social Bureau Transports Disaster Victims by Water</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau believes that the people in the Zhabei area are suffering unspeakable misery due to the trampling of Japanese soldiers. Therefore, it is intensifying its efforts to relieve refugees. It is learned that in addition to transporting the rescued refugees to safe places inland for resettlement, it is also sending special personnel to transport refugees by civilian ships along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines due to the crowding of land trains. Wang Bing and Jiang Zhiyong are assigned to contact the resettlement and transportation of refugees in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area. Wang Gang, Zhu Jintao, Li Huasun, Xing Sheng, Shi Guo, and other five personnel are assigned to contact the Changyi and other cities to investigate the damage suffered by refugees in the resettlement centers in the city and report them at any time for negotiation. According to reports, Jinshan can resettle 2,000 refugees and Qingpu can resettle 3,000 refugees.</p>
<p>Each county sets up resettlement centers. The Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association has learned that the temporary resettlement centers in the Public Concession and the French Concession for refugees in Zhabei and Hongkou are now full. Therefore, it has negotiated with the Shanghai Special City Party Department to send rescue workers to neighboring counties to contact and set up resettlement centers in order to rescue and transport people. Yesterday, the City Party Department received news from various counties that they have agreed to set up refugee resettlement centers. The summary is as follows:</p>
<p>(Jinshan County) Zhang Xiaotong, a rescue worker who went to Jinshan County, returned to Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday and reported that he had contacted Huang Zhewen, the county magistrate of Jinshan County, and Jinshan Tuozai in Zhujing to set up a refugee resettlement center, which can accommodate about 2,000 people. The county will bear half of the expenses and Shanghai will bear the other half. It is more convenient to transport them to the county by waterway. (Qingpu County) Wu Fei, a rescue worker who went to Qingpu, returned to Shanghai at 12:00 noon yesterday and reported that he had contacted the county magistrate and local chambers of commerce and other groups to set up a refugee resettlement center, which can accommodate about 800 to 3,000 people. The county will raise the funds, and the location will be set up in Qingpu City. It is more convenient to transport them by waterway. A notice will be sent to the police to protect them one day before transporting the refugees. (Wujiang County) Yesterday, rescue worker Feng Yixian was sent with a letter to the county magistrate and the chamber of commerce to negotiate the establishment of a refugee resettlement center, and the county magistrate of Qingpu County sent a letter to the county.</p>
<p>Collecting donations of bedding from all walks of life. The Shanghai Citizen Local Maintenance Association has gathered leaders from all walks of life in the city to plan to maintain industry, regulate finance, and rescue refugees, with the main goal of rescuing refugees. The association is now working extremely hard on this matter, with abundant funds. Many foreigners have also participated and donated large sums of money. However, due to the large number of refugees, there is not enough time to prepare everything, and there is a great shortage of items such as bedding. People with a sympathetic heart who express sympathy for the relief of refugees are welcome to donate funds, and it is even more needed and hoped that bedding and wool blankets can be donated. The weather is cold, and the refugees are suffering immensely. I hope that the people of the country will do their best to donate. The office of the association is located at 66 Sichuan Road. Donations can be sent to that location.</p>
<p>Red Swastika Society Rescue News. The Red Swastika Society said that it has rescued many refugees in the past few days, and the first resettlement center is no longer sufficient. It has borrowed the basketball room of the Sports Advancement Association as the second resettlement center, which is managed by Liu Jiangpu. The association's rescue vehicles are in great need. Yesterday, Chen Shanzhi borrowed three cars for direct delivery to the victims of the war zone until the end of the war. The first group of the association's rescue team rescued more than 150 women and children in the Zhongxing Road area yesterday. The first and second teams rescued more than 200 women and children on Gonghe Xin Road. The injured Liu Guisheng, Li Sun, Tao Zhang, Zhang Yongsheng, and others were all sent to the Red Swastika Society Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Jisheng Association Rescue Team Encountered Danger. The Chinese Jisheng Association has been sending teams to the Zhabei war zone to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees for several days. At 2:00 PM yesterday, it set off for Zhabei again. The first group went to the Sun [illegible character], the second group went to the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Station, and the third group went to the Hongxing Road area, rescuing 21 wounded soldiers and wounded civilians He Chen and Wang Yuankui's mother, etc. The wounded soldiers were sent to the Fourth Hospital of the Red Cross (ie the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital). When the third rescue team of the association passed Hongxing Road, a stray bullet fell 100 yards away, and the loud noise caused tiles and stones to fly everywhere. Upon closer inspection, it was a broken shell from a heavy artillery explosion. The destroyed stone was cut off like a knife, and half of the surface was black powder. Furthermore, the refugees in the association's resettlement centers are provided with food and accommodation by the association, which requires a stone of white rice every day, and the number of refugees is increasing day by day, making it difficult to continue. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will be happy to donate rice.</p>
<p>Rescue work at Pushan Hospital. Pushan Hospital (ie the Red Cross 7th Wounded Soldier Hospital) has been rescuing wounded soldiers and civilians in the Zhabei war zone for several days.

Japanese residents from Xunwu Yisha Sichuan and Hunan have arrived in Hankou. The Japanese army has built defense projects beyond the border in the streets adjacent to the Special First District and the Japanese Concession, and vehicle traffic has been cut off.

<p>The Five Recommendations of the Powers</p>
<h3>Japan Rejects Item Five</h3>
<p>Reply Delivered to Envoys of Three Nations</p>
<p>Items One to Four Fully Accepted</p>
<p>Interference in Negotiations on Outstanding Issues Not Permitted</p>
<p>No Intention to Abandon Hostile Actions</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japan's reply to the five proposals from the powers, was delivered by Foreign Minister Yoshizawa to the British, American, and French ambassadors at 6 p.m. tonight. The document accepts the first item: both sides cease violent actions; rejects the second item: no further preparations for hostile actions; and completely accepts the third and fourth items: the withdrawal of Chinese and Japanese combatants from all points of contact within Shanghai, and the establishment of a neutral zone, guarded by neutral countries, to protect the International Settlement, the arrangements for which will be made by local consular authorities. The fifth item, to immediately begin unconditional negotiations, in the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations resolution of December 9, with the assistance of neutral observers, to resolve all outstanding issues, was rejected. The document stated that if the Japanese army is certain that the Chinese will immediately and completely cease threatening and disruptive actions, then the Japanese army will also agree to cease hostile actions. However, if the Chinese regular army and plainclothes soldiers remain stubborn, Japan will have to reserve complete freedom of action. Due to the past Chinese threats and the severity of the current situation, the Japanese government feels it cannot completely abandon mobilization or preparations for hostility. If necessary, Japan does not object to the Japanese Consul General and the Japanese military commander joining the negotiations on the agreement to separate the forces and establish a neutral zone in the Zhabei district. The so-called outstanding issues between China and Japan almost all include the Manchurian issue. The Japanese government considers the Manchurian issue to be completely unrelated to the Shanghai incident. The Manchurian issue will be handled in accordance with the resolution passed by the League of Nations Administrative Council on December 10, and it will not accept the assistance of neutral observers to resolve various issues concerning Manchuria, which is the established policy of the Japanese government. Therefore, the fifth proposal of the powers cannot be accepted. It is heard that although Japan recognizes the establishment of a neutral zone, it will probably propose the establishment of a permanent "sentry belt" to replace a temporary neutral zone, but the document did not mention this point. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa visited Saionji today to discuss the five measures proposed by the governments of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy to resolve the Far Eastern issue.

He will ask the British, French, and Italian ambassadors to Japan to consider the revised form of the proposal tomorrow. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Our Reply Arrives in America</h3>
<p>Borah Ridicules Japanese Prime Minister's Declaration</p>
<p>Washington, After Britain and the United States put forward peace proposals, China's reply arrived in America today. British Ambassador Lindsay and Deputy Secretary of State Castle met today and stated that although the Japanese rejected the clause of assisting in the settlement of outstanding issues between China and Japan by neutral observers, the first four items of the proposal refer specifically to the Shanghai case, so it is believed that there can be some progress. (National Telegraph, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington, China has fully accepted the peace proposals for Shanghai put forward by the powers. Japan has not yet replied at this time. Secretary of State Stimson asked Japanese Ambassador Debuchi to meet at the Hoot Lake Villa today, so it is rumored outside that the two committee members will conduct important discussions on the situation in the East. It is also said that Debuchi will send the Japanese reply. Senator Borah, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi's declaration was inappropriate and surprising, because he even said that Japanese planes never bombed the Chinese area of ​​Shanghai. He meant that Inukai Tsuyoshi should issue an appropriate explanation again. (National Telegraph, 3rd)</p>
<p>Nanjing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to Britain, the United States, and other countries on the 4th, saying that in response to the matter, it has received your Excellency's note, notifying the Chinese National Government of your government's proposals for resolving the current incident. The National Government is determined to earnestly desire to strictly abide by international agreements that are sufficient to guarantee world peace, as well as national sovereignty, independence, and the integrity of land administration. The National Government hereby accepts the proposals notified by your government. Furthermore, the friendly nations have a great relationship with the situation in the Far East, not only for the general interests of peace, but also for the dignity of the above-mentioned international agreements jointly signed by the friendly nations. The Chinese National Government fervently hopes that the friendly nations will participate in future consultations in the capacity of participants rather than observers. As for the terms neutral zone and neutral person used in the fourth section of the proposal, what the National Government wants to point out is that these terms are not applicable to the current situation in China. Therefore, the proposal is separately changed to peaceful area and third country. It should be replied accordingly for your information. (Special Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Japanese League of Nations representative Sato informed the League of Nations Secretary-General, stating the Shanghai incident, saying that China violated the truce agreement and attacked the Japanese army, etc. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that this time the Chinese army in Shanghai completely took self-defense actions, and the right to self-defense is a right enjoyed by all countries. The steps taken by China in the League of Nations are not in violation. (Special Telegram, 4th)</p>

Matsudaira, Sato, and Drummond discussed the situation in Shanghai and the actions taken by a certain country regarding the situation in Shanghai, but the details of the discussion have not been released.

<p>Japanese Representative to the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Publishes Letter to Americans</h3>
<p>Aggression Falsely Claimed as Self-Defense</p>
<p>Warmongering, Talk of Peace</p>
<p>Geneva, Japanese representative Sato sent a letter to the American people by radio tonight, with many criticisms of China. It is said that he wishes the disarmament conference success, but the opening of the disarmament conference coincides with the serious situation in the Far East, which can be said to be unfortunate. Sato stated that the recent incidents in Manchuria and Shanghai are due to the organized methods that China has used to attack Japan incessantly for several years, leading to them. It is the same as the recent two-week anti-foreign movement. Japan has no choice but to defend itself against this movement. Sato then described the situation in Manchuria, saying that Japan does not politically dominate Manchuria, nor does it intend to monopolize the economy, because the open-door policy has been established for many years, so the monopolization plan will not last. What Japan hopes is just as Yoshizawa expressed, that is, to earnestly maintain peace and order, and to seek local stability for the Chinese and foreigners, and to enable the local economy to develop. Sato discussed the unfortunate incident in Shanghai, saying that all the fault lies with the Chinese, and Japan is acting in legitimate self-defense. He hopes that the general public can prove this. Sato compared Japan's actions with the actions of the powers in Beijing in 1927. The final conclusion is that Japan will do its best to peacefully resolve the current conflict, and Japan is very pleased that the United States can observe the Chinese incident with sympathy and a steady attitude.

<h3>Quietly Watches the Development of the Shanghai Situation</h3>
<p>No Debate in Parliament</p>
<p>MacDonald Has Eye Surgery</p>
<p>London, Foreign Minister Simon replied to a member of the Lower House today, saying that the negotiations between the powers to restore the usual situation in Shanghai can now be expected to have some effect. The British government is now calmly watching the situation and waiting for the intervention of the powers to have an undisturbed influence. Labour Party leader Lansbury said that he tacitly agrees with the government's intention not to debate this matter. Labour Party member Maxton said that the parliament that approves sending a large British army to Shanghai does not allow debate on matters that are widely discussed everywhere. But Foreign Minister Simon always believes that debating the current complex situation will not help. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>German Government Advises China and Japan</p>
<h3>To Cease Hostile Actions</h3>
<p>Berlin, The German government officially announced today that it has instructed its representatives in Tokyo and Nanjing to inform the Chinese and Japanese governments in a friendly manner that, in view of the recent developments in the Far East, the German government is participating in the proposals of other countries in order to restore a peaceful situation, that is, to stop all preparations for the war plan and to quickly end hostile actions, especially in Shanghai. The German government also agrees with the claim that China and Japan should start negotiations in the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations resolution of December 10. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Hankou, the Berliner Tageblatt reported that the British representative to Germany proposed at the League of Nations to also negotiate with Tokyo and Nanjing. However, Germany has abandoned its rights in China since the European War, so this negotiation did not specifically request protection of the International Settlement. The right-wing newspaper accused the government of saying that Germany's unity with the powers against Japan is of no benefit. The newspaper also said that Germany has actually completely resolved the issue of disarmament, but still pretends to be a great power on the surface. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<p>Ma Zhanshan and Others' Circular Telegram</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan and Others' Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>Hailun, Ma Zhanshan and others' circular telegram said, all newspapers, compatriots at home and abroad, please note: Our army resisted Japan previously with exhausted strength and no support, and temporarily withdrew to Hailun, one to reorganize the troops and unite with friendly forces to make a final struggle, and the other to hope for effective diplomacy, the Japanese side to realize and get a considerable solution. We are waiting for the time to come and are sworn to resist insults to the death. Our humble sincerity has been communicated and reported to you in the Jia telegram. Unexpectedly, the Japanese warlords are acting perversely, having already invaded our territory, destroyed the integrity of the political power, forcibly occupied the East Railway, and destroyed Eurasia's transportation. Recently, they have intensified their ferocity, the poisonous flow to the Northeast is surging, and the claws to the Southeast are spread out. They are using the rōnin strategy to resolve the aftermath of the Northeast and opening up a new situation in the Southeast with naval and land lewdness, doing everything they can. If their military force is reliable, then there will be no justice left in the world from now on. If our people's hearts are not dead, the whole country should unite and make sacrifices in the struggle. If the country is lost, where will the family be? The ancient teachings are clearly recorded, with no chance of luck. The national crisis is getting more urgent, and the responsibility is getting heavier. Zhanshan and others respectfully lead the troops to die to kill the enemy, thinking about this all the time, and have no choice but to ignore it. We only hope that our compatriots at home and abroad will jointly uphold the righteousness that every man is responsible, rise up to resist with all their strength, defeat them individually, and protect our children and grandchildren and return our mountains and rivers in one fell swoop. They have good weapons, and we have hot blood. Spirit will ultimately triumph over matter. The key to victory lies in determination. Disaster is imminent, so let's plan together. We also hope that friends from all countries will uphold justice, rein in and speak out. We can't help but look forward to it.

<p>British Reporter Visits Yoshizawa</p>
<h3>British Reporter Visits Yoshizawa</h3>
<p>London, The Tokyo correspondent of The Times met with Foreign Minister Yoshizawa yesterday. According to Yoshizawa, Japan's interests in Shanghai are the same as other countries, but Japan's economic and political interests in Manchuria are above those of other countries. Japan's position in Manchuria is the key to Japan's life and death. The Times said in an editorial this morning that Japan has established even greater rights to special treatment in Manchuria, which is different from Shanghai or other places in China. This is obvious. Japan wants to be the master of Manchuria even more. Japan claims to respect China's territorial and administrative integrity, but Shenyang has now become an independent country. This may be intentional, but this development is of course something that all countries that have signed treaties related to Manchuria cannot but pay attention to. Britain has special financial relations in Manchuria, and the losses caused by recent events to international trade are also something that the investigation team should investigate, and to what extent the open-door policy is now being implemented should also be investigated.

<p>Chen Mingshu</p>
<h3>Delivers Important Speech</h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army Resists for Righteous Defense</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central Committee member Chen Mingshu delivered an important speech on the 3rd, saying that the government is moving to Luoyang to prepare for a long-term struggle. As a member of the government, because the 19th Route Army is resisting the Japanese army's invasion in Shanghai for the righteous and glorious defense of the country, I will temporarily stay to represent the Central Government to comfort the army. I was deeply moved by the meeting with the officers and soldiers of the army in the past two days. I can speak on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the army. The army upholds the principle of legitimate defense and not giving an inch of land to others. People have the heart to die and are willing to sacrifice the whole body as the price for the survival of the nation and the revival of the country. They consistently obey the central government and maintain their integrity in order to fulfill the military's duty to serve the country. I don't know anything else. I also dare to say that this army will never fear any strong enemy that invades our territory, and will never leave the Beijing-Shanghai line even if it is all sacrificed. I firmly believe that other armies also hold the same spirit and ambition and are willing to serve the country. Although China's material science is behind others, it has a vast land and a large population, and it is an agricultural country. Relying only on this national spirit to defend the country with death will surely be able to achieve final victory in the long-term struggle. Therefore, we must give full play to the highest and unparalleled spirit of sacrifice in order to save ourselves. China is originally a country that loves peace. If the world still has justice, fairness, and the responsibility of international conventions, then we are happy to follow it, because we are sacrificing to resist violence, which is exactly the responsibility of justice, fairness, and international conventions. If there is this deep understanding in the international community and this deep awakening in the people, then we are also willing to seek world peace through diplomatic means, so that the international community knows who is responsible for destroying world peace (Special Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Chen Mingshu told people here today that the 19th Route Army has decided to fight against the invaders and will never retreat an inch of land. The location of the central government has been moved to Luoyang because it wants to fight to resist foreign invasion. The 19th Route Army is fighting hard in Shanghai to resist foreign insults. The soldiers of this army are willing to sacrifice their lives to fight for national survival. Although the Japanese army has superior combat power, my old troops will never easily abandon the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. I think other armies have the same idea as the 19th Route Army and are eager to serve the country. We are determined to continue the struggle until we win. But China is now accepting fair proposals that do not violate international law. If the powers understand who is guilty of disrupting world peace,</p>

<h3>Receives Capital Press</h3>
<p>Nanjing, He Yingqin received the press on the 3rd and reported, 1) The resistance of our army in Shanghai is to preserve the national and ethnic personality and the integrity of sovereignty and territory. On the one hand, we are still using diplomacy to require countries to fulfill their treaty responsibilities. At one time, foreign newspapers said that we will declare war on Japan. It is a misunderstanding. A declaration of war implies aggression. Defense is only resistance to unjust aggression. The meaning is completely different. 2) Our country is a country of reputation and civilization, and will never lightly start a war with any neighboring country. Even if there is a dispute with a neighboring country, if it can be resolved by diplomatic means, it will never easily resort to force, damaging its historical honor. 3) I dare to take responsibility to declare that I am responsible for guaranteeing the safety of Eastern and Western expatriates residing in Nanjing, and I am confident that I have the power to guarantee safety. I hope that expatriates from all countries and the general public will live and work in peace. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
