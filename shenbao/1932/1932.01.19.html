<h3>英美報紙譏評日本覆文</h3>
<p>英報以瘋犬喻日人</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本對於滿洲事件之復文、送達美國國務院後、美國輿論方面顯有不滿意之表示、華盛頓郵報今日載一論文、認日本之復文爲近代狡辯之傑構、並指斥日本外務省之勾結軍閥侵凌中國、該報稱、日本外務省之復文、實可宣示日本之眞實計劃、並可證明日外務省前此之推諉歸罪於軍人、爲毫無誠意、該報又謂倘日本人運用英文之字義、一如吾人所習知者、則日人實難以掩飾其心目中之眞意、然則日人何妨再進一步、而聲明日本之征服中國、即所以維持中國之門户開放、又何妨逕言中國必須受日本之征服、然後中國領土治權之完整、始可保存乎、或者日本之所欲者、爲併呑中國之全部而維持其獨立、亦未可知也、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）孟却斯德指導報今日以譏剌之論調、批評日本關於滿案答覆美國之文、謂國聯嘗盡其力之所能、以助日本安然破壞國聯會章、英國亦嘗盡其力之所能、以助日本安然破壞九國公約、獨美國在最後一分鐘忽不肯依公道行事、又謂日本之覆文、充滿日人之詼諧、例如文中謂日本如於滿洲之行政、有所干涉、則全由地方官大都棄職而逃、或辭職而去、此恰如瘋犬噬人而爲之辯護曰犬之噬人全因人見犬而逃耳、惜事實終不可掩飾也云云、（十八日路透社電）</p>

<h3>洛桑會議之前途彬</h3>
<p>自從凡爾賽和約成立以後賠欵與戰債問題使歐洲與美洲發生不可分離之連鎖關係在此關係之下全德意志人民旦夕呻吟宛轉榨其血汗以繳付無可數計之血的賠欵華盛頓政府則歡愉欣笑以按期接受血的債務其他如英如意如法如比以及許多曾參加瘋狂屠殺之「戰勝國」則恰爲此血的債務繳付與接受關係中之經理人。</p>
<p>由道威斯計劃以至楊格計劃雖已確定德國應付賠欵總額及年限使賠欵問題告一段落但於以貨物作抵則大受限制德國人民肩頭上之負担毫未减輕大戰結朿以後整個歐洲即長爲此一新的問題所苦悶同時且長爲唯一債權國之華盛頓政府所桎梏。</p>
<p>德國人民在鉅大數目債欵榨壓之下即吸一支烟飲一杯酒之代價之中。亦須担負數成之賠欵稅參加大戰之責任者今已死去而若子若孫仍不免於担負此一筆鉅大血賬之榨壓戰時之一切損失以歷年來德國忠實支付。應亦已付淸而且大戰以後英法比以及任何一國經歷長時期之休息大抵都已恢復其舊日之繁榮尤其幸運之美國以戰前之債務國戰後一躍而爲債權國且爲世界之大富豪獨有德國經濟爲人所把持工商業爲人所扼制。國際銀行之設立使德國人民成爲各債權國共管共同宰制下之奴𨽻一面按期榨取鉅大之賠欵而另一面則各自竭力提高其關稅壁壘使德國貨物遭受窒息此不僅爲一大矛盾大不平事而且在此矛盾與不平事之下由於德國之精疲力竭無法塡滿債權國之慾壑一切經濟之危機與政治之危機。即由而醖釀長成</p>
<p>去年六月間美總統荷佛爲挽救凋敝衰落之世界發表連環停付戰債一年之主張六月二十日美總統宣言正如晴空霹靂打破數年來國際間之沉悶局勢一般樂觀者且以此爲恢復世界繁榮之唯一途徑稱頌荷佛爲聰敏之債權人爲凋敝世界之救星然而以資本主義經濟恐慌之深刻與擴大戰債賠欵一年之連環停付并不足以紓解世界之困厄德國之枯竭如故世界之凋敝亦如故於是而今茲又有召集洛桑賠欵會議之計劃</p>
<p>洛桑會議原本擬於一月十八日召集復改二十五開幕今以英意主張完全取銷賠欵。而法則堅持反對態度。無法調和故。會期一展再展。前途正障礙重重。</p>
<p>法之反對取銷賠欵固自有其立塲一則以其所收自德國之賠欵多於其付於美國之戰債再則以法國現處於世界第二黃金之國其經濟勢力寖已可以控制歐洲彼不僅時時防德國之復興而且時時與英意鈎心鬥角爭歐洲大陸之霸權彼正以猛烈之勢吸收黃金且嘗毅然曰「沒有法國的協力什麽事都做不成」其對於德國則威力脅迫無所不至曾一再宣言德國要想請求金融的援助須先給以政治的保障」故法國之反對停付自爲勢所必至法人曾堅决表示謂取銷賠欵即無異於取消楊格計劃與凡爾賽和約。英意則正反乎是英與德旣曾經長時期之携手主張停付當更可見好於德雄心勃勃之意大利亦欲以此一主張結納於德而排法且停付於彼無損。又可藉以打破世界經濟之難關而挽救目前之困厄故意相莫索里尼於一月十五日曾親撰一文籲請美國取銷戰債英相麥唐納於一月十日亦發出益而各敲其如意算盤亦即由經濟危機之擴大進而形爲政治上之鈎心鬥角非厚於德人尤非作公理與人道之主張也</p>
<p>然而賠欵停付之能否實現究以美國爲其關鍵美國如肯勾銷戰債而此一主張又能得法國之贊助則戰債與賠欵一大問題或遂可就此一筆勾銷但美人固未必有如此之慷慨也美國會最近並曾通過議案反對戰債之减少减少且不許而况勾銷乎此固資本主義國家必有之態度絶非公理與人道之呼籲所能感動故今日打開此一大問題惟有兩根鎖鑰一法持之一則美持之鎖鑰固有之矣然而其如持鑰者不肯動手何</p>
<p>總之資本主義經濟動搖恐慌今已達到空前之深刻與擴大種種之險象種種之難題都使資本主義經濟學者束手坐視無以應付賠欵即此險象此難題之一德國已成枯竭血肉榨取已盡「沒有的東西呌人家拿來那是徒然的」故今後德國之再不能繳付賠欵自爲勢所必至然而由經濟的恐惶進而爲政治的恐慌歐洲將以此問題而重新燃燒戰禍之死灰進而燃燒世界當亦可能資本主義已呈現死相一切矛盾一切艱難都乘機而爆發在歷史的必然性之下資本主義之沒落亦將爲必然洛桑會議就能順利召集賠欵問題就能順利解决又能如此歷史之必然性何</p>

<p>自由談不庭齊谈除　夫薈從南京路說到南京城（下）　　我從「死人當路」慢慢的聯想到「病人當國」。政府是一部機器。機器上有一個螺絲釘，釘上銹了就得立刻換一個否則難免全部崩潰之危險。中央政治會議常務委員二人中就有兩位是害病。汪先生因病辭職如果是眞的生病，却是政治家應有之態度，害病而不辭職，勉强病人就職，都是絶大的錯誤。（又不生病，又不就職又不辭職當然也是一種錯誤。）允許這種錯誤之存在是中國人民公共之錯誤。前數日國府委員多數出京，使重要公事堆積不能處理的有九十餘件之多，便是勉强病人負責一念之差所使。我在大馬路等了一個多鐘頭最後吟得一首四言小詩『死人當路；病人當國··路走不通，國將不國？』我寫這首小詩不咎旣往，區區之意，只希望國人從此不再允許「死人當路」，不再勉强「病人當國」迎征服處女空飛機歸來  葉華女士同學孫惕新自美歸。供職歐亞航空公司。十三日約家人等往虹橋飛機塲。迎該公司第一號機。征服天山南北處女空。開拓航路凱旋安抵故鄕是日下午四時半。茲機翱翔雲漢。翻騰太空而來。見吾人揚巾脫帽。答以三週環行巡禮。三上三下。機身幾及地面。復轉靑雲。駕駛術之精熟。歎觀止焉。孫謂機師德人陸慈。Ｌｕｔｚ不特技藝高明。且賦性英豪。次次冒萬險飛西。非陸莫屬。蓋西北邊陲。危險特甚。多匪多盜。往往被刦。去歲該公司飛滿洲里一機途經蒙古被匪射擊。機師羅德傑Ｐａｔｂｊｅ高爾白Ｋｏｅｌｂｅｒ二人。負重傷堕沙漠中。陸慈自告奮勇。外出偵探。駕至羅高遇害處。匪又施故技。彈中氣管。幸未傷身。乃急臨高。疾飛至滿洲里。電俄馳救。斯時氣管旣損。油復僅二加倫。得免於難者。徼天之幸也。今日一號機得慶成功。未始非中國前途之一大暗示。嘗聞二人座機價六七千金。普通者萬金。蔣介石之水陸兩用機。値十餘萬。内部布置若游艇。寛敞逾常。一號機價値十一萬餘金。可載重量一萬七千克蘭姆。合二萬五千五百斤。每小時速率一百二十公里。昨年十二月二十日晨七時。自北平起程。行經歸化·綏遠·寗夏·甘肅·弱水河。二十二日午後三時抵新疆迪化。實破遠東空界紀錄。昔胡適之云。人家在天上飛。吾人在地下爬。人家巴黎到北平祇三十六小時。我人自甘肅赴北平。須一百零剃頭裁縫與官  陶在東剃頭。小技也。然不學不能。强爲之。則剝膚流血焉。今執途人而授之以刀剪曰。請爲我試一剃其人必皇然遜謝不敏。以未嘗學故。獨至於官。人人謀之。亦人人能爲之。絶未聞有遜謝者。是視官不剃頭若也。裁。縫亦小工也。而天下之衣於是乎成。今有一幅之呢。尋丈之帛。欲製爲衣任何子姪姻親同學同鄕恩知故舊。以曁大力薦牘之人。皆不肯委託。此無他。慮衣未成而吾之呢與帛先毁。耳獨至於官。惟上述諸人是任。是愛重官不如其愛惜幅呢與丈帛。其視官又不裁縫若也。四天。計二千五百小時。今則數千里之遙。歷二十餘小時得達。亦足以揚眉吐氣矣。　　此次携歸之名產。有眞駱駝絨毯一條。疆人徒手編成。中原未嘗見及。據云。玄冰裂地之西北。漁人披駱駝皮入水捕魚。不致　凉。皮貨藥材咸價廉物美。貨幣流行銀元寳。以兩爲單位。覩墨洋無不驚訝。視爲玩品。噫。際茲國難煎迫。中國屈無可屈。和無可和。惟有陷於長期間掙扎鬥爭。而積極經營西北。努力縮短邊陲距離。此民族生存必要之條件也。一號機之成功。豈僅一機之榮幸哉。藝海珍聞  庸熙藝術叛徒劉海粟。日前宴蔡孑民夫人周峻女士。及胡適之蔣夢麟任鴻雋周子競夫婦周廋鵑夫婦於存天閣。閣爲海粟畫室。藏海粟旅歐作品二百餘件。其中「但丁與維齊耳」摹本尤。巨圖爲描寫但丁神曲地獄篇傑搆。左方綠衣紅帽者爲但丁。其右紅衣掛冠者爲維齊耳。二哲輕舟共駛。而許多有罪者之寃魂。圍繞追擊。筋孿掙扎。病苦萬狀。繪地獄潛翳陰森之狀。令人毛骨悚然。其他海粟在羅馬·巴黎·威尼斯·比利時·所作傑搆甚多。蔡夫人均一一瀏覽。徘徊不去。蓋夫人亦油畫專家。研鑽有素。宜其高山流水。别具賞音。閣之左壁高懸康南海手書存天閣三字。四角在吳昌碩梁啓超譚組庵陳師曾書畫·諸人咸海粟故交。今均歸道山。海粟言下。不勝人琴之感。飲酣。周夫人與夢麟適之海粟對飲三酌。讌畢。更上海粟讀書樓。觀其所藏古畫及舊拓若干種。「夢麟見海粟所題座右銘。尤表同情。銘曰「實行自已相信的主張。怕人家攻繫而不做。或因人家不帮助而不做。都不是頂天立地的好漢。」夢麟更詢海粟何時立此信條。海粟答言方十七歲創立美專時所以自勗者。在座諸君。咸歎服不置觀卜拾雋  章疇昔之夜。訪友於新世界飯店。適相左未値。悵惘欲賦歸。行經鄰室。聞人聲喧闐。震人耳鼓。駐足以觀。瞥見幡然一老。精神　　。手指口道。爲人談相。兼卜六壬。余爲好奇心驅使。遂入室作壁上觀。初有一前某路督辦某君。匏繫滬濱。已歷年所爲謀差事請卜六壬能否償願卦得未時之傳卯寅丑。卜者曰。君豈爲謀鐵路差事乎。如然。一來復内必見部令。蓋卯發用卯爲舟車之官。靑龍居午由南興化李先生墓表（下）  陳天嬰先生嘗與臨桂况蕙風同應端制軍之聘。分撰匋齊藏石記。蕙風以詞名。與先生　嚮不同。每論文各有所持。積至不相能。蕙風氣盛。時時以言傾先生。先生則與爲慢罕而已。執貌彌恭。退謂人曰。文人自來相輕。小不孫於口則有之。顧其心寗有誰何耶。人以是稱其　度。晚年病痿。足不良行。遂尠出游存書數萬卷。家亦稍稍勝於昔。迺始移居興化原籍。蓋自僑寓鹽城。兩世岡養。或廢或興。已七十年矣。民國二十年某月某日告終里第。春秋七十有三。少日自字百藥生。亦號愧生晚更稱　叟著有選學拾瀋一卷愧生叢錄二卷學製齊駢文二卷游杭詩錄一卷丙寅懷人詩及游杭絶句各一卷世說小箋若干卷文心雕龍黃注補正若干卷顏氏家訓補注若干卷杜詩證選韓詩證選各若干卷拭觚脞語藥裹慵談等說部不列卷者若干種其爲人校定撰錄者於豐潤端忠敏有匋齋藏石記釋文於貴池劉氏於李集校記杜集校記南朝寺攷於海豐吳氏有姑溪集校本並釋文於仁和朱氏有劉賓客文集司空表聖文集校本於鎭洋繆氏有玉峯志太倉志校本於江陰繆氏有安祿山事蹟校記先生自壯及老。雖在疾疢困纏中。未嘗廢書。目所濡染。手即識之有日記八十餘册藏於家。夫人趙氏劉氏周氏皆慈明淑惠。子男五人長壬祐出嗣從父後次鴻祐次武祐次景祐次承祐女一人婉娟孫男八人女四人先生旣殉之某月。將葬其嗣某某等稱其先命書來謁文。嗚呼。天喪斯文。不愸孑遺。拓落人寰靈光盡矣。泣而書之。用誶當世悠悠行路。又疇述焉友人慈谿陳訓正表到北。得非津浦路乎。後閱報。其言果騐。爲時猶未出五日。繼之者爲曾綰度支之某次長。偕一某省財政廳長。因政變下台。就詢有無再起之望。經卜者據象而斷。頗中肯綮。而某次長者亦諳數理。甚譽卜者爲知言。卜者復笑語某廳長曰。君得非爲陳季常之信徒乎。君夫人命性之强項殊不下於河東獅。參君命理。今必尙抱伯道憂。然乎否乎。某廳長愀然謂信如君言。余豈將終爲若敖氏之鬼歟。卜者曰否。君行卯運五年中必誕寗馨。然積德行善。上應天心。在君好自爲之耳。某君傾服之餘不覺爲之磬折。曰願謹受敎。卜者乃烹茶添香。相與縱談天下事。臧否當世人物。妙緒泉湧。聞者傾服。余植立旁聽。不覺時移。見卜者吐屬風雅。不類尋常星相家。遂叩其生平。殊不知即係陽羨徐遂初道尹。余　齡時。即震其政聲。蓋徐宦游南北。足跡遍天下。任俠尙義。慷慨好客。無論識與不識。均深佩其爲人。余心儀其人。無緣識荊。詎其倦游歸來。竟效君平而隠於卜。以相天下事。可謂善游三昧知機之神也。短訉日前本欄刋有海客君之「一萬餘元一張照片」可謂極人世之榮譽。按此幀照片之奬金猶數倍於此。計得英國特奬一千金鎊。分類奬一百金鎊。及全世界攝影大比賽獎金一萬一千美金。總合墨幣約七萬餘元之多此偌大奬金。胥由柯達公司頒給。世界各國攝影比賽。亦由其主持。僅奬金一項。所耗計達十萬美金之多（夢）戎馬雙樓記（一四）  求幸福齊主人第二回談笑對良師傳噩耗家園遇刦零丁憐膩友慰悽情旅室生春魏卓謀道。他在公庽裹號哭了兩天。還是一點辦法也沒有。要想回家去辦後事。又恐怕土匪與他家的寃仇結得太深·下個斬草除根的毒手。於他本身都有不利。說是不回去罷。不獨家事沒法收拾。就是他一個人孤單單的困居在北京。也不是個長久之計今早我從旁處接著了這個消息。特到他公庽去看望他。他拉住我的手只哭。眼眶全腫得像胡桃大呢。梁笑雲忽地跳起來道。不行。他不能就回家去。他家只剩下他這一個人了。那好還去冒這種大危險。我與他總算是很好的朋友。他在這爲難的時候。我應該親去安慰他一回。并勸阻他不要輕舉妄動。多多保重自已身體。有什麽爲難的處所。我也還能儘我的力量。替他帮帮忙呀。說著。就急忙呌娘姨忙與伊預備洗臉水以及出門的衣服和鞋子。旋又吩咐打電話呌汽車。一時揩面換衣裳。忙得個不得開交。又一面對魏卓謀說道。。勞你駕你陪我去一趟。好嗎。魏卓謀想了想道。你這樣熱心爲朋友。使我佩服得很。當然應該奉陪的。只是今天下午我還有點别的事。送你到公庽門口。我欲郤就要告辭。梁笑雲此時也無暇多與他再說。怱怱忙忙裝扮就緒。恰好汽車也呌到在大門外只響喇叭。就拖了魏卓謀往外直跑道·我們就走。二人踉蹌著上了汽車。由魏卓謀代吩咐了一個地址。汽車便向大安公庽那條街如飛駛去梁笑雲坐在車中。只瞪直一雙滴溜溜的圓眼珠。逼視着前面汽車夫的背影。好像是一顆心怦怦亂跳。老嫌這汽車夫開車的速度還不算很快。直恨不得要連聲催促。一飛就飛到了目的地才好。魏卓謀見伊無心答理。便只好悶坐在一隅。也不作聲。好容易這汽車驀地停住了。梁笑雲頭一個急忙跳下來抬頭一看。果是大安公寓。伊以前原也來過這裹一兩次。安玉田的房間是坐落在那一個院落裏。伊又不是不熟。就顧不得與後面的魏卓謀打招呼。逕自推開大門就往裹直闖。及走到安玉田的房門口。見房門是半開着。伊也不管那裹面有沒有旁人。以及安玉田在不在家。加緊脚步。又是一頭闖了進去。到裹面一看靜悄悄的十分慘悽。只有安玉田一個人獨守在這空房裹并見他是和衣打横躺在床上。身子挺得逼直。將一本破書蒙住了臉。敎人看不出他是否在呑聲飲泣。抑或是昏沈入睡。但憑着他身上那一件灰靑色中山呢的袍子。和宕在床沿邊一雙脚所穿的中山牌橡皮鞋。郤判斷得出定是安玉田無疑。不由就走到床前衝口喚道。玉田。你怎麽啦。那躺在床上的安玉田。本沒睡着。聞聲便順手將一部書從臉上摘下來。微微抬起頭向伊看了一眼。就趕忙一躍而起道。你怎麽來的·</p>

<p>申報本埠增刋ＩP&gt;中華民國二十一年一月十九日星期二小論壇家庭慘劇幸中國的家庭時常發生慘劇，已成「司空見慣」的現象。隨手把昨天本報本埠新聞打開一看，就可以發現三件關於中國家庭特有的慘劇，一件事是虹橋路農民顧蘭州的長子寳根向父强索田契向父開槍；一件是已故沈少泉胞弟穉泉控告寡嫂傅氏侵占鉅欵；還有一件是本地人徐金梅與其長子永年因生活艱難同時服毒，這三件事的性質不大相似，但是慘劇的造成，都是爲了金錢和財產。中國的家庭有一個特點，即是親屬同居的大家庭制度，這種制度一方面是由於血統關係，一方面是由於經濟關係，尤以經濟的關係更爲重要，因爲稍有資產之家，一家之中只要有一個人賺錢，妻室兒女父母兄弟祖父祖母以至於岳父岳母舅爺外甥一大羣的人靠一個人養活。假如這一個賺錢的人一口氣不來，沒有遺產，就會使靠他養活的人餓死，有些財產，就不免引起兄弟叔伯哥嫂妯娌大爭遺產，不是一塲全武行的大打出手，就是對簿公堂，這都是由於中國家庭的不分家的惡習造成的。例如沈少泉假如在生前和他們的胞弟早已分家析產死後免了一塲叔嫂爭產官事。顧蘭州早知長子寳根不肖無法敎育，立即逐出，不必替他娶妻分產，還可以免得飽受三槍的虚驚。徐金梅和他的長子永年失業不過六七月之久，次子永寰尙有作汽車夫，每月還有數十元之收入，又何至於窮得要自殺？在這家人的父子兄弟之間想必有一番意氣的爭執，大槪難免不是因氣忿之故。總之，把許多中國家庭的悲歡離合的經過情形加以統計比較，所得的結果，無不是「殺狗散塲」，所以中國的家庭倘使照西人的辦法子女成人即行分居，兄弟娶室，各立門户，夫妻同居，財產各别，大槪可以减少許多家庭的慘劇了！大衆文藝遼西夢絲天還沒有破曉，她忽醒了。驀然間，記起了她的丈夫，爲了一腔熱血，投筆從戎到今天已近一個月了還沒有消息。雖說家中不憂衣食，雖說國事重於家事，但她總有些捨不得他，更望他能早日平安歸來。朦朧間，她忽聽得窓外她的小姑在喊着說··「嫂嫂，快些起來，哥哥有電報來了！」她便趕緊下床，走出房門去，將電報接了過來，一看，上面有這幾句話··「倭已退，余傷臥瀋醫院中，速來。夫白。」她不及收拾什麽·就此動身，一霎時，比飛機還快，便到了她的丈夫身邊。她見他一腿綁在夾板中，直挺挺的躺在床上，眼睛閉着，面容灰白，滿帶着失血過多和精神疲憊的神氣，比了平日完全換了一個人的樣子。她心頭一陣大痛，就跪下去伏在他的床邊，嗚咽的哭將起來。他微微的將眼睛開了一下，似乎輕輕的呼了一口氣，便將手緩緩的移到她的頭上撫着她的頭髮，低低的，一氣半氣的說··「不要丨哭，我心裹快樂極了··我盡了我報國的素心，眼見得還我河山，我可以說不虚此行了·········雖然我受了些傷，那也是應該的，暴骨沙塲的還不知有多少人呢，·········現在你又來了，好·········」她一句話也沒有，只是嗚嗚的哭着。「啊！不要哭了，起來罷，」她的丈夫又繼續的說，「告訴我，你這些日子，在家怎樣過的。」這一問，不料格外引起了她的哭勁，她好似有什麽委屈的，一發放聲大哭起來。可是剛一放聲，她却就此醒了，天還只恰恰亮着，只聽得聰俊的小姑，正在隔壁房裹讀書哩。大衆科學每人一天吃多少空氣？  冰冰瑩瑩··「你一天吃幾頓飯？每頓吃幾碗？」淸淸··「我一天吃三頓，一頓吃兩碗，一共吃六碗。」瑩瑩··「你一天吃幾次空氣，每次吃多少碗？」淸淸··「我不知道，請你告訴我。」瑩瑩·「我不告訴你，我敎你自已查出來，你自然知道了。好，我們先看看一分鐘要吃幾吃空氣。你數你自已的呼吸，一呼一吸，爲一次。要做平常的呼吸，不要太快，也不要太慢。你在心裏數，不必出聲。我看錶，到了一分鐘，我就呌你停下。看一分鐘，你呼吸幾次。好，動手數你的呼吸吧！····一分鐘到了，你呼吸了幾多次？」淸淸··「三十次。」瑩瑩··「你一分鐘要吃三十次空氣，一點鐘要吃多少次？」淸淸··「用六十分鐘乘三十次，那麽每點鐘，我要吃一千八百次空氣」瑩瑩··「你一天吃多少次空氣？」淸淸··「每天二十四小時，要吃空氣四萬三千二百次。」瑩瑩··「你可知道每次要吃多少空氣？」淸淸··「我不知道，請你也敎我做一個試騐吧！」瑩瑩··「好你拿一個醬油瓶，一盆水，一只中號飯碗，一根彎曲玻璃管來。這根彎曲玻璃管，一頭長，一頭短長的一頭要比醬油瓶長一點。」淸淸··「一起都拿來了。」瑩瑩··「你把彎曲玻璃管長的一頭，插進醬油瓶内，再把醬油瓶倒過來，罩在面盆的水裏，再把玻璃管短的一頭，放在口中，用嘴和管吸瓶内的空氣，用鼻子呼氣，吸一次後即用舌尖閉住短管口，再用鼻子呼氣。要用平常的呼吸，看你要呼吸幾次，才能把瓶内的空氣呼完。你做呼吸，我替你數····你看你吸了十八次，差不多把瓶裹的空氣都吸光了。」淸淸··「醬油瓶裏，怎麽裝滿了水呢？」瑩瑩··「瓶内空氣被你吸去，水被大氣壓了進來，佔了空氣的地位。所以如果你知道進來了多少水，就知道你吃了多少空氣。我們把瓶内的水，倒在碗裏一量就知道吃了幾碗空氣。我們拿碗量量看。····正好三碗水。你十八次，吃了三碗空氣。呼吸六次要吃空氣一碗。你一天要吃多少碗空氣？　　淸淸··「每天呼吸四萬三千二百次，六次吃一碗用六次來除，那麽一天我要吃七千二百碗空氣。」街頭社會學上海的弄堂  心秀上海眞是罪惡的淵藪，什麽姦淫搶刦，傷風敗俗的勾當，都疊見累出。所以有許多人說；「住在上海的靑年男女，比較内地容易堕落的最大原因，就是自幼耳濡目染，受了不良的環境影響」這話是很對的，你看那些弄堂裏，一天到晚，賣各種食品的小販，都源源而來，什麽五香豆啊，油豆腐啊，橘子啊，橄欖啊······若是小孩多的話，這弄堂裹一天至少要化去幾千錢，而使兒童們漸漸的養成好吃閒食，和耗費金錢的惡習，非但太不經濟，而且小孩們零碎食品吃多了，反而减少正當的飯食，影響到他們身體的康健。至於那些有紅綠顏色的糖，更於衛生有很大的妨碍。最壞的是那用木盤旋轉，做輸贏的糖擔子，什麽頭彩，二彩，最易引起兒童的僥倖心，和賭博的動機。這是應該禁止的啊！有時弄堂裹還來些拉胡琴，唱曲子的男人或女人，他們高唱些卑鄙齷齪的小調，什麽十八摸啊，打牙牌啊，四季相思啊，這種不堪入耳的淫詞浪曲，使初解人事，智識半開的靑年男女聽了，又將受到怎樣的影響呢？唉！古時孟母三遷也爲的是環境關係，現在我們住在這萬惡的上海，滔滔皆是，眞是遷不勝遷，但「防微杜漸」總得請大家注意一下，ＩP&gt;東南西北燻魚與酥糖  樂山只要是在上海住過一兩天的人，當然看見過那每條馬路上都有的燈火輝煌的糖果店吧？不是「稻香村」，就是「老大房」，也有用别的名字作招牌的，然以襲用上面兩種名字的居多數。而在這種店子的兩旁，照例是有兩塊斗大字的市招，牌子上面刻的是「燻魚」「酥糖」。我十年前初到上海的時候對於這千篇一律的這兩塊牌子發生懷疑，糖食店裏所賣的貨色，不是有百種以上麽？爲什麽單單要刻上「燻魚」「酥糖」呢？一二家刻上這種牌子並不爲稀奇，爲什麽大家千篇一律的掛上一樣的牌子呢？這裹面一定有原故原故在燻魚與酥糖在上海人的生活中，佔着重要性。不解這疑惑者數年之久，光陰過得快，不覺在上海住上十年了，這疑惑也隨着我的社會經騐的增長而解决了；因爲是··燻魚，是最合宜於下粥的小菜一般「以晝作夜」的度着眞正上海生活的姨太太，妓女，賭徒，烟鬼之流，深夜常用壎魚以佐粥，壎魚生意焉得不好？酥糖，是烟鬼的嗜好品，當那烟癮過足之後，一杯濃茶，兩包酥糖，大有「飄飄欲仙之槪」酥糖生意又焉得而不好？研究上海生活的社會學家，切不可以壎魚與酥糖之微小而忽之，牠是上海生活的一面鏡子呀！上海故事上海故事（十三）  周容編譯Ｘ租界内最初數年外人的生活狀况租界的外僑的人口漸漸增加。一八四四年只有五十人，次年增至九十人，五年之後，即增至一百七十五人。此外尙有從外船登岸暫時停住的人口很不少。從外人的眼光看來，上海比較廣州自然是他們的天堂，廣州的洋商都侷促在幾家商行之内，而上海却有這樣廣闊的租界給他們住，他們所感覺得美中不足的，即是他們不能走到租界以外一日不能回轉的鄕下去打獵。馬路埠頭委員會最初感受了不少的困難，因爲租界内的本地居民對於市政與公共事業的建設毫無經騐，這是不必諱言的。本地的居民最初只要有幾處碼頭可以泊船以及上下貨物就感覺得很滿足了，還沒有知道馬路的重要，以爲從前的泥路，可以供苦力搬運絲包與茶箱就夠了。到了開闢馬路的時候，决定馬路至少要二十五英尺寛，在當時看起來，似乎是太寛了一點。因爲馬路的路線要跟着河岸曲折所以外灘一帶的馬路比較的彎曲。當初建造洋房的時候，在建築方面毫無美術的意味，這種建築物，外人稱之曰「買辦式」的建築法。這些洋房多半是單層的平房，每楝房子都有走廊。這種平房原來是印度式的，本只可以適宜於熱帶的氣候，這種「買辦式」的房屋的建築者，心目中似乎專只在怎樣防避四個月夏季的驕陽酷署，却疏忽了夏季之外數個月之中屋内的陽光的重要。對於公共衛生也還不曾注意到，租界内的拉圾是倒在江邊的岸上。市塲訊聯益公司來函本公司新由美廠運至靈便瀝水器具，如持該器插入自來水龍頭能將自來水頓時瀝淸，每具現售洋十七元半，如蒙惠購，請至南京路香粉弄口聯益貿易公司採辦可也，</p>

<h3>The Righteous and Brave Army Rely on Strategic Locations to Vigorously Resist the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The Japanese Dispatch Wang Dianzhong's Bandit Troops to Fight Against the Righteous and Brave Army</p>
<p>Japanese Troops on Hongluo Mountain Begin to Retreat Towards Jinzhou</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Jinxi Campaign, the Japanese army repeatedly made light advances and was surrounded. Since the 15th, the division headquarters of the Chamber Division has repeatedly sent reinforcements from Jinzhou. The Righteous and Brave Army relied on the strategic terrain of the mountains and valleys, ambushing and fighting at night, gaining a considerable advantage. Therefore, Honjo has decided to change his plan, intending to transfer the Chamber Division to the Xinmin, Dahushan, and Liaoyang areas to cooperate with the Domin Division. Another decision was made to transfer all of Wang Dianzhong's bandit troops, who had seized Bu Kui, to Jinzhou to confront our infantry and cavalry units and the Righteous and Brave Army. On the 17th, the Lin Da Detachment and the Koga Regiment from the Hongluo Mountain area began to retreat towards Jinzhou under the cover of artillery fire. It is expected that Wang Dianzhong's bandit troops will arrive and be able to engage in battle today or tomorrow. There have been intense engagements all along the Beining branch line from the Daughter River to Dayao Ditch. The Japanese air force is fully bombing the Righteous and Brave Army in the Nuanchi Pond area of Hongluo Mountain, causing considerable casualties. Furthermore, Wang Dianzhong's bandit troops, who had seized Bu Kui, previously received an order from the Japanese army headquarters in Shenyang to depart for Jinzhou to garrison. Since the 17th, they have been transported in batches by train from the Tao'ang Railway Bureau. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has transferred a large number of reinforcements from Shenyang, advancing along the Datong and Jinzhou-Chaoyang lines. The Japanese troops in the Hongluo Mountain and Nuanchi Pond area were surrounded by our Righteous and Brave Army last night, suffering heavy casualties. The remnants retreated towards the Daughter River area of Jinzhou this morning, intending to connect with reinforcements in the rear and launch another large-scale attack. Furthermore, the battles on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang branch line are still fierce. The Righteous and Brave Army is moving from Hongluo Mountain towards Jinzhou, disrupting the flanks of the Japanese army, causing panic among the people of Jinzhou. (18th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Due to the rapid increase in the number of the Righteous and Brave Army in western Liaoning and the repeated defeats of the Japanese army, the Tokyo government has decided to transfer all of the Korean Garrison Army to the Northeast, and to further dispatch an inland division to increase military strength, in order to implement the plan to quell the resistance. It is planned to launch the attack after the inland division arrives. Therefore, the Japanese troops along the Datong line and Jinzhou-Chaoyang line are temporarily suspending their offensive posture. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Corpses Have Now Been Found</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) After the Matsuo Transport Team went missing, a certain brigade of the mixed team organized a search team to try their best to find their whereabouts. Yesterday, the corpses of Lieutenant Matsuo and 30 others were found east of Jinxi. (17th United Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Jinghui Mediates the Political Disputes in Jilin Province</p>
<h3>Sincerely Promises to Send Representatives to Harbin</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Jinghui invited Yunlai to Harbin to discuss peaceful compromise with Jin Wuxuan, the representative of Xi Qia. Cheng replied by telegram, sending Xu Zi, the director of the Finance Department, as his representative to come. He is expected to arrive in Harbin on the 20th. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 16th, foreign reporters went to Binzhou to visit Acting Chairman Cheng Yun. According to him, "My coming here to form a government was a clear order from the central government. Now, I only listen to orders. I have long put my personal life and death out of my mind. The staff who come here to work are mostly ambitious people who are not afraid of difficulties and all have a spirit of sacrifice. After the Japanese planes dropped bombs, not only did the original staff not disperse, but more ambitious people from all over came to join us. The brigade commanders of the Jilin army are mostly my old comrades-in-arms of Marshal Zhang Zuolin and are all very reliable." (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Gao Qidong, the director of the Binjiang Public Security Bureau, resigned and Xi Qia sent someone to take over. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) After Zhang Jinghui went to Qiqihar to take office as governor, he has now returned here. Zhang did not mention whether General Ma Zhanshan attended the ceremony. This shows that the two sides have not yet reached an agreement. A portion of Ma's army is still intact, so it is feared that there will still be battles in Heilongjiang. A few days ago, the police bureau here sent a representative to the Harbin Long-Distance Bus Owners Association, falsely requesting 30 buses to transport troops from Harbin to Ashihe. The association refused, and the police bureau forcibly requisitioned the buses. The association immediately protested to Zhang Jinghui, who ordered the cars to be returned. However, a few hours later, the police bureau and several military officers requisitioned more buses, up to 30 or more, to transport troops to Ashihe. The current power of the new Jilin provincial government cannot reach the Eastern Province Special Region, so it feels very distressed. It is said that the commander of the special region, Ding Chao, and the police chief of the special region, Wang Ruihua (transliteration), do not want to join the new provincial government. If the provincial government uses force to expel them, it is feared that there will be battles in Harbin. Although someone is mediating, Ding and others have a firm attitude and will not yield. According to Japanese sources, Yu Shenzheng is currently leading seven brigades of the provincial government's troops, stationed between Yimianpo and Ashihe. Ding Chao's troops are about three brigades. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Yu Shencheng's rebellious army could not bear to kill their own people and many deserted, disobeying orders. The bandit army of Ma Xilin's unit detoured to Taolaizhao on the 16th, still intending to attack the 24th Brigade.

<h3>The Japanese Side is Eager to Establish a New Manchu Regime</h3>
<p>The Pseudo-Republic is Scheduled to be Established on the Lunar New Year's Day</p>
<p>Because the various factions in Beiping and Shenyang are fighting fiercely and the Japanese army in Rehe has not yet occupied the area, this is a hidden danger. Therefore, the establishment of the Manchu-Mongolian independence group has been delayed. Currently, the Japanese side is mediating between the various factions and actively attacking Rehe. The Japanese hope to maintain neutrality in other countries.</p>

During this national crisis, everyone is willing to do their best to help the government overcome this difficulty. Mr. Wang and Chiang have expressed their responsibility after meeting and discussing in Hangzhou. This personal urging of President Sun should make it no problem for them to come to Nanjing. He said that after Chiang returned to Fenghua, he was still responsible for all party and national affairs, both domestic and foreign, and had not been idle at all. Now, after urging from all parties, and with the national crisis becoming more and more urgent, he has agreed to go to Nanjing with Wang in one or two days to jointly save the country. Hu Yinsheng is not fully recovered from his illness, and the journey is long, so it may take a few days later.

<p>(Hong Kong) The four pacification zone committees of Guangdong Province, Yu Xiang, Li Chen, etc., temporarily suspended their inauguration on the 18th because Hu, Yu, Xiao, and others were still discussing the issue of the three institutions in Hong Kong. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Executive Department held its second standing committee meeting on the 18th. Chen Ce and Zhang Huichang did not attend. The discussion on reorganizing the three institutions lasted for two hours and was still undecided. It needs to be discussed in detail after Xiao and Deng return to the province. A secretary of the association said that the abolition of the three institutions is out of the question. What remains to be discussed is only to reduce their powers or change their names appropriately. Xiao and Deng are expected to return to the province on the 19th. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xiao, Deng, and others discussed with Hu the major plans to deal with the current situation.

Hu replied to Wang and Xiao's telegram on the 18th, saying that at this time, the only way to save the country and the people is to work hard on the two major tasks of resisting Japan and suppressing communists. Although I am ill, I have repeatedly telegraphed to my comrades in Nanjing and Shanghai, urging them to be loyal and let Brother Zhesheng and others exercise the powers of the responsible cabinet and implement its policies. And we, as ordinary people, will sincerely support them. Then, both internally and externally, there will be a chance for recovery. What you mentioned in your telegram about jointly supporting the precarious situation is no more than this. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong According to Guangzhou news, the provincial government committee members proved after the memorial week today that the existence of the Southwest Kuomintang Executive Committee and the Political Affairs Committee is legitimate. According to reports, the two committees have repeatedly been said to be abolished, but the word "abolish" was not mentioned at all in today's weekly meeting. The members also said that the establishment of the two committees was permitted by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou, so it is legal. As for the interception of customs duties in Guangzhou, the truth is unclear. This issue is very complicated, and no information can be obtained from officials. The authorities have warned customs officials not to discuss this matter, otherwise they will be dismissed from their positions. Hu Hanmin issued a declaration today, saying that there are still many responsible leaders in Nanjing today, so even if Chiang and Wang and others are not in Nanjing, the affairs of the central government will not be hindered. He is ill and needs to rest, so he cannot go to Nanjing for the time being, etc. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Investigation Team May Not Achieve Anything</h3>
<p>Its Report Will Have Little Impact</p>
<p>The Attitudes of Various Countries Are Already Clear</p>
<p>Tokyo Foreign observers in Liaoning today expressed their opinions, believing that when the League of Nations investigation committee arrives in Liaoning to investigate, they will see a fait accompli and their report will have very little impact on Japan's future Manchurian and Mongolian policies. When the investigation team arrives in Liaoning, the puppet government created by Japan through its power will have completed its control of Manchuria and Mongolia. Therefore, in terms of the results that can be hoped for at present, the League of Nations representatives will only travel around, see and hear, and record what they have observed. Japan's work to consolidate its control over the Northeast will continue unabated. Moreover, it will not have a major impact on the policies of major European and American countries. The United States' policy has been clearly expressed in Stimson's notes to China and Japan. Although the United Kingdom does not have a concrete method like the United States, its policy is almost equally clear. The British government has expressed most of the same direction as the United States in a brief statement. Portugal, as an ally of the United Kingdom, has announced that it will adopt the same policy as the United Kingdom. The Netherlands has a more obscure attitude, but on the whole, it will also express sympathy for the United States. Therefore, it is expected that the countries will only continue to express their extreme disapproval of Japan's actions and will not recognize Japan's sophistry of not infringing on China's administrative integrity.

<h3>British and American Newspapers Criticize Japan's Reply</h3>
<p>British Newspaper Compares the Japanese to Mad Dogs</p>
<p>(Washington) After Japan's reply regarding the Manchurian Incident was delivered to the US State Department, American public opinion showed dissatisfaction. The Washington Post published an article today, recognizing Japan's reply as a masterpiece of modern sophistry, and denounced the Japanese Foreign Ministry's collusion with the warlords to invade China. The newspaper claimed that Japan's Foreign Ministry's reply could declare Japan's true plans and prove that the Japanese Foreign Ministry's previous excuses blaming the military were insincere. The newspaper also said that if the Japanese used the meaning of English words as we are accustomed to, then it would be difficult for the Japanese to conceal the true meaning in their minds. Then, why not go a step further and declare that Japan's conquest of China is to maintain China's open door, and why not directly say that China must be conquered by Japan before the integrity of Chinese territorial jurisdiction can be preserved? Or, perhaps what Japan wants is to annex all of China and maintain its independence, which is also unknown. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian criticized Japan's reply to the United States regarding the Manchurian case with a satirical tone, saying that the League of Nations had tried its best to help Japan safely violate the League of Nations Covenant, and the United Kingdom had also tried its best to help Japan safely violate the Nine-Power Treaty. Only the United States suddenly refused to act fairly at the last minute. It also said that Japan's reply was full of Japanese humor, such as the sentence in the article that Japan's interference in Manchurian administration was entirely due to the fact that local officials mostly deserted or resigned. This is just like a mad dog biting someone and defending itself by saying that the dog bit someone entirely because the person saw the dog and ran away. Unfortunately, the facts cannot be concealed, etc. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Leaves Russian Capital</h3>
<p>Sino-Russian Conference Completely Stalled</p>
<p>(Moscow) Mo Dehui, the plenipotentiary representative of our country to the Sino-Russian Conference, departed from Moscow tonight to return to his country. Since the Liaoning case occurred on September 18 last year, the Sino-Russian Conference has not been suspended, but it has actually come to a standstill. The most recent meeting between Plenipotentiary Mo and Deputy Foreign Commissioner Karakhan was still on the 20th of October last year. In the current situation, before the Liaoning case between China and Japan is resolved, the issue of the China-Eastern Railway between China and Russia may not be resolved immediately. Therefore, Mr. Mo took the opportunity to return to China to discuss everything with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (17th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Future of the Lausanne Conference</h3>
<p>Ever since the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles, the issue of reparations and war debts has caused an inseparable chain relationship between Europe and the Americas. Under this relationship, all the German people have been groaning and struggling day and night, having their blood and sweat squeezed out to pay countless blood debts. The Washington government is happy and smiling, accepting blood debts on a regular basis. Other countries such as England, Italy, France, Belgium, and many other "victorious countries" that participated in the insane slaughter are simply managers in the relationship of paying and accepting this blood debt.</p>
<p>From the Dawes Plan to the Young Plan, although the total amount and time limit of German reparations have been determined, making the reparations issue come to an end, the use of goods as collateral has been greatly restricted, and the burden on the shoulders of the German people has not been reduced at all. Since the end of the war, the entire Europe has been troubled by this new problem and has been shackled by the Washington government, which is the sole creditor.</p>
<p>Under the pressure of huge debts, even the cost of smoking a cigarette or drinking a glass of wine by the German people must bear several percent of the reparations tax. Those responsible for participating in the war have now died, but their children and grandchildren still cannot escape the pressure of this huge blood debt. All the losses of the war, along with the faithful payment of Germany over the years, should have been paid off. Moreover, after the war, England, France, Belgium, and any other country that experienced a long period of rest have generally restored their former prosperity. The United States, in particular, is fortunate to have leapt from a debtor nation before the war to a creditor nation after the war and has become the world's wealthiest country. Only the German economy is controlled by others, and its industry and commerce are controlled by others. The establishment of international banks has made the German people slaves under the joint management and common domination of various creditor nations, squeezing huge amounts of reparations on a regular basis. On the other hand, they are all trying to raise their tariff barriers to stifle German goods. This is not only a great contradiction and injustice, but under this contradiction and injustice, due to Germany's exhaustion and inability to fill the desires of the creditor nations, all economic and political crises are brewing and growing.</p>
<p>In June of last year, US President Hoover, in order to save the declining world, proposed a one-year moratorium on war debts. On June 20, the US President's declaration broke the international atmosphere that had been depressing for several years like a thunderbolt in the clear sky. Optimists even regarded this as the only way to restore world prosperity, praising Hoover as a wise creditor and a savior of the declining world. However, with the deepening and expansion of the capitalist economic panic, the one-year moratorium on war debts and reparations is not enough to alleviate the world's predicament. Germany's exhaustion remains the same, and the world's decline remains the same. Thus, there is now a plan to convene the Lausanne Reparations Conference.</p>
<p>The Lausanne Conference was originally scheduled to be convened on January 18, but was changed to the 25th for the opening. Now, due to England and Italy's advocacy of completely abolishing reparations, and France's insistence on opposition, it is impossible to reconcile. Therefore, the conference period has been postponed again and again. The future is full of obstacles.</p>
<p>France's opposition to the abolition of reparations has its own position. On the one hand, the reparations it receives from Germany are more than the war debts it pays to the United States. On the other hand, France is currently the second largest gold country in the world, and its economic power is gradually controlling Europe. It not only prevents Germany's revival at all times, but also constantly engages in infighting with England and Italy to compete for hegemony in the European continent. It is absorbing gold at a fierce pace and has firmly said, "Nothing can be done without France's cooperation." Its coercion and threats to Germany have been all-encompassing and has repeatedly declared that Germany must provide political guarantees before it can request financial assistance. Therefore, France's opposition to suspension is inevitable. The French have resolutely stated that abolishing reparations is tantamount to abolishing the Young Plan and the Treaty of Versailles. England and Italy are the opposite. England and Germany have been working hand in hand for a long time and advocating suspension, which can be seen as more favorable to Germany. Italy, with its ambitious ambitions, also wants to use this proposal to win over Germany and exclude France. Moreover, suspension will not harm Italy and can be used to break through the world's economic difficulties and save the current predicament. Therefore, Mussolini personally wrote an article on January 15, appealing to the United States to abolish war debts. British Prime Minister MacDonald also issued a statement on January 10, each calculating their own abacus. This is the expansion of the economic crisis leading to political infighting. It is not out of kindness to the German people, let alone out of justice and humanitarianism.</p>
<p>However, whether the suspension of reparations can be realized is ultimately determined by the United States. If the United States is willing to write off war debts and this proposal can be supported by France, then the major problem of war debts and reparations may be written off in one stroke. But the Americans may not be so generous. The US Congress recently passed a bill opposing the reduction of war debts. How can they be cancelled if they are not allowed to be reduced? This is the inevitable attitude of capitalist countries and cannot be moved by appeals to justice and humanity. Therefore, today there are only two keys to unlock this major problem, one is held by France and the other is held by the United States. The keys are there, but what if the key holders refuse to act?</p>
<p>In short, the capitalist economic turmoil and panic have now reached unprecedented depths and expansions. All kinds of dangerous signs and all kinds of difficult problems have made capitalist economists sit and watch without being able to cope. Reparations are one of these dangerous signs and difficult problems. Germany has become exhausted, and its flesh and blood have been squeezed out. "It is futile to ask people to take out what they do not have." Therefore, Germany's inability to pay reparations in the future is inevitable. However, from economic panic to political panic, Europe will use this issue to rekindle the ashes of war and possibly ignite the world. Capitalism has shown signs of death, and all contradictions and all difficulties are taking the opportunity to explode. Under the inevitability of history, the decline of capitalism will also be inevitable. Even if the Lausanne Conference can be convened smoothly and the reparations issue can be resolved smoothly, what is the inevitability of history?</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Regarding the External Authorities' Opinions on Japan's Reply to the US Note</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 18th, a responsible official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed his opinion on the content of Japan's reply to the US note, saying that Japan's reply stated that the effectiveness of the Open Door Policy in the Manchurian region was greatly reduced due to the unstable situation in the Three Eastern Provinces of China, including Manchuria. This is evidenced by Japan's repeated declarations that it had spared the entire region of Manchuria from civil war and turmoil, which is known to be a fabrication. As for the claim that the effectiveness of the Open Door Policy in Manchuria has been greatly affected, if this is true, the reason is actually Japan's active pursuit of its economic aggression. This economic aggression is part of Japan's policy of partitioning Manchuria. The Japanese note also stated that the current unstable and chaotic situation in China was unforeseen by the countries attending the Washington Conference, so the Nine-Power Treaty needs to be revised in its application. This is just an excuse for Japan to violate the treaty. If this statement is considered reasonable, then the fact that the Japanese government has no control over its General Staff and the troops stationed in the Three Eastern Provinces was also unforeseen by the countries at the Washington Conference, and can be considered a reason for Japan to violate the treaty. The reason is that the countries at the Washington Conference originally regarded the Japanese government as a modern, organized government that could absolutely obtain the obedience of its army. However, the appalling facts of the Japanese in Manchuria are sufficient to prove that the so-called Japanese government that used to communicate with various countries was not the real Japanese government, and the real Japanese government is the General Staff in Japan, that is, the successor of the Shogunate (the Shogun's office during the era of military dictatorship before the Meiji Restoration). The Japanese note mentioned that the happiness and security of Manchuria and the convenience of general trade are regarded by the Japanese people as insignificant and very important. This statement is indeed true because the Japanese consider these two to be of utmost concern and very important because Manchuria is rich in raw materials and is a key route for Japan's invasion of China. The Japanese General Staff has long regarded the war to conquer the Pacific as inevitable, and preparing for war, there is no way to take it without passing through Manchuria. I am deeply afraid that the Tokyo General Staff, which inherited the Shogunate and actually governs Japan, will repeat the old trick of provoking China and Russia in the past, and plan and prepare for war against China.

<h3>Central Government Decides to Adopt Austerity Policy</h3>
<p>All Agencies Re-prepare Budgets for Approval</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Due to financial difficulties, the central government decided to adopt an austerity policy, reduce military spending, and streamline redundant agencies to overcome this difficult situation.

<h3>Huang Hanliang Expected to Withdraw Resignation</h3>
<p>Finance Has Considerable Measures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Hanliang's resignation was retained by the Executive Yuan. Because the Shanghai banking community has expressed its willingness to maintain central government finances, his intention to resign is likely to be withdrawn. Zhang Enhong, the chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance, will return to Nanjing from Shanghai to work at the ministry. (Special telegram on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Jia'ao telegraphed to Ping that the government's finances have considerable measures, and the banking syndicate is willing to continue to help.

<h3>Various Divisions and Brigades Demand Pay from the Ministry of Military Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, all the staff members of various divisions and brigades stationed in Beijing went to the Ministry of Military Affairs to demand pay.

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Russo-Japanese Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>The Russian side hopes to conclude it soon.</p>
<p>Japan submits it to cabinet consideration.</p>
<p>National Seventeenth, Moscow Telegram: Russian government officials stated today that if the discussion of a Russo-Japanese military non-aggression treaty can be realized, it will prevent attempts by certain parties to instigate a Russo-Japanese war. According to reports from Tokyo, the Japanese government, after a cabinet meeting on Thursday, believes that there is no need to negotiate this treaty at present. However, general opinion here believes that Japan will eventually accept the Soviet proposal, but only after Japan has consolidated its position in Manchuria and Mongolia, because neither Japan nor the Soviet Union intends to engage in warfare. Political circles here are paying close attention to the treaty discussion and are eagerly awaiting the Japanese government's official reply.</p>
<p>Reuters Eighteenth, Tokyo Telegram: It is expected that today's cabinet meeting will consider the Russian proposal for Russia and Japan to conclude a non-aggression treaty. According to reliable sources, even if Russia is sincere, it was a major mistake for Russia to publicly announce this proposal before the Japanese government had time to consider it. Now, regardless of whether the government approves of this proposal or not, voices of opposition are widespread, so the possibility of accepting this proposal is almost eliminated. The sincerity of the Russian authorities is also doubtful. They should have known long ago what kind of backlash this matter would cause if not handled carefully. It is reported that the proposal for a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty was made by the Russian Foreign Minister to Fang Ze when he returned to take up the post of Foreign Minister after leaving Moscow. After this matter was made public, Japanese officials stated that Japan had never concluded such a treaty with any country, nor did it have any intention of invading Soviet territory.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides to Dissolve Parliament</h3>
<p>General Result: Government Victory Manipulation</p>
<p>Japanese United Eighteenth, Tokyo Telegram: Today's regular cabinet meeting decided that the 60th parliament will be dissolved immediately upon reopening. It also decided on the outline of the Prime Minister's policy speech and then adjourned. Currently, both ruling and opposition parties are planning strategies to deal with the election. The Seiyukai party is confident that it will win an absolute majority, predicting that it will gain 86 seats nationwide, for a total of 257 seats. On the Minseito party side, due to the secession of the Adachi faction, there are now only 246 seats. If neutral members of the Minseito party are added, there are 250 seats.</p>

<h3>Important League of Nations Proposals</h3>
<p>National Seventeenth, Geneva Telegram: The 66th session of the League of Nations Council will open here in a week. It was originally hoped that a preliminary report from a commission of inquiry regarding the Liaoning case could be obtained during the session, but the commission has not yet departed, and this hope has faded. However, there are still many important proposals at this session. The most important is the final preparations for the World Disarmament Conference, followed by the report of the European Economic Union Committee. The report will include important issues, such as recognizing the coexistence of the industrial capital system and the Soviet system, such as the final shelving of the Soviet proposal for an international economic non-aggression pact, such as the Belgian proposal to build a European international hydroelectric system, such as the unemployment problem, and such as the progress of building an international agricultural loan bank, all of which will be listed. Furthermore, there is the Iraqi independence case recommended by the Mandates Commission, which is also hoped to be passed at this Council session so that the British mandate over Iraq can be revoked at the September plenary session, recognizing it as a free and independent country, and joining the League of Nations as a member. At the same time, the joint British and French proposal for the demarcation of the border between Iraq and Syria is expected to proceed rapidly this time.</p>
<h3>International Disarmament Conference Plans to Establish a Permanent Administrative Body</h3>
<p>Regulations stipulate that the sovereignty of all countries must not be infringed upon.</p>
<p>National Seventeenth, Geneva Telegram: The establishment of a permanent disarmament committee, announced here today, will be one of the main tasks of this World Disarmament Conference. The League of Nations hopes that this committee can solve the administrative problems that are a major obstacle to the future of disarmament today. The attitude of the United States still maintains that the implementation of the International Disarmament Convention should only rely on the good faith of the countries concerned, but this view is not favored by Europe and other countries. They insist that unless the International Disarmament Convention has some kind of international administration for implementation, its value will not be worth a scrap of paper. However, if the signatories of the convention are limited to League of Nations member states, then this administrative power can easily be given to the League of Nations. However, many non-member states are participating today, such as the United States, Soviet Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and Afghanistan, who will never agree to entrust administrative power to the League of Nations. Therefore, the Disarmament Preparatory Committee had to seek another plan. However, the member states of the League of Nations have different opinions on this and believe that this administrative power, in any case, must not infringe upon the sovereignty of all countries, and it is also questionable whether countries will allow personnel from their administrative agencies to enter the country to investigate whether they have violated the Disarmament Convention. Therefore, the Disarmament Preparatory Committee adopted a compromise solution and stipulated in the draft convention the establishment of a permanent disarmament committee, whose nature is roughly similar to that of the Permanent Opium Committee. Although members are nominated by the governments of various countries, they are not representatives of the governments, nor may they visit the governments of various countries to inspect their armaments, and in no case shall they infringe upon the complete sovereignty of any country. Its authority can only review the annual armament reports made by each signatory country and has the right to obtain reports from other sources and consider them. If the committee believes that a signatory country has failed to fulfill the convention and has expanded its armaments beyond the legal limit, it has the right to request the League of Nations Council to pay attention to it. In addition, the committee will continue to prepare the basis for further reductions in armaments, to be decided at future disarmament conferences held every five or ten years. The committee shall submit a report at least once a year, reporting on the status of each signatory country's implementation of the armament treaty. Its first meeting will be held within three months after the implementation of the disarmament convention, and thereafter a regular meeting shall be held at least once a year. However, special meetings may be convened at any time at the request of the signatory country or in the event of a violation of the disarmament convention.</p>

<h3>Waters in Teapot River Basin Have Not Receded</h3>
<p>Disaster Area Exceeds Two Hundred Square Miles</p>
<p>Severe Damage to Agricultural Products</p>
<p>Reuters Eighteenth, Glendora Telegram: The flood area in the Mississippi River has been spared deaths due to the efforts of rescuers, but the waters of the river and its tributaries are still rising, and the suffering has increased. Today, it was learned here that 2,000 residents are currently trapped in a dangerous situation in the upper part of the Teapot River basin. The disaster area exceeds 200 square miles, covering six counties. Housing and agricultural products have been severely damaged. It is reported that the Mississippi River flooded in early April 1927, lasting six weeks, flooding 20,000 miles, drowning 200 people, and causing material losses worth 270 million yuan.

<h3>Drunkard Lying on Tracks Causes Major Disaster</h3>
<p>Moscow Train Cannot Withstand Second Impact</p>
<p>Two Hundred Passengers Tragically Killed in the Dark</p>
<p>Paris Train Derails, Injuring People</p>
<p>Reuters Eighteenth, Moscow Telegram: A terrible accident involving a train near Moscow on the 2nd of this month, causing 200 casualties, was only announced in detail today, causing great shock among those who heard it. It is rumored that the person indirectly responsible was a drunkard who, after drinking too much wine, came up with a novel method of suicide, throwing himself onto the tracks to be crushed by the wheels. At that time, a train full of workers from Kosygin to near Moscow was speeding along. The driver saw someone lying on the tracks and quickly stopped the train. Unexpectedly, in an instant, a second train followed closely behind and collided with the front train in the dark, causing the front train to derail, overturning the vehicles, and the passengers wailing. At this time, another locomotive came from the opposite direction and impacted the two trains that had already caused the accident, and the passengers of the previous two trains who had been lucky enough to escape were again subjected to the disaster. The fourth train arrived shortly afterwards, fortunately stopping in time and not causing further disasters. At that time, it was dark and rescue was difficult. The more seriously injured were rushed to the hospital. As a result, 68 people died and 130 were injured. Officials have arrested 11 people involved.</p>

<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Telegram to all newspaper offices, for the attention of the national public: Since the Shanxi Party Committee shot and killed students, resulting in the January 21st massacre, more than a month has passed, and no action has been seen. This is not enough to comfort the ambitions of the dead and injured, or stimulate patriotic enthusiasm. Recently, the People's Court of the Massacre Relief Association has been established, gathering public opinion to make just and fair claims. This is truly the first voice of democratic politics and a new opportunity for judicial progress. This association respectfully reads Xian's telegram and expresses utmost admiration. In addition to issuing a separate declaration, expressing full support, we hope that all compatriots across the country will unanimously advocate for this cause. Shanxi Provincial Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, seven chop marks.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Telegram to all newspaper offices: Recently, reports have stated that Zhejiang Province has intercepted central tax revenues, which is inconsistent with the facts. After investigation, it was found that Zhejiang Province, due to financial difficulties, had telegraphed the central government, requesting that the overdue subsidies and advances be reimbursed. The salt surtax and tobacco and alcohol license tax, which should belong to the province, were also requested to be allocated nearby according to the case. This is a normal procedure and does not involve intercepting national taxes. Fearing that the rumors are inaccurate, a special telegram is sent to clarify. Zhejiang Provincial Government, skillful, important news.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Eye Jehol from Three Directions</h3>
<p>Southern Route Already Advanced to Xinqiu</p>
<p>Utilizing Mongolian Bandits as Internal Support</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: After the Japanese army captured Jinzhou, the three northeastern provinces were completely under their control. Their ambition still lies in seizing Jehol, to realize their plan of annexing Manchuria and Mongolia. Before the fall of Jinzhou, the Beining Railway operated as usual. We were able to obtain news of the Japanese army's actions outside the customs through the railway. But after Jinzhou was captured, the Beining Railway only ran to Shanhaiguan. All telegrams and telephone lines outside the customs were cut off by the Japanese army, and news was blocked. Therefore, it was impossible to know the details of the Japanese army's military actions to attack Jehol, and the public also paid less attention. In fact, Jehol Province is the northern barrier of the Central Plains. If Jehol falls into Japanese hands, Peiping will be under greater threat, and the Japanese can cross the Great Wall and invade the interior of our country. After the fall of Jinzhou, one wing of the Japanese army extended westward to Suizhong, while the other wing advanced along the Chaoyang-Jinzhou line to attack Jehol. Our army retreated along the Beining Railway. Most of the troops were transferred to Luan County inside the customs for defense. The remaining troops, such as Zhang Shusen's cavalry brigade and the Volunteer Army, mostly moved to the Yixian-Chaoyang area on the border of Liaoning and Jehol, numbering about ten thousand. The Japanese army initially planned to take advantage of the situation, but was intercepted by our Volunteer Army and suffered heavy losses. This happened in the first ten days of this month. The Japanese army found this route mountainous, unfamiliar with the terrain, and the Volunteer Army appeared and disappeared unpredictably, making it difficult to succeed. Therefore, they changed their plan and decided to enter the interior from the plains in eastern Jehol, advancing along the north, south, and central routes. The southern route went from Heishan through Xinlitun to Fuxin, the central route went from Zhangwu along the main road to Suibei, and the northern route went from Tongliao along the main road to Kailu. A large number of troops were transferred from Shenyang to support the three routes, increasing their strength. Our side had only ten thousand Volunteer Army troops on the Datong branch line and three thousand troops in Tongliao. The enemy used infantry, cavalry, and artillery to launch fierce attacks on us. After the Volunteer Army fought desperately to resist, fierce battles occurred on the 11th and 12th. Both sides suffered casualties. Because the Japanese army had tanks, aircraft, heavy artillery and other powerful weapons, our army could not hold out on the 13th and retreated. Emergency signals were received from both Kailu and Fuxin. On the central route, the Japanese army could not advance because our army had destroyed several sections of the railway in Zhangwu. On the Chaoyang-Jinzhou line, the Japanese Shi division simultaneously launched a full-scale attack on Yixian. Our cavalry Third Brigade and part of the Nineteenth Brigade, together with the Volunteer Army, fought hard all day, but were unable to resist and had to retreat to Chaoyang. Yesterday, it was reported that the Japanese army on the southern route had already advanced to Xinqiu. The Murai Brigade is the main force on this route. The northern and central routes have been heavily attacked by the Volunteer Army on the Datong line and in Jinxi. Suffering significant damage, they seem to have adopted a slower advance and plan to use Mongolian bandits as internal support. (January 16)</p>
<p>Xi Qia Sends Troops to Attack Bin County Provincial Government</p>
<p>Yu Shenzhen Leads 6,000 Bandit Troops</p>
<p>Defeated by Zhang's Brigade in Yushu</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Bin County Provincial Government</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Jilin Provisional Provincial Government in Bin County had scheduled a meeting of representatives from all counties in the province on the 10th of this month. This was intended as an opportunity for the Provisional Provincial Government to gauge public sentiment and to reassure the people. The notification for each county to elect representatives specified that each county's agricultural, commercial, industrial, educational groups, and gentry should jointly elect five representatives to register three days before the meeting. By the 6th of this month, representatives from 25 counties had registered, and representatives from another 10 counties were on their way. Jilin Province has a total of 42 counties. No representatives were sent from only five or six counties. Xi Qia, the puppet governor of Jilin, was alarmed by this news, believing that the Binzhou Provincial Government's move would greatly harm his power. He decided to sabotage the meeting to prevent it from being convened. At the same time, Yu Shenzhen, newly appointed by Xi as the bandit suppression commander, formerly served as the commander of the 16th Division of the Jilin Army. Nicknamed "Big Head," Yu was an important figure among the northeastern warlords during Zhang Zuolin's era. Zhang Zuoxiang and Yu had a poor relationship, so Yu resigned in anger. This time, Yu took the position of puppet bandit suppression commander, intending to vent his anger. He took the opportunity to volunteer to Xi to lead troops to attack Bin County and eliminate the forces of the Jilin and Zhang families. The Japanese army also did not want the existence of the Bin County Provincial Government and strongly supported Xi Qia's move. In addition to providing as much military aid as possible, they also allocated 300 soldiers from the Hasegawa Brigade stationed in Jilin, changed them into Chinese military uniforms, and had them manage the artillery. On the 6th, Yu Shenzhen led Liu Baolin's 3,000 troops from the 1st Police Brigade and 3,000 newly recruited bandits under Gong Shazi, claiming to suppress bandits. They passed through Shulan County, planning to attack Yushu and Acheng to attack Binzhou. The army traveled secretly. On the 8th, they arrived in Yushu County, where Zhang Zuozhou's 3,000 troops from the 25th Brigade of the Jilin Army were stationed. Upon hearing that Yu Shenzhen had led bandits to the area, Brigade Commander Zhang Zuozhou immediately led his troops to attack outside Yushu City. A fierce battle broke out at Xiushuidianzi, 35 li south of Yushu City, at 8 PM on the 8th. The fighting continued until late at night. 300 police and 500 militiamen from Yushu County also rushed to assist, attacking the rebel army from both sides. Part of Gong Shazi's bandit army also repented and defected, turning their weapons and attacking the rebel army. By 2 AM on the 9th, the rebel army could not hold out and suffered a major defeat, retreating in panic to Shulan County. After repelling the rebel army, the 25th Brigade, the militia, and the police were assigned to defend the area. The 25th Brigade was stationed in villages outside the city, while the militia and the police were responsible for defending the city, with the county magistrate serving as the martial law commander in charge of the city's defense. At noon on the 9th, Ding Chao of the Railway Protection Army in Harbin, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched the 653rd Regiment of Xing Zhanqing's 26th Brigade to Yushu to assist in the attack on the rebel army. It was reported that they arrived in Yushu on the evening of the 10th. There was still fighting in the area that night. The outcome is not yet known. In addition to sending one regiment to Yushu, the 26th Brigade's other regiment stationed in Yimianpo was ordered to move to Wuchang County today to prevent the rebel army from flanking them from that direction. The guard regiment of Feng Zhanhai's troops, which were garrisoned in Bin County to protect the provincial government, moved to Acheng yesterday to set up defenses. The Bin County Provincial Government has ordered the militias of Binjiang, Shuangcheng, Acheng, Wuchang, Zhuhe, and Weihe counties to implement a joint defense, regardless of county boundaries, to jointly suppress any rebel army passing through the area. The conference of representatives from all counties still opened as scheduled on the 10th. However, at noon yesterday, a Japanese plane flew to Bin County and flew very low over the city. It circled for about ten minutes and dropped six bombs on the provincial government building, destroying three provincial government buildings. Several civilian houses and shops were affected, and more than 20 pedestrians and provincial government employees were injured. The streets were thrown into chaos. The conference of representatives from all counties being held in the provincial government was also suspended. Currently, the Jilin troops, except for Li Guilin's 23rd Brigade and Ji Xing's 24th Brigade, which are under the command of Xi Qia, and the 1st and 2nd Police Brigades newly recruited by Xi Qia, the remaining troops that listen to the dispatch of the Bin County Provincial Government include Ding Chao's 28th Brigade, Xing Zhanqing's 26th Brigade, Li Du's 29th Brigade, Su Dechen's 22nd Brigade, Zhao Zhixiang's 21st Brigade, and Feng Zhanhai's guard regiment. Their strength is superior to that of Xi Qia. However, since yesterday, many troops from the Japanese Hasegawa Brigade have been moving from Liaoxi and Changchun to Jilin. The Japanese have gained an advantage in the Jinxi battle. It is feared that they will transfer some of their forces to assist Xi Qia in expelling the Bin County Provincial Government. This is a cause for concern. (January 11)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Hinders Huludao Port Construction</h3>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" Tianjin dispatch on the 16th reports that the Japanese army that occupied Huludao on the 4th withdrew on the 13th. However, Japanese warships are still anchored there, completely preventing the progress of the port construction project. The reason China is developing Huludao is to compete with Dalian. Therefore, the construction of the port is also one of the reasons for the Japanese military action. Dr. Jay, an employee of the Dutch Harbor Company, arrived in Tianjin today after five days of trekking to seek food and other supplies for the more than sixty Western men, women, and children isolated in Huludao. According to reports, the situation on the island is serious. He plans to return to the island tonight and hopes to persuade the Japanese to provide transportation convenience from Shanhaiguan to the island. According to Dr. Jay, the Chinese troops stationed in Huludao withdrew on their own when the Japanese army was about to arrive. They removed the important parts of the radio station and took away two cannons. Therefore, there was no conflict when the Japanese army arrived on the island. There are still about 300 Chinese workers on the island, but the port construction funds stored in the Shenyang Bank were seized by the Japanese army, resulting in no funds to pay for labor. Furthermore, news was received here today that the Japanese have appointed a person to be in charge of the section of the Beining Railway outside Shanhaiguan in Shenyang and have completely seized the management of that section. They have ordered that all station revenue be remitted to Shenyang. Any railway staff who communicate with the Tianjin Administration will be dismissed and investigated. They have also threatened to make the section of the railway outside Shanhaiguan part of the South Manchuria Railway. There will be no more through trains between Tianjin and Shenyang. Therefore, the British ambassador to China and the ambassador to Japan have separately lodged strong protests with Japan. However, according to private news, the Japanese have agreed to compensate the British for all losses suffered after the Japanese occupation.</p>
<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 18th, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week for Sun Yat-sen. More than 600 people attended, including Chen Guofu, Feng Yuxiang, Li Ciwen, Hong Ludong, Zheng Zhannan, Xiao Zhongzhen, Li Zonghuang, Wang Qi, Huang Shao Gu, Gan Naiguang, Xie Zuomin, etc. Chen Guofu presided over the meeting. After paying respects, Feng Yuxiang and Chen Guofu gave reports. Feng's report briefly stated that the most important thing was the situation of foreign aggression. In recent days, the Japanese army has been attacking Jehol from three directions. When the Japanese army advanced, battles broke out between Xinmin and Shanhaiguan. The local militia and volunteer army in the Dagushan-Goubangzi-Jinzhou area resisted the Japanese. Of course, the equipment, training, and organization of the volunteer army are not as good as the Japanese army, but their spirit of risking their lives is much stronger than that of the Japanese. They charged forward and cut off and besieged the Japanese army. The Japanese army also knelt on the ground and begged for mercy. In short, the unprecedented disaster we have faced for thousands of years can only be addressed by comrades working together with one heart and one mind and with a planned approach to ensure the survival of the Chinese nation. Otherwise, the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction is imminent. Regarding our internal situation, the recent meetings of the Special Committee of the Central Political Committee have been very spirited. Everyone is very happy because they believe that when the country is facing a major crisis, it is impossible to save the crisis without very brave, very resolute, very detailed research and discussion. The spirit of this meeting should be like this. The Special Committee discussed two major issues: (1) diplomacy, (2) finance, and has conducted in-depth research and detailed discussions. Secondly, Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang have met and will come to Nanjing soon. Mr. Hu can also come. We know that the power of separation is very small, and the power of unity is very great. Now that everyone is united like this, it is very important to the future of the party and the country.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Another thing to report is the situation in the countryside. The suffering of the villagers is immense. Droughts, floods, and insect plagues have left them with no harvest. What we hear there every day is poverty and sickness. Because of this, they become sick from poverty and die from sickness. Many villages in the north are broken. The suffering of the people in the Yangtze River area due to last year's floods is no different. Since the people are suffering so much, but politics has not been fully improved, the county magistrates in various places are very chaotic. I hope that the comrades of our party will do their best to correct this and hope that the Control Yuan will be swift and decisive in rewarding the good and punishing the bad. The last thing to say is that when the country is facing a major crisis, I hope that the comrades of our party will come together to look at the enemies of the country and not just look at the mistakes of their own brothers. I hope that the comrades can sincerely unite from now on to save this extremely dangerous motherland and save these poor and helpless compatriots, which is also saving themselves.</p>
<p>On the same morning, the National Government held a memorial week for Sun Yat-sen. More than 300 people attended, including Lin Sen, Sun Ke, Chen Mingshu, Zhu Peide, Chen Shaokuan, Ru Yuli, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, Wu Tiecheng, etc. Lin Sen presided over the meeting. After paying respects, Sun Ke reported on the finances and diplomacy of the new government since its establishment, briefly stating that the unified government has been established for more than half a month. Many difficulties have been felt in politics, and problems that are not easy to solve at one time are one is finance, and one is diplomacy. Financial difficulties did not start today, but the current difficulties are more serious, because the current military and political expenses are estimated to be 22 million yuan per month. The Treasury's revenue is only 6-7 million yuan per month, and there is a monthly shortfall of 15-16 million yuan. In order to make up for this, the government has to implement austerity policies and reduce military and political expenses to the lowest level to overcome this difficulty. Based on this idea, the Central Special Committee has made the following resolutions: (1) Reduce military and political expenses. Military expenses will be reduced to 16 million per month, and political expenses will be reduced from 4 million to 2 million per month, for a total reduction of 4 million. A monthly shortfall of more than 18 million will still exist. It is hoped that the financial authorities will do their best to raise funds. (2) It was resolved that all central government agencies will, starting this month, reduce their monthly expenses by 50% in the next six months, and at the same time abolish redundant agencies to save waste. However, there are two types of political expenses that cannot be reduced. The Special Committee has resolved that they are special circumstances and are not subject to reduction, namely diplomatic expenses and educational expenses. This is the central government's current palliative approach to financial problems, and the fundamental solution is still difficult to determine. As for diplomatic issues, the League of Nations Council is scheduled to meet on the 25th of this month. In order to reiterate our previous request, the Central Government will certainly proceed with the proposal. The government has already sent Ambassador Yan to the United States to attend the meeting and is prepared to propose the provisions of Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to request member states to uphold justice and use economic power to sanction Japan's outrageous actions. Secondly, the United States recently sent notes to the Chinese and Japanese governments stating that it did not recognize the de facto situation in the three northeastern provinces caused by military action, and the treaties or agreements caused by this incident that infringe on American rights in the three northeastern provinces. This note should be accepted by our country, but it is hoped that the United States can fully apply the Pact of Paris and promote its effectiveness. At the same time, it is hoped that the United States can maintain peace in East Asia and the world based on the Nine-Power Treaty. Furthermore, it is hoped that the United States can convene a second Washington Conference when necessary to resolve the issue of the three northeastern provinces. In addition, some advocate direct negotiations with Japan. Japan's military actions in the three northeastern provinces have not stopped for a single day, so there is absolutely no possibility of direct negotiations. Moreover, Japan has put forward so-called five principles in the League of Nations, which is even more ridiculous. Our country will never accept it. If Japan wants to negotiate with us, it must first stop all its military actions in the eastern provinces and withdraw the five principles before negotiations can proceed. As for the issue of severing diplomatic relations with Japan, it has been discussed by the Central Government many times and was originally a relatively active expression, but because the matter is of great importance, it has not been possible to make a decision rashly. The above-mentioned two difficult problems, the final solution, still needs to be decided by the Central Government. Now that Wang, Chiang, and Hu have not come, so it must be decided after they come. In recent days, there has been some relatively good news, that is, Chiang and Wang have met and talked in Hangzhou and promised to jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country. When Mr. Hu comes north, they will then enter Nanjing together. The Central Government has sent Yu Youren to Hong Kong to urge him to come north immediately and to implement the sincere unity of the top leaders to resolve the country's serious national crisis. It is believed that this will open up a new path to turn the country from danger to safety. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Divided into Four Pacification Zones</h3>
<p>Troop Defense Areas Re-Allocated</p>
<p>Organizational Structure of the Pacification Headquarters</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong military authorities recently resolved to divide the entire province into four pacification zones: East, South, Northwest, and Central, to consolidate security and eliminate bandits. After several military conferences by the First Army Group, the zoning plan has been revised. The geographical scope of each zone is as follows: The Central Zone governs the counties under the jurisdiction of Guangzhou Prefecture and Si Ping and Kaiping; the Eastern Zone governs the three prefectures of Chaozhou and Meizhou; the Northwestern Zone governs the prefectures of Zhaoqing, Yangjiang, Luo Ding, Nanhua, Shaozhou, Lianxian, and other counties; the Former Zone governs the four prefectures of Gaozhou, Leizhou, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou. The Second Army under Xiang Hanping's command has been internally designated to garrison the Central Zone. The Third Army under Ji Yangjing's command will garrison the Eastern Zone. The First Army under Yu Hanmou's command will garrison the Northwestern Zone.

<h3>Fuzhou Press Strives for Freedom</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Agrees to Abolish Censorship</p>
<p>"Oriental Daily" Resumes Publication</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Japanese Consulate filed a protest because the "New Tide" and "Oriental" newspapers in Minyuan published a telegram and commentary about the assassination of the Japanese Emperor. The provincial government immediately ordered the two newspapers to stop publishing and detained Wu Changming, the president of the "New Tide" newspaper. At the same time, it ordered the Martial Law Command to send personnel to various newspaper offices every day to review manuscripts and ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to order various newspaper offices to re-register within five days before they are allowed to publish. The newspaper offices believed that this was flattering the enemy and oppressing public opinion and unanimously expressed their opposition. Starting on the 10th, they convened meetings for days and elected representatives to go to the provincial government to negotiate, demanding the restoration of the publication of the "New Tide" and "Oriental" newspapers, the release of Wu Changming, the abolition of censorship and registration, and expressed that if the authorities forced censorship and registration, they would all stop publishing, issue a declaration, and request assistance from all walks of life. The two sides have been deadlocked for several days, and there is still no solution. For a time, the situation between the government and the press was quite serious. On the 13th, Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of the provincial government, returned from Shanghai. The newspapers re-elected representatives to meet with him and restate their previous request. As a result of consultations, Fang agreed to abolish censorship, exempted those who had registered from re-registration, restored the publication of the "Oriental Daily," and released Wu Changming. The case was thus resolved. However, after this setback, the anti-Japanese rhetoric of the Fuzhou press has gradually declined. With the dissolution of the Anti-Japanese Association, the tearing down of anti-Japanese slogans, and the anti-Japanese atmosphere has completely disappeared. (January 15)</p>
<h3>Fang Ze's Manchuria-Mongolia Talk</h3>
<p>Stating that the New Nation Should Revert to Tokyo</p>
<p>France's Question Will Be Answered Later</p>
<p>Antung Dispatch: Japanese Minister to France, Mr. Fang Ze, was promoted to Foreign Minister due to the Inukai Cabinet's formation. He returned to Japan from Paris, passing through Siberia, Shenyang, and then traveling east along the Anfeng Line. On the 11th at 9 PM, he arrived in Antung. The Japanese residents there, as usual, welcomed him at the station. Mr. Fang Ze made a brief speech in the VIP room, stating, "Since my departure from Paris, all negotiations have been temporarily suspended, so there are no facts to announce. As for the construction of the new nation in Manchuria-Mongolia, in my opinion, it must revert to the orders of Tokyo. The irreverent incident in Tokyo caused the cabinet to resign en masse. I received a report upon arriving in Harbin, and also heard that France requested a clear answer from Japan regarding Japan's intentions in Manchuria. Because the cabinet is preparing to resign en masse, this matter may have to be postponed. The League of Nations Council meeting on the 25th of this month is the most difficult problem. China's anti-propaganda within the League of Nations Council is very difficult to deal with. The representatives of various countries do not understand Manchuria-Mongolia, just as we do not understand Europe. The last two Council meetings were the most difficult, and the situation gradually improved after the third meeting. The Chinese representative, Mr. Shi, and I both strived to compete. Furthermore, there are quite a few Kuomintang members from Paris, who constantly coerced Mr. Shi, which is regrettable. If the League of Nations had not intervened this time, China and Japan would have already been formally at war. In short, this conference at the League of Nations was purely a debate for the world." After Mr. Fang Ze finished speaking, he boarded the train and headed east. (January 12th)</p>

<p>Mediation of the Soochow University Student Strike Ineffective: Due to the school authorities' insistence, the situation has deteriorated. Mediation has failed. The students have sent three representatives to the Ministry of Education to petition. At the same time, many students have returned to the school. Because there is no one in charge at the school, everything is maintained by themselves. Magistrate Zhang Yiyun was present when the incident occurred and is well aware of the truth of this strike.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Re-Trial of Fraud Case by the District Court: Cao Yuanmo, the director of the Relief Institute, and Jiang Hong, the director and fundraising committee member of the former institute, handled the fundraising. After investigation, it was found that the donation book listed a total of 2,148 yuan. In addition to the amount already paid, 2,000 yuan was still owed by Ji Yuqing. Because the institute was running out of funds, it specially sent a letter to the county magistrate asking Jiang Hong to pay Ji's donation. The county government asked Ji Sha, the wife of Ji Yuqing, to sue for fraud, claiming that the donation was not voluntary. After the county court ruled in favor of Ji Sha, Jiang Hong appealed to the district court, which ruled that Jiang Hong should return 1,000 yuan in cash, 3,000 yuan in public notes, and ten Chengfeng Zhuang promissory notes (1,000 yuan) to Ji Sha. Jiang still refused to accept the ruling and appealed to the high court. The high court has ruled that the case be remanded to the district court for a retrial. As the case remains unresolved, it is now questioned whether the remaining 1,000 yuan in cash can be allocated to the Relief Institute for use, and Jiang Hong has been asked to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Two Robberies and Injuries in One Day: As winter defense is approaching, robbery cases have been occurring frequently in the countryside. Two more cases occurred on the same day last night, as described below: ㈠ In Ni Lane, Xin'an Township, 13th District, the farmer Ni Genquan, who had some land, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits with weapons at about 5:00 PM last night. At that time, the farmers and workers were still working and had not dispersed. Because they were unarmed, they did not dare to resist and were driven into the shed. The bandits searched everywhere. Ni's mother, who was in her fifties, was burned in her lower body by the bandits because she refused to reveal the location of the hidden money. Genquan had not been married for long, and all the gold and silver jewelry and clothes were robbed. After checking, it was found that more than thirty pieces of the newlywed's clothes, six quilts, one gold bracelet, two gold rings, and cash were all looted. ㈡ The house of Wang Zhangbao, a resident of Miaotou Township in the same district, was suddenly attacked by more than twenty bandits after 9:00 PM on the same day. Two bandits claimed to have pistols, and the rest had iron rulers and wooden sticks. More than two hundred yuan in cash and soft clothes were looted. Zhangbao's wife, seeing that everything in the room was gone, was heartbroken and stepped forward to snatch it from the bandits. She was stabbed seven times and bled profusely, falling to the ground unconscious. The bandits then fled with the stolen goods. In addition to sending the injured to the city for treatment, both cases have been reported to the county for investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Hostage Was Killed, Bandit Leader Arrested: According to news from the transportation sector yesterday, Zhang Ziquan, a resident of Xiafuqiao, Zhangzhu Town, Yixing, who had some land, went to Chen Laogong's tenant house in Xiyangzhu last November to collect rent, and was suddenly kidnapped by bandits. The Zhang family was very anxious after receiving the news and repeatedly planned to raise money for the ransom, but there was no news and no way to contact them. Recently, Zhang's son, a certain Jia, suddenly received a letter from the bandits demanding a large ransom. Coincidentally, Guan Laosi, a fellow villager who was familiar with the inside story of the bandits, went to Zhang's house and claimed to be able to redeem the hostage. Zhang's son was overjoyed when he heard this, and gave 3,600 yuan in cash to Guan Laosi, along with the shop assistants Zhou Da and Ding Zhaofu, to go to the bandit den to redeem the hostage. However, as soon as Guan Laosi arrived at the bandit den, he contacted the bandits and paid them 1,900 yuan in cash. The rest of the cash was pocketed by Guan Laosi. The bandits, dissatisfied with the amount, threatened Zhou Da and Ding Zhaofu with guns. Zhou and Ding, fearing for their safety, had to return home and report to the Zhang family. Until recently, Zhang's son received another letter from the bandits, saying that the previous letter had specified a ransom of 3,600 yuan, but only 1,900 yuan was received when the hostage was to be redeemed. Now your father, Zhang Ziquan, has been killed, and his body has been discarded in Tiger Cave, etc. After reading the letter, the Zhang family cried bitterly. On the 14th of this month, they sent the shop assistants Zhou Da and Ding Zhaofu to the mountains to search for the body. On the way through Huangzhu Village, they went to a tea shop for a drink. As soon as they sat down, the bandit leader Xu Tingxian and one of his accomplices also entered the shop for tea. They talked about the process of killing the hostage, saying that Zhang Ziquan's body was now at the bottom of Houqiao and had already rotted. After speaking, the two bandits left the tea shop. Zhou and Ding immediately reported to the town's business group and asked them to send a team to arrest them. After receiving the report, Head Wang immediately dispatched armed group members with guns and live ammunition, and led Guan Laosi, who knew the inside story of the bandits, to Yangzigang, where they captured the bandit leader Xu Tingxian and seized two large knives. They took him to the group headquarters for further interrogation. Xu confessed that the hostage Zhang Ziquan had been killed and dismembered into three sections last month and thrown into the lotus pond. After receiving the confession, Head Wang dispatched group members to the lotus pond on the 15th to search for the body. When they arrived at the destination and started searching, they found a body. The Zhang family identified that it was not Ziquan's body and ordered the Zheng to prepare a coffin for burial. It is said that the corpse was surnamed Zhou and was from Shandong. He had also been involved with the bandits during his lifetime.</p>

<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Strike: No less than 2,000 rickshaw pullers in Huaiyin went on strike today (14th) because the Public Security Bureau planned to increase the donation of each rickshaw by 2 jiao per month from January of this year, in addition to the original donation of 4 jiao. The rickshaw pullers felt that business has been very slow in recent years due to the severe famine and that they could not afford the increase. So, they agreed to strike together, stop operating, and gather at the South City Park to participate in the anti-Japanese movement and discuss countermeasures. The majority opposed the increase in donations. After Tang Ying, a member of the standing committee of the labor union, persuaded them in various ways and promised to negotiate with the Public Security Bureau, they agreed to resume work tomorrow (15th), but they still did not recognize the increase in donations.</p>

<h3>Anhui Education Association Urges Payment of Arrears</h3>
<p>Since the 16th year of the Republic (1927), Anhui's education funds have been allocated from the tobacco tax, and there has never been a situation where several months of arrears have occurred. Since the central government took over the tobacco tax as a unified tax and stipulated that 100,000 yuan be allocated monthly to the province as an educational subsidy, it has also been able to pay the subsidy monthly. This semester, the central government has been in arrears with the province's subsidy for up to four months, which is unprecedented in recent years. It is heard that the teachers and staff in the province petitioned the provincial government once in November due to the excessive arrears. Now, four representatives have been sent on the 15th to go to Beijing to petition after the principals of each school, to work together, urge the payment of arrears, and seek to consolidate the future.</p>
<h3>Beijing Principals Welcome Director Xie</h3>
<p>Xie Weifu, the Director of the Education Bureau of Nanjing City, has arrived at the bureau to take office. The principals of the city's schools held a welcome meeting at the Central District Experimental School on the 16th, with Wang Zhixiang, the principal on duty, presiding over the meeting. Qing Song was publicly recommended to give a welcome speech. On the spot, 37 suggestions for improving Nanjing's education were put forward. Mr. Xie expressed his sincerity in accepting them and expressed his gratitude. In the evening, a banquet was held at the Wanquan Restaurant in Lishui Bridge to welcome Mr. Xie and bid farewell to former Director Zhang.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Middle School Students' Trip to Hong Kong Abolished</h3>
<p>After the representatives of students above middle school in Hangzhou petitioned in Beijing on the 7th, they decided to petition Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Hu Hanmin separately because they did not get a satisfactory result. They went to Shanghai on the 11th to meet Wang and ask him to go to Beijing with illness to face the national crisis. Wang did not agree to meet them due to illness, and only his secretary Peng Xuepei replied on his behalf, saying that he would go to Beijing as soon as he recovered. The group then sent representatives to Hangzhou to visit Chiang. Chiang lived in Cheng Lu in Hangzhou. The group went in a column and encountered many obstacles on the way. Not only did they not get to enter his residence, but they also refused to accept a petition. Disappointed, the group came to Shanghai again. They held a meeting at Shanghai Middle School last night and discussed the trip to Hong Kong for a long time. As a result, since Wang and Chiang could not meet them with sincerity, it was feared that the trip to Hong Kong and Hu Hanmin would also be fruitless. Moreover, the steamship passport that Deputy Dean Chen had promised to allocate was never issued despite repeated telegrams, so the trip to Hong Kong was canceled. The group was extremely saddened by the petitioning process.</p>

<h3>Two Telegrams from the Shanghai Education Community's National Salvation Federation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Community's National Salvation Federation issued a telegram: To all compatriots in the country: Recent reports have stated that the Northeast Volunteers have risen up to kill the enemy. Their chivalry and righteousness are shocking far and wide. The country supports 2 million soldiers, and the people of the whole country squeeze their lifeblood and endure suffering to provide for the enjoyment of the commanders. Once the enemy arrives, they retreat without fighting, allowing our great rivers and mountains to fall into the hands of foreigners. Anyone with a human heart cannot help but feel grief and indignation. The Volunteers, upholding the determination to save themselves and the country, bravely went to the front and were killed one after another. This not only puts the incompetent authorities to shame but also awakens the dying national soul. The survival of the Chinese nation depends on this. All of our citizens should rise up together and provide full assistance. Whether it is spiritual or material, we are willing to do our best at this time. If the country is destroyed and the family is ruined, what will be left for us? This telegram is hereby sent, hoping that you will understand. Respectfully, the Shanghai Education Community's National Salvation Federation.</p>
<p>Another telegram: To the National Government of Nanjing: Since the violent Japanese invaded Dongbei, the national army has retreated without fighting, and the people of the whole country are extremely saddened and indignant. We were hoping that the North-South peace talks would be completed, and a new government would be formed, fulfilling the declaration of attaching importance to the people's education and convening a national emergency conference as soon as possible so that the majority of the trained people under the party's rule would also have the opportunity to contribute their humble opinions. But as soon as the central government was established, Jinzhou fell. The so-called national defense force, which defends the country and the people, only knows how to suck the people's blood and enjoy themselves at will, and still retains the intention to preserve its strength in the face of disaster. The government has never heard a word of condemnation and has not seen any plans to defend against the enemy. Could it be that the gentlemen of the government really regard the public opinion of the people as nothing? Everyone in the world wants to survive, and if they are not insane, they would rather die together. The country is in such danger, and the people's anger is so great. Our government, which is entrusted with the lives of all the people, has the responsibility of saving the country and the people. Please concentrate the talents of the whole country and form a temporary national emergency conference as soon as possible to determine and implement the various internal and external policies, so that the country's life can be extended slightly. We telegraph this in tears, and our hearts are broken. We humbly ask for your consideration. Respectfully, the Shanghai Education Community's National Salvation Federation.</p>
<h3>Party Teacher Qualifications of a Small Number to Be Canceled</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Ideology Teacher Qualification Review Committee has reviewed and approved a total of 828 party ideology teachers from senior, junior, and elementary schools in six batches, all of whom were previously announced and issued certificates. This newspaper has recorded that the deadline for receiving the certificates was originally limited to January 9th of this year, the last batch deadline. However, in order to prevent rumors, the committee sent registered letters to each qualified person in mid-December of last year, asking them to come and collect the certificates by a certain date, otherwise the qualifications would be canceled according to regulations in order to end the matter as soon as possible. However, as of yesterday, there were still some people who had not collected their certificates, including Lei Bingzhen, Shen Yun, Ke Honghuan, Huang , Zhu Qieru, Chen Bi, Wang Puchen, Zhao Kang, Zhou Yixiu, Wu Xiangyun, Lao Jian, Guo Yongxi, Ye Changfeng, Ye Xiufu, Zhang Dafu, Qiu Guanzhun, Wang Xianxing, Peng Yongkang, Liang Bingru, Cui Xiaowu, Zhang Yinpu, Tong Pingshan, Gu Jin, Xiang Mengjia, etc., a total of 25 people. The committee will cancel their qualifications within a few days and will not be responsible for keeping their certificates and the original documents they submitted. As for the documents of those who are unqualified, if they have not been collected by now, they will be handled in the same way, because the committee has repeatedly stated this in advance.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Careless Talk</p>
<p>From Nanjing Road to Nanjing City (Continued)</p>
<p>I gradually connected "dead people blocking the road" to "sick people governing the country." The government is a machine. If a screw on the machine is rusty, it must be replaced immediately, otherwise the entire machine may collapse. Two of the standing committee members of the Central Political Conference are ill. If Mr. Wang resigned due to illness, it is an attitude that a politician should have. It is a huge mistake to be ill and not resign, forcing a sick person to take office. (Of course, not being sick, not taking office, and not resigning is also a kind of mistake.) Allowing this mistake to exist is a public mistake of the Chinese people. A few days ago, most of the National Government Committee members left the capital, causing more than 90 important official matters to pile up and remain unresolved, which was caused by the difference in thinking that forced sick people to be responsible. I waited on the Great Horse Road for more than an hour and finally recited a four-character poem: "Dead people blocking the road; sick people governing the country... The road is impassable, the country will not be a country?" I wrote this poem not to blame the past, but simply to hope that the people of the country will no longer allow "dead people to block the road" and no longer force "sick people to govern the country."</p>
<p>Welcoming the Triumphant Return of the Virgin Flight Conquering the Sky</p>
<p>Ms. Ye Hua's classmate, Sun Tixin, returned from the United States. He works for the Eurasia Aviation Company. On the 13th, he invited family members to Hongqiao Airport to welcome the company's No. 1 aircraft. It conquered the virgin skies north and south of the Tianshan Mountains and triumphantly returned to its hometown after pioneering air routes. At 4:30 p.m. that day, the aircraft soared in the sky and tumbled in space. Seeing us waving scarves and taking off our hats, it responded with three weeks of circling and a pilgrimage. It went up and down three times, with the fuselage almost touching the ground, and then returned to the blue sky. Its piloting skills were truly breathtaking. Sun said that the German pilot, Lutz, was not only highly skilled but also heroic in nature. No one but Lutz could risk flying west many times. The northwest border is especially dangerous, with many bandits and robbers. Last year, one of the company's aircraft flying to Manchouli was shot by bandits in Mongolia. The pilots, Patbje and Koelber, were seriously injured and fell into the desert. Lutz volunteered to go out and scout. He drove to the site where the pilots were killed. The bandits used the same trick again, and a bullet hit the trachea. Fortunately, he was not injured. He rushed to the high ground and flew to Manchouli to telegraph Russia for rescue. At that time, his trachea was damaged, and he only had two gallons of fuel left. He was lucky to escape. The success of Aircraft No. 1 today is a major indication of China's future. I have heard that a two-seater aircraft costs six or seven thousand gold. Ordinary ones cost ten thousand gold. Chiang Kai-shek's amphibious aircraft is worth more than one hundred thousand gold. The interior is arranged like a yacht, and it is unusually spacious. Aircraft No. 1 is worth more than 110,000 gold. It can carry a weight of 17,000 grams, equivalent to 25,500 pounds. Its speed is 120 kilometers per hour. On the morning of December 20th last year, it departed from Peiping at 7:00 a.m. and traveled through Guihua, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, and the Ruo Shui River. It arrived in Dihua, Xinjiang at 3:00 p.m. on the 22nd, breaking the Far East air record. Hu Shi once said, "People are flying in the sky, and we are crawling on the ground. It only takes 36 hours for people to get from Paris to Peiping. It takes us more than 100 hours to get from Gansu to Peiping." Now, thousands of miles away can be reached in more than 20 hours, which is enough to raise our eyebrows and breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The souvenirs brought back this time include a genuine camel wool carpet, which was hand-woven by the people of Xinjiang and has never been seen in the Central Plains. It is said that in the northwest where the ice cracks the ground, fishermen wear camel skin into the water to catch fish to avoid the cold. Leather goods and medicinal materials are cheap and of good quality. Silver ingots are used as currency, with taels as the unit. Seeing the Mexican silver dollar, everyone is surprised and regards it as a novelty. Alas, at this time of national crisis, China is being squeezed so much that it cannot be squeezed any further, and it cannot make peace. It can only fall into a long period of struggle and actively manage the northwest, striving to shorten the distance to the border. This is a necessary condition for the survival of the nation. The success of Aircraft No. 1 is not just the honor of one aircraft.</p>
<p>Barber, Tailor, and Official</p>
<p>Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Barbering is a small skill. However, if you don't learn it, you can't do it. If you force it, you will be skinned and bleed. Now, if you grab a passerby and hand him a knife and scissors, saying, "Please give me a shave," he will surely decline humbly, saying that he has never learned it. However, when it comes to being an official, everyone tries to do it, and everyone can do it. I have never heard of anyone declining. This shows that they regard being an official as no more difficult than shaving. Tailoring is also a small craft, but all the clothes in the world are made by it. Now, if you have a piece of wool or silk and want to make clothes, you would not entrust it to any of your children, nephews, in-laws, classmates, fellow villagers, benefactors, old friends, or people with strong recommendations. This is because they worry that the clothes will be ruined before they are made. However, when it comes to being an official, they only appoint the people mentioned above. This shows that they value being an official less than they value a piece of wool or silk. This shows that they regard being an official as no more difficult than tailoring.</p>
<p>Gleanings from the Art World</p>
<p>Yong Xi</p>
<p>The artistic traitor Liu Haisu recently hosted a banquet for Ms. Zhou Jun, the wife of Cai Yuanpei, and Hu Shi, Jiang Menglin, Ren Hongjun, Mr. and Mrs. Zhou Zijing, and Mr. and Mrs. Zhou Shujuan at Cun Tian Ge. Ge is Haisu's painting studio, which houses more than 200 of Haisu's works from his travels in Europe. Among them, the replica of "Dante and Virgil" is especially noteworthy. The giant painting is a masterpiece depicting Dante's Inferno. On the left, the person in green clothes and a red hat is Dante. To his right, the person in red clothes and a crown is Virgil. The two philosophers are sailing together in a small boat, while many of the guilty souls are surrounding and attacking them, convulsing and struggling in all kinds of pain. The painting depicts the dark and gloomy state of hell, which makes people shudder. There are many other masterpieces by Haisu in Rome, Paris, Venice, and Belgium. Mrs. Cai browsed through them one by one and lingered. Mrs. Cai is also an oil painting expert and has been studying it for a long time. Therefore, she is able to appreciate the paintings and has a special ear for music. On the left wall of Ge is Kang Youwei's inscription "Cun Tian Ge." The four corners contain calligraphy and paintings by Wu Changshuo, Liang Qichao, Tan Zu'an, and Chen Shizeng. These people were all old friends of Haisu and have now passed away. Haisu couldn't help but feel a sense of loss. After drinking to his heart's content, Mrs. Zhou, Menglin, and Shizhi drank three cups with Haisu. After the banquet, they went to Haisu's reading building to view his collection of ancient paintings and old rubbings. Menglin expressed his sympathy for the motto that Haisu had inscribed on his seat. The motto read: "Do what you believe in. If you are afraid of being attacked and do not do it, or if you do not do it because others do not help, you are not a hero who stands tall and treads firmly on the ground." Menglin further asked when Haisu had established this creed. Haisu replied that it was what he had encouraged himself with when he founded the Art Academy at the age of seventeen. Everyone present was deeply impressed.</p>
<p>A Casual Reading of Divination Gleanings</p>
<p>Zhang Chouxi</p>
<p>One night long ago, I visited a friend at the New World Hotel. I happened to miss him. Disappointed, I wanted to return home. I walked past a neighboring room and heard a loud noise that shook my eardrums. I stopped to watch. I caught sight of an old man with a spirited look on his face. He pointed with his fingers and spoke, telling fortunes and practicing the six ren. Driven by curiosity, I entered the room and watched from the sidelines. First, a certain former director of a certain road, who had been living in Shanghai for years, asked the six ren to divine whether his wish to seek a job would be fulfilled. The hexagram was "Wei Shi Zhi Chuan Mao Yin Chou." The diviner said, "Are you seeking a job on the railway? If so, you will surely see an order from the ministry within a reply." This is because Mao is used, and Mao is an official of boats and vehicles. Qinglong lives in Wu. From Li Xiansheng's tombstone in Xinghua,</p>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>Chen Tianying once responded to the invitation of Lin Gui Kuang Hui Feng to compile the "Tao Qi Collection of Stone Records." Hui Feng was famous for his poetry, which was different from Mr. Chen's. Every time they discussed articles, they had different opinions, which accumulated to the point that they could not get along. Hui Feng was aggressive and often criticized Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen was slow and rarely spoke to him. He maintained a respectful appearance and said to others in private, "Literary people have always looked down on each other. It is common for them to be slightly disrespectful in their words. But who would really care about it?" People praised him for his tolerance. In his later years, he suffered from paralysis and could not walk well, so he rarely went out. He had tens of thousands of volumes of books. His family was also slightly better off than before, so he moved to his original home in Xinghua. It had been seventy years since he had temporarily lived in Yancheng. Sometimes he was well-fed and sometimes he was not. He passed away in his hometown on a certain day of a certain month in the 20th year of the Republic of China. He was seventy-three years old. In his youth, he styled himself Baiyaosheng, and was also known as Kuisheng. Later, he called himself Suo. He wrote "Selection of Learning Essays," "Kuisheng Records," "Two Volumes of Learning Making Parallel Prose," "Travel to Hangzhou Poetry Records," "Bingyin Nostalgia Poems," and "Travel to Hangzhou Poems," as well as many volumes of "Annotations on Shishuo Xinyu," "Huang's Notes on Wenxin Diaolong," "Supplementary Annotations on Yanshi Jiaxun," "Annotations on Du Shi Zhengxuan," "Annotations on Han Shi Zhengxuan," and several kinds of unofficial historical novels such as "Shi Gu Cuo Yu Yao Guo Yong Tan." He edited and compiled "Tao Zhai Collection of Stone Records and Annotations" for Duan Zhongmin of Fengrun, "Liu's School Notes and Du Ji School Notes of Guichi," "Kuxi Collection and Annotations" for Wu of Haifeng, and "Liu Binke's Literary Collection Sima Biaosheng's Literary Collection School Edition" for Zhu of Renhe. He edited "Yu Feng Zhi and Taicang Zhi" for Miao of Zhenyang and "Notes on the Deeds of An Lushan" for Miao of Jiangyin. From his youth to his old age, Mr. Chen never stopped reading, even when he was suffering from illness and confinement. He recorded everything he saw and read. He had eighty volumes of diaries stored at home. His wives, Zhao, Liu, and Zhou, were all kind and virtuous. He had five sons, the eldest being Renyou, who was adopted to his father's brother. The others were Hongyou, Wuyou, Jingyou, and Chengyou. He had one daughter, Wanjuan, eight grandsons, and four granddaughters. After Mr. Chen passed away in a certain month, his adopted son and others claimed that he had written a will asking to be worshipped. Alas, heaven has taken away such talent, leaving no one behind. The spirit of the world is exhausted. I weep and write this to scold the world and the passersby. Who else will tell the story? My friend, Chen Xunzheng of Cixi, said that the form arrived in the north. Could it not be the Jinpu Road? Later, I read the newspaper and his words were indeed confirmed. It was not even five days later. The next person was a certain deputy minister who had once been in charge of the Ministry of Finance. Together with a certain director of the Department of Finance of a certain province, he stepped down due to a political change. He asked if there was any hope of rising again. The diviner judged based on the image and was quite accurate. The deputy minister was also familiar with mathematics and praised the diviner for being insightful. The diviner laughed and said to the director, "Are you not a follower of Chen Jichang? Your wife's temperament is no less strong than the lioness of Hedong. Looking at your fate, you must still have the worry of Bo Dao. Is that so or not?" The director said sadly, "I believe what you say. Will I end up as a ghost of Ruo Ao?" The diviner said, "No. You will surely have a daughter in five years of the Mao Yun. But accumulate virtue and do good deeds to respond to the will of heaven. It is up to you to take care of yourself." The director was so impressed that he couldn't help but bow deeply, saying, "I am willing to respectfully accept your teachings." The diviner then brewed tea and added incense, and they talked about the affairs of the world and criticized the figures of the time. His brilliant ideas flowed like a spring, and those who heard him were impressed. I stood by and listened, unaware of the passage of time. I saw that the diviner's speech was elegant and refined, unlike ordinary fortune tellers. So I asked about his life. I didn't know that he was Xu Suichu, the Daoyin of Yangxian. When I was young, I was shocked by his political reputation. He traveled north and south as an official, and his footprints were all over the world. He was chivalrous and righteous, generous and hospitable. Whether they knew him or not, everyone admired him for his character. I admired him but had no chance to meet him. How could I know that he would retire and hide in divination like Junping to tell the affairs of the world? He can be said to know the three flavors of good travel and the spirit of opportunity.</p>

<p>Double Towers in the Midst of War (14)</p>
<p>Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Master Qi</p>
<p>In the second episode, he talks and laughs with his good teacher and delivers bad news. His home was robbed, and he pities his close friend who is all alone. A spring feeling arises in the inn.</p>
<p>Wei Zhuomou said that he had cried in his apartment for two days. He still had no solution. He wanted to go home to take care of the funeral, but he was afraid that the feud between the bandits and his family was too deep and they would use the vicious trick of cutting the grass and rooting out the roots. It would be bad for him. If he didn't go back, not only would the family affairs not be able to be taken care of, but he would also be alone in Beijing, which was not a long-term plan. This morning, I received this news from elsewhere. I went to his apartment to visit him. He grabbed my hand and cried. His eye sockets were swollen like walnuts. Liang Xiaoyun suddenly jumped up and said, "No, he can't just go home. He's the only one left in his family. How can he go and take such a big risk? I'm a very good friend of his. At this difficult time, I should go and comfort him and advise him not to act rashly and take care of himself. If he has any difficulties, I can still do my best to help him." As she said this, she hurriedly called the nanny to prepare the washing water and the clothes and shoes for going out. For a while, she wiped her face and changed her clothes. She was very busy. She also said to Wei Zhuomou, "Please, will you accompany me?" Wei Zhuomou thought for a while and said, "You are so enthusiastic for your friends, which I admire very much. Of course, I should accompany you. But I have something else to do this afternoon. I want to say goodbye after I send you to the entrance of the apartment." Liang Xiaoyun didn't have time to say more to him at this time. She hurriedly dressed and was ready. The car had just called and was honking the horn outside the gate. She dragged Wei Zhuomou out and ran straight to the car. "Let's go," she said. The two of them staggered into the car. Wei Zhuomou told the driver an address. The car drove quickly to the street of Daan Apartment. Liang Xiaoyun sat in the car, staring straight at the back of the driver's head with her round eyes. It seemed that her heart was beating fast and she was complaining that the driver was not driving fast enough. She wished she could keep urging him to fly to her destination. Seeing that she had no intention of paying attention to him, Wei Zhuomou had no choice but to sit silently in a corner and say nothing. Finally, the car stopped suddenly. Liang Xiaoyun was the first to jump out. She looked up and saw that it was indeed Daan Apartment. She had come here once or twice before. She knew which courtyard An Yutian's room was located in. She didn't care if there were other people inside or if An Yutian was at home. She quickened her pace and rushed in. When she got inside, it was quiet and desolate. Only An Yutian was guarding this empty room alone. She saw him lying on the bed with his clothes on, his body stretched straight. He covered his face with a broken book. It was impossible to tell whether he was swallowing his tears or falling asleep. But judging from the gray-green Zhongshan tunic he was wearing and the Zhongshan-brand rubber shoes on his feet, it was definitely An Yutian. She couldn't help but walk to the bed and blurted out, "Yutian, what's wrong with you?" An Yutian, who was lying on the bed, wasn't asleep. Hearing the sound, he took off the book from his face and glanced at her. He hurriedly jumped up and said, "How did you come?"</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<p>Financial Market</p>
<p>Gold Standard Turns to Peak</p>
<p>Soars 14 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold standard continued its peak, with the situation fluctuating around 690 taels. Dealers' intentions were firm, with a daily difference of 10 taels. In the end, it soared by 14 taels. Various firms sought supply one after another. It rose as soon as it opened, because the silver market continued to fall the day before, and then both official and unofficial exchange rates rose. Moreover, there was settlement, causing the listing to shrink by 2.5%. Especially because major players and short sellers were scrambling to buy, the market suddenly took off. It once rose to 96 or 7 taels. Around noon, the selling pressure suddenly increased, and the exchange rate seemed to have weakened. It had already fallen back to 90 taels. The market rebounded slightly later, and the situation was still stable. The result was above 90 taels. However, the two-month exchange for the three-month contract (which was not settled last Saturday) was mutually exchanged by Tongfeng Heng and Tong Taichang, and the premium was only 1.5 to 7.5%, which was due to the abundance of cash. Therefore, the premium was small.</p>
<p>The opening jumped by 9.2 taels. From the early opening, it rose by 9.2 qian to 688 taels. The major silver bar fell by another 0.165 the day before, and the silver price fell by 0.083. Then it decreased by slightly over a tael to 86 taels and 8 qian. However, Cuichang, Yongsen, Changyong Shunli, and Wanxing all bought, and the price immediately rose by more than 8 taels. As for the exchange rate tightening, the initial settlement for the April British gold was 10 pence 6875. Then, Sanjing issued April American gold at 625. At 9:10, it rose to 95 taels and 2 qian. Before long, it fell back by more than 3 taels. Tong Taichang and Dadecheng sold out. Moreover, because the British and Japanese banks recently mutually traded American gold at 75, and HSBC issued the next month at 6875, the gold price fell to around 91 taels. The HSBC listing had shrunk by 0.375. American gold was stable at 75, only adding one tael to 92 taels and 5 qian. However, Erjing followed the February British gold at 625, and it immediately retreated to 89 taels and 5 qian. After entering the market, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yufuchang, Senchang Yongqian, Changxiang Tong, and Taichang all scrambled to buy, causing the British gold to settle at only 0.5 pence. Moreover, the March American gold was 4375, so the gold price jumped by 4 taels to 96 taels and 8 qian at 10:45. Then it seemed to weaken, because the exchange market was loosening. The forward settlement could be 6875. Especially because Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongbing, Xingheng, and Yifeng successively sold out, the price could not be sustained and lost 6 or 7 taels. After 11:30, it returned to within 90 taels, only counting 88 taels and 8 qian. However, buyers were very active. After 11:45, it pulled up again by more than 2 taels to 91 taels and 2 qian. The noon close was 89 taels and 5 qian. It continued to rise to 90 taels. The initial quoted price was 744 taels, a difference of 52 or 3 taels to 48 taels. Later, it was changed to 747 taels, a difference of 50 taels. At noon, it was 57 or 8 taels.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, it entered a fluctuating state. The after-market opened and immediately rose to 93, because the Bombay report was a small 88 anna. Moreover, the forward price was a small 10 anna. Only because another party sold out, it retreated to 91 taels and 2 qian. Suddenly, Yuanmao Yongchun Yuanyong goods came in, immediately adding more than 2 taels. At 2:15, it was 93 taels and 9 qian, while American gold settled at 6875. Later, the April British gold was exchanged for 5625. Sanjing also issued American gold at 6875. Hengyu, Taichang, Fuyu, Yuanmao Yong, Xingyong Yuanheng, and others sold a lot in the market. Therefore, it retreated to 88 taels and 5 qian at 3:00. Afterwards, there was a repetition of the situation. From around 3:30, there was a 4-tael plate. Dadecheng Yifeng Yong and others bought in, while Tong Taichang sold out. In an instant, buyers were active, such as Hengyu Tianfeng Yong Dadecheng, and others all scrambled to buy.

<p>Difficulty in Silver Dollar Market Turnover</p>
<p>General Market Situation</p>
<p>In the midst of a calm market and business expansion in the financial circles of Shanghai, the frequent inflow and outflow of silver dollars was originally a normal business activity, which should naturally become more and more profitable. However, at present, there is unrest everywhere, and the disasters of war and soldiers are causing grief throughout the land. It is impossible to seek the prosperity of business affairs. Shanghai is the hub of our country's commercial market. When it encounters alarms and losses, it bears the brunt. Now, facing this sudden and unexpected change in the market, it is not expected to turn around. The situation suddenly feels deserted, like a patient who has been ill for a long time and has not recovered, and is in a state of decline. Especially for the money shops, the losses this year are particularly boundless.</p>

The early market for small silver dollars in Guangdong was 6 qian 6 fen and 1 li, and the noon market was 6 qian 6 fen and 0.25 hao. Transactions were 215,000 jiao in the early market and 75,000 jiao in the noon market. Steel yuan were slightly short by 500 wen, which was 372,500 wen. Transactions were more than 31,000 strings.</p>

<p>Zhang Xilin Kidnapping Case: Four Bandits Sentenced to Death, Other Bandits Sentenced to More Than Ten Years</p>
<p>Zhang Xilin, manager of the Lishengchang Silk Store at No. 147 Shandong Road, was kidnapped by bandits at 6:50 PM on October 2nd of last year at the store entrance. He was held in a straw hut in Gong's residence, west of Zhoujiaqiao on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai, and a large ransom was demanded. Chief Detective Huang Fusen and Jiang Shangpei of the General Inspectorate investigated the case and collaborated with Chinese Detective Chief Zhang Zhiqing, Detective Geng Delu, Kang Zengxiang, and others, along with Deputy Western Detective Mike Wylen, to rescue Zhang. A gun battle ensued, and Detective Mike was shot and injured. One bandit, Liu Jinhua, was killed, and another, Jiang Weiliang, was wounded. The authorities subsequently arrested kidnappers Shi Zhongfu, Tian Chengxiang, Xu A'gen, Miao Xingyuan, Qian Nanyun, Ding De Zhao, Yan Shaoshan, Jin Yuxiang, Jiang Huangshi (a woman), Jiang Yonglin, Wang Xingcun (assistant to lawyer Li Ming), Lu Zhengzhi, Yu Xiaofang, and others.

Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police stated that although the defendant Wang Xingcun had been acquitted, he had been sentenced to four months of imprisonment in a self-prosecution case for embezzlement (filed by the Anhui Fellow Association), and requested that he remain in custody. The court approved the request and ordered that Xu A'hen be released on bail of 200 yuan pending appeal.</p>
<p>A Small Village in Gaoqiao, Pudong, Robbed by Bandits</p>
<p>A Gang of Outlaws Runs Rampant</p>
<p>The Sun Family Designs to Avoid Disaster</p>
<p>Gaoqiao Town in Pudong is located on the coast and has always been an area frequented by bandits. Since the beginning of winter, local ruffians have colluded with bandits from elsewhere to commit robberies everywhere, making it difficult for the villagers to sleep peacefully. Around 1:00 AM the night before last, a small village about three miles from the town, inhabited by more than twenty rural families, mostly poor farmers, was attacked. Only the Sun family was relatively well-off. A large gang of more than one hundred bandits, armed with torches and weapons, entered the village and fired shots to intimidate the residents. They then looted house by house. The villagers were already asleep at the time, and seeing that the bandits were armed with knives, guns, and other weapons, they dared not resist and allowed them to search their homes. All their clothes, silver, and valuables were taken away. However, the Sun family, upon hearing the continuous gunshots and the cries of women and children, knew that there was a robbery. They immediately instructed all members of the family, young and old, to hide their valuables and clothing on their bodies and sneak out through the back door into the depths of the bamboo forest. They also opened the front door and hid themselves. The bandits passed by the front of the house and, seeing the door open, suspected that it had already been robbed. Unaware of the "empty city" strategy, they did not enter, and the Sun family suffered no losses. This was indeed a great stroke of luck in the midst of misfortune. As a result, more than ten families in the village were robbed, suffering losses of three to four thousand yuan. After obtaining their loot, the bandits fired shots and shouted as they fled. At daybreak, the victims compiled a list of their losses and, together with the local security guard, reported the incident to the Third District and Fourth Police Station of Gaoqiao Town, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Shipping Bureau Investigates the Loss of the Deda Steamer</p>
<p>Orders Payment of Compensation to Families of Victims</p>
<p>Company Agrees to Hold Shareholders Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>The Deda steamer of the Dada Shipping Company was previously destroyed by fire, and many passengers were burned to death or drowned, resulting in many deaths and injuries. Subsequently, the Ministry of Communications ordered that, as the company's ships had been involved in accidents more than once, there were doubts as to whether the equipment of each ship was complete and ordered the Shanghai Shipping Bureau to thoroughly investigate. After receiving the order, the bureau sent technicians to the Dada Shipping Company to inspect the equipment of each ship, and no discrepancies were found. Subsequently, the bureau summoned the captain of the Deda steamer, Le Changming, Chief Mate Tang Donghai, Second Mate Zhu Lianqing, Public Engineer Guo Hengchang, Watchman Hu Gengsheng, and passenger Lu Dayou, among others, to inquire about the circumstances at the time in order to make a judgment regarding the responsibility for the incident. The bureau has not yet appointed a representative, and Yang Qingbang went to the bureau. The Shipping Bureau ordered Yang to first distribute compensation to the families of the victims of the Deda steamer. Yang replied that the compensation would be borne by the shareholders and would be reported to the Shipping Bureau after the Dada shareholders' meeting next month. Furthermore, after the accident, various newspapers reported inconsistent numbers of passenger deaths, with some saying 300, some saying 100, and some saying more than 20. According to the Shipping Bureau's investigation, there were approximately 80 deaths, including more than 60 who drowned and more than 10 who were burned to death.</p>

<p>Young Woman Saved from Attempted Suicide in the Sea</p>
<p>Due to an Argument with Her Family</p>
<p>Around 10:00 AM yesterday, a young woman wearing a light blue silk qipao and a tweed overcoat was seen pacing back and forth on the seawall outside the North Gate of Baoshan, at Xiaoshabei. Farmers, women, and children in the vicinity gathered to watch because the woman's clothing was quite unusual. The woman seemed displeased and had tears in her eyes. She turned and walked north. The farmers followed her. Unexpectedly, the woman rushed down the seawall and jumped into the sea. The farmers, realizing that she was attempting suicide, were greatly alarmed and called for more farmers to go to the seaside and try to rescue her. They managed to pull the woman out of the sea and asked her why she had tried to commit suicide, but she wept without answering. Later, the farmers escorted her to the Wusong Public Security Bureau for questioning. She identified herself as Xia Sufang, aged 23, residing in a certain neighborhood on Carter Road in the city. She stated that she had argued with her family over a trivial matter and had attempted suicide out of anger. The bureau sent police officers to Shanghai to notify her family, who took her home.</p>
<p>Worker Beaten with Fake Gun, Brain Matter Ejected, Life in Danger</p>
<p>The dormitory for staff and workers of the Hefeng Domestic Porcelain Company at No. 62 Edward Road is located at No. 2 Shudeli, Zihua Road in the city. Around 9:00 AM yesterday, a few staff members were still in bed upstairs when a worker named Zhang Gonglin, 49 years old, from Ningbo, was working downstairs. Two young men in Western suits suddenly entered and asked if the "boss" was in. Zhang replied that he was not. One of the men pulled out a fake gun and pressed it against Zhang's chest, threatening him. He pretended to fire, but no bullets came out. Zhang became bolder and resisted. The bandit then used the butt of the gun to hit Zhang's head several times, causing him to bleed profusely and even eject brain matter. Zhang shouted for help and fainted. When the staff members upstairs heard the alarm and rushed downstairs, the bandits had already fled. They could only take the injured man to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are too severe and his life is in danger.</p>

<p>Chairman of Silk Factory Association Discusses the Crisis of the Silk Factory Industry</p>
<p>Only One-Tenth Can Barely Maintain Operation</p>
<p>Complete Shutdown Expected Within Days Due to Industry Practices</p>
<p>There are 106 single-reeling and 7 double-reeling silk factories in the city. Affected by years of decline, they have been unable to maintain operations and have successively announced shutdowns to await opportunities. Although the Ministry of Finance issued silk industry bonds to address the symptoms, 4 million yuan was like a drop in the bucket. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency heard that all silk factories in the city would completely shut down within days. As this was a major matter, he drove to visit Shen Huachen, chairman of the Silk Factory Industry Association, to inquire about the truth. According to Shen, the silk factory industry has long been in a state of unsustainable operation and has become even more depressed since the September 18th Incident. The cost of each load of cocoons is 850 taels for spring cocoons and 950 taels for autumn cocoons. With the addition of 200 taels for reeling, the cost per load is over 1,000 taels. The current price of silk in the United States is $1.70 per pound in US dollars, equivalent to about 720 taels in Chinese currency. Therefore, each load is bound to lose 400 taels. Although there is a market price, silk merchants are unwilling to sell due to the huge losses. Moreover, the amounts pledged at money shops or banks are all above 800 taels. As of today, the silk factories that are barely maintaining operations are Baotai, Tongyi, and Rixin in the South Shanghai District; Yuanfeng and Qiaqiang in the Hongkou District; Xinchang in the concession area; and Dingchangshun and others in the Zhabei District, totaling ten factories, less than one-tenth of the city's total. A complete shutdown is expected within days. The reason is that the silk factory industry has traditionally closed at the end of the lunar year because female workers must return to their hometowns for the New Year. The factories temporarily close for a final accounting and to repair furnaces. Work is expected to resume around the 20th day of the second lunar month. However, due to the impact of the current situation, this year's silk factories are in a worse situation than in previous years. There is considerable concern about reopening on the 20th day of the second lunar month. If there is no change in the situation, farmers raising silkworms will be greatly affected. The cost of each load of fresh cocoons for farmers is at least 40 yuan. The purchase price of cocoons in the 20th year of the Republic was 45 to 60 yuan, so farmers' profits were very small. Based on observations of the silk industry in the 20th year of the Republic, very few factories purchased cocoons this spring, and the price of fresh cocoons was not expected to be high. Given the current price of silk, it would be only over 20 yuan. Under these circumstances, if there is no change in the situation, silkworm farmers in China will inevitably change their occupations to make a living and will inevitably convert all mulberry fields to other agricultural products. Therefore, the future of China's silk industry is very bleak.</p>
<p>No Resolution in Dispute at Wing On Third Factory</p>
<p>After the tragic incident at the Wing On Textile Second Factory in Wusong, the Municipal Social Bureau, under the instructions of the Municipal Government, mediated the labor dispute according to law and awaited the court's resolution on the murder case. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a labor-management mediation committee was convened to mediate the dispute over bonuses and the dismissal of seven workers and friends in accordance with the law. Peng Shun and Chen Kui of the Wing On Yarn Factory, Wang Yuncheng and Zhou Shengfa of the Eighth District Cotton Textile Industry Union, and Zeng Shengdian, section chief of the Third Section, attended as chairmen and committee members. The above issues were discussed in detail. The chairman of the committee advised the dismissed workers to allow them to return to work and to give bonuses as appropriate. The factory representatives agreed to go back and discuss with the manager before making a decision. The meeting was adjourned and it was announced that formal mediation would be held on another day. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, Wang Deming and other dismissed employees of the Wing On Second Factory were called again to facilitate mediation.</p>

<p>Dispute at Chunhua Rubber Factory</p>
<p>Union Provides Assistance to Injured Apprentices</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chunhua Rubber Factory on South City Scissors Bridge Road has seen its business increase daily. It employs more than 100 workers and about 30 apprentices. However, labor-management disputes arise from time to time. The factory is particularly strict with the apprentices, and the workers believe that the factory's discipline is inappropriate and amounts to abuse.

<p>Two Groups Telegraph Request to Retain Guo Waifeng in the China Merchants Bureau</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau Workers' Union and the China Merchants General Bureau Workers' Union telegraphed the National Government, stating to Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government and Premier Sun: "Your previous telegram has been submitted for your review. Since Commissioner Guo was appointed to reorganize the China Merchants Bureau, his achievements have been remarkable. However, the financial situation has not been eased. Fortunately, his skillful management has enabled the bureau to overcome difficulties. His resignation has aroused speculation from the outside world, and it coincides with the accounting period in the business community. If financial assistance is suspended and creditors press for payment, there will be no way to cope. Even the supply of ship fuel and coal will be interrupted. Not only will credit be lost and business disrupted, but the future of the national shipping industry will also be greatly affected. We, the members of the association, feel deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. We urge you again to grant the request in the previous telegram to retain him quickly, so as to eliminate doubts and maintain the status quo. We await your orders with anticipation. China Merchants General Bureau Workers' Union."</p>
<p>The United Association of Marine Engineers of China telegraphed the Central Government, stating to the Ministry of Communications of the Central National Government: "We are reporting that Commissioner Guo of the China Merchants Bureau has requested resignation. We sincerely request that he be retained to reorganize the shipping affairs and maintain national rights. We have investigated that the China Merchants Bureau has a large number of ships in various ports and its income and expenditures are complex. Few of the past directors have made precise statistics. However, Commissioner Guo announced his policies step by step at the beginning of his term. He cut redundant staff internally to save expenses, and expanded shipping and increased revenue externally, making every effort to reorganize the bureau. We hope that he will make progress day by day to achieve perfection. If he retires suddenly, will not all his previous efforts be wasted? This is for the benefit of the bureau. We sincerely request that you retain him quickly. The union is close by and its observations are more real. Since the East Province incident, the Chinese people have been angered by righteousness. Japanese ships such as Nisshin and Osaka have been cut off. This is a good opportunity for the development of national shipping, and it is time to expand shipping rights. If Commissioner Guo works hard and moves forward, it will not be difficult to regain all shipping rights. Moreover, the current staff of the China Merchants Bureau, from top to bottom, are of one mind, and there will be no obstacles to implementing policies. It is the perfect time to make progress. This is for the benefit of the country. We sincerely request that you retain him quickly, and it will reorganize shipping affairs and maintain national rights. The union will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. "</p>
